<P>SUCH is the Power of In|tere&s;t
over almo&s;t every
Mind, that no one is long with|out
Arguments to prove any

any Mea&s;ures which are dictated

By this &s;ubtil Sophi&s;try of
De&s;ire, I have been per&s;uaded
to hope, that this Book may,
without Impropriety, be in|&s;cribed
to Your Lord&s;hip; but
am not certain, that my Rea|&s;ons
will have the &s;ame Force
upon other Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>The Dread which a Writer
feels of the public Cen&s;ure; the
&s;till greater Dread of Neglect;
and the eager Wi&s;h for Support
and Protection, which is im|pre&s;&s;ed
by the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
Imbecillity; are unknown to
tho&s;e who have never adventured
into the World; and I am afraid,
my Lord, equally unknown to
tho&s;e, who have always found
the World ready to applaud
them.</P>

'Tis, therefore, not unlikely,

<P>But, whatever be &s;uppo&s;ed

<HEAD>THE
Female QUIXOTE. BOOK I.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Contains a Turn at Court, neither new
nor &s;urpri&s;ing&mdash;Some u&s;ele&s;s Additions
to a fine Lady's Education&mdash;The bad
Effects of a whim&s;ical Study, which
&s;ome will &s;ay is borrowed from Cer|vantes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THE Marquis of&mdash;for a long Se|ries
of Years, was the fir&s;t and mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hed Favourite at Court:
He held the mo&s;t honourable
Employments under the Crown,
di&s;po&s;ed of all Places of Profit as he plea&s;ed,
pre&s;ided at the Council, and in a manner
governed the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="18">
This exten&s;ive Authority could not fail of
making him many Enemies: He fell at la&s;t a
Sacrifice to the Plots they were continually
forming again&s;t him; and was not only re|moved
from all his Employments, but bani&s;hed
the Court for ever.</P>
<P>The Pain his unde&s;erved Di&s;grace gave him,
he was enabled to conceal by the natural
Haughtine&s;s of his Temper; and, behaving
rather like a Man who had re&s;igned, than been
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his Po&s;ts, he imagined he
triumphed &s;ufficiently over the Malice of his
Enemies, while he &s;eemed to be wholly in|&s;en&s;ible
of the Effects it produced. His &s;ecret
Di&s;content, however, was &s;o much augmented
by the Opportunity he now had of ob&s;erving
the Ba&s;ene&s;s and Ingratitude of Mankind,
which in &s;ome Degree he experienced every
Day, that he re&s;olved to quit all Society what|ever,
and devote the re&s;t of his Life to Solitude
and Privacy. For the Place of his Retreat he
pitched upon a Ca&s;tle he had in a very remote
Province of the Kingdom, in the Neighbour|hood
of a &s;mall Village, and &s;everal Miles di&s;tant
from any Town. The va&s;t Extent of Ground
which &s;urrounded this noble Building, he had
cau&s;ed to be laid out in a Manner peculiar to
his Ta&s;te: The mo&s;t laborious Endeavours of
Art had been u&s;ed to make it appear like the
beautiful Product of wild, uncultivated Nature.
But if this Epitome of <HI>Arcadia</HI> could boa&s;t of
only artle&s;s and &s;imple Beauties, the In&s;ide of
the Ca&s;tle was adorned with a Magnificence
&s;uitable to the Dignity and immen&s;e Riches of
the Owner.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="19">
While Things were preparing at the Ca&s;tle
for his Reception, the Marquis, though now
advanced in Years, ca&s;t his Eyes on a young
Lady, greatly inferior to him&s;elf in Quality,
but who&s;e Beauty and good Sen&s;e promi&s;ed
him an agreeable Companion. After a very
&s;hort Court&s;hip, he married her, and in a few
Weeks carried his new Bride into the Country,
from whence he ab&s;olutely re&s;olved never to
Return.</P>
<P>The Marquis, following the Plan of Life
he had laid down, divided his Time between
the Company of his Lady, his Library, which
was large and well furni&s;hed, and his Gardens.
Sometimes he took the Diver&s;ion of Hunting,
but never admitted any Company whatever;
and his Pride and extreme Re&s;erve rendered
him &s;o wholly inacce&s;&s;ible to the Country
Gentry about him, that none ever pre&s;umed
to &s;olicit his Acquaintance.</P>
<P>In the Second Year of his Retirement, the
Marchione&s;s brought him a Daughter, and
died in Three Days after her Delivery. The
Marquis, who had tenderly loved her, was
extremely afflicted at her Death; but Time
having produced its u&s;ual Effects, his great
Fondne&s;s for the little <HI>Arabella</HI> intirely en|gro&s;&s;ed
his Attention, and made up all the
Happine&s;s of his Life. At Four Years of
Age he took her from under the Direction of
the Nur&s;es and Women appointed to attend
her, and permitted her to receive no Part of her
Education from another, which he was capable
of giving her him&s;elf. He taught her to read
and write in a very few Months; and, as &s;he
<PB N="4" REF="20">
grew older, finding in her an uncommon
Quickne&s;s of Apprehen&s;ion, and an Under|&s;tanding
capable of great Improvements, he
re&s;olved to cultivate &s;o promi&s;ing a Genius
with the utmo&s;t Care; and, as he frequently,
in the Rapture of paternal Fondne&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf, render her Mind as beautiful as her
Per&s;on was lovely.</P>
<P>Nature had indeed given her a mo&s;t charm|ing
Face, a Shape ea&s;y and delicate, a &s;weet and
in&s;inuating Voice, and an Air &s;o full of Dig|nity
and Grace, as drew the Admiration of all
that &s;aw her. The&s;e native Charms were im|proved
with all the Heightenings of Art; her
Dre&s;s was perfectly magnificent; the be&s;t
Ma&s;ters of Mu&s;ic and Dancing were &s;ent for
from <HI>London</HI> to attend her. She &s;oon became
a perfect Mi&s;tre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI>
Languages, under the Care of her Father;
and it is not to be doubted, but &s;he would
have made a great Proficiency in all u&s;eful
Knowlege, had not her whole Time been
taken up by another Study.</P>
<P>From her earlie&s;t Youth &s;he had di&s;covered
a Fondne&s;s for Reading, which extremely de|lighted
the Marquis; he permitted her there|fore
the U&s;e of his Library, in which, unfor|tunately
for her, were great Store of Ro|mances,
and, what was &s;till more unfortunate,
not in the original <HI>French,</HI> but very bad
Tran&s;lations.</P>
<P>The decea&s;ed Marchione&s;s had purcha&s;ed
the&s;e Books to &s;often a Solitude which &s;he
found very di&s;agreeable; and, after her Death,
<PB N="5" REF="21">
the Marquis removed them from her Clo&s;er
into his Library, where <HI>Arabella</HI> found them.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;ing Adventures with which
they were filled, proved a mo&s;t plea&s;ing Enter|tainment
to a young Lady, who was wholly
&s;ecluded from the World; who had no other
Diver&s;ion, but ranging like a Nymph through
Gardens, or, to &s;ay better, the Woods and
Lawns in which &s;he was inclo&s;ed; and who
had no other Conver&s;ation but that of a grave
and melancholy Father, or her own Attend|ants.</P>
<P>Her Ideas, from the Manner of her Life,
and the Objects around her, had taken a
romantic Turn; and, &s;uppo&s;ing Romances
were real Pictures of Life, from them &s;he
drew all her Notions and Expectations. By
them &s;he was taught to believe, that Love was
the ruling Principle of the World; that every
other Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;ubordinate to this; and
that it cau&s;ed all the Happine&s;s and Mi&s;eries of
Life. Her Gla&s;s, which &s;he often con&s;ulted,
always &s;hewed her a Form &s;o extremely lovely,
that, not finding her&s;elf engaged in &s;uch Ad|ventures
as were common to the Heroines in
the Romances &s;he read, &s;he often complained
of the In&s;en&s;ibility of Mankind, upon whom
her Charms &s;eemed to have &s;o little Influence.</P>
<P>The perfect Retirement &s;he lived in, af|forded
indeed no Opportunities of making the
Conque&s;ts &s;he de&s;ired; but &s;he could not
comprehend, how any Solitude could be ob|&s;cure
enough to conceal a Beauty like hers
from Notice; and thought the Reputation of
her Charms &s;ufficient to bring a Croud of
<PB N="6" REF="22">
Adorers to demand her of her Father. Her
Mind being wholly filled with the mo&s;t extra|vagant
Expectations, &s;he was alarmed by every
trifling Incident; and kept in a continual An|xiety
by a Vici&s;&s;itude of Hopes, Fears, Wi&s;hes,
and Di&s;appointments.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Contains a De&s;cription of a Lady's Dre&s;s
in Fa&s;hion not much above Two thou&s;and
Years ago.&mdash;The Beginning of an Ad|venture
which &s;eems to promi&s;e a great
deal.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> had now entered into her
Seventeenth Year with the Regret of &s;ee|ing
her&s;elf the Object of Admiration to a few
Ru&s;tics only, who happened to &s;ee her; when,
one <HI>Sunday,</HI> making u&s;e of the Permi&s;&s;ion the
Marquis &s;ometimes allowed her, to attend. Di|vine
Service at the Church belonging to the
Village near which they lived, her Vanity was
flattered with an Adorer not altogether unwor|thy
of her Notice.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was young, gay, hand|&s;ome,
and very elegantly dre&s;&s;ed; he was ju&s;t
come from <HI>London</HI> with an Intention to pa&s;s
&s;ome Weeks with a Friend in that Part of the
Country; and at the time <HI>Arabella</HI> entered
the Church, his Eyes, which had wandered
from one rural Fair to another, were in an In|&s;tant
fixed upon her Face. She blu&s;hed with
a very becoming Mode&s;ty; and, plea&s;ed with
<PB N="7" REF="23">
the unu&s;ual Appearance of &s;o fine a Gentleman,
and the particular Notice he took of her, pa&s;&s;ed
on to her Seat thro' a double Row of Country
People, who, with a Profu&s;ion of aukward Bows
and Courte&s;ies, expre&s;&s;ed their Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> for that was the Stranger's
Name, was no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at her Beauty,
than the Singularity of her Dre&s;s; and the odd
Whim of being followed into the Church by
three Women-Attendants, who, as &s;oon as &s;he
was &s;eated, took their Places behind her.</P>
<P>Her Dre&s;s, tho' &s;ingular, was far from be|ing
unbecoming. All the Beauties of her Neck
and Shape were &s;et off to the greate&s;t Advan|tage
by the Fa&s;hion of her Gown, which, in the
Manner of a Robe, was made to &s;it tight to
her Body; and fa&s;tened on the Brea&s;t with a
Knot of Diamonds. Her fine black Hair, hung
upon her Neck in Curls, which had &s;o much
the Appearance of being artle&s;s, that all but
her Maid, who&s;e Employment it was to give
them that Form, imagined they were &s;o. Her
Head-dre&s;s was only a few Knots advantage|ou&s;ly
di&s;po&s;ed, over which &s;he wore a white
Sar&s;enet Hood, &s;omewhat in the Form of a
Veil, with which &s;he &s;ometimes wholly cover|ed
her fair Face, when &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf beheld
with too much Attention.</P>
<P>This Veil had never appeared to her &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary
before. Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI>'s eager Glances
threw her into &s;o much Confu&s;ion, that, pulling
it over her Face as much as &s;he was able, &s;he
remained invi&s;ible to him all the time they af|terwards
&s;tayed in the Church. This Action,
by which &s;he would have had him under&s;tand
<PB N="8" REF="24">
that &s;he was di&s;plea&s;ed at his gazing on her
with &s;o little Re&s;pect, only increa&s;ed his Curi|o&s;ity
to know who &s;he was.</P>
<P>When the Congregation was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, he
ha&s;tened to the Door, with an Intention to of|fer
her his Hand to help her to her Coach; but
&s;eeing the magnificent Equipage that waited
for her, and the Number of Servants that at|tended
it, he conceived a much higher Idea of
her Quality than he had at fir&s;t; and, changing
his De&s;ign, contented him&s;elf with only bowing
to her as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed; and as &s;oon as her Coach
drove away, inquired of &s;ome Per&s;ons neare&s;t
him, who &s;he was?</P>
<P>The&s;e Ru&s;tics, highly delighted with the
Opportunity of talking to the gay <HI>Londoner,</HI>
whom they looked upon as a very extraordinary
Per&s;on, gave him all the Intelligence they were
able, concerning the Lady he inquired after;
and filled him with an inconceivable Surprize at
the &s;trange Humour of the Marquis, who bu|ried
&s;o beautiful a Creature in Ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>At his Return home he expre&s;&s;ed his Admi|ration
of her in Terms that per&s;uaded his Friend,
&s;he had made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on his Heart;
and, after raillying him a little upon this Su&s;pi|cion,
he a&s;&s;umed a more &s;erious Air, and told
him, If he really liked Lady <HI>Bella;</HI> he thought
it not impo&s;&s;ible but he might obtain her. The
poor Girl, added he, has been kept in Confine|ment
&s;o long, that I believe it would not be dif|ficult
to per&s;uade her to free her&s;elf by Marriage.
She never had a Lover in her Life; and there|fore
the fir&s;t Per&s;on who addre&s;&s;es her has the
faire&s;t Chance for &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="25">
Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> tho' he could not per&s;uade him|&s;elf
his Cou&s;in was in Earne&s;t when he advi&s;ed
him to court the only Daughter of a Man of
the Marquis's Quality, and Heire&s;s to his va&s;t
E&s;tates; yet reli&s;hed the Scheme, and re&s;olved
to make &s;ome Attempt upon her before he left
the Country. However, he concealed his De|&s;ign
from his Cou&s;in, not being willing to ex|po&s;e
him&s;elf to be ridiculed, if he did not &s;uc|ceed;
and, turning the Advice he had given

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Adventure goes on after the
accu&s;tomed Manner.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> in the mean time, was
wholly taken up with the Adventure, as
&s;he called it, at Church: The Per&s;on and
Dre&s;s of the Gentleman who had &s;o particu|larly
gazed on her there, was &s;o different from
what &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee, that &s;he
immediately concluded, he was of &s;ome di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
Rank. It was pa&s;t a Doubt, &s;he
thought, that he was exce&s;&s;ively in Love with
her; and as &s;he &s;oon expected to have &s;ome
very extraordinary Proofs of his Pa&s;&s;ion, her
Thoughts were wholly employed on the Man|ner
in which &s;he &s;hould receive them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he came home, and had paid
her Duty to the Marquis, &s;he hurried to her
Chamber, to be at Liberty to indulge her agree|able
<PB N="10" REF="26">
Reflections; and, after the Example of
her Heroines, when any thing extraordinary
happened to them, called her favourite Wo|man;
or, to u&s;e her own Language, her,
<Q>in whom &s;he confided her mo&s;t &s;ecret
Thoughts.</Q></P>
<P>Well, <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, did you ob&s;erve that
Stranger who ey'd <HI>us</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Heroines always &s;peak of them&s;elves in the Plural Number.</NOTE> &s;o heedfully To-day at
Church?</P>
<P>This Girl, notwith&s;tanding her Country-Simplicity,
knew a Compliment was expected
from her on this Occa&s;ion; and therefore re|plied,
<Q>That &s;he did not wonder at the Gen|tleman's
&s;taring at her; for &s;he was &s;ure he
had never &s;een any body &s;o hand&s;ome as her
Lady&s;hip before.</Q></P>
<P>I have not all the Beauty you attribute to me,
&s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;miling a little: And, with a very
moderate Share of it, I might well fix the At|tention
of a Per&s;on who &s;eemed to be not over|much
plea&s;ed with the Objects about him:
However, pur&s;ued &s;he, a&s;&s;uming a more &s;eri|ous
Air, if this Stranger be weak enough to en|tertain
any Sentiments more than indifferent
for me; I charge you, upon Pain of my Di&s;|plea&s;ure,
do not be acce&s;&s;ary to the Conveying
his pre&s;umptuous Thoughts to me either by
Letters or Me&s;&s;ages; nor &s;uffer him to corrupt
your Fidelity with the Pre&s;ents he will very
probably offer you.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> to whom this Speech fir&s;t gave a Hint
of what &s;he ought to expect from her Lady's
Lovers, finding her&s;elf of more Importance
<PB N="11" REF="27">
than &s;he imagined, was &s;o plea&s;ed at the
Pro&s;pect which opened to her, that it was with
&s;ome He&s;itation &s;he promi&s;ed to obey her Or|ders.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> however, was &s;atisfied with her A&s;|&s;urances
of ob&s;erving her Directions; and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
her from her Pre&s;ence, not without an
Apprehen&s;ion of being too well obeyed.</P>
<P>A whole Week being elap&s;ed without meet|ing
with the Importunities &s;he expected, &s;he
could hardly conceal her Surprize at &s;o morti|fying
a Di&s;appointment; and frequently inter|rogated
<HI>Lucy,</HI> concerning any Attempts the
Stranger had made on her Fidelity; but the
An&s;wers &s;he received, only increa&s;ed her Di&s;|content,
as they convinced her, her Charms
had not had the Effect &s;he imagined.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> however, had been all this
time employed in thinking of &s;ome Means to
get acquainted with the Marquis; for, being
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an extraordinary Opinion of his
Wit, and per&s;onal Accompli&s;hments, he did
not fear making &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion on the Heart
of the young Lady; provided he could have an
Opportunity of conver&s;ing with her.</P>
<P>His Cou&s;in's Advice was continually in his
Mind, and flattered his Vanity with the mo&s;t
agreeable Hopes: But the Marquis's Fondne&s;s
for Solitude, and that Haughtine&s;s which was
natural to him, rendered him &s;o difficult of Ac|ce&s;s,
that <HI>Hervey,</HI> from the Intelligence he re|ceived
of his Humour, de&s;paired of being able
to pro&s;ecute his Scheme; when, meeting with
a young Farmer in one of his Evening-Walks,
and entering into Conver&s;ation with him upon
<PB N="12" REF="28">
&s;everal Country Subjects, the Di&s;cour&s;e at la&s;t
turned upon the Marquis of&mdash;who&s;e fine
Hou&s;e and Gardens were within their View;
upon which the young Fellow informed him,
he was Brother to a young Woman that at|tended
the Lady <HI>Arabella;</HI> and, being fond of
lengthening out the Conver&s;ation with &s;o fine a
Gentleman, gave him, without being de&s;ired,
the dome&s;tic Hi&s;tory of the whole Family, as
he had received it from <HI>Lucy,</HI> who was the
Si&s;ter he mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Hervey,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively delighted at this acci|dental
Meeting with a Per&s;on &s;o capable of
&s;erving his Defign, affected a great De&s;ire of
being better acquainted with him; and, under
Pretence of acquiring &s;ome Knowlege in rural
Affairs, accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to call &s;o often at
<HI>William</HI>'s Farm, that at la&s;t he met with the
Per&s;on whom the Hopes of &s;eeing had &s;o often
carried him thither.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> the Moment &s;he &s;aw him enter, know|ing
him again, blu&s;hed at the Remembrance
of the Di&s;cour&s;e which had pa&s;&s;ed between her
Lady and her&s;elf concerning him; and was not
at all &s;urpri&s;ed at the Endeavours he u&s;ed to
&s;peak to her apart: But, as &s;oon as he began a
Conver&s;ation concerning <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;he inter|rupted
him by &s;aying, I know, Sir, that you
are <HI>di&s;tractedly</HI> in Love with my Lady; but &s;he
has forbid me to receive any Letters or Me&s;&s;ages
from you; and therefore I beg you will not
offer to bribe me; for I dare not di&s;obey her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI> was at fir&s;t &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at her
Speech, that he knew not what to think of it;
but, after a little Reflection, attributing to an
<PB N="13" REF="29">
Exce&s;s of aukward Cunning what, in Reality,
was an Effect of her Simplicity, he re&s;olved to
make u&s;e of the Hint &s;he had given him; and,
pre&s;enting her with a Couple of Guineas, in|treated
her to venture di&s;plea&s;ing her Lady, by
bearing a Letter from him; promi&s;ing to re|ward
her better, if &s;he &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> made &s;ome Difficulty to comply; but,
not being able ab&s;olutely to refu&s;e the fir&s;t Bribe
that ever was offered to her, &s;he, after &s;ome
Intreaties, con&s;ented to take the Letter; and,
receiving the Money he pre&s;ented her, left him
at Liberty to write, after &s;he had got her Bro|ther
to furni&s;h him with Materials for that Pur|po&s;e.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Mi&s;take, which produces no great Con&s;e|quences
&mdash;An extraordinary Comment
upon a Behaviour natural enough&mdash;An
In&s;tance of a Lady's Compa&s;&s;ion for her
Lover, which the Reader may po&s;&s;ibly
think not very compa&s;&s;ionate.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>HERVEY,</HI> who was Ma&s;ter of no great
Elegance in Letter-writing, was at fir&s;t
at &s;ome Lo&s;s, how to addre&s;s a Lady of her
Quality, to whom he was an ab&s;olute Stranger,
upon the Subject of Love; but, conceiving
there was no great Occa&s;ion for much Cere|mony
in declaring him&s;elf to one who had been
educated in the Country, and who, he believ|ed,
could not be di&s;plea&s;ed with a Lover of his
<PB N="14" REF="30">
Figure, he therefore, in plain Terms, told
her, how <HI>deeply</HI> he was enamoured of her; and
conjured her to afford him &s;ome Opportunity
of paying his Re&s;pects to her.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> received this Letter from him with a
wor&s;e Grace than &s;he did the Gold; and, tho'
&s;he promi&s;ed him to deliver it to her Lady im|mediately,
yet &s;he kept it a Day or two before
&s;he had the Courage to attempt it: At la&s;t,
drawing it out of her Pocket, with a ba&s;hful
Air, &s;he pre&s;ented it to her Lady, telling her it
came from the fine Gentleman whom &s;he &s;aw
at Church.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> blu&s;hed at the Sight of the Letter;
and tho', in Reality, &s;he was not di&s;plea&s;ed,
yet, being a &s;trict Ob&s;erver of romantic Forms,
&s;he chid her Woman &s;everely for taking it.
Carry it back, added &s;he, to the pre&s;umptuous
Writer of it; and let him know how greatly
his In&s;olence has offended me.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> however, &s;uffered the Letter to re|main
on the Toilet, expecting &s;ome Change
in her Lady's Mind; for &s;he traver&s;ed the
Chamber in great &s;eeming Irre&s;olution, often
&s;tealing a Glance to the Letter, which &s;he had
a &s;trong Inclination to open; but, &s;earching
the Records of her Memory for a Precedent,
and not finding, that any Lady ever opened a
Letter from an unknown Lover, &s;he reiterated
her Commands to <HI>Lucy</HI> to carry it back, with
a Look and Accent &s;o very &s;evere, that the Girl,
extremely apprehen&s;ive of having offended her,
put the Letter again in her Pocket, re&s;olving
to return it the fir&s;t Opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="31">
Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> who had his Thoughts wholly
taken up with the flattering Pro&s;pect of Suc|ce&s;s,
no &s;ooner &s;aw <HI>Lucy,</HI> who gave him his
Letter without &s;peaking a Word, than, &s;up|po&s;ing
it had been the An&s;wer he expected, he
eagerly &s;natched it out of her Hand, and,
ki&s;&s;ing it fir&s;t in a Rapture of Joy, broke it
open; but his Surprize and Confu&s;ion, when
he &s;aw it was his own Letter returned, was
inexpre&s;&s;ible. For &s;ome Moments he kept
his Eyes fa&s;tened upon the tender Billet, as if
he was really reading it. His Di&s;appointment,
and the ridiculous Figure he knew he mu&s;t
make in the Eyes of his Me&s;&s;enger, filled him
with &s;o much Confu&s;ion, that he did not dare
to look up; but, recovering him&s;elf at la&s;t,
he affected to turn it into a Je&s;t; and, laugh|ing
fir&s;t him&s;elf, gave <HI>Lucy</HI> the Liberty of
laughing al&s;o, who had with much Difficulty
been able to prevent doing it before.</P>
<P>The Curio&s;ity he felt to hear how &s;he had
acquitted her&s;elf of the Tru&s;t he had repo&s;ed
in her, made him oblige her to give a Truce
to her Mirth, in order to &s;atisfy him; and
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who was extremely exact in her Re|lations,
told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed, without
omitting the &s;malle&s;t Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Though it was impo&s;&s;ible to draw any
favourable Omen from what he heard, yet he
determined to make another Effort, before he
&s;et out for <HI>London;</HI> and, taking Leave of his
Confident, after he had appointed her to meet
him again the next Day, at her Brother's, he
went home to con&s;ider upon Means to effect
<PB N="16" REF="32">
his De&s;igns, which the ill Succe&s;s of his fir&s;t
Attempt had not forced him to abandon.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who expected to hear, that the
Return of his Letter would make her Lover
commit &s;ome very extravagant Actions; and
having impatiently waited for an Account of
them from <HI>Lucy;</HI> finding &s;he &s;eemed to
have no Intention to begin a Di&s;cour&s;e con|cerning
him; a&s;ked her, at la&s;t, If &s;he had
executed her Commi&s;&s;ion, and returned the
Letter to the in&s;olent Unknown?</P>
<P>The Girl an&s;wered, Yes.</P>
<P>Which not being all that her Lady expected,
And how did he receive it? re&s;umed &s;he,
peevi&s;hly.</P>
<P>Why Madam, replied <HI>Lucy,</HI> I believe he
thought your Lady&s;hip had &s;ent him an An|&s;wer;
for he ki&s;&s;ed the Letter &s;everal times.</P>
<P>Fooli&s;h Wench! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> How can
you imagine he had the Temerity to think I
&s;hould an&s;wer his Letter? A Favour, which,
though he had &s;pent Years in my Service,
would have been infinitely greater than he
could have expected. No, <HI>Lucy,</HI> he ki&s;&s;ed
the Letter, either becau&s;e he thought it had been
touched at lea&s;t by my Hands, or to &s;hew the
perfect Submi&s;&s;ion with which he received my
Commands; and it is not to be doubted, but
his De&s;pair will force him to commit &s;ome
de&s;perate Outrage again&s;t him&s;elf, which I do
not hate him enough to wi&s;h, though he has
mortally offended me.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great Sen&s;ibility
and Softne&s;s; and, being really per&s;uaded, that
her Lover would entertain &s;ome fatal De&s;ign,
<PB N="17" REF="33">
&s;eemed &s;o much affected with the Thoughts of
what might happen, that <HI>Lucy,</HI> who tenderly
loved her, begged her not to be &s;o much con|cerned
for the Gentleman: There is no Fear,
added &s;he, that he will do him&s;elf a Mi&s;chief;
for when he di&s;covered his Mi&s;take, he laughed
heartily, as well as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>How! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely &s;urpri&s;ed,
Did he laugh?</P>
<P>Which <HI>Lucy</HI> confirming, Doubtle&s;s, re|&s;umed
&s;he, having taken a little Time to con|&s;ider
of &s;o &s;trange a Phaenomenon, he laughed,
becau&s;e his Rea&s;on was di&s;turbed at the &s;udden
Shock he received: Unhappy Man! his Pre|&s;umption
will be &s;everely enough puni&s;hed,
though I do not add Anger to the Scorn which
I have expre&s;&s;ed for him: Therefore, <HI>Lucy,</HI>
you may tell him, if you plea&s;e, that, not|with&s;tanding
the Offence he has been guilty
of, I am not cruel enough to wi&s;h his Death;

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which one would imagine the Ad|venture
concluded, but for a Promi&s;e,
that &s;omething el&s;e is to come.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>LUCY</HI> now began to think there was &s;ome|thing
more, than &s;he imagined, in this
Affair. Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI> indeed, in her Opinion,
had &s;eemed to be very far from having any
De&s;ign to attempt his own Life; but her
<PB N="18" REF="34">
Lady, &s;he thought, could not po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;|taken;
and therefore &s;he re&s;olved to carry her
Me&s;&s;age to him immediately, though it was
then late in the Evening.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he went to her Brother's,
where &s;he had &s;ome Hope of meeting with
him; but not finding him there, &s;he obliged
him to go to the Hou&s;e where he lived, and tell
him &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with him.</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> being let into the Secret of his
Si&s;ter's frequent Meetings with Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI>
imagined &s;he had &s;ome agreeable News to ac|quaint
him with; and therefore ran imme|diately
to his Relation's Hou&s;e, which was but
at a &s;mall Di&s;tance; but he was told Mr.
<HI>Hervey</HI> was in Bed, very much indi&s;po&s;ed, and
could not be &s;een.</P>
<P>This News put <HI>Lucy</HI> in a terrible Fright:
She told her Apprehen&s;ions to her Brother;
which being &s;uch as her Lady had put into her
Head, and were now confirmed by Mr. <HI>Her|vey</HI>'s
Illne&s;s, the young Farmer &s;tood amazed,
not being able to comprehend her Meaning;
and &s;he, without &s;taying to explain her&s;elf any
further, went home to the Ca&s;tle, and told
her Lady, That what &s;he feared was come to
pa&s;s; the Gentleman would certainly die; for
he was very ill in Bed.</P>
<P>This being no more than what <HI>Arabella</HI> ex|pected,
&s;he di&s;covered no Surprize; but only
a&s;ked <HI>Lucy,</HI> If &s;he had delivered her Me&s;&s;age
to him?</P>
<P>Would you have me, Madam, replied &s;he,
go to his Hou&s;e? I am afraid the Marquis
will hear of it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="35">
My Father, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> can never be
offended with me for doing a charitable
Action.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, interrupted <HI>Lucy,</HI> let me go
then immediately, for fear the poor Gentle|man
&s;hould grow wor&s;e.</P>
<P>If he be &s;ick almo&s;t to Death, re&s;umed <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
he will recover, if I command him to do
&s;o: When did you hear of a Lover dying
through De&s;pair, when his Mi&s;tre&s;s let him
know it was her Plea&s;ure he &s;hould live? But
as it will not be altogether &s;o proper for you to
go to his Hou&s;e, as it may be &s;u&s;pected you
come from me; I'll write a few Lines, which
you &s;hall copy, and your Brother may carry
them to him To-morrow, and I'll engage he
&s;hall be well in a few Hours.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he went into her Clo&s;et, and,
having written a &s;hort Note, made <HI>Lucy</HI> write
it over again. It was as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>This Letter <HI>Lucy</HI> copied, and <HI>Arabella,</HI> ex|amining

was di&s;patched by <HI>Lucy</HI> to her Brother, in|clo&s;ed
in one to him, charging him to carry it
to the &s;ick Gentleman immediately.</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> having a &s;trong Curio&s;ity to &s;ee
what his Si&s;ter had written, ventured to open it;
and, not being able to imagine Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had
really given her Orders to write what appeared
to him the mo&s;t unintelligible Stuff in the
World, re&s;olved to &s;uppre&s;s this Letter till he
had que&s;tioned her a little concerning it.</P>
<P>A few Hours after, Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> who ex|pected
to meet <HI>Lucy</HI> at her Brother's, came in.
His Illne&s;s having been only a violent Head|ach,
to which he was &s;ubject, being now quite
off, he remembred the Appointment he had
made; but, having waited &s;ome time, and
&s;he not coming, he returned again to his
<PB N="21" REF="37">
Cou&s;in's, leaving word for her, that he would
&s;ee her the next Day.</P>
<P>Scarce was he gone out, when <HI>Lucy,</HI> who
longed to know what Effect her Letter had
produced in his Health, came in; and eagerly
inquiring of her Brother how Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI> was,
received for An&s;wer, that he had been there
a Moment before &s;he came.</P>
<P>Well, cried &s;he, cla&s;ping her Hands to|gether,
with Surprize, my Lady &s;aid, her Letter
would cure him, if he was ever &s;o &s;ick; but I
did not imagine he would have been well
enough to come abroad &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>Your Lady! interrupted <HI>William,</HI> why was
it not your&s;elf that wrote that Letter you gave
to me?</P>
<P>No, truly, Brother, re&s;umed &s;he: How
was it po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould write &s;o fine a Letter?
My Lady <HI>made</HI> every Word of it, and I only
wrote it after her.</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> hearing this, would not own the
Indi&s;cretion he now thought he had been
guilty of, in keeping the Letter; but &s;uffered his
Si&s;ter to return to her Lady, in the Belief that
he had delivered it, re&s;olving, when he &s;aw
her next, to &s;ay he had lo&s;t it; for he knew
not what Excu&s;e to make to Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI> for
not giving it him when he &s;aw him.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> received the Account of her Lover's
Recovery as a Thing &s;he was ab&s;olutely &s;ure
of before; and thinking &s;he had now done all
that could be expected from her Compa&s;&s;ion,
re&s;umed her u&s;ual Severity, and commanded
<HI>Lucy</HI> to mention him no more. If he loves
me with that Purity he ought to do, pur&s;ued
<PB N="22" REF="38">
&s;he, he will cea&s;e to importune me any further:
And though his Pa&s;&s;ion be ever &s;o violent, his
Re&s;pect and Submi&s;&s;ion to my Commands will
oblige him to Silence. The Obedience he
has already &s;hewn, in recovering at the fir&s;t
Intimation I gave, that it was my Will he
&s;hould do &s;o, convinces me, I need not ap|prehend
he will renew his Follies to di&s;plea&s;e
me.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> who found by this Di&s;cour&s;e of her
Lady's, that her Commi&s;&s;ion was at an End
with regard to Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> followed her Di|rections
&s;o exactly, that &s;he not only &s;poke no
more of him to her, but al&s;o, in order to avoid
him, neglected to go to her Brother's.</P>
<P>His Impatience at not &s;eeing her made him
prevail upon her Brother to go the Ca&s;tle, and
intreat her to give him another Interview: But
<HI>Lucy</HI> po&s;itively refu&s;ed; and, to make a Merit
with her Lady of her Obedience, informed
her what he had reque&s;ted.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> re&s;enting a Boldne&s;s which argued
&s;o little Re&s;pect to her Commands, began
now to repent of the Compa&s;&s;ion &s;he had
&s;hewn him; and, commending <HI>Lucy</HI> for what
&s;he had done, bid her tell the in&s;olent Un|known,
if he ever &s;ent to her again, that &s;he
was re&s;olved never to pardon the Contempt
he had &s;hewn for her Orders.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> finding him&s;elf de&s;erted by
<HI>Lucy,</HI> re&s;olved to give over his Attempts, con|gratulating
him&s;elf for his Di&s;cretion in not
acquainting his Cou&s;in with what he had al|ready
done: His Heart not being very much
engaged, he found no great Difficulty in con|&s;oling
<PB N="23" REF="39">
him&s;elf for his bad Succe&s;s. In a few
Days he thought of Lady <HI>Bella</HI> no more, than
if he had never &s;een her; but an Accident
bringing her again in his Way, he could not
re&s;i&s;t the Inclination he felt to &s;peak to her;
and by that means drew upon him&s;elf a very
&s;en&s;ible Mortification.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Adventure is really concluded;
tho', po&s;&s;ibly, not as the Reader expected.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Marquis &s;ometimes permitting his
Daughter to ride out, and this being
the only Diver&s;ion &s;he was allowed, or ever ex|perienced,
&s;he did not fail to take it as often as
&s;he could.</P>
<P>She was returning from one of the&s;e Airings
one Day, attended by two Servants, when
Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> who happened to be at &s;ome Di|&s;tance,
ob&s;erving a Lady on Hor&s;eback, who
made a very graceful Figure, he rode up to
her, in order to have a nearer View; and,
knowing Lady <HI>Bella</HI> again, re&s;olved to &s;peak
to her: But while he was con&s;idering how he
&s;hould acco&s;t her, <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;uddenly &s;eeing him,
and ob&s;erving he was making up to her, her
Imagination immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to her, that
this in&s;olent Lover had a De&s;ign to &s;eize her
Per&s;on; and this Thought terrifying her ex|tremely,
&s;he gave a loud Shriek; which Mr.
<HI>Hervey</HI> hearing, rode eagerly up to her to in|quire
<PB N="24" REF="40">
the Rea&s;on of it, at the &s;ame time that
her two Attendants, as much amazed as him|&s;elf,
came galloping up al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> upon his coming clo&s;e to her, re|doubled
her Cries. If you have any Valour,
&s;aid &s;he to her Servants, defend your unfortu|nate
Mi&s;tre&s;s, and re&s;cue her from this unwor|thy
Man.</P>
<P>The Servants, believing him to be a High|wayman,
by this Exclamation, and dreading
le&s;t he &s;hould pre&s;ent his Pi&s;tol at their Heads,
if they offered to make any Re&s;i&s;tance, recoiled
a few Paces back, expecting he would demand
their Pur&s;es when he had robbed their Lady:
But the extreme Surprize he was in, keeping
him motionle&s;s, the Fellows not &s;eeing any
Pi&s;tols in his Hand, and animated by <HI>Arabella</HI>'s
Cries, who, calling them Cowards and Trai|tors,
urged them to deliver her; they both, in
a Moment, laid hold of Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> and forced
him to alight; which they did al&s;o them&s;elves,
&s;till keeping fa&s;t hold of him, whom Surprize,
Shame, and Rage, had hitherto kept &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Ra&s;cals! cried he, when he was able to
&s;peak, what do you mean by u&s;ing me in this
manner? Do you &s;uppo&s;e I had any Intention
to hurt the Lady?&mdash;What do you take me
for?</P>
<P>For a Villain, for a Ravi&s;her, interrupted
<HI>Arabella,</HI> who, contrary to all Laws both hu|man
and divine, endeavour to po&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elf
by Force of a Per&s;on whom your are not worthy
to &s;erve; and who&s;e Charity and Compa&s;&s;ion
you have returned with the utmo&s;t Ingratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="41">
Upon my Word, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI>
I don't under&s;tand one Word you &s;ay: You
either mi&s;take me for &s;ome other Per&s;on, or are
plea&s;ed to divert your&s;elf with the Surprize I am
in: But I be&s;eech you carry the Je&s;t no farther,
and order your Servants to let me go; or, by
Heaven&mdash;cried he &s;truggling to get loo&s;e, if I
can but free one of my Hands, I'll &s;tab the
Scoundrels before your Face.</P>
<P>It is not with Threats like the&s;e, re&s;umed
<HI>Arabella</HI> with great Calmne&s;s, that I can be
moved. A little more Submi&s;&s;ion and Re&s;pect
would become you better; you are now wholly
in my Power; I may, if I plea&s;e, carry you to
my Father, and have you &s;everely puni&s;hed for
your Attempt: But to &s;hew you, that I am as
generous as you are ba&s;e and de&s;igning, I'll give
you Freedom, provided you promi&s;e me never
to appear before me again: But, in order to &s;e|cure
my own Safety, you mu&s;t deliver up your
Arms to my Servants, that I may be a&s;&s;ured you
will not have it in your Power to make a &s;econd
Attempt upon my Liberty.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> who&s;e A&s;toni&s;hment was in|crea&s;ed
by every Word &s;he &s;poke, began now to
be apprehen&s;ive, that this might prove a very
&s;erious Affair, &s;ince &s;he &s;eemed re&s;olved to be|lieve
he had a De&s;ign to carry her off; and,
knowing that an Attempt of that Nature upon
an Heire&s;s might have dangerous Con&s;equences,
he re&s;olved to accept the Conditions &s;he offered
him: But while he delivered his Hanger to the
Servant, he a&s;&s;ured her in the &s;tronge&s;t Terms,
that he had no other De&s;ign in riding up to her,
but to have a nearer View of her Per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="42">
Add not Fal&s;hood, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;ternly, to a
Crime already black enough; for tho', by an
Effect of my Genero&s;ity, I have re&s;olved not to
deliver you up to the Re&s;entment of my Father,
yet nothing &s;hall ever be able to make me par|don
this Outrage. Go then, pur&s;ued &s;he, go,
ba&s;e Man, unworthy of the Care I took of thy
Safety; go to &s;ome di&s;tant Country, where I
may never hear of thee more; and &s;uffer me, if
po&s;&s;ible, to lo&s;e the Remembrance of thy
Crimes,</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he ordered her Servants, who
had got the Hanger in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to &s;et
him at Liberty, and mount their Hor&s;es; which
they did immediately, and followed their Lady,
who rode with all imaginable Speed to the
Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> not yet recovered from his Sur|prize,
&s;tood &s;ome Moments con&s;idering the
&s;trange Scene he had been Witne&s;s to; and in
which he had, much again&s;t his Will, appeared
the principal Character. As he was not ac|quainted
with Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s Foible, he concluded
her Fears of him were occa&s;ioned by her Sim|plicity,
and &s;ome Mi&s;repre&s;entations that had
been made her by <HI>Lucy,</HI> who, he thought, had
betrayed him; and, fearing this ridiculous
Adventure would be &s;oon made public, and him|&s;elf
expo&s;ed to the Sneers of his Country Ac|quaintance,
he re&s;olved to go back to <HI>London</HI> as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The next Day, pretending he had received a
Letter which obliged him to &s;et out immedi|ately,
he took Leave of his Cou&s;in, heartily
glad at the E&s;cape he &s;hould make from his Rail|lery;
<PB N="27" REF="43">
for he did not doubt but the Story would
very &s;oon be known, and told greatly to his Di&s;|advantage.</P>
<P>But <HI>Arabella,</HI> in order to be completely ge|nerous,
a Quality for which all the Heroines
are famous, laid a Command upon her two At|tendants
not to mention what had pa&s;&s;ed, giv|ing
them, at the &s;ame time, Money to &s;ecure
their Secrecy; and threatening them with her
Di&s;plea&s;ure, if they di&s;obeyed.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he had an Opportunity,
did not fail to acquaint her faithful <HI>Lucy</HI> with
the Danger from which &s;he had &s;o happily
e&s;caped, thanking Heaven at the &s;ame time
with great Devotion, for having pre&s;erved her
from the Hands of the Ravi&s;her.</P>
<P>Two or three Months rolled away, after this
Accident, without offering any new Adventure
to our fair Vi&s;ionary; when her Imagination,
always prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame fanta&s;tic Ideas,

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which &s;ome Contradictions are very hap|pily
reconciled.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Marquis's head Gardener had received
a young Fellow into his Ma&s;ter's Service,
who had lived in &s;everal Families of Di&s;tinction.
He had a good Face; was tolerably genteel;
and, having an Under&s;tanding &s;omething above
his Condition, join'd to a great deal of <HI>&s;econd|hand</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="44">
Politene&s;s, which he had contracted while
he lived at <HI>London,</HI> he appeared a very extraor|dinary
Per&s;on among the Ru&s;tics who were his
Fellow-Servants.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> when &s;he walked in the Garden,
had frequent Opportunities of &s;eeing this young
Man, whom &s;he ob&s;erved with a very particular
Attention. His Per&s;on and Air had &s;omething,
&s;he thought, very di&s;tingui&s;hing. When &s;he
conde&s;cended to &s;peak to him about any Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
he was employed in, &s;he took Notice, that
his An&s;wers were framed in a Language va&s;tly
&s;uperior to his Condition; and the Re&s;pect he
paid her had quite another Air from that of
the aukward Civility of the other Servants.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cerned &s;o many Marks of a Birth
far from being mean, &s;he ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed from an
Opinion that he was a Gentleman, to a Belief
that he was &s;omething more; and every new
Sight of him adding Strength to her Su&s;picions,
&s;he remained, in a little time, perfectly con|vinced
that he was &s;ome Per&s;on of Quality, who,
di&s;gui&s;ed in the Habit of a Gardener, had intro|duced
him&s;elf into her Father's Service, in or|der
to have an Opportunity of declaring a Pa&s;|&s;ion
to her, which mu&s;t certainly be very great,
&s;ince it had forced him to a&s;&s;ume an Appearance
&s;o unworthy of his noble Extraction.</P>
<P>Wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this Thought, &s;he &s;et
her&s;elf to ob&s;erve him more narrowly; and &s;oon
found out, that he went very aukwardly about
his Work; that he &s;ought Opportunities of be|ing
alone; that he threw him&s;elf in her Way
as often as he could, and gazed on her very at|tentively:
She &s;ometimes fan&s;ied &s;he &s;aw him
<PB N="29" REF="45">
endeavour to &s;mother a Sigh when he an&s;wered
her any Que&s;tion about his Work; once &s;aw
him leaning again&s;t a Tree with his Hands
cro&s;&s;ed upon his Brea&s;t; and, having lo&s;t a
String of &s;mall Pearls, which &s;he remembered
he had &s;een her threading as &s;he &s;at in one of the
Arbours, was per&s;uaded he had taken it up,
and kept it for the Object of his &s;ecret Adora|tion.</P>
<P>She often wondered, indeed, that &s;he did not
find her Name carved on the Trees, with &s;ome
my&s;terious Expre&s;&s;ions of Love; that he was
never di&s;covered lying along the Side of one of
the little Rivulets, increa&s;ing the Stream with his
Tears; nor, for three Months that he had lived
there, had ever been &s;ick of a Fever cau&s;ed by
his Grief, and the Con&s;traint he put upon him&s;elf
in not declaring his Pa&s;&s;ion: But &s;he con&s;idered
again, that his Fear of being di&s;covered kept
him from amu&s;ing him&s;elf with making the
Trees bear the Records of his &s;ecret Thoughts,
or of indulging his Melancholy in any Manner
expre&s;&s;ive of the Condition of his Soul; and, as
for his not being &s;ick, his Youth, and the
Strength of his Con&s;titution, might, even for a
longer time, bear him up again&s;t the A&s;&s;aults of
a Fever: But he appeared much thinner and
paler than he u&s;ed to be; and &s;he concluded,
therefore, that he mu&s;t in time &s;ink under the
Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion, or el&s;e be forced to de|clare
it to her; which &s;he con&s;idered as a very
great Misfortune; for, not finding in her&s;elf
any Di&s;po&s;ition to approve his Love, &s;he mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
bani&s;h him from her Pre&s;ence, for fear
he &s;hould have the Pre&s;umption to hope, that
<PB N="30" REF="46">
Time might do any thing in his Favour: And
it was po&s;&s;ible al&s;o, that the Sentence &s;he would
be obliged to pronounce, might either cau&s;e his
Death, or force him to commit &s;ome extrava|gant
Action, which would di&s;cover him to her
Father, who would, perhaps, think her guilty
of holding a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with him.</P>
<P>The&s;e Thoughts perplexed her &s;o much, that,
hoping to find &s;ome Relief by unburdening her
Mind to <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;he told her all her Unea&s;ine&s;s.
Ah! &s;aid &s;he to her, looking upon <HI>Edward,</HI>
who had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed them, how unfortunate do
I think my&s;elf in being the Cau&s;e of that Pa&s;&s;ion
which makes this illu&s;trious Unknown wear
away his Days in &s;o &s;hameful an Ob&s;curity!
Yes, <HI>Lucy,</HI> pur&s;ued &s;he, that <HI>Edward,</HI> whom
you regard as one of my Father's menial Ser|vants,
is a Per&s;on of <HI>&s;ublime Quality,</HI> who &s;ub|mits
to this Di&s;gui&s;e only to have an Opportu|nity
of &s;eeing me every Day. But why do you
&s;eem &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that you have
not &s;u&s;pected him to be what he is? Has he ne|ver
unwittingly made any Di&s;covery of him&s;elf?
Have you not &s;urpri&s;ed him in Di&s;cour&s;e with
his faithful 'Squire, who, certainly, lurks here|abouts
to receive his Commands, and is haply
the Confident of his Pa&s;&s;ion? Has he never en|tertained
you with any Conver&s;ation about me?
Or have you never &s;een any valuable Jewels
in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by which you &s;u&s;pected him to
be not what he appears?</P>
<P>Truly, Madam, replied <HI>Lucy,</HI> I never took
him for any body el&s;e but a &s;imple Gardener;
but now you open my Eyes, methinks I can
find I have been &s;trangely mi&s;taken; for he does
<PB N="31" REF="47">
not look like a Man of low Degree; and he
talks quite in another Manner from our Ser|vants.
I never heard him indeed &s;peak of your
Lady&s;hip, but once; and that was, when he
fir&s;t &s;aw you walking in the Garden, he a&s;ked
our <HI>John,</HI> If you was not the Marquis's Daugh|ter?
And he &s;aid, You was as beautiful as an
Angel. As for &s;ine Jewels, I never &s;aw any;
and I believe he has none; but he has a Watch,
and that looks as if he was &s;omething, Madam:
Nor do I remember to have &s;een him talk with
any Stranger that looked like a 'Squire.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> having thus, with her u&s;ual Punctuality,
an&s;wered every Que&s;tion her Lady put to her,
proceeded to a&s;k her, What &s;he &s;hould &s;ay, if
he &s;hould beg her to give her a Letter, as the
other Gentleman had done?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t by no means take it, replied <HI>Ara|bella:</HI>
My Compa&s;&s;ion had before like to have
been fatal to me. If he di&s;covers his Quality to
me, I &s;hall know in what manner to treat him.</P>
<P>They were in this Part of their Di&s;cour&s;e,
when a Noi&s;e they heard at &s;ome Di&s;tance,
made <HI>Arabella</HI> bend her Steps to the Place from
whence it proceeded; and, to her infinite Amaze|ment,
&s;aw the head Gardener, with a Stick he
had in his Hand, give &s;everal Blows to the con|cealed
Hero, who &s;uffered the Indignity with
admirable Patience.</P>
<P>Shocked at &s;eeing a Per&s;on of Quality treated
&s;o unworthily, &s;he called out to the Gardener
to hold his Hand; who immediately obeyed;
and <HI>Edward,</HI> &s;eeing the young Lady advance,
&s;neaked off, with an Air very different from an
<HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="48">
For what Crime, pray, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> with
a &s;tern A&s;pect, did you treat the Per&s;on I &s;aw
with you &s;o cruelly? He whom you take &s;uch
unbecoming Liberties with, may po&s;&s;ibly&mdash;But
again I a&s;k you, What has he done? You
&s;hould make &s;ome Allowance for his want of
Skill in the abject Employment he is in at
pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It is not for his want of Skill, Madam, &s;aid the
Gardener, that I corrected him; he knows his
Bu&s;ine&s;s very well, if he would mind it; but,
Madam, I have di&s;covered him&mdash;</P>
<P>Di&s;covered him, do you &s;ay? interrupted
<HI>Arabella:</HI> And has the Knowledge of his Con|dition
not been able to prevent &s;uch U&s;age? or
rather, Has it been the Occa&s;ion of his receiv|ing
it?</P>
<P>His Conditions are very bad, Madam, re|turned
the Gardener; and I am afraid are &s;uch
as will one Day prove the Ruin of Body and
Soul too. I have for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pected he
had bad De&s;igns in his Head; and ju&s;t now
watched him to the Fi&s;h-pond, and prevented
him from&mdash;</P>
<P>O dear! interrupted <HI>Lucy,</HI> looking pitifully
on her Lady, who&s;e fair Bo&s;om heaved with
Compa&s;&s;ion, I warrant he was going to make
away with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>No, re&s;umed the Gardener, &s;miling at the
Mi&s;take, he was only going to make away with
&s;ome of the Carp, which the Rogue had
caught, and intended, I &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;ell; but
I threw them into the Water again; and if
your Lady&s;hip had not forbid me, I would have
drubbed him &s;oundly for his Pains.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="49">
Fye! fye! interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> out of Breath
with Shame and Vexation, tell me no more of
the&s;e idle Tales.</P>
<P>Then, ha&s;tily walking on to hide the Blu&s;hes
which this &s;trange Accu&s;ation of her illu&s;trious
Lover had rai&s;ed in her Face, &s;he continued for
&s;ome time in the greate&s;t Perplexity ima|ginable.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> who followed her, and could not
po&s;&s;ibly reconcile what her Lady had been telling
her concerning <HI>Edward,</HI> with the Circum&s;tance
of his &s;tealing the Carp, ardently wi&s;hed to hear
her Opinion of this Matter; but, &s;eeing her
deeply engaged with her own Thoughts, &s;he
would not venture to di&s;turb her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> indeed, had been in &s;uch a terrible
Con&s;ternation, that it was &s;ome Time before
&s;he even reconciled Appearances to her&s;elf; but,
as &s;he had a mo&s;t happy Faculty in accommo|dating
every Incident to her own Wi&s;hes and
Conceptions, &s;he examined this Matter &s;o many
different Ways, drew &s;o many Conclu&s;ions, and
fan&s;ied &s;o many My&s;teries in the mo&s;t indif|ferent
Actions of the &s;uppo&s;ed noble Unknown,
that &s;he remained, at la&s;t, more than ever
confirmed in the Opinion, that he was &s;ome
great Per&s;onage, whom her Beauty had forced
to a&s;&s;ume an Appearance unworthy of him&s;elf:
When <HI>Lucy,</HI> no longer able to keep Silence,
drew off her Attention from tho&s;e plea&s;ing
Images, by &s;peaking of the Carp-&s;tealing Affair
again.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who&s;e Confu&s;ion returned at that
di&s;agreeable Sound, charged her, in an angry
Tone, never to mention &s;o injurious a Su&s;pi|cion
<PB N="34" REF="50">
any more: For, in fine, &s;aid &s;he to her,
do you imagine a Per&s;on of his Rank could be
guilty of &s;tealing Carp? Alas! pur&s;ued &s;he,
&s;ighing, he had, indeed, &s;ome fatal De&s;ign;
and, doubtle&s;s, would have executed it, had not
this Fellow &s;o luckily prevented him.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Woodbind,</HI> Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;aw
the Carp in his Hand: I wonder what he was
going to do with them.</P>
<P>Still, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> extremely chagrined,
&s;till will you wound my Ears with that horrid
Sound? I tell you, ob&s;tinate and fooli&s;h Wench,
that this unhappy Man went thither to die; and
if he really caught the Fi&s;h, it was to conceal
his De&s;ign from <HI>Woodbind:</HI> His great Mind
could not &s;ugge&s;t to him, that it was po&s;&s;ible he
might be &s;u&s;pected of a Ba&s;ene&s;s like that this
ignorant Fellow accu&s;ed him of; therefore he
took no Care about it, being wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by his de&s;pairing Thoughts.</P>
<P>However, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> your Lady|&s;hip
may prevent his going to the Fi&s;hpond again,
by laying your Commands upon him to live.</P>
<P>I &s;hall do all that I ought, an&s;wered <HI>Arabella;</HI>
but my Care for the Safety of other Per&s;ons mu&s;t
not make me forget what I owe to my own.</P>
<P>As &s;he had always imputed Mr. <HI>Hervey</HI>'s fan|&s;ied
Attempt to carry her away, to the Letter
&s;he had written to him, upon which he had pro|bably
founded his Hopes of being pardoned for
it, &s;he re&s;olved to be more cautious for the fu|ture
in giving &s;uch In&s;tances of her Compa&s;&s;ion;
and was at a great Lo&s;s in what manner to com|fort
her de&s;pairing Lover, without rai&s;ing Ex|pectations
&s;he had no Inclination to confirm:
<PB N="35" REF="51">
But &s;he was delivered from her Perplexity by
the News of his having left the Marquis's Ser|vice;

always thought as her Lady did, was of the
&s;ame Opinion; tho' it was talked among the

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which a Mi&s;take, in point of Ceremony,
is rectified.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> had &s;carce done thinking of
this la&s;t Adventure, when the Marquis
communicated a Piece of Intelligence to her,
which opened a Pro&s;pect of an infinite Number
of new ones.</P>
<P>His Nephew, having ju&s;t returned from his
Travels, was preparing to come and pay him a
Vi&s;it in his Retreat; and, as he always de&s;igned
to marry <HI>Arabella</HI> to this Youth, of whom he
was extremely fond, he told his Daughter of
the intended Vi&s;it of her Cou&s;in, whom &s;he had
not &s;een &s;ince &s;he was eight Years old; and,
for the fir&s;t time, in&s;inuated his De&s;ign of giving
him to her for an Hu&s;band.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who&s;e Delicacy was extremely
&s;hocked at this abrupt Declaration of her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">a|ther,
could hardly hide her Chagrin; for,
<PB N="36" REF="52">
tho' &s;he always intended to marry &s;ome time or
other, as all the Heroines had done, yet &s;he
thought &s;uch an Event ought to be brought about
with an infinite deal of Trouble; and that it
was nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould pa&s;s to this State thro'
a great Number of Cares, Di&s;appointments, and
Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of various Kinds, like them; that her
Lover &s;hould purcha&s;e her with his Sword from
a Croud of Rivals; and arrive to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of her Heart by many Years of Services and Fi|delity.</P>
<P>The Impropriety of receiving a Lover of a
Father's recommending appeared in its &s;tronge&s;t
Light. What Lady in Romance ever married
the Man that was cho&s;e for her? In tho&s;e Ca&s;es
the Remon&s;trances of a Parent are called Per&s;e|cutions;
ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance, Con&s;tancy and
Courage; and an Aptitude to di&s;like the Per|&s;on
propo&s;ed to them, a noble Freedom of Mind
which di&s;dains to love or hate by the Caprice of
others.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;trengthening her own Re&s;olutions
by tho&s;e Examples of heroic Di&s;obedience, told
her Father, with great Solemnity of Accent,
that &s;he would always obey him in all ju&s;t and
rea&s;onable Things; and, being per&s;uaded that
he would never attempt to lay any Force upon
her Inclinations, &s;he would endeavour to make
them conformable to his, and receive her Cou|&s;in
with that Civility and Friend&s;hip due to &s;o
near a Relation, and a Per&s;on whom he honoured
with his E&s;teem.</P>
<P>The Marquis, having had frequent Occa&s;ions
of admiring his Daughter's Eloquence, did not
draw any unplea&s;ing Conclu&s;ion from the nice
<PB N="37" REF="53">
Di&s;tinctions &s;he made; and, being perfectly a&s;|&s;ured
of her Con&s;ent whenever he demanded it,
expected the Arrival of his Nephew with great
Impatience.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who&s;e Thoughts had been fully
employed &s;ince this Conver&s;ation with her Fa|ther,
was indulging her Meditations in one of
the mo&s;t retired Walks in the Garden; when
&s;he was informed by <HI>Lucy,</HI> that her Cou&s;in was
come, and that the Marquis had brought him
into the Garden to look for her.</P>
<P>That In&s;tant they both entered the Walk,
when <HI>Arabella,</HI> prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as &s;he was, again&s;t
any favourable Thoughts of the young <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
could not help betraying &s;ome Surprize at
the Gracefulne&s;s of his Figure.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;aid &s;he to her Attendant,
with a Smile, that this Lover my Father has
brought us, is no contemptible Per&s;on: Never|thele&s;s
I feel an invincible Repugnance in my&s;elf
again&s;t receiving him in that Character.</P>
<P>As &s;he fini&s;hed the&s;e Words, the Marquis
came up, and pre&s;ented Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to her;
who, &s;aluting her with the Freedom of a Rela|tion,
gave her a Di&s;gu&s;t that &s;hewed it&s;elf imme|diately
in her fair Face, which was over&s;pread
with &s;uch a Gloom, that the Marquis was quite
a&s;toni&s;hed at it. Indeed <HI>Arabella,</HI> who expected
he would hardly have pre&s;umed to ki&s;s her Hand,
was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at his Freedom, in attempting
her Lips, that &s;he not only expre&s;&s;ed her Indig|nation
by Frowns, but gave him to under&s;tand
he had mortally offended her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> however, was neither &s;urpri&s;ed
nor angry at her Re&s;entment; but, imputing it
<PB N="38" REF="54">
to her Country Education, endeavoured to railly
her out of her ill Humour; and the Marquis, be|ing
glad to find a Behaviour, which he thought
proceeded from her Di&s;like of her Cou&s;in, was
only an Effect of an over-&s;crupulous Mode&s;ty,
told her that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had committed no
Offence by &s;aluting her, &s;ince that was a Civi|lity
which was granted to all Strangers at the
fir&s;t Interview, and therefore could not be re|fu&s;ed
to a Relation.</P>
<P>Since the World is &s;o degenerate in it's Cu&s;|toms
from what it was formerly, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
with a Smile full of Contempt upon her Cou&s;in,
I am extremely happy in having lived in a Soli|tude
which has not yet expo&s;ed me to the Mor|tification
of being a Witne&s;s to Manners I can|not
approve; for if every Per&s;on I &s;hall meet
with for the future be &s;o deficient in their Re|&s;pects
to Ladies, as my Cou&s;in is, I &s;hall not care
how much I am &s;ecluded from Society.</P>
<P>But, dear Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> interrupted Mr. <HI>Glan|ville</HI>
gaily, tell me, I be&s;eech you, how I mu&s;t
behave to plea&s;e you; for I &s;hould be extremely
glad to be honoured with your good Opinion.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on, re&s;umed &s;he, whom I mu&s;t
teach how to acquire my good Opinion, will,
I am afraid, hardly recompen&s;e me by his Do|cility
in learning, for the Pains I &s;hould be at in
in&s;tructing him.</P>
<P>But, re&s;umed <HI>Glanville,</HI> that I may avoid any
more Occa&s;ions of offending you, only let me
know how you would be approached for the fu|ture.</P>
<P>Since, an&s;wered &s;he, there is no Nece&s;&s;ity to
renew the Ceremony of introducing you again
<PB N="39" REF="55">
to me, I have not a &s;econd Affront of that Kind
to apprehend; but I pray tell me, If all Cavaliers
are as pre&s;uming as your&s;elf; and if a Relation
of your Sex does not think a mode&s;t Embrace
from a Lady a Welcome &s;ufficiently tender<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Heroines, tho' they think a' Ki&s;s of the Hand a great Conde&s;cention to a Lover, and never grant it without Blu&s;hes and Confu&s;ion; yet make no Scruple to embrace him upon every &s;hort Ab&s;ence.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>Nay, Cou&s;in, cried <HI>Glanville</HI> eagerly, I am
now per&s;uaded you are in the Right; an Em|brace
is certainly to be preferred to a cold Sa|lute.
What would I give, that the Marquis
would introduce me a &s;econd time, that I might
be received with &s;o delightful a Welcome?</P>
<P>The Vivacity with which he &s;poke this was &s;o
extremely di&s;agreeable to <HI>Arabella,</HI> that &s;he turned
from him abruptly, and, &s;triking into another
Walk, ordered <HI>Lucy</HI> to tell him &s;he commanded
him not to follow her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> however, who had no No|tion
of the exact Obedience which was expected
from him, would have gone after her, notwith|&s;tanding
this Prohibition, which <HI>Lucy</HI> delivered
in a mo&s;t peremptory Manner, after her Lady's
Example: But the Marquis, who had left the
two young People at Liberty to di&s;cour&s;e, and
had walked on, that he might not interrupt them,
turning about, and &s;eeing <HI>Glanville</HI> alone, called
him to have &s;ome private Di&s;cour&s;e with him;
and, for that time, &s;pared <HI>Arabella</HI> the Morti|fication
of &s;eeing her Commands di&s;obeyed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which a Lover is &s;everely puni&s;hed for
Faults which the Reader never would
have di&s;covered, if he had not been told.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Marquis, tho' he had re&s;olved to give
<HI>Arabella</HI> to his Nephew, was de&s;irous he
&s;hould fir&s;t receive &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions of Tender|ne&s;s
for her, before he ab&s;olutely declared his
Re&s;olution; and ardently wi&s;hed he might be
able to overcome that Reluctance which &s;he
&s;eemed to have for Marriage: But, tho' <HI>Glanville</HI>
in a very few Days became pa&s;&s;ionately in Love
with his charming Cou&s;in, yet &s;he di&s;covered &s;o
&s;trong a Di&s;like to him, that the Marquis feared it
would be difficult to make her receive him for an
Hu&s;band: He ob&s;erved &s;he took all Opportu|nities
of avoiding his Conver&s;ation; and &s;eemed
always out of Temper when he addre&s;&s;ed any
thing to her; but was well enough plea&s;ed,
when he di&s;cour&s;ed with him; and would li&s;ten
to the long Conver&s;ations they had together with
great Attention.</P>
<P>The Truth is, &s;he had too much Di&s;cernment
not to &s;ee Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had a great deal of
Merit; his Per&s;on was perfectly hand&s;ome; he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great Share of Under&s;tanding, an
ea&s;y Temper, and a Vivacity which charmed
every one, but the in&s;en&s;ible <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>She often wondered, that a Man, who, as
&s;he told her Confident, was Ma&s;ter of &s;o many
fine Qualities, &s;hould have a Di&s;po&s;ition &s;o little
capable of feeling the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love, with the
<PB N="41" REF="57">
Delicacy and Fervour &s;he expected to in&s;pire;
or, that he, who&s;e Conver&s;ation was &s;o plea&s;ing
on every other Subject, &s;hould make &s;o poor a
Figure when he entertained her with Matters
of Gallantry. However, added &s;he, I &s;hould
be to blame to de&s;ire to be beloved by Mr. <HI>Glan|ville;</HI>
for I am per&s;uaded that Pa&s;&s;ion would
cau&s;e no Reformation in the Coar&s;ene&s;s of his
Manners to Ladies, which makes him &s;o di&s;agree|able
to me, and might po&s;&s;ibly increa&s;e my
Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Marquis, having &s;tudied his Nephew's
Looks for &s;everal Days, thought he &s;aw Incli|nation
enough in them for <HI>Arabella,</HI> to make
him receive the Knowlege of his Intention with
Joy: He, therefore, called him into his Clo&s;et,
and told him in few Words, that, if his Heart
was not pre-engaged, and his Daughter capable
of making him happy, he re&s;olved to be&s;tow
her upon him, together with all his E&s;tates.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> received this agreeable News
with the &s;tronge&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of Gratitude; a&s;|&s;uring
his Uncle, that Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> of all the
Women he had ever &s;een, was mo&s;t agreeable
to his Ta&s;te; and that he felt for her all the
Tenderne&s;s and Affection his Soul was capable
of.</P>
<P>I am glad of it, my dear Nephew, &s;aid the
Marquis, embracing him: I will allow you,
added he &s;miling, but a few Weeks to court her:
Gain her Heart as &s;oon as you can, and when
you bring me her Con&s;ent, your Marriage &s;hall
be &s;olemnized immediately.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> needed not a Repetition of &s;o
agreeable a Command: He left his Uncle's Clo|&s;et,
<PB N="42" REF="58">
with his Heart filled with the Expectation of
his approaching Happine&s;s; and, under&s;tanding
<HI>Arabella</HI> was in the Garden, he went to her
with a Re&s;olution to acquaint her with the Per|mi&s;&s;ion
her Father had given him to make his
Addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P>He found his fair Cou&s;in, as u&s;ual, accompa|nied
with her Women; and, &s;eeing that, not|with&s;tanding
his Approach, they &s;till continued
to walk with her, and impatient of the Re|&s;traint
they laid him under, I be&s;eech you, Cou|&s;in,
&s;aid he, let me have the Plea&s;ure of walk|ing
with you alone: What Nece&s;&s;ity is there for
always having &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es of our Con|ver&s;ation?
You may retire, &s;aid he, &s;peaking
to <HI>Lucy,</HI> and the other Woman; I have &s;ome|thing
to &s;ay to your Lady in private.</P>
<P>Stay, I command you, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> blu&s;hing
at an In&s;olence &s;o uncommon, and take Orders
from no one but my&s;elf.&mdash;I pray you, Sir, pur|&s;ued
&s;he frowning, What Intercour&s;e of Secrets
is there between you and me, that you expect
I &s;hould favour you with a private Conver&s;ation?
An Advantage which none of your Sex ever
boa&s;ted to have gained from me; and which,
haply, you &s;hould be the la&s;t upon whom I
&s;hould be&s;tow it.</P>
<P>You have the &s;trange&s;t Notions, an&s;wered
<HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;miling at the pretty Anger &s;he di&s;co|vered:
Certainly you may hold a private Con|ver&s;ation
with any Gentleman, without giving
Offence to Decorum; and I may plead a Right
to this Happine&s;s, above any other, &s;ince I have
the Honour to be your Relation.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="59">
It is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella</HI>
gravely, that you and I &s;hould differ in Opinion
upon this Occa&s;ion: I don't remember that ever
we agreed in any thing; and, I am apt to be|lieve,
we never &s;hall.</P>
<P>Ah! don't &s;ay &s;o, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> interrupted
lie: What a Pro&s;pect of Mi&s;ery you lay before
me! For, if we are always to be oppo&s;ite to each
other, it is nece&s;&s;ary you mu&s;t hate me as much
as I admire and love you.</P>
<P>The&s;e Words, which he accompanied with
a gentle Pre&s;&s;ure of her Hand, threw the a&s;to|ni&s;hed
<HI>Arabella</HI> into &s;uch an Exce&s;s of Anger
and Shame, that, for a few Moments, &s;he was
unable to utter a Word.</P>
<P>What a horrid Violation this, of all the
Laws of Gallantry and Re&s;pect, which decree
a Lover to &s;uffer whole Years in Silence before
he declares his Flame to the divine Object that
cau&s;es it; and then with awful Tremblings, and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Pro&s;trations at the Feet of the of|fended
Fair!</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> could hardly believe her Sen&s;es when
&s;he heard a Declaration, not only made with|out
the u&s;ual Forms, but al&s;o, that the pre&s;um|tuous
Criminal waited for her An&s;wer, without
&s;eeming to have any Apprehen&s;ion of the Pu|ni&s;hment
to which he was to be doomed; and
that, in&s;tead of deprecating her Wrath, he
looked with a &s;miling Wonder upon her Eyes,
as if he did not fear their Lightenings would
&s;trike him dead.</P>
<P>Indeed, it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for him to help &s;mi|ling,
and wondering too, at the extraordinary
Notion of <HI>Arabella;</HI> for, as &s;oon as he had pro|nounced
<PB N="44" REF="60">
tho&s;e fatal Words, &s;he &s;tarted back two
or three Steps; ca&s;t a Look at him full of the
highe&s;t Indignation; and, lifting up her fine
Eyes to Heaven, &s;eemed, in the Language of
Romance, to accu&s;e the Gods for &s;ubjecting
her to &s;o cruel an Indignity.</P>
<P>The Tumult of her Thoughts being a little
&s;ettled, &s;he turned again towards <HI>Glanville;</HI> who&s;e
Countenance expre&s;&s;ing nothing of that Confu|&s;ion
and Anxiety common to an Adorer in &s;o
critical a Circum&s;tance, her Rage returned with
greater Violence than ever.</P>
<P>If I do not expre&s;s all the Re&s;entment your In|&s;olence
has filled me with, &s;aid &s;he to him, af|fecting
more Scorn than Anger, 'tis becau&s;e I
hold you too mean for my Re&s;entment; but ne|ver
hope for my Pardon for your pre&s;umptuous
Confe&s;&s;ion of a Pa&s;&s;ion I could almo&s;t de&s;pi&s;e my|&s;elf
for in&s;piring. If it be true that you love me,
go and find your Puni&s;hment in that Ab&s;ence to
which I doom you; and never hope I will &s;uffer
a Per&s;on in my Pre&s;ence, who has affronted me
in the manner you have done.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he walked away, making a Sign
to him not to follow her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was at fir&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to
laugh at the &s;trange Manner in which &s;he re|ceived
his Expre&s;&s;ions of E&s;teem for her, found
&s;omething, &s;o extremely haughty and contemp|tuous
in the Speech &s;he had made, that he was
almo&s;t mad with Vexation.</P>
<P>As he had no Notion of his Cou&s;in's heroic
Sentiments, and had never read Romances, he
was quite ignorant of the Nature of his Offence;
and, &s;uppo&s;ing the Scorn &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed for
<PB N="45" REF="61">
him was founded upon the Difference of their
Rank and Fortune, his Pride was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly
mortified at that Thought, and at her &s;o in&s;o|lently
forbiding him her Pre&s;ence, that he was
once inclined to &s;hew his Re&s;entment of &s;uch un|genteel
U&s;age, by quitting the Ca&s;tle without
taking Leave even of the Marquis, who, he
thought, could not be ignorant of the Recep|tion
he was likely to meet with from his Daugh|ter;
and ought to have guarded him again&s;t it,
if he really meant him &s;o well as he &s;eemed to
do.</P>
<P>As he was extremely violent and ha&s;ty in his
Re&s;olutions, and nicely &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t Af|front,
he was not in a Condition to rea&s;on ju&s;tly
upon the Marquis's Conduct in this Affair; and
while he was fluctuating with a thou&s;and differ|ent
Re&s;olutions, <HI>Lucy</HI> came to him with a Bil|let
from her Lady, which &s;he delivered without
&s;taying till he opened it; and was &s;uper&s;cribed

<P>The Super&s;cription of this Letter, and the un|common
Style of it, per&s;uaded Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
that what he had been fooli&s;h enough to re&s;ent
as an Affront, was de&s;igned as a Je&s;t, and
meant to divert him as well as her&s;elf: He exa|mined
her Behaviour again, and wondered at
his Stupidity in not di&s;covering it before. His
Re&s;entment vani&s;hing immediately, he returned
to the Hou&s;e; and went, without Ceremony,
to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Apartment, which he entered be|fore
&s;he perceived him, being in a profound
Mu&s;ing at one of the Windows: The Noi&s;e he
made, in approaching her, obliged her at la&s;t
to look up; when, &s;tarting, as if &s;he had &s;een a
Ba&s;ili&s;k, &s;he flew to her Clo&s;et, and, &s;hutting the
Door with great Violence, commanded him to
leave her Chamber immediately.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;till &s;uppo&s;ing her in Je&s;t, in|treated
her to open the Door; but, finding &s;he
continued ob&s;tinate, Well, &s;aid he, going away,
I &s;hall be revenged on you &s;ome time hence,
and make you repent the Tricks you play me
now.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> not being able to imagine any thing,
by the&s;e Words he &s;poke in Raillery, but that
he really, in the Spite and Angui&s;h of his Heart,
threatened her with executing &s;ome terrible En|terprize;
&s;he did not doubt, but he either in|tended
to carry her away; or, thinking her
Aver&s;ion to him proceeded from his having a
Rival happy enough to be e&s;teemed by her, tho&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="63">
my&s;terious Words he had uttered related to his
De&s;ign of killing him; &s;o that as &s;he knew, he
could di&s;cover no Rival to wreak his Revenge
upon, &s;he feared, that, at once to &s;atisfy that
Pa&s;&s;ion as well as his Love, he would make him|&s;elf
Ma&s;ter of her Liberty: For, in fine, &s;aid &s;he
to <HI>Lucy,</HI> to whom &s;he communicated all her
Thoughts, have I not every thing to apprehend
from a Man, who knows &s;o little how to treat
my Sex with the Re&s;pect which is our Due;
and who, after having, contrary to the timorous
Nature of that Pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;ulted me with a free
Declaration of Love, treated my Commands
with the utmo&s;t Contempt by appearing before
me again; and even threatens me with the Re|venge
he is meditating at this Moment?</P>
<P>Had Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> been pre&s;ent, and heard
the terrible Misfortunes which &s;he pre&s;aged from
the few Words he had je&s;tingly &s;poke, he would
certainly have made her quite furious, by the
Diver&s;ion her Mi&s;take would have afforded him.
But the more &s;he reflected on his Words, the
more &s;he was per&s;uaded of the terrible Purpo&s;e
of them.</P>
<P>'Twas in vain to acquaint her Father with
the Rea&s;ons &s;he had for di&s;liking his Choice: His
Re&s;olution was fixed, and if &s;he did not volun|tarily
conform to it, &s;he expo&s;ed her&s;elf to the
Attempts of a violent and unju&s;t Lover, who
would either prevail upon the Marquis to lay
a Force upon her Inclinations, or make him&s;elf
Ma&s;ter of her Per&s;on, and never cea&s;e per&s;e|cuting
her, till he had obliged her to give him
her Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="64">
Having rea&s;oned her&s;elf into a perfect Con|viction
that all the&s;e things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hap|pen,
&s;he thought it both ju&s;t and rea&s;onable to
provide for her own Security, by a &s;peedy Flight.
The Want of a Precedent, indeed, for an Action
of this Nature, held her a few Moments in Su&s;|pen&s;e;
for &s;he did not remember to have read
of any Heroine that voluntarily left her Father's
Hou&s;e, however per&s;ecuted &s;he might be; but &s;he
con&s;idered, that there was not any of the Ladies
in Romances, in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances with
her&s;elf who was without a favoured Lover, for
who&s;e &s;ake it might have been believed &s;he had
made an Elopement, which would have been
highly prejudicial to her Glory; and, as there
was no Foundation for any Su&s;picion of that
Kind in her Ca&s;e, &s;he thought there was no|thing
to hinder her from withdrawing from a ty|rannical
Exertion of parental Authority, and the
&s;ecret Machinations of a Lover, who&s;e Aim was
to take away her Liberty, either by obliging her
to marry him, or by making her a Pri&s;oner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Contains &s;everal Incidents, in which the
Reader is expected to be extremely inte|re&s;ted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> had &s;pent &s;ome Hours in her
Clo&s;et, revolving a thou&s;and different
Stratagems to e&s;cape from the Misfortune that
<PB N="49" REF="65">
threatened her, when &s;he was interrupted by
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who, after de&s;iring Admittance, informed
her, that the Marquis, having rode out to take
the Air that Evening, had fallen from his Hor&s;e
and received &s;ome Hurt; that he was gone to
Bed, and de&s;ired to &s;ee her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> hearing her Father was indi&s;po&s;ed,
ran to him, exce&s;&s;ively alarmed; and reflecting
on the Re&s;olution &s;he had ju&s;t before taken, of
leaving him, which aggravated her Concern,
&s;he came to his Bed&s;ide with her Eyes &s;wiming in
Tears. Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was &s;itting near him; but,
ri&s;ing at her Appearance to give her his Chair,
which &s;he accepted without taking any Notice
of him, he &s;tood at &s;ome Di&s;tance contem|plating
her Face, to which Sorrow had given
&s;o many Charms, that he gazed on her with an
Eagerne&s;s and Delight that could not e&s;cape her
Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively at the pa&s;&s;ionate Looks
he gave her; and, finding the Marquis's Indi&s;|po&s;ition
not con&s;iderable enough to oblige her
to a con&s;tant Attendance at his Bed-&s;ide, &s;he took
the fir&s;t Opportunity of returning to her Cham|ber;
but, as &s;he was going out, <HI>Glanville</HI> pre|&s;ented
his Hand to lead her up Stairs: Which
&s;he &s;cornfully refu&s;ing;</P>
<P>Sure, Cou&s;in, &s;aid he, a little piqued, you
are not di&s;po&s;ed to carry on your ill-natured Je&s;t
any further?</P>
<P>If you imagined I je&s;ted with you, &s;aid <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
I am rather to accu&s;e the Slowne&s;s of your
Under&s;tanding, for your per&s;i&s;ting in treating
me thus freely, than the In&s;olence I fir&s;t im|puted
it to: But, whatever is the Cau&s;e of it,
<PB N="50" REF="66">
I now tell you again, that you have extremely
offended me; and, if my Father's Illne&s;s did
not &s;et Bounds to my Re&s;entment at pre&s;ent, I
would make you know, that I would not &s;uffer
the Injury you do me, &s;o patiently.</P>
<P>Since you would have me to believe you are &s;e|rious,
replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> be plea&s;ed to let me
know what Offence it is you complain of; for
I prote&s;t I am quite at a Lo&s;s to under&s;tand
you.</P>
<P>Was it not enough, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> to af|front
me with an in&s;olent Declaration of your
Pa&s;&s;ion, but you mu&s;t al&s;o, in Contempt of my
Commands to the contrary, appear before me
again, pur&s;ue me to my Chamber, and u&s;e the
mo&s;t brutal Menaces to me?</P>
<P>Hold, pray, Madam, interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI>
and &s;uffer me to a&s;k you, If it is my Pre&s;ump|tion,
in declaring my&s;elf your Admirer, that
you are &s;o extremely offended at?</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s it is, Sir, an&s;wered <HI>Arabella;</HI> and
&s;uch a Pre&s;umption, as, without the aggravating
Circum&s;tances you have &s;ince added to it, is &s;uf|ficient
to make me always your Enemy.</P>
<P>I beg Pardon, returned Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> gravely,
for that Offence; and al&s;o, for &s;taying any
longer in a Hou&s;e, which you have, &s;o gen|teelly,
turned me out of.</P>
<P>My Pardon, Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> re&s;umed &s;he, is
not &s;o ea&s;ily gained: Time, and your Repent|ance,
may, indeed, do much towards obtaining
it.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he made a Sign to him to retire;
for he had walked up with her to her Chamber:
But, finding he did not obey her, for really he
<PB N="51" REF="67">
was quite unacquainted with the&s;e Sorts of dumb
Commands, &s;he ha&s;tily retired to her Clo&s;et, le&s;t
he &s;hould attempt to move her Pity, by any Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of De&s;pair for the cruel Bani&s;hment &s;he
had doomed him to.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;eeing &s;he had &s;hut her&s;elf up
in her Clo&s;et, left her Chamber, and retired to
his own, more confounded than ever at the Be|haviour
of his Cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Her bidding him &s;o peremptorily to leave the
Hou&s;e, would have equally per&s;uaded him of
her Ignorance and Ill-breeding, had not the Ele|gance
of her Manners, in every other re&s;pect,
proved the contrary: Nor was it po&s;&s;ible to doubt
&s;he had a great Share of Under&s;tanding; &s;ince
her Conver&s;ation, &s;ingular as &s;ome of her Sen|timents
&s;eemed to him, was far &s;uperior to mo&s;t
other Ladies. Therefore, he concluded, the
Affront he had received, proceeded from her
Di&s;dain to admit the Addre&s;&s;es of any Per&s;on,
who&s;e Quality was inferior to hers; which,
probably, was increa&s;ed to &s;ome particular Di&s;|like
&s;he had to his Per&s;on.</P>
<P>His Honour would not permit him to make
U&s;e of that Advantage her Father's Authority
could give him; and, wholly engro&s;&s;ed by his
Re&s;entment of the U&s;age he had received from
her, he re&s;olved to &s;et out for <HI>London</HI> the next
Day without &s;eeing the Marquis, from whom
he was apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome Endeavours to de|tain
him.</P>
<P>Having taken this Re&s;olution, he ordered his
Servant to have the Hor&s;es ready early in the
Morning; and, without taking any Notice of
his Intention, he left the Ca&s;tle, riding, as fa&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="68">
as po&s;&s;ible, to the next Stage, from whence he
wrote to his Uncle; and, di&s;patching a Me&s;&s;en|ger
with his Letter, held on his Way to <HI>Lon|don.</HI></P>
<P>The Marquis, being pretty well recovered
from his Indi&s;po&s;ition by a good Night's Re&s;t,
&s;ent for Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> in the Morning, to walk
with him, as was his Cu&s;tom, in the Garden;
but, hearing he had rode out, tho' he imagined
it was only to take the Air, yet he could not
help accu&s;ing him, in his own Thoughts, of a
little Neglect; for which he re&s;olved to chide
him, when he returned: But his long Stay fill|ing
him with &s;ome Surprize, he was beginning
to expre&s;s his Fears that &s;omething had befallen
him, to <HI>Arabella,</HI> who was then with him; when
a Servant pre&s;ented him the Letter, which Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI>'s Me&s;&s;enger had that Moment brought.</P>
<P>The Marquis ca&s;ting his Eyes on the Di|rection,
and knowing his Nephew's Hand, Ble&s;s
me, cried he, extremely &s;urpri&s;ed, What can
this mean? <HI>Bella,</HI> added he, here's a Letter
from your Cou&s;in.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> at the&s;e Words, &s;tarted up; and,
preventing her Father, with a re&s;pectful Action,
from opening it, I be&s;eech you, my Lord, &s;aid
&s;he, before you read this Letter, &s;uffer me to
a&s;&s;ure you, that, if it contains any thing fatal,
I am not at all acce&s;&s;ary to it: 'Tis true I have
bani&s;hed my Cou&s;in, as a Puni&s;hment for the
Offence he was guilty of towards me; but, Hea|ven
is my Witne&s;s, I did not de&s;ign his Death;
and if he has taken any violent Re&s;olution again&s;t
him&s;elf, he has greatly exceeded my Com|mands.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="69">
The Marquis, who&s;e Surprize was con&s;idera|bly
increa&s;ed by the&s;e Words, ha&s;tily broke
open the Letter, which &s;he perceiving, hurried
out of the Room; and, locking her&s;elf up in
her Clo&s;et, began to bewail the Effect of her
Charms, as if &s;he was perfectly a&s;&s;ured of her
Cou&s;in's Death.</P>
<P>The Marquis, however, who, from Lady
<HI>Bella</HI>'s Exclamation, had prepared him&s;elf for the
Knowlege of &s;ome very extraordinary Accident,
was le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed, than he would otherwi&s;e have
been, at the Contents; which were as follow:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my leaving your Hou&s;e &s;o abruptly will
certainly make me appear guilty of a mo&s;t
unpardonable Rudene&s;s, I cannot di&s;pen&s;e with
my&s;elf from acquainting your Lord&s;hip with the
Cau&s;e; though, to &s;pare the Reproaches Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> will probably ca&s;t on me for doing &s;o, I
could wi&s;h you knew it by any other Means.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, I value your E&s;teem too much
to hazard the Lo&s;s of it by &s;uffering you to ima|gine,
that I am capable of doing any thing to
di&s;plea&s;e you. Lady <HI>Bella</HI> was plea&s;ed to order
me to &s;tay no longer in the Hou&s;e; and menaced
me with &s;ome very terrible U&s;age, if I di&s;obeyed
her: She u&s;ed &s;o many other contemptuous Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
to me, that, I am per&s;uaded, I &s;hall
never be &s;o happy as to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Honour you

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="54" REF="70">
When the Marquis had read this Letter, he
went to his Daughter's Apartment with an In|tention
to chide her &s;everely for her U&s;age of his
Nephew; but, &s;eeing her come to meet him
with her Eyes bathed in Tears, he in&s;en&s;ibly
lo&s;t &s;ome Part of his Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Alas! my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, I know you come
prepared to load me with Reproaches, upon my
Cou&s;in's Account; but, I be&s;eech your Lord|&s;hip,
do not aggravate my Sorrows: Tho' I ba|ni&s;hed
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> I did not de&s;ire his Death;
and, que&s;tionle&s;s, if he knew how I <HI>re&s;ent</HI> it,
his Gho&s;t would be &s;atisfied with the Sacrifice
I make him.</P>
<P>The Marquis, not being able to help &s;miling
at this Conceit, which he &s;aw had &s;o &s;trongly
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her Imagination, that &s;he had no &s;ort
of Doubt but that her Cou&s;in was dead, a&s;ked
her, If &s;he really believed Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> loved
her well enough to die with Grief at her ill U&s;age
of him?</P>
<P>If, &s;aid &s;he, he loves me not well enough to
die for me, he certainly loves me but little; and
I am the le&s;s obliged to him.</P>
<P>But I de&s;ire to know, interrupted the Mar|quis,
For what Crime it was you took the Li|berty
to bani&s;h him from my Hou&s;e?</P>
<P>I bani&s;hed him, my Lord, re&s;umed &s;he, for
his Pre&s;umption in telling me he loved me.</P>
<P>That Pre&s;umption, as you call it, tho' I
know not for what Rea&s;on, &s;aid the Marquis,
was authorized by me: Therefore, know, <HI>Bella,</HI>
that I not only permit him to love you, but I
al&s;o expect you &s;hould endeavour to return his
Affection; and look upon him as the Man
<PB N="55" REF="71">
whom I de&s;ign for your Hu&s;band: There's his
Letter, pur&s;ued he, putting it into her Hand.
I blu&s;h for the Rudene&s;s you have been guilty
of; but endeavour to repair it, by a more ob|liging
Behaviour for the future: I am going to
&s;end after him immediately to prevail upon to
return: Therefore, write him an Apology, I
charge you; and have it done by the Time my
Me&s;&s;enger is ready to &s;et out.</P>
<P>Saying this, he went out of the Room; and
<HI>Arabella</HI> eagerly opened the Letter; and, finding
it in a Style &s;o different from what &s;he expected,
her Di&s;like of him returned with more Violence
than ever.</P>
<P>Ah! the Traitor! &s;aid &s;he aloud, Is it thus
that he endeavours to move my Compa&s;&s;ion?
How greatly did I over-rate his Affection, when
I imagined his De&s;pair was capable of killing
him? Di&s;loyal Man! pur&s;ued &s;he, walking
about, Is it by Complaints to my Father that
thou expecte&s;t to &s;ucceed? And do&s;t thou ima|gine
the Heart of <HI>Arabella</HI> is to be won by Vio|lence
and Inju&s;tice?</P>
<P>In this manner &s;he wa&s;ted the Time allotted
for her to write; and, when the Marquis &s;ent
for her Letter, having no Intention to comply,
&s;he went to his Chamber, conjuring him not to
oblige her to a Conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;o unworthy of
her.</P>
<P>The Marquis, being now exce&s;&s;ively angry
with her, ro&s;e up in a Fury, and, leading her
to his Writing-De&s;k, ordered her, in&s;tantly, to
write to her Cou&s;in.</P>
<P>If I mu&s;t write, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, &s;obbing,
pray be &s;o good as to dictate what I mu&s;t &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="72">
Apologize for your rude Behaviour, &s;aid the
Marquis; and de&s;ire him, in the mo&s;t obliging
manner you can, to return.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;eeing there was a nece&s;&s;ity for obey|ing,
took up the Pen, and wrote the following
Billet:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>The unfortunate Arabella, to the mo&s;t ungenerous

<P>IT is not by the Power I have over you, that
I command you to return, for I di&s;claim any

it is my Father's Plea&s;ure I &s;hould invite you
back, I mu&s;t let you know, that I repeal your
Bani&s;hment, and expect you will immediately
return with the Me&s;&s;enger who brings this; how|ever,
to &s;pare your Acknowlegements, know,
that it is in Obedience to my Father's ab&s;olute
Commands, that you receive this Mandate
from</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Arabella.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having fini&s;hed this Billet, &s;he gave it to the
Marquis to read; who, finding a great deal of
his own Haughtine&s;s of Temper in it, could not
re&s;olve to check her for a Di&s;po&s;ition &s;o like his
own: Yet he told her, her Stile was very uncom|mon:
And pray, added he, &s;miling, who taught
you to &s;uper&s;cribe your Letters thus, <Q>The un|fortunate
<HI>Arabella,</HI> to the mo&s;t ungenerous
<HI>Glanville?</HI></Q> Why, <HI>Bella,</HI> this Super&s;cription is
wholly calculated for the Bearer's Information:
But come, alter it immediately; for I don't
choo&s;e my Me&s;&s;enger &s;hould know, that you
<PB N="57" REF="73">
are unfortunate, or that my Nephew is unge|nerous.</P>
<P>Pray, my Lord, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> content
your&s;elf with what I have already done in Obe|dience
to your Commands, and &s;uffer my Letter
to remain as it is: Methinks it is but rea&s;onable
I &s;hould expre&s;s &s;ome little Re&s;entment at the
Complaint my Cou&s;in has been plea&s;ed to make
to you again&s;t me; nor can I po&s;&s;ibly make my
Letter more obliging, without being guilty of
an unpardonable Meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>You are a &s;trange Girl, replied the Marquis,
taking the Letter, and inclo&s;ing it in one from
him&s;elf; in which he earne&s;tly intreated his
Nephew to return, threatening him with his
Di&s;plea&s;ure, if he di&s;obeyed; and a&s;&s;uring him,
that his Daughter would receive him as well as
he could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The Me&s;&s;enger being di&s;patched, with Orders
to ride Po&s;t, and overtake the young Gentle|man,
he obeyed his Orders &s;o well, that he came
up with him at&mdash;, where he intended to lodge
that Night.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who expected his Uncle would
make u&s;e of &s;ome Methods to recal him, opened
his Letter without any great Emotion; but &s;ee|ing
another inclo&s;ed, his Heart leaped to his
Mouth, not doubting but it was a Letter from
<HI>Arabella;</HI> but the Contents &s;urpri&s;ed him &s;o
much, that he hardly knew whether he ought to
look upon them as an Invitation to return, or
a new Affront, her Words were &s;o di&s;tant and
haughty. The Super&s;cription being much the
&s;ame with a Billet he had received from her in
the Garden, which had made him conclude her
<PB N="58" REF="74">
in Je&s;t, he knew not what to think of it: One
would &s;wear this dear Girl's Head is turned,
&s;aid he to him&s;elf, if &s;he had not more <HI>Wit</HI> than
her whole Sex be&s;ides.</P>
<P>After reading <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Letter &s;everal times,
he at la&s;t opened his Uncle's; and, &s;eeing the
pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances he made him to return, he
re&s;olved to obey; and the next Morning &s;et out
for the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> during the time her Cou&s;in was
expected, appeared &s;o melancholy and re&s;erved,
that the Marquis was extremely unea&s;y: You
have never, &s;aid he to her, di&s;obeyed me in any
one Action of your Life; and I may with rea&s;on
expect you will conform to my Will in the Choice
I have made of a Hu&s;band for you, &s;ince it is
impo&s;&s;ible to make any Objection either to his
Per&s;on or Mind; and, being the Son of my
Si&s;ter, he is certainly not unworthy of you, tho'
he has not a Title.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t Wi&s;h, my Lord, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> is
to live &s;ingle, not being de&s;irous of entering into
any Engagement which may hinder my Solici|tude
and Cares, and le&s;&s;en my Attendance, upon
the be&s;t of Fathers, who, till now, has always
mo&s;t tenderly complied with my Inclinations
in every thing: But if it is your ab&s;olute Com|mand,
that I &s;hould marry, give me not to one
who, tho' he has the Honour to be allied to you,
has neither merited your E&s;teem, or my Favour,
by any Action worthy of his Birth, or the Pa&s;|&s;ion
he pretends to have for me; for, in fine,
my Lord, by what Services has he de&s;erved the
Di&s;tinction with which you honour him? Has
he ever delivered you from any con&s;iderable
<PB N="59" REF="75">
Danger? Has he &s;aved your Life, and hazarded
his own, for you, upon any Occa&s;ion whatever?
Has he merited my E&s;teem, by his Sufferings,
Fidelity, and Re&s;pect; or, by any great and
generous Action, given me a Te&s;timony of his
Love, which &s;hould oblige me to reward him
with my Affection? Ah! my Lord, I be&s;eech
you, think not &s;o unworthily of your Daughter,
as to be&s;tow her upon one who has done &s;o
little to de&s;erve her: If my Happine&s;s be dear
to you, do not precipitate me into a State from
whence you cannot recal me, with a Per&s;on
whom I can never affect.</P>
<P>She would have gone on, but the Marquis in|terrupted
her &s;ternly: I'll hear no more, &s;aid
he, of your fooli&s;h and ridiculous Objections;
What Stuff is this you talk of? What Service
am I to expect from my Nephew? And by
what Sufferings is he to merit your E&s;teem?
A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, <HI>Arabella,</HI> continued he, that
I will never pardon you, if you pre&s;ume to treat
my Nephew in the Manner you have done: I
perceive you have no real Objection to make to
him; therefore I expect you will endeavour to
obey me without Reluctance; for, &s;ince you
&s;eem to be &s;o little acquainted with what will
mo&s;t conduce to your own Happine&s;s, you mu&s;t
not think it &s;trange, if I in&s;i&s;t upon directing
your Choice in the mo&s;t important Bu&s;ine&s;s of
your Life.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was going to reply; but the Marquis
ordered her to be &s;ilent; and &s;he went to her
own Apartment in &s;o much Affliction, that &s;he
thought her Misfortunes were not exceeded by
any &s;he had ever read.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which a logical Argument is un&s;ea&s;on|ably
interrupted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Marquis was al&s;o extremely unea&s;y
at her Ob&s;tinacy: He de&s;ired nothing more
ardently than to marry her to his Nephew; but
he could not re&s;olve to force her Con&s;ent; and,
however determined he appeared to her, yet,
in Reality, he intended only to u&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ions
to effect what he de&s;ired; and, from the natural
Sweetne&s;s of her Temper, he was &s;ometimes
not without Hopes, that &s;he might, at la&s;t, be
prevailed upon to comply.</P>
<P>His Nephew's Return re&s;tored him to Part of
his u&s;ual Tranquillity: After he had gently chid
him for &s;uffering him&s;elf to be &s;o far tran&s;ported
with his Re&s;entment at the little Humours of a
Lady, as to leave his Hou&s;e, without acquaint|ing
him, he bid him go to <HI>Arabella,</HI> and en|deavour
to make his Peace with her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> accordingly went to her Apart|ment,
re&s;olving to oblige her to come to &s;ome
Explanation with him concerning the Offence
&s;he complained of; but that fair incen&s;ed Lady,
who had taken Shelter in her Clo&s;et, ordered
<HI>Lucy</HI> to tell him &s;he was indi&s;po&s;ed, and could
not &s;ee him.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> however, comforted him&s;elf for
this Di&s;appointment by the Hopes of &s;eeing her
at Supper; and accordingly &s;he came, when the
Supper-Bell rung, and, making a very cool Com|pliment
to her Cou&s;in, placed her&s;elf at Table:
<PB N="61" REF="77">
The &s;oft Languor that appeared in her Eyes,
gave &s;uch an additional Charm to one of the
lovelie&s;t Faces in the World, that <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who &s;at oppo&s;ite to her, could not help gazing
on her with a very particular Attention; he
often &s;poke to her, and a&s;ked her trifling Que&s;|tions,
for the &s;ake of hearing the Sound of her
Voice, which Sorrow had made inchantingly
&s;weet.</P>
<P>When Supper was over, &s;he would have re|tired;
but the Marquis de&s;ired her to &s;tay and
entertain her Cou&s;in, while he went to look over
&s;ome Di&s;patches he had received from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> blu&s;hed with Anger at this Com|mand;
but, not daring to di&s;obey, &s;he kept her
Eyes fixed on the Ground, as if &s;he dreaded to
hear &s;omething that would di&s;plea&s;e her.</P>
<P>Well, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' you de&s;ire
to have no Empire over &s;o unworthy a Subject
as my&s;elf, yet I hope you are not di&s;plea&s;ed at
my returning, in Obedience to your Commands.</P>
<P>Since I am not allowed any Will of my own,
&s;aid &s;he, &s;ighing, it matters not whether I am
plea&s;ed, or di&s;plea&s;ed; nor is it of any Con&s;e|quence
to you to know.</P>
<P>Indeed but it is, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> interrupted he;
for if I knew how to plea&s;e you, I would never,
if I could help it, offend: Therefore, I beg you,
tell me how I have di&s;obliged you; for, certainly,
you have treated me as har&s;hly as if I had been
guilty of &s;ome very terrible Offence.</P>
<P>You had the Boldne&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, to talk to
me of Love; and you well know that Per&s;ons
of my Sex and Quality are not permitted to
<PB N="62" REF="78">
li&s;ten to &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es; and if, for that Of|fence,
I bani&s;hed you my Pre&s;ence, I did no
more than Decency required of me; and which
I would yet do, were I Mi&s;tre&s;s of my own
Actions.</P>
<P>But is it po&s;&s;ible, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> that
you can be angry with any one for loving you?
Is that a Crime of &s;o high a Nature as to merit
an eternal Bani&s;hment from your Pre&s;ence?</P>
<P>Without telling you, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> blu&s;hing,
whether I am angry at being loved, 'tis &s;ufficient
you know, that I will not pardon the Man who
&s;hall have the Pre&s;umption to tell me he loves me.</P>
<P>But, Madam, interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI> if the
Per&s;on who tells you he loves you, be of a
Rank not beneath you, I conceive you are not
at all injured by the favourable Sentiments he
feels for you; and, tho' you are not di&s;po&s;ed to
make any Returns to his Pa&s;&s;ion, yet you are cer|tainly
obliged to him for his good Opinion.</P>
<P>Since Love is not voluntary, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
I am not obliged to any Per&s;on for loving me;
for, que&s;tionle&s;s, if he could help it, he would.</P>
<P>If it is not a voluntary Favour, interrupted
<HI>Glanville,</HI> it is not a voluntary Offence; and, if
you do not think your&s;elf obliged by the one,
neither are you at Liberty to be offended with
the other.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> is not whether
I ought to be offended at being loved, but
whether it is not an Offence to be told I am &s;o.</P>
<P>If there is nothing criminal in the Pa&s;&s;ion it|&s;elf,
Madam, re&s;umed <HI>Glanville,</HI> certainly there
can be no Crime in declaring it.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="79">
However &s;pecious your Arguments may appear,
interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> I am per&s;uaded it is an
unpardonable Crime to tell a Lady you love
her; and, tho' I had nothing el&s;e to plead, yet
the Authority of Cu&s;tom is &s;ufficient to prove it.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;miling&punc;
is wholly on my Side; for the Ladies are &s;o far
from being di&s;plea&s;ed at the Addre&s;&s;es of their
Lovers, that their chiefe&s;t Care is to gain them,
and their greate&s;t Triumph to hear them talk of
their Pa&s;&s;ion: So, Madam, I hope you'll allow
that Argument has no Force.</P>
<P>I don't know, an&s;wered <HI>Arabella,</HI> what Sort
of Ladies there are who allow &s;uch unbe|coming
Liberties, but I am certain, that <HI>Statira,
Pari&s;atis, Clelia, Mandana,</HI> and all the illu&s;tri|ous
Heroines of Antiquity, whom it is a Glory
to re&s;emble, would never admit of &s;uch Di&s;|cour&s;es.</P>
<P>Ah for Heaven's &s;ake, Cou&s;in, interrupted
<HI>Glanville,</HI> endeavouring to &s;tifle a Laugh, do not
&s;uffer your&s;elf to be governed by &s;uch antiquated
Maxims! The World is quite different to what
it was in tho&s;e Days; and the Ladies in this
Age would as &s;oon follow the Fa&s;hions of the
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Ladies, as mimick their
Manners; and I believe they would become one
as ill as the other.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> the World is not
more virtuous now than it was in their Days,
and there is good Rea&s;on to believe it is not
much wi&s;er; and I don't &s;ee why the Manners
of this Age are to be preferred to tho&s;e of for|mer
ones, unle&s;s they are wi&s;er and better:
However, I cannot be per&s;uaded, that Things
<PB N="64" REF="80">
are as you &s;ay, and that when I am a little better
acquainted with the World, I &s;hall find as many
Per&s;ons who re&s;emble <HI>Oroondates, Artaxerxes,</HI>
and the illu&s;trious Lovers of <HI>Clelia,</HI> as tho&s;e
who are like <HI>Tiriba&s;es, Artaxes,</HI> and the pre|&s;uming
and in&s;olent <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>By the Epithets you give me Madam, &s;aid
<HI>Glanville,</HI> I find you have placed me in very
bad Company: But pray, Madam, if the
illu&s;trious Lover of <HI>Clelia</HI> had never di&s;covered
his Pa&s;&s;ion, how would the World have come
to the Knowledge of it?</P>
<P>He did not di&s;cover his Pa&s;&s;ion, Sir, re&s;umed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> till, by the Services he did the noble
<HI>Clelius,</HI> and his incomparable Daughter, he
could plead &s;ome Title to their E&s;teem: He &s;e|veral
times pre&s;erved the Life of that renowned
<HI>Roman;</HI> delivered the beautiful <HI>Clelia</HI> when
&s;he was a Captive; and, in fine, conferred &s;o
many Obligations upon them, and all their
Friends, as he might well expect to be par|doned
by the divine <HI>Clelia</HI> for daring to love
her. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he u&s;ed him very har&s;hly,
when he fir&s;t declared his Pa&s;&s;ion, and bani&s;hed
him al&s;o from her Pre&s;ence; and it was a long
time before &s;he could prevail upon her&s;elf to
compa&s;&s;ionate his Sufferings.</P>
<P>The Marquis coming in interrupted <HI>Ara|bella;</HI>
upon which &s;he took Occa&s;ion to retire;
leaving <HI>Glanville</HI> more captivated with her than
ever.</P>
<P>He found her U&s;age of him was grounded
upon Examples &s;he thought it her Duty to fol|low;
and, &s;trange as her Notions of Life ap|peared,
yet they were &s;upported with &s;o much
<PB N="65" REF="81">
Wit and Delicacy, that he could not help ad|miring
her, while he fore&s;aw, the Oddity of her
Humour would throw innumerable Difficulties
in his Way, before he &s;hould be able to obtain
her.</P>
<P>However, as he was really pa&s;&s;ionately in
Love with her, he re&s;olved to accommodate
him&s;elf, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to her Ta&s;te, and
endeavour to gain her Heart by a Behaviour
mo&s;t agreeable to her: He therefore a&s;&s;umed an
Air of great Di&s;tance and Re&s;pect; never men|tioned
his Affection, nor the Intentions of her
Father in his Favour; and the Marquis, ob|&s;erving
his Daughter conver&s;ed with him with
le&s;s Reluctance than u&s;ual, leaving to Time,
and the Merit of his Nephew, to di&s;po&s;e her to
comply with his De&s;ires, re&s;olved not to inter|po&s;e
his Authority in an Affair upon which her
own Happine&s;s &s;o much depended.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Reader will find a Specimen
of the true Pathetic, in a Speech of
Oroondates.&mdash;The Adventure of the
Books.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA</HI> &s;aw the Change in her
Cou&s;in's Behaviour with a great deal of
Satisfaction; for &s;he did not doubt but his Pa&s;&s;ion
was as &s;trong as ever; but that he forbore,
thro' Re&s;pect, from entertaining her with any
<PB N="66" REF="82">
Expre&s;&s;ions of it: Therefore &s;he now conver&s;ed
with him with the greate&s;t Sweetne&s;s and Com|plai&s;ance:
She would walk with him for &s;everal
Hours in the Garden, leaning upon his Arm;
and charmed him to the la&s;t Degree of Admira|tion
by the agreeable Sallies of her Wit, and
her fine Rea&s;oning upon every Subject he pro|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was with the greate&s;t Difficulty he re&s;train|ed
him&s;elf from telling her a Thou&s;and times a
Day that he loved her to Exce&s;s, and conjuring
her to give her Con&s;ent to her Father's De&s;igns
in his Favour: But, tho' he could get over
his Fears of offending her, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible
to expre&s;s any Sentiments of this Nature to her,
without having her Women Witne&s;&s;es of his
Di&s;cour&s;e; for, when he walked with her in
the Garden, <HI>Lucy,</HI> and another Attendant, al|ways
followed her: If he &s;at with her in her
own Chamber, her Women were always at one
End of it: And, when they were both in the
Marquis's Apartment, where her Women did
not follow her, poor <HI>Glanville</HI> found him&s;elf
embarra&s;&s;ed by his Pre&s;ence; for, conceiving
his Nephew had Opportunities enough of talk|ing
to his Daughter in private, he always partook
of their Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Weeks in this Manner, ex|tremely
chagrined at the little Progre&s;s he made;
and was beginning to be heartily weary of the
Con&s;traint he laid upon him&s;elf, when <HI>Arabella,</HI>
one Day, furni&s;hed him, without de&s;igning it,
with an Opportunity of talking to her on the
Subject he wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="83">
When I reflect, &s;aid &s;he, laughing, upon the
Difference there was between us &s;ome Days
ago, and the Familiarity in which we live at
pre&s;ent, I cannot imagine by what means you
have arrived to a good Fortune you had &s;o little
Rea&s;on to expect; for, in fine, you have given
me no Signs of Repentance for the Fault you
committed, which moved me to bani&s;h you;
and I am not certain whether, in conver&s;ing
with you in the manner I do, I give you not as
much Rea&s;on to find Fault with my too great
Ea&s;ine&s;s, as you did me to be di&s;plea&s;ed with
your Pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>Since, returned <HI>Glanville,</HI> I have not per&s;i&s;ted
in the Commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Faults which di&s;|plea&s;ed
you, what greater Signs of Repentance
can you de&s;ire, than this Reformation in my Be|haviour?</P>
<P>But Repentance ought to precede Reforma|tion,
replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> otherwi&s;e, there is great
room to &s;u&s;pect it is only feigned: And a &s;incere
Repentance &s;hews it&s;elf in &s;uch vi&s;ible Marks,
that one can hardly be deceived in that which is
genuine. I have read of many indi&s;creet Lovers,
who not &s;ucceeding in their Addre&s;&s;es, have
pretended to repent, and acted as you do; that
is, without giving any Signs of Contrition for
the Fault they had committed, have eat and
&s;lept well, never lo&s;t their Colour, or grew one
bit thinner, by their Sorrow; but contented
them&s;elves with &s;aying they repented; and,
without changing thetr Di&s;po&s;ition to renew
their Fault, only concealed their Intention, for
fear of lo&s;ing any favourable Opportunity of
committing it again: But true Repentance, as
<PB N="68" REF="84">
I was &s;aying, not only produces Reformation,
but the Per&s;on who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it voluntarily
puni&s;hes him&s;elf for the Faults he has been
guilty of. Thus <HI>Mazares,</HI> deeply repenting of
the Crime his Pa&s;&s;ion for the divine <HI>Manda<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">a</HI>
had forced him to commit; as a Puni&s;hment,
obliged him&s;elf to follow the Fortune of his
glorious Rival; obey all his Commands; and,
fighting under his Banners, a&s;&s;ist him to gain
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his adored Mi&s;tre&s;s. Such a
glorious In&s;tance of Self-denial was, indeed, a
&s;ufficient Proof of his Repentance; and infi|nitely
more convincing than the Silence he im|po&s;ed
upon him&s;elf with re&s;pect to his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Oroondates,</HI> to puni&s;h him&s;elf for his Pre|&s;umption,
in daring to tell the admirable <HI>Statira,</HI>
that he loved her, re&s;olved to die, to expiate
his Crime; and, doubtle&s;s, would have done &s;o,
if his fair Mi&s;tre&s;s, at the Intreaty of her Bro|ther,
had not commanded him to live.</P>
<P>But pray, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI>
were not the&s;e Gentlemen happy at la&s;t in the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es?</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s they were, Sir, re&s;umed &s;he; but
it was not till after numberle&s;s Misfortunes, in|finite
Services, and many dangerous Adventures,
in which their Fidelity was put to the &s;tronge&s;t
Trials imaginable.</P>
<P>I am glad, however, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> that the
Ladies were not in&s;en&s;ible; for, &s;ince you do
not di&s;approve of their Compa&s;&s;ion for their
Lovers, it is to be hoped you will not be always
as inexorable as you are now.</P>
<P>When I &s;hall be &s;o fortunate, interrupted &s;he,
to meet with a Lover who &s;hall have as pure
<PB N="69" REF="85">
and perfect a Pa&s;&s;ion for me, as <HI>Oroondates</HI> had
for <HI>Statira;</HI> and give me as many glorious
Proofs of his Con&s;tancy and Affection, doubt|le&s;s
I &s;hall not be ungrateful: But, &s;ince I have
not the Merits of <HI>Statira,</HI> I ought not to pre|tend
to her good Fortune; and &s;hall be very
well contented if I e&s;cape the Per&s;ecutions which
Per&s;ons of my Sex, who are not frightfully ugly,
are always expo&s;ed to, without hoping to in&s;pire
&s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion as that of <HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to be better acquainted with
the Actions of this happy Lover, Madam, &s;aid
<HI>Glanville;</HI> that, forming my&s;elf upon his Ex|ample,
I may hope to plea&s;e a Lady as worthy
of my Regard as <HI>Statira</HI> was of his.</P>
<P>For Heaven's &s;ake, Cou&s;in, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI>
laughing, how have you &s;pent your Time;
and to what Studies have you devoted all your
Hours, that you could find none to &s;pare for
the Peru&s;al of Books from which all u&s;eful
Knowledge may be drawn; which give us the
mo&s;t &s;hining Examples of Genero&s;ity, Courage,
Virtue, and Love; which regulate our Actions,
form our Manners, and in&s;pire us with a noble
De&s;ire of emulating tho&s;e great, heroic, and
virtuous Actions, which made tho&s;e Per&s;ons &s;o
glorious in their Age, and &s;o worthy Imitation
in ours? However, as it is never too late to
improve, &s;uffer me to recommend to you the
reading of the&s;e Books, which will &s;oon make
you di&s;cover the Improprieties you have been
guilty of; and will, probably, induce you to
avoid them for the future.</P>
<P>I &s;hall certainly read them, if you de&s;ire it,
&s;aid <HI>Glanville;</HI> and I have &s;o great an Inclina|tion
<PB N="70" REF="86">
to be agreeable to you, that I &s;hall em|brace
every Opportunity of becoming &s;o; and
will therefore take my In&s;tructions from the&s;e
Books, if you think proper, or from your&s;elf&punc;
which, indeed, will be the quicke&s;t Method of
teaching me.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> having ordered one of her Women
to bring <HI>Cleopatra, Ca&s;&s;andra, Clelia,</HI> and the
Grand <HI>Cyrus,</HI> from her Library, <HI>Glanville</HI> no
&s;ooner &s;aw the Girl return, &s;inking under the
Weight of tho&s;e voluminous Romances, but he
began to tremble at the Apprehen&s;ion of his
Cou&s;in laying her Commands upon him to read
them; and repented of his Complai&s;ance, which
expo&s;ed him to the cruel Nece&s;&s;ity of performing
what to him appeared an <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour, or
el&s;e incurring her Anger by his Refu&s;al.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> making her Women place the Books
upon a Table before her, opened them, one
after another, with Eyes &s;parkling with Delight;
while <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;at rapt in Admiration at the
Sight of &s;o many huge Folio's, written, as he
conceived, upon the mo&s;t trifling Subjects
imaginable.</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en out the&s;e few, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI>
(not ob&s;erving his Con&s;ternation) from a great
many others, which compo&s;e the mo&s;t valuable
Part of my Library; and, by that time you
have gone thro' the&s;e, I imagine you will be
con&s;iderably improved.</P>
<P>Certainly, Madam, replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> turn|ing
over the Leaves in great Confu&s;ion, one
may, as you &s;ay, be greatly improved; for the&s;e
Books contain a great deal: And, looking over
a Page of <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> without any De&s;ign, read
<PB N="71" REF="87">
the&s;e Words, which were Part of <HI>Oroondates</HI>'s
Soliloquy when he received a cruel Sentence
from <HI>Statira:</HI></P>
<Q><P>Ah cruel! &s;ays this mi&s;erable Lover, and
what have I done to merit it? Examine the
Nature of my Offence, and you will &s;ee I am
not &s;o guilty, but that my Death may free me
from Part of that Severity: Shall your Hatred
la&s;t longer than my Life? And can you dete&s;t
a Soul that for&s;akes its Body only to obey
you? No, no, you are not &s;o hard-hearted;
that Satisfaction will, doubtle&s;s, content you:
And, when I &s;hall cea&s;e to be, doubtle&s;s I
&s;hall cea&s;e to be odious to you.</P></Q>
<P>Upon my Soul, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;tifling a
Laugh with great Difficulty, I cannot help
blaming the Lady this &s;orrowful Lover com|plains
of, for her great Cruelty; for here he
gives one Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;he will not
even be contented with his dying in Obedience
to her Commands, but will hate him after
Death; an Impiety quite inexcu&s;able in a
Chri&s;tian!</P>
<P>You condemn this illu&s;trious Prince&s;s with
very little Rea&s;on, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;miling
at his Mi&s;take; for, be&s;ides that &s;he was not a
Chri&s;tian, and ignorant of tho&s;e Divine Maxims
of Charity and Forgivene&s;s, which Chri&s;tians,
by their Profe&s;&s;ion, are obliged to practi&s;e, &s;he
was very far from de&s;iring the Death of <HI>Oroon|dates;</HI>
for, if you will take the Pains to read
the &s;ucceeding Pa&s;&s;ages, you will find that &s;he
expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf in the mo&s;t obliging Manner in
the World; for when <HI>Oroondates</HI> tells her he
would live, if &s;he would con&s;ent he &s;hould, the
<PB N="72" REF="88">
Prince&s;s mo&s;t &s;weetly replies,<Q> I not only con|&s;ent,
but al&s;o intreat it; and, if I have any
Power, command it.</Q> However, le&s;t you
&s;hould fall into the other Extreme, and blame
this great Prince&s;s for her Ea&s;ine&s;s (as you be|fore
condemned her for her Cruelty), 'tis nece&s;|&s;ary
you &s;hould know how &s;he was induced to
this favourable Behaviour to her Lover: There|fore
pray read the whole Tran&s;action. Stay!
here it begins, continued &s;he; turning over a
good many Pages, and marking where he &s;hould
begin to read.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> having no great Stomach to the
Ta&s;k, endeavoured to evade it, by intreating
his Cou&s;in to relate the Pa&s;&s;ages &s;he de&s;ired he
&s;hould be acquainted with: But &s;he declining it,
he was obliged to obey; and began to read
where &s;he directed him: And, to leave him at
Liberty to read with the greater Attention, &s;he
left him, and went to a Window at another
End of the Chamber.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was not willing to di&s;|plea&s;e
her, examined the Ta&s;k &s;he had &s;et him,
re&s;olving, if it was not a very hard one, to
comply; but, counting the Pages, he was quite
terrified at the Number, and could not prevail
upon him&s;elf to read them: Therefore, glancing
them over, he pretended to be deeply engaged
in reading, when, in Reality, he was contem|plating
the &s;urpri&s;ing Effect the&s;e Books had
produced in the Mind of his Cou&s;in; who,
had &s;he been untainted with the ridiculous
Whims they created in her Imagination, was,
in his Opinion, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed
Ladies in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="89">
When he had &s;at long enough to make her
believe he had read what &s;he had de&s;ired, he
ro&s;e up, and, joining her at the Window, began
to talk of the Plea&s;antne&s;s of the Evening, in|&s;tead
of the Rigour of <HI>Statira.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> coloured with Vexation at his ex|treme
Indifference in a Matter which was of
&s;uch prodigious Con&s;equence, in her Opinion;
but di&s;daining to put him in mind of his Rude|ne&s;s,
in quitting a Subject they had not
thoroughly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and which &s;he had taken
&s;o much Pains to make him comprehend, &s;he
continued &s;ilent; and would not conde&s;cend to
afford him an An&s;wer to any thing he &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> by her Silence and Frowns, was
made &s;en&s;ible of his Fault; and, to repair it,
began to talk of the inexorable <HI>Statira,</HI> though,
indeed, he did not well know what to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> clearing up a little, did not di&s;dain
to an&s;wer him upon her favourite Topic: I
knew, &s;aid &s;he, you would be ready to blame
this Prince&s;s equally for her Rigour and her
Kindne&s;s; but it mu&s;t be remembred that,
what &s;he did in Favour of <HI>Oroondates,</HI> was
wholly owing to the Genero&s;ity of <HI>Artaxerxes.</HI></P>
<P>Here &s;he &s;topped, expecting <HI>Glanville</HI> to give
his Opinion; who, &s;trangely puzzled, replied
at random, To be &s;ure, Madam, he was a very
generous Rival.</P>
<P>Rival! cried <HI>Arabella; Artaxerxes</HI> the Rival
of <HI>Oroondates!</HI> Why certainly you have lo&s;t your
Wits: He was <HI>Statira</HI>'s Brother; and it was to
his Mediation that <HI>Oroondates,</HI> or <HI>Orontes,</HI> owed
his Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="90">
Certainly, Madam, replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> it was
very generous in <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> as he was Brother
to <HI>Statira,</HI> to interpo&s;e in the Behalf of an un|fortunate
Lover; and both <HI>Oroondates,</HI> and
<HI>Orontes,</HI> were extremely obliged to him.</P>
<P><HI>Orontes,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> was more obliged
to him than <HI>Oroondates;</HI> &s;ince the Quality of
<HI>Orontes</HI> was infinitely below that of <HI>Oroondates.</HI></P>
<P>But, Madam, interrupted <HI>Glanville</HI> (extreme|ly
plea&s;ed at his having &s;o well got over the Dif|ficulty
he had been in), which of the&s;e two
Lovers did <HI>Statira</HI> make happy?</P>
<P>This unlucky Que&s;tion immediately informed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> that &s;he had been all this time the
Dupe of her Cou&s;in; who, if he had read a
&s;ingle Page, would have known that <HI>Orontes</HI>
and <HI>Oroondates</HI> was the &s;ame Per&s;on; the Name
of <HI>Orontes</HI> being a&s;&s;umed by <HI>Oroondates,</HI> to con|ceal
his real Name and Quality.</P>
<P>The Shame and Rage &s;he conceived at &s;o
glaring a Proof of his Di&s;re&s;pect, and the Ridi|cule
to which &s;he had expo&s;ed her&s;elf, were &s;o
great, that &s;he could not find Words &s;evere
enough to expre&s;s her Re&s;entment; but, pro|te&s;ting
that no Con&s;ideration whatever &s;hould
oblige her to conver&s;e with him again, &s;he or|dered
him in&s;tantly to quit her Chamber;
and a&s;&s;ured him, if he ever attempted to ap|proach
her again, &s;he would &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t
terrible Effects of her Father's Re&s;entment, ra|ther
than be obliged to &s;ee a Per&s;on who had,
by his unworthy Behaviour, made him&s;elf her
Scorn and Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> who &s;aw him&s;elf going to be di&s;|carded
a &s;econd time, attempted, with great
<PB N="75" REF="91">
Submi&s;&s;ion, to move her to recal her cruel
Sentence; but <HI>Arabella,</HI> bur&s;ting into Tears,
complained &s;o pathetically of the Cruelty of her
De&s;tiny, in expo&s;ing her to the hated Impor|tunities
of a Man &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed, and who&s;e Pre|&s;ence
was &s;o in&s;upportable, that <HI>Glanville,</HI> think|ing
it be&s;t to let her Rage evaporate before he
attempted to pacify her, quitted her Chamber;
cur&s;ing <HI>Statira</HI> and <HI>Orontes</HI> a thou&s;and times,

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Adventure of the Books continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN this Temper he went to the Gardens to
pa&s;s over the Chagrin this unfortunate Ac|cident
had given him; when, meeting the Mar|quis,
who in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing the Cau&s;e of
that ill Humour, &s;o vi&s;ible in his Countenance,
<HI>Glanville</HI> related all that had pa&s;&s;ed; but, in
Spite of his Anger, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him
to repeat the Circum&s;tances of his Di&s;grace
without laughing, as well as the Marquis; who
thought the Story &s;o extremely diverting, that
he would needs hear it over again.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;aid he, though I &s;hall do
what I can to gain your Pardon from <HI>Bella,</HI> yet
I &s;hall not &s;cruple to own you acted extremely
wrong, in not reading what &s;he de&s;ired you;
for, be&s;ides lo&s;ing an Opportunity of obliging
her, you drew your&s;elf into a terrible Dilemma;
<PB N="76" REF="92">
for how was it po&s;&s;ible for you to evade a Di&s;|covery
of the Cheat you put upon her, when
&s;he began to talk with you upon tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages
&s;he had de&s;ired you to read?</P>
<P>I acknowledge my Error, my Lord, an&s;wered
<HI>Glanville;</HI> but if you re&s;tore me to my Cou&s;in's
Favour again, I promi&s;e you to repair it by a
different Behaviour for the future.</P>
<P>I'll &s;ee what I can do for you, &s;aid the Mar|quis;
leaving him, to go to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Apart|ment,
who had retired to her Clo&s;et, extremely
afflicted at this new In&s;ult &s;he had received
from her Cou&s;in: Her Grief was the more
poignant, as &s;he was beginning to imagine, by
the Alteration in his Behaviour, that he would
prove &s;uch a Lover as &s;he wi&s;hed; for Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI>'s Per&s;on and Qualifications had at|tracted
her particular Notice: And, to &s;peak
in the Language of Romance, &s;he did not hate
him; but, on the contrary, was very much
di&s;po&s;ed to wi&s;h him well: Therefore, it was no
Wonder &s;he extremely re&s;ented the Affront &s;he
had received from him.</P>
<P>The Marquis, not finding her in her Chamber,
proceeded to her Clo&s;et, where her Women
informed him &s;he was retired; and, knocking
gently at the Door, was admitted by <HI>Arabella,</HI>
whom he immediately di&s;cerned to have been
weeping very much; for her fine Eyes were red
and &s;welled, and the Traces of her Tears might
&s;till be ob&s;erved on her fair Face; which, at the
Sight of the Marquis, was over&s;pread with a
Blu&s;h, as if &s;he was con&s;cious of her Weak|ne&s;s
in lamenting the Crime her Cou&s;in had been
guilty of.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="93">
The Marquis drew a favourable Omen for his
Nephew from her Tears and Confu&s;ion; but,
not willing to increa&s;e it, by acknowleging he
had ob&s;erved it, he told her he was come, at
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Reque&s;t, to make up the Quar|rel
between them.</P>
<P>Ah! my Lord, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;peak
no more to me of that unworthy Man, who
has &s;o gro&s;ly abu&s;ed my Favour, and the Pri|vilege
I allowed him: His Ba&s;ene&s;s and Ingrati|tude
are but too manife&s;t; and there is nothing
I &s;o much regret as my Weakne&s;s in re&s;toring
him to Part of my good Opinion, after he had
once forfeited it, by an In&s;olence not to be pa|ralleled.</P>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid the Marquis, &s;miling, you
re&s;ent too deeply the&s;e &s;light Matters: I can't
think my Nephew &s;o guilty as you would have
me believe he is; and you ought neither to be
angry or &s;urpri&s;ed, that he preferred your Con|ver&s;ation
before reading in a fooli&s;h old-fa&s;hioned
Book that you put in his Hands.</P>
<P>If your Lord&s;hip had ever read the&s;e Books,
replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> reddening with Vexation, 'tis
probable you would have another Opinion of
them; but, however that may be, my Cou&s;in is
not to be excu&s;ed for the Contempt he &s;hewed
to my Commands; and for daring, by the Cheat
he put on me, to expo&s;e me to the Shame of
&s;eeing my&s;elf &s;o ridiculou&s;ly impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>However, you mu&s;t forgive him, &s;aid the
Marquis; and I in&s;i&s;t upon it, before I quit your
Apartment, that you receive him into Favour.</P>
<P>Pardon me, my Lord, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> this
is what I neither can, nor ought to do; and I
<PB N="78" REF="94">
hope you will not wrong me &s;o much as to
continue to de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid he, this is carrying Things
too far, and making trifling Di&s;putes of too
great Con&s;equence: I am &s;urpri&s;ed at your
Treatment of a Man whom, after all, if ever
you intend to obey me, you mu&s;t con&s;ent to
marry.</P>
<P>There is no Que&s;tion, my Lord, replied &s;he,
but it would be my Glory to obey you in what|ever
is po&s;&s;ible; but this you command me now
to do, not being &s;o, I conceive you will rather
impute my Refu&s;al to Nece&s;&s;ity, than Choice.</P>
<P>How! returned the Marquis, will you en|deavour
to per&s;uade me, that it is not po&s;&s;ible
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;hould be your Hu&s;band?</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be &s;o with my Con|&s;ent,
re&s;umed <HI>Arabella;</HI> and I cannot give it
without wounding my own Quiet in a mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible manner.</P>
<P>Come, come, <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid the Marquis (fret|ting
at her extreme Ob&s;tinacy), this is too much:
I am to blame to indulge your Foibles in this
Manner: Your Cou&s;in is worthy of your Af|fection,
and you cannot refu&s;e it to him with|out
incurring my Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Since my Affection is not in my own Power
to be&s;tow, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> weeping, I know not
how to remove your Di&s;plea&s;ure; but, que&s;tion|le&s;s,
I know how to die, to avoid the Effects
of what would be to me the mo&s;t terrible Mi&s;|fortune
in the World.</P>
<P>Fooli&s;h Girl! interrupted the Marquis, how
&s;trangely do you talk? Are the Thoughts of
<PB N="79" REF="95">
Death become &s;o familiar to you, that you &s;peak
of dying with &s;o little Concern?</P>
<P>Since, my Lord, re&s;umed &s;he, in an exalted
Tone, I do not yield, either in Virtue or Courage,
to many others of my Sex, who, when per&s;e|cuted
like me, have fled to Death for Relief, I
know not why I &s;hould be thought le&s;s capable
of it than they; and if <HI>Artimi&s;a, Candace,</HI> and
the beautiful Daughter of <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> could brave
the Terrors of Death for the &s;ake of the Men
they loved, there is no Que&s;tion but I al&s;o could
imitate their Courage, to avoid the Man I have
&s;o much Rea&s;on to hate.</P>
<P>The Girl is certainly di&s;tracted, interrupted
the Marquis, exce&s;&s;ively enraged at the &s;trange
Speech &s;he had uttered: The&s;e fooli&s;h Books my
Nephew talks of have turned her Brain! Where
are they? pur&s;ued he, going into her Chamber:
I'll burn all I can lay my Hands upon.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> trembling for the Fate of her Books,
followed her Father into the Room; who &s;eeing
the Books which had cau&s;ed this woful Ad|venture
lying upon the Table, he ordered one
of her Women to carry them into his Apart|ment,
vowing he would commit them all to the
Flames.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> not daring, in the Fury he was in,
to interpo&s;e, he went out of the Room, leaving
her to bewail the Fate of &s;o many illu&s;trious
Heroes and Heroines, who, by an Effect of a
more cruel Tyranny than any they had ever ex|perienced
before, were going to be ca&s;t into the
mercile&s;s Flames; which would, doubtle&s;s, pay
very little Regard to the divine Beauties of the
admirable <HI>Clelia,</HI> or the heroic Valour of the
<PB N="80" REF="96">
brave <HI>Orontes;</HI> and the re&s;t of tho&s;e great
Princes and Prince&s;&s;es, who&s;e Actions <HI>Arabella</HI>
propo&s;ed for the Model of hers.</P>
<P>Fortune, however, which never wholly for|&s;ook
the&s;e illu&s;trious Per&s;onages, re&s;cued them
from &s;o unworthy a Fate, and brought Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> into the Marquis's Chamber ju&s;t as he
was giving Orders to have them de&s;troyed.</P>

<P>THE Marquis, as &s;oon as he &s;aw
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> told him he was
re&s;olved to cure <HI>Arabella</HI> of her
Whims, by burning the Books
that had put them into her Head:

&s;miling; and you may, if you plea&s;e, wreak
your Spite upon the&s;e Authors of your Di&s;grace,
by burning them your&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="98">
Though I have all the Rea&s;on in the World
to be enraged with that Incendiary <HI>Statira,</HI> &s;aid
<HI>Glanville</HI> laughing, for the Mi&s;chief &s;he has
done me; yet I cannot con&s;ent to put &s;uch an
Affront upon my Cou&s;in, as to burn her fa|vourite
Books: And now I think of it, my Lord,
pur&s;ued he, I'll endeavour to make a Merit with
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> by &s;aving them: Therefore &s;pare
them, at my Reque&s;t, and let me carry them
to her. I &s;hall be quite unhappy till we are
Friends again.</P>
<P>You may do as you will, &s;aid the Marquis;
but I think it encouraging her in her Follies to
give them to her again.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> without replying, eagerly took up
the Books, for fear the Marquis &s;hould change
his Mind; and, highly delighted with the Op|portunity
he had got of making his Peace with
Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> ran to her Apartment, loaded with
the&s;e kind Interce&s;&s;ors; and, making his Way by
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who would have oppo&s;ed him, penetrated
even into the Clo&s;et of the melancholy Fair-one,
who was making bitter Reflections on the Cru|elty
of her De&s;tiny, and bewailing her Lo&s;s
with a Deluge of Tears.</P>
<P>As ridiculous as the Occa&s;ion of the&s;e Tears
was, yet <HI>Glanville</HI> could not behold them with|out
being affected: A&s;&s;uming, therefore, a Coun|tenance
as &s;ad as he was able, he laid the Books
before her; and told her, he hoped &s;he would
excu&s;e his coming into her Pre&s;ence without
her Permi&s;&s;ion, &s;ince it was only to re&s;tore her
tho&s;e Books, who&s;e Lo&s;s &s;he &s;eemed &s;o greatly
to lament; and added, that it was with much
Difficulty he prevailed upon the Marquis not to
<PB N="83" REF="99">
burn them immediately; and his Fears, that he
might really do as he threatened, made him
&s;natch them up, and bring them, with &s;o little
Ceremony, into her Clo&s;et.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who&s;e Countenance brightened into
a Smile of plea&s;ing Surprize at the Sight of her
recovered Trea&s;ure, turned her bright Eyes upon
<HI>Glanville</HI> with a Look of Complacency that went
to his Heart.</P>
<P>I well perceive, &s;aid &s;he, that, in exaggera|ting
the Merit of this little Service you have done
me, you expect I &s;hould &s;uffer it to cancel your
pa&s;t Offences: I am not ungrateful enough to
be in&s;en&s;ible of any Kindne&s;s that is &s;hewn me;
and, tho' I might be excu&s;ed for &s;u&s;pecting it
was rather Policy than Friend&s;hip, that induced
you to &s;eek my Satisfaction, by &s;aving the&s;e in|nocent
Victims of my Father's Di&s;plea&s;ure, ne|verthele&s;s
I pardon you upon the Suppo&s;ition,
that you will, for the future, avoid all Occa|&s;ion

<P>At the&s;e Words, &s;he made a Sign to him to
be gone, fearing the Extravagance of his Joy
would make him throw him&s;elf at her Feet to
thank her for the infinite Favour &s;he had con|ferred
upon him; but, finding he &s;eemed di&s;|po&s;ed

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which contains a very natural Incident.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM this Time Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' he
was far from coming up to Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s
Idea of a Lover, yet, by the Pains he apparently
&s;eemed to be at in obliging her, made every
Day &s;ome Progre&s;s in her E&s;teem. The Mar|quis
was extremely plea&s;ed at the Harmony
which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them; tho' he could
have wi&s;hed to have &s;een their Marriage advance
a little fa&s;ter; but <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was better ac|quainted
with <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Foible than the Mar|quis,
a&s;&s;ured him, he would ruin all his Hopes,
if he pre&s;&s;ed her to marry; and intreated him
to leave it intirely to him, to di&s;po&s;e her to con|&s;ent
to both their Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The Marquis was &s;atisfied with his Rea&s;ons,
and, re&s;olving not to importune his Daughter,
upon that Subject, any more, they lived for
&s;ome Months in a perfect Tranquillity; to which
an Illne&s;s the Marquis was &s;eized with, and
which was, from the fir&s;t, thought to be dan|gerous
gave a &s;ad Interruption.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI>'s extreme Tenderne&s;s upon this Oc|ca&s;ion,
her anxious Solicitude, her pious Cares,
and never-cea&s;ing Attendance at the Bed&s;ide of
her &s;ick Father, were &s;o many new Charms,
<PB N="85" REF="101">
that engaged the Affection of <HI>Glanville</HI> more
&s;trongly. As the Marquis's Indi&s;po&s;ition in|crea&s;ed,
&s;o did her Care and Affiduity: She would
not allow any one to give him any thing but her|&s;elf;
bore all the petti&s;h Humours of a &s;ick Man
with a &s;urpri&s;ing Sweetne&s;s and Patience; watched
whole Nights, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, by his Bed&s;ide; and
when, at his Importunity, &s;he con&s;ented to take
any Re&s;t, it was only upon a Couch in his
Chamber, from whence no Intreaties could
make her remove. Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> partook with
her in the&s;e Fatigues; and, by his Care of her
Father, and Tenderne&s;s for her, confirmed her
in the E&s;teem &s;he had entertained of him.</P>
<P>The Marquis, who had &s;truggled with the Vi|olence
of his Di&s;temper for a Fortnight, died
on the Fifteenth Day in the Arms of <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who received his la&s;t Looks; his Eyes never re|moving
them&s;elves from her Face, till they were
clo&s;ed by Death. Her Spirits, which the De|&s;ire
&s;he had of being u&s;eful to him, had alone
&s;upported, now failed her at once; and &s;he fell
upon the Bed, without Sen&s;e or Motion, as &s;oon
as &s;he &s;aw him expire.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was kneeling on the other
Side, and had been holding one of his Uncle's
Hands, &s;tarted up in the mo&s;t terrible Con&s;ter|nation,
and, &s;eeing the Condition &s;he was in,
flew to her Relief: Her Women, while he &s;up|ported
her, u&s;ed all the Endeavours they could
think of to recover her; but &s;he continued &s;o
long in her Swoon, that they apprehended &s;he
was dead; and <HI>Glanville</HI> was re&s;igning him&s;elf
up to the mo&s;t bitter Sorrow, when &s;he opened
her Eyes; but it was only to clo&s;e them again.
<PB N="86" REF="102">
Her Faintings continued the whole Day; and
the Phy&s;icians declaring &s;he was in great Danger,
from her extreme Weakne&s;s, &s;he was carried
to Bed in a Condition that &s;eemed to promi&s;e
very little Hopes of her Life.</P>
<P>The Care of the Marquis's Funeral devolving
upon Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger expre&s;s
for his Father, who was appointed Guardian
to Lady <HI>Bella;</HI> the Marquis having fir&s;t a&s;ked
her if &s;he was willing it &s;hould be &s;o. This
Gentleman arrived Time enough to be Witne&s;s
of that &s;ad Ceremony, which was performed
with a Magnificence &s;uitable to the Birth and
Fortune of the Marquis.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bella</HI> kept her Bed &s;everal Days, and
her Life was thought to be in Danger; but her
Youth, and the Strength of her Con&s;titution,
overcame her Di&s;ea&s;e; and, when &s;he was &s;o
well recovered as to be able to admit of a Vi&s;it
from her Uncle, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;ent for Permi&s;|&s;ion
to introduce him: The afflicted <HI>Arabella</HI>
granted his Reque&s;t; but, being then more in|di&s;po&s;ed

their Vi&s;it for an Hour or two, which they
complied with; and, returning at the appointed
Time, were conducted into her Dre&s;&s;ing-Room
by <HI>Lucy,</HI> who informed them her Lady was ju&s;t
fallen into a Slumber.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had not &s;een her for
&s;ome Days, expected her waking with great
Impatience; and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with de&s;cribing
her, with a Lover's Fondne&s;s, to his Father,

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which treats of a con&s;olatory Vi&s;it, and
other grave Matters.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> being then awaked from her
Slumber, was indulging her Grief by Com|plaints,
which her Women were &s;o u&s;ed to hear,
that they never offered to di&s;turb her. Merci|le&s;s
Fate! &s;aid &s;he, in the mo&s;t moving Tone
imaginable, Cruel De&s;tiny! that, not contented
with having deprived my Infancy of the &s;oft
Cares, and tender Indulgences, of a Mother's
Fondne&s;s, has robbed me of the only Parent I
had left, and expo&s;ed me, at the&s;e early Years,
to the Grief of lo&s;ing him, who was not only
my Father, but my Friend, and Protector of
my Youth!</P>
<P>Then, pau&s;ing a Moment, &s;he renewed her
Complaints with a deep Sigh: Dear Relics of
the be&s;t of Fathers! pur&s;ued &s;he, Why was it
not permitted me to bathe you with my Tears?
Why were tho&s;e &s;acred Remains of him, from
whom I drew my Life, &s;natched from my Eyes,
ere they had poured their Tribute of Sorrow
over them? Ah! pitile&s;s Women! &s;aid &s;he to
her Attendants, you prevented me from per|forming
the la&s;t pious Rites to my dear Father!
You, by your cruel Care, hindered me from
ea&s;ing my &s;ad Heart, by paying him the la&s;t
Duties he could receive from me! Pardon, O
dear and &s;acred Shade of my loved Father!
pardon this unwilling Neglect of thy afflicted
<PB N="88" REF="104">
Child, who, to the la&s;t Moment of her wretched
Life, will bewail thy Lo&s;s!</P>
<P>Here &s;he cea&s;ed &s;peaking; and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
whom this Soliloquy had much le&s;s confounded
than his Father, was preparing to go in, and
comfort her; when the old Gentleman &s;topping
him with a Look of great Concern: My Niece
is certainly much wor&s;e than we apprehend,
&s;aid he: She is in a Delirium: Our Pre&s;ence may,
perhaps, di&s;compo&s;e her too much.</P>
<P>No, Sir, replied <HI>Glanville,</HI> extremely con|fu&s;ed
at this Su&s;picion; my Cou&s;in is not &s;o bad
as you &s;uppo&s;e: It is common enough for Peo|ple
in any great Affliction to ea&s;e them&s;elves by
Complaints.</P>
<P>But the&s;e, replied the Knight, are the &s;trange&s;t
Complaints I ever heard, and &s;avour &s;o much of
Phren&s;y, that I am per&s;uaded her Head is not
quite right.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville</HI> was going to reply, when <HI>Lucy,</HI> en|tering,
told them her Lady had ordered their
Admi&s;&s;ion: Upon which they followed her into
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Chamber, who was lying negli|gently
upon her Bed.</P>
<P>Her deep Mourning, and the black Gaw&s;e,
which covered Part of her fair Face, was &s;o ad|vantageous
to her Shape and Complexion, that
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who had not &s;een her &s;ince &s;he grew
up, was &s;truck with an extreme Surprize at her
Beauty, while his Son was gazing on her &s;o
pa&s;&s;ionately, that he never thought of introducing
his Father to her, who contemplated her with
as much Admiration as his Son, though with le&s;s
Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="105">
<HI>Arabella,</HI> ri&s;ing from her Bed, &s;aluted her
Uncle with a Grace that wholly charmed him;
and, turning to receive Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;he bur&s;t
into Tears at the Remembrance of his having
a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in her la&s;t Attendance upon her Fa|ther.
Alas! Sir, &s;aid &s;he, when we &s;aw each
other la&s;t, we were both engaged, in a very
melancholy Office: Had it plea&s;ed Heaven to
have &s;pared my Father, he would, doubtle&s;s,
have been extremely &s;en&s;ible of your generous
Cares; nor &s;hall you have any Rea&s;on to accu&s;e
me of Ingratitude, &s;ince I &s;hall always acknow|lege
your Kindne&s;s as I ought.</P>
<P>If you think you owe me any Obligation, re|turned
<HI>Glanville,</HI> pay me, deare&s;t Cou&s;in, by
moderating your Sorrow: Indeed your &s;uffer
your&s;elf to &s;ink too much under an Affliction
which is impo&s;&s;ible to be remedied.</P>
<P>Alas! an&s;wered <HI>Arabella,</HI> my Grief is very
&s;light, compared to that of many others upon
the Death of their Relations: The Great <HI>Sy&s;i|gambis,</HI>
who, que&s;tionle&s;s, wanted neither For|titude
nor Courage, upon the News of her
Grand-daughter's Death, wrapt her&s;elf up in her
Veil; and, re&s;olving never more to behold the
Light, waited for Death in that Po&s;ture.</P>
<P><HI>Menecrates,</HI> upon the Lo&s;s of his Wife, built
a magnificent Tomb for her; and, &s;hutting him|&s;elf
up in it, re&s;olved to pa&s;s away the Remain|der
of his Life with her A&s;hes. The&s;e, in|deed,
were glorious Effects of Piety and Affec|tion,
and unfeigned Signs of an exce&s;&s;ive Sor|row:
What are the few Tears I &s;hed to &s;uch
illu&s;trious In&s;tances of Grief and Affection, as
the&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="106">
<HI>Glanville,</HI> finding his Cou&s;in upon this Strain,
blu&s;hed extremely, and would have changed the
Subject; but the old Gentleman, who had never
heard of the&s;e two Per&s;ons &s;he mentioned, who
expre&s;&s;ed their Sorrow for their Lo&s;&s;es in &s;o
&s;trange a Manner, was &s;urpri&s;ed at it; and was
re&s;olved to know more about them.</P>
<P>Pray, Niece, &s;aid he, were you acquainted
with the&s;e People, who could not &s;ubmit to the
Di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, but, as one may
&s;ay, flew in the Face of Heaven by their Impa|tience?</P>
<P>I am very well acquainted with their Hi&s;tory,
re&s;umed <HI>Arabella;</HI> and I can a&s;&s;ure you, they
were both very admirable Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Oh! Oh! their Hi&s;tory! interrupted the
Knight! What, I warrant you, they are to be
found in the <HI>Fairy Tales,</HI> and tho&s;e &s;ort of Books!
Well, I never could like &s;uch Romances, not
I; for they only &s;poil Youth, and put &s;trange
Notions into their Heads.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> blu&s;hing with
Anger, that we are like to differ in Opinion
upon &s;o important a Point.</P>
<P>Truly, Niece, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> if we never
differ in any thing el&s;e, I &s;hall be very ea&s;y about
this &s;light Matter; tho' I think a young Lady
of your fine Sen&s;e (for my Son prai&s;es you to
the Skies for your <HI>Wit</HI>) &s;hould not be &s;o fond
of &s;uch ridiculous Non&s;en&s;e as the&s;e Story-Books
are filled with.</P>
<P>Upon my Word, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> all the
Re&s;pect I owe you cannot hinder me from tell|ing
you, that I take it extremely ill you &s;hould,
in my Pre&s;ence, rail at the fine&s;t Productions in
<PB N="91" REF="107">
the World: I think, we are infinitely obliged
to the&s;e Authors, who have, in &s;o &s;ublime a Style,
delivered down to Po&s;terity the heroic Actions
of the brave&s;t Men, and mo&s;t virtuous of Wo|men:
But for the inimitable Pen of the famous
<HI>Scudery,</HI> we had been ignorant of the Lives of
many great and illu&s;trious Per&s;ons: The war|like
Actions of <HI>Oroondates, Aronces, Juba,</HI> and
the renowned <HI>Artaban,</HI> had, haply, never been
talked of in our Age; and tho&s;e fair and cha&s;te
Ladies, who were the Objects of their pure and
con&s;tant Pa&s;&s;ions, had &s;till been buried in Ob&s;cu|rity;
and neither their divine Beauties, or &s;in|gular
Virtue, been the Subject of our Admira|tion
and Prai&s;e. But for the famous <HI>Scudery,</HI>
we had not known the true Cau&s;e of that Action
of <HI>Clelia</HI>'s, for which the Senate decreed her a
Statue; namely, Her ca&s;ting her&s;elf, with an
unparalleled Courage, into the <HI>Tyber,</HI> a deep
and rapid River, as you mu&s;t certainly know,
and &s;wimming to the other Side. It was not, as
the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians fal&s;ly report, a Stratagem to
recover her&s;elf, and the other Ho&s;tages, from the
Power of <HI>Por&s;ena;</HI> it was to pre&s;erve her Ho|nour
from Violation by the impious <HI>Sextus,</HI>
who was in the Camp. But for <HI>Scudery,</HI> we had
&s;till thought the inimitable Poete&s;s <HI>Sappho</HI> to be
a loo&s;e Wanton, who&s;e Ver&s;es breathed nothing
but uncha&s;te and irregular Fires: On the con|trary,
&s;he was &s;o remarkably cha&s;te, that &s;he
would never even con&s;ent to marry; but, loving
<HI>Phaon,</HI> only with a Platonic Pa&s;&s;ion, obliged
him to re&s;train his De&s;ires within the Compa&s;s
of a Brother's Affection. Numberle&s;s are the
Mi&s;takes he has cleared up of this Kind; and
<PB N="92" REF="108">
I que&s;tion, if any other Hi&s;torian, but him&s;elf,
knew that <HI>Cleopatra</HI> was really married to <HI>Julius
Cae&s;ar;</HI> or that <HI>Cae&s;ario,</HI> her Son by this Mar|riage,
was not murdered, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, by
the Order of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> but married the fair
Queen of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> in who&s;e Dominions he took
Refuge. The prodigious Acts of Valour, which
he has recounted of tho&s;e accompli&s;hed Princes,
have never been equalled by the Heroes of either
the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians: How poor and
in&s;ignificant are the Actions of their Warriors
to <HI>Scudery</HI>'s, where one of tho&s;e admirable He|roes
would put whole Armies into Terror, and
with his &s;ingle Arm oppo&s;e a Legion!</P>
<P>Indeed, Niece, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> no longer
able to forbear interrupting her, the&s;e are all
very improbable Tales. I remember, when I
was a Boy, I was very fond of reading the Hi|&s;tory
of <HI>Jack the Giant killer,</HI> and <HI>Tom Thumb;</HI>
and the&s;e Stories &s;o filled my Head, that I really
thought one of tho&s;e little Heroes killed Men an
hundred Feet high; and that the other, after a
great many &s;urpri&s;ing Exploits, was &s;wallowed
up by a Cow.</P>
<P>You was very young, Sir, you &s;ay, interrupted
<HI>Arabella</HI> tartly, when tho&s;e Stories gained your
Belief: However, your Judgment was certainly
younger, if you ever believed them at all; for
as credulous as you are plea&s;ed to think me, I
&s;hould never, at any Age, have been per&s;uaded
&s;uch Things could have happened.</P>
<P>My Father, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was &s;trangely confu&s;ed all this Time, bore Arms
in his Youth; and Soldiers, you know, never
trouble them&s;elves much with reading.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="109">
Has my Uncle been a Soldier, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
and does he hold in Contempt the Actions of
the brave&s;t Soldiers in the World?</P>
<P>The Soldiers you &s;peak of, Niece, &s;aid Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> were indeed the brave&s;t Soldiers in
the World; for I don't believe, they ever had
their Equals.</P>
<P>And yet, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> there are a great
Number of &s;uch Soldiers to be found in <HI>Scudery.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, my dear Niece, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
they are to be found no-where el&s;e, except in
your Imagination, which, I am &s;orry to &s;ee, is
filled with &s;uch <HI>Whim&s;ies.</HI></P>
<P>If you mean this to affront me, Sir, re&s;umed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> hardly able to forbear Tears, I know
how far, as my Uncle, I ought to bear with
you: But, methinks, it is highly unkind to ag|gravate
my Sorrows by &s;uch cruel Je&s;ts; and,
&s;ince I am not in an Humour to &s;uffer them,
don't take it ill, if I intreat you to leave me to
my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who knew nothing plea&s;ed his
Cou&s;in &s;o much as paying an exact Obedience
to her Commands, ro&s;e up immediately; and,
bowing re&s;pectfully to her, a&s;ked his Father, If
he &s;hould attend him into the Gardens?</P>
<P>The Baronet, who thought <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Beha|viour
bordered a good deal upon Rudene&s;s, took
his Leave with &s;ome Signs of Di&s;plea&s;ure upon
his Countenance; and, notwith&s;tanding all his
Son could &s;ay in Excu&s;e for her, he was ex|tremely
offended.</P>
<P>What, &s;aid he, to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> does &s;he
&s;o little under&s;tand the Re&s;pect that is due to me
as her Uncle, that &s;he, &s;o peremptorily, de&s;ired
<PB N="94" REF="110">
me to leave her Room? My Brother was to
blame to take &s;o little Care of her Education;
&s;he is quite a Ru&s;tic!</P>
<P>Ah! don't wrong your Judgment &s;o much,
Sir, &s;aid <HI>Glanville;</HI> my Cou&s;in has as little of
the Ru&s;tic as if &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed all her Life in a
Court: Her fine Sen&s;e, and the native Elegance
of her Manners give an inimitable Grace to her
Behaviour; and as much exceed the &s;tudied Po|litene&s;s
of other Ladies I have conver&s;ed with,
as the Beauties of her Per&s;on do all I have ever
&s;een.</P>
<P>She is very hand&s;ome, I confe&s;s, returned Sir
<HI>Charles;</HI> but I cannot think &s;o well of her <HI>Wit</HI>
as you do; for methinks &s;he talks very oddly,
and has the &s;trange&s;t Conceits! Who, but her|&s;elf,
would think it probable, that one Man
could put a whole Army to Flight; or commend
a fooli&s;h Fellow for living in a Tomb, becau&s;e
his Wife was buried in it? Fie, fie! the&s;e are
&s;illy and extravagant Notions, and will make
her appear very ridiculous.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Ju&s;tne&s;s
of this Remark, that he could not help &s;ighing;
which his Father ob&s;erving, told him, That,
&s;ince &s;he was to be his Wife, it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s
to produce a Reformation in her; for, added
he, notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e Fortune &s;he
will bring you, I &s;hould be &s;orry to have a
Daughter-in-law, for whom I &s;hould blu&s;h as
often as &s;he opens her Mouth.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> I have
but very little Hopes, that I &s;hall be &s;o happy as
to have my Cou&s;in for a Wife; for, tho' it was
my Uncle's Command I &s;hould make my Ad|dre&s;&s;es
<PB N="95" REF="111">
to her, &s;he received me &s;o ill, as a Lover,
that I have never dared to talk to her upon that
Subject &s;ince.</P>
<P>And pray, re&s;umed Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> upon what
Terms are you at pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>While I &s;eem to pretend nothing to her, as a
Lover, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;he is very obli|ging,
and we live in great Harmony together;
but I am per&s;uaded, if I exceed the Bounds of
Friend&s;hip in my Profe&s;&s;ions, &s;he will treat me
extremely ill.</P>
<P>But, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> when &s;he &s;hall
know, that her Father has bequeathed you one
Third of his E&s;tate, provided &s;he don't marry
you, 'tis probable her Mind may change; and
you may depend upon it, &s;ince your Heart is &s;o
much &s;et upon her, that, as I am her Guardian,
I &s;hall pre&s;s her to perform the Marquis's Will.</P>
<P>Ah! Sir, re&s;umed Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> never at|tempt
to lay any Con&s;traint upon my Cou&s;in in
an Affair of this Nature: Permit me to tell you,
it would be an Abu&s;e of the Marquis's generous
Confidence, and what I would never &s;ubmit
to.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, &s;aid the old Gentleman, you have
no Rea&s;on to fear any Compul&s;ion from me:
Tho' her Father has left me her Guardian, till
&s;he is of Age, yet it is with &s;uch Re&s;triction,
that my Niece is quite her own Mi&s;tre&s;s in that
Re&s;pect; for tho' &s;he is directed to con&s;ult me
in her Choice of an Hu&s;band, yet my Con&s;ent
is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The Marquis has
certainly had a great Opinion of his Daughter's
Prudence; and I hope, &s;he will prove her&s;elf
worthy of it by her Conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="112">
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was &s;o taken up with his Re|flections
upon the State of his Affairs, that he
made but little Reply; and, as &s;oon as he had
di&s;engaged him&s;elf, retired to his Chamber, to
be at more Liberty to indulge his Meditations.
As he could not flatter him&s;elf, with having
made any Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Heart of <HI>Arabella,</HI>
he fore&s;aw a thou&s;and Incoveniences from the
Death of the Marquis; for, be&s;ides that he lo&s;t
a powerful Mediator with his Cou&s;in, he feared
that, when &s;he appeared in the World, her
Beauty and Fortune would attract a Croud of
Admirers, among whom, it was probable, &s;he
would find &s;ome one more agreeable to her
Ta&s;te than him&s;elf. As he loved her with great
Tenderne&s;s, this Thought made him extremely
unea&s;y; and he would &s;ometimes wi&s;h the Mar|quis
had laid a &s;tronger Injunction upon her in
his Will to marry him; and regretted the little
Power his Father had over her: But he was too
generous, to dwell long upon the&s;e Thoughts,
and contented him&s;elf with doing all that was
honourable to obtain her, without &s;eeking for
any A&s;&s;i&s;tance from unju&s;tifiable Methods.</P>

<ARGUMENT>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> in a few Days, leaving her
Chamber, had &s;o many Opportunities of
charming her Uncle by her Conver&s;ation,
<PB N="97" REF="113">
which, when it did not turn upon any Incident
in her Romances, was perfectly fine, ea&s;y, and
entertaining, that he declared, he &s;hould quit
the Ca&s;tle with great Regret; and endeavoured
to per&s;uade her to accompany him to Town:
But <HI>Arabella,</HI> who was determined to pa&s;s the
Year of her Mourning, in the Retirement &s;he
had always lived in, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, &s;trong
as her Curio&s;ity was, to &s;ee <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;ecretly rejoiced at this Re&s;olu|tion,
tho' he &s;eemed de&s;irous of making her
change it; but &s;he was unalterable; and, there|fore,
the Baronet did not think proper to pre&s;s
her any more.</P>
<P>Her Father's Will being read to her, &s;he
&s;eemed extremely plea&s;ed with the Articles in fa|vour
of Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> wi&s;hing him Joy of the
E&s;tate that was bequeathed to him, with a mo&s;t
inchanting Sweetne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;ighed, and ca&s;t his Eyes on
the Ground, as he returned her Compliment,
with a very low Bow; and Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> ob&s;erv|ing
his Confu&s;ion, told <HI>Arabella,</HI> that he thought
it was a very bad Omen for his Son, to wi&s;h
him Joy of an E&s;tate, which he could not come to
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, but by a very great Misfortune.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> under&s;tanding his Meaning, blu&s;hed;
and, willing to change the Di&s;cour&s;e, proceeded
to con&s;ult her Uncle upon the Regulation of her
Hou&s;e. Be&s;ides the Legacies her Father had
bequeathed to his Servants, tho&s;e, who were
more immediately about his Per&s;on, &s;he de&s;ired,
might have their Salaries continued to them:
She made no other Alteration, than di&s;charging
the&s;e Attendants, retaining all the others; and
<PB N="98" REF="114">
&s;ubmitting to her Uncle the Management of her
E&s;tates, receiving the Allowance he thought
proper to a&s;&s;ign her, till &s;he was of Age, of
which &s;he wanted three Years.</P>
<P>Every Thing being &s;ettled, Sir <HI>Charles</HI> pre|pared
to return to Town. Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
de&s;ired nothing &s;o much as to &s;tay &s;ome time
longer with his Cou&s;in in her Solitude, got his
Father to intreat that Favour for him of <HI>Ara|bella:</HI>
But &s;he repre&s;ented to her Uncle the Im|propriety
of a young Gentleman's &s;taying with
her, in her Hou&s;e, now her Father was dead,
in a manner &s;o genteel and convincing, that
Sir <HI>Charles</HI> could pre&s;s it no further; and all
that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> could obtain, was, a Permi&s;|&s;ion
to vi&s;it her &s;ome time after, provided he
could prevail upon his Si&s;ter, Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte
Glanville,</HI> to accompany him.</P>
<P>The Day of their Departure being come, Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> took his Leave of his charming Niece,
with many Expre&s;&s;ions of E&s;teem and Affection;
and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> appeared &s;o concerned, that
<HI>Arabella</HI> could not help ob&s;erving it; and bade
him adieu with great Sweetne&s;s.</P>
<P>When they were gone, &s;he found her Time
hung heavy upon her Hands; her Father was
continually in her Thoughts, and made her ex|tremely
melancholy: She recollected the many
agreeable Conver&s;ations &s;he had had with <HI>Glan|ville;</HI>
and wi&s;hed it had been con&s;i&s;tent with
Decency to have detained him. Her Books
being the only Amu&s;ement &s;he had left, &s;he ap|plied
her&s;elf to reading with more Eagerne&s;s
than ever; but, notwith&s;tanding the Delight
&s;he took in this Employment, &s;he had &s;o many
Hours of Solitude and Melancholy to indulge
<PB N="99" REF="115">
the Remembrance of her Father in, that &s;he
was very far from being happy.</P>
<P>As &s;he wi&s;hed for nothing more pa&s;&s;ionately
than an agreeable Companion of her own Sex
and Rank, an Accident threw a Per&s;on in her
Way, who, for &s;ome Days, afforded her a little
Amu&s;ement. Stepping one Day out of her Coach,
to go into Church, &s;he &s;aw a young Lady enter,
accompanied with a middle-aged Woman, who
&s;eemed to be an Attendant. As <HI>Arabella</HI> had
never &s;een any one, above the Rank of a Gen|tleman
Farmer's Daughter, in this Church, her
Attention was immediately engaged by the Ap|pearance
of this Stranger, who was very mag|nificently
dre&s;&s;ed: Tho' &s;he did not &s;eem to be
more than eighteen Years of Age, her Statute
was above the ordinary Size of Women; and,
being rather too plump to be delicate, her Mien
was &s;o maje&s;tic, and &s;uch an Air of Grandeur
was diffu&s;ed over her whole Per&s;on, joined to
the Charms of a very lovely Face, that <HI>Arabella</HI>
could hardly help thinking &s;he &s;aw the beautiful
<HI>Candace</HI> before her, who, by <HI>Scudery</HI>'s De&s;crip|tion,
very much re&s;embled this Fair one.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> having heedfully ob&s;erved her Looks,
thought &s;he &s;aw a great Appearance of Melan|choly
in her Eyes, which filled her with a gene|rous
Concern for the Misfortunes of &s;o admira|ble
a Per&s;on; but, the Service beginning, &s;he
was not at Liberty to indulge her Reflections
upon this Occa&s;ion, as &s;he never &s;uffered any
Thoughts, but tho&s;e of Religion, to intrude
upon her Mind, during the&s;e pious Rites.</P>
<P>As &s;he was going out of Church &s;he ob&s;erved
the young Lady, attended only with the Wo|man
who came with her, preparing to walk
<PB N="100" REF="116">
home, and therefore &s;tept forward, and, &s;alu|ting
her with a Grace peculiar to her&s;elf, in|treated
her to come into her Coach, and give
her the Plea&s;ure of &s;etting her down at her own
Hou&s;e: So obliging an Offer from a Per&s;on of
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Rank could not fail of being received
with great Re&s;pect by the young Lady, who was
not ignorant of all the Forms of Good-breeding;
and, accepting her Invitation, &s;he &s;tepped into
the Coach; <HI>Arabella</HI> obliging her Woman to
come in al&s;o, for whom, as &s;he had that Day only
<HI>Lucy</HI> along with her, there was Room enough.</P>
<P>As they were going home, <HI>Arabella,</HI> who
longed to be better acquainted, intreated the
fair Stranger, as &s;he called her, to go to the Ca|&s;tle,
and &s;pend the Day with her; and &s;he con|&s;enting,
they pa&s;&s;ed by the Hou&s;e where &s;he
lodged, and alighted at the Ca&s;tle, where <HI>Ara|bella</HI>
welcomed her, with the mo&s;t obliging Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of Civility and Re&s;pect. The young
Lady, tho' perfectly ver&s;ed in the Modes of
Town-Breeding, and <HI>nothing-meaning</HI> Ceremo|ny,
was at a Lo&s;s how to make proper Returns
to the Civilities of <HI>Arabella:</HI> The native Elegance
and Simplicity of her Manners were accompa|nied
with &s;o much real Benevolence of Heart,
&s;uch in&s;inuating Tenderne&s;s, and Graces &s;o ir|re&s;i&s;tible,
that &s;he was quite oppre&s;&s;ed with
them; and, having &s;pent mo&s;t of her Time be|tween
her Toilet and Quadrille, was &s;o little
qualified for partaking a Conver&s;ation &s;o refined
as <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, that her Di&s;cour&s;e appeared quite
tedious to her, &s;ince it was neither upon Fa|&s;hions,
A&s;&s;emblies, Cards, or Scandal.</P>
<P>Her Silence, and that Ab&s;ence of Mind, which
&s;he betrayed, made <HI>Arabella</HI> conclude, &s;he was
<PB N="101" REF="117">
under &s;ome very great Affliction; and, to amu&s;e
her after Dinner, led her into the Gardens, &s;up|po&s;ing
a Per&s;on, who&s;e Unea&s;ine&s;s, as &s;he did
not doubt, proceeded from Love, would be
plea&s;ed with the Sight of Groves and Streams,
and be tempted to di&s;clo&s;e her Misfortunes,
while they wandered in that agreeable Privacy.
In this, however, &s;he was deceived; for, tho' the
young Lady &s;ighed &s;everal times, yet, when &s;he
did &s;peak, it was only of indifferent Things, and
not at all in the manner of an afflicted Heroine.</P>
<P>After ob&s;erving upon a thou&s;and Trifles, &s;he
told <HI>Arabella</HI> at la&s;t, to whom &s;he was de&s;irous
of making known her Alliance to Quality, that
the&s;e Gardens were extremely like tho&s;e of her
Father's-in-Law, the Duke of&mdash;at&mdash;</P>
<P>At this Intimation, &s;he expected <HI>Arabella</HI>
would be extremely &s;urpri&s;ed; but that Lady,
who&s;e Thoughts were always familiarized to Ob|jects
of Grandeur, and would not have been
a&s;toni&s;hed, if &s;he had under&s;tood her Gue&s;t was
the Daughter of a King, appeared &s;o little moved,
that the Lady was piqued by her Indifference;
and, after a few Moment's Silence, began to
mention going away.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who was de&s;irous of retaining her a
few Days, intreated her &s;o obligingly to favour
her with her Company, for &s;ome time, in her
Solitude, that the other could not refu&s;e; and,
di&s;patching her Woman to the Hou&s;e where &s;he
lodged, to inform them of her Stay at the Ca&s;tle,
would have di&s;pen&s;ed with her coming again to
attend her, had not <HI>Arabella</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon the
contrary.</P>
<P>The Re&s;erve, which the Daughter-in-Law
of the Duke of&mdash;&s;till continued to maintain,
<PB N="102" REF="118">
notwith&s;tanding the repeated Expre&s;&s;ions of
Friend&s;hip <HI>Arabella</HI> u&s;ed to her, increa&s;ed her
Curio&s;ity to know her Adventures, which &s;he
was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;he had never offered
to relate; but, attributing her Silence, upon this
Head, to her Mode&s;ty, &s;he was re&s;olved, as was
the Cu&s;tom in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, to oblige her Wo|man,
who, &s;he pre&s;umed, was her Confidante,
to relate, her Lady's Hi&s;tory to her; and &s;end|ing
for this Per&s;on one Day, when &s;he was
alone, to attend her in her Clo&s;et, &s;he gave
Orders to her Women, if the fair Stranger came
to inquire for her, to &s;ay &s;he was then bu&s;y, but
would wait on her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>After this Caution, &s;he ordered Mrs. <HI>Morris</HI>
to be admitted; and, obliging her to &s;it down,
told her, &s;he &s;ent for her in order to hear from
her the Hi&s;tory of her Lady's Life, which &s;he
was extremely de&s;irous of knowing.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> who was a Per&s;on of Sen&s;e,
and had &s;een the World, was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed
at this Reque&s;t of <HI>Arabella,</HI> which was quite
contrary to the Laws of Good-breeding; and,
as &s;he thought, betrayed a great deal of imperti|nent
Curio&s;ity: She could not tell how to account
for the free Manner in which &s;he de&s;ired her to
give up her Lady's Secrets, which, indeed, were
not of a Nature to be told; and appeared &s;o
much confu&s;ed, that <HI>Arabella</HI> took Notice of it;
and, &s;uppo&s;ing it was her Ba&s;hfulne&s;s which
cau&s;ed her Embarra&s;&s;ment, &s;he endeavoured to
re-a&s;&s;ure her by the mo&s;t affable Behaviour ima|ginable.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> who was not capable of much
Fidelity for her Lady, being but lately taken
<PB N="103" REF="119">
into her Service, and not extremely fond of her,
thought &s;he had now a fine Opportunity of re|commending
her&s;elf to <HI>Arabella,</HI> by telling her
all &s;he knew of Mi&s;s <HI>Groves,</HI> for that was her
Name; and, therefore, told her, &s;ince &s;he was
plea&s;ed to command it, &s;he would give her what
Account &s;he was able of her Lady; but in|treated
her to be &s;ecret, becau&s;e it was of great
Con&s;equence to her, that her Affairs &s;hould not
be known.</P>
<P>I always imagined, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> that your
beautiful Mi&s;tre&s;s had &s;ome particular Rea&s;on
for not making her&s;elf known, and for coming
in this private Manner into this Part of the
Country: You may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf therefore,
that I will protect her as far as I am able, and
offer her all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance in my Power to give
her: Therefore you may acquaint me with her
Adventures, without being apprehen&s;ive of a
Di&s;covery that would be prejudicial to her.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> who had been much better
plea&s;ed with the A&s;&s;urances of a Reward for the
Intelligence &s;he was going to give her, looked
a little fooli&s;h at the&s;e fine Promi&s;es, in which &s;he
had no Share; and <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he was
endeavouring to recollect all the Pa&s;&s;ages of her
Lady's Life, told her, She need not give her&s;elf
the Trouble to acquaint her with any thing that
pa&s;&s;ed during the Infancy of her Lady, but pro|ceed
to acquaint her with Matters of greater Im|portance:
And &s;ince, &s;aid &s;he, you have, no
doubt, been mo&s;t favoured with her Confidence,
you will do me a Plea&s;ure to de&s;cribe to me, ex|actly,
all the Thoughts of her Soul, as &s;he has
communicated them to you, that I may the
better comprehend her Hi&s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of Mi&s;s Groves, inter&s;per&s;ed
with &s;ome very curious Ob&s;ervations.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOUGH, Madam, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI>
I have not been long in Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI>'s Ser|vice,
yet I know a great many Things by the
means of her former Woman, who told them
to me, tho' my Lady thinks I am ignorant of
them; and I know that this is her &s;econd Trip
into the Country.</P>
<P>Pray, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> do me the Fa|vour
to relate Things methodically: Of what
U&s;e is it to me to know that this is your Lady's
&s;econd Trip, as you call it, into the Country,
if I know not the Occa&s;ion of it? Therefore be|gin
with informing me, who were the Parents
of this admirable young Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Her Father, Madam, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> was
a Merchant; and, at his Death, left her a large
Fortune, and &s;o con&s;iderable a Jointure to his
Wife, that the Duke of&mdash;, being then a Wi|dower,
was tempted to make his Addre&s;&s;es to
her. Mrs. <HI>Groves</HI> was one of the proude&s;t Wo|men
in the World; and, this Offer flattering
her Ambition more than ever &s;he had Rea&s;on to
expect, &s;he married the Duke after a very &s;hort
Court&s;hip; and carried Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> down with
her to&mdash;, where the Duke had a fine Seat,
and where &s;he was received by his Grace's
Daughters, who were much about her own Age,
with great Civility. Mi&s;s <HI>Groves,</HI> Madam, was
then about twelve Years old, and was educated
<PB N="105" REF="121">
with the Duke's Daughters, who, in a little
time, became quite di&s;gu&s;ted with their new
Si&s;ter; for Mi&s;s <HI>Groves,</HI> who inherited her Mo|ther's
Pride, tho' not her Under&s;tanding, in all
things affected an Equality with tho&s;e young
Ladies, who, con&s;cious of the Superiority of
their Birth, could but ill bear with her In&s;olence
and Pre&s;umption. As they grew older, the Dif|ference
of their Inclinations cau&s;ed perpetual
Quarrels among&s;t them; for his Grace's Daugh|ters
were &s;erious, re&s;erved, and pious. Mi&s;s
<HI>Groves</HI> affected noi&s;y Mirth, was a great Romp,
and delighted in ma&s;culine Exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>The Duche&s;s was often reflected on for &s;uf|fering
her Daughter, without any other Com|pany
than two or three Servants, to &s;pend great
Part of the Day in riding about the Country,
leaping over Hedges and Ditches, expo&s;ing her
fair Face to the Injuries of the Sun and Wind;
and, by tho&s;e coar&s;e Exerci&s;es, contracting a
ma&s;culine and robu&s;t Air not becoming her Sex,
and tender Years: Yet &s;he could not be prevailed
upon to re&s;train her from this Diver&s;ion, till it
was reported, &s;he had li&s;tened to the Addre&s;&s;es
of a young Sport&s;man, who u&s;ed to mix in her
Train, when &s;he went upon tho&s;e Rambles, and
procured frequent Opportunities of conver&s;ing
with her.</P>
<P>There is a great Difference, interrupted <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
in &s;uffering Addre&s;&s;es, and being betrayed
into an involuntary Hearing of them, and this
la&s;t, I conceive to have been the Ca&s;e of your
Lady; for it is not very probable, &s;he would
&s;o far forget what &s;he owed to her own Glory,
<PB N="106" REF="122">
as to be induced to li&s;ten quietly to Di&s;cour&s;es
like tho&s;e you mention.</P>
<P>However, Madam, re&s;umed Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI>
the Duche&s;s thought it nece&s;&s;ary to keep her
more at home; but, even here, &s;he was not
without meeting Adventures, and found a Lo|ver
in the Per&s;on who taught her to write.</P>
<P>That, indeed, was a very notable Adventure,
&s;aid <HI>Arabella;</HI> but it is not &s;trange, that Love
&s;hould produce &s;uch Metamorpho&s;es: 'Tis not
very long ago, that I heard of a Man of Qua|lity,
who di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in a poor Habit, and
worked in the Gardens of a certain Nobleman,
who&s;e Daughter he was enamoured with: The&s;e
things happen every Day.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on I &s;peak of, Madam, &s;aid Mrs.
<HI>Morris,</HI> was never di&s;covered to be any thing
better than a Writing-ma&s;ter; and yet, for all
that, Mi&s;s was <HI>&s;mitten</HI> with his fine Per&s;on, and
was taking Mea&s;ures to run away with him,
when the Intrigue was di&s;covered, the Lover
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the young Lady, who&s;e faulty
Conduct had drawn upon her her Mother's Di&s;|like,
was &s;ent up to <HI>London,</HI> and allowed to be
her own Mi&s;tre&s;s at Sixteen; to which unpar|donable
Neglect of her Mother &s;he owes the
Misfortunes that have &s;ince befallen her.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the common Opinion of
this Matter, interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> again, I am
per&s;uaded the Writing-ma&s;ter, as you call him,
was &s;ome Per&s;on of Quality, who made u&s;e of
that Device to get Acce&s;s to his beautiful Mi&s;tre&s;s.
Love is ingenious in Artifices: Who would
have thought, that, under the Name of <HI>Alcippus,</HI>
a &s;imple Attendant of the fair <HI>Artemi&s;a</HI> Prince&s;s
<PB N="107" REF="123">
of <HI>Armenia,</HI> the gallant <HI>Alexander</HI> Son of the great
and unfortunate <HI>Antony,</HI> by Queen <HI>Clcopatra,</HI>
was concealed, who took upon him&s;elf that
mean Condition for the &s;ake of &s;eeing his adored
Prince&s;s? Yet the Contrivance of <HI>Orontes,</HI> Prince
of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;agetes,</HI> was far more ingenious, and
even dangerous; for this valiant and young
Prince, happening to &s;ee the Picture of the beau|tiful
<HI>Thale&s;tris,</HI> Daughter of the Queen of the
<HI>Amazons,</HI> he fell pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with her;
and, knowing that the Entrance into that Coun|try
was forbid to Men, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in
Womens Apparel; and, finding means to be
introduced to the Queen, and her fair Daughter,
who&s;e Amity he gained by &s;ome very &s;ingular
Services in the Wars, he lived &s;everal Years un|di&s;covered
in their Court: I &s;ee, therefore, no
Rea&s;on to the contrary, but that this Writing-|master
might have been &s;ome illu&s;trious Per&s;on,
whom Love had di&s;gui&s;ed; and, I am per&s;uaded,
added &s;he, &s;miling, that I &s;hall hear more of him
anon, in a very different Character.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> whom
this Speech of <HI>Arabella</HI> had extremely &s;urpri&s;ed,
I never heard any thing more about him, than
what I have related; and, for what I know, he
continues &s;till to teach Writing; for I don't &s;up|po&s;e
the Duche&s;s's Di&s;plea&s;ure could affect
him.</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> that you
can &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an Offence to Probability? In
my Opinion, 'tis much more likely, that this
unfortunate Lover is dead thro' De&s;pair; or,
perhaps, wandering over the World in Search
<PB N="108" REF="124">
of that Fair one, who was &s;natched from his
Hopes.</P>
<P>If it was his De&s;ign to &s;eek for her, Madam,
re&s;umed Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> he need not have gone
far, &s;ince &s;he was only &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> whither
he might ea&s;ily have followed her.</P>
<P>There is no accounting for the&s;e Things, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella:</HI> Perhaps he has been impo&s;ed upon, and
made to believe, that it was &s;he her&s;elf that ba|ni&s;hed
him from her Pre&s;ence: 'Tis probable too,
that he was jealous, and thought &s;he preferred
&s;ome one of his Rivals to him. Jealou&s;y is in&s;epara|ble
from true Love; and the slighte&s;t Matters ima|ginable
will occa&s;ion it: And, what is &s;till more
wonderful, this Pa&s;&s;ion creates the greate&s;t Di&s;|orders
in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and delicate Hearts.
Never was there a more refined and faithful
Pa&s;&s;ion, than that of the renowned <HI>Artamenes</HI> for
<HI>Mandana;</HI> and yet this Prince was driven al|mo&s;t
to Di&s;traction by a Smile, which, he fan|&s;ied,
he &s;aw in the Face of his Divine Mi&s;tre&s;s,
at a time when &s;he had &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe
he was dead; and he was &s;o tran&s;ported with
Grief and Rage, that, tho' he was a Pri&s;oner in
his Enemy's Camp, where the Knowledge of his
Quality would have procured him certain Death,
yet he determined to hazard all Things for the
fake of pre&s;enting him&s;elf before <HI>Mandana,</HI> and
upbraiding her with her Infidelity; when, in
Reality, nothing was farther from the Thoughts
of that fair and virtuous Prince&s;s, than the Light|ne&s;s
he accu&s;ed her of: So that, as I &s;aid before,
it is not at all to be wondered at, if this di&s;gui&s;ed
Lover of your Lady was driven to De&s;pair by
Su&s;picions as groundle&s;s, perhaps, as tho&s;e of
<PB N="109" REF="125">
<HI>Artamenes,</HI> yet not the le&s;s cruel and torment|ing.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> finding <HI>Arabella</HI> held her Peace
at the&s;e Words, went on with her Hi&s;tory in
this manner:&mdash;Mi&s;s <HI>Groves,</HI> Madam, being
directed by her Woman in all things, took up
her Lodgings in her Father's Hou&s;e, who was a
broken Trade&s;man, and obliged to keep him&s;elf
concealed for fear of his Creditors: Here &s;he
formed her Equipage, which con&s;i&s;ted of a
Chair, one Footman, a Cook, and her Wo|man:
As &s;he was indulged with the Command
of what Money &s;he plea&s;ed, her Extravagance
was boundle&s;s: She lavi&s;hed away large Sums
at Gaming, which was her favourite Diver&s;ion;
kept &s;uch a Number of different Animals for
Favourites, that their Maintenance amounted
to a con&s;iderable Sum every Year: Her Wo|man's
whole Family were &s;upported at her Ex|pence;
and, as &s;he frequented all public Places,
and &s;urpa&s;&s;ed Ladies of the fir&s;t Quality in Fine|ry,
her Dre&s;s alone con&s;umed great Part of her
Income. I need not tell you, Madam, that my
Lady was a celebrated Beauty: You have your|&s;elf
been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that &s;he is very hand|&s;ome.
When &s;he fir&s;t appeared at Court, her
Beauty, and the uncommon Dignity of her Per|&s;on,
at &s;uch early Years, made her the Object
of general Admiration. The King was particu|larly
&s;truck with her; and declared to tho&s;e about
him, that Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> was the fine&s;t Woman
at Court. The Ladies, however, found means
to explain away all that was flattering in this
Di&s;tinction: They &s;aid, Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> was clum&s;y;
and it was her Re&s;emblance to the <HI>unwieldy Ger|man</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="126">
Ladies that made her &s;o much admired by
his Maje&s;ty. Her Pride, and the Quality Airs
&s;he affected, were the Subject of great Ridicule
to tho&s;e that envied her Charms: Some Cen|&s;ures
were maliciou&s;ly ca&s;t on her Birth; for,
as &s;he was always &s;tyled the Duche&s;s of&mdash;'s
Daughter, a Cu&s;tom &s;he introduced her&s;elf, &s;he
&s;eemed to di&s;claim all Title to a legal Father.
Mi&s;s <HI>Groves,</HI> as univer&s;ally admired as &s;he was,
yet made but very few particular Conque&s;ts.
Her Fortune was known to be very con&s;iderable,
and her Mother's Jointure was to de&s;cend to her
after her Death: Yet there was no Gentleman,
who would venture upon a Wife of Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI>'s
Ta&s;te for Expence, as very few E&s;tates, <HI>to which
&s;he could pretend,</HI> would &s;upport her Extrava|gance.
&mdash;The Honourable Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;Brother
to the Earl of&mdash;, was the only one, amid&s;t
a Croud of Admirers, who made any particular
Addre&s;s to her. This Gentleman was tolera|bly
hand&s;ome, and had the Art of making him|&s;elf
agreeable to the Ladies, by a certain Air of
Softne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s, which never failed to
make &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion upon tho&s;e he de&s;ired to
deceive.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> was ravi&s;hed with her Conque&s;t,
and boa&s;ted of it &s;o openly, that People, who
were acquainted with this Gentleman's Cha|racter,
fore&s;eeing her Fate, could not help pi|tying
her.</P>
<P>A very few Months Court&s;hip completed
the Ruin of poor Mi&s;s <HI>Groves:</HI> She fell a Sacri|fice
to Oaths which had been often pro&s;tituted
for the &s;ame inhuman Purpo&s;es; and became
&s;o fond of her Betrayer, that it was with great
<PB N="111" REF="127">
Difficulty he could per&s;uade her not to give him,
even in public, the mo&s;t ridiculous Proofs of
her <HI>Tenderne&s;s.</HI> Her Woman pretends, that &s;he
was ignorant of this Intrigue, till Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI>
growing big with Child, it could no longer be
concealed; it was at length agreed, &s;he &s;hould
lie-in at her own Lodgings, to prevent any Su|&s;picions
from her retreating into the Country;
but that Scheme was over-ruled by her Wo|man's
Mother, who advi&s;ed her to conceal her|&s;elf
in &s;ome Village, not far from Town, till
the Affair was over.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> approved of this &s;econd Propo&s;al,
but took Advantage of her Shape, which, being
far from delicate, would not ea&s;ily di&s;cover any
growing Bigne&s;s, to &s;tay in Town as long as
&s;he po&s;&s;ibly could. When her Removal was
nece&s;&s;ary, &s;he went to the Lodgings provided for
her, a few Miles di&s;tant from <HI>London:</HI> And,
notwith&s;tanding the Excu&s;es which were framed
for this &s;udden Ab&s;ence, the true Cau&s;e was
more than &s;u&s;pected by &s;ome bu&s;y People, who
indu&s;triou&s;ly inquired into her Affairs.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;&s;aw her but &s;eldom during her Ill|ne&s;s:
The Fear of being di&s;covered was his Pre|tence:
But her Friends ea&s;ily &s;aw through this
Di&s;gui&s;e, and were per&s;uaded Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> was
waning in his Affections.</P>
<P>As &s;he had a very &s;trong Con&s;titution, &s;he re|turned
to Town at the End of three Weeks:
The Child was dead, and &s;he looked hand|&s;omer
than ever. Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;continued his Vi|&s;its;
and the Town to make Remarks of
them. All this time the Duche&s;s never trou|bled
her&s;elf about the Conduct of this unfortu|nate
<PB N="112" REF="128">
young Creature: And the People &s;he was
with had not the Goodne&s;s to give her any Hint
of her Mi&s;conduct, and the Wa&s;te of her For|tune:
On the contrary, they almo&s;t turned her
Head with their Flatteries, preyed upon her
Fortune, and winked at her Irregularities.</P>
<P>She was now a &s;econd time with Child: Her
Character was pretty &s;everely handled by her
Enemies: Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;began openly to &s;light her:
And &s;he was now &s;everal thou&s;and Pounds in
Debt. The Mother and Si&s;ters of her Woman,
in who&s;e Hou&s;e &s;he &s;till was, were ba&s;e enough
to whi&s;per the Fault &s;he had been guilty of to
all their Acquaintances. Her Story became ge|nerally
known: She was &s;hunned and neglected
by every body; and even Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;, who had
been the Cau&s;e of her Ruin, intirely abandoned
her, and boa&s;ted openly of the Favours he had
received from her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> prote&s;ted to her Friends, That
he had promi&s;ed her Marriage; but Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;con&s;tantly
denied it, and never &s;crupled to &s;ay,
when he was que&s;tioned about it, That he found
Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> too ea&s;y a Conque&s;t to make any
Perjury nece&s;&s;ary. Her Tenderne&s;s, however,
for this ba&s;e Man, was &s;o great, that &s;he never
could bear to hear him railed at in her Pre&s;ence;
but would quarrel with the only Friends &s;he had
left, if they &s;aid any thing to his Di&s;advantage.
As &s;he was now pretty far advanced with Child,
&s;he would have retired into the Country; but
the bad Condition of her Affairs made her Re|moval
impo&s;&s;ible: In this Extremity &s;he had
Recour&s;e to her Uncle, a rich Merchant in the
City, who, having taken all the nece&s;&s;ary Pre|cautions
<PB N="113" REF="129">
for his own Security, paid Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI>'s
Debts, carrying on, in her Name, a Law-&s;uit
with the Duche&s;s, for &s;ome Lands, which were
to be put into her Hands, when &s;he was of Age,
and which that great Lady detained. Mi&s;s
<HI>Groves,</HI> being reduced to live upon &s;omething
le&s;s than an Hundred a Year, quitted <HI>London,</HI>
and came into this Part of the Country, where
&s;he was received by Mrs. <HI>Barnett,</HI> one of her
Woman's Si&s;ters, who is married to a Country
Gentleman of &s;ome Fortune: In her Hou&s;e &s;he
lay-in of a Girl, which Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;&s;ent to de|mand,
and will not be per&s;uaded to inform her
how, or in what manner, he has di&s;po&s;ed of the
Child.</P>
<P>Her former Woman leaving her, I was re|ceived
in her Place, from whom I learnt all
the&s;e Particulars: And Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> having
gained the Affections of Mr. <HI>Barnett</HI>'s Brother,
her Beauty, and the large Fortune which &s;he
has in Rever&s;ion, has induced him, notwith|&s;tanding
the Knowledge of her pa&s;t unhappy Con|duct,
to marry her. But their Marriage is yet
a Secret, Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> being apprehen&s;ive of her
Uncle's Di&s;plea&s;ure for not con&s;ulting him in
her Choice.</P>
<P>Her Hu&s;band is gone to <HI>London,</HI> with an
Intention to acquaint him with it; and, when
he returns, their Marriage will be publicly
owned.</P>

<P>Containing what a judicious Reader will
hardly approve.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MRS. <HI>Morris</HI> ending her Narration,
<HI>Arabella,</HI> who had not been able to
re&s;train her Tears at &s;ome Parts of it, thanked
her for the Trouble &s;he had been at; and a&s;|&s;ured
her of her Secrecy: Your Lady's Ca&s;e,
&s;aid &s;he, is much to be lamented; and greatly
re&s;embles the unfortunate <HI>Cleopatra</HI>'s, whom
<HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> privately marrying, with a Promi&s;e
to own her for his Wife, when he &s;hould be
peaceable Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, left
that great Queen big with Child, and, never in|tending
to perform his Promi&s;e, &s;uffered her to
be expo&s;ed to the Cen&s;ures the World has &s;o
freely ca&s;t upon her; and which &s;he &s;o little
de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> &s;eeing the favourable Light in
which <HI>Arabella</HI> viewed the Actions of her Lady,
did not think proper to &s;ay any thing to unde|ceive
her; but went out of the Clo&s;et, not a
little mortified at her Di&s;appointment: For &s;he
&s;aw &s;he was likely to receive nothing for betray|ing
her Lady's Secrets, from <HI>Arabella:</HI> Who
&s;eemed &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of the Plea&s;ure of Scan|dal,
as to be wholly ignorant of its Nature; and
not to know it when it was told her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Groves,</HI> who was ju&s;t come to Lady
<HI>Bella</HI>'s Chamber-door, to inquire for her, was
&s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her Woman come out of it;
<PB N="115" REF="131">
and who, upon meeting her, expre&s;&s;ed great
Confu&s;ion. As &s;he was going to a&s;k her &s;ome
Que&s;tions concerning her Bu&s;ine&s;s there, <HI>Ara|bella</HI>
came out of her Clo&s;et; and, &s;eeing
Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> in her Chamber, a&s;ked her Pardon
for &s;taying &s;o long from her.</P>
<P>I have been li&s;tening to your Hi&s;tory, &s;aid
&s;he, with great Frankne&s;s, which your Woman
has been relating: And I a&s;&s;ure you I am ex|tremely
&s;en&s;ible of your Misfortunes.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Groves,</HI> at the&s;e Words, blu&s;hed with
extreme Confu&s;ion; and Mrs. <HI>Morris</HI> turned
pale with A&s;toni&s;hment and Fear. <HI>Arabella,</HI>
not &s;en&s;ible that &s;he had been guilty of any In|di&s;cretion,
proceeded to make Reflections upon
&s;ome Part of her Story; which, though they
were not at all di&s;advantageous to that young
Lady, &s;he received as &s;o many In&s;ults: And
a&s;ked Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> If &s;he was not a&s;hamed to
tamper with a Servant to betray the Secrets of
her Mi&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> a little &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o rude a Que|&s;tion,
an&s;wered, however, with great Sweetne&s;s;
and prote&s;ted to her, that &s;he would make no
ill U&s;e of what &s;he had learned of her Affairs:
For, in fine, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, do you think I
am le&s;s fit to be tru&s;ted with your Secrets, than
the Prince&s;s of the <HI>Leontines</HI> was with tho&s;e of
<HI>Clelia;</HI> between whom there was no greater
Amity and Acquaintance, than with us? And
you mu&s;t certainly know, that the Secrets which
that admirable Per&s;on entru&s;ted with <HI>Ly&s;imena,</HI>
were of a Nature to be more dangerous, if re|vealed,
than yours. The Happine&s;s of <HI>Clelia</HI>
depended upon <HI>Ly&s;imena</HI>'s Fidelity: And the
<PB N="116" REF="132">
Liberty, nay, haply, the Life, of <HI>Aronces,</HI> would
have been in Danger, if &s;he had betrayed them.
Though I do not intend to arrogate to my&s;elf
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e admirable Qualities which
adorned the Prince&s;s of the <HI>Leontines,</HI> yet I will
not yield to her, or any one el&s;e, in Genero&s;ity
and Fidelity: And if you will be plea&s;ed to re|po&s;e

will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">abour as earne&s;tly for your Intere&s;t, as that
fair Prince&s;s did for tho&s;e of <HI>Aronces</HI> and <HI>Clelia.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> was &s;o bu&s;ied in reflecting upon
the Ba&s;ene&s;s of her Woman in expo&s;ing her,
that &s;he heard not a Word of this fine Harangue
(at which Mrs. <HI>Morris,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the
Cau&s;e &s;he had for Unea&s;ine&s;s, could hardly help
laughing); but, a&s;&s;uming &s;ome of that Haughti|ne&s;s
in her Looks, for which &s;he u&s;ed to be re|markable,
&s;he told Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> that &s;he imputed
her impertinent Curio&s;ity to her Country Igno|rance,
and ill Breeding: And &s;he did not doubt
but &s;he would be &s;erved in her own kind, and
meet with as bad Fortune as &s;he had done; and,
perhaps, de&s;erve it <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than &s;he did: For
there are more fal&s;e Men in the World be&s;ides
Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;; and &s;he was no hand&s;omer than
other People.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he flung out of the Room, her
Woman following, leaving <HI>Arabella</HI> in &s;uch
Confu&s;ion at a Behaviour of which &s;he had
never before had an Idea, that for &s;ome Mo|ments
&s;he remained immoveable.</P>
<P>Recollecting her&s;elf, at la&s;t, and conceiving,
that Civility required &s;he &s;hould endeavour to
appea&s;e this incen&s;ed Lady, &s;he went down
<PB N="117" REF="133">
Stairs after her; and, &s;topping her ju&s;t as &s;he
was going out of the Hou&s;e, intreated her to be
calm, and &s;uffer her to vindicate her&s;elf from
the Imputation of being impertinently curious
to know her Affairs.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Groves,</HI> quite tran&s;ported with Shame
and Anger, refu&s;ed ab&s;olutely to &s;tay.</P>
<P>At lea&s;t, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;tay till
my Coach can be got ready; and don't think
of walking home, &s;o &s;lightly attended.</P>
<P>This Offer was as &s;ullenly an&s;wered as the
other: And <HI>Arabella,</HI> finding &s;he was deter|mined
to venture home, with no other Guard
than her Woman, who &s;ilently followed her,
ordered two of her Footmen to attend her at
a &s;mall Di&s;tance; and to defend her, if there
&s;hould be Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>For who knows, &s;aid &s;he to <HI>Lucy,</HI> what Ac|cident
may happen? Some one or other of her
in&s;olent Lovers may take this Opportunity to
carry her away; and I &s;hould never forgive
my&s;elf for being the Cau&s;e of &s;uch a Misfortune
to her.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Morris</HI> having found it ea&s;y to recon|cile
her&s;elf to her Lady, by a&s;&s;uring her, that
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> was acquainted with great Part of
her Story before; and that what &s;he told her,
tended only to ju&s;tify her Conduct, as &s;he might
have been convinced by what Lady <HI>Bella</HI> &s;aid;
they both went home with a Re&s;olution to &s;ay
nothing of what had pa&s;&s;ed, with relation to the
Cau&s;e of the Di&s;gu&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> had received:
But only &s;aid, in general, that Lady <HI>Bella</HI> was
the mo&s;t ridiculous Creature in the World; and
<PB N="118" REF="134">
was &s;o totally ignorant of good Breeding, that
it was impo&s;&s;ible to conver&s;e with her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which treats of the Olympic Games.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE <HI>Arabella</HI> was ruminating on
the unaccountable Behaviour of her
new Acquaintance, &s;he received a Letter from
her Uncle, informing her (for &s;he had ex|pre&s;ly
forbid Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to write to her), that
his Son and Daughter intended to &s;et out for her
Seat in a few Days.</P>
<P>This News was received with great Sati&s;|faction
by <HI>Arabella,</HI> who hoped to find an
agreeable Companion in her Cou&s;in; and was
not &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Merit, as
not to feel &s;ome kind of Plea&s;ure at the Thought
of &s;eeing him again.</P>
<P>This Letter was &s;oon followed, by the Arri|val
of Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> and his Si&s;ter; who, upon
the Sight of <HI>Arabella,</HI> di&s;covered &s;ome Ap|pearance
of A&s;toni&s;hment and Chagrin; for,
notwith&s;tanding all her Brother had told her of
her Accompli&s;hments, &s;he could not conceive
it po&s;&s;ible for a young Lady, bred up in the
Country, to be &s;o perfectly elegant and gen|teel
as &s;he found her Cou&s;in.</P>
<P>As Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> had a large Share of Co|quetry
in her Compo&s;ition, and was fond of
Beauty in none of her own Sex but her&s;elf, &s;he
<PB N="119" REF="135">
was &s;orry to &s;ee Lady <HI>Bella</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o great
a Share; and, being in Hopes her Brother had
drawn a flattering Figure of her Cou&s;in, &s;he
was extremely di&s;appointed at finding the Ori|ginal
&s;o hand&s;ome.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> on the contrary, was highly plea&s;ed
with Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI> and, finding her Per&s;on
very agreeable, did not fail to commend her
Beauty: A &s;ort of Complai&s;ance mightily in
U&s;e among the Heroines, who knew not what
Envy or Emulation meant.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> received her Prai&s;es with
great Politene&s;s, but could not find in her Heart
to return them: And, as &s;oon as the&s;e Com|pliments
were over, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> told Lady
<HI>Bella,</HI> how tedious he had found the &s;hort Ab|&s;ence
&s;he had forced him to, and how great was
his Satisfaction at &s;eeing her again.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not di&s;pute the Truth of your la&s;t A&s;|&s;ertion,
replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;miling, &s;ince I verily
believe, you are mighty well &s;atisfied at pre|&s;ent;
but I know not how you will make it ap|pear,
that an Ab&s;ence, which you allow to be
&s;hort, has &s;eemed &s;o tedious to you; for this is
a manife&s;t Contradiction: However, pur&s;ued
&s;he, preventing his Reply, you look &s;o well,
and &s;o much at Ea&s;e, that I am apt to believe,
Ab&s;ence has agreed very well with you.</P>
<P>And yet I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
interrupting her, that I have &s;uffered more
Unea&s;ine&s;s during this Ab&s;ence, than I fear you
will permit me to tell you.</P>
<P>Since, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that Unea&s;ine&s;s has
neither made you thinner, nor paler, I don't
think you ought to be pitied: For, to &s;ay the
<PB N="120" REF="136">
Truth, in the&s;e Sort of Matters, a Per&s;on's bare
Te&s;timony has but little Weight.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was going to make her &s;ome
An&s;wer; when Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who, while they
had been &s;peaking, was adju&s;ting her Dre&s;s at
the Gla&s;s, came up to them, and made the
Conver&s;ation more general.</P>
<P>After Dinner, they adjourned to the Gardens,
where the gay Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> running eagerly
from one Walk to another, gave her Brother
as many Opportunities of talking to Lady <HI>Bella</HI>
as he could wi&s;h: However, he &s;tood in &s;uch
Awe of her, and dreaded &s;o much another
Bani&s;hment, that he did not dare, otherwi&s;e
than by di&s;tant Hints, to mention his Pa&s;&s;ion;
and <HI>Arabella,</HI> well enough plea&s;ed with a Re|&s;pect
that in &s;ome mea&s;ure came up to her Ex|pectation,
di&s;covered no Re&s;entment at In&s;inu|ations
&s;he was at Liberty to di&s;&s;emble the Know|lege
of: And if he could not, by her Behaviour,
flatter him&s;elf with any great Hopes, yet he
found as little Rea&s;on, in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Language,
to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> at the End of a few Weeks,
was &s;o tired of the magnificent Solitude &s;he
lived in, that &s;he heartily repented her Journey;
and in&s;inuated to her Brother, her Inclination
to return to Town.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> knowing his Stay was regu|lated
by his Si&s;ter's, intreated her not to expo&s;e
him to the Mortification of leaving <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;o
&s;oon; and promi&s;ed her he would contrive &s;ome
Amu&s;ements for her, which &s;hould make her
reli&s;h the Country better than &s;he had yet done.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="137">
Accordingly, he propo&s;ed to <HI>Arabella</HI> to go
to the Races, which were to be held at&mdash;a
few Miles from the Ca&s;tle: She would have
excu&s;ed her&s;elf, upon account of her Mourn|ing;
but Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> di&s;covered &s;o great an
Inclination to be pre&s;ent at this Diver&s;ion, that
<HI>Arabella</HI> could no longer refu&s;e to accompany
her.</P>
<P>Since, &s;aid &s;he to Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> you are
fond of public Diver&s;ions, it happens very
luckily, that the&s;e Races are to be held at the
Time you are here: I never heard of them before,
and I pre&s;ume 'tis a good many Years &s;ince they
were la&s;t celebrated. Pray, Sir, pur&s;ued &s;he,
turning to <HI>Glanville,</HI> do not the&s;e Races, in
&s;ome Degree, re&s;emble the <HI>Olympic</HI> Games? Do
the Candidates ride in Chariots?</P>
<P>No, Madam, replied <HI>Glanville;</HI> the Jockeys
are mounted upon the fleete&s;t Cour&s;ers they can
procure; and he who fir&s;t reaches the Goal ob|tains
the Prize.</P>
<P>And who is the fair Lady that is to be&s;tow it?
re&s;umed <HI>Arabella:</HI> I dare engage one of her
Lovers will enter the Li&s;ts; &s;he will, doubtle&s;s,
be in no le&s;s Anxiety than he; and the Shame
of being overcome, will hardly affect him with
more Concern, than her&s;elf; that is, provided
he be &s;o happy as to have gained her Affections.
I cannot help thinking the fair <HI>Eli&s;monda</HI> was
extremely happy in this Particular: For &s;he had
the Satisfaction to &s;ee her &s;ecret Admirer Victor
in all the Exerci&s;es at the <HI>Olympic</HI> Games, and
carry away the Prize from many Princes, and
Per&s;ons of rare Quality, who were Candidates
with him; and he had al&s;o the Glory to receive
<PB N="122" REF="138">
three Crowns in one Day, from the Hands of
his adored Prince&s;s; who, que&s;tionle&s;s, be|&s;towed
them upon him with an infinite deal of
Joy.</P>
<P>What Sort of Races were tho&s;e, Madam?
&s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI> who&s;e Reading had been
very confined.</P>
<P>The <HI>Olympic</HI> Games, Mi&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;o
called from <HI>Olympia,</HI> a City near which they
were performed, in the Plains of <HI>Elis,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted
of Foot and Chariot-Races; Combats with the
Ce&s;tus; Wre&s;tling, and other Sports. They
were in&s;tituted in Honour of the Gods and
Heroes; and were therefore termed &s;acred, and
were con&s;idered as a Part of Religion.</P>
<P>They were a kind of School, or military Ap|prentice&s;hip;
in which the Courage of the Youth
found con&s;tant Employment: And the Rea&s;on
why Victory in tho&s;e Games was attended with
&s;uch extraordinary Applau&s;e, was, that their
Minds might be quickened with great and noble
Pro&s;pects, when, in this Image of War, they
arrived to a Pitch of Glory, approaching, in
&s;ome re&s;pects, to that of the mo&s;t famous Con|querors.
They thought this Sort of Triumph
one of the greate&s;t Parts of Happine&s;s of which
Human Nature was capable: So that when
<HI>Diagoras</HI> had &s;een his Sons crowned in the
<HI>Olympic</HI> Games, one of his Friends made him
this Compliment, Now, <HI>Diagoras,</HI> you may die
&s;atisfied; &s;ince you can't be a God. It would
tire you, perhaps, was I to de&s;cribe all the Ex|erci&s;es
performed there: But you may form a
general Notion of them, from what you have
doubtle&s;s read of Ju&s;ts and Tournaments.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="139">
Really, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I never read
about any &s;uch Things.</P>
<P>No! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed: Well, then,
I mu&s;t tell you, that they hold a middle Place,
between a Diver&s;ion and a Combat; but the
<HI>Olympic</HI> Games were attended with a much
greater Pomp and Variety: And not only all
<HI>Greece,</HI> but other neighbouring Nations, were
in a manner drained, to furni&s;h out the Ap|pearance.</P>
<P>Well, for my Part, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
never before heard of the&s;e Sort of Races; tho&s;e
I have been at were quite different. I know
the Prizes and Bets are &s;ometimes very con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>And, doubtle&s;s, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> there
are a great many Heroes who &s;ignalize them|&s;elves
at the&s;e Races; not for the &s;ake of the
Prize, which would be unworthy of great Souls,
but to &s;atisfy that burning De&s;ire of Glory,
which &s;purs them on to every Occa&s;ion of gain|ing
it.</P>
<P>As for the Heroes, or Jockeys, &s;aid Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> call them what you plea&s;e, I believe
they have very little Share, either of the Profit
or Glory: For their Ma&s;ters have the one, and
the Hor&s;es the other.</P>
<P>Their Ma&s;ters! interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> What,
I &s;uppo&s;e, a great many foreign Princes &s;end their
Favourites to Combat, in their Name? I re|member
to have read, that <HI>Alcibiades</HI> triumphed
three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at the <HI>Olympic</HI> Games,
by means of one of his Dome&s;tics, who, in his
Ma&s;ter's Name, entered the Li&s;ts.</P>

Sentence.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Day being come on which they de|&s;igned
to be pre&s;ent at the Races (or, as
<HI>Arabella</HI> called them, the <HI>Games</HI>), Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
having &s;pent four long Hours in dre&s;&s;ing
her&s;elf to the greate&s;t Advantage, in order, if
po&s;&s;ible, to eclip&s;e her lovely Cou&s;in, who&s;e
Mourning, being much deeper, was le&s;s capable
of Ornaments, came into her Chamber; and,
finding her &s;till in her Morning Dre&s;s, For
Heaven's &s;ake, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, when do
you purpo&s;e to be ready? Why it is almo&s;t
time to be gone, my Brother &s;ays, and here
you are not a bit dre&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="141">
Don't be unea&s;y, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;miling; and,
going to her Toilet, I &s;han't make you wait
long.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;eating her&s;elf near the Table,
re&s;olved to be pre&s;ent while her Cou&s;in was
dre&s;&s;ing, that &s;he might have an Opportunity to
make &s;ome Remarks to her Di&s;advantage: But
&s;he was extremely mortified, to ob&s;erve the
Ha&s;te and Negligence &s;he made her Women
u&s;e in this important Employment; and that,
notwith&s;tanding her Indifference, nothing could
appear more lovely and genteel.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> however, plea&s;ed her&s;elf with
the Certainty of &s;eeing her Cou&s;in's Dre&s;s ex|tremely
ridiculed, for the peculiar Fa&s;hion of
her Gown: And the Veil, which, as becoming as
it was, would, by its Novelty, occa&s;ion great
Diver&s;ion among the Ladies, helped to comfort
her for the Superiority of her Charms; which,
partial as &s;he was to her own, &s;he could not help
&s;ecretly confe&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> being dre&s;&s;ed in much le&s;s time
than her Cou&s;in, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was admitted,
who led her down Stairs to her Coach, which
was waiting: His Si&s;ter (&s;ecretly repin|ing
at the Advantage <HI>Arabella</HI> had over her,
in having &s;o re&s;pectful an Adorer) followed:
And, being placed in the Coach, they &s;et out
with great Appearance of Good-humour on all
Sides.</P>
<P>They got to&mdash;but ju&s;t time enough to
&s;ee the Beginning of the fir&s;t Cour&s;e: <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who fan&s;ied the Jockeys were Per&s;ons of great
Di&s;tinction, &s;oon became intere&s;ted in the Fate
of one of them, who&s;e Appearance plea&s;ed her
<PB N="126" REF="142">
more than the others. Accordingly, &s;he made
Vows for his Succe&s;s, and appeared &s;o extremely
rejoiced at the Advantage he had gained, that
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> maliciou&s;ly told her, People
would make Remarks at the Joy &s;he expre&s;&s;ed,
and fan&s;y &s;he had a more than ordinary Intere&s;t
in that Jockey, who had fir&s;t reached the Goal.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> whom this impertinent In&s;inu|ation
of his Si&s;ter had filled with Confu&s;ion
and Spite, &s;at biting his Lips, trembling for
the Effect it would produce in <HI>Arabella:</HI> But
&s;he, giving quite another Turn to her Cou&s;in's
Words, I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid &s;he, with a Smile,
I am not any further intere&s;ted in the Fate of
this Per&s;on, who has hitherto been &s;ucce&s;sful,
than what the Hand&s;omene&s;s of his Garb, and
the Superiority of his Skill, may demand, from
an unprejudiced Spectator: And, though I per|ceive
you imagine he is &s;ome concealed Lover
of mine, yet I don't remember to have ever
&s;een him: And I am confident it is not for my
&s;ake that he entered the Li&s;ts; nor is it my
Pre&s;ence which animates him.</P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me, Madam! replied Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
Who would ever think of &s;uch &s;trange
things as the&s;e you talk of? No-body will pre|tend
to deny that you are very hand&s;ome, to be
&s;ure; but yet, thank Heaven, the Sight of you
is not &s;o dangerous, but that &s;uch &s;ort of Peo|ple,
as the&s;e are, may e&s;cape your Chains.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was &s;o wholly taken up with the
Event of the Races, that &s;he gave but very little
Heed to this &s;arca&s;tic An&s;wer of Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI>
who&s;e Brother, taking Advantage of an Oppor|tunity
which <HI>Arabella</HI> gave him by putting her
<PB N="127" REF="143">
Head quite out of the Coach, chid her very &s;e|verely
for the Liberty &s;he took with her Cou&s;in.
<HI>Arabella,</HI> by looking earne&s;tly out of the Win|dow,
had given &s;o full a View of her fine Per|&s;on
to a young Baronet, who was not many
Paces from the Coach, that, being &s;truck with
Admiration at the Sight of &s;o lovely a Creature,
he was going up to &s;ome of her Attendants to
a&s;k who &s;he was, when he perceived Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
with whom he was intimately acquainted,
in the Coach with her: Immediately he made
him&s;elf known to his Friend, being exce&s;&s;ively
rejoiced at having got an Opportunity of be|ginning
an Acquaintance with a Lady who&s;e
Sight had &s;o charmed him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had ob&s;erved the pro|found
Bow he made to <HI>Arabella,</HI> accompanied
with a Glance that &s;hewed an extreme Admi|ration
of her, was very little plea&s;ed at this
Meeting; yet he di&s;&s;embled his Thoughts well
enough in his Reception of him. But Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville</HI> was quite overjoyed, hoping &s;he would
now have her Turn of Gallantry and Compli|ment:
Therefore, acco&s;ting him in her free Man|ner,
Dear Sir <HI>George,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, you come in a
lucky Time to brighten up the Conver&s;ation:
Relations are &s;uch dull Company for one an|other,
'tis half a Minute &s;ince we have ex|changed
a Word.</P>
<P>My Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;miling, has &s;o
&s;trange a Di&s;po&s;ition for Mirth, that &s;he thinks
all her Moments are lo&s;t, in which &s;he finds
nothing to laugh at: For my Part, I do &s;o
earne&s;tly long to know, to which of the&s;e Pre|tenders
Fortune will give the Victory, that I
<PB N="128" REF="144">
can &s;uffer my Cares for them to receive no In|terruption
from my Cou&s;in's agreeable Gaiety.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> ob&s;erving the Baronet gazed
upon <HI>Arabella</HI> earne&s;tly while &s;he was &s;peaking
tho&s;e few Words, re&s;olved to hinder him from
making any Reply, by a&s;king him &s;everal Que|&s;tions
concerning the Racers, their Owners, and
the Bets which were laid; to which <HI>Arabella</HI>
added, And pray, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, do me the Fa|vour
to tell me, if you know who that gallant
Man is, who has already won the fir&s;t Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I don't know really, Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI>
what his Name is, extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at her
Manner of a&s;king.</P>
<P>The Jockey had now gained the Goal a Se|cond
time; and <HI>Arabella</HI> could not conceal her
Satisfaction. Que&s;tionle&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, he is a
very extraordinary Per&s;on; but I am afraid we
&s;hall not have the Plea&s;ure of knowing who he
is; for if he has any Rea&s;on for keeping him&s;elf
concealed, he will evade any Inquiries after him,
by &s;lipping out of the Li&s;ts while this Hurry and
Tumult la&s;ts, as <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI> did at the <HI>Olympic</HI>
Games; yet, notwith&s;tanding all his Care, he
was di&s;covered by being obliged to fight a &s;ingle
Combat with one of the Per&s;ons whom he had
wor&s;ted at tho&s;e Games.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who &s;aw his Si&s;ter, by her lit|tle
Coquetries with Sir <HI>George,</HI> had prevented
him from hearing great Part of this odd Speech,
propo&s;ed returning to the Ca&s;tle; to which <HI>Ara|bella</HI>
agreed: But, conceiving Civility obliged
her to offer the Convenience of a Lodging to a
Stranger of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Appearance, and who
was an Acquaintance of her Cou&s;ins, You mu&s;t
<PB N="129" REF="145">
permit me, &s;aid &s;he to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to in|treat
your noble Friend will accompany us to
the Ca&s;tle, where he will meet with better Ac|commodations
than at any Inn he can find; for
I conceive, that, coming only to be a Spectator
of the&s;e Games, he is wholly unprovided with
a Lodging.</P>
<P>The Baronet, &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o uncommon a
Civility, was at a Lo&s;s what An&s;wer to make
her at fir&s;t; but, recollecting him&s;elf, he told
her that he would, if &s;he plea&s;ed, do him&s;elf the
Honour to attend her home; but, as his Hou&s;e
was at no great Di&s;tance from&mdash;, he would
be put to no Inconveniency for a Lodging.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was not willing to part
&s;o &s;oon with the Baronet, in&s;i&s;ted, with her
Cou&s;in's Leave, upon his coming into the
Coach; which he accordingly did, giving his
Hor&s;e to the Care of his Servant; and they pro|ceeded
together to the Ca&s;tle; <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;till
continuing to talk of the Games, as &s;he called
them, while poor <HI>Glanville,</HI> who was exce&s;&s;ively
confu&s;ed, endeavoured to change the Di&s;cour&s;e,
not without an Apprehen&s;ion, that every Sub|iect
he could think of, would afford <HI>Arabella</HI> an
Occa&s;ion of &s;hewing her Foible; which, not|with&s;tanding
the Pain it gave him, could not
le&s;&s;en the Love he felt for her.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who&s;e Admiration of Lady <HI>Bella</HI>
increa&s;ed the longer he &s;aw her, was extremely
plea&s;ed with the Opportunity &s;he had given him
of cultivating an Acquaintance with her: He
therefore lengthened out his Vi&s;it, in hopes of
being able to &s;ay &s;ome fine Things to her before
he went away; but Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who &s;trove
<PB N="130" REF="146">
by all the little Arts &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of, to en|gage
his Conver&s;ation wholly to her&s;elf, put it
ab&s;olutely out of his Power; &s;o that he was
obliged to take his Leave without having the
Satisfaction of even pre&s;&s;ing the fair Hand of
<HI>Arabella;</HI> &s;o clo&s;ely was he ob&s;erved by her Cou|&s;in.
Happy was it for him, that he was pre|vented
by her Vigilance from attempting a Piece
of Gallantry, which would, undoubtedly, have
procured him a Bani&s;hment from her Pre&s;ence;
but, ignorant, how kind Fortune was to him in
balking his De&s;igns, he was ungrateful enough
to go away in a mighty ill Humour with this
fickle Godde&s;s: So little capable are poor Mor|tals
of knowing what is be&s;t for them!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing &s;ome curious Anecdotes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>LADY <HI>Bella,</HI> from the Familiarity with
which Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> treated this gay Gen|tleman,
concluding him her Lover, and one
who was apparently well received by her, had a
&s;trong Curio&s;ity to know her Adventures; and
as they were walking the next Morning in the
Garden, &s;he told her, that &s;he thought it was
very &s;trange they had hitherto ob&s;erved &s;uch a Re|&s;erve
to each other, as to bani&s;h mutual Tru&s;t and
Confidence from their Conver&s;ation: Whence
comes it, Cou&s;in, added &s;he, being &s;o young and
lovely as you are, that you, que&s;tionle&s;s, have
been engaged in many Adventures, you have
<PB N="131" REF="147">
never repo&s;ed Tru&s;t enough in me to &s;avour me
with a Recital of them?</P>
<P>Engaged in many Adventures, Madam! re|turned
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> not liking the Phra&s;e:
I believe I have been engaged in as few as your
Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>You are too obliging, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who mi&s;took what &s;he &s;aid for a Compliment;
for &s;ince you have more Beauty than I, and
have al&s;o had more Opportunities of making
your&s;elf beloved, que&s;tionle&s;s you have a
greater Number of Admirers.</P>
<P>As for Admirers, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> bridling,
I fan&s;y I have had my Share! Thank God, I
never found my&s;elf neglected; but, I a&s;&s;ure
you, Madam, I have had no Adventures, as
you call them, with any of them.</P>
<P>No, really! interrutped <HI>Arabella,</HI> inno|cently.</P>
<P>No, really, Madam, retorted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI>
and I am &s;urpri&s;ed you &s;hould think &s;o.</P>
<P>Indeed, my Dear, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> you are
very happy in this re&s;pect, and al&s;o very &s;ingu|lar;
for I believe there are few young Ladies in
the World, who have any Preten&s;ions to Beau|ty,
that have not given Ri&s;e to a great many
Adventures; and &s;ome of them haply very fa|tal.</P>
<P>If you knew more of the World, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI>
&s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> pertly, you would not be &s;o
apt to think, that young Ladies engage them|&s;elves
in trouble&s;ome Adventures: Truly the
Ladies that are brought up in Town are not &s;o
ready to run away with every Man they &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="148">
No, certainly, interrupted <HI>Arabella;</HI> they do
not give their Con&s;ent to &s;uch Proceedings; but
for all that, they are, doubtle&s;s, run away with
many times; for truly there are &s;ome Men,
who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o unbridled, that they will
have recour&s;e to the mo&s;t violent Methods to
po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the Objects they love.
Pray do you remember how often <HI>Mandana</HI> was
run away with?</P>
<P>Not I indeed, Madam, replied Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville;</HI>
I know nothing about her; but I &s;uppo&s;e
&s;he is a <HI>Jew,</HI> by her outlandi&s;h Name.</P>
<P>She was no <HI>Jew,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> tho' &s;he fa|voured
that People very much; for &s;he obtained
the Liberty of great Numbers of them from <HI>Cy|rus,</HI>
who had taken them Captives, and could
deny her nothing &s;he a&s;ked.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI> and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he
denied <HI>him</HI> nothing he a&s;ked; and &s;o they were
even.</P>
<P>Indeed but &s;he did tho', re&s;umed <HI>Arabella;</HI>
for &s;he refu&s;ed to give him a glorious Scarf
which &s;he wore, tho' he begged it on his Knees.</P>
<P>And &s;he was very much in the right, &s;aid
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville;</HI> for I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why a Lo|ver
&s;hould expect a Gift of any Value from his
Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;uch a Gift was
worth a Million of Services; and, had he ob|tained
it, it would have been a glorious Di|&s;tinction
for him: However, <HI>Mandana</HI> refu&s;ed it;
and, &s;everely virtuous as you are, I am per&s;uaded
you can't help thinking, &s;he was a little too ri|gorous
in denying a Favour to a Lover like
him&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="149">
Severely virtuous, Lady <HI>Bella!</HI> &s;aid Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> colouring with Anger: Pray what
do you mean by that? Have you any Rea&s;on
to imagine, I would grant any Favour to a
Lover?</P>
<P>Why, if I did, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> would
it derogate &s;o much from your Glory, think you,
to be&s;tow a Favour upon a Lover worthy your
E&s;teem, and from whom you had received a
thou&s;and Marks of a mo&s;t pure and faithful Pa&s;|&s;ion,
and al&s;o a great Number of very &s;ingular
Services?</P>
<P>I hope, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> it will
never be my Fate to be &s;o much obliged to any
Lover, as to be under a Nece&s;&s;ity of granting
him Favours in Requital.</P>
<P>I vow, Cou&s;in, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> you
put me in mind of the fair and virtuous <HI>Antonia,</HI>
who was &s;o rigid and au&s;tere, that &s;he thought
all Expre&s;&s;ions of Love were criminal; and was
&s;o far from granting any Per&s;on Permi&s;&s;ion to
love her, that &s;he thought it a mortal Offence
to be adored even in private.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who could not imagine <HI>Ara|bella</HI>
&s;poke this &s;eriou&s;ly, but that it was de|&s;igned
to &s;neer at her great Eagerne&s;s to make
Conque&s;ts, and the Liberties &s;he allowed her&s;elf
in, which had probably come to her Knowlege,
was &s;o extremely vexed at the malicious Je&s;t, as
&s;he thought it, that, not being able to revenge
her&s;elf, &s;he bur&s;t into Tears.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI>'s Good-nature made her be greatly
affected at this Sight; and, a&s;king her Pardon
for having unde&s;ignedly occa&s;ioned her &s;o much
Unea&s;ine&s;s, begged her to be compo&s;ed, and
<PB N="134" REF="150">
tell her in what &s;he had offended her, that &s;he
might be able to ju&s;tify her&s;elf in her Appre|hen&s;ions.</P>
<P>You have made no Scruple to own, Madam,
&s;aid &s;he, that you think me capable of granting
Favours to Lovers, when, Heaven knows, I ne|ver
granted a Ki&s;s without a great deal of Con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>And you had certainly much Rea&s;on for Con|fu&s;ion,
&s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch
a Confe&s;&s;ion: I a&s;&s;ure you I never injured you
&s;o much in my Thoughts, as to &s;uppo&s;e you
ever granted a Favour of &s;o criminal a Nature.</P>
<P>Look you there now! &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
weeping more violently than before: I knew
what all your round-about Speeches would come
to: All you have &s;aid in Vindication of grant|ing
Favours, was only to draw me into a Con|fe&s;&s;ion
of what I have done: How ungenerous
was that!</P>
<P>The Favours I &s;poke of, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
were quite of another Nature, than tho&s;e
it &s;eems you have &s;o liberally granted: Such as
giving a Scarf, a Bracelet, or &s;ome &s;uch Thing,
to a Lover, who had haply &s;ighed whole Years
in Silence, and did not pre&s;ume to declare his
Pa&s;&s;ion, till he had lo&s;t be&s;t Part of his Blood in
Defence of the Fair one he loved: It was when
you maintained, that <HI>Mandana</HI> was in the right
to refu&s;e her magnificent Scarf to the illu&s;trious
<HI>Cyrus,</HI> that I took upon me to oppo&s;e your Ri|gidne&s;s;
and &s;o much mi&s;taken was I in your
Temper, that I fooli&s;hly compared you to the
fair and wi&s;e <HI>Antonia,</HI> who&s;e Severity was &s;o
remarkable; but really, by what I under&s;tand
<PB N="135" REF="151">
from your own Confe&s;&s;ion, your Di&s;po&s;ition re|&s;embles
that of the incon&s;iderate <HI>Julia,</HI> who
would receive a Declaration of Love without
Anger from any one; and was not over-&s;hy,
any more than your&s;elf, of granting Favours al|mo&s;t
as con&s;iderable as that you have men|tioned.</P>
<P>While <HI>Arabella</HI> was &s;peaking, Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
having dried up her Tears, &s;at &s;ilently &s;well|ing
with Rage, not knowing whether &s;he &s;hould
openly avow her Re&s;entment for the injurious
Language her Cou&s;in had u&s;ed to her, by go|ing
away immediately, or, by making up the
Matter, appear &s;till to be her Friend, that &s;he
might have the more Opportunities of revenge|ing
her&s;elf. The Impetuo&s;ity of her Temper
made her mo&s;t inclined to the former; but the
Knowlege that Sir <HI>George</HI> was to &s;tay yet &s;ome
Months in the Country, made her unwilling to
leave a Place, where &s;he might often &s;ee a Man
who&s;e fine Per&s;on had made &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion
upon her Heart; and, not enduring to leave &s;uch
a charming Conque&s;t to <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;he re&s;olved
to &s;uppre&s;s her Re&s;entment for the pre&s;ent; and
li&s;tened, without any Appearance of Di&s;com|po&s;ure,
to a fine Harangue of her Cou&s;in upon
the Nece&s;&s;ity of Re&s;erve, and di&s;tant Behaviour,
to Men who pre&s;umed to declare them&s;elves
Lovers, enforcing her Precepts with Examples
drawn from all the Romances &s;he had ever read;
at the End of which &s;he embraced her, and
a&s;&s;ured her, if &s;he had &s;aid any thing har&s;h, it
proceeded from her great Regard to her Glory,
of which &s;he ardently wi&s;hed to &s;ee her as fond
as her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="152">
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> con&s;trained her&s;elf to make a
Reply that might not appear di&s;agreeable: And
they were upon the&s;e Terms, when Mr. <HI>Glan|ville</HI>
came up to them, and told Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> Sir
<HI>George</HI> had &s;ent to intreat their Company at his
Hou&s;e that Day: But, added he, as I pre&s;ume
you will not think proper to go, on account of
your Mourning, neither my Si&s;ter nor I will ac|cept
the Invitation.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> ha&s;tily,
Lady <HI>Bella</HI> will not expect &s;uch a needle&s;s Piece
of Ceremony from us; and, if &s;he don't think
proper to go, &s;he won't confine <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P>By no means, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;miling;

purely for your Sake, it would not

<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being plea&s;ed to find his Cou|&s;in
di&s;covered no Inclination to go, would have
per&s;uaded his Si&s;ter not to leave Lady <HI>Bella:</HI>
But Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> looked &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed at
his Reque&s;t, that he was obliged to in&s;i&s;t upon
it no more; and, both retiring to dre&s;s, Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> went up to her Apartment, and betook
her&s;elf to her Books, which &s;upplied the Place
of all Company to her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> having taken more than or|dinary
Pains in dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, in order to ap|pear
charming in the Eyes of Sir <HI>George,</HI> came
in to pay her Compliments to Lady <HI>Bella</HI> before
&s;he went, not doubting but &s;he would be cha|grined
to &s;ee her look &s;o well: But Lady <HI>Bella,</HI>
on the contrary, prai&s;ed the Clearne&s;s of her
Complexion, and the Sparkling of her Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="153">
I que&s;tion not, &s;aid &s;he, but you will give
Fetters to more Per&s;ons than one To-day; but

to have a &s;pecial Care of your own.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who could not think it po&s;|&s;ible,
one Woman could prai&s;e another with
any Sincerity, ca&s;t a Glance at the Gla&s;s, fear|ing
it was rather becau&s;e &s;he looked but indif|ferently,
that her Cou&s;in was &s;o lavi&s;h in her

a Face infinitely more lovely than her own, Mr.

taken Leave of Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> led his
Si&s;ter to the Coach.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who was extremely mortified to
find Lady <HI>Bella</HI> not in it, handed Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville</HI>

her &s;o much, that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was in hopes

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine is engaged in a very
perilous Adventure.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the mean time, that &s;olitary Fair one was
alarmed by a Fear of a very unaccountable
Nature; for, being in the Evening in her Clo&s;et,
the Windows of which had a Pro&s;pect of the
Gardens, &s;he &s;aw her illu&s;trious concealed Lo|ver,
who went by the Name of <HI>Edward,</HI> while
he was in her Father's Service, talking with
great Emotion to her Hou&s;e-Steward, who
&s;eemed earne&s;tly to li&s;ten to &s;ome Propo&s;itions
he was making to him. Her Surprize at this
Sight was &s;o great, that &s;he had not Power to
ob&s;erve them any longer; but, &s;eating her&s;elf in
her Chair, &s;he had ju&s;t Spirits enough to call
<HI>Lucy</HI> to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance; who, extremely frighted
at the pale Looks of her Lady, gave her a
Smelling-bottle, and was preparing to cut her
Lace, when <HI>Arabella,</HI> preventing her, told her
in a low Voice, that &s;he feared &s;he &s;hould be
betrayed into the Hands of an in&s;olent Lover,
who was come to &s;teal her away. Yes, added
&s;he with great Emotion, I have &s;een this pre|&s;umptuous
Man holding a Conver&s;ation with
one of my Servants; and tho' I could not po&s;|&s;ibly,
at this Di&s;tance, hear their Di&s;cour&s;e,
yet the Ge&s;tures they u&s;ed in &s;peaking, explained
it too well to me; and I have Rea&s;on to ex|pect,
I &s;hall &s;uffer the &s;ame Violence that many
illu&s;trious Ladies have done before me; and be
<PB N="139" REF="155">
carried away by Force from my own Hou&s;e, as
they were.</P>
<P>Alas! Madam! &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> terrified at this
Di&s;cour&s;e, who is it that intends to carry your
Lady&s;hip away? Sure no Robbers will attempt
any Mi&s;chief at &s;uch a time as this!</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>Lucy,</HI> replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> with great Gra|vity,
the wor&s;t kind of Robbers; Robbers who
do not prey upon Gold and Jewels; but,
what is infinitely more precious, Liberty and
Honour. Do you know that Per&s;on who called
him&s;elf <HI>Edward,</HI> and worked in the&s;e Gardens
like a common Gardener, is now in the Hou&s;e,
corrupting my Servants; and, que&s;tionle&s;s, pre|paring
to force open my Chamber, and carry
me away? And Heaven knows when I &s;hall be
delivered from his Chains.</P>
<P>God forbid, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;obbing, that ever
&s;uch a Lady &s;hould have &s;uch hard Hap! What
Crime, I wonder, can you be guilty of, to de|&s;erve
to be in Chains?</P>
<P>My Crime, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> is to have At|tractions
which expo&s;e me to the&s;e inevitable
Misfortunes, which even the greate&s;t Prince&s;&s;es
have not e&s;caped.&mdash;But, dear <HI>Lucy,</HI> can you
not think of &s;ome Methods by which I may
avoid the Evil which waits me? Who knows
but that he may, within the&s;e few Moments,
force a Pa&s;&s;age into my Apartment? The&s;e
&s;light Locks can make but a poor Re&s;i&s;tance to
the Violence he will be capable of u&s;ing.</P>
<P>Oh dear Madam! cried <HI>Lucy,</HI> trembling,
and pre&s;&s;ing near her, what &s;hall we do?</P>
<P>I a&s;ked your Advice, &s;aid &s;he; but I perceive
you are le&s;s able than my&s;elf to think of any
<PB N="140" REF="156">
thing to &s;ave me.&mdash;Ah! <HI>Glanville,</HI> pur&s;ued &s;he,
&s;ighing, would to Heaven thou wert here now!</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
I am &s;ure, would not &s;uffer any one to hurt
your Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>As thou value&s;t my Friend&s;hip, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, never acquaint him
with what has ju&s;t now e&s;caped my Lips: True,
I did call upon him in this Perplexity; I did
pronounce his Name; and that, haply, with a
Sigh, which involuntarily &s;orced its Way: And,
que&s;tionle&s;s, if he knew his good Fortune, even
amid&s;t the Danger of lo&s;ing me for ever, he
would re&s;ent &s;ome Emotions of Joy: But I
&s;hould die with Shame at having &s;o indi&s;creetly
contributed to his Satisfaction: And, therefore,
again I charge you, conceal, with the utmo&s;t
Care, what I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> I &s;hall tell him
nothing but what your Lady&s;hip bids me; and
I am &s;o frighted, that I can think of nothing
but that terrible Man, that wants to carry you
away. Mercy on us! added &s;he, &s;tarting, I
think I hear &s;omebody on the Stairs!</P>
<P>Do not be alarmed, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> in a ma|je&s;tic
Tone: It is I who have mo&s;t Rea&s;on to
fear: Neverthele&s;s, I hope the Grandeur of my
Courage will not &s;ink under this Accident.
Hark, &s;omebody knocks at the Door of my
Antechamber:&mdash;My own Virtue &s;hall &s;upport
me:&mdash;Go, <HI>Lucy,</HI> and a&s;k who it is.</P>
<P>Indeed I can't, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, clinging
to her: Pray pardon me: Indeed I am &s;o afraid,
I cannot &s;tir.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="157">
Weak-&s;ouled Wench! &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> How
unfit art thou for Accidents like the&s;e! Ah!
had <HI>Cylenia</HI> and <HI>Narte&s;ia</HI> been like thee, the
fair <HI>Berenice,</HI> and the Divine Prince&s;s of <HI>Media,</HI>
had not &s;o eagerly intreated their Ravi&s;hers to
afford them their Company in their Captivity:
But go, I order you, and a&s;k who it is that
is at the Door of my Apartment: They
knock again: Offer at no Excu&s;es; but do your
Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;eeing her Lady was really angry, went
trembling out of the Clo&s;et; but would go no
farther than her Bedchamber, from whence &s;he
called out to know who was at the Door.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s with your Lady, &s;aid
the Hou&s;e-Steward (for it was he that knocked):
Can I &s;peak with her at pre&s;ent?</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> a little rea&s;&s;ured by his Voice, made
no An&s;wer; but, creeping &s;oftly to the Door of
the Antechamber, double-locked it; and then
cried out in a Tran&s;port, No, I will take Care
you &s;hall not come to my Lady.</P>
<P>And why, pray, Mrs. <HI>Lucy?</HI> &s;aid the Steward:
What have I done, that you are &s;o much my
Enemy?</P>
<P>You are a Rogue, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> growing very
courageous, becau&s;e the Door was locked be|tween
them.</P>
<P>A Rogue! &s;aid he, What Rea&s;on have you
for calling me a Rogue? I a&s;&s;ure you I will ac|quaint
my Lady with your In&s;olence. I came
to &s;peak to her Lady&s;hip about <HI>Edward;</HI> who
prayed me to intercede for him, that he may
be taken again into her Service: For he &s;ays,
my Lady never believed any thing again&s;t him;
<PB N="142" REF="158">
and that was my Bu&s;ine&s;s: But, when I &s;ee
her, I'll know whether you are allowed to abu&s;e
me in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> by this time, was advanced as
far as the Bedchamber, longing to know what
&s;ort of Conference <HI>Lucy</HI> was holding with her
intended Ravi&s;her: When that faithful Confi|dante,
&s;eeing her, came running to her, and
whi&s;pered her, that the Hou&s;e-Steward was at
the Door, and &s;aid he wanted to intercede for
<HI>Edward.</HI></P>
<P>Ah! the Traitor! &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> retiring
again: Has he, then, really bargained with that
di&s;loyal Man, to deliver up his Mi&s;tre&s;s? I am
undone, <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, unle&s;s I can find a
Way to e&s;cape out of the Hou&s;e. They will,
que&s;tionle&s;s, &s;oon force the Doors of my Apart|ment.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> your Lady&s;hip went
down the Stairs that lead from your Dre&s;&s;ing|room
into the Garden; and you may hide your|&s;elf
in the Gardener's Hou&s;e till Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
come.</P>
<P>I approve, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> of one Part of your
Propo&s;al: But I &s;hall not tru&s;t my&s;elf in the
Gardener's Hou&s;e; who, que&s;tionle&s;s, is in the
Plot with the re&s;t of my perfidious Servants,
&s;ince none of them have endeavoured to adver|ti&s;e
me of my Danger. If we can gain the
Gardens undi&s;covered, we may get out by that
Door at the Foot of the Terrace, which leads
into the Fields; for you know I always keep
the Key of that private Door: So, <HI>Lucy,</HI> let us
commend our&s;elves to the Direction of Provi|dence,
and be gone immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="159">
But what &s;hall we do, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI>
when we are got out?</P>
<P>Why, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> you &s;hall conduct me
to your Brother's; and, probably, we may meet
with &s;ome generous Cavalier by the Way, who
will protect us till we get thither: However, as
I have as great a Danger to fear within Doors,
as without, I will venture to make my E&s;cape,
though I &s;hould not be &s;o fortunate as to meet
with any Knight who will undertake to pro|tect
me from the Danger which I may appre|hend
in the Fields.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he gave the Key of the Door to
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who&s;e Heart beat violently with Fear;
and, covering her&s;elf with &s;ome black Cypre&s;s,
which &s;he wore in the Nature of a Veil, went
&s;oftly down the little Stairca&s;e to the Terrace,
followed by <HI>Lucy</HI> (who looked eagerly about her
every Step that &s;he went); and, having gained
the Garden-door, ha&s;tily unlocked it, and fled,
as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, cro&s;s the Fields, in order to
procure a Sanctuary at <HI>William</HI>'s Hou&s;e: <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
begging Heaven to throw &s;ome generous
Cavalier in her Way, who&s;e Protection &s;he
might implore, and, taking every Tree at a
Di&s;tance for a Hor&s;e and Knight, ha&s;tened her
Steps to meet her approaching Succour; which,
as &s;oon as &s;he came near, mi&s;erably balked her
Expectations.</P>
<P>Though <HI>William</HI>'s Farm was not more than
two Miles from the Ca&s;tle; yet <HI>Arabella,</HI> un|u&s;ed
to &s;uch a rude Way of Travelling, began
to be greatly fatigued: The Fear &s;he was in of
being pur&s;ued by her apprehended Ravi&s;her, had
&s;o violent an Effect upon her Spirits, that &s;he
<PB N="144" REF="160">
was hardly able to pro&s;ecute her Flight; and, to
complete her Misfortunes, happening to &s;tumble
over a Stump of a Tree that lay in her Way,
&s;he &s;trained her Ancle; and the violent Angui&s;h
&s;he felt, threw her into a Swoon.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> upon who&s;e Arm &s;he leaned, perceiv|ing
her fainting, &s;creamed out aloud, not know|ing
what to do with her in that Condition: She
placed her upon the Ground; and, &s;upporting
her Head again&s;t that fatal Stump, began to rub
her Temples, weeping exce&s;&s;ively all the time.
Her Swoon &s;till continuing, the poor Girl was
in inconceivable Terror: Her Brother's Hou&s;e
was now but a little Way off; but it being im|po&s;&s;ible
for her to carry her Lady thither with|out
&s;ome Help, &s;he knew not what to re&s;olve
upon.</P>
<P>At length, thinking it better to leave her for
a few Moments, to run for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, than to
&s;it by her and &s;ee her peri&s;h for want of it, &s;he
left her, though not without extreme Agony;
and flew, with the utmo&s;t Eagerne&s;s, to her
Brother's. She was lucky enough to meet
him ju&s;t coming out of his Door; and, telling
him the Condition in which &s;he left her Lady,
he, without a&s;king any Que&s;tions about the
Occa&s;ion of &s;o &s;trange an Accident, notwith|&s;tanding
his Amazement, ran with all Speed to
the Place where <HI>Lucy</HI> had left her: But, to their
A&s;toni&s;hment and Sorrow, &s;he was not to be
found: They walked a long time in Search of
her; and <HI>Lucy,</HI> being almo&s;t di&s;tracted with
Fear le&s;t &s;he had been carried away, made
Complaints that &s;o puzzled her Brother he
knew not what to &s;ay to her: But, finding their
<PB N="145" REF="161">
Search fruitle&s;s, they agreed to go home to the
Ca&s;tle, &s;uppo&s;ing, with &s;ome Appearance of
Rea&s;on, that they might hear of her there.</P>
<P>Here they found nothing but Grief and Con|fu&s;ion.
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> and his Si&s;ter were ju&s;t
returned, and had been at Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s Apart|ment;
but, not finding her there, they a&s;ked
her Women where &s;he was, who, not know|ing
any thing of her Flight, concluded &s;he was
in the Garden with <HI>Lucy.</HI> Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;ur|pri&s;ed
at her being at that Hour in the Garden,
ran eagerly to engage her to come in, being ap|prehen&s;ive
&s;he would take Cold, by &s;taying &s;o
late in the Air: But, not finding her in any of
her u&s;ual Walks, he ordered &s;everal of the
Servants to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;earching the whole
Garden, &s;ending them to different Places: But
they all returned without Succe&s;s; which filled
him with the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>He was returning, exce&s;&s;ively unea&s;y, to the
Hou&s;e, when he &s;aw <HI>Lucy;</HI> who had been ju&s;t
told, in an&s;wer to her Inquiries about her Lady,
that they were gone to look for her in the
Garden; and running up to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who hoped to hear News of Lady <HI>Bella</HI> from
her, Oh! Sir, &s;aid &s;he, is my Lady found?</P>
<P>What! <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> (more
alarmed than before), do not you know where
&s;he is? I thought you had been with her.</P>
<P>Oh! dear, cried <HI>Lucy,</HI> wringing her Hands;
for certain my poor Lady was &s;tolen away while
&s;he was in that fainting Fit. Sir, &s;aid &s;he to
<HI>Glanville,</HI> I know who the Per&s;on is that my
Lady &s;aid (and almo&s;t broke my Heart) would
<PB N="146" REF="162">
keep her in Chains: He was in the Hou&s;e not
many Hours ago.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;u&s;pecting this was &s;ome new
Whim of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, would not &s;uffer <HI>Lucy</HI> to
&s;ay any more before the Servants, who &s;tood
gaping with A&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;trange Things
&s;he uttered; but bid her follow him to his
Apartment, and he would hear what &s;he could
inform him concerning this Accident. He
would, if po&s;&s;ible, have prevented his Si&s;ter
from being pre&s;ent at the Story; but, not being
able to form any Excu&s;e for not &s;uffering her to
hear every thing that related to her Cou&s;in, they
all three went into his Chamber; where he de|&s;ired
<HI>Lucy</HI> to tell him what &s;he knew about her
Lady.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;obbing,
that there came a Man here to take away my
Lady: A great Man he is, though he worked
in the Gardens; for he was in Love with her:
And &s;o he would not own who he was.</P>
<P>And pray, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> Who
told you he was a great Man, as you &s;ay?</P>
<P>My Lady told me, &s;aid <HI>Lucy:</HI> But, <HI>how|&s;omever,</HI>
he was turned away; for the Gar|dener
&s;ays he catched him &s;tealing Carp.</P>
<P>A very great Man, indeed, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
that would &s;teal Carp!</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, that was
only a Pretence: For he went there, my Lady
&s;ays, to drown him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me! cried Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> laughing;
the Girl's di&s;tracted, &s;ure. Lord! Brother,
don't li&s;ten to her non&s;en&s;ical Tales; we &s;hall
never find my Cou&s;in by her.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="163">
Leave her to me, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> whi&s;|pering:
Perhaps I may di&s;cover &s;omething by her
Di&s;cour&s;e, that will give us &s;ome Light into this
Affair.</P>
<P>Nay, I'll &s;tay, I am re&s;olved, an&s;wered &s;he;
for I long to know where my Cou&s;in is: Tho',
do you think what this Girl &s;ays is true, about
a great Man di&s;gui&s;ed in the Gardens? Sure my
Cou&s;in could never tell her &s;uch Stuff: But,
now I think of it, added &s;he, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI>
when we were &s;peaking about the Jockey,
talked &s;omething about a Lover: I now believe
it is as the Girl &s;ays. Pray let's hear her out.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was ready to die with Vexation,
at the Charmer of his Soul's being thus expo&s;ed;
but there was no Help for it.</P>
<P>Pray, &s;aid he to <HI>Lucy,</HI> tell us no more about
this Man: But, if you can gue&s;s where your
Lady is, let me know.</P>
<P>Indeed I can't, Sir, &s;aid &s;he; for my Lady and
I both &s;tole out of the Hou&s;e, for fear <HI>Edward</HI>
&s;hould break open the Doors of her Apartment;
and we were running as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to my
Brother's Hou&s;e (where &s;he &s;aid &s;he would hide
her&s;elf till you came); but my poor dear Lady
fell down and hurt her&s;elf &s;o much, that &s;he
fainted away: I tried what I could to fetch her
again; but &s;he did not open her Eyes: So I ran
like Lightning to my Brother, to come and help
me to carry her to the Farm; but, when we
came back, &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>What do you &s;ay? cried Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> with
a di&s;tracted Look: Did you leave her in that
Condition in the Fields? And was &s;he not to
be found when you came back?</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="164">
No, indeed, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> weeping, we
could not find her, though we wandered about
a long time.</P>
<P>Oh! Heavens! &s;aid he, walking about the
Room in a violent Emotion, Where can &s;he be?
What is become of her? Dear Si&s;ter, pur&s;ued
he, order &s;omebody to &s;addle my Hor&s;e: I'll
traver&s;e the Country all Night in que&s;t of her.</P>
<P>You had be&s;t inquire, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> if
<HI>Edward</HI> is in the Hou&s;e: He knows, may be,
where my Lady is.</P>
<P>Who is he? cried <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Why the great Man, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> whom
we thought to be a Gardener, who came to
carry my Lady away; which made her get out
of the Hou&s;e as fa&s;t as &s;he could.</P>
<P>This is the &s;trange&s;t Story, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
that ever I heard: Sure nobody would be &s;o
mad to attempt &s;uch an Action; my Cou&s;in has
the odde&s;t Whims!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> not able to li&s;ten any longer,
charged <HI>Lucy</HI> to &s;ay nothing of this Matter to
any one; and then ran eagerly out of the Room,

Woman not near her: The Moon &s;hining very
bright, &s;he looked round her, and called <HI>Lucy</HI>
as loud as &s;he was able; but not &s;eeing her, or
hearing any An&s;wer, her Fears became &s;o power|ful,
that &s;he had like to have relap&s;ed into her
Swoon.</P>
<P>Alas! unfortunate Maid that I am! cried &s;he,
weeping exce&s;&s;ively, que&s;tionle&s;s I am betrayed
by her on who&s;e Fidelity I relied, and who was
acquainted with my mo&s;t &s;ecret Thoughts: She
is now with my Ravi&s;her, directing his Pur&s;uit,
and I have no Means of e&s;caping from his
Hands! Cruel and ungrateful Wench, thy un|paralleled
Treachery grieves me no le&s;s than all
my other Misfortunes: But why do I &s;ay, Her
Treachery is unparalleled? Did not the wicked
<HI>Arianta</HI> betray her Mi&s;tre&s;s into the Power of
her in&s;olent Lover? Ah! <HI>Arabella,</HI> thou art
not &s;ingle in thy Mi&s;ery, &s;ince the divine <HI>Man|dana</HI>
was, like thy&s;elf, the Dupe of a merce|nary
Servant.</P>
<P>Having given a Moment or two to the&s;e &s;ad
Reflections, &s;he ro&s;e from the Ground with an
<PB N="150" REF="166">
Intention to walk on&punc; but her Ancle was &s;o pain|ful,
that &s;he could hardly move: Her Tears began
now to flow with greater Violence: She ex|pected
every Moment to &s;ee <HI>Edward</HI> approach
her; and was re&s;igning her&s;elf up to De&s;pair,
when a Chai&s;e, driven by a young Gentleman,
pa&s;&s;ed by her. <HI>Arabella,</HI> thanking Heaven for
&s;ending this Relief, called out a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> loud as &s;he
could, conjuring him to &s;tay.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, hearing a Woman's Voice,
&s;topped immediately, and a&s;ked what &s;he
wanted.</P>
<P>Generous Stranger, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> advancing as
well as was &s;he able, do not refu&s;e your A&s;&s;i&s;tance
to &s;ave me from a mo&s;t terrible Danger: I am
pur&s;ued by a Per&s;on whom, for very urgent
Rea&s;ons, I de&s;ire to avoid. I conjure you,
therefore, in the Name of her you love be&s;t, to
protect me; and may you be crowned with the
Enjoyment of all your Wi&s;hes, for &s;o charitable
an Action!</P>
<P>If the Gentleman was &s;urpri&s;ed at this Addre&s;s,
he was much more a&s;toni&s;hed at the Beauty of
her who made it: Her Stature; her Shape, her
inimitable Complexion; the Lu&s;tre of her fine
Eyes, and the thou&s;and Charms that adorned
her whole Per&s;on, kept him a Minute &s;ilently
gazing upon her, without having the Power to
make her an An&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> finding he did not &s;peak, was ex|tremely
di&s;appointed. Ah! Sir, &s;aid &s;he,
What do you deliberate upon? Is it po&s;&s;ible
you can deny &s;o rea&s;onable a Reque&s;t, to a
Lady in my Circum&s;tances?</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="167">
For God's &s;ake, Madam, &s;aid the Gentle|man,
alighting, and approaching her, let me
know who you are, and how I can be of any
Service to you.</P>
<P>As for my Quality, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> be a&s;&s;ured
it is not mean; and let this Knowlege &s;uffice at
pre&s;ent: The Service I de&s;ire of you is, to con|vey
me to &s;ome Place where I may be in Safety
for this Night: To-morrow I will intreat you
to let &s;ome Per&s;ons, whom I &s;hall name to you,
know where I am; to the end they may take
proper Mea&s;ures to &s;ecure me from the Attempts
of an in&s;olent Man, who has driven me from
my own Hou&s;e, by the De&s;igns he was going
to execute.</P>
<P>The Gentleman &s;aw there was &s;ome My&s;tery
in her Ca&s;e, which &s;he did not choo&s;e to ex|plain;
and, being extremely glad at having &s;o
beautiful a Creature in his Power, told her &s;he
might command him in all &s;he plea&s;ed; and,
helping her into the Chai&s;e, drove off as fa&s;t as
he could; <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;uffering no Apprehen&s;ions
from being alone with a Stranger, &s;ince nothing
was more common to Heroines than &s;uch Ad|ventures;
all her Fears being of <HI>Edward,</HI> whom
&s;he fan&s;ied every Moment &s;he &s;aw pur&s;uing
them: And, being extremely anxious to be in
&s;ome Place of Safety, &s;he urged her Protector to
drive as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; who, willing to have her
at his own Hou&s;e, complied with her Reque&s;t;
but was &s;o unlucky in his Ha&s;te, as to overturn
the Chai&s;e. Though neither <HI>Arabella</HI> nor him|&s;elf
were hurt by the Fall, yet the Nece&s;&s;ity
there was to &s;tay &s;ome time to put the Chai&s;e
in a Condition to carry them any farther, filled
<PB N="152" REF="168">
her with a thou&s;and Apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t they
&s;hould be overtaken.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Servants of <HI>Arabella,</HI>
among whom <HI>Edward,</HI> not knowing how much
he was concerned in her Flight, was re&s;olved
to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by his Zeal in &s;earching
for her, had di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves about in dif|ferent
Places: Chance conducted <HI>Edward</HI> to
the very Spot where &s;he was: When <HI>Arabella,</HI>
perceiving him while he was two or three
Paces off, Oh! Sir, cried &s;he, behold my
Per&s;ecutor! Can you re&s;olve to defend me
again&s;t the Violence he comes to offer me?</P>
<P>The Gentleman, looking up, and &s;eeing a
Man in Livery approaching them, a&s;ked her, If
that was the Per&s;on &s;he complained of; and
if he was her Servant?</P>
<P>If he is my Servant, Sir, replied &s;he, blu&s;h|ing,
he never had my Permi&s;&s;ion to be &s;o: And,
indeed, no one el&s;e can boa&s;t of my having
granted them &s;uch a Liberty.</P>
<P>Do you know who&s;e Servant he is, then,
Madam? replied the Gentleman, a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed
at her An&s;wer; which he could not well
under&s;tand.</P>
<P>You throw me into a great Embarra&s;&s;ment,
Sir, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> blu&s;hing more than be|fore:
Que&s;tionle&s;s, he appears to be mine;
but, &s;ince, as I told you before, he never di&s;|covered
him&s;elf to me, and I never permitted
him to a&s;&s;ume that Title, his Services, if ever I
received any from him, were not at all con&s;idered
by me, as Things for which I was obliged to
him.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="169">
The Gentleman, &s;till more amazed at An|&s;wers
&s;o little to the Purpo&s;e, was going to de|&s;ire
her to explain her&s;elf upon this &s;trange Af|fair;
when <HI>Edward,</HI> coming up clo&s;e to <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
cried out in a Tran&s;port, Oh! Madam!
thank God you are found.</P>
<P>Hold, impious Man! &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> and do
not give Thanks for that which, haply, may
prove thy Puni&s;hment. If I am found, thou
wilt be no better for it: And, if thou continue&s;t
to per&s;ecute me, thou wilt probably meet with
thy Death, where thou thinke&s;t thou ha&s;t found
thy Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The poor Fellow, who under&s;tood not a
Word of this Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;tared upon her like
one that had lo&s;t his Wits; when the Protector
of <HI>Arabella,</HI> approaching him, a&s;ked him, with
a &s;tern Look, What he had to &s;ay to that
Lady, and why he pre&s;umed to follow her?</P>
<P>As the Man was going to an&s;wer him, Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> came galloping up; and <HI>Edward,</HI> &s;ee|ing
him, ran up to him, and informed him,
that he had met with Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> and a Gentle|man,
who &s;eemed to have been overturned in a
Chai&s;e, which he was endeavouring to refit;
and that her Lady&s;hip was offended with him
for coming up to her; and al&s;o, that the Gen|tleman
had u&s;ed &s;ome threatening Language to
him upon that Account.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively &s;urpri&s;ed at what
he heard, &s;topped; and, ordering a Servant who
came along with him, to run back to the
Ca&s;tle, and bring a Chai&s;e thither to carry Lady
<HI>Bella</HI> home, he a&s;ked <HI>Edward</HI> &s;everal more
Que&s;tions relating to what &s;he and the Gentle|man
<PB N="154" REF="170">
had &s;aid to him: And, notwith&s;tanding
his Knowlege of her ridiculous Humour, he
could not help being alarmed by her Behaviour,
nor concluding that there was &s;omething very
my&s;terious in the Affair.</P>
<P>While he was thus conver&s;ing with <HI>Edward,
Arabella,</HI> who had &s;pied him almo&s;t as &s;oon,
was filled with Apprehen&s;ion to &s;ee him hold &s;o
quiet a Parly with her Ravi&s;her: The more &s;he
reflected upon this Accident, the more her Su|&s;picions
increa&s;ed; and, per&s;uading her&s;elf at
la&s;t, that Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was privy to his
De&s;igns, this Belief, however improbable,
wrought &s;o powerfully upon her Imagination,
that &s;he could not re&s;train her Tears.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, I am betrayed, and the
perjured <HI>Glanville</HI> is no longer either my Friend
or Lover: He is this Moment concerting Mea|&s;ures
with my Ravi&s;her, how to deliver me into
his Power; and, like <HI>Philida&s;pes,</HI> is glad of an
Opportunity, by this Treachery, to be rid of a
Woman whom his Parents and hers had de&s;tined
for his Wife.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> having learned all he could
from <HI>Edward,</HI> alighted; and, giving him his
Hor&s;e to hold, came up to <HI>Arabella:</HI> And, after
expre&s;&s;ing his Joy at meeting with her, begged
her to let him know what Accident had brought
her, unattended, from the Ca&s;tle, at that time
of Night.</P>
<P>If by this Que&s;tion, &s;aid the incen&s;ed <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
you would per&s;uade me you are ignorant
of the Cau&s;e of my Flight, know, your Di&s;&s;imu|lation
will not &s;ucceed; and that, having Rea&s;on
to believe you are equally guilty with him from
<PB N="155" REF="171">
who&s;e intended Violence I fled, I &s;hall have re|cour&s;e
to the Valour of this Knight you &s;ee with
me, to defend me, as well again&s;t you, as that
Ravi&s;her, with whom I &s;ee you leagued.&mdash;Ah!
unworthy Cou&s;in, pur&s;ued &s;he, What do&s;t thou
propo&s;e to thy&s;elf by &s;o black a Treachery?
What is to be the Price of my Liberty, which
thou &s;o freely di&s;po&s;e&s;t of? Has thy Friend
there, &s;aid &s;he (pointing to <HI>Edward</HI>), a Si&s;ter,
or any Relation, for whom thou bartere&s;t, by
delivering me up to him? But, a&s;&s;ure thy&s;elf,
this Stratagem &s;hall be of no U&s;e to thee: For,
if thou art ba&s;e enough to oppre&s;s my valiant
Deliverer with Numbers, and thinke&s;t, by Vio|lence,
to get me into thy Power, my Cries
&s;hall arm Heaven and Earth in my Defence.
Providence may, haply, &s;end &s;ome generous
Cavaliers to my Re&s;cue; and, if Providence fails
me, my own Hand &s;hall give me Freedom; for
that Moment thou offere&s;t to &s;eize me, that
Moment &s;hall be the la&s;t of my Life.</P>
<P>While <HI>Arabella</HI> was &s;peaking, the young Gentle|man
and <HI>Edward,</HI> who li&s;tened to her, eagerly,
thought her Brain was di&s;turbed: But Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> was in a terrible Con&s;u&s;ion, and &s;i|lently
cur&s;ed his ill Fate, to make him in
Love with a Woman &s;o ridiculous.</P>
<P>For Heaven's &s;ake, Cou&s;in, &s;aid he, &s;triving
to repre&s;s &s;ome Part of his Di&s;order, Do not
give way to the&s;e extravagant Notions: There is
nobody intends to do you any Wrong.</P>
<P>What! interrupted &s;he, would you per&s;uade
me, that that Impo&s;tor there, pointing to <HI>Ed|ward,</HI>
has not a De&s;ign to carry me away;
<PB N="156" REF="172">
which you, by &s;upporting him, are not equally
guilty of?</P>
<P>Who? I! Madam! cried out <HI>Edward:</HI> Sure
your Lady&s;hip does not &s;u&s;pect me of &s;uch a
&s;trange De&s;ign! God knows I never thought of
&s;uch a Thing!</P>
<P>Ah! Di&s;&s;embler! interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> do
not make u&s;e of that &s;acred Name to ma&s;k thy
impious Fal&s;hoods: Confe&s;s with what Intent
you came into my Father's Service di&s;gui&s;ed.</P>
<P>I never came di&s;gui&s;ed, Madam, returned
<HI>Edward.</HI></P>
<P>No! &s;aid <HI>Arabella:</HI> What means that Dre&s;s
in which I &s;ee you, then?</P>
<P>'Tis the Marquis's Livery, Madam, &s;aid
<HI>Edward,</HI> which he did not order to be taken
from me when I left his Service.</P>
<P>And with what Purpo&s;e did&s;t thou wear it?
&s;aid &s;he, Do not your Thoughts accu&s;e you of
your Crime?</P>
<P>I always hoped, Madam&mdash;&s;aid he.</P>
<P>You hoped! interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> frowning,
Did I ever give you Rea&s;on to hope? I will not
deny but I had Compa&s;&s;ion on you; but even
That you was ignorant of.</P>
<P>I know, Madam, you had Compa&s;&s;ion on
me, &s;aid <HI>Edward;</HI> for your Lady&s;hip, I always
thought, did not believe me guilty.</P>
<P>I was weak enough, &s;aid &s;he, to have Com|pa&s;&s;ion
on you, though I <HI>did</HI> believe you guilty.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, returned <HI>Edward,</HI> I al|ways
hoped, as I &s;aid before (but your Lady&s;hip
would not hear me out), that you did not be|lieve
any malicious Reports; and therefore you
had Compa&s;&s;ion on me.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="173">
I had no Reports of you, &s;aid &s;he, but what
my own Ob&s;ervation gave me; and that was
&s;ufficient to convince me of your Fault.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Edward,</HI> did your Lady|&s;hip
&s;ee me &s;teal the Carp then, which was the
Fault unju&s;tly laid to my Charge?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> as much Cau&s;e as he had for
Unea&s;ine&s;s, could with great Difficulty re&s;train
Laughter at this ludicrous Circum&s;tance; for he
gue&s;&s;ed what Crime <HI>Arabella</HI> was accu&s;ing him
of: As for the young Gentleman, he could not
conceive what &s;he meant, and longed to hear
what would be the End of &s;uch a &s;trange Con|ference.
But poor <HI>Arabella</HI> was prodigiou&s;ly
confounded at his mentioning &s;o low an Affair;
not being able to endure that <HI>Glanville</HI> and
her Protector &s;hould know a Lover of her's
could be &s;u&s;pected of &s;o ba&s;e a Theft.</P>
<P>The Shame &s;he conceived at it, kept her
&s;ilent for a Moment: But, recovering her&s;elf at
la&s;t, No, &s;aid &s;he, I knew you better than to
give any Credit to &s;uch an idle Report: Per&s;ons
of your Condition do not commit &s;uch paltry
Crimes.</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Madam, &s;aid the young
Gentleman, Per&s;ons of his Condition often do
wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I don't deny it, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella;</HI> and the
De&s;ign he meditated of carrying me away was
infinitely wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Really, Madam, returned the Gentleman,
if you are &s;uch a Per&s;on as I apprehend, I
don't &s;ee how he dur&s;t make &s;uch an At|tempt.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="174">
It is very po&s;&s;ible, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, that I might
be carried away, though I was of greater Qua|lity
than I am: Were not <HI>Mandana, Candace,
Clelia,</HI> and many other Ladies who underwent
the &s;ame Fate, of a Quality more illu&s;trious
than mine?</P>
<P>Really, Madam, &s;aid he, I know none of
the&s;e Ladies.</P>
<P>No, Sir! &s;aid <HI>Arabella;</HI> extremely mortified.</P>
<P>Let me intreat you, Cou&s;in, interrupted <HI>Glan|ville</HI>
(who feared this Di&s;pute would be very
tedious), to expo&s;e your&s;elf no longer to the
Air at this time of Night: Suffer me to conduct
you home.</P>
<P>It concerns my Honour, &s;aid &s;he, that this
generous Stranger &s;hould not think I am the
only one that was ever expo&s;ed to the&s;e in&s;olent
Attempts. You &s;ay, Sir, pur&s;ued &s;he, that
you don't know any of the&s;e Ladies I mention|ed
before: Let me a&s;k you, then, If you are
acquainted with <HI>Partheni&s;&s;a,</HI> or <HI>Cleopatra?</HI> who
were both, for &s;ome Months, in the Hands of
their Ravi&s;hers.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Partheni&s;&s;a,</HI> Madam, neither have I heard
of her; nor do I remember to have heard of
any more than one <HI>Cleopatra:</HI> But &s;he was never
ravi&s;hed, I am certain; for &s;he was too willing.</P>
<P>How! Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella:</HI> Was <HI>Cleopatra</HI>
ever willing to run away with her Ravi&s;her?</P>
<P><HI>Cleopatra</HI> was a Whore, was &s;he not, Madam?
&s;aid he.</P>
<P>Hold thy Peace, unworthy Man, &s;aid <HI>Ara|bella;</HI>
and profane not the Memory of that fair
and glorious Queen, by &s;uch injurious Lan|guage:
That Queen, I &s;ay, who&s;e Courage was
<PB N="159" REF="175">
equal to her Beauty; and her Virtue &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
by neither. Good Heavens! What a black
Defamer have I cho&s;en for my Protector!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> rejoicing to &s;ee <HI>Arabella</HI> in a
Di&s;po&s;ition to be offended with her new Ac|quaintance,
re&s;olved to &s;ooth her a little, in
hopes of prevailing upon her to return home.
Sir, &s;aid he to the Gentleman, who could not
conceive why the Lady &s;hould &s;o warmly de|fend
<HI>Cleopatra,</HI> you were in the Wrong to ca&s;t
&s;uch Reflections upon that great Queen (re|peating
what he had heard his Cou&s;in &s;ay be|fore):
For all the World, pur&s;ued he, knows
&s;he was married to <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>Though I commend you, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> for
taking the Part of a Lady &s;o ba&s;ely vilified; yet
let not your Zeal for her Honour induce you
to &s;ay more than is true for its Ju&s;tification;
for thereby you weaken, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening,
what may be &s;aid in her Defence. One
Fal&s;hood always &s;uppo&s;es another, and renders
all you can &s;ay &s;u&s;pected: Whereas pure, un|mixed
Truth, carries Conviction along with it,
and never fails to produce its de&s;ired Effect.</P>
<P>Suffer me, Cou&s;in, interrupted <HI>Glanville,</HI> to
repre&s;ent to you, the Inconveniency you will
certainly feel, by &s;taying &s;o late in the Air:
Leave the Ju&s;tification of <HI>Cleopatra</HI> to &s;ome
other Opportunity; and take care of your own
Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>What is it you require of me? &s;aid <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Only, re&s;umed <HI>Glanville,</HI> that you would be
plea&s;ed to return to the Ca&s;tle, where my Si&s;ter,
and all your Servants, are incon&s;olable for your
Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="176">
But who can a&s;&s;ure me, an&s;wered &s;he, that
I &s;hall not, by returning home, enter volunta|rily
into my Pri&s;on? For, to &s;ay the Truth,
I &s;till more than &s;u&s;pect you abet the De&s;igns
of this Man; &s;ince I behold you in his Party,
and ready, no doubt, to draw your Sword in
his Defence: How will you be able to clear
your&s;elf of this Crime? Yet I will venture to
return to my Hou&s;e, provided you will &s;wear
to me, you will offer me no Violence, with
regard to your Friend there: And al&s;o I in&s;i&s;t,
that he, from this Moment, di&s;claim all Inten|tions
of per&s;ecuting me, and bani&s;h him&s;elf
from my Pre&s;ence for ever. Upon this Con|dition
I pardon him, and will likewi&s;e pray to
Heaven to pardon him al&s;o. Speak, pre&s;ump|tuous
Unknown, &s;aid &s;he to <HI>Edward,</HI> Wilt
thou accept of my Pardon upon the Terms I
offer it thee? And wilt thou take thy&s;elf to &s;ome
Place where I may never behold thee again?</P>
<P>Since your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid <HI>Edward,</HI> is re&s;olved
not to receive me into your Service, I &s;han't
trouble you any more: But I think it hard to
be puni&s;hed for a Crime I was not guilty of.</P>
<P>'Tis better, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> turning from him,
that thou &s;hould&s;t complain of my Rigour, than
the World tax me with Lightne&s;s and Indi&s;cre|tion.
And now, Sir, &s;aid &s;he to <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
mu&s;t tru&s;t my&s;elf to your Honour, which I con|fe&s;s
I do a little &s;u&s;pect: But, however, 'tis
po&s;&s;ible you have repented, like the poor Prince
<HI>Thra&s;ybulus,</HI> when he &s;ubmitted to the Sug|ge&s;tions
of a wicked Friend, to carry away the
fair <HI>Alcionida,</HI> whom he afterwards re&s;tored.
Speak, <HI>Glanville,</HI> pur&s;ued &s;he, are you de&s;irous
<PB N="161" REF="177">
of imitating that virtuous Prince, or do you
&s;till retain your former Sentiments?</P>
<P>Upon my Word, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI>
you will make me quite mad, if you go on in
this manner: Pray let me &s;ee you &s;afe home;
and then, if you plea&s;e, you may forbid my
Entrance into the Ca&s;tle, if you &s;u&s;pect me of
any bad Intentions towards you.</P>
<P>'Tis enough, &s;aid &s;he; I will tru&s;t you. As
for you, Sir, &s;peaking to the young Gentleman,
you are &s;o unworthy, in my Apprehen&s;ions, by
the Calumnies you have uttered again&s;t a Per|&s;on
of that Sex which merits all your Admira|tion
and Reverence, that I hold you very unfit
to be a Protector of any of it: Therefore I
di&s;pen&s;e with your Services upon this Occa&s;ion;
and think it better to tru&s;t my&s;elf to the Conduct
of a Per&s;on, who, like <HI>Thra&s;ybulus,</HI> by his Re|pentance,
has re&s;tored him&s;elf to my Confi|dence,
than to one, who, though, indeed, he
has never betrayed me, yet &s;eems very capable
of doing &s;o, if he had the Power.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he gave her Hand to <HI>Glanville,</HI>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Two Conver&s;ations, out of which the
Reader may pick up a great deal.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>_ARABELLA,</HI> continuing to rumi|nate
upon her Adventure during
their little Journey, appeared &s;o
low and re&s;erved, that Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
tho' he ardently wi&s;hed to
know all the Particulars of her Flight, and
Meeting with that Gentleman, who&s;e Com|pany
he found her in, was obliged to &s;uppre&s;s
his Curio&s;ity for the pre&s;ent, out of a Fear of
di&s;plea&s;ing her. As &s;oon as they alighted at the
<PB N="164" REF="179">
Ca&s;tle, her Servants ran to receive her at the
Gates, expre&s;&s;ing their Joy to &s;ee her again, by
a thou&s;and confu&s;ed Exclamations.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> being at her Toilet when &s;he
heard of her Arrival, ran down to welcome her,
in her Hurry forgetting, that as her Woman had
been curling her Hair, &s;he had no Cap on.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> received her Compliments with a
little Coolne&s;s; for, ob&s;erving that her Grief
for her Ab&s;ence had not made her neglect any
of her u&s;ual Solicitude about her Per&s;on, &s;he
could not conceive it had been very great: There|fore,
when &s;he had made &s;ome &s;light An&s;wer
to the hundred Que&s;tions &s;he a&s;ked in a Breath,
&s;he went up to her Apartment; and, calling
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who was crying with Joy for her Return,
&s;he que&s;tioned her &s;trictly concerning her
leaving her in the Fields, acknowleging to
her, that &s;he &s;u&s;pected her Fidelity, tho' &s;he
wi&s;hed, at the &s;ame time, &s;he might be able to
clear her&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> in her Ju&s;tification, related, after her
punctual Way, all that had happened: By
which, <HI>Arabella</HI> was convinced &s;he had not be|trayed
her; and was al&s;o in &s;ome Doubt, whe|ther
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was guilty of any De&s;ign
again&s;t her.</P>
<P>Since, &s;aid &s;he to <HI>Lucy,</HI> thou art re&s;tored to
my good Opinion, I will, as I have always
done, unma&s;k my Thoughts to thee. I con|fe&s;s
then, with Shame and Confu&s;ion, that I
cannot think of Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Un|known
to carry me away, without <HI>re&s;enting</HI> a
mo&s;t poignant Grief: Que&s;tionle&s;s, my Weak|ne&s;s
will &s;urpri&s;e thee; and could I conceal it
<PB N="165" REF="180">
from my&s;elf, I would from thee; but, alas! it is
certain, that I do not hate him; and I believe
I never &s;hall, guilty as he may be in my Appre|hen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Hate him! Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy:</HI> God forbid
you &s;hould ever hate Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who, I am
&s;ure, loves your Lady&s;hip as well as he does his
own Si&s;ter!</P>
<P>You are very confident, <HI>Lucy,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Arabella</HI>
blu&s;hing, to mention the Word Love to me:
If I thought my Cou&s;in had bribed thee to it, I
&s;hould be greatly incen&s;ed: However, tho' I
forbid you to talk of his Pa&s;&s;ion, yet I permit
you to tell me the Violence of his Tran&s;|ports
when I was mi&s;&s;ing; the Threats he ut|tered
again&s;t my Ravi&s;hers; the Complaints
he made again&s;t Fortune; the Vows he of|fered
for my Pre&s;ervation; and, in fine,
whatever Extravagances the Exce&s;s of his Sor|row
forced him to commit.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> I did not
hear him &s;ay any of all this.</P>
<P>What! interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> And did&s;t thou
not ob&s;erve the Tears trickle from his Eyes,
which, haply, he &s;trove to conceal? Did he
not &s;trike his Bo&s;om with the Vehemence of
his Grief; and ca&s;t his accu&s;ing and de&s;pairing
Eyes to Heaven, which had permitted &s;uch a
Misfortune to befal me?</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, I did not, re&s;umed <HI>Lucy;</HI>
but he &s;eemed to be very &s;orry; and &s;aid, He
would go and look for your Lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>Ah! the Traitor! interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> in a
Rage: Fain would I have found out &s;ome Ex|cu&s;e
for him, and ju&s;tified him in my Appre|hen&s;ions;
<PB N="166" REF="181">
but he is unworthy of the&s;e &s;avourable
Thoughts: Speak of him no more, I command
you; he is guilty of a&s;&s;ii&s;ting my Ravi&s;her to
carry me away; and therefore merits my eter|nal
Di&s;plea&s;ure: But tho' I could find Rea&s;ons
to clear him even of that Crime, yet he is guilty
of Indifference and In&s;en&s;ibility for my Lo&s;s,
&s;ince he neither died with Grief at the News of
it; nor needed the Interpo&s;ition of his Si&s;ter, or
the De&s;ire of delivering me, to make him live.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> when &s;he had &s;aid this, was &s;ilent;
but could not prevent &s;ome Tears &s;tealing down
her fair Face: Therefore, to conceal her Un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
or to be at more Liberty to indulge it,
&s;he ordered <HI>Lucy</HI> to make ha&s;te and undre&s;s
her; and, going To-bed, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;mall Re|mainder
of the Night, not in Re&s;t, which &s;he
very much needed, but, in Reflections on all
the Pa&s;&s;ages of the preceding Day: And, finding,
or imagining &s;he found, new Rea&s;ons for con|demning
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> her Mind was very
far from being at Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Morning, lying later than u&s;ual, &s;he
received a Me&s;&s;age from Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> in|quiring
after her Health; to which &s;he an|&s;wered,
That he was too little concerned in the
Pre&s;ervation of it, to make it nece&s;&s;ary to ac|quaint
him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> &s;oon after &s;ent to de&s;ire Per|mi&s;&s;ion
to drink her Chocolate by her Bed&s;ide;
which as &s;he could not in Civility refu&s;e, &s;he
was very much perplexed how to hide her Mel|ancholy
from the Eyes of that di&s;cerning Lady,
who, &s;he que&s;tioned not, would interpret it
in favour of her Brother.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="182">
Upon Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Appearance, &s;he forced
her&s;elf to a&s;&s;ume a chearful Look, a&s;king her
Pardon, for receiving her in Bed; and com|plaining
of bad Re&s;t, which had occa&s;ioned her
lying late.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> after an&s;wering her Compli|ments
with almo&s;t equal Politene&s;s, proceeded
to a&s;k her an hundred Que&s;tions concerning
the Cau&s;e of her Ab&s;ence from the Ca&s;tle: Your
Woman, pur&s;ued &s;he, laughing, told us a &s;trange
Medley of Stuff about a great Man, who was a
Gardener; and wanted to carry you away:
Sure there was nothing in it! Was there?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t excu&s;e me, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
if I do not an&s;wer your Que&s;tions preci&s;ely now:
'Tis &s;ufficient that I tell you, Certain Rea&s;ons
obliged me to act in the Manner I did, for my
own Pre&s;ervation; and that, another time, you
&s;hall know my Hi&s;tory; which will explain
many things you &s;eem to be &s;urpri&s;ed at, at
pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Your Hi&s;tory, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville!</HI> Why,
will you write your own Hi&s;tory then?</P>
<P>I &s;hall not write it, &s;aid <HI>Arabella;</HI> tho', que|&s;tionle&s;s,
it will be written after my Death.</P>
<P>And mu&s;t I wait till then for it, re&s;umed
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> gaily?</P>
<P>No, no, interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> I mean to
gratify your Curio&s;ity &s;ooner; but it will not be
yet a good time; and, haply, not till you have
acquainted me with yours.</P>
<P>Mine! &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville:</HI> It would not be
worth your hearing; for really I have nothing
to tell, that would make an Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="183">
You have, que&s;tionle&s;s, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI>
gained many Victories over Hearts; have oc|ca&s;ioned
many Quarrels between your Servants,
by favouring &s;ome one, more than the others:
Probably, you have cau&s;ed &s;ome Blood&s;hed;
and have not e&s;caped being carried away once
or twice: You have al&s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, undergone
&s;ome Per&s;ecution, from tho&s;e who have the
Di&s;po&s;al of you, in Favour of a Lover whom
you have an Aver&s;ion to; and la&s;tly, there is
haply &s;ome one among your Admirers, who
is happy enough not to be hated by you.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I hate
none of my Admirers; and I can't help think|ing
you very unkind to u&s;e my Brother as you
do: I am &s;ure, there is not one Man in an hun|dred,
that would take &s;o much from your Hands
as he does.</P>
<P>Then there is not one Man in an hundred,
re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> whom I &s;hould think worthy
to &s;erve me: But, pray, Madam, What ill
U&s;age is it your Brother complains of? I have
treated him with much le&s;s Severity than he had
Rea&s;on to expect; and, notwith&s;tanding he had
the Pre&s;umption to talk to me of Love, I have
endured him in my Sight; an Indulgence, for
which I may haply be blamed in After-ages.</P>
<P>Why, &s;ure, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
it would be no &s;uch Crime for my Brother to
love you!</P>
<P>But it was a mortal Crime to tell me &s;o, in|terrupted
<HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>And why was it &s;uch a mortal Crime to tell
you &s;o, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville?</HI> Are you the fir&s;t
Woman by Millions, that has been told &s;o?</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="184">
Doubtle&s;s, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI> I am the fir&s;t
Woman of my Quality, that ever was told &s;o
by any Man, till after an infinite Number of
Services, and &s;ecret Sufferings: And truly, I
am of the illu&s;trious <HI>Mandana</HI>'s Mind; for &s;he
&s;aid, That &s;he &s;hould think it an unpardonable
Pre&s;umption, for the greate&s;t King on Earth to
tell her he loved her, tho' after Ten Years of the
mo&s;t faithful Services, and concealed Tor|ments.</P>
<P>Ten Years! cried out Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> in
Amazement; Did &s;he con&s;ider what Altera|tions
ten Years would make in her Face, and
how much older &s;he would be at the End of
Ten Years, than &s;he was before?</P>
<P>Truly, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> it is not u&s;ual to con&s;i|der
&s;uch little Matters &s;o nicely; one never has
the Idea of an Heroine older than Eighteen,
tho' her Hi&s;tory begins at that Age; and the
Events, which compo&s;e it, contain the Space
of Twenty more.</P>
<P>But, dear Cou&s;in, re&s;umed Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
do you re&s;olve to be Ten Years a courting? Or
rather, will you be loved in Silence Ten Years,
and be courted the other Ten; and &s;o marry
when you are an old Woman?</P>
<P>Pardon me, Cou&s;in, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella;</HI> I
mu&s;t really find Fault with the Coar&s;ene&s;s of
your Language. Courting, and Old Woman!
What &s;trange Terms! Let us, I be&s;eech you,
end this Di&s;pute: If you have any thing to &s;ay in
Ju&s;tification of your Brother, which, I &s;uppo&s;e,
was the chief Intention of your Vi&s;it, I &s;hall not
be rude enough to re&s;train you; tho' I could
wi&s;h you would not lay me under the Nece&s;|&s;ity
<PB N="170" REF="185">
of hearing what I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf
to believe.</P>
<P>Since, returned Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I know of
no Crime my Brother has been guilty of, I have
nothing to &s;ay in his Ju&s;tification: I only know,
that he is very much mortified at the Me&s;&s;age
you &s;ent him this Morning; for I was with him
when he received it: But pray, What has he
done to offend you?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> hopes
for my Pardon, he mu&s;t purcha&s;e it by his Re|pentance,
and a &s;incere Confe&s;&s;ion of his Fault;
which you may much better under&s;tand from
him&s;elf, than from me: And, for this Purpo&s;e,
I will conde&s;cend to grant him a private Au|dience,
at which I de&s;ire you would be pre&s;ent;
and al&s;o, I &s;hould take it well, if you will let
him know, that he owes this Favour wholly to
your Interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who knew her Brother was
extremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing <HI>Arabella,</HI> was glad
to accept of the&s;e &s;trange Terms; and left her
Chamber, in order to acquaint him with that
Lady's Intentions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;olemn Interview.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the mean time, that Fair-one, being ri&s;en,
and negligently dre&s;&s;ed, as was her Cu&s;tom,
went into her Clo&s;et, &s;ending to give Mi&s;s
<PB N="171" REF="186">
<HI>Glanville</HI> Notice, That &s;he was ready to &s;ee her.
This Me&s;&s;age immediately brought both the
Brother and the Si&s;ter to her Apartment: And
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> at her Brother's Reque&s;t, &s;tay|ing
in the Chamber, where &s;he bu&s;ied her&s;elf
in looking at her Cou&s;in's Jewels, which lay
upon the Toilet, he came alone into the Clo|&s;et,
in &s;o much Confu&s;ion at the Thoughts of
the ridiculous Figure he made in complying
with <HI>Arabella</HI>'s fanta&s;tical Humours, that his
Looks per&s;uading her, there was &s;ome great
Agitation in his Mind, &s;he expected to &s;ee him
fall at her Feet, and endeavour to deprecate
her Wrath by a Deluge of Tears.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> however di&s;appointed her in
that re&s;pect; for, taking a Seat near her, he
began to intreat, her with a &s;miling Counte|nance,
to tell him in what he had offended her;
prote&s;ting, that he was not con&s;cious of doing
or &s;aying any thing to di&s;plea&s;e her.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was greatly confu&s;ed at this Que&s;tion,
which &s;he thought &s;he had no Rea&s;on to expect;
it not being po&s;&s;ible for her to tell him &s;he was
offended, that he was not in ab&s;olute De&s;pair for
her Ab&s;ence, without, at the &s;ame time, confe&s;&s;ing
&s;he looked upon him in the Light of a Lover,
who&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions of a violent Pa&s;&s;ion would not
have di&s;plea&s;ed her: Therefore, to di&s;engage
her&s;elf from the Perplexity his Que&s;tion threw
her into, &s;he was obliged to offer &s;ome Violence
to her Ingenuou&s;ne&s;s; and, contrary to her real
Belief, tax him again with a De&s;ign of betray|ing
her into the Power of the Unknown.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho' exce&s;&s;ively vexed at her
per&s;i&s;ting in &s;o ridiculous an Error, could hardly
<PB N="172" REF="187">
help &s;miling at the &s;tern Manner in which &s;he
&s;poke; but, knowing of what fatal Con&s;equence
it would be to him, if he indulged any Gaiety
in &s;o &s;olemn a Conference, he compo&s;ed his
Looks to a Gravity &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion;
and a&s;ked her, in a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Tone, What
Motive &s;he was plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign for &s;o extra|ordinary
a Piece of Villainy, as that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed
him guilty of?</P>
<P>Truly, an&s;wered &s;he, blu&s;hing, I do not pre|tend
to account for the Actions of wicked and
ungenerous Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But, Madam, re&s;umed <HI>Glanville,</HI> if I mu&s;t needs
be &s;u&s;pected of a De&s;ign to &s;eize upon your Per|&s;on,
methinks it would have been more rea|&s;onable
to &s;uppo&s;e, I would rather u&s;e that Vio|lence
in Favour of my own Preten&s;ions, than
tho&s;e of any other whatever; for, tho' you have
expre&s;ly forbid me to tell you I love you, yet
I hope, you &s;till continue to think I do.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI> a&s;&s;uming a
&s;evere Look, I never gave my&s;elf the Trouble to
examine your Behaviour with Care enough to
be &s;en&s;ible, if you &s;till were guilty of the Weak|ne&s;s,
which di&s;plea&s;ed me; but, upon a Suppo|&s;ition,
that you repented of your Fault, I was
willing to live with you upon Terms of Civi|lity
and Friend&s;hip, as became Per&s;ons in that
Degree of Relation&s;hip in which we are: There|fore,
if you are wi&s;e, you will not renew the Re|membrance
of tho&s;e Follies I have long &s;ince
pardoned; nor &s;eek Occa&s;ions of offending me
by new ones of the &s;ame kind, le&s;t it produce a
more &s;evere Sentence than that I formerly laid
upon you.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="188">
However, Madam, returned Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
you mu&s;t &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;ure you, That my own
Intere&s;t, which was greatly concerned in your
Safety, and my Principles of Honour, would
never allow me to engage in &s;o villainous an
Enterprize, as that of abetting any Per&s;on in
&s;tealing you away: Nor can I conceive, how
you po&s;&s;ibly could imagine a Fellow, who was
your menial Servant, could form &s;o pre&s;ump|tuous
and dangerous a De&s;ign.</P>
<P>By your Manner of &s;peaking, re&s;umed <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
one would imagine you were really igno|rant,
both of the Quality of that pre&s;umptuous
Man, as well as his de&s;igned Offence: But
yet, 'tis certain, I &s;aw you in his Company;
and &s;aw you ready to draw your Sword in his
Defence, again&s;t my Deliverer. Had I not the
Evidence of my own Sen&s;es, for your Guilt, I
mu&s;t confe&s;s, I could not be per&s;uaded of it by
any other Means: Therefore, &s;ince Appear|ances
are certainly again&s;t you, it is not &s;trange, if
I cannot con&s;ent to acquit you in my Apprehen|ons,
till I have more certain Confirmation of
your Innocence, than your bare Te&s;timony only;
which, at pre&s;ent, has not all the Weight with
me it had &s;ome time ago.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who
was &s;trangely perplexed, I have Rea&s;on to think
my Ca&s;e extremely hard, &s;ince I have brought
my&s;elf to be &s;u&s;pected by you, only through my
Eagerne&s;s to find you, and Solicitude for your
Welfare.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> if you are
innocent, your Ca&s;e is extremely hard; yet
it is not &s;ingular; and therefore you have
<PB N="174" REF="189">
le&s;s Rea&s;on to complain: The valiant <HI>Corio|lanus,</HI>
who was the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and faith|ful
Lover imaginable, having, by his admira|ble
Valour, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Ravi&s;hers of his adored
<HI>Cleopatra,</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e who came to re&s;cue her;
and, by his Arm alone, oppo&s;ed to great Num|bers
of their Enemies, facilitated the Execuion
of their De&s;ign, had the Mortification after|wards
to know, that he had, all that time,
been fighting again&s;t that Divine Prince&s;s, who
loaded him with the mo&s;t cruel Reproaches for
the Injury he had done her: Yet Fortune was
&s;o kind, as to give him the Means of repairing
his Fault, and re&s;toring him to &s;ome Part of
her good Opinion; for, covered with Wounds
as he was, and fatigued with fighting, before,
yet he undertook, in that Condition, to pre|vent
her Ravi&s;hers from carrying her off; and,
for &s;everal Hours, continued fighting alone with
near Two hundred Men, who were not able to
overcome him, notwith&s;tanding his extreme
Wearine&s;s, and the Multitude of Blows which
they aimed at him: Therefore, <HI>Glanville,</HI> con|&s;idering
you, as <HI>Cleopatra</HI> did that unfortunate
Prince, who was before &s;u&s;pected by her, as
neither guilty nor innocent, I can only, like her,
wi&s;h you may find &s;ome Occa&s;ion of ju&s;tifying
your&s;elf, from the Crime laid to your Charge:
Till then, I mu&s;t be under a Nece&s;&s;ity of bani&s;h|ing
you from my Pre&s;ence, with the &s;ame con|&s;olatory
Speech &s;he u&s;ed to that unfortunate
Prince:&mdash;<Q>Go, therefore, <HI>Glanville,</HI> go, and
endeavour your own Ju&s;tification; I de&s;ire
you &s;hould effect it, no le&s;s than you do your|&s;elf;
and, if my Prayers can obtain from
<PB N="175" REF="190">
Heaven this Favour for you, I &s;hall not
&s;cruple to offer &s;ome <HI>in your behalf.</HI></Q></P>

<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> when &s;he had pronounced

&s;he had &s;aid too much: But, not &s;eeing

the Authors of tho&s;e Romances, that had ruined

of &s;eeing you, and &s;ending me on a Wild-goo&s;e
Chace, after Occa&s;ions to ju&s;tify my&s;elf of a
Crime I am wholly innocent of, and would
&s;corn to commit?</P>
<P>Though, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> with great Calm|ne&s;s,
I have Rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the
cool and unthankful manner in which you re|ceive
<PB N="176" REF="191">
my Indulgence, yet I &s;hall not change the
favourable Di&s;po&s;ition I am in towards you, un|le&s;s
you provoke me to it by new Acts of Di&s;|obedience:
Therefore, in the Language of
<HI>Cleopatra,</HI> I &s;hall tell you.&mdash;</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Madam, interrupted <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
I have no Patience with that rigorous
Gip&s;y, who&s;e Example you follow &s;o exactly,
to my Sorrow: Speak in your own Language,
I be&s;eech you; for I am &s;ure neither hers,
nor any one's upon Earth, can excel it.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;triving to repre&s;s &s;ome
Inclination to &s;mile at this Sally, notwith&s;tand|ing
your unju&s;t Prohibitions, I &s;hall make u&s;e
of the Language of that incomparable Lady, to
tell you my Thoughts; which are, That 'tis
po&s;&s;ible you might be &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified in my
Apprehen&s;ions, by the Anxiety it now appears
you had for my Safety, by the Probability which
I find in your Di&s;cour&s;e, and the good Opinion
I have of you, were it not requi&s;ite to make
your Innocence apparent to the World, that &s;o
it might be lawful for <HI>Arabella</HI> to readmit you,
with Honour, into her former E&s;teem and
Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;eeing it would be in vain to
attempt to make her alter her fanta&s;tical Deter|mination
at this time, went out of the Clo&s;et
without deigning to make any Reply to his
Sentence, though delivered in the Language of
the admirable <HI>Cleopatra:</HI> But his ill Humour
was &s;o vi&s;ible in his Face, that <HI>Arabella,</HI> who
mi&s;took it for an Exce&s;s of De&s;pair, could not
help feeling &s;ome kind of Pity for the Rigour
which the Laws of Honour and Romance
<PB N="177" REF="192">
obliged her to u&s;e him with. And, while &s;he
&s;at meditating upon the Scene which had
ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> returned to his own
Room, glad that his Si&s;ter, not being in <HI>Ara|bella</HI>'s
Chamber, where he had left her, had no
Opportunity of ob&s;erving his Di&s;content, which
&s;he would not fail to inquire the Cau&s;e of.</P>
<P>Here he &s;at, ruminating upon the Follies of
<HI>Arabella,</HI> which he found grew more glaring
every Day: Every thing furni&s;hed Matter for
&s;ome new Extravagance; her Character was &s;o
ridiculous, that he could propo&s;e nothing to
him&s;elf but eternal Shame and Di&s;quiet, in the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Woman, for whom he mu&s;t
always blu&s;h, and be in Pain. But her Beauty
had made a deep Impre&s;&s;ion on his Heart: He
admired the Strength of her Under&s;tanding;
her lively Wit; the Sweetne&s;s of her Temper;
and a Thou&s;and amiable Qualities which di|&s;tingui&s;hed
her from the re&s;t of her Sex: Her
Follies, when oppo&s;ed to all tho&s;e Charms of
Mind and Per&s;on, &s;eemed incon&s;iderable and
weak; and, though they were capable of giving
him great Unea&s;ine&s;s, yet they could not le&s;&s;en
a Pa&s;&s;ion which every Sight of her &s;o much
the more confirmed.</P>
<P>As he &s;eared it was impo&s;&s;ible to help loving
her, his Happine&s;s depended upon curing her of
her romantic Notions; and, though he knew
not how to effect &s;uch a Change in her as was
nece&s;&s;ary to complete it, yet he would not de|&s;pair,
but com&s;orted him&s;elf with Hopes of
what he had not Courage to attempt. Some|times
he fan&s;ied Company, and an Acquaint|ance
with the World, would produce the Al|teration
<PB N="178" REF="193">
he wi&s;hed: Yet he dreaded to &s;ee her
expo&s;ed to Ridicule by her fanta&s;tical Behaviour,
and become the Je&s;t of Per&s;ons who were not
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of half her Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>While he traver&s;ed his Chamber, wholly
engro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e Reflections, Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>
was entertaining Sir <HI>George,</HI> of who&s;e coming
&s;he was informed while &s;he was in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine is greatly di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MISS <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing her Brother
would be glad not to be interrupted in
his Conference with Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> did not allow
any one to acquaint them with Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
Vi&s;it; and, telling the Baronet her Cou&s;in was
indi&s;po&s;ed, had, by the&s;e means, all his Con|ver&s;ation
to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who ardently wi&s;hed to &s;ee Lady
<HI>Bella,</HI> protracted his Vi&s;it, in hopes that he
&s;hould have that Satisfaction before he went
away. And that fair Lady, who&s;e Thoughts
were a little di&s;compo&s;ed by the De&s;pair &s;he ap|prehended
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was in, and fearful of
the Con&s;equences, when &s;he had &s;at &s;ome time
after he left her, ruminating upon what had
happened, quitted her Clo&s;et, to go and inquire
of Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> in what Condition his Mind
<PB N="179" REF="194">
&s;eemed to be when he went away; for &s;he never
doubted but that he was gone, like <HI>Coriolanus,</HI>
to &s;eek out for &s;ome Occa&s;ion to manife&s;t his
Innocence.</P>
<P>Hearing, therefore, the Voice of that Lady,
who was talking and laughing very loud in one
of the Summer-parlours, and being terrified
with the Apprehen&s;ion, that it was her Brother
with whom &s;he was thus diverting her&s;elf, &s;he
opened the Door of the Room precipitately;
and, by her Entrance, filled Sir <HI>George</HI> with
extreme Plea&s;ure; while her unexpected Sight
produced a quite contrary Effect on Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> ea&s;ed of her Fear, that it was Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> who, in&s;tead of dying with De&s;pair,
was giving Occa&s;ion for that noi&s;y Laugh of his
Si&s;ter, &s;aluted the Baronet with great Civility;
and, turning to Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I mu&s;t needs
chide you, &s;aid &s;he, for the In&s;en&s;ibility with
which it appears you have parted with your
Brother.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me, Madam, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
what do you mean? Whither is my Brother
gone?</P>
<P>That, indeed, I am quite ignorant of, re|&s;umed
<HI>Arabella;</HI> and I &s;uppo&s;e he him&s;elf hard|ly
knows what Cour&s;e he &s;hall take: But he has
been with you, doubtle&s;s, to take his Leave.</P>
<P>Take his Leave! repeated Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville:</HI>
Has he left the Ca&s;tle &s;o &s;uddenly then, and
gone away without me?</P>
<P>The Enterprize upon which he is gone, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella,</HI> would not admit of a Lady's Com|pany:
And, &s;ince he has left &s;o con&s;iderable an
<PB N="180" REF="195">
Ho&s;tage with me as your&s;elf, I expect he will
not be long before he return; and, I hope, to
the Satisfaction of us both.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who could not penetrate into
the Meaning of her Cou&s;in's Words, began to
be &s;trangely alarmed: But, pre&s;ently, &s;uppo&s;ing
&s;he had a mind to divert her&s;elf with her Fears,
&s;he recovered her&s;elf, and told her &s;he would go
up to her Brother's Chamber, and look for him.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> did not offer to prevent her, being
very de&s;irous of knowing, whether he had not
left a Letter for her upon his Table, as was the
Cu&s;tom in tho&s;e Ca&s;es: And, while &s;he was
gone, Sir <HI>George</HI> &s;eized the Opportunity of &s;ay|ing
an hundred gallant Things to her, which
&s;he received with great Indifference; the mo&s;t
extravagant Compliments being what &s;he ex|pected
from all Men: And, provided they did
not directly pre&s;ume to tell her they loved her,
no Sort of Flattery or Adulation could di&s;plea&s;e
her.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> having
found her Brother in his Chamber, repeated to
him what Lady <HI>Bella</HI> had &s;aid, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed,
to fright her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> hearing this, and that Sir
<HI>George</HI> was with her, ha&s;tened to them as fa&s;t
as po&s;&s;ible, that he might interrupt the fooli&s;h
Stories he did not doubt &s;he was telling.</P>
<P>Upon Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Appearance with her
Brother, <HI>Arabella</HI> was a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P>I apprehended, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, that you were
&s;ome Miles from the Ca&s;tle by this time: But
your Delay and Indifference convince me, you
<PB N="181" REF="196">
neither expect nor wi&s;h to find the means of be|ing
ju&s;tified in my Opinion.</P>
<P>Pray, Cou&s;in, interrupted <HI>Glanville</HI> (&s;peaking
&s;oftly to her), let us leave this Di&s;pute to &s;ome
other time.</P>
<P>No, Sir, re&s;umed &s;he, aloud, my Honour is
concerned in your Ju&s;tification: Nor is it fit I
&s;hould &s;ubmit to have the Appearance of Amity
for a Per&s;on who has not yet &s;ufficiently cleared
him&s;elf of a Crime, with too much Rea&s;on laid
to his Charge. Did <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> think you, act
in this manner? Ah! if he had, doubtle&s;s,
<HI>Cleopatra</HI> would never have pardoned him: Nor
will I any longer &s;uffer you to give me repeated
Cau&s;es of Di&s;content.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> &s;eeing Confu&s;ion in Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
Countenance, and Rage in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, began to
think, that what he had at fir&s;t took for a Je&s;t,
was a &s;erious Quarrel between them, at which
it was not proper he &s;hould be pre&s;ent; and was
preparing to go: When <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;topping him
with a graceful Action&mdash;</P>
<P>If, noble Stranger, &s;aid &s;he, you are &s;o par|tial
to the Failings of a Friend, that you will
undertake to defend any unju&s;tifiable Action he
may be guilty of, you are at Liberty to depart:
But, if you will promi&s;e to be an unprejudiced
Hearer of the Di&s;pute between Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
and my&s;elf, you &s;hall know the Adventure
which has given Ri&s;e to it; and will be Judge
of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Commands I have
laid on him.</P>
<P>Though, Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>George</HI> (bowing
very low to her), Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> is my Friend,
yet there is no Likelihood I &s;hall e&s;pou&s;e his In|tere&s;t
<PB N="182" REF="197">
again&s;t yours: And a very &s;trong Prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
I feel in Favour of you, already per|&s;uades
me, that I &s;hall give Sentence on your
Side, &s;ince you have honoured me &s;o far, as to
con&s;titute me Judge of this Difference.</P>
<P>The &s;olemn Manner in which Sir <HI>George</HI>
(who began to &s;u&s;pect Lady <HI>Bella</HI>'s peculiar
Turn) &s;poke this, plea&s;ed her infinitely; while
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> vexed as he was, could hardly
forbear laughing: When <HI>Arabella,</HI> after a Look
of Approbation to Sir <HI>George,</HI> replied;</P>
<P>I find I have unwillingly engaged my&s;elf to
more than I fir&s;t intended: For, to enable you
to judge clearly of the Matter in Di&s;pute, 'tis
nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould know my whole Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> at this Word, not being able
to con&s;train him&s;elf, uttered a Groan, of the
&s;ame Nature with tho&s;e which are often heard in
the Pit at the Repre&s;entation of a new Play.
Sir <HI>George</HI> under&s;tood him perfectly well; yet
&s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed: And <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;tarting up,</P>
<P>Since, &s;aid &s;he, I have given you no new
Cau&s;e of Complaint, pray, from whence pro|ceeds
this Increa&s;e of Affliction?</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Cou&s;in, an&s;wered he, my Af|fliction,
if you plea&s;e to term it &s;o, increa&s;es
every Day; and I believe it will make me mad
at la&s;t: For this unaccountable Humour of
yours is not to be borne.</P>
<P>You do not &s;eem, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> to be far
from Madne&s;s already: And if your Friend
here, upon hearing the Pa&s;&s;ages between us,
&s;hould pronounce you guilty, I &s;hall be at a
Lo&s;s, whether I ought to treat you as a Mad|man,
or a Criminal. Sir, added &s;he, turning
<PB N="183" REF="198">
to Sir <HI>George,</HI> you will excu&s;e me, if, for cer|tain
Rea&s;ons, I can neither give you my Hi&s;tory
my&s;elf, nor be pre&s;ent at the Relation of it: One
of my Women, who is mo&s;t in my Confidence,
&s;hall acquaint you with all the Particulars of
my Life: After which I expect Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>
will abide by your Deci&s;ion, as, I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf,
I &s;hall be contented to do.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he went out of the Parlour, in
order to prepare <HI>Lucy</HI> for the Recital &s;he was to
make.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> re&s;olving not to be pre&s;ent at
this new Ab&s;urdity, ran out after her; and
went into the Garden, with a &s;trong Inclination
to hate the lovely Vi&s;ionary who gave him &s;uch
perpetual Unea&s;ine&s;s; leaving his Si&s;ter alone
with the Baronet, who diverted her&s;elf extreme|ly
with the Thoughts of hearing her Cou&s;in's
Hi&s;tory; a&s;&s;uring the Baronet, that he might ex|pect
&s;omething very curious in it, and find Mat|ter
&s;ufficient to laugh at; for &s;he was the mo&s;t
whim&s;ical Woman in the World.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who re&s;olved to profit by the
Knowlege of her Foible, made very little Re|ply
to Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Sneers; but waited pa|tiently
for the promi&s;ed Hi&s;tory, which was
much longer coming than he imagined.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Some curious In&s;tructions for relating an
Hi&s;tory.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ARABELLA,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he left them,
went up to her Apartment; and, calling
<HI>Lucy</HI> into her Clo&s;et, told her that &s;he had
made Choice of her, &s;ince &s;he was be&s;t ac|quainted
with her Thoughts, to relate her
Hi&s;tory to her Cou&s;ins, and a Per&s;on of Quality
who was with them.</P>
<P>Sure your Lady&s;hip je&s;ts with me, &s;aid <HI>Lucy:</HI>
How can I make a Hi&s;tory about your Lady|&s;hip?</P>
<P>There is no Occa&s;ion, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> for
you to make a Hi&s;tory: There are Accidents
enough in my Life to afford Matter for a long
one: All you have to do is to relate them as
exactly as po&s;&s;ible. You have lived with me
from my Childhood, and are in&s;tructed in all
my Adventures; &s;o that you mu&s;t be certainly
very capable of executing the Ta&s;k I have ho|noured
you with.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> I mu&s;t beg your Lady&s;hip
will excu&s;e me: I never could tell how to re|peat
a Story when I have read it; and I know
it is not &s;uch &s;imple Girls as I can tell Hi&s;tories:
It is only &s;it for Clerks, and &s;uch Sort of People,
that are very learned.</P>
<P>You are learned enough for that Purpo&s;e, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella;</HI> and, if you make &s;o much Difficulty
in performing this Part of your Duty, pray how
<PB N="185" REF="200">
came you to imagine you were fit for my Ser|vice,
and the Di&s;tinction I have favoured you
with? Did you ever hear of any Woman that
refu&s;ed to relate her Lady's Story, when de&s;ired?
Therefore, if you hope to po&s;&s;e&s;s my Favour
and Confidence any longer, acquit your&s;elf
hand&s;omely of this Ta&s;k, to which I have pre|ferred
you.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> terrified at the Di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he &s;aw in
her Lady's Countenance, begged her to tell
her what &s;he mu&s;t &s;ay.</P>
<P>Well! exclaimed <HI>Arabella:</HI> I am certainly
the mo&s;t unfortunate Woman in the World!
Every thing happens to me in a contrary manner
from any other Per&s;on! Here, in&s;tead of my
de&s;iring you to &s;often tho&s;e Parts of my Hi&s;tory
where you have greate&s;t room to flatter; and
to conceal, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome of tho&s;e Di&s;orders
my Beauty has occa&s;ioned; you a&s;k me to tell
you what you mu&s;t &s;ay; as if it was not nece&s;|&s;ary
you &s;hould know as well as my&s;elf, and be
able, not only to recount all my Words and
Actions, even the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t incon&s;ider|able,
but al&s;o all my Thoughts, however in|&s;tantaneous;
relate exactly every Change of my
Countenance; number all my Smiles, Half-&s;miles,
Blu&s;hes, Turnings pale, Glances, Pau&s;es,
Full-&s;tops, Interruptions; the Ri&s;e and Falling
of my Voice; every Motion of my Eyes; and
every Ge&s;ture which I have u&s;ed for the&s;e Ten
Years pa&s;t; nor omit the &s;malle&s;t Circum&s;tance
that relates to me.</P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me! Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> exce&s;|&s;ively
a&s;toni&s;hed, I never, till this Moment,
it &s;eems, knew the hundredth thou&s;andth Part
<PB N="186" REF="201">
of what was expected from me: I am &s;ure, if I
had, I would never have gone to Service; for I
might well know I was not fit for &s;uch Slavery.</P>
<P>There is no &s;uch great Slavery in doing all I
have mentioned to you, interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> It
requires, indeed, a good Memory, in which I
never thought you deficient; for you are
punctual to the greate&s;t Degree of Exactne&s;s in
recounting every thing one de&s;ires to hear from
you.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> whom this Prai&s;e &s;oothed into good
Humour, and flattered with a Belief, that &s;he
was able, with a little In&s;truction, to perform
what her Lady required, told her, if &s;he plea&s;ed
only to put her in a Way how to tell her
Hi&s;tory, &s;he would engage, after doing it once,
to tell it again whenever &s;he was de&s;ired.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> being obliged to comply with the
odd Reque&s;t, for which there was no Precedent
in all the Romances her Library was &s;tuffed
with, began to inform her in this manner:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, &s;aid &s;he, you mu&s;t relate my Birth,
which you know is very illu&s;trious; and, be|cau&s;e
I am willing to &s;pare you the Trouble of
repeating Things, that are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary,
you mu&s;t apologize to your Hearers for
&s;lipping over what pa&s;&s;ed in my Infancy, and the
fir&s;t Eight or Ten Years of my Life; not failing,
however, to remark, that, from &s;ome &s;prightly
Sallies of Imagination, at tho&s;e early Years,
tho&s;e about me conceived marvellous Hopes of
my future Under&s;tanding: From thence you
mu&s;t proceed to an accurate De&s;cription of my
Per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="202">
What! Madam, interrupted <HI>Lucy,</HI> mu&s;t I
tell what Sort of Per&s;on you have, to People
who have &s;een you but a Moment ago?</P>
<P>Que&s;tionle&s;s you mu&s;t, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> and
herein you follow the Examples of all the 'Squires
and Maids who relate their Ma&s;ters and Ladies
Hi&s;tories: For, though it be to a Brother, or
near Relation, who has &s;een them a thou&s;and
times, yet they never omit an exact Account of
their Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Very well, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Lucy:</HI> I &s;hall be
&s;ure not to forget that Part of my Story. I wi&s;h
I was as perfect in all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>Lucy,</HI> you mu&s;t repeat all the Con|ver&s;ations
I have ever held with you upon the
Subjects of Love and Gallantry, that your Au|dience
may be &s;o well acquainted with my
Humour, as to know exactly, before they are
told, how I &s;hall behave, in whatever Adven|tures
befal me.&mdash;After that, you may proceed
to tell them, how a noble Unknown &s;aw me at
Church; how prodigiou&s;ly he was &s;truck with
my Appearance; the tumultuous Thoughts
that this fir&s;t View of me occa&s;ioned in his
Mind.&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, interrupted <HI>Lucy</HI> again, I
can't pretend to tell his Thoughts: For how
&s;hould I know what they were? None but
him&s;elf can tell that.</P>
<P>However that may be, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> I ex|pect
you &s;hould decypher all his Thoughts, as
plainly as he him&s;elf could do; otherwi&s;e my
Hi&s;tory will be very imperfect: Well, I &s;uppo&s;e
you are at no lo&s;s about that whole Adventure,
in which you your&s;elf bore &s;o great a Share; &s;o
<PB N="188" REF="203">
need not give you any further In&s;tructions
concerning it: Only you mu&s;t be &s;ure, as I
&s;aid before, not to omit the lea&s;t Circum|&s;tance
in my Behaviour, but relate every
thing I did, &s;aid, and thought, upon that Oc|ca&s;ion.
The di&s;gui&s;ed Gardener mu&s;t appear
next in your Story: Here you will of nece&s;&s;ity
be a little deficient, &s;ince you are not able to
acquaint your Hearers with his true Name and
Quality; which, que&s;tionle&s;s, is very illu&s;trious.
However, above all, I mu&s;t charge you not to
mention that egregious Mi&s;take about the Carp;
for, you know how&mdash;</P>
<P>Here Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Entrance put a Stop to

<P>How! returned &s;he, is he gone? Truly I
am not much obliged to him for the Indif|ference
he has &s;hewed to hear my Story.</P>

neither of us expected you would be as good
as your Word, you were &s;o long in &s;ending your
Woman down: And my Brother per&s;uaded Sir
<HI>George</HI> you were only in Je&s;t; and Sir <HI>George</HI> has
carried him home to Dinner.</P>
<P>And is it at Sir <HI>George</HI>'s, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
that your Brother hopes to meet with an Occa|&s;ion
of clearing him&s;elf? He is either very in|&s;en&s;ible
of my Anger, or very con&s;cious of his
own Innocence.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> having nothing to &s;ay in
An&s;wer to an Accu&s;ation &s;he did not under|&s;tand,
changed the Di&s;cour&s;e: And the two
Ladies pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the Day together, with
tolerable Good-humour on Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Side;
<PB N="189" REF="204">
who was in great hopes of making a Conque&s;t
of the Baronet, before whom <HI>Arabella</HI> had
made her&s;elf ridiculous enough: But that Lady
was far from being at Ea&s;e; &s;he had laid her&s;elf
under a Nece&s;&s;ity of bani&s;hing Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> if
he did not give &s;ome convincing Proof of his
Innocence; which, as Matters &s;tood, &s;he
thought would be very hard for him to procure;
and, as &s;he could not ab&s;olutely believe him
guilty, &s;he was concerned &s;he had gone &s;o far.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A very Heroic Chapter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Glanville,</HI> coming home in the Even|ing,
a little elevated with the Wine,
of which he had drank too freely at Sir <HI>George</HI>'s,
being told the Ladies were together, entered the
Room where they were &s;itting; and, beholding
<HI>Arabella,</HI> who&s;e Pen&s;ivene&s;s had given an in|chanting
Softne&s;s to her Face, with a Look of
extreme Admiration&mdash;</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, Cou&s;in, &s;aid he, if you con|tinue
to treat me &s;o cruelly, you'll drive me
mad. How I could adore you this Moment,
added he, gazing pa&s;&s;ionately at her, if I might
but hope you did not hate me!</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who did not perceive the Condition
he was in, was better plea&s;ed with this Addre&s;s
than any he had ever u&s;ed; and, therefore, in&s;tead
<PB N="190" REF="205">
of chiding him, as &s;he was wont, for the Free|dom
of his Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;he ca&s;t her bright Eyes
upon the Ground, with &s;o charming a Confu&s;ion,
that <HI>Glanville,</HI> quite tran&s;ported, threw him&s;elf on
his Knees before her; and, taking her Hand,
attempted to pre&s;s it to his Lips: But &s;he,
ha&s;tily withdrawing it&mdash;</P>
<P>From whence is this new Boldne&s;s? &s;aid &s;he:
And what is it you would implore by that pro|&s;trate
Po&s;ture? I have told you already upon
what Conditions I will grant you my Pardon.
Clear your&s;elf of being an Accomplice with my
de&s;igned Ravi&s;her, and I am ready to re&s;tore
you to my E&s;teem.</P>
<P>Let me peri&s;h, Madam, returned <HI>Glanville,</HI>
if I would not die to plea&s;e you, this Moment!</P>
<P>It is not your Death that I require, &s;aid &s;he:
And, though you &s;hould never be able to ju&s;tify
your&s;elf in my Opinion, yet you might, haply,
expiate your Crime, by a le&s;s Puni&s;hment than
Death.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I do, then, my Angelic Cou&s;in?
re&s;umed he.</P>
<P>Truly, &s;aid &s;he, the Sen&s;e of your Offence
ought &s;o mortally to afflict you, that you &s;hould
invent &s;ome &s;trange kind of Penance for your|&s;elf,
&s;evere enough to prove your Penitence &s;in|cere.&mdash;You
know, I &s;uppo&s;e, what the unfor|tunate
<HI>Orontes</HI> did, when he found he had
wronged his adored <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> by an injurious
Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h he had hanged him&s;elf, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
ri&s;ing up in a Pa&s;&s;ion, at &s;eeing her again
in her Altitudes.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="206">
And why, pray, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> are you
&s;o &s;evere upon that poor Prince? who was,
haply, infinitely more innocent than your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Severe, Madam! &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> fearing he
had offended her: Why, to be &s;ure, he was a
&s;ad Scoundrel, to u&s;e his adored <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> as he
did: And I think one cannot be too &s;evere
upon him.</P>
<P>But, returned <HI>Arabella,</HI> Appearances were
again&s;t her; and he had &s;ome Shadow of Rea&s;on
for his Jealou&s;y and Rage: Then, you know,
amid&s;t all his Tran&s;ports, he could not be pre|vailed
upon to draw his Sword again&s;t her.</P>
<P>What did that &s;ignify? &s;aid <HI>Glanville:</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e
he &s;corned to draw his Sword upon a
Woman: That would have been a Shame in|deed.</P>
<P>That Woman, Sir, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> was
not &s;uch a contemptible Antagoni&s;t as you think
her: And Men, as valiant, po&s;&s;ibly, as <HI>Orontes</HI>
(though, que&s;tionle&s;s, he was one of the mo&s;t
valiant Men in the World), have been cut in
Pieces by the Sword of that brave <HI>Amazon.</HI></P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me! &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> I &s;hould
be afraid to look at &s;uch a terrible Woman: I
am &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t be a very ma&s;culine Sort of
Creature.</P>
<P>You are much mi&s;taken, Mi&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Arabella:</HI>
For <HI>Thale&s;tris,</HI> tho' the mo&s;t &s;tout and cou|rageous
of her Sex, was, neverthele&s;s, a per|fect
Beauty; and had as much Harmony and
Softne&s;s in her Looks and Per&s;on, as &s;he had
Courage in her Heart, and Strength in her Blows.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, re&s;umed Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> you
can never per&s;uade me, that a Woman who can
<PB N="192" REF="207">
&s;ight, and cut People to Pieces with her Blows,
can have any Softne&s;s in her Per&s;on: She mu&s;t
needs have very ma&s;culine Hands, that could
give &s;uch terrible Blows: And I can have no
Notion of the Harmony of a Per&s;on's Looks,
who, by what you &s;ay, mu&s;t have the Heart of
a Tyger. But, indeed, I don't think there ever
could be &s;uch a Woman.</P>
<P>What! Mi&s;s, interrupted <HI>Arabella:</HI> Do you
pretend to doubt, that there ever was &s;uch a
Per&s;on as <HI>Thale&s;tris,</HI> Queen of the <HI>Amazons?</HI>
Does not all the World know the Adventures
of that illu&s;trious Prince&s;s; her Affection for the
unju&s;t <HI>Orontes,</HI> who accu&s;ed her of having a
&s;candalous Intrigue with <HI>Alexander,</HI> whom &s;he
went to meet, with a very different De&s;ign, up|on
the Borders of her Kingdom? The injurious
Letter he wrote her, upon this Su&s;picion, made
her re&s;olve to &s;eek for him all over the World,
to give him that Death he had merited, by her
own Hand: And it was in tho&s;e Rencounters
that he had with her, while &s;he was thus in|cen&s;ed,
that he forbore to defend him&s;elf again&s;t
her, though her Sword was often pointed to his
Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>But, Madam, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
pray what became of this Queen of the <HI>Ama|zons?</HI>
Was &s;he not killed at the Siege of <HI>Troy?</HI></P>
<P>She never was at the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> returned
<HI>Arabella:</HI> But &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Princes who be|&s;ieged
<HI>Babylon,</HI> to recover the Liberty of <HI>Sta|tira</HI>
and <HI>Pari&s;atis:</HI> And it was in the oppo&s;ite
Party that &s;he met with her faithle&s;s Lover.</P>
<P>If he was faithle&s;s, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
he de&s;erved to die: And I wi&s;h, with all
<PB N="193" REF="208">
my Soul, &s;he had cut him in Pieces with that
famous Sword of hers that had done &s;uch Won|ders.</P>
<P>Yet this faithle&s;s Man, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI>
whom you &s;eem to have &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to, gave
&s;o glorious a Proof of his Repentance and Sor|row,
that the fair Queen re&s;tored him to her
Favour, and held him in much dearer Affection
than ever: For, after he was convinced of her
Innocence, he was re&s;olved to puni&s;h him&s;elf
with a Rigour equal to the Fault he had been
guilty of; and, retiring to the Woods, abandoned
for ever the Society of Men; dwelling in a
Cave, and living upon bitter Herbs, pa&s;&s;ing the
Days and Nights in continual Tears and Sor|row
for his Crime: And here he propo&s;ed to
end his Life, had not the fair <HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> found
him out in this Solitude; and, &s;truck with the
Sincerity of his Repentance, pardoned him;
and, as I have &s;aid before, re&s;tored him to her
Favour.</P>
<P>And, to &s;hew you, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> that I am
capable of doing as much for you; I will, if
you in&s;i&s;t upon it, &s;eek out for &s;ome Cave, and
do Penance in it, like that <HI>Orontes,</HI> provided
you will come and fetch me out of it, as that
&s;ame fair Queen did him.</P>
<P>I do not require &s;o much of you, &s;aid <HI>Ara|bella;</HI>
for I told you before, that, haply, you are
ju&s;tified already in my Opinion; but yet it is
nece&s;&s;ary, you &s;hould find out &s;ome Method of
convincing the World of your Innocence; other|wi&s;e
it is not fit I &s;hould live with you upon
Terms of Friend&s;hip and Civility.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="209">
Well, well, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> I'll
convince you of my Innocence, by bringing that
Ra&s;cal's Head to you, whom you &s;u&s;pect I
was inclined to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;tealing you away.</P>
<P>If you do that, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> doubtle&s;s
you will be iu&s;tified in my Opinion, and the
World's al&s;o; and I &s;hall have no Scruple to
treat you with as much Friend&s;hip as I did be|fore.</P>
<P>My Brother is much obliged to you, Ma|dam,
interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> for putting
him upon an Action, that would co&s;t him his
Life!</P>
<P>I have &s;o good an Opinion of your Brother's
Valour, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> that I am per&s;uaded he
will find no Difficulty in performing his Pro|mi&s;e;
and I make no que&s;tion but I &s;hall &s;ee him
covered with the Spoils of that Impo&s;tor, who
would have betrayed me; and I flatter my&s;elf,
he will be in a Condition to bring me his Head,
as he bravely promi&s;es, without endangering his
own Life.</P>
<P>Does your Lady&s;hip con&s;ider, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
that my Brother can take away no Per|&s;on's
Life whatever, without endangering his
own?</P>
<P>I con&s;ider, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> your Bro|ther
as a Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Virtue and Courage
enough to undertake to kill all my Enemies
and Per&s;ecutors, though I had ever &s;o many;
and I pre&s;ume, he would be able to perform
as many glorious Actions for my Service, as
either <HI>Juba, Cae&s;ario, Artamenes,</HI> or <HI>Artaban,</HI>
who, though not a Prince, was greater than any
of them.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="210">
If tho&s;e Per&s;ons you have named, &s;aid Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> were Murderers, and made a Practice
of killing People, I hope my Brother will be
too wi&s;e to follow their Examples: A &s;trange
kind of Virtue and Courage indeed, to take
away the Lives of one's Fellow-Creatures! How
did &s;uch Wretches e&s;cape the Gallows, I won|der?</P>
<P>I perceive, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> what kind
of Apprehen&s;ions you have: I &s;uppo&s;e you
think, if your Brother was to kill my Enemy,
the Law would puni&s;h him for it: But pray
undeceive your&s;elf, Mi&s;s: The Law has no
Power over Heroes; they may kill as many
Men as they plea&s;e, without being called to any
Account for it; and the more Lives they take
away, the greater is their Reputation for Virtue
and Glory. The illu&s;trious <HI>Artaban,</HI> from the
Condition of a private Man, rai&s;ed him&s;elf to
the &s;ublime&s;t Pitch of Glory by his Valour; for
he not only would win half a dozen Battles in
a Day; but, to &s;hew that Victory followed him
where-ever he went, he would change Parties,
and immediately the Vanqui&s;hed became Con|querors;
then, returning to the Side he had
quitted, changed the Laurels of his former
Friends into Chains. He made nothing of
tumbling Kings from their Thrones, and giving
away half a dozen Crowns in a Morning; for
his Genero&s;ity was equal to his Courage; and
to this Height of Power did he rai&s;e him&s;elf
by his Sword. Beginning at fir&s;t with petty
Conque&s;ts, and not di&s;daining to oppo&s;e his
glorious Arm to &s;ometimes le&s;s than a Score of
his Enemies; &s;o, by degrees, enuring him&s;elf
<PB N="196" REF="211">
to conquer incon&s;iderable Numbers, he came
at la&s;t to be the Terror of whole Armies, who
would fly at the Sight of his &s;ingle Sword.</P>
<P>This is all very a&s;toni&s;hing indeed, &s;aid Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville:</HI> However, I mu&s;t intreat you, not to
in&s;i&s;t upon my Brother's quarrelling and fight|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ng
with People, &s;ince it will be neither for
your Honour, nor his Safety; for I am afraid,
if he was to commit Murder to plea&s;e you, the
Laws would make him &s;uffer for it; and the
World would be very free with its Cen&s;ures on
your Lady&s;hip's Reputation, for putting him
upon &s;uch &s;hocking Crimes.</P>
<P>By your Di&s;cour&s;e, Mi&s;s, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
one would imagine, you knew as little in what
the good Reputation of a Lady con&s;i&s;ts, as the
Safety of a Man; for certainly the one depends
intirely upon his Sword, and the other
upon the Noi&s;e and Bu&s;tle &s;he makes in the
World. The Blood that is &s;hed for a Lady,
enhances the Value of her Charms; and the
more Men a Hero kills, the greater his Glory,
and, by Con&s;equence, the more &s;ecure he is.
If to be the Cau&s;e of a great many Deaths, can
make a Lady infamous; certainly none were
ever more &s;o, than <HI>Mandana, Cleopatra,</HI> and
<HI>Statira,</HI> the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Names in Anti|quity;
for each of whom, haply, an hundred
thou&s;and Men were killed: Yet none were ever
&s;o unju&s;t, as to profane the Virtue of tho&s;e Di|vine
Beauties, by ca&s;ting any Cen&s;ures upon
them for the&s;e glorious Effects of their Charms,
and the heroic Valour of their Admirers.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
I &s;hould not be &s;orry to have a Duel or Two
<PB N="197" REF="212">
fought for me in <HI>Hyde-park;</HI> but then I would
not have any Blood &s;hed for the World.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville</HI> here interrupting his Si&s;ter with a
Laugh, <HI>Arabella</HI> al&s;o could not forbear &s;miling
at the harmle&s;s Kind of Combats her Cou&s;in
was fond of.</P>
<P>But to put an End to the Conver&s;ation, and
the Di&s;pute which gave Ri&s;e to it, &s;he obliged
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to promi&s;e to fight with the Im|po&s;tor
<HI>Edward,</HI> whenever he found him; and
either take away his Life, or force him to con|fe&s;s,
he had no Part in the De&s;ign he had me|ditated
again&s;t her.</P>
<P>This being agreed upon, <HI>Arabella,</HI> conduct|ing
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> to her Chamber, retired to
her own; and pa&s;&s;ed the Night with much
greater Tranquillity, than &s;he had done the
preceding; being &s;atisfied with the Care &s;he
had taken of her own Glory, and per&s;uaded
that <HI>Glanville</HI> was not unfaithful; a Circum|&s;tance,
that was of more Con&s;equence to her
Happine&s;s, than &s;he was yet aware of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine is &s;u&s;pected of In&s;en|&s;ibility.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed at the
Ca&s;tle, Sir <HI>George</HI> was meditating on
the Means he &s;hould u&s;e to acquire the E&s;teem
of Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> of who&s;e Per&s;on he was a little
<PB N="198" REF="213">
enamoured, but of her Fortune a great deal
more.</P>
<P>By the Ob&s;ervations he had made on her Be|haviour,
he di&s;covered her peculiar Turn: He
was well read in Romances him&s;elf, and had
actually employed him&s;elf &s;ome Weeks in giv|ing
a new Ver&s;ion of the <HI>Grand Cyrus;</HI> but
the prodigious Length of the Ta&s;k he had under|taken,
terrified him &s;o much, that he gave it
over: Neverthele&s;s, he was perfectly well ac|quainted
with the chief Characters in mo&s;t of
the <HI>French</HI> Romances; could tell every thing
that was borrowed from them, in all the new
Novels that came out; and, being a very accu|rate
Critic, and a mortal Hater of <HI>Dryden,</HI> ri|diculed
him for want of Invention, as it appeared
by his having recour&s;e to the&s;e Books for the
mo&s;t &s;hining Characters and Incidents in his
Plays. <HI>Almanzor,</HI> he would &s;ay, was the Copy
of the famous <HI>Artaban</HI> in <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> who&s;e Ex|ploits
<HI>Arabella</HI> had expatiated upon to Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> and her Brother: His admired Cha|racter
of <HI>Melantha</HI> in Marriage <HI>&agrave;-la-mode,</HI> was
drawn from <HI>Beri&s;&s;a</HI> in the <HI>Grand Cyrus;</HI> and
the Story of <HI>O&s;myn</HI> and <HI>Ben&s;ayda,</HI> in his Con|que&s;t
of <HI>Granada,</HI> taken from <HI>Se&s;o&s;tris</HI> and <HI>Time|rilla</HI>
in that Romance.</P>
<P>Fraught therefore with the Knowlege of all
the Extravagances and Peculiarities in tho&s;e
Books, he re&s;olved to make his Addre&s;&s;es to
<HI>Arabella</HI> in the Form they pre&s;cribed; and,
not having Delicacy enough to be di&s;gu&s;ted with
the Ridicule in her Character, &s;erved him&s;elf
with her Foible, to effect his De&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="214">
It being nece&s;&s;ary, in order to his better Ac|quaintance
with <HI>Arabella,</HI> to be upon very
friendly Terms with Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> and her
Brother, he &s;aid a thou&s;and gallant Things to
one, and &s;eemed &s;o little offended with the
Gloom he ob&s;erved upon the Countenance of
the other, who po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured him, that
<HI>Arabella</HI> meant only to laugh at him, when &s;he
promi&s;ed him her Hi&s;tory, that he intreated
him, with the mo&s;t obliging Earne&s;tne&s;s, to fa|vour
him with his Company at his Hou&s;e, where
he omitted no &s;ort of Civility, to confirm their
Friend&s;hip and Intimacy; and per&s;uaded him,
by &s;everal little and &s;eemingly unguarded Ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
that he was not &s;o great an Admirer
of Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> as her agreeable Cou&s;in Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecured a Footing in the Ca&s;tle,
he furni&s;hed his Memory with all the nece&s;&s;ary
Rules of making Love in <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Ta&s;te, and
deferred his next Vi&s;it no longer than till the
following Day; but Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> being in|di&s;po&s;ed,
and not able to &s;ee Company, he knew
it would be in vain to expect to &s;ee <HI>Arabella,</HI>
&s;ince it was not to be imagined, Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville</HI>
could admit of a Vi&s;it, her Brother being
ill; and Lady <HI>Bella</HI> mu&s;t be al&s;o nece&s;&s;arily en|gaged
with her.</P>
<P>Contenting him&s;elf, therefore, with having
inquired after the Health of the Two Ladies,
he returned home, not a little vexed at his Di&s;|appointment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Indi&s;po&s;ition, increa&s;ing every
Day, grew at la&s;t dangerous enough to fill his
Si&s;ter with extreme Apprehen&s;ions. <HI>Arabella,</HI>

keeping up to her Forms, &s;ent regularly every
Day, to inquire after his Health; but did not
offer to go into his Chamber, though Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville</HI> was almo&s;t always there.</P>
<P>As &s;he conceived his Sickne&s;s to be occa&s;ioned
by the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion for her, &s;he ex|pected
&s;ome Overture &s;hould be made her by
his Si&s;ter, to engage her to make him a Vi&s;it;
&s;uch a Favour being never granted by any Lady
to a &s;ick Lover, till &s;he was previou&s;ly informed,
her Pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary to hinder the In|crea&s;e
of his Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> would not have failed to re|pre&s;ent
to her Cou&s;in the Incivility and Care|le&s;ne&s;s
of her Behaviour, in not deigning to
come and &s;ee her Brother in his Indi&s;po&s;ition,
had not Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> imputing this Neglect
to the Nicety of her Notions, which he had
upon other Occa&s;ions experienced, ab&s;olutely
forbid her to &s;ay any thing to her Cou&s;in upon
this Subject.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> being thus forced to Silence,
by the Fear of giving her Brother Unea&s;ine&s;s,
<HI>Arabella</HI> was extremely di&s;appointed to find,
that, in Five Days Illne&s;s, no Application had
been made to her, either by the &s;ick Lover, or
his Si&s;ter, who &s;he thought intere&s;ted her&s;elf
too little in his Recovery; &s;o that her Glory
obliging her to lay &s;ome Con&s;traint upon her|&s;elf,
&s;he behaved with a Coolne&s;s and In&s;en&s;i|bility,
that increa&s;ed Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Aver&s;ion
to her, while, in Reality, &s;he was extremely
concerned for her Cou&s;in's Illne&s;s; but not
&s;uppo&s;ing it dangerous, &s;ince they had not re|cour&s;e
to the u&s;ual Remedy, of be&s;eeching a
<PB N="201" REF="216">
Vi&s;it from the Per&s;on who&s;e Pre&s;ence was
alone able to work a Cure, &s;he re&s;olved to wait
patiently the Event.</P>
<P>However, &s;he never failed in her Re&s;pect to
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> whom &s;he vi&s;ited every Morn|ing,
before &s;he went to her Brother; and al&s;o
con&s;tantly dined with her in her own Apart|ment,
inquiring always, with great Sweetne&s;s,
concerning her Brother's Health; when per|ceiving
her in Tears one Day, as &s;he came in,
as u&s;ual, to dine with her, &s;he was extremely
alarmed; and a&s;ked with great Precipitation,
If Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was wor&s;e?</P>
<P>He is &s;o bad, Madam, returned Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
that I believe it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end
for my Papa, for fear he &s;hould die, and he
not &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Die, Mi&s;s! interrupted <HI>Arabella</HI> eagerly:
No, he mu&s;t not die; and &s;hall not, if the Pity
of <HI>Arabella</HI> is powerful enough to make him
live. Let us go then, Cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he, her
Eyes &s;treaming with Tears; let us go and vi&s;it
this dear Brother, whom you lament: Haply
my Sight may repair the Evils my Rigour
has cau&s;ed him; and &s;ince, as I imagine, he has
forborn, through the profound Re&s;pect he has
for me, to reque&s;t the Favour of a Vi&s;it, I
will voluntarily be&s;tow it on him, as well for
the Affection I bear you, as becau&s;e I do not
wi&s;h his Death.</P>
<P>You do not wi&s;h his Death, Madam! &s;aid
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively angry at a Speech,
in her Opinion, extremely in&s;olent: Is it &s;uch
a mighty Favour, pray, not to wi&s;h the Death
of my Brother, who never injured you? I am
<PB N="202" REF="217">
&s;ure, your Behaviour has been &s;o extremely in|human,
that I have repented a thou&s;and
times, we ever came to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Let us not wa&s;te the time in idle Reproaches,
&s;aid <HI>Arabella:</HI> If my Rigour has brought your
Brother into this Condition, my Compa&s;&s;ion
can draw him out of it: It is no more than
what all do &s;uffer, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a vio|lent
Pa&s;&s;ion; and few Lovers ever arrive to the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, without being &s;e|veral
times brought almo&s;t to their Graves,
either by their Severity, or &s;ome other Cau&s;e:
But nothing is more ea&s;y, than to work a Cure,
in the&s;e Ca&s;es; for the very Sight of the Per&s;on
beloved &s;ometimes does it, as it happened to
<HI>Artamenes,</HI> when the Divine <HI>Mandana</HI> con|de&s;cended
to vi&s;it him: A few kind Words,
&s;poken by the fair Prince&s;s of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Oroon|dates,</HI>
recalled him from the Gates of Death;
and one Line from <HI>Pari&s;atis</HI>'s Hand, which
brought a Command to <HI>Ly&s;imachus</HI> to live, made
him not only re&s;olve, but even able, to obey
her.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> quite out of Patience at this
tedious Harangue, without any Regard to Cere|mony,
flounced out of the Room; and ran to
her Brother's Chamber, followed by <HI>Arabella,</HI>
who imputed her rude Ha&s;te to a Su&s;picion,
that her Brother was wor&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>By which we hope the Reader will be dif|ferently
affected.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT their Entrance into the Room, Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville</HI> inquired of the Phy&s;ician, ju&s;t
going out, How he found her Brother? Who
replied, that his Fever was increa&s;ed &s;ince la&s;t
Night; and that it would not (&s;eeing <HI>Arabella</HI>
preparing to go to his Bed&s;ide) be proper to
di&s;turb him.</P>
<P>Saying this, he bow'd, and went out; and
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> repeating what the Phy&s;ician had
&s;aid, begged her to defer &s;peaking to him till
another time.</P>
<P>I know, &s;aid &s;he, that he apprehends, the
Sight of me will cau&s;e &s;o many tumultuous
Motions in the Soul of his Patient, as may prove
prejudicial to him: Neverthele&s;s, &s;ince his
Di&s;order is, que&s;tionle&s;s, more in his Mind than
Body, I may prove, haply, a better Phy&s;ician
than he; &s;ince I am more likely, than he, to
cure an Illne&s;s I have cau&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he walked up to Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
Bed&s;ide, who, &s;eeing her, thanked her, with a
weak Voice, for coming to &s;ee him; a&s;&s;uring
her, he was very &s;en&s;ible of the Favour &s;he did
him&mdash;</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not, &s;aid &s;he, blu&s;hing, thank me
too much, le&s;t I think the Favour I have done
you, is really of more Con&s;equence than I
imagined, &s;ince it merits &s;o many Acknowlege|ments:
<PB N="204" REF="219">
Your Phy&s;ician tells us, pur&s;ued &s;he,
that your Life is in Danger; but I per&s;uade
my&s;elf, you will value it &s;o much from this
Moment, that you will not protract your Cure
any longer.</P>
<P>Are you mad, Madam, whi&s;pered Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
who &s;tood behind her, to tell my Bro|ther,
that the Phy&s;ician &s;ays he is in Danger?
I &s;uppo&s;e you really wi&s;h he may die, or you
would not talk &s;o.</P>
<P>If, an&s;wered &s;he, whi&s;pering again to Mi&s;s
<HI>Glanville,</HI> you are not &s;atisfied with what I have
already done for your Brother, I will go as far
as Mode&s;ty will permit me: And gently pulling
open the Curtains;</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, with a Voice too much
rai&s;ed for a &s;ick Per&s;on's Ear, I grant to your
Si&s;ter's Solicitations, what the fair <HI>Statira</HI> did
to an Intere&s;t yet more powerful, &s;ince, as you
know, it was her own Brother, who pleaded
in Favour of the dying <HI>Orontes:</HI> Therefore,
con&s;idering you in a Condition haply no le&s;s
dangerous, than that of that pa&s;&s;ionate Prince,
I conde&s;cend, like her, to tell you, that I do not
wi&s;h your Death; that I intreat you to live;
and, la&s;tly, by all the Power I have over you,
I command you to recover.</P>
<P>Ending the&s;e Words, &s;he clo&s;ed the Curtain,
that her tran&s;ported Lover might not &s;ee her
Blu&s;hes and Confu&s;ion, which were &s;o great,
that, to conceal them, even from Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
&s;he hurried out of the Room, and retired
to her own Apartment, expecting, in a little
time, to receive a Billet, under the &s;ick Man's
Hand, importing, that, in Obedience to her
<PB N="205" REF="220">
Commands, he was recovered, and ready to
throw him&s;elf at her Feet, to thank her for that
Life &s;he had be&s;towed upon him, and to de|dicate
the Remains of it to her Service.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> who &s;tayed behind her, in a
&s;trange Surprize at her ridiculous Behaviour;
though &s;he longed to know what her Brother
thought of it, finding he continued &s;ilent,
would not di&s;turb him. The Shame he con|ceived
at hearing &s;o ab&s;urd a Speech from a
Woman he pa&s;&s;ionately loved; and the De&s;ire
he had, not to hear his Si&s;ter's Sentiments up|on
it; made him counterfeit Sleep, to avoid
any Di&s;cour&s;e with her upon &s;o di&s;agreeable a
Subject.</P>
<P>That Day his Fever increa&s;ed; and the next,
the Phy&s;ician pronouncing him in great Dan|ger,
a Me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched to Town, to
ha&s;ten the Coming of Sir <HI>Charles;</HI> and poor
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> was quite incon&s;oleable, under
the Apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing him.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> not to derogate from her Character,
affected great Firmne&s;s of Mind upon this Oc|ca&s;ion;
&s;he u&s;ed the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive Eloquence
to moderate her Cou&s;in's Affliction, and cau&s;ed
all imaginable Care to be taken of Mr. <HI>Glan|ville:</HI>
While any one was pre&s;ent, her Looks
di&s;covered only a calm and decent Sorrow;
yet when &s;he was alone, or had only her dear
<HI>Lucy</HI> with her, &s;he gave free Vent to her Tears;
and di&s;covered a Grief for Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Ill|ne&s;s,
little different from that &s;he had felt for her
Father's.</P>
<P>As &s;he now vi&s;ited him con&s;tantly every Day,
&s;he took an Opportunity, when &s;he was alone
<PB N="206" REF="221">
by his Bed&s;ide, to chide him for his Di&s;obedi|ence,
in not recovering, as &s;he had command|ed
him.</P>
<P>Dear Cou&s;in, an&s;wered he faintly, Can you
imagine, Health is not my Choice? And do
you think, I would &s;uffer the&s;e Pains, if I could
po&s;&s;ibly ea&s;e my&s;elf of them?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Pains, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> mi&s;taking his
Complaint, ought to have cea&s;ed, when the
Cau&s;e of them did; and when I was no longer
rigorous, you ought no longer to have &s;uffer|ed:
But tell me, &s;ince you are, que&s;tionle&s;s,
one of the &s;trange&s;t Men in the World, and
the harde&s;t to be comforted; nay, and I may
add, the mo&s;t di&s;obedient of all, that ever
wore the Fetters of Love; Tell me, I &s;ay,
what mu&s;t I do to content you?</P>
<P>If I live, Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Glanville</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;ince my Empire
over you is not &s;o ab&s;olute as I thought; and
&s;ince you think fit to re&s;erve to your&s;elf the
Liberty of dying, contrary to my De&s;ire; I
think I had better re&s;olve, not to make any
Treaty with you: However, as I have gone
thus far, I will do &s;omething more; and tell
you, &s;ince I have commanded you to live, I
will al&s;o permit you to love me, in order to
make the Life I have be&s;towed on you, worthy
your Acceptance. Make me no Reply, &s;aid
&s;he, putting her Hand on his Mouth; but be|gin
from this Moment to obey me.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he went out of the Room&mdash;</P>
<P>A few Hours after, his Fever being come to
a Height, he grew delirious, and talked very
wildly; but a favourable Cri&s;is en&s;uing, he fell
<PB N="207" REF="222">
into a &s;ound and quiet Sleep, and continued in
it for &s;everal Hours: Upon his waking, the
Phy&s;ician declared, his Fever was greatly aba|ted;
and the next Morning, pronounced him
out of Danger&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> tran&s;ported with Joy, ran to
Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> and informed her of this good News;
but as &s;he did not make her the Acknowledge|ments
&s;he expected, for being the Cau&s;e of his
Recovery, &s;he behaved with more Re&s;erve
than Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> thought was nece&s;&s;ary:
Which renewed her former Di&s;gu&s;ts; yet, dread|ing
to di&s;plea&s;e her Brother, &s;he concealed it
from the Ob&s;ervation of her Cou&s;in&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> being de&s;irous of completing her
Lover's Cure by &s;ome more favourable Ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
went to his Chamber, accompanied
by Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, approaching to his Bed&s;ide,
with an inchanting Smile, that you know how
to be obedient, when you plea&s;e; and I begin
to know, by the Price you &s;et upon your Obe|dience,
that &s;mall Favours will not content you.</P>
<P>Indeed, my deare&s;t Cou&s;in, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who had found her more intere&s;ted in his Re|covery
than he expected, you have been very
obliging, and I will always mo&s;t gratefully own
it.</P>
<P>I am glad, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> that Gra|titude
is not bani&s;hed from all your Family; and
that that Per&s;on in it, for whom I have the mo&s;t
Sen&s;ibility, is not intirely dive&s;ted of it&mdash;</P>
<P>I hope, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> my Si&s;ter has
given you no Cau&s;e to complain of her.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="223">
Indeed but &s;he has, replied <HI>Arabella;</HI> for,
notwith&s;tanding &s;he is obliged to me for the
Life of a Brother, whom que&s;tionle&s;s &s;he loves
very well; neverthele&s;s, &s;he did not deign to
make me the lea&s;t Acknowledgement for what I
have done in your Favour: However, <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
provided you continue to ob&s;erve that
Re&s;pect and Fidelity towards me, which I have
Rea&s;on to hope for from you; your Condition
&s;hall be never the wor&s;e for Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s un|acknowleging
Temper; and I now confirm
the Grant I Ye&s;terday made you, and repeat
it again; That I permit you to love me, and
promi&s;e you not to be di&s;plea&s;ed at any Te&s;ti|monies
you will give me of your Pa&s;&s;ion, pro|vided
you &s;erve me with an inviolable Fidelity.</P>
<P>But, Madam, returned Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> to
make my Happine&s;s complete, you mu&s;t al&s;o
promi&s;e to love me; or el&s;e what &s;ignifies the
Permi&s;&s;ion you give me to love you?</P>
<P>You are almo&s;t as unacknowleging as your
Si&s;ter, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> blu&s;hing; and if your
Health was perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, que&s;tionle&s;s,
I &s;hould chide you for your Pre&s;umption; but
&s;ince &s;omething mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ick Per|&s;ons,
who&s;e Rea&s;on, one may &s;uppo&s;e, is weak|ened
by their Indi&s;po&s;ition, I will pardon your
Indi&s;cretion at this time, and coun&s;el you to
wait patiently for what Heaven will determine
in your Favour: Therefore endeavour to merit
my Affection by your Re&s;pect, Fidelity, and
Services; and hope from my Ju&s;tice, what|ever
it ought to be&s;tow&mdash;</P>
<P>Ending this Speech, with a Solemnity of Ac|cent,
that gave Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> to under&s;tand,
<PB N="209" REF="224">
any Reply would offend her, he &s;ilently ki&s;&s;ed
her fair Hand, which &s;he held out to him; a
Favour, the Terms upon which they now were,
and his Sickne&s;s, gave him a Right to expect&mdash;
And, fini&s;hing her Vi&s;it for that time, left him
to his Repo&s;e; being extremely plea&s;ed at the
Pro&s;pect of his Recovery, and very well &s;atisfied
at having &s;o gracefully got over &s;o great a Diffi|culty,
as that of giving him Permi&s;&s;ion to love
her: For by the Laws of Romance, when a Lady
has once given her Lover that Permi&s;&s;ion, &s;he
may lawfully allow him to talk to her upon the
Subject of his Pa&s;&s;ion, accept all his Gallan|tries,
and claim an ab&s;olute Empire over all his
Actions; re&s;erving to her&s;elf the Right of fix|ing
the Time when &s;he may own her Affection:
And when that important Step is taken, and his
Con&s;tancy put to a few Years more Trial; when
he has killed all his Rivals, and re&s;cued her from
a thou&s;and Dangers; &s;he at la&s;t conde&s;cends to
reward him with her Hand; and all her Ad|ventures
are at an End for the future.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine di&s;covers her Know|lege
in A&s;tronomy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_SIR <HI>George,</HI> who had never mi&s;&s;ed
a Day, during Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
Illne&s;s, in &s;ending to the Ca&s;tle,
now he was able to &s;ee Company,
vi&s;ited him very frequently; and
&s;ometimes had the Happine&s;s to
meet with <HI>Arabella</HI> in his Chamber: But,
knowing the Conditions of her Father's Will,
and Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Preten&s;ions, he was obliged
to lay &s;o much Con&s;traint upon him&s;elf, in the
Pre&s;ence of Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> and her Brother, that
<PB N="212" REF="226">
he hardly dur&s;t tru&s;t his Eyes, to expre&s;s his Ad|miration
of her, for Fear of alarming them with
any Su&s;picion of his De&s;igns: However, he
did not fail to recommend him&s;elf to her
E&s;teem, by a Behaviour to her full of the mo&s;t
perfect Re&s;pect; and very often, ere he was
aware, uttered &s;ome of the extravagant Com|pliments,
that the Gallants in the <HI>French</HI> Ro|mances
u&s;e to their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>If he walked with her in the Gardens, he
would ob&s;erve, that the Flowers, which were
before langui&s;hing and pale, bloomed with fre&s;h
Beauty at her Approach; that the Sun &s;hined
out with double Brightne&s;s, to exceed, if po&s;&s;ible,
the Lu&s;tre of her Eyes; and that the Wind,
fond of ki&s;&s;ing her cele&s;tial Countenance, played
with her fair Hair; and, by gentle Murmurs,
declared its Happine&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>If Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> happened to be pre&s;ent,
when he talked to her in this Strain, &s;he would
&s;uppo&s;e he was ridiculing her Cou&s;in's fan|ta&s;tical
Turn; and when &s;he had an Opportu|nity
of &s;peaking to him alone, would chide him,
with a great deal of good Humour, for giving
hrr &s;o much Diver&s;ion at her Cou&s;in's Ex|pence.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> improving this Hint, per&s;uaded
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> by his An&s;wers, that he really
laughed at <HI>Arabella;</HI> and, being now le&s;s fear|ful
of giving any Su&s;picion to the gay Coquet,
&s;ince &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to deceive her, he applied
him&s;elf, with more A&s;&s;iduity than ever, to in&s;i|nuate
him&s;elf into <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Flavour.</P>
<P>However, the Nece&s;&s;ity he was under of be|ing
always of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Opinion, &s;ometimes
<PB N="213" REF="227">
drew him into little Difficulties with Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville.</HI>
Knowing that young Lady was extremely
fond of Scandal, he told her, as a mo&s;t agree|able
Piece of News, one Afternoon when he
was there, that he had &s;een Mi&s;s <HI>Groves,</HI> who,
he &s;uppo&s;ed, had come into the Country upon
the &s;ame Account as &s;he had done a Twelve|month
before: Her Marriage being yet a
Secret, the complai&s;ant Baronet threw out an
Hint or two, concerning the Familiarity and
Corre&s;pondence there was between her and the
Gentleman to whom &s;he was really &s;ecretly
married.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> making the mo&s;t of this Intel|ligence,
&s;aid a thou&s;and &s;evere Things again&s;t
the unfortunate Mi&s;s <HI>Groves;</HI> which <HI>Arabella,</HI>
always benevolent and kind, could not bear.</P>
<P>I per&s;uade my&s;elf, &s;aid &s;he to her Cou&s;in,
that you have been mi&s;informed concerning this
Beauty, who&s;e Misfortunes you aggravate by
your cruel Cen&s;ures; and whoever has given
you the Hi&s;tory of her Life, has, haply, done it
with great Inju&s;tice&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, Madam, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI>
do you think you are better acquainted with her
Hi&s;tory, as you call it, who have never been in
Town, where her Follies made her &s;o remark|able,
than Per&s;ons who were Eye-witne&s;&s;es of
all her ridiculous Actions?</P>
<P>I apprehend, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> that I, who have
had a Relation made to me of all the Pa&s;&s;ages
of her Life, and have been told all her mo&s;t
&s;ecret Thoughts, may know as much, if not
more, than Per&s;ons who have lived in the &s;ame
Place with her, and have not had that Advan|tage;
<PB N="214" REF="228">
and I think, I know enough to vindi|cate
her from many cruel A&s;per&s;ions.</P>
<P>Pray, Madam, returned Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> will
your Lady&s;hip pretend to defend her &s;candalous
Commerce with Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;?</P>
<P>I know not, Mi&s;s, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> why you
call her Intercour&s;e with that perjured Man by
&s;o unju&s;t an Epithet. If Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> be uncha&s;te,
&s;o was the renowned <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> who&s;e Marriage
with <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> is controverted to this Day.</P>
<P>And what Rea&s;ons, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
have you for &s;uppo&s;ing, Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> was
married to Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;, &s;ince all the World
knows to the contrary?</P>
<P>Very &s;ufficient ones, &s;aid <HI>Arabella;</HI> &s;ince it is
hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, a young Lady of Mi&s;s
<HI>Groves</HI>'s Quality would &s;tain the Lu&s;tre of her
De&s;cent by &s;o &s;hameful an Intrigue; and al&s;o,
&s;ince there are Examples enough to be found of
Per&s;ons, who &s;uffered under the &s;ame unhappy
Circum&s;tances as her&s;elf; yet were perfectly
innocent, as was that great Queen I have men|tioned;
who que&s;tionle&s;s, you, Sir, are &s;uffi|ciently
convinced, was married to that illu&s;trious
Conqueror; who, by betraying &s;o great and &s;o
fair a Queen, in great mea&s;ure tarni&s;hed the
Glory of his Laurels&mdash;</P>
<P>Married, Madam! replied Sir <HI>George:</HI> Who
pre&s;umes to &s;ay, that fair Queen was not mar|ried
to that illu&s;trious Conqueror?</P>
<P>Nay, you know, Sir, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI>
many People did &s;ay, even while &s;he was living,
that &s;he was not married; and have branded her
Memory with infamous Calumnies, upon Ac|count
of the Son &s;he had by <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> the brave
<PB N="215" REF="229">
<HI>Cae&s;ario,</HI> who, under the Name of <HI>Cleomedon,</HI>
performed &s;uch Miracles of Valour in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI> I was
always a great Admirer of the famous <HI>Cleome|don,</HI>
who was certainly the greate&s;t Hero in the
World.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella; Cleomedon</HI>

and all the Heroes that ever were, mu&s;t give
place to the unequalled Prince of <HI>Mauritania;</HI>
that illu&s;trious, and for a long time unfortunate,
Lover of the Divine <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> who was Daugh|ter,
as you que&s;tionle&s;s know, of the great
Queen we have been &s;peaking of&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear Heart! &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> What is
all this to the Purpo&s;e? I would fain know,

ever married to Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, I do, &s;aid he; for, as Lady <HI>Bella</HI>
&s;ays, &s;he is in the &s;ame unhappy Circum&s;tance
with the great <HI>Cleopatra;</HI> and if <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>
could be guilty of denying his Marriage with
that Queen, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, why
Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;might not be guilty of the &s;ame

<P>So then, interrupted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> blu&s;hing
with Spite, you will really offer to maintain,
that Mi&s;s <HI>Groves</HI> was married? Ridiculous!
How &s;uch a Report would be laughed at in <HI>Lon|don!</HI></P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> if ever I go to
<HI>London,</HI> I &s;hall not &s;cruple to maintain that
Opinion to every one, who will mention that
Fair-one to me; and u&s;e all my Endeavours to

Your Lady&s;hip would do well, &s;aid Mi&s;s

<P>Since you are &s;o courageous, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
laughing exce&s;&s;ively at this Sally, which,

make the World believe, that her Corre&s;pond|ence

<P>Indeed, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;mile|ing,

<HI>Arabella,</HI> unwilling to expo&s;e her Cou&s;in's Ig|norance,

&s;he, that having always had &s;ome Inclination to

her Brother's Dominions, and fled away
with a Lover whom &s;he did not hate; que&s;tion|le&s;s,
her Enemies accu&s;e her, with &s;ome Ap|pearance

<P>But, Madam, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> her Ene|mies
will not take the Pains to examine her
Rea&s;ons for this Conduct&mdash;</P>
<P>True, Sir, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella;</HI> for &s;he was in

<P>Tho', replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> I am extremely
angry with the indi&s;creet <HI>Cepio,</HI> who di&s;covered
<HI>Alexander</HI> to the <HI>Armenian</HI> King; yet what does
your Lady&s;hip think of that gallant Action of
his, when he &s;aw him upon the Scaffold, and
the Executioner ready to cut off his Head? How
brave it was of him, to pa&s;s undauntedly thro'
the prodigious Number of Guards that environ|ed
the Scaffold; and, with his drawn Sword, run
the Executioner through-the Body, in the Sight
of them all! Then giving the Prince another

<P>Que&s;tionle&s;s, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> it was a glo|rious

the Con&s;ternation he was in: Yet that was no|thing
to the horrible De&s;pair, which tormented
him afterwards, when he found, that <HI>Alexander,</HI>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which a very plea&s;ing Conver&s;ation is
left unfini&s;hed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS <HI>Arabella</HI> was in this Part of her Di&s;|cour&s;e,
a Servant came to inform her, that
Sir <HI>Charles Glanville</HI> was ju&s;t alighted. Upon
which, Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> flew to receive her Father;
and <HI>Arabella,</HI> walking a little &s;lower after her,
gave Sir <HI>George</HI> an Opportunity of holding a little
longer Conver&s;ation with her.</P>
<P>I dare believe, Madam, &s;aid he, when you
read the Story of the unfortunate <HI>Alexander,</HI>
your fair Eyes did not refu&s;e to &s;hed &s;ome
Tears at the barbarous and &s;hameful Death
he was going to &s;uffer: Yet I a&s;&s;ure you&punc; me+lancholy as his Situation was, it was al&s;o very
<PB N="220" REF="234">
glorious for him, &s;ince he had the &s;ublime
Satisfaction of dying for the Per&s;on he adored;
and had the ravi&s;hing Plea&s;ure to know, that his
Fate would draw Tears from that lovely Prin|ce&s;s,
for whom he &s;acrificed his Life: Such a
Condition, Madam, ought to be envied rather
than pitied; for, next to the Happine&s;s of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
the Per&s;on one adores, certainly the
Glory of dying for her is mo&s;t to be coveted.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> plea&s;ingly &s;urpri&s;ed to hear Lan|guage
&s;o conformable to her own Ideas, looked
for a Moment upon the Baronet, with a mo&s;t
inchanting Complai&s;ancy in her Eyes&mdash;</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, that you
&s;peak very rationally upon the&s;e Matters; and
by the Tenderne&s;s and Genero&s;ity of your Sen|timents,
you give me Cau&s;e to believe, that
your Heart is prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;ome&punc; Object
worthy of in&s;piring them.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> &s;eeming, as if he &s;truggled to &s;up|pre&s;s
a Sigh; You are in the right, Madam,
&s;aid he, to &s;uppo&s;e, that if my Heart be
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with any Object, it is with one,
who is capable of in&s;piring a very &s;ublime Pa&s;|&s;ion;
and I a&s;&s;ure you, if ever it &s;ubmits to any
Fetters, they &s;hall be impo&s;ed on me by the
faire&s;t Per&s;on in the World&mdash;</P>
<P>Since Love is not voluntary, replied <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
&s;miling, it may happen, that your Heart
may be &s;urpri&s;ed by a meaner Beauty, than
&s;uch a one as you de&s;cribe: However, as a
Lover has always an extraordinary Partiality
for the beloved Object, 'tis probable, what
you &s;ay may come to pa&s;s; and you may be
<PB N="221" REF="235">
in Love with the faire&s;t Per&s;on in the World,
in your own Opinion.</P>
<P>They were now &s;o near the Hou&s;e, that Sir
<HI>George</HI> could reply no other ways, than by a very
pa&s;&s;ionate Glance, which <HI>Arabella</HI> did not ob|&s;erve,
being in ha&s;te to pay her Re&s;pects to her
Uncle, whom &s;he met ju&s;t going to Mr. <HI>Glan|ville.</HI>
Her Looks were directed to him. Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> &s;aluting her with great Affection, they
all went into Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Chamber, who
received his Father with the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect and
Tenderne&s;s; extremely regretting the Trouble
he had been at in taking a Journey to the
Ca&s;tle upon his Account; and gently blaming
his Si&s;ter for her Precipitancy in alarming him
&s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> extremely overjoyed to find him
&s;o well recovered, would not allow him to
blame Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> for what &s;he had done:
but, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his Niece, he thanked
her for the Care &s;he had taken of Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
in very obliging Terms.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> could not help blu&s;hing at her
Uncle's Compliment, &s;uppo&s;ing he thanked her
for having re&s;tored her Cou&s;in to his Health.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> is
le&s;s obliged to my Commands, than to the
Goodne&s;s of his Con&s;titution, for his Recovery;
and herein he was not &s;o obedient, as many
Per&s;ons I could name to him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> willing to prevent the Com|pany's
Ob&s;ervation upon this Speech, began to
acquaint his Father with the Ri&s;e and Pro|gre&s;s
of his Di&s;temper: But though the old
Gentleman li&s;tened with great Attention to his
<PB N="222" REF="236">
Son, while he was &s;peaking; yet not having lo&s;t
a Word of what <HI>Arabella</HI> had &s;aid, as &s;oon as he
was done, he turned to his Niece, and a&s;ked
her, how &s;he could be &s;o unju&s;t, to accu&s;e his
Son of Di&s;obedience, becau&s;e he did not reco|ver,
when &s;he commanded him? Why, Ma|dam,
added he, you want to carry your Power
farther then ever any Beauty did before you;
&s;ince you pretend to make People &s;ick and well,
whenever you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Really, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> I pretend to
no more Power, than what I pre&s;ume all others
of my Sex have upon the like Occa&s;ions; and
&s;ince nothing is more common, than for a
Gentleman, though ever &s;o &s;ick, to recover in
Obedience to the Commands of that Per&s;on,
who has an ab&s;olute Power over his Life, I
conceive, I have a Right to think my&s;elf in|jured,
if Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> contrary to mine, had
thought proper to die&mdash;</P>
<P>Since, &s;aid the old Gentlemen, &s;miling, my
Son has &s;o well obeyed your Commands in re|covering
his Health, I &s;hall tremble, le&s;t, in
Obedience to a contrary Command of yours, he
&s;hould die, and deprive me of an Heir; a Mi&s;|fortune,
which, if it &s;hould happen, I &s;hould
place to your Account.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> very gravely,
I have too great an E&s;teem for Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
to condemn him to &s;o &s;evere a Puni&s;hment as
Death for light Offences: And &s;ince it is not
very probable, that he will ever commit &s;uch
Crimes again&s;t me, as can be only expiated by
his Death; &s;uch as Infidelity, Di&s;obedience,
<PB N="223" REF="237">
and the like; you have no Rea&s;on to fear &s;uch
a Misfortune by my means&mdash;</P>
<P>Alas! replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> you Beauties make
very nice Di&s;tinctions in the&s;e Ca&s;es; and
think, if you do not directly command your
Lovers to die, you are no-ways accountable for
their Death: And when a Lover, as it often
happens, dies through De&s;pair of ever being able
to make him&s;elf beloved; or, being doomed to
Bani&s;hment or Silence, falls into a Fever, from
which nothing but Kindne&s;s can recover him&punc;
and, that being denied, he patiently expires; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
&s;ay, when the&s;e Things happen, as they cer|tainly
do every Day; How can you hold your &s;elves
guiltle&s;s of their Deaths, which are ap|parently
occa&s;ioned, either by your Scorn or
In&s;en&s;ibility?</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> were ex+tremely
diverted at this Speech of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s;
and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> though he would have wi&s;h|ed
he had been raillying any other Per&s;on's Follies
than his Cou&s;in's, yet could not help &s;miling at
the &s;olemn Accent, in which he delivered him|&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> mightily plea&s;ed with his Manner of
talking, was re&s;olved to furni&s;h him with more
Occa&s;ions of diverting the Company at her Ex|pence.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, an&s;wered &s;he, you are one of tho&s;e
Per&s;ons, who call a ju&s;t Decorum, which all
Ladies, who love Glory as they ought to do,
are obliged to pre&s;erve, by the Name of Seve|rity:
But pray, what would you have a Lady
do, whom an importunate Lover pre&s;umes to
declare his Pa&s;&s;ion to? You know it is not per|mitted
<PB N="224" REF="238">
us to li&s;ten to &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es; and
you know al&s;o, whoever is guilty of &s;uch an
Offence, merits a mo&s;t rigorous Puni&s;hment:
Moreover, you find, that when a Sentence of
Bani&s;hment or Silence is pronounced upon them,
the&s;e unhappy Criminals are &s;o con&s;cious of the
of Ju&s;tice their Doom, that they never murmur
again&s;t their Judge who condemns them; and
therefore, whatever are their Fates, in Con&s;e|quence
of that Anger they have incurred, the
Ladies, thus offended, ought not to be charged
with it, as any cruel Exertion of their Power.</P>
<P>Such Eloquence as yours, Madam, replied
Sir <HI>George,</HI> might defend Things yet more un|ju&s;tifiable:
However, you mu&s;t give me Leave,
as being intere&s;ted in the Safety of my Sex,
&s;till to be of Opinion, that no Man ought to
be hated, becau&s;e he adores a beautiful Object,
and con&s;ecrates all his Moments to her Ser|vice.</P>
<P>Que&s;tionle&s;s, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> he will not
be hated, while, out of the Re&s;pect and Reverence
he bears her, he carefully conceals his Pa&s;&s;ion
from her Knowlege; but as &s;oon as ever he
breaks through the Bounds, which that Re|&s;pect
pre&s;cribes him, and lets her under&s;tand
his true Sentiments, he has Rea&s;on to expect
a mo&s;t rigorous Sentence, &s;ince he certainly, by
that Pre&s;umption, has greatly de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>If the Ladies, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> were more
equitable, and would make &s;ome Di&s;tinction
between tho&s;e who really love them in a pa&s;|&s;ionate
and re&s;pectful Silence, and others who
do not feel the Power of their Charms, they
might &s;pare them&s;elves the Trouble of hearing
<PB N="225" REF="239">
what &s;o mortally offends them: But when a
Lady &s;ees a Man every Day, who by his Looks,
Sighs, and Solicitude to plea&s;e her, by his num|berle&s;s
Services and con&s;tant Attendance of her,
makes it evident, that his Soul is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with
a violent Pa&s;&s;ion for her; I &s;ay, when a Lady
&s;ees, and yet will not &s;ee, all this, and per&s;i&s;ts
in u&s;ing a pa&s;&s;ionate Adorer with all the Indif|ference
due to a Man wholly in&s;en&s;ible of the
Power of her Charms; what mu&s;t he do in
&s;uch a mortifying Situation, but make known
his Torments to her that occa&s;ions them, in
order to prevail upon her to have &s;ome Sen&s;e
of what he does and feels hourly for her &s;ake?</P>
<P>But &s;ince he gains nothing by the Di&s;covery
of his Pa&s;&s;ion, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella;</HI> but, on the
contrary, lo&s;es the Advantages he was before
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, which were very great, &s;ince he
might &s;ee and di&s;cour&s;e with his Mi&s;tre&s;s every
Day; and, haply, have the Honour to do her a great
many petty Services, and receive &s;ome of her
Commands; all the&s;e Advantages he lo&s;es, when
he declares he loves: And truly, I think, a Man
who is &s;o unwi&s;e as to hazard a certain Happine&s;s
for a very improbable Hope, de&s;erves to be
puni&s;hed, as well for his Folly as Pre&s;umption;
and, upon both the&s;e Accounts, Bani&s;hment is
not too rigorous a Sentence.</P>

<P>Definition of Love and Beauty.&mdash;The

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOUGH, replied Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> you
are very &s;evere in the Treatment you think
it nece&s;&s;ary our Sex &s;hould receive from yours;
yet I wi&s;h &s;ome of our Town Beauties were,
if not altogether of your Opinion, yet &s;uffi|ciently
&s;o, as to make it not a Slavery for a
Man to be in their Company; for unle&s;s one
talks of Love to the&s;e fair Conquets the whole
time one is with them, they are quite di&s;|plea&s;ed,
and look upon a Man who can think
any thing, but them&s;elves, worthy his Thoughts
or Ob&s;ervation, with the utmo&s;t Contempt.
How often have you and I, Sir <HI>George,</HI> pur&s;ued
he, pitied the Condition of the few Men of
Sen&s;e, who are &s;ometimes among the Croud of
Beaux, who attend the Two Si&s;ter Beauties
to all Places of polite Diver&s;ion in Town? For
tho&s;e Ladies think it a mortal Injury done to
their Charms, if the Men about them have
Eyes or Ears for any Object but their Faces,
or any Sound but that of their Voices: So that
the Connoi&s;&s;eurs in Mu&s;ic, who attend them to
<HI>Ranelagh,</HI> mu&s;t &s;top their Ears, like <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI>
when the <HI>Siren Fra&s;i</HI> &s;ings; and the Wits, who
gallant them to the Side box, mu&s;t lay a much
greater Con&s;traint upon them&s;elves, in order to
<PB N="227" REF="241">
re&s;i&s;t the Soul-moving <HI>Garrick;</HI> and appear in|&s;en&s;ible,
while he is upon the Stage.</P>
<P>Upon my Soul, added Sir <HI>George</HI> (forgetting
the Character he a&s;&s;umed) when I have &s;een
&s;ome Per&s;ons of my Acquaintance talking to
the elde&s;t of the&s;e Ladies, while one of <HI>Con|greve</HI>'s
Comedies has been acting; his Face
quite turned from the Stage, and hers over|&s;pread
with an eternal Smile; her fine Eyes
&s;ometimes lifted up in a beautiful Surprize, and
a little inchanting Giggle half-hid with her Fan&punc;
in &s;pite of their Inattention, I have been ready
to imagine, he was entertaining her with Re|marks
upon the Play, which &s;he was judi|cious
enough to under&s;tand; and yet I have
afterwards been informed by him&s;elf, that
nothing was le&s;s in their Thoughts; and
all that Variety in her Face, and that extreme
&s;eeming Earne&s;tne&s;s in his Di&s;cour&s;e, was oc|ca&s;ioned
by the mo&s;t trifling Subjects imagin|able:
He perhaps had been telling her, how
the Sight of her Squirrel, which peeped out of
her Pocket, &s;urpri&s;ed &s;ome Ladies &s;he was
vi&s;iting; and what they &s;aid upon her Pondne&s;s
for it, when &s;he was gone; blaming them at the
&s;ame time for their want of Delicacy, in not
knowing how to &s;et a right Value upon &s;uch
plea&s;ing Animals: Hence proceeded her Smiles,
the lifting up of her Eyes, the half-&s;tifled
Laugh, and all the pretty Ge&s;tures that appeared
&s;o wonderfully charming to all tho&s;e who did
not hear their Di&s;cour&s;e: And it is upon &s;uch
Trifies as the&s;e, or el&s;e on the inexhau&s;tible
Subject of their Charms, that all who are am|bitious
<PB N="228" REF="242">
of being near the&s;e Miracles, are under
a Nece&s;&s;ity of talking.</P>
<P>And pray, interrupted <HI>Arabella,</HI> What Sub|jects
afford Matter for a more plea&s;ing Variety
of Conver&s;ation, than tho&s;e of Beauty and
Love? Can we &s;peak of any Object &s;o capable
of delighting as Beauty, or of any Pa&s;&s;ion of the
Mind more &s;ublime and plea&s;ing than Love?</P>
<P>With Submi&s;&s;ion, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Glanville,</HI> I
conceive, all that can be &s;aid, either of Beauty,
or of Love, may be compri&s;ed in a very few
Words: All who have Eyes, and behold true
Beauty, will be ready to confe&s;s it is a very
plea&s;ing Object; and all that can be &s;aid of it,
may be &s;aid in very few Words; for when we
have run over the Catalogue of Charms, and
mentioned fine Eyes, fine Hair, delicate Com|plexion,
regular Features, and an elegant Shape,
we can only add a few Epithets more, &s;uch as
Lovely, Dangerous, Inchanting, Inre&s;i&s;tible,
and the like; and every thing that can be &s;aid
of Beauty is exhau&s;ted. And &s;o likewi&s;e it is
with Love; we know that Admiration pre|cedes
it, that Beauty kindles it, Hope keeps it
alive, and De&s;pair puts an End to it; and that
Subject may be as &s;oon di&s;cu&s;&s;ed as the other,
by the judicious U&s;e of proper Words; &s;uch as
Wounds, Darts, Fires, Langui&s;hings, Dyings,
Torture, Rack, Jealou&s;y, and a few more of
no Signification, but upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s Subject.</P>
<P>Certainly, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> you have not
well con&s;idered what you &s;ay, &s;ince you main|tain,
that Love and Beauty are Subjects ea&s;ily
and quickly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: Take the Pains, I be&s;eech
you, to reflect a little upon tho&s;e numerous and
<PB N="229" REF="243">
long Conver&s;ations, which the&s;e Subjects have
given Ri&s;e to in <HI>Clelia,</HI> and the <HI>Grand Cyrus,</HI>
where the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and greate&s;t Per&s;onages
in the World manage the Di&s;putes; and the
agreeable Diver&s;ity of their Sentiments on tho&s;e
Heads affords a mo&s;t plea&s;ing and rational En|tertainment:
You will there find, that the
greate&s;t Conquerors, and Heroes of invincible
Valour, rea&s;on with the mo&s;t exact and &s;cru|pulous
Nicety upon Love and Beauty; the Su|periority
of fair and brown Hair controverted
by Warriors, with as much Eagerne&s;s as they
di&s;pute for Victory in the Field; and the dif|ferent
Effects of that Pa&s;&s;ion upon different
Hearts defined with the utmo&s;t Accuracy and
Eloquence.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I
&s;hould have but a mean Opinion of tho&s;e
Warriors, as you call them, who could bu&s;y
them&s;elves in talking of &s;uch Trifles; and be
apt to imagine &s;uch in&s;ignificant Fellows, who
could wrangle about the Colour of their Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es
Hair, would be the fir&s;t to turn their
Backs upon the Enemy in Battle.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, Sir, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> glow|ing
with Indignation, that you can entertain
&s;uch unworthy Thoughts of Heroes, who merit
the Admiration and Prai&s;e of all Ages for
their ine&s;timable Valour, whom the Spears of
a whole Army oppo&s;ed to each of their &s;ingle
Swords would not oblige to fly? What think
you, Sir, pur&s;ued &s;he, looking at Sir <HI>George,</HI> of
the injurious Words my Uncle has uttered
again&s;t tho&s;e heroic Princes, who&s;e Courage, I
believe, you are as well acquainted with as my|&s;elf?
<PB N="230" REF="244">
The great <HI>Oroondates,</HI> the invincible <HI>Ar|taban,</HI>
the valiant and fortunate <HI>Artamenes,</HI> the
irre&s;i&s;tible <HI>Juba,</HI> the incomparable <HI>Cleomedon,</HI>
and an hundred other Heroes I could name, are
all injured by this unju&s;t A&s;&s;ertion of my Uncle;
&s;ince certainly they were not more famous for
their noble and wonderful Actions in War, than
for the Sublimity and Con&s;tancy of their Af|fections
in Love.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Heroes you have named, re|plied
Sir <HI>George,</HI> had the Misfortune, even in
their Lives, to be very cruelly vilified: The
great <HI>Oroondates</HI> was a long time accu&s;ed of
Treachery to his Divine Prince&s;s; the valiant
and unfortunate <HI>Artamenes</HI> was &s;u&s;pected of
Incon&s;tancy; and the irre&s;i&s;tible <HI>Juba</HI> re|proached
with Infidelity and Ba&s;ene&s;s, by both
his Mi&s;tre&s;s and Friend.</P>
<P>I never knew you was &s;o well acquainted
with the&s;e Per&s;ons, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glanville;</HI>
and I fan&s;y it is but very lately that you have
given your&s;elf the Trouble to read Romances.</P>
<P>I am not of your Opinion, &s;aid <HI>Arabella.</HI>
Sir <HI>George,</HI> que&s;tionle&s;s, has appropriated great
Part of his Time to the Peru&s;al of tho&s;e Books,
&s;o capable of improving him in all u&s;eful Know|lege;
the Sublimity of Love, and the Quinte&s;|&s;ence
of Valour; which Two Qualities, if po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
in a &s;uperlative Degree, form a true and
perfect Hero, as the Perfection of Beauty, Wit,
and Virtue, make a Heroine worthy to be &s;erved
by &s;uch an illu&s;trious Per&s;onage; and I dare
&s;ay, Sir <HI>George</HI> has profited &s;o much by the
great Examples of Fidelity and Courage he has
placed before his Eyes, that no Con&s;ideration
<PB N="231" REF="245">
whatever could make him for one Moment
fail in his Con&s;tancy to the Divine Beauty he
adores; and, in&s;pired by her Charms, he would
&s;corn to turn his Back, as my Uncle phra&s;es it,
upon an Army of an hundred thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>I am extremely obliged to you, Madam, &s;aid
Sir <HI>George,</HI> bowing his Head to the Ground,
to hide a Smile he could not po&s;&s;ibly re&s;train,
for the good Opinion you have of my Courage
and Fidelity.</P>
<P>As for Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Courage, Cou&s;in, &s;aid
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> laughing, I never di&s;puted it:
And though it be indeed a very extraordinary
Exertion of it, to fight &s;ingly again&s;t an Army
of an hundred thou&s;and Men; yet &s;ince you are
plea&s;ed to think it probable, I am as willing to
believe Sir <HI>George</HI> may do it as any other Man;
but, as for his Fidelity in Matters of Love, I
greatly &s;u&s;pect it, &s;ince he has been charged
with &s;ome very flagrant Crimes of that Na|ture.</P>
<P>How, Sir! re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> Have you ever
been faithle&s;s then? and, after having &s;worn,
haply, to devote your whole Life to the Service
of &s;ome Beauty, have you ever violated your
Oaths, and been ba&s;e enough to for&s;ake her?</P>
<P>I have too much Complai&s;ance, Madam,
&s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI> to contradict Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
who has been plea&s;ed po&s;itively to a&s;&s;ert, that
I have been faithle&s;s, as you mo&s;t unkindly
phra&s;e it.</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> this Accu&s;ation
is not of a Nature to be neglected; and though
a King &s;hould &s;ay it, I conceive, if you are
innocent, you have a Right to contradict him,
<PB N="232" REF="246">
and clear your&s;elf: Do you con&s;ider how deeply
this A&s;&s;ertion wounds your Honour and Happi|ne&s;s
for the future? What Lady, think you,
will receive your Services, loaded as you are
with the terrible Imputation of Incon&s;tancy?</P>
<P>Oh! as for that, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
I believe no Lady will think the wor&s;e
of Sir <HI>George</HI> for being faithle&s;s: For my
Part, I declare, nothing plea&s;es me &s;o much,
as gaining a Lover from another Lady; which
is a greater Compliment to one's Beauty, then
the Addre&s;&s;es of a Man that never was in Love
before&mdash;</P>
<P>You may remember, Cou&s;in, replied <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
that I &s;aid once before, your Spirit and
Humour re&s;embled a certain great Prince&s;s very
much; and I repeat it again, never was there
a greater Conformity in Tempers and Inclina|tions.</P>
<P>My Daughter, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> is mightily
obliged to you, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> for comparing her
to a great Prince&s;s: Undoubtedly you mean it
as a Compliment.</P>
<P>If you think, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> that barely com|paring
her to a Prince&s;s be a Compliment, I
mu&s;t take the Liberty to differ from you: My
Cou&s;in is not &s;o many Degrees below a Prince&s;s,
as that &s;uch a Compari&s;on &s;hould be thought
extraordinary; for if her Ance&s;tors did not
wear a Crown, they might, haply, have de&s;erved
it; and her Beauty may one Day procure her
a Servant, who&s;e Sword, like that of the great
<HI>Artaban,</HI> may win her a Sceptre; who, with a
noble Confidence, told his Prince&s;s, when the
Want of a Crown was objected to him, I wear
<PB N="233" REF="247">
a Sword, Madam, than can perform things
more difficult, that what you require; and if
a Crown be all that I want to make me worthy
of you, tell me what Kingdom in the World
you choo&s;e to reign in, and I will lay it at your
Feet.</P>
<P>That was a Promi&s;e, replied Sir <HI>George,</HI> fit
only for the great <HI>Artaban</HI> to make: But, Ma|dam,
if you will permit me to make any Com|pari&s;on
between that renowned Warrior and
my&s;elf, I would venture to tell you, that even
the great <HI>Artaban</HI> was not exempted from the
Character of Incon&s;tancy any more than my|&s;elf,
&s;ince, as you certainly know, he was in
Love with Three great Prince&s;&s;es &s;ucce&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P>I grant you, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> that <HI>Artaban</HI>
did wear the Chains of Three Prince&s;&s;es &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively:
But it mu&s;t al&s;o be remembred in his
Ju&s;tification, that the Two Fir&s;t of the&s;e Beau|ties
refu&s;ed his Adorations, and treated him with
Contempt, becau&s;e he was not a Prince: There|fore,
recovering his Liberty, by tho&s;e Di&s;dains
they ca&s;t on him, he pre&s;erved that illu&s;trious
Heart from De&s;pair, to tender it with more
pa&s;&s;ionate Fidelity to the Divine Prince&s;s of the
<HI>Parthians;</HI> who, though greatly their Superior
in Quality and Beauty, did permit him to love
her. However, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I find &s;ome|thing
like Levity in the Facility he found in
breaking his Fetters &s;o often; and when I con|&s;ider,
that among all tho&s;e great Heroes, who&s;e
Hi&s;tories I have read, none but him&s;elf ever
bore, without dying, the Cruelties he experi|enced
from tho&s;e Prince&s;&s;es, I am &s;ometimes
tempted to accu&s;e him my&s;elf of Incon&s;tancy:
<PB N="234" REF="248">
But indeed every thing we read of that Prodigy
of Valour is wholly miraculous; and &s;ince the
Performance of Impo&s;&s;ibilities was re&s;erved for
him, I conclude this Miracle al&s;o, among many
others, was po&s;&s;ible to him, whom nothing was
ever able to re&s;i&s;t upon Earth. However, pur|&s;ued
&s;he, ri&s;ing, I &s;hall not ab&s;olutely condemn
you, till I have heard your Adventures from
your own Mouth, at a convenient Time, when
I &s;hall be able to judge how far you merit the
odious Appellation of Incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he &s;aluted her Uncle, who had
for &s;ome time been conver&s;ing in a low Voice
with his Son, with a Grace wholly charming,
and retired to her Apartment. Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>
following her a few Moments after (the Com|pliment,
extravagant as it was, which &s;he had
paid her, having procured her &s;ome Good-will
from the vain and intere&s;ted Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>),
they conver&s;ed together with a great deal of
good Humour till Dinner-time, which, be|cau&s;e
Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> was not ab&s;olutely reco|vered,
was &s;erved in his Chamber.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which our Heroine is engaged in a new
Adventure.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> took a great deal of Pains
to turn the Di&s;cour&s;e upon Subjects, on
which the charming <HI>Arabella</HI> could expatiate,
<PB N="235" REF="249">
without any Mixture of that Ab&s;urdity, which
mingled it&s;elf in a great many others; the re&s;t
of that Day and &s;everal others, were pa&s;&s;ed
very agreeably: At the End of which, Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> being perfectly recovered, and able to
go abroad; the Baronet propo&s;ed to take the
Diver&s;ion of Hunting; which <HI>Arabella,</HI> who
was u&s;ed to it, con&s;ented to partake of; but
being informed, that Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> could not
ride, and cho&s;e to &s;tay at home, &s;he would
have kept her Company, had not Sir <HI>Charles</HI>
in&s;i&s;ted upon the contrary.</P>
<P>As Sir <HI>George,</HI> and &s;ome other Gentlemen,
had invited them&s;elves to be of the Party; <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
on her coming down to mount her Hor&s;e,
found a great many young Gallants, ready to
offer her their A&s;&s;i&s;tance upon this Occa&s;ion:
Accepting therefore, with great Politene&s;s, this
Help from a Stranger, who was neare&s;t her, &s;he
mounted her Hor&s;e, giving Occa&s;ion to every
one that was pre&s;ent, to admire the Grace with
which &s;he &s;at and managed him. Her Shape
being as perfect as any Shape could po&s;&s;ibly be,
her Riding-habit di&s;covered all its Beauties:
Her Hat, and the white Feather waving over
Part of her fine black Hair, gave a peculiar
Charm to her lovely Face: And &s;he appeared
with &s;o many Advantages in this Dre&s;s and
Po&s;ture, that Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> forgetting all her
Ab&s;urdities, was wholly lo&s;t in the Contempla|tion
of &s;o many Charms, as her whole Per&s;on
was adorned with.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> though he really admired <HI>Arabella,</HI>
was not &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately in Love as Mr. <HI>Glan|ville;</HI>
and, being a keen Sport&s;man, eagerly pur|&s;ued
<PB N="236" REF="250">
the Game, with the re&s;t of the Hunters;
but Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> minded nothing but his Cou|&s;in,
and kept clo&s;e by her.</P>
<P>After having rode a long time, <HI>Arabella,</HI> con|ceiving
it a Piece of Cruelty, not to give her
Lover an Opportunity of talking to her, as, by
his extreme Solicitude, he &s;eemed ardently to
de&s;ire, coming to a delightful Valley, &s;he &s;top|ped;
and told Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> that, being weary
of the Chace, &s;he &s;hould alight, and repo&s;e
her&s;elf a little under the Shade of tho&s;e Trees.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> extremely plea&s;ed at this
Propo&s;ition, di&s;mounted; and, having helped
her to alight, &s;eated him&s;elf by her on the
Gra&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> expecting he would begin to talk to
her of his Pa&s;&s;ion, could not help blu&s;hing at the
Thoughts of having given him &s;uch an Oppor|tunity;
and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> endeavouring to ac|commodate
him&s;elf to her Ideas of a Lover,
expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in Terms extravagant enough
to have made a rea&s;onable Woman think he
was making a Je&s;t of her: All which, how|ever,
<HI>Arabella</HI> was extremely plea&s;ed with; and
&s;he ob&s;erved &s;uch a ju&s;t Decorum in her An|&s;wers,
that, as the Writers of Romance phra&s;e
it, if &s;he did not give him any ab&s;olute Hopes
of being beloved, yet &s;he &s;aid enough to make
him conclude &s;he did not hate him.</P>
<P>They had conver&s;ed in this manner near a
Quarter of an Hour, when <HI>Arabella,</HI> perceiving
a Man at a little Di&s;tance, walking very com|po&s;edly,
&s;hrieked out aloud; and, ri&s;ing with the
utmo&s;t Precipitation, flew from Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI>
and went to untie her Hor&s;e; while his A&s;to|ni&s;hment
<PB N="237" REF="251">
being &s;o great at her Behaviour, that
he could not, for a Moment or two, a&s;k her
the Cau&s;e of her Fear&mdash;</P>
<P>Do you not &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, out of Breath with
the Violence of her Apprehen&s;ions, the Per&s;on
who is coming towards us? It is the &s;ame,
who, &s;ome Months ago, attempted to carry me
away, when I was riding out with only Two
Attendants: I e&s;caped, for that time, the Dan|ger
that threatened me; but, que&s;tionle&s;s, he
comes now to renew his Attempts: Therefore
can you wonder at my Fear?</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be as you &s;ay, Madam, inter|rupted
<HI>Glanville,</HI> What Rea&s;on have you to
fear? Do you not think I am able to defend
you?</P>
<P>Ah! without Doubt, you are able to de|fend
me, an&s;wered &s;he; and though, if you
offer to re&s;i&s;t the Violence he comes to u&s;e
again&s;t me, he will, haply, call Two or Three
Dozen armed Men to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, who are,
I &s;uppo&s;e, concealed hereabouts, yet I am
not apprehen&s;ive, that you will be wor&s;ted
by them: But as it happened to the brave <HI>Juba,</HI>
and <HI>Cleomedon,</HI> while they were fighting with
&s;ome hundred Men, who wanted to carry away
their Prince&s;&s;es before their Faces; and were
giving Death at every Blow, in order to pre|&s;erve
them; the Commander of the&s;e Ravi&s;h|ers,
&s;eeing the Two Prince&s;&s;es &s;itting, as I
was, under a Tree, ordered them to be
&s;eized by Two of his Men, and carried away,
while the Two Princes were lo&s;ing be&s;t Part of
of their Blood in their Defence; therefore,
to prevent &s;uch an Accident happening, while
<PB N="238" REF="252">
you are fighting for my Re&s;cue, I think it will
be the &s;afe&s;t Way for me to get on Hor&s;e|back,
that I may be in a Condition to e&s;cape;
and that you may not employ your Valour to
no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Saying this, having, with Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
A&s;&s;i&s;tance, loo&s;ed her Hor&s;e from the Tree, he
helped her to mount, and then remounted his
own.</P>
<P>Your Antagoni&s;t, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> is on Foot;
and therefore, though I prize your Life ex|tremely,
yet I cannot di&s;pen&s;e with my&s;elf
from telling you, that 'tis again&s;t the Laws of
Knighthood to take any Advantage of that
kind over your Enemy; nor will I permit your
Concern for my Safety to make you forget
what you owe to your own Reputation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> fretting exce&s;&s;ively at her
Folly, begged her not to make her&s;elf unea&s;y
about things that were never likely to hap|pen.</P>
<P>The Gentleman yonder, added he, &s;eems to
have no De&s;igns to make any Attempt again&s;t
you: If he &s;hould, I &s;hall know how to deal
with him: But, &s;ince he neither offers to a&s;&s;ault
me, nor affront you, I think we ought not to
give him any Rea&s;on to imagine we &s;u&s;pect him,
by gazing on him thus; and letting him under|&s;tand
by your Manner, that he is the Subject of
our Conver&s;ation: If you plea&s;e, Madam, we
will endeavour to join our Company.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> while he was &s;peaking, kept her
Eyes fixed upon his Face, with Looks which
expre&s;&s;ed her Thoughts were labouring upon
&s;ome very important Point: And, after a Pau&s;e
<PB N="239" REF="253">
of &s;ome Moments, Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid &s;he, with
a Tone of extreme Surprize, that I &s;hould be
&s;o mi&s;taken in you? Do you really want Cou|rage
enough to defend me again&s;t that Ra|vi&s;her?</P>
<P>Oh Heavens! Madam, interrupted <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
try not my Temper thus: Courage
enough to defend you! 'Sdeath! you will make
me mad! Who, in the Name of Wonder, is
going to mole&s;t you?</P>
<P>He whom you &s;ee there, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
pointing to him with her Finger: For know,
cold and in&s;en&s;ible as thou art to the Danger
which threatens me, yonder Knight is thy Ri|val,
and a Rival, haply, who de&s;erves my E&s;teem
better than thou do&s;t; &s;ince, if he has Courage
enough to get me by Violence into his Power,
that &s;ame Courage would make him defend
me again&s;t any Injuries I might be offered from
another: And &s;ince nothing is &s;o contempti|ble
in the Eyes of a Woman, as a Lover who
wants Spirit to die in her Defence; know, I
can &s;ooner pardon him, whom thou would
cowardly fly from, for the Violence which he
meditates again&s;t me, than thy&s;elf for the
Pu&s;illanimity thou ha&s;t betrayed in my Sight.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Words, &s;he galloped away from
her a&s;toni&s;hed Lover; who, not daring to follow
her, for fear of increa&s;ing her Su&s;picions of his
Cowardice, flung him&s;elf off his Hor&s;e in a vio|lent
Rage; and, forgetting that the Stranger was
ob&s;erving, and now within Hearing, he fell ac|cu&s;ing
and exclaiming again&s;t the Books, that
had turned his Cou&s;in's Brain; and railing at
his own ill Fate, that condemned him to the
<PB N="240" REF="254">
Puni&s;hment of loving her. Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> (for it
really was he, whom an Affair of Con&s;equence
had brought again into the Country), hearing
&s;ome of Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s la&s;t Words, and ob|&s;erving
the Ge&s;tures he u&s;ed, concluded he
had been treated like him&s;elf by <HI>Arabella,</HI> whom
he knew again at a Di&s;tance: Therefore coming
up to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> laughing&mdash;</P>
<P>Though I have not the Honour of knowing
you, Sir, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t beg the Favour you
will inform me, if you are not di&s;turbed at the
ridiculous Folly of the Lady I &s;aw with you
ju&s;t now? She is the mo&s;t fanta&s;tical Creature
that ever lived, and, in my Opinion, fit for a
Mad-hou&s;e: Pray, are you acquainted with
her?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being in a very ill Humour,
could not brook the Freedom of this Language
again&s;t his Cou&s;in, who&s;e Follies he could not
bear any one &s;hould rail at but him&s;elf; and, be|ing
provoked at his Sneers, and the Interruption
he had given to their Conver&s;ation, he looked
upon him with a di&s;dainful Frown, and told him
in an haughty Tone, That he was very imper|tinent
to &s;peak of a Lady of her Quality and
Merit &s;o rudely.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, I beg your Pardon, replied Mr.
<HI>Harvey,</HI> laughing more than before; What, I
&s;uppo&s;e, you are the Champion of this fair Lady!
But, I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, if you intend to quar|rel
with every one that will laugh at her, you
will have more Bu&s;ine&s;s upon your Hands than
you can well manage.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> tran&s;ported with Rage at this
In&s;olence, hit him &s;uch a Blow with the But|-End

Moment; but recovering him&s;elf, he drew his

made a Pu&s;h at <HI>Glanville;</HI> who, avoiding
it with great Dexterity, had recour&s;e to his
Hanger for his Defence.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> in the mean time, who had not rid
far, concealing her&s;elf behind &s;ome Trees, &s;aw
all the Actions of her Lover, and intended
Ravi&s;her; and, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an Opinion
of her Cou&s;in's Cowardice, was extremely re|joiced
to &s;ee him fall upon his Enemy fir&s;t, and
that with &s;o much Fury, that &s;he had no longer
any Rea&s;on to doubt his Courage: Her Su&s;pi|cions,
therefore, being removed, her Tender|ne&s;s
for him returned; and when &s;he &s;aw
them engaged with their Swords (for, at that
Di&s;tance, &s;he did not plainly perceive the Dif|ference
of their Weapons), her Apprehen&s;ions
for her Cou&s;in were &s;o &s;trong, that, though &s;he
did not doubt his Valour, &s;he could not bear
to &s;ee him expo&s;e his Life for her: And, with|out
making any Reflections upon the Singularity
of her De&s;ign, &s;he was going to ride up to them,
and endeavour to part them; when &s;he &s;aw &s;e|veral
Men come towards them, whom &s;he took
to be the A&s;&s;i&s;tants of her Ravi&s;her, though
they were, in reality, Haymakers; who, at a
Di&s;tance, having &s;een the Beginning of their
Quarrel, had ha&s;tened to part them.</P>
<P>Terrified, therefore, at this Reinforcement,
which &s;he thought would expo&s;e her Cou&s;in to
great Danger, &s;he galloped, with all Speed,
after the Hunters, being directed by the Sound
of the Horn. Her Anxiety for her Cou&s;in made
<PB N="242" REF="256">
her regardle&s;s of her own Danger, &s;o that &s;he
rode with a &s;urpri&s;ing Swiftne&s;s; and, overtaking
the Company, &s;he would have &s;poken, to tell
them of her Cou&s;in's Situation; when her
Spirits failing her, &s;he could only make a Sign
with her Hand, and &s;unk down in a Swoon, in
the Arms of Sir <HI>George,</HI> who eagerly galloped
up to her; and, &s;upporting her as well as he
was able till &s;ome others came to her Relief,
they took her off her Hor&s;e, and placed her
upon the Ground; when, by the Help of &s;ome
Water they brought from a Spring near them,
in a little time &s;he came to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who, &s;eeing her come up to them
without his Son, and by her fainting, concluded
&s;ome Misfortune had happened to him, the

Where he was?</P>
<P>Your Son, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;ighing, is, with a
Valour equal to that of the brave <HI>Cleomedon,</HI>
this Moment fighting in my Defence again&s;t a
Croud of Enemies; and is, haply, &s;hedding
the la&s;t Drop of his Blood in my Quarrel.</P>
<P>Shedding the la&s;t Drop of his Blood, <HI>haply!</HI>
interrupted Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> exce&s;&s;ively grieved; and,
not a little enraged at <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he
had introduced him into &s;ome Quarrel, It may
be <HI>happy</HI> for you, Madam; but I am &s;ure it
will make me very mi&s;erable, if my Son comes
to any Harm.</P>
<P>If it be the Will of Heaven he &s;hould fall in
this Combat, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> he can never
have a more glorious De&s;tiny: And as that
Con&s;ideration will, doubtle&s;s, &s;weeten his la&s;t
Moments, &s;o it ought to be your Con&s;olation:
<PB N="243" REF="257">
However, I beg you'll lo&s;e no time, but ha&s;te
to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; for &s;ince he has a con&s;iderable
Number of Enemies to deal with, 'tis not im|probable
but he may be overpowered at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Where did you leave my Son, Madam? cried
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> eagerly.</P>
<P>He is not far off, replied <HI>Arabella:</HI> And you

Sight of the Blood of his Enemies, which he
has &s;pilt. Go that way, pur&s;ued &s;he, pointing
with her Finger towards the Place where &s;he
had left her Cou&s;in: There you will meet with
him, amid&s;t a Croud of Foes, which he is &s;a|cri&s;icing
to my Safety, and his ju&s;t Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> not knowing what to think, gal|loped
away, followed by mo&s;t Part of the Com|pany;
Sir <HI>George</HI> telling Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> that he
would &s;tay to defend her again&s;t any Attempts
that might be made on her Liberty, by any of
her Ravi&s;her's Servants, who were, probably,
&s;traggling about. <HI>Arabella,</HI> however, being
perfectly recovered, in&s;i&s;ted upon following her
Uncle.</P>
<P>There is no Que&s;tion, &s;aid &s;he, but Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> is victorious: I am only apprehen&s;ive

<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> who wanted to engro&s;s her Com|pany

it would be dangerous for her to venture

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being a Chapter of Mi&s;takes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Charles,</HI> who, by this Time, had got
to the Place &s;he directed him to, but &s;aw
no Appearance of fighting, and only a few
Haymakers in Di&s;cour&s;e together, inquired, If
there had been any Quarrel between two Gentle|men
in that Place?</P>
<P>One of them, at this Que&s;tion, advancing,
told Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that two Gentlemen had quar|relled
there, and were fighting with Swords;
but that they had parted them; and that one of
them, having an Hor&s;e tied to a Tree, mounted
him, and rode away: That the other, they be|lieved,
was not far off; and that there had
been no Blood&s;hed, they having come time
enough to prevent it.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was extremely &s;atisfied with this
Account; and, giving the Haymakers &s;ome
Money for the good Office they did in parting
the two Combatants, rode up to meet Lady
<HI>Bella;</HI> and informed her, that his Son was &s;afe.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine he is &s;afe, replied &s;he, when
I &s;ee &s;ome of his Enemies (pointing to the Hay|makers)
&s;till alive: It is not cu&s;tomary, in tho&s;e
Ca&s;es, to &s;uffer any to e&s;cape: And, que&s;tion|le&s;s,
<PB N="245" REF="259">
my Cou&s;in is either dead, or a Pri&s;oner,
&s;ince all his Adver&s;aries are not vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Why, you dream, Madam, replied Sir <HI>Charles:</HI>
Tho&s;e Fellows yonder are Haymakers: What
&s;hould make them Enemies to my Son? They
were lucky enough to come in time to prevent
him and another Gentleman from doing each
other a Mi&s;chief. I cannot imagine for what
Rea&s;on my Son quarrelled with that Per&s;on they
&s;peak of: Perhaps you can inform me.</P>
<P>Certainly, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> I can inform you,
&s;ince I was the Cau&s;e of their Quarrel. The
Story is too long to tell you now; and, be&s;ides,
it is &s;o connected with the other Accidents of
my Life, that 'tis nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould be ac|quainted
with my whole Hi&s;tory, in order to
comprehend it: But, if tho&s;e Per&s;ons are what
you &s;ay, and did really part my Cou&s;in and his
Antagoni&s;t, truly I believe they have done him
a very ill Office: For, I am per&s;uaded, my
Cou&s;in will never be at Re&s;t, till, by his Rival's
Death, he has freed him&s;elf from one, capable of
the mo&s;t daring Enterprizes to get me into his
Power: And, &s;ince I cannot be in Security
while he lives, and per&s;i&s;ts in the Re&s;olution he
has taken to per&s;ecute me, it had been better if
he had &s;uffered all the Effects of my Cou&s;in's
Re&s;entment at that time, than to give him the
Trouble to hunt him through the World, in
order to &s;acrifice him to the Intere&s;t of his Love
and Vengeance.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed than alarmed
at this Di&s;covery of his Niece's &s;anguinary Sen|timents,
told her, he was &s;orry to &s;ee a Lady &s;o
far forget the Gentlene&s;s of her Sex, as to en|courage
<PB N="246" REF="260">
and incite Men to &s;uch Extremities,
upon her Account. And, for the future, added
he, I mu&s;t intreat you, Niece, to &s;pare me the
Affliction of &s;eeing my Son expo&s;ed to the&s;e
dangerous Quarrels: For, though his Life is &s;o
little regarded by you, yet it is of the utmo&s;t
Con&s;equence to me.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who found Matter &s;ufficient in the
Beginning of this Speech, to be offended with
her Uncle, yet, mi&s;taking the latter Part of it
for a pathetic Complaint of her Cruelty, re|plied
very gravely, That her Cou&s;in's Safety
was not &s;o indifferent to her as he imagined:
And that &s;he did not hate him &s;o much, but
that his Death would affect her very &s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> in &s;peaking the&s;e Words, blu&s;hed
with Shame, as thinking they were rather too
tender: And Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who coloured like|wi&s;e,
from a very different Motive, was open|ing
his Mouth, to tell her, that he did not
think his Son was much obliged to her for not
hating him; when <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing he de|&s;igned
to pre&s;s her to a further Explanation of
the favourable Sentiments &s;he felt for Mr.
<HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;topped him with Precipitation: Pre&s;s
me no more, &s;aid &s;he, upon this Subject: And,
as I have already &s;poken too much, haply, be|fore
&s;o many Witne&s;&s;es, &s;eek not to enhance
my Confu&s;ion, by prolonging to Di&s;cour&s;e that
at pre&s;ent mu&s;t needs be di&s;agreeable to me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall readily agree with you, Madam, re|plied
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that you have &s;poken too
much: And, if I had thought you capable of
&s;peaking in the manner you have done, I
<PB N="247" REF="261">
would have been more cautious in giving you
an Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould imagine, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> blu&s;h|ing
with Anger, as &s;he before did with Shame,
that you would be the la&s;t Per&s;on in the World
who could think I had &s;poken too much upon
this Occa&s;ion: And, &s;ince you are plea&s;ed to
tell me &s;o, I think it fit to let you know, that I
have not, in my Opinion, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the
Laws of Decency and Decorum, in what I
have &s;aid in my Cou&s;in's Favour: And I can
produce many Examples of greater Freedom of
Speech, in Prince&s;&s;es, and Ladies of the highe&s;t
Quality: However, I &s;hall learn &s;uch a Le&s;&s;on
of Moderation in this re&s;pect, from your Re|proof,
that I promi&s;e you, neither your&s;elf, or
Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;hall have any Cau&s;e, for the
future, to complain of my want of Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> who was very polite and good-natured,
was half angry with him&s;elf, for hav|ing
obliged his Niece to &s;uch a Submi&s;&s;ion, as
he thought it; and, apologizing for the Rude|ne&s;s
of his Reprehen&s;ion, a&s;&s;ured her, that he
was perfectly convinced of her Di&s;cretion in all
things; and did not doubt but her Conduct
would be always agreeable to him.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who, from what her Uncle had
&s;aid, began to entertain Su&s;picions, that would
never have entered any Imagination but hers,
looked earne&s;tly upon him for half a Moment,
as if &s;he wi&s;hed to penetrate into the mo&s;t
&s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es of his Heart: But, fan&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ing &s;he
&s;aw &s;omething in his Looks that confirmed her
Apprehen&s;ions, &s;he removed her Eyes from his
Face, and, fa&s;tening them on the Ground, re|mained
<PB N="248" REF="262">
for &s;ome Moments in Confu&s;ion.&mdash;Sir
<HI>Charles,</HI> whom her apparent Di&s;turbance made
very unea&s;y, propo&s;ed returning to the Ca&s;tle;
telling Lady <HI>Bella</HI> he expected to find his Son
already there.</P>
<P>'Tis more than probable, &s;aid &s;he, turning to
Sir <HI>George,</HI> that my Cou&s;in is gone in Pur&s;uit
of my Ravi&s;her; and the Interruption that has
been given to his de&s;igned Vengeance, making
him more furious than before, 'tis not likely he
will return till he has puni&s;hed his In&s;olence by
that Death he &s;o ju&s;tly merits.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> is already &s;o happy in your
Opinion, &s;aid Sir <HI>George,</HI> with a very profound
Sigh, that there is no need of his rendering you
this &s;mall Service, to increa&s;e your E&s;teem:
But, if my Prayers are heard, the Puni&s;hment
of your Ravi&s;her will be re&s;erved for a Per&s;on
le&s;s fortunate, indeed, than Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> tho'
not le&s;s devoted to your Intere&s;t, and concerned
in your Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George</HI> counterfeiting a Look of extreme
Confu&s;ion and Fear, as he ended the&s;e Words;</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who perfectly comprehended the
Meaning they were de&s;igned to convey, thought
her&s;elf obliged to take no Notice of them: And,
therefore, without making any Reply to the
young Baronet, who ventured &s;lowly to lift his
Eyes to her Face, in order to di&s;cover if there
were any Signs of Anger in it, &s;he told Sir
<HI>Charles</HI> &s;he inclined to go home: And Sir
<HI>George,</HI> with the re&s;t of the Company, attended
them to the Ca&s;tle; where, as &s;oon as they ar|rived,
they took their Leave.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="263">
Sir <HI>George,</HI> notwith&s;tanding <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Care
to deprive him of an Opportunity of &s;peaking
to her, told her, in a Whi&s;per, having eagerly
alighted to help her off her Hor&s;e,</P>
<P>I am going, Madam, to find out that in&s;o|lent
Man, who has dared to offer Violence to
the faire&s;t Per&s;on in the World: And, if I am
&s;o happy as to meet with him, he &s;hall either take
my Life, or I will put him into a Condition never
to commit any more Offences of that Nature.</P>
<P>Saying this, he made a low Bow; and, be|ing
de&s;irous to prevent her An&s;wer, remounted
his Hor&s;e, and went away with the re&s;t of the
Company.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who, upon this Occa&s;ion, was to
be all Confu&s;ion, mixed with &s;ome little Re|&s;entment,
di&s;covered &s;o much Emotion in her
Looks, while Sir <HI>George</HI> was whi&s;pering to her,
that her Uncle, as he was handing her into the
Hou&s;e, a&s;ked her, If &s;he was offended at any
thing Sir <HI>George</HI> had &s;aid to her?</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> con&s;truing this Que&s;tion as &s;he had
done &s;ome other things her Uncle had &s;aid to
her, replied, in a re&s;erved manner, Since my
Looks, contrary to my Intention, have betrayed
my Thoughts to you, I will not &s;cruple to con|fe&s;s,
that I have &s;ome Cau&s;e to be offended
with Sir <HI>George;</HI> and that, in two In&s;tances
To-day, he has &s;eemed to forget the Re&s;pect
he owes me.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was fired at this Account: Is it
po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, that Sir <HI>George</HI> has had the
A&s;&s;urance to &s;ay any thing to offend you, and
that before my Face too? This Affront is not
to be borne.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="264">
I am &s;orry, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> eying him heed|fully,
to &s;ee you &s;o much concerned at it.</P>
<P>Don't be unea&s;y, interrupted Sir <HI>Charles:</HI>
There will be no bad Con&s;equences happen from

his Voice with Pa&s;&s;ion: I'll force him this Night

<P>You mu&s;t pardon me, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI>
more and more confirmed in her Notions, if I

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Mi&s;takes are continued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> appeared, the two
Ladies retired; Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> a&s;king
<HI>Arabella</HI> a hundred Que&s;tions concerning their
Diver&s;ion, the Drift of which was, to know
how Sir <HI>George</HI> behaved to her: But that fair
<PB N="251" REF="265">
Lady, who&s;e Thoughts were wholly employed
on the &s;trange Accidents which had happened to
her that Day, longed to be at Liberty to indulge
her Reflections; and, complaining of extreme
Wearine&s;s, under Pretence of repo&s;ing her&s;elf
till Dinner, got quit of Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Com|pany,
which, at that time, &s;he thought very
tedious.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was left to her&s;elf, her Imagi|nation
running over all that had happened, &s;he
could not help confe&s;&s;ing, that few Women ever
met with &s;uch a Variety of Adventures in one
Day: In Danger of being carried off by Vio|lence,
by one Lover; delivered by another;
In&s;inuations of Love from a Third, who, &s;he
thought, was enamoured of her Cou&s;in; and,
what was &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing a Di&s;covery, that
her Uncle was not in&s;en&s;ible of her Charms,
but was become the Rival of his own Son.</P>
<P>As extravagant as this Notion was, <HI>Arabella</HI>
found Precedents in her Romances of Pa&s;&s;ions
full as &s;trange and unju&s;tifiable; and confirmed
her&s;elf in that Opinion, by recollecting &s;everal
Examples of unlawful Love. Why &s;hould I
not believe, &s;aid &s;he, that my Charms can
work as powerful Effects as tho&s;e of <HI>Olympia,</HI>
Prince&s;s of <HI>Thrace,</HI> who&s;e Brother was pa&s;&s;ion|ately
enamoured of her?</P>
<P>Did not the Divine <HI>Clelia</HI> in&s;pire <HI>Maherbal</HI>
with a violent Pa&s;&s;ion for her, who, though
di&s;covered to be her Brother, did not, never|thele&s;s,
cea&s;e to adore her? And, to bring an
In&s;tance &s;till nearer to my own Ca&s;e, was not
the Uncle of the fair <HI>Alcyone</HI> in Love with her?
<PB N="252" REF="266">
And did he not endeavour to win her Heart by
all the Methods in his Power?</P>
<P>Ah! then, pur&s;ued &s;he, let us doubt no
more of our Misfortune: And, &s;ince our fatal
Beauty has rai&s;ed this impious Flame, let us
&s;tifle it with our Rigour, and not allow an ill|timed
Pity, or Re&s;pect, to encourage a Pa&s;&s;ion
which may, one Day, ca&s;t a Blemi&s;h upon our
Glory.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> having &s;ettled this Point, proceed|ed
to reflect on the Conque&s;t &s;he had made of
Sir <HI>George:</HI> She examined his Words over and
over, and found them &s;o exactly conformable to
the Language of an <HI>Oroondates</HI> or <HI>Oronces,</HI> that
&s;he could not choo&s;e but be plea&s;ed: But, recol|lecting
that it behoved her, like all other He|roines,
to be extremely troubled and perplexed
at an In&s;inuation of Love, &s;he began to lament
the cruel Nece&s;&s;ity of parting with an agreeable
Friend; who, if he per&s;i&s;ted in making her
acquainted with his Thoughts, would expofe
him&s;elf to the Treatment Per&s;ons &s;o indi&s;creet
always meet with; nor was &s;he le&s;s concerned,
le&s;t, if Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI> had not already di&s;patched
her Ravi&s;her, Sir <HI>George,</HI> by wandering in
Search of him, and, haply, &s;acrificing him to
his eager De&s;ire of &s;erving her, &s;hould, by that
means, lay her under an Obligation to him,
which, con&s;idering him as a Lover, would be a
great Mortification.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>George,</HI> however, was gone home to his
own Hou&s;e, with no Thoughts of pur&s;uing
<HI>Arabella</HI>'s Ravi&s;her: And Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> being
que&s;tioned by his Father concerning his Quar|rel,
invented &s;ome trifling Excu&s;e for it; which
<PB N="253" REF="267">
not agreeing with the Account the Baronet had
received from <HI>Arabella,</HI> he told his Son, that
he had concealed the Truth from him; and that
there was more in that Affair than he had
owned. You quarrelled, added he, upon <HI>Ara|bella</HI>'s
Account; and &s;he did not &s;cruple to af|firm
it before all the Company.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who had vainly flattered him|&s;elf
with an Hope, that his Cou&s;in had not ac|quainted
the Company with her whim&s;ical Ap|prehen&s;ions,
was extremely vexed when he
found &s;he had expo&s;ed her&s;elf to their Ridicule,
and that it was probable even he had not e&s;caped:
But, willing to know from her own Mouth how
far &s;he had carried her Folly, he went up to
her Chamber; and, being immediately admit|ted,
&s;he began to congratulate him upon the
Conque&s;t he had gained, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, over
his Enemy; and thanked him very &s;olemnly for
the Security he had procured for her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> after a&s;&s;uring her, that &s;he was
in no Danger of ever being carried away by that
Per&s;on whom &s;he feared, proceeded to inquire
into all that had pa&s;&s;ed between her and the
Company whom &s;he had joined, when &s;he left
him; and <HI>Arabella,</HI> relating every Particular,
gave him the Mortification to know, that her
Folly had been &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed: But &s;he
touched upon her Fears for him with &s;o much
Delicacy, and mentioned her Fainting in &s;uch
a manner, as in&s;inuated a much greater Tender|ne&s;s
than he before had Rea&s;on to hope for;
and this Knowlege de&s;troying all his Intentions
to quarrel with her for what &s;he had &s;aid, he
appeared &s;o ea&s;y and &s;atisfied, that <HI>Arabella,</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="268">
reflecting upon the Misfortune his Father's new|born
Pa&s;&s;ion would probably be the Occa&s;ion of
to him, could not help &s;ighing at the Appre|hen&s;ion;
looking on him, at the &s;ame time,
with a kind of pitying Complacency; which
did not e&s;cape Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s Notice.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t know the Rea&s;on of that Sigh, Cou&s;in,
&s;aid he, &s;miling, and taking her Hand.</P>
<P>If you are wi&s;e, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> gravely,
you will be contented to remain in the plea&s;ing
Ignorance you are at pre&s;ent; and not &s;eek to
know a thing which will, haply, afford you but
little Satisfaction.</P>
<P>You have increa&s;ed my Curo&s;ity &s;o much
by this Advice, re&s;umed he, accommodating
his Looks to <HI>Arabella</HI>'s, that I &s;hall not be at
Re&s;t till I know what it is you conceal from
me: And, &s;ince I am &s;o much concerned in it,
even by your own Confe&s;&s;ion, I have a Right
to pre&s;s you to explain your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Since you are &s;o importunate, replied <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
I mn&s;t tell you, that I will not do you
&s;o great a Di&s;kindne&s;s, as to explain my&s;elf;
nor will I be the fir&s;t who &s;hall acquaint you
with your Misfortune, &s;ince you will, haply,
too &s;oon arrive at the Knowlege of it, by other
means.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> who imagined this was &s;ome new
Whim that had got into her Head, was but
little perplexed at an In&s;inuation, which, had
he been ignorant of her Foible, would have
given him great Unea&s;ine&s;s: But, being &s;en&s;ible
that &s;he expected he would pre&s;s her to di&s;clo&s;e
her&s;elf, and appear extremely concerned at her
refu&s;ing him that Satisfaction, he counterfeited
<PB N="255" REF="269">
&s;o well, that &s;he was at a lo&s;s how to evade the

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In which the Mi&s;takes are not yet cleared up.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Baronet, who had been put into a
bad Humour by <HI>Arabella</HI>'s In&s;inuations,
that Sir <HI>George</HI> had affronted her, appeared re|&s;erved
and unea&s;y; and, being re&s;olved to
que&s;tion her about it, was willing fir&s;t to know
exactly what it was his Niece had been offended
at: But as he feared, if it came to his Son's
Knowlege, it would produce a Quarrel between
the young Gentlemen, that might have dan|gerous
Con&s;equences, he was de&s;irous of &s;peak|ing
to her alone; and, as &s;oon as Dinner was
over, a&s;ked her to take a Walk with him upon
the Terrace, telling her he had &s;omething to
&s;ay to her in private. <HI>Arabella,</HI> who&s;e Fears
had been con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the Pen&s;ive|ne&s;s
which appeared in her Uncle's Looks du|ring
Dinner, and &s;uppo&s;ing he wanted a pri|vate
Conver&s;ation, only to explain him&s;elf more
clearly to her, than he had yet done, was ex|ce&s;&s;ively
alarmed at this Reque&s;t; and, ca&s;ting
her Eyes down to the Ground, blu&s;hed in &s;uch
<PB N="256" REF="270">
a manner as betrayed her Confu&s;ion; and made
Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> and her Brother believe, that &s;he
&s;u&s;pected her Uncle had a De&s;ign to pre&s;s her
&s;oon to give her Hand to Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> which
occa&s;ioned her apparent Di&s;order.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> however, who had not &s;o heed|fully
ob&s;erved her Behaviour, repeated his Re|que&s;t;
adding, with a Smile, upon her giving
him no An&s;wer, Sure, Lady <HI>Bella,</HI> you are
not afraid to be alone with your Uncle.</P>
<P>No, Sir, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> giving him a
piercing Look; I am not afraid of being alone
with my Uncle; and, as long as he pretends to
be no more than my Uncle, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to
hear what he has to &s;ay to me.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> a little vexed at an An&s;wer which
in&s;inuated, as he thought, a Complaint of his
having pretended to more Authority over her
than he ought, told her, he hoped &s;he had no
Cau&s;e to believe he would di&s;plea&s;e her, by any
improper Exertion of that Power over her, with
which her Father had intru&s;ted him: For I a&s;&s;ure
you, added he, I would rather you &s;hould follow
my Advice as an Uncle, than obey me as a Guar|dian;
and, &s;ince my Affection for you is, pre|haps,
greater than what many People have for
a Niece, my Solicitude ought to be imputed to
that Motive.</P>
<P>I have all the Sen&s;e I ought to have of that
Affection you honour me with, replied <HI>Ara|bella;</HI>
and &s;ince I hope it will be always what
it &s;hould be, without wi&s;hing for its Increa&s;e, I
am contented with tho&s;e Te&s;timonies I have
already received of it; and do not de&s;ire any
other.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="271">
Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> a little puzzled to under&s;tand the
Meaning of the&s;e Words, which the grave
Looks of <HI>Arabella</HI> made yet more my&s;terious,
ro&s;e from his Seat with an Air of Di&s;content: I
&s;hould have been glad to have &s;poken a Word in
private to you, Niece, &s;aid &s;he; but, &s;ince you
think proper to make &s;o much Ceremony in &s;uch
a Trifle, I'll defer it till you are in a better Hu|mour.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;eeing her Father going out
of the Room, &s;tepped before him: Nay, Papa,
&s;aid &s;he, if you want to &s;peak with my Cou&s;in,
my Brother and I will go out, and leave you to
your&s;elves.</P>
<P>You will do me a very great Di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;aid
<HI>Arabella;</HI> for, I am &s;ure, my Uncle has not
any thing of Con&s;equence to &s;ay to me: How|exer,
added &s;he, &s;eeing Mi&s;s <HI>Glanville</HI> go away,
I am re&s;olved, I will not be left alone; and
therefore, Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> &s;ince I can pretend to
&s;ome Power over you, I command you to &s;tay.</P>
<P>You may remember, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
with a Smile, you refu&s;ed to gratify my
Curio&s;ity, with regard to &s;omething you hinted
to me &s;ome time ago; and, to puni&s;h you, added
he, going out of the Room, I am re&s;olved you
&s;hall li&s;ten to what my Father has to &s;ay to you;
for, by your Unwillingne&s;s to hear it, I ima|gine
you &s;u&s;pect already what it is.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> finding &s;he had no way to avoid
hearing what &s;he dreaded &s;o much, and ob&s;erv|ing
her Uncle had re&s;umed his Chair, pre|pared
to give him Audience; but, in order to
deprive him of all Hope, that &s;he would receive
his Di&s;cour&s;e favourably, &s;he a&s;&s;umed the &s;e|vere&s;t
<PB N="258" REF="272">
Look &s;he was capable of; and, ca&s;ting
her Eyes on the Ground, with a Mixture of
Anger and Shame, waited with a kind of Fear
and Impatience for what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, Madam, &s;aid the Baronet, ob&s;erving
her Confu&s;ion, that you apprehend what I am
going to &s;ay to you; but, I be&s;eech you, do not
fear I have any Intentions, but &s;uch as you'll
approve.</P>
<P>You are certainly in the right, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
in the Interpretation you have put on my
Looks: I am really in Pain about the Purport
of your Di&s;cour&s;e: And you would particu|larly
oblige me, if you would di&s;pen&s;e with me
from hearing it.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> that, out of a mi&s;|taken
Fear, you are unwilling to hear me, in
order to avoid coming to the Explanation I de|&s;ire:
But I tell you, once again, you have no|thing
to apprehend.</P>
<P>I have every thing to apprehend, Sir, re&s;umed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> tartly, while you per&s;i&s;t in your De|&s;ign
of di&s;obliging me; and you cannot give me
a greater Proof of the Badne&s;s of your Inten|tions,
than by thus forcing me to li&s;ten to Di&s;|cour&s;es
I ought to avoid.</P>
<P>Since my Word has no Weight with you,
replied Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I'll conde&s;cend to a&s;&s;ure you,
by the mo&s;t &s;acred Oath, That I do not mean
to come to any Extremities with Sir <HI>George,</HI>
concerning what you already told me: All I
de&s;ire to know is, If you think you had any Rea|&s;on
to be offended with him for any thing he
&s;aid? And, in that Ca&s;e, I cannot di&s;pen&s;e with
my&s;elf from expo&s;tulating with him about it.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="273">
You would do me a Favour, Sir, re&s;umed
<HI>Arabella,</HI> if you would intere&s;t your&s;elf a little
le&s;s in what Sir <HI>George</HI> &s;aid to me: The Of|fence
was committed again&s;t me only; and none
but my&s;elf has any Right to re&s;ent it.</P>
<P>'Tis enough, Niece, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> ri&s;ing:
You acknowlege &s;ufficient to make me re&s;olve
to oblige him to a&s;k Pardon for the Affront you
have received: However, I beg you may make
your&s;elf ea&s;y; no ill Con&s;equences will happen
from this Affair, provided my Son does not
know it: And I know you have too much Di&s;|cretion
to acquaint him with it.</P>
<P>Saying this, he went out of the Room, leav|ing
<HI>Arabella</HI> in great Con&s;u&s;ion at what he had
&s;aid; which, in her Opinion, had amounted
almo&s;t to a plain Declaration of his Pa&s;&s;ion; and
his De&s;ign of putting an End to Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
Preten&s;ions, whom, it was probable, he looked
upon as a more dangerous Rival than his Son,
confirmed her in the Opinion of his Re&s;olution
to per&s;ecute her.</P>
<P>Full of the Reflections this Accident had oc|ca&s;ioned,
&s;he went to walk in the Garden,
where Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> his Si&s;ter having ju&s;t left
him, joined her.</P>
<P>As he imagined, his Father's De&s;ign, in
&s;peaking to her alone, was to prevail upon her
to con&s;ent to marry him before &s;he left the Coun|try,
which was what he mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;hed,
he drew a bad Omen from the Di&s;content which
appeared in her Eyes.</P>
<P>Is it with me, Cou&s;in, &s;aid he, or with what
my Father has been &s;aying to you, that you are
angry?</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="274">
With both, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI> ha&s;tily; for if
you had &s;taid in the Room, as I commanded you,
I &s;hould not have been expo&s;ed to the Pain of
hearing Things &s;o di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Since I knew what would be the Purport of
my Father's Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> you
ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed I could not re&s;olve to
give any Interruption to it, by my Pre&s;ence:
And, being &s;o much intere&s;ted in the Succe&s;s
of his Solicitations, I could not choo&s;e but give
him an Opportunity of &s;peaking to you alone,
as he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>It &s;eems then, re&s;umed <HI>Arabella,</HI> you know
what was the Subject of his Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I believe I can gue&s;s, interrupted Mr. <HI>Glan|ville,</HI>
&s;miling.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;tarting back in
great Surprize, that, knowing, as you &s;ay you
do, your Father's Intentions, you would re|&s;olve
to furni&s;h him with an Opportunity of
di&s;clo&s;ing them?</P>
<P>Can you blame me, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> for
&s;uffering him to undertake what I dur&s;t not my|&s;elf?
I know your Delicacy, or rather your Se|verity,
&s;o well, that I am &s;en&s;ible, if I had
taken the Liberty to &s;ay what my Father has
&s;aid, you would have been extremely offended;
and puni&s;hed me, as you have often done, with
a Bani&s;hment from your Pre&s;ence: Nay, pur|&s;ued
he, &s;eeing A&s;toni&s;hment and Anger in her
Countenance, I perceive you are, at this Mo|ment,
going to pronounce &s;ome terrible Sen|tence
again&s;t me.</P>
<P>You are deceived, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> with a
forced Calmne&s;s; I am &s;o far from being of|fended
<PB N="261" REF="275">
with you, that I am ready to acknow|lege,
you merit very extraordinary Prai&s;es for
the perfect Re&s;ignation you &s;hew to the Will,
and, for your Credit, I will &s;uppo&s;e, the Com|mands,
of your Father: But I would advi&s;e you
to be contented with the Reputation of being a
dutiful Son; and, for the future, never a&s;pire
to that of being a faithful Lover.</P>
<P>Speaking the&s;e Words, which were wholly
unintelligible to her amazed Admirer, &s;he left
him, and went to her own Apartment, &s;trangely
&s;urpri&s;ed at the Indifference of Mr. <HI>Glanville;</HI>
who, as &s;he under&s;tood what he had &s;aid, was
not only willing to re&s;ign her to his Father,
but al&s;o took upon him to mediate in his be|half.</P>
<P>As &s;he was unwilling to acknowlege, even to
her&s;elf, that the Grief &s;he felt at this Di&s;covery,
proceeded from any Affection for her Cou&s;in,
&s;he imputed it to the Shame of &s;eeing her&s;elf &s;o
ba&s;ely for&s;aken and neglected; and, not being
able to find a Precedent for &s;uch an Indignity
offered to the Charms of any Lady in her Ro|mances,
the Singularity of her Fate, in this
re&s;pect, &s;eemed to demand all her Unea&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Which contains &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE <HI>Arabella</HI> pa&s;&s;ed her Time in
her Clo&s;et, in the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable
Reflections, <HI>Glanville</HI> was racking his Brain to
find out the Meaning of tho&s;e my&s;terious Words
&s;he had uttered at leaving him: He examined
them twenty times over, but could not po&s;&s;i|bly
penetrate into their Sen&s;e: But, &s;uppo&s;ing
at la&s;t, that they really meant nothing at all,
or were occa&s;ioned by &s;ome new Flight of her
Imagination, he went to find out his Father,
in order to know what had pa&s;&s;ed between
him and <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> however, was not to be found; he
had ordered his Hor&s;e to be made ready, under
Pretence of taking a little Ride after Dinner;
and, pa&s;&s;ing by Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Hou&s;e, alighted to
pay him a Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The young Baronet, being at home, received
him with great Politene&s;s: And Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
who&s;e peculiar Di&s;po&s;ition was, to be nicely te|nacious
of every thing which, he imagined,
had any Relation to the Honour of his Family,
took the fir&s;t Opportunity to que&s;tion him, con|cerning
the Confu&s;ion his Whi&s;per had occa|&s;ioned
in Lady <HI>Bella;</HI> adding, That &s;he had
confe&s;&s;ed, he had given her Rea&s;on to take ill
what he had &s;aid to her.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="277">
Sir <HI>George,</HI> who was by no means willing to
quarrel with the Uncle of <HI>Arabella,</HI> received the
old Gentleman's Remon&s;trances with a great
deal of Calmne&s;s; and, finding <HI>Arabella</HI> had
not di&s;covered the Purport of that Whi&s;per
which had offended her, he told Sir <HI>Charles,</HI>
That the Confu&s;ion he &s;aw in her Countenance,
was occa&s;ioned by his raillying her upon the
Fright &s;he had been in upon Mr. <HI>Glanville</HI>'s
Account: He added &s;ome Particulars to this
Account, that intirely taking away all Incli|nation
in Sir <HI>Charles</HI> to pur&s;ue the Matter any
farther, they parted upon very good Terms;
Sir <HI>George</HI> promi&s;ing, very &s;oon, to return his
Vi&s;it at the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> upon his Father's Return, be|ing
impatient to know what he had &s;aid to <HI>Ara|bella,</HI>
inquired with &s;o much Precipitation, con|cerning
the Conver&s;ation they had had together,
that Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> unwilling to tell him the Truth,
and not having time to con&s;ider of an An&s;wer,
evaded his Que&s;tion in &s;uch a manner, that Mr.
<HI>Glanville</HI> could not help making &s;ome Ob&s;er|vation
upon it; and, comparing this Circum|&s;tance
with what <HI>Arabella</HI> had &s;aid, tho' he
could not comprehend the Meaning that &s;eemed
to be concealed under their Behaviour, he im|mediately
concluded, there was &s;ome My&s;tery,
which it concerned him to find out.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this Opinion, he longed for
an Opportunity to talk with <HI>Arabella</HI> alone;
but he was not &s;o happy to obtain one; for,
tho' that Fair-one pre&s;ided at the Tea-table, as
u&s;ual, and al&s;o appeared at Supper, yet &s;he &s;o
indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided all Occa&s;ions of being alone
<PB N="264" REF="278">
with him, tho' but for a Moment, and ap|peared
&s;o re&s;erved and unea&s;y, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible
for him to &s;peak to her upon that Sub|ject.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was time to retire, having re|&s;olved
to reque&s;t the Favour of a few Moments
Conver&s;ation with her, in her own Apartment;
and when he had, as was his Cu&s;tom, handed
her up Stairs; in&s;tead of wi&s;hing her a good
Night, at her Chamber-door, he was going
to de&s;ire Permi&s;&s;ion to enter it with her; when
<HI>Lucy,</HI> coming to meet her Lady, whi&s;pered her
in the Ear; upon which, <HI>Arabella,</HI> turning
towards him, gave him an ha&s;ty Salute, and
hurried into her Apartment.</P>
<P><HI>Glanville,</HI> no le&s;s vexed at this Di&s;appoint|ment,
than perplexed at that Whi&s;per, which
had cau&s;ed &s;uch a vi&s;ible Emotion in <HI>Arabella,</HI>
retired to his own Room, tormented with a thou|&s;and
unea&s;y Su&s;picions, for which he could not
exactly a&s;&s;ign a Cau&s;e; and wi&s;hing impatiently
for the next Day, in which he hoped to pro|cure
&s;ome Explanation of what at pre&s;ent greatly
perplexed him.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Arabella,</HI> who had been
informed by <HI>Lucy,</HI> in that Whi&s;per, who was
eager to let her know it, that a Me&s;&s;enger had
brought a Letter from Sir <HI>George,</HI> and, late as
it was at Night, waited for an An&s;wer, was de|bating
with her&s;elf, whether &s;he &s;hould open
this Billet or not: She had a &s;trong Inclination
to &s;ee what it contained; but, fearful of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing
the Laws of Romance, by indulging a
Curio&s;ity not ju&s;tifiable by Example, &s;he re|&s;olved
to return this Letter unopened.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="279">
Here, &s;aid &s;he to <HI>Lucy,</HI> give this Letter to the
Me&s;&s;enger that brought it, and tell him, I was
exce&s;&s;ively offended with you, for receiving it
from his Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> taking the Letter, was going to obey
her Orders; when, recollecting her&s;elf, &s;he bid
her &s;tay.</P>
<P>Since Sir <HI>George,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, is no
declared Lover of mine, I may, without any
Offence to Decorum, &s;ee what this Letter con|tains:
To refu&s;e receiving it, will be to acknow|lege,
that his Sentiments are not unknown to
me; and, by con&s;equence, to lay my&s;elf under a
Nece&s;&s;ity of bani&s;hing him: Nor is it fit, that I
&s;hould allow him to believe, I am &s;o ready to
apprehend the Meaning of every gallant Speech,
which is u&s;ed to me; and to con&s;true &s;uch In|&s;inuations,
as he took the Liberty to make me,
into Declarations of Love.</P>
<P>Allowing, therefore, the Ju&s;tice of the&s;e Rea|&s;ons,
&s;he took the Letter out of <HI>Lucy</HI>'s Hand;
and, being upon the Point of opening it, a &s;ud|den
Thought controuled her De&s;igns: She threw
it &s;uddenly upon her Toilet; and, looking very

<P>Pre&s;umptuous Paper! &s;aid &s;he, &s;peaking with
great Emotion to the Letter: Bold Repo&s;itory

I have, that thou containe&s;t a Confe&s;|&s;ion
that will di&s;plea&s;e me, I open thy Seal,

Yet, to &s;pare my&s;elf the Trouble of reading

offend me, I have cho&s;en not to read it: And,
if he is wi&s;e, he will profit by my Concern for
him, and take care how he hazards di&s;plea&s;ing
me a Second time by an Importunity of this
kind, which I &s;hall not &s;o ea&s;ily pardon him.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> who had taken particular Notice of
this Speech, in order to remember every Word
<PB N="267" REF="281">
of it, when &s;he repeated it again, went conning
her Le&s;&s;on to the Place where &s;he had de&s;ired
the Servant to wait her coming: But he was
gone; &s;uch being indeed his Ma&s;ter's Orders;
for he was apprehen&s;ive, that, following the
Cu&s;tom of the Ladies in Romances, <HI>Arabella</HI>
would return his Letter; and therefore, to de|prive
her of an Opportunity of &s;ending it back
that Night, he ordered his Man to &s;ay, he
waited for an An&s;wer; but, as &s;oon as he con|veniently
could, to come away without one.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> in a great Surprize at the Servant's go|ing
away, returned to her Lady with the Letter
in her Hand, telling her &s;he mu&s;t needs read it
now, &s;ince the Per&s;on, who brought it, was
gone.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> taking
the Letter from her, with a Smile, he has fallen
upon an ingenious Device, to make me keep it
for this Night; and, &s;ince, haply, I may be
mi&s;taken in the Contents, I have a mind to
open it.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy</HI> did not fail to confirm her Lady in this
De&s;ign: And <HI>Arabella,</HI> making as if &s;he yielded
to the Importunities of her Confidante, opened
the Letter; which &s;he found as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>The unfortunate and de&s;pairing Bellmour, to
the Divine Arabella.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE it is, doubtle&s;s, not only with your
Permi&s;&s;ion, but even by your Commands,
that your Uncle, Sir <HI>Charles Glanville,</HI> comes
to pronounce the Sentence of my Death, in the
<PB N="268" REF="282">
Denunciation of your Anger, I &s;ubmit, Madam,
without repining at the Rigour of that Doom
you have inflicted on me. Yes, Madam, this
Criminal, who has dared to adore you, with
the mo&s;t &s;ublime and perfect Pa&s;&s;ion that ever
was, acknowleges the Ju&s;tice of his Puni&s;hment;
and, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible to cea&s;e loving you,
or to live without telling you he does &s;o, he is
going, voluntarily, to run upon that Death your
Severity makes him wi&s;h for, and the Great|ne&s;s
of his Crime demands. Let my Death
then, O Divine <HI>Arabella,</HI> expiate the Offence
I have been guilty of! And let me hope tho&s;e
fair Eyes, that have beheld me with Scorn
when alive, will not refu&s;e to &s;hed &s;ome Tears
upon my Tomb! And that, when you remem|ber
my Crime of loving you, you will al&s;o be
plea&s;ed to remember, that I died for that Crime;
and wi&s;h for no other Comfort in Death, but
the Hope of your not hating, when he is no
more,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>The unhappy <HI>Bellmour.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> who had read this Letter aloud,
&s;ighed gently at the Conclu&s;ion of it; but poor
<HI>Lucy,</HI> who was greatly affected at &s;o dolorous
an Epi&s;tle, could not re&s;train her Tears; but
&s;obbed &s;o often, and with &s;o much Violence,
as, at length, recalled her Lady from the Re|verie,
into which &s;he was plunged.</P>
<P>What ails you? &s;aid &s;he to her Confidante,
greatly &s;urpri&s;ed: What is the Cau&s;e of this un|&s;eemly
Sorrow?</P>
<P>Oh! Madam! cried <HI>Lucy,</HI> her Sobs making
a frequent and unplea&s;ing Interruption in her
<PB N="269" REF="283">
Words; I &s;hall break my Heart to be &s;ure: Ne|ver
was &s;uch a &s;ad mournful Letter in the
World: I could cry my Eyes out for the poor
Gentleman. Pray excu&s;e me, Madam; but,
indeed, I can't help &s;aying, You are the mo&s;t
hard-heartede&s;t Lady I ever knew in my born
Days: Why, to be &s;ure, you don't care, if
an hundred fine Gentlemen &s;hould die for you,
tho' their Spirits were to haunt you every Night!
Well! I would not have what your Lady&s;hip
has to an&s;wer for, for all the World!</P>
<P>You are a fooli&s;h Wench! replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
&s;miling at her Simplicity: Do you think I have
any Cau&s;e to accu&s;e my&s;elf, tho' Five thou&s;and
Men were to die for me? 'Tis very certain, my
Beauty has produced very deplorable Effects:
The unhappy <HI>Hervey</HI> has expiated, by his
Death, the Violence his too de&s;perate Pa&s;&s;ion
forced him to meditate again&s;t me: The no le&s;s
guilty, the noble Unknown, <HI>Edward,</HI> is wander|ing
about the World, in a tormenting De&s;pair;
and &s;tands expo&s;ed to the Vengeance of my
Cou&s;in, who has vowed his Death. My Charms
have made another Per&s;on, who&s;e Character
ought to be &s;acred to me, forget all the Ties
of Con&s;anguinity; and become the Rival of his
Son, who&s;e Intere&s;t he once endeavoured to
&s;upport: And, la&s;tly, the unfortunate <HI>Bell|mour</HI>
con&s;umes away in an hopele&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion;
and, con&s;cious of his Crime, dooms him&s;elf,
haply, with more Severity than I de&s;ire, to a
voluntary Death; in hopes, thereby, of pro|curing
my Pardon and Compa&s;&s;ion, when he is
no more. All the&s;e, <HI>Lucy,</HI> as I &s;aid before,
are very deplorable Effects of my Beauty; but
<PB N="270" REF="284">
you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that my Will has no Part
in the Mi&s;eries, that unfortunate Beauty occa|&s;ions;
and that, tho' I could even wi&s;h my&s;elf
le&s;s fair, in order to avoid giving &s;o much Un|happine&s;s
to others, yet the&s;e Wi&s;hes would
not avail; and &s;ince, by a fatal Nece&s;&s;ity, all
the&s;e Things will happen, whether I would or
no, I mu&s;t comfort my&s;elf under the Unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
which the Sen&s;ibility of my Temper
makes me feel, by the Reflection, that, with my
own Con&s;ent, I contribute nothing to the Mi&s;|fortune
of tho&s;e who love me.</P>
<P>Will your Lady&s;hip then let poor Sir <HI>George</HI>
die? &s;aid <HI>Lucy,</HI> who had li&s;tened very atten|tively
to this fine Harangue, without under|&s;tanding
what it meant.</P>
<P>Que&s;tionle&s;s, he mu&s;t die, replied <HI>Arabella,</HI>
if he per&s;i&s;ts in his De&s;ign of loving me.</P>
<P>But, pray, Madam, re&s;umed <HI>Lucy,</HI> cannot
your Lady&s;hip command him to live, as you
did Mr. <HI>Hervey,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Glanville,</HI> who both
did as you bid them?</P>
<P>I may command him to live, &s;aid <HI>Ara|bella;</HI>
and there is no Que&s;tion but he would
obey me, if I likewi&s;e permit him to love me;
but, this la&s;t not being fit for me to do, I &s;ee
no way to prevent the &s;ad Re&s;olution he has
taken.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Madam, returned <HI>Lucy,</HI> your
Lady&s;hip knows what you ought to do bet|ter
than I can advi&s;e your Lady&s;hip, being that
you are more learned than me: But, for all
that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> it's better to &s;ave Life than to kill,
as the Bible-Book &s;ays; and, &s;ince I am &s;ure
your Lady&s;hip is a good Chri&s;tian, if the Gen|tleman
<PB N="271" REF="285">
dies for the Want of a few kind Words,
or &s;o, I am &s;ure you will be troubled in Mind
about it.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;miling,
that, tho' your Solicitations are not very elo|quent,
they are very earne&s;t and affecting; and
I promi&s;e you, I will think about it; and, if I
can per&s;uade my&s;elf, I am doing no wrong
Thing, by concerning my&s;elf about his Pre&s;er|vation,
I will di&s;patch you To-morrow Morn|ing,
with my Orders to him, to live, or, at
lea&s;t, to proceed no further in his De&s;ign of dy|ing,
till he has further Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Lucy,</HI> being extremely glad &s;he had gained
her Point, called in her Lady's other Women,
who, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to undre&s;s, left her in
her Clo&s;et, to which &s;he always retired for an
Hour, before &s;he went to Bed.</P>
