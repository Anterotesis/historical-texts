<HEAD>AN
INVESTIGATION,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many cau&s;es that have been
a&s;&s;igned of the pre&s;ent high price of provi&s;ions,
I am much inclined to &s;u&s;pect, that the principal
one has hitherto e&s;caped detection; at lea&s;t, in
the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions on the &s;ubject, either in print or
conver&s;ation, which have fallen within my know|ledge,
the cau&s;e, which I conceive to have ope|rated
mo&s;t &s;trongly towards increa&s;ing the price
of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, has not yet been &s;ug|ge&s;ted.
There are &s;ome di&s;orders, which, though
they &s;carcely admit of a cure, or even of any
con&s;iderable mitigation, are &s;till capable of being
made greatly wor&s;e. In &s;uch misfortunes it is of
great importance to know the de&s;perate nature of
<PB N="2" REF="3">
the di&s;ea&s;e. The next &s;tep to the alleviation
of pain, is the bearing it with compo&s;ure, and
not aggravating it by impatience and irritation.</P>
<P>It cannot admit of a doubt with per&s;ons of
&s;en&s;e and information, that, during the la&s;t year,
there was a &s;carcity, to a certain extent, of all
&s;orts of grain; but it mu&s;t be at the &s;ame time ac|knowledged,
that the price was higher than the
degree of that &s;carcity would at fir&s;t &s;ight appear
to warrant.</P>
<P>In the Summer of 1799, in the cour&s;e of a
northern tour, I pa&s;&s;ed through Sweden. There
was at that time a general dearth of corn through|out
the country, owing to a long drought the
preceding year. In the province of Wurmland,
adjoining to Norway, it approached almo&s;t to a
famine, and the lower cla&s;&s;es of people &s;uffered
mo&s;t &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s. At the time we were pa&s;&s;ing
through that part of the country, which was in
July, they were reduced to two mo&s;t mi&s;erable
&s;ub&s;titutes for bread; one, made of the inner bark
of the fir, and the other, of the common &s;orrel
dried, and powdered. The&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, though
made into the u&s;ual &s;hape of their rye bread, had
no affinity to it whatever in ta&s;te, and but very
little, I believe, in nouri&s;hment, as the effects of
this mi&s;erable food were but too vi&s;ible in their
pallid and unhealthy countenances.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y">
There could be little doubt, that the degree of
&s;carcity then prevailing in that part of Sweden,
was con&s;iderably greater than any we have hitherto
experienced here; and yet, as far as we could learn,
the price of rye, which is the grain principally
u&s;ed for bread, had not ri&s;en above double its
u&s;ual average; whereas in this country la&s;t year,
in a &s;carcity, that mu&s;t be acknowledged to be
very greatly inferior in degree, wheat ro&s;e to
above three times its former price.</P>
<P>The continuation of extraordinary high prices,
after a harve&s;t that was at one time looked for|ward
to as abundant, has contributed &s;till more
to a&s;toni&s;h and perplex the public mind. Many
men of &s;en&s;e have joined in the univer&s;al cry of
the common people, that there mu&s;t be roguery
&s;omewhere; and the general indignation has fallen
upon monopolizers, fore&s;tallers, and regraters&mdash;words,
that are vented from every mouth with
fearful execrations, and are applied indi&s;crimi|nately
to all middle men whatever, to every kind
of trader that goes between the grower of the
commodity and the con&s;umer.</P>
<P>This popular clamour, headed by the Lord
Chief Ju&s;tice, and enforced throughout the coun|try
by the in&s;tructions of the grand juries, mu&s;t
make every reflecting mind tremble for the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
future &s;upply of our markets. I cannot but think,
therefore, that I &s;hould do an acceptable &s;ervice,
if I could &s;ucceed in accounting for the pre&s;ent
high price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, without cri|minating
a cla&s;s of men, who, I believe, have
been accu&s;ed unju&s;tly, and who, every political
economi&s;t mu&s;t know, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in
the complicated machinery that di&s;tributes the
provi&s;ions and other commodities of a large
nation.</P>
<P>I ought fir&s;t to premi&s;e, however, that I am
not intere&s;ted in this que&s;tion, further than as a
lover of truth, and a well-wi&s;her to my country.
I have no &s;ort of connection whatever with any
of the&s;e middle men or great farmers, who are
now the objects of public indignation: and, as an
individual with a &s;mall fixed income, I am cer|tainly
among that cla&s;s of per&s;ons on whom the
high price of provi&s;ions mu&s;t fall the heavie&s;t.</P>
<P>To proceed to the point: I am mo&s;t &s;trongly
inclined to &s;u&s;pect, that the attempt in mo&s;t parts
of the kingdom to increa&s;e the pari&s;h allowances
in proportion to the price of corn, combined with
the riches of the country, which have enabled it
to proceed as far as it has done in this attempt,
is, comparatively &s;peaking, the &s;ole cau&s;e, which
has occa&s;ioned the price of provi&s;ions in this
<PB N="5" REF="6">
country to ri&s;e &s;o much higher than the degree
of &s;carcity would &s;eem to warrant, &s;o much higher
than it would do in any other country where this
cau&s;e did not operate.</P>
<P>It may appear, perhaps, at fir&s;t, to the reader,
that this cau&s;e is inadequate to the effect we ex|perience;
but, if he will kindly allow me a few
minutes of patient and candid attention, I hope I
&s;hall be able to convince him, that it is not only
adequate to produce the pre&s;ent high price of
provi&s;ions of which we complain; but, admitting
a real &s;carcity, that the attempt to carry it actually
into execution, might rai&s;e the quartern loaf be|fore
the expiration of a year, to as many &s;hillings
as it is now pence.</P>
<P>Adam Smith has mo&s;t ju&s;tly &s;tated, that the
actual price at which a commodity is &s;old, is com|pounded
of its natural price, the price at which it
can be brought to market, allowing the u&s;ual
profit in times of moderate plenty, and the pro|portion
of the &s;upply to the demand. When any
commodity is &s;carce, its natural price is nece&s;&s;arily
forgotten, and its actual price is regulated by the
exce&s;s of the demand above the &s;upply.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e a commodity in great reque&s;t
by fifty people, but of which, from &s;ome failure
in its production, there is only &s;ufficient to &s;upply
forty. If the fortieth man from the top have two
<PB N="6" REF="7">
&s;hillings which he can &s;pend in this commodity,
and the thirty-nine above him, more, in various
proportions, and the ten below, all le&s;s, the ac|tual
price of the article, according to the genuine
principles of trade, will be two &s;hillings. If more
be a&s;ked, the whole will not be &s;old, becau&s;e there
are only forty who have as much as two &s;hillings
to &s;pend in the article; and there is no rea&s;on for
a&s;king le&s;s, becau&s;e the whole may be di&s;po&s;ed of
at that &s;um.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, now, that &s;omebody gives the
ten poor men, who were excluded, a &s;hilling a|piece.
The whole fifty can now offer two &s;hil|lings,
the price which was before a&s;ked. Ac|cording
to every genuine principle of fair trading,
the commodity mu&s;t immediately ri&s;e. If it do
not, I would a&s;k, upon what principle are ten, out
of the fifty who are all able to offer two &s;hillings,
to be rejected? For &s;till, according to the &s;uppo|&s;ition,
there is only enough for forty. The two
&s;hillings of a poor man are ju&s;t as good as the two
&s;hillings of a rich one; and, if we interfere to pre|vent
the commodity from ri&s;ing out of the reach
of the poore&s;t ten, whoever they may be, we mu&s;t
to&s;s up, draw lots, raffle, or flight, to determine
who are to be excluded. It would be beyond my
pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to enter into the que&s;tion whe|ther
<PB N="7" REF="8">
any of the&s;e modes would be more eligible,
for the di&s;tribution of the commodities of a
country, than the &s;ordid di&s;tinction of money;
but certainly, according to the cu&s;toms of all ci|vilized
and enlightened nations, and according to
every acknowledged principle of commercial
dealing, the price mu&s;t be allowed to ri&s;e to that
point which will put it beyond the power of ten
out of the fifty to purcha&s;e. This point will,
perhaps, be half-a-crown or more, which will
now become the price of the commodity. Let
another &s;hilling a-piece be given to the excluded
ten: all will now be able to offer half-a-crown.
The price mu&s;t in con&s;equence immediately ri&s;e
to three &s;hillings or more, and &s;o on <HI>toties quoties.</HI></P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of this operation the ten ex|cluded
would not be always entirely the &s;ame.
The riche&s;t of the ten fir&s;t excluded, would pro|bably
be rai&s;ed above the poore&s;t of the fir&s;t forty.
Small changes of this kind mu&s;t take place. The
additional allowances to the poore&s;t, and the
weight of the high prices on tho&s;e above them,
would tend to level the two orders; but, till a
complete level had taken place, ten mu&s;t be
always excluded, and the price would always be
fixed, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, at that &s;um which the
fortieth man at the top could afford to give. This,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
if the donatives were continued, would rai&s;e the
commodity to an extraordinary price, without
the &s;uppo&s;ition of any combination and con&s;piracy
among the venders, or any kind of unfair dealing
whatever.</P>
<P>The ri&s;e in the price of corn, and of other pro|vi&s;ions,
in this country, has been effected exactly
in the &s;ame manner, though the operation may be
a little more complicated; and I am firmly con|vinced,
that it never could have reached its pre|&s;ent
height, but from the &s;y&s;tem of poor laws and
pari&s;h allowances, which have operated preci&s;ely
in the &s;ame mode as the donatives of a &s;hilling
in the in&s;tance I have ju&s;t adduced.</P>
<P>The harve&s;t of 1799 was bad, both in quality
and quantity. Few people could deny that there
appeared to be a very con&s;iderable deficiency of
produce: and the price of the load of wheat ro&s;e
in con&s;equence almo&s;t immediately to &pound;. 20. I
returned from the North in the beginning of No|vember,
and found the alarm &s;o great and general,
and the price of corn &s;o high, that I remember
thinking that it was probably fully adequate to
the degree of the deficiency, and, taking into con|&s;ideration
the pro&s;pect of importation from the
very early alarm, that it would not ri&s;e much
higher during the year. In this conjecture, it
<PB N="9" REF="10">
appears that I was much mi&s;taken; but I have
very little doubt that in any other country equally
rich, yet without the &s;y&s;tem of poor laws and pa|ri&s;h
allowances, the price would never have ex|ceeded
&pound;.25 the load of wheat; and that this
&s;um would have been &s;ufficiently high to have
excluded &s;uch a number of people from their
u&s;ual con&s;umption, as to make the deficient crop,
with the quantity imported, la&s;t throughout the
year.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of poor laws, and pari&s;h allowances,
in this country, and I will add, to their honour,
the humanity and genero&s;ity of the higher and
middle cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, naturally and nece&s;&s;arily
altered this &s;tate of things. The poor com|plained
to the ju&s;tices that their wages would not
enable them to &s;upply their families in the &s;ingle
article of bread. The ju&s;tices very humanely,
and I am far from &s;aying improperly, li&s;tened to
their complaints, inquired what was the &s;malle&s;t
&s;um on which they could &s;upport their families,
at the then price of wheat, and gave an order of
relief on the pari&s;h accordingly. The poor were
now enabled, for a &s;hort time, to purcha&s;e nearly
their u&s;ual quantity of flour; but the &s;tock in the
country was not &s;ufficient, even with the pro&s;pect
of importation, to allow of the u&s;ual di&s;tribution
<PB N="10" REF="11">
to all its members. The crop was con&s;uming
too fa&s;t. Every market-day the demand exceeded
the &s;upply; and tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to
judge on the&s;e &s;ubjects, felt convinced, that in a
month or two the &s;carcity would be greater than
it was at that time. Tho&s;e who were able, there|fore,
kept back their corn. In &s;o doing, they
undoubtedly con&s;ulted their own intere&s;t; but
they, as undoubtedly, whether with the intention
or not is of no con&s;equence, con&s;ulted the true
intere&s;t of the &s;tate: for, if they had not kept it
back, too much would have been con&s;umed, and
there would have been a famine in&s;tead of a &s;car|city
at the end of the year.</P>
<P>The corn, therefore, naturally ro&s;e. The poor
were again di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Fre&s;h complaints were
made to the ju&s;tices, and a further relief granted;
but, like the water from the mouth of Tantalus, the
corn &s;till &s;lipped from the gra&s;p of the poor; and
ro&s;e again &s;o as to di&s;able them from purcha&s;ing
a &s;ufficiency to keep their families in health. The
alarm now became &s;till greater, and more ge|neral <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am de&s;cribing what took place in the neighbourhood where I then lived; and I have rea&s;on to believe that &s;ome|thing nearly &s;imilar took place in mo&s;t counties of the king|dom.</NOTE>. The ju&s;tices in their individual capa|cities
<PB N="11" REF="12">
were not thought competent to determine
on the proper modes of relief in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is,
a general meeting of the magi&s;trates was called,
aided by the united wi&s;dom of other gentlemen
of the county; but the re&s;ult was merely the con|tinuation
and exten&s;ion of the former &s;y&s;tem of
relief; and, to &s;ay the truth, I hardly &s;ee what el&s;e
could have been done. In &s;ome pari&s;hes this re|lief
was given in the &s;hape of flour; in others,
which was certainly better, in money, accompa|nied
with a recommendation not to &s;pend the
whole of it in wheaten bread, but to adopt &s;ome
other kind of food. All, however, went upon the
principle of inquiring what was the u&s;ual con|&s;umption
of flour in the different families, and of
enabling them to purcha&s;e nearly the &s;ame quan|tity
that they did before the &s;carcity. With this
additional command of money in the lower cla&s;&s;es,
and the con&s;equent increa&s;ed con&s;umption, the
number of purcha&s;ers at the then price would na|turally
exceed the &s;upply. The corn would in
con&s;equence continue ri&s;ing. The poor's rates in
many pari&s;hes increa&s;ed from four &s;hillings in the
pound to fourteen; the price of wheat nece&s;&s;arily
kept pace with them; and before the end of the
year was at near forty pounds a load; when pro|bably
<PB N="12" REF="13">
without the operation of this cau&s;e it would
not have exceeded twenty or twenty-five.</P>
<P>Some of the poor would naturally make u&s;e
of their additional command of money to pur|cha&s;e
butter, chee&s;e, bacon, pickled pork, rice,
potatoes, &amp;c. The&s;e commodities are all more
limited in quantity than corn; and would, there|fore,
more &s;uddenly feel the increa&s;ed demand.
If butter, chee&s;e, bacon, pickled pork, and the
coar&s;er parts of meat, had continued at their
u&s;ual price, they would have been purcha&s;ed by
&s;o many, to come in aid of an inferior kind of
bread, or to give a reli&s;h and additional nouri&s;h|ment
to their potatoes and rice, that the &s;upply
would not have been half adequate to the quan|tity
of the&s;e articles that was wanted. The&s;e
commodities, therefore, ro&s;e as naturally and as
nece&s;&s;arily as the corn; and, according to the ge|nuine
principles of fair trade, their price was
fixed at that &s;um which only &s;uch a number could
afford to give, as would enable the &s;upply to
an&s;wer the demand.</P>
<P>To fix upon this &s;um is the great object of
every dealer and &s;peculator <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> every commodity
whatever, and about which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t, of cour&s;e,
exerci&s;e his private judgment. A reflecting
<PB N="13" REF="14">
mind, far from being a&s;toni&s;hed that there are
now and then errors in &s;peculation, mu&s;t feel
much greater a&s;toni&s;hment that there are &s;o few;
and that the &s;upplies of a large nation, whether
plentiful or &s;canty, &s;hould be di&s;tributed &s;o
equally throughout the year. Mo&s;t happily for
&s;ociety, individual intere&s;t is, in the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;o
clo&s;ely and intimately interwoven with the public
intere&s;t, that one cannot gain or lo&s;e without a
gain or lo&s;s to the other. The man who refu&s;es
to &s;end his corn to market when it is at twenty
pounds a load, becau&s;e he thinks that in two
months time it will be at thirty, if he be right
in his judgment, and &s;ucceed in his &s;pecula|tion,
is a po&s;itive and decided benefactor to the
&s;tate; becau&s;e he keeps his &s;upply to that pe|riod
when the &s;tate is much more in want of
it; and if he and &s;ome others did not keep it
back in that manner, in&s;tead of its being thirty
in two months, it would be forty or fifty.</P>
<P>If he be wrong in his &s;peculation, he lo&s;es per|haps
very con&s;iderably him&s;elf, and the &s;tate
&s;uffers a little; becau&s;e, had he brought his corn
to market at twenty, the price would have fallen
&s;ooner, and the event &s;howed that there was
corn enough in the country to allow of it; but
the &s;light evil that the &s;tate &s;uffers in this ca&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="15">
is almo&s;t wholly compen&s;ated by the glut in the
market, when the corn is brought out, which
makes the price fall below what it would have
been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>I am far from &s;aying that there can be no
&s;uch thing as monopoly, and the other hard
words that have been &s;o much talked of. In a
commodity of a confined nature, within the
purcha&s;e of two or three large capitals, or of a
company of merchants, we all know that it has
often exi&s;ted; and, in a very few in&s;tances, the
article may have been in part de&s;troyed, to en|hance
the price, as the Dutch Company de|&s;troyed
the nutmeg-trees in their &s;pice i&s;lands:
but in an article which is in &s;o many hands as
corn is, in this country, monopoly, to any perni|cious
extent, may &s;afely be pronounced impo&s;|&s;ible.
Where are the capitals, or where is the
company of merchants, rich enough to buy
&s;uch a quantity of corn, as would make it an|&s;wer
to them to de&s;troy, or, which is the &s;ame
thing, not to &s;ell a great part of it? As they
could not, by the greate&s;t exertions, purcha&s;e
one fourth of all the corn in the country, it is
evident that, if any con&s;iderable part of their
&s;tock remained un&s;old, they would have enriched
all the other dealers in corn at their own expen&s;e;
<PB N="15" REF="16">
and would not have gained half &s;o much in pro|portion
to their capital as the re&s;t of the farmers
and cornfactors. If on the contrary all their
&s;tock &s;old, it would be a proof that the &s;pecula|tion
had been ju&s;t, and that the country had really
benefited by it.</P>
<P>It &s;eems now to be univer&s;ally agreed, that the
&s;tock of old corn remaining on hand at the begin|ning
of the harve&s;t this year was unu&s;ually &s;mall,
notwith&s;tanding that the harve&s;t came on nearly
a month &s;ooner than could have been expected
in the beginning of June. This is a clear, de|cided,
and unan&s;werable proof that there had
been no &s;peculations in corn that were preju|dicial
to the country. All that the large farmers
and cornfactors had done, was to rai&s;e the corn to
that price which excluded a &s;ufficient number
from their u&s;ual con&s;umption, to enable the
&s;upply to la&s;t throughout the year. This price,
however, has been mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially and powerfully
affected by the ability that has been given to the
labouring poor, by means of pari&s;h allowances,
of continuing to purcha&s;e wheat notwith&s;tanding
its extraordinary ri&s;e: and this ability mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
prevent the price of corn from falling very
materially, till there is an actual glut in the
market; for, while the whole &s;tock will go off at
<PB N="16" REF="17">
thirty pounds a load, it cannot, on any regular
principle of trade, &s;ink lower. I was in very
great hopes, ju&s;t before the harve&s;t, that &s;uch a
glut was about to take place; but it is now
to be feared, from the nature of the pre&s;ent crop,
that no &s;uch happy event can be hoped for during
the year.</P>
<P>I do not know whether I have convinced my
reader that the cau&s;e which I have a&s;&s;igned of the
pre&s;ent extraordinary price of provi&s;ions is ad|equate
to the effect; but I certainly feel mo&s;t
&s;trongly convinced of it my&s;elf; and I cannot
but believe that, if he differ from me, it can only
be in degree, and from thinking that the prin|ciple
of pari&s;h allowances has not yet been car|ried
far enough to produce any material effect.
With regard to the principle it&s;elf, if it were
really carried into execution, it appears to me
capable almo&s;t of mathematical demon&s;tration,
that, granting a real &s;carcity of one-fourth, which
could not be remedied by importation, it is ad|equate
to the effecting any height of price that
the proportion of the circulating medium to the
quantity of corn daily con&s;umed would admit.</P>
<P>It has often been propo&s;ed, and more than
once I believe, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, to
proportion the price of labour exactly to the
<PB N="17" REF="18">
price of provi&s;ions. This, though it would
be always a bad plan, might pa&s;s tolerably in
years of moderate plenty, or in a country that
was in the habit of a con&s;iderable exportation of
grain. But let us &s;ee what would be its ope|ration
in a real &s;carcity. We &s;uppo&s;e, for the &s;ake
of the argument, that by law every kind of labour
is to be paid accurately in proportion to the price
of corn, and that the rich are to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to
the utmo&s;t to &s;upport tho&s;e in the &s;ame manner
who are thrown out of employment, and fall
upon the pari&s;h. We allow the &s;carcity to
be an irremediable deficiency of one fourth of
all the provi&s;ions of the country. It is evi|dent
that, notwith&s;tanding this deficiency, there
would be no rea&s;on for economy in the labouring
cla&s;&s;es. The ri&s;e of their wages, or the pari&s;h
allowances that they would receive, would enable
them to purcha&s;e exactly the &s;ame quantity of
corn, or other provi&s;ions, that they did before,
whatever their price might be. The &s;ame quan|tity
would of cour&s;e be con&s;umed; and, accord|ing
to the regular principles of trade, as the &s;tock
continued dimini&s;hing, the price of all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of life would continue ri&s;ing, in the
mo&s;t rapid and unexampled manner. The mid|dle
cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety would very &s;oon be blended
<PB N="18" REF="19">
with the poor; and the large&s;t fortunes could
not long &s;tand again&s;t the accumulated pre&s;&s;ure
of the extraordinary price of provi&s;ions, on the
one hand, and the &s;till more extraordinary a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ments
for allowances to tho&s;e who had no other
means of &s;upport, on the other. The corn|factors
and farmers would undoubtedly be the
la&s;t that &s;uffered, but, at the expiration of the
three quarters of a year, what they received with
one hand, they mu&s;t give away with the other;
and a mo&s;t complete levelling of all property
would take place. All would have the &s;ame
quantity of money. All the provi&s;ions of the
country would be con&s;umed: and all the people
would &s;tarve together.</P>
<P>There is no kind of fear, that any &s;uch tra|gical
event &s;hould ever happen in any country;
but allowed my&s;elf to make the &s;uppo&s;ition;
becau&s;e, it appears to me, that, in the compli|cated
machinery of human &s;ociety, the effect
of any particular principle frequently e&s;capes
from the view, even of an attentive ob&s;erver, if
it be not magnified by pu&s;hing it to extremity.</P>
<P>I do not, however, by any means, intend to
infer, from what I have &s;aid, that the pari&s;h
allowances have been prejudicial to the &s;tate;
or that, as far as the &s;y&s;tem has been hitherto
<PB N="19" REF="20">
pur&s;ued, or is likely to be pur&s;ued, in this
country, that it is not one of the be&s;t modes of
relief that the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e will
admit. The &s;y&s;tem of the poor laws, in gene|neral,
I certainly do mo&s;t heartily condemn, as
I have expre&s;&s;ed in another place, but I am in|clined
to think that their operation in the pre|&s;ent
&s;carcity has been advantageous to the
country. The principal benefit which they have
produced, is exactly that which is mo&s;t bitterly
complained of&mdash;the high price of all the nece&s;|&s;aries
of life. The poor cry out loudly at
this price; but, in &s;o doing, they are very little
aware of what they are about; for it has un|doubtedly
been owing to this price that a much
greater number of them has not been &s;tarved.</P>
<P>It was calculated that there were only two-thirds
of an average crop la&s;t year. Probably,
even with the aid of all that we imported, the
deficiency &s;till remained a fifth or &s;ixth. Sup|po&s;ing
ten millions of people in the i&s;land;
the whole of this deficiency, had things been
left to their natural cour&s;e, would have fallen
almo&s;t exclu&s;ively on two, or perhaps three
millions of the poore&s;t inhabitants, a very con|&s;iderable
number of whom mu&s;t in con&s;equence
have &s;tarved. The operation of the pari&s;h al|lowances,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
by rai&s;ing the price of provi&s;ions &s;o
high, cau&s;ed the di&s;tre&s;s to be divided among
five or &s;ix millions, perhaps, in&s;tead of two or
three, and to be by no means unfelt even by the
remainder of the population.</P>
<P>The high price, therefore, which is &s;o much
complained of by the poor, has e&s;&s;entially mi|tigated
their di&s;tre&s;s by bringing down to their
level two or three millions more, and making
them almo&s;t equal &s;harers in the pre&s;&s;ure of the
&s;carcity.</P>
<P>The further effects of the high price have
been to enforce a &s;trict economy in all ranks of
life; to encourage an extraordinary importa|tion,
and to animate the farmer by the powerful
motive of &s;elf-intere&s;t to make every exertion
to obtain as great a crop as po&s;&s;ible the next
year.</P>
<P>If economy, importation, and every po&s;&s;ible
encouragement to future production, have not
the faire&s;t chance of putting an end to the &s;carcity,
I confe&s;s my&s;elf at a lo&s;s to &s;ay what better means
can be &s;ub&s;tituted. I may undoubtedly on this
&s;ubject be much mi&s;taken; but to me, I own,
they appear more calculated to an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e
intended, than the hanging any number of
farmers and cornfactors that could be named.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
No inference, therefore, is meant to be drawn
again&s;t what has been done for the relief of the
poor in the pre&s;ent &s;carcity, though it has with|out
doubt greatly rai&s;ed the price of provi&s;ions.
All that I contend for is, that we &s;hould be
aware of the effect of what we our&s;elves have
done, and not lay the blame on the wrong
per&s;ons.</P>
<P>If the cau&s;e, which I have detailed, be &s;uffi|cient
to account for the pre&s;ent high price of
provi&s;ions, without the &s;uppo&s;ition of any unfair
dealing among the farmers and cornfactors, we
ought &s;urely to bear the pre&s;ent pre&s;&s;ure like
men labouring under a di&s;order that mu&s;t have
its cour&s;e, and not throw ob&s;tacles in the way of
returning plenty, and endanger the future &s;upplies
of our markets, by encouraging the popular cla|mour,
and keeping the farmers and corn-dealers
in perpetual fear for their lives and property.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e that a year of &s;carcity can pa&s;s
without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;everely a large part of the in|habitants
of a country, is to &s;uppo&s;e a contra|diction
in the nature of things. I know of no
other definition of a &s;carcity than the failure of
the u&s;ual quantity of provi&s;ions; and if a great
part of the people had but ju&s;t enough before,
they mu&s;t undoubtedly have le&s;s than enough at
<PB N="22" REF="23">
&s;uch a period. With regard to the &s;carcity being
artificial, it appears to me &s;o impo&s;&s;ible, that,
till it has been proved that &s;ome man or &s;et of
men, with a capital of twenty or thirty millions
&s;terling, has bought up half the corn in the
country, I own I mu&s;t &s;till di&s;believe it. On
this &s;ubject, however, I know that I differ from
&s;ome very re&s;pectable friends of mine, among
the common people, who &s;ay that it is quite im|po&s;&s;ible
that there can be a real &s;carcity, becau&s;e
you may get what quantity of corn you plea&s;e,
if you have but money enough; and to &s;ay the
truth, many per&s;ons, who ought to be better in|formed,
argue exactly in the &s;ame way. I have
often talked with labouring men on this &s;ubject,
and endeavoured to &s;how them, that if they,
or I, had a great deal of money, and other peo|ple
had but little, we could undoubtedly buy
what quantity of corn we liked, by taking away
the &s;hares of tho&s;e who were le&s;s rich; but that
if all the people had the &s;ame &s;um, and that there
was not enough corn in the country to &s;upply all,
we could not get what we wanted for money,
though we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed millions. I never found,
however, that my rhetoric produced much im|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The cry at pre&s;ent is in favour of &s;mall farms,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
and again&s;t middle men. No two clamours can
well be more incon&s;i&s;tent with each other, as the
de&s;truction of the middle men would, I conceive,
nece&s;&s;arily involve with it the de&s;truction of &s;mall
farmers. The &s;mall farmer requires a quick re|turn
of his &s;canty capital to enable him to pay
his rent and his workmen; and mu&s;t therefore
&s;end his corn to market almo&s;t immediately after
harve&s;t. If he were required to perform the
office of corn-dealer, as well as farmer, and wait
to regulate his &s;upplies to the demands of the
markets, a double capital would be ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to him, and not having that, he would
be ruined.</P>
<P>Many men of &s;en&s;e and information have at|tributed
the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions to the quan|tity
of paper in circulation. There was un|doubtedly
great rea&s;on for apprehen&s;ion, that
when, by the &s;toppage of the Bank to pay in
&s;pecie, the emi&s;&s;ion of paper cea&s;ed to have its
natural check, the circulation would be over|loaded
with this currency; but this certainly
could not have taken place to any con&s;iderable
extent without a &s;en&s;ible depreciation of bank
notes in compari&s;on with &s;pecie. As this depre|ciation
did not happen, the progre&s;s of the evil
mu&s;t have been &s;low and gradual, and never
<PB N="24" REF="25">
could have produced the &s;udden and extraor|dinary
ri&s;e in the price of provi&s;ions which was
&s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt la&s;t year, after a &s;ea&s;on of mode|rate
cheapne&s;s, &s;ub&s;equent to the &s;toppage of the
Bank.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance, however, that
ought to be attended to. To circulate the &s;ame,
or nearly the &s;ame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a &s;carcity the quantity of commodities in circulation is probably not &s;o great as in years of plenty.</NOTE>, quantity of commodities
through a country, when they bear a much
higher price, mu&s;t require a greater quantity of
the medium, whatever that may be. The cir|culation
naturally takes up more. It is pro|bable,
therefore, that the Bank has found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to i&s;&s;ue a greater number of its notes on
this account. Or, if it has not, this deficiency
has been &s;upplied by the country bankers, who
have found that their notes now &s;tay out longer,
and in greater quantity, than they did before the
&s;carcity, which may tempt many to overtrade
their capitals. If the quantity of paper, there|fore,
in circulation has greatly increa&s;ed during
the la&s;t year, I &s;hould be inclined to con&s;ider it
rather as the effect than the cau&s;e of the high
price of provi&s;ions. This &s;ulne&s;s of circulating
<PB N="25" REF="26">
medium, however, will be one of the ob&s;tacles
in the way to returning cheapne&s;s.</P>
<P>The public attention is now fixed with anxiety
towards the meeting of Parliament, which is to
relieve us from our pre&s;ent difficulties; but the
more con&s;iderate do not feel very &s;anguine on
this &s;ubject, knowing how little is to be done
in this &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s by legi&s;lative inter|ference.
We interfere to fix the a&s;&s;ize of bread.
Perhaps one of the be&s;t interferences of the
Legi&s;lature, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, would be
to aboli&s;h that a&s;&s;ize. I have certainly no ten|dency
to believe in combinations and con&s;pi|racies;
but the great interval that elap&s;es be|tween
the fall of wheat and the fall of flour,
compared with the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the ri&s;e
of flour to the ri&s;e of wheat, would almo&s;t tempt
one to &s;uppo&s;e, that there might be &s;ome little
management in the return of the meal weighers
to the Lord Mayor. If the public &s;uffer in this
in&s;tance, it is evidently owing to the a&s;&s;ize,
without which, the opportunity of any &s;uch ma|nagement
would not exi&s;t. And what occa&s;ion
can there be for an a&s;&s;ize in a city like London,
in which there are &s;o many bakers? If &s;uch a re|gulation
were ever nece&s;&s;ary, it would appear to
be mo&s;t &s;o in a country village or &s;mall town,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
where perhaps there is but one per&s;on in the
trade, and who might, therefore, for a time, have
an opportunity of impo&s;ing on his cu&s;tomers;
but this could not take place where there was
&s;uch room for competition as in London. If
there were no a&s;&s;ize, more attention would be
con&s;tantly paid to the weight and quality of the
bread bought; and the bakers who &s;old the be&s;t
in the&s;e two re&s;pects would have the mo&s;t cu&s;|tom.
The removal of this regulation would
remove, in a great mea&s;ure, the difficulty about
brown bread, and a much greater quantity of it
would probably be con&s;umed.</P>
<P>The &s;oup-&s;hops, and every attempt to make
a nouri&s;hing and palatable food of what was be|fore
not in u&s;e among the common people, mu&s;t
evidently be of great &s;ervice in the pre&s;ent di&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>It is a fact now generally acknowledged, and
it has lately received an official &s;anction in a
letter of the Duke of portland to the Lord
Lieutenant of the county of Oxford, that of late
years, even in the be&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, we have not
grown corn &s;ufficient for our own con&s;umption;
whereas, twenty years ago, we were in the con|&s;tant
habit of exporting grain to a very con&s;ider|able
amount. Though we may &s;uppo&s;e that
<PB N="27" REF="28">
the agriculture of the country has not been in|crea&s;ing,
as it ought to have done, during this
period; yet we cannot well imagine that it has
gone backwards. To what then can we attri|bute
the pre&s;ent inability in the country to &s;up|port
its inhabitants, but to the increa&s;e of po|pulation?
I own that I cannot but con&s;ider
the late &s;evere pre&s;&s;ures of di&s;tre&s;s on every de|ficiency
in our crops, as a very &s;trong exem|plification
of a principle which I endeavoured to
explain in an e&s;&s;ay publi&s;hed about two years
ago, entitled, <HI>An E&s;&s;ay on the Principle of
Population, as it affects the future Improve|ment
of Society.</HI> It was con&s;idered by many
who read it, merely as a &s;pecious argument, in|applicable
to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety; be|cau&s;e
it contradicted &s;ome preconceived opi|nions
on the&s;e &s;ubjects. Two years reflection
have, however, &s;erved &s;trongly to convince
me of the truth of the principle there advanced,
and of its being the real cau&s;e of the continued
depre&s;&s;ion and poverty of the lower cla&s;&s;es of
&s;ociety, of the total inadequacy of all the pre|&s;ent
e&s;tabli&s;hments in their favour to relieve
them, and of the periodical returns of &s;uch
&s;ea&s;ons of di&s;tre&s;s as we have of late experi|enced.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
The e&s;&s;ay has now been out of print above a
year; but I have deferred giving another edi|tion
of it in the hope of being able to make it
more worthy of the public attention, by apply|ing
the principle directly and exclu&s;ively to the
exi&s;ting &s;tate of &s;ociety, and endeavouring to
illu&s;trate the power and univer&s;ality of its opera|tion
from the be&s;t authenticated accounts that we
have of the &s;tate of other countries. Particular
engagements in the former part of the time, and
&s;ome mo&s;t unfore&s;een and unfortunate inter|ruptions
latterly, have hitherto prevented me
from turning my attention, with any effect,
towards this &s;ubject. I &s;till, however, have it
in view. In the mean time I hope that this
ha&s;ty attempt to add my mite to the public &s;tock
of information, in the pre&s;ent emergency, will be
received with candour.</P>
