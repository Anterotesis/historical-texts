<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>2 PET. iii. 15, 16.</BIBL>
<Q>EVEN AS OUR BELOVED BROTHER PAUL ALSO, ACCORD|ING
TO THE WISDOM GIVEN UNTO HIM, HATH WRIT|TEN
UNTO YOU; AS ALSO IN ALL HIS EPISTLES
SPEAKING IN THEM OF THOSE THINGS; IN WHICH
ARE SOME THINGS HARD TO BE UNDERSTOOD, WHICH
THEY THAT ARE UNLEARNED, AND UNSTABLE,
WREST, AS THEY DO ALSO THE OTHER SCRIPTURES,
UNTO THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled that there are many real diffi|culties
in the Chri&s;tian &s;criptures; whil&s;t at the &s;ame time
more, I believe, and greater may ju&s;tly be imputed to certain
maxims of interpretation, which have obtained authority
without rea&s;on, and are received without enquiry.&mdash;One of
the&s;e, as I apprehend, is the expecting to find in the pre&s;ent
circum&s;tances of chri&s;tianity, a meaning for, or &s;omething
an&s;wering to, every appellation and expre&s;&s;ion which occurs
in &s;cripture; or in other words, the applying to the per&s;onal
condition of Chri&s;tians at this day, tho&s;e titles, phra&s;es, pro|po&s;itions
and arguments, which belong &s;olely to the &s;ituation
of chri&s;tianity at its fir&s;t in&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
I am aware of an objection which weighs much with many
&s;erious tempers, namely, that to &s;uppo&s;e any part of &s;cripture
to be inapplicable to us, is to &s;uppo&s;e a part of &s;cripture to be
u&s;ele&s;s; which &s;eems to detract from the perfection we attri|bute
to the&s;e oracles of our &s;alvation.&mdash;To this I can only an|&s;wer,
that it would have been one of the &s;trange&s;t things in
the world, if the writings of the new te&s;tament had not, like
all other books, been compo&s;ed for the apprehen&s;ion, and
con&s;equently adapted to the circum&s;tances, of the per&s;ons they
were addre&s;&s;ed to; and that it would have been equally &s;trange,
if the great, and in many re&s;pects the inevitable, alterations,
which have taken place in tho&s;e circum&s;tances, did not vary
the application of &s;cripture language.</P>
<P>I de&s;ign in the following di&s;cour&s;e to propo&s;e &s;ome examples
of this variation, from which you will judge, as I proceed, of
the truth and importance of our general ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>1. At the time the &s;criptures were written, none were <HI>bap|tized</HI>
but converts, and none were converted but from con|viction,
and conviction produced for the mo&s;t part a cor|re&s;ponding
reformation of life and manners.&mdash;Hence <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI>
was only another name for conver&s;ion, and conver&s;ion was
&s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;incere&mdash;in this &s;en&s;e was our Savior's promi&s;e,
"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 16.</NOTE> he that believeth and is <HI>baptized</HI> &s;hall be &s;aved," and in the
&s;ame his command to St. Paul "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Acts xxii. 16.</NOTE> ari&s;e and be <HI>baptized</HI> and
wa&s;h away thy &s;ins;" this was that <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> "for the remi&s;&s;ion
of &s;ins," to which St. Peter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Acts ii, 38,</NOTE> invited the Jews upon the day of
Penteco&s;t; that "<HI>wa&s;hing</HI> of regeneration" by which as St. Paul<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Titus iii. 5.</NOTE> writes to Titus "he &s;aved us." Now when we come
to &s;peak of the <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> which obtains in mo&s;t chri&s;tian
churches at pre&s;ent, where no conver&s;ion is &s;uppo&s;ed, or
<PB N="3" REF="5">
po&s;&s;ible; it is manife&s;t, that if the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions be applied at
all, they mu&s;t be applied with extreme qualification and
re&s;erve.</P>
<P>2. The community of chri&s;tians were at fir&s;t a handful of
men connected among&s;t them&s;elves by the &s;tricte&s;t union, and
divided from the re&s;t of the world by a real difference of prin|ciple
and per&s;ua&s;ion, and what was more ob&s;ervable, by many
outward peculiarities of wor&s;hip and behavior.&mdash;This
&s;ociety con&s;idered collectively, and as a <HI>body,</HI> were &s;et apart
from the re&s;t of mankind for a more gracious di&s;pen&s;ation, as
well as actually di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;uperior purity of life and
conver&s;ation.&mdash;In this view, and in oppo&s;ition to the unbe|lieving
world, they were denominated in &s;cripture by titles of
great &s;eeming dignity and import&mdash;they were "<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 33. i. 6, 7.</NOTE> elect,"
"called," "faints"&mdash;they were "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">viii. 1.</NOTE> in Chri&s;t"&mdash;they were
"<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 9.</NOTE> a cho&s;en generation, a royal prie&s;thood, a holy nation, a
"peculiar people."&mdash;That is, the&s;e terms were employed to
di&s;tingui&s;h the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity from the re&s;t of man|kind,
in the &s;ame manner as the names of Greek and Barba|rian,
Jew and Gentile, di&s;tingui&s;hed the people of Greece and
I&s;rael from other nations. The application of &s;uch phra&s;es
to the whole <HI>body</HI> of chri&s;tians is become now ob&s;cure; partly,
becau&s;e it is not ea&s;y to conceive of chri&s;tians as a <HI>body</HI> at all,
by rea&s;on of the extent of their name and numbers, and the
little vi&s;ible union that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among them; and partly, be|cau&s;e
the heathen world with whom they were compared, and
to which compari&s;on the&s;e phra&s;es relate, is now cea&s;ed, or is
removed from our ob&s;ervation.&mdash;Suppo&s;ing therefore the&s;e
expre&s;&s;ions to have a perpetual meaning, and either forgetting
the original u&s;e of them, or finding <HI>that,</HI> at this time, in a
<PB N="4" REF="6">
great mea&s;ure exhau&s;ted and in&s;ignificant, we re&s;ort to a &s;en&s;e
and an application of them, ea&s;ier it may be to our compre|hen&s;ion,
but extremely foreign from the de&s;ign of their au|thors,
namely, to di&s;tingui&s;h individuals among&s;t us, the pro|fe&s;&s;ors
of Chri&s;tianity from one another&mdash;agreeably to which
Idea the mo&s;t flattering of the&s;e names, the "elect," "called,"
"&s;aints," have by bold and unlearned men been appropriated
to them&s;elves and their own party with a pre&s;umption and
conceit, injurious to the reputation of our religion among&s;t
"them that are without," and extremely di&s;gu&s;ting to the &s;o|ber
part of its profe&s;&s;ors: whereas, that &s;uch titles were in|tended
in a &s;en&s;e common to all chri&s;tian converts is well
argued from many places in which they occur, in which places
you may plainly &s;ub&s;titute the terms <HI>convert</HI> or <HI>converted</HI> for
the &s;tronge&s;t of the&s;e phra&s;es without any alteration of the
author's meaning, e. g. "<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi. 1.</NOTE> dare any of you go to Law before
the unju&s;t and not before the &s;aints?" "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">vii. 18.</NOTE> is any man <HI>called</HI> be|ing
circumci&s;ed, let him not become uncircumci&s;ed?"&mdash;"<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 13.</NOTE> the
church that is at Babylon <HI>elected</HI> together with you &s;aluteth
you"&mdash;"<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rom. xvi. 7.</NOTE> &s;alute Andronicus and Junia who were <HI>in Chri&s;t</HI>
before me."</P>
<P>3. In oppo&s;ition to the Jews who were &s;o much offended
by the preaching of the Go&s;pel to the Gentiles, St. Paul main|tains
with great indu&s;try, that it was God Almighty's inten|tion
from <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> to &s;ub&s;titute at a fit &s;ea&s;on into the place of
the rejected I&s;raelites a &s;ociety of men, taken indifferently out
of all nations under heaven, and admitted to be the people of
God upon ea&s;ier and more comprehen&s;ive terms&mdash;this is ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in the Epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians, as follows;"<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 9, 10. al&s;o &s;ee Eph. iii. 5, 6.</NOTE> having
<PB N="5" REF="7">
made known to us the my&s;tery of his will, according to his
good plea&s;ure which he hath <HI>purpo&s;ed in him&s;elf,</HI> that in the
di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together
in one all things in Chri&s;t."&mdash;The &s;cheme of collecting &s;uch
a &s;ociety was what God <HI>foreknow</HI> before the foundation of the
world; was what he did <HI>prede&s;tinate;</HI> was the <HI>eternal purpo&s;e</HI>
which he purpo&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: and by con&s;equence this
&s;ociety in their collective capacity were the objects of this <HI>fore|knowledge,
prede&s;tination,</HI> and <HI>purpo&s;e;</HI> that is, in the language
of the apo&s;tles, they were they "<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom, viii. 29.</NOTE> whom he did <HI>foreknow,</HI>" they
"whom he did <HI>prede&s;tinate</HI>"&mdash;they were "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph, i. 4.</NOTE> <HI>cho&s;en in Chri&s;t</HI>
before the foundation of the world"&mdash;they were "<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i, 2.</NOTE> <HI>elect</HI>
according to the <HI>foreknowledge</HI> of God the Father." This doc|trine
has nothing in it har&s;h or ob&s;cure.&mdash;But what have we
made of it?&mdash;The rejection of the Jews, and the adopting an|other
community into their place, compo&s;ed, whil&s;t it was
carrying on, an object of great magnitude in the attention of
the in&s;pired writers who under&s;tood and ob&s;erved it.&mdash;This
event, which engaged &s;o much the thoughts of the Apo&s;tle, is
now only read of, and hardly that&mdash;the reality and the import|ance
of it are little known or attended to.&mdash;Lo&s;ing &s;ight there|fore
of the proper occa&s;ion of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, yet willing
after our fa&s;hion to adapt them to our&s;elves, and finding no|thing
el&s;e in our circum&s;tances that &s;uited with them, we have
learnt at length to apply them to the final de&s;tiny of indivi|duals
at the day of judgement; and upon this foundation has
been erected a doctrine which lays the ax at once to the root
of all religion, that of an ab&s;olute appointment to &s;alvation or
perdition, independent of our&s;elves or any thing we can do:
and, what is extraordinary, tho&s;e very arguments and ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
(Rom. Chap. ix. x. xi.) which the Apo&s;tle employed
to vindicate the impartial mercies of God, again&s;t the narrow
and excluding claims of Jewi&s;h prejudice, have been inter|preted
to e&s;tabli&s;h a di&s;pen&s;ation the mo&s;t arbitrary and par|tial
that could be devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>4. The conver&s;ion of a grown per&s;on from heatheni&s;m to
chri&s;tianity, which is the ca&s;e of conver&s;ion commonly in|tended
in the epi&s;tles, was a change of which we have now no
ju&s;t conception&mdash;it was a new name, a new language, a new
&s;ociety; a new faith, a new hope; a new object of wor&s;hip,
a new rule of life; a hi&s;tory was di&s;clo&s;ed full of di&s;covery and
&s;urpri&s;e; a pro&s;pect of futurity was unfolded, beyond imagi|nation
awful and augu&s;t; the &s;ame de&s;cription applies in a
great part though not entirely to the conver&s;ion of a Jew.&mdash;
This, accompanied as it was with the pardon of every former
&s;in, (Romans iii. 25.) was &s;uch an aera in a man's life, &s;o
remarkable a period in his recollection, &s;uch a revolution of
every thing that was mo&s;t important to him, as might well
admit of tho&s;e &s;trong figures and &s;ignificant allu&s;ions by which
it is de&s;cribed in &s;cripture&mdash;it was a "<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>regeneration,</HI>" or a
new birth&mdash;it was to be "<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John i. 13. iii. 5.</NOTE> born again of God and of the
&s;pirit"&mdash;it was to be "<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 2, 13.</NOTE> dead to &s;in," and" alive from the
dead"&mdash;it was to be "<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 12.</NOTE> buried with Chri&s;t in bapti&s;m, and
rai&s;ed together with him"&mdash;it was "<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 17.</NOTE> a new creature" and
"<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 24.</NOTE> a new creation"&mdash;it was a tran&s;lation from the condition
of "<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 7.</NOTE> &s;laves to that of &s;ons"&mdash;from "<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii, 19.</NOTE> &s;trangers and foreign|ers
to be fellow citizens with the &s;aints and of the hou&s;hold of
God." It is manife&s;t that no change equal or &s;imilar to the
conver&s;ion of a heathen can be experienced by us, or by any
<PB N="7" REF="9">
one educated in a chri&s;tian country, and to whom the facts,
precepts and hopes of chri&s;tianity have been from his infancy
familiar&mdash;yet we will retain the &s;ame language&mdash;and what
has been the con&s;equence? One &s;ort of men, ob&s;erving nothing
in the lives of chri&s;tians, corre&s;ponding to the magnificence,
if I may &s;o &s;ay, of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, have been tempted to
conclude, that the expre&s;&s;ions them&s;elves had no foundation
in truth and nature, or in any thing but the enthu&s;ia&s;m of
their authors.&mdash;Others again under&s;tand the&s;e phra&s;es to &s;ig|nify
nothing more, than that gradual amendment of life and
conver&s;ation, which rea&s;on and religion &s;ometimes produce in
particular chri&s;tians&mdash;of which interpretation it is truly &s;aid,
that it degrades too much the proper force of language, to ap|ply
expre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch energy and import to an event, &s;o or|dinary
in its own nature, and which is common to chri&s;tianity
with every other moral in&s;titution. La&s;tly, a third &s;ort, in
order to &s;atisfy the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions to their full extent, have
imagined to them&s;elves certain perceptible impul&s;es of the
Holy Gho&s;t, by which, in an in&s;tant, and in a manner, no
doubt, &s;ufficiently extraordinary, they are "<HI>regenerate</HI> and <HI>born
of the &s;pirit</HI>"&mdash;they become "<HI>new creatures</HI>"&mdash;they are made
the "<HI>&s;ons of God</HI>" who were before the "<HI>children of wrath</HI>"&mdash;
they are "<HI>freed,</HI> from &s;in," and "from death"&mdash;they are
cho&s;en, that is, and &s;ealed, without a po&s;&s;ibility of fall, unto
final &s;alvation.&mdash;Whil&s;t the patrons of a more &s;ober expo|&s;ition
have been often challenged, and &s;ometimes confounded
with the que&s;tion&mdash;if &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of &s;cripture do not
mean <HI>this,</HI> what do they mean? To which we an&s;wer&mdash;no|thing
&mdash;nothing, that is, to us&mdash;nothing to be found, or
&s;ought for, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
More examples might be produced, in which the unwary
u&s;e of &s;cripture language has been the occa&s;ion of difficulties
and mi&s;takes&mdash;but I forbear&mdash;the pre&s;ent are &s;ufficient to
&s;how, that it behoves every one, who undertakes to explain
the &s;criptures, before he determine to whom or what an ex|pre&s;&s;ion
is now a days to be applied, to con&s;ider diligently
whether it admit of any &s;uch application at all; or whether
it is not rather to be re&s;trained to the preci&s;e circum&s;tances
and occa&s;ion for which it was originally compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I make no apology for addre&s;&s;ing this &s;ubject to this audi|ence;
becau&s;e whatever relates to the interpretation of &s;crip|ture,
relates, as I conceive, to us; for, if, by any light we may
ca&s;t upon the&s;e ancient books, we can enable and invite the
people to read the Bible for them&s;elves, we di&s;charge in my
judgement the fir&s;t duty of our function&mdash;ever bearing in
mind that we are the mini&s;ters not of our own &s;ame or fan|cies,
but of the &s;incere Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
