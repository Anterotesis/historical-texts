<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Painters in the Reign of Charles II.</HEAD>
<P>THE arts were in a manner expelled with the Royal Family
from Britain. The anecdotes of a Civil War are the hi&s;tory
of De&s;truction. In all ages the mob have vented their hatred
to Tyrants, on the pomp of Tyranny. The magnificence the people
have envied, they grow to dete&s;t, and mi&s;taking con&s;equences for
cau&s;es, the fir&s;t objects of their fury are the palaces of their ma&s;ters.
If Religion is thrown into the quarrel, the mo&s;t innocent arts are cata|logued
with &s;ins. This was the ca&s;e in the conte&s;ts between Charles
and his parliament. As he had blended affection to the &s;ciences with
a lu&s;t of power, non&s;en&s;e and ignorance were adopted into the liber|ties
of the &s;ubject. Painting became idolatry; monuments were
deemed carnal pride, and a venerable cathedral &s;eemed equally contra|dictory
to Magna Charta and the Bible. Learning and wit were con|&s;trued
to be &s;o heathen, that one would have thought the Holy Gho&s;t
could endure nothing above a pun. What the fury of Henry VIII.
had &s;pared, was condemned by the Puritans: Ruin was their harve&s;t,
and they gleaned after the Reformers. Had they countenanced any
of the &s;ofter arts, what could tho&s;e arts have repre&s;ented? How pictu|re&s;que
<PB N="2" REF="3">
was the figure of an Anabapti&s;t? But &s;ectaries have no o&s;ten|&s;ible
enjoyments; their plea&s;ures are private, comfortable and gro&s;s.
The arts that civilize &s;ociety are not calculated for men who mean to
ri&s;e on the ruins of e&s;tabli&s;hed order. Jargon and au&s;terities are the
weapons that be&s;t &s;erve the purpo&s;es of here&s;iarcs and innovators. The
&s;ciences have been excommunicated from the Gno&s;tics to Mr.
Whitfield.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of royalty brought back the arts, not ta&s;te. Charles
II. had a turn to mechanics, none to the politer &s;ciences. He had
learned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See before, vol. ii. p. 109.</NOTE> to draw in his youth; in the imperial library at Vienna is
a view of the i&s;le of Jer&s;ey, de&s;igned by him; but he was too indo|lent
even to amu&s;e him&s;elf. He introduced the fa&s;hions of the court
of France, without it's elegance. He had &s;een Louis XIV. counte|nance
Corneille, Moliere, Boileau, Le Sueur, who forming them&s;elves
on the models of the ancients, &s;eemed by the purity of their writings
to have &s;tudied only in <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It has been objected by &s;ome per&s;ons that the expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>&s;tudying in Sparta</HI> is improper, as the Spartans were an illiterate people and produced no authors. A Critici&s;m I think very ill-founded. The purity of the French writers, not their learning, is the object of the text. Many men travelled to La|cedaemon to &s;tudy the laws and in&s;titutions of Lycurgus. Men vi&s;it all countries, under the pretence at lea&s;t of &s;tudying the re&s;pective manners: nor have I ever heard before that the term <HI>&s;tudying</HI> was re&s;tricted to meer reading. When I &s;ay an author wrote as cha&s;tly as if he had &s;tudied only in Sparta, is it not evident that I meaned his morals, not his information, were formed on the pure&s;t models?</NOTE> Sparta. Charles found as much genius at
home, but how licentious, how indelicate was the &s;tyle he permitted or
demanded! Dryden's tragedies, are a compound of bomba&s;t and he|roic
ob&s;cenity, inclo&s;ed in the mo&s;t beautiful numbers. If Wycherley
<PB N="3" REF="4">
had nature, it is nature &s;tark naked. The painters of that time veiled
it but little more; Sir Peter Lely &s;carce &s;aves appearances but by a bit
of fringe or embroidery. His nymphs, generally repo&s;ed on the turf,
are too wanton and too magnificent to be taken for any thing but
maids of honour. Yet fanta&s;tic as his compo&s;itions &s;eem, they were
pretty much in the dre&s;s of the times, as is evident by a puritan tract
publi&s;hed in 1678, and intituled, "Ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Reprehen|&s;ions
of naked Brea&s;ts and Shoulders." The court had gone a good
way beyond the fa&s;hion of the preceding reign, when the galantry in
vogue was to wear a lock of &s;ome favorite object; and yet Prynne had
thought that mode &s;o damnable, that he publi&s;hed an ab&s;urd piece
again&s;t it, called, The Unloveline&s;s of Love-locks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the &s;ale of the late lady Wor&s;eley, was the portrait of the duche&s;s of So|mer&s;et, daughter of Robert earl of E&s;&s;ex, [Q. Elizabeth's favorite] with a lock of her father's hair hanging on her neck; and the lock it&s;elf was in the &s;ame auction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;ectaries, in oppo&s;ition to the king, had run into the extreme
again&s;t politene&s;s: The new court, to indemnify them&s;elves and mark
aver&s;ion to their rigid adver&s;aries, took the other extreme. Elegance
and delicacy were the point from which both &s;ides &s;tarted different
ways; and ta&s;te was as little &s;ought by the men of wit, as by tho&s;e
who called them&s;elves the men of God. The latter thought that to
demoli&s;h was to reform; the others, that ridicule was the only rational
corrective; and thus while one party de&s;troyed all order, and the
other gave a loo&s;e to di&s;order, no wonder the age produced &s;carce any
work of art, that was worthy of being pre&s;erved by po&s;terity, Yet
in a hi&s;tory of the arts, as in other hi&s;tories, the times of confu&s;ion and
barbari&s;m mu&s;t have their place to pre&s;erve the connection, and to
a&s;certain the ebb and flow of genius. One likes to &s;ee through what
<PB N="4" REF="5" MS="y">
clouds broke forth the age of Augu&s;tus. The pages that follow will
pre&s;ent the reader with few memorable names; the number mu&s;t
atone for merit, if that can be thought any atonement. The fir&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue was told by old Mr. Laroon, who &s;aw him in York&s;hire, that the celebrated Rembrandt was in England in 1661, and lived 16 or 18 months at Hull, where he drew &s;everal gentlemen and &s;eafaring per&s;ons. Mr. Dahl had one of tho&s;e pictures. There are two fine whole lengths at Yarmouth, which might be done at the &s;ame time. As there is no other evidence of Rembrandt being in England, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to make a &s;eperate article for him, e&s;pe|cially at a time when he is &s;o well known, and his works in &s;uch repute, that his &s;cratches, with the difference only of a black hor&s;e or a white one, &s;ell for thirty guineas.</NOTE>
per&s;on who made any figure, and who was properly a remnant of a
better age, was</P>
<P>ISAAC FULLER,</P>
<P>Of his family or ma&s;ters, I find no account, except that he &s;tudied
many years in France under Perrier, who engraved the antique
&s;tatues. Graham &s;ays "he wanted the regular improvements of
travel to con&s;ider the antiques, and under&s;tood the anatomic part of
painting, perhaps equal to Michael Angelo, following it &s;o clo&s;e,
that he was very apt to make the mu&s;celling too &s;trong and promi|nent."
But this writer was not aware that the very fault he objects
to Fuller did not proceed from not having &s;een the antiques, but from
having &s;een them too partially, and that he was only to be compa|red
to Michael Angelo from a &s;imilitude of errors, flowing from a
&s;imilitude of &s;tudy. Each caught the robu&s;t &s;tyle from ancient &s;tatu|ary,
without attaining it's graces. If Graham had avoided hyperbole,

<PB N="5" REF="7">
he had not fallen into a blunder. In his hi&s;toric compo&s;itions Fuller
is a wretched painter, his colouring was raw and unnatural, and not
compen&s;ated by di&s;po&s;ition or invention. In portraits his pencil was
bold, &s;trong, and ma&s;terly: Men who &s;hine in the latter, and mi&s;carry
in the former, want imagination. They &s;ucceed only in what they &s;ee.
Liotard is a living in&s;tance of this &s;terility. He cannot paint a blue
ribband if a lady is dre&s;&s;ed in purple knots. If he had been in the
pri&s;on at the death of Socrates, and the pa&s;&s;ions were as permanent as
the per&s;ons on whom they act, he might have made a finer picture
than Nicol&ograve; Pou&s;&s;in.</P>
<P>Graham &s;peaks of Fuller as extravagant and burle&s;que in his man|ners,
and &s;ays, that they influenced the &s;tyle of his works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">El&s;um in an epigram, that is not one of his wor&s;t, agrees with this opinion;
On a drunken Sot,
His head does on his &s;houlder lean,
His eyes are &s;unk and hardly &s;een;
Who &s;ees this &s;ot in his own colour
Is apt to &s;ay, 'twas done by Fuller.</NOTE>. The
former character &s;eems more true than the latter. I have a picture
of Ogleby by him, in which he certainly has not deba&s;ed his &s;ubject,
but has made Ogleby appear a moon&s;truck bard, in&s;tead of a con|temptible
one. The compo&s;ition has more of Salvator than of Brau|wer.
His own <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is much damaged, and was given to the Univer&s;ity by Dr. Clarke.</NOTE> portrait in the gallery at Oxford is capricious, but
touched with great force and character. His altar-pieces at <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Addi&s;on wrote a latin poem in prai&s;e of it.</NOTE> Mag|dalen
and All-&s;ouls colleges in Oxford are de&s;picable. At Wadham
college is an altar-cloth in a &s;ingular manner, and of merit: It is ju&s;t
bru&s;hed over for the lights and &s;hades, and the colours melted in with
a hot iron. He painted too the in&s;ide of St. Mary Abchurch in Canon-&s;treet.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8" MS="y">
While Fuller was at Oxford he drew &s;everal portraits, and copied
Dob&s;on's decollation of St. John, but varying the faces from real per|&s;ons.
For Herodias, who held the charger, he painted his own mi&s;|tre&s;s;
her mother for the old woman receiving the head in a bag, and
the ruffian, who cut it off, was a noted brui&s;er of that age. There was
be&s;ides a little boy with a torch, which illuminated the whole picture.
Fuller received 60 pieces for it. In king James's catalogue is men|tioned
a picture by him, repre&s;enting Fame and Honour treading
down Envy. Colonel Seymour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vertue bought it, and from his &s;ale I purcha&s;ed it.</NOTE> had a head of Pierce, the carver,
by Fuller. He was much employed to paint the great taverns <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir P. Lely &s;eeing a portrait of Norris, the king's frame-maker, an old grey-headed man, finely painted by Fuller, lamented that &s;uch a genius &s;hould drown his talents in wine.</NOTE> in
London; particularly the mitre in Fenchurch-&s;treet, where he adorn|ed
all the &s;ides of a great room in pannels, as was then the fa&s;hion.
The figures were as large as life; a Venus, Satyr and &s;leeping Cupid;
a boy riding a goat and another fallen down, over the chimney; this
was the be&s;t part of the performance, &s;ays Vertue; Saturn devouring
a child, Mercury, Minerva, Diana, Apollo; and Bacchus, Venus, and
Ceres embracing; a young Silenus fallen down, and holding a goblet,
into which a boy was pouring wine; the &s;ea&s;ons between the win|dows,
and on the ceiling two angels &s;upporting a mitre, in a large
circle; this part was very bad, and the colouring of the Saturn too
raw, and his figure too mu&s;cular. He painted five very large pictures,
the hi&s;tory of the king's e&s;cape after the battle of Worce&s;ter; they
co&s;t a great &s;um, but were little e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>Vertue had &s;een two books with etchings by Fuller; the fir&s;t, Cae&s;ar
<PB N="7" REF="9">
Ripa's Emblems; &s;ome of the plates by Fuller, others by Henry
Cooke and Tempe&s;ta. The &s;econd was called, Libro da Di&s;egnare;
8 or 10 of the plates by our painter.</P>
<P>He died in Bloom&s;bury-&s;quare, July 17, 1672, and left a &s;on, an in|genious
but idle man, according to Vertue, chiefly employed in coach-painting.
He led a di&s;&s;olute life and died young.</P>
<P>Fuller had one Scholar, Charles Woodfield; who entered under him
at Oxford, and &s;erved &s;even years. He generally painted views,
buildings, monuments, and antiquities, but being as idle as his ma&s;|ter's
&s;on, often wanted nece&s;&s;aries. He died &s;uddenly in his chair in
the year 1724, at the age of 75.</P>
<P>CORNELIUS BOLL,</P>
<P>A painter of whom I find no particulars, but that he made views of
London before the fire, which proves that he was here early in this
reign if not in the la&s;t; the&s;e views were at Sutton-place in Surrey,
and repre&s;ented Arundel-hou&s;e, Somer&s;et-hou&s;e and the Tower.
Vertue, who &s;aw them, &s;ays, they were in a good free ta&s;te.</P>
<P>JOHN FREEMAN,</P>
<P>An hi&s;toric painter, was a rival of Fuller, which &s;eems to have been
his greate&s;t glory. He was thought to have been poi&s;oned in the
We&s;t-indies, but however died in England, after having been em|ployed
in painting &s;cenes for the theatre in Covent-garden <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham p. 419.</NOTE>.

</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10" MS="y">REM&Egrave;E or REMIGIUS VAN LEMPUT,</P>
<P>Was born at Antwerp, and arrived at &s;ome excellence by copying
the works of Vandyck; he imitated too with &s;ucce&s;s the Flemi&s;h
ma&s;ters, as Stone did the Italians; and for the works of Lely, Rem&egrave;e
told that ma&s;ter that he could copy them better than Sir Peter could
him&s;elf. I have already mentioned his &s;mall picture from Holbein,
of the two Henrys and their queens, and that his purcha&s;e in king
Charles's &s;ale of the king on hor&s;eback was taken from him, by a &s;uit
at law, after he had demanded 1500 guineas for it at Antwerp and
been bid 1000. The earl of Pomfret at Ea&s;ton had a copy of Ra|phael's
Galatea by him, and at Pen&s;hur&s;t is a &s;mall whole length of
Francis earl of Bedford aet. 48, 1636, from Vandyck. Mr. Stevens,
hi&s;toriographer to the king, had &s;ome portraits of his family painted
by Rem&egrave;e. The latter had a well-cho&s;en collection of prints and
drawings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham, p. 458.</NOTE>. He died in Nov. 1675, and was buried in the church-yard
of Covent-garden, as his &s;on Charles had been in 1651. His daughter
was a paintre&s;s, and married to Thomas, brother of</P>
<P>ROBERT STREATER,</P>
<P>Who was appointed &s;erjeant painter at the re&s;toration. He was the
&s;on of a painter and born in Covent-garden, 1624, and &s;tudied under
Du Moulin. Streater did not confine him&s;elf to any branch of his art,
but &s;ucceeded be&s;t in architecture, per&s;pective, land&s;cape and &s;till life.
Graham calls him the greate&s;t and mo&s;t univer&s;al painter that ever

England bred, but with about as much judgment, as where he &s;ays
that Streater's being a good hi&s;torian contributed not a little to his
perfection in that way of painting. He might as well &s;ay that read|ing
the Rape of the Lock would make one a good hair-cutter. I
&s;hould rely more on Sander&s;on, who &s;peaking of land&s;cape, &s;ays "of
our own nation I know none more excellent but Streater, who indeed
is a compleat ma&s;ter therein, as al&s;o in other arts of etching, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He engraved a plate of the battle of Na&s;eby. The plates for Sir Robert Stapleton's Juvenal were de&s;igned by Streater, Barlow and Danckers.</NOTE> graving,
and his work of architecture and per&s;pective; not a line but is true to
the rules of art and &s;ymmetry <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Graphice, p, 19.</NOTE>." And again, comparing our own
countrymen with foreigners, in different branches, he adds, "Streater
in all paintings <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 20.</NOTE>." But from the few works that I have &s;een of his
hand, I can by no means &s;ub&s;cribe to the&s;e encomiums: The Theatre
at Oxford, his principal performance, is a very mean one; yet Streater
was as much commended for it, as by the authors I have mentioned
for his works in general. One Robert Whitehall <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">V. Wood's Athenae, vol. ii. p. 786. A de&s;cription in pro&s;e of that paint|ing is in the new Oxford-guide.</NOTE>, a poeta&s;ter of
that age, wrote a poem called Urania, or a de&s;cription of the painting
at the top of the Theatre at Oxford, which concluded with the&s;e lines,<Q><L>That future ages mu&s;t confe&s;s they owe</L>
<L>To Streater more than Michael Angelo.</L></Q>At Oxford Streater painted too the chapel at All-&s;ouls, except the
Re&s;urrection, which is the work of Sir James Thornhill. Vertue

to perform the operation. He had a good collection of Italian books,
prints, drawings and pictures, which, on the death of his &s;on in 1711,
were &s;old by auction. Among them were the following by Streater

He painted &s;till-life, oranges and lemons, plate, dama&s;k curtains,
cloths of gold, and that medley of familiar objects that &s;trike the
ignorant vulgar. In Streater's &s;ale, mentioned above, were near thirty

earl of Radnor, who at his hou&s;e in St. James's &s;quare, had near
eighteen or twenty of his works, over doors and chimnies, &amp;c.
there was one large piece, loaded with fruit, flowers, and dead game

the Prebendaries of We&s;tmin&s;ter, was born in St. Martin's-lane,

for it's loyalty, accompli&s;hments, and wit, and this young lady pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="26" REF="34">
to be one of it's faire&s;t ornaments. Antony Wood &s;ays &s;he was
a grace for beauty, and a mu&s;e for wit. Dryden has celebrated her
genius for painting and poetry in a very long ode, in which the rich
&s;tream of his numbers has hurried along with it all that his luxuriant
fancy produced in his way; it is an harmonious hyperbole compo&s;ed
of the fall of Adam, Arethu&s;a, Ve&s;tal Virgins, Diana, Cupid, Noah's|ark,
the Pleiades, the valley of Jeho&s;aphat and the la&s;t A&s;&s;izes: Yet
Antony Wood a&s;&s;ures us "there is nothing &s;poken of her, which &s;he
was not equal to, if not &s;uperior;" and his proof is as wi&s;e as his
a&s;&s;ertion, for, &s;ays he, "if there had not been more true hi&s;tory in
her prai&s;es, than compliment, her father would never have &s;uffered
them to pa&s;s the pre&s;s." She was maid of honour to the duche&s;s of
York, and died of the &s;mall-pox in 1685, in the 25th year of her
age.</P>
<P>Her poems were publi&s;hed after her death in a thin quarto, with a
print of her, taken from her portrait drawn by her&s;elf, which, with
the leave of the authors I have quoted, is in a much better &s;tyle than
her poetry, and evidently in the manner of Sir Peter Lely. She drew
the pictures of James II. and of her mi&s;tre&s;s, Mary of Modena; &s;ome
pieces of &s;till-life and of hi&s;tory; three of the latter &s;he has recorded
in her own poems, St. John in the wilderne&s;s, Herodias with the
head of that &s;aint, and two of Diana's nymphs. At admiral Killi|grew's

Adonis; a Satyr playing on a pipe; Judith and Holofernes; a wo|man's

from whom I tran&s;cribe, &s;ays that in that &s;tyle he equalled the be&s;t
ma&s;ters of that country, and that pa&s;&s;ing into England he was
reckoned a &s;econd Vandyck. If he was thought &s;o then, it is entirely
forgotten. Both Graham and Vertue knew &s;o little of him, that the
fir&s;t mentions him not, and the latter confounded him with Valentine
Le Fevre of Bru&s;&s;els, who never was here; yet mentions a mezzo|tint
of Alexandre Boudan imprimeur du roi, done at Paris by Sarabe,
the eyes of which were printed in blue and the face and hands in fle&s;h-colour.

<P>LE FEVRE DE VENISE,</P>
<P>Who&s;e chri&s;tian name was Roland, and who he &s;ays gained the favour
of prince Rupert by a &s;ecret of &s;taining marble. As that prince in|vented
mezzotinto, I conclude it was Claude who learned it of his
highne&s;s, during his intercour&s;e with him, and communicated it to
Sarabe at Paris. Le Fevre de Veni&s;e certainly was in England and
died here, as Claude did. Vertue &s;ays that his Le Fevre painted
chiefly portraits and hi&s;tories in &s;mall, in the manner of Vandyck,
the latter of which were not always very decent. As I am de&s;irous of

make him decline, I mean the la&s;t article, I am inclined to be&s;tow the

<P>Remarkable for copying Vandyck well, and for being a rival of Lely.
A portrait of him&s;elf in water-colours, purcha&s;ed by colonel Seymour
at Mr. Bryan's &s;ale, ill drawn but &s;trongly coloured, induced Vertue
to think that Lely was not the only per&s;on whom Hayls had an am|bition
to rival, but that this was a fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay in competition with
Cooper. However I find by a note in a different volume, that &s;ome
thought this miniature was by Ho&s;kins. At Woburn is the portrait
of colonel John Ru&s;&s;el, (of whom there is a better picture in the Me|moires

<P>SIMON VARELST,</P>
<P>A real ornament of Charles's reign, and one of the few who have ar|rived
at capital excellence in that branch of the art, was a Dutch
flower-painter. It is not certain in what year he arrived in England;
his works were extremely admired, and his prices the greate&s;t that had
been known in this country. The duke of Buckingham patronized
him, but having too much wit to be only beneficent, and perceiving
the poor man to be immoderately vain, he piqued him to attempt
portraits. Varel&s;t thinking nothing impo&s;&s;ible to his pencil, fell into
<PB N="34" REF="44">
the &s;nare, and drew the duke him&s;elf, but crouded it &s;o much with
fruits and &s;un-flowers, that the king, to whom it was &s;howed, took it
for a flower-piece. However, as it &s;ometimes happens to wi&s;er buf|foons
than Varel&s;t, he was laughed at till he was admired, and Sir
Peter Lely him&s;elf became the real &s;acrifice to the je&s;t: he lo&s;t much
of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and retired to Kew, while Varel&s;t engro&s;&s;ed the fa&s;hion,
and for one half length was paid an hundred and ten pounds. His
portraits were exceedingly laboured, and fini&s;hed with the &s;ame deli|cacy
as his flowers, which he continued to introduce into them.
Lord chancellor Shaft&s;bury going to &s;it, was received by him with his
hat on. Don't you know me? &s;aid the peer. Yes, replied the pain|ter,
you are my lord chancellor. And do you know me? I am Va|rel&s;t.
The king can make any man chancellor, but he can make no|body

The king's bounty did not &s;top here; Verrio had a place of ma&s;|ter-gardiner,
and a lodging at the end of the park, now Carleton-hou&s;e.
He was expen&s;ive, and kept a great table, and often pre&s;&s;ed
the king for money with a freedom which his maje&s;ty's own frankne&s;s
indulged. Once at Hampton-court, when he had but lately received
an advance of a thou&s;and pounds, he found the king in &s;uch a circle
that he could not approach. He called out, Sire, I de&s;ire the favour
of &s;peaking to your maje&s;ty.&mdash;Well, Verrio, &s;aid the king, what is
your reque&s;t? Money, Sir, I am &s;o &s;hort in ca&s;h, that I am not able
to pay my workmen, and your maje&s;ty and I have learned by expe|rience,
that pedlars and painters cannot give credit long. The king
&s;miled, and &s;aid he had but lately ordered him 1000<HI>l.</HI> Yes, Sir, re|plied
he, but that was &s;oon paid away, and I have no gold left. At
that rate, &s;aid the king, you would &s;pend more than I do, to main|tain
my family. True, an&s;wered Verrio, but does your maje&s;ty keep
an open table as I do?</P>
<P>He gave the de&s;igns for the large eque&s;trian picture of that monarch
in the hall at Chel&s;ea-college; but it was fini&s;hed by Cook, and pre|&s;ented
by lord Ranelagh.</P>
<P>On the acce&s;&s;ion of James II. Verrio was again employed at Wind|&s;or,
in Wol&s;ey's Tomb-hou&s;e, then de&s;tined for a Romi&s;h-chapel. He
painted that king and &s;everal of his courtiers, in the ho&s;pital of
Chri&s;t-church London. Among other portraits there is Dr. Hawes,
a phy&s;ician; Vertue &s;aw the original head from whence he tran&s;lated
it into the great piece, which Verrio pre&s;ented to the ho&s;pital. He
painted too at that of St. Bartholomew.</P>
<P>The revolution was by no means agreable to Verrio's religion or
principles. He quitted his place, and even refu&s;ed to work for king
<PB N="39" REF="50" MS="y">
William. From that time he was for &s;ome years employed at the lord
Exeter's at Burleigh, and afterwards at Chat&s;worth. At the former
he painted &s;everal chambers, which are reckoned among his be&s;t
works. He has placed his own portrait in the room where he repre|&s;ented
the hi&s;tory of Mars and Venus; and for the Bacchus be&s;triding
a hog&s;head, he has, according to his u&s;ual liberty <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was more excu&s;able, that when his patron obliged him to in&s;ert a pope, in a proce&s;&s;ion not very honorable to the Romi&s;h religion, he added the portrait of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury then living.</NOTE>, borrowed the
countenance of a dean, with whom he was at variance. At Chat&s;|worth
is much of his hand. The altar-piece in the chapel is the be&s;t
piece I ever &s;aw of his; the &s;ubject, the incredulity of St. Thomas.
He was employed too at Lowther-hall, but the hou&s;e has been burnt.
At la&s;t by per&s;ua&s;ion of lord Exeter he conde&s;cended to &s;erve king
William, and was &s;ent to Hampton-court, where among other things
he painted the great &s;tair-ca&s;e, and as ill, as if he had &s;poiled it out
of principle. His eyes failing him *, queen Anne gave him a pen&s;ion
of 200<HI>l.</HI> a year for life, but he did not enjoy it long, dying at
Hampton-court in 1707.</P>
<P>Scheffers of Utrecht was employed by Verrio for twenty-five years.
At his fir&s;t arrival he had worked for picture-&s;ellers. Lan&s;cron was
another painter in Verrio's &s;ervice, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him &s;even or eight
years at Wind&s;or.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was not only this decay, but his death that prevented his being employed at Blenheim, as probably was intended, for the author of &s;ome ver&s;es addre&s;&s;ed to Verrio in the &s;ixth volume of Dryden's mi&s;cellanies, carried his prophetic imagination &s;o far as to behold the duke's triumphs repre&s;ented there by our painter; who died before the hou&s;e was built.</NOTE>

</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="51" MS="y">JAMES HUYSMAN or HOUSMAN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham.</NOTE></P>
<P>Was born at Antwerp in 1656, and &s;tudied under Bakerel, a &s;cholar
of Rubens, and competitor of Vandyck. Bakerel was a poet too,
and a &s;atyric one, and having writ an invective again&s;t the Je&s;uits,
was obliged to fly. Huy&s;man, deprived of his ma&s;ter, came to
England, and painted both hi&s;tory and portraits. In the latter he
rivalled Sir Peter Lely, and with rea&s;on. His picture of lady Byron
over the chimney in the beauty-room at Wind&s;or, is at lea&s;t as highly
fini&s;hed and coloured with as much force as Sir Peter's works in that
chamber, tho' the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I find in Vertue's notes that he had been told it is not lady Byron, but lady Bella&s;&s;is. If it was the lady Bella&s;&s;is, who was mi&s;tre&s;s to king James, it becomes more valuable, and while Charles paid his brother the compliment of enrolling the latter's mi&s;tre&s;s with his own, he tacitly in&s;inuated how much better a ta&s;te he had him&s;elf. I have an unfini&s;hed head by Cooper of king James's lady Bella&s;&s;is, which is hi&s;torically plain. Huy&s;man's picture has certainly &s;ome re&s;emblance to the mezzotinto of her from Sir Peter Lely.</NOTE> lady who &s;at for it is the lea&s;t hand&s;ome of the
&s;et. His Cupids were admired; him&s;elf was mo&s;t partial to his pic|ture
of queen Catherine. There is a mezzotinto from it, repre&s;enting
her like St. Catherine. King James <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his catalogue. There too is mentioned the duche&s;s of Richmond in man's apparel by Huy&s;man. It is a pretty picture, now at Ken&s;ington: the dre&s;s is that of a Cavalier about the time of the civil war, buff with blue ribbands.</NOTE> had another in the dre&s;s of a
&s;hepherde&s;s; and there is a third in Painter's-hall. He created
him&s;elf the queen's painter, and to ju&s;tify it, made her &s;it for every
Madonna or Venus that he drew. His capital work was over the
<PB N="41" REF="52" MS="y">
altar of her chapel at St. James's, now the French church. He died
in 1696, and was buried in St. James's-church.</P>
<P>Vertue mentions another painter of the &s;ame &s;urname, whom he
calls Michlaer Huy&s;man of Mecklin, and &s;ays he lived at Antwerp;
that he &s;tudied the Italians, and painted land&s;capes in their manner,
which he adorned with buildings and animals. He came to England,
and brought two large land&s;capes, which he kept to &s;hew what he
could do; for the&s;e he had frames richly carved by Gibbons, and
gave the latter two pictures in exchange. In a &s;ale in 1743 Vertue
&s;aw three &s;mall land&s;capes and figures by him of great merit. On
the revolution he returned to Antwerp, and died there 1707, aged
near 70.</P>
<P>MICHAEL WRIGHT,</P>
<P>Was born in Scotland, but came to London at the age of 16 or 17,
and proved no bad portrait-painter. In 1672 he drew for Sir Robert
Vyner a whole length of prince Rupert in armour with a large wig.
On the back he wrote the prince's titles at length, and his own name
thus, Jo. Michael Wright Lond. pictor regius pinxit 1672. The earl
of Oxford had a half length by him of Sir Edward Turner, &s;on of
Sir Edward, &s;peaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons and chief baron. On
that he called him&s;elf Jo&s;. Michael Wright <HI>Anglus,</HI> 1672, but on the
portraits of the judges in Guildhall he wrote <HI>Scotus.</HI> Sir Peter Lely
was to have drawn the&s;e pictures, but refu&s;ing to wait on the judges
at their own chambers, Wright got the bu&s;ine&s;s, and received 60<HI>l.</HI> for
each piece. Two of his mo&s;t admired works were a highland laird
and an Iri&s;h tory, whole lengths in their proper dre&s;&s;es, of which &s;eve|ral
<PB N="42" REF="53">
copies were made. At Wind&s;or is his large picture of John
Lacy the comedian in three different characters, Par&s;on Scruple in
the Cheats, Sandy in the Taming of the Shrew, and Mon&s;ieur de
Vice in the Country Captain. It was painted in 1675, and &s;everal
copies taken from it. He twice drew a duke of Cambridge &s;on of
king James <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. catalogue.</NOTE>, perhaps the two children who bore that title; one of
them is in the king's clo&s;et at St. James's. He painted too a cieling
in the king's bedchamber at Whitehall.</P>
<P>Wright attended Roger Palmer earl of Ca&s;tlemain, as &s;teward of
his hou&s;hold, on his emba&s;&s;y to the Pope, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is well known with what neglect and indifference this Emba&s;&s;y was re|ceived by the Pope. The Je&s;uits endeavoured to compen&s;ate for the Pontiff's contempt: they treated Ca&s;tlemaine in a mo&s;t magnificent manner, and all the arts were called in to demon&s;trate their zeal, and compliment the bigot-monarch. But the good fathers were unlucky in &s;ome of their in&s;criptions, which furni&s;hed ample matter for ridicule; particularly &s;peaking of James, they &s;aid, <HI>Alas Carolo addidit</HI>; and that the former might chu&s;e an Emba&s;&s;ador worthy of &s;ending to heaven, <HI>He di&s;patched his brother.</HI> V. Hi&s;t. of England in two volumes. Vol. ii. p. 113. 5th edition 1723.</NOTE> and at his return publi&s;hed
a pompous account of it, fir&s;t in Italian, then in Engli&s;h. He had
been in Italy before. At his return from the emba&s;&s;y he was morti|fied
to find that Sir Godfrey Kneller had engro&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of his bu&s;i|ne&s;s.
In 1700, upon a vacancy of the king's painter in Scotland,
he &s;ollicited to &s;ucceed, but a &s;hop-keeper was preferred&mdash;and in
truth Wright had not much preten&s;ions to favour in that reign&mdash;yet
as good as his fellow-labourer Tate, who wrote panegyrics in Wright's
edition of the emba&s;&s;y, and yet was made Poet Laureat to king Wil|liam.
<PB N="43" REF="54" MS="y">
Orlandi mentions Wright; "Michaele <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. T. Pelham of Stanmore has a &s;mall three-quarters of Mrs. Cleypole, on which is written M. Ritus. Fec. It is an emblematic piece, the allegory of which is very ob&s;cure, but highly fini&s;hed. There is another exactly the &s;ame, except that it wants the painter's name, at Ea&s;t Hor&s;ley, formerly the &s;eat of Sir Edward Nicholas.</NOTE> Rita Ingle&s;e notato
nel Catalogo degli Academici di Roma nel anno 1688." Wright
left a &s;on at Rome, who was ma&s;ter of languages and died there.
He had a nephew too of his own name, educated at Rome, but who
&s;ettled in Ireland, where he had &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that he gained 900<HI>l.</HI>
the fir&s;t year, and was always paid 10<HI>l.</HI> a head. Pooley and Magda|len
Smith were there at the &s;ame time; the latter and young Wright
were rivals.</P>
<P>Wright the uncle had a fine collection of gems and coins, which
were purcha&s;ed by Sir Hans Sloane after his death, which happened
about the year 1700, in James-&s;treet Covent-garden. He is buried
in that church.</P>
<P>EDMUND ASHFIELD <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Graham.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>Scholar of Wright, was well de&s;cended, and painted both in oil and
crayons, in which he made great improvements for multiplying the
tints. He in&s;tructed Lutterel, who added the invention of u&s;ing
crayons on copper plates. Vertue had &s;een a head of Sir John Ben|net,
afterwards lord O&s;&s;ul&s;ton, painted neatly by A&s;hfield, tho' not in
a good manner: but at Burleigh is a &s;mall portrait of a lady Herbert

<P>Was born at Harlem in 1627, and learned of Francis Hals, who&s;e

was very kind <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;camps &s;ays, that Lely growing jealous of Roe&s;traten, propo&s;ed to him a partition of the art; portraits were to be monopolized by Lely; all other branches were to be ceded to Roe&s;traten, who&s;e works were to be vaunted by Lely, and for which by the&s;e means he received 40 and 50 guineas. It is very improbable that an arti&s;t &s;hould relinqui&s;h that branch of his bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;uch a propo&s;al told him he was mo&s;t capable of executing.</NOTE> to him at his arrival in England, and introduced
him to king Charles, but it does not appear that he was encouraged
at court, nothing of his hand appearing in the palaces or royal cata|logues;
he found more countenance from the nobility. There is a
good picture by him at Kiveton, the &s;eat of the duke of Leeds, one
at Chat&s;worth, and two were at lord Pomfret's. At lord Radnor's
fale in 1724 were three or four of his pictures, particularly one repre|&s;enting
the crown, &s;cepter and globe. He was particularly fond of
drawing wrought plate. At the counte&s;s of Guildford's at Walde|&s;hare
in Kent are &s;ome of his works. I have one, well coloured, con|taining
an ivory tankard, &s;ome figures in bronze, and a medal of
Charles II. appendent to a blue ribband. It is certain that he arrived
early in this reign, for he hurt his hip at the fire of London and went
lame for the re&s;t of his life. Graham &s;ays, that having promi&s;ed to

<P>GERARD SOEST, called ZOUST,</P>
<P>Was born in We&s;tphalia, and came to England probably before the

De&s;cribing a picture of a hu&s;band and wife, he &s;ays, "It mu&s;t be valued an ornament to the dyning-room; being be&s;ides well known to be the art of Sow&s;t's handy-work, and he a ma&s;ter of &s;ufficiencie.

reputation. By what I have &s;een of his hand, particularly his
own head at Houghton, he was an admirable ma&s;ter. It is animated
with truth and nature; round, bold, yet highly fini&s;hed. His dra|peries
were often of &s;attin, in which he imitated the manner of Ter|burgh,
a Dutch painter of conver&s;ations, but enlarged his ideas, on
&s;eeing Vandyck. He was inli&s;ted among the rivals of Sir Peter Lely;
the number of them is &s;ufficient honour to the latter. Emulation &s;el|dom
unites a whole profe&s;&s;ion again&s;t one, unle&s;s he is clearly their
&s;uperior. Soe&s;t is commended by Vertue and Graham for his por|traits
of men: Both confe&s;s that his ta&s;te was too Dutch and ungrace|ful,
and his humour too rough to plea&s;e the &s;ofter &s;ex. The gentle
manners of Sir Peter carried them all from his competitor. Soe&s;t
who was capricious, &s;lovenly and covetous, often went to the door
him&s;elf, and if he was not in a humour to draw tho&s;e who came to &s;it,
<PB N="46" REF="59">
or was employed in the meaner offices of his family, he would act the
&s;ervant and &s;ay his ma&s;ter was not at home: his dre&s;s made him ea&s;ily
mi&s;taken. Once when he lived in Cur&s;itor's-alley, he admitted two
ladies, but quitted the hou&s;e him&s;elf.&mdash;His wife was obliged to &s;ay,

at the corner hou&s;e in Holbourn-row, and he &s;howed them a man and
hor&s;e large as life on which he was then at work, out of humour with
the public and the fairer half of it. In Jerva&s;e's &s;ale was a portrait
of Mr. John Norris by Soe&s;t, which Jerva&s;e e&s;teemed &s;o much, that
he copied it more than once, and even imitated it in his fir&s;t pictures.
On the back was written 1685, but that was a mi&s;take; Soe&s;t died
in Feb. 1681. I have a head by him, I believe of Griffiere; it has a
mantle of purple &s;attin, admirably coloured. At the Royal Society is
a head of Dr. John Wallis; at Draper's-hall Sheldon Lord Mayor,
whole length; in the audit-room of Chri&s;t-church Oxford, a head of
Fuller bi&s;hop of Lincoln; and at Wimpole was a good double half|length

<P>A Dutch land&s;cape-painter, lived here long and painted much; chiefly
glades, dark oaken groves, land-&s;torms and water-falls; and in Swi&s;|&s;erland,
where he re&s;ided too, he drew many views of the Alps. He
died in London about 1680. In king James's catalogue, where are

He lived ten years after the preceding.

<P>ADAM COLONI,</P>
<P>Of Roterdam, lived many years in England, and was famous for &s;mall

<P>JOHN GRIFFIERE,</P>
<P>An agreable painter, called the gentleman of Utrecht, was born at
Am&s;terdam in 1645, and placed apprentice to a carpenter, a profe&s;|&s;ion
not at all &s;uiting his inclination. He knew he did not like to be
a carpenter, but had not di&s;covered his own bent. He quitted his
ma&s;ter, and was put to &s;chool, but becoming acquainted with a lad
<PB N="49" REF="62">
who was learning to paint earthen-ware, young Griffiere was &s;truck
with the &s;cience tho' in &s;o rude a form, and pa&s;&s;ed his time in a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing
his friend in&s;tead of going to &s;chool, yet returning regularly at
night as if he had been there. This deception however could not
long impo&s;e on his father, who prudently yielded to the force of the
boy's genius, but while he gratified it, hoped to &s;ecure him a profe&s;|&s;ion,
and bound him to the &s;ame ma&s;ter with his friend the tyle|painter.
Griffiere improved &s;o much even in that coar&s;e &s;chool, that
he was placed with a painter of flowers, and then in&s;tructed by one
Roland Rogman, who&s;e land&s;capes were e&s;teemed. He received oc|ca&s;ional
le&s;&s;ons too from Adrian Vandevelde, Rui&s;dale, and Rem|brant,
who&s;e peculiarity of &s;tyle, and facility of glory, acquired rather
by a bold trick of extravagant chiaro &s;curo than by genius, captiva|ted
the young painter, and tempted him to pur&s;ue that manner. But
Rogman di&s;&s;uaded him, and Griffiere tho' often indulging his ta&s;te,
&s;eems to have been fixed by his ma&s;ter to land&s;capes, which he execu|ted
with richne&s;s and neat colouring, and enlivened with &s;mall figures,
cattle and buildings.</P>
<P>When he quitted Rogman and Utrecht, he went to Roterdam, and
&s;oon after the fire of London, came to England, married and &s;ettled
here; received &s;ome in&s;tructions from Loten, but ea&s;ily excelled him.
He drew &s;ome views of London, Italian ruins and pro&s;pects on the
Rhine. Such mixed &s;cenes of rivers and rich country were his favo|rite
&s;ubjects. He bought a yatch, embarked with his family and
his pencils, and pa&s;&s;ed his whole time on the Thames, between Wind|&s;or,
Greenwich, Grave&s;end, &amp;c. Be&s;ides the&s;e views, he excelled in
copying Italian and Flemi&s;h ma&s;ters, particularly Polenburgh, Teni|ers,
Hondecooter, Rembrandt and Ruy&s;dale.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="63">
After &s;taying here many years, he &s;ailed in his own yatch to Roter|dam,
but being tempted by a pilot who was coming to England,
&s;uddenly embarked again for this country, but was &s;hipwrecked, and
lo&s;t his whole cargo except a little gold which his daughter had wrap|ped
in a leathern girdle. He remained in Holland ten or twelve years:
and returning to England, &s;truck upon a &s;and-bank, where he was
eight days before he could get off. This new calamity cured him of
his pa&s;&s;ion for living on the water. He took a hou&s;e in Millbank,
where he lived &s;everal years, and died in 1718, aged above 72. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His pictures were &s;old in Covent-garden after his death, with a collection by Italian and Flemi&s;h ma&s;ters, brought from Holland by his &s;on Robert. Among the father's paintings were &s;ome in imitation of the different manners of El&s;heim|er, Polenburg, Pou&s;&s;in, Wouverman, Berghem, Titian, Salvator Ro&s;a, Gerard Dou, Ba&s;&s;an, Guido, and Vanderwerffe. In the &s;ame catalogue is mentioned a piece in water-colours by Polenburg.</NOTE> In
lord Orford's collection are two pretty pictures by him, a &s;ea-port
and a land&s;cape. He etched &s;ome &s;mall plates of birds and bea&s;ts
from drawings of Barlow, and five large half-&s;heet plates of birds in
a &s;et of twelve; the other &s;even were done by Fr. Place.</P>
<P>Robert Griffiere, his &s;on, born in England 1688, was bred under
his father, and made good progre&s;s in the art. He was in Ireland
when his father was &s;hip-wrecked, and going to him in Holland, imi|tated
his manner of painting and that of Sachtleven. John Griffiere,
a good copyi&s;t of Claud Lorrain, and who died in Pall-mall a few
years ago, was, I believe, the younger &s;on of old Griffiere.</P>
<P>GERARD EDEMA,</P>
<P>Born according to Vertue in Frie&s;land; Graham &s;ays at Am&s;terdam,
<PB N="51" REF="64" MS="y">
was &s;cholar of Everding, who&s;e manner he followed, and of whom
there is a &s;mall book of mountainous pro&s;pects, containing &s;ome 50
plates. Edema came to England about 1670, and made voyages
both to Norway and Newfoundland, to collect &s;ubjects for his pictures
among tho&s;e wildne&s;&s;es of nature; he delighting in rocky views,
falls of water, and &s;cenes of horrour. For figures and buildings he
had no talent, and where he wanted them was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Wyck. The
latter, Vandevelde and Edema lived &s;ome time at Mount-Edgcumbe
with Sir Richard, grandfather of the pre&s;ent lord Edgcumbe, and
painted &s;everal views of the mount in concert, which are now in a
manner decayed. Edema's temper was not &s;o un&s;ociable as his ge|nius;
he loved the bottle, and died of it at Richmond about the year
1700; Graham &s;ays in the 40th year of his age, which probably is a
mi&s;take, if he came to England in 1670&mdash;he could not have learnt
much of Everding, if he quitted his &s;chool at ten years old.</P>

was un&s;ucce&s;sful, but Mr. Boyle finding in him &s;ome knowledge of

in one piece, dated 1676. The others, &s;mall ovals on copper of king
William and queen Mary, painted ju&s;t before the revolution, in the

high, containing the king's cavalcade through the gates of the city the
day before his coronation, but printed in 1662. He &s;ays not where

born at Am&s;terdam in 1633, and wanted no ma&s;ter but his father, till
the latter came to England; then for a &s;hort time he was placed with
Simon de Vlieger, an admired &s;hip-painter of that time, but who&s;e
name is only pre&s;erved now by being united to his di&s;ciple's. Young
William was &s;oon demanded by his father, and graciou&s;ly entertained

William, I &s;uppo&s;e, lived chiefly with his father at Greenwich, who

king Charles went to view them, and where he was repre&s;ented going

to beg it of the king, to cut it in two, and each to take a part. The

and plea&s;ing the marquis de Bethune, was made his major|domo,
employed to purcha&s;e pictures, and carried by him to France,
from whence he pa&s;&s;ed into England, and painted for king Charles a
chimney-piece at Whitehall, and a few other things <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He painted a view of Sterling-ca&s;tle, the figures by Wyck, from whence we may conclude that they took a journey to Scotland.</NOTE>; but demand|ing
extravagant prices, as 150 and 200<HI>l.</HI> for his pictures, he had not
many commi&s;&s;ions from court; and being as vain in his expence as
of his works, he grew into debt and was arre&s;ted. He &s;ued in vain
to the king for delivery: his countrymen freed him by a contribution.
Sir William Soames being &s;ent emba&s;&s;ador to Con&s;tantinople by
James II. Vo&s;terman accompanied him, intending to paint the delights
of that &s;ituation; but Sir William dying on the road, it is not cer|tain
what became of the painter: it is &s;aid that before his departure
from England, he had been invited to Poland by his old patron the
marquis de Bethune, and probably went thither on the death of the
emba&s;&s;ador <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Franci&s;co Mil&eacute;, a land&s;cape painter of Antwerp, was here towards the end of Charles's reign, but probably &s;taid not long.</NOTE>.</P>

of the Hague, from whence Wi&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ed into France, contracted
<PB N="62" REF="77" MS="y">
the furbelowed &s;tyle of that country and age, and came into England,
where at lea&s;t he learned it in it's perfection from Sir Peter Lely for
whom he worked, and after who&s;e death he grew into fa&s;hion. He
drew all the royal family, and particularly the duke of Monmouth &s;e|veral
times, which ingratiated him with the king and the ladies. Sir
Godfrey Kneller, then the ri&s;ing genius, was a formidable rival, but
death put an end to the conte&s;t in the thirty-fir&s;t year of Wi&s;&s;ing's age,
who decea&s;ed at Burleigh, the lord Exeter's, in 1687. He was buried
at the expence of that earl in St. Martin's Stamford, where again&s;t a
pillar in the middle i&s;le of the church, is a monumental table to his
memory; the in&s;cription may be &s;een in Graham. There are &s;everal
prints from his works, particularly one of queen Catherine with a dog.

<P>ADRIAN HENNY or HENNIN,</P>
<P>One of the la&s;t painters who arrived in the reign of Charles II. little
is known of him, but that having been two years in France, he adop|ted
the manner of Ga&s;par Pou&s;&s;in. Vertue thought he came in 1680;
if &s;o, the title-plate to a hi&s;tory of Oxford de&s;igned by him, and en|graved
by White in 1674, mu&s;t have been done antecedent to his ar|rival.
<PB N="63" REF="78">
He painted much at Eythorp, the &s;eat of Dormer lord Carnar|von,
now of Sir William Stanhope, and died here in 1710.</P>
<P>HERBERT TUER</P>
<P>Was &s;econd &s;on of Theophilus Tuer, by Catherine, neice of Mr.
George Herbert the poet: his grandfather and great-grandfather
were vicars, the former of El&s;enham in E&s;&s;ex, the latter of Sabridge|worth
in Hertford&s;hire, towards the latter end of Elizabeth. Herbert,
who received his name from his maternal uncle, withdrew with his
younge&s;t brother Theophilus, into Holland, after the death of Charles
1&s;t. The latter followed arms; Herbert applied to painting, and
made good progre&s;s in portraits, as appears by &s;ome &s;mall ones of
him&s;elf and family, now in England, where however they are little
known. A print of Sir Lionel Jenkins, probably drawn at Nime|guen,
is from a picture by Tuer. He married two wives, Mary Van
Gameren, daughter of a procurer of Utrecht, and Elizabeth Van Hey|menbergh.
John, his &s;on by the fir&s;t, was re&s;ident at Nimeguen with
his mother-in-law in 1680, at which time Herbert was dead. It is
believed that he died at Utrecht, where in the Painter's-hall is &s;aid to
be a head finely coloured by him.</P>
<P>TEMPESTA and TOMASO,</P>
<P>Two painters who worked at Wilton, painting cielings and pannels
of rooms. Tempe&s;ta was I believe, &s;on of a well-known painter of
the &s;ame name. Toma&s;o, and a brother of his, who was employed at
Wilton too, were brought over by Sir Charles Cotterel, for which rea|&s;on

<P>SAMUEL COOPER,</P>
<P>Owed great part of his merit to the works of Vandyck, and yet may
be called an original genius, as he was the fir&s;t who gave the &s;trength
and freedom of oil to miniature. Oliver's works are touched and re|touched
with &s;uch careful fidelity that you cannot help perceiving they
are nature in the ab&s;tract; Cooper's are &s;o bold that they &s;eem per|fect
nature only of a le&s;s &s;tandard. Magnify the former, they are &s;till
diminutively conceived: if a gla&s;s could expand Cooper's pictures to
the &s;ize of Vandyck's, they would appear to have been painted for that
proportion. If his portrait of <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This fine head is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lady Frankland, widow of Sir Tho|mas,

piece, cardinal Bentivoglio: The quick fine&s;&s;e of eye in a florid Ita|lian
writer was not a &s;ubject equal to the protector; but it would be
an amu&s;ing trial to balance Cooper's Oliver and Vandyck's lord Straf|ford.
To trace the lineaments of equal ambition, equal intrepidity,
equal art, equal pre&s;umption, and to compare the &s;kill of the ma&s;ters
in repre&s;enting the one exalted to the height of his hopes, yet perplex|ed
with a command he could &s;carce hold, did not dare to relinqui&s;h,
and yet dared to exert; the other, da&s;hed in his career, willing to
avoid the precipice, &s;earching all the rece&s;&s;es of &s;o great a &s;oul, to
break his fall, and yet ready to mount the &s;caffold with more dignity
than the other a&s;cended the throne. This parallel is not a picture
drawn by fancy; if the arti&s;ts had worked in competition, they could
not have approached nigher to the points of view in which I have
traced the characters of their heroes.</P>
<P>Cooper with &s;o much merit had two defects. His &s;kill was confi|ned
to a meer head; his drawing even of the neck and &s;houlders &s;o
incorrect and untoward, that it &s;eems to account for the numbers of
his works unfini&s;hed. It looks as if he was &s;en&s;ible how &s;mall a way
his talent extended. This very poverty accounts for the other, his
want of grace: A &s;ignal deficience in a painter of portraits&mdash;yet how
&s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed! Bounded as their province is to a few tame atti|tudes,
how grace attones for want of action! Cooper, content, like
his countrymen, with the good &s;en&s;e of truth, neglected to make
truth engaging. Grace in painting &s;eems peculiar to Italy. The
Flemings and the French run into oppo&s;ite extremes. The fir&s;t
never approach the line, the latter exceed it, and catch at mo&s;t but a
le&s;&s;er &s;pecies of it, the genteel, which if I were to define, I &s;hould call
familiar grace, as grace &s;eems an amiable degree of maje&s;ty. Cooper's
<PB N="66" REF="82">
women, like his model Vandyck's, are &s;eldom very hand&s;ome. It is
Lely alone that excu&s;es the galantries of Charles II. He painted an
apology for that A&s;iatic court.</P>
<P>The anecdotes of Cooper's life are few; nor does it &s;ignify; his
works are his hi&s;tory. He was born in 1609 and in&s;tructed, with his
brother Alexander, by their uncle Ho&s;kins, who, &s;ays Graham, was
jealous of him, and whom he &s;oon &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. The variety of tints that
he introduced, the clearne&s;s of his carnations, and loo&s;e management
of hair exceed his uncle, though in the la&s;t Ho&s;kins had great merit
too. The author I have ju&s;t quoted mentions another capital work of
Cooper, the portrait of one Swingfield, which recommended the arti&s;t
to the court of France, where he painted &s;everal pieces larger than his
u&s;ual &s;ize, and for which his widow received a pen&s;ion during her life.
He lived long in France, and Holland, and dying in London May 5, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Willett in Thames-&s;treet has a head of a young man in armour, of the family of Deane in Suffolk, not equal to mo&s;t of Cooper's works. My rea&s;on for mentioning it, is, it's being &s;et in an enamelled ca&s;e, on the out|&s;ides of which are two beautifull Madonnas, each with the child, freely painted, in a light &s;tyle: within, is likewi&s;e an enamelled land&s;cape. The picture is dated 1649. This, collated with my enamel of general Fairfax, &s;eems to corro|borate my opinion that Bordier (by whom I take the&s;e enamels to be painted) remained here after Petitot left England.</NOTE>
1672 at the age of 63 was buried in Pancras-church, where is a monu|ment
for him. The in&s;cription is in Graham, who adds that he had
great &s;kill in mu&s;ic, and played well on the lute.</P>
<P>His works are too many to be enumerated, &s;even or eight are in
queen Caroline's clo&s;et at Ken&s;ington; one of them, a head of
Moncke, is capital; but unfini&s;hed. Lord Oxford had a head of

his monument by Ry&s;brach was taken from a picture of Cooper.</P>
<P>It is an anecdote little known, I believe, and too trifling but for
&s;uch a work as this, that Pope's mother was &s;i&s;ter of Cooper's wife.
Lord Carleton had a portrait of Cooper in crayons, which Mrs. Pope
&s;aid was not very like, and which, de&s;cending to lord Burlington, was
given by his lord&s;hip to Kent. It was painted by one Jack&s;on, a re|lation
of Cooper, of whom I know nothing more, and who, I &s;up|po&s;e,
drew another head of Cooper, in crayons, in queen Caroline's
clo&s;et, &s;aid to be painted by him&s;elf; but I find no account of his e&s;|&s;ays
in that way. He did once attempt oil, as Murray the painter
told Vertue, and added, that Hayles thereupon applied to miniature,
which he threatened to continue, unle&s;s Cooper de&s;i&s;ted from oil;
which he did&mdash;but &s;uch menaces do not frighten much, unle&s;s &s;e|conded
by want of &s;ucce&s;s. Among Orinda's poems is one to Cooper
on drawing her friend Luca&s;ia's picture, in 1660.</P>
<P>RICHARD GIBSON,</P>
<P>The Dwarf, being page to a lady at Mortlack, was placed by her
with France&s;co Cleyne, to learn to draw, in which he &s;ucceeded, per|fecting
him&s;elf by copying the works of Sir Peter Lely, who drew
Gib&s;on's picture leaning on a bu&s;t, 1658, another evidence of Sir
Peter being here before the re&s;toration. It was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Mr. Ro&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He married Gib&s;on's daughter, a paintre&s;s, that will be mentioned hereafter.</NOTE> the jeweller, who had another head of the dwarf by Dob|&s;on,

pair were each three feet ten inches high. Waller has celebrated
their nuptials in one of his prettie&s;t poems. The hu&s;band was page

Gib&s;on taught queen Anne to draw, and went to Holland to in&s;truct
her &s;i&s;ter the prince&s;s of Orange. The &s;mall couple had nine chil|dren,

<P>Nephew of the preceding, was taught by him and Sir Peter Lely, and

portraits in oil, but changed that manner for crayons. His own pic|ture

died at the age of 33.</P>
<P>JOHN DIXON</P>
<P>Scholar of Sir Peter Lely, painted both in miniature and crayons, but
mo&s;tly the former. In the latter was his own head. In water-colours
there are great numbers of his works; above &s;ixty were in lord
Oxford's collection, both portraits and hi&s;tories, particularly, Diana
and her Nymphs bathing, after Polenburg, and a &s;leeping Venus,
Cupids, and a Satyr. The&s;e were his be&s;t works. He was keeper
of the king's picture-clo&s;et; and in 1698 was concerned in a bubble
Lottery. The whole &s;um was to be 40,000<HI>l.</HI> divided into 1214
prizes, the highe&s;t prize in money 3000<HI>l.</HI> the lowe&s;t 20<HI>l.</HI> One prize,
a collection of limnings, he valued &s;o highly, that the per&s;on
to whom it &s;hould fall, might, in lieu of it, receive 2000<HI>l.</HI> each
ticket twenty &s;hillings. Queen Anne, then prince&s;s, was an adven|turer.
This affair turned out ill, and Dixon, falling into debt, re|moved
for &s;ecurity from St. Martin's-lane, where he lived, to the

King's-bench-walks in the Temple, and latterly to a &s;mall e&s;tate he
had at Thwaite near Bungay in Suffolk, where he died about 1715;
and where his widow and children were living in 1725. Dixon, adds
Vertue, once bought a picture for a trifle at a broker's, which he &s;old

&s;aw &s;everal pretty large pieces after Vandyck, the fle&s;h painted very
carefully. He mentions too one Jo&s;hua Mar&s;hall, a &s;culptor, who in
1664, executed the monument of Bapti&s;t lord Noel and his lady in
Glouce&s;ter&s;hire.</P>
<P>WILLIAM HASSEL</P>

only painted in miniature but in oil, in which way he executed an oval

<P>MATTHEW SNELLING</P>
<P>A gentleman who painted in miniature, and that (being very galant)
&s;eldom but for ladies. In Mr. Ro&s;e's &s;ale 1723 was a head of Snel|ling
by Cooper 1644, finely painted, but the hands and drapery poor.
Mr. Beal mentious him in one of his pocket-books <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the next article.</NOTE>, for &s;ending pre|&s;ents
of colours to his wife in 1654, and 1658; and that in 1678,
Mr. Snelling offered him thirty guineas for a Venus and Cupid after
Rottenhamer, for which he a&s;ked forty guineas and was worth fifty. I
do not know whether this per&s;on was related to Thomas Snelling, a
poet recorded in Wood's Athenae, vol. ii. p. 135.</P>
<P>MARY BEALE</P>
<P>Was daughter of Mr. Cradock, mini&s;ter of Walton <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Where Mr. Beale afterwards erected a monument for him.</NOTE> upon Thames,
and learned the rudiments of painting from Sir Peter Lely, and had
&s;ome in&s;tructions, as Vertue thought, from Walker. She painted in
oil, water-colours and crayons, and had much bu&s;ine&s;s; her portraits
were in the Italian &s;tyle which &s;he acquired by copying &s;everal pic|tures
and drawings from Sir Peter Lely's and the royal collections.
<PB N="72" REF="90">
Her ma&s;ter was &s;uppo&s;ed to have had a tender attachment to her,
but as he was re&s;erved in communicating to her all the re&s;ources of
his pencil, it probably was a galant pa&s;&s;ion, rather than a &s;ucce&s;sful
one. Dr. Woodfall wrote &s;everal poems to her honour, under the
name of Bele&s;ia; but the fulle&s;t hi&s;tory of her life and works was re|corded
by her own hu&s;band, who in &s;mall almanac-pocket-books
minuted down almo&s;t daily accounts of whatever related to him&s;elf,
his bu&s;ine&s;s, and his wife's pictures. Of the&s;e almanacs there were
above thirty, which with mo&s;t of Mr. Beale's papers came into the
hands of Carter, colourman, to whom Beale bequeathed them. Some
were &s;old to Mr. Brooke a clergyman. His &s;hare Carter lent to a
low painter, who&s;e goods being &s;eized the pocket-books were lo&s;t, but
&s;even of them a friend of Vertue's met with on a &s;tall, bought, and
lent to him. Mo&s;t of his extracts I &s;hall now offer to the reader,
without apprehen&s;ion of their being condemned as trifling or tire&s;ome.
If they are &s;o, how will this whole work e&s;cape? When one writes
the lives of arti&s;ts, who in general were not very eminent, their
pocket-books are as important as any part of their hi&s;tory&mdash;I &s;hall
u&s;e no farther apology&mdash;if even tho&s;e that are lo&s;t &s;hould be
regretted!</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t is 1672. 20 April. Mr. Lely was here with Mr. Gib|&s;on
and Mr. Skipwith, to &s;ee us, and commended very much her
(Mrs. Beale's) coppy after our Saviour praying in the garden, &amp;c.
after Anto. da Correggio: her coppy in little after Endimion Porter
his lady and three &s;ons he commended extraordinarily, and &s;aid (to
u&s;e his own words) it was painted like Vandyke him&s;elf in little, and
that it was the be&s;t coppy he ever &s;aw of Vandyke. Al&s;o he very
well liked her two coppyes in great of Mr. Porter's little &s;on Phil. He

he and Mr. Gib&s;on both commended her works.</P>
<P>"Mr. Lely told me at the &s;ame time as he was mo&s;t &s;tudiou&s;ly

laureat, born in 1671 at his father's hou&s;e in Southampton-&s;treet

Richter; probably a copy from the former, with a &s;light variation.
What is wanting in circum&s;tances, is more than compen&s;ated by his
works. The mo&s;t capital are the two figures of melancholy and
raving madne&s;s before the front of Bedlam. The ba&s;reliefs <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A de&s;cription of them may be &s;een in the new account of London and the environs. Vol. v. p. 3.</NOTE> on two
&s;ides of the monument are by his hand too. So are the fountain in
Soho-&s;quare and one of the fine va&s;es at Hampton-court, &s;aid to be
done in competition with a foreigner who executed the other, but no|body
has told us which is Cibber's. He carved mo&s;t of the &s;tatues of
kings round the Royal-exchange, as far as king Charles, and that of
Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham in the piazza beneath. The fir&s;t duke of Devon|&s;hire
employed him much at Chat&s;worth; where two &s;phinxes on large
ba&s;es, well executed and with ornaments in good ta&s;te are of his work,
and till very lately there was a &s;tatue of Neptune in a fountain, &s;till
better. He carved there &s;everal door-ca&s;es of alaba&s;ter with rich fo|liage,
and many ornaments in the chapel; and on each &s;ide of the
altar is a &s;tatue by him, Faith and Hope; the draperies have great
<PB N="86" REF="105" MS="y">
merit, but the airs of the heads are not &s;o good as that of the Neptune.
Cibber built the Dani&s;h church in London and was buried there him|&s;elf,
with his &s;econd wife, for whom a monument was erected in 1696.
The &s;on will be known as long as the Carele&s;s Hu&s;band and the Me|moires
of his own Life exi&s;t, and &s;o long the inju&s;tice of calling the
figures at Bedlam<Q>&mdash;his brazen brainle&s;s brothers,</Q>and the peevi&s;h weakne&s;s of thru&s;ting him into the Dunciad in the

<P>Of Hanau, is mentioned in De Bie's Golden Cabinet, who &s;ays, he
was employed by the king of England to adorn his palace with works

chained together the various productions of the elements with a free
di&s;order natural to each &s;pecies: Vertue had received two different
accounts of his birth; from Murray the painter, that he was born in
Holland of Engli&s;h parents, and came over at the age of nineteen;
from Stoakes (relation of the Stones) that his father was a Dutchman,
but that Gibbons him&s;elf was born in Spur-alley in the Strand.
This is circum&s;tantial, and yet the former te&s;timony &s;eems mo&s;t true,
as Gibbons is an Engli&s;h name, and Grinling probably Dutch. He
afterwards lived, added Stoakes, in Bel&s;avage-court on Ludgate-hill,
where he carved a pot of flowers which &s;hook &s;urprizingly with the
motion of the coaches that pa&s;&s;ed by. It is certain that he was em|ployed
by Betterton on the decorations of the Theatre in Dor&s;et|garden,
where he carved the capitals, cornices and eagles. He lived
afterwards at Deptford, in the &s;ame hou&s;e with a mu&s;ician, where the
beneficent and curious Mr. Evelyn found and patronized them both.
This gentleman, Sir Peter Lely, and Bap. May, who was &s;omething
of an architect him&s;elf, recommended Gibbons to Charles II. who
though too indolent to &s;earch for genius, and too indi&s;criminate in his
bounty to confine it to merit, was always plea&s;ed, when it was
brought home to him. He gave the arti&s;t a place in the board of
works, and employed his hand on the ornaments of mo&s;t ta&s;te in his
palaces, particularly at Wind&s;or, where in the chapel the &s;implicity of
the carver's foliage at once &s;ets off and atones for the glare of Verrio's
paintings. Gibbons in gratitude made a pre&s;ent of his own bu&s;t in
wood to Mr. Evelyn who kept it at his hou&s;e in Dover-&s;treet. The
piece that had &s;truck &s;o good a judge was a large carving in wood of
St. Stephen &s;toned, long pre&s;erved in the &s;culptor's own hou&s;e, and
afterwards purcha&s;ed and placed by the duke of Chandos at Cannons.

<P>Sir Chri&s;topher Wren, of an ancient family in the Bi&s;hoprick of
Durham, was &s;on of a dean of Wind&s;or, and nephew of Matthew,
bi&s;hop, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, of Hereford, Norwich, Ely. He was born at
London in 1632, and educated at Oxford. His mathematical abili|ties
unfolded them&s;elves &s;o early, that by twenty he was elected pro|fe&s;&s;or
of a&s;tronomy at Gre&s;ham-college, and eight years afterwards
Savilian profe&s;&s;or of a&s;tronomy at Oxford. His di&s;coveries in philo|&s;ophy,
mechanics, &amp;c. contributed to the reputation of the new
e&s;tabli&s;hed Royal-&s;ociety, and his &s;kill in architecture had rai&s;ed his
own name &s;o high, that in the fir&s;t year of the Re&s;toration he was ap|pointed
coadjutor to Sir John Denham &s;urveyor of the works, whom
he &s;ucceeded in 1668. Three years before that he had vi&s;ited France&mdash;
and unfortunately went no farther&mdash;the great number of drawings

has given St. Peter's one of it's chief advantages. The exce&s;s of

The late prince of Wales, I have heard, intended to intro|duce
tombs into it, and to begin with that of his grandfather. Con|&s;idering
that We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey is over&s;tocked, and that the mo&s;t
venerable monuments of antiquity are daily removed there to make
room for modern (a precedent that one &s;hould think would di&s;courage
even the moderns from dealing with the chapter) St. Paul's would
afford a new theatre for &s;tatuaries to exert their genius&mdash;and the
Abbey would &s;till pre&s;erve it's general cu&s;tomers, by new recruits of
waxen puppets. The towers of the la&s;t mentioned fabric, and the

<P>The ROTIERS</P>
<P></P>
<P>Were a family of medalli&s;ts. The father, a gold&s;mith and banker,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted Charles II. with money during his exile, in return for which
the king promi&s;ed, if he was re&s;tored, to employ his &s;ons, who were
all gravers of &s;eals and coins. The Re&s;toration happened; and
Charles, di&s;content with the inimitable Simon, who had &s;erved Crom|well
and the Republic, &s;ent for Rotier's &s;ons. The two elde&s;t, John
and Jo&s;eph, arrived (not entirely with their father's con&s;ent who
wi&s;hed to have them &s;ettle in France, of which I &s;uppo&s;e he was a
native) They were immediately placed in the mint, and allowed a
&s;alary and a hou&s;e, where they &s;oon grew rich, being allowed 200 <HI>l.</HI>
for each broad &s;eal, and gaining 300<HI>l.</HI> a year by vending great num|bers
of medals abroad. On their &s;ucce&s;s, Philip the third brother
came over, and worked for the government too. He is the only one
of the three, though John was reckoned the be&s;t arti&s;t, who has left
his name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unle&s;s a medal which I have mentioned in the &s;econd volume of this work, p. 41. was executed by Norbert.</NOTE> or initials on any of our medals; and he it was I believe,

of a large medal with the king's head. Simon, di&s;content with
&s;ome rea&s;on at the preference of &s;uch inferior performers, made the
famous crown-piece, which though it did not explode the others, re|covered
his own &s;alary, and from that time he and his rivals lived
amicably together. It was more than they them&s;elves did. John
had three &s;ons, the elde&s;t of which he lo&s;t, but James and Norbert,
being much employed by him, their uncles grew jealous and left
England, Jo&s;eph going to France, Philip to Flanders, where each
being entertained by the re&s;pective governments, the three brothers
were at the &s;ame time in the &s;ervice of three kings, of England, France
and Spain. James Rotier being hurt by a fall from his hor&s;e, and
retiring to Bromley for the air, caught cold and died. Norbert and
his father remained working for the crown till the Revolution, when,
though offered to be continued in his po&s;t, no &s;ollicitation could pre|vail
on John the father to work for king William. This rendering
him obnoxious, and there being &s;u&s;picions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are many evidences that the&s;e and other &s;u&s;picions were not ill-founded. Rotier was believed to have both coined and furni&s;hed dies for coin|ing money, I &s;uppo&s;e with the &s;tamp and for the &s;ervice of king James. Smith in his Memoirs of &s;ecret &s;ervice mentions his information and di&s;covery of the dies in the Tower being conveyed away by one Hewet and others, by the help of Mr. Rotier, and that they were found at Mr. Vernon's in January 1695. In the Journals of the Hou&s;e of Commons, vol. xi. p. 686, is a report from the Committee to examine what dies were gone out of the Tower and by what means. From that report it appears that Rotier wou'd not &s;uffer captain Harris the patent-officer to enter the hou&s;e where the dies were kept; that one Ware made a pre&s;s for White, then under &s;entence of condemnation, who told Ware he cou'd have dies from Rotier when he plea&s;ed: that Rotier, who was a Catho|lic, kept an Iri&s;h papi&s;t in his hou&s;e, and that the lord Lucas, governor of the Tower, had complained, that the Tower was not &s;afe, while &s;o many papi&s;ts were entertained in Rotier's hou&s;e. It appears too from the Journal of Henry Earl of Clarendon, that when his lord&s;hip, who by his own account had dealt with the mo&s;t di&s;affected per&s;ons, was committed to the Tower in 1690, he a&s;ked lord Lucas to let Rotier come to him, which the governor would not &s;uf|fer him to do alone, becau&s;e he was a papi&s;t.&mdash;Lord Clarendon mo&s;t probably had another rea&s;on for de&s;iring Rotier's company.</NOTE> of his carrying on a trea|&s;onable

corre&s;pondence, guards were placed round his hou&s;e in the
Tower, and lord Lucas, who commanded there, made him &s;o unea&s;y
that he was glad to quit his habitation. He was rich and very infirm,
labouring under the &s;tone and gravel, additional rea&s;ons for his re|tiring.
He took a hou&s;e in Red-lion-&s;quare. Norbert, le&s;s difficult,
executed &s;ome things for the government, particularly, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He and his brother James &s;truck a medal of king William alone in 1693, which was adverti&s;ed, with another by them of Charles 1&s;t.</NOTE> as Vertue
thinks, the coronation medal for William and Mary, and &s;ome dies
for the copper money. On the proofs were the king's and queen's
heads on different &s;ides, with a ro&s;e, a &s;hip, &amp;c. but in 1694 it was
re&s;olved, that the heads &s;hould be coupled, and Britannia be on the
rever&s;e. Hence aro&s;e new matter of complaint&mdash;Some penetrating

This made much noi&s;e, and gave ri&s;e to a report that king James was
in England, and lay concealed in Rotier's hou&s;e in the Tower. Nor|bert

here, he certainly made &s;everal medals of the young chevalier.</P>
<P>John, the father, &s;urvived king William. A medal being ordered
of the new queen, Harris a player who &s;ucceeded Rotier, and was in|capable
of the office, employed workmen to do the bu&s;ine&s;s, among
whom was Mr. Croker, who afterwards obtained the place. Sir
Godfrey Kneller drew a profile of the queen, and Mr. Bird the &s;tatu|ary
modelled it. Her maje&s;ty did not like the e&s;&s;ay, and recollected
Rotier, but was told the family had left England or were dead. Sir
Godfrey being ordered to in&s;pect the work, and going to the Tower,
learned that John Rotier was &s;till living, whom he vi&s;ited and ac|quainted
with what had happened. The old man, in a pa&s;&s;ion, began
a die, but died before he could fini&s;h it, in 1703, and was buried in
the Tower. The unfini&s;hed die, with others of the twelve cae&s;ars,
were &s;ent to France to his relations, whence two of them arrived,
hoping to be employed. One of them modelled the face of Sir Hans
Sloane, and &s;truck a &s;ilver medal of the duke of Beaufort; but not
meeting with &s;ucce&s;s, they returned. This entire account Vertue re|ceived
in 1745 from two &s;urviving &s;i&s;ters of Norbert Rotier. Their
mother, who had a portrait of her hu&s;band John, which the daughters
&s;ent for, died in Flanders about 1720.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Arti&s;ts in the Reign of James II.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;hort and tempe&s;tuous reign of James, though he him|&s;elf
&s;eems to have had much inclination to them, afforded
&s;mall encouragement to the arts. His religion was not of a
complexion to exclude decoration; but four years, crouded with in|&s;urrections,
pro&s;ecutions, innovations, were not likely to make a figure
in a hi&s;tory of painting. Several performers, that had re&s;ided here
in the preceding reign, continued through that of James: &s;uch as may
peculiarly be a&s;cribed to his &s;hort period, I &s;hall recapitulate.</P>
<P>WILLIAM FERGUSON</P>
<P>A Scot, who lived long in Italy and France, painted &s;till life, dead
fowl, &amp;c. while in Italy he compo&s;ed two pictures, &s;old in Andrew
Hay's &s;ale, repre&s;enting ba&s;reliefs, antique &s;tones, &amp;c. on which the
light was thrown, &s;ays Vertue, in a &s;urprizing manner. His name
and the date 1679 were on them. On another was the year 1689;
<PB N="106" REF="127" MS="y">
for which rea&s;on I have placed him between the&s;e periods. He
worked very cheap and died here.</P>
<P>JACQUES ROUSSEAU <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Graham's Engli&s;h School.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>Of Paris, &s;tudied fir&s;t under Swanevelt, who had married one of his
relations, and then improved him&s;elf by a journey to Italy, practicing
&s;olely in per&s;pective, architecture and land&s;cape. On his return home
he was employed at Marly, but being a prote&s;tant, he quitted his
work on the per&s;ecution of his brethren, and retired to Swi&s;&s;erland.
Louvois invited him back; he refu&s;ed, but &s;ent his de&s;igns, and re|commended
a proper per&s;on to execute them. After a &s;hort &s;tay in
Swi&s;&s;erland, he went to Holland, whence he was invited over by
Ralph duke of Montagu to adorn his new hou&s;e in Bloom&s;bury,
where he painted much, and had the &s;upervi&s;al of the building, and
even a hand in it. His work amounted to 1500 <HI>l.</HI> in lieu of which
the duke allowed him an annuity for his life of 200 <HI>l.</HI> a year. He re|ceived
it but two years, dying <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He was buried in St. Anne's.</NOTE> in Soho-&s;quare at the age of 68 about
1694. Some of his pictures, both in land&s;cape and architecture, are
over doors at Hampton-court; and he etched after &s;ome of his own
de&s;igns. He left a widow, but bequeathed mo&s;t of what he had to
his fellow-&s;ufferers, the Refug&egrave;es. Lord Burlington had a portrait of
him by Le Fevre.</P>

The author of the Abreg&egrave; calls him <HI>Un des plus grans colori&s;tes de l'e|cole
Francoi&s;e.</HI> He might be &s;o, and not very excellent: colouring is
the point in which their be&s;t ma&s;ters have failed. La Fo&s;&s;e was in|vited
to England by the duke of Montagu, mentioned in the preced|ing
article, and painted two cielings for him, the Apotheo&s;is of I&s;is,
and an A&s;&s;embly of the Gods. The French author &s;ays that king
William pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;tay here, but that he declined the offer, in
hopes of being appointed fir&s;t painter to his own monarch. Parmen|tiere

at Montagu-hou&s;e. La Fo&s;&s;e who arrived in the reign of James, re|turned

<P>Lived about this time, and painted in the manner of Verrio, to whom
he is &s;aid to have been a&s;&s;i&s;tant. He painted a &s;tair-ca&s;e at the lord
Tyrconnel's in Arlington-&s;treet, now demoli&s;hed, and a cieling at
Bul&s;trode, in both which he placed his own portrait and name. He
was ma&s;ter of Mr. Carpenter, the &s;tatuary.</P>
<P>WILLIAM DE KEISAR,</P>
<P>Of Antwerp, was bred a jeweller, in which profe&s;&s;ion he became very
eminent, but having been well educated and taught to draw, he had a
&s;trong bent towards that profe&s;&s;ion, and employed all his lei&s;ure on it,
practicing miniature, enamel, and oil-colours, both in &s;mall and large.
Vertue &s;ays he fixed at la&s;t wholly on the former: Graham that he
<PB N="108" REF="130">
painted in little after the manner of El&s;heimer, that he imitated va|rious
manners, drew cattle and birds, and painted tombs and ba&s;re|liefs
in imitation of Vergazon, and that he worked &s;ome time with
Loten the land&s;cape-painter. This la&s;t circum&s;tance is not very pro|bable;
for Vertue, who was acquainted with his daughter, gives a
very different account of his commencing painter by profe&s;&s;ion.
Having painted &s;ome altar-pieces at Antwerp, his bu&s;ine&s;s called him
to Dunkirk, where he drew a picture for the altar of the Engli&s;h nuns.
They were &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that they per&s;uaded Kei&s;ar to go to
England, and gave him letters of recommendation to lord Melfort,
then in favour with king James. The enthu&s;ia&s;tic painter could not
re&s;i&s;t the propo&s;al; he embarked on board an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, and
without acquainting his wife or family, &s;ailed for England. His re|ception
was equal to his wi&s;hes. He was introduced to the king who
promi&s;ed to countenance him, and &s;everal per&s;ons of rank, who had
known him at Antwerp, encouraged him in his new vocation. Tran|&s;ported
with his pro&s;pect, he &s;ent for his wife, ordering her to di&s;mi&s;s
his workmen, and convert his effects into money.&mdash;Within half a year
the bubble bur&s;t; the Revolution happened, Kei&s;ar's friends could no
longer be his protectors, his bu&s;ine&s;s decrea&s;ed, and the pur&s;uit of the
Philo&s;opher's &s;tone, to which he had recour&s;e in his de&s;pair, compleated
his ruin. He died at the age of 45 in four or five years after the Re|volution.
He left a daughter whom he had taken great pains to in|&s;truct
in his favorite &s;tudy, and with &s;ucce&s;s. She painted &s;mall por|traits
in oil and copied well; but marrying one Mr. Humble a gen|tleman,
he would not permit her to follow the pro&s;e&s;&s;ion. After his
death &s;he returned to it, and died in December 1724. She had &s;eve|ral

Roma, 1687. He drew a large family-picture, of his father,
mother, a younger brother, a &s;i&s;ter and him&s;elf. Dahl gave Til&s;on

<P>THIS prince, like mo&s;t of tho&s;e in our annals, contributed
nothing to the advancement of arts. He was born in a
country where ta&s;te never flouri&s;hed, and nature had not given
it to him as an embelli&s;hment to his great qualities. He courted
Fame, but none of her mini&s;ters. Holland owed it't pre&s;ervation to
his heroic virtue, England it's liberty to his ambition, Europe it's in|dependence
to his competition with Louis the fourteenth; for, how|ever
un&s;ucce&s;sful in the conte&s;t, the very &s;truggle was &s;alutary. Being
obliged to draw all his re&s;ources from him&s;elf, and not content to ac|quire
glory by proxy, he had no lei&s;ure, like his rival, to pre&s;ide over
the regi&s;ters of his fame. He fought his own battles, in&s;tead of
choo&s;ing mottoes for the medals that recorded them; and though my

In the large piece, it is the king riding in triumph, with his u&s;ual

it. It has the freedom and nature of Vandyck, with the harmony of

<P>Sir Godfrey Kneller was born at Lubec, about the year 1648. His

of the mines and in&s;pector of count Mansfeldt's revenues. By his
wife of the family of Crow&s;en, he had one &s;on Zachary, educated at
Leip&s;ic, and for &s;ome time in the &s;ervice of Gu&s;tavus Adolphus's
widow. After her death, he removed to Lubec, married, profe&s;&s;ed
architecture, and was chief &s;urveyor to his native City. He left two
&s;ons, John Zachary, and Godfrey. The latter, who at fir&s;t was de|&s;igned
for a military life, was &s;ent to Leyden, where he applied to
mathematics and fortification; but the predominance of nature deter|mining
him to painting, his father acquie&s;ced and &s;ent him to Am&s;ter|dam,
where he &s;tudied under Bol, and had &s;ome in&s;tructions from
Rembrandt. Vertue nor any of his biographers take notice of it,
nor do I a&s;&s;ert it, but I have heard that one of his ma&s;ters was
Francis Hals. It is certain that Kneller had no &s;ervility of a di&s;ciple,
nor imitated any of them. Even in Italy whither he went in 1672,
he mimicked no peculiar &s;tyle, nor even at Venice where he re&s;ided
mo&s;t and was e&s;teemed and employed by &s;ome of the fir&s;t families,
and where he drew cardinal Ba&s;&s;adonna. If he caught any thing, it
was in&s;tructions not hints. If I &s;ee the lea&s;t re&s;emblance in his works
to any other ma&s;ter, it is in &s;ome of his earlie&s;t works in England,
and tho&s;e his be&s;t, to Tintoret. A portrait at Houghton of Jo&s;eph
Carreras, a poet and chaplain to Catherine of Li&s;bon, has the force
and &s;implicity of that ma&s;ter, without owing part of it's merit to Tin|toret's
univer&s;al black drapery, to his own, afterwards, neglected
draperies, or to his ma&s;ter Rembrandt's unnatural Chiaro Scuro.
Latterly Sir Godfrey was thought to give into the manner of Rubens;
<PB N="118" REF="143">
I &s;ee it no where but in the &s;ketch of king William's eque&s;trian figure,
evidently imitated from Rubens's de&s;ign of the cieling for the Ban|quetting-hou&s;e,
which, as I have &s;aid, in the life of that painter, was
in Kneller's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The latter had no more of Rubens's rich
colouring, than of Vandyck's delicacy in habits; but he had more
beauty than the latter, more dignity than Sir Peter Lely. The latter
felt his capacity in a memorable in&s;tance; Kneller and his brother
came to England in 1674 without intending to re&s;ide here, but to re|turn
through France to Venice. They were recommended to Mr.
Banks, a Hamburgh-merchant, and Godfrey drew him and his family.
The pictures plea&s;ed. Mr. Vernon, &s;ecretary to the duke of Mon|mouth,
&s;aw them, and &s;at to the new painter, and obtained his ma&s;|ter's
picture by the &s;ame hand. The duke was &s;o charmed, that he
engaged the king his father to &s;it to Kneller, at a time that the duke
of York had been promi&s;ed the king's picture by Lely. Charles un|willing
to have double trouble, propo&s;ed that both the arti&s;ts &s;hould
draw him at the &s;ame time. Lely as an e&s;tabli&s;hed ma&s;ter, cho&s;e the
light he liked: the &s;tranger was to draw the picture as he could; and
performed it with &s;uch facility and expedition, that his piece was in a
manner fini&s;hed, when Lely's was only dead-coloured. The novelty
plea&s;ed&mdash;yet Lely de&s;erved mo&s;t honour, for he did ju&s;tice to his
new competitor; confe&s;&s;ed his abilities and the likene&s;s. This &s;uc|ce&s;s
fixed Kneller here. The &s;eries of his portraits prove the continu|ance
of his reputation.</P>
<P>Charles II. &s;ent him to Paris to draw Louis XIV. but died in his
ab&s;ence. The &s;ucce&s;&s;or was equally favorable to him, and was &s;itting

She added, that the famous lady Dorche&s;ter advi&s;ed the queen again&s;t it, &s;aying, "Madam, if the king was to a&s;k for the portraits of all the wits in his court, wou'd not the re&s;t think he called them fools?"</NOTE> that prince he

made Pope put Kneller's vanity to the &s;tronge&s;t trial imaginable. The
former laid a wager that there was no flattery &s;o gro&s;s but his friend
would &s;wallow. To prove it, Pope &s;aid to him as he was painting,
"Sir Godfrey, I believe if God Almighty had had your a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
the world would have been formed more perfect." "Fore God, Sir,

&mdash;Ratcliffe replied peevi&s;hly, "Tell him he may do any thing with
it but paint it.&mdash;And I, an&s;wered Sir Godfrey, can take any thing
from him but phy&s;ic." Sir Godfrey at Witton acted as Ju&s;tice of
Peace, and was &s;o much more &s;wayed by Equity than Law, that his
judgments accompanied with humour are &s;aid to have occa&s;ioned tho&s;e

and accu&s;ed the butcher of having tempted him by it. Whenever Sir
Godfrey was applied to, to determine what pari&s;h a poor man belong|ed
to, he always inquired which pari&s;h was the richer, and &s;ettled the
poor man there; nor wou'd ever &s;ign a warrant to di&s;train the goods

the goodne&s;s of his heart; others, even in his capacity of ju&s;tice, his
peculiar turn; a hand&s;ome young woman came before him to &s;wear a
rape; &s;truck with her beauty, he continued examining her, as he &s;at
painting, till he had taken her likene&s;s. If he di&s;liked interruption,
he would not be interrupted. Seeing a con&s;table coming to him at
the head of a mob, he called to him, without inquiring into the af|fair;
"Mr. Con&s;table, you &s;ee that turning; go that way, and you
will find an ale-hou&s;e, the &s;ign of the king's head&mdash;go, and make
it up."</P>
<P>He married Su&s;annah Cawley, daughter of the mini&s;ter of Henley
upon Thames. She out-lived him and was buried at Henley, where
are monuments for her and her father. Before his marriage, Sir
Godfrey had an intrigue with a Quaker's wife, whom he purcha&s;ed of
her hu&s;band, and had a daughter, who&s;e portrait he drew like St. Agnes
with a lamb; there is a print of it by Smith. Kneller had ama&s;&s;ed a
great fortune, though he lived magnificently, and lo&s;t 20,000<HI>l.</HI> in the
South-&s;ea; yet he had an e&s;tate of near 2000<HI>l.</HI> a year left. Part he
bequeathed to his wife, and entailed the re&s;t on Godfrey Huckle, his
daughter's &s;on, with orders that he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the name of Knel|ler.
To three neices at Hamburgh, the children of his brother, he
left legacies; and an annuity of 100<HI>l.</HI> a year to Bing, an old &s;ervant,
who with his brother had been his A&s;&s;i&s;tants. Of the&s;e he had many,
as may be concluded from the quantity of his works, and the badne&s;s
of &s;o many. His chief performers were, Pieters, Vander Roer, and
Bakker&mdash;&s;ometimes he employed Bapti&s;t and Vergazon. His prices
were fifteen guineas for a head, twenty if with one hand, thirty for a
half, and &s;ixty for a whole length.</P>

Kneller frequently drew his own portrait; my father had one, a
head when young, and a &s;mall one of the &s;ame age, very ma&s;terly; it
is now mine. It was engraved by Becket. Another in a wig; by
Smith. A half-length &s;ent to the Tu&s;can gallery. A half-length in
a brocaded wai&s;tcoat with his gold chain; there is a mezzotinto of it,
accompanying the Kit-cat-heads. Another head with a cap; a half|length
pre&s;ented to the gallery at Oxford, and a double piece of him|&s;elf
and his wife. Great numbers of his works have been engraved,
particularly by Smith, who has more than done ju&s;tice to them; the
draperies are preferable to the originals. The fir&s;t print taken from
his works was by White of Charles II. He had an hi&s;toric piece of
his own painting before he went to Italy, Tobit and the Angel. At
his &s;eat at Witton were many of his own works, &s;old &s;ome years after
his death. He intended that Sir James Thornhill &s;hould paint the
&s;tairca&s;e there, but hearing that Sir I&s;aac Newton was &s;itting to Thorn|hill,
Kneller was offended, &s;aid, no portrait-painter &s;hould paint his
hou&s;e, and employed Laguerre.</P>
<P>Pope was not the only bard that &s;oothed this painter's vain-glory.
Dryden repaid him for a pre&s;ent of Shake&s;peare's picture with a copy
of ver&s;es full of luxuriant but immortal touches; the mo&s;t beautiful
of Addi&s;on's poetic works was addre&s;&s;ed to him: the &s;ingular happi|ne&s;s
of the allu&s;ions, and applications of fabulous theology to the prin|ces
drawn by Kneller, is very remarkable:<Q><L>Great Pan, who wont to cha&s;e the fair,</L>

<P>Prior complimented Kneller on the duke of Ormond's picture;
Steele wrote a poem to him at Witton; Tickell another; and there
is one in the third part of Mi&s;cellaneous Poems 8vo. Lond. 1693, on
the portrait of the lady Hyde. Can one wonder a man was vain, who
had been flattered by Dryden, Addi&s;on, Prior, Pope and Steele? Jo|&s;eph
Harris dedicated to him his Tragi-comedy of the Mi&s;takes or
Fal&s;e Report in 1690, in which Dryden, Tate, and Mountford had
a&s;&s;i&s;ted. And John Smith (I &s;uppo&s;e the celebrated mezzotinter) ad|dre&s;&s;ed
his tran&s;lation of Le Brun's Conference on the Pa&s;&s;ions to Sir
Godfrey. On his death was written another Poem printed in a Mi&s;|cellany
publi&s;hed by D. Lewis, 8vo. in 1726. His Brother</P>
<P>JOHN ZACHARY KNELLER,</P>
<P>Who was thirteen years older than Sir Godfrey, came to England with
him, and painted in fre&s;co, architecture, and &s;till-life, &s;mall pieces in
oil, and la&s;tly in water-colours, in which he copied &s;everal of his bro|ther's

<P><PB N="126" REF="151">JOHN BAPTIST MONOYER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Graham, and the Abreg&egrave;.</NOTE>,</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters that has appeared for painting flowers.
They are not &s;o exqui&s;itely fini&s;hed as Van Huy&s;um's, but his colour|ing
and compo&s;ition are in a bolder &s;tyle. He was born at Li&s;le in
1635, and educated at Antwerp as a painter of hi&s;tory, which he &s;oon
changed for flowers, and going to Paris in 1663 was received into the
academy with applau&s;e; and though his &s;ubjects were not thought
elevated enough to admit him to a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, he was in con&s;idera|tion
of his merit made a coun&s;ellor; a &s;illy di&s;tinction, as if a great
painter in any branch, was not &s;itter to profe&s;s that branch, than give
advice on any other. He was employed at Ver&s;ailles, Trianon, Marly,
and Meudon; and painted in the hotel de Bretonvilliers at Paris, and
other hou&s;es. The duke of Montagu brought him to England, where
much of his hand is to be &s;een, at Montagu-hou&s;e, Hampton-court,
the duke of St. Albans's at Wind&s;or, Ken&s;ington, lord Carli&s;le's, Bur|lington-hou&s;e,
&amp;c. The author of the Abreg&egrave; &s;peaking of Bapti&s;t,
La Fo&s;&s;e and Rou&s;&s;eau, &s;ays, the&s;e three French painters have extort|ed
a &s;incere confe&s;&s;ion from the Engli&s;h, "Qu'on ne peut aller plus
loin en fait de peinture." Bapti&s;t is undoubtedly capital in his way&mdash;
but they mu&s;t be ignorant Engli&s;hmen indeed, who can &s;ee any thing
ma&s;terly in the two others. Bapti&s;t pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed &s;everal times
between France and England, but having married his daughter to a
French painter who was &s;uffered to alter and touch upon his pictures,
Bapti&s;t was offended and returned to France no more. He died in
Pallmall in 1699. His &s;on Antony, called young Bapti&s;t, painted in
his father's manner, and had merit. There is a good print by White

land&s;cape and hi&s;tory-painting. He died here about 1699, at the
age of 77, and was buried at St. Giles's. His younger brother,</P>
<P>SIMON DUBOIS,</P>
<P>Was a better ma&s;ter. He lived 25 years at home, but came to
England as early as 1685, &s;everal &s;mall heads in oil being dated in
that year; they are commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the fa&s;hion of that
time, laced cravats. Portrait however was not his excellence; origi|nally
he painted battles, &s;mall, and in the Italian manner; afterwards,
hor&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He had received &s;ome in&s;tructions from Wouverman.</NOTE> and cattle, with figures, the faces of which were &s;o neatly

&s;aying &s;en&s;ibly, that &s;ince the world would not do him ju&s;tice, he
would do it him&s;elf; his works &s;old well, when his name was con|cealed.
Lord Somers di&s;tingui&s;hed better; he went unknown and
&s;at to Dubois; and going away gave him 50 guineas, ordered the
robes of chancellor, and when the picture <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">El&s;um has an epigram on this picture.</NOTE> was fini&s;hed, gave him
as much more. The two brothers lived together in Covent-garden
without any &s;ervant, working in ob&s;curity, and heaping up money,
both being avaricious. When Edward died, Simon, left without
&s;ociety, began to work for Vandevelde, and one day in a fit of gene|ro&s;ity,
offered to draw the portrait of his elde&s;t daughter. This drew
on a nearer acquaintance, and the old man married her, but died in a
year, leaving her his money, and a fine collection of pictures, and
naming his patron lord Somers executor; he was buried May 26,
1708. His young widow married again, and di&s;&s;ipated the fortune

<P>HENRY COOKE</P>
<P>Was born in 1642, and was thought to have a talent for hi&s;tory. He
went to Italy, and &s;tudied under Salvator Ro&s;a. On his return,
neither rich nor known, he lived ob&s;curely in Knave's-acre, in part|ner&s;hip
with a hou&s;e-painter. Lutterel introduced him to Sir Godfrey
Copley, who was plea&s;ed with his works, and carried him into York|&s;hire
where he was building a new hou&s;e, in which Cooke painted, and
received 150<HI>l.</HI> He then lived five years with the father of Antony
Ru&s;&s;el, whom I have mentioned in the preceding volume, but quarrel|ling
with a man about a mi&s;tre&s;s whom Cooke kept, by whom he had
children, and whom he afterwards married, Cooke killed him and
fled. He then went to Italy and &s;taid &s;even years, and returning, lived
privately, till the affair was forgot. Towards the end of his life he
was much employed. By order of King William he repaired the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Graham &s;ays he copied the Cartoons in turpentine oil, in the manner of di&s;temper, a way he invented.</NOTE>

<P>PETER BERCHETT</P>
<P>Was born in France, 1659, and beginning to draw at the age of 15
under La Fo&s;&s;e, he improved &s;o fa&s;t, that in three years he was em|ployed
in the royal palaces. He came to England in 1681, to work
under Rambour, a French painter of architecture, who, &s;ays Vertue,
was living in 1721, but then &s;taid only a year, and returned to Marli.
He came again, and painted for &s;ome per&s;ons of rank in the we&s;t.
King William building a palace at Loo, &s;ent Berchett thither, where
he was engaged fifteen months, and then came a third time to Eng|land,
where he had &s;ufficient bu&s;ine&s;s. He painted the cieling in the
chapel of Trinity-college, Oxford, the &s;tairca&s;e at the duke of Schom|berg's
in Pallmall, and the &s;ummer-hou&s;e at Ranelagh. His drawings
in the academy were much approved. Towards the end of his life,
being troubled with a pty&s;ic, he retired to Marybone and painted
only &s;mall pieces of fabulous hi&s;tory; his la&s;t was a bacchanalian, to
which he put his name the day before he died; it was in January
1720, at Marybone, where he was buried. He left a &s;on that died
&s;oon after him at the age of &s;eventeen.</P>
<P>LOUIS CHERON,</P>
<P>Born at Paris in 1660, was &s;on of Henry Cheron, an enamel painter,
<PB N="131" REF="158" MS="y">
and brother of Elizabeth Sophia Cheron, an admired paintre&s;s, and
who engraved many ancient gems. Louis went to Italy, and &s;ays the
* author of his life, "A toujours cherch&egrave; Raphael &amp; Jules Romain."
&mdash;A pur&s;uit in which he was by no means &s;ucce&s;sfull. He came to
England on account of his religion in 1695, and was employed at the
duke of Montagu's at Boughton, at Burleigh, and at Chat&s;worth,
where he painted the &s;ides of the gallery, a very poor performance.
He had before fallen into di&s;e&s;teem, when he painted at Montagu-hou&s;e,
where he was much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by Bapti&s;t, Rou&s;&s;eau and La
Fo&s;&s;e. On this ill-&s;ucce&s;s he turned to painting &s;mall hi&s;tories; but
his be&s;t employment was de&s;igning for the painters and engravers of
that time; few books appeared with plates, but from his drawings.
Vanderbank, Vandergutch, Simp&s;on, Kirkall, &amp;c. all made u&s;e of
him. His drawings are &s;aid to be preferable to his paintings. He
etched &s;everal of his own de&s;igns, as the labours of Hercules, which
were afterwards retouched with the burin by his di&s;ciple, Gerard Van|dergutch;
and towards the end of his life Cheron etched from his
own drawings a &s;uite of twenty-two &s;mall hi&s;tories for the life of
David; they were done for, or at lea&s;t afterwards purcha&s;ed by P. F.
Giffart, a book&s;eller at Paris, who applied them to a ver&s;ion of the
P&s;alms in French metre, publi&s;hed in 1715. Some time before his
death, Cheron &s;old his drawings from Raphael, and his academic
figures to the earl of Derby for a large &s;um. He was a man of a fair
character, and dying in 1713 of an apoplexy, left 20<HI>l.</HI> a year to his
maid, and the re&s;t of his fortune to his relations and to charitable u&s;es.
He was buried from his lodgings in the piazza of Covent-garden,
and lies in the great porch of that church.

<P><PB N="132" REF="159">JOHN RILEY</P>
<P>One of the be&s;t native painters that has flouri&s;hed in England, who&s;e
talents while living were ob&s;cured by the fame, rather than by the

an honour unlucky to his reputation. Graham too &s;peaks of him
with little ju&s;tice, &s;aying he had no excellence beyond a head; which
is far from true. I have &s;een both draperies and hands painted by
Riley, that would do honour to either Lely or Kneller. The portrait
of lord-keeper North at Wroxton is capital throughout. Riley, who
was humble, mode&s;t, and of an amiable character, had the greate&s;t
diffidence of him&s;elf, and was ea&s;ily di&s;gu&s;ted with his own works,
the &s;ource probably of the objections made to him. With a quarter
of Sir Godfrey's vanity, he might have per&s;uaded the world he was as
great a ma&s;ter.</P>

In 1681, they came to England, and Clo&s;terman at fir&s;t painted dra|peries
for Riley, and afterwards they painted in conjunction, Riley &s;till
executing mo&s;t of the heads. On his death Clo&s;terman fini&s;hed &s;eve|ral
of his pictures, which recommended him to the duke of Somer&s;et,
who had employed Riley. He painted the duke's children, but lo&s;t
his favour on a di&s;pute about a picture of Guercino which he had
bought for his grace, and which was afterwards purcha&s;ed by lord
Halifax; and on which occa&s;ion the duke patronized Dahl. Clo&s;ter|man
however did not want bu&s;ine&s;s. He drew Gibbons the carver
and his wife in one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a mezzotinto from it.</NOTE> piece, which plea&s;ed, and Clo&s;terman was even
&s;et in competition with Sir Godfrey. He painted the duke and
duche&s;s of Marlborough and all their children in one picture, and the
duke on hor&s;e-back, on which &s;ubject however he had &s;o many di&s;|putes
with the duche&s;s, that the duke &s;aid, "It has given me more
trouble to reconcile my wife and you, than to fight a battle." Clo&s;|terman,
who &s;ought reputation, went to Spain, where he drew the
king and queen, and from whence he wrote &s;everal letters on the pic|tures
in that country to Mr. Richard Graham. He al&s;o went twice

Saunders. El&s;um has be&s;towed an epigram on his portrait of Dryden;
yet Clo&s;terman was a very moderate performer; his colouring &s;trong,

London, and the proce&s;&s;ion at the coronation of William and Mary

of tho&s;e in his work. The &s;ub&s;tance of it is, that though born to an
e&s;tate, he could not re&s;i&s;t his impul&s;e to drawing, which made him
ramble over great part of Europe to &s;tudy painting, which he &s;carcely
ever practiced, drawing only in black and white, and carried him to
Grand Cairo, where, as he could &s;ee no pictures, I am &s;urprized he
did not take to painting. Mo&s;t of his performances were produced
over a bottle, and took root where they were born: the Mitre
Tavern at Stock's market, and the Bell at We&s;tmin&s;ter were adorned
by this jovial arti&s;t. At the former was a room called <HI>the Am&s;terdam,</HI>
from the variety of &s;ects Mr. Le Piper had painted in it, particularly
a Je&s;uit and a Quaker. One branch of his genius, that does not &s;eem
quite &s;o good humoured as the re&s;t of his character, was a talent for
caricaturas. He drew land&s;capes, etched on &s;ilver plates for the to|bacco-boxes
of his friends, and under&s;tood per&s;pective. Towards
the end of his life, his circum&s;tances were reduced enough to make
him glad of turning his abilities to &s;ome account.&mdash;Becket paid him
for de&s;igning his mezzotintos. Several heads of grand &s;igniors in &s;ir
Paul Rycaut's hi&s;tory were drawn by him, and engraved by Elder.
At la&s;t, Le Piper took to modelling in wax, and thought he could
have made a figure in it, if he had begun &s;ooner. On the death of
his mother, his fortune being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he launched again into a
cour&s;e of plea&s;ure, contracted a fever, and being bled by an ignorant
&s;urgeon who pricked an artery, he died of it in 1698, in Alderman|bury,
and was buried in the church of St. Mary Magdalen Bermond|&s;ey
in Southwark. Vertue had a large picture by Fuller, containing
the portraits of &s;everal painters and of one woman; the per&s;on in the
middle was Le Piper.

he gave his maje&s;ty the candle to hold, till the tallow ran down

the Charter-hou&s;e. Be&s;ides painting, he performed on the violin and
flute, and played at the concert held at the hou&s;e of that extraordinary

drew, one of which portraits was purcha&s;ed by Sir Hans Sloane, and
is now in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum. There is a mezzotinto from it. T.
Britton, who made much noi&s;e in his time, con&s;idering his low &s;tation
and trade, was a collector of all &s;orts of curio&s;ities, particularly draw|ings,
prints, books, manu&s;cripts on uncommon &s;ubjects, as my&s;tic
divinity, the philo&s;opher's &s;tone, judicial a&s;trology, and magic; and
mu&s;ical in&s;truments, both in and out of vogue. Various were the
opinions concerning him: Some thought his mu&s;ical a&s;&s;embly only a
cover for &s;editious meetings; others for magical purpo&s;es. He was
taken for an Athei&s;t, a Pre&s;byterian, a Je&s;uit. But Woola&s;ton the
painter and the father of a gentleman from whom I received this ac|count,
and who were both members of the mu&s;ic-club, a&s;&s;ured him
that Britton was a plain, &s;imple, hone&s;t man, who only meaned to a|mu&s;e

found the in&s;truments, and they had coffee at a penny a di&s;h. Sir

his &s;ervant-maid, obliged Bu&s;hnell to marry her. The lat|ter
in di&s;gu&s;t left England, &s;taid two years in France, and from
thence went to Italy. He lived &s;ome time at Rome and at Venice;
in the la&s;t city he made a magnificent monument for a Procuratore di
San Marco, repre&s;enting the &s;eige of Candia, and a naval engage|ment
between the Venetians and Turks. He came home through
Germany by the way of Hamburgh. Some of his fir&s;t works after
his return were the Statues of Charles I, and II, at the Royal-ex|change,
<PB N="149" REF="183">
and Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham there above &s;tairs. His be&s;t were
the kings at Temple-bar. He carved &s;everal marble monuments,
particularly one for lord A&s;hburnham in Su&s;&s;ex; one for Dr. Grew's
wife in Chri&s;t-church London, one for lord Thomond in Northamp|ton&s;hire;
Cowley's and Sir Palmes Fairborn's in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey,
and cut a head of Mr. Talman. He had agreed to compleat the &s;et

&s;uppo&s;e, Cibber) had made intere&s;t to carve &s;ome of them, Bu&s;hnell
would not proceed, though he had begun &s;ix or &s;even. Some of his
profe&s;&s;ion a&s;&s;erting that, though he was &s;killfull in drapery, he could
not execute a naked figure, he engaged in an Alexander the Great,
which &s;erved to prove that his rivals were in the right, at lea&s;t in what
he could <HI>not</HI> do. His next whim was to demon&s;trate the po&s;&s;ibility of
the Trojan hor&s;e, which he had heard treated as a fable that could not
have been put in execution. He undertook &s;uch a wooden receptacle,
and had the dimen&s;ions made in timber, intending to cover it with
&s;tucco. The head was capable of containing twelve men &s;itting
round a table; the eyes &s;erved for windows. Before it was half com|pleated,
a &s;torm of wind over&s;et and demoli&s;hed it, and though two
Vintners, who had contracted with him to u&s;e his hor&s;e as a drinking
booth, offered to be at the expence of erecting it again, he was too
much di&s;appointed to recommence. This project co&s;t him 500<HI>l.</HI>

deeper co&s;t. The&s;e &s;chemes, with the lo&s;s of an e&s;tate that he had
bought in Kent, by a law-&s;uit, quite over&s;et his di&s;ordered brain.
He died in 1701, and was buried at Paddington, leaving two &s;ons
and a daughter. The &s;ons, of whom one had 100<HI>l.</HI> a year, the other

Tyburn, which had been built by the father, but was unfini&s;hed, and

from all mankind, &s;ordid and impracticable, and &s;aying the

in plai&s;ter of Charles II. on hor&s;eback, de&s;igned to have been ca&s;t in
bra&s;s, but almo&s;t in ruins: the Alexander and the unfini&s;hed kings.

<P>THE reign of Anne &s;o illu&s;trated by heroes, poets and

&s;carce a painter of note. We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey te&s;tifies there
were no eminent &s;tatuaries. One man there was, who di&s;graced this
period by his architecture, as much as he enlivened it by his wit.
Formed to plea&s;e both Augu&s;tus, and an Egyptian monarch who
thought nothing pre&s;erved fame like a &s;olid ma&s;s of &s;tone, he
produced the Relap&s;e and Blenheim! Party, that &s;harpened the genius
of the age, di&s;honoured it too&mdash;a half-penny print of Sacheverel

Pembroke, pictures, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince George of Denmark, the queen's hu&s;band, had a collection of medals, which her maje&s;ty took in her &s;hare of his per&s;onal e&s;tate, the whole of which amounted to 37000 <HI>l.</HI> The queen had half; the re&s;t was divided among his nephews and neices, who were &s;o many, that they did not receive above 1500 <HI>l.</HI> each.

<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> PELEGRINI</P>
<P>Was brought from Venice in this reign by the duke of Manche&s;ter,
for whom he painted a &s;tairca&s;e in Arlington-&s;treet, now de&s;troyed.
He performed &s;everal works of this kind, for the duke of Portland
and lord Burlington, a &s;alon, &s;tairca&s;e, and cielings at Ca&s;tle Howard,
the &s;tairca&s;e at Kimbolton, and a hall at Sir Andrew Fountain's at
Narford in Norfolk. He made &s;everal de&s;igns for painting the dome
of St. Paul's, and was paid for them, though they were not executed,
and was cho&s;en one of the directors of the academy. He painted be|&s;ides
many &s;mall pieces of hi&s;tory, before he left England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the famous &s;y&s;tem of Mr. Lawes was &s;et on foot in France, the direc|tors, as o&s;tentatious as their apes, the South&s;ea-company, purcha&s;ed the Hotel de Nevers, and began to decorate it in the mo&s;t pompous manner. Pelegrini was in|vited from England to paint the cieling of the principal gallery, and wrote a de|&s;cription of his work&mdash;all that now remains of it; for the &s;y&s;tem bur&s;t, and the king purcha&s;ing the vi&s;ionary palace, it was converted into the Royal Library and Pelegrini's labours demoli&s;hed. France, the heathen gods, the river of Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi, religion, and all the virtues, and half the vices, as allegoric per&s;onages, with which the flatterers of the former reign had fatigued the eyes of the public, were here again re-a&s;&s;embled; and avarice and prodigality and impo&s;ture were perfumed out of the &s;ame cen&s;ers with which ambition, and vain-glory, and &s;uper&s;tition had been made drunk before.

<P><PB N="154" REF="188">MARCO RICCI, or RIZZI,</P>
<P>Who painted ruins in oil, and better in water-colours; and land|&s;torms.
He and Pelegrini di&s;agreeing, Marco went to Venice and
per&s;uaded his uncle to come over, Seba&s;tian Ricci, who had been
Pelegrini's ma&s;ter, and who was &s;oon preferred to the di&s;ciple.
Ricci's works are &s;till admired, though there is little excellence in
them; his colouring is chalky and without force. He painted the
chapel at Bul&s;trode for the duke of Portland, and in the la&s;t &s;upper
has introduced his own portrait in a modern habit. At Burlington-hou&s;e

<P><PB N="155" REF="193" MS="y">JAMES BOGDANI,</P>
<P>Was born of a genteel family in Hungary; his father, a deputy from
the &s;tates of that country to the emperor. The &s;on was not brought
up to the profe&s;&s;ion, but made con&s;iderable progre&s;s by the force of
his natural abilities. Fruit, flowers, and e&s;pecially birds were his ex|cellence.
Queen Anne be&s;poke &s;everal of his pieces, &s;till in the royal
palaces. He was a man of a gentle and fair character, and lived
between forty and fifty years in England, known at fir&s;t only by the
name of the Hungarian. He had rai&s;ed an ea&s;y fortune, but being
per&s;uaded to make it over to his &s;on, who was going to marry a re|puted
fortune, who proved no fortune at all, and other misfortunes
&s;ucceeding, poverty and &s;ickne&s;s terminated his life at his hou&s;e in
Great Queen-&s;treet. His pictures and goods were &s;old by auction at
his hou&s;e, the &s;ign of the golden eagle, in Great Queen-&s;treet, Lin|coln's-inn-fields.
His &s;on is in the board of Ordnance, and formerly

<P>WILLIAM CLARET</P>
<P>Imitated Sir Peter Lely, from whom he made many copies. There is
a print from his picture of John Egerton earl of Bridgwater, done as
early as 1680. Claret died at his hou&s;e in Lincoln's-inn-fields in
1706, and being a widower, made his hou&s;e-keeper his heire&s;s.</P>
<P>THOMAS MURRAY</P>
<P>Painted many portraits. At the Royal-&s;ociety is a picture of Dr.
Halley by him, and the earl of Halifax had one of Wycherley.
There is a mezzotinto of Murray.

</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="194">HUGH HOWARD,</P>
<P>Better known by Prior's beautiful ver&s;es to him, than by his own
works, was &s;on of Ralph Howard doctor of phy&s;ic, and was born in
Dublin Feb. 7, 1675. His father being driven from Ireland by the
troubles that followed the Revolution, brought the lad to England,
who di&s;covering a di&s;po&s;ition to the arts and Belles Lettres, was &s;ent
to travel in 1697, and on his way to Italy, pa&s;&s;ed through Holland
in the train of Thomas earl of Pembroke, one of the plenipotentiaries
at the treaty of Ry&s;wick. Mr. Howard proceeded as he had intended,
and having vi&s;ited France and Italy, returned home in October 1700.</P>
<P>Some years he pa&s;&s;ed in Dublin, but the greate&s;t and latter part of
his life he &s;pent entirely in England, practicing painting, at lea&s;t with
applau&s;e; but having ingratiated him&s;elf by his fame and knowledge
of hands with men of the fir&s;t rank, particularly the duke of Devon|&s;hire
and lord Pembroke, and by a par&s;imonious management of his
good fortune and of what he received with his wife, he was enabled to
quit the practical part of his profe&s;&s;ion for the la&s;t twenty years of his
life, the former peer having obtained for him the po&s;ts of keeper of
the &s;tate-papers and pay-ma&s;ter of his maje&s;ty's palaces. In this plea|&s;ing
&s;ituation he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with forming a large collection of
prints, books and medals, which at his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died in Pall-mall, and was buried at Richmond.</NOTE> death (March 17, 1737)
he bequeathed to his only brother Robert Howard bi&s;hop of Elphin,
who tran&s;ported them to Ireland.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard's picture was drawn by Dahl, very like, and publi&s;hed
in mezzotinto about a year before his death. Howard him&s;elf etched,
from a drawing of Carlo Maratti, a head of Padre Re&s;ta, the collector,
with his &s;pectacles on, turning over a book of drawings.

</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="195">JAMES PARMENTIER,</P>
<P>A Frenchman born in 1658, was nephew of Bourdon by whom he
was fir&s;t in&s;tructed, but his uncle dying, he came to England in 1676,
and was employed at Montagu-hou&s;e by La Fo&s;&s;e to lay his dead co|lours.
King William &s;ent Parmentier to his new palace at Loo, but
he quarrelled with Marot, the &s;urveyor of the buildings, and returned
to London, where not finding much employment, he went into York|&s;hire,
and worked &s;everal years, both in portrait and hi&s;toric paint|ing.
The altar-piece in a church at Hull, and another in St. Peter's
at Leeds, Mo&s;es receiving the law, much commended by Thore&s;by,
are of his hand. His be&s;t work was the &s;tairca&s;e at Work&s;op. To
Painter's- hall he gave the &s;tory of Diana and Endymion. On the
death of Laguerre in 1721, he returned to London, in hopes of &s;uc|ceeding
to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the latter. He died in indifferent circum|&s;tances
Dec. 2, 1730, as he was on the point of going to Am&s;terdam,
whither he had been invited by &s;ome relations. He was buried in St.
Paul's Covent-garden.</P>
<P>JOHN VANDER VAART</P>
<P>Of Harlem, came to England in 1674, and learned of Wyck the
father, but did not confine him&s;elf to land&s;cape. For &s;ome time he
painted draperies for Wi&s;&s;ing, and portraits <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He twice drew his own portrait, at the age of 30, and of 60; and one of Ker&s;eboom.</NOTE> for him&s;elf, and &s;till|life.
He was particularly famous for repre&s;entations of partridges
and dead game. In old Devon&s;hire-hou&s;e in Piccadilly he painted a
<PB N="158" REF="196" MS="y">
violin again&s;t a door, that deceived every body. When the hou&s;e was
burned, this piece was pre&s;erved and is now at Chat&s;worth. In 1713
he &s;old his collection, and got more money by mending pictures than
he did in the former part of his life by painting them. He built a
hou&s;e in Covent-garden of which pari&s;h he was an inhabitant above
fifty years. He was a man of an amiable character, and dying of a
fever in 1721 at the age of &s;eventy-four, was buried in the right|hand
i&s;le of the church of Covent-garden. Prints were taken from
&s;everal of his works; &s;ome he executed in mezzotinto him&s;elf, and
others from Wi&s;&s;ing; in which art he gave in&s;tructions to the cele|brated
John Smith. Vander Vaart, who was a batchelor, left a
nephew, Arnold, who &s;ucceeded him in the bu&s;ine&s;s of repairing
pictures.</P>
<P>RHODOLPHUS SHMUTZ</P>
<P>Was born at Ba&s;il in Swi&s;&s;erland, and in 1702 came into England,
where he painted portraits: Vertue &s;ays, "They were well-coloured,
his draperies plea&s;ant, and his women gracefull. He died in 1714,
and was buried at Pancras.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> PREUDHOMME,</P>
<P>Born at Berlin of French parents, and educated in the academy there,
went for &s;ome time to Italy, returned to Berlin and from thence came
to England in 1712, where he was much employed in copying pic|tures,
and making drawings in chalk from Italian ma&s;ters for engra|vers.
There was a de&s;ign of engraving a &s;et of prints from all the
<PB N="159" REF="197" MS="y">
be&s;t pictures in this country, and Preudhomme went to Wilton with
that view, where, after an irregular life, he died in 1726 at the age
of forty. He had contracted a French &s;tyle in his pictures from his
ma&s;ter Mon&s;ieur Pe&s;ne.</P>
<P>Colonel SEYMOUR,</P>
<P>Nearly related to the pre&s;ent duke of Somer&s;et and the earl of Hert|ford,
had &s;ome fine pictures, and painted in water-colours and cray|ons.
In the latter he copied from Cooper a head of Sir John Robin|&s;on
lieutenant of the Tower. He al&s;o drew many hi&s;toric heads, and
portraits with a pen. He lived in the hou&s;e in Hyde-park at the end
of Ken&s;ington-garden.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> BOIT,</P>
<P>Well-known for his portraits in enamel, in which manner he has
never perhaps been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed but by his predece&s;&s;or Petitot, and his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or Zincke. Before I give an account of him, I mu&s;t premi&s;e
that I do not an&s;wer for the truth of &s;ome parts of his &s;tory, which
to me &s;eem a little incredible. I give them as I find them in two dif|ferent
MSS. of Vertue, who names his authors, Peter&s;on, a &s;cholar
of Boit and another per&s;on. Vertue was incapable of fal&s;hood&mdash;per|haps
he was too credulous.</P>
<P>Boit, who&s;e father was a Frenchman, was born at Stockholm, and
bred a jeweller, which profe&s;&s;ion he intended to follow here in Eng|land,
but changed for painting, but was upon &s;o low a foot, that he
went into the country, and taught children to draw. There he had
engaged one of his &s;cholars, a gentleman's daughter to marry him,
<PB N="160" REF="198">
but the affair being di&s;covered, Boit was thrown <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An act of tyranny, as the affair was not compleat, nor was there then a marriage-act.</NOTE> into pri&s;on. In
that confinement, which la&s;ted two years, he &s;tudied enamelling; an
art to which he fixed on his return to London, and practiced with the
greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s: Dahl chiefly recommended him. His prices are not
to be believed. For a copy of colonel Seymour's picture by Kneller,
he had thirty guineas; for a lady's head not larger, double that &s;um,
and for a few plates 500 <HI>l.</HI> If this appears enormous, what will the
reader think of the following anecdote? He was to paint a large plate
of the queen, prince George, the principal officers and ladies of the
court, and Victory introducing the duke of Marlborough and prince
Eugene; France and Bavaria pro&s;trate on the ground; &s;tandards,
arms, trophies. The &s;ize of the plate to be from 24 to 22 inches
high, by 16 to 18 inches wide. Laguerre actually painted the de&s;ign
for it in oil. Prince George, who earne&s;tly patronized the work, pro|cured
an advance of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> to Boit, who took a &s;pot of ground in
May-fair, and erected a furnace, and built convenient rooms adjoyn|ing
to work in. He made &s;everal e&s;&s;ays before he could even lay the
enamelled ground, the heat nece&s;&s;ary being &s;o inten&s;e that it mu&s;t cal|cine
as much in a few hours, as furnaces in gla&s;s-hou&s;es do in 24 hours.
In the&s;e attempts he wa&s;ted &s;even or eight hundred pounds. In the mean
time the prince, who had often vi&s;ited the operation, died. This put
a &s;top to the work for &s;ome time; Boit however began to lay colours
on the plate; but demanded and obtained 700 <HI>l.</HI> more. This made
con&s;iderable noi&s;e, during which happened the revolution at court,
extending it&s;elf even to Boit's work. Their graces of Marlborough
were to be di&s;placed even in the enamel, and her maje&s;ty ordered Boit,
<PB N="161" REF="199">
to introduce Peace and Ormond, in&s;tead of Victory and Churchill.
The&s;e alterations were made in the &s;ketch, which had not been in the
fire, and remained &s;o in Peter&s;on's hands, when he related the &s;tory to
Vertue. Prince Eugene refu&s;ed to &s;it. The queen died. Boit ran
in debt, his goods were &s;eized by execution, and he fled to France;
where he changed his religion, was countenanced by the regent, ob|tained
a pen&s;ion of 250 <HI>l.</HI> per ann. and an apartment, and was much
admired in a country where they had &s;een no enameller &s;ince Petitot.
Boit died &s;uddenly at Paris, about Chri&s;tmas 1726. Though he never
executed the large piece in que&s;tion, there is one at Ken&s;ington of a
con&s;iderable &s;ize, repre&s;enting queen Anne &s;itting, and prince George
&s;tanding by her. At Bedford-hou&s;e is another very large plate of the
duke's father and mother. I have a good copy by him of the Venus,
Cupid, Satyr and Nymphs, by Luca Jordano at Devon&s;hire-hou&s;e,
and a fine head of admiral Churchill; and mi&s;s Reade, the paintre&s;s,
has a very fine head of Boit's own daughter, enamelled by him from
a picture of Dahl. This daughter was married to Mr. Graham,
apothecary, in Poland-&s;treet.</P>
<P>LEWIS CROSSE,</P>
<P>A painter in water-colours, who is not to be confounded with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is Michael Cro&s;&s;e, of whom there is an account in Graham.</NOTE> Mi|chael
Cro&s;&s;e or De La Crux, whom I have mentioned in the reign of
Charles I. Lewis Cro&s;&s;e painted &s;everal portraits in miniature in
queen Anne's time, many of which are in the collection of the duche&s;s
of Portland, the counte&s;s of Cardigan, &amp;c. This Cro&s;&s;e repaired a
little picture of the queen of Scots in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of duke Hamilton,
<PB N="162" REF="200" MS="y">
and was ordered to make it as hand&s;ome as he could. It &s;eems, a
round face was his idea of perfect beauty, but it happened not to be
Mary's &s;ort of beauty. However, it was believed a genuine picture,
and innumerable copies were made from it. It is the head in black
velvet trimmed with ermine. Cro&s;&s;e had a valuable collection of mi|niatures,
the works of Peter Oliver, Ho&s;kins and Cooper. Among
them was a fine picture of a lady Sunderland by the latter, his own
wife, and a head almo&s;t profile in crayons of Ho&s;kins; a great curio|&s;ity,
as I neither know of any other portrait of that ma&s;ter, nor where
the picture it&s;elf is now. That collection was &s;old at his hou&s;e the
&s;ign of the blue anchor in Henrietta-&s;treet Covent-garden Dec. 5,
1722, and Cro&s;&s;e died in October 1724.</P>
<P>Statuary in this reign, and for &s;ome years afterwards, was in a
manner monopolized by</P>
<P>FRANCIS BIRD.</P>
<P>The many public works by his hand, which in&s;pire nobody with a
curio&s;ity of knowing the arti&s;t, are not good te&s;timonies in his favour.
He was born in Piccadilly 1667, and &s;ent at eleven years of age to
Bru&s;&s;els, where he learned the rudiments of his art from one Cozins,
who had been in England. From Flanders he went to Rome, and
&s;tudied under Le Gros. At nineteen, &s;carce remembring his own
language, he came home, and worked fir&s;t for Gibbons, then for Cib|ber.
He took <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e two journies, it is &s;aid, he performed on foot.</NOTE> another &s;hort journey to Italy, and at his return &s;et up
for him&s;elf. The performance that rai&s;ed his reputation, was the
<PB N="163" REF="201">
monument of Bu&s;by. The latter had never permitted his picture to
be drawn. The moment he was dead, his friends had a ca&s;t in plai&s;|ter
taken from his face, and thence a drawing in crayons, from which
White engraved his print, and Bird carved his image. His other
principal works, which are all I find of his hi&s;tory, were,</P>
<P>The conver&s;ion of St. Paul in the pediment of that cathedral. Any
&s;tatuary was good enough for an ornament of that height, and a great
&s;tatuary had been too good.</P>
<P>The ba&s;-reliefs under the portico.</P>
<P>The &s;tatue of queen Anne, and the four figures round the pede&s;tal,
before the &s;ame church. The author of the Abreg&egrave;, &s;peaking of
Engli&s;h arti&s;ts, &s;ays, "&agrave; l'egard de la &s;culpture, le marbre gemit pour

of queen Anne, we may pardon the &s;culptor who occa&s;ioned it, as it
gave ri&s;e to another &s;atire, tho&s;e admirable lines of Dr. Garth.</P>
<P>The &s;tatue of cardinal Wol&s;ey at Chri&s;t-church.</P>
<P>The brazen figure of Henry VI. at Eton-college&mdash;a wretched

<P>A magnificent monument in Fulham-church for the lord vi&s;count
Mordaunt. Bird received 250<HI>l.</HI> for his part of the &s;culpture.</P>
<P>The &s;umptuous monument of the la&s;t duke of Newca&s;tle in We&s;t|min&s;ter-abbey,

wanted ta&s;te, is not extraordinary. That he &s;hould have been &s;elected
to rai&s;e a palace <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The duche&s;s quarrelled with Sir John and went to law with him, but though he proved to be in the right, or rather <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he proved to be in the right, &s;he employed Sir Chri&s;topher Wren to build the hou&s;e in St. James's-park.</NOTE>, built at the public expence, for the hero of his
country, &s;urpri&s;es one. Who&s;e thought it was to load every avenue to
that palace with in&s;criptions, I do not know; altogether, they form
an edition of the acts of parliament in &s;tone. However partial the
court was to Vanbrugh, every body was not &s;o blind to his defects.
Swift ridiculed both his own diminutive hou&s;e at Whitehall, and the

<P>Thus far the &s;atyri&s;t was well founded; party-rage warped his un|der&s;tanding,
when he cen&s;ured Vanbrugh's plays, and left him no
more judgment to &s;ee their beauties, than Sir John had, when he
perceived not that they were the only beauties he was formed to com|po&s;e.
Nor is any thing &s;illier than Swift's pun on Vanbrugh's being
Clarenceux-herald, which the dean &s;uppo&s;es enabled him <HI>to build
hou&s;es.</HI> Sir John him&s;elf had not a wor&s;e rea&s;on for being an archi|tect.

<P>The&s;e invectives perhaps put a &s;top to Vanbrugh's being employed
on any more buildings for the crown, though he was &s;urveyor of the
works at Greenwich, comptroller general of the works, and &s;urveyor
of the gardens and waters. His other de&s;igns were,</P>

If Vanbrugh had borrowed from Vitruvius as happily as from
Dancour, Inigo Jones <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inigo Jones imitated the ta&s;te of the antique, but did not copy it &s;o &s;ervilely as Palladio. Lord Burlington, who had exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, was a little too fearful of deviating from his models. Raphael, Michael Angelo, Vignola, Bernini, and the be&s;t Italian architects, have dare to invent, when it was in the &s;pirit of the &s;tandard. Perhaps there could not be a more beautiful work, than a volume collected and engraved from the buildings and hints of buildings in the pictures of Raphael, Albano, Pietr&ograve; Cortona, and Nicol&ograve; Pou&s;&s;in. It is &s;urprizing that Raphael's works in this manner have not been a&s;&s;embled. Be&s;ides thoughts in his paintings, he executed &s;everal real buildings of the true&s;t delicacy.</NOTE> would not be the fir&s;t architect of Britain.</P>
<P>Sir John Vanbrugh died at Whitehall March 26, 1726. In his

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The following &s;light notices relating to arti&s;ts who have
worked for the Engli&s;h but came not to England, or
who are cur&s;orily mentioned to have been here, are
extracted from De&s;camps.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HUBERT JACOBS,</HI> of Delft, painted portraits of &s;everal
Engli&s;h; and it is pretended that to &s;atisfy their natural im|patience,
he formed a ha&s;ty manner that prejudiced his works and
reputation. Vol. ii. p. 36.</P>
<P><HI>John David de Heem,</HI> of Utrecht, a celebrated painter of flowers,
had &s;old a capital piece to Vander Meer, another painter, for 2000
florins. Vander Meer being plundered by &s;ome troops, had no re|&s;ource
but in pre&s;enting that curio&s;ity to king William, having in|&s;erted
the monarch's head in the garland. The king brought it to
England, having be&s;towed a lucrative employment on the donor.
Vol. ii. p. 39.</P>
<P><HI>Henry Pot,</HI> of Harlem, drew the portraits of the king and queen
of England, and of the principal nobility&mdash;at what time is not &s;pe|cified&mdash;probably
they were Charles II, and his mother, &amp;c. during
their exile. Ib. 43.</P>
<P><PB REF="208" MS="y">
<HI>John Lievens,</HI> born at Leyden in 1607, was an admired painter of
portraits. The prince of Orange pre&s;ented to the Engli&s;h emba&s;&s;ador
(who gave it to the king) the picture of a &s;tudent &s;itting by the fire,
which plea&s;ed &s;o much that Lievens came to England on the credit of
it, drew mo&s;t of the royal family and many of the nobility, though
then but 24, (it was in 1630) and &s;taid here three years. This is all
the account I find of this painter in England, nor do I know any of
his works here; yet the tradition is confirmed by a MS. catalogue of
king Charles's pictures, in which are named, the &s;tudent; portraits
of the prince and prince&s;s; and a &s;alutation of the virgin. De&s;camps,
vol. ii. p. 117.</P>
<P><HI>Palamedes Stevens,</HI> according to De&s;camps, is &s;till more our own,
having been born at London in 1607, though he never practiced
here. His father, an eminent &s;culptor of Delft, was celebrated for
carving va&s;es in porphyry, agate, ja&s;per, and other precious materials,
and was invited to England by James I, where the &s;on was born,
&s;oon after which he was carried by his father to Holland, and died at
the age of 31. Ib. p. 118.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas de Helt&s;tokade,</HI> of Nimeguen, painted the king of England.
I &s;uppo&s;e, Charles II. Ib. p. 112.</P>
<P>The directors of the Dutch Ea&s;t-india-company gave 4000 florins
for a picture of Gerard Dow, repre&s;enting a woman with an infant
on her lap, playing with a little girl; they pre&s;ented it to Charles II.
on his re&s;toration; king William carried it back to Loo. Ib. 221.</P>
<P><HI>Giles Schagen,</HI> of Alcmaer, was a great copyi&s;t, and painted por|traits
and &s;ea-pieces. He was born in 1616, and De&s;camps &s;ays, he
was in England. Ib. 253.</P>
<P>King William gave 900 florins for a picture by <HI>Mary Van Oo&s;ter|wyck.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="209" MS="y">
<HI>John Henry Roos,</HI> born at Otterburg in the lower Palatinate in 1631,
was a painter of land&s;cape and animals, and, according to De&s;camps,
came into England; but probably &s;taid here very little time.</P>
<P><HI>William Sckellinks,</HI> according to the foregoing authority, was here
too, but &s;taid as little. He painted in Holland the embarkation of
Charles II, at the re&s;toration, which was reckoned his capital work.</P>
<P><HI>John de Baan,</HI> born at Harlem 1633, became &s;o con&s;iderable a
portrait-painter that on his arrival in England, Lely, who if De&s;camps
were to be credited, was the mo&s;t jealous of his profe&s;&s;ion, (which is
a pa&s;&s;ion more likely to be felt by the wor&s;t arti&s;ts than by the be&s;t)
was exceedingly glad that De Baan returned &s;oon to the Hague. He
frequently drew king William and queen Mary, and painted king
James in his pa&s;&s;age through Holland. John de Baan died in 1702.</P>
<P>That neat and curious painter <HI>Vander Heyden</HI> was probably in
England, for De&s;camps (vol. iii. p. 49.) mentions a view of the
Royal-exchange by him.</P>
<P><HI>Franci&s;co Mil&egrave;</HI> was here, but made no &s;tay.</P>
<P><HI>Robert du Val,</HI> who had been employed by king William at Loo,
was &s;ent over to clean the Cartoons, and place them in Hampton-court.
See his Life in De&s;camps, vol. iii. p. 172.</P>
<P><HI>John Van Hugtenburch,</HI> of Harlem, was employed by prince Eugene
to paint his battles, and had a &s;hare in the de&s;igns for the triumphal
tape&s;try at Blenheim.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;tine Terwe&s;ten,</HI> of the Hague, born in 1649, vi&s;ited England
in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies.</P>
<P><HI>John Vander Spriet,</HI> of Delft, painter of portraits, died at London.
He is quite unknown. V. De&s;camps, vol. iii. p. 261.</P>
<P><HI>Simon Vander Does,</HI> &s;taid here but a very &s;hort time.</P>
