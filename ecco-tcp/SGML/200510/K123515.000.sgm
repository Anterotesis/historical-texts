<HEAD>PREFACE,
To all that are concerned in the
EDUCATION of CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is an awful and important
Charge that is committed
to you. The Wi&s;dom and
Welfare of the &s;ucceeding Generation
are intru&s;ted with you beforehand, and
depend much on your Conduct. The
Seeds of Mi&s;ery or Happine&s;s in this
World, and that to come are often|times
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
&s;own very early; and therefore
whatever may conduce to give the
Minds of Children a Reli&s;h for Vir|tue
and Religion, ought, in the fir&s;t
Place, to be propo&s;ed to you.</P>
<P>VERSE was at fir&s;t de&s;igned for the
Service of GOD, though it hath been
wretchedly abu&s;ed &s;ince. The Ancients,
among the Jews and the Heathens,
taught their Children and Di&s;ciples the
Precepts of Morality and Wor&s;hip in
Ver&s;e. The Children of I&s;rael were
commanded to learn the Words of the
Song of Mo&s;es, <HI>Deut. xxxi.</HI> 19, 30. and
we are directed in the New Te&s;tament,
not only to &s;ing <HI>with Grace in the Heart,</HI>
but to <HI>teach, and admoni&s;h one another
by Hymns and Songs,</HI> Ephes. v. 19. And
there are the&s;e four Advantages in it.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="vii" REF="5">
I. THERE is a great Delight in the
very learning of Truths and Duties this
Way. There is &s;omething &s;o amu&s;ing
and entertaining in Rhymes and Metre,
that will incline Children to make this
Part of their Bu&s;ine&s;s a Diver&s;ion. And
you may turn their very Duty into a
Reward, by giving them the Privilege
of learning one of the&s;e SONGS every
Week, if they fulfil the Bu&s;ine&s;s of
the Week well, and promi&s;ing them
the Book it&s;elf, when they have learnt
ten or twenty Songs out of it.</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT is learnt in Ver&s;e, is
longer retained in Memory, and &s;ooner
recollected. The like Sounds, and the
like Number of Syllables, exceedingly
a&s;&s;i&s;t the Remembrance. And it may
often happen, that the End of a Song
running in the Mind, may be an ef|fectual
means to keep off &s;ome Tempta|tions,
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
or to incline to &s;ome Duty, when
a Word of Scripture is not upon their
Thoughts.</P>
<P N="3">III. THIS will be a con&s;tant Furni|ture
for the Minds of Children, that
they may have &s;omething to think
upon when alone, and &s;ing over to
them&s;elves. This may &s;ometimes give
their Thoughts a divine Turn, and
rai&s;e a young Meditation. Thus they
will not be forced to &s;eek Relief for an
Emptine&s;s of Mind, out of the loo&s;e
and dangerous Sonnets of the Age.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THESE <HI>Divine Songs</HI> may be a
plea&s;ant and proper Matter for their
Daily or Weekly Wor&s;hip, to &s;ing one
in the Family, at &s;uch Time as the
Parents or Governors &s;hall appoint;
and therefore I have confined the Ver&s;e
to the mo&s;t u&s;ual P&s;alm Tunes.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="7">
THE greate&s;t part of this little Book
was compo&s;ed &s;everal Years ago, at the
Reque&s;t of a Friend, who has been
long engaged in the Work of Cate|chi&s;ing
a very great Number of Chil|dren
of all kinds, and with abundant
Skill and Succe&s;s. So that you will
find here nothing that &s;avours of a
Party: The Children of high and low
Degree, of the Church of England, or
Di&s;&s;enters, bapti&s;ed in Infancy, or not,
may all join together in the&s;e Songs.
And as I have endeavoured to &s;ink the
Language to the Level of a Child's Un|der&s;tanding,
and yet to keep it, if po&s;|&s;ible,
above Contempt; &s;o I have de|&s;igned
to profit all, if po&s;&s;ible, and of|fend
none. I hope the more general
the Sen&s;e is, the&s;e Compo&s;ures may be
of the more univer&s;al U&s;e and Service.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="8">
I HAVE added at the End, &s;ome
Attempts of SONNETS on MORAL
SUBJECTS, for Children, with an Air
of Plea&s;antry, to provoke &s;ome fitter
Pen to write a little Book of them.</P>
<P>MAY the Almighty GOD make you
faithful in this important Work of Edu|cation;
may he &s;ucceed your Cares
with his abundant Grace, that the
ri&s;ing Generation of Great Britain may
be a Glory among the Nations, a Pat|tern
to the Chri&s;tian World, and a
Ble&s;&s;ing to the Earth.</P>
