<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THESE lines are &s;acred to the memory
of ONE who, not &s;atisfied with the at|tainment
of every female excellence, and every
human virtue, &s;oared, on adventurous wing,
into the regions of &s;cience and philo&s;ophy. She
&s;ucce&s;sfully rivalled tho&s;e who have long been
accu&s;tomed to behold with <HI>indifference,</HI> if not
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
with <HI>contempt,</HI> the efforts of feminine genius,
when either cla&s;&s;ical learning or philo&s;ophical
di&s;qui&s;ition have been the objects of pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>ALIKE di&s;tingui&s;hed by elegance of manners,
by brilliancy of imagination, and &s;oundne&s;s of
judgment, it is almo&s;t needle&s;s to ob&s;erve that,
whil&s;t living, &s;he commanded the e&s;teem and
admiration of all who were &s;o fortunate as
to rank in the number of her friends, and who
now join in &s;incerely regretting that Heaven,
has for ever veiled from their eyes, ONE who&s;e
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
beauty, wit, and virtue, adorned a &s;ex that has
&s;eldom, if ever produced her &s;uperior.</P>
<P>IT is with ju&s;t diffidence that the&s;e lines are
now &s;ubmitted to the public in&s;pection. The
Author had withheld them from the pre&s;s in
expectation that &s;ome abler bard would tune
the lyre to the memory of his lamented friend.
Encouraged however by the reception of a
former work, he once more ventures him&s;elf as
a candidate for public approbation; convinced
that if it be merited, it will not be withheld.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="7">
IN the Elegy he has expre&s;&s;ed his hopes that
the poetical powers of Mr. Graves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ingenious author of Euphro&s;yne, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>, the elegant

once more be exerted in paying a worthy tribute
to her memory. Should the peru&s;al of the&s;e
lines &s;ugge&s;t to that accompli&s;hed &s;cholar, the
idea of favouring the world with a fre&s;h &s;pecimen
of his poetical talents, the Author will have the
&s;atisfaction of knowing that, however little his
own performance may have merited the <HI>indulgence</HI>
of the public, it will have given birth to one,
<PB N="xi" REF="8">
that will challenge univer&s;al <HI>applau&s;e,</HI> and perpe|tuate
the virtues of his amiable and accom|pli&s;hed
friend&mdash;to whom, alas! he now bids a
reluctant adieu in the words of Milton:
