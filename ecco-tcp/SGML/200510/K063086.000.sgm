<HEAD>ADVICE
TO THE
Tories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Wickedne&s;s of the
Times hath been a ju&s;t
Complaint in all Ages,
Pa&s;&s;ion having been ever
powerful and on the &s;ide
of Vice, which is the great|e&s;t
Enemy to Religion. But in the pre|&s;ent
Age, Vice and Sceptici&s;m join their
Forces to de&s;troy Chri&s;tianity. If Men
were wicked in former Times, their
Wickedne&s;s was attended with Remor&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="4">
and Shame. But now they are openly
and couragiou&s;ly wicked, being &s;o upon
Principle, and endeavouring to &s;upport
them&s;elves by Argument, and by the ge|neral
Example of the Age. Whatever
may occa&s;ion this Growth of Impiety,
the Zeal you at all Times expre&s;s for
the Church, encourages me to think
your Endeavours will not be wanting to
put a Stop to it: At lea&s;t, it is to be
hoped, that you will avoid being your
&s;elves in&s;trumental to the propagating &s;o
great an Evil.</P>
<P>Two Things there are which influence
Men with a Regard for Religion; a
Sen&s;e of its <HI>Truth,</HI> and a Sen&s;e of its
<HI>U&s;efulne&s;s.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e can affect
tho&s;e alone who are really Chri&s;tians:
The latter may have a more exten&s;ive
Influence, and cau&s;e even Infidels to pay
an outward Re&s;pect to that whereon
they apprehend the common Welfare to
depend. In proportion as you le&s;&s;en ei|ther
of the&s;e Motives, you do a manife&s;t
Di&s;&s;ervice to Religion. But your being
at any Time guilty of Sedition or Re|bellion
again&s;t that Sovereign to whom
you have &s;worn Allegiance, will very
<PB N="7" REF="5">
much contribute to make both lo&s;e their
Force upon the Minds of Men. For, If
the Chri&s;tian Religion doth not re&s;train
Men from wicked Actions, &s;uch as
Fraud, Violence, Perjury, and the like,
how is it u&s;eful to Mankind? Or if it
doth, how can you pretend to believe
it, and at the &s;ame Time act in direct
Oppo&s;ition to its Precepts? And what
Thoughts will other Men be tempted
to have of Religion, when its great
A&s;&s;ertors &s;hall &s;hew them&s;elves to be|lieve
nothing of what they a&s;&s;ert?</P>
<P>I have neither &s;o ill an Opinion of
you, nor &s;o good a one of your Ad|ver&s;aries,
as to believe every Thing
which they report to your Di&s;advan|tage.
But as it is now the general
Di&s;cour&s;e and Su&s;picion, that many of
you, who are bound by the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn
Oaths to be true and faithful
Subjects to King <HI>George,</HI> do neverthe|le&s;s,
contrary to tho&s;e Oaths, endeavour
to undermine his Government, and in|troduce
that of the Per&s;on whom you
have abjured; I thought it my Duty
to di&s;&s;uade you from &s;o infamous a
Practice, not with any Intention to fix
<PB N="8" REF="6">
the Scandal, but to remove the Cau&s;e
of it, if there be any on your Side;
or, if there be not, to prevent your
being provoked to de&s;erve it by the
unmerited Cen&s;ures and Reproaches of
your Enemies.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e among you, who remain firm
to the Allegiance you have &s;worn, cannot
be di&s;plea&s;ed that I endeavour to make
others like your &s;elves: And if this
Paper fall into the Hands of any who
have betrayed Faith, Honour and Reli|gion,
their own Con&s;cience will be the
be&s;t Ju&s;tification for the making it Pub|lick;
I &s;hall, therefore, not as a Po|litician,
who is carrying on a private
Scheme for the Intere&s;t of any Prince
or Mini&s;try, but as a Chri&s;tian, who in|tends
the Advancement and Honour of
Religion, proceed to lay before you the
ill Con&s;equences, which the Violation of
your Oaths is like to have upon that
Church for who&s;e Intere&s;t you profe&s;s
&s;o great Concern.</P>
<P>It is plain then, that the publick and
avowed Breach of your Oaths would
prove the greate&s;t Injury to the Church,
<PB N="9" REF="7">
ina&s;much as it would be de&s;tructive of
all Religion. If Oaths are no longer
to be e&s;teemed &s;acred, what &s;ufficient
Re&s;traint can be found for the irregular
Inclinations of Men? Common mutual
Faith is the great Support of Society;
and an Oath, as it is the highe&s;t Obli|gation
to keep our Faith inviolate, be|comes
the great In&s;trument of Ju&s;tice
and Intercour&s;e between Men. What|ever,
therefore, le&s;&s;ens the Sacredne&s;s
or Authority of an Oath mu&s;t be acknow|ledged
at the &s;ame time to be highly
detrimental both to the Church and the
Commonwealth.</P>
<P>Men, by concealing other Crimes, may
prevent the Scandal of them; but the
Perjury of tho&s;e who &s;hould attempt to
&s;ubvert the Government is an avowed
and open Crime. Other Crimes may
admit of &s;ome Diminution, either on
Account of the Incon&s;iderablene&s;s of
their Object, or the Infirmity which at|tends
the Commi&s;&s;ion of them: But
this is a Crime of the highe&s;t Nature,
not only as it affects the Per&s;on of the
Prince under who&s;e Protection we live,
but as it is in a peculiar Manner, above
<PB N="10" REF="8">
other Crimes, an In&s;ult on the Deity it
&s;elf. State-Perjury doth not &s;pring from
a &s;udden Gu&s;t of Pa&s;&s;ion; it is no &s;en&s;ual
Vice to which you are &s;timulated by the
Frailty of the Fle&s;h. It is a cool, deli|berate
Crime, and &s;heweth a &s;tedfa&s;t
Re&s;olution to do Evil without Regard
either to God or Man.</P>
<P>It may, indeed, &s;eem needle&s;s to u&s;e
any more Arguments in order to con|vince
you, either that the Cau&s;e of Vir|tue
and Religion is likely to &s;uffer by the
common Practice of Perjury and Breach
of Faith, or that the Intere&s;t of the
Church is in&s;eparable from the Intere&s;t
of Religion. But I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t further
on a Point which, how clear &s;oever, is
not much attended to. It cannot be de|nied,
that the vi&s;ible Intere&s;t of the
Church depends upon her Credit and
Reputation; which Men will be apt to
mea&s;ure by the Reputation of tho&s;e who
&s;tand up mo&s;t zealou&s;ly in her Defence.
If therefore you, who would be thought
true Sons of the Church, and warm A&s;|&s;ertors
of her Priviledges, &s;hould lo&s;e
your own Credit by Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and
Perjury, how great a Blemi&s;h will you
<PB N="11" REF="9">
throw upon her? How mu&s;t the Ho|nour
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;ink in
the Opinion of tho&s;e among us, who
are already <HI>hardly Chri&s;tians,</HI> when they
&s;ee the ba&s;e&s;t Immoralities practi&s;ed to
promote her Intere&s;t? There are too
many who cannot or will not be at
the Pains to inquire into the Merits of
the Cau&s;e; but, judging only by Appear|ances,
will, from the Lives of Church|men,
form their Idea of the Church it
&s;elf. Con&s;ider therefore what Scandal
you give, and how far you participate
the Guilt of the&s;e Men, whom you en|courage
and harden in their Contempt
of the Church, by making her a Pretext
for Hypocri&s;y and Prevarication.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, you are to reflect that the
Ills of Rebellion are certain, but the
Event doubtful: And con&s;idering the
Di&s;advantages the Rebels mu&s;t lie under,
you ought in Rea&s;on to apprehend the
wor&s;t. In ca&s;e therefore of a Defeat,
what Quarter are you to expect, I will
not &s;ay for your &s;elves, but for that
Church who&s;e Intere&s;t you pretend to
interweave with your own? One Thing
is evident, that if the Rulers among
<PB N="12" REF="10">
the Whigs are, what by many of
you they are repre&s;ented to be, di&s;|affected
to the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
they will then have the faire&s;t Pretext,
as well as Opportunity, to de&s;troy
her. It may be thought nece&s;&s;ary to
bind tho&s;e who call them&s;elves the
<HI>Church-Party</HI> with &s;omething &s;tronger
than Oaths.</P>
<Q>Dicta nihil metuere nihil perjuria curant.</Q>
<P>And with the &s;ame Iniquity that her
Name was u&s;ed to &s;anctify the wicked
Actions of her Children, may their Wick|edne&s;s
be then made u&s;e of in order to
throw an <HI>Odium</HI> upon her. This is <HI>Argu|mentum
ad Hominem,</HI> and &s;hould influ|ence
tho&s;e among you who are for|ward
to think the wor&s;t of your Ad|ver&s;aries.
What Thoughts or Re&s;olu|tions
the Whigs may have with re|gard
to the Church, I know not:
But I am &s;ure they give her the deep|e&s;t
Wounds who di&s;honour her by
their. Friend&s;hip; who would be
thought zealous to promote her In|tere&s;t,
at the &s;ame Time that they
deny her Power in their Lives and
Practices.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="11">
That which, in the Eye of Rea&s;on,
gives any Church or Religion the Ad|vantage
above others, is the Influence it
hath upon the Lives of its Profe&s;&s;ors.
It is upon this foot that the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> ever e&s;pou&s;ing the Cau&s;e of
Virtue, Loyalty, and all Things lauda|ble,
in oppo&s;ition to Libertines, Rebels,
and Fanaticks, hath maintain'd her Cre|dit
and E&s;teem with wi&s;e Men. And if
we are really concern'd to &s;upport her
Honour, the right Way is to put her
Principles in practice, to be true to our
Oaths and Engagements, and live in every
re&s;pect as becometh peaceable and loyal
Subjects. The Diffenters have been a
long time &s;tigmatiz'd for Men of no
Loyalty, not acting upon Principle, but
govern'd by the narrow un&s;teady Views
of Pa&s;&s;ion and Intere&s;t. But will not the
Satyr be doubly keen upon our &s;elves,
if ever we are found guilty of tho&s;e
very Things that we &s;o heartily condemn
in others?</P>
<P>It is no ea&s;y matter to find out Eva|&s;ions
in &s;o plain a Ca&s;e; and yet it can
hardly be &s;uppos'd that a Man, who has
<PB N="14" REF="12">
any Sen&s;e of Religion, &s;hould commit
Perjury without &s;ome Salvo to his Con|&s;cience.
Perhaps you will &s;ay, that if it
be never lawful for a Subject to break
his Oath of Allegiance to his King, then
the Revolution cannot be ju&s;tified: Or, if
it may &s;ometimes be allow'd, why not
now as well as then? I an&s;wer, when
any Per&s;on, by Forfeiture or Abdication,
lo&s;eth Dominion, He is no longer Sove|reign:
Now the Subject &s;wore Allegiance
to the Sovereign, and not to the Per&s;on:
When therefore the Per&s;on cea&s;eth to be
Sovereign, the Allegiance cea&s;eth to be
due to him, and the Oath of cour&s;e
to bind. In the Judgment of mo&s;t Men
this was the Ca&s;e at the Revolution. But
nothing like this can be pretended now.
King <HI>George</HI> legally admini&s;ters that Go|vernment
to which he came with the
joint Con&s;ent and Acclamations of his
People; there being nothing done by
which he is le&s;s <HI>King</HI> now than he was
at the time you &s;wore to him: And con|&s;equently
there can be no Parallel be|tween
the Revolution and the pre&s;ent
Ca&s;e. I will not undertake to ju&s;tifie
every thing that is now done in point of
<PB N="15" REF="13">
Policy; but neither will impolitick Mea|&s;ures
ju&s;tify Subjects in taking the &s;ame
Steps they formerly did on the &s;core of
illegal Mea&s;ures. It is one thing to &s;ub|vert
a State, and another to turn out a
Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould have the Hardine&s;s to
object, that King <HI>George</HI> is in truth no
rightful King; and that therefore you are
not obliged to pay Obedience to him:
I ask, how you came then to acknow|ledge
him and &s;wear to him as rightful
<HI>King</HI>? You will &s;urely be a&s;hamed to
own, that in &s;o doing you acted again&s;t
your Opinion; or that &s;ince that time
your Eyes have been open'd, by the
Di&s;grace of Friends, or the Lo&s;s of an
Employment. But though we &s;hould
grant that he had originally no Right
to the Crown, yet when a Prince is once
in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and you have &s;worn
Allegiance to him, you are no longer at
liberty to enquire by what unrighteous
&s;teps he might have obtain'd it. But
there is nothing of that &s;o much as
&s;u&s;pected in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; it being
known to every body that <HI>King George</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="14">
came to the Crown without Force or Ar|tifice,
meerly in Compliance with the
Laws of the Land, and the unanimous
Reque&s;t of his People.</P>
<P>To determine the Rights of Princes
is a difficult Point, as requiring more
Skill in the Laws, more Knowledge of
particular Facts, more Lei&s;ure, and more
Under&s;tanding than mo&s;t Men are Ma&s;ters
of. But it is an ea&s;y matter to know
the Obligation and plain Sen&s;e of an
Oath. You know evidently that you
have &s;worn to King <HI>George,</HI> and abjured
the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and that you ought not to
for&s;wear your &s;elf. But, Do you as evi|dently
know that Hereditary is prefe|rable
to Parliamentary Right, and that
the Hereditary Right belongs to the <HI>Pre|tender</HI>?
If you do not, as I am &s;ure you
cannot, why will you violate the plain
manife&s;t Duties of Religion, under pre|tence
of ob&s;erving what is at be&s;t but
ob&s;cure and dubious? But though the
<HI>Pretender</HI>'s Right to the Crown were ne|ver
&s;o clear, it would not therefore be a
clear Point that you ought to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting
to him. On the contrary, it would be
<PB N="17" REF="15">
clear that you <HI>ought</HI> not, &s;ince you have
&s;worn that you <HI>would</HI> not.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t repeat to you, that what hath
been &s;aid was not done with a De&s;ign to
&s;pread or confirm the Reports of your
Adver&s;aries; but only to contribute, &s;o
far as in me lay, to remove or prevent
any ju&s;t Occa&s;ion of them. Lea&s;t of all
was it my Intention to in&s;inuate any thing
di&s;honourable of the Clergy, for who&s;e
Character I have a high Re&s;pect, and
whom I verily take to have been injured
by the Reports of warm Men. I &s;hall
&s;ay no more, but leave you to con&s;ider
