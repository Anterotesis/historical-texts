<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am in this ca&s;e Coun&s;el for Mr. <HI>John Magee,</HI> the alledged Proprietor of a News Paper, called, The <HI>Dublin Evening Po&s;t;</HI> and I could wi&s;h that the notice on his behalf, and on which I move, had not a double a&s;pect; I could wi&s;h that it had been confined to his claim of <HI>right,</HI> and not ex|tended to an application for <HI>favor.</HI></P>
<P>When we move, that a <HI>common appearance</HI> may be taken, without holding him to <HI>Special Bail,</HI> a great que&s;tion of con&s;titutional and public im|portance is involved in the &s;ubject; but when we apply to <HI>reduce</HI> the &s;um, the application appears like an appeal to the <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> of the Court. My duty to my client, obliges me to &s;ubmit my ob|&s;ervations in each point of view, though I &s;hould rather argue it in the ab&s;tract, for another rea&s;on, I might thereby avoid the &s;trange &s;tuff and mate|rial which the Plaintiff has introduced as <HI>merits</HI> into his affidavit, and I might thereby avoid (to u&s;e a dramatic quotation in a ca&s;e partly theatri|cal)
<PB N="10" REF="7">
that &s;tile of &s;peech <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"which though it may make the un&s;kilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the cen&s;ure of one of whom, out-weighs, in my mind, a whole theatre of others."</Q></P>
<P>My Lords, I am in this ca&s;e, with due defer|ence, to contend, that the learned Judge was not warranted by <HI>law</HI> in i&s;&s;uing his Fiat for <HI>any &s;um;</HI> for that in this ca&s;e <HI>common bail,</HI> which is no more than <HI>an appearance</HI> for the party, and properly &s;peaking no bail at all, is all that the <HI>law</HI> re|quires; but if your Lord&s;hips &s;hall be of opini|on that the learned Judge was authori&s;ed by law in i&s;&s;uing &s;uch Fiat, holding the Defendant to 4000<HI>l.</HI> bail, then I am to &s;ubmit to your Lord|&s;hips, that you are bound in con&s;cience to reduce the &s;um, becau&s;e you are bound, and it is the true &s;pirit of the law, to hold him to no greater bail, than in your con&s;cience you &s;hall think the <HI>Plaintiff can recover:</HI> and here my Lords it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to call your attention to the affidavit of the Plaintiff; it is <HI>his ca&s;e,</HI> and therefore I pre&s;ume, put in the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t manner that the na|ture of that ca&s;e would allow; it is the ground upon which a Judge's Fiat for 4000<HI>l.</HI> i&s;&s;ued; and there never was an affidavit containing the griev|ance of the party complaining, more <HI>weak,</HI> and more <HI>defective:</HI> THERE IS NOT THROUGHOUT

THIS AFFIDAVIT A SINGLE PER QUOD. The al|legded Libel is libellous only by <HI>forced</HI> con&s;truc|tion, by <HI>violent</HI> interpretation of an apparently <HI>unmeaning</HI> poem: the damages in amount are &s;o far from approaching to <HI>any</HI> degree of certainty, that it is rather obvious, that <HI>none</HI> were <HI>actually</HI> &s;u&s;tained: it <HI>hints</HI> at damages which <HI>may be,</HI> not which <HI>are</HI> &s;uffered; and &s;uch damages are <HI>ima|ginary:</HI> they are <HI>poetic;</HI> they are in the <HI>fancy;</HI> the <HI>conception</HI> of the party <HI>intere&s;ted;</HI> of him who &s;eeks redre&s;s in <HI>damages.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Richard Daly</HI> &s;tiles him&s;elf, in this, his affidavit, Manager of the Theatre Royal in the City of Dublin. He &s;tates that the Defendant, Mr. <HI>John Magee,</HI> is (as he believes) Printer and Publi&s;her of a certain News Paper, called The <HI>Dublin Evening Po&s;t,</HI> in which Paper he, <HI>John Magee,</HI> cau&s;ed to be publi&s;hed a defamatory Poem of the <HI>tenor</HI> in the Affidavit.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be &s;orry to feel my&s;elf under any ne|ce&s;&s;ity to recite this Poem to the Court; it is in truth a very &s;trange compo&s;ition, but may have its merit with tho&s;e who under&s;tand it; but as it is the cau&s;e of a Fiat, for 4000<HI>l.</HI> and as it con|tains, or rather is it&s;elf, the offence for which my client is in dure&s;s, until he &s;hall procure bail to that amount; I have &s;elected and &s;hall faithfully

<P>Ro&s;cius laments:<Q><L>"<HI>That humble Actre&s;&s;es will no longer obedient bend:</HI>"</L></Q></P>
<P>That,<Q><L>"<HI>Franci&s;co now delights the admiring throng.</HI>"</L></Q></P>

<P>Then Cupid arrives, to whom Ro&s;cius &s;ays,<Q><L>"<HI>Does &s;ome lady court me to her arms,</HI></L>

<P>The&s;e are the <HI>criminal</HI> extracts from the alledg|ed Libel, a poem full of non&s;en&s;e, ribaldry, and bomba&s;t, not to be matched in a Mock Tragedy, truly farcical, were it not that the &s;um of 4000<HI>l.</HI> has changed the performance to a Tragi-Comedy.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="11">
For the publication of this poem the defendant has been arre&s;ted under a writ i&s;&s;ued by authority of a Fiat, and marked for 4000<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>My Lords, there have been of late, and I la|ment it, many bold, impudent, plain, and inde|fen&s;ible Libels; why are the weake&s;t &s;elected to di&s;grace the records of the Court, and to bring contempt upon the Ju&s;tice of the country.&mdash;And now, my Lords, let me call your attention to what ought to be the <HI>material</HI> part of an affidavit, to warrant a Fiat in any ca&s;e; to that part which relates to <HI>the damage &s;u&s;tained.</HI> In this ca&s;e the <HI>&s;ingle in&s;tance</HI> in which the Plaintiff <HI>endeavours</HI> to &s;hew any &s;pecial damage, HE FAILS IN THE AT|TEMPT, and the fair inference, from his own words, is, that he has &s;uffered <HI>little, if any.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;wearing that he had expended con&s;ider|able &s;ums, in the embelli&s;hment of the Theatre Royal, and that he has hitherto &s;upported a good repute and credit; he proceeds, and &s;tates in his affidavit <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that by the fal&s;e and &s;candalous publications concerning him, he has already experienced their injurious tenden|cy, <HI>as</HI> a very eminent performer, whom he had retained in Great Britain to act at his Theatre in this City, did, from the fal&s;e and &s;candalous publications again&s;t him, expre&s;s <HI>a doubt</HI> of
<PB N="15" REF="12">
his credit and punctuality, and that therefore <HI>a large</HI> and <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> &s;um mu&s;t be paid in ad|vance; and <HI>if it had not been</HI> for the interfer|ence of &s;ome friends, <HI>he would have been de|prived</HI> of the advantage of &s;uch performer."</Q></P>
<P>Now, what is the inference here?&mdash;he ad|vanced nothing, and the actre&s;s came and ful|filled her engagement:&mdash;take it, that he did ad|vance&mdash;<HI>how much</HI>&mdash;and where is the magnitude of the injury, in advancing to a performer a &s;um, <HI>on account,</HI> if the manager ever intended to pay? and this is the <HI>only</HI> &s;tatement of an injury <HI>actually</HI> &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of indefinite words in an affidavit, may be &s;ometimes very convenient, but when injury is to be redre&s;&s;ed in damages, and the party held to bail, the &s;ecurity &s;hould be proportioned to the probable redre&s;s; and the law requires &s;ome mea&s;ure, whereby &s;uch &s;ecurity may be <HI>limited</HI> and not <HI>extended.</HI></P>
<P>The Plaintiff in this ca&s;e feeling, perhaps, that a Fiat for 4000<HI>l.</HI> on the ground he has &s;tated, and which I have followed, would be as ridicu|lous as it is outrageous, adds, that he has chil|dren, among whom are &s;our growing-up daugh|ters,
<PB N="16" REF="13">
who, in their <HI>future</HI> pro&s;pects in life, <HI>may</HI> receive con&s;iderable injury; and he then &s;wears, that he has <HI>good rea&s;on</HI> to be <HI>convinced</HI> he <HI>has</HI> &s;uf|fered damages to the amount of FOUR THOU|SAND POUNDS and upwards&mdash;how?&mdash;by an <HI>advance</HI> to a performer, and the injuries his family or him&s;elf <HI>may hereafter</HI> &s;uffer. See, my Lords, the danger that might ari&s;e from any man carving the mea&s;ure of his own redre&s;s, in e&s;timating the value of the injury he has &s;u&s;tained; that which is but <HI>ideal</HI> will become <HI>real,</HI> and he will tell you he has <HI>good rea&s;on</HI> to be <HI>convinced:</HI> and I be&s;eech your Lord&s;hips attention to this, becau&s;e it illu&s;trates the doctrine of the law (which I &s;hall &s;ubmit to you) with re&s;pect to <HI>bail</HI> in actions of <HI>defamation.</HI></P>
<P>The Plaintiff concludes his affidavit in &s;tating, that John Magee (the Defendant) gives out that he is a man of <HI>very con&s;iderable property,</HI> as well in money as in &s;everal News Papers. Why this is introduced I cannot di&s;cover, it is introduced <HI>as true,</HI> and if true, it is a rea&s;on for a common appearance, becau&s;e the Plaintiff him&s;elf alledges a &s;ufficient re&s;pon&s;ibility in the Defendant whom he &s;ues.</P>
<P>The Defendant, John Magee, has made an affidavit in aid of the pre&s;ent application, in which
<PB N="17" REF="14">
he &s;wears, that a writ i&s;&s;ued in or as of la&s;t Trinity Term, to the Sheriffs of the City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> marked for the &s;um of 4000<HI>l.</HI> under authority of a Fiat granted by the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, and founded on an affidavit of Richard Daly the Plaintiff; that upon &s;uch writ he was arre&s;ted in <HI>June</HI> la&s;t; that in con&s;equence of a number of vexatious &s;uits and pro&s;ecutions again&s;t him, and in con&s;e|quence of the proceedings in this cau&s;e, and from the reiterated abu&s;e he has received in the Free|man's Journal, he is extremely injured in his credit, in&s;omuch, that though he has u&s;ed every effort in his power, <HI>he cannot now procure bail in this cau&s;e for the amount of the &s;um marked at the foot of &s;aid writ,</HI> or to any larger amount than 500<HI>l.</HI> and &s;aith, he verily believes, that the Plaintiff hath not &s;uffered damage in this cau&s;e to any amount what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hips have now before you the facts or merits of the ca&s;e, but I tru&s;t your Lord&s;hips will decide on a great que&s;tion of public and of con|&s;titutional importance, without any reference to the particular circum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; I reject them as unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;ave only to the &s;e|cond part of the application, the <HI>reducement</HI> of the bail, which will al&s;o become unnece&s;&s;ary, if your Lord&s;hips &s;hall be of opinion, that the De|fendant
<PB N="18" REF="15">
is not bound by law to give <HI>any &s;ecurity whatever.</HI></P>
<P>Then, my Lords, I with confidence a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>a common appearance</HI> is all the law requires in actions of <HI>defamation,</HI> and to compel <HI>any &s;ecu|rity</HI> to <HI>any amount</HI> is an <HI>extortion</HI> on the &s;ubject, and <HI>illegal.</HI></P>
<P>It is plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve in what great e&s;teem the law holds <HI>per&s;onal freedom,</HI> ju&s;tly con&s;idering the general liberty of the &s;ubject, as dependant on that of the individual; and &s;o tender has the law been of this liberty, that no man could be deprived of his per&s;onal freedom, unle&s;s for &s;ome <HI>criminal, fla|grant</HI> offence, injurious to the government under which he lived, or for &s;ome <HI>tortius</HI> act, commit|ted with <HI>force,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>in breach of the peace,</HI> which his allegiance and duty required him to keep and pre&s;erve. It is thus well ex|pre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Crompton</HI>'s admirable introduction to a late very excellent compilation.</P>
<P>I grant that the legal requi&s;ition of bail, pro|perly called Special Bail, is, and has been, for many years le&s;s confined; but then, it has been extended from <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and upon <HI>principle;</HI> as in DEBT,&mdash;what is the rule of law&mdash;if the debt <HI>ab&s;o|lutely</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="16">
amounts to a &s;um <HI>certain,</HI> then the debtor may be held to <HI>&s;pecial bail;</HI> but where the de|mand is not <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> but <HI>uncertain,</HI> and &s;ounds in damages&mdash;NOT SO:&mdash;And the principle, is;&mdash;the Plaintiff &s;hall not be the <HI>judge</HI> of the injury he cannot <HI>a&s;certain,</HI> becau&s;e it would make the Defendant the victim of the Plaintiff's <HI>conception.</HI></P>
<P>A Judge indeed may in &s;everal ca&s;es grant a Fiat, to hold a party to &s;pecial bail, but in every ca&s;e, it can only be where the demand is <HI>certain</HI> as IN DEBT, or where the injury is <HI>&s;o outrageous,</HI> that damages mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> have been &s;uffered; there the Judge has &s;ome <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> &s;ome <HI>guide;</HI> but even there he is bound to be <HI>moderate;</HI> for in the language of the Bill of Rights <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"exce&s;&s;ive bail ought not to be required."</Q></P>
<P>And here, my Lords, I think I take the doc|trine in its utmo&s;t latitude: In ca&s;es of DEFAMA|TION or SLANDER (&s;ave only <HI>two</HI> exceptions which I &s;hall mention,) a Judge is not warranted to grant a Fiat, for the Defendant &s;hall be held only to <HI>common bail.</HI> As to SPECIAL BAIL, ca&s;es of defamation are excepted in every authority, from the olde&s;t down to <HI>Crompton's</HI> late Dige&s;t on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="17">
The fir&s;t mention of Special Bail in &s;lander was in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and that only in the ca&s;e of <HI>&s;landering the title of lands;</HI> previous to that time, &s;pecial bail was required in no ca&s;e of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> &s;lander: Afterwards &s;pecial bail was ex|tended to <HI>Scandalum Magnatum,</HI> and no further; &s;o that the two exceptions evidently &s;upport the doctrine.</P>
<P>In <HI>Crompton</HI> 29, title BAIL, "in tre&s;pa&s;s, a&s;|&s;ault, battery, con&s;piracy, fal&s;e impri&s;onment, there &s;hall be <HI>common bail</HI> only, <HI>unle&s;s on a motion or order made by the Court or a Judge:</HI> your Lord|&s;hips will ob&s;erve, that this &s;aving of motion, or order, applies only to <HI>&s;uch</HI> actions, in which, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, common bail is all the law re|quires; and you will ob&s;erve what follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"IN SLANDER common bail <HI>only,</HI> unle&s;s in &s;lander of <HI>title,</HI> and <HI>then</HI> common or &s;pecial in the di&s;|cretion of the Court."</Q> This is laid down as the law in <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1654: and the authority adds, as the practice <HI>after</HI> that period, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>or unle&s;s &s;poken of a per&s;on of quality.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This complimentary conce&s;&s;ion was introduced, perhaps, con&s;idering peers as the hereditary legi&s;la|tors of the realm, the king's hereditary coun&s;ellors, and forming the Court of ultimate appeal and final juri&s;diction; the welfare of the empire depend|ing,

<P>Lord Chief Baron <HI>Comyn</HI> in his Dige&s;t Vol. I.

<P>I call upon gentlemen to &s;hew any di&s;tinction taken in any authority, between &s;lander <HI>written</HI> and SLANDER <HI>&s;poken, with re&s;pect to the doctrine of bail,</HI> I know there are di&s;tinctions between <HI>libel</HI> and &s;lander <HI>&s;poken;</HI> I know one has ju&s;tly a greater degree of criminality annexed to it, than the other: but with regard to <HI>bail,</HI> I &s;ay, DEFA|MATION is the general head, including every &s;pecies of &s;lander, written, painted, engraved, &s;poken, <HI>ou outrement,</HI> or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>My Lords, &s;o tenacious is the law of per&s;onal liberty, and &s;o tender have Judges been with re|gard to it, that even in ca&s;es where the law re|cogni&s;ed, and allowed &s;pecial bail, where even the ground of the application &s;eemed fair and rea&s;onable, Courts have refu&s;ed to hold the &s;ub|ject to &s;pecial bail, becau&s;e the ca&s;e <HI>might not</HI> ulti|mately warrant it.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="20">
In 2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 1157, <HI>Heathcot</HI> again&s;t <HI>Go&s;lin.</HI>&mdash;The affidavit to hold to bail was, that the Defen|dant borrowed 2000<HI>l.</HI> of the Plaintiff on bottom|ree, <HI>which money is now due and owing</HI> to this De|ponent, by virtue of the &s;aid bond, <HI>as thereby may appear</HI>&mdash;Objected, that this was no oath of the debt; for &s;uppo&s;e every penny is paid, and a &s;eparate receipt taken, yet upon the face of the bond the whole will appear due, <HI>et per curiam;</HI> it is not &s;ufficient; the Plaintiff would have made a <HI>&s;upplemental</HI> affidavit, but the court refu&s;ed to receive it; for the act of parliament requires a full oath, previous to the i&s;&s;uing the proce&s;s, that Defendants may not be <HI>hara&s;ed;</HI> and therefore in this ca&s;e the Defendant was di&s;charged upon <HI>com|mon</HI> bail.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, Mr. <HI>Daly</HI> has made a <HI>&s;ub&s;e|quent</HI> affidavit; but &s;uch affidavit could be no ground for the arre&s;t, for it was not <HI>in e&s;&s;e,</HI> when the Fiat was granted.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 975, <HI>Gammage</HI> again&s;t <HI>Watkin</HI>&mdash;The original debt was <HI>under</HI> the &s;um entitled to &s;peci|al bail; but the co&s;ts &s;welled it <HI>over;</HI> and the Plaintiff had judgment, on which he brought debt, and held the Defendant to bail; and now upon motion the court ordered <HI>common bail</HI> to be accepted; for as the original demand did not re|quire
<PB N="24" REF="21">
bail, the addition of co&s;ts will not alter the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And yet, my Lords, here, the co&s;ts and the original demand were liquidated, and in law became <HI>one debt;</HI> but the Court in its deci&s;ion, guided by attention and attachment to per&s;onal li|berty, made the di&s;tinction in its favour; and the like attention and attachment appear to govern in every ca&s;e.</P>
<P>4 <HI>Burrow,</HI> 655, <HI>Pomp.</HI> ver&s;. <HI>Ludrig&s;on.</HI>&mdash;A rule for di&s;charging the Defendant upon <HI>common</HI> bail was made ab&s;olute; the affidavit to hold him to <HI>&s;pecial</HI> bail, <HI>not</HI> being <HI>po&s;&s;itive;</HI> which, it is the e&s;tabli&s;hed rule of the court, <Q REND="inline">"that it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be."</Q> This was the ca&s;e of a merchant in <HI>London,</HI> who&s;e corre&s;pondent in <HI>Sweden</HI> had &s;ent him over the accounts from <HI>Sweden, where the debt aro&s;e:</HI> and con&s;equently the Plaintiff, the merchant in <HI>London,</HI> could only &s;wear to his <HI>belief,</HI> with a <HI>re|ference</HI> to the accounts &s;ent to him from <HI>Sweden;</HI> the fact it&s;elf not being within his own per&s;onal knowledge: &s;o that the affidavit could not have been more po&s;itive than it was, unle&s;s the corre&s;|pondent in <HI>Sweden</HI> could have come over to <HI>Lon|don</HI> to &s;wear it.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="22">
2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 1209, <HI>Rios</HI> ver&s;. <HI>Relifante.</HI>&mdash;The affi|davit to hold to <HI>&s;pecial</HI> bail was made by a mer|chant in <HI>London,</HI> &s;wearing that the Defendant owed the Plaintiff 270<HI>l.</HI> as appears by an affidavit made by the Plaintiff in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> which he, the Deponent, <HI>believes</HI> to be true, <HI>et per curi|am;</HI> there can only be <HI>common</HI> bail; the oath abroad is no ground, and there is nothing but <HI>belief,</HI> which is not &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hips will ob&s;erve, that the&s;e are <HI>commercial</HI> ca&s;es, and from the nature of com|merce, and the &s;ituation of parties connected with it, &s;imilar ca&s;es may every day occur; yet we find no attempt at an argument founded on <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ity</HI> or <HI>public benefit</HI> to extend the power of the Court.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 1226, <HI>Clapham&s;on</HI> ver&s;. <HI>Bowman.</HI> The Plaintiff's BOOK-KEEPER, &s;wore, that the De|fendant was indebted to the Plaintiff in 3400<HI>l.</HI> for money had and received by the Defendant, to the u&s;e of the Plaintiff, <HI>as this Deponent verily believes;</HI> and the Court held it not &s;ufficient to hold the Defendant to <HI>&s;pecial</HI> bail.</P>
<P>This was the ca&s;e of a <HI>book-keeper,</HI> &s;wearing as fully as he con&s;cientiou&s;ly could; no merchant keeps his own books, becau&s;e he cannot be a wit|ne&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="23">
to prove any debt due to him&s;elf; his clerk who mu&s;t be his witne&s;s, who &s;hould be privy to the dealing, and who keeps the account, can &s;carcely extend his oath, were he ever &s;o correct beyond the be&s;t of his belief; yet, in &s;uch ca&s;e, if the charge be not POSITIVE <HI>common</HI> bail only is allowed.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Strange,</HI> 1219, <HI>Walrond</HI> ver&s;. <HI>Fran&s;ham,</HI> an executrix in order to hold the Defendant to bail, made an affidavit, that he was indebted to her te&s;tator (&s;o much) <HI>as appears by the books of the te&s;tator;</HI> and it was held in&s;ufficient and <HI>common</HI> bail ordered.</P>
<P>Here could have been no <HI>po&s;itive</HI> affidavit; the creditor was dead; the Plaintiff was an exe|cutrix, and &s;ued in &s;uch right; the office is highly favoured in law; the a&s;&s;ets (of which credits may make a principal part) are com|mitted for the be&s;t purpo&s;es; and among the fir&s;t, the payment of the te&s;tator's debts: yet in this ca&s;e, the ca&s;e, I &s;ay, of an <HI>executrix,</HI> &s;uing in the right of another, in whom no private or per&s;onal intere&s;t could be pre&s;umed, and laying before the Court the be&s;t foun|dation in her power&mdash;<HI>common</HI> bail only.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="24">
Compare, my Lords, &s;uch ca&s;es with the pre&s;ent, and can you doubt; compare &s;uch af|fidavits with that of Mr. Daly, who&s;e <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> lo&s;&s;es are the conjecture, &s;urmi&s;e, apprehen&s;ion and belief of <HI>future</HI> injuries.</P>
<P>The ca&s;es I have quoted are ca&s;es within the de&s;cription, and reach of <HI>&s;pecial</HI> bail; the ca&s;e of Daly is that of <HI>defamation,</HI> entitled only, as I apprehend, to <HI>common</HI> bail; certain|ly to no more, where no <HI>actual</HI> damage is &s;worn to have been &s;uffered, certainly, not to the extent, which confines him <HI>before</HI> trial to an amount, which might be con&s;idered as exce&s;|&s;ive in damages <HI>after</HI> verdict.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, laying a&s;ide the parties, and the particular circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, what is the great and important que&s;tion?&mdash;if the exten|&s;ive and extending con&s;cience of a &s;uitor, par|tial to him&s;elf, in fancied injuries and imagi|nary ills, can impo&s;e on the credulity of a Judge; if the Judge may, at his <HI>di&s;cretion,</HI> hold a &s;ub|ject in pri&s;on <HI>previous to trial,</HI> on terms with which he cannot comply; the <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> of the Judge may become the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of the Man; where then will be the difference between FIAT and LETTER DE CACHET: if &s;uch be the practice, <HI>we are not &s;afe;</HI> we have obtained
<PB N="28" REF="25">
nothing by the glorious Revolution; we have no &s;ecurity in the great Charter, in the Bill of Rights, in the Habeas Corpus: the atchieve|ments of liberty may decorate the monument of a former con&s;titution, or be like &s;tandards taken from an enemy, hung up, old, torn and u&s;ele&s;s, &s;ave only to &s;hew a degraded po&s;terity, the virtue and valour of their ance&s;tors.&mdash;No, my Lords, I tru&s;t, that a great and able Judge, will this day add a brighter glory to his name, his rank, and office, than any in the power of Maje&s;ty to confer, by nobly &s;aying, what the be&s;t have &s;aid, and what none but the be&s;t will &s;ay, <HI>I have been wrong:</HI>&mdash;a generous and a grateful people will applaud, ble&s;s, record the expre&s;&s;ion, and honour even the error that cau&s;ed it.</P>
