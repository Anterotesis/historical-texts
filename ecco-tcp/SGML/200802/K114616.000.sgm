<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. THE DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>SUPERFICIAL, though zealous, Ob&s;ervers, think they &s;ee the Source of all our public Mi&s;carriages in the parti|cular and accidental Mi&s;conduct of Indivi|duals. This is not much to be wondered at, becau&s;e it is &s;o ea&s;y a Solution.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="9">
THIS pretence, too, is plau&s;ibly urged upon the People by profligate Scribblers, who find their Account in it. It is a &s;ort of Compliment paid the Public, to per&s;uade them, that they have no Share in the Pro|duction of the&s;e national Misfortunes.</P>
<P>BUT a candid and mature Con&s;ideration will convince us, that the Malady lies deeper than what is commonly &s;u&s;pected: and, on impartial Enquiry, it will pro|bably be found &s;pringing, not from vary|ing and incidental, but from permanent and e&s;tabli&s;hed Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>IT is the ob&s;ervation of the greate&s;t of political Writers, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is by no means Fortune that rules the World: for this we may appeal to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who had a long Series of Pro&s;perities, when they acted upon a certain Plan; and an
<PB N="13" REF="10">
uninterrupted Cour&s;e of Misfortunes, when they conducted them&s;elves upon another. There are general Cau&s;es, na|tural or moral, which operate in every State; which rai&s;e, &s;upport, or overturn it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="margQuotes">"Ce n'e&s;t pas la Fortune qui domine le Monde: on peut le demander aux Romains, qui eurent une &s;uite continuelle des Pro&s;perit&eacute;s quand ils &s;e gou|vernerent &s;ur un certain Plan, &amp; une &s;uite non in|terrompue de revers lors qu'ils &s;e condui&s;irent &s;ur un autre. Il y a des Cau&s;es generales, &s;oit morales, &s;oit phy&s;iques, qui agi&s;&s;ent dans chaque Monarchie, l'elevent, la maintiennent, ou la precipitent."</Q> <BIBL><HI>Grandeur,</HI> &amp;c, <HI>des Romains,</HI> c. 18.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>AMONG all the&s;e various Cau&s;es, none perhaps &s;o much contributes to rai&s;e or &s;ink a Nation, as the Manners and Principles of its People. But as there never was any declining Nation, which had not Cau&s;es of Declen&s;ion peculiar to it&s;elf, &s;o it will re|quire a minute Inve&s;tigation into the lead|ing
<PB N="14" REF="11">
Manners and Principles of the pre&s;ent Times, to throw a ju&s;t Light on the pecu|liar Cau&s;es of our calamitous Situation.</P>
<P>To delineate the&s;e Manners and Princi|ples without Aggravation or Weakne&s;s, to unravel their Effects on the public State and Welfare, and to trace them to their real though di&s;tant Sources, is indeed a Ta&s;k of equal Difficulty and Importance.</P>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary therefore to apolo|gi&s;e even for the Attempt: as being &s;up|po&s;ed to lie beyond the Sphere of him who makes it. To this it can only be replied, that a common Eye may <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> di&s;cover a lurking Rock or Sand, while the able and experienced Mariners overlook the Danger, through their Attention to the Helm, the Sails, or Rigging.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="12">
HE will be much mi&s;taken, who expects to find here a Vein of undi&s;tingui&s;hing and licentious Satire. To rail at the Times at large, can &s;erve no good Purpo&s;e; and ge|nerally ari&s;eth from a Want of Knowledge or a Want of Hone&s;ty. There never was an Age or Nation that had not Virtues and Vices peculiar to it&s;elf: And in &s;ome Re|&s;pects, perhaps, there is no Time nor Country delivered down to us in Story, in which a wi&s;e Man would &s;o much wi&s;h to have lived, as in our own.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this, our Situation &s;eems mo&s;t dangerous: We are rolling to the Brink of a Precipice that mu&s;t de&s;troy us.</P>
<P>AT &s;uch a Juncture, to hold up a true Mirroir to the Public, and let the Nation &s;ee <HI>them&s;elves</HI> as the Authors of their own
<PB N="16" REF="13">
Misfortunes, cannot be a very popular De|&s;ign. But as the Writer is not &s;ollicitous about private Con&s;equences, he can with the greater Security adopt the Words of an hone&s;t and &s;en&s;ible Man.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">"MOST commonly, &s;uch as palliate Evils, and repre&s;ent the State of Things in a &s;ounder Condition than truly they are, do thereby con&s;ult be&s;t for them|&s;elves, and better recommend their own Bu&s;ine&s;s and Preten&s;ions in the World: But he who, to the utmo&s;t of his Skill and Power, &s;peaks the Truth, where the Good of his King and Country are concerned, will be mo&s;t e&s;teemed by Per&s;ons of Virtue and Wi&s;dom: And to the Favour and Protection of &s;uch, the&s;e Papers are committed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Davenant,</HI> on Trade.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of the Spirit of Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enumerate the concurrent Cau&s;es of our pre&s;ent Misfortunes and De|cline; let us, by way of Contra&s;t, mu&s;ter the few remaining Virtues we have left; to which, in part, it is owing, that our Misfortunes are not heavier, and our De|cline more rapid.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t im|portant, is the Spirit of Liberty. This, happily, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among us: Not in|deed in its genuine Vigour; for then, it would work its genuine effects. Yet, that the Love of Liberty is not extingui&s;hed, appears from the <HI>united Voice</HI> of a <HI>divided People.</HI> It &s;till animates their Conver&s;a|tion, and invigorates their Addre&s;&s;es: tho'
<PB N="18" REF="15">
in their Conduct it appears no more. But it is remarkable, that in Proportion as this Spirit hath grown weak in <HI>Deeds,</HI> it hath gained Strength in <HI>Words;</HI> and of late run out, into unbounded Licen&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS, however, appears beyond a Doubt: that we all wi&s;h to continue free; tho' we have not the Virtue to &s;ecure our Freedom. The Spirit of Liberty is now &s;truggling with the <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Principles,</HI> as formerly it &s;truggled with the <HI>Tyrants</HI> of the Time. But the Danger is now greater, becau&s;e the Enemy is <HI>within;</HI> working &s;ecretly and &s;ecurely, and de&s;troy|ing all tho&s;e <HI>internal Powers,</HI> from which alone an effectual Oppo&s;ition can ari&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEREVER this Spirit of Liberty &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts in its full Vigour, the Vigilance and Power of impotent Governors are vain: A Nation can neither be &s;urpri&s;ed nor com|pelled
<PB N="19" REF="16">
into Slavery: When this is extin|gui&s;hed, neither the Virtue nor Vigilance of Patriots can &s;ave it. In the Reign of JAMES the Second, <HI>Great Britain</HI> was free, tho' a de&s;potic Prince was on the Throne: At the Time when CESAR fell, <HI>Rome</HI> was &s;till in&s;laved, tho' the Tyrant was no more.</P>
<P>THIS great Spirit hath produced more full and complete Effects in our own Country, than in any known Nation that ever was upon Earth. It appears indeed, from a Concurrence of Facts too large to be produced here, that whereas it hath been ingrafted by the Arts of Policy in other Countries, it &s;hoots up here as from its natu|ral Climate, Stock, and Soil. From this Di&s;tinction, if laid in Nature, two or three Con&s;equences will fairly ari&s;e. Its Ef|fects mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be more vigorous
<PB N="20" REF="17">
and full. It's De&s;truction, by external Violence, will probably be no more than temporary. It's chief Danger mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;uch Cau&s;es, as may poi&s;on the Root; or attack, and de&s;troy the natural Spirit it&s;elf: The&s;e mu&s;t be &s;uch Cau&s;es, as can &s;teal upon, and &s;ubdue the <HI>Mind:</HI> that is, they mu&s;t be <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ome Degene|racy or Corruption of the Manners and Principles of the People."</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the Spirit of Humanity.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now trace the Spirit of Liberty through &s;uch of its Effects, as are not yet de|&s;troyed by oppo&s;ite Principles and Manners.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t that occurs, is <HI>Humanity.</HI> By this, is not meant that Smoothne&s;s and re|fined Poli&s;h of external Manners, by which the pre&s;ent Age affects to be di&s;tingui&s;hed:
<PB N="21" REF="18">
for this, it is apprehended, will belong to another Cla&s;s. By <HI>Humanity,</HI> therefore, is meant, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Pity for Di&s;tre&s;s, that Mo|deration in limiting Puni&s;hments by their proper Ends and Mea&s;ures, by which this Nation hath always been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P>THE Lenity of our Laws in capital Ca|&s;es; our Compa&s;&s;ion for convicted Crimi|nals; even the general Humanity of our Highwaymen and Robbers, compared with tho&s;e of other Countries; the&s;e are concur|rent Proofs, that the Spirit of Humanity is natural to our Nation.</P>
<P>THE many noble Foundations for the Relief of the Mi&s;erable and the Friendle&s;s; the large annual Supplies from voluntary Charities to the&s;e Foundations; the frequent and generous A&s;&s;i&s;tance given to the Unfor|tunate, who cannot be admitted into the&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="19">
Foundations; all the&s;e are &s;uch indi&s;puta|ble Proofs of a national Humanity, as it were the highe&s;t Inju&s;tice not to acknow|ledge and applaud.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the civil Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER Virtue, and of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, as it regards the immediate and private Happine&s;s of Individuals, yet left among us, is the pure Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, as it regards private Property.</P>
<P>MANY Cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;igned, for the Continuance of this public Ble&s;&s;ing. The Spirit of Liberty and Humanity beget a Spirit of Equity, where no contrary Pa&s;&s;ion interferes: The Spirit of Commerce, now predominant, begets a kind of regulated Selfi&s;hne&s;s, which tends at once to the In|crea&s;e and Pre&s;ervation of Property. The Difficulty of corrupting Juries under the
<PB N="23" REF="20">
Checks of their pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, in mo&s;t Ca&s;es prevents the very Attempt. And the long-continued Example of a great Per&s;on on the Seat of Equity, hath diffu&s;ed an uncorrupt Spirit through the inferior Courts, and will &s;hine to the late&s;t Po&s;terity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V. Of the Ruling Manners of the Times.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING made this prefatory E&s;timate of tho&s;e remaining Manners which may demand E&s;teem and Applau&s;e, let us now proceed to the ruling Manners of the Times; from which this Age and Nation derives its pre&s;ent and particular Complex|ion.</P>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that this de&s;igned E&s;timate extends not to the com|parative Excellence of Manners and Prin|ciples,
<PB N="24" REF="21">
con&s;idered in every View, and in all their Variety of near and remote Effects. It relates not to the immediate Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery, which Individuals, Families, or Nations, may derive from the Force of prevailing Principles and Manners. The&s;e Effects branch out into an Infinity of in|tricate Combinations, which cannot be comprehended in the pre&s;ent, but will make a material Part of &s;ome future En|quiry. This E&s;timate, therefore, confines it&s;elf to &s;uch Con&s;equences only, as affect the <HI>Duration</HI> of the <HI>public State:</HI> So that the leading Que&s;tion will be, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How far the pre&s;ent ruling Manners and Principles of this Nation may tend to its Continu|ance or De&s;truction."</Q></P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of this Re&s;triction, the Manners and Principles of the common People will &s;carce find a Place in the Ac|count. For though the Sum total of a Na|tions
<PB N="25" REF="22">
immediate Happine&s;s mu&s;t ari&s;e, and be e&s;timated, from the Manners and Prin|ciples of the Whole; yet the Manners and Principles of tho&s;e who <HI>lead,</HI> not of tho&s;e who <HI>are led;</HI> of tho&s;e who <HI>govern,</HI> not of tho&s;e who <HI>are governed;</HI> of tho&s;e, in &s;hort, who <HI>make</HI> Laws or <HI>execute</HI> them, will ever determine the Strength or Weakne&s;s, and therefore the Continuance or Di&s;&s;olution, of a State.</P>
<P>FOR the blind Force or Weight of an ungoverned Multitude can have no &s;teady nor rational Effect, unle&s;s &s;ome <HI>leading Mind</HI> rou&s;e it into Action, and <HI>point</HI> it to it's proper <HI>End:</HI> without this, it is either a <HI>brute</HI> and random <HI>Bolt,</HI> or a <HI>lifele&s;s Ball</HI> &s;leeping in the <HI>Cannon:</HI> It depends on &s;ome &s;uperior <HI>Intelligence,</HI> to give it both <HI>Impul&s;e</HI> and <HI>Direction.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, were the <HI>People</HI> remarkably corrupt, they might properly make a Part
<PB N="26" REF="23">
of this Enquiry: But in mo&s;t of tho&s;e im|portant Circum&s;tances to which this E&s;ti|mate refers, they are in general much more irreproachable than their Superiors in Sta|tion; e&s;pecially, if we except the lower Ranks of tho&s;e who live in great Towns. It will therefore be unnece&s;&s;ary to mark the Character of their Principles or Man|ners, unle&s;s where they appear evidently poi&s;oned by the Example or other Influence of the higher Ranks in Life.</P>
<P>Now the &s;lighe&s;t Ob&s;ervation, if at|tended with Impartiality, may convince us, that the Character of the Manners of this Age and Nation, is by no means that of <HI>abandoned Wickedne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Profligacy.</HI> This Degree of Degeneracy, indeed, is often imputed to the Times: But, to what Times hath it <HI>not</HI> been imputed? Pre&s;ent Objects are naturally magnified to the hu|man
<PB N="27" REF="24">
Eye, while remote ones, though lar|ger in Dimen&s;ions, vani&s;h into nothing. Hence the Speculative and Virtuous, in every Age, confining their Views to their own Period, have been apt to aggravate its Manners into the highe&s;t Degree of Guilt; to <HI>&s;atyrize,</HI> rather than <HI>de&s;cribe;</HI> to throw their re&s;pective Times into one dark Shade of <HI>Horror,</HI> rather than mark their peculiar <HI>Colour</HI> and <HI>Complexion.</HI></P>
<P>HERE, a large Field of Compari&s;on and Debate would open, were it nece&s;&s;ary or even expedient to enter upon it. We might ca&s;t our Eye upon the Manners of ROME, CARTHAGE, and many other States, in their la&s;t declining Period; where we &s;hould behold &s;uch tragic Scenes of Cruelty, Impiety, and Oppre&s;&s;ion, as would confound the mo&s;t &s;anguine Advocate for the Manners of Antiquity. But, in Truth,
<PB N="28" REF="25">
there can be no Occa&s;ion for this Di&s;play of <HI>Profligacy:</HI> For if the previous E&s;timate, already given, be ju&s;t; if the Spirit of <HI>Li|berty, Humanity,</HI> and <HI>Equity,</HI> be in a <HI>cer|tain Degree</HI> yet left among us, &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Foundations of abandoned Wickedne&s;s and Profligacy can have no Place: For the&s;e are <HI>Servility, Cruelty,</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion.</HI> How far we may be from this la&s;t Period of Degeneracy, it were Pre&s;umption to affirm: At pre&s;ent, it is certain, we are not arrived at it. When|ever this fatal Time approaches, it will come di&s;tingui&s;hed by its proper and pecu|liar Characters; and whoever &s;hall e&s;timate &s;uch Times, will find him&s;elf under the &s;ame Circum&s;tance with the great Hi&s;to|rian, who, in the profligate Period of de|clining ROME, tells us he had nothing to relate, but <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"fal&s;e Accu&s;ations, bloody Pro&s;criptions, treacherous Friend&s;hips,
<PB N="29" REF="26">
and the De&s;truction of the Inno|cent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="margQuotes">"Saeva ju&s;&s;a, continuas accu&s;ationes, fallaces amicitias, perniciem innocentium."</Q> <HI>Tacit. An|nal.</HI> l. iv.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THIS, we may truly affirm, is far from the Character of the Manners of our Times: which, on a fair Examination, will pro|bably appear to be that of a <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>"vain, luxu|rious,</HI> and <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> EFFEMINACY."</Q></P>
<P>THIS will be evident from a &s;imple Enu|meration of acknowledged Facts: many of them indeed, in Appearance, too trite to merit Notice, and too trifling for Rebuke; were they not, in their Tendency, as fa|tal to the Stability of a Nation, as Maxims and Manners more apparently flagitious.</P>
<P>As the fir&s;t Habits of Infancy and Youth commonly determine the Character of the
<PB N="30" REF="27">
Man, we might trace the Effeminacy of modern Manners, even to the unwhole|&s;ome Warmth of a Nur&s;ery. As &s;oon as the puny Infant is &s;uffered to peep from this Fountain of <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> and Di&s;ea&s;e, he is confirmed in the Habits already contract|ed, by a mi&s;taken Tenderne&s;s and Care. The <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"School Boy's Satchel, and &s;hining Morning-Face,"</Q> once the Characteri&s;tic of the Age it&s;elf, are now only to be &s;een among the Sons of Villagers and Pea&s;ants; while the Youth of Quality and Fortune is wrapt up from the whole&s;ome Keenne&s;s of the Air: And thus becomes incapable of enduring the natural Rigours of his own Climate.</P>
<P>'TIS odds, indeed, but the Prevalence of Fa&s;hion places him in &s;ome public School, where the learned Languages are taught: And, to do Ju&s;tice to the Times, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among the&s;e Semi|naries
<PB N="31" REF="28">
were never more ably &s;upplied than at pre&s;ent. But whatever be the Ma&s;ter's Ability, the Scholar's can in general reach no farther than to <HI>Words;</HI> this fir&s;t Stage of Education, therefore, can only be prepa|ratory to a higher; without which, the other is defeated of its Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>HERE, then, lies an e&s;&s;ential Defect in modern Education. The Pupil is not carried on from <HI>Words</HI> to <HI>Things.</HI> The <HI>Univer&s;ities,</HI> where the Principles of <HI>Know|ledge</HI> &s;hould be imbibed, are growing daily thinner of young Men of Quality and Fortune. In&s;tead of being initiated in <HI>Books,</HI> where the Wi&s;dom of Ages lies re|po&s;ed, our untutored Youth are carried into the <HI>World;</HI> where the ruling Objects that catch the Imagination, are the Sallies of Folly or of Vice.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="29">

<P>BUT here, it mu&s;t not be di&s;gui&s;ed; that an Abu&s;e, through Time, hath in&s;en&s;ibly crept upon the <HI>Univer&s;ities</HI> them&s;elves, and greatly impaired their U&s;e and Credit. The public Fountains of In&s;truction are at length dried up; and the <HI>Profe&s;&s;or&s;hips,</HI> founded as the Means of general In&s;truction, dege|nerated into gainful <HI>Sine-cures.</HI> In&s;tead of the&s;e, where, by a proper Choice, every Department would naturally be filled with Ability in its re&s;pective Science; the <HI>pri|vate</HI> Lectures of <HI>College-Tutors</HI> have u&s;urped
<PB N="33" REF="30">
and occupied their Place. Thus the great Lines of Knowledge are broken, and the Fragments retailed at all Adventures, by <HI>every Member</HI> of a College, who chu&s;eth to erect him&s;elf into a <HI>Profe&s;&s;or of every Sci|ence.</HI> What can be the Con&s;equence of this Practice, but a <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>&s;uperficial In&s;truction?</HI> 'Tis true, there are in this Sphere, who would do Honour to the high|e&s;t Academical Station: But what an Ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Lu&s;tre, Fame, and Knowledge, would our Univer&s;ities receive, were the&s;e <HI>few,</HI> now confined to the narrow Sphere of <HI>particular</HI> Colleges, ordained and <HI>appointed</HI> to <HI>illuminate</HI> the <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER would it reflect any Di&s;honour on our Univer&s;ities, if the few young Men of Fa&s;hion yet found there, were laid under the &s;ame Re&s;traints of moral and literary Di&s;cipline, with tho&s;e of inferior Quality.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="31">
THE next Error that pre&s;ents it&s;elf to Ob&s;ervation, is that of &s;ending our ignorant Youth abroad. A Mind &s;tored with Ta&s;te and Knowledge, will indeed naturally re|fine that Ta&s;te, and increa&s;e that Know|ledge, by &s;eeing and <HI>judging</HI> of foreign Countries. For thus he acquires a large Addition of new Experiences and Exam|ples, which may confirm or rectify his prior Ob&s;ervations. On the contrary, we may affirm, with Truth, that no Circum&s;tance in Education can more &s;urely tend to &s;trengthen Effeminacy and Ignorance, than the pre&s;ent premature, and indige&s;ted <HI>Tra|vel.</HI> For as the unin&s;tructed Youth mu&s;t needs meet with a Variety of Example, good and bad, vile and prai&s;e-worthy, as his Man|ners are childi&s;h, and his Judgment crude, he will naturally imbibe what is mo&s;t con|&s;entaneous with his puerile Habits. Thus, while Wi&s;dom and Virtue can find no Place
<PB N="35" REF="32">
in him, every Foreign Folly, Effeminacy, or Vice, meeting with a corre&s;pondent Soil, at once take Root and flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e him <HI>not</HI> of that Rank or Fortune, which may demand or admit of the grand Tour; he is then brought up to <HI>London,</HI> and initiated in the Plea&s;ures of the Metropolis. Here then let us view him, in&s;pired with every fa&s;hionable Ambition; while we take an impartial E&s;timate of tho&s;e Amu&s;ements, or rather Employments, which attract the Attention of the Town, and form the Genius and Character of the pre&s;ent and ri&s;ing Generation.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t and capital Article of Town-Effeminacy is that of <HI>Dre&s;s:</HI> which, in all its Variety of modern Exce&s;s and Ridicule, is too low for &s;erious Animadver&s;ion. Yet in this, mu&s;t every Man of every Rank and Age employ his Mornings, who pretends to keep <HI>good Company.</HI> The wi&s;e&s;t, the mo&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="33">
virtuous, the mo&s;t polite, if defective in the&s;e exterior and unmanly Delicacies, are avoided as <HI>low People,</HI> whom <HI>Nobody knows,</HI> and with whom one is <HI>a&s;hamed to be &s;een.</HI></P>
<P>How would he have been derided in the Days of ELIZABETH, when a great Queen rode on Hor&s;eback to <HI>St. Paul's,</HI> who &s;hould have foretold, that in le&s;s than two Centuries no Man of Fa&s;hion would cro&s;s the Street to Dinner, without the ef|feminate Covering and Conveyance of an <HI>ea&s;y Chair?</HI></P>
<P>YET thus accoutred, the modern Man of Fa&s;hion is <HI>conveyed</HI> to Company. Where|ever he goes, he meets the &s;ame fal&s;e De|licacy in all: Every Circum&s;tance of mo|dern U&s;e con&s;pires to &s;ooth him into the Exce&s;s of Effeminacy: Warm Carpets are &s;pread under his Feet; warm Hangings
<PB N="37" REF="34">
&s;urround him; Doors and Windows nicely jointed prevent the lea&s;t rude Encroach|ment of the external Air.</P>
<P>VANITY lends her Aid to this unmanly Delicacy: Splendid Furniture, a &s;umptu|ous Side-board, a long Train of Attendants, an elegant and co&s;tly Entertainment, for which Earth, Air, and Seas, are ran&s;acked, the mo&s;t expen&s;ive Wines of the Continent, the childi&s;h Vagaries of a whim&s;ical De&s;ert, the&s;e are the &s;upreme Pride of the Ma&s;ter, the Admiration or Envy of his Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>LUXURY is not idle in her Province, but &s;hares with her Si&s;ter Vanity, in the La|bours of the Day. High Soups and Sauces, every Mode of foreign Cookery that can quicken Ta&s;te, and &s;pur the lagging Ap|petite, is a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed. The End of Eating is not the allaying of natural Hun|ger,
<PB N="38" REF="35">
but the Gratification of fordid and de|ba&s;ing Appetite. Hence the mo&s;t inflaming Foods, not tho&s;e which <HI>nouri&s;h,</HI> but tho&s;e which <HI>irritate,</HI> are adopted; while the cool and temperate Diets that purify the Blood, are bani&s;hed to inferior Tables. To this every Man of Ta&s;te now a&s;pires, as to the true <HI>&s;&ccedil;avoir vivre.</HI></P>
<P>Do you expect in the&s;e fa&s;hionable Meetings, to hear &s;ome Point of Morals, Ta&s;te in Arts or Literature, di&s;cour&s;ed or canva&s;&s;ed? Alas! the&s;e are long &s;ince ex|pelled from every modi&s;h A&s;&s;embly. To &s;peak any thing that carries Weight and Importance, is an Offence again&s;t Good|breeding. The &s;upreme Elegance is, to trifle agreeably.</P>
<P>BUT as In&s;ipidity of Conver&s;ation is &s;oon worn out, and as Intemperance in Wine is
<PB N="39" REF="36">
not of the Character of refined Luxury; &s;o, to prevent the Stagnation of Folly, &s;ome awakening Amu&s;ement is naturally &s;ought for.</P>
<P>WE read in ancient Story, that in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed Court of the mo&s;t refined Period, a Reward was proclaimed to him, who &s;hould invent a new Plea&s;ure. This may ju&s;tly be &s;tyled, the la&s;t wretched Ef|&s;ort of bungling and de&s;pairing Luxury.&mdash;The great De&s;ideratum is at length found: A Plea&s;ure which ab&s;orbs the whole Man; a Plea&s;ure in which there is no Satiety; which cloys not by U&s;e, but gains new Vigour from Enjoyment. The Vulgar only can need to be informed, that the Plea&s;ure here alluded to, is that of GAM|ING.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="37">
BUT as the pre&s;ent increa&s;ing Splendor of Dre&s;s, Equipage, Furniture, Enter|&mdash;tainments, is enormou&s;ly expen&s;ive; what can &s;o naturally create a Lu&s;t of Gold, as the vain Ambition of Equality or Superio|rity in this Sy&s;tem of effeminate Shew? Hence, <HI>Rapacity</HI> attends <HI>Profu&s;ion;</HI> till the Spirit of Avarice glides &s;ecretly into the Soul; and impels the Man of Fa&s;hion to that <HI>Gaming,</HI> as a <HI>Trade,</HI> which he had be|fore adopted as a <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI> But as we read that CAESAR's Lu&s;t was only the <HI>Servant</HI> of his <HI>Ambition,</HI> &s;o this Lu&s;t of Gold is no more than the <HI>Handmaid</HI> to vain <HI>Effemi|nacy.</HI></P>

<P>A KNOWLEDGE of Books, a Ta&s;te in Arts, a Proficiency in Science, was for|merly regarded as a proper Qualification, in a Man of Fa&s;hion. The Annals of our Country have tran&s;mitted to us the Name and Memory of Men, as eminent in Learning and Ta&s;te, as in Rank and For|tune.
<PB N="42" REF="39">
It will not, I pre&s;ume, be regarded as any kind of Satire on the pre&s;ent Age, to &s;ay, that among the higher Ranks, this literary Spirit is generally vani&s;hed. <HI>Reading</HI> is now &s;unk at be&s;t into a Morning's <HI>Amu&s;e|ment;</HI> till the important Hour of Dre&s;s comes on. Books are no longer regarded as the Repo&s;itories of Ta&s;te and Know|ledge; but are rather laid hold of, as a gentle Relaxation from the tedious Round of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT what kind of Reading mu&s;t <HI>that</HI> be, which can attract or entertain the lan|guid Morning-Spirit of modern Effemi|nacy? Any, indeed, that can but pre|vent the un&s;upportable Toil of <HI>Thinking;</HI> that may &s;erve as a preparatory <HI>Whet</HI> of <HI>In|dolence,</HI> to the approaching Plea&s;ures of the Day. Thus it comes to pa&s;s, that weekly E&s;&s;ays, amatory Plays and Novels, politi|cal

Pamphlets, and Books that revile Re|ligion; together with a general <HI>Ha&s;h</HI> of the&s;e, &s;erved up in &s;ome <HI>monthly Me&s;s</HI> of <HI>Dulne&s;s,</HI> are the meagre <HI>literary Diet</HI> of Town and Country.</P>
<P>TRUE it is, that amid&s;t this general De|fect of Ta&s;te and Learning, there is <HI>a Writer,</HI> who&s;e Force of Genius, and Ex|tent of Knowledge, might almo&s;t redeem the Character of the Times. But that Su|periority, which attracts the Reverence of the <HI>Few,</HI> excites the Envy and Hatred of the <HI>Many:</HI> And while his Works are tran|&s;lated and admired <HI>Abroad,</HI> and patronized at <HI>Home,</HI> by tho&s;e who are mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in Genius, Ta&s;te, and Learning, him&s;elf is abu&s;ed, and his Friends in&s;ulted for his Sake, by tho&s;e who never read his Writings, or, if they did, could neither <HI>ta&s;te</HI> nor <HI>comprehend</HI> them: while every

<P>No wonder, if the&s;e leading Characters of fal&s;e Delicacy influence our other En|tertainments, and be attended with a low and unmanly Ta&s;te in <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI> That divine
<PB N="46" REF="43">
Art, capable of in&s;piring every thing that is great or excellent, of rouzing every no|bler Pa&s;&s;ion of the Soul, is at length dwindled into a Woman's or an Eunuch's effeminate Trill. The cha&s;te and &s;olemn Airs of CORELLI, of GEMINIANI, and their be&s;t Di&s;ciples; the divine and lofty Flights of CALDARA and MARCELLO; the elegant Simplicity of BONONCINI; the manly, the pathetic, the a&s;toni&s;hing Strains of HANDEL, are neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed: While in&s;tead of the&s;e, our Con|certs and Operas are di&s;graced with the lowe&s;t In&s;ipidity of Compo&s;ition, and un|meaning <HI>Sing-Song.</HI> The Que&s;tion now concerns not the Expre&s;&s;ion, the Grace, the Energy, or Dignity of the Mu&s;ick: We go not to admire the <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> but the <HI>Tricks</HI> of the <HI>Performer;</HI> who is then &s;ure&s;t of our ignorant Applau&s;e, when he runs through the Compa&s;s of the <HI>Throat,</HI>

<P>WHILE <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> is thus deba&s;ed into Effe|minacy, her Si&s;ter-Art of <HI>Painting</HI> cannot hope a better Fate: For the &s;ame Dignity of Manners mu&s;t <HI>&s;upport;</HI> the &s;ame Indig|nity <HI>depre&s;s</HI> them.

Neither the comic Pencil, nor the &s;erious Pen of our ingenious Countryman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hogarth's</HI> Treati&s;e on the Principles of Beauty.</NOTE>, have been able to keep alive the Ta&s;te of Nature, or of Beauty.

<P>LET us then &s;earch the Theatre for the Remains of manly Ta&s;te: And <HI>here,</HI> ap|parently at lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be acknowledged we &s;hall find it. A great Genius hath ari&s;en to dignify the Stage; who, when it was &s;inking into the lowe&s;t In&s;ipidity, re|&s;tored it to the Fulne&s;s of its ancient Splen|dor, and, with a Variety of Powers beyond Example, e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Nature, Shake&s;pear,</HI> and <HI>Him&s;elf.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Of Principles.</HEAD>
<P>MOST Writers, who have attempted to prove the Efficacy of Principle, have &s;up|po&s;ed it to be the great and univer&s;al Foun|tain of Manners: They who have e&s;pou&s;ed the oppo&s;ite Sy&s;tem, ob&s;erving this Theory to be at variance with Fact, have ra&s;hly concluded that Principle is void of all real Influence.</P>
<P>THE Truth &s;eems to lie between the&s;e two Opinions. Principles cannot be the Fountain of Manners, becau&s;e Manners precede Principles: That is, in our Pro|gre&s;s from Infancy, Habits of <HI>Acting</HI> are <HI>prior</HI> to Habits of <HI>Thinking.</HI> Yet on the other Hand, Principles, early and deeply ingrafted in the Mind, may grow up with
<PB N="53" REF="50">
Manners; may be at variance with Man|ners; may yield to Manners; or, gathering Strength by Cultivation, may check, con|troll, or de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;tinction is proper for many Rea&s;ons. One is evident: It &s;hews the Propriety of treating of the Manners <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and <HI>then</HI> the Principles of the Times.</P>

DID the Writer court the Applau&s;e of his polite Readers (if any &s;uch peradven|ture may honour him with their Regard) he would preface this Part of his Subject with an Apology, for the Rudene&s;s of hint|ing at <HI>religious Principle.</HI> To &s;uppo&s;e a Man of Fa&s;hion &s;wayed in his Conduct by a Regard to <HI>Futurity,</HI> is an Affront to the Delicacy and Refinement of his <HI>Ta&s;te.</HI> Hence the Day &s;et apart by the Laws of his Country for religious Service, he derides and affronts as a <HI>vulgar</HI> and <HI>ob&s;olete</HI> In&s;titu|tution: Should you propo&s;e to him the Re|newal of that <HI>Family Devotion,</HI> which con|cluded the guiltle&s;s Evening Entertainments of his Ance&s;try?

<P>IN Confirmation of the&s;e Truths, we may conclude this Part of our Subject with a not incurious Anecdote. A certain Hi&s;|torian of our own Times, bent upon <HI>Popu|larity</HI> and <HI>Gain,</HI> publi&s;hed a large Volume, and omitted no Opportunity that offered, to di&s;grace Religion: A large Impre&s;&s;ion was publi&s;hed, and a &s;mall Part &s;old. The Author being a&s;ked, why he had &s;o larded his Work with Irreligion, his An&s;wer mode&s;tly implied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He had done it, that his Book might &s;ell."</Q>&mdash;It was whi&s;pered him, that he had totally mi&s;taken the Spirit of the Times: that no Allurements could engage the <HI>fa&s;hionable</HI> Infidel World to travel through a large Quarto: And that as the
<PB N="58" REF="55">
few Readers of Quarto's that yet remain, lie mo&s;tly among the &s;erious Part of Man|kind, he had offended his be&s;t Cu&s;tomers, and ruined the Sale of his Book. This In|formation had a notable Effect: for a &s;e|cond Volume, as large and in&s;tructive as the fir&s;t, hath appeared; not a Smack of Irreligion is to be found in it; and an Apo|logy for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> concludes the whole.</P>
<P>THIS being the State of religious Prin|ciple, let us next examine how it fares with the <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Honour.</HI> By this is meant, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The De&s;ire of Fame, or the Ap|plau&s;e of Men, directed to the End of public Happine&s;s."</Q> Now this great Am|bition, which in other Times or Nations hath wrought &s;uch wonderful Effects, is no longer to be found among us. It is the Pride of <HI>Equipage,</HI> the Pride of <HI>Title,</HI> the Pride of <HI>Fortune,</HI> or the Pride of <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> that
<PB N="59" REF="56">
have a&s;&s;umed the Empire over our Souls, and levelled <HI>Ambition</HI> with the <HI>Dirt.</HI> The hone&s;t Pride of <HI>Virtue</HI> is <HI>no more;</HI> or, where it happens to exi&s;t, is overwhelmed by in|ferior Vanities. A Man who &s;hould go out of the common Road of Life, in Pur|&s;uit of Glory, and &s;erve the Public at the Expence of his Ea&s;e, his Fortune, or his Plea&s;ure, would be &s;tared or laughed at in every fa&s;hionable Circle, as a &s;illy Fellow, who meddled with Things that did not be|long to him: As an Ideot, who preferred Shadows to Realities, and needle&s;s Toil to plea&s;urable Enjoyment. The laurel Wreath, once a&s;pired after as the highe&s;t Object of Ambition, would now be rated at the Market-price of its Materials, and derided as a <HI>three-penny Crown.</HI> And if its modern Sub&s;titutes, the <HI>Ribbon</HI> or the <HI>Coronet,</HI> be eagerly &s;ought for, it is not that they are regarded as the <HI>Di&s;tinctions</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="57">
of <HI>public Virtue,</HI> but as the <HI>En&s;igns</HI> of <HI>Va|nity</HI> and <HI>Place.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what implies or proves the gene|ral Extinction of the Principle of Honour, is a peculiar Circum&s;tance, which at fir&s;t View &s;eems to challenge Prai&s;e. It hath been weakly attributed to the moderate and forgiving Spirit of the&s;e Times, that no Age ever &s;o patiently &s;uffered its ruling Follies to be laughed at. But this, in truth, is a &s;uperficial and inadequate Repre&s;enta|tion, as well as Solution, of the Fact. We not only &s;uffer our ruling Vices and Follies to be ridiculed, but we cordially join in the Laugh. Was there ever a ju&s;ter Picture drawn, than of modern <HI>Effeminacy</HI> and <HI>Nonchalance</HI> in the Characters of FRIBBLE and Lord CHALKSTONE? Did ever dra|matic Characters rai&s;e louder Peals of Laughter and Applau&s;e, even among tho&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="58">
who &s;at for the Likene&s;s? They hear with Plea&s;ure, they acknowledge the Truth of the Repre&s;entation, they laugh at the Picture of their own Follies; they go home, and <HI>without a Blu&s;h repeat them.</HI> The Truth is, therefore, that we can &s;ee and own our Vices and Follies, <HI>without being touched with Shame:</HI> a Circum&s;tance which ancient Times ju&s;tly regarded as the &s;tronge&s;t Indication of de|generate and incorrigible Manners.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that the Principle of Honour is either lo&s;t, or totally corrupted: That no generous Thir&s;t of Prai&s;e is left among us: That our Ambitions are trifling and unmanly as our Plea&s;ures: That Wealth, Titles, Dre&s;s, Equipage, Sagacity in Gaming or Wagers, &s;plendid Furniture and a Table, are the &s;ole Fountains, from which we de&s;ire to draw Re&s;pect to our|&s;elves, or Applau&s;e from others: We a&s;|pire
<PB N="62" REF="59">
to Folly, and are proud of Meanne&s;s: Thus, the Principle of <HI>Honour</HI> is perverted, and dwindled into <HI>unmanly Vanity.</HI></P>
<P>CAN it be imagined, that, amid&s;t this ge|neral Defect of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> the great and comprehen&s;ive Principle of <HI>pub|lic Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Love of our Country,</HI> can gain a Place in our Brea&s;ts? That mighty Prin|ciple, &s;o often feigned, &s;o &s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; which requires the united Force of upright <HI>Manners,</HI> generous <HI>Religion,</HI> and unfeigned <HI>Honour,</HI> to &s;upport it. What Strength of Thought or con&s;cious Merit can there be in effeminate Minds, &s;ufficient to ele|vate them to this Principle, who&s;e Ob|ject is, <Q REND="inline">"the Happine&s;s of a Kingdom?"</Q> To &s;peak therefore without Flattery, this Principle is perhaps le&s;s felt among us, than even tho&s;e of Religion and true Honour. So infatuated are we in our Contempt of this powerful Principle, that we deride
<PB N="63" REF="60">
the Inhabitants of a <HI>Si&s;ter-Kingdom,</HI> for their <HI>national Attachments</HI> and <HI>Regards.</HI> So little are we accu&s;tomed to go, or even <HI>think,</HI> beyond the beaten Track of private Intere&s;t, in all Things that regard our <HI>Country;</HI> that he who merely does his <HI>Duty</HI> in any con&s;picuous Station, is looked on as a Prodigy of public Virtue. But in other Times and Nations, when this Principle was in Force, Enterpri&s;es were formed, and Deeds done, which it would now be thought Phrenzy to attempt. Think what a Friend will do for a Friend; a Si&s;ter for a Brother, a Lover for his Mi&s;tre&s;s, a Pa|rent for his Child; even <HI>that,</HI> in all its Fulne&s;s of Affection, in other Times and Nations, hath been the Aim and the Work of public Virtue, <HI>doing</HI> or <HI>&s;uffering</HI> for its <HI>Country's Welfare.</HI></P>
<P>DOMESTIC Affections are not yet gene|rally extingui&s;hed: There are kind Fa|thers,
<PB N="64" REF="61">
kind Mothers, affectionate Children, Si&s;ters, Brothers: Humanity to Di&s;tre&s;s, we have already marked as another Cha|racter of the Times: But whether our very Effeminacy be not one of its Sources, might probably be a Que&s;tion more <HI>curious</HI> in its Progre&s;s, than <HI>agreeable</HI> in its Solution.</P>
<P>HOWEVER that be, let us be mode&s;t in our Claims, and confe&s;s, that our Affecti|ons &s;eldom reach farther than our Rela|tions, our Friends, or Individuals in Di|&s;tre&s;s. Happy (in the pre&s;ent) it is for us, that they reach &s;o far. Happy were it for us, or our Po&s;terity, that they were of more inlarged Extent. In the mean Time, let us with due Aba&s;ement of Heart acknow|ledge, that the <HI>Love</HI> of our <HI>Country</HI> is no longer felt; and that, except in a few Minds of uncommon Greatne&s;s, the Prin|ciple of <HI>public Spirit</HI> EXISTS NOT.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="62">
IT is not affirmed or implied, in this general Review, that <HI>every Individual</HI> hath a&s;&s;umed the Garb and Character of fal&s;e Delicacy, and uncontrouled Self-Love: As in <HI>manly</HI> Ages, &s;ome will be <HI>effeminate;</HI> &s;o, in <HI>effeminate</HI> Times, the <HI>manly</HI> Cha|racter will be found: As in Times of Prin|ciple, &s;ome will be void of Principle; &s;o, in Times when Principle is derided, in &s;ome &s;uperior Minds Principle will be found. But from the general Combination of Man|ners and Principles, in every Period of Time, will always re&s;ult one ruling and predominant Character; as from a con|fu&s;ed Multitude of different Voices, re&s;ults one general Murmur, and &s;trikes the di|&s;tant Ear; or from a Field covered with Flocks, Herds, or Armies, though vari|ous in them&s;elves, re&s;ults one general and permanent Colour, and &s;trikes the di&s;tant Eye:</P>

<P>IT is enough, then, if from a proper <HI>Point of View,</HI> we have fixed the <HI>ruling Colour</HI> of the Manners and Principles, for on this will depend the <HI>ruling Character</HI> of the <HI>Times.</HI></P>
<P>AS it appears, therefore, from this De|lineation, that SHOW and PLEASURE are the main Objects of Pur&s;uit: As the gene|ral Habit of <HI>refined Indulgence</HI> is <HI>&s;trong,</HI> and the Habit of <HI>induring</HI> is <HI>lo&s;t:</HI> As the ge|neral Spirit of <HI>Religion, Honour,</HI> and <HI>pub|lick Love,</HI> are weakened or vani&s;hed; as

<P><PB N="74" REF="69">IT was a &s;hrewd Ob&s;ervation of a good old Writer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How can he get Wi&s;dom, who&s;e Talk is of Bullocks <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book of Wi&s;dom.</NOTE>?"</Q> But <HI>Ru&s;|ticity</HI> is not more an Enemy of Knowledge, than <HI>Effeminacy:</HI> With the &s;ame Pro|priety therefore it may now be a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How can he get Wi&s;dom, who&s;e Talk is of <HI>Dre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Wagers, Cards</HI> and <HI>Borough-jobbing, Hor&s;es, Women,</HI> and <HI>Dice?"</HI></Q> The Man of Fa&s;hion is indeed cut off from the very Means of &s;olid In|&s;truction.

<P>IT is true, that in every A&s;&s;embly of this Kind, the public Mea&s;ures will gene|rally be determined by the <HI>Few,</HI> who&s;e Su|periority is approved and acknowledged: By the <HI>Few,</HI> who have been &s;o unfa&s;hio|nable as to de&s;pi&s;e the ruling Sy&s;tem of Effeminacy: and before they had ap|peared on a <HI>higher Stage,</HI> had <HI>laboured</HI> and <HI>&s;hone</HI> in a <HI>College.</HI> But what an Increa&s;e of <HI>national Capacity</HI> mu&s;t ari&s;e, if tho&s;e <HI>Ma&s;ter-Spirits</HI> were aided, and their Plans of Government examined and improved, by Men of the like <HI>Application</HI> and <HI>Ability?</HI></P>

BUT if, in any Nation, the Number of the&s;e &s;uperior Minds be daily decrea&s;ing, from the growing Manners of the Times; what can a Nation, &s;o circum&s;tanced, have more to fear, than that in another Age, a general Cloud of Ignorance may over|&s;hadow it?</P>
<P>How much, or how little, in this Par|ticular, <HI>we</HI> re&s;emble the declining State of the <HI>Roman</HI> Republic, let any one determine from the following Pa&s;&s;age: Where the great Author, after celebrating the general <HI>Ability</HI> of tho&s;e who were <HI>formerly</HI> in pub|lic Station, concludes thus: <Q LANG="lat" REND="inline margQuotes">"Nunc con|tra, plerique ad honores adipi&s;cendos, et ad rempublicam gerendam, <HI>nudi</HI> veniunt atque <HI>inermes,</HI> nulla cognitione rerum, nulla &s;cientia ornati <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cic. de Oratore, l. iii.</NOTE>."</Q></P>

'TIS true, indeed, that in barbarous Ages, there want not In&s;tances of unlearn|ed Leaders, who have done mighty Acti|ons in Battle.

<P>THERE is another <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> which, un|der this Article of the <HI>national Capacity,</HI> the vulgar Reader will naturally expect to find con&s;idered. I mean, that of the <HI>Clergy.</HI> But the general Defect of religious Principle among the higher Ranks, hath rendered this order of Men altogether u&s;ele&s;s, except among tho&s;e in <HI>middle Life,</HI> where they &s;till maintain a certain Degree of E&s;timation. The Contempt with which not <HI>they,</HI> but their
<PB N="83" REF="78">
<HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> is treated by the <HI>Ignorant</HI> and <HI>Profligate,</HI> is equally common indeed to <HI>high</HI> and <HI>low</HI> Life: A Circum&s;tance, which may be an Occa&s;ion of <HI>Pride</HI> in the <HI>one,</HI> but ought rather to be Matter of <HI>Humilia|tion</HI> to the other.

<P>AND although the pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable Contempt that is thrown upon their
<PB N="84" REF="79">
<HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> preclude the Clergy from the <HI>Opportunity,</HI> had they the <HI>Will,</HI> to practice that Chri&s;tian Duty of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"over|coming Evil with Good;</Q> yet they need not blu&s;h to find, that they have <HI>fallen</HI> with the <HI>Fame,</HI> the <HI>Manners,</HI> and <HI>Princi|ples</HI> of their Country: nor can the worthy Part of them, &s;ure, a&s;pire to <HI>truer Glory,</HI> than to have become the <HI>Contempt</HI> of <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> who are become the <HI>Contempt of</HI> EUROPE.</P>
<P>BUT while I defend and <HI>honour</HI> the <HI>Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,</HI> I mean not to flatter the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors.</HI> As far, therefore, as the Influence of <HI>their</HI> Conduct and Knowledge can be &s;uppo&s;ed to affect the <HI>national Capacity;</HI> &s;o far, they &s;eem falling into the &s;ame unmanly and effeminate Peculiarities, by which their Contemporaries are di&s;tingui&s;hed: Such of them, I mean, as have Opportunity of conver&s;ing with what is called <HI>the World,</HI>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the national Spirit of Defence.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;een how the Manners of the Times have levelled the national <HI>Capacity;</HI> let us next enquire how it fares with the national Spirit of <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
<P>As this Part of our Subject naturally in|volves a larger Number of the Community than the la&s;t, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, here, to take a larger Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>THE national Spirit of <HI>Defence</HI> then, to &s;peak with Preci&s;ion, will always be com|pounded
<PB N="88" REF="83">
of the national bodily <HI>Strength, Hardine&s;s, Courage,</HI> and <HI>Principle.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>common People</HI> of this Nation &s;eem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>three</HI> fir&s;t of the&s;e four Qualities, in a Degree &s;ufficient to form an effectual and national Spirit of Defence. And though they who are &s;elected for pub|lic <HI>Service</HI> be commonly mo&s;t <HI>profligate</HI> in Manners, yet as their <HI>Sphere</HI> of Action is <HI>confined,</HI> they commonly have a proporti|oned <HI>kind of Principle,</HI> which works its Effect in Battle. In the Land Service, they are zealous for the <HI>Honour</HI> of their <HI>Platoon,</HI> their <HI>Company,</HI> their <HI>Regiment.</HI> At Sea, there is the &s;ame Emulation, who&s;e <HI>Gun,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Ship,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Squadron,</HI> &s;hall be be&s;t <HI>&s;erved</HI> and <HI>fought.</HI> It is well known there are no better fighting Men upon Earth. They &s;eldom turn their Backs upon their Enemy, unle&s;s when their
<PB N="89" REF="84">
Officers &s;hew the Way; and even then, are ea&s;ily rallied; and return to the Charge with the &s;ame Courage.</P>
<P>THUS our <HI>Villages</HI> and <HI>Ports</HI> are an effectual Fund of Supplies for the national Spirit of Defence, in its inferior Depart|ments.</P>
<P>BUT if we ri&s;e, or rather <HI>de&s;cend,</HI> to an impartial View of tho&s;e who are called the <HI>better Sort,</HI> we &s;hall find &s;uch a general Defect in the Spirit of <HI>Defence,</HI> as would alarm any People who were not lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of <HI>Danger.</HI></P>
<P>OUR effeminate and unmanly Life, working along with our I&s;land-Climate, hath notoriou&s;ly produced an Increa&s;e of <HI>low Spirits</HI> and <HI>nervous Di&s;orders,</HI> who&s;e
<PB N="90" REF="85">
natural and unalterable Character is that of <HI>Fear.</HI></P>
<P>AND even where this Di&s;temper <HI>is not,</HI> the pre&s;ent fal&s;e Delicacy of the fa&s;hio|nable World effectually di&s;qualifies them from <HI>enduring Toil,</HI> or <HI>facing Danger.</HI></P>
<P>ENTHUSIASTIC Religion leads to <HI>Con|que&s;ts;</HI> rational Religion leads to rational <HI>Defence;</HI> but the modern Spirit of <HI>Irreligion</HI> leads to <HI>ra&s;cally</HI> and abandoned <HI>Cowardice.</HI> It quenceth every generous Hope that can enlarge the Soul; and levels Mankind with the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</P>
<P>CAN the Debility of modern Honour produce the manly Spirit of Defence? Alas, if ever it is put in Action by any thing beyond the <HI>Vanity</HI> of <HI>Shew;</HI> it is rouzed by an <HI>Affront,</HI> and dies in a <HI>Duel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="86">
How far this da&s;tard Spirit of Effemi|nacy hath crept upon us, and de&s;troyed the national Spirit of Defence, may appear from the general <HI>Panic</HI> the Nation was thrown into, at the late <HI>Rebellion.</HI> When tho&s;e of every Rank above a Con&s;table, in&s;tead of arming them&s;elves and encourag|ing the <HI>People,</HI> generally fled before the <HI>Rebels;</HI> while a Mob of ragged Highland|ers marched unmole&s;ted to the Heart of a populous Kingdom.</P>
<P>NAY, &s;o general was this cowardly and effeminate Spirit, that it was not confined to the <HI>Friends</HI> of Liberty and <HI>Britain:</HI> In <HI>England,</HI> it infected even their <HI>Enemies:</HI> who, while the hardy <HI>Scots</HI> ri&s;qued their Lives in a &s;trange Country, amid&s;t the In|clemencies of a &s;evere Sea&s;on, &s;at like Cowards by the Chimney Corner, tamely
<PB N="92" REF="87">
wi&s;hing the Succe&s;s of that Mi&s;chief, which their effeminate Manners dur&s;t not propagate.</P>
<P>IT hath been urged indeed, as a Proof that the national Spirit of Defence is not yet extingui&s;hed, that we rai&s;ed &s;uch large Sums during that Rebellion, and &s;till con|tinue &s;uch plentiful Supplies for the Support of our Fleets and Armies. This is weak Rea&s;oning: For will not <HI>Cowardice,</HI> at lea&s;t as &s;oon as <HI>Courage,</HI> part with a Shil|ling or a Pound, to avoid <HI>Danger?</HI> The capital Que&s;tion therefore &s;till remains, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not who &s;hall <HI>Pay,</HI> but who &s;hall <HI>Fight?"</HI></Q></P>
<P>MONEY, it is true, hath of late more than ever, been among <HI>us</HI> regarded as the main <HI>Engine of War:</HI> How truly, let our <HI>Succe&s;&s;es</HI> tell the World.&mdash;This Point will

hereafter be treated more at large <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Part the Third.</NOTE>. In the mean Time, it cannot be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that a <HI>little</HI> of the active <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Courage</HI> would do well, in order to <HI>give Play</HI> to this boa&s;ted <HI>Engine,</HI> which other|wi&s;e may &s;ink into a <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>unactive Ma&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>FOR a natural Di&s;play, therefore, of the Genius of the Times, commend me to the frank Declaration of an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Gentleman, during the impending Terror of a <HI>French</HI> Inva&s;ion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For my Part, I am no <HI>Sol|dier;</HI> and therefore think it no Di&s;grace, to own my&s;elf <HI>a Coward.

HOW many modern fine Gentlemen, notwith&s;tanding the warlike Weapon at their Side, would make the &s;ame <HI>Decla|ration,</HI> had they the &s;ame <HI>Sincerity?</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another Circum&s;tance in modern Manners, the Con&s;ideration of which mu&s;t not be omitted becau&s;e at fir&s;t View it bids fair for the Spirit of De|fence among the <HI>Great:</HI> I mean, the Spirit of <HI>deliberate Self-murder:</HI> For this ran high in ancient GREECE and ROME, when the Spirit of <HI>Defence</HI> was <HI>&s;trong.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the clearing of this Point, it mu&s;t be premi&s;ed and confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;omething <HI>like</HI> the Principle of <HI>Honour,</HI> that is, the <HI>Dread</HI> of <HI>Infamy</HI> and <HI>Shame,</HI> appears the leading Motive in both In&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="90">
BUT a farther Dictinction is to be made, with Regard to the different Objects of this <HI>Fear:</HI> And for this, we mu&s;t refer to a former Section *. There we have &s;een, that the ruling <HI>Pride</HI> of a <HI>modern</HI> man of Fa&s;hion, lies in the Parade of <HI>Dre&s;s, Gaming, Entertainments,</HI> and <HI>Equipage:</HI> whereas, on the contrary, the <HI>Ambition</HI> of an old <HI>Roman,</HI> was, to excel in <HI>military Virtue.</HI> Now this Dictinction at once clears up the Que&s;tion we are upon, and confirms much of what hath been advanced on modern Principles and Manners. The <HI>Roman</HI> killed him&s;elf, becau&s;e he had been unfortunate in <HI>War;</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> be|cau&s;e he hath been unfortunate at <HI>Whi&s;t:</HI> The <HI>old</HI> Hero, becau&s;e he had <HI>di&s;graced</HI> his <HI>Country;</HI> the <HI>modern,</HI> becau&s;e he dares not &s;hew his Head at <HI>Arthur's:</HI> That, <NOTE PLACE="foot">Part i. Sect 6.</NOTE>
<PB N="96" REF="91">
becau&s;e he was deprived of his <HI>Glory;</HI> this, of his <HI>Ortolans</HI> and <HI>Champaigne:</HI> The fir&s;t was encouraged by a <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> Principle of Religion; the latter, by his being <HI>void</HI> of all Religion: The one, becau&s;e he had lo&s;t a <HI>Battle</HI> or a <HI>Province;</HI> the other, becau&s;e the Bailiff hath &s;eized his <HI>Equipage:</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> was impelled to <HI>Self-De&s;truction</HI> by the Strength of <HI>warlike Honour;</HI> the <HI>Bri|ton,</HI> by <HI>de&s;picable</HI> and <HI>effeminate Vanity.</HI></P>
<P>WHERE then &s;hall we &s;eek for the ge|nuine Spirit of Defence? Where, in Truth, &s;hould we mo&s;t &s;eek for it, but among tho&s;e who are our <HI>Defenders</HI> by <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion?</HI></P>
<P>BUT, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what Probability is there, that the Spirit of Defence &s;hould be &s;trong in any Profe&s;&s;ion, when the Members of that Profe&s;&s;ion are all cho&s;en, without
<PB N="97" REF="92">
prior Culture or Preparation, from a People among whom the Spirit of De|fence is lo&s;t?"</Q> The Truth implied in this Que&s;tion is &s;o evident in it&s;elf, that it is hard to go about to prove it. Can a mere Change of <HI>Dre&s;s</HI> or <HI>Title,</HI> or the buckling on a military <HI>Weapon,</HI> infu&s;e Strength, Hardine&s;s, Courage, or Honour? The&s;e are Qualities that mu&s;t either be natural, which &s;eldom happens; or they mu&s;t be in|fu&s;ed by an early and continued Di&s;cipline; or el&s;e, they come not at all. Schools and Seminaries of this Kind we have none; or none that are in any Degree attended to. The young Men de&s;igned for the military Profe&s;&s;ion are bred up to the &s;ame effemi|nate Maxims and Manners, which their Fathers are proud of: Can we wonder, if the&s;e &s;hoot into Action, and form parallel Characters? Well might we wonder if they <HI>did not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="93">
SO then, if it appear by our pre&s;ent Succe&s;s in War, that our naval and military Spirit of Defence is &s;trong, it mu&s;t be evident at the &s;ame Time, that this great Spirit is infu&s;ed by &s;ome Means altogether &s;upernatural.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, what becomes of the four great natural Hinges, on which the true Spirit of Defence mu&s;t hang, <HI>Strength, Hardine&s;s, Courage,</HI> and <HI>Prin|ciple?</HI></P>
<P>CAN the modern Sy&s;tem of fal&s;e Deli|cacy nerve the Warrior with Hardine&s;s and Strength? The&s;e Qualities, I believe, are hardly <HI>boa&s;ted,</HI> as making any Part of the modern warlike Character. It is a prudent as well as a mode&s;t Part, indeed, not to throw the&s;e rough and antiquated Weights
<PB N="99" REF="94">
into the pre&s;ent military Scale: For every common Eye would detect the fal&s;e Pre|ten&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT tho' brutal Strength and unpoli&s;hed Hardine&s;s be gone, are not our <HI>Army</HI> and <HI>Navy</HI> the great <HI>Schools</HI> of <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Honour;</HI> where the&s;e &s;hining Qualities are of Cour&s;e obtained?&mdash;Truly, it hath long been &s;o affirmed: So long, that the <HI>Affir|mation</HI> hath, till of late, pa&s;&s;ed for <HI>Proof.</HI> But the Nation is now beginning to grow <HI>&s;ceptical</HI> in this Point; and require &s;ome|thing more than <HI>Affirmation,</HI> for the Sup|port of an Article of &s;uch <HI>Importance.</HI></P>
<P>LET us fir&s;t weigh the Probability of this, from the Nature of Things and Men. True <HI>Courage</HI> and a Principle of <HI>Honour,</HI> if they be not the rare and generous Growths of <HI>Nature,</HI> are the Effect of
<PB N="100" REF="95">
<HI>early</HI> and <HI>continued Habits.</HI> Tho' <HI>grown</HI> Gentlemen may learn to <HI>Dance;</HI> yet, their Movements will be none of the mo&s;t <HI>graceful:</HI> And tho' grown Gentlemen repair to the School of Courage and Ho|nour: yet, with all their pre-conceived Maxims of fal&s;e Delicacy, their trifling Ambitions, and effeminate Manners about them, I ween, they are like to make a <HI>&s;orry Progre&s;s.</HI> Long before this, the Mind hath taken its <HI>deci&s;ive Ca&s;t</HI> of <HI>Thought,</HI> and can but rarely be brought back from its fir&s;t <HI>Obliquities.</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e the Po&s;&s;ibility of this &s;ud|den Infu&s;ion: It is to be feared, the Con|&s;equence would fail us. It is true, that when <HI>Armies</HI> take the <HI>Field,</HI> and <HI>Fleets</HI> put to <HI>Sea;</HI> when Sieges are undertaken, and Battles fought, and Glory is the Prize of Toil and Danger;&mdash;then indeed,
<PB N="101" REF="96">
Armies and Navies become the Schools of Courage and warlike Honour: Here is a &s;trong and continued Bias put upon the Mind of every Individual, of Force to conquer it's earlie&s;t Obliquities. But where nothing of this happens; where <HI>Land Officers</HI> in the Capital are occupied in <HI>Dre&s;s, Cards,</HI> and <HI>Tea;</HI> and in Country Towns divide their Time between Mil|leners <HI>Shops</HI> and <HI>Taverns;</HI> and <HI>Sea Officers,</HI> even in Time of War, in&s;tead of annoying the Enemies Fleets, are chiefly bu&s;ied in the gainful Trade of catching <HI>Prizes;&mdash;</HI>in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, the Army mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be the <HI>School,</HI> not of <HI>Honour,</HI> but <HI>Effemi|nacy;</HI> the <HI>Navy</HI> the School of <HI>Avarice,</HI> to the <HI>Ends of Effeminacy.</HI></P>
<P>HOW far the&s;e general Rea&s;onings are confirmed by a Series of <HI>recent Events,</HI> the World is left to judge. It is not the

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the national Spirit of Union.</HEAD>
<P>THESE accumulated Proofs may con|vince us, that the national Spirit of <HI>De|fence</HI> is not le&s;s weakened than the national <HI>Capacity,</HI> by the Manners and Principles of the Times. Let us next weight their various Effects on the national Spirit of <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>IT may be proper to preface this Part of the E&s;timate, by ob&s;erving, that whereas a national <HI>Capacity</HI> and Spirit of <HI>Defence</HI> are not nece&s;&s;arily affected by a national Form of <HI>Government;</HI> the national Spirit of
<PB N="103" REF="98">
<HI>Union,</HI> on the contrary, is naturally <HI>&s;trong</HI> under <HI>&s;ome</HI> Forms, and naturally <HI>weak</HI> under <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>IT is naturally <HI>&s;trong</HI> in <HI>ab&s;olute Monar|chies;</HI> becau&s;e, in the Ab&s;ence both of Manners and Principles, the <HI>compelling</HI> Power of the <HI>Prince</HI> directs and draws every thing to one Point; and therefore, in all common Situations, effectually &s;up|plies their Place.</P>
<P>BUT in <HI>free Countries</HI> it is naturally <HI>weak,</HI> unle&s;s &s;upported by the generous Principles of Religion, Honour, or public Spirit: For as in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, a full national Union will require, that the &s;eparate and partial Views of private Intere&s;t be in &s;ome Degree &s;acrificed to the general Welfare; &s;o where Principle prevails not, the national
<PB N="104" REF="99">
Union mu&s;t ever be thwarted or de&s;troyed by &s;elfi&s;h Views and &s;eparate Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Circum&s;tance mu&s;t be re|marked, by which, in free Countries, the national Union will accidentally be often checked, but not de&s;troyed: I mean, by the Freedom of <HI>Opinion</HI> it&s;elf, urged into Act by the very Strength of generous and prevailing <HI>Principle.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Di&s;tinction leads us to ob&s;erve what may perhaps be deemed an Over-fight or Inaccuracy of the celebrated MONTESQUIEU. He hath often given it as his Opinion, that <HI>Factions</HI> are not only natural, but nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>free</HI> Govern|ments: And this general Rule he gives without Re&s;triction. Thus he &s;peaks of <HI>Rome.</HI> <Q LANG="fre" REND="inline margQuotes">"On n'entend parler dans les auteurs, que des divi&s;ions qui perdirent
<PB N="105" REF="100">
Rome: mais on ne voit pas que ces Divi&s;ions y &eacute;toient <HI>nece&s;&s;aires,</HI> qu'elles y avoient toujours &eacute;t&eacute;, &amp; qu'elles y <HI>devoi|ent toujours etre</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grandeur des Rom. l. ix.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>How far this Propo&s;ition is <HI>true</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> the Di&s;tinction made above will lead us to di&s;cover. When the Spirit of Union is checked, and Divi&s;ions ari&s;e, from the Variety and <HI>Freedom</HI> of <HI>Opinion</HI> only; or from the conte&s;ted Rights and Privileges of the different Ranks or Orders of a State, not from the detached and &s;elfi&s;h Views of Individuals; a Republic is then in its <HI>Strength,</HI> and gathers Warmth and Fire from the&s;e Colli&s;ions. Such was the State of ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> in the &s;impler and more di&s;intere&s;ted Periods of that Republic.</P>
<P>BUT when Principle is weakened and Manners lo&s;t, and Factions run high from
<PB N="106" REF="101">
&s;elfi&s;h Ambition, Revenge, or Avarice, a Repubiic is then on the very Eve of its De&s;truction: And &s;uch was the State of Rome, in the Times of MARIUS and SYLLA, POMPEY and CESAR, ANTHONY and AUGUSTUS.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, before we can determine whether the <HI>Factions</HI> that divide a <HI>free</HI> Country be <HI>&s;alutary</HI> or <HI>dangerous,</HI> it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to know what is their <HI>Foundation</HI> and their <HI>Object.</HI> If they ari&s;e from <HI>Free|dom</HI> of Opinion, and aim at the public Welfare, they are <HI>&s;alutary:</HI> If their Source be <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, of what kind &s;oever; they are then <HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>de&s;tructive.</HI></P>
<P>IT was nece&s;&s;ary to make the&s;e Di&s;tinc|tions, before we could &s;ay with Preci&s;ion, how far, in our own Country, a <HI>national Spirit of Union,</HI> is in reality a <HI>national</HI> GOOD.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="102">THE Point therefore to be examined, is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how far our national Spirit of Union is weakened or de&s;troyed by &s;elfi&s;h Views of Good, by &s;eparate Intere&s;ts, and De|fect of Principle?"</Q></P>
<P>Now, if the Delineation already given of our ruling Manners and Principles be true, the Con&s;equence mu&s;t needs follow, that our national Spirit of Union mu&s;t be &s;haken by them.</P>
<P>NEITHER &s;hall we need to ca&s;t about, for evident Facts that will confirm this Theory. Glaring Proofs will meet us at every Turn; and not only make good this Conclu&s;ion, but throw new Light on the Delineation already made.</P>
<P>THE Re&s;traints laid on the royal Prero|gative at the Revolution, and the Acce&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="108" REF="103">
of Liberty thus gained by the People, produced two Effects with Re&s;pect to Par|liaments. One was that, in&s;tead of being <HI>occa&s;ionally,</HI> they were thence-forward <HI>an|nually</HI> a&s;&s;embled: The other was, that whereas on any trifling Offence given, they had been u&s;ually <HI>intimidated</HI> or <HI>di&s;&s;olved,</HI> they now found them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of new <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Power;</HI> their Con&s;ent being nece&s;&s;ary for rai&s;ing the <HI>annual Sup|plies.</HI></P>
<P>NO Body of Men, except in the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous Times, ever found them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Power, but many of them would attempt to turn it to their own private Advantage. Thus the Parlia|ments finding them&s;elves <HI>of Weight,</HI> and finding at the &s;ame Time that the Di&s;po&s;al of all <HI>lucrative Employments</HI> was ve&s;ted in the <HI>Crown,</HI> &s;oon bethought them&s;elves,
<PB N="109" REF="104">
that in Exchange for <HI>their</HI> Concurrence in granting Supplies, and forwarding the <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI> of <HI>Government,</HI> it was but equita|ble that the Crown &s;hould <HI>concur</HI> in ve&s;t|ing <HI>Them,</HI> or their <HI>Dependants,</HI> with the <HI>lu|crative Employs</HI> of State.</P>
<P>IF this was done, the Wheels of Go|vernment ran &s;mooth and quiet: But if any large Body of Claimants was di&s;&s;a|tisfied, the political Uproar began; and public Mea&s;ures were ob&s;tructed or over|turned.</P>
<P>WILLIAM the <HI>third</HI> found this to be the national Turn; and &s;et him&s;elf, like a Politician, to oppo&s;e it: He therefore &s;i|lenced all he could, by Places or Pen&s;ions: And hence the Origin of MAKING of PAR|LIAMENTS.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="105">
BUT the Art, as yet, was but in its <HI>infant</HI> State. The ruling Principles, which had brought about the REVOLUTION, had not as yet lo&s;t their Force: And the fir&s;t E&s;|&s;ays of Art are always rude: Time only, and Variety of Trial and Experiment, can form them into perfect Sy&s;tems.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, this new Principle of Self-Intere&s;t began to work deeper every Day in its Effects.

<P>IT hath much been debated, whether the Mini&s;ters or the People have contributed more to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of this Sy&s;tem of Self-Intere&s;t and Faction. On En|quiry it would probably appear, that at different Periods the Pendulum hath &s;wung at large on both &s;ides.

<HEAD>SECT. V. Of the Con&s;equences of National Di&s;union.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not enough to have &s;hewn in what Manner our Defect of Principle and ruling Manners have compleated the Ruin of the national Spirit of Union: If we would ob|tain a full View of our Subject, it is a nece&s;&s;ary tho' di&s;agreeable Ta&s;k, to trace this <HI>Di&s;union</HI> thro' its <HI>particular Effects.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the&s;e will always vary along with the Character of the People thus divided. If the Nation be <HI>warlike,</HI> and the Spirit of Defence be <HI>&s;trong,</HI> the Danger will gene|rally ari&s;e from <HI>within.</HI> If the Nation be <HI>effeminate,</HI> and the Spirit of Defence be <HI>weak,</HI> the Danger will generally ari&s;e from <HI>without.</HI></P>

The fir&s;t of the&s;e was the Situation and Fate of the ancient Military Republics. That of <HI>Corinth</HI> was de&s;troyed by the Fac|tion of the <HI>Praetor</HI> DIAEUS and his Party. The <HI>Athenian</HI> Commonwealth was again and again &s;haken and overturned by the Weight of oppo&s;ing Parties: in&s;omuch that the Hi&s;tory of this <HI>Republic</HI> may ju&s;tly be &s;tyled the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Faction.</HI> When de|generate Manners had de&s;troyed the Purity of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Con&s;titution and Laws of LYCURGUS, AGIS attempted to re&s;tore them, but was murdered in the generous Attempt by a Faction headed by the <HI>Ephori.</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI> Commonwealth, in its later Periods, was thrown into perpetual Con|vul&s;ions by ambitious and warlike Faction, and died at la&s;t of the Malady. And, to pa&s;s by many other Proofs that might be
<PB N="125" REF="120">
alledged, what Rivers of Blood have been &s;pilt in <HI>our own Country,</HI> among contend|ing Factions, while the Spirit of Arms and Honour remained among us?</P>
<P>BUT to give every Period of Manners it's due Character, it is confe&s;&s;ed that in the pre&s;ent <HI>effeminate</HI> tho' <HI>factious</HI> Times, we have no Danger of this kind to fear. For as our Manners are degenerated into tho&s;e of Women, &s;o are our Weapons of Offence.</P>
<P>BUT as this <HI>Home-Security</HI> ari&s;es only from the common <HI>Impotence;</HI> it is probable, that other Nations may &s;oon know of what Materials we are made; and therefore our Danger is likely to ari&s;e from <HI>without.</HI></P>
<P>LET us then examine what Effects this national Spirit of <HI>Di&s;union</HI> mu&s;t have upon
<PB N="126" REF="121">
us, as we &s;tand affected by any <HI>foreign Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>It weakens the <HI>Con&s;i&s;tency</HI> of all public Mea&s;ures: So that no great national Scheme of Thought can be carried into Action, if it's Accompli&s;hment demands any long. Continuity of Time.</P>
<P>IT weakens not only the <HI>Con&s;i&s;tency,</HI> but the <HI>Vigour</HI> and Expedition of all publick Mea&s;ures: So that while a divided People are contending about the Means of Security or Defence, a united Enemy may &s;ur|prize and invade them.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the apparent Con&s;equences of national Di&s;union: There is another not &s;o obvious, and therefore more likely to be fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="122">
WE have &s;een that in a Nation circum|&s;tanced like <HI>ours,</HI> the great Contention among tho&s;e of Quality and Fortune will probably lie in the Affair of <HI>Election In|tere&s;ts:</HI> That next to effeminate Plea|&s;ure and Gaming, this (for the &s;ame End as Gaming) will of Cour&s;e be the capital Pur&s;uit: that this Intere&s;t will naturally be regarded as a kind of <HI>Family-Fund,</HI> for the Provi&s;ion of the younger Branches: and that it's Force mu&s;t ari&s;e from this Principle, that in Ca&s;e the Head of the Family is not <HI>gratified</HI> in his lucrative De|mands, he and his Dependants will rai&s;e a <HI>Combu&s;tion</HI> in the State.</P>
<P>VIEWING the Affair, then, in this Light; we &s;hall &s;ee that, be&s;ides the general ill In|fluence of Faction, this Principle of Di&s;|union mu&s;t farther tend to weaken or de|&s;troy
<PB N="128" REF="123">
both the National <HI>Capacity</HI> and the national Spirit of <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
<P>FOR, in a Nation &s;o circum&s;tanced, thro' the Strength of this Principle, many high and important Po&s;ts, in every public and important Profe&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t of Cour&s;e be filled by Men, who in&s;tead of <HI>Ability</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> plead this <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> for their <HI>be&s;t Title.</HI></P>
<P>THUS in a Time when Science, Capa|city, Courage, Honour, Religion, Public Spirit, are rare; the remaining <HI>Few</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e Virtues, will often be &s;hut out from the&s;e Stations which they would fill with Honour; while every public and important Employ will abound with Men, who&s;e <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> are of the <HI>newe&s;t Fa&s;hion.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis acknowledged there are Exceptions to the Truth of this Remark. Nay, were

it nece&s;&s;ary, the Writer could gratify his Vanity, by ranking &s;ome of the&s;e Names in the Number of his Friends. But not|with&s;tanding the&s;e Exceptions, the general Ob&s;ervation will maintain it's Truth.</P>
<P>How indeed can it be otherwi&s;e, while the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this Principle has any Place in the Mind? Is not the Parliament-Intere&s;t of every powerful Family continu|ally rung in the Ears of it's Branches and Dependants? And does not this inevitably tend to relax and weaken the Application of the young Men of Quality and Fortune, and render every Man who has Reliance on this Principle, le&s;s qualified for tho&s;e Stations <HI>which</HI> BY THIS VERY PRINCIPLE he <HI>obtains?</HI> For why &s;hould a Youth of Family or Fa&s;hion (thus he argues with him&s;elf) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why &s;hould <HI>He</HI> &s;ubmit to the Drudgery of Schools, Colleges, Aca|demies,

<P>'Tis granted, indeed, that the Sons and Relations of Men of Quality and Fortune, have not only an equal, but even a prior Claim to all high Employments in the State, provided only, they are <HI>qualified to fill them honourably.</HI></P>
<P>WE may truly add to this, that in that Period of a State, when Capacity, Courage, and Honour, form its ruling Character; tho&s;e of high Quality and Degree, are ge|nerally of all others the mo&s;t capable, mo&s;t couragious, mo&s;t honourable.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, where Effeminacy and &s;elfi&s;h Vanity form the ruling Character of
<PB N="131" REF="126">
a People; there we may be no le&s;s certain, that tho&s;e of high Rank and Quality will in general be of all others mo&s;t vain, mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h, mo&s;t incapable, mo&s;t effeminate.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on is permanent, and the &s;ame in both Ca&s;es: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Becau&s;e in every Period of every State, "the Influence of the <HI>lead|ing People,</HI> &s;oon or late, will form it's <HI>leading Character."</HI></Q></P>

<P>IT may &s;eem, perhaps, at fir&s;t View, to have ari&s;en from the civil Wars that rent the Kingdom in the Time of HENRY <HI>the Great,</HI> to have been transfu&s;ed from thence into the gallant Reign of LOUIS, and thence heightened and delivered down to pre|&s;ent Times.</P>
<P>BUT tho' it received great Heighten|ings in the&s;e two Reigns, yet it pro|duced &s;ignal and peculiar Effects, before the fir&s;t of the&s;e Periods, In Proof of this, we need only alledge the famous Route called the <HI>Battle of Spurs,</HI> when HENRY <HI>the Eighth</HI> of <HI>England</HI> invaded <HI>France.</HI> On this Occa&s;ion, the Body of the <HI>French</HI> Army giving Way thro' &s;ome &s;udden Panic, the Officers kept their Ground, and rather

<HEAD>SECT. I. Of a general Mi&s;take on this Subject.</HEAD>
<P>THE publick Effects of our Man|ners and Principles here enume|rated, begin now to appear too manife&s;t in our public Mi&s;carriages, to be any longer derided. The Nation &s;tands agha&s;t

at it's own Misfortunes: But, like a Man &s;tarting &s;uddenly from Sleep, by the Noi&s;e of &s;ome approaching Ruin, knows neither whence it comes, nor how to avoid it.</P>
<P>IN Proof of this, we need only look into the late In&s;tructions from Con&s;tituents to Repre&s;entatives. The&s;e, we &s;ee, &s;eldom look farther than the immediate and incidental Occa&s;ion of each particular Mi&s;conduct: While the grand general Principles in which the&s;e Mi&s;conducts have been chiefly founded, are neither &s;een, nor &s;u&s;pected: Nay, an impartial Enquiry will probably convince us, that while they &s;trike at the Shoots and Branches, they feed the Root from whence the&s;e Mi&s;conducts have been originally derived.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. <HI>Of the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on</HI> Manners.</HEAD>
<P>BY Wealth is under&s;tood, every kind of u&s;eful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; or Money, which is it's Sign, and may be converted into it.</P>
<P>BY Commerce is under&s;tood the Ex|change of Wealth, for mutual Benefit.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="145">
THE Effects of Commerce on Manners have by mo&s;t Writers, I think, been con|&s;idered as <HI>uniform.</HI> Even the &s;age and amiable MONTESQUIEU &s;ays only, in ge|neral Terms, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Commerce poli&s;hes Manners, but corrupts Manners <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'E&s;prit des Loix, l. xx. c. 1.</NOTE>."</Q> Whereas, from a candid View of it's Na|ture and Effects, we &s;hall probably find, that in it's fir&s;t and middle Stages it is bene|ficent; in it's la&s;t, dangerous and fatal.</P>
<P>IF we view Commerce in its fir&s;t Stages, we &s;hall &s;ee, that it &s;upplies mutual Ne|ce&s;&s;ities, prevents mutual Wants, extends mutual Knowledge, eradicates mutual Pre|judice, and &s;preads mutual Humanity.</P>
<P>IF we view it in its middle and more advanced Period, we &s;hall &s;ee, it provides
<PB N="153" REF="146">
Conveniencies, increa&s;eth Numbers, coins Money, gives Birth to Arts and Science, creates equal Laws, diffu&s;es general Plenty and general Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IF we view it in it's third and highe&s;t Stage, we &s;hall &s;ee it change it's Nature and Effects. It brings in Superfluity and va&s;t Wealth; begets Avarice, gro&s;s Luxury, or effeminate Refinement among the higher Ranks, together with general Lo&s;s of Principle.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the two fir&s;t Stages of Commerce, I &s;hall have no Di&s;pute with the pre&s;ent Times: It's Benefits are gene|rally acknowledged. The dangerous Ef|fects of it's Exorbitance or Exce&s;s have not yet been &s;ufficiently developed.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="147">
THAT Commerce in it's Exce&s;s brings a general Superfluity of Goods, that this general Superfluity &s;ettles in particular Hands into va&s;t Wealth, will be readily acknowledged.</P>
<P>THE next Step is, to con&s;ider how va&s;t Wealth naturally produces Avarice, Lux|ury, or Effeminacy, according to the Ge|nius or Circum&s;tances of the People among whom it comes.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY, in it's fir&s;t Stages, is <HI>fru|gal,</HI> not <HI>ungenerous:</HI> It's End being that of Self-Pre&s;ervation and moderate Enjoy|ment, it's little Superfluities are often em|ployed in Acts of Genero&s;ity and Bene|ficence. But the daily Increa&s;e of Wealth by Indu&s;try, naturally increa&s;es the <HI>Love</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="148">
of Wealth. The Pa&s;&s;ion for Money, be|ing founded, not in Sen&s;e, but Imagination, admits of no Satiety, like tho&s;e which are called the natural Pa&s;&s;ions. Thus the Habit of &s;aving Money, beyond every other Habit, gathers Strength by continued Gratification. The Attention of the whole Man is immediately turned upon it; and every other Pur&s;uit held light when com|pared with the Increa&s;e of Wealth. Hence, the natural Character of the Trader, when his final Pro&s;pect is the Acqui&s;ition of Wealth, is that of <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>Avarice.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is true, in this Re&s;pect, of <HI>trad|ing Men,</HI> is true of <HI>trading Nations.</HI> If their Commerce be that of Oeconomy in the Extreme, if the la&s;t Object of their Pur&s;uit be Wealth for it's own Sake, if the Leaders of &s;uch a People be <HI>commercial,</HI> the Cha|racter
<PB N="156" REF="149">
of that People, and it's Leaders, will be found in <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>Avarice.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if a trading Nation hath a large <HI>Territory,</HI> &s;ufficient to create a <HI>Landed In|tere&s;t,</HI> Commerce will produce very diffe|rent Effects.</P>
<P>FOR as it multiplies Inhabitants, and brings in Wealth, it naturally increa&s;es the Value of landed E&s;tates. Barren Grounds are cultivated, and cultivated Spots are made more fertile. Hence a va&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion of Income to the Nobility and Gentry.</P>
<P>THESE Ranks of Men being not bred up to Habits of Indu&s;try; on the con|trary, their increa&s;ed Rents coming in un&s;ought for, and their Time being often a Load upon them, thro' want of Capacity and Employment, the Habit of <HI>Indulgence</HI> comes on, and grows of Cour&s;e. Addi|tional
<PB N="157" REF="150">
Wealth gives the Power to gratify every De&s;ire that ri&s;es, Lei&s;ure improves the&s;e De&s;ires into Habits; thus Money is at length con&s;idered as no more than the Means of Gratification; and hence the genuine Character of a rich Nobility or Gentry, is that of Expence and Luxury.</P>
<P>BUT the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ays of Luxury, like tho&s;e of every other Art, are coar&s;e and rude: The natural Character of Luxury, therefore, is to refine by Degrees: E&s;pe|cially, when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Commerce, it ad|vances apace into Refinement. For Com|merce &s;earches every Shore and Climate for it's Supplies; and Art is &s;tudious, be|cau&s;e rewarded, in arranging and applying the&s;e Materials to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and delicate U&s;e. Thus every coar&s;er Mode of Plea&s;ure is by Degrees de&s;pi&s;ed; new Habits of higher Indulgence come on:
<PB N="158" REF="151">
gro&s;s Luxury is bani&s;hed, and Effeminacy takes it's Place.</P>
<P>BUT Luxury, in this <HI>la&s;t</HI> Period, being exhau&s;ted in it's Cour&s;e; and turned, for want of new Objects of Indulgence, into Debility and Languor, would expire or &s;leep, were it not awakened by another Pa&s;&s;ion, which again calls it into Action. Nothing is &s;o natural to effeminate Minds, as <HI>Vanity.</HI> This rouzes the lux|urious and debilitated Soul; and the Arts of plea&s;urable Enjoyment are now pu&s;hed to their highe&s;t Degree, by the Spirit of delicate Emulation.</P>
<P>THUS the whole Attention of the Mind is centred on <HI>Brillancy</HI> and <HI>Indulgence:</HI> Money, tho' de&s;pi&s;ed as an <HI>End,</HI> is greedily &s;ought as a <HI>Means:</HI> And <HI>Self,</HI> under a dif|ferent
<PB N="159" REF="152">
Appearance from the trading Spirit, takes equal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Soul.</P>
<P>THUS as the Character of a State altoge|ther commercial in the highe&s;t Degree, is that of Indu&s;try and Avarice; &s;o, in a Nation of extended Territory, where Com|merce is in it's highe&s;t Period, while it's trading Members retain their Habits of Indu&s;try and Avarice, the natural Charac|ter of it's landed Ranks, it's Nobility and Gentry, is that of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a vain, luxurious, and &s;elfi&s;h Effeminacy."</Q></P>
<P>WE &s;peak here of the &s;imple and proper Effects of Trade and Wealth, uncontrouled by oppo&s;ite Manners or Principles; which, it is to be ob&s;erved, never exi&s;ted probably, at lea&s;t in the mixed State, in their full Ex|tent: Individuals there are, and will be, in almo&s;t every State and Period, who are
<PB N="160" REF="153">
influenced by di&s;&s;imilar Manners or Prin|ciples: There are Traders who are gene|rous; Nobles and Gentry who&s;e ultimate Pa&s;&s;ion is for Gold: But &s;uch Exceptions affect not the general Principle: And tho' the&s;e incidental Mixtures <HI>Weaken</HI> the diffe|rent Colours of different Ranks or States, yet &s;till the different Colours remain in their Nature di&s;tinct and invariable.</P>
<P>'TIS probable, the Reader will have di&s;|covered, that this Rea&s;oning is &s;trengthened by, or rather built upon, the Examples of two neighbour Nation; one wholly com|mercial, that of <HI>Holland:</HI> The other a mixed State, compounded of a commer|cial and landed Intere&s;t; I mean <HI>our own.</HI> And to &s;ay the Truth; no two Nations perhaps ever exi&s;ted, which approached &s;o near to the full and proper Effects of the Cau&s;es here alledged.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="154">
IT will appear immediately why the Genius of the Republic of <HI>Holland</HI> is here analy&s;ed into its fir&s;t Principles; which are &s;imply, tho&s;e of Indu&s;try and the Love of Gain.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, we may ju&s;tly conclude from this Argument, that the exorbitant Trade and Wealth of <HI>England</HI> &s;ufficiently account for it's pre&s;ent <HI>Effemi|nacy.</HI></P>

<P>SUCH therefore are the ruling Manners which may naturally be expected in a Na|tion thus circum&s;tanced, unle&s;s they be
<PB N="162" REF="155">
counteracted by oppo&s;ite Principles: 'Tis now Time to con&s;ider the natural Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth, on all tho&s;e &s;alutary Principles by which the&s;e effeminate Manners can mo&s;t effectually be controuled.</P>
<P>LET us &s;till carry the two characteri&s;tic States of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> in our Eye.</P>
<P>WHETHER, then, we view the com|mercial State, where the Love of Money rules; or the mixed State, where vain Effeminacy predominates; we &s;hall find both the&s;e national Characters have but a bad A&s;pect and Influence on every Kind of Principle. Let us fir&s;t con&s;ider that of Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="156">
AVARICE &s;eems not, in it's own Nature, prone to de&s;troy <HI>&s;peculative</HI> religious Be|lief; but effectually to extingui&s;h <HI>active</HI> religious Principle.</P>
<P>IT tends not to de&s;troy &s;peculative Be|lief, becau&s;e this Effect mu&s;t be a Work of Application, Time, and Labour: Now the Labour of Avarice is naturally bent on it's main Object, <HI>Money;</HI> therefore, to wa&s;te this Labour on the Propagation of the unprofitable and fruitle&s;s Doctrines of Irreligion, mu&s;t ever be contrary to it's ruling Character.</P>
<P>BUT Avarice naturally tends to the De|&s;truction of active religious Principles; be|cau&s;e this is chiefly a Matter of <HI>habitual Impre&s;&s;ion;</HI> and therefore, in order to ac|compli&s;h it's De&s;truction, nothing more is
<PB N="164" REF="157">
nece&s;&s;ary than to <HI>forget.</HI> Now this re|quires no po&s;itive Act or Labour of the Mind, but is the natural Re&s;ult from an attentive Pur&s;uit of the favourite Object, <HI>Money.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE, in a mere commercial State, actuated by the Love of Gain, Religion is not railed at or di&s;puted again&s;t, but only <HI>neglected</HI> and <HI>forgot.</HI> And thus, the <HI>genuine Trader,</HI> who never que&s;tioned the Articles of his national Faith at home, &s;cruples not to for&s;wear <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and tread upon the Cro&s;s in <HI>Japan,</HI> and returns the &s;ame good <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> as he went.</P>
<P>BUT in the mixed State, where national Effeminacy forms the <HI>primary,</HI> and Avarice only the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> Character, the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on religious Principle, will be widely different.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="158">
LORD <HI>VERULAM</HI> hath &s;omewhere ob&s;erved, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Times of Athei&s;m are civil Times."</Q>He had been much nearer the Truth, had he affirmed, that  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Civil Times are Times of Athei&s;m."</Q> He mi&s;took the Cau&s;e for the Effect.</P>
<P>THIS Effect of national Luxury and Re|finement, in producing national Irreligion, is not difficult to account for. In &s;ome Periods of a State, Opinions controul Man|ners; but in mo&s;t Periods, Manners con|troul'Opinions. Where the ruling Man|ners coincide with the common Good, as in the middle Periods of a State, there we commonly find that a rational and bene|ficent Sy&s;tem of Religion prevails: This comes to pa&s;s, becau&s;e the Principles of the received Religion contradict not the ruling Manners.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="159">
BUT in the State and Period of Luxury or Refinement, active religious Principle is lo&s;t thro' the attentive Pur&s;uit of <HI>Plea&s;ure;</HI> as in the commercial State, it is lo&s;t thro' the attentive Pur&s;uit of <HI>Gain.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>&s;peculative</HI> Belief, in this Period, mu&s;t naturally be lo&s;t along with <HI>practical;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Lei&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Literature</HI> having opened the Field of <HI>Di&s;putation,</HI> Vice as well as Virtue will of cour&s;e arm her&s;elf with every Weapon of Pre&s;ervation and Offence. Luxury therefore will generally li&s;t under the Banner of Irreligion; becau&s;e Religion condemns her Manners; Irreli|gion &s;uffers, or approves them.</P>
<P>To confirm the Truth of this Rea&s;oning, we need only ob&s;erve, that in the Period of refined Luxury, <HI>few</HI> but they who are in|volved
<PB N="167" REF="160">
in the <HI>Vices,</HI> are involved in the <HI>Irreligion</HI> of the Times.</P>
<P>ONE Exception, however, mu&s;t be made, with Regard to the <HI>Writers</HI> again&s;t Religion. For <HI>the&s;e,</HI> though they <HI>promote,</HI> yet are not often <HI>involved</HI> in the common Degeneracy. This Fact hath been re|garded as unaccountable: that <HI>&s;ober</HI> Men of Morals apparently <HI>unblameable,</HI> &s;hould madly unhinge the great Principle of Reli|gion and Society, without any vi&s;ible Mo|tive or Advantage. But by looking a little far|ther into human Nature, we &s;hall ea&s;ily re&s;olve this &s;eeming Paradox. The&s;e Writers are generally Men of Speculation and Indu&s;|try; and therefore though they give them|&s;elves up to the Dictates of their ruling Pa&s;&s;i|on, yet that ruling Pa&s;&s;ion commonly leads to the Tract of <HI>ab&s;temious</HI> Manners. That De&s;ire of <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> and <HI>Superiority,</HI> &s;o na|tural
<PB N="168" REF="161">
to Man, breaks out in a thou&s;and va|rious and fanta&s;tic Shapes, and in each of the&s;e, according as it is directed, becomes a Virtue or a Vice. In Times of Luxury and Di&s;&s;ipation therefore, when every Tenet of Irreligion is greedily embraced, what Road to <HI>pre&s;ent Applau&s;e</HI> can lie &s;o open and &s;ecure, as that of di&s;gracing religious Belief? E&s;pe|cially if the Writer help forward the Vices of the Times, by <HI>relaxing Morals,</HI> as well as <HI>de&s;troying Principle.</HI> Such a Writer can have little el&s;e to do, but to new model the Para|doxes of ancient <HI>Sceptici&s;m,</HI> in order to <HI>figure it</HI> in the World, and be regarded by the Smat|terers in Literature and Adepts in Folly, as a Prodigy of Parts and Learning. Thus his <HI>Vanity</HI> becomes deeply criminal, and is ex|ecrated by the Wi&s;e and Good, becau&s;e it is gratified at the Expence of his Country's Wel|fare. But the <HI>Con&s;olation</HI> which degenerate Manners receive from his fatal Tenets, is
<PB N="169" REF="162">
repaid by eager <HI>Prai&s;e:</HI> And <HI>Vice</HI> impati|ently drinks in and <HI>applauds</HI> his hoar&s;e and boding Voice, while like a <HI>Raven,</HI> he &s;its croaking univer&s;al Death, De&s;pair, and Annihilation to the human Kind.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of the Effects of exorbitant Trade and Wealth on the Principle of Honour.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mixed State, where Luxury and Effeminacy form the ruling Character of a People, the Exce&s;s of Trade and Wealth naturally tends to weaken or de&s;troy the Principle of <HI>Honour,</HI> by fixing the De&s;ire of Applau&s;e, and the Fear of Shame, on im|proper and ridiculous Objects. In&s;tead of the Good of others, or the Happine&s;s of

<P>BUT in the pure commercial State, where the Love of Gain predominates among the higher Ranks, the De&s;ire of Applau&s;e and Fear of Shame are not <HI>perverted,</HI> but <HI>ex|tingui&s;hed.</HI> The Lu&s;t of Gold &s;wallows up every other Pa&s;&s;ion: and a Nation of this Character can without Emotion &s;tand the Laughter and Contempt of <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;ay with the Mi&s;er,</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Farther Remarks on this Subject.</HEAD>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of the&s;e Remarks, &s;ome farther Di&s;tinctions will ari&s;e.</P>
<P>THUS, the religious Principle will <HI>&s;eem</HI> to exi&s;t in the commercial State, where Avarice forms the national Character; while in the mixed State where Luxury and Effe|minacy predominate, it is evidently de&s;troy|ed. The Rea&s;on is, that in the fir&s;t, al|though active Principle is lo&s;t, &s;peculative Belief is not controverted: Whereas, in the latter, not only active Principle is lo&s;t, but Religion it&s;elf (if &s;uch a State be free) is publickly in&s;ulted and derided. Thus in <HI>Holland,</HI> Religion <HI>&s;eems</HI> yet to exi&s;t; while in <HI>England</HI> it is evidently de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="169">
ON the contrary, the Principle of Ho|nour will &s;eem to exi&s;t in the mixed State, where luxurious Effeminacy forms the pri|mary Character of the Nation; while in the commercial State, where Avarice pre|dominates, the Principle is evidently no more. The Rea&s;on is, that in the for|mer, the Love of Applau&s;e and Fear of Shame are not wholly de&s;troyed, but per|verted, and turned upon unworthy Objects; while in the latter, the Pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf is to|tally extingui&s;hed. Thus the faint Appear|ance of Honour yet remains in <HI>England,</HI> while in <HI>Holland</HI> it is manife&s;tly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>BUT as modern <HI>Dutch</HI> Religion, and modern <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Honour, &s;eem no more than the Gho&s;ts of departed Principles, &s;o they have preci&s;ely tho&s;e Effects, which
<PB N="177" REF="170">
may rea&s;onably be expected from &s;uch &s;hadowy Non-Entities.</P>
<P>AGAIN: The Colours or Characters of Indu&s;try and Avarice will naturally be <HI>&s;trong</HI> in the commercial State: becau&s;e, being almo&s;t wholly unmixed with Man|ners of a di&s;&s;imilar Nature, the ruling Ge|nius of the State is left uncontrouled, to its proper Operations and Effects.</P>
<P>BUT in the mixed State, where Indu|&s;try and Love of Gain form the Character of the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> Ranks; Di&s;&s;ipation and Effeminacy, of the <HI>higher;</HI> there the two &s;eparate Characters, by the Force of inci|dental Coalition and Example, will always influence each other in a certain Degree. Some ambitious Traders will a&s;pire to lux|urious Effeminacy: Some, of the higher Orders, will de&s;cend to Indu&s;try and Mer|chandi&s;e.
<PB N="178" REF="171">
Thus each Rank mu&s;t be tinc|tured with a Colour different from its own; and hence, the general Colour or Cha|racter of each of the&s;e Ranks, will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure be controuled and <HI>weak|ened.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Circum&s;tance is favourable to the mixed State, beyond that which is purely commercial; as it checks in a certain De|gree the Virulence of the Exce&s;s; and pro|duceth a national Character in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure approaching that of more moderate Trade and Wealth.</P>
<P>HENCE too it follows, that a State purely commerical, when once arrived at the Pe|riod of exorbitant Wealth, will naturally degenerate <HI>fa&s;ter</HI> than that which is com|pounded of Commerce and Luxury. For whatever Cau&s;es check the ruling Man|ners
<PB N="179" REF="172">
in their <HI>Degree,</HI> will check them in their <HI>Con&s;equences.</HI></P>
<P>BUT beyond this, there is another Rea|&s;on, why the State purely commercial will degenerate fa&s;ter than the mixed State. In the commercial State, the ruling Manners go Hand in Hand with the Exorbitance of Wealth; becau&s;e the Love of Gain, which forms the leading Character, being like|wi&s;e the leading Motive, mu&s;t be even prior to this Exorbitance in the Order of our Ideas; and therefore, in its Effects, mu&s;t be at lea&s;t contemporary.</P>
<P>BUT in the mixed State, there will al|ways be a &s;hort Period between the nati|onal Exorbitance of Wealth, and the nati|onal Increa&s;e of luxurious Effeminacy: be|cau&s;e Manners, once got into a certain Track, are not at once thrown out of it.
<PB N="180" REF="173">
There mu&s;t be a &s;hort Period, before the leading Parts of the Nation can <HI>feel</HI> their Increa&s;e of Wealth; and after this, ano|ther Period, before new and more refined Modes of Plea&s;ure can be invented.</P>
<P>HENCE a neighbouring Republic &s;eems to have well nigh filled up the Mea&s;ure of its Iniquities; while <HI>ours,</HI> as yet, are only ri&s;ing towards the <HI>Brim.</HI></P>
<P>LASTLY; though the ruling Manners of &s;uch a mixed State are luxurious and effeminate, yet its public Mea&s;ures will be <HI>commercial.</HI> Fir&s;t, becau&s;e Commerce is the Hand-Maid of <HI>Wealth,</HI> and therefore of <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI> Secondly, becau&s;e the Idea of national Strength as well Happine&s;s be|ing degenerated into that of Wealth and external Good, Commerce will above all Things be naturally encouraged, becau&s;e it is the Means of procuring them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. A Review of the Argument.</HEAD>
<P>THUS our pre&s;ent exorbitant Degree of Trade and Wealth, in a mixed State like that of <HI>England,</HI> naturally tends to produce luxurious and effeminate Manners in the higher Ranks, together with a general De|fect of <HI>Principle.</HI> And as the internal Strength of a Nation will always depend chiefly on the Manners and Principles of it's leading Members, &s;o the&s;e effeminate Manners and this Defect of Principle ope|rate powerfully, and fatally, on the na|tional Conduct and Affairs. They have pro|duced a general Incapacity, have weaken|ed the national Spirit of Defence, have heightened the national Di&s;union: And this national Di&s;union, be&s;ides it's proper and immediate Effects, being founded in
<PB N="182" REF="175">
Avarice for the Ends of Di&s;&s;ipation, hath again weakened the &s;mall Remainder of publick Capacity and Defence; and thus &s;eems to have fitted us for a Prey to the In&s;ults and Inva&s;ions of our mo&s;t powerful Enemy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VIII. An Objection con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>THO' this E&s;timate may appear <HI>ju&s;t</HI> to tho&s;e who take an enlarged View of Things in their Principles and Con&s;equences; yet I am not ignorant of certain Maxims, ge|nerally approved, and hardly even di&s;puted among modern Politicians, which if true, would weaken or overturn the&s;e accumu|lated Proofs.</P>
<P>THE capital Maxim, which &s;eems to in|clude the re&s;t, is this; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That va&s;t Trade
<PB N="183" REF="176">
and Wealth, above all things make a Nation powerful and invincible, as they increa&s;e it's Numbers, enable it to pay it's Fleets and Armies, provide conti|nual Supplies for War; and thus, in the End, tire out and defeat every Enemy, who&s;e Wealth and Commerce are in|ferior."</Q></P>
<P>THE Examination of this Maxim will throw many &s;trong collateral Lights upon our main Subject.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t it affirms, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Trade and Wealth make a Nation &s;trong, becau&s;e they make it populous."</Q> This indeed is true of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Periods of Trade and Wealth: That it is true of the <HI>third</HI> or <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Period, of which <HI>England</HI> is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, may very rea&s;onably be que&s;ti|oned. In the fir&s;t Period, Indu&s;try is chiefly
<PB N="184" REF="177">
employed in cultivating the Lands, in en|crea&s;ing, manufacturing, and exchanging the Produce of the Mother Country. The&s;e Branches of Trade call for va&s;t additional Numbers of Hands; and hence an Increa&s;e of Numbers naturally ari&s;eth.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Effect takes Place in the &s;econd Period of Trade; &s;o far as home Productions are <HI>exchanged</HI> for foreign ones. This Stage of Commerce brings on a fre&s;h Demand of Artificers of new and various Kinds, produces and In|crea&s;e of Labour, and therefore of Inha|bitants.</P>
<P>BUT in the third or highe&s;t Period of Trade, of which <HI>England</HI> is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, there are very exten&s;ive Branches of Com|merce, which bring no new Acce&s;&s;ion of Numbers to the Commonwealth. I mean,
<PB N="185" REF="178">
all tho&s;e Branches of Commerce, where <HI>Money</HI> is &s;ent and exchanged for <HI>foreign</HI> Goods. This Species of Trade occa&s;ions little Increa&s;e of <HI>Labour,</HI> and therefore le&s;s of <HI>Numbers;</HI> except only of tho&s;e few who navigate the Ve&s;&s;els thus employed, to their re&s;pective Ports. And as this kind of Trade will always grow and predominate, in proportion as a Nation becomes more luxurious and effeminate, &s;o for this Rea|&s;on the highe&s;t Stage of Trade is not natu|rally attended with the highe&s;t Increa&s;e of Labour, nor con&s;equently of <HI>Numbers,</HI> as is commonly imagined. Be&s;ides this, in the refined Period, additional Art and Ex|perience in Labour prevent, in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure, the Increa&s;e of Numbers. By the Invention of Machines, an equal Degree both of Tillage and Trade is carried on by fewer Hands, than in the &s;impler Periods; and therefore the Increa&s;e of Numbers is

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="185" REF="180">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="186" REF="181">
by no means proportional to the Increa&s;e of Commerce and Wealth.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e are far from being the only Con&s;iderations worth our Notice on this Subject. For when we &s;peak of any Stage of Trade, we mu&s;t in Rea&s;on take in <HI>every</HI> Circum&s;tance which naturally attends it. There are other Cau&s;es, therefore, why Numbers increa&s;e not, but rather naturally <HI>dimini&s;h,</HI> in the highe&s;t Period of Trade and Wealth.</P>
<P>FOR <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the Vanity and Effeminacy which this exorbitant Pitch of Wealth brings on, le&s;&s;ens the De&s;ire of Mar|riage.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> the Intemperance and Di&s;ea&s;e which this Period of Trade naturally pro|duceth among the <HI>lower Ranks</HI> in great
<PB N="187" REF="182">
Cities, bring on in &s;ome Degree an Im|potence of Propagation.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This Debility is always attended with a Shortne&s;s of Life, both in the Pa|rents and the Offspring; and therefore a &s;till farther Diminution of Numbers fol|lows on the whole.</P>
<P>MATTER of Fact confirms the&s;e Rea|&s;onings; and lies open to every Man's Ob|&s;ervation. Since the fir&s;t Increa&s;e of Til|lage and Home-manufactures, the Increa&s;e of Inhabitants hath been great in <HI>England:</HI> Since the va&s;t Increa&s;e of foreign Com|merce, the Increa&s;e of Numbers is hardly perceivable. Nay, there is great Rea&s;on to believe, that upon the whole, the Nation is le&s;s populous than it was fifty Years ago, tho' it's Trade perhaps is doubled. Some trading Towns indeed are better
<PB N="188" REF="183">
peopled, but others are thinned by the Flux of Commerce. The Metropolis &s;eems to augment in its Dimen&s;ions: But it appears, by the be&s;t Calculations, that it's Numbers are dimini&s;hed; And as to the Villages thro' <HI>England,</HI> there is great Rea&s;on to believe, they are in general at a Stand, and many of them thinner of Inhabitants than in the Beginning of this Century. 'Tis hard to obtain Cer|tainty in this Particular, without a ge|neral Examination and Compari&s;on. But it appears by the Regi&s;ters of &s;ome <HI>Coun|try</HI> Pari&s;hes, which I have looked into, that from the Year 1550 to 1710, the Number of Inhabitants increa&s;ed gra|dually; the two Extremes being to each other, as 57 to 72; and that from 1710 to the pre&s;ent Time, the Number has been at a Stand, if not rather dimi|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="184">
BUT &s;uppo&s;e, what there is no Rea&s;on to believe, that our pre&s;ent Exce&s;s of Trade and Overflow of Wealth have in &s;ome Degree increa&s;ed our <HI>Numbers,</HI> yet it will probably appear, that they have as much, at lea&s;t, impaired our <HI>bodily Strength.</HI> For as <HI>Temperance</HI> is the rul|ing Character of the middle Stage of Commerce, &s;o is <HI>Intemperance</HI> of the highe&s;t. Hence, Health and Strength prevail in the fir&s;t; Di&s;ea&s;e and Debility in the latter. This is univer&s;ally confirmed by Fact: Villages abounding with Health; commercial Cities with Di&s;ea&s;e. So that an Army taken from the Villages, with equal Commanders, Arms, and Di&s;cipline, would drive the &s;ame Number of debili|tated Gin-drinkers, like a Flock of Gee&s;e before them.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="185">
THE Author of the <HI>Fable of the Bees</HI> made his Boa&s;t, that the Wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lature had, upon his Plan, adopted the Encouragement of this pernicious Li|quid: But the &s;ame Wi&s;dom hath upon Trial been obliged to <HI>di&s;courage</HI> the U&s;e of this malignant Spirit; as they found that it ruined the Health, and &s;hortened the Lives, of half the lower Ranks in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>AND all good Men hope, that the Time will come, when this infernal Potion will be laid under &s;uch Di&s;couragements, as may amount to a general Prohibition. The Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Reformation grows greater every Day, not only in <HI>London,</HI> but throughout the Kingdom. For in &s;ome Villages in <HI>England</HI> there is now a greater Quantity of Gin con&s;umed than of Ale.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="186">
BUT to quit the&s;e inferior Con&s;idera|tions, tho' they all unite in confirming the Theory here advanced; the Weight of the Reply lies indeed in another Circum&s;tance: For altho' we &s;hould admit (what is not true) that our pre&s;ent Exorbitance of Trade and Wealth increa&s;ed our Numbers and bodily Force, yet as the real and e&s;&s;en|tial Strength of a Nation con&s;i&s;ts in the Manners and Principles of it's <HI>leading Part;</HI> and as our pre&s;ent Exce&s;s of Trade and Wealth hath produced &s;uch fatal Effects on the&s;e Manners and Principles; no In|crea&s;e of Numbers in the inferior Ranks can po&s;&s;ibly make amends for this internal and capital Defect. Such a Nation can, at be&s;t, only re&s;emble a large <HI>Body,</HI> actuated (yet hardly actuated) by an incapable, a vain, a da&s;tardly, and effeminate <HI>Soul.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="187">
BUT the Maxim we are engaged to ob|viate, alledges farther, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This exor|bitant Increa&s;e of Trade and Wealth enables a Nation to pay it's Fleets and Armies, and afford continual Sup|plies for War."</Q> Yet, even this Part of the Maxim, in it's modern Acceptation, is far beyond the Truth.</P>
<P>FOR under the pre&s;ent Stage of Trade, the Increa&s;e of Wealth is by no means equally or proportionally diffu&s;ed: The Trader reaps the main Profit: after him, the Landlord, in a lower Degree: But the common Artificer, and &s;till more the common Labourer, gain little by the exorbitant Advance of Trade: It is true, their Wages are increa&s;ed; but &s;o are the Prices of Provi&s;ions too: and therefore they are no richer than before.
<PB N="193" REF="188">
Now Taxes and public Supplies are rai&s;ed upon the Con&s;umer: and as it appears from hence, that only a few of the Con|&s;umers are made richer by the Exorbitance of Trade, it follows, that not the Nation in general, but a &s;elect Number of Indi|viduals only, are made more capable of contributing to tho&s;e Supplies, which are levied without Di&s;tinction on the <HI>whole.</HI> Would they who reap the plenteous Harve&s;t of foreign Trade, generou&s;ly allot their proportional and extraordinary Gains to the Service of the Public, we &s;hould then indeed be furni&s;hed with a <HI>new</HI> Argument in Fa|vour of Commerce in it's highe&s;t Pitch.</P>
<P>FARTHER: As the labouring Ranks are little or nothing enriched by the exorbitant Degree of Trade, &s;o it often happens that even the higher Ranks, and the Nation in general, are not <HI>more,</HI> nay perhaps <HI>le&s;s</HI> en|abled
<PB N="194" REF="189">
to contribute to the public Supplies, than when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Wealth in a more moderate Degree. For we have &s;een, in the Progre&s;s of this E&s;timate, that the na|tural Effect of an Increa&s;e of Wealth, is an Increa&s;e of Luxury, Vanity, and Ex|pence; which, if it outrun the Increa&s;e of Wealth, as in it's Nature it tends to do, in&s;tead of Riches will bring on public Po|verty. For the Ability or Wealth of a People, con&s;idered in their Capacity for rai&s;ing Supplies, con&s;i&s;ts not in the Large|ne&s;s of their Income, but in the Proportion of their Expences to their Income: It con&s;i&s;ts not in <Q REND="inline">"what they <HI>have,"</HI></Q> but <Q REND="inline">"what they can <HI>Spare?"</HI></Q> Hence it ap|pears, that a Nation may be at once very <HI>rich,</HI> and very <HI>poor;</HI> rich in Income, but poor thro' Extravagance. And as national Extravagance is the natural Effect of an Overflow of Wealth, &s;o national Indigence
<PB N="195" REF="190">
is it's mo&s;t natural and final Con&s;equence. How far this is our pre&s;ent Situation, can hardly be nece&s;&s;ary to affirm.</P>
<P>To this Argument it may po&s;&s;ibly be objected, that if great Wealth is but among us, new Impo&s;ts will naturally <HI>force</HI> it into Circulation: That the more the Artificers and Labourers are taxed, the more their Wages will increa&s;e, and con&s;equently their Ability to bear the in|crea&s;ing Taxes: And that as to the higher Ranks, exorbitant Wealth <HI>enables</HI> them &s;till better to endure additional Impo&s;ts, becau&s;e the&s;e deprive the Great of nothing but the Superfluities of Vanity and Luxury.</P>
<P>To this it is replied, that in Ca&s;e of additional Taxes, tho' the Poor <HI>mu&s;t</HI> indeed increa&s;e their Wages in order to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, yet this Increa&s;e never takes Place, till
<PB N="196" REF="191">
they are compelled by the la&s;t <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Want:</HI> The natural Con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be Murmurs, Sedition, and Tumults. With Regard to the higher Ranks, a parallel Reply may &s;uffice: For in the refined Period, when Manners and Principles are lo&s;t, the Luxuries of Life become <HI>Nece&s;&s;aries</HI> among the Great; and therefore will be as ob&s;tinately adhered to, and quitted with the &s;ame Reluctance, as Food and Cloathing by the <HI>Poor.</HI> The Con&s;equence therefore mu&s;t be the &s;ame; a general Di&s;content and Di&s;affection to the Government, among the higher Ranks of Life.</P>
<P>IS not all this confirmed by evident Facts; There is at pre&s;ent in this Nation a Ma&s;s of Wealth at lea&s;t twelve Times more than the publick Debt: Yet we are reduced to the &s;ad Nece&s;&s;ity of plunging
<PB N="197" REF="192">
deeper every Day. What is the Rea&s;on? No Mini&s;try dares to provoke and exa&s;perate a luxurious and &s;elfi&s;h Nation, by demand|ing &s;uch Sums, as every one has the <HI>Power</HI> had he but the <HI>Will,</HI> to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>BUT beyond all this, will any Man of Sen&s;e a&s;&s;ert, that the Circum&s;tance of <HI>pay|ing</HI> an Army or a Fleet, is the one thing that will decide a War? 'Tis true, indeed, Pro|vi&s;ions, Arms, Ammunition are nece&s;&s;ary; and therefore <HI>Wealth,</HI> becau&s;e it procures them.

To &s;hew this, two In&s;tances, out of many may &s;uffice.

<P>THESE &s;hallow Politicians, therefore, might well be put in Mind of the Maxim of a warlike Prince, when his Mini&s;ters

<HEAD>SECT. IX. Another Objection con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH then are the natural Effects of ex|orbitant Trade and Wealth, unle&s;s coun|teracted by oppo&s;ite Manners or Principles. The Hi&s;tory of our own Nation would confirm the&s;e Truths in a mo&s;t &s;triking and particular Manner, were it within the propo&s;ed Limits of this E&s;timate, to enter &s;o large a Field of Enquiry. We &s;hould there &s;ee, that Manners and Principles
<PB N="203" REF="198">
have always prevailed, and baffled the mo&s;t &s;anguine Attempts of Wealth, when &s;et in Competition with them. This Sy&s;tem would be found &s;upported by a va&s;t Va|riety of Events, from the Reign of <HI>Eliza|beth</HI> to the pre&s;ent Times. But this might perhaps be regarded as a Re&s;earch rather curious than nece&s;&s;ary; &s;ince a &s;ingle Re|flection on the pre&s;ent State of the King|dom may &s;eem to &s;tand in the Place of a thou&s;and Proofs.</P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent, therefore, we &s;hall not touch on this Enquiry; but rather proceed to remove another Objection, which may &s;eem to overturn the Theory here propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>FOR it is urged, that <HI>France</HI> is an Ex|ception to the Truth of the&s;e Remarks: ina&s;much as, in the mid&s;t of a large and exten&s;ive Commerce, which brings in a
<PB N="204" REF="199">
va&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion of Wealth, &s;he &s;tills retains her Principles and Power.</P>
<P>THE Fact objected is true: but the Con&s;equence follows not; becau&s;e the Trade of <HI>France</HI> is limited and controuled by &s;uch Accidents, as prevent it's mo&s;t dangerous and ruinous Effects on Govern|ment</P>
<P>THE <HI>Poverty</HI> of its <HI>Noble&s;&s;e</HI> or leading Ranks, who are often po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ound|ing Titles without any Realities annexed, as it prevents them from reaping that In|crea&s;e of Wealth which naturally ari&s;eth to a rich Landed Gentry from an Increa&s;e of Commerce, &s;o it naturally drives them to the Profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Arms,</HI> as the nece&s;&s;ary Means of Support: This &s;trengthens and &s;upports their Monarchy; which, finding it's Advantage from this Di&s;po&s;ition to
<PB N="205" REF="200">
Arms, naturally gratifies this military Spi|rit in it's <HI>Noble&s;&s;e,</HI> and gives it Exerci&s;e and Encouragement by frequent Wars.</P>
<P>HENCE the national Spirit of the <HI>French Noble&s;&s;e</HI> hath long been military, in the highe&s;t Degree.</P>
<P>WITH Regard to Commerce, it's Growth in <HI>France</HI> hath been but late: Meeting therefore with this e&s;tabli&s;hed Spirit of Arms in the leading Ranks, it hath not as yet been able to controul it. Commerce indeed is encouraged; but &s;o encouraged, as not to de&s;troy the leading Principle of their Monarchy. To this End, the Ranks of the Kingdom are kept e&s;&s;entially di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; and while the People are allured to Trade by every Kind of Motive, the <HI>Noble&s;&s;e</HI> or Gentry are, in Honour, prohi|bited from Commerce. It was indeed
<PB N="206" REF="201">
formerly propo&s;ed in <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>Noble&s;&s;e</HI> &s;hould be drawn down to Trade: But, whether thro' deep and con&s;ummate Policy, or thro' the Principle of Honour it&s;elf, working blindly for it's own Pre&s;er|vation, the dangerous Propo&s;al was <HI>weakly</HI> or <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> rejected. Whenever this Over|ture meets with Acceptance and Succe&s;s, tho' it may &s;eem for a while to give Vigour to their State, yet from that Period we may date the Downfall of <HI>France.</HI> Their effeminate Manners, now controuled by <HI>Oeconomy</HI> and the Love of <HI>Glory,</HI> will, like ours, degenerate into <HI>Profu&s;ion</HI> and the Love of <HI>Gold.</HI></P>
<P>ON the contrary; Trade, tho' encouraged, is by the ruling Principle of this great Mo|narchy, kept within it's proper Limits; and while the Merchant traver&s;eth Seas in Pur&s;uit of <HI>Gain,</HI> the Gentleman does the
<PB N="207" REF="202">
&s;ame in Pur&s;uit of <HI>Glory.</HI> Thus the two incompatible Provinces are kept di&s;tinct; and hence, while the <HI>French</HI> vie with us in <HI>Trade,</HI> they tower above us in <HI>Principle.</HI></P>
<P>NAY their very trading Settlements among foreign Nations are actuated by this ruling Principle in &s;uch a Manner, as to give a Splendor to their Monarchy and Commerce in the mo&s;t barbarous Cli|mates <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numerous Proofs might be given of this: At pre&s;ent it may &s;uffice to take one from a very fine Book lately publi&s;hed. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is u&s;ual among the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> to &s;hew an extreme Re&s;pect for their Con&s;ul.

If by Chance he take a Tour to <HI>Ro&s;etto,</HI> he carries a white Flag at the Ma&s;t of his Pinnace; and when he goes out of the Port, as likewi&s;e when he re|turns into it, he is &s;aluted by a general Di&s;charge of the Cannon of the <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els."</Q> <BIBL>NORDEN'S Travels in <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Nubia,</HI> Vol. i. p. 29.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus, while <HI>we</HI> are poorly in|fluenced by a &s;orry and mercantile Maxim,
<PB N="208" REF="203">
fir&s;t broached by a trading Mini&s;ter,<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of a Nation is it's <HI>true&s;t</HI> Honour;"</Q>the <HI>French</HI> conduct them&s;elves on an oppo|&s;ite and higher Principle,  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the <HI>Ho|nour</HI> of a Nation is its true&s;t Intere&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>IN Confirmation of what is here ad|vanced, we need only ca&s;t our Eyes on the Fortune and Fate of <HI>France,</HI> during the pre&s;ent Century. In the la&s;t War, &s;he was exhau&s;ted, tho' victorious: in the former, &s;he was both beaten and exhau&s;ted: In both the&s;e In&s;tances, it was weakly thought by every &s;uperficial Politician in <HI>England,</HI> that becau&s;e we had exhau&s;ted the Men
<PB N="209" REF="204">
and Money, we had de&s;troyed the Power of <HI>France.</HI> Experience hath told us the Rever&s;e: The Spirit of Honour and Union working at the Root, &s;oon re&s;tored tho&s;e Branches that War had &s;wept away, and have at length &s;hot them into their former Vigour and Luxuriancy.</P>
<P>HENCE then, we may learn an impor|tant Truth: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no incidental Events can make a Nation <HI>little,</HI> while the Principles remain that made it <HI>great."</HI></Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. X. The Conclu&s;ion</HEAD>
<P>FROM the&s;e accumulated Proofs, then it &s;eems evident, that our pre&s;ent effeminate Manners and Defect of Principle have ari&s;en from our exorbitant Trade and Wealth, left without Check, to their na|tural
<PB N="210" REF="205">
Operations and uncontrouled Influ|ence. And that the&s;e Manners, and this Defect of Principle, by weakening or de|&s;troying the national Capacity, Spirit of Defence, and Union, have produced &s;uch a general Debility as naturally leads to De|&s;truction.</P>
<P>WE might now proceed to confirm the&s;e Rea&s;onings, by Examples drawn from Hi&s;tory. For there is hardly an ancient or modern State of any Note recorded in Story, which would not in one Re&s;pect or other, confirm the leading Principles on which this Argument is built.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e, throughout their &s;everal Periods, we &s;hould &s;ee <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Wealth,</HI> or (what is in this re&s;pect equivalent) <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> and <HI>Opulence,</HI> taking their Progre&s;s: At one Period, poli&s;hing
<PB N="211" REF="206">
and &s;trengthening; at another, refin|ing, corrupting, weakening, de&s;troying, the State that gave them Entrance: Working indeed in different Ways, and under a Variety of Appearances; by Ava|rice, by Faction, by Effeminacy, by Pro|fligacy; by a Mixture and Combination of all the&s;e Evils: &s;ometimes dividing a Na|tion again&s;t it&s;elf; at others, quelling it's Spirit, and leaving it an ea&s;y Prey to the fir&s;t Invader: Sometimes checked by a ri&s;ing Patriot, or counterworked by national Misfortunes: In one Country corrupting Manners; in another, Principles; in a third, both Manners and Principles: ren|dering one People blind, another cowardly, another treacherous to it&s;elf: Stealing &s;e|cretly and in&s;en&s;ibly on one Nation; over|whelming another in &s;udden De&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="207">
BUT to enlarge on the&s;e Subjects in that vague and undi&s;tingui&s;hing Manner, which mo&s;t Writers have pur&s;ued in treating them, tho' it might carry the <HI>Appearance</HI> of Rea|&s;oning, would in Truth be no more than <HI>Declamation</HI> in Di&s;gui&s;e. And to develope and unravel the Particularity of Cau&s;es and Effects, thro' all their Variety of Combina|tion and mutual Influence, as it would ex|tend this E&s;timate beyond it's de&s;igned Limits, mu&s;t be left to make a Part of &s;ome future Enquiry.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Character, Effects,</HI> and <HI>Sources</HI> of our Manners and Principles, being thus laid open, the Writer had it in his Thoughts to have proceeded to the Con&s;ideration of <Q REND="inline">"their mo&s;t practicable Remedies."</Q> But as the Clo&s;et-<HI>Projects</HI> of retired and &s;pecu|lative Men, often <HI>are,</HI> and always are <HI>re|guarded,</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="208">
as <HI>chimerical;</HI> he was therefore un|willing, at pre&s;ent, to hazard the Di&s;credit of &s;uch an Attempt.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, le&s;t his Attempt &s;hould be deemed more vi&s;ionary than perhaps it is, he judged it not improper to hint at &s;ome of the leading Principles on which it is built. And with this View, the following Reflections are &s;ubmitted to the Con&s;ide|ration of the Public.</P>
<P>THE World has been long amu&s;ed with a trite and hacknied Compari&s;on between the Life of Man, and that of States; in which it is pretended that they both pro|ceed in the &s;ame irrevocable Manner; from Infancy to Maturity, from Maturity to Death: A Compari&s;on, perhaps as groundle&s;s as it is common. The human Body contains, in its very Texture, the
<PB N="214" REF="209">
Seeds of certain Di&s;&s;olution. That is, tho' you &s;et a&s;ide all the po&s;&s;ible Accidents ari&s;ing from Intemperance, from the In|fluence of the Elements, the Climate, and every other external and contingent Cau&s;e the human Frame it&s;elf, after a certain Period, would grow into Rigidity; the Fluids would decrea&s;e, the Solids accumu|late, the Arteries <HI>o&s;&s;ify,</HI> the Blood &s;tagnate, and the Wheels of Life &s;tand &s;till.</P>
<P>BUT in Societies, of whatever Kind, there &s;eems no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary or e&s;&s;ential Tendency to Di&s;&s;olution. The human Body is <HI>naturally</HI> mortal; the political, only &s;o by <HI>Accident:</HI> Internal Di&s;orders or Di&s;ea&s;es may ari&s;e; External Violence may attack or overpower: but the&s;e Cau&s;es, tho' always to be expected, are wholly in|cidental: the fir&s;t is preci&s;ely of the &s;ame Nature as Intemperance, the &s;econd as
<PB N="215" REF="210">
the Influence of the external Elements, on the human Body. But there appears no|thing in the internal Con&s;truction of any State, that tends inevitably to Di&s;&s;olution, analogous to tho&s;e Cau&s;es in the human Frame, which lead to certain Death.</P>
<P>THIS Ob&s;ervation &s;eems confirmed by Hi&s;tory: Where you &s;ee States, which, after being &s;unk in Corruption and Debility, have been brought back to the Vigour of their fir&s;t Principles: But you mu&s;t have recour&s;e to Fables, for medicated Old Age, re&s;tored to Infancy or Youth.</P>
<P>IF this be true, it &s;eems not altogether chimerical, tho' confe&s;&s;edly difficult, to bring about the Reformation of a State. To lay down general Rules, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, would be like giving a <HI>Panacea;</HI> the very
<PB N="216" REF="211">
<HI>Empirici&s;m</HI> of Politics. The Remedies mu&s;t be &s;uited to the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een, that the ruling Evils of our Age and Nation have ari&s;en from the unheeded Con&s;equences of our Trade and Wealth. That the&s;e have produced effeminate Manners, and occa&s;ioned Lo&s;s of Principle: That the&s;e have brought on a national Debility. But would the le&s;|&s;ening this exorbitant Trade and Wealth bring back Manners and Principles, and re&s;tore the Nation's Strength?&mdash;I very much Que&s;tion the Event.</P>
<P>BUT whatever the Con&s;equences might be at <HI>Home,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Abroad</HI> would certainly be fatal. The <HI>French</HI> are every Day gain|ing upon us in Commerce; and if ours &s;hould le&s;&s;en, theirs would increa&s;e to our De&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="212">
THUS are we fallen into a kind of Di|lemma: If our Commerce be maintained or increa&s;ed, its Effects bid fair to de&s;troy us: If Commerce be di&s;couraged and le&s;|&s;ened, the growing Power of our Enemy threatens the &s;ame Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eems, then, no other Expe|dient than this, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Commerce and Wealth be not di&s;couraged in their <HI>Growth;</HI> but checked and <HI>controuled in their Effects."</HI></Q></P>
<P>AND even in attempting this, Care mu&s;t be had, le&s;t in controuling the Effects of Commerce, we &s;hould de&s;troy Commerce it&s;elf.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee how &s;trongly the natural Effects of Trade and Wealth, are controuled in
<PB N="218" REF="213">
<HI>France,</HI> by proper Checks and counteract|ing Principles: Yet mere Imitation is always a narrow, and often an ineffectual Scheme. Be&s;ides, as our Con&s;titution is of a &s;uperior Nature, &s;o our Manners and Principles mu&s;t be adapted to it, ere it can obtain it's proper Strength.</P>
<P>THE Virtues yet left among us, and enumerated above <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Part I. Sect. 2, 3, 4.</NOTE>, may be a po&s;&s;ible Foundation for &s;uch a Change.</P>
<P>THERE are two different Kinds of Re|medies, which might in due Time be ap|plied. The fir&s;t are radical, general, and la&s;ting: The latter, palliative, particular, and temporary.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;eem totally impracticable at <HI>pre&s;ent:</HI> For as they &s;uppo&s;e a Change of
<PB N="219" REF="214">
Manners and Principles, this may ju&s;tly be regarded as an impo&s;&s;ible Event, during the pre&s;ent Age; and rather to be wi&s;hed than hoped for, in the next.</P>
<P>THE palliative, particular, and tempo|rary Remedies, may &s;eem more practicable at this Juncture. I mean, tho&s;e which are of the coercive Kind; which work by oppo&s;ed Pa&s;&s;ions, or by de&s;troying the Opportunities or Occa&s;ions of Evil. Where the ruling Mi&s;chiefs lie among the People, the&s;e Remedies, with proper Care, may ea&s;ily be admini&s;tered. Thus we have lately &s;een the &s;alutary Effects of a new Kind of Police, e&s;tabli&s;hed by a u&s;e|ful Magi&s;trate in the City of <HI>London;</HI> by which, the reigning Evil of <HI>Street-Robberies</HI> hath been almo&s;t wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; altho' we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, the Di&s;po&s;ition towards them remains as &s;trong as ever.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="215">
BUT where the ruling Mi&s;chief de&s;olates the Great, there, even the palliative Re|medies cannot ea&s;ily be applied: The Rea|&s;on is manife&s;t: A coercive Power is wanting: They who &s;hould cure the Evil are the very Delinquents: And moral or political Phy&s;ic is what no di&s;tempered Mind will ever admini&s;ter to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>NECESSITY therefore, and <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity alone,</HI> mu&s;t in &s;uch a Ca&s;e be the Parent of Reformation. So long as degenerate and unprincipled Manners can &s;upport them|&s;elves, they will be deaf to Rea&s;on, blind to Con&s;equences, and ob&s;tinate in the <HI>long</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed Pur&s;uit of <HI>Gain</HI> and <HI>Plea|&s;ure.</HI> In &s;uch Minds, the Idea of a Public has no Place; and therefore can never be a Curb to private Gratification: Nor can &s;uch Minds be ever awakened from their
<PB N="221" REF="216">
fatal Dream, till either the Voice of an abu&s;ed People rou&s;e them into Fear; or the State it&s;elf totter, thro' the general Incapacity, Cowardice, and Di&s;union of tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;upport it.</P>
<P>WHENEVER this compelling Power, <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> &s;hall appear; then, and not till then, may we hope that our Deliverance is at hand. Effeminacy, Rapacity, and Faction, will then be ready to re&s;ign the Reins they would now u&s;urp: One com|mon Danger will create one common In|tere&s;t: Virtue may ri&s;e on the Ruins of Corruption; and a de&s;pairing Nation yet be &s;aved, by the Wi&s;dom, the Integrity, and un&s;haken Courage, of SOME GREAT MINISTER.</P>
