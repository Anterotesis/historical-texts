<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>MRS. STANLEY TO CHARLES EVELYN.</HEAD>
<P>WHY, thou dear Don, all Dons ex|celling, from Don Bellianis of Greece, to Don Di&s;mallo Thick&s;kullo Half|witto, of Spain, how &s;hall I be able to accommodate my &s;tyle to thy romantic &s;trains? Upon my life, Charles, a few &s;uch lovers as you would be &s;ufficient to
<PB N="2" REF="4">
re&s;tore the golden age of chivalry once more, and rein&s;tate our mortal &s;ex in their former rank of deities; altars and oblations would &s;oon become the <HI>ton,</HI> and the <HI>grand tour</HI> be exchanged for pilgrimages to our &s;hrines.</P>
<P>But for my own part I &s;hould never be able to endure &s;uch formal modes of proceeding&mdash;I &s;hould hate to be &s;tuck up in a niche to be prayed to. I dare &s;wear that, as mu&s;ic is generally a con|commitant of devotion, I &s;hould be tempted on the &s;ound of a fiddle to &s;tep down, take my kneeling votary by the hand, and fri&s;k a cotillon with him.</P>
<P>Your Julianas, and your Emmas are the right &s;ort of people for &s;uch Platonic court&s;hip&mdash;Gentle creatures, who are apt to &s;igh and look pale by the hour, with|out being able to tell why.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
But now, to relieve part of your fond anxiety, I &s;hall acquaint you that the fair Juliana's health is better than when I wrote la&s;t to you; though I cannot flatter you with the lea&s;t hope, that her di&s;po&s;ition towards you is the lea&s;t amended by her getting the better of her indi&s;po&s;ition&mdash;And therefore, my dear, dear brother, let me &s;eriou&s;ly en|treat you to re&s;olve upon conquering this &s;ame&mdash;I was very near calling it a <HI>non&s;en&s;ical</HI> pa&s;&s;ion<HI>&mdash;hopele&s;s,</HI> you acknow|ledge it to be; and there needs nothing more to render it &s;ynonymous.</P>
<P>Why you out-do Petrarch him&s;elf in con&s;tancy&mdash;For dame Laura, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;ublimity of her virtue, co|quetted a little with him now and then; and whenever &s;he thought that her cru|elty would kill&mdash;or cure him&mdash;&s;he treated him with a kind glance, or a few civil &s;peeches, to keep him and his hopes too
<PB N="4" REF="6">
from expiring.&mdash;Have you met with this charming book? the Life of Petrarch I mean&mdash;'Tis univer&s;ally, and I will &s;ay ju&s;tly, admired; becau&s;e Mr. Stanley, who you know, brother, <HI>ecce &s;ignum,</HI> has a good ta&s;te, ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ees with me in thinking it one of the mo&s;t entertaining works that has been publi&s;hed the&s;e many years&mdash;and yet I would not have you read it; becau&s;e I fear the delicate and tender &s;entiments it abounds with, might &s;erve to &s;uper-refine you too much.</P>
<P>I am all impatience to know whether Mi&s;s Harley went with you to Ireland, and how you like the people and the country, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I &s;hewed your letter to Emma, and &s;he &s;eemed to feel a little jealou&s;y at your not addre&s;&s;ing it to her in&s;tead of me; but I told her, what I believe to be true, that the hint was equally meant

&s;or us both; and may &s;ay, with regard to Madame Dupont, that it was needle&s;s to either; for from a thorough know|ledge of her character, in which I confe&s;s I had been much deceived, we have con|ceived a mutual di&s;like to her&mdash;This however &s;he either does not, or will not, &s;ee; for &s;he continues to vi&s;it my &s;i&s;ter De&s;mond very frequently, who is much too gentle to expre&s;s her di&s;approbation of Madame by any &s;tronger means than cold civility, which would be to me as forbidding as rudene&s;s&mdash;but Madame laughs away with Sir James, and takes not the lea&s;t notice of Emma's pouting&mdash;upon my honour, if I was in Emma's &s;ituation, I &s;hould do &s;ome|thing more than pout; I am &s;ure I &s;hould go &s;o far as to &s;hut my doors again&s;t her; and indeed every one ought to di&s;countenance her; for it is certainly true, that Lady Morton, who was one of
<PB N="6" REF="8">
the fonde&s;t mothers, is at this moment boarded and lodged in a little hovel near London, to prevent her being thrown into gaol for debts which &s;he contracted to indulge the vanity of her worthle&s;s daughter, who neither &s;ees nor affords her any other kind of con&s;olation&mdash;From my heart I pity the young man who is married to her&mdash;A bad daughter never did, or will, make a good wife&mdash;A defect in principle runs through the whole ma&s;s, in morals as well as chemi&s;try. Gratitude is the mo&s;t natural of all virtues; becau&s;e it is the fir&s;t affection that children become &s;u&s;ceptible of.</P>
<P>Do you know that Emma and Mr. Stanley are both jealous of our cor|re&s;pondence, though I &s;hew them your letters&mdash;but not my own&mdash;for I hate to

<P>O Charles! the trea&s;ures of my Lu|cy's mind have been concealed till now; beneath the ma&s;k of gaiety &s;he hid the tendere&s;t, noble&s;t feelings of the heart, the ju&s;te&s;t &s;entiments, and the mo&s;t per|fect <HI>female</HI> under&s;tanding&mdash;I glory in doing ju&s;tice to her &s;ex&mdash;Wherefore do blockheads affect to compliment a wo|man

<P>Did you imagine that I &s;hould ever become &s;uch a champion for the ladies? <Q>But what can't a charming woman do?</Q> The di&s;covery of your &s;i&s;ter's uncommon merits, which were con|cealed by mode&s;ty alone, have rendered me &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;t with regard to wo|men, that I cannot addre&s;s a chamber|maid

<P>MOST willingly, my friend, do I return to my colours, and renew a cor|re&s;pondence from which I have ever re|ceived the &s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure, though no part of it ever afforded me more than your la&s;t letter&mdash;O Stanley, how much are you to be envied! But envy is a mean, contemptible vice, and utterly in|compatible with friend&s;hip; I therefore
<PB N="13" REF="15">
do not envy, but rejoice, in your felicity, though certain that I am for ever barred from ta&s;ting bli&s;s like yours; for well I know that heart-felt happine&s;s is only to be found in a tender and virtuous con|nection with the object of our love and e&s;teem; and that, alas! can never be my lot&mdash;My youth mu&s;t pa&s;s away in gloomy, dreary, pining di&s;content. Would it were pa&s;&s;ed, and that like Aetna, though my bo&s;om flamed, my head was crowned with &s;now.&mdash;Here let me drop the painful &s;ubject, and never, never, rea&s;&s;ume it more.</P>
<P>After a very agreeable journey, which would have been &s;till more &s;o, had we not been encumbered with Mi&s;s Harley&mdash;Heavens! that any thing which bears that name &s;hould be to me unplea&s;ing!&mdash;We arrived at Holyhead&mdash;But I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe the delight|fully romantic wildne&s;s of the country

through which we pa&s;&s;ed to it&mdash;From thence we embarked for Dublin; and without &s;torm, tempe&s;t, or any other &s;i|ni&s;ter accident, arrived there in about eight hours. As Mi&s;s Harley has taken up her abode at Captain Harri&s;on's, I have declined his friendly entreaties to become his gue&s;t, but am lodged very near his hou&s;e in Kildare-&s;treet.</P>
<P>Yes, Stanley, Mi&s;s Harri&s;on is very &s;en&s;ible; &s;he has what I call a true <HI>feminine</HI> under&s;tanding, and is therefore more capable of in&s;piring love, than tho&s;e ladies who are complimented with a <HI>ma&s;culine</HI> one. For I mu&s;t di&s;&s;ent from your opinion, that there is no character|i&s;tic di&s;tinction between the under&s;tand|ings of the &s;exes&mdash;Manly &s;en&s;e has &s;ome|thing awful in it. When Dr. John&s;on &s;peaks, we li&s;ten with re&s;pect and admi|ration, and feel our minds impre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch an attentive kind of veneration, as

When Mrs. Montagu, in the pure&s;t and mo&s;t elegant language, delivers &s;enti|ments equally ju&s;t and &s;ublime as his, we are &s;urpri&s;ed and delighted; the grace|fulne&s;s of her manner &s;eems to add beau|ty to her thoughts; her words &s;ink into our hearts, like the &s;ofte&s;t &s;ounds of the mo&s;t perfect harmony, and produce the &s;ame placid effects.</P>
<P>I have now illu&s;trated my opinion by the two mo&s;t &s;triking characters, in point of under&s;tanding, that this, or any other age has produced. The difference be|tween ma&s;culine and feminine under|&s;tandings appears to me as perfectly di&s;|tinct, as the contra&s;ted &s;tyle of excellence which is ob&s;ervable in the Apollo Bel|videre, and the Venus of Medicis.</P>
<P>I am extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by Mi&s;s Harley's conduct, or rather mi&s;conduct
<PB N="16" REF="18">
&mdash;She certainly obtruded her&s;elf upon the Harri&s;ons contrary to their inclina|tions; though their humanity and good breeding would not permit them to re|fu&s;e her accompanying them to Ireland. During our journey, and ever &s;ince our arrival here, &s;he has &s;eemed to affect a particular attachment to me, yet talks perpetually in an ambiguous and ran|corous &s;tyle of Lady Juliana.</P>
<P>Simple woman! were I even indif|ferent to her charming &s;i&s;ter-in-law, I &s;hould dete&s;t her, for the malignant di&s;|po&s;ition &s;he hourly betrays&mdash;She throws out frequent hints of her having &s;ome-thing particular to communicate to me; but I am re&s;olved never to li&s;ten to the envenomed tale, for &s;uch I am &s;ure it would be.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time I &s;hall be freed from the irk&s;omene&s;s of her company, as Cap|tain

<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>O MARIA! how do I cur&s;e the day that I left my own country for this land of &s;avages.&mdash;Though, to be ju&s;t, I mu&s;t allow that the once highly favoured Evelyn is a more inhuman being than any I have yet &s;een here.&mdash;What an e&s;cape had you, my dear girl, of this &s;ame i&s;icle? I really begin to think that his heart is "&s;ou&s;ed in &s;now," as Ma|dame de l'Enclos &s;ays of Sevign&eacute;, which neither your bright eyes or mine can thaw. I am &s;incerely
<PB N="19" REF="21">
&s;orry that I have given my&s;elf &s;o much trouble about &s;uch an in&s;en&s;ible wretch.&mdash;I could almo&s;t go mad with vexation, if it were not for the comfortable remem|brance of his having &s;lipt through your fingers, when you thought your&s;elf al|mo&s;t &s;ure of him&mdash;pardon me, Maria, for confe&s;&s;ing that this circum&s;tance abates my mortification a little.</P>
<P>To you I will further own, that I was prompted full as much by &s;pite, as love, to endeavour at this conque&s;t; and I would &s;till give a finger, nay, a whole limb, to rob that affected in&s;ipid lady Juliana of his affections; even if I did not care &s;ix pence for the man.&mdash;Heavens! how I hate her and lady De&s;mond: I am &s;ure they are both hypocrites&mdash;but the men are &s;uch ideots as to admire the&s;e flat pictures of &s;till-life, and prefer them even to you or me.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
But I beg pardon for abu&s;ing your friend Lady De&s;mond; for though I am certain you cannot really like her, yet I hear you are va&s;tly intimate.&mdash;For my own part I dete&s;t the whole race of the Evelyns, next to my &s;i&s;ter-in-law.</P>
<P>You will, I dare &s;ay, expect &s;ome account of the&s;e Harri&s;ons that I came over with.&mdash;The girl is naturally lively, and tolerably agreeable: I fancied, at fir&s;t, that &s;he was in love with Evelyn, and hated her accordingly; but I begin now to think I was mi&s;taken, though &s;he profe&s;&s;es <HI>a tender friend&s;hip</HI> for him.&mdash;Ridiculous!</P>
<P>Captain Harri&s;on is hand&s;ome and well-bred; but has a &s;trong turn to ri|dicule, which I believe is a national qualification.&mdash;He &s;ometimes rallies Evelyn, who is really the knight of the &s;orrowful countenance, upon his me|lancholy
<PB N="21" REF="23">
and re&s;erve; but his rallery has no effect&mdash;how &s;hould it? nothing can penetrate that obdurate heart.&mdash;I now wi&s;h that I had be&s;towed my affections on the Captain; my fortune, at lea&s;t, would have been a de&s;irable object to him, though it is none to the &s;avage Evelyn.&mdash;But it is too late to think of that at pre&s;ent, for both the brother and &s;i&s;ter have ob&s;erved my attachment to this iron man.</P>
<P>I don't know why, but I don't be|lieve either of the Harri&s;ons like me, though they are extremely civil to me; but that is no proof of regard from the people of this country, as their ho&s;pi|tality is unbounded to &s;trangers, who generally laugh at, and de&s;pi&s;e them, for their officious kindne&s;s.&mdash;I &s;hall avail my&s;elf of their generofity by &s;taying here &s;ome time, if it were only to per&s;ecute Evelyn; for, alas!

<P>Write to me, my dear Maria, and give me a full and true account of every thing that you think will rai&s;e my &s;pirits, and enable me to &s;upport the mortifica|tions I daily &s;uffer.&mdash;You know the &s;ort of intelligence from whence alone I can derive comfort.</P>
<P>How does your Caro Spo&s;o? is he as civil and as &s;illy as u&s;ual, or has he a&s;|&s;umed the lordly airs of an Engli&s;h hu&s;|band?

<P>THE tran&s;ient gleams of returning health and chearfulne&s;s, which I boa&s;ted to my Lucy, are again vani&s;hed, like the morning dews before the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>The joy I felt at &s;eeing a much loved and long ab&s;ent brother, was of that &s;pecies that I hoped might have been in|dulged, without fearing to ta&s;te of tho&s;e bitter dregs that have ever been largely mingled in my cup. For above the&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="26">
three weeks, in this &s;weet retirement, with him and his friend Lord Somers, did I enjoy &s;uch a tranquil kind of hap|pine&s;s, as made me almo&s;t forget that I had been wretched.</P>
<P>The unhappy &s;eparation between our parents on account of their religion, had occa&s;ioned the &s;ame misfortune between my brother and me.&mdash;My mother, who was a catholic, when &s;he parted from my father, took me with her to Dijon, where I remained till heaven was plea&s;ed to deprive me of this mo&s;t indulgent pa|rent, and teach my youthful heart to feel too early &s;orrow.</P>
<P>At twelve years old I returned into England to my father, who, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every virtue, had an au&s;te|rity of manners that rendered him more the object of my fear than love. My
<PB N="25" REF="27">
brother was all kindne&s;s to me, heard all my little complaints, and &s;oothed my private griefs. Judge then, my Lucy, how I loved him?&mdash;When I was about &s;eventeen we underwent a &s;econd &s;epara|tion.&mdash;He was &s;ent to travel&mdash;had he &s;taid in England, I think I &s;hould not have been what now, alas! I am.&mdash;But that is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>After what I have &s;aid, will you not doubt my veracity, when I tell you that, within the&s;e ten days, that once kind and tender brother is become cold, di&s;tant, and re&s;erved to me, and treats me like an alien to his heart! and all becau&s;e I cannot be&s;tow <HI>mine</HI> upon his friend Lord Somners.&mdash;Hourly I am per&s;ecuted with the flippant addre&s;&s;es of this unge|nerous peer.&mdash;How highly is Mr. Evelyn's conduct, towards me, exalted by &s;o marked a contra&s;t!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28">
Lord Somners is about &s;even and thirty, and has lived abroad the&s;e twenty years; his dre&s;s, manners, and attendants are all exotic; his per&s;on is far from being di&s;agreeable; but then he &s;eems to think of it more highly than it de&s;erves, and has &s;ometimes dropt hints of my being engaged in a prior attachment, from my regarding his attractions with &s;o much indifference. He bows, &s;ighs, and &s;ings, in a regular routine, and is, in &s;hort, the mo&s;t complete petit-ma&icirc;tre I ever had the misfortune to conver&s;e with.</P>
<P>You will naturally imagine that I might ea&s;ily &s;ilence &s;uch a lover, or at lea&s;t bear his impertinence with &s;ilent contempt; but with all the &s;eeming vo|latility I have de&s;cribed, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a dark, &s;ubtle, and, I fear, a treacherous heart.&mdash;He has gained the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;|cendancy over my brother's mind, and is perpetually poi&s;oning it with the mo&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="29">
acrimonious re&s;entment again&s;t me.&mdash;How this affair will end, with regard to the latter I mean, I know not; but this I am certain of, that no power on earth &s;hall ever compel me to enter into any engagement with &s;uch a man as Lord Somners. Having once been led a trembling victim to the altar, where all my peace and happine&s;s were &s;acri|ficed, I never will renew that &s;cene of guilt, and its attendant, mi&s;ery, again.</P>
<P>I would quit Richmond in&s;tantly, and go&mdash;I know not whither&mdash;but that I fear to offend my brother; my tender|ne&s;s for him, is &s;o mingled with re|&s;pect, that there is but one &s;ubject on which I &s;hould feel it po&s;&s;ible to di&s;&s;ent from his will, or to know that I had one of my own.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>MRS. STANLEY TO LADY JULIANA HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>I WISH I was a conjurer for your &s;ake, my dear Juliana, but as I hap|pen not to be inve&s;ted with any of the occult qualities, and do not know a word of the Cabala, I find it impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend your incomprehen&s;ible lady|&s;hip&mdash;I confe&s;s my&s;elf &s;uch an ab&s;olute ignoramus, as not to under&s;tand why your health and &s;pirits &s;hould decline, becau&s;e your brother has propo&s;ed your marrying a fooli&s;h Lord, whom you di&s;|like.
<PB N="30" REF="32">
&mdash;For my own part, I think I love Charles Evelyn as well as any &s;i&s;ter loves her brother; but had he taken it into his head to propo&s;e my marrying any no|ble Lord, who&s;e name and title was re|gi&s;tered in the Court Calendar, I &s;hould have an&s;wered, No, brother, I thank you, I beg leave to chu&s;e for my&s;elf, and not be directed by an almanack&mdash;And had he thought proper to grow &s;ulky upon &s;uch denial, I might have been a little &s;orry for the di&s;appointment of his va|nity, but, I will venture to &s;ay, I &s;hould neither have lo&s;t my re&s;t, appetite, or &s;pirits, upon the occa&s;ion&mdash;And yet you know that till the other day I was but a &s;imple &s;pin&s;ter, and you are a grave, and, I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, wi&s;e relict, and have therefore a better right to judge for your|&s;elf; particularly, as I believe your in|clinations were not much con&s;ulted in your former connection.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33">
Indeed, Lady Juliana, you treat this matter much too &s;eriou&s;ly, and from thence it has acquired a degree of im|portance, which it is by no means in|titled to&mdash;Surely you have not only a negative, but an ab&s;olute power, over your&s;elf; and if your brother is worthy of that re&s;pectful tenderne&s;s you feel for him, he cannot re&s;ent your exerting your right, where your happine&s;s, and your's only, is concerned.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured of this, my good friend, that it is our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which enables men to become tyrants&mdash;we have our&s;elves only to blame&mdash;and yet you gentle ones are not entitled to the merits you affect to have, as you yield more from indolence than re&s;ignation, and never comply without repining.</P>
<P>There's Emma, for in&s;tance, who I think has caught the &s;ighing &s;ickne&s;s
<PB N="32" REF="34">
from your lady&s;hip; &s;he &s;pends all her mornings in lamenting the mortification &s;he will &s;uffer in the evening from re|ceiving Madame Dupont, and &s;ome others of Sir James's gang, whom I think as bad as highwaymen, merely be|cau&s;e &s;he has not re&s;olution to order her doors to be &s;hut again&s;t them.</P>
<P>In vain do I remon&s;trate to her, that an appearance of habitual melancholy is more likely to alienate her hu&s;band's af|fections, than her venturing to expre&s;s her di&s;like of his companions can po&s;&s;ibly do&mdash;&s;he an&s;wers&mdash;"&s;he never did, nor ever will, oppo&s;e his inclinations"&mdash;&s;o broods over this moral &s;entiment, and &s;its pining all day in a corner,</P>
<Q>Like to the culver on the bared bough.</Q>
<P>Perhaps it is becau&s;e I am plentifully gifted with both, that I think &s;pirits, and &s;pirit too, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to render the marriage &s;tate happy&mdash;</P>
<Q><PB N="33" REF="35">
<LG>
<L>Not minds of melancholy &s;train,</L>
<L>Still &s;ilent, or that &s;till complain,</L>
<L>Can the dear bondage ble&s;s;</L>
<L>As well may heavenly concert &s;pring</L>
<L>From two old lutes with ne'er a &s;tring,</L>
<L>Or none be&s;ides the ba&s;s.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>I would not wi&s;h you to imagine, from what I have &s;aid, that I have a mind to play Termagant my&s;elf, or that I would wi&s;h any woman I love to un|dertake the r&ocirc;le; far from it, I a&s;&s;ure you&mdash;but I would wi&s;h my whole &s;ex to think, act, and &s;peak like rational beings, and not furni&s;h the men with an excu&s;e for treating us like babies while we are young, and de&s;pi&s;ing us as ideots when we are no longer &s;o.</P>
<P>But to return to your pre&s;ent &s;ituation,&mdash;I would by all means advi&s;e you to throw off the &s;elf-impo&s;ed re&s;traint you labour under, and &s;eriou&s;ly acquaint your brother with your di&s;like to Lord Som|ners;
<PB N="34" REF="36">
at the &s;ame time, gently reque&s;ting that he will prevent his right honourable|ne&s;s from per&s;ecuting you with his addre&s;|&s;es. If, after this, they &s;hould &s;till per&s;i&s;t in their ob&s;tinacy, order your carriage di|rectly, and do not &s;tay moping and fret|ting at Richmond.</P>
<P>I rejoice that any thing has made you think favourably of my poor Charles; for my own part I condemn his conduct, as being infinitely too romantic; but the object or heroine of his romance ought to &s;ee his folly in a kinder light; and I am plea&s;ed you do &s;o. How much do I wi&s;h it was in my power to improve that kindne&s;s into love&mdash;be a&s;&s;ured I would not de&s;ire to do &s;o, if I did not think that your union would contribute as much to your own happine&s;s as to his. Re|member, my dear Juliana, that this is the fir&s;t time I have ever gravely touched
<PB N="35" REF="37">
upon this &s;ubject&mdash;and I will now drop it for ever, if it offends you.</P>
<P>I know I need not apologize for the length of my letter&mdash;Country ladies love to have a great deal for their mo|ney, and I am &s;ure you will e&s;teem this a tolerable pennyworth.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear languid friend; rou&s;e your &s;pirits, and come among&s;t us, or I &s;hall very &s;hortly &s;tep to Richmond, and u&s;e a little gentle force to draw you from beneath the mournful cypre&s;s, or the weeping willow.</P>

<P>SURELY, my dear Mi&s;s Harley, this unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion of your's has di&s;turbed your mind a little; for in your &s;ober &s;en&s;es you could not have imagined that I ever had any &s;eri|ous thoughts of &s;uch an animal as Charles Evelyn&mdash;Slipt through my fingers, &s;ay you? Give me leave to tell you, that if I had cho&s;en to have held him, neither you nor your delicate &s;i&s;ter-in-law
<PB N="37" REF="39">
would have been able to have wre&s;ted him from me&mdash;but I hate your water-gruel, whining, &s;entimental men, and therefore never could have been your rival.</P>

<P>My Pis-aller, as you are plea&s;ed to call him, is the very be&s;t hu&s;band in the univer&s;e&mdash;Foreigners, in general, are better tempered than Engli&s;hmen, and not &s;o much infected with jealou&s;y&mdash;this is a lucky circum&s;tance for me, as I

<P>Your &s;i&s;ter-in-law is at her brother's &s;eat at Richmond&mdash;Lord Somners has propo&s;ed for her a great match, I a&s;&s;ure you, and which &s;he poor &s;impleton has refu&s;ed, becau&s;e &s;he don't like the man:&mdash;As if, <HI>dans ce &s;iecle,</HI> it &s;ignified who one married, provided there be a good for|tune to help one to &s;upport it. A hand|&s;ome woman will always have a number of admirers; and &s;he mu&s;t be hard to plea&s;e, indeed, if in a croud &s;he don't meet with one &s;he can like. Marriage, formerly, my mother &s;ays, u&s;ed to put an

<P>I perfectly agree with you that the Ladies Juliana and De&s;mond are a couple of hypocrites, but I think Mrs. Stanley wor&s;e than either of them; tho' hypocri&s;y, indeed, is not one of her fail|ings&mdash;She has written me a card, in an|&s;wer to an invitation of mine, civilly for|bidding me her hou&s;e! while Lady

De&s;mond, who has I own &s;ome cau&s;e to hate me, receives me with &s;uch an icy kind of politene&s;s, as would freeze, or rather petrify me, if the warmth of Sir James's reception did not make ample amends for the bleakne&s;s of her lady|&s;hip's air and manner.</P>

<P>You don't know how much you are obliged to me for devoting &s;o much of my time to you at pre&s;ent; for as I am the only female of my party, I am &s;ure they wait for me, and &s;o does my car|riage to whi&s;k me to them.</P>

<HEAD>MR. STANLEY TO MR. EVELYN.</HEAD>
<P>I TAKE up the pen to addre&s;s you in the &s;ame manner that Queen Anne's mini&s;ters u&s;ed to Lord Peterbo|rough, and write rather <HI>at</HI> than to you.</P>
<P>I hope you are by this time &s;et out on your tour, and think it highly probable that this may find you mea&s;uring &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;tupendous lu&s;us naturae, vul|garly called the Giant's Cau&s;eway&mdash;as if dame Nature, who is an admirable oeconomi&s;t, ever u&s;ed two means to pro|duce one end, and fir&s;t made giants
<PB N="44" REF="46">
merely to lift the&s;e ma&s;&s;y piles of quarry, which mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly grew in the very &s;pot where you will find them. We have &s;ome &s;uch &s;uper&s;tition, I think, with regard to Stonehenge al&s;o; but, like all other traditions, it is only believed by the ignorant; though, by the way, the learned have not yet been able to tell us how tho&s;e huge pillars were conveyed to Sali&s;bury plain; and I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e them to have &s;tarted up there of their own accord; though there are a &s;ort of philo&s;ophers who liberally en|dow &s;tupid and &s;luggi&s;h matter with both thought and action.</P>
<P>Now for matters le&s;s conjectural.&mdash;The ca&s;e is pretty plain, I think, with regard to Mi&s;s Harley; yet on the <HI>face</HI> of the evidence I am apprehen&s;ive &s;he will be <HI>non&s;uited,</HI> for I well remember that <HI>hers</HI> was not a beautiful <HI>one</HI> &s;ome dozen years ago.&mdash;I pity her &s;incerely, however; all
<PB N="45" REF="47">
un&s;ucce&s;sful pa&s;&s;ions are intitled to com|pa&s;&s;ion, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a female intere&s;t our humanity, much more than tho&s;e of our own &s;ex. There certainly cannot be a more aukward or mortify|ing &s;ituation for a woman, than that of being in love with a man who di&s;likes her. There is in this, as well as many other ca&s;es, an unju&s;t di&s;tinction made between the &s;exes, as there is a certain degree of di&s;grace attached to the idea of a rejected female, while a man may be refu&s;ed by half a dozen ladies, and pay his addre&s;&s;es to a &s;eventh, with as good a grace, as if &s;he had been the pri|mary object of his affections.</P>
<P>I am ready to agree with you with regard to the effects produced by differ|ent modes of ma&s;culine and feminine elocution, for that is the &s;ole di&s;tinction you have made, in your favourite in|&s;tance,
<PB N="46" REF="48">
between the two great geniu&s;es you have named.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ex in &s;ouls, and though Milton has been plea&s;ed to tell us, that on woman nature has</P>

<L>Too much of ornament, in outward &s;how</L>

<L>For well I under&s;tand in the prime end</L>
<L>Of nature, her the inferior, in the mind</L>
<L>And inward faculties, which mo&s;t excel.</L></Q>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to di&s;&s;ent from him, nay more, to &s;ay that he accu&s;es Provi|dence of a particular partiality in the di&s;po&s;al of his intellectual gifts, between the human race, which is by no means vi&s;ible in any other part of the animal creation. All in&s;tinctive qualities appear|ing to the full as &s;trong, and as acute, in the female as the male, through every &s;pecies of the animal world&mdash;Why then
<PB N="47" REF="49">
&s;hould we conceive that the highe&s;t order of beings, that inhabit this terre&s;|trial globe, &s;hould be more unequally dealt with? It is clear, at lea&s;t, that Milton did not rea&s;on from analogy.</P>
<P>Superior &s;trength of body appears to be the portion of the male through all degrees of exi&s;tence; from hence, and hence only, they have arrogated to them&s;elves an authoritative command over the weaker part of their &s;pecies&mdash;but Providencc, ever equal in the di&s;tri|bution of its bounty to his creatures, amply atoned for this &s;eeming partiality, by endowing the female part of the creation with beauty, to "&s;ubdue the &s;trong," tame the ferocious, and make their boa&s;ted &s;trength of no other value, but as it &s;erves for the pre&s;ervation and protection of the favourite female and her helple&s;s offspring.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">
I think I have now e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;exes upon an equal &s;cale, and fixed my propo&s;ition beyond the reach of contro|ver&s;y, I mean with regard to their natu|ral endowments, without the lea&s;t atten|tion to the adventitious circum&s;tances of education, which I am thoroughly per|&s;uaded makes all the difference between what is &s;tyled a ma&s;culine and feminine under&s;tanding. From you, who are a lover, I cannot expect any oppo&s;ition to the opinion I have advanced, but rather a folio of thanks for having rai&s;ed the dignity of your fair-one's nature, to an equality with that of the <HI>&s;elf-named</HI> lords of the creation.</P>

<P>Now, Lucy, judge what I mu&s;t have felt, what I &s;till feel, from this enve|nomed dart! yet I know not the &s;haft from whence it came; for, heaven &s;o help me at my greate&s;t need, as I with truth affirm, I do not know a per&s;on living that I have ever injured.</P>

<HEAD>MISS HARLEY TO MADAME DUPONT.</HEAD>
<P>DEAR Maria, the men &s;ay that the purport of a lady's letter is always con|tained in the po&s;t&s;cript; and were it not for that part of your la&s;t favour, I could not have forgiven the matronly airs you a&s;&s;umed in the re&s;t of it&mdash;but the kind a&s;&s;urance you give me of mortifying that hateful prude, my &s;i&s;ter-in-law, has bound me for ever to you&mdash;I am per&s;uaded if we were acquainted with her real hi&s;tory, we
<PB N="60" REF="62">
need not be obliged to invention to blacken her character; but &s;he is a con|&s;ummate hypocrite, and has cunning enough to keep her own &s;ecrets; &s;o that a &s;hrewd gue&s;s is all we have for it, and I think we have a right to make free with that.&mdash;Do not &s;pare her, Maria, I entreat you&mdash;I am &s;ure if &s;he was to be married to Lord Somners, it would break my heart.</P>
<P>Tho' I &s;hall &s;oon be entitled to be called your Lady&s;hip as well as &s;he, you &s;ee I am re&s;olved to take your advice, and not, like Jephtha's daughter, con|tinue to bewail my virginity any longer.</P>
<P>Tho' the bloom is a little worn off, as you &s;ay, the fruit is &s;till tempting enough to captivate a baronet, of one of the fir&s;t families in this land of genealogers.&mdash;Sir John O'Shaughna&s;y has laid his laurels
<PB N="61" REF="63">
at my feet, and opened his honourable trenches in due form before me.&mdash;He has been a &s;oldier in the Empre&s;s of Germany's &s;ervice, and has reaped more honour than wealth from the field; but that is of little con&s;equence, as my for|tune is quite &s;ufficient to maintain us in affluence in this country, where every thing is much cheaper than in England. My &s;wain has all the manners of a fo|reigner, &s;peaks French and German flu|ently, is above &s;ix foot high, and comely with all.&mdash;The&s;e little circum&s;tances are not ami&s;s, in my mind; for I cannot quite agree with you, "that it don't &s;ig|nify who one marries." I only wi&s;h I could change his name, for the &s;ake of my Engli&s;h friends, who I am &s;ure will pronounce it horridly; tho' I am cer|tain my &s;pou&s;e-elect would as &s;oon part with his life, as alter a &s;ingle letter of it.&mdash;But every one has their foible, and this I think is my baronet's only one.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64">
Do you know that the brute Evelyn has left Dublin without even bidding me farewel&mdash;He carried off Captain Harri&s;on with him, and their intentions were kept as profound a &s;ecret from me, as if they were going to invade an enemy's coun|try.&mdash;I believe the &s;ly Mi&s;s Harri&s;on was in the plot again&s;t me; but I am &s;uffici|ently revenged on her, by robbing her of Sir James O'Shaughna&s;y, who had dang|led after her for &s;ome time&mdash;A pretty Mi&s;s, indeed! with her three thou&s;and pounds, to think of being a lady! thank heaven, I have ten times that &s;um to be|&s;tow upon my worthy knight.</P>
<P>I will, if po&s;&s;ible, be married before Evelyn returns; for to &s;ay truth, I would not wi&s;h to &s;ee him in company with my lover, as I fear the comparifon might &s;hake my re&s;olution; and if he were but to &s;peak kindly to me, I might perhaps
<PB N="63" REF="65">
be fool enough to break with the baro|net&mdash;but do you think there is much danger of &s;uch an event?</P>
<P>I rejoice al&s;o at your mortifying Lady De&s;mond&mdash;&s;he is the &s;econd object of my aver&s;ion.&mdash;You are very lucky in be|ing married to a Frenchman; I fear if I was to amu&s;e my&s;elf with a little co|quetry, my baronet would be jealous, as he is &s;o di&s;tractedly in love with me; and it is not enough the mode here, for married women to be galant, to fami|liari&s;e the idea to him.</P>
<P>When I go to my hu&s;band's ca&s;tle in the country, I &s;hall obey your com|mands, by looking for a proper place to &s;ettle Lady Morton in; but, take my word, it &s;hall be far enough from me, for I hate poor relations, and I think her lady&s;hip claims kindred with my mo|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="66">
As you love me, Maria, proceed with caution again&s;t Lady Juliana; too much zeal often hurries us into mi&s;takes; a hint well thrown out, is frequently more &s;ucce&s;sful than a &s;tory un&s;upported by evidence; and, as I have already &s;aid, we have no other foundation to build upon but gue&s;s-work.</P>
<P>I have returned your compliment, by devoting time to you that is extremely precious to me; as I am certain my fond lover is now waiting with impatience to behold me enter the Rotunda, which you are to know is an humble imitation of Ranelagh.</P>

<HEAD>MR. EVELYN TO MR. STANLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Killarney.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter, my dear Stanley, found my imagination more agreeably occupied than you predicted, as I was ju&s;t then returned from viewing the beauties of the lake, which takes its name from this town&mdash;Believe me they are pa&s;t de&s;cription; and every attempt that has been made to expre&s;s the various ef|fu&s;ions
<PB N="66" REF="68">
of nature, in the different &s;cenes that con&s;titute the whole, falls infinitely &s;hort of the originals&mdash;Neither the poet's pen nor painter's pencil have yet been able to give an adequate idea of this tran&s;porting &s;pot.&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>Here nature wantons, as in her prime,</L>
<L>And plays at will her virgin fancies.</L></Q>
<P>The beautiful and &s;ublime are here mingled in the &s;uperlative degree; the great Creator's works, un&s;poiled by art, ru&s;h on the mind, and fill it with delight and awe.&mdash;The&s;e mixed &s;en&s;ations over|came my &s;pirits, nor do I blu&s;h to &s;ay I found relief from tears. I &s;hould look upon a man who could behold this &s;cene unmoved, to be deficient in &s;ome part of his organization, and pity him for his na|tural incapacity.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">
I &s;hall not fear to be thought an en|thu&s;ia&s;t upon this &s;ubject by you, who have &s;ublimed your ideas as far as they can reach upon a more exalted ob|ject&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Faire&s;t of creation!</L>
<L>La&s;t, and be&s;t, of all God's works.</L></Q>
<P>Believe me, I am highly charmed with your arguments upon this charming &s;ubject, and think with you, that if we rea&s;on from analogy, we mu&s;t give up our boa&s;ted &s;uperiority, and admit of an intellectual equality between the &s;ons and daughters of Adam. This po&s;ition granted, give me leave to &s;ay the &s;cale mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily preponderate in favour of the &s;ofter &s;ex, &s;ince all we have left to put in equi|poi&s;e again&s;t their <Q>beauty, winning &s;oftne&s;s, and attractive grace,</Q> amounts to nothing more than bodily &s;trength, and the few advantages that may be de|rived
<PB N="68" REF="70">
from a liberal education&mdash;The fir&s;t can never be oppo&s;ed to them; and the latter, by refining our ideas, renders us but the more &s;u&s;ceptible of their charms and endearments. To &s;um up all, wo|men are, and ever have been, the &s;o|vereigns of the world. But even mo|narchs are &s;ometimes rendered unhappy by the vice or folly of their &s;ubjects; and the hint you give me, with regard to my beloved Emma, has alarmed me va&s;tly&mdash;not that I doubt her reigning &s;ole and ab&s;olute in her hu&s;band's heart; it is his weakne&s;s, not her &s;trength, I fear.&mdash;Perhaps he has again been drawn into play, and in con&s;equence of his folly, his circum&s;tances may be again di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; I know that Emma's tenderne&s;s will &s;hare his &s;orrows without upbraiding; &s;he will mourn in &s;ecret, nor even, to a &s;i&s;ter's ear, reveal her hu&s;band's faults.&mdash;Gentle &s;ufferer! thou &s;halt be re|lieved.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71">
Be a&s;&s;ured that Emma would take as much, nay perhaps more, pains to con|ceal any difficulty &s;he may labour under, in pecuniary matters, from me, than any other per&s;on, and that from a point of delicacy.&mdash;It was hone&s;t Sewell, not &s;he, that informed me of Sir James De&s;|mond's circum&s;tances while I was at Bath; from him then I wi&s;h you to find out the &s;ituation of the baronet's finances; I think they cannot be much embar|ra&s;&s;ed, as his debts were all cleared upon his going to London, and if he is not quite a lunatic, he cannot have involved him&s;elf greatly &s;ince.&mdash;</P>
<P>But no matter what the &s;um is, if it be within my power&mdash;For of what u&s;e, but to make <HI>others</HI> happy, can my fortune be? Alas! it cannot render <HI>me</HI> &s;o!</P>
<P>Your not mentioning Lady Juliana in any of your letters I take unkindly;
<PB N="70" REF="72">
it is treating me like an infant, who for|gets his play-thing when it is removed from his &s;ight&mdash;Can you &s;uppo&s;e that I &s;hould cea&s;e to think, becau&s;e you do not &s;peak of the &s;ole object that occupies my mind?</P>
<P>My agreeable friend and fellow-tra|veller, grows impatient to return to England, as we have the plea&s;ure of hearing that Mrs. Williams's health is nearly e&s;tabli&s;hed.&mdash;I &s;hall be &s;orry to quit this kingdom with which I am ex|tremely charmed, as much with the peo|ple, from whom I have received infinite civilities, as with the place.&mdash;But not|with&s;tanding my reluctance, I &s;hall ac|company Captain Harri&s;on to Bri&s;tol, and u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t trea&s;ure this world can afford, an amiable wife.&mdash;I think it is almo&s;t needle&s;s to tell you that I mean to re&s;ign Captain Williams's
<PB N="71" REF="73">
legacy in favour of his widow; &s;urely I have no title to his fortune, and only held it in tru&s;t till &s;he was able to enjoy it.&mdash;The value of the gift will be en|hanced, by the plea&s;ure &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily receive from be&s;towing it on a man who&s;e fortune, though by no means contemptible, is far from being adequate to his genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>Captain Harrri&s;on's e&s;tate lies in a different province from this; he has bu|&s;ine&s;s there, I &s;hall attend him, and therefore &s;oon bid adieu to this Eden.&mdash;As I am &s;elf-bani&s;hed from London, it is of little con&s;equence in what part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions I re&s;ide.&mdash;Your letters will be forwarded to me with punctuality, and I &s;hall with impatience expect you to put it in my power to relieve my loved Emma's di&s;tre&s;s, by acquaint|ing me with the means that are wanting to her happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">
I beg to be indulged with an account of Lady Juliana's health, and of every thing that relates to yours, and my &s;i&s;|ter's welfare.&mdash;I live but in ye all.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER L.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CHARLES EVELYN TO WILLIAM STANLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Ro&s;common.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE po&s;t is come in without bring|ing me a letter, which is a real di&s;ap|pointment, becau&s;e I fear the delay may retard the happine&s;s of others as well as mine.</P>
<P>Harri&s;on's bu&s;ine&s;s will oblige us to &s;tay &s;ome days in this town, which is a very dull one, and the country round it
<PB N="74" REF="76">
le&s;s cultivated than any part of Ireland that I have yet &s;een.&mdash;The lands are entirely given up to pa&s;ture, and we have rode over plains of five or &s;ix and thirty miles in circumference, without &s;eeing the face, or even the ve&s;tige, of any human creature, excepting a few mi&s;erable huts, made up of mud and &s;traw, which ap|pear to be &s;carcely habitable. Yet this country is not without its curio&s;ities.&mdash;We went ye&s;terday to &s;ee a beautiful lake, about twenty miles from hence, which runs above twelve miles in length, and eighteen broad in many parts of it. Like that at Killarney it is bordered with flowering &s;hrubs of various kinds, which grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and on its banks are &s;ituated a number of gentlemen's &s;eats.&mdash;I acknowledge the &s;cene beautiful, yet it falls far &s;hort of the one ju&s;t men|tioned. It wants variety, and that luxuriant wildne&s;s that tran&s;cends the efforts of art.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
But here I was pre&s;ented with a curio|&s;ity of another kind, and of the fir&s;t magnitude. As Harri&s;on and I were riding on the edge of the lake, I ob|&s;erved a &s;mall brick hou&s;e of two &s;tories high, that &s;eemed to have no window, or at lea&s;t not one that looked upon the pro&s;pect I have de&s;cribed, though it &s;tood within a few yards of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful part of it.&mdash;I imme|diately enquired, what could that edifice be de&s;igned for? he replied it was the <HI>palace of a Prince,</HI> to who&s;e pre&s;ence he would endeavour to introduce me.&mdash;Of a lunatic, you mean, I an&s;wered, who is &s;elf-inve&s;ted with royalty.</P>
<P>You are mi&s;taken, &s;aid my friend, he is a real Prince, the Prince of Coolavin; his ance&s;tors were lords of this wide do|main, and his proud &s;pirit cannot bear to look upon tho&s;e lands, which he con|&s;iders as by right his own, though
<PB N="76" REF="78">
Cromwell tore the inheritance from his family, and reduced his patrimony to the &s;canty pittance of two hundred pounds a year. For this rea&s;on he has turned the back of his hou&s;e to this fair pro&s;pect, and looks with more delight upon his farm-yard.&mdash;But come, conti|nued he, as I am acquainted with the young Princes, I'll try if I can obtain admittance for us to the Monarch.</P>
<P>When we came near the hou&s;e it ap|peared, in front, a very decent building, with &s;a&s;h windows; clo&s;e by it &s;tood a &s;maller one, only one &s;tory high, at which we alighted, and on our entrance were received by four young gentlemen, with &s;uch politene&s;s as would have done honour to an higher roof.&mdash;The elde&s;t of the&s;e was heir apparent, and married to a very pretty young woman, of the name of O'Connor, de&s;cended from the King's of Mun&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79">
The &s;econd &s;on had been educated in France, and taken his degrees as a phy|&s;ician there.&mdash;The third was an officer in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice, now on a vi&s;it to his family; and the fourth was, I under|&s;tood, de&s;igned for the &s;ervice of the ca|tholic church.</P>
<P>On Captain Harri&s;on's expre&s;&s;ing our de&s;ire of paying our re&s;pects to the Prince, the elde&s;t, Mr. O'Dermot, &s;aid he would &s;ignify our reque&s;t to his father, and as Mr. Harri&s;on's mother was of a true Mile&s;ian family, he did not doubt his compliance. We were offered a va|riety of refre&s;hments, mo&s;t ho&s;pitably in|vited to dinner, and informed that we might immediately be introduced to the Dowager and Prince&s;s Con&s;ort.</P>
<P>We were then conducted by the Spa|ni&s;h officer into a &s;mall drawing-room, where my eyes were &s;truck with the mo&s;t
<PB N="78" REF="80">
venerable female figure they had ever beheld.&mdash;I declare, Stanley, I was al|mo&s;t tempted to bend the knee before her. She was tall, and of a maje&s;tic ap|pearance, yet had infinite &s;weetne&s;s in her countenance: &s;he was clothed in a blue dama&s;k dre&s;s, made like a man's night-gown; on her head &s;he wore what they call a kercher, of thin cambrick, and from that head hung down, even to her &s;eet, a profu&s;ion of the fine&s;t &s;il|ver tre&s;&s;es that Time had ever blanched. This reverend object brought to my mind that beautiful epithet in Shake|&s;peare, of <HI>Time-honoured Lanca&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>To my &s;urprize we were fir&s;t pre&s;ented to the young lady, who received us with a kind of dignified &s;ulkine&s;s, which was very di&s;gu&s;ting; while the elder lady's manners and appearance at once attracted our affection and re&s;pect.&mdash;She entered in&s;tantly into conver&s;ation with us, and
<PB N="79" REF="81">
among&s;t other things, informed us, that &s;he had been full forty years a wife, and that during that time &s;he had never pa&s;&s;ed the bounds of her &s;overeign's e&s;tate; though &s;he owned &s;he had once made an attempt to &s;ee a little more of the world when &s;he was young; her lord, &s;he &s;aid, was then from home, but the moment &s;he had <Q>pa&s;&s;ed the line,</Q> her hor&s;e threw her, and &s;he broke her arm in the fall.&mdash;She con&s;i|dered this incident as a judgment on her di&s;obedience, and had remained a contented pri&s;oner of her hu&s;band's mock-&s;tate ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>At length we were admitted to the Prince's pre&s;ence; his per&s;on was large, and &s;eemed to have been well made, his figure was erect, his eye piercing, and his countenance &s;evere; he was &s;eated in an oak great chair, from whence he did not deign to make the &s;malle&s;t in|clination
<PB N="80" REF="82">
of his body on our appearance, but &s;ternly a&s;ked the cau&s;e of Mr. Har|ri&s;on's de&s;iring to &s;ee him?&mdash;My friend was a little di&s;concerted by the que&s;tion, but &s;oon recovered him&s;elf, and with infinite politene&s;s replied, his vi&s;it was only meant as a mark of the &s;incere re|&s;pect he had been early taught to feel for the Prince of Coolavin.</P>
<P>The old man's features became then le&s;s au&s;tere, and he talked in an enrap|tured &s;train of the beauty of Harri&s;on's grandmother, who had, it &s;eems, the honour of being allied to him, and bore the name of O'Dermot.&mdash;He &s;carcely deigned to turn his eyes on me, and mine did not &s;olicit his attention, for they were attracted by an immen&s;e large coffin, covered with black cloth, that &s;tood on one &s;ide of the chamber; there was an in&s;cription on the plate in a lan|guage I did not under&s;tand, and there|fore
<PB N="81" REF="83">
&s;uppo&s;e to be Iri&s;h; and over the plate was a &s;omething like a coronet, but not appertaining to any rank of he|raldry that I was acquainted with. Over this gloomy apparatus was a &s;helf filled with &s;ome hundreds of wooden cups, neatly turned, which might each contain &s;omething le&s;s than half a pint; their appearance puzzled me, as they &s;eemed to be rather a part of the furni|ture of a turner's &s;hop, than of a Prince's pre&s;ence-chamber. On enquiry I was informed they were de&s;igned to be u&s;ed at the Prince's funeral, when they were to be filled with whi&s;ky, a &s;pecies of malt &s;pirit, the common beverage in this country, and given to each per&s;on who &s;hould attend his royal ob&s;equies to the ruins of an old mona&s;tery, which was about an hundred yards from his pre&s;ent man&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84">
When his Highne&s;s thought proper to di&s;mi&s;s us, we were conducted back to Mr. O'Dermot's, and had the honour of dining with the re&s;t of this mo&s;t extraordinary family.&mdash;The old Lady informed us, that not being royally de|&s;cended, &s;he had never been permitted to eat with the Prince, or to &s;it in his pre&s;ence, unle&s;s in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s, though he often indulged his daughter-in-law with the&s;e &s;pecial honours.&mdash;But &s;he is a Prince&s;s, added &s;he, and is therefore intitled to &s;uch di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>From the in&s;tant I heard this anec|dote, I took an aver&s;ion to the old &s;a|vage; and could ea&s;ily conceive that he wanted nothing but power to be an ad|mirable tyrant. I thought of him in the &s;ame light as one of the Caribbee i&s;landers, who, as Lord Kaims tells us, do not &s;uffer their wives to eat in their pre&s;ence, while the women of that
<PB N="83" REF="85">
country are &s;o remarkable for their &s;weet|ne&s;s of manners, obedience, and re&s;pect, to their brutal hu&s;bands, as never to give them occa&s;ion to remind them of their duty.</P>
<P>O, Stanley! what a falling off is here, from the pinnacle on which you and I have been labouring to place the fe|male party of our &s;pecies? But let it be remembered, that &s;avages only, treat women with haughtine&s;s or con|tempt.</P>
<P>During the time of dinner we had an old blind harper, who played and &s;ung ditties to us in the Iri&s;h language; &s;ome of the tunes were uncommonly &s;weet, and expre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t melan|choly. I was extremely charmed with the mu&s;ic, great part of which, the min|&s;trel told us, was extempore, as well as the words.&mdash;If I could have &s;poken his
<PB N="84" REF="86">
language, I &s;hould have been tempted to try if I could have prevailed on the old bard to have accompanied me to England; though Mr. O'Dermot a&s;&s;ured me, that O'Farrel, that is the harper's name, would not quit the Barony of Co&s;tello, for a thou&s;and pounds a year, but very politely added, that he &s;hould, if I plea&s;ed, attend me while I &s;taid at Ro&s;common.&mdash;I accepted his offer with thanks, and he returned in our fuite to this town.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay at Coolavin, I was extremely amu&s;ed with the &s;ingularity of the characters I there met with; but my tru&s;ty A&s;iatic Scipio was a much greater object of &s;urprize to the lower cla&s;s of the family, than the heads of it were to me.&mdash;They had never &s;een a black man before; and the Prince&s;s's waiting gentlewoman &s;ent off an expre&s;s
<PB N="85" REF="87">
for her &s;i&s;ter, who lived at the di&s;tance of eight miles, to come and &s;ee Kouli Khan, the King of the black-men, who &s;he &s;aid was come all the way from Tur|key to vi&s;it her ma&s;ter.&mdash;This was her geography about the matter.</P>
<P>It was very late when we got back to our inn; the night was fine and the roads good, and we travelled as &s;afe as at mid-day, for there are no &s;uch beings as highwaymen throughout this country; the robbing a hen-roo&s;t, &s;tealing a &s;heep, or a little whi&s;key, being the utmo&s;t of their mi&s;demeanors.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Stanley, I have written a long, and I hope amu&s;ing hi&s;|tory, and left you at liberty to make your own comments; for were I to tran&s;cribe the numberle&s;s reflections which occurred to me upon this ancient

Here lie two of your letters to my &s;pou&s;e, un|opened, and of cour&s;e unan&s;wered&mdash;Had they been addre&s;&s;ed to me, the ca&s;e would have been otherwi&s;e, for I love to read letters exceedingly; but you grew tired of my corre&s;pondence, for&s;ooth, and have left me off; &s;o that if I was not the be&s;t natured &s;i&s;ter in the world, I &s;hould not now take up the pen to acquaint
<PB N="88" REF="90">
you that my hu&s;band has eloped!&mdash;It is true, Charles&mdash;I have not &s;een him the&s;e ten days!&mdash;And who do you think has &s;pirited him away from me? why truly his grandfather, Sir John Stanley.&mdash;He is turned of ninety, and the expre&s;s that came from Devon&s;hire informed me that the good old gentleman could not hold out much longer; &s;o that I pre&s;ume he is now gathered to his fathers and grand|fathers, and I may be a Lady at this pre&s;ent writing for ought I know.</P>
<P>His knight&s;hip commanded me not to &s;end his letters after him, as he &s;hould not &s;tay a moment longer than decency required; for the old gentleman took care that affection or e&s;teem &s;hould be entirely out of the que&s;tion, by behaving like a &s;avage to his family all his life&mdash;But peace be with his &s;oul; and I am now glad that he has &s;aved his grand&s;on's feeling heart from being too
<PB N="89" REF="91">
much affected at his <HI>death&mdash;</HI>I had like to have &s;aid <HI>lo&s;s,</HI> from a figure of &s;peech that you &s;cholars term <HI>lap&s;us linguae.</HI></P>
<P>There is, perhaps, a latent kind of good-nature in behaving ill to one's near connections, for the rea&s;on I have hint|ed; but for my part I am &s;elfi&s;h enough to wi&s;h to be lamented when I die, and am therefore maliciou&s;ly re&s;olved to be|have as well as I can while I live.</P>
<P>I never was &s;o tempted to do a wrong thing, as I am at this moment to open your letters&mdash;But avaunt, foul fiend! tho' I know my &s;weet William will &s;ay&mdash;Why did you not, my love?</P>
<P>The temptation does not ari&s;e from mere curio&s;ity neither, but I wi&s;h to know how far you are acquainted with certain &s;ubjects, that I may not tire you with <HI>a twice told tale.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">
But even with the fear of repetition before my eyes, I will venture to &s;ay that our dear Emma is extremely happy&mdash;I have made many gue&s;&s;es at the cau&s;e, but tho' it is too plain that &s;he is on the rack, &s;he will not confe&s;s&mdash;O Charles, how grateful is my heart to Providence, for having ble&s;&s;ed me with &s;uch a hu&s;band as my Stanley! 'Tis true we have not been long married, and it may therefore appear pre&s;umption to expect a continuance of my pre&s;ent happine&s;s&mdash;It might be &s;o with any other man&mdash;but were his heart e&s;|tranged, which heaven avert! I know he would, from principle, lament his own defection, and hide his weakne&s;s from me.&mdash;I mu&s;t not tru&s;t my&s;elf upon this &s;ubject, for it is a theme on which my grateful heart could dwell for ever.</P>
<P>As I have an extreme good opinion of your under&s;tanding, I flatter my&s;elf
<PB N="91" REF="93">
you have by this time triumphed over your only weakne&s;s, and that you can now read the name of Juliana without tremor or palpitation&mdash;I will therefore venture to inform you that &s;he has re|fu&s;ed a match her brother propo&s;ed to her; and, in con&s;equence of her refu&s;al, a <HI>brouill&eacute;</HI> has happened between them.&mdash;She acquainted me with the&s;e circum|&s;tances before &s;he left Richmond&mdash;I fancy &s;he is gone into York&s;hire, as I have not heard from her lately, tho' I live in daily and anxious expectation of &s;ome further intelligence from her upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ad thing that this poor lady is not allowed to live &s;ingle if &s;he chu&s;es to do &s;o; but that right or wrong you men will marry her, whether &s;he will or no&mdash;Seriou&s;ly I think it cruel to per&s;ecute her into matrimony, becau&s;e I really believe &s;he is one of the few widows who wi&s;h
<PB N="92" REF="94">
to continue &s;o; and as I am &s;incerely in|tere&s;ted for her happine&s;s, I earne&s;tly wi&s;h &s;he was &s;uffered to po&s;&s;e&s;s it on her own terms.</P>
<P>A letter from Stanley&mdash;I give you joy of my Lady&s;hip, Charles, but feel much more from knowing that the dear di&s;|pen&s;er of all my happine&s;s is well, and will be in town in a very few days.&mdash;I wi&s;h I knew when I was to rejoice in your coming; for we all think that Em|ma, like Hamlet's Gho&s;t, "tho' dumb to us, will &s;peak to you"&mdash;Ha&s;te then, my prince, to fini&s;h your travels, and keep your court among&s;t us here.</P>

<HEAD>MADAME DUPONT TO MISS HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>JOY, double joy to you, my dear Harley! You are now triumphant in every thing&mdash;Good and bad fortune flow in a &s;tream, and the current runs at pre|&s;ent in your favour.</P>
<P>Our enemy is fled, and has left us mi&s;tre&s;s of the field!&mdash;I plyed my battery &s;o clo&s;e, that Lord Somners either was, or affected to be, convinced that Lady Ju|liana is every thing we wi&s;h to repre&s;ent

<P>And who think you was the hero of my tale? The very man &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected, your obdurate &s;wain, Charles Evelyn!</P>
<P>We are no longer rivals now, Nancy, but &s;incere friends; I will therefore ho|ne&s;tly confe&s;s to you, that I have borne the &s;tronge&s;t hatred to Lady Juliana, from the moment that ideot Evelyn fell in love with her; not that I loved him, but I would have married him, for he is immen&s;ely rich: and yet I know not whether Lady Juliana was the &s;ole cau&s;e of my di&s;appointment.&mdash;I was weak enough to quarrel with him about a wretched pro&s;titute, for &s;uch I am &s;ure

it is not in my power to prevent a man's being in love with one, if he chu&s;es it, tho' I could almo&s;t wi&s;h that the party did not &s;hew his attachment &s;o openly.</P>

<HEAD>LADY O'SHAUGHNASY TO MADAME DUPONT.</HEAD>
<P>THANKS to you, my dear Du|pont, for your congratulations; they ar|rived mo&s;t critically upon my wedding-day&mdash;My dear baronet was &s;o extremely pre&s;&s;ing, that I found it impo&s;&s;ible to re|&s;i&s;t, and gave him my hand la&s;t Thur&s;|day.&mdash;His fondne&s;s is quite romantic; he would not wait for &s;ettlements, but has a&s;&s;ured me that I &s;hall have an un|limited power over my own fortune, and that he will endow me with a noble
<PB N="101" REF="103">
jointure.&mdash;The Iri&s;h are all generous, but I think my &s;pou&s;e rather too much &s;o.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harri&s;on, who is I believe bur&s;t|ing with envy, &s;aid every thing in her power to prevail on me to defer my mar|riage till her brother's arrival in town; I am certain &s;he had &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter view in wi&s;hing to delay my happine&s;s, and yet I cannot gue&s;s what it could be, for it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he could be vain enough to think of inveigling Sir John. No matter what her &s;chemes were, I have put it out of her power to do me any injury.</P>
<P>I have not yet &s;een any of my hu&s;|band's relations; they are all in the country, and indeed there are few people of quality in Dublin at pre&s;ent.&mdash;I am impatient till we go to our ca&s;tle; tho' Sir John &s;ays it is a good deal out of re|pair, and therefore he &s;eems inclined to
<PB N="102" REF="104">
purcha&s;e a &s;mall &s;eat within a few miles of town; but I love the grandeur of an ancient family-man&s;ion, and have no doubt but he will indulge my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I am at pre&s;ent &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by my own happine&s;s, that I have hardly lei&s;ure to rejoice in Lady Juliana's mi&s;|fortunes; yet I am &s;incerely glad &s;he is bani&s;hed, and to the &s;pot &s;he hates, to Harley-hill.&mdash;I give you infinite credit for having brought about a breach be|tween her and her brother; that brother whom &s;he u&s;ed to boa&s;t of as being all perfection. But &s;he was always in&s;uf|ferably vain of the merits of her family, and u&s;ed to talk of her mother as if &s;he had been a phoenix; tho' I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was neither better nor wor&s;e than your's or mine, except her being a counte&s;s.</P>
<P>Apropos of your mother; I &s;hall look for a proper place for her among&s;t our

<P>That viper Evelyn is expected in town next week: I will &s;et out for our &s;eat before he comes&mdash;for, O my dear Dupont, I feel I cannot bear his &s;ight! My baronet, tho' tall and hand&s;ome, would be annihilated in his pre&s;ence; for tho' both you and I dete&s;t him, we mu&s;t acknowledge he is charming, in his fi|gure at lea&s;t. His fooli&s;h companion, Captain Harri&s;on, is returning to Eng|land to marry the widow of a man who was killed in a &s;trange way at Evelyn's lodgings at Bath; but, thank my &s;tars, I have done with the whole &s;et; for I don't intend to vi&s;it Mi&s;s Harri&s;on when I come to town next winter.</P>

For heaven's &s;ake, my dear Dupont, take care of your&s;elf, and don't be caught tripping, unle&s;s you are &s;ure of a divorce, and even then you know Sir James De&s;mond can't marry you, unle&s;s you could contrive to detect his &s;aint-like dame at a retaliation, which I be|lieve to be impo&s;&s;ible; for &s;he has not &s;pirit enough for a frolic, unle&s;s &s;he is mightily altered &s;ince I knew her; &s;he was then called the gentle Emma, and I think can never ri&s;e higher than tago's prai&s;e&mdash;"To &s;uckle fools, and chronicle &s;mall beer."

<HEAD>SIR WILLIAM STANLEY TO MR. EVELYN.</HEAD>
<P>DEAR Evelyn, the hurry of bu&s;i|ne&s;s I have been engaged in &s;ince my return to town, will, I hope, be a &s;uf|ficient excu&s;e for not having &s;ooner ac|knowledged the plea&s;ure I received from both your letters.&mdash;The fir&s;t has in&s;pired me with an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee the beautiful lake, which you mode&s;tly&s;ay you cannot de&s;cribe; though you have contrived to give Lucy and me &s;uch an idea of it, that we have both re&s;olved,
<PB N="106" REF="108">
provided you will accompany us, to vi&s;it Killarney next &s;ummer; and when we are &s;afe landed on the Iri&s;h &s;hore, we &s;hall al&s;o expect you will do us the ho|nour of pre&s;enting us to his Royal High|ne&s;s of Coolavin, and all the noble per|&s;onages of his family.</P>
<P>If the old &s;avage, as you ju&s;tly call him, &s;hould have retired into his coffin before our arrival, I &s;hall hope to be in|dulged with a &s;ight of his &s;pou&s;e, of whom I have formed &s;o venerable an idea, that I would travel &s;ome hundreds of miles to have the honour of ki&s;&s;ing her fair hand, and addre&s;&s;ing her with that re&s;pect which is due, not to her hu&s;band's mock royalty, but to her &s;ex and age.</P>
<P>Had I met with the relation, you have given of this extraordinary family, in a book of travels, or, as it is now more po|litely
<PB N="107" REF="109">
&s;tyled, a Tour through Ireland, I &s;hould have thought the author a bad chronologer, and that he had &s;tept back at lea&s;t a couple of centuries, in order to characteri&s;e the national weakne&s;s of the Iri&s;h, that of uniting pride with poverty.&mdash;Your veracity, however, is &s;ufficient to prove, that even in this en|lightened age it &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in a &s;uperla|tive degree among&s;t the illu&s;trious inha|bitants of Coolavin.</P>
<P>I was much plea&s;ed with your account of the blind bard; I wi&s;h you under&s;tood his language; who knows but he may be a &s;econd Homer! and might &s;ing the prowe&s;s of the progenitors of the O'Dermots, in as lofty &s;trains as the Grecian poet be&s;towed upon that of Achilles and Agamemnon.&mdash;Be that as it may, I am per&s;uaded that tho&s;e ditties, which are framed in honour of their ance&s;tors, &s;erve to inflame the
<PB N="108" REF="110">
pride of the de&s;cendants, and make them prefer indigence, in a genteel profe&s;&s;ion, to affluence in a meaner rank of life.&mdash;This may appear from the de&s;ti|nation of the younger &s;ons, who are devoted to poverty, and can never be of u&s;e to their country.&mdash;I heartily pity their mi&s;guided youth, and think it amazing how &s;uch a family of gentle|men, even in the cheape&s;t country, can be provided with food and raiment out of &s;o &s;mall an income as two hundred pounds a year!</P>
<P>I have purpo&s;ely deferred mentioning the mo&s;t material &s;ubject of your letter, the unhappine&s;s of Lady De&s;mond, be|cau&s;e I am by no means certain of the cau&s;e.&mdash;A trifling circum&s;tance has con|vinced me that it does not ari&s;e from any pecuniary difficulty; nay, I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e Sir James De&s;mond mu&s;t be rather in affluence, though I hate go&s;|&s;iping,
<PB N="109" REF="111">
I think you have a right to be informed even of this trivial matter, le&s;t you &s;hould think me tardy in the execu|tion of your generous intentions towards our dear Emma. As I have received a very con&s;iderable addition to my fortune, by the death of my grandfather, I meant to &s;urpri&s;e my Lucy, by pre&s;enting her with a &s;et of jewels which &s;hould corre&s;pond with the ear-rings you gave her, and called upon Bellis in Pall-Mall to be|&s;peak them.&mdash;He &s;hewed me many beautiful ornaments, and among&s;t the re&s;t a diamond &s;prig for a lady's hair, that was both rich and elegant. I en|quired the price, which he told me was four hundred guineas. I would have paid for it directly, but he would not part with it, as he &s;aid it was be|&s;poke by Sir James De&s;mond, whom he expected to call for it every moment, as he had expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t impatience
<PB N="110" REF="112">
to have it fini&s;hed.&mdash;I immediately di|rected another to be made exactly like it, and felt my&s;elf extremely plea&s;ed with the information I had received, upon a double account, both with re|gard to the &s;tate of Sir James's finances and his affections.</P>
<P>Luckily I did not mention this matter to Lucy, as I meant to keep my tran&s;|action with Bellis a &s;ecret till my de&s;ign was complete. In the evening I pro|po&s;ed our going to Sir James De&s;mond's, Lucy, with her u&s;ual conde&s;cen&s;ion, complied, yet I could perceive a &s;ome|thing more like reluctance, in her man|ner of a&s;&s;enting, than I had ever before ob&s;erved to any reque&s;t of mine.</P>
<P>When we came into Lady De&s;mond's drawing-room, we found her embroider|ing a wai&s;tcoat for Sir James, their little Fanny playing by her &s;ide.&mdash;At a card|table
<PB N="111" REF="113">
were placed Sir Jame, your friend Sewell, two other men, and Madame Dupont mo&s;t elegantly dre&s;&s;ed; the finery of her whole appearance attracted my eyes, which were &s;oon fixed by &s;ur|prize on the identical diamond &s;prig, I had &s;een at Bellis's in the morning, con|&s;picuous among&s;t the other ornaments of her hair. I looked &s;o long and &s;teadily at her head-dre&s;s, that I fancied &s;he be|came confu&s;ed; but as &s;he is not ea&s;ily put out of countenance, my own di&s;|agreeable &s;en&s;ations upon this &s;ubject might probably occa&s;ion my thinking &s;o.</P>
<P>Sir James, who is always polite, pre&s;&s;ed us to join their party at loo, and the galant Mr. Sewel offered to re&s;ign his place at the table either to Lucy or me.&mdash;We declined their civilities, and &s;at about an hour conver&s;ing with Emma, who appeared more chearful than I have &s;een her for &s;ome time pa&s;t, yet &s;till an
<PB N="112" REF="114">
air of melancholy dwelt on her lovely face, and like a &s;ummer cloud, &s;lightly ob&s;cured the lu&s;tre of the &s;un.&mdash;While I turned my eyes alternately upon Lady De&s;mond and Madame Dupont, I was ready to exclaim with Hamlet,
<Q><L>Could'&s;t thou on this fair mountain</L>
<L>Leave to feed, and batten on that moor?</L></Q>
But granting this affair as bad as I ap|prehend, we mu&s;t leave it to time to cure.&mdash;Men will not be &s;chooled out of their vices, and corro&s;ives but inflame wounds.&mdash;All that can now be done is to guard the infamous &s;ecret from Emma, the only means of doing which is to get her as much out of the &s;candalous &s;et, where &s;he is only a cy|pher, as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;This thought imme|diately occurring to me, I propo&s;ed her going to the opera with Lucy and me to-morrow evening; &s;he did not venture to reply to my propo&s;al, but turned her
<PB N="113" REF="115">
dove-like eyes upon her hu&s;band, as if to &s;olicit his con&s;ent, which, to do him ju&s;tice, he very graciou&s;ly gave, adding, that he was extremely &s;orry a prior en|gagement mu&s;t prevent him from being of our party.&mdash;He is neither a fool nor a brute, we may therefore have hopes of his reformation.</P>
<P>Remember, my dear Charles, that all I have &s;aid of Sir James and Madame Dupont, is founded merely on conjec|ture; &s;he may have employed him to purcha&s;e this jewel for her, and it would be cruel to rob her of the <Q>immediate jewel of her &s;oul,</Q> upon a &s;light &s;urmi&s;e.</P>
<P>The more I reflect upon this affair, the more plea&s;ed I am at your ab&s;ence.&mdash;The warmth of your nature would not &s;uffer you to wait till time &s;hall unravel this my&s;tery; you would precipitately
<PB N="114" REF="116">
call for an explanation of your doubts, and by &s;o doing, injure the very per&s;on whom you wi&s;h to &s;erve.</P>
<P>The idea of my&s;tery recals Lady Ju|liana Harley to my mind.&mdash;It is above &s;ix weeks &s;ince &s;he left her brother's hou&s;e at Richmond; neither Lucy, nor any other per&s;on, except old Wat&s;on, her &s;teward, has heard from her &s;ince.&mdash;He, it &s;eems, has received her orders to di&s;po&s;e of her hou&s;e and furniture in Berkeley-&s;quare. Upon being que&s;|tioned, he told me his Lady was not at Harley-hill; but he either does not know; or will not tell, where &s;he is.</P>
<P>Lucy is incon&s;olable about her; &s;he fears &s;ome accident has befallen her, and is hourly making fruitle&s;s enquiries after her friend.&mdash;I confe&s;s there is &s;ome|thing very extraordinary in her conduct; time only can tell us more than we
<PB N="115" REF="117">
know already, which is, that &s;he is amiable and unhappy.</P>
<P>Since we are upon the &s;ubject of pri|vate hi&s;tory, I &s;hould be glad to know what Mi&s;s Harley is doing in Ireland, and whether &s;he has yet made any im|pre&s;&s;ion on your obdurate heart? but if &s;he has failed, I &s;hould hope that either Mi&s;s Harri&s;on, or &s;ome other of her fair countrywomen, have been more &s;ucce&s;s|ful.</P>

<HEAD>CHARLES EVELYN TO SIR WILLIAM STANLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BELIEVE me, Stanley, I mo&s;t &s;incerely rejoice in every acqui&s;ition of wealth and honour that can accrue to you and my loved Lucy, to whom I mu&s;t intreat you to make my apology for not an&s;wering her letter; as the con|tents of your's have &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;ed my thoughts, that I cannot direct them to any other objects but the dear &s;uffer|ing ones, of my tendere&s;t affection.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120">
My &s;i&s;ter Selwyn and Lucy will, I hope, forgive me, when I own, that even from my boyi&s;h days, Emma has been the darling of my fondne&s;s: but had I never known a partial regard for her till the pre&s;ent time, I &s;hould have felt it now.&mdash;She is unhappy!&mdash;Thank heaven! my other &s;i&s;ters are not &s;o.</P>
<P>Lady Juliana too&mdash;where can &s;he be fled! wherefore &s;hould &s;he fly! or why conceal the place of her retreat from her loved friend, your wife!</P>
<P>Sir James De&s;mond is&mdash;what I have ever thought him. I will allow that our affections are not always in our power, they may change from the mo&s;t charm|ing to the mo&s;t odious object; but a man of honour will not add in&s;ult to injury, and triumph over the heart that he has wronged.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="121">
I think with you that violent means will not recall a wandering affection, and &s;ure I am that Emma's gentle &s;pirit will &s;uffer all her hu&s;band can inflict in &s;ilent &s;adne&s;s; &s;he will not reproach him, nor wound his ears with her complainings; her tears will flow in &s;ecret, their traces may perhaps be &s;een on her pale cheek, and by her hu&s;band's con&s;cious heart, they may be deemed upbraidings.</P>
<P>It is extremely fortunate that I am not in London; I could not with pa|tience have endured the &s;cene you &s;aw at Sir James De&s;mond's&mdash;How dare he bring his paramour into the pre&s;ence of his wife? 'Tis pa&s;t conjecture, Stanley; I have no doubts of their infamous con|nection. You &s;ay he is neither a fool nor brute, and therefore we may hope for his reformation&mdash;that is, when his vi|tiated ta&s;te grows &s;ick and weary of his pre&s;ent folly, he will behave le&s;s cruelly
<PB N="120" REF="122">
to his wife, from con&s;cious &s;hame of hav|ing u&s;ed her ill. But can the heart re|turn when once e&s;tranged? can &s;he have that unbounded confidence in his affec|tion, which con&s;titutes the charm of wedded love? Will &s;he not fear a &s;econd change of his affection, and can &s;he look with fond re&s;pect upon the man who has taught her to think &s;lightly of him? Im|po&s;&s;ible! The human heart was formed to feel, and when oppre&s;&s;ed by unmerited &s;ufferings, it will re&s;ent. Time's lenient power will no doubt abate the keen an|gui&s;h of di&s;appointed love&mdash;Its cure at length is found in cold indifference, and &s;he who had a right to hope for happi|ne&s;s, gladly compounds for ea&s;e. Such is the &s;tate of many a female heart; no wonder then if it &s;hould &s;ometimes &s;tray, and when rejected by its lawful lord, &s;eek con&s;olation in an alien's brea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123">
I have no fears of this kind for our Emma; &s;he will, as I have already &s;aid, too tamely acquie&s;ce in her hard fate. But here I &s;wear &s;he &s;hall not be in&s;ulted&mdash;Madame Dupont &s;hall be bani&s;hed from Sir James De&s;mond's hou&s;e; their &s;cenes of galantry be played el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>This is a point on which I intreat Lucy to interfere&mdash;It may not be &s;o proper for you to appear in &s;uch a mat|ter&mdash;Depend upon it, Emma is perfectly acquainted with her hu&s;band's folly; her &s;i&s;ter therefore may &s;peak freely to her, and I intreat &s;he will.</P>
<P>There &s;urely mu&s;t be &s;ome cau&s;e for Lady Juliana's conduct&mdash;Why is it made a my&s;tery to me? My tendere&s;t wi&s;hes for her happine&s;s accompany her flight, and ever &s;hall attend her&mdash;But yet I am not weak enough to form a thought of pur&s;uing her, nor would I ob|trude
<PB N="122" REF="124">
my&s;elf into her pre&s;ence, were it this moment in my power to do &s;o&mdash;Then do not keep me longer in the dark, but freely tell me all you know about her.</P>
<P>That very &s;illy woman, that was Mi&s;s Harley, has married a man who calls him&s;elf Sir John O'Shaughna&s;y; but from all the accounts that I can learn, he is a &s;elf-created baronet, and equally deficient in manners, morals, rank, and fortune. She has not been acquainted with him above a month. Mi&s;s Har|ri&s;on u&s;ed every argument in her power to delay the marriage till her brother re|turned to Dublin, in order that he &s;hould make &s;ome inquiries into the man's character; but the lovers were im|patient, and married they were. They left this town on the morning of the day that Captain Harri&s;on and I returned to it; they &s;et out, with a very pompous
<PB N="123" REF="125">
equipage, to a water-drinking place called Mallow, and no per&s;on has heard from them &s;ince. I hope the hu&s;band is not &s;o bad as he is repre&s;ented; for tho' I di&s;like, I bear no malice to her mock-lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>No, Stanley! neither Mi&s;s Harri&s;on, nor any other woman I have &s;een in this kingdom, has made any impre&s;&s;ion on my heart; tho' I acknowledge I have be|held much beauty here, and that the lady I have named has charms &s;ufficient, both of mind and per&s;on, to in&s;pire the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ion in a vacant heart; but mine is filled with one adored idea, and never &s;hall another enter there&mdash;I wi&s;h not to renew the painful &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Let your next letter be directed to Bath, where I hope to hear that my loved Emma is at lea&s;t &s;et free from the mortifying triumph of her dete&s;ted rival;
<PB N="124" REF="126">
and al&s;o, what part of the world Lady Juliana has retired to. Love to my &s;i&s;ters. I think I would not have Emma know that I am acquainted with her pre|&s;ent &s;ituation; her delicacy will be wounded at knowing that I mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e her worthle&s;s hu&s;band. Adieu,</P>

<P>DO not imagine, my dear Lucy, that I have not fully &s;hared the anxiety you mu&s;t have &s;uffered from my unac|counted-for ab&s;ence. Thank heaven, this is the only time I have ever witting|ly given you pain &s;ince the fir&s;t happy days we &s;pent together in youthful inno|cence&mdash;Ah, why do I recall the fond remembrances?</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128">
I have heard it &s;aid that at the ap|proach of death we become in&s;en&s;ibly weaned from our deare&s;t connections, the fibres of the heart grow relaxed, and tho&s;e dear ties, which were &s;o clo&s;ely wound about it, loo&s;en and decay, &s;o as to make us willingly re&s;ign what we can no longer retain.&mdash;How highly favour|able mu&s;t &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation be to the &s;ons and daughters of &s;en&s;ibility! But why may not a living wretch partake of this indulgence? why mu&s;t the ab&s;ent forms of tho&s;e from whom &s;he is bani&s;h|ed haunt her retirement, obtrude into her &s;olitary cell, and &s;kim along before her la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">guid eyes.</P>
<P>Why do I &s;till behold my Lucy's face, &s;ee the bright drop &s;tand trembling in her eye, or &s;ilent &s;teal along her blooming cheek, drawn forth by pity for her Juli|ana? Why does my brother's form ap|pear
<PB N="127" REF="129">
before me? why does contempt &s;hoot from his angry eyes even through my &s;inking heart? But I have other vi|&s;ions &s;till more dreadful&mdash;&s;pectres, in|deed, that have long &s;tampt indelible im|pre&s;&s;ions on my heart and mind.</P>
<P>Would I could tell you all&mdash;but &s;oon I will&mdash;This bur&s;ting bo&s;om &s;hall have vent, and pour forth all its &s;orrows into yours.&mdash;A &s;ad and cruel proof of friend|&s;hip! yet when you know how dearly it mu&s;t co&s;t me, my Lucy will e&s;teem it as &s;he ought.</P>
<P>Judge, by your own feelings, what I mu&s;t have &s;uffered at tearing my&s;elf from you, without informing you of my in|tentions&mdash;Too well I knew that you would plead again&s;t my purpo&s;e, and I al&s;o knew, that even you mu&s;t plead in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130">
Deprived of the only &s;tay in life, that fate had left me, my unkind brother! on whom could I rely for comfort or protec|tion? A little twig, bending beneath the bla&s;t, without one fo&s;tering tree to &s;helter or &s;upport it.&mdash;I have at length e&s;caped the &s;torm, and never, never will I brave it more.</P>
<P>My rank and connections in life, un|happily for me, placed me in &s;uch a &s;itu|ation, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to in|dulge my &s;incere wi&s;h of living in retire|ment whil&s;t I remained in England. I was by many mi&s;taken for an object of envy, and malice pur&s;ued my &s;teps, tho' their traces were marked by &s;orrow&mdash;What then have I to regret in the world I have left? ought I not rather to rejoice in the idea of being forgotten by every acquaintance, and by every friend, except your&s;elf, who ever knew or loved me?</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131">
The pains I have taken to conceal, even from you, the place of my retire|ment, mu&s;t convince you that my re&s;o|lution is not to be &s;haken&mdash;But though determined on an entire &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, I &s;till wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the ten|der attachment that has &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, and which is now the &s;ole remaining charm that can render life &s;upportable to me; you may therefore conclude that I de&s;ire to hear frequently from you; for when we &s;ay we wi&s;h to be forgotten by the whole univer&s;e, there is &s;till one tender bo&s;om where we would repo&s;e, one dear and faithful friend, in who&s;e memory we de&s;ire even to &s;urvive our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I did not bring a &s;ingle &s;ervant with me from England&mdash;I have &s;ettled Wat|&s;on, who was &s;o many years my maid, with her father at Canterbury&mdash;The old
<PB N="130" REF="132">
man was my father's &s;teward, and &s;till is mine; his long and faithful &s;ervices amply de&s;erve the independence which he now enjoys. If I were capable of ta&s;ting plea&s;ure, I &s;hould feel it, from the recollection of having rendered a very worthy family happy.</P>
<P>Wat&s;on is the only per&s;on to whom I have confided the place of my retreat; you mu&s;t inclo&s;e your letters to him, and he will forward them to me.&mdash;You &s;ee how &s;trongly I rely upon your friend|&s;hip&mdash;I cannot fear that I &s;hall ever be neglected or forgotten by your tender|ne&s;s and virtue.</P>
<P>When I write next, I hope I &s;hall be more compo&s;ed.&mdash;Peace has began to dawn upon me &s;ince the determination of my purpo&s;e, and may perhaps again revi&s;it my &s;ad heart&mdash;Soon &s;hall its faults

<HEAD>LADY STANLEY TO LADY JULIANA.</HEAD>
<P>HOW have I trembled for the life, or what is dearer &s;till, the rea&s;on, of my beloved Juliana; and though your letter has relieved my fears on the fir&s;t &s;ubject, you mu&s;t pardon my &s;aying that I am not yet at peace upon the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Say, my unkind my&s;terious friend, what are tho&s;e cruel ills your youth has &s;uffered, that have determined you to
<PB N="133" REF="135">
quit a world you &s;carce have entered? Ble&s;t as you are with every outward &s;ign of happine&s;s, with beauty, rank, and for|tune, what are tho&s;e &s;ecret pangs that prey upon your heart? A life of inno|cence &s;hould be a life of peace; and &s;ure I am my Juliana knows no guilt.</P>
<P>The only misfortune that has ever at|tended you was the death of Mr. Har|ley, or perhaps, I might rather &s;ay, your marriage with him. But tho&s;e events are pa&s;&s;ed long &s;ince; and had you loved your hu&s;band with the tendere&s;t fondne&s;s, time would ere now have &s;oftened your di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;The youthful eye bends not its &s;peculation always on the grave&mdash;Yours &s;hould look forward to long &s;miling &s;cenes of happine&s;s that wait you&mdash;Such &s;hould your vi&s;ions be, becau&s;e you have a right to hope they would be realized.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">
I cannot think &s;o &s;lightly of your un|der&s;tanding, as to &s;uppo&s;e your quarrel with your brother &s;hould di&s;gu&s;t you with all the re&s;t of the world.&mdash;Indeed, Juliana, you want not his &s;upport, but you want firmne&s;s to &s;upport your&s;elf&mdash;The little tittle-tattle relative to my bro|ther mu&s;t have quickly blown over&mdash;You have &s;unk beneath a whi&s;per, not a &s;torm.</P>
<P>Return, my friend, return, and face your foes; they will vani&s;h at your pre|&s;ence, their malice &s;hall recoil upon them&s;elves, and your fair fame appear more bright from their attempts to &s;ully it. Flight is always con&s;trued into a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt; there is no retreating from &s;lander; we mu&s;t confront the <HI>blatant bea&s;t,</HI> or never hope to quell it.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf this hint will have due weight with you, and make you reflect
<PB N="135" REF="137">
that you ought not to let your enemies triumph over you, for the &s;ake of your friends, your family, and your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am firmly per&s;uaded that a great part of your unhappine&s;s is con&s;titutional, and proceeds from the weakne&s;s of your nerves; and hence ari&s;e tho&s;e &s;pectres that you &s;ay haunt your retirement: they are fancy-bred, Juliana, and would quickly vani&s;h in the di&s;&s;ipation of the gay world&mdash;'Tis only in the gloom of &s;olitude they ever dwell&mdash;Do not then mortify me, by preferring &s;uch horrid company to mine.</P>
<P>I believe it is near a dozen years &s;ince we were fir&s;t acquainted, and during that whole time have I been &s;triving to en|liven your &s;pirits; for you have been ad|dicted to melancholy, even from your childhood, and of all per&s;ons breathing
<PB N="136" REF="138">
are the mo&s;t unfit for &s;olitude&mdash;There may be truth in a paradox.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not comment upon the unkind|ne&s;s of concealing your de&s;ign of quit|ting England from me, nor on the childi&s;hne&s;s of your continuing to make a my&s;tery of the place of your retirement. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that whatever other proofs of your friend&s;hip you may think proper to honour me with, I &s;hall &s;till think it deficient, if I am to be kept in the dark with regard to your pre&s;ent &s;ituation; for I think you know me well enough to be certain that I can keep a &s;ecret.&mdash;My de&s;ire to be informed of this particular, ari&s;es from an higher mo|tive than curio&s;ity; for that alone might well be &s;atisfied with the unbounded confidence you have promi&s;ed to repo&s;e in me.&mdash;But, indeed, my dear vi&s;ionary, I think you can have no &s;ecrets that I do not know.&mdash;Perhaps I am mi&s;taken,

<P>I AM truly grateful to my dear Lucy, for her kind attention to my happine&s;s, which has received a con&s;i|derable increa&s;e from the plea&s;ing ac|counts in her letter.</P>
<P>I am, indeed, &s;incerely rejoiced to hear of Lady Juliana's &s;afety, though I own our apprehen&s;ions on her account could have no foundation, but that of

uncommon and &s;ini&s;ter accidents, for &s;urely there does not exi&s;t a &s;avage, in the wilde&s;t part of the univer&s;e, that would injure her.</P>
<P>I am &s;till extremely perplexed by her conduct, in concealing her retreat from you.&mdash;It is not from me that &s;he now flies; my word has ever been inviolable, nor for my own &s;ake would I renew the pangs I have already &s;uffered, by hazarding another interview.</P>
<P>I am highly plea&s;ed with your re&s;o|lution of endeavouring to bring her back to England. What cau&s;e can &s;he po&s;&s;i|bly have to &s;hun a world that mu&s;t adore her? I am lo&s;t in the conjecture.</P>
<P>Our Emma too, you tell me, is more chearful&mdash;plea&s;ing intelligence! never may gloom again oppre&s;s her gentle &s;pirits, or &s;adne&s;s cloud the &s;weet &s;ere|nity

<OPENER><DATELINE>Mallow.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>RUINED and undone, Maria! deceived, &s;tript, and de&s;erted! Can you believe there was ever &s;uch a mon&s;ter in nature as this beggarly baronet, that has impo&s;ed on me? I &s;hall keep my title, for a knight he &s;urely is, of &s;ome foreign order or other; but the being &s;tiled your Lady&s;hip is all I have got for twenty thou&s;and pounds; luckily for me there is a rever&s;ionary heir to the
<PB N="150" REF="152">
other ten, and I could not be&s;tow it on my vile hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I will be calm if I can, and acquaint you with the whole proce&s;s of his vil|lainy.&mdash;He brought me to this place under pretence that his ca&s;tle (one in the air) was in this county, and that he could have frequent opportunities of &s;eeing how the workmen went on with the re|pairs, by making &s;hort excur&s;ions from hence.</P>
<P>When I had been here about a week, I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize at not having received the u&s;ual compliments of vi&s;its, &amp;c. from his family: he told me that mo&s;t of them lived at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, but he would take care they &s;hould not be wanting in re&s;pect to me, and he would &s;et out next day to ac|quaint them with my arrival in the coun|try.&mdash;He took the carriage with him,
<PB N="151" REF="153">
and returned in two days, accompanied by a couple of the &s;trange&s;t female frights I ever beheld; the one old and ugly, the other young and rather hand|&s;ome. The&s;e vulgar figures he intro|duced to me as an aunt and cou&s;in; I received them civilly, but the &s;ight of the&s;e quite cured me of my impatience to be acquainted with the re&s;t of his kindred.</P>
<P>The&s;e women got their per&s;ons and dre&s;s a little new modelled in a few days, and one evening we went to the rooms together, for this, you mu&s;t know, is a water-drinking place.&mdash;I had &s;at down to cards with &s;ome ladies of fa&s;hion here, when my cou&s;in Catty, came to the table, and whi&s;pered me that Sir John had &s;ent to de&s;ire I would let him have my keys for a few minutes, as he wanted &s;ome paper out of my writing-box;
<PB N="152" REF="154">
&s;he &s;aid &s;he would carry them to him and return immediately.</P>
<P>I complied without he&s;itation, and more than an hour elap&s;ed before I grew unea&s;y at not &s;eeing Sir John or his young kin&s;woman.&mdash;The old one, who &s;tuck clo&s;e to my &s;ide, &s;aid &s;he believed Sir John and Catty were gone to vi&s;it a relation of theirs that lived about three miles off, for &s;he had &s;een them drive by in the chariot.</P>
<P>Though I was by no means delighted with this intelligence, I concealed my chagrin, and waited in expectation of their &s;ending the carriage for me, as it happened to rain, till every creature had left the rooms. But, had I &s;taid till it came, I might have remained there for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="155">
When I returned to my lodgings, I found the doors of my apartment locked, and, upon enquiring for the &s;er|vants, I was told the men were all gone with Sir John and the young Lady, and they believed my woman was in the bed|chamber, as they had heard an odd noi&s;e in that part of the hou&s;e.&mdash;I called to my maid &s;everal times but received no an&s;wer, and upon having the doors forced open, I found her locked up in a dark clo&s;et, where &s;he could &s;carcely breathe, and from whence it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he could be heard or convey me any intelligence.</P>
<P>My trunks were all lying open, my papers, jewels, money, and the be&s;t part of my wardrobe vani&s;hed.&mdash;I be|came almo&s;t di&s;tracted.&mdash;The old Jeza|bel of an aunt either was, or pretended to be, ten times more outrageous than me.&mdash;She tore her hair, and uttered a
<PB N="154" REF="156">
thou&s;and imprecations again&s;t Sir John, with whom, in her fury, &s;he di&s;claimed all relation&s;hip.&mdash;But I found the great &s;ource of her &s;orrow was the being left behind by her hopeful daughter.</P>
<P>In this dreadful exigence I knew not how to act, but as &s;oon as I was a little calm, I applied to a gentleman of the law for advice, he a&s;&s;ured me there was nothing to be done for my &s;ervice, as my hu&s;band had a legal claim to all my effects.&mdash;I fancied that even this grave &s;age of the law, and all the people about me, &s;eemed rather to laugh at my di&s;|tre&s;s than pity it, 'till I informed them that I was &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ten thou&s;and pounds, which happily it was not in my hu&s;band's power to alienate. They then changed their manners towards me, and the coun&s;ellor would fain have per&s;uaded me to in&s;titute a &s;uit in the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal court again&s;t Sir John.&mdash;I &s;hall not
<PB N="155" REF="157">
take his advice, but mean to return immediately to England, and try what better information I can pick up there.</P>
<P>O, Maria, what vile hypocrites are the&s;e men! would to heaven I had re|mained &s;ingle! and yet it was impo&s;&s;ible to doubt the apparent fondne&s;s of this cruel wretch, who &s;eemed perfectly to doat on me; and I am &s;uch a fool, I cannot help lamenting the lo&s;s of his tenderne&s;s. It mu&s;t have been that cur&s;ed Catty that &s;educed him from me. How will my prudi&s;h &s;i&s;ter-in-law, and all the other puritans of my acquaint|ance, laugh at my being taken in at this time of my life? I cannot bear the thought.&mdash;I think I had better retire into &s;ome place where I am not known, than expo&s;e my&s;elf to the ridicule of tho&s;e, who pretend to &s;tile them&s;elves my friends.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158">
No, I will pur&s;ue my hu&s;band; per|haps I may yet recover his affections or my effects, and get him to di&s;card his infamous accomplice.&mdash;If you had &s;een how hand&s;ome he looked the very day he left me, you could not have be|lieved him a deceiver.</P>

<P>P. S. To any one but my Lucy, the enclo&s;ed narrative would afford little entertainment; it is not a &s;eries of events, but a continued conflict of the mind, and is a hi&s;tory of pa&s;&s;ions, not of per|&s;ons.</P>

<HEAD>STORY OF LADY JULIANA HARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>Though my loved Lucy is al|already acquainted with all the little events of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed days we pa&s;&s;ed in youthful innocence together, and that I have already informed you of the cau&s;e of the &s;eparation that took place between my parents while I was a child, you mu&s;t allow me to recur back again to that fatal circum&s;tance, from which I have cau&s;e to date my every mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>My mother, as you know, died at Dijon, a real martyr to the Catholic re|ligion, which &s;he profe&s;&s;ed&mdash;To that &s;he &s;acrificed all earthly ties; the tender wife and the fond mother &s;unk before the idea of a higher duty; the conflict was too great for her &s;oft nature&mdash;<Q>The &s;aint &s;u&s;tained it, but the woman died.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164">
When the period of all her &s;orrows drew near, &s;he called me to her, and with her dying lips enjoined me to pay the &s;tricte&s;t obedience to my father in every point, except that of renouncing the religion in which I had been bred, and which, &s;he added, I tru&s;t my Julia will never for&s;ake; for &s;omething tells me, that you may, at &s;ome time or other of your life, &s;tand in need of &s;uch an a&s;ylum as can only be found in the bo&s;om of our church.</P>
<P>Too prophetic were her words, but ever ble&s;t be the guardian &s;pirit that in|&s;pired them! The deep melancholy which &s;ucceeded to the violent &s;orrow I felt for the lo&s;s of &s;uch a parent, marked my countenance with a timid and deject|ed air, which my father, at my return to England, unkindly mi&s;con&s;trued into a &s;ullenne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, or a per&s;onal di&s;like to him, and this opinion in&s;pired
<PB N="163" REF="165">
an haughty coldne&s;s in his manners to|wards me&mdash;I trembled whenever I ap|proached him; his hand was not &s;tretched forth to &s;u&s;tain my feeble &s;teps, nor did the encouraging &s;mile of pa|rental fondne&s;s ever &s;mooth the &s;everity of his naturally au&s;tere brow.&mdash;My bro|ther was his darling, and my only con&s;o|lation&mdash;Cruel as he is now become, my heart avows its gratitude to him for all the little happine&s;s that dawned upon my youth.</P>
<P>When I had been about a year at my father's, he propo&s;ed &s;ending back the governe&s;s that had come with me from France, as he ju&s;tly imagined that &s;he kept up my attachment to the Catholic religion, which he was determined I &s;hould renounce. This was a &s;evere &s;troke to me; I loved Madame Duval as a &s;econd parent; &s;he had been a fa|vourite of my mother's, and many plea&s;|ing
<PB N="164" REF="166">
melancholy hours we u&s;ed to &s;pend together, in mingling our tears to her memory.&mdash;On this occa&s;ion her dying commands occurred to me, and I &s;ub|mitted without appearing to lament my lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Her place was &s;upplied by a very dif|ferent &s;ort of woman, unplea&s;ing in her per&s;on, and vulgar in her manners&mdash;But you mu&s;t remember Mrs. Winterman&mdash;I conceived a very &s;trong aver&s;ion to her from the fir&s;t &s;ight; and therefore from the moment that my poor Duval left me, I never had a female friend older than my&s;elf whom I could con&s;ult upon any difficult occa&s;ion, or to whom I could pour forth the &s;orrows of my o'er-burthened heart.</P>
<P>About this aera I had the happine&s;s of becoming acquainted with you; the vi|cinity of our hou&s;es in the country pro|duced
<PB N="165" REF="167">
an intimacy between our families, and &s;oon, very &s;oon, my Lucy became the adopted &s;i&s;ter of my love.&mdash;About two years after our friend&s;hip had com|menced, my brother went to travel; my father, who could ill bear his ab&s;ence, determined to vi&s;it his e&s;tates in Scot|land, and leave me with Mrs. Winter|man and the &s;ervants at home.&mdash;I know my Lucy's kindne&s;s then prevailed on Mrs. Evelyn to reque&s;t my father that I might be permitted to pa&s;s the winter with her in London&mdash;His con&s;ent to this propo&s;al was the only mark of his affec|tion I ever had received.&mdash;Wou'd to heaven he had been obdurate, as he was wont to be, and confined me at Fairfield: yet let me not unju&s;tly charge him with the &s;ad effects that &s;prung from this in|dulgence&mdash;The faults are all my own, the merit his.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="168">
About the beginning of the following &s;pring, you may remember that your elde&s;t brother returned to England on account of your mother's ill health, though he had not fini&s;hed his travels, nor been abroad above three years.</P>
<P>O Lucy, do you recollect his form? Alas! to me it is for ever pre&s;ent. He had &s;uch eyes as yours, and Emma's gra|cious &s;mile&mdash;Never till then had I be|held what manly beauty was; yet had his charms been merely per&s;onal, I think they could not have obtained my heart. The tenderne&s;s he &s;hewed his dying mo|ther, his fond attention to her &s;lighte&s;t wi&s;h, the ea&s;e, the grace that marked his every action, his kindne&s;s to my Lucy and her &s;i&s;ters, joined to the pa&s;&s;ion he avowed for me, &s;oon won-my youthful <HI>heart;</HI> nor did a thought of blame ob|trude it&s;elf upon my mind, when I be|&s;towed <HI>it</HI> on &s;uch worth as his.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169">
On Mrs. Evelyn's death, my father &s;ent for me imediately&mdash;Sad was the parting, Lucy; yet I own my tears had different &s;ources, and flowed, perhaps, even more from love, than friend&s;hip&mdash;Though your amiable brother had offered every argument to &s;ooth my grief, and &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured me he would &s;olicit my father's con&s;ent, (of which I could not entertain a doubt), as &s;oon as it was decent after the lo&s;s of &s;o good a mother, yet I could not command my &s;orrows; they were impetuous, I conti|nued to weep, and neither eat or &s;lept dur|ing the journey. On my arrival at Fairfield, my father, in the &s;ame breath, inquired of Mrs. Winterman what illne&s;s I had ju&s;t recovered from, and pre&s;ented Mr. Harley to me as a particular friend of his and my brother's.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck with horror at the &s;ight of Mr. Harley, yet could by no means
<PB N="168" REF="170">
account for my di&s;gu&s;t; both his per|&s;on and addre&s;s were plea&s;ing, yet I &s;huddered when he approached me, as if he had been &s;ome noxious animal.&mdash;My father, in a few days, perceived my di&s;like to his friend, and &s;poke of my behaviour with re&s;entment.&mdash;I told him I would endeavour to alter my manners, though I could not conquer my feelings, which I confe&s;&s;ed were unaccountable, even to my&s;elf.&mdash;He &s;ternly replied, I would advi&s;e you to get the better of your prejudice, for it is beginning at the wrong end to &s;et out with an aver&s;ion to your hu&s;band. I was &s;truck motionle&s;s at this expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;tood for &s;everal minutes as if I had been petrified.&mdash;All the &s;orrows I had ever felt vani&s;hed from my remembrance, &s;wallowed up in the &s;uperior gulph of mi&s;eries that my fore|boding mind then warned me to appre|hend. But tears came to my relief, and &s;oon a ray of hope beamed through the
<PB N="169" REF="171">
gloomy pro&s;pect. My father was &s;e|vere, I knew, but I could not believe he could be &s;o inhuman as to &s;acrifice the peace and happine&s;s of an unoffending child&mdash;My brother would, I hoped, &s;o|licit for me, and &s;ure I thought my Eve|lyn could never plead in vain.</P>
<P>I retired to my chamber, and wrote you an account of every circum&s;tance that had happened; I was certain you would acquaint your brother with my &s;i|tuation, and I had no doubt but that he would ha&s;ten his application to my father&mdash;That letter never reached you, Lucy; the cruel Mrs. Winterman de|livered it into my father's hands, and he became the more incen&s;ed again&s;t me.</P>
<P>While I daily waited in anxious ex|pectation of hearing from you, I en|deavoured to a&s;&s;ume a more placid air and manner towards Mr. Harley than I
<PB N="170" REF="172">
had at fir&s;t put on; unfortunately he con&s;trued my behaviour into liking, and addre&s;&s;ed me with all the warmth of a declared lover. My letter had betrayed me to my father, he &s;aw through the thin veil of affability, and, as he after told me, rejoiced at my becoming a &s;a|crifice to my own deceit.</P>
<P>When a whole month had elap&s;ed, without my receiving a line from you, or my loved Henry, I grew almo&s;t di&s;tract|ed&mdash;I could no longer conceal the ago|nies of my mind&mdash;De&s;pair in&s;pired me with courage&mdash;I threw my&s;elf at my fa|ther's feet, revealed every &s;entiment of my heart, implored his forgivene&s;s, and in the humble&s;t, but mo&s;t earne&s;t, terms, be&s;ought him not to devote his child to certain mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>He heard me with compo&s;ure, and calmly replied, he did not think him&s;elf
<PB N="171" REF="173">
indebted to my confidence for revealing the &s;ecrets of my heart, as he was already apprized of the weakne&s;s of my conduct in attaching my affections, without his con&s;ent, to Mr. Evelyn; but though he had no power over my pa&s;&s;ions, I &s;hould find he had &s;ome over my per&s;on.&mdash;He then, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, &s;wore he would never be&s;tow his daughter on a man who had made her guilty of a breach in her fir&s;t duty, and meanly &s;trove to &s;teal her fooli&s;h heart after &s;o clande&s;tine a manner. I attempted to exculpate my Henry, but he command|ed my &s;ilence, and &s;ternly vowed I &s;hould accept of Mr. Harley for my hu&s;band, or from that hour be loaded with his cur&s;e; then left me drowned in tears, and &s;inking on the earth&mdash;O had it opened wide, and taken me to its bo&s;om, I had been ble&s;t indeed!</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="174">
After this dreadful interview, my &s;pirits were &s;o intirely depre&s;&s;ed by &s;or|row, that I was utterly unable to leave my chamber for above a week, during which time I wrote to your brother and my own; but both the&s;e letters met the &s;ame fate as my former one to you, and &s;erved, if po&s;&s;ible, to increa&s;e my father's rage, tho' heaven is my witne&s;s I &s;poke not har&s;hly of his cruel conduct. He intercepted every letter that was ad|dre&s;&s;ed to me; and, except the indul|gence of pen and ink to vent my &s;orrows, I was treated in every re&s;pect like a criminal confined in the Ba&s;tile.</P>
<P>In this deplorable &s;ituation you found me at your arrival in the country, when I was permitted to receive the tran&s;port of &s;eeing you; but Mrs. Winterman, you remember, never quitted the chamber, but &s;at like the figure of curio&s;ity, with eyes, ears, and mouth wide open, to
<PB N="173" REF="175">
catch every &s;yllable that pa&s;&s;ed between us&mdash;Though I of cour&s;e was &s;ilent, with regard to my &s;ituation, your per&s;picuity ea&s;ily di&s;covered that &s;ome unhappine&s;s of mind was the &s;ource of my illne&s;s; and my poor Sally Wat&s;on, who had been bani&s;hed from my &s;ight, as &s;he afterwards told me, acquainted you with all the par|ticulars of my di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of your vi&s;it to me, I know that Mr. Evelyn immediately waited upon my father, and made the mo&s;t liberal propo&s;als for his alliance&mdash;I al&s;o know, to my everla&s;ting &s;orrow, that my unkind, I will not call him cruel, father refu&s;ed them with di&s;dain; yet &s;till my faithful Henry per&s;evered, bore all the haughtine&s;s of cau&s;ele&s;sly of|fended pride, and offered even his whole e&s;tate to be &s;ettled or di&s;po&s;ed of at my father's plea&s;ure. Alas! it was in vain; I was not &s;acrificed to intere&s;t, but ca|price
<PB N="174" REF="176">
and re&s;entment, which carried him &s;o far as to command that all intercour&s;e of vi&s;its, me&s;&s;ages, &amp;c. between your fa|mily and ours might cea&s;e from that in|&s;tant.</P>
<P>During the time of my voluntary confinement to my chamber, I received &s;everal polite and tender billets of inquiry after my health from Mr. Harley; from the&s;e I formed a romantic idea, that the gentlene&s;s of his nature might be pre|vailed upon to relinqui&s;h his preten&s;ions to my per&s;on, if I could have re&s;olution &s;ufficient to acquaint him that my heart was engaged to another. I anticipated in my mind the plea&s;ure he would feel in rendering two per&s;ons happy, and my eyes often overflowed with gratitude and e&s;teem for Mr. Harley's &s;uppo&s;ed gene|ro&s;ity. This &s;imple &s;cheme became the darling of my imagination, and I re|&s;olved
<PB N="175" REF="177">
to put it in practice, as a la&s;t re|&s;ource.</P>
<P>From the time that this thought oc|curred to me, my &s;pirits grew better, and I rather wi&s;hed, than feared, a meeting with Mr. Harley&mdash;It was not long de|layed. Soon after his total rejection of Mr. Evelyn, my father came into my chamber, and acquainted me with every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed between them, in order, as he &s;aid, to reconcile me to my duty, by totally de&s;troying every vain imagination I might have conceived of an union with a family whom he di&s;|liked, for having attempted to &s;educe my affection, without the &s;anction of his ap|probation.</P>
<P>I replied not to this &s;evere determi|nation, but with my tears; but when he added, with the mo&s;t peremptory tone, that he expected I &s;hould be ready to
<PB N="176" REF="178">
be&s;tow my hand on Mr. Harley, without reluctance, that day &s;e'nnight; I again threw my&s;elf at his feet, offered to re|nounce all connexion with my loved Evelyn, with you, my Lucy, with all <HI>my</HI> world, provided he would recal his har&s;h command, and &s;uffer me to live and die his daughter. He looked upon me &s;ternly, and taking up a Bible that lay upon my table, &s;wore by it that nothing but my death &s;hould prevent my ful|filling the engagement he had made to Mr. Harley, at the time he had already mentioned; then left me, without wait|ing my reply.</P>
<P>The little hope I had conceived of Mr. Harley's genero&s;ity was now my &s;ole &s;upport, and I re&s;olved to put it to the proof immediately.&mdash;I &s;aw him from my window walking in the garden; I called for my hat, and with my tear-&s;woln eyes de&s;cended to him&mdash;He &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed,
<PB N="177" REF="179">
and rejoiced at &s;eeing me, but took no notice of tho&s;e &s;trong marked traces of &s;orrow that appeared on my countenance&mdash;I tried to &s;peak to him, but tears &s;topped my utterance, and the imperfect words died on my trembling lips.&mdash;I re|turned to my chamber, convinced of my own inability to expre&s;s my&s;elf properly on a &s;ubject I was &s;o much affected with, and thought I &s;hould be able to do it better in writing.&mdash;After many efforts, which all appeared inadequate to my feelings, I at length fini&s;hed a letter, in which I exhau&s;ted every argument that I thought could move his honour or pity, and engage him to renounce the worthle&s;s hand that could not give a heart. When I had &s;ealed and &s;ent it, the agitation of my mind became almo&s;t in&s;upportable, but &s;till I flattered my&s;elf that a certainty of any kind would afford me relief.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180">
I was not permitted to remain long in this error, for in an hour's time I received a very florid epi&s;tle from Mr. Harley, lamenting his misfortune in not having been able to engage my affections, but that as he had every thing to hope for from my virtue and good &s;en&s;e, he flattered him&s;elf that by a &s;eries of unremitted tenderne&s;s, he &s;hould at length triumph over every prejudice I might have conceived again&s;t him, and concluded with a&s;&s;uring me, that the reque&s;t contained in my letter was the only one I &s;hould ever make that he would ever refu&s;e. With the certainty I &s;o much wi&s;hed for, all my hopes were bla&s;ted, and I then thought it was impo&s;&s;ible I could ever be more wretched.&mdash;Vain pre&s;umption! tho&s;e &s;orrows were but the prelude to far greater woes.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181">
Warned by my folly, let no woman ever confe&s;s a prior pa&s;&s;ion for another object to him whom fate allots her for a hu&s;band. My fatal letter turned Mr. Harley's heart to &s;tone; his pride was piqued, and though I truly think he did not love me, he would have died rather than have &s;urrendered me to a trium|phant rival.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and wild vagaries now ru&s;hed into my troubled brain: I thought of getting off in &s;ome di&s;gui&s;e; of flying to my Henry&mdash;But then, would not my father force me from his arms? Might not &s;ome horrid &s;cene of blood&s;hed fol|low? Could I &s;u&s;tain the cur&s;e of di&s;|obedience? O no! my heart &s;hrunk within me at the &s;hocking thought.&mdash;My mother's dying form &s;eemed to ap|pear before me, and her la&s;t words to vibrate on my ear.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="182">
I could re&s;i&s;t no longer&mdash;And when my father came to reproach me with the letter, which Mr. Harley had &s;o unge|nerou&s;ly &s;hewn him, I pacified his wrath by telling him, with a compo&s;ure that amazed my&s;elf, that I was ready to obey his will, and &s;acrifice my peace, my happine&s;s, and all my &s;oul held dear, to his commands, and go a &s;ilent victim to the altar with Mr. Harley.&mdash;At that in&s;tant my father gazed on me with an a&s;toni&s;hed look, and &s;aid, My Julia is incapable of deceit, &s;he there|fore purpo&s;es what &s;he now promi&s;es, and means to make her father happy at la&s;t.</P>
<P>O, do not doubt it, Sir, I an&s;wered, if giving up much more than life can an&s;wer that great end, behold your daughter ready to make the &s;acrifice.&mdash;My father turned away his head to hide
<PB N="181" REF="183">
the &s;tarting tear, then took me in his arms and ble&s;&s;ed me.</P>
<P>I was a perfect Niobe; yet at that moment felt a tran&s;ient tran&s;port that ab&s;orbed my griefs.&mdash;Ble&s;t &s;ource of happine&s;s, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done my duty; why wert thou not for ever pre&s;ent with me? Why has this feeble frame been ever torn between thy dictates and contending pa&s;&s;ions!</P>
<P>My father was &s;o much plea&s;ed with me, that he became all kindne&s;s on the &s;udden. Sally Wat&s;on was allowed to attend me; I was no longer watched by Mrs. Winterman; and he was indul|gent enough to po&s;tpone my marriage for a fortnight without my reque&s;ting it, in hopes that I &s;hould, in that time, recover my chearfulne&s;s&mdash;Alas! it was for ever fled from me&mdash;and though I
<PB N="182" REF="184">
wore the &s;emblance of compo&s;ure all the day, my nights were pa&s;&s;ed in agonies.</P>
<P>My poor Wat&s;on was amazed at my conduct, and was afraid to mention the loved name of Evelyn.&mdash;But as &s;he found me frequently in tears, &s;he began to doubt the reality of my &s;eeming calm|ne&s;s, and ventured to acquaint me with the numberle&s;s &s;tratagems my Henry had vainly tried to accompli&s;h his hopes of &s;eeing me.&mdash;I was terrified at the ac|count &s;he gave me of the dangers to which he had expo&s;ed him&s;elf for me, and told her, that were it in my power to &s;ee him, I would decline the inter|view, as my fate was now irrevocably fixed, and nothing upon earth could alter it.</P>
<P>She then implored my forgivene&s;s, for having promi&s;ed to deliver a letter from Mr. Evelyn, which &s;he pre&s;ented to me.
<PB N="183" REF="185">
&mdash;I had not virtue to with&s;tand this trial; I bathed the precious relic with my tears, and placed it next my heart, from thence my an&s;wer flowed, in which I &s;olemnly conjured him, as he valued my happine&s;s here and hereafter, never to attempt to &s;ee me more.&mdash;I told him that I now con&s;idered my&s;elf as Mr. Harley's wife, and that from that mo|ment, I never would receive a letter from, or write to him again.&mdash;I poured forth a thou&s;and fervent wi&s;hes for his happine&s;s, and for yours, my Lucy, and bade him everla&s;tingly farewel.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of my injunctions he wrote again, and Wat&s;on brought his &s;econd letter; but I returned it as it came, un|opened, and fancied I had now gained a perfect victory over my fondne&s;s.&mdash;How vain the &s;elf-&s;ufficience of our boa&s;ted rea&s;on!&mdash;The letter was no &s;ooner gone than I a thou&s;and times
<PB N="184" REF="186">
repented my not reading it.&mdash;Perhaps my Henry acquie&s;ced in my reque&s;t, and readily re&s;igned me to his rival.&mdash;Had I been &s;ure of that, it would, I thought, have ea&s;ed my tortured mind, for I too fondly felt his &s;orrows added to my own.</P>
<P>My days thus wa&s;ting in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery, brought forward that &s;uperla|tively &s;ad one, that was to mark my future life with angui&s;h. As it ap|proached I looked on it with horror, yet I wi&s;hed it pa&s;t. On the preceding evening my father took me by the hand and led me to the garden, where, as we walked, he conde&s;cended to apolo|gize for the &s;eeming &s;everity of his con|duct towards me, by &s;aying, that he apprehended my oppo&s;ition to his will, had proceeded from my mother's hay|ing ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in&s;pired me with an aver&s;ion to his per&s;on, and a contempt of his au|thority, which latter article of unduti|fulne&s;s,
<PB N="185" REF="187">
at lea&s;t, he was re&s;olved to conquer.</P>
<P>In the zeal of my filial affection to her injured memory, I exclaimed, O, Sir! you do her wrong.&mdash;I &s;ee my mother now, and hear her dying words.&mdash;At that in&s;tant, I beheld my Henry's form, concealed beneath a pea&s;ant's garb, &s;tanding near me; I gave an heavy &s;igh and &s;unk upon the earth.&mdash;My father &s;tood amazed, and thought the power of fancy had &s;o far operated on my weak &s;pirits as to conjure up a &s;pectre to my view.&mdash;He called for in&s;tant help, and when my &s;ight returned, I &s;till be|held my Henry's face, pale and dejected, with his hands fa&s;t clo&s;ed, leaning a|gain&s;t a tree.&mdash;I ro&s;e, the moment I had &s;trength &s;ufficient, and re&s;ting on my father's arm, returned into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188">
My father's late returning tenderne&s;s &s;eemed much alarmed at this accident, and he told Mr. Harley, before me, that he thought it proper to de&s;er our mar|riage for a few days longer.&mdash;Judge of their mutual &s;urprize when I reque&s;ted that it might not be delayed. The wretch condemned a&s;ks but an addition to his mi&s;ery, who begs a reprieve when hope of pardon is pa&s;t. You may be &s;ure they readily a&s;&s;ented, and I de&s;ired leave to retire to my chamber for the remainder of the evening.</P>
<P>There I indulged my &s;orrows, and gave a loo&s;e to tears and to complainings&mdash;There I reproached the cruel Henry for having di&s;obeyed my la&s;t command, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf and me to certain ruin, had he been detected.&mdash;And there I tried to tear-his image from my tortur|ed bo&s;om&mdash;<Q>But in the foldings of my
<PB N="187" REF="189">
heart, he lived with life, and far the dearer he.</Q></P>
<P>After a night pa&s;&s;ed in the bittere&s;t conflict with my&s;elf, I aro&s;e more calm, and hoped the force of duty to my fa|ther, with a patient re&s;ignation to my irre&s;i&s;tible doom, might enable me to go through the awful and irrevocable cere|mony with compo&s;ure.&mdash;Before I left my chamber, I begged of heaven not to impute to me the &s;acrilegous, lovele&s;s vow, I was compelled to make.&mdash;But when the &s;olemn words of adjuration, which begins the ceremony, were pro|nounced, I could no longer contain my &s;orrow; it bur&s;t forth; and had not my father &s;upported me, I had again &s;unk lifele&s;s on the earth.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion Mr. Harley appeared rather more offended than alarmed, and behaved with a gloomy kind of tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="188" REF="190">
towards me; while my father &s;eemed to impute, what he called accident, to the weak &s;tate of my nerves; and, as &s;oon as I was able to &s;tand again, they proceeded to fini&s;h the ceremony, and the indi&s;&s;oluble knot was tied.</P>
<P>In about a week after I was, to my great &s;atisfaction, conveyed to Harley-hill: I flattered my&s;elf that change of place and objects might amu&s;e my mind, and that when I had quitted Fairfield I &s;hould lo&s;e the remembrance of the &s;or|rows I had experienced there.&mdash;There was another, and a &s;tronger rea&s;on, that made me de&s;irous of leaving it, the vi|cinity of your hou&s;e to ours.&mdash;I had never ventured to walk in the garden, or even to look out at a window, &s;ince the evening before I was married, le&s;t my eyes &s;hould encounter their deare&s;t, yet mo&s;t dreaded, object.&mdash;Alas! I knew not that grief had preyed upon my
<PB N="189" REF="191">
Henry's &s;pirits, and that he was at that time confined to his bed with a &s;low fever.</P>
<P>I call heaven to witne&s;s, that, from the moment I became a wife, I mo&s;t &s;olemnly purpo&s;ed to fulfil my duty, and never give Mr. Harlcy the &s;malle&s;t cau&s;e of di&s;content.&mdash;I concealed my grief, and even endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume a chear|ful air; I received his friends and relations as graciou&s;ly as I had power to do, and if a &s;igh e&s;caped me in his pre&s;ence, I blu&s;hed for having committed an invo|luntary fault; yet had I not at that time given vent to my &s;woln bo&s;om, and poured forth all its &s;orrows to my faith|ful Wat&s;on, I mu&s;t have died, over|charged with woe.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the hurry and di&s;&s;ipation of our wedding vi&s;its were at an end, my father left us, and from that hour Mr.
<PB N="190" REF="192">
Harley became &s;ullen and &s;evere.&mdash;When we have been alone, and I have tried to &s;ooth his temper, and to force a &s;mile from his contracted brow, he would take out the fatal letter I had written to him before our marriage, con it over &s;everal times, then look upon me with contempt, and &s;ay, <Q>'Tis damned di&s;&s;imulation all.</Q>&mdash;I could not, at &s;uch times, command my tears, in &s;pite of me they flowed.&mdash;He then would &s;neer, and &s;ay, <Q>Thank heaven, you feel the pangs of di&s;appointed love.&mdash;So far we meet on equal terms.</Q></P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed four months in this de|plorable &s;tate; I had then the additional misfortune of lo&s;ing my father, who died in scotland, and appointed Mr. Harley guardian to my brother.&mdash;On this ac|count it was nece&s;&s;ary for Mr. Harley to go there; and after my grief for my father had a little &s;ub&s;ided, I felt a &s;ecret
<PB N="191" REF="193">
&s;atisfaction in thinking that bu&s;ine&s;s, and a new &s;cene, might contribute to rai&s;e his &s;pirits, and give a more chear|ful and contented turn to his mind.</P>
<P>From the time he left me, my days were &s;pent in &s;olitude, nor did my feet e'er pa&s;s the bounds of his deme&s;ne.&mdash;Mi&s;s Harley then was with me; our &s;ouls but ill accorded; &s;he was quickly di&s;|gu&s;ted with the retired life I led, and quit|ted Harley-hill &s;oon after her brother.</P>
<P>It was then the autumnal &s;ea&s;on, and thus freed from con&s;traint, my time was all my own; a happine&s;s I never had en|joyed before; and when the moon &s;hone bright, I frequently indulged my medi|tations, even till midnight, in a grove and temple, that were &s;ituated at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, at the extremity of our improvements. I u&s;ed to have lights placed in the temple, or
<PB N="192" REF="194">
rather &s;ummer-hou&s;e, that when I grew tired of walking I might &s;it there, and read, or weep, unheard and un&s;een.</P>
<P>In this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot I &s;at one even|ing, gazing thro' the dim medium of my tears at Henry's la&s;t dear letter&mdash;I needed not to read it, the words were but too deeply engraved upon my heart&mdash;I thought I heard a little &s;ound of gently treading feet, I &s;natched up my loved trea&s;ure, and placed it in my bo&s;om, then ro&s;e to &s;ee from whence the noi&s;e proceeded&mdash;My Henry &s;tood before me, but &s;o much emaciated and altered, that I &s;carcely knew him&mdash;I &s;hrieked, and would have fled; he cla&s;ped me in his arms, and held me there&mdash;I could not force my way; nor when he loo&s;ed me from his hold, had I the power to move.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195">
He knelt and wept before me&mdash;Offended as I was at his intru&s;ion, my breaking heart pleaded his cau&s;e too &s;trongly, and I reproached him not but with my tears. Ju&s;t then I heard the trampling of a hor&s;e clo&s;e by the temple &s;ide, which joined a private road that Mr. Harley &s;ometimes u&s;ed&mdash;I bade my Henry fly&mdash;He pre&s;&s;ed me to his heart, and left me&mdash;It was our la&s;t embrace. The door that he came in at to the gar|den then &s;tood open, and I hoped he might e&s;cape un&s;een.</P>
<P>Fear lent me wings; I ran, or rather flew, into the hou&s;e, and gained my chamber; the family were all at re&s;t but Wat&s;on&mdash;My looks were wild, &s;he trem|bled at my appearance, and eagerly a&s;ked me what had happened&mdash;I could not an&s;wer her, but &s;at fixed in a gloomy &s;tupor.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196">
When I could &s;peak, I ordered her to bed&mdash;When left alone, I became quite di&s;tracted, I tore my hair, and ran about the room, I knew not why; I threw up the &s;a&s;h to li&s;ten to &s;ome &s;ound, and was a thou&s;and times tempted to throw my|&s;elf out of it&mdash;I could hear nothing but the pa&s;&s;ing breeze, and dogs that bayed the moon.&mdash;I &s;tole &s;oftly down &s;tairs, and re&s;olved to return to the temple, from whence I could look upon the road, and &s;ee if any one was there; but terror had un&s;trung my trembling limbs, and they would not &s;upport me, and in all the mi&s;ery of anxious &s;u&s;pence, I waited for the morning.</P>
<P>When the day dawned, I began to flatter my&s;elf that I might have been mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing the hor&s;eman that pa&s;&s;ed the temple &s;hould be Mr. Harley; and yet he, and he only, had a key that opened all the gates that led into that road. Conjecture was in vain&mdash;my poor
<PB N="195" REF="197">
di&s;turbed imagination could not form one that did not teem with horror.</P>
<P>About &s;ix o'clock I heard a confu&s;ed noi&s;e at a di&s;tance, and a cry of fire&mdash;I looked, but &s;aw none; the &s;ervants who were up ran towards the &s;ound, and quickly brought me word that the &s;um|mer-hou&s;e was in flames&mdash;But a &s;till more horrid &s;ound now pierced my &s;ink|ing heart: in looking for water to ex|tingui&s;h the fire, they had found Mr. Harley's body weltering in his blood, with a di&s;charged pi&s;tol clenched in his &s;tiffened hand.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants rai&s;ed the body, and as they brought it towards the hou&s;e, I heard their loud laments, and ru&s;hed among&s;t them&mdash;Think how my eyes were bla&s;ted with the &s;ight! They could not bear it for a &s;ingle moment&mdash;I &s;unk into a &s;woon&mdash;For above &s;ix days I re|mained

Though &s;he has never hinted at it, I am certain that in my ravings I betrayed my&s;elf, and told the horrid &s;ecret of my having been the occa&s;ion, though not the cau&s;e, of my hu&s;band's death.</P>
<P>When my &s;en&s;es and my mi&s;ery re|turned together, I ince&s;&s;antly prayed and wi&s;hed for death&mdash;<Q>But he comes not at call, nor mends his &s;lowe&s;t pace for plaints or cries.</Q> As a &s;acrifice of atonement to my hu&s;band's memory, I bound my&s;elf by the mo&s;t &s;olemn vow never to &s;ee my Henry more&mdash;Yet &s;till I own I wi&s;hed to know his fate, and be informed what provocation he had re|ceived' from Mr. Harley, that could ex|culpate him from the foul crime of mur|der. I knew he had not purpo&s;ed this
<PB N="197" REF="199">
vile act, and I mo&s;t earne&s;tly hoped that &s;elf-defence alone had forced him to commit it&mdash;I &s;ometimes, for a moment, even wi&s;hed that Henry had fallen in|&s;tead of Harley. I con&s;idered my&s;elf as an accomplice in his death, and was a thou&s;and times tempted to relieve my mind from the agony I &s;uffered, by re|vealing the unhappy circum&s;tances that occa&s;ioned it&mdash;But then, forgive me heaven! my love returned, and I rejoiced the man who killed my hu&s;band was in &s;afety.</P>
<P>Mr. Harley's relations took every po&s;&s;ible pains to di&s;cover his murderer&mdash;Shocking term, my Lucy&mdash;Large re|wards were offered, but no trace ap|peared that led even to &s;u&s;picion. The circum&s;tance of the &s;ummer-hou&s;e being &s;et on fire was al&s;o unaccounted for, as none but Wat&s;on knew I had
<PB N="198" REF="200">
lights there, which in my fright I had forgot to extingui&s;h.</P>
<P>From the time I recovered my rea&s;on, though anxious for his fate beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion, I never mentioned Mr. Evelyn's name. I concealed all the mi&s;ery I felt within my tortured bo&s;on; nay had that kind of tenderne&s;s for Wat&s;on, which Macbeth expre&s;&s;es for his wife, when he &s;ays, "Be innocent of the knowledge."&mdash;The unhappine&s;s of my mind had humbled me &s;o far, as to make me look up with re&s;pect to my &s;ervant&mdash;She was deceived by my outward &s;emblance, and thought that grief for Mr. Harley's &s;hocking and untimely fate was all the woe that preyed upon my heart.

<P>My calmne&s;s left me; your danger rou&s;ed my pa&s;&s;ions; we both fired at the &s;ame in&s;tant&mdash;I &s;aw the unhappy Har|ley fall&mdash;I threw my&s;elf upon my knees be&s;ide him, but &s;oon di&s;covered that all help was vain.&mdash;Heaven is my witne&s;s! that at that moment, I wi&s;hed to have been in his &s;ituation rather than my own.&mdash;But when I thought of what you mu&s;t have &s;uffered had he lived, it in &s;ome mea&s;ure reconciled me to his death; tho' never, Julia, will my mind know peace, for having been the unhappy in&s;trument of his untimely fate.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="203">
I was a thou&s;and times tempted to give my&s;elf up to ju&s;tice, and expiate my crime by yielding up my life&mdash;But there again you interfered; I could not bear the thought of loading you with igno|miny, of bla&s;ting your fair fame, and leaving you alone to &s;tand the &s;hock of infamy.</P>

<HEAD>LADY STANLEY TO LADY JULIANA.</HEAD>
<P>MY truly loved and mo&s;t unhappy friend! Why have you broke my heart? I think my tears will never cea&s;e to flow. You deign to a&s;k my pity, you have more, much more, my admiration and e&s;teem.&mdash;Mo&s;t truly do I revere your fortitude, and mourn your &s;orrows.</P>
<P>In what &s;ad ills has your inhuman father's cruelty involved my haple&s;s bro|ther, the ill-fated Harley, and your

dear &s;uffering &s;elf? Yet I re&s;pect the mildne&s;s with which you treat the me|mory of him who was at once the author of your being, and your woes.</P>
<P>I at this moment blu&s;h from recollect|ing the petulance with which I have often je&s;ted with your grief, unknowing of the cau&s;e. Can you forgive me Julia? Yes, I know you will, though I cannot pardon my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that any human being can think you guilty of Mr. Harley's death, and heaven, that judges from in|tention only, will mo&s;t &s;urely acquit you. Nor did my unhappy brother, I am well convinced, ever purpo&s;e &s;uch a crime; his guilt was accidental, and he mo&s;t &s;urely forfeited his life in expiation of it.&mdash;The rigour of the laws could a&s;k no more, and heaven, I tru&s;t, ac|cepted of his penitence.</P>

A thou&s;and things recur to my re|membrance, that &s;trongly proved my brother wi&s;hed to die; he concealed his illne&s;s till it was pa&s;t cure, nor even then would be prevailed upon to keep his bed, or take any kind of medicine.</P>
<P>Fear not, my friend, that I &s;hall ever more attempt to change your purpo&s;e, or &s;trive to draw you from your &s;anc|tuary.&mdash;The world contains no joys for grief-worn minds.&mdash;The &s;lender &s;uper|&s;tructure of all earthly plea&s;ures, mu&s;t &s;oon decay if not &s;upported by an heart at ea&s;e.&mdash;But tho&s;e more permanent de|lights, that ari&s;e from an holy and reli|gious fervor, which, like the vital flame, is never extingui&s;hed, &s;hall &s;till be yours, and time, that le&s;&s;ens the value of all other enjoyments, will but increa&s;e theirs, 'till even this life may afford you &s;ueh a &s;tate of happine&s;s, as only can be|heightened in the next.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>SIR WILLIAM STANLEY TO MR. EVELYN.</HEAD>
<P>DEAR Charles, matters are now come to &s;uch a cri&s;is in the De&s;mond family, that I think your pre&s;ence, and yours only, can adju&s;t them.</P>
<P>I will, however, relate the particulars of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and leave you to determine, with regard to your com|ing, as you think proper.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214">
The card parties at Sir James De&s;|mond's have been, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, to all appearance, broken up; our dear Emma regained her ea&s;e and chearful|ne&s;s, and her hu&s;band &s;eemed to behave with more affection and attention towards her, than he had done &s;ince her arrival in London.</P>
<P>But what can e&s;cape the piercing eyes of love? Emma &s;oon found out that the &s;cene was only changed, and that the nightly origes were &s;till held at Madame Dupont's in Bury-&s;treet; her hu&s;band, who is much to be pitied, having been for &s;ome time in the country.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this di&s;covery, &s;ome little altercation pa&s;&s;ed between Sir James and Lady De&s;mond; he had, however, art enough to lull her anxiety to re&s;t, and all &s;eemed peace and har|mony between them.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215">
On Saturday la&s;t Emma dined at our hou&s;e, Sir James was expected, but &s;ent an apology; after dinner &s;he was affected with &s;ome little complaints incident to her &s;ituation, for &s;he is far gone with child, and expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to go home&mdash;Lucy would have attended her, but we had other company, nor did &s;he think her &s;i&s;ter very ill.</P>
<P>Our carriage was immediately order|ed for her, and &s;he left us.&mdash;In a very &s;hort time after, one of her &s;ervants came running, almo&s;t breathle&s;s, to our hou&s;e, and entreated I would come to his lady directly.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t at the &s;ame minute a me&s;&s;en|ger brought me a note from Sir James De&s;mond, dated from a bailiff's hou&s;e in Carey-&s;treet, reque&s;ting me to come to him in&s;tantly.&mdash;I immediately &s;up|po&s;ed Emma's alarm to proceed from a
<PB N="214" REF="216">
knowledge of her hu&s;band's &s;ituation, and flew to her to relieve her apprehen|&s;ions and a&s;&s;ure her of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>When I entered her apartment I found her lying breathle&s;s on a couch, her maids in vain endeavouring to recover her from a &s;woon; there was a letter lying by her, which I knew to be her hu&s;band's writing, and was &s;hocked at his inhumanity, in having acquainted her with his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;ent off directly for a &s;urgeon to bleed her, and al&s;o a note to Lucy, de&s;ir|ing her to acquaint her company, that Lady De&s;mond was taken ill, and come to her as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;I waited in hopes that her &s;en&s;es would return, that I might be able to &s;et her mind at ea&s;e about her hu&s;band, but with all the aid that could be given her, &s;he relap&s;ed from one fainting fit into another, and
<PB N="215" REF="217">
the &s;urgeon who attended, &s;eemed to be apprehen&s;ive for her life.</P>
<P>My Lucy was almo&s;t di&s;tracted; the poor little Fanny clung round her dying mother, and, I confe&s;s, I never was &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed upon any occa|&s;ion in my life.</P>
<P>Lucy caught up the letter that lay by Lady De&s;mond, and before &s;he could have read more than half of it, &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and &s;unk upon the &s;ofa, by her &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;I &s;ei&s;ed the contagious &s;croll and read the following lines.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO LADY DESMOMD.</HEAD>
<P>Before this paper will reach your hands, we &s;hall be many miles a&s;under.&mdash;I hope your &s;en&s;e and virtue will en|able you to conquer any remains of ten|derne&s;s
<PB N="216" REF="218">
you may yet feel, for a man who acknowledges him&s;elf unworthy of it.</P>
<P>Our affections are not in our power, and though I own that mine have &s;trayed to an object perhaps le&s;s ami|able than your&s;elf, believe me, Emma, I would not thus publicly have de|ferted you, had it been in my power to have &s;upported appearances any longer. But, in truth, I am a ruined man, and had I &s;taid, mu&s;t have involved you in mi&s;ery without extricating my&s;elf; for my pride would never &s;uffer me to bear the being indebted to your family, for the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and I have long &s;ince parted with the la&s;t of mine.</P>
<P>The &s;incere&s;t &s;atisfaction I can at pre|&s;ent feel, ari&s;es from the certainty that your brother will take care of you and my little Fanny, and will properly edu|cate
<PB N="217" REF="219">
the child you carry, if it &s;hould be a &s;on.</P>
<P>The generous girl who accompanies my flight, has &s;acrificed all that was dear to her, for my &s;ake.&mdash;Bear her no hatred, Emma; &s;he is much le&s;s to blame than him who, for the la&s;t time, &s;ub&s;cribes him&s;elf your hu&s;band,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>J. DESMOND.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I was almo&s;t &s;truck &s;peechle&s;s with indignation at the peru&s;al of this vile paper, and was no longer &s;urpri&s;ed at Lady De&s;mond's &s;ituation, but could by no means reconcile its contents with the &s;ummons I had &s;o lately received from Sir James.&mdash;I in&s;tantly &s;et about unravelling the my&s;tery, and thought, if I could bring Sir James De&s;mond back to his hou&s;e, his pre&s;ence would more effectually contribute to his wife's
<PB N="218" REF="220">
recovery, than any other medicine that could be tried.</P>
<P>When I reached Carey-&s;treet I &s;aw Sir James De&s;mond's po&s;t-chai&s;e and four hor&s;es &s;tanding at &s;ome di&s;tance from the bailiff's hou&s;e.&mdash;When I came into the room where he was, Madame Dupont was &s;eated by him, in an elegant travelling dre&s;s.&mdash;He immediately &s;tart|ed up, and &s;aid, Sir William, I fear your delay has undone me; I &s;hall not get out of this odious hou&s;e to-night.&mdash;I replied, Sir James, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly think of &s;peaking to you upon this &s;ub|ject before a third per&s;on; I therefore mu&s;t reque&s;t that this Lady may be &s;hewn into another apartment.</P>
<P>Madame Dupont ro&s;e with the mo&s;t di&s;dainful air, rung the bell, and &s;aid, &s;he thought I might gue&s;s that there were no &s;ecrets now between Sir James and
<PB N="219" REF="221">
her, but that &s;he &s;hould, however, com+ply with my ill-bred reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon the waiter's entrance, he told her there was not a vacant room in the hou&s;e, but that there was an elderly lady in the next, who had been confined there about three weeks, and &s;he might, if &s;he plea&s;ed, walk in there.</P>
<P>She tripped out with the waiter, and in a very few minutes we heard her utter a loud &s;cream.&mdash;I ru&s;hed out to &s;ee what was the occa&s;ion of it, when I be|held Lady Morton's venerable figure bending over her unworthy daughter, and heard her &s;ay, My child! you are come at la&s;t.&mdash;Madame Dupont turned from her, and with a look of indignation, &s;aid to me, I &s;uppo&s;e this is your &s;cheme, Sir William.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="222">
The good old Lady gazed in &s;ilence at us both, the tears fa&s;t falling down her pallid cheek.&mdash;I addre&s;&s;ed her with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, and told her, I was &s;incerely &s;orry to &s;ee her in a place &s;o ill betfiting her rank and worth&mdash;She calmly an&s;wered, I can't feel &s;orrow in Maria's pre&s;ence, if love and duty bring her to this place.&mdash;I thought tho&s;e words mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily affect her daugh|ter deeply, and bowing, retired from the chamber.</P>
<P>When I returned to Sir James, I ac|quainted him with the interview I had been witne&s;s to.&mdash;He &s;eemed much &s;ur|pri&s;ed, and &s;aid, It cannot be; Lady Morton is at her nephew's hou&s;e in Shrop&s;hire; Madame Dupont a&s;&s;ured me &s;he was there.&mdash;I was charmed at his di&s;covering this in&s;tance of her fal&s;hood and inhumanity, but could not expa|tiate long on the &s;ubject, as I was impa|tient
<PB N="221" REF="223">
to acquaint him with Lady De&s;|mond's &s;ituation.&mdash;He was affected, even to tears, at my relation, but &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible he could ever &s;ee her more.&mdash;I told him, if he per&s;i&s;ted in this re&s;olution, it was almo&s;t certain that his wife would never &s;ee another morn|ing, and that not only the whole world, but his own heart mu&s;t tell him he had murdered her.</P>
<P>He &s;tarted wildly at the&s;e words, and &s;truck his brea&s;t&mdash;Then &s;aid, You know it is impo&s;&s;ible, Sir William, I cannot if I would, go &s;ee my injured Emma.&mdash;That villain Sewell has un|done us all, 'tis at his &s;uit I am here.</P>
<P>I replied, mo&s;t willingly do I forgive his villainy, &s;ince he has detained you for the happy purpo&s;e of &s;aving Lady De&s;mond's life, and your own character; but do not waver any longer; come
<PB N="222" REF="224">
with me this moment, or we may be too late, I will be an&s;werable to the bailiff for Sewell's claim, let it be what it may.</P>
<P>Sir James again repeated, It is im|po&s;&s;ible&mdash;I can't for&s;ake Maria, &s;he has left all for me.&mdash;She never can return to her hu&s;band, and I will not abandon her to want and infamy.&mdash;Emma has virtue and religion to &s;upport my lo&s;s, and all who know, love and e&s;teem her; I am the only man on earth that would for&s;ake her, but &s;he has better friends than &s;uch a wretch as me.</P>
<P>Long was our argument before I could prevail, but he at length con|&s;ented to throw him&s;elf at Lady De&s;|mond's feet, and if &s;he received him, as the returning prodigal, to remain with her till &s;he was able to go abroad with him, if it &s;hould be her choice; but
<PB N="223" REF="225">
that on no account would he remain in England a bankrupt and a beggar.&mdash;But the chief point he in&s;i&s;ted upon, was, that if he gave up Madame Du|pont, &s;he &s;hould be taken care of out of the wreck of his fortunes, and not be &s;uffered to know di&s;tre&s;s on his account, but have &s;ome competent annuity &s;ettled upon her for her &s;upport.</P>
<P>Nothing but Lady De&s;mond's life being at &s;take, could have made me comply with the&s;e terms; for her &s;ake I acceded to them all, and ratified the engagement with my honour, provided he would quit the bailiff's hou&s;e with|out &s;eeing his Circe.&mdash;He agreed, and &s;at down to write a &s;hort farewel.</P>
<P>There remained now, I imagined, no|thing to be done, but to pa&s;s a &s;ecurity to the bailiff for Sewell's demand, which was fifteen hundred pounds, and carry Sir
<PB N="224" REF="226">
directly to his own hou&s;e&mdash;But to my great concern and &s;urprize, I found that there were already writs and executions, upon &s;undry notes and bonds, lodged in the bailiff's hand, to the amount of twelve thou&s;and pounds, and that he would by no means con&s;ent to enlarge his pri&s;oner till the&s;e debts were di&s;|charged.&mdash;Had I been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o large a &s;um, and would have laid it down, that would not have procured Sir James's relea&s;e at that time, as it was Saturday night, the &s;heriff's office was &s;hut, and the governor of this enchanted ca&s;tle would not &s;uffer his gue&s;t to de|part 'till every form of law was fulfilled.</P>
<P>I had no re&s;ource left but an applica|cation to the bailiff's humanity, by ac|quainting him with Lady De&s;mond's &s;ituation, and offering to be &s;ecurity for Sir James's forth-coming on Monday morning.&mdash;The man pau&s;ed for &s;ome
<PB N="225" REF="227">
time; then &s;aid, So, the madam that came here with his honour, is not his wife&mdash;The&s;e are bad doings, and &s;he &s;hall walk out of my hou&s;e directly&mdash;and if &s;o be, that your honour will get another per&s;on to be &s;ecurity with you, the gentleman &s;hall go and &s;ee his &s;ick lady, for I never was hard-hearted in my life.</P>
<P>I immediately &s;ent to my friend Mr. Drummond, who, at my reque&s;t, became re&s;pon&s;ible with me for Sir James's ap|pearance.&mdash;I then ordered a chair to be in readine&s;s to convey Madame Du|pont where &s;he thought proper, as &s;oon as we were gone out of the hou&s;e.&mdash;I got Sir James into my carriage, and drove as hard as po&s;&s;ible to Charles|&s;treet.</P>
<P>In our way, I inquired how his friend Sewell had been &s;o far irritated again&s;t
<PB N="226" REF="228">
him as to arre&s;t him, without giving him the lea&s;t previous notice of his in|tention? he told me, that he had di&s;|covered his de&s;ign of eloping with Ma|dame Dupont, by a note which &s;he had dropped, in which the time and place of their &s;etting out was fixed; for, at the very &s;pot, which was in Park-lane, and on the in&s;tant of their meeting, the bailiffs &s;eized him.&mdash;He called Sewell a thou&s;and opprobrious names, and &s;wore his blood &s;hould expiate his villainy.&mdash;Yet, at the &s;ame time, he &s;aid, he re|joiced in his being detained, if his pre|&s;ence could relieve one pang of Lady De&s;mond's; but he was certain &s;he mu&s;t feel more &s;orrow from &s;eeing him lan|gui&s;h out his life in a pri&s;on, as he mu&s;t probably do upon his being &s;urrendered back into cu&s;tody again, than &s;he would have known from his leaving her.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="229">
As we drew near Berkeley-&s;quare he became extremely agitated, and talked and looked as if he was di&s;tracted.&mdash;I was &s;en&s;ible of a mixed &s;en&s;ation to|wards him, compounded of compa&s;&s;ion and contempt, and felt very unea&s;y ap|prehen&s;ions for the con&s;equences of the interview between him and our dear Emma.&mdash;He entered his hou&s;e like a culprit, without even daring to enquire into the &s;tate of his wife's health. When I went up &s;tairs, I found &s;he was in bed, and that her fainting fits had &s;ub&s;ided about half an hour, that &s;he was perfectly &s;en&s;ible, though &s;peech|le&s;s, and that her tears flowed abun|dantly.</P>
<P>When I approached the bed-&s;ide, &s;he ca&s;t a look, expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t anxious inquiry, towards me, to which I immediately replied, He waits but your permi&s;&s;ion to throw him&s;elf at his
<PB N="228" REF="230">
loved Emma's feet.&mdash;She rai&s;ed her&s;elf with an amazing quickne&s;s, and opened wide her arms, but in&s;tantly &s;unk back, and fainted quite away.</P>
<P>While the per&s;ons about her were u&s;ing means for her recovery, I brought Sir James into the room; he knelt by her bed&s;ide and wept: the moment her &s;en&s;es returned, &s;he gazed upon him with a look of tenderne&s;s, caught up his hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips, and with a &s;carcely articulate voice, &s;aid, You will not leave me?&mdash;He replied, Never, by heaven, my love! and cla&s;ped her in his arms.&mdash;Her joy be|came too powerful, and &s;he again re|lap&s;ed into a &s;tate of weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>I forced Sir James out of the cham|ber, and never yet &s;aw any per&s;on &s;o &s;trongly affected as he appeared to be; he called him&s;elf a murderer, &s;aid he
<PB N="229" REF="231">
had never known how tenderly he loved his wife till that &s;ad hour, vowed if &s;he died, he would de&s;troy him&s;elf, and doubted the po&s;&s;ibility of her forgiving him.&mdash;Yet, in the mid&s;t of all his fond emotions, he lamented the unhappy &s;ituation in which he had involved Ma|dame Dupont; but fortunately he has &s;ince received a letter from her, which has entirely relieved his apprehen&s;ions for her, and contributed more effectually to the re&s;toration of his affections, where they were ju&s;tly due, than any other circum&s;tance could po&s;&s;ibly have done.</P>
<P>In this letter &s;he loaded him with the mo&s;t opprobrious terms, and added the epithet of mean, or poor &s;pirited, to them all; thanked heaven for being relea&s;ed from a wretch who was con|temptible enough to return home, and a&s;k forgivene&s;s of his wife&mdash;Said, her &s;pirit could never brook &s;uch meanne&s;s,
<PB N="230" REF="232">
and that therefore &s;he had &s;ought, and found protection, in the arms of a man every way his &s;uperior, who was neither a bankrupt in honour, in fortune, or in love.&mdash;She a&s;&s;ured him of her &s;incere dete&s;tation, and de&s;ired, if his wife's re|lations &s;hould be weak enough to tru&s;t him with his liberty, that he &s;hould avoid hers and Lord Somners pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Sir James was almo&s;t petrified at the peru&s;al of this extraordinary epi&s;tle; but upon recollection, &s;aid he felt him&s;elf re|lieved from a weight which only &s;uch behaviour could ever have removed, as &s;he had art &s;ufficient to per&s;uade him, that the violence of her pa&s;&s;ion for him alone could have prevailed on her to &s;werve from virtue; but he was now con|vinced that it was her aver&s;ion to the &s;o|ber duties of a married life that had oc|ca&s;ioned her mi&s;conduct. He however reproached him&s;elf &s;everely as the prime
<PB N="231" REF="233">
cau&s;e of her crimes and follies, which he &s;aid he &s;hould repent of, along with his own, to the la&s;t hour of his life.</P>
<P>A new cau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s now occurred; Lady De&s;mond was &s;eized with labour pains; I left Lucy with her, and brought Sir James to my hou&s;e; ye&s;terday morn|ing &s;he was delivered of a &s;on, who, tho' born two months before his time, is likely to live, and &s;he, thank heaven, is in a fair way of recovery.</P>
<P>This morning I accompanied the pe|nitent baronet back to his pri&s;on in Carey-&s;treet, where he &s;aid he &s;hould be content to pa&s;s his days, provided Em|ma could be made happy. I find, upon enquiry, that mo&s;t of his debts are of the &s;ame nature of Sewell's demand, from whom he did not receive above five hundred for the bond of fifteen.&mdash;The&s;e
<PB N="232" REF="234">
matters mu&s;t be litigated, and the &s;coun|drels who have cheated him expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>About noon I procured his relea&s;e upon bail; and the moment I returned home, though much fatigued, &s;at down to give you this long and circum&s;tantial detail of every thing relative to our dear Emma.</P>
<P>I again repeat my wi&s;h for your return to London; your pre&s;ence will diffu&s;e tranquility and joy among&s;t us all&mdash;But let we warn you, my dear Charles, again&s;t being too rigidly virtuous; the baronet is truly penitent&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>And in &s;ooth &s;o humbled,</L>
<L>That he hath left part of his grief</L>
<L>With me, to &s;uffer with him.</L></Q>
<P>He &s;eems to dete&s;t his former follies, particularly his fondne&s;s for play, which
<PB N="233" REF="235">
he confe&s;&s;es has involved him, and all that is dear to him, in beggary and ruin.</P>
<P>With &s;incere concern I tell you, that my dear Lucy has for &s;ome time pa&s;t en|tirely lo&s;t her chearfulne&s;s and vivacity; &s;he has received a long letter, or rather hi&s;tory, from Lady Juliana Harley, which &s;he &s;ays &s;he cannot communicate even to me&mdash;She &s;huts her&s;elf up for hours to read this doleful tale, and comes out of her dre&s;&s;ing room, with her eyes &s;woln with tears.&mdash;Thank heaven! the woes &s;he weeps are not her own.</P>

<HEAD>MR. EVELYN TO SIR WILLIAM STANLEY.</HEAD>
<P>HOW could you, my dear Stanley, make me &s;uffer, through the long detail of your letter, by not at fir&s;t acquainting me that Emma's life was &s;afe? Every paragraph I read made me tremble for the next, as I expected it to contain the period of her life and &s;ufferings.&mdash;Un|happy, much loved &s;i&s;ter! I fear they will not &s;eparately end.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding your caution, I feel the &s;tronge&s;t indignation again&s;t Sir
<PB N="235" REF="237">
James De&s;mond, and pay but little re|gard to his mere attrition, for &s;uch I con&s;ider his pre&s;ent &s;tate of humi|liation.</P>
<P>There is no palliation for his mi&s;con|duct but the weakne&s;s of his under&s;tand|ing&mdash;What a tottering foundation to build any permanent hope upon? Ex|perience may make fools cunning, but nothing can make them wi&s;e; and his reigning vice is of &s;uch a nature, that men of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, once infected with it, find it difficult to get the better of.</P>
<P>How do I lament that Emma's happi|ne&s;s is bound in his, and that he &s;hould ignorantly po&s;&s;e&s;s a trea&s;ure <Q>richer than all his tribe.</Q> I have not your calm|ne&s;s Stanley, and cannot think with pa|tience of his ca&s;ting &s;uch a pearl away&mdash;But Emma mu&s;t be made happy, and if
<PB N="236" REF="238">
my whole fortune can effect that pur|po&s;e, it will be well be&s;towed.</P>
<P>That wretched &s;coundrel, Sewell, who is now here, and whom I &s;ent for as &s;oon as I had read your letter, has offered to reduce his demand to the &s;um of five hundred pounds, which he lent Sir James, out of the money he had cheated him of, provided he is not expo&s;ed; but I refu&s;ed any terms of accommodation with him, threatened him with a pro&s;e|cution, and have publicly proclaimed him a cheat.</P>
<P>I perfectly recollect your antipathy, and my &s;ympathy towards this man; your pre&s;entiment, tho' &s;ince proved more ju&s;t, had le&s;s foundation than mine, which aro&s;e from an open, chear|ful countenance, that has always ap|peared to me the index of an hone&s;t heart; for I &s;hall never read <HI>ra&s;cal</HI> in any
<PB N="237" REF="239">
man's countenance, till his actions have rendered the characters legible&mdash;Tho' it &s;eems that, as Hamlet &s;ays, <Q>A man may &s;mile, and &s;mile, and be a villain.</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be detained here &s;ome days longer, as I have promi&s;ed to &s;tay with Mr. and Mrs. Harri&s;on till they are ready to &s;et out for the Con|tinent; but had I no engagement, I &s;hould not wi&s;h to meet Sir James De&s;|mond, till my re&s;entment towards him is &s;omewhat abated. I al&s;o think that Emma mu&s;t as yet be in too weak a &s;tate to bear even the &s;light emotion which might ari&s;e from &s;eeing me after &s;uch an incident. In the mean time I intreat you to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible means of &s;ettling Sir James De&s;mond's affairs, and for that purpo&s;e enclo&s;e you an un|limited letter of credit on my banker. The fir&s;t u&s;e I de&s;ire you to make of it
<PB N="238" REF="240">

I cannot expre&s;s what I felt at your de&s;cription of the interview be|tween her and her unnatural daughter, who&s;e infamous conduct has brought her mother's &s;ilver hairs, with &s;orrow to the grave.&mdash;Though this expre&s;&s;ion be a common one, it can never cea&s;e to be af|fecting.</P>
<P>Do not be offended with me, Stanley, for &s;aying that I am not &s;orry Lucy's feelings &s;hould be augmented, even at the expence of her vivacity.&mdash;Tender|ne&s;s &s;tands &s;econd in the catalogue of fe|male charms: mode&s;ty is its only ante|cedent, and always its companion; they are both derived from the &s;ame &s;ource, from &s;en&s;ibility; and tho&s;e &s;oft drops, which pity has engendered, add infinitely more lu&s;tre to the &s;peaking eye, than all the jewels that ever i&s;&s;ued from Golcon|da's mines, or blazed around a diadem.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="241">

<P>DEAR Stanley, I have by this po&s;t received a letter from Lady De&s;mond, which has affected me almo&s;t as much as your account of her di&s;tre&s;s, though the emotion I felt was of a different kind.&mdash;I am charmed with the virtue and good &s;en&s;e &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in her pre&s;ent unhappy &s;ituation, and my affection is encrea&s;ed by my e&s;teem for her worth.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="252">
I begin al&s;o to be &s;en&s;ible of a kind of &s;ympathy towards Sir James, from the &s;pirit he has &s;hewn in rejecting my prof|fered a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at a time when he &s;tand|&s;o much in need of it.&mdash;I could not have avoided thinking meanly of him, if he had conde&s;cended to accept of a &s;upport from an injured wife.&mdash;The &s;pirit of in|dependence is natural to men; from thence ari&s;es the only ju&s;tifiable rea&s;on that can be a&s;&s;igned for the dominion they a&s;&s;ume over the other &s;ex; and whenever they relinqui&s;h the power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them&s;elves,</P>
<Q>Hou&s;ewives &s;hould make a &s;killet of their helms.</Q>
<P>This kind of argument might appear to any one who did not know me as meant for a &s;alvo to my&s;elf, on having altered my intentions towards Emma and her family&mdash;On the contrary, my attach|ment
<PB N="251" REF="253">
to her happine&s;s and intere&s;t is &s;tronger, at this moment, than it has ever been; though I rejoice at finding that &s;he will have le&s;s occa&s;ion for pecu|niary a&s;&s;i&s;tance than either &s;he or her hu&s;band apprehend at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>For this information I am indebted to Sewell, who, though undoubtedly a knave, is willing to make a merit of di&s;|clo&s;ing the villainy of others, provided his own may go unpuni&s;hed.&mdash;On the&s;e terms he has offered to make very ma|terial di&s;coveries, and I have promi&s;ed to &s;ecure him from any legal inflictions, leaving him to be puni&s;hed <HI>only</HI> with the lo&s;s of character, and the &s;tings of his own con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Our <HI>King's evidence</HI> then has laid open a mo&s;t complicated &s;cene of wickedne&s;s, and is ready to prove that the Jew, who bought the e&s;tate on which Emma's
<PB N="252" REF="254">
jointure of five hundred pounds a year was &s;ettled, the power over which un|luckily devolved to her, by my having ne|glected to admini&s;ter to my brother, who was her &s;ole tru&s;tee, did not pay in &s;ter|ling ca&s;h above &s;ix thou&s;and for it, though the bargain was made for fifteen thou&s;and, which was much under the real value; but, in lieu of money, made Sir James accept of old goods and chat|tels, which, when &s;old, did not produce above eight hundred pounds. As this ra&s;cally u&s;urer, who by the way is only a Jew in his dealings, has ama&s;&s;ed a noble fortune by his villainy, I &s;hall have infi|nite plea&s;ure, not only in making him refund his infamous purcha&s;e, but in ex|po&s;ing him to the contempt he de&s;erves.</P>
<Q><L>O heaven, that &s;uch companions &s;hou'd&s;t unfold,</L>

<P>MY dear 'Shanacy, I am utterly undone, and have no refuge but your friend&s;hip to fly to.&mdash;You know that Mon&s;ieur Dupont has obtained a divorce, and of cour&s;e I am for ever barred from any claim to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance or &s;upport.&mdash;Wretch that I am! Why did I for&s;ake the be&s;t and worthie&s;t of men? But repentance on this &s;ubject is now too late&mdash;and I &s;hall not take up your time with unavailing lamentations.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="259">
While the &s;uir was depending, I did not perceive the lea&s;t abatement in Lord Somners fondne&s;s for me; but as &s;oon as the affair was determined, I affected to grow extremely melancholy, and more than hinted, that nothing but a matri|monial connection with him could re&s;tore my happine&s;s.&mdash;He con&s;tantly waived the &s;ubject whenever it was mentioned, and I began to think I had better appear to be &s;atisfied with my &s;ituation, than ri&s;k a quarrel that might po&s;&s;ibly end in &s;eparation, and tru&s;t to my charms and blandi&s;hments to effect my purpo&s;e at &s;ome future time.</P>
<P>The artful mon&s;ter took advantage of my apparent fondne&s;s, and one even|ing, that we unfortunately talked of that bane to my happine&s;s, your dete&s;ted &s;i&s;ter-in-law, he drew me in &s;o far, as to confe&s;s that my hatred to her aro&s;e from my love to him, and that I had
<PB N="258" REF="260">
traduced her character merely to prevent his marrying her.</P>
<P>This, you know, was a fal&s;hood, for it was more to gratify you than my&s;elf, that I at that time unju&s;tly cen&s;ured her. However, I flattered my&s;elf, that as he &s;eemed to have entirely forgotten her, he would only think of the affair in the light I wi&s;hed, and receive the ca|lumny as a proof of my love.</P>
<P>But it turned out, alas! quite other|ways.&mdash;My cunning over&s;hot the mark.&mdash;His pride appeared to be hurt at being deceived, and he wrote a letter directly to Lady Juliana's brother, Lord R&mdash;, who was in Scotland, acquaint|ing him with the means by which he had been impo&s;ed on, and intreating his and his &s;i&s;ter's forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="261">
This huff-gruff don of a nobleman, arrived in town ye&s;terday, and came directly to our hou&s;e; Lord Somners was at home, and I could hear enough of their conver&s;ation, to di&s;cover that there was a very warm altercation be|tween them.&mdash;I trembled like an a&s;pin leaf, cur&s;ed my own folly for having betrayed my&s;elf, and when Lord Som|ners came into my dre&s;&s;ing-room, I was as pale as death, and looked like a cul|prit that expected &s;entence to be pro|nounced again&s;t him.</P>

<P>Though I was &s;hocked almo&s;t to death at his indifference, I mu&s;tered up courage enough to tell him, that I could not &s;uppo&s;e him to be &s;uch a mean &s;pirited wretch, as to give up a woman who had &s;acrificed every thing to him, to &s;ave him&s;elf from Lord R&mdash;'s re|&s;entment.&mdash;He replied, that this was by no means the ca&s;e on either &s;ide, for he thought it but a flight compen&s;ation for the injuries he had done an amiable and virtuous woman, to give up one, who had made the &s;acrifice &s;he boa&s;ted, to Sir James De&s;mond at lea&s;t, if not to others.</P>
<P>I grew outrageous at his in&s;olence, but my fury had no effect upon his im|penetrable head or heart.&mdash;He certainly never loved me. He took out of his

<HEAD>LETTER LXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>LADY O'SHAUGHNASY TO MISS MORTON.</HEAD>
<P>REALLY, Mi&s;s Morton, I am quite a&s;toni&s;hed at your a&s;&s;urance, and were it not to prevent your coming, or &s;end|ing your trunks to me, I &s;hould take no notice of your extraordinary letter. How could you ever pre&s;ume that I would appear in public with a woman that has been divorced from her hu&s;|band, and lived as a kept mi&s;tre&s;s with another man? Let me tell you, Madam,
<PB N="264" REF="266">
you are extremely mi&s;taken in my cha|racter.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that on my fir&s;t coming to London, being very low &s;pirited, and having no acquaintance in town, I did conde&s;cend to &s;up with you two or three times in private, and I think I paid pretty hand&s;omely for my entertainment.&mdash;Be&s;ides you were not then divorced, and I might in charity &s;uppo&s;e, that your connection with Lord Somners was perfectly innocent.&mdash;But the matter is much too clear at pre&s;ent for Lady O'Shaughna&s;y to be &s;een with Mi&s;s Morton.&mdash;How could I, with any face, upbraid my hu&s;band for keeping an infamous woman, if I &s;hould become the companion of &s;uch a one my&s;elf?</P>
<P>And as to your making a merit to me of your traducing Lady Juliana's charac|ter, you know full well, that it was to
<PB N="265" REF="267">
gratify your own &s;pleen and jealou&s;y again&s;t her, for having deprived you of your fancied conque&s;t, Mr. Evelyn.&mdash;But in truth, Mi&s;s Morton, though I do not wi&s;h to mortify you at pre&s;ent, I am certain he never did, or could like you&mdash;But nothing can conquer &s;ome people's vanity.</P>
<P>I have been informed that Sir John O'Shaughna&s;y is at Scarborough.&mdash;It is my duty to follow him there, and I have no doubt of recovering his affec|tions.&mdash;I mention this circum&s;tance in order to prevent your bending your cour&s;e that way, as I &s;hould be &s;orry to be obliged to treat a per&s;on with con|tempt, for whom I once had a &s;mall portion of regard; and for this rea&s;on I hope you will henceforth avoid any further intercour&s;e with</P>

<P>DRIED be my Lucy's tears, and may each trace of &s;orrow, &s;he has ever felt for her unhappy friend, vani&s;h at the receipt of this, like morning dews before the ri&s;ing &s;un! No cau&s;e remains for Lucy now to weep, her &s;i&s;ter Magdalen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name Lady Juliana a&s;&s;umed with the veil.</NOTE> is well and happy.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="269">
Your letter was the harbinger of peace; I could no longer doubt of hea|ven's forgivene&s;s, when a frail mortal, like my&s;elf, looked with compa&s;&s;ion on my &s;ufferings, and thought they had atoned for all my faults. Hope, once again, illumined my &s;ad mind, and &s;tilled the beating of my anxious heart.&mdash;I dared to make my vows&mdash;From that ble&s;&s;ed hour no pang has harrowed up my &s;oul, no bur&s;ts of grief have &s;ince deformed my face&mdash;Though the &s;oft drops of penitence &s;incere will never cea&s;e to flow.</P>
<P>Yes, Lucy, I believe that I could bear to &s;ee you now, and meet your looks with firmne&s;s; yet, for your &s;ake, I would po&s;tpone the interview, 'till u&s;e has made the idea of our &s;eparation more ea&s;y to your friendly heart.&mdash;Yet let me not turn boa&s;ter, perhaps your pre&s;ence
<PB N="268" REF="270">
might recal ideas that &s;hould be ever bani&s;hed from my mind; then do not ri&s;k my pre&s;ent tranquility, but &s;trive to wean your&s;elf from the affection which you long have borne me, and think of me as a departed friend.</P>
<P>To complete my earthly happine&s;s, I have received a letter from my brother, filled with the tendere&s;t acknowledg|ments of what he calls the unlucky error, that had led him to behave unkindly to me, and the mo&s;t earne&s;t en|treaties to return and pa&s;s my days with him without controul.&mdash;Ble&s;t be the power of truth that has relieved his mind from the indignant, yet humiliat|ing &s;en&s;ation, that mu&s;t ari&s;e from the di&s;honour of a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>For my own part I never felt re&s;ent|ment to my foes, and only grieved for
<PB N="269" REF="271">
what my brother &s;uffered. I am indebt|ed to their malice, Lucy.&mdash;They meant to &s;ting my heart, but have procured its peace.&mdash;May penitence for the in|tended mi&s;chief a&s;&s;uage their own re|mor&s;e.</P>
<P>I am infinitely indebted to the amiable &s;uperior of our convent for many indul|gencies&mdash;She knew and loved my mo|ther, and has transferred that kind|ne&s;s to your friend.&mdash;From this cau&s;e, were there no other, I &s;hould be plea&s;ed with her &s;ociety; but &s;he is &s;en&s;ible, as well as good.</P>
<P>I mention this little circum&s;tance to render you more ea&s;y at my &s;eclu&s;ion from a world which has to me mo&s;t &s;urely been a world of woe.&mdash;May every happine&s;s it can afford await my tender friend and may we meet again in that

ble&s;&s;ed place, <Q>where every tear is wiped from every eye,</Q> to part no more.</P>
