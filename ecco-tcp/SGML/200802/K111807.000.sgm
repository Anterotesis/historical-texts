<HEAD>A DISSERTATION Upon the mo&s;t Celebrated <HI>Roman POETS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_OF all the Nations in the World, the <HI>Romans</HI> have mo&s;t excelled in the <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> and even, a|mong the <HI>Romans,</HI> VIR|GIL has been the mo&s;t de&s;ervedly cele|brated; from whom the ju&s;te&s;t Rules of this Art are rather to be taken, than from the dry Precepts of the Criticks. To the End, therefore, that we may the more truly a&s;certain the <HI>Beauties,</HI> and <HI>Faults,</HI> which occur among the re&s;t of the Writers of <HI>Heroic Poetry,</HI> let us 
<PB N="5" REF="6">compare them with the Style of VIR|GIL; who, if he be in any Thing de|ficient, it is, when he has &s;ometimes in his <HI>Eclogues</HI> mingled &s;uch a Purity of Style, as is not entirely agreeable with the Dialect of Shepherds; and frequently the Dignity of his Ver&s;e &s;eems no way con&s;onant to the Rural Pipe. In every Book of his <HI>Georgicks,</HI> he treats of <HI>Coun|try Affairs</HI> with an inimitable Elegancy of Style; but, above all, we are mo&s;t de|lighted with his la&s;t Book, <HI>Of the Nature of</HI> BEES; where, in a Poem on &s;o incon|&s;iderable a Subject, our Author purpo&s;e|ly affects a peculiarly &s;olemn and pomp|ous Style. In this Piece he compares the Labours of the BEES to tho&s;e of the <HI>Cyclops;</HI> and in the &s;ame lofty Numbers recounts the Skirmi&s;hes of the&s;e little <HI>In&s;ects</HI> among them&s;elves, as he does the 
<PB N="7" REF="8">Rencounters of AENEAS and TURNUS. All along, the Generals of this &s;mall Republick, the Populace, the Factions, the Cu&s;toms and Forms of Government exerci&s;ed within the narrow Limits of the <HI>Bee-hive,</HI> are de&s;cribed with an in|expre&s;&s;ible Beauty and Magnificence. Throughout the whole Work, what mo&s;tly rai&s;es our Admiration, is, that in the Per&s;uit of his Di&s;cour&s;e on Plant|ing, Grazing, and Agriculture, (wa|ving the common Forms of Speech) he &s;uits his Poetick Diction to &s;o unpolite a Theme; how, &s;eemingly depre&s;&s;ed with the Meanne&s;s of his Subject, he never &s;inks into a <HI>Plebeian</HI> Style; but the Force and Energy of his Expre&s;&s;ion are &s;o con&s;picuous, that many, too ra&s;hly indeed, have not &s;crupled to pre|fer the <HI>Georgicks</HI> to the <HI>Aeneid:</HI> But in 
<PB N="9" REF="10">a Work of this Nature, no other Parts of Poetry could be di&s;played, except an Elegance of Style and De&s;cription: In both the&s;e Ways VIRGIL has this, pe|culiar to him&s;elf, that he captivates the Soul with his wonderful Sweetne&s;s, and his De&s;criptions are as Lively, as if we had the Object placed before our Eyes.</P>
<P>In the Purity of his Style next fol|lows LUCRETIUS, who&s;e Diction, allowing for his Ob&s;oletene&s;s, and Numbers almo&s;t Pro&s;aick, may chal|lenge a Share of Prai&s;e, in tho&s;e who have any Ta&s;te of the <HI>Roman Elo|quence:</HI> For De&s;criptions however, the &s;econd Po&s;t of Honour is due to CLAU|DIAN, who has throughout, in a mo&s;t beautiful Style, interwoven his agree|able Images; faulty in this alone, that 
<PB N="11" REF="12">he expatiates upon his Subjects beyond all Decency, and frequently gives us the &s;ame Thoughts, diver&s;ified only in Expre&s;&s;ion. CLAUDIAN well knew what a Ma&s;ter he was in this Art, for on what&s;oever Topick he is engaged, he diligently &s;earches out Matter for De|&s;cription, nay mo&s;t of the Subjects he has wrote upon, are wholly &s;uch, as may be &s;een in his <HI>Prefaces,</HI> his <HI>E|clogues,</HI> his Books of the <HI>Rape of</HI> PRO|SERPINE, his <HI>Phoenix,</HI> his <HI>Porcupine,</HI> his <HI>Cramp-fi&s;h,</HI> and mo&s;t of his EPI|GRAMS.</P>
<P>OVID (like a true Courtier as he was) de&s;cribes the Affairs of <HI>Love</HI> in neat and polite Ver&s;e. In the re&s;t of his Works we meet with the more vulgar Way of Expre&s;&s;ion; for tru&s;t|ing 
<PB N="13" REF="14">to a good Genius, he was little &s;o|li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">itous about forming a more elaborate Stile: but yet, in his <HI>Metamorpho&s;es,</HI> he has Painted, in the greate&s;t Perfection, the various <HI>Changes</HI> of all Creatures, and the <HI>Transformations</HI> proceed in a mo&s;t ea&s;y and gradual manner.</P>
<P>STATIUS has frequently di&s;charged both the&s;e Requi&s;ites of a Poet, we ju&s;t now ob&s;erved; LUCAN neither, who&s;e Diction, altho' very bomba&s;t, is not enlivened either by beautiful Phra&s;es or Epithets, but comes nearer Pro&s;e than Poetry; nay, there is in him common|ly &s;uch a mean Choice of Words, as is &s;ometimes even beneath Profe it&s;elf: And although he abounds in De&s;cripti|ons, and is always making Excur&s;ions of that Kind, yet he &s;eldom fini&s;hes his 
<PB N="15" REF="16">Work as he ought, or brings his Thoughts to any Ju&s;tne&s;s of Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But now, as to STATIUS, he has given us Compo&s;itions worthy of the Envy of the be&s;t Poets. But with all his Beauties, he has greater Faults; for, in his Expre&s;&s;ion, he makes too much u&s;e of Gigantick Words; and, not con|&s;idering his Subject, mingles u&s;ele&s;s Thunder in his Numbers; Nor is he le&s;s faulty in his De&s;criptions; for, en|couraging too great a Heat, while he attempts to excel, he &s;hoots beyond his Mark, and &s;wells unnaturally. Of both which Extreams CLAUDIAN is too often guilty.</P>
<P>And now, &s;ince there have been ma|ny Pieces written, and tho&s;e of Note, 
<PB N="17" REF="18">on the Subject of VIRGIL's <HI>Aeneis,</HI> (and le&s;s notice is taken of the Poetry of STATIUS and LUCAN) to who&s;e Productions only the <HI>Latins</HI> allow the Title of <HI>Epick Poetry.</HI> As to LUCAN, it has been often di&s;puted, whether <HI>Hi|&s;tory,</HI> of which the <HI>Phar&s;alia</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, be a proper Subject for an <HI>Heroick Po|em.</HI> For the Deci&s;ion of this Point, we mu&s;t enquire into the true Nature of <HI>Heroick Poetry,</HI> which our Country|man, the Lord BACON, has admira|bly de&s;cribed in his Treati&s;e of <HI>The Ad|vancement of Learning.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&mdash;[As for <HI>Narrative Poe&s;ie,</HI> or, if you plea&s;e, <HI>Heroical,</HI> (&s;o you under&s;tand it of the Matter, not of the Ver&s;e) it &s;eems to be rai&s;ed altogether from a noble Foundation, which makes much for the Dignity of Man's Na|ture. 
<PB N="19" REF="20">For, &s;eeing this &s;en&s;ible World is, in Dignity, inferior to the Soul of Man, <HI>Poe&s;ie</HI> &s;eems to endow human Nature with that which <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> de|nies; and to give Satisfaction to the Mind, with, at lea&s;t, the Shadow of Things, where the Sub&s;tance cannot be had. For, if the Matter be thorough|ly con&s;idered, a &s;trong Argument may be drawn from <HI>Poe&s;ie,</HI> that a more &s;tately greatne&s;s of Things, a more perfect Order, and a more beautiful Variety delights the Soul of Man, than any Way can be found in Nature &s;ince the <HI>Fall.</HI> Wherefore, &s;eeing the Acts and Events, which are the Subject of true <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> are not of that Amplitude, as to content the Mind of Man, <HI>Poe&s;ie</HI> is ready at Hand to feign Acts more <HI>Heroical:</HI> 
<PB N="21" REF="22">Becau&s;e <HI>True Hi&s;tory</HI> reports the Suc|ce&s;&s;es of Bu&s;ine&s;s not proportionable to the Merit of Virtues and Vices, <HI>Poe&s;ie</HI> corrects it, and pre&s;ents Events and Fortunes according to De&s;ert, and according to the Law of Provi|dence: Becau&s;e <HI>True Hi&s;tory,</HI> thro' the frequent Satiety and Simili|tude of Things, works a Di&s;ta&s;te and Mi&s;pri&s;ion in the Mind of Man; <HI>Po|e&s;ie</HI> cheereth and refre&s;heth the Soul, chaunting Things rare, and various, and full of Vici&s;&s;itudes. So as <HI>Poe&s;ie</HI> &s;erveth and conferreth to Delectation, Magnanimity, and Morality; and therefore it may &s;eem de&s;ervedly to have &s;ome Participation of Divine|ne&s;s, becau&s;e it accommodates its Images and De&s;criptions to the ut|mo&s;t De&s;ire and Wi&s;h of the Soul, 
<PB N="23" REF="24">not &s;ubjecting the Mind to Things or Facts, as <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> do."]</Q> From whence it is &s;ufficiently manife&s;t, that <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Epick Poetry</HI> are by no means proper Companions; and there|fore, that LUCAN has very much failed in his principal Subject: The five Heroes, who make the greate&s;t Figure in his Poem, are CAESAR, POMPEY, BRUTUS, CATO, and CICERO; each of them indeed as di&s;tingui&s;hable in their Lives, as to be lamented in their Deaths; Men, who&s;e Virtues, allowing for the Frailties of Human Nature, came neare&s;t to that Pitch of Heroick Perfection, which other Poets have fal&s;ely attributed to their Heroes. LUCAN every where &s;narls at CAE|SAR, and pa&s;&s;ionately e&s;pou&s;es POM|PEY's Intere&s;t; but mo&s;t of all, cele|brates 
<PB N="25" REF="26">the Characters of BRUTUS and CATO, for that Spirit of <HI>Stoici&s;m,</HI> which he had equally imbibed with them: And, indeed, mo&s;t of the Faults objected to LUCAN, are rather to be imputed to this Kind of Philo&s;ophy. From whence &s;prung that boundle&s;s Vein of Wit, and that peculiar Affecta|tion of a lofty Style; which, like that Sect of Men, he always delighted in, and therefore gives the Preference ra|ther to Great, than Good Actions. And upon this Account, in rai&s;ing the Pa&s;&s;i|ons, (that mo&s;t excellent Part of Poe|try) he &s;ucceeded but ill; becau&s;e, up|on the Principles of his Philo&s;ophy, the Pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves were accounted as ab&s;olutely unlawful. To confirm this, (pa&s;&s;ing by many others) I will pro|duce but one In&s;tance: After CAESAR 
<PB N="27" REF="28">had obtained the Victory over POM|FEY, in the Battle of <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> LU|CAN certainly, (if he had enlarged on any Circum&s;tance foreign to Hi&s;tory it &s;elf) &s;hould, upon &s;o remarkable an Occa&s;ion, have lamented the unde&s;erved Fate of POMPEY, in the mo&s;t mournful Strain; e&s;pecially &s;ince he pays &s;o high a Deference to him throughout his whole Work; or, at lea&s;t, (as there was an open Field for Grief) he &s;hould have introduced POMPEY, either complaining of <HI>Rome</HI>'s lo&s;t Liberty, the Death of his Friends, or his own Mis|fortunes. But LUCAN is &s;o far from rai&s;ing the Pa&s;&s;ions to this ju&s;t Heighth, that he warmly advi&s;es POMPEY (when vanqui&s;hed, he retires from the Field of Action) to commi&s;erate the Condition of his Conqueror CAESAR, 
<PB N="29" REF="30">becau&s;e he had not won the Day, but by unju&s;tifiable Methods.<Q><L>Don't you rejoice that your &s;uperiour Foes</L>
<L>Have &s;natch'd you from a Scene of future Woes?</L>
<L>That ble&s;t in Exile you e&s;cape the Sight</L>
<L>Of Armies bleeding in dome&s;tick Fight?</L>
<L>Behold each River drags her tardy Flood,</L>
<L>Choak'd up with Carnage and di&s;tain'd with Blood;</L>
<L>Your <HI>Victor-Sire</HI> with pitying Eyes &s;urvey,</L>
<L>Nor envy him the Fortune of the Day.</L>
<L>How &s;hall he enter <HI>Rome</HI> devoid of Shame,</L>
<L>Who on the publick Ruins builds his Name?</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">Who can bear to hear the Poet Phi|lo&s;ophizing in this ridiculous Manner? As if POMPEY, a Man in Years, an Exile, Mi&s;erable, and Vanqui&s;hed, &s;hould have any Concern upon him for the Crimes of his Conqueror: He ought to have been very much &s;toicized indeed, who, de&s;poiled of all the Goods of Fortune, could place the Sum of his Felicity in meer naked Virtue. But none of the Poets have touched this Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Grief</HI> like VIRGIL. The Generality of other Writers, when they attempt to move their Readers, offend in this Point, that they are too prolix in &s;pinning out their Complaints, and think their Flood of Tears inex|hau&s;tible; or el&s;e, while they labour to expre&s;s the Greatne&s;s of their Geni|us, in the Profu&s;ene&s;s of their Ver&s;e, ra|ther 
<PB N="33" REF="34">rai&s;e our Admiration at the Flow|ing of their Numbers, than excite our Pity in the Cata&s;trophe of their Story. VIRGIL has carefully avoided both the&s;e Extreams, and dre&s;&s;es his Images of Sorrow in their Native Simplicity; and where-ever he touches upon the Pathetick, he does it with a ma&s;terly quickne&s;s: For, according to CI|CERO, <HI>Our expre&s;&s;ions of Grief ought to be &s;hort and conci&s;e, becau&s;e our Tears quickly dry up, and it is unnatural to detain either an Auditor or Reader in too long a Su&s;pen&s;ion of Grief.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to STATIUS, his Spirit is indeed lofty and a&s;piring, to which while he gives too great a Loo&s;e, he runs into Bomba&s;t, and to his Poetry often adds u&s;ele&s;s &s;ounding Words. The Subject of his <HI>Thebais</HI> 
<PB N="35" REF="36">&s;eems indeed &s;uited to the Barbarity of his Genius, but is beneath the Dignity of an Heroick Poem. For neither E|TEOCLES, POLYNICES, nor TYDEUS, who&s;e Actions are record|ed in this Poem, have any thing in them, except their Fortitude, agreeable to Heroes: Nay, throughout the whole Piece, there are no Examples produc'd, unle&s;s of Per&s;ons infamous for the mo&s;t flagitious Enormities, &s;uch as Parricide, Treachery, Cruelty, and Revenge; while, on the contrary, every Thing Prai&s;e-worthy &s;hines bright in VIR|GIL's Heroes; and in the Per&s;on of AENEAS we have plac'd before our Eyes an In&s;tance of con&s;ummate Piety towards the GOD's, his Son, his Wife, his Friends, and his Father. The Epi|thets of STATIUS are generally 
<PB N="37" REF="38">forced and very metaphorical, while &s;uch Properties are a&s;cribed to Inani|mates, as really only belong to Animals. In the Choice of his Words, and fre|quently in his Metaphors, he is fol|lowed by CLAUDIAN with the utmo&s;t Elegance. VIRGIL is &s;paring in both the&s;e Particulars; STATIUS abounds much with Similitudes, in which he &s;eems to imitate VIRGIL; but in this In&s;tance LUCAN had had better Suc|ce&s;s, if he had hit upon the proper Me|dium: But while VIRGIL &s;toops down to the humble Subjects of <HI>Bees, Ants,</HI> and other &s;uch like delightful Themes of Nature; on the other Hand, LUCAN bellows out nothing but Stories of <HI>Oaks</HI> &s;plit by Lightening, <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> and the World's <HI>Confla|gration.</HI> Let this, in &s;hort, &s;uffice, 
<PB N="39" REF="40">ob&s;ervable, concerning the Writers of Heroic Poetry, in it&s;elf New, and never before taken Notice of.</P>
<P>Something now remains to be &s;aid of the <HI>Satyri&s;ts,</HI> among whom whe|ther JUVENAL or HORACE have mo&s;t Right to the <HI>Bays,</HI> it is dfficult to determine; for it has been long a Di&s;pute among the Learned, whether that Keenne&s;s and Bitterne&s;s of Expre&s;|&s;ion with which JUVENAL has armed his <HI>Satires,</HI> or HORACE's more joco&s;e <HI>Lampoons</HI> are mo&s;t agreeable to the End of SATIRE. Now that we may give a clearer Deci&s;ion on this Head, a few Things mu&s;t be premi&s;ed. HO|RACE bears, to this Day, an ill Cha|racter for the Loo&s;ene&s;s of his Con|duct in Life. JUVENAL was a rigid 
<PB N="41" REF="42">Practi&s;er of Virtue. The one was con|ver&s;ant in the mo&s;t perfectly polite Court of AUGUSTUS; the other lived in the Dregs of DOMITIAN's Time; and therefore both the&s;e Poets accom|modated their Writings to the Manners of the different Ages they lived in: For HORACE is intirely upon the ludicrous, and per&s;ues not &s;o much the Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s of the Times, as the ridiculous Fopperies of &s;ome particular Cour|tiers; for had he attempted to correct the&s;e Trifles with Severity, he had not mi&s;&s;ed of being laughed at: But JU|VENAL la&s;hes the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Crimes prevalent in his Time, and complains of Enormities which one would be a&s;hamed to mention; and nothing le&s;s than the highe&s;t Re&s;entmemt of Soul, Ardency of Expre&s;&s;ion, and Sharpne&s;s 
<PB N="43" REF="44">of Speech, could be an equal Match to Crimes &s;o notorious; though whenever he de&s;cends to be <HI>joco&s;e,</HI> we frequently meet with the Plea&s;antry of HO|RACE. Both of them, allowing for the different Manner of their Writing, are perfect Ma&s;ters in their &s;everal Ways; in the one, the <HI>Ridicule</HI> appears better than the <HI>Severe,</HI> in the other, the <HI>Severe</HI> better than the <HI>Ridicule.</HI></P>
<P>The re&s;t of HORACE's Pieces are &s;o admirable, that they exceed our high|e&s;t Encomiums, and are not only beyond our Di&s;like, but above our Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Dramatic <HI>Poets,</HI> PLAUTUS and TERENCE bear away the Bell, who&s;e Plots, Turns, and Elegancy of Style, are &s;o well known, that nothing New can be &s;aid upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">As ro SENECA, Mankind have had different Opinions of him; &s;ome have ranked him with the be&s;t <HI>Tragoe|dians,</HI> others have &s;unk him below the wor&s;t. He certainly had a great Ge|nius, an elegant and conci&s;e Way of Expre&s;&s;ion; he abounds with &s;mart Turns, which always &s;avour much of that Stoici&s;m of which he was a Fol|lower, upon which Account he has al|ways been e&s;teemed by tho&s;e who have had little or no Ta&s;te of <HI>Dramatic Poetry;</HI> but then if we con&s;ider him as &s;uch, his Tragedies are throughout too elaborate; and this, to pa&s;s by his other Faults, &s;eems peculiarly SENECA's, that he makes all his Actors (without any Regard to the Characters they bear) talk in the &s;ame Strain; all of 
<PB N="47" REF="48">them inculcate rigid philo&s;ophical <HI>Dog|mata,</HI> and &s;uch Morality as is rather fit for the Schools of the Stoicks, than the <HI>Roman</HI> Theatre: For with him the King and the Slave &s;trut in the &s;ame Buskin; nay, you may perceive the Nur&s;e her&s;elf deeply tinged with the Principles of Stoici&s;m.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Epigrammati&s;ts,</HI> MAR|TIAL and CLAUDIAN have bore the greate&s;t Reputaion; the fir&s;t, for the &s;evere Point in the Clo&s;e of his <HI>Epi|grams,</HI> and the peculiar Jingle of his Words. The other, for di&s;per&s;ing the Poignancy of his Wit throughout his <HI>Epigrams,</HI> and that in the mo&s;t beauti|ful <HI>Latin</HI> Phra&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">The re&s;t of the <HI>lower Cla&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets creep &s;o low in their Numbers, that they are beneath the Notice either of GODS or Men: And tho' we may now and then di&s;cover in the affected Songs and Sonnets of CATULLUS, and the ob&s;cene POETRY of TIBULLUS and PROPERTIUS, &s;ome not di&s;agree|able Pieces, yet it is not worth our while to rake the <HI>Dunghills</HI> for the &s;ake of the JEWELS.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY UPON THE <HI>Roman</HI> ELEGIAC POETS.</HEAD>
<P>_I Have often <HI>wondered,</HI> that, among &s;o Many, who have Bu&s;ied or Diverted Them&s;elves in <HI>Tran&s;la|ting</HI> the Ancient <HI>Cla&s;&s;ick</HI> POETS, &s;o Few have thought the <HI>Wri|ters</HI> of ELEGY Worthy their Pains, or Amu&s;ement. I cannot but Believe that, 
<PB N="53" REF="54"><HI>The&s;e</HI> have &s;ucceeded as happily in their Way, as the <HI>Others,</HI> and that They may be Read with no le&s;s <HI>Advantage</HI> than <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI> For my own Part, I can affirm, that when at any time my Mind hath been ruffled by &s;ome <HI>peevi&s;h Accident</HI> or <HI>Di&s;appointment,</HI> I have always found my temper &s;ooner Com|po&s;ed by taking a Turn with <HI>TIBUL|LUS</HI> in my Hand, than by having re|cour&s;e to the <HI>Le&s;&s;ons</HI> of PHILOSO|PHY, or the <HI>Precepts</HI> of DIVINES. Whatever is very <HI>&s;olemn,</HI> carrieth with it, I don't know how, &s;omewhat of <HI>Con&s;traint:</HI> And it frequently happens by an unlucky Di&s;po&s;ition either in the <HI>Pupil,</HI> or the <HI>Preacher,</HI> that <HI>Tho&s;e &s;e|verer</HI> Kinds of <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> (I &s;peak not This with the lea&s;t Irreverence) &s;erve rather to <HI>Puni&s;h,</HI> than <HI>Reform</HI> Us.

<PB N="55" REF="56">is perhaps no Difficult Matter to <HI>Con|vince</HI> One of the <HI>Rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of This or That Action, but the Secret lies in <HI>Engaging</HI> One in the <HI>Practice.</HI> It is a <HI>Memorable Sentence</HI> of a <HI>Celebra|ted</HI> MORALIST <HI>This,</HI><Q REND="inline"><L>Virtus e&s;t vitium fugere, &amp; Sapientia prima</L>

<P><PB N="57" REF="58">WHILST <HI>Our poor tottering</HI> BARK continues in This Uncertain <HI>Voyage</HI> of Life, and is &s;o often kept out at <HI>Sea</HI> in <HI>rough</HI> and <HI>&s;tormy Weather,</HI> far from the &s;ight of any <HI>Ho&s;pitable Shoar,</HI> the SOUL, its PASSENGER, cannot &s;ure but feel a <HI>mighty Satisfaction</HI> ari&s;ing within, when &s;he finds Her&s;elf afterwads <HI>Steal|ing,</HI> as it were, away under <HI>&s;moother Cour&s;es,</HI> and born <HI>gently</HI> down the <HI>Tide</HI> of TENDERNESS in <HI>&s;oft</HI> and <HI>ea&s;ie Gales</HI> of PASSION.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>Charm</HI> in VERSE that never fails <HI>agreeably</HI> to Affect a <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>rightly plac'd:</HI> And there is, in my Opinion, &s;omething <HI>peculiarly mo|ving</HI> in the VERSES of That <HI>Good-natu|red Cla&s;s</HI> of POETS <HI>CATULLUS, TI|BULLUS, PROPERTIUS,</HI> and <HI>OVID.</HI> 
<PB N="59" REF="60">There are but <HI>Few Pieces</HI> of <HI>CATUL|LUS,</HI> it is true, that can &s;trictly be ranked among <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> of the ELEGIAC ORDER: But whenever HE doth Touch upon the <HI>&s;ofter Subjects</HI> of HU|MANITY, his <HI>Sentiments</HI> have the ut|mo&s;t <HI>Propriety</HI> and <HI>Delicacy;</HI> and therefore I could not but mention HIM among <HI>His Companions.</HI> They were, <HI>All Four,</HI> Men of <HI>Family</HI> and <HI>Conditi|on</HI> in their Country.
