<P>THE <HI>following ob&s;ervations were ha&s;tily put to|gether, in con&s;equence of</HI> Mr. GILBERT's <HI>late motion in the Hou&s;e of Commons for a revival of his Bill.&mdash;The writer having &s;een no other pamphlet on the &s;ubject, may probably have been anticipated in &s;ome of his remarks.&mdash;His name would not have been prefixed to this &s;hort letter, but to obviate the impropriety of oppo&s;ing an avowed plan, by an anonymous publi|cation.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CURSORY REMARKS, &amp;c. IN A LETTER TO <HI>T. GILBERT, E&s;q.</HI> M. P.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>THESE pages are addre&s;&s;ed to you Sir, as the mover of a Bill in Parliament, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>for the better Relief, and Employment of the Poor,</HI></Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. They contain objections to your plan, as too &s;peculative in its principle&mdash;and too dangerous in the experiment it propo&s;es.&mdash;</P>
<P>The few remarks that here occur in defence of our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of Poor Laws&mdash;are founded on practical ob&s;ervation. If they contribute but in a &s;mall degree to the general information which the &s;ubject at this time requires, the purpo&s;e of the writer will be completely an&s;wered.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
Your bill is profe&s;&s;edly de&s;igned for the&s;e im|portant ends, viz.<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>To &s;ecure a more comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the poor, and indigent.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>To encourage, and promote indu&s;try throughout the lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety: and</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>To alleviate the encrea&s;ing burdens of parochial taxes.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To effect which, you require, that the direction of the Poor throughout the kingdom, &s;hould be taken out of the hands of <HI>Pari&s;h Officers,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tices of the Peace</HI>&mdash;and the management be in future transferred to

Whether this e&s;&s;ential part of the public &s;ervice may be be&s;t executed&mdash;by the old laws &s;omewhat modified&mdash;or your plan, &s;ubver&s;ive of the whole antient code,&mdash;&s;hall be the &s;hort que&s;tion be|tween us.&mdash;</P>
<P>Your plan appears to me objectionable as a ma|chine too various, and complex in the movements required.&mdash;But fir&s;t it would be right to examine the con&s;tituent parts. I &s;hall take them as they ari&s;e in your bill.</P>

<HEAD>COMMISSIONERS.</HEAD>
<P>Were the principle of the bill unexceptionable,&mdash;the parliamentary appointment of the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ion|ers, merely to divide Counties into Di&s;tricts, would be liable to no material objection.</P>

<HEAD>DISTRICT COMMITTEE.</HEAD>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over the endle&s;s nui&s;ances of the Magi&s;trates taking polls in the &s;everal Di&s;tricts&mdash;an election of this Committee by <HI>ballot,</HI> carries the impropriety of &s;uch an appointment upon the face of it. If the office of a Di&s;trict Committee-man prove a de&s;irable one, per&s;ons of &s;uperior influence will find no diffi|culty
<PB N="4" REF="6">
in engro&s;&s;ing &s;uch power within them&s;elves.&mdash;On the other hand, if it turn out unprofitable, and trouble&s;ome, they will take care to a man, not to be elected, and in that ca&s;e none but the ignorant and incapable will be cho&s;en.&mdash;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>DISTRICT AGENT.</HEAD>
<P>This Officer to be elected by the fir&s;t <HI>Di&s;trict Comlmittee,</HI> will of cour&s;e be the choice of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive pari&s;hes, &s;ending a plurality of voices to the &s;aid Committee.&mdash;The &s;mall pari&s;hes,&mdash;dragged reluctantly into the corporation&mdash;mu&s;t con&s;equently be at the mercy of the larger throughout every Di&s;trict.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding all the parade of various Committees, the &s;ole government of the Di&s;trict would center in this &s;ame Agent. He would be ve&s;ted with &s;uch full, and ab&s;olute authority by your bill, that he is not even required to make any return of his examination of the three years accounts,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"unle&s;s to HIM there &s;hall APPEAR any omi&s;&s;ion, or mi&s;repre&s;entation."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In all matters of doubt and difficulty,&mdash;indeed,&mdash;he MAY con&s;ult any member or members of the <HI>Di&s;trict Committee</HI> near him, and act under his, or their advice, till the next Committee meeting."</Q>&mdash;But how few <HI>doubts</HI> a man will be troubled with, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch powers,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
may readily be conceived.&mdash;He is further authori&s;ed to relieve paupers at home, or &s;end them to the workhou&s;e, as he may think proper: the Di&s;trict Committee will therefore erect your workhou&s;es at a con&s;iderable expence to little or no purpo&s;e, &s;hould their Agent deem it more advi&s;eable to admini&s;ter re|lief pretty generally to paupers at their own hou&s;es.&mdash;Indeed the <HI>di&s;cretionary power</HI> to be ve&s;ted in this man throughout, may be directed by him, &s;o as to clog every wheel of your plan at his plea&s;ure. But even admitting him di&s;po&s;ed to do what is right;&mdash;in ca&s;es of difficulty&mdash;and many &s;uch mu&s;t daily occur&mdash;how do you direct him to act?&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He mu&s;t apply to the <HI>Di&s;trict Committee</HI> for in&s;tructions:"</Q>&mdash;true&mdash;but &s;uch Committee may not meet for a month; and after this reference to them, the matter mu&s;t be tried further back to the <HI>County Committee,</HI> who will not a&s;&s;emble for a fortnight longer; and even then a &s;ufficient number of members may not attend to form a board!&mdash;What mu&s;t be the ultimatum of all this?&mdash;The <HI>Agent</HI> will become COMPTROLLER GE|NERAL of the Poor throughout his Di&s;trict, or leave the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the indigent, and the intere&s;ts of the pari&s;hioners, to the hand of chance to regulate!</P>
<P>Should any re&s;i&s;tance be made to the authority of this officer, the bill points out no mode of redre&s;s; it is probable therefore, that the neighbouring magi&s;trate
<PB N="6" REF="8">
mu&s;t in this in&s;tance, be called upon for his aid, to enforce this novel &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence.&mdash;But after all, what APPEAL is left to the unfortunate pauper, under the probable tyranny of his new ta&s;k-ma&s;ter? Here we are left totally in the dark.&mdash;You will hardly give &s;uch appellant juri&s;diction to the Magi&s;trates, thus to offend the delicacy of the new created powers. Is the oppre&s;&s;ed object then to &s;earch for redre&s;s, perhaps for <HI>bread,</HI> through the perplexing mazes of <HI>Di&s;trict Agents&mdash;Di&s;trict Committees</HI>&mdash;and <HI>County Committees?</HI>&mdash;This would amount to little &s;hort of an ab&s;olute prohibition of ju&s;tice; and therefore, you Sir, can be&s;t explain, by what mode you mean this appeal to be &s;ecured.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OVERSEERS.</HEAD>
<P>Your idea of electing <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> with a &s;alary, I cannot deem advi&s;eable. In that ca&s;e it will always become an object with the mo&s;t powerful pari&s;hioner to command the office, either for him&s;elf, or his de|pendent. The objection to the pre&s;ent mode of appointment by the Magi&s;trates, in parochial ro|tation, you &s;tate to be, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"becau&s;e no regard is thus paid to the qualification of the per&s;ons nomi|nated."</Q>&mdash;Do you conceive Sir, that your <HI>elective</HI> mode will le&s;&s;en the evil?&mdash;I am apprehen&s;ive it
<PB N="7" REF="9">
may have a contrary effect.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The office of <HI>Over|&s;eer,</HI>"</Q> you &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is proverbially a burthen on tho&s;e, who are &s;o unfortunate as to be liable to it."</Q>&mdash;It might have been &s;o formerly, but the ca&s;e is ma|terially altered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the la&s;t Mid&s;ummer Quarter Se&s;&s;ions for ESSEX, a &s;ub&s;tantial farmer ab&s;urdly appealed again&s;t the Ju&s;tices' appoint|ment of two Over&s;eers, from an extreme anxiety to &s;erve the office him&s;elf.</NOTE>. Con&s;iderable &s;ums are now rai&s;ed by the increa&s;e of rates; the expenditure of the&s;e, gives a kind of local patronage, which men &s;eem every day more de&s;irous of obtaining. Indeed this part of your propo&s;ition is done away in the &s;ame page of your <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI> [p. 12,] by your own refutation.&mdash;You have no &s;ooner &s;tated, that Over&s;eers are ap|pointed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>again&s;t their will,</HI>"</Q> than you thus inva|lidate the a&s;&s;ertion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am afraid many of the&s;e officers [<HI>Over&s;eers</HI>] are &s;uch, as are <HI>&s;tudious to obtain their &s;ituations,</HI> in order to convert them to their own advantage, or that of their friends."</Q></P>
<P>Be this as it may, as executive in&s;truments only, under the magi&s;tracy&mdash;their proper &s;tation&mdash;the pre&s;ent mode of appointment is evidently the mo&s;t prudent.</P>
<P>But with what grace would the Over&s;eer, elected by your plan for his extreme <HI>re&s;pectability,</HI> &s;ubmit
<PB N="8" REF="10">
to be the meer runner of the Di&s;trict Agent? Few men of ordinary &s;pirit would bend to &s;o &s;ervile a degradation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Each Over&s;eer,"</Q> you &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is to be watchful within his pari&s;h, but the Di&s;trict Agent is to be awake to the nece&s;&s;ities of the whole Di&s;trict. <HI>Does any one &s;tand in need of relief? Does any want employment? Has an indu&s;trious man met with an accident that has di&s;abled him from working? Are children grown too old to be any longer kept in idlene&s;s? Has any vagrant introduced him&s;elf into the pari&s;h, and become an annoyance by begging, or a cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, by appearing unemployed? The Over&s;eer is to make repre&s;entation to the Di&s;trict Agent.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the bounden duties of the <HI>Over&s;eer,</HI> according to the laws now in force, except the &s;ervile part of the office&mdash;the repre&s;entation to the Di&s;trict Agent.&mdash;And do you really believe, Sir, that this reference on every circum&s;tance that may ari&s;e, occa&s;ioning endle&s;s trouble, would facilitate the de&s;ired redre&s;s?&mdash;Suppo&s;ing the Agent even con|&s;tantly re&s;ident within his Di&s;trict,&mdash;what unavoid|able confu&s;ion and expence mu&s;t attend the re|peated, and often fruitle&s;s journies and enquiries, by various Over&s;eers, after this individual Agent, in order that he may inve&s;tigate their re&s;pective com|plaints!
<PB N="9" REF="11">
&mdash;In a word, giving both Over&s;eer and Agent full credit for the true&s;t zeal, and be&s;t in|tentions in the di&s;charge of their duty, I think it would be found impo&s;&s;ible for them to execute, what your bill &s;eems to require at their hands.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>COUNTY COMMITTEE.</HEAD>
<P>This Committee, with qualifications equal to that of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> is to be elected by ballot&mdash;and &s;eems intended as a board of general controul, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"liable to a penalty of 10l. each for non-attendance, unle&s;s in ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, or &s;ome unavoidable accident!"</Q></P>
<P>You &s;eem, Sir, to build much on the &s;uperin|tendence of your plan, being thus ve&s;ted in the prin|cipal gentlemen of the county. Here likewi&s;e, I fear, you would experience a di&s;appointment.&mdash;You cannot but have ob&s;erved, with what extreme reluct|ance country gentlemen attach them&s;elves to public bu&s;ine&s;s. To make their appearance at a &s;ummer A&s;&s;izes, or an occa&s;ional Quarter Se&s;&s;ions, is generally the utmo&s;t extent of their county exertions. As a proof of this, I need only in&s;tance, the neglected Commi&s;&s;ions of Turnpikes, Sewers, &amp;c.&mdash;Under the dread therefore of being dragged into a dry de|tail
<PB N="10" REF="12">
of unintelligible accounts, and complex items of parochial &s;tatements,&mdash;the chief canvas of gen|tlemen on this occa&s;ion, would be to <HI>avoid</HI> the honor of being elected to &s;o trouble&s;ome an office, which mu&s;t &s;ubject them to a heavy penalty for non-at|tendance upon its tedious duties.&mdash;Hence it evi|dently follows, that the whole controuling power of this, like that of the Di&s;trict Committees, mu&s;t &s;oon fall into the hands of a few intere&s;ted <HI>Agents,</HI> who would of cour&s;e direct the whole in a manner that might be&s;t an&s;wer their own &s;ini&s;ter views.</P>
<P>If the errors be thus evident, as I contend, in the formation of the parts, how will the whole of &s;o com|plicated a machine be put into any effectual motion? In the numberle&s;s ob&s;tructions which will ari&s;e, you mu&s;t explore through &s;uch a variety of ill-according movements, that I fear you would often di&s;cover the cau&s;e of impediment, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the power of removing it.</P>
<P>Indeed if no objection lay to your plan on the &s;core of its impracticability&mdash;a man of your acknow|ledged probity mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to pay &s;ome con|&s;ideration to the means by which it would be accom|pli&s;hed.&mdash;And &s;urely he mu&s;t &s;hrink from the ta&s;k, when he &s;ound, that it could not po&s;&s;ibly be effected, but by obtruding upon the peaceful &s;cenes
<PB N="11" REF="13">
of retired life, the baneful feuds of party &s;pirit&mdash;and annually involving every County-Di&s;trict, and Pari&s;h, in all the intrigues, and riots of con|te&s;ted elections!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="summary">
<P>Tho&s;e which I have conci&s;ely &s;tated, appear to me the mo&s;t &s;triking objections to which your bill is liable.&mdash;Summed up, they amount to this&mdash;that your plan departs too widely, and wildly, from the &s;implicity of our e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem of Poor Laws&mdash;multiplying, rather than dimini&s;hing the difficulties of redre&s;s!</P>

<HEAD>MODIFICATION, AND STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF THE POOR LAWS, <HI>ALREADY ENACTED.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>I FLATTER my&s;elf, I &s;hall have no great difficulty in proving, that, by a trifling modi|fication, and &s;pirited enforcement of the exi&s;ting Laws, the three great objects of our enquiry may be completely effected.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Di&s;cretionary Power,</HI> which Over&s;eers have too long been &s;uffered to exerci&s;e, contrary to every
<PB N="14" REF="15">
principle of ju&s;tice and policy,&mdash;the alarming in|crea&s;e of paupers, as well as poors rates, may fairly be a&s;cribed.&mdash;All the grievances on this &s;ubject, now crying aloud for redre&s;s, will be found to ari&s;e from &s;ome one or other of the following cau&s;es, viz.</P>
<P>From Over&s;eers permitting idle, and di&s;or|derly per&s;ons to remain, after they find they have illegally obtruded them&s;elves into their &s;everal pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>From &s;ettled inhabitants being &s;uffered to grow &s;lothful, and live without the vi&s;ible means of gaining their bread.</P>
<P>From the neglect of Over&s;eers in not &s;eeing the children of paupers early brought up to proper habits of indu&s;try.</P>
<P>From the partial i&s;&s;uing of Pari&s;h Certificates.</P>
<P>From wanton, and capricious removals.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
From groundle&s;s appeals to the General Quarter Se&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>From the wanton expenditure of pari&s;h money in &s;earching after paupers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>From unfair rates of partial a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, and an|nexing charges thereto, not connected with the ac|counts of the poor.</P>
<P>In all the particulars above &s;tated, the Over&s;eer will be found almo&s;t invariably to exerci&s;e his own di&s;cretion, from the pre&s;ent difficulty of puni&s;hing him for any mal-conduct.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In many ca&s;es, Over&s;eers are enabled to &s;et the vague au|thority of the Magi&s;trate at defiance.</NOTE> A con&s;iderable &s;hare of the poor are rendered helple&s;s, and the &s;tate is deprived of their indu&s;try, by the &s;hameful negli|gence of pari&s;h officers. It is high time, therefore, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of their di&s;cretionary power, and hold them up to a &s;trict di&s;charge of their real duty, by <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">To be paid to the informer on conviction of the offending officer.</NOTE>fines the mo&s;t exemplary.</P>
<P>For the three fir&s;t articles, containing <HI>neglect of office,</HI> the penalties to which an Over&s;eer might be made &s;ubject, would &s;oon operate as an effectual
<PB N="16" REF="17">
preventive. As to the latter, which con&s;titute the heavy articles of <HI>expenditure,</HI> the&s;e, in my opinion, might ea&s;ily be guarded again&s;t.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>CERTIFICATES</HEAD>
<P>Contribute very much to the cro&s;s-grained di&s;|putes between different parties:&mdash;they &s;hould either be granted generally, or totally aboli&s;hed. Some pari&s;hes make it a rule not to i&s;&s;ue them; this oc|ca&s;ions many an indu&s;trious man to be removed from a place where he has long gained better wages by his labor, than he could earn in his own &s;ettle|ment. Other pari&s;hes, with more tenderne&s;s, &s;el|dom refu&s;e to certify their poor, and therefore are di&s;appointed when they meet not with the &s;ame treatment in return. But Over&s;eers thus indemnified, care not to what expence they run the pari&s;h cer|tifying, in ca&s;es of illne&s;s, &amp;c. This in a great mea&s;ure accounts for the reluctance often &s;hewn in granting &s;uch certificates. Though much may be urged on the humane &s;ide of the que&s;tion, the granting certificates is certainly productive of great public expence, and numberle&s;s litigations; and therefore, the general good &s;eems to require that they &s;hould in future be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="17" REF="18">
<HEAD>REMOVALS.</HEAD>
<P>Every per&s;on obtruding him&s;elf into any pari&s;h, not being able to give a proper and &s;atisfactory ac|count of him&s;elf, and not departing thence within a certain limited time, after due notice given him by the Over&s;eer, or Con&s;table, &s;hould be deemed a va|grant, and be &s;ummarily puni&s;hed accordingly.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on, whether &s;ingle or married, who has been permitted, openly, to re&s;ide forty days &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively in any pari&s;h, without receiving due no|tice to depart from it, &s;hould be deemed a &s;ettled inhabitant thereof; and the Over&s;eer be adjudged to pay a certain fine, in aid of the poor-rates, for &s;uch neglect of his office. Some provi&s;ion of this kind might &s;timulate the Over&s;eer, to what is &s;o much wanting, an early di&s;charge of this impor|tant part of his duty. At pre&s;ent, from the di&s;cre|tionary power which enables him to remove the in|truding pauper, at his lei&s;ure, the place of &s;ettlement from various circum&s;tances, becomes doubtful: and hence ari&s;e the charges of removal, with the ad|ditional expence of defending it, whether it prove well, or ill founded.</P>
<P>The baneful effects of <HI>vagrancy,</HI> might in a great mea&s;ure be prevented, if tho&s;e who received, and har|boured
<PB N="18" REF="19">
vagrants were &s;earched out, and rigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted for &s;uch offences. From the pre&s;ent difficulty of puni&s;hing the neglect of it, no re&s;pon|&s;ibility is annexed to this e&s;&s;ential part of the public &s;ervice. Transfer it as an expre&s;s duty to the over|&s;eer, who &s;hould have the &s;ubordinate aid of the con&s;table, and the long catalogue of felonious de|predations, would &s;oon be dimini&s;hed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Privy &s;earches to be made throughout every pari&s;h in the divi&s;ion, on the &s;ame night, as the be&s;t means of effectually correcting this evil.</NOTE></P>
<P>Being ve&s;ted with equal power, <HI>church-wardens</HI> are too much inclined to thwart their brother over|&s;eers in their be&s;t endeavors for the good govern|ment of the pari&s;h: worthle&s;s objects, to whom the over&s;eers have ju&s;tly refu&s;ed relief, often receive the protection and &s;upport of a church-warden, merely from a parade of di&s;tinct authority. This being in general their only interference, pari&s;hes might be &s;ecured from the burden and inconveni|ence of it, were church-wardens empowered, in future, to act but as deputies, during the ab&s;ence or indi&s;po&s;ition of the regular over&s;eers, and that in ca&s;es only of particular emergency.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="19" REF="20">
<HEAD>APPEALS.</HEAD>
<P>Appeals from orders of removal, form a very heavy part of the parochial burdens. Upon a mo|derate calculation, two-thirds of the appeals heard at the quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions, are either totally groundle&s;s, or prove wanton litigations between neighbouring pa|ri&s;hes. The&s;e notions of legal ho&s;tility are now &s;o ge|nerally inculcated, that no Over&s;eer thinks he makes a decent figure in the records of the pari&s;h which is honored with his mark, unle&s;s his pride has been gratified with an expen&s;ive appeal, though the object of &s;uch contention, may never become chargeable a &s;ingle &s;ix-pence! It appears pro|bable, that que&s;tions of this de&s;cription might either be prevented, or at lea&s;t be heard, and decided in a more &s;ummary way. For this end I would propo&s;e, that no appeals whatever, from orders of removal, &s;hould be admitted, without the previous inve&s;tigation and &s;anction of the major part of the magi&s;trates of the divi&s;ion, (at their petty &s;e&s;&s;ions a&s;&s;embled) in which the appellant pari&s;h is &s;ituate; and where the appellant, and re&s;pondent pari&s;hes both lie in the &s;ame divi&s;ion, that &s;uch appeals &s;hould be brought to i&s;&s;ue before the magi&s;trates of the divi|&s;ion afore&s;aid, from who&s;e adjudication no further

appeal &s;hould lie to the general quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions, but on peril of double co&s;ts to the appellant; one moiety whereof to be paid by the Over&s;eers them&s;elves, if &s;uch their appeal be adjudged vexatious by the &s;aid court of quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. <HI>Beaufoy,</HI> member for Yarmouth, has lately pre&s;ented a petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, from Mr. <HI>Wilkin&s;on,</HI> proprietor of a very exten&s;ive iron foundery, in the pari&s;h of BRADLEY, in the county of STAFFORD, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"praying that his manufacturers may be deemed extra-parochial, in order to avoid their removal to their re&s;pective &s;ettlements, or being liable to the rates of the pari&s;h where they re&s;ide; and &s;tating at the &s;ame time, that he will rai&s;e the taxes ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the relief of his own poor within them&s;elves, and that he will be bound, in his whole fortune, as a &s;ecu|rity for the &s;ame."</Q></P>
<P>It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible for Parliament to comply with the prayer of &s;o extraordinary a petition; the legi&s;lature would at no rate venture to declare them extra-parochial, till an adequate provi&s;ion was made for the relief of their poor, &amp;c. and how can the &s;ecurity for this nece&s;&s;ary fund be a&s;certained, in &s;o encrea&s;ing a colony of manufacturers?&mdash;Where is the for|tune that would be deemed equal to &s;uch a &s;ecurity? Indepen|dent of all this, in pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch a law, the whole doctrine of &s;ettlements mu&s;t be thus overturned, and a new code of poor|laws be framed for this particular occa&s;ion, before Mr. Wil|kin&s;on could po&s;&s;ibly be gratified in &s;o &s;ingular a requi&s;ition?</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>RATES.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hameful inequality of <HI>rates,</HI> has long, and ju&s;tly been complained of, as a grievous oppre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="21" REF="22">
on the &s;mall occupiers in mo&s;t pari&s;hes throughout the kingdom. It is not a rare in&s;tance, for the little farmer, renting but &s;ixty acres, to pay as heavy an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, as the wealthy yeoman, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more than double that quantity of land. An equality of rate, <HI>ad valorem,</HI> would be the mo&s;t effectual re|medy for this crying evil. To this the common place argument may be objected, of <HI>the impolicy of rating improvements;</HI> but &s;urely it is no le&s;s impoli|tic to limit them to the <HI>wealthy</HI> only, but for who&s;e grinding impo&s;ts, the &s;maller farmers might partake of the profit, as well as the credit of agricultural improvement.</P>
<P>A pari&s;h officer, before his rate is pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hould be &s;worn that no article whatever &s;tands charged thereon, but what has been, <HI>bona fide,</HI> expended for the &s;ole u&s;e of the poor.&mdash;This would be the means of excluding many of tho&s;e &s;muggled items of <HI>fea&s;ting,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. which lead, in no &s;mall mea|&s;ure, to the enormity of parochial burdens.</P>
<P>A certain &s;um per mile &s;hould be limitted for the removal, and bringing home of paupers; for &s;o vague and extravagant are the charges at pre&s;ent on this occa&s;ion, that pari&s;hes in general pay from &s;even up to fifteen pounds, for the mere incidental expence of removing two or three paupers, le&s;s than
<PB N="22" REF="23">
fifty miles! and the pari&s;hioners very rarely enquire into &s;uch &s;hameful conduct. To this we may add, that tho&s;e accounts are too often pa&s;&s;ed by the mere &s;ignature of the magi&s;trate, not only without a &s;ingle que&s;tion of enquiry, but even without the atte&s;ting oath of the officer.&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;everal duties of the <HI>Over&s;eer</HI> being once clearly, and expre&s;sly declared, an intermediate offi|cer between him and the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> might be ap|pointed to the great advantage of the public. The inefficacy of our admirable code of poor-laws, is, evidently, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the too di&s;tant gradation between the <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>Pari&s;h Officer.</HI> I would therefore propo&s;e, for each hun|dred, or divi&s;ion of a county,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A COMPTROLLER,</HEAD>
<P>with a &s;alary adequate to his trouble, who might be &s;ubject to heavy penalties for a neglect of his duty. He might be empowered to &s;ummon ve&s;try meetings of the re&s;pective pari&s;hes, in order to audit their quarterly accounts;&mdash;receive all pa|rochial pre&s;entments, and other complaints again&s;t pari&s;h officers upon oath, for malconduct in the di&s;charge of their duty, and make due return
<PB N="23" REF="24">
thereof, with all other requi&s;ite matter, to the petty &s;e&s;&s;ions, to be from thence returned to the general quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions, there to be duly enquired into, and the offending parties pro&s;ecuted at the ex|pence of the county. I &s;ee no objection to the <HI>High Con&s;table</HI> of the divi&s;ion being employed herein, with an additional &s;tipend, and thus rai&s;ed from an u&s;ele&s;s, to that of an active civil officer, between the Ju&s;tice and Over&s;eer, as above|&s;tated.&mdash;</P>
<P>For the comfortable &s;upport of the poor, the puni&s;hment of the di&s;orderly, and the economical expenditure of the parochial funds, but little more would be found wanting. Objects of di&s;tre&s;s, by the vigilance of active officers, would &s;oon be re|duced in their numbers. Children, from their earlie&s;t years, would be trained in the paths of indu&s;try; and, in any ca&s;es of mal-conduct on the part of pari&s;h officers, the nece&s;&s;ary appeal, through the <HI>Comptroller,</HI> or the neighbouring magi&s;trate, would be &s;peedy in its operation, and certain in its effect. Not a &s;lothful inhabitant could remain in a pari&s;h unaccounted for; nor a &s;ingle individual &s;up|port him&s;elf therein, without the vi&s;ible means of procuring an hone&s;t livelihood. Over&s;eers, however, mu&s;t have a more expre&s;s authority for
<PB N="24" REF="25">
this e&s;&s;ential part of their duty. Great mi&s;chief ari&s;es from the difficulty which they conceive might attend &s;uch rigorous exertions, by virtue of any law at pre&s;ent enacted. Ju&s;tices of the peace &s;hould, at the &s;ame time be empowered, on the complaint of pari&s;h officers, &s;ummarily to puni&s;h idle and di&s;orderly per&s;ons, who refu&s;e to labour, or are not able to render a good account of them&s;elves. The pre&s;ent, and only mode of &s;ending them to the hou&s;e of correction, there to await the deci&s;ion of the quar|terly &s;e&s;&s;ions, is of it&s;elf often a puni&s;hment too heavy for the offence; and in&s;tead of operating to|wards the amendment of the culprit, nine times out of ten only qualifies him by a general contamina|tion of morals, for the mo&s;t de&s;perate atchieve|ments!</P>

<HEAD>WORKHOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>For the really poor, and indigent, a comfortable provi&s;ion might be made within their own pari&s;h, without re&s;orting to tho&s;e exten&s;ive ho&s;pitals which your plan, Sir, propo&s;es for their general reception. I &s;ee no great objection to hou&s;es of indu&s;try be|tween two, or in &s;ome in&s;tances even three pari&s;hes; but the&s;e I would recommend to be under the ma|nagement
<PB N="25" REF="26">
of their re&s;pective over&s;eers, who would thus become u&s;eful cheques on each others' con|duct. Over them I would likewi&s;e place the gene|ral &s;uperintendance of the <HI>Comptroller.</HI> The e&s;tab|li&s;hed incorporations which you have enumerated, have, no doubt, been productive of local benefit; but this plan cannot, I think, be made generally advantageous. How, for in&s;tance, will you in|corporate exten&s;ive pari&s;hes rated ten &s;hil|lings, with neighbouring ones paying only three &s;hillings in the pound? The manufacturing towns of <HI>Cogge&s;hall, Braintree,</HI> and many others in the county where I re&s;ide, would, by &s;uch an union, throw great part of their parochial burdens, on per&s;ons deriving not the &s;malle&s;t advantage from the ma|nufactures that occa&s;ion them. I confe&s;s my&s;elf extremely adver&s;e to the practice of general ho&s;pitals, for the reception of great bodies of the infirm, who&s;e la&s;t re&s;ource is a <HI>workhou&s;e.</HI> The unavoidable tumult of &s;uch a mixed &s;ociety, is &s;eldom &s;ought for by declining age; nor will the wretch, grown grey in the &s;cenes of retirement, find this a fit a&s;y|lum, wherein to pa&s;s his few, la&s;t moments!&mdash;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>By &s;ome &s;uch ea&s;y plan as that I have ha&s;tily traced, open to many amendments, the general intere&s;ts of all concerned, I conceive, might be effectually &s;ecured. Two-thirds of the pre&s;ent
<PB N="26" REF="27">
rates, at the utmo&s;t, would thus be found ade|quate to the nece&s;&s;ary expenditure. The indigent would receive a comfortable provi&s;ion without being expo&s;ed to the iron rod of foreign ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, from who&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions under your &s;y&s;tem, there ap|pears but little pro&s;pect of redre&s;s! In a word, that it will fully embrace that <HI>union, &s;uperintendence, con|troul,</HI> and <HI>permanency of office,</HI> which your bill has propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having thus loo&s;ely &s;tated my objections to your &s;y&s;tem, and faintly &s;ketched a modified plan in its &s;tead, it is due to your laborious re&s;earches to ob|&s;erve, that your <HI>Bill,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> contain much valuable information. Your enquiry into the vari|ous <HI>charitable donations</HI> throughout the kingdom, will probably be productive of great good, by re&s;|cuing many a charitable boon from the &s;acrilegious gripe of the worthle&s;s. On the additional beque&s;ts which you expect will be made to the poor in con&s;e|quence of your plan, I reckon but little. The expi|ating offerings of &s;uper&s;tition are no longer in fa&s;hion: and good men, inclined to acts of beneficence, from principles of true charity, will, at this day, &s;eldom prefer parochial donations, which they now perceive, &s;erve only to alleviate the pari&s;h taxes of the wealthy.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">
Your <HI>Sunday toll</HI> on turnpike roads, towards the &s;upport of a contingent fund, would opperate par|tially, and therefore oppre&s;&s;ively. I &s;hall not notice your propo&s;ed <HI>tax on dogs;</HI>&mdash;plan of <HI>friendly &s;ocieties; Sunday &s;chools;&mdash;&s;mall debts;</HI>&mdash;of <HI>hue and cry,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. becau&s;e they are &s;ubjects totally unconnected with the main que&s;tion. The clau&s;e in your bill re&s;pecting <HI>ale-hou&s;es</HI> is, however, of too extraordinary a nature to be pa&s;&s;ed over without a remark:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To enact, that from and after the fir&s;t day of September, 1788, no licence &s;hall be granted to any per&s;on for keeping an ale-hou&s;e, inn, or vic|tualing-hou&s;e, unle&s;s it &s;hall appear by a certifi|cate from the commi&s;&s;ioners, or &s;ome proper of|ficer of the exci&s;e, that the per&s;on to whom &s;uch licence is to be granted, or the per&s;on who was licen&s;ed to the &s;ame hou&s;e for the year next pre|ceding, had paid duty for, or &s;old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> bar|rels of ale at lea&s;t, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>When the principal qualification for a licence, is <HI>exce&s;s of drinking,</HI> publicans of an orderly di&s;po&s;ition will nece&s;&s;arily be compelled to take down their &s;igns; but what benefit the State can derive from bartering an <HI>increa&s;e of debauchery,</HI> for a <HI>diminution</HI> of <HI>ale-hou&s;es,</HI> remains yet to be explained!</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29" MS="y">
Imperfect, however, as your &s;y&s;tem may appear to the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, con&s;iderable allowance &s;hould be made for your prejudice in its favor. You have &s;o long contemplated this favorite offspring, that it is no wonder if you now view it with too partial a regard; or in the fixed admiration of a plea&s;ing feature, you &s;hould have totally lo&s;t &s;ight of its mo&s;t &s;triking imperfections.</P>
<P>Your appeal to the Hou&s;e of Commons, will &s;oon bring this national que&s;tion to a parliamentary de|ci&s;ion. The event of that enquiry, I may &s;afely predict, will extend no further than a general eulogy on your good intentions. Indeed the pa&s;&s;ing your bill into a law, could yield no additional credit to your legi&s;lative character:&mdash;you mu&s;t &s;oon perceive that &s;uch a compliment was an indi&s;creet one, and lament, that it had been thus over&s;trained at the ex|pence of the country!</P>
