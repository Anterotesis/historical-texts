<L>Do&s;t Thou contrive, for &s;ome ba&s;e private end,</L>
<L>Some &s;elfi&s;h view, to hang a tru&s;ting friend,</L>
<L>To lure him on, e'en to his parting breath,</L>
<L>And promi&s;e life, to work him &s;urer death?</L>
<L>Grown old in villainy, and dead to grace,</L>
<L>Hell in his heart, and TYBURNE in his face;</L>
<L>Behold, a Par&s;on at thy Elbow &s;tands,</L>
<L>Low'ring damnation, and with open hands</L>
<L>Ripe to betray his Saviour for reward;</L>
<L>The Athei&s;t Chaplain of an Athei&s;t Lord.</L>

<L>Bred to the Church, and for the gown decreed,</L>
<L>'Ere it was known that I &s;hould learn to read;</L>

Tho' that was nothing, for my Friends, who knew</L>
<L>What mighty Dullne&s;s of it&s;elf could do,</L>

<L>What Creature's that, &s;o very pert and prim;</L>
<L>So very full of foppery, and whim;</L>
<L>So gentle, yet &s;o bri&s;k; &s;o wond'rous &s;weet,</L>
<L>So fit to prattle at a Lady's feet,</L>
<L>Who looks, as he the Lord's rich vineyard trod,</L>
<L>And by his Garb appears a man of God?</L>
<L>Tru&s;t not to looks, nor credit outward &s;how;</L>
