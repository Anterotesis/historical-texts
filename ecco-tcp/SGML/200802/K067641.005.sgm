<HEAD>EUSTACE BUDGELL, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>_WAS the elde&s;t &s;on of Gilbert Budgell, D. D. of St. Thomas near Ex|eter, by his fir&s;t wife Mary, the on|ly daughter of Dr. William Gul|&s;ton, bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol; who&s;e &s;i&s;ter Jane married dean Addi&s;on, and was mother to the famous Mr. Ad|di&s;on the &s;ecretary of &s;tate. This family of Budgell is very old, and has been &s;ettled, and known in Devon&s;hire above 200 years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Budgell's Letter to Cleomenes. Appendix p. 79.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">
Eu&s;tace was born about the year 1685, and di|&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf very &s;oon at &s;chool, from whence he was removed early to Chri&s;t's Church College in Oxford, where he was entered a gentleman commoner. He &s;taid &s;ome years in that univer&s;i|ty, and afterwards went to London, where, by his father's directions, he was entered of the Inner-Temple, in order to be bred to the Bar, for which his father had always intended him: but in&s;tead of the Law, he followed his own inclinations, which carried him to the &s;tudy of polite litera|ture, and to the company of the genteele&s;t people in town. This proved unlucky; for the father, by degrees, grew unea&s;y at his &s;on's not getting him&s;elf called to the Bar, nor properly applying to the Law, according to his r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ated directions and reque&s;t; and the &s;on complained of the &s;trict|ne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of his father's allowance, and con&s;tantly urged the nece&s;&s;ity of his living like a gentleman, and of his &s;pending a great deal of money. During this &s;tay, however, at the Temple, Mr. Budgell made a &s;trict intimacy and friend&s;hip with Mr. Addi&s;on, who was fir&s;t cou|&s;in to his mother; and this la&s;t gentleman being appointed, in the year 1710, &s;ecretary to lord Wharton, the lord lieutenant of Ireland, he made an offer to his friend Eu&s;tace of going with him as one of the clerks in his office. The propo&s;al being advantageous, and Mr. Budgell being then on bad terms with his father, and ab&s;olutely unqualified for the practice of the Law, it was readily accepted. Neverthele&s;s, for fear of his fa|ther's di&s;approbation of it, he never communicat|ed his de&s;ign to him 'till the very night of his &s;etting out for Ireland, when he wrote him a letter to inform him at once of his re&s;olution and journey. This was in the beginning of April 1710, when he was about twenty five years of age. He had by this time read the cla&s;&s;ics, the mo&s;t reputed
<PB N="3" REF="8">
hi&s;torians, and all the be&s;t French, Engli&s;h, or Italian writers. His apprehen&s;ion was quick, his imagination fine, and his memory remarkably &s;trong; though his greate&s;t commendations were a very genteel addre&s;s, a ready wit and an excellent elocution, which &s;hewed him to advantage wherever he went. There was, notwith&s;tanding, one principal defect in his di&s;po|&s;ition, and this was an infinite vanity, which gave him &s;o in&s;ufferable a pre&s;umption, as led him to think that nothing was too much for his capaci|ty, nor any preferment, or favour, beyond his de|&s;erts. Mr. Addi&s;on's fondne&s;s for him perhaps in|crea&s;ed this di&s;po&s;ition, as he naturally introduced him into all the company he kept, which at that time was the be&s;t, and mo&s;t ingenious in the two kingdoms. In &s;hort, they lived and lodged toge|ther, and con&s;tantly followed the lord lieutenant in|to England at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>It was now that Mr. Budgell commenced author, and was partly concerned with Sir Richard Steele and Mr. Addi&s;on in writing the Tatler. The Spectators being &s;et on foot in 1710-11, Mr. Budg|ell had likewi&s;e a &s;hare in them, as all the papers marked with an X may ea&s;ily inform the reader, and indeed the eighth volume was compo&s;ed by Mr. Addi&s;on and him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See The Bee, vol. ii. p. 854.</NOTE>, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sir Richard Steele. The &s;peculations of our author were generally liked, and Mr. Addi&s;on was fre|quently complimented upon the ingenuity of his kin&s;man. About the &s;ame time he wrote an epi|logue to the Di&s;tre&s;s'd Mother<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">'Till then it was u&s;ual to di&s;continue an epilogue after the &s;ixth night. But this was called for by the audience, and con|tinued for the whole run of this play: Budgell did not &s;cruple to &s;it in the pit, and call for it him&s;elf.</NOTE>, which had a great|er run than any thing of that kind ever had be|fore, and has had this peculiar regard &s;hewn to it &s;ince, that now, above thirty years afterwards, it is generally &s;poke at the repre&s;entation of that
<PB N="4" REF="9">
play. Several little epigrams and &s;ongs, which have a good deal of wit in them, were al&s;o writ|ten by Mr. Budgell near this period of time, all which, together with the known affection of Mr. Addi&s;on for him, rai&s;ed his character &s;o much, as to make him be very generally known and talked of.</P>
<P>His father's death in 1711 threw into his hands all the e&s;tates of the family, which were about 950 l. a year, although they were left incumbered with &s;ome debts, as his &s;ather was a man of pride and &s;pirit, kept a coach and &s;ix, and always liv|ed beyond his income, notwith&s;tanding his &s;piri|tual preferments, and the money he had received with his wives. Dr. Budgell had been twice mar|ried, and by his fir&s;t lady left five children living after him, three of whom were &s;ons, En&s;tace, our author, Gilbert, a Clergyman, and William, the fellow of New College in Oxford. By his la&s;t wife (who was Mrs. Forte&s;cue, mother to the late ma&s;ter of the rolls, and who &s;urvived him) he had no i&s;&s;ue. Notwith&s;tanding this acce&s;s of fortune, Mr. Budgell in no wi&s;e altered his manner of liv|ing; he was at &s;mall expence about his per&s;on, &s;tuck very clo&s;e to bu&s;ine&s;s, and gave general &s;a|tisfaction in the di&s;charge of his office.</P>
<P>Upon the laying down of the Spectator, the Guardian was &s;et up, and in this work our au|thor had a hand along with Mr. Addi&s;on and Sir Richard Steele. In the preface it is &s;aid, tho&s;e papers marked with an a&s;teri&s;k are by Mr. Budgell.</P>
<P>In the year 1713 he publi&s;hed a very elegant tran&s;lation of Theophra&s;tus's Characters, which Mr. Addi&s;on in the Lover &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'is the be&s;t ver&s;ion extant of any ancient author in the Engli&s;h lan|guage.'</Q>  It was dedicated to the lord Hallifax, who was the greate&s;t patron our author ever had, and with whom he always lived in the greate&s;t in|timacy.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10">
Mr. Budgell having regularly made his progre&s;s in the &s;ecretary of &s;tate's office in Ireland; up|on the arrival of his late Maje&s;ty in England, was appointed under &s;ecretary to Mr. Addi&s;on, and chief &s;ecretary to the Lords Ju&s;tices of Ireland. He was made likewi&s;e deputy clerk of the council in that kingdom, and &s;oon after cho&s;e member of the Iri&s;h parliament, where he became a very good &s;peaker. The po&s;t of under &s;ecretary is reckon|ed worth 1500 l. a year, and that of deputy clerk to the council 250 l. a year. Mr. Budgell &s;et out for Ireland the 8th of October, 1714, offici|ated in his place in the privy council the 14th, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ecretary's office, and was immediately admitted &s;ecretary to the Lords Ju&s;tices. In the &s;ame year at a public entertain|ment at the Inns of Court in Dublin, he, with many people of di&s;tinction, was made an honorary bencher. At his fir&s;t entering upon the &s;ecretary's place, after the removal of the tories on the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of his late Maje&s;ty, he lay under very great difficulties; all the former clerks of his office re|fu&s;ing to &s;erve, all the books with the form of bu&s;ine&s;s being &s;ecreted, and every thing thrown into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; yet he &s;urmounted the&s;e difficulties with very uncommon re&s;olution, a&s;&s;idu|ity, and ability, to his great honour and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Within a twelvemonth of his entering upon his employments, the rebellion broke out, and as, for &s;everal years (during all the ab&s;ences of the lord lieutenant) he had di&s;charged the office of &s;ecreta|ry of &s;tate, and as no tran&s;port office at that time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, he was extraordinarily charged with the care of the embarkation, and the providing of &s;hipping (which is generally the province of a field-officer) for all the troops to be tran&s;ported to Scotland. However, he went through this exten|&s;ive and unu&s;ual complication of bu&s;ine&s;s, with great exactne&s;s and ability, and with very &s;ingu|lar
<PB N="6" REF="11">
di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, for he took no extraordinary &s;ervice money on this account, nor any gratuity, or fees for any of the commi&s;&s;ions which pa&s;&s;ed through his office for the colonels and officers of militia then rai&s;ing in Ireland. The Lords Ju|&s;tices pre&s;&s;ed him to draw up a warrant for a ve|ry hand&s;ome pre&s;ent, on account of his great zeal, and late extraordinary pains (for he had often &s;at up whole nights in his office) but he very gen|teely and firmly refu&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;on, upon becoming principal &s;ecretary of &s;tate in England in 1717, procured the place of accomptant and comptroller general of the revenue in Ireland &s;or Mr. Budgell, which is worth 400 l. a year, and might have had him for his under &s;ecretary, but it was thought more expedient for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, that Mr. Budgell &s;hould continue where he was. Our author held the&s;e &s;everal places until the year 1718, at which time the duke of Bolton was appointed lord lieutenant. His grace carried one Mr. Edward Web&s;ter over with him (who had been an under clerk in the Trea&s;ury) and made him a privy coun&s;ellor and his &s;ecretary. This gentleman, 'twas &s;aid, in&s;i&s;ted upon the quartering a friend on the under &s;ecretary, which produced a mi&s;under&s;tanding between them; for Mr. Budgell po&s;itively declared, he would never &s;ubmit to any &s;uch condition whil&s;t he executed the office, and af|fected to treat Mr. Web&s;ter him&s;elf, his education, abilities, and family, with the utmo&s;t contempt. He was indi&s;creet enough, prior to this, to write a lampoon, in which the lord lieutenant was not &s;pared: he would publi&s;h it (&s;o fond was he of this brat of his brain) in oppo&s;ition to Mr. Addi&s;on's opinion, who &s;trongly per&s;uaded him to &s;uppre&s;s it; as the publication, Mr. Addi&s;on &s;aid, could nei|ther &s;erve h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s intere&s;t, or reputation. Hence many di&s;contents aro&s;e between them, 'till at length the lord lieutenant, in &s;upport of his
<PB N="7" REF="12">
&s;ecretary, &s;uper&s;eded Mr. Budgell, and very &s;oon after got him removed from the place of accompt|ant-general. However, upon the fir&s;t of the&s;e re|movals taking place, and upon &s;ome hints being given by his private &s;ecretary, captain Guy Dick|ens (now our mini&s;ter at Stockholm) that it would not probably be &s;afe for him to remain any longer in Ireland, he immediately entru&s;ted his papers and private concerns to the hands of his brother William, then a clerk in his office, and &s;et out for England. Soon after his arrival he publi&s;hed a pamphlet repre&s;enting his ca&s;e, in|tituled, A Letter to the Lord **** from Eu|&s;tace Budgell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Accomptant General of Ire|land, and late Secretary to their Excellencies the Lords Ju&s;tices of that Kingdom; eleven hundred copies of which were &s;old off in one day, &s;o great was the curio&s;ity of the public in that particular. Afterwards too in the Po&s;t-Boy of January 17, 1718-19, he publi&s;hed an Adverti&s;ement to ju&s;ti|fy his character again&s;t a report that had been &s;pread to his di&s;advantage: and he did not &s;cru|ple to declare in all companies that his life was attempted by his enemies, or otherwi&s;e he &s;hould have attended his &s;eat in the Iri&s;h Parliament. His behaviour, about this time, made many of his friends judge he was become delirious; his pa&s;&s;ions were certainly exceeding &s;trong, nor were his vanity and jealou&s;y le&s;s. Upon his coming to England he had lo&s;t no time in waiting upon Mr. Addi&s;on, who had re&s;igned the &s;eals, and was retired into the country for the &s;ake of his health; but Mr. Addi&s;on found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tem the tide of oppo&s;ition, which was every where running again&s;t his kin&s;man, through the influence and power of the duke of Bolton. He therefore di&s;&s;waded him in the &s;tronge&s;t man|ner from publi&s;hing his ca&s;e, but to no manner of purpo&s;e, which made him tell a friend in great anxiety, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Mr. Budgell was wi&s;er than any man

he ever knew, and yet he &s;uppo&s;ed the world would hardly believe he acted contrary to his advice.'</Q> Our author's great and noble friend the lord Halli|fax was dead, and my lord Orrery, who held him in the highe&s;t e&s;teem, had it not in his power to pro|cure him any redre&s;s. However, Mr. Addi&s;on had got a promi&s;e from lord Sunderland, that as &s;oon as the pre&s;ent clamour was a little abated, he would do &s;omething for him.</P>
<P>Mr. Budgell had held the con&s;iderable places of under &s;ecretary to the Lord Lieutenant, and &s;ecre|tary to the Lords Ju&s;tices for four years, during which time he had never been ab&s;ent four days from his office, nor ten miles from Dublin. His application was indefatigable, and his natural &s;pi|rits capable of carrying him through any difficul|ty. He had lived always genteelly, but frugally, and had &s;aved a large &s;um of money, which he now engaged in the South-Sea &s;cheme. During his abode in Ireland, he had collected materials for writing a Hi&s;tory of that kingdom, for which he had g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eat advantages, by having an ea&s;y recour&s;e to all the public offices; but what is become of it, and whether he ever fini&s;hed it, we are not cer|tainly informed. It is undoubtedly a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, becau&s;e there is no tolerable hi&s;tory of that nation, and becau&s;e we might have expected a &s;a|tisfactory account from &s;o plea&s;ing a writer.</P>
<P>He wrote a pamphlet, after he came to England, again&s;t the famous Peerage Bill, which was very well received by the public, but highly offended the earl of Sunderland. It was exceedingly cried up by the oppo&s;ition, and produced &s;ome overtures of friend&s;hip at the time, from Mr. Robert Walpole, to our author. Mr. Addi&s;on's death, in the year 1719, put an end, however, to all his hopes of &s;ucceeding at court, where he continued, never|thele&s;s, to make &s;everal attempts, but was con|&s;tantly kept down by the weight of the duke of
<PB N="9" REF="14">
Bolton. In the September of that year he went into France, through all the &s;trong places in Flan|ders and Brabant, and all the con&s;iderable towns in Holland, and then went to Hanover, from whence he returned with his Maje&s;ty's retinue the November following.</P>
<P>But the fatal year of the South-Sea, 1720, ru|ined our author entirely, for he lo&s;t above 20,000 l. in it; however he was very active on that occa&s;i|on, and made many &s;peeches at the general courts of the South-Sea Company in Merchant-Taylors Hall, and one in particular, which was afterwards printed both in French and Engli&s;h, and run to a third edition. And in 1721 he publi&s;hed a pam|phlet with &s;ucce&s;s, called, A Letter to a Friend in the Country, occa&s;ioned by a Report that there is a De&s;ign &s;till forming by the late Directors of the South-Sea Company, their Agents and A&s;&s;o|ciates, to i&s;&s;ue the Receipts of the 3d and 4th Sub&s;criptions at 1000 l. per Cent. and to extort about 10 Millions more from the mi&s;erable Peo|ple of Great Britain; with &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on the pre&s;ent State of Affairs both at Home and Abroad. In the &s;ame year he publi&s;hed A Let|ter to Mr. Law upon his Arrival in Great Bri|tain, which run through &s;even editions very &s;oon. Not long afterwards the duke of Portland, who&s;e fortune had been likewi&s;e de&s;troyed by the South-Sea, was appointed governor of Jamaica, upon which he immediately told Mr. Budgell he &s;hould go with him as his &s;ecretary, and &s;hould always live in the &s;ame manner with him&s;elf, and that he would contrive every method of making the employment profitable and agreeable to him: but his grace did not know how obnoxious our au|thor had rendered him&s;elf; for within a few days after this offer's taking air, he was acquainted in form by a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, that if he thought of Mr. Budgell, the government would appoint an|other governor in his room.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="15">
After being deprived of this la&s;t re&s;ource, he tried to get into the next parliament at &s;everal places, and &s;pent near 5000 l. in un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts, which compleated his ruin. And from this period he began to behave and live in a very different manner from what he had ever done before; wrote libellous pamphlets again&s;t Sir Robert Walpole and the mini&s;try; and did many unju&s;t things with re|&s;pect to his relations; being di&s;tracted in his own private fortune, as, indeed, he was judged to be, in his &s;en&s;es; torturing his invention to find out ways of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting and eluding his ill-&s;tars, his pride at the &s;ame time working him up to the highe&s;t pitches of re&s;entment and indignation again&s;t all courts and courtiers.</P>
<P>His younger brother, the fellow of New-College, who had more weight with him than any body, had been a clerk under him in Ireland, and continued &s;till in the office, and who bad fair for ri&s;ing in it, died in the year 1723, and after that our author &s;eem|ed to pay no regard to any per&s;on. Mr. William Budg|ell was a man of very good &s;en&s;e, extremely &s;teady in his conduct, and an adept in all calculations and mathematical que&s;tions; and had be&s;ides great good-nature and ea&s;ine&s;s of temper.</P>
<P>Our author as I before ob&s;erved, perplexed his private affairs from this time as much as po&s;&s;ible, and engaged in numberle&s;s law-&s;uits, which brought him into di&s;tre&s;&s;es that attended him to the end of his life.</P>
<P>In 1727 Mr. Budgell had a 1000 l. given him by the late Sarah, duche&s;s dowager of Marlborough, to who&s;e hu&s;band (the famous duke of Marlborough) he was a relation by his mother's &s;ide, with a view to his getting into parliament. She knew he had a talent for &s;peaking in public, and that he was ac|quainted with bu&s;ine&s;s, and would probably run any lengths again&s;t the mini&s;try. However this &s;cheme failed, for he could never get cho&s;en.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16">
In the year 1730 and about that time, he clo&s;ed in with the writers again&s;t the admini&s;tration, and wrote many papers in the Craft&s;man. He likewi&s;e publi&s;hed a pamphlet, intitled, A Letter to the Craft&s;man, from E. Budgell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> occa&s;ioned by his late pre&s;enting an humble complaint again&s;t the right honourable Sir Robert Walpole, with a Po&s;t|&s;cript. This ran to a ninth edition. Near the &s;ame time too he wrote a Letter to Cleomenes King of Sparta, from E. Budgell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> being an An&s;wer Paragraph by Paragraph to his Spartan Maje&s;ty's Royal Epi&s;tle, publi&s;hed &s;ome time &s;ince in the Daily Courant, with &s;ome Account of the Manners and Government of the Antient Greeks and Romans, and Political Reflections thereon. And not long after there came out A State of one of the Author's Ca&s;es before the Hou&s;e of Lords, which is generally printed with the Letter to Cleomenes: He likewi&s;e publi&s;hed on the &s;ame occa&s;ion a pamphlet, which he calls Liberty and Property, by E. Budgell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> wherein he complains of the &s;eizure and lo&s;s of many valuable papers, and particularly a collection of Letters from Mr. Addi&s;on, lord Hallifax, Sir Richard Steele, and other people, which he de|&s;igned to publi&s;h; and &s;oon after he printed a &s;equel or &s;econd part, under the &s;ame title.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year he al&s;o publi&s;hed his Poem upon his Maje&s;ty's Journey to Cambridge and New-market, and dedicated it to the Queen. Another of his per|formances is a poetical piece, intitled A Letter to his Excellency Ulrick D'Ypres, and C&mdash;, in An|&s;wer to his excellency's two Epi&s;tles in the Daily-Courant; with a Word or Two to Mr. O&s;born the Hyp Doctor, and C&mdash;. The&s;e &s;everal perform|ances were very well received by the public.</P>
<P>In the year 1733 he began a weekly pamphlet (in the nature of a Magazine, though more judici|ou&s;ly compo&s;ed) called The Bee, which he continu|ed for about 100 Numbers, that bind into eight
<PB N="12" REF="17">
Volumes Octavo, but at la&s;t by quarrelling with his book&s;ellers, and filling his pamphlet with things en|tirely relating to him&s;elf, he was obliged to drop it. During the progre&s;s of this work, Dr. Tindall's death happened, by who&s;e will Mr. Budgell had 2000 l. left him; and the world being &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch a gift, immediately imputed it to his making the will him&s;elf. This produced a paper-war be|tween him and Mr. Tindall, the continuator of Rapin, by which Mr. Budgell's character con&s;ider|ably &s;uffered; and this occa&s;ioned his Bee's being turned into a meer vindication of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is thought he had &s;ome hand in publi&s;hing Dr. Tind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ll's Chri&s;tianity as old as the Creation; and he often talked of another additional volume on the &s;ame &s;ubject, but never publi&s;hed it. However he u&s;ed to enquire very frequently after Dr. Conybear's health (who had been employed by her late maje&s;ty to an&s;wer the fir&s;t, and had been rewarded with the dean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ry of Chri&s;t-Church for his pains) &s;aying he hoped Mr. Dean would live a little while longer, that he might have the plea&s;ure of making him a bi&s;hop, for he intended very &s;oon to publi&s;h the other volume of Tindall, which would do the bu&s;ine&s;s. Mr. Budgell promi&s;ed likewi&s;e a volume of &s;everal curious pieces of Tindall's, that had been committed to his charge, with the life of the doctor; but never fulfilled his promi&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bee, Vol. II. page 1105.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the publication of the Bee a &s;mart pam|phlet came out, called A Short Hi&s;tory of Prime Mini&s;ters, which was generally believed to be writ|ten by our author; and in the &s;ame year he pub|li&s;hed A Letter to the Merchants and Trade&s;men of London and Bri&s;tol, upon their late glorious behaviour again&s;t the Exci&s;e Law.</P>
<P>After the extinction of the Bee, our author be|came &s;o involved with law-&s;uits, and &s;o incapable of living in the manner he wi&s;hed and affected to
<PB N="13" REF="18">
do, that he was reduced to a very unhappy &s;itua|tion. He got him&s;elf call'd to the bar, and at|tended for &s;ome time in the courts of law; but finding it was too late to begin that profe&s;&s;ion, and too difficult for a man not regularly trained to it, to get into bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;oon quitted it. And at la&s;t, after being ca&s;t in &s;everal of his own &s;uits, and be|ing di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to the utmo&s;t, he determined to make away with him&s;elf. He had always thought very loo&s;ely of revelation, and latterly became an avowed dei&s;t; which, added to his pride, greatly di&s;po&s;ed him to this re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Accordingly within a few days after the lo&s;s of his great cau&s;e, and his e&s;tates being decreed for the &s;atisfaction of his creditors, in the year 1736 he took boat at Somer&s;et-Stairs (after filling his pockets with &s;tones upon the beach) ordered the waterman to &s;hoot the bridge, and whil&s;t the boat was going under it threw him&s;elf over-board. Se|veral days before he had been vi&s;ibly di&s;tracted in his mind, and almo&s;t mad, which makes &s;uch an action the le&s;s wonderful.</P>
<P>He was never married, but left one natural daugh|ter behind him, who afterwards took his name, and was lately an actre&s;s at Drury-Lane.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, Mr. Budgell was of opinion, that when life becomes unea&s;y to &s;upport, and is overwhelmed with clouds, and &s;orrows, that a man has a natural right to take it away, as it is better not to live, than live in pain. The morning before he carried his notion of &s;elf-murder into execution, he endeavoured to per&s;uade his daughter to accom|pany him, which &s;he very wi&s;ely refu&s;ed. His ar|gument to induce her was; life is not worth the holding.&mdash;Upon Mr. Budgell's beauroe was found a &s;lip of paper; in which were written the&s;e words.<Q><L>What Cato did, and Addi&s;on approv'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to Cato's de&s;troying him&s;elf.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>Cannot be wrong.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="19">
Mr. Budgell had undoubtedly &s;trong natural parts, an excellent education, and &s;et out in life with every advantage that a man could wi&s;h, being &s;ettled in very great and profitable employments, at a very early age, by Mr. Addi&s;on: But by exce&s;&s;ive vanity and indi&s;cretion, proceeding from a fal&s;e e&s;tima|tion of his own weight and con&s;equence, he over|&s;tretched him&s;elf, and ruined his intere&s;t at court, and by the &s;ucceeding lo&s;s of his fortune in the South-Sea, was reduced too low to make any other head again&s;t his enemies. The unju&s;tifiable and di&s;honourable law-&s;uits he kept alive, in the remain|ing part of his life, &s;eem to be intirely owing to the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, which could never &s;ubmit to the living beneath what he had once done, and from that principle he kept a chariot and hou&s;e in Lon|don to the very la&s;t.</P>
<P>His end was like that of many other people of &s;pirit, reduced to great &s;treights; for &s;ome of the greate&s;t, as well as &s;ome of the mo&s;t infamous men have laid violent hands upon them&s;elves. As an author where he does not &s;peak of him&s;elf, and does not give a loo&s;e to his vanity, he is a very agreeable and de&s;erving writer; not argumentative or deep, but very ingenious and entertaining, and his &s;tile is peculiarly elegant, &s;o as to de&s;erve being ranked in that re&s;pect with Addi&s;on's, and is &s;upe|rior to mo&s;t of the other Engli&s;h writers. His Memoirs of the Orrery Family and the Boyle's, is the mo&s;t indifferent of his performances; though the tran&s;lations of Phalaris's Epi&s;tles in that work are done with great &s;pirit and beauty.</P>
<P>As to his brothers, the &s;econd, Gilbert, was thought a man of deeper learning and better judg|ment when he was young than our author, but was certainly inferior to him in his appearance in life; and, 'tis thought, greatly inferior to him in every re&s;pect. He was author of a pretty Copy of Ver&s;es in the VIIIth Vol. of the Spectators, Numb. 591. which begins thus,<Q><PB N="15" REF="20">
<L>Conceal, fond man, conceal the mighty &s;mart,</L>
<L>Nor tell Corinna &s;he has fir'd thy heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>And it is &s;aid that it was a repul&s;e from a lady of great fortune, with whom he was de&s;perately in love whil&s;t at Oxford, and to whom he had addre&s;&s;ed the&s;e lines, that made him di&s;regard him&s;elf ever after, neglect his &s;tudies, and fall into a habit of drinking. Whatever was the occa&s;ion of this la&s;t vice it ruined him. A lady had commended and de&s;ired to have a copy of his Ver&s;es once, and he &s;ent them, with the&s;e lines on the fir&s;t leaf&mdash;<Q><L>Lucretius hence thy maxim I abjure</L>

<P>This gentleman died unmarried, a little after his brother Eu&s;tace, at Exeter; having lived in a very di&s;reputable manner for &s;ome time, and having degenerated into &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive indolence, that he u&s;ually picked up &s;ome boy in the &s;treets, and carried him into the coffee-hou&s;e to read the news-papers to him. He had taken deacon's orders &s;ome years before his death, but had always been aver&s;e to that kind of life; and therefore became it very ill, and could never be prevailed upon to be a prie&s;t.</P>
<P>The third brother William, fellow of New-Col|lege in Oxford, died (as I mentioned before) one of the clerks in the Iri&s;h &s;ecretary of &s;tate's office, very young. He had been deputy accomptant general, both to his brother and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and like|wi&s;e deputy to Mr. Addi&s;on, as keeper of the re|cords in Birmingham-Tower. Had he lived, 'tis

probable he would have made a con&s;iderable figure, being a man of &s;ound &s;en&s;e and learning, with great prudence and honour. His cou&s;in Dr. Downes, then bi&s;hop of London-Derry, was his zealous friend, and Dr. Lavington the pre&s;ent bi&s;hop of Exeter, his fellow-collegian, was his intimate corre&s;pondent.

afterwards; and when he him&s;elf was rai&s;ed to the dignity of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, he appointed Mr. Tickell his under-&s;ecretary. Mr. Addi&s;on being obliged to re&s;ign on account of his ill-&s;tate of health, Mr. Craggs who &s;ucceeded him, continued Mr. Tickell in his place, which he held till that gentleman's death. When Mr. Addi&s;on was ap|pointed &s;ecretary, being a diffident man, he con|&s;ulted with his friends about di&s;po&s;ing &s;uch places as were immediately dependent on him. He com|municated to Sir Richard Steele, his de&s;ign of pre|ferring Mr. Tickell to be his under-&s;ecretary, which Sir Richard, who con&s;idered him as a petulant man, warmly oppo&s;ed. He ob&s;erved that Mr. Tickell was of a temper too enterpri&s;ing to be governed, and as he had no opinion of his honour, he did not know what might be the con&s;equence, if by in&s;inu|ation and flattery, or by bolder means, he ever had an opportunity of rai&s;ing him&s;elf. It holds pretty generally true, that diffident people under the ap|pearance of di&s;tru&s;ting their own opinions, are fre|quently po&s;itive, and though they pur&s;ue their re|&s;olutions with trembling, they never fail to pur&s;ue them. Mr. Addi&s;on had a little of this temper in him. He could not be per&s;uaded to &s;et a&s;ide Mr. Tickell, nor even had &s;ecrecy enough to conceal from him Sir Richard's opinion. This produced a great animo&s;ity between Sir Richard and Mr. Tickell, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted during their lives.</P>
<P>Mr. Tickell in his life of Addi&s;on, prefixed to his own edition of that great man's works, throws out &s;ome unmannerly reflexions again&s;t Sir Richard, who was at that time in Scotland, as one of the commi&s;&s;ioners on the &s;orfeited e&s;tates. Upon Sir Richard's return to London, he dedicates to Mr. Congreve, Addi&s;on's Comedy, called the Drummer, in which he takes occa&s;ion very &s;martly to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ort upon Tickell, and clears him&s;elf of the imputation laid to his charge, namely that of valuing him&s;elf upon Mr. Addi&s;on's papers in the Spectator.</P>

In June 1724 Mr. Tickell was appointed &s;ecre|tary to the Lords Ju&s;tices in Ireland, a place &s;ays Mr. Coxeter, which he held till his death, which happened in the year 1740.</P>
<P>It does not appear that Mr. Tickell was in any re&s;pect ungrateful to Mr. Addi&s;on, to whom he owed his promotion; on the other hand we find him take every opportunity to celebrate him, which he always performs with &s;o much zeal, and earne&s;tne&s;s, that he &s;eems to have retained the mo&s;t la&s;ting &s;en&s;e of his patron's favours. His poem to the earl of War|wick on the death of Mr. Addi&s;on, is very pathe|tic. He begins it thus,<Q><L>If dumb too long, the drooping Mu&s;e hath &s;tray'd,</L>
<L>And left her debt to Addi&s;on unpaid,</L>
<L>Blame not her &s;ilence, Warwick, but bemoan,</L>

<L>Slow comes the ver&s;e, that real woe in&s;pires:</L>
<L>Grief unaffected &s;uits but ill with art,</L>
<L>Or flowing numbers with a bleeding heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Tickell's works are printed in the &s;econd volume of the Minor Poets, and he is by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable writer among&s;t them. He has a very happy talent in ver&s;ification, which much ex|ceeds Addi&s;on's, and is inferior to few of the Eng|li&s;h Poets, Mr. Dryden and Pope excepted. The fir&s;t poem in this collection is addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;up|po&s;ed author of the Spectator.</P>
<P>In the year 1713 Mr. Tickell wrote a poem, cal|led The Pro&s;pect of Peace, addre&s;&s;ed to his excel|lency the lord privy-&s;eal; which met with &s;o fa|vourable a reception from the public, as to go thro' &s;ix editions. The &s;entiments in this poem are natu|ral, and obvious, but no way extraordinary. It is an

a&s;&s;emblage of pretty notions, poetically expre&s;&s;ed; but conducted with no kind of art, and altogether without a plan. The following exordium is one of the mo&s;t &s;hining parts of the poem.<Q><L>Far hence be driv'n to Scythia's &s;tormy &s;hore</L>

<P>Thus we have endeavoured to exhibit an Idea of the writings of Mr. Tickell, a man of a very ele|gant genius: As there appears no great invention in his works, if he cannot be placed in the fir&s;t rank of Poets; yet from the beauty of his numbers, and the real poetry which enriched his imagination, he has, at lea&s;t, an unexceptionable claim to the &s;econd.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. MATTHEW CONCANEN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was a native of Ireland, and was bred to the Law. In this profe&s;&s;ion he &s;eems not to have made any great figure. By &s;ome means or other he conceived an aver&s;ion to Dr. Swift, for his abu&s;e of whom, the world taxed him with ingratitude. Concanen had once enjoyed &s;ome degree of Swift's favour, who was not always very happy in the choice of his companions. He had an opportunity of reading &s;ome of the Dr's poems in MS. which it is &s;aid he thought fit to appropriate and publi&s;h as his own.</P>
<P>As affairs did not much pro&s;per with him in Ireland, he came over to London, in company with another gentleman, and both commenced writers. The&s;e two friends entered into an ex|traordinary agreement. As the &s;ubjects which then attracted the attention of mankind were of a political ca&s;t, they were of opinion that no &s;pecies of writing could &s;o &s;oon recommend them to public notice; and in order to make their trade more profitable, they re&s;olved to e&s;pou&s;e different intere&s;ts; one &s;hould oppo&s;e, and the other defend the mini&s;try. They determined the &s;ide of the que&s;tion each was to e&s;pou&s;e, by to&s;&s;ing up a half-penny, and it fell to the &s;hare of Mr. Concanen to defend the mini&s;try, which
<PB N="28" REF="33">
ta&s;k he performed with as much ability, as poli|tical writers generally di&s;cover.</P>
<P>He was for &s;ome time, concerned in the Briti&s;h, and London Journals, and a paper called The Speculati&s;t. The&s;e periodical pieces are long &s;ince buried in neglect, and perhaps would have even &s;unk into oblivion, had not Mr. Pope, by his &s;a|tyrical writings, given them a kind of di&s;graceful immortality. In the&s;e Journals he publi&s;hed many &s;currilities again&s;t Mr. Pope; and in a pamphlet called, The Supplement to the Profound, he u&s;ed him with great virulence, and little candour. He not only imputed to him Mr. Brome's ver&s;es (for which he might indeed &s;eem in &s;ome degree accounta|ble, having corrected what that gentleman did) but tho&s;e of the duke of Buckingham and others. To this rare piece &s;ome body humorou&s;ly per&s;waded him to take for his motto, De profundis clamavi. He afterwards wrote a paper called The Daily Courant, wherein he &s;hewed much &s;pleen again&s;t lord Bolingbroke, and &s;ome of his friends. All the&s;e provocations excited Mr. Pope to give him a place in his Dunciad. In his &s;econd book, l. 287, when he repre&s;ents the dunces diving in the mud of the Thames for the prize, he &s;peaks thus of Concanen;<Q><L>True to the bottom &s;ee Concanen creep,</L>

<L>If per&s;everance gain the diver's prize,</L>
<L>Not everla&s;ting Blackmore this denies.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the year 1725 Mr. Concanen publi&s;hed a vo|lume of poems in 8vo. con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of com|po&s;itions of his own, and &s;ome few of other gen|tlemen; they are addre&s;&s;ed to the lord Gage, whom he endeavours artfully to flatter, without

offending his mode&s;ty. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I &s;hall begin this Ad|dre&s;s, &s;ays he, by declaring that the opinion I have of a great part of the following ver&s;es, is the highe&s;t indication of the e&s;teem in which I hold the noble character I pre&s;ent them to. Several of them have authors, who&s;e names do honour to whatever patronage they receive. As to my &s;hare of them, &s;ince it is too late, after what I have already delivered, to give my opi|nion of them, I'll &s;ay as much as can be &s;aid in their favour. I'll affirm that they have one mark of merit, which is your lord&s;hip's appro|bation; and that they are indebted to fortune for two other great advantages, a place in good company, and an honourable protection.'</Q></P>
<P>The gentlemen, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted Concanen in this collection, were Dean Swift, Mr. Parnel, Dr. De|lany, Mr. Brown, Mr. Ward, and Mr. Stirling. In this collection there is a poem by Mr. Conca|nen, called A Match at Football, in three Cantos; written, 'tis &s;aid, in imitation of The Rape of the Lock. This performance is far from being de&s;picable; the ver&s;ification is generally &s;mooth; the de&s;ign is not ill conceived, and the cha|racters not unnatural. It perhaps would be read with more applau&s;e, if The Rape of the Lock did not occur to the mind, and, by forcing a compa|ri&s;on, de&s;troy all the &s;atisfaction in peru&s;ing it; as the di&s;proportion is &s;o very con&s;iderable. We &s;hall quote a few lines from the beginning of the third canto, by which it will appear that Conca|nen was not a bad rhimer.<Q><L>In days of yore a lovely country maid</L>

It has been remarked of Cowley, who likewi&s;e experienced many of the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, that he was happy in the acquaintance of the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, who performed the la&s;t offices which can be paid to a poet, in the elegant Memorial he made of his Life. Though Mr. Savage was as much inferior to Cowley in genius, as in the rectitude of his life, yet, in &s;ome re&s;pect, he bears a re&s;emblance to that great man. None of the poets have been more honoured in the commemoration of their hi&s;tory, than this gentleman. The life of Mr. Savage was written &s;ome years after his death by a gentleman, who knew him intimately, capable to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween his follies, and tho&s;e good qualities which were often concealed from the bulk of mankind by the abjectne&s;s of his condition. From this ac|count<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However &s;lightly the author of Savage's life pa&s;&s;es over the le&s;s amiable characteri&s;tics of that unhappy man; yet we can|not but di&s;cover therein, that vanity and ingratitude were the prin|cipal ingredients in poor Savage's compo&s;ition; nor was his veraci|ty greatly to be depended on. No wonder therefore, if the good-natur'd writer &s;uffer'd his better under&s;tanding to be mi&s;led, in &s;ome accounts relative to the poet we are now &s;peaking of&mdash;Among many, we &s;hall at pre&s;ent only take notice of the fol|lowing, which makes too con&s;picuous a figure to pa&s;s by en|tirely unnoticed. In this life of Savage 'tis related, that Mrs. Oldfield was very fond of Mr. Savage's conver&s;ation, and allowed him an annuity, during her life, of 50 l.&mdash;The&s;e facts are equally ill|grounded:&mdash;There was no foundation for them. That Savage's misfortunes pleaded for pity, and had the de&s;ir'd effect on Mrs. Oldfield's compa&s;&s;ion, is certain:&mdash;But &s;he &s;o much di&s;liked the man, and di&s;approved his conduct, that &s;he never admitted him to her conver&s;ation, nor &s;uffer'd him to enter her hou&s;e. She, indeed, often relieved him with &s;uch donations, as &s;poke her generous di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;But this was on the &s;ollicitation of friends, who frequently &s;et his calamities before her in the mo&s;t piteous light; and from a principle of humanity, &s;he became not a little in&s;trumental in &s;aving his life.</NOTE> we have compiled that which we now pre|&s;ent to the reader.</P>

In the year 1697 Anne counte&s;s of Maccles|field, having lived for &s;ome time on very unea&s;y terms with her hu&s;band, thought a public con|fe&s;&s;ion of adultery the mo&s;t expeditious method of obtaining her liberty, and therefore declared the child with which &s;he then was big was begotten by the earl of Rivers. This circum&s;tance &s;oon produced a &s;eparation, which, while the earl of Macclesfield was pro&s;ecuting, the counte&s;s, on the 10th of January 1697-8, was delivered of our au|thor; and the earl of Rivers, by appearing to con|&s;ider him as his own, left no room to doubt of her declaration. However &s;trange it may appear, the counte&s;s looked upon her &s;on, from his birth, with a kind of re&s;entment and abhorrence. No &s;ooner was her &s;on born, than &s;he di&s;covered a re|&s;olution of di&s;owning him, in a &s;hort time re|moved him from her &s;ight, and committed him to the care of a poor woman, whom &s;he directed to educate him as her own, and enjoined her never to inform him of his true parents. In&s;tead of de|fending his tender years, &s;he took delight to &s;ee him &s;truggling with mi&s;ery, and continued her per&s;ecution, from the fir&s;t hour of his life to the la&s;t, with an implacable and re&s;tle&s;s cruelty. His mother, indeed, could not affect others with the &s;ame barbarity, and though &s;he, who&s;e tender &s;ol|licitudes
<PB N="34" REF="39">
&s;hould have &s;upported him, had launched him into the ocean of life, yet was he not wholly abandoned. The lady Ma&s;on, mother to the counte&s;s, undertook to tran&s;act with the nur&s;e, and &s;uperintend the education of the child. She placed him at a grammar &s;chool near St. Albans, where he was called by the name of his nur&s;e, without the lea&s;t intimation that he had a claim to any other. While he was at this &s;chool, his father, the earl of Rivers, was &s;eized with a di&s;temper which in a &s;hort time put an end to his life. While the earl lay on h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s death-bed, he thought it his duty to provide for him, among&s;t his other natural children, and therefore demanded a po&s;itive account of him. His mother, who could no longer refu&s;e an an&s;wer, determined, at lea&s;t, to give &s;uch, as &s;hould deprive him for ever of that happine&s;s which competency affords, and declared him dead; which is, perhaps, the fir&s;t in&s;tance of a fal&s;hood invented by a mother, to deprive her &s;on of a provi&s;ion which was de|&s;igned him by another. The earl did not imagine that there could exi&s;t in nature, a mother that would r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in her &s;on, without enriching her&s;elf, and there|fore be&s;towed upon another &s;on &s;ix thou&s;and pounds, which he had before in his will bequeathed to Savage. The &s;ame cruelty which incited her to inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cept this provi&s;ion intended him, &s;ugge&s;ted another pro|ject, worthy of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition. She endeavour|ed to rid her&s;elf from the danger of being at any time made known to him, by &s;ending him &s;ecretly to the American Plantations; but in this contrivance her malice was defeated.</P>
<P>Being &s;till re&s;tle&s;s in the per&s;ecution of her &s;on, &s;he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">med another &s;cheme of burying him in po|verty and ob&s;curity; and that the &s;tate of his life, if not the place of his re&s;idence, might keep him for ever at a di&s;tance from her, &s;he ordered him to be placed with a Sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">maker in Holbourn,
<PB N="35" REF="40">
that after the u&s;ual time of trial he might be|come his apprentice. It is generally reported, that this project was, for &s;ome time, &s;ucce&s;sful, and that Savage was employed at the awl longer than he was willing to confe&s;s; but an unexpected di&s;covery determined him to quit his occupation.</P>
<P>About this time his nur&s;e, who had always treat|ed him as her own &s;on, died; and it was natu|ral for him to take care of tho&s;e effects, which by her death were, as he imagined, become his own. He therefore went to her hou&s;e, opened her boxes, examined her papers, and found &s;ome letters written to her by the lady Ma&s;on, which in|formed him of his birth, and the rea&s;ons for which it was concealed.</P>
<P>He was now no longer &s;atisfied with the em|ployment which had been allotted him, but thought he had a right to &s;hare the affluence of his mother, and therefore, without &s;cruple, applied to her as her &s;on, and made u&s;e of every art to awake her tenderne&s;s, and attract her regard. It was to no purpo&s;e that he frequently &s;ollicited her to admit him to &s;ee her, &s;he avoided him with the utmo&s;t precaution, and ordered him to be ex|cluded from her hou&s;e, by whom&s;oever he might be introduced, and what rea&s;on &s;oever he might give for entering it.</P>
<P>Savage was at this time &s;o touched with the di&s;|covery of his real mother, that it was his fre|quent practice to walk in the dark evenings for &s;everal hours before her door, in hopes of &s;eeing her by accident.</P>
<P>But all his a&s;&s;iduity was without effect, for he could neither &s;often her heart, nor open her hand, and while he was endeavouring to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e the affections of a mother, he was reduced to the mi&s;eries of want. In this &s;ituation he was obliged to find other means of &s;upport, and became by nece&s;&s;ity an author.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="41">
His fir&s;t attempt in that province was, a poem again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Bangor, who&s;e controver&s;y, at that time, engaged the attention of the nation, and furni&s;hed the curious with a topic of di&s;pute. Of this performance Mr. Savage was afterwards a&s;hamed, as it was the crude effort of a yet un|cultivated genius. He then attempted another kind of writing, and, while but yet eighteen, offered a comedy to the &s;tage, built upon a Spa|ni&s;h plot; which was refu&s;ed by the players. Up|on this he gave it to Mr. Bullock, who, at that time rented the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields of Mr. Rich, and with me&s;&s;ieurs Keene, Pack, and others undertook the direction thereof. Mr. Bullock made &s;ome &s;light alterations, and brought it upon the &s;tage, under the title of Woman's a Riddle, but allowed the real author no part of the profit. This occa&s;ioned a quarrel between Savage and Bul|lock; but it ended without blood&s;hed, though not without high words: Bullock in&s;i&s;ted he had a tran&s;|lation of the Spani&s;h play, from whence the plot was taken, given him by the &s;ame lady who had be&s;towed it on Savage.&mdash;Which was not improbable, as that whim&s;ical lady had given a copy to &s;everal others.</P>
<P>Not di&s;couraged, however, at this repul&s;e, he wrote, two years after, Love in a Veil, another Comedy borrowed likewi&s;e from the Spani&s;h, but with little better &s;ucce&s;s than before; for though it was received and acted, yet it appeared &s;o late in the year, that Savage obtained no other advan|tage from it, than the acquaintance of Sir Richard Steele, and Mr. Wilks, by whom, &s;ays the author of his Life, he was pitied, care&s;&s;ed, and relieved. Sir Richard Steele declared in his favour, with that ge|nuine benevolence which con&s;tituted his character, promoted his intere&s;t with the utmo&s;t zeal, and taking all opportunities of recommending him; he a&s;&s;erted, '<Q REND="inline">that the inhumanity of his mother had
<PB N="37" REF="42">
given him a right to find every good man his fa|ther.'</Q> Nor was Mr. Savage admitted into his ac|quaintance only, but to his confidence and e&s;teem. Sir Richard intended to have e&s;tabli&s;hed him in &s;ome &s;ettled &s;cheme of life, and to have contract|ed a kind of alliance with him, by marrying him to a natural daughter, on whom he intended to be&s;tow a thou&s;and pounds. But Sir Richard con|ducted his affairs with &s;o little oeconomy, that he was &s;eldom able to rai&s;e the &s;um, which he had offered, and the marriage was con&s;equently delayed. In the mean time he was officiou&s;ly informed that Mr. Savage had ridiculed him; by which he was &s;o much exa&s;perated that he withdrew the allow|ance he had paid him, and never afterwards ad|mitted him to his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He was now again abandoned to fortune, with|out any other friend but Mr. Wilks, a man to whom calamity &s;eldom complained without relief. He naturally took an unfortunate wit into his pro|tection, and not only a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in any ca&s;ual di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but continued an equal and &s;teady kind|ne&s;s to the time of his death. By Mr. Wilks's in|terpo&s;ition Mr. Savage once obtained of his mo|ther fifty pounds, and a promi&s;e of one hundred and fifty more, but it was the fate of this unhappy man, that few promi&s;es of any advantage to him were ever performed.</P>
<P>Being thus obliged to depended upon Mr. Wilks, he was an a&s;&s;iduous frequenter of the theatres, and, in a &s;hort time, the amu&s;ements of the &s;tage took &s;uch a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, that he was never ab&s;ent from a play in &s;everal years.</P>
<P>In the year 1723 Mr. Savage brought another piece on the &s;tage. He made choice of the &s;ubject of Sir Thomas Overbury: If the circum&s;tances in which he wrote it be con&s;idered, it will afford at once an uncommon proof of &s;trength of genius, and an evenne&s;s of mind not to be ruffled. During
<PB N="38" REF="43">
a con&s;iderable part of the time in which he was employed upon this performance, he was with|out lodging, and often without food; nor had he any other conveniencies for &s;tudy than the fields, or the &s;treet; in which he u&s;ed to walk, and form his &s;peeches, and afterwards &s;tep into a &s;hop, beg for a few moments the u&s;e of pen and ink, and write down what he had compo&s;ed, upon paper which he had picked up by accident.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage had been for &s;ome time di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by Aaron Hill, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with very particular kindne&s;s; and on this occa&s;ion it was natural to apply to him, as an author of e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation. He therefore &s;ent this Tragedy to him, with a few ver&s;es, in which he de&s;ired his correction. Mr. Hill who was a man of unbounded humanity, and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed politene&s;s, readily complied with his reque&s;t; and wrote the prologue and epi|logue, in which he touches the cirum&s;tances of the author with great tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage at la&s;t brought his play upon the &s;tage, but not till the chief actors had quitted it, and it was repre&s;ented by what was then called the &s;ummer-company. In this Tragedy Mr. Savage him&s;elf performed the part of Sir Thomas Overbury, with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s, that he always blotted out his name from the li&s;t of players, when a copy of his Tragedy was to be &s;hewn to any of his friends. This play however procured him the notice and e&s;teem of many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, for &s;ome rays of genius glimmered thro' all the mi&s;ts which poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion had &s;pread over it. The whole profits of this performance, acted, printed, and dedicated, amounted to about 200 l. But the genero&s;ity of Mr. Hill did not end here; he promoted the &s;ub&s;eription to his Mi&s;cellanies, by a
<PB N="39" REF="44">
very pathetic repre&s;entation of the author's &s;uffer|ings, printed in the Plain-Dealer, a periodical pa|per written by Mr. Hill. This generous effort in his favour &s;oon produced him &s;eventy-guineas, which were left for him at Button's, by &s;ome who commi&s;erated his misfortunes.</P>
<P>Mr. Hill not only promoted the &s;ub&s;cription to the Mi&s;cellany, but furni&s;hed likewi&s;e the greate&s;t part of the poems of which it is compo&s;ed, and particularly the Happy Man, which he publi&s;hed as a &s;pecimen. To this Mi&s;cellany he wrote a preface, in which he gives an account of his mother's cruelty, in a very uncommon &s;train of humour, which the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;ub&s;criptions probably in&s;pired.</P>
<P>Savage was now advancing in reputation, and though frequently involved in very perplexing ne|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ities, appeared however to be gaining on man|kind; when both his fame and his life were endan|gered, by an event of which it is not yet determin|ed, whether it ought to be mentioned as a crime or a calamity. As this is by far the mo&s;t intere&s;ting circum&s;tance in the life of this unfortunate man, we &s;hall relate the particulars minutely.</P>
<P>On the 20th of November 1727 Mr. Savage came from Richmond, where he had retired, that he might pur&s;ue his &s;tudies with le&s;s interruption, with an intent to di&s;charge a lodging which he had in We&s;tmin&s;ter; and accidentally meeting two gentle|men of his acquaintance, who&s;e names were Mar|chant and Gregory, he went in with them to a neighbouting Coffee-Hou&s;e, and &s;at drinking till it was late. He would willingly have gone to bed in the &s;ame hou&s;e, but there was not room for the whole company, and therefore they agreed to ram|ble about the &s;treets, and divert them&s;elves with
<PB N="40" REF="45">
&s;uch amu&s;ements as &s;hould occur till morning. In their walk they happened unluckily to di&s;cover light in Robin&s;on's Coffee-Hou&s;e, near Charing-Cro&s;s, and went in. Marchant with &s;ome rude|ne&s;s demanded a room, and was told that there was a good fire in the next parlour, which the com|pany were about to leave, being then paying their reckoning. Marchant not &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, ru&s;hed into the room, and was followed by his companions. He then petulantly placed him&s;elf between the company and the fire; and &s;oon after|wards kicked down the table. This produced a quarrel, &s;words were drawn on both &s;ides; and one Mr. James Sinclair was killed. Savage having wounded likewi&s;e a maid that held him, forced his way with Gregory out of the hou&s;e; but being in|timidated, and confus'd, without re&s;olution, whe|ther to fly, or &s;tay, they were taken in a back court by one of the company, and &s;ome &s;oldiers, whom he had called to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>When the day of the trial came on, the court was crowded in a very unu&s;ual manner, and the public appeared to intere&s;t it&s;elf as in a cau&s;e of ge|neral concern. The witne&s;&s;es again&s;t Mr. Savage and his friends, were the woman who kept the hou&s;e, which was a hou&s;e of ill-fame, and her maid, the men who were in the room with Mr. Sinclair, and a woman of the town, who had been drinking with them, and with whom one of them had been &s;een in bed.</P>
<P>They &s;wore in general, that Marchant gave the provocation, which Savage and Gregory drew their &s;words to ju&s;tify; that Savage drew fir&s;t, that he &s;tabb'd Sinclair, when he was not in a po&s;ture of defence, or while Gregory commanded his &s;word; that after he had given the thru&s;t he turned pale,
<PB N="41" REF="46">
and would have retired, but that the maid clung round him, and one of the company endeavoured to detain him, from whom he broke, by cutting the maid on the head.</P>
<P>Sinclair had declared &s;everal times before his death, for he &s;urvived that night, that he received his wound from Savage; nor did Savage at his trial deny the fact, but endeavoured partly to extenuate it, by urging the &s;uddenne&s;s of the whole action, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of any ill de&s;ign, or premeditated malice, and partly to ju&s;tify it by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence, and the hazard of his own life, if he had lo&s;t that opportunity of giving the thru&s;t. He ob&s;erved that neither rea&s;on nor law obliged a man to wait for the blow which was threatened, and which if he &s;hould &s;uffer, he might never be able to return; that it was always allowable to prevent an a&s;&s;ault, and to pre&s;erve life, by taking away that of the adver&s;ary, by whom it was endan|gered.</P>
<P>With regard to the violence with which he en|deavoured his e&s;cape, he declared it was not his de&s;ign to fly from ju&s;tice, or decline a trial, but to avoid the expences and &s;everities of a pri&s;on, and that he intended to appear at the bar, without com|pul&s;ion. This defence which took up more than an hour, was heard by the multitude that thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ged the court, with the mo&s;t attentive and re&s;pectful &s;ilence. Tho&s;e who thought he ought not to be acquitted, owned that applau&s;e could not be refu&s;ed him; and tho&s;e who before pitied his misfortunes, now re|verenced his abilities.</P>
<P>The witne&s;&s;es who appeared again&s;t him were proved to be per&s;ons of &s;uch characters as did not entitle them to much credit; a common &s;trumpet, a
<PB N="42" REF="47">
woman by whom &s;uch wretches were entertained, and a man by whom they were &s;upported. The character of Savage was by &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">veral per&s;ons of di&s;|tinction a&s;&s;erted to be that of a mode&s;t inoffen&s;ive man, not inclined to broils, or to in&s;olence, and who had to that time been only known by his mis|fortunes and his wit.</P>
<P>Had his audience been his judges, he had un|doubtedly been acquitted; but Mr. Page, who was then upon the bench, treated him with the mo&s;t brutal &s;everity, and in &s;umming up the evidence endeavoured to exa&s;perate the jury again&s;t him, and mi&s;repre&s;ent his defence. This was a provocation, and an in&s;ult, which the pri&s;oner could not bear, and therefore Mr. Savage re&s;olutely a&s;&s;erted, that his cau&s;e was not candidly explained, and began to re|capitulate what he had before &s;aid; but the judge having ordered him to be &s;ilent, which Savage treated with contempt, he commanded that he &s;hould be taken by force from the bar. The jury then heard the opinion of the judge, that good characters were of no weight again&s;t po&s;itive evidence, though they might turn the &s;cale, where it was doubtful; and that though two men attack each other, the death of either is only man&s;laughter; but where one is the aggre&s;&s;or, as in the ca&s;e before them, and in pur&s;uance of his fir&s;t attack kills the other, the law &s;uppo&s;es the action, however &s;udden, to be ma|licious. The jury determined, that Mr. Savage and Mr. Gregory were guilty of murder, and Mr. Marchant who had no &s;word, only man&s;laughter.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage and Mr. Gregory were conducted back to pri&s;on, where they were more clo&s;ely con|fined, and loaded with irons of fifty pound weight. Savage had now no hopes of life but from the king's mercy, and can it be believed,
<PB N="43" REF="48">
that mercy his own mother endeavoured to in|tercept.</P>
<P>When Savage (as we have already ob&s;erved) was fir&s;t made acquainted with the &s;tory of his birth, he was &s;o touched with tenderne&s;s for his mother, that he earne&s;tly &s;ought an opportu|nity to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>To prejudice the queen again&s;t him, &s;he made u&s;e of an incident, which was omitted in the order of time, that it might be mentioned together with the purpo&s;e it was made to &s;erve.</P>
<P>One evening while he was walking, as was his cu&s;tom, in the &s;treet &s;he inhabited, he &s;aw the door of her hou&s;e by accident open; he entered it, and finding no per&s;ons in the pa&s;&s;age to prevent him, went up &s;tairs to &s;alute her. She di&s;covered him before he could enter her chamber, alarmed the fa|mily with the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful out-cries, and when &s;he had by her &s;creams gathered them about her, ordered them to drive out of the hou&s;e that villain, who had forced him&s;elf in upon her, and endea|voured to murder her.</P>
<P>This abominable fal&s;ehood his mother repre&s;ented to the queen, or communicated it to &s;ome who were ba&s;e enough to relate it, and &s;o &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her maje&s;ty again&s;t this unhappy man, that for a long while &s;he rejected all petitions that were offered in his favour.</P>
<P>Thus had Savage peri&s;hed by the evidence of a bawd, of a &s;trumpet, and of his mother; had not ju&s;tice and compa&s;&s;ion procured him an advocate, of a rank too great to be rejected unheard, and of virtue too eminent to be heard without be|ing
<PB N="44" REF="49">
believed. The &s;tory of his &s;ufferings reach|ed the ear of the counte&s;s of Hertford, who en|gaged in his &s;upport with the tenderne&s;s and hu|manity peculiar to that amiable lady. She de|manded an audience of the queen, and laid be|fore her the whole &s;eries of his mother's cruelty, expo&s;ed the improbability of her accu&s;ation of murder, and pointed out all the circum&s;tances of her unequall'd barbarity.</P>
<P>The interpo&s;ition of this lady was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that he was &s;oon after admitted to bail, and on the 9th of March 1728, pleaded the king's pardon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Tyrconnel delivered a petition to his maje&s;ty in Sa|vage's behalf: And Mrs. Oldfield &s;ollicited Sir Robert Walpole on his account. This joint-intere&s;t procured him his pardon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage during his impri&s;onment, his trial, and the time in which he lay under &s;entence of death, behaved with great fortitude, and confirmed by his un&s;haken equality of mind, the e&s;teem of tho&s;e who before admired him for his abilities. Upon weigh|ing all the circum&s;tances relating to this unfortunate event, it plainly appears that the greate&s;t guilt could not be imputed to Savage. His killing Sinclair, was rather ra&s;h than totally di&s;honour|able, for though Marchant had been the aggre&s;&s;or, who would not procure his friend from being over-powered by numbers?</P>
<P>Some time after he had obtained his liberty, he met in the &s;treet the woman of the town that had &s;wore again&s;t him: She informed him that &s;he was in di&s;tre&s;s, and with unparalleled a&s;&s;urance de&s;ired him to relieve her. He, in&s;tead of in&s;ulting her mi&s;ery, and taking plea&s;ure in the calamity of one who had brought his life into danger, reproved
<PB N="45" REF="50">
her gently for her perjury, and changing the only guinea he had, divided it equally between her and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Compa&s;&s;ion &s;eems indeed to have been among the few good qualities po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Savage; he never appeared inclined to take the advantage of weakne&s;s, to attack the defencele&s;s, or to pre&s;s upon the falling: Whoever was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed was certain at la&s;t of his good wi&s;hes. But when his heart was not &s;oftened by the &s;ight of mi&s;ery, he was ob&s;tinate in his re&s;entment, and did not quickly lo&s;e the remembrance of an injury. He always harboured the &s;harpe&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t judge Page; and a &s;hort time before his death, he gratified it in a &s;atire upon that &s;evere magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>When in conver&s;ation this unhappy &s;ubject was mentioned, Savage appeared neither to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a murderer, nor as a man wholly free from blood. How much, and how long he regret|ted it, appeared in a poem publi&s;hed many years afterwards, which the following lines will &s;et in a very &s;triking light.<Q><LG>
<L>Is chance a guilt, that my di&s;a&s;t'rous heart,</L>
<L>For mi&s;chief never meant, mu&s;t ever &s;mart?</L>

<L>Young and unthoughtful then, who knows one day,</L>
<L>What rip'ning virtues might have made their way?</L>

<L>He might have &s;av'd &s;ome worth now doom'd to fall,</L>
<L>And I, perchance, in him have murder'd all.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Savage had now obtained his liberty, but was without any &s;ettled means of &s;upport, and as he had lo&s;t all tenderne&s;s for his mother, who had thir&s;ted for his blood, he re&s;olved to lampoon her, to extort that pen&s;ion by &s;atire, which he knew &s;he would never grant upon any principles of honour, or humanity. This expedient proved &s;ucce&s;sful; whether &s;hame &s;till &s;urvived, though compa&s;&s;ion was extinct, or whether her relations had more delicacy than her&s;elf, and imagined that &s;ome of the darts which &s;atire might point at her, would glance upon them: Lord Tyrconnel, whatever were his motives, upon his promi&s;e to lay a&s;ide the de&s;ign of expo&s;ing his mother, received him into his family, treated him as his equal, and engaged to allow him a pen|&s;ion of 200 l. a year.</P>
<P>This was the golden part of Mr. Savage's life; for &s;ome time he had no rea&s;on to complain of for|tune; his appearance was &s;plendid, his expences large, and his acquaintance exten&s;ive. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He was courted, &s;ays the author of his life, by all who endeavoured to be thought men of genius, and care&s;&s;ed by all that valued them&s;elves upon a fine ta&s;te. To admire Mr. Savage was a proof of di&s;cernment, and to be acquainted with him was a title to poetical reputation. His pre&s;ence was &s;ufficient to make any place of entertainment po|pular;
<PB N="47" REF="52">
and his approbation and example con&s;titu|ted the fa&s;hion. So powerful is genius, when it is inve&s;ted with the glitter of affluence. Men willingly pay to fortune that regard which they owe to merit, and are plea&s;ed when they have at once an opportunity of exerci&s;ing their vanity, and practi&s;ing their duty. This interval of pro&s;perity furni&s;hed him with opportunities of enlarging his knowledge of human nature, by contemplating life from its highe&s;t gradation to its lowe&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>In this gay period of life, when he was &s;urround|ed by the affluence of plea&s;ure, 1729, he publi&s;hed the Wanderer, a Moral Poem, of which the de&s;ign is compri&s;ed in the&s;e lines.<Q><L>I fly all public care, all venal &s;trife,</L>
<L>To try the <HI>Still,</HI> compared with <HI>Active Life.</HI></L>
<L>To prove by the&s;e the &s;ons of men may owe,</L>

<L>That ev'n calamity by thought refin'd</L>

<P>And more di&s;tinctly in the following pa&s;&s;age:<Q><L>By woe the &s;oul to daring actions &s;wells,</L>
<L>By woe in plaintle&s;s patience it excells;</L>
<L>From patience prudent, clear experience &s;prings,</L>

<L>Thence hope is form'd, thence fortitude, &s;ucce&s;s,</L>
<L>Renown&mdash;Whate'er men covet or care&s;s.</L></Q></P>
<P>This performance was always con&s;idered by Mr. Savage as his ma&s;ter-piece; but Mr. Pope, when he a&s;ked his opinion of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, told him, that he read it once over, and was not di&s;plea&s;ed with it, that it
<PB N="48" REF="53">
gave him more plea&s;ure at the &s;econd peru&s;al, and delighted him &s;till more at the third. From a poem &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully written, it might be rea&s;onably ex|pected that he &s;hould have gained con&s;iderable advantages; but the ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e; he &s;old the copy only for ten guineas. That he got &s;o &s;mall a price for &s;o fini&s;hed a poem, was not to be imputed either to the nece&s;&s;ity of the writer, or to the avarice of the book&s;eller. He was a &s;lave to his pa&s;&s;ions, and being then in the pur&s;uit of &s;ome trifling gratification, for which he wanted a &s;upply of money, he &s;old his poem to the fir&s;t bidder, and perhaps for the fir&s;t price which was propo&s;ed, and probably would have been content with le&s;s, if le&s;s had been offered. It was addre&s;&s;ed to the earl of Tyrconnel, not only in the fir&s;t lines, but in a for|mal dedication, filled with the highe&s;t &s;trains of panegyric. The&s;e prai&s;es in a &s;hort time he found him&s;elf inclined to retract, being di&s;carded by the man on whom he had be&s;towed them, and whom he &s;aid, he then di&s;covered, had not de&s;erved them.</P>
<P>Of this quarrel, lord Tyrconnel and Mr. Savage a&s;&s;igned very different rea&s;ons. Lord Tyrconnel charged Savage with the mo&s;t licentious behaviour, introducing company into his hou&s;e, and practi|&s;ing with them the mo&s;t irregular frolics, and com|mitting all the outrages of drunkenne&s;s. Lord Tyrconnel farther alledged again&s;t Savage, that the books of which he him&s;elf had made him a pre|&s;ent, were &s;old or pawned by him, &s;o that he had often the mortification to &s;ee them expo&s;ed to &s;ale upon &s;talls.</P>
<P>Savage, it &s;eems, was &s;o accu&s;tomed to live by expedients, that affluence could not rai&s;e him above them. He often went to the tavern and tru&s;ted the payment of his reckoning to the liberality of his company; and frequently of company to whom he was very little known. This conduct indeed, &s;el|dom drew him into much inconvenience, or his
<PB N="49" REF="54">
ver&s;ation and addre&s;s were &s;o plea&s;ing, that few thought the plea&s;ure which they received from him, dearly purcha&s;ed by paying for his wine. It was his peculiar happine&s;s that he &s;carcely ever found a &s;tranger, whom he did not leave a friend; but it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be added, that he had not often a friend long, without obliging him to become an enemy.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage on the other hand declared, that lord Tyrconnel quarrelled with him becau&s;e he would not &s;ubtract from his own luxury and extravagance what he had promi&s;ed to allow him; and that his re&s;entment was only a plea for the violation of his promi&s;e: He a&s;&s;erted that he had done nothing which ought to exclude him from that &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which he thought not &s;o much a favour as a debt, &s;ince it was offered him upon conditions, which he had never broken; and that his only fault was, that he could not be &s;upported upon nothing.</P>
<P>Savage's pa&s;&s;ions were &s;trong, among which his re&s;entment was not the weake&s;t; and as gratitude was not his con&s;tant virtue, we ought not too ha&s;ti|ly to give credit to all his prejudice a&s;&s;erts again&s;t (his once prai&s;ed patron) lord Tyrconnel.</P>
<P>During his continuance with the lord Tyrconnel, he wrote the Triumph of Health and Mirth, on the recovery of the lady Tyrconnel, from a lan|gui&s;hing illne&s;s. This poem is built upon a beauti|ful fiction. Mirth overwhelmed with &s;ickne&s;s for the death of a favourite, takes a flight in que&s;t of her &s;i&s;ter Health, whom &s;he finds reclined upon the brow of a lofty mountain, amid&s;t the fragrance of a perpetual &s;pring, and the breezes of the morning &s;porting about her. Being &s;olicited by her &s;i&s;ter Mirth, &s;he readily promi&s;es her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, flies away in a cloud, and impregnates the waters of Bath with new virtues, by which the &s;ickne&s;s of Belinda is relieved.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="55">
While Mr. Savage continued in high life, he did not let &s;lip any opportunity to examine whether the merit of the great is magnified or dimini&s;hed by the medium through which it is contemplated, and whether great men were &s;elected for high &s;tations, or high &s;tations made great men. The re&s;ult of his ob&s;ervations is not much to the advantage of tho&s;e in power.</P>
<P>But the golden aera of Savage's life was now at an end, he was bani&s;hed the table of lord Tyrconnel, and turned again a-drift upon the world. While he was in pro&s;perity, he did not behave with a moderation likely to procure friends among&s;t his inferiors. He took an opportunity in the &s;un-&s;hine of his fortune, to revenge him&s;elf of tho&s;e creatures, who, as they are the wor&s;hippers of power, made court to him, whom they had before contemptuou&s;ly treated. This a&s;&s;uming behaviour of Savage was not altogether unnatural. He had been avoided and de&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e de&s;picable &s;ycophants, who were proud of his acquaintance when rai&s;ed to eminence. In this ca&s;e, who would not &s;purn &s;uch mean Beings? His degradation therefore from the condi|tion which he had enjoyed with &s;o much &s;uperiority, was con&s;idered by many as an occa&s;ion of triumph. Tho&s;e who had courted him without &s;ucce&s;s, had an opportunity to return the contempt they had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Mean time, Savage was very diligent in expo&s;ing the faults of lord Tyrconnel, over whom he obtain|ed at lea&s;t this advantage, that he drove him fir&s;t to the practice of outrage and violence; for he was &s;o much provoked by his wit and virulence, that he came with a number of attendants, to beat him at a coffee-hou&s;e; but it happened that he had left the place a few minutes before: Mr. Savage went next day to repay his vi&s;it at his own hou&s;e, but was prevailed upon by his dome&s;tics to retire without in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;eeing him.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="56">
He now thought him&s;elf again at full liberty to expo&s;e the cruelty of his mother, and therefore about this time publi&s;hed THE BASTARD, a Poem remarkable for the vivacity in the beginning, where he makes a pompous enumeration of the imaginary advantages of ba&s;e birth, and the pathetic &s;enti|ments at the clo&s;e; where he recounts the real ca|lamities which he &s;uffered by the crime of his parents.</P>

<P>After mentioning the death of Sinclair, he goes on thus:<Q><L>&mdash;Where &s;hall my hope find re&s;t?&mdash;No mother's care</L>
<L>Shielded my infant innocence with prayer;</L>
<L>No father's guardian hand my youth maintain'd,</L>
<L>Call'd forth my virtues, and from vice re|&s;train'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>This poem had extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s, great numbers were immediately di&s;per&s;ed, and editions were multiplied with unu&s;ual rapidity.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance attended the publication, which Savage u&s;ed to relate with great &s;atisfaction. His mother, to whom the poem with due reverence was in&s;cribed, happened then to be at Bath, where &s;he could not conveniently retire from cen&s;ure, or con|ceal her&s;elf from ob&s;ervation; and no &s;ooner did the reputation of the poem begin to &s;pread, than &s;he heard it repeated in all places of concour&s;e; nor could &s;he enter the a&s;&s;embly-rooms, or cro&s;s the walks, without being &s;aluted with &s;ome lines from the Ba&s;tard. She therefore left Bath with the ut|mo&s;t ha&s;te, to &s;helter her&s;elf in the crowds of Lon|don. Thus Savage had the &s;atisfaction of finding, that tho' he could not reform, he could yet pu|ni&s;h his mother.</P>
<P>Some time after Mr. Savage took a re&s;olu|tion of applying to the queen, that having once given him life, &s;he would enable him to &s;up|port it, and therefore publi&s;hed a &s;hort poem on her birth day, to which he gave the odd title of Volunteer-Laureat. He had not at that time one friend to pre&s;ent his poem at court, yet the Quee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, notwith&s;tanding this act of ceremony was
<PB N="53" REF="58">
wanting, in a few days after publication, &s;ent him a bank note of fifty-pounds, by lord North and Guildford; and her permi&s;&s;ion to write annually on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and that he &s;hould yearly receive the like pre&s;ent, till &s;omething better &s;hould be done for him. After this he was permitted to pre|&s;ent one of his annual poems to her maje&s;ty, and had the honour of ki&s;&s;ing her hand.</P>
<P>When the di&s;pute between the bi&s;hop of London, and the chancellor, furni&s;hed for &s;ome time the chief topic of conver&s;ation, Mr. Savage who was an enemy to all claims of eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, engaged with his u&s;ual zeal again&s;t the bi&s;hop. In con&s;equence of his aver&s;ion to the dominion of &s;uper&s;titious churchmen, he wrote a poem called The Progre&s;s of a Divine, in which he conducts a profligate prie&s;t thro' all the gradations of wicked|ne&s;s, from a poor curacy in the country, to the highe&s;t preferment in the church; and after de&s;crib|ing his behaviour in every &s;tation, enumerates that this prie&s;t thus accompli&s;hed, found at la&s;t a patron in the bi&s;hop of London.</P>
<P>The clergy were univer&s;ally provoked with this &s;atire, and Savage was cen&s;ured in the weekly Mi&s;|cellany, with a &s;everity he did not &s;eem inclined to forget: But a return of invective was not thought a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment. The court of King's-Bench was moved again&s;t him, and he was ob|liged to return an an&s;wer to a charge of ob&s;cenity. It was urged in his defence, that ob&s;cenity was only criminal, when it was intended to promote the prac|tice of vice; but that Mr. Savage had only introdu|ced ob&s;cene ideas, with a view of expo&s;ing them to dete&s;tation, and of amending the age, by &s;hew|ing the deformity of wickedne&s;s. This plea was admitted, and Sir Philip York, now lord Chancellor, who then pre&s;ided in that court, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the in|formation,
<PB N="54" REF="59">
with encomiums upon the purity and ex|cellence of Mr. Savage's writings.</P>
<P>He was &s;till in his u&s;ual exigencies, having no certain &s;upport, but the pen&s;ion allowed him from the Queen, which was not &s;ufficient to la&s;t him the fourth part of the year. His conduct, with regard to his pen&s;ion, was very particular. No &s;ooner had he changed the bill, than he vani&s;hed from the &s;ight of all his acquaintances, and lay, for &s;ome time, out of the reach of his mo&s;t inti|mate friends. At length he appeared again pen|nyle&s;s as before, but never informed any per&s;on where he had been, nor was his retreat ever di&s;co|vered. This was his con&s;tant practice during the whole time he received his pen&s;ion. He regularly di&s;appeared, and returned. He indeed affirmed that he retired to &s;tudy, and that the money &s;up|ported him in &s;olitude for many months, but his friends declared, that the &s;hort time in which it was &s;pent, &s;ufficiently confuted his own account of his conduct.</P>
<P>His perpetual indigence, politene&s;s, and wit, &s;till rai&s;ed him friends, who were de&s;irous to &s;et him above want, and therefore &s;ollicited Sir Robert Walpole in his favour, but though promi&s;es were given, and Mr. Savage tru&s;ted, and was tru&s;ted, yet the&s;e added but one mortification more to the many he had &s;uffered. His hopes of prefer|ment from that &s;tate&s;man i&s;&s;ued in a di&s;appoint|ment; upon which he publi&s;hed a poem in the Gentleman's Magazine, entitled, The Poet's Depen|dance on a State&s;man; in which he complains of the &s;evere u&s;age he met with. But to de&s;pair was no part of the character of Savage; when one patronage failed, he had recour&s;e to another. The Prince was now extremely popular, and had very liberally rewarded the merit of &s;ome writers, whom Mr. Savage did not think &s;uperior to him&s;elf; and therefore he re&s;olved to addre&s;s a poem to him.
<PB N="55" REF="60">
For this purpo&s;e he made choice of a &s;ubject, which could regard only per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank, and greate&s;t affluence, and which was there|fore proper for a poem intended to procure the patronage of a prince; namely, public &s;pirit, with regard to public works. But having no friend upon whom he could prevail to pre&s;ent it to the Prince, he had no other method of attracting his ob&s;ervation, than by publi&s;hing frequent adverti&s;e|ments, and therefore received no reward from his patron, however generous upon other occa&s;ions. His poverty &s;till pre&s;&s;ing, he lodged as much by accident, as he dined; for he generally lived by chance, eating only when he was invited to the tables of his acquaintance, from which, the mean|ne&s;s of his dre&s;s often excluded him, when the politene&s;s, and variety of his conver&s;ation, would have been thought a &s;ufficient recompence for his entertainment. Having no lodging, he pa&s;&s;ed the night often in mean hou&s;es, which are &s;et open for any ca&s;ual wanderers; &s;ometimes in cellars, a|mong&s;t the riot and filth of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">igate of the rabble; and &s;ometimes when he was totally without money, walked about the &s;treets till he was weary, and lay down in the &s;um|mer upon a bulk, and in the winter, with his a&s;|&s;ociates in poverty, among the a&s;hes of a gla&s;s-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In this manner were pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e days and nights, which nature had enabled him to have employed in elevated &s;peculations. On a bulk, in a cellar, or in a gla&s;s-hou&s;e, among thieves and beggars, was to be found the author of The Wan|derer, the man, who&s;e remarks in life might have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;tate&s;man, who&s;e ideas of virtue might have enlightened the morali&s;t, who&s;e eloquence might have influenced &s;enates, and who&s;e delicacy might have poli&s;hed courts. His di&s;tre&s;&s;es, howe|ver afflictive, never dejected him. In his lowe&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="61">
&s;phere he wanted not &s;pirit to a&s;&s;ert the natural dignity of wit, and was always ready to repre&s;s that in&s;olence, which &s;uperiority of fortune incit|ed, and to trample that reputation which ro&s;e up|on any other ba&s;is, than that of merit. He never admitted any gro&s;s familiarity, or &s;ubmitted to be treated otherwi&s;e than as an equal.</P>
<P>Once, when he was without lodging, meat, or cloaths, one of his friends, a man indeed not remark|able for moderation in pro&s;perity, left a me&s;&s;age, that he de&s;ired to &s;ee him about nine in the morning. Savage knew that his intention was to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but was very much di&s;gu&s;ted, that he &s;hould pre|&s;ume to pre&s;cribe the hour of his attendance; and therefore rejected his kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t hard&s;hips of poverty were to Sa|vage, not the want of lodging, or of food, but the neglect and contempt it drew upon him. He complained that as his affairs grew de&s;perate, he found his reputation for capacity vi|&s;ibly decline; that his opinion in que&s;tions of cri|tici&s;m was no longer regarded, when his coat was out of fa&s;hion; and that tho&s;e, who in the interval of his pro&s;perity, were always encouraging him to great undertakings, by encomiums on his genius, and a&s;&s;urances of &s;ucce&s;s, now received any men|tion of his de&s;igns with coldne&s;s, and, in &s;hort, allowed him to be qualified for no other perform|ance than volunteer-laureat. Yet even this kind of contempt never depre&s;&s;ed him, for he always pre|&s;erved a &s;teady confidence in his own capacity, and believed nothing above his reach, which he &s;hould at any time earne&s;tly endeavour to attain.</P>
<P>This life, unhappy as it may be already ima|gined, was yet embittered in 1738 with new di|&s;tre&s;&s;es. The death of the Queen deprived him of all the pro&s;pects of preferment, with which he had &s;o long entertained his imagination. But even a|gain&s;t this calamity there was an expedient at
<PB N="57" REF="62">
hand. He had taken a re&s;olution of writing a &s;e|cond tragedy upon the &s;tory of Sir Thomas Over|bury, in which he made a total alteration of the plan, added new incidents, and introduced new characters, &s;o that it was a new tragedy, not a re|vival of the former. With the profits of this &s;cheme, when fini&s;hed, he fed his imagination, but proceeded &s;lowly in it, and, probably, only em|ployed him&s;elf upon it, when he could find no o|ther amu&s;ement. Upon the Queen's death it was expected of him, that he &s;hould honour her me|mory with a funeral panegyric: He was thought culpable for omitting it; but on her birth-day, next year, he gave a proof of the power of genius and judgment. He knew that the track of elegy had been &s;o long beaten, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to tra|vel in it, without treading the foot&s;teps of tho&s;e who had gone before him, and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary that he might di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf from the herd of encomi&s;ts, to find out &s;ome new walk of funeral panegyric.</P>
<P>This difficult ta&s;k he performed in &s;uch a man|ner, that this poem may be ju&s;tly ranked the be&s;t of his own, and among&s;t the be&s;t pieces that the death of Princes has produced. By transferring the mention of her death, to her birth-day, he has formed a happy combination of topics, which any other man would have thought it difficult to con|nect in one view; but the relation between them appears natural; and it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that what no other man could have thought on, now &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ems &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for any man to mi&s;s. In this poem, when he takes occa&s;ion to mention the King, he mode&s;tly gives him a hint to continue his pen&s;ion, which, however, he did not receive at the u&s;ual time, and there was &s;ome rea&s;on to think that it would be di&s;continued. He did not take tho&s;e methods of retrieving his intere&s;t, which were mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed, for he went one day
<PB N="58" REF="63">
to Sir Robert Walpole's levee, and demanded the rea&s;on of the di&s;tinction that was made between him and the other pen&s;ioners of the Queen, with a degree of roughne&s;s which, perhaps, determin|ed him to withdraw, what had only been delayed. This la&s;t misfortune he bore not only with decen|cy, but cheerfulne&s;s, nor was his gaiety clouded, even by this di&s;appointment, though he was, in a &s;hort time, reduced to the lowe&s;t degree of di&s;tre&s;s, and often wanted both lodging and food. At this time he gave another in&s;tance of the in&s;urmount|able ob&s;tinacy of his &s;pirit. His cloaths were worn out, and he received notice, that at a coffee-hou&s;e &s;ome cloaths and linen were left for him. The per&s;on who &s;ent them did not, we believe, inform him to whom he was to be obliged, that he might &s;pare the perplexity of acknowledging the benefit; but though the offer was &s;o far generous, it was made with &s;ome neglect of ceremonies, which Mr. Savage &s;o much re&s;ented, that he re|fu&s;ed the pre&s;ent, and declined to enter the hou&s;e 'till the cloaths, which were de&s;igned for him, were taken away.</P>
<P>His di&s;tre&s;s was now publicly known, and his friends therefore thought it proper to concert &s;ome mea&s;ures for his relief. The &s;cheme propo&s;ed was, that he &s;hould retire into Wales, and re|ceive an allowance of fifty pounds a year, to be rai&s;ed by &s;ub&s;cription, on which he was to live privately in a cheap place, without a&s;piring any more to affluence, or having any farther &s;ollici|tude for fame.</P>
<P>This offer Mr. Savage gladly accepted, though with intentions very different from tho&s;e of his friends; for they propo&s;ed that he &s;hould conti|nue an exile from London for ever, and &s;pend all the remaining part of his life at Swan&s;ea; but he de&s;igned only to take the opportunity which their &s;cheme offered him, of retreating for a &s;hort time,
<PB N="59" REF="64">
that he might prepare his play for the &s;tage, and his other works for the pre&s;s, and then to return to London to exhibit his tragedy, and live upon the profits of his own labour.</P>
<P>After many &s;ollicitations and delays, a &s;ub&s;crip|tion was at la&s;t rai&s;ed, which did not amount to fifty pounds a year, though twenty were paid by one gentleman. He was, however, &s;atisfied, and willing to retire, and was convinced that the al|lowance, though &s;canty, would be more than &s;uf|ficient for him, being now determined to com|mence a rigid oeconomi&s;t.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e &s;alutary re&s;olutions, he quitted Lon|don in 1739. He was furni&s;hed with fifteen guineas, and was told, that they would be &s;ufficient, not only for the expence of his journey, but for his &s;upport in Wales for &s;ome time; and that there re|mained but little more of the fir&s;t collection. He promi&s;ed a &s;trict adherence to his maxims of par|&s;imony, and went away in the &s;tage coach; nor did his friends expect to hear from him, 'till he informed them of his arrival at Swan&s;ea. But, when they lea&s;t expected, arrived a letter dated the 14th day after his departure, in which he &s;ent them word, that he was yet upon the road, and without money, and that he therefore could not proceed without a remittance. They then &s;ent him the money that was in their hands, with which he was enabled to reach Bri&s;tol, from whence he was to go to Swan&s;ea by water. At Bri&s;tol he found an embargo laid upon the &s;hipping, &s;o that he could not immediately obtain a pa&s;&s;age, and be|ing therefore obliged to &s;tay there &s;ome time, he, with his u&s;ual felicity, ingratiated him&s;elf with many of the principal inhabitants, was invited to their hou&s;es, di&s;tingui&s;hed at their public fea&s;ts, and treated with a regard that gratified his vanity, and therefore ea&s;ily engaged his affection.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="65">
After &s;ome &s;tay at Bri&s;tol, he retired to Swan|&s;ea, the place originally propo&s;ed for his re&s;idence, where he lived about a year very much di&s;&s;atis|fied with the diminution of his &s;alary, for the greate&s;t part of the contributors, irritated by Mr. Savage's letters, which they imagined treated them co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">temptuou&s;ly, withdrew their &s;ub&s;criptions. At this place, as in every other, he contracted an ac|quaintance with tho&s;e who were mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in that country, among whom, he has celebrated Mr. Powel, and Mrs. Jones, by &s;ome ver&s;es in|&s;erted in the Gentleman's Magazine. Here he compleated his tragedy, of which two acts were wanting when he left London, and was de&s;irous of coming to town to bring it on the &s;tage. This de&s;ign was very warmly oppo&s;ed, and he was ad|vi&s;ed by his chief benefactor, who was no other than Mr. Pope, to put it in the hands of Mr. Thom|&s;on and Mr. Mallet, that it might be fitted for the &s;tage, and to allow his friends to receive the pro|fits, out of which an annual pen&s;ion &s;hould be paid him. This propo&s;al he rejected with the ut|mo&s;t contempt. He was by no means convinced that the judgment of tho&s;e to whom he was re|quired to &s;ubmit, was &s;uperior to his own. He was now determined, as he expre&s;&s;ed, to be no longer kept in leading-&s;trings, and had no elevated idea of his bounty, who propo&s;ed to pen&s;ion him out of the profits of his own labours. He &s;oon after this quitted Swan&s;ea, and, with an intent to return to London, went to Bri&s;tol, where a repe|tition of the kindne&s;s which he had formerly &s;ound; invited him to &s;tay. He was not only ca|re&s;&s;ed, and treated, but had a collection made for him of about thirty pounds, with which it bad been happy if he had immediately departed for London; but he never con&s;idered that &s;uch proofs of kindne&s;s were not often to be expected, and that this ardour of benevolence was, in a great degree, the effect of novelty.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="66">
Another part of his mi&s;conduct was, the prac|tice of prolonging his vi&s;its to un&s;ea&s;onable hours, and di&s;concerting all the families into which he was admitted. This was an error in a place of commerce, which all the charms of conver&s;ation could not compenfate; for what trader would purcha&s;e &s;uch airy &s;atisfaction, with the lo&s;s of &s;olid gain, which mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of midhight merriment, as tho&s;e hours which were gained at night were generally lo&s;t in the morning? Di&s;tre&s;s at la&s;t &s;tole upon him by imperceptible degrees; his conduct had aheady wearied &s;ome of tho&s;e who were at fir&s;t enamoured of his conver&s;ation; but he &s;till might have de|volved to others, whom he might have entertained with equal &s;ucce&s;s, had not the decay of his cloaths made it no longer con&s;i&s;tent with decency to admit him to their tables, or to a&s;&s;ociate with him in public places. He now began to find every man from home, at who&s;e hou&s;e he called; and was therefore no longer able to procu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e the nece&s;&s;aries of life, but wandered about the town, &s;lighted and neglected, in que&s;t of a dinner, which he did not always obtain. To compleat his mife|ry, he was obliged to withdraw from the &s;mall number of friends from whom he had &s;till rea&s;on to hope for favours. His cu&s;tom was to lie in bed the greate&s;t part of the day, and to go out in the dark with the utmo&s;t privacy, and after having paid his vi&s;it, return again before morning to his lodging, which was in the garret of an ob&s;cure inn.</P>
<P>Being thus excluded on one hand, and confined on the other, he &s;uffered the utmo&s;t extremities of poverty, and often fa&s;ted &s;o long, that he was &s;eized with faintne&s;s, and had lo&s;t his appetite, not being able to bear the &s;mell of meat, 'till the action of his &s;tomach was re&s;tored by a cordial.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="67">
He continued to bear the&s;e &s;evere pre&s;&s;ures, 'till the landlady of a coffee-hou&s;e, to whom he owed about eight pounds, compleated his wretch|edne&s;s. He was arre&s;ted by order of this woman, and conducted to the hou&s;e of a Sheriff's Officer, where he remained &s;ome time at a great ex|pence, in hopes of finding bail. This expence he was enabled to &s;upport by a pre&s;ent from Mr. Na&s;h of Bath, who, upon hearing of his late mi&s;|fortune, &s;ent him five guineas. No friends would contribute to relea&s;e him from pri&s;on at the ex|pence of eight pounds, and therefore he was remov|ed to Newgate. He bore this misfortune with an un|&s;haken fortitude, and indeed the treatment he met with from Mr. Dagg, the keeper of the pri&s;on, greatly &s;oftened the rigours of his confinement. He was &s;upported by him at his own table, with|out any certainty of recompence; had a room to him&s;elf, to which he could at any time retire from all di&s;turbance; was allowed to &s;tand at the door of the pri&s;on, and &s;ometimes taken out into the fields; &s;o that he &s;uffered fewer hard&s;hips in the pri&s;on, than he had been accu&s;tomed to un|dergo the greate&s;t part of his life. Virtue is un|doubtedly mo&s;t laudable in that &s;tate which makes it mo&s;t difficult; and therefore the humanity of the gaoler certainly de&s;erves this public atte&s;tation.</P>
<P>While Mr. Savage was in pri&s;on, he began, and almo&s;t fini&s;hed a &s;atire, which he entitled London and Bri&s;tol Delineated; in order to be revenged of tho&s;e who had had no more genero&s;ity for a man, to whom they profe&s;&s;ed friend&s;hip, than to &s;uffer him to langui&s;h in a gaol for eight pounds. He had now cea&s;ed from corre&s;ponding with any of his &s;ub&s;cribers, except Mr. Pope, who yetcontinued to remit him twenty pounds a year, which he had promi&s;ed, and by whom he expected to be in a very &s;hort time enlarged; becau&s;e he had directed the keeper to enquire after the &s;tate of his debts.
<PB N="63" REF="68">
However he took care to enter his name according to the forms of the court, that the creditors might be obliged to make him &s;ome allowance, if he was continued a pri&s;oner; and when on that oc|ca&s;ion he appeared in the Hall, was treated with very unu&s;ual re&s;pect.</P>
<P>But the re&s;entment of the City was afterwards rai&s;ed, by &s;ome accounts that had been &s;pread of the &s;atire, and he was informed, that &s;ome of the Merchants intended to pay the allowance which the law required, and to detain him a pri&s;oner at their own expence. This he treated as an empty menace, and had he not been prevented by death, he would have ha&s;tened the publication of the &s;a|tire, only to &s;hew how much he was &s;uperior to their in&s;ults.</P>
<P>When he had been &s;ix months in pri&s;on, he re|ceived from Mr. Pope, in who&s;e kindne&s;s he had the greate&s;t confidence, and on who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he chiefly depended, a letter that contained a charge of very atrocious ingratitude, drawn up in &s;uch terms as &s;udden re&s;entment dictated. Mr. Savage returned a very &s;olemn prote&s;tation of his inno|cence, but however appeared much di&s;turbed at the accu&s;ation. Some days afterwards he was &s;eized with a pain in his back and &s;ide, which, as it was not violent, was not &s;u&s;pected to be dangerous; but growing daily more languid and dejected, on the 25th of July he confined him&s;elf to his room, and a fever &s;eized his &s;pirits. The &s;ymptoms grew every day more formidable, but his condition did not enable him to procure any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The la&s;t time the keeper &s;aw him was on July 31, when Savage, &s;eeing him at his bed-&s;ide, &s;aid, with un|common earne&s;tne&s;s, I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you, &s;ir, but, after a pau&s;e, moved his hand in a me|lancholy manner, and finding him&s;elf unable to recollect what he was going to communicate, &s;aid, 'tis gone. The keeper &s;oon after left him, and
<PB N="64" REF="69">
the next morning he died. He was buried in the church-yard of St. Peter, at the expence of the keeper.</P>
<P>Such were the life and death of this unfortu|nate poet; a man equally di&s;tingui&s;hed by his vir|tues and vices, and, at once, remarkable for his weakne&s;&s;es and abilities. He was of a middle &s;ta|ture, of a thin habit of body, a long vi&s;age, coar&s;e features, and a melancholy a&s;pect; of a grave and manly deportment, a &s;olemn dignity of mien, but which, upon a nearer acquaintance, &s;oftened into an engaging ea&s;ine&s;s of manners. His walk was &s;low, and his voice tremulous and mournful. He was ea&s;ily excited to &s;miles, but very &s;eldom pro|voked to laughter. His judgment was eminently exact, both with regard to writings and to men. The knowledge of life was his chief attainment. He was born rather to bear misfortunes greatly, than to enjoy pro&s;perity with moderation. He di&s;covered an amazing firmne&s;s of &s;pirit, in &s;purn|ing tho&s;e who pre&s;umed to dictate to him in the lowe&s;t circum&s;tances of mi&s;ery; but we never can reconcile the idea of true greatne&s;s of mind, with the perpetual inclination Savage di&s;covered to live upon the bounty of his friends. To &s;truggle for independence appears much more landable, as well as a higher in&s;tance of &s;pirit, than to be the pen&s;ioner of another.</P>
<P>As Savage had &s;een &s;o much of the world, and was capable of &s;o deep a penetration into nature, it was &s;trange he could not form &s;ome &s;cheme of a livelihood, more honourable than that of a poe|tical mendicaut: his pro&s;ecuting any plan of life with di&s;gence, would have thrown more lu|&s;tre on his character, than all his works, and have rai&s;ed our ideas of the greatne&s;s of his &s;plrit, much beyond the conduct we have already &s;een. If po|verty is &s;o great an evil as to expo&s;e a man to com|mit actions, at which he afterwards blu&s;hes, to a|void
<PB N="65" REF="70">
this poverty &s;hould be the continual care of every man; and he, who lets &s;lip every opportuni|ty of doing &s;o, is more entitled to admiration than pity, &s;hould he bear his &s;ufferings nobly.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage's temper, in con&s;equence of the do|minion of his pa&s;&s;ions, was uncertain and ca|pricious. He was ea&s;ily engaged, and ea&s;ily di&s;|gu&s;ted; but he is accu&s;ed of retaining his hatred more tenaciou&s;ly than his benevolence. He was compa&s;&s;ionate bo&s;h by nature and principle, and always ready to perform offices of humanity; but when he was provoked, and very &s;mall offences were &s;ufficient to provoke him, he would pro&s;ecute his revenge with the utmo&s;t acrimony, 'till his pa&s;&s;ion had &s;ub&s;ided. His friend&s;hip was there|fore of little value, for he was zealous in the &s;up|port, or vindication of tho&s;e whom he loved, yet it was always dangerous to tru&s;t him, becau&s;e he con&s;idered him&s;elf as di&s;charged by the fir&s;t quarrel, from all ties of honour and gratitude. He would even betray tho&s;e &s;ecrets, which, in the warmth of confidence, had been imparted to him. His veracity was often que&s;tioned, and not with|out rea&s;on. When he loved any man, he &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed all his faults, and when he had been of|fended by him, concealed all his virtues. But his characters were generally true, &s;o far as he pro|ceeded, though it cannot be denied, but his parti|ality might have &s;ometimes the effect of fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>In the words of the celebrated writer of his life, from whom, as we ob&s;erved in the beginning, we have extracted the account here given, we &s;hall conclude this unfortunate per&s;on's Memoirs, which were &s;o various as to afford large &s;cope for an able biographer, and which, by this gentleman, have been repre&s;ented with &s;o great a ma&s;tery, and force of penetration, that the Life of Savage, as written by him, is an excellent model for this &s;pe|cies of writing. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><PB N="66" REF="71"><P>'This relation (&s;ays he) will not be wholly with|out its u&s;e, if tho&s;e, who langui&s;h under any part of his &s;ufferings, &s;hould be enabled to for|tify their patience, by reflecting that they feel only tho&s;e afflictions from which the abilities of Savage did not exempt him; or tho&s;e, who in confidence of &s;uperior capacities, or attainments, di&s;regard the common maxims of life, &s;hall be reminded that nothing can &s;upply the want of prudence, and that negligence and irregularity long continued, will make knowledge u&s;ele&s;s, wit ridiculous, and genius contemptible.'</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>Dr. THOMAS SHERIDAN</HEAD>
<P>WAS born in the county of Cavan, where his father kept a public hou&s;e. A gen|tleman, who had a regard for his father, and who ob&s;erved the &s;on gave early indications of genius above the common &s;tandard, &s;ent him to the col|lege of Dublin, and contributed towards the fi|ni&s;hing his education there. Our poet received very great encouragement upon his &s;etting out in life, and was e&s;teemed a fortunate man. The agreeable humour, and the unre&s;erved plea&s;ant|ry of his temper, introduced him to the ac|quaintance, and e&s;tabli&s;hed him in the e&s;teem, of the wits of that age. He &s;et up a &s;chool in Dublin, which, at one time, was &s;o con&s;iderable as to produce an income of a thou&s;and pounds a year, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed be&s;ides &s;ome good livings, and bi&s;hops lea&s;es, which are extremely lucrative.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan married the daughter of Mr. Mac|pher&s;on, a Scots gentleman, who &s;erved in the wars under King William, and, during the trou|bles of Ireland, became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall e&s;tate of about 40 l. per annum, called Quilca. This little fortune devolved on Mrs. Sheridan, which enabled her hu&s;band to &s;et up a &s;chool. Dr. She|ridan, among&s;t his virtues, could not number oeco|nomy; on the contrary, he was remarkable for profu&s;ion and extravagance, which expo&s;ed him to &s;uch inconveniences, that he was obliged to mort|gage all he had. His &s;chool daily declined, and
<PB N="68" REF="73">
by an act of indi&s;cretion, he was &s;tript of the be&s;t living he then enjoyed. On the birth-day of his late Maje&s;ty, the Dr. having occa&s;ion to preach, cho&s;e for his text the following words,
<Q>Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</Q>
This procured him the name of a Jaeobite, or a di&s;affected per&s;on, a circum&s;tance &s;ufficient to ruin him in his eccle&s;ia&s;tical capacity. His friends, who were di&s;po&s;ed to think favourably of him, were for &s;oftning the epithet of Jacobite into Tory, imput|ing his choice of that text, rather to whim and humour, than any &s;ettled projudice again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, or the government; but this un&s;ea&s;onable plea&s;antry was not &s;o ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed over, and the Dr. had frequent occa&s;ion to repent the choice of his text.</P>
<P>Unhappy Sheridan! he lived to want both money and friends. He &s;pent his money and time mer|rily among the gay and the great, and was an ex|ample, that there are too many who can reli&s;h a man's humour, who have not &s;o quick a &s;en&s;e of his misfortunes. The following &s;tory &s;hould not have been told, were it not true.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of his misfortunes, when the demands of his creditors obliged him to re|tirement, he went to dean Swift, and &s;ollicited a lodging for a few days, 'till by a proper compo&s;ition he might be re&s;tored to his free|dom. The dean retired early to re&s;t. The Dr. fatigued, but not inclinable to go &s;o &s;oon to bed, &s;ent the &s;ervant to the dean, de&s;iring the key of the cellar, that he might have a bottle of wine. The dean, in one of his odd humours, returned for an&s;wer, he promi&s;ed to find him a lodging, but not in wine; and refu&s;ed to &s;end the key. The Dr. being thunder&s;truck at this unexpected incivi|lity, the tears bur&s;t from his eyes; he quitted the

hou&s;e, and we believe never after repeared the vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Dr. Sheridan died in the year 1738, in the 55^t^h year of his age. The following epitaph for him was handed about.<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">

<P>When the account of his death was in&s;erted in the papers, it was done in the following particular terms;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'September 10, died the revd. Dr. Thomas She|ridan of Dublin. He was a great lingui&s;t, a mo&s;t &s;incere friend, a delightful companion, and the be&s;t Schoolma&s;ter in Europe: He took the greate&s;t care of the morals of the young gentlemen, who had the happine&s;s of being bred up under him; and it was remarked, that none of his &s;cholars ever was an Athei&s;t, or a Free-Thinker.'</P></Q></P>
<P>We cannot more &s;ucce&s;sfully convey to the read|er a true idea of Dr. Sheridan, than by the two following quotations from Lord Orrery in his life of Swift, in which he occa&s;ionally mentions Swift's friend. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Swift was naturally fond of &s;eeing his works in print, and he was encouraged in this fondne&s;s by his friend Dr. Sheridan, who had the Cacoethes Scribendi, to the greate&s;t degree, and was con|tinually letting off &s;quibs, rockets, and all &s;orts of little fire-works from the pre&s;s; by which means he offended many particular per&s;ons, who, al|though
<PB N="70" REF="75">
they &s;tood in awe of Swift, held Shetidan at defiance. The truth is, the poor doctor by nature the mo&s;t peacable, inoffen&s;ive man alive, was in a continual &s;tate of warfare with the Minor Poets, and they revenged them&s;elves; or, in the &s;tyle of Mr. Bays, often gave him fla&s;h for fla&s;h, and &s;inged his feathers. The affection between The&s;eus and Perithous was not greater than the affection between Swift and Sheridan: But the friend&s;hip that cemented the two ancient heroes probably commenced upon motives very different from tho&s;e which united the two modern divines.'</P></Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Dr. Sheridan was a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, and in many in&s;tances, perfectly well adapted for that &s;tation. He was deeply vers'd in the Greek and Roman languages; and in their cu&s;toms and antiquities. He had that kind of good nature, which ab&s;ence of mind, indolence of body, and carele&s;sne&s;s of fortune produce: And although not over-&s;trict in his own conduct, yet he took care of the morality of his &s;cholars, whom he &s;ent to the univer&s;ity, remarkably well founded in all kind of cla&s;&s;ical learning, and not ill in&s;tructed in the &s;ocial duties of life. He was &s;lovenly, indigent, and chearful. He knew books much better than men: And he knew the value of money lea&s;t of all. In this &s;ituation, and with this di&s;po&s;ition, Swift fa&s;tened upon him as upon a prey, with which he intend|ed to regale him&s;elf, whenever his appetite &s;hould prompt him. Sheridan was therefore certainly within his reach; and the only time he was per|mitted to go beyond the limits of his chain, was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a living in the county of Corke, which had been be&s;towed upon him, by the then lord lieutenant of Ireland, the pre&s;ent earl of Granville. Sheridan, in one fatal mo|ment, or by one fatal text, effected his own ruin.

<P>WHEN the life of a per&s;on, who&s;e wit and genius rai&s;ed him to an eminence among writers of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, is written by one of un|common abilities:&mdash;One po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the power (as Shake&s;pear &s;ays) <HI>of looking quite thro' the deeds of men;</HI> we are furni&s;hed with one of the highe&s;t entertain|ments a man can enjoy:&mdash;Such an author al&s;o pre&s;ents us with a true picture of human nature, which affords us the mo&s;t ample in&s;truction:&mdash;He di&s;cerns the pa&s;&s;ions which play about the heart; and while he is a&s;toni&s;hed with the high efforts of genius, is at the &s;ame time enabled to ob&s;erve nature as it really is, and how di&s;tant from per|fection mankind are in this world, even in the mo&s;t refined &s;tate of humanity. Such an intellectual fea&s;t they enjoy, who peru&s;e the life of this great author, drawn by the ma&s;terly and impartial hand of lord Orrery. We there di&s;cern the greatne&s;s and weak|ne&s;s of Dean Swift; we di&s;cover the patriot, the genius, and the humouri&s;t; the peevi&s;h ma&s;ter, the ambitious &s;tate&s;man, the implacable enemy, and the warm friend. His mixed qualities and im|perfections are there candidly marked: His errors and virtues are &s;o &s;trongly repre&s;ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> that while we reflect upon his virtues, we forget he had &s;o many failings; and when we con&s;ider his errors, we are di&s;po&s;ed to think he had fewer virtues. With &s;uch candour and impartiality has lord Orrery drawn the portrait of Swift; and, as every biographer
<PB N="74" REF="79">
ought to do, has &s;hewn us the man as he really was.</P>
<P>Upon this account given by his lord&s;hip, is the following chiefly built. It &s;hall be our bu&s;ine&s;s to take notice of the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;ages of the life of Swift; to omit no incidents that can be found concerning him, and as our propos'd bounds will not &s;uffer us to enlarge, we &s;hall endeavour to di&s;play, with as much conci&s;ene&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, tho&s;e particulars which may be mo&s;t entertaining to the reader.</P>
<P>He was born in Dublin, November the 30th, 1667, and was carried into England &s;oon after his birth, by his nur&s;e, who being obliged to cro&s;s the &s;ea, and having a nur&s;e's fondne&s;s for the child at her brea&s;t, convey'd him a &s;hip-board without the know|ledge of his mother or relations, and kept him with her at Whitehaven in Cumberland, during her re&s;idence about three-years in that place. This extraordinary event made his return &s;eem as if he had been tran&s;planted to Ireland, rather than that he owed his original exi&s;tence to that &s;oil. But perhaps he tacitly hoped to in&s;pire different nations with a contention for his birth; at lea&s;t in his an|gry moods, when he was peevi&s;h and provoked at the ingratitude of Ireland, he was frequently heard to &s;ay. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am not of this vile country, I am an Engli&s;hman.'</Q> Such an a&s;&s;ertion tho' meant figu|ratively, was often received literally; and the re|port was &s;till farther propagated by Mr. Pope, who in one of his letters has this expre&s;&s;ion. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Tho' one, or two of our friends are gone, &s;ince you &s;aw your native country, there remain a few.'</Q> But doctor Swift, in his cooler hours, never denied his country: On the contrary he frequently mentioned, and point|ed out, the hou&s;e where he was born.</P>
<P>The other &s;ugge&s;tion concerning the illegitimacy of his birth, is equally fal&s;e. Sir William Temple was employed as a mini&s;ter abroad, from the year
<PB N="75" REF="80">
1665, to the year 1670; fir&s;t at Bru&s;&s;els, and after|wards at the Hague, as appears by his corre&s;pond|ence with the earl of Arlington, and other mi|ni&s;ters of &s;tate. So that Dr. Swift's mother, who never cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, except from England to Ire|land, was out of all po&s;&s;ibility of a per&s;onal cor|re&s;pondence with Sir William Temple, till &s;ome years after her &s;on's birth. Dr. Swift's ance&s;tors were per&s;ons of decent and reputable characters. His grand-father was the Revd. Mr. Thomas Swift, vicar of Goodridge, near Ro&s;s in Hereford&s;hire. He enjoyed a paternal e&s;tate in that county, which is &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his great-grand&s;on, Dean Swift, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> He died in the year 1658, leaving five &s;ons, Godwin, Thomas, Dryden, Jonathan, and Adam.</P>
<P>Two of them only, Godwin and Jonathan, left &s;ons. Jonathan married Mrs. Abigail Erick of Leice&s;ter&s;hire, by whom he had one daughter and a &s;on. The daughter was born in the fir&s;t year of Mr. Swift's marriage; but he lived not to &s;ee the birth of his &s;on, who was born two months after his death, and became afterwards the famous Dean of St. Patrick's.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of Mr. Jonathan Swift's income had depended upon agencies, and other employ|ments of that kind; &s;o that mo&s;t of his fortune pe|ri&s;hed with him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Orrery, page 6.</NOTE>, and the remainder being the only &s;upport that his widow could enjoy, the care, tuition, and expence of her two children devolved upon her hu&s;band's elder brother, Mr. Godwin Swift, who voluntarily became their guardian, and &s;upplied the lo&s;s which they had &s;u&s;tained in a father.</P>
<P>The faculties of the mind appear and &s;hine forth at different ages in different men. The infancy of Dr. Swift pa&s;s'd on without any marks of di&s;tinction. At
<PB N="76" REF="81">
&s;ix years old he was &s;ent to &s;chool at Kilkenny, and about eight years afterwards he was entered a &s;tudent of Trinity-College in Dublin. He lived there in perfect regularity, and under an entire obe|dience to the &s;tatutes; but the moro&s;ene&s;s of his temper rendered him very unacceptable to his com|panions, &s;o that he was little regarded, and le&s;s be|loved, nor were the academical exerci&s;es agreeable to his genius. He held logic and metaphy&s;ics in the utmo&s;t contempt; and he &s;carce con&s;idered ma|thematics, and natural philo&s;ophy, unle&s;s to turn them into ridicule. The &s;tudies which he followed were hi&s;tory and poetry. In the&s;e he made a great progre&s;s, but to all other branches of &s;cience, he had given &s;o very little application, that when he appeared as a candidate for the degree of batchelor of arts, he was &s;et a&s;ide on account of in&s;ufficiency. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'This, &s;ays lord Orrery, is a &s;urpri&s;ing incident in his life, but it is undoubtedly true; and even at la&s;t he obtained his admi&s;&s;ion Speciali Grati&acirc;. A phra&s;e which in that univer&s;ity carries with it the utmo&s;t marks of reproach. It is a kind of di&s;|honourable degree, and the record of it (notwith|&s;tanding Swift's pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed character throughout the learned world) mu&s;t for ever re|main again&s;t him in the academical regi&s;ter at Dublin.'</P></Q></P>
<P>The more early di&s;appointments happen in life, the deeper impre&s;&s;ion they make upon the heart. Swift was full of indignation at the treatment he received in Dublin; and therefore re&s;olved to pur|&s;ue his &s;tudies at Oxford. However, that he might be admitted Ad Eundem, he was obliged to carry with him the te&s;timonium of his degree. The ex|pre&s;&s;ion Speciali Grati&acirc; is &s;o peculiar to the uni|ver&s;ity of Dublin, that when Mr. Swift exhibited
<PB N="77" REF="82">
his te&s;timonium at Oxford, the members of the En|gli&s;h univer&s;ity concluded, that the words Speciali Grati&acirc; mu&s;t &s;ignity a degree conferred in reward of extraordinary diligence and learning. It as natural to imagine that he did not try to undeceive them; he was entered in Hart-Hall, now Hartford-College, where he re&s;ided till he took his degree of ma&s;ter of arts in the year 1691.</P>
<P>Dr. Swift's uncle, on whom he had placed his chief dependance, dying in the Revolution year, he was &s;upported chiefly by the bounty of Sir William Temple, to who&s;e lady he was a di&s;tant relation. Acts of genero&s;ity &s;eldom meet with their ju&s;t ap|plau&s;e. Sir William Temple's friend&s;hip was im|mediately con&s;trued to proceed from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he was the real father of Mr. Swift, otherwi&s;e it was thought impo&s;&s;ible he could be &s;o uncommonly munificent to a young man, &s;o di&s;tantly related to his wife. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'I am not quite certain, (&s;ays his noble Biogra|pher) that Swift him&s;elf did not acquie&s;ce in the calumny; perhaps like Alexander, he thought the natural &s;on of Jupiter would appear greater than the legitimate &s;on of Philip.'</P></Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as Swift quitted the univer&s;ity, he lived with Sir William Temple as his friend, and dome&s;tic companion. When he had been about two years in the family of his patron, he contracted a very long, and dangerous illne&s;s, by eating an immoderate quantity of fruit. To this &s;urfeit he u&s;ed to a&s;cribe the giddine&s;s in his head, which, with intermi&s;&s;ions &s;ometimes of a longer, and &s;ometimes of a &s;horter continuance, pur&s;ued him till it &s;eemed to com|pleat its conque&s;t, by rendering him the exact image of one of his own STRULDBRUGGS; a mi|&s;erable &s;pectacle, devoid of every appearance of human nature, except the outward form.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="83">
After Swift had &s;ufficiently recovered to travel, he went into Ireland to try the effects of his native air; and he found &s;o much benefit by the journey, that pur&s;uant to his own inclinations he &s;oon re|turned into England, and was again mo&s;t affection|ately received by Sir William Temple, who&s;e hou&s;e was now at Sheen, where he was often vi&s;ited by King William. Here Swift had frequent oppor|tunities of conver&s;ing with that prince; in &s;ome of which conver&s;ations the king offered to make him a captain of hor&s;e: An offer, which in his &s;plenetic di&s;po&s;itions, he always &s;eemed &s;orry to have refu&s;ed; but at that time he had re&s;olved within his own mind to take orders, and during his whole life his re&s;o|lutions, like the decrees of fate, were immoveable. Thus determined, he again went over to Ireland, and immediately inli&s;ted him&s;elf under the banner of the church. He was recommended to lord Capel, then Lord-Deputy, who gave him, the fir&s;t vacancy, a prebend, of which the income was about a hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>Swift &s;oon grew weary of a preferment, which to a man of his ambition was far from being &s;uffici|ently con&s;iderable. He re&s;igned his prebend in fa|vour of a friend, and being &s;ick of &s;olitude he re|turned to Sheen, were he lived dome&s;tically as u&s;ual, till the death of Sir William Temple; who be&s;ides a legacy in money, left to him the care and tru&s;t of publi&s;hing his po&s;thumous works.</P>
<P>During Swift's re&s;idence with Sir William Temple he became intimately acquainted with a lady, whom he has di&s;tingui&s;hed, and often celebrated, under the name of Stella. The real name of this lady was John|&s;on. She was the daughter of Sir William Temple's &s;teward; and the concealed but undoubted wife of doctor Swift. Sir William Temple bequeathed her in his will 1000 l. as an acknowledgment of her father's faithful &s;ervices. In the year 1716 &s;he was married to doctor Swift, by doctor A&s;he, then bi|&s;hop of Clogher.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="84">
The reader mu&s;t ob&s;erve, there was a long inter|val between the commencement of his acquaintance with Stella, and the time of making her his wife, for which (as it appears he was fond of her from the beginning of their intimacy) no other cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned, but that the &s;ame unaccountable humour, which had &s;o long detained him from marrying, prevented him from acknowledging her after &s;he was his wife. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Stella (&s;ays lord Orrery) was a mo&s;t amiable woman both in mind and per&s;on: She had an elevated under&s;tanding, with all the delicacy, and &s;oftne&s;s of her own &s;ex. Her voice, however &s;weet in it&s;elf, was &s;till rendered more harmo|nious by what &s;he &s;aid. Her wit was poignant without &s;everity: Her manners were humane, polite, ea&s;y and unre&s;erved.&mdash;Wherever &s;he came, &s;he attracted attention and e&s;teem. As virtue was her guide in morality, &s;incerity was her guide in religion. She was con&s;tant, but not o&s;tentatious in her devotions: She was remark|ably prudent in her conver&s;ation: She had great &s;kill in mu&s;ic; and was perfectly well ver&s;ed in all the le&s;&s;er arts that employ a lady's lei&s;ure. Her wit allowed her a fund of perpetual chear|fulne&s;s within proper limits. She exactly an&s;wer|ed the de&s;cription of Penelope in Homer.
<Q><L>' A woman, lovelie&s;t of the lovely kind,</L>
<L>' In body perfect, and compleat in mind.'</L></Q></P></Q></P>
<P>Such was this amiable lady, yet, with all the&s;e advantages, &s;he could never prevail on Dr. Swift to acknowledge her openly as his wife. A great ge|nius mu&s;t tread in unbeaten paths, and deviate from the common road of life; otherwi&s;e a diamond of &s;o much lu&s;ter might have been publickly produced, although it had been fixed within the collet of matri|mony:
<PB N="80" REF="85">
But that which dimini&s;hed the value of this ine&s;timable jewel in Swift's eye was the &s;ervile &s;tate of her father.</P>
<P>Ambition and pride, the predominant principles which directed all the actions of Swift, conquered rea&s;on and ju&s;tice; and the vanity of boa&s;ting &s;uch a wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the greater vanity of keeping free from a low alliance. Dr. Swift and Mrs. John&s;on continued the &s;ame oeconomy of life after marriage, which they had pur&s;ued before it. They lived in &s;eparate hou&s;es; nothing appear|ed in their behaviour incon&s;i&s;tent in their decorum, and beyond the limits of platonic love. However unaccountable this renunciation of marriage rites might appear to the world, it certainly aro&s;e, not from any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a too near con&s;anguinity between him and Mrs. John&s;on, although the gene|ral voice of &s;ome was willing to make them both the natural children of Sir William Temple. Dr. Swift, (&s;ays lord Orrery) was not of that opinion, for the &s;ame fal&s;e pride which induced him to deny the legitimate daughter of an ob&s;cure &s;ervant, might have prompted him to own the natural daugh|ter of Sir William Temple<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The authors of the Monthly Review have ju&s;tly remark|ed, that this ob&s;ervation of his lord&s;hip's &s;eems premature. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The &s;ame public rumour, &s;ay they, that made HER Sir Wil|liam Temple's daughter, made HIM al&s;o Sir William's &s;on: Therefore he (Swift) could never with decency, have ac|knowledged Mrs. John&s;on as his wife, while that rumour continued to retain any degree of credit; and if there had been really no foundation for it, &s;urely it might have been no very hard ta&s;k to obviate its force, by producing the nece&s;&s;ary proofs and circum&s;tances of his birth: Yet, we do not find that ever this was done, either by the Dean or his relations.'</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is natural to imagine, that a woman of Stella's delicacy mu&s;t repine at &s;uch an extraordinary &s;itua|tion. The outward honours &s;he received are as fre|quently be&s;towed upon a mi&s;tre&s;s as a wife; &s;he
<PB N="81" REF="86">
was ab&s;olutely virtuous, and was yet obliged to &s;ubmit to all the appearances of vice. Inward anxiety affected by degrees the calmne&s;s of her mind, and the &s;trength of her body. She died to|wards the end of January 1727, ab&s;olutely de&s;troy'd by the peculiarity of her fate; a fate which per|haps &s;he could not have incurred by an alliances with any other per&s;on in the world.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Sir William Temple, Swift came to London, and took the earlie&s;t opportunity of delivering a petition to King William, under the claim of a promi&s;e made by his maje&s;ty to Sir William Temple, that Mr. Swift &s;hould have the fir&s;t vacancy which might happen among the pre|bends of We&s;tmin&s;ter or Canterbury. But this promi&s;e was either totally forgotten, or the petition which Mr. Swift pre&s;ented was drowned amid&s;t the clamour of more urgent addre&s;&s;es. From this fir&s;t di&s;|appointment may be dated that bitterne&s;s towards kings and courtiers, which is to be found &s;o uni|ver&s;ally di&s;per&s;ed throughout his works.</P>
<P>After a long and fruitle&s;s attendance at Whitehall, Swift reluctantly gave up all thoughts of a &s;ettlement in England: Pride prevented him from remaining longer in a &s;tate of &s;ervility and contempt. He complied therefore with an invitation from the earl of Berkley (appointed one of the Lords Ju&s;tices in Ireland) to attend him as his chaplain, and private &s;ecretary.&mdash;Lord Berkley landed near Waterford, and Mr. Swift acted as &s;ecretary during the whole journey to Dublin. But another of lord Berkley's attendants, who&s;e name was Bu&s;h, had by this time in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the earl's favour, and had whi&s;pered to his lord&s;hip, that the po&s;t of &s;ecretary was not proper for a clergyman, to whom only church preferments could be &s;uitable or advantageous. Lord Berkley li&s;tened perhaps too attentively to the&s;e in&s;inuations, and making &s;ome &s;light apology
<PB N="82" REF="87">
to Mr. Swift, dive&s;ted him of that office, and be|&s;towed it upon Mr. Bu&s;h.</P>
<P>Here again was another di&s;appointment, and a fre&s;h object of indignation. The treatment was thought injurious, and Swift expre&s;&s;ed his &s;en&s;ibility of it in a &s;hort but &s;atyrical co|py of ver&s;es, intitled the Di&s;covery. How|ever, during the government of the Earls of Berkley and Galway, who were jointly Lords Ju&s;tices of Ireland, two livings, Laracor and Rathbeggan, were given to Mr. Swift. The fir&s;t of the&s;e recto|ries was worth about 200, and the latter about 60 l. a year; and they were the only church preferments which he enjoyed till he was appointed Dean of St. Patrick's, in the year 1713.</P>
<P>Lord Orrery gives the following in&s;tances of his humour and of his pride.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his two livings, he went to re&s;ide at Laracor, and gave public notice to his pari&s;hioners, that he would read prayers on every Wedne&s;day and Friday. Upon the &s;ub&s;equent Wedne&s;day the bell was rung, and the rector attended in his de&s;k, when after having &s;at &s;ome time, and finding the congregation to con&s;i&s;t only of him&s;elf and his clerk Roger, he began with great compo&s;ure and gravity; but with a turn pe|culiar to him&s;elf. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Dearly beloved</HI> Roger, <HI>the &s;crip|ture moveth you and me in &s;undry places, &amp;c.</HI>"</Q> And then proceeded regularly thro' the whole &s;ervice. This trifling circum&s;tance &s;erves to &s;hew, that he could not re&s;i&s;t a vein of humour, whenever he had an opportunity of exerting it.</P>
<P>The following is the in&s;tance of his pride. While Swift was chaplain to lord Berkley, his only &s;i&s;ter, by the con&s;ent and approbation of her uncle and relations, was married to a man in trade, who&s;e fortune, character, and &s;ituation were e&s;teemed by all her friends, and &s;uitable to her in every re&s;pect.
<PB N="83" REF="88">
But the marriage was intirely di&s;agreeable to her brother. It &s;eemed to interrupt tho&s;e ambitious views he had long &s;ince formed: He grew outragi|ous at the thoughts of being brother-in law to a trade&s;man. He utterly refu&s;ed all reconciliation with his &s;i&s;ter; nor would he even li&s;ten to the en|treaties of his mother, who came over to Ireland under the &s;tronge&s;t hopes of pacifying his anger; having in every other in&s;tance found him a dutiful and obedient &s;on: But his pride was not to be con|quered, and Mrs. Swift finding her &s;on inflexible, ha&s;tened back to Leice&s;ter, where &s;he continued till her death.</P>
<P>During his mother's life time, he &s;carce ever fail|ed to pay her an annual vi&s;it. But his manner of tra|velling was as &s;ingular as any other of his actions. He often went in a waggon, but more frequently walked from Holyhead to Leice&s;ter, London, or any other part of England. He generally cho&s;e to dine with waggoners, o&s;tlers, and per&s;ons of that rank; and he u&s;ed to lye at night in hou&s;es where he found written over the door, Lodgings for a Penny. He delighted in &s;cenes of low life. The vulgar dialect was not only a fund of humour for him; but &s;eems to have been acceptable to his nature, as appears from the many filthy ideas, and indecent expre&s;&s;ions found throughout his works.</P>
<P>A &s;trict re&s;idence in a country place was not in the lea&s;t &s;uitable to the re&s;tle&s;s temper of Swift. He was perpetually making excur&s;ions not only to Dublin, and other places in Ireland, but likewi&s;e to London; &s;o rambling a di&s;po&s;ition occa&s;ioned to him a con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The rich deanery of Derry became vacant at this time, and was intended for him by lord Berkley, if Dr. King, then bi&s;hop of Derry, and afterwards archbi&s;hop of Dublin, had not interpo&s;ed; entreating with great earne&s;tne&s;s, that the deanery might be given to &s;ome grave and elderly divine, rather than to &s;o young a man;

<P>Swift was accordingly &s;et a&s;ide on account of youth, and from the year 1702, to the change of the mini&s;try in the year 1710, few circum&s;tances of his life can be found &s;ufficiently material to be in&s;erted here. From this la&s;t period, 'till the death of Queen Anne, we find him fighting on the &s;ide of the Tories, and maintaining their cau&s;e in pam|phlets, poems, and weekly papers. In one of his letters to Mr. Pope he has this expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have conver&s;ed, in &s;ome freedom, with more mini&s;ters of &s;tate, of all parties, than u&s;ually happens to men of my level; and, I confe&s;s, in their capacity as mini&s;ters I look upon them as a race of people, who&s;e acquaintance no man would court otherwi&s;e, than on the &s;core of va|nity and ambition.'</Q> A man always appears of more con&s;equence to him&s;elf, than he is in rea|lity to any other per&s;on. Such, perhaps, was the ca&s;e of Dr. Swift. He knew how u&s;eful he was to the admini&s;tration in general; and in one of his let|ters he mentions, that the place of hi&s;toriographer was intended for him; but in this particular he flat|tered him&s;elf; at lea&s;t, he remained without any pre|ferment 'till the year 1713, when he was made dean of St. Patrick's. In point of power and revenue, &s;uch a deanery might be e&s;teemed no incon&s;idera|ble promotion; but to an ambitious mind, who&s;e perpetual view was a &s;ettlement in England, a dignity in any other country mu&s;t appear only a
<PB N="85" REF="90">
profitable and an honourable kind of bani&s;hment. It is very probable, that the temper of Swift might occa&s;ion his Engli&s;h friends to wi&s;h him promoted at a di&s;tance. His &s;pirit was ever untractable. The motions of his genius were often irregular. He a&s;&s;umed more of the air of a patron, than of a friend. He affected rather to dictate than ad|vi&s;e. He was elated with the appearance of en|joying mini&s;terial confidence. He enjoyed the &s;ha|dow indeed, but the &s;ub&s;tance was detained from him. He was employed, not entru&s;ted; and at the &s;ame time he imagined him&s;elf a &s;ubtle diver, who dextrou&s;ly &s;hot down into the profounde&s;t regions of politics, he was &s;uffered only to &s;ound the &s;hal|lows neare&s;t the &s;hore, and was &s;carce admitted to de&s;cend below the froth at the top. Swift was one of tho&s;e &s;trange kind of Tories, who lord Bolingbroke, in his letter to Sir William Wynd|ham, calls the Whim&s;icals, that is, they were Tories attach'd to the Hanoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This kind of Tory is &s;o incongruous a creature, that it is a wonder ever &s;uch a one exi&s;ted. Mrs. Pilkington informs us, that Swift had written A Defence of the la&s;t Mini&s;ters of Queen Anne, from an inten|tion of re&s;toring the Pretender, which Mr. Pope advi&s;ed him to de&s;troy, as not one word of it was true. Bolingbroke, by far the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed man in that mini&s;try (for Oxford was, in compa|ri&s;on of him, a &s;tate&s;man of no compa&s;s) certain|ly aimed at the re&s;toration of the exiled family, however he might di&s;gui&s;e to &s;ome people his real intentions, under the ma&s;que of being a Hanove|rian Tory. This &s;erves to corroberate the ob&s;er|vation which lord Orrery makes of Swift: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that he was employed, not tru&s;ted, &amp;c.'</Q></P>
<P>By reflexions of this &s;ort, &s;ays lord Orrery, we may account for his di&s;appointment of an Engli&s;h bi|&s;hopric. A di&s;appointment, which, be imagined, he owed to a joint application made again&s;t him
<PB N="86" REF="91">
to the Queen, by Dr. Sharp, archbi&s;hop of York, and by a lady of the highe&s;t rank and character. Archbi&s;hop Sharpe, according to Swift's account, had repre&s;ented him to the Queen as a per&s;on, who was no Chri&s;tian; the great lady had &s;up|ported the a&s;&s;ertion, and the Queen, upon &s;uch a&s;|&s;urances, had given away the bi&s;hopric, contrary to her Maje&s;ty's intentions. Swift kept him&s;elf, indeed, within &s;ome tolerable bounds when he &s;poke of the Queen; but his indignation knew no limits when he mentioned the archbi&s;hop, or the lady.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t people are fond of a &s;ettlement in their native country, but Swift had not much rea&s;on to rejoice in the land where his lot had fallen; for upon his arrival in Ireland to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the deanery, he found the violence of party raging in that kingdom to the highe&s;t degree. The common people were taught to con&s;ider him as a Jacobite, and they proceeded &s;o far in their dete&s;tation, as to throw &s;tones and dirt at him as he pa&s;&s;ed thro' the &s;treets. The chapter of St. Patrick's, like the re&s;t of the kingdom, received him with great re|luctance. They oppo&s;ed him in every point he propo&s;ed. They avoided him as a pe&s;tilence, and re&s;i&s;ted him as an invader and an enemy to his country. Such was his fir&s;t reception, as dean of St. Patrick's. Fewer talents, and le&s;s firmne&s;s mu&s;t have yielded to &s;o outrageous an oppo&s;ition. He had &s;een enough of human nature to be con|vinced that the pa&s;&s;ions of low, &s;elf-intere&s;ted minds ebb and flow continually. They love they know not whom, they hate they know not why. They are captivated by words, guided by names, and governed by accidents. But to &s;hew the &s;trange revolutions in this world, Dr. Swift, who was now the dete&s;tation of the Iri&s;h rabble, lived to be af|terwards the mo&s;t ab&s;olute monarch over them, that ever governed men. His fir&s;t &s;tep was to re|duce to rea&s;on and obedience his revd. brethren
<PB N="87" REF="92">
the chapter of St. Patrick's; in which he &s;ucceed|ed &s;o perfectly, and &s;o &s;peedily, that, in a &s;hort time after his arrival, not one member in that bo|dy offered to contradict him, even in trifles: on the contrary, they held him in the highe&s;t re&s;pect and veneration, &s;o that he &s;at in the Chapter-Hou&s;e, like Jupiter in the Synod of the Gods.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1714 Swift re|turned to England. He found his great friends, who &s;at in the &s;eat of power, much di&s;united a|mong them&s;elves. He &s;aw the Queen declining in her health, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in her &s;ituation; while faction was exerting it&s;elf, and gathering new &s;trength every day. He exerted the utmo&s;t of his &s;kill to unite the mini&s;ters, and to cement the apertures of the &s;tate: but he found his pains fruit|le&s;s, his arguments unavailing, and his endea|vours, like the &s;tone of Si&s;yphus, rolling back upon him&s;elf. He retired to a friend's hou&s;e in Berk|&s;hire, where he remained 'till the Queen died. So fatal an event terminated all his views in Eng|land, and made him return as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to his deanery in Ireland, oppre&s;&s;ed with grief and di&s;content. His hopes in England were now cru&s;hed for ever. As Swift was well known to have been attached to the Queen's la&s;t mini&s;try, he met with &s;everal indignities from the populace, and, indeed, was equally abu&s;ed by per&s;ons of all ranks and denominations. Such a treatment &s;oured his tem|per, confined his acquaintance, and added bitter|ne&s;s to his &s;tile.</P>
<P>From the year 1714, 'till he appeared in the year 1720 a champion for Ireland, again&s;t Wood's halfpence, his &s;pirit of politics and patrioti&s;m was kept almo&s;t clo&s;ely confined within his own brea&s;t. Idlene&s;s and trifles engro&s;&s;ed too many of his lei|&s;ure hours; fools and &s;ycophants too much of his conver&s;ation. His attendance upon the public &s;er|vice of the church was regular and uninterrupted;
<PB N="88" REF="93">
and indeed regularity was peculiar to all his ac|tions, even in the meere&s;t trifles. His hours of walking and reading never varied. His motions were guided by his watch, which was &s;o con&s;tant|ly held in his hand, or placed before him on the table, that he &s;eldom deviated many minutes in the revolution of his exerci&s;es and employments. In the year 1720 he began to re-a&s;&s;ume, in &s;ome degree, the character of a political writer. A &s;mall pamphlet in defence of the Iri&s;h Manufac|tures was his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay in Ireland in that kind of writing, and to that pamphlet he owed the turn of the popular tide in his favour. It was entitled. A Propo&s;al for the Univer&s;al U&s;e of Iri&s;h Manu|facture in Clothes and Furniture of Hou&s;es, &amp;c. utterly rejecting and renouncing every thing weara|ble that comes from England. This propo&s;al im|mediately rai&s;ed a very violent flame. The Printer was pro&s;ecuted, and the pro&s;ecution had the &s;ame effect, which generally attends tho&s;e kind of mea|&s;ures. It added fuel to flame. But his greate&s;t enemies mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the pamphlet is written in the &s;tile of a man who had the good of his country neare&s;t his heart, who &s;aw her errors, and wi&s;hed to correct them; who felt her oppre&s;&s;ions, and wi&s;hed to relieve them; and who had a de&s;ire to rouze and awaken an indolent nation from a lethargic di&s;po&s;ition; that might prove fatal to her con&s;titution. This temporary oppo&s;ition but in|crea&s;ed the &s;tream of his popularity. He was now looked upon in a new light, and was di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the title of THE DEAN, and &s;o high a de|gree of popularity did he attain, as to become an arbitrator, in di&s;putes of property, among&s;t his neighbours; nor did any man dare to appeal from his opinion, or murmur at his decrees.</P>
<P>But the popular effection, which the dean had hitherto acquired, may be &s;aid not to have been univer&s;al, 'till the publication of the Drapier's
<PB N="89" REF="94">
Letters, which made all ranks, and all profe&s;&s;ions unanimous in his applau&s;e. The occa&s;ion of tho&s;e letters was, a &s;carcity of copper coin in Ireland, to &s;o great a degree, that, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, the chief manufacturers throughout the kingdom were obliged to pay their workmen in pieces of ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, or in other tokens of &s;uppo&s;itious value. Such a method was very di&s;advantageous to the lower parts of traffic, and was in general an impediment to the commerce of the &s;tate. To remedy this e|vil, the late King granted a patent to one Wood, to coin, during the term of fourteen years, far|things and halfpence in England, for the u&s;e of Ireland, to the value of a certain &s;um &s;pecified. The&s;e halfpence and farthings were to be received by tho&s;e per&s;ons, who would voluntarily accept them. But the patent was thought to be of &s;uch dangerous con&s;equence to the public, and of &s;uch exorbitant advantage to the patentee, that the dean, under the character of M. B. Drapier, wrot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Letter to the People, warning them not to accept Wood's halfpence and farthings, as current coin. This fir&s;t letter was &s;ucceeded by &s;everal others to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, all which are in&s;erted in his works.</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of the Drapier's trumpet, a &s;pirit aro&s;e among the people. Per&s;ons of all ranks, parties and denominations, were convinced that the admi&s;&s;ion of Wood's copper mu&s;t prove fatal to the commonwealth. The Papi&s;t, the Fanatic, the Tory, the Whig, all li&s;ted them&s;elves volun|teers, under the banner of the Drapier, and were all equally zealous to &s;erve the common cau&s;e. Much heat, and many fiery &s;peeches again&s;t the admini|&s;tration were the con&s;equence of this union; nor had the flames been allayed, notwith&s;tanding threats and proclamations, had not the coin been totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and Wood withdrawn his patent. The name of Augu&s;tus was not be&s;towed upon
<PB N="90" REF="95">
Octavius Cae&s;ar with more univer&s;al approbation, than the name of the Drapier was be&s;towed upon the dean. He had no &s;ooner a&s;&s;umed his new cognomen, than he became the idol of the people of Ireland, to a degree of devotion, that in the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious coun|try, &s;carce any idol ever obtained. Libations to his health were poured out as frequent as to the im|mortal memory of King William. His effigies was painted in every &s;treet in Dublin. Acclama|tions and vows for his pro&s;perity attended his foot&s;teps wherever he pa&s;&s;ed. He was con&s;ulted in all points relating to dome&s;tic policy in general, and to the trade of Ireland in particular; but he was more immediately looked upon as the legi&s;la|tor of the Weavers, who frequently came in a body, con&s;i&s;ting of 40 or 50 chiefs of their trade, to receive his advice in &s;ettling the rates of their manufactures, and the wages of their journeymen. He received their addre&s;s with le&s;s maje&s;ty than &s;ternne&s;s, and ranging his &s;ubjects in a circle round his parlour, &s;poke as copiou&s;ly, and with as little difficulty and he&s;itation, to the &s;everal points in which they &s;upplicated his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as if trade had been the only &s;tudy and employment of his life. When elections were depending for the city of Dublin, many Corporations refu&s;ed to declare them&s;elves, 'till they had con&s;ulted his &s;entiments and inclinations, which were punctually followed with equal chearfulne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of power, and popular admiration, he remained 'till he lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es; a lo&s;s which he &s;eemed to fore&s;ee, and prophetically lamented to many of his friends. The total deprivation of his &s;en&s;es came upon him by degrees. In the year 1736 he was &s;eized with a violent fit of giddine&s;s; he was at that time writing a &s;atirical poem, called The Legion Club; but he found the effects of his giddine&s;s &s;o dreadful, that he left the poem unfi|ni&s;hed, and never afterwards attempted a compo&s;i|tion,
<PB N="91" REF="96">
either in ver&s;e or pro&s;e. However, his con|ver&s;ation &s;till remained the &s;ame, lively and &s;e|vere, but his memory gradually grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and as that decrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, he grew every day more &s;retful and impatient. In the year 1741, his friends found his pa&s;&s;ions &s;o violent and ungover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">able, his memory &s;o decayed, and his rea&s;on &s;o depraved, that they took the utmo&s;t precautions to keep all &s;trangers from approaching him; for, 'till then, he had not appeared totally incapable of conver&s;ation. But early in the year 1742, the &s;mall remains of his under&s;tanding became entirely confu&s;ed, and the violence of his rage increa&s;ed ab&s;olutely to a degree of madne&s;s. In this mi&s;erable &s;tate he &s;eemed to be appointed the fir&s;t inhabitant of his own Ho&s;pital; e&s;pecially as from an outrageous lunatic, he &s;unk afterwards to a quiet &s;peechle&s;s i|deot, and dragged out the remainder of his life in that helple&s;s &s;ituation. He died towards the latter end of October 1745. The manner of his death was ea&s;y, without the lea&s;t pang, or convul&s;ion; even the rattling of his throat was &s;carce &s;uffici|ent to give an alarm to his attendants, 'till with|in &s;ome very little time before he expired. A man in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his rea&s;on would have wi&s;hed for &s;uch a kind di&s;&s;olution; but Swift was totally in|&s;en&s;ible of happine&s;s, or pain. He had not even the power or expre&s;&s;ion of a child, appearing for &s;ome years before his death, re&s;erved only as an example to mortify human pride, and to re|ver&s;e that fine de&s;cription of human nature, which is given us by the inimitable Shake&s;pear. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'What a piece of work is man! how noble in rea&s;on! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how expre&s;s and admirable! in action how like an an|gel! in apprehen&s;ion how like a God! the beau|ty of the world! the paragon of animals!'</Q> Swift's friends often heard him lament the &s;tate of childhood and idioti&s;m, to which &s;ome of the greate&s;t

He mentioned, as examples within his own time, the duke of Marlborough and lord Somers; and when he cited the&s;e melancholy in&s;tances, it was always with a heavy &s;igh, and with ge&s;tures that &s;hewed great unea&s;ine&s;s, as if he felt an im|pul&s;e of what was to happen to him before he died. He left behind him about twelve thou&s;and pounds, inclu&s;ive of the &s;pecific legacies mentioned in his will, and which may be computed at the &s;um of twelve hundred pounds, &s;o that the remaining ten thou&s;and eight hundred pounds, is entirely appli|cable t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Ho&s;pital for Idiots and Lunatics; an e&s;tabli&s;hment remarkably generous, as tho&s;e who receive the benefit, mu&s;t for ever remain ignorant of their benefactor.</P>

Even in &s;o &s;erious a compo&s;ition, he cannot help indulging him&s;elf in leaving legacies, that carry with them an air of raillery and je&s;t. He di&s;po&s;es of his three be&s;t hats (his be&s;t, his &s;econd be&s;t, and his third be&s;t beaver) with an ironical &s;olemnity, that renders the beque&s;ts ridiculous.

<P>The Dean's poem on his celebrated Vane&s;&s;a, is number'd among the be&s;t of his poetical pieces. Of this lady it will be proper to give &s;ome account, as &s;he was a character as &s;ingular as Swift him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Vane&s;&s;a's real name was E&s;ther Vanhomrich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name is pronounced Vannumery.</NOTE>. She was one of the daughters of Bartholomew Van|homrich, a Dutch merchant of Am&s;terdam; who upon the Revolution went into Ireland, and was ap|pointed by king William a commi&s;&s;ioner of the revenue. The Dutch merchant, by par&s;imony and prudence, had collected a fortune of about 16,000 l. He bequeathed an equal divi&s;ion of it to his wife, and his four children, of which two were &s;ons, and two were daughters. The &s;ons after the death of their father travelled abroad: The elde&s;t died be|yond &s;ea; and the younge&s;t &s;urviving his brother only a &s;hort time, the whole patrimony fell to his two &s;i&s;ters, E&s;ther and Mary.</P>
<P>With this encrea&s;e of wealth, and with heads and hearts elated by affluence, and unre&s;trained by fore-&s;ight or di&s;cretion, the widow Vanhomrich, and her two daughters, quitted their native country for the more elegant plea&s;ures of the Engli&s;h court. During their re&s;idence at London, they lived in a cour&s;e of prodigality, that &s;tretched it&s;elf far be|yond the limits of their income, and reduced them to great di&s;tre&s;s, in the mid&s;t of which the mother died, and the two daughters ha&s;tened in all &s;ecre&s;y back to Ireland, beginning their journey on a Sun|day,
<PB N="96" REF="101">
to avoid the interruption of creditors. Within two years after their arrival in Ireland, Mary the younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter died, and the &s;mall remains of the &s;hipwreck'd fortune center'd in Vane&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>Vanity makes terrible deva&s;tations in a female brea&s;t: Vane&s;&s;a was exce&s;&s;ively vain. She was fond of dre&s;s; impatient to be admired; very romantic in her turn of mind; &s;uperior in her own opinion to all her &s;ex; full of pertne&s;s, gaiety, and pride; not without &s;ome agreeable accompli&s;hments, but far from being either beautiful or genteel: Ambitious at any rate to be e&s;teemed a wit; and with that view always affecting to keep company with wits; a great reader, and a violent admirer of poetry; hap|py in the thoughts of being reputed Swift's con|cubine; but &s;till aiming to be his wife. By nature haughty and di&s;dainful, looking with con|tempt upon her inferiors; and with the &s;miles of &s;elf-approbation upon her equals; but upon Dr. Swift, with the eyes of love: Her love was no doubt founded in vanity.</P>
<P>Though Vane&s;&s;a had exerted all the arts of her &s;ex, to intangle Swift in matrimony; &s;he was yet un&s;ucce&s;sful. She had lo&s;t her reputation, and the narrowne&s;s of her income, and coldne&s;s of her lover contributed to make her mi&s;erable, and to increa&s;e the phren&s;ical di&s;po&s;ition of her mind. In this melancholly &s;ituation &s;he remained &s;everal years, during which time Cadenus (Swift) vi&s;ited her frequently. She often pre&s;s'd him to marry her: His an&s;wers were rather turns of wit, than po&s;itive de|nials; till at la&s;t being unable to &s;u&s;tain the weight of mi&s;ery any longer, &s;he wrote a very tender epi&s;tle to him, in&s;i&s;ting peremptorily upon a &s;erious an&s;wer, and an immediate acceptance, or ab&s;olute refu&s;al of her as his wife. His reply was delivered by his own hand. He brought it with him when he made his final vi&s;it; and throwing down the let|ter
<PB N="97" REF="102">
upon the table with great pa&s;&s;ion, ha&s;tened back to his hou&s;e, carrying in his countenance the frown of anger, and indignation. Vane&s;&s;a did not &s;ur|vive many days the letter delivered to her by Swift, but during that &s;hort interval &s;he was &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed, to cancel a will made in his favour, and to make another, wherein &s;he left her fortune (which by a long retirement was in &s;ome mea&s;ure retrieved) to her two executors, Dr. Berkley the late lord bi&s;hop of Cloyne, and Mr. Mar&s;hal one of the king's Serjeants at law. Thus peri&s;hed under all the agonies of de&s;pair, Mrs. E&s;ther Vanhomrich; a mi&s;erable example of an ill-&s;pent life, fanta&s;tic wit, vi&s;ionary &s;chemes, and female weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange that vanity &s;hould have &s;o great a prevalence in the female brea&s;t, and yet it is cer|tain that to this principle it was owing, that Swift's hou&s;e was often a &s;eraglio of very virtuous women, who attended him from morning till night, with an obedience, an awe, and an a&s;&s;iduity that are &s;eldom paid to the riche&s;t, or the mo&s;t powerful lovers. The&s;e ladies had no doubt a pride in being thought the companions of Swift; but the hours which were &s;pent in his company could not be very plea&s;ant, as his &s;ternne&s;s and authority were continually exerted to keep them in awe.</P>
<P>Lord Orrery has informed us, that Swift took every opportunity to expo&s;e and ridicule Dryden, for which he imagines there mu&s;t have been &s;ome affront given by that great man to Swift. In this particular we can &s;atisfy the reader from authentic information.</P>
<P>When Swift was a young man, and not &s;o well acquainted with the world as he afterwards became, he wrote &s;ome Pindaric Odes. In this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition he &s;ucceeded ill; &s;ublimity and fire, the indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ites in a Pindaric Ode not being his talent. As Mr. Dryden was Swift's kin&s;man, the&s;e odes were &s;hewn to him for his approbation, who &s;aid to him with an unre&s;erved

freedom, and in the candour of a friend, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Cou&s;in Swift, turn your thoughts &s;ome other way, for nature has never formed you for a Pindaric poet.'</Q></P>
<P>Though what Dryden ob&s;erved, might in &s;ome mea&s;ure be true, and Swift perhaps was con&s;cious that he had not abilities to &s;ucceed in that &s;pecies of writing; yet this hone&s;t di&s;&s;ua&s;ive of his kin&s;man he never forgave. The remembrance of it &s;oured his temper, and heated his pa&s;&s;ions, whenever Dry|den's name was mention'd.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now take a view of Swift in his moral life, the di&s;tinction he has obtained in the literary world having rendered all illu&s;trations of his genius needle&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Orrery, throughout his excellent work, from which we have drawn our account of Swift, with his u&s;ual marks of candour, has di&s;played his moral character. In many particulars, the picture he draws of the Dean re&s;embles the portrait of the &s;ame per&s;on as drawn by Mrs. Pilkington. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'I have beheld him (&s;ays his lord&s;hip) in all humours and di&s;po&s;itions, and I have formed various &s;peculations from the &s;everal weakne&s;&s;es to which I ob&s;erved him liable. His capacity, and &s;trength of mind, were undoubtedly equal to any ta&s;k what&s;oever. His pride, his &s;pirit, or his ambition (call it by what name you plea&s;e) was boundle&s;s; but his views were checked in his younger years, and the anxiety of that di&s;appoint|ment had a &s;en&s;ible effect upon all his actions. He was &s;our and &s;evere, but not ab&s;olutely ill|natur'd. He was &s;ociable only to particular friends, and to them only at particular hours. He knew politene&s;s more than he practi&s;ed it. He was a mixture of avarice and genero&s;ity; the former was frequently prevalent, the latter &s;eldom ap|peared unle&s;s excited by compa&s;&s;ion. He was
<PB N="99" REF="104">
open to adulation, and would not, or could not, di&s;tingui&s;h between low flattery and ju&s;t applau&s;e. His abilities rendered him &s;uperior to envy. He was undi&s;gui&s;ed, and perfectly &s;incere. I am in|duced to think that he entered into orders, more from &s;ome private and fixed re&s;olution, than from ab&s;olute choice: Be that as it may, he performed the duties of the church with great punctual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, and a decent degree of devotion. He read pray|ers, rather in a &s;trong nervous voice, than in a graceful manner; and although he has been often accu&s;ed of irreligion, nothing of that kind appear|ed in his conver&s;ation or behaviour. His ca&s;t of mind induced him to think and &s;peak more of politics than religion. His perpetual views were directed towards power; and his chief aim was to be removed to England: But when he found him&s;elf entirely di&s;appointed, he turned his thoughts to oppo&s;ition, and became the Patron of Ireland.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Pilkington has repre&s;ented him as a tyrant in his family, and has di&s;covered in him a violent propen&s;ion to be ab&s;olute in every company where he was. This di&s;po&s;ition, no doubt, made him more feared than loved; but as he had the mo&s;t unbound|ed vanity to gratify, he was plea&s;ed with the &s;er|vility and awe with which inferiors approached him. He may be re&s;embled to an ea&s;tern monarch, who takes delight in &s;urveying his &s;laves, trembling at his approach, and kneeling with reverence at his feet.</P>
<P>Had Swift been born to regal honours, he would doubtle&s;s have bent the necks of his people to the yoke: As a &s;ubject, he was re&s;tle&s;s and turbulent; and though as lord Orrery &s;ays, he was above cor|ruption, yet that virtue was certainly founded on his pride, which di&s;dained every mea&s;ure, and &s;purned every effort in which he him&s;elf was not the prin|cipal.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105">
He was certainly charitable, though it had an unlucky mixture of o&s;tentation in it. One particular act of his charity (not mentioned, except by Mrs. Pilkington, in any account of him yet publi&s;hed) is well worthy of remembrance, prai&s;e, and imita|tion:&mdash;He appropriated the &s;um of five-hundred pounds intirely to the u&s;e of poor trade&s;men and handicraft&s;men, who&s;e hone&s;ty and indu&s;try, he thought merited a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and encouragement: This he lent to them in &s;mall loans, as their exi|gencies required, without any intere&s;t; and they repaid him at &s;o much per week, or month, as their different circum&s;tances be&s;t enabled them.&mdash;To the wealthy let us &s;ay&mdash;<Q>" Abi tu et fac &s;imiliter."</Q></P>

<P>She was the daughter of captain David Trotter, a Scots gentleman, and commander of the royal

navy in the reign of Charles II. He was highly in favour with that prince, who employed him as com|modore in the demolition of Tangier, in the year 1683. Soon after he was &s;ent to convoy the fleet of the Turkey company; when being &s;eized by the plague, then raging at Scanderoon, he died there. His death was an irreparable lo&s;s to his family, who were defrauded of all his effects on board his &s;hip, which were very con&s;iderable, and of all the money which he had advanced to the &s;eamen, during a long voyage: And to add to this misfortune, the gold&s;mith, in who&s;e hands the greate&s;t part of his money was lodged, became &s;oon after a bankrupt.

But queen Anne, upon her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, granted her an annual pen&s;ion of twenty pounds.</P>
<P>Captain Trotter at his death, left only two daugh|ters, the younge&s;t of whom, Catherine, our cele|brated author, was born in London, Augu&s;t 16, 1679. She gave early marks of her genius, and was not pa&s;&s;ed her childhood when &s;he &s;urprized a company of her relations and friends with extem|porary ver&s;es, on an accident which had fallen under her ob&s;ervation in the &s;treet. She both learned to write, and made her&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of the French lan|guage, by her own application and diligence, with|out any in&s;tructor. But &s;he had &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the &s;tudy of the Latin Grammar and Logic, of which latter &s;he drew up an ab&s;tract for her own u&s;e.

removed by her conferences with &s;ome eminent and learned members of the church of England, &s;he followed the dictates of a mi&s;guided con&s;cience, and embraced the Romi&s;h communion, in which &s;he continued till the year 1707.</P>
<P>She was but 14 years of age, when &s;he wrote a copy of ver&s;es upon Mr. Bevil Higgons's &s;ickne&s;s and recovery from the &s;mall pox, which are printed in our author's &s;econd volume. Her next producti|on was a Tragedy called Agnes de Ca&s;tro, which was acted at the Theatre-royal, in 1695, when &s;he was only in her &s;eventeenth year, and printed in 1696. The reputation of this performance, and the ver&s;es which &s;he addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Congreve upon his Mourning Bride, in 1697, were probably the foundation of her acquaintance with that admirable writer.</P>
<P>Her &s;econd Tragedy, intitled Fatal Friend&s;hip, was acted in 1698, at the new Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.

Her dramatic talents not being confined to Tra|gedy, &s;he brought upon the &s;tage, in 1701, a Co|medy called Love at a Lo&s;s; or mo&s;t Votes carry it, publi&s;hed in May that year. In the &s;ame year &s;he gave the public her third Tragedy, intitled, The Unhappy Penitent, acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane. In the dedication to Charles lord Hallifax, &s;he draws the characters of &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent of her predece&s;&s;ors in tragic poetry, with great judgment and preci&s;ion. She ob&s;erves, that Shake&s;pear had all the images of nature pre&s;ent to him, &s;tudied her thoroughly, and boldly copied all her various features: and that though he chiefly exerted him&s;elf on the more ma&s;culine pa&s;&s;ions, it was the choice of his judgment, not the re&s;traint of his genius; and he &s;eems to have de&s;igned tho&s;e few tender moving &s;cenes, which he has given us, as a proof that he could be every way equally admirable. She allows Dryden to have been the mo&s;t univer&s;al genius which this nation ever bred; but thinks that he did not excel in every part; for though he is di&s;tingui&s;hed in mo&s;t of his writings, by greatne&s;s and elevation of thought, yet at the &s;ame time that he commands our admiration of him&s;elf, he little moves our concern for tho&s;e whom he re|pre&s;ents, not being formed for touching the fofter pa&s;&s;ions. On the other hand, Otway, be&s;ides his judicious choice of the fable, had a peculiar art to move compa&s;&s;ion, which, as it is one of the chief ends of Tragedy, he found mo&s;t adapted to his genius; and never venturing where that did not lead him, excelled in the pathetic. And had Lee, as &s;he remarks, con&s;ulted his &s;trength as well, he might have given us more perfect pieces; but aiming at the &s;ublime, in&s;tead of being great, he is extrava|gant; his &s;tile too &s;welling; and if we pur&s;ue him in his flight, he often carries us out of nature. Had he re&s;trained that vain ambition, and intirely applied him&s;elf to de&s;cribe the &s;ofte&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ions (for

<P>But poetry and dramatic writing did not &s;o far engro&s;s the thoughts of our author, but that &s;he &s;ometimes turned them to &s;ubjects of a very differ|ent nature; and at an age when few of the other &s;ex were capable of under&s;tanding the E&s;&s;ay of Hu|man Under&s;tanding, and mo&s;t of them prejudiced again&s;t the novelty of its principles; and though &s;he was at that time engaged in the profe&s;&s;ion of a religion not very favourable to &s;o rational a philo&s;o|phy as that of Mr. Lock; yet &s;he had read that incomparable book, with &s;o clear a comprehen&s;ion, and &s;o unbia&s;&s;ed a judgment, that her own convicti|on of the truth and importance of the notions con|tained in it, led her to endeavour that of others, by removing &s;ome of the objections urged again&s;t them. She drew up therefore a Defence of the E&s;&s;ay, again&s;t &s;ome Remarks which had been pub|li&s;hed again&s;t it in 1667. The author of the&s;e re|marks was never known to Mr. Lock, who ani|madverted upon them with &s;ome marks of chagrin, at the end of his reply to Stillingfleet, 1697. But after the death of the ingenious Dr. Thomas Burnet, ma&s;ter of the Charter-Hou&s;e, it appeared from his papers, that the Remarks were the product of his pen. They were &s;oon followed by &s;econd Remarks, printed the &s;ame year, in vindication of the fir&s;t, again&s;t Mr. Lock's An&s;wer to them; and in 1699, by Third Remarks, addre&s;&s;ed likewi&s;e to Mr. Lock. Mrs. Trotter's Defence of the E&s;&s;ay again&s;t all the&s;e Remarks was fini&s;hed &s;o early as the beginning of December 1701, when &s;he was but 22 years old. But being more apprehen&s;ive of appearing before the great writer whom &s;he defended, than of the public cen&s;ure, and con&s;cious that the name of a woman would be a prejudice again&s;t a work of that nature, &s;he re&s;olved to conceal her&s;elf with the ut|mo&s;t

care. But her title to the reputation of this piece did not continue long a &s;ecret to the world. For Mrs. Burnet, the late wife of Dr. Burnet, bi&s;hop of Sarum, a lady of an uncommon degree of know|ledge, and who&s;e Method of Devotion, which pa&s;|&s;ed through &s;everal editions, is a proof of her ex|emplary piety, and who, as well as that prelate, honoured our author with a particular friend&s;hip, notwith&s;tanding the difference of her religion, being informed that &s;he was engaged in writing, and that it was not poetry, was de&s;irous to know the &s;ubject. This Mrs. Trotter could not deny a lady of her merit, in whom &s;he might &s;afely confide, and who, upon being acquainted with it, &s;hewed an equal &s;ollicitude that the author might not be known. But afterwards finding the performance highly ap|proved by the bi&s;hop her hu&s;band, Mr. Norris of Bemmerton, and Mr. Lock him&s;elf; &s;he thought the rea&s;ons of &s;ecrecy cea&s;ed, and di&s;covered the writer; and in June 1707 returned her thanks to Mrs. Trotter, then in London, for her pre&s;ent of the book, in a letter which does as much honour to her own under&s;tanding, principles and temper, as to her friend, to whom &s;he addre&s;&s;ed it. Dr. Birch has given a copy of this letter.</P>
<P>Mr. Lock likewi&s;e was &s;o highly &s;atisfied with the Defence, (which was perhaps the only piece that appeared in favour of his E&s;&s;ay, except one by Mr. Samuel Bold, rector of Steeple in Dor&s;et|&s;hire, 1699) that being in London, he de&s;ired Mr. King, afterwards lord high chancellor, to make Mrs. Trotter a vi&s;it, and a pre&s;ent of books; and when &s;he had owned her&s;elf, he wrote to her a letter of compliment, a copy of which is in&s;erted in the&s;e memoris.</P>
<P>But while our author continued to &s;hew the world &s;o deep a penetration into &s;ubjects of the mo&s;t diffi|cult and ab&s;tract kind, &s;he was &s;till incapable of extricating her&s;elf from tho&s;e &s;ubtilties and per|plexities
<PB N="110" REF="115">
of argument, which retained her in the church of Rome. And the &s;incerity of her attach|ment to it, in all its outward &s;everities, obliged her to &s;o &s;trict an ob&s;ervance of its fa&s;ts, as proved ex|tremely injurious to her health. Upon which Dr. Denton Nicholas, a very ingenious learned phy&s;i|cian of her acquai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tance, advi&s;ed her to abate of tho&s;e rigours of ab&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ence, as in&s;upportable to a con&s;titution naturally infirm.</P>
<P>She returned to the exerci&s;e of her dramatic geni|us in 1703, and having fixed upon the Revolution of Sweden under Gu&s;tavus Erick&s;on (which has been related in pro&s;e with &s;o much force and beauty by the Abb&eacute; Vertot) for the &s;ubject of a Tragedy, &s;he &s;ent the fir&s;t draught of it to Mr. Congreve, who returned her an an&s;wer, which, on account of the ju&s;t remarks upon the conduct of the drama, well de&s;erves a place here, did it not exceed our propo&s;ed bounds, and therefore we mu&s;t refer the reader to Dr. Birch's account. This Tragedy was acted in 1706, at the Queen's Theatre in the Hay-Market, and was printed in quarto.</P>
<P>By a letter from Mrs. Trotter to her friend George Burnet of Kemnay in Scotland, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> then at Geneva, dated February 2, 1703-4, it appears that &s;he then began to entertain more moderate notions of religi|on, and to abate of her zeal for the church of Rome. Her charitablene&s;s and latitude of &s;entiments &s;eems to have increa&s;ed a-pace, from the farther examina|tion which &s;he was now probably making into the &s;tate of the controver&s;y between the church of Rome and the Prote&s;tants; for in another letter to Mr. Burnet, of Augu&s;t 8, 1704, &s;he &s;peaks to the &s;ubject of religion, with a &s;pirit of moderation un|u&s;ual in the communion of which &s;he &s;till profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'I wi&s;h, (&s;ays &s;he) there was no di&s;tinction of churches; and then I doubt not there would be

And I believe it is generally true, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t bigotted to a &s;ect, or mo&s;t rigid and preci&s;e in their forms and outward di&s;cipline, are mo&s;t negligent of the moral duties, which certainly are the main end of religion. I have ob&s;erved this &s;o often, both-in private per&s;ons and public &s;ocieties, that I am apt to &s;u&s;pect it every where.'</P></Q></P>
<P>The victory at Blenheim, which exerci&s;ed the pens of Mr. Addi&s;on and Mr. John Philips, who&s;e poems on that occa&s;ion divided the admiration of the public, tempted Mrs. Trotter to write a copy of ver&s;es to the duke of Marlborough, upon his re|turn from his glorious campaign in Germany, De|cember, 1704. But being doubtful with re&s;pect to the publication of them, &s;he &s;ent them in manu|&s;cript to his grace; and received for an&s;wer, that the duke and duche&s;s, and the lord trea&s;urer Godol|phin, with &s;everal others to whom they were &s;hewn, were greatly plea&s;ed with them; and that good judges of poetry had declared, that there were &s;ome lines in them &s;uperior to any that had been written on the &s;ubject. Upon this encouragement &s;he &s;ent the poem to the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The high degree of favour with which &s;he was honoured by the&s;e illu&s;trious per&s;ons, gave her, about this time, hopes of &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment of her fortune, which had hitherto been extremely narrow and precarious. But though &s;he failed of &s;uch an
<PB N="112" REF="117">
e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;he &s;ucceeded in 1705, in another point, which was a temporary relief to her. This particular appears from one of her letters printed in the &s;econd volume; but of what nature or a|mount this relief was, we do not find.</P>
<P>Her enquiries into the nature of true religi|on were attended with their natural and u&s;ual effects, in opening and enlarging her notions beyond the contracted pale of her own church. For in her letter of the 7th of July 1705, to Mr. Burnet, &s;he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">'I am zealous to have you a|gree with me in this one article, that all good chri&s;tians are of the &s;ame religion; a &s;entiment which I &s;incerely confe&s;s, how little &s;oever it is countenanced by the church of Rome.'</Q> And in the latter end of the following year, or the begin|ning of 1707, her doubts about the Romi&s;h reli|gion, which &s;he had &s;o many years profe&s;&s;ed, hav|ing led her to a thorough examination of the grounds of it, by con&s;ulting the be&s;t books on both fides of the que&s;tion, and advi&s;ing with men of the be&s;t judgment, the re&s;ult was a conviction of the fal&s;ene&s;s of the preten&s;ions of that church, and a return to that of England, to which &s;he ad|hered during the re&s;t of her life. In the cour&s;e of this enquiry, the great and leading que&s;tion concerning A Guide in Controver&s;y, was particu|larly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by her; and the two letters which &s;he wrote upon it, the fir&s;t to Mr. Bennet, a Ro|mi&s;h prie&s;t, and the &s;econd to Mr. H&mdash;, who had procured an an&s;wer to that letter from a &s;tranger, Mr. Bennet's indi&s;po&s;ition preventing him from returning one, were thought &s;o valuable on account of the &s;trength and per&s;picuity of rea&s;on|ing, as well as their conci&s;ene&s;s, that &s;he con|&s;ented to the importunity of her friends, for their publication in June 1707, under the following ti|tle, A Di&s;cour&s;e concerning a Guide in Contro|ver&s;ies; in two Letters: Written to one of the
<PB N="113" REF="118">
Church of Rome, by a Per&s;on lately converted from that Communion; a later edition of them being &s;ince printed at Edinburgh in 1728 in 8vo. Bi&s;hop Burnet wrote the preface to them, though without his name to it; and he ob&s;erves, that they might be of u&s;e to &s;uch of the Roman Ca|tholics as are per&s;waded, that tho&s;e who deny the infallibility of their church, take away all certain|ty of the Chri&s;tian religion, or of the authority of the &s;criptures. This is the main topic of tho&s;e two letters, and the point was con&s;idered by our author as of &s;uch importance, that &s;he procured her friend Mrs. Burnet to con&s;ult Mr. (afterwards Dr.) Clark upon it, and to &s;hew him a paper, which had been put into her hands, urging the difficulties on that article, on the &s;ide of the Papi&s;ts. The &s;entiments of that great man upon this &s;ubject are compri&s;ed in a letter from Mrs. Burnet to Mrs. Trotter, of which our editor has given a co|py, to which we refer the reader in the 31&s;t page of his account.</P>
<P>In 1708 our author was married to Mr. Cock|burn, the &s;on of Dr. Cockburn, an eminent and learned divine of Scotland, at fir&s;t attached to the court of St. Germains, but obliged to quit it on account of his inflexible adherence to the Prote|&s;tant religion; then for &s;ome time mini&s;ter of the Epi&s;copal church at Am&s;terdam, and at la&s;t col|lated to the rectory of Northaw in Middle&s;ex, by Dr. Robin&s;on bi&s;hop of London, at the recommen|dation of Queen Anne. Mr. Cockburn his &s;on, &s;oon after his marriage with our author, had the donative of Nayland in Su&s;&s;ex, where he &s;ettled in the &s;ame year 1708; but returned afterwards from thence to London, to be curate of St. Dun&s;tan's in Fleet-&s;treet, where he continued 'till the acce&s;|&s;ion of his late maje&s;ty to the throne, when fall|ing into a &s;cruple about the oath of abjuration, though he always prayed for the King and Roy|al
<PB N="114" REF="119">
Family by name, he was obliged to quit that &s;tation, and for ten or twelve years following was reduced to great difficulties in the &s;upport of his family; during which time he in&s;tructed the youth of the academy in Chancery-Lane, in the Latin tongue. At la&s;t, in 1726, by con&s;ulting the lord chancellor King and his own father, upon the &s;en&s;e and intent of that oath, and by reading &s;ome papers put into his hands, with relation to it, he was reconciled to the taking of it. In con&s;equence of this, being the year following invited to be mini&s;ter of the Epi&s;copal congregation at Aber|deen in Scotland, he qualified him&s;elf conforma|bly to the law, and, on the day of his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion, preached a &s;ermon there on the duty and benefit of praying for the government. This &s;ermon being printed and animadverted up|on, he publi&s;hed a reply to the remarks on it, with &s;ome papers relating to the oath of abjuration, which have been much e&s;teemed. Soon after his &s;ettlement at Aberdeen, the lord chancellor pre|&s;ented him to the living of Long-Hor&s;ely, near Mor|peth in Northumberland, as a means of enabling him to &s;upport and educate his family; for which purpo&s;e he was allowed to continue his function at Aberdeen, 'till the negligence and ill-behaviour of the curates, whom he employed at Long-Hor&s;e|ly, occa&s;ioned Dr. Chandler, the late bi&s;hop of Durham, to call him to re&s;idence on that living, 1737; by which means he was forced to quit his &s;tation at Aberdeen, to the no &s;mall diminution of his income. He was a man of con&s;iderable learning; and be&s;ides his &s;ermon abovementioned, and the vindication of it, he publi&s;hed, in the Weekly Mi&s;cellany, A Defence of Prime Mini&s;ters, in the Character of Jo&s;eph; and a Treati&s;e of the Mo&s;aic De&s;ign, publi&s;hed &s;ince his death.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cockburn, after her marriage, was entire|ly diverted from her &s;tudies for many years, by at|tending
<PB N="115" REF="120">
upon the duties of a wife and a mother, and by the ordinary cares of an encrea&s;ing fami|ly, and the additional ones ari&s;ing from the reduced circum&s;tances of her hu&s;band. However, her zeal for Mr. Lock's character and writings drew her a|gain into the public light in 1716, upon this occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Dr. Hold&s;worth, fellow of St. John's College in Oxford, had preached on Ea&s;ter-Monday, 1719 20, before that univer&s;ity, a fermon on John v. 20, 29, which he publi&s;hed, profe&s;&s;ing in his title page to examine and an&s;wer the Cavils, Fal&s;e Rea&s;on|ings, and Fal&s;e Interpretations of Scripture, of Mr. Lock and others, again&s;t the Re&s;urrection of the Same Body. This &s;ermon did not reach Mrs. Cockburn's hands 'till &s;ome years after; when the peru&s;al of it forced from her &s;ome animadver&s;i|ons, which &s;he threw together in the form of a letter to the Dr. and &s;ent to him in May 1724, with a de&s;ign of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it entirely, if it &s;hould have the de&s;ired effect upon him. After nine months the Dr. informed her, that he had drawn up a large and particular an&s;wer to it, but was unwilling to tru&s;t her with his manu&s;cript, 'till &s;he &s;hould publi&s;h her own. However, after a long time, and much difficulty, &s;he at la&s;t obtain|ed the peru&s;al of his an&s;wer; but not meeting with that conviction from it, which would have made her give up her cau&s;e, &s;he was prevailed on to let the world judge between them, and ac|cordingly publi&s;hed her Letter to Dr. Hold&s;worth, in January 1726-7, without her name, but &s;aid in the title page to be by the author of, A Defence of Mr. Lock's E&s;&s;ay of Human Under&s;tanding. The Dr. who&s;e an&s;wer to it was already fini&s;hed, was very expeditious in the publication of it in June 1727, in an 8vo volume, under the title of A Defence of the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection of the &s;ame Body, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="121">
Mrs. Cockburn wrote a very particular reply to this, and entitled it, A Vindication of Mr. Lock's Principles, from the injurious Imputations of Dr. Hold&s;worth. But though it is an admira|ble performance, and &s;he was extremely de&s;irous of doing ju&s;tice to Mr. Lock and her&s;elf, yet not meeting with any Book&s;eller willing to undertake, nor her&s;elf being able to &s;upport the expence of the impre&s;&s;ion, it continued in manu&s;cript, and was re&s;erved to enrich the collection publi&s;hed after her death.</P>
<P>Her Remarks upon &s;ome Writers in the Contro|ver&s;y concerning the Foundation of Moral Duty and Moral Obligation were begun during the win|ter of the year 1739, and fini&s;hed in the follow|ing one; for the weakne&s;s of her eyes, which had been a complaint of many years &s;tanding, not permitting her to u&s;e, by candlelight, her needle, which &s;o fully employed her in the &s;ummer &s;ea|&s;on, that &s;he read little, and wrote le&s;s; &s;he a|mu&s;ed her&s;elf, during the long winter-evenings, in dige&s;ting her thoughts upon the mo&s;t ab&s;tract &s;ub|jects in morality and metaphy&s;ics. They continued in manu&s;cript till 1743, for want of a Book&s;eller inclined to accept the publication of them, and were introduced to the world in Augu&s;t that year, in The Hi&s;tory of the Works of the Learned. Her name did not go with them, but they were In&s;cribed with the utmo&s;t Deference to Alexander Pope, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> by an Admirer of his moral Character; for which &s;he &s;hews a remarkable zeal in her let|ters, whenever &s;he has occa&s;ion to mention him. And her high opinion of him in that re&s;pect, founded chiefly on his writings, and e&s;pecially his letters, as well as her admiration of his genius, in&s;pired her with a &s;trong de&s;ire of being known to him; for which purpo&s;e &s;he drew up a pretty long letter to him about the year 1738: but it was never &s;ent. The &s;trength, clearne&s;s, and vi|vacity
<PB N="117" REF="122">
&s;hewn in her Remarks upon the mo&s;t ab|&s;tract and perplexed que&s;tions, immediately rai&s;ed the curio&s;ity of all good judges about the con|cealed writer; and their admiration was greatly increa&s;ed when her &s;ex and advanced age were known. And the worthy Dr. Sharp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of an excellent pamphlet, entitled, Two Di&s;&s;er|tations concerning the Etymology and Scripture-meaning of the Hebrew Words Elohim and Berith.

But her ill &s;tate of health at la&s;t interrupted her pro&s;ecution of it; a circum&s;tance to be regretted, &s;ince a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion carried on with &s;o much &s;agacity and candour on both &s;ides, would, in all probability, have left little difficulty remaining on the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Dr. Rutherforth's E&s;&s;ay on the Nature and Obli|gations of virtue, publi&s;hed in May 1744, &s;oon engaged her thoughts, and notwith&s;tanding the a&s;th|matic di&s;order, which had &s;eized her many years before, and now left her &s;mall intervals of ea&s;e, &s;he applied her&s;elf to the confutation of that ela|borate di&s;cour&s;e; and having fini&s;hed it with a &s;pi|rit, elegance, and per&s;picuity equal, if not &s;uperi|or, to all her former writings, tran&s;mitted her ma|nu&s;cript to Mr. Warburton, who publi&s;hed it in 8vo. with a Preface of his own, in April 1747, under the title of Remarks upon the Principles and Rea&s;onings of Dr. Rutherforth's E&s;&s;ay on the Na|ture and Obligations of Virtue, in Vindication of the contrary Principles and Rea&s;ons inforced in the Writings of the late Dr. Samuel Clark.</P>

And it were to be wi&s;h+ed that tho&s;e two volumes, conditioned for by the terms of &s;ub&s;cription, could have contained all her dramatic writings, of which only one is here pub|li&s;hed. But a that was impo&s;&s;ible, the preference was, upon the mature&s;t deliberation, given to tho&s;e in pro&s;e, as &s;uperior in their kind to the mo&s;t perfect of her poetical, and of more general and la&s;ting u&s;e to the world.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of her hu&s;band on the 4th of January 1748, in the 71&s;t year of his age, was a &s;evere &s;hock to her; and &s;he did not long &s;urvive him, dy|ing on the 11th of May, 1749. in her 71&s;t year, after having long &s;upported a painful di&s;order, with a re&s;ignation to the divine will, which had been the governing principle of her whole life, and her &s;upport under the various trials of it. Her memory and under&s;tanding continued unim|paired, 'till within a few days of her death.

accompli&s;hments. She was indeed &s;mall of &s;tature, but had a remarkable liveline&s;s in her eye, and delicacy of complexion, which continued to her death. Her private character rendered her ex|tremely amiable to tho&s;e who intimately knew her. Her conver&s;ation was always innocent, u&s;e|ful and agreeable, without the lea&s;t affectation of being thought a wit, and attended with a remark|able mode&s;ty and diffidence of her&s;elf, and a con|&s;tant endeavour to adapt her di&s;cour&s;e to her com|pany. She was happy in an uncommon evenne&s;s and chearfulne&s;s of temper. Her di&s;po&s;ition was generous and benevolent; and ready upon all oc|ca&s;ions to forgive injuries, and bear them, as well as mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">fortunes, without interrupting her own ea&s;e, or that of others, with complaints or reproaches. The pre&s;tures of a very contracted fortune were &s;upported by her with calmne&s;s and in &s;ilence; nor did &s;he ever attempt to improve it among tho&s;e great per&s;onages to whom &s;he was known, by importunities; to which the be&s;t minds are mo&s;t aver&s;e, and which her approved merit and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed reputation &s;hould have rendered unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The collection now exhibited to the world is, &s;ays Dr. Birch, and we entirely agree with him, &s;o inconte&s;table a proof of the &s;uperiority of our author's genius, as in a manner &s;uper&s;edes every thing that can be &s;aid upon that head. But her abilities as a writer, and the merit of her works, will not have full ju&s;tice done them, without a due attention to the peculiar circum&s;tances, in which they were produced: her early youth, when &s;he wrote &s;ome, her very advanced age, and ill &s;tate of health, when &s;he drew up others; the unea&s;y &s;ituation of her fortune, during the whole cour&s;e of her life; and an interval of near twenty years in the vigour of it, &s;pent in the cares of a fami|ly, without the lea&s;t lei&s;ure for reading or con|templation: after which, with a mind &s;o long

<HEAD>AMBROSE PHILLIPS, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman was de&s;cended from a very antient, and con&s;iderable family in the county of Leice&s;ter, and received his education in St. John's college Cambridge, where he wrote his Pa&s;torals, a &s;pecies of excellence, in which he is thought to have remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf. When Mr. Philips quitted the univer&s;ity, and repaired to the metropolis, he-became, as Mr. Jacob phra&s;es it, one of the wits at Buttons; and in con&s;equence of this, contracted an acquaintance with tho&s;e bright genius's who frequented it; e&s;pecially Sir Richard Steele, who in the fir&s;t volume of his Tatler in&s;erts a little poem of this author's dated from Copenhagen, which he calls a winter piece; Sir Richard thus mentions it with honour. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This is as fine a piece, as we ever had from any of the &s;chools of the mo&s;t learned painters; &s;uch images as the&s;e give us a new plea&s;ure in our &s;ight, and fix upon our minds traces of reflexion, which accompany us wherever the like objects occur.'</Q></P>
<P>This &s;hort performance which we &s;hall here in&s;ert, was reckoned &s;o elegant, by men of ta&s;te then living, that Mr. Pope him&s;elf, who had a confirmed aver|&s;ion to Philips, when he affected to de&s;pi&s;e his other works, always excepted this out of the number.</P>
<P>It is written from Copenhagen, addre&s;&s;ed to the Earl of Dor&s;et, and dated the 9th of May 1709</P>

<P>But it was not enough for Sir Richard to prai&s;e this performance of Mr. Philips. He was al&s;o an admirer of his Pa&s;torals, which had then obtained a great number of readers: He was about to form
<PB N="125" REF="130">
a Critical Compari&s;on of Pope's Pa&s;torals, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e of Mr. Philips; and giving in the conclu&s;ion, the preference to the latter. Sir Richard's de&s;ign be|ing communicated to Mr. Pope, who was not a little jealous of his reputation, he took the alarm; and by the mo&s;t artful and in&s;inuating method defeated his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The reader cannot be ignorant, that there are &s;everal numbers in the Guardian, employed upon Pa&s;toral Poetry, and one in particular, upon the merits of Philips and Pope, in which the latter is found a better ver&s;i&s;ier; but as a true Arcadian, the preference is given to Philips. That we may be able to convey a perfect idea of the method which Mr. Pope took to prevent the diminution of his reputation, we &s;hall tran&s;cribe the particular parts of that paper in the Guardian, Number XL. Monday April the 27th.</P>
<P>I de&s;igned to have troubled the reader with no farther di&s;cour&s;es of Pa&s;torals, but being informed that I am taxed of partiality, in not mentioning an author, who&s;e Eclogues are publi&s;hed in the &s;ame volume with Mr. Philips's, I &s;hall employ this paper in ob&s;ervations upon him, written in the free &s;pirit of critici&s;m, and without apprehen&s;ions of offending that gentleman, who&s;e character it is, that he takes the greate&s;t care of his works before they are publi&s;ned, and has the lea&s;t concern for them-afterwards. I have laid it down as the fir&s;t rule of Pa&s;toral, that its idea &s;hould be taken from the manners of the Golden Age, and the moral formed upon the repre&s;entation of innocence; 'tis therefore plain, that any deviations from that de&s;ign, degrade a poem from being true Pa&s;toral.</P>
<P>So ea&s;y as Pa&s;toral writing may &s;eem (in the &s;im|plicity we have de&s;cribed it) yet it requires great reading, both of the antients and moderns, to be a ma&s;ter of it. Mr. Philips hath given us mani|fe&s;t proofs of his knowledge of books; it mu&s;t be
<PB N="126" REF="131">
confe&s;&s;ed his competitor has imitated &s;ome &s;ingle thoughts of the antients well enough, if we con|&s;ider he had not the happine&s;s of an univer&s;ity edu|cation: but he hath di&s;per&s;ed them here and there without that order and method Mr. Philips ob|&s;erves, who&s;e whole third pa&s;toral, is an in&s;tance how well he &s;tudied the fifth of Virgil, and how judiciou&s;ly he reduced Virgil's thoughts to the &s;tandard of pa&s;toral; and his contention of Colin Clout, and the Nightingale, &s;hews with what exactne&s;s he hath imitated Strada. When I remarked it as a principal fault to introduce fruits, and flowers of a foreign growth in de&s;criptions, where the &s;cene lies in our country, I did not de|&s;ign that ob&s;ervation &s;hould extend al&s;o to animals, or the &s;en&s;itive life; for Philips hath with great judgment de&s;cribed wolves in England in his fir&s;t pa&s;toral. Nor would I have a poet &s;lavi&s;hly confine him&s;elf, (as Mr. Pope hath done) to one particular &s;ea&s;on of the year, one certain time of the day, and one unbroken &s;cene in each Eclogue. It is plain, Spencer neglected this pedantry, who in his Pa&s;toral of November, mentions the mournful &s;ong of the Nightingale,<Q><L>Sad Philomel, her &s;ong in tears doth &s;teep.</L></Q></P>
<P>And Mr. Philips by a poetical creation, hath rai&s;ed up finer beds of flowers, than the mo&s;t in|du&s;trious gardener; his ro&s;es, lilies, and daffadils, blow in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>But the better to di&s;cover the merit of our two cotemporary pa&s;toral writers. I &s;hall endeavour to draw a parallel of them, by placing &s;everal of their particular thoughts in the &s;ame light; whereby it will be obvious, how much Philips hath the ad|vantage: With what &s;implicity he introduces two &s;hepherds &s;inging alternately.<Q><PB N="127" REF="132">

<P><PB N="130" REF="135">
In another Pa&s;toral, a &s;hepherd utters a Dirge, not much inferior to the former in the following lines.<Q><L>Ah me the while! ah me, the luckle&s;s day!</L>

I defy the mo&s;t common reader to repeat them, without feeling &s;ome motions of com|pa&s;&s;ion. In the next place, I &s;hall rank his Proverbs in which I formerly ob&s;erved he excels: For example,<Q><L>A rolling &s;tone is ever bare of mo&s;s;</L>

<P>Thus far the compari&s;on between the merit of Mr. Pope and Mr. Philips, as writers of Pa&s;toral, made by the author of this paper in the Guardian, after the publication of which, the enemies of Pope exulted, as in one particular &s;pecies of poetry, upon which he valued him&s;elf, he was &s;hewn to be inferior to his contemporary. For &s;ome time they enjoyed their triumph; but it turned out at la&s;t to their un&s;peakable mortification.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="136">
The paper in which the compari&s;on is in&s;erted, was written by Mr. Pope him&s;elf. Nothing could have &s;o effectually defeated the de&s;ign of dimini&s;hing his reputation, as this method, which had a very contrary effect. He laid down &s;ome fal&s;e principles, upon the&s;e he rea&s;oned, and by comparing his own and Philips's Pa&s;torals, upon &s;uch principles it was no great compliment to the latter, that he wrote more agreeable to notions which are in them&s;elves fal&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects of pa&s;toral are as various as the pa&s;&s;ions of human nature; nay, it may in &s;ome mea&s;ure partake of every kind of poetry, but with this limitation, that the &s;cene of it ought always to be laid in the country, and the thoughts never con|trary to the ideas of tho&s;e who are bred there. The images are to be drawn from rural life; and provided the language is per&s;picuous, gentle, and flowing, the &s;entiments may be as elegant as the country &s;cenes can furni&s;h.&mdash;In the particular compari&s;on of pa&s;&s;ages between Pope and Philips, the former is &s;o much &s;uperior, that one cannot help wondering, that Steele could be thus impo&s;ed upon, who was in other re|&s;pects a very quick di&s;cerner. Though 'tis not im|po&s;&s;ible, but that Guardian might go to the pre&s;s without Sir Richard's &s;eeing it; he not being the only per&s;on concern'd in that paper.</P>
<P>The two following lines &s;o much celebrated in this paper, are &s;ufficiently convincing, that the whole critici&s;m is ironical.<Q><L>Ah! &s;illy I, more &s;illy than my &s;heep,</L>
<L>Which on the flowr'y plains I once did keep.</L></Q></P>
<P>Nothing can be much more &s;illy than the&s;e lines; and yet the author &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How he &s;till charms the ear with the artful repetitions of epithets."</Q>

The next work Mr. Philips publi&s;hed after his Pa&s;torals, and which it is &s;aid he wrote at the univer|&s;ity, was his life of John Williams lord keeper of the great-&s;eal, bi&s;hop of Lincoln and archbi&s;hop of York, in the reigns of king James and Charles the Fir&s;t, in which are related &s;ome remarkable occur|rences in tho&s;e times, both in church and &s;tate, with an appendix, giving an account of his benefactions to St. John's college.</P>
<P>Mr. Philips, &s;eems to have made u&s;e of archbi&s;hop William's life, the better to make known his own &s;tate principles, which in the cour&s;e of that work he had a fair occa&s;ion of doing. Bi&s;hop Williams was the great oppo&s;er of High-Church mea&s;ures, he was a perpetual antagoni&s;t to Land; and lord Clarendon mentions him in his hi&s;tory with very great decency and re&s;pect, when it is con&s;idered that they adhered to oppo&s;ite parties.</P>
<P>Mr. Philips, who early di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in revolution principles, was concerned with Dr. Boul|ter, afterwards archbi&s;hop of Armagh, the right honourable Richard We&s;t, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> lord chancellor of Ireland; the revd. Mr. Gilbert Burnet, and the revd. Mr. Henry Stevens, in writing a paper called the Free-Thinker; but they were all publi&s;hed by Mr. Philips, and &s;ince re-printed in three volumes in 12mo. In the latter part of the reign of queen Anne, he was &s;ecretary to the Hanover-Club, a &s;et of noblemen and gentlemen, who a&s;&s;ociated in honour of that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. They drank regular toa&s;ts to the health of tho&s;e ladies, who were mo&s;t zealou&s;ly attached to the Hanoverian family; upon whom Mr. Philips wrote the following lines,<Q><L>While the&s;e, the cho&s;en beauties of our i&s;le,</L>

After the acce&s;&s;ion of his late maje&s;ty, Mr. Phi|lips was made a ju&s;tice of peace, and appointed a commi&s;&s;ioner of the lottery. But though his cir|cum&s;tances were ea&s;y, the &s;tate of his mind was not &s;o; he fell under the &s;evere di&s;plea&s;ure of Mr. Pope, who has &s;atirized him with his u&s;ual keenne&s;s.</P>
<P>'Twas &s;aid, he u&s;ed to mention Mr. Pope as an enemy to the government; and that he was the avowed author of a report, very indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, that he had a hand in a paper called The Examiner. The revenge which Mr. Pope took in con&s;equence of this abu&s;e, greatly reffled the temper of Mr. Philips, who as he was not equal to him in wit, had recour&s;e to another weapon; in the exerci&s;e of which no great parts are requi&s;ite. He hung up a rod at Button's, with which he re&s;olved to cha&s;ti&s;e his antagoni&s;t, whenever he &s;hould come there. But Mr. Pope, who got notice of this de&s;ign, very prudently declined coming to a place, where in all probability he mu&s;t have felt the re&s;entment of an enraged author, as much &s;uperior to him in bodily &s;trength, as inferior in wit and genius.</P>
<P>When Mr. Philips's friend, Dr. Boulter, ro&s;e to be archbi&s;hop of Dublin, he went with him into Ireland, where he had con&s;iderable preferments; and was a member of the Hou&s;e of Commons there, as repre&s;entative of the county of Armagh.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the ridicule which Mr. Philips has drawn upon him&s;elf, by his oppo&s;ition to Pope, and the di&s;advantageous light his Pa&s;torals appear in, when compared with his; yet, there is good rea&s;on to believe, that Mr. Philips was no mean Arcadian: By endeavouring to imitate too &s;ervilely the manners and &s;entiments of vulgar ru&s;tics, he has &s;ometimes rai&s;ed a laugh again&s;t him; yet there are in &s;ome of his Pa&s;torals a natural &s;implicity, a true Doric dialect, and very graphical de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>Mr. Gildon, in his compleat Art of Poetry, men|tions him with Theocritus and Virgil; but then

<P>We &s;hall now con&s;ider Mr. Philips as a dramatic writer. The fir&s;t piece he brought upon the &s;tage, was his Di&s;tre&s;s'd Mother, tran&s;lated from the French of Mon&s;ieur Racine, but not without &s;uch devia|tions as Mr. Philips thought nece&s;&s;ary to heighten the di&s;tre&s;s; for writing to the heart is a &s;ecret which the be&s;t of the French poets have not found out. This play was acted fir&s;t in the year 1711, with every advantage a play could have. Pyrrhus was performed by Mr. Booth, a part in which he acquired great reputation. Ore&s;tes was given to Mr. Powel, and Andromache was excellently per|&s;onated by the inimitable Mrs. Oldfield. Nor was Mrs. Porter beheld in Hermione without admiration. The Di&s;tre&s;s'd Mother is &s;o often acted, and &s;o frequently read, we &s;hall not trouble the reader with giving any farther account of it.</P>
<P>A modern critic &s;peaking of this play, ob&s;erves that the di&s;tre&s;s of Andromache moves an audi|ence more than that of Belvidera, who is as ami|able a wife, as Andromache is an affectionate mo|ther; their circum&s;tances though not &s;imilar, are equally intere&s;ting, and yet &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the female part of the audience is more di&s;po&s;ed to weep for the &s;uffering mother, than the &s;uffering wife<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide the ACTOR.</NOTE>.'</Q> The rea&s;on 'tis imagin'd is this, there are more affectionate mothers in the world than wives.</P>

but they are admirably fitted to rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion peculiar to tragedy. Vanoc Prince of the Corna|vians married for his &s;econd wife Carti&s;mand, Queen of the Brigantians, a woman of an impe|rious &s;pirit, who proved a &s;evere &s;tep-mother to the King's daughter Gwendolen, betrothed to Yvor, the Prince of the Silurians. The mutual di&s;agreement between Vanoc and his Queen, at la&s;t produced her revolt from him. She intrigues with Vellocad, who had been formerly the King's &s;ervant, and enters into a league with the Roman tribune, in order to be revenged on her hu&s;band. Vanoc fights &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful battles, but his af|fairs are thrown into the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, upon receiving the news that a party of the enemy has carried off the Prince&s;s his daughter. She is con|ducted to the tent of Valens the Roman tribune, who was him&s;elf in love with her, but who of|fered her no violation. He went to Vanoc in the name of Didius the Roman general, to offer terms of peace, but he was rejected with indignation. The &s;cene between Vanoc and Valens is one of the mo&s;t ma&s;terly to be met with in tragedy. Va|lens returns to his fair charge, while her father prepares for battle, and to re&s;cue his daughter by the force of arms. But Carti&s;mand, who knew that no mercy would be &s;hewn her at the hands of her &s;tern hu&s;band, flies to the Prince&s;s's tent, and in the violence of her rage &s;tabs her. The King and Yvor enter that in&s;tant, but too late to &s;ave the beauteous Gwendolen from the blow, who expires in the arms of her betrothed hu&s;band, a &s;cene wrought up with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s.

<P>The next year Mr. Philips introduced another tragedy on the &s;tage called Humfrey Duke of Glouce&s;ter, acted 1721. The plot of this play is founded on hi&s;tory. During the minority of Hen|ry VI. his uncle, the duke of Glouce&s;ter, was rai&s;ed to the dignity of Regent of the Realm. This high &s;tation could not but procure him ma|ny enemies, among&s;t whom was the duke of Suf|folk, who, in order to re&s;train his power, and to in&s;pire the mind of young Henry with a love of independence, effected a marriage between that Prince, and Margaret of Anjou, a Lady of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate beauty, and what is very rare among&s;t her &s;ex, of the mo&s;t approved courage. This la|dy entertained an aver&s;ion for the duke of Glou|ce&s;ter, becau&s;e he oppo&s;ed her marriage with the King, and accordingly re&s;olves upon his ruin.</P>
<P>She draws over to her party cardinal Beaufort, the Regent's uncle, a &s;upercilious proud church|man. They fell upon a very odd &s;cheme to &s;hake the power of Glouce&s;ter, and as it is very &s;ingu|lar, and ab&s;olutely fact, we &s;hall here in&s;ert it.</P>
<P>The duke of Glouce&s;ter had kept Eleanor Cobham, daughter to the lord Cobham, as his con|cubine, and after the di&s;&s;olution of his marriage with the counte&s;s of Hainault, he made her his wife; but this did not re&s;tore her reputation: &s;he was, however, too young to pa&s;s in common re|pute for a witch, yet was arre&s;ted for high trea|&s;on, founded on a pretended piece of witchcraft, and after doing public penance &s;everal days, by &s;entence of convocation, was condemned to per|petual impri&s;onment in the I&s;le of Man, but af|terwards removed to Killingworth-ca&s;tle. The fact charged upon her, was the making an image of wax re&s;embling the King, and treated in &s;uch a manner by incantations, and &s;orceries, as to make
<PB N="138" REF="143">
him wa&s;te away, as the image gradually con&s;um|ed. John Hume, her chaplain, Thomas South|well, a canon of St. Stephen's We&s;tmin&s;ter, Ro|ger Bolingbroke, a clergyman highly e&s;teemed, and eminent for his uncommon learning, and me|rit, and perhaps on that account, reputed to have great &s;kill in necromancy, and Margery Jourde|main, commonly called The Witch of Eye, were tried as her accomplices, and condemned, the wo|man to be burnt, the others to be drawn, hanged, and quartered at Tyburn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Cart's Hi&s;tory of England, Reign of Henry VI.</NOTE>. This helli&s;h contri|vance again&s;t the wife of the duke of Glouce&s;ter, was meant to &s;hake the influence of her hu&s;band, which in reality it did, as ignorance and creduli|ty co-operated with his enemies to de&s;troy him. He was arre&s;ted for high trea&s;on, a charge which could not be &s;upported, and that his enemies might have no further trouble with him, cardinal Beau|fort hired a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to murder him. The poet ac|knowledges the hints he has taken from the Se|cond Part of Shake&s;pear's Henry VI. and in &s;ome &s;cenes has copied &s;everal lines from him. In the la&s;t &s;cene, that pathetic &s;peech of Eleanor's to Car|dinal Beaufort when he was dying in the ago|nies of remor&s;e and de&s;pair, is literally borrowed.<Q><SP>

<HEAD>RICHARD MAITLAND, Earl of LAUDERDALE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS learned nobleman was nephew to John, the great duke of Lauderdale, who was &s;ecretary of &s;tate to King Charles II. for Scotch affairs, and for many years had the go|vernment of that kingdom entirely entru&s;ted to him. Whoever is acquainted with hi&s;tory will be at no lo&s;s to know, with how little modera|tion he exerci&s;ed his power; he ruled his native country with a rod of iron, and was the author of all tho&s;e di&s;turbances and per&s;ecutions which have &s;tained the Annals of Scotland, during that inglorious period.</P>
<P>As the duke of Lauderdale was without i&s;&s;ue|male of his own body, he took our author into his protection as his immediate heir, and ordered him to be educated in &s;uch a manner as to qua|lify him for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e great employ|ments his ance&s;tors enjoyed in the &s;tate. The im|provement of this young nobleman &s;o far exceeded his years, that he was very early admitted into the privy council, and made lord ju&s;tice clerk; anno 1681. He married the daughter of the earl of Argyle, who was tried for &s;edition in the &s;tate, and confined in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh. When Argyle found his fate approaching, he meditated, and effected his e&s;cape; and &s;ome letters of his
<PB N="144" REF="149">
being intercepted and decyphered, which had been written to the earl of Lauderdale, his lord&s;hip fell under a cloud, and was &s;tript of his preferments. The&s;e letters were only of a familiar nature, and contained nothing but dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s; but a corre&s;pondence with a per&s;on condemned, was e&s;teemed a &s;in in politics not to be forgiven, e&s;pe|cially by a man of the Duke of York's furious di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Though the duke of Lauderdale had ordered our author to be educated as his heir, yet he left all his per&s;onal e&s;tate, which was very great, to another, the young nobleman having, by &s;ome means, di&s;obliged him; and as he was of an un|governable implacable temper, could never again recover his favour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Crawford's Peerage of Scotland.</NOTE>. Though the earl of Lauder|dale was thus removed from his pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es by the court, yet he per&s;i&s;ted in his loyalty to the Royal Family, and, upon the revolution, followed the for|tune of King James II. and &s;ome years after died in France, leaving no &s;urviving i&s;&s;ue, &s;o that the titles devolved on his younger brother.</P>
<P>While the earl was in exile with his Royal ma|&s;ter, he applied his mind to the delights of poe|try, and, in his lei&s;ure hours, compleated a tran|&s;lation of Virgil's works. Mr. Dryden, in his de|dication of the Aeneis, thus mentions it; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The late earl of Lauderdale, &s;ays he, &s;ent me over his new tran&s;lation of the Aeneis, which he had ended before I engaged in the &s;ame de&s;ign. Nei|ther did I then intend it, but &s;ome propo&s;als be|ing afterwards made me by my Book&s;eller, I de&s;ired his lord&s;hip's leave that I might accept them, which he freely granted, and I have his letter to &s;hew for that permi&s;&s;ion. He re&s;olved to have printed his work, which he might have done two years before I could have publi&s;hed
<PB N="145" REF="150">
mine; and had performed it, if death had not prevented him. But having his manu&s;cript in my hands, I con&s;ulted it as often as I doubted of my author's &s;en&s;e; for no man under&s;tood Virgil better than that learned nobleman. His friends have yet another, and more correct copy of that tran&s;lation by them, which if they had plea&s;ed to have given the public, the judges might have been convinced that I have not flat|tered him.'</Q></P>
<P>Lord Lauderdale's friends, &s;ome years after the publication of Dryden's Tran&s;lation, permitted his lord&s;hip's to be printed, and, in the late editions of that performance, tho&s;e lines are marked with inverted commas, which Dryden thought proper to adopt into his ver&s;ion, which are not many; and however clo&s;ely his lord&s;hip may have rendered Virgil, no man can conceive a high opinion of that poet, contemplated through the medium of his Tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>Dr. Trapp, in his preface to the Aeneis, ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that his lord&s;hip's Tran&s;lation is pretty near to the original, though not &s;o clo&s;e as its brevity would make one imagine; and it &s;ufficiently ap|pears, that he had a right ta&s;te in poetry in ge|neral, and the Aeneid in particular. He &s;hews a true &s;pirit, and, in many places, is very beau|tiful. But we &s;hould certainly have &s;een Virgil far better tran&s;lated, by a noble hand, had the earl of Lauderdale been the earl of Ro&s;common, and had the Scotti&s;h peer followed all the pre|cepts, and been animated with the genius of the Iri&s;h.'</Q></P>
<P>We know of no other poetical compo&s;itions of this learned nobleman, and the idea we have received from hi&s;tory of his character, is, that he was in every re&s;pect the rever&s;e of his uncle,
<PB N="146" REF="151">
from whence we may rea&s;onably conclude, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many virtues, &s;ince few &s;tate&s;men of any age ever were tainted with more vices than the duke of Lauderdale.</P>

<HEAD>Dr. JOSEPH TRAPP.</HEAD>
<P>THIS poet was &s;econd &s;on to the rev. Mr. Jo&s;eph Trapp, rector of Cherington in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, at which place he was born, anno 1679. He received the fir&s;t rudiments of learn|ing from his father, who in&s;tructed him in the lan|guages, and &s;uperintended his dome&s;tic education<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Jacob.</NOTE>. When he was ready for the univer&s;ity he was &s;ent to Oxford, and was many years &s;cholar and fellow of Wadham-College, where he took the degree of ma&s;ter of arts. In the year 1708 he was una|nimou&s;ly cho&s;en profe&s;&s;or of poetry, being the fir&s;t of that kind. This in&s;titution was founded by Dr. Henry Birkhead, formerly fellow of All-Souls, and the place of lecturer can be held only for ten years.</P>
<P>Dr. Trapp was, in the early part of his life, chaplain to lord Bolingbroke, the father of the fa|mous Bolingbroke, lately decea&s;ed. The highe&s;t preferment Dr. Trapp ever had in the church, though he was a man of exten&s;ive learning, was, the rectory of Harlington, Middle&s;ex, and of the united pari&s;hes of Chri&s;t-Church, Newgate-Street,
<PB N="147" REF="152">
and St. Leonard's Fo&s;ter-Lane, with the lec|ture&s;hip of St. Lawrence Jewry, and St. Martin's in the Fields. The Dr's principles were not of that ca&s;t, by which promotion could be expected. He was attached to the High-Church intere&s;t, and as his temper was not &s;ufficiently pliant to yield to the prevalence of party, perhaps for that very rea&s;on, his ri&s;ing in the church was retarded. A gentleman of learning and genius, when paying a vi&s;it to the Dr. took occa&s;ion to lament, as there had been lately &s;ome con&s;iderable alterations made, and men le&s;s qualified than he, rai&s;ed to the mi|tre, that di&s;tinctions &s;hould be conferred with &s;o little regard to merit, and wondered that he (the Dr.) had never been promoted to a &s;ee. To this the Dr. replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am thought to have &s;ome learning, and &s;ome hone&s;ty, and the&s;e are but indifferent qua|lifications to enable a man to ri&s;e in the church.'</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Trapp's action in the pulpit has been cen|&s;ured by many, as participating too much of the theatrical manner, and having more the air of an itinerant enthu&s;ia&s;t, than a grave eccle&s;ia&s;tic. Per|haps it may be true, that his pulpit ge&s;ticulations were too violent, yet they bore &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of &s;incerity, and the &s;ide on which he erred, was the mo&s;t favourable to the audience; as the ex|treme of over-acting any part, is not half &s;o into|lerable as a languid indifference, whether what the preacher is then uttering, is true or fal&s;e, is worth attention or no. The Dr. being once in company with a per&s;on, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion was that of a player, took occa&s;ion to a&s;k him, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'what was the rea&s;on that an actor &s;eemed to feel his part with &s;o much &s;incerity, and utter it with &s;o much empha&s;is and &s;pirit, while a preacher, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion is of a higher nature,

Though this &s;eems to be the advantage of blank ver&s;e over rhime, yet we cannot entirely condemn the u&s;e of it, even in a heroic poem; nor ab&s;olutely reject that in &s;peculation, which. Mr.

<P>Dr. Trapp towards the conclu&s;ion of his Preface to the Aeneid, has treated Dryden with le&s;s reve|rence, than might have been expected from a man of his under&s;tanding, when &s;peaking of &s;o great a genius.

There are few better critici&s;ms in any language, Dryden's dedications and prefaces excepted, than are contained in the&s;e lectures.

Our author's father was a per&s;on &s;o much re&s;pected by tho&s;e immediately under his mini&s;terial care, and whoever el&s;e had the hap|pine&s;s of his acquaintance, that people of all de|nominations united in e&s;teeming him, not only for his learning and abilities, but his exten&s;ive humanity and undi&s;&s;embled piety.</P>
<P>This Revd. Gentleman had &s;o much dignity in his manner, that he obtained from the common people the name of bi&s;hop Boy&s;e, meant as a com|pliment to the gracefulne&s;s of his per&s;on and mien. But though Mr. Boy&s;e was thus reverenced by the multitude, and courted by people of fa&s;hion, be never contracted the lea&s;t air of &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s: He was humane and affable in his temper, equally re|moved from the &s;tiffne&s;s of pedantry, and offen&s;ive levity. During his mini&s;terial charge at Dublin, he publi&s;hed many &s;ermons, which compo&s;e &s;everal folio volumes, a few Poems and other Tracts; but what chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed him as a writer, was the controver&s;y he carried on with Dr. King, arch|bi&s;hop of Dublin, and author of the Origin of Evil, concerning the office of a &s;criptural bi&s;hop. This controverted point was managed on both &s;ides with great force of argument, and calmne&s;s of temper. The bi&s;hop a&s;&s;erted that the epi&s;copal right of juri&s;|diction had its foundation in the New-Te&s;tament: Mr. Boy&s;e, con&s;i&s;tent with his principles, denied that
<PB N="161" REF="166">
any eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperiority appeared there; and in the opinion of many, Mr. Boy&s;e was more than equal to his antagoni&s;t, whom he treated in the cour&s;e of the controver&s;y, with the greate&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> and good manners.</P>
<P>It has been reported that Mr. Boy&s;e had two bro|thers, one a clergyman of the church of England, and the other a cardinal at Rome; but of this cir|cum&s;tance we have no ab&s;olute certainty: Be it as it may, he had, however, no brother &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed in the world as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now enter upon the life of our poet, who will appear while we trace it, to have been in every re&s;pect the rever&s;e of his father, genius ex|cepted.&mdash;</P>
<P>He was born in the year 1708, and received the rudiments of his education in a private &s;chool in Dublin. When he was but eighteen years old, his father, who probably intended him for the mini&s;try, &s;ent him to the univer&s;ity of Gla&s;gow, that he might fini&s;h his education there. He had not been a year at the univer&s;ity, till be fell in love with one Mi&s;s Atchen&s;on, the daughter of a trade&s;|man in that city, and was imprudent enough to in|terrupt his education, by marrying her, before he had entered into his 20th year.</P>
<P>The natural extravagance of his temper &s;oon ex|po&s;ed him to want, and as he had now the addi|tional charge of a wife, his reduced circum&s;tances obliged him to quit the univer&s;ity, and go over with his wife (who al&s;o carried a &s;i&s;ter with her) to Dublin; where they relied upon the old gen|tleman for &s;upport. His behaviour in this de|pendent &s;tate, was the very rever&s;e of what it &s;hould have been. In place of directing his &s;tudies to &s;ome u&s;eful acqui&s;ition, &s;o as to &s;upport him&s;elf and family, he &s;pent his time in the mo&s;t abject trifling, and drew many heavy expences up|on his father, who had no other means of &s;upport|ing him&s;elf than what his congregation afforded, and a
<PB N="162" REF="167">
&s;mall e&s;tate of four&s;core pounds a year in York|&s;hire.</P>
<P>Con&s;iderations of prudence never entered into the heart of this unhappy young man, who ran from one exce&s;s to another, till an indulgent parent was reduced by his means to very great em|barra&s;&s;ments. Young Boy&s;e was of all men the far|the&s;t removed from a gentleman; he had no graces of per&s;on, and fewer &s;till of conver&s;ation. To this cau&s;e it was perhaps owing, that his wife, naturally of a very volatile &s;prightly temper, either grew tired of him, or became enamour'd of variety. It was however abundantly certain, that &s;he pur&s;ued in|trigues with other men; and what is &s;till more &s;ur|pri&s;ing, not without the knowledge of her hu&s;band, who had either too abject a &s;pirit to re&s;ent it; or was bribed by &s;ome lucrative advantage, to which he had a mind mean enough to &s;toop. Though never were three people of more libertine characters than young Boy&s;e, his wife, and &s;i&s;ter-in-law; yet the two ladies wore &s;uch a ma&s;k of decency before the old gen|tleman, that his fondne&s;s was never abated. He hoped that time and experience would recover his &s;on from his cour&s;es of extravagance; and as he was of an un&s;u&s;pecting temper, he had not the lea&s;t jea'ou&s;y of the real conduct of his daughter-in-law, who grew every day in his favour, and continued to blind him, by the &s;eeming decency of her behaviour, and a performance of tho&s;e acts of piety, he na|turally expected from her. But the old gentleman was deceived in his hopes, for time made no altera|tion in his &s;on. The e&s;tate his father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in York&s;hire was &s;old to di&s;charge his debts; and when the old man lay in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, he was entirely &s;upported by pre&s;ents from his congrega|tion, and buried at their expence.</P>
<P>We have no farther account of Mr. Boy&s;e, till we find him &s;oon after his father's death at Edinburgh; but from what motives he went there we cannot now
<PB N="163" REF="168">
di&s;cover. At this place his poetical genius rai&s;ed him many friends, and &s;ome patrons of very great eminence. He publi&s;hed a volume of poems in 1731, to which is &s;ubjoined The Taolature of Cebes, and a Letter upon Liberty, in&s;erted in the Dublin Journal 1726; and by the&s;e he obtained a very great reputation. They are addre&s;&s;ed to the counte&s;s of Eglington, a lady of di&s;tingui&s;hed excellencies, and &s;o much celebrated for her beauty, that it would be difficult for the be&s;t pane|gyri&s;t to be too lavi&s;h in her prai&s;e. This amiable lady was patrone&s;s of all men of wit, and very much di&s;tingui&s;hed Mr. Boy&s;e, while he re&s;ided in that country. She was not however exempt from the lot of humanity, and her con&s;picuous accom|pli&s;hments were yet chequered with failings: The chief of which was too high a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own charms, which in&s;pired a vanity that &s;ometimes betrayed her into errors.</P>
<P>The following &s;hort anecdote was frequently re|lated by Mr. Boy&s;e. The counte&s;s one day came in|to the bed-chamber of her younge&s;t daughter, then about 13 years old, while &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing at her toilet. The counte&s;s ob&s;erving the a&s;&s;iduity with which the young lady wanted to &s;et off her per&s;on to the be&s;t advantage, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'a&s;ked her, what &s;he would give to be as hand&s;ome as her mamma?'</Q> To which Mi&s;s replied; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'As much as your lady&s;hip would give to be as young as me.'</Q> This &s;mart repartee which was at once pungent and witty, very &s;en|&s;ibly affected the counte&s;s; who for the future was le&s;s lavi&s;h in prai&s;e of her own charms.&mdash;</P>
<P>Upon the death of the vi&s;counte&s;s Stormont. Mr. Boy&s;e wrote an Elegy, which was very much ap|plauded by her lady&s;hip's relations. This Elegy he intitled, The Tears of the Mu&s;es, as the decea&s;ed lady was a woman of the mo&s;t refined ta&s;te in the &s;ciences, and a great admirer of poetry. The lord
<PB N="164" REF="169">
Stormont was &s;o much plea&s;ed with this mark of e&s;teem paid to the memory of his lady, that he or|dered a very hand&s;ome pre&s;ent to be given to Mr. Boy&s;e, by his attorney at Edinburgh.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Boy&s;e's name was very well known in that city, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">et his per&s;on was ob&s;cure; for as he was altogether un&s;ocial in his temper, he had but few ac|quaintances, and tho&s;e of a ca&s;t much inferior to him&s;elf, and with whom he ought to have been a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ociate. It was &s;ome time before he could be found out; and lord Stormont's kind inten|tions had been defeated, if an adverti&s;ement had not been publi&s;hed in one of their weekly papers, de&s;iring the author of the Tears of the Mu&s;es to call at the hou&s;e of the attorney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Profe&s;&s;ion, which in that City is denominated a Writer.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The per&s;onal ob&s;curity of Mr. Boy&s;e might per|haps not be altogether owing to his habits of gloomine&s;s and retirement. Nothing is more diffi|cult in that city, than to make acquaintances; There are no places where people meet and con|ver&s;e promi&s;cuou&s;ly: There is a re&s;ervedne&s;s and gravity in the manner of the inhabitants, which makes a &s;tranger aver&s;e to approach them. They naturally love &s;olitude; and are very &s;low in con|tracting friend&s;hips. They are generous; but it is with a bad grace. They are &s;trangers to affability, and they maintain a haughtine&s;s and an apparent indifference, which deters a man from courting them. They may be &s;aid to be ho&s;pitable, but not complai&s;ant to &s;trangers: In&s;incerity and cruelty have no exi&s;tence among&s;t them; but if they ought not to be hated, they can never be much loved, for they are incapable of in&s;inuation, and their igno|rance of the world makes them unfit for entertain|ing &s;en&s;ible &s;trangers. They are public-&s;pirited, but torn to pieces by factions. A gloomine&s;s in re|ligion
<PB N="165" REF="170">
renders one part of them very barbarous, and an enthu&s;ia&s;m in politics &s;o tran&s;ports the gen|teeler part, that they &s;acrifice to party almo&s;t every con&s;ideration of tenderne&s;s. Among &s;uch a people, a man may long live, little known, and le&s;s in&s;tructed; for their re&s;ervedne&s;s renders them un|communicative, and their exce&s;&s;ive haughtine&s;s pre|vents them from being &s;olicitous of knowledge.</P>
<P>The Scots are far from being a dull nation; they are lovers of pomp and &s;hew; but then there is an eternal &s;tiffne&s;s, a kind of affected dignity, which &s;poils their plea&s;ures. Hence we have the le&s;s rea|&s;on to wonder that Boy&s;e lived ob&s;curely at Edin|burgh. His extreme carele&s;ne&s;s about his dre&s;s was a circum&s;tance very inau&s;picious to a man who lives in that city. They are &s;uch lovers of this kind of de|corum, that they will admit of no infringement upon it; and were a man with more wit than Pope, and more philo&s;ophy than Newton, to appear at their mar|ket place negligent in his apparel, he would be avoid|ed by his acquaintances who would rather ri&s;k his di&s;plea&s;ure, than the cen&s;ure of the public, which would not fail to &s;tigmatize them, for a&s;&s;ociating with a man &s;eemingly poor; for they mea&s;ure po|verty, and riches, under&s;tanding, or its oppo&s;ite, by exterior appearance. They have many virtues, but their not being poli&s;hed prevents them from &s;hining.</P>
<P>The notice which lady Eglington and the lord Stormont took of our poet, recommended him like|wi&s;e to the patronage of the dutche&s;s of Gordon, who was a lady not only di&s;tingui&s;hed for her ta&s;te; but cultivated a corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent poets then living. The dutche&s;s was &s;o zealous in Mr. Boy&s;e's affairs, and &s;o &s;olicitous to rai&s;e him above nece&s;&s;ity, that &s;he employed her intere&s;t in procuring the promi&s;e of a place for him. She gave him a letter, which he was next day to deliver to one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms
<PB N="166" REF="171">
at Edinburgh. It happened that he was then &s;ome miles di&s;tant from the city, and the morning on which he was to have rode to town with her grace's letter of recommendation proved to be rainy. This &s;lender circum&s;tance was enough to di&s;courage Boy&s;e, who never looked beyond the pre&s;ent moment: He declined going to town on account of the rainy weather, and while he let &s;lip the opportunity, the place was be&s;towed upon another, which the commi&s;&s;ioner declared he kept for &s;ome time vacant, in expectation of &s;eeing a per|&s;on recommended by the dutche&s;s of Gordon.</P>
<P>Of a man of this indolence o&s; temper, this &s;luggi&s;h meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, the reader cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed to find the &s;uture conduct con&s;i&s;t of a con|tinued &s;erious of blunders, for he who had not &s;pi|rit to pro&s;ecute an advantage put in his hands, will neither bear di&s;tre&s;s with fortitude, nor &s;truggle to &s;urmount it with re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Boy&s;e at la&s;t, having defeated all the kind inten|tions of his patrons towards him, fell into a con|tempt and poverty, which obliged him to quit Edinburgh, as his creditors began to &s;ollicit the payment of their debts, with an earne&s;tne&s;s not to be trifled with. He communicated his de&s;ign of going to London to the dutche&s;s of Gordon; who having &s;till a very high opinion of his poetical abilities, gave him a letter of recommendation to Mr. Pope, and obtained another for him to Sir Peter King, the lord chancellor of England. Lord Stormont re|commended him to the &s;ollicitor-general his bro|ther, and many other per&s;ons of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Upon receiving the&s;e letters, he, with great caution, quitted Edinburgh, regretted by none but his creditors, who were &s;o exa&s;perated as to threat|en to pro&s;ecute him wherever he &s;hould be found. But the&s;e menaces were never carried into execu|tion, perhaps from the con&s;ideration of his indi|gence,
<PB N="167" REF="172">
which afforded no probable pro&s;pect of their being paid.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival in London, he went to Twick|enham, in order to deliver the dutche&s;s of Gordon's letter to Mr. Pope; but that gentleman not being at home, Mr. Boy&s;e never gave him&s;elf the trouble to repeat his vi&s;it, nor in all probability would Pope have been over-fond of him; as there was nothing in his conver&s;ation which any wi&s;e indicated the abilities he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He frequent|ly related, that he was graciou&s;ly received by Sir Peter King, dined at his table, and partook of his plea&s;ures. But this relation, they who knew Mr. Boy&s;e well, never could believe; for he was &s;o abject in his di&s;po&s;ition, that he never could look any man in the face who&s;e appearance was better than his own; nor likely had courage to &s;it at Sir Peter King's table, where every one was probably his &s;uperior. He had no power of maintaining the dignity of wit, and though his under&s;tanding was very exten&s;ive, yet but a few could di&s;cover that he had any genius above the common rank. This want of &s;pirit produced the greate&s;t part of his calamities, becau&s;e he knew not how to avoid them by any vigorous effort of his mind. He wrote poems, but tho&s;e, though excellent in their kind, were lo&s;t to the world, by being introduced with no advantage. He had &s;o &s;trong a propen&s;ion to groveling, that his acquaintance were generally of &s;uch a ca&s;t, as could be of no &s;ervice to him; and tho&s;e in higher life he addre&s;&s;ed by letters, not having &s;ufficient confidence or politene&s;s to conver&s;e familiarly with them; a freedom to which he was intitled by the power of his genius. Thus unfit to &s;upport him&s;elf in the world, he was expo&s;ed to variety of di&s;tre&s;s, from which he could invent no means of extricating him|&s;elf, but by writing mendicant letters. It will ap|pear amazing, but impartiality obliges us to relate it, that this man, of &s;o abject a &s;pirit, was voluptu|ous
<PB N="168" REF="173">
and luxurious: He had no ta&s;te for any thing elegant, and yet was to the la&s;t degree expen&s;ive. Can it be believed, that often when he had received half a guinea, in con&s;equence of a &s;upplicating let|ter, he would go into a tavern, order a &s;upper to be prepared, drink of the riche&s;t wines, and &s;pend all the money that had ju&s;t been given him in charity, without having any one to participate the regale with him, and while his wife and child were &s;tarving home? This is an in&s;tance of ba&s;e &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, for which no name is as yet invented, and except by another poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Savage.</NOTE>, with &s;ome variation of circum|&s;tances, was perhaps never practi&s;ed by the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual epicure.</P>
<P>He had yet &s;ome friends, many of the mo&s;t emi|nent di&s;&s;enters, who from a regard to the memory of his father, afforded him &s;upplies from time to time. Mr. Boy&s;e by perpetual applications, at la&s;t exhau&s;ted their patience; and they were obliged to abandon a man on whom their liberality was ill be&s;towed, as it produced no other advantage to him, than a few days &s;upport, when he returned again with the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>The epithet of cold has often been given to cha|rity, perhaps with a great deal of truth; but if any thing can warrant us to withhold our charity, it is the con&s;ideration that its purpo&s;es are pro&s;ti|tuted by tho&s;e on whom it is be&s;towed.</P>
<P>We have already taken notice of the infidelity of his wife; and now her circum&s;tances were re|duced, her virtue did not improve. She fell into a way of life di&s;graceful to the &s;ex; nor was his beha|viour in any degree more moral. They were fre|quently covered with ignominy, reproaching one another for the acqui&s;ition of a di&s;ea&s;e, which both de&s;erved, becau&s;e mutually guilty.</P>
<P>It was about the year 1740, that Mr. Boy&s;e re|duced to the la&s;t extremity of human wretchedne&s;s,
<PB N="169" REF="174">
had not a &s;hirt, a coat, or any kind of apparel to put on; the &s;heets in which he lay were carried to the pawnbroker's, and he was obliged to be confined to bed, with no other covering than a blanket. He had little &s;upport but what he got by writing letters to his friends in the mo&s;t abject &s;tile. He was per|haps a&s;hamed to let this in&s;tance of di&s;tre&s;s be known to his friends, which might be the occa&s;ion of his remaining &s;ix weeks in that &s;ituation. During this time he had &s;ome employment in writing ver&s;es for the Magazines; and whoever had &s;een him in his &s;tudy, mu&s;t have thought the object &s;ingular enough. He &s;at up in bed with the blanket wrapt about him, through which he had cut a hole large enough to admit his arm, and placing the paper upon his knee, &s;cribbled in the be&s;t manner he could the ver&s;es he was obliged to make: Whatever he got by tho&s;e, or any of his begging letters, was but ju&s;t &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ervation of life. And perhaps he would have remained much longer in this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate, had not a compa&s;&s;ionate gentleman, upon hearing this circum&s;tance related, ordered his cloaths to be taken out of pawn, and enabled him to appear again abroad.</P>
<P>This &s;ix weeks penance one would imagine &s;uffi|cient to deter him for the future, from &s;uffering him&s;elf to be expo&s;ed to &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es; but by a long habit of want it grew familiar to him, and as he had le&s;s delicacy than other men, he was per|haps le&s;s afflicted with his exterior meanne&s;s. For the future, whenever his di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;o pre&s;s'd, as to induce him to di&s;po&s;e of his &s;hirt, he fell upon an artificial method of &s;upplying one. He cut &s;ome white paper in &s;lips, which he tyed round his wri&s;ts, and in the &s;ame manner &s;upplied his neck. In this plight he frequently appeared abroad, with the ad|ditional inconvenience of want of breeches.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="175">
He was once &s;ent for in a hurry, to the hou&s;e of a printer who had employed him to write a poem for his Magazine: Boy&s;e then was without breeches, or wai&s;tcoat, but was yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a coat, which he threw upon him, and in this ridiculous manner went to the printer's hou&s;e; where he found &s;everal women, whom his extraordinary ap|pearance obliged immediately to retire.</P>
<P>He fell upon many &s;trange &s;chemes of rai&s;ing t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ting &s;ums: He &s;ometimes ordered his wife to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">form people that he was ju&s;t expiring, and by this artifice work upon their compa&s;&s;ion; and many of his friends were frequently &s;urpri&s;ed to meet the man in the &s;treet to day, to whom they had ye&s;ter|day &s;ent: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lief, as to a per&s;on on the verge of death. At other times he would propo&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions for poems, of which only the beginning and conclu&s;ion were written; and by this expedient would relieve &s;ome pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity. But as he &s;eldom was able to put any of his poems to the pre&s;s, his veracity in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s particular &s;uffered a diminution; and indeed in almo&s;t every other particular he might ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected; for if he could but gratify an imme|diate appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ite, he cared not at what expence, whe|ther of the reputation, or pur&s;e of another.</P>
<P>About the year 1745 Mr. Boy&s;e's wife died. He was then at Reading, and pretended much con|cern when he heard of her death.</P>
<P>It was an affectation in Mr. Boy&s;e to appear very fond of a little lap-dog which he always carried about with him in his arms, imagining it gave him the air of a man of ta&s;te. Boy&s;e, who&s;e circum|&s;tances were then too mean to put him&s;elf in mourn|ing, was yet re&s;olved that &s;ome part of his family &s;hould. He &s;tep'd into a little &s;hop; purcha&s;ed half a yard of black ribbon, which he fixed round his dog's neck by way of mourning for the lo&s;s of its mi&s;tre&s;s. But this was not the only ridiculous in|&s;tance
<PB N="171" REF="176">
of his behaviour on the death of his wife. Such was the &s;otti&s;hne&s;s of this man, that when he was in liquor, he always indulged a dream of his wife's being &s;till alive, and would talk very &s;pight|fully of tho&s;e by whom he &s;u&s;pected &s;he was enter|tained. This he never mentioned however, except in his cups, which was only as often as he had money to &s;pend. The manner of his becoming intoxicated was very particular. As he had no &s;pirit to keep g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">od company, &s;o he retired to &s;ome ob&s;cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e ale|hou&s;e, and regaled him&s;elf with hot two-penny, which though he drank in very great quantities, yet he had never more than a pennyworth at a time.&mdash;Such a practice rendered him &s;o compleatly &s;otti&s;h, that even his abilities, as an author, became &s;en&s;ibly impaired.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned his being at Reading. His bu&s;ine&s;s there was to compile a Review of the mo&s;t material tran&s;actions at home and abroad, dur|ing the la&s;t war; in which he has included a &s;hort account of the late rebellion. For this work by which he got &s;ome reputation, he was paid by the &s;heet, a price &s;ufficient to keep him from &s;tarving, and that was all. To &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t that man be driven, who is de&s;titute of prudence to direct the efforts of his genius. In this work Mr. Boy&s;e di&s;covers how capable he was of the mo&s;t irk&s;ome and laborious employment, when he maintained a power over his appetites, and kept him&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> free from intemperance.</P>
<P>While he remained at Reading, he addre&s;&s;ed, by &s;upplicating letters, two Iri&s;h noblemen, lord Keny&s;ton, and lord King&s;tand, who re&s;ided in Berk&s;hire, and received &s;ome money from them; he al&s;o met with another gentleman there of a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, who, from the knowledge he had of the father, pitied the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the &s;on, and by his intere&s;t with &s;ome eminent Di&s;&s;enters in tho&s;e parts, rai&s;ed a &s;ufficient &s;um to cloath him,

<P>Upon his return from Reading, his behaviour was more decent than it had ever been before, and there were &s;ome hopes that a reformation, tho' late, would be wrought upon him. He was em|ployed by a Book&s;eller to tran&s;late Fenelon on the Exi&s;tence of God, during which time he married a &s;econd wife, a woman in low circum&s;tances, but well enough adapted to his ta&s;te. He began now to live with more regard to his cha|racter, and &s;upport a better appearance than u&s;ual; but while his circum&s;tances were mending, and his irregular appetites lo&s;ing ground, his health vi|&s;ibly declined: he had the &s;atisfaction, while in this lingering illne&s;s, to ob&s;erve a poem of his, entitled The Deity, recommended by two eminent writers, the ingenious Mr. Fielding, and the rev. Mr. James Harvey, author of The Meditations. The former, in the beginning of his humorous Hi&s;tory of Tom Jones, calls it an excellent poem. Mr. Harvey &s;tiles it a pious and in&s;tructive piece; and that worthy gentleman, upon hearing that the author was in nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances, depo&s;ited two guineas in the hands of a tru&s;ty per&s;on to be given him, whenever his occa&s;ions &s;hould pre&s;s. This poem was written &s;ome years before Mr. Harvey or Mr. Fielding took any notice of it, but it was lo&s;t to the public, as the reputation of the Book&s;eller con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ending into the world abundance of trifles, among&s;t which, it was con|&s;idered as one. Mr. Boy&s;e &s;aid, that upon its fir&s;t publication, a gentleman acquainted with Mr. Pope, took occa&s;ion to a&s;k that poet, if he was not the
<PB N="173" REF="178">
author of it, to which Mr. Pope replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that he was not the author, but that there were many lines in it, of which he &s;hould not be a&s;hamed.'</Q> This Mr. Boy&s;e con&s;idered as a very great compliment. The poem indeed abounds with &s;hining lines and elevated &s;entiments on the &s;everal Attributes of the Supreme Being; but then it is without a plan, or any connexion of parts, for it may be read either backwards or forwards, as the reader plea&s;es.</P>
<P>While Mr. Boy&s;e was in this lingering illne&s;s, he &s;eemed to have no notion of his approaching end, nor did he expect it, 'till it was almo&s;t pa&s;t the thinking of. His mind, indeed, was often re|ligiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed; he frequently talked upon that &s;ubject, and, probably &s;uffered a great deal from the remor&s;e of his con&s;cience. The early impre&s;&s;ions of his good education were never entirely obliterated, and his whole life was a continued &s;truggle between his will and rea&s;on, as he was always violating his duty to the one, while he fell under the &s;ub|jection of the other. It was in con&s;equence of this war in his mind, that he wrote a beautiful poem called The Recantation.</P>
<P>In the month of May, 1749, he died in ob&s;cure lodgings near Shoe-Lane. An old acquaintance of his endeavoured to collect money to defray the expences of his funeral, &s;o that the &s;candal of being buried by the pari&s;h might be avoided. But his endeavours were in vain, for the per&s;ons he &s;ollicited, had been &s;o troubled with applica|tions during the life of this unhappy man, that they refu&s;ed to contribute any thing towards his funeral. The remains of this &s;on of the mu&s;es were, with very little ceremony, hurried away by the pari&s;h officers, and thrown among&s;t common beggars; though with this di&s;tinction, that the &s;ervice of the church was performed over his corp&s;e. Never was an exit more &s;hocking, nor a life &s;pent with le&s;s grace, than tho&s;e of Mr. Boy&s;e,
<PB N="174" REF="179">
and never were &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities given to le&s;s purpo&s;e. His genius was not confined to po|etry only, he had a ta&s;te for painting, mu&s;ic and heraldry, with the latter of which he was very well acquainted. His poetical pieces, if collected, would make &s;ix moderate volumes. Many of them are &s;eattered in the Gentleman's Magazine, marked with the letter Y. and Alceus. Two volumes were publi&s;hed in London, but as they never had any great &s;ale, it will be difficult to find them.</P>
<P>An ode of his in the manner of Spen&s;er, en|titled The Olive, was addre&s;ied to Sir Robert Walpole, which procured him a pre&s;ent of ten guineas. He tran&s;lated a poem from the High Dutch of Van Haren, in prai&s;e of peace, upon the conclu&s;ion of that made at Aix la Chapelle; but the poem which procured him the greate&s;t re|putation, was, that upon the Attributes of the Deity, of which we have already taken notice. He was employed by Mr. Ogle to tran&s;late &s;ome of Chaucer's Tales into modern Engli&s;h, which he performed with great &s;pirit, and received at the rate of three pence a line for this trouble. Mr. Ogle publi&s;hed a complete edition of that old poet's Canterbury Tales Modernized; and Mr. Boy&s;e's name is put to &s;uch, Tales as were done by him. It had often been urged to Mr. Boy&s;e to turn his thoughts towards the drama, as that was the mo&s;t profitable kind of poetical writing and as many a poet of inferior genius to him has rai&s;ed large contributions on the public by the &s;ucce&s;s of their plays. But Boy&s;e never &s;eemed to reli&s;h this propo&s;al, perhaps from a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s that he had not &s;pirit to pro&s;ecute the arduous ta&s;k of introducing it on the &s;tage; or that he thought him&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k.</P>

<HEAD>Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent poet and phy&s;ician was &s;on of Mr. Robert Blackmore, an Attorney at Law. He received his early education at a pri|vate country &s;chool, from whence, in the 13th year of his age, he was removed to We&s;tmin&s;ter, and in a &s;hort time after to the univer&s;ity of Ox|ford, where he continued thirteen years.</P>
<P>In the early period of our author's life he was a Schoolma&s;ter, as appears by a &s;atirical copy of ver&s;es Dr. Drake wrote again&s;t him, con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of forty lines, of which the following are very pungent.<Q><L>By nature form'd, by want a pedant made,</L>

<L>In vain his drugs, as well as birch he tried;</L>
<L>His boys grew blockheads, and his patients died.</L></Q></P>
<P>Some circum&s;tances concurring, it may be pre|&s;umed in Sir Richard's favour, he travelled into Italy, and at Padua took his degrees in phy&s;ic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jacob.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He gratified his curio&s;ity in vi&s;iting France, Germany, and the Low Countries, and after &s;pend|ing a year and a half in this delightful exerci&s;e, he returned to England. As Mr. Blackmore had made phy&s;ic his chief &s;tudy, &s;o he repaired to
<PB N="178" REF="183">
London to enter upon the practice of it, and no long after he was cho&s;en fellow of the Royal Col|lege of Phy&s;icians, by the charter of King James II. Sir Richard had &s;een too much of foreign &s;lavery to be fond of dome&s;tic chains, and there|fore early declared him&s;elf in favour of the revo|lution, and e&s;pou&s;ed tho&s;e principles upon which it was effected. This zeal, recommended him to King William, and in the year 1697 he was &s;worn one of his phy&s;icians in ordinary. He was honoured by that Prince with a gold medal and chain, was likewi&s;e knighted by him, and upon his maje&s;ty's death was one of tho&s;e who gave their opinion in the opening of the king's body. Upon Queen Anne's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, he was appointed one of her phy&s;icians, and continued &s;o for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>This gentleman is author of more original poems, of a con&s;iderable length, be&s;ides a variety of other works, than can well be conceived could have been compo&s;ed by one man, during the longe&s;t period of human life. He was a cha&s;te writer; he &s;truggled in the cau&s;e of virtue, even in tho&s;e times, when vice had the counte|nance of the great, and when an almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al degeneracy prevailed. He was not afraid to appear the advocate of virtue, in oppo&s;ition to the highe&s;t authority, and no lu&s;tre of abilities in his opponents could deter him from &s;tripping vice of tho&s;e gaudy colours, with which poets of the fir&s;t eminence had cloathed her.</P>
<P>An elegant writer having occa&s;ion to mention the &s;tate of wit in the reign of King Charles II. characterizes the poets in the following manner;<Q><L>The wits of Charles found ea&s;ier ways to fame;</L>
<L>Nor &s;ought for John&s;on's art, nor Shake&s;pear's flame:</L>
<L>Them&s;elves they &s;tudied; as they lived, they writ,</L>
<L>Intrigue was p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, ob&s;cenity was wit.</L><L><PB N="179" REF="184">
Their cau&s;e was gen'ral, their &s;upports were &s;trong,</L>
<L>Their &s;laves were willing, and their reign was long.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pope &s;omewhere &s;ays,<Q><L>Unhappy Dryden&mdash;in all Charles's days,</L>
<L>Ro&s;common only boa&s;ts un&s;potted lays.</L></Q></P>
<P>He might likewi&s;e have excepted Blackmore, who was not only cha&s;te in his own writings, but endeavoured to correct tho&s;e who pro&s;tituted the gifts of heaven, to the inglorious purpo&s;es of vice and folly, and he was, at lea&s;t, as good a poet as Ro&s;common.</P>
<P>Sir Richard had, by the freedom of his cen&s;ures on the libertine writers of his age, incurred the heavy di&s;plea&s;ure of Dryden, who takes all op|portunities to ridicule him, and &s;omewhere &s;ays, that he wrote to the rumbling of his chariot wheels. And as if to be at enmity with Blackmore had been hereditary to our greate&s;t poets, we find Mr. Pope taking up the quarrel where Dryden left it, and per&s;ecuting this worthy man with yet a &s;everer degree of &s;atire. Blackmore had been informed by Curl, that Mr. Pope was the author of a Trave&s;tie on the fir&s;t P&s;alm, which he takes occa&s;ion to reprehend in his E&s;&s;ay on Polite Learn|ing, vol. ii. p. 270. He ever con&s;idered it as the di&s;grace of genius, that it &s;hould be employed to burle&s;que any of the &s;acred compo&s;itions, which as they &s;peak the language of in&s;piration, tend to awaken the &s;oul to virtue, and in&s;pire it with a &s;ublime devotion. Warmed in this honourable cau&s;e, he might, perhaps, &s;uffer his zeal to tran&s;port him to a height, which his enemies called enthu&s;ia&s;m; but of the two extremes, no doubt can be made, that Blackmore's was the &s;afe&s;t, and even dullne&s;s in fa|vour of virtue (which, by the way, was not the ca&s;e with Sir Richard) is more tolerable than the brighte&s;t
<PB N="180" REF="185">
parts employed in the cau&s;e of lewdne&s;s and debau|chery.</P>
<P>The poem for which Sir Richard had been mo&s;t celebrated, was, undoubtedly, his Creation, now de&s;ervedly become a cla&s;&s;ic. We cannot convey a more amiable idea of this great production, than in the words of Mr. Addi&s;on, in his Spec|tator, Nuumber 339, who, after having critici&s;ed on that book of Milton, which gives an account of the Works of Creation, thus proceeds, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I cannot conclude this book upon the Creation, without mentioning a poem which has lately appeared under that title. The work was undertaken with &s;o good an intention, and executed with &s;o great a ma&s;tery, that it de&s;erves to be looked upon as one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and noble pro|ductions in our Engli&s;h ver&s;e. The reader can|not but be plea&s;ed to find the depths of phi|lo&s;ophy, enlivened with all the charms of poe|try, and to &s;ee &s;o great a &s;trength of rea&s;on a|mid&s;t &s;o beautiful a redundancy of the imagi|nation. The author has &s;hewn us that de&s;ign in all the works of nature, which nece&s;&s;arily leads us to the knowledge of its fir&s;t cau&s;e. In &s;hort, he has illu&s;trated, by numberle&s;s and in|conte&s;table in&s;tances, that divine wi&s;dom, which the &s;on of Sirach has &s;o nobly a&s;cribed to the Supreme Being in his formation of the world, when he tells us, that he <HI>created her, and &s;aw her, and numbered her, and poured her out upon all his works.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this excellent poem is to demon|&s;trate the &s;elf-exi&s;tence of an eternal mind, from the created and dependent exi&s;tence of the uni|ver&s;e, and to confute the hypothefis of the Epi|cureans and the Fatali&s;ts, under whom all the pa|trons of impiety, ancient and modern, of what|&s;oever denomination may be ranged. The fir&s;t of whom affirm, the world was in time cau&s;ed by
<PB N="181" REF="186">
chance, and the other, that it exi&s;ted from eter|nity without a cau&s;e. 'Tis true, both the&s;e ac|knowledge the exi&s;tence of Gods, but by their ab&s;urd and ridiculous de&s;cription of them, it is plain, they had nothing el&s;e in view, but to a|void the obnoxious character of athei&s;tical philo|&s;ophers. To adorn this poem, no embelli&s;hments are borrowed from the exploded and ob&s;olete the|ology of the ancient idolaters of Greece and Rome; no rapturous invocations are addre&s;&s;ed to their idle deities, nor any allu&s;ions to their fabu|lous actions. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have more than once (&s;ays Sir Richard) publicly declared my opinion, that a Chri&s;tian poet cannot but appear mon&s;trous and ridiculous in a Pagan dre&s;s. That though it &s;hould be granted, that the Heathen religion might be allowed a place in light and loo&s;e &s;ongs, mock heroic, and the lower lyric com|po&s;itions, yet in Chri&s;tian poems, of the &s;ublime and greater kind, a mixture of the Pagan the|ology mu&s;t, by all who are ma&s;ters of reflexion and good &s;en&s;e, be condemned, if not as impi|ous, at lea&s;t, as impertinent and ab&s;urd. And this is a truth &s;o clear and evident, that I make no doubt it will, by degrees, force its way, and prevail over the contrary practice. Should Bri|tons recover their virtue, and reform their ta&s;te, they could no more bear the Heathen religion in ver&s;e, than in pro&s;e. Chri&s;tian poets, as well as Chri&s;tian preachers, the bu&s;ine&s;s of both be|ing to in&s;truct the people, though the la&s;t only are wholly appropriated to it, &s;hould endeavour to confirm, and &s;pread their own religion. If a divine &s;hould begin his &s;ermon with a &s;olemn prayer to Bacchus or Apollo, to Mars or Ve|nus, what would the people think of their preach|er? and is it not as really, though not equally ab&s;urd, for a poet in a great and &s;erious poem, wherein he celebrates &s;ome wonderful and hap|py

Perhaps it may be true, that the guardian angels of &s;tates and kingdoms may have been too power|ful for the conduct of Sir Richard Blackmore; but he has had at lea&s;t the merit of paving the way, and has &s;et an example how Epic Poems may be written, upon the principles of chri&s;tianity; and has enjoyed a comfort of which no bitterne&s;s, or raillery can deprive him, namely the virtuous intention of doing good, and as he him&s;elf ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'of re&s;cuing the Mu&s;es from the hands of ravi&s;hers, and re&s;toring them again to their cha&s;te and pure man&s;ions.'</Q></P>
<P>Sir Richard Blackmore died on the 9th of Octo|ber 1729, in an advanced age; and left behind him the character of a worthy man, a great poet, and a friend to religion. Towards the clo&s;e of his life, his bu&s;ine&s;s as a phy&s;ician declined, but as he was a man of prudent conduct, it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed that he was &s;ubjected to any want by that accident, for in his earlier years he was con&s;idered among&s;t the fir&s;t in his profe&s;&s;ion, and his practice was con&s;equently very exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>The decay of his employment might partly be owing to old age and infirmities, which rendered him le&s;s active than before, and partly to the dimi|nution his character might &s;uffer by the eternal war, which the wits waged again&s;t him, who &s;pared neither bitterne&s;s nor calumny; and, perhaps, Sir Richard may be deemed the only poet, who ever &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ffered for having too much religion and morality.</P>
<P>The fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lowing is the mo&s;t accurate account we could obtain of his writings, which for the &s;ake of di&s;tinction we have divided into cla&s;&s;es, by which the reader may di&s;cern how various and numerous his compo&s;itions are.&mdash;To have written &s;o much upon &s;o great a variety of &s;ubjects, and to have writ|ten nothing contemptibly, mu&s;t indicate a genius much &s;uperior to the common &s;tandard.&mdash;His ver|&s;ification is almo&s;t every where beautiful; and tho'
<PB N="185" REF="190">
he has been ridiculed in the Treati&s;e of the Bathos, publi&s;hed in Pope's works, for being too minute in his de&s;criptions of the objects of nature; yet it ra|ther proceeded from a philo&s;ophical exactne&s;s, than a penury of genius.</P>
<P>It is really a&s;toni&s;hing to find Dean Swift, join|ing i&s;&s;ue with le&s;s religious wits, in laughing at Blackmore's works, of which he makes a ludicrous detail, &s;ince they were all written in the cau&s;e of virtue, which it was the Dean's bu&s;ine&s;s more im|mediately to &s;upport, as on this account he enjoy'd his preferment: But the Dean perhaps, was one of tho&s;e characters, who cho&s;e to &s;acrifice his cau&s;e to his joke. This was a treatment Sir Richard could never have expected at the hands of a clergyman.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. JAMES THOMSON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS celebrated poet, from whom his coun|try has derived the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed ho|nour, was &s;on of the revd. Mr. Thom&s;on, a mi|ni&s;ter of the church of Scotland, in the Pre&s;by|tery of Jedburgh.</P>
<P>He was born in the place where his father was mini&s;ter, about the beginning of the pre&s;ent cen|tury, and received the rudiments of his education at a private country &s;chool. Mr. Thom&s;on, in the early part of his life, &s;o far from appearing to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;prightly genius, was con&s;idered by his &s;choolma&s;ter, and tho&s;e which directed his edu|cation, as being really without a common &s;hare of parts.</P>
<P>While he was improving him&s;elf in the Latin and Greek tongues at this country &s;chool, he often vi&s;ited a mini&s;ter, who&s;e charge lay in the &s;ame pre&s;bytery with his father's, the revd. Mr. Ricker on, a man of &s;uch amazing powers, that many per&s;ons of genius, as well as Mr. Thom&s;on, who conver&s;ed with him, have been a&s;toni&s;hed, that &s;uch great merit &s;hould be buried in an ob|&s;cure part of the country, where he had no op|portunity to di&s;play him&s;elf, and, except upon pe|riodical meetings of the mini&s;ters, &s;eldom an op|portunity of conver&s;ing with men of learning.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="196">
Though Mr. Thom&s;on's &s;choolma&s;ter could not di&s;cover that he was endowed with a common portion of under&s;tanding, yet Mr. Rickerton was not &s;o blind to his genius; he di&s;tingui&s;hed our author's early propen&s;ion to poetry, and had once in his hands &s;ome of the fir&s;t attempts Mr. Thom|&s;on ever made in that province.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted but our young poet greatly improved while he continued to conver&s;e with Mr. Rickerton, who, as he was a philo&s;o|phical man, in&s;pired his mind with a love of the &s;ciences, nor were the revd. gentleman's endea|vours in vain, for Mr. Thom&s;on has &s;hewn in his works how well he was acquainted with natural and moral philo&s;ophy, a circum&s;tance which, perhaps, is owing to the early impre&s;&s;ions he received from Mr. Rickerton.</P>
<P>Nature, which delights in diver&s;ifying her gifts, does not be&s;tow upon every one a power of di&s;playing the abilities &s;he her&s;elf has grant|ed to the be&s;t advantage. Though Mr. Ricker|ton could di&s;cover that Mr. Thom&s;on, &s;o far from being without parts, really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very fine genius, yet he never could have imagined, as he often declared, that there exi&s;ted in his mind &s;uch powers, as even by the be&s;t cultivation could have rai&s;ed him to &s;o high a degree of eminence a|mong&s;t the poets.</P>
<P>When Mr. Rickerton fir&s;t &s;aw Mr. Thom&s;on's Winter, which was in a Book&s;eller's &s;hop at Edinburgh, he &s;tood amazed, and after he had read the lines quoted below, he dropt the poem from his hand in the exta&s;y of admi|ration. The lines are his induction to Winter,

<L>'Till from the lucid chambers of the &s;outh</L>
<L>Look'd out the joyous &s;pring, look'd out and &s;mil'd.</L></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>After &s;pending the u&s;ual time at a country &s;chool in the acqui&s;ition of the dead languages, Mr. Thom&s;on was removed to the univer&s;ity of Edin|burgh, in order to fini&s;h his education, and be fitted for the mini&s;try. Here, as at the country &s;chool, he made no great figure: his companions thought contemptuou&s;ly of him, and the ma&s;ters under whom he &s;tudied, had not a higher opinion of our poet's abilities, than their pupils. His cour&s;e of attendance upon the cla&s;&s;es of philo&s;o|phy being fini&s;hed, he was entered in the Divi|nity Hall, as one of the candidates for the mi|ni&s;try, where the &s;tudents, before they are per|mitted to enter on their probation, mu&s;t yield &s;ix years attendance.</P>
<P>It was in the &s;econd year of Mr. Thom&s;on's attendance upon this &s;chool of divinity, who&s;e profe&s;&s;or at that time was the revd. and learned Mr. William Hamilton, a per&s;on whom he always mentioned with re&s;pect, that our author was ap|pointed by the profe&s;&s;or to write a di&s;cour&s;e on the Power of the Supreme Being. When his com|panions
<PB N="193" REF="198">
heard their ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him, they could not but arraign the profe&s;&s;or's judgment, for a&s;|&s;igning &s;o copious a theme to a young man, from whom nothing equal to the &s;ubject could be ex|pected. But when Mr. Thom&s;on delivered the di&s;cour&s;e, they had then rea&s;on to reproach them|&s;elves for want of di&s;cernment, and for indulg|ing a contempt of one &s;uperior to the brighte&s;t genius among&s;t them. This di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o &s;ub|limely elevated, that both the profe&s;&s;or and the &s;tudents who heard it delivered, were a&s;toni&s;hed. It was written in blank ver&s;e, for which Mr. Ha|milton rebuked him, as being improper upon that occa&s;ion. Such of his fellow-&s;tudents as envied him the &s;ucce&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e, and the admi|ration it procured him, employed their indu&s;try to trace him as a plagiary; for they could not be per&s;uaded that a youth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eemingly &s;o much removed from the appearance of genius, could compo&s;e a declamation, in which learning, genius, and judgment had a very great &s;hare. Their &s;earch, however, proved fruitle&s;s, and Mr. Thom&s;on con|tinued, while he remained at the univer&s;ity, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the honour of that di&s;cour&s;e, without any diminution.</P>
<P>We are not certain upon what account it was that Mr. Thom&s;on dropt the notion of going into the mini&s;try; perhaps he imagined it a way of life too &s;evere for the freedom of his di&s;po&s;ition: probably he declined becoming a pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own genius, which gave him a right, to entertain more ambitious views; for it &s;eldom happens, that a man of great parts can be content with ob&s;curity, or the low income of &s;ixty pounds a year, in &s;ome retired corner of a neglected country; which mu&s;t have been the lot
<PB N="194" REF="199">
of Thom&s;on, if he had not extended his views be|yond the &s;phere of a mini&s;ter of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of Scotland.</P>
<P>After he had dropt all thoughts of the clerical profe&s;&s;ion, he began to be more &s;ollicitous of di|&s;tingui&s;hing his genius, as he placed &s;ome depend|ence upon it, and hoped to acquire &s;uch patro|nage as would enable him to appear in life with advantage. But the part of the world where he then was, could not be very au&s;picious to &s;uch hopes; for which rea&s;on he began to turn his eyes towards the grand metropolis.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t poem of Mr. Thom&s;on's, which pro|cured him any reputation from the public, was his Winter, of which mention is already made, and further notice will be taken; but he had pri|vate approbation for &s;everal of his pieces, long be|fore his Winter was publi&s;hed, or before he quitted his native country. He wrote a Paraphra&s;e on the 104th P&s;alm, which, after it had received the ap|probation of Mr. Rickerton, he permitted his friends to copy. By &s;ome means or other this Pa|raphra&s;e fell into the hands of Mr. Auditor Ben|&s;on, who, expre&s;&s;ing his admiration of it, &s;aid, that he doubted not if the author was in Lon|don, but he would meet with encouragement equal to his merit. This ob&s;ervation of Ben&s;on's was communicated to Thom&s;on by a letter, and, no doubt, had its natural influence in inflaming his heart, and ha&s;tening his journey to the metropo|lis. He &s;oon &s;et out for Newca&s;tle, where he took &s;hipping, and landed at Billin&s;gate. When he arrived, it was his immediate care to wait on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mallet was his quondam &s;choolfellow (but much his junior) they contracted an early intimacy, which improved with their years, nor was it ever once di&s;turbed by any ca&s;ual mi&s;take, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y, or jealou&s;y on either &s;ide: a proof that two writers of merit may agree, in &s;pite of the common ob&s;ervation to the contrary.</NOTE>Mr. Mallet, who then lived in Hanover-Square
<PB N="195" REF="200">
in the character of tutor to his grace the duke of Montro&s;e, and his late brother lord G. Graham. Before Mr. Thom&s;on reached Hanover-Square, an accident happened to him, which, as it may di|vert &s;ome of our readers, we &s;hall here in&s;ert. He had received letters of recommendation from a gentleman of rank in Scotland, to &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction in London, which he had carefully tied up in his pocket-handkerchief. As he &s;aun|tered along the &s;treets, he could not withhold his admiration of the magnitude, opulence, and va|rious objects this great metropolis continually pre|&s;ented to his view. The&s;e mu&s;t naturally have di|verted the imagination of a man of le&s;s reflexion, and it is not greatly to be wondered at, if Mr. Thom&s;on's mind was &s;o ingro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e new pre&s;ented &s;cenes, as to be ab&s;ent to the bu&s;y crowds around him. He often &s;topped to grati|fy his curio&s;ity, the con&s;equences of which he af|terwards experienced. With an hone&s;t &s;implicity of heart, un&s;u&s;pecting, as unknowing of guilt, he was ten times longer in reaching Hanover-Square, than one le&s;s &s;en&s;ible and curious would have been. When he arrived, he found he had paid for his cu|rio&s;ity; his pocket was picked of his handkerchief, and all the letters that were wrapped up in it. This accident would have proved very mortifying to a man le&s;s philo&s;ophical than Thom&s;on; but he was of a temper never to be agitated; he then &s;miled at it, and frequently made his companions laugh at the relation.</P>
<P>It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that as &s;oon as Mr. Thom&s;on arrived in town, he &s;hewed to &s;ome of his friends his poem on Winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Winter was fir&s;t wrote in detached pieces, or occa&s;i|onal de&s;criptions; it was by the advice of Mr. Mallet they were collected and made into one connected piece.

By the farther advice, and at the earne&s;t reque&s;t, of Mr. Mallet, he wrote the other three &s;ea&s;ons.</NOTE>. The approba|tion

<P>The poem of Winter is, perhaps, the mo&s;t fi|ni&s;hed, as well as mo&s;t picture&s;que, of any of the Four Sea&s;ons. The &s;cenes are grand and lively. It is in that &s;ea&s;on that the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">tion appears in di|&s;tre&s;s, and nature a&s;&s;umes a melancholy air; and an imagination &s;o poetical as Thom&s;on's, could not but furni&s;h tho&s;e awful and &s;triking images, which &s;iil the &s;oul with a &s;olemn dread of <HI>tho&s;e Vapours, and Storms, and Clouds,</HI> he has &s;o well painted. De|&s;cription is the peculiar talent of Thom&s;on; we tremble at his thunder in &s;ummer, we &s;hiver with his winter's cold, and we rejoice at the renovation of nature, by the &s;weet influence of &s;pring. But the poem de&s;erves a further illu&s;tration, and we &s;hall take an opportunity of pointing out &s;ome of its mo&s;t &s;triking beauties; but before we &s;peak of the&s;e, we beg leave to relate the following anecdote.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Winter was publi&s;hed, Mr. Thom&s;on &s;ent a copy of it as a pre&s;ent to Mr. Jo&s;eph Mitchell, his countryman, and brother poet, who, not liking many parts of it, inclo&s;ed to him the following couplet;<Q><L>Beauties and faults &s;o thick lye &s;cattered here,</L>

<P>Upon a friend's remon&s;trating to Mr. Thom|&s;on, that the expre&s;&s;ion of bla&s;ted eye would look like a per&s;onal reflexion, as Mr. Mitchell had really that misfortune, he changed the epithet bla&s;t|ed, into bla&s;ting. But to return:</P>
<P>After our poet has repre&s;ented the influence of Winter upon the face of nature, and particularly de&s;cribed the &s;everities of the fro&s;t, he has the following beautiful tran&s;ition;<Q><L>&mdash;Our infant winter &s;inks,</L>

<P>As the induction of Mr. Thom&s;on's Winter has been celebrated for its &s;ublimity, &s;o the conclu&s;ion has likewi&s;e a claim to prai&s;e, for the tenderne&s;s of the &s;entiments, and the pathetic force of the ex|pre&s;&s;ion.

<P>The poem of Winter meeting with &s;uch general applau&s;e, Mr. Thom&s;on was induced to write the other three &s;ea&s;ons, which he fini&s;hed with equal &s;ucce&s;s. His Autumn was next given to the pub|lic, and is the mo&s;t unfini&s;hed of the four; it is not however without its beauties, of which many have con&s;idered the &s;tory of Lavinia, natu|rally and artfully introduced, as the mo&s;t affecting. The &s;tory is in it&s;elf moving and tender. It is perhaps no diminution to the merit of this beau|tiful tale, that the hint of it is taken from the book of Ruth in the Old Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>The author next publi&s;hed the Spring, the in|duction to which is very poetical and beautiful.<Q><L>Come gentle Spring, etherial mildne&s;s come,</L>
<L>And from the bo&s;om of yon dropping cloud,</L>
<L>While mu&s;ic wakes around, veil'd in a &s;how'r</L>
<L>Of &s;hadowing ro&s;es, on our plains de&s;cend.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is addre&s;&s;ed to the counte&s;s of Hertford, with the following elegant compliment,<Q><PB N="201" REF="206"><L>O Hertford! fitted, or to &s;hine in courts</L>

<P>The de&s;criptions in this poem are mild, like the &s;ea&s;on they paint; but towards the end of it, the poet takes occa&s;ion to warn his countrymen again&s;t indulging the wild and irregular pa&s;&s;ion of love. This digre&s;&s;ion is one of the mo&s;t affecting in the whole piece, and while he paints the language of a lover's brea&s;t agitated with the pangs of &s;trong de|&s;ire, and jealous tran&s;ports, he at the &s;ame time di&s;|&s;uades the ladies from being too credulous in the affairs of gallantry.

Summer has many manly and &s;triking beauties, of which the Hymn to the Sun, is one of the &s;u|blime&s;t and mo&s;t ma&s;terly efforts of genius we have ever &s;een.&mdash;There are &s;ome hints taken from Cowley's beautiful Hymn to Light.&mdash;Mr. Thom|&s;on has &s;ubjoined a Hymn to the Sea&s;ons, which is not inferior to the foregoing in poetical merit.</P>
<P>The Four Sea&s;ons con&s;idered &s;eparately, each Sea&s;on as a di&s;tinct poem has been judged de|fective in point of plan. There appears no parti|cular de&s;ign; the parts are not &s;ub&s;ervient to one another; nor is there any dependance or connection throughout; but this perhaps is a fault almo&s;t in&s;e|parable from a &s;ubject in it&s;elf &s;o diver&s;ified, as not to admit of &s;uch limitation. He has not indeed been guilty of any incongruity; the &s;cenes de|&s;cribed in &s;pring, are all peculiar to that &s;ea&s;on, and the digre&s;&s;ions, which make up a fourth part of the poem, flow naturally. He has ob&s;erved the &s;ame regard to the appearances of nature in the other &s;ea&s;ons; but then what he has de|&s;cribed in the beginning of any of the &s;ea&s;ons, might as well be placed in the middle, and that in the middle, as naturally towards the clo&s;e. So that each &s;ea&s;on may rather be called an a&s;&s;emblage of poetical ideas, than a poem, as it &s;eems written without a plan.</P>
<P>Mr. Thom&s;on's poetical diction in the Sea&s;ons is very peculiar to him: His manner of writing is en|tirely his own: He has introduced a number of compound words; converted &s;ub&s;tantives into verbs, and in &s;hort has created a kind of new language for him&s;elf. His &s;tile has been blamed for its &s;in|gularity and &s;tiffne&s;s; but with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uperior judges, we cannot but be of opinion, that though this ob&s;ervation is true, yet is it admirably fitted for de&s;cription. The object he paints &s;tands full be|fore the eye, we admire it in all its lu&s;tre, and who would not rather enjoy a perfect in&s;pection into a

natural curio&s;ity through a micro&s;cope capable of di&s;covering all the minute beauties, though its ex|terior form &s;hould not be comely, than perceive an object but faintly, through a micro&s;cope ill adapted for the purpo&s;e, however its out&s;ide may be deco|rated. Thom&s;on has a &s;tiffne&s;s in his manner, but then his manner is new; and there never yet aro&s;e a di&s;tingui&s;hed genius, who had not an air peculiarly his own. 'Tis true indeed, the tow'ring &s;ublimity of Mr. Thom&s;on's &s;tile is ill adapted for the tender pa&s;&s;ions, which will appear more fully when we con&s;ider him as a dramatic writer, a &s;phere in which he is not &s;o excellent as in other &s;pecies of poetry.</P>
<P>The merit of the&s;e poems introduced our author to the acquaintance and e&s;teem of &s;everal per&s;ons, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their rank, or eminent for their talents:&mdash;Among the latter Dr. Rundle, after|wards bi&s;hop of Derry, was &s;o plea&s;ed with the &s;pirit of benevolence and piety, which breathes throughout the Sea&s;ons, that he recommended him to the friend&s;hip of the late lord chancellor Talbot, who committed to him the care of his elde&s;t &s;on, then preparing to &s;et out on his travels into France and Italy.</P>
<P>With this young nobleman, Mr. Thom&s;on per|formed (what is commonly called) The Tour of Europe, and &s;tay'd abroad about three years, where no doubt he inriched his mind with the noble monuments of antiquity, and the conver&s;ation of ingenious foreign|ers. 'Twas by comparing modern Italy with the idea he had of the antient Romans, which furni&s;hed him with the hint of writing his Liberty, in three parts. The fir&s;t is Antient and Modern Italy com|pared. The &s;econd Greece, and the third Britain. The whole is addre&s;&s;ed to the elde&s;t &s;on of lord Talbot, who died in the year 1734, upon his tra|vels.</P>
<P>Among&s;t Mr. Thom&s;on's poems, is one to the memory of Sir I&s;aac Newton, of which we &s;hall

&s;ay no more than this, that if he had never wrote any thing be&s;ides, he de&s;erved to enjoy a di&s;tingui&s;h|ed reputation among&s;t the poets. Speaking of the amazing genius of Newton, he &s;ays,<Q><L>Th' aerial flow of &s;ound was known to him,</L>

<P>About the year 1728 Mr. Thom&s;on wrote a piece called Britannia, the purport of which was to rou&s;e the nation to arms, and excite in the &s;pirit of the people a generous di&s;po&s;ition to revenge the in|juries done them by the Spaniards: This is far from being one of his be&s;t poems.</P>

Upon the death of his generous patron, lord chan|cellor Talbot, for whom the nation joined with Mr. Thom&s;on in the mo&s;t &s;incere inward &s;orrow, he wrote an elegiac poem, which does honour to the author, and to the memory of that great man he meant to ce|lebrate. He enjoyed, during lord Talbot's life, a very profitable place, which that worthy patriot had con|ferred upon him, in recompence of the care he had taken in forming the mind of his &s;on. Upon his death, his lord&s;hip's &s;ucce&s;&s;or re&s;erved the place for Mr. Thom&s;on, and always expected when he &s;hould wait upon him, and by performing &s;ome formali|ties enter into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. This, how|ever, by an unaccountable indolence he neglected, and at la&s;t the place, which he might have enjoy|ed with &s;o little trouble, was be&s;towed upon ano|ther.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the late&s;t of Mr. Thom&s;on's productions is his Ca&s;tle of Indolence, a poem of &s;o extraordi|nary merit, that perhaps we are not extravagant, when we declare, that this &s;ingle performance di&s;|covers more genius and poetical judgment, than all his other works put together. We cannot here complain of want of plan, for it is artfully laid, naturally conducted, and the de&s;criptions ri&s;e in a beautiful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: It is written in imitation of Spen&s;er's &s;tile; and the ob&s;olete words, with the &s;implicity of diction in &s;ome of the lines, which bor|ders on the ludicrous, have been thought nece&s;&s;ary to make the imitation more perfect. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'The &s;tile (&s;ays Mr. Thom&s;on) of that admir|able poet, as well as the mea&s;ure in which he wrote, are, as it were, appropriated by cu&s;tom to all allegorical poems written in our language; ju&s;t as in French, the &s;tile of Marot, who lived under Francis the I&s;t, has been u&s;ed in Tales and familiar Epi&s;tles, by the polite&s;t writers of the age of Louis the XIVth.'</P></Q></P>

<P>The &s;peech of Sir Indu&s;try in the &s;econd Canto, when he enumerates the various ble&s;&s;ings which flow from action, is &s;urely one of the highe&s;t in&s;tances of genius which can be produced in poetry. In the &s;econd &s;tanza, before he enters upon the &s;ubject, the poet complains of the decay of patronage, and the general depravity of ta&s;te; and in the third breaks out into the following exclamation, which is &s;o perfectly beautiful, that it would be the greate&s;t mortification not to tran&s;cribe it,<Q><L>I care not, fortune, what you me deny:</L>

<P>We &s;hall now con&s;ider Mr. Thom&s;on as a drama|tic writer.</P>
<P>In the year 1730, about &s;ix years after he had been in London, he brought a Tragedy upon the &s;tage, called Sophoni&s;ba, built upon the Carthagi|nian hi&s;tory of that prince&s;s, and upon which the famous Nathaniel Lee has likewi&s;e written a Tra|gedy. This play met with a favourable reception from the public. Mrs. Oldfield greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf in the character of Sophoni&s;ba, which Mr. Thom&s;on acknowledges in his preface.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I can|not conclude, &s;ays he, without owning my obli|gations to tho&s;e concerned in the repre&s;entation. They have indeed done me more than ju&s;tice: Whatever was de&s;igned as amiable and engage|ing in Ma&s;ine&s;&s;a &s;hines out in Mr. Wilks's action. Mrs. Oldfield, in the character of Sophoni&s;ba, has excelled what even in the fondne&s;s of an author I could either wi&s;h or imagine. The grace, dignity and happy variety of her action, have been univer&s;ally applauded, and are truly ad|mirable.'</Q></P>
<P>Before we quit this play, we mu&s;t not omit two anecdotes which happened the fir&s;t night of the repre&s;entation. Mr. Thom&s;on makes one of his characters addre&s;s Sophoni&s;ba in a line, which &s;ome critics reckoned the fal&s;e pathetic.<Q><L>O! Sophoni&s;ba, Sophoni&s;ba Oh!</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon which a &s;mart from the pit cried out,
<Q><PB N="210" REF="215">
Oh! Jamey Thom&s;on, Jamey Thom&s;on Oh!</Q></P>
<P>However ill-natured this critic might be in in|terrupting the action of the play for &s;ake of a joke; yet it is certain that the line ridiculed does partake of the fal&s;e pathetic, and &s;hould be a warn|ing to tragic poets to guard again&s;t the &s;welling &s;tile; for by aiming at the &s;ublime, they are often betrayed into the bomba&s;t.&mdash;Mr. Thom&s;on who could not but feel all the emotions and &s;ollicitudes of a young author the fir&s;t night of his play, wanted to place him&s;elf in &s;ome ob&s;cure part of the hou&s;e, in order to &s;ee the repre&s;entation to the be&s;t advan|tage, without being known as the poet.&mdash;He ac|cordingly placed him&s;elf in the upper gal|lery; but &s;uch was the power of nature in him, that he could not help repeating the parts along with the players, and would &s;ometimes whi&s;per to him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">'now &s;uch a &s;cene is to open,'</Q> by which he was &s;oon di&s;covered to be the author, by &s;ome gen|tlemen who could not, on account of the great crowd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> in any other part of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>After an interval of four years, Mr. Thom&s;on exhibited to the public his &s;econd Tragedy called Agamemnon. Mr. Pope gave an in&s;tance of his great affection to Mr. Thom&s;on on this occa&s;ion: he wrote two letters in its favour to the managers, and honou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the repre&s;entation on the fir&s;t night with his pre&s;ence. As he had not been for &s;ome time at a play, this was con&s;idered as a very great in|&s;tance of e&s;teem. Mr. Thom&s;on &s;ubmitted to have this play con&s;iderably &s;hortened in the action, as &s;ome parts were too long, others unnece&s;&s;ary, in which not the character but the poet &s;poke; and though not brought on the &s;tage till the month of April, it continued to be acted with applau&s;e for &s;e|veral nights.</P>

Many have remark'd that his characters in his plays are more frequently de&s;criptive, than expre&s;|&s;ive, of the pa&s;&s;ions; but they all abound with un|common beauties, with fire, and depth of thought, with noble &s;entiments and nervous writing. His &s;peeches are often too long, e&s;pecially for an Engli&s;h audience; perhaps &s;ometimes they are unnaturally lengthened: and 'tis certainly a greater relief to the ear to have the dialogue more broken; yet our atten|tion is well rewarded, and in no pa&s;&s;ages, perhaps, in his tragedies, more &s;o, than in the affecting ac|count Meli&s;ander<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The mention of this name reminds me of an obligation I had to Mr. Thom&s;on; and, at once, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> opportunity offers, of gratefully acknowledging the favour, and doing my&s;elf ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I had the plea&s;ure of peru&s;ing the play of Agamemnon, be|fore it was introduced to the manager. Mr. Thom&s;on was &s;o thoroughly &s;atisfied (I might &s;ay more) with my reading of it; he &s;aid, he was confirmed in his de&s;ign of giving to me the part of Meli&s;ander. When I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;entiments of the fa|vour, he told me, he thought it none; that my old acquaint|ance Savage knew, he had not forgot my ta&s;te in reading the poem of Winter &s;ome years before: he added, that when (be|fore this meeting) he had expre&s;&s;ed his doubt, to which of the actors he &s;hould give this part (as he had &s;een but few plays &s;ince his return from abroad) Savage warmly urged, I was the fitte&s;t per&s;on, and, with an oath affirmed, that Theo. Cibber would ta&s;te it, feel it, and act it; perhaps he might extravagantly add, <Q REND="inline">'beyond any one el&s;e.'</Q> 'Tis likely, Mr. Savage might be then more vehement in this a&s;&s;ertion, as &s;ome of his friends had been more u&s;ed to &s;ee me in a comic, than a &s;erious light; and which was, indeed, more frequent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y my choice. But to go on. When I read the play to the manager, Mr. Quin, &amp;c. (at which &s;everal gentlemen, intimate friends of the author, were pre&s;ent) I was complimented by them all; Mr. Quin particularly declared, he never heard a play done &s;o much ju&s;tice to, in reading, through all its various parts. Mrs. Porter al&s;o (who on this occa&s;ion was to appear in the cha|racter of Clytemne&s;tra) &s;o much approved my entering into the ta&s;te, &s;en&s;e, and &s;pirit of the piece, that &s;he was plea&s;ed to de&s;ire me to repeat a reading of it, which, at her reque&s;t, and that of other principal performers, I often did; they all confe&s;&s;ed their approbation, with thanks.</P><P>When this play was to come forward into rehear&s;al, Mr. Thom&s;on told me, another actor had been recommended to him for this part in private, by the manager (who, by the way) our author, or any one el&s;e, never e&s;teemed as the be&s;t judge, of either play, or player. But money may purcha&s;e, and intere&s;t procure, a patent, though they cannot purcha&s;e ta&s;te, or parts) the per&s;on propo&s;ed was, po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ome favoured flatterer, the partner of his private plea&s;ures, or humble admirer of his table ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k: The&s;e little monarchs have their little courtiers. Mr. Thom&s;on in&s;i&s;ted on my keeping the part. He &s;aid, 'Twas his opinion, none but my&s;elf, or Mr. Quin, could do it any ju&s;tice; and, as that excellent actor could not be &s;pared from the part of Agamemnon (in the per&s;ormance of which character he added to his reputation, though before ju&s;tly rated as the fir&s;t actor of that time) be was perempto|ry for my appearing in it; I did &s;o, and acquitted my&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of the author and his friends (men eminent in rank, in ta&s;te, and knowledge) and received te&s;timonies of ap|probation from the audience, by their attention and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>By this time the reader may be ready to cry out, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'to what purpo&s;e is all this?'</Q> Have patience, &s;ir. As I gained reputa|tion in the forementioned character, is there any crime in ac|knowledging my obligation to Mr. Thom&s;on? or, am I un|pardonable, though I &s;hould pride my&s;elf on his good opinion and friend&s;hip? may not gratitude, as well as vanity, be con|cerned in this relation? but there is another rea&s;on that may &s;tand as an excu&s;e, for my being led into this long narrative; which, as it is only an annotation, not made part of our author's life, the reader, at his option, may peru&s;e, or pa&s;s it over, without being interrupted in his attention to what more im|mediately concerns Mr. Thom&s;on.</P>
<P>As what I have related is a truth, which living men of worth can te&s;tify; and as it evidently &s;hews that Mr. Savage's o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">inion of me as an actor was, in this latter part of his life, far from contemptible, of which, perhaps, in his earlier days he had too lavi&s;hly &s;poke; I thought this no improper (nor ill-timed) contradiction to a remark the writer of <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Publi&s;hed about the year</HI> 1743.</NOTE> Mr. Savage's Life has been plea&s;ed, in his Gait&eacute; de Coeur, to make, which almo&s;t amounts to an unhand&s;ome innuendo, that Mr. Savage, and &s;ome of his friends, thought me no ac|tor at all.</P>
<P>I accidentally met with the book &s;ome years ago, and dipt into that part where the author &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The preface (to Sir Thomas Overbu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y) contains a very liberal encomium on the blooming excellences of Mr. Theophilus Cibber, which Mr. Savage could not, in the latter part of his life, &s;ee his friends about to read, without &s;natching the play out of their hands.'</Q> As poor Savage was well remembered to have been as incon&s;iderate, incon&s;i&s;tent, and incon&s;tant a mortal as ever exi&s;ted, what he might have &s;aid carried but little weight; and, as he would blow both hot and cold, nay, too frequent|ly, to gratify the company pre&s;ent, would &s;acrifice the ab&s;ent, though his be&s;t friend, I di&s;regarded this invidious hint, 'till I was lately informed, a per&s;on of di&s;tinction in the learned world, had conde&s;cended to become the biographer of this unhappy man's unimportant life: as the &s;anction of &s;uch a name might prove of prejudice to me, I have &s;ince thought it worth my notice.</P>
<P>The truth is, I met Savage one &s;ummer, in a condition too melancholy for de&s;cription.

Neither my youth (for I was then but 18) or vani|ty, was &s;o devoid of judgment, as to prevent my objecting to it. I told him, I imagined this extravagancy would have &s;o contrary an effect to his intention, that what he kindly meant for prai&s;e, might be mi&s;interpreted, or render him liable to cen&s;ure, and me to ridicule; I in&s;i&s;ted on his omitting it: con|trary to his u&s;ual ob&s;tinacy, he con&s;ented, and &s;ent his orders to the Printer to leave it out; it was too late; the &s;heets were all work'd off, and the play was adverti&s;ed to come out (as it did) the next day.</P></NOTE> gives of his being betrayed, and left on the de&s;olate i&s;land.

<P>In the year 1736 Mr. Thom&s;on offered to the &s;tage a Tragedy called Edward and Eleonora, which was forbid to be acted, for &s;ome political rea&s;on, which it is not in our power to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>The play of Tancred and Sigi&s;munda was acted in the year 1744; this &s;ucceeded beyond any other
<PB N="215" REF="220">
of Thom&s;on's plays, and is now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage. The plot is borrowed from a &s;tory in the celebrated romance of Gil Blas: The fable is very intere&s;ting, the characters are few, but active; and the attention in this play is never &s;uf|fered to wander. The character of Seffredi has been ju&s;tly cen&s;ured as incon&s;i&s;tent, forced, and unnatural.</P>
<P>By the command of his royal highne&s;s the prince of Wales, Mr. Thom&s;on, in conjunction with Mr. Mallet, wrote the Ma&s;que of Alfred, which was per|formed twice in his royal highne&s;s's gardens at Cliff|den. Since Mr. Thom&s;on's death, this piece has been almo&s;t entirely new modelled by Mr. Mallet, and brought on the &s;tage in the year 1751, its &s;ucce&s;s being fre&s;h in the memory of its frequent auditors, 'tis needle&s;s to &s;ay more concerning it.</P>
<P>Mr. Thom&s;on's la&s;t Tragedy, called Coriolanus, was not acted till after his death; the profits of it were given to his &s;i&s;ters in Scotland, one of whom is married to a mini&s;ter there, and the other to a man of low circum&s;tances in the city of Edin|burgh. This play, which is certainly the lea&s;t ex|cellent of any of Thom&s;on's, was fir&s;t offered to Mr. Garrick, but he did not think proper to accept it. The prologue was written by Sir George Lyttle|ton, and &s;poken by Mr. Quin, which had a very happy effect upon the audience. Mr. Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n was the particular friend of Thom&s;on, and when he &s;poke the following lines, which are in them|&s;elves very tender, all the endearments of a long acquaintance, ro&s;e at once to his imagination, while the tears gu&s;hed from his eyes.<Q><L>He lov'd his friends (forgive this gu&s;hing tear:</L>
<L>Alas! I feel I am no actor here)</L>
<L>He lov'd his friends with &s;uch a warmth of heart,</L>
<L>So clear of int're&s;t, &s;o devoid of art,</L>
<L><PB N="216" REF="221">
Such generous freedom, &s;uch un&s;haken zeal,</L>
<L>No words can &s;peak it, but our tears may tell.</L></Q></P>
<P>The beautiful break in the&s;e lines had a fine effect in &s;peaking. Mr. Quin here excelled him|&s;elf; he never appeared a greater actor than at this in&s;tant, when he declared him&s;elf none: 'twas an exqui&s;ite &s;troke to nature; art alone could hardly reach it Pardon the digre&s;&s;ion, reader, but, we feel a de&s;ire to &s;ay &s;omewhat more on this head. The poet and the actor were friends, it cannot then be quite foreign to the purpo&s;e to proceed. A deep-fetch'd &s;igh filled up the heart felt pau&s;e; grief &s;pread o'er all the countenance; the tear &s;tarted to the eye, the mu&s;cles fell, and,
<Q><L>' The whitene&s;s of his cheek</L>
<L>' Was apter than his tongue to &s;peak his tale.'</L></Q>
They all expre&s;&s;ed the tender feelings of a manly heart, becoming a Thom&s;on's friend. His pau&s;e, his recovery were ma&s;terly; and he delivered the whole with an empha&s;is and pathos, worthy the excellent lines he &s;poke; worthy the great poet and good man, who&s;e merits they painted, and who&s;e lo&s;s they deplored.</P>
<P>The epilogue too, which was &s;poken by Mrs. Woffington, with an exqui&s;ite humour, greatly plea&s;ed. The&s;e circum&s;tances, added to the con|&s;ideration of the author's being no more, procured this play a run of nine nights, which without the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances 'tis likely it could not have had; for, without playing the critic, it is not a piece of equal merit to many other of his works. It was his misfortune as a dramati&s;t, that he never knew when to have done; he makes every character &s;peak while there is any thing to be &s;aid; and during the&s;e long
<PB N="217" REF="222">
interviews, the action too &s;tands &s;till, and the &s;tory langui&s;hes. His Tancred and Sigi&s;munda may be excepted from this general cen&s;ure: But his cha|racters are too little di&s;tingui&s;hed; they &s;eldom vary from one another in their manner of &s;peaking. In &s;hort, Thom&s;on was born a de&s;criptive poet; he only wrote for the &s;tage, from a motive too obvi|ous to be mentioned, and too &s;trong to be re&s;i&s;ted. He is indeed the elde&s;t born of Spen&s;er, and he has often confe&s;&s;ed that if he had any thing excellent in poetry, he owed it to the in&s;piration he fir&s;t received from reading the Fairy Queen, in the very early part of his life.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t 1748 the world was deprived of this great ornament of poetry and genius, by a violent fever, which carried him off in the 48th year of his age. Before his death he was provided for by Sir George Littleton, in the profitable place of comp|troller of America, which he lived not long to en|joy. Mr. Thom&s;on was extremely beloved by his acquaintance. He was of an open generous di&s;po&s;i|tion; and was &s;ometimes tempted to an exce&s;&s;ive indulgence of the &s;ocial plea&s;ures: A failing too frequently in&s;eparable from men of genius. His ex|terior appearance was not very engaging, but he grew more and more agreeable, as he entered into conver&s;ation: He had a grateful heart, ready to acknowledge every favour he received, and he never forgot his old benefactors, notwith&s;tanding a long|ab&s;ence, new acquaintance, and additional emi|nence; of which the following in&s;tance cannot be unacceptable to the reader.</P>
<P>Some time before Mr. Thom&s;on's fatal illne&s;s, a gentleman enquired for him at his hou&s;e in Kew-Lane, near Richmond, where he then lived. This gentleman had been his acquaintance when very young, and proved to be Dr. Gu&s;tard, the &s;on of a revd. mini&s;ter in the city of Edinburgh. Mr. Gu&s;tard had been Mr. Thom&s;on's patron in the early
<PB N="218" REF="223">
part of his life, and contributed from his own pur&s;e (Mr. Thom&s;on's father not being in very affluent circum&s;tances) to enable him to pro&s;ecute his &s;tudies. The vi&s;itor &s;ent not in his name, but only inti|mated to the &s;ervant that an old acquaintance de|&s;ired to &s;ee Mr. Thom&s;on. Mr. Thom&s;on came forward to receive him, and looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at him (for they had not &s;een one another for many years) &s;aid, Troth Sir, I cannot &s;ay I ken your countenance well&mdash;Let me therefore crave your name.

<P>It is a true ob&s;ervation, that whenever gratitude is ab&s;ent from a heart, it is generally capable of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate ba&s;ene&s;s; and on the other hand, where that generous virtue has a powerful preva|lence in the &s;oul, the heart of &s;uch a man is fraught with all tho&s;e other endearing and tender qualities, which con&s;titute goodne&s;s.

<HEAD>ALEXANDER POPE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS illu&s;trious poet was born at London, in 1688, and was de&s;cended from a good fa|mily of that name, in Oxford&s;hire, the head of which was the earl of Downe, who&s;e &s;ole heire&s;s married the earl of Lind&s;ey. His father, a man of primitive &s;implicity, and integrity of manners, was a mer|chant of London, who upon the Revolution quit|ted trade, and converted his effects into money, amounting to near 10,000 l. with which he retired into the country; and died in 1717, at the age of 75.</P>
<P>Our poet's mother, who lived to a very advanced age, being 93 years old when &s;he died, in 1733, was the daughter of William Turner, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of York. She had three brothers, one of whom was killed, another died in the &s;ervice of king Charles; and the elde&s;t following his fortunes, and becoming a general officer in Spain, left her what e&s;tate re|mained after &s;eque&s;tration, and forfeitures of her family. To the&s;e circum&s;tances our poet alludes in his epi&s;tle to Dr. Arbuthnot, in which he mentions his parents.<Q><L>Of gentle blood (part &s;hed in honour's cau&s;e,</L>

<P>The education of our great author was attended with circum&s;tances very &s;ingular, and &s;ome of them extremely unfavourable; but the amazing force of his genius fully compen&s;ated the want of any advan|tage in his earlie&s;t in&s;truction. He owed the know|ledge of his letters to an aunt; and having learned very early to read, took great delight in it, and taught him&s;elf to write by copying after printed books, the characters of which he could imitate to great perfection. He began to compo&s;e ver&s;es, far|ther back than he could well remember; and at eight years of age, when he was put under one Taverner a prie&s;t, who taught him the rudiments of the Latin and Greek tongues at the &s;ame time, he met with Ogilby's Homer, which gave him great delight; and this was encrea&s;ed by Sandys's Ovid: The raptures which the&s;e authors, even in the di&s;|gui&s;e of &s;uch tran&s;lations, then yielded him, were &s;o &s;trong, that he &s;poke of them with plea&s;ure ever after. From Mr. Taverner's tuition he was &s;ent to a private &s;chool at Twiford, near Winche&s;ter, where he continued about a year, and was then removed to another near Hyde Park Corner; but was &s;o un|fortunate as to lo&s;e under his two la&s;t ma&s;ters, what he had acquired under the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="226">
While he remained at this &s;chool, being permit|ted to go to the play-hou&s;e, with &s;ome of his &s;chool fellows of a more advanced age, he was &s;o charmed with dramatic repre&s;entations, that he formed the tran&s;lation of the Iliad into a play, from &s;everal of the &s;peeches in Ogilby's tran&s;lation, connected with ver&s;es of his own; and the &s;everal parts were per|formed by the upper boys of the &s;chool, except that of Ajax by the ma&s;ter's gardener. At the age of 12 our young poet, went with his father to re|&s;ide at his hou&s;e at Binfield, in Wind&s;or fore&s;t, where he was for a few months under the tuition of another prie&s;t, with as little &s;ucce&s;s as before; &s;o that he re&s;olved now to become his own ma&s;ter, by reading tho&s;e Cla&s;&s;ic Writers which gave him mo&s;t entertainment; and by this method, at fifteen he gained a ready habit in the learned languages, to which he &s;oon after added the French and Italian. Upon his retreat to the fore&s;t, he became fir&s;t ac|quainted with the writings of Waller, Spen&s;er and Dryden; in the la&s;t of which he immediately found what he wanted; and the poems of that excellent writer were never out of his hands; they became his model, and from them alone he learned the whole magic of his ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of our author's compo&s;itions now extant in print, is an Ode on Solitude, written before he was twelve years old: Which, con&s;ider'd as the pro|duction of &s;o early an age, is a perfect ma&s;ter piece; nor need he have been a&s;hamed of it, had it been writ|ten in the meridian of his genius. While it breathes the mo&s;t delicate &s;pirit of poetry, it at the &s;ame time demon&s;trates his love of &s;olitude, and the ra|tional plea&s;ures which attend the retreats of a con|tented country life.</P>
<P>Two years after this he tran&s;lated the fir&s;t Book of Statius' Thebais, and wrote a copy of ver&s;es on Silence, in imitation of the Earl of Roche&s;ter's

<P>Though we have had frequent opportunity to ob|&s;erve, that poets have given early di&s;plays of genius, yet we cannot recollect, that among the in&s;pired tribe, one can be found who at the age of twelve could produce &s;o animated an Ode; or at the age of fourteen tran&s;late from the Latin. It has been reported indeed, concerning Mr. Dryden, that when he was at We&s;tmin&s;ter-School, the ma&s;ter who had a&s;&s;igned a poetical ta&s;k to &s;ome of the boys, of writ|ing a Paraphra&s;e on our Saviour's Miracle, of turn|ing Water into Wine, was perfectly a&s;toni&s;hed when young Dryden pre&s;ented him with the following line, which he a&s;&s;erted was the be&s;t comment could be written upon it.<Q><L>The con&s;cious water &s;aw its God, and blu&s;h'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>This was the only in&s;tance of an early appear|ance of genius in this great man, for he was turn'd of 30 before he acquired any reputation; an age in which Mr. Pope's was in its full di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The year following that in which Mr. Pope wrote his poem on Silence, he began an Epic Poem, intitled Alcander, which he afterwards very judici|ou&s;ly committed to the flames, as he did likewi&s;e a Comedy, and a Tragedy; the latter taken from a &s;tory in the legend of St. Genevieve; both of the&s;e being the product of tho&s;e early days. But his Pa&s;torals, which were written in 1704, when he was only 16 years of age, were e&s;teemed by Sir
<PB N="223" REF="228">
William Trumbull, Mr. Granville, Mr. Wycherley, Mr. Wal&s;h and others of his friends, too valuable to be condemned to the &s;ame &s;ate.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope's Pa&s;torals are four, viz.<LIST>
<ITEM>Spring. addre&s;s'd to Sir William Trumbull,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Summer, to Dr. Garth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Autumn, to Mr. Wycherley.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Winter, in memory of Mrs. Tempe&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The three great writers of Pa&s;toral Dialogue, which Mr. Pope in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;eems to imitate, are Theocritus, Virgil, and Spen&s;er. Mr. Pope is of opinion, that Theocritus excells all others in nature and &s;implicity.</P>
<P>That Virgil, who copies Theocritus, refines on his original; and in all points in which judgment has the principal part is much &s;uperior to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>That among the moderns, their &s;ucce&s;s has been greate&s;t who have mo&s;t endeavoured to make the&s;e antients their pattern. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable genius appears in the famous Ta&s;&s;o, and our Spen&s;er. Ta&s;&s;o in his Aminta has far excelled all the pa&s;toral writers, as in his Gieru&s;alemme he has outdone the Epic Poets of his own country. But as this piece &s;eems to have been the original of a new &s;ort of poem, the Pa&s;toral Comedy, in Italy, it cannot &s;o well be con&s;idered as a copy of the antients. Spen|&s;er's Calendar, in Mr. Dryden's opinion, is the mo&s;t compleat work of this kind, which any nation has produced ever &s;ince the time of Virgil. But this he &s;aid before Mr. Pope's Pa&s;torals appeared.</P>
<P>Mr. Wal&s;h pronounces on our Shepherd's Boy (as Mr. Pope called him&s;elf) the following judgment, in a letter to Mr. Wycherly. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'The ver&s;es are very tender and ea&s;y. The author &s;eems to have a particular genius for that kind of poetry, and a judgment that much

exceeds the years, you told me he was of. It is no flattery at all to &s;ay, that Virgil had written nothing &s;o good at his age. I &s;hall take it as a favour if you will bring me acquainted with him; and if he will give him&s;elf the trouble, any morning, to call at my hou&s;e, I &s;hall be very glad to read the ver&s;es with him, and give him him my opinion of the particulars more largely than I can well do in this letter.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus early was Mr. Pope introduced to the ac|quaintance of men of genius, and &s;o improved every advantage, that he made a more rapid progre&s;s to|wards a con&s;ummation in fame, than any of our for|mer Engli&s;h poets. His Me&s;&s;iah; his Wind&s;or-Fore&s;t, the fir&s;t part of which was written at the &s;ame time with his pa&s;torals; his E&s;&s;ay on Criti|ci&s;m in 1709, and his Rape of the Lock in 1712, e&s;tabli&s;hed his poetical character in &s;uch a man|ner, that he was called upon by the public voice, to enrich our language with the tran&s;lation of the Iliad; which he began at 25, and executed in five years. This was publi&s;hed for his own benefit, by &s;ub&s;cription, the only kind of reward, which he received for his writings, which do honour to our age and country: His religion rendering him inca|pable of a place, which the lord trea&s;urer, Oxford u&s;ed to expre&s;s his concern for, but without offer|ing him a pen&s;ion, as the earl of Halifax, and Mr. Secretary Craggs afterwards did, though Mr. Pope declined it.</P>
<P>The reputation of Mr. Pope gaining every day upon the world, he was care&s;&s;ed, flattered, and railed at; according as he was feared, or loved by different per&s;ons. Mr. Wycherley was among&s;t the fir&s;t authors of e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation, who contri|buted to advance his fame, and with whom he for &s;ome time lived in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved intimacy. This poet, in his old age, conceived a de&s;ign of publi&s;hing his poems, and as he was but a very
<PB N="225" REF="230">
mperfect ma&s;ter of numbers, he entru&s;ted his ma|nu&s;cripts to Mr. Pope, and &s;ubmitted them to his correction. The freedom which our young bard was under a nece&s;&s;ity to u&s;e, in order to poli&s;h and refine what was in the original, rough, unharmo|nious, and indelicate, proved di&s;gu&s;tful to the old gentleman, then near 70, who, perhaps, was a lit|tle a&s;hamed, that a boy at 16 &s;hould &s;o &s;everely cor|rect his works. Letters of di&s;&s;atisfaction were written by Mr. Wycherley, and at la&s;t he informed him, in few words, that he was going out of town, with|out mentioning to what place, and did not expect to hear from him 'till he came back. This cold indifference extorted from Mr. Pope a prote&s;tation, that nothing &s;hould induce him ever to write to him again. Notwith&s;tanding this peevi&s;h behavi|our of Mr. Wycherley, occa&s;ioned by jealou&s;y and infirmities, Mr. Pope pre&s;erved a con&s;tant re&s;pect and reverence for him while he lived, and after his death lamented him. In a letter to Edward Blount, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> written immediately upon the death of this poet, he has there related &s;ome anecdotes of Wy|cherly, which we &s;hall in&s;ert here, e&s;pecially as they are not taken notice of in his life.<LETTER>

<P>One of the mo&s;t affecting and tender compo&s;iti|ons of Mr. Pope, is, his Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady, built on a true &s;tory. We are informed in the Life of Pope, for which Curl ob|tained a patent, that this young lady was a particular favourite of the poet, though it is not a&s;certained whether he him&s;elf was the per&s;on from whom &s;he was removed. This young lady was of very high birth, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an opulent fortune, and under the tutorage of an uncle, who gave her an educa|tion &s;uitable to her titles and preten&s;ions. She was e&s;teemed a match for the greate&s;t peer in the realm, but, in her early years, &s;he &s;uffered her

heart to be engaged by a young gentleman, and in con&s;equence of this attachment, rejected offers made to her by per&s;ons of quality, &s;econded by the &s;ollicitations of her uncle. Her guardian be|ing &s;urprized at this behaviour, &s;et &s;pies upon her, to find out the real cau&s;e of her indifference. Her corre&s;pondence with her lover was &s;oon di&s;|covered, and, when urged upon that topic, &s;he had too much truth and honour to deny it. The uncle finding, that &s;he would make no efforts to di&s;engage her affection, after a little time forced her abroad, where &s;he was received with a cere|mony due to her quality, but re&s;tricted from the conver&s;ation of every one, but the &s;pies of this &s;e|vere guardian, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for her lover even to have a letter delivered to her hands. She langui&s;hed in this place a con&s;iderable time, bore an infinite deal of &s;ickne&s;s, and was over|whelmed with the profounde&s;t &s;orrow. Nature be|ing wearied out with continual di&s;tre&s;s, and being driven a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> la&s;t to de&s;pair, the unfortunate lady, as Mr. Pope ju&s;tly calls her, put an end to her own life, having bribed a maid-&s;ervant to procure her a &s;word. She was found upon the ground weltering in her blood. The &s;everity of the laws of the place, where this fair unfortunate peri&s;hed, denied her Chri&s;tian burial, and &s;he was interred without &s;olemnity, or even any attendants to per|form the la&s;t offices of the dead, except &s;ome young people of the neighbourhood, who &s;aw her put into common ground, and &s;trewed the grave with flowers.</P>
<P>The poet in the elegy takes occa&s;ion to mingle with the tears of &s;orrow, ju&s;t reproaches upon her cruel uncle, who drove her to this violation.<Q><L>But thou, fal&s;e guardian of a charge too good,</L>

<P>No poem of our author's more de&s;ervedly ob|tained him reputation, than his E&s;&s;ay on Criti|ci&s;m. Mr. Addi&s;on, in his Spectator, No. 253, has celebrated it with &s;uch profu&s;e terms of ad|miration, that it is really a&s;toni&s;hing, to find the &s;ame man endeavouring afterwards to dimini&s;h that fame he had contributed to rai&s;e &s;o high. <Q REND="inline"><P>"The art of critici&s;m (&s;ays he) which was pub|li&s;hed &s;ome months ago, is a ma&s;ter-piece in its kind.

<P>In the Lives of Addi&s;on and Tickell, we have thrown out &s;ome general hints concerning the quarrel which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between our poet and the former of the&s;e gentlemen; here it will not be improper to give a more particular account of it.</P>
<P>The author of Mi&s;t's Journal po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that Mr. Addi&s;on rai&s;ed Pope from ob&s;curity, obtained him the acquaintance and friend&s;hip of the whole body of our nobility, and transferred his powerful influence with tho&s;e great men to this ri&s;ing bard, who frequently levied by that means, unu&s;ual contributions on the public.

<P>When this charge of ingratitude and di&s;honour was publi&s;hed again&s;t Mr. Pope, to acquit him&s;elf of it, he called upon any nobleman, who&s;e friend&s;hip, or any one gentleman, who&s;e &s;ub&s;crip|tion Mr. Addi&s;on had procured to our author, to &s;tand forth, and declare it, that truth might ap|pear.

<P>Some readers may think the&s;e lines &s;evere, but the treatment he received from Mr. Addi&s;on, was more than &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify them, which will ap|pear when we particularize an interview between the&s;e two poetical antagoni&s;ts, procured by the warm &s;ollicitations of Sir Richard Steele, who was pre|&s;ent at it, as well as Mr. Gay.</P>
<P>Mr. Jervas being one day in company with Mr. Addi&s;on, the conver&s;ation turned upon Mr. Pope, for whom Addi&s;on, at that time, expre&s;&s;ed the high|e&s;t regard, and a&s;&s;ured Mr. Jervas, that he would make u&s;e not only of his intere&s;t, but of his art likewi&s;e, to do Mr. Pope &s;ervice; he then &s;aid, he did not mean his art of poetry, but his art at court, and prote&s;ted, notwith&s;tanding many in&s;inu|ations were &s;pread, that it &s;hall not be his fault, if there was not the be&s;t under&s;tanding and intel|ligence between them. He ob&s;erved, that Dr. Swift might have carried him too far among the enemy, during the animo&s;ity, but now all was &s;afe, and Mr. Pope, in his opinion, was e&s;caped. When Mr. Jervas communicated this conver&s;ation to Mr. Pope, he made this reply: <Q REND="inline">'The friendly office you endeavour to do between Mr. Ad|di&s;on and me de&s;erves acknowledgments on my part. You thoroughly know my regard to his character, and my readine&s;s to te&s;tify it by all ways in my power; you al&s;o thoroughly knew the meanne&s;s of that proceeding of Mr. Phillips, to make a man I &s;o highly value &s;u&s;pect my

di&s;po&s;ition towards him. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> after all, Mr. Addi&s;on mu&s;t be judge in what regards him&s;elf, and as he has &s;eemed not to be a very ju&s;t one to me, &s;o I mu&s;t own to you, I expect nothing but civility from him, how much &s;oever I wi&s;h for his friend&s;hip; and as for any offers of real kind|ne&s;s or &s;ervice which it is in his power to do me, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to receive them from a man, who has no better opinion of my morals, than to think me a party man, nor of my temper, than to believe me capable of maligning, or envying another's reputation as a poet. In a word, Mr. Addi&s;on is &s;ure of my re&s;pect at all times, and of my real friend&s;hip, whenever he &s;hall think fit to know me for what I am.'</Q></P>
<P>Some years after this conver&s;ation, at the de&s;ire of Sir Richard Steele, they met. At fir&s;t, a very cold ci|vility, and nothing el&s;e appeared on either &s;ide, for Mr. Addi&s;on had a natural re&s;erve and gloom at the beginning of an evening, which, by con|ver&s;ation and a gla&s;s, brightened into an ea&s;y chear|fulne&s;s. Sir Richard Steele, who was a mo&s;t &s;ocial benevolent man, begged of him to fulfill his promi&s;e, in dropping all animo&s;ity again&s;t Mr. Pope. Mr. Pope then de&s;ired to be made &s;en&s;ible how he had of|fended; and ob&s;erved, that the tran&s;lation of Ho|mer, if that was the great crime, was undertaken at the reque&s;t, and almo&s;t at the command of Sir Richard Steele. He entreated Mr. Addi&s;on to &s;peak candidly and freely, though it might be with ever &s;o much &s;everity, rather than by keeping up forms of complai&s;ance, conceal any of his faults. This Mr. Pope &s;poke in &s;uch a manner as plainly indicated he thought Mr. Addi&s;on the aggre&s;&s;or, and expected him to conde&s;cend, and own him|&s;elf the cau&s;e of the breach between them. But he was di&s;appointed; for Mr. Addi&s;on, without ap|pearing to be angry, was quite overcome with it. He began with declaring, that he always had wi&s;hed
<PB N="233" REF="238">
him well, had often endeavoured to be his friend, and in that light advi&s;ed him, if his nature was capable of it, to dive&s;t him&s;elf of part of his vanity, which was too great for his merit; that he had not arrived yet to that pitch of excellence he might ima|gine, or think his mo&s;t partial readers imagined; that when he and Sir Richard Steele corrected his ver&s;es, they had a different air; reminding Mr. Pope of the amendment (by Sir Richard) of a line, in the poem called The MESSIAH.<Q>He wipes the tears for ever from our eyes.</Q> Which is taken from the prophet I&s;aiah,<Q>The Lord God will wipe all tears from off all faces.</Q>
<Q>From every face he wipes off ev'ry tear.</Q> And it &s;tands &s;o altered in the newer editions of Mr. Pope's works. He proceeded to lay before him all the mi&s;takes and inaccuracies hinted at by the writers, who had attacked Mr. Pope, and added many things, which he him&s;elf objected to. Speaking of his tran&s;lation in general, he &s;aid, that he was not to be blamed for endeavouring to get &s;o large a &s;um of money, but that it was an ill-executed thing, and not equal to Tickell, which had all the &s;pirit of Homer. Mr. Addi&s;on concluded, in a low hollow voice of feigned tem|per, that he was not &s;ollicitous about his own fame as a poet; that he had quitted the mu&s;es to enter into the bu&s;ine&s;s of the public, and that all he &s;poke was though friend&s;hip to Mr. Pope, whom he ad|vi&s;ed to have a le&s;s exalted &s;en&s;e of his own merit.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope could not well bear &s;uch repeated re|proaches, but bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly told Mr. Addi&s;on, that he ap|pealed from his judgment to the public, and that
<PB N="234" REF="239">
he had long known him too well to expect any friend&s;hip from him; upbraided him with being a pen&s;ioner from his youth, &s;acrificing the very learn|ing purcha&s;ed by the public money, to a mean thir&s;t of power; that he was &s;ent abroad to encou|rage literature, in place of which he had always endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s merit. At la&s;t, the conte&s;t grew &s;o warm, that they parted without any cere|mony, and Mr. Pope upon this wrote the foregoing ver&s;es, which are e&s;teemed too true a picture of Mr. Addi&s;on.</P>
<P>In this account, and, indeed, in all other ac|counts, which have been given concerning this quarrel, it does not appear that Mr. Pope was the aggre&s;&s;or. If Mr. Addi&s;on entertained &s;u&s;pici|ons of Mr. Pope's being carried too far among the enemy, the danger was certainly Mr. Pope's, and not Mr. Addi&s;on's. It was his misfortune, and not his crime. If Mr. Addi&s;on &s;hould think him&s;elf capable of becoming a rival to Mr. Pope, and, in con&s;equence of this opinion, publi&s;h a tran&s;lation of part of Homer; at the &s;ame time with Mr. Pope's, and if the public &s;hould decide in favour of the latter by reading his tran&s;lation, and neglecting the other, can any fault be imputed to Mr. Pope? could he be blamed for exerting all his abilities in &s;o arduous a province? and was it his fault that Mr. Addi&s;on (for the fir&s;t book of Homer was undoubtedly his) could not tran&s;late to plea&s;e the public? Be&s;ides, was it not &s;omewhat pre&s;umptuous to in&s;inuate to Mr. Pope, that his ver&s;es bore another face when he corrected them, while, at the &s;ame time, the tran&s;lation of Homer, which he had never &s;een in manu&s;cript, bore away the palm from that very tran&s;lation, he him&s;elf a&s;&s;erted wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> done in the true &s;pirit of Homer? In matters of genius the public judgment &s;eldom errs, and in this ca&s;e po&s;te|rity has confirmed the &s;entence of that age, which gave the preference to Mr. Pope; for his tran&s;la|tion
<PB N="235" REF="240">
is in the hands of all readers of ta&s;te, while the other is &s;eldom regarded but as a foil to Pope's.</P>
<P>It would appear as if Mr. Addi&s;on were him&s;elf &s;o immer&s;ed in party bu&s;ine&s;s, as to contract his benevolence to the limits of a faction: Which was infinitely beneath the views of a philo&s;opher, and the rules which that excellent writer him&s;elf e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. If this was the failing of Mr. Addi&s;on, it was not the error of Pope, for he kept the &s;tricte&s;t cor|re&s;pondence with &s;ome per&s;ons, who&s;e affections to the Whig-intere&s;t were &s;u&s;pected, yet was his name never called in que&s;tion. While he was in favour with the duke of Buckingham, the lords Bolingbroke, Oxford, and Harcourt, Dr. Swift, and Mr. Prior, he did not drop his corre&s;pondence with the lord Hallifax, Mr. Craggs, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were at the head of the Whig intere&s;t. A profe&s;&s;ed Jacobite one day remon&s;trated to Mr. Pope, that the people of his party took it ill that he &s;hould write with Mr. Steele upon ever &s;o in|different a &s;ubject; at which he could not help &s;miling, and ob&s;erved, that he hated narrowne&s;s of &s;oul in any party; and that if he renounced his rea&s;on in religious matters, he &s;hould hardly do it on any other, and that he could pray not only for oppo&s;ite parties, but even for oppo&s;ite re|ligions. Mr. Pope con&s;idered him&s;elf as a citizen of the world, and was therefore obliged to pray for the pro&s;perity of mankind in general. As a &s;on of Britain he wi&s;hed tho&s;e councils might be &s;uffered by providence to prevail, which were mo&s;t for the intere&s;t of his native country: But as politics was not his &s;tudy, he could not always determine, at lea&s;t, with any degree of certainty, who&s;e councils were be&s;t; and had charity enough to believe, that contending parties might mean well. As ta&s;te and &s;cience are confined to no
<PB N="236" REF="241">
country, &s;o ought they not to be excluded from any party, and Mr. Pope had an unexceptionable right to live upon terms of the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip with every man of parts, to which party &s;oever he might belong. Mr. Pope's uprightne&s;s in his conduct towards contending politicians, is demon|&s;trated by his living independent of either faction. He accepted no place, and had too high a &s;pirit to become a pen&s;ioner.</P>
<P>Many effects however were made to pro&s;elyte him from the Popi&s;h f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ith, which all proved inef|fectual. His friends conceived hopes from the moderation which he on all occa&s;ions expre&s;&s;ed, that he was really a Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tant in his heart, and that upon the death of his mother, he would not &s;cruple to declare his &s;entiments, notwith&s;tanding the reproaches he might incur from the Popi&s;h party, and the public ob&s;ervation it would draw up|on him. The bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter &s;trongly advi&s;ed him to read the controverted points between the Prote&s;tant and the Catholic church, to &s;uffer his unprejudiced rea&s;on to determine for him, and he made no doubt, but a &s;eparation from the Romi&s;h communion would &s;oon en&s;ue. To this Mr. Pope very candidly an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Whether the change would be to my &s;piritual advantage, God only knows: This I know, that I mean as well in the religion I now profe&s;s, as ever I can do in any other.

<P>'As to the temporal &s;ide of the que&s;tion, I can have no di&s;pute with you; it is certain, all the beneficial circum&s;tances of life, and all the &s;hin|ing ones, lie on the part you would invite me to.

<P>The&s;e are the peaceful maxims upon which we find Mr. Pope conducted his life, and if they cannot in &s;ome re&s;pects be ju&s;tified, yet it mu&s;t be owned, that his religion and his politics were well enough adapted for a poet, which entitled him to a kind of univer&s;al patronage, and to make every good man his friend.</P>
<P>Dean Swift &s;ometimes wrote to Mr. Pope on the topic of changing his religion, and once hu|morou&s;ly offered him twenty pounds for that pur|po&s;e. Mr. Pope's an&s;wer to this, lord Orrery has obliged the world by pre&s;erving in the life of Swift. It is a perfect ma&s;ter-piece of wit and plea&s;antry.</P>
<P>We have already taken notice, that Mr. Pope was called upon by the public voice to tran&s;late the Iliad, which he performed with &s;o much ap|plau&s;e, and at the &s;ame time, with &s;o much pro|fit to him&s;elf, that he was envied by many writ|ers, who&s;e vanity perhaps induced them to be|lieve them&s;elves equal to &s;o great a de&s;ign. A combination of inferior wits were employed to write The Popiad, in which his tran&s;lation is cha|racterized, as unju&s;t to the original, without beau|ty of language, or variety of numbers. In&s;tead of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the original, they &s;ay there is ab|&s;urdity
<PB N="239" REF="244">
and extravagance. In&s;tead of the beauti|ful language of the original, there is &s;oleci&s;m and barbarous Engli&s;h. A candid reader may ea&s;ily di&s;cern from this furious introduction, that the critics were actuated rather by malice than truth, and that they mu&s;t judge with their eyes &s;hut, who can &s;ee no beauty of language, no harmony of numbers in this tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t formidable critic again&s;t Mr. Pope in this great undertaking, was the celebrated Madam Dacier, whom Mr. Pope treated with le&s;s cere|mony in his Notes on the Iliad, than, in the opi|nion of &s;ome people, was due to her &s;ex. This learned lady was not without a &s;en&s;e of the in|jury, and took an opportunity of di&s;covering her re&s;entment.<Q REND="inline"><P>'Upon fini&s;hing (&s;ays &s;he) the &s;econd edition of my tran&s;lation of Homer, a particular friend &s;ent me a tran&s;lation of part of Mr. Pope's preface to his Ver&s;ion of the Iliad. As I do not under&s;tand Engli&s;h, I cannot form any judgment of his per|formance, though I have heard much of it. I am indeed willing to believe, that the prai&s;es it has met with are not unmerited, becau&s;e whatever work is approved by the Engli&s;h nation, cannot be bad; but yet I hope I may be permitted to judge of that part of the preface, which has been tran&s;mitted to me, and I here take the liberty of giving my &s;entiments concerning it. I mu&s;t free|ly acknowledge that Mr. Pope's invention is very lively, though he &s;eems to have been guilty of the &s;ame fault into which he owns we are often precipitated by our invention, when we depend too much upon the &s;trength of it; as magnanimity (&s;ays he) may run up to confu&s;ion and extrava|gance, &s;o may great invention to redundancy and wildne&s;s.</P>
<P>'This has been the very ca&s;e of Mr. Pope him|&s;elf; nothing is more over&s;trained, or more fal&s;e
<PB N="240" REF="245">
than the images in which his fancy has repre&s;ent|ed Homer; &s;ometimes he tells us, that the Iliad is a wild paradi&s;e, where, if we cannot &s;ee all the beauties, as in an ordered garden, it is only be|cau&s;e the number of them is infinitely greater. Sometimes he compares him to a copious nur&s;ery, which contains the &s;eeds and fir&s;t productions of every kind; and, la&s;tly, he repre&s;ents him under the notion of a mighty tree, which ri&s;es from the mo&s;t vigorous &s;eed, is improved with indu&s;try, flouri&s;hes and produces the fine&s;t fruit, but bears too many branches, which might be lopped into form, to give it a more regular appearance.</P>
<P>'What! is Homer's poem then, according to Mr. Pope, a confu&s;ed heap of beauties, without order or &s;ymmetry, and a plot whereon nothing but &s;eeds, nor nothing perfect or formed is to be found; and a production loaded with many un|profitable things which ought to be retrenched, and which choak and disfigure tho&s;e which de&s;erve to be pre&s;erved? Mr. Pope will pardon me if I here oppo&s;e tho&s;e compari&s;ons, which to me ap|pear very fal&s;e, and entirely contrary to what the greate&s;t of ancient, and modern critics ever thought.</P>
<P>'The Iliad is &s;o far from being a wild para|di&s;e, that it is the mo&s;t regular garden, and laid out with more &s;ymmetry than any ever was. Eve|ry thing therein is not only in the place it ought to have been, but every thing is fitted for the place it hath. He pre&s;ents you at fir&s;t with that which ought to be fir&s;t &s;een; he places in the middle what ought to be in the middle, and what would be improperly placed at the beginning or end, and he removes what ought to be at a greater di&s;tance, to create the more agreeable &s;urprize; and, to u&s;e a compari&s;on drawn from painting, he places that in the greate&s;t light which cannot be too vi&s;ible, and &s;inks in the ob&s;curity of the &s;hade, what does
<PB N="241" REF="246">
not require a full view; &s;o that it may be &s;aid, that Homer is the Painter who be&s;t knew how to em|ploy the &s;hades and lights. The &s;econd compari|&s;on is equally unju&s;t; how could Mr. Pope &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that one can only di&s;cover &s;eeds, and the fir&s;t productions of every kind in the Iliad?'</Q> every beauty is there to &s;uch an amazing perfection, that the following ages could add nothing to tho&s;e of any kind; and the ancients have always propo&s;ed Homer, as the mo&s;t perfect model in every kind of poetry.</P>
<P>'The third compari&s;on is compo&s;ed of the er|rors of the two former; Homer had certainly an incomparable fertility of invention, but his ferti|lity is always checked by that ju&s;t &s;en&s;e, which made him reject every &s;uperfluous thing which his va&s;t imagination could offer, and to retain only what was nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful. Judgment guided the hand of this admirable gardener, and was the pruning hook he employed to lop off every u&s;ele&s;s branch.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus far Madam Dacier differs in her opinion from Mr. Pope concerning Homer; but the&s;e re|marks which we have ju&s;t quoted, partake not at all of the nature of critici&s;m; they are meer a&s;|&s;ertion. Pope had declared Homer to abound with irregular beauties. Dacier has contradicted him, and a&s;&s;erted, that all his beauties are regular, but no rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned by either of the&s;e mighty ge|niu&s;es in &s;upport of their opinions, and the reader is left in the dark, as to the real truth. If he is to be guided by the authority of a name only, no doubt the argument will preponderate in favour of our countryman. The French lady then proceeds to an&s;wer &s;ome ob&s;ervations, which Mr. Pope made upon her Remarks on the Iliad, which &s;he per|forms with a warmth that generally attends writ|ers of her &s;ex. Mr. Pope, however, paid more regard to this fair antagoni&s;t, than any other cri|tic
<PB N="242" REF="247">
upon his works. He confe&s;&s;ed that he had re|ceived great helps from her, and only thought &s;he had (through a prodigious, and almo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious, fondne&s;s for Homer) endeavoured to make him ap|pear without any fault, or weakne&s;s, and &s;tamp a perfection on his works, which is no where to be found. He wrote her a very obliging letter, in which he conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed him&s;elf exceedingly &s;orry that he ever &s;hould have di&s;plea&s;ed &s;o excellent a wit, and &s;he, on the other hand, with a goodne&s;s and frankne&s;s prculiar to her, prote&s;ted to forgive it, &s;o that there remained no animo&s;ities between tho&s;e two great admirers and tran&s;lators of Homer.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope, by his &s;ucce&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ful tran&s;lation of the Iliad, as we have before remarked, drew upon him the envy and raillery of a whole tribe of writers. Though he did not e&s;teem any particular man a|mong&s;t his enemies of con&s;equence enough to pro|voke an an&s;wer, yet when they were con&s;idered collectively, they offered excellent materials for a general &s;atire. This &s;atire he planned and exe|cuted with &s;o extraordinary a ma&s;tery, that it is by far the mo&s;t compleat poem of our author's; it di&s;covers more invention, and a higher effort of genius, toan any other production of his. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">int was taken from Mr. Dryden's Mac <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lecknoe, but as it is more general, &s;o it is more plea&s;ing. The Dunciad is &s;o univer&s;ally read, that we rec|kon it &s;uperfiuous to give any further account of it here; and it would be an unplea&s;ing ta&s;k to trace all the provocations and re&s;entments, which were mutually di&s;covered upon this occa&s;ion. Mr. Pope was of opinion, that next to prai&s;ing good writers, there was a merit in expo&s;ing bad ones, though it does not hold infallibly true, that each per&s;on &s;tig|matized as a dunce, was genuinely &s;o. Something mu&s;t be allowed to per&s;onal re&s;entment; Mr. Pope was a man of keen pa&s;&s;ions; he felt an injury &s;trongly, retained a long remembrance of it, and
<PB N="243" REF="248">
could very pungently repay it. Some of the gen|tlemen, however, who had been more &s;everely la&s;hed than the re&s;t, meditated a revenge, which redounds but little to their honour. They either in|tended to cha&s;tize him corporally, or gave it out that they had really done &s;o, in order to bring &s;hame upon Mr. Pope, which, if true, could only bring &s;hame upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>While Mr. Pope enjoyed any lei&s;ure from &s;everer applications to &s;tudy, his friends were continually &s;olliciting him to turn his thoughts towards &s;ome|thing that might be of la&s;ting u&s;e to the world, and engage no more in a war with dunces who were now effectually humbled. Our great dramatic poet Shake&s;pear had pa&s;s'd through &s;everal hands, &s;ome of whom were very rea&s;onably judged not to have under&s;tood any part of him tolerably, much le&s;s were capable to correct or revi&s;e him.</P>
<P>The friends of Mr. Pope therefore &s;trongly im|portuned him, to undertake the whole of Shake|&s;pear's plays, and, if po&s;&s;ible, by comparing all the different copies now to be procured, re&s;tore him to his ancient purity. To which our poet made this mode&s;t reply, that not having attempted any thing in the Drama, it might in him be deemed too much pre&s;umption. To which he was an&s;wered, that this did not require great knowledge of the foun|dation and di&s;po&s;ition of the drama, as that mu&s;t &s;tand as it was, and Skake&s;pear him&s;elf had not always paid &s;trict regard to the rules of it; but this was to clear the &s;cenes from the rubbi&s;h with which ignorant editors had filled them.</P>
<P>His proper bu&s;ine&s;s in this work was to render the text &s;o clear as to be generally under&s;tood, to free it from ob&s;curities, and &s;ometimes gro&s;s ab&s;urdities, which now &s;eem to appear in it, and to explain doubtful and difficult pa&s;&s;ages of which there are great numbers. This however was an arduous pro|vince, and how Mr. Pope has acquitted him&s;elf
<PB N="244" REF="249">
in it has been differently determined: It is certain he never valued him&s;elf upon that performance, nor was it a ta&s;k in the lea&s;t adapted to his genius; for it &s;eldom happens that a man of lively parts can undergo the &s;ervile drudgery of collecting pa&s;&s;ages, in which more indu&s;try and labour are nece&s;&s;ary than per&s;ons of quick penetration generally have to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>It has been the opinion of &s;ome critics, that Mr. Pope's talents were not adapted for the drama, otherwi&s;e we cannot well account for his neglecting the mo&s;t gainful way of writing which poetry affords, e&s;pecially as his reputation was &s;o high, that with|out much ceremony or mortification, he might have had any piece of his brought upon the &s;tage. Mr. Pope was attentive to his own intere&s;t, and if he had not either been con&s;cious of his inability in that province, or too timid to wi&s;h the popular ap|probation, he would certainly have attempted the drama. Neither was he e&s;teemed a very competent judge of what plays were proper or improper for repre&s;entation. He wrote &s;everal letters to the ma|nager of Drury-Lane Theatre, in favour of Thom|&s;on's Agamemnon, which notwith&s;tanding his ap|probation, Thom&s;on's friends were obliged to mu|tulate and &s;horten; and after all it proved a heavy play.&mdash;Though it was generally allowed to have been one of the be&s;t acted plays that had appeared for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>He was certainly concerned in the Comedy, which was publi&s;hed in Mr. Gay's name, called Three Hours after Marriage, as well as Dr. Arbuth|not. This illu&s;trious triumvirate, though men of the mo&s;t various parts, and exten&s;ive under&s;tanding, yet were not able it &s;eems to plea&s;e the people, tho' the principal parts were &s;upported by the be&s;t actors in that way on the &s;tage. Dr. Arbuthnot and Mr Pope were no doubt &s;olicitous to conceal their concern in it; but by a letter which Gay wrote to Pope, pub|li&s;hed

<P>Of all our poet's writings none were read with more general approbation than his Ethic Epi&s;tles, or multiplied into more editions. Mr. Pope who was a perfect oeconomi&s;t, &s;ecured to him&s;elf the profits ari&s;ing from his own works; he was never &s;ubjected to nece&s;&s;ity, and therefore was not to be impo&s;ed upon by the art or fraud of publi&s;hers.</P>

<P><PB N="246" REF="251">
Mr. Pope who had been always &s;ubjected to a variety of bodily infirmities, finding his &s;trength give way, began to think that his days, which had been prolonged pa&s;t his expectation, were draw|ing towards a conclu&s;ion. However, he vi&s;ited the Hot-Wells at Bri&s;tol, where for &s;ome time there were &s;mall hopes of his recovery; but making too free with purges he grew wor&s;e, and &s;eemed de&s;irous to draw nearer home. A drop&s;y in the brea&s;t at la&s;t put a period to his life, at the age of 56, on the 30th of May 1744, at his hou&s;e at Twickenham, where he was interred in the &s;ame grave with his father and mother.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope's behaviour in his la&s;t illne&s;s has been variou&s;ly repre&s;ented to the world: Some have affirmed that it was timid and peevi&s;h; that having been fixed in no particular &s;y&s;tem of faith, his mind was wavering, and his temper broken and di&s;turb'd. Others have a&s;&s;erted that he was all chearfulne&s;s and re&s;ignation to the divine will: Which of the&s;e opinions is true we cannot now determine; but if the former, it mu&s;t be regretted, that he, who had taught philo&s;ophy to others, &s;hould him&s;elf be de&s;ti|tute of its a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the mo&s;t critical moments of his life.</P>
<P>The bulk of his fortune he bequeath'd to Mrs. Blount, with whom he lived in the &s;tricte&s;t friend|&s;hip, and for whom he is &s;aid to have entertained the warme&s;t affection. His works, which are in the hands of every per&s;on of true ta&s;te, and will la&s;t as long as our language will be under&s;tood, render unnece&s;&s;ary all further remarks on his writings. He was equally admired for the dignity and &s;ubli|mity of his moral and philo&s;ophical works, the vivacity of his &s;atirical, the clearne&s;s and propriety of his didactic, the richne&s;s and variety of his di|&s;criptive, and the elegance of all, added to an harmony of ver&s;ification and correctne&s;s of &s;enti|ment and language, unknown to our former poets,
<PB N="247" REF="252">
and of which he has &s;et an example which will be an example or a reproach to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. His pro&s;e-&s;tile is as perfect in its kind as his poetic, and has all the beauties proper for it, joined to an un|common force and per&s;picuity.</P>
<P>Under the profe&s;&s;ion of the Roman-Catholic re|ligion, to which he adhered to the la&s;t, he main|tained all the moderation and charity becoming the mo&s;t thorough and con&s;i&s;tent Prote&s;tant. His conver&s;ation was natural, ea&s;y and agreeable, with|out any affectation of di&s;playing his wit, or ob|truding his own judgment, even upon &s;ubjects of which he was &s;o eminently a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The moral character of our author, as it did not e&s;cape the la&s;h of his calumniators in his life; &s;o have there been attempts &s;ince his death to dimini&s;h his reputation. Lord Bolingbroke, whom Mr. Pope e&s;teemed to almo&s;t an enthu&s;ia&s;tic degree of admira|tion, was the fir&s;t to make this attack. Not many years ago, the public were entertained with this controver&s;y immediately upon the publication of his lord&s;hip's Letters on the Spirit of Patrioti&s;m, and the Idea of a Patriot King. Different opinions have been offered, &s;ome to extenuate the fault of Mr. Pope, for printing and mutilating the&s;e letters without his lord&s;hip's knowledge; others to blame him for it as the highe&s;t breach of friend&s;hip, and the greate&s;t mark of di&s;honour. It would exceed our propo&s;ed bounds to enter into the merits of this controver&s;y; the reader, no doubt, will find it am|ply di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in that account of the life of this great author, which Mr. Warburton has promi&s;ed the public.</P>
<P>This great man is allowed to have been one of the fir&s;t rank among&s;t the poets of our nation, and to ac|knowledge the &s;uperiority of none but Shake&s;pear, Milton, and Dryden. With the two former, it is unnatural to compare him, as their province in writ|ing is &s;o very different. Pope has never attempted
<PB N="248" REF="253">
the drama, nor publi&s;hed an Epic Poem, in which the&s;e two di&s;tingui&s;hed genius's have &s;o wonder|fully &s;ucceeded. Though Pope's genius was great, it was yet of &s;o different a ca&s;t from Shake&s;pear's, and Milton's, that no compari&s;on can be ju&s;tly formed. But if this may be &s;aid of the former two, it will by no means hold with re&s;pect to the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ter, for between him and Dryden, there is a great &s;imilarity of writing, and a very &s;triking coin|cidence of genius. It will not perhaps be un|plea&s;ing to our readers, if we pur&s;ue this compari&s;on, and endeavour to di&s;cover to whom the &s;uperiority is ju&s;tly to be attributed, and to which of them poe|try owes the highe&s;t obligations.</P>
<P>When Dryden came into the world, he found poetry in a very imperfect &s;tate; its numbers were unpoli&s;hed; its cadences rough, and there was no|thing of harmony or mellifluence to give it a grace|ful of flow. In this har&s;h, unmu&s;ical &s;ituation, Dryden found it (for the refinements of Waller were but puerile and un&s;ub&s;tantial) he poli&s;hed the rough diamond, he taught it to &s;hine, and connect|ed beauty, elegance, and &s;trength, in all his poeti|cal compo&s;itions. Though Dryden thus poli&s;hed our Engli&s;h numbers, and thus harmonized ver&s;ifi|cation, it cannot be &s;aid, that he carried his art to perfection. Much was yet left undone; his lines with all their &s;moothne&s;s were often rambling, and ex|pletives were frequently introduced to compleat his mea&s;ures. It was apparent therefore that an ad|ditional harmony might &s;till be given to our num|bers, and that cadences were yet capable of a more mu&s;ical modulation. To effect this purpo&s;e Mr. Pope aro&s;e, who with an ear elegantly delicate, and the advantage of the fine&s;t genius, &s;o har|monized the Engli&s;h numbers, as to make them compleatly mu&s;ical. His numbers are likewi&s;e &s;o minutely correct, that it would be difficult to conceive how any of his lines can be altered
<PB N="249" REF="254">
to advantage. He has created a kind of me|chanical ver&s;ification; every line is alike; and though they are &s;weetly mu&s;ical, they want diver|&s;ity, for he has not &s;tudied &s;o great a variety of pau&s;es, and where the accents may be laid grace|fully. The &s;tructure of his ver&s;e is the be&s;t, and a line of his is more mu&s;ical than any other line can be made, by placing the accents el&s;ewhere; but we are not quite certain, whether the ear is not apt to be &s;oon cloy'd with this uniformity of elegance, this &s;amene&s;s of harmony. It mu&s;t be acknowledged however, that he has much improved upon Dryden in the article of ver&s;ification, and in that part of poetry is greatly his &s;uperior. But though this mu&s;t be acknowledged, perhaps it will not nece&s;|&s;arily follow that his genius was therefore &s;uperior.</P>
<P>The grand characteri&s;tic of a poet is his inven|tion, the &s;ure&s;t di&s;tinction of a great genius. In Mr. Pope, nothing is &s;o truly original as his Rape of the Lock, nor di&s;covers &s;o much invention. In this kind of mock-heroic, he is without a rival in our language, for Dryden has written nothing of the kind. His other work which di&s;covers in|vention, fine de&s;igning, and admirable execution, is his Dunciad; which, tho' built on Dryden's Mac Flecknoe, is yet &s;o much &s;uperior, that in &s;atiric writing, the Palm mu&s;t ju&s;tly be yielded to him. In Mr. Dryden's Ab&s;alom and Achitophel, there are indeed the mo&s;t poignant &s;trokes of &s;atire, and characters drawn with the mo&s;t ma&s;terly touches; but this poem with all its excellencies is much in|ferior to the Dunciad, though Dryden had advan|tages which Mr. Pope had not; for Dryden's cha|racters are men of great eminence and figure in the &s;tate, while Pope has to expo&s;e men of ob&s;cure birth and unimportant lives only di&s;tingui&s;hed from the herd of mankind, by a glimmering of genius, which rendered the greate&s;t part of them more em|phatically contemptible. Pope's was the harde&s;t
<PB N="250" REF="255">
ta&s;k, and he has executed it with the greate&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s. As Mr. Dryden mu&s;t undoubtedly have yielded to Pope in &s;atyric writing, it is incumbent on the partizans of Dryden to name a other &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, in which the former excells &s;o as to throw the ballance again upon the &s;ide of Dryden. This &s;pecies is the Lyric, in which the warme&s;t vo|taries of Pope mu&s;t certainly acknowledge, that he is much inferior; as an irre&s;i&s;table proof of this we need only compare Mr. Dryden's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day, with Mr. Pope's; in which the cupa&s;ity is &s;o apparent, that we know not if the mo&s;t fini&s;hed of Pope's compo&s;itions has di&s;covered &s;uch a variety and command of numbers.</P>
<P>It hath been generally acknowledged, that the Lyric is a more excellent kind of writing than the Satiric; and con&s;equently he who excells in the mo&s;t excellent &s;pecies, mu&s;t undoubtedly be e&s;teemed the greate&s;t poet.&mdash;Mr. Pope has very happily &s;ucceeded in many of his occa&s;ional pieces. &s;uch as Eloi&s;a to Abelard, his Elegy on an unfortunate young Lady, and a variety of other performances de&s;ervedly celebrated. To the&s;e may be oppo&s;ed Mr. Dryden's Fables, which though written in a very advanced age, are yet the mo&s;t perfect of his works. In the&s;e Fables there is per|haps a greater variety than in Pope's occa&s;ional pieces: Many of them indeed are tran&s;lations, but &s;uch as are original &s;hew a great extent of invention, and a large compa&s;s of genius.</P>
<P>There are not in Pope's works &s;uch poignant di&s;coveries of wit, or &s;uch a general knowledge of the humours and characters of men, as in the Prologues and Epilogues of Dryden, which are the be&s;t records of the whims and capriclous oddities of the times in which they are written.</P>
<P>When the&s;e two great genius's are con&s;idered in the light of tran&s;lators, it will indeed be difficult to determine into who&s;e &s;cale the ballance &s;hould
<PB N="251" REF="256">
be thrown: That Mr. Pope had a more arduous province in doing ju&s;tice to Homer, than Dryden with regard to Virgil is certainly true; as Homer is a more various and diffu&s;e poet than Virgil; and it is likewi&s;e true, that Pope has even ex|ceeded Dryden in the execution, and none will deny, that Pope's Homer's Iliad, is a finer poem than Dryden's Aeneis of Virgil: Making a proper allowance for the di&s;proportion of the ori|ginal authors. But then a candid critic &s;hould re|flect, that as Dryden was prior in the great attempt of tendering Virgil into Engli&s;h; &s;o did he per|form the ta&s;k under many di&s;advantages, which Pope, by a happier &s;ituation in life, was enabled to avoid; and could not but improve upon Dryden's errors, though the authors tran&s;lated were not the &s;ame: And it is much to be doubted, if Dryden were to tran&s;late the Aeneid now, with that at|tention which the correctne&s;s of the pre&s;ent age would force upon him, whether the preference would be due to Pope's Homer.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing it to be yielded (as it certainly mu&s;t) that the latter bard was the greate&s;t tran|&s;lator; we are now to throw into Mr. Dryden's &s;cale all his dramatic works; which though not the mo&s;t excellent of his writings, yet as nothing of Mr. Pope's can be oppo&s;ed to them, they have an undoubted right to turn the ballance greatly in favour of Mr. Dryden.&mdash;When the two poets are con&s;idered as critics, the compari&s;on will very im|perfectly hold. Dryden's Dedications and Prefaces, be&s;ides that they are more numerous, and are the be&s;t models for courtly panegyric, &s;hew that he under|&s;tood poetry as an art, beyond any man that ever lived. And he explained this art &s;o well, that he taught his antagoni&s;ts to turn the tables again&s;t him|&s;elf; for he &s;o illuminaced the mind by his clear and per&s;picuous rea&s;oning, that dullne&s;s it&s;elf be|came capable of di&s;cerning; and when at any
<PB N="252" REF="257">
time his performances fell &s;hort of his own ideas of excellence; his enemies tried him by rules of his own e&s;tabli&s;hing; and though they owed to him the ability of judging, they &s;eldom had candour enough to &s;pare him.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be true that Pope's works are read with more appetite, as there is a greater evenne&s;s and correctne&s;s in them; but in peru&s;ing the works of Dryden the mind will take a wider range, and be more fraught with poetical ideas: We admire Dryden as the greater genius, and Pope as the mo&s;t plea&s;ing ver&s;ifier.</P>

At nine years old &s;he put
<PB N="253" REF="258">
him to &s;chool to Mr. Rayner at Barn&s;table in De|von&s;hire, from whence, he went to We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool; where &s;oon (under the care of Dr. Knipe) his genius &s;hewed it&s;elf in a di&s;tingui&s;hed light, and often made him &s;ome amends for his hard for|tune, which denied him &s;uch &s;upplies of pocket|money as his &s;pirit wi&s;hed, by enabling him to perform the ta&s;ks of many who had not his capacity.</P>
<P>Mr. Aaron Hill, was born in Beaufort-Buildings in the Strand, on February 10, 1684-5. At fourteen years of age he left We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool; and, &s;hortly after, hearing his grandmother make mention of a re|lation much e&s;teemed (lord Paget, then amba&s;&s;ador at Con&s;tantinople) he formed a re&s;olution of pay|ing him a vi&s;it there, being likewi&s;e very de&s;irous to &s;ee that empire.</P>
<P>His grandmother being a woman of uncommon under&s;tanding, and great good-nature, would not oppo&s;e him in it; and accordingly he &s;oon em|bark'd on board a &s;hip, then going there, March 2, 1700, as appears by a Journal which he kept during his voyage, and in his travels (though at &s;o weak an age) wherein he gave the mo&s;t accu|rate account of every particular, in a manner much above his years.</P>
<P>When he arrived, lord Paget received him with as much &s;urprize, as plea&s;ure, wondering that &s;o young a per&s;on as he was (but then in his fifteenth year) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">uld chu&s;e to run the hazard of &s;uch a voyage to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> a relation, whom he knew but by character. The amba&s;&s;ador immediately provided for him a very learned eccle&s;ia&s;tic in his own hou&s;e, and, un|der his tuition, &s;ent him to travel, being de&s;irous to improve, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the education of a per&s;on he found worthy of it. With this tutor he had the opportunity of &s;eeing Egypt, Pale&s;tine, and a great part of the Ea&s;tern country.</P>
<P>With lord Paget he returned home, about the year 1703, through great part of Europe; in which tour he &s;aw mo&s;t of the courts.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="259">
He was in great e&s;teem with that nobleman; in|&s;omuch, that in all probability he had been &s;till more di&s;tingui&s;hed by him at his death, than in his life time, had not the envious fears and malice of a certain female, who was in high authority and favour with that lord, prevented and &s;upplanted his kind di&s;po&s;ition towards him: My lord took great plea&s;ure in in&s;tructing him him&s;elf, wrote him whole books in different languages, on which his &s;tudent placed the greate&s;t value; which was no &s;ooner taken notice of by jealous ob&s;ervation, than they were &s;tolen from his apartment, and &s;uffered to be &s;ome days mi&s;|&s;ing, to the great di&s;plea&s;ure of my lord, but &s;till much greater affliction of his pupil, who&s;e grief for lo&s;ing a trea&s;ure he &s;o highly valued, was more than doubled, by perceiving that from &s;ome fal&s;e in&s;inuation that had been made, it was believed he had him&s;elf wilfully lo&s;t them: But young Mr. Hill was &s;oon entirely cleared on this head.</P>
<P>A few years after, he was de&s;ired both on ac|count of his &s;obriety and under&s;tanding, to accom|pany Sir William Wentworth, a worthy baronet of York&s;hire, who was then going to make the tour of Europe; with whom he travelled two or three years, and brought him home improved, to the &s;atisfaction of that gentleman's relations.</P>
<P>'Twas in tho&s;e different travels he collected mat|ter for the hi&s;tory he wrote of Turky, and pub|li&s;hed in 1709; a work he afterwards often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">|pented having printed; and (though his o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">) would critici&s;e upon it with much &s;everity. (But, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay, he was a very boy when he began and ended it; therefore great allowance may be made on that account); and in a letter which has &s;ince been printed in his works, wrote to his greatly valued friend, the worthy author of Cla|ri&s;&s;a, he acknowledges his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch defects: where &s;peaking of ob&s;curity, he &s;ays,</P>

<P>The fire of youth, with an imagination lively as his was, &s;eldom, if ever, go hand in hand with &s;olid judgment. Mr. Hill did not give him&s;elf in|deed time for correction, having wrote it &s;o very expeditiou&s;ly, as hardly would be credited. But (as Dr. Sprat, then bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, u&s;ed to ob&s;erve) there is certainly vi&s;ible in that book, the &s;eeds of a great writer.&mdash;He &s;eldom in his riper years was guilty of the fault of non-correction; for he revis'd, too &s;trictly rather, every piece he pur|po&s;ed for the public eye (exclu&s;ive of an author's natural fondne&s;s); and it has been believed by many, who have read &s;ome of his pieces in the fir&s;t copy, that had they never been by a revi&s;al deepned into greater &s;trength, they would have plea&s;ed &s;till more, at lea&s;t more generally.</P>
<P>About the year 1709 he publi&s;hed his fir&s;t poem, called Camillus; in vindication, and honour of the earl of Peterborough, who had been general in Spain. After that nobleman had &s;een it, he was de&s;irous to know who was the author of it; which having found by enquiry, he complimented him by making him his &s;ecretary, in the room of Mr. Furly, who was gon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> abroad with another nobleman: And Mr. Hill was always held in high e&s;teem with that great peer; with whom, however, he did not continue long; for in the year 1710 he married the only daughter of Edmund Morris, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Stratford, in E&s;&s;ex; with whom he had a very hand&s;ome for|tune: By her he had nine children, four of whom (a &s;on, and three daughters) are &s;till living.</P>
<P>In 1709 he was made ma&s;ter of the Theatre in Drury-Lane; and then, at the de&s;ire of Mr. Barton Booth, wrote his fir&s;t Tragedy, (Elfrid, or the Fair
<PB N="256" REF="261">
Incon&s;tant) which from his fir&s;t beginning of it he compleated in a little more than a week.&mdash;The following year, 1710, he was ma&s;ter of the Opera Hou&s;e in the Hay-Market; and then wrote an Opera called Rinaldo, which met with great &s;uc|ce&s;s: It was the fir&s;t which that admirable genius Mr. Handel compos'd, after he came to England; (this he dedicated to Queen Anne).&mdash;His genius was adapted greatly to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tage; and while he held the management, he conducted both Theatres, intirely to the &s;atisfaction of the pub|lic.&mdash;But in a few months he relinqui&s;hed it, from &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding with the then lord chamber|lain; and though he was &s;oon after &s;ollicited to take that charge again upon him (by a per&s;on the high|e&s;t in command) he &s;till declined it.</P>
<P>From that time he bent his thoughts on &s;tudies far more &s;olid and de&s;irable to him; to views of public benefit: For his mind was ardently devoted to the pur&s;uit of general improvement. But, as one genius &s;eldom is adapted to both theory and practice; &s;o in the execution of a variety of under|takings, the mo&s;t advantageous in them&s;elves, by &s;ome mi&s;management of tho&s;e concerned with him, he fail'd of the &s;ucce&s;s his labours merited.</P>
<P>As in particular, in an affair he &s;et on foot about the year 1715, and was the &s;ole di&s;coverer of, for which he had a patent; the making of an Oil, as &s;weet as that from Olives, from the Beech-Nuts: But this being an undertaking of a great extent, he was obliged to work conjointly with other men's a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and materials; whence aro&s;e di&s;putes among them, which terminated in the overthrowing the advantage then ari&s;ing from it; which otherwi&s;e might have been great and la&s;ting.</P>
<P>This, has occa&s;ioned that affair to be mi&s;under|&s;tood by many; it therefore may not be thought improper, here, to &s;et it in a ju&s;ter light; and this cannot more exactly be given, than from his own

<DIV1 TYPE="extract">
<P>'An impartial &s;tate of the ca&s;e, between the patentee, annuitants, and &s;harers, in the Beech-Oil-Company.'&mdash;Some part of which is here recited.</P>
<P>'The di&s;appointments of the Beech-Oil-Com|pany this year have made abundance of &s;harers peevi&s;h; the natural effect of peevi&s;hne&s;s is clamour, and clamour like a tide will work it&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age, where it has no right of flowing; &s;ome gentlemen, mi&s;led by fal&s;e conceptions both of the affair and its direction, have driven their di&s;content through a mi&s;taken chanel, and inclined abundance who are &s;trangers to the truth, to accu&s;e the patentee of faults, he is not only ab&s;olutely free from, but by which he is, of all concern'd, the greate&s;t &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>'But, he is not angry with the angry; he con|&s;iders they mu&s;t take things as they hear them re|pre&s;ented; he governs all his actions by this gene|ral maxim; never to be moved at a reproach, un|le&s;s it be a ju&s;t one.</P>
<P>'In October 1713 the patentee procured a grant for fourteen years, to him and his a&s;&s;igns, for the Beech-Oil invention.</P>
<P>'Anno 1714, he made and publi&s;hed propo&s;als, for taking a &s;ub&s;cription of 20,000 l. upon the fol|lowing conditions;</P>
<P>'That every &s;ub&s;criber &s;hould receive, by half yearly payments, at Lady-Day and Michaelmas, during the continuance of the patent from Lady-Day 1715, inclu&s;ive, an annuity amounting to fifty-pound per cent. for any &s;um &s;ub&s;cribed, ex|cepting a deduction for the payment of the directors.</P>
<P>'That nine directors &s;hould be cho&s;en on mid|&s;ummer-day, who &s;hould receive complaints upon non-payments of annuities; and in &s;uch ca&s;e, upon refu&s;al, any five of the nine directors had power to meet and chu&s;e a governor from among them&s;elves, enrolling that choice in chancery, together with the rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="263">
'That after &s;uch choice and enrollment, the pa|tentee &s;hould &s;tand ab&s;olutely excluded, the bu&s;ine&s;s be carried on, and all the right of the grant be ve&s;ted (not as a mortgage, but as a &s;ale without re|demption) in the governor &s;o cho&s;en, for the joint advantage of the annuitants, in proportion to their &s;everal intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>'As a &s;ecurity for making good the articles, the patentee did, by indenture enrolled in chancery, a&s;&s;ign and make over his patent to tru&s;tees, in the indenture named, for the u&s;es above mentioned.</P>
<P>'In the mean time the fir&s;t half yearly payments to the annuitants, amounting to 3750 l. became due, and the company not being yet compleated, the patentee him&s;elf di&s;charged it, and has never reckon'd that &s;um to the account between him and the company; which he might have done by vir|tue of the articles on which he gave admi&s;&s;ion to the &s;harers.</P>
<P>'For the better explanation of this &s;cheme it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that while the &s;hares were &s;elling, he grew apprehen&s;ive that the &s;ea&s;on would be pa&s;t, before the fifty pounds per &s;hare they were to furni&s;h by the articles could be contributed: He therefore gave up voluntarily, and for the general good, 20,000 l. of his own 25,000 guineas pur|cha&s;e money, as a loan to the company till the ex|piration of the patent, after which it was again to be made good to him, or his a&s;&s;igns; and this mo|ney &s;o lent by the patentee, is all the &s;tock that ever has been hitherto employed by the company.</P>
<P>'But in&s;tead of making good the above-men|tioned conditional covenant, the board proceeded to unnece&s;&s;ary warmth, and &s;ound them&s;elves in|volved &s;till more and more in animo&s;ities, and tho&s;e irregularities which naturally follow groundle&s;s controver&s;y. He would therefore take upon him|&s;elf the hazard and the power of the whole affair, accountable however to the board, as to the money
<PB N="259" REF="264">
part; and yet would bind him&s;elf to pay for three years to come, a profit of forty &s;hillings per annum upon every &s;hare, and then deliver back the bu&s;ine&s;s to the general care, above the reach of future di&s;|appointments.</P>
<P>'What rea&s;ons the gentlemen might have to re|fu&s;e &s;o inviting an offer is be&s;t known to them&s;elves; but they ab&s;olutely rejected that part of it, which was to fix the &s;ole power of management in the pa|tentee. Upon which, and many other provocations afterward, becoming more and more di&s;&s;atisfied, he thought &s;it to demand repayment of five hun|dred pounds, which he had lent the company; as he had &s;everal other &s;ums before; and not receiving it, but, on the contrary, being denied &s;o much as an acknowledgment that it was due, withdrew him|&s;elf intirely from the board, and left them to their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>'Thus at the &s;ame time have I offered my de|fence, and my opinion: By the fir&s;t I am &s;ure I &s;hall be acquitted from all imputations; and con|firmed in the good thoughts of the concerned on either &s;ide, who will know for the future what at|tention they &s;hould give to idle reflections, and the fal&s;ehood of rumour; and from the la&s;t, I have hopes that a plan may be drawn, which will &s;ettle at once all di&s;puted preten&s;ions, and re&s;tore that fair pro&s;pect, which the open advantage of la&s;t year's &s;ucce&s;s (indifferent as it was) has demon&s;trated to be a view that was no way chimerical.&mdash;</P>
<P>'They know how to judge of malicious in&s;inua|tions to my prejudice, by this <HI>one mo&s;t &s;candalous ex|ample,</HI> which has been given by the endeavours of &s;ome to per&s;uade the out-&s;harers that I have made an extravagant <HI>profit</HI> from the <HI>lo&s;&s;es</HI> of the adventur|ers. Whereas on the contrary, out of <HI>Twenty-five Thou&s;and Guineas,</HI> which was the whole I &s;hould have received by the &s;ale of the &s;hares, I have given up <HI>Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> to the u&s;e of the com|pany,
<PB N="260" REF="265">
and to the annuities afterward; and three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty pounds more I paid to the annuitants, at Lady-Day 1715, on the company's account; and have never demanded it again, in con&s;ideration of their di&s;appointments the fir&s;t year.</P>
<P>'So that it plainly appears, that out of twenty|five thou&s;and guineas, I have given away in two articles only, twenty-three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty pounds for the public advantage. And I can ea&s;ily prove, that the little remainder has been &s;hort of making good the charges I have been at for their &s;ervice; by which means I am not one farthing a gainer by the company, notwith&s;tanding the clamour and malice of &s;ome unthinking adven|turers: And for the truth of all this, I appeal to their own <HI>Office-Books,</HI> and defy the mo&s;t angry a|mong them to deny any article of it. See then what a grateful and generous encouragement may be expected by men, who would dedicate their labours to the profit of others.</P>

<P>This, and much more, too tedious to in&s;ert, &s;erves to demon&s;trate that it was a great misfortune, for a mind &s;o fertile of invention and improvement, to be embarra&s;&s;ed by a narrow power of fortune; too weak alone to execute &s;uch undertakings.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame year he wrote another Tragedy, intiled the Fatal Vi&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This play he made a pre&s;ent of to the patentee, and had &s;e|veral fine &s;cenes painted for it, at his own expence: He indeed gave all his pieces to the &s;tage; never taking any benefit, or gratuity from the managers, as an author&mdash;'till his la&s;t piece, Merope, was brought on the &s;tage; when (unhappy gentleman) he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving his profits of the third nights; which 'till then, his genero&s;ity, and &s;pirit, had ever declined.</NOTE>, or the Fall of Siam (which was acted the &s;ame year, in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields) to which he gave this Motto out of Horace.<Q><PB N="261" REF="266">
<L>I not for vulgar admiration write;</L>
<L>To be well read, not much, is my delight.</L></Q></P>
<P>And to his death he would declare in favour of that choice.&mdash;That year, he likewi&s;e publi&s;hed the two fir&s;t books of an Epic Poem, called Gideon (founded on a Hebrew Story) which like its author, and all other authors, had its enemies; but many more admirers.</P>
<P>But his poetic pieces were not frequent in their ap|pearance. They were the product of &s;ome lei&s;ure hours, when he relaxed his thoughts from drier &s;tudy; as he took great delight in diving into every u&s;eful &s;cience, viz. critici&s;m, hi&s;tory, geography, phy&s;ic, commerce in general, agriculture, war, and law; but in particular natural philo&s;ophy, wherein he has made many and valuable di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>Concerning poetry, he &s;ays, in his preface to King Henry the Vth, where he laments the want of ta&s;te for Tragedy,<Q REND="inline"><P>'But in all events I will be ea&s;y, who have no better rea&s;on to wi&s;h well to poetry, than my love for a mi&s;tre&s;s I &s;hall never be married to: For, whenever I grow ambitious, I &s;hall wi&s;h to build higher; and owe my memory to &s;ome occa&s;ion of more importance than my writings.'</P></Q></P>
<P>He had acquired &s;o deep an in&s;ight in law, that he has from his arguments and demon&s;trations obliged &s;ome of the greate&s;t council (formally) un|der their hands, to retract their own fir&s;t-given opinions.</P>
<P>He wrote part of a Tract of War; another up|on Agriculture; but they are left unfini&s;hed, with &s;everal other pieces.</P>
<P>In his younger days he bought a grant of Sir Robert Montgomery (who had purchas'd it of the lords proprietors of Carolina) with whom, &amp;c. he had been concern'd, in a de&s;ign of &s;ettling a new
<PB N="262" REF="267">
plantation in the South of Carolina, of a va&s;t tract of land; on which he then de&s;igned to pur&s;ue the &s;ame intention.&mdash;But being not ma&s;ter of a for|tune equal to that &s;cheme, it never proved of any &s;ervice to him, though many years &s;ince, it has been cultivated largely.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the name of Georgia.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His per&s;on was (in youth) extremely fair, and hand&s;ome; his eyes were a dark blue, both bright and penetrating; brown hair and vi&s;age oval; which was enlivened with a &s;mile, the mo&s;t agreeable in conver&s;ation; where his addre&s;s was affably engage|ing; to which was joined a dignity, which render|ed him at once re&s;pected and admired, by tho&s;e (of either &s;ex) who were acquainted with him&mdash;He was tall, genteelly made, and not thin.&mdash;His voice was &s;weet, his conver&s;ation elegant; and capable of entertaining upon various &s;ubjects.&mdash;His di&s;po&s;i|tion was benevolent, beyond the power of the for|tune he was ble&s;&s;ed with; the calamities of tho&s;e he knew (and valued as de&s;erving) affected him more than his own: He had fortitude of mind &s;uffi|cient to &s;upport with calmne&s;s great misfortune; and from his birth it may be truly &s;aid he was ob|liged to meet it.</P>
<P>Of him&s;elf, he &s;ays in his epi&s;tle dedicatory to one of his poems, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'I am &s;o devoted a lover of a private and un|bu&s;y life, that I cannot recollect a time wherein I wi&s;h'd an increa&s;e to the little influence I culti|vate in the dignified world, unle&s;s when I have felt the deficience of my own power, to reward &s;ome merit that has charm'd me:'&mdash;</P></Q></P>
<P>His temper, though by nature warm (when in|juries were done him) was as nobly forgiving; mindful of that great le&s;&s;on in religion, of returning good for evil; and he fulfilled it often to the pre|judice
<PB N="263" REF="268">
of his own circum&s;tances. He was a tender hu&s;band, friend, and father; one of the be&s;t ma&s;ters to his &s;ervants, deteiting the too common inhumanity, that treats them almo&s;t as if they were not fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>His manner of life was temperate in all re&s;pects (which might have promis'd greater length of years) late hours excepted; which his indefatigable love of &s;tudy drew him into; night being not liable to interruptions like the day.</P>
<P>About the year 1718 he wrote a poem called the Northern-Star, upon the actions of the Czar Peter the Great; and &s;everal years after he was complimented with a gold medal from the empre&s;s Catherine (according to the Czar's de&s;ire before his death) and was to have wrote his life, from papers which were to be &s;ent him of the Czar's: But the death of the Czarina, quickly after, prevented it.&mdash;In an adverti&s;ement to the reader, in the fifth edition of that poem, publi&s;hed in 1739, the author &s;ays of it.<Q REND="inline"><P>'Though the de&s;ign was profe&s;s'd panegyric, I may with mode&s;ty venture to &s;ay it was not a very politic, perhaps, but an hone&s;t example of prai&s;e without flattery.&mdash;In the ver&s;e, I am afraid there was much to be blamed, as too low; but, I am &s;ure there was none of that fault in the purpo&s;e: The poem having never been hinted, either before or after the publication, to any per&s;on (native or foreigner) who could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have intere&s;t in, or concern for, its &s;ubject.</P>
<P>'In effect, it had for &s;ix years or more been for|got by my&s;elf&mdash;and my country,&mdash;when upon the death of the prince it referred to, I was &s;urprized by the conde&s;cen&s;ion of a compliment from the empre&s;s his relict, and immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and thereby fir&s;t became &s;en&s;ible that the poem had, by means of &s;ome foreign tran&s;lation, reach'd the eye and regard of that emphatically great monarch, in ju&s;tice to whom it was written.'</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="269">
Soon after he fini&s;hed &s;ix books more of Gideon; which made eight, of the twelve he purpos'd writ|ing; but did not live to fini&s;h it.</P>
<P>In 1723 he brought his Tragedy called King Henry the Vth, upon the &s;tage in Drury-Lane; which is (as he declares in the preface) a new fabric, yet built on Shake&s;pear's foundation.</P>
<P>In 1724, for the advantage of an unhappy gen|tleman (an old officer in the army) he wrote a paper in the manner of the Spectators, in conjunction with Mr. William Bond, &amp;c. intitled the Plain Dealer; which were &s;ome time after publi&s;hed in two volumes octavo. And many of his former writings were appropriated to &s;uch humane u&s;es; both tho&s;e to which he has prefixed his name, and &s;everal others which he wrote and gave away intirely. But, though the many imagined authors are not living, their names, and tho&s;e performances will be omitted here; yet, in mere ju&s;tice to the character of Mr. Hill, we mention this particular.</P>
<P>In 1728, he made a journey into the North of Scotland, where he had been about two years be|fore, having contracted with the York-Buildings Company, concerning many woods of great extent in that kingdom, for timber for the u&s;es of the navy; and many and various were the a&s;&s;ertions up|on this occa&s;ion: Some thought, and thence re|ported, that there was not a &s;tick in Scotland could be capable of an&s;wering that purpo&s;e; but he de|mon&s;trated the contrary: For, though there was not a great number large enough for ma&s;ts to &s;hips of the greate&s;t burthen; yet there were millions, fit for all &s;maller ve&s;&s;els; and planks and bauks, proper for every &s;ort of building.&mdash;One &s;hip was built en|tirely of it; and a report was made, that never any better timber was brought from any part of the world: But he found many difficulties in this under|taking; yet had &s;agacity to overcome them all (as far as his own management extended) for when the
<PB N="265" REF="270">
trees were by his order chain'd together into floats, the ignorant Highlanders refus'd to venture them|&s;elves on them down the river Spey; till he fir&s;t went him&s;elf, to make them &s;en&s;ible there was no danger.&mdash;In which pa&s;&s;age however, he found a great ob&s;tacle in the rocks, by which that river &s;eemed impa&s;&s;ible; but on the&s;e he ordered fires to be made, when by the lowne&s;s of the river they were mo&s;t expos'd; and then had quantities of water thrown upon them: Which method being repeated with the help of proper tools, they were broke in pieces and thrown down, which made the pa&s;&s;age ea&s;y for the floats.</P>
<P>This affair was carried on to a very good account, till tho&s;e concern'd thought proper to call off the men and hor&s;es from the woods of Abernethy, in order to employ them in their lead mines in the &s;ame country; from which they hoped to make greater advantage.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates of Inverne&s;s paid him the com|pliment of making him a pre&s;ent of the freedom of that place (at an elegant entertainment made by them on that occa&s;ion) a favour likewi&s;e offered him at Aberdeen, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After a &s;tay of &s;everal months in the Highlands, during which time he vi&s;ited the duke and duche&s;s of Gordon, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him with great civi|lities, he went to York, and other places in that country; where his wife then was, with &s;ome rela|tions, for the recovery of her health; but his &s;taying longer there (on that account) than he intended, had like to have proved of unhappy con&s;equence; by giving room for &s;ome, who imagined (as they wi&s;hed) that he would not return, to be guilty of a breach of tru&s;t that aimed at the de&s;truction of great part of what he then was worth; but they were di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>In that retirement in the North, he wrote a poem intitled, The Progre&s;s of Wit, a Caveat for the
<PB N="266" REF="271">
u&s;e of an eminent Writer. It was compo&s;ed of the genteele&s;t prai&s;e, and keene&s;t allegorical &s;atire; and it gave no &s;mall unea&s;ine&s;s to Mr. Pope: Who had indeed drawn it upon him&s;elf, by being the aggre&s;&s;or in his Dunciad.&mdash;This afterwards occa&s;ioned a pri|vate paper-war between tho&s;e writers, in which 'tis generally thought that Mr. Hill had greatly the advantage of Mr. Pope. For the particulars, the reader is referred to a &s;hilling pamphlet lately publi&s;hed by Owen, containing Letters between Mr. Pope and Mr. Hill, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of wit begins with the eight follow|ing lines, wherein the SNEAKINGLY APPROVES affected Mr. Pope extreamly.<Q><L>Tuneful Alexis on the Thames' fair &s;ide,</L>

<P>During their controver&s;y, Mr. Pope &s;eemed to expre&s;s his repentance, by denying the offence he had given; thus, in one of his letters, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'That the letters A.

<P>In 1731 he brought his Tragedy of Athelwold upon the &s;tage in Drury-Lane; which, as he &s;ays in his preface to it, was written on the &s;ame &s;ubject as his Elfrid or the Fair Incon&s;tant, which he there calls, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'An unprun'd wilderne&s;s of fancy, with here and there a flower among the leaves; but without any fruit of judgment.&mdash;'</Q></P>

<P>He was a man &s;u&s;ceptible of love, in its &s;ublime&s;t &s;en&s;e; as may be &s;een in that poetical de&s;cription of that pa&s;&s;ion, which he has given in his poem called the Picture of Love; wrote many years ago (from whence the following two lines are taken)<Q><L>No wild de&s;ire can this proud bli&s;s be&s;tow,</L>

<P>About the year 1735 he was concern'd with an|other gentleman in writing a paper called the Prompter; all tho&s;e mark'd with a B. were his.&mdash;This was meant greatly for the &s;ervice of the &s;tage; and many of them have been regarded in the highe&s;t manner.&mdash;But, as there was not only in&s;truction, but reproof, the bitter, with the &s;weet, by &s;ome could not be reli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>In 1736 having tran&s;lated from the French of Mon&s;ieur de Voltaire, the Tragedy of Zara, he gave it to be acted for the benefit of Mr. William
<PB N="270" REF="275">
Bond; and it was repre&s;ented fir&s;t, at the Long-Room in Villars-Street, York-Buildings; where that poor gentleman performed the part of Lu&s;ignan (the old expiring king) a character he was at that time too well &s;uited to; being, and looking, almo&s;t dead, as in reality he was before the run of it was over.&mdash;Soon after this play was brought upon the &s;tage in Drury-Lane, by Mr. Fleetwood, at the earne&s;t &s;ollicitation of Mr. Theophilus Cibber; the part of Zara was played by Mrs. Cibber, and was her fir&s;t attempt in Tragedy; of the performers therein he makes very hand&s;ome mention in the preface. This play he dedicated to his royal high|ne&s;s the Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year was acted, at the Theatre in Lin|coln's-Inn-Fields, another Tragedy of his tran&s;lat|ing from the &s;ame French author, called Alzira, which was likewi&s;e dedicated to the Prince.&mdash;His dedications generally wore a different face from tho&s;e of other writers; he there mo&s;t warmly re|commends Mon&s;ieur de Voltaire, as worthy of his royal highne&s;s's partiality; di&s;claiming for him&s;elf all expectations of his notice. But he was, notwith|&s;tanding, particularly honoured with his approba|tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e plays, if not a litteral tran&s;lation, have been thought much better, for their having pa&s;t his hands; as generou&s;ly was acknowledged by Mon|&s;ieur de Voltaire him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In 1737 he publi&s;hed a poem called, The Tears of the Mu&s;es; compo&s;ed of general &s;atire: in the addre&s;s to the reader he &s;ays (&s;peaking of &s;atire)<Q REND="inline"><P>'There is, indeed, &s;omething &s;o like cruelty in the face of that &s;pecies of poetry, that it can only be reconciled to humanity, by the general benevo|lence of its purpo&s;e; attacking particulars for the public advantage.'</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="276">
The following year he wrote (in pro&s;e) a book called, An Enquiry into the Merit of A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, with a View to the Character of Cae&s;ar; and his De&s;igns on the Roman Republic.</P>
<P>About this time, he in a manner left the world, (though living near &s;o populous a part of it as Lon|don) and &s;ettled at Plai&s;tow in E&s;&s;ex; where he en|tirely devoted him&s;elf to his &s;tudy, family, and garden; and the accompli&s;hment of many profitable views; particularly one, in which for years he had laboured through experiments in vain; and when he brought it to perfection, did not live to reap the benefit of it: The di&s;covery of the art of making pot-a&s;h like the Ru&s;&s;ian, which co&s;t this nation, yearly, an immen&s;e &s;um of money.</P>
<P>In the year 1743 he publi&s;hed The Fanciad, an Heroic Poem; in&s;cribed to his grace the duke of Marlborough: Who as no name was then prefixed to it, perhaps, knew not the author by whom he was di&s;tingui&s;hed in it.</P>
<P>Soon after he wrote another, intitled the Impar|tial; which he in&s;cribed, in the &s;ame manner, to the lord Carteret (now earl of Granville). In the beginning of it are the following lines,<Q><LG>

<P>It would be tedious to enumerate the variety of &s;maller pieces he at different times was author of.</P>
<P>His notions of the deity were boundle&s;sly ex|ten&s;ive; and the few lines here quoted from his Poem upon faith, publi&s;hed in 1746, mu&s;t give the be&s;t idea of his &s;entiments upon that mo&s;t elevated of all &s;ubjects.<Q><PB N="272" REF="277"><L>What then mu&s;t be believ'd?&mdash;Believe God kind,</L>

<P>Having for many years been in a manner forget|ful of the eight Books he had fini&s;hed of his Epic Poem called Gideon,&mdash;in 1749 he re-peru&s;ed that work, and publi&s;hed three of the Books; to which he gave the name of Gideon, or the Patriot.&mdash;They were in&s;cribed to the late lord Bolingbroke; to whom he accounts as follows, for the altera|tions he had made &s;ince the fir&s;t publication of two Books.<Q><L>Erring, where thou&s;ands err'd, in youth's hot &s;mart,</L>

&s;ucce&s;s) his Tragedy, called Merope, was brought upon the &s;tage in Drury-Lane by Mr. Garrick; to whom, as well as to another gentleman he like|wi&s;e highly both admired and e&s;teemed, he was greatly obliged; and his own words (here borrowed) will &s;hew how ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e he had of the&s;e obliga|tions.&mdash;They begin the preface to the play.<Q REND="inline"><P>'If there can be a pride that ranks with virtues, it is that we feel from friend&s;hips with the worthy.

<P>From about the time he was &s;olliciting the bring|ing on this play, an illne&s;s &s;eized him; from the tormenting pains of which he had &s;carce an hour's intermi&s;&s;ion; and after making trial of all he thought could be of &s;ervice to him in medicine; he was de&s;irous to try his native air of London (as that of Plai&s;tow was too moi&s;t a one) but he was then pa&s;t all recovery, and wa&s;ted almo&s;t to a &s;keleton, from &s;ome internal cau&s;e, that had produced a ge|neral decay (and was believed to have been an in|flamation in the kidneys; which his inten&s;e at|tachment to his &s;tudies might probably lay the foundation of.&mdash;When in town, he had the comfort of being honoured with the vi&s;its of the mo&s;t wor|thy and e&s;teemed among his friends; but he was not permitted many weeks to ta&s;te that ble&s;&s;ing.</P>

<P>Some years before his death, he talked of making a collection of his works for publication; but po&s;t|poned it for the fini&s;hing &s;ome pieces, which he did not live to effect.</P>
<P>Since his death, four volumes of them have been publi&s;hed by &s;ub&s;cription, for his family.

<HEAD>Mr. LEWIS THEOBALD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was born at Sittingburn in Kent, of which place his father, Mr. Peter Theobald, was an eminent attorney. His gram|matical learning he received chiefly under the revd. Mr. Ellis, at I&s;leworth in Middle&s;ex, and after|wards
<PB N="277" REF="282">
applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy and practice of the law: but finding that &s;tudy too tedious and irk&s;ome for his genius, he quitted it for the profe&s;&s;i|on of poetry. He engaged in a paper called the Cen&s;or, publi&s;hed in Mi&s;t's Weekly Journal; and by delivering his opinion with two little re&s;erve, concerning &s;ome eminent wits, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to their la&s;hes, and re&s;entment. Upon the publica|tion of Pope's Homer, he prai&s;ed it in the mo&s;t ex|travagant terms of admiration; but afterwards thought proper to retract his opinion, for rea&s;ons we cannot gue&s;s, and abu&s;ed the very performance he had before hyperbollically prai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope at fir&s;t made Mr. Theobald the hero of his Dunciad, but afterwards, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, he thought proper to di&s;robe him of that dignity, and be&s;tow it upon another: with what propriety we &s;hall not take upon us to determine, but refer the reader to Mr. Cibber's two letters to Mr. Pope. He was made hero of the poem, the annotator informs us, becau&s;e no better was to be had. In the fir&s;t book of the Dunciad, Mr. Theobald, or Tibbald, as he is there called, is thus &s;tigmati&s;ed,<Q><L>&mdash;Dullne&s;s her image full expre&s;t,</L>

<P>In the year 1726 Mr. Theobald publi&s;hed a piece in octavo, called Shake&s;pear Re&s;tored: Of this it is &s;aid, he was &s;o vain as to aver, in one of Mi&s;t's Journals, June the 8th, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That to expo&s;e any errors in it was impracticable;'</Q> and in an|other, April the 27th, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That whatever care might for the future be taken, either by Mr. Pope, or any other a&s;&s;i&s;tants, he would give above five-hun|dred emendations, that would e&s;cape them all.'</Q></P>
<P>During two whole years, while Mr. Pope was preparing his edition, he publi&s;hed adverti&s;ements, reque&s;ting a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promi&s;ing &s;atisfaction to any who would contribute to its greater perfection. But this re&s;torer, who was at that time &s;olliciting fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ours of him, by letters, did wholly conceal that he had any &s;uch de&s;ign till after its publication; which he owned in the Daily Journal of November 26, 1728: and then an outery was made, that Mr. Pope had joined with the book&s;eller to rai&s;e an ex|travagant &s;ub&s;cription; in which he had no &s;hare,
<PB N="279" REF="284">
of which he had no knowledge, and again&s;t which he had publickly adverti&s;ed in his own propo&s;als for Homer.</P>
<P>Mr. Theobald was not only thus obnoxious to the re&s;entment of Pope, but we find him waging war with Mr. Dennis, who treated him with more rough|ne&s;s, though with le&s;s &s;atire. Mr. Theobald in the Cen&s;or, Vol. II. No. XXXIII. calls Mr. Dennis by the name of Furius. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The modern Furius (&s;ays he) is to be looked upon as more the object of pity, than that which he daily provokes, laughter, and contempt.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You de&s;ire to know, why in the general attack which Mr. Pope has lately made again&s;t writers
<PB N="281" REF="286">
living and dead, he has &s;o often had a fling of &s;atire at me. I &s;hould be very willing to plead guilty to his indictment, and think as meanly of my&s;elf as he can po&s;&s;ibly do, were his quarrel altogether upon a &s;air, or unbia&s;&s;ed nature. But he is angry at the man; and as Juvenal &s;ays&mdash;<Q>Facit indignatio ver&s;um.</Q> He has been plea&s;ed to reflect on me in a few quotations from a play, which I had lately the good fortune to u&s;her into the world; I am there concerned in reputation to enter upon my defence. There are three pa&s;&s;ages in his Art of Sinking in Poetry, which he endeavours to bring into di&s;|grace from the Double Fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages alledged by our critical ex|aminer is of that &s;tamp, which is certain to include me in the cla&s;s of profound writers. The place &s;o offen&s;ive for its cloudine&s;s, is,<Q><L>&mdash;The ob&s;curene&s;s of her birth</L>
<L>Cannot eclip&s;e the lu&s;tre of her eyes,</L>
<L>Which make her all one light.</L></Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, I think, there needs no great Oedipus to &s;olve the difficulty of this pa&s;&s;age. No|thing has ever been more common, than for lovers to compare their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es eyes to &s;uns and &s;tars. And what does Henriquez &s;ay more here than this, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That though his mi&s;tre&s;s be ob&s;cure by her birth; yet her eyes are &s;o refulgent, they &s;et her above that di&s;advantage, and make her all over bright|ne&s;s.'</Q> I remember another rapture in Shake|&s;pear, upon a painter's drawing a fine lady's pic|ture, where the thought &s;eems to me every whit as magnified and dark at the fir&s;t glance,

<P>This pa&s;&s;age is taken from the Merchant of Ve|nice, which will appear the more beautiful, the more it is con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Another pa&s;&s;age which Mr. Pope is plea&s;ed to be merry with, is in a &s;peech of Violante's;<Q>Wax! render up thy tru&s;t.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>This, in his Engli&s;h is open the letter; and he facetiou&s;ly mingles it with &s;ome pompous in&s;tances, mo&s;t I believe of his own framing; which in plain terms &s;ignify no more than, See, who&s;e there; &s;nuff the candle; uncork the bottle; chip the bread; to &s;hew how ridiculous actions of no con&s;equence are, when too much exalted in the diction. This he brings under a figure, which he calls the Bu&s;kin, or Stately. But we'll examine circum&s;tances fairly, and then we &s;hall &s;ee which is mo&s;t ridiculous; the phra&s;e, or our &s;agacious cen&s;urer.</P>
<P>Violante is newly debauched by Henriquez, on his &s;olemn promi&s;e of marrying her: She thinks he is returning to his father's court, as he told her, for a &s;hort time; and expects no letter from him. His &s;ervant who brings the letter, contradicts his ma|&s;ter's going for court; and tells her he is gone &s;ome two months progre&s;s another way, upon a change of purpo&s;e. She who knew what conce&s;&s;ions &s;he had made to him, declares her&s;elf by &s;tarts, under the greate&s;t agonies; and immediately upon the &s;ervant leaving her, expre&s;&s;es an equal impatience, and fear of the contents of this unexpected letter.<Q><L>To hearts like mine, &s;u&s;pence is mi&s;ery.</L>
<L>Wax! render up thy tru&s;t,&mdash;Be the contents</L>
<L>Pro&s;perous, or fatal, they are all my due.</L></Q></P>

Now Mr Pope &s;hews us his profound judgment in dramatical pa&s;&s;ions; thinks a lady in her circum|&s;tances cannot without ab&s;urdity open a letter that &s;eems to her as &s;urprize, with any more preparation than the mo&s;t unconcerned per&s;on alive &s;hould a common letter by the penny-po&s;t. I am aware Mr. Pope may reply, his cavil was not again&s;t the action it&s;elf of addre&s;&s;ing to the wax, but of exalting that action in the terms. In this point I may fairly &s;helter my&s;elf under the judgment of a man, who&s;e character in poetry will vie with any rival this age &s;hall produce.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden in his E&s;&s;ay on Dramatic Poetry, tells us. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That when from the mo&s;t elevated thoughts of ver&s;e, we pa&s;s to tho&s;e which are mo&s;t mean, and which are common with the low|e&s;t hou&s;hold conver&s;ation; yet &s;till there is a choice to be made of the be&s;t words, and the lea&s;t vulgar (provided they be apt) to expre&s;s &s;uch thoughts. Our language, &s;ays he, is noble, full, and &s;ignificant; and I know not, why he who is ma&s;ter of it, may not cloath ordinary things in it, as decently as the Latin, if we u&s;e the &s;ame diligence in the choice of words.'</Q></P>

<P>This, he hints, may &s;eem borrowed from the thought of that ma&s;ter of a &s;how in Smithfield, who wrote in large letters over the picture of his Elephant. <HI>This is the greate&s;t Elephant in the world except him&s;elf.</HI> I like the plea&s;antry of the banter, but have no great doubt of getting clear from the &s;everity of it. The lines in the play &s;tand thus.

<L>None but it&s;elf can be its parallel.</L></Q></P>
<P>I am not a little &s;urprized, to find that our exa|aminer at la&s;t is dwindled into a word-catcher. Literally &s;peaking, indeed, I agree with Mr. Pope, that nothing can be the parallel to it&s;elf; but allow|ing a little for the liberty of expre&s;&s;ion, does it not plainly imply, that it is a treachery which &s;tands &s;ingle for the nature of its ba&s;ene&s;s, and has not its parallel on record; and that nothing but a treachery equal to it in ba&s;ene&s;s can parallel it? If this were &s;uch non&s;en&s;e as Pope would willingly have it, it would be a very bad plea for me to al|ledge, as the truth is, that the line is in Shake|&s;pear's old copy; for I might have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it. But I hope it is defen&s;ible; at lea&s;t if examples can keep it in countenance. There is a piece of non&s;en&s;e of the &s;ame kind in the Amphytrio of Plautus: Sofia having &s;urvey'd Mercury from top to toe, finds him &s;uch an exact re&s;emblance of him|&s;elf, in dre&s;s, &s;hape, and features, that he cries out,<Q>Tam con&s;imil' e&s;t, at&abque; ego.</Q></P>
<P>That is, he is as like me, as I am to my&s;elf. Now I humbly conceive, in &s;trictne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion a man can no more be like him&s;elf, than a thing its own parallel. But to confine my&s;elf to Shake&s;pear. I doubt not but I can produce &s;ome &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages from him, which literally examined, are &s;tark non|&s;en&s;e; and yet taken with a candid latitude have never appeared ridiculous. Mr. Pope would &s;carce allow one man to &s;ay to another. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Compare and weigh your mi&s;tre&s;s with your mi&s;tre&s;s; and I grant &s;he is a very fair woman; but compare her with &s;ome other woman that I could name, and

<HEAD>The Revd. Dr. SAMUEL CROXALL,</HEAD>
<P>THE celebrated author of the Fair Circa&s;&s;ian, was &s;on of the revd. Mr. Samuel Croxall, rector of Hanworth, Middle&s;ex, and vicar of Wal|ton upon Thames in Surry, in the la&s;t of which places our author was born. He received his early education at Eton &s;chool, and from thence was admitted to St. John's College, Cambridge. Probably while he was at the univer&s;ity, he be|came enamoured of Mrs. Anna Maria Mordaunt, who fir&s;t in&s;pired his brea&s;t with love, and to whom he dedicates the poem of the Circa&s;&s;ian, for which he has been &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed. This dedication is indeed the characteri&s;tic of a youth in love, but then it likewi&s;e proves him altogether unacquainted with the world, and with that ea&s;i|ne&s;s of addre&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hes a gentleman. A reclu&s;e &s;cholar may be pa&s;&s;ionately in love, but he di&s;covers it by &s;trains of bomba&s;t, and forced allu&s;ions, of which this dedication is a very lively in&s;tance.</P>

of this addre&s;s, and favour my weak endea|vours. If my confe&s;&s;ion of your divine power is any where too faint, believe it not to proceed from a want of due re&s;pect, but of a capacity more than human. Whoever thinks of you can no longer be him&s;elf; and if he could, ought to be &s;omething above man to celebrate the ac|compli&s;hment of a godde&s;s. To you I owe my creation as a lover, and in the beams of your beauty only I live, move, and exi&s;t. If there &s;hould be a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of your charms, I &s;hould fall to nothing. But it &s;eems to be out of your power to deprive us of their kind influence: wherever you &s;hine they fill all our hearts, and you are charming out of nece&s;&s;ity, as the author of nature is good.'</Q> We have quoted enough to &s;hew the enthu&s;ia&s;m, or rather phrenzy, of this ad|dre&s;s, which is written in &s;uch a manner as if it were intended for a burle&s;que on the Fal&s;e Sublime, as the &s;peeches of James I. are upon pedantry.</P>
<P>Mr. Croxall, who was intended for holy orders, and, probably, when he publi&s;hed the Circa&s;&s;ian, had really entered into them, was cautious le&s;t he &s;hould be known to be the author of this piece, &s;ince many divines have e&s;teemed the Song of Solo|mon, from which it is taken, as an in&s;pired poem, emblematic of the Me&s;&s;iah and the Church. Our au|thor was of another opinion, and with him almo&s;t all &s;en&s;ible men join, in believing that it is no more than a beautiful poem, compo&s;ed by that Ea&s;tern monarch, upon &s;ome favourite lady in his Seraglio. He artfully introduces it with a preface, in which he informs us, that it was the compo&s;ition of a young gentleman, his pupil, lately decea&s;ed, exe|cuted by him, while he was influenced by that vi|olent pa&s;&s;ion with which Mrs. Mordaunt in&s;pired him. He then endeavours to a&s;certain who this Ea&s;tern beauty was, who had charms to enflame the heart of the royal poet. He is of opinion it
<PB N="290" REF="295">
could not be Pharaoh's daughter, as has been com|monly conjectured, becau&s;e the bride in the Can|ticles is characteri&s;ed as a private per&s;on, a &s;hep|herde&s;s, one that kept a vineyard, and was ill u&s;ed by her mother's children, all which will a|gree very well with &s;omebody el&s;e, but cannot, without great &s;training, be drawn to &s;it the Egyp|tian Prince&s;s. He then proceeds, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'&s;eeing we have &s;o good rea&s;on to conclude that it was not Pharaoh's daughter, we will next endeavour to &s;hew who &s;he was: and here we are de&s;titute of all manner of light, but what is afforded us by that little Arabian manu&s;cript, mentioned in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions of Am&s;terdam, 1558, &s;aid to be found in a marble che&s;t among the ruins of Palmyra, and pre&s;ented to the univer&s;i|ty of Leyden by Dr. Hermanus Hoffman. The contents of which are &s;omething in the nature of Memoirs of the Court of Solomon; giving a &s;ufficient account of the chief offices and po&s;ts in his hou&s;hold; of the &s;everal funds of the royal revenue; of the di&s;tinct apartments of his pa|lace there; of the different Seraglios, being fif|ty two in number in that one city. Then there is an account given of the Sultanas; their man|ner of treatment and living; their birth and country, with &s;ome touches of their per&s;onal en|dowments, how long they continued in favour, and what the re&s;ult was of the King's fondne&s;s for each of them. Among the&s;e, there is par|ticular mention made of a &s;lave of more exceed|ing beauty than had ever been known before; at who&s;e appearance the charms of all the re&s;t vani&s;hed like &s;tars before the morning &s;un; that the King cleaved to her with the &s;tronge&s;t af|fection, and was not &s;een out of the Seraglio, where &s;he was kept, for about a month. That &s;he was taken captive, together with her mother, out of a vineyard, on the Coa&s;t of Circa&s;&s;ia,
<PB N="291" REF="296">
by a Cor&s;air of Hiram King of Tyre, and brought to Jeru&s;alem. It is &s;aid, &s;he was placed in the ninth Seraglio, to the ea&s;t of Palmyra, which, in the Hebrew tongue, is called Tadmor; which, without further particulars, are &s;ufficient to convince us that this was the charming per|&s;on, &s;ung with &s;o much rapture by the Royal poet, and in the recital of who&s;e amour he &s;eems &s;o tran&s;ported. For &s;he &s;peaks of her&s;elf as one that kept a vineyard, and her mother's introducing her in one of the gardens of plea|&s;ure (as it &s;eems &s;he did at her fir&s;t pre&s;enting her to the King) is here di&s;tinctly mentioned. The manu&s;cript further takes notice, that &s;he was called Saphira, from the heavenly blue of her eyes.'</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the caution with which Mr. Croxall publi&s;hed the Fair Circa&s;&s;ian, yet it was &s;ome years after known to be his. The &s;ucce&s;s it met with, which was not indeed above its de&s;ert, was perhaps too much for vanity (of which authors are &s;eldom entirely dive&s;ted) to re&s;i&s;t, and he might be betrayed into a confe&s;&s;ion, from that powerful principle, of what otherwi&s;e would have remained concealed.</P>
<P>Some years after it was publi&s;hed, Mr. Cragg, one of the mini&s;ters of the city of Edinburgh, gave the world a &s;mall volume of &s;piritual poems, in one of which he takes occa&s;ion to complain of the pro&s;titution of genius, and that few poets have ever turned their thoughts towards religious &s;ubjects; and mentions the author of the Circa&s;&s;ian with great indignation, for having pro&s;ti|tuted his Mu&s;e to the purpo&s;es of lewdne&s;s, in con|verting the Song of Solomon (a work, as he thought it, of &s;acred in&s;piration) into an amorous dialogue between a King and his mi&s;tre&s;s. His words are,

<P>The revd. gentleman met with &s;ome remon&s;trances from his friends, for indulging &s;o &s;plenetic a tem|per, when he was writing in the cau&s;e of religion, as to wi&s;h any man accur&s;ed. Of this cen&s;ure he was not in&s;en&s;ible; in the next edition of his poems, he &s;oftened the &s;arca&s;m, by declaring, in a note, that he had no enmity to the author's per&s;on, and that when he wi&s;hed him accur&s;ed, he meant not the man, but the author, which are two very di|&s;tinct con&s;iderations; for an author may be ac|cur&s;ed, that is, damned to &s;ame, while the man may be in as fair a way to happine&s;s as any body; but, continues he, I &s;hould not have ex|pected &s;uch prophanation from a clergyman.</P>
<P>The Circa&s;&s;ian, however, is a beautiful poem, the numbers are generally &s;mooth, and there is a tender delicacy in the dialogue, though greatly in|ferior to the noble original.</P>
<P>Mr. Croxall had not long quitted the univer&s;ity, e'er he was in&s;tituted to the living of Hampton in Middle&s;ex; and afterwards to the united pari&s;hes of St. Mary Somer&s;et, and St. Mary Mounthaw, in the city of London, both which he held 'till his death. He was al&s;o chancellor, prebend, and canon re&s;identiary and portioni&s;t of the church of Hereford. Towards the latter end of the reign of Queen Anne he publi&s;hed two original Cantos, in imitation of Spen&s;er's Fairy Queen, which were meant as a &s;atire on the earl of Oxford's admi|ni&s;tration. In the year 1715 he addre&s;&s;ed a poem to the duke of Argyle, upon his obtaining a Victory over the Rebels, and the &s;ame year publi&s;h|ed The Vi&s;ion, a poem, addre&s;&s;ed to the earl of

Halifax. He was concerned, with many others, in the tran&s;lation of Ovid's Metamorpho&s;es, of which the following were performed by him:<LIST>
<ITEM>The Story of Ni&s;us and Scylla, from the &s;ixth Book.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Labyrinth, and Daedalus and Icarus, from the eighth Book.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Part of the Fable of Cypari&s;&s;us from the tenth Book.</ITEM>

<P>He likewi&s;e performed an entire Tran&s;lation of Ae&s;op's Fables.</P>

He is al&s;o author of a curious work, in one Volume Octavo, entitled Scripture Politics: being a view of the original con&s;titution, and &s;ub|&s;equent revolutions in the government of that peo|ple, out of whom the Saviour of the World was to ari&s;e: As it is contained in the Bible.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of his &s;trong attachment to the Whig intere&s;t, he was made archdeacon of Salop 1732, and chaplain in ordinary to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>As late as the year 1750, Dr. Croxall pub|li&s;hed a poem called The Royal Manual, in the preface to which he endeavours to &s;hew, that it was compo&s;ed by Mr. Andrew Marvel, and found among&s;t his MSS. but the proprietor declares, that it was written by Dr. Croxall him&s;elf. This was the la&s;t of his performances, for he died the year following, in a pretty advanced age.

<PB N="298" REF="303">
<HEAD>The Revd. Mr. CHRISTOPHER PITT,</HEAD>
<P>THE celebrated tran&s;later of Virgil, was born in the year 1699. He received his ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly education in the college near Winche&s;ter; and in 1719 was removed from thence to new col|lege in Oxford. When he had &s;tudied there four years, he was preferred to the living of Pimperne in Dor&s;et&s;hire, by his friend and relation, Mr. George Pitt; which he held during the remaining part of his life. While he was at the univer&s;ity, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the affection and e&s;teem of all who knew him; and was particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by that great poet Dr. Young, who &s;o much admired the early di&s;|pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">s of his genius, that with an engaging fami|liarity he u&s;ed to call him his &s;on.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the fir&s;t of Mr. Pitt's performances which &s;aw the light, were a panegyrie on lord Stan|hope, and a poem on the Plague of Mar&s;eilles: But he had two large Folio's of MS. Poems, very fairly written ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, while he was a &s;chool-boy, which at the time of election were delivered to the examiners. One of the&s;e volumes contained an entire tran&s;lation of Lucan; and the other con&s;i&s;ted of Mi&s;cellaneous pieces. Mr. Pitt's Lucan has never been publi&s;hed; perhaps from the con&s;ideration of its being the pro|duction of his early life, or from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its not equalling the tran&s;lation of that author by Rowe, who executed this ta&s;k in the meri|dian of his genius. Several of his other pieces were publi&s;hed afterwards, in his volume of Mi&s;|cellaneous Poems.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="304">
The ingenious writer of the Student hath o|bliged the world by in&s;erting in that work &s;everal original pieces by Mr. Pitt; who&s;e name is prefixed to them.</P>
<P>Next to his beautiful Tran&s;lation of Virgil, Mr. Pitt gained the greate&s;t reputation by rendering into Engli&s;h, Vida's Art of Poetry, which he has exe|cuted with the &s;tricte&s;t attention to the author's &s;en&s;e, with the utmo&s;t elegance of ver&s;ification, and without &s;uffering the noble &s;pirit of the original to be lo&s;t in his tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>This amiable poet died in the year 1748, with|out leaving one enemy behind him. On his tomb|&s;tone were engraved the&s;e words,<Q>" He lived innocent, and died beloved."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Auditor Ben&s;on, who in a pamphlet of his writing, has treated Dryden's tran&s;lation of Virgil with great contempt, was yet charmed with that by Mr. Pitt, and found in it &s;ome beauties, of which he was fond even to a degree of en|thu&s;ia&s;im. Alliteration is one of tho&s;e beauties Mr. Ben&s;on &s;o much admired, and in prai&s;e of which he has a long di&s;&s;ertation in his letters on tran&s;lated ver&s;e. He once took an opportunity, in conver&s;ation with Mr. Pitt, to magnify that beauty, and to compliment him upon it. Mr. Pitt thought this article far le&s;s con&s;iderable than Mr. Ben&s;on did; but &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'&s;ince you are &s;o fond of alliteration, the following couplet upon Cardinal Wool&s;ey will not di&s;plea&s;e you,
<Q><L>' Begot by butchers, but by bi&s;hops bred.</L>
<L>' How high his honour holds his haughty head.</L></Q></Q> Ben&s;on was no doubt charmed to hear his favourite grace in poetry &s;o beautifully exemplified, which it certainly is, without any affectation or &s;tiffne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="305">
Waller thought this a beauty; and Dryden was very fond of it. Some late writers, under the no|tion of imitating the&s;e two great ver&s;ifiers in this point, run into downright affectation, and are g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ilty of the mo&s;t improper and ridiculous expre&s;|&s;ions, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ovided there be but an alliteration. It is very remarkable, that an affectation of this beauty is ridiculed by Shake&s;pear, in Love's Labour Lo&s;t, Act II. where the Pedant Holofernes &s;ays,<Q>I will &s;omething affect the letter, for it argues facility.&mdash;</Q><Q>The prai&s;eful prince&s;s pierced, and prickt.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Upton, in his letter concerning Spencer, ob|&s;erves, that alliteration is ridiculed too in Chaucer, in a pa&s;&s;age which every reader does not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>The Ploughman's Tale is written, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, in imitation of Pierce's Ploughman's Vi&s;ions; and runs chiefly upon &s;ome one letter, or at lea&s;t many &s;tanza's have this affected iteration, as<Q><L>A full &s;terne &s;triefe is &s;tirr'd now,&mdash;</L>
<L>For &s;ome be grete grown on grounde.</L></Q></P>
<P>When the Par&s;on therefore in his order comes to tell his tale, which reflected on the clergy, he &s;ays,<Q><L>&mdash;I am a &s;outhern man,</L>
<L>I cannot je&s;t, rum, ram, ruff, by letter,</L>
<L>And God wote, rime hold I but little better.</L></Q></P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the publication of Mr. Pitt's ver&s;ion of the Aeneid, the learned world has been divided concerning the ju&s;t proportion of merit, which ought
<PB N="301" REF="306">
to be a&s;cribed to it. Some have made no &s;cruple in defiance of the authority of a name, to prefer it to Dryden's, both in exactne&s;s, as to his author's &s;en&s;e, and even in the charms of poetry. This per|haps, will be be&s;t di&s;covered by producing a few &s;hining pa&s;&s;ages of the Aeneid, tran&s;lated by the&s;e two great ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>In biographical writing, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principal is candour, which no reverence for the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mory of the dead, nor affection for the virtues of the living &s;hould violate. The impartiality which we have endeavoured to ob&s;erve through this work, obliges us to declare, that &s;o far as our judgment may be tru&s;ted, the latter poet has done mo&s;t ju&s;tice to Virgil; that he &s;hines in Pitt with a lu&s;tre, which Dryden wanted not power, but lei&s;ure to be&s;tow; and a reader, from Pitt's ver&s;ion, will both acquire a more intimate knowledge of Virgil's meaning, and a more exalted idea of his abilities.&mdash;Let not this detract from the high repre&s;entations we have en|deavoured in &s;ome other places to make of Dryden. When he undertook Virgil, he was &s;tooping with age, oppre&s;&s;ed with wants, and conflicting with in|firmities. In this &s;ituation, it was no wonder that much of his vigour was lo&s;t; and we ought rather to admire the amazing force of genius, which was &s;o little depre&s;&s;ed under all the&s;e calamities, than indu&s;triou&s;ly to dwell on his imperfections.</P>
<P>Mr. Spence in one of his chapters on Allegory, in his Polymetis, has endeavoured to &s;hew, how very little our poets have under&s;tood the allegories of the antients, even in their tran&s;lations of them; and has in&s;tanced Mr. Dryden's tran&s;lation of the Aeneid, as he thought him one of our mo&s;t celebrated poets. The mi&s;takes are very numerous, and &s;ome of them unaccountably gro&s;s. Upon this,
<PB N="302" REF="307">
&s;ays Mr. Warton, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was de&s;irous to examine Mr. Pitt's tran&s;lation of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages; and was &s;urprized to find near fifty in&s;tances which Mr. Spence has given of Dryden's mi&s;takes of that kind, when Mr. Pitt had not &s;allen into above three or four."</Q> Mr. Warton then pro|duces &s;ome in&s;tances, which we &s;hall not here tran&s;cribe, as it will be more entertaining to our readers to have a few of the mo&s;t &s;hining pa&s;&s;ages compared, in which there is the highe&s;t room for ri&s;ing to a blaze of poetry.</P>

From the above &s;pecimens, our readers may determine for them&s;elves to who&s;e tran&s;lation they would give the preference.

Mr. Pitt, no doubt, had many advantages above Dryden in this arduous province: As he was later in the attempt, he had con&s;equently the ver&s;ion of Dryden to improve up|on.

<HEAD>Mr. HAMMOND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman, known to the world by the Love Elegies, which &s;ome years after his death were publi&s;hed by the Earl of Che&s;terfield, was the &s;on of a Turkey merchant, in the city of
<PB N="308" REF="313">
London. We cannot a&s;certain where he received his education; but it does not appear that he was at any of the univer&s;ities. Mr. Hammond was early preferred to a place about the per&s;on of the late Prince of Wales, which he held till an unfortunate accident &s;tript him of his rea&s;on, or at lea&s;t &s;o affected his imagination, that his &s;en&s;es were greatly di&s;or|dered. The unhappy cau&s;e of his calamity was a pa&s;&s;ion he entertained for one Mi&s;s Da&s;hwood, which proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. Upon this occa&s;ion it was that he wrote his Love Elegies, which have been much celebrated for their tenderne&s;s. The lady either could not return his pa&s;&s;ion with a recip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o|cal fondne&s;s, or entertained too ambitious views to &s;ettle her affections upon him, which he him&s;elf in &s;ome of his Elegies &s;eems to hint; for he frequently mentions her pa&s;&s;ion for gold and &s;plendour, and ju&s;tly treats it as very unworthy a fair one's bo&s;om. The chief beauty of the&s;e Elegies certainly con&s;i&s;ts in their being written by a man who intimately felt the &s;ubject; for they are more the language of the heart than of the head. They have warmth, but little poetry, and Mr. Hammond &s;eems to have been one of tho&s;e poets, who are made &s;o by love, not by nature.</P>
<P>Mr. Hammond died in the year 1743, in the thirty-fir&s;t year of his age, at Stow, the &s;eat of his kind patron, the lord Cobham, who honoured him with a particular intimacy. The editor of Mr. Hammond's Elegies ob&s;erves, that he compo&s;ed them before he was 21 years of age; a period, &s;ays he, when fancy and imagination commonly riot at the expence of judgment and correctne&s;s. He was &s;incere in his love, as in his friend&s;hip; he wrote to his mi&s;tre&s;s, as he &s;poke to his friends, nothing but the true genuine &s;enti|ments of his heart. Tibullus &s;eems to have been the model our author judiciou&s;ly preferred to Ovid;
<PB N="309" REF="314">
the former writing directly from the heart to the heart, the latter too often yielding and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the imagination.</P>
<P>As a &s;pecimen of Mr. Hammond's turn for Elegiac Poetry, we &s;hall quote his third Elegy, in which he upbraids and threatens the avarice of Neaera, and re&s;olves to quit her.<Q><LG>
<L>Should Jove de&s;cend in floods of liquid ore,</L>
<L>And golden torrents &s;tream from every part,</L>
<L>That craving bo&s;om &s;till would heave for more,</L>
<L>Not all the Gods cou'd &s;atisfy thy heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But may thy folly, which can thus di&s;dain</L>
<L>My hone&s;t love, the mighty wrong repay,</L>
<L>May midnight-fire involve thy &s;ordid gain,</L>
<L>And on the &s;hining heaps of rapine prey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May all the youths, like me, by love deceiv'd,</L>
<L>Not quench the ruin, but applaud the doom,</L>
<L>And when thou dy'&s;t, may not one heart be griev'd:</L>
<L>May not one tear bedew the lonely tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the de&s;erving, tender, gen'rous maid,</L>
<L>Who&s;e only care is her poor lover's mind,</L>
<L>Tho' ruthle&s;s age may bid her beauty fade,</L>

<HEAD>Mr. JOHN BANKS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS poet was the &s;on of Mr. John Banks of Sunning in Berk&s;hire, in which place he was born in 1709. His father dying while our author was very young, the care of his education devolved upon an uncle in law, who placed him at a private &s;chool, under the tuition of one Mr. Belpene, an Anabapti&s;t. This &s;choolma&s;ter, &s;o far from encouraging young Banks to make a great progre&s;s in cla&s;&s;ical learning, exerted his influence with his relations to have him taken from &s;chool, and repre&s;ented him as incapable of receiving much erudition. This conduct in Mr. Belpene proceeded from an early jealou&s;y imbibed again&s;t this young man, who, &s;o far from being dull, as the &s;chool-ma&s;ter repre&s;ented him, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ex|traordinary parts, of which he gave very early proofs.</P>
<P>Mr. Belpene was perhaps afraid, that as &s;oon as Mr. Banks &s;hould fini&s;h his education, he would be preferred to him as mini&s;ter to the congregation of Anabapti&s;ts, which place he enjoyed, indepen|dent of his &s;chool. The remon&s;trances of Mr. Belpene prevailed with Mr. Banks's uncle, who took him from &s;chool, and put him apprentice to a Weaver at Reading. Before the expiration of the apprentice&s;hip, Mr. Banks had the misfortune to break his arm, and by that accident was di&s;|qualified from pur&s;uing the employment to which he was bred. How early Mr. Banks began to write we cannot determine, but probably the fir&s;t &s;allies of his wit were directed again&s;t this &s;chool|ma&s;ter,
<PB N="311" REF="316">
by whom he was injuriou&s;ly treated, and by who&s;e unwarrantable jealou&s;y his education, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, was ruined. Our author, by the accident already mentioned, being rendered unfit to obtain a livelihood, by any mechanical employ|ment, was in a &s;ituation deplorable enough. His uncle was either unable, or unwilling to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, or, perhaps, as the relation between them was only collateral, he had not a &s;ufficient degree of tenderne&s;s for him, to make any efforts in his favour. In this perplexity of our young poet's affairs, ten pounds were left him by a relation, which he very oeconomically improved to the be&s;t advantage. He came to London, and purcha&s;ing a parcel of old books, he &s;et up a &s;tall in Spital-Fields.</P>
<P>Much about this time Stephen Duck, who had wrote a poem called The Thre&s;her, reaped very great advantages from it, and was care&s;&s;ed by per&s;ons in power, who, in imitation of the Royal patrone&s;s, heaped favours upon him, perhaps more on account of the extraordinary regard Queen Caroline had &s;hewn him, than any opinion of his merit. Mr. Banks con&s;idered that the &s;ucce&s;s of Mr. Duck was certainly owing to the peculiarity of his circum&s;tances, and that the novelty of a thre&s;her writing ver&s;es, was the ge|nuine cau&s;e of his being taken notice of, and not any intrin&s;ic excellence in the ver&s;es them&s;elves. This re|flexion in&s;pired him with a re&s;olution of making an effort of the &s;ame kind; but as curio&s;rty was no more to be excited by novelty, the attempt was without &s;ucce&s;s. He wrote, in imitation of The Thre&s;her, The Weaver's Mi&s;cellany, which failed producing the intended effect, and, 'tis &s;aid, ne|ver was reckoned by Mr. Banks him&s;elf as any way worthy of particular di&s;tinction. His bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;elling books upon a &s;tall becoming di&s;agreea|ble to him, as it demanded a con&s;tant and uncom|fortable attendance, he quitted that way of life,
<PB N="312" REF="317">
and was received into the &s;hop of one Mr. Mon|tague a bookbinder, and book&s;eller, whom he &s;erved &s;ome time as a journeyman. During the time he lived with Mr. Montague, he employed his lei&s;ure hours in compo&s;ing &s;everal poems, which were now &s;welled to &s;uch a number, that he might &s;ollicit a &s;ub&s;cription for them with a good grace. He had taken care to improve his acquaintance, and as he had a power of di&s;tingui&s;hing his company, he found his intere&s;t higher in the world than he had imagined. He addre&s;&s;ed a poem to Mr. Pope, which he tran&s;mitted to that gentleman, with a copy of his propo&s;als inclo&s;ed. Mr. Pope an&s;wer|ed his letter, and the civilities contained in it, by &s;ub&s;cribing for two &s;etts of his poems, and 'tis &s;aid he wrote to Mr. Banks the following compliment,
<Q><L>' May this put money in your pur&s;e:</L>
<L>' For, friend, believe me, I've &s;een wor&s;e.'</L></Q></P>
<P>The publication of the&s;e poems, while they, no doubt, enhanced his intere&s;t, added likewi&s;e &s;ome|thing to his reputation; and quitting his employ|ment at Mr. Montague's, he made an effort to live by writing only. He engaged in a large work in folio, entitled, The Life of Chri&s;t, which was very acceptable to the public, and was executed with much piety and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks's next pro&s;e work, of any con&s;iderable length, was A Critical Review of the Life of Oliver Cromwell. We have already taken notice that he received his education among the Anabapti&s;ts, and con&s;equently was attached to tho&s;e principles, and a favourer of that kind of con&s;titution which Cromwell, in the fir&s;t period of his power, meant to e&s;tabli&s;h. Of the many Lives of this great man, with which the biography of this nation has been augmented, perhaps not one is written with a true di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate candour. Men are divided in their &s;entiments concerning the mea&s;ures which, at that critical Aera,
<PB N="313" REF="318">
were pur&s;ued by contending factions. The writers, who have undertaken to review tho&s;e unhappy times, have rather &s;truggled to defend a party, to which they may have been &s;wayed by education or intere&s;t, than, by &s;tripping them&s;elves of all partiality, to dive to the bottom of contenti|ons in &s;earch of truth. The heats of the Ci|vil War produced &s;uch animo&s;ities, that the fervour which then prevailed, communicated it&s;elf to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;terity, and, though at the di&s;tance of a hundred years, has not yet &s;ub&s;ided. It will be no wonder then if Mr. Banks's Review is not &s;ound altoge|ther impartial. He has, in many ca&s;es, very &s;uc|ce&s;sfully defended Cromwell; he has yielded his conduct, in others, to the ju&s;t cen&s;ure of the world. But were a Whig and a Tory to read this book, the former would pronounce him a champion for liberty, and the latter would declare him a &s;ub|verter of truth, an enemy to monarchy, and a friend to that chaos which Oliver in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">roduced.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks, by his early principles, was, no doubt, bia&s;&s;ed to the Whig intere&s;t, and, perhaps, it may be true, that in tracing the actions of Cromwell, he may have dwelt with a kind of increa&s;ing plea&s;ure on the bright &s;ide of his character, and but &s;lightly hinted at tho&s;e facts on which the other party fa&s;ten, when they mean to traduce him as a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ricide and an u&s;urper. But &s;uppo&s;ing the allegation to be true, Mr. Banks, in this par|ticular, has only di&s;covered the common failing of humanity: prejudice and partiality being blemi&s;hes from which the mind of man, perhaps, can never be entirely purged.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of Mr. Banks's life, he was employed in writing two weekly news-papers, the Old England, and the We&s;tmin&s;ter Journals. Tho&s;e papers treated chiefly on the politics of the times, and the trade and navigation of England. They were carried on by our author, without of|fence
<PB N="314" REF="319">
to any party, with an hone&s;t regard to the public intere&s;t, and in the &s;ame kind of &s;pirit, that works of that &s;ort generally are. The&s;e papers are yet continued by other hands.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks had from nature very con&s;iderable abilities, and his poems de&s;ervedly hold the &s;econd rank. They are printed in two volumes 8vo. Be|&s;ides the poems contained in the&s;e volumes, there are &s;everal other poetical pieces of his &s;cattered in news-papers, and other periodical works to which he was an occa&s;ional contributer. He had the talent of relating a tale humorou&s;ly in ver&s;e, and his graver poems have both &s;orce of thinking, and elegance of numbers to recommend them.</P>
<P>Towards the &s;pring of the year 1751 Mr. Banks, who had long been in a very indifferent &s;tate of health, vi&s;ibly declined. His di&s;order was of a nervous &s;ort, which he bore with great pa|tience, and even with a chearful re&s;ignation. This &s;pring proved fatal to him; he died on the 19th of April at his hou&s;e at I&s;lington, where he had lived &s;everal years in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, by the produce of his pen, without leaving one enemy be|hind him.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks was a man of real good nature, of an ea&s;y benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, and his friends e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er e&s;teemed him as a mo&s;t agreeable com|panion. He had none of the petulance, which too frequentl renders men of genius unaccept|able to their acquaintance. He was of &s;o com|po&s;ed a temper, that he was &s;eldom known to be in a pa&s;&s;ion, and he wore a perpetual chearful|ne&s;s in his countenance. He was rather ba&s;hful, than forward; his addre&s;s did not qualify him for gay company, and though he po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed a very exten&s;ive knowledge of things, yet, as he had not
<PB N="315" REF="320">
much grace of delivery, or elegance of manner, he could not make &s;o good a figure in conver&s;ation, as many per&s;ons of le&s;s knowledge, with a happier appearance. Of all authors Mr. Banks was the farthe&s;t removed from envy or malevolence. As he could not bear the lea&s;t whi&s;per of detraction, &s;o he was never heard to expre&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s at the growing reputation of another; nor was he ever engaged in literary conte&s;ts. We &s;hall conclude this article in the words of lord Clarendon. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He that lives &s;uch a life, need be le&s;s anxious at how &s;hort warning it is taken from him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See lord Clarendon's character of the lord Falkland.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>Mrs. LAETITIA PILKINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS unfortunate poete&s;s, the circum&s;tances of who&s;e life, written by her&s;elf, have lately entertained the public, was born in the year 1712. She was the daughter of Dr. Van I ewen, a gen|tleman of Dutch extraction; who &s;ettled in Dublin. Her mother was de&s;cended of an ancient and ho|nourable family, who have frequently intermarried with the nobility.</P>
<P>Mrs. Pilkington, from her earlie&s;t infancy, had a &s;t ong di&s;po&s;ition to letters, and particularly to poetry. All her lei&s;ure hours were dedicated to the mu&s;es; from a reader &s;he quickly became a writer, and, as Mr. Pope expre&s;&s;es it,<Q><L>' She li&s;p'd in numbers, for the numbers came.'</L></Q></P>
<P>Her performances were con&s;idered as extraordi|nary for her years, and drew upon her the admi|ration
<PB N="316" REF="321">
of many, who found more plea&s;ure in her conver&s;ation, than that of girls generally affords. In con&s;equence of a poetical genius, and an en|gaging &s;prightline&s;s peculiar to her, &s;he had many wooers, &s;ome of whom &s;eriou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ed her, while others meant no more than the common gal|lantries of young people. After the u&s;ual ceremo|ny of a court&s;hip, &s;he became the wife of Mr. Matthew Pilkington, a gentleman in holy orders, and well known in the poetical world by his vo|lume of Mi&s;cellanies, revi&s;ed by dean Swift. As we have few materials for Mrs. Pilkington's life, be&s;ide tho&s;e furni&s;hed by her&s;elf in her Memoirs publi&s;hed in 1749, our readers mu&s;t depend upon her veracity for &s;ome facts which we may be obliged to mention, upon her &s;ole authority.</P>
<P>Our poete&s;s, &s;ays &s;he, had not been long married, e'er Mr. Pilkington became jealous, not of her per|&s;on, but her under&s;tanding. She was applauded by dean Swift, and many other per&s;ons of ta&s;te; every compliment that was paid her, gave a mor|tal &s;tab to his peace. Behold the difference between the lover and the hu&s;band! When Mr. Pilkington courted her, he was not more enamoured of her per&s;on, than her poetry, he &s;hewed her ver&s;es to every body in the enthu&s;ia&s;m of admiration; but now he was become a hu&s;band, it was a kind of trea&s;on for a wife to pretend to literary accom|pli&s;hments.</P>
<P>It is certainly true, that when a woman happens to have more under&s;tanding than her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;hould be very indu&s;trious to conceal it; but it is likewi&s;e true, that the natural vanity of the &s;ex is difficult to check, and the vanity of a poet &s;till more difficult: wit in a female mind can no more cea&s;e to &s;parkle, than &s;he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, can cea&s;e to &s;peak. Mr. Pilkington began to view her with &s;cornful, yet with jealous eyes, and in this &s;ituation, nothing but mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ry was likely to be their lot. While the&s;e jealou&s;ies &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, Mr. Pilking|ton,

contrary to the advice of his friends, went in|to England, in order to &s;erve as chaplain to al|derman Barber during his mayoralty of the city of London.</P>
<P>While he remained in London, and having the &s;trange humour of loving his wife be&s;t at a di|&s;tance, he wrote her a very kind letter, in which he informed her, that her ver&s;es were like her&s;elf, full of elegance and beauty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An extravagant compliment; for Mrs. Pilkington was far from being a beauty.</NOTE>; that Mr. Pope and others, to whom he had &s;hewn them, longed to &s;ee the writer, and that he heartily wi&s;hed her in Lon|don. This letter &s;et her heart on flame. London has very attractive charms to mo&s;t young people, and it cannot be much wondered at if Mrs. Pil|kington &s;hould take the only opportunity &s;he was ever likely to have, of gratifying her curio&s;ity: which however proved fatal to her; for though we cannot find, that during this vi&s;it to London, her conduct was the lea&s;t reproachable, yet, upon her return to Ireland; &s;he underwent a violent per&s;ecution of tongues. They who envied her abilities, fa&s;tened now upon her morals; they were indu&s;trious to trace the motives of her going to London; her behaviour while &s;he was there; and in&s;inuated &s;u&s;picions a|gain&s;t her cha&s;tity. The&s;e detracters were chiefly of her own &s;ex, who &s;upplied by the bittere&s;t ma|lice what they wanted in power.</P>
<P>Not long after this an accident happened, which threw Mrs. Pilkington's aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">irs into the utmo&s;t con|fu&s;ion. Her father was &s;tabbed, as &s;he has related, by an accident, but many people in Dublin be|lieve, by his own wife, though &s;ome &s;ay, by his own hand. Upon this melancholy occa&s;ion, Mrs. Pilkington has given an account of her father, which places her in a very amiable light. She di&s;covered for him the mo&s;t filial tender|ne&s;s; &s;he watched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound his bed, and &s;eems to have been the only relation then about him, who

de&s;erved his ble&s;&s;ing. From the death of her fa|ther her &s;ufferings begin, and the &s;ub&s;equent part of her life is a continued &s;eries of misfortunes.</P>
<P>Mr. Pilkington having now no expectation of a fortune by her, threw off all re&s;erve in his beha|viour to her. While Mrs. Pilkington was in the country for her health, his di&s;like of her &s;eems to have encrea&s;ed, and, perhaps, he re&s;olved to get rid of his wife at any rate: nor was he long wait|ing for an occa&s;ion of parting with her. The &s;tory of their &s;eparation may be found at large in her Memoirs. The &s;ub&s;tance is, that &s;he was &s;o indi&s;creet as to permit a gentleman to be found in her bed-chamber at an un&s;ea&s;onable hour; for which &s;he makes this apology. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Lovers of learn|ing I am &s;ure will pardon me, as I &s;olemnly de|clare, it was the attractive charms of a new book, which the gentleman would not lend me, but con&s;ented to &s;tay till I read it through, that was the &s;ole motive of my detaining him.'</Q> This indeed is a poor eva&s;ion; and as Mrs. Pilkington has &s;aid no more in favour of her innocence, they mu&s;t have great charity indeed with whom &s;he can &s;tand exculpated.</P>
<P>While the gentleman was with her, the &s;ervants let in twelve men at the kitchen window, who, though they might, as &s;he avers, have opened the chamber door, cho&s;e rather to break it to pieces, and took both her and the gentleman pri&s;oners. Her hu&s;band now told her, that &s;he mu&s;t turn out of doors; and taking hold of her hand, made a pre&s;ent of it to the gentleman, who could not in honour refu&s;e to take her, e&s;pecially as his own liberty was to be pro|cured upon no other terms. It being then two o'clock in the morning, and not knowing where to &s;teer, &s;he went home with her gallant: but &s;he &s;incerely a&s;&s;ures us, that neither of them entertain|ed a thought of any thing like love, but &s;at like &s;tatues 'till break of day.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="324">
The gentleman who was found with her, was obliged to fly, leaving a letter and five guineas in|clo&s;ed in it for her. She then took a lodging in &s;ome ob&s;cure &s;treet, where &s;he was per&s;ecuted by infamous women, who were panders to men of fortune.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Pilkington carried on a vi|gorous pro&s;ecution again&s;t her in the Spiritual Court; during which, as &s;he &s;ays, he &s;olemnly declared, he would allow her a maintainance, if &s;he never gave him any oppo&s;ition: but no &s;ooner had he obtained a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">paration, than he retracted every word he had &s;aid on that &s;ubject. Upon this &s;he was advi&s;ed to lodge an appeal, and as every one whom he con&s;ult|ed, a&s;&s;ured him he would be ca&s;t, he made a propo|&s;al of giving her a &s;mall annuity, and thirty pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of which, &s;he &s;ays, &s;he received only 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</NOTE> in money; which, in regard to her children, &s;he cho&s;e to accept, rather than ruin their father. She was with child at the time of her &s;eparatior, and when her labour came on, the woman where &s;he lodged in&s;i&s;ted upon doubling her rent: where|upon &s;he was obliged to write petitionary letters, which were not always &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the pains and peril of childbirth, &s;he begged of Mr. Pilkington to &s;end her &s;ome money to carry her to England; who, in hopes of getting rid of her, &s;ent her nine pounds. She was the more de&s;irous to leave Ireland, as &s;he found her character &s;inking every day with the public.

<P>When Mrs. Pilkington arrived in London, her conduct was the rever&s;e of what prudence would have dictated. She wanted to get into fa|vour with the great, and, for that purpo&s;e, took a lodging in St. James's &s;treet, at a guinea a week; upon no other pro&s;pect of living, than what might ari&s;e from &s;ome poems &s;he intended to pub|li&s;h by &s;ub&s;cription. In this place &s;he attracted the notice of the company frequenting White's Chocolate-Hou&s;e; and her &s;tory, by means of Mr. Cibber, was made known to per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, who, upon his recommendation, were kind to her.</P>
<P>Her acquaintance with Mr. Cibber began by a pre&s;ent &s;he made him of The Trial of Con&s;tancy, a poem of hers, which Mr. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d&s;ley publi&s;hed. Mr. Cibber, upon this, vi&s;ited her, and, ever after, with the mo&s;t unwearied zeal, promoted her in|tere&s;t. The reader cannot expect that we &s;hould &s;well this volume by a minute relation of all the incidents which happened to her, while &s;he con|tinued a poetical mendicant. She has not, with|out pride, related all the little tattle which pa&s;&s;ed between her and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, who,
<PB N="321" REF="326">
through the abundance of their idlene&s;s, thought proper to trifle an hour with her.</P>
<P>Her virtue &s;eems now to have been in a declin|ing &s;tate; at lea&s;t, her behaviour was &s;uch, that a man mu&s;t have extraordinary faith, who can think her innocent. She has told us, in the &s;econd volume of her Memoirs, that &s;he received from a noble per&s;on a pre&s;ent of fifty pounds. This, &s;he &s;ays, was the ordeal, or fiery trial; youth, beauty, no|bility of birth, attacking at once the mo&s;t de&s;olate per&s;on in the world. However, we find her &s;oon after this thrown into great di&s;tre&s;s, and making various applications to per&s;ons of di&s;tinction for &s;ub&s;criptions to her poems. Such as favoured her by &s;ub&s;cribing, &s;he had repaid with mo&s;t lavi&s;h en|comiums, and tho&s;e that withheld that proof of their bounty, &s;he has &s;acrificed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">her re&s;entment, by exhibiting them in the mo&s;t hideous light her imagination could form.</P>
<P>From the general account of her characters, this ob&s;ervation re&s;ults, That &s;uch as &s;he has &s;tigmatized for want of charity, ought rather to be cen|&s;ured for want of decency. There might be ma|ny rea&s;ons, why a per&s;on benevolent in his nature, might yet refu&s;e to &s;ub&s;eribe to her; but, in gene|ral, &s;uch as refu&s;ed, did it (as &s;he &s;ays) in a rude manner, and &s;he was more piqued at their defi|ciency in complai&s;ance to her, than their want of genero&s;ity. Complai&s;ance is ea&s;ily &s;hewn; it may be done without expence; it often procures admirers, and can never make an enemy. On the other hand, benevolence it&s;elf, accompanied with a bad grace, may lay us under obligations, but can never command our affection. It is &s;aid of King Charles I. that he be&s;towed his bounty with &s;o bad a grace, that he di&s;obliged more by giving, than his &s;on by refu&s;ing; and we have heard of a gentleman of great parts, who went to Newgate with a greater &s;atisfaction, as the judge who committed him accompanied the
<PB N="322" REF="327">
&s;entence with an apology and a compliment, than he received from his relea&s;ment by another, who, in extending the King's mercy to him, allayed the Roy|al clemency by &s;evere invectives again&s;t the gentle|man's conduct.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t avoid entering into a detail of the many addre&s;&s;es, di&s;appointments, and encourage|ments, which &s;he met with in her attendance up|on the great: her characters are naturally, &s;ome|times ju&s;tly, and often &s;trikingly, exhibited. The incidents of her life while &s;he remained in London were not very important, though &s;he has related them with all the advantage they can admit of. They are &s;uch as commonly happen to poets in di&s;tre&s;s, though it does not often fall out, that the in&s;olence of wealth meets with &s;uch a bold re|turn as this lady has given it. There is a &s;pirit of keenne&s;s, and freedom runs through her book, &s;he &s;pares no man becau&s;e he is great by his &s;ta|tion, or famous by his abilities. Some knowledge of the world may be gained from reading her Me|moirs; the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">fferent humours of mankind &s;he has &s;hewn to the life, and whatever was ridiculous in the characters &s;he met with, is expo&s;ed in very lively terms.</P>
<P>The next &s;cene which opens in Mrs. Pilking|ton's l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">fe, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;on of the Mar&s;hal&s;ea. The horrors and mi&s;enes of this jail &s;he has patheti|cally de&s;cribed, in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould affect the heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f every rigid creditor. In favour of her &s;ellow-pri&s;oners, &s;he wrote a very moving memo|rial, which, we are told, excited the legi&s;lative power to grant an Act of Grace for them. Af|ter our poete&s;s had remained nine weeks in this pri&s;on, the was at la&s;t relea&s;ed by the goodne&s;s of Mr. Cibber, from who&s;e repre&s;entation of her di&s;tre&s;s, no le&s;s than &s;ixteen dukes contributed a guinea apiece towards her enlargement. When this news was brought her, &s;he fainted away with exce&s;s of joy. Some time after &s;he had ta&s;ted li|berty,
<PB N="323" REF="328">
&s;he began to be weary of that continued attendance upon the great; and therefore was re|&s;olved, if ever &s;he was again favoured with a com|petent &s;um, to turn it into trade, and quit the precarious life of a poetical mendicant. Mr. Cib|ber had five guineas in re&s;erve for her, which, with ten more &s;he received from the duke of Marlborough, enabled her to take a &s;hop in St. James's Street, which &s;he filled with pamphlets and prints, as being a bu&s;ine&s;s better &s;uited to her ta&s;te and abilities, than any other. Her adventures, while &s;he remained a &s;hopkeeper, are not extreme|ly important. She has neglected to inform us how long &s;he continued behind the counter, but has told us, however, that by the liberality of her friends, and the bounty of her &s;ub&s;crib|ers, &s;he was &s;et above want, and that the autumn of her days was like to be &s;pent in peace and &s;erenity.</P>
<P>But whatever were her pro&s;pects, &s;he lived not long to enjoy the comforts of competence, for on the 29th of Augu&s;t, 1750, a few years after the publication of her &s;econd volume, &s;he died at Dublin, in the thirty ninth year of her age.</P>
<P>Con&s;idered as a writer, &s;he holds no mean rank. She was the author of The Turki&s;h Court, or The London Apprentice, acted at the theatre in Caple-&s;treet, Dublin, 1748, but never printed. This piece was poorly performed, otherwi&s;e it promi&s;ed to have given great &s;atisfac|tion. The fir&s;t act of her tragedy of the Roman Father, is no ill &s;pecimen of her talents that way, and throughout her Memoirs there are &s;cattered many beautiful little pieces, written with a true &s;pirit of poetry, though under all the di&s;advantages that wit can &s;uffer. Her memory &s;eems to have been amazingly great, of which her being able to re|peat almo&s;t all Shake&s;pear is an a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tance.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. THOMAS SOUTHERN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent poet was born in Dublin, on the year of the Re&s;toration of Charles the Ild, and received his early education at the univer&s;ity there. In the 18th year of his age, he quitted Ire|land, and as his intention was to pur&s;ue a lucrative profe&s;&s;ion, he entered him&s;elf in the Middle-Temple. But the natural vivacity of his mind overcoming con&s;iderations of advantage, he quitted that &s;tate of life, and entered into the more agreeable &s;ervice of the Mu&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jacob.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t dramatic performance of Mr. Southern, his Per&s;ian Prince, or Loyal Brother, was acted in the year 1682. The &s;tory is taken from Thamas Prince of Per&s;ia, a Novel; and the &s;cene is laid in I&s;pahan in Per&s;ia. This play was introduced at a time when the Tory intere&s;t was triamphant in Eng|land, and the character of the Loyal Brother was no doubt intended to compliment James Duke of York, who afterwards rewarded the poet for his &s;ervice. To this Tragedy Mr. Dryden wrote the Prologue and Epilogue, which furni&s;hed Mr. Southern with an opportunity of &s;aying in his dedi|cation, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the Laureat's own pen &s;ecured me, maintaining the out-works, while I lay &s;afe en|trenched within his lines; and malice, ill-nature, and cen&s;ure were forced to grin at a di&s;tance.'</Q></P>
<P>The Prologue is a continued invective again&s;t the Whigs, and whether con&s;idered as a party libel, or an induction to a new play, is in every re&s;pect un|worthy of the great hand that wrote it. His next
<PB N="327" REF="332">
play was a Comedy, called the Di&s;appointment, or the Mother in Fa&s;hion; performed in the year 1684.&mdash;After the acce&s;&s;ion of king James the IId to the throne, when the duke of Monmouth made an un|fortunate attempt upon his uncle's crown, Mr. Southern went into the army, in the regiment of foot rai&s;ed by the lord Ferrers, afterwards com|manded by the duke of Berwick; and he had three commi&s;&s;ions, viz. en&s;ign, lieutenant, and captain, under King James, in that regiment.</P>
<P>During the reign of this prince, in the year be|fore the Revolution, he wrote a Tragedy called the Spartan Dame, which however was not acted till the year 1721. The &s;ubject is taken from the Life of Agis in Plutarch, where the character of Chelonis, between the duties of a wife and daughter was thought to have a near re&s;emblance to that of King William's Queen Mary. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I began this play, &s;ays Mr. Southern, a year before the Revolution, and near four acts written without any view. Many things interfering with tho&s;e times, I laid by what I had written for &s;eventeen years: I &s;hewed it then to the late duke of Devon&s;hire, who was in every regard a judge; he told me he &s;aw no rea|&s;on why it might not have been acted the year of the Revolution: I then fini&s;hed it, and as I thought cut out the exceptionable parts, but could not get it acted, not being able to per&s;uade my&s;elf to the cutting off tho&s;e limbs, which I thought e&s;&s;ential to the &s;trength and life of it. But &s;ince I found it mu&s;t pine in ob&s;curity without it, I con&s;ented to the operation, and after the amputation of every line, very near to the number of 400, it &s;tands on its own legs &s;till, and by the favour of the town, and indulging a&s;&s;i&s;tance of friends, has come &s;uc|ce&s;sfully forward on the &s;tage.'</Q> This play was inimitably acted. Mr. Booth, Mr. Wilks, Mr. Cibber, Mr. Mills, &s;en. Mrs. Old&s;ield, and Mrs. Porter, all performed in it, in their heighth of re|putation, and the full vigour of their powers.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="333">
Mr. Southern acknowledges in his preface to this play, that the la&s;t &s;cene of the third Act, was al|mo&s;t all written by the honourable John Stafford, father to the earl of Stafford. Mr. Southern has like|wi&s;e acknowledged, that he received from the book|&s;eller, as a price for this play, 150 l. which at that time was very extraordinary. He was the fir&s;t who rai&s;ed the advantage of play writing to a &s;econd and third night, which Mr. Pope mentions in the fol|lowing manner,<Q><L>&mdash;Southern born to rai&s;e,</L>
<L>The price of Prologues and of Plays.</L></Q></P>
<P>The reputation which Mr. Dryden gained by the many Prologues he wrote, induced the players to be &s;ollicitous to have one of his to &s;peak, which were generally well received by the public. Mr. Dry|den's price for a Prologue had u&s;ually been five guineas, with which &s;um Mr. Southern pre&s;ented him when he received from him a Prologue for one of his plays. Mr. Dryden returned the money, and &s;aid to him; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Young man this is too little, I mu&s;t have ten guineas.'</Q> Mr. Southern on this ob&s;erv'd, that his u&s;ual price was five guineas. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Yes an|&s;wered Dryden, it has been &s;o, but the players have hitherto had my labours too cheap; for the future I mu&s;t have ten guineas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the information of a gentleman per&s;onally acquaint|ed with Mr. Southern, who de&s;ires to have his name conceal'd.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Southern was indu&s;trious to draw all imagin|able profits from his poetical labours. Mr. Dryden once took occa&s;ion to a&s;k him how much he got by one of his plays; to which he an&s;wered, that he was really a&s;hamed to inform him. But Mr. Dryden being a little importunate to know, he plainly told him, that by his la&s;t play he cleared &s;even hundred pounds; which appeared a&s;toni&s;hing to Mr. Dryden,

as he him&s;elf had never been able to acquire more than one hundred by any of his mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful pieces. The &s;ecret is, Mr. Southern was not be|neath the drudgery of &s;ollicitation, and often &s;old his tickets at a very high price, by making applica|tions to per&s;ons of di&s;tinction: a degree of &s;ervility which perhaps Mr. Dryden thought was much be|neath the dignity of a poet; and too much in the chara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ter of an under-player..</P>
<P>That Mr. Dryden entertained a very high, opinion of our author's abilities, appears from his many expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s towards him. He has prefixed a copy of ver&s;es to a Comedy of his, called the Wife's Excu&s;e, acted in the year 1692, with very indifferent &s;ucce&s;s: Of this Comedy, Mr. Dryden had &s;o high an opinion, that he bequeathed to our poet, the care of writing half the la&s;t act of his Tragedy of Cleomenes, <Q REND="inline">'Which, &s;ays Mr. Southern, when it comes into the world will appear to be &s;o con&s;iderable a tru&s;t, that all the town will pardon me for defending this play, that preferred me to it.'</Q></P>
<P>Our author continued from time to time to enter|tain the public with his dramatic pieces, the great|e&s;t part of which met with the &s;ucce&s;s they de&s;erved. The night on which his Innocent Adultery was fir&s;t acted, which is perhaps the mo&s;t moving play in any language; a gentleman took occa&s;ion to a&s;k Mr. Dryden, what was his opinion of Southern's genius? to which that great poet replied, <Q REND="inline">'That he thought him &s;uch another poet as Otway.'</Q> When this reply was communicated to Mr. Southern, he con&s;idered it as a very great compliment, having no ambition to be thought a more con&s;iderable poet than Otway was.</P>
<P>Of our author's Comedies, none are in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the &s;tage, nor perhaps de&s;erve to be &s;o; for in that province he is le&s;s excellent than in Tragedy. The pre&s;ent Laureat, who is perhaps

one of the be&s;t judges of Comedy now living, be|ing a&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d his opinion by a gentleman, of Southern's comic dialogue, an&s;wered, That it might be deno|minated Whip-Syllabub, that is, fla&s;hy and light, but indurable; and as it is without the Sal Atti|cum of wit, can never much delight the intelligent part of the audience.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t fini&s;hed, and the mo&s;t pathetic of Mr. Southern's plays, in the opinion of the critics, is his Oroonoko, or the Royal Slave. This drama is built upon a true &s;tory, related by Mrs. Behn, in a Novel; and has &s;o much the greater influence on the audience, as they are &s;en&s;ible that the repre&s;en|tation is no fiction. In this piece, Mr. Southern has touched the tender pa&s;&s;ions with &s;o much &s;kill, that it will perhaps be injurious to his memory to &s;ay of him, that he is &s;econd to Otway. Be&s;ides the ten|der and delicate &s;trokes of pa&s;&s;ion, there are many &s;hining and manly &s;entiments in Oroonoko; and one of the greate&s;t genius's of the pre&s;ent age, has often ob&s;erved, that in the mo&s;t celebrated play of Shake&s;pear, &s;o many &s;triking thoughts, and &s;uch a glow of animated poetry cannot be furni&s;hed. This play is &s;o often acted, and admired, that any illu&s;|tration of its beauties here, would be entirely &s;uper|fluous. His play of The Fatal Marriage, or The Innocent Adultery, met with de&s;erved &s;ucce&s;s; the affecting incidents, and intere&s;ting tale in the tra|gic part, &s;ufficiently compen&s;ate for the low, tri|fling, comic part; and when the character of I&s;a|bella is acted, as we have &s;een it, by Mrs. Por|ter, and Mrs. Wo&s;&s;ington, the ladies &s;eldom fail to &s;ympathi&s;e in grief.</P>
<P>Mr. Southern died on the 26th of May, in the year 1746, in the 86th year of his age; the latter part of which he &s;pent in a peaceful &s;erenity, hav|ing by his commi&s;&s;ion as a &s;oldier, and the profits of his dramatic works, acquired a hand&s;ome fortune; and being an exact oeconomi&s;t, he improved what

fortune he gained, to the be&s;t advantage: He en|joyed the longe&s;t life of all our poets, and died the riche&s;t of them, a very few excepted.</P>
<P>A gentleman who&s;e authority we have already quoted, had likewi&s;e informed us, that Mr. Southern lived for the la&s;t ten years of his life in We&s;tmin&s;ter, and attended very con&s;tant at divine &s;ervice in the Abbey, being particularly fond of church mu&s;ic.

<HEAD>The Revd. Mr. JAMES MILLER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was born in the year 1703. He was the &s;on of a clergyman, who po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed two con&s;iderable livings in Dor&s;et&s;hire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The account of this gentleman is taken from the informa|tion of his widow.</NOTE>. He re|cei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed his education at Wadham-College in Oxford, and while he was re&s;ident in that univer&s;ity he com|po&s;ed part of his famous Comedy called the Humours of Oxford, acted in the year 1729, by the particular recommendation of Mrs. Oldfield.</P>
<P>This piece, as it was a lively repre&s;entation of the follies and vices of the &s;tudents of that place, procured the author many enemies.</P>
<P>Mr. Miller was de&s;igned by his relations to be bred to bu&s;ine&s;s, which he declined, not being able to endure the &s;ervile drudgery it demanded. He no &s;ooner quitted the univer&s;ity than he entered into holy orders, and was immediately preferred to be lecturer in Trinity-College in Conduit-Street, and preacher of Roehampton-Chapel. The&s;e livings were too incon&s;iderable to afford a genteel &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, and therefore it may be &s;uppo&s;ed he had recour&s;e to dramatic writing to encrea&s;e his finan|ces. This kind of compo&s;ition, however, being reckoned by &s;ome very foreign to his profe&s;&s;ion, if not incon&s;i&s;tent with it, was thought to have re|tarded his preferment in the church. Mr. Miller was likewi&s;e attached to the High-Church intere&s;t, a circum&s;tance in the times in which he lived, not
<PB N="333" REF="338">
very favourable to preferment. He was &s;o hone&s;t however in the&s;e principles, that upon a large offer being made him by the agents for the mini&s;try in the time of a general oppo&s;ition, he had virtue &s;ufficient to with&s;tand the temptation, though his circum&s;tances at that time were far from being ea&s;y. Mr. Miller often confe&s;&s;ed to &s;ome of his friends, that this was the fiery trial of his con&s;tancy. He had received by his wife a very genteel fortune, and a tenderne&s;s for her had almo&s;t overcome his re&s;olutions; but he re|covered again to his former firmne&s;s, when upon hinting to his wife, the terms upon which prefer|ment might be procured, &s;he rejected them with in|dignation; and he became a&s;hamed of his own wavering. This was an in&s;tance of honour, few of which are to be met with in the Lives of the Poets, who have been too generally of a time-&s;erv|ing temper, and too pliant to all the follies and vices of their age. But though Mr. Miller would not purcha&s;e preferment upon the terms of writing for the mini&s;try, he was content to &s;tipulate, never to write again&s;t them, which propo&s;al they rejected in their turn.</P>
<P>About a year before Mr. Miller's death, which happened in 1743, he was pre&s;ented by Mr. Cary of Dor&s;et&s;hire, to the profitable living of Up&s;un, his father had before po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, but which this wor|thy man lived not long to enjoy; nor had he ever an opportunity of making that provi&s;ion for his family he &s;o much &s;ollicited; and which he even di&s;dained to do at the expence of his honour.</P>

Mr. Amhur&s;t's grandfather was a clergy|man, under who&s;e protection and care he received his education at Merchant-Taylors &s;chool. Hav|ing received there the rudiments of learning, he was removed to St. John's College, Oxford, from which, on account of the libertini&s;m of his prin|ciples, and &s;ome offence he gave to the head of that college, it appears, he was ejected.

<HEAD>Mr. GEORGE LILLO,</HEAD>
<P>WAS by profe&s;&s;ion a jeweller. He was born in London, on the 4th of Feb. 1693. He lived, as we are informed, near Moorgate, in the &s;ame neighbourhood where he received his birth, and where he was always e&s;teemed as a per&s;on of unblemi&s;hed character. 'Tis &s;aid, he was educated in the principles of the di&s;&s;enters: be that as it will, his morals brought no di&s;grace on any &s;ect or party. Indeed his principal attachment was to the mu&s;es.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t piece, brought on the &s;tage, was a Ballad Opera, called Sylvia; or, The Country Burial; performed at the Theatre Royal in Lincoln's-Inn Fields, but with no extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s, in the year 1730. The year following he brought his play, called The London Merchant; or, The True Story of George Barnwell, to Mr. Cibber junior, (then manager of the &s;ummer company, at the Theatre Royal in Drury-Lane) who originally played the part of Barnwell.&mdash;The author was
<PB N="339" REF="344">
not then known. As this was almo&s;t a new &s;pecies of tragedy, wrote on a very uncommon &s;ubject, he rather cho&s;e it &s;hould take its fate in the &s;ummer, than run the more hazardous fate of encountering the winter criticks. The old ballad of George Barnwell (on which the &s;tory was founded) was on this occa&s;ion reprinted, and many thou&s;ands &s;old in one day. Many gaily-di&s;po&s;ed &s;pirits brought the ballad with them to the play, intending to make their plea&s;ant remarks (as &s;ome afterwards owned) and ludicrous compari&s;ons between the an|tient ditty and the modern drama. But the play was very carefully got up, and univer&s;ally allowed to be well performed. The piece was thought to be well conducted, and the &s;ubject well managed, and the diction proper and natural; never low, and very rarely &s;welling above the characters that &s;poke. Mr. Pope, among other per&s;ons, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their rank, or particular publick merit, had the curio&s;ity to attend the performance, and commend|ed the actors, and the author; and remarked, if the latter had erred through the whole play, it was only in a few places, where he had unawares led him&s;elf into a poetical luxuriancy, affecting to be too elevated for the &s;implicity of the &s;ubject. But the play, in general, &s;poke &s;o much to the heart, that the gay per&s;ons before mentioned confe&s;&s;ed, they were drawn in to drop their ballads, and pull out their handkerchiefs. It met with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s; for it was acted above twenty times in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on to great audiences; was fre|quently be&s;poke by &s;ome eminent merchants and citizens, who much approved its moral tendency: and, in the winter following, was acted often to crowded hou&s;es: And all the royal family, at &s;e|veral different times, honoured it with their appear|ance. It gained reputation, and brought money to the poet, the managers, and the performers. Mr. Cibber, jun. not only gave the author his u&s;ual
<PB N="340" REF="345">
profits of his third days, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but procured him a benefit-night in the winter &s;ea&s;on, which turned out greatly to his advantage; &s;o that he had four benefit-nights in all for that piece; by the profits whereof, and his copy-money, he gained &s;everal hundred pounds. It continued a &s;tock-play in Drury-Lane Theatre till Mr. Cibber left that hou&s;e, and went to the Theatre in Covent-Garden. It was often acted in the Chri&s;tmas and Ea&s;ter holi|days, and judged a proper entertainment for the apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as being a more in&s;tructive, moral, and cautionary drama, than many pieces that had been u&s;ually exhibited on tho&s;e days, with little but farce and ribaldry to recommend them.</P>
<P>A few years after, he brought out his play of The Chri&s;tian Hero at the Theatre Royal in Drury-Lane.</P>
<P>And another Tragedy called Elmerick.</P>
<P>His tragedy of three acts, called Fatal Curio&s;ity, founded on an old Engli&s;h &s;tory, was acted with &s;ucce&s;s at the Hay-Market, in 1737.</P>
<P>He wrote another tragedy, never yet acted, called Arden of Fever&s;ham.</P>
<P>He was a man of &s;trict morals, great good-nature, and &s;ound &s;en&s;e, with an uncommon &s;hare of mo|de&s;ty.</P>

While he remained at that univer&s;ity, he became author of &s;everal poetical performances; &s;ome of which, in Latin, were &s;ufficiently elegant and pure, to intitle them to a place in the Mu&s;ae Anglicanae, publi&s;hed by Mr. Addi&s;on; an ho|nour &s;o much the more di&s;tingui&s;hed, as the purity of the Latin poems contained in that collection, furni&s;hed the fir&s;t-hint to Boileau of the greatne&s;s of the Briti&s;h genius. That celebrated critick of France entertained a mean opinion of the Engli&s;h poets, till he occa&s;ionally read the Mu&s;ae Angli|canae; and then he was per&s;uaded that they who could write with &s;o much elegance in a dead lan|guage, mu&s;t greatly excel in that which was na|tive to them.</P>
<P>Mr. Frowde has likewi&s;e obliged the publick with two tragedies; the Fall of Saguntum, dedi|cated to &s;ir Robert Walpole; and Philotas, ad|dre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="343" REF="348">
to the earl of Che&s;terfield. The fir&s;t of the&s;e performances, &s;o far as we are able to judge, has higher merit than the la&s;t. The &s;tory is more important, being the de&s;truction of a powerful city, than the fall of a &s;ingle hero; the incidents ri&s;ing out of this great event are likewi&s;e of a very intere&s;ting nature, and the &s;cenes in many places are not without pa&s;&s;ion, though ju&s;tly &s;ubject to a very general critici&s;m, that they are written with too little. Mr. Frowde has been indu&s;trious in this play to conclude his acts with &s;imiles, which how|ever exceptionable for being too long and tedious for the &s;ituations of the characters who utter them, yet are generally ju&s;t and beautiful. At the end of the fir&s;t act he has the following &s;imile upon &s;edition:<Q><L>Sedition, thou art up; and, in the ferment,</L>
<L>To what may not the madding populace,</L>
<L>Gathered together for they &s;carce know what,</L>
<L>Now loud proclaiming their late, whi&s;per'd grief,</L>
<L>Be wrought at length? Perhaps to yield the city.</L>
<L>Thus where the Alps their airy ridge extend,</L>
<L>Gently at fir&s;t the melting &s;nows de&s;cend;</L>
<L>From the broad &s;lopes, with murm'ring lap&s;e they glide</L>
<L>In &s;oft meanders, down the mountain's &s;ide;</L>
<L>But lower fall'n &s;treams, with each other cro&s;t,</L>
<L>From rock to rock impetuou&s;ly are to&s;t;</L>
<L>'Till in the Rhone's capacious bed they're lo&s;t.</L>
<L>United there, roll rapidly away,</L>
<L>And roaring, reach, o'er rugged rocks, the &s;ea.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the third act, the poet, by the mouth of a Roman hero, gives the following conci&s;e definition of true courage.<Q><L>True courage is not, where fermenting &s;pirits</L>
<L>Mount in a troubled and unruly &s;tream;</L>
<L>The &s;oul's its proper &s;eat; and rea&s;on there</L>
<L>Pre&s;iding, guides its cool or warmer motions.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="349">
The repre&s;entation of be&s;iegers driven back by the impetuo&s;ity of the inhabitants, after they had entered a gate of the city, is &s;trongly pictured by the following &s;imile.<Q><L>Imagine to thy&s;elf a &s;warm of bees</L>
<L>Driv'n to their hive by &s;ome impending &s;torm,</L>
<L>Which, at its little pe&s;t, in clu&s;tering heaps,</L>
<L>And climbing o'er each other's backs they enter.</L>
<L>Such was the people's flight, and &s;uch their ha&s;te</L>
<L>To gain the gate.</L></Q></P>
<P>We have ob&s;erved, that Mr. Frowde's other tra|gedy, called Philotas, was addre&s;&s;ed to the earl of Che&s;terfield; and in the dedication he takes care to inform his lord&s;hip, that it had obtained his pri|vate approbation, before it appeared on the &s;tage. At the time of its being acted, lord Che&s;terfield was then emba&s;&s;ador to the &s;tates-general, and con|&s;equently he was deprived of his patron's counte|nance during the repre&s;entation. As to the fate of this play, he informs his lord&s;hip, it was very par|ticular: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And I hope (&s;ays he) it will not be im|puted as vanity to me, when I explain my mean|ing in an expre&s;&s;ion of Juvenal, Laudatur &amp; al|get."</Q> But from what cau&s;e this misfortune at|tended it, we cannot take upon us to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Mr. Frowde died at his lodgings in Cecil-&s;treet in the Strand, on the 19th of Dec. 1738. In the London Daily Po&s;t 22d December, the following amiable character is given of our poet: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"But though the elegance of Mr. Frowde's writings has recommended him to the general publick e&s;teem, the politene&s;s of his genius is the lea&s;t amiable part of his character; for he e&s;teemed the talents of wit and learning, only as they were, conducive to the excitement and practice of honour and humanity. Therefore,
<PB N="345" REF="350">
with a &s;oul chearful, benevolent, and virtuous, he was in conver&s;ation genteelly delightful; in friend&s;hip punctually &s;incere; in death chri&s;tianly re&s;igned. No man could live more beloved; no private man could die more lamented."</P></Q></P>

<HEAD>Mrs. MARY CHANDLER,</HEAD>
<P>WAS born at Malm&s;bury in Wilt&s;hire, in the year 1687, of worthy and reputable pa|rents; her father, Mr. Henry Chandler, being mi|ni&s;ter, many years, of the congregation of prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters in Bath, who&s;e integrity, candour, and catholick &s;pirit, gained him the e&s;teem and friend|&s;hip of all ranks and parties. She was his elde&s;t daughter, and trained up carefully in the principles of religion and virtue. But as the circum&s;tances of the family rendered it nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould be brought up to bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he was very early employed in it, and incapable of receiving that polite and learned education which &s;he often regretted the lo&s;s of, and which &s;he afterwards endeavoured to repair by diligently reading, and carefully &s;tudying the be&s;t modern writers, and as many as &s;he could of the antient ones, e&s;pecially the poets, as far as the be&s;t tran&s;lations could a&s;&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e, Horace was her favourite; and how ju&s;t her &s;entiments were of that elegant writer, will fully appear from her own words, in a letter to an intimate friend, relating to him, in which &s;he thus expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have been reading Horace this month pa&s;t, in the be&s;t tran&s;lation I could procure of him. O could I read his fine &s;entiments cloathed in his own dre&s;s, what would I, what would I not give! He is more my fa|vourite
<PB N="346" REF="351">
than Virgil or Homer. I like his &s;ub|jects, his ea&s;y manner. It is nature within my view. He doth not lo&s;e me in fable, or in the clouds amid&s;t gods and godde&s;&s;es, who, more bruti&s;h than my&s;elf, demand my homage, nor hurry me into the noi&s;e and confu&s;ion of battles, nor carry me into inchanted circles, to conjure with witches in an unknown land, but places me with per&s;ons like my&s;elf, and in countries where every object is familiar to me. In &s;hort, his pre|cepts are plain, and morals intelligible, though not always &s;o perfect as one could have wi&s;hed them. But as to this, I con&s;ider when and where he lived."</Q></P>
<P>The hurries of life into which her circum&s;tances at Bath threw her, &s;at frequently extremely heavy upon a mind &s;o intirely devoted to books and con|templation as hers was; and as that city, e&s;pecially in the &s;ea&s;ons, but too often furni&s;hed her with cha|racters in her own &s;ex that were extremely di&s;plea&s;|ing to her, &s;he often, in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate man|ner, lamented her fate, that tied her down to &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;ituation; for &s;he was of &s;o extremely delicate and generous a &s;oul, that the impru|dences and faults of others gave her a very &s;en&s;i|ble pain, though &s;he had no other connexion with, or intere&s;t in them, but what aro&s;e from the com|mon ties of human nature. This made her occa|&s;ional retirements from that place to the country|&s;eats of &s;ome of her peculiarly intimate and ho|noured friends, doubly delightful to her, as &s;he there enjoyed the &s;olitude &s;he loved, and could conver&s;e, without interruption, with tho&s;e objects of nature, that never failed to in&s;pire her with the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite &s;atisfaction. One of her friends, whom &s;he highly honoured and loved, and of who&s;e ho&s;pitable hou&s;e, and plea&s;ant gardens, &s;he was allowed the free&s;t u&s;e, was the late excellent Mrs. Stephens, of Sodbury in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, who&s;e &s;eat &s;he cele|brated
<PB N="347" REF="352">
in a poem in&s;cribed to her, in&s;erted in the col|lection &s;he publi&s;hed. A lady, that was worthy of the highe&s;t commendation her mu&s;e could be&s;tow upon her. The fine u&s;e &s;he made of &s;olitude, the few fol|lowing lines &s;he wrote on it, will be an honourable te&s;timony to her.<Q><L>Sweet &s;olitude, the Mu&s;es dear delight,</L>
<L>Serene thy day, and peaceful is thy night!</L>
<L>Thou nur&s;e of innocence, fair virtue's friend,</L>
<L>Silent, tho' rapturous, plea&s;ures thee attend.</L>
<L>Earth's verdant &s;cenes, the all-&s;urrounding &s;kies</L>
<L>Employ my wondring thoughts, and fea&s;t my eyes</L>
<L>Nature in ev'ry object points the road,</L>
<L>Whence contemplation wings my &s;oul to God.</L>
<L>He's all in all. His wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, pow'r,</L>
<L>Spring in each blade, and bloom in ev'ry flow'r,</L>
<L>Smile o'er the meads, and bend in ev'ry hill,</L>
<L>Glide in the &s;tream, and murmur in the rill</L>
<L>All nature moves obedient to his will.</L>
<L>Heav'n &s;hakes, earth trembles, and the fore&s;ts nod,</L>
<L>When awful thunders &s;peak the voice of God.</L></Q></P>
<P>However, notwith&s;tanding her love of retirement, and the happy improvement &s;he knew how to make of it, yet her firm belief that her &s;tation was the appointment of providence, and her earne&s;t defire of being u&s;eful to her relations, whom &s;he regarded with the warme&s;t affection, brought her to &s;ubmit to the fatigues of her bu&s;ine&s;s, to which, during thirty-five years, &s;he applied her&s;elf with the utmo&s;t diligence and care.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t &s;uch perpetual avocations, and con&s;tant attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, her improvements in know|ledge, and her exten&s;ive acquaintance with the be&s;t writers, are truly &s;urpri&s;ing. But &s;he well knew the worth of time, and eagerly laid hold of all her lei&s;ure hours, not to lavi&s;h them away in fa|&s;hionable unmeaning amu&s;ements, but in the pur&s;uit
<PB N="348" REF="353">
of what &s;he valued infinitely more, tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial acqui&s;itions of true wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, which &s;he knew were the noble&s;t ornaments of the rea&s;on|able mind, and the only &s;ources of real and perma|nent happine&s;s: and &s;he was the more de&s;irous of this kind of accompli&s;hments, as &s;he had nothing in her &s;hape to recommend her, being grown, by an accident in her childhood, very irregular in her body, which &s;he had re&s;olution enough often to make the &s;ubject of her own plea&s;antry, drawing this wi&s;e inference from it, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That as her per&s;on would not recommend her, &s;he mu&s;t endeavour to cultivate her mind, to make her&s;elf agree|able."</Q></P>
<P>And indeed this &s;he did with the greate&s;t care; and &s;he had &s;o many excellent qualities in her, that though her fir&s;t appearance could never create any prejudice in her favour, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible to know her without valuing and e&s;teeming her.</P>
<P>Wherever &s;he profe&s;&s;ed friend&s;hip, it was &s;incere and cordial to the objects of it; and though &s;he admired whatever was excellent in them, and gave it the commendations it de&s;erved, yet &s;he was not blind to their faults, e&s;pecially if &s;uch as &s;he ap|prehended to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of integrity and virtue. As &s;he thought one of the noble&s;t advantages of real friend&s;hip, was the ren|dering it &s;erviceable mutually to correct, poli&s;h, and perfect the characters of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed it, and as &s;he was not di&s;plea&s;ed to be kindly admoni&s;hed her&s;elf for what her friends thought any little di&s;|advantage to her character, &s;o &s;he took the &s;ame liber|ty with others; but u&s;ed that liberty with &s;uch a re|markable propriety, tenderne&s;s, and politene&s;s, as made tho&s;e more &s;incerely e&s;teem her, with whom &s;he u&s;ed the greate&s;t freedom, and has lo&s;t her no intimacy but with one per&s;on, with whom, for par|ticular rea&s;ons, &s;he thought her&s;elf obliged to break off all corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="354">
Nor could one, who had &s;o perfect a veneration and love for religion and virtue, fail to make her own advantage of the admonitions and reproofs &s;he gave to others: and &s;he often expre&s;&s;ed a very great plea&s;ure, that the care &s;he had of tho&s;e young per|&s;ons, that were frequently committed to her friend|&s;hip, put her upon her guard, as to her own tem|per and conduct, and on a review of her own actions, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould any way give them a wrong example, or omit any thing that was really for their good. And if &s;he at any time reflected, that her behaviour to others had been wrong, &s;he, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and frankne&s;s, a&s;ked the pardon of tho&s;e &s;he had offended; as not daring to leave to their wrong con&s;truction any action of hers, le&s;t they &s;hould imagine that &s;he indulged to tho&s;e faults for which &s;he took the liberty of reproving them. Agreeable to this happy di&s;po&s;ition of mind, &s;he gave, in an off-hand manner, the following advice to an intimate friend, who had &s;everal children, whom &s;he de&s;ervedly honoured, and whom &s;he could not e&s;teem and love beyond his real merits.<Q><L>To virtue &s;trict, to merit kind,</L>
<L>With temper calm, to trifles blind,</L>
<L>Win them to mend the faults they &s;ee,</L>
<L>And copy prudent rules from thee,</L>
<L>Point to examples in their &s;ight,</L>
<L>T' avoid, and &s;corn, and to delight.</L>
<L>Then love of excellence in&s;pire,</L>
<L>By hope their emulation fire,</L>
<L>You'll gain in time your own de&s;ire.</L></Q></P>
<P>She u&s;ed frequently to complain of her&s;elf, as natu|rally eager, anxious, and peevi&s;h. But, by a con&s;tant cultivation of that benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, that was never inwrought in any heart in a &s;tronger and more prevailing manner than in hers, &s;he, in a good mea&s;ure, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t her&s;elf of tho&s;e inward &s;ources
<PB N="350" REF="355">
of unea&s;ine&s;s, and was plea&s;ed with the victory &s;he had gained over her&s;elf, and continually &s;triving to render it more ab&s;olute and complete.</P>
<P>Her religion was rational and prevalent. She had, in the former part of her life, great doubts about chri&s;tianity, during which &s;tate of uncertain|ty, &s;he was one of the mo&s;t unea&s;y and unhappy per&s;ons living. But her own good &s;en&s;e, her invio|lable attachment to religion and virtue, her impar|tial inquiries, her conver&s;e with her believing friends, her &s;tudy of the be&s;t writers in defence of chri&s;tia|nity, and the ob&s;ervations &s;he made on the temper and conduct, the fall and ruin of &s;ome that had di&s;carded their principles, and the irregularities of others, who never attended to them, fully at la&s;t re|lea&s;ed her from all her doubts, and made her a firm and e&s;tabli&s;hed chri&s;tian. The immediate con&s;e|quence of this was, the return of her peace, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her&s;elf, the enjoyment of her friends, and an intire freedom from the terror of any thing that could befall her in the future part of her exi&s;t|ence. Thus &s;he lived a plea&s;ure to all who knew her, and being, at length, re&s;olved to di&s;engage her&s;elf from the hurries of life, and wrap her&s;elf up in that retirement &s;he was &s;o fond of, after hav|ing gained what &s;he thought a &s;ufficient competency for one of her moderate de&s;ires, and in that &s;tation that was allotted her, and &s;ettled her affairs to her own mind, &s;he finally quitted the world, and in a manner agreeable to her own wi&s;hes, without being &s;uffered to lie long in weakne&s;s and pain, a burthen to her&s;elf, or tho&s;e who attended her: dying after about two days illne&s;s, in the 58th year of her age, Sept. 11, 1745.</P>
<P>She thought the di&s;advantages of her &s;hape were &s;uch, as gave her no rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of being happy in a married &s;tate, and therefore cho&s;e to continue &s;ingle. She had, however, an honourable offer from a country gentleman of worth and large
<PB N="351" REF="356">
fortune, who, attracted merely by the goodne&s;s of her character, took a journey of an hundred miles to vi&s;it her at Bath, where he made his addre&s;&s;es to her. But &s;he convinced him that &s;uch a match could neither be for his happine&s;s, or her own. She had, however, &s;omething extremely agreeable and plea&s;ing in her face, and no one could enter into any intimacy of conver&s;ation with her, but he immediately lo&s;t every di&s;gu&s;t towards her, that the fir&s;t appearance of her per&s;on tended to excite in him.</P>
<P>She had the misfortune of a very valetudinary con&s;titution, owing, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, probably to the irregularity of her form. At la&s;t, after many years illne&s;s, &s;he entered, by the late ingenious Dr. Cheney's advice, into the vegetable diet, and in|deed the utmo&s;t extremes of it, living frequently on bread and water; in which &s;he continued &s;o long, as rendered her incapable of taking any more &s;ub|&s;tantial food when &s;he afterwards needed it; for want of which &s;he was &s;o weak as not to be able to &s;upport the attack of her la&s;t di&s;order, and which, I doubt not, ha&s;tened on her death. But it mu&s;t be added, in ju&s;tice to her character, that the ill &s;tate of her health was not the only or principal rea&s;on that brought her to, and kept her fixed in her re&s;olution, of attempting, and per&s;evering in this mortifying diet. The conque&s;t of her&s;elf, and &s;ubjecting her own heart more intirely to the com|mand of her rea&s;on and principles, was the object &s;he had in e&s;pecial view in this change of her man|ner of living; as being firmly per&s;uaded, that the perpetual free u&s;e of animal food, and rich wines, tends &s;o to excite and inflame the pa&s;&s;ions, as &s;carce to leave any hope or chance, for that conque&s;t of them which &s;he thought not only religion requires, but the care of our own happine&s;s, renders nece&s;&s;ary. And the effect of the trial, in her own ca&s;e, was
<PB N="352" REF="357">
an&s;werable to her wi&s;hes; and what &s;he &s;ays of her|&s;elf in her own humorous epitaph,
<Q><HI>That time and much thought had all pa&s;&s;ion extingui&s;h'd,</HI></Q>
was well known to be true, by tho&s;e who were mo&s;t nearly acquainted with her. Tho&s;e admirable lines on <HI>Temperance,</HI> in her Bath poem, &s;he penned from a very feeling experience of what &s;he found by her own regard to it, and can never be read too often, as the &s;en&s;e is equal to the goodne&s;s of the poetry.<Q><L>Fatal effects of luxury and ea&s;e!</L>
<L>We drink our poi&s;on, and we eat di&s;ea&s;e,</L>
<L>Indulge our &s;en&s;es at our rea&s;on's co&s;t,</L>
<L>Till &s;en&s;e is pain, and rea&s;on hurt, or lo&s;t.</L>
<L>Not &s;o, O temperance bland! when rul'd by thee,</L>
<L>The brute's obedient, and the man is free.</L>
<L>Soft are his &s;lumbers, balmy is his re&s;t,</L>
<L>His veins not boiling from the midnight fea&s;t.</L>
<L>Touch'd by Aurora's ro&s;y hand, he wakes</L>
<L>Peaceful and calm, and with the world partakes,</L>
<L>The joyful dawnings of returning day,</L>
<L>For which their grateful thanks the whole crea|tion pay,</L>

<L>Who&s;e works of darkne&s;s fly the ri&s;ing &s;un.</L>
<L>'Tis to thy rules, O temperance, that we owe</L>
<L>All plea&s;ures, which from health and &s;trength can flow,</L>

<P>She was ob&s;erved, from her childhood, to have a fondne&s;s for poetry, often entertaining her com|panions,
<PB N="353" REF="358">
in a winter's evening, with riddles in ver&s;e, and was extremely fond, at that time of life, of Herbert's poems. And this di&s;po&s;ition grew up with her, and made her apply, in her riper years, to the &s;tudy of the be&s;t of our Engli&s;h poets; and be|&s;ore &s;he attempted any thing con&s;iderable, &s;ent many &s;mall copies of ver&s;es, on particular characters and occa&s;ions, to her peculiar friends. Her poem on the Bath had the full approbation of the publick; and what &s;ets it above cen&s;ure, had the commenda|tion of Mr. Pope, and many others of the fir&s;t rank, for good &s;en&s;e and politene&s;s. And indeed there are many lines in it admirably penn'd, and that the fine&s;t genius need not to be a&s;hamed of. It hath ran through &s;everal editions; and, when fir&s;t pub|li&s;hed, procured her the per&s;onal acknowledgments of &s;everal of the brighte&s;t quality, and of many others, greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed as the~ be&s;t judges of poetical performances.</P>
<P>She was meditating a nobler work, a large poem on the Being and Attributes of God, which was her favourite &s;ubject; and, if one may judge by the im|perfect pieces of it, which &s;he left behind her in her papers, would have drawn the publick attention, had &s;he liv'd to fini&s;h it.</P>
<P>She was peculiarly happy in her acquaintance, as &s;he had good &s;en&s;e enough to di&s;cern that worth in others &s;he ju&s;tly thought was the foundation of all real friend&s;hip, and was &s;o happy as to be honoured and loved as a friend, by tho&s;e whom &s;he would have wi&s;hed to be connected with in that &s;acred character. She had the e&s;teem of that mo&s;t excel|lent lady, who was &s;uperior to all commendation, the late dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et, then counte&s;s of Hert|ford, who hath done her the honour of &s;everal vi|&s;its, and allowed her to return them at the Mount of Marlborough. Mr. Pope favoured her with his at Bath, and complimented her for her poem on that place. Mrs. Rowe, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">room, was one of her

She was a good woman, a kind relation, and a &s;aithful friend. She had a real genius for poetry, was a mo&s;t agreeable corre&s;pondent, had a large fund of good &s;en&s;e, was unblemi&s;hed in her character, lived highly e&s;teemed, and died greatly lamented.</P>
