<TAILNOTE>
<P>&rindx; It is near three years &s;ince the above lines were written, and the Fir&s;t Part of THE MAID OF ARRAGON fini&s;hed; though other avocations have prevented the publication till now. This circum&s;tance is mentioned, to &s;hew that they were prompted by the heart, and not by the de&s;ire of imitating the Author of an admirable Novel, which was addre&s;&s;ed to a Father &s;ince that period.</P>

<HEAD>DEPRECATION.</HEAD>
<P>I ENTREAT the Reviewers to have compa&s;&s;ion on me. From the beginning of my literary warfare, the&s;e un|merciful Wits have pur&s;ued me with the &s;harpe&s;t arrows of Critici&s;m; and I have had nothing to con&s;ole me, alas!&mdash;but the approbation of the Public. How &s;hall I e&s;cape now, when to all my other faults are added, &s;o many out|rages in Geography? With what triumph of critical &s;aga|city will they &s;ay, (after the nece&s;&s;ary &s;trictures on the &s;tory, thoughts, and ver&s;es) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If our Author was determined to &s;end her Pega&s;us into <HI>Spain,</HI> in que&s;t of adventures, &s;he ought to have con&s;ulted <HI>Salmon</HI> about the &s;ituation of its provinces. She would there have found that <HI>Ar|ragon</HI> is fifty miles from the &s;ea; and that the <HI>Moors</HI> could not po&s;&s;ibly have debarked on its confines, unle&s;s, like fi&s;h to the <HI>London</HI> markets, their fleet had arrived by land-carriage. With equal facility, the troops of the King of <HI>Leon</HI> are brought acro&s;s <HI>Old Ca&s;tile</HI> to <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a</HI> in about thirty hours&mdash;another miracle; which was doubtle&s;s accompli&s;hed by the interpo&s;ition of a friendly necromancer, who furni&s;hed the army with wings, in exchange for &s;ome cha&s;te dam&s;el, or beautifull prince&s;s. Had this Lady-Writer's reading extended to a <HI>tran&s;lation</HI> of the Iliad, &s;he would have found no examples of &s;uch liberties there. <HI>Homer</HI> gives an exact map of the coun|tries he carries us through; and from <HI>Ithaca</HI> to <HI>Troy,</HI> not a village or river is mi&s;placed."</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="5">
True: but <HI>Homer</HI> (I name him as a modern Painter mentions a <HI>Correggio,</HI> and a <HI>Raphael</HI>) <HI>Homer</HI> united the Hi&s;torian with the Poet&mdash;I deal entirely in fiction. It was enough for me, that <HI>Spain,</HI> through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, had been &s;ubject to the ravages of <HI>Africa;</HI> and that during this period, &s;overeigns had been robbed of their crowns, and been obliged to re&s;ign their &s;ceptres to their &s;warthy conquerors. The relation of the particular events of the&s;e remote times, the Hi&s;toric Mu&s;e has generally left to her creative Si&s;ter, who never fails to profit by their ob&s;cu|rity, in relating them to the world in her own manner; the geography of the heart, and the hi&s;tory of the pa&s;&s;ions, are the only realities to which &s;he attends. If, in de&s;cribing <HI>the&s;e,</HI> I &s;hall be found deviating from the laws of Truth, and Nature, I &s;hall have failed in my intention; but I pro|te&s;t, if the <HI>cacoethes &s;cribendi</HI> &s;hould continue on me, or if I &s;hould ever wander again into the regions of Romance, I &s;hall treat oceans and provinces with as little ceremony as rivulets and meadows: I will avail my&s;elf of the e&s;tabli&s;hed privileges, and rai&s;e mountains, &s;eas, or kingdoms, in any part of the habitable globe that hits my fancy; or, if it &s;trikes me, build a temple to Dullne&s;s&mdash;in the chamber of a Reviewer.</P>

<L>Oh, hold! the cup with woe ETERNAL flows,</L>
<L><HI>More&mdash;more</HI> than <HI>Death</HI> the pois'nous juice be&s;tows!</L>
<L>In vain!&mdash;he drinks&mdash;and now the &s;earching fires</L>
<L>Ru&s;h through his veins, and writhing he expires!</L>
<L>No &s;orrowing <HI>friend,</HI> no <HI>&s;i&s;ter, parent,</HI> nigh,</L>
<L>To &s;ooth his pangs, or catch his parting &s;igh;</L>
<L>Alone, <HI>unknown,</HI> the Mu&s;es' darling dies,</L>
<L>And with the vulgar dead unnoted lies!</L>
<L>Bright Star of Genius!&mdash;torn from life and fame,</L>
<L>My tears, my ver&s;e, &s;hall con&s;ecrate thy name!</L>
