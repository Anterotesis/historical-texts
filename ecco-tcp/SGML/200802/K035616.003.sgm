<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. COMPARISONS.</HEAD>
<P>COMPARISONS, as ob&s;erved a|bove<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 8.</NOTE>, &s;erve two different pur|po&s;es: When addre&s;&s;ed to the un|der&s;tanding, their purpo&s;e is to in&s;truct; when to the heart, their purpo&s;e is to give plea&s;ure. With re&s;pect to the latter, a compari&s;on may be employ'd to produce various plea&s;ures by different means. Fir&s;t, by &s;ugge&s;ting &s;ome unu&s;ual

re&s;emblance or contra&s;t: &s;econd, by &s;et|ting an object in the &s;tronge&s;t light: third, by a&s;&s;ociating an object with others that are agreeable: fourth, by elevating an object: and, fifth, by depre&s;&s;ing it. And that compari&s;ons may produce various plea&s;ures by the&s;e different means, appears from what is &s;aid in the chapter above cited; and will be made &s;till more evident by examples, which &s;hall be given after premi&s;ing &s;ome general ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>An object of one &s;en&s;e cannot be compa|red to an object of another; for &s;uch ob|jects are totally &s;eparated from each other, and have no circum&s;tance in common to admit either re&s;emblance or contra&s;t. Ob|jects of hearing may be compared, as al&s;o of ta&s;te, and of touch. But the chief fund of compari&s;on are objects of &s;ight; becau&s;e, in writing or &s;peaking, things can only be compared in idea, and the ideas of vi&s;ible objects are by far more lively than tho&s;e of any other &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>It has no good effect to compare things by way of &s;imile that are of the &s;ame kind, nor to contra&s;t things of different kinds.
<PB N="5" REF="4">
The rea&s;on is given in the chapter cited a|bove; and the rea&s;on &s;hall be illu&s;trated by examples. The fir&s;t is a re&s;emblance in|&s;tituted betwixt two objects &s;o nearly rela|ted as to make little or no impre&s;&s;ion.
<Q><L>This ju&s;t rebuke inflam'd the Lycian crew,</L>
<L>They join, they thicken, and th' a&s;&s;ault renew;</L>
<L>Unmov'd th'embody'd Greeks their fury dare,</L>
<L>And fix'd &s;upport the weight of all the war;</L>
<L>Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian pow'rs,</L>
<L>Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian tow'rs.</L>
<L>As on the confines of adjoining grounds,</L>
<L>Two &s;tubborn &s;wains with blows di&s;pute their bounds;</L>
<L>They tugg, they &s;weat; but neither gain, nor yield,</L>
<L>One foot, one inch, of the contended field:</L>
<L>Thus ob&s;tinate to death, they fight, they fall;</L>
<L>Nor the&s;e can keep, nor tho&s;e can win the wall.</L>
<BIBL>Iliad, xii. 505.</BIBL></Q>
Another from Milton labours under the &s;ame defect. Speaking of the fallen angels &s;earching for mines of gold:
<Q><L>A numerous brigade ha&s;ten'd: as when bands</L>
<L>Of pioneers with &s;pade and pick-ax arm'd</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
Forerun the royal camp to trench a field</L>
<L>Or ca&s;t a rampart.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next &s;hall be of things contra&s;ted that are of different kinds.

<L>What, is my Richard both in &s;hape and mind</L>
<L>Transform'd and weak? Hath Bolingbroke de|pos'd</L>
<L>Thine intellect? Hath he been in thy heart?</L>
<L>The lion, dying, thru&s;teth forth his paw,</L>
<L>And wounds the earth, if nothing el&s;e, with rage</L>
<L>To be o'erpower'd: and wilt thou, pupil-like,</L>
<L>Take thy correction mildly, ki&s;s the rod,</L>
<L>And fawn on rage with ba&s;e humility?</L>
</SP><BIBL>Richard II. act 5. &s;c. 1.</BIBL></Q>
This compari&s;on has &s;carce any force. A man and a lion are of different &s;pecies; and there is no &s;uch re&s;emblance betwixt them in general, as to produce any &s;trong effect by contra&s;ting particular attributes or cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>A third general ob&s;ervation is, That ab|&s;tract terms can never be the &s;ubject of com|pari&s;on, otherwi&s;e than by being per&s;onified.
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Shake&s;pear compares adver&s;ity to a toad, and &s;lander to the bite of a crocodile; but in &s;uch compari&s;ons the&s;e ab&s;tract terms mu&s;t be imagined &s;en&s;ible beings.</P>
<P>I now proceed to illu&s;trate by particular in&s;tances the different means by which compari&s;on can afford plea&s;ure; and, in the order above e&s;tabli&s;hed, I &s;hall begin with tho&s;e in&s;tances that are agreeable by &s;ugge&s;ting &s;ome unu&s;ual re&s;emblance or contra&s;t:

<P>None of the foregoing &s;imiles, as it ap|pears to me, have the effect to add any lu&s;tre to the principal &s;ubject; and there|fore the plea&s;ure they afford, mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;ugge&s;ting re&s;emblances that are not obvious: I mean the chief plea&s;ure; for undoubtedly a beautiful &s;ubject introduced to form the &s;imile affords a &s;eparate plea|&s;ure, which is felt in the &s;imiles mentioned, particularly in that cited from Milton.</P>
<P>The next effect of a compari&s;on in the

order mentioned, is to place an object in a &s;trong point of view; which I think is done &s;en&s;ibly in the following &s;imiles.

As words convey but a faint and ob&s;cure notion of great numbers, a poet, to give a high notion of the object he de&s;cribes with regard to number, does well to compare it to what is familiar and commonly known. Thus Homer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 2. l. 111.</NOTE> compares the Grecian army in point of number to a &s;warm of bees. In another pa&s;&s;age<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book 2. l. 551.</NOTE> he compares it to that profu&s;ion of leaves and flowers which appear in the &s;pring, or of in&s;ects in a &s;ummer's evening.

With regard to &s;imiles of this kind, it will readily occur to the reader, that when the re|&s;embling &s;ubject or circum&s;tance is once pro|perly introduced in a &s;imile, the mind pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily to the new objects, and is tran&s;itorily amu&s;ed with them, without feeling any di&s;|gu&s;t at the &s;light interruption. Thus, in fine weather, the momentary excur&s;ions of

A compari&s;on by contra&s;t may contribute to grandeur or elevation, not le&s;s than by re&s;emblance; of which the following com|pari&s;on of Lucan is a remarkable in&s;tance.

Con&s;idering that the Heathen deities po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a rank but one degree above that of mankind, I think it &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, by a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion, to elevate or dignify more one of the human &s;pecies, than is done by this compari&s;on. I am &s;en&s;i|ble, at the &s;ame time, that &s;uch a compa|ri&s;on among Chri&s;tians, who entertain ju&s;ter notions of the Deity, would ju&s;tly be rec|koned extravagant and ab&s;urd.</P>

In the &s;ame view, Homer, I think, may be defended, in comparing the &s;houts of the Trojans in battle, to the noi&s;e of cranes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beginning of book 3.</NOTE>, and to the bleating of a flock of &s;heep<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book 4. l. 498.</NOTE>: and it is no objection, that the&s;e are low i|mages; for by oppo&s;ing the noi&s;y march of the Trojans to the &s;ilent and manly march of the Greeks, he certainly intended to le&s;&s;en the former. Addi&s;on<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Guardian No. 153.</NOTE>, imagining the figure that men make in the &s;ight of a &s;uperior being, takes opportunity to mor|tify
<PB N="25" REF="24">
their pride by comparing them to a &s;warm of pi&s;mires.</P>
<P>A compari&s;on that has none of the good effects mentioned in this di&s;cour&s;e, but is built upon common and trifling circum&s;tan|ces, makes a mighty &s;illy figure: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Non &s;um ne&s;cius, grandia con&s;ilia a multis plerumque cau&s;is, ceu magna navigia a plurimis remis, impelli<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strada de bello Belgico.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>By this time I imagine the different pur|po&s;es of compari&s;on, and the various im|pre&s;&s;ions it makes on the mind, are &s;uffi|ciently illu&s;trated by proper examples. This was an ea&s;y work. It is more difficult to lay down rules about the propriety or impro|priety of compari&s;ons; in what circum&s;tances they may be introduced, and in what circum|&s;tances they are out of place. It is evident, that a compari&s;on is not proper upon every occa&s;ion; a man in his cool and &s;edate moments, is not di&s;po&s;ed to poetical flights, nor to &s;acrifice truth and reality to the delu|&s;ive operations of the imagination; far le&s;s is he &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, when oppre&s;&s;ed with cares, or intere&s;ted in &s;ome important tran&s;action
<PB N="26" REF="25">
that occupies him totally. The region of compari&s;on and of all figurative expre&s;&s;ion, lies betwixt the&s;e two extremes. It is ob|&s;ervable, that a man, when elevated or ani|mated by any pa&s;&s;ion, is di&s;po&s;ed to elevate or animate all his objects: he avoids familiar names, exalts objects by circumlocution and metaphor, and gives even life and voluntary action to inanimate beings. In this warmth of mind, the highe&s;t poetical flights are in|dulged, and the bolde&s;t &s;imiles and meta|phors reli&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is accordingly ob&s;erved by Longinus, in his treati&s;e of the Sublime, that the proper time for metaphor, is when the pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o &s;welled as to hurry on like a torrent.</NOTE>. But without &s;oaring &s;o high, the mind is frequently in a tone to reli&s;h cha&s;te and moderate ornament; &s;uch as compari&s;ons that &s;et the principal object in a &s;trong point of view, or that embelli&s;h and diver&s;ify the narration. In general, when by any animating pa&s;&s;ion, whether plea&s;ant or painful, an impul&s;e is given to the imagination; we are in that condition wonderfully di&s;po&s;ed to every &s;ort of figu|rative expre&s;&s;ion, and in particular to com|pari&s;ons.
<PB N="27" REF="26">
This in a great mea&s;ure is evident from the compari&s;ons already mentioned; and &s;hall be further illu&s;trated by other ex|amples. Love, for example, in its infancy, rou&s;ing the imagination, prompts the heart to di&s;play it&s;elf in figurative language, and in &s;imiles:

The latter of the two &s;imiles is good. The former, becau&s;e of the faintne&s;s of the re|&s;emblance, produces no good effect, and crowds the narration with an u&s;ele&s;s image.</P>
<P>The next error I &s;hall mention is a capi|tal one. In an epic poem, or in any ele|vated &s;ubject, a writer ought to avoid rai|&s;ing a &s;imile upon a low image, which ne|ver fails to bring down the principal &s;ubject. In general, it is a rule, that a grand object ought never to be re&s;embled to one that is diminutive, however delicate the re&s;em|blance may be. It is the peculiar character
<PB N="37" REF="36">
of a grand object to fix the attention, and &s;well the mind: in this &s;tate, it is di&s;agree|able to contract the mind to a minute ob|ject, however elegant. The re&s;embling an object to one that is greater, has, on the contrary, a good effect, by rai&s;ing or &s;well|ing the mind. One pa&s;&s;es with &s;atisfaction from a &s;mall to a great object; but cannot be drawn down, without reluctance, from great to &s;mall. Hence the following &s;imi|les are faulty.

<P>The &s;tronge&s;t objection that can lie a|gain&s;t a compari&s;on, is, that it con&s;i&s;ts in words only, not in &s;en&s;e. Such fal&s;e coin, or ba&s;tard wit, does extremely well in bur|le&s;que; but is far below the dignity of the epic, or of any &s;erious compo&s;ition:

There is evidently no re&s;emblance betwixt an i&s;icle and a woman, cha&s;te or uncha&s;te.

Such phantom &s;imiles are mere wittici&s;ms, which ought to have no quarter, except where purpo&s;ely introduced to provoke laughter. Lucian, in his di&s;&s;ertation upon hi&s;tory, talking of a certain author, makes the following compari&s;on, which is verbal merely.

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. FIGURES.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader mu&s;t not expect to find here a complete li&s;t of the different tropes and figures that have been carefully noted by ancient critics and gram|marians. Tropes and figures have indeed been multiplied with &s;o little re&s;erve, as to make it no ea&s;y matter to di&s;tingui&s;h them from plain language. A di&s;covery al|mo&s;t accidental, made me think of giving them a place in this work: I found that the mo&s;t important of them depend on principles formerly explained; and I was glad of an opportunity to &s;how the exten|&s;ive influence of the&s;e principles. Con|fining my&s;elf therefore to figures that an|&s;wer this purpo&s;e, I am luckily freed from much tra&s;h; without dropping, &s;o far as I remember, any figure that merits a proper
<PB N="54" REF="53">
name. And I begin with Pro&s;opopoeia or per&s;onification, which is ju&s;ty intitled to the fir&s;t place.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. PERSONIFICATION.</HEAD>
<P>THis figure, which gives life to things in|animate, is &s;o bold a delu&s;ion as to re|quire, one &s;hould imagine, very peculiar cir|cum&s;tances for operating the effect. And yet, in the language of poetry, we find variety of expre&s;&s;ions, which, though commonly reduced to this figure, are u&s;ed without ceremony or any &s;ort of preparation. I give, for example, the following expre&s;&s;ions. <HI>Thir&s;ty</HI> ground, <HI>hungry</HI> church-yard, <HI>furious</HI> dart, <HI>angry</HI> ocean. The epithets here, in their proper meaning, are attributes of &s;en|&s;ible beings. What is the effect of &s;uch epithets, when apply'd to things inani|mate? Do they rai&s;e in the mind of the reader a perception of &s;en&s;ibility? Do they
<PB N="55" REF="54">
make him conceive the ground, the church-yard, the dart, the ocean, to be endued with animal functions? This is a curious inquiry; and whether &s;o or not, it cannot be declined in handling the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>One thing is certain, that the mind is prone to be&s;tow &s;en&s;ibility upon things ina|nimate, where that violent effect is nece&s;&s;ary to gratify pa&s;&s;ion. This is one in&s;tance, a|mong many, of the power of pa&s;&s;ion to adju&s;t our opinions and belief to its grati|fication<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 5.</NOTE>. I give the following examples. Antony, mourning over the body of Cae|&s;ar, murdered in the &s;enate-hou&s;e, vents his pa&s;&s;ion in the following words.
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Antony.</SPEAKER>
<L>O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</L>

Nor will it appear &s;trange, after what is &s;aid in the chapter above cited, that pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould have &s;uch power over the mind of man. Another example of the &s;ame kind is, where the earth, as a common mother, is animated to give refuge again&s;t a father's unkindne&s;s.<Q><SP>

<P>Plaintive pa&s;&s;ions are extremely &s;olicitous for vent. A &s;oliloquy commonly an&s;wers

the purpo&s;e. But when a pa&s;&s;ion &s;wells high, it is not &s;atisfied with &s;o &s;light a gra|tification: it mu&s;t have a per&s;on to com|plain to; and if none be found, it will ani|mate things devoid of &s;en&s;e. Thus Philoc|tetes complains to the rocks and promonto|ries of the i&s;le of Lemnos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philoctetes of Sophocles, act 4. &s;c. 2.</NOTE>; and Alce&s;tes dying, invokes the &s;un, the light of day, the clouds, the earth, her hu&s;band's palace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Alce&s;tes of Euripides, act 2. &s;c. 1.</NOTE>. Plaintive pa&s;&s;ions carry the mind &s;till farther.

This &s;ocial principle, when inflamed by a plaintive pa&s;&s;ion, will, for want of a more complete gratification, prompt the mind to give life even to things inanimate.

<P>I have been profu&s;e of examples, to &s;how what power many pa&s;&s;ions have to animate their objects. In all the foregoing exam|ples, the per&s;onification, if I mi&s;take not, is &s;o complete as to be derived from an ac|tual conviction, momentary indeed, of life and intelligence. But it is evident from numberle&s;s in&s;tances, that per&s;onification is not always &s;o complete. Per&s;onification is a common figure in de&s;criptive poetry, un|der&s;tood to be the language of the writer, and not of any of his per&s;onages in a fit of pa&s;&s;ion. In this ca&s;e, it &s;eldom or never comes up to a conviction, even momenta|ry, of life and intelligence. I give the fol|lowing examples.

It may, I pre&s;ume, be taken for granted, that, in the foregoing in&s;tances, the per&s;o|nification, either with the poet or his read|er, amounts not to a conviction of intelli|gence; nor that the &s;un, the moon, the
<PB N="64" REF="63">
day, the morn, are here under&s;tood to be &s;en&s;ible beings. What then is the nature of this per&s;onification? Upon con&s;idering the matter attentively, I di&s;cover that this &s;pecies of per&s;onification mu&s;t be referred to the imagination. The inanimate object is imagined to be a &s;en&s;ible being, but without any conviction, even for a moment, that it really is &s;o. Ideas or fictions of i|magination have power to rai&s;e emotions in the mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See appendix, containing definitions and explanation of terms.</NOTE>; and when any thing inanimate is, in imagination, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;en&s;ible being, it makes by that means a greater fi|gure than when an idea is formed of it ac|cording to truth. The elevation however in this ca&s;e, is far from being &s;o great as when the per&s;onification ari&s;es to an actual conviction; and therefore mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered as of a lower or inferior &s;ort. Thus per&s;onification is of two kinds. The fir&s;t or nobler, may be termed <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;oni|fication:</HI> the other, or more humble, <HI>de|&s;criptive per&s;onification;</HI> becau&s;e &s;eldom or
<PB N="65" REF="64">
never is per&s;onification in a de&s;cription car|ried the length of conviction.</P>
<P>The imagination is &s;o lively and active, that its images are rai&s;ed with very little ef|fort; and this ju&s;tifies the frequent u&s;e of de&s;criptive per&s;onification. This figure a|bounds in Milton's <HI>Allegro</HI> and <HI>Pen&s;ero&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>Ab&s;tract and general terms, as well as particular objects, are often nece&s;&s;ary in poetry. Such terms however are not well adapted to poetry, becau&s;e they &s;ugge&s;t not any image to the mind: I can readily form an image of Alexander or Achilles in wrath; but I cannot form an image of wrath in the ab&s;tract, or of wrath inde|pendent of a per&s;on. Upon that account, in works addre&s;&s;ed to the imagination, ab|&s;tract terms are frequently per&s;onified. But this per&s;onification never goes farther than the imagination.

I &s;hall add one example more, to &s;how that de&s;criptive per&s;onification may be u&s;ed with propriety, even where the purpo&s;e of the di&s;cour&s;e is in&s;truction merely:

<P>Hitherto our progre&s;s has been upon firm ground. Whether we &s;hall be &s;o lucky in the remaining part of the journey, &s;eems doubtful. For after acquiring &s;ome knowledge of the &s;ubject, when we now look back to the expre&s;&s;ions mentioned in the beginning, <HI>thir&s;ty</HI> ground, <HI>furious</HI> dart, and &s;uch like, it &s;eems as difficult as at fir&s;t to &s;ay what &s;ort of per&s;onification it is. Such expre&s;&s;ions evidently rai&s;e not the &s;lighte&s;t conviction of &s;en&s;ibility. Nor do I think they amount to de&s;criptive per&s;onifi|cation: in the expre&s;&s;ions mentioned, we do not &s;o much as figure the ground or the
<PB N="70" REF="69">
dart to be animated; and if &s;o, they cannot at all come under the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. And to &s;how this more clearly, I &s;hall endeavour to explain what effect &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions have naturally upon the mind. In the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>angry ocean,</HI> for example, do we not ta|citly compare the ocean in a &s;torm, to a man in wrath? It is by this tacit compa|ri&s;on, that the expre&s;&s;ion acquires a force or elevation, beyond what is found when an epithet is u&s;ed proper to the object: for I have had occa&s;ion to &s;how<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 19.</NOTE>, that a thing inanimate acquires a certain elevation by being compared to a &s;en&s;ible being. And this very compari&s;on is it&s;elf a demon&s;tration, that there is no per&s;onification in &s;uch expre&s;|&s;ions. For, by the very nature of a com|pari&s;on, the things compared are kept di&s;|tinct, and the native appearance of each is pre&s;erved. It will be &s;hown afterward, that expre&s;&s;ions of this kind belong to ano|ther figure, which I term <HI>a figure of &s;peech,</HI> and which employs the &s;eventh &s;ection of the pre&s;ent chapter.</P>

Though thus in general we can preci&s;ely di&s;tingui&s;h de&s;criptive per&s;onification from what is merely a figure of &s;peech, it is however often difficult to &s;ay, with re&s;pect to &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, whether they are of the one kind or of the other. Take the following in&s;tances.

With re&s;pect to the&s;e and numberle&s;s other in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind, whether they be examples of per&s;onification or of a fi|gure of &s;peech merely, &s;eems to be an ar|bitrary que&s;tion. They will be ranged un|der the former cla&s;s by tho&s;e only who are endued with a &s;prightly imagination.

<P>Having thus at large explained the pre|&s;ent figure, its different kinds, and the prin|ciples from whence derived; what comes next in order is to a&s;certain its proper pro|vince, by &s;howing in what ca&s;es it is &s;uita|ble, in what un&s;uitable. I begin with ob&s;erving, upon pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;onification, that this figure is not promoted by every pa&s;&s;ion indifferently. All di&s;piriting pa&s;&s;ions are aver&s;e to it. Remor&s;e, in particular, is too &s;erious and &s;evere, to be gratified by
<PB N="73" REF="72">
a phantom of the mind. I cannot therefore approve the following &s;peech of Enobarbus, who had de&s;erted his ma&s;ter Antony.

<P>Secondly, After a pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;onifica|tion is properly introduced, it ought to be confined &s;trictly to its proper province, that of gratifying the pa&s;&s;ion; and no &s;entiment nor action ought to be exerted by the ani|mated object, but what an&s;wers that pur|po&s;e. Per&s;onification is at any rate a bold figure, and ought to be employed with great re&s;erve. The pa&s;&s;ion of love, for ex|ample,
<PB N="74" REF="73">
in a plaintive tone, may give a mo|mentary life to woods and rocks, that the lover may vent his di&s;tre&s;s to them: but no pa&s;&s;ion will &s;upport a conviction &s;o far &s;tretched, as that the&s;e woods and rocks &s;hould be living witne&s;&s;es to report the di|&s;tre&s;s to others:

<P>Next comes de&s;criptive per&s;onification; upon which I mu&s;t ob&s;erve in general, that
<PB N="76" REF="75">
it ought to be cautiou&s;ly u&s;ed. A per&s;on|age in a tragedy, agitated by a &s;trong pa&s;|&s;ion, deals in &s;trong &s;entiments; and the reader, catching fire by &s;ympathy, reli&s;hes the bolde&s;t per&s;onifications. But a writer, even in the mo&s;t lively de&s;cription, ought to take a lower flight, and content him&s;elf with &s;uch ea&s;y per&s;onifications as agree with the tone of mind in&s;pired by the de&s;cription. In plain narrative, again, the mind, &s;erious and &s;edate, rejects per&s;onification altoge|ther. Strada, in his hi&s;tory of the Belgic wars, has the following pa&s;&s;age, which, by a &s;trained elevation above the tone of the &s;ubject, deviates into burle&s;k. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vix de|&s;cenderat a praetoria navi Cae&s;ar; cum foeda illico exorta in portu tempe&s;tas, cla&s;&s;em impetu disjecit, praetoriam hau|&s;it: qua&s;i non vecturam amplius Cae&s;a|rem, Cae&s;ari&s;que fortunam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dec. 1. l. 1.</NOTE>."</Q> Neither do I approve, in Shake&s;pear, the &s;peech of King John, gravely exhorting the citizens of Angiers to a &s;urrender; though a tragic writer has much greater latitude than a hi|&s;torian.

<P>Secondly, If extraordinary marks of re|&s;pect put upon a per&s;on of the lowe&s;t rank be ridiculous, not le&s;s &s;o is the per&s;onifica|tion of a mean object. This rule chiefly regards de&s;criptive per&s;onification: for an object can hardly be mean that is the cau&s;e of a violent pa&s;&s;ion; in that circum&s;tance, at lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be an object of importance. With re&s;pect to this point, it would be in vain to &s;et limits to per&s;onification: ta&s;te is the only rule. A poet of &s;uperior genius hath more than others the command of this figure; becau&s;e he hath more than o|thers the power of inflaming the mind. Homer appears not extravagant in anima|ting his darts and arrows: nor Thom&s;on in animating the &s;ea&s;ons, the winds, the rains, the dews. He even ventures to animate the diamond, and doth it with propriety.
<Q><PB N="78" REF="77">

<L>Dares, as it &s;parkles on the fair-one's brea&s;t,</L>
<L>With vain ambition emulate her eyes.</L></Q>
But there are things familiar and ba&s;e, to which per&s;onification cannot de&s;cend. In a compo&s;ed &s;tate of mind, to animate a lump of matter even in the mo&s;t rapid flight of fancy, degenerates into burle&s;k.

The per&s;onification here of a hand is in|&s;ufferable, e&s;pecially in a plain narration; not to mention that &s;uch a trivial incident is too minutely de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to ab|&s;tract terms, which ought not to be anima|ted unle&s;s they have &s;ome natural dignity. Thom&s;on, in this article, is quite licentious. Witne&s;s the following in&s;tances out of many.

<P>Thirdly, it is not &s;ufficient to avoid im|proper &s;ubjects. Some preparation is nece&s;|&s;ary, in order to rouze the mind. The i|magination

refu&s;es its aid, till it be warmed at lea&s;t, if not inflamed. Yet Thom&s;on, without the lea&s;t ceremony or preparation, introduceth each &s;ea&s;on as a &s;en&s;ible being:

<P>Fourthly, De&s;criptive per&s;onification ought never to be carried farther than barely to a|nimate the &s;ubject: and yet poets are not ea&s;ily re&s;trained from making this phantom of their own creating behave and act in every re&s;pect as if it were really a &s;en&s;ible

<HEAD>SECT. III. HYPERBOLE.</HEAD>
<P>IN this figure we have another effect of the foregoing principle. An object un|common with re&s;pect to &s;ize, either very great of its kind or very little, &s;trikes us with &s;urpri&s;e; and this emotion, like all others, prone to gratification, forces upon the mind a momentary conviction that the object is greater or le&s;s than it is in reality. The &s;ame effect, preci&s;ely, attends figura|tive grandeur or littlene&s;s. Every object that produceth &s;urpri&s;e by its &s;ingularity, is always &s;een in a fal&s;e light while the emo|tion &s;ub&s;i&s;ts: circum&s;tances are exaggera|ted beyond truth; and it is not till after the emotion &s;ub&s;ides, that things appear as they are. A writer, taking advantage of this
<PB N="90" REF="89">
natural delu&s;ion, enriches his de&s;cription greatly by the hyperbole. And the read|er, even in his coole&s;t moments, reli&s;hes this figure, being &s;en&s;ible that it is the ope|ration of nature upon a warm fancy.</P>
<P>It will be ob&s;erved, that a writer is gene|rally more &s;ucce&s;sful in magnifying by a hyperbole than in dimini&s;hing: a minute object contracts the mind, and fetters its power of conception; but the mind, dila|ted and inflamed with a grand object, moulds objects for its gratification with great facility. Longinus, with re&s;pect to the di|mini&s;hing power of a hyperbole, cites the following ludicrous thought from a comic poet. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He was owner of a bit of ground not larger than a Lacedemonian let|ter.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 31. of his treati&s;e on the &s;ublime.</NOTE>"</Q> But, for the rea&s;on now given, the hyperbole has by far the greater force in magnifying objects; of which take the fol|lowing &s;pecimen.
<Q><P>For all the land which thou &s;ee&s;t, to thee will I give it, and to thy &s;eed for ever. And I will make thy &s;eed as the du&s;t of the earth: &s;o that if a

<PB N="93" REF="92">
exceeds the common mea&s;ure."</Q> From the&s;e premi&s;&s;es, one would not expect the following conclu&s;ion, the only rea&s;on he can find for ju&s;tifying this figure of &s;peech. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Conceditur enim amplius dicere, quia dici quantum e&s;t, non pote&s;t: meliu&s;que ultra quam citra &s;tat oratio."</Q> (We are in|dulged to &s;ay more than enough, becau&s;e we cannot &s;ay enough; and it is better to be over than under). In the name of won|der, why this &s;light and childi&s;h rea&s;on, when immediately before he had made it evident, that the hyperbole is founded on human nature? I could not re&s;i&s;t this per|&s;onal &s;troke of critici&s;m, intended not a|gain&s;t our author, for no human creature is exempt from error; but again&s;t the blind veneration that is paid to the ancient cla&s;&s;ic writers, without di&s;tingui&s;hing their ble|mi&s;hes from their beauties.</P>
<P>Having examined the nature of this fi|gure, and the principle on which it is e|rected; I proceed, as in the fir&s;t &s;ection, to &s;ome rules by which it ought to be govern|ed. And in the fir&s;t place, it is a capital fault to introduce an hyperbole in the de|&s;cription
<PB N="94" REF="93">
of an ordinary object or event which creates no &s;urpri&s;e. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the hyperbole is altogether unnatural, being de&s;titute of &s;urpri&s;e, the only foundation that can &s;upport it. Take the following in|&s;tance, where the &s;ubject is extremely fa|miliar, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;wimming to gain the &s;hore after a &s;hipwreck.

</SP>

<P>In the next place, it may be gathered from what is &s;aid, that an hyperbole can never &s;uit the tone of any di&s;piriting pa&s;&s;ion. Sorrow in particular will never prompt &s;uch a figure; and for that rea&s;on the following hyperboles mu&s;t be condemned as unnatu|ral.

<P>Thirdly, a writer, if he wi&s;h to &s;ucceed, ought always to have the reader in his eye. He ought in particular never to venture a bold thought or expre&s;&s;ion, till the reader be warmed and prepared for it. For this rea&s;on, an hyperbole in the beginning of a|ny work can never be in its place. Ex|ample:
<Q><L>Jam pauca aratro jugera regiae</L>
<L>Moles relinquent.</L>
<BIBL>Horat. Carm. lib. 2. ode. 15.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>In the fourth place, the nice&s;t point of all, is to a&s;certain the natural limits of an hyper|bole, beyond which being over&s;trained it
<PB N="96" REF="95">
has a bad effect. Longinus, in the above|cited chapter, with great propriety of thought, enters a caveat again&s;t an hyper|bole of this kind. He compares it to a bow&s;tring, which relaxes by over&s;train|ing, and produceth an effect directly oppo|&s;ite to what is intended. I pretend not to a&s;certain any preci&s;e boundary: the attempt would be difficult, if not impracticable. I mu&s;t therefore be &s;atisfied with an humbler ta&s;k, which is, to give a &s;pecimen of what I reckon over&s;trained hyperboles; and I &s;hall be al&s;o extremely curt upon this &s;ubject, becau&s;e examples are to be found every where. No fault is more common among writers of inferior rank; and in&s;tances are found even among tho&s;e of the fine&s;t ta&s;te; witne&s;s the following hyperbole, too bold even for an Hot&s;pur.

<HEAD>SECT. V. A figure, which, among related objects, ex|tends properties of one to another.</HEAD>
<P>THis figure is not dignified with a pro|per name, becau&s;e it has been over|looked by all writers. It merits, however, place in this work; and mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e formerly handled, as depend|ing on a different principle. <HI>Giddy brink, jovial wine, daring wound,</HI> are examples of this figure. Here are expre&s;&s;ions that cer|tainly import not the ordinary relation of an adjective to its &s;ub&s;tantive. A <HI>brink,</HI> for example, cannot be termed <HI>giddy</HI> in a proper &s;en&s;e: neither can it be termed <HI>giddy</HI> in any figurative &s;en&s;e that can import any of its qualities or attributes. When we at|tend to the expre&s;&s;ion, we di&s;cover that a <HI>brink</HI> is termed <HI>giddy</HI> from producing that effect in tho&s;e who &s;tand on it. In the &s;ame manner a wound is &s;aid to be daring,
<PB N="101" REF="100">
not with re&s;pect to it&s;elf, but with re&s;pect to the boldne&s;s of the per&s;on who inflicts it: and wine is &s;aid to be jovial, as in&s;piring mirth and jollity. Thus the attributes of one &s;ubject, are extended to another with which it is connected; and &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a figure, becau&s;e it deviates from ordinary language.</P>
<P>How are we to account for this figure, for we &s;ee it lies in the thought, and to what principle &s;hall we refer it? Have poets a privilege to alter the nature of things, and at plea&s;ure to be&s;tow attributes upon &s;ub|jects to which the&s;e attributes do not be|long? It is an evident truth, which we have had often occa&s;ion to inculcate, that the mind, in idea, pa&s;&s;eth ea&s;ily and &s;weet|ly along a train of connected objects; and, where the objects are intimately connected, that it is di&s;po&s;ed to carry along the good or bad properties of one to another; e&s;pe|cially where it is in any degree inflamed with the&s;e properties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 4.</NOTE>. From this princi|ple is derived the figure under con&s;ideration.
<PB N="102" REF="101">
Language, invented for the communication of thought, would be imperfect, if it were not expre&s;&s;ive even of the &s;lighter propen|&s;ities and more delicate feelings. But lan|guage cannot remain &s;o imperfect, among a people who have received any poli&s;h; be|cau&s;e language is regulated by internal feel|ing, and is gradually &s;o improved as to ex|pre&s;s whatever pa&s;&s;es in the mind. Thus, for example, a &s;word in the hand of a coward, is, in poetical diction, termed <HI>a coward &s;word:</HI> the expre&s;&s;ion is &s;ignificative of an internal operation; for the mind, in pa&s;&s;ing from the agent to its in&s;trument, is di&s;po&s;ed to extend to the latter the proper|ties of the former.

<HEAD>SECT VI. Metaphor and Allegory.</HEAD>
<P>A Metaphor differs from a &s;imile, in form only, not in &s;ub&s;tance. In a &s;i|mile the two different &s;ubjects are kept di&s;|tinct in the expre&s;&s;ion, as well as in the thought: in a metaphor, the two &s;ub|jects are kept di&s;tinct in thought only, not in expre&s;&s;ion. A hero re&s;embles a lion, and upon that re&s;emblance many &s;imiles have been made by Homer and other poets. But in&s;tead of re&s;embling a lion, let us take the aid of the imagination, and feign or fi|gure the hero to be a lion. By this varia|tion the &s;imile is converted into a metaphor; which is carried on by de&s;cribing all the qualities of a lion that re&s;emble tho&s;e of the hero. The fundamental plea&s;ure here, that of re&s;emblance, belongs to thought as di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from expre&s;&s;ion. There is an addition|al plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from the expre&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="109" REF="108">
The poet, by figuring his hero to be a lion, goes on to de&s;cribe the lion in appearance, but in reality the hero; and his de&s;cription is peculiarly beautiful, by expre&s;&s;ing the vir|tues and qualities of the hero in new terms, which, properly &s;peaking, belong not to him, but to a different being. This will better be under&s;tood by examples. A family connected with a common pa|rent, re&s;embles a tree, the trunk and branches of which are connected with a common root. But let us &s;uppo&s;e, that a family is figured not barely to be like a tree, but to be a tree; and then the &s;imile will be converted into a metaphor, in the following manner.

<P>I am aware that the term <HI>metaphor</HI> has been u&s;ed in a more exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e than I give it; but I thought it of con&s;equence, in matters of &s;ome intricacy, to &s;eparate things that differ from each other, and to confine words within their mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e. An allegory differs from a metaphor; and what I would chu&s;e to call <HI>a figure of &s;peech,</HI> dif|fers from both. I &s;hall proceed to explain the&s;e differences. A metaphor is defined a|bove to be an operation of the imagination, figuring one thing to be another. An al|legory requires no operation of the imagina|tion, nor is one thing figured to be another: it con&s;i&s;ts in chu&s;ing a &s;ubject having pro|perties or circum&s;tances re&s;embling tho&s;e of
<PB N="112" REF="111">
the principal &s;ubject; and the former is de|&s;cribed in &s;uch a manner as to repre&s;ent the latter. The &s;ubject thus repre&s;ented is kept out of view; we are left to di&s;co|ver it by reflection; and we are plea&s;ed with the di&s;covery, becau&s;e it is our own work. Quintilian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 8. cap. 6. &s;ect. 2,</NOTE> gives the following in&s;tance of an allegory,
<Q><L>O navis, referent in mare te novi</L>
<L>Fluctus. O quid agis? fortiter occupa portum.</L>
<BIBL>Horat. lib. 1. ode 14,</BIBL></Q>
and explains it elegantly in the following words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Totu&s;que ille Horatii locus, quo navim pro republica, fluctuum tempe|&s;tates pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pa|ce atque concordia, dicit."</Q></P>
<P>There cannot be a finer or more correct allegory than the following, in which a vineyard is put for God's own people the Jews.
<Q><P>Thou ha&s;t brought a vine out of Egypt: thou ha&s;t ca&s;t out the heathen, and planted it. Thou did&s;t cau&s;e it to take deep root, and it filled the
<PB N="113" REF="112">
land. The hills were covered with its &s;hadow, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. Why ha&s;t thou then broken down her hedges, &s;o that all which pa&s;s do pluck her? The boar out of the wood doth wa&s;te it, and the wild bea&s;t doth de|vour it. Return, we be&s;eech thee, O God of ho&s;ts: look down from heaven, and behold and vi&s;it this vine, and the vineyard thy right hand hath planted, and the branch thou made&s;t &s;trong for thy&s;elf.</P>
<BIBL>P&s;alm 80.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>In a word, an allegory is in every re&s;pect &s;imilar to an hieroglyphical painting, ex|cepting only, that words are u&s;ed in&s;tead of colours. Their effects are preci&s;ely the &s;ame. A hieroglyphic rai&s;es two images in the mind; one &s;een, which repre&s;ents one not &s;een. An allegory does the &s;ame. The repre&s;entative &s;ubject is de&s;cribed; and it is by re&s;emblance that we are enabled to ap|ply the de&s;cription to the &s;ubject repre&s;ent|ed.</P>
<P>In a figure of &s;peech, neither is there any fiction of the imagination em|ploy'd, nor a repre&s;entative &s;ubject introdu|ced. A figure of &s;peech, as imply'd from
<PB N="114" REF="113">
its name, regards the expre&s;&s;ion only, not the thought; and it may be defined, the employing a word in a &s;en&s;e different from what is proper to it. Thus youth or the beginning of life, is expre&s;&s;ed figuratively by <HI>morning of life.</HI> Morning is the begin|ning of the day; and it is transferred &s;weet|ly and ea&s;ily to &s;ignify the beginning of any other &s;eries, life e&s;pecially, the progre&s;s of which is reckoned by days.</P>
<P>Figures of &s;peech are re&s;erved for a &s;epa|rate &s;ection; but a metaphor and allegory are &s;o much connected, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to handle them together: the rules for di&s;|tingui&s;hing the good from the bad, are common to both. We &s;hall therefore pro|ceed to the&s;e rules, after adding &s;ome ex|amples to illu&s;trate the nature of an allego|ry. Horace &s;peaking of his love to Pyrrha, which was now extingui&s;hed, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus.

The rules that govern metaphors and al|legories, are of two kinds: tho&s;e of the fir&s;t kind concern the con&s;truction of a meta|phor or allegory, and a&s;certain what are perfect and what are faulty: tho&s;e of the other kind concern the propriety or impro|priety of introduction, in what circum&s;tances the&s;e figures may be admitted, and in what circum&s;tances they are out of place.

<P>And in the fir&s;t place, it has been ob&s;er|ved, that a &s;imile cannot be agreeable where the re&s;emblance is either too &s;trong or too faint.

<BIBL>Merchant of Venice, act 3. &s;c. 3.</BIBL></Q> The following metaphor is &s;trained be|yond all endurance. Timur-bec, known to us by the name of Tamarlane the Great, writes to Bajazet Emperor of the Ottomans in the following terms.<Q><P>Where is the monarch who dares re&s;i&s;t us? where is the potentate who doth not glory in being num|bered among our attendants? As for thee, de&s;cend|ed from a Turcoman &s;ailor, &s;ince the ve&s;&s;el of thy unbounded ambition hath been wreck'd in the gulf of they &s;elf-love, it would be proper, that thou &s;hould&s;t take in the &s;ails of they temerity, and ca&s;t the anchor of repentance in the port of &s;incerity and ju&s;tice, which is the port of &s;afety; le&s;t the tempe&s;t of our vengeance make thee peri&s;h in the &s;ea of the puni&s;hment thou de&s;erve&s;t.</P></Q> Such &s;trained figures, it is ob&s;ervable, are
<PB N="119" REF="118">
not unfrequent in the fir&s;t dawn of refine|ment. The mind in a new enjoyment knows no bounds, and is generally carried to exce&s;s, till experience di&s;cover the ju&s;t medium.</P>
<P>Secondly, whatever re&s;emblance &s;ubjects may have, it is wrong to put one for ano|ther if they bear no mutual proportion. Where a very high and a very low &s;ubject are compared, the &s;imile takes on an air of burle&s;k; and the &s;ame will be the effect, where the one is imagined to be the other, as in a metaphor, or made to repre&s;ent the other, as in an allegory.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the&s;e figures, a metaphor in particular, ought not to be extended to a great length, nor be crowded with many minute circum&s;tances; for in that ca&s;e it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to avoid ob&s;curity. It is difficult, during any cour&s;e of time, to &s;up|port a lively image of one thing being ano|ther. A metaphor drawn out to any length, in&s;tead of illu&s;trating or enlivening the principal &s;ubject, becomes di&s;agreeable by over&s;training the mind. Cowley is ex|tremely
<PB N="120" REF="119">
licentious in this way. Take the following in&s;tance:
<Q><L>Great, and wi&s;e conqu'ror, who where-e'er</L>
<L>Thou com'&s;t, do&s;t fortify, and &s;ettle there!</L>
<L>Who can&s;t defend as well as get;</L>
<L>And never had&s;t one quarter beat up yet;</L>
<L>Now thou art in, thou ne'er will part</L>
<L>With one inch of my vanqui&s;h'd heart;</L>
<L>For &s;ince thou took'&s;t it by a&s;&s;ault from me,</L>
<L>'Tis garri&s;on'd &s;o &s;trong with thoughts of thee</L>
<L>It fears no beauteous enemy.</L></Q>
For the &s;ame rea&s;on, however agreeable at fir&s;t long allegories may be by their novelty, they never afford any la&s;ting plea&s;ure: wit|ne&s;s the <HI>Fairy Queen,</HI> which with great power of expre&s;&s;ion, variety of images, and melody of ver&s;ification, is &s;carce ever read a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, the compari&s;on car|ried on in a &s;imile, being in a metaphor &s;unk, and the principal &s;ubject being ima|gined that very thing which it only re&s;em|bles, an opportunity is furni&s;hed to de&s;cribe it in terms taken &s;trictly or literally with re|&s;pect to its imagined nature. This &s;ugge&s;ts
<PB N="121" REF="120">
another rule, That in con&s;tructing a meta|phor, the writer ought to confine him&s;elf to the &s;imple&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, and make u&s;e of &s;uch words only as are applicable literally to the imagined nature of his &s;ubject. Fi|gurative words ought carefully to be avoid|ed; for &s;uch complicated images, in&s;tead of &s;etting the principal &s;ubject in a &s;trong light, involve it in a cloud; and it is well if the reader, without rejecting by the lump, endeavour patiently to gather the plain meaning, regardle&s;s of the figures:

<PB N="122" REF="121">
Again, by a figure of &s;peech, flame may be put for fire, becau&s;e they are commonly conjoined; and therefore a fever may al&s;o be imagined a flame.

In the &s;ixth place, It is unplea&s;ant to join different metaphors in the &s;ame period, even where they are pre&s;erved di&s;tinct.

Lord Halifax, &s;peaking of the ancient fa|buli&s;ts: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They (&s;ays he) wrote in &s;igns and &s;poke in parables: all their fables carry a double meaning: the &s;tory is one and entire; the characters the &s;ame throughout; not broken or changed, and always conformable to the nature of the creature they introduce. They never tell you, that the dog which &s;napp'd at a &s;hadow, lo&s;t his troop of hor&s;e; that would be unintelligible. This is his (Dry|den's) new way of telling a &s;tory, and confounding the moral and the fable to|gether."</Q> After in&s;tancing from the hind and panther, he goes on thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What relation has the hind to our Sa|viour? or what notion have we of a

<P>A few words more upon allegory. No|thing gives greater plea&s;ure than this figure, when the repre&s;entative &s;ubject bears a &s;trong analogy, in all its circum&s;tances, to that which is repre&s;ented. But the choice is &s;eldom &s;o lucky; the re&s;emblance of the repre&s;entative &s;ubject to the principal, be|ing generally &s;o faint and ob&s;cure, as to puzzle and not plea&s;e. An allegory is &s;till more difficult in painting than in poetry. The former can &s;how no re&s;emblance but what appears to the eye: the latter hath many other re&s;ources for &s;howing the re|&s;emblance. With re&s;pect to what the Abb&eacute; du Bos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reflexions &s;ur la Poe&s;ie, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> vol. 1. &s;ect. 24.</NOTE> terms mixt allegorical compo&s;i|tions, the&s;e may do in poetry, becau&s;e in writing the allegory can ea&s;ily be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the hi&s;torical part: no per&s;on
<PB N="130" REF="129">
mi&s;takes Virgil's Fame for a real being. But &s;uch a mixture in a picture is intolerable; becau&s;e in a picture the objects mu&s;t ap|pear all of the &s;ame kind, wholly real or wholly emblematical. The hi&s;tory of Mary de Medicis, in the palace of Luxen|bourg, painted by Rubens, is in a vicious ta&s;te, by a perpetual jumble of real and al|legorical per&s;onages, which produce a di&s;|cordance of parts and an ob&s;curity upon the whole: witne&s;s in particular, the tablature re|pre&s;enting the arrival of Mary de Medicis at Mar&s;eilles: mixt with the real per&s;onages, the Nereids and Tritons appear &s;ounding their &s;hells. Such a mixture of fiction and reality in the &s;ame group, is &s;trangely ab|&s;urd. The picture of Alexander and Roxana, de&s;cribed by Lucian, is gay and fanciful: but it &s;uffers by the allegorical figures. It is not in the wit of man to in|vent an allegorical repre&s;entation deviating farther from any appearance of re&s;emblance, than one exhibited by Lewis XIV. <HI>anno</HI> 1664; in which an overgrown chariot, in|tended to repre&s;ent that of the &s;un, is
<PB N="131" REF="130">
dragg'd along, &s;urrounded with men and women, repre&s;enting the four ages of the world, the cele&s;tial &s;igns, the &s;ea&s;ons, the hours, <HI>&amp;c.:</HI> a mon&s;trous compo&s;ition; and yet &s;carce more ab&s;urd than Guido's tabla|ture of Aurora.</P>
<P>In an allegory, as well as in a metaphor, terms ought to be cho&s;en that properly and literally are applicable to the repre&s;entative &s;ubject. Nor ought any circum&s;tance to be added, that is not proper to the repre&s;enta|tive &s;ubject, however ju&s;tly it may be ap|plicable figuratively to the principal. Upon this account the following allegory is faulty.
<Q><L>Ferus et Cupido,</L>
<L>Semper ardentes acuens &s;agittas</L>
<L>Cote <HI>cruent&acirc;.</HI></L>
<BIBL>Horat. l. 2. ode 8.</BIBL></Q>
For though blood may &s;ugge&s;t the cru|elty of love, it is an improper or immaterial circum&s;tance in the repre&s;entative &s;ubject: water, not blood, is proper for a whet&s;tone.</P>
<P>We proceed to the next head, which is, to examine in what circum&s;tances the&s;e fi|gures
<PB N="132" REF="131">
are proper, in what improper. This inquiry is not altogether &s;uper&s;eded by what is &s;aid upon the &s;ame &s;ubject in the chapter of compari&s;ons; becau&s;e, upon trial, it will be found, that a &s;hort metaphor or allegory may be proper, where a &s;imile, drawn out to a greater length, and in its nature more &s;olemn, would &s;carce be reli&s;hed. The difference however is not con&s;iderable; and in mo&s;t in&s;tances the &s;ame rules are ap|plicable to both. And, in the fir&s;t place, a metaphor, as well as a &s;imile, are exclu|ded from common conver&s;ation, and from the de&s;cription of ordinary incidents.</P>
<P>In the next place, in any &s;evere pa&s;&s;ion which totally occupies the mind, metaphor is unnatural. For that rea&s;on, we mu&s;t condemn the following &s;peech of Macbeth.

The fine&s;t picture that ever was drawn of deep di&s;tre&s;s, is in Macbeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 4. &s;c. 6.</NOTE>, where Mac|duff is repre&s;ented lamenting his wife and children, inhumanly murdered by the tyrant. Struck with the news, he que&s;tions the me&s;&s;enger over and over; not that he doubt|ed the fact, but that his heart revolted a|gain&s;t &s;o cruel a misfortune. After &s;trug|gling &s;ome time with his grief, he turns from his wife and children to their &s;avage
<PB N="135" REF="134">
butcher; and then gives vent to his re&s;ent|ment; but &s;till with manline&s;s and dignity:
<Q><L>O, I could play the woman with mine eyes,</L>
<L>And braggart with my tongue. But, gentle Heav'n!</L>
<L>Cut &s;hort all intermi&s;&s;ion: front to front</L>

<L>Within my &s;word's length &s;et him&mdash;If he '&s;cape,</L>
<L>Then Heav'n forgive him too.</L></Q>
This pa&s;&s;age is a delicious picture of human nature. One expre&s;&s;ion only &s;eems doubt|ful. In examining the me&s;&s;enger, Macduff expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus:
<Q><L>He hath no children&mdash;all my pretty ones!</L>
<L>Did you &s;ay all? what all? Oh, hell-kite! all?</L>
<L>What! all my pretty little chickens and their dam,</L>
<L>At one fell &s;woop!</L></Q>
Metaphorical expre&s;&s;ion, I am &s;en&s;ible, may &s;ometimes be u&s;ed with grace, where a re|gular &s;imile would be intolerable: but there are &s;ituations &s;o overwhelming, as not to admit even the &s;lighte&s;t metaphor. It requires great delicacy of ta&s;te to determine with firmne&s;s, whether the pre&s;ent ca&s;e be of that nature. I incline to think it is; and
<PB N="136" REF="135">
yet I would not willingly alter a &s;ingle word of this admirable &s;cene.</P>
<P>But metaphorical language is proper when a man &s;truggles to bear with dignity or decency a misfortune however great. The &s;truggle agitates and animates the mind:

<HEAD>SECT. VII. Figure of Speech.</HEAD>
<P>IN the &s;ection immediately foregoing, a figure of &s;peech is defined, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The em|ploying
<PB N="137" REF="136">
a word in a &s;en&s;e different from what is proper to it;"</Q> and the new or uncommon &s;en&s;e of the word is termed <HI>the figurative &s;en&s;e.</HI> The figurative &s;en&s;e mu&s;t have a relation to that which is proper; and the more intimate the relation is, the figure is the more happy. How ornamental this figure is to language, will not be readily i|magined by any one who hath not given peculiar attention. I &s;hall endeavour to di&s;|play its capital beauties and advantages. In the fir&s;t place, a word u&s;ed figuratively, to|gether with its new &s;en&s;e, &s;ugge&s;ts what it commonly bears: and thus it has the effect to pre&s;ent two objects; one &s;ignified by the figurative &s;en&s;e, which may be termed <HI>the principal object;</HI> and one &s;ignified by the proper &s;en&s;e, which may be termed <HI>acce&s;&s;o|ry.</HI> The principal makes a part of the thought; the acce&s;&s;ory is merely ornamen|tal. In this re&s;pect, a figure of &s;peech is preci&s;ely &s;imilar to concordant &s;ounds in mu&s;ic, which, without contributing to the melody, make it harmonious. I explain my&s;elf by examples. <HI>Youth,</HI> by a figure of &s;peech, is termed <HI>the morning of life.</HI> This
<PB N="138" REF="137">
expre&s;&s;ion &s;ignifies <HI>youth,</HI> the principal ob|ject, which enters into the thought: but it &s;ugge&s;ts, at the &s;ame time, the proper &s;en&s;e of <HI>morning;</HI> and this acce&s;&s;ory object being in it&s;elf beautiful and connected by re&s;emblance to the principal object, is not a little ornamental. I give another exam|ple, of a different kind, where an attribute is expre&s;&s;ed figuratively, <HI>Imperious ocean.</HI> Together with the figurative meaning of the epithet <HI>imperious,</HI> there is &s;ugge&s;ted its proper meaning, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;tern authority of a de&s;potic prince. Upon this figurative power of words, Vida de&s;cants with great elegance:
<Q><L>Nonne vides, verbis ut veris &s;aepe relictis</L>

<P>In the next place, this figure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;ignal power of aggrandi&s;ing an object, by the following means. Words, which have no original beauty but what ari&s;es from their &s;ound, acquire an adventitious beauty from their meaning. A word &s;ignifying any thing that is agreeable, becomes by that means agreeable; for the agreeablene&s;s of the object is communicated to its name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 4.</NOTE>. This acquired beauty, by the force of cu|&s;tom, adheres to the word even when u&s;ed figuratively; and the beauty received from the thing it properly &s;ignifies, is communi|cated to the thing which it is made to &s;ig|nify
<PB N="140" REF="139">
figuratively. Con&s;ider the foregoing expre&s;&s;ion <HI>Imperious ocean,</HI> how much more elevated it is than <HI>Stormy ocean.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, this figure hath a happy effect in preventing the familiarity of proper names. The familiarity of a proper name, is com|municated to the thing it &s;ignifies by means of their intimate connection; and the thing is thereby brought down in our feeling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have often regretted, that a factious &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition to the reigning family made it nece&s;&s;ary in public wor&s;hip to di&s;tingui&s;h the King by his proper name. One will &s;carce ima|gine, who has not made the trial, how much better it &s;ounds to pray for our Sovereign Lord the King, without any addition.</NOTE>. This bad effect is prevented by u&s;ing a figu|rative word in&s;tead of one that is proper; as, for example, when we expre&s;s the &s;ky by terming it <HI>the blue vault of heaven.</HI> For though no work made with hands can com|pare with the &s;ky in magnificence, the ex|pre&s;&s;ion however is good, by preventing the object from being brought down by the familiarity of its proper name. With re&s;pect to the degrading familiarity of pro|per names, Vida has the following pa&s;&s;age.
<Q><L>Hinc &s;i dura mihi pa&s;&s;us dicendus Uly&s;&s;es,</L>
<L><PB N="141" REF="140">

<P>La&s;tly, by this figure language is enriched and rendered more copious. In that re|&s;pect, were there no other, a figure of &s;peech is a happy invention. This property is finely touched by Vida:
<Q><L>Quinetiam agricolas ea fandi nota voluptas</L>
<L>Exercet, dum laeta &s;eges, dum trudere gemmas</L>
<L>Incipiunt vites, &s;itientiaque aetheris imbrem</L>

<P>The beauties I have mentioned belong to every figure of &s;peech. Several other beauties peculiar to one or other &s;ort, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to remark afterward.</P>
<P>Not only &s;ubjects, but qualities, actions, effects, may be expre&s;&s;ed figuratively. Thus
<PB N="142" REF="141">
as to &s;ubjects, <HI>the gates of breath</HI> for the lips, <HI>the watery kingdom</HI> for the ocean. As to qualities, <HI>fierce</HI> for &s;tormy, in the expre&s;|&s;ion <HI>Fierce winter: altus</HI> for profundus, <HI>al|tus puteus, altum mare: Breathing</HI> for per|&s;piring, <HI>Breathing plants.</HI> Again, as to ac|tions, the &s;ea <HI>rages:</HI> Time will <HI>melt</HI> her frozen thoughts: Time <HI>kills</HI> grief. An ef|fect is put for the cau&s;e, as <HI>lux</HI> for the &s;un; and a cau&s;e for the effect, as <HI>boum labores</HI> for corn. The relation of re&s;emblance is one plentiful &s;ource of figures of &s;peech; and nothing is more common than to apply to one object the name of another that re|&s;embles it in any re&s;pect. Height, &s;ize, and wordly greatne&s;s, though in them&s;elves they have no re&s;emblance, produce emo|tions in the mind that have a re&s;emblance; and, led by this re&s;emblance, we naturally expre&s;s worldly greatne&s;s by height or &s;ize. One feels a certain unea&s;ine&s;s in looking down to a great depth: and hence depth is made to expre&s;s any thing di&s;agreeable by exce&s;s; as <HI>depth</HI> of grief, <HI>depth</HI> of de&s;pair. Again, height of place and time long pa&s;t, produce &s;imilar feelings; and hence the ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="143" REF="142">
<HI>Ut altius repetam.</HI> Di&s;tance in pa&s;t time, producing a &s;trong feeling, is put for any &s;trong feeling: <HI>Nihil mihi antiquius no&s;tra amicitia.</HI> Shortne&s;s with relation to &s;pace, for &s;hortne&s;s with relation to time: <HI>Brevis e&s;&s;e laboro; ob&s;curus fio.</HI> Suffering a puni&s;h|ment re&s;embles paying a debt: hence <HI>pen|dere poenas.</HI> Upon the &s;ame account, light may be put for glory, &s;un-&s;hine for pro&s;pe|rity, and weight for importance.</P>
<P>Many words, originally figurative, ha|ving, by long and con&s;tant u&s;e, lo&s;t their figurative power, are degraded to the infe|rior rank of proper terms. Thus the words that expre&s;s the operations of the mind, have in all languages been originally figura|tive. The rea&s;on holds in all, that when the&s;e operations came fir&s;t under con&s;idera|tion, there was no other way of de&s;cribing them but by what they re&s;embled. It was not practicable to give them proper names, as may be done to objects that can be a&s;|certained by &s;ight and touch. A <HI>&s;oft</HI> na|ture, <HI>jarring</HI> tempers, <HI>weight</HI> of wo, <HI>pom|pous</HI> phra&s;e, <HI>beget</HI> compa&s;&s;ion, <HI>a&s;&s;uage</HI> grief, <HI>break</HI> a vow, <HI>bend</HI> the eye downward, <HI>&s;hower</HI>

down cur&s;es, <HI>drown'd</HI> in tears, <HI>wrapt</HI> in joy, <HI>warm'd</HI> with eloquence, <HI>loaden</HI> with &s;poils, and a thou&s;and other expre&s;&s;ions of the like nature, have lo&s;t their figurative &s;en&s;e. Some terms there are, that cannot be &s;aid to be either purely figurative or altogether proper: originally figurative, they are tend|ing to &s;implicity, without having lo&s;t alto|gether their figurative power. Virgil's <HI>Regi|na &s;aucia cura,</HI> is perhaps one of the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions.

<P>To epitomi&s;e this &s;ubject, and at the &s;ame time to give a clear view of it, I can|not think of a better method, than to pre|&s;ent to the reader a li&s;t of the &s;everal rela|tions upon which figures of &s;peech are com|monly founded. This li&s;t I divide into two tables; one of &s;ubjects expre&s;&s;ed figurative|ly, and one of attributes.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="145" REF="144">
<HEAD>FIRST TABLE. Subjects expre&s;&s;ed figuratively.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. A word proper to one &s;ubject employ|ed figuratively to expre&s;s a re&s;embling &s;ub|ject.
<P>There is no figure of &s;peech &s;o frequent, as what is derived from the relation of re|&s;emblance. Youth, for example, is &s;igni|fied figuratively by the <HI>morning</HI> of life. The life of a man re&s;embles a natural day in &s;e|veral particulars. The morning is the be|ginning of day, youth the beginning of life: the morning is chearful, &s;o is youth; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By another re&s;emblance, a bold warrior is termed the <HI>thunderbolt</HI> of war; a multitude of troubles, a <HI>&s;ea</HI> of troubles.</P>
<P>No other figure of &s;peech po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o many different beauties, as that which is founded on re&s;emblance. Be&s;ide the beau|ties above mentioned, common to all &s;orts, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in particular the beauty of a me|taphor or of a &s;imile. A figure of &s;peech
<PB N="146" REF="145">
built upon re&s;emblance, &s;ugge&s;ts always a compari&s;on betwixt the principal &s;ubject and the acce&s;&s;ory; and by this means every good effect of a metaphor or &s;imile, may, in a &s;hort and lively manner, be produced by this figure of &s;peech.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A word proper to the effect employ'd figuratively to expre&s;s the cau&s;e.
<P><HI>Lux</HI> for the &s;un. <HI>Shadow</HI> for cloud. A helmet is &s;ignified by the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>glitter|ing terror.</HI> A tree by <HI>&s;hadow</HI> or <HI>umbrage.</HI> Hence the expre&s;&s;ion,
<Q><L>Nec habet Pelion umbras.</L>
<BIBL>Ovid.</BIBL></Q><Q><L>Where the dun umbrage hangs.</L>
<BIBL>Spring, l. 1023.</BIBL></Q>
A wound is made to &s;ignify an arrow:
<Q><L>Vulnere non pedibus te con&s;equar.</L>
<BIBL>Ovid.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>There is a peculiar force and beauty in this figure. The word which &s;ignifies fi|guratively the principal &s;ubject, denotes it to be a cau&s;e by &s;ugge&s;ting the effect.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="147" REF="146">
3. A word proper to the cau&s;e, employ'd figuratively to expre&s;s the effect.

<Q><L>Caecis erramus in undis.</L>
<BIBL>Aeneid. iii. 200.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>There is a peculiar energy in this figure &s;imilar to that in the former. The figura|tive name denotes the &s;ubject to be an ef|fect by &s;ugge&s;ting its cau&s;e.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Two things being intimately connect|ed, the proper name of the one employ'd figuratively to &s;ignify the other.
<P><HI>Day</HI> for light. <HI>Night</HI> for darkne&s;s. Hence, A &s;udden night. <HI>Winter</HI> for a &s;torm at &s;ea.

<P>The ample field of figurative expre&s;&s;ion di&s;play'd in the&s;e tables, affords great &s;cope for rea&s;oning and reflection. Several of the ob&s;ervations relating to metaphor, are ap|plicable to figures of &s;peech. The&s;e I
<PB N="155" REF="154">
&s;hall &s;lightly retouch, with &s;ome additions peculiarly adapted to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as the figure under con&s;ideration is built upon relation, we find from experience, and it mu&s;t be obvious from rea&s;on, that the beauty of the figure depends on the intimacy of the relation be|twixt the figurative and proper &s;en&s;e of the word. A &s;light re&s;emblance, in parti|cular, will never make this figure agreeable. The expre&s;&s;ion, for example, <HI>drink down a &s;ecret,</HI> for li&s;tening to a &s;ecret with atten|tion, is har&s;h and uncouth, becau&s;e there is &s;carce any re&s;emblance betwixt <HI>li&s;tening</HI> and <HI>drinking.</HI> The expre&s;&s;ion <HI>weighty crack,</HI> u&s;ed by Ben John&s;on for <HI>loud crack,</HI> is wor&s;e if po&s;&s;ible: a loud &s;ound has not the &s;lighte&s;t re&s;emblance to a piece of mat|ter that is weighty. The following expre&s;|&s;ion of Lucretius is not le&s;s faulty. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Et lepido quae &s;unt <HI>fucata</HI> &s;onore." <BIBL>i. 645.</BIBL></Q><Q><L>&mdash;Sed magis</L>

<P>The following figures of &s;peech &s;eem al|together wild and extravagant, the figurative

and proper meaning having no connection whatever. <HI>Moving</HI> &s;oftne&s;s, fre&s;hne&s;s <HI>breathes, breathing</HI> pro&s;pect, <HI>flowing</HI> &s;pring, <HI>dewy</HI> light, <HI>lucid</HI> coolne&s;s, and many others of this fal&s;e coin may be found in Thom|&s;on's <HI>Sea&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, the proper &s;en&s;e of the word ought to bear &s;ome proportion to the figu|rative &s;en&s;e, and not &s;oar much above it, nor &s;ink much below it. This rule, as well as the foregoing, is finely illu&s;trated by Vida:
<Q><L>Haec adeo cum &s;int, cum fas audere poetis</L>
<L>Multa modis multis; tamen ob&s;ervare memento,</L>
<L>Si quando haud propriis rem mavis dicere verbis,</L>
<L>Tran&s;lati&s;que aliunde notis, longeque petitis,</L>
<L>Ne nimiam o&s;tendas, quaerendo talia, curam.</L>
<L>Namque aliqui exercent vim duram, et rebus iniqui</L>

<L>Aut crines magnae genitricis gramina dicat.</L>
<BIBL>Poet. l. iii. 148.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="157">
Thirdly, in a figure of &s;peech, every circum&s;tance ought to be avoided that a|grees with the proper &s;en&s;e only, not the figurative &s;en&s;e; for it is the latter that expre&s;&s;es the thought, and the former &s;erves for no other purpo&s;e but to make harmo|ny:
<Q><L>Zacynthus green with ever-&s;hady groves,</L>
<L>And Ithaca, pre&s;umptuous boa&s;t their loves;</L>
<L>Obtruding on my choice a &s;econd lord,</L>
<L>They pre&s;s the Hymenean rite abhorr'd.</L>
<BIBL>Ody&s;&s;ey xix. 152.</BIBL></Q>
Zacynthus here &s;tanding figuratively for the inhabitants, the de&s;cription of the i&s;land is quite out of place. It puzzles the reader, by making him doubt whether the word ought to be taken in its proper or figurative &s;en&s;e.

The di&s;gu&s;t one has to drink ink in reality,
<PB N="159" REF="158">
is nothing to the purpo&s;e where the &s;ubject is drinking ink figuratively.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, to draw con&s;equen|ces from a figure of &s;peech, as if the word were to be under&s;tood literally, is a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity, for it is confounding truth with fiction:
<Q><SP>

<BIBL>Richard II. act 1. &s;c. 3.</BIBL></Q>
Sin may be imagined heavy in a figurative &s;en&s;e: but weight in a proper &s;en&s;e belongs to the acce&s;&s;ory only; and therefore to de|&s;cribe the effects of weight, is to de&s;ert the principal &s;ubject, and to convert the acce&s;&s;ory into a principal.

This would be very right, if there were a|ny incon&s;i&s;tence in being interred in one place really and in another place figura|tively.</P>
<P>From con&s;idering that a word em|ploy'd in a figurative &s;en&s;e &s;ugge&s;ts at the &s;ame time its proper meaning, a fifth rule occurs, That to rai&s;e a figure of &s;peech, we ought to u&s;e no word, the proper &s;en&s;e of which is incon&s;i&s;tent or incongruous with the &s;ubject: for no incongruity, far le&s;s incon&s;i&s;tency, whether real or imagined, ought to enter into the expre&s;&s;ion of any &s;ubject:
<Q><L>Interea genitor Tyberini ad fluminis undam</L>

<BIBL>Aeneid. iii. 203.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The foregoing rule may be extended to form a &s;ixth, That no epithet ought to be given to the figurative &s;en&s;e of a word that agrees not al&s;o with its proper &s;en&s;e:
<Q><L>&mdash;Dicat Opuntiae</L>

<P>Seventhly, The crowding into one pe|riod or thought different figures of &s;peech, is not le&s;s faulty than crowding metaphors in that manner. The mind is di&s;tracted in the quick tran&s;ition from one image to ano|ther, and is puzzled in&s;tead of being plea|&s;ed:

<BIBL>Horat. Carm. lib. 1. ode 27.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Eighthly, If crowding figures be bad, it is &s;till wor&s;e to graft one figure upon ano|ther. For in&s;tance,
<Q><L>While his keen falchion drinks the warriors lives.</L>
<BIBL>Iliad xi. 211.</BIBL></Q>
A falchion drinking the warriors blood is a figure built upon re&s;emblance, which is pa&s;&s;able. But then in the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>lives</HI> is again put for blood; and by thus grafting one figure upon another the expre&s;&s;ion is rendered ob&s;cure and unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Ninthly, Intricate and involved figures, that can &s;carce be analized or reduced to plain language, are lea&s;t of all tolerable:

<P>In the tenth place, When a &s;ubject is in|troduced by its proper name, it is ab&s;urd to attribute to it the properties of a different &s;ubject to which the word is &s;ometimes ap|ply'd in a figurative &s;en&s;e:
<Q><L>Hear me, oh Neptune! thou who&s;e arms are hurl'd</L>

<PB N="167" REF="166">
Neptune is here introduced per&s;onally, and not figuratively for the ocean: the de&s;crip|tion therefore, which is only applicable to the ocean, is altogether improper.</P>
<P>It is not &s;ufficient, that a figure of &s;peech be regularly con&s;tructed, and be free from blemi&s;h: it requires ta&s;te to di&s;cern when it is proper when improper; and ta&s;te, I &s;u|&s;pect, is the only guide we can rely on. One however may gather from reflection and ex|perience, that ornaments and graces &s;uit not any of the di&s;piriting pa&s;&s;ions, nor are pro|per for expre&s;&s;ing any thing grave and im|portant. In familiar conver&s;ation, they are in &s;ome mea&s;ure ridiculous. Pro&s;pero in the <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> &s;peaking to his daughter Mi|randa, &s;ays,

<P><PB N="168" REF="167">
In the la&s;t place, though figures of &s;peech have a charming effect when accurately con|&s;tructed and properly introduced, they ought however to be &s;cattered with a &s;paring hand: nothing is more lu&s;cious, and nothing con|&s;equently more &s;atiating, than redundant ornament of any kind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. Narration and De&s;cription.</HEAD>
<P>HORACE, and many writers after him, give in&s;tructions for chu&s;ing a &s;ubject adapted to the genius of the author. But rules of critici&s;m would be end|le&s;s, did one de&s;cend to peculiarities in ta|lent or genius. The aim of the pre&s;ent work is, to con&s;ider human nature in gene|ral, and to explore what is common to the &s;pecies. The choice of a &s;ubject comes not under &s;uch a plan: but the manner of exe|cution comes under it; becau&s;e the manner of execution is &s;ubjected to general rules The&s;e rules re&s;pect the things expre&s;&s;ed, as well as the language or expre&s;&s;ion; which &s;ugge&s;ts a divi&s;ion of the pre&s;ent chapter into two parts; fir&s;t of thoughts, and next of words. I pretend not to ju&s;tify this di|vi&s;ion as entirely accurate. In di&s;cour&s;ing
<PB N="170" REF="169">
of the thoughts, it is difficult to ab&s;tract al|together from words; and &s;till more diffi|cult, in di&s;cour&s;ing of the words, to ab&s;|tract altogether from thought.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ob&s;ervation is, That the thoughts which embelli&s;h a narration ought to be cha&s;te and &s;olid. While the mind is intent upon facts, it is little di&s;po&s;ed to the opera|rations of the imagination. Poetical ima|ges in a grave hi&s;tory are intolerable; and yet Strada's Belgic hi&s;tory is full of poetical images. The&s;e being di&s;cordant with the &s;ubject, are di&s;gu&s;tful; and they have a &s;till wor&s;e effect, by giving an air of fiction to a genuine hi&s;tory. Such flowers ought to be &s;cattered with a &s;paring hand, even in epic poetry; and at no rate are they proper, till the reader be warmed, and by an enlivened imagination be prepared to reli&s;h them: in that &s;tate of mind, they are extremely a|greeable. But while we are &s;edate and at|tentive to an hi&s;torical chain of facts, we reject with di&s;dain every fiction. This Belgic hi&s;tory is indeed wofully vicious both in matter and form: it is &s;tuffed with
<PB N="171" REF="170">
frigid and unmeaning reflections, as well as with poetical fla&s;hes, which, even laying a&s;ide the impropriety, are mere tin&s;el.</P>
<P>Vida<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poet. lib. 2. l. 30.</NOTE>, following Horace, recommends a mode&s;t commencement of an epic poem; giving for a rea&s;on, that the writer ought to hu&s;band his fire. This rea&s;on has weight; but what is &s;aid above &s;ugge&s;ts a rea&s;on &s;till more weighty: Bold thoughts and figures are never reli&s;hed till the mind be heated and thoroughly engaged, which is not the reader's ca&s;e at the commence|ment. Shake&s;pear, in the fir&s;t part of his hi&s;tory of Henry VI. begins with a &s;enti|ment too bold for the mo&s;t heated imagi|nation:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Bedford.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hung be the heav'ns with black, yield day to night!</L>
<L>Comets, importing change of times and &s;tates,</L>
<L>Brandi&s;h your cry&s;tal tre&s;&s;es in the &s;ky,</L>
<L>And with them &s;courge the bad revolting &s;tars.</L>
<L>That have con&s;ented unto Henry's death!</L>
<L><PB N="172" REF="171">
Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</L>
<L>England ne'er lo&s;t a king of &s;o much worth.</L>
</SP></Q>
The pa&s;&s;age with which Strada begins his hi&s;tory, is too poetical for a &s;ubject of that kind; and at any rate too high for the be|ginning of a grave performance. A third rea&s;on ought to have not le&s;s influence than either of the former: A man who, upon his fir&s;t appearance, endeavours to exhibit all his talents, is never reli&s;hed; the fir&s;t periods of a work ought therefore to be &s;hort, natural, and &s;imple. Cicero, in his oration <HI>pro Archia poeta,</HI> errs again&s;t this rule: his reader is out of breath at the very fir&s;t period, which &s;eems never to end. Burnet begins the hi&s;tory of his own times with a period long and intricate.</P>
<P>A third rule or ob&s;ervation is, That where the &s;ubject is intended for entertain|ment &s;olely, not for in&s;truction, a thing ought to be de&s;cribed as it appears, not as it is in reality. In running, for example, the impul&s;e upon the ground is accurately pro|portioned to the celerity of motion: in ap|pearance
<PB N="173" REF="172">
it is otherwi&s;e; for a per&s;on in &s;wift motion &s;eems to &s;kim the ground, and &s;carcely to touch it. Virgil, with great ta&s;te, de&s;cribes quick running according to its appearance; and thereby rai&s;es an image far more lively, than it could have been by adhering &s;crupulou&s;ly to truth:
<Q><L>Hos &s;uper advenit Vol&s;ca de gente Camilla,</L>
<L>Agmen agens equitum et florentes aere catervas,</L>
<L>Bellatrix: non illa colo calathi&s;ve Minervae</L>
<L>Foemineas a&s;&s;ueta manus; &s;ed praelia virgo</L>
<L>Dura pati, cur&s;uque pedum praevertere ventos.</L>
<L>Illa vel intactae &s;egetis per &s;umma volaret</L>
<L>Gramina: nec teneras cur&s;u lae&s;i&s;&s;et ari&s;tas:</L>
<L>Vel mare per medium, fluctu &s;u&s;pen&s;a tumenti,</L>
<L>Ferret iter; celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas.</L>
<BIBL>Aeneid vii. 803.</BIBL></Q>
This example is copied by the author of <HI>Telemachus:</HI>
<Q><P>Les Brutiens &s;ont legeres &agrave; la cour&s;e comme les cerfs, et comme les daims. On croiroit que l'herbe m&ecirc;me la plus tendre n'e&s;t point foul&eacute;e &s;ous leurs pieds; &agrave; peine lai&s;&s;ent ils dans le &s;able quel|ques traces de leurs pas.</P>

Again,
<Q><P>D&eacute;ja il avoit abattu Eu&s;ilas &s;i l&eacute;ger &agrave; la cour&s;e, qu'&agrave; peine il imprimoit la trace de &s;es pas dans le &s;able, et qui devan&ccedil;oit dans &s;on pays les plus ra|pides flots de l'Eurotas et de l'Alph&eacute;e.</P>
<BIBL>Liv. 20.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Fourthly, In narration as well as in de|&s;cription, facts and objects ought to be painted &s;o accurately as to form in the mind of the reader di&s;tinct and lively images. Every u&s;ele&s;s circum&s;tance ought indeed to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e every &s;uch circum|&s;tance loads the narration; but if a circum|&s;tance be nece&s;&s;ary, however &s;light, it can|not be de&s;cribed too minutely. The force of language con&s;i&s;ts in rai&s;ing complete ima|ges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 1. &s;ect. 6.</NOTE>; which cannot be done till the read|er, forgetting him&s;elf, be tran&s;ported as by magic into the very place and time of the important action, and be converted, as it were, into a real &s;pectator, beholding every thing that pa&s;&s;es. In this view, the narra|tive in an epic poem ought to rival a picture
<PB N="175" REF="174">
in the liveline&s;s and accuracy of its repre|&s;entations: no circum&s;tance mu&s;t be omit|ted that tends to make a complete image; becau&s;e an imperfect image, as well as any other imperfect conception, is cold and un|interre&s;ting. I &s;hall illu&s;trate this rule by &s;everal examples, giving the fir&s;t place to a beautiful pa&s;&s;age from Virgil.

The <HI>Henriade</HI> of Voltaire errs greatly a|gain&s;t the foregoing rule: every thing is touched in a &s;ummary way, without ever de&s;cending to the circum&s;tances of an event. This manner is good in a general hi&s;tory,
<PB N="179" REF="178">
the purpo&s;e of which is to record important tran&s;actions: but in a fable, which hath a very different aim, it is cold and unintere&s;t|ing; becau&s;e it is impracticable to form di&s;tinct images of per&s;ons or things repre|&s;ented in a manner &s;o &s;uperficial.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved above, that every u&s;ele&s;s circum&s;tance ought to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. To deal in &s;uch circum&s;tances, is a fault, on the one hand, not le&s;s to be avoided, than the conci&s;ene&s;s for which Voltaire is blamed, on the other. In the <HI>Aeneid</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4. l. 632.</NOTE>, Barce, the nur&s;e of Sichaeus, whom we never hear of before or after, is introduced for a purpo&s;e not more important than to call Anna to her &s;i&s;ter Dido. And that it might not be thought unju&s;t in Dido, even in this trivial incident, to prefer her hu&s;band's nur&s;e be|fore her own, the poet takes care to in|form his reader, that Dido's nur&s;e was dead.

<P>Rea&s;ons that are common and known to every per&s;on, ought to be taken for granted: to expre&s;s them is childi&s;h and interrupts the narration. Quintus Curtius, relating the bat|tle of I&s;&s;us:
<Q><P>Jam in con&s;pectu, &s;ed extra teli jactum, utraque acies erat; quum priores Per&s;ae inconditum et tru|cem &s;u&s;tulere clamorem.

<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed what ob&s;ervations oc|curred upon the thoughts or things expre&s;|&s;ed, I proceed to what more peculiarly con|cern the language or verbal dre&s;s. The lan|guage proper for expre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion is the &s;ubject of a former chapter. Several ob&s;er|vations there made, are applicable to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject; particularly, That words are
<PB N="188" REF="187">
intimately connected with the ideas they re|pre&s;ent, and that the repre&s;entation cannot be perfect unle&s;s the emotions rai&s;ed by the &s;ound and the &s;en&s;e be concordant. It is not &s;ufficient, that the &s;en&s;e be clearly expre&s;|&s;ed: the words mu&s;t corre&s;pond to the &s;ub|ject in every particular. An elevated &s;ub|ject requires an elevated &s;tyle: what is fa|miliar, ought to be familiarly expre&s;&s;ed: a &s;ubject that is &s;erious and important, ought to be cloathed in plain nervous language: a de&s;cription, on the other hand, addre&s;&s;ed to the imagination, is &s;u&s;ceptible of the high|e&s;t ornaments that &s;ounding words, meta|phor, and figurative expre&s;&s;ion, can be|&s;tow upon it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give a few examples of the fore|going doctrine. A poet of any genius will not readily dre&s;s a high &s;ubject in low words; and yet blemi&s;hes of this kind are found e|ven in &s;ome cla&s;&s;ical works. Horace ob|&s;erving that men, perfectly &s;atisfied with them&s;elves, are &s;eldom &s;o with their condi|tion, introduces Jupiter indulging to each his own choice:
<Q><PB N="189" REF="188">

Jupiter in wrath puffing up both cheeks, is a ludicrous expre&s;&s;ion, far from &s;uitable to the gravity of the &s;ubject: every one mu&s;t feel the di&s;cordance. The following cou|plet, &s;inking far below the &s;ubject, is not le&s;s ludicrous.

<P>The language of Homer is &s;uited to his &s;ubject, not le&s;s accurately than the actions and &s;entiments of his heroes are to their characters. Virgil, in this particular, falls &s;hort of perfection: his language is &s;tately throughout; and though he de&s;cends at times to the &s;imple&s;t branches of cookery, roa&s;ting and boiling for example, yet he ne|ver relaxes a moment from the high tone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Aeneid. lib. i. 188.&mdash;219.</NOTE>. In adju&s;ting his language to his &s;ubject, no writer equals Swift. I can recollect but one exception, which at the &s;ame time is far
<PB N="195" REF="194">
from being gro&s;s. The journal of a mo|dern lady, is compo&s;ed in a &s;tyle where &s;prightline&s;s is blended with familiarity, perfectly &s;uited to the &s;ubject. In one pa&s;|&s;age, however, the poet a&s;&s;umes a higher tone, which corre&s;ponds neither to the &s;ub|ject nor to the tone of language employ'd in the re&s;t of that piece.

<P>It is proper to be ob&s;erved upon this head, that writers of inferior rank are continually upon the &s;tretch to enliven and enforce their &s;ubject by exaggeration and &s;uperlatives. This unluckily has an effect oppo&s;ite to what is intended: the reader, di&s;gu&s;ted with language that &s;wells above the &s;ubject, is led by contra&s;t to think more meanly of the &s;ubject than it may po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve. A man of prudence, be&s;ide, will be not le&s;s careful to hu&s;band his &s;trength in writing than in walking: a writer too liberal of &s;u|perlatives, exhau&s;ts his whole &s;tock upon ordinary incidents, and re&s;erves no &s;hare to

expre&s;s, with greater energy, matters of importance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Montaigne, reflecting upon the then pre&s;ent modes, ob|&s;erves, that there never was at any other time &s;o abject and &s;ervile pro&s;titution of words in the addre&s;&s;es made by people of fa&s;hion to one another; the humble&s;t tenders of life and &s;oul, no profe&s;&s;ions under that of devotion and adoration; the wri|ter con&s;tantly declaring him&s;elf a va&s;&s;al, nay a &s;lave: &s;o that when any more &s;erious occa&s;ion of friend&s;hip or gratitude requires more genuine profe&s;&s;ions, words are wanting to ex|pre&s;s them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The power that language po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es to i|mitate thought, goes farther than to the ca|pital circum&s;tances above mentioned: it reacheth even the &s;lighter modifications.

No per&s;on of reflection but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that an inci|dent makes a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on an eye-witne&s;s, than when heard at &s;econd hand. Writers of genius, &s;en&s;ible that the eye is the be&s;t avenue to the heart, repre|&s;ent every thing as pa&s;&s;ing in our &s;ight; and from readers or hearers, transform us, as it were, into &s;pectators. A &s;kilful writer conceals him&s;elf, and pre&s;ents his per&s;on|ages. In a word, every thing becomes dra|matic as much as po&s;&s;ible. Plutarch, <HI>de gloria Athenien&s;ium,</HI> ob&s;erves, that Thucy|dides makes his reader a &s;pectator, and in|&s;pires him with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions as if he were an eye-witne&s;s. I am intitled to
<PB N="198" REF="197">
make the &s;ame ob&s;ervation upon our coun|tryman Swift. From this happy talent a|ri&s;es that energy of &s;tyle which is peculiar to him: he cannot always avoid narration; but the pencil is his choice, by which he be&s;tows life and colouring upon his objects. Pope is richer in ornament, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not in the &s;ame degree the talent of draw|ing from the life. A tran&s;lation of the &s;ixth &s;atire of Horace, begun by the former and fini&s;hed by the latter, affords the faire&s;t opportunity for a compari&s;on. Pope ob|viou&s;ly imitates the picture&s;que manner of his friend: yet every one of ta&s;te mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the imitation, though fine, falls &s;hort of the original. In other in&s;tan|ces, where Pope writes in his own &s;tyle, the difference of manner is &s;till more con|&s;picuous.</P>

It was one of Homer's advantages, that he wrote before general terms were multiplied: the &s;uperior genius of Shake&s;pear di&s;plays it&s;elf in avoid|ing them after they were multiplied. Ad|di&s;on de&s;cribes the family of Sir Roger de Coverley in the following words.

The repetitions in Homer, which are fre|quent, have been the occa&s;ion of much cri|tici&s;m. Suppo&s;e we were at a lo&s;s about the rea&s;on, might not ta&s;te be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify them? At the &s;ame time, one mu&s;t be devoid of under&s;tanding not to be &s;en|&s;ible, that they make the narration drama|tic; and give an air of truth, by making things appear as pa&s;&s;ing in our &s;ight.</P>
<P>A conci&s;e comprehen&s;ive &s;tyle is a great ornament in narration; and a &s;uperfluity of unnece&s;&s;ary words, not le&s;s than of circum|&s;tances, a great nui&s;ance. A judicious &s;e|lection of the &s;triking circum&s;tances, cloath|ed in a nervous &s;tyle, is delightful. In this &s;tyle, Tacitus excels all writers, ancient and modern. In&s;tances are numberle&s;s: take the following &s;pecimen.
<Q><P>Crebra hinc praelia, et &s;aepius in modum latroci|nii: per &s;altus, per paludes; ut cuique fors aut virtus: temere, provi&s;o, ob iram, ob praedam, ju&s;|&s;u, et aliquando ignaris ducibus.</P>

<P>I clo&s;e this chapter with a curious in|quiry. An object, however ugly to the &s;ight, is far from being &s;o when repre|&s;ented by colours or by words. What is the cau&s;e of this difference? The cau&s;e with re&s;pect to painting is obvious. A good picture, whatever the &s;ubject be, is agree|able, becau&s;e of the plea&s;ure we take in imi|tation: the agreeablene&s;s of imitation over|balances the di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the &s;ubject; and the picture upon the whole is agree|able. It requires a greater compa&s;s to ex|plain the cau&s;e with re&s;pect to the de&s;cription of an ugly object. To connect individuals in the &s;ocial &s;tate, no one particular contri|butes more than language, by the power it

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of an expeditious communication of thought and a lively repre&s;entation of tran&s;actions.

And this un|folds the my&s;tery; for the plea&s;ure of lan|guage is &s;o great, as in a lively de&s;cription to overbalance the di&s;agreeablene&s;s of the image rai&s;ed by it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 4.</NOTE>.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. Epic and Dramatic Compo&s;itions.</HEAD>
<P>TRAGEDY differs from the epic more in form than in &s;ub&s;tance. The ends propo&s;ed by each are in&s;truc|tion and amu&s;ement; and each of them co|py human actions as means to bring about the&s;e ends. They differ in the manner on|ly of copying. Epic poetry deals in narra|tion: Tragedy repre&s;ents its facts as tran&s;|acted in our &s;ight. In the former, the poet introduces him&s;elf as an hi&s;torian: in the latter he pre&s;ents his actors and never him|&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The dialogue in a dramatic compo&s;ition &s;eparates it &s;o clearly from other compo&s;itions, that no writer has thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;earch for any other di&s;tingui&s;hing mark. But much u&s;ele&s;s labour has been be&s;towed, to di&s;tingui&s;h an epic poem by &s;ome &s;uch mark. Bo&s;&s;u defines this poem to be, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A compo&s;ition in ver&s;e, intended to form the manners by in|&s;tructions di&s;gui&s;ed under the allegories of an importantaction,"</Q> which will exclude every epic poem founded upon real facts, and perhaps include &s;everal of E&s;op's fables. Voltaire reckons ver&s;e &s;o e&s;&s;ential, as for that &s;ingle rea&s;on to exclude the ad|ventures of Telemachus. See his <HI>E&s;&s;ay upon Epic Poetry.</HI> Others, affected with &s;ub&s;tance more than with ornament, he|&s;itate not to pronounce that poem to be epic. It is not a little diverting, to &s;ee &s;o many &s;hallow critics hunting for what is not to be found. They always take for granted, without the lea&s;t foundation, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome preci&s;e criterion to di&s;tingui&s;h epic poetry from every other &s;pecies of writing. Literary compo&s;itions run into each other, preci&s;ely like co|lours: in their &s;trong tints they are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed; but are &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;o much variety, and take on &s;o many dif|ferent forms, that we never can &s;ay where one &s;pecies ends and another begins. As to the general ta&s;te, there is little rea&s;on to doubt, that a work where heroic actions are rela|ted in an elevated &s;tyle, will, without further requi&s;ite, be deemed an epic poem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="218">
This difference, regarding form only, may be thought &s;light; but the effects it occa&s;ions, are by no means &s;o. What we &s;ee, makes a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion than what we learn from others. A narrative poem is a &s;tory told by another: facts and inci|dents pa&s;&s;ing upon the &s;tage, come under our own ob&s;ervation; and are be&s;ide much enlivened by action and ge&s;ture, expre&s;&s;ive of many &s;entiments beyond the reach of language</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="219">
A dramatic compo&s;ition has another pro|perty, independent altogether of action. A dialogue makes a deeper impre&s;&s;ion than a narration: becau&s;e in the former per&s;ons ex|pre&s;s their own &s;entiments; whereas in the latter &s;entiments are related at &s;econd hand. For that rea&s;on, Ari&s;totle, the father of critics, lays it down as a rule, That in an e|pic poem the author ought to take every opportunity to introduce his actors, and to confine the narrative part within the narrow|e&s;t bounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poet. ch. 25. &s;ect. 6.</NOTE>. Homer under&s;tood perfect|ly the advantage of this method; and his poems are both of them in a great mea&s;ure dramatic. Lucan runs to the oppo&s;ite ex|treme; and is guilty of a &s;till greater fault: the <HI>Phar&s;alia</HI> is &s;tuffed with cold and lan|guid reflections; the merit of which the au|thor a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf, and deigns not to &s;hare with his per&s;onages. Nothing can be more impertinent, than a chain of &s;uch re|flections, which &s;u&s;pend the battle of Phar|&s;alia after the leaders had made their &s;peech|es,
<PB N="221" REF="220">
and the two armies are ready to en|gage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7. from line 385. to line 460.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle, from the nature of the fable, divides tragedy into &s;imple and complex. But it is of greater moment, with re&s;pect to dramatic as well as epic poetry, to found a di&s;tinction upon the different ends attained by &s;uch compo&s;itions. A poem, whether dramatic or epic, that hath no tendency be|yond moving the pa&s;&s;ions and exhibiting pictures of virtue and vice, may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of <HI>pathetic.</HI> But where a &s;tory is purpo&s;ely contrived to illu|&s;trate &s;ome important le&s;&s;on of morality, by &s;howing the natural connection betwixt di&s;|orderly pa&s;&s;ions and external misfortunes, &s;uch compo&s;ition may be denominated <HI>mo|ral</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame di&s;tinction is applicable to that &s;ort of fable which is &s;aid to be the invention of Ae&s;op. A moral, it is true, is by all critics con&s;idered as e&s;&s;ential to &s;uch a fable. But nothing is more common, than to be led blindly by authority. Of the numerous collections I have &s;een, the fables that clear|ly inculcate a moral, make a very &s;mall part. In many fables, indeed, proper pictures of virtue and vice are exhibited: but the bulk of the&s;e collections convey no in&s;truction, nor afford any amu&s;ement beyond what a child receives in reading an ordinary &s;tory.</NOTE>. It indeed conveys moral in&s;truc|tion
<PB N="222" REF="221">
with a per&s;picuity that is not exceeded by the mo&s;t accurate rea&s;oning; and makes a deeper impre&s;&s;ion than any moral di&s;|cour&s;e can do. To be &s;atisfied of this, we need but reflect, that a man who&s;e affec|tions are ju&s;tly balanced, hath a better chance to e&s;cape misfortunes, than one who is a &s;lave to every pa&s;&s;ion. Indeed, no|thing is more evident, than the natural connection that vice hath with mi&s;ery, and virtue with happine&s;s; and &s;uch connec|tion may be illu&s;trated, by &s;tating a fact as well as by urging an argument. Let us a&s;|&s;ume, for example, the following moral truths, That di&s;cord among the chiefs, ren|ders ineffectual all common mea&s;ures; and that the con&s;equences of a &s;lightly-founded quarrel, fo&s;tered by pride and arrogance, are not le&s;s fatal than tho&s;e of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t injury. The&s;e truths may be inculcated, by the quar|rel betwixt Agamemnon and Achilles at the &s;iege of Troy. In this view, it ought to be the poet's chief aim, to invent proper cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="223" REF="222">
pre&s;enting to our view the na|tural con&s;equences of &s;uch di&s;cord. The&s;e circum&s;tances mu&s;t &s;eem to ari&s;e in the com|mon cour&s;e of human affairs: no acciden|tal or unaccountable event ought to be in|dulged; for the nece&s;&s;ary or probable con|nection betwixt vice and mi&s;ery, is learned from no events but what are governed by the characters and pa&s;&s;ions of the per&s;ons repre&s;ented. A real event of which we &s;ee no cau&s;e, may be a le&s;&s;on to us; becau&s;e what hath happened may again happen: but this cannot be inferred from a &s;tory that is known to be fictitious.</P>
<P>Many are the good effects of &s;uch com|po&s;itions. A pathetic compo&s;ition, whe|ther epic or dramatic, tends to a habit of virtue, by exciting emotions that produce good actions, and avert us from tho&s;e that are vicious or irregular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 3.</NOTE>. It likewi&s;e, by its frequent pictures of human woes, hu|manizes the mind, and fortifies us in bear|ing our own misfortunes. A moral com|po&s;ition mu&s;t obviou&s;ly produce the &s;ame good effects, becau&s;e by being moral it doth
<PB N="224" REF="223">
not cea&s;e to be pathetic. It enjoys be&s;ide an excellence peculiar to it&s;elf: for it not only improves the heart, as above mention|ed, but in&s;tructs the head by the moral it contains. For my part, I cannot imagine any entertainment more &s;uited to a rational being, than a work thus happily illu&s;trating &s;ome moral truth; where a number of per|&s;ons of different characters are engaged in an important action, &s;ome retarding, others promoting, the great cata&s;trophe; and where there is dignity of &s;tyle as well as of matter. A work of this kind, has our &s;ympathy at command, and can put in mo|tion the whole train of the &s;ocial affections. We have at the &s;ame time great mental en|joyment, in perceiving every event and e|very &s;ubordinate incident connected with its proper cau&s;e. Our curio&s;ity is by turns ex|cited and gratified; and our delight is con|&s;ummated at the clo&s;e, upon finding, from the characters and &s;ituations exhibited at the commencement, that every circum&s;tance down to the final cata&s;trophe is natural, and that the whole in conjunction make a regu|lar chain of cau&s;es and effects.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="224">
Con&s;idering an epic and dramatic poem as the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance, and having the &s;ame aim or end, it might be thought that they are equally fitted for the &s;ame &s;ubjects. But con&s;idering their difference as to form, there will be found rea&s;on to correct that thought, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree. Many &s;ubjects may indeed be treated with equal advantage in either form; but the &s;ubjects are &s;till more numerous for which one of the forms is better qualified than the other; and there are &s;ubjects proper for the one and not for the other. To give &s;ome &s;light notion of the difference, as there is no room here for enlarging upon every article, I ob|&s;erve, that dialogue is better qualified for expre&s;&s;ing &s;entiments, and narrative for di&s;|playing facts. The&s;e peculiarities tend to confine each within certain limits. He|roi&s;m, magnanimity, undaunted courage, and the whole tribe of the elevated virtues, figure be&s;t in action: tender pa&s;&s;ions and the whole tribe of &s;ympathetic affections, figure be&s;t in &s;entiment. What we feel is the mo&s;t remarkable in the latter: what we perform is the mo&s;t remarkable in the
<PB N="226" REF="225">
former. It clearly follows, that tender pa&s;&s;ions are more peculiarly the province of tragedy, grand and heroic actions of epic poetry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Racine, tender &s;entiments prevail; in Corneille, grand and heroic manners. Hence clearly the preference of the former before the latter, as dramatic poets. Corneille would figure better in an heroic poem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have no occa&s;ion to &s;ay more upon the epic, con&s;idered as peculiarly adapted to certain &s;ubjects. But as dramatic &s;ubjects are more complex, I mu&s;t take a narrower view of them; which I do the more wil|lingly, in order to clear a point thrown into great ob&s;curity by critics.</P>
<P>In the chapter of emotions and pa&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Part 4.</NOTE>, it is occa&s;ionally &s;hown, that the &s;ubject be&s;t fitted for tragedy is the &s;tory of a man who has him&s;elf been the cau&s;e of his mi&s;|fortune. But this man mu&s;t neither be deeply guilty nor altogether innocent. The misfortune mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by a fault in|cident to human nature, and therefore ve|nial. Misfortunes of this kind, call forth the whole force of the &s;ocial affections, and
<PB N="227" REF="226">
intere&s;t the &s;pectator in the warme&s;t man|ner. An accidental misfortune, if not ex|termely &s;ingular, doth not greatly move our pity. The per&s;on who &s;uffers, being inno|cent, is freed from the greate&s;t of all tor|ments, <HI>viz.</HI> the angui&s;h of mind occa&s;ioned by remor&s;e:
<Q><L>Poco &eacute; fune&s;ta</L>
<L>Laltrui fortuna,</L>
<L>Quando non re&s;ta</L>
<L>Ragione alcuna</L>
<L>Ne di pentir&s;i, n&eacute; darro&s;&s;ir.</L>
<BIBL>Meta&s;ta&s;io.</BIBL></Q>
A criminal, on the other hand, who brings misfortunes upon him&s;elf, excites little pity, for a different rea&s;on. His re|mor&s;e, it is true, aggravates his di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;wells the fir&s;t emotions of pity: but then our hatred to the criminal blending with pi|ty, blunts its edge con&s;iderably. Misfor|tunes that are not innocent nor highly cri|minal, partake the advantages of each ex|treme: they are attended with remor&s;e to embitter the di&s;tre&s;s, which rai&s;es our pity to a great height; and the &s;light indignation we have at a venial fault, detracts not &s;en|&s;ibly
<PB N="228" REF="227">
from our pity. For this rea&s;on, the happie&s;t of all &s;ubjects for tragedy, if &s;uch a one could be invented, would be where a man of integrity falls into a great misfortune by doing an innocent action, but which by &s;ome &s;ingular means he conceives to be criminal. His remor&s;e aggravates his di|&s;tre&s;s; and our compa&s;&s;ion, unre&s;trained by indignation, ri&s;es to its highe&s;t pitch. Pity comes thus to be the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of a pa|thetic tragedy; and by proper repre&s;enta|tion, may be rai&s;ed to a height &s;carce ex|ceeded by any thing felt in real life. A moral tragedy takes in a larger field; for, be&s;ide exerci&s;ing our pity, it rai&s;es another pa&s;&s;ion, &s;elfi&s;h indeed, but which de&s;erves to be cheri&s;hed equally with the &s;ocial af|fections. When a misfortune is the natu|ral con&s;equence of &s;ome wrong bias in the temper, every &s;pectator who is con&s;cious of &s;ome &s;uch defect in him&s;elf, takes the a|larm, and con&s;iders that he is liable to the &s;ame misfortune. This con&s;ideration rai&s;es in him an emotion of fear or terror; and it is by this emotion, frequently reiterated in a variety of moral tragedies, that the
<PB N="229" REF="228">
&s;pectators are put upon their guard again&s;t the di&s;orders of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The commentators upon Ari&s;totle and o|ther critics, have been much graveled a|bout the account given of tragedy by this author, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That by means of pity and terror it refines in us all &s;orts of pa&s;&s;ion."</Q> But no one who has a clear conception of the end and effects of a good tragedy, can have any difficulty about Ari&s;totle's meaning. Our pity is engaged for the per&s;ons repre&s;ented, and our terror is upon our own account. Pity indeed is here made to &s;tand for all the &s;ympathetic emotions, becau&s;e of the&s;e it is the capital. There can be no doubt, that our &s;ympathetic emotions are refined or im|proved by daily exerci&s;e; and in what man|ner our other pa&s;&s;ions are refined by terror I have ju&s;t now &s;aid. One thing is certain, that no other meaning can ju&s;tly be given to the foregoing doctrine than that now mentioned; and that it was really Ari&s;totle's meaning, appears from his 13th chapter, where he delivers &s;everal propo&s;itions agree|able to the doctrine as here explained. The&s;e, at the &s;ame time, I the rather chu&s;e
<PB N="230" REF="229">
to mention; becau&s;e, &s;o far as authority can go, they confirm the foregoing rea&s;on|ing about the proper &s;ubjects for tragedy. His fir&s;t propo&s;ition is, That it being the province of tragedy to excite pity and ter|ror, an innocent per&s;on falling into adver&s;i|ty ought never to be the &s;ubject. This propo&s;ition is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of his doctrine as explained: a &s;ubject of this nature may indeed excite pity and terror; but the former in an inferior de|gree, and the latter in no degree for moral in&s;truction. The &s;econd propo&s;ition is, That we mu&s;t not repre&s;ent a wicked per|&s;on emerging from mi&s;ery to good fortune. This excites neither terror nor compa&s;&s;ion, nor is agreeable in any re&s;pect. The third is, That the misfortunes of a wicked per&s;on ought not to be repre&s;ented. Such repre&s;entation may be agreeable in &s;ome mea&s;ure upon a principle of ju&s;tice: but it will not move our pity; or any degree of ter|ror, except in tho&s;e of the &s;ame vicious di&s;po|&s;ition with the per&s;on repre&s;ented. His la&s;t propo&s;ition is, That the only character fit for
<PB N="231" REF="230">
repre&s;entation lies in the middle, neither e|minently good nor eminently bad; where the misfortune is not the effect of delibe|rate vice, but of &s;ome involuntary fault, as our author expre&s;&s;es it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If one can be amu&s;ed with a grave di&s;cour&s;e which pro|mi&s;eth much and performs nothing, he may &s;ee this &s;ubject treated by Brumoy in his <HI>Theatre Grec.</HI> Preliminary di&s;cour&s;e on the origin of tragedy.</NOTE>. The only objec|tion I find to Ari&s;totle's account of tragedy, is, that he confines it within too narrow bounds, by refu&s;ing admittance to the pa|thetic kind. For if terror be e&s;&s;ential to tragedy, no repre&s;entation de&s;erves that name, but where the misfortunes exhibited are cau&s;ed by a wrong balance of mind, or &s;ome di&s;order in the internal con&s;titution. Such misfortunes always &s;ugge&s;t moral in|&s;truction; and by &s;uch misfortunes only can terror be excited for our improvement.</P>
<P>Thus Ari&s;totle's four propo&s;itions above mentioned, relate &s;olely to tragedies of the moral kind. Tho&s;e of the pathetic kind, are not confined within &s;o narrow limits. Subjects fitted for the theatre, are not in &s;uch plenty, as to make us reject innocent
<PB N="232" REF="231">
misfortunes which rou&s;e our &s;ympathy, though they inculcate no moral. With re|&s;pect to &s;ubjects of this kind, it may indeed be a doubtful que&s;tion, whether the con|clu&s;ion ought not always to be happy. Where a per&s;on of integrity is repre&s;ented as &s;uffering to the end under misfortunes purely accidental, we depart di&s;contented, and with &s;ome ob&s;cure &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice; for &s;eldom is man &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the cour&s;e of Providence, as not to revolt again&s;t the tyranny and vexations of blind chance: he will be inclined to &s;ay, This ought not to be. I give for an example the <HI>Romeo and Juliet</HI> of Shake&s;pear, where the fatal cata&s;trophe is occa&s;ioned by Friar Laurence's coming to the monument a minute too late. Such a &s;tory we think of with regret: we are vexed at the unlucky chance, and go away di&s;&s;atisfied. This is a temper of mind which ought not to be cheri&s;hed; and for that rea&s;on, I vote for excluding &s;tories of this kind from the theatre. The misfor|tunes of a virtuous per&s;on ari&s;ing from ne|ce&s;&s;ary cau&s;es, or from a chain of unavoid|able circum&s;tances, will, I am apt to think,
<PB N="233" REF="232">
be con&s;idered in a different light. Chance affords always a gloomy pro&s;pect, and in every in&s;tance gives an impre&s;&s;ion of anar|chy and mi&s;rule. A regular chain, on the other hand, of cau&s;es and effects, directed by the general laws of nature, never fails to &s;ugge&s;t the hand of Providence; to which we &s;ubmit without re&s;entment, being con|&s;cious that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is our duty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See e&s;&s;ays on the principles of morality, edit. 2. p. 291.</NOTE>. For that rea&s;on, we are not di&s;&s;atisfied with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Voltaire's <HI>Mariamne,</HI> though redoubled on her till the moment of her death, without the lea&s;t fault or failing on her part. Her misfortunes are owing to a cau&s;e extremely natural, and not unfre|quent, the jealou&s;y of a barbarous hu&s;band. The fate of De&s;demona in the <HI>Moor of Ve|nice,</HI> affects us in the &s;ame manner. We are not &s;o ea&s;ily reconciled to the fate of Cordelia in <HI>King Lear:</HI> the cau&s;es of her misfortune, are by no means &s;o evident, as to exclude the gloomy notion of chance. In &s;hort, it appears, that a perfect charac|ter &s;uffering under misfortunes is qualified
<PB N="234" REF="233">
for being the &s;ubject of a pathetic tragedy, provided chance be excluded. Nor is it altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with a moral trage|dy: it may &s;ucce&s;sfully be introduced as an under-part, &s;uppo&s;ing the chief place to be filled with an imperfect character from which a moral can be drawn. This is the ca&s;e of De&s;demona and Mariamne ju&s;t now mentioned; and it is the ca&s;e of Monimia and Belvidera, in Otway's two tragedies, <HI>The Orphan,</HI> and <HI>Venice pre&s;erv'd.</HI></P>
<P>I had an early opportunity to unfold a curious doctrine, That fable operates on our pa&s;&s;ions, by repre&s;enting its events as pa&s;&s;|ing in our &s;ight, and by deluding us into a conviction of reality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 6.</NOTE>. Hence, in epic and dramatic compo&s;itions, it is of importance to employ every means that may promote the delu&s;ion, &s;uch as the borrowing from hi&s;tory &s;ome noted event, with the addition of circum&s;tances that may an&s;wer the au|thor's purpo&s;e. The principal facts are known to be true; and we are di&s;po&s;ed to extend our belief to every circum&s;tance.
<PB N="235" REF="234">
But in chu&s;ing a &s;ubject that makes a figure in hi&s;tory, greater precaution is nece&s;&s;ary than where the whole is invented. In the fir&s;t place, no circum&s;tances mu&s;t be added, but &s;uch as connect naturally with what are known to be true: hi&s;tory may be &s;up|plied, but it mu&s;t not be contradicted. In the next place, a pure fable, entirely new with re&s;pect to the per&s;ons as well as the incidents, may be &s;uppo&s;ed an ancient or a modern &s;tory. But if the poet build upon truth, the &s;ubject he chu&s;es mu&s;t be di&s;tant in time, or at lea&s;t in place; for he ought by all means to avoid the familiarity of per&s;ons and events nearly connected with us. Familiarity ought more e&s;pecially to be avoided in an epic poem, the peculiar character of which is dignity and elevation. Modern manners make but a poor figure in &s;uch a poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would not from this ob&s;ervation be thought to underva|lue modern manners. The roughne&s;s, plainne&s;s, and impe|tuo&s;ity of ancient manners, may &s;how better in an epic poem, without being better fitted for &s;ociety. But without regard to this circum&s;tance, it is the familiarity of modern manners that unqualifies them for a lofty &s;ubject. The dignity of our pre|&s;ent manners, will be better under&s;tood in &s;uture ages when they have become ancient.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="235">
After Voltaire, no writer, it is probable, will think of erecting an epic poem upon a recent event in the hi&s;tory of his own country. But an event of this kind is per|haps not altogether unqualified for tragedy. It was admitted in Greece, and Shake&s;pear has employ'd it &s;ucce&s;sfully in &s;everal of his pieces. One advantage it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es above fiction, that of more readily engaging our belief, which tends above any other parti|cular to rai&s;e our &s;ympathy. The &s;cene of comedy is generally laid at home: famili|arity is no objection; and we are peculiarly &s;en&s;ible of the ridicule of our own manners.</P>
<P>After a proper &s;ubject is cho&s;en, there appears to me &s;ome delicacy in dividing it into parts. The conclu&s;ion of a book in an epic poem, or of an act in a play, cannot be altogether arbitrary; nor be intended for &s;o &s;light a purpo&s;e as to make the parts of equal length. The &s;uppo&s;ed pau&s;e at the end of every book, and the real pau&s;e at the end of every act, ought always to coincide with &s;ome pau&s;e in the action. In this re|&s;pect,
<PB N="237" REF="236">
a dramatic or epic poem, ought to re&s;emble a &s;entence or period in language, divided into members that are di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by regular pau&s;es: or it ought to re&s;emble a piece of mu&s;ic, having a full clo&s;e at the end, preceded by imper|fect clo&s;es that contribute to the melody. Every act therefore ought to clo&s;e with &s;ome incident that makes a pau&s;e in the action; for otherwi&s;e there can be no pretext for in|terrupting the repre&s;entation. It would be ab&s;urd to break off in the very heat of action: again&s;t this every one would exclaim. The ab&s;urdity &s;till remains, though the action relents, if it be not actually &s;u&s;pended for &s;ome time. This rule is al&s;o applicable to an epic poem; though there a deviation from the rule is le&s;s remarkable, becau&s;e it is in the reader's power to hide the ab|&s;urdity, by proceeding in&s;tantly to another book. The fir&s;t book of the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> ends without any regular clo&s;e, perfect or imperfect: it breaks off abruptly, where Satan, &s;eated on his throne, is prepared to make a &s;peech to the convocated ho&s;t of the fall'n angels; and the &s;econd book be|gins

<P>Hitherto I have carried on together the epic and dramatic compo&s;itions. I proceed to handle them &s;eparately, and to mention circum&s;tances peculiar to each, beginning with the epic kind. In a theatrical enter|tainment, which employs both the eye and the ear, it would be a mon&s;trous ab|&s;urdity to introduce upon the &s;tage invi&s;ible beings in a vi&s;ible &s;hape. But it has been much di&s;puted, whether &s;uch beings may not be properly introduced in an epic poem. If we re&s;t upon the authority of practice, we mu&s;t declare for the affirmative; and Boileau<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Third part of his art of poetry.</NOTE>, among many other critics, is a &s;tout champion for this &s;ort of machinery. But waving authority, which is apt to im|po&s;e
<PB N="239" REF="238">
upon the judgement, let us draw what light we can from rea&s;on. I begin with a preliminary remark, That this matter is but indi&s;tinctly handled by critics. It is laid down above, that &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions incite the mind to animate its objects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 20. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>: the moral virtues become &s;o many godde&s;&s;es, and even darts and arrows are in&s;pired with life and action. But then it mu&s;t not be overlook|ed, that &s;uch per&s;onification, being the work of imagination, is de&s;criptive only, and a&s;&s;umes not even an appearance of truth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. This is very different from what is termed <HI>machinery,</HI> where deities, angels, devils, or other &s;upernatural powers, are introduced as real per&s;onages, mixing in the action, and contributing to the cata&s;tro|phe; and yet the&s;e two things are con|&s;tantly jumbled together in the rea&s;oning. The poetical privilege of animating in&s;en|&s;ible objects for the &s;ake of de&s;cription, can|not be controverted, becau&s;e it is founded on a natural principle. But has the privi|lege of machinery, if it be a privilege, the
<PB N="240" REF="239">
&s;ame good foundation? Far from it: no|thing can be more unnatural. Its effects, at the &s;ame time, are deplorable. Fir&s;t, it gives an air of fiction to the whole; and prevents that impre&s;&s;ion of reality which is requi&s;ite to intere&s;t our affections, and to move our pa&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 6.</NOTE>. This of it&s;elf is &s;uffi|cient to explode machinery, whatever en|tertainment it may give to readers of a fan|ta&s;tic ta&s;te or irregular imagination. And next, were it po&s;&s;ible to di&s;gui&s;e the fiction, and to delude us into a notion of reality, which I think can hardly be, an in&s;uper|able objection would &s;till remain, which is, that the aim or end of an epic poem can never be accompli&s;hed in any perfection where machinery is introduced. Virtuous emotions cannot be rai&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sfully but by the actions of tho&s;e who are endued with pa&s;&s;ions and affections like our own, that is, by human actions. And as for moral in|&s;truction, it is evident, that we can draw none from beings who act not upon the &s;ame principles with us. A fable in Ae&s;op's
<PB N="241" REF="240">
manner is no objection to this rea&s;oning. His lions, bulls, and goats, are truly men under di&s;gui&s;e: they act and feel in every re&s;pect as human beings; and the moral we draw is founded on that &s;uppo&s;ition. Homer, it is true, introduces the gods into his fable; and he was authori&s;ed to take that liberty by the religion of his country; it being an article in the Grecian creed, that the gods often interpo&s;e vi&s;ibly and bodily in human affairs. I mu&s;t however ob|&s;erve, that Homer's deities do no honour to his poems. Fictions that tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of nature, &s;eldom have a good ef|fect: they may inflame the imagination for a moment, but will not be reli&s;hed by any per&s;on of a correct ta&s;te. Let me add, that of whatever u&s;e &s;uch fictions may be to a mean genius, an able writer has much finer materials of Nature's production for eleva|ting his &s;ubject, and making it intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Boileau, a &s;trenuous advocate for the Heathen deities, as ob&s;erved, declares a|gain&s;t angels and devils, though &s;upported by the religious creed of his country. One would be apt to imagine, that a critic fa|med
<PB N="242" REF="241">
for his good ta&s;te, could have no other meaning than to ju&s;tify the employing Hea|then deities for enlivening or elevating the de&s;cription. But as the Heathen deities make not a better figure in poetical lan|guage than angels and devils, Boileau, in pleading for the former, certainly meant, if he had any di&s;tinct meaning, that the&s;e may be introduced as actors. And, in fact, he him&s;elf is guilty of this glaring ab&s;urdi|ty, where it is not &s;o pardonable as in an epic poem. In his ode upon the taking of Na|mur, he demands with a mo&s;t &s;erious countenance, whether the walls were built by Apollo or Neptune; and in relating the pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine, <HI>anno</HI> 1672, he de|&s;cribes the god of that river as fighting with all his might to oppo&s;e the French mo|narch. This is confounding fiction with reality at a &s;trange rate. The French wri|ters in general run into this error: wonder|ful! that they &s;hould not be &s;en&s;ible how ridiculous it is.</P>
<P>That this is a capital error in the <HI>Gieru|&s;alleme liberata,</HI> Ta&s;&s;o's greate&s;t admirers mu&s;t acknowledge. A &s;ituation can never
<PB N="243" REF="242">
be intricate, nor the reader ever in pain a|bout the cata&s;trophe, &s;o long as there is an angel, devil, or magician, to lend a helping hand. Voltaire, in his e&s;&s;ay upon epic poe|try, talking of the <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> ob&s;erves judi|ciou&s;ly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the proximity of time, the notoriety of events, the character of the age, enlightened and political, joined with the &s;olidity of Lucan's &s;ubject, de|prived him of all liberty of poetical fic|tion."</Q> Is it not amazing, that a critic who rea&s;ons &s;o ju&s;tly with re&s;pect to others; can be &s;o blind with re&s;pect to him&s;elf? Voltaire, not &s;atisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invi&s;ible and &s;upe|rior beings, introduces them into the ac|tion. In the &s;ixth canto of the <HI>Henriade,</HI> St Louis appears in per&s;on, and terrifies the &s;oldiers; in the &s;eventh canto, St Louis &s;ends the god of Sleep to Henry; and, in the tenth, the demons of Di&s;cord, Fanati|ci&s;m, War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t Aumale in a &s;ingle combat with Turenne, and are cha&s;ed a|way by a good angel brandi&s;hing the &s;word of God. To blend &s;uch fictitious per&s;on|ages in the &s;ame action with mortals,
<PB N="244" REF="243">
makes a bad figure at any rate; and is in|tolerable in a hi&s;tory &s;o recent as that of Henry IV. This &s;ingly is &s;ufficient to make the <HI>Henriade</HI> a &s;hort-liv'd poem, were it o|therwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every beauty. I have tried &s;erious rea&s;oning upon this &s;ubject; but ridicule, I &s;uppo&s;e, will be found a more &s;ucce&s;sful weapon, which Addi&s;on has ap|plied in an elegant manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whereas the time of a general peace is, in all ap|pearance, drawing near; being informed that there are &s;everal ingenious per&s;ons who intend to &s;hew their talents on &s;o happy an occa&s;ion, and being willing, as much as in me lies, to prevent that effu&s;ion of non&s;en&s;e which we have good cau&s;e to apprehend; I do hereby &s;trictly re|quire every per&s;on who &s;hall write on this &s;ubject, to remember that he is a Chri&s;tian, and not to &s;acrifice his cate|chi&s;m to his poetry. In order to it, I do expect of him in the fir&s;t place, to make his own poem, without depending upon Phoebus for any part of it, or call|ing out for aid upon any of the mu|&s;es by name. I do likewi&s;e po&s;itively
<PB N="245" REF="244">
forbid the &s;ending of Mercury with any particular me&s;&s;age or di&s;patch relating to the peace; and &s;hall by no means &s;uffer Minerva to take upon her the &s;hape of any plenipotentiary concerned in this great work. I do further declare, that I &s;hall not allow the de&s;tinies to have had an hand in the deaths of the &s;everal thou&s;ands who have been &s;lain in the late war; being of opinion that all &s;uch deaths may be very well accounted for by the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem of powder and ball. I do therefore &s;trictly forbid the fates to cut the thread of man's life upon any pretence what&s;oever, unle&s;s it be for the &s;ake of the rhyme. And whereas I have good rea&s;on to fear, that Neptune will have a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s on his hands in &s;everal poems which we may now &s;uppo&s;e are upon the anvil, I do al&s;o prohibit his appearance, unle&s;s it be done in metaphor, &s;imile, or any very &s;hort allu&s;ion; and that even here he be not permitted to enter, but with great caution and circum&s;pection.

<P>The marvellous is indeed &s;o much pro|moted by machinery, that it is not won|derful to find it embraced by the bulk of writers, and perhaps of readers. If indul|ged at all, it is generally indulged to ex|ce&s;s. Homer introduces his deities with no greater ceremony than his mortals; and Virgil has &s;till le&s;s moderation: an over|watched pilot cannot fall a&s;leep and drop into the &s;ea by natural means: the two

<P>Angels and devils &s;erve equally with the Heathen deities, as materials for figurative language, perhaps better among Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e we believe in them, and not in the Heathen deities. But every one is &s;en&s;ible, as well as Boileau, that the invi&s;ible powers in our creed make a much wor&s;e figure as actors in a modern poem, than the invi&s;i|ble powers in the Heathen creed did in an|cient poems. The rea&s;on I take to be what follows. The Heathen deities, in the opi|nion of their votaries, were beings elevated one &s;tep only above mankind, actuated by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, and directed by the &s;ame motives; therefore not altogether improper to mix with mankind in an important ac|tion. In our creed, &s;uperior beings are placed at &s;uch a mighty di&s;tance from us, and are of a nature &s;o different, that with no propriety can they appear with us upon the &s;ame &s;tage. Man is a creature &s;o much in|ferior,
<PB N="248" REF="247">
that he lo&s;es all dignity when &s;et in oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to be no doubt, that an hi&s;torical poem admits the embelli&s;hment of allegory, as well as of metaphor, &s;imile, or other figure. Moral truth, in particular, is finely illu&s;trated in the allegorical manner. It amu&s;es the fancy to find ab&s;tract terms, by a &s;ort of magic, converted into active beings; and it is delightful to trace a gene|ral propo&s;ition in a pictured event. But allegorical beings &s;hould be confined within their own &s;phere; and never be admitted to mix in the principal action, nor to co-o|perate in retarding or advancing the cata&s;tro|phe. This would have a &s;till wor&s;e effect, than the introduction of invi&s;ible powers; and I am ready to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on. An hi&s;torical fable affords entertainment chiefly by making us conceive its per&s;onages to be really exi&s;ting and acting in our pre&s;ence: in an allegory, this agreeable delu&s;ion is denied; for we mu&s;t not imagine an alle|gorical per&s;onage to be a real being, but the figure only of &s;ome virtue or vice; other|wi&s;e the allegory is lo&s;t. The impre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="249" REF="248">
of real exi&s;tence, e&s;&s;ential to an epic poem, is incon&s;i&s;tent with that figurative exi&s;tence which is e&s;&s;ential to an allegory; and there|fore no method can be more effectual to de&s;troy the impre&s;&s;ion of reality, than to introduce allegorical beings co-operating with tho&s;e whom we conceive to be really exi&s;ting. The love-epi&s;ode in the <HI>Hen|riade</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Canto 9.</NOTE>, is in&s;ufferable by the di&s;cordant mixture of allegory with real life. This epi&s;ode is copied from that of Rinaldo and Armida in the <HI>Gieru&s;alemme liberata,</HI> which hath no merit to intitle it to be copied. An allegorical object, &s;uch as fame in the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and the temple of love in the <HI>Hen|riade,</HI> may find place in a de&s;cription: but to introduce Di&s;cord as a real per&s;onage, imploring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Love as another real per&s;onage, to enervate the courage of the hero, is making the&s;e figurative be|ings act beyond their &s;phere, and creating a &s;trange jumble of di&s;cordant materials, <HI>viz.</HI> truth and fiction. The allegory of Sin and Death in the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> is, I pre|&s;ume,
<PB N="250" REF="249">
not generally reli&s;hed, though it is not entirely of the &s;ame nature with what I have been condemning. The <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> is not confined to the hi&s;tory of our fir&s;t parents; and in a work comprehending the atchievements of &s;uperior beings, there is more room for fancy than where it is con|fined to human actions.</P>
<P>What is the true notion of an epi&s;ode? or how is it to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from what is really a part of the principal action? Every incident that promotes or retards the cata|&s;trophe, mu&s;t be a part of the principal ac|tion. This clears the nature of an epi&s;ode; which may be defined, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An incident con|nected with the principal action, but which contributes not either to advance or retard it."</Q> The de&s;cent of Aeneas into hell doth not advance or retard the cata|&s;trophe; and therefore is an epi&s;ode. The &s;tory of Ni&s;us and Euryalus, producing an alteration in the affairs of the contending parties, is a part of the principal action. The family-&s;cene in the &s;ixth book of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is of the &s;ame nature: by Hector's retiring from the field of battle to vi&s;it his
<PB N="251" REF="250">
wife, the Grecians got liberty to breathe, and even to pre&s;s upon the Trojans. It being thus the nature of an epi&s;ode to break the unity of action, it ought never to be indulged unle&s;s to refre&s;h and unbend the mind after the fatigue of a long narra|tion. This purpo&s;e of an epi&s;ode demands the following properties. It ought to be well connected with the principal action: it ought to be &s;hort: and it ought to be lively and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Next, upon the peculiarities of a dramatic poem. And the fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is a double plot; being naturally led to it by what is &s;aid immediately above. One of the&s;e double plots mu&s;t be of the nature of an epi&s;ode in an epic poem; for it would di&s;tract the &s;pectator, in&s;tead of entertain|ing him, if he were forc'd to attend, at the &s;ame time, to two capital plots equally in|tere&s;ting. An under-plot in a tragedy has &s;eldom a good effect; becau&s;e a pa&s;&s;ionate piece cannot be too &s;imple. The &s;ympa|thetic emotions once rou&s;ed, cling to their objects, and cannot bear interruption:
<PB N="252" REF="251">
when a &s;ubject fills the mind, it leaves no room for any &s;eparate concern<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Racine, in his preface to the tragedy of <HI>Berenice,</HI> is &s;en&s;ible, that &s;implicity is a great beauty in tragedy, but mi&s;|takes the cau&s;e. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nothing (&s;ays he) but veri&s;imilitude plea|&s;es in tragedy: but where is the veri&s;imilitude, that within the compa&s;s of a day, events &s;hould be crowded which commonly are extended through months?"</Q> This is mi&s;ta|king the accuracy of imitation for the probability or improba|bility of future events. I explain my&s;elf. The veri&s;imilitude required in tragedy, is that the actions corre&s;pond to the manners, and the manners to nature. When this re&s;emblance is pre&s;erved, the imitation is ju&s;t, becau&s;e it is a true copy of nature. But I deny that the veri&s;imilitude of future events, meaning the probability of future events, is any rule in tra|gedy. A number of extraordinary events, are, it is true, &s;eldom crowded within the compa&s;s of a day: but what &s;el|dom happens may happen; and when &s;uch events fall out, they appear not le&s;s natural than the mo&s;t ordinary accidents. To make veri&s;imilitude in the &s;en&s;e of probability a governing rule in tragedy, would annihilate this &s;ort of writing altoge|ther; for it would exclude all extraordinary events, in which the life of tragedy con&s;i&s;ts. It is very improbable or unlikely, pitching upon any man at random, that he will &s;acrifice his life and fortune for his mi&s;tre&s;s or for his country: yet when this event happens, &s;uppo&s;ing it agreeable to the character, we recognize the veri&s;imilitude as to nature, whatever want of veri&s;imilitude or of probability there was <HI>a priori</HI> that &s;uch would be the event.</NOTE>. Variety is more tolerable in comedy, which pretends only to amu&s;e, without totally occupying
<PB N="253" REF="252">
the mind. But even here, to make a dou|ble plot agreeable, a good deal of art is re|qui&s;ite. The under-plot ought not to vary greatly in its tone from that which is prin|cipal: pa&s;&s;ions may be varied, but di&s;cor|dant pa&s;&s;ions are unplea&s;ant when jumbled together. This is a &s;olid objection to tragi|comedy. For this rea&s;on, I blame the <HI>Provok'd Hu&s;band:</HI> all the &s;cenes that bring the family of the Wrongheads into action, being ludicrous and farcical, agree very ill with the &s;harpne&s;s and &s;everity of the principal &s;ubject, exhibiting the di&s;cord betwixt Lord Townly and his lady. The &s;ame objection touches not the double plot of the <HI>Carele&s;s Hu&s;band:</HI> the different &s;ubjects are &s;weetly connected; and have only &s;o much variety as to re&s;emble &s;hades of colours harmoniou&s;ly mixed. But this is not all. The under plot ought to be con|nected with the principal action, &s;o as to employ the &s;ame per&s;ons: the intervals or pau&s;es of the principal action ought to be filled with the under-plot; and both ought to be concluded together. This is the ca&s;e of the <HI>Merry Wives of Wind&s;or.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="253">
Violent action ought to be excluded from the &s;tage. While the dialogue runs on, a thou&s;and particulars concur to delude us into an impre&s;&s;ion of reality; genuine &s;entiments, pa&s;&s;ionate language, and per|&s;ua&s;ive ge&s;ture. The &s;pectator once enga|ged, is willing to be deceived, lo&s;es &s;ight of him&s;elf, and without &s;cruple enjoys the &s;pectacle as a reality. From this ab&s;ent &s;tate, he is rou&s;ed by violent action: he wakes as from a plea&s;ing dream, and ga|thering his &s;en&s;es about him, finds all to be a fiction. Horace delivers the &s;ame rule; and founds it upon the rea&s;on given:
<Q><L>Ne pueros coram populo Medea trucidet;</L>
<L>Aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius Atreus;</L>
<L>Aut in avem Progne vertatur, Cadmus in anguem.</L>
<L>Quodcunque o&s;tendis mihi &s;ic, incredulus odi.</L></Q>
The French critics, as it appears to me, mi&s;apprehend the rea&s;on of this rule. Shed|ding blood upon the &s;tage, &s;ay they, is barbarous and &s;hocking to a polite au|dience. This no doubt is an additional rea&s;on for excluding blood&s;hed from the
<PB N="255" REF="254">
French &s;tage, &s;uppo&s;ing the French to be in reality &s;o delicate. But this evidently is not the rea&s;on that weighed with the Greeks: that polite people had no notion of &s;uch delicacy; witne&s;s the murder of Cly|temne&s;tra by her &s;on Ore&s;tes, pa&s;&s;ing be|hind the &s;cene, as repre&s;ented by Sopho|cles. Her voice is heard calling out for mercy, bitter expo&s;tulations on his part, loud &s;hrieks upon her being &s;tabb'd, and then a deep &s;ilence. I appeal to every per|&s;on of feeling, whether this &s;cene be not more horrible, than if the deed had been committed in &s;ight of the &s;pectators upon a &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion. According to the foregoing rea&s;oning of the French critics, there is nothing to exclude from the &s;tage a duel occa&s;ioned by an affair of honour, becau&s;e in it there is nothing barbarous or &s;hocking to a polite audience: yet a &s;cene of this nature is excluded from the French &s;tage; which &s;hows, without more argu|ment, that the&s;e critics have mi&s;apprehend|ed the rule laid down by Horace. If Cor|neille, in repre&s;enting the affair betwixt Horatius and his &s;i&s;ter, upon which murder
<PB N="256" REF="255">
en&s;ues behind the &s;cene, had no other view than to remove from the &s;pectators a &s;cene of horror, he certainly was in a capital mi&s;take: for murder in cold blood, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure was the ca&s;e as repre&s;ented, is more horrible even where the conclu&s;ive &s;tab is not &s;een, than the &s;ame act perform|ed on the &s;tage by violent and unpremedita|ted pa&s;&s;ion, as &s;uddenly repented of as com|mitted. I heartily agree with Addi&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spectator, No. 44.</NOTE>, that no part of this incident ought to have been repre&s;ented, but re&s;erved for a narra|tive, with all the alleviating circum&s;tances po&s;&s;ible in favour of the hero. This is the only method to avoid the difficulties that unqualify this incident for repre&s;entation, a deliberate murder on the one hand, and on the other a violent action performed on the &s;tage, which mu&s;t rou&s;e the &s;pectator from his dream of reality.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h with a few words upon the dialogue; which ought to be &s;o conducted as to be a true repre&s;entation of nature. I
<PB N="257" REF="256">
talk not here of the &s;entiments, nor of the language; for the&s;e come under different heads. I talk of what properly belongs to dialogue-writing; where every &s;ingle &s;peech, &s;hort or long, ought to ari&s;e from what is &s;aid by the former &s;peaker, and furni&s;h matter for what comes after, till the end of the &s;cene. In this view, the whole &s;peeches, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, repre&s;ent &s;o many links, all connected together in one regular chain. No author, ancient or modern, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the art of dialogue equal to Shake&s;pear. Dry|den, in this particular, may ju&s;tly be pla|ced as his oppo&s;ite. He frequently intro|duces three or four per&s;ons &s;peaking upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, each throwing out his own &s;entiments &s;eparately, without regard|ing what is &s;aid by the re&s;t. I give for an ex|ample the fir&s;t &s;cene of <HI>Aurenzebe.</HI> Some|times he makes a number club in relating an event, not to a &s;tranger, &s;uppo&s;ed igno|rant of it, but to one another, for the &s;ake merely of &s;peaking. Of this notable &s;ort of dialogue, we have a &s;pecimen in the fir&s;t &s;cene of the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Conque&s;t of Gra|nada.</HI> In the &s;econd part of the &s;ame tragedy,
<PB N="258" REF="257">
&s;cene &s;econd, the King, Abenamar, and Zulema, make their &s;eparate ob&s;ervations, like &s;o many &s;oliloquies, upon the fluctua|ting temper of the mob. It puts one in mind of a pa&s;toral, where two &s;hepherds are introduced reciting couplets alternately, each in prai&s;e of his own mi&s;tre&s;s, as if they were contending for a prize.</P>
<P>The bandying &s;entiments in this manner, be&s;ide an unnatural air, has another bad ef|fect. It &s;tays the cour&s;e of the action, be|cau&s;e it is not productive of any con&s;equence. In Congreve's comedies, the action is often &s;u&s;pended to make way for a play of wit. But of this more particularly in the chapter immediately following.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. The three Unities.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t chapter unfolds the plea|&s;ure we have in a chain of connect|ed facts. In hi&s;tories of the world, of a country, of a people, this plea&s;ure is but faint; becau&s;e the connections are &s;light or ob&s;cure. We find more entertainment in biography, where the incidents are con|nected by their relation to one per&s;on, who makes a figure and commands our atten|tion. But the greate&s;t entertainment of the kind, is afforded by the hi&s;tory of a &s;ingle e|vent, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be intere&s;ting. The hi&s;tory of one event produceth a more en|tire connection among the parts, than the hi&s;tory of one per&s;on. In the latter, the circum&s;tances are not otherwi&s;e connected than by their relation to that per&s;on: in the
<PB N="260" REF="259">
former, the circum&s;tances are connected by the &s;tronge&s;t of all relations, that of cau&s;e and effect. Thus, the circum&s;tances of a &s;ingle event, having a mutual connection extremely intimate, form a delightful train: we &s;urvey with peculiar plea&s;ure a number of facts that give birth to each other; and we pa&s;s with ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>But this &s;ubject merits a more particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. When we con&s;ider the chain of cau&s;es and effects in the material world, independent of purpo&s;e, de&s;ign, or thought, we find a train of incidents in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, without beginning, middle, or end. Every thing that happens is both a cau&s;e and an effect: it is the effect of &s;omething that goes before, and the cau&s;e of one or many things that follow. One incident may af|fect us more, another le&s;s; but all of them, great and &s;mall, are &s;o many links in the univer&s;al chain. The mind, in viewing the&s;e incidents, cannot re&s;t or &s;ettle ulti|mately upon any one; but is carried along in the train without any clo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="260">
But when the intellectual world is taken under view, in conjunction with the mate|rial, the &s;cene is varied. Man acts with deliberation, will, and choice; he acts with a view to &s;ome end, glory, for example, or riches, or conque&s;t, the procuring happi|ne&s;s to individuals, or to his country in general; and he propo&s;es means and lays &s;chemes to attain the end propo&s;ed. Here is recogni&s;ed a capital end or event, con|nected with &s;ubordinate events or incidents by the relation of cau&s;ation. In running o|ver a &s;eries of &s;ubordinate events, we cannot re&s;t upon any one; becau&s;e they are pre&s;ented to us as means only, leading to &s;ome end. But we re&s;t with &s;atisfaction upon the ulti|mate event; becau&s;e there, the purpo&s;e, the plan, the aim, of the chief per&s;on or per&s;ons, is completed and brought to a final conclu|&s;ion. This indicates a beginning, a middle, and an end, of what Ari&s;totle calls <HI>an entire action</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poet. cap 6. See al&s;o cap. 7.</NOTE>. The &s;tory naturally begins with de&s;cribing tho&s;e circum&s;tances which move the di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;on to form a plan, in
<PB N="262" REF="261">
order to compa&s;s &s;ome de&s;ired event. The pro&s;ecution of that plan, and the ob&s;truc|tions, carry the reader into the heat of ac|tion. The middle is properly where the action is the mo&s;t involved; and the end is where the event is brought about, and the de&s;ign accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>A de&s;ign or plan thus happily perfected, after many ob&s;tructions, affords wonderful delight to the reader. And to produce this delight, a principle mentioned above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 8.</NOTE> mainly contributes; a principle that di&s;po&s;es the mind to complete every work commen|ced, and in general to carry every thing to its ultimate conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have given the foregoing example of a plan laid down and completed, becau&s;e it affords the cleare&s;t conception of a begin|ning, a middle, and an end, in which con|&s;i&s;ts unity of action: and indeed &s;tricter u|nity cannot be imagined than in this ca&s;e. But an action may have unity, or a begin|ning, middle, and end, without &s;o inti|mate a relation of parts. The cata&s;trophe
<PB N="263" REF="262">
may be different from what is intended or de&s;ired; which is frequently the ca&s;e in our be&s;t tragedies. The <HI>Aeneid</HI> is an in&s;tance of means employ'd to produce a certain e|vent, and the&s;e means crowned with &s;uc|ce&s;s. The <HI>Iliad</HI> is formed upon a different model. It begins with the quarrel betwixt Achilles and Agamemnon: it goes on to de&s;cribe the &s;everal effects produced by that cau&s;e; and ends in a reconciliation. Here is unity of action, no doubt, a begin|ning, a middle, and an end: it mu&s;t however be acknowledged, that the <HI>Aeneid</HI> is more happy in point of connection. The mind hath a propen&s;ity to go forward in the chain of hi&s;tory: it keeps always in view the expected event; and when the inci|dents or under-parts are connected together by their relation to the event, the mind runs &s;weetly and ea&s;ily along them. This plea&s;ure we have in the <HI>Aeneid.</HI> But it is not altogether &s;o plea&s;ant, as in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> to connect effects by their common cau&s;e; for &s;uch connection forces the mind to a conti|nual retro&s;pect: looking backward is like walking backward.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="263">
But Homer's plan is &s;till more imperfect, for another rea&s;on, That the events de&s;cri|bed are but imperfectly connected with the wrath of Achilles as their cau&s;e. His wrath did not exert it&s;elf in action; and the mi&s;|fortunes of his countrymen were but nega|tively the effects of his wrath, by depri|ving them of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>If unity of action be a capital beauty in a fable imitative of human affairs, a double action mu&s;t be a capital defect, by carrying on together two trains of unconnected ob|jects. For the &s;ake of variety, we indulge an under-plot that contributes to the prin|cipal event. But two unconnected events are a great deformity; and it le&s;&s;ens the de|formity but a very little, to engage the &s;ame actors in both. Ario&s;to is quite li|centious in this particular: he carries on at the &s;ame time a plurality of unconnected &s;tories. His only excu&s;e is, that his plan is perfectly well adju&s;ted to his &s;ubject; for every thing in the <HI>Orlando Furio&s;o</HI> is wild and extravagant.</P>

If a noted &s;tory, cold and &s;imple in its fir&s;t movements, be made the &s;ubject of an epic poem, the reader may be hurried into the heat of action, re&s;erving the preliminaries for a conver&s;ation-piece, if it &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary.

In <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> two per&s;onages, who afterward are di&s;covered to be the he|roes of the &s;tory, &s;tart up completely armed upon the banks of the Euphrates, and en|gage in a &s;ingle combat<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am &s;en&s;ible that a commencement of this &s;ort is much reli&s;hed by certain readers di&s;po&s;ed to wonder.

But curio&s;ity is at an end with the fir&s;t reading, becau&s;e the per&s;onages are no longer unknown; and therefore at the &s;e|cond reading a commencement &s;o artificial, lo&s;es all its power even over the vulgar.

A play analyzed, is a chain of connected facts, of which each &s;cene makes a link. Each &s;cene, accordingly, ought to produce &s;ome incident relative to the cata&s;trophe or ultimate event, by advancing or retarding it. If no incident be produced, &s;uch a &s;cene, which may be termed barren, ought not to be indulged, becau&s;e it breaks the u|nity of action. A barren &s;cene can never be intitled to a place, becau&s;e the chain is complete without it. In the <HI>Old Bachelor,</HI> the 3d &s;cene of act 2. and all that fol|low to the end of that act, are mere con|ver&s;ation-pieces, without any con&s;equence. The 10th and 11th &s;cenes, act 3. <HI>Double Dealer,</HI> the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th &s;cenes, act 1. <HI>Love for Love,</HI> are of the &s;ame kind. Neither is <HI>The Way of the World</HI> entirely guiltle&s;s of &s;uch &s;cenes. It will be no ju&s;tification, that they help to di&s;play characters. It were better, like
<PB N="267" REF="266">
Dryden, in his <HI>dramatis per&s;onae,</HI> to de|&s;cribe characters beforehand, which would not interrupt the chain of action. But a writer of genius has no occa&s;ion for &s;uch ar|tifice: he can di&s;play the characters of his per&s;onages much more to the life in &s;enti|ment and action. How &s;ucce&s;sfully is this done by Shake&s;pear! in who&s;e works there is not to be found a &s;ingle barren &s;cene.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it appears, that all the facts in an hi&s;torical fable, ought to have a mutual connection by their common rela|tion to the grand event or cata&s;trophe. And this relation, in which the <HI>unity</HI> of action con&s;i&s;ts, is equally e&s;&s;ential to epic and dra|matic compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>How far the unities of time and of place are e&s;&s;ential, is a que&s;tion of greater intricacy. The&s;e unities were &s;trictly ob&s;erved in the Grecian and Roman theatres; and they are inculcated by the French and Engli&s;h cri|tics as e&s;&s;ential to every dramatic compo&s;i|tion. In theory, the&s;e unities are al&s;o ac|knowledged by our be&s;t poets, though their practice is &s;eldom corre&s;pondent: they are often forc'd to take liberties, which they
<PB N="268" REF="267">
pretend not to ju&s;tify, again&s;t the practice of the Greeks and Romans, and again&s;t the &s;olemn deci&s;ion of their own countrymen. But in the cour&s;e of this inquiry it will be made evident, that the example of the ancients ought, upon this point, to have no weight with us, and that our critics are guilty of a mi&s;take, in admitting no greater latitude of place and time than was admitted in Greece and Rome.</P>
<P>Suffer me only to premi&s;e, that the uni|ties of place and time, are not, by the mo&s;t rigid critics, required in a narrative poem. In &s;uch a compo&s;ition, if it pretend to copy nature, the&s;e unities would be ab&s;urd; be|cau&s;e real events are &s;eldom confined within narrow limits either of place or of time. And yet we can follow hi&s;tory, or an hi&s;torical fable, through all its changes, with the greate&s;t facility. We never once think of mea&s;uring the real time by what is taken in reading; nor of forming any connection betwixt the place of action and that which we occupy.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that the drama differs &s;o far from the epic, as to admit different rules.

A view of the Grecian drama, and a compari&s;on betwixt it and our own, may perhaps help to relieve us from this dilem|ma. If they be differently con&s;tructed, as &s;hall by and by be made evident, it is po&s;|&s;ible that the foregoing rea&s;oning may not be applicable with equal force to both. This is an article, that, with relation to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, has not, &s;o far as I know, been examined by any writer.</P>
<P>All authors agree, that the fir&s;t notion of tragedy in Greece, was derived from the hymns in prai&s;e of Bacchus, which were &s;ung in parts by a chorus. The&s;pis, to relieve the &s;ingers, and for the &s;ake of va|riety, introduced one actor; who gave a narrative of the &s;ubject, and &s;ometimes re|pre&s;ented one or other per&s;onage. E&s;chy|lus, introducing a &s;econd actor, formed the dialogue; by which the performance became dramatic: and the actors were multiplied when the &s;ubject repre&s;ented made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary. But &s;till, the chorus, which gave a beginning to tragedy, was con&s;idered as an e&s;&s;ential part of its con&s;titution. In the fir&s;t &s;cene, generally, are unfolded the pre|liminary
<PB N="271" REF="270">
circum&s;tances that lead to the grand event. This &s;cene is by Ari&s;totle termed the <HI>prologue.</HI> In the &s;econd &s;cene, where the action properly begins, the cho|rus is introduced, which, as originally, con|tinues upon the &s;tage during the whole performance. Sophocles adheres to this plan religiou&s;ly. Euripides is not altoge|ther &s;o correct. In &s;ome of his pieces it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to remove the chorus. But this is &s;eldom done; and when done, matters are &s;o ordered as that their ab&s;ence is but momentary. The chorus often mix in the dialogue; and when the dialogue happens to be &s;u&s;pended, the chorus, du|ring the interval, is employ'd in &s;inging. Nor does the removal of the chorus, when that unu&s;ual &s;tep is ri&s;ked, interrupt the repre&s;entation. They never leave the &s;tage of their own accord, but at the command of &s;ome principal per&s;onage who con&s;tantly waits their return.</P>
<P>Thus the Grecian drama is a continued repre&s;entation without any interruption; a circum&s;tance that merits attention. A con|tinued repre&s;entation without a pau&s;e, af|fords
<PB N="272" REF="271">
not opportunity to vary the place of action; and has withal a very &s;hort dura|tion. To a repre&s;entation &s;o confined in place and time, the foregoing rea&s;oning is &s;trictly applicable. A real or feigned ac|tion that is brought to a conclu&s;ion after con&s;iderable intervals of time and frequent change of place, cannot accurately be co|pied in a repre&s;entation that admits of no latitude in either. Hence it is, that the u|nities of place and of time, were, or ought to have been, &s;trictly ob&s;erved in the Grecian tragedies. This is made nece&s;&s;ary by the very con&s;titution of their drama; for it is ab&s;urd to compo&s;e a tragedy that cannot be ju&s;tly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Modern critics, who for our drama pretend to e&s;tabli&s;h rules founded on the practice of the Greeks, are guilty of an egregious blunder. The unities of place and of time, &s;o much vaunted, were in Greece, as we &s;ee, a matter of nece&s;&s;ity, not of choice. I am now ready to &s;how, that if we &s;ubmit to the&s;e fetters, it mu&s;t be from choice not nece&s;&s;ity. This will be evident upon taking a view of the con&s;truc|tion
<PB N="273" REF="272">
of our drama, which differs widely from that of Greece; whether more or le&s;s perfect, is a &s;eparate que&s;tion, which &s;hall be handled afterward. By dropping the chorus, an opportunity is afforded to &s;plit our drama into parts or acts, which in the repre&s;entation are di&s;tingui&s;hed by intervals of time; and during the&s;e in|tervals, the &s;tage is totally evacuated and the &s;pectacle &s;u&s;pended. This con&s;truction qualifies our drama for &s;ubjects &s;pread through a wide &s;pace both of time and of place. The time &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the repre&s;entation, is not mea&s;ured by the time of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; nor is any connection formed, betwixt the box we &s;it in and the place where things are &s;up|po&s;ed to be tran&s;acted in our ab&s;ence: and by that means, many &s;ubjects can be ju&s;tly repre&s;ented in our theatres, for which there was no place in tho&s;e of ancient Greece. This doctrine may be illu&s;trated, by compa|ring a modern play to a &s;et of hi&s;torical pic|tures: let us &s;uppo&s;e them five in number, and the re&s;emblance will be complete. Each of the pictures re&s;embles an act in one
<PB N="274" REF="273">
of our plays. There mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the &s;tricte&s;t unity of place and of time in each picture; and the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity requires the&s;e two unities during each act of a play, becau&s;e during an act there is no interruption in the &s;pectacle. Now, when we view in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion a number of &s;uch hi&s;torical pic|tures, let it be, for example, the hi&s;tory of Alexander by Le Brun, we have no diffi|culty to conceive, that months or years have pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the &s;ubjects exhibited in two different pictures, though the interrup|tion is imperceptible in pa&s;&s;ing our eye from the one to the other. We have as little difficulty to conceive a change of place, however great. In this matter, there is truly no difference betwixt five acts of a modern play and five &s;uch pictures. Where the repre&s;entation is &s;u&s;pended, we can with the greate&s;t facility &s;uppo&s;e any length of time or any change of place. The &s;pecta|tor, it is true, may be con&s;cious, that the real time and place are not the &s;ame with what are employ'd in the repre&s;entation, even including the intervals. But this is a work of reflection; and by the &s;ame reflec|tion
<PB N="275" REF="274">
he may al&s;o be con&s;cious, that Garrick is not King Lear, that the playhou&s;e is not Dover cliffs, nor the noi&s;e he hears thunder and lightning. In a word, during an inter|ruption of the repre&s;entation, it is not more difficult for a &s;pectator to imagine him&s;elf carried from place to place, and from one period of time to another, than at once, when the &s;cene fir&s;t opens, to be carried from London to Rome, or from the pre|&s;ent time two thou&s;and years back. And indeed, it mu&s;t appear ridiculous, that a critic, who makes no difficulty of &s;uppo&s;ing candle-light to be &s;un-&s;hine, and &s;ome painted canva&s;&s;es a palace or a pri&s;on, &s;hould affect &s;o much difficulty in imagining a latitude of place or of time in the &s;tory, beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary in the repre&s;enta|tion.</P>
<P>There are, I acknowledge, &s;ome ef|fects of great latitude in time that ought never to be indulged in a compo&s;ition for the theatre. Nothing can be more ab&s;urd, than at the clo&s;e to exhibit a full grown per&s;on who appears a child at the beginning. The mind rejects as contrary to all proba|bility,
<PB N="276" REF="275">
&s;uch latitude of time as is requi&s;ite for a change &s;o remarkable. The greate&s;t change from place to place hath not altoge|ther the &s;ame bad effect. In the bulk of human affairs place is not material; and the mind, when occupied with an intere&s;ting event, is little regardful of minute circum|&s;tances. The&s;e may be varied at will, be|cau&s;e they &s;carce make any impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But though I have thus taken arms to re&s;cue modern poets from the &s;lavi&s;h fetters of modern critics, I would not be under|&s;tood to ju&s;tify liberty without any re&s;erve. An unbounded licence with relation to place and time, is faulty for a rea&s;on that &s;eems to have been overlooked: it never fails to break in upon the unity of action. In the ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs, &s;ingle e|vents, &s;uch as are fit to be repre&s;ented on the &s;tage, are confined to a narrow &s;pot, and generally employ no great extent of time. We accordingly &s;eldom find &s;trict unity of action in a dramatic compo&s;ition, where any remarkable latitude is indulged in the&s;e particulars. I mu&s;t &s;ay farther, that a compo&s;ition which employs but one
<PB N="277" REF="276">
place, and requires not a greater length of time than is nece&s;&s;ary for the repre&s;enta|tion, is &s;o far the more perfect: becau&s;e the confining an event within &s;o narrow bounds, contributes to the unity of action; and al&s;o prevents that labour, however &s;light, which the mind mu&s;t undergo in imagining fre|quent changes of place and many intervals of time. But &s;till I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t, that the li|mitation of place and time which was ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the Grecian drama, is no rule to us; and therefore that though &s;uch limita|tion adds one beauty more to the compo&s;i|tion, it is at be&s;t but a refinement, which may ju&s;tly give place to a thou&s;and beau|ties more &s;ub&s;tantial. And I may add, that it is extremely difficult, I was about to &s;ay impracticable, to contract within the Gre|cian limits, any fable &s;o fruitful of incidents in number and variety as to give full &s;cope to the fluctuation of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It may now appear, that critics who put the unities of place and of time upon the &s;ame footing with the unity of action, ma|king them all equally e&s;&s;ential, have not at|tended to the nature and con&s;truction of the
<PB N="278" REF="277">
modern drama. If they admit an interrupt|ed repre&s;entation, with which no writer finds fault, it is plainly ab&s;urd to condemn the greate&s;t advantage it procures us, that of repre&s;enting many intere&s;ting &s;ubjects ex|cluded from the Grecian &s;tage. If there needs mu&s;t be a reformation, why not re|&s;tore the ancient chorus and the ancient continuity of action? There is certainly no medium: for to admit an interruption with|out relaxing from the &s;trict unities of place and of time, is in effect to load us with all the inconveniencies of the ancient drama, and at the &s;ame time to with-hold from us its advantages.</P>
<P>And therefore the only proper que&s;tion is, whether our model be or be not a real improvement. This indeed may ju&s;tly be called in que&s;tion; and in order to a fair comparative trial, &s;ome particulars mu&s;t be premi&s;ed. When a play begins, we have no difficulty to enter into the &s;cene of ac|tion, however di&s;tant it be in time or in place. We know that the play is a repre|&s;entation only: and the imagination, with facility, accommodates it&s;elf to every cir|cum&s;tance. Our &s;ituation is very different
<PB N="279" REF="278">
after we are engaged. It is the perfection of repre&s;entation to hide it&s;elf, to impo&s;e upon the &s;pectator, and to produce in him an impre&s;&s;ion of reality, as if he were &s;pec|tator of a real event<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 1. &s;ect. 6.</NOTE>. Any interruption annihilates this impre&s;&s;ion: he is rou&s;ed out of his waking dream, and unhappily re&s;to|red to his &s;en&s;es. So difficult it is to &s;upport this impre&s;&s;ion of reality, that much &s;lighter interruptions than the interval betwixt two acts are &s;ufficient to di&s;&s;olve the charm. In the 5th act of the <HI>Mourning Bride,</HI> the three fir&s;t &s;cenes are in a room of &s;tate; the fourth in a pri&s;on. This change is operated by &s;hifting the &s;cene, which is done in a trice. But however quick the tran&s;ition may be, it is impracticable to impo&s;e upon the &s;pectators &s;o far as to make them con|ceive that they are actually carried from the palace to the pri&s;on. They immediately re|flect, that the palace and pri&s;on are imagi|nary, and that the whole is a fiction.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;&s;es one will be natu|rally led, at fir&s;t view, to declare again&s;t
<PB N="280" REF="279">
the frequent interruptions in the modern drama. It will occur, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That every inter|ruption mu&s;t have the effect to bani&s;h the dream of reality, and with it to ba|ni&s;h our concern, which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t while we are con&s;cious that all is a fic|tion; and therefore that in the modern drama &s;ufficient time is not afforded for the fluctuation and &s;welling of pa&s;&s;ion, like what is afforded in the Grecian dra|ma, where there is no interruption."</Q> This rea&s;oning, it mu&s;t be owned, has a &s;pecious appearance: but we mu&s;t not turn faint-hearted upon the fir&s;t repul&s;e; let us rally our troops for a &s;econd engage|ment.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering attentively the ancient dra|ma, we find, that though the repre&s;enta|tion is never interrupted, the principal ac|tion is &s;u&s;pended not le&s;s frequently than in the modern drama. There are five acts in each; and the only difference is, that in the former, when the action is &s;u&s;pend|ed, as it is at the end of every act, oppor|tunity is taken of the interval to employ the chorus in &s;inging. Hence it appears, that
<PB N="281" REF="280">
the Grecian continuity of repre&s;entation cannot have the effect to prolong the im|pre&s;&s;ion of reality. To bani&s;h this impre&s;|&s;ion, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the action while the chorus is employ'd in &s;inging, is not le&s;s o|perative than a total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion both of the repre&s;entation and action.</P>
<P>But to open a larger view, I am ready to &s;how, that a continued repre&s;entation, with|out a &s;ingle pau&s;e even in the principal ac|tion, &s;o far from an advantage, would be really an imperfection; and that a repre&s;en|tation with proper pau&s;es, is better calcu|lated for moving the audience, and making the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. Repre&s;entation cannot very long &s;upport an impre&s;&s;ion of reality: when the &s;pirits are exhau&s;ted by clo&s;e attention and by the agitation of pa&s;|&s;ion, an unea&s;ine&s;s en&s;ues, which never fails to bani&s;h the waking dream. Now &s;uppo|&s;ing an act to employ as much time as can ea&s;ily be given with &s;trict attention to any incident, a &s;uppo&s;ition that cannot be far from the truth; it follows, that the im|pre&s;&s;ion of reality would not be prolonged beyond the &s;pace of an act, even &s;uppo&s;ing
<PB N="282" REF="281">
a continued repre&s;entation. Hence it ap|pears, that a continued repre&s;entation with|out any pau&s;e, would be a bad contrivance: it would break the attention by over&s;train|ing it, and produce a total ab&s;ence of mind. In this re&s;pect, the four pau&s;es have a fine effect. By affording to the audience a &s;ea|&s;onable re&s;pite when the impre&s;&s;ion of rea|lity is gone, and while nothing material is in agitation, they relieve the mind from its fatigue; and con&s;equently prevent a wan|dering of thought at the very time po&s;&s;ibly of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;cenes.</P>
<P>In one article indeed, the Grecian model has greatly the advantage: its chorus, du|ring an interval, not only pre&s;erves alive the impre&s;&s;ions made upon the audience, but al&s;o prepares their hearts finely for new im|pre&s;&s;ions. In our theatres, on the contra|ry, the audience, at the end of every act, are in a manner &s;olicited to withdraw their thoughts from what has been pa&s;&s;ing, and to trifle away the time the be&s;t way they can. Thus in the intervals betwixt the acts, every warm impre&s;&s;ion is bani&s;hed; and the &s;pectators begin the next act cool and in|different,
<PB N="283" REF="282">
as at the commencement of the play. Here is a gro&s;s malady in our thea|trical repre&s;entations; but a malady that luckily is not incurable. To revive the Grecian chorus, would be to revive the Grecian &s;lavery of place and time. But I can figure a detached chorus coinciding with a pau&s;e in the repre&s;entation, as the ancient chorus did with a pau&s;e in the principal ac|tion. What objection, for example, can there lie again&s;t mu&s;ic betwixt the acts, vo|cal and in&s;trumental, adapted to the &s;ub|ject? Such detached chorus, be&s;ide admit|ting the &s;ame latitude that we enjoy at pre&s;ent as to time and place, would have more than one happy effect: it would re|cruit the &s;pirits; and it would pre&s;erve en|tire, the tone, if not the tide, of pa&s;&s;ion. The mu&s;ic that comes fir&s;t, ought to accord with the tone of the preceding pa&s;&s;ion, and be gradually varied till it accord with the tone of the pa&s;&s;ion that is to &s;ucceed in the next act. The mu&s;ic and the repre&s;en|tation would both of them be gainers by their conjunction; which will thus appear. Mu&s;ic that accords with the pre&s;ent tone
<PB N="284" REF="283">
of mind, is, upon that account, doubly a|greeable; and accordingly, though mu&s;ic &s;ingly hath not power to rai&s;e any pa&s;&s;ion, it tends greatly to &s;upport a pa&s;&s;ion already rai&s;ed. Further, mu&s;ic, though it cannot of it&s;elf rai&s;e a pa&s;&s;ion, prepares us for the pa&s;&s;ion that follows: by making chearful, tender, melancholy, or animated impre&s;|&s;ions, mu&s;ic has power to di&s;po&s;e the heart to various pa&s;&s;ions. Of this power, the fir&s;t &s;cene of the <HI>Mourning Bride</HI> is a &s;hi|ning in&s;tance: without the preparation of &s;oft mu&s;ic in a melancholy &s;train, it would be extremely difficult to enter all at once into Almeria's deep di&s;tre&s;s. In this man|ner, mu&s;ic and repre&s;entation &s;upport each other delightfully: the impre&s;&s;ion made upon the audience by the repre&s;entation, is a fine preparation for the mu&s;ic that &s;ucceeds; and the impre&s;&s;ion made by the mu&s;ic, is a fine preparation for the repre&s;entation that &s;uc|ceeds. It appears to me clear, that, by &s;ome &s;uch contrivance, the modern drama may be improved, &s;o as to enjoy the advantage of the ancient chorus without its &s;lavi&s;h li|mitation of place and time. And as to
<PB N="285" REF="284">
mu&s;ic in particular, I cannot figure any plan that would tend more to its improve|ment. Compo&s;ers, tho&s;e for the &s;tage at lea&s;t, would be reduced to the happy ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;tudying and imitating nature; in&s;tead of indulging, according to the pre|&s;ent fa&s;hion, in wild, fanta&s;tic, and unna|tural conceits. But we mu&s;t return to our &s;ubject, and fini&s;h the compari&s;on betwixt the ancient and the modern drama.</P>
<P>The numberle&s;s improprieties forc'd upon the Grecian dramatic poets by the con&s;titution of their drama, are, of them|&s;elves one &s;hould think, a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for preferring that of the moderns, even ab&s;tracting from the improvement propo&s;ed. To prepare the reader for this article, it mu&s;t be premi&s;ed, that as in the ancient drama the place of action never varies, a place nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be cho&s;en to which every per&s;on may have acce&s;s without any improbability. This confines the &s;cene to &s;ome open place, generally the court or area before a palace; which excludes from the Grecian theatre tran&s;actions within doors, though the&s;e commonly are the mo&s;t
<PB N="286" REF="285">
important. Such cruel re&s;traint is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to cramp the mo&s;t pregnant inven|tion; and accordingly the Grecian writers, in order to pre&s;erve unity of place, are re|duced to woful improprieties. In the <HI>Hippolytus</HI> of Euripides<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 1. &s;c. 6.</NOTE>, Phedra, di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed in mind and body, is carried with|out any pretext from her palace to the place of action, is there laid upon a couch un|able to &s;upport her&s;elf upon her limbs, and made to utter many things improper to be heard by a number of women who form the chorus. What is &s;till wor&s;e, her female at|tendant u&s;es the &s;tronge&s;t intreaties to make her reveal the &s;ecret cau&s;e of her angui&s;h; which at la&s;t Phedra, contrary to decency and probability, is prevailed upon to do in pre&s;ence of this very chorus<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act 2. &s;c. 2.</NOTE>. Alce&s;tes, in <HI>Euripides,</HI> at the point of death, is brought from the palace to the place of ac|tion, groaning and lamenting her untimely fate<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act 2. &s;c. 1.</NOTE>. In the <HI>Trachiniens</HI> of Sophocles<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Act 2.</NOTE>, a &s;ecret is imparted to Dejanira, the wife
<PB N="287" REF="286">
of Hercules, in pre&s;ence of the chorus. In the tragedy of <HI>Iphigenia,</HI> the me&s;&s;enger em|ploy'd to carry Clitemne&s;tra the news that Iphigenia was &s;acrificed, &s;tops &s;hort at the place of action, and with a loud voice calls the Queen from her palace to hear the news. Again, in the <HI>Iphigenia in Tauris,</HI> the nece&s;&s;ary pre&s;ence of the chorus forces Euripides into a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity, which is to form a &s;ecret plot in their hearing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 4. at the clo&s;e.</NOTE>; and to di&s;gui&s;e the ab&s;urdity, much court&s;hip is be&s;towed on the chorus, not one woman but a number, to engage them to &s;ecrecy. In the <HI>Medea</HI> of Euripides, that prince&s;s makes no difficulty, in pre&s;ence of the cho|rus, to plot the death of her hu&s;band, of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and of her father the King of Corinth, all by poi&s;on. It was nece&s;&s;ary to bring Medea upon the &s;tage, and there is but one place of action, which is always occupied by the chorus. This &s;cene clo&s;es the &s;econd act; and in the end of the third, &s;he frankly makes the chorus her confidents in ploting the murder of her own
<PB N="288" REF="287">
children. Terence, by identity of place, is often forc'd to make a conver&s;ation within doors be heard on the open &s;treet: the cries of a woman in labour are there heard di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>The Grecian poets are not more hap|py with re&s;pect to time than with re|&s;pect to place. In the <HI>Hippolytus</HI> of Euri|pides, that prince is bani&s;hed at the end of the fourth act. In the fir&s;t &s;cene of the following act, a me&s;&s;enger relates to The&s;eus the whole particulars of the death of Hippolytus by the &s;ea-mon&s;ter. This remarkable event mu&s;t have employ'd ma|ny hours; and yet in the repre&s;entation it is confined to the time employ'd by the chorus upon the &s;ong at the end of the 4th act. The incon&s;i&s;tency is &s;till greater in the <HI>Iphigenia in Tauris</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 5. &s;c. 4.</NOTE>. The &s;ong could not exhau&s;t half an hour; and yet the in|cidents &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened in that time, could not naturally be tran&s;acted in le&s;s than half a day.</P>
<P>The Grecian arti&s;ts are not le&s;s frequent|ly obliged to tran&s;gre&s;s another rule, derived
<PB N="289" REF="288">
al&s;o from a continued repre&s;entation, which is, that the place of action mu&s;t con&s;tantly be occupied; for the very lea&s;t vacuity is an interruption of the repre&s;entation. Sophocles, with regard to this rule as well as others, is generally correct. But Euripides cannot bear &s;uch re&s;traint: he often evacuates the &s;tage, and leaves it empty for others in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. <HI>Iphigenia in Tauris,</HI> after pronouncing a &s;oliloquy in the fir&s;t &s;cene, leaves the place of action, and is &s;ucceeded by Ore&s;tes and Pylades. They, after &s;ome conver&s;ation, walk off; and Iphi|genia re-enters, accompanied with the cho|rus. In the <HI>Alce&s;tes,</HI> which is of the &s;ame author, the place of action is void at the end of the third act. It is true, that to co|ver this irregularity, and to pre&s;erve the re|pre&s;entation in motion, Euripides is ex|tremely careful to fill the &s;tage without lo&s;s of time. But this is &s;till an interruption, and a link of the chain broken: for during the change of the actors, there mu&s;t always be a &s;pace of time, when we cannot ju&s;tly &s;ay, that the &s;tage is occupied by either &s;et. It makes indeed a more remarkable inter|ruption,
<PB N="290" REF="289">
to change the place of action as well as the actors; but that was not practi|cable upon the Grecian &s;tage.</P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay upon what model Te|rence has formed his plays. Having no chorus, there is a ce&s;&s;ation in the repre&s;en|tation at the end of every act. But advan|tage is not taken of this ce&s;&s;ation, even to vary the place of action. The &s;treet is al|ways cho&s;en, where every thing pa&s;&s;ing may be &s;een by every per&s;on: and by this choice, the mo&s;t &s;prightly and intere&s;ting parts of the action, which commonly pa&s;s within doors, are excluded; witne&s;s the la&s;t act of the <HI>Eunuch.</HI> He hath &s;ubmitted to the &s;ame &s;lavery with re&s;pect to time. In a word, a play with a regular chorus, is not more confined in place and time than his plays are. Thus a zealous &s;ectary follows implicitly ancient forms and ceremonies, without once con&s;idering whether their in|troductive cau&s;e be &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. Plau|tus, of a bolder genius than Terence, makes good u&s;e of the liberty afforded by an interrupted repre&s;entation: he varies the place of action upon all occa&s;ions, when the variation &s;uits his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="290">
The intelligent reader will by this time under&s;tand, that I plead for no change of place in our plays but after an interval, nor for any latitude in point of time but what falls in with an interval. The unities of place and time ought to be &s;trictly ob&s;erved during each act; for during the repre&s;enta|tion, there is no opportunity for the &s;malle&s;t deviation from either. Hence it is an e&s;|&s;ential requi&s;ite, that during an act the &s;tage be always occupied; for even a mo|mentary vacuity makes an interval. An|other rule is not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential: it would be a gro&s;s breach of the unity of action, to ex|hibit upon the &s;tage two &s;eparate actions at the &s;ame time; and therefore to pre&s;erve this unity, it is nece&s;&s;ary that each per&s;on|age introduced during an act, be linked to tho&s;e in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage, &s;o as to join all in one action. The&s;e things follow from the very conception of an act, which admits not the &s;lighte&s;t interruption. The moment the repre&s;entation is intermitted, there is an end of that act; and we have no other notion of a new act, but where after a pau&s;e or interval, the repre&s;entation
<PB N="292" REF="291">
is again put in motion. French writers, generally &s;peaking, are extremely correct in this particular: the Engli&s;h, on the con|trary, are &s;o irregular as &s;carce to de&s;erve a critici&s;m: actors not only &s;ucceed each o|ther in the &s;ame place without connection; but, what is &s;till wor&s;e, they frequently &s;ucceed each other in different places. This change of place in the &s;ame act, ought ne|ver to be indulged; for, be&s;ide breaking the unity of the act, it has a di&s;agreeable effect. After an interval, the mind can readily accommodate it&s;elf to any place that is nece&s;&s;ary, ju&s;t as readily as at the com|mencement of the play; but during the re|pre&s;entation, the mind rejects change of place. From the foregoing cen&s;ure mu&s;t be excepted the <HI>Mourning Bride</HI> of Con|greve, where regularity concurs with the beauty of &s;entiment and of language, to make it one of the mo&s;t complete pieces England has to boa&s;t of I mu&s;t acknowledge, how|ever, that in point of regularity, this ele|gant performance is not altogether unex|ceptionable. In the four fir&s;t acts, the u|nities of place and time are &s;trictly ob&s;erved:
<PB N="293" REF="292">
but in the la&s;t act, there is a capital error with re&s;pect to unity of place. In the three fir&s;t &s;cenes of that act, the place of action is a room of &s;tate, which is changed to a pri&s;on in the fourth &s;cene: the chain of the actors withal is broken; for the per&s;ons in|troduced in the pri&s;on, are different from tho&s;e who made their appearance in the room of &s;tate. This remarkable interrup|tion of the repre&s;entation, makes in effect two acts in&s;tead of one: and therefore, if it be a rule, that a play ought not to con|&s;i&s;t of more acts than five, this performance is &s;o far defective in point of regularity. I may add, that even admitting &s;ix acts, the irregularity would not be altogether removed, without a longer pau&s;e in the re|pre&s;entation than is allowed in the acting; for it requires more than a momentary in|terruption, to enable the imagination rea|dily to accommodate it&s;elf to a new place, or to prorogation of time. In <HI>The Way of the World,</HI> of the &s;ame author, unity of place is pre&s;erved during every act, and a &s;tricter unity of time during the whole play than is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. Gardening and Architecture.</HEAD>
<P>THE books that have been compo&s;ed upon architecture and upon embel|li&s;hing ground, abound in practi|cal in&s;truction nece&s;&s;ary for a mechanic: but in vain would we rummage them for rational principles to improve our ta&s;te. In a general &s;y&s;tem, it might be thought &s;uf|ficient to have unfolded the principles that govern the&s;e and other fine arts, leaving the application to the reader: but as I would neglect no opportunity of illu&s;trating the&s;e principles, I propo&s;e to give a &s;peci|men of their application to gardening and architecture, being favourite arts, though I profe&s;s no peculiar &s;kill in either.</P>
<P>Gardening was at fir&s;t an u&s;eful art: in the garden of Alcinoous, de&s;cribed by Ho|mer, we find nothing done for plea&s;ure
<PB N="295" REF="294">
merely. But gardening is now improved into a fine art; and when we talk of a gar|den without any epithet, a plea&s;ure garden, by way of eminence, is under&s;tood. The garden of Alcinoous, in modern language, was but a kitchen-garden. Architecture has run the &s;ame cour&s;e. It continued ma|ny ages an u&s;eful art merely, before it a&s;pi|red to be cla&s;&s;ed with the fine arts. Archi|tecture therefore and gardening mu&s;t be handled in a twofold view, as being u&s;eful arts as well as fine arts. The reader how|ever will not here expect rules for impro|ving any work of art in point of utility. It is no part of my plan to treat of any u&s;eful art as &s;uch. But there is a beauty in uti|lity; and in di&s;cour&s;ing of beauty, that of u|tility ought not to be neglected. This leads us to con&s;ider gardens and buildings in differ|ent views: they may be de&s;tined for u&s;e &s;olely, for beauty &s;olely, or for both. Such variety in the de&s;tination, be&s;tows upon gardening and architecture a great com|mand of beauties complex not le&s;s than va|rious, which makes it difficult to form an accurate ta&s;te in the&s;e arts. And hence
<PB N="296" REF="295">
that difference and wavering of ta&s;te which is more remarkable here than in any art that has but a &s;ingle de&s;tination.</P>
<P>Architecture and gardening cannot o|therwi&s;e entertain the mind, than by rai&s;ing certain agreeable emotions or feelings; and before we de&s;cend to particulars, the&s;e arts &s;hall be pre&s;ented in a general view, by &s;howing what are the emotions or feelings that can be rai&s;ed by them. Poetry, as to its power of rai&s;ing emotions, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ju&s;tly the fir&s;t place among the fine arts; for &s;carce one emotion of human nature is be|yond its reach. Painting and &s;culpture are more circum&s;cribed, having the command of no emotions but what are produced by &s;ight. They are peculiarly &s;ucce&s;sful in expre&s;&s;ing painful pa&s;&s;ions, which are di&s;|play'd by external &s;igns extremely legible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 15.</NOTE>. Gardening, be&s;ide the emotions of beauty by means of regularity, order, proportion, colour, and utility, can rai&s;e emotions of grandeur, of &s;weetne&s;s, of gaiety, melan|choly, wildne&s;s, and even of &s;urpri&s;e or
<PB N="297" REF="296">
wonder. In architecture, regularity, or|der, and proportion, and the beauties that re&s;ult from them, are &s;till more con&s;picuous than in gardening. But with re&s;pect to the beauty of colour, architecture is far inferior. Grandeur can be expre&s;&s;ed in a building, perhaps more &s;ucce&s;sfully than in a garden; but as to the other emotions above men|tioned, architecture hitherto has not been brought to the perfection of expre&s;&s;ing them di&s;tinctly. To balance this defect, archi|tecture can di&s;play the beauty of utility in the highe&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>But gardening po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es one advantage, which never can be equalled in the other art. A garden may be &s;o contrived, as in various &s;cenes to rai&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ively all its dif|ferent emotions. But to operate this deli|cious effect, the garden mu&s;t be exten&s;ive, &s;o as to admit a &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: for a &s;mall garden, comprehended at one view, ought to be confined to one expre&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 8.</NOTE>: it may be gay, it may be &s;weet, it may be gloomy; but an attempt to mix the&s;e, would create
<PB N="298" REF="297">
a jumble of emotions not a little unplea&s;ant. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, a building, even the mo&s;t magnificent, is nece&s;&s;arily confined to one expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Architecture, con&s;idered as a fine art, in&s;tead of rivaling gardening in its progre&s;s toward perfection, &s;eems not far advanced beyond its infant-&s;tate. To bring it to ma|turity, two things mainly are wanted. Fir&s;t, A greater variety of parts and ornaments than it &s;eems provided with. Gardening here has greatly the advantage: it is pro|vided with &s;uch plenty and &s;uch variety of materials, that it mu&s;t be the fault of the arti&s;ts, if the &s;pectator be not entertained with different &s;cenes, and affected with va|rious emotions. But materials in architec|ture are &s;o &s;canty, that arti&s;ts hitherto have not been &s;ucce&s;sful in rai&s;ing emotions, other than tho&s;e of beauty and grandeur. With re&s;pect to the former, there are indeed plenty of means, regularity, order, &s;ymme|try, &s;implicity; and with re&s;pect to the lat|ter, the addition of &s;ize is &s;ufficient. But though it be evident, that every building ought to have a certain character or expre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="299" REF="298">
&s;uitable to its de&s;tination; yet this is a refinement which arti&s;ts have &s;carce ventu|red upon. A death's head and bones em|ploy'd in monumental buildings, will in|deed produce an emotion of gloom and me|lancholy: but every ornament of this kind, if the&s;e can be termed &s;o, ought to be re|jected, becau&s;e they are in them&s;elves di&s;a|greeable. The other thing wanted to bring the art to perfection, is, to a&s;certain the pre|ci&s;e impre&s;&s;ion made by every &s;ingle part and ornament, cupolas, &s;pires, columns, carvings, &s;tatues, va&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For in vain will an arti&s;t attempt rules for employing the&s;e, either &s;ingly or in combination, un|til the different emotions or feelings they produce be di&s;tinctly explained. Garden|ing in this particular hath al&s;o the advan|tage. The &s;everal emotions rai&s;ed by trees, rivers, ca&s;cades, plains, eminences, and o|ther materials it employs, are under&s;tood; and the nature of each can be de&s;cribed with &s;ome degree of preci&s;ion, which is done occa&s;ionally in the foregoing parts of this work.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="299">
In gardening as well as in architecture, &s;implicity ought to be the governing ta&s;te. Profu&s;e ornament hath no better effect than to confound the eye, and to prevent the object from making an impre&s;&s;ion as one entire whole. An arti&s;t de&s;titute of genius for capital beauties, is naturally prompted to &s;upply the defect by crowding his plan with &s;light embelli&s;hments. Hence in gar|dens, triumphal arches, Chine&s;e hou&s;es, temples, obeli&s;ks, ca&s;cades, fountains, with|out end; and hence in buildings, pillars, va&s;es, &s;tatues, and a profu&s;ion of carved work. Thus a woman who has no ju&s;t ta&s;te, is apt to overcharge every part of her dre&s;s with ornament. Superfluity of deco|ration hath another bad effect: it gives the object a diminutive look. An i&s;land in a wide extended lake, makes it appear larger; but an artificial lake, which mu&s;t always be little, appears &s;till le&s;s by making an i&s;land in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See appendix to part 5. chap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In forming plans for embelli&s;hing a field, an arti&s;t void of ta&s;te deals in &s;traight lines,
<PB N="301" REF="300">
circles, &s;quares; becau&s;e the&s;e &s;how be&s;t upon paper. He perceives not, that to hu|mour and adorn nature is the perfection of his art; and that nature, neglecting regula|rity, reacheth &s;uperior beauties by di&s;tribu|ting her objects in great variety with a bold hand. A large field laid out with &s;trict re|gularity, is &s;tiff and artificial. Nature in|deed, in organized bodies comprehended under one view, &s;tudies regularity; which, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, ought to be &s;tudied in architecture: but in large objects, which cannot otherwi&s;e be &s;urveyed than in parts and by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, regularity and uniformi|ty would be u&s;ele&s;s properties, becau&s;e they cannot be di&s;covered by the eye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;quare field appears not &s;uch to the eye when viewed from any part of it; and the centre is the only place where a circular field pre&s;erves in appearance its real figure.</NOTE>. Na|ture therefore, in her large works, neglects the&s;e properties; and in copying nature the arti&s;t ought to neglect them.</P>
<P>Having thus far carried on a compari&s;on betwixt gardening and architecture, I pro|ceed to rules peculiar to each; and I begin
<PB N="302" REF="301">
with gardening. The &s;imple&s;t idea of a garden, is that of a &s;pot embelli&s;hed with a number of natural objects, trees, walks, poli&s;h'd parterres, flowers, &s;treams, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> One more complex comprehends &s;tatues and buildings, that nature and art may be mutually ornamental. A third approach|ing nearer perfection, is of objects a&s;&s;em|bled together, in order to produce, not only an emotion of beauty, e&s;&s;ential to gardens of every kind, but al&s;o &s;ome other particular emotion, grandeur, for example, gaiety, or any other of tho&s;e above mentioned. The mo&s;t perfect idea of a garden is an im|provement upon the third, requiring the adju&s;tment of the &s;everal parts, in &s;uch a manner as to in&s;pire all the different emo|tions that can be rai&s;ed by gardening. In this idea of a garden, the arrangement is an important circum&s;tance; for it has been &s;hown, that &s;ome emotions figure be&s;t in conjunction, and that others ought always to appear in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and never in con|junction. I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 8.</NOTE>, that when the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite emo|tions,
<PB N="303" REF="302">
&s;uch as gloomine&s;s and gaiety, &s;till|ne&s;s and activity, follow each other in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, the plea&s;ure on the whole will be the greate&s;t; but that oppo&s;ite or di&s;&s;imilar emotions ought not to be united, becau&s;e they produce an unplea&s;ant mixture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 4.</NOTE>. For that rea&s;on, a ruin, affording a &s;ort of me|lancholy plea&s;ure, ought not to be &s;een from a flower-parterre, which is gay and chear|ful. But to pa&s;s immediately from an exhilerating object to a ruin, has a glo|rious effect; for each of the emotions is the more &s;en&s;ibly felt by being contra&s;ted with the other. Similar emotions, on the other hand, &s;uch as gaiety and &s;weetne&s;s, &s;tillne&s;s and gloomine&s;s, motion and gran|deur, ought to be rai&s;ed together; for their effects upon the mind are greatly heightened by their conjunction<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the place immediately above cited.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Kent's method of embelli&s;hing a field, is admirable. It is painting a field with beautiful objects, natural and artificial, di&s;|po&s;ed like colours upon a canvas. It re|quires indeed more genius to paint in the
<PB N="304" REF="303">
gardening way. In forming a land&s;cape up|on a canvas, no more is required but to ad|ju&s;t the figures to each other: an arti&s;t who lays out ground in Kent's manner, has an additional ta&s;k, which is to adju&s;t his figures to the &s;everal varieties of the field.</P>
<P>One garden mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a plurality; and yet it is not obvious where|in the unity of a garden con&s;i&s;ts. A notion of unity is indeed &s;ugge&s;ted from viewing a garden &s;urrounding a palace, with views from each window, and walks leading to every corner. But there may be a garden without a hou&s;e. In this ca&s;e, I mu&s;t pro|nounce, that what makes it one garden, is the unity of de&s;ign, every &s;ingle &s;pot ap|pearing part of a whole. The gardens of Ver&s;ailles, properly expre&s;&s;ed in the plural number, being no fewer than &s;ixteen, are indeed all of them connected with the pa|lace, but have &s;carce any mutual connec|tion: they appear not like parts of one whole, but rather like &s;mall gardens in contiguity. Were the&s;e gardens at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, they would have a better effect. Their junction breeds con|fu&s;ion
<PB N="305" REF="304">
of ideas, and upon the whole gives le&s;s plea&s;ure than would be felt in a &s;lower &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Regularity is required in that part of a garden which joins the dwelling-hou&s;e; for being con&s;idered as a more immediate acce&s;&s;ory, it ought to partake the regularity of the principal object<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The influence of this connection &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all bounds, is vi&s;ible in many gardens, left in their original form of horizontal plains forc'd with great labour and ex|pence, perpendicular faces of earth &s;upported with ma&s;&s;y &s;tone walls, terrace-walks in &s;tages one above another, regular ponds and canals without the lea&s;t motion, and the whole &s;ur|rounded, like a pri&s;on, with high walls excluding every ex|ternal object. At fir&s;t view it may puzzle one to account for a ta&s;te running cro&s;s to nature in every particular. But no|thing happens without a cau&s;e. Perfect regularity and uni|formity are required in a hou&s;e; and this idea is extended to its acce&s;&s;ory the garden, e&s;pecially if it be a &s;mall &s;pot inca|pable of grandeur or much variety. The hou&s;e is regular, &s;o mu&s;t the garden be: the floors of the hou&s;e are horizontal, and the garden mu&s;t have the &s;ame po&s;ition: in the hou&s;e we are protected from every intruding eye, &s;o mu&s;t we be in the garden. This, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is carrying the notion of re&s;emblance very far. But where rea&s;on and ta&s;te are laid a&s;leep, nothing is more common than to carry re&s;em|blance beyond proper bounds.</NOTE>. But in proportion to the di&s;tance from the hou&s;e con&s;idered as
<PB N="306" REF="305">
the centre, regularity ought le&s;s and le&s;s to be &s;tudied. In an exten&s;ive plan, it hath a fine effect to lead the mind in&s;en&s;ibly from regularity to a bold variety giving an im|pre&s;&s;ion of grandeur. And grandeur ought to be &s;tudied as much as po&s;&s;ible, even in a more confined plan, by avoiding a multipli|city of &s;mall parts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 4.</NOTE>. Nothing contributes more to grandeur, than a right di&s;po&s;ition of trees. Let them be &s;cattered extremely thin near the dwelling-hou&s;e, and thicken|ed in proportion to their di&s;tance: di&s;tant eminences to be filled with trees, and laid open to view. A &s;mall garden, on the o|ther hand, which admits not grandeur, ought to be &s;trictly regular.</P>

<P>In the manner of planting a wood or thicket, much art may be di&s;play'd. A common centre of walks, termed <HI>a &s;tar,</HI> from whence are &s;een a number of remark|able objects, appears too artificial to be a|greeable. The crowding withal &s;o many objects together, le&s;&s;ens the plea&s;ure that would be felt in a &s;lower &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. A|bandoning therefore the &s;tar, being &s;tiff and formal, let us try to &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome form more natural, that will lay open all the remarkable objects in the neighbour|hood. This may be done by openings in the wood at various di&s;tances, which, in walking, bring &s;ucce&s;&s;ively under the eye every object as by accident. Some o|penings di&s;play &s;ingle objects, &s;ome a plu|rality in a line, and &s;ome a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them. In this plan, the mind at in|tervals is rou&s;ed and cheared by agreeable objects; and the &s;cene is greatly heightened by the &s;urpri&s;e it occa&s;ions when we &s;tumble,
<PB N="308" REF="307">
as it were, upon objects of which we had no expectation.</P>
<P>As gardening is not an inventive art, but an imitation of nature, or rather nature it|&s;elf ornamented; it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that every thing unnatural ought to be rejected with di&s;dain. Statues of wild bea&s;ts vomi|ting water, a common ornament in gardens, prevails in tho&s;e of Ver&s;ailles. Is this or|nament in a good ta&s;te? A <HI>jet d'eau,</HI> being purely artificial, may, without di&s;gu&s;t, be tortured into a thou&s;and &s;hapes: but a re|pre&s;entation of what really exi&s;ts in nature, admits not any unnatural circum&s;tance. The&s;e &s;tatues therefore in the gardens of Ver&s;ailles mu&s;t be condemned: and yet &s;o in&s;en&s;ible has the arti&s;t been to ju&s;t imita|tion, as to have di&s;play'd his vicious ta&s;te without the lea&s;t colour or di&s;gui&s;e. A life|le&s;s &s;tatue of an animal pouring out water, may be endured without much di&s;gu&s;t. But here the lions and wolves are put in violent action: each has &s;eized its prey, a deer or a lamb, in act to devour. And yet, in&s;tead of extended claws and open mouth, the whole, as by a hocus-pocus trick, is con|verted
<PB N="309" REF="308">
into a different &s;cene: the lion, forgetting his prey, pours out water plenti|fully; and the deer, forgetting its danger, performs the &s;ame operation; a repre&s;enta|tion not le&s;s ab&s;urd than that in the opera, where Alexander the Great, after mounting the wall of a town be&s;ieged, turns about and entertains his army with a &s;ong.</P>
<P>In gardening, every lively exhibition of what is beautiful in nature has a fine ef|fect: on the other hand, di&s;tant and faint imitations are di&s;plea&s;ing to every one of ta&s;te. The cutting evergreens in the &s;hape of animals, is a very ancient prac|tice; as appears from the epi&s;tles of Pliny, who &s;eems to be a great admirer of this puerile conceit. The propen&s;ity to imitation gave birth to this practice; and has &s;upported it wonderfully long, con&s;ider|ing how faint and in&s;ipid the imitation is. But the vulgar, great and &s;mall, devoid of ta&s;te, are entertained with the oddne&s;s and &s;ingularity of a re&s;emblance, however di|&s;tant, betwixt a tree and an animal. An at|tempt, in the gardens of Ver&s;ailles, to imi|tate
<PB N="310" REF="309">
a grove of trees by a group of <HI>jets d'eau,</HI> appears, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, not le&s;s ridi|culous.</P>
<P>In laying out a garden, every thing tri|vial or whim&s;ical ought to be avoided. Is a labyrinth then to be ju&s;tified? It is a mere conceit, like that of compo&s;ing ver&s;es in the &s;hape of an axe or an egg. The walks and hedges may be agreeable; but in the form of a labyrinth, they &s;erve to no end but to puzzle. A riddle is a con|ceit not &s;o mean; becau&s;e the &s;olution is a proof of &s;agacity, which affords no aid in tracing a labyrinth.</P>
<P>The gardens of Ver&s;ailles, executed with infinite expence by men at that time in high repute, are a la&s;ting monument of a ta&s;te the mo&s;t vicious and depraved. The faults above mentioned, in&s;tead of being a|voided, are cho&s;en as beauties, and multi|plied without end. Nature, it would &s;eem, was deemed too vulgar to be imitated in the works of a magnificent monarch; and for that rea&s;on preference was given to things unnatural, which probably were mi&s;taken for &s;upernatural. I have often a|mu&s;ed
<PB N="311" REF="310">
my&s;elf with a fanciful re&s;emblance betwixt the&s;e gardens and the Arabian tales. Each of them is a performance in|tended for the amu&s;ement of a great king: in the &s;ixteen gardens of Ver&s;ailles there is no unity of de&s;ign, more than in the thou|&s;and and one Arabian tales: and, la&s;tly, they are equally unnatural; groves of <HI>jets d'eau,</HI> &s;tatues of animals conver&s;ing in the manner of Ae&s;op, water i&s;&s;uing out of the mouths of wild bea&s;ts, give an impre&s;&s;ion of fairy-land and witchcraft, not le&s;s than diamond-palaces, invi&s;ible rings, &s;pells and incantations.</P>
<P>A &s;traight road is the mo&s;t agreeable, becau&s;e it &s;hortens the journey. But in an embelli&s;hed field, a &s;traight walk has an air of &s;tiffne&s;s and confinement: and at any rate is le&s;s agreeable than a winding or wa|ving walk; for in &s;urveying the beauties of a fine field, we love to roam from place to place at freedom. Winding walks have an|other advantage: at every &s;tep they open new views. In &s;hort, the walks in a field intended for entertainment, ought not to have any appearance of a road. My inten|tion
<PB N="312" REF="311">
is not to make a journey, but to fea&s;t my eye with the beauties of art and nature. This rule excludes not long &s;traight o|penings terminating upon di&s;tant objects. The&s;e, be&s;ide variety, never fail to rai&s;e an emotion of grandeur, by extending in ap|pearance the &s;ize of the field. An opening without a terminating object, &s;oon clo&s;es upon the eye: but an object, at whatever di&s;tance, continues the opening; and deludes the &s;pectator into a conviction, that the trees which confine the view are continued till they join the object. Straight walks al&s;o in rece&s;&s;es do extremely well: they vary the &s;cenery, and are favourable to medita|tion.</P>
<P>An avenue ought not to be directed in a &s;traight line upon a dwelling-hou&s;e: bet|ter far an oblique approach in a waving line, with &s;ingle trees and other &s;cattered objects interpo&s;ed. In a direct approach, the fir&s;t appearance continues the &s;ame to the end: we &s;ee a hou&s;e at a di&s;tance, and we &s;ee it all along in the &s;ame &s;pot without any variety. In an oblique approach, the intervening objects put the hou&s;e &s;eemingly
<PB N="313" REF="312">
in motion: it moves with the pa&s;&s;enger, and appears to direct its cour&s;e &s;o as ho&s;pi|tably to intercept him. An oblique ap|proach contributes al&s;o to variety: the hou&s;e being &s;een &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in different direc|tions, takes on at every &s;tep a new figure.</P>
<P>A garden on a flat ought to be highly and variou&s;ly ornamented, in order to occupy the mind and prevent its regretting the in&s;i|pidity of an uniform plain. Artificial mounts in this view are common: but no per&s;on has thought of an artificial walk ele|vated high above the plain. Such a walk is airy, and tends to elevate the mind: it extends and varies the pro&s;pect: and it makes the plain, &s;een from a height, ap|pear more agreeable.</P>
<P>Whether &s;hould a ruin be in the Gothic or Grecian form? In the former, I &s;ay; becau&s;e it exhibits the triumph of time over &s;trength, a melancholy but not unplea&s;ant thought. A Grecian ruin &s;ugge&s;ts rather the triumph of barbarity over ta&s;te, a gloo|my and di&s;couraging thought.</P>
<P>Fountains are &s;eldom in a good ta&s;te. Statues of animals vomiting water, which
<PB N="314" REF="313">
prevail every where, &s;tand condemned. A &s;tatue of a whale &s;pouting water upward from its head, would in one &s;en&s;e be natu|ral, as whales of a certain &s;pecies have that power. The de&s;ign however would &s;carce be reli&s;hed, becau&s;e its &s;ingularity would give it the appearance of being un|natural. There is another rea&s;on again&s;t it, that the figure of a whale is in it&s;elf not a|greeable. In the many fountains in and about Rome, &s;tatues of fi&s;hes are frequently employ'd to &s;upport a large ba&s;in of water. This unnatural conceit cannot be otherwi&s;e explained, than by the connection betwixt water and the fi&s;h that &s;wim in it; which by the way is a proof of the influence that even the &s;lighter connections have on the mind. The only good de&s;ign for a foun|tain I have met with, is what follows. In an artificial rock, rugged and abrupt, there is a cavity out of &s;ight at the top: the wa|ter, convey'd to it by a pipe, pours or trickles down the broken parts of the rock, and is collected into a ba&s;in at the foot: it is &s;o contrived, as to make the water fall in &s;heets or in rills at plea&s;ure.</P>

Hitherto a garden has been treated as a work intended &s;olely for plea&s;ure, or, in o|ther words, for giving impre&s;&s;ions of intrin|&s;ic beauty. What comes next in order is the beauty of a garden de&s;tined for u&s;e, termed <HI>relative beauty</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the&s;e terms defined, chap. 3.</NOTE>; and this branch &s;hall be di&s;patched in a few words. In gar|dening, luckily, relative beauty need never &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to intrin&s;ic beauty. All the ground that can be requi&s;ite for u&s;e, makes but a &s;mall proportion of an orna|mented field; and may be put in any corner without ob&s;tructing the di&s;po&s;ition of the capital parts. At the &s;ame time, a kitchen|garden or an orchard is &s;u&s;ceptible of intrin|&s;ic beauty; and may be &s;o artfully di&s;po&s;ed among the other parts, as by variety and contra&s;t to contribute to the beauty of the whole. In this re&s;pect, architecture is far more intricate, as will be &s;een immediately: for there, it being often requi&s;ite to blend intrin&s;ic and relative beauty in the &s;ame building, it becomes a difficult ta&s;k to at|tain both in any perfection.</P>

As gardening is brought to greater per|fection in China than in any other known country, an account of the means practi&s;ed by Chine&s;e arti&s;ts to in&s;pire all the various emotions of gardening, will be a fine illu|&s;tration of the foregoing doctrine. In gene|ral, it is an indi&s;pen&s;able law with them, never to deviate from nature: but in order to produce that degree of variety which is plea&s;ing, every method is u&s;ed that is con&s;i&s;tent with nature. Nature is &s;trictly imitated in the banks of their artificial lakes and rivers; which &s;ometimes are bare and gravelly, &s;ometimes covered with wood quite to the brink of the water. To flat &s;pots adorned with flowers and &s;hrubs, are oppo&s;ed others &s;teep and rocky. We &s;ee meadows covered with cattle; rice-grounds that run into the lakes; groves into which enter navigable creeks and rivulets. The&s;e generally conduct to &s;ome intere&s;ting object, a magnificent building, terraces cut in a mountain, a ca&s;cade, a grotto, an artificial rock, and other &s;uch inventions. Their ar|tificial rivers are generally &s;erpentine; &s;ome|times narrow, noi&s;y, and rapid; &s;ometimes
<PB N="317" REF="316">
deep, broad, and &s;low: and to make the &s;cene &s;till more active, mills and other mo|ving machines are often erected. In the lakes are inter&s;per&s;ed i&s;lands; &s;ome barren, &s;urrounded with rocks and &s;hoals; others inriched with every thing that art and na|ture can furni&s;h. Even in their ca&s;cades they avoid regularity, as forcing nature out of its cour&s;e: the waters are &s;een bur&s;ting out from among the caverns and windings of the artificial rocks; here an impetuous cataract, there many le&s;&s;er falls: and in its pa&s;&s;age, the water is often impeded by trees and heaps of &s;tones, that &s;eem brought down by the violence of the current. Straight lines, generally avoided, are &s;ome|times indulged, in order to take the advan|tage of any intere&s;ting object at a di&s;tance, by directing openings upon it.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of the influence of contra&s;t, the Chine&s;e arti&s;ts deal in &s;udden tran&s;itions, and in oppo&s;ing to each other, forms, co|lours, and &s;hades. The eye is conducted, from limited to exten&s;ive views, and from lakes and rivers to plains, hills, and woods: to dark and gloomy colours, are oppo&s;ed

In plantations, the trees are artfully mixed ac|cording to their &s;hape and colour; tho&s;e of &s;preading branches with the pyramidal, and the light with the deep green. They even introduce decay'd trees, &s;ome erect, and &s;ome half out of the ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ta&s;te has &s;ugge&s;ted to Kent the &s;ame artifice. The placing a decay'd tree properly, contributes to contra&s;t; and al&s;o produces a &s;ort of pity, grounded on an imaginary per&s;oni|fication.</NOTE>. In order to heighten contra&s;t, much bolder &s;trokes are ri&s;ked. They &s;ometimes introduce rough rocks, dark caverns, trees ill formed and &s;eemingly rent by tempe&s;ts, or bla&s;ted by lightning, a building in ruins or half con&s;umed by fire. But to relieve the mind from the har&s;hne&s;s of &s;uch objects, they are always &s;ucceeded by the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenes.</P>

<P>Nothing is more &s;tudied in Chine&s;e gar|dens than to rai&s;e wonder or &s;urpri&s;e. In &s;cenes calculated for that end, every thing appears like fairy-land; a torrent, for ex|ample, convey'd under ground, producing an uncommon &s;ound that puzzles a &s;tranger to gue&s;s what it may be; and, to increa&s;e our wonder by multiplying &s;uch uncommon &s;ounds, the rocks and buildings are contri|ved with cavities and inter&s;tices. Sometimes one is led in&s;en&s;ibly into dark caverns, termi|nating unexpectedly in a land&s;cape inriched with all that nature affords the mo&s;t deli|cious. At other times, beautiful walks in|&s;en&s;ibly conduct us to a rough uncultivated field, where bu&s;hes briers and &s;tones in|terrupt the pa&s;&s;age: when we look about for an outlet, &s;ome rich pro&s;pect unexpect|edly opens to view. Another artifice is, to ob&s;cure &s;ome capital part by trees or other interpo&s;ed objects: our curio&s;ity is rai&s;ed to know what lies beyond; and after a few

&s;teps, we are greatly &s;urpri&s;ed with &s;ome &s;cene totally different from what was ex|pected.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e the&s;e cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations up|on gardening, with a remark that mu&s;t touch every reader. Rough uncultivated ground, di&s;mal to the eye, in&s;pires peevi&s;h|ne&s;s and di&s;content. May not this be one cau&s;e of the har&s;h manners of &s;avages? In a field richly ornamented, are collected beautiful objects of various kinds. Such a field di&s;plays in full lu&s;tre, the goodne&s;s of the Deity and the ample provi&s;ion he has made for our happine&s;s; which mu&s;t fill every &s;pectator, with gratitude to his Maker and with benevolence to his fellow-creatures. Other fine arts may be perverted to excite irregular, and e|ven vicious, emotions: but gardening, which in&s;pires the pure&s;t and mo&s;t refined plea&s;ures, cannot but promote every good affection. The gaiety and harmony of mind it produceth, mu&s;t naturally incline the &s;pectator to communicate his &s;atisfac|tion to others by acts of humanity and kindne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="320">
Having fini&s;hed what occurred on gar|dening, I proceed to rules and ob&s;ervations that more peculiarly concern architecture. Architecture being an u&s;eful as well as a fine art, buildings and parts of buildings mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> what are intended for utility &s;olely, what for or|nament &s;olely, and what for both. A build|ing intended for utility &s;olely, &s;uch as de|tached offices, ought in every part to corre|&s;pond preci&s;ely to that intention. The lea&s;t deviation from u&s;e, though contributing to ornament, will be di&s;agreeable. For every work of u&s;e being con&s;idered as a means to an end, its perfection as a means is the ca|pital circum&s;tance; and every other beauty, in oppo&s;ition, is neglected as improper and impertinent. In things again intended for ornament, &s;uch as pillars, obeli&s;ks, tri|umphal arches, beauty &s;olely ought to be regarded. A Heathen temple mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as merely ornamental; for being dedicated to &s;ome deity, and not intended for habitation, it is &s;u&s;ceptible of any figure and any embelli&s;hment that fancy can &s;ug|ge&s;t and beauty require. The great diffi|culty
<PB N="322" REF="321">
of contrivance, re&s;pects buildings that are intended for plea&s;ure as well as for u&s;e. The&s;e ends, employing different and often oppo&s;ite means, are with difficulty reconci|led. In palaces, and other buildings &s;uffi|ciently exten&s;ive to admit a variety of u&s;eful contrivance, regularity ju&s;tly takes the lead. But in dwelling-hou&s;es that are too &s;mall for variety of contrivance, utility ought to prevail; neglecting regularity &s;o far as it &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to convenience.</P>
<P>Intrin&s;ic and relative beauty being found|ed on different principles, mu&s;t be handled &s;eparately; and I begin with relative beauty, as of the greater importance.</P>
<P>The proportions of a door, are determi|ned by the u&s;e to which it is de&s;tined. The door of a dwelling-hou&s;e, which ought to corre&s;pond to the human &s;ize, is confined to &s;even or eight feet in height, and three or four in breadth. The proportions pro|per for the door of a barn or coach-hou&s;e, are widely different. Another con&s;idera|tion enters. To &s;tudy intrin&s;ic beauty in a coach-hou&s;e or barn, intended merely for u&s;e, is obviou&s;ly improper. But a dwell|ing-hou&s;e
<PB N="323" REF="322">
may admit ornaments; and the principal door of a palace demands all the grandeur that is con&s;i&s;tent with the fore|going proportions dictated by utility. It ought to be elevated and approached by &s;teps; and it may be adorned with pillars &s;upporting an architrave, or in any other beautiful manner. The door of a church ought to be wide, in order to afford an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age for a multitude. The widene&s;s, at the &s;ame time, regulates the height, as will appear by and by. The &s;ize of windows ought to be proportioned to that of the room they &s;erve with light; for if the apperture be not &s;ufficiently large to con|vey light to every corner, the room is dark and gloomy. Steps of &s;tairs ought to be ac|commodated to the human figure, without regarding any other proportion: the&s;e &s;teps accordingly are the &s;ame in large and in &s;mall buildings, becau&s;e both are inhabited by men of the &s;ame &s;ize.</P>
<P>I proceed to con&s;ider intrin&s;ic beauty blended with that which is relative. A cube in it&s;elf is more agreeable than a parallelo|pipedon, which will con&s;tantly hold in &s;mall
<PB N="324" REF="323">
figures. But a large building in the form a cube, appears lumpi&s;h and heavy; while the other figure, &s;et on its &s;maller ba&s;e, is by its elevation more agreeable: and hence the beauty of a Gothic tower. But let us &s;uppo&s;e this parallelopipedon de&s;tin'd for a dwelling-hou&s;e, to make way for relative beauty. Here utility prevails over elevation; and a parallelopipedon, inconvenient by its height, is &s;et upon its larger ba&s;e. The loftine&s;s is gone; but that lo&s;s is more than compen&s;ated by additional convenience; and for that rea&s;on the form of a building &s;pread more upon the ground than rai&s;ed in height, is always preferred for a dwelling-hou&s;e, without excepting even the mo&s;t &s;umptuous palace.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the divi&s;ions within, utility requires that the rooms be rectangular; for otherwi&s;e void &s;paces will be left of no u&s;e. A hexagonal figure leaves no void &s;pa|ces; but then it determines the rooms to be all of one &s;ize, which is extremely incon|venient. A cube will at fir&s;t be pronoun|ced the mo&s;t agreeable figure; and this may hold in a room of a moderate &s;ize.
<PB N="325" REF="324">
But in a very large room, utility requires a different figure. The chief convenience of a great room, is unconfined motion. This directs us to the greate&s;t length that can be obtained. But a &s;quare room of a great &s;ize is inconvenient, by removing far from the hand, chairs and tables, which, when unemploy'd, mu&s;t be ranged along the &s;ides of the room. Utility therefore requires a large room to be a parallelogram. This figure, at the &s;ame time, is the be&s;t calcu|lated for receiving light; becau&s;e, to avoid cro&s;s-light, all the windows ought to be in one wall; and if the oppo&s;ite wall be at &s;uch di&s;tance as not to be fully lighted, the room mu&s;t be ob&s;cure. The height of a room exceeding nine or ten feet, has little or no relation to utility; and therefore pro|portion is the only rule for determining the height when above that number of feet.</P>
<P>As all arti&s;ts who deal in the beautiful are naturally prone to entertain the eye, they have great opportunity to exert their ta&s;te upon palaces and &s;umptuous buildings, where, as above ob&s;erved, intrin&s;ic beauty ought to have the a&s;cendant over that which
<PB N="326" REF="325">
is relative. But &s;uch propen&s;ity is unhappy with re&s;pect to private dwelling-hou&s;es; be|cau&s;e in the&s;e, relative beauty cannot be di&s;|play'd in any perfection, without abandon|ing intrin&s;ic beauty. There is no opportu|nity for great variety of form in a &s;mall hou&s;e; and in an edifice of this kind, inter|nal convenience has not hitherto been hap|pily adju&s;ted to external regularity. I am apt to believe, that an accurate coincidence here, is beyond the reach of art. And yet architects always &s;plit upon this rock; for they never will give over attempting to re|concile the&s;e two incompatibles. How el&s;e &s;hould it be accounted for, that of the end|le&s;s variety of private dwelling-hou&s;es, there is not one to be found, that is generally a|greed upon as a good pattern? The un|wearied propen&s;ity to make a hou&s;e regular as well as convenient, forces the architect, in &s;ome articles, to &s;acrifice convenience to regularity, and in others, regularity to con|venience. By this means, the hou&s;e, which turns out neither regular nor convenient, never fails to di&s;plea&s;e. The faults are ob|vious,
<PB N="327" REF="326">
and the difficulty of doing better is known to the arti&s;t only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hou&s;es are built to live in, and not to look on. There|fore let u&s;e be preferred before uniformity, except where both may be had." <BIBL>Lo. Verulam, e&s;&s;ay 45.</BIBL></Q> </P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more evident, than that the form of a dwelling-hou&s;e ought to be &s;uited to the climate; and yet no error is more common, than to copy in Britain the form of Italian hou&s;es; not forgetting even tho&s;e parts that are purpo&s;ely contrived for air, and for excluding the &s;un. I &s;hall give one or two in&s;tances. A colonnade along the front of a building, hath a fine effect in Greece and Italy, by producing coolne&s;s and ob&s;curity, agreeable properties in warm and luminous climates. The cold climate of Britain is altogether aver&s;e to this ornament. A colonnade therefore, can never be proper in this country, unle&s;s when employ'd to communicate with a detached building. A|gain, a logio opening the hou&s;e to the north, contrived in Italy for gathering cool air, is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more improper for this cli|mate. Scarce endurable in &s;ummer, it, in
<PB N="328" REF="327">
winter, expo&s;es the hou&s;e to the bitter bla&s;ts of the north, and to every &s;hower of &s;now and rain.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed what appeared nece&s;&s;a|ry to be &s;aid upon relative beauty, &s;ingly con&s;idered, or in combination with intrin&s;ic beauty, the next &s;tep is, to view architecture as one of the fine arts, and to examine tho&s;e buildings and parts of buildings that are &s;olely calculated to plea&s;e the eye. In the works of nature, grand and magnificent, variety prevails. The timid hand of art, is guided by rule and compa&s;s. Hence it is, that in works which imitate nature, the great art is to hide every appearance of art; which is done by avoiding regularity and indulging variety. But in works of art that are ori|ginal and not imitative, &s;uch as architecture, &s;trict regularity and uniformity ought to be &s;tudied &s;o far as con&s;i&s;tent with utility.</P>
<P>In buildings intended to plea&s;e the eye, proportion is not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential than regulari|ty and uniformity; for we are &s;o framed by nature, as to be plea&s;ed equally with each of the&s;e. By many writers it is taken for granted, that in all the parts of a building
<PB N="329" REF="328">
there are certain &s;trict proportions which plea&s;e the eye; preci&s;ely as there are certain &s;trict proportions of &s;ound which plea&s;e the ear; and that in both the &s;lighte&s;t deviation is equally di&s;agreeable. Others again &s;eem to reli&s;h more a compari&s;on betwixt propor|tion in numbers and proportion in quantity; and hold that the &s;ame proportions are a|greeable in both. The proportions, for ex|ample, of the numbers 16, 24, and 36 are agreeable; and &s;o, &s;ay they, are the pro|portions of a room, the height of which is 16 feet, the breadth 24, and the length 36. This point, with relation to the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject, being of importance, the reader will examine it with attention and impartiality. To refute the notion of a re&s;emblance be|twixt mu&s;ical proportions and tho&s;e of ar|chitecture, it might be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve in general, that the one is addre&s;&s;ed to the ear, the other to the eye; and that objects of different &s;en&s;es have no re&s;emblance, nor indeed any relation to each other. But more particularly, what plea&s;es the ear in harmony, is not the proportion of the &s;trings of the in&s;trument, but of the &s;ounds that
<PB N="330" REF="329">
the&s;e &s;trings produce. In architecture, on the contrary, it is the proportion of different quantities that plea&s;es the eye, without the lea&s;t relation to &s;ound. Be&s;ide, were quan|tity here to be the &s;ole ground of compari|&s;on, we have no rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, that there is any natural analogy betwixt the proportions that plea&s;e in a building and the proportions of &s;trings that produce concor|dant &s;ounds. I in&s;tance in particular an oc|tave, the mo&s;t complete of all concords. An octave is produced by two &s;trings of the &s;ame ten&s;ion and diameter, and as to length in the proportion of one to two. I do not know, that this proportion will be agreeable in any two parts of a building. I add, that concordant notes are produced by wind in|&s;truments, which, as to proportion, appear not to have even the &s;lighte&s;t re&s;emblance to a building.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the other notion in&s;titu|ting a compari&s;on betwixt proportion in numbers and proportion in quantity, I urge, that number and quantity are &s;o di&s;tinct from each other, as to afford no probability of any natural relation betwixt them. Quan|tity
<PB N="331" REF="330">
is a real quality of every &s;ub&s;tance or body: number is not a real quality, but merely a conception that ari&s;es upon view|ing a plurality of things in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Be|cau&s;e an arithmetical proportion is agreeable in numbers, have we any rea&s;on to conclude that it mu&s;t al&s;o be agreeable in quantity? At this rate, a geometrical proportion and many others, ought al&s;o to be agreeable in both. A certain proportion may coincide in both; and among an endle&s;s variety of proportions, it would be wonderful, if there never &s;hould be a coincidence. One ex|ample is given of this coincidence, in the numbers 16, 24, and 36; but to be con|vinced that it is merely accidental, we need but reflect, that the &s;ame proportions are not applicable to the external figure of a hou&s;e, and far le&s;s to a column.</P>
<P>That we are framed by nature to reli&s;h proportion as well as regularity, is indi&s;pu|table: but that agreeable proportion, like concord in &s;ounds, is confined to certain preci&s;e mea&s;ures, is not warranted by expe|rience: on the contrary, we learn from experience, that various proportions are e|qually
<PB N="332" REF="331">
agreeable, that proportion is never tied down to preci&s;e mea&s;ures but admits more and le&s;s, and that we are not &s;en&s;ible of di&s;proportion till the difference betwixt the quantities compared become the mo&s;t &s;triking circum&s;tance. Columns evidently admit different proportions, equally agree|able. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame in hou&s;es, rooms, and other parts of a building. And this opens an intere&s;ting reflection. The fore|going difference betwixt concord and pro|portion, is an additional in&s;tance of that ad|mirable harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among the &s;everal branches of the human frame. The ear is an accurate judge of &s;ounds and of their &s;malle&s;t differences; and that concord in &s;ounds &s;hould be regulated by accurate mea&s;ures, is perfectly well &s;uited to this ac|curacy of perception. The eye is more un|certain about the &s;ize of a large object, than of one that is &s;mall; and in different &s;itua|tions the &s;ame object appears of different &s;i|zes. Delicacy of feeling therefore with re|&s;pect to proportion in quantities, would be an u&s;ele&s;s quality. It is much better order|ed, that there &s;hould be &s;uch a latitude with
<PB N="333" REF="332">
re&s;pect to agreeable proportions, as to cor|re&s;pond to the uncertainty of the eye with re&s;pect to quantity.</P>
<P>But this &s;cene is too intere&s;ting to be pa&s;&s;ed over in a cur&s;ory view: all its beauties are not yet di&s;play'd. I proceed to ob&s;erve, that to make the eye as delicate with re|&s;pect to proportion as the ear is with re&s;pect to concord, would not only be an u&s;ele&s;s quality, but be the &s;ource of continual pain and unea&s;ine&s;s. I need go no farther for a proof than the very room I po&s;&s;e&s;s at pre|&s;ent: every &s;tep I take, varies to me, in appearance, the proportion of the length and breadth. At that rate, I &s;hould not be happy but in one preci&s;e &s;pot, where the proportion appears agreeable. Let me fur|ther ob&s;erve, that it would be &s;ingular in|deed, to find in the nature of man, any two principles in perpetual oppo&s;ition to each other. This would preci&s;ely be the ca&s;e, if proportion were circum&s;cribed like concord; for it would exclude all but one of tho&s;e proportions that utility requires in different buildings, and in different parts of the &s;ame building.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="333">
It is ludicrous to ob&s;erve all writers ac|knowledging the nece&s;&s;ity of accurate pro|portions, and yet differing widely about them. Laying afide rea&s;oning and philo&s;o|phy, one fact univer&s;ally agreed on ought to have undeceived them, that the &s;ame proportions which plea&s;e in a model are not agreeable in a large building. A room 48 feet in length and 24 in breadth and height, is well proportioned; but a room 12 feet wide and high and 24 long, looks like a gallery.</P>
<P>Perrault, in his compari&s;on of the ancients and moderns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 94.</NOTE>, is the only author who runs to the oppo&s;ite extreme; maintaining, that the different proportions a&s;&s;igned to each order of columns are arbitrary, and that the beauty of the&s;e proportions is en|tirely the effect of cu&s;tom. This bewrays ignorance of human nature, which evident|ly delights in proportion, as well as in regu|larity, order, and propriety. But without any acquaintance with human nature, a &s;ingle reflection might have convinced him
<PB N="335" REF="334">
of his error; that if the&s;e proportions had not originally been agreeable, they could not have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by cu&s;tom. If a thing be univer&s;al, it mu&s;t be natural.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate the pre&s;ent point, I &s;hall add a few examples of the agreeablene&s;s of dif|ferent proportions. In a &s;umptuous edifice, the capital rooms ought to be large, for o|therwi&s;e they will not be proportioned to the &s;ize of the building. On the other hand, a very large room in a &s;mall hou&s;e, is di&s;|proportioned. But in things thus related, the mind requires not a preci&s;e or &s;ingle pro|portion, rejecting all others; on the contra|ry, many different proportions are made e|qually welcome. It is only when a propor|tion becomes loo&s;e and di&s;tant, that the a|greeablene&s;s abates, and at la&s;t vani&s;heth. In all buildings accordingly, we find rooms of different proportions equally agreeable, even where the proportion is not influenced by utility. With re&s;pect to the height of a room, the proportion it ought to bear to the length and breadth, is extremely arbitrary; and it cannot be otherwi&s;e, con&s;idering the uncertainty of the eye as to the height of a
<PB N="336" REF="335">
room, when it exceeds 17 or 18 feet. In columns again, even architects mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that the proportion of height and thick|ne&s;s varies betwixt 8 diameters and 10, and that every proportion betwixt the&s;e two ex|tremes is agreeable. But this is not all. There mu&s;t certainly be a further variation of proportion, depending on the &s;ize of the column. A row of columns 10 feet high, and a row twice that height, require differ|ent proportions. The intercolumniations mu&s;t al&s;o differ in proportion according to the height of the row.</P>
<P>Proportion of parts is not only it&s;elf a beauty, but is in&s;eparably connected with a beauty of the fir&s;t magnitude. Parts that in conjunction appear proportional, never fail &s;eparately to produce &s;imilar emotions; which exi&s;ting together, are extremely plea|&s;ant, as I have had occa&s;ion to &s;how<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 4.</NOTE>. Thus a room of which the parts are all fine|ly adju&s;ted to each other, &s;trikes us with the beauty of proportion. It produceth at the &s;ame time a plea&s;ure far &s;uperior. The
<PB N="337" REF="336">
length, the breadth, the height, the win|dows, rai&s;e each of them &s;eparately an emo|tion. The&s;e emotions are &s;imilar; and though faint when felt &s;eparately, they pro|duce in conjunction the emotion of concord or harmony, which is extremely plea&s;ant. On the other hand, where the length of a room far exceeds the breadth, the mind comparing together parts &s;o intimately con|nected, immediately perceives a di&s;agree|ment or di&s;proportion which di&s;gu&s;ts. But this is not all. Viewing them &s;eparately, different emotions are produced, that of grandeur from the great length, and that of meanne&s;s or littlene&s;s from the &s;mall breadth, which in union are di&s;agreeable by their di&s;cordance. Hence it is, that a long gallery, however convenient for exer|ci&s;e, is not an agreeable figure of a room. We con&s;ider it, like a &s;table, as de&s;tined for u&s;e, and expect not that in any other re&s;pect it &s;hould be agreeable.</P>
<P>Regularity and proportion are e&s;&s;ential in buildings de&s;tined chiefly or &s;olely to plea&s;e the eye, becau&s;e they are the means to pro|duce intrin&s;ic beauty. But a &s;kilful arti&s;t
<PB N="338" REF="337">
will not confine his view to regularity and proportion. He will al&s;o &s;tudy propriety, which is perceived when the form and or|naments of a &s;tructure are &s;uited to the pur|po&s;e for which it is appointed. The &s;en&s;e of propriety dictates the following rule, That every building ought to have an expre&s;&s;ion corre&s;ponding to its de&s;tination. A palace ought to be &s;umptuous and grand; a pri|vate dwelling, neat and mode&s;t; a play|hou&s;e, gay and &s;plendid; and a monument, gloomy and melancholy. A Heathen tem|ple has a double de&s;tination: it is con&s;idered chiefly as a hou&s;e dedicated to &s;ome divini|ty; and in that re&s;pect it ought to be grand, elevated, and magnificent: it is con&s;idered al&s;o as a place of wor&s;hip; and in that re&s;pect it ought to be &s;omewhat dark or gloomy; becau&s;e dimne&s;s produces that tone of mind which is &s;uited to humility and devotion. A Chri&s;tian church is not con&s;idered as a hou&s;e for the Deity, but merely a place of wor&s;hip: it ought therefore to be decent and plain, without much ornament: a &s;i|tuation ought to be cho&s;en, humble and retired; becau&s;e the congregation, during
<PB N="339" REF="338">
wor&s;hip, ought to be humble and di&s;enga|ged from the world. Columns, be&s;ide their chief de&s;tination of being &s;upports, contribute to that peculiar expre&s;&s;ion which the de&s;tination of a building requires: co|lumns of different proportions, &s;erve to ex|pre&s;s loftine&s;s, lightne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as well as &s;trength. Situation al&s;o may contribute to expre&s;&s;ion: conveniency regulates the &s;itu|ation of a private dwelling-hou&s;e; but, as I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 10.</NOTE>, the &s;ituation of a palace ought to be lofty.</P>
<P>And this leads me to examine, whether the &s;ituation of a great hou&s;e, where the arti&s;t is limited in his choice, ought in any mea&s;ure to regulate its form. The con|nection betwixt a great hou&s;e and the neigh|bouring grounds, though not extremely in|timate, demands however &s;ome congruity. It would, for in&s;tance, di&s;plea&s;e us to find an elegant building thrown away upon a wild uncultivated country: congruity requires a poli&s;hed field for &s;uch a building; and be|&s;ide the plea&s;ure of congruity, the &s;pectator
<PB N="340" REF="339">
is &s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ure of concordance from the &s;imilarity of the emotions produ|ced by the two objects. The old Gothic form of building &s;eems well &s;uited to the rough uncultivated regions where it was in|vented. The only mi&s;take was, the tran&s;|ferring this form to the fine plains of France and Italy, better fitted for buildings in the Grecian ta&s;te. But by refining upon the Gothic form, every thing in the power of invention has been done, to reconcile it to its new &s;ituation. The profu&s;e variety of wild and grand objects about Inverary, de|manded a hou&s;e in the Gothic form; and every one mu&s;t approve the ta&s;te of the pro|prietor, in adju&s;ting &s;o finely, as he has done, the appearance of his hou&s;e to that of the country where it is placed.</P>
<P>The external &s;tructure of a great hou&s;e, leads naturally to its internal &s;tructure. A large and &s;pacious room, receives us com|monly upon our entrance. This &s;eems to me a bad contrivance in &s;everal re&s;pects. In the fir&s;t place, when immediately from the open air we &s;tep into &s;uch a room, its &s;ize in appearance is dimini&s;hed by contra&s;t: it
<PB N="341" REF="340">
looks little compared with the great canopy the &s;ky. In the next place, when it reco|vers its grandeur, as it &s;oon doth, it gives a diminutive appearance to the re&s;t of the hou&s;e: pa&s;&s;ing from it, every apartment looks little. This room therefore may be aptly compared to the &s;woln commencement of an epic poem.
<Q>Bella per Emathios plu&s;quam civilia campos.</Q>
In the third place, by its &s;ituation it &s;erves only for a waiting-room, and a pa&s;|&s;age to the principal apartments. And yet undoubtedly, the room of the great|e&s;t &s;ize ought to be re&s;erved for com|pany. A great room, which enlarges the mind and gives a certain elevation to the &s;pirits, is de&s;tined by nature for conver&s;a|tion. Rejecting therefore this form, I take a hint from the climax in writing for ano|ther form that appears more &s;uitable. My plan is, fir&s;t a hand&s;ome portico, propor|tioned to the &s;ize and fa&s;hion of the front: this portico leads into a waiting-room of a larger &s;ize; and this again to the great
<PB N="342" REF="341">
room, all by a progre&s;&s;ion from &s;mall to great. If the hou&s;e be very large, there may be &s;pace for the following &s;uit of rooms; fir&s;t, a portico; &s;econd, a pa&s;&s;age within the hou&s;e bounded by rows of co|lumns on each &s;ide connected by arcades; third, an octagon room, or of any other fi|gure, about the centre of the building; and, la&s;tly, the great room.</P>
<P>Of all the emotions that can be rai&s;ed by architecture, grandeur is that which has the greate&s;t influence on the mind. It ought therefore to be the chief &s;tudy of the arti&s;t, to rai&s;e this emotion in great build|ings. But it &s;eems unhappy for architecture, that it is nece&s;&s;arily governed by certain prin|ciples oppo&s;ite to grandeur: the direct ef|fect of regularity and proportion, is to make a building appear le&s;s than it is in rea|lity. Any invention to reconcile the&s;e with grandeur, would be a capital improvement in architecture.</P>
<P>Next of ornaments, which contribute greatly to give buildings a peculiar expre&s;|&s;ion. It has been a doubt with me, whe|ther a building can regularly admit any or|nament
<PB N="343" REF="342">
but what is u&s;eful, or at lea&s;t appears to be u&s;eful. But con&s;idering the double aim of architecture, a fine as well as an u&s;eful art, there is no good rea&s;on why or|naments may not be added to plea&s;e the eye without any relation to u&s;e. This li|berty is allowed in poetry, painting, and gardening, and why not in architecture con|&s;idered as a fine art? A private dwelling|hou&s;e, it is true, and other edifices where u&s;e is the chief aim, admit not regularly any ornament but what has the appearance, at lea&s;t, of u&s;e: but temples, triumphal arches, and other buildings intended chiefly or &s;olely for &s;how, may be highly orna|mented.</P>
<P>This &s;ugge&s;ts a divi&s;ion of ornaments in|to three kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> ornaments that are beautiful without relation to u&s;e, &s;uch as &s;tatues in niches, va&s;es, ba&s;&s;o or alto relievo: next, things in them&s;elves not beautiful, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the beauty of utility by impo|&s;ing on the &s;pectator, and appearing to be of u&s;e, blind windows for example: the third kind is, where the thing is in it&s;elf beautiful, and al&s;o takes on the appearance
<PB N="344" REF="343">
of u&s;e; the ca&s;e of a pila&s;ter. With re|&s;pect to the &s;econd, it is an egregious blun|der, to contrive the ornament &s;o as to make it appear u&s;ele&s;s. If a blind window there|fore be nece&s;&s;ary for regularity, it ought to be &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the real windows. If it appear to be a blind window, it is di&s;gu&s;tful, as a vain at|tempt to &s;upply the want of invention. It &s;hows the irregularity in a &s;tronger light; by &s;ignifying that a window ought to be there in point of regularity, but that the ar|chitect had not &s;kill &s;ufficient to connect external regularity with internal conve|nience.</P>
<P>From ornaments in general, we de&s;cend to a pillar, the chief ornament in great buildings. The de&s;tination of a pillar is to &s;upport, really or in appearance, another part termed <HI>the architrave.</HI> With re&s;pect to the form of this ornament, I ob&s;erve, that a circle is a more agreeable figure than a &s;quare, a globe than a cube, and a cylin|der than a parallelopipedon. This la&s;t, in the language of architecture, is &s;aying, that a column is a more agreeable figure than a
<PB N="345" REF="344">
pila&s;ter. For that rea&s;on, it ought to be preferred, all other circum&s;tances being e|qual. Another rea&s;on concurs, that a co|lumn annexed to a wall, which is a plain &s;urface, makes a greater variety than a pi|la&s;ter. There is an additional rea&s;on for re|jecting pila&s;ters in the external front of a building, ari&s;ing from a principle unfolded above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 8.</NOTE>, <HI>viz.</HI> a remarkable tendency in the mind of man, to advance every thing to its perfection as well as to its final i&s;&s;ue. If I &s;ee a thing ob&s;curely in a dim light, and by disjointed parts, my curio&s;ity is rou&s;ed, and prompts me, out of the disjointed parts to compo&s;e an entire whole. I &s;uppo&s;e it to be, for example, a hor&s;e. My eye-&s;ight being obedient to this conjecture, I imme|diately perceive a hor&s;e, almo&s;t as di&s;tinctly as in day-light. This principle is applica|ble to the ca&s;e in hand. The mo&s;t &s;uperb front, at a great di&s;tance, appears a plain &s;urface: approaching gradually, we be|gin to perceive inequalities: the&s;e inequa|lities, advancing a few &s;teps more, take
<PB N="346" REF="345">
on the appearance of pillars; but whether round or &s;quare, we are uncertain: our curio&s;ity anticipating our progre&s;s, cannot re&s;t in &s;u&s;pen&s;e: we naturally &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t complete pillar, or that which is the mo&s;t agreeable to the eye; and we imme|diately perceive, or &s;eem to perceive, a number of columns: if upon a near ap|proach we find pila&s;ters only, the di&s;ap|pointment makes the&s;e pila&s;ters appear di&s;a|greeable; when ab&s;tracted from that cir|cum&s;tance, they would only have appeared &s;omewhat le&s;s agreeable. But as this de|ception cannot happen in the inner front inclo&s;ing a court, I &s;ee no rea&s;on for exclu|ding pila&s;ters there, when there is any rea|&s;on for preferring them before columns.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect now to the parts of a co|lumn, a bare uniform cylinder without ba&s;e or capital, appears naked and &s;carce agree|able: it ought therefore to have &s;ome fi|ni&s;hing at the top and at the bottom. Hence the three chief parts of a column, the &s;haft, the ba&s;e, and the capital. Nature undoubtedly requires a certain proportion a|mong the&s;e parts, but not limited within
<PB N="347" REF="346">
preci&s;e bounds. I &s;u&s;pect that the propor|tions in u&s;e have been influenced in &s;ome degree by the human figure; the capital be|ing conceived as the head, the ba&s;e as the feet. With re&s;pect to the ba&s;e indeed, the principle of utility interpo&s;es to vary it from the human figure: the ba&s;e mu&s;t be &s;o proportioned to the whole, as to give the column the appearance of &s;tability.</P>
<P>In architecture as well as in gardening, contradictory expre&s;&s;ions ought to be avoid|ed. Firmne&s;s and &s;olidity are the proper expre&s;&s;ions of a pede&s;tal: carved work, on the contrary, ought to be light and deli|cate. A pede&s;tal therefore, whether of a column or of a &s;tatue, ought to be &s;paringly ornamented: the ancients never ventured any bolder ornament than the ba&s;&s;o-relievo.</P>
<P>To &s;ucceed in allegorical or emblematic ornaments, is no &s;light effort of genius; for it is extremely difficult to di&s;po&s;e them &s;o in a building as to produce any good effect. The mixing them with realities, makes a mi|&s;erable jumble of truth and fiction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 20. &s;ect. 5.</NOTE>. In a
<PB N="348" REF="347">
ba&s;&s;o-relievo on Antonin's pillar, rain ob|tained by the prayers of a Chri&s;tian legion, is expre&s;&s;ed by joining to the group of &s;ol|diers a rainy Jupiter, with water in abun|dance running from his head and beard. De Piles, fond of the conceit, carefully in|forms his reader, that he mu&s;t not take this for a real Jupiter, but for a &s;ymbol which among the Pagans &s;ignified rain: an emblem ought not to make a part of the group repre&s;enting real objects or real e|vents, but be detached from it, &s;o as even at fir&s;t view to appear an emblem. But this is not all, nor the chief point. Every emblem ought to be rejected that is not clearly expre&s;&s;ive of its meaning: if it be in any degree ob&s;cure, it never can be re|li&s;hed. The temples of Ancient and Modern Virtue in the gardens of Stow, appear not at fir&s;t view emblematical; and when we are informed that they are &s;o, it is not ea&s;y to gather their meaning. The &s;pectator &s;ees one temple in full repair, another in ruins: but without an explanatory in&s;crip|tion, he may gue&s;s, but cannot be certain, that the former being dedicated to Ancient
<PB N="349" REF="348">
Virtue, the latter to Modern Virtue, are in|tended a &s;atire upon the pre&s;ent times. On the other hand, a trite emblem, like a trite &s;imile, is di&s;gu&s;tful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 8.</NOTE>. Nor ought an emblem more than a &s;imile to be founded on low or familiar objects; for if the objects be not agreeable, as well as their meaning, the emblem upon the whole will not be re|li&s;hed. A room in a dwelling-hou&s;e con|taining a monument to a decea&s;ed friend, is dedicated to Melancholy. Its furniture is a clock that &s;trikes every minute to &s;ig|nify how &s;wiftly time pa&s;&s;es: upon the mo|nument, weeping figures and other hack|ney'd ornaments commonly found upon tomb-&s;tones, with a &s;tuff'd raven in a corner: ver&s;es on death, and other &s;erious &s;ubjects, in&s;cribed all around. The objects are too familiar, and the artifice too appa|rent, to produce the intended effect.</P>
<P>The &s;tatue of Mo&s;es &s;triking a rock from which water actually i&s;&s;ues, is al&s;o in a fal&s;e ta&s;te; for it is mixing reality with re|pre&s;entation: Mo&s;es him&s;elf may bring
<PB N="350" REF="349">
water out of the rock, but this miracle is too much for his &s;tatue. The &s;ame objec|tion lies again&s;t a ca&s;cade where we &s;ee the &s;tatue of a water-god pouring out of his urn real water.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved above of gardening, that it contributes to rectitude of manners, by in|&s;piring gaiety and benevolence. I add an|other ob&s;ervation, That both gardening and architecture contribute to the &s;ame end, by in&s;piring neatne&s;s and elegance. It is ob&s;erved in Scotland, that even a turnpike|road has &s;ome influence of this kind upon the low people in the neighbourhood. They acquire a ta&s;te for regularity and neat|ne&s;s; which is di&s;play'd fir&s;t upon their yards and little inclo&s;ures, and next within doors. A ta&s;te for regularity and neatne&s;s thus gathering &s;trength, comes in&s;en&s;ibly to be extended to dre&s;s, and even to behaviour and manners.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. Standard of Ta&s;te.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THAT there is no di&s;puting about ta&s;te",</Q> meaning ta&s;te in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, is a &s;aying &s;o ge|nerally received as to have become a proverb. One thing indeed is evident, that if the pro|verb hold true with re&s;pect to any one ex|ternal &s;en&s;e, it mu&s;t hold true with re&s;pect to all. If the plea&s;ures of the palate di&s;dain a comparative trial and reject all critici&s;m, the plea&s;ures of touch, of &s;mell, of &s;ound, and even of &s;ight, mu&s;t be equally privile|ged. At this rate, a man is not within the reach of cen&s;ure, even where, in&s;en&s;ible to beauty, grandeur, or elegance, he prefers the Saracen's head upon a &s;ign-po&s;t before the be&s;t tablature of Raphael, or a rude Go|thic tower before the fine&s;t Grecian build|ing: nor where he prefers the &s;mell of a
<PB N="352" REF="351">
rotten carca&s;s before that of the mo&s;t odori|ferous flower: nor jarring di&s;cords before the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite harmony.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not &s;top here. If the plea|&s;ures of external &s;en&s;e be exempted from critici&s;m, why not every one of our plea|&s;ures, from whatever &s;ource derived? If ta&s;te in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word cannot be di&s;puted, there is as little room for di&s;|puting it in its figurative &s;en&s;e. The pro|verb accordingly comprehends both; and in that large &s;en&s;e may be re&s;olved into the following general propo&s;ition, That with re|&s;pect to the &s;en&s;itive part of our nature, by which &s;ome objects are agreeable &s;ome di&s;|agreeable, there is not &s;uch a thing as a <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad,</HI> a <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong;</HI> that every man's ta&s;te is to him&s;elf an ultimate &s;tandard with|out appeal; and con&s;equently that there is no ground of cen&s;ure again&s;t any one, if &s;uch a one there be, who prefers Black|more before Homer, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s before be|nevolence, or cowardice before magnanimi|ty.</P>
<P>The proverb in the foregoing in&s;tances, is indeed carried very far. It &s;eems difficult,
<PB N="353" REF="352">
however, to &s;ap its foundation, or with &s;uc|ce&s;s to attack it from any quarter. For in comparing the various ta&s;tes of individuals, it is not obvious what &s;tandard mu&s;t be ap|pealed to. Is not every man equally a judge of what is agreeable or di&s;agreeable to him&s;elf? Doth it not &s;eem odd, and per|haps ab&s;urd, that a man <HI>ought not</HI> to be plea&s;ed when he is, or that he <HI>ought</HI> to be plea&s;ed when he is not?</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning may perplex, but, in con|tradiction to &s;en&s;e and feeling, will never afford conviction. A man of ta&s;te mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily feel the rea&s;oning to be fal&s;e, how|ever unqualified to detect the fallacy. At the &s;ame time, though no man of ta&s;te will &s;ub&s;cribe to the proverb as holding true in e|very ca&s;e, no man will venture to affirm that it holds true in no ca&s;e. Subjects there are undoubtedly, that we may like or di&s;|like indifferently, without any imputation upon our ta&s;te. Were a philo&s;opher to make a &s;cale for human plea&s;ures with ma|ny divi&s;ions, in order that the value of each plea&s;ure may be denoted by the place it oc|cupies, he would not think of making di|vi&s;ions

without end, but would rank toge|ther many plea&s;ures ari&s;ing perhaps from dif|ferent objects, either as being equally va|luable, or differing &s;o imperceptibly as to make a &s;eparation unnece&s;&s;ary. Nature hath taken this cour&s;e, &s;o far as appears to the generality of mankind. There may be &s;ubdivi&s;ions without end; but we are only &s;en&s;ible of the gro&s;&s;er divi&s;ions, comprehend|ing each of them many plea&s;ures of various kinds. To the&s;e the proverb is applicable in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e; for with re&s;pect to plea&s;ures of the &s;ame rank, what ground can there be for preferring one before ano|ther? If a preference in fact be given by any individual, it cannot be ta&s;te, but cu|&s;tom, imitation, or &s;ome peculiarity of mind.</P>
<P>Nature in her &s;cale of plea&s;ures, has been &s;paring of divi&s;ions: &s;he hath wi&s;ely and benevolently filled every divi&s;ion with many plea&s;ures; in order that individuals may be contented with their own lot, without en|vying the happine&s;s of others: many hands mu&s;t be employ'd to procure us the conve|niencies of life; and it is nece&s;&s;ary that the
<PB N="355" REF="356">
different branches of bu&s;ine&s;s, whether more or le&s;s agreeable, be filled with hands. A ta&s;te too nice and delicate, would ob&s;truct this plan; for it would crowd &s;ome employ|ments, leaving others, not le&s;s u&s;eful, to|tally neglected. In our pre&s;ent condition, happy it is, that the plurality are not deli|cate in their choice. They fall in readily with the occupations, plea&s;ures, food, and company, that fortune throws in their way; and if at fir&s;t there be any di&s;plea&s;ing cir|cum&s;tance, cu&s;tom &s;oon makes it ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The proverb will be admitted &s;o far as it regards the particulars now explained. But when apply'd in general to every &s;ubject of ta&s;te, the difficulties to be encountered are in&s;uperable. What &s;hall we &s;ay, in parti|cular, as to the difficulty that ari&s;es from human nature it&s;elf? Do we not talk of a good and a bad ta&s;te? of a right and a wrong ta&s;te? and upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, do we not, with great confidence, cen&s;ure writers, painters, architects, and every one who deals in the fine arts? Are &s;uch critici&s;ms ab&s;urd and void of foundation? Have the foregoing expre&s;&s;ions, familiar in all lan|guages
<PB N="356" REF="357">
and among all people, no &s;ort of meaning? This can hardly be: what is univer&s;al mu&s;t have a foundation in nature. If we can reach this foundation, the &s;tand|ard of ta&s;te will no longer be a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>All living creatures are by nature di&s;tri|buted into cla&s;&s;es; the individuals of each, however diver&s;ified by &s;lighter differences, having a wonderful uniformity in their ca|pital parts internal and external. Each cla&s;s is di&s;tingui&s;hable from others by an exter|nal form; and not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hable by an internal con&s;titution, manife&s;ted by cer|tain powers, feelings, de&s;ires, and actions, peculiar to the individuals of each cla&s;s. Thus each cla&s;s may be conceived to have a common nature, which, in framing the individuals belonging to the cla&s;s, is taken for a model or &s;tandard.</P>
<P>Independent altogether of experience, men have a &s;en&s;e or conviction of a com|mon nature or &s;tandard, not only in their own &s;pecies, but in every &s;pecies of animals. And hence it is a matter of wonder, to find any individual deviating from the common nature of the &s;pecies, whether in its inter|nal
<PB N="357" REF="358">
or external con&s;truction: a child born with an aver&s;ion to its mother's milk, is a matter of wonder, not le&s;s than if born with|out a mouth, or with more than one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See E&s;&s;ays on morality and natural religion, part 1. e&s;|&s;ay 2. ch. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to this common nature or &s;tandard, we are &s;o con&s;tituted as to con|ceive it to be <HI>perfect</HI> or <HI>right;</HI> and con&s;e|quently that individuals <HI>ought</HI> to be made conformable to it. Every remarkable de|viation accordingly from the &s;tandard, makes an impre&s;&s;ion upon us of imperfection, irre|gularity, or di&s;order: it is di&s;agreeable and rai&s;es in us a painful emotion: mon&s;trous births, exciting the curio&s;ity of a philo&s;o|pher, fail not at the &s;ame time to excite a|ver&s;ion in a high degree.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we have a conviction, that the common nature of man is invariable not le&s;s than univer&s;al: we conceive that it hath no relation to time nor to place; but that it will be the &s;ame hereafter as at pre|&s;ent, and as it was in time pa&s;t; the &s;ame among all nations and in all corners of the
<PB N="358" REF="359">
earth. Nor are we deceived: giving al|lowance for the difference of culture and gradual refinement of manners, the fact corre&s;ponds to our conviction.</P>
<P>This conviction of a common nature or &s;tandard, and of its perfection, is the foun|dation of morality; and accounts clearly for that remarkable conception we have, of a right and a wrong ta&s;te in morals. It ac|counts not le&s;s clearly for the conception we have of a right and a wrong ta&s;te in the fine arts. A per&s;on who rejects objects gene|rally agreeable, and delights in objects ge|nerally di&s;agreeable, is condemned as a mon|&s;ter: we di&s;approve his ta&s;te as bad or wrong; and we have a clear conception that he deviates from the common &s;tand|ard. If man were &s;o framed as not to have any notion of a common &s;tandard, the pro|verb mentioned in the beginning would hold univer&s;ally, not only in the fine arts but in morals: upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, the ta&s;te of every man, with re&s;pect to both, would to him&s;elf be an ultimate &s;tandard. But the conviction of a common &s;tandard being made a part of our nature, we intuitively conceive a ta&s;te to be right or good if con|formable
<PB N="359" REF="360">
to the common &s;tandard, and wrong or bad if di&s;conformable.</P>
<P>No particular concerning human nature is more univer&s;al, than the unea&s;ine&s;s a man feels when in matters of importance his o|pinions are rejected by others. Why &s;hould difference in opinion create unea&s;ine&s;s, more than difference in &s;tature, in countenance, or in dre&s;s? The &s;en&s;e of a common &s;tandard is the only principle that can ex|plain this my&s;tery. Every man, generally &s;peaking, taking it for granted that his opi|nions agree with the common &s;en&s;e of man|kind, is therefore di&s;gu&s;ted with tho&s;e of a contrary opinion, not as differing from him, but as differing from the common &s;tandard. Hence in all di&s;putes, we find the parties, each of them equally, appealing con&s;tantly to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind as the ul|timate rule or &s;tandard. Were it not for this &s;tandard, of which the conviction is u|niver&s;al, I'cannot di&s;cover the &s;lighte&s;t foun|dation for rancor or animo&s;ity when per&s;ons differ in e&s;&s;ential points more than in points purely indifferent. With re&s;pect to the lat|ter, which are not &s;uppo&s;ed to be regulated
<PB N="360" REF="361">
by any &s;tandard, individuals are permitted to think for them&s;elves with impunity. The &s;ame liberty is not indulged with re&s;pect to the former: for what rea&s;on, other than that the &s;tandard by which the&s;e are regulated, ought, as we judge, to produce an unifor|mity of opinion in all men? In a word, to this &s;en&s;e of a common &s;tandard mu&s;t be wholly attributed the plea&s;ure we take in tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e the &s;ame principles and opinions with our&s;elves, as well as the aver|&s;ion we have at tho&s;e who differ from us. In matters left indifferent by the &s;tandard, we find nothing of the &s;ame plea&s;ure or pain. A booki&s;h man, unle&s;s &s;way'd by convenience, reli&s;heth not the contempla|tive more than the active part of mankind: his friends and companions are cho&s;en in|differently out of either cla&s;s. A painter con&s;orts with a poet or mu&s;ician, as readily as with tho&s;e of his own art; and one is not the more agreeable to me for loving beef, as I do, nor the le&s;s agreeable for preferring mutton.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that my di&s;gu&s;t is rai&s;ed, not by differing from me, but by differing
<PB N="361" REF="362">
from what I judge to be the common &s;tandard. This point, being of importance, ought to be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed. Men, it is true, are prone to flatter them&s;elves, by ta|king it for granted, that their opinions and their ta&s;te are in all re&s;pects agreeable to the common &s;tandard. But there may be ex|ceptions, and experience &s;hows there are &s;ome. There are in&s;tances without num|ber, of per&s;ons who cling to the gro&s;&s;er a|mu&s;ements of gaming, eating, drinking, without having any reli&s;h for more elegant plea&s;ures, &s;uch, for example, as are afforded by the fine arts. Yet the&s;e very per&s;ons, talking the &s;ame language with the re&s;t of mankind, pronounce in favour of the more elegant plea&s;ures: they invariably approve tho&s;e who have a more refined ta&s;te, and are a&s;hamed of their own as low and &s;en&s;ual. It is in vain to think of giving a rea&s;on for this &s;ingular impartiality again&s;t &s;elf, other than the authority of the common &s;tandard. Every individual of the human &s;pecies, the mo&s;t groveling not excepted, hath a natural &s;en&s;e of the dignity of human nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chap. 11.</NOTE>.
<PB N="362" REF="363">
Hence every man is e&s;teemed and re&s;pected in proportion to the dignity of his character, &s;entiments, and actions. And from the in|&s;tances now given we di&s;cover, that the &s;en&s;e of the dignity of human nature is &s;o vigorous, as even to prevail over &s;elf-par|tiality, and to make us de&s;pi&s;e our own ta&s;te compared with the more elevated ta&s;te of others.</P>
<P>In our &s;en&s;e of a common &s;tandard and in the plea&s;ure individuals give us by their conformity to it, a curious final cau&s;e is di&s;|covered. An uniformity of ta&s;te and &s;enti|ment in matters of importance, forms an intimate connection among individuals, and is a great ble&s;&s;ing in the &s;ocial &s;tate. With re&s;pect to morals in particular, unhappy it would be for mankind did not this unifor|mity prevail: it is nece&s;&s;ary that the ac|tions of all men be uniform with re&s;pect to right and wrong; and in order to uniformi|ty of action, it is nece&s;&s;ary that all men think the &s;ame way in the&s;e particulars: if they differ through any irregular bias, the common &s;en&s;e of mankind is appealed to as the rule; and it is the province of judges,
<PB N="363" REF="364">
in matters e&s;pecially of equity, to apply that rule. The &s;ame uniformity, it is yielded, is not &s;o &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary in other matters of ta&s;te: men, though connected in general as members of the &s;ame &s;tate, are, by birth, office, or occupation, &s;epa|rated and di&s;tingui&s;hed into different cla&s;&s;es; and are thereby qualified for different a|mu&s;ements: variety of ta&s;te, &s;o far, is no ob&s;truction to the general connection. But with re&s;pect to the more capital plea&s;ures, &s;uch as are be&s;t enjoy'd in common, uni|formity of ta&s;te is nece&s;&s;ary for two great ends, fir&s;t to connect individuals the more intimately in the &s;ocial life, and next to ad|vance the&s;e plea&s;ures to their highe&s;t per|fection. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, if in&s;tead of a common ta&s;te, every man had a ta&s;te peculiar to him&s;elf, leading him to place his happine&s;s upon things indifferent or per|haps di&s;agreeable to others, the&s;e capital plea&s;ures could not be enjoy'd in common: every man would pur&s;ue his own happi|ne&s;s by flying from others; and in&s;tead of a natural tendency to union, remarkable in the human &s;pecies, union would be our
<PB N="364" REF="365">
aver&s;ion: man would not be a con&s;i&s;tent being: his intere&s;t would lead him to &s;o|ciety, and his ta&s;te would draw him from it. The other end will be be&s;t explained by entering upon particulars. Uniformity of ta&s;te gives opportunity for &s;umptuous and elegant buildings, for fine gardens, and ex|ten&s;ive embelli&s;hments, which plea&s;e uni|ver&s;ally. Works of this nature could never have reached any degree of perfection, had every man a ta&s;te peculiar to him&s;elf: there could not be any &s;uitable reward, either of profit or honour, to encourage men of ge|nius to labour in &s;uch works. The &s;ame uniformity of ta&s;te is equally nece&s;&s;ary to perfect the arts of mu&s;ic, &s;culpture, and painting; and to &s;upport the expence they require after they are brought to perfection. Nature is in every particular con&s;i&s;tent with her&s;elf. We are formed by nature to have a high reli&s;h for the fine arts, which are a great &s;ource of happine&s;s, and extremely friendly to virtue. We are, at the &s;ame time, formed with an uniformity of ta&s;te, to furni&s;h proper objects for this high reli&s;h: if uniformity of ta&s;te did not prevail, the
<PB N="365" REF="366">
fine arts could never have made any figure.</P>
<P>Thus, upon a &s;en&s;e common to the &s;pecies, is erected a &s;tandard of ta&s;te, which without he&s;itation is apply'd to the ta&s;te of every individual. This &s;tandard, a&s;certain|ing what actions are right what wrong, what proper what improper, hath enabled morali&s;ts to e&s;tabli&s;h rules for our conduct from which no per&s;on is allowed to &s;werve. We have the &s;ame &s;tandard for a&s;certaining in all the fine arts, what is beautiful or ugly, high or low, proper or improper, proportioned or di&s;proportioned. And here, as in morals, we ju&s;tly condemn every ta&s;te that &s;werves from what is thus a&s;certained by the com|mon &s;tandard.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of a rule or &s;tandard for trying the ta&s;te of individuals in the fine arts as well as in morals, is a con&s;iderable ad|vance, but completes not our journey. We have a great way yet to travel. It is made out that there is a &s;tandard: but it is not made out, by what means we &s;hall prevent mi&s;taking a fal&s;e &s;tandard for that of na|ture. If from opinion and practice we en|deavour to a&s;certain the &s;tandard of nature,
<PB N="366" REF="367">
we are betray'd into endle&s;s perplexities. Viewing this matter hi&s;torically, nothing ap|pears more various and more wavering than ta&s;te in the fine arts. If we judge by num|bers, the Gothic ta&s;te of architecture will be preferred before that of Greece; and the Chine&s;e ta&s;te probably before both. It would be endle&s;s, to recount the various ta&s;tes of gardening that have prevailed in different ages, and &s;till prevail in different countries. De&s;pi&s;ing the mode&s;t colouring of nature, women of fa&s;hion in France daub their cheeks with a red powder. Nay, the unnatural &s;welling in the neck, a di&s;ea&s;e peculiar to the inhabitants of the Alps, is reli&s;hed by that people. But we ought not to be di&s;couraged by &s;uch untoward in&s;tan|ces. For do we not find the like contradic|tions with re&s;pect to morals? was it not once held lawful, for a man to expo&s;e his infant children, and, when grown up, to &s;ell them for &s;laves? was it not held e|qually lawful, to puni&s;h children for the crime of their parents? was not the mur|der of an enemy in cold blood an univer&s;al practice? what &s;tronger in&s;tance can be gi|ven,
<PB N="367" REF="368">
than the abominable practice of hu|man &s;acrifices, not le&s;s impious than immo|ral? Such aberrations from the rules of morality, prove only, that men, originally &s;avage and bruti&s;h, acquire not rationality or any delicacy of ta&s;te, till they be long di&s;ciplined in &s;ociety. To a&s;certain the rules of morality, we appeal not to the common &s;en&s;e of &s;avages, but of men in their more perfect &s;tate: and we make the &s;ame ap|peal, in forming the rules that ought to govern the fine arts. In neither can we &s;afely rely on a local or tran&s;itory ta&s;te; but on what is the mo&s;t univer&s;al and the mo&s;t la&s;ting among polite nations.</P>
<P>In this very manner, a &s;tandard for mo|rals has been e&s;tabli&s;hed with a good deal of accuracy; and &s;o well fitted for practice, that in the hand of able judges it is daily ap|ply'd with general &s;atisfaction. The &s;tand|ard of ta&s;te in the fine arts, is not yet brought to &s;uch perfection. And there is an obvious rea&s;on for its &s;lower progre&s;s. The &s;en&s;e of a right and a wrong in action, is con&s;picuous in the brea&s;t of every individual, almo&s;t without exception. The &s;en&s;e of a
<PB N="368" REF="369">
right and a wrong in the fine arts, is more faint and wavering: it is by nature a tender plant, requiring much culture to bring it to maturity: in a barren &s;oil it cannot live; and in any &s;oil, without cultivation, it is weak and &s;ickly. I talk chiefly with rela|tion to its more refined objects: for &s;ome objects make &s;uch lively impre&s;&s;ions of beau|ty, grandeur, and proportion, as without exception to command the general ta&s;te. There appears to me great contrivance, in di&s;tingui&s;hing thus the moral &s;en&s;e from a ta&s;te in the fine arts. The former, as a rule of conduct and as a law we ought to obey, mu&s;t be clear and authoritative. The latter is not intitled to the &s;ame authority, &s;ince it contributes to our plea&s;ure and a|mu&s;ement only. Were it more &s;trong and lively, it would u&s;urp upon our duty, and call off the attention from matters of greater moment. Were it more clear and authori|tative, it would bani&s;h all difference of ta&s;te: a refined ta&s;te would not form a character, nor be intitled to e&s;teem. This would put an end to rival&s;hip, and con&s;e|quently to all improvement.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="370">
But to return to our &s;ubject. However languid and cloudy the common &s;en&s;e of mankind may be with re&s;pect to the fine arts, it is yet the only &s;tandard in the&s;e as well as in morals. And when the matter is attentively con&s;idered, this &s;tandard will be &s;ound le&s;s imperfect than it appears to be at fir&s;t &s;ight. In gathering the common &s;en&s;e of mankind upon morals, we may &s;afely con&s;ult every individual. But with re&s;pect to the fine arts, our method mu&s;t be differ|ent: a wary choice is nece&s;&s;ary; for to collect votes indifferently, will certainly mi&s;|lead us: tho&s;e who depend for food on bodily labour, are totally void of ta&s;te; of &s;uch a ta&s;te at lea&s;t as can be of u&s;e in the fine arts. This con&s;ideration bars the great|er part of mankind; and of the remaining part, many have their ta&s;te corrupted to &s;uch a degree as to unqualify them altogether for voting. The common &s;en&s;e of mankind mu&s;t then be confined to the few that fall not under the&s;e exceptions. But as &s;uch &s;election &s;eems to throw matters again into uncertainty, we mu&s;t be more explicit up|on this branch of our &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="371">
Nothing tends more than voluptuou&s;ne&s;s to corrupt the whole internal frame, and to vitiate our ta&s;te, not only in the fine arts, but even in morals. It never fails, in cour&s;e of time, to extingui&s;h all the &s;ympathetic af|fections, and to bring on a bea&s;tly &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s which leaves nothing of man but the &s;hape. About excluding per&s;ons of this &s;tamp there will be no di&s;pute. Let us next bring un|der trial, the opulent who&s;e chief plea&s;ure is expence. Riches, coveted by mo&s;t men for the &s;ake of &s;uperiority and to command re&s;pect, are generally be&s;tow'd upon co&s;tly furniture, numerous attendants, a princely dwelling, every thing &s;uperb and gorgeous, to amaze and humble all beholders. Sim|plicity, elegance, propriety, and every thing natural, &s;weet, or amiable, are de&s;pi&s;ed or neglected; for the&s;e are not at the com|mand of riches, and make no figure in the public eye. In a word, nothing is reli&s;hed, but what &s;erves to gratify pride, by an ima|gined exaltation of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or above tho&s;e he reckons the vulgar. Such a tenor of life contracts the heart and makes every principle give way to &s;elf-intere&s;t. Benevo|lence
<PB N="371" REF="372">
and public &s;pirit, with all their refined emotions, are little felt and le&s;s regarded. And if the&s;e be excluded, there can be no place for the faint and delicate emotions of the fine arts.</P>
<P>The exclu&s;ion of cla&s;&s;es &s;o many and va|rious, reduces within a narrow compa&s;s tho&s;e who are qualified to be judges in the fine arts. Many circum&s;tances are nece&s;|&s;ary to form a judge of this &s;ort: there mu&s;t be a good natural ta&s;te: this ta&s;te mu&s;t be improved by education, reflection, and ex|perience: it mu&s;t be pre&s;erved alive, by a regular cour&s;e of life, by u&s;ing the goods of fortune with moderation, and by following the dictates of improved nature which gives welcome to every rational plea&s;ure without deviating into exce&s;s. This is the tenor of life which of all contributes the mo&s;t to re|finement of ta&s;te; and the &s;ame tenor of life contributes the mo&s;t to happine&s;s in ge|neral.</P>
<P>If there appear much uncertainty in a &s;tandard that requires &s;o painful and intricate a &s;election, we may po&s;&s;ibly be reconciled to it by the following con&s;ideration, That,
<PB N="372" REF="373">
with re&s;pect to the fine arts, there is le&s;s difference of ta&s;te than is commonly imagi|ned. Nature hath marked all her works with indelible characters of high or low, plain or elegant, &s;trong or weak. The&s;e, if at all perceived, are &s;eldom mi&s;apprehend|ed by any ta&s;te; and the &s;ame marks are e|qually perceptible in works of art. A defec|tive ta&s;te is incurable; and it hurts none but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, becau&s;e it carries no authority to impo&s;e upon others. I know not if there be &s;uch a thing as a ta&s;te naturally bad or wrong; a ta&s;te, for example, that prefers a groveling plea&s;ure before one that is high and elegant. Groveling plea&s;ures are ne|ver preferred: they are only made welcome by tho&s;e who know no better. Differences about objects of ta&s;te, it is true, are endle&s;s: but they generally concern trifles, or po&s;|&s;ibly matters of equal rank where the pre|ference may be given either way with impu|nity. If, on any occa&s;ion, the di&s;pute go deeper and per&s;ons differ where they ought not, a depraved ta&s;te will readily be di&s;co|vered on one or other &s;ide, occa&s;ioned by
<PB N="373" REF="374">
imitation, cu&s;tom, or corrupted manners, &s;uch as are de&s;cribed above.</P>
<P>If, after all that is &s;aid, the &s;tandard of ta&s;te be thought not yet &s;ufficiently a&s;cer|tained, there is &s;till one re&s;ource in which I put great confidence. What I have in view, are the principles that con&s;titute the &s;en&s;itive part of our nature. By means of the&s;e principles, common to all men, a won|derful uniformity is pre&s;erved among the emotions and feelings of different indivi|duals; the &s;ame object making upon every per&s;on the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion; the &s;ame in kind, at lea&s;t, if not in degree. There have been aberrations, as above ob&s;erved, from the&s;e principles; but &s;oon or late they al|ways prevail, by re&s;toring the wanderers to the right track. The uniformity of ta&s;te here accounted for, is the very thing that in other words is termed the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. And this di&s;covery leads us to means for a&s;certaining the common &s;en&s;e of mankind or the &s;tandard of ta&s;te, more un|erringly than the &s;election above in&s;i&s;ted on. Every doubt with relation to this &s;tandard, occa&s;ioned by the practice of different nations
<PB N="374" REF="375">
and different times, may be cleared by ap|plying to the principles that ought to govern the ta&s;te of every individual. In a word, a thorough acquaintance with the&s;e principles will enable us to form the &s;tandard of ta&s;te; and to lay a foundation for this valuable branch of knowledge, is the declared purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent undertaking.</P>

<P N="1">1. CONSIDERING the things I am con|&s;cious of, &s;ome are internal or within my mind, &s;ome external or without. Pa&s;&s;ion, thinking, volition, are internal objects. Objects of &s;ight, of hear|ing, of &s;mell, of touch, of ta&s;te, are exter|nal.</P>

By &s;ight we perceive the qualities of figure, colour, motion, <HI>&amp;c.:</HI> by the ear we perceive the qualities high, low, loud, &s;oft: by touch we perceive rough, &s;mooth, hot, cold, <HI>&amp;c.:</HI> by ta&s;te we perceive &s;weet, &s;our, bitter, <HI>&amp;c.:</HI> by &s;mell we perceive fragrant, &s;tinking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Qualities, from our very conception of them, are not capa|ble of an independent exi&s;tence; but mu&s;t belong to &s;omething of which they are the qualities.

<P N="13">13. That we cannot perceive an external object till an impre&s;&s;ion be made upon our body, is probable from rea&s;on, and is a&s;cer|tained by experience. But it is not nece&s;|&s;ary that we be made &s;en&s;ible of the im|pre&s;&s;ion. It is true, that in touching, ta|&s;ting, and &s;melling, we feel the impre&s;&s;ion made at the organ of &s;en&s;e: but in &s;eeing and hearing, we feel no impre&s;&s;ion.

14. Objects once perceived may be recall|ed to the mind by the power of memory. When I recall an object in this manner, it appears to me the &s;ame as in the origi|nal &s;urvey, only more faint and ob&s;cure. For example, I &s;aw ye&s;terday a &s;preading oak growing on the brink of a river. I en|deavour to recall it to my mind. How is this operation performed? Do I endeavour to form in my mind a picture of it or repre|&s;entative image? Not &s;o.

And in this recollection, I am not con&s;cious of a picture or repre&s;entative image, more than in the original &s;urvey: the perception is of

the tree it&s;elf, as at fir&s;t. I confirm this by another experiment. After attentively &s;ur|veying a fine &s;tatue, I clo&s;e my eyes. What follows? The &s;ame object continues, with|out any difference but that it is le&s;s di&s;tinct than formerly. This indi&s;tinct &s;econdary perception of an object, is termed <HI>an idea.</HI> And therefore the preci&s;e and accurate defi|nition of an idea, in contradi&s;tinction to an original perception, is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That perception or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a real object, which a per&s;on has by exerci&s;ing the power of memory."</Q> Every thing one is con&s;cious of, whether internal or external, pa&s;&s;ions, emotions, thinking, re&s;olving, willing, heat, cold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as well as external objects, may be recalled as above by the power of memory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this definition of an idea, the following propo&s;ition mu&s;t be evident, That there can be no &s;uch thing as an innate idea. If the original perception of an object be not innate, which is obvious, it is not le&s;s obvious, that the idea or &s;e|condary perception of that object cannot be innate. And yet to prove this &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, Locke has be&s;towed a whole book of his treati&s;e upon human under&s;tanding.

Dr Berkeley has ta|ken great pains to prove another propo&s;ition equally evident, That there can be no &s;uch thing as a general idea.

15. The original perceptions of external objects, are either &s;imple or complex. A &s;ound may be &s;o &s;imple as not to be re&s;ol|vable into parts: &s;o may a ta&s;te and a &s;mell. A perception of touch, is generally com|pounded of the more &s;imple perceptions of hardne&s;s or &s;oftne&s;s, joined with &s;moothne&s;s or roughne&s;s, heat or cold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But of all the perceptions of external &s;en&s;e, that of a vi&s;ible object is the mo&s;t complex; be|cau&s;e the eye takes in more particulars than any other organ. A tree is compo&s;ed of its trunk, branches, leaves: it has colour, fi|gure, &s;ize: every one of the&s;e &s;eparately produceth a perception in the mind of the &s;pectator, which are all combined into the complex perception of the tree.</P>
<P N="16">16. The original perception of an object of &s;ight, is more complete, lively, and di&s;|tinct, than that of any other external &s;en&s;e: and for that rea&s;on, an idea or &s;econdary

perception of a vi&s;ible object, is more di&s;|tinct and lively than that of any other object. A fine pa&s;&s;age in mu&s;ic, may, for a mo|ment, be recalled to the mind with tolera|ble accuracy: but the idea of any other ob|ject, and al&s;o of &s;ound after the &s;horte&s;t in|terval, is extremely ob&s;cure.</P>
<P N="17">17. As the range of an individual is com|monly within narrow bounds of &s;pace, op|portunities &s;eldom offer of an enlarged ac|quaintance with external objects. Original perceptions therefore, and their corre&s;pond|ing ideas, are a provi&s;ion too &s;canty for the purpo&s;es of life. Language is an admirable contrivance for &s;upplying this deficiency; for by language, the original perceptions of each individual may be communicated to all; and the &s;ame may be done by painting and other imitative arts. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the mo&s;t lively ideas are the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of being communicated to others. This holds more e&s;pecially when language is the vehicle of communication; for language hitherto has not arrived at any greater perfection than to expre&s;s clear and lively ideas. Hence it is, that poets and o|rators,
<PB N="385" REF="386">
who are extremely &s;ucce&s;sful in de|&s;cribing objects of &s;ight, find objects of the other &s;en&s;es too faint and ob&s;cure for lan|guage. An idea thus acquired of an object at &s;econd hand, ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from an idea of memory; though their re|&s;emblance has occa&s;ioned the &s;ame term to be apply'd to both. This is to be regretted; for when knowledge is to be communicated by language, ambiguity in the &s;ignification of words is a great ob&s;truction to accuracy of conception. Thus nature hath furni&s;hed the means of multiplying ideas without end, and of providing every individual with a &s;ufficient &s;tock to an&s;wer, not only the ne|ce&s;&s;ities, but even the elegancies of life.</P>

The materials employ'd in this opera|tion, are ideas of &s;ight, which may be taken to pieces and combined into new forms at plea&s;ure: their complexity and vivacity make them fit materials. But a man has no &s;uch power over any of his o|ther ideas, whether of the external or in|ternal
<PB N="386" REF="387">
&s;en&s;es: he cannot, after the utmo&s;t effort, combine the&s;e into new forms: his ideas of &s;uch objects are too ob&s;cure for this operation. An image thus fabricated cannot be called a &s;econdary perception, not being derived from an original perception: the poverty of language however, as in the ca&s;e immediately above mentioned, has occa&s;ion|ed the &s;ame term <HI>idea</HI> to be apply'd to all. This &s;ingular power of fabricating images independent of real objects, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name <HI>imagination.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. As ideas are the chief materials em|ploy'd in thinking, rea&s;oning, and reflect|ing, it is of con&s;equence that their nature and differences be under&s;tood. It appears now, that ideas may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three kinds; fir&s;t, Ideas or &s;econdary per|ceptions, properly termed <HI>ideas of memory;</HI> &s;econd, Ideas communicated by language or other &s;igns; and, third, Ideas of imagi|nation. The&s;e ideas differ from each other in many re&s;pects; but the chief foundation of the di&s;tinction is the difference of their cau&s;es. The fir&s;t kind are derived from real exi&s;tences that have been objects of our
<PB N="387" REF="388">
&s;en&s;es: language is the cau&s;e of the &s;econd, or any other &s;ign that has the &s;ame power with language; and a man's imagination is to him&s;elf the cau&s;e of the third. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to add, that an idea, origi|nally of imagination, being convey'd to others by language or any other vehicle, becomes in the mind of tho&s;e to whom it is convey'd an idea of the &s;econd kind; and again, that an idea of this kind, being afterward re|called to the mind, becomes in that circum|&s;tance an idea of memory.</P>
<P N="20">20. Human nature is not &s;o con&s;tituted, as that its objects are perceived with indif|ferency: the&s;e, with very few exceptions, rai&s;e in us either plea&s;ant or painful emo|tions. External objects, at the &s;ame time, appear in them&s;elves agreeable or di&s;agree|able; but with &s;ome difference betwixt tho&s;e which produce organic impre&s;&s;ions, and tho&s;e which affect us from a di&s;tance. When we touch a &s;oft and &s;mooth body, we have a plea&s;ant feeling as at the place of contact; and this feeling we di&s;tingui&s;h not, at lea&s;t not accurately, from the agreeable|ne&s;s of the body it&s;elf. The &s;ame holds
<PB N="388" REF="389">
in general with regard to all the organic impre&s;&s;ions. It is otherwi&s;e in hearing and &s;eeing. A &s;ound is perceived as in it&s;elf a|greeable; and, at the &s;ame time, rai&s;es in the hearer a plea&s;ant emotion: an object of &s;ight appears in it&s;elf agreeable; and, at the &s;ame time, rai&s;es in the &s;eer a plea&s;ant emotion. The&s;e are accurately di&s;tingui&s;h|ed. The plea&s;ant emotion is felt as within the mind: the agreeablene&s;s of the object is placed upon the object, and is perceived as one of its qualities or properties. The a|greeable appearance of an object of &s;ight, is termed <HI>beauty;</HI> and the di&s;agreeable appear|ance of &s;uch an object is termed <HI>ugline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. But though beauty and ugline&s;s, in their proper and genuine &s;ignification, are confined to objects of &s;ight; yet in a more lax and figurative &s;ignification, they are ap|ply'd to objects of the other &s;en&s;es. They are &s;ometimes apply'd even to ab&s;tract terms; for it is not unu&s;ual to &s;ay, <HI>a beauti|ful theorem, a beautiful con&s;titution of govern|ment.</HI> But I am inclined to think, that we are led to u&s;e &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion by conceiving
<PB N="389" REF="390">
the thing as delineated upon paper, and as in &s;ome &s;ort an object of &s;ight.</P>
<P N="22">22. A line compo&s;ed by a preci&s;e rule, is perceived and &s;aid to be regular. A &s;traight line, a parabola, a hyperbola, the circumfe|rence of a circle, and of an ellip&s;e, are all of them regular lines. A figure compo&s;ed by a preci&s;e rule, is perceived and &s;aid to be regular. Thus a circle, a &s;quare, a hexa|gon, an equilateral triangle, are regular fi|gures, being compo&s;ed by a rule that deter|mines the form of each. When the form of a line or of a figure is a&s;certained by a rule that leaves nothing arbitrary, the line and the figure are &s;aid to be perfectly regu|lar: this is the ca&s;e of the figures now men|tioned; and it is the ca&s;e of a &s;traight line and of the circumference of a circle. A fi|gure and a line are not perfectly regular where any part or circum&s;tance is left arbi|trary. A parallelogram and a rhomb are le&s;s regular than a &s;quare: the parallelogram is &s;ubjected to no rule as to the length of &s;ides, other than that the oppo&s;ite &s;ides be equal: the rhomb is &s;ubjected to no rule as to its angles, other than that the oppo&s;ite angles be
<PB N="390" REF="391">
equal. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the circumfe|rence of an ellip&s;e, the form of which is &s;u&s;ceptible of much variety, is le&s;s regular than that of a circle.</P>
<P N="23">23. Regularity, properly &s;peaking, be|longs, like beauty, to objects of &s;ight: like beauty, it is al&s;o apply'd figuratively to other objects. Thus we &s;ay, <HI>a regular govern|ment, a regular compo&s;ition of mu&s;ic,</HI> and, <HI>re|gular di&s;cipline.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. When two figures are compo&s;ed of &s;imilar parts, they are &s;aid to be uniform. Perfect uniformity is where the con&s;tituent parts of two figures are preci&s;ely &s;imilar to each other. Thus two cubes of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions are perfectly uniform in all their parts. An imperfect uniformity is, where the parts mutually corre&s;pond, but without being preci&s;ely &s;imilar. The uniformity is imperfect betwixt two &s;quares or cubes of unequal dimen&s;ions; and &s;till more &s;o be|twixt a &s;quare and a parallelogram.</P>
<P N="25">25. Uniformity is al&s;o applicable to the con&s;tituent parts of the &s;ame figure. The con&s;tituent parts of a &s;quare are perfectly uniform: its &s;ides are equal and its angles
<PB N="391" REF="392">
are equal. Wherein then differs regularity from uniformity? for a figure compo&s;ed of &s;imilar or uniform parts mu&s;t undoubtedly be regular. Regularity is predicated of a fi|gure con&s;idered as a whole compo&s;ed of re|&s;embling or uniform parts: uniformity a|gain is predicated of the&s;e parts as related to each other by re&s;emblance. We &s;ay, a &s;quare is a regular, not an uniform figure: but with re&s;pect to the con&s;tituent parts of a &s;quare, we &s;ay not that they are regular, but that they are uniform.</P>
<P N="26">26. In things de&s;tined for the &s;ame u&s;e, as legs, arms, eyes, windows, &s;poons, we expect uniformity. Proportion ought to govern parts intended for different u&s;es. We require a certain proportion betwixt a leg and an arm; in the ba&s;e, the &s;haft, the capital, of a pillar; and in the length, the breadth, the height, of a room. Some pro|portion is al&s;o required in different things intimately connected, as betwixt a dwell|ing-hou&s;e, the garden, and the &s;tables. But we require no proportion among things &s;lightly connected, as betwixt the table a man writes on and the dog that follows him.
<PB N="392" REF="393">
Proportion and uniformity never coincide: things perfectly &s;imilar are uniform; but proportion is never applied to them: the four &s;ides and angles of a &s;quare are equal and perfectly uniform; but we &s;ay not that they are proportional. Thus, proportion always implies inequality or difference; but then it implies it to a certain degree only: the mo&s;t agreeable proportion re&s;embles a <HI>ma|ximum</HI> in mathematics; a greater or le&s;s in|equality or difference is le&s;s agreeable.</P>
<P N="27">27. Order regards various particulars. Fir&s;t, in tracing or &s;urveying objects, we are directed by a &s;en&s;e of order: we con|ceive it to be more orderly, that we &s;hould pa&s;s from a principle to its acce&s;&s;ories and from a whole to its parts, than in the contrary direction. Next, with re&s;pect to the po&s;ition of things, a &s;en&s;e of order di|rects us to place together things intimately connected. Thirdly, in placing things that have no natural connection, that order appears the mo&s;t perfect, where the parti|culars are made to bear the &s;tronge&s;t relation to each other that po&s;ition can give them. Thus paralleli&s;m is the &s;tronge&s;t relation
<PB N="393" REF="394">
that po&s;ition can be&s;tow upon &s;traight lines. If they be &s;o placed as by production to in|ter&s;ect each other, the relation is le&s;s per|fect. A large body in the middle and two equal bodies of le&s;s &s;ize, one on each &s;ide, is an order that produces the &s;tronge&s;t relation the bodies are &s;u&s;ceptible of by po&s;ition. The relation betwixt the two equal bodies would be &s;tronger by juxtapo&s;ition; but they would not both have the &s;ame relation to the third.</P>
<P N="28">28. The beauty or agreeablene&s;s of an object, as it enters into the original percep|tion, enters al&s;o into the &s;econdary percep|tion or idea. An idea of imagination is al&s;o agreeable; though in a lower degree than an idea of memory, where the objects are of the &s;ame kind. But this defect in the ideas of imagination is abundantly &s;upply'd by their greatne&s;s and variety. For the i|magination acting without control, can fa|bricate ideas of finer vi&s;ible objects, of more noble and heroic actions, of greater wic|kedne&s;s, of more &s;urpri&s;ing events, than ever in fact exi&s;ted. And by communicating the&s;e ideas in words, painting, &s;culpture,
<PB N="394" REF="395">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> the influence of the imagination is not le&s;s exten&s;ive than great.</P>
<P N="29">29. In the nature of every man, there is &s;omewhat original, that &s;erves to di&s;tingui&s;h him from others, that tends to form a cha|racter, and, with the concurrence of ex|ternal accidents, to make him meek or fie|ry, candid or deceitful, re&s;olute or timorous, chearful or moro&s;e. This original bent is termed <HI>di&s;po&s;ition.</HI> Which mu&s;t be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from a <HI>principle:</HI> no original bent obtains the latter appellation, but what be|longs to the whole &s;pecies. A principle makes part of the common nature of man: a di&s;po&s;ition makes part of the nature of this or that man. A <HI>propen&s;ity</HI> compre|hends both; for it &s;ignifies indifferently ei|ther a principle or a di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="30">30. <HI>Affection,</HI> &s;ignifying a &s;ettled bent of mind toward a particular being or thing, oc|cupies a middle place betwixt propen&s;ity on the one hand, and pa&s;&s;ion on the other. A propen&s;ity being original, mu&s;t exi&s;t before any opportunity be offered to exert it: af|fection can never be original; becau&s;e, ha|ving a &s;pecial relation to a particular object,
<PB N="395" REF="396">
it cannot exi&s;t till the object be pre&s;ented. Again, pa&s;&s;ion depends on the pre&s;ence of the object, in idea at lea&s;t, if not in reality: when the idea vani&s;hes, the pa&s;&s;ion vani&s;hes with it. Affection, on the contrary, once &s;ettled on a per&s;on, is a la&s;ting connection; and, like other connections, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts even when we do not think of it. A familiar example will clear the whole. There may be in the mind a propen&s;ity to gratitude, which, through want of an object, happens never to be exerted, and which therefore is never di&s;covered even by the per&s;on who has it. Another who has the &s;ame propen&s;ity, meets with a kindly office that makes him grateful to his benefactor: an intimate con|nection is formed betwixt them, termed <HI>affection;</HI> which, like other connections, has a permanent exi&s;tence, though not always in view. The affection, for the mo&s;t part, lies dormant, till an opportunity offer of ex|erting it: in this circum&s;tance, it is convert|ed into the pa&s;&s;ion of gratitude; and the opportunity is greedily &s;eized for te&s;tifying gratitude in the mo&s;t complete manner.</P>
<P N="31">31. <HI>Aver&s;ion,</HI> I think, mu&s;t be oppo&s;ed

Therefore &s;ounds are &s;weeter, as well as greater, in the night than in the day: and I &s;uppo&s;e they are &s;weeter to blind men than to others: and it is manife&s;t that between &s;leeping and waking, when all the &s;en&s;es are bound and &s;u&s;pended, mu&s;ic is far &s;weeter than when one is fully waking.</NOTE>.

In an indolent &s;tate, or in a reverie, objects make but a &s;light impre&s;&s;ion; far from what they make when they command our atten|tion. In a train of perceptions, no &s;ingle object makes &s;uch a figure as it would do &s;ingle and apart: for when the attention is divided among many objects, no &s;ingle ob|ject is intitled to a large &s;hare. Hence the &s;tillne&s;s of night contributes to terror, there being nothing to divert the attention.

<P N="35">35. <HI>Genus, &s;pecies, modification,</HI> are terms invented to di&s;tingui&s;h beings from each o|ther. Individuals are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their qualities: a large cla&s;s of individuals enjoy|ing qualities in common, is termed a <HI>genus:</HI> a &s;ubdivi&s;ion of &s;uch cla&s;s is termed a <HI>&s;pe|cies.</HI> Again, that circum&s;tance which di&s;|tingui&s;heth one genus, one &s;pecies, or e|ven one individual, from another, is term|ed
<PB N="400" REF="401">
a <HI>modification:</HI> the &s;ame particular that is termed a <HI>property</HI> or <HI>quality</HI> when con&s;i|dered as belonging to an individual or a cla&s;s of individuals, is termed a <HI>modification</HI> when con&s;idered as di&s;tingui&s;hing the individual or the cla&s;s from another. A black &s;kin and &s;oft curled hair, are properties of a ne|gro: the &s;ame circum&s;tances con&s;idered as marks that di&s;tingui&s;h a negro from a man of a different &s;pecies, are denominated <HI>mo|difications.</HI></P>
<P N="36">36. Objects of &s;ight, being complex, are di&s;tingui&s;hable into the &s;everal particulars that enter into the compo&s;ition: the&s;e ob|jects are all of them coloured; and they all have length, breadth, and thickne&s;s. When I behold a &s;preading oak, I di&s;tingui&s;h in this object, &s;ize, figure, colour, and &s;ome|times motion: viewing a flowing river, I di&s;tingui&s;h colour, figure, and con&s;tant mo|tion: a dye has colour, black &s;pots, &s;ix plain &s;urfaces, all equal and uniform. The objects of touch, have all of them exten&s;ion. Some of them are felt rough, &s;ome &s;mooth: &s;ome of them are hard, &s;ome &s;oft. With re&s;pect to the other &s;en&s;es, &s;ome of their ob|jects
<PB N="401" REF="402">
are &s;imple, &s;ome complex: a &s;ound, a ta&s;te, a &s;mell, may be &s;o &s;imple as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hable into any parts: others are perceived to be compounded of different &s;ounds, different ta&s;tes, and different &s;mells.</P>
<P N="37">37. The eye at one look can take in a number of objects, as of trees in a field, or men in a crowd: as the&s;e objects are di&s;tinct from each other, each having a &s;eparate and independent exi&s;tence, they are di&s;tin|gui&s;hable in the mind as well as in reality; and there is nothing more ea&s;y, than to ab&s;|tract from &s;ome and to confine our con|templation to others. A large oak with its &s;preading branches, fixes our attention upon it&s;elf, and ab&s;tracts us from the &s;hrubs that &s;urround it. In the &s;ame manner, with re&s;pect to compounded &s;ounds, ta&s;tes, or &s;mells, we can fix our thoughts upon any one of the component parts, ab&s;tracting our attention from the re&s;t. But the power of ab&s;traction is not confined to objects that are &s;eparable in reality as well as mentally: it al&s;o takes place where there can be no real &s;eparation. The &s;ize, the figure, the colour, of a tree, are in&s;eparably connected,
<PB N="402" REF="403">
and cannot exi&s;t independent of each other: the &s;ame of length, breadth, and thickne&s;s: and yet we can mentally confine our ob|&s;ervations to one of the&s;e, neglecting or ab&s;|tracting from the re&s;t. Here ab&s;traction takes place where there cannot be a real &s;eparation.</P>
<P N="38">38. This power of ab&s;traction is of great utility. A carpenter con&s;iders a log of wood, with regard to hardne&s;s, firmne&s;s, colour, and texture: a philo&s;opher, neglect|ting the&s;e properties, makes the log under|go a chymical analy&s;is; and examines its ta&s;te, its &s;mell, and its component princi|ples: the geometrician confines his rea&s;on|ing to the figure, the length, breadth, and thickne&s;s. In general, every arti&s;t, ab&s;tract|ing from all other properties, confines his ob&s;ervations to tho&s;e which have a more im|mediate connection with his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="39">39. Hence clearly appears the meaning of an <HI>ab&s;tract term,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;tract idea.</HI> If in viewing an object, we can ab&s;tract from &s;ome of its parts or properties, and attach our&s;elves to others; there mu&s;t be the &s;ame facility, when we recall this object to the
<PB N="403" REF="404">
mind in idea. This leads directly to the definition of an ab&s;tract idea, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A par|tial view of a complex object, limited to one or more of the component parts or properties, laying a&s;ide or ab&s;tracting from others."</Q> A word that denotes an ab&s;tract idea, is called an <HI>ab&s;tract term.</HI></P>
<P N="40">40. The power of ab&s;traction is be&s;towed upon man, for the purpo&s;es &s;olely of rea|&s;oning. It tends greatly to the facility as well as clearne&s;s of any proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, that, withdrawing from every other circum|&s;tance, we can confine our attention to the &s;ingle property we de&s;ire to inve&s;tigate.</P>
<P N="41">41. Ab&s;tract ideas, may, I think, be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three different kinds, all equally &s;ub&s;ervient to the rea&s;oning faculty. Individuals appear to have no end; and did we not po&s;&s;e&s;s the faculty of di&s;tributing them into cla&s;&s;es, the mind would be lo&s;t in an endle&s;s variety, and no progre&s;s be made in knowledge. It is by the faculty of ab&s;traction that we di&s;tribute beings into <HI>genera</HI> and <HI>&s;pecies:</HI> finding a number of individuals connected by certain qualities common to all, we give a name to the&s;e
<PB N="404" REF="405">
individuals con&s;idered as thus connected; which name, by gathering them together into one cla&s;s, &s;erves in a curt manner to expre&s;s the whole of the&s;e individuals as di&s;tinct from others. Thus the word <HI>ani|mal</HI> &s;erves to denote every being which hath &s;elf-motion; and the words <HI>man, hor&s;e, lion, &amp;c.</HI> an&s;wer &s;imilar purpo&s;es. This is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t common &s;ort of ab&s;trac|tion; and it is of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive u&s;e, by enabling us to comprehend in our rea|&s;oning whole kinds and &s;orts, in&s;tead of in|dividuals without end. The next &s;ort of ab&s;tract ideas and terms comprehends a number of individual objects con&s;idered as connected by &s;ome occa&s;ional relation. A great number of per&s;ons collected together in one place, without any other relation but merely that of contiguity, are deno|minated <HI>a crowd:</HI> in forming this term, we ab&s;tract from &s;ex, from age, from condition, from dre&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A number of per&s;ons connected by being &s;ubject|ed to the &s;ame laws and to the &s;ame go|vernment, are termed <HI>a nation;</HI> and a number of men &s;ubjected to the &s;ame mili|tary
<PB N="405" REF="406">
command, are termed <HI>an army.</HI> A third &s;ort of ab&s;traction is, where a &s;ingle property or part, which may be common to many individuals, is &s;elected to be the &s;ubject of our contemplation; for example, whitene&s;s, heat, beauty, length, roundne&s;s, head, arm.</P>
<P N="42">42. Ab&s;tract terms are a happy invention: it is by their means chiefly, that the particu|lars which we make the &s;ubject of our rea|&s;oning, are brought into clo&s;e union, and &s;e|parated from all others however naturally connected. Without the aid of &s;uch terms, the mind could never be kept &s;teady to its proper &s;ubject, but would perpetually be in hazard of a&s;&s;uming foreign circum&s;tances or neglecting what are e&s;&s;ential. In a word, a general term denotes in a curt man|ner certain objects occa&s;ionally combined. We can, without the aid of language, com|pare real objects by intuition, when the&s;e objects are pre&s;ent; and, when ab&s;ent, we can compare them by means of the ideas we have of them: but when we advance farther, and attempt to make inferences, and draw conclu&s;ions, we always employ
<PB N="406" REF="407">
ab&s;tract terms, even in thinking. It would be as difficult to rea&s;on without them, as to perform operations in al|gebra without &s;igns: for there is &s;carce any rea&s;oning without &s;ome degree of ab&s;|traction; and we cannot ab&s;tract to pur|po&s;e without making u&s;e of general terms. Hence it follows, that without language man would &s;carce be a rational being.</P>
<P N="43">43. The &s;ame thing, in different re&s;pects, has different names. With re&s;pect to cer|tain qualities, it is termed a <HI>&s;ub&s;tance;</HI> with re&s;pect to other qualities, a <HI>body;</HI> and with re&s;pect to qualities of all &s;orts, a <HI>&s;ubject:</HI> it is termed a <HI>pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubject</HI> with re&s;pect to an action exerted upon it; an <HI>object</HI> with re|&s;pect to a percipient; a <HI>cau&s;e</HI> with re&s;pect to the effect it produces; and an <HI>effect</HI> with re&s;pect to its cau&s;e.</P>
