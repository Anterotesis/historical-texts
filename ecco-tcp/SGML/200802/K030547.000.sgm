<L>TO holy land in &s;uper&s;tition's day,</L>
<L>When bare foot pilgrims trode their weary way,</L>
<L>By mother church's unremitting law</L>
<L>Scourg'd into grace, with &s;houlders red and raw;</L>
<L>Kneeling demure before the &s;acred &s;hrine,</L>
<L>On the hard flint th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y begg'd the boon divine;</L>
<L>Pardon for what offending fle&s;h had done,</L>
<L>And pity for the long long cour&s;e they'd run,</L>
<L>Fines, pains and penalties, &s;ecurely pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Slow pac'd forgivene&s;s met their prayer at la&s;t,</L>
<L>Full ab&s;olution from conceeding Rome,</L>
<L>Cancell'd all &s;in, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and to come.</L>
<L>Your Poet thus prophanely led a&s;ide</L>
<L>To range o'er Tragic land without a guide,</L>
<L>To pick perhaps, with no invidious aim,</L>
<L>A few ca&s;t fallings from the tree of fame.</L>
<L>Damn'd, tho' untried, by the de&s;potic rule</L>
<L>Of the &s;tern Doctors in detraction's &s;chool;</L>
<L>La&s;h'd down each column of a public page,</L>
<L>And driv'n o'er burning plough&s;hares to the &s;tage,</L>
<L>Be rhim'd, be ridicul'd with doggrel wit,</L>
<L>Sues out a pardon from his Pope&mdash;<HI>the Pit.</HI></L>
<L>Pen&s;ive he &s;tands in penitential weeds,</L>

<L><HI>Ave Apollo's</HI> to the God of ver&s;e;</L>
<L>And &s;ure there's no one but an Author knows</L>
<L>The Penance, which an Author undergoes.</L>
<L>If then your wor&s;hips a few &s;tripes award</L>
<L>Let not your beadles lay them on too hard;</L>
<L>For in the world there's not a thing &s;o thin,</L>
<L>So full of feeling, as your Poet's &s;kin:</L>
<L>What if, perchance, he &s;natch'd a playful ki&s;s</L>
<L>From that free hearted romp the Comic Mi&s;s;</L>
<L>That frolick's pa&s;t, he's turn'd to years of grace,</L>
<L>And a young &s;inner now &s;upplies his place.</L>
<L>Sure you'll not grudge a little &s;ober chat</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by MISS YOUNGE.</STAGE>
<L>FROM ancient The&s;pis to the pre&s;ent age</L>
<L>The world hath oft been term'd a public &s;tage,</L>
<L>A thread-bare metaphor, which in its time</L>
<L>Hath patch'd much pro&s;e and heel-piec'd many a rhime;</L>
<L>Ev'n the grave pulpit &s;ometimes <HI>deigns</HI> to u&s;e</L>
<L>The emphatic terms of the pro&s;cribed Mu&s;e,</L>
<L>Calls birth our entry, death our exit calls,</L>
<L>And at life's clo&s;e exclaims&mdash;the curtain falls;</L>
<L>And &s;o concludes upon the drama's plan</L>
<L>That fretting, &s;trutting, &s;hort-hour actor, man.</L>
<L><HI>Are we all actors then?</HI>&mdash;yes, all from Adam,</L>
<L><HI>And actre&s;&s;es?</HI>&mdash;I apprehend &s;o Madam.</L>
<L>Some fill their ca&s;t with grace, others with none,</L>
<L>Some are &s;hov'd off the &s;tage, and &s;ome &s;hov'd on;</L>
<L>Some good, &s;ome bad, &s;till we all act a part,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t we di&s;gui&s;e the language of the heart;</L>
<L>Nature's plain ta&s;te provides a &s;imple treat,</L>
<L>But art, the <HI>Cook,</HI> &s;teps in and mars the meat;</L>
<L>The comic blade makes ridicule his te&s;t,</L>
<L>And on his tomb proclaims that life's a je&s;t,</L>
<L>The &s;waggering braggart, in true tragic ca&s;t,</L>
<L>Bellows blank ver&s;e and daggers to the la&s;t;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t clubs of neutral petit-maitres boa&s;t</L>
<L>A kind of opera company at mo&s;t,</L>
<L>Who&s;e dre&s;s, air, action, all is imitation,</L>
<L>A poor, in&s;ipid, &s;ervile, French tran&s;lation;</L>

<L>'Till all awaken'd by the rattling die</L>
<L>Club wits, and make&mdash;a modern tragedy;</L>
<L>A tragedy alas! good friends, look round,</L>
<L>What have we left to tread but tragic ground?</L>
<L>Four authors leagu'd to &s;hake the human &s;oul,</L>
<L>Un&s;heath the dagger, and infu&s;e the bowl,</L>
<L>At length de&s;cending to the lea&s;t, and la&s;t,</L>
<L>We hope the terror of the time is pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Full &s;ated now with battle, blood, and murder,</L>
<L>England is conquer'd&mdash;fate can reach no further,</L>
<L>Bid then the weeping <HI>Pleiads</HI> dry their eyes,</L>
