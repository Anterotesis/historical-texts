<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the Hours of Meditation, when the Mind was on its re&s;earches for a Pa|trone&s;s to the following Petit Drama, I was not long at a lo&s;s for One to whom I might with propriety pay my re&s;pects. The very con&s;picuous figure you have made upon the Stage, brought your Merits to my view, and from tho&s;e I thought there could be no im|propriety in my laying this Trifle at your feet. The tutelary Si&s;ters, Melpomene and Thalia, who pre&s;ide over all the Scenic Arts, have taken you by the hand and placed you on a pede&s;tal &s;o high, that Envy lowers her &s;cowling front whene'er &s;he ca&s;ts her jaundiced Eye upon your exalted Station, for you ju&s;tly a&s;&s;imulate the pathetic man|ners of the one, and fa&s;cinate with the
<PB REF="4">
bewitching archne&s;s of the other. This perhaps may look like flattery, but tho&s;e who know me, know <HI>that flattery is a talent which I never yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> and, for the want of which, perhaps I may have hatched &s;ome Snakes and Scorpions who have endeavoured to breathe their venom upon the blo&s;&s;oms of my reputation. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance certain malevolant Com|petiters attempted to &s;ting my ri&s;ing hopes and di&s;concert the eminent and arduous ex|ertions of the Performers, to whom I am &s;o much indebted on this Piece's fir&s;t a&s;&s;ay;&mdash;yet I had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee it baffle all their Spleen, and now, Madam, I &s;ubmit it to the APPROBATION of the PUBLIC, and hope it will receive your PROTECTION.</P>

<P>THE PRINTER begs leave to ob&s;erve that the Reviewers of Theatricals in the MORNING HERALD and other re&s;pectable PRINTS, who &s;aw the Repre&s;entation as well as the Editors of the LONDON, EUROPEAN, NEW LADY'S, and other MAGAZINES, have &s;poken of this New Piece in very Re&s;pectful Terms. <Q REND="inline">"That it is replete with wit, whim, and good humour, and exhibits a well timed &s;atire on the bent of fanciful individuals, demon|&s;trating that <HI>Every Man</HI> has his <HI>Hobby,</HI> and that all mankind, are, at &s;ome period of Life or other, the <HI>Dupes of Fancy.</HI> Upon the whole they pro|nounce this Farce to &s;urpa&s;s mediocrity, and that its merits ju&s;tly de&s;erve that kind reception from the Public which it has experienced."</Q> The Author is well known to the world by his Lectures on Mi|micry, Imitations, and other humourous writings;
<PB REF="6">
and all lovers of dramatic productions and the Pub|lic in general will be highly gratified by a &s;ight and peru&s;al of this Comic Piece.</P>
<P>On it's fir&s;t appearance at the Hay Market, &s;ome objections were made to it's <HI>length,</HI> particularly in the Dinner Scene, but by the Author's Judicious curtailment for future Repre&s;entation, every objection of this kind will be obviated.
