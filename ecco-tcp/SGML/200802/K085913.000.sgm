But we were &s;o kind|ly u&s;ed, that at la&s;t we plucked up Heart of Grace, and told the Ba&s;haw all our Misfortunes. What do you think he did? He gave us our Li|berty, &s;et us up in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, and ever &s;ince we have &s;erved the whole Seraglio with Fi&s;h.&mdash;But if I &s;tand idling here, I &s;hall he &s;colded by my old Man&mdash;Ah! you &s;mile at that&mdash;And well you may&mdash;He &s;cold me!&mdash;Poor Soul&mdash;</P>

have &s;een nothing but &s;miling Days. 'Tis true, when we fir&s;t fettled, the Indians came down upon us, and plundered us of all we had, and from the Fright, and one Thing or other, I had like to have died of a Fever; and once when he was at Sea, he was very near being &s;wallowed up by a Shark; we were afterwards &s;hip-wrecked, then &s;old for Slaves, after that we were confined in a clo&s;e Dungeon, and every Body &s;aid, we &s;hould certainly be &s;trangled. But no Matter for that; we had no bad Actions to tax our&s;elves with, and we were determined not to be frightened at any Thing.</P>
