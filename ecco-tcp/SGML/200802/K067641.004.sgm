<HEAD>Mrs. MANLEY,</HEAD>
<P>THE celebrated authore&s;s of the Atalantis, was born in Hamp&s;hire, in one of tho&s;e i&s;lands which formerly belonged to France, of which her fa|ther Sir Roger Manley was governor, who afterwards enjoyed the &s;ame po&s;t in other places in England. He was the &s;econd &s;on of an ancient family; the better part of his e&s;tate was ruined in the civil war by his firm adherence to Charles I. He had not the &s;atisfaction of ever being taken notice of, nor was his loyalty acknowledged at the re&s;toration. The governor was a brave gallant man, of great honour and integrity.</P>
<P>He became a &s;cholar in the mid&s;t of the camp, having left the univer&s;ity at the age of &s;ixteen, to follow the fortunes of Charles I. His temper had too much of the Stoic in it to attend much to the intere&s;t of his family: After a life &s;pent in the civil and foreign wars, he began to love ea&s;e and retire|ment, devoting him&s;elf to his &s;tudy, and the charge of his little po&s;t, without following the court; his great virtue and mode&s;ty, debaring him from &s;ol|liciting favours from &s;uch per&s;ons as were then at the helm of affairs, his de&s;erts were buried, and forgotten. In this &s;olitude he wrote &s;everal tracts for his own amu&s;ement, particularly his Latin Commentaries of the Civil Wars of England. He was likewi&s;e author of the fir&s;t volume of that admired work, the Turki&s;h Spy. One Dr. Midgley, an ingenious phy&s;ician, related to the family by marriage, had the charge of looking over his papers. Among&s;t them he found
<PB N="5" REF="8">
that manu&s;cript, which he re&s;erved to his proper u&s;e, and by his own pen, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome others, continued the work till the eighth volume was fini&s;hed, without having the hone&s;ty to acknowledge the author of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The governor likewi&s;e wrote the Hi&s;tory of the Rebellion in England, Scotland and Ireland; wherein the mo&s;t material pa&s;&s;ages, battles, &s;ieges, policies, and &s;tratagems of war, are impartially related on both &s;ides, from the year 1640, to the beheading of the duke of Monmouth 1688, in three parts, printed in octavo, in the year 1691.</P>
<P>His daughter, our authore&s;s, received an education &s;uitable to her birth, and gave very early di&s;co|veries of a genius, not only above her years, but much &s;uperior to what is u&s;ually to be found among&s;t her own &s;ex. She had the misfortune to lo&s;e her mother, while &s;he was yet an infant, a circum&s;tance, which laid the foundation of many calamities, which afterwards befell her.</P>
<P>The brother of Sir Roger Manley, who was of principles very oppo&s;ite to his, joined with the Par|liamentarian party; and after Charles I. had &s;uffered, he engaged with great zeal in the cau&s;e of tho&s;e who were for &s;ettling a new form of government, in which, however, they were di&s;appointed by the addre&s;s of Cromwell, who found means to transfer the govern|ment into his own hands, and in place of in&s;titut|ing a republic, re&s;tored monarchy under another name, and erected a tyranny as dangerous, perhaps, in its con&s;equences, as that which he had contributed to overthrow. During the&s;e heats and divi&s;ions, Mr. Manley, who adhered to the mo&s;t powerful party, was fortunate enough to ama&s;s an e&s;tate, and purcha&s;ed a title; but the&s;e, upon the re&s;tora|tion, reverted back to the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; &s;o that he was left with &s;everal &s;mall children un|provided for. The elde&s;t of the&s;e orphans, Sir Roger Manley took under his protection, be&s;towed
<PB N="6" REF="9">
a very liberal education on him, and endeavoured to in&s;pire his mind with other principles, than tho&s;e he had received from his father. This young gentleman had very promi&s;ing parts, but under the appearance of an open &s;implicity, he concealed the mo&s;t treacherous hypocri&s;y. Sir Roger, who had a high opinion of his nephew's honour, as well as of his great abilities, on his death|bed bequeathed to him the care of our authore&s;s, and her younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>This man had from nature a very happy ad|dre&s;s, formed to win much upon the hearts of unexperienced girls; and his two cou&s;ins re&s;pected him greatly. He placed them at the hou&s;e of an old, out-of-fa&s;hion aunt, who had been a keen partizan of the royal cau&s;e during the civil wars; &s;he was full of the heroic &s;tiffne&s;s of her own times, and would read books of Chivalry, and Romances with her &s;pectacles.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of conver&s;ation, much infected the mind of our poete&s;s, and fill'd her imagination with lovers, heroes, and princes; made her think her|&s;elf in an inchanted region, and that all the men who approached her were knights errant. In a few years the old aunt died, and left the two young ladies without any controul; which as &s;oon as their cou&s;in Mr. Manley heard, he ha&s;ted into the country, to vi&s;it them; appeared in deep mourning, as he &s;aid for the death of his wife; upon which the young ladies congratulated him, as they knew his wife was a woman of a mo&s;t turbulent temper, and ill fitted to render the con|jugal life tolerable.</P>
<P>This gentleman, who had &s;een a great deal of the world, and was acquainted with all the artifices of &s;educing, lo&s;t no time in making love to his cou&s;in, who was no otherwi&s;e plea&s;ed with it, than as it an&s;wered &s;omething to the character &s;he had found in tho&s;e books, which had poi&s;oned and deluded
<PB N="7" REF="10">
her drawning rea&s;on. Soon after the&s;e prote&s;tations of love were made, the young lady fell into a fever, which was like to prove fatal to her life.</P>
<P>The lover and her &s;i&s;ter never quitted the cham|ber for &s;ixteen nights, nor took any other repo&s;e than throwing them&s;elves alternately upon a little pallet in the &s;ame room. Having in her na|ture a great deal of gratitude, and a very tender &s;en&s;e of benefits; &s;he promi&s;ed upon her recovery to marry her guardian, which as &s;oon as her health was &s;ufficiently re&s;tored, &s;he performed in the pre|&s;ence of a maid &s;ervant, her &s;i&s;ter, and a gentleman who had married a relation. In a word, &s;he was married, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and ruin'd.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band of our poete&s;s brought her to London, fixed her in a remote quarter of it, forbad her to &s;tir out of doors, or to receive the vi&s;its of her &s;i&s;ter, or any other relations, friends, or acquaintance. This u&s;age, &s;he thought exceed|ing barbarous, and it grieved her the more ex|ce&s;&s;ively, &s;ince &s;he married him only becau&s;e &s;he imagined he loved and doated on her to di&s;traction; for as his per&s;on was but ordinary, and his age di&s;proportioned, being twenty-years older than &s;he, it could not be imagined that &s;he was in love with him.&mdash;She was very unea&s;y at being kept a pri&s;oner; but her hu&s;band's fondne&s;s and jealou&s;y was made the pretence. She always loved reading, to which &s;he was now more than ever obliged, as &s;o much time lay upon her hands: Soon after &s;he proved with child, and &s;o perpetually ill, that &s;he implored her hu&s;band to let her enjoy the company of her &s;i&s;ter and friends. When he could have no relief from her importunity (being a&s;&s;ured that in &s;eeing her re|lations, &s;he mu&s;t di&s;cover his barbarous deceit) he thought it was be&s;t to be him&s;elf the relator of his villany; he fell upon his knees before her, with &s;o much &s;eeming confu&s;ion, di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h, that &s;he was at a lo&s;s to know what could mould his &s;tub|born heart to &s;uch contrition. At la&s;t, with a thou&s;and
<PB N="8" REF="11">
well counterfeited tears, and &s;ighs, he &s;tabb'd her with the wounding relation of his wife's being &s;till alive; and with a hypocrite's pangs conjured her to have &s;ome mercy on a lo&s;t man as he was, in an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n&s;tinate, inv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nterate pa&s;&s;ion, that had no alternative b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nt death, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He urged, that could he have &s;upported the pain of living without her, he never would have made him&s;elf &s;o great a villain; but when the ab|&s;olate qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n&s;tion was, whether he &s;hould de&s;troy him|&s;elf, or betray her, &s;elf-love had turned the bal|lance, though not without that angui&s;h to his &s;oul, which had poi&s;oned all his delights, and planted dag|gers to &s;tab his peace. That he had a thou&s;and times &s;tarted in his &s;leep with guilty apprehen&s;ions; the form of her honoured father perpetually haunting his troubled dreams, reproaching him as a traitor to that tru&s;t which in his departing moments he had repo&s;ed in him; repre&s;enting to his tortured imagi|nation the care he took of his education, more like a father than an uncle, with which he had rewarded him by effecting the perdition of his favourite daughter, who was the lovely image of his bene|factor.</P>
<P>With this artful contrition he endeavoured to &s;ooth his injured wife: But what &s;oothing could heal the wounds &s;he had received? Horror! amazement! &s;en&s;e of honour lo&s;t! the world's opi|nion! ten thou&s;and di&s;tre&s;&s;es crowded her di&s;tracted imagination, and &s;he ca&s;t looks upon the con&s;cious traitor with horrible di&s;may! Her fortune was in his hands, the greate&s;t part of which was already lavi&s;hed away in the exce&s;&s;es of drinking and gam|ing. She was young, unacquainted with the world; had never experienced nece&s;&s;ity, and knew no arts of redre&s;&s;ing it; &s;o that thus forlorn and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, to whom could &s;he run for refuge, even from want, and mi&s;ery, but to the very traitor that had undone her. She was acquainted with none that could or
<PB N="9" REF="12">
would e&s;pou&s;e her cau&s;e, a helple&s;s, u&s;ele&s;s load of grief and melancholy! with child! di&s;graced! her own relations either unable, or unwilling to relieve her.</P>
<P>Thus was &s;he detained by unhappy circum&s;tances, and his prevailing arts to wear away three wretch|ed years with him, in the &s;ame hou&s;e, though &s;he mo&s;t &s;olemnly prote&s;ts, and &s;he has a right to be believed, that no per&s;ua&s;ion could ever again reconcile her to his impious arms. Whenever &s;he ca&s;t her eyes upon her &s;on, it gave a mortal wound to her peace: The circum&s;tances of his birth glared full on her imagination; &s;he &s;aw him, in future, upbraided with his father's trea|chery, and his mother's misfortunes. Thus for|&s;aken of all the world, in the very morning of her life, when all things &s;hould have been gay, and promi&s;ing, &s;he wore away three wretched years. Mean time her betrayer had procured for him&s;elf a con&s;iderable employment; the duties of which obliged him to go into the country where his fir&s;t wife lived. He took leave of his injured innocent, with much &s;eeming tenderne&s;s; and made the mo&s;t &s;acred prote&s;tations, that he would not &s;uffer her, nor her child ever to want.</P>
<P>He endeavoured to per&s;uade her to accompany him into the country, and to &s;educe, and quiet her con&s;cience, &s;hewed her a celebrated piece written in defence of Polygamy, and Concubinage: When he was gone, he &s;oon relap&s;ed into his former extravagancies, forgot his promi&s;e of providing for his child, and its mother; and inhumanly left them a prey to indigence and oppre&s;&s;ion. The lady was only happy in being relea&s;ed from the killing angui&s;h, of every day having before her eyes the object of her undoing.</P>
<P>When &s;he again came abroad into the world, &s;he was looked upon with cold indifference; that which had been her greate&s;t misfortune, was imputed
<PB N="10" REF="13">
to her as the mo&s;t enormous guilt; and &s;he was every where &s;neered at, avoided, and de&s;pi&s;ed. What pity is it, that an unfortunate, as well as a fal&s;e &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\np, &s;hould damn a woman's fame! In what re&s;pect was Mrs. Manley to blame? In what particular was &s;he guilty? to marry her cou&s;in, who pa&s;&s;ionately profe&s;&s;ed love to her, and who &s;o|lemnly vowed him&s;elf a widower, could not be guilt; on the other hand, it had prudence and gra|titude for its ba&s;is. Her continuing in the hou&s;e with him after he had made the di&s;covery, cannot be guilt, for by doing &s;o, &s;he was prevented from being expo&s;ed to &s;uch nece&s;&s;ities as perhaps would have produced greater ruin. When want and beggary &s;tare a woman in the face, e&s;pecially one accu&s;tomed to the delicacies of life, then indeed is virtue in danger; and they who e&s;cape mu&s;t have more than human a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Our poete&s;s now perceived, that together with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\neputation, &s;he had lo&s;t all the e&s;teem, that her conver&s;ation and abilities might have el&s;e procured her; and &s;he was reduced to the de|plorable nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;ociating with tho&s;e who&s;e fame was bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">\ned by their indi&s;cretion, becau&s;e the more &s;ober and virtuous part of the &s;ex did not care to ri&s;k their own characters, by being in company with one &s;o much &s;u&s;pected, and again&s;t whom the appearance of guilt was too &s;trong.</P>
<P>Under this dilemma, it is difficult to point out any method of behaviour, by which &s;he would not be expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure: If &s;he had &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in &s;olitude, the ill-natured world would have imputed to it a cau&s;e, which is not founded on virtue; be&s;ides, as the means of &s;upport were now removed, by the perfidy of Mr. Manley, &s;he mu&s;t have peri&s;hed by this re&s;olution.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, the reader will not be much &s;ur|prized to find our authore&s;s, under the patronage of the duche&s;s of Cleveland, a mi&s;tre&s;s of king
<PB N="11" REF="14">
Charles the IId's, who was ju&s;tly reckoned one of the mo&s;t celebrated beauties of that age. Mrs. Manley was paying a vi&s;it to a lady of her grace's ac|quaintance, when &s;he was introduced into the favour of this royal courtezan; and as the duche&s;s of Cleveland was a woman of parts and genius, &s;he could not but be charmed with the &s;prightli|ne&s;s of her conver&s;ation. She was fond of new faces, and immediately contracted the greate&s;t inti|macy with our poete&s;s, and gave her a general in|vitation to her table. The lady at who&s;e hou&s;e the duche&s;s became acquainted with Mrs. Manley, &s;oon perceived her indi&s;cretion in bringing them together; for the love of novelty &s;o far prevailed on the duche&s;s, that her&s;elf was immediately di&s;carded, and the affection formerly be&s;towed upon her, was lavi&s;hed on Mrs. Manley.</P>
<P>This procured our poete&s;s an inveterate enemy; and the greate&s;t blow that was ever &s;truck at her reputation, was by that woman, who had been be|fore her friend. She was not content to inform per&s;ons who began to know and e&s;teem Mrs. Manley, that her marriage was a cheat; but even endeavour|ed to make the duche&s;s jealous of her new favourite's charms, in re&s;pect of Mr. Goodman the player, who at that time had the honour of approaching her grace's per&s;on, with the freedom of a gallant.</P>
<P>As the duche&s;s of Cleveland was a woman of a ve|ry fickle temper, in &s;ix months time &s;he began to be tired of Mrs. Manley.

A woman of this temper will be at no lo&s;s for the means of effecting any one's ruin, and having now conceived an aver&s;ion to our poete&s;s, &s;he was re&s;olved to drive her from her hou&s;e, with as much reproach as po&s;&s;ible; and accordingly gave out, that &s;he had detected Mrs. Manley in an intrigue with her own &s;on, and as &s;he did not care to give encouragement to &s;uch amours, &s;he thought pro|per to di&s;charge her. Whether or not there was any truth in this charge, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to determine: But if Mrs. Manley's own word may be taken. in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;he was perfectly inno|cent thereof.</P>
<P>When our authore&s;s was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the duche&s;s, &s;he was &s;ollicited by lieutenant-general Tidcomb, to pa&s;s &s;ome time with him at his country &s;eat; but &s;he excu&s;ed her&s;elf by telling him, &s;he mu&s;t be in love with a man, before &s;he could think of re&s;iding with him, which &s;he could not, without a violation of truth, profe&s;s for him. She told him her love of &s;olitude was improved, by her di&s;gu&s;t of the world, and &s;ince it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nublic with reputation, &s;he was re&s;olved to re|main in it concealed.</P>
<P>It was in this &s;olitude &s;he compo&s;ed her fir&s;t tra|gedy, which was much more famous for the lan|guage, fire, and tenderne&s;s, than the conduct. Mrs. Barry di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf in it, and the author was often heard to expre&s;s great &s;urprize, that a man of Mr. Betterton's grave &s;en&s;e, and judgment, &s;hould think well enough of the productions of a young woman, to bring it upon the &s;tage, &s;ince &s;he her&s;elf in a more mature age could hardly bear to read it. But as the play &s;ucceeded, &s;he received &s;uch unbounded incen&s;e from admirers, that her apartment was crowded with men of wit, and gaiety. There is a copy of ver&s;es prefixed to her play, &s;aid to be written by a very great hand which de&s;erve notice.<Q><PB N="13" REF="16"><L>What! all our &s;ex in one &s;ad hour undone?</L>

<P>They who had a regard for Mrs. Manley could not but ob&s;erve with concern, that her conduct was &s;uch, as would &s;oon i&s;&s;ue in her ruin. No language but flat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nery approached her ear; the Beaux told her, that a woman of her wit, was not to be con|fined to the dull formalities of her own &s;ex, but had a right to a&s;&s;ume the unre&s;erved freedom of the male, &s;ince all things were pardonable to a la|dy, who knew to give laws to others, yet was not obliged to keep them her&s;elf General Tid|comb, who &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nms to have been her &s;inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nre&s;t friend, took the privilege of an old acquaincance to cor|rect her ill ta&s;te, and the wrong turn &s;he gave her judgment, in admitting adulation from &s;uch wretches,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
who&s;e prai&s;e could reflect but little honour, and who would be ready to boa&s;t of favours they never received, nor indeed ever endeavoured to obtain.</P>
<P>This &s;alutary council was rejected, &s;he told him, that &s;he did not think fit to reform a conduct, which &s;he reckoned very innocent; and &s;till con|tinued to receive the whi&s;pers of flatterers, 'till experience taught her the folly of her behaviour, and &s;he lived to repent her indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Her virtue was now nodding, and &s;he was ready to fall into the arms of any gallant, like mellow fruit, without much trouble in the gathering. Sir Thomas Skipwith, a character of gaiety of tho&s;e times, and, who it &s;eems had theatrical connections, was recommended to her, as being very able to promote her de&s;ign in writing for the &s;tage. This knight was in the 50th year of his age, and in the 60th of his con&s;titution, when he was fir&s;t in|troduced to her, and as he had been a long practi&s;ed gallant, he &s;oon made addre&s;&s;es to her, and whether or no this knight, who was more dangerous to a wo|man's reputation, than her virtue, was favoured by her, the world was &s;o much convinced of it, that her character was now ab&s;olutely lo&s;t. Sir Thomas was a weak, vain, conceited coxcomb, who de|lighted in boa&s;ting of his conque&s;ts over women, and what was often owing to his fortune, and &s;ta|tion in life, he imputed to his addre&s;s, and the ele|gance of his manner, of both which he was to|tally de&s;titute. He even publi&s;hed Mrs. Manley's di&s;|honour, and from that time our &s;prightly poete&s;s was con&s;idered, by the &s;ober part of the &s;ex, quite abandoned to all &s;hame.</P>
<P>When her affair with this &s;uperannuated knight was over, &s;he &s;oon engaged in another intrigue, &s;till more prejudicial to her character; for it was with a married man, one Mr. Tilly, a gentleman of the Law; with whom &s;he lived a con&s;iderable time: while he underwent at home many of tho&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="18">
fevere lectures, which the ju&s;t provocation, and jealou&s;y of his wife taught her to read him. Mrs. Tilly at la&s;t died, and our gallant was left at his freedom to marry the object of his pa&s;&s;ion; but unluckily his finances were in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that he was obliged to repair them by marrying a wo|man of fortune. This was a cruel circum&s;tance; for he really loved, and doated upon Mrs. Manley, and had the felicity of a reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion. She agreed however, in order to repair his fortune, that he &s;hould marry a rich young widow, whom he &s;oon won by the elegance of his addre&s;s, while our authore&s;s retired into the country to &s;pend her days in &s;olitude and &s;orrow, and bid an everla&s;ting farewel to the plea&s;ures of love and gallantry. Mr. Tilly did not many years &s;urvive this &s;eparation: his life was rendered mi&s;erable at home by the jea|lou&s;y of his young wife, who had heard of his affair with Mrs. Manley; he lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and died in a deplorable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>During her retirement, our authore&s;s, who had a mo&s;t confirmed aver&s;ion to the Whig mini|&s;try, wrote her Atalantis, which was meant as a repre&s;entation of the characters of &s;ome of tho&s;e, who had effected the Revolution. A warrant was granted from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate's office, to &s;eize the Printer and Publi&s;her of the&s;e volumes. This circum&s;tance reduced the writer to a very trou|ble&s;ome dilemma; &s;he could not bear the thoughts that innocent people &s;hould &s;uffer on her account, and &s;he judged it cruel to remain concealed, while they, who were only inferior in&s;truments, were &s;uffering for her. She con&s;ulted, on this occa&s;ion, her be&s;t friend, general Tidcomb, who, after ral|lying her for expo&s;ing people, who had never in particular injured her, he advi&s;ed her to go into France, and made her an offer of his pur&s;e for that purpo&s;e. This advice &s;he rejected, and came to a determined re&s;olution, that no per&s;on &s;hould
<PB N="16" REF="19">
ever &s;uffer on her account. The general a&s;ked her, how &s;he &s;hould like to be confined in New|gate? to which &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he would ra|ther lye in a pri&s;on, after having di&s;charged her con&s;cience, than riot in a palace under its re|proaches. The general upon this replied, that the&s;e things &s;ounded very heroic, but there was a great difference between real and imaginary &s;uf|ferings, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that &s;he had cho&s;en to declare her&s;elf for the Tories, a party, who never could keep their own, nor other people's &s;ecrets, and were ever forgetful of &s;uch as &s;erved them; that the mo&s;t &s;evere critics upon the Tory writings, were the Tories them&s;elves, who never con&s;idering the de|&s;ign, or hone&s;t intention of the author, would examine the performance only, and that too with as much &s;everity, as they would an enemy's, and at the &s;ame time value them&s;elves upon being im|partial again&s;t their friends. Then as to grati|tude, or genero&s;ity, the Tories did not approach to the Whigs, who never &s;uffered any man to go unrewarded, however dull, or in&s;ignificant, provided he declared him&s;elf to be for them; whereas the Tories had no general intere&s;t, and con&s;equently no particular, each per&s;on refu&s;ing to contribute towards the benefit of the whole; and if it &s;hould happen, that &s;he &s;hould peri&s;h, through want, in a Jail, they would &s;ooner con|demn her folly, than pity her &s;ufferings.'</Q></P>
<P>This did not deter our poete&s;s from voluntarily pre&s;enting her&s;elf before the Court of King's-Bench, as the author of the Atalantis.</P>
<P>When &s;he was examined before the &s;ecretary (then lord Sunderland) he was a&s;&s;iduous to know from whom &s;he had got information of &s;ome parti|culars, which they imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nned were above her own intelligence.

<P>In con&s;equence of this examination, our autho|re&s;s was clo&s;e &s;hut up in a me&s;&s;enger's hou&s;e, without being allowed pen, ink, and paper. How|ever her council &s;ued out her Habeas Corpus at the King's-Bench Bar, and &s;he was admitted to bail.</P>
<P>Whether tho&s;e in power were a&s;hamed to bring a woman to her trial, for writing a few amorous trifles, or our laws were defective, as was generally conjectured, becau&s;e &s;he had di&s;gui&s;ed her &s;atire under romantic names, and a feigned &s;cene of action, &s;he was di&s;charged, after &s;everal times expo&s;ing her in per&s;on, to cro&s;s the court before the Bench of Judges, with her three attendants, the Printer, and two Publi&s;hers.</P>
<P>Not long after this a total change of the mi|ni&s;try en&s;ued, the &s;tate&s;men to whom &s;he had been obnoxious were removed, and con&s;equently all her fears upon that &s;core di&s;&s;ipated; her native gaiety, and good humour returned, and &s;he again employed her&s;elf in writing a tragedy for the &s;tage, and re&s;olved never more to deal in politics, as being much out of the natural &s;phere of a wo|man: &s;he was per&s;uaded it was folly in one in her &s;tation, to di&s;oblige any party by a pen equally qualified to divert all.</P>

Being advanced to the autumn of her charms, &s;he conver&s;ed with the oppo&s;ite &s;ex, in a manner very delicate, &s;en&s;ible, and agreeable, and when &s;he felt that time had left his impre&s;&s;ion upon her brow, &s;he did not court prai&s;e and flattery. The greate&s;t genius's of the times conver&s;ed freely with her, and gave her daily proofs of e&s;teem, and friend&s;hip, except Sir Richard Steele, with whom it &s;eems &s;he was at variance; and indeed Sir Ri|chard &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed him&s;elf by his manner of taking revenge; for he publi&s;hed to the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nld that it was his own fault he was not happy with Mrs. Manley, for which omi&s;&s;ion he publickly, and gravely a&s;ked her pardon.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t material incidents in the life of our poete&s;s; a lady, who was born with high powers from nature, which were afterwards culti|vated by enjoying the brighte&s;t conver&s;ation; the early part of her life was unfortunate, &s;he fell a &s;acrifice to a &s;educer, who laid the &s;oundation for tho&s;e errors &s;he afterwards committed, and of tho&s;e &s;ufferings &s;he underwent; &s;he had a high reli&s;h for the plea&s;ures of life; &s;he was extremely &s;u&s;cepti|ble of the pa&s;&s;ion of love, and treated it with a peculiar vivacity.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN HUGHES.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM Duncomb, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> has obliged the world with an entire edition of this author's poetical and pro&s;e works, to which he has prefixed &s;ome account of his life, written with can|dour and &s;pirit. Upon his authority we chiefly build the following narration; in which we &s;hall endeavour to do as much ju&s;tice as po&s;&s;ible to the memory of this excellent poet.</P>
<P>Our author was the &s;on of a worthy citizen of London, and born at Marlborough in the county of Wilts, on the 29th of January 1677; but received the rudiments of his learning at private &s;chools in London.</P>
<P>In the earlie&s;t years of his youth, he applied him|&s;elf with ardour to the pur&s;uit of the &s;i&s;ter arts, poetry, drawing and mu&s;ic, in each of which by turns, he made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s; but for the mo&s;t part pur&s;ued the&s;e and other polite &s;tudies, only as agreeable amu&s;ements, under frequent con|finement
<PB N="28" REF="31">
from indi&s;po&s;ition, and a valetudinary &s;tate of health. He had &s;ome time an employment in the office of ordinance; and was &s;ecretary to two or three commi&s;&s;ioners under the great-&s;eal, for purcha&s;ing lands for the better &s;ecuring the docks and harbours at Port&s;mouth, Chatham, and Harwich.</P>
<P>In the year 1717 the lord chancellor Cowper, (to whom Mr. Hughes was then but lately known) was plea&s;ed, without any previous &s;ollicitation, to make him his &s;ecretary for the commi&s;&s;ions of the peace, and to di&s;tingui&s;h him with &s;ingular marks of his favour and affection: And upon his lord&s;hip's laying down the great-&s;eal, he was at his particular re|commendation, and with the ready concurrence of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, continued in the &s;ame employment under the earl of Macclesfield.</P>
<P>He held this place to the time of his decea&s;e, which happened on the 17th of February 1719, the very night in which his tragedy, entitled the Siege of Dama&s;cus, was fir&s;t acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane.</P>
<P>He was cut off by a con&s;umption, after a painful life, at the age of 42, when he had ju&s;t arrived at an agreeable competence, and advancing in fame and fortune. So ju&s;t is the beautiful re|flexion of Milton in his Lycidas;<Q><L>Fame is the &s;pur, that the clear &s;pirit doth rai&s;e,</L>
<L>(That la&s;t infirmity of noble mind)</L>
<L>To &s;corn delights, and live laborious days;</L>
<L>But the fair guerdon, when we hope to find,</L>
<L>And think to bur&s;t out into &s;udden blaze,</L>
<L>Comes the blind fury with th' abhorred &s;hears,</L>
<L>And &s;lits the thin-&s;pun life.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>He was privately buried in the vault under the chancel of St. Andrew's Church in Holborn.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32">
Mr. Hughes, as a te&s;timony of gratitude to his noble friend, and generous patron, earl Cowper, gave his lord&s;hip a few weeks before he died, his picture drawn by Sir Godfrey Kneller, which he him&s;elf had received from that ma&s;terly painter. The value lord Cowper &s;et upon it will be be&s;t &s;hewn, by the letter he wrote upon this occa&s;ion to Mr. Hughes. As &s;uch a te&s;timony from &s;o eminent a per&s;on, was con&s;idered by him&s;elf as one of the highe&s;t honours he was capable of re|ceiving, we &s;hall therefore in&s;ert it.<LETTER>

<P>Mr. Hughes was happy in the acquaintance and friend&s;hip of &s;everal of the greate&s;t men, and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed genius's of the age in which he lived; particularly of the nobleman ju&s;t now mentioned, the pre&s;ent lord bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, lord chief baron Gilbert, Sir Godfrey Kneller, Mr. Congreve, Mr. Addi&s;on, Sir Richard Steele, Mr. Southern, Mr. Rowe, &amp;c. and might have ju&s;tly boa&s;ted in the words of Horace <Q><L>&mdash;me</L><L>Cum magnis vixi&s;&s;e, invita fatebitu u&s;que</L><L>Invidia.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="33">
Having given this &s;hort account of his life, which perhaps is all that is pre&s;erved any where concerning him; we &s;hall now con&s;ider him, fir&s;t, as a poet, and then as a pro&s;e writer.</P>
<P>The Triumph of Peace was the earlie&s;t poem he wrote of any length, that appeared in public. It was written on occa&s;ion of the peace of Ry&s;wick, and printed in the year 1677. A learned gentleman at Cambridge, in a letter to a friend of Mr. Hughes's, dated the 28th of February 1697-8, gives the fol|lowing account of the favourable reception this poem met with there, upon its fir&s;t publication. I think I never heard a poem read with &s;o much admiration, as the Triumph of Peace was by our be&s;t critics here; nor a greater character given to a young poet, at his fir&s;t appearing; no, not even to Mr. Congreve him&s;elf. So nobly elevated are his thoughts, his numbers &s;o harmonious, and his turns &s;o fine and delicate, that we cry out with Tully, on a like occa&s;ion, <Q>' No&s;trae &s;pes altera Romae!</Q></P>
<P>The Court of Neptune, was written on king William's return from Holland, two years after the peace, in 1699. This Poem was admired for the ver&s;ification, however, the mu&s;ical flow of the numbers is its lea&s;t prai&s;e; it rather de&s;erves to be valued for the propriety, and boldne&s;s of the figures and metaphors, and the machinery.</P>
<P>The following lines have been ju&s;tly quoted as an in&s;tance of the author's happy choice of metaphors.<Q><L>As when the golden god, who rules the day,</L>
<L>Drives down his flaming chariot to the &s;ea,</L>
<L>And leaves the nations here, involved in night,</L>
<L>To di&s;tant regions he tran&s;ports his light;</L>
<L>So William's rays by turns, two nations cheer,</L>
<L>And when he &s;ets to them, he ri&s;es here.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34">
A friend of Mr. Hughes's &s;oon after the publica|tion of this poem, complimented him upon the choice of his &s;ubject, and for the moral &s;entiments contained in it. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am &s;ure (&s;ays he) virtue is mo&s;t for the intere&s;t of mankind; and tho&s;e poets have ever obtained the mo&s;t honour in the world, who have made that the end and de&s;ign of their works. A wanton Sappho, or Anacreon, among the ancients, never had the &s;ame applau&s;e, as a Pindar, or Alexis; nor in the judgment of Horace did they de&s;erve it. In the opinion of all po&s;terity, a lewd and debauch'd Ovid, did ju&s;tly &s;ubmit to the worth of a Virgil; and, in future ages, a Dryden will never be compared to Milton. In all times, and in all places of the world, the moral poets have been ever the greate&s;t; and as much &s;uperior to others in wit, as in virtue. Nor does this &s;eem difficult to be accounted for, &s;ince the dignity of their &s;ubjects naturally rai&s;ed their ideas, and gave a grandeur to their &s;entiments.'</Q></P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au, a Pindaric Ode (printed in 1702) was occa&s;ioned by the death of king William. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In Pindaric and Lyric Poetry (&s;ays Mr. Duncomb) our author's genius &s;hines in its full lu&s;tre. Tho' he enjoyed all that fire of ima|gination, and divine enthu&s;ia&s;m, for which &s;ome of the ancient poets are &s;o de&s;ervedly admired, yet did his fancy never run away with his rea&s;on, but was always guided by &s;uperior judgment; and the mu&s;ic of his ver&s;e is exqui&s;ite.'</Q></P>
<P>The Tran&s;lation of the third Ode of the third Book of Horace, and the Paraphra&s;e of the twenty|&s;econd Ode, of the fir&s;t book, were both written when he was very young; and the latter of them was his fir&s;t poetical E&s;&s;ay, which appeared in print. Mr. Hughes, in a private letter &s;ent to one of his friends, gives it as his opinion, that the Odes of
<PB N="32" REF="35">
Horace, are fitter to be paraphra&s;ed, than tran&s;|lated.</P>
<P>The Tenth Book of Lucan, was tran&s;lated by Mr. Hughes, long before Mr. Rowe undertook that author. The occa&s;ion of it was this: Mr. Ton&s;on the book&s;eller, &s;ollicited a tran&s;lation of Lucan, by &s;everal hands. Mr. Hughes performed his part, but others failing in their promi&s;es, the de&s;ign was dropp'd; and Mr. Rowe was afterwards prevailed upon to undertake the whole, which he performed with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In the year 1709 Mr. Hughes obliged the pub|lick, with an elegant tran&s;lation of Moliere's cele|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nd Comedy, the Mi&s;antrope. This has been &s;ince reprinted, with the other plays of that admirable author, tran&s;lated by Mr. Ozell; but care is taken to di&s;tingui&s;h this particular play.</P>
<P>In the year 1712 his Opera of Calyp&s;o and Telemachus, was performed at the Queen's Theatre in the Hay-Market. Perhaps it may be worth while to mention here, one circum&s;tance concerning this Opera, as it relates to the Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ic in England, and di&s;covers the great partiality &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nwn at that time to Opera's performed in Italian. After many &s;uch had been encouraged by large &s;ub&s;criptions, this, originally written, and &s;et in Engli&s;h, after the Italian manner, was prepared with the u&s;ual expence of &s;cenes and decorations; and being much crowded and applauded at the rehear&s;als, a &s;ub&s;cription was obtained for it as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>This alarmed the whole Italian band, who, ap|prehending that their profe&s;&s;ion would &s;uffer thereby, procured an order from the duke of Shrew&s;bury, then lord chamberlain, the day be|fore the performing of this Opera, to take of the &s;ub&s;cription for it, and to open the hou&s;e at the lowe&s;t prices, or not at all. This was de&s;igned to &s;ink it, but failed of its end. It was per|formed,
<PB N="33" REF="36">
though under &s;uch great di&s;couragement; and was revived afterwards at the theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. Mr. Addi&s;on, in the Spectator, Numb. 405, &s;peaking of the ju&s;t applau&s;e given this opera, by Signior Nicolini (who he &s;ays was the greate&s;t performer in dramatic mu&s;ic, that perhaps ever ap|peared upon a &s;tage) has the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'The town is highly obliged to that excellent ar|ti&s;t, for having &s;hewn us the Italian mu&s;ic in its per|fection, as well as for that generous approbation he gave to an Opera of our own country, in which Mr. Galliard the compo&s;er endeavoured to do ju&s;tice to the beauty of the words, by following that noble example which has been &s;et him by the greate&s;t foreign ma&s;ters of that art.'</P></Q></P>
<P>The Ode to the Creator of the World, occa&s;ioned by the fragments of Orpheus, was printed in the year 1713, at the particular in&s;tance of Mr. Addi&s;on; and is mentioned with applau&s;e in the Spectator. This, and the Exta&s;y, (publi&s;hed &s;ince the death of the author) are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed two of the noble&s;t Odes in our language. The &s;eventh Stanza of the la&s;t mentioned piece, is &s;o &s;ublimely excellent, that it would be denying our&s;elves, and our poetical readers, a plea&s;ure not to tran&s;cribe it. The whole of this Ode is beautifully heightened, and poetically conceived. It furni&s;hed a hint to a living Poet to write what he entitles the Excur&s;ion, which tho' it has very great merit, yet falls infinitely &s;hort of this animated Ode of Mr. Hughes.</P>

<P>The author of an E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m, printed in the year 1728, informs us, that the Tragedy of Cato being brought upon the &s;tage in 1713 was owing to Mr. Hughes. The circum&s;tances recorded
<PB N="35" REF="38">
by this author are &s;o remarkable, that they de&s;erve to be related; and as they &s;erve to &s;hew the high opinion Mr. Addi&s;on entertained of our author's abilities as a Poet, I &s;hall therefore tran&s;cribe his own words.&mdash; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'It has been often &s;aid by good judges, that Cato was no proper &s;ubject for a dramatic poem: That the character of a &s;toic philo&s;opher, is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the hurry and tumult of action, and pa&s;&s;ions which are the &s;oul of tragedy. That the ingenious author mi&s;carried in the plan of his work, but &s;upported it by the dignity, the purity, the beauty, and ju&s;tne&s;s of the &s;entiments. This was &s;o much the opinion of Mr. Maynwaring, who was generally allowed to be the be&s;t critic of our time; that he was again&s;t bringing the play upon the &s;tage, and it lay by unfini&s;hed many years. That it was play'd at la&s;t was owing to Mr. Hughes. He had read the four acts which were fini&s;hed, and really thought it would be of &s;ervice to the public, to have it repre&s;ented at the latter end of queen Anne's reign, when the &s;pirit of liberty was likely to be lo&s;t. He en|deavoured to bring Mr. Addi&s;on into his opinion, which he did, and con&s;ented it &s;hould be acted if Mr. Hughes would write the la&s;t act; and he offered him the &s;cenery for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, excu|&s;ing his not fini&s;hing it him&s;elf, upon account of &s;ome other avocations. He pre&s;s'd Mr. Hughes to do it &s;o earne&s;tly, that he was prevailed upon, and &s;et about it. But, a week after, &s;eeing Mr. Addi&s;on again, with an intention to communi|cate to him what he thought of it, he was agreeably &s;urprized at his producing &s;ome papers, where near half of the act was written by the author him&s;elf, who took fire at the hint, that it would be &s;erviceable; and, upon a &s;econd re|flexion, went through with the fifth act, not that
<PB N="36" REF="39">
he was diffident of Mr. Hughes's abilities; but knowing that no man could have &s;o perfect a notion of his de&s;ign as him&s;elf, who had been &s;o long. and &s;o carefully thinking of it. I was told this by Mr. Hughes, and I tell it to &s;hew, that it was not for the love-&s;cenes, that Mr. Addi&s;on con&s;ented to have his Tragedy acted, but to &s;upport public &s;pirit; which in the opi|nion of the author was then declining.'</P></Q></P>
<P>In the year 1720 the Siege of Dama&s;cus was acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, with univer&s;al applau&s;e. His pre&s;ent maje&s;ty honoured it with his pre&s;ence, and the late queen di&s;tingui&s;h|ed it with marks of favour.</P>
<P>Mr. Hughes drew up the dedication of this Tragedy to the late Earl Cowper, about ten days before he died. It is indeed &s;urpri&s;ing, that he &s;hould be able to form a piece &s;o finely turned, and at &s;uch an hour; when death was ju&s;t before him, and he was too weak to tran&s;cribe it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr Pope, in a letter to Mr. Hughes's brother, written &s;oon after his death, in an&s;wer to one re|ceived from him, with the printed copy of the play, has the following pathetic pa&s;&s;age. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'I read over again your brother's play, with more concern and &s;orrow, than I ever felt in the reading any Tragedy. The real lo&s;s of a good man may be called a di&s;tre&s;s to the world, and ought to affect us more, than any feigned di&s;tre&s;s, how well drawn &s;oever. I am glad of an occa&s;ion of giving you under my hand this te&s;timony, both how excellent I think this work to be, and how excellent I thought the author.'</P></Q></P>
<P>It is generally allowed that the characters in this play are finely varied and di&s;tingui&s;hed; that the &s;entiments are ju&s;t, and well adapted to the cha|racters; that it abounds with beautiful de&s;crip|tions,
<PB N="37" REF="40">
apt allu&s;ions to the manners, and opinions of the times where the &s;cene is laid, and with noble morals; that the diction is pure, unaffected, and &s;ublime; and that the plot is conducted in a &s;im|ple and clear manner.</P>
<P>Some critics have objected, that there is not a &s;ufficient ground and foundation, for the di&s;tre&s;s in the fourth and fifth acts. That Phocyas only a&s;&s;i&s;ts the enemy to take Dama&s;cus a few days &s;ooner, than it mu&s;t unavoidably have fallen into the hands of the Saracens by a capitulation, which was far from di&s;honourable. If Phocyas is guilty, his guilt mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in this only, that he performed the &s;ame action from a &s;en&s;e of his own wrong, and to pre&s;erve the idol of his &s;oul from violation, and death, which he might have performed lauda|bly, upon better principles. But this (&s;ay they) &s;eems not &s;ufficient ground for tho&s;e &s;trong and &s;tinging reproaches he ca&s;ts upon him&s;elf, nor for Eudocia's rejecting him with &s;o much &s;everity. It would have been a better ground of di&s;tre&s;s, con|&s;idering the frailty of human nature, and the vio|lent temptations he lay under; if he had been at la&s;t prevailed upon to profe&s;s him&s;elf a Mahome|tan: For then his remor&s;e, and &s;elf-condemnation, would have been natural, his puni&s;hment ju&s;t, and the character of Eudocia placed in a more amiable light. In an&s;wer to the&s;e objections, and in order to do ju&s;tice to the judgment of Mr. Hughes, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that he formed his play according to the plan here recommended: but, over-per&s;uaded by &s;ome friends, he altered it as it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>When our author was but in the nineteenth year of his age, he wrote a Tragedy, entitled, Amala&s;ont Queen of the Goths, which di&s;plays a fertile genius, and a ma&s;terly invention. Be&s;ides the&s;e poetical productions Mr. Hughes is author of &s;everal works in pro&s;e, particularly,</P>

<HEAD>MATTHEW PRIOR, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS celebrated poet was the &s;on of Mr. George Prior, citizen of London, who was by profe&s;&s;ion a Joiner. Our author was born in 1664. His father dying when he was very young, left him to the care of an uncle, a Vintner near Charing-Cro&s;s, who di&s;charged the tru&s;t that was repo&s;ed in him, with a tenderne&s;s truly pa|ternal, as Mr. Prior always acknowledged with the highe&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude. He received part of his education at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf to great advantage, but was afterwards taken home by his uncle in order to be bred up to his trade. Notwith&s;tanding this mean employment, to which Mr. Prior &s;eemed now doomed, yet at his lei&s;ure hours he pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudy of the cla&s;&s;ics, and e&s;pecially his favourite Horace, by which means he was &s;oon taken notice of, by the polite company, who re&s;orted to his uncle's hou&s;e. It happened one day, that the earl of Dor&s;et being at his Tavern, which he often fre|quented with &s;everal gentlemen of rank, the di&s;|cour&s;e turned upon the Odes of Horace; and the company being divided in their &s;entiments a|bout a pa&s;&s;age in that poet, one of the gentlemen &s;aid, I find we are not like to agree in our criti|ci&s;ms, but, if I am not mi&s;taken, there is a young
<PB N="44" REF="47">
fellow in the hou&s;e, who is able to &s;et us all right: upon which he named Prior, who was immediately &s;ent for, and de&s;ired to give his opi|nion of Horace's meaning in the Ode under con|&s;ideration; this he did with great mode&s;ty, and &s;o much to the &s;atisfaction of the company, that the earl of Dor&s;et, from that moment, determined to remove him from the &s;tation in which he was, to one more &s;uited to his genius; and according|ly procured him to be &s;ent to St. John's College in Cambridge, where he took his degree in 1686, and afterwards became fellow of the College.</P>
<P>During his re&s;idence in the univer&s;ity, he con|tracted an intimate friend&s;hip with Charles Monta|gue, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> afterwards earl of Hallifax, in conjunc|tion with whom he wrote a very humorous piece, entitled The Hind and Panther tran&s;ver&s;ed to the &s;tory of the Country Mou&s;e, and the City Mou&s;e, printed 1687 in 4to. in an&s;wer to Mr. Dryden's Hind and the Panther, publi&s;hed the year before.</P>
<P>Upon the revolution Mr. Prior was brought to court by his great patron the earl of Dor&s;et, by who&s;e intere&s;t he was introduced to public em|ployment, and in the year 1690 was made &s;e|cretary to the earl of Berkley, plenipot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nntiary to King William and Queen Mary at the Congre&s;s at the Hague.</P>
<P>In this &s;tation he acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well, that he was afterwards appointed &s;ecretary to the earls of Pembroke, and Jer&s;ey, and Sir Jo&s;eph William|&s;on, amba&s;&s;adors, and plenipotentiaries, at the treaty of Ry&s;wick 1697, as he was likewi&s;e in 1698 to the earl of Portland, amba&s;&s;ador to the court of France. While he was in that kingdom, one of the officers of the French King's hou&s;hold, &s;hew|ing him the royal apartments, and curio&s;ities at
<PB N="45" REF="48">
Ver&s;ailles, e&s;pecially the paintings of Le Brun, wherein the victories of Lewis XIV. are de&s;crib|ed, a&s;ked him, whether King William's actions are to be &s;een in his palace? <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No Sir, replied Mr. Prior, the monuments of my ma&s;ter's actions are to be &s;een every where, but in his own hou&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1697 Mr. Prior was made &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate for Ireland, and in 1700 was cre|ated ma&s;ter of arts by Mandamus, and appointed one of the lords commi&s;&s;ioners of trade and plan|ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nions, upon the re&s;ignation of Mr. Locke. He was al&s;o Member of Parliament for Ea&s;t-Grin&s;tead in Su&s;&s;ex. In 1710 he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have had a &s;hare in writing the Examiner, and particularly a Critici&s;m in it upon a Poem of Dr. Garth to the earl of Godolphin, taken notice of in the life of Garth.</P>
<P>About this time, when Godolphin was defeat|ed by Oxford, and the Tories who had long been eclip&s;ed by the lu&s;tre of Marlborough, began again to hold up their heads, Mr. Prior and Dr. Garth e&s;pou&s;ed oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts; Mr. Prior wrote for, and Garth again&s;t the court. The Dr. was &s;o far hone&s;t, that he did not de&s;ert his patron in di&s;tre&s;s; and notwith&s;tanding the cloud which then hung upon the party, he addre&s;&s;ed ver&s;es to him, which, however they may fail in the poetry, bear &s;trong the marks of gratitude, and honour.</P>
<P>While Mr. Prio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n was thus very early initi|ated in public bu&s;ine&s;s, and continued in the hur|ry of affairs for many years, it mu&s;t appear not a little &s;urprizing, that he &s;hould find &s;ufficient op|portunities to cultivate his poetical talents, to the amazing heighth he rai&s;ed them. In his preface to his poems, he &s;ays, that poetry was only the product of his lei&s;ure hours; that he had commonly bu&s;ine&s;s enough upon his hands, and, as he mo|de&s;tly
<PB N="46" REF="49">
adds, was only a poet by accident; but we mu&s;t take the liberty of differing from him in the la&s;t particular, for Mr. Prior &s;eems to have received from the mu&s;es, at his nativity, all the graces they could well be&s;tow on their greate&s;t favourite.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not omit one in&s;tance in Mr. Prior's conduct, which will appear very remarkable: he was cho&s;en a member of that Parliament which impeached the Partition Treaty, to which he him|&s;elf had been &s;ecretary; and though his &s;hare in that tran&s;action was con&s;equently very con&s;idera|ble, yet he joined in the impeachment upon an hone&s;t principle of conviction, that exceptionable mea&s;ures attended it.</P>
<P>The lord Bolingbroke, who, notwith&s;tanding ma|ny exceptions made both to his conduct, and &s;enti|ments in other in&s;tances, yet mu&s;t be allowed to be an accompli&s;hed judge of fine talents, entertained the highe&s;t e&s;teem for Mr. Prior, on account of his &s;hining abilities. This noble lord, in a letter dated September 10, 1712, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Prior, while he was the Queen's mini&s;ter, and plenipotentiary at the court of France, pays him the following compliment; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'For God's &s;ake, Matt. hide the nak|edne&s;s of thy country, and give the be&s;t turn thy fertile brain will furni&s;h thee with, to the blunders of thy countrymen, who are not much better politicians, than the French are poets.'</Q> His lord&s;hip thus concludes his epi&s;tle; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It is near three o' clock in the morning, I have been hard at work all day, and am not yet enough reco|vered to bear much fatigue; excu&s;e therefore the confu&s;edne&s;s of this &s;croll, which is only from Harry to Matt, and not from the &s;ecretary to the mini&s;ter.

the morning; believe that no man loves you bet|ter, or is more faithfully yours, &amp;c. BOLINGBROKE.'</Q> </P>
<P>There are &s;everal other letters from Bolingbroke to Prior, which, were it nece&s;&s;ary, we might in&s;ert as evidences of his e&s;teem for him; but Mr. Prior was in every re&s;pect &s;o great a man, that the e&s;teem even of lord Bolingbroke cannot add much to the lu&s;tre of his reputation, both as a &s;tate&s;man, and a poet. Mr. Prior is repre&s;ented by tho&s;e who knew, and have wrote concerning him, as a gen|tleman, who united the elegance and politene&s;s of a court, with the &s;cholar, and the man of ge|nius. This repre&s;entation, in general, may be ju&s;t, yet it holds almo&s;t invariably true, that they who have ri&s;en from low life, &s;till retain &s;ome traces of their original. No cultivation, no genius, it &s;eems, is able entirely to &s;urmount this: There was one particular in which Mr. Prior verified the old pro|verb.</P>
<P>The &s;ame woman who could charm the waiter in a tavern, &s;till maintained her dominion over the emba&s;&s;ador at France. The Chloe of Prior, it &s;eems, was a woman in this &s;tation of life; but he never for&s;ook her in the heighth of his re|putation. Hence we may ob&s;erve, that a&s;&s;ocia|tions with women are the mo&s;t la&s;ting of all, and that when an eminent &s;tation rai&s;es a man above many other acts of conde&s;cen&s;ion, a mi&s;tre&s;s will maintain her influence, charm away the pride of greatne&s;s, and make the hero who fights, and the patriot who &s;peaks, for the liberty of his coun|try, a &s;lave to her. One would imagine however, that this woman, who was a Butcher's wife, mu&s;t either have been very hand&s;ome, or have had &s;ome|thing about her &s;uperior to people of her rank: but it &s;eems the ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e, and no better
<PB N="48" REF="51">
rea&s;on can be given for Mr. Prior's attachment to her, but that &s;he was his ta&s;te. Her hu&s;band &s;uf|fered their intrigue to go on unmole&s;ted; for he was proud even of &s;uch a connexion as this, with &s;o great a man as Prior; a &s;ingular in&s;tance of good nature.</P>
<P>In the year 1715 Mr. Prior was recalled from France, and upon his arrival was taken up by a warrant from the Hou&s;e of Commons; &s;hortly af|ter which, he underwent a very &s;trict examination by a Committee of the Privy Council. His poli|tical friend, lord Bolingbroke, fore&s;eeing a &s;torm, took &s;helter in France, and &s;ecured Harry, but le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nt poor Matt. in the lurch.</P>
<P>On the 10th of June Robert Walpole, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> mov|ed the Hou&s;e again&s;t him, and on the 17th Mr. Prior was ordered into clo&s;e cu&s;tody, and no per|&s;on was admitted to &s;ee him without leave from the Speaker. For the particulars of this procedure of the Parliament, both again&s;t Mr. Prior, and many others concerned in the public tran&s;actions of the preceding reign, we refer to the hi&s;tories of that time. In the year 1717 an Act of Grace was pa&s;&s;ed in favour of tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed the Hano|verian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as well as tho&s;e who had been in o|pen rebellion, but Mr. Prior was excepted out of it. At the clo&s;e of this year, however, he was di&s;|charged from his confinement, and retired to &s;pend the re&s;idue of his days at Downhall in E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>The &s;evere u&s;age which Mr. Prior met with, per|haps was the occa&s;ion of the following beautiful lines, addre&s;&s;ed to his Chloe;<Q><LG>

<P>Mr. Prior, after the fatigue of a length of years pa&s;t in various &s;ervices of action, was de&s;irous of &s;pending the remainder of his days in rural tran|quility, which the greate&s;t men of all ages have been fond of enjoying: he was &s;o happy as to &s;ucceed in his wi&s;h, living a very retired, and con|templative life, at Down<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nall in E&s;&s;ex, and found, as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, a more &s;olid, and innocent &s;atisfaction among woods, and meadows, than he had enjoyed in the hurry, and tumults of the world, the courts of Princes, or the conducting fo|reign negotiations; and where as he melodiou&s;ly &s;ings,<Q><L>The remnant of his days he &s;afely pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Nor found they lagg'd too &s;low, nor flew too fa&s;t;</L>
<L>He made his wi&s;h with his e&s;tate comply,</L>
<L>Joyful to live, yet not afraid to die.</L></Q></P>
<P>This great man died on the 18th of September, 1721, at Wimple in Cambridg&s;hire, the &s;eat of the earl of Oxford, with who&s;e friend&s;hip he had been honoured for &s;ome years. The death of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a per&s;on was ju&s;tly e&s;teemed
<PB N="53" REF="56">
an irreparable lo&s;s to the polite world, and his memory will be ever dear to tho&s;e, who have any reli&s;h for the mu&s;es in their &s;ofter charms. Some of the latter part of his life was employed in collecting materials for an Hi&s;tory of the Tran|&s;actions of his own Times, but his death unfortu|nately deprived the world of what the touches of &s;o ma&s;terly a hand, would have made exceeding va|luable.</P>
<P>Mr. Prior, by the &s;uffrage of all men of ta&s;te, holds the fir&s;t rank in poetry, for the delicacy of his numbers, the wittine&s;s of his turns, the acute|ne&s;s of his remarks, and, in one performance, for the amazing force of his &s;entiments. The &s;tile of our author is likewi&s;e &s;o pure, that our language knows no higher authority, and there is an air of original in his minute&s;t performances.</P>
<P>It would be &s;uperfluous to give any detail of his poems, they are in the hands of all who love poetry, and have been as often admired, as read. The performance however, for which he is mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, is his Solomon; a Poem in three Books, the fir&s;t on Knowledge, the &s;econd on Plea&s;ure, and the third on Power. We know few poems to which this is &s;econd, and it ju&s;tly e&s;tabli&s;hed his reputation as one of the be&s;t wri|ters of his age.</P>
<P>This &s;ublime work begins thus,<Q><L>Ye &s;ons of men, with ju&s;t regard attend,</L>
<L>Ob&s;erve the preacher, and believe the friend,</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;erious mu&s;e in&s;pires him to explain,</L>
<L>That all we act, and all we think is vain:</L>
<L>That in this pilgrimage of &s;eventy years,</L>
<L>O'er rocks of perils, and thro' vales of tears</L>
<L>De&s;tin'd to march, our doubtful &s;teps we tend,</L>
<L>Tir'd of the toil, yet fearful of its end:</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="57">

<L>The truths which from the&s;e pen&s;ive numbers flow,</L>
<L>That we pur&s;ue fal&s;e joy, and &s;uffer real woe.</L></Q></P>
<P>After an enquiry into, and an excellent de|&s;cription of the various operations, and effects of nature, the &s;y&s;tem of the heavens, &amp;c. and not be|ing fully informed of them, the fir&s;t Book con|cludes,<Q><L>How narrow limits were to wi&s;dom given?</L>

<L>And from the &s;ummit of a pathle&s;s coa&s;t</L>
<L>Sees infinite, and in that fight is lo&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the &s;econd Book the uncertainty, di&s;appoint|ment, and vexation attending plea&s;ure in ge|neral, are admirably de&s;cribed; and in the cha|racter of Solomon is &s;ufficiently &s;hewn, that no|thing deba&s;es maje&s;ty, or indeed any man, more than ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion.<Q><L>When thus the gath'ring &s;torms of wretched love</L>

<L>And &s;catter'd ruin, as the torrent pa&s;t.</L></Q></P>

<L>Nor nature's laws, with fruitle&s;s &s;orrow mourn;</L>

Her education was in the country, and her father dying when &s;he was but three years of age, and her mother not living 'till &s;he was twelve, the improvements our poete&s;s made were merely by her own indu&s;try and applica|tion. She was married before the age of fifteen, to a nephew of Sir Stephen Fox. This gentleman living with her but a year, &s;he afterwards married Mr. Carrol, an officer in the army, and &s;urvived him likewi&s;e in the &s;pace of a year and a half. She afterwards married Mr. Jo&s;eph Centlivre, yeoman of the mouth to his late Maje&s;ty. She gave early di&s;coveries of a genius for poetry, and Mr. Jacob in his Lives of the Poets tells us, that &s;he compo&s;ed a &s;ong before &s;he was &s;even years old. She is the author of fifteen plays; her ta|lent is comedy, particularly the contrivance of the plots, and incidents. Sir Richard Steele, in one

<HEAD>GEORGE STEPNEY, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS poet was de&s;cended of the family of the Stepneys of Pindigra&s;t in Pembroke|&s;hire, but born in We&s;tmin&s;ter in the year 1693. He received the rudiments of his education in We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, and after making &s;ome pro|gre&s;s in literature there, he was removed to Tri|nity College in Cambridge, where he was co|temporary with Charles Montague, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> afterwards earl of Hallifax; and being of the &s;ame college with him, a very &s;trict friend&s;hip was contracted between them. To this lucky accident of being early known to Mr. Montague, was owing all the preferment Mr. Stepney afterwards enjoyed, for he &s;eems not to have had parts &s;ufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n to have ri&s;en to any di&s;tinction, without the immediate patronage of &s;o great a man, as the lord Hallifax. When Stepney fir&s;t &s;et out in life, he was perhaps attached to the Tory intere&s;t, for one of the fir&s;t poems he wrote, was an Addre&s;s to king James the Second, on his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne. In this little piece, in which there is as little po|etry, he compares that monarch to Hercules, but with what propriety let the reader judge. Soon after the acce&s;&s;ion of James II. when Monmouth's rebeliion broke out, the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, to demon&s;trate their zeal for the King, thought proper to burn the picture of that ra&s;h Prince, who
<PB N="73" REF="76">
had formerly been their chancellor. Upon this occa&s;ion Stepney wrote &s;ome good ver&s;es, in an|&s;wer to this que&s;tion;
<Q><L>&mdash;&mdash;Sed quid</L><L>Turba Remi? &s;equitur fortunam, ut &s;emper et odit damnatos.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon the revolution he embraced another in|tere&s;t, and procured him&s;elf to be nominated for &s;everal foreign emba&s;&s;ies. In the year 1692 he went to the elector of Brandenburgh's court in quality of envoy, and, in the year following, to the Impe|rial court in the &s;ame character. In 1694 he was &s;ent to the elector of Saxony, and two years after to the electors of Mentz, Cologn, &amp;c. and the con|gre&s;s at Francfort. He was employed in &s;everal other emba&s;&s;ies, and in the year 1706 Queen Anne &s;ent him envoy to the States General. He was very &s;ucce&s;sful in his negotiations, which occa&s;ion|ed his con&s;tant employment in the mo&s;t weighty affairs. At his lei&s;ure hours he compo&s;ed &s;everal other pieces of poetry be&s;ides tho&s;e already men|tioned; which are chiefly the&s;e,<LIST>
<ITEM>An Epi&s;tle to the Earl of Hallifax, on his Ma|je&s;ty's Voyage to Holland.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A Tran&s;lation of the Eighth Satire of Juvenal.</ITEM>

<ITEM>The Au&s;trian Eagle.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Nature of Dreams.</ITEM>
<ITEM>A Poem to the Memory of Queen Mary.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e performances are not very long, nor are the &s;ubjects upon which they are written very con&s;i|derable. It &s;eems probable that the eminence to which Stepney ro&s;e, mu&s;t have been more owing to
<PB N="74" REF="77">
&s;ome per&s;onal kindne&s;s lord Hallifax had for him, than to his merit as a writer. In rai&s;ing Step|ney, his lord&s;hip might act as the friend of the man, but not as a patron of the poet. Friend|&s;hip, in many re&s;pects, participates of the nature of love; it begins, we know not how, it &s;trength|ens by imperceptible degrees, and grows into an e&s;tabli&s;hed firmne&s;s. Such might be the regard lord Hallifax had for Stepney, but we may ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert, from his lord&s;hip's exqui&s;ite ta&s;te in poetry, that he never could highly admire the pretty trifles which compo&s;e the works of this au|thor; and which are printed among&s;t the works of the Minor Poets, publi&s;hed &s;ome years ago by Mr. Ton&s;on in two volumes 12mo.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And likewi&s;e of another work of the &s;ame kind, in two vo|lumes al&s;o, publi&s;hed by one Cogan.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>Major RICHARDSON PACK.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was the &s;on of John Pack, of Stocke-A&s;h in Suffolk, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> who in the year 1697 was high &s;heriff of that county. He had his early education at a private country &s;chool, and was removed from thence to Merchant Taylor's, where he received his fir&s;t ta&s;te of letters; for he always reckoned that time which he &s;pent at the former &s;chool as lo&s;t, &s;ince he had only con|tracted bad habits, and was obliged to unlearn what had been taught him there.</P>
<P>At the age of &s;ixteen he was removed to St. John's College in Oxford. About eighteen his fa|ther entered him of the Middle Temple, de&s;ign|ing him for the profe&s;&s;ion of the Law; and by the peculiar indulgence of the trea&s;urer, and bench|ers of that honourable &s;ociety, he was at eight Terms &s;tanding admitted barri&s;ter, when he had not much exceeded the age of 20. But a &s;eden|tary, &s;tudious life agreeing as ill with his health, as a formal one with his inclinations, he did not long pur&s;ue tho&s;e &s;tudies. After &s;ome wavering in his thoughts, he at la&s;t determined his views to the army, as being better &s;uited to the gaiety of his temper, and the &s;prightline&s;s of his genius, and where he hoped to meet with more freedom, as well as more action. His fir&s;t command was that of a company of foot in March 1705.</P>

<HEAD>Sir WILLIAM DAWES, Baronet (Archbi&s;hop of YORK.)</HEAD>
<P>THIS revd. prelate was de&s;cended from an ancient, and honourable family in the coun|ty of E&s;&s;ex; he was educated at Merchant-Tay|lor's &s;chool, London, and from thence elected to St. John's College in Oxford, of which he was af|terwards fellow.</P>
<P>He was the younge&s;t of four brothers, three of whom dying young, the title, and e&s;tate of the family fell to him. As &s;oon as he had taken his fir&s;t degree in arts, and upon the family e|&s;tate devolving to him, he re&s;igned his fellow|&s;hip, and left Oxford. For &s;ome time he gave his attention to the affairs of his e&s;tate, but find|ing his inclination lead him more to &s;tudy, than rural affairs, he entered into holy orders. Sir William did not long remain in the church without preferment; his fortune, and family a&s;|&s;i&s;ted him to ri&s;e; for it often happens that the&s;e advantages will do much more for a man, as well in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as in other cla&s;&s;es of life, than the brighte&s;t parts without them. Before he was promoted to the mitre, he was made ma&s;ter of Catherine Hall in Cambridge, chaplain to Queen Anne, and dean of Bocking.</P>
<P>In the year 1708 he was con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, and in 1713 was tran&s;lated to the arch|bi&s;hopric

<HEAD>WILLIAM CONGREVE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was de&s;cended from the an|cient hou&s;e of Congreve in Stafford&s;hire, but authors differ as to the place of his birth; &s;ome contend that he was born in Ireland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Dictionary.</NOTE>, others that he drew his fir&s;t breath at the village of Bard&s;a, near Leeds in York&s;hire, which was the e&s;tate of a near relation of his by his mother's &s;ide. Mr. Jacob, in his preface to the Lives of the Poets, has in|formed us, that he had the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Congreve in that work, who communicat|ed to him many particulars of the lives of cotem|porary writers, as well as of him&s;elf, and as Mr. Congreve can hardly be thought ignorant of the place of his own birth, and Mr. Jacob has a&s;&s;erted it to be in England, no room is left to doubt of it. The learned antiquary of Ireland, Sir James Ware, has reckoned our author among&s;t his own country worthies, from the relation of
<PB N="84" REF="87">
Southern; but Mr. Congreve's own account, if Ja|cob may be relied on, is more than equal to that of Southern, who po&s;&s;ibly might be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>About the year 1671, or 1672, our author was born, and his father carried him, when a child, into Ireland, where he then had a command in the army, but afterwards was entru&s;ted with the management of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, belonging to the noble family of Burlington, which fixed his re&s;idence there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wil&s;on's Memoirs of Congreve.</NOTE>. Mr. Congreve received the fir&s;t tincture of letters in the great &s;chool of Kilken|ny, and, according to common report, gave early proofs of a poetical genius; his fir&s;t attempt in poetry was a copy of ver&s;es on the death of his ma&s;ter's Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nye.</P>
<P>He went from the &s;chool of Kilkenny to the univer&s;ity of Dublin, where under the direction of Dr. George A&s;h, he acquired a general knowledge of the cla&s;&s;ics. His father, who was de&s;irous that his &s;tudies &s;hould be directed to a profitable em|ployment, &s;ent him over to England a little after the revolution, and placed him as a &s;tud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nnt in the Middle-Temple. But the &s;evere &s;tudy of the Law was &s;o ill adapted to the &s;prightly genius of Con|greve. that he never attempted to reconcile him&s;elf to a way of life, for which he had the greate&s;t aver|&s;ion. But however he di&s;appointed his friends with re&s;pect to the proficiency they expected him to make in the Law; yet it is certain he was not negligent in tho&s;e &s;tudies to which his genius led him.</P>
<P>Mr. Congreve's fir&s;t performance, written when b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nt a youth of &s;eventeen, was a Novel, dedicat|ed to Mrs. Katherine I eve&s;on, which gave proof, not only of a great vivacity of wit, but al|&s;o a fluency of &s;tile, and a &s;olid judgment. He was con&s;cious that young men in their early producti|ons generally aimed at a florid &s;tile, and enthu&s;i|a&s;tic
<PB N="85" REF="88">
de&s;criptions, without any regard to the plot, fable, or &s;ub&s;erviency of the parts; for this rea|&s;on he formed a new model, and gave an exam|ple how works of that kind &s;hould be written. He pur&s;ued a regular plan, ob&s;erved a general moral, and carried on a connexion, as well as di&s;tinction, between his characters.</P>
<P>This performance is entitled Incognita, or Love and Duty Reconciled; it has been a&s;&s;erted that this is a real hi&s;tory, and though the &s;cene is laid in Italy, the adventures happened in England; it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to enter into the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of this entertaining piece, or to attempt giving the reader a key to what the writer took &s;o much pains to conceal. It appears from this piece, that Mr. Congreve aimed at perfection from the very beginning, and his de&s;ign in writing this novel, was to &s;hew, how novels ought to be writ|ten. Let us hear what he &s;ays him&s;elf, and from thence we &s;hall entertain a higher opinion of his abilities, than could po&s;&s;ibly be rai&s;ed by the warm|e&s;t commendations. After very judiciou&s;ly ob|&s;erving, that there is the &s;ame relation between romances and novels as between tragedy and comedy, he proceeds thus: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Since all traditions mu&s;t indi&s;putably give glace to the drama, and &s;ince there is no po&s;&s;ibility of giving that life to the writing, or repetition of a &s;tory, which it has in the action; I re&s;olved in another beauty to imitate dramatic writing, namely, in the de|&s;ign, contexture, and re&s;ult in the plot. I have not ob&s;erved it before in a novel. Some I have &s;een begin with an unexpected accident, which has been the only &s;urprizing part of the &s;tory, cau&s;e enough to make the &s;equel look flat, tedious, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nd in&s;ipid; for 'tis but rea&s;onable the reader &s;hould expect, if not to ri&s;e, at lea&s;t, to keep upon a level in the entertainment, for &s;o he may be kept on, in hopes, that &s;ome time,
<PB N="86" REF="89">
or other, it may mend; but the other is &s;uch a baulk to a man, 'tis carrying him up &s;tairs to &s;hew him the dining room, and afterwards force him to make a meal in the kitchen. This I have not only endeavoured to avoid, but al&s;o have u&s;ed a method for the contrary purpo&s;e. The de&s;ign of this novel is obvious, after the fir&s;t meeting of Aurelian and Hippolito, with Incognita, and Leonora; the difficulty is in bringing it to pa&s;s, maugre all apparent ob&s;ta|cles within the compa&s;s of two days. How ma|ny probable ca&s;ualties intervene, in oppo&s;ition to the main de&s;ign, viz. of marrying two couple &s;o oddly engaged in an intricare amour, I leave the reader at his lei&s;ure to con&s;ider; as al&s;o whether every ob&s;tacle does not, in the progre&s;s of the &s;tory, act as &s;ub&s;ervient to that purpo&s;e, which at fir&s;t it &s;eems to oppo&s;e. In a comedy this would be called the unity of action, here it may pretend to no more than an unity of contri|vance. The &s;cene is continued in Florence from the commencement of the amour, and the time from fir&s;t to la&s;t, is but three days.'</Q></P>
<P>Soon after Mr. Congreve's return to England, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf, during a &s;low recovery from a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, with writing a comedy. Captain Southern, in conjunction with Mr. Dryden, and Arthur Manwayring, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> revi&s;ed this performance, which was the Old Batchelor; of which Mr. Dry|den &s;aid, he never &s;aw &s;uch a fir&s;t play in his life, adding, that the author not being acquainted with the &s;tage, or the town, it would be pity to have it mi&s;carry for want of a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Mr. Tho|mas Davenant, who had then the direction of the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, had &s;o high a &s;en&s;e of the merit of the piece, and was &s;o charmed with the author's conver&s;ation, that he granted him the freedom of the hou&s;e before his play came on, which, according to the maxims
<PB N="87" REF="90">
of theatrical government, was not only an unu&s;u|al, but an unprecedented favour. In 1693 the Old Batchelor was acted before a numerous, and polite audience. The play was received with &s;uch general applau&s;e, that Mr. Congreve was then con|&s;idered as a prop to the declining &s;tage, and a ri&s;|ing genius in dramatic poetry. It was this play, and the &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;s which attended it upon the &s;tage, that introduced our author to the acquain|tance of the earl of Hallifax, who was then the profe&s;&s;ed patron of men of wit; and who, being de&s;irous to rai&s;e a man of &s;o promi&s;ing a genius, above the nece&s;&s;ity of too ha&s;ty productions, made him one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for licen&s;ing Hackney coaches. The earl be&s;towed upon him &s;oon after a place in the Pipe-Office, and gave him likewi&s;e a po&s;t in the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, to the value of 600 l. per annum.</P>
<P>In the following year Mr. Congreve brought upon the &s;tage the Double Dealer, which met not with &s;o good a reception as the former.</P>
<P>Mr. Congreve has informed us in the dedication of this play, to Charles Montague, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> that he was very a&s;&s;iduous to learn from the critics what objections could be found to it; but, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have heard nothing to provoke an an&s;wer. That which looks mo&s;t like an objection, does not re|late in particular to this play, but to all; or mo&s;t that ever have been written, and that is &s;oliloquy; therefore I will an&s;wer it, not only for my own &s;ake, but to &s;ave others the trouble to whom it may be hereafter objected. I grant, that for a man to talk to him&s;elf, appears ab&s;urd, and unnatural, and indeed it is &s;o in mo&s;t ca&s;es, but the circum&s;tances which may at|tend the occa&s;ion, makes great alteration. It often happens to a man to have de&s;igns, which require him to him&s;elf, and in their nature can|not admit of a confident. Such for certain
<PB N="88" REF="91">
is all villainy, and other le&s;s mi&s;chievous inten|tions may be very improper to be communicated to a &s;econd per&s;on. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, therefore the audience mu&s;t ob&s;erve, whether the per&s;on up|on the &s;tage takes any notice of them at all, or no: for if he &s;uppo&s;es any one to be by, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Yet Ma&s;kwell purpo&s;ely talks to him&s;elf, de&s;igning to be overheard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Touchwood; undoubtedly an error in the conduct, and went of art in the author. This he &s;eems here to forget, or would not remember it.</NOTE> when he talks to him&s;elf, it is mon&s;trous and ridicu|lous to the la&s;t degree; nay not only in this ca&s;e, but in any part of a play, if there is ex|pre&s;&s;ed any knowledge of an audience it is in|&s;ufferable. But otherwi&s;e, when a man in a &s;o|liloquy rea&s;ons with him&s;elf, and pro's and con's, and weighs all his de&s;igns, we ought not to ima|gine that this man either talks to us, or to him|&s;elf; he is only thinking, and thinking &s;uch mat|ter, as it were inexcu&s;able folly in him to &s;peak. But, becau&s;e we are concealed &s;pectators of the plot in agitation, and the poet finds it nece&s;&s;a|ry to let us know the whole my&s;tery of his contrivance, he is willing to inform us of this per&s;on's thoughts, and to that end is forced to make u&s;e of the expedient of &s;peech, no other, or better way being yet invented for the communi|cation of thought.'</Q></P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the &s;ame year Queen Mary died. Upon that occa&s;ion Mr. Congreve pro|duced an elegiac Pa&s;toral, a compo&s;ition which the admirers of this poet have extolled in the mo&s;t lavi&s;h terms of admiration, but which &s;eems not to merit the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">\ncen&s;e it obtained.</P>
<P>When Mr. Betterton opened the new hou&s;e at Lincoln's-Inn, Congreve took part with him, and gave him his celebrated comedy of Love for Love, then introduced upon the &s;tage, with the mo&s;t ex|traordinary
<PB N="89" REF="92">
&s;ucce&s;s. This comedy, with &s;ome more of our author's, was &s;martly critici&s;ed by the ngeni|ous Mr. Collier, as containing le&s;&s;ons of immora|lity, and a repre&s;entation of loo&s;e characters, which can never, in his opinion, appear on a &s;tage with|out corrupting the audience.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;rs. Congreve, Dennis, and Dryden, engaged in a vigorous defence of the Engli&s;h &s;tage, and en|deavoured to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch characters being introduced in order to be expo&s;ed, and laughed at. To all their defences Mr. Collier re|plied, and managed the point with &s;o much learn|ing, wit, and keenne&s;s, that in the opinion of many, he had the better of his antagoni&s;ts, e&s;pecially Mr. Congreve, who&s;e comedies it mu&s;t be owned, though they are admirably written, and the cha|racters &s;trongly marked, are &s;o loo&s;e, that they have given great offence: and &s;urely we pay too dear for plea&s;ure, when we have it at the expence of morality.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in ano|ther kind of poetry, viz. an irregular Ode on the taking Namure, which the critics have allowed to contain fine &s;entiments, gracefully expre&s;&s;ed. His reputation as a comic poet being &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed, he was de&s;irous of extending his fame, by producing a tragedy. It has been alledged, that &s;ome, who were jealous of his growing reputation, put him upon this ta&s;k, in order, as they imagined, to dimini&s;h it, for he &s;eemed to be of too gay and lively a di&s;po&s;ition for tragedy, and in all likeli|hood would mi&s;carry in the attempt. However,</P>
<P>In 1697, after the expectation of the town had been much rai&s;ed, the Mourning Bride appeared on the New Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields: few plays ever excited &s;o great an ardour of expecta|tion as this, and very few ever &s;ucceeded to &s;uch an extravagant degree. There is &s;omething new in the management of the plot; after moving the

<P>The controver&s;y we have ju&s;t now mentioned, was thought to have occa&s;ioned a di&s;like in Mr. Congreve towards the &s;tage; yet he afterwards pro|duced another comedy called The Way of the World, which was &s;o ju&s;t a picture of the world, that, as an author prettily &s;ays, <Q>The world could not bear it.</Q></P>
<P>The reception this play met with, compleated our author's di&s;gu&s;t to the theatre; upon which Mr. Dennis, who was a warm friend to Congreve, made this fine ob&s;ervation, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that Mr. Congreve quitted the &s;tage early, and that comedy left it with him.'</Q></P>
<P>It is &s;aid that when Congreve found his play met with but indifferent &s;ucce&s;s, he came in a pa&s;&s;ion on the &s;tage, and de&s;ired the audience to &s;ave them|&s;elves the trouble of &s;hewing their di&s;like; for he never intended to write again for the Theatre, nor &s;ubmit his works to the cen&s;ure of impotent critics. In this particular he kept his word with them, and as if he had fore&s;een the fate of his play, he took an ample revenge, in his Epilogue, of the race of Little Snarlers, who excited by envy, and &s;upported by fal&s;e ideas of their own importance, dared to con&s;titute them&s;elves judges of wit, without any ju&s;t preten&s;ions to it. This play has long ago tri|umphed over its enemies, and is now in great e&s;|teem among&s;t the be&s;t judges of Theatrical Enter|tainments.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Congreve quitted the &s;tage, yet did not he give up the cau&s;e of poetry; for on the death of the marquis of Blandford, the only &s;on of the duke of Marlborough, which happened in
<PB N="91" REF="94">
1705, we find him compo&s;ing a pa&s;toral to &s;often the grief of that illu&s;trious family, which he ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the lord trea&s;urer Godolphin.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, the extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s of the duke of Marlborough's arms, furni&s;hed him with materials for an Ode to Queen Anne. In another Pindaric Ode he celebrates the lord Godol|phin; taking occa&s;ion from that nobleman's delight in hor&s;e-racing to imitate the Greek Poet in his favourite manner of writing, by an elegant digre&s;|&s;ion; to which he added a critici&s;m on that &s;pe|cies of poetry.</P>
<P>As in the early part of his life, Mr. Congreve had received favours from people of a le&s;s exalted &s;tati|on, &s;o of the&s;e he was highly &s;en&s;ible, and never let &s;lip any opportunity of &s;hewing his gratitude. He wrote an Epilogue to his old friend Southern's Tragedy of Oroonoko; and Mr. Dryden has ac|knowledged his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the tran&s;lation of Virgil: He contributed by his Ver&s;ion of the eleventh Sa|tire of Juvenal, to the tran&s;lation of that poet, publi&s;hed al&s;o by Mr. Dryden, to whom Mr. Con|greve wrote a copy of Ver&s;es on his Tran&s;lation of Per&s;ius. He wrote likewi&s;e a Prologue for a Play of Mr. Charles Dryden's, full of kindne&s;s for that young gentleman, and of re&s;pect for his father.</P>
<P>But the noble&s;t te&s;timony he gave of his filial re|gard to the memory of his poetical father, Mr. John Dryden, was the Panegyric he wrote upon his works, contained in the dedication of Dryden's plays to the duke of Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Mr. Congreve tran&s;lated the third Book of Ovid's Art of Love; &s;ome favourite pa&s;&s;ages from the Iliad, and writ &s;ome Epigrams, in all which he was not un&s;ucce&s;sful, though at the &s;ame time he has been ex|ceeded by his cotemporaries in the &s;ame attempts.</P>
<P>The author of the elegant Letters, not long ago publi&s;hed under the name of Fitz. O&s;borne, has taken &s;ome pains to &s;et before his readers the ver|&s;ion
<PB N="92" REF="95">
of tho&s;e parts of Homer, tran&s;lated by our au|thor, and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages by Pope and Tickell, in which compari&s;on the palm is very de&s;erved|ly yielded to Pope.</P>
<P>Our author wrote a Satire called Doris, celebrated by Sir Richard Steele, who was a warm friend to Mr. Congreve. He al&s;o wrote the Judgment of Paris, a Ma&s;que; and the Opera of Semele; of the&s;e, the former was acted with great applau&s;e, and the latter is finely &s;et to mu&s;ic by Mr. Eccles. The la&s;t of his Poetical Works, is his Art of Plea&s;ing, addre&s;&s;ed to Sir Richard Temple, the late vi&s;count Cobham. He has written many Pro&s;e Epi&s;tles, di&s;|per&s;ed in the works of other writers, and his E&s;&s;ay on Humour in Comedy, publi&s;hed in a Collection of Dennis's Letters, is an entertaining, and cor|rect piece of critici&s;m: All his other Letters are written with a great deal of wit and &s;pirit, a fine flow of language; and are &s;o happily inter|mixt with a lively and inoffen&s;ive raillery, that it is impo&s;&s;ible not to be plea&s;ed with them at the fir&s;t reading: we may be &s;atisfied from the peru&s;al of them, that his conver&s;ation mu&s;t have been ve|ry engaging, and therefore we need not wonder that he was care&s;&s;ed by the greate&s;t men of his time, or that they courted his friend&s;hip by every act of kindne&s;s in their power.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of Mr. Congreve, that he was a particu|lar favourite with the ladies, &s;ome of whom were of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. He indulged none of tho&s;e reveries, and affected ab&s;ences &s;o peculiar to men of wit: He was &s;prightly as well as elegant in his manner, and &s;o much the favourite of Henrietta duche&s;s of Marlborough, that even after his death, &s;he cau&s;ed an image of him to be every day placed at her toilet-table, to which &s;he would talk as to the living Mr. Congreve, with all the freedom of the mo&s;t polite and unre&s;erved conver&s;ation.

Mrs. Bracegirdle likewi&s;e had the highe&s;t venera|tion for our author, and joined with her Grace in a boundle&s;s profu&s;ion of &s;orrow upon his death. Some think, he had made a better figure in his La&s;t Will, had he remembered his friend&s;hip he profe&s;&s;ed for Mrs. Bracegirdle, who&s;e admirable performance added &s;pirit to his dramatic pieces; but he forgot her, and gratified his vanity by chu&s;ing to make a rich duche&s;s his &s;ole legatee, and executrix.</P>
<P>Mr. Congreve was the &s;on of fortune, as well as of the mu&s;es. He was early preferred to an affluent &s;ituation, and no change of mini&s;try ever affected him, nor was he ever removed from any po&s;t he en|joyed, except to a better.</P>
<P>His place in the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and his office of &s;ecretary in Jamaica, are &s;aid to have brought him in upwards of 1200 l. a year; and he was &s;o far an oeconomi&s;t, as to rai&s;e from thence a competent e&s;tate. No man of his learning ever pa&s;s'd thro' life with more ea&s;e, or le&s;s envy; and as in the dawn of his reputation he was very dear to the greate&s;t wits of his time, &s;o during his whole life he pre&s;erved the utmo&s;t re&s;pect of, and re|ceived continual marks of e&s;teem from, men of genius and letters, without ever being involved in any of their quarrels, or drawing upon him&s;elf the lea&s;t mark of di&s;ta&s;te, or, even di&s;&s;atisfaction. The greate&s;t part of the la&s;t twenty years of his life were &s;pent in ea&s;e and retirement, and he gave him&s;elf no trouble about reputation. When the celebrated Voltaire was in England, he waited upon Congreve, and pa&s;s'd &s;ome compliments upon him, as to the reputation and merit of his works; Congreve thanked him, but at the &s;ame time told that inge|nious foreigner, he did not chu&s;e to be con&s;idered as an author, but only as a private gentleman, and in that light expected to be vi&s;ited. Voltaire
<PB N="94" REF="97">
an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That if he had never been any thing but a private gentleman, in all probability, he had never been troubled with that vi&s;it.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Voltaire upon this occa&s;ion ob&s;erves, that he was not a little di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a piece of vanity:&mdash;This was indeed the highe&s;t in&s;tance of it, that perhaps can be produced. A man who owed to his wit and writings the reputation, as well as the fortune, he acquired, pretending to dive&s;t him&s;elf of human nature to &s;uch a degree, as to have no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own merit, was the mo&s;t ab&s;urd piece of vanity that ever entered into the heart of man; and of all vanity, that is the greate&s;t which ma&s;ks it&s;elf under the appearance of the oppo&s;ite quality.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of his life, he was much troubled with the gout; and for this rea&s;on, in the &s;ummer of the year 1728, he made a tour to Bath, for the benefit of the waters, where he had the misfortune to be overturned in his chariot, from which time he complained of a pain in his &s;ide, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from &s;ome in|ward brui&s;e. Upon his return to London, he perceived his health gradually decline, which he bore with fortitude and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>On January the 19th, 1728-9, he yielded his la&s;t breath, about five o'clock in the morning, at his hou&s;e in Surrey-&s;treet in the Strand, in the fif|ty-&s;eventh year of his age. On the &s;unday fol|lowing, January 26, his corp&s;e lay in &s;tate in the Jeru&s;alem-Chamber, from whence the &s;ame evening, between the hours of nine and ten, it was carried with great decency and &s;olemnity to Henry the VIIth's Chapel; and after the funeral &s;ervice was performed, it was interred in the Abbey. The pall was &s;upported by the duke of Bridge|water, earl of Godolphin, lord Cobham, lord Wil|mington,
<PB N="95" REF="98">
the honourable George Berkley, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Brigadier-general Churchill; and colonel Congreve followed his corp&s;e as chief mourner; &s;ome time after, a neat and elegant monument was erected to his memory, by Henrietta duche&s;s of Marlbo|rough.</P>
<P>Mr. Congreve's reputation is &s;o exten&s;ive, and his works &s;o generally read, that any &s;pecimen of his poetry may be deemed &s;uperfluous. But find|ing an epi&s;tle of our author's in the Biographia Brittannica, not in&s;erted in his works, it may not be improper to give it a place here. It is addre&s;&s;ed to the lord vi&s;count Cobham, and the ingenious authors inform us, that they copied it from a MS. very correct.</P>
<P>As in this poem there is a vi&s;ible allu&s;ion to the mea&s;ures, which the writer thought were too complai&s;ant to the French, it is evident it mu&s;t have been penned but a very &s;mall time before his death.<Q><LG>

<HEAD>Sir JOHN VANBRUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman was de&s;cended from an antient family in Che&s;hire, which came ori|ginally from France; though by the name it would appear to be of Dutch extraction. He received a very liberal education, and became eminent for his poetry, and &s;kill in architecture, to both which he di&s;covered an early propen&s;ion. It is &s;omewhat remarkable in the Hi&s;tory of Poetry, that when the &s;pirit of Tragedy, in a great mea&s;ure, declined, when Otway and Lee were dead, and Dryden was approaching to old age, that Comedy &s;hould then begin to flouri&s;h; at an Aera, which one would not have expected to prove au&s;picious to the cau&s;e of mirth.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame time ro&s;e Mr. Congreve, and Sir John Vanbrugh; who, without any invidious reflection on the genius of others, gave a new life to the &s;tage, and re&s;tored it to reputation, which before their appearance had been for &s;ome time &s;inking. Happy would it have been for the world, and &s;ome advantage to the memory of the&s;e comic writers, if they had di&s;covered their wit, without any mixture of that licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which while it plea&s;ed, tended to corrupt the audi|ence.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="103">
The fir&s;t &s;tep our author made into life, was in the character of an en&s;ign in the army. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very ready wit, and an agreeable elocution. He happened &s;omewhere in his winter quarters, to contract an acquaintance with Sir Thomas Skipwith, and received a particular obligation from him. He had very early di&s;|covered a ta&s;te for dramatic writing, to improve which he made &s;ome attempts in that way, and had the draft or out-lines of two plays lying by him, at the time his acquaintance commenced with Sir Thomas. This gentleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;hare in a Theatrical Patent, though he very little concerned him&s;elf in the conduct of it; but that he might not appear altogether remi&s;s, he thought to procure &s;ome advantage to the &s;tage, by having our author's play, called the Relap&s;e, to be acted upon it. In this he was not di&s;appointed, for the Relap&s;e &s;ucceeded beyond the warme&s;t expecta|tion, and rai&s;ed Vanbrugh's name very high a|mong&s;t the writers for the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Tho' this play met with greater applau&s;e, than the author expected, yet it was not without its enemies. The&s;e were people of the graver &s;ort, who blam|ed the loo&s;ene&s;s of the &s;cenes, and the unguarded freedom of the dialect. The&s;e complaints induced Vanbrugh to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon them in his preface, which he thus begins, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'To go about to excu&s;e half the defects this abortive brat is come into the world with, would be to provoke the town with a long u&s;ele&s;s preface, when 'tis, I doubt, &s;ufficiently &s;our'd already, by a tedious play.' <P>'I do therefore, with all the humility of a re|penting &s;inner, confe&s;s it wants every thing&mdash;but length, and in that I hope the &s;evere&s;t critics will be plea&s;ed to acknowledge, I have not been
<PB N="101" REF="104">
wanting. But my mode&s;ty will &s;ure attone for every thing, when the world &s;hall know it is &s;o great, I am even to this day in&s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e two &s;hining graces, in the play (which &s;ome part of the town is plea&s;ed to compliment me with) bla&s;phemy and bawdy. For my part I cannot find them out; if there were any ob&s;cene ex|pre&s;&s;ions upon the &s;tage, here they are in print; for I have dealt fairly, I have not &s;unk a &s;yllable, that could be ranged under that head, and yet I believe with a &s;teady faith, there is not one woman of real reputation in town, but when &s;he has read it impartially over in her clo&s;et, will find it &s;o innocent, &s;he'll think it no affront to her prayer book, to lay it upon the &s;ame &s;helf.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Being encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of the Relap&s;e, he yielded to the &s;ollicitation of lord Hallifax, who had read &s;ome of the loo&s;e &s;heets of his Pro|vok'd Wife, to fini&s;h that piece; and after throw|ing them into a proper form, gave the play to the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. Though Sir John had a greater inclination to &s;erve the other com|pany, yet the reque&s;t of lord Hallifax, &s;o eminent a patron of the poets, could not be re&s;i&s;ted. Sir Thomas Skipwith was not offended at &s;o rea&s;onable a compliance, and the Provok'd Wife was acted 1698, with &s;ucce&s;s. Some critics likewi&s;e object|ed again&s;t this, as a loo&s;e performance; and that it taught the married women how to revenge them&s;elves on their hu&s;bands, who &s;hould offend them.</P>
<P>The play has indeed this moral, that &s;uch hu&s;|bands as re&s;emble Sir John Brute, may expect that neglected beauty, and abu&s;ed virtue, may be provoked to yield to the motives of revenge,
<PB N="102" REF="105">
and that the forcible &s;ollicitations of an agreeable per&s;on, who not only demon&s;trates a value, but a pa&s;&s;ion for what the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;lights, may be &s;uf|ficiently prevalent with an injured wife to forfeit her honour.</P>
<P>Though this event may often fall out, that the brutality of a hu&s;band produces the in&s;idelity of a wife, yet it need not be &s;hewn upon the &s;tage; women are not generally &s;o tame in their natures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">to bear neglect with patience, and the natural re&s;entments of the human heart will without any other monitor point out the method of revenge. Be|&s;ides, every hu&s;band ought not to be deemed a brute, becau&s;e a too delicate, or ceremonious wife, &s;hall, in the abundance of her caprice, be&s;tow upon him that appellation. Many women who have beheld this repre&s;entation, may have been &s;timulated to imitate lady Brute in her method of revenge, without hav|ing &s;uffered her provocation. This play verifies the ob&s;ervation of Mr. Pope, <Q><L>That Van wants grace, who never wanted wit.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next play which Sir John Vanburgh intro|duced upon the &s;tage was Ae&s;op, a Comedy; in two Parts, acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane 1698. This was originally written in French, by Mr. Bour&s;art, about &s;ix years before; but the &s;cenes of Sir Polidorus Hog&s;tye, the Players, the Senator, and the Beau, were added by our author. This performance contains a great deal of gene|ral &s;atire, and u&s;eful morality; notwith&s;tanding which, it met with but a cold reception from the audi|ence, and its run terminated in about 8 or 9 days. This &s;eemed the more &s;urpri&s;ing to men of ta&s;te, as the French comedy from which it was taken, was played to crowded audiences for a month together.
<PB N="103" REF="106">
Sir John has rather improved upon the original by adding new &s;cenes, than &s;uffered it to be dimini&s;h|ed in a tran&s;lation, but the French and the Eng|li&s;h ta&s;te was in that particular very different. We cannot better account for the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this excellent piece, than in the words of Mr. Cib|ber's Apology for his own Life, when &s;peak|ing of this play, he has the following ob&s;ervation; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The character that delivers precepts of wi&s;dom, is, in &s;ome &s;ort, &s;evere upon the auditor, for &s;hewing him one wi&s;er than him&s;elf; but when folly is his object, he applauds him&s;elf for be|ing wi&s;er than the coxcomb he laughs at, and who is not more plea&s;ed with an occa&s;ion to commend, than to accu&s;e him&s;elf?'</Q></P>
<P>Sir John Vanbrugh, it is &s;aid, had great facility in writing, and is not a little to be admired for the &s;pirit, ea&s;e, and readine&s;s, with which he pro|duced his plays. Notwith&s;tanding his extraordina|ry expedition, there is a clear and lively &s;impli|city in his wit, that is equally di&s;tant from the pedantry of learning, and the lowne&s;s of &s;currili|ty. As the face of a fine lady, with her hair undre&s;&s;ed, may appear in the morning in its bright|e&s;t glow of beauty; &s;uch were the productions of Vanbrugh, adorned with only the negligent graces of nature.</P>
<P>Mr. Cibber ob&s;erves, that there is &s;omething &s;o catching to the ear, &s;o ea&s;y to the memory in all he wrote, that it was ob&s;erved by the actors of his time, that the &s;tile of no author what&s;oever gave the memory le&s;s trouble than that of Sir John Vanbrugh, which he him&s;elf has confirmed by a plea&s;ing experience. His wit and humour was &s;o little laboured, that his mo&s;t entertaining &s;cenes &s;eemed to be no more than his common conver&s;ation committed to paper. As his concep|tions
<PB N="104" REF="107">
were &s;o full of life and humour, it is not much to be wondered at, if his mu&s;e &s;hould be &s;ometimes too warm to wait the &s;low pace of judgment, or to endure the drudgery of forming a regular Fable to them.</P>
<P>That Sir John was capable of a great force of thinking, appears abundantly clear from that &s;cene between Ae&s;op and a country gentleman, who comes to complain of the bad conduct of tho&s;e in power. The dialogue is at once &s;en&s;ible and anima|ted. Ae&s;op &s;hews him what he reckoned the op|pre&s;&s;ions of the admini&s;tration, flowed from the prejudices of ignorance, contemplated through the medium of popular di&s;content. In the interview between the Beau and the Philo&s;opher, there is the following pretty fable. The Beau ob&s;erves to Ae&s;op, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It is is very well; it is very well, old &s;park; I &s;ay it is very well; becau&s;e I han't a pair of plod &s;hoes, and a dirty &s;hirt, you think a woman won't venture upon me for hu&s;band.&mdash;Why now to &s;hew you, old father, how little you philo&s;ophers know the ladies.&mdash;I'll tell you an adventure of a friend of mine.'</Q><Q><LG>

<P>The reputation which Sir John gained by his comedies was rewarded with greater advantages, than what ari&s;e from the u&s;ual profits of writ|ing for the &s;tage. He was appointed Claren|cieux King at Arms, a place which he &s;ome time held, and at la&s;t di&s;po&s;ed of. In Augu&s;t 1716 he was appointed &s;urveyor of the works at Green|wich Ho&s;pital; he was likewi&s;e made comptrol|ler-general of his Maje&s;ty's works, and &s;urveyor of the gardens and waters, the profits of which places, collectively con&s;idered, mu&s;t amount to a very con&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="109">
In &s;ome part of our author's life (for we can|not ju&s;tly a&s;certain the time) he gratified an inclination of vi&s;iting France. As curio&s;ity no doubt induced him to pa&s;s over to that country, he lo&s;t no time in making &s;uch ob&s;ervations as could enable him to di&s;cern the &s;pirit, and genius of that polite people. His ta&s;te for architecture excited him to take a &s;urvey of the &s;ortifications in that kingdom; but the ardour of his curio&s;ity dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n him into a &s;nare, out of which he found great difficulty to e&s;cape. When he was one day &s;ur|veying &s;ome &s;ortifications with the &s;tricte&s;t atten|tion, he was taken notice of by an Engineer, &s;e|cured by authority, and then carried pri&s;oner to the Ba&s;tile in Paris. The French were con|firmed in &s;u&s;picions of his de&s;ign, by &s;everal plans being found in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the time he was &s;eized upon; but as the French, except in ca&s;es of Here&s;y, u&s;e their pri&s;oners with gentle|ne&s;s and humanity, Sir John found his confine|ment &s;o endurable, that he amus'd him&s;elf in drawing rude draughts of &s;ome comedies. This cir|cum&s;tance rai&s;ing curio&s;ity in Paris, &s;everal of the noble&s;&s;e vi&s;ited him in the Ba&s;tile, when Sir John, who &s;poke their language with fluency and ele|gance, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into their favour by the vivacity of his wit, and the peculiarity of his hu|mour. He gained &s;o much upon their affections, that they repre&s;ented him to the French King in an innocent light, and by that means procured his liberty &s;ome days before the &s;ollicitation came from England.</P>
<P>Sir John Vanbrugh formed a project of build|ing a &s;tately theatre in the Hay-market, for which he had intere&s;t enough to rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;cription of thirty per&s;ons of quality at 100 l. each, in con&s;i|deration whereof, every &s;ub&s;criber for his own life, &s;hould be admitted to whatever entertain|ments
<PB N="107" REF="110">
&s;hould be publickly performed there, with|out farther payment for entrance.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t &s;tone that was laid in this theatre, were in&s;cribed the words LITTLE WHIG, as a com|pliment to a lady of extraordinary beauty, then the celebrated toa&s;t, and pride of that party. In the year 1706 when this hou&s;e was fini&s;hed, Mr. Betterton and his copartners put them&s;elves un|der the direction of Sir John Vanbrugh and Mr. Congreve; imagining that the conduct of two &s;uch eminent authors would re&s;tore their ruined affairs; but they found their expectations were too &s;an|guine, for though Sir John was an expeditious writer, yet Mr. Congreve was too judicious to let any thing come unfini&s;hed out of his hands; be|&s;ides, every proper convenience of a good the|atre had been &s;acrificed to &s;hew the audience a va&s;t triumphal piece of architecture, in which plays, by means of the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the dome, could not be &s;ucce&s;sfully repre&s;ented, becau&s;e the actors could not be di&s;tinctly heard.</P>
<P>Not long before this time the Italian Opera began to &s;teal into England, but in as rude a di&s;|gui&s;e, and as unlike it&s;elf as po&s;&s;ible; notwith|&s;tanding which the new mon&s;ter plea&s;ed, though it had neither grace, melody, nor action to recom|mend it. To &s;trike in therefore with the pre|vailing fa&s;hion, Vanbrugh and Congreve opened their New Theatre in the Hay-market, with a tran&s;lated Opera, &s;et to Italian mu&s;ic, called The Triumph of Love, but it met with a cold recep|tion, being performed only three days, to thin hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Immediately upon the failure of the Opera, Vanbrugh produced his comedy called The Con|federacy, greatly improved from the Bourgois &agrave; la mode of Dancour. The &s;ucce&s;s of this play was not equal to its merit; for it is written in an uncommon vein of humour, and abounds with the
<PB N="108" REF="111">
mo&s;t lively &s;trokes of raillery. The pro&s;pects of gain from this theatre were &s;o very u promi&s;ing, that Congreve, in a few months, gave up his &s;hare and intere&s;t in the government wholly to Sir John Vanbrugh; who being now &s;ole proprietor of the hou&s;e, was under a nece&s;&s;ity to exert him&s;elf in its &s;upport. As he had a happier talent for throwing the Engli&s;h &s;pirit into his tran&s;lations of French plays, than any former author who had borrowed from them, he, in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, gave the public three more of that kind, viz.<LIST>

<ITEM>2. Squire Treelooby, from his Mon&s;ieur do Pourceaugnac.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>However well executed the&s;e pieces were, yet they came to the ear in the &s;ame undi&s;tingui&s;hed utterance, by which almo&s;t all their plays had e|qually &s;uffered; for as few could plainly hear, it was not likely a great many would applaud.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation it appears, that nothing but the union of the two companies could re&s;tore the &s;tage to its former reputation.</P>
<P>Sir John Vanbrugh therefore, tired of thea|trical management, thought of di&s;po&s;ing of his whole farm to &s;ome indu&s;trious tenant, that might put it into better condition. It was to Mr. Owen Swiny, that in the exigence of his affairs, he made an offer of his actors under &s;uch agreements of
<PB N="109" REF="112">
&s;alary as might be made with them; and of his hou&s;e, cloaths, and &s;cenes, with the Queen's li|cen&s;e to employ them, upon payment of the ca|&s;ual rent of five pounds every acting day, and not to exceed 700 l. per annum. With this propo&s;al Mr. Swiny complied, and governed that &s;tage till another great theatrical revolution.</P>
<P>There are two plays of our author not yet mentioned, viz. The Fal&s;e Friend, a Comedy; acted in 1698, and A Journey to London, a Comedy; which he left unfini&s;hed. This la&s;t piece was fini&s;hed by Mr. Cibber to a very great advantage, and now is one of the be&s;t co|medies in our language. Mr. Cibber, in his pro|logue, takes particular notice of our author's vir|tucus intention in compo&s;ing this piece, which, he &s;ays, was to make &s;ome amends for tho&s;e loo&s;e &s;cenes, which in the fire of his youth he had with more regard to applau&s;e, than virtue, exhibited to the public: but this de&s;ign will be be&s;t under&s;tood by in&s;erting the prologue.<Q><LG>

<L>From prai&s;e of hands, no &s;ure account he draws,</L>

<P>Sir John indeed appears to have been oft|en &s;en&s;ible of the immorality of his &s;cenes; for in the year 1725 when the company of comedians was called upon, in a manner that could not be re&s;i&s;ted, to revive the Pro|vok'd Wife, the author, who was con&s;cious how ju&s;tly it was expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure, thought proper to &s;ub&s;titute a new &s;cene in the fourth act, in place of another, in which, in the wantonne&s;s of his wit and humour, he had made a Rake talk like a Rake, in the habit of a Clergyman. To avoid which of|fence, he put the &s;ame Debauchee into the Un|dre&s;s of a Woman of Quality; for the cha|racter of a fine lady, it &s;eems, is not reckon|ed &s;o indelibly &s;acred, as that of a Church|man. Whatever follies he expo&s;ed in the pet|ticoat kept him at lea&s;t clear of his former im|puted
<PB N="111" REF="114">
prophanene&s;s, and appeared now to the audience innocently ridiculous.</P>
<P>This ingenious dramati&s;t died of a quin&s;ey at his hou&s;e in Whitehall, on the 26th of March 1726. He was a man of a lively imagination, of a facetious, and engaging humour, and as he lived e&s;teemed by all his acquaintance, &s;o he died without leaving one enemy to reproach his memory; a felicity which few men of public employments, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a genius, ever enjoyed. He has left behind him monuments of fame, which can never peri&s;h but with ta&s;te and politene&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Sir RICHARD STEELE, Knt.</HEAD>
<P>THIS celebrated genius was born in Ireland. His father being a coun&s;ellor at law, and private &s;ecretary to James duke of Ormond, he went over with his grace to that kingdom, when he was rai&s;ed to the dignity of lord lieutenant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Dictionary, vol. ix. p. 395.</NOTE>. Our author when but very young, came over into England; and was educated at the Charter-Hou&s;e &s;chool in London, where Mr. Addi&s;on was his &s;chool-fellow, and where they contracted a friend|&s;hip which continued firm till the death of that great man.</P>
<P>His inclination leading him to the army, he rode for &s;ome time privately in the guards; in which &s;tation, as he him&s;elf tells us, in his Apology for his Writings, he fir&s;t became an author, a way of life in which the irregularities of youth are con&s;ider|ed as a kind of recommendation.</P>
<P>Mr. Steele was born with the mo&s;t violent pro|pen&s;ion to plea&s;ure, and at the &s;ame time was ma&s;ter of &s;o much good &s;en&s;e, as to be able to di&s;cern the extreme folly of licentious cour&s;es, their moral un|fitne&s;s, and the many calamities they naturally pro|duce. He manintained a perpetual &s;truggle between rea&s;on and appetite. He frequently fell into indul|gencies, which co&s;t him many a pang of remor&s;e, and under the conviction of the danger of a vicious life, he wrote his Chri&s;tian Hero, with a de&s;ign to
<PB N="113" REF="116">
fix upon his own mind a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of virtue and religion. But this &s;ecret admonition to his con&s;cience he judged too weak, and therefore in the year 1701 printed the book with his name pre|fixed, in hopes that a &s;tanding evidence again&s;t him|&s;elf in the eyes of the world, might the more forci|bly induce him to lay a re&s;traint upon his de&s;ires, and make him a&s;hamed of vice, &s;o contrary to his own &s;en&s;e and conviction.</P>
<P>This piece was the fir&s;t of any note, and is e&s;teem'd by &s;ome as one of the be&s;t of Mr. Steele's works; he gained great reputation by it, and recommended him&s;elf to the regard of all pious and good men. But while he grew in the e&s;teem of the religious and worthy, he &s;unk in the opinion of his old com|panions in gaiety: He was reckoned by them to have degenerated from the gay, &s;prightly compa|nion, to the dull di&s;agreeable pedant, and they mea|&s;ured the lea&s;t levity of his words and actions with the character of a Chri&s;tian Hero. Thus he found him&s;elf &s;lighted, in&s;tead of being encouraged for his declarations as to religion; but happily tho&s;e who held him in contempt for his defence of piety and goodne&s;s were characters, with whom to be at variance is virtue. But Mr. Steele, who could not be content with the &s;uffrage of the Good only, without the concurrence of the Gay, &s;et about recovering the favour of the latter by innocent means: He introduced a Comedy on the &s;tage, called Grief A-la-Mode, in which, tho' full of incidents that move laughter, and in&s;pire chearfulne&s;s, virtue and vice appear ju&s;t as they ought to do. This play was acted at the Theatre in Drury Lane 1702, and as nothing can make the town &s;o fond of a man, as a &s;ucce&s;sful play; &s;o this, with &s;ome other particulars enlarged on to his advantage, recommended him to king William, and his name to be provided for was in the la&s;t table-book worn by his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="117">
He had before this time procured a captain's commi&s;&s;ion in the lord Lucas's regiment, by the in|tere&s;t of lord Cutts, to whom he dedicated his Chri&s;tian Hero, and who likewi&s;e appointed him his &s;ecretary: His next appearance as a writer, was in the office of Gazetteer, in which he ob&s;erves in the &s;ame apology for him&s;elf, he worked faith|fully, according to order, without ever erring again&s;t the rule ob&s;erved by all mini&s;ters, to keep that paper very innocent, and in&s;ipid. The reproaches he heard every Gazette-day again&s;t the writer of it, in&s;pired him with a fortitude of being remark|ably negligent of what people &s;aid, which he did not de&s;erve. In endeavouring to acquire this ne|gligence, he certainly acted a prudent part, and gained the mo&s;t important and leading advantage, with which every author &s;hould &s;et out.</P>
<P>Whoever writes for the public, is &s;ure to draw down envy on him&s;elf from &s;ome quarter or other, and they who are re&s;olved never to be plea&s;ed, con&s;ider him as too a&s;&s;uming, and di&s;cover their re&s;entment by contempt. How mi&s;erable is the &s;tate of an author! It is his misfortune in com|mon with the fair &s;ex,<Q>To plea&s;e too little, or to plea&s;e too much.</Q></P>
<P>If he happens to be a &s;ucce&s;sful writer, his friends who become then proud of his acquaintance, flatter him, and by &s;oothing his vanity teach him to over|rate his importance, and while he gra&s;ps at univer|&s;al &s;ame, he lo&s;es by too vigorous an effort, what he had acquired by diligence and application: If he plea&s;es too little, that is, if his works are not read, he is in a fair way of being a great lo&s;er by his attempt to plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="118">
Mr. Steele &s;till continued to write plays. In the year 1703 his Comedy, entitled the Tender Hu&s;band, or the Accompli&s;hed Fools, was acted at the Theatre in Drury-Lane; as his Comedy of the Lying-Lovers, or the Ladies Friend&s;hip, was like|wi&s;e the year following, both with &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that his reputation was now fully e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the year 1709 he began the Tatler, the fir&s;t of which was publi&s;hed on Tue&s;day April the 12th, and the la&s;t on Tue&s;day January the 2d, 1710-11. This paper greatly increa&s;ing his fame, he was pre|ferred to be one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;tamp office. Upon laying down the Tatler, he &s;et up, in concert with Mr. Addi&s;on, the Spectator, which was continued from March the 1&s;t, 1710-11, to Decem|ber the 6th 1712; and re&s;umed June 18th 1714, and continued till December the 20th, the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>The Guardian was likewi&s;e publi&s;hed by them, in 1713, and in the October of the &s;ame year, Mr. Steele began a political paper, entitled the Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>In the Spectator, Mr. Steele's papers are marked with the letter T. and in them are contained the mo&s;t picture&s;que de&s;criptions of low life, of which he was perfect ma&s;ter. Humour was his talent, though not &s;o much confined to that ca&s;t of writing to be incapable of painting very tender &s;cenes; witne&s;s his Con&s;cious Lovers, which never fails to draw tears; and in &s;ome of his Spectators he has written in &s;o feeling a manner, that none can read them without emotion.</P>
<P>He had a &s;trong inclination to find out the humours of low life, and to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of them. When he was at Edinburgh, as one of the commi&s;&s;ioners on the forfeited e&s;tates, he one day made a very &s;plendid fea&s;t, and while his &s;ervants were &s;urprized at the great prepara|tions,

and were expecting every moment to carry out his invitations to the company for whom they imagined it was prepared, he commanded them to go out to the &s;treet, and pick up whatever beggars, and poor people they &s;aw, and invite them to his hou&s;e: The &s;ervants obeyed, and Sir Richard &s;oon &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of 40 or 50 beggars, to|gether with &s;ome poor decay'd trade&s;men. After dinner he plied them with punch and wine, and when the frolic was ended, he declared, that be|&s;ides the plea&s;ure of feeding &s;o many hungry per|&s;ons, he had learned from them humour enough for a good comedy.</P>
<P>Our author was a man of the highe&s;t benevo|lence; he celebrates a generous action with a warmth that is only peculiar to a good heart; and however he may be blamed for want of oeconomy, &amp;c. yet was he the mo&s;t agreeable, and if we may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t inno|cent rake, that ever trod the rounds of indulgence.</P>

which he &s;et about procuring a &s;eat in Parliament; for which purpo&s;e he re&s;igned his place of commi&s;|&s;ioner of the &s;tamp-office, in June 1713, in a letter to the earl of Oxford, lord high trea&s;urer, and was cho&s;en member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, for the Borough of Stockbridge. But he did not long enjoy his &s;eat in that hou&s;e before he was expelled, on the 18th of March 1713, for writing the Engli&s;hman, being the clo&s;e of the paper &s;o called; and the Cri&s;is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His expul&s;ion was owing to the &s;pleen of the then pre|vailing party; what they de&s;ign'd as a di&s;grace, prov'd an honour to him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1714 he publi&s;hed the Romi&s;h Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of late years, and a paper intitled The Lover; the fir&s;t of which appeared Thur&s;day Fe|bruary 25, 1714, and another intitled the Reader, which began on Thur&s;day April 22, the &s;ame year. In the &s;ixth Number of this la&s;t paper, he gave an account of his de&s;ign of writing the Hi&s;tory of the Duke of Marlborough, from proper materials in his cu&s;tody: the relation to commence from the date of his grace's commi&s;&s;ion, as captain-general, and plenipotentiary; and to end with the expiration of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions. But this noble de&s;ign he lived not to execute, and the materials were after|wards returned to the duche&s;s of Marlborough, who left them to Mr. Mallet, with a hand&s;ome gratuity for the execution of Sir Richard's de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Soon after the acce&s;&s;ion of king George the I&s;t to the throne, Mr. Steele was appointed &s;urveyor of the royal &s;tables at Hampton-Court, and governor of the royal company of Comedians, by a patent, dated January 19, 1714-15. He was likewi&s;e put into the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace for the county of Middle&s;ex; and in April 1715 received the ho|nour of knighthood from his maje&s;ty. In the fir&s;t
<PB N="118" REF="121">
parliament of that king, he was cho&s;en for Borough|brigg in York&s;hire; and after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Re|bellion in the North, was appointed one of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the forfeited e&s;tates in Scotland, where he received from &s;everal of the nobility and gentry of that part of the united kingdom the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of re&s;pect. He contracted a friend&s;hip while in Scotland, with one Hart, a Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter in Edinburgh, whom he after|wards honoured with his corre&s;pondence: This Hart he u&s;ed merrily to &s;tile the Hangman of the Go&s;pel, for though he was a facetious good-natur'd man, yet he had fallen into a peculiar way of preaching what he called the Terrors of the Law, and denounced anathemas from the pulpit without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Sir Richard held frequent conver&s;ations with Hart, and other mini&s;ters, concerning the re|&s;toration of epi&s;copacy, the antient church-govern|ment of that nation, and often ob&s;erved that it was pity, when the two kingdoms were united in lan|guage, in dre&s;s, in politics, and in all e&s;&s;ential points, even in religion, &s;hould yet be divided in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical admini&s;ration, which &s;till &s;erves to maintain a kind of alienation between the people. He found many of the Scots well di&s;po&s;ed towards prelacy; but the generality, who were taught to contemplate the church of England, with as much horror as that of Rome, could not &s;oon be prevailed upon to return to it.</P>
<P>Sir Richard wi&s;hed well to the intere&s;ts of religion, and as he imagined that Union would promote it, he had &s;ome thoughts of propo&s;ing it at court, but the times were unfavourable. The Pre&s;byterians had lately appeared active again&s;t the rebels, and were not to be di&s;obliged; but &s;uch is now the good under&s;tanding between the epi&s;copal and pre&s;byterian parties, that a few conce&s;&s;ions on the one &s;ide, and not many advances on the other, po&s;&s;ibly might produce
<PB N="119" REF="122">
an amicable coalition, as it is chiefly in form, rather than in articles of religion, in which they differ.</P>
<P>In the year 1715 he publi&s;hed an account of the &s;tate of the Roman Catholic Religion throughout the World, tran&s;lated from an Italian manu&s;cript, with a dedication to the Pope, giving him a very particular account of the &s;tate of religion among&s;t the Prote&s;tants, and &s;everal other matters of im|portance, relating to Great-Britain; but this dedi|cation is &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by another very eminent hand, more conver&s;ant in &s;ubjects of that nature than Sir Richard.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year our author publi&s;hed a Letter from the earl of Marr to the king, before his ma|je&s;ty's arrival in England; with &s;ome remarks on my lord's &s;ub&s;equent conduct; and the year follow|ing a &s;econd volume of the Engli&s;hman, and in 1718 an account of a Fi&s;h-Pool, which was a project of his for bringing fi&s;h to market alive, for which he obtained a patent.</P>
<P>In 1719 he publi&s;hed a pamphlet called the Spin&s;ter, and a Letter to the Earl of Oxford, con|cerning the Bill of Peerage, which bill he oppo&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Some time after, he wrote again&s;t the South-Sea-Scheme; his Cri&s;is of po&s;terity; and another piece intitled, A Nation a Family; and on Saturday January the 2d, 1719-20, he began a paper called the Theatre, during the cour&s;e of which his patent of governor of the Royal Company of Comedians, being &s;u&s;pended by his maje&s;ty, he publi&s;hed, The State of the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In the year 1722, he brought his Con&s;cious Lovers on the &s;tage, with prodigious &s;ucce&s;s. This is the la&s;t and mo&s;t fini&s;hed of all Sir Richard's Comedies, and 'tis doubtful if there is upon the &s;tage, any more in&s;tructing; that tends to con|vey a finer moral, or is better conducted in its de&s;ign. We have already ob&s;erved, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible to witne&s;s the tender &s;cenes of this Comedy
<PB N="120" REF="123">
without emotion; that is, no man of feeling and humanity, who has experienced the delicate &s;oli|citudes of love and affection, can do it. Sir Ri|chard has told us, that when one of the players told Mr. Wilks, that there was a General weeping for Indiana; he politely ob&s;erved, that he would not fight the wor&s;e for that; and indeed what a noble &s;chool of morality would the &s;tage be, if all tho&s;e who write for it would ob&s;erve &s;uch delicate cha&s;tity; they would then inforce an honourable and virtuous deportment, by the mo&s;t in&s;inuating and ea&s;y means; they would &s;o allure the audience by the amiable form of goodne&s;s re|pre&s;ented in her native loveline&s;s, that he who could re&s;i&s;t her charms, mu&s;t be &s;omething more than wicked.</P>
<P>When Sir Richard fini&s;hed this Comedy, the parts of Tom and Phillis were not then in it: He read it to Mr. Cibber, who candidly told him, that though he liked his play upon the whole, both in the ca&s;t of the characters and execution of them; yet, that it was rather too grave for an Eng|li&s;h audience, who want generally to laugh at a Comedy, and without which in their opinion, the end is not an&s;wered. Mr. Cibber then propo&s;ed the addition of &s;ome comic characters, with which Sir Richard agreed, and &s;aw the propriety and force of the ob&s;ervation. This comedy (at Sir Richard's re|que&s;t) received many additions from, and were greatly improved by Mr. Cibber.&mdash;Our author dedicated this work to the king, who made him a pre&s;ent of 500l.</P>
<P>Some years before his death, he grew paralytic, and retired to his &s;eat at Langunner, near Caermarthen in Wales, where he died September the 1&s;t, 1729; and was privately interred according to his own de|&s;ire, in the church of Caermarthen.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides his writings above-mentionened, he began on Saturday the 17th of December, a weekly paper in quarto, called the Town-Talk, in a letter to
<PB N="121" REF="124">
a lady in the country; and another, intitled the Tea-Table: He had likewi&s;e planned a comedy which he intended to call The School of Action.&mdash;As Sir Richard was beloved when living, &s;o his lo&s;s was &s;incerely regretted at his death. He was a man of undi&s;&s;embled, and exten&s;ive be|nevolence; a friend to the friendle&s;s, and as far as his circum&s;tances would permit, the father of every orphan: His works are cha&s;te, and man|ly, he him&s;elf admired virtue, and he drew her as lovely as &s;he is: of his works it may be &s;aid, as Sir George Lyttleton in his prologue to Coriola|nus ob&s;erves of Thom&s;on, that there are not in them<Q><L>One corrupted, one immoral thought,</L>
<L>A line which dying he could wi&s;h to blot.</L></Q> He was a &s;tranger to the mo&s;t di&s;tant appearance of envy or malevolence, never jealous of any man's growing reputation, and &s;o far from arrogating any prai&s;e to him&s;elf, from his conjunction with Mr. Addi&s;on, that he was the fir&s;t who de&s;ired him to di&s;tingui&s;h his papers in the Spectator, and af|ter the death of that great man was a faithful ex|ecutor of his fame, notwith&s;tanding an a&s;per&s;ion which Mr. Tickell was &s;o unju&s;t to throw upon him. Sir Richard's greate&s;t error was want of oeco|nomy, as appears from the two following in&s;tances related by the elegant writer of Mr. Savage's Life, to whom that gentleman communicated them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Savage was once de&s;ired by Sir Richard, with an air of the utmo&s;t importance, to come very early to his hou&s;e the next morning. Mr. Savage came as he had promi&s;ed, found the chariot at the door, and Sir Richard waiting for him ready to go out. What was intended, and whither they
<PB N="122" REF="125">
were to go, Savage could not conjecture, and was not willing to inquire; but immediately &s;eated him&s;elf with Sir Richard: The coachman was ordered to drive, and they hurried with the utmo&s;t expedition to Hyde-Park Corner, where they &s;topped at a petty tavern, and retired to a private room. Sir Richard then informed him, that he intended to publi&s;h a pamphlet, and that he de&s;ired him to come thither, that he might write for him. They &s;oon &s;at down to the work, Sir Richard dictated, and Savage wrote, till the dinner which had been ordered, was put upon the table. Savage was &s;urpri&s;ed at the meanne&s;s of the entertainment, and after &s;ome he&s;itation, ventured to a&s;k for wine, which Sir Richard, not without reluctance ordered to be brought. They then fini&s;hed their dinner, and proceeded in their pamphlet, which they concluded in the afternoon. Mr. Savage then imagined his ta&s;k over, and expected that Sir Richard would call for the reckoning and return home; but his expectations deceived him, for Sir Richard told him he was without money and that the pamphlet mu&s;t be &s;old before the dinner could be paid for; and Savage was therefore obliged to go and offer their new production to &s;ale for two guineas, which with &s;ome difficulty he obtained. Sir Richard then returned home, having retired that day only to avoid his creditors, and com|po&s;ed the pamphlet only to di&s;charge his rec|koning.'</Q> As Savage has &s;aid nothing to the contrary, it is rea&s;onable to conjecture that he had Sir Richard's permi&s;&s;ion to u&s;e his name to the Book&s;eller, to whom he made an offer of it for two guineas, otherwi&s;e it is very improbable that the pamphlet &s;hould be &s;old at all in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>The other in&s;tance is equally uncommon with the former;</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="126">
Sir Richard having invited to his hou&s;e a great number of per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality, they were &s;urprized at the number of liveries which &s;urrounded the table; and after dinner, when wine and mirth had &s;et them free from the ob&s;ervation of rigid ceremony, one of them enquired of Sir Richard, how &s;uch an expen&s;ive train of dome&s;tics could be con&s;i&s;tent with his fortune? Sir Richard frankly confe&s;&s;ed, that they were fellows of whom he would very willingly be rid. And being then a&s;ked why he did not di&s;charge them; he declared that they were Bailiffs who had introduced them|&s;elves with an execution, and whom, &s;ince he could not &s;end them away, he had thought it con|venient to imbelli&s;h with liveries, that they might do him credit whil&s;t they &s;taid.</P>
<P>His friends were diverted with the expedient, and by paying the debt, di&s;charged the attendance, having obliged Sir Richard to promi&s;e that they &s;hould never find him again graced with a retinue of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>He married to his fir&s;t wife a gentlewoman of Barbadoes, with whom he had a valuable Planta|tion there on the death of her brother, who was taken by the French at Sea as he was coming to England, and died in France. This wife dying without i&s;&s;ue, he married Mary, the daughter of Jonathan Scurlock of Langunnoc in Carmarthan|&s;hire, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> by whom he had one &s;on, Eugene, who died young: of his two daughters, one only is liv|ing; which lady became &s;ole heire&s;s to a hand&s;ome e&s;tate in Wales. She was married, when young, to the hon. John Trevor, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> one of the judges of the principality of Wales; who &s;ince, by the death of his brother, has taken his &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Lords, as Baron Trevor, &amp;c.</P>

<P>He afterwards pur&s;ued his &s;tudies with the mo&s;t indefatigable application, and in the year 1638, took the degree of bachelor of arts, and the &s;ame year was admitted &s;cholar of the hou&s;e, that is,

<P>Mr. Marvel's fir&s;t appearance in public bu&s;ine&s;s at home, was, in being a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Milton as La|tin &s;ecretary to the Protector. He him&s;elf tells us, in a piece called The Rehear&s;al Tran&s;po&s;ed, that he never had any, not the remote&s;t relation to public matters, nor corre&s;pondence with the per|&s;ons then predominant, until the year 1657, when indeed, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I entered into an employment, for which I was not altogether improper, and which I con&s;idered to be the mo&s;t innocent, and inoffen&s;ive towards his Maje&s;ty's affairs of any in that u&s;urped, and irregular government, to which all men were then expo&s;ed; and this I accordingly di&s;charged, without di&s;obliging any one per&s;on, there having been opportunities, and endeavours &s;ince his Maje&s;ty's happy rerurn, to have di&s;covered, had it been otherwi&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P>A little before the Re&s;toration, he was cho&s;en by his native town, King&s;ton upon Hull, to &s;it in that Parliament which began at We&s;tmin&s;ter April 25, 1660, and again after the Re&s;toration for that which began at the &s;ame place May 8, 1661. In this &s;tation our author di&s;charged his tru&s;t with the utmo&s;t &s;idelity, and always &s;hewed a peculiar re|gard for tho&s;e he repre&s;ented; for he con&s;tantly &s;ent the particulars of every proceeding in the Hou&s;e, to the heads of the town for which he was elected; and to tho&s;e accounts he always joined his own opinion. This re&s;pectful behaviour gain|ed &s;o much on their affections, that they allowed him an honourable pen&s;ion to his death, all which time he continued in Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="131">
Mr. Marvel was not endowed with the gift of elo|quence, for he &s;eldom &s;poke in the hou&s;e; but was however capable of forming an excellent judgment of things, and was &s;o acute a di&s;cerner of cha|racters, that his opinion was greatly valued, and he had a powerful influence over many of the Members without doors. Prince Rupert particu|larly e&s;teemed him, and whenever he voted agree|able to the &s;entiments of Mr. Marvel, it was a &s;aying of the oppo&s;ite party, he has been with his tutor. The intimacy between this illu&s;trious foreigner, and our author was &s;o great, that when it was un&s;afe for the latter to have it known where he lived, on account of &s;ome mi&s;chief which was threatened him, the prince would frequently vi&s;it him in a di&s;gui&s;ed habit. Mr. Marvel was often in &s;uch danger of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, that he was obliged to have his letters directed to him in an|other name, to prevent any di&s;covery that way. He made him&s;elf obnoxious to the government, both by his actions, and writings; and notwith|&s;tanding his proceedings were all contrary to his private intere&s;t, nothing could ever &s;hake his re|&s;olution, of which the following is a notable in&s;tance, and tran&s;mits our author's name with lu&s;tre to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>One night he was entertained by the King, who had often been delighted with his company: his Maje&s;ty next day &s;ent the lord trea&s;urer Danby to find out his lodging; Mr. Marvel, then rent|ed a room up two pair of &s;tairs, in a little court in the Strand, and was writing when the lord trea&s;urer opened the door abruptly upon him. Surprized at the fight of &s;o unexpected a vi&s;itor, Mr. Marvel told his lord&s;hip, that he believed he had mi&s;taken his way; the lord Danby replied, not now I have found Mr. Marvel: telling him that he came with a me&s;&s;age from his Maje&s;ty, which was to know what he could do to &s;erve
<PB N="129" REF="132">
him? his an&s;wer was, in his u&s;ual facetious man|ner, that it was not in his Maje&s;ty's power to &s;erve him: but coming to a &s;erious explanation of his meaning, he told the lord trea&s;urer, that he well knew the nature of courts, and that whoever is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a Prince's favour, is certainly ex|pected to vote in his intere&s;t. The lord Danby told him, that his Maje&s;ty had only a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his merits, in regard to which alone, he de|&s;ired to know whether there was any place at court he could be plea&s;ed with. The&s;e offers, though urged with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, had no effect upon him; he told the lord trea&s;urer, that he could not accept it with honour, for he mu&s;t ei|ther be ungrateful to the King by voting again&s;t him, or betray his country by giving his voice a|gain&s;t its intere&s;t, at lea&s;t what he reckoned &s;o. The only favour therefore which he begged of his Maje&s;ty, was, that he would e&s;teem him as duti|ful a &s;ubject as any he had, and more in his pro|per intere&s;t in rejecting his offers, than if he had embraced them. The lord Danby finding no ar|guments would prevail, told him, the King had ordered a thou&s;and pounds for him, which he hoped he would accept, 'till he could think what farther to a&s;k of his Maje&s;ty. This la&s;t tempta|tion was re&s;i&s;ted with the &s;ame &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of mind as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The reader mu&s;t have already taken notice that Mr. Marvel's chief &s;upport was the pen&s;ion allowed him by his con&s;tituents, that his lodgings were mean, and con&s;equently his circum&s;tances at this time could not be affluent. His re&s;i&s;t|ing the&s;e temptations therefore in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, was perhaps one of the mo&s;t heroic in|&s;tances of patrioti&s;m the Annals of England can fur|ni&s;h. But his conduct will be &s;till heightened into a more amiable light, when it is related, that as &s;oon as the lord trea&s;urer had taken his leave, he

was obliged to &s;end to a friend to borrow a guinea.</P>
<P>As the mo&s;t powerful allurements of riches, and honour, could never &s;educe him to re|linqui&s;h the intere&s;t of his country, &s;o not even the mo&s;t immen&s;e dangers could deter him from pur&s;uing it. In a private letter to a friend from Highgate, in which he mentions the in&s;uperable hatred of his foes to him, and their de&s;ign of murthering him, he has the&s;e words; Praeterea magis occidere metuo quam occidi, non quod vi|tam tanti ae&s;timem, &s;ed ne imparatus moriar, i. e. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Be&s;ides, I am more apprehen&s;ive of killing, than being killed, not that I value life &s;o much, but that I may not die unprepared.'</Q> Mr. Marvel did not remain an unconcerned member of the &s;tate, when he &s;aw encroachments made upon it both by the civil, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers. He &s;aw that &s;ome of the bi&s;hops had formed an idea of prote&s;tanti&s;m very different from the true one, and were making &s;uch advances towards popery, as would &s;oon i&s;&s;ue in a reconciliation. Among&s;t the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tics, none was &s;o forward as Dr. Samuel Parker, who publi&s;hed at London 1672 in 8vo. bi&s;hop Bramhal's Vindication of him&s;elf, and the Epi&s;copal Clergy, from the Pre&s;byterian charge of Popery, as it is managed by Mr. Baxter in his Treati&s;e on the Grotian Religion. Dr. Parker likewi&s;e preached up the doctrine of Non-re&s;i&s;t|ance, which &s;lavi&s;h principle is admirably calcu|lated to prepare the people for receiving any yoke. Marvel, who&s;e talent con&s;i&s;ted in drollery, more than in &s;erious rea&s;oning, took his own me|thod of expo&s;ing tho&s;e opinions. He wrote a piece called The Rehear&s;al Tran&s;po&s;ed, in which he ve|ry &s;ucce&s;sfully ridiculed Dr. Parker. This ludi|crous e&s;&s;ay met with &s;everal an&s;wers, &s;ome &s;eri|ous, and others humorous; we &s;hall not here enu|merate all the Rejoinders, Replies, and Animad|ver&s;ions upon it. Wood him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, who

was an avowed enemy to Marvel, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that Dr. Parker judged it more prudent rather to lay down the cudgels, than to enter the li&s;ts again, with an untowardly combatant, &s;o hugely well ver&s;ed, and experienced, in the then newly refined art of &s;porting, and jeering buffoonery.'</Q> And bi&s;hop Burnet tells us in the Hi&s;tory of his own Time, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That Dr. Parker, after he had for &s;ome years entertained the nation with &s;everal virulent books, was attacked by the livelie&s;t droll of the age, who wrote in a burle&s;que &s;tile, but with &s;o peculiar, and entertaining a conduct, that from the King down to the trade&s;man, his book was read with great plea&s;ure.

<P>The next controver&s;y in which we find Mr. Marvel engaged, was with an antagoni&s;t of the pious Dr. Croft, bi&s;hop of Hereford, who wrote a di&s;cour&s;e entitled The Naked Truth, or A True State of the Primitive Church: By an humble Moderator. Dr. Turner, fellow of St. John's College, wrote Animadver&s;ions upon this book; Mr. Marvel's an&s;wer to the&s;e Animadver&s;ions, was entitled Mr. Smirk, or The Divine in Mode; being certain Annotations upon the Animadver&s;i|ons on The Naked Truth, together with a Short Hi&s;torical E&s;&s;ay concerning General Councils,

<P>Our author's next work was An Account of the Growth of Popery, and Arbitrary Govern|ment in England; more particularly from the long prorogation of November 1675, ending February 15, 1676, 'till the meeting of Parliament July 15, 1677, printed in folio 1678. Our author in a letter dated June 10, 1678, wrote thus; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There came out about Chri&s;tmas la&s;t here, a large book concerning the Growth of Popery, and Arbi|trary Government.

Three or four printed books &s;ince have de&s;crib|ed (as near as was proper to go, the man be|ing a member of Parliament) Mr. Marvel to be the author, but if he had, he &s;urely could not have e&s;caped being que&s;tioned in Parliament, or &s;ome other place.'</Q> This book was &s;o offen&s;ive to the court at that time, that an order was publi&s;hed in the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Whereas there have been lately printed, and publi&s;hed &s;everal &s;editious, and &s;candalous libels again&s;t the proceedings of both Hou&s;es of Par|liament, and other his Maje&s;ty's Courts of Ju&s;tice, to the di&s;honour of his Maje&s;ty's government, and the hazard of the public peace; the&s;e are to give notice, that what per&s;on &s;oever &s;hall di&s;cover un|to one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, the printer, pub|li&s;her, author, or hander to the pre&s;s of any of the &s;aid libels, &s;o that full evidence may be made thereof to a Jury, without mentioning the in|former, e&s;pecially one libel, entitled An Account of the Growth of Popery; and another called A Rea&s;onable Argument to all the Grand Juries, &amp;c. the di&s;coverer &s;hall be rewarded as follows; he &s;hall have fifty pounds for &s;uch di&s;covery as

afore&s;aid, of the printer or publi&s;her of it from the pre&s;s, and for the hander of it to the pre&s;s, one hundred pounds.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Marvel begins this book with a panegyric on the con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h government, &s;hewing how happy the people are under &s;uch whole&s;ome laws, which if faithfully ob&s;erved, mu&s;t make a people happy, and a monarch great. He ob&s;erves, that the king and the &s;ubject are equally under the laws; and that the former is no longer king than he continues to obey them. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'So that, &s;ays he, the kings of England, are in nothing in|ferior to other princes, &s;ave in being more abridg'd from injuring their own &s;ubjects, but have as large a field as any of external felicity, wherein to exerci&s;e their own virtue, and to reward and encourage it in others. In &s;hort there is nothing that comes nearer the divine perfection, than when the monarch, as with us, enjoys a capacity of doing all the good imaginable to mankind, under a di&s;ability of all that is evil.'</Q></P>
<P>After &s;lightly tracing popery from earlier times, he begins with the Dutch war in 1665; but dwells mo&s;t upon the proceedings at Rome, from Novem|ber 1675, to July 1677. He relates the occa&s;ion of the Dutch war, &s;hews that the papi&s;ts, and the French in particular, were the true &s;prings of all our councils; and draws the following picture of popery. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'It is &s;uch a thing, as cannot but for want of a word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\no expre&s;s it, be called a religion; nor is it to be mentioned with that civility, which is other|wi&s;e decent to be u&s;ed in &s;peaking of the differ|ences of human opinions about divine matters; were it either open Juadi&s;m, or plain Turkery, or hone&s;t Pagani&s;m, there is yet a certain Bona

<P>This great man died, not without &s;trong &s;u&s;picions of being poi&s;oned, Augu&s;t 16, 1678, in the 58th year of his age, and was interred in the church of St. Giles's in the Fields; and in the year 1688 the town of King&s;ton upon Hull contributed a &s;um of money to erect a monument over him, in St. Giles's church, for which an epitaph was compo&s;ed by an able hand; but the mini&s;ter of that church, piou&s;ly forbad both the in&s;cription and monument to be placed there.</P>
<P>Mr. Wood tells us, that in his conver&s;ation, he was very mode&s;t, and of few words; and Mr. Cooke ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that he was very re&s;erved among people he did not very well know; but a mo&s;t delightful, and improving companion among&s;t his friends.'</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1680, his mi&s;cellaneous poems were publi&s;hed, to which is prefixed this adverti&s;ement. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The&s;e are to certify every ingenious reader, that all the&s;e poems, as al&s;o the other things in this book contained, are printed according to the exact copies of my late dear hu&s;band, under his own hand writing, both found &s;ince his death, among his other papers.<P>Witne&s;s my hand, MARY MARVEL.</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="138">
But Mr. Cooke informs us, 'that the&s;e were pub|li&s;hed with a mercenary view; and indeed not at all to the honour of the decea&s;ed, by a woman with whom he lodged, who hoped by this &s;tratagem to &s;hare in what he left behind him.'</P>
<P>He was never married, and the &s;ame gentleman ob&s;erves in another place, that in the editions of 1681, there are &s;uch gro&s;s errors, e&s;pecially in the Latin Poems, as make &s;everal lines unintelligible; and that in the volume of Poems on Affairs of State, the &s;ame mi&s;takes are as frequent; and in tho&s;e, &s;ome pieces are attributed to our author, which he never wrote. Mo&s;t of his Poems printed in Dryden's Mi&s;cellanies are &s;o imperfect, that whole &s;tanzas are omitted in many places.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mr. Cooke has re&s;tored in his edition of the works of Andrew Marvel, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> printed at Lon|don 1726, in two volumes, and corrected &s;uch faults as in either of the two former editions ob|&s;cure the &s;en&s;e: in this edition are al&s;o added, &s;ome poems from original manu&s;cripts. Great care has likewi&s;e been taken by Mr. Cooke, to retrench &s;uch pieces as he was &s;ure were not genuine.</P>
<P>Mr. Marvel, con&s;idered as a &s;tate&s;man, makes a more con&s;picuous figure than any of the age in which he lived, the preceeding, or the &s;ub&s;equent: He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t quality of a &s;tate&s;man, that is, inviolable integrity, and a heart &s;o confirmed again&s;t corruption, that neither indigence, a love of pomp, or even dangers the mo&s;t formidable, could move his &s;ettled purpo&s;e, to pur&s;ue in every re&s;pect, the intere&s;t of his country.</P>
<P>That Marvel under&s;tood the true intere&s;t of his country, is abundantly clear, from the great re|verence paid to his opinion, by &s;uch per&s;ons as were mo&s;t able to di&s;cern, and mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to promote its welfare.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="139">
He has &s;ucceeded to a miracle in the droll way of writing; and when he a&s;&s;umes a &s;everity, and writes &s;eriou&s;ly, his arguments and notions are far removed from imbecility.</P>
<P>As a poet, I cannot better delineate his character than in the words of Mr. Cooke, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'There are few of his poems (&s;ays he) that have not &s;omething very plea&s;ing in them, and &s;ome he mu&s;t be al|lowed to have excelled in; mo&s;t of them &s;eem to be the effect of a lively genius, and manly &s;en&s;e, but at the &s;ame time &s;eem to want that correctne&s;s he was capable of making. His mo&s;t fini&s;hed pieces are upon Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, and upon Blood's &s;tealing the crown; the latter of which is very &s;atirical.'<Q><LG>

</LG></Q> <P>'In his &s;tate Poems, is contained much of the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of king Charles the IId, in which time they were all written.

There are &s;ome &s;inall pieces of his in pro&s;e, which ought not to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'I Told you, at our la&s;t meeting, the winter was the fitte&s;t time for bu&s;ine&s;s, and truly I thought &s;o, till my lord trea&s;urer a&s;&s;ured me the &s;pring was the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for &s;allads and &s;ub&s;idies. I hope therefore, that April will not prove &s;o unnatural a month, as not to afford &s;ome kind &s;howers on my parched exchequer, which gapes for want of them. Some of you, perhaps, will think it dangerous to make me too rich; but I do not fear it; for I pro|mi&s;e you faithfully, whatever you give me I will always want; and although in other things my word may be thought a &s;lender authority, yet in that, you may rely on me, I will never break it.</P>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I can bear my &s;traits with patience; but my lord trea&s;urer does prote&s;t to me, that the revenue, as it now &s;tands, will not &s;erve him and me too. One of us mu&s;t &s;uffer for it, if you do not help me. I mu&s;t &s;peak freely to you, I am under bad circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="138" REF="141">
for be&s;ides my harlots in &s;ervice, my Re|formado Concubines lie heavy upon me. I have a pa&s;&s;able good e&s;tate, I confe&s;s, but, God's-fi&s;h, I have a great charge upon't. Here's my lord trea|&s;urer can tell, that all the money de&s;igned for next &s;ummer's guards mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be applyed to the next year's cradles and &s;wadling-cloths. What &s;hall we do for &s;hips then? I hint this only to you, it being your bu&s;ine&s;s, not mine. I know, by ex|perience. I can live without &s;hips. I lived ten years abroad without, and never had my health better in my life; but how you will be without, I leave to your&s;elves to judge, and therefore hint this only by the by: I do not in&s;i&s;t upon it. There's another thing I mu&s;t pre&s;s more earne&s;tly, and that is this: It &s;eems, a good part of my revenue will expire in two or three years, except you will be plea&s;ed to continue it. I have to &s;ay for't; pray why did you give me &s;o much as you have done, unle&s;s you re|&s;olve to give as fa&s;t as I call for it? The nation hates you already for giving &s;o much, and I'll hate you too, if you do not give me more. So that if you &s;tick not to me, you mu&s;t not have a friend in England. On the other hand, if you will give me the revenue I de&s;ire, I &s;hall be able to do tho&s;e things for your religion and liberty, that I have had long in my thoughts, but cannot effect them with|out a little more money to carry me through. Therefore look to't, and take notice, that if you do not make me rich enough to undo you, it &s;hall lie at your doors. For my part, I wa&s;h my hands on't. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nut that I may gain your good opinion, the be&s;t way is to acquaint you what I have done to de|&s;erve it, out of my royal care for your religion and your property. For the fir&s;t, my proclamation is a true picture of my mind. He that cannot, as in a gla&s;s, &s;ee my zeal for the church of England, does not de&s;erve any farther &s;atisfaction, for I declare him willful, abominable, and not good. Some

may, perhaps, be &s;tartled, and cry, how comes this &s;udden change? To which I an&s;wer, I am a changling, and that's &s;ufficient, I think. But to convince men farther, that I mean what I &s;ay, there are the&s;e arguments.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I tell you &s;o, and you know I never break my word.</P>
<P>Secondly, my lord trea&s;urer &s;ays &s;o, and he never told a lye in his life.</P>
<P>Thirdly, my lord Lauderdale will undertake it for me; and I &s;hould be loath, by any act of mine, he &s;hould forfeit the credit he has with you.</P>
<P>If you de&s;ire more in&s;tances of my zeal, I have them for you. For example, I have converted my natural &s;ons from Popery; and I may &s;ay, without vanity, it was my own work, &s;o much the more peculiarly mine than the begetting them. 'Twould do one's heart good to hear how prettily George can read already in the P&s;alter. They are all fine chil|dren, God ble&s;s 'em, and &s;o like me in their under|&s;tandings! But, as I was &s;aying, I have, to plea&s;e you, given a pen&s;ion to your favourite, my lord Lauderdale; not &s;o much that I thought he wanted it, as that you would take it kindly. I have made Carwel duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, and marry'd her &s;i&s;ter to the earl of Pembroke. I have, at my bro|ther's reque&s;t, &s;ent my lord Inchequin into Barbary, to &s;ettle the Prote&s;tant religion among the Moors, and an Engli&s;h intere&s;t at Tangier. I have made Crew bi&s;hop of Durham, and, at the fir&s;t word of my lady Port&s;mouth, Prideaux bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter. I know not, for my part, what factious men would have; but this I am &s;ure of, my predece&s;&s;ors never did any thing like this, to gain the good-will of their &s;ubjects. So much for your religion, and now for

your property. My behaviour to the bankers is a public in&s;tance; and the proceedings between Mrs. Hyde and Mrs. Sutton, for private ones, are &s;uch convincing evidences, that it will be needle&s;s to &s;ay any more to't.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now acquaint you, that, by my lord trea|&s;urer's advice, I made a con&s;iderable retrenchment upon my expences in candles and charcoal, and do not intend to &s;top there, but will, with your help, look into the late embezzlements of my dripping|pans and kitchen&s;tuff; of which, by the way, upon my con&s;cience, neither my lord trea&s;urer, nor my lord Lauderdale, are guilty. I tell you my opinion; but if you &s;hould find them dabling in that bu&s;ine&s;s, I tell you plainly, I leave 'em to you; for, I would have the world to know, I am not a man to be cheated.</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. ELIZABETH THOMAS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS lady, who is known in the world by the poetial name of Corinna, &s;eems to have been born for misfortunes; her very bittere&s;t ene|mies could never brand her with any real crime, and yet her whole life has been one continued &s;cene of mi&s;ery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Memoirs of Mrs. Thomas's Life, prefixed to a volume of Letters between her and Mr. Gwynnet; the only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> that is pre&s;erved concerning her.</NOTE>. The family from which &s;he &s;prung was of a rank in life beneath envy, and above contempt. She was the child of an anci|ent, and infirm parent, who gave her life when he was dying him&s;elf, and to who&s;e unhappy con|&s;titution &s;he was &s;ole heire&s;s. From her very birth, which happened 1675, &s;he was afflicted with fe|vers and defluxions, and being over-nur&s;ed, her con&s;titution was &s;o delicate and tender, that had &s;he not been of a gay di&s;po&s;ition, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a vigorous mind, &s;he mu&s;t have been more unhappy than &s;he actually was. Her fa|ther dying when &s;he was &s;carce two years old, and her mother not knowing his real circum|&s;tances, as he was &s;uppo&s;ed from the &s;plendour of his manner of life to be very rich, &s;ome incon|veniencies were incurred, in be&s;towing upon him a pompous funeral, which in tho&s;e times was
<PB N="147" REF="150">
fa&s;hionable. The mother of our poete&s;s, in the bloom of eighteen, was condemned to the arms of this man, upwards of 60, upon the &s;uppo&s;iti|on of his being wealthy, but in which &s;he was &s;oon mi&s;erably deceived. When the grief, which &s;o young a wife may be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel for an aged hu&s;band, had &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he began to enquire into the &s;tate of his affairs, and found to her un|&s;peakable mortification, that he died not worth one thou&s;and pounds in the world. As Mrs. Tho|mas was a woman of good &s;en&s;e, and a high &s;pirit, &s;he di&s;po&s;ed of two hou&s;es her hu&s;band kept, one in town, the other in the county of E&s;|&s;ex, and retired into a private, but decent coun|try lodging. The chambers in the Temple her hu&s;band po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;old to her brother for 450 l. which, with her hu&s;band's books of accounts, &s;he lodged in her tru&s;tee's hands, who being &s;oon af|ter burnt out by the fire in the paper buildings in the Temple (which broke out with &s;uch vio|lence in the dead of night, that he &s;aved nothing but his life) &s;he lo&s;t con&s;iderably. Not being able to make out any bill, &s;he could form no regu|lar demand, and was obliged to be determined by the honour of her hu&s;band's clients, who, though per&s;ons of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, behaved with very little honour to her. The decea&s;ed had the reputation of a judicious lawyer, and an accompli&s;hed gen|tleman, but who was too hone&s;t to thrive in his profe&s;&s;ion, and had too much humanity ever to be|come rich. Of all his clients, but one lady be|haved with any appearance of hone&s;ty. The coun|te&s;s dowager of Wentworth having then lo&s;t her only daughter the lady Harriot (who was reputed the mi&s;tre&s;s of the duke of Monmouth) told Mrs. Thomas, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that &s;he knew &s;he had a large reckoning with the decea&s;ed, but, &s;ays &s;he, as you know not what to demand, &s;o I know not what to pay; come, madam, I will do better for you than a
<PB N="148" REF="151">
random reckoning, I have now no child, and have taken a fancy to your daughter; give me the girl, I will breed her as my own, and pro|vide for her as &s;uch when I die.'</Q> The widow thank'd her lady&s;hip, but with a little too much warmth replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'&s;he would not part with her child on any terms;'</Q> which the counte&s;s re&s;ented to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he would never &s;ee her more, and dying in a few years, left 1500 l. per annum inheritance, at Stepney, to her chambermaid.</P>
<P>Thus were misfortunes early entailed upon this lady. A propo&s;al which would have made her opulent for life, was defeated by the unrea&s;on|able fondne&s;s of her mother, who lived to &s;uf|fer its di&s;mal con&s;equences, by ta&s;ting the bittere&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es. We have already ob&s;erved, that Mrs. Thomas thought proper to retire to the coun|try with her daughter. The hou&s;e where &s;he board|ed was an eminent Cloth-worker's in the county of Surry, but the people of the hou&s;e proved ve|ry di&s;agreeable. The lady had no conver&s;ation to divert her; the landlord was an illiterate man, and the re&s;t of the family bruti&s;h, and unmannerly. At la&s;t Mrs. Thomas attracted the notice of Dr. Gly&s;&s;on, who ob&s;erving her at church very &s;plen|didly dre&s;&s;ed, &s;ollicited her acquaintance. He was a valuable piece of antiquity, being then, 1684. in the hundredth year of his age. His per&s;on was tall, his bones very large, his hair like &s;now, a venerable a&s;pect, and a complexion, which might &s;hame the bloom of fifteen. He enjoyed a &s;ound judgment, and a memory &s;o tenacious, and clear, that his company was very engaging. His vi&s;its greatly alleviated the &s;olitude of this lady. The la&s;t vi&s;it he made to Mrs. Thomas, he drew on, with much attention, a pair of rich Spa|ni&s;h leather gloves, embo&s;t on the backs, and tops with gold embroidery, and fringed round with gold plate. The lady could not help expre&s;&s;ing her
<PB N="149" REF="152">
curio&s;ity, to know the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e gloves, which he &s;eemed to touch with &s;o much re&s;pect. He an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I do re&s;pect them, for the la&s;t time I had the honour of approaching my mi|&s;tre&s;s, Queen Elizabeth, &s;he pulled them from her own Royal hands, &s;aying, here Gly&s;&s;on, wear them for my &s;ake. I have done &s;o with venera|tion, and never drew them on, but when I had a mind to honour tho&s;e whom I vi&s;it, as I now do you; and &s;ince you love the memory of my Royal mi&s;tre&s;s, take them, and pre&s;erve them carefully when I am gone.'</Q> The Dr. then went home, and died in a few days.</P>
<P>This gentleman's death left her again without a companion, and an unea&s;ine&s;s hung upon her, vi&s;ible to the people of the hou&s;e; who gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e to proceed from &s;olitude, recommended to her acquaint|ance another Phy&s;ician, of a different ca&s;t from the former. He was denominated by them a conjurer, and was &s;aid to be capable of rai&s;ing the devil. This circum&s;tance diverted Mrs. Thomas, who imagin|ed, that the man whom they called a conjurer, mu&s;t have more &s;en&s;e than they under&s;tood. The Dr. was invited to vi&s;it her, and appeared in a grea&s;y black Grogram, which he called his Scho|lar's Coat, a long beard, and other marks of a philo&s;ophical negligence. He brought all his little mathematical trinkets, and played over his tricks for the diver&s;ion of the lady, whom, by a private whi&s;pher, he let into the &s;ecrets as he performed them, that &s;he might &s;ee there was nothing of magic in the ca&s;e. The two mo&s;t remarkable articles of his performance were, fir&s;t lighting a candle at a gla&s;s of cold water (performed by touching the brim before with pho&s;phorus, a chymical fire which is pre&s;erved in water and burns there) and next reading the &s;malle&s;t print by a candle of &s;ix in the pound, at a hundred yards di&s;tance in the open air, and darke&s;t night. This
<PB N="150" REF="153">
was performed by a large concave-gla&s;s, with a deep pointed focus, quick-&s;ilvered on the back|&s;ide, and &s;et in tin, with a &s;ocket for a candle, &s;conce fa&s;hion, and hung up again&s;t a wall. While the flame of the candle was diametrically oppo&s;ite to the centre, the rays equally diverging, gave &s;o powerful a light as is &s;carce credible; but on the lea&s;t variation from the focus, the charm cea&s;ed. The lady di&s;cerning in this man a genius which might be improved to better pur|po&s;es than deceiving the country people, de&s;ired him not to hide his talents, but to pu&s;h him&s;elf in the world by the abilities of which he &s;eemed po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Madam, &s;aid he, I am now a fiddle to a&s;&s;es, but I am fini&s;hing a great work which will make tho&s;e a&s;&s;es fiddle to me.'</Q> She then a&s;ked what that work might be? He replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'his life was at &s;take if it took air, but he found her a lady of &s;uch uncommon candour, and good &s;en&s;e, that he &s;hould make no difficulty in com|mitting his life and hope to her keeping.'</Q> All women are naturally fond of being tru&s;ted with &s;ecrets; this was Mrs. Thomas's failing: the Dr. found it out, and made her pay dear for her cu|rio&s;ity. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have been, continued he, many years in &s;earch of the Philo&s;opher's Stone, and long ma&s;ter of the &s;maragdine-table of Hermes Tri&s;|megi&s;tus; the green and red dragons of Raymond Lully have al&s;o been obedient to me, and the illu&s;trious &s;ages them&s;elves deign to vi&s;it me; yet is it but &s;ince I had the honour to be known to your lady&s;hip, that I have been &s;o fortunate as to obtain the grand &s;ecret of projection. I tran&s;muted &s;ome lead I pulled off my window la&s;t night into this bit of gold.'</Q> Plea&s;ed with the &s;ight of this, and having a natural propen&s;ion to the &s;tudy, the lady &s;natched it out of the philo|&s;opher's hand, and a&s;ked him why he had not made more? He replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'it was all the lead I could
<PB N="151" REF="154">
find.'</Q> She then commanded her daughter to bring a parcel of lead which lay in the clo&s;et, and giving it to the Chymi&s;t, de&s;ired him to tran&s;|mute it into gold on the morrow. He undertook it, and the next day brought her an ingot which weighed two ounces, which with the utmo&s;t &s;o|lemnity he avowed was the very individual lead &s;he gave him, tran&s;muted to gold.</P>
<P>She began now to engage him in &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e; and finding by his replies, that he wanted money to make more powder, &s;he enquired how much would make a &s;tock that would maintain it&s;elf? He replied, one fifty pounds after nine months would produce a million. She then begged the ingot of him, which he prote&s;ted had been tran&s;|muted from lead, and flu&s;hed with the hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, hurried to town to examine whether the ingot was true gold, which proved fine beyond the &s;tandard. The lady now fully convinced of the truth of the empyric's declaration, took fifty pounds out of the hands of a Banker, and entru&s;ted him with it.</P>
<P>The only difficulty which remained, was, how to carry on the work without &s;u&s;picion, it being &s;trictly prohibited at that time. He was there|fore re&s;olved to take a little hou&s;e in another county, at a few miles di&s;tance from London, where he was to build a public laboratory, as a profe&s;&s;ed Chymi&s;t, and deal in &s;uch medi|cines as were mo&s;t vendible, by the &s;ale of which to the apothecaries, the expence of the hou&s;e was to be defrayed during the operation. The widow was accounted the hou&s;ekeeper, and the Dr. and his man boarded with her; to which &s;he added this precaution, that the laboratory, with the two lodging rooms over it, in which the Dr. and his man lay, was a different wing of the building from that where &s;he and her little daughter, and maid-&s;ervant re&s;ided; and as &s;he knew &s;ome time
<PB N="152" REF="155">
mu&s;t elap&s;e before any profit could be expected, &s;he managed with the utmo&s;t frugality. The Dr. mean time acted the part of a tutor to mi&s;s, in Arithmetic, Latin, and Mathematics, to which &s;he di&s;covered the &s;tronge&s;t propen&s;ity. All things be|ing properly di&s;po&s;ed for the grand operation, the vitriol furnace was &s;et to work, which requiring the mo&s;t inten&s;e heat for &s;everal days, unhappily &s;et fire to the hou&s;e; the &s;tairs were con&s;umed in an in&s;tant, and as it &s;urprized them all in their fir&s;t &s;leep, it was a happy circum&s;tance that no life peri&s;hed. This unlucky accident was 300 l. lo&s;s to Mrs. Thomas: yet &s;till the grand project was in a fair way of &s;ucceeding in the other wing of the building. But one misfortune is often fol|lowed by another. The next Sunday evening, while &s;he was reading to, and in&s;tructing her little family, a &s;udden, and a violent report, like a di&s;|charge of cannon was heard; the hou&s;e being tim|ber, rocked like a cradle, and the family were all thrown from their chairs on the ground. They looked with the greate&s;t amazement on each o|ther, not gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e, when the operator pre|tending to revive, fell to &s;tamping, tearing his hair, and raving like a madman, crying out un|done, undone, lo&s;t and undone for ever. He ran directly to the Athanor, when unlocking the door, he found the machine &s;plit quite in two, the eggs broke, and that precious amalgamum which they contained was &s;cattered like &s;and among the a&s;hes. Mrs. Thomas's eyes were now &s;ufficiently opened to di&s;cern the impo&s;ture, and, with a very &s;erene countenance, told the empyric, that accidents will happen, but means might be fallen upon to repair this fatal di&s;appointment. The Dr. ob&s;erving her &s;o &s;erene, imagined &s;he would grant him more money to compleat his &s;cheme, but &s;he &s;oon di&s;|appointed his expectation, by ordering him to be gone, and made him a pre&s;ent of five guiueas,
<PB N="153" REF="156">
le&s;t his de&s;perate circum&s;tances &s;hould induce him to take &s;ome violent means of providing for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Whether deluded by a real hope of finding out the Philo&s;opher's Stone, or from an innate princi|ple of villainy, cannot be determined, but he did not yet cea&s;e his pur&s;uit, and &s;till indulged the golden delu&s;ion. He now found means to work upon the credulity of an old mi&s;er, who, upon the &s;trenght of his preten&s;ions, gave him his daughter in marriage, and embarked all his hoarded trea&s;ure, which was very con&s;iderable, in the &s;ame chimerical adventure. In a word, the mi&s;er's &s;tock was al&s;o lo&s;t, the empyric him&s;elf, and the daughter reduced to beggary. This unhappy affair broke the mi&s;er's heart, who did not many weeks &s;ur|vive the lo&s;s of his ca&s;h. The Dr. al&s;o put a mi&s;erable end to his life by drinking poi&s;on, and left his wife with two young children in a &s;tate of beggary. But to return to Mrs. Thomas.</P>
<P>The poor lady &s;uffered on this occa&s;ion a great deal of inward angui&s;h; &s;he was a&s;hamed of hav|ing reduced her fortune, and impoveri&s;hed her child by li&s;tening to the in&s;inuations of a mad|man. Time and patience at la&s;t overcame it; and when her health, which by this accident had been impaired, was re&s;tored to her, &s;he began to &s;tir among&s;t her hu&s;band's great clients. She took a hou&s;e in Bloom&s;bury, and by means of good oeconomy, and an elegant appearance, was &s;up|po&s;ed to be better in the world than &s;he really was. Her hu&s;band's clients received her like one ri&s;en from the dead: They came to vi&s;it her, and pro|mi&s;ed to &s;erve her. At la&s;t the duke of Montague advi&s;ed her to let lodgings, which way of life &s;he declined, as her talents were not &s;uited for dealing with ordinary lodgers; but added &s;he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'if I knew any family who de&s;ired &s;uch a conveniency, I would readily accommodate them.'</Q> I take you at your word, replied the duke, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I will become

your &s;ole tenant: Nay don't &s;mile, for I am in earne&s;t, I love a little freedom more than I can enjoy at home, and I may come &s;ome|times and eat a bit of mutton, with four or five hore&s;t fellows, who&s;e company I delight in.'</Q> The bargain was bound, and proved matter of fact, though on a deeper &s;cheme than drinking a bottle: And his lord&s;hip was to pa&s;s in the hou&s;c for Mr. Freeman of Hertford&s;hire.</P>
<P>In a few days he ordered a dinner for his be|loved &s;riends, Jack and Tom, Will and Ned, good hone&s;t country-fellows, as his grace called them. They came at the time appointed; but how &s;urprized was the widow, when &s;he &s;aw the duke of Devon&s;hire, the lords Buckingham, and Dor&s;et, and a certain vi&s;count, with Sir William Dutton Colt, under the&s;e feign'd names. After &s;everal times meeting at this lady's hou&s;e, the no|ble per&s;ons, who had a high opinion of her in|tegrity, entru&s;ted her with the grand &s;ecret, which was nothing le&s;s than the project for the Revolu|tion.</P>
<P>Tho' the&s;e meetings were held as private as po&s;&s;ible, yet &s;u&s;picions aro&s;e, and Mrs. Thomas's hou&s;e was narrowly watched; but the me&s;&s;engers, who were no enemies to the cau&s;e, betrayed their tru&s;t, and &s;uffered the noblemen to meet unmo|le&s;ted, or at lea&s;t without any dread of apprehen|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Revolution being effected, and the &s;tate eame more &s;ettled, that place of ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">vous was quitted: The noblemen took leave of the lady, with promi&s;es of obtaining a pen&s;ion, or &s;ome place in the hou&s;hold for her, as her zeal in that cau&s;e highly merited; be&s;ides &s;he had a very good claim to &s;ome appointment, having been ruined by &s;hutting up the Exchequer. But alas! court promi&s;es proved an aerial foundation, and the&s;e noble peers never thought of her more. The duke
<PB N="155" REF="158">
of Montague indeed made offers of &s;ervice, and being captain of the band of pen&s;ioners, &s;he a&s;ked him to admit Mr. Gwynnet, a gentleman who had made love to her daughter, into &s;uch a po&s;t. This he promi&s;ed, but upon the&s;e terms, that her daughter &s;hould a&s;k him for it. The widow thanked him, and not &s;u&s;pecting that any de&s;ign was covered under this offer, concluded her&s;elf &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s: But how amazed was &s;he to find her daughter (whom &s;he had bred in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjection) and who had never di&s;covered the lea&s;t in&s;tance of di&s;obedience, ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to a&s;k any &s;uch favour of his grace. She could be pre|va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nled upon neither by flattery, nor threatning, and continuing &s;till ob&s;tinate in her re&s;olution; her mo|ther obliged her to explain her&s;elf, upon the point of her refu&s;al.

<P>Our amiable poete&s;s, in a letter to Dr. Talbot, Bi&s;hop of Durham, has given &s;ome farther particu|lars of her life. We have already &s;een that &s;he was addre&s;&s;ed upon honourable terms, by Mr. Gwynnet, of the Middle Temple, &s;on of a gentleman in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire. Upon his fir&s;t di&s;covering his pa&s;|&s;ion to Corinna, &s;he had honour enough to remon|&s;trate to him the inequality of their fortune, as her affairs were then in a very perplexed &s;ituation. This objection was &s;oon &s;urmounted by a lover, e&s;peci|ally as his father had given him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of his e&s;tate, and leave to plea&s;e him|&s;elf. Mr. Gwynnet no &s;ooner obtained this, than he came to London, and claimed Corinna's promi&s;e of marriage: But her mother being then in a very weak
<PB N="157" REF="160">
condition, &s;he could not abandon her in that di&s;|tre&s;s, to die among &s;trangers. She therefore told Mr. Gwynnet, that as &s;he had not thought &s;ixteen years long in waiting for him, he could not think &s;ix months long in expectation of her. He replied, with a deep &s;igh, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Six months at this time, my Corinna, is more than &s;ixteen years have been; you put it off now, and God will put it off for ever.'</Q>&mdash;It proved as he had foretold; he next day went into the country, made his will, &s;ickened, and died April the 16th, 1711, leaving his Corinna the beque&s;t of &s;ix-hundred pounds; and adds &s;he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sorrow has been my food ever &s;ince.'</Q></P>
<P>Had &s;he providentially married him, &s;he had been &s;ecure from the in&s;ults of poverty; but her duty to her parent was more prevalent than con&s;idera|tions of convenience. After the death of her lover, &s;he was barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed: His brother, &s;tifled the will, which compelled her to have re|cour&s;e to law; he &s;mothered the old gentle|man's conveyance deed, by which he was en|abled to make a beque&s;t, and offered a large &s;um of money to any per&s;on, who would undertake to blacken Corinna's character; but wicked as the world is, he found none &s;o compleatly abandoned, as to perjure them&s;elves for the &s;ake of his bribe. At la&s;t to &s;hew her re&s;pect to the memory of her decea&s;ed lover, &s;he con&s;ented to an accom|modation with his brother, to receive 2001. down, and 2001. at the year's end. The fir&s;t payment was made, and di&s;tributed in&s;tantly among&s;t her mother's creditors; but when the other became due, he bid her defiance, &s;tood &s;uit on his own bond, and held out four terms. He carried it from one court to another, till at la&s;t it was brought to the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords; and as that is a tribunal, where the chicanery of lawyers can have no weight, he thought proper to pay the money without a hearing. The gentlemen of the long|robe
<PB N="158" REF="161">
had made her &s;ign an in&s;trument, that they &s;hould receive the money and pay them&s;elves: After they had laid their cruel hands upon it, of the 2001. the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed lady received but 131. 16s. which reduced her to the nece&s;&s;ity of ab&s;conding from her creditors, and &s;tarving in an ob&s;cure cor|ner, till &s;he was betrayed by a fal&s;e friend, and hurried to jail.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the other calamities of Corinna, &s;he had ever a bad &s;tate of health, occa&s;ioned by an accident too curious to be omitted.</P>
<P>In the year 1730 her ca&s;e was given into the college of phy&s;icians, and was reckoned a very &s;ur|prizing one. It is as follows. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'In April 1711 the patient &s;wallowed the mid|dle bone of the wing of a large fowl, being above three inches long; &s;he had the end in her mouth, and &s;peaking ha&s;tily it went forcibly down in the act of in&s;piration. After the fir&s;t &s;urprize, feel|ing no pain &s;he thought no more of it; in a few days after, &s;he complained what &s;he eat or drank lay like a &s;tone in her &s;tomach, and little or no|thing pa&s;s'd through her. After three weeks ob|&s;truction, &s;he fell into a mo&s;t violent bloody flux, attended with a continual pain at the pit of her &s;tomach, convul&s;ions, and &s;wooning fits nor had &s;he any ea&s;e but while her &s;tomach was di&s;tended with liquids, &s;uch as &s;mall beer, or gruel: She continued in this mi&s;ery, with &s;ome little intervals, till the Chri&s;tma&s;s following, when &s;he was &s;eized with a malignant fever, and the convul&s;ions en|crea&s;ed to &s;o high a degree, that &s;he crowed like a cock, and barked like a dog, to the affright|ment of all who &s;aw her, as well as her&s;elf. Dr. Colebatch being called to her relief, and &s;eeing the almo&s;t incredible quantity of blood &s;he voided, &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could live, having voided
<PB N="159" REF="162">
all her bowels. He was however prevailed with to u&s;e means, which he &s;aid could only be by fetching off the inner coat of her &s;tomach, by a very &s;trong vomit; he did &s;o, and &s;he brought the hair-veel in rolls, fre&s;h and bleeding; this di&s;lodged the bone, which &s;plit length ways, one half pa&s;s'd off by &s;iege, black as jet, the cartila|ginous part at each end con&s;umed, and &s;harp on each &s;ide as a razor; the other part is &s;till lodged within her. In this raw and extream weak con|dition, he put her into a &s;alivation, unknown to her mother or her&s;elf, to carry off the other part, which &s;hocked them to &s;uch a degree, that they &s;ent for Dr. Garth, who with much difficulty, and again&s;t his judgment, was prevailed on to take it off, and u&s;ing a healing galenical method, &s;he began to recover &s;o much &s;trength as to be turned in her bed, and receive nouri&s;hment: But &s;he &s;oon after was &s;eized with the Iliac Pa&s;&s;ion, and for eleven days, her excrements came up|wards, and no pa&s;&s;age could be forced through her, till one day by Dr. Garth, with quick-&s;ilver. After a few weeks it returned again, and the &s;ame medicine repeated, upon which &s;he recovered, and for &s;ome months was brought to be in a tole|rable &s;tate of health, only the region of the &s;pleen much &s;welled; and at &s;ome times, when the the bone moved outwards, as it vi&s;ibly did to &s;ight and touch, was very painful&mdash;In July 1713, on taking too &s;trong a purge, a large impo&s;t|hume bag came away by &s;tool, on which it was &s;uppo&s;ed, the cy&s;tus, which the bone had worked for it&s;elf, being come away, the bone was voided al&s;o; but her pains continued &s;o extraordinary, &s;he willingly &s;ubmitted to the decree of four &s;urgeons, who agreed to make an inci&s;ion in the left &s;ide of the abdomen, and extract the bone; but one of the &s;urgeons utterly rejecting the opera|tion, as impracticable, the bone being lodged in
<PB N="160" REF="163">
the colon, &s;ent her to Bath, where &s;he found &s;ome relief by pumping, and continued tolerably well for &s;ome years, even to bear the fatigue of an eight years &s;uit at law, with an unju&s;t executor; &s;ave that in over-walking, and &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he u&s;ed to be pained, but not violent; and once or twice in a year a di&s;charge of clean gall, with &s;ome portions of a &s;kin, like thin kid leather, tinged with gall, which &s;he felt break from the place, and leave her &s;ore within; but the bone never made any attempt out-wards after the fir&s;t three years. Being deprived of a competent for|tune, by cro&s;s accidents, &s;he has &s;uffered all the extremities of a clo&s;e impri&s;onment, if want of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and lying on the boards for two-years may be termed &s;uch, during which time &s;he never felt the bone. But on her recovering liberty, and beginning to u&s;e exerci&s;e, her &s;tomach, and belly, and head &s;welled to a mon&s;trous degree, and &s;he was judged in a gal|loping drop&s;y; but no proper medicines taking place, &s;he was given over as incurable, when nature unexpectedly helped it&s;elf, and in twelve hours time by &s;tool, and vomit, &s;he voided about five gallons of dirty looking water, which greatly relieved her for &s;ome days, but gathered again as the &s;welling returned, and always abounded with a hectic, or &s;uffocating a&s;thma in her &s;tomach, and either a canine appetite or loathing. She has lately voided &s;everal extraneous membranes dif|ferent from the former, and &s;o frequent, that it keeps her very low, &s;ome of which &s;he has pre&s;erved in &s;pirits, and humbly implores your honours judgment thereon.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Under all the&s;e calamities, of which the above is a ju&s;t repre&s;entation, did poor Corinna labour; and it is difficult to produce a life crouded with greater evils. The &s;mall fortune which her father left
<PB N="161" REF="164">
her, by the imprudence of her mother, was &s;oon &s;quandered: She no &s;ooner began to ta&s;te of life, than an attempt was made upon her innocence. When &s;he was about being happy in the arms of her amiable lover Mr. Gwynnet, he was &s;natched from her by an immature fate. Among&s;t her other misfortunes, &s;he laboured under the di&s;plea|&s;ure of Mr. Pope, who&s;e poetical maje&s;ty &s;he had innocently offended, and who has taken care to place her in his Dunciad. Mr. Pope had once vouch&s;afed to vi&s;it her, in company with Henry Cromwel, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who&s;e letters by &s;ome accident fell into her hands, with &s;ome of Pope's an&s;wers. As &s;oon as that gentleman died, Mr. Curl found means to wheedle them from her, and immediately commit|ted them to the pre&s;s. This &s;o enraged Pope, that tho' the lady was very little to blame, yet he never forgave her.</P>
<P>Not many months after our poete&s;s had been re|lea&s;ed from her gloomy habitation, &s;he took a &s;mall lodging in Fleet &s;treet, where &s;he died on the 3^d of February 1730, in the 56th year of her age, and was two days after decently interred in the church of St. Bride's.</P>
<P>Corinna, con&s;idered as an authore&s;s, is of the &s;econd rate, &s;he had not &s;o much wit as Mrs. Behn, or Mrs. Manley, nor had &s;o happy a power of in|tellectual painting; but her poetry is &s;oft and deli|cate, her letters &s;prightly and entertaining. Her Poems were publi&s;hed after her death, by Curl; and two volumes of Letters which pa&s;s'd between her and Mr. Gwynnet. We &s;hall &s;elect as a &s;pecimen of her poetry, an Ode addre&s;&s;ed to the duche&s;s of Somer&s;et, on her birth-day.<Q><PB N="162" REF="165">

<HEAD>ELIJAH FENTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS worthy gentleman was born at Shelton, near Newca&s;tle under the Line, in Stafford|&s;hire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jacob. p. 55.</NOTE>. In this county, though there are &s;everal families of the name of Fenton, yet they are all branches from one &s;tock, which is a very antient and opulent family: Our author's mother being immediately de&s;cended from one Mare, an officer in William the Conqueror's army.</P>
<P>Our poet was the younge&s;t of twelve children, and was intended by his parents for the mini&s;try: He was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, where he embraced the principles very oppo&s;ite to the go|vernment, by which he became di&s;qualified for en|tering into holy orders. We find him &s;oon after his quitting the univer&s;ity, &s;ecretary to the earl of Orrery, but how long he remained in that &s;tation we cannot a&s;certain. After he quitted the &s;ervice of this noble peer, it was his cu&s;tom to perform a vi&s;it annually to his elde&s;t brother's hou&s;e in the country, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate of 1000 l. per annum. He was care&s;&s;ed in the country, by all his relations, to whom he endeared him&s;elf, by his affable and gen|teel behaviour. Mr. Fenton was a man of the mo&s;t tender humanity, and di&s;covered it upon every pro|per occa&s;ion: A gentleman re&s;ident in that county, who has tran&s;mitted to us &s;ome account of Mr. Fen|ton,
<PB N="165" REF="168">
has given us the following in&s;tance of his hu|mane di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>He had a great number of &s;i&s;ters, &s;ome of whom were le&s;s happy in their marriages than others; one in particular was expo&s;ed to many misfortunes, by the indi&s;cretion and extravagance of her hu&s;band. It is the cu&s;tom of &s;ome people to make very great di&s;tinctions between their rich and poor relations; Mr. Fenton's brother was of this &s;tamp, and it &s;eems treated his unfortunate &s;i&s;ter with le&s;s ceremony than the re&s;t. One day, while Mr. Fenton, was at his brother's hou&s;e, he ob&s;erved the family going to dinner without this &s;i&s;ter, who was in town, and had as good a right to an invitation, as any of the re&s;t who dined there as a compliment to him. He could not help di&s;covering his di&s;plea&s;ure at &s;o unnatural a di&s;tinction, and would not &s;it down to table till &s;he was &s;ent for, and in con&s;equence of this &s;light &s;hewn her by the re&s;t of the family, Mr. Fenton treated her with more tenderne&s;s and complai&s;ance than any of his &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>Our author carried through life a very fair repu|tation, he was beloved and e&s;teemed by Mr. Pope, who honoured him with a beautiful epitaph. Mr. Fenton after a life of ea&s;e and tranquility, died at Ea&s;t-Hamp&s;tead-Park, near Oakingham, the 13th of July 1730, much regretted by all men of ta&s;te, not being obnoxious to the re&s;entment even of his brother writers.</P>
<P>In the year 1723, Mr. Fenton introduced upon the &s;tage his Tragedy of Mariamne, built upon the &s;tory related of her in the third volume of the Spec|tator, Numb. 171, which the ingenious author col|lected out of Jo&s;ephus. As this &s;tory &s;o fully di&s;plays the nature of the pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y, and di&s;covers &s;o extraordinary a character as that of Herod, we &s;hall here in&s;ert it, after which we &s;hall con&s;ider with what &s;ucce&s;s Mr. Fenton has managed the plot.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="169">
In a former paper, the author having treated the paffion of jealou&s;y in various lights, and marked its progre&s;s through the human mind, concludes his animadver&s;ions with this &s;tory, which he &s;ays may &s;erve as an example to whatever can be &s;aid on that &s;ubject. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Mariamne had all the charms that beauty, birth, wit, and youth could give a woman, and Herod all the love that &s;uch charms are able to rai&s;e in a warm and amorous di&s;po&s;ition. In the mid&s;t of his fondne&s;s for Mariamne, he put her brother to death, as he did her father not many years after. The barbarity of the action was repre|&s;ented to Mark Anthony, who immediately &s;um|moned Herod into Egypt, to an&s;wer for the crime that was laid to his charge. Herod attributed the &s;ummons to Anthony's de&s;ire of Mariamne, whom therefore before his departure, he gave into the cu&s;|tody of his uncle Jo&s;eph, with private orders to put her to death, if any &s;uch violence was offered to him&s;elf. This Jo&s;eph was much delighted with Mariamne's conver&s;ation, and endeavoured with all his art and rhetoric to &s;et out the exce&s;s of Herod's pa&s;&s;ion for her; but when he &s;till found her cold and incredulous, he incon&s;iderately told her, as a certain in&s;tance of her lord's affection, the private orders he had left behind him, which plainly &s;hewed, according to Jo&s;eph's interpreta|tion, that he could neither live nor die without her. This barbarous in&s;tance of a wild unrea&s;on|able pa&s;&s;ion quite put out for a time tho&s;e little remains of affection, &s;he &s;till had for her lord: Her thoughts were &s;o wholly taken up with the cruelty of his orders, that &s;he could not con&s;ider the kindne&s;s which produced them; and there|fore repre&s;ented him in her imagination, rather under the frightful idea of a murderer, than a lover.'</P><P><PB N="167" REF="170">
'Herod was at length acquitted, and di&s;mi&s;s'd by Mark Anthony, when his &s;oul was all in flames for his Mariamne; but before their meeting he was not a little alarmed at the report he had heard of his uncle's conver&s;ation and familiarity with her in his ab&s;ence. This therefore was the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e he entertained her with, in which &s;he found it no ea&s;y matter to quiet his &s;u&s;picions. But at la&s;t he appeared &s;o well &s;atisfied of her innocence; that from reproaches, and wranglings, he fell to tears and embraces. Both of them wept very tenderly at their reconciliation, and Herod pour'd out his whole &s;oul to her in the warme&s;t prote&s;tations of love and con&s;tancy; when amid&s;t all his &s;ighs and langui&s;hings, &s;he a&s;ked him, whether the private orders he left with his uncle Jo&s;eph were an in&s;tance of &s;uch an enflamed affection? The jealous king was immediately roufed at &s;o unexpected a que&s;tion, and concluded his uncle mu&s;t have been too familiar with her, before he would have di&s;covered &s;uch a &s;ecret. In &s;hort he put his uncle to death, and very diffi|cultly prevailed on him&s;elf to &s;pare Mariamne.'</P>
<P>'After this he was forced on a &s;econd journey into Egypt, when he committed his lady to the care of Sohemus, with the &s;ame private orders he had before given his uncle, if any mi&s;chief befel him&s;elf: In the mean time Mariamne had &s;o won upon Sohemus, by her pre&s;ents and obliging be|haviour, that &s;he drew all the &s;ecret from him, with which Herod had entru&s;ted him; &s;o that after his return, when he flew to her, with all the tran&s;ports of joy and love, &s;he received him coldly with &s;ighs and tears, and all the marks of indif|ference and aver&s;ion. This reception &s;o &s;tirred up his indignation, that he had certainly &s;lain her with his own hands, had not he feared he him|&s;elf
<PB N="168" REF="171">
&s;hould become the greater &s;ufferer by it. It was not long after this, when he had another violent return of love upon him; Mariamne was therefore &s;ent for to him, whom he endeavoured to &s;often and reconcile with all po&s;&s;ible conjugal care&s;&s;es, and endearments; but &s;he declined his embraces, and an&s;wered all his fondne&s;s, with bit|ter invectives for the death of her father and her brother.'</P>
<P>'This behaviour &s;o incen&s;ed Herod, that he very hardly refrained from &s;triking her; when in the heat of their quarrel, there came in a witne&s;s, &s;uborned by &s;ome of Mariamne's ene|mies, who accu&s;ed her to the king of a de&s;ign to poi&s;on him. Herod was now prepared to hear any thing in her prejudice, and immediately or|dered her &s;ervant to be &s;tretched upon the rack; who in the extremity of his tortures confe&s;t, that his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es aver&s;ion to the king aro&s;e from &s;omething Sohemus had told her; but as for any de&s;ign of poi&s;oning, he utterly di&s;owned the lea&s;t knowledge of it. This con&s;e&s;&s;ion quickly proved fatal to Sohemus, who now lay under the &s;ame &s;u&s;picions and &s;entence, that Jo&s;eph had before him, on the like occa&s;ion. Nor would Herod re&s;t here; but accu&s;ed her with great vehemence of a de&s;ign upon his life, and by his authority with the judges had her publickly condemned and executed.'</P>
<P>'Herod &s;oon after her decea&s;e grew melancholy and dejected, retiring from the public admini&s;tra|tion of affairs, into a &s;olitary fore&s;t, and there abandoned him&s;elf to all the black con&s;iderations, which naturally ari&s;e from a pa&s;&s;ion made up of love, remor&s;e, pity and de&s;pair. He u&s;ed to rave for his Mariamne, and to call upon her in his di&s;|tracted fits; and in all probability, would have
<PB N="169" REF="172">
&s;oon followed her, had not his thoughts been &s;ea&s;onably called off from &s;o &s;ad an object, by public &s;torms, which at that time very nearly threatened him.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Fenton in the conduct of this de&s;ign, has &s;hewn him&s;elf a very great ma&s;ter of &s;tage propriety. He has &s;oftened the character of Herod, well knowing that &s;o cruel a tyrant as the &s;tory makes him, could not be born upon the Engli&s;h &s;tage. He has altered the character of Sohemus, from an hone&s;t confident, to a crafty enterpri&s;ing &s;tate&s;man, who to rai&s;e his ma&s;ter to the throne of Judea, mur|thered the natural heir. He has introduced in his drama, a character under the name of Salome, the king's &s;i&s;ter, who bore an implacable hatred to Mariamne; and who in league with Sohemus pur|&s;ues her revenge, at no le&s;s a price than that of her brother's and the queen's life.</P>
<P>After the wars, which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Cae&s;ar and Anthony, had &s;ub&s;ided, and the world fell to the &s;hare of the former; Herod is repre&s;ented as having ju&s;t returned from Rome, where, as an ho&s;|tage to the emperor, he has &s;tipulated to &s;end his younger &s;on there, and Flaminius, a noble Roman accompanies him into Jewry, to carry off the young prince. The day in which this dramatic action begins, is upon a grand fe&s;tival, appointed in ho|nour of Herod's &s;afe return from Rome, and be|ing &s;till permitted to enjoy his kingdom. The hard condition of &s;ending the prince to Rome, greatly affects the heart of the queen, whom the poet has drawn a mo&s;t tender mother. This throws a cloud over the ceremony, and furni&s;hes an oppor|tunity for Sohemus and Salome, to &s;et their in|fernal engines at work; who, in conjunction with Sameas the king's cup bearer, contrive to poi&s;on the king and queen at the fea&s;t. But the poi&s;oned cup is fir&s;t ta&s;ted by Hazeroth, a young lord re|lated
<PB N="170" REF="173">
to the queen, and the &s;udden effect which it has upon him di&s;covers the villainy.</P>
<P>The queen's ab&s;ence from the fea&s;t proves a fatal circum&s;tance, and as managed by Sohemus, fixes the appearance of guilt upon her. While Herod was ab&s;ent at Rome, Sohemus made addre&s;&s;es to Ar&s;inoe, a Roman lady, confidant to Mariamne; to whom in the ardour of his pa&s;&s;ion he revealed the &s;ecret entru&s;ted to him by Herod, of putting Mariamne to death, in ca&s;e he by any calamitous accident &s;hould lo&s;e his life. Ar&s;inoe from a mo|tive of affection communicated this to Mariamne; as an in&s;tance of the violent pa&s;&s;ion which Herod had for her. This &s;he did immediately before her departure for Rome, with Flaminius the Roman envoy, who proved to be the lord of her wi&s;hes, whom &s;he imagined to have been killed in fighting again&s;t Mark Anthony. Mariamne thrown into this imminent danger, orders Ar&s;inoe to be intercepted, who&s;e return clears up her innocence, as &s;he de|clares that no corre&s;pondence had ever been carried on between the queen and Sohemus, of whom he was now jealous, as Mariamne had upbraided him with his cruel re&s;olutions of putting her to death, entru&s;ted to that mini&s;ter. Herod is &s;atisfied of her innocence, by the evidence of Ar&s;inoe; but as he had before given the cruel orders for putting the queen to death, &s;he, to prevent the execution of &s;uch barbarity. drank poi&s;on. The Queen is conducted in by the high prie&s;t in the agonies of death, which gives &s;uch a &s;hock to Herod, that not able to &s;urvive her, he dies in the &s;ight of the audience.</P>
<P>Sohemus, who knew what tortures would be re|&s;erved for him, kills him&s;elf, after having &s;acrificed Sameas, by who&s;e treachery the plot was di&s;covered, and who in his falling &s;tabs Salome to the heart, as the la&s;t effort of his revenge.</P>
<P>As the plan of this play is regular, &s;imple, and intere&s;ting, &s;o are the &s;entiments no le&s;s ma&s;terly,

and the characters graphically di&s;tingui&s;hed. It contains likewi&s;e many beautiful &s;trokes of poetry.</P>
<P>When Narbal, a lord of the queen's party, gives an account to Flaminius the Roman general, of the queen's parting with her &s;on; he &s;ays,<Q><L>&mdash;A while &s;he &s;tood,</L>

<P>The character of Sameas the king's cup-bearer, is one of the mo&s;t villainous ever &s;hewn upon a &s;tage; and the poet makes Sohemus, in order to give the audience a true idea of him, and to prepare them for tho&s;e barbarities he is to execute, relate the following in&s;tance of his cruelty.<Q><L>&mdash;Along the &s;hore</L>

<P>Some critics have blamed Mariamne, for yield|ing her affections to Herod, who had embrued his hands in her father and brother's blood; in this perhaps &s;he cannot be ea&s;ily defended, but the poet had a right to repre&s;ent this as he literally found it in hi&s;tory; and being the circum&s;tance upon which all the others depended. Tho' this play is one of the mo&s;t beautiful in our language, yet it is in many places expo&s;ed to ju&s;t critici&s;m; but as it has more beauties chan faults, it would be a kind of violence to candour to &s;hew the blemi&s;hes.</P>

<HEAD>BARTON BOOTH, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>IT is but ju&s;tice to the memory of this great actor to give him a place among the poets, if he had been le&s;s con&s;iderable in that province than he really was; for he appears early to have under&s;tood the Latin cla&s;&s;ics, and to have &s;ucceed|ed in occa&s;ional pieces, and little odes, beyond many per&s;ons of higher name in poetry. Mr. Booth was de&s;cended from a very ancient, and ho|nourable family, originally &s;eated in the County Palatine of Lanca&s;ter. His father, John Booth, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> was a man of great worth and honour; and though his fortune was not very con&s;iderable, he was ex|tremely attentive to the education of his children, of whom Barton (the third) was born in 1681.</P>
<P>When about nine years of age, he was put under the tuition of the famous Dr. Bu&s;by, head-ma&s;ter of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, under whom &s;ome of the able&s;t men have been educated, that in the la&s;t and pre&s;ent age have done honour to the nation. The &s;prightline&s;s of Booth's parts early recommended him to the notice of Dr. Bu&s;|by: he had a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for learning, and a peculiar turn for Latin poetry, and by &s;tudying the be&s;t authors in it, he fixed many of the fine&s;t pa&s;&s;ages &s;o firmly in his memory, that he was a|ble to repeat them with &s;uch propriety, and grace|ful action, with &s;o fine a tone of voice, and pe|culiar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N.B.

empha&s;is, that it was taken notice of by the whole &s;chool.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this happy talent, when, ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of the &s;chool, a Latin play was to be acted, a con&s;iderable part thereof was given to young Booth, who drew by the melody of his voice, and the gracefulne&s;s of his action, the applau&s;e of all the &s;pectators, a circum&s;tance which fir&s;t fired him with theat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nical ambition, much again&s;t the inclination of his father, who intended him for the church, and was therefore careful of his education. This propen&s;ion in our young Ro&s;cius, recommended him &s;till more to the favour of Dr. Bu&s;by, who be&s;towed the mo&s;t lavi&s;h encomiums upon him: Bu&s;by was him&s;elf a great admirer of theatrical elocution, and admirably fit|ted by nature for the &s;tage; when he was young he obtained great applau&s;e in a part he perform|ed in a play of Cartwright's, and from that mo|ment held theatrical accompli&s;hments in the high|e&s;t e&s;teem.</P>
<P>When Booth had reached the age of eighteen, and the time approached when he was to have been &s;ent to the univer&s;ity, he re&s;olved to run any ri&s;k, rather than enter upon a cour&s;e of life incon|&s;i&s;tent with the liveline&s;s of his temper, and the natural bent of his inclinations. It happened that there was then in London one Mr. A&s;hbury, who had been long ma&s;ter of a company at Dub|lin, with whom young Booth became acquainted, and finding that under his direction there was no danger of his getting a livelihood, he quitted all other views, &s;tole away from &s;chool, and went o|ver to Ireland with Mr. A&s;hbury in 1698<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h &s;tage.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He very &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on the &s;tage at Dublin, where he had great natural advantages over mo&s;t of his cotemporaries, e&s;pecially in tra|gedy;
<PB N="180" REF="183">
he had a grave countenance, a good per&s;on, an air of dignity, a melodious voice, and a very manly action. He &s;poke ju&s;tly, his cadence was grateful to the ear, and his pronunciation was &s;chola&s;tically correct and proper. He &s;o far in&s;i|nuated him&s;elf into the favour of Engli&s;h gentle|men in Ireland, and found his reputation growing to &s;o great a heighth, that he returned home in 1701, to make a trial of his talents on the Briti&s;h &s;tage. He accordingly applied to lord Fitzhard|ing, of the bedchamber to Prince George of Den|mark, and was by him recommended to Mr. Bet|terton, who took him under his care, and gave him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power, of which Mr. Booth greatly profited.</P>
<P>Never were a tutor and pupil better met; the one was capable of giving the be&s;t in&s;tructions in his own performance, and the other had a prompt|ne&s;s of conception, a violent propen&s;ity, and a great genius. The fir&s;t part Booth performed in London was Maximus in Valentinian, a play of Beaumont and Fletcher's originally, but altered, and brought upon the &s;tage by the earl of Ro|che&s;ter. The reception he met with exceeded his warme&s;t hopes, and the favour of the town had a happy effect upon him, in in&s;piring him with a proper degree of confidence without vanity. The Ambitious Step mother, a tragedy written by Mr. Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\ne, in which that author has thrown out more fire, and heat of poetry, than in any other of his plays, was about this time introduced upon the &s;tage; the part of Artaban was a&s;&s;igned to Booth, in which he rai&s;ed his character to &s;uch a heighth, as to be reckoned only &s;econd to his great ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the year 1704 he married Mi&s;s Barkham, daughter to Sir William Barkham of Norfolk, bart. who lived with him &s;ix years, and died with|out i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="184">
In the theatrical revolutions which happened in tho&s;e days, Mr. Booth, notwith&s;tanding his great capacity, and reputation with the town, had ve|ry little &s;hare. He adhered con&s;tantly to Mr. Betterton, while he could be of any &s;ervice to him, and when his tutor retired from the manage|ment of the &s;tage, he tru&s;ted to his merit, and the ta&s;te of the public, in which he was never de|ceived.</P>
<P>Mr. Booth was particularly turned for tragedy, he never could bear tho&s;e parts which had not &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion to in&s;pire him; and Mr. Cibber ob|&s;erves, that he could not &s;o well melt in the lov|er, as rage in the jealous hu&s;band. Othello was his ma&s;ter-piece, but in all his parts he was oft|en &s;ubject to a kind of indolence, which &s;ome people imagined he affected, to &s;hew that even in his lazy fits he was &s;uperior to every body upon the &s;tage; <HI>as if &s;ecure of all beholders hearts, ne|glecting he could take them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dryden's All for Love.</NOTE>. The late ingenious Mr. Whitingham, who perfectly under&s;tood theatri|cal excellence, and who was, beyond any man I ever knew, di&s;tinct, and accurate in his relations of things, often told me, that &s;uch was the dignity of Booth's appearance, &s;uch his theatrical ea&s;e, and gracefulne&s;s, that had he only cro&s;&s;ed the &s;tage without uttering a word, the hou&s;e would be in a roar of applau&s;e.</P>
<P>We come now to that period of time, when Mr. Booth's &s;ole merit rai&s;ed him to the great|e&s;t height, and procured for him that reward he had long de&s;erved. The tragedy of Cato, which had been written in the year 1703, or at lea&s;t four acts of it, was brought upon the &s;tage in 1712, chiefly on a political prin|ciple; the part of Cato was given to Booth, for the managers were very well &s;atis&s;ied that nobody el&s;e could perform it. As party prejudice never ran higher than at that time, the excellency of the
<PB N="182" REF="185">
play was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;urprizing conte&s;ts between both factions, which &s;hould applaud it mo&s;t, &s;o the merit of the actor received the &s;ame marks of approbation, both parties taking care to &s;hew their &s;atisfaction, by be&s;towing upon him mo&s;t liberal pre&s;ents, the particulars of which are already in&s;erted in the life of Addi&s;on. The run of Cato being over at London, the managers thought fit to remove to Oxford in the &s;ummer, where the play met with &s;o extraordinary a recep|tion, that they were forced to open the doors at noon, and the hou&s;e was quite full by one o'clock. The &s;ame re&s;pect was paid it for three days to|gether, and though the univer&s;al applau&s;e it met with at London, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed any thing that had been remembered of that kind, yet the tribute of prai&s;e it received from this famous univer&s;ity, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed even that. Booth, who&s;e reputation was now at its heighth, took the advantage of it, and making his application to lord Bolingbroke, then at the head of the mini&s;try, he procured a new licence, recalling all former ones, and Mr. Booth's name was added to tho&s;e of Cibber, Dogget, and Wilks. Tho' none of the managers had occa&s;ion to be plea&s;ed with this act of ju&s;tice done to Booth's merit, at the expence of, what they deemed, their property, yet none of them carried their re&s;entment &s;o high as Mr. Dogget, who ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to accept of any con|&s;ideration for his &s;hare in the &s;cenes and clothes; this ob&s;tinacy had however no other effect, than de|priving him of his &s;hare, which brought him in 1000 l. a year; though Mr. Cibber informs us, that this was only a pretence, and that the true rea&s;on of quitting the &s;tage, was, his di&s;like to another of the managers, who&s;e humour was be|come in&s;upportable. This per&s;on we conjecture to have been Mr. Wilks, who, according to Cibber's account, was capricious in his temper, though be had otherwi&s;e great merit as a player, and was
<PB N="183" REF="186">
a good man, morally con&s;idered; &s;ome in&s;tances of the genero&s;ity and noble &s;pirit of Wilks, are taken notice of in the life of Farquhar.</P>
<P>A few years after Mr. Booth ro&s;e to the digni|ty of manager, he married the celebrated Mi&s;s Santlowe, who, from her fir&s;t appearance as an actre&s;s in the character of the Fair Quaker of Deal, to the time &s;he quitted the &s;tage, had al|ways received the &s;tronge&s;t marks of public ap|plau&s;e, which were repeated when after a retreat of &s;ome years, &s;he appeared there again. By her prudence in managing the advantages that aro&s;e to her from her reputation as an actre&s;s, and her great diligence in her profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he acquired a con&s;iderable fortune, which was very u&s;eful to Mr. Booth, who, from the natural turn of his temper, though he had a &s;trict regard to ju&s;tice, was not much inclined to &s;aving.</P>
<P>During the few years they lived together, there was the greate&s;t harmony between them, and af|ter the death of Booth, his di&s;con&s;olate widow, who is yet alive, quitted the &s;tage, and devoted her|&s;elf entirely to a private cour&s;e of life. By degrees the health of Mr. Booth began to decline, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to continue to act with &s;o much diligence as u&s;ual, but at whatever time he was able to return to the &s;tage, the town de|mon&s;trated their re&s;pect for him by crowding the hou&s;e. Being attacked by a complication of di&s;|tempers, he paid the debt to nature May 10, 1733. A copy of his Will was printed in the London Magazine for 1733, p. 126, in which we find he te&s;tified his e&s;teem for his wife, to whom he left all his fortune, for rea&s;ons there a&s;&s;igned, which he declared amounted to no more than two thirds of what he had received from her on the day of marriage. His character as an actor, has been celebrated by the be&s;t judges, and was never que|&s;tioned by any.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187">
And here we cannot re&s;i&s;t the opportunity of &s;hewing Mr. Booth in that full, and commanding light in which he is drawn by the late ingenious Aaron Hill, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR>who had long experience in the affairs of the &s;tage, and could well di&s;tingui&s;h the true merits of an actor. His words are, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Two advantages di&s;tingui&s;hed him in the &s;tronge&s;t light from the re&s;t of his fraternity: he had learning to under&s;tand perfectly what it was his part to &s;peak, and judgment to know how far it agreed, or di&s;agreed with his cha|racter. Hence aro&s;e a peculiar grace, which was vi&s;ible to every &s;pectator, though few were at the pains of examining into the cau&s;e of their plea&s;ure. He could &s;often, and &s;lide over, with a kind of elegant negligence, the improprieties in the part he acted, while, on the contrary, he would dwell with energy upon the beauties, as if he exerted a latent &s;pirit which had been kept back for &s;uch an occa&s;ion, that he might alarm, awaken, and tran&s;port in tho&s;e places on|ly, where the dignity of his own good &s;en&s;e could be &s;upported by that of his author. A little reflexion upon this remarkable quality, will teach us to account for that manife&s;t lan|guor which has &s;ometimes been ob&s;erved in his action, and which was generally, though I think fal&s;ly, imputed to the natural indolence of his temper. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, though in the cu&s;tomary round of his bu&s;ine&s;s, he would con|de&s;cend to &s;ome parts in comedy; he &s;eldom ap|peared in any of them with much advantage to his character. The pa&s;&s;ions which he found in comedy, were not &s;trong enough to excite his fire, and what &s;eemed want of qualification, was only the ab&s;ence of impre&s;&s;ion. He had a talent at di&s;covering the pa&s;&s;ions where they lay hid in &s;ome celebrated parts, by the injudi|cious practice of other actors; when he had di&s;|covered,
<PB N="185" REF="188">
he &s;oon grew able to expre&s;s them; and his &s;ecret of his obtaining this great le&s;&s;on of the theatre, was an adaption of his look to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\ns voice, by which artful imitation of nature, the variations in the &s;ound of his words, gave propriety to every change in his countenance, &s;o that it was Mr. Booth's peculiar felicity to be heard and &s;een the &s;ame, whether as the <HI>plea&s;ed,</HI> the <HI>grieved,</HI> the <HI>pitying,</HI> the <HI>reproachful,</HI> or the <HI>angry.</HI> One would be almo&s;t tempted to borrow the aid of a very bold figure, and to expre&s;s this excellence more &s;ignificantly, beg permi&s;&s;ion to affirm, that the blind might have &s;een him in his voice, and the deaf have heard him in his vi&s;age. His ge&s;ture, or as it is commonly called his action, was but the re&s;ult, and ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of his dominion over his voice and countenance; for having by a con|currence of two &s;uch cau&s;es, impre&s;&s;ed his ima|gination with &s;uch a &s;tamp, and &s;pirit of pa&s;|&s;ion, he ever obeyed the impul&s;e by a kind of natural dependency, and relaxed, or braced &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively into all that fine expre&s;&s;ivene&s;s with which he painted what he &s;poke, without re|&s;traint, or affectation.'</P></Q></P>
<P>But it was not only as a player that Mr. Booth excelled; he was a man of letters al&s;o, and an au|thor in more languages than one. He had a ta&s;te for poetry which we have ob&s;erved di&s;covered it|&s;elf when he was very young, in tran&s;lations of &s;ome Odes of Horace; and in his riper years he wrote &s;everal &s;ongs, and other original poems, which did him honour. He was al&s;o the author of a ma&s;que, or dramatic entertainment, called Dido and Aeneas, which was very well received upon the &s;tage, but which however did not excite him to produce any thing of the &s;ame kind after|wards. His ma&s;ter-piece was a Latin in&s;crip|tion to the memory of a celebrated actor, Mr.
<PB N="186" REF="189">
William Smith, one of the greate&s;t men of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and of whom Mr. Booth always &s;poke in raptures. It is a misfortune that we can give no particular account of the per&s;on this excellent in|&s;cription referred to, but it is probable he was of a good family, &s;ince he was a Barri&s;ter at Law of Gray's-Inn, before he quitted that profe&s;&s;ion for the &s;tage.</P>

Such the life and character of Mr. Booth, who de&s;ervedly &s;tood very high in the e&s;teem of mankind, both on account of the plea&s;ure which he gave them, and the native goodne&s;s of heart which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Whether con&s;idered as a private gentleman, a player, a &s;cholar, or a poet, Mr. Booth makes a very great figure, and his extraordinary excellence in his own profe&s;&s;ion, while it renders his memory dear to all men of ta&s;te, will ever &s;ecure him applau&s;e among&s;t tho&s;e happy few, who were born to in&s;truct, to plea&s;e, and reform their countrymen.</P>

<P>Mr. Oldmixon no doubt by this reflexion in&s;inu|ates, that the laurel would have better become his own brows than Eu&s;den's; but it would per|haps have been more decent for him to ac|quie&s;ce in the opinion of the duke of Bucking|ham (Shefileld) who in his Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets thus mentions Eu&s;den.<Q><L>&mdash;In ru&s;h'd Eu&s;den, and cry'd, who &s;hall have it,</L>

<HEAD>The Revd. Mr. LAWRENCE EACHARD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman, who has been more di&s;|tingui&s;hed as an hi&s;torian than a poet, was the &s;on of a clergyman, who by the death of his elder brother, became ma&s;ter of a good e&s;tate in Suffolk.</P>
<P>He received his education at the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, entered into holy-orders, and was pre|&s;ented to the living of Welton and Elkington in Lincoln&s;hire, where he &s;pent above twenty years of his life; and acquired a name by his writings, e&s;|pecially the Hi&s;tory of England. This hi&s;tory was attacked by Dr. Edmund Calamy, in a letter to the author; in which, according to the Dr. the true principles of the Revolution, the Whigs and the Di&s;&s;enters are vindicated; and many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction cleared from Mr. Eachard's a&s;per&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mr. John Oldmixon, who was of very oppo&s;ite principles to Eachard, &s;everely animadverted upon him in his Critical Hi&s;tory of Eng|land, during the reigns of the Stuarts; but as Old|mixon was a hireling, and a man &s;trongly bia&s;&s;ed by party prejudices, little credit is due to his te&s;timony: Which is moreover accompanied with a perpetual torrent of abu&s;e. Mr. Eachard's ge|neral Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, from the nativity of Chri&s;t to the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity by human laws, under the emperor Con&s;tantine the Great, has been much e&s;teemed.</P>

Mr. Oldmixon's next piece was entitled the Grave, or Love's Paradi&s;e; an Opera repre&s;ented at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, 1700.

<P>That this letter could not be written by Mr. Ad|di&s;on, there is all the evidence the nature of the thing will admit, to believe; for fir&s;t, Sir Richard Steele avow'd, it to be his, and in the next place, it is not probable that Mr. Addi&s;on him&s;elf had &s;o high an opinion of this &s;imile, as to call it as great as ever entered into the thought of man; for it has in reality no uncommon greatne&s;s in it. The image occurs a thou&s;and times in the book of P&s;alms: &s;o that it has not novelty to recommend it, and the manner of its being expre&s;&s;ed, is no way extraordi|nary. The high terms in which it is celebrated, is the language of friend&s;hip, not of judgment. It is very probable Sir Richard Steele, warm'd with a fa|vourite &s;ubject, and zealous for the fame of Addi&s;on, might expre&s;s him&s;elf thus hyperbolically concerning it; but Mr. Addi&s;on was too judicious a critic, to think or &s;peak of it in the&s;e terms, and was be&s;ides too cau|tious to run the ri&s;k of doing it him&s;elf in &s;o public a manner. In a word, Mr. Oldmixon was an en|vious man, and we have &s;een with how little ground of re&s;entm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nnt he railed again&s;t Eu&s;den, becau&s;e that gentleman was preferred to the Laurel.</P>
<P>Mr. Oldmixon joined the general cry of the under|ling writers again&s;t Mr. Pope; and wrote many let|ters in the Flying Po&s;t, with an intention to reduce his reputation, with as little &s;ucce&s;s as his other

antagoni&s;ts had done. In his pro&s;e E&s;&s;ay on Criti|ci&s;m, and in the Arts of Logic and Rhetoric, he frequently reflects on Pope, for which he has re|ceived a place in his Dunciad.</P>
<P>When that eminent &s;atyri&s;t in his &s;econd Book, line 270, repre&s;ents the Dunces diving for the Prize of Dulne&s;s, he in a particular manner dignifies Old|mixon, for he makes him climb a lighter, that by leaping from it, he may &s;ink the deeper in the mud.<Q><L>In naked maje&s;ty Oldmixon &s;tands,</L>

<P>Mr. Oldmixon wrote a hi&s;tory of the Stuarts in folio, and a Critical Hi&s;tory of England, in two volumes octavo. The former of the&s;e pieces was undertaken to blacken the family of the Stuarts. The mo&s;t impartial writers and candid critics, on both &s;ides, have held this work in con|tempt, for in every page there breathes a malevolent &s;pirit, a di&s;po&s;ition to rail and calumniate: So far from ob&s;erving that neutrality and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate even|ne&s;s of tempe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n, which &s;hould be carefully attended to by every hi&s;torian, he &s;uffers him&s;elf to be tran|&s;ported with anger: He reviles, wre&s;ts particular pa&s;&s;ages, and frequently dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\ns forced conclu&s;ions. A hi&s;tory written in this &s;pirit has no great claim to a reader's faith. The reigns of the Stuarts in England were no doubt chequer'd with many evils; and yet it is certainly true, that a man

who can &s;it deliberately down to &s;earch for errors only, mu&s;t have a &s;trong propen&s;ion to calumny, or at lea&s;t take delight in triumphing over the weak|ne&s;s of his fellow-creatures, which is &s;urely no in|dication of a good heart.</P>
<P>Mr. Oldmixon, being employ'd by bi&s;hop Kennet. in publi&s;hing the Hi&s;torians in his collection, he I erverted Daniel's Chronicle in numberle&s;s places.

<HEAD>LEONARD WELSTED, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was de&s;cended from a very good family in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and received the rudiments of his education in We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool. We are informed by major Cleland, author of a Panegyric on Mr. Pope, prefixed to the Dunciad, that he was a member of both the univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>In a piece &s;aid to have been written by Mr. Wel|&s;ted, called The Characters of the Times, print|ed in 8vo. 1728, he gives this account of him&s;elf; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Mr. Wel&s;ted had in his youth rai&s;ed &s;o great expectations of his future genius, that there was a kind of &s;truggle between the two univer&s;ities, which &s;hould have the honour of his educa|tion; to compound this, he civilly became a member of both, and after having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at the one, he removed to the other. From thence he returned to town, where he became the darling expectation of all the polite writers, who&s;e encouragement he ac|knowledged in his occa&s;ional poems, in a man|ner that will make no &s;mall part of the fame of his protectors. It al&s;o appears from his works, that he was happy in the patronage of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious characters of the pre&s;ent age. Encouraged by &s;uch a combination in his fa|vour, he publi&s;hed a book of poems, &s;ome in the Ovidian, &s;ome in the Horatian manner, in
<PB N="206" REF="209">
both which the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite judges pronounced he even rivalled his ma&s;ters. His love ver&s;es have re&s;cued that way of writing from contempt. In his tran&s;lations he has given us the very &s;oul and &s;pirit of his author. His Odes; his Epi&s;tles; his Ver&s;es; his Love Tales; all are the mo&s;t perfect things in all poetry.'</Q></P>
<P>If this repre&s;entation of our author's abilities were ju&s;t, it would &s;eem no wonder, if the two univer&s;ities &s;hould &s;trive with each other for the honour of his education, but it is cer|tain the world have not coincided with this opinion of Mr. Wel&s;ted; who, by the way, can hardly be thought the author of &s;uch an extrava|gant &s;elf-appiobation, unle&s;s it be an irony, which does not &s;eem improbable.</P>
<P>Our author, however, does not appear to have been a mean poet; he had certainly from nature an exceeding fine genius, but after he came to town he became a votary to plea&s;ure, and the applau&s;es of his friends, which taught him to overvalue his talents, perhaps &s;lackened his diligence, and by making him tru&s;t &s;olely to na|ture, &s;light the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art.</P>
<P>In the year 1718 he wrote the Triumvirate, or a Letter in Ver&s;e from Palemon to Celia from Bath, which was meant as a &s;atire again&s;t Mr. Pope. He wrote &s;everal other occa&s;ional pieces again&s;t this gentleman, who, in recompence of his enmity, has mentioned him twice in his Dunciad. In book ii. l. 200. where he repre&s;ents the poets flattering their patrens with the ful&s;ome &s;trains of panegyric, in order to procure from them that which they very much wanted, viz. money, he &s;hews Wel&s;ted as un&s;ucce&s;sful.<Q><L>But Wel&s;ted mo&s;t the poet's healing balm,</L>

Mr. Wel&s;ted was likewi&s;e characteri&s;ed in the Treati&s;e of the Art of Sinking, as a Didapper, and after as an Eel. He was likewi&s;e de&s;cribed under the character of another animal, a Mole, by the au|thor of the following &s;imile, which was handed about at the &s;ame time.<Q><L>Dear Wel&s;ted, mark in dirty hole</L>

<L>'Till lab'ring on, for want of eyes,</L>

<P>Upon the death of our author's grandfather, he enjoyed the place of payma&s;ter to the band of gentlemen-pen&s;ioners, in conjunction with his younger brother, Arthur More; of this place his mother procured the rever&s;ion from his late Maje&s;ty during his father's lifetime. Being a man of a gay di&s;po&s;ition, he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the favour of his grace the duke of Wharton, and being like him, de&s;titute of prudence, he joined with that volatile great man in writing a paper called the Inqui&s;itor, which breathed &s;o much the &s;pirit of Jacobiti&s;m, that the publi&s;her

He &s;eems willing to give &s;ome account of the po&s;&s;ibility of dulne&s;s making a wit which can be done no otherwi&s;e than by chance. The lines which have relation to Mr. More are &s;o elegantly &s;atyric, that it probably will not di&s;plea&s;e our readers to find them in&s;erted here.<Q><L>A poet's form &s;he plac'd before their eyes,</L>

<L>All as a partridge plump, full-fed, and fair,</L>

<P>Though the&s;e lines of Pope are &s;ufficiently &s;a|tirical, yet it &s;eems they very little affected Mr. More. A gentleman intimately acquainted with him informs us, that he has heard Mr. More &s;everal times repeat tho&s;e lines, without di&s;cover|ing
<PB N="212" REF="215">
any chagrin; and he u&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that he was now &s;ecure of being tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity: an honour which, &s;ays he, I could never have arrived at, but by Pope's means. The cau&s;e of the quarrel between this gentleman and that great poet &s;eems to have been this.</P>
<P>In a letter publi&s;hed in the Daily Journal March 18, 1728, written by Mr. More, he has the fol|lowing words, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Upon reading the third volume of Pope's Mi&s;cellanies, I found five lines which I thought excellent, and happening to prai&s;e them, a gentleman produced a modern comedy, the Rival Modes, publi&s;hed la&s;t year, where were the &s;ame ver&s;es to a tittle. The&s;e gentlemen are undoubtedly the fir&s;t plagiaries that pretend to make a reputation, by &s;tealing from a man's works in his own life-time, and out of a public print.'</Q> But it is apparent from the notes to the Dunciad, that Mr. More him&s;elf borrowed the lines from Pope; for in a letter dated January 27, 1726, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Pope, he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the&s;e ver&s;es which he had before given him leave to in&s;ert in the Rival Modes, would be known for his, &s;ome copies being got abroad. He de&s;ires, neverthe|le&s;s, that &s;ince the lines in his comedy have been read to &s;everal, Mr. Pope would not deprive it of them.'</Q></P>
<P>As a proof of this circum&s;tance, the te&s;timony of lord Bolingbroke is adduced, and the lady of Hugh Bethel, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> to whom the ver&s;es were ori|ginally addre&s;&s;ed, who knew them to be Mr. Pope's long before the Rival Modes was compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Our author further charges Mr. Pope with being an enemy to the church and &s;tate. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The Me|moirs of a Pari&s;h Clerk, &s;ays he, was a very dull, and unju&s;t abu&s;e of the bi&s;hop of Sarum (who wrote in defence of our religion and con&s;ti|tution) who has been dead many years.'</Q> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This

al&s;o, continues the author of the Notes to the Dunciad, is likewi&s;e untrue, it being known to divers, that the&s;e Memoirs were written at the &s;eat of the lord Harcourt in Oxford&s;hire, before the death of bi&s;hop Burnet, and many years be|fore the appearance of that hi&s;tory, of which they are pretended to be an abu&s;e. Mo&s;t true it is that Mr. More had &s;uch a de&s;ign, and was him&s;elf the man who pre&s;&s;ed Dr. Arbuth|not, and Mr. Pope to a&s;&s;i&s;t him therein; and that he borrowed tho&s;e Memoirs of the latter, when that hi&s;tory came forth, with intent to turn them to &s;uch abu&s;e; but being able to ob|tain from Pope but one &s;ingle hint, and either changing his mind, or having more mind than a|bility, he contented him&s;elf to keep the &s;aid Memoirs, and read them as his own to all his acquaintance. A noble per&s;on there is, into who&s;e company Pope once chanced to introduce him, who well remembered the conver&s;ation of Mr. More to have turned upon the contempt he had for that reverend prelate, and how full he was of a de&s;ign he declared him&s;elf to have of expo&s;ing him; this noble per&s;on is the earl of Peterborough.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus Mr. Pope was obliged to repre&s;ent this gen|tleman as a plagiary, or to pa&s;s for one him&s;elf. His ca&s;e indeed, as the author of the notes to the Dunciad ob&s;erves, was like that of a man who, as he was &s;itting in company, perceived his next neighbour had &s;tolen his handkerchief. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sir, &s;aid the thief, finding him&s;elf detected, do not expo&s;e me, I did it for mere want; be &s;o good but to take it privately out of my pocket again, and &s;ay nothing.' The hone&s;t man did &s;o, but the other cried out, See, gentlemen! what a thief we have among us! look, he is &s;tealing my handkerchief.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="217">
The plagiari&s;m of this per&s;on gave occa&s;ion to the following epigram;<Q><L>More always &s;miles whenever he recites;</L>

<P>The &s;maller pieces which we have heard attri|buted to this author, are, An Epigram on the Bridge at Blenheim, by Dr. Evans; Co&s;melia, by Mr. Pitt, Mr. Jones, &amp;c. The Saw-Pit, a Simile, by a Friend; and &s;ome unowned Letters, Adver|ti&s;ements, and Epigrams again&s;t Mr. Pope in the Daily Journal. He died in the year 1734, and as he wrote but one comedy un&s;ucce&s;sfully, and no other pieces of his meeting with any applau&s;e, the reader will probably look upon him as a man of little genius; he had a power however of rendering his conver&s;ation agreeable by a facetious and gentle|man-like manner, without any of the &s;tiffne&s;s of the &s;cholar, or the u&s;ual petulance of a poet. He always lived in affluent circum&s;tances, and by mixing with genteel company, his habit of ele|gance was never lo&s;t, a fate which too frequent|ly happens to tho&s;e, who, notwith&s;tanding the brighte&s;t parts, are excluded the circle of polite|ne&s;s by the oppre&s;&s;ions of poverty. In this light Mr. Pope mu&s;t have con&s;idered him, or he, who was one of the polite&s;t men of the age, as well as the greate&s;t poet, would never have intro|duced him to the earl of Peterborough. It does not appear that Mr. More had parts otherwi&s;e &s;ufficient to entitle him to the notice of Pope, and therefore he mu&s;t have con&s;idered him only as a gentleman. Had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as much pru|dence, as politene&s;s, he would have avoided by all

means incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of Pope, who, as he was the warme&s;t friend, was likewi&s;e a very powerful and implacable enemy. In this contro|ver&s;y, however, it is evident enough that Mr. Moore was the aggre&s;&s;or, and it is likewi&s;e certain that his puni&s;hment has been equal to his offence.</P>
<P>He died October 18, 1734, at Whi&s;ter, near I&s;leworth in Middle&s;ex, for which county he was a ju&s;tice of peace.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. JOHN DENNIS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS celebrated critic was born in Lon|don in the year 1657, his father being a Sadler, and an eminent citizen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jacob's Lives of the Poets.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He received his early education at Harrow on the Hill, under the pious and learned Dr. William Horn, having for his &s;choolfellows many young noblemen, who afterwards made a con&s;iderable figure in the &s;tate. He removed from Harrow to Caius College in Cambridge, where he was ad|mitted January 13, 1675, in the 18th year of his age. In due time Mr. Dennis took the degree of bachelor of arts, and after quitting the univer&s;i|ty he indulged a pa&s;&s;ion which he had entertain|ed for travelling, and &s;et out for France and
<PB N="216" REF="219">
taly. In the cour&s;e of his travels he, no doubt, made &s;uch ob&s;ervations upon the government and genius of the people whom he vi&s;ited, as enabled him to make a ju&s;t compari&s;on between foreign &s;tates and his own country. In all probability, while he was in France and Italy, he conceived an abhorrence of de&s;potic government, the ef|fects of which he then had an opportunity more intimately to di&s;cern, for he returned home &s;till more confirmed in Whig principles, by which his political conduct was ever governed.</P>
<P>Our author in his early years became acquaint|ed with &s;ome of the brighte&s;t geniu&s;es which then illuminated the regions of wit, &s;uch as Dry|den, Wycherly, Congreve, and Southern. Their conver&s;ation was in it&s;elf &s;ufficient to divert his mind from the acqui&s;ition of any profitable art, or the exerci&s;e of any profe&s;&s;ion. He ranked him|&s;elf among&s;t the wits, and from that moment held every attainment in contempt, except what relat|ed to poetry, and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis, by the in&s;tances of zeal which he gave for the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the reign of King William, and Queen Anne, obtained the pa|tronage of the duke of Marlborough, who pro|cured him the place of one of the Queen's wait|ers in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">\ne Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, worth 120 l. per annum, which Mr. Dennis held for &s;ix years. During the time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">\n attended at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, he lived &s;o profu&s;ely, and managed his affairs with &s;o little oeconomy, that in order to di&s;charge &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing demands, he was obliged to di&s;po&s;e of his place. When the earl of Hallifax, with whom he had the honour of being acquainted, heard of Mr. Dennis's de&s;ign, he &s;ent for him, and in the mo&s;t friendly manner, expo&s;tulated with him upon the folly, and ra&s;hne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ing of his place, by which (&s;ays his lord&s;hip) you will &s;oon become a beggar. Mr. Dennis repre&s;ented
<PB N="217" REF="220">
his exigences, and the pre&s;&s;ing demands that were then made upon him: which did not however &s;a|tisfy his lord&s;hip, who in&s;i&s;ted if he did &s;ell it, it &s;hould be with &s;ome rever&s;ion to him&s;elf for the &s;pace of forty years, a term which the earl had no notion Mr. Dennis could exceed. But he was mi&s;taken in his calculation upon our poet's con&s;titution, who out-lived the term of forty years &s;tipulated when he &s;old his place, and fulfilled in a very advanced age, what his lord&s;hip had pro|phe&s;ied would befal him. This circum&s;tance our author hints at in his dedication of his poem on the Battle of Ramellies, to lord Hallifax, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have lately, &s;ays he, had very great obligations to your lord&s;hip, you have been plea&s;ed to take &s;ome care of my fortune, at a time when I mo&s;t wanted it, and had the lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect it from you.'</Q> This poem on the Battle of Ramel|lies is a cold un&s;pirited performance; it has nei|ther fire, nor elevation, and is the true poetical &s;i&s;ter of another poem of his, on the Battle of Blenheim, addre&s;&s;ed to Queen Anne, and for which the duke of Marlborough rewarded him, &s;ays Mr. Coxeter, with a pre&s;ent of a hundred guineas. In the&s;e poems he has introduced a kind of machine|ry; good and bad angels intere&s;t them&s;elves in the action, and his hero, the duke of Marlborough, enjoys a large &s;hare of the coele&s;tial protection.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis had once contracted a friend&s;hip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which friend&s;hip he ill repaid. Sir Richard once be|came bail for Dennis, who hearing that Sir Richard was ar|re&s;ted on his account, cried out. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sdeath! Why did not he keep out of the way, as I did?'</Q></NOTE> with Sir Richard Steele, whom he afterwards &s;e|verely attacked. Sir Richard had promi&s;ed that he would take &s;ome opportunity of mentioning his works in public with advantage, and endea|vour to rai&s;e his reputation. When Sir Richard
<PB N="218" REF="221">
engaged in a periodical paper, there was a fair occa&s;ion of doing it, and accordingly in one of his Spectators he quotes the following couplet, which he is plea&s;ed to call humorous, but which however is a tran&s;lation from Boileau.<Q><L>One fool lolls his tongue out at another,</L>
<L>And &s;hakes his empty noddle at his brother.</L></Q></P>
<P>The citation of this couplet Mr. Dennis imagin|ed, was rather meant to affront him, than pay a compliment to his genius, as he could di&s;cover nothing excellent in the lines, and if there was, they being only a tran&s;lation, in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated the merit of them. Being fired with re&s;entment at this affront, he immediately, in a &s;pirit of fury, wrote a letter to the Spectator, in which he treat|ed him with very little ceremony, and informed him, that if he had been &s;incere in paying a com|pliment to him, he &s;hould have cho&s;en a quotation from his poem on the Battle of Ramellies; he then points out a particular pa&s;&s;age, of which he him&s;elf had a very high opinion, and which we &s;hall here in&s;ert as a &s;pecimen of that performance.</P>
<P>A coele&s;tial &s;pirit vi&s;its the duke of Marlborough the night before the battle, and after he has &s;aid &s;everal other things to him, goes on thus,<Q><L>A wondrous victory attends thy arms,</L>

<L>Would look how low, how vile to thy great mind,</L>
<L>If I could &s;et before th' a&s;toni&s;h'd eyes,</L>

<L>That is prepar'd for thy expiring &s;oul,</L>
<L>When thou arriv'&s;t at everla&s;ting day.</L></Q></P>
<P>The quotation by Mr. Dennis is longer, but we are per&s;uaded the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed that we do not take the trouble to tran&s;cribe the whole, as it does not improve, but rather grows more languid. How &s;trangely are people deceiv|ed in their own productions! In the language of &s;incerity we cannot di&s;cover a poetical conception, one &s;triking image, or one animated line in the a|bove, and yet Mr. Dennis ob&s;erves to Sir Richard Steele, that the&s;e are the lines, by quoting which, he would really have done him honour.</P>
<P>But Mr. Dennis's re&s;entment did not terminate here; he attempted to expo&s;e a paper in the Specta|tor upon dramatic conduct, in which the author en|deavours to &s;hew that a poet is not always obliged to di&s;tribute poetical ju&s;tice on this very rea&s;onable ac|count, that good and evil happen alike to all men on this &s;ide the grave. To this propo&s;ition our critic objects, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that it is not only a very fal&s;e, but a dangerous a&s;&s;ertion, that we neither know what men really are, nor what they &s;uffer. Be&s;ides, &s;ays he, let it be con&s;idered, that a man is a creature, who is created immortal, and a crea|ture
<PB N="220" REF="223">
con&s;equently that will find a compen&s;ation in futurity, for any &s;eeming inequality in his de&s;tiny here; but the creatures of a poetical creator, are imaginary, and tran&s;itory; they have no longer duration than the repre&s;entation of their re&s;pective fables, and con&s;equently if they offend, they mu&s;t be puni&s;hed during that repre|&s;entation, and therefore we are very far from pretending, that poetical ju&s;tice is an equal re|pre&s;entation of the ju&s;tice of the Almighty.'</Q> In &s;upport of this opinion our critic produces the example of Euripides, and the be&s;t poets among&s;t the ancients, who practi&s;ed it, and the authority of Ari&s;totle, who e&s;tabli&s;hed the rule. But nature, or Shake&s;pear, which is another word for nature, is by no means in favour of this equal di&s;tribu|tion. No character can be repre&s;ented in trage|dy ab&s;olutely perfect, as no &s;uch character ex|i&s;ts; but a character which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more vir|tues than vices, may be upon the whole amia|ble, and yet with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety may be made the chief &s;ufferer in the drama. If any pa&s;|&s;ion &s;trongly predominates in the heart of man, it will often expo&s;e him to &s;uch &s;nares, entangle him in &s;uch difficulties, and oppre&s;s him with &s;uch wants, that in the very nature of things, he mu&s;t &s;ink under the complicated weight of mi&s;ery. This may happen to a character extremely ami|able, the pa&s;&s;ion which governs him may be termed unhappy, but not guilty, or if it &s;hould partake the nature of guilt, fallible creatures cannot al|ways combat with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t guilty pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The drama being an imitation of nature, the poet cau&s;es a compo&s;ition of characters formed in his imagination to be repre&s;ented by players; the&s;e characters charm, or di&s;plea&s;e, not only for what they do; during the repre&s;entation of the fable, but we love, or hate them for what they have done before their appearance; and we dread, or
<PB N="221" REF="224">
warmly expect the con&s;equences of their re&s;oluti|ons after they depart the &s;tage. The illu&s;ion would not be &s;ufficiently &s;trong, if we did not &s;up|po&s;e the dramatic per&s;ons equa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nly accountable to the powers above us, as we are our&s;elves. This Shake&s;pear has taken care forcibly to impre&s;s upon his audience, in making the gho&s;t of the murthered king of Denmark, charge his &s;on not to touch his mother's life, but leave her to heaven; and the re|flexions of her own con&s;cience to goad and &s;ting her.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis's rea&s;oning, upon the whole amounts to this, that no perfect character &s;hould &s;uffer in the drama; to which it may be an&s;wered, that no per|fect character ever did &s;uffer in the drama; becau&s;e no poet who draws from nature, ever introduced one, for this very good rea&s;on, that there are none in exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis, who was re&s;tle&s;s in attacking tho&s;e writers, who met with &s;ucce&s;s, levelled &s;ome more critici&s;ms again&s;t the Spectators; and among&s;t the re&s;t endeavoured to expo&s;e Mr. Addi&s;on's Illu&s;tra|tions of the Old Ballad, called Chevy Chace; of which we &s;hall only &s;ay, that he performed this ta&s;k m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nre &s;ucce&s;sfully than he executed his Animad|ver&s;ions upon Poetical Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>We have already taken notice of the warm at|tachment Mr. Dennis always had to the Whig-In|tere&s;t, and his particular zeal for the Hanoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He wrote many letters and pamphlets, for the admini&s;tration of the earl of Godolphin, and the duke of Marlborough, and never failed to la&s;h the French with all the &s;everity natural to him.</P>
<P>When the peace (which the Whigs reckoned the mo&s;t inglorious that ever was made) was about to be ratified, Mr. Dennis, who certainly over-rated his importance, took it into his imagination, that when
<PB N="222" REF="225">
the terms of peace &s;hould be &s;tipulated, &s;ome per|&s;ons, who had been mo&s;t active again&s;t the French, would be demanded by that nation as ho&s;tages; and he imagined him&s;elf of importance e|nough to be made choice of, but dreaded his being given up to the French, as the greate&s;t evil that could befall him. Under the influence of this &s;trong delu&s;ion. he actually waited on the duke of Mariborough. and begg'd his grace's interpo&s;ition, that he might not be &s;acrificed to the French, for &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have always been their enemy.'</Q> To this &s;trange reque&s;t. his grace very gravely replied, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Do not fear, Mr. Dennis, you &s;hall not be given up to the French; I have been a greater enemy to them than you, and you &s;ee I am not afraid of being &s;acrificed, nor am in the lea&s;t di&s;turbed.'</Q> Mr. Dennis upon this retired. well &s;atisfied with his grace's an&s;wer, but there &s;till remained upon his &s;pirits a dread of his becoming a prey to &s;ome of the enemies of Great Britain.</P>
<P>He &s;oon after this retired into the country, to &s;pend &s;ome time at a friend's hou&s;e. While he was walking one day by the &s;ea &s;ide, he &s;aw a &s;hip in fall &s;ail approaching towards the &s;hore, which his di&s;tracted imagination dictated, was a French &s;hip &s;ent to carry him off. He hur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nied to the gen|tleman's hou&s;e with the utmo&s;t precipitation, up|braided him with treachery, as being privy to the attempts of the French again&s;t his life, and without ceremony quitted his hou&s;e, and po&s;ted to London, as fa&s;t as he could.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis, who never cared to be an unconcern|ed &s;pectator, when any bu&s;ine&s;s of a public or im|portant nature was in agitation, entered the li&s;ts with the celebrated Mr. Sacheverel, who in the year 1702 publi&s;hed at Oxford a piece called the Political Union, the purport of which was to &s;hew, that the Church and the State are invariably con|nected, and that the one cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the
<PB N="223" REF="226">
other. Mr. Dennis in an&s;wer to this, in a letter to a member of parliament, with much zeal, force of argument, and le&s;s ferocity than u&s;ual, endeavours to overthrow the propo&s;ition, and &s;hew the danger of prie&s;tcraft, both to religion and government.</P>
<P>In this letter he very &s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That &s;ince the very &s;pirit of the chri&s;tian religion, is the &s;pirit of union and charity, it follows by con|&s;equence, that a &s;pirit of divi&s;ion, is a &s;pirit of malice, and of the Devil. A true &s;on of the church, is he who appears mo&s;t for union, who breathes nothing but charity; who neglects all worldly greatne&s;s to bear his ma&s;ter's yoke; and who has learned of him to be meek and lowly of heart.'</Q></P>

<P>In 1706 our author publi&s;hed an E&s;&s;ay on the Italian Opera, in which, with an irre&s;i&s;table force, he &s;hews the extreme danger that a generous nation is expo&s;ed to, by too much indulging effeminate

mu&s;ic. In the preface he quotes a pa&s;&s;age from Boileau, in which that &s;atiri&s;t expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with much &s;everity again&s;t ema&s;culating diver&s;ions; and the Italian mu&s;ic in particular.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">'That the modern Italians have the very &s;ame &s;un and &s;oil with the antient Romans, and yet are their manners directly oppo&s;ite. Their men are neither virtuous, wi&s;e, or valiant, and they who have rea&s;on to know their women, never tru&s;t them out of their &s;ight. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to give any rea&s;on for &s;o great a difference between the antient Romans, and the modern Italians, but only luxury; and the reigning luxury of modern Italy, is that &s;oft and effeminate mu&s;ic, which abounds in the Opera.'</Q></P>
<P>In this E&s;&s;ay Mr. Dennis remarks, that en|tertainments entirely made up of mu&s;ic can ne|ver in&s;truct the mind, nor promote one excellent purpo&s;e in human nature. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Perhaps, &s;ays he, the pride and vanity that is in mankind, may determine the generality to give into mu&s;ic, at the expence of poetry.

<P>In 1711 Mr. Dennis publi&s;hed an E&s;&s;ay upon Public Spirit, being a &s;atire in pro&s;e, upon the Manners and Luxury of the Times, the chief &s;ources of our pre&s;ent Parties and Divi&s;ions. This is one of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed performances of our au|thor; the intention is laudable, and the execution equal to the goodne&s;s of the de&s;ign. He begins the E&s;&s;ay. with a definition of the love of our country, &s;hews how much the phra&s;e has been pro&s;|tituted, and how &s;eldom under&s;tood, or practi&s;ed in its genuine &s;en&s;e.

After the general di&s;traction which was immedi|ately con&s;equent upon the Re&s;toration, lord Halifax informs us, the people began to &s;hake off their &s;lavery in point of dre&s;s, and to be a&s;hamed of their &s;ervility in that particular; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'and that they might look the more &s;ays his lord&s;hip, like a di&s;tinct people, they threw off their fa&s;hions, and put on ve&s;ts: The French did not like this independence, this &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nght &s;hewn to their ta&s;te, as they thought it portended no good to their politics, con&s;idering that it is a natural introduction, fir&s;t to make the world their a&s;&s;es, that they may afterwards make

<P>After giving this quotation from the marquis of Halifax, he proceeds to inveigh again&s;t the various kinds of luxury, in which people of fa&s;hion indulge them&s;elves.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves that luxury has in a particular man|ner been de&s;tructive to the ladies: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That artific<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">al dainties rai&s;e in their con&s;titutions fierce ebulli|tions, and violent emotions, too rude for the de|licate texture of their fibres; and for half the year together, they neither take any air, nor u&s;e any exerci&s;e to remove them. From hence di&s;tempers of body and mind; from hence an in|finity of irregular de&s;ires, unlawful amours, in|trigues, vapours, and whim&s;ies, and all the nu|merous, melancholy croud of deep hy&s;terical &s;ymptoms; from hence it comes to pa&s;s that the fruit of their bodies lie in them like plants in hot-beds; from hence it proceeds that our Briti&s;h maids, who in the time of our Henrys, were not held marriageable till turned of twenty, are now become falling ripe at twelve, and forced to pre|maturene&s;s, by the heat of adventitious fire.

<P>In a pretty advanced age Mr. Dennis, who then laboured under &s;evere nece&s;&s;ities, publi&s;hed two volumes of Letters, by &s;ub&s;cription, which are by far the mo&s;t entertaining part of his writ|ings. They have more &s;prightline&s;s and force in them than, from reading his other works, we would be di&s;po&s;ed to imagine. They are addre&s;&s;ed to per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;hed by their fortune, ge|nius, and exalted &s;tation; the duke of Marlborough, the lord Lan&s;downe, earl of Godolphin, earl of Halifax, Mr. Dryden, Mr. Prior, Mr W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">\ncherley, Henry Cromwel, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Walter Moyle, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Sir Richard Blackmore. He entitles them Letters, Moral and Critical.

<P>There is likewi&s;e publi&s;hed among&s;t the&s;e letters, an enquiry into the genius and writings of Shake|&s;pear. He contends for Shake&s;pear's ignorance of the antients, and ob&s;erves, that it would derogate much from his glory to &s;uppo&s;e him to have read, or under&s;tood them, becau&s;e if he had, his not prac|ti&s;ing their art, and not re&s;training the luxuriance of his imagination would be a reproach to him. After be&s;towing the highe&s;t panegyric upon Shake|&s;pear, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he &s;eems to have been the very original of our Engli&s;h tragical harmony; that is the harmony of blank ver&s;e, diver&s;ified often by di&s;&s;yllable and tri&s;yllable terminations. For that diver&s;ity di&s;tingui&s;hes it from heroic har|mony, and bringing it nearer to common u&s;e, makes it more proper to gain attention, and more fit for action, and dialogue. Such ver&s;es we
<PB N="228" REF="231">
make when we are writing pro&s;e, we make &s;uch ver&s;e in common conver&s;ation.'</Q></P>
<P>One of the rea&s;ons Mr. Dennis a&s;&s;igns for Shake&s;pear's want of learning, is, that Julius Cae&s;ar, in the play which goes by his name, makes but a third-rate figure, and had he (&s;ays the author) con&s;ulted the Latin writers, he could not have been guilty of &s;uch an error; but this is far from being conclu&s;ive, which might as well be ow|ing to his having a contempt for Cae&s;ar's character, and an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration for tho&s;e of Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius.</P>
<P>Another pro&s;e E&s;&s;ay of Mr. Dennis's, which does him very great honour, is his Grounds of Cri|tici&s;m in Poetry. Among&s;t many ma&s;terly things, which he there advances, is the following. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The antient poets (&s;ays he) derived that advantage which they have over the moderns, to the con|&s;tituting their &s;ubjects after a religious manner; and from the precepts of Longinus, it appears that the greate&s;t &s;ublimity is to be derived from religious ideas.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Dennis then ob&s;erves, that one of the prin|cipal rea&s;ons, that has made the modern poetry &s;o cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">\nptible, is, that by dive&s;ting it&s;elf of religion, it is fallen from its dignity, and its original nature and excellence; and from the greate&s;t production in the mind of man, it is dwindled to an extravagant, and vain amu&s;ement. When &s;ubjects are in them|&s;elves great, the ideas of the writer mu&s;t likewi&s;e be great; and nothing is in its nature &s;o dignified as religion. This he illu&s;trates by many examples from Milton, who when he rai&s;es his voice to hea|ven, and &s;peaks the language of the divinity, then does he reach the true &s;ublime; but when he de|&s;cends to the more trifling con&s;ideration of human things, his wing is nece&s;&s;arily depre&s;&s;ed, and his &s;trains are le&s;s tran&s;porting.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="232">
We &s;hall now take a view of Mr. Dennis, in that part of his life and writings, in which he makes a le&s;s con&s;iderable figure, by expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the re&s;entment of one &s;o much his &s;uperior; and who; after a long provocation, at la&s;t let loo&s;e his rage again&s;t him, in a manner that no time can oblite|rate. Mr. Dennis we have already ob&s;erved, waged a perpetual war with &s;ucce&s;sful writers, except tho&s;e few who were his friends; but never engaged with &s;o much fury, and le&s;s ju&s;tice, again&s;t the writings of any poet, as tho&s;e of Mr. Pope.</P>
<P>Some time after the death of Dryden, when Pope's reputation began to grow, his friends who were &s;anguine in his intere&s;t, were impr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\ndent enough to make compari&s;ons, and really a&s;&s;ert, that Pope was the greate&s;t poet of the two: Dennis, who had made court to Dryden, and was re&s;pected by him, heard this with indignation, and immedi|ately exerted all the critici&s;m and force of which he was ma&s;ter, to reduce the character of Pope. In this attempt he neither has &s;ucceeded, nor did he pur&s;ue it like a gentleman.</P>
<P>In his reflexions on Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m, he u&s;es the following unmannerly epithets. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'A young &s;quab, &s;hort gentleman, who&s;e outward form tho' it &s;hould be that of a downright monkey, would not differ &s;o much from human &s;hape, as his un|thinking, immaterial part does from human un|der&s;tanding.&mdash;He is as &s;tupid and as venemous as an hunch-backed toad.&mdash;A book through which folly and ignorance, tho&s;e brethren &s;o lame, and impotent, do ridiculou&s;ly look very big, and very dull, and &s;trut, and hobble cheek by jowl, with their arms on kimbo, being led, and &s;up|ported, and bully-backed, by that blind Hector impudence.'</Q> The rea&s;ons which our critic gives for this extraordinary fury are equally ridiculous.</P>

<P>After the&s;e provocations, it is no wonder that Pope &s;hould take an opportunity of recording him in his Dunciad; and yet he had &s;ome e&s;teem for our author's learning and genius. Mr. Dennis put his name to every thing he wrote again&s;t him, which Mr. Pope con&s;idered as a circum&s;tance of candour.

<P>Our author gained little by his oppo&s;ition to Pope, in which he mu&s;t either have violated his judgment, or been under the influence of the &s;tronge&s;t prejudice that ever blinded the eyes of any man; for not to admire the writings of this excellent poet, is an argument of a total deprava|tion of ta&s;te, which in other re&s;pects does not ap|pear to be the ca&s;e of Mr. Dennis.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now take a view of our author in the light of a dramati&s;t. In the year 1697 a comedy of his was acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, called A Plot and No Plot, dedicated to the Earl of Sunderland. The &s;cope of this piece is to ridicule the credulity and principles of the Jacobites, the moral of which is this, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That there are in all parties, per&s;ons who find it their in|tere&s;t to deceive the re&s;t, and that one half of every faction makes a property in fee-&s;imple of the other, therefore we ought never to believe any thing will, or will not be, becau&s;e it is a|greeable, or contrary to our humours, but becau&s;e it is in it&s;elf likely, or improbable.

In 1699 a tragedy called Rinaldo and Armida was acted at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, dedicated to the Duke of Ormond. Scene the top of a mountain in the Canaries. The hint of the chief characters is owing to Ta&s;&s;o's Gieru&s;alemme, but the manners of them being by our author thought unequal in that great Italian, he has tak|en the liberty to change them, and form his cha|racters more agreeable to the &s;ubject. The rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nons for doing it are expre&s;&s;ed in the preface and pro|logue to the play.</P>
<P>Our author's next tragedy was upon the &s;ubject of Iphigenia, daughter to Agamemnon King of Argos, acted at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn 1704. Iphigenia was to have been &s;acrificed by her fa|ther, who was deluded by the fraud of Calchas, who proclaimed throughout the Grecian fleet, that the of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nended gods demanded of Agamemnon the &s;acrifice of his daughter to Lucina, and 'till that oblation was offered, the fleet would remain wind-bound. Accordingly, under pretence of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nr|rying her to Achilles, &s;he was betrayed from Ar|gos, but her mother, Clytemne&s;tra, di&s;covering the cheat, by a &s;tratagem prevented its execution, and effected her re&s;cue without the knowledge of a|ny one but he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n hu&s;band Agamemnon. A Grecian virgin being &s;acrificed in her place, Iphigenia is afterwards wrecked on the Coa&s;t of Scythia, and made the Prie&s;te&s;s of Diana. In five years time her brother Ore&s;tes, and his friend Pylades, are wrecked on the &s;ame &s;hore, but &s;aved from &s;laughter by the Queen of Scythia, becau&s;e &s;he loved Ore&s;tes.

di&s;concerts the de&s;ign. The &s;tory and incidents of this play are intere&s;ting and moving, but Mr. Dennis has not wrought the &s;cenes much in the &s;pi|rit of a tragedian: This was a &s;ubject admira|bly &s;uited for the talents of Otway. The di&s;co|very of Ore&s;tes's being the brother of Iphigenia is both &s;urprizing and natural, and though the &s;ubject is not well executed, yet is this by far the mo&s;t affecting tragedy of our author; it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to read it without tears, though it abounds with bomba&s;t.</P>
<P>The fourth play introduced upon the &s;tage by Mr. Dennis, 1704, was, a tragedy called Liberty A&s;&s;erted, dedicated to Anthony Henley, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> to whom he &s;ays he was indebted for the happy hint upon which it was formed. Soon after this he wrote another tragedy upon the &s;tory of Ap|pius and Virginia, which Mr. Maynwaring, in a letter to Mr. Dennis, calls one of our be&s;t modern tragedies; it is dedicated to Sidney Earl of Godol|phin.</P>
<P>He altered Shake&s;pear's Merry Wives of Wind|&s;or, and brought it on the &s;tage under the title of The Comical Gallant. Prefixed to this, is a large account of Ta&s;te in Poetry, and the Cau&s;es of its Degeneracy addre&s;&s;ed to the Hon. George Granville, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> afterwards Lord Lan&s;|downe.</P>
<P>Our author's next dramatic production was Co|riolanus, the Invader of his Country, or the Fa|tal Re&s;entment, a Tragedy; altered from Shake|&s;pear, and acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane. This piece met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition the fir&s;t night; and on the fourth another play was given out. The &s;econd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n night's audience was ve|ry &s;mall, though the play was exceedingly well acted. The third night had not the charges in money; the fourth was &s;till wor&s;e, and then ano|ther play was given out, not one place being taken
<PB N="234" REF="237">
in the boxes for any en&s;uing night. The ma|nagers were therefore obliged to di&s;continue it.</P>
<P>This u&s;age Mr. Dennis highly re&s;ented; and in his dedication to the duke of Newca&s;tle, then lord chamberlain, he makes a formal complaint again&s;t the managers. To this play Mr. Colley Cibber took the pains to write an epilogue, which Mrs. Oldfield &s;poke with univer&s;al applau&s;e, and for which poor peevi&s;h, jealous Dennis, abu&s;ed them both.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis happened once to go to the play, when a tragedy was acted, in which the machinery of thunder was introduced, a new artificial method of producing which he had formerly communicated to the managers. In|cen&s;ed by this circum&s;tance, he cried out in a tran&s;port of re&s;entment, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That is my thun|der by G&mdash;d; the villains will play my thunder, but not my plays.'</Q> This gave an alarm to the pit, which he &s;oon explained. He was much &s;ubject to the&s;e kind of whim&s;ical tran&s;ports, and &s;uffered the fervor of his imagination often to &s;ubdue the power of his rea&s;on; an in&s;tance of which we &s;hall now relate.</P>
<P>After he was worn out with age and poverty, he re&s;ided within the verge of the court, to pre|vent danger from his creditors. One Saturday night he happened to &s;aunter to a public hou&s;e, which he di&s;covered in a &s;hort time was out of the verge. He was &s;itting in an open drinking room, and a man of a &s;u&s;picious appearance hap|pened to come in. There was &s;omething about the man which denoted to Mr. Dennis that he was a Bailiff: this &s;truck him with a panic; he was a|fraid his liberty was now at an end; he &s;at in the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude, but dur&s;t not offer to &s;tir, left he &s;hould be &s;eized upon. After an hour or two had pa&s;&s;ed in this painful anxiety, at la&s;t the clock &s;truck twelve, when Mr. Dennis, in an ex|ta&s;y,
<PB N="235" REF="238">
cried out, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the &s;u&s;pect|ed per&s;on, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Now &s;ir, Bailiff, or no Bailiff, I don't care a farthing for you, you have no oower now.'</Q> The man was a&s;toni&s;hed at this behavi|our, and when it was explained to him, he was &s;o much affronted with the &s;u&s;picion, that had not Mr. Dennis found his protection in age, he would have &s;marted for his mi&s;taken opinion of him.</P>
<P>In the year 1705 a comedy of Mr. Dennis's called Gibraltar, or The Spani&s;h Adventure, was aded un&s;ucce&s;sfully at Drury-Lane Theatre. He was al&s;o author of a ma&s;que called Orpheus and Euridice.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis, con&s;idered as a dramatic writer, makes not &s;o good a figure as in his critical works; he under&s;tood the rules of writing, but it is not in the power of every one to carry their own theory into execution. There is one error which he endeavoured to reform, very material for the intere&s;t of dramatic poetry. He &s;aw, with concern, that love had got the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the tragic &s;tage, contary to the authority of the ancients, and the example of Shake&s;pear. He re&s;olved therefore to deviate a little from the reigning practice, and not to make his heroes &s;uch whining &s;laves in their amours, which not only deba&s;es the maje&s;ty of tragedy, but confounds mo&s;t of the principal characters, by making that pa&s;&s;ion the predominant quality in all. But he did not think it &s;afe at once to &s;hew his principal characters wholly ex|empt from it, le&s;t &s;o great and &s;udden a tran&s;i|tion &s;hould prove di&s;agreeable. He rather cho&s;e to &s;teer a middle cour&s;e, and make love appear violent, but yet to be &s;ubdued by rea&s;on, and give way to the influence of &s;ome other more noble pa&s;&s;ion; as in Rinaldo, to Glory; in Iphigenia, to Friend&s;hip; and in Liberty A&s;&s;erted, to the Public Good. He thought by the&s;e means an audience

might be entertained, and prepared for greater alterations, whereby the dignity of tragedy might be &s;upported, and its principal characters ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>

<P>After a life expo&s;ed to vici&s;&s;itudes, habituated to many di&s;appointments, and embroiled in un&s;uc|ce&s;sful quarrels, Mr. Dennis died on the 6th of January 1733, in the 77th year of his age. We have ob&s;erved that he outlived the rever&s;ion of his place, after which he fell into great di&s;tre&s;s, and as he had all his life been making enemies, by the ungovernable fury of his temper, he found few per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed to relieve him. When he was near the clo&s;e of his days, a play was acted for his benefit. This favour was procured him by the joint intere&s;t of Mr. Thom&s;on, Mr. Martin, Mr. Mallet, and Mr. Pope. The play was given by the company then acting at the little Theatre in the Hay-market, under the direction of Mr.
<PB N="238" REF="241">
Mills &s;en. and Mr. Cibber jun. the latter of whom &s;poke a prologue on the occa&s;ion, written by Mr. Pope.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis was le&s;s happy in his temper, than his genius; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no incon&s;iderable erudition, which was joined to &s;uch natural parts, as if ac|companied with prudence, or politene&s;s, might have rai&s;ed him, not only above want, but even to eminence. He was happy too in having very powerful patrons, but what could be done for a man, who declared war again&s;t all the world? Den|nis has given evidence again&s;t him&s;elf in the ar|ticle of politene&s;s; for in one of his letters he &s;ays, he would not retire to a certain place in the country, le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;turbed in his &s;tudies by the ladies in the hou&s;e: for, &s;ays he, I am not over-fond of the conver&s;ation of women. But with all his foibles, we cannot but con&s;ider him as a good critic, and a man of genius.</P>
<P>His perpetual misfortune was, that he aimed at the empire of wit, for which nature had not &s;uffi|ciently endowed him; and as his ambition prompt|ed him to obtain the crown by a furious oppo&s;ition to all other competitors, &s;o, like Cae&s;ar of old, his ambition overwhelmed him.</P>

<HEAD>G. GRANVILLE, L. LANSDOWNE,</HEAD>
<P>WAS de&s;cended from an illu&s;trious family, which traced their ance&s;try from Rollo, the fir&s;t duke of Normandy. He was &s;econd &s;on of Bernard Granville, and grand&s;on of the famous Sir Bevil Granville, killed at the battle of Lan&s;downe 1643. This nobleman received the fir&s;t tincture of his education in France, under the tuition of Sir William Ellis, a gentleman, who was eminent afterwards in many public employments.</P>
<P>When our author was but eleven years of age, he was &s;ent to Trinity College in Cambridge, where he remained five years, but at the age of thirteen was admitted to the degree of ma&s;ter of arts, having, before he was twelve years old, &s;pok|en a copy of Engli&s;h ver&s;es, of his own compo|&s;ition, to the Duche&s;s of York, when her Royal Highne&s;s paid a vi&s;it to that univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>At the time when the nation was embroiled by the public di&s;tractions, occa&s;ioned by the efforts of King James II. to introduce Popery, lord Lan&s;downe did not remain an unconcerned &s;pec|tator. He had early imbibed principles of loyal|ty, and as &s;ome of his forefathers had fallen in the cau&s;e of Charles I. he thought it was his duty to &s;acrifice his life al&s;o, for the intere&s;t of his
<PB N="240" REF="243">
Sovereign. However mi&s;taken he might be in this furious zeal for a Prince, the chief &s;cope of who&s;e reign was to overthrow the law, and intro|duce ab&s;olute dominion, yet he appears to be per|fectly &s;incere. In a letter he wrote to his father upon the expected approach of the Prince of Orange's fleet, he expre&s;&s;es the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire to &s;erve the King in per&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. Dict. Art. Granville.</NOTE>. This letter we &s;hall in&s;ert, but beg our readers patience to make a digre&s;&s;on, which will ju&s;tify what we have &s;aid con|cerning James II.</P>
<P>The genuine mark of a tyrant is cruelty, and it is with concern we can produce an in&s;tance of the mo&s;t inhuman barbarity in that Prince, which ever &s;tained the Annals of any reign. Cruelty &s;hould be the badge of no party; it ought to be equally the abhorrence of all; and whoever is taint|ed with it, &s;hould be &s;et up to view, as a terror to the world, as a mon&s;ter, whom it is the intere&s;t of mankind to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>After the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Monmouth's rebellion, many of the unfortunate per&s;ons engaged in it fled to London, and took &s;helter there, 'till the Act of Indemnity &s;hould be publi&s;hed. They who afforded them &s;helter, were either of the Mon|mouth faction, or induced from principles of hu|manity, to admini&s;ter to their &s;afety: what would become of the world, if our friends were always to for&s;ake us in di&s;tre&s;s? There lived then in Lon|don an amiable lady, attached to no party, who enjoyed a large fortune, which &s;he &s;pent in the exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive beneficence. She made it her bu&s;ine&s;s to vi&s;it the Jails, and the pri&s;oners who were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous and de&s;erving, &s;he relieved. Her hou&s;e was an a&s;ylum for the poor; &s;he lived but for charity, and &s;he bad every
<PB N="241" REF="244">
hour the prayers of the widow and orphan poured out to her. It happened that one of the rebels found &s;helter in her hou&s;e; &s;he &s;uffered him to be &s;creened there; &s;he fed and cloathed him. The King had often declared that he would ra|ther pardon tho&s;e who were found in arms a|gain&s;t him, than the people who harboured, or &s;ecretly encouraged them. This mi&s;creat, who &s;ometimes ventured out at night to a public hou&s;e, was informed, that the King had made &s;uch a declaration, and it entered into his ba&s;e heart to betray his benefactre&s;s. He accordingly went be|fore a magi&s;trate, and lodged an information, upon which the lady was &s;ecured, brought to a trial, and upon the evidence of this ungrateful villain, ca&s;t for her life. She &s;uffered at a &s;take with the mo&s;t re&s;igned chearfulne&s;s, for when a woman is convicted of trea&s;on, it &s;eems, &s;he is fentenced to be burnt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Burnet's Hi&s;tory of his own Times.</NOTE>. The reader will ea&s;ily judge what &s;ort of bowels that King mu&s;t have, who could permit &s;uch a puni&s;hment to take place upon a woman &s;o compleatly amiable, upon the evidence of a villain &s;o con&s;ummately infamous, and he will, we are per&s;uaded, be of opinion that had his Maje&s;ty po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and kingdoms, he de&s;erved to lo&s;e them all for this one act of ge|nuine barbarity.</P>
<P>Lord Lan&s;downe, who did not con&s;ider, or was not then capable of di&s;covering, the dangers to which this prince expo&s;ed his people, wrote the following letter to his father, earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing him to permit his entering voluntarily into king James's &s;ervice.<LETTER>

The author of the Notes on this line of the Dunciad, b. iii. 1. 326.<Q><L>Gay dies unpen&s;ioned with a hundred friends;</L></Q> ob&s;erves hat this opera was a piece of &s;atire, which hits all ta&s;tes and degrees of men, from tho&s;e of the highe&s;t quality to the very rabble. <Q REND="inline">"That ver&s;e of Horace<Q><L>Primores populi arripuit populumque tributim,</L></Q> could never be &s;o ju&s;tly applied as in this ca&s;e. The va&s;t &s;ucce&s;s of it was unprecedented, and al|mo&s;t incredible. What is related of the wonder|ful effects of the ancient mu&s;ic, or tragedy, hard|ly came up to it. Sophocles and Euripides were le&s;s followed and famous; it was acted in London &s;ixty three days uninterrupted, and renewed the next &s;ea&s;on with equal applau&s;e. It &s;pread into all the great towns of England, was played in many places to the thirtieth and fortieth time; at Bath and Bri&s;tol fifty. It made its progre&s;s into Wales, Scotland and Ireland, where it was perform|ed twenty-four days together. It was la&s;tly acted in Minorca. The fame of it was not confined to the author only; the ladies carried about with them the favourite &s;ongs of it in fans; and hou&s;es were furni&s;hed with it in &s;creens. The girl who acted Polly, 'till then ob&s;cure, became all at once the favourite of the town, her pictures were en|graved, and &s;old in great numbers; her life writ|ten; books of letters and ver&s;es to her publi&s;hed; and pamphlets made even of her &s;ayings and je&s;ts. Furthermore, it drove out of England, for that &s;ea|&s;on, the Italian Opera, which had carried all be|fore it for ten years; that idol of the nobility and the people, which Mr. Dennis by the labours

<P>Dr. Swift in his Intelligencer Numb. 3. has giv|en us a vindication of Mr. Gay, and the Beggars Opera; he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that though an evil ta&s;te be very apt to prevail both in Dublin and in Lon|don; yet, there is a point which whoever can rightly touch, will never fail of plea&s;ing a very great majority; &s;o great that the di&s;likers, out of dullne&s;s, or affectation, will be &s;ilent, and forced to fall in with the herd; the point I mean is, what we call humour, which, in its perfection, is allowed to be much preferable to wit, if it be not rather the mo&s;t u&s;eful, and agreeable &s;pecies of it.&mdash;Now I take the comedy, or farce (or whatever name the critic will allow it) called The Beggar's Opera, to excel in this article of humour, and upon that merit to have met with &s;uch prodigious &s;ucce&s;s, both here and in Eng|land.'</Q> The dean afterwards remarks, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that an opinion obtained, that in this opera, there ap|pears to be &s;ome reflexions on courtiers and &s;tate&s;men. It is true indeed (&s;ays he) that Mr. Gay hath been &s;omewhat &s;ingular in the cour&s;e of his fortunes, attending the court with a large &s;tock of real merit, a mode&s;t and agreeable con|ver&s;ation, a hundred promi&s;es, and five hundred friends, hath failed of preferment, and upon a very weighty rea&s;on; he lay under the &s;u&s;picion of having written a Libel, or Lampoon, again&s;t a great mini&s;ter, it is true that great mini&s;ter was demon&s;tratively convinced, and publickly owned his conviction, that Mr. Gay was not the author, but having laid under the &s;u&s;picion, it &s;eemed very ju&s;t that he &s;hould &s;uffer the pu|ni&s;hment, becau&s;e in this mo&s;t reformed age the virtues of a great mini&s;ter are no more to be &s;u&s;pected, than the cha&s;tity of Cae&s;ar's wife.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="257">
The dean then tells us, that our author in this piece has, by a turn of humour entirely new, placed vices of all kinds in the &s;tronge&s;t, and mo&s;t odi|ous light, and thereby done eminent &s;ervice both to religion and morality. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This appears from the unparalleled &s;ucce&s;s he has met with; all ranks, parties, and denominations of men, either crowd|ing to &s;ee his Opera, or reading it with de|light in their clo&s;ets; even mini&s;ters of &s;tate, whom he is thought mo&s;t to have offended, appearing frequently at the Theatre, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own innocence, and to convince the world how unju&s;t a parallel, ma|lice, envy and di&s;affection to the government have made.&mdash;In this happy performance of Mr. Gay, all the characters are ju&s;t, and none of them carried beyond nature, or hardly beyond practice. It di&s;covers the whole &s;y&s;tem of that commonwealth, or that imperium in imperio of iniquity e&s;tabli&s;hed among us, by which, neither our lives, nor our properties are &s;ecure, either in highways, or in public a&s;&s;emblies, or even in our own hou&s;es; it &s;hews the mi&s;erable lives and con&s;tant fate of tho&s;e abandoned wretches; for how &s;mall a price they &s;ell their &s;ouls, be|trayed by their companions, receivers, and pur|cha&s;ers of tho&s;e thefts and robberies. This co|medy contains likewi&s;e a &s;atire, which though it doth by no means affect the pre&s;ent age, yet might have been u&s;eful in the former, and may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o in ages to come, I mean where the author takes occa&s;ion of comparing tho&s;e common robbers of the public, and their &s;everal &s;tratagems of betraying, undermining, and hang|ing each other, to the &s;everal arts of politicians in the time of corruption. This comedy like|wi&s;e expo&s;es, with great ju&s;tice, that unnatural ta&s;te for Italian mu&s;ic among us, which is whol|ly un&s;uitable to our Northern climate, and the

genius of the people, whereby we are overrun with Italian effeminacy. An old gentleman &s;aid to me many years ago, when the practice of an unnatural vice grew &s;o frequent in London, that many were pro&s;ecuted for it; he was &s;ure it would be the forerunner of Italian operas and &s;ingers, and then we &s;hould want nothing but &s;tabbing, or poi&s;oning, to make us perfect Italians. Upon the whole I deliver my judg|ment; that nothing but &s;ervile attachment to a party, affectation of &s;ingularity, lamentable dull|ne&s;s, mi&s;taken zeal, or &s;tudied hypocri&s;y, can have any objection again&s;t this excellent moral performance of Mr. Gay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Swift, ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s of the Beggar's Opera induced our author to add a &s;econd part, in which, however, he was di&s;appointed, both in profit and fame. His opera entitled Polly, de&s;igned as a &s;equel of the former, was prohibited by the lord chamberlain from being repre&s;ented on the &s;tage, when every thing was ready for the rehear&s;al of it, but was &s;oon after printed in 4to. to which the author had a very large &s;ub&s;cription. In the pre|face Mr. Gay gives a particular account of the whole affair in the following manner; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'On Thur&s;|day December 12 (&s;ays he) I received this an|&s;wer from the chamberlain, that it &s;hould not be allowed to be acted, but &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.

<P>THE unhappy nobleman, the memoirs of who&s;e life we are now about to relate, was en|dowed by nature with all tho&s;e &s;hining qualifications by which a great man can be formed. He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t exten&s;ive memory, a &s;trong and lively imagination, and quick and ready apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>By the immediate authority of his father, our noble author's &s;tudies were confined to one particu|lar branch of learning; with a view, no doubt, that his &s;on's uncommon genius might make the greater progre&s;s, and &s;hine with a &s;uperior lu&s;tre in that &s;pecies of erudition he had made choice of for him. On this account it was, that the earl his fa|ther would not permit the young lord to go to pub|lic or private &s;chools, or to any college, or univer|&s;ity, but had him carefully in&s;tructed by dome&s;tic tutors; and as he gave an early di&s;play of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing parts, the earl bent all his thoughts how to improve them in the be&s;t manner, for his &s;on's future advantage.</P>
<P>As &s;oon at this &s;prightly genius, had laid a &s;uffi|cient foundation in cla&s;&s;ical learning, he &s;tudied hi&s;|tory, particularly that of his own country, by which he was able to di&s;cern the principles of the con&s;ti|tution, the revolutions it has undergone, the variety of accidents by which it may be endangered, and the true policy by which it can be pre&s;erved. While he thus read hi&s;tory, he became a politician;
<PB N="261" REF="264">
and as he did not neglect other &s;ciences, he acquir|ed a general knowledge both of life and things, be|fore mo&s;t other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction begin to read, or think at all.</P>
<P>By his not receiving an academical education, he e&s;caped that &s;tiffne&s;s and moro&s;ene&s;s of temper frequently contracted by tho&s;e who have been for &s;ome time condemned to a collegiate ob&s;curity. Neither had he the lea&s;t tincture of a haughty &s;upe|riority, ari&s;ing from the noblene&s;s of his birth, and the lu&s;tre of his abilities. His conver&s;ation was ea&s;y, plea&s;ant, and in&s;tructive, always &s;uited to his company, of whatever quality, humour, or capacity they were.</P>
<P>As it was the earl of Wharton's view, to qualify his &s;on to fill that high &s;tation, in which his birth would one day place him with advantage to his country; his great care was to form him a com|pleat orator. For this purpo&s;e &s;ome of the princi|pal parts in the be&s;t Engli&s;h Tragedies were a&s;&s;ign'd him at times to &s;tudy, particularly tho&s;e of Shake|&s;pear, which he u&s;ed to repeat before a private au|dience. Sometimes his father gave him &s;peeches which had been uttered in the hou&s;e of peers, and which the young lord got by heart, and delivered with all the graces of action and elocution; with &s;o much propiety of expre&s;&s;ion, empha&s;is of voice, and pronunciation wherever it was re|qui&s;ite, as &s;hewed his lord&s;hip was born for this arduous province. Nor did the excellency of the&s;e performances receive a &s;mall additional beauty from the gracefulne&s;s of his per&s;on, which was at once &s;oft and maje&s;tic.</P>
<P>Thus endowed by nature to charm and per&s;uade, what expectations might not have been formed on him? A youth of a noble de&s;cent, who added to that advantage the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing parts ever man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, improved by an uncommon and well re|gulated education. What pity is it, this illu&s;trious
<PB N="262" REF="265">
young man, born to have dictated to the &s;enate, and directed the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;tate, with the eyes of a people fixed upon him, &s;hould fall &s;o exceedingly &s;hort of tho&s;e fair hopes, he had &s;o ju&s;tly rai&s;ed in every brea&s;t. He wanted one quality, without which birth, fortune, and abilities, &s;uffer a con|&s;iderable diminution. That quality is prudence; of which the duke of Wharton was &s;o de&s;titute, that all his parts were lo&s;t to the world, and the world lo&s;t to him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t prelude to his misfortunes, may ju&s;t|ly be reckoned his falling in love, and privately marrying a young lady, the daughter of major ge|neral Holmes; a match by no means &s;uited to his birth, fortune and character; and far le&s;s to the ambitious views his father had of di&s;po&s;ing of him in &s;uch a marriage, as would have been a con&s;ider|able addition to the fortune and grandeur of his il|lu&s;trious family. However di&s;appointed the earl of Wharton might be, in his &s;on's marrying beneath his quality; yet that amiable lady who became his daughter-in-law de&s;erved infinitely more felicity than &s;he met with by an alliance with his family; and the young lord was not &s;o unhappy through any mi&s;conduct of hers, as by the death of his father, which this precipitate marriage is thought to have ha&s;tened. The duke being &s;o early freed from paternal re&s;traints, plunged him&s;elf into tho&s;e numberle&s;s exce&s;&s;es, which became at la&s;t fatal to him; and he proved, as Pope expre&s;&s;es it,<Q><L>A tyrant to the wife his heart approv'd;</L>
<L>A rebel to the very king he lov'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>The young lord in the beginning of the year 1716 indulged his de&s;ire of travelling and fini&s;hing his education abroad; and as he was de&s;igned to be in&s;tructed in the &s;tricte&s;t Whig principles, Geneva was judged a proper place for his re&s;idence. On
<PB N="263" REF="266">
his departure from England for this purpo&s;e, he took the rout of Holland, and vi&s;ited &s;everal courts of Germany, and that of Hanover in particular.</P>
<P>Though his lord&s;hip was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his fa|mily e&s;tate, as much as a minor could be; yet his tru&s;tees very much limited his expences, and made him too moderate remittances, for a per&s;on of his rank and &s;pirit. This gave him great unea&s;ine&s;s, and embarra&s;&s;ed him much in his way of living, which ill &s;uited with the profu&s;ion of his ta&s;te. To remove the&s;e difficulties, he had recour&s;e to mortgaging, and by premiums and large intere&s;t paid to u&s;urers, &s;upplied his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, by rendering his affairs &s;till wor&s;e.</P>
<P>The unhappy divi&s;ions which reigned in England at the time this young peer made his fir&s;t entry into public life, rendered it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;tand neuter, and on whatever &s;ide he &s;hould declare him&s;elf, &s;till there was danger. The world gene|rally expected he would follow the &s;teps of his father, who was one of the fir&s;t Engli&s;h gentlemen who joined the prince of Orange, and continued firm to the Revolution principles, and con&s;equently approv|ed the Hanoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, upon who&s;e ba&s;is it was built. But whatever motives influenced the young marquis (for king William had be&s;towed this title on his father) he thought proper to join the contrary party. The cau&s;e of his abandoning the principles of the Whigs is thought to be this.</P>
<P>The marquis being arrived at Geneva, he con|ceived &s;o great a di&s;gu&s;t at the dogmatical precepts of his governor, the re&s;traints he endeavoured to lay upon him, and the other in&s;tances of &s;trict di&s;|cipline exerci&s;ed in that meridian of Pre&s;byteriani&s;m, that he fell upon a &s;cheme of avoiding the&s;e intole|rable incumbrances; &s;o, like a torrent long confined within its bounds by &s;trong banks, he broke loo&s;e, and entered upon engagements, which, together with the natural impetuo&s;ity of his temper, threw him
<PB N="264" REF="267">
into &s;uch inconveniencies, as rendered the remain|ing part of his life unhappy.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip, as we have already ob&s;erved, being very much di&s;gu&s;ted with his governor, left him at Geneva, and as if he had been flying from a pe&s;ti|lence, &s;et out po&s;t for Lyons, where he arrived about the middle of October 1716.</P>
<P>The author of the duke of Wharton's life has informed us, that the rea&s;on of his lord&s;hip's leaving his governor &s;o abruptly, was on account of the freedom with which that gentleman treated him, a circum&s;tance very di&s;gu&s;tful to a per&s;on of his qua|lity. He took leave of him in the following manner.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip &s;omewhere in his travels had picked up a bear's cub, of which he was very fond, and carried it about with him; but when he was deter|mined to abandon his tutor, he left the cub be|hind him, with the following note addre&s;&s;ed to him. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'Being no longer able to bear with your ill-u&s;age, I think proper to be gone from you; however, that you may not want company, I have left you the bear, as the mo&s;t &s;uitable companion in the world, that could be picked out for you.'</P></Q></P>
<P>When the marquis was at Lyons he took a very &s;trange &s;tep, little expected from him. He wrote a letter to the Chevalier de St. George, then re&s;iding at Avignon, to whom he pre&s;ented a very fine &s;tone-hor&s;e. Upon receiving this pre&s;ent, the Chevalier &s;ent a man of quality to the marquis, who carried him privately to his court, where he was received with the greate&s;t marks of e&s;teem, and had the title of duke of Northumberland conferred upon him. He remained there however but one day, and then returned po&s;t to Lyons; from whence he &s;et out for Paris. He likewi&s;e made a vi&s;it
<PB N="265" REF="268">
to the queen dowager of England, con&s;ort to king James the IId, then re&s;iding at St. Germains, to whom he paid his court, pur&s;ued the &s;ame ra&s;h mea&s;ures as at Avignon.</P>
<P>During his &s;tay at Paris, his winning addre&s;s, and a&s;toni&s;hing parts; gained him the e&s;teem and ad|miration of all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects of both parties who happened to be there. The earl of Stair, then em|ba&s;&s;ador at the court of France from the king of Great Britain, notwith&s;tanding all the reports to the marquis's di&s;advantage, thought proper to &s;hew &s;ome re&s;pect to the repre&s;entative of &s;o great a fa|mily, which had &s;o re&s;olutely &s;upported the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration, e&s;pecially as he was a young man of &s;uch great per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, both natural and acquired, and ble&s;t with a genius &s;o capable of &s;erving his country even in the mo&s;t eminent &s;tation.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations induced lord Stair, who was a prudent, di&s;cerning mini&s;ter, to countenance the young marquis, give him frequent invitations to his table, and to u&s;e him with di&s;tingui&s;hing civility. The earl was likewi&s;e in hopes, by the&s;e gentle mea|&s;ures, and this in&s;inuating behaviour, to win him to his party, which he had good rea&s;on to think he hated. His excellency never failed to lay hold of every opportunity, to give him &s;ome admonitions, which were not always agreeable to the vivacity of his temper, and &s;ometimes provoked him to great indi&s;cretions. Once in particular, the amba&s;&s;ador extolling the merit, and noble behaviour of the marquis's father, added, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he hoped he would follow &s;o illu&s;trious an example of fidelity to his prince, and love to his country, by treading in the &s;ame &s;teps.'</Q>&mdash;Upon which the marquis im|mediately an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he thanked his ex|cellency for his good advice, and as his excellency had al&s;o a worthy and de&s;erving father, he hoped he would likewi&s;e copy &s;o bright an original and tread in all his &s;teps.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="269">
This was a &s;evere &s;arca&s;m, as the amba&s;&s;ador's father had betrayed his ma&s;ter in a manner that was quite &s;hameful. He acted the &s;ame part in Scotland which Sunderland did in England. They pu&s;hed on king James the IId. to take violent and uncon|&s;titutional mea&s;ures, to make his ruin certain: They &s;ucceeded in their &s;cheme, and after the Revolution, boa&s;ted their conduct as meritorious; but however nece&s;&s;ary it might be for king William, upon prin|ciples of policy to reward the betrayers, he had yet too good a heart to approve the treachery.&mdash;But to return to the marquis, we &s;hall mention another of his juvenile f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nghts, as an in&s;tance to what ex|travagant and unaccountable exce&s;&s;es, the incon&s;tancy of his temper would &s;ometimes tran&s;port him.</P>
<P>A young Engli&s;h &s;urgeon, who went to Paris, to improve him&s;elf in his bu&s;ine&s;s, by ob&s;erving the practice in the celebrated ho&s;pitals, pa&s;&s;ing by the emba&s;&s;ador's hou&s;e on the 10th of June at night, took the liberty to break his excellency's windows becau&s;e there was no bonfire before his door. Up|on this outrage he was &s;eized and committed pri&s;oner to Fort L'Eveque. This treatment of the young &s;urgeon was re&s;ented by the marquis; but he &s;ought for no other &s;atisfaction than to break the amba&s;&s;ador's windows a &s;econd time. Accordingly his lord&s;hip propo&s;ed it to an Iri&s;h lieutenant-general, in the &s;er|vice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nrance, a gentleman of great honour and of the highe&s;t reputation for abilities in military affairs, de&s;iring his company and a&s;&s;i&s;tance therein.

<P>About the latter end of December 1716, the marquis arrived in England, where he did not re|main long, till he &s;et out for Ireland; in which kingdom, on account of his extraordinary qualities, he had the honour done him of being admitted, though under age, to take his &s;eat in that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly of the hou&s;e of peers, to which he had a right as earl of Rathfarnam, and marquis of Ca|therlough. Here he e&s;pou&s;ed a very different in|tere&s;t from that which he had &s;o lately embraced. He di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion as a vio|lent partizan for the mini&s;try; and acted in all other re&s;pects, as well in his private as public capacity, with the warme&s;t zeal for the government. The &s;peeches which he made in the hou&s;e upon many occa&s;ions, uttered with &s;o much force of expre&s;&s;ion, and propriety of empha&s;is, were an irre&s;i&s;table de|mon&s;tration of his abilities, and drew upon him the admiration of both kingdoms. The marquis's ar|guments had very great influence on which &s;ide of the que&s;tion &s;oever he happened to be.&mdash;No noble|man, either in that or the Engli&s;h hou&s;e of peers, ever acquitted him&s;elf with greater reputation, or behaved with a more becoming dignity than he did during this &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Iri&s;h parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="271">
In con&s;equence of this zeal for the new govern|ment, &s;hewn at a time when they &s;tood much in need of men of abilities, and &s;o little expected from the young marquis, the king who was no &s;tranger to the mo&s;t refined rules of policy, created him a duke, the highe&s;t degree of a &s;ubject.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as the duke of Wharton came of age, he was introduced to the hou&s;e of lords in England, with the like blaze of reputation, and rai&s;ed jealou|&s;ies in the brea&s;ts of the mo&s;t con&s;ummately artful, and be&s;t qualified in the hou&s;e of peers. A little before the death of lord Stanhope, his grace, who was con&s;tant in nothing but incon&s;tancy, again changed &s;ides, oppo&s;ed the court, and endeavoured to defeat all the &s;chemes of the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>He appeared one of the mo&s;t forward and vigor|ous in the defence of the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and
<PB N="269" REF="272">
in oppo&s;ing the bill for inflicting pains and penal|ties on that prelate.</P>
<P>The judicious ob&s;ervations he made on the trial of the bi&s;hop, and the manner in which he &s;um|med up and compared a long and perplexed kind of evidence, with inimitable art and per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\np<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">\nuity, may be &s;een in the duke's &s;peech upon that extraordinary occa&s;ion, which is a la&s;ting proof of his amazing abilities in the legi&s;lative capacity, as well as of his general knowledge of public bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>He, however, did not confine this &s;pirit of oppo|&s;ition to the hou&s;e of lords, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">
 it both in city and country, promoting in all kinds of elections &s;uch per&s;ons as were &s;uppo&s;ed to be no fautors of the court. Such was the hatred he now conceived to the mini&s;try, and &s;uch his de&s;ire of becoming eminent; that he even pu&s;hed him&s;elf into the city of London; was inve&s;ted with the rights and pri|vileges of a citizen, and was entered a member of the wax-chandler's company; by virtue of which he appeared at all meetings, charmed all &s;ocieties, and voted in his own right upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his a&s;toni&s;hing activity in oppo|&s;ition to the court, he was not yet &s;atisfied that he had done enough. He could not be in all places, and in all companies at once. As much an orator as he was, he could not talk to the whole na|tion, and therefore he printed his thoughts twice a week, in a paper called the True-Briton, &s;everal thou&s;ands of which being di&s;per&s;ed weekly, the duke was plea&s;ed to find the whole kingdom giving attention to him, and admiring him as an author, though they did not at all approve his rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e political papers, which were reckoned by &s;ome the &s;tandard of good &s;en&s;e, and elegant writ|ing,
<PB N="270" REF="273">
were collected together in his life-time, and reprinted by his order, with a preface, in which he gives his rea&s;ons for engaging in an undertak|ing &s;o uncommon to a per&s;on of his di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Here it will not be improper to remark, that notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e in&s;tances of the duke's zeal, his &s;incerity in oppo&s;ing the mi|ni&s;try was yet &s;u&s;pected, as his former beha|vio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nr was &s;o very incon&s;i&s;tent with it; but he never fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nled to ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">\nify him&s;elf throughout the dif|ferent and contrary cour&s;es of his conduct, pre|tending always to have acted con&s;i&s;tently with the honour and intere&s;t of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nealm. But he never was able in this particular to obtain the public judgment in his favour.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\ne to reconcile all the various ac|tions of this noble-man. He was certainly too much governed by whim and accident. From this time forward, however, though he might deviate from the &s;trict rules of a moral life, he cannot be &s;aid to have done &s;o with re&s;pect to his politics. The &s;ame principles on which he &s;et out, he carried to his grave, with &s;teadine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\ns through all the events of fortune, and underwent &s;uch nece&s;&s;ities, as few of his quality ever experienced, in a cau&s;e, the revival and &s;ucce&s;s of which had long been de&s;pe|rate, before he engaged in it.</P>
<P>The duke's boundle&s;s profu&s;ion had by this time &s;o burthened his e&s;tate, that a decree of chancery took hold on it, and ve&s;ted it in the hands of tru&s;tees for the payment of his debts, but not without making a provi&s;ion of 1200 l. per annum for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This allowance not being &s;uf|ficient to &s;upport his title with &s;uitable dignity at home, he propo&s;ed to go abroad for &s;ome years, 'till his e&s;tate &s;hould clear it&s;elf of incum|brances. His friends, for his own &s;ake, were
<PB N="271" REF="274">
plea&s;ed with this re&s;olution, and every body con|&s;idered this cour&s;e as the mo&s;t prudent, that in &s;uch circum&s;tances could be taken. But in this the world was deceived, for he went abroad from no &s;uch prudent motive, oeconomy being a vir|tue of which he never had the lea&s;t notion in any part of his life. His bu&s;ine&s;s at Vienna was to execute a private commi&s;&s;ion, not in &s;avour of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, nor did he ever &s;hine to greater advantage, as to his per&s;onal character, than at the Imperial court.</P>
<P>From Vienna his grace made a tour to the court of Spain, where his arrival alarmed the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter &s;o much, that two expre&s;&s;es were &s;ent from Madrid to London, upon the apprehen&s;ion that his grace was received there in the character of an amba&s;&s;ador, upon which the duke received a &s;ummons under the Privy Seal to return home. His behaviour on this occa&s;ion was a &s;ufficient indication that he never de&s;igned to return to Eng|land, whil&s;t affairs remained in the &s;ame &s;tate; and the admini&s;tration in the &s;ame hands they then were in. This he often declared from his going abroad the &s;econd time, which, no doubt, was the occa&s;ion of his treating that &s;olemn order with &s;o much indig|nity, and endeavouring to enflame the Spani&s;h court, not only again&s;t the per&s;on who delivered the warrant, but again&s;t the court of Great Brit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nin it|&s;elf, for exerci&s;ing an act of power, as he was plea&s;ed to call it, within the juri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\ndiction of his Catholic Maje&s;ty. After this he acted openly in the &s;ervice of the Pretender, and appeared at his court, where he was received with great marks of favour.</P>
<P>While his grace was thus employed abroad, his duche&s;s, who had been neglected by him, died in England, on the 14th of April 1726, and left no i&s;&s;ue behind her. The lady's death gave the duke no great &s;hock. He was di&s;encumbered of her
<PB N="272" REF="275">
and had now an opportunity of mending his for|tune by marriage.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the duke fell violently in love with Mademci&s;elle Obern, a beautiful young lady at the Spani&s;h court, who was then one of the maids of honour to the Queen of Spain. She was daughter of an Iri&s;h colonel in that &s;ervice, who being dead, her mother lived upon a pen&s;ion the King allowed her, &s;o that this lady's fortune con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in her per&s;onal accompli&s;hments. Many arguments were u&s;ed by their friends on both &s;ides to di&s;&s;uade them from the marriage. The Queen of Spain, when the duke a&s;ked her con&s;ent, repre&s;ented to him in the mo&s;t lively terms, that the con&s;equence of the match would be mi&s;ery to both, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed her con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Having now no hopes of obtaining her, he fell into a violent melancholy, which introduced a lin|gering fever, of which he langui&s;hed 'till he was almo&s;t ready to drop into the ground. This cir|cum&s;tance reaching her Maje&s;ty's ear, &s;he was mov|ed with his di&s;tre&s;s. and &s;ent him word to endea|vour the recovery of his health, and as &s;oon as he was able to appear abroad, &s;he would &s;peak to him in a more favourable manner, than at their la&s;t interview. The duke upon receiving this news, imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nned it the be&s;t way to take the advantage of the kind di&s;po&s;ition her Maje&s;ty was in; and &s;ummoning to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance his little remain|ing &s;trength, he threw him&s;elf at her Maje&s;ty's feet, and begged of her either to give him Ma|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nmoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nelle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nbern, or not to order him to live, a&s;&s;ering her, in the language of tragedy, that &s;he was to pronounce the &s;entence of his life, or death. The Queen con&s;ented, but told him he would &s;oon repent it, and the young lady being dazzled with the lu&s;tre of a ducal title, and be|&s;ides
<PB N="273" REF="276">
having a real value for her lover, they were &s;oon united by an indi&s;&s;oluble bond.</P>
<P>After the &s;olemnization of his marriage, he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Rome, where he accepted of a blue garter, affected to appear with the title of duke of Northumberland, and for a|while enjoyed the confidence of the exiled Prince. But as he could not always keep him|&s;elf within the bounds of the Italian gravity, and having no employment to amu&s;e his active tem|per, he ran into his u&s;ual exce&s;&s;es, which giving offence, it was thought proper for him to remove from that city for the pre&s;ent, le&s;t he &s;hould fall into actual di&s;grace. Accordingly the duke quit|ted Rome, and went by &s;ea to Barcelona, where hearing that the trenches were opening before Gibraltar, he re&s;olved upon a new &s;cene of life, which few &s;u&s;pected he would ever engage in. He wrote a letter to the King of Spain, acquainting him, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he de&s;igned to take up arms in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and apprehending that his forces were going to reduce the town of Gi|braltar under his obedience, he hoped he &s;hould have his permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the &s;iege as a volunteer.'</Q></P>
<P>This done, he went to the camp, taking his duche&s;s along with him, and was received with all the marks of re&s;pect due to his quality. The Conde de la Torres, who commanded there, de|livered him an obliging letter from the King his ma&s;ter, thanking him for the honour he intended him, by &s;erving in his troops, and during that &s;iege, appointed him his aid-de-camp, by which po&s;t the duke was to give an account of all tran&s;actions to his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, which obliged him to be often in the trenches, and to expo&s;e his per&s;on to imminent danger. During this &s;iege want of courage was never imputed to him; on the contrary, he was often guilty of the mo&s;t im|prudent
<PB N="274" REF="277">
ra&s;hne&s;s. One evening he went clo&s;e to the walls, near one of the po&s;ts of the town, and threatened the &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on. They a&s;ked who he was? he readily an&s;wered, the duke of Wharton; and though he appeared there as an enemy, they &s;uffered him to return to the trench|es without firing one &s;hot at him.</P>
<P>This &s;iege was ended, and the duke received no other hurt, than a wound in his foot by the bur&s;t|ing of a grenade, and when nothing more was to be done in the camp, he went to court, where he was held in the utmo&s;t re&s;pect by the princi|pal nobility. The King likewi&s;e, as a mark of his favour, was plea&s;ed to give him a com|mi&s;&s;ion of Colonel Agregate (that was the term) to one of the Iri&s;h regiments, called Hibernia, and commanded by the marquis de Ca&s;telar.</P>
<P>Could the duke have been &s;atisfied with that &s;tate of life, and regulated his expences according to his income, he had it then in his power to live, if not affluently, at lea&s;t ea&s;ily. But in a &s;hort time he was for changing the &s;cene of action; he grew weary of Madrid, and &s;et his heart on Rome. In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, he wrote a letter to the Chevalier de St. George, full of re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire of vi&s;iting his court; but the Chevalier returned for an&s;wer, that he thought it more advi&s;able for his grace to draw near England, than make a tour to Rome, that he might be able to accom|modate matters with the government at home, and take &s;ome care of his per&s;onal e&s;tate. The Che|valier very prudently judged, that &s;o wretched an oeconomi&s;t as the duke, would be too great a burden to a per&s;on, who&s;e finances were not in a much better condition than his own. Be that as it may, the duke &s;eemed re&s;olved to follow his advice, and accordingly &s;et out for France, in

That gentleman returned the duke a civil an&s;wer, importing, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee his grace at his own time, if he intended it a pub|lic vi&s;it; if a private one, they would agree upon an hour, that &s;hould be mo&s;t convenient.'</Q> The duke declared that he would come publicly, which he did next day, and his di&s;cour&s;e with that mini&s;ter was &s;uitable to the u&s;ual gaiety of his temper; for though he &s;poke of returning home, it was in &s;uch an undetermined way, that Mr. Walpole could not gue&s;s his real intentions. He received the duke however with his u&s;ual com|plai&s;ance, and with a re&s;pect agreeable to his qua|lity, but was not a little &s;urprized, when, at par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n|ing, his grace told him, he was going to dine with the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter.

<P>The duke made little &s;tay at Paris, but pro|ceeded to Rouen in his way, as &s;ome imagined, to England; but there he &s;topt, and took up his re|&s;idence, without reflecting in the lea&s;t on the bu&s;ine&s;s that brought him to France.

and though every argument was u&s;ed to con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nince him of this error, at once &s;o obvious and fatal. yet he would hearken to no admonition while he had one crown left.</P>
<P>At Rouen, as in every other place, the duke charmed all tho&s;e who conver&s;ed with him; he was warmly received by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di|&s;tincti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nn in that province, with whom he took the diver&s;ion of hunting twice a week, 'till &s;ome news arrived, which would have given interrupti|on to the mirth of any other man; but the alte|ration was &s;carce to be perceived in him.</P>
<P>This was a Bill of Indictment preferred again&s;t Philip duke of Wharton, for high trea&s;on. The fact laid to his charge was, appearing in arms before, and firing off cannon again&s;t, his Maje&s;ty's town of Gibraltar. Here we cannot omit an anecdote, from which the reader may draw what conclu&s;ion he plea&s;es. During the time the pro|ceedings again&s;t the duke were at a &s;tand in the long vacation, a gentleman of character, intimate|ly acquainted with the duke, and al&s;o with his af|fairs in England; one who enjoyed the &s;un&s;hine of court favour, and was a Member of Parlia|ment, went over to Rouen to vi&s;it his grace, in company with another gentleman. The&s;e two vi&s;itants took a great deal of pains to per&s;uade him to &s;ubmit to the government, and re|turn to his e&s;tate, which they a&s;&s;ured him he might do, by writing a letter to the King, or the mi|ni&s;try. This alone, without any other preten&s;ions to favour, was to re-e&s;tabli&s;h him, and leave him the free enjoyment of his e&s;tate, which, notwith|&s;tanding all the reductions, would even then have yielded 6000 l. a year. This point they &s;ollicited ince&s;&s;antly, and their words of honour were given, to remove all &s;cruples his grace might have about the performance of the conditions. Their interpo&s;iti|ons were however in vain; he refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit
<PB N="277" REF="280">
to the mini&s;try, or write to the King, and thought it beneath him to a&s;k a favour.</P>
<P>This conduct of the duke may be imputed, by &s;ome, to pride and ob&s;tinacy, but a more natural con&s;truction is, that he was afraid of treachery. He could not di&s;cover upon what motives, two per&s;ons whom he looked upon as creatures of the court, would give them&s;elves the trouble to come to Rouen, in order to per&s;uade him to act for his own intere&s;t, unle&s;s they had &s;ome concealed views of &s;uch a nature, perhaps, as would prove fatal to him, &s;hould he &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>He &s;oon after this received advice from Eng|land, that his tru&s;tees could remit him no more of his annuity, on account of the indictment pre|ferred again&s;t him. There was now a dreadful pro&s;pect before him; his money was wa&s;ted; all future &s;upplies cut off; and there was a large fa|mily to &s;upport, without any hopes of relief. He began now to feel the effects of the indictment, which he before held in &s;o much contempt; he complained of it as a rigorous proceeding, becau&s;e it laid him under a nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king a favour, and receiving it in a public manner, which he fancied neither con&s;i&s;tent with his honour, or re|putation. Thus exa&s;perated again&s;t the govern|ment, he wrote the memorable paper which he con|trived to get printed in Mi&s;t's Journal, under the colour of an account of Mirevais and Sultan Ezref, which contained &s;evere reflexions on the admini&s;tration. Mean time the duke's credit at Rouen began to &s;ink; he was attended every morning with a con&s;iderable levee, confi&s;ting of the trade&s;men of that city, who came with im|portunate faces to demand payment of their bills, which he di&s;charged by quitting Rouen, leaving his hor&s;es and equipage to be &s;old, and the money to be divided among them.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="281">
The duke, before this event, had thrown him&s;elf at the feet of the Chevalier de St. George, as the only po&s;&s;ible re&s;ource he had left. Accordingly he wrote him a mo&s;t moving letter, giving him a detail of his pre&s;ent &s;ufferings, very pathetically repre&s;ent|ing the di&s;tre&s;s to which he was reduced, and hum|bly imploring his protection, with what little a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance might be nece&s;&s;ary to enable him to &s;upport &s;uch a burthen of calamities, as he found otherwi&s;e too heavy to bear.</P>
<P>The duke having now returned to Paris, made a con&s;iderable reformation in his hou&s;hold affairs, and placed him&s;elf in a private family, while the duche&s;s went to a relation's at St. Germains. In the mean while the an&s;wer of the letter &s;ent to Rome came in its proper time, in which his imprudent conduct was repre&s;ented; but at the &s;ame time was touched with &s;o light and delicate a hand, that it gave the duke but little unea&s;ine&s;s. No hopes were given him, that he &s;hould be gratified in his extravagancies, or flattered in his levities; on the contrary he was told, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That as his pa&s;t conduct had not merited any favour, nothing but his future behaviour could recommend him to it.'</Q> The duke had &s;ufficient penetration to di&s;cover by this hint, that he was not likely to be abandoned, which was con&s;olation enough to one of his &s;anguine temper, in the then de&s;perate &s;ituation of his affairs.&mdash;The Chevalier de St. George &s;oon after &s;ent him 2000 l. for his &s;upport, of which he was no &s;ooner in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, than he &s;quandered it away in a cour&s;e of extravagance.

As a proof of this &s;trange temper we

&s;hall quote one in&s;tance among&s;t many in the words of the writer of his life, which will &s;erve to &s;hew the heedle&s;s profu&s;ion of that unaccountable noble|man. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'A young Iri&s;h lord of the duke's acquaintance, of a &s;weet obliging and generous di&s;po&s;ition, hap|pening to be at St. Germains, at the time his grace was paying a vi&s;it to his lady; the duke came to him one night, with an air of bu&s;ine&s;s, and told his lord&s;hip that an affair of importance called him in&s;tantly to Paris, in which no time was to be lo&s;t, wherefore he begged the favour of his lord&s;hip's coach. The young nobleman lent it very readily, but as the duke was &s;tepping into it, he added, that he &s;hould reckon it an additi|onal obligation, if his lord&s;hip would give him, his company: As the duke was alone, the young lord either could not, or would not, refu&s;e him. They went together for Paris, where they arrived about midnight. The duke's companion then &s;uppo&s;ing his grace's bu&s;ine&s;s might demand pri|vacy, offered to leave him and come again, when it &s;hould be fini&s;hed; but he a&s;&s;ured his lord&s;hip it was not nece&s;&s;ary; upon which they went upon the following frolic together. The fir&s;t thing to be done, was to hire a coach and four hor&s;es; the next to find out the mu&s;ic belonging to the Opera, &s;ix or eight of which his grace engaged at a &s;et price: The young lord could not imagine in what this would end; till they returned to St. Germains, which was at five the next morning; when the duke marching directly with his troop to the ca&s;tle, ordered them to &s;trike upon the &s;tairs. Then the plot broke out into execution, being no more than to &s;erenade &s;ome young ladies, near who&s;e apartments they then were.'</P><P>'This piece of extravagant gallantry being over, the duke per&s;uaded the young lord to go about a mile off, to Poi&s;&s;y, where an Engli&s;h gentleman

<P>It may &s;eem a &s;trange ob&s;ervation, but it is cer|tainly true, that the brute creation differs not more from the rational in many re&s;pects, than a man from him&s;elf: That by &s;uffering pa&s;&s;ions to u&s;urp the dominion of the &s;oul, human nature is &s;tript of its dignity, deba&s;ed to the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, and &s;till rendered more ignominious by the complica|tions of guilt.

Ob&s;erve him de&s;cending to the mo&s;t abject trifling, &s;tooping to the meane&s;t expedients, and the orator and &s;tate&s;man transformed to the vagabond and the wanderer.</P>
<P>No incident in this nobleman's life has been re|pre&s;ented more to his di&s;advantage, and is in it&s;elf more intere&s;ting than the following. The account which is here in&s;erted was &s;ent to a friend by the duke's expre&s;s order.</P>
<P>A Scots peer with whom both the duke, and the duche&s;s lived in great intimacy in Italy, happening to come to Paris, when the duke was there, they renewed their acquaintance and friend&s;hip, and for &s;ome time continued with mutual freedom, till the duke had rea&s;on to believe from what he heard from others, that the peer had boa&s;ted favours from the duche&s;s of Wharton.</P>
<P>This in&s;tance of wanton vanity, the duke could not help re&s;enting, though he often declared &s;ince the quarrel, that he never had the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the duche&s;s's honour. He re&s;olved therefore very prudently to call the Scots lord to an account, without letting him know it was for the duche&s;s or &s;o much as mentioning her name; accordingly he took occa&s;ion to do it in this manner.</P>
<P>It happened that the duke of Wharton and his lord&s;hip me: at a lady's whom they mutually vi&s;ited, and the duke dropping his glove by chance, his lord&s;hip took it up. and returned it to the duke; who thereupon a&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nd him if he would take it up in all it's forms? To which his lord&s;hip an&s;wered, yes, my lord, in all its forms.</P>
<P>Some days after, the duke gave a ball at St. Germains, to which he invited the Scots nobleman, and &s;ome per&s;on indi&s;cretely a&s;ked his grace whether he had forbid the duche&s;s's dancing with lord C&mdash;. This gave the duke fre&s;h rea&s;on to believe that the Scots peer had been admini&s;tring new grounds for his re&s;entment, by the wantonne&s;s of calumny. He
<PB N="282" REF="285">
di&s;&s;embled his unea&s;ine&s;s for the pre&s;ent, and very politely entertained the company till five o'clock in the morning, when he went away without the ceremony of taking leave; and the next news that was heard of him was from Paris, from whence he &s;ent a challenge to lord C&mdash;d, to follow him to Flanders.</P>
<P>The challenge was delivered by his &s;ervant, and was to this effect: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That his lord&s;hip might re|member his &s;aying he took up his glove in all its forms, which upon mature reflexion, his grace looked upon to be &s;uch an affront, as was not to be born, wherefore he de&s;ired his lord&s;hip to meet him at Valenciennes, where he would expect him with a friend and a pair of pi&s;tols; and on failure of his lord&s;hip's coming his grace would po&s;t him, &amp;c.'</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ervant who delivered the letter, did not keep its contents a &s;ecret; and lord C&mdash;d was taken into cu&s;tody, when he was about &s;etting out to meet his grace. All that remained then for his. lord&s;hip to do, was to &s;end a gentleman into Flan|ders, to acquaint the duke with what happened to him. His grace upon &s;eeing the gentleman, i|magining him to be his lord&s;hip's &s;econd, &s;poke to him in this manner; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sir, I hope my lord will favour me &s;o far as to let us u&s;e pi&s;tols, becau&s;e the wound I received in my foot before Gibraltar, in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;ables me from the &s;word.'</Q>Hereupon the gentleman replied with &s;ome emotion, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My lord duke, you might chu&s;e what you plea&s;e; my lord C&mdash;d will fight you with any weapon, from a &s;mall pin to a great cannon; but this is not the ca&s;e, my lord is under an arre&s;t, by order of the duke of Berwick.'</Q></P>
<P>His grace being thus di&s;appointed in the duel, and his money being almo&s;t &s;pent, he returned to Paris, and was al&s;o put under an arre&s;t till the af|fair was made up by the interpo&s;ition of the duke
<PB N="283" REF="286">
of Berwick, under who&s;e cognizance it properly came as Mar&s;hal of France.</P>
<P>The duke's behaviour on this occa&s;ion, &s;o far from being reproachable, &s;eems to be the mo&s;t manly action of his whole life. What man of &s;pirit would not re&s;ent the behaviour of another, who &s;hould boa&s;t of favours from his wife, e&s;pecial|ly when in all probability he never received any?</P>
<P>His grace's conducting the quarrel, &s;o as to &s;ave the reputation of his duche&s;s, by not &s;o much as having her name called in que&s;tion, was at once prudent, and tender; for whether a lady is guilty or no, if the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion is once rai&s;ed, there are detractors enough in the world ready to fix the &s;tain upon her. The Scots lord de&s;erved the &s;evere&s;t treatment, for living in &s;trict friend&s;hip with two per&s;ons of quality, and then with an in&s;idious cruelty endeavouring to &s;ow the &s;eeds of eternal di&s;cord be|tween them, and all to gratify a little vanity: Than &s;uch a conduct nothing can be more reproachable.</P>
<P>Not long after this adventure, a whim &s;eized the duke of going into a convent, in order to prepare for Ea&s;ter; and while he was there, he talked with &s;o much force and energy upon all points of religion, that the pious fathers beheld him with admiration. Mankind were for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pence, what would be the i&s;&s;ue of this new cour&s;e of life; but he &s;oon put an end to their &s;peculations by appear|ing again in the world, and running headlong into as wild cour&s;es of vice and extravagance, as he had ever before done. He had for a companion, a gentleman for whom he entertained a very high e&s;teem; but one who was as much an enemy as po&s;&s;ible to &s;uch a licentious behaviour. In another &s;ituation, our noble author would have found it a happine&s;s to be con&s;tantly attended by a per&s;on of his honour, probity, and good &s;en&s;e; but the duke's

&s;trange and unaccountable conduct, rendered the be&s;t endeavours to &s;erve him ineffectual. In a letter which that gentleman wrote to a friend in London, he concludes with a melancholy repre&s;entation of the duke's pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes"><P>'&mdash;However, notwith&s;tanding what I have &s;uffered, and what my brother madman has done to undo him&s;elf, and every body who was &s;o un|lucky as to have the lea&s;t concern with him, I could not help being &s;en&s;ibly m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nved on &s;o extra|ordinary a vici&s;&s;itude of fortune, to &s;ee a great man fallen from that &s;hining light, in which I have beheld him in the hou&s;e of lords, to &s;uch a de|gree of ob&s;curity, that I have beheld the meane&s;t commoner here decline his company; and the Jew he would &s;ometimes fa&s;ten on, grow tired of it, for you know he is a bad orator in his cups, and of late he has been &s;eldom &s;ober. A week before he left Paris, he was &s;o reduced, that he had not one &s;ingle crown at command, and was forced to thru&s;t in with any acquaintance for a lodging: Wal&s;h and I have had him by turns, all to avoid a crowd of duns, which he had of all &s;izes, from 1400 livres to 4, who hunted him &s;o clo&s;e, that he was forced to retire to &s;ome of the neighbouring villages for &s;afety. I, &s;ick as I was, hurried about Paris to get him money, and to St. Cermains to get him linen.

<P>In this deplorable &s;ituation did the duke leave Paris, an in&s;tance indeed of the &s;trange rever&s;e of fortune, but for which he could not blame the &s;everity of providence, or the per&s;ecution of ene|mies, but his own unbounded profu&s;ion, a &s;lave to which he &s;eems to have been born. As a long journey did not very well &s;uit with his grace's fi|nances, &s;o he went for Orleans, thence fell down the river Loire to Nantz in Britany, and there he &s;topt &s;ome time 'till he got a remittance from Pa|ris, which was &s;quandered almo&s;t as &s;oon as re|ceived. At Nantz &s;ome of his ragged &s;ervants re|joined him, and from thence he took &s;hipping with them from Bilboa, as if he had been carry|ing recruits to the Spani&s;h regiment. From Bil|boa he wrote a humorous letter to a friend at Paris, &s;uch as his fancy, not his circum&s;tances, dictated, giving a whim&s;ical account of his voyage, and his manner of pa&s;&s;ing away his time. But at the end, as if he had been a little affected with his late mi&s;conduct, he concludes thus, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'notwith|&s;tanding what the world may &s;ay of me,<Q><L>' Be kind to my remains, and O! defend,</L>

<P>When the duke arrived at Bilboa, he had neither friends, money, nor credit, more than what the reputation of his Spani&s;h commi&s;&s;ion procured him. Upon the &s;trength of that he left his duchne&s;s and &s;ervant there, and went to his regiment, where he was obliged to &s;up|port him&s;elf upon the pay of 18 pi&s;toles a month, but could get no relief for the poor la|dy and family he left behind him. The di&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="286" REF="289">
of the duche&s;s was inexpre&s;&s;ible, nor is it ea&s;y to conceive what would have been the con&s;e|quence, if her unhappy circum&s;tances had not reached the ear of another exiled nobleman at Madrid, who could not hear of her &s;ufferings without relieving her. This generous exile, touch|ed with her calamities, &s;ent her a hundred Spa|ni&s;h pi&s;toles, which relieved her grace from a kind of captivity, and enabled her to come to Ma|drid, where &s;he lived with her mother and grand|mother, while the duke attended his regiment. Not long after this, the duke's family had a great lo&s;s in the death of his lady's mother, by which they were deprived of a pen&s;ion they before en|joyed from the crown of Spain; but this was for|tunately repaired by the intere&s;t of a nobleman at court, who procured the duche&s;s's two &s;i&s;ters to be minuted down for Maids of Honour to the Queen of Spain, whenever a vacancy &s;hould hap|pen, but to enter immediately upon the &s;alary of the&s;e places.

<P>There have been many in&s;tances of people, who have &s;u&s;tained the greate&s;t &s;hocks which adver&s;ity can inflict, through a whole life of &s;uffering, and yet at la&s;t have yielded to the influence of a tri|fling evil: &s;omething like this was the ca&s;e of the duke of Wharton, which the following &s;tory will illu&s;trate.</P>
<P>He was in garri&s;on at Barcelona, and coming from a ball one night, in company with &s;ome ladies, a man in a ma&s;que, whom he did not know, was guilty of &s;ome rudene&s;s to him. The duke enquired who he was, and being informed that he was valet de chambre to the marquis de Ri|&s;bourg, governour of Catalonia, he &s;uffered him|&s;elf to be tran&s;ported by the fir&s;t motions of his pa&s;&s;ion, and caned him. The fellow complained of this u&s;age to his ma&s;ter, who at fir&s;t took no
<PB N="287" REF="290">
notice of it, imagining his grace would make &s;ome excu&s;e to him for &s;uch a procedure; but whether the duke thought it beneath his quality to make any apology for beating a menial &s;er|vant, who had been rude to him, or would not do it upon another account, he &s;poke not a word about it. The marquis re&s;enting this behaviour, two days after ordered the duke to pri&s;on. He obeyed, and went to Fort Montjuich: as &s;oon as he arrived there, the marquis fent him word, he might come out when he plea&s;ed; the duke an|&s;wered, he &s;corned to accept liberty at his hands, and would not &s;tir without an order from the court, imagining they would highly condemn the governour's conduct; but the marquis had too much credit with the mini&s;ter, to &s;uffer any di|minution of his power on that account; he received only a &s;harp rebuke, and the duke had orders to repair to his quarters, without entering again into Barcelona. This la&s;t mortification renewed the remembrance of all his misfortunes; he &s;unk be|neath this accident, and giving way to melancho|ly, fell into a deep con&s;umption. Had the duke maintained his u&s;ual &s;pirit, he would probably have challenged the marquis, and revenged the affront of the &s;ervant upon the ma&s;ter, who had made the quarrel his own, by re&s;enting the valet's de|&s;erved correction.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1731 he de|clined &s;o fa&s;t, being in his quarters, at Lerida, that he had not the u&s;e of his limbs, &s;o as to move without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but as he was free from pain, he did not lo&s;e all his gaiety. He continued in this ill &s;tate of health for two months, when he gained a little &s;trength, and found &s;ome be|nefit from a certain mineral water in the moun|tains of Catalonia; but his con&s;titution was too much &s;pent to recover the &s;hocks it had received. He relap&s;ed the May following at Terragana, whi|ther
<PB N="288" REF="291">
he removed with his regiment; and going to the above mentioned waters, the bene&s;it whereof he had already experienced, he fell into one of tho&s;e fainting fits, to which he had for &s;ome time been &s;ubject, in a &s;mall village, and was utterly de&s;titute of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, 'till &s;ome charitable fathers of a Bernardine convent, offer|ed him what a&s;&s;i&s;tance their hou&s;e afforded. The duke accepted their kind propo&s;al, upon which they removed him to their convent, and admini|&s;tered all the relief in their power. Under this ho&s;pitable roof, after langui&s;hing a week, died the duke of Wharton, without one friend, or acquain|tance to clo&s;e his eyes. His funeral was perform|ed in the &s;ame manner in which the fathers inter tho&s;e of their own fraternity.</P>
<P>Thus we have endeavoured to exhibit an a|dequate picture of the duke of Wharton, a man who&s;e life was as &s;trongly chequered with the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, as his abilities were various and a&s;toni&s;hing. He is an in&s;tance of the great imbecility of intellectual powers, when once they &s;purn the dictates of prudence, and the maxims of life. With all the lu&s;tre of his under|&s;tanding, when his fortune was wa&s;ted, and his circum&s;tances low, he fell into contempt; they who formerly wor&s;hipped him, fied from him, and de&s;pi&s;ed his wit when attended with poverty. So true is it that,<Q><L>Wants is the &s;corn of every wealthy fool,</L>
<L>And wit in rags is turn'd to ridicule.</L></Q></P>
<P>The duke of Wharton &s;eems to have lived as if the world &s;hould be new modelled for him; for he would conform to none of the rules, by which the little happine&s;s the world can yield, is to be attained. But we &s;hall not here enlarge on his character, as we can pre&s;ent it to the reader, drawn in the mo&s;t lively manner, by the ma&s;ter|ly

<HEAD>Sir ROGER L'ESTRANGE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was &s;econd &s;on of Sir Hammon L'E&s;trange of Hun&s;ton in Nor|folk, knt. and was born anno 1617<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gen. Dict. Art. L'E&s;trange.</NOTE>. In the year 1644 Sir Roger having obtained a commi&s;&s;ion from King Charles I. for reducing Lynne in Nor|folk, then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Parliament, his de|&s;ign was di&s;covered to colonel Walton the gover|nour, and his per&s;on &s;eized. Upon the failing of this enterprize he was tried by a court-martial at Guildhall, London, and condemned to lo&s;e his life as a &s;py, coming from the King's quarters without drum, trumpet, or pa&s;s; but was afterwards reprieved, and continued in Newgate &s;everal years. Sir Roger in a work of his, called Truth and Loyalty Vindicated, has informed us, that, when he received &s;entence of death, which was pro|nounced again&s;t him by Dr. Mills, then judge ad|vocate, and afterwards chancellor to the bi&s;hop of Norwich, he was ca&s;t into Newgate, where he was vi&s;ited by Mr. Thorowgood and Mr. Arrow&s;mith, two members of the a&s;&s;embly of divines, who kind|ly offered him their utmo&s;t intere&s;t if he would make &s;ome petitionary acknowledgment, and &s;ub|mit to take the covenant, which he refu&s;ed. But
<PB N="296" REF="299">
that he might obtain a reprieve, he wrote &s;everal letters to the earl of Northumberland, the earl of Stamford, and others of the nobility, from whom he received favours. In the Hou&s;e of Commons he was particularly obliged to Sir John Corbet, and Sir Henry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nholmondley. He was reprieved in order to a further hearing; but after almo&s;t thirty months &s;pent in vain endeavours, either to come to a hearing, or to put him&s;elf into an exchangeable condition, he printed a &s;tate of his ca&s;e, as an Appeal from the Court-martial to the Parliament, dated at Newgate in 1647.</P>
<P>After almo&s;t four years impri&s;onment, with his keeper's privity, he &s;lipt into Kent, and then with much difficulty got beyond &s;ea. About the latter end of Augu&s;t 1653, upon the di&s;&s;olution of the Long Par|liament, by Cromwel, he returned into England, and pre&s;ently acquainted the council, then &s;itting at Whitehall, that finding him&s;elf within the Act of Indemnity, he thought it his duty to give them notice of his return. Soon after this he was &s;erved with the following order,<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day September 7, 1655.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Ordered,</P>
<P>That Roger L'E&s;trange be &s;ent unto, to attend the committee of this council for examination.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JOHN THURLOE, Secretary.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This order laid him under a nece&s;&s;ity of attend|ing for his di&s;charge, but perceiving his bu&s;ine&s;s to advance very &s;lowly, and his father at that time lying upon his death-bed, he was &s;ollicitous to have his di&s;charge as much ha&s;tened as po&s;&s;ible, that he might pay his duty to his father, whom he had not &s;een for many years before. Mr. Strick|land was one of the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to
<PB N="297" REF="300">
examine him, and the per&s;on from whom, in the judgment of his friends, he was to expect the lea&s;t favour. Mr. L'E&s;trange therefore to render him more propitious to his purpo&s;e, paid him the com|pliment of a vi&s;it, telling him frankly that he was returned upon the invitation of the Act of Indem|nity; and laying before him how much it con|cerned him, both in comfort and intere&s;t, to &s;ee his dying father. Mr. Strickland, in place of complying with Mr. L'E&s;trange's propo&s;ition, an|&s;wered, that he would find him&s;elf mi&s;taken, and that his ca&s;e was not included in that Act. Mr. L'E&s;trange's reply to him was, <Q REND="inline">'that he might have been &s;afe among the Turks upon the &s;ame terms;'</Q> and &s;o he left him. From that time matters be|ginning to look wor&s;e and wor&s;e, he con&s;idered it, as his la&s;t expedient, to addre&s;s Cromwel him&s;elf. After &s;everal di&s;appointments, for want of oppor|tunity, he &s;poke to him at la&s;t in the Cock-pit, and the &s;um of his de&s;ire was, either a &s;peedy ex|amination, or that it might be deferred 'till he had &s;een his father. Cromwel remon&s;trated again&s;t the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of his party, ob&s;erved, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that rigour was not his inclination, but that he was but one man, and could do little by him&s;elf; and that Mr. L'E&s;trange's party would do well to give &s;ome better te&s;timony of their quiet, and peaceable in|tentions.'</Q> Mr. L'E&s;trange told him, <Q REND="inline">'that every man was to an&s;wer for his own actions, at his own peril;'</Q> and &s;o Cromwel took his leave. Some time after this Mr. L'E&s;trange was called, and Mr. Strickland, with another gentleman, were his ex|aminers; but the latter pre&s;&s;ed nothing again&s;t him. Mr. Strickland indeed in&s;i&s;ted upon his condem|nation, and would have deprived him of the benefit of the Act of Indemnity, telling him at la&s;t, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that he had given no evidence of the change of his mind, and con&s;equently was not to be tru&s;ted.'</Q> Mr. L'E&s;trange's final an&s;wer was to this effect, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that
<PB N="298" REF="301">
it was his intere&s;t to change his opinion, if he could, and that whenever he found rea&s;on &s;o to do, he would obey the &s;en&s;e of his own mind.'</Q> Some few days after this he was di&s;charged<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Truth and Loyalty, ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'During the dependency of this affair (&s;ays Mr. L'E&s;trange) I might well be &s;een at Whitehall, but that I &s;pake to Cromwel on any other bu&s;ine&s;s than this, that I either &s;ought, or pretended to, any privacy with him, or that I ever &s;pake to him after this time, I ab&s;olutely di&s;own. Con|cerning the &s;tory of the fiddle<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Roger L'E&s;trange was called, by way of deri&s;ion, Cromwell's Fidler.</NOTE>, this I &s;uppo&s;e might be the ri&s;e of it: being in St. James's Park, I heard an organ touched in a little low room of one Mr. Henck&s;on's; I went in, and found a private company of &s;ome five or &s;ix per&s;ons. They de&s;ired me to take up a Viol, and bear a part. I did &s;o, and that part too, not much advance to the reputation of my cunning. By and by, without the lea&s;t colour of de&s;ign, or expectation, in comes Cromwel. He found us playing, and, as I remember, &s;o he left us.&mdash;As to bribing of his attendants, I di&s;claim it. I never &s;pake to Thurloe, but once in my life, and that was about my di&s;charge. Nor did I ever give bribe, little or great, in the family.'</Q></P>
<P>The above declaration Sir Roger was obliged to make, as &s;ome of his enemies wanted to turn tho&s;e circum&s;tances of favour he received from the Oliverian government to his di&s;advantage, and pre|vent his ri&s;ing in court di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Sir Roger having little paternal fortune, and being a man rather profu&s;e than oeconomical, he had recour&s;e to writing for bread. After the re|&s;toration he &s;et up a news paper, which was con|tinued 'till the Gazette was fir&s;t &s;et on foot by Sir Jo&s;eph William&s;on, under &s;ecretary of &s;tate,
<PB N="299" REF="302">
for which, however, the government allowed Mr. L'E&s;trange a con&s;ideration. Mr. Wood informs us, that our author publi&s;hed his paper twice every week in 4to. under the title of The Public Intelligence and News; the fir&s;t of which came out Augu&s;t the 31&s;t, 1663, and the other September the 3d, the &s;ame year <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The&s;e continued till the 9th of Ja|nuary 1665, at which time Mr. L'E&s;trange de&s;i&s;t|ed, becau&s;e in the November before, there were other News-Papers publi&s;hed twice every week, in half a &s;heet in folio. The&s;e were called The Oxford Gazettes, and commenced the 7th of No|vember, 1665, the king and queen, with their courts being then at Oxford. The&s;e for a little while were written by one Henry Muddeman; but when the court removed to London, they were called the London Gazette. Soon after Mr. Jo&s;eph William&s;on, under &s;ecretary of State, pro|cured the writing of them for him&s;elf; and there|upon employed Charles Perrot, M. A. and fellow of Oriel College in Oxford, who had a good command of his pen, to do that office under him, and &s;o he did, though not con&s;tantly, till about 1671; after which time they were con&s;tantly written by under &s;ecretaries, belonging to tho&s;e that are principal, and do continue &s;o to this day.'</Q></P>
<P>Soon after the popi&s;h plot, when the Tories be|gan to gain the a&s;cendant over the Whigs, Mr. L'E&s;trange became a zealous promoter of the Tory intere&s;t. He &s;et up a paper called the Ob&s;ervator, in which he defended the court, and endeavoured to invalidate tho&s;e evidences which were given by Oates's party again&s;t the Je&s;uits. He likewi&s;e wrote a pamphlet, in which he attempts to prove, that Sir Edmundbury Godfrey's murther, for which &s;o many &s;uffered, and &s;o great a flame was rai&s;ed in the nation, was really perpetrated by him&s;elf. He attempts to &s;hew that Sir Edmundbury was a melancholy enthu|&s;ia&s;tic
<PB N="300" REF="303">
man; that he was weak in his under&s;tanding, and ab&s;urd in his conduct. The activity he di&s;covered in Oates's plot, had rai&s;ed him to &s;uch reputation, that he was unable to bear it, and therefore the na|tural enthu&s;ia&s;m of his temper prompted him to make him&s;elf a &s;acrifice, from a view of advancing the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, as he knew his murther would be charged upon the Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mr. L'E&s;trange's rea&s;oning, being only conjec|tural, and very improbable, is therefore far from conclu&s;ive: It is certain that there never was a more intricate affair than this. We have read the trials of all tho&s;e who &s;uffered for this murther, chiefly upon the evidence of one Prance, and one Bedloe, who pretended to have been accomplices; but their relation is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent; their characters &s;o very infamous, and their reward for being evidences &s;up|po&s;ed to be &s;o con&s;iderable, that the mo&s;t candid en|quirer after truth, can determine nothing po&s;itively concerning it. All who &s;uffered for the popi&s;h plot, denied their knowledge of it; the four men who were executed, as being the perpetrators per&s;i&s;ted to the la&s;t in prote&s;ting their innocence of it. After all, the murther of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey is per|haps one of tho&s;e &s;ecrets, which will ever remain &s;o, till the hearts of all men are laid open.</P>
<P>The &s;ervices, which Mr. L'E&s;trange rendered the court, procured him the honour of knighthood; and he &s;erved as a member for Winche&s;ter, in the par|liament called by king James the IId. 1685. But things taking quite a different turn in that prince's reign, in point of liberty of con&s;cience, to what mo&s;t people expected, our author's Ob&s;ervators were dropt, as not being &s;uitable to the times. However he continued licen&s;er of the pre&s;s 'till the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of the prince of Orange to the throne; in who&s;e reign, on account of his Tory principles, and his attachment to his late ma&s;ter, he met with &s;ome troubles. He was &s;uffered however to de&s;cend
<PB N="301" REF="304">
to the grave in peace, though he had in a manner &s;urvived his under&s;tanding. He died December 12, 1705, in the 88th year of his age.</P>

<P>Mr. Gordon, author of the Independent Whig, and tran&s;lator of Tacitus, has very freely cen&s;ured L'E&s;trange.

<P>Sir Roger was but ill-rewarded by the Tories, for having been their champion; the latter part of his life was clouded with poverty, and though he de|&s;cended in peace to the grave, free from political turmo ls, yet as he was bowed down with age and di&s;tre&s;s, he cannot be &s;aid to have died in comfort.

<P>In honour to Mr. Smith it &s;hould be remembered, that when he &s;tood a candidate for one of the uni|ver&s;ities, at the We&s;tmin&s;ter election, he &s;o peculi|arly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his con&s;picuous per|formances, that there aro&s;e no &s;mall contention be|tween the repre&s;entative electors of Trinity-College in Cambridge, and Chri&s;t-Church College in Oxon, which of tho&s;e two i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\nlu&s;trious &s;ocieties &s;hould adopt him as their own. But the electors of Trinity Col|lege having the preference of choice that year, they re&s;olutely elected him; but being invited at the &s;ame time to Chri&s;t-Church, Mr. Smith cho&s;e to accept of a &s;tudent&s;hip there.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed through the exerci&s;es of the college, and the univer&s;ity, with unu&s;ual applau&s;e; and tho' he often &s;uffered his friends to call him off from his retirement; yet his return to his &s;tudies was &s;o much the more pa&s;&s;ionate, and his love of reading and thinking being &s;o vehement, the habit grew upon him, and the &s;eries of meditation and reflexion being kept up whole weeks together, he could bet|ter arrange his ideas, and take in &s;undry parts of a &s;cience at one view, without interruption or confu&s;ion. Some of his acquaintance, who were plea&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h between the wit and the &s;cholar, extoll'd him altogether on account of the fir&s;t of the&s;e ex|cellencies; but others, who were more candid, ad|mired him as a prodigy in both. He had acquired reputation in the &s;chools, both as a philo&s;opher and polemic of exten&s;ive knowledge, and deep penetration, and went through all the cour&s;es with a proper regard to the dignity, and importance of each &s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="308">
Mr. Smith had a long and perfect intimacy with all the Greek and Latin Cla&s;&s;ics; with whom he had indu&s;triou&s;ly compared whatever was worth pe|ru&s;ing in the French, Spani&s;h, and Italian, and all the celebrated writers in his own country. He con|&s;idered the antients and moderns, not as parties, or rivals for fame, but as architects upon one and the &s;ame plan, the Art of Poetry. If he did not always commend the compo&s;itions of others, it proceeded not from ill-nature (for that was foreign to his temper) but a &s;trict regard to ju&s;tice would not &s;uffer him to call a few flowers elegantly adorned, without much art, and le&s;s genius, by &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a name as poetry. He was of Ben John&s;on's opinion, who could not admire,<Q><L>&mdash;Ver&s;es, as &s;mooth and &s;oft as cream,</L>

<P>Mr. Smith's Bodleian Oration, printed with his other works, though taken from a remote and im|perfect copy, has &s;hewn the world, how great a ma&s;ter he was of Ciceronian Eloquence. Since Temple and Ro&s;common (&s;ays Mr. Oldi&s;worth) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'No man under&s;tood Horace better, e&s;pecially as to his happy diction, rolling numbers, beautiful imagery, and alternate mixture of the &s;oft and &s;ublime. His friend Mr. Philips's Ode to Mr. St. John, after the manner of Horace's Lu&s;ory, or Amatorian Odes, is certainly a ma&s;ter-piece: But Mr. Smith's Pocockius is of the &s;ublimer kind; though like Waller's writings upon Crom|well, it wants not the mo&s;t delicate and &s;urprizing turns, peculiar to the per&s;on prai&s;ed.'</Q></P>
<P>He was an excellent judge of humanity, and &s;o good a hi&s;torian, that in familiar conver&s;ation, he would talk over the mo&s;t memorable facts in anti|quity;

the lives, actions, and characters of cele|brated men, with amazing facility and accuracy. As he had carefully read and di&s;tingui&s;hed Thuanus's works, &s;o he was able to copy after him: And his talent in this kind was &s;o generally confe&s;s'd, that he was made choice of by &s;ome great men, to write a hi&s;tory, which it was their intere&s;t to have execut|ed with the utmo&s;t art, and dexterity; but this de|&s;ign was dropp'd, as Mr. Smith would not &s;acrifice truth to the caprice, and intere&s;ted views of a party.</P>
<P>Our author's Poem, condoling the death of Mr. Philips, is full of the noble&s;t beauties, and pays a ju&s;t tribute to the venerable a&s;hes of that great man. Mr. Smith had contracted for Mr. Philips the mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip, a pa&s;&s;ion of which he was very &s;a&s;ceptible, and who&s;e laws he con&s;idered as &s;acred and inviolable.</P>
<P>In the year 1707 Mr. Smith's Tragedy called Phae|dra and Hippolitus was acted at the Theatre-Royal. This play was introduced upon the &s;tage, at a time when the Italian Opera &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed the at|tention of the polite world, that &s;en&s;e was &s;acrificed to &s;ound. It was dre&s;s'd and decorated, at an ex|traordinary expence:&mdash;and inimitably perform'd in all its parts, by Betterton, Booth, Barry, and Oldfield. Yet it brought but few, and &s;lender audi|ences.&mdash;To &s;ay truth, 'twas a fine Poem; but not an extraordinary Play. Notwith&s;tanding the intrin&s;ic merit of this piece, and the countenance it met with from the mo&s;t ingenious men of the age, yet it lan|gui&s;hed on the &s;tage, and was &s;oon neglected. Mr. Addi&s;on wrote the Prologue, in which he rallies the vitiated ta&s;te of the public, in preferring the unideal entertainment of an Opera, to the genuine &s;en&s;e of a Briti&s;h Poet.<Q><PB N="307" REF="310"><LG TYPE="prologue">

</LG></Q></P>
<P>We have been induced to tran&s;cribe the&s;e lines of Mr. Addi&s;on, in order to have the plea&s;ure of pro|ducing &s;o great an authority in favour of the Engli&s;h drama, when placed in contradi&s;tinction to an en|tertainment, exhibited by Eunuchs and Fidlers, in a language, of which the greate&s;t part of the audi|ence are ignorant; and from the nature of which no moral in&s;truction can be drawn.</P>
<P>The chief excellence of this play certainly con|&s;i&s;ts in the beauty and harmony of the ver&s;ification. The language is luxuriantly poetical. The pa&s;&s;ion of Phaedra for her hu&s;band's &s;on has been con&s;ider|ed by &s;ome critics as too unnatural to be &s;hewn on the &s;tage; and they have ob&s;erved that the poet would have written more &s;ucce&s;sfully if he had con|verted
<PB N="308" REF="311">
the &s;on into a brother. Poetical ju&s;tice is carefully di&s;tributed; Phaedra and Lycon are ju&s;tly made the &s;ufferers, while Hippolitus and I&s;mena e&s;cape the vengeance of The&s;eus. The play is not de&s;titute of the pathetic, tho' much more regard is paid to the purity and elegance of the language, than a poet more acquainted with the workings of the heart would have done. We &s;hall give an example to illu&s;trate this ob&s;ervation. When The&s;eus reproaches Hippolitus for his love to I&s;mena, and at the &s;ame time dooms him as the victim of his revenge and jealou&s;y, he u&s;es the&s;e words,<Q><L>Can&s;t thou be only clear'd by di&s;obedience,</L>
<L>And ju&s;tified by crimes?&mdash;What! love my foe!</L>
<L>Love one de&s;cended from a race of tyrants,</L>
<L>Who&s;e blood yet reeks on my avenging &s;word!</L>
<L>I'm cur&s;t each moment I delay thy fate:</L>
<L>Ha&s;te to the &s;hades, and tell the happy Pallas,</L>
<L>I&s;mena's flames, and let him ta&s;te &s;uch joys</L>
<L>As thou giv'&s;t me; go tell applauding Minos,</L>
<L>The pious love you bore his daughter Phaedra;</L>
<L>Tell it the chatt'ring gho&s;ts, and hi&s;&s;ing furies,</L>
<L>Tell it the grinning fiends, till Hell &s;ound nothing</L>
<L>To thy pleas'd ears, but Phaedra and I&s;mena.</L></Q></P>
<P>We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that a man wrought up to fury, by the flame of jealou&s;y, and a &s;en&s;e of a|fronted dignity, could be &s;o particular in giving his &s;on directions how to behave in hell, and to whom he &s;hould relate the &s;tory of his fate. When any pa&s;&s;ion violently overwhelms the &s;oul, the per&s;on who feels it, always &s;peaks &s;ententiou&s;ly, avoids repetitions, and is not capable of much recollection, at lea&s;t of making a minute detail of circum&s;tances. In how few words, and with greater force would Shake&s;pear have conducted this &s;peech of The&s;eus. An example will prove it: when Othello is inform|ed that Ca&s;&s;io is &s;lain, he replies,<Q><PB N="309" REF="312"><L>Had all his hairs been lives,</L>
<L>My great revenge had &s;tomach for them all.</L></Q></P>
<P>When Phaedra is made acquainted with the ruin of Hyppolitus, the poet makes her utter the following beautiful &s;peech, which, however, is liable to the &s;ame objection as the former, for it &s;eems rather a &s;tudied declamation, than an expre&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t agonizing throes &s;he is then &s;uppo&s;ed to experience.<Q><L>What's life?

<P>No man had a ju&s;ter notion of the difficulty of compo&s;ing, than Mr. Smith, and he &s;ometimes would create greater difficulties than he had rea|&s;on to apprehend. Mr. Smith had, indeed, &s;ome defects in his conduct, which tho&s;e are more apt to remember, who could imitate him in nothing el&s;e. Among&s;t the blemi&s;hes of an innocent kind,
<PB N="310" REF="313">
which attended Mr. Smith, was his extreme care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s in the particular of dre&s;s; this oddity pro|cured him the name of Captain Ragg. His per|&s;on was &s;o well formed, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much natural gracefulne&s;s, that notwith&s;tanding the di&s;|advantage of his appearance, he was called, by the Ladies, the Hand&s;ome Sloven.</P>
<P>It is to be wondered at (&s;ays Mr. Oldi&s;worth) that a man under poverty, calamities, and di&s;|appointments, could make &s;o many friends, and tho&s;e &s;o truly valuable. He had, indeed, a noble idea of the pa&s;&s;ion of friend&s;hip, in the &s;ucce&s;s of which, con&s;i&s;ted the greate&s;t, if not the only hap|pine&s;s of his Life. He was &s;erene and chearful under the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence; he avoided having any dealings with mankind in which he could not be ju&s;t, and therefore refu&s;ed to em|brace &s;ome opportunities of amending his fortune.</P>
<P>Upon Mr Smith's coming to town, no man was more &s;urrounded by all tho&s;e who really had, or pretended to wit, or more courted by the great men, who had then a power and opportunity of encouraging arts and &s;ciences. Mr. Smith's cha|racter grew upon his friends by intimacy, and ex|ceeded the &s;tronge&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which had been conceived in his favour. A few years before his death, Mr. Smith engaged in &s;ome con&s;iderable Undertakings; in all which he rai&s;ed expectations in the world, which he lived not to gratify. Mr. Oldi&s;|worth ob&s;erves, that he had &s;een about ten &s;heets of Pindar tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, which, he &s;ays, exceeded any thing of that kind, he could ever hope for in our language. He had drawn out a plan for a tragedy of Lady Jane Grey, and had written &s;everal &s;cenes of it: a &s;ubject after|wards nobly executed by Mr. Rowe. His great|e&s;t undertaking was Longinus, which he executed in a very ma&s;terly manner. He propo&s;ed a large addition to this work, of notes and ob&s;ervations
<PB N="311" REF="314">
of his own, with an intire &s;y&s;tem of the art of poetry in three books, under the title of Thoughts, Action, and Figure; in this work he propo&s;ed to reform the art of Rhetoric, by reducing that confu&s;ed heap of Terms, with which a long &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of Pedants had incumbered the world, to a very narrow compa&s;s; comprehending all that was u&s;eful and ornamental in poetry under each head, and chapter. He intended to make remarks upon all the ancients and moderns, the Greek, Latin, Engli&s;h. French, Spani&s;h, and Italian po|ets, and to anamadvert upon their &s;everal beauties and defects.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith died in the year 1710, in the 42d of his age, at the &s;eat of George Ducket <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> called Hartham, in Wilt&s;hire; and was buried in the pari&s;h church there. We &s;hall give the cha|racter of this celebrated poet in the words of Mr. Oldi&s;worth:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He had a quickne&s;s of apprehen|&s;ion and vivacity of under&s;tanding, which ea&s;ily took in, and &s;urmounted, the mo&s;t knotty parts of methematics and metaphy&s;ics. His wit was prompt and flowing, yet &s;olid and piercing; his ta&s;te delicate, his head clear, and his manner of expre&s;&s;ing his thoughts per&s;picuous, and en|gaging; an eager, but generous, emulation grew up in him, which pu&s;h'd him upon &s;triving to excel in every art and &s;cience, that could make him a credit to his college: and it was his happine&s;s to have &s;everal cotemporaries, and fellow &s;tudents, who exerci&s;ed and excited this virtue in them&s;elves and others: his judg|ment naturally good, &s;oon ripened into an ex|quifite finene&s;s, and di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;agacity, which as it was active and bu&s;y, &s;o it was vigo|rons and manly, keeping even pace with a rich and &s;trong imagination, always on the wing, and never tired with a&s;piring; there are many of his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays in oratory, in epigram,

Mr. Smith, no doubt, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t genius for poetry; but it is certain he had mixed but too lit|tle in life. His language, however luxuriou&s;ly po|etical, yet is far from being proper for the drama, and there is too much of the poet in every &s;peech he puts in the mouths of his characters, which pro|duces an uniformity, that nothing could teach him to avoid, but a more general knowledge of real life and characters. It is acknowledged that Mr. Smith was much inclined to intemperance, though Mr. Oldi&s;|worth has glo&s;&s;ed it over with the hand of a friend; nor is it improbable, that this di&s;po&s;ition &s;unk him in that vis inertiae, which has been the bane of many of the brighte&s;t geniu&s;es of the world. Mr. Smith was, upon the whole, a good natured man, a great poet, a fini&s;hed &s;cholar, and a di&s;cerning critic.</P>

<P>The next &s;atire of any con&s;equence which De Foe wrote, was entitled Reformation of Manners, in which &s;ome private characters are &s;everely at|tacked. It is chiefly aimed at &s;ome per&s;ons, who being ve&s;ted with authority to &s;uppre&s;s vice, yet rendered them&s;elves a di&s;grace to their country, en|couraging wickedne&s;s by that very authority they have to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>Poetry was far from being the talent of De Foe. He wrote with more per&s;picuity and &s;trength in pro&s;e, and he &s;eems to have under&s;tood, as well
<PB N="316" REF="319">
as any man, the civil con&s;titution of the kingdom, which indeed was his chief &s;tudy.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t volume of his works there is a pro&s;e e&s;&s;ay, which he entitles The Original Power of the Collective Body of the People of England, Exa|mined and A&s;&s;erted; this was intended to refute a very ridiculous opinion, which politicians, more zealous than wi&s;e, had indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, viz. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the repre&s;entatives of the people, i. e. the Hou&s;e of Commons had a right to enact what|ever laws, and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\ner into whatever mea&s;ures they plea&s;e, without any dependence on, or even con|&s;ulting the opinion of, their con&s;tituents; and that the collective body of the people have no right to call them to an account, or to take a|ny cognizance of their conduct.'</Q> In an&s;wer to which Mr. De Foe very &s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that it is po&s;&s;ible for even a Hou&s;e of Commons to be in the wrong. They may be mi&s;&s;ed by factions and parties, and it is as ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e them in|fallible, as to &s;uppo&s;e the Pope of Rome, or the Popi&s;h conclave infallible, which have more than once determined again&s;t one another. It is po&s;&s;ible (&s;ays he) for them to be bribed by pen&s;ions and places, and by either of tho&s;e extremes to betray their tru&s;t, and abu&s;e the people who entru&s;t them; and if the people &s;hould have no redre&s;s in &s;uch a ca&s;e, then would the nation be in hazard of being ruined by their own repre&s;entatives. And it is a wonder to find it a&s;&s;erted in a certain treati&s;e, <HI>That it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that ever the Hou&s;e of Commons can injure the people who entru&s;t them.</HI> There can be no better way to demon|&s;trate the po&s;&s;ibility of a thing, than by proving that it has been already; and we need go no further back than to the reign of King Charles II. in which we have &s;een li&s;ts of 180 mem|bers, who received private pen&s;ions from the
<PB N="317" REF="320">
court; and if any body &s;hould a&s;k whether that parliament pre&s;erved the ballance of power in the three branches of our con&s;titution, in the due di&s;tribution &s;ome have mentioned? I am not a|fraid to an&s;wer in the negative. And why, even to this day, are gentlemen &s;o fond of &s;pending their e&s;tates to fit in the Hou&s;e, that ten thou|&s;and pounds have been &s;pent at a time to be cho|&s;en, and now that way of procuring elections is at an end, private briberies, and clande&s;tine con|trivances are made u&s;e of to get into the Hou&s;e? No man would give a groat to &s;it, where he can|not get a groat him&s;elf for &s;itting, unle&s;s there were either parties to gratify, profits to be made, or intere&s;t to &s;upport. In this ca&s;e it is plain a people may be ruined by their repre&s;entatives, and the fir&s;t law of nature, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, give the people a right to re&s;ent public encroach|ments upon their valuable liberties.'</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ame volume is a tract entitled The Shorte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;enters, which contained reflexions again&s;t &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tics in power, for breathing too much a &s;pirit of per&s;ecution. He be|came obnoxious to the mini&s;try on this account, and was obliged to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by writing an explanation of it. Mr. De Foe in his preface to the &s;econd volume of his works, collected by him&s;elf, takes occa&s;ion to mention the &s;evere hard&s;hips he laboured under, occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e Printers, more indu&s;trious than him&s;elf, who make a practice of pirating every work attended with &s;ucce&s;s. As an in&s;tance of this kind of oppre&s;&s;ion, he mentions the True Born Engli&s;hman, by which, had he en|joyed the full profit of his own labours, he mu&s;t have gained near a thou&s;and pounds; for be&s;ides nine editions which pa&s;&s;ed under his own in&s;pec|tion, this poem was twelve times pirated: but the in&s;olence of tho&s;e fraudulent dealers did not &s;top
<PB N="318" REF="321">
here. A Printer of a bad reputation collected a &s;purious and erroneous copy of &s;everal pieces of De Foe, and entitled them The Works of the Au|thor of the True Born Engli&s;hman; and though he was then embroiled with the government for one of the pamphlets which this collection con|tained, yet had this man the impudence to print among&s;t them the &s;ame pamphlets, pre&s;uming &s;o far upon the partiality of the public re&s;entment, that he &s;hould pa&s;s with impunity for publi&s;hing that very thing for which the author was to be pro|&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. This, however, was an irre&s;i&s;tible te&s;timony, that the re&s;entment &s;hewn to the author was on &s;ome other, and le&s;s ju&s;tifiable account, than the publication of that book; &s;o was it a &s;evere &s;atire on the unwarine&s;s of the mini&s;try, who had not eyes to di&s;cern their ju&s;tice plainly expo&s;ed, and their general proceed|ings bantered by a Printer, for publi&s;hing in de|fiance of them that &s;ame book for which another man &s;tood arraigned.</P>
<P>Mr. De Foe, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a re&s;olute temper, and a mo&s;t confirmed fortitude of mind, was never awed by the threats of power, nor deterred from &s;peaking truth by the in&s;olence of the great. Wherever he found vice he la&s;hed it, and frequent|ly, as Pope &s;ays, he<Q><L>Da&s;h'd the proud gam'&s;ter from his gilded car,</L>
<L>Bar'd the mean brea&s;t that lurk'd beneath a &s;tar.</L></Q></P>
<P>For &s;ome vigorous attacks again&s;t the mea&s;ures of a prevailing party, which Mr. De Foe reckoned uncon&s;titutional and unju&s;t, he was pro&s;ecuted, and received &s;entence to &s;tand on the pillory; which puni&s;hment he underwent.</P>
<P>At the very time he was in the hands of the mi|ni&s;try, to &s;hew the invincible force of his mind,
<PB N="319" REF="322">
he wrote a Hymn to the Pillory, as a kind of de|fiance of their power. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The reader (&s;ays he)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface to vol. ii.</NOTE> is de&s;ired to ob&s;erve this poem was the author's declaration, even when in the cruel hands of a mercile&s;s, as well as unju&s;t mini&s;try; that the treatment he had from them was unju&s;t, exor|bitant, and con&s;equently illegal.'</Q> As the mini|&s;try did not think proper to pro&s;ecute him for this fre&s;h in&s;ult again&s;t them, that forbearance was con&s;trued a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt in their former pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd volume of our author's works, is a piece entitled More Reformation, a &s;atire upon him&s;elf. We have already taken notice of a &s;a|tire of his called Reformation of Manners, in which &s;ome per&s;onal characters are &s;tigmatized, which drew much odium on Mr. De Foe. This &s;atire called More Reformation, is a kind of &s;upplement to the former. In the preface he complains of the &s;evere u&s;age he had met with, but, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that the world may di&s;cern that I am not one of tho&s;e who practi&s;e what they reprove, I began this &s;atire with owning in my&s;elf tho&s;e &s;ins and mis|fortunes which I am no more exempted from, than other men; and as I am far from pretend|ing to be free from human frailties, but forward|er to confe&s;s any of the errors of my life, than any man can be to accu&s;e me; I think my&s;elf in a better way to reformation, than tho&s;e who excu&s;e their own faults by reckoning up mine.'<P>'Some that have heard me complain of this hard u&s;age, have told me, there is &s;omething of a retaliation of providence in it, for my be|ing &s;o very free with the characters of other men in a late &s;atire called The Reformation of

Manners. To this I an&s;wer, fir&s;t, in that &s;atire, or any other I ever wrote, I have always care|fully avoided la&s;hing any man's private infirmi|ties, as being too &s;en&s;ible of my own, but if I have &s;ingled out any man by character, it has either been &s;uch, as intending to reform others, and execute the laws again&s;t vice, have been the greate&s;t examples, and encouragers of it in their own practice; or &s;uch as have been entru&s;ted with the executive power of ju&s;tice, and having been called upon by the laws to reform us, have been a public reproach to the magi&s;tracy of this nation, and ought to be puni&s;hed by the laws they have been protected by.'</P>
<P>'Secondly, I have never made any man's di&s;|a&s;ters, or misfortunes, the &s;ubject of my &s;atire. I never reproached any man for having his hou&s;e burnt, &s;hips ca&s;t away, or his family ruined. I never lampooned a man becau&s;e he could not pay his debts, or for his being a cuckold.'</P>
<P>'Thirdly, I never reproached any man for his opinion in religion, or e&s;teemed him the wor&s;e for differing in judgment from me.'</P>
<P>'If therefore the &s;candalous treatment I have re|ceived is ju&s;t on me, for abu&s;ing others, I mu&s;t a&s;k &s;uch, who is the man? Where is the cha|racter I have given that is not ju&s;t? and where is the retaliation of providence, that the&s;e men en|title them&s;elves to in loading me with fal&s;ities and lies, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for my &s;peaking truth.'</P>
<P>'But p&mdash;x on him, &s;aid a certain &s;ober gentle|man, he is a Whig, and what need he have med|dled with his own party, could not he have left them out, there were characters enough on the other &s;ide?'</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="324">
'Why really I mu&s;t own, I know no Whig or Tory in vice; the vicious and the virtuous are the only two parties I have to do with; if a vi|cious, lewd, debauched magi&s;trate happened to be a Whig, what then? let him mend his man|ners, and he may be a Whig &s;till, and if not, the re&s;t ought to be a&s;hamed of him.'</P></Q></P>
<P>We have been induced to make this extract, as it &s;eems to &s;hew the genius and &s;pirit of the author in a more advantageous light, than we could have otherwi&s;e done. Though he was a re&s;olute a&s;&s;ert|er of Whig principles, and a champion for the cau&s;e of liberty, yet was he never blinded by par|ty prejudice, but could di&s;cern de&s;igning, and &s;elf|i&s;h men, and &s;trip them of their di&s;gui&s;es, though joined with him in the &s;ame political conte&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the conclu&s;ion of the Hymn to the Pillory, which is written with great &s;trength of expre&s;&s;ion, he a&s;&s;igns the rea&s;ons for his being doomed to that ignominy.<Q><LG>

<P>There are in the &s;ame volume many other poe|tical pieces, and political, and polemical tracts, the greate&s;t part of which are written with great force of thought, though in an unpoli&s;hed irregu|lar &s;tile. The natural abilities of the author (for he was no &s;cholar) &s;eem to have been very high. He had a great knowledge of men and things, particularly what related to the government, and trade of the&s;e kingdoms. He wrote many pam|phlets on both, which were generally well receiv|ed, though his name was never prefixed. His imagination was fertile, &s;trong, and lively, as may be collected from his many works of fancy, par|ticularly his Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, which was written in &s;o natural a manner, and with &s;o many proba|ble incidents, that, for &s;ome time after its publi|cation, it was judged by mo&s;t people to be a true &s;tory. It was indeed written upon a model en|tirely new, and the &s;ucce&s;s and e&s;teem it met with, may be a&s;certained by the many editions it has &s;old, and the &s;ums of money which have been gained by it. Nor was he le&s;s remarkable in his writings of a &s;erious and religious turn, witne&s;s his Religious Court&s;hip, and his Family In&s;tructor; both of which &s;trongly inculcate the wor&s;hip of God, the relative duties of hu&s;bands,
<PB N="323" REF="326">
wives, parents, and children, not in a dry dogma|tic manner, but in a kind of dramatic way, which excites curio&s;ity, keeps the attention awake, and is extremely intere&s;ting, and pathetic.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een, that in his political capa|city he was a declared enemy to popery, and a bold defender of revolution principles. He was held in much e&s;teem by many great men, and though he never enjoyed any regular po&s;t under the government, yet he was frequently employed in matters of tru&s;t and confidence, particularly in Scotland, where he &s;everal times was &s;ent on af|fairs of great importance, e&s;pecially tho&s;e relative to the union of the kingdoms, of which he was one of the negotiators.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to arrive at the knowledge of half the tracts and pamphlets which were writ|ten by this laborious man, as his name is not pre|fixed, and many of them being temporary, have peri&s;hed like all other productions of that kind, when the &s;ubjects upon which they were written are forgot. His principal performances, perhaps, are the&s;e,<LIST>

What provocation De Foe had given to Pope we cannot determine, but he has not e&s;caped the la&s;h of that gentleman's pen. Mr. Pope in his &s;econd book of his Duciad thus &s;peaks of him;<Q><L>Earle&s;s on high &s;tood unaba&s;h'd De Foe,</L>

<P>It may be remarked that he has joined him with Tutchin, a man, whom judge Jeffries had or|dered to be &s;o inhumanly whipt through the market towns, that, as we have already ob&s;erved, he petitioned the King to be hanged. This &s;eve|rity &s;oured his temper, and after the depo&s;ition and death of King James, he indulged his re|&s;entment in in&s;ulting his memory. This may be the rea&s;on why Pope has &s;tigmatized him, and perhaps no better a one can be given for his attack|ing De Foe, whom the author of the Notes to the Dunciad owns to have been a man of parts. De Foe can never, with any propriety, be ranked a|mong&s;t the dunces; for whoever reads his works with candour and impartiality, mu&s;t be convinced that he was a man of the &s;tronge&s;t natural powers, a lively imagination, and &s;olid judgment, which, joined with an un&s;haken probity in his moral conduct, and an invincible integrity in his political &s;phere, ought not only to &s;creen him from the petulant attacks of &s;atire, but tran&s;mit his name with &s;ome degree of applau&s;e to po&s;terity.</P>

<P>THIS lady was born at Ilche&s;ter in So|merfet&s;hire September 11, 1674, being the elde&s;t of three daughters of Mr. Walter Singer, a gentleman of good family, and Mrs. Elizabeth Portnel, both per&s;ons of great worth and piety.

Mrs. Portnel, from a principle of tenderne&s;s, vi&s;ited tho&s;e who &s;uffered on that account, and by this accident an acquaintance commenced, which terminated in the nuptial uni|on.

Every one acquainted with her writings, and ca|pable of reli&s;hing the melifluent flow of her num|bers, will naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;he had a genius

for mu&s;ic, particularly that of a grave and &s;olemn kind, as it was be&s;t &s;uited to the grandeur of her &s;entiments, and the &s;ublimity of her devotion. But her mo&s;t prevailing propen&s;ion was to poetry. This &s;uperior grace was indeed the mo&s;t favourite employment of her youth, and in her the mo&s;t di|&s;tingui&s;hed excellence. So powerful was her geni|us in this way, that her pro&s;e hath all the charms, of ver&s;e without the fetters; the &s;ame fire and ele|vation; the &s;ame richne&s;s of imagery, bold figures, and flowing diction.</P>
<P>It appears by a life of Mrs. Rowe, prefixed to the fir&s;t volume of her mi&s;cellaneous works, that in the year 1696, the 22d of her age, a Collection of her Poems on various Occa&s;ions was publi&s;hed at the de&s;ire of two of her friends, which we &s;up|po&s;e did not contain all &s;he had by her, &s;ince the ingenious author of the preface, Mrs. Elizabeth John&s;on, gives the reader room to hope, that Mrs. Rowe might, in a little while, be prevailed upon to oblige the world with a &s;econd part, no way inferior to the former.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rowe's Paraphra&s;e on the 38th Chapter of Job was written at the reque&s;t of bi&s;hop Kenn, which gained her a great reputation. She had no other tutor for the French and Italian languages than the honourable Mr. Thynne, &s;on to the lord vi&s;count Weymouth, and father to the right honourable the counte&s;s of Hertford, who willing ly took the ta&s;k upon him&s;elf, and had the plea|&s;ure to &s;ee his fair &s;cholar improve &s;o fa&s;t by his le&s;&s;ons, that in a few months &s;he was able to read Ta&s;&s;o's Jeru&s;alem with ea&s;e. Her &s;hining merit, with the charms of her per&s;on and conver&s;ation, had procured her many admirers: among others, the celebrated Mr. Prior made his addre&s;&s;es to her; &s;o that allowing for the double licence of the po|et and the lover, the concluding lines in his An|&s;wer to Mrs. Singer's Pa&s;toral on Love and Friend|&s;hip,
<PB N="328" REF="331">
were not without foundation in truth; but Mr. Thomas Rowe, a very ingenious and learned gentleman, was the per&s;on de&s;tined to fill the arms of this amiable poete&s;s.</P>
<P>As this gentleman was a poet of no incon&s;ider|able rank, a man of learning and genius, we &s;hall here give &s;ome account of him, in place of a&s;&s;ign|ing him a particular Article, as the incidents of his life will be more naturally blended with that of his wife.&mdash;He was born at London, April the 25th, 1687, the elde&s;t &s;on of the revd. Mr. Rowe: who with a very accurate judg|ment, and a con&s;iderable &s;tock of u&s;eful learning, joined the talents in preaching and a mo&s;t lively and engaging manner in conver&s;ation. He was of a genteel de&s;cent, both on his father&punc;s and mother's &s;ide; but he thought too ju&s;tly to value him&s;elf on &s;uch extrin&s;ic circum&s;tances. His &s;uperior genius, and in&s;atiable thir&s;t after knowledge were con&s;picu|ous in his earlie&s;t years. He commenced his ac|quaintance with the Cla&s;&s;ics at Ep&s;om, while his father re&s;ided there, and by the &s;wift advances in this part of learning, quickly became the delight of his ma&s;ter, who treated him with very parti|cular indulgence, in &s;pight of the natural rugged|ne&s;s and &s;everity of his temper.</P>
<P>When his father removed to London, he accom|panied him, and was placed under the famous Dr. Walker, ma&s;ter of the Charter-Hou&s;e-School. His exerci&s;es here never failed of being di&s;tingui&s;hed even among tho&s;e who had the approbation of that excellent ma&s;ter, who would fain have per&s;uaded his father to place him at one of our Engli&s;h uni|ver&s;ities; but how honourably &s;oever Mr. Rowe might think of the learning of tho&s;e noble &s;eats of the Mu&s;es, yet not having the &s;ame advantageous no|tions of their political principles, he cho&s;e to enter him in a private academy in London, and &s;ome time be|fore his death &s;ent him to Leyden: Here he &s;tudied
<PB N="329" REF="332">
Jeuriel's Antiquities, civil law, the Belles Lettres, and experimental philo&s;ophy; and e&s;tabli&s;hed a re|putation for capacity, application, and an obliging deportment, both among the profe&s;&s;ors and &s;tudents. He returned from that celebrated &s;eat of literature, with a great acce&s;&s;ion of knowledge, entirely incor|rupt in his morals, which he had pre&s;erved as in|violate, as he could have done under the mo&s;t vigi|lant eye, though left without any re&s;traints but tho&s;e of his own virtue and prudence.</P>
<P>The love of liberty had always been one of Mr. Rowe's darling pa&s;&s;ions. He was very much con|firmed therein, by his familiar acquaintance with the hi&s;tory and noble authors of Greece and Rome, who&s;e very &s;pirit was tranferred into him: By re|&s;iding &s;o long at a Republic, he had continual ex|amples of the ine&s;timable value of freedom, as the parent of indu&s;try, and the univer&s;al &s;ource of &s;ocial happine&s;s. Tyranny of every kind he &s;incerely de|te&s;ted; but mo&s;t of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, deem|ing the &s;lavery of the mind the mo&s;t abject and ig|nominious, and in its con&s;equences more pernicious than any other.</P>
<P>He was a perfect ma&s;ter of the Greek, Latin and French languages; and, which is &s;eldom known to happen, had at once &s;uch a prodigious memory, and unexhau&s;tible fund of wit, as would have &s;ingly been admired, and much more united. The&s;e qua|lities, with an ea&s;y fluency of &s;peech, a frankne&s;s, and benevolence of di&s;po&s;ition, and a communica|tive temper, made his company much &s;ollicited by all who knew him. He animated the conver&s;ation, and in&s;tructed his companions by the acutene&s;s of his ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>He had formed a de&s;ign to compile the lives of all the illu&s;trious per&s;ons of antiquity, omitted by Plutarch; and for this purpo&s;e read the antient hi&s;|torians with great care. This de&s;ign he in part ex|ecuted. Eight lives were publi&s;hed &s;ince his de|cea&s;e,
<PB N="330" REF="333">
in octavo, by way of Supplement to that admired Biographer; in which though &s;o young a guide, he &s;trikes out a way like one well acquaint|ed with the dark and intricate paths of antiunity. The &s;tile is perfectly ea&s;y, yet conci&s;e, and nervous: The reflections ju&s;t, and &s;uch as might be expected from a lover of truth and of mankind.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Lives, he had fini&s;hed for the pre&s;s, the Life of Thra&s;ybulus, which being put into the hands of Sir Richard Steele, for his revi&s;al, was unhappily lo&s;t, and could never &s;ince be recovered.</P>
<P>The famous Mr. Dacier, having tran&s;lated Plu|tarch's Lives into French, with Remarks Hi&s;torical and Critical, the Abb&eacute; Bellenger added in 1734 a ninth tome to the other eight, con&s;i&s;ting of the Life of Hannibal, and Mr. Rowe's Lives made French by that learned Abb&eacute;: In the Preface to which ver&s;ion, he tran&s;cribes from the Preface to the Eng|li&s;h edition, the character of the author with vi&s;ible approbation; and ob&s;erves, that the Lives were written with ta&s;te; though being a po&s;thumous work, the author had not put his la&s;t hand to it.</P>
<P>Such is the character of Mr. Rowe, the hu&s;band of this amiable lady; and when &s;o accompli&s;hed a pair meet in conjugal bonds, what great expecta|tions may not be formed upon them! A friend of Mr. Rowe's upon that occa&s;ion wrote the following beautiful Epigram,<Q><L>No more proud Gallia, bid the world revere</L>
<L>Thy learned pair, Le Fevre and Dacier:</L>
<L>Britain may boa&s;t, this happy day unites,</L>
<L>Two nobler minds, in Hymen's &s;acred rites.</L>

Mr. Rowe being at Bath, in the year 1709, was introduced into the company of Mi&s;s Singer, wholived in a retirement not far from the city. The idea he had conceived of her from report and her writ|ings, charmed him; but when he had &s;een and con|ver&s;ed with her, he felt another kind of impre&s;&s;ion, and the e&s;teem of her accompli&s;hments was heighten|ed into the rapture of a lover. During the court|&s;hip, he wrote a poetical Epi&s;tle to a friend, who was a neighbour of Mrs. Singer, and acquainted with the family, in which were the following lines.<Q><L>Youth's livelie&s;t bloom, a never-fading grace,</L>

<P>He married her in the year 1710, and Mrs. Rowe's exalted merit, and amiable qualities, could not fail to in&s;pire the mo&s;t generous and la&s;ting pa&s;&s;ion. Mr. Rowe knew how to value that trea&s;ure of wit, &s;oftne&s;s and virtue, with which heaven had ble&s;&s;ed him; and made it his &s;tudy to repay the felicity with which &s;he crowned his life. The e&s;teem and tenderne&s;s he had for her is inex|pre&s;&s;ible, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;eems never to have abated the fondne&s;s and admiration of the lover; a circum|&s;tance which &s;eldom happens, but to tho&s;e who are

capable of enjoying mental intercour&s;e, and have a reli&s;h for the ideal tran&s;ports, as well as tho&s;e of a le&s;s elevated nature. It was &s;ome con&s;iderable time after his marriage, that he wrote to her a very ten|der Ode, under the name of Delia, full of the warme&s;t &s;entiments of connubial friend&s;hip and af|fection. The following lines in it may appear re|markable, as it plea&s;ed Heaven to di&s;po&s;e events, in a manner &s;o agreeable to the wi&s;hes expre&s;&s;ed in them,<Q><L>&mdash;So long may thy in&s;piring page,</L>

As Mr. Rowe had not a robu&s;t con&s;titution, &s;o an inten&s;e application to &s;tudy, beyond what the delicacy of his frame could bear, might contribute to that ill &s;tate of health which allayed the happi|ne&s;s of his married li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\ne, during the greater part of it.

<P>After Mr. Rowe's decea&s;e, and as &s;oon as her affairs would permit, our authore&s;s indulged her inconquerable inclination to &s;olitude, by retiring to Froome in Somer&s;et&s;hire, in the neighbourhood of which place the greate&s;t part of her e&s;tate lay. When &s;he for&s;ook the town, &s;he determined to re|turn no more but to &s;pend the remainder of her life in ab&s;olute retirement; yet upon &s;ome few oc|ca&s;ions &s;he thought it her duty to violate this re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="339">
In compliance with the importunate reque&s;t of the honourable Mrs. Thynne, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome months with her at London, after the death of her daughter the lady Brooke, and upon the decea&s;e of Mrs. Thynne her&s;elf, &s;he could not di&s;pute the commands of the counte&s;s of Hert|ford, who earne&s;tly de&s;ired her company, to &s;often the &s;evere affliction of the lo&s;s of &s;o excellent a mother, and once or twice more, the power which this lady had over Mrs. Rowe, drew her, with an obliging kind of violence, to &s;pend a few months with her in the country. Yet, even on the&s;e occa|&s;ions &s;he never quitted her retreat without &s;incere regret, and always returned to it, as &s;oon as &s;he could with decency di&s;engage her&s;elf from the im|portunity of her noble friends. It was in this rece&s;s that &s;he compo&s;ed the mo&s;t celebrated of her works, in twenty Letters from the Dead to the Living; the de&s;ign of which is to impre&s;s the notion of the &s;oul's immortality, without which all virtue and religion, with their temporal and eternal good con&s;equences mu&s;t fall to the ground.</P>
<P>Some who pretend to have no &s;cruples about the being of a God, have yet doubts about their own eternal exi&s;tence, though many authors have e&s;tabli&s;hed it, both by chri&s;tian and moral proofs, beyond rea&s;onable contradiction.

<P>In the year 1736, the importunity of &s;ome of Mrs. Rowe's acquaintance who had &s;een the Hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph in MS. prevailed on her to print it.

After this threat|ning illne&s;s &s;he recovered her u&s;ual good &s;tate of health; and though at the time of her decea&s;e &s;he was pretty far advanced in years, yet her exact temperance, and the calmne&s;s of her mind, undi&s;|turbed with unea&s;y cares, and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions, encouraged her friends to hope a much longer enjoy|ment of &s;o valuable a life, than it plea&s;ed heaven to allow them.

hearing &s;ome noi&s;e in her mi&s;tre&s;'s room, ran in|&s;tantly into it, and found her fallen off the chair on the floor, &s;peechle&s;s, and in the agonies of death. She had the immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon, but all the means u&s;ed were without &s;uc|ce&s;s, and having given one groan &s;he expired a few minutes before two o'clock, on Sunday morning, February the 20th, 1736-7: Her di&s;ea&s;e was judged to be an apoplexy. A pious book was found lying open by her, as al&s;o &s;ome loo&s;e papers, on which &s;he had written the following devout ejaculations,<Q><L>O guide, and council, and protect my &s;oul from &s;in!</L>
<L>O &s;peak! and let me know thy heav'nly will.</L>

<P>In her cabinet were found letters to &s;everal of her friends, which &s;he had ordered to be delivered to the per&s;ons to whom they were directed immediately after her decea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rowe lived in friend&s;hip with people of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion and di&s;tinction in life, by whom &s;he was e&s;teemed and re&s;pected. To enumerate them would be needle&s;s; let it &s;uffice to remark, that her life was honoured with the intimacy, and her death la|mented with the tears, of the counte&s;s of Hertford. Many ver&s;es were publi&s;hed to celebrate her memory, among&s;t which a copy written by Mrs. Elizabeth Carter are the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus lived honoured, and died lamented, this excellent poete&s;s, who&s;e beauty, though not her

highe&s;t excellence, yet greatly contributed to &s;et off her other more important graces to advantage; and who&s;e piety will ever &s;hine as a bright example to po&s;terity, and teach them how to heighten the natural gifts of under&s;tanding, by true and unaffected devo|tion.&mdash;The conduct and behaviour of Mrs. Rowe might put &s;ome of the pre&s;ent race of females to the blu&s;h, who rake the town for infamous adventures to amu&s;e the public. Their works will &s;oon be for|gotten, and their memories when dead, will not be deemed exceeding precious; but the works of Mrs. Rowe can never peri&s;h, while exalted piety and genuine goodne&s;s have any exi&s;tence in the world. Her memory will be ever honoured, and her name dear to late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rowe's Mi&s;cellaneous Works were publi&s;hed a few years ago at London, in octavo, and her De|votions were revi&s;ed and publi&s;hed by the reverend Dr. Watts, under the title of Devout Exerci&s;es, to which that worthy man wrote a preface; and while he removes &s;ome cavils that wantonne&s;s and &s;en&s;u|ality might make to the &s;tile and manner of the&s;e Devotions, he &s;hews that they contain the mo&s;t &s;ub|lime &s;entiments, the mo&s;t refined breathings of the &s;oul, and the mo&s;t elevated and coele&s;tial piety.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rowe's acquaintance with per&s;ons of fa&s;hion had taught her all the accompli&s;hments of good-breeding, and elegance of behaviour, and with|out formality or affectation &s;he practi&s;ed in the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;olitude, all the addre&s;s and politene&s;s of a court.</P>
<P>She had the happie&s;t command over her pa&s;&s;ions, and maintained a con&s;tant calmne&s;s of temper, and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, that could not be ruffled by adver&s;e accidents.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="344">
She was in the utmo&s;t degree an enemy to ill-na|tured &s;atire and detraction; &s;he was as much un|acquainted with envy, as if it had been impo&s;&s;ible for &s;o ba&s;e a pa&s;&s;ion to enter into the human mind.</P>
<P>She had few equals in conver&s;ation; her wit was lively, and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her thoughts in the mo&s;t beautiful and flowing eloquence.</P>
<P>When &s;he entered into the married &s;tate, the high|e&s;t e&s;teem and mo&s;t tender affection appeared in her conduct to Mr. Rowe, and by the mo&s;t gentle and obliging manner, and the exerci&s;e of every &s;ocial and good natured virtue; &s;he confirmed the empire &s;he had gained over his heart. In &s;hort, if the mo&s;t cultivated under&s;tanding, if an imagination lively and exten&s;ive, a character perfectly moral, and a &s;oul formed for the mo&s;t exalted exerci&s;es of de|votion, can render a per&s;on amiable, Mrs. Rowe has a ju&s;t claim to that epithet, as well as to the admi|ration of the lovers of poetry and elegant compo|&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>The Revd. Dr. THOMAS YALDEN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman was born in the city of Exeter, and the younge&s;t of &s;ix &s;ons of Mr. John Yalden of Su&s;&s;ex. He received his education at a Grammar-&s;chool, belonging to Magdalen-Col|lege in Oxford. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jacob.</NOTE> In the year 1690 he was ad|mitted a commoner of Magdalen-Hall, under Mr. John Pullen, who was e&s;teemed an excellent tutor, and a very great ma&s;ter of logic, and the following year he was cho&s;en &s;cholar of Magdalen-College. Here he became a fellow-pupil with the celebrated Mr. Addi&s;on and Dr. Henry Sacheverel, and early contracted a particular friend&s;hip with tho&s;e two gentlemen. This academical affection Mr. Addi&s;on pre&s;erved not only abroad in his travels, but al&s;o on his advancement to con&s;iderable employments at home, and kept the &s;ame ea&s;y and free corre&s;pon|dence to the very la&s;t, as when their fortunes were more on a level. This pre&s;ervation of affection is rendered more &s;ingular, by Mr. Yalden's having e&s;pou&s;ed a very oppo&s;ite Intere&s;t to that of Mr. Ad|di&s;on, for he adhered to the High-Church party, and was &s;u&s;pected of an attachment to an exiled family, for which he afterwards was brought into very great trouble.</P>
<P>In the year 1700 he was admitted actual and per|petual fellow of Magdalen-College, and qualified
<PB N="343" REF="346">
him&s;elf the next year, by taking orders, as the founder's &s;tatutes require. After his admi&s;&s;ion he received two public marks of favour from that &s;o|ciety: The fir&s;t was a pre&s;entation to a living in Warwick&s;hire, con&s;i&s;tent with his fellow&s;hip; and the other, his being elected moral philo&s;ophy-reader, an office for life, endowed with a hand&s;ome &s;tipend, and peculiar privileges.</P>
<P>In 1706 he was received into the family of his noble and kind patron the duke of Beaufort; with whom he was in very great favour, having in many in&s;tances experienced his bounty and genero&s;ity. In the following year he compleated his academical degrees, by commencing doctor in divinity: He pre|&s;ented to the &s;ociety their founder's picture in full length, which now hangs up in the public-hall; and afterwards he delivered in to the pre&s;ident a voluntary re&s;ignation of his fellow&s;hip, and moral philo&s;ophy-lecture. He was afterwards preferred to be rector of Chalten in Cleanville, two adjoining towns and rectories in Hamp&s;hire. He was elected by the pre&s;ident and governors of Bridewell, preacher of that ho&s;pital, upon the re&s;ignation of Dr. Atter|bury, afterwards lord bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Having mentioned this prelate, it will be proper here to ob&s;erve, that upon a &s;u&s;picion of Dr. Yalden's being concerned with him, in a plot to re&s;tore the exiled family; and for which the bi&s;hop was afterwards bani&s;hed, he was &s;eized upon by authority, and committed to pri&s;on. When he was examined before the council, concerning hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\n corre&s;pondence and intimacy with Mr. Kelley the bi&s;hop's &s;ecretary; he did not deny his knowledge of, and corre&s;pondence with, him, but &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;&s;erting, that no mea&s;ures contrary to the con&s;ti|tution were ever canva&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="347">
There was found in his pocket book, a copy of ver&s;es reflecting on the reigning family, and which might well bear the con&s;truction of a libel; but when he was charged with them, he denied that he ever compo&s;ed &s;uch ver&s;es, or that the hand-writing was his own, and a&s;&s;erted his innocence in every circum&s;tance relating to the plot. The ver&s;es in all probability were put into his pocket-book, by the &s;ame per&s;on, who with &s;o much dexterity placed a trea&s;onable paper in bi&s;hop Atterbury's clo&s;e-&s;tool, and then pretending to be the di&s;coverer of it, pre|ferred it again&s;t his lord&s;hip, as an evidence of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">\n di&s;affection. The particulars of that memorable tryal are recorded in the Life of Atterbury, writ|ten by the authors of Biographia Britannica.&mdash;The heats rai&s;ed by Atterbury's tryal &s;ub&s;iding, tho&s;e who were &s;u&s;pected of being concerned with him, as no evidence appeared &s;trong enough to convict them, were relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Dr. Yalden was &s;till favoured with the patronage of the generous duke of Beaufort, and his re&s;idence in that noble family recommended him to the ac|quaintance of many of the fir&s;t quality and cha|racter in the kingdom, and as he was of a chear|ful temper, and of a plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive con|ver&s;ation, he retained their friend&s;hip and e&s;teem till his death, which happened the 16th of July, 1736, in the 66th year of his age.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. JOSEPH MITCHEL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was the &s;on of a Stone|cutter in Scotland, and was born about the year 1684. He received an univer&s;ity education while he remained in that kingdom, and having &s;ome views of improving his fortune, repaired to the metropolis. We are not able to recover ma|ny particulars concerning this poet, who was ne|ver &s;ufficiently eminent to excite much curio&s;ity concerning him. By a di&s;&s;ipated imprudent beha|viour he rendered tho&s;e, who were more inti|mately acquainted with him, le&s;s &s;ollicitous to pre&s;erve the circum&s;tances of his life, which were &s;o little to his advantage. We find him enjoy|ing the favour of the earl of Stair, and Sir Robert Walpole, to whom he addre&s;&s;es &s;ome of his poems. He received &s;o many obligations from the latter, and was &s;o warm in his intere&s;t, that he obtained the epithet of Sir Robert Walpole's Poet, and for a great part of his life had an en|tire dependence on the bounty of that munificent &s;tate&s;man. Mr. Mitchel, who was a &s;lave to his plea&s;ures, and governed by every gu&s;t of irregular appetite, had many opportunities of experiencing the dangerous folly of extravagance, and the ma|ny unea&s;y moments which it occa&s;ions. Notwith|&s;tanding this, his conduct was never corrected, e|ven when the means of doing it were in his pow|er. At a time when Mr. Mitchel laboured under &s;evere nece&s;&s;ities, by the death of his wife's un|cle &s;everal thou&s;and pounds devolved to him,
<PB N="348" REF="351">
of which he had no &s;ooner got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, than he planned &s;chemes of &s;pending it, in place of di&s;|charging the many debts he had contracted. This behaviour, as it conveyed to his creditors no high idea of his hone&s;ty, &s;o it obliged him to be per|petually &s;kulking, and mu&s;t con&s;equently have em|bittered even tho&s;e, hours which he fal&s;ly dedi|dicated to plea&s;ure; for they who live under a perpetual dread of lo&s;ing their liberty, can en|joy no great comfort even in their mo&s;t carele&s;s moments.</P>
<P>Of the many poems which Mr. Mitchel wrote, but few &s;ucceeded to any degree, nor indeed much de&s;erved it. At a time when the politicians were engaged in &s;ettling the Land-Tax, and various o|pinions were offered concerning the ability of that branch of the commonwealth, &s;o that a proper medium or &s;tandard might be fixed; he ver&s;ified the Totne&s;s Addre&s;s, much about the time of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; in which it is humourou&s;ly propo&s;ed, that the land|ed intere&s;t &s;hould pay twenty &s;hillings in the pound. This poem having a reference to a fa&s;hion|able topic of conver&s;ation, was better received than mo&s;t of his other pieces.</P>
<P>There was likewi&s;e a poem of Mr. Mitchel's, called The Shoe-heel, which was much read on account of the low humour it contains. He has addre&s;&s;ed to Dr. Watts a poem on the &s;ubject of Jonah in the Whale's Belly. In the dedication he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That it was written for the advance|ment of true virtue and reformation of manners; to rai&s;e an emulation among&s;t our young poets to attempt divine compo&s;ures, and help to wipe off the cen&s;ures which the numerous labours of the mu&s;es are ju&s;tly charged with. If (&s;ays he)

it &s;hall &s;erve any of the&s;e purpo&s;es, I &s;hall be &s;atisfied, though I gain no reputation by it a|mong tho&s;e who read a new poem with no o|ther view, than to pa&s;s a judgment on the abi|lities of the author.'</Q> When the antagoni&s;ts of Pope were threatened with the publication of the Dunciad, Mr. Mitchel had &s;ome &s;u&s;picion that he him&s;elf was to be &s;tigmatized in it: con&s;cious that he had never offended Mr. Pope, he took an op|portunity to write to him upon that &s;ubject. He informed him, that he had been an admirer of his writings; that he declined all connexion with tho&s;e men, who combined to reduce his reputati|on, and that when no offence was given, no re|&s;entment &s;hould be di&s;covered. Mr. Pope, upon receiving this letter from Mitchel, prote&s;ting his innocence as to any calumny publi&s;hed again&s;t him, was &s;o equitable as to &s;trike him out of his Danciad, in which, by mi&s;repre&s;entation he had a&s;&s;igned him a place.</P>
<P>Mr. Mitchel lived in good corre&s;pondence with many of the mo&s;t eminent wits of the time, and was particularly honoured with the friend&s;hip of Aaron Hill, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> a gentleman of &s;o amiable a di&s;po&s;ition, that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">\never cultivated an intimacy with him, was &s;ure to be a gainer. Once, when Mr. Mitchel was in di&s;tre&s;s, Mr. Hill, who could not perhaps conveniently relieve him by pe|cuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, gave him a higher in&s;tance of friend&s;hip, than could be &s;hewn by money. He wrote a beautiful dramatic piece in two acts, call|ed The Fatal Extravagant, in which he expo&s;ed the hideous vice of gaming. This little dramatic work is planned with &s;uch exqui&s;ite art, wrought up with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, and the &s;cenes are &s;o natural, intere&s;ting and moving, that I know not if Mr. Hill has any where touched the pa&s;&s;i|ons with &s;o great a ma&s;tery.

As this was a favour never to be forgot|ten, &s;o we find Mr. Mitchel taking every proper occa&s;ion to expre&s;s his gratitude, and celebrate his patron. Among&s;t the fir&s;t of his poems, is An Ode, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Hill, which is one of the be&s;t of his compo&s;itions. The two la&s;t &s;tanza's are as follow,<Q><LG>

<P>He &s;till retained, however, an inclination to eru|dition, contrary to what might have been expect|ed, and by much conver&s;ation with travellers from abroad, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of mo&s;t of the liv|ing languages, e&s;pecially the French, Italian, and Spani&s;h, from all which, as well as from the La|tin and Greek, he has favoured the world with a

<ITEM>1. Britannicus and Alexander the Great. Two Tragedies from Racine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Litigant, a Comedy of 3 Acts; tran&s;lat|ed from the French of M. Racine, who took it from the Wa&s;ps of Ari&s;tophanes, 8vo. 1715. Scene in a city of Lower Nornandy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Manlius Capitolinus, a Tragedy from the French of M. La Fo&s;&s;e, 1715. When the earl of Portland was amba&s;&s;ador at the French court, this play was acted at Paris three&s;core nights running; the &s;ubject is related by Livy. This French au|thor &s;tudied &s;ome time at Oxford, and, upon his return home, applied him&s;elf to dramatic poetry, in which he acquired great reputation. He died a|bout the year 1713.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Cid, a Tragedy from Corneille.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Cato of Utica, a Tragedy from M. Des Champs; acted at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields 1716, dedicated to Count Volkra his Ex|cellency the Imperial Amba&s;&s;ador: to which is added a Parallel between this Play and Mr. Ad|di&s;on's Cato.</ITEM>

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, Mr. Ozell has tran&s;lated all Mo|liere's plays, which are printed in 6 vol. 12mo. and likewi&s;e a collection of &s;ome of the be&s;t Spani&s;h and Italian plays, from Calderon, Aretin, Ricci, and Lopez de Vega. Whether any of the&s;e plays, tran&s;lated from the Spani&s;h, were ever printed, we cannot be po&s;itive. Mr. Ozell's tran&s;lation of Moliere is far from being excel|lent, for Moliere was an author to whom none, but a genius like him&s;elf, could well do ju&s;tice.</P>

His other works are<LIST>
<ITEM>The Hi&s;tory of Don Quixote, tran&s;lated by &s;e|veral hands, publi&s;hed by Peter Motteux; revi&s;ed and compared with the be&s;t edition, printed at Ma|drid, by Mr. Ozell, 5th edition, 1725.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Reflexions on Learning, by M. de Fenelon, Archbi&s;hop of Cambray, made Engli&s;h from the Paris Edition 12mo. 1718.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Common Prayer, not Common Sen&s;e, in &s;everal Places of the Portugueze, Spani&s;h, Italian, French, Latin, and Greek Tran&s;lations of the Engli&s;h Li|turgy; Being a Specimen of the Manifold Omi&s;|&s;ions, &amp;c. in all, or mo&s;t of the &s;aid Tran&s;lations, &s;ome of which were printed at Oxford, and the re&s;t at Cambridge, or London, 1722.</ITEM>

<ITEM>Logic, or the Art of Thinking; from the French of M. Nicole, 1723.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Mr. Ozell fini&s;hed a Tran&s;lation from the Por|tugueze, begun by Dr. Geddes, of the mo&s;t ce|lebrated, popi&s;h, eccle&s;ia&s;tical Romance; being the the Life of Veronica of Milan, a book certified by the heads of the univer&s;ity of Conimbra in Por|tugal, to be revi&s;ed by the Angels, and approved of by God.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the works of Mr. Ozell, who, if he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s any genius, has not yet lived in vain, for he has rendered into Engli&s;h &s;ome very u&s;eful pieces, and if his tran&s;lations are not ele|gant; they are generally pretty ju&s;t, and true to their original.</P>
<P>Mr. Ozell is &s;everely touched by Mr. Pope in the fir&s;t book of the Dunciad, on what account we cannot determine; perhaps that &s;atyri&s;t has only in|troduced him to grace the train of his Dunces.

Ozell was incen&s;ed to the la&s;t degree by this u&s;age, and in a paper called The Weekly Med|ley, September 1729, he publi&s;hed the following &s;trange Adverti&s;ement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on the Dunciad.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'As to my learning, this envious wretch-knew, and every body knows, that the whole bench of bi&s;hops, not long ago, were plea&s;ed to give me a pur&s;e of guineas for di&s;|covering the erroneous tran&s;lations of the Common Prayer in Portugueze, Spani&s;h, French, Italian, &amp;c. As for my genius, let Mr. Cleland &s;hew better ver&s;es in all Pope's works, than Ozell's ver&s;ion of Boileau's Lutrin, which the late lord Hallifax was &s;o well plea&s;ed with, that he com|plimented him with leave to dedicate it to him, &amp;c. &amp;c. Let him &s;hew better and truer poetry in The Rape of the Lock, than in Ozell's Rape of the Bucket, which, becau&s;e an ingenious au|thor happened to mention in the &s;ame breath with Pope's, viz.<Q>' Let Ozell &s;ing the Bucket, Pope the Lock,</Q>'the little gentleman had like to have run mad; and Mr. Toland and Mr. Gildon publicly declared Ozell's Tran&s;lation of Homer to be, as it was prior, &s;o likewi&s;e &s;uperior, to Pope's.&mdash;Surely, &s;urely, every man is free to de&s;erve well of his country!'

<P>This author died about the middle of October 1743, and was buried in a vault of a church be|longing to St. Mary Aldermanbury. He never ex|perienced any of the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, which have been &s;o frequently the portion of his in&s;pired brethren, for a per&s;on born in the &s;ame county with him, and who owed particular obligations to his family, left him a competent provi&s;ion: be|&s;ides, he had always enjoyed good places. He

was for &s;ome years auditor-general of the city and Bridge accounts, and, to the time of his decea&s;e, auditor of the accounts of St. Paul's Cathedral, and St. Thomas's Ho&s;pital. Though, in reality, Ozell was a man of very little genius, yet Mr. Coxeter a&s;&s;erts, that his conver&s;ation was &s;urpriz|ingly plea&s;ing, and that he had a pretty good knowledge of men and things. He po&s;&s;ibly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;hare of good nature, which, when joined with but a tolerable under&s;tanding, will render the per&s;on, who is ble&s;&s;ed with it, more amiable, than the mo&s;t fla&s;hy wit, and the highe&s;t genius without it.</P>
