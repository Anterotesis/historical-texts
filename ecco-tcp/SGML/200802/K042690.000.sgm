<P>It was thought de&s;irable by &s;ome per&s;ons, who have the Cau&s;e of the Negroes &s;eriou&s;ly at heart, that the&s;e proceedings &s;hould be &s;peedily publi&s;hed. They have, therefore, been collected ha&s;tily, in the mid&s;t of many pre&s;&s;ing avocations. The &s;ub&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed is carefully pre&s;erved. The form, if that were of any moment, may be mended hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>HOUSE OF COMMONS. <DATE><HI>Monday, April</HI> 18, 1791.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>IN a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e,</P>
<P>Mr. WILBERFORCE moved, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Chair|man be in&s;tructed to move for leave to bring in a bill to prevent the farther Importation of Slaves into theBriti&s;h Colonies in the We&s;t Indies."</Q></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this debate,</P>
<P>Mr. FRANCIS &s;aid, he &s;hould have contented him|&s;elf with giving his vote for the motion, but for &s;ome con&s;iderations, which were per&s;onal to him, and by which he thought him&s;elf particularly called upon to deliver his opinion on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, not impli|citly by a vote, but expre&s;&s;ly by declaration. He be|lieved he was not very likely to be &s;u&s;pected of receiv|ing, with &s;pecial favour and partiality, any mea&s;ure in|troduced
<PB N="2" REF="4">
and recommended from the other &s;ide of the Hou&s;e; that, in his own &s;ituation in private life, every motive, by which the conduct of men is u&s;ually deter|mined, was united on one &s;ide, and powerfully pre&s;&s;ed upon him, to engage him to take part this night again&s;t his opinion. Connections of every &s;ort; friends, who were dear to him, and who thought their fortunes were at &s;take; &s;olicitations, the mo&s;t urgent, from per&s;ons to whom he was bound by many ties; and po&s;&s;ibly the pro&s;pect of advantage to him&s;elf or to his family, at a future day, to be forfeited or pre&s;erved. All the&s;e were in one &s;cale, and nothing in the other, but the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e, and the protection of creatures, who would never know that he had endeavoured to &s;erve them, or who&s;e gratitude could never reach him. That he did not &s;tate the&s;e circum&s;tances for o&s;tentation, or as a claim to merit, but to fortify his cau&s;e, by &s;hew|ing that his opinion was &s;incere. Sir, I do not intend to go far into the general &s;ubject. If the undi&s;puted &s;tate of facts, if the clear and able argument delivered by the honourable gentleman, who takes the lead in this bu&s;ine&s;s, has not carried conviction along with it, I mu&s;t conclude, that truth and rea&s;on on this &s;ubject have no acce&s;s to the human mind. Many gentlemen, in|deed, have a&s;&s;erted what they have by no means e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and what, upon the whole, I utterly di&s;believe, that this trade is <HI>profitable</HI>; but no man has yet had the courage to affirm, or even to in&s;inuate that it is not <HI>criminal.</HI> The que&s;tion then is not, whether the trade be criminal, but in what degree? Is it a crime of the highe&s;t guilt in morals, or is it in practice capable of palliation? Will it admit of an excu&s;e? No, Sir; I de|clare upon my honour and my con&s;cience, none. I
<PB N="3" REF="5">
pa&s;s by the traffic as it is conducted on the coa&s;t of Africa, the temptation you give to one human creature to make a property of another, and to &s;ell him to per|petual &s;lavery. I take no notice of the mi&s;eries it pro|duces in that country. Remember only that, whatever they are, you are an&s;werable for them all. You create the market, and it is the market that con&s;titutes the de|mand, and produces the &s;upply. I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on the horrors of the Middle Pa&s;&s;age. You do well to pa&s;s over them with di&s;regard. The mo&s;t determined mind, the mo&s;t obdurate heart, if it be human, could not li&s;ten to the evidence, on that &s;ubject, without torture. I take the&s;e creatures in that, which is &s;tated to be their be&s;t &s;ituation; at their landing in the i&s;lands; at their arrival in the land of promi&s;e, where they are in&s;tantly to find relief from their &s;ufferings; where, in return for a moderate degree of labour, a tolerable mode of exi&s;|tence is provided for them. You &s;ay you have paid for them; that they &s;ub&s;i&s;t at your expence, and that you have a right to their labour. Be it &s;o. On that princi|ple, let us &s;ee how they are treated. In con&s;idering the &s;tate of &s;lavery in the We&s;t Indies, the object, that in&s;tantly &s;trikes my mind with a force and conviction, to which the evidence of &s;pecial facts hardly makes an addition, is the power of corporal puni&s;hment, allotted as I find it. I do not a&s;k you to inquire in what man|ner this power is exerci&s;ed, but how it is di&s;po&s;ed of, and to whom it is tru&s;ted, and then to determine what mu&s;t be the effect of it. They know nothing of the human con&s;titution, who have not ob&s;erved, that power of every &s;ort, of one man over another, has a natural tendency to deprave and corrupt the mind. The moment I hear of &s;uch power, uncontrouled, in any hand, I con|clude
<PB N="4" REF="6">
that the depravity is unlimited. The actual exer|ci&s;e of it, in the infliction of puni&s;hment, a&s;&s;uredly intro|duces that wor&s;t and mo&s;t odious of all di&s;orders in the moral &s;y&s;tem, per&s;onal cruelty. The truth of the&s;e principles is acknowledged by the &s;pirit and caution of our penal laws in every other in&s;tance, by the care they take, in all criminal proceedings, to &s;eparate the intere&s;t from the judgment, and the judgment from the execu|tion. They will not &s;uffer &s;uch characters and powers to be united in one per&s;on; nor are they united in any civilized &s;ociety upon earth, except in our We&s;t India i&s;lands. What are the u&s;ual offences imputed to ne|groes? In ninety-nine in&s;tances out of a hundred, they are either idlene&s;s or theft. They do not work hard enough to &s;atisfy the ta&s;k-ma&s;ter, (and why they &s;hould work at all, I know not) or they &s;teal provi&s;ions. The thing they can eat is the only thing worth their &s;tealing. Food is the only object of theft, which it is in their power to conceal, or that could po&s;&s;ibly do them any &s;ervice. Con&s;ider the ri&s;k they run, the horrible pu|ni&s;hments they &s;uffer when detected, and then you may conceive in what manner they are fed. But, in the con&s;ideration of the&s;e offences, who is the offended party?&mdash;The negro driver.&mdash;Who is the judge of the fact? The driver.&mdash;Who awards the puni&s;hment? The driver.&mdash;Who inflicts it? The driver with his own hand. But how? Captain Giles, of the army, &s;ays, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the puni&s;hment by whipping, though with fewer la&s;hes given, is more &s;evere and cruel than that of the army, becau&s;e of the &s;ize of the whip."</Q> Captain Hall, of the navy, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that in Barbadoes and the Leeward I&s;lands, the treatment of the negroes on the plantations was inhuman; that the puni&s;hments in|flicted
<PB N="5" REF="7">
were very &s;hocking to per&s;ons not u&s;ed to &s;ee them; much more &s;o, than on board a man of war. The field &s;laves he has &s;een, (a great many) were ge|nerally marked with the whip."</Q> This is the <HI>mode</HI> of puni&s;hment. What is likely to be the degree of it? An angry man determines the penalty; an offended judge inflicts it; and he, perhaps, by office, by habit, and oc|cupation, one of the lowe&s;t if not wor&s;t of our &s;pecies. If you cannot have an indifferent judge of the offences of the&s;e wretches, at lea&s;t let there be a cold, indiffe|rent executioner. It is a horrible truth that, when once the la&s;h is lifted by an angry man, with de&s;potic power over the object, his rage is inflamed by every &s;troke he gives. The cries and writhings of the creature are called re&s;i&s;tance; even his patience is called &s;ulkine&s;s; even his &s;ufferings are an offence. The decrees of pa&s;|&s;ion are executed by pa&s;&s;ion. Admitting the power to be nece&s;&s;ary, is there any protection again&s;t the abu&s;e of it? Have the negroes any &s;helter? Have they any appeal? Is there a law to deter, is there a magi&s;trate to re&s;ort to?&mdash;No, Sir; none at all. Mr. Terry, who was many years an over&s;eer in Grenada, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he has known &s;laves puni&s;hed by managers &s;everely for trifling faults; that they dur&s;t not complain to the owner, for fear of wor&s;e treatment; that he has known them puni&s;hed by the owner for &s;o doing, and &s;ent back, though their complaint was ju&s;t; that field &s;laves u&s;ually bear the marks of the whip; and that he never heard that a &s;lave complained to a magi&s;trate of his owner, manager, over&s;eer, or attorney; that he has known the <HI>&s;ame</HI> per&s;on both attorney, mana|ger, and doctor on one e&s;tate; that he never knew a planter or manager interfere with another's treat|ment
<PB N="6" REF="8">
of his &s;laves; that food is the general object of theft among &s;laves, and at the hazard of their lives. That an over&s;eer on the e&s;tate where he was, (Mr. Coghlan) threw a &s;lave into the boiling cane juice, who died in four days; he was not puni&s;hed other|wi&s;e than by replacing the &s;lave, and being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ervice; was told of this by the owner's &s;on, the carpenter, and many &s;laves on the e&s;tate; has heard it often."</Q></P>
<P>Again&s;t all the allegations and all the arguments on this &s;ubject, one general an&s;wer is u&s;ually &s;tated, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be conclu&s;ive: <HI>The negroes are our property; we have paid high prices for them, our profits depend upon the care we take of them. If we are bad men, at lea&s;t we under&s;tand our intere&s;t too well, to de&s;troy or di&s;able the in|&s;truments, by which alone our e&s;tates are made of any value to us.</HI> In the fir&s;t place, Sir, the proprietor is not in general the per&s;on, who exerci&s;es the power in que&s;|tion. If he were, it might be fair to pre&s;ume, that the con&s;ideration of his true intere&s;t would be &s;ome re&s;traint upon his pa&s;&s;ions. I fear, that, in general, it would not be effective. Many of the We&s;t-India proprietors, I know, are men of as much honour and humanity as are to be found in any other rank of life; but they re|&s;ide in England. Concerning the management of their e&s;tates, they have no other evidence but the information of their over&s;eers; concerning the treatment of their &s;laves, they have nothing to judge by, but the amount produce of their labour. If the returns are abundant, it is not likely that the owners &s;hould be much di&s;po&s;ed to inquire into abu&s;es, by which their profits do not appear to be dimini&s;hed. They hear no complaints;
<PB N="7" REF="9">
they live happily them&s;elves, and conclude that all is well.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Hall &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he believes the &s;laves &s;uffered from the owner's ab&s;ence, becau&s;e it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the over&s;eer, for his own credit, to make as much &s;ugar as po&s;&s;ible; to do this, he mu&s;t work &s;laves to the utmo&s;t; it being no concern of his whether they died or not."</Q></NOTE> But I deny that the principle, &s;o a&s;&s;umed and relied on, namely, that &s;laves will be well treated, be|cau&s;e it is the intere&s;t of an owner to take care of his property, is conclu&s;ive in this ca&s;e, as it would be in the ca&s;e of inanimate property. All the protection, which you can expect from the principle, and it goes no farther, is, that corporal puni&s;hment &s;hall not be inflicted to the hazard of life and limb; that the &s;lave &s;hall not be di&s;abled from performing the ta&s;k allotted to him. Within that limitation, the la&s;h may be in|flicted with the mo&s;t &s;hocking, capricious &s;everity, provided it does not e&s;&s;entially injure the property of the owner. But to &s;ecure even that degree of pro|tection, he ought never to tru&s;t the la&s;h out of his own hand. He delegates his power to another, but not the intere&s;t, which, you &s;ay, is to govern the ex|erci&s;e of it. Still the negroes are your property. So are your hor&s;es, and of more value too, if price and value are the &s;ame. See how tho&s;e noble, u&s;eful ani|mals are treated by coachmen and others, every day in the &s;treets; every night at the doors of the crowded a&s;&s;emblies of this town, before the eyes of their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and even at the hazard of their lives. I have been often witne&s;s to the&s;e abominable &s;cenes of riotous or pa&s;&s;ionate cruelty. Did you ever hear of a coachman puni&s;hed, or even di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, for cruel treat|ment of his hor&s;es?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">One would think, at the fir&s;t view of the &s;ubject, that a plantation, once properly &s;tocked with male and female negroes, would &s;upply it&s;elf without farther im|portation. I wi&s;h it were &s;o; for then I &s;hould con|clude that the condition of the negroes was tolerable at lea&s;t. There is nothing in the climate or &s;oil to coun|teract the propagation of negroes in the i&s;lands, any more than in Africa, where they multiply to exce&s;s. In all other countries, the labouring part of the people are in general the mo&s;t prolific. Why not in the We&s;t Indies? Exce&s;&s;ive labour, and &s;canty unwhol&s;ome food, would be &s;ufficient to check population any where. But the fact is, that the planters do not think it their intere&s;t to encourage it. Captain Hall tells you, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, breeding is not thought de&s;ira|ble; they rather thought it a misfortune to have pregnant women, or even young &s;laves. They e&s;teemed the charge of rearing a child to maturity, more trouble&s;ome and greater than buying a &s;lave fit for work; and it was not uncommon for them to give away a child of two years old, as you would a a puppy from a litter. Has heard an over&s;eer of &s;ome con&s;equence expre&s;s this opinion. It was, in fact, his &s;y&s;tem to prevent population, as far as in his power; and he under&s;tood this to be a general &s;y&s;tem. So little care was taken of infants, that mothers deemed it a misfortune to have children: after the month, they were &s;ent to field labour, with their child upon their backs, and &s;o little time afforded them to attend to its wants, that he has &s;een a woman, &s;eated to give &s;uck to her child, rou&s;ed from that &s;ituation by a &s;evere blow from the cart whip."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">Mr. Terry &s;ays that, while a manager, he never <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"received any direction about attention to preg|nant women, or children; has heard managers &s;ay, it was cheaper to buy African &s;laves than to breed; that they wi&s;hed the children to die, for they lo&s;t much of the mother's work during their infancy."</Q></P>
<P>Captain Ro&s;s &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he has &s;een a negro woman flogged with ebony bu&s;hes, &s;o that the &s;kin of her back was taken off down to her heels; &s;he was then turned round, and flogged from her brea&s;t down to her wai&s;t; and in con&s;equence, he &s;aw her afterwards walking upon all four, and unable to get up."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the treatment of women &s;laves, and in that &s;tate too, which of all others would excite pity in the mo&s;t callous heart, that &s;till had one human &s;en&s;ation left in it. But we are told that, altho' po&s;&s;ibly facts of this atrocious nature may have happened in the early periods of the We&s;t-India &s;ettlements, no &s;uch in&s;tances occur at pre&s;ent: that the government of the i&s;lands in this re&s;pect is greatly improved; that good laws have been made; that they are carefully executed; and that, upon the whole, the &s;ituation of the negroes is con&s;ide|rably mended, and grows every day more and more tolerable. Perhaps it may be &s;o on &s;ome particular plantations; but, in general, I do not believe the a&s;|&s;ertion to be true. The operation of habits and prin|ciples is permanent and uniform; the check created by good laws can only be temporary and occa&s;ional, until they have acted long enough to effect a change in the manners of the people. It would have been natural to conclude that, while the&s;e inquiries were going on
<PB N="10" REF="12">
in England, and while the attention of the nation was &s;o particularly directed to the &s;ubject as it has been lately, &s;ome re&s;traint would have been laid on practices, which it was well known had excited univer&s;al indig|nation here. One fact, which I &s;hall &s;tate, will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew you, what you have to expect from the probable effect of the&s;e pretended laws and regula|tions made in the i&s;lands for the protection of the &s;laves. It is not more than eighteen months ago that I read, in the Jamaica Gazette, an account of a female &s;lave, of the age of fifteen, flogged by one of the&s;e drivers, till &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground. In this &s;tate &s;he was dragged by the legs to a place which they call an ho&s;pi|tal, till her mangled fle&s;h was torn completely from her bones. In the ho&s;pital &s;he died. The villain was tried for his life, and honourably acquitted by twelve of his peers, every one of whom, I have a right to conclude, and, for my own part, have no &s;ort of doubt, would have done exactly the &s;ame. On what pretence was he acquitted?&mdash;Why, Sir, it was &s;aid, or pretended, that the girl was his property; that it could not be his intention, becau&s;e it was not his intere&s;t, to take away her life.</P>
<P>Sir, I have given you but a very &s;light &s;pecimen, in|deed, of the horrors, with which the&s;e books are filled. I will not argue the que&s;tion, whether we ought to en|deavour to put an end to them, or not. The very que&s;|tion is a di&s;grace to us. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, I will not at|tempt to do that, which many per&s;onal con&s;iderations would have led me to do, to endeavour to compound with my duties, and to compromi&s;e between extreme right and extreme wrong. I give my vote for abolition. I
<PB N="11" REF="13" MS="y">
declare my opinion. I would do more if I could. Were I to have done otherwi&s;e, I do not believe that I could have enjoyed happine&s;s in this world. I am &s;ure I &s;hould not have de&s;erved it hereafter.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Motion for taking into con&s;ideration the report of the Bill, <HI>for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, at a time to be limited.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Sir WILLIAM YOUNG.</P>
<P>General SMITH.</P>
<P>Mr. FRANCIS. Mr. Speaker, I really had no thoughts of taking part in this debate. My opinion of the &s;lave trade is &s;ufficiently known. But I confe&s;s I have not patience to hear what I have heard this day, without feeling indignation, and endeavouring to ex|pre&s;s it. The honourable General introduced his &s;peech with premi&s;ing, that he had no property in the We&s;t In|dies, nor any connection with tho&s;e who had. Allow me in my turn to declare that, altho' I have no pro|perty in the i&s;lands, I once was intimately connected with &s;ome, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great deal. The per&s;on, I allude to, had no relations but in <HI>my</HI> family. Her per|&s;onal fortune was very con&s;iderable. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the greate&s;t part of it would undoubtedly have gone, as in ju&s;tice it ought to have done, to her own relations, to whom &s;he always expre&s;&s;ed, as in common gratitude to me &s;he ought to have felt, the warme&s;t affection. Why was that ju&s;t and rea&s;onable expectation on our
<PB N="12" REF="14">
part di&s;appointed? Becau&s;e I did not yield to her ear|ne&s;t and repeated &s;olicitations to vote again&s;t the aboli|tion of the &s;lave trade, or at lea&s;t to be neuter. I voted and &s;poke for it, and &s;he di&s;po&s;ed of her fortune accord|ingly. The honourable General &s;ays, that we are very much at our ea&s;e, while we are voting away the pro|perty of others; that we go home to the enjoyment of our dinners and our beds, without thinking on the mi|&s;ery and ruin we are to bring on a great body of our fel|low &s;ubjects. Well, Sir, of <HI>me</HI> at lea&s;t, it cannot be &s;aid that, while I neglected or &s;acrificed <HI>their</HI> intere&s;ts, I was careful of my own. I acted with my eyes open, for I was di&s;tinctly threatened with the con&s;equence. And yet I went home that day with appetite to my din|ner, as I &s;hall to-day, and &s;lept &s;oundly that night. Had I done otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould have lo&s;t the quiet mind, without which, neither can the luxuries of the table gratify the palate, nor the bed of down give re|po&s;e. Forgive me, Sir, for &s;peaking of my&s;elf in this manner. The facts I allude to are well known to every one, who knows me. My object in referring to them is to obtain credit for my &s;incerity, in the part I now take, even with tho&s;e, who may undervalue my judg|ment. The honourable Baronet, in vehement language, and pa&s;&s;ionate terms, complains of the enormous lo&s;s and injury, which the We&s;t India proprietors and plan|ters are to &s;uffer by this bill, without any compen&s;a|tion. I deny it as a fact. But, if it were true, let them begin by entitling them&s;elves to redre&s;s, before they ex|pect that the Hou&s;e will li&s;ten to their complaint. I an&s;wer them with the authority and in the language of Engli&s;h equity, ever &s;ince equity was known in Eng|land; <HI>Do ju&s;tice before you demand it.</HI> NON FERET AEQUUM, QUI PETIT INIQUUM. As long as you are
<PB N="13" REF="15">
guilty of an enormous inju&s;tice, on the very ground and &s;ubject matter of your pretended wrongs, the court will not li&s;ten to you, even though it were true that you had &s;ome equitable claim to compen&s;ation or re|lief. The honourable Baronet &s;ays, that the preamble to the bill, in a&s;&s;erting that <HI>the &s;lave trade is contrary to the principles of ju&s;tice and humanity,</HI> is a cruel mockery of the &s;ufferings of per&s;ons in his &s;ituation, and that it adds in&s;ult to wrong. The honourable General, on the other hand, &s;ays, that it is nothing but the truth, that it was true a hundred years ago, and has continued &s;o to this hour; and therefore, I &s;uppo&s;e, he concludes it is too trite and notorious to be worth a&s;&s;erting. The ho|nourable gentlemen agree better in their views, than in their principles. The honourable Baronet &s;ays, that the &s;tate of the greater part of the We&s;t India proprietors is already &s;ufficiently di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and in many in&s;tances deplorable; that their e&s;tates are mortgaged, for nearly the whole of their actual value, to merchants and other monied men in this country; and that this bill will an|nihilate the &s;ecurity of the mortgagees. Be it &s;o. The intere&s;t then is in <HI>them,</HI> and from <HI>them</HI> we have had no petition. The honourable Baronet's anxiety about the mortgagees is extremely generous I confe&s;s; but, if his account of the actual &s;ituation of We&s;t India property be correct, the owners would &s;uffer little or nothing, even by a general foreclo&s;ure. The&s;e gentlemen recom|mend it to us not to forget policy, while we are talking of ju&s;tice; from which I can only collect that, in their minds at lea&s;t, there is an evident di&s;tinction between policy and ju&s;tice. In mine, Sir, they are the &s;ame. If there be any circum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent moment, or in the actual &s;ituation of affairs in the We&s;t Indies,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
which may render it prudent or advi&s;eable not to carry the mea&s;ure of abolition into in&s;tant execution, his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, who have the be&s;t information on &s;uch points, and who are tru&s;ted with the care of the general intere&s;ts of the empire, ought to tell us &s;o. I mu&s;t confide in their prudence. If, by withholding any nece&s;&s;ary information of fact, they &s;uffer the Hou&s;e to be mi&s;led, they are to an&s;wer for it. But, as to ge|neral and fundamental principles of policy, I want no in&s;truction from any man. I know that it is by ju&s;tice only that great empires can pre&s;erve their greatne&s;s, <HI>&s;ic fortis Etruria crevit,</HI> and that, by abandoning that prin|ciple, they in&s;ure their ruin. But, when argument fails, we are to be threatened if we per&s;i&s;t. The exam|ple of the lo&s;s of America is held up to us by way of warning not to provoke the We&s;t India i&s;lands, le&s;t they al&s;o &s;hould be lo&s;t to Great Britain. If this be a &s;peculation only, I an&s;wer it with a better;&mdash;that the events and i&s;&s;ues of human coun&s;els are at the di&s;po&s;al of a higher wi&s;dom than our's; and that tho&s;e conclu|&s;ions, which we mo&s;t &s;trongly dread and deprecate in pro&s;pect, are very often beneficial in the event. If it be a menace, I an&s;wer it with a fact. At the out&s;et of that unhappy conte&s;t, the terror held out by tho&s;e who promoted and tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it, was the lo&s;s of America; by the former if we yielded, by the latter, if we per&s;i&s;ted. But all parties agreed, that the lo&s;s of America mu&s;t be the ruin of Great Britain. America was lo&s;t; yet, in &s;pite of that lo&s;s, and of all that this country wa&s;ted and &s;uffered in attempting to recover it, Great Britain has &s;urvived, and &s;tood as firm and &s;ecure as ever; nor do I know with certainty that, &s;etting a&s;ide the expences and calamities attached to the conte&s;t,
<PB N="15" REF="17" MS="y">
Great Britain is e&s;&s;entially weakened or impoveri&s;hed by the &s;eparation of America. The honourable General &s;tates it as an ab&s;urdity in the councils of admini&s;tration to wa&s;te &s;o many lives, and to &s;quander &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money in expeditions to make conque&s;ts in the We&s;t Indies, while in effect they forbid the cultivation not only of any you may acquire, but even of tho&s;e which you po&s;&s;e&s;s. Of what u&s;e are the acqui&s;itions, if the importation of negroes be forbidden? Sir, it would be improper to enter now into the policy of the&s;e expe|ditions. That que&s;tion is not before us, nor is this the time for it. But to the objection, as it is &s;tated, the an&s;wer is obvious. On <HI>our</HI> principles, there is no con|tradiction between the policy of the expeditions, and the object of the bill. The two mea&s;ures may be con|&s;i&s;tent, at lea&s;t in the judgment of per&s;ons, who think and maintain, as I do, that the cultivation of all the lands in the We&s;t Indies may be effectually provided for without a farther importation of negroes from Africa. The honourable Baronet complains of the extreme ri|gour and &s;everity of the penalties impo&s;ed by this bill. My an&s;wer is, that if the purpo&s;es of the law be good, if the object be ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, the penalties mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to enforce the execution, and in&s;ure the effect. Beyond that point, I allow, they ought not to be ex|tended. On this part of the &s;ubject I call on the gen|tlemen of the long robe to give us their advice and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. It is properly <HI>their</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s and duty to watch the formaion of all penal acts, and to take care that they neither violate the principles, nor extend the ri|gour of our Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence without ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity. I mu&s;t own I have my doubts, whether there may not be &s;ome foundation for the apprehen&s;ion ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="18">
by the honourable Baronet, that the extreme la|titude of the terms u&s;ed in the fir&s;t clau&s;e, by which the <HI>procuring, aiding, or abetting</HI> the importation of any ne|groes, is put on the &s;ame footing with the actual im|portation, and made &s;ubject to the &s;ame penalty of tran&s;|portation for fourteen years, may involve innocent per|&s;ons in the con&s;equences of acts done without their par|ticipation, and even without their knowledge. Here again I call on the gentlemen of the long robe, to examine this matter, and give us their advice. The honourable Baronet affirms and laments that, by this clau&s;e, men of birth, fortune, and education, poli&s;hed and improved by man|ners and by learning, are liable to a puni&s;hment degrad|ing as well as rigorous, and to be confounded with fe|lons and criminals of the vile&s;t denomination. I feel the force of the objection, and wi&s;h to have it con&s;idered. At the &s;ame time, I do not think it comes with a very good grace from the honourable Baronet. When the &s;edition bill pa&s;&s;ed, he took no part to oppo&s;e it. He &s;aw no objection then to the newly-created penalty of tran&s;portation for a &s;editious libel, on a &s;econd offence. By what &s;ort of per&s;ons could that &s;ort of offence be committed? By men of learning, genius, and educa|tion. He &s;aw no objection then to the penalty of tran&s;|portation in company with felons of every de&s;cription, though po&s;&s;ibly it might fall on &s;uch a man as Mr. Burke or Dr. Parr, or on per&s;ons the mo&s;t eminent in the kingdom for literature and &s;cience. Such men, if they were obnoxious to government, would be pro&s;ecuted, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, on any trifling pretence, for the &s;ake of in&s;uring the penalty attached to the &s;econd con|viction. The honourable Baronet has different rules and mea&s;ures for offenders, who&s;e quality and character
<PB N="17" REF="19">
are the &s;ame. But ju&s;tice ought to be di&s;tributed with an equal hand to all men. The cla&s;s of the offender undoubtedly &s;hould be con&s;idered, as well as that of the offence. If, in this re&s;pect, the bill &s;hould be found liable to objection, it ought to be corrected.</P>

<P>Mr. FRANCIS ro&s;e to give notice of his intention to take the fir&s;t convenient opportunity, after the re|ce&s;s, to bring forward a motion concerning the &s;tate of negroes in the We&s;t India i&s;lands. That, in order not to load him&s;elf with unnece&s;&s;ary difficulties in an at|tempt &s;ufficiently arduous in it&s;elf, and perhaps above his capacity, by exciting groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions, or pro|voking a &s;uperfluous di&s;po&s;ition to oppo&s;e his intended propo&s;ition before it was under&s;tood, he would now &s;tate &s;hortly to the Hou&s;e, not what his object was, but what it was not. It did not relate at all to the abolition of the &s;lave trade, nor to the manumi&s;&s;ion of the &s;laves now in the i&s;lands. His purpo&s;e was to provide for another intere&s;t, which, in his opinion, tho' certainly not neglected, had never been wi&s;ely con&s;idered, or ration|ally promoted on &s;ound principles of advantage either to the ma&s;ter or the &s;lave; he meant, the real intere&s;t of the proprietor him&s;elf. If, thro' that medium, the con|dition of the &s;lave could be improved, he hoped it would not be an objection to his propo&s;ition. It was true, he
<PB N="18" REF="20">
had not till lately thought of taking an active part upon a &s;ubject, which, in other views, had been &s;o long de|bated, and to &s;o little purpo&s;e. The la&s;t unfortunate vote on the &s;lave trade had determined him to come for|ward. On one point only, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make an explicit declaration, in order to &s;helter him&s;elf from per&s;onal reproach or blame. It was true that he had taken his re&s;olution, and that, at pre&s;ent, he &s;aw no rea&s;on to think it at all likely that he &s;hould not adhere to it. Neverthele&s;s, it was po&s;&s;ible that, in the interval, con&s;iderations might occur, or be &s;ugge&s;ted to him by men wi&s;er than him&s;elf, whom he meant to con|&s;ult, or that in&s;urmountable difficulties, or &s;trong pruden|tial objections might deter or divert him from pur&s;uing his pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. If &s;o, the Hou&s;e would hear no more of it. But, if he per&s;evered in his de&s;ign, of which at pre&s;ent he had no doubt, the Hou&s;e might be a&s;&s;ured that he would apply his mind to it, with all the indu&s;try of which he was capable, and with every exer|tion of whatever faculties he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>HOUSE OF COMMONS. <DATE><HI>Monday, April</HI> 11, 1796.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. FRANCIS. Mr. Speaker, It is hardly nece&s;|&s;ary for me to &s;ay that the &s;ight of &s;o numerous an attendance, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, gives me the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction. I con&s;ider it not only as a practical acknowledgement of the importance of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, and of the intere&s;t it excites, but as an omen of &s;ucce&s;s. Convinced, as I am, of the
<PB N="19" REF="21">
intrin&s;ic merits of the cau&s;e I am engaged in, I cannot but rejoice to find that &s;o many gentlemen are &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to attend to it. The greater the number, and the more they examine it, the more I am a&s;&s;ured that, &s;ooner or later, it will make a deep and univer&s;al im|pre&s;&s;ion, and finally prevail over every oppo&s;ition. I believe, Sir, I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, without a ri&s;que of contradiction, that, including the greate&s;t learning, by which this Hou&s;e is at all times adorned and &s;ome|times in&s;tructed, there is no man here better qualified than I am to introduce a &s;erious &s;ubject of any kind with a dull, tedious, elaborate exordium. The power and the faculty being undi&s;puted, I &s;hall not abu&s;e it. In&s;tead of tormenting you with a long preface, I &s;hall &s;ubmit to the Hou&s;e &s;ome &s;hort but earne&s;t reque&s;ts, and then in&s;tantly to my &s;ubject. The fir&s;t is, that the Hou&s;e will grant me a patient audience. I a&s;k it with humi|lity for my&s;elf; but I demand it, as a debt of ju&s;tice, for my cau&s;e. On this day, it is your lot to exerci&s;e a high juri&s;diction over a que&s;tion important to a great portion of mankind, and intere&s;ting, I tru&s;t, even to tho&s;e, who think they have no concern in it. If this be your office, your patience is your duty. My &s;econd reque&s;t is, that gentlemen will have the goodne&s;s and the candour to hear me out; that they will not &s;uffer their minds to travel fa&s;ter than I do; that they will not anticipate my conclu&s;ions, and much more, that they will not conclude for me. The &s;ubject naturally divides into two parts; the principles and object on one &s;ide, the means on the other. Each of the&s;e divi&s;ions con&s;titutes of it&s;elf an entire whole, the merit of which, if it has any, will depend on the mutual re|lation, corre&s;pondence, and con&s;i&s;tency of its con&s;ti|tuent
<PB N="20" REF="22">
parts, united in one view, and acting together for one general purpo&s;e. It cannot be fairly deter|mined, or even thoroughly under&s;tood, by any con&s;i|deration of particulars, that detaches the materials from the compo&s;ition, or that values the component part with|out regard to its po&s;ition. The mo&s;t irregular fragment, in meeting another fragment, finds the place that belongs to it. But, above all things, I mu&s;t appeal to your ju&s;tice again&s;t any attempt or inclination to confound the con|&s;ideration of the two general divi&s;ions of the &s;ubject, by drawing objections from the means, and applying them to the object. The &s;econd may be eligible and practicable in its nature, though po&s;&s;ibly not by that cour&s;e, or through that medium, which to me might appear preferable to all others, if not the only one likely to be &s;ucce&s;sful. You may approve the purpo&s;e without admitting the means. But you cannot ho|ne&s;tly or rea&s;onably contend, that deci&s;ive objections to the means are nece&s;&s;arily fatal to the end. Sir, I am thoroughly con&s;cious of my own infirmities. I cannot hope to make my&s;elf under&s;tood, unle&s;s I am heard without impatience or interruption. Even &s;igns and ge&s;tures are &s;ufficient to di&s;concert me. From that &s;ort of di&s;tre&s;s, however, I hope to guard my&s;elf in &s;ome degree, by ob&s;erving a rule, which is not &s;o much regarded as it ought to be, by fixing my eye as &s;teadily as I can upon you, Sir, from whom I expect nothing but what I have always experienced&mdash;kindne&s;s, encou|ragement, and protection. There is no affectation in confe&s;&s;ing that I have but little confidence in my own &s;trength. Allow me to claim the benefit not the merit of this confe&s;&s;ion, if you believe it to be &s;incere. Con|clude
<PB N="21" REF="23">
for me, as you ought to do, that I am convinced of the &s;trength of my cau&s;e, and that I rely on it for &s;upport. That I am earne&s;t in my opinion you cannot doubt. The value of it mu&s;t be e&s;timated by others. On this day, Sir, it is eminently my duty, as it is at all times my intere&s;t and inclination, to look round me for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to conciliate, if I can, every cla&s;s of per|&s;ons and opinions, into which the Hou&s;e has been divided on the &s;ubject of the Slave Trade. To the enemies of this traffic, a re&s;olute and I hope an unconquerable phalanx, to tho&s;e, who have hitherto advi&s;ed and in|&s;i&s;ted on abolition, I think I have &s;ome right to apply for &s;upport. I have gone the full length of their opi|nions, and given them, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power; and, if ever they &s;hould think it prudent or advi&s;able, if ever they &s;hould &s;ee, what at pre&s;ent I de&s;pair of, a rational pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in that direct pur&s;uit, they &s;hall find me at my po&s;t, and as ready as ever to &s;econd their efforts. Is it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould tell me in return, as, I think, implicitly they would do by refu&s;ing to concur with me this night, that they will not &s;uffer any part or portion of that entire &s;y&s;tem, which has totally failed in their hands, to &s;ucceed in mine? They may &s;ay, perhaps, that their principles will not permit them to negotiate with guilt, or to compound with crimes, as they mu&s;t do, if they con&s;ented to palliate or to qualify an evil, which they cannot remove, and much more if they ap|peared to authorize or even to acquie&s;ce in its exi&s;tence, by contributing to reduce it to a le&s;s intolerable form. Neither would <HI>I,</HI> if I could help it. But is it true that, by yielding to nece&s;&s;ity, any principles are abandoned? Do I renounce even <HI>their</HI> object of ultimate abolition,
<PB N="22" REF="24">
or do I pur&s;ue it by a cour&s;e, perhaps more effectual, though le&s;s rapid and direct than that, which <HI>they</HI> have hitherto repeatedly tried without &s;ucce&s;s? Are there no &s;tages and gradations between complete &s;ucce&s;s and ab|&s;olute de&s;pair? Are there no expedients in practice, of which prudence &s;hould avail it&s;elf to compa&s;s whatever is attainable of the objects of wi&s;dom and benevolence? Have they a moral right to this extreme preci&s;ion in a que&s;tion of action, in which the &s;ufferings of others are in&s;tantly involved? Have they nothing to con&s;ider now but their own con&s;i&s;tency? Is it pride or is it charity to &s;ay to a fellow-creature, the &s;uffering &s;ubject of the argument and victim of the debate, that you will not &s;ubmit to relieve, becau&s;e you have been di&s;appointed in attempting to cure? From tho&s;e gentlemen I have a right to expect better morals, if not better logic. My appeal to the planters and proprietors is of a different nature, but equally intended to conciliate their good will, and to obtain their concurrence. Of <HI>them</HI> I de|mand nothing but an exact con&s;i&s;tency between their conduct this day and all their former profe&s;&s;ions. <HI>They cannot con&s;ent to aboli&s;h; but they are ready and de&s;irous to regulate and to improve.</HI> Such has been their con&s;tant language, whenever abolition has been propo&s;ed. They are at all times ready to meliorate the per&s;onal con|dition of the Negro, tho' not to put an end to the trade.&mdash;Now I take the&s;e gentlemen at their word. Let us heartily and hone&s;tly unite our endeavours to accompli&s;h that, which they are willing to concur in, which they confe&s;s ought to be done, to place the Negroes in the I&s;lands on &s;uch a footing of regu|lated &s;ervice, no longer at per&s;onal di&s;cretion, but under a legal &s;ecurity, that the exi&s;tence of the trade
<PB N="23" REF="25">
it&s;elf for a farther period may po&s;&s;ibly be endured. Some of the parties, I am told, are highly di&s;&s;atisfied at my attempting to revive the &s;ubject in any &s;hape. <HI>For what purpo&s;e do you &s;tir a que&s;tion, now finally &s;ettled by a re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e? Are we never to be at re&s;t?</HI> To a complaint of this kind I might truly an&s;wer, that if <HI>I</HI> were &s;ilent, or if <HI>I</HI> were not in being, there are others, who would re&s;ume the &s;ubject with as much zeal, and with greater ability; who would never &s;uffer it to peri&s;h or be forgotten. On this point the gentle|men I allude to may as well re&s;olve at once to make up their minds to their &s;ituation. They may be a&s;&s;ured, that as long as the grievance exi&s;ts, at lea&s;t in its pre&s;ent form, they will have no repo&s;e; they can never be at re&s;t. But this is not <HI>my</HI> language. It would have the air of an apology, which I will never make to any party or to any power, for endeavouring to do one of the greate&s;t duties incident to my &s;tation. In doing it I want no &s;helter, nor would I &s;toop to &s;olicit it from any human re&s;entment. I tell them frankly that, while I exi&s;t, the que&s;tion &s;hall never die; and tho' it were dead, yet &s;hall it live. Some years ago it was &s;aid by a Member of this Hou&s;e, re&s;pectable for his age,&mdash;where he is now I know not,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why cannot you be content? Are not we all very happy? Do not we enjoy good dinners and plea&s;ant &s;ociety, and all manner of comforts? I dare &s;ay the Negroes are very well off, and why cannot you let them be quiet?"</Q> My an&s;wer was and is, that &s;uch principles and practice never ought to find peace on earth. It is in vain to look for it. By power and by force they may obtain a partial triumph from day to day; but it mu&s;t be in a perpetual &s;truggle between active wrong
<PB N="24" REF="26">
and per&s;evering right, until the moral &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, charity, and &s;hame, &s;hall either finally prevail or be ut|terly extingui&s;hed in this land. To any other i&s;&s;ue the war is immortal. Addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf now to the Hou&s;e collectively, I certainly mean to do it with the de|ference and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that becomes me. If I could per&s;onify the Hou&s;e of Commons, it would be my in|tere&s;t as well as my duty to approach &s;o great a per&s;on with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect. But re&s;pect does not exclude firmne&s;s, and &s;hould not re&s;train me from &s;aying, that it is the function of your greatne&s;s, as well as of your office, to li&s;ten to truth, e&s;pecially when it arraigns a proceeding of your own. I am not here to admire your con&s;i&s;tency, or to applaud the conduct which I am en|deavouring to correct. The&s;e topics do not furni&s;h any &s;ubject for applau&s;e. You have nothing like prai&s;e to expect from me; unle&s;s you feel, as I do, that a compliment of the highe&s;t order is included in the con|fidence, which appeals to your ju&s;tice again&s;t your in|clination. Compare the re&s;olutions of the &s;ame Hou&s;e of Commons in 1792 and 1796. Again&s;t the &s;econd I plead the fir&s;t, the re&s;ult of a longer debate, the deci|&s;ion of a greater majority. If the authorities are equal, to which &s;hall we &s;ubmit? Contradictions cannot act together. Is it po&s;&s;ible to remember the pledge that was given, the faith that was engaged, and really to re&s;pect a power, by which both have been broken? It is not for <HI>me</HI> to qualify the proceedings of this Hou&s;e. But they can not e&s;cape the records of hi&s;tory. To &s;ave you from everla&s;ting di&s;honour, that leaf mu&s;t be torn out. There is one per&s;on left, Sir, who&s;e &s;up|port, if I really had it, would undoubtedly be of more u&s;e than all the re&s;t; but who&s;e &s;upport I di&s;dain to
<PB N="25" REF="27">
&s;olicit. I will not, for any purpo&s;e of this world, much le&s;s for any intere&s;t of my own, de&s;cend from the independence of my character, or from the &s;tation attached to the duty of this day, to &s;ubmit my&s;elf to a capricious, mean, injurious enmity, not the le&s;s bitter becau&s;e utterly groundle&s;s, not the le&s;s per&s;evering be|cau&s;e utterly unprovoked. Neither is it nece&s;&s;ary. I have a &s;urer cour&s;e to take with the Right Honour|able per&s;on I allude to. If I am not gro&s;&s;ly mi&s;ta|ken in my opinion of his character, I have a power|ful re&s;ource in the judicial quality of his calculating mind. I am not alluding now to the general purity of his morals, or to his &s;incerity in particular. Without di&s;puting his virtues, I hold it to be fortunate that I am not driven to rely on them. I depend on his &s;upport, becau&s;e I think I can put an honourable force upon his mind. I know the &s;cruples and the prudence, with which he weighs and balances the &s;pecific value of pro|fit again&s;t prai&s;e. Whatever you may think of him, he is not a man to be driven, even by a favourite pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;acrifice a great portion of reputation for an incon&s;i|derable advantage, and &s;till le&s;s for a gratuitous indul|gence of temper. I am &s;afe, then, when I &s;ay, that my pre&s;ent intention is neither to &s;olicit or to offend, but to provoke him, <HI>(Hear! hear!)</HI>&mdash;Yes, Sir, not to offend, but to provoke. Provocation is not of ne|ce&s;&s;ity offence. To inflame is not to irritate. They know nothing of the language, who think that the&s;e words repre&s;ent the &s;ame idea. I tell him frankly that the la&s;t deci&s;ion of the Hou&s;e has left a &s;hade, I will not call it a &s;tain upon his reputation. Is he not yet &s;atiated with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power and emolument? Is he not weary of the drudgery of his office, compared to which
<PB N="26" REF="28">
the mere labour of a Negro is in my mind a &s;ervice to be endured? And does he think it po&s;&s;ible that the country, that any rational being &s;hould give credit to a propo&s;ition &s;o extravagant and &s;o mon&s;trous, that the all-power|ful Mini&s;ter of the Crown, with all his eloquence, and with all his influence, and with the acce&s;&s;ion of thirty voices from this &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, &s;hould not have been able to engage more than &s;eventy votes on a favourite que&s;tion of his own, If, in earne&s;t and <HI>bon&acirc; fide,</HI> he had de&s;ired to carry it? Is there nothing in his mind to elevate him for a moment above the level of his &s;tation? Does he never look forward to a time, when the merits of his character will be canva&s;&s;ed by po&s;terity?

<P>Mr. Secretary DUNDAS ro&s;e to call the Honorable Gentleman to order.

That to a&s;&s;ert or in&s;i|nuate the contrary was unparliamentary, and a high breach of order.</P>
<P>Mr. FRANCIS. I &s;ubmit to correction, though I really do not think that I &s;aid any thing to de&s;erve it. Certainly what I meant was, not to expre&s;s a &s;u&s;picion of my own concerning the Right Honorable Gentle|man's &s;incerity, but to indicate to him the impre&s;&s;ion which the fact, as it &s;tood, &s;eemed likely to make on the general judgment of mankind at pre&s;ent and here|after. I have no time now to debate a point of or|der;
<PB N="27" REF="29">
nor is it nece&s;&s;ary. The full idea, which I meant to give, may be conveyed in another form. In&s;tead of a comment, allow me to tell you a &s;hort &s;tory, from good authority; but whether it be true or not is immaterial. It will &s;erve to illu&s;trate an ob&s;cure &s;ubject, without the ri&s;que of giving offence. A Member of this honorable Hou&s;e was a&s;ked, how he voted on the la&s;t que&s;tion of abolition. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, I voted with my friend the Mini&s;ter."</Q> How &s;o? I thought you had divided again&s;t the Bill.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Very true; I certainly divided again&s;t the Bill; but I voted with my friend the Mini&s;ter."</Q> At the moment, when the Secretary of State called me to order, I was going to make an acknowledgement in favour of the Right Ho|nourable Gentleman, and to pay him, what I never re|fu&s;e even to ho&s;tile merit, an hone&s;t tribute of ap|plau&s;e. What judgement I po&s;&s;e&s;s is a good deal go|verned by impre&s;&s;ion. I cannot calculate the value, while I feel the effect. I have not forgotten that illu&s;trious night<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monday, 2d April, 1792.</NOTE>, when all the powers of his elo|quence were &s;ummoned to the &s;ervice, and exerted in the defence of ju&s;tice and humanity;&mdash;when he took the Hou&s;e, at a late hour, exhau&s;ted with watching and wearied with debate;&mdash;when worn out attention revived at his voice; &mdash; when he carried conviction to our hearts;&mdash;when rea&s;on in his hand &s;eemed to have no office but to excite the be&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions in our brea&s;ts;&mdash;then, Sir, was the time, if he had nothing to con&s;ider but his own glory, then was the moment for him to have cho&s;en to retire from Parliament, perhaps from the world. He had arrived at the pinnacle of
<PB N="28" REF="30">
parliamentary honor, and at the &s;ummit of his fame; and there he &s;hould have quitted the &s;cene. From that moment and from that &s;tation, in <HI>my</HI> judgment, he has done nothing but de&s;cend. If the effort I allude to was no more than the imitation of an action, we may find &s;uch imitations &s;till better repre&s;ented in books, or as well acted on the &s;tage, where reality is not in que&s;tion. I do not &s;u&s;pect his &s;incerity on that occa|&s;ion. But, whether that was an imitation or not, mine is a real action; or, if it be an error, it is <HI>I</HI> who am the dupe of it. I well know the dilemma, in which I am to &s;tand this day. If the motion I have in view &s;ucceeds, I &s;hall then be driven to &s;ubmit to a conti|nuance of the trade. If it fails, the whole exi&s;ting mi&s;|chief receives another confirmation. But on the other hand, if I &s;ucceed, a great immediate good is done, progre&s;&s;ive in its nature, and inevitably leading to final abolition. If I fail, one material advantage will be gained by it, that the pretences &s;et up by tho&s;e, who &s;ay they cannot yield to abolition, will be unma&s;ked; and that, with re&s;pect to <HI>them</HI> at lea&s;t, we &s;hall know what we have to tru&s;t to. Such is the perpetual mix|ture of good and evil, that embarra&s;&s;es the choice and balances the event of human councils. We cannot command the i&s;&s;ue; let us make &s;ure of the intent. The fir&s;t que&s;tion that will naturally occur to all par|ties is to a&s;k me, what is your general intention? You &s;ay, you do not now propo&s;e to aboli&s;h the trade. Do you mean to emancipate the Negroes in the I&s;lands? In effect, Sir, I have an&s;wered that que&s;tion already. It cannot be my intention, becau&s;e it is not in my power, nor would I venture it, if it were. Before I di&s;charged them from their pre&s;ent evil condition, I
<PB N="29" REF="31">
&s;hould be bound to provide for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;e|curity in a better. Otherwi&s;e their freedom, unpre|pared and unprovided for, might be their in&s;tant de|&s;truction. They mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on the &s;pot, and in&s;tructed to make u&s;e of them. Liberty, like all other human advantages and enjoyments, has difficulties of its own, which he, who has been bred in &s;lavery, will not &s;uddenly know how to contend with. In &s;ome ca&s;es the planters are ready enough to make their &s;laves free, that is, to turn them adrift when from age or infirmity they are pa&s;t their labour, and leave them at liberty to &s;hift for them|&s;elves. For this proof of the liberality of planters, the Hou&s;e, I imagine, will give them but little credit. The &s;ame principle operates thro' all their conduct. Their &s;ole con&s;ideration is the profit or the lo&s;s. The Negro, in every &s;tage of his exi&s;tence, is, &s;ome way or other, the &s;ubject of cruelty or inju&s;tice, of which the final effort, when it can exact no more, is to refine upon all the re&s;t, and at la&s;t to &s;et him free. I do not &s;ay that &s;uch conduct has been univer&s;al. Undoubted|ly &s;ome planters are wi&s;er and more humane than others. But that the practice I allude to has prevailed, I affirm from the be&s;t evidence, from the laws of the I&s;lands, which declare the fact, and pretend to put a &s;top to it. But for what rea&s;on? Is it becau&s;e ju&s;tice or humanity forbid that the&s;e helple&s;s wretches &s;hould be let loo&s;e to &s;tarve and to peri&s;h at the period of their &s;ervice? No, Sir; no &s;uch thing. The laws inter|po&s;e, avowedly, for no purpo&s;e but to de&s;troy a nui|&s;ance, to remove an eye-&s;ore, or to di&s;courage theft. The&s;e immoral beings, it &s;eems, are determined to eat. If you will not give them food, they take it by &s;tealth.
<PB N="30" REF="32">
The appropriated rights of nouri&s;hment are invaded by the&s;e free Negroes. No edible property is &s;ecure from them. And is that an evil to be endured for a moment by an enlightened legi&s;lature?&mdash;No, Sir, it is not my de&s;ign to give &s;uch freedom on &s;uch terms; nor will I leave it to the ma&s;ter to di&s;&s;olve the relation between his &s;lave and him&s;elf, ju&s;t whenever he plea&s;es. The next que&s;tion, I expect, is;&mdash;Do you mean to give the Negroes equal rights with the white inhabitants? That would be a direct emancipation. What I would do immediately, if I could, would be to place them in a &s;tate equivalent to that of voluntary &s;ervice. That &s;tep will follow in due time; but it mu&s;t be preceded by other gradations. To aboli&s;h &s;ervice in &s;ociety, is in fact to aboli&s;h man. You have heard of fanciful definitions, that man is an animal <HI>bipes et implume,</HI> that man alone makes in&s;truments to act with; but there is no di&s;tinction perhaps more &s;triking, more prominent and characteri&s;tic, than that he alone of all created beings makes u&s;e of the &s;ervice of creatures of his own &s;pecies. But &s;ervice is not &s;lavery. It is the free man's calling. In effect, &s;lavery is the rever&s;e of &s;ervice. In&s;tead of bad &s;laves I would make the Negroes good &s;ervants. I am &s;ure that the ma&s;ter's profit, on the whole, would grow with the freedom, and that even his morals would be minded by it. A good ma&s;ter makes a good &s;ervant, and, <HI>vice ver&s;&aacute;,</HI> a good &s;ervant makes a good ma&s;ter. The principles act and react on each other. But we are yet at too great a di&s;|tance from this humble &s;tate of improvement. I do not aim at it immediately. Then what is it you pro|po&s;e? I mean, Sir, generally, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to allow the Negroes every benefit and advantage com|patible
<PB N="31" REF="33">
with a rational and profitable demand on their &s;ervice; to mend their actual condition, to prepare them gradually for a better &s;ituation, and to make them capable of higher improvements. The cour&s;e and the power &s;hall be &s;tated in their place. But, fir&s;t of all, let us inquire and con&s;ider, what is the actual &s;tate of the Negroes in the I&s;lands. I mean to repre&s;ent it fairly on both &s;ides. In a printed tract, called <HI>A true State of the Que&s;tion,</HI> drawn up with great artifice, under an air of &s;implicity, I find the following pa&s;&s;age, which the author evidently means &s;hould be taken for a general and candid account of the Negroes in the plantations. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They have a hou&s;e and garden <HI>for nothing,</HI> clothes found them, food found them, both good and &s;ufficient, the be&s;t doctors in the country to attend them when &s;ick, their wives and children provided for, <HI>and all without any expence.</HI> The par|&s;on, who lived there three years, &s;ays this is the general &s;tate of the Negroes on all the plantations he &s;aw; and that in a great many parts they catch, by means of &s;pringes or &s;nares, abundance of wild pigeons and Guinea hens."</Q> Undoubtedly, Sir, if the Negroes are really furni&s;hed with all the&s;e conveniences and amu&s;ements, there is no occa&s;ion to tell us that it mu&s;t be <HI>without any expence</HI> to them. They land naked, and they cannot acquire. To &s;ay that they have them <HI>for nothing,</HI> is only to a&s;&s;ert that their labour is of no value. But does any man in his &s;en&s;es believe the &s;tatement to be true? If it be, the fortunate i&s;lands were never di&s;|covered before. <HI>Grenada and St. Kitt's</HI> are the real <HI>He&s;|perides.</HI> A &s;ugar plantation mu&s;t be a perfect paradi&s;e. Be it &s;o. I take the&s;e gentlemen at their word. In a&s;&s;erting the fact, they allow the right. To affirm
<PB N="32" REF="34">
that &s;uch <HI>is</HI> the practice already, is to confe&s;s that &s;uch it ought to be. Their allegation is an admi&s;&s;ion. Al|mo&s;t all that I contend for is acknowledged to be right, and in effect, if they &s;peak truth, already granted and enjoyed. Inforce your practice. Compel tho&s;e plan|ters, if there be any, who neglect or refu&s;e to follow your benevolent example. Confirm your own cu&s;tom by &s;ome legal &s;anction, and make it binding on all par|ties. The rights, which are held at di&s;cretion, may be capriciou&s;ly re&s;umed; and, even while they are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, can hardly be enjoyed. You cannot an&s;wer for the ju&s;tice and humanity of your &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. It is not ab&s;olutely certain that your virtues will de&s;cend with your e&s;tates. Since in effect you give the &s;ub&s;tance, for what rea&s;on &s;hould you refu&s;e the &s;ecurity? Your Negroes will not work with le&s;s diligence, when they know that their indu&s;try and obedience are the <HI>certain</HI> tenure of their happine&s;s. As long as they have no|thing to lo&s;e, they are not properly within the reach of good government. At lea&s;t it is worth trying, whe|ther the fear of forfeiture may not be full as effectual as the dread of puni&s;hment. I mu&s;t call upon you now, Sir, to attend to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of this flattering re|pre&s;entation;&mdash;after looking at the picture, to turn the frame and examine the canvas. Very different indeed is the view, which I &s;hall endeavour to give you of the condition of the&s;e &s;laves; but it is that, which I mo&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly believe to be true. The reality of the ca&s;e, as I &s;hall &s;tate it, is founded in the &s;tronge&s;t pro|bability and rational pre&s;umption on general princi|ples; is &s;upported by direct evidence, and above all things is demon&s;trated by unavoidable inference from the laws of the I&s;lands. My chief reliance is on the
<PB N="33" REF="35">
la&s;t, becau&s;e, tho' not in its nature &s;o direct as oral te&s;timony, it is the only &s;ort of evidence, which it is impo&s;&s;ible for any adver&s;e party to contradict or di&s;pute. At the &s;ame time, Sir, I de&s;ire it to be under&s;tood that what I &s;tate on this &s;ubject is &s;tated generally. I do not mean to deny that &s;ome plantations are better ma|naged than others; that, in &s;ome places, very prudent and humane regulations have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, and par|ticularly that, when proprietors, who commonly re|&s;ide in England, have vi&s;ited their e&s;tates, their occa|&s;ional pre&s;ence has been a ble&s;&s;ing to their &s;laves. Knowing and e&s;teeming many of them, as I do, and living in friend&s;hip with others, I &s;hould betray my cau&s;e as well as my honour, if I did not much more than admit, if I did not contend that a great part of the mi&s;eries &s;uffered by the &s;laves is in fact owing to the con&s;tant ab&s;ence of the proprietors, and would probably be removed or alleviated by their pre&s;ence. Had it been <HI>my</HI> lot to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate in the We&s;t Indies by gift or inheritance,&mdash;&s;uch property a&s;&s;uredly I never would have acquired by an act of my own,&mdash;I &s;hould have thought it my duty, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, again&s;t every motive of per&s;onal reluctance and di&s;like, to have vi&s;ited my e&s;tate, to have examined the condi|tion and treatment of my Negroes with my own eyes, and, before I allowed my&s;elf to think of any thing el&s;e, to give and in&s;ure to them at lea&s;t as much com|fort and happine&s;s as might be compatible with the de|mand of a rea&s;onable and a <HI>fixed</HI> proportion of the amount produce of their labour. What more I would have done, in the &s;ame pur&s;uit, may be collected more u&s;e|fully from the &s;cheme, which I am gradually unfolding to the Hou&s;e, than from an abrupt declaration of it
<PB N="34" REF="36">
at pre&s;ent. Speaking generally then, and not without exception, of the actual &s;ituation of Negroes in the We&s;t Indies, I &s;ay it appears to me, from all the evi|dence to which I have alluded, that they are a collec|tion of human beings, exi&s;ting together, but not in a &s;tate of Society;&mdash;that they are under no law, but that of arbitrary will;&mdash;that they know of no govern|ment, but the whip;&mdash;that they have no effective pro|tection, in laws or in magi&s;trates, again&s;t per&s;onal cruelty on the part of tho&s;e white men, who exerci&s;e the offices, too often united in one per&s;on, of mana|gers, over&s;eers, and drivers, nor any &s;helter what&s;oever from the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments, but in the prudence or humanity of tho&s;e officers;&mdash;that there is no bond of marriage among them;&mdash;and finally that, in this &s;tate, they neither have, nor can have, nor in fact is it in|tended that they &s;hould have, any idea of morals or re|ligion. If this be generally their condition, it follows of cour&s;e that, even if the propagation of Negroes in the I&s;lands were not directly di&s;couraged, as it is, by the planters, they could not increa&s;e and multiply, as be|yond all doubt they would do, if they were to partake of the common benefits of &s;ociety, or even if they were &s;ure of protection from outrageous wrongs. The cau&s;e is proved by the effect. They, who affirm that the con|trary is true, that propagation is really encouraged and protected, are bound to &s;hew, why they have not &s;uc|ceeded in the cour&s;e of a century, and why a continued importation of adult Negroes from Africa is &s;till nece&s;|&s;ary. If you tru&s;t to their experience of the effect of their own mea&s;ures, the nece&s;&s;ity can never cea&s;e. You mu&s;t perpetuate the importation. I wait with curio&s;ity to hear, with what arguments and proofs they &s;upport
<PB N="35" REF="37">
&s;o extraordinary a propo&s;ition. They will find it a difficult ta&s;k; and they may be &s;ure of my attention to every thing they &s;ay. Not a word of it &s;hall be lo&s;t. But, until I receive new lights on this part of the &s;ub|ject, I mu&s;t continue in my pre&s;ent conviction, that there is no marriage among the Negroes (by which I do not mean a ca&s;ual cohabitation, but a real bond of union), becau&s;e there is no protection to marriage, and that, without marriage, there can be no certain propa|gation, or care of the infant. For what rea&s;on &s;hould a Negro marry? That his wife, if &s;he has any per|&s;onal attractions, may be at the mercy and di&s;po&s;al of the driver, who whips them both? That his children, if they are &s;uffered to live, may be &s;laves like him&s;elf? And do the&s;e people expect us to believe, that the pro|ductive power of mere animal in&s;tinct, if in fact it were protected and encouraged, is &s;ufficient to overcome the moral order of nature, and the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence? Promi&s;cuous cohabitation is generally ad|ver&s;e to increa&s;e; but, in the ca&s;e of the Negroes, tho' birth were not prevented, death mu&s;t follow. What care do you think is likely to be taken of the mother or the child, when children are con&s;idered as a lo&s;s and a burthen to the e&s;tate?&mdash;Do you mean then to impart directly to the Negroes, now in the We&s;t Indies, the immediate benefit and enjoyment, as far as a &s;tate of &s;ervitude is capable of it, of law and government, of morals and religion? No, Sir, that is not my inten|tion. I know too well that they are not in a &s;tate to receive the&s;e benefits, or to profit by them. You might as well attempt to &s;ow wheat upon a mar|ble table, or on a gravel walk, and expect a plentiful crop in return. Before you plant, you mu&s;t prepare
<PB N="36" REF="38">
the &s;oil; otherwi&s;e the expence is wa&s;ted, and the la|bour thrown away. Something mu&s;t be done, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to rai&s;e their degraded minds, and to ex|cite their faculties, before you attempt to make them productive. What idea can they form of a govern|ment, or how can they regard it, from which they ex|perience nothing but puni&s;hment? How can they con|fide in laws, which place no confidence in <HI>them,</HI> and from which they derive no protection? What concep|tion can they have, or would it be po&s;&s;ible to give them, of moral obligations, as long as they exi&s;t with|out a &s;ocial relation of any kind, not only to the whites, who to <HI>them</HI> are a di&s;tinct order of beings, but even to one another. Many well-meaning per&s;ons, I know, have wi&s;hed and endeavoured to impart to the Negroes &s;ome notion of a Deity and &s;ome &s;en&s;e of religion. Without blaming the intention, I lament the mi&s;appli|cation of a pious principle, and the inutility of a vir|tuous attempt. Again I entreat the Hou&s;e, mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly on this point, not to anticipate my argument, not to conclude ha&s;tily either for me or again&s;t me. My language, on this &s;ubject, may be offen&s;ive to vul|gar ears, or to &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers; but examine it well, and you will find, that it proceeds from the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the truth and rea&s;on of religion. The&s;e &s;erious con&s;iderations are not foreign from my purpo&s;e. The legi&s;lator, who leaves religion out of his &s;cheme of government, whatever it may be, knows nothing of human nature, and but little of his office. But, in all the operations of human contrivance, gradation and order are e&s;&s;ential to &s;ucce&s;s. It is only for the hand of the Creator to act, by in&s;tant in&s;titution, univer&s;ally and at once. The Negroes, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, are
<PB N="37" REF="39">
incapable of the benefits of religion, becau&s;e they are not prepared to receive them. To give them, as they are, a confu&s;ed idea of a Power and Providence above them (which is the utmo&s;t you can do) would be much wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s and ineffectual. I &s;ay it would be dangerous. In failing, you only wa&s;te your time. I dread nothing but your &s;ucce&s;s. Expo&s;e, if you will, the aweful rites and ceremonies of your religion to mockery and profanation. Bapti&s;e your dogs. Bapti&s;e your hor&s;es. The&s;e animals you care&s;s. They feed from your hands; and, above all things, they do not know that they are your &s;laves. But beware of the la&s;t act of human impiety. Beware of per&s;uading the Negro of the exi&s;tence of a Being, of who&s;e power and attributes he can know nothing, but in the mi&s;eries it inflicts, or permits to be inflicted upon him. In his pre&s;ent &s;tate, do you expect him to li&s;ten to religious in&s;truction, or to under&s;tand it, if he does? Be it &s;o. You have taught him to believe, or to pretend to be|lieve, what he does not under&s;tand, the exi&s;tence of a providential Power above us. In what manner is he likely to be affected by that belief, or what conclu&s;ion will he draw from it? His &s;imple rea&s;on will tell him, in effect, that <HI>to him</HI> it is an ab&s;tract propo&s;i|tion; that, whether true or fal&s;e, he has no manner of concern in it; or that, if there be a God, he is not the equal protector of his creatures; that all the bene|fits of exi&s;tence are re&s;erved for the whites, and nothing for <HI>his</HI> colour, but degradation, &s;lavery, and &s;tripes. Is this the impre&s;&s;ion you wi&s;h to make by your in|&s;tructions? Whatever you may intend, the untu|tored mind of the Negro is incapable of any other. What then? Is it my purpo&s;e to keep the Negroes as
<PB N="38" REF="40">
they are, without a &s;en&s;e of the truth, or a &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ings of religion? God forbid. My intention is directly the rever&s;e. I have con&s;ulted the Book of Wi&s;dom, and &s;hall follow the precept as it is written. He, who reads that book without emotion, in my mind, has no feeling; he, who reads it without reli&s;h, has no ta&s;te. Begin with your&s;elves. Do not intercept all the goodne&s;s of Providence in its pa&s;&s;age. Let &s;ome portion of its benefits e&s;cape from your gra&s;p, and de|&s;cend to your fellow-creatures. By degrees the Negro will conceive, without envy, that it is <HI>your</HI> lot to oc|cupy an order of exi&s;tence above him, con&s;i&s;tent with his happine&s;s, and po&s;&s;ibly the medium, thro' which he is to receive it. Give him benefits, and he will re|turn thanks; give him hope, and he will pray. Why &s;hould he be grateful now, or for what purpo&s;e &s;hould he pray? De&s;pair never prays; extreme guilt, rarely. The publican hid his face. You have heard of the parable of the &s;ower and the &s;eed. From a man, who&s;e life has been wa&s;ted in the pur&s;uit of bu&s;ine&s;s or of plea&s;ure, and perpetually traver&s;ed by di&s;appointment in detail, tho' &s;ucce&s;sful in the re&s;ult, the&s;e things may have more weight, perhaps, than if they came di|rectly from the temple and the teacher. The only &s;eed, which <HI>brought forth fruit,</HI> was that, which <HI>fell into good ground.</HI> The good ground is that, which is duely prepared. Without cultivation, the riche&s;t &s;oil pro|duces weeds, and nothing el&s;e. If then you &s;eriou&s;ly and rationally mean to give religion to the Negro, pre|pare his mind to receive it. By what means? By direct information? By po&s;itive in&s;truction? No. Give him a footing on the ground, tho' it were but a point. Give him a &s;tation in &s;ociety, even the lowe&s;t that can

be found. At pre&s;ent he has none. He belongs to no order. Give him &s;ome tenure in the earth, if you mean to exalt his thoughts to any thing above it. His mind is ela&s;tic as well as your's; but it mu&s;t have &s;omething &s;olid to act upon. The&s;e are the premi&s;es. Then what is the conclu&s;ion? In one word, give pro|perty to the Negroes. What! property to a &s;lave! to a being, who is not the ma&s;ter of his own actions, who is not the owner of him&s;elf! Yes, I &s;ay, property to a &s;lave. I mean a property in the &s;oil, the be&s;t for <HI>their</HI> u&s;e, the mo&s;t convenient for your&s;elves, qualified and limited on one &s;ide, and accompanied on the other with time and means to cultivate, and &s;ecurity to enjoy. Without tho&s;e conditions, the mere grant of property would be nominal and nugatory. I am not alluding to goods and chattels, but to a real tho' inferior tenure in the land. To that &s;ort of property, in all its degrees, cultivation is the origin of right, antecedent to laws and even to &s;ociety. But, if that propo&s;ition be true, how peculiarly powerful is the inference in favour of the Negro? The moment you forced him to work, you gave him the claim, and much more than I con|tend for. To &s;ome participation at lea&s;t, the labour and the right are in&s;eparable. I &s;ay that the protection of property is the cau&s;e and foundation of &s;ociety. In that &s;ingle and &s;imple principle is involved, and out of it will gradually unfold, the benefits, the orders, and the improvements of &s;ocial life. In that acorn the whole oak is included. Give it time to take root; give protection to the plant; let it thrive and flouri&s;h. The ornament and the u&s;e will pay you here|after. The branches, as they expand, will &s;helter you from the &s;torm. The maje&s;tic &s;tem it&s;elf, even when

it falls, will be devoted to your &s;ervice. From this &s;ingle act of giving property to the Negroes, the im|provement of their faculties and character as well as of their condition will gradually and nece&s;&s;a|rily proceed, or on this &s;tock it may he grafted. The cultivation of the earth is not merely the &s;ource of nouri&s;hment, or comforts, or per&s;onal enjoyments, but of order, laws, art, and &s;cience, of every thing that is mo&s;t refined, and mo&s;t purely intellectual in the human &s;y&s;tem. Even eloquence, mu&s;ic and poetry, tho' la&s;t in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, are the progeny of the earth. Morality and religion undoubtedly derive from a higher &s;ource. But this is the medium, thro' which they are conveyed to us. PRIMA DEDIT LEGES, CERERIS SUNT OMNIA MUNUS. You may not believe in the in&s;piration of poetry; but I am &s;ure you will li&s;ten and &s;ubmit to the wi&s;dom of a king. You have it from royal autho|rity, that <HI>truth &s;hall &s;pring and flouri&s;h</HI> OUT OF THE EARTH. What can that &s;entence mean, but that hu|man knowledge, with all its illu&s;trations in &s;ociety, was intended to originate from the clod, broken by the &s;pade, or turned by the plough; and that the labour be&s;towed upon the earth is the fir&s;t &s;tep to the cultiva|tion of the mind. Before I proceed to &s;pecify the &s;ort of property, in which I wi&s;h the Negroes to partici|pate, I am bound to &s;hew generally that rights of pro|perty are not incompatible with a &s;tate even of ab&s;o|lute &s;lavery, and that in fact they have exi&s;ted toge|ther, under governments, which, in other re&s;pects, exhibited no &s;ign of lenity, or even mercy, to their &s;laves. It was the practical wi&s;dom or policy of tho&s;e &s;tates which, only in this re&s;pect, and for a public purpo&s;e, pre&s;cribed a limit to the power of the
<PB N="41" REF="43">
ma&s;ter, tho', in all other in&s;tances, utterly arbitrary and uncontrouled. By the cu&s;tom of Rome, if not by po&s;itive in&s;titution, the &s;lave might acquire, by extra-work, or by &s;avings on his allowance of grain, a <HI>pecu|lium</HI> or private property, which the ma&s;ter could not take from him, tho' he might di&s;po&s;e of his per&s;on. I do not know that the <HI>peculium</HI> was provided for by the laws of the Twelve Tables; but it was con&s;idered as a cu&s;tomary right, and protected by the <HI>Praetor.</HI> This money, with their ma&s;ter's permi&s;&s;ion, they laid out at intere&s;t, or purcha&s;ed with it a &s;lave for them|&s;elves, from who&s;e labour they might make profit. They might buy out their liberty, and have their names in&s;erted in the cen&s;or's roll; by which they ob|tained &s;ome of the advantages attached to the condition of a Roman citizen, tho' the relation between the freedman and his ma&s;ter was not entirely di&s;&s;olved. Even while the bond continues, the allowance of, or the connivance at petty profits by the &s;laves tends of it&s;elf to &s;often and efface the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;lavery, and to convert it gradually into the condition of voluntary &s;ervice. The e&s;&s;ential difference between &s;lavery and &s;ervice is, that one is forced, the other is voluntary. <HI>Monte&s;quieu</HI> &s;ays that, in Germany, the labour of the mines, in it&s;elf &s;evere and odious beyond all others, was maintained by the encouragement of little privi|leges, perqui&s;ites, and profits to the miners; that they were even brought to love their condition, and to live happily in it. From this fact he concludes, that there is no labour that man can execute, which may not be performed by freemen. <HI>My</HI> conclu&s;ion from it is, that the more of freedom you can impart to a &s;lave, the more he will labour, provided it be ac|companied
<PB N="42" REF="44">
with a gradual acce&s;&s;ion of profit. <HI>Cu|pidilate peculii nullam conditionem recu&s;ant duri&s;&s;imae &s;ervi|tutis.</HI> In &s;ociety, or in contact with &s;ociety, I hold that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, of &s;ome kind and to &s;ome degree, is more nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;lave than to a free|man. It tends to give him not only comfort but pro|tection, and nece&s;&s;arily prepares him not only for &s;o|cial benefits, but for per&s;onal improvement. The &s;avage is &s;atisfied with his liberty. In&s;tead of &s;ta|tionary labour, he ranges for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and, having little or no idea of property, has &s;till le&s;s of laws or &s;ettlement. In &s;ociety, a free man may do without property; becau&s;e he is free. His liberty is his free|hold. Without acqui&s;ition, he <HI>may</HI> have enjoyment. But, in &s;ome way or other, he mu&s;t &s;erve, or he mu&s;t labour. So ma&s;t we all, tho' in different &s;en&s;es, or in oppo&s;ite directions. The many cannot govern the few, nor do they de&s;ire it. But is there a rank in &s;ociety, including the highe&s;t, in which the ma&s;ter in effect is not very often more a &s;ervant to his &s;ervants, than they are to <HI>him?</HI> From my own experience, tho' on a little &s;cale, I can affirm it to be true. But the relations between the different cla&s;&s;es of man|kind, to be u&s;efully maintained for any, mu&s;t be reciprocally ob&s;erved by all. In the lowe&s;t &s;itua|tions of life, the people know, as well as we do, that wherever per&s;onal indu&s;try is encouraged and property protected, there mu&s;t be inequalities of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently di&s;tinction of ranks. Then come the form and the order, by which the &s;ub&s;tance is at once de|fined and pre&s;erved. Di&s;tribution and limitation pre|vent confu&s;ion, and government by orders is the natural re&s;ult of property protected by freedom. Take care
<PB N="43" REF="45">
that you adhere to it. Where the few po&s;&s;e&s;s all, and the multitude have nothing, there is no government by orders. Every thing is in extremity, and nothing in gradation. It is ignorance or calumny to &s;ay, that if the poor man was allowed his humble &s;hare in the al|lotment, he would feel any di&s;po&s;ition to invade the portions of the ranks above him. Equality of condi|tion is impo&s;&s;ible. They, who talk of it to the people, mean nothing but to deceive them. The very act of ju&s;tice and good government, which &s;ecures to every man his re&s;pective right, excludes the idea of po&s;itive equality. The Roman &s;lave had &s;ome rights of per|&s;onal property, tho' he had no other. That example, however, is but little to my purpo&s;e compared to the condition of the Helots, under the tyranny of Sparta. My general wi&s;h and object is to make the &s;ervice of the Negroes, as much as po&s;&s;ible, a real &s;ervice, by at|taching it to the &s;oil, and as little as po&s;&s;ible a per&s;onal &s;ervice. The Negroes, in our i&s;lands, are equally &s;ubject to both, or may be capriciou&s;ly transferred from one to the other. The horrible barbarity, with which the <HI>Helots</HI> were treated, was the deliberate policy of the &s;tate, not the indulgence or re&s;ult of per&s;onal cruelty. The Spartans were far outnumbered by the Helots. The &s;ecurity of the few was thought to be incompatible with common ju&s;tice, or even with com|mon mercy, to the many. One crime produced an|other. The fir&s;t violation of right, in reducing a free people to &s;lavery, could only be &s;upported by a perpe|tual outrage to humanity. Such at lea&s;t was the prin|ciple and practice of that extraordinary government, in which every thing was original and unexampled. In another in&s;tance, directly applicable to my pre&s;ent
<PB N="44" REF="46">
purpo&s;e, they departed boldly from all the vulgar rules of human prudence; and yet they acted wi&s;ely. They renounced the u&s;es of property for them&s;elves, and in effect gave the lands of Laconia to the Helots, to be cultivated by them, on the &s;ole condition of re|turning to their ma&s;ters a fixed and certain tribute in kind, equivalent to a quit-rent, which could never be increa&s;ed. To every other intent of u&s;e and profit, the Helots were in fact proprietors of the lands. The amount of the demand on the produce of their la|bour being once made unalterable, a vigorous and general cultivation followed. Many years ago, I endeavoured to inculcate a &s;imilar principle on the Engli&s;h Government of Bengal. I &s;aid then, and I &s;ay now, leave the lands with the natural owners, the Zemindars, and fix your demand of a certain por|tion of the produce at once and for ever. Subject, as it is, to a foreign dominion, much heavier in detail than that of a &s;ingle de&s;pot, Bengal cannot exi&s;t, with &s;ecu|rity of any kind to the natives, or with permanent ad|vantage to the governing power, on any other princi|ple. The effective right of property was inviolable in the <HI>Helot,</HI> tho' &s;ubject, in his per&s;on, to a cruelty at once deliberate and capricious, and tho' his life was never &s;afe. He &s;till held a middle rank between the freeman and the dome&s;tic &s;lave. The Helots were commonly inrolled in the Spartan armies; and, tho' &s;eldom rewarded for their courage or fidelity, their condition was mended, at lea&s;t as long as the war la&s;ted. The life of a &s;oldier, with all its fatigues and dangers, is undoubtedly preferable to that of a &s;lave. We are told that the Negroes on our plantations are always ready to take up arms for their owners, and to
<PB N="45" REF="47">
fight in their defence; and this is advanced for a triumphant proof of their attachment, and con&s;equently of the mildne&s;s with which they are treated. In &s;ome ca&s;es, it may be &s;o. I have no wi&s;h or occa&s;ion to over&s;tate any thing to the di&s;advantage of the plan|ters. But, generally &s;peaking, the fact does not prove the propo&s;ition. All it proves, with any certainty, is, that in the army the Negroes are &s;ure of food and cloathing, and exempted from field labour and arbitrary puni&s;hment. How were the armies of Lewis the Fourteenth recruited in the late&s;t of his wars? The di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery of every other condition of life drove all men into the army, where alone it was po&s;&s;ible to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. How often have we been told that the wonderful facility, with which the French have been able to keep their forces complete in the pre&s;ent war, proves nothing but the general de&s;olation of the coun|try, and that all the bread, that exi&s;ted, was re&s;erved for the army. This example of the Helots, Sir, is direct and powerful to my immediate purpo&s;e. They were &s;laves, and they had landed property, or an equi|valent to it in the u&s;e and enjoyment. In our own ancient hi&s;tory, the fir&s;t e&s;tate or tenure, &s;uperior to downright &s;lavery, but inferior to every other condi|tion, was that of a <HI>Villan regardant,</HI> who&s;e &s;ervice was annexed to the manor or to the land, and who could not be &s;eparated from it. To a &s;tate re&s;embling this, I would, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, rai&s;e the Negro. The planters &s;hould be obliged to furni&s;h every adult Ne|gro, as they &s;ay they do at pre&s;ent, with a cottage and a &s;mall portion of land for his own u&s;e, with implements of tillage, and a fixed allowance of time for cultivation; the entire produce to be his own. In &s;ome of the
<PB N="46" REF="48">
I&s;lands, this allotment may be made with greater ea&s;e and convenience than in others. But no plantation &s;hould be &s;o over&s;tocked with Negroes, no more than a farm with cattle, as not to leave room enough for the production of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Ground food is the only nouri&s;hment, in which the Negroes have any plea&s;ure. The Hou&s;e will ob&s;erve that I mean to confine my|&s;elf to the general principles and outlines of a plan, the detail of which will appear before you more di&s;|tinctly in another form, if I &s;hould be permitted to proceed in the manner I propo&s;e. Marriage mu&s;t be encouraged; I mean a real bond of union between the &s;exes. A certain participation in the u&s;ufruct of the land, however limited and qualified, is the fir&s;t en|couragement to marry. The marriage mu&s;t be con|tracted with &s;ome ceremony, and recorded in &s;ome form; and then it mu&s;t be &s;eriou&s;ly protected. By the laws of &s;ome of the Grecian &s;tates, if a ma&s;ter violated the wife of his &s;lave, the hu&s;band and the wife were in&s;tantly free. <HI>Leges pudicitiae &s;unt juris naturalis.</HI> Di|rect force or violent compul&s;ion of any kind, employed again&s;t a Negre&s;s, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death. Corruption of the wife &s;hould make the hu&s;band free. It is &s;hocking to human nature to think that per&s;onal protection, even to this amount, would con&s;titute in it&s;elf a &s;tate of improvement. But, once granted and &s;ecured, it would of nece&s;&s;ity lead to greater. I know that, according to the actual laws of the I&s;lands, in which you will find that principles are for ever de|duced from practice, the difficulty of convicting a a white man of any crime again&s;t a Negro, is little le&s;s than in&s;urmountable. The Negroes are not &s;up|po&s;ed to be moral agents. Again&s;t a white man, no
<PB N="47" REF="49">
evidence of theirs is admitted. The laws, if they were good, cannot act for want of proof. The hand of the magi&s;trate, tho' di&s;po&s;ed to puni&s;h, is di&s;armed or &s;u&s;|pended. The mo&s;t &s;hocking acts of cruelty are encourag|ed by impunity; and, in the mid&s;t of horrible &s;ufferings, there is no complaint. By mending the po&s;itive exi&s;t|ence of the Negro, you will gradually rai&s;e him to a moral character, &s;ufficient at lea&s;t to make his evidence admi&s;&s;ible. Without it, he can have no protection from the laws. His credit and e&s;timation will grow with the intere&s;t you give him, and keep pace with the advantages, in which you &s;uffer him to participate. In no ca&s;e &s;hould the Negro be removed, again&s;t his will, from the &s;pot which he has cultivated, much le&s;s from the e&s;tate. They &s;hould always de&s;cend or be trans|ferred together. In no ca&s;e &s;hould wives be &s;eparated from their hu&s;bands, or children from their parents. In the&s;e in&s;titutions I lay my foundation. Particular re|gulations will follow in their place. There &s;hould be a general limitation by law of the hours of labour ac|cording to age and &s;ex. Indulgence to weakne&s;s or infirmity mu&s;t &s;till be left to the di&s;cretion and bene|volence of the ma&s;ter. Every Negro &s;hould have the privilege of applying the petty profits of his indu&s;try to the recovery of his freedom, by buying out the re|mainder of his &s;lavery, or &s;ome part of it, at a price to be fixed by law. Fathers and mothers, who have brought up a certain number of children, &s;hould be rewarded with premiums, and the mothers exempted from labour. No man &s;hould be deemed capable of the office of over&s;eer or manager of an e&s;tate, who was not of a certain age, and married. The &s;uperintendance of the female &s;laves would naturally devolve, as it
<PB N="48" REF="50">
ought, to the care of his wife. I need not paint the ca&s;es, in which the &s;ympathy of a woman and a mother would be a &s;ource of comfort and relief to the&s;e creatures. The &s;ufferings, appropriated to the &s;ex, demand the office, and allot the department. I am not, Sir, &s;o weak or inexperienced as to expect that, if laws were ever &s;o judiciou&s;ly framed to accompli&s;h all the&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es, they would execute them&s;elves, and e&s;pecially in the We&s;t India I&s;lands, without the con|currence of other e&s;tabli&s;hments. Undoubtedly there mu&s;t be &s;pecial courts, and magi&s;trates, and officers, to receive complaints, to pro&s;ecute, and to puni&s;h. There mu&s;t be a judge con&s;ervator of the Negroes in every i&s;land, with an advocate and attorney to plead and act for them, appointed by the King, and dependent &s;olely on the Crown, with &s;ufficient &s;alaries, and no way in|tere&s;ted in the property or produce of the plantations. Under the principal judge, and by his deputation, there &s;hould be itinerant in&s;pectors, with &s;ome of the powers of a ju&s;tice of peace, who &s;hould travel occa|&s;ionally, and not at &s;tated periods, in circuits thro' the I&s;lands, give notice of their arrival at convenient &s;ta|tions, and wait there a &s;ufficient time to receive com|plaints; in petty in&s;tances, to give redre&s;s; in graver ca&s;es, to in&s;titute a more &s;erious proceeding before the &s;uperior court. I have another mea&s;ure in contempla|tion, materially connected with the general object of relief, for which I am contending, tho' it be not to operate immediately in the I&s;lands. I know that, in the circum&s;tances to which I am compelled to &s;ubmit, it could not fail of producing many &s;alutary effects; and yet I cannot mention it without a deep &s;en&s;ation of regret. With or without it, the general plan might
<PB N="49" REF="51">
proceed. But, if the plan fails, the mea&s;ure I allude to is indi&s;pen&s;able. I &s;hall &s;ubmit it to the con&s;idera|tion of the Hou&s;e, as I received it from a gentleman, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a con&s;iderable property in Antigua, and with whom I have the happine&s;s to be united by per|&s;onal friend&s;hip as well as by alliance. As it is &s;till permitted to be the will of Parliament, that this in|fernal trade &s;hould continue, let us endeavour to mi|tigate, if we can, the horrors that belong to it. There ought to be commi&s;&s;ioners &s;tationed at the principal places of traffic on the coa&s;t of Africa, with &s;alaries &s;ufficient to engage men of character to accept the office, and with legal powers to examine the accommo|dation in the &s;hips, to &s;uperintend and regulate the purcha&s;e of Negroes, to act as magi&s;trates of the mar|ket, to prevent or put a &s;top to treacherous or fraudu|lent tran&s;actions, to &s;ee that iniquity and inju&s;tice are at lea&s;t conducted fairly, on their own pretended prin|ciples, and without unnece&s;&s;ary aggravations. Surely the &s;ub&s;tance of this traffic is enough of it&s;elf to &s;atisfy the mo&s;t &s;avage or brutal mind. Above all things, it &s;hould be the care and duty of &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners to prevent the &s;eparation of families&mdash;not to &s;uffer the wife to be divided from her hu&s;band, the &s;i&s;ter from the brother, the infant from its mother. The &s;ales in the I&s;lands &s;hould be governed by the &s;ame rules. A multi|tude of other duties and offices, with which the com|mi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be charged, will occur upon reflection. That a ca&s;e &s;hould exi&s;t, with the con&s;ent of an enlight|ened Government, in which &s;uch an in&s;titution &s;hould be wanted, is &s;hameful, is intolerable. I am &s;ure it is an opprobrium to the name of England. In the treat|ment of the Negroes in our i&s;lands, of all its evils the
<PB N="50" REF="52">
mo&s;t grievous and afflicting remains to be con&s;idered. As long as it exi&s;ts, I know that general in&s;titutions, laws, and magi&s;trates, will avail but little in their defence. The arbitrary power of the whip, committed to men without feeling, to be exerci&s;ed in anger, and unchecked even by the intere&s;t of an owner in the well|being of the object, is not in its nature capable of re|gulation, or &s;ubject to controul. To limit the num|ber of &s;tripes, to interpo&s;e between the naked helple&s;s wretch,&mdash;a pregnant woman perhaps,&mdash;and the up|lifted hand of the driver, would be an unju&s;t inva&s;ion of nece&s;&s;ary authority, and po&s;&s;ibly in its con&s;equences might hazard the crop. For a mi&s;chief of this kind there is no partial remedy. In the place of a de&s;potic power of puni&s;hment entru&s;ted to a &s;ingle per&s;on, I would &s;ub&s;titute a form of trial, not le&s;s effectual to in|&s;ure the rea&s;onable demand on labour, and equally &s;afe to the only intere&s;ts, which the planters &s;eem to think of. I would give juri&s;diction to the Negroes, in every plan|tation, over one another. The whole gang of males adult &s;hould con&s;titute the pannel, out of which a kind of jury &s;hould be formed by lot or by &s;election, with a right of challenge, on one &s;ide to the offender, and on the other to the ma&s;ter, or to his repre&s;entative, who &s;hould &s;uperintend and regulate the proceedings, and mitigate or remit the &s;entence, if he thought pro|per. Gentlemen, who are fond of ju&s;tice, may appre|hend, perhaps, that a black tribunal would rarely if ever inflict &s;ufficient puni&s;hment on a Negro. I, for my part, am confident that, as &s;oon as they under&s;tood their office; and were &s;en&s;ible of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, they would rather lean to &s;everity, and that the over&s;eer would often find him&s;elf obliged to re&s;train
<PB N="51" REF="53">
it. On this principle, the di&s;cipline of our armies in India is effectually maintained. An Honorable Gen|tleman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Smith.</NOTE> near me can give you better information on this &s;ubject. But I know enough of it to be able to a&s;&s;ure you that no Sepoy can be puni&s;hed but by the &s;entence of a court martial compo&s;ed of native officers, who have all been taken from the ranks, and with an European officer to act as judge advocate; and that I never heard the ju&s;tice of their proceedings di&s;puted. As long as they are tolerably well treated, they are attached to their officers, and will follow them as far as the be&s;t Briti&s;h troops. A remarkable in&s;tance of this attachment, and of their di&s;po&s;ition to do even more than ju&s;tice on offenders of their own ca&s;t, oc|curred a few years ago. Captain Ewans, an officer generally beloved, at the head of his battalion, was murdered by a Sepoy, who &s;uddenly went out of the ranks and &s;hot him, without notice or complaint, or any provocation that could ever be di&s;covered. The whole battalion &s;aw the fact. The grenadiers on the flanks immediately wheeled without orders, and &s;ur|rounded the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. The difficulty then was to pre|vent their tying him to a hor&s;e's tail, and dragging him to death without a trial. The Briti&s;h officers in&s;i&s;ted on his being regularly tried, and executed in the u&s;ual military form. I need not, however, have gone &s;o far from the I&s;lands for a &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;tance of practice founded on the &s;ame principle. I have not the honour of knowing the gentleman, who&s;e example I am going to appeal to; I mean Sir Philip Gibbs; but I know his character, and what
<PB N="52" REF="54">
his conduct has been in the management of his e&s;tate in Barbadoes. The former is eminently humane; the latter equally judicious. His virtues are to me a proof of his wi&s;dom. He gives his Negroes land and &s;tock, with time to cultivate. He feeds and cloaths them well. He encourages marriage among them, and allows of no puni&s;hment but by the &s;entence of a jury of Negroes. The con&s;equence is that his &s;laves do double the work of others, becau&s;e they are better able and more wil|ling. The in&s;tructions he has given to the managers of his e&s;tate are a model for imitation. The &s;ucce&s;s and the profit have corre&s;ponded with the benevolent de|&s;ign. Before I quit this fir&s;t divi&s;ion of my &s;ubject, I owe it in ju&s;tice to an honorable per&s;on, lately a di&s;|tingui&s;hed member of this Hou&s;e, as well as to my cau&s;e, not to conceal the lights I have received from him, and to avail my&s;elf, as far as I can, of the con|currence of his authority. On a &s;ubject of this nature there cannot, in my opinion, be a greater. I mean <HI>Mr. Burke.</HI> Divided, as we are, by an irreconcileable difference of opinion on another important &s;ubject, and &s;eparated in private life as long as that unfortunate que&s;tion continues, I &s;till hope and believe that the bond of per&s;onal friend&s;hip and good-will between us will never be di&s;&s;olved. As &s;oon as I had determined to take an active part in this bu&s;ine&s;s, I went to <HI>Mr. Burke,</HI> as wi&s;er men have done before me, for advice and information. I know how little I am qualified to occupy his &s;tation on any &s;ubject, and that I have undertaken a ta&s;k, which eminently and pe|culiarly belonged to him. To form and to dige&s;t a complete and perfect code of laws, on a &s;ubject &s;o ex|ten&s;ive and &s;o full of difficulties, would be a work ap|propriated
<PB N="53" REF="55" MS="y">
to the powers and compa&s;s of his mind. <HI>His</HI> indu&s;try and per&s;everance alone could carry it into exe|cution. On a tran&s;cendent que&s;tion, &s;uch as this, of morals implicated with policy, the eminence of his mind extends his view, and gives him an horizon, which vulgar vi&s;ion can reach to. I have not &s;trength to &s;u&s;tain or vigour to wield the armour of Achilles. If Mr. Burke were here,&mdash;for his own happine&s;s I can|not wi&s;h it,&mdash;this would be his office. How gladly would I re&s;ign it to him!</P>
<P><Q>Non foret incertus tanti certaminis haeres.</Q> </P>
<P>I have not &s;een the plan which he drew up &s;ome years ago, and which he then communicated to a Right Honorable Gentleman, high in office in Ireland;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pelham.</NOTE> and &s;ince to a Right Honorable Friend on the other &s;ide <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Windham.</NOTE>. Nor would I avail my&s;elf now of his permi&s;|&s;ion to &s;ee it, becau&s;e I &s;oon perceived that it went to an extent and embraced a multitude of objects, which I knew it was impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>me</HI> to manage. To force them on my mind, without capacity to receive them, would be only to embarra&s;s or utterly to di&s;courage me. Perhaps, too, I might differ from him on the mo&s;t prudential cour&s;e of proceeding. Yon will not &s;u&s;pect me of &s;etting my judgment in competition with his. If it were po&s;&s;ible for him to lead the cau&s;e him|&s;elf, I &s;hould hold my&s;elf ready for any &s;ubordinate part in it, and to be guided by his judgment. But, if I am to act, I mu&s;t act upon my own. I am not tho|roughly
<PB N="54" REF="56">
convinced of the advantage of forcing a great variety of in&s;titutions to march together and in front. Or po&s;&s;ibly it would be more hone&s;t to &s;ay, that I con&s;ult my own infirmity in leaving as much as I can to the gradual operation of tho&s;e &s;imple principles and limited in&s;titutions, which I am more able to com|prehend, to arrange with effect, and apply to practice.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, Sir, is now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the general object and principles of the plan, which I meant to lay before you. There are &s;ome per&s;ons undoubtedly, who&s;e hearty concurrence I am not &s;anguine enough to expect; but I do not believe it po&s;&s;ible that any man will directly and openly a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch an object, if it were attainable, is not to be de&s;ired;&mdash;that &s;uch a plan, if it were practicable, is not fit to be encouraged. No human re&s;olution will go that length. I know, as well as they do, on what ground they are prepared to meet me, and for what que&s;tion the &s;trength of their oppo&s;ition is re&s;erved. Admitting the mea&s;ure to be eligible in it&s;elf, they a&s;k me now by what means do you propo&s;e to carry it into execution? What cour&s;e would you pur&s;ue? What power would you employ? I &s;hall not keep the&s;e Gentlemen in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. My an&s;wer, I &s;ee, is waited for with an impatience, which indicates the certainty and anticipates the triumph of immediate victory. They exult in the practical diffi|culties in&s;eparable from every attempt to do good in this world, and which, they tru&s;t, are in&s;urmountable in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. Well, Sir, I am ready to gratify their de&s;ire, and prepared, as I think, for all the objections that can be rationally urged again&s;t me. This part of the que&s;tion is not new to me. What I
<PB N="55" REF="57">
know of it is derived not only from &s;tudy and re|flection, as deep as I am capable of giving to any &s;ubject, but from the wi&s;dom of great men whom I have known, and from the experience of events which have happened in my own time. Tho' too young to take part, I was old enough to ob&s;erve, and I had acce&s;s to &s;ome of the greate&s;t &s;ources of in&s;truc|tion. How far I may have been able to avail my&s;elf of the&s;e advantages mu&s;t be determined by others. The power, which I mean to re&s;ort to, for carrying this plan into effect, is that of the Briti&s;h Parliament over the colonies of Great Britain. No man is fairly at i&s;&s;ue with me, who does not di&s;tinctly deny that power. Is there a &s;tate&s;man in this Hou&s;e, is there an indi|vidual of any rank or con&s;ideration here, who will take it upon him&s;elf, directly and plainly, to maintain that denial, or, in other words, to affirm, that in no ca&s;e whatever has the Briti&s;h Parliament a right to make laws to bind the Briti&s;h colonies? I cannot believe it. But, if there be, let him come forward and declare him&s;elf. On that que&s;tion, incon&s;iderable as I am, and bold as it may appear, I am ready to meet him in front, to &s;hew that he knows nothing of the principles of legi&s;lation, of the policy of &s;tates, or of the duties of government, and to make him, for his ignorance at lea&s;t, the &s;corn and contempt of mankind. If he admits that ca&s;es may po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, in which the power may be nece&s;&s;ary, and the right undi&s;puted, I then &s;hall have nothing to prove, but that this is eminently a ca&s;e in point, in which the application of the unque&s;tion|able power of Parliament mu&s;t be re&s;orted to, becau&s;e no other power on earth is equal to the purpo&s;e. I am as ready as any man to allow, or to contend, if it were
<PB N="56" REF="58">
nece&s;&s;ary, that the tran&s;cendent power of Parliament to make laws for every part of the Briti&s;h empire, where it has not been formally relinqui&s;hed, is not, in prudence, to be u&s;ed on ordinary occa&s;ions, when the &s;ubordinate powers of legi&s;lation can act with equal effect in their &s;everal departments. It is a right re|&s;erved for great emergencies. To &s;ay that it ought to be &s;o re&s;erved, is to acknowledge that it exi&s;ts. Without evident nece&s;&s;ity, I would neither urge the ca&s;e nor agitate the right. Occa&s;ions vary, and pru|dence mu&s;t be con&s;ulted. But rights are not given to lie dormant for ever. They have relative duties at|tached to them. According to the occa&s;ion, the right is to be exerci&s;ed, and the duty to be performed. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity alone, if the thing mu&s;t be done, and if there be no alternative, conveys a right, or &s;tands in the place of it, to act for the general welfare or for the public &s;afety. I &s;hall &s;hew you hereafter how little is to be expected, on this &s;ubject, from the power, even if it concurred with the di&s;po&s;ition of the colonial a&s;&s;emblies, and that, by <HI>their</HI> means, a real and effective alteration in the condition of the Negroes can never be accom|pli&s;hed. But I have fir&s;t another argument to main|tain, and better ground to &s;tand on. In a former de|bate, the example of America was held out to deter us from acts, which might alienate the We&s;t India I&s;lands, and drive them to look el&s;ewhere for protection, if not to re&s;i&s;tance. At that time, nothing was in que&s;|tion but the abolition of the Slave Trade. This night you may be &s;ure of hearing the &s;ame argument repeated, or rather of &s;eeing the &s;ame weapon up|lifted to awe your deliberations. Let the que&s;tion be what it may, they are equally ready with it. If the
<PB N="57" REF="59">
We&s;t India I&s;lands would not &s;ubmit to abolition, how will they endure the interpo&s;ition of the legi&s;la|ture in any thing that touches their internal govern|ment? Such is the language of Engli&s;hmen, &s;itting among us, to the legi&s;lative authority of their country. Let us &s;ee with what rea&s;on they re&s;ort to the example of America. I am as ready to appeal to it as they are. I know where that fatal que&s;tion originated. No part of the argument, which divided this country on the merits of the Stamp Act, or of the events, which fol|lowed it, have e&s;caped me. With all tho&s;e tran&s;ac|tions in my view, I declare now, on the principles and in the language of Lord Chatham, that I REJOICE THAT AMERICA RESISTED. If this be a conce&s;&s;ion, the&s;e Gentlemen are welcome to it. I do not believe it will avail them. I rejoice that America re&s;i&s;ted with &s;ucce&s;s, becau&s;e it was a triumph of unque&s;tion|able right over outrageous wrong, of courage and vir|tue over tyranny and force;&mdash;becau&s;e the i&s;&s;ue of that conte&s;t has provided a refuge and left us an a&s;ylum, when exi&s;tence in Europe, perhaps even in England, can no longer be endured. The nations, cru&s;hed by taxes for the &s;upport of powers that oppre&s;s, or of wars that de&s;troy them, have &s;till the con&s;olation of knowing that peace, and freedom, and plenty, are to be found in America, and that there is &s;till a coun|try in the world, where every man enjoys in &s;ecu|rity the fruits of his indu&s;try, and the produce of his labour. Who is there, who can pronounce with certainty that a period is not approaching, when no other refuge may be left us?&mdash;On what ground did the Americans fir&s;t di&s;pute the general legi&s;lative au|thority of the mother country? Did they a&s;&s;ert that a
<PB N="58" REF="60">
Briti&s;h Parliament had no right to bind or to regulate a Briti&s;h colony by its laws, <HI>in any ca&s;e what&s;oever?</HI> Did they ever maintain a propo&s;ition &s;o ab&s;urd and &s;o mon&s;trous as that protection gave no claim to obe|dience, that tho&s;e duties were not reciprocal; that a nation <HI>&s;ub tutel&acirc;</HI> owed no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the tutelary power by which it was protected, that the ward owed nothing to the guardian, the pupil to the tutor, the child to the parent;&mdash;that &s;uch offices were merely nominal, and gave no right to act even for the benefit of the pretended objects of their care? No, Sir; Ame|rica had too much wi&s;dom for her&s;elf, as well as too hearty an attachment to England, to hold &s;uch fooli&s;h language, or to maintain &s;uch dangerous doctrines. See how &s;he has lately acted to &s;ome refractory de|pendencies of her own. The moment &s;uch principles prevail, there is an end of all unity of government in the world. In an extended empire, every di&s;tant pro|vince may &s;et up for it&s;elf. Every one of your i&s;lands may be an independent &s;tate. If I aimed at their de&s;truction, they &s;hould have <HI>my</HI> con&s;ent to be &s;o. You would &s;oon &s;ee them at your feet with &s;upplica|tion to you to re&s;ume your &s;tation, and never to re|linqui&s;h your authority over them. That authority was not di&s;puted by America, until it was extended to purpo&s;es unconnected with general regulation, and exerci&s;ed on principles, which, if once they were ad|mitted, left no &s;ecurity to the Americans for any thing they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The claim, which they re&s;i&s;ted, was that of direct taxation by a Hou&s;e of Commons, in which they were not repre&s;ented. They a&s;&s;erted truly, that taxation and repre&s;entation were in&s;eparable;&mdash; that the right grew from the fact, and could not exi&s;t
<PB N="59" REF="61">
without it. In private life, the guardian regulates the conduct, and even di&s;po&s;es of the property of the pupil, for his maintenance, for his &s;ervice, or for his educa|tion. But it does not follow, that he may take any part of it for his own u&s;e or benefit. The fir&s;t may be a duty; the &s;econd would be a robbery. The protect|ing power has a claim to obedience, not to money. To prevent any further que&s;tion on this &s;ubject, all claim to lay taxes on the colonies was formally re|nounced in the year 1778. The act of the 18th of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, commonly called <HI>Governor John&s;tone</HI>'s act, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"declares and enacts, that the King and Parlia|ment of Great Britain will not impo&s;e any duty, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment what&s;oever, payable in the colo|nies, except &s;uch duties as it may be expedient to impo&s;e for the regulations of commerce, the nett produce of &s;uch duties to be always paid and applied to the u&s;e of &s;uch colonies."</Q>&mdash;This &s;urrender, on the part of Great Britain, is &s;pecific. All the other general rights of the mother country remain unaltered. The conce&s;&s;ion, by which one particular point is given up, amounts in fact to a re-affirmance of the re&s;t. The que&s;tion then is, whether the mea&s;ure I propo&s;e, and particularly that part of it, by which the planters would be obliged to allot &s;ome portion of their land with a cottage to their Negroes, be or be not an act of taxa|tion. I de&s;ire to confine my&s;elf to this point at pre|&s;ent, becau&s;e I do not mean to in&s;i&s;t that a provi&s;ion for the &s;alaries and e&s;tabli&s;hments of magi&s;trates, ad|vocates, and commi&s;&s;ioners may not properly be the &s;ubject of a different con&s;ideration. What I am now &s;peaking of is the allotment of a &s;hare in the u&s;ufruct of the e&s;tate to the &s;ervice and benefit of the e&s;tate
<PB N="60" REF="62">
it&s;elf, and to no other purpo&s;e what&s;oever. Nothing is taken away from the owner, nothing is applied to the u&s;es of Government. The tenure of the <HI>villan re|gardant</HI> was in its nature u&s;ufructuary, and was never under&s;tood to limit or impair the right of the proprietor to the property of the &s;oil. Now I affirm that it is e&s;|&s;ential to the character and definition of a tax, that the amount &s;hall be taken from the contributor and applied to the &s;ervice of the Crown or of the public. To appropriate and allot an exi&s;ting fund, whether in land or money, is not of it&s;elf an act of taxation. But if it were &s;o, what pretence have the&s;e gentlemen to appeal to the ca&s;e or to quote the rights, which ju&s;tified the re&s;i&s;tance of America? Is there any re|&s;emblance between the two &s;ituations? The Ame|ricans re&s;i&s;ted taxation, becau&s;e they were not re|pre&s;ented in Parliament. The folly and inju&s;tice of this country, by per&s;i&s;ting in a claim of right, which never could have been e&s;&s;entially exerci&s;ed, and which at la&s;t was relinqui&s;hed, drove the Americans to the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;erting much more than their original preten&s;ions amounted to. They began with petition and remon&s;trance;&mdash;they appealed to the &s;word, and e&s;tabli&s;hed their de&s;tined independence long be|fore its natural and inevitable period, before they them&s;elves had fore&s;een or de&s;ired it. In the full|ne&s;s of time, and in the maturity of their &s;tate, &s;epa|ration and independence mu&s;t have been the lot of America. The Herculean infant would nece&s;&s;arily have bur&s;t its cradle, and broken loo&s;e from its leading &s;trings. But then the union of the two countries would have continued unimpaired. The mutual rela|tions of kindne&s;s and friend&s;hip would not have been
<PB N="61" REF="63">
di&s;&s;olved. Affection and attachment would have oc|cupied the places of authority and dependence. Be|tween the ca&s;e of America and that of the We&s;t India I&s;lands there is no &s;imilarity, nor are the &s;ame con&s;e|quences po&s;&s;ible. Is it true, in fact, that the property of the We&s;t India I&s;lands is not repre&s;ented in the Hou&s;e of Commons? Of what &s;ort of per&s;ons does that party con&s;i&s;t, which, on the &s;ubject of the Slave Trade, carries every thing before it in this Hou&s;e? Why, Sir, it is one of their allegations, when it &s;uits their pur|po&s;e, that the property of the I&s;lands is ve&s;ted in Great Britain, that is, in the hands of re&s;ident owners, mort|gagees, merchants, and creditors. They are all on the &s;pot, to repre&s;ent the intere&s;ts, and to defend the right of the I&s;lands. <HI>They,</HI> at lea&s;t, are the &s;ubjects of Great Britain. They, at lea&s;t, may be compelled by the power of Parliament. If they are not your &s;ubjects, what are they? The Americans, on the contrary, re|&s;ided on their own continent, at a di&s;tance, which made communication impracticable, and not only without repre&s;entation, but not even in contact, and much le&s;s in &s;ympathy with the power, that pretended to tax them. The progre&s;s of their population had no limits. An unbounded territory expanded to receive it. The I&s;lands have their boundary fixed for them by nature. The number of their white inhabitants cannot increa&s;e beyond a certain point, and mu&s;t always be incon&s;iderable in compari&s;on with the Negroes and people of colour. Of &s;ome &s;uperior power, of &s;ome protecting dominion, the I&s;lands mu&s;t for ever be the colonies or the dependencies. In the nature of things they never can he independent &s;tates. Their Repre|&s;entatives in this Hou&s;e talk boldly of &s;eparation, and
<PB N="62" REF="64">
even intimate re&s;i&s;tance. I would not drive them to that i&s;&s;ue. If they can make out their right, I would never put them to a trial of their &s;trength. Their ar|guments and their power are pretty much upon a footing. They know that, if they were unconnected with us to-morrow, and if it were po&s;&s;ible for them to maintain their independence again&s;t France and America, the great market for their produce is in the con&s;umption of the&s;e kingdoms, and that to this market they mu&s;t bring it on any terms, which Parliament &s;hould think fit to pre&s;cribe to them.</P>
<P>I have already intimated, that it is not my in|tention to propo&s;e any thing, that &s;hould really trench on the que&s;tion of taxation, or furni&s;h a pre|tence to cavil or to quarrel with the general views and purpo&s;es of the mea&s;ure. I need not argue about privileges, which I have no thoughts of invading. If the &s;ums required to pay the &s;alaries and to &s;up|port the e&s;tabli&s;hments, made nece&s;&s;ary by this or any other plan, were to be rai&s;ed in the I&s;lands by the direct authority of Parliament, the objection would then be in its place, and proper to be con&s;idered. That point is not in que&s;tion, and need not be debated. If the colonial a&s;&s;emblies cannot be prevailed upon, by a recommendation from the Crown, or any other means, to provide for &s;uch expences, the charge mu&s;t be borne by Great Britain, and may ea&s;ily be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon objects, unque&s;tionably within the di&s;po&s;ition of Par|liament. I am ready, for my part, to contribute to it, by a perpetual rent-charge on my e&s;tate, to a greater amount than can be rea&s;onably &s;tated as the ju&s;t pro|portion of any individual.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65">Waving now, Sir, all farther con&s;ideration of the &s;trict right of Parliament to act legi&s;latively for the general benefit of the We&s;t India I&s;lands, I know there is another important que&s;tion to be re&s;olved. Since the different I&s;lands have colonial a&s;&s;emblies or inferior Parliaments of their own, why do I not prefer &s;ome cour&s;e of application to tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, and try whe|ther all the u&s;eful purpo&s;es of the Bill, which I am endeavouring to recommend to the Hou&s;e of Commons, may not equally be effected thro' that medium? The que&s;tion is fair, and I &s;hall an&s;wer it frankly. In the face of experience, and again&s;t all our knowledge and ob&s;ervation of the principles, character, and pro|ceedings of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, let us &s;uppo&s;e for a mo|ment that a general di&s;po&s;ition did really prevail among them to impart to their Negroes &s;ome &s;hare in the natural rights of human creatures, labouring in their &s;ervice, and a legal &s;ecurity for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. Within the&s;e few years, &s;ince que&s;tions on this &s;ubject have been warmly revived and repeatedly agitated in England, they have had opportunities and incitements enough to indulge their benevolence, and to take the bu&s;ine&s;s into their own hands. But neither have they di&s;covered &s;uch an inclination, nor do I think it was in their power to have concerted a general plan, or to have pur&s;ued it with effect. Partial alterations might po&s;&s;ibly have been attempted in the &s;everal I&s;lands, without &s;y&s;tem or connection, according to the acci|dental temper or prevailing di&s;cretion of the different a&s;&s;emblies. Some would have granted le&s;s than others. Very little, I believe, would have been yielded by any of them. But, were it otherwi&s;e in point of di&s;|po&s;ition, their number and their di&s;tance from each other would have made it impo&s;&s;ible for them to deli|berate
<PB N="64" REF="66">
in concert, or finally to concur in a uniform conclu&s;ion. The colonies of North American were in contact with each other, and were capable of act|ing under one direction, for a general object. The I&s;lands have no union of views, no common bond of intere&s;t, to engage them to agree in a general re&s;olu|tion; much le&s;s have they a union of power to inforce it. So much the more nece&s;&s;ary is it, that there &s;hould be &s;omewhere a &s;uperior indifferent tribunal, and a binding power paramount to them all. No authority, adequate to the purpo&s;e, can exi&s;t but in Parliament. If one of the provincial legi&s;latures pre&s;ided with &s;o|vereignty over the re&s;t, it might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ufficient to form the plan. The difficulties of the execution would &s;till be in&s;urmountable. But let their capacity be what it may, the principal di&s;qualification lies in their rooted aver&s;ion to the mea&s;ure, and in their con|tempt of the objects of it. Such is the invariable in|fluence of arbitrary capricious power, to vitiate the human mind;&mdash;to make us hate, when we have in|jured; and de&s;pi&s;e, when we have degraded. A great deal, it is &s;aid, may be expected from the virtue and prudence of the colonial a&s;&s;emblies. Let us try the value of that expectation by the te&s;t of experience. To judge of what they will do, let us &s;ee what they have done. I place no confidence in profe&s;|&s;ions, un&s;upported by conduct. I have examined their laws with care and attention. I have read them with patience, with wearine&s;s, and di&s;gu&s;t. I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, it is not ea&s;y for an Engli&s;h mind to conceive that &s;uch a code as this could be the re&s;ult of debate and deliberation in a &s;enate of any &s;ort. Their utter ignorance of every rational principle of
<PB N="65" REF="67">
legi&s;lation is only to be paralleled by the unfeeling cruelty that dictates and prevails thro' all their re&s;olu|tions. I &s;hall not weary the Hou&s;e with details or recitals from this book. My honorable Friend <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William Smith, E&s;q.</NOTE> near me has kindly undertaken that ta&s;k, if the Hou&s;e &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to call for it. I believe it will be &s;ufficient, if I give you a &s;ample of the principles, on which the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies have proceeded. You may take it &s;afely for a &s;pecimen of the whole. Fir&s;t of all, let the per&s;onal injury done to a Negro, be ever &s;o atro|cious, the a&s;&s;emblies have taken &s;pecial care to make con|viction impo&s;&s;ible. Suppo&s;e that all the Negroes on any plantation &s;hould jointly and &s;everally atte&s;t that the over&s;eer had <HI>maimed, defaced, mutilated, or cruelly tor|tured a Negro,</HI> (the common language of the&s;e laws) their evidence would avail nothing. The party would be at liberty to purge him&s;elf on his oath; that is, they have e&s;tabli&s;hed impunity by law for crimes, in many ca&s;es wor&s;e than murder. They talk of con|viction perpetually, and of penalties to be attached to it. To deface, to maim, or to mutilate, if by any means the fact can be proved, is to be puni&s;hed with impri&s;onment, not exceeding three months, and a fine of a hundred pounds currency, <HI>to be paid into the trea|&s;ury of the i&s;land for the public u&s;es thereof.</HI> But in what form, or by what te&s;timony conviction is to be ob|tained in this or any other in&s;tance again&s;t a white man, where there is no white evidence, which mu&s;t generally be the ca&s;e, is no where &s;pecified.

one another. They have a fellow feeling on this &s;ubject, or they can ea&s;ily take care not to act in com|pany. An act, pa&s;&s;ed in Dominica in the year 1788, <HI>for the encouragement, protection, and better government of &s;laves,</HI> I am told, is greatly relied on as a proof of the ju&s;tice and humanity which prevail in the I&s;lands. This act does certainly admit, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is ju&s;t and proper that the &s;laves &s;hould be protected in their per|&s;ons from the violence and inhumanity of &s;uch white per&s;ons and free per&s;ons of colour, <HI>who may have no lawful authority over them.</HI>"</Q> The admi&s;&s;ion is impor|tant. Ob&s;erve the date, and then con&s;ider what &s;ort and what length of antecedent practice is proved by it. But this act is remedial. I wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;ible to bring the whole tenor of it into your view. One example will be enough to &s;hew you the &s;pirit that runs thro' it. The 18th clau&s;e declares <HI>that the inferior crimes of &s;laves cannot always be conveniently brought before the cognizance of the magi&s;trates,</HI> and therefore enacts, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that every &s;lave, who &s;hall di&s;obey orders, or who &s;hall be guilty of neglect of duty, or ab&s;ence from labour, &amp;c. &amp;c. &s;hall be puni&s;hed <HI>at the di&s;cretion</HI> of the owner, renter, manager, or over&s;eer, by confine|ment or flogging on the bare back, provided the number of la&s;hes does not exceed thirty-nine."</Q> Trial and conviction are avowedly out of the que&s;tion.

is not provided for. Mo&s;t of the&s;e lawgivers &s;eem to think it rea&s;onable that, if any violent injury be done to the per&s;on of a Negro, compen&s;ation &s;hould be made for it. By an act of St. Vincent's, pa&s;t in 1767, it is provided that, if any white per&s;on &s;hall ca&s;trate or di&s;member any &s;lave (familiar ca&s;es) he &s;hall, <HI>upon con|viction,</HI> and if <HI>the pro&s;ecution be commenced in one year after the offence, pay double damages and co&s;ts to the party grieved.</HI> By the 47th clau&s;e, if a &s;lave, in pur&s;uit of a runaway, <HI>&s;hall be only maimed or much hurt, proportionable allow|ance &s;hall be made by the public.</HI> Now who do you under&s;tand to be the party aggrieved, to whom &s;ome compen&s;ation and allowance ought to be made?&mdash;The maimed or mutilated Negro? No, Sir. In the eye of the law, the owner is the only &s;ufferer. He &s;uffers in his property. He lo&s;es the labour of his &s;lave. If <HI>He</HI> be reimbur&s;ed, the ju&s;tice of the i&s;land is &s;atisfied. By a law of the Bahama I&s;lands, pa&s;&s;ed in 1784, it is enacted that any per&s;on, who &s;hall apprehend a run|away Negro, <HI>dead or alive,</HI> &s;hall be paid twenty pounds. Then comes the trial of the runaway, before two magi|&s;trates and three freeholders, who, on conviction &s;hall order execution, unle&s;s it &s;hall appear to them <HI>that &s;uch &s;lave has received &s;uch cruel u&s;age from his or her owner, as to have been the cau&s;e of his or her running away.</HI> Ob|serve that the reward is given for taking <HI>dead</HI> as well as alive; that is, for &s;hooting a &s;lave, who might have been driven to run away by that <HI>cruel u&s;age,</HI> which, they &s;ay, would &s;ave him from puni&s;hment if he had been taken alive.

<P><PB N="68" REF="70">In other i&s;lands, the proof of innocence, or freedom is always put upon the accu&s;ed Negro.

<P>I a&s;k pardon of the Hou&s;e for dwelling &s;o long, on &s;uch odious examples of deliberate legi&s;lative barbarity. It was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;hew you what &s;ort of legi&s;lators you are referred to; into what hands you are to delegate your ju&s;tice and your mercy, and how fit they are to be tru&s;ted. To e&s;tabli&s;h the nece&s;&s;ity of a direct recour&s;e to the power of Parliament and the inju&s;tice of re&s;orting to any other, one general con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject remains to be &s;tated, and with that I &s;hall conclude. The population of the i&s;lands con&s;i&s;ts of the many, who are black, and of a few who are white. The few legi&s;late for the many, without their con&s;ent or knowledge. The Negroes, I take it, are not repre|&s;ented in the a&s;&s;emblies, who&s;e authority, however, would not have been di&s;puted, if it had been exerci&s;ed with any tolerable regard to ju&s;tice, rea&s;on, or hu|manity. The nature of the ca&s;e requires that there &s;hould be &s;omewhere a compul&s;ory power over both parties. The highe&s;t attribute of Parliament is to com|pel

the guilty and to protect the innocent. The &s;ta|tion and the tru&s;t are in&s;eparable. Renounce your of|fice, or perform your duty.</P>
<P>With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a near relation, who&s;e &s;tudies I hope will be &s;ucce&s;sful as long as they are directed by generous principles to honourable ends, a bill for the purpo&s;es, which I have &s;ubmitted to the Hou&s;e, is in &s;ome degree of forwardne&s;s. I am glad I did not fore|&s;ee the uncommon difficulties that belong to it, and the extent of the labour I was about to undertake. I fear it would have deterred me from attempting to do any thing. Suppo&s;ing I were at liberty to proceed as I thought fit, my de&s;ire would be to have leave to bring in the Bill, to read it once, to have it printed, and to let it lie over till the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion. Even they, who might wi&s;h to promote the objects of the bill by other means, would find &s;ome advantage, I hope, from having the bill before them. They might take the materials, and make a better u&s;e of them. Though I &s;hould not have a &s;eat in Parliament, I &s;hall be ready to devote my time and my labour to a&s;&s;i&s;t any man, who will un|dertake to pro&s;ecute the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>With this act I am content to clo&s;e my parlia|mentary life. I &s;et out with a fixed principle, and have adhered to it faithfully, without looking to the right or left for advantages. I am not con&s;cious of having pur&s;ued any intere&s;t at the expence of any duty. I &s;aw my way, and I knew where it would lead me. For profit or preferment I &s;hould have taken another cour&s;e. For honour and happine&s;s I &s;hall not think that I have lived in vain, if, at the period of my
<PB N="70" REF="72">
exi&s;tence, I &s;hould be able to look back, as I do in this place, to a life of unrewarded &s;ervice, and to end it with an act of benevolence to mankind.</P>
<P>I move you, Sir, that leave be given to bring in a Bill for the better regulation and improvement of the &s;itua|tion of the Negroes and other &s;laves in the colonies, i&s;lands, and plantations in America and the We&s;t Indies, belonging to his Maje&s;ty, his heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT affords &s;ome &s;atisfaction to the friends of humanity to ob&s;erve that, notwith&s;tanding the recent rejec|tion of the Bill for aboli&s;hing the African Trader, the &s;ubject is not yet wholly abandoned; but that, on the contrary, it will be revived in a manner much more likely than heretofore to in&s;ure eventual &s;ucce&s;s. The little attention that has been paid to conciliate the good will, or to allay the fears of tho&s;e, who were mo&s;t inte|re&s;ted in the event, were but too &s;ure indications either that the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed was not intended to be car|ried, or that the promoters of it, however &s;incere in their intentions, were &s;trangely ignorant of the means likely to effect their purpo&s;e. Is it po&s;&s;ible that man|kind are yet to learn that the happine&s;s or advantage of any one cla&s;s of &s;ociety can never depend on the mi&s;ery or misfortunes of another? It is by uniting the real intere&s;ts of different cla&s;&s;es of men in one mea&s;ure, and not by placing them in oppo&s;ition to each other, that any permanent reform is rea&s;onably to be ex|pected.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">In attempting to engage the Briti&s;h Parliament in meliorating the condition of the &s;laves in the We&s;t In|dia I&s;lands, you will, perhaps, incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of tho&s;e, who, in the high language of unbending virtue, di&s;dain to regulate oppre&s;&s;ion, or compromi&s;e with guilt; but the &s;edate ob&s;erver of human nature will &s;ee that violent changes in the moral world are not le&s;s dangerous than tho&s;e of the natural, and that al|though a &s;torm or an earthquake may at times purify the atmo&s;phere, yet that this change is much more de|&s;irable when effected by a le&s;s violent operation. Hu|man misfortunes and human crimes require human re|medies; and that fa&s;tidious delicacy, which cannot bear the loath&s;omene&s;s of an ho&s;pital, or the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a jail, is not likely ever to render any important &s;er|vices to mankind.</P>
<P>From the We&s;t India Planters you will probably meet with a more formidable oppo&s;ition; and it is not unlikely that they may oppo&s;e you in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, by contending that, as each of the i&s;lands has a legi&s;lative body of its own, they are exclu&s;ively competent to judge of &s;uch regulations as are nece&s;&s;ary for their internal &s;afety and advantage, and that the interference of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature in making laws, which do not affect them&s;elves, but affect a different body of men, with different &s;entiments, and different intere&s;ts, is prepo&s;terous and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>This objection would certainly be well founded, were all the inhabitants of the We&s;t India I&s;lands in &s;uch a &s;tate of information and equality as to concur in mak|ing laws for them&s;elves, and to bring out in re&s;ult a
<PB N="73" REF="75">
general opinion. But the fact is not &s;o. The&s;e i&s;lands are inhabited by two bodies of men, the great majority of whom are in a &s;tate of &s;lavery to the re&s;t. In claiming therefore the right of making laws for the&s;e &s;ubordinate cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, the planters arrogate to them&s;elves the very privilege, which they contend to be tyrannical and unju&s;t, viz. the right of making laws, by which others are governed without their own con|&s;ent. Whil&s;t the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es of men exi&s;t, the in|terference of the Briti&s;h Government is rendered ne|ce&s;&s;ary by that very circum&s;tance. Whil&s;t the&s;e i&s;lands remain a part of the Briti&s;h dominions, it is not only the right but the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of that government to watch over the intere&s;ts of the humble&s;t cla&s;&s;es of the community, and not to con&s;ign over the happine&s;s and exi&s;tence of thou&s;ands to the pa&s;&s;ions or the pre|judices of tho&s;e, who, blinded by mi&s;taken ideas of their own intere&s;t, and too often depraved by long habits of &s;uperiority, are generally the lea&s;t qualified to judge even where the que&s;tion relates to their own ad|vantage. The re&s;ult of the &s;lave carrying bill, the good effects of which are now generally acknowledged, has however afforded one u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to the &s;uppor|ters of African &s;lavery; and I hope the regulations, which you purpo&s;e to introduce, will ere long afford them another.</P>
<P>It may be &s;tated as an incontrovertible maxim, that whenever any portion of the human race are placed in a fair and rea&s;onable &s;ituation, and &s;upplied with the nece&s;&s;ary articles of life, they will continue to increa&s;e their &s;pecies. Had this not been the fact the human race would long ago have been extinct, nor has it ever
<PB N="74" REF="76">
been pretended that the natives of Africa are le&s;s pro|lific than tho&s;e of any other quarter of the earth. To what cau&s;e is it then to be attributed that, after a con&s;tant &s;upply for upwards of two centuries, the pre|&s;ent Negro inhabitants of the Briti&s;h We&s;t Indies bear &s;o &s;mall a proportion to the number from time to time actually imported? or whence ari&s;es this continual wa&s;te of life, which is the foundation of the African Trade? Certainly <HI>becau&s;e they are not in a fair and rea|&s;onable &s;ituation,</HI> and have not tho&s;e advantages, which are nece&s;&s;ary to enable them to fulfill even the fir&s;t law of their exi&s;tence. To improve that &s;ituation&mdash; To admit them, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, to the rank of human beings&mdash;To give them a &s;tation, and a known place in &s;ociety, however low that place may be, is the immediate object and duty of that government on whom, and on whom only, they have claims for pro|tection. As their numbers increa&s;e, as their moral powers improve, they will make further advances in the &s;cale of civilization; their progre&s;s will be from &s;laves to va&s;&s;als attached to the land, from va&s;&s;als to hu&s;bandmen, and from hu&s;bandmen &s;ome may, perhaps, ri&s;e by their own merits to a higher cla&s;s, and form a &s;ort of yeomanry of the Briti&s;h plantations. The ne|ce&s;&s;ary power for cultivating the&s;e plantations will then he obtained on the &s;pot. The example, if advan|tageous, will be followed by other nations, and the trade for &s;laves to Africa will be aboli&s;hed without a &s;truggle, not as unju&s;t, but as unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>That the parent &s;tate, and not the local legi&s;lature, is properly charged with the performance of this duty,
<PB N="75" REF="77">
is evident from the fir&s;t mea&s;ure, which it appears ne|ce&s;&s;ary to adopt. The planters, when called upon by the Briti&s;h nation to mitigate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their &s;laves, have replied by their able advocate Mr. Bryan Edwards&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is for you, if &s;incere, to &s;et us the ex|ample, by a repeal of the Briti&s;h &s;tatutes, which &s;ub|jects &s;laves in the plantations to be taken in execu|tion, and &s;old for the debts of Briti&s;h creditors, and is the mo&s;t cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive regulation, under which the&s;e people groan."</Q> The remon&s;trance is ju&s;t. This &s;tatute is a perpetual bar to the happine&s;s and improvement of the Negro, and till it be repealed, all attempts at further regulations are u&s;ele&s;s. That a creditor, under the &s;anction of a Briti&s;h act of Parlia|ment, &s;hall &s;eize upon a body of men, women, and children, as on a herd of cattle; that he &s;hall be im|powered, for no crime or mi&s;conduct of theirs, to tear them from their habitations, to &s;eparate the wife from the hu&s;band, the mother from her children, and di&s;per&s;e them to different ma&s;ters, in different i&s;lands, is a re|proach to this country, which ought effectually to pre|vent its upbraiding the planters with &s;everity to their &s;laves. Even in the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;ituations of &s;ociety, the common &s;ympathies of human nature will at times be felt, and frequent intercour&s;e may excite, and has excited an attachment between the &s;lave and his ma&s;ter, or between the ma&s;ter and his numerous and dependant family; but what pity can exi&s;t in the bo&s;om of a creditor, re&s;ident in England, who&s;e only object is the recovery of his money, and who con&s;iders the unfortunate victims of his rapacity as the &s;ubjects of a legal di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">The oppo&s;ition to the repeal of this cruel &s;tatute will not ari&s;e from the planters, but from tho&s;e powerful capitali&s;ts in Great Britain, who advance them money on &s;tipulations, which often return an enormous rate of intere&s;t; but it will not be difficult to &s;hew that &s;uch a regulation, whil&s;t it is injurious to the planter, is not favourable to his creditors, and has no better tendency than to excite a conte&s;t among them, who &s;hall be the fir&s;t to tear his property in pieces. When the Negroes are thus carried off the e&s;tate to &s;atisfy the demand of a &s;ingle creditor, what is to become of the mortgagee of the real property, who&s;e &s;ecurity is there|by rendered unproductive? or of the other creditors, who have no re&s;ource but in the impri&s;onment of an in&s;olvent? To deprive a planter of the in&s;truments, by which alone he can extricate him&s;elf from his difficul|ties, merely to gratify an avaricious or re&s;entful credi|ditor, is the height of inju&s;tice to the re&s;t. Let the Negroes then be attached to the e&s;tate, and di&s;po&s;ed of or retained with the inheritance. The planter will thus be enabled to exert him&s;elf with confidence, and if he &s;hould eventually prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, the &s;ale of his whole property together will be more advantageous to his creditors, than the &s;uffering it to be di&s;membered by conte&s;ted claims. By the&s;e regulations the planter will be e&s;&s;entially benefited; the Negro will have a fixed re&s;idence, will become dome&s;ticated and attached to the &s;oil, and the creditors at large will have a &s;e|curity again&s;t preferences by a partial transfer, the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of which is equally impolitic and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Next to the repeal of this obnoxious &s;tatute, it would appear advi&s;able that the &s;ituation of the &s;laves in the
<PB N="77" REF="79">
different i&s;lands &s;hould be a&s;&s;imilated to each other.&mdash; According to the pre&s;ent laws of tho&s;e i&s;lands the Ne|groes are in &s;ome of them con&s;idered as real property, de&s;cendible to the heir, and in others as per&s;onal pro|perty which ve&s;ts in the executors, and are liable to be &s;old from the e&s;tate. That, which has been found ad|vantageous or tolerated in one i&s;land, cannot prove in|jurious to another; and it may therefore be pre&s;umed that no great objection would be made to a regulation, which &s;hould declare that the Negroes &s;hall in all ca&s;es de&s;cend with the e&s;tate, and &s;hall not be devi&s;able from it, even by will. Being thus placed on the &s;ame level, they would become the equal objects of any re|gulation, which might hereafter be propo&s;ed for their benefit; which, in their pre&s;ent precarious &s;ituation, it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;hould be the ca&s;e. This would al&s;o pre|vent any per&s;on not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an e&s;tate from acquir|ing a property in a &s;lave, and would put an in&s;tant pe|riod to the inhuman and incrcea&s;ing cu&s;tom of purcha&s;|ing &s;laves, in order to hire out their labour to tho&s;e planters, who will pay the highe&s;t price.</P>
<P>Were the foundations thus laid, &s;uch further im|provements might be introduced as would &s;oon an&s;wer the great ends, which I pre&s;ume you have in view. But con&s;iderations of this nature would lead me beyond my limits, and I have &s;carcely time to di&s;patch this letter by the po&s;t, &s;o as to have a chance of reaching you in London before the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion takes place. I have, however, taken the liberty of tran&s;mitting you a &s;mall pamphlet publi&s;hed in the year 1788, at the clo&s;e of which you will find &s;ome hints towards a bill for the gradual abolition of the African Trade, and the final

emancipation of the &s;laves; and I &s;hall be truly happy if any effort of mine can in the lea&s;t degree contribute towards &s;o great and de&s;irable an event.</P>
<P>It has ju&s;tly been ob&s;erved that arguments, deduced from general principles, are equally valid from what|ever quarter they may come; and this might have been my apology for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing my &s;ignature; but I like not an anonymous addre&s;s, and as I have a full confi|dence that, in expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h to be unknown to any per&s;on but your&s;elf, my purpo&s;e will be fully an&s;wered, I beg leave to &s;ub&s;cribe,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not receive the favour of your letter of the 9th in&s;tant, till ye&s;terday about an hour or two be|fore I went down to the Hou&s;e of Commons, with my mind, as you may imagine, tolerably well filled with my &s;ubject. I did not venture to read more than three or four pages of it, for a rea&s;on, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, may appear extraordinary. The fir&s;t part of this ex|cellent, and in my judgment incomparable performance, &s;ugge&s;ted to me a very important hint, of which I &s;aw I could avail my&s;elf in the cour&s;e of the debate; but I was really and &s;eriou&s;ly afraid to expo&s;e my&s;elf to that
<PB N="79" REF="81">
force and nece&s;&s;ity of taking more, which I was very &s;ure the remainder of your letter would impo&s;e upon me. The rea&s;on of this fear was founded upon a ju&s;t and prudent di&s;tru&s;t of my own capacity. I dreaded the con&s;equence of receiving more than I might be able to dige&s;t, even of food of the be&s;t quality. I have now peru&s;ed the whole of your letter, with the &s;ame continued attention which the fir&s;t lines of it excited, and with perfect &s;atisfaction. It appears to me, and I &s;ay it with a grateful &s;entiment of hone&s;t pride, that, if we had concerted our principles, and agreed upon a plan together, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to conceive a more exact concurrence of principles, views, and opinions, than that which exi&s;ts between your's and mine. With re&s;pect to the act of George II. or to that part of it, which you &s;o ju&s;tly and ably reprobate, it was certainly my intention to have moved, at a proper time, for a repeal of it; that is, if I had been &s;uffered to take the fir&s;t &s;tep of all, without which you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that I could not have a point to &s;tand upon. I am afraid the ca&s;e is now de&s;perate. When abolition is propo&s;ed, you hear of nothing but a won|derful readine&s;s to accept of regulations, and, with or without a law, to carry them into effect. When regu|lations are propo&s;ed, they have another remedy to re&s;ort to. 1. The Parliament of Great Britain have no right to legi&s;late for the We&s;t India I&s;lands, parti|cularly if any act of that power &s;hould involve the effect of taxation, tho' the produce or the effect &s;hould operate &s;olely where it was created, that is, in the I&s;lands them&s;elves, and no way to the benefit of Great Britain. 2. You, who dare to &s;tir &s;uch a que&s;tion at all, are an incendiary and a traitor.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>April</HI> 14, 1796.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG you to accept my grateful thanks for your communication of the debate on your motion, and for your very kind letter, which has relieved me from the apprehen&s;ion, of which I could not dive&s;t my&s;elf, of having un&s;ea&s;onably, and perhaps unnece&s;&s;arily, in|truded on your time.</P>
<P>It is in &s;ome degree fortunate for tho&s;e, who have been accu&s;tomed to intere&s;t them&s;elves in the welfare of their fellow creatures, as well white as black, that they are not, in the&s;e times, very &s;u&s;ceptible of the pangs of di&s;appointment. The repul&s;es they have met with, on all occa&s;ions, have blunted their feelings to that angui&s;h (the keene&s;t, perhaps, of any not de|rived
<PB N="81" REF="83">
from con&s;cious criminality) which re&s;ults from the defeat of a great and di&s;intere&s;ted attempt; and the failure of your motion is only another example of tho&s;e outrages again&s;t truth, ju&s;tice, and humanity, which have of late &s;o frequently di&s;graced this age and country. After the mi&s;eries, which mankind have recently &s;uffered from the &s;hock of extreme opinions, it might have been expected that he, who &s;hould rai&s;e the &s;tandard of moderation, would not find him&s;elf in want of volunteers.</P>
<P>But the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e; and, whatever may be the ju&s;tice of his preten&s;ions, and with whatever candour and per&s;picuity they may be inforced, he will find that, with a great majority of his hearers, the welfare of others is an object of much le&s;s importance than the gratifying their own particular notions. Thus the man, who di&s;dains to &s;toop to regulate an iniquitous abu&s;e, becomes the accomplice of him, who contends that the abu&s;e ought not to be corrected, and forgets that mo&s;t important maxim,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;&s;unt certi denique fines,</L>
<L>Quos ultra citraque nequit con&s;i&s;tere rectum.</L></Q>
<P>There is, however, one great man, who, when the intere&s;ts of humanity are at &s;take, is &s;uperior to the gratification of a per&s;onal feeling; who&s;e enlightened mind can perceive the wi&s;dom of doing what good is in his power, in the expectation of preparing the way for more, who, if he &s;toops for a moment from the known dignity of his principles, does it only to ri&s;e with a greater effort; and who, when he cannot promote the
<PB N="82" REF="84">
intere&s;ts of virtue, will at lea&s;t take care that he is not &s;educed into the ranks of her enemies. The approba|tion and &s;upport of &s;uch a man, and of the few, who have on this occa&s;ion followed his example, will to your own mind be a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation, and may &s;afely be taken as a deci&s;ive proof of the rectitude and nece&s;&s;ity of your mea&s;ures, in oppo&s;ition to the mixt majority of over-virtuous, and over-vicious, who, by different roads, met in mon&s;trous alliance at the &s;ame part of the circle, and equally contributed to overturn a mea&s;ure calculated to produce the utmo&s;t degree of practicable at lea&s;t, if not of po&s;&s;ible good.</P>
<P>I cannot, Sir, conclude without again expre&s;&s;ing my thanks for your indulgence to my ha&s;ty remarks, of which I am the more &s;en&s;ible, as I perceive, from your addre&s;s to the Hou&s;e, how little you &s;tood in need of them. I &s;hall not, however, regret the few hours devoted to them, as they have been honoured with an approbation, with which I cannot but be highly gra|tified, and have afforded me an opportunity of expre&s;|&s;ing the thorough &s;en&s;e I have of the rectitude and firmne&s;s of your public conduct, both on this and for|mer occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I can have no objection to your converting my re|marks to any purpo&s;e in which they can be in any de|gree u&s;eful; but, as my name can give them no addi|tional weight, I mu&s;t beg you will permit it to remain unknown.</P>
