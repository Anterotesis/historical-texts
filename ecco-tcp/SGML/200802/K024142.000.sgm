<P>IN Compliance with your Reque&s;t I have publi&s;h'd the following Di&s;|cour&s;e. That it was not de&s;ign'd for the Pre&s;s, will perhaps appear but too plainly in the Peru&s;al.

<P>Fail not to be with them that weep: and to mourn with them that mourn.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AS Charity, or univer&s;al Bene|volence, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of our holy Religion; &s;o among&s;t all the various Branches of this noble and exten&s;ive Duty, there is not perhaps one more truly amiable, or more highly requi&s;ite, in every Station and Circum&s;tance of Life, than that which I &s;hall make the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e; which, as it is ex|pre&s;&s;ive of a &s;ympathetic Tenderne&s;s peculiar to our Natures, is mo&s;t emphatically &s;tiled <HI>Hu|manity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">COMPASSION, or a friendly Sen&s;e of Sor|row for the Misfortunes of our Fellow Crea|tures, was originally implanted in our Minds by the great Author of them, and de&s;ign'd as the Alarms of a kind and impartial Father to engage us to relieve a di&s;tre&s;s'd Brother: And hence it ari&s;es, that our Hearts, like mu&s;ical Strings, feel every Vibration which is made on tho&s;e of our Friend, or our Neighbour, and do as it were in&s;en&s;ibly and involuntarily beat to each others Plea&s;ures and Pains.</P>
<P>AMONGST our modern Pretenders to Rea|&s;on and Philo&s;ophy, there have not indeed been wanting Men of low and contracted Minds, of &s;ullen and unfeeling Di&s;po&s;itions, who by &s;peci|ous Arguments, and artful Refinements, have endeavour'd to degrade the Dignity of our Na|ture, and rob us of every &s;ocial Virtue. Good-nature and Beneficence have been term'd Self-intere&s;t and Di&s;&s;imulation; Humanity branded with the Name of Weakne&s;s; and Compa&s;&s;ion derided as a Folly.</P>
<P>WHETHER it be owing to the fal&s;e Philo|&s;ophy of &s;uch Writers, who &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly blend the Colours of Virtue and Vice as to render it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate and di|&s;tingui&s;h them, or to the natural Depravity of Mankind, heighten'd and inflam'd by the ill Examples of a licentious Age, or both together,
<PB N="7" REF="5">
is hard to be determined; but certain it is, that we are at pre&s;ent &s;o lo&s;t in the idle Amu&s;e|ments, or &s;wallow'd up in the Debaucheries of the World, that almo&s;t all the Ties of Nature are broken through or neglected, and &s;ocial Love and Affection bani&s;h'd from the Brea&s;ts of Men. Alliances are made, and Friend&s;hips contracted without that mutual Love and Since|rity, which alone can render them la&s;ting or a|greeable: We are willing enough to <HI>rejoice with them that rejoice,</HI> to partake of the Hap|pine&s;s and good Succe&s;s of others; but will not <HI>weep with them when they weep, or mourn with them that mourn.</HI> Men in &s;hort are but too well acquainted with the Follies, the Vices and the Faults of their Neighbours, and only Stran|gers to their Misfortunes.</P>
<P>THERE are Ills enough, &s;ays the &s;elfi&s;h Man, cruel and unavoidable Ills, which fall to my own Share; why then mu&s;t I increa&s;e the Burthen by bearing the Weight of others? <HI>Suf|ficient for my Day is the Evil thereof.</HI> Thus trifling and in&s;ignificant are the Arguments of the&s;e Men, who would &s;helter their Pride and Inhumanity under the Ma&s;k of Prudence, and dre&s;s up the low and &s;ordid Vice of Selfi&s;hne&s;s in the Habit of Virtue. Such have little Title to the Bene|fits of that Nature they partake of; but are to be look'd on as Limbs cut off from the Body of Society, as wither'd and &s;aple&s;s Branches, which
<PB N="8" REF="6">
yield neither Shade nor Fruit; <HI>fit only to be hew|ed down and ca&s;t into the Fire.</HI></P>
<P>TRUE <HI>Religion and undefiled before</HI> GOD, &s;ays our SAVIOUR, <HI>is this; to vi&s;it the Fatherle&s;s and Widows in their Affliction.</HI> A Religion, which, as he taught, he practi&s;ed al&s;o. He was him&s;elf a <HI>Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief:</HI> Surely he hath born our Sorrows, and &s;uffer'd for our Iniquities; and &s;hall we not &s;hew that Com|pa&s;&s;ion to our Fellow-creatures, which he &s;o ten|derly be&s;tow'd on us; or dare we flatter our|&s;elves that, if we neglect this impartial Duty, the &s;ame all-&s;eeing GOD, who condemns our Inhumanity, will not al&s;o puni&s;h our Ingra|titude?</P>
<P>WEEP <HI>with them,</HI> &s;ays the wi&s;e Man; that is, with all them <HI>that weep.</HI> He does not &s;ay with our Parents, our Relations, or our Children; but embraces the whole Range of Nature, and takes in all Mankind. Even our Enemies are to be pitied and relieved. If the Man, who hath in|jured us, falls into Affliction, we are no longer to con&s;ider him as an Adver&s;ary, whom we hate, but as a Fellow-creature we mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t. We may remember he is not our Friend, but we mu&s;t not forget he is our Neighbour.</P>
<P>BUT if the Motives of Rea&s;on and Religion are not &s;ufficient to per&s;uade us, Self-Intere&s;t, which
<PB N="9" REF="7">
reigns in every Brea&s;t, will exert her Powers to excite us to it. The Tear we refu&s;e to &s;hed over the mi&s;eries of others, GOD, and GOD only knows, how &s;oon we may &s;tand in need of. <HI>Great Travail is created for every Man, and an heavy Yoke is upon the Sons of Adam; from him that &s;itteth upon a Throne of Glory to him that is humbled in Earth and A&s;hes.</HI> How often does an unexpected Stroke of Fortune put an End to the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Views of Happi|ne&s;s, and change the chearful Scene of Joy and Comfort into a melancholy State of Mi&s;ery and De&s;pair! If therefore we do not pity tho&s;e, who are in Affliction, when we fall into it our&s;elves, who will pity and relieve us? Then &s;hall we remember the Afflictions of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and &s;ay as his Brethren did, when they came into Trouble; <HI>We are very guilty concerning our Brother, in that we &s;aw the Angui&s;h of his Soul, when he be&s;ought us, and would not hear; therefore is this Di&s;tre&s;s come upon us.</HI> What black and obdurate Hearts mu&s;t tho&s;e Men have, who can look with Indifference and Un|concern on the Misfortunes of others? Can &s;uch Men be honour'd, e&s;teem'd, or tru&s;ted in any of the Affairs of Life? Shall we not be always apprehen&s;ive, that Villany and Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t be the Companions of Pride and Inhuma|nity? Surely, to be in&s;en&s;ible of the Mi&s;eries of others is the next Step to rejoicing in them; and the Man, who neglects us when unhappy, would not &s;cruple to make us &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8">THAT the Duty I am recommending is an important and a nece&s;&s;ary one, every impartial Man is, I believe, &s;ufficiently convinced. That it is al&s;o ea&s;y and delightful, is a Truth &s;carce le&s;s &s;elf-evident. It is equally attainable by every Man, in every Station and Profe&s;&s;ion. A Science, which requires no Superiority of Wealth, Parts, or Knowledge, to make us Ma|&s;ters of. We have not all of us Riches to be|&s;tow on the Indigent; we cannot impart Health to the Sick, or re&s;tore Youth to the Aged; but we have all of us Eyes to look upon, Hearts to feel for and &s;ympathize with, Tongues to &s;peak to and comfort the Afflicted.</P>
<P>HOW great an Aver&s;ion &s;oever the gay and unthinking Part of Mankind may have to all that is grave and melancholy, it may with the greate&s;t Truth be a&s;&s;erted, that he, who is a Stranger to Sorrow, is a Stranger to the be&s;t Emotions, the noble&s;t Feelings the human Heart is capable of receiving. In the Cup of Affliction there is always a Cordial thrown in by Providence to make the Draught le&s;s bitter, and the very Tears of Virtue admini&s;ter a more &s;olid Satis|faction to a right Mind than Vice and Folly have Power to be&s;tow. There is in &s;ome Men a re|markable Tenderne&s;s of Di&s;po&s;ition, and a Deli|cacy of Sen&s;ation; which tho&s;e, whom we fal&s;ely term the Brave and Re&s;olute, are too often Strangers to; a Di&s;po&s;ition which, however we
<PB N="11" REF="9">
may &s;ometimes ridicule and de&s;pi&s;e, is what will in the End mo&s;t intimately unite and endear them to us: Tho&s;e Things, which in Health and Pro&s;|perity may rai&s;e our Laughter and Contempt, in Sickne&s;s and Adver&s;ity meet with our E&s;teem and Approbation; and we &s;eldom know the true Merit of Compa&s;&s;ion, till we feel the Want of it.</P>
<P>AS big with Ills as human Life is, yet by the Ob&s;ervance of this &s;hort and important Precept of my Text, half the Mi&s;eries of Mankind might be &s;oftened or removed; for there is &s;carce a Misfortune we are liable to here, to which the Society, the Sympathy and Condolement of a &s;incere Friend cannot admini&s;ter &s;ome Re|lief:</P>
<P>IN Poverty: In Affliction, in Sickne&s;s, and in old Age.</P>
<P>IN regard to Poverty, it mu&s;t indeed be con|fe&s;s'd that the be&s;t Method of &s;hewing our Com|pa&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e, who labour under it, is to &s;upply their Nece&s;&s;ities; the happy Lot of the Fortunate, whom GOD hath ble&s;&s;ed with Abundance. But this is not the only Means, by which the Poor may be relieved. We may <HI>weep with them when they weep, and mourn when they mourn</HI>; and the tender Tear, &s;hed by the good Man over the de|&s;titute and unhappy, may perhaps give him as
<PB N="12" REF="10">
much Con&s;olation as that Alms, which the Proud and Unfeeling be&s;tows on him from O&s;ten|tation.</P>
<P>IN Regard to Afflictions, it may be ob&s;erv'd; that among&s;t tho&s;e, which daily &s;urrounds us, there are &s;ome of &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive and violent a Na|ture as to &s;ink the Soul into a State of the deepe&s;t Melancholy and De&s;pair. This is, for the mo&s;t Part, the Time, when the Mind, too &s;ore to admit of Con&s;olation, will yet find &s;ome Relief in the Condolement of a Friend. Tho' we can|not heal the Wound, we may yet pour a Balm into it to mitigate the Pain; and here the Text points out the exact Method and Mea&s;ure of our Duty. We mu&s;t <HI>not fail to weep with them, that weep.</HI> At &s;uch a Time, Wit would be odious and Mirth un&s;ea&s;onable. We are to behave in a Manner &s;uitable to the Situation of tho&s;e we vi&s;it; to make u&s;e of all the Arts, which Friend|&s;hip can &s;ugge&s;t; to &s;often their Sorrows; to calm the Tempe&s;t of their Grief, and &s;ooth them if po&s;&s;ible into Re&s;t, Re&s;ignation and For|getfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>IF the Sympathy and Society of a Friend can afford Comfort in Poverty and Affliction, no le&s;s is its Efficacy in the unavoidable Ills of Sickne&s;s and old Age; and I appeal to the Hearts of all who have langui&s;h'd under any of tho&s;e Di&s;tempers our weak Frames are &s;ubject to, if ever the Sight of their Friends was &s;o plea&s;ing
<PB N="13" REF="11">
to their Eyes, or the Voice of tho&s;e, they lov'd, &s;o &s;weet to their Ear as when they came in that melancholy Hour of Di&s;tre&s;s to vi&s;it and relieve them.</P>
<P>BUT if we even e&s;cape tho&s;e cruel Di&s;orders, that are the common Portion of Humanity (which how few do Experience will te&s;tify) there is, after all, the Di&s;ea&s;e of old Age to be encoun|ter'd with; and in that Train of Ills, which attend, there is not perhaps a greater than that Solitude, which generally accompanies it. The old Man has &s;eldom any Amu&s;ements but his own Reflections; any con&s;tant Companions but his Infirmities. Even the Bonds of natural Affection and the Ties of Kindred are found too weak to hold the Impatience of Youth by the Side of Age and Imbecillity. Here then, above all, &s;hould we exerci&s;e the Duties of Humanity and Compa&s;&s;ion; to &s;upport the Steps of the Feeble; to rai&s;e the drooping Head, and chear the afflicted Heart. Such humane and tender Of|fices we &s;hall all, if we live, expect our&s;elves. They make the Burthen of Years more tolera|rable; &s;mooth the Bed of Death, and teach us to re&s;ign Life with Calmne&s;s and Tranquillity into the Hands of HIM that gave it.</P>
<P>IF ever there was a Time for the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e to demand your mo&s;t &s;eri|ous Attention; if ever the Virtues of Huma|nity and Compa&s;&s;ion had room to exert all their
<PB N="14" REF="12">
Power, and &s;hine with di&s;tingui&s;h'd Lu&s;tre; it is at this remarkable and melancholy Sea|&s;on. The very late dreadful and unfore&s;een Calamity, which has &s;o alarm'd and terrify'd us, and from which we are our&s;elves, by the Ble&s;|&s;ing of GOD, &s;o miraculou&s;ly deliver'd, call upon me to point out to you but too many mo&s;t de|&s;erving, mo&s;t unhappy Objects of your Commi|&s;eration. The innumerable, the almo&s;t irretrie|vable Mi&s;eries, which Scenes of this Kind are productive of, cannot be conceived, much le&s;s expre&s;s'd. I need not, I believe, exhort you to condole with, to relieve and &s;upport, by all the Means in your Power, the unfortunate Sufferers. Terror and Affright have hitherto been the only Sen&s;ations they were capable of receiving. They have not yet been &s;ufficiently at Lei&s;ure to feel them&s;elves unhappy, or found Time to count their Misfortunes. When tho&s;e Hours come, I tru&s;t we &s;hall not want Tears to <HI>weep with,</HI> or unfeigned Sorrow to <HI>mourn with them</HI>; and in the mean Time it highly concerns us to look nar|rowly into our&s;elves. That we are now here; that we po&s;&s;e&s;s our Lives and Properties in Safe|ty; whil&s;t almo&s;t every Thing round us lies bu|ried in Ruin and De&s;olation, is a &s;ignal In&s;tance of the Divine Mercy in our Behalf.</P>
<P>ALL the Parts of this great Metropolis, which have e&s;caped the Fury of this cruel Di&s;a&s;ter, ought doubtle&s;s, with Hearts full of Gratitude, &s;incerely to acknowledge the Hand of Providence
<PB N="15" REF="13">
in their Pre&s;ervation. But it hath plea&s;ed GOD, that the &s;mall, the fortunate Number of tho&s;e, to whom I now addre&s;s my&s;elf, are by a Peculia|rity of Circum&s;tances tho&s;e, who, of all Men, have the mo&s;t Rea&s;on to return Thanks to Al|mighty GOD for his late Mercies vouch&s;afed unto them. What Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, what Wonder and Adoration is not due to that gracious Being, which hath thus pre&s;erved us; who when the devouring Flame had &s;pread Mi&s;ery and De&s;truction on our Right Hand and on our Left; when there was nothing but Tears, and <HI>complaining in our Streets,</HI> and we expected every Moment to be &s;wallowed up in the general Ruin, thus &s;topt it ju&s;t at our Doors, and &s;aid to the de&s;tructive Element, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou go, and no further!</HI></P>
<P>LET us then <HI>&s;in no more, le&s;t a like, or perhaps a wor&s;e, Thing happen unto us.</HI> Let the Storm, which hath blown over us, and the Danger we have e&s;caped, teach us the Things, which be|long to our Peace. Let them &s;tir us up to the important Duties of our Religion. Let us apply our&s;elves more earne&s;tly to Prayer and Thank&s;|giving. I am &s;ure we &s;hall be, of all Men, the mo&s;t unde&s;erving and ungrateful, if we do not now frequent this Hou&s;e of GOD, when it is to his gracious Mercy alone we are &s;o vi&s;ibly indebt|ed for the Pre&s;ervation of it. A Ble&s;&s;ing our un|fortunate Neighbours are deprived of; who have
<PB N="16" REF="14">
not a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Church was &s;o much damaged by the Fire as to make it impo&s;&s;ible to perform Divine Service there till repaired.</NOTE> Place of public Wor&s;hip left, wherein to &s;end up their &s;ad Prayers to GOD for Succour un|der their Afflictions.</P>
<P>To him therefore, who &s;aved us when we had well nigh peri&s;hed, let us give, as we are mo&s;t bounden, continual Thanks; be&s;eeching Him to grant that this his Tenderne&s;s towards us, may fill us with the mo&s;t lively Sen&s;e of his Goodne&s;s, and the &s;incere&s;t Acknowledgment of it; that we may lead a new Life, following his Commandments and walking henceforth in his Holy Ways.</P>
<P>THAT as thou, O GOD, ha&s;t in the Mid&s;t of Judgment remember'd Mercy; as thou ha&s;t &s;aved <HI>our Souls from Death, our Eyes from Tears, and our Feet from falling,</HI> we may laud and magnify thy Holy Name, prai&s;e, ble&s;s and glo|rify thee, and finally that, as thy Goodne&s;s hath interposed to &s;ave us in this World, thy Mercy may pre&s;erve us in that, which is to come; through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.</P>
