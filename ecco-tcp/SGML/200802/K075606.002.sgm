<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN CARYLL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Caryll, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was probably a Su&s;&s;ex man, and wrote two plays,
"The Engli&s;h Prince&s;s, or the Death of Richard III, 1667," quarto;
and
"Sir Salomon, or the Cautious Coxcomb, 1671," quarto.
It may be conjectured that he was of the Roman Catholic per&s;ua&s;ion, being &s;ecre|tary to Queen Mary the wife of James the Second, and one who followed the fortunes of his abdicating ma&s;ter. How long he continued in this &s;ervice is unknown, but he was in England in the reign of Queen Anne, and recommended the &s;ubject of Mr. Pope's "Rape of the Lock" to that au|thor, who on its publication addre&s;&s;ed it to him. He was alive in 1717, and at that time mu&s;t have been a very old man. See three of his Letters in "Additions to Pope," vol. II. p. 114. R.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>And every grove learns Amaryllis name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader may be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that Virgil, un|der the name of Tityrus, per&s;onates him&s;elf, newly &s;aved by the favour of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, from the general calamity of his Mantuan neighbours; who&s;e lands were taken from them, and divided among&s;t the veteran &s;oldiers, for having been dipt (as may be pre&s;umed) in the &s;ame guilt with their borderers of Cremo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a; who, in the civil wars, joined with Ca&s;&s;ius and Brutus. The&s;e Mantuans are likewi&s;e per&s;onated by Meliboeus; as al&s;o by Amaryllis the city of Rome, by Galatea that of Mantua, are repre&s;ented. The drift of this E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">logue is to celebrate the munificence of Augu&s;tus towards Virgil, whom he makes his tutelar God; and the better to &s;et this off, he brings in Meliboeus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his Mantuan neigh|bours, pathetically relating their own deplorable condition, and at the &s;ame time magnifying the felicity of Tityrus. This his exemption from the common calamity of his coun|trymen, Virgil &s;hadows over with the allegory of a &s;lave re|covering his liberty. And becau&s;e &s;laves did not commonly u&s;e to be infranchi&s;ed till age had made them u&s;ele&s;s for la|bour; to follow the trope, he makes him&s;elf an old man, as by the Candidior Barba, and the Fortunate Senex, &s;uffici|ently appears; though, in reality, Virgil at that time was young, and then fir&s;t made known to Augu&s;tus by the re|commendation of his ver&s;es, and of his friends Varus and Maecenas.

<HEAD>ECLOGUE II.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. NAHUM TATE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Born about the middle of the reign of king Charles II. in the kingdom of Ireland, where he received his education. He was made poet laureat to king William, upon the death of Shadwell, and held that place till the acce&s;&s;ion of George I. on whom he lived to write the fir&s;t birth-day ode, which is executed with unu&s;ual &s;pirit. He was a man of good-nature, great probity, and competent learning; but &s;o extremely mode&s;t, that he was never able to make his fortune, or to rai&s;e him&s;elf above nece&s;&s;ity. The earl of Dor&s;et was his patron; but the chief u&s;e he made of him was, to &s;creen him&s;elf from the per&s;ecution of his creditors. He died in the Mint, Augu&s;t 12, 1716; and was &s;ucceeded in the laurel by Mr. Eu&s;den. He was the author of nine dramatic per|formances, a great number of poems, and of a ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms in conjunction with Dr. Nicholas Brady. He was a man of wit and parts, yet not thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s any very great genius, as being deficient in what is its fir&s;t character|i&s;tic, namely, invention. Thus far the Biographical Dicti|onary.&mdash;His mi&s;cellaneous poems are enumerated by Jacob, who &s;ays, Tate's poem on the Death of Queen Anne, which was one of the la&s;t, is
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"one of the be&s;t poems he ever wrote."</Q>
His &s;hare in the
"Second Part of Ab&s;alom and Achitophel"
is far from incon&s;iderable; and may be &s;een in the Engli&s;h Poets, vol. XIII. p. 160.
He publi&s;hed al&s;o "Memorials for the Learned, collected out of eminent Au|thors in Hi&s;tory, &amp;c. 1686,"
8vo. and his
"Propo&s;al for regulating of the Stage and Stage Plays, Feb. 6, 1698,"

She died in 1722, at the age of 84. An old-fa&s;hioned monument with an epitaph, which &s;eems to have been de&s;igned by Sir W. Temple in his life-time, is erected in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey,

<BYLINE>BY SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE, BART.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Sir William Temple was de&s;cended from a younger branch of a family of that name, &s;eated at Temple Hall in Leice&s;ter&s;hire. His grandfather was &s;ecretary to the unfor|tunate earl of E&s;&s;ex, favourite of queen Elizabeth, and his father was Sir John Temple, ma&s;ter of the rolls in Ireland. He was as much above the common level of politicians, as he was above the herd of authors. He di&s;played his great abi|lities in &s;everal important treaties and negotiations, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which was the bringing to a happy conclu&s;ion the famous triple league betwixt England, Sweden, and Hol|land. This alliance, though the mo&s;t prudent &s;tep ever taken by Charles II. was &s;oon defeated by the Cabal, a &s;et of men who were as great a di&s;grace to their country, as Sir William Temple was an honour to it. He was &s;trongly &s;oli|cited to go over to Holland, in order to break that league which he had a little before concluded: but he was too much a patriot to yield to any &s;olicitations of that kind; and cho&s;e to retire into the country, where he was much better employed in writing his excellent
"Ob&s;ervations on the Uni|ted Provinces,"
and other elegant works. Few authors have been more read, or more ju&s;tly admired, than Sir Wil|liam Temple. He di&s;plays his great knowledge of book<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and men in an elegant, ea&s;y, and negligent &s;tyle, much like the language of genteel conver&s;ation.

<HEAD>ON MRS. PHILIPPS'S DEATH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Catharine Philipps, better known by the poetical name of Orinda, was the daughter of John Fowler, merchant&punc; and born in London, 1631, as Wood and Ballard (in 1633 ac|cording to Jacob); was married to James Philipps, of the Priory of Cardigan, e&s;q. about the year 1647; and died in Fleet-&s;treet, in the month of June, 1664. Her poems, in|cluding two tragedies, "Horace" and "Pompey," both tran&s;|lated from Corneille, were collected in a folio volume, and afterwards reprinted in octavo. She was al&s;o the writer of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> volume of Letters (publi&s;hed many years after her death) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Sir Charles Cotterel, intituled,
"Letters from Orinda to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">+liarchus;" which have been much admired.
<Q><L>" Orinda's works, with courtly graces &s;tor'd,</L>
<L>" True &s;en&s;e in nice expre&s;&s;ions will afford."</L>
<BIBL>Dr. King, vol. III. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"></BIBL></Q>
Mrs. Philipps was as much famed for her friend&s;hip, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> her poetry; and had the good fortune to be equally e&s;teem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the be&s;t poet and the be&s;t divine of her age. Dr. Jeremy Taylor addre&s;&s;ed his di&s;cour&s;e
"on the nature and effects of friend&s;hip" to this lady; and Mr. Cowley has celebrated her memory, in an Ode particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the very learned and &s;agacious editor of his "Select Works."&mdash;The indu&s;trious Mr. Langbaine &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;he was one that equalled the Le&s;bian Sappho, and Roman Sulpicia: as they were prai&s;ed by Horace, Martial, Au&s;onius, and other antient poets; &s;o was this lady commended by the earls of Orrery and Ro&s;common, by Cowley, Flatman, and other eminent poets."</Q>
Sir John Denham added a fifth act to her tragedy of "Horace," which was performed at court by per|&s;ons of quality, in 1678. In the prologue, &s;poken by the duke of Monmouth, it was ob&s;erved, that
<Q><L>" While a woman Horace did tran&s;late,</L>
<L>" Horace did ri&s;e above a Roman &s;tate."</L></Q>
The commendation &s;he received from Lord Ro&s;common is thus hand&s;omely returned by Mrs. Philipps:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lord Ro&s;common is certainly one of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing young noblemen in Ire|land. He has paraphra&s;ed a P&s;alm admirably; and a &s;cene of Pa&s;tor Fido very finely, in &s;ome places much better than Sir Richard Fan&s;haw. This was undertaken merely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> compliment to me, who happened to &s;ay that it was the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;cene in Italian, and the wor&s;t in Engli&s;h.

It begins thus:
<Q><L>" Dear happy groves, and you the dark retreat</L>
<L>" Of &s;ilent horrour, Re&s;t's eternal &s;eat."</L></Q>
From the&s;e lines, which are &s;ince &s;omewhat mended, it ap|pears that he did not think a work of two hours fit to en|dure the eye of critici&s;m without revi&s;al. When Mrs. Phi|lipps was in Ireland, &s;ome ladies, that had &s;een her tran&s;lation of Pompey, re&s;olved to bring it on the &s;tage at Dublin; and, to promote their de&s;ign, Lord Ro&s;common gave them a prologue, and Sir Edward Dering an epilogue; "which," &s;ays &s;he,

For copies of this and the following poem I am indebted to a volume in the Lambeth Library, 39. 6. 13. fol. mo&s;t ob|ligingly communicated by Dr. Ducarel.&mdash;The Reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed at being pre&s;ented with two Latin poems (though perhaps of no &s;uperior excellence) by &s;o capital a writer. By the &s;econd of them it appears that in 1662 he had the degree of B.A. and had obtained a fellow&s;hip; though neither of tho&s;e academical honours attended has name in 1661. One of his earlie&s;t productions (written in 1650, the year he went to College) is already printed in vol. I. p. 181. with a prologue and two epilogues to "The Duke of Gui&s;e," none of which are in any edition of his works. If the&s;e poems had come to light before the publication of Dr. John&s;on's excellent Life of Dryden, that judicious Biographer would certainly have made &s;ome alteration in the following paragraph:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"At the univer&s;ity he does not appear to have been eager of <HI>poetical</HI> di&s;tinction, or to have lavi&s;hed his <HI>early wit</HI> either on fictitious &s;ubjects or publick occa&s;ions. He pro|bably con&s;idered that he who purpo&s;ed to be an author, ought fir&s;t to be a &s;tudent. He obtained, whatever was the rea&s;on, <HI>no fellow&s;hip</HI> in the College. Why he was excluded, cannot now be known, and it is vain to gue&s;s; had he thought him|&s;elf injured, he knew how to complain.

He married lady Catharine daughter of Robert earl of Cardigan, by whom he had two &s;ons, John lord Clair|mont, and Charles Middleton, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> who were both taken at &s;ea by admiral Byng, in the de&s;cent which the French in|tended upon Scotland in 1708; but, by the queen's orders, they were &s;oon relea&s;ed, and died in France without i&s;&s;ue.

In this &s;ituation, &s;ome of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s poetry having been handed about, he was honoured with a vi&s;it by the earls of Roche&s;ter and Dor&s;et, Sir Charles Sedley, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. In 1678 he was tutor to the &s;on of Judge Thurland, and in 1681 to a &s;on of Sir Wil|liam Hickes. By the advice of Sir William and the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of Dr. Lower, he applied, for about a year, to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic; but, poetry being predominant, he ha&s;tened to London, and became a perfect votary to the bottle, yet without &s;inking into the debauchery of his contemporary wits. As he was of a very different turn from his father, the character of the old par&s;on, at the end of his works, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been de&s;igned for him. It is perhaps the mo&s;t extravagant caricature that ever was drawn. He was patronized by the earl of King&s;ton, who would have made him his chaplain if he would have qualified him&s;elf. He lived with the earl, however, till his death, which was oc|ca&s;ioned by the &s;mall-pox, Dec. 9, 1683. He was parti|cularly e&s;teemed by Mr. Dryden; who has done him great ju&s;tice in "Ver&s;es to his Memory," (Engli&s;h Poets, vol. XIV. p. 161.) His works have been frequently printed in one volum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 8vo; in 1722 in two volumes 12mo. with the Author's Life; and very lately, under the in&s;pection of Captain Thomp&s;on, in three volumes, 12mo.

<HEAD>REMEDY OF LOVE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN EVELYN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of the great natural philo&s;opher, and born at Sayes-Court near Deptford, upon the 14th of January 1654, and was there educated with great care. He was &s;ent to Oxford in the year 1666, where he remained in the hou&s;e of Dr. Bathur&s;t, then pre&s;ident of Trinity-college, before he was admitted a gentleman-commoner, which was in Ea&s;ter-term 1688. It is not clear at what time he left Oxford; but Mr. Wood &s;eems to be po&s;itive that he took no degree there, but returned to his father's hou&s;e, and pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudies under his directions. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, however, that, during his re&s;idence in Trinity-college, he wrote that elegant Greek poem, which is prefixed to the &s;econd edition of the Sylva; and is a noble proof of the &s;trength of his genius and won|derful progre&s;s in learning in the early part of his life. He di&s;covered his proficiency &s;oon afterwards, both in the ancient and modern languages, by his elegant tran&s;lations; as well as his intimate acquaintance with the Mu&s;es, in &s;ome original poems, which were much admired. His works will be mentioned pre&s;ently. He married Martha, daugh|ter and co-heire&s;s of Richard Spencer, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> and, having a head as well turned for bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;tudy, became one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the revenue in Ireland. He would pro|bably have been advanced to higher employments, if he had lived; but he died at his hou&s;e in London, upon the 24th of March 1698, in the 45th year of his age. He was father of the late &s;ir John Evelyn, who was born at Sayes-Court upon the 2d of March 1681, and created a baronet by letters patent, bearing date July 30th, 1713. This gentleman's productions in the literary way were, 1.
"Of Gardens, four books, fir&s;t written in Latin ver&s;e by Renatus Ra|pinus, and now made Engli&s;h by John Evelyn, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR>"
1673, 8vo. Con&s;idering how much he mu&s;t have been obliged to hear of gardens and plantations, we need not wonder that he &s;hould employ him&s;elf upon this &s;ubject. His father an|nexed the &s;econd book of this tran&s;lation to his Sylva. 2.
"The life of Alexander the Great, tran&s;lated from the Greek of Plutarch."
This was printed in the fourth volume of Plutarch's Lives by &s;everal hands. 3.
"The hi&s;tory of the grand vi&s;iers, Mahomet and Achmet Co|progli; of the three la&s;t grand &s;eigniors, their &s;ultanas, and chief favourites; with the mo&s;t &s;ecret intrigues of the &s;eraglio."
1677, 8vo. This was a tran&s;lation from the French, and has been e&s;teemed an entertaining and in|&s;tructive hi&s;tory. He was al&s;o author of &s;everal occa&s;ional poems, the be&s;t of which are here pre&s;erved. N.</NOTE>, ESQ.</BYLINE>

He was committed to the Tower on the 30th of Ja|nuary, whence in June 1642 he was relea&s;ed on giving 5000l. bail. Withdrawing to Norwich, he lived there in tolerable quiet till April 1643. But then, the order for &s;eque&s;tering no|torious delinquents being pa&s;&s;ed, in which he was included by name, all his rents were &s;topped, and he had nothing to live on but what the parliament allowed him; all the while &s;uffering the greate&s;t inconveniences, which he has given an account of in a piece, intitled his "Hard Mea&s;ure." In the year 1647, he retired to a little e&s;tate, which he rented at Higham near Norwich; and in this retirement he ended his life on the 8th of September 1656, in the 82d year of his age. He was buried in the church-yard of that pari&s;h with|out any memorial: for in his will he has this pa&s;&s;age,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I do not hold God's hou&s;e a meet repo&s;itory for the dead bodies of the greate&s;t faints."</Q>
He is univer&s;ally allowed to have been a man of great wit and learning, and of as great meekne&s;s, mode&s;ty, and piety. He was &s;o great a lover of &s;tudy, that he earne&s;tly wi&s;hed his health would have al|lowed him to do it even to exce&s;s. His works, be&s;ides the Satires above-mentioned, make in all five volumes in folio and quarto; and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are filled, &s;ays Mr. Bayle, with fine thoughts, excellent morality, and a great deal of piety."</Q>
His writings &s;hew, that he was very zealous again&s;t popery; neither was he more favourable to tho&s;e who &s;eparated from the mother-church without an extreme nece&s;&s;ity. He la|mented the divi&s;ions of prote&s;tants, and wrote &s;omething with a view of putting an end to them. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>TRANSLATED BY MR. SAM. BOYSE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Jo&s;eph Boy&s;e, a Di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter of great eminence in Dublin (who was one of the 16 children of Mr. Matthew Boy&s;e of Leeds) well known by his controver&s;ial writings again&s;t Abp. King.&mdash;Samuel was born in 1708, and received his education at Dublin; at 18, he was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Gla&s;gow; and, marrying before he was 20, returned to Dublin with his wife, where the conduct of neither was commendable. The hu&s;band, who had no graces of per&s;on and fewer &s;till of conver&s;ation, pa&s;&s;ed his time in abject trifling; the wife, in intrigue: and their extrava|gance reduced his father to indigence. In 1731 young Boy&s;e re&s;ided at Edinburgh, where he publi&s;hed a volume of poems, addre&s;&s;ed to the counte&s;s of Egleton, the patrone&s;s of all men of wit. Here al&s;o Mr. Boy&s;e particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf by an elegy, called "The Tears of the Mu&s;es," on the death of the vi&s;counte&s;s Stormont; which introduced him to the noble vi&s;count; and al&s;o to the dutche&s;s of Gordon, who had engaged for him an office in the cu&s;toms, which he lo&s;t by an unpardonable remi&s;&s;ne&s;s. The dutche&s;s &s;ent him to London with recommendations to Mr. Pope and the lord chancellor King. He went to Twickenham; but, the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not being at home, he never repeated the vi&s;it; by the peer he was mo&s;t graciou&s;ly received. From this period he wrote many poems; but tho&s;e, though excellent in their kind (and &s;uf|ficient, it is &s;aid, to have filled at lea&s;t &s;ix volumes) were lo&s;t to the world, by being introduced with no advantage. He had &s;o &s;trong a propen&s;ity to groveling, that his acquaintance were generally of &s;uch a ca&s;t as could be of no &s;ervice to him; and tho&s;e in higher life he addre&s;&s;ed by letters, not having &s;ufficient confidence or politene&s;s to conver&s;e familiarly with them; a freedom to which he was intitled by the power of his genius. His genius was not confined to poetry only; but he had a ta&s;te for painting, mu&s;ic, and heraldry, with the latter of which he was well acquainted. Many of his poems are in the Gent. Mag. &s;igned Y. and Alceus. In 1743 he publi&s;hed his "Albion's Triumph," an ode on the battle of Dettingen; and in or about 1745 wrote an admirable poem called "The Deity," which Mr. Pope declared, on its publication, contained many lines of which he &s;hould not be a&s;hamed. It was al&s;o commended by the late Henry Field|ing, who gave a quotation from it, (&s;ee Tom Jones, B. vii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 1.) and at the &s;ame time very ju&s;tly &s;tyled it <HI>a noble on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> This unfortunate man, by addicting him&s;elf to low vices, among which were gluttony and extravagance, rendered him|&s;elf &s;o contemptible and wretched, that he frequently was without the lea&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for days together. After &s;quan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ring away in a dirty manner any money which he acquired, he has been known to pawn all his apparel; and in that &s;tate was frequently confined to his bed, &s;itting up with his arms through holes in a blanket, writing ver&s;es in order to procure the means of exi&s;tence. It &s;eems hardly credible, but it is cer|tainly true, that he was more than once in that deplorable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ituation, and to the end of his life never derived any advan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge from the experience of his pa&s;t &s;ufferings.

<HEAD>THE COURT-PROSPECT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. CHARLES HOPKINS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Son of Ezekiel bi&s;hop of Londonderry (who married the lady Araminta one of the 4 daughters of John lord Robartes of Truro afterwards earl of Radnor). He was born at Exeter; but, his father being taken chaplain to Ireland by lord Ro|bartes when lord lieutenant in 1669, our poet received the early part of his education at Trinity College, Dublin; and afterwards was a &s;tudent at Cambridge. On the rebellion in Ireland in 1688, he returned thither, and exerted his early valour in the cau&s;e of his country, religion, and liberty. When public tranquillity was re&s;tored, he came again into England, and fell into an acquaintance with gentlemen of the be&s;t wit, who&s;e age and genius were mo&s;t agreeable to his own. In 1694 he publi&s;hed &s;ome
"Epi&s;tolary Poems and Tran&s;lations," which will all be in&s;erted in this volume; and in 1695 he &s;hewed his genius as a dramatic writer by "Pyrrhus king of Egypt," a tragedy, to which Mr. Con|greve wrote the epilogue (&s;ee Engli&s;h Poets, vol. XXIX. p. 84).
He publi&s;hed that year "The Hi&s;tory of Love," a connexion of &s;elect fables from Ovid's Metamorpho&s;es, 1695; which, by the &s;weetne&s;s of his numbers and ea&s;ine&s;s of his thoughts, procured him con&s;iderable reputation. With Mr. Dryden in particular he became a great favourite. He after|wards publi&s;hed the "Art of Love," which, Jacob &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"added to his fame, and happily brought him acquainted with the earl of Dor&s;et and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, who were fond of his company, through the agreeablene&s;s of his temper and the plea&s;antry of his conver&s;ation. It was in his power to have made his fortune in any &s;cene of life; but he was always more ready to &s;erve others than mindful of his own affairs; and, by the exce&s;&s;es of hard drinking, and a too pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s for the fair &s;ex, he died a martyr to the cau&s;e in the 36th year of his age."</Q>
I &s;hall pre&s;erve in this collection an admirable Hymn
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"writ|ten about an hour before his death, when in great pain."</Q>
His "Court-Pro&s;pect," in which many of the principal no|bility are very hand&s;omely complimented, is called by Jacob <Q REND="inline">"an excellent piece;"</Q> and of his other poems he adds,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that they are all remarkable for the purity of their diction, and the harmony of their numbers."</Q>
Mr. Hopkins was al&s;o the author of two other tragedies;
"Boadicea Queen of Britain," 1697;
and
"Friend&s;hip improved, or the Female Warrior," with a humorous prologue, comparing a poet to a merchant, a compari&s;on which will hold in mo&s;t part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">culars except that of accumulating wealth.
Our author, who was at Londonderry when this tragedy came out, in|&s;cribed it to Edward Coke of Norfolk, e&s;quire, in a dedica|tion, dated Nov. 1. 1699, &s;o mode&s;t and pathetic that I am per&s;uaded I &s;hall &s;tand excu&s;ed if I print it at full length:<Q REND="inline"><P>"The greate&s;t, and indeed almo&s;t the only, advantage a poet reaps from what he writes, is the opportunities he meets with of making him&s;elf known to the be&s;t and greate&s;t men of his age. A play is fir&s;t made public in the theatre; and when it comes to the pre&s;s, if any one has &s;poken kindly and favourably of it in the repre&s;entation, the poet choo&s;es him for his patron, he having before (according to the author's con&s;truction) cho&s;en him for his poet. The di&s;tance I am at from the city, and even from the kingdom too, will keep me ignorant for &s;ome time what &s;ucce&s;s this play (which I humbly offer to your patronage) may meet with. If the town is plea&s;ed with it, I &s;hall be plea&s;ed with my&s;elf for plea&s;ing them; if they condemn it, I &s;hall be apt to conclude &s;o many in the right, rather than my &s;ingle &s;elf. You &s;aw it in manu&s;cript; and I have this early and au&s;picious advantage, that you approve of it. Boadicea plea&s;ed them; and I received a very great additional &s;atisfaction, when I under&s;tood how particularly it plea&s;ed you. I will not go to compare that play and this together, nor follow the cu&s;tom of reckoning the la&s;t per|formance be&s;t, and &s;hewing the greate&s;t fondne&s;s of the younge&s;t brat. The rhyme was the only thing that recom|mended that; and, for aught I know, the only thing too that can recommend this.

If the pains in writ|ing will endear it to you, it co&s;t me much more than the former. It has &s;ome &s;ort of de&s;ign be&s;ides (&s;uch as it is); but I was never very guilty of plotting. I can hardly keep the characters in my play from being as hone&s;t and &s;incere as I would be my&s;elf in a dedication. A vicious character di&s;turbs me while I draw it, and it grates me to delineate a villain. 'Tis certain no poet can excite any pa&s;&s;ion in ano|ther, if he does not feel it fir&s;t in him&s;elf. Who then will choo&s;e to de&s;cribe di&s;content, envy, or revenge, when they may have &s;uch fair fields as honour and virtue to range in? All there is bright before them, and the flight the Mu&s;e takes the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s heavenwards. Such characters, artfully and ju&s;tly drawn, will excite the good and great to be patrons; and &s;uch patrons as you, Sir, will &s;oon teach poets to draw &s;uch characters. You are endowed with all the ble&s;&s;ings of Nature and Fortune; and you are as liberal of the gifts of the latter to others, as &s;he has been to you. So great is your e&s;tate, it would be unwieldy to have it more; and &s;uch good u&s;e is made of it, that Envy does not wi&s;h it le&s;s. It is not con&s;umed in vain and &s;uperfluous equipage; but laid out in maintaining the old, open Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality. De&s;ert in want is &s;up|plied; and Hone&s;ty in di&s;tre&s;s is &s;uccoured and &s;u&s;tained; great without titles, and good above greatne&s;s; rich, rather to others than your&s;elf; and &s;eeming only as your own &s;tew|ard. Your inclinations and endeavours are the general good of mankind; and none ever went from you di&s;&s;atisfied; delighted in obliging others, and plea&s;ed to &s;ee them plea&s;ed with your bounty. Wi&s;hing the welfare of all men, and &s;peaking well of all men, is a &s;ure way to meet with an uni|ver&s;al return of good will and good wi&s;hes. He doubly en|joys his fortune, who has it wi&s;hed double by all that know him. Among the prayers of others, accept of the prai&s;es of the poet; humbly and heartily, though feebly, offered. I now begin to experience how much the mind may be influenced by the body. My Mu&s;e is confined, at pre&s;ent, to a weak and &s;ickly tenement; and the winter &s;ea&s;on will go near to over-bear her, together with her hou&s;hold.

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>SOME writers perhaps may expect the thanks and favour of the nobility, after attempting their prai&s;e; but I am rather afraid of having incurred their di&s;|plea&s;ure; they whom I have mentioned, I doubt, may with more rea&s;on find fault with me, than they whom I have omitted; for it is better not to be drawn at all, than to be drawn imperfectly and lamely. The poet, however, has the &s;ame excu&s;e with the painter; that art cannot equal nature; nor the pencil, nor the pen, pre|&s;ent a copy that comes up to her original. The bu&s;ine&s;s of a poet is to plea&s;e; and he is very unhappy who gives offence where he de&s;igns acknowledgments or re&s;pects. The whole body of the nobility of England would be a boundle&s;s &s;ubject; painters own they find it more difficult to give a true and lively air and po&s;ture to a picture; to place the legs, and duly proportion all the parts, than to draw the face, and take the likene&s;s: but this piece was only intended for an half-length, and that too is only a rough draught, and in miniature. Though the following lines may want an excu&s;e with the cri|ticks,
<PB N="189" REF="192">
I will not de&s;pair of pardon from the nobles to whom it was de&s;igned; and if I have failed in de&s;cribing their greatne&s;s, I have at the &s;ame time given them an opportunity of &s;hewing their goodne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>TO ANTHONY HAMMOND<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To this gentleman Mr. Hopkins in&s;cribed his
"Epi&s;to|lary Poems and Tran&s;lations," in a dedication worth pre|&s;erving:
<Q REND="inline">"The following ver&s;es ought in ju&s;tice to be yours, &s;ince not only the be&s;t part of them were made at your hou&s;e, but they were made de&s;ignedly for you, &s;o that this is not a de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ication written to a book, but a book written to a dedication; which, however, is the nice&s;t part a writer has to manage; for the mo&s;t de&s;erving men are the mo&s;t aver&s;e to be told &s;o, and what would plea&s;e all their friends and acquaintance would di&s;plea&s;e them&s;elves; which makes the poet at a lo&s;s whether to di&s;&s;atisfy one or many, his readers or his patron. But, &s;ince I have already found it ea&s;ier to you to oblige, than to receive thanks for an obligation; to do no violence to your mode&s;ty, I mu&s;t do one to my own ju&s;tice, and de&s;i&s;t from a theme which I could &s;o willingly enlarge upon, but you &s;o unwillingly read. I &s;hall &s;ay little of the following e&s;&s;ays, either of the originals I tran&s;lated them from, or the tran&s;lations: one thing in general I find from my own experi|ence; that where there is mo&s;t life and &s;pirit in the author, the tran&s;lator is carried on with the greater vigour and vi|vacity, as a man &s;wims fa&s;ter in a &s;tream than a &s;tanding water; but where the original is flat and low, the tran&s;lator mu&s;t be at the pains to rai&s;e him; &s;o that the be&s;t things are the ea&s;ie&s;t to be done, and the dulle&s;t the mo&s;t difficult. It were pre&s;umption in one of my years, to pretend to give an account of the authors whom I have cho&s;en, or their works; to commend their excellences, or condemn their faults: and of the two, I dare venture to &s;ay the lea&s;t of Ovid; when he him&s;elf, and all that he has written, have been already &s;o well and &s;o fully treated of in Mr. Dryden's preface before his epi&s;tles. But I cannot choo&s;e but wonder, that a book &s;o extremely delightful, &s;o &s;oft and &s;weet, as Tibullus, has lain &s;o long unattempted; but there is a friend of ours, whom I hope he has been all along re&s;erved for, and then he will be in the be&s;t hands he could have fallen into. Of the three ele|gies that I have ventured on, the fir&s;t, from toward the middle to the end, and the whole third, plea&s;ed me infinitely; the &s;econd I did merely for the &s;ake of the la&s;t ten or twelve lines. Tibullus mo&s;t, certainly, have felt all he wrote, for he could never have feigned &s;o much pa&s;&s;ion &s;o well; and I am apt to believe it was not his poetry made him &s;o fond and tender a lover, but rather his love that made him &s;o &s;weet and excellent a poet. Were it not that I &s;hould take him out of better hands, I would have attempted to have engli&s;hed him all; for I flatter my&s;elf with a fancy, that, in &s;ome things, I am &s;omewhat of his temper; and how far &s;hort &s;o|ever I come or him in his poetry, I re&s;emble him but too nearly in &s;ome other circum&s;tances. I was almo&s;t running into a complaint, that would have been both unju&s;t and in|grateful; for, &s;ince I knew you, all occa&s;ion of complaint has been taken from me. Your acquaintance would have been of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to endear you to any man; but your favours to me began with, and even out-ran, your acquaintance. I dare not proceed, though on a &s;ubject which I am very loth to leave; permit me to add only this, that &s;ince mo&s;t who ever wrote have &s;ometimes &s;tood in need of favours from other men, and &s;ince the &s;ame fortune has attended me, I am glad, however, that it threw me on you to receive them, than whom I know none I could have been more willingly ob|liged to for them.

<P>MADAM, Beauty, as it is both the theme and in&s;pirer of Poetry, &s;o it ought to be the patrone&s;s too; and a poem of Love &s;hould in ju&s;tice be &s;acred to none but the Lovelie&s;t: it would therefore be adoring a fal&s;e Deity, &s;hould I offer up this at any &s;hrine but yours. As it is the be&s;t I can do, and written on the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;ubject, I was re&s;olved to lay it at the feet of the mo&s;t beautiful; and had I been my&s;elf at a lo&s;s where to fix, the univer&s;al opinion of the world would have directed me, and pointed out your Grace for the patrone&s;s; while the poem &s;hall la&s;t (and a poem of Love ought to la&s;t longer than any other) &s;ucceeding ages &s;hall read that your Grace was the ornament of this age. It is an innocent and harmle&s;s ambition in poets, who&s;e only de&s;ign in all they do is the plea&s;ing others, and in doing that plea&s;e them&s;elves be&s;t; and, as Beauty is the chief object they bend their &s;tudies to delight, all poets ought to a&s;pire to plea&s;e your Grace in particular. That ambition is the be&s;t excu&s;e I can make for my pre&s;umption in this dedication; &s;ince I am unknown to
<PB N="223" REF="226">
your Grace, and perhaps even unheard-of yet; but what is my crime is at the &s;ame time my plea for pardon; or rather it is my merit. The Athenians, when they dedicated an altar to the Unknown God, &s;hewed more devotion, and directed their devotion to a truer deity, than when they adored the many they knew. That I might be &s;ure of &s;omething acceptable in this offering, and not fail to delight in a poem of Love, where all ought to be delightful, I have taken all the mo&s;t moving tender things that Ovid and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ibullus &s;aid to their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, to &s;ay to mine; nor will I allow it to be a theft, &s;ince I doubt not, as it was their love that in&s;pir'd them with tho&s;e thoughts, mine would have infu&s;ed the &s;ame into me; and no man that thinks naturally of love can avoid running into the &s;ame thoughts with them. I have borrowed the examples to every pa&s;&s;ion from tho&s;e &s;tories which I thought the mo&s;t plea&s;ing in Ovid, where certainly the mo&s;t plea&s;ing were to be met with: &s;ome few places in every &s;tory I have tran&s;lated, but for the mo&s;t part I have only kept him in view; I have gone on with him and left him where I thought it proper, and by that means have avoided the ab&s;urdities of his Metamorpho&s;es; &s;ave only that of Pigmalion's &s;tatue, but that was a Meta|morpho&s;is that plea&s;ed me. It was a delightful &s;ur|prize to &s;ee life breathed into an inanimate beauty, as it would be a killing affliction to &s;ee it taken away from one already animated: it would occa&s;ion as much joy and wonder to have a Dutche&s;s of GRAFTON made by Art (if Art could do it) as it would cau&s;e con&s;ternation to have the Gods unmake one. But tho&s;e miracles of

Art are now cea&s;ed; and none but the Heavenly Arti&s;t could have drawn you, who has drawn you &s;o that he has left the painter and the poet at a lo&s;s to copy you. As to the &s;ucce&s;s of this poem, I hope I am &s;ecure, &s;ince it is &s;acred in general to the Fair Sex, and committed in particular to the protection of the Faire&s;t. If they are once plea&s;ed, who will dare to find fault? or di&s;oblige them by di&s;liking what they approve? Under the &s;hel|ter of your Grace's patronage I &s;hall &s;tand, like Aeneas, guarded by the Godde&s;s of Love; and no Diomedes &s;hall be found as de&s;perate as the fir&s;t to wound me through you. Thus, as all dedicating poets, who write more to rai&s;e their own reputation than their patrons, I have taken the mo&s;t effectual means to e&s;ta|bli&s;h mine; and doubt not to make a &s;trong party, &s;ince every Lover will defend what is &s;acred to the Lovely.

<L>He &s;poke, and &s;pread his wings, and mounted up,</L>
<L>Nor re&s;ted till he reach'd Parna&s;&s;us' top.</L>
<L>From his full quiver all his darts he drew,</L>

<L>Differing the pa&s;&s;ions which their points create,</L>

<L><PB N="271" REF="274">With this the beauteous virgin's brea&s;t he pierc'd;</L>

<L>There the wild boars were wounded with her &s;pear;</L>
<L>Her only pa&s;&s;ion was to conquer there.</L>
<L>All her attire was like Diana's train,</L>
<L>Alike her humour in avoiding men.</L>
<L>Her numerous courtiers met with numerous &s;lights,</L>
<L>She fled from Hymen and his hated rites:</L>
<L>Oft had her father prompted her to wed,</L>
<L>By fond de&s;ires of future grand&s;ons led:</L>
<L>Oft had he told her, that &s;he ow'd a debt</L>
<L>Of &s;miling nephews, which he hop'd-for yet.</L>
<L>She &s;tarts, and thinks &s;he under&s;tands him wrong,</L>
<L>Nor would have heard it from another tongue.</L>
<L>Then, hanging on her father, thus &s;he pray'd,</L>
<L>" Oh! only lov'd of all your &s;ex, &s;he &s;aid,</L>
<L>Oh! give me leave to live and die a maid!"</L>
<L>He, too indulgent, yields, but yields in vain,</L>

<L>And part in circles twining round her neck.</L>
<L>" If &s;uch their charms di&s;order'd thus, he cry'd,</L>

<L>He &s;ees her &s;parkling eyes, that &s;hine like &s;tars,</L>

<L>All nations offer incen&s;e at my &s;hrine,</L>
<L>And all tho&s;e beams that light the world are mine:</L>
<L>Jove does acknowledge me his darling &s;on,</L>
<L>And gives me power the greate&s;t next his own:</L>
<L>I know what Time bears in her teeming womb,</L>
<L>And all that was, and is, and is to come:</L>
<L>I teach &s;oft numbers to the mighty Nine,</L>
<L>The wondrous harmony they make is mine:</L>
<L>Sure are the wounds I &s;end from every dart,</L>
<L>But Love made &s;urer when he pierc'd my heart:</L>
<L>To the &s;ick earth &s;afe remedies I give,</L>
<L>Allotting man a longer time to live;</L>
<L>To me the u&s;e of every herb is known,</L>
<L>Vain art, alas! &s;ince Love is cur'd by none!</L>
<L>To all be&s;ides, they do their aid afford,</L>
<L>Unable only to relieve their Lord."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Much more he would have told the flying fair,</L>

<L><PB N="274" REF="277">With doubled &s;wiftne&s;s &s;he out-runs the wind,</L>

<L>Shew'd a whole Heaven of beauty to the God.</L>
<L>Her naked limbs to his full view di&s;play'd;</L>
<L>The God, the ravi&s;h'd God, &s;aw all the maid.</L>
<L>Her every &s;tep inflames his fierce de&s;ires,</L>
<L>Her every motion fans the raging fires.</L>
<L>Still the fair nymph grew lovelier as &s;he fled,</L>
<L>Loo&s;e in the air her golden locks were &s;pread,</L>
<L>And her cheeks glow'd with an unu&s;ual red.</L>
<L>Th' impatient God admits no more delay,</L>
<L>And throws no more unheeded words away:</L>
<L>Stronger his pliant limbs he &s;trives to move,</L>
<L>Love urges on, he takes new force from love.</L>
<L>So the &s;wift greyhound, when his game he views,</L>
<L>With eager &s;tretch o'er all the plain pur&s;ues;</L>
<L>Now comes &s;o near, that he is forc'd to &s;toop,</L>

<L>Whether &s;he is already &s;eiz'd or not;</L>
<L>She u&s;es all her art to help her flight;</L>
<L>And doubles ju&s;t enough to &s;cape the bite.</L>
<L>So Daphne flies, wing'd with, her mortal fear;</L>
<L>Wing'd with his love, &s;o Phoebus follows her.</L>
<L>But he &s;till gains advantage in the race,</L>
<L>For Love redoubles his impetuous pace.</L>
<L>With arms expanded, he pur&s;ues the fair,</L>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND;</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN HOPKINS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another &s;on of the good bi&s;hop of Londonderry; born Jan. 1, 1675. Like his elder brother, his poetry was princi|pally on &s;ubjects of Love; like him too, his pro&s;pects in life appear to have terminated unfortunately. He publi&s;hed in 1698
"The Triumphs of Peace, or the Glories of Na&s;&s;au; a pindarie poem occa&s;ioned by the conclu&s;ion of the peace between the Confederacy and France; written at the time of his grace the duke of Ormond's entrance into Dublin."
<Q REND="inline">"The de&s;ign of this poem, the author &s;ays in his preface, begins, after the method of Pindar, to one great man, and ri&s;es to another; fir&s;t touches the duke, then celebrates the actions of the king, and &s;o returns to the prai&s;es of the duke again."</Q>&mdash;But the principal performance of Mr. J. Hopkins was
"Ama&s;ia, or the Works of the Mu&s;es, a collection of poems in three volumes, 1700."
Each of the&s;e little vo|lumes is divided into three books, and each book is in&s;cribed to &s;ome beautiful patrone&s;s; among&s;t whom the dutche&s;s of Grafton &s;tands foremo&s;t. The la&s;t book is in&s;cribed
"To the memory of Ama&s;ia," whom he addre&s;&s;es throughout the&s;e volumes in the character of Sylvius.
There is a vein of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, if not of poetry, runs through the whole perform|ance. Many of Ovid's &s;tories are very decently imitated; <Q REND="inline">"mo&s;t of them, he &s;ays, have been very well performed by my brother, and publi&s;hed &s;ome years &s;ince; mine were written in another kingdom before I knew of his."</Q> In one of his dedi|cations he tells the lady Olimpia Robartes, <Q REND="inline">"Your lady&s;hip's father, the late earl of Radnor, when governor of Ireland, was the kind patron to mine: he rai&s;ed him to the fir&s;t &s;teps by which he afterwards a&s;cended to the dignities he bore; to tho&s;e, which rendered his labours more con&s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uous, and &s;et in a more advantageous light tho&s;e living merits, which now make his memory beloved. The&s;e, and yet greater temporal honours, your family heaped on him, by making even me in &s;ome &s;ort related and allied to you, by his inter-marriage with your &s;i&s;ter the lady Araminta. How imprudent a vanity is it in me to boa&s;t a father &s;o meritorious! how may I be a&s;hamed to prove my&s;elf his &s;on, by poetry, that only qualification he &s;o much excelled in, but yet e&s;teemed no excellence. I bring but a bad proof of birth, laying my claim in that only thing he would not own. The&s;e are, however, Madam, but the products of immaturer years; and riper age may, I hope, bring forth more &s;olid works."</Q>&mdash;I have never &s;een any other of his writings; nor have been able to collect any farther particulars of his life, but have a portrait of him under his poetical name of Sylvius.

<HEAD>SONG,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY LORD CUTTS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;oldier of mo&s;t hardy bravery in king William's wars. He was &s;on of Richard Cutts, e&s;q. of Matching in E&s;&s;ex, where the family were &s;ettled about the time of Henry the &s;ixth, and had a great e&s;tate. He entered early into the &s;er|vice of the duke of Monmouth, was aid-de-camp to the Duke of Lorrain in Hungary, and &s;ignalized him&s;elf in a very extraordinary manner at the taking of Buda by the Im|periali&s;ts in 1686; which important place had been for near a century and a half in the hands of the Turks. Mr. Ad|di&s;on, in a Latin poem worthy of the Augu&s;tan age, (Mu&s;ae Anglicanae, Vol. II. p. 2,) plainly hints at Mr. Cutts's di&s;|tingui&s;hed bravery at that &s;iege. Returning to England at the Revolution, he had a regiment of foot; was created Baron of Gowran in Ireland, Dec. 6, 1699; appointed Governor of the I&s;le of Wight, April 14, 1693; was made a Major-ge|neral; and, when the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination project was di&s;covered, 1695-6, was captain of the King's guard. He was Colonel of the Cold&s;tream, or &s;econd regiment of guards, in 1701; when Mr. Steele, who was indebted to his intere&s;t for a mili|tary commi&s;&s;ion, in&s;cribed to him his fir&s;t work,
"The Chri&s;tian Hero."
On the Acce&s;&s;ion of Queen Anne, he was made a Lieutenant-general of the forces in Holland; Commander in Chief of the forces in Ireland, under the Duke of Ormond, March 23, 1704-5; and afterwards one of the Lords Ju&s;tices of that kingdom, to keep him out of the way of action, a circum&s;tance which broke his heart. He died at Dublin, Jan. 26, 1706-7, and is buried there in the cathedral of Chri&s;t Church. He wrote a poem on the Death of Q. Mary (which is printed among the Court Poems); and publi&s;hed, in 1687, "Poetical Exerci&s;es, written upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, and dedicated to her royal highne&s;s Mary prince&s;s of Orange; licen&s;ed March 23, 1686-7, Roger L'E&s;trange." It contains, be&s;ides the dedi|cation &s;igned J. Cutts, ver&s;es to that prince&s;s; a poem on wi&s;dom, another to Mr Waller on his commending it; &s;even more copies of ver&s;es (one of them called
"La Mu&s;e Cava|lier,"
which has been a&s;cribed to Lord Peterborough, and as &s;uch mentioned by Mr. Walpole in the li&s;t of that nobleman's writings) and eleven &s;ongs; the whole compo&s;ing but a very thin volume; which is by no means &s;o &s;carce as Mr. Wal|pole &s;uppo&s;es it to be. The author &s;peaks of having more pieces by him. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>
