<HEAD>THE OPINION OF A Known Di&s;&s;enter On the BILL for <HI>Preventing Occa&s;ional Conformity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHAT is the publick Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Places, or Offices of Tru&s;t in a Government, to the Ca&s;e of Religion? They who &s;eparate from the Communion of a Church, cannot in rea&s;on expect to be entertained in the Service of that very Church: And they that &s;eparate from the Church, ought to con&s;ider <HI>Places</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> beforehand, and to examine whether they can forego them for their <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> or not, and if they did &s;o, they would not be &s;o frequently foregoing their <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s them a <HI>Gain.</HI></P>
<P>And I cannot but wonder at, and condemn the Inju&s;tice of &s;uch <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> who would have tho&s;e People, to who&s;e Communion they cannot or will not join, receive them into equal Advantages of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Profit,</HI> of <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> and <HI>Management,</HI> in the Politick Concern.</P>
<P>I cannot approve the equity of it, nor I would not have the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> covet it; nor had they the <HI>Government</HI> in their hands, would they admit it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This coveting <HI>Offices</HI> of <HI>Tru&s;t, Honour</HI> and <HI>Profit,</HI> in the Government, has been the cau&s;e of that <HI>Occa&s;ional Compliance,</HI> which to the Di&s;honour and Shame of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> has Branded them with too much Levity in Religion.</P>
<P>For whoever di&s;&s;ents from an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church on any account, but from a real Principle of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> is a <HI>Politick,</HI> not a <HI>Religious Di&s;&s;enter.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing can be Lawful and Unlawful at the &s;ame time. If it be not Lawful for me to Di&s;&s;ent, I ought to Conform, but if it be Unlawful for me to Conform I mu&s;t Di&s;&s;ent; and he that cannot Die, or at lea&s;t de&s;ire to do &s;o, rather than Conform, ought to Conform.</P>
<P>If I &s;hall Di&s;&s;ent, and yet at the &s;ame time Conform, by <HI>Conforming</HI> I deny my <HI>Di&s;&s;ent</HI> be|ing Lawful; or by my <HI>Di&s;&s;enting,</HI> I damn my <HI>Conforming</HI> as &s;inful.</P>
<P>An Act of Parliament is of every Mans own doing, and therefore 'tis ju&s;t every Man &s;hould comply with the Terms or &s;uffer the Penalty; but here is no Penalty, if no Crime, and if no Preferments are &s;ought, no Honours accepted, there is no Crime; if Self-denial was as practicable as Self-advancement, here is no need of <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> for all &s;uch do &s;eek the Crime, that is the fir&s;t Sin, then Mortgage their <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> to avoid the Penalty, and &s;o add one Sin to another.</P>
<P>No Man can be &s;aid to &s;eparate from, and join to a thing at the &s;ame time, if your Con|&s;cience is &s;atisfy'd in joining; it cannot be &s;atisfy'd in &s;eparating, unle&s;s you can &s;uppo&s;e your Con&s;cience to be &s;atisfy'd and di&s;&s;atisfy'd both together.</P>
<P>A Man pa&s;&s;ively Religious, that can Communicate any where, may from the &s;ame Principle, and with far le&s;s guilt, Communicate no where, for he has pro&s;tituted the little Religion he had, if ever he had any, to his Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>No <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t</HI> can be receiv'd into Communion in any <HI>Di&s;&s;enting A&s;&s;embly,</HI> up|on any other Terms than as a <HI>Penitent;</HI> for this Practice is prepo&s;trous, excentrick and de|&s;tructive of the very Foundation of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> Principles.</P>
<P>Methinks Men &s;hould &s;eem what they are, if a Man di&s;&s;ent from the Church let him do &s;o, and his Principle being well-grounded for &s;uch Di&s;&s;ent, let him hold it; if not well-grounded, let him leave it, if he cannot &s;uffer one way, let him &s;uffer another, and why &s;hould we not be as hone&s;t to God as our Country?</P>
<P>'Tis an intolerable Affront to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> reflecting upon its <HI>Doctrine</HI> as well as <HI>Practice,</HI> to make u&s;e of the <HI>Church</HI> for a <HI>Cover</HI> to fence them again&s;t the Laws, at the &s;ame time continuing to Di&s;own its <HI>Communion</HI> as a thing not fit to be continued in.</P>
<P><HI>Conformity</HI> and <HI>Nonconformity</HI> at the &s;ame time, in one and the &s;ame Per&s;on, for a Se|cular End, to &s;ave a penalty, and privately; and then, as being a&s;ham'd of it, to go back and &s;it down as not having done it at all, are Contradictions I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon, and rather wi&s;h, than expect to &s;ee rectify'd.</P>
<P>He who di&s;&s;ents from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, except from true Principles of Con&s;cience, is guilty of a great Sin.</P>
<P>He who Conforms to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church again&s;t his Con&s;cience, is guilty of a great Sin.</P>
<P>He who both Di&s;&s;ents and Conforms at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame point of Religion, mu&s;t be guilty of one of the&s;e great Sins.</P>
<P><PB REF="2" MS="y">
And he who has committed either of the&s;e Sins, ought not to be receiv'd again on either &s;ide, on any other Terms than a <HI>Penitent.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Partial Conformity,</HI> Di&s;&s;ent in &s;ome things, and Conforming in others, does not &s;eem to concern this Ca&s;e, no Man among the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> pretended to di&s;&s;ent in every thing, but we are &s;peaking of conforming in tho&s;e very Points in which we di&s;&s;ent, and that no le&s;s than the <HI>Article of Communion.</HI></P>
<P>If Gentlemen who have &s;uch a Latitude in their Opinions, wou'd not have it thought they are moved to it by their Intere&s;ts, let them practi&s;e it openly, and not Time it &s;o, to the every <HI>Eve</HI> of an Election, as to have it &s;peak of it &s;elf, and, as it were, force Men to believe it done on purpo&s;e; nay, let them not put &s;uch a Reproach in the Mouths of their Enemies, as to have it &s;poken in contempt, with circum&s;tances that &s;top the Mouths of Argument, and are as Convincing as Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>'Tis not a light thing to &s;hift and change Communion with an E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and with a Sepa|rate Church, as often as convenience, or Rea&s;on of State or Intere&s;t invite.</P>
<P>As to the Excu&s;e that is made, That this is no <HI>Conformity</HI> in Point of Religion, but done as a Civil Action, in Obedience to the Laws of the Land, as a Qualification for admittance in|to Publick Employments, which they think it their Duty to accept, in order to Serve their Country; are not Sacraments Religious Acts? Are they not the &s;ame thing, tho' differently Admini&s;tred in the E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and in the Di&s;&s;enting Church? And how can you take it as a Civil Action in one place, and a Religious Act in another? This is playing <HI>Bo peep</HI> with God Almighty, and no Man can tell when they are about a Civil Action, and when about a Religious. And if the Service of their Country be &s;o dear to them, pray why &s;hould they not undergo the Penalties, and chu&s;e to expo&s;e their Bodies and E&s;tates for that Service, rather than their Souls? The&s;e are Patriots indeed! that will damn their Souls to &s;ave their Country! For, as hath been ob&s;erv'd, <HI>Conformity</HI> is a Sinful Act in a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> or el&s;e his di&s;&s;enting before and after mu&s;t be a Sinful Act; and he has no Excu&s;e, unle&s;s it be that he was convinc'd and re-convinc'd, and then convinc'd again.</P>
<P>After de&s;cription of true <HI>Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> who cannot conform, he proceeds in this manner: If there are crept into their Company <HI>State-Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> or <HI>Politick-Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> they are not of them, and we wi&s;h they would go out from them. I &s;ee no Act of Parliament a making to the prejudice of this <HI>Di&s;&s;enter.</HI>&mdash;This is the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> to which Her Maje&s;ty has promis'd her Protection. The Act again&s;t <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> does not concern us, I dare undertake not one <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> offer'd to pre&s;ent a Petition to the Honourable Hou&s;e again&s;t its pa&s;&s;ing; they who can conform for one Rea&s;on, may conform without two, and ought to con|form. And we are therefore content to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd who cannot conform at all; if we have any Knaves among&s;t us, take them; if we have any Hypocrites, any who can conform and do not, we are free to part with them, that the remainder may be all &s;uch as agree with the true Character of a <HI>Con&s;cientious Di&s;&s;enter.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis plain, that <HI>Occa&s;ional Communion</HI> is contrary to the very Nature and Being of a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> who, if he can conform, ought to conform; and if he can for a Place of Prefer|ment, ought to do it without the Preferment.</P>
<P>It is an Act de&s;tructive of all po&s;&s;ible pretence for di&s;&s;enting, and never was, nor never can be defended by any <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> without overthrowing all the Rea&s;ons they could ever give for di&s;&s;enting; How then can this Bill be aim'd at the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters?</HI> We hold it to be a Novelty, an Abu&s;e crept in among&s;t us, and we are glad to have it condemn'd by Authority. We are &s;o content with the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the grievance of this &s;candalous Ambidexter <HI>Conformity,</HI> that we think the Hard&s;hips put upon us with it not worth the naming.</P>
<P>All the Parliaments that ever were, or will be, can never &s;uppre&s;s any thing among&s;t us &s;o &s;candalous to our Reputation, and to that Candour with which we de&s;ire to guide our Actions, nor &s;o contrary to, and de&s;tructive of the very Nature of our &s;eparating from the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and the Con&s;titution of all our Collected Congregations; and therefore, if the&s;e <HI>Oc|ca&s;ional Conformi&s;ts</HI> would accept of the Friendly Advice of their Brethren, it &s;hould be, That they would for the future conform to the <HI>Church of England.</HI></P>
<P>As for his Authority to write thus in the Name of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> he alledges that he hath the General Concurrence of all the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> he ever convers'd with, that Publication is an Appeal to the World, and if he hath affirm'd any thing in the Name of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> which is not their Opinion, he is liable to an ea&s;ie Confutation: <HI>Truth</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>is a General Com|mi&s;&s;ion, and any Man may write it.</HI></P>
<P>He mode&s;tly conceals his Name, that his Rea&s;ons might not come clogg'd with the dead weight of the Meanne&s;s and Imperfections of the Author: The <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> (&s;ays he) is not Condemn'd or Defended by the Names of Authors on either &s;ide, but by Truth, Scripture and Rea&s;on; and &s;o far as that is on his &s;ide, he thinks it ought not to be de&s;pis'd for being u&s;her'd in by an Unworthy In&s;trument.</P>
