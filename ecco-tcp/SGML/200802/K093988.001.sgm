<HEAD>HENRY TO THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Send you by the Bearer a Col|lection of the Letters, which you complimented us &s;o much upon, when you were la&s;t at my Hou&s;e; you &s;hould have had them before this, but my <HI>Clerk</HI> had not fi|ni&s;hed them 'till Ye&s;terday. I &s;hould have &s;tiled him <HI>Secretary</HI> for the greater Air of the Thing.</P>
<P>You will find &s;everal Cha&s;ms in the Series of our Corre&s;pondence, occa&s;ioned by our de&s;troying, on both Sides, all the Letters which related to private Hi&s;tory, or private Bu&s;ine&s;s; except a few which contained &s;ome Moral, or other Sentiment; and, in general, we neither of us pre&s;erved any of the other's Letters, which we did not think might
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
be an Entertainment to us to read over again, at &s;ome other Time, which was a Manner, I particularly, have very often employed my&s;elf in; for when|ever I found my Re&s;olution &s;tagger, with Regard to our Marriage, or was offended at any of her Letters, which betrayed Impatience, Caprice, or Su&s;pi|cion of my Love, I u&s;ed to take out a Parcel from this Collection, &s;ometimes more, or le&s;s, according to the Di&s;order in my Affection, and &s;o read away 'till I had &s;wallowed the <HI>quantum Sufficit</HI> to re&s;tore the full Health of my At|tachment to her.</P>
<P>And indeed it would amu&s;e you great|ly to hear the many ingenious Arts I have made u&s;e of, for the fir&s;t two or three Years of our Loves, to pre&s;erve my Con&s;tancy toward her; and I have actually, &s;everal Times, by the mere Force of Contemplation, worked my|&s;elf into &s;uch an Enthu&s;ia&s;m about her Knowledge, Genius, and Under&s;tand|ing, that, as you will ca&s;ually ob&s;erve, in going through this Collection, I have wrote <HI>Latin,</HI> Philo&s;ophy, and Metaphi|&s;icks to her, during the Faroxi&s;ms of the Fit; by which uncommon Proceed|ing,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
as I &s;ay in another Place;
<Q>I rea&s;oned my&s;elf into a real Pa&s;&s;ion for her,</Q>
&mdash;I will tell you why,&mdash;In Truth I could never have the lea&s;t En|joyment of Life, without the &s;weet In|dulgence of fond Affections, and I al|ways cho&s;e the mo&s;t natural ones. All the Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e, the Beauties of Nature, and the Pomp of Grandeur, to me are ta&s;tele&s;s. As to a &s;ick Man, without a certain Tenderne&s;s of Senti|ment, a Something, which as <HI>Horace</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>circum proecordia ludit,</HI> and gives a Reli&s;h to them all. I had quitted an Engagement of this Sort, about a Year before I entered into this, becau&s;e there were &s;everal Rea&s;ons which made it highly improper to con|tinue in it; and you cannot conceive what a wretched Vacuum of Life I pa&s;&s;ed during that Interval.</P>
<P>"I rather pa&s;s'd than &s;pent the Day." Before I could find out any Per&s;on who&s;e Sen&s;e, or Ta&s;te was agreeable enough to fix my Attachments. I led an un&s;atisfactory Vague, di&s;&s;ipated kind of Life, during this Interregnum; my Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections all in perfect Anarchy, and, like the Frogs, petition|ing
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
for a King: My Mind was li&s;tle&s;s, and my Time &s;auntered away without any Rule pre&s;cribed, or purpo&s;ed End: At la&s;t, like the worn out Smile of the <HI>Patriarch</HI>'s Dove, I found a re&s;t|ing Place, and grew timerous of ha|zarding again a Flight back into the troubled Ocean of Life.</P>
<P>Many of the Letters are di&s;placed, for want of Dates, and even tho&s;e which have them, the Amanuen&s;is has contrived to render Ob&s;cure, meerly by his Regularity; for as we corre&s;ponded for &s;everal Years, three Times a Week, without Intermi&s;&s;ion, by copying the Letters, according to their Dates, he has introduced this Confu&s;ion, that he has placed a Letter from <HI>Frances,</HI> &s;up|po&s;e, becau&s;e it was dated, for In&s;tance, the Fourth of the Month, immedi|ately &s;ucceeding the Date of one of mine, &s;uppo&s;e of the Second or Third; whereas he &s;hould have gone on to one of her's dated the Sixth; for by not allowing the Interval of a Po&s;t, the latter could not be an An&s;wer to the former; &s;o that by taking them &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, rather than alternately, he has made &s;everal of them appear like
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
a Game of Cro&s;s Purpo&s;es, where the An&s;wer never corre&s;ponds with the Que&s;tion, except it be by Chance.</P>
<P>However, I have endeavoured to &s;et the&s;e Matters right, as well as I could, by numbering the Letters, which you are to attend to &s;olely, and not to the Pages; but, doubtle&s;s &s;everal Mi&s;takes have &s;lipt my Attention, which I mu&s;t leave to your own Ob&s;ervation to correct.</P>
<P>In Return for all this Trouble, which I have taken on your Account, I hope for your critical Indulgence, while you read over the&s;e ha&s;ty and incorrect Pieces, wrote in the Hurry of a con|&s;tant Corre&s;pondence, many of them in the Mid&s;t of Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Company, and &s;everal in the Height of Sickne&s;s, and in the Intervals of which,
<Q>Aliter enim &s;cribimus, quod eos &s;olos quibus mittimus, aliter quod multos lecturos putamus.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cic. Ep.</NOTE></P>
<P>If I had taken the Pains of copying out the&s;e Letters my&s;elf, I could pro|bably have put many of them in a bet|ter Dre&s;s, and Letter ccxxxvii I &s;hould have left out intirely, becau&s;e I have
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
&s;ince been informed, that the natural Principle, which I pre&s;umed upon, in that Letter, about the Increa&s;e of Mat|ter, is fal&s;e; but I &s;hall let it go along with &s;everal others, which I think not worth reading, becau&s;e the Omi&s;&s;ion of them might break in upon the Thread of the Corre&s;pondence, and becau&s;e I promi&s;ed to &s;end you, <HI>bon&acirc; fide,</HI> every Letter which had been pre&s;erved, and this I take to be the be&s;t Way of deal|ing with a Friend, to throw our&s;elves on his Mercy, for the Whole of our Fault, rather than make a partial Pal|liation by &s;ecreting any Part of it.</P>
<P>I &s;end you the Originals, along with the Copy, that you may compare them together, which I confe&s;s I was too lazy to do; but &s;hould be plea&s;ed if any one el&s;e would take the Trouble of doing.</P>
<P>There are four Letters in this Col|lection, and but four, which have been wrote to three different Per&s;ons, Letters clxxxvii, cxc, cxcii, cxciii, for having Occa&s;ion to write to tho&s;e Per&s;ons, upon the &s;ame Subjects, the &s;ame Chain of Thought and Rea&s;oning na|turally

<HEAD>THE EDITOR TO THE PUBLICK.</HEAD>
<P>_I Here pre&s;ent you with a genuine Corre&s;pondence, which pa&s;&s;ed, for &s;everal Years, between a Gentleman and Lady of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI>; tho' the Scene has been laid in <HI>England,</HI> by the Authors, when the fir&s;t Copy was made out, as they de&s;igned to keep them&s;elves unknown, for Rea&s;ons which may be collected from &s;ome Parts of this Addre&s;s, and &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in their Letters.</P>
<P>I endeavoured to prevail on the Parties to take the Trouble of dige&s;ting this Collection into a more regular Series than they are, at pre&s;ent, offered to you in; but the various Bu&s;ine&s;s and family.
<PB N="xii" REF="10">
Concerns which they are engaged in, in the Country, would not afford them Lei&s;ure: And, indeed, there &s;eems to obtain, in them both, a certain Indo|lence of Mind, proceeding from a phi|lo&s;ophick Acquie&s;ence in their very narrow Fortunes, which would prevent either of them from giving them&s;elves &s;o much Trouble as a Ta&s;k of this Kind might require.</P>
<P>But tho' they would not conde&s;cend to be Compilers, even of their own Works, I was in Hopes that they might be prevailed upon to undertake a Work of Genius, by filling up the Cha&s;ms, which appear too often, in the Cour&s;e of this Collection: But this too they refu&s;ed me, from a certain Ingenuou&s;ne&s;s in their Natures, which proceeded &s;o far, that tho' there were a good Number of entertaining Letters wrote, &s;ince the la&s;t of the&s;e, yet they would not &s;uffer them to be in&s;erted, becau&s;e they were written &s;ince the fir&s;t De&s;ign of publi&s;hing this Collec|tion; which, however, was not any Thought of theirs, during the whole Cour&s;e of their Corre&s;pondence, but hinted to them by Lady <HI>O</HI>&mdash;, &s;o often
<PB N="xiii" REF="11">
mentioned, with Honour due, in the&s;e Letters, and who promi&s;ed to prevail on Lord <HI>O</HI>&mdash;, a Nobleman of di&s;tingui&s;h|ed Sen&s;e, Learning, and cla&s;&s;ical Ta&s;te, and who has &s;unk many eminent Titles of both Kingdoms, in the private Cha|racter of the Man, to revi&s;e and correct them for the Pre&s;s; but as higher Avo|cations have prevented them from ap|pearing before the Publick, with that Honour and Advantage, I have obtain|ed Leave, after a Twelve-month's Solli|citation, to di&s;po&s;e of them after what Manner I plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But I have been &s;o ju&s;t to the Au|thors, and to the Publick too, that I have not left out even the mo&s;t trifling Letter, which came to my Hands; my De&s;ign being not merely to give you a Collection of Letters, but to pre&s;ent you with the genuine Pictures of two Per&s;ons, who&s;e Sen&s;e, Wit, and uni|ver&s;al Benevolence do well intitle them to the publick E&s;teem, &mdash; (but their Characters are better de&s;cribed by their own Writings, than by any Thing I can &s;ay to recommend them) for which Rea&s;on I have not attempted to make a &s;ingle Alteration, nor, upon comparing
<PB N="xiv" REF="12">
the&s;e Letters with the Originals, which were &s;ent me along with the Copy, do I find there has been any Alteration made, except the changing of one Word for another, &s;hifting the Scene, as I hinted in the Beginning, and the leaving out whole Paragraphs, which related, as <HI>Henry</HI> has expre&s;&s;ed it, in the foregoing Letter, to private Hi&s;tory, or private Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Editor of St. <HI>Evremond</HI>'s Works &s;peaks as follows, in Part of his Pre|face to the third Volume.
<Q>One of the Objections made to this Author is that odd Medley of &s;erious and comical, of grave Matters and Trifles, which is to be met with in his Writ|ings. Would it not have been &s;uffi|cient, &s;ay certain au&s;tere and difficult Per&s;ons, to have made a Collection of all that is good and &s;olid? Why was not every. Thing left out, that is not only u&s;ele&s;s but waggi&s;h?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tho&s;e People who would have us apply our&s;elves only to u&s;eful Studies, ought to con&s;ider, that our Author is a Doctor, who writes to in&s;truct and dogmatize, and that he is not a Man engaged by his Profe&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="xv" REF="13">
to give the Publick an Account of his Time and Studies. He is a Gen|tleman, who having much Lei&s;ure, &s;eeks how to pa&s;s away the Time agreeably; who writes &s;ometimes on one Subject, &s;ometimes on another, only for his own Amu&s;ement. He is a Man of Wit, who propo&s;es to di|vert him&s;elf, as well as certain Per|&s;ons, with whom he conver&s;es: It would mo&s;t certainly be unju&s;t to judge of him with too much Rigour, and the Inju&s;tice would be yet greater, to oblige tho&s;e, who publi&s;h his Works, to &s;uppre&s;s all &s;uch as are purely diverting.</Q></P>
<P>So much, by Way of Apology, both for my Authors and my&s;elf; for I think the above Quotation is applicable, thro' the Whole, to our Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Cha&s;ms, I cannot barely &s;ay <HI>Nonnulla defunt,</HI> but <HI>Hiatus vald&eacute; deflendi</HI>; and when I declared my De|&s;ign of publi&s;hing, and applied a &s;econd Time to have the Chain connected, I was told, by <HI>Henry,</HI> that he thought it not fair Dealing with the Publick; that be&s;ides, he thought they appeared, at pre&s;ent, more genuine than a com|plete
<PB N="xvi" REF="14">
Suite of Letters would do; and farther &s;aid, that if the regular Series had been pre&s;erved from the Beginning, he would take out an Handful, here and there at random, and throw them into the Fire, le&s;t it might be &s;u&s;pect|ed that they were wrote, or pre&s;erved, with a De&s;ign of publi&s;hing, as he was humble enough to think that they could have but very little Merit in this View: In Allu&s;ion to which, he told me a Story of a certain Lady, who, upon reading over a Letter &s;he had wrote, about Bu&s;ine&s;s, to a Gentleman, and thinking it too Orthographical for a Woman, added an (e) to the Ende of &s;everale Word&s;e, le&s;te it &s;hould bee &s;u&s;pected that &s;he had &s;pelte by the Aid of a Dictionarye.</P>
<P>This Whim of his, which however may be ju&s;tified from a thorough Know|ledge of Mankind, puts me in mind of the virtuo&s;o Ta&s;te for mutilated Statues, and time eaten Coins, where the Parts which remain, ri&s;e in Value in Proportion to tho&s;e which are lo&s;t; or to the <HI>Dutch</HI> device of burning half their Spices, in order to inhance the Price of the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="15">But I was, at length, of Opinion with him in not framing any Letters to &s;upply the Cha&s;ms, becau&s;e it would, as he ob&s;erved, be di&s;ingenuous to give the Publick any Thing, in this Collec|tion, which was not Original; there|fore I have not, as I &s;aid before, even taken the Liberty, which the Authors paid me the high Compliment of in|dulging me in, of altering any one Sentence, which I thought might be better expre&s;&s;ed; or di&s;placing any Ar|gument which I pre&s;umed might, per|haps, be put in a &s;tronger Light; for certainly any Per&s;on, of a curious Ta&s;te, would rather &s;ee a true Copy of any Cla&s;&s;ick's original Text, though incor|rect, than read all <HI>Bentleii Emenda|tiones.</HI></P>
<P>However, I have thrown in a Note, here, and there, to explain the Occa&s;ion upon which &s;ome of the Letters were wrote, and to clear up &s;ome particular Pa&s;&s;ages or Allu&s;ions, which might not, perhaps, be intelligibe to every Reader: I have al&s;o arranged the Let|ters according to the Numbers, which are pre&s;cribed in the foregoing Letter, and the&s;e are all the Merits which I
<PB N="xviii" REF="16">
claim to my&s;elf, except the Publication, in the Cour&s;e of the following Collec|tion.</P>
<P>As I know nothing of the Lady, but from her Writings, I am not enabled to give any particular Account of her private Hi&s;tory, except that &s;he is of a Gentleman's Family, and had a very genteel Education, but was left, very young, without a Father, and without a Fortune. She is,&mdash;but <HI>Henry</HI> him|&s;elf will better tell you what &s;he is; and making poetical Allowances for the Hyperbole of his warm Manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in her Favour, I do not think he has at all exaggerated her Prai&s;e: And if his Writings do not &s;uf|ficiently de&s;cribe her Worth, I could &s;upply their Deficiency to the entire Satisfaction of the World, if I was at Liberty to tell them who Lady <HI>O</HI>&mdash; is, and that &s;he received her early into her Matronage and Friend&s;hip, from no other Tie or Attachment, but the Good|ne&s;s of her Character, and the Excel|lency of her Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> is a Per&s;on of as good a Fa|mily as any in this Kingdom, who&s;e Patrimony was formerly looked upon
<PB N="xix" REF="17">
to be very con&s;iderable; but Lo&s;&s;es and Misfortunes in his Family have reduced his Fortunes to a very moderate Com|petence at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>His Education was unfortunately neglected, notwith&s;tanding the early and continued fair Omens he always gave of the happy I&s;&s;ue, which might have been expected from it: While he was very young he e&s;&s;ay'd his genius in Poetry, and wrote &s;everal Things, which I have been told were &s;urprizing for one of his Years and untutored Mind.</P>
<P>He kept Copies of them for &s;everal Years, as he told me him&s;elf; 'till finding him&s;elf bereft at la&s;t, of all Hope of an Education, learned and polite enough to introduce him to <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Court, he threw them into the Fire, and applied his Mind to graver Studies, &s;aying, after his lively Manner, that a bad Shoe-maker was preferable to a bad Poet, for that it was better to coble for Bread, than coble to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>Being, at length, left upon the World at large, he had Sobriety and Addre&s;s enough to introduce him&s;elf, by De|grees, into the genteele&s;t and mo&s;t re|putable
<PB N="xx" REF="18">
Company, but grew &s;oon weary of the active Idlene&s;s, as he termed it, of a City Life, and retired upon a Vi|&s;it, to a near Relation in the Country, where he pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal Years in read|ing, teaching him&s;elf <HI>French,</HI> and &s;tu|dying Hu&s;bandry philo&s;ophically: Then he engaged him&s;elf in a Farm and the Linen Manufacture, in the Ma|nagement of which, and reading, he has employed him&s;elf for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, and where we &s;hall now take our Leave of him for the Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>His Acquaintance with <HI>Frances</HI> was accidental, and commenced, on his Part, as an Affair of Gallantry; but finding no Probability of Succe&s;s, and being enamoured with her Writings, Conver|&s;ation and Character, became, at la&s;t, a real and honourable Lover, but declin|ed Matrimony, for &s;everal Years, as &s;he had no Fortune, and his Expecta|tions from his Father were much larger than they are likely to turn out: To which Con&s;ideration you may add his other Relations and Friends, who&s;e In|tere&s;t he had great Pro&s;pects from, tho' 'tis probable he may, as he has hitherto been, be deceived in the&s;e too.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="19">At length they married, and it would not be ami&s;s, if the Reader, before he proceeded, &s;hould turn over to Letter ccxvi, where he will find the noble&s;t and mo&s;t rational Arguments given, for taking this Step, that ever ju&s;tified an Action, which the World might deem imprudent; and if the De&s;ign of this Publication was merely to &s;tamp a Cha|racter for my Friend, I need only print that Paper to his Prai&s;e: But as I am certain that the Publick will receive a very agreeable and improving Enter|tainment from the whole Collection, I &s;hall detain them no longer from the Peru&s;al of them, than while I &s;ub|&s;cribe my&s;elf, their unknown humble Servant.</P>

<P>My rea&s;ons for with-holding (not refu&s;ing as you call it) my Friend&s;hip at pre&s;ent are the&s;e which follow.</P>

Now, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> &s;ince our Friend&s;hip cannot be pure, let us &s;tick to that Pa&s;&s;ion, which may be &s;o, and is, in effect, but a warmer and more intimate Friend|&s;hip.

Pure Love, like pure Gold, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without an Allay, which, tho' it deba&s;es the ideal Value, enhances the true one, by making them both (Love and Gold) more fixed, and fit for U&s;e; and I dare an&s;wer for it, that the Love which does not begin in Friend|&s;hip will never end there. But Friend&s;hip is in|dependent, requires no Mixture, no Allay; it's Purity, contrary to the Nature of Gold, is it's Strength and Stability; nor is it without it's Elevations and Tran&s;ports; the mutual Contem|plation of Truth, and the Communication of Knowledge, being higher Enjoyments than mor|tal Sen&s;e is capable of, and, as <HI>Young</HI> &s;ays, upon this Subject,
<Q><L>True Friend&s;hip warms, it rai&s;es, it tran&s;ports,</L>
<L>Like Mu&s;ick, pure the Joy, without Allay,</L>
<L>Who&s;e very Rapture is Tranquility;</L>
<L>But Love, like Wine, gives a tumultuous Bli&s;s,</L>
<L>Heighten'd indeed beyond all mortal Plea&s;ures,</L>
<L>But mingles Pangs and Madne&s;s in the Bowl.</L></Q></P>
<P>As Friend&s;hip then is independent of Love, and &s;elf-&s;ufficient in it's own Nature, why may it not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, from it's own Purity, between Per&s;ons of different Sexes? tho' with the Advantage of more Delicacy on one Side, and more Re&s;pect on
<PB N="20" REF="56">
the other, which is more likely to make Friend|&s;hip la&s;ting than that Freedom and Equality, which is generally between male Friends. This <HI>Platonick</HI> Love, which I am de&s;cribing, is of the Nature of that Affection, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between Father and Daughter, Brother and Si&s;ter, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch a guardian Benevolence on one Side, and &s;uch a Gratitude on the other, as makes the mo&s;t charming Society in the World.</P>
<P>Recant, thou Prophane! nor offend me again, by &s;o much as hinting at that Love, which is independent of Friend&s;hip. <HI>Adieu.</HI></P>

<P>You call my la&s;t Letter unrea&s;onable and unkind, and &s;ay you are preparing the Willow. If to e&s;teem you with unwearied Con&s;tancy, and to pre&s;erve the &s;tronge&s;t Friend&s;hip for you, even tho' you do not merit it, can be called unkind (tho' I acknowledge it to be unrea&s;on|able) I &s;hall then own your Charge is ju&s;t.

<P>YOU began your la&s;t with a Quotation which aptly de&s;cribes the Life, we have led for &s;ome Time pa&s;t; but that I think our's is more unaccountable; for, tho' a <HI>Dog</HI> and <HI>Cat</HI> begin with Squabbling, yet U&s;e &s;oon reconciles them to each other; and I have &s;een them, in a &s;hort Time, quietly occupy each a Chimney-Corner, as becomes dome&s;tick Animals to do. While, on the contrary, we met, at fir&s;t with that mutual Love and good Liking, which might promi&s;e a long and con&s;tant Harmony; yet were not one Month acquainted, before <HI>Pu&s;s,</HI> in her Maje&s;ty, had her Back up, and <HI>Curr</HI> fell a Snarling, as if U&s;e, Habit, or Cu&s;tom, who&s;e con&s;tant Strife is again&s;t Nature, made a Sport of reconciling Antipathies, and de&s;troying Sym|pathies.</P>
<P>But, to quit this Allegory, I beg my Dear, you will con&s;ider, that I never reprimanded you for any Thing, but what I thought &s;ome Injury to your Fortune, Character, or Health; mo&s;tly the La&s;t; for the Fir&s;t is too &s;mall for Oeco|nomy, and the Second too good for Scandal. But you are con&s;tantly complaining of bad Health, and yet always doing the very Things which de&s;troy it; you are eternally taking Me|dicines,
<PB N="47" REF="83">
and, at the &s;ame Time, doing irregular Things, to prevent their Operation. Now it is probable that there are but few Drugs in an Apothecary's Shop, which may be &s;aid, if they do no Good, to do no Harm; &s;o that you may find the be&s;t Medicines, without a Regimen, turn to Poi&s;on; and, tho' frequent Parties to <HI>Ranelagh</HI> may be extremely agreeable to the Rules of a Novel,&mdash;they are, I a&s;&s;ure you, quite contrary to the Laws of Phy&s;ick.

<P>If, from all the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions, I &s;hould endeavour to exert, perhaps, a little too rough|ly, the Power and Influence I thought I had over you, and which I never will make U&s;e of, but for your own Advantage, I was in Hopes of having the Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing calmly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately con&s;idered, and ex|pected your Thanks (tho' I acted not on &s;o poor a Motive) rather than your Re&s;entment.</P>

<P>At &s;ome Di&s;tance from this Town, I amu&s;ed my&s;elf with one of the mo&s;t curious Pieces of exqui&s;ite bad Ta&s;te, I have ever met with; and which put me in Mind of that Epi&s;tle of <HI>Pope</HI>'s which we read together, the other Evening.

<PB N="50" REF="86">
unnatural Plea&s;ures, I mentioned to you lately, with which the Daemon of <HI>Caprice</HI> has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the human Brutes of this World.

The only Thing, which can recommend, in &s;uch Pieces, is, their being well drawn; but this only renders them &s;till more &s;hocking, as a bad Man needs but Sen&s;e and Courage, to be a Devil.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome much admired Pa&s;&s;ages in Poetry, which I am di&s;&s;atisfied with, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on; and that a Reli&s;h for &s;uch Things is an In&s;tance of fal&s;e Ta&s;te, I think may be deduced from this one Reflection, that Provi|dence

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> PAUPER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your pretty lively Letter, and am now &s;et down to con&s;ider of the Que&s;|tion you &s;tarted in Natural Philo&s;ophy, relating to Fools.</P>
<P>As Nature is &s;aid, to have made nothing in vain, what Apology then for Fools? This Difficulty, which has &s;o long puzzled the Learn|ed,
<PB N="56" REF="92">
I will offer you two Solutions to an&s;wer; one by denying, and the other, by admitting the Fact.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then I deny that Nature ever made a Fool, but as &s;he makes any other Mon&s;ter; not by De&s;ign, but thro' &s;ome accidental Imper|fection in the Organs of Conception, or ca&s;ual Event, happening afterwards to the Infant in the Cradle.</P>
<P>Next, I admit Fools to have been made by De&s;ign, and, no Offence to you, &s;hall take the Liberty to offer you this Hypothe&s;is of the Matter.</P>
<P>Providence made Man; and, &s;eeing it not good, that Man &s;hould be alone, made Woman; then, &s;eeing it not good that Women &s;hould be alone, he made a Fool; before which Time, it is &s;aid &s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf with the Devil. From which Time Knaves and Fools have divided the Favours of the Fair.</P>
<P>Let me now attempt a Metaphy&s;ical Account of this extraordinary Matter, which has &s;o much &s;urprized natural Philo&s;ophers: That two Men, who have had the &s;ame Education, and, upon Di&s;&s;ection, have been found anatomically the &s;ame, have yet &s;o greatly differed in their Under&s;tanding. For this, &s;ee the <HI>Metemp&s;icho&s;is,</HI> on Tran&s;migration of Souls, according to <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Account of it. He &s;ays, in the &s;ixth <HI>Aeneid,</HI> that the Souls of tho&s;e who die, return to this
<PB N="57" REF="93">
World again to animate other human Bodies; except &s;uch as, having compleatly acquitted them&s;elves on Earth, remain in <HI>Ely&s;ium</HI> for ever. Now, &s;ince as many, or more, are born, as die; therefore, it is nece&s;&s;ary to create a Num|ber of new Souls, to &s;upply the Place of tho&s;e, who have fini&s;hed their Cour&s;e. Thus I con|clude, that what is &s;tiled Sen&s;e, or Parts, in Men, is, but a Recollection of former Experience; and their having no Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this Matter, need be no Objection to the Truth of it; for Men have often, in their Sleep, exerci&s;ed the Arts, they have been bred to, without any Re|collection of their former Practice. The Fools then of this World, I take to be &s;ome of tho&s;e new-fa&s;hioned Souls, occa&s;ionally created, who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s thro' an Infancy of three-&s;core Years, and be re-born to every Stage of human Life, before they can arrive at an adult Under&s;tanding, and find Re&s;t for their Souls in <HI>Ely&s;ium.</HI></P>

<P>DOST thou expect to live, after all this prophane Sarca&s;m again&s;t Women? Or do you hope that <HI>He&s;iod</HI> or <HI>Orpheus</HI> were to be the la&s;t Sacrifices to Female Ju&s;tice?

<Q>in all the learned Languages, the moral Excellencies were Nouns of the feminine Gender.</Q>

<P>But, not to in&s;i&s;t on any Superiority in this Matter, would it not be cruel and prophane to &s;uppo&s;e that the Creator &s;hould require as great Virtues from us, and &s;ubject us to as &s;e|vere Trials, as Men, without in&s;piring our Minds with equal Strength, or making our Souls capable of as high moral Perfection?</P>
<P>Your own Reading can furni&s;h you with In|&s;tances in Women, of every manly Virtue, even of per&s;onal Courage, and Contempt of Death; &s;ufficient to prove the Force of my Rea&s;oning; which, however, I &s;hall not enume|rate, le&s;t, my Memory failing me, you &s;hould pertly &s;ay, the&s;e Examples were but ju&s;t &s;uffi|cient to e&s;tabli&s;h the contrary Rule, by their Exceptions to it.

<P>Now even tho&s;e few extraordinary Examples, which you all admit of, &s;ufficiently prove, or declare, the original Excellence of our Natures; for Rea&s;on, or Philo&s;ophy, may perfect Virtue, but cannot create it; tho' a narrow and illiberal Education may &s;o depre&s;s and ob&s;cure great Qualities, as to give that paltry Tenour to our Characters, which you &s;o unfairly reproach us with;&mdash;which brings me to the &s;econd Part of my Propo&s;ition, and which, according to your Example, I &s;hall make the Subject of a &s;econd Letter;&mdash;&s;o a Truce, 'till next Po&s;t, but no Peace, 'till you are fairly conquered.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XL.</HEAD>
<P>IN antient Times, when Mankind began to frame them&s;elves into Societies and States, the male Part, perceiving they were born with greater bodily Strength, than the Female, vainly concluded, they were originally indued with greater Sen&s;e and nobler Souls, &s;o, partially arrogated to them&s;elves the Superiority; at the &s;ame Time, that they refu&s;ed, very unfairly, the &s;ame Law of Rea&s;on, to an Hor&s;e, though they acknowledge him to be an Animal of greater Strength, than they.</P>
<P>Now, in order to pre&s;erve this unju&s;t Domi|nion to them&s;elves, and their Heirs Male for ever, they concluded no <HI>Salique</HI> Law &s;o effec|tual, as to fetter and in&s;lave our Minds, by &s;uch a narrow, dome&s;tick, and partial Education, as &s;hould bury the Seeds of Sen&s;e and Philo&s;ophy, and bya&s;s our Opinions towards a Notion of their &s;uperior, "manly Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on."</P>
<P>Thus un-educated, and un-improved; or, what is wor&s;e, condemned to a wrong Educa|tion; it is as unfair to cen&s;ure us for the Weak|ne&s;s of our Under&s;tandings, as it would be to blame the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Women for little Feet; for neither is owing to the Imperfection of Nature, but to the Cruelty of Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>When Women then a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves with Men of moderate Under&s;tandings (for I
<PB N="63" REF="99">
think you too humble, when you brand tho&s;e with the Title of Fools, who fall &s;hort of your own Sen&s;e) it is only becau&s;e it is natural and rea&s;onable to prefer that Degree of Sen&s;e, which they comprehend, to that which is be|yond their Apprehen&s;ion, and this is nothing more than you would do your&s;elf; for I do not know, what Plea&s;ure you could have, in Com|pany with a <HI>Rabbi,</HI> merely for his under&s;tanding <HI>Hebrew,</HI> of which you hardly know the Type.</P>
<P>I believe that Women, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> as <HI>Tom</HI> &s;ays, always prefer Men of the be&s;t Sen&s;e, as far as the Limits of their own Under&s;tanding extend; beyond which, it would be Enthu&s;ia&s;m, not rational Affection, to carry their Regards. I confe&s;s indeed that there mu&s;t be an intire Equality between the Rivals, with regard to Fortune, Titles, Dre&s;s, Per&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;before the Superiority of Under&s;tanding can have the Chance of being con&s;idered. But then this is owing to the fal&s;e Bya&s;s of female Education, which directs us to wrong Means of Happine&s;s; and, in&s;tead of being cen&s;ured for our Error, we ought to be pitied for not being rendered capable of judging right.</P>
<P>Henceforward therefore, I interdict you, wi&s;e Fools, from the Unju&s;tne&s;s of any Satyr again&s;t our Sex, 'till you have, by a proper and more liberal Education, given our noble and inge|nuous Natures fair Play to exert them&s;elves.

<P>I &s;hall mention but one Thing more, which appears to me a very natural Thought; that Providence certainly intended Women, rather than Men, for the Study and Contemplation of Philo&s;ophy and &s;cientifick Knowledge; as the Delicacy of our Frame &s;eems fitter for Specula|tion, than Action; and our Home-province af|fords us greater Lei&s;ure, than Men, who, from their robu&s;t and active Natures, &s;eem calcu|lated more for Bu&s;ine&s;s, Labour, and mecha|nick Arts.

<Q>Since Satyrizing tho&s;e, is, Prai&s;ing you.</Q>

<P>For my Part, I declare, that, in general, I both like and e&s;teem Women better than Men; they often excite the Exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t plea|&s;ing Virtues, Genero&s;ity, Honour, and Com|pa&s;&s;ion, they in&s;pire us with the whole

<P>I never feel my&s;elf intirely chearful, but in their Company; for Sprightline&s;s and good Humour more particularly become you, than us; as your gayer and more poetical Reading, with almo&s;t an intire Vacation from Bu&s;ine&s;s, enable you better to exert them: In &s;hort, what was &s;aid of Mu&s;ick, may very ju&s;tly be applied to your Sex:

<P>Your Virtues al&s;o are more con&s;tant and perfect than our's, as they flow from a natural Delicacy of Sentiment, a cha&s;te Education, and a more implicit Sen&s;e of Religion, while our Morals, being fir&s;t ob&s;cured by a libertine Youth, are to be brought to Light by the La|bour of Thought and Reflection; then pa&s;s thro' the Hands of Legi&s;lators, who &s;o mix and blend them with human Policies, that the very Spirit is evaporated; or el&s;e they are &s;o &s;ubti|lized by the Refinements of the Philo&s;ophers, that the intire Sub&s;tance of Virtue is de&s;troyed.</P>

<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from performing my u&s;ual <HI>Ambarvalia</HI> in the Morning; and have rou&s;ed all my Labourers to Work, except tho&s;e who are ill; whom I have vi&s;ited, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted both with Advice and Money. Sometimes,

In &s;hort, I have often looked upon early Hours to be as nece&s;&s;ary to Virtue, as they are to Health; for I believe mo&s;t Men are wicked, rather for Want of Reflection, than Want of Principle; and the charming Lei&s;ure, which Ri&s;ing early affords for Contemplation, I take to be a great Help towards the Improve|ment both of Morals and Religion. How na|tural is true Devotion, when the Mind is at Liberty to reflect, with Gratitude and Admira|tion, upon the Bounties and Beauties of Provi|dence! and I am very &s;ure that the Seducer has infinitely more Power over a Man immer&s;ed in the World, than over one who has &s;ecluded him|&s;elf from it; in&s;omuch, that I never knew a very contemplative Man, a wicked one, &s;ince I have been capable to ob&s;erve upon the Manners of Mankind.

<P>YOUR Thoughts upon the Nature and Pa&s;|&s;ion of Re&s;entment, are philo&s;ophical and ingenious, and are wrote with that &s;en&s;ible Calmne&s;s, which I always admire in you; tho' I am &s;ometimes provoked at it. In &s;hort, I have often thought it was your peculiar Happine&s;s to have been ble&s;&s;ed, by Providence, with a Judgment to direct you right, and an Heart to
<PB N="80" REF="116">
pur&s;ue its Dictates; for you really do not &s;eem to be born with a Spirit &s;ufficient to actuate your Virtue without it.</P>
<P>But, in An&s;wer to your la&s;t Letter, I think, I may ob&s;erve this, that you &s;eem rather to argue again&s;t the Pa&s;&s;ion of Anger, than the Principle of Revenge. That we are to &s;ubmit to the Vici&s;&s;itudes of Fortune, with Chearful|ne&s;s and Re&s;ignation, as they are pre&s;umed to be the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, who knows both what we are able, and what it may be for our Advantage to bear, is a Point we are both agreed in; but, whether we are to look upon tho&s;e Misfortunes, which proceed from the Ingratitude, Perver&s;ene&s;s, Envy, Hatred, or Malice of Mankind, as the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of Providence, &s;o as to con&s;ider our Enemies as evil Agents, directed to good Purpo&s;es, as Di|vines tell us is &s;ometimes the Ca&s;e, is a Doc|trine, which does not appear quite &s;o plau&s;ible to my Under&s;tanding. Why may we not &s;up|po&s;e, that human Frailty, or the In&s;tigation of the Devil, &s;ometimes prompts Men to Enmity with their Fellow-creatures; tempting them to communicate &s;ome Portion of that Mi&s;ery to others, which the evil Spirit of Mi&s;chief tor|ments their own Hearts with? In this Ca&s;e then, I look upon Revenge to be not only Natural, but Moral too; for the Di&s;appoint|ment of Malice, or the Retorting of it with
<PB N="81" REF="117">
Vengeance, is a more likely Method of curing the vicious Habit, than Non-re&s;i&s;tance and For|givene&s;s, which but nouri&s;h the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Your Sentiment,
<Q>That we &s;hould behave well to our Friends out of Love, and to our Enemies out of Picque,</Q>
is certainly very noble; but give me leave to ob&s;erve, that this is but a partial Virtue, as it regards intirely our own Advantage, but tends not to the Reforma|tion of another's Manners. This may have an Effect, perhaps, upon &s;ome ingenuous Natures, but of &s;uch our late Letters have not been con|ver&s;ant; and, in Truth, they are &s;o few, that this can only be con&s;idered as a particular, not a general Rule.</P>
<P>I may be wrong in my Opinion, but Nature never errs; and, as the Brute Creation is in|&s;pired with &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, we may &s;tile it the &s;econd Principle, as Self-pre&s;ervation is the Fir&s;t; and I dare &s;ay, that <HI>Seneca,</HI> dying in the Bath, would have &s;miled, in his la&s;t Moments, to have &s;een <HI>Nero</HI> pale and breathle&s;s at his Feet. Perhaps too, it was &s;ome Idea of Re|venge on <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> that prompted <HI>Cato</HI> to put him&s;elf to Death (otherwi&s;e he acted very un|accountably) to di&s;appoint the Conqueror's Tri|umph, and to draw off the Acclamations of the World, in &s;ecret Murmurs, at their Hero's Fate. However, to compound this Di&s;pute upon Revenge, I will agree with you, that, as a Pa&s;|&s;ion,

it is a Vice, provided you will admit, that, as a Principle, it may be a Virtue.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I RECEIVED two Letters from you, la&s;t Po&s;t, of different Dates; and find you are returning again to the <HI>Melpomene</HI> Strain, and are as great a Riddle as ever. You trifle with your&s;elf very idly; for &s;ure, if Life is not worth your Care, Health is. I felt your Di&s;|order, before I heard of it; for I have been in the &s;ame Way, my&s;elf, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t. I am &s;orry to find the Sympathy of our Bodies &s;o great&mdash;at this Di&s;tance&mdash;but, I find, the Sphere of your Activity is very exten&s;ive; nay, more powerful than any of the fixed Stars; be|cau&s;e you can influence, as far as you are capa|ble of being contemplated. But, no more of your malign A&s;pects; and I beg that all your future Letters may be wrote in a chearful Strain, tho' it &s;hould be even a <HI>Strain</HI> to you;&mdash;forgive the Quibble, &mdash;for, be a&s;&s;ured, that nothing keeps off either natural or moral Evils, &s;o well, as Chearfulne&s;s, &s;omebody calls it,
<Q>the Health of Virtue.</Q>
And I will not venture to carry it &s;o far as to pronounce, that a Man, who is not chearful; is either a Knave, or a Fool. Take Notice that all Di&s;tempers &s;ooner &s;eize on us, when we are low-&s;pirited; and all ill Luck,
<PB N="90" REF="126">
and Misfortunes, afflict the coward Mind, more than the Brave. Chearfulne&s;s I take to be the be&s;t Hymn we can offer up to our Creator, as it &s;hews Gratitude and Acquie&s;cence; while Melancholy betrays Repining, and De&s;pair at the Ways and Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence. It is a Degree of the greate&s;t Crime Man can be guilty of, Suicide, and the greate&s;t Degree of it too; for Deliberation is the highe&s;t Aggrava|tion of a Crime.</P>
<P>One of the &s;tronge&s;t Articles of Guilt too, in&s;tanced in the Crime I mention, is, the de|priving the Society of a Member; by how much more then the Victim's Merit is, by &s;o much greater mu&s;t the De&s;troyer's Sin be.&mdash;Think of this and tremble.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE you have, before this, received my congratulatory Epi&s;tle, on the Day that gave you Birth; and, I think, I ought to con|dole with you now, for having entered into the old-fa&s;hioned Scheme of Hou&s;e-keeping. I thank you for your obliging Wi&s;h, but am angry with you for &s;u&s;pecting that I &s;hould be
<PB N="91" REF="127">
tired of the Place, for I could &s;ay, with <HI>Cowley,</HI>
<Q><L>With thee, for ever, I in Woods could re&s;t,</L>
<L>Where never human Foot the Ground has pre&s;t:</L>
<L>Thou, from all Shades, the Darkne&s;s can'&s;t exclude,</L>
<L>And from a De&s;ert bani&s;h Solitude.</L></Q></P>
<P>So much by Way of An&s;wer to the civil Part of your Letter; but, I confe&s;s, I am quite at a Lo&s;s to know what Return to make to the Remainder of it. I have &s;o often &s;poke my Sentiments, upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, that I have &s;carce any Thing left to &s;ay, but Repetitions; which I am not fond of, upon &s;o ungrateful a Subject.</P>
<P>If I knew any Method to convince you I am &s;erious, and re&s;olved in what I &s;ay, I would, upon my Honour, attempt it with the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure, tho' it were parting with a Limb; as it would thenceforward &s;ave you a great deal of needle&s;s Trouble, and me from a World of Anxiety and Mortification. This might, per|haps, give &s;uch a Turn to your Regards for me, as I could wi&s;h; or prevent your ever thinking of me at all; even which I &s;hould prefer to your thinking of me as you do. I &s;hould then be at Liberty to love you, without hating my&s;elf; becau&s;e I &s;hould then have an E&s;teem for you, which might ju&s;tify my Pa&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="92" REF="128">
I &s;hall only add, that, if you have a Mind to convince me you de&s;ire either to &s;ee, or hear from me again, you will never mention &s;o un|kind, &s;o ungenerous, and &s;o unmannerly a Sub|ject more; for I &s;hall never an&s;wer another Letter of your's, wrote in &s;uch a Stile; which, if you &s;ometimes u&s;e, to &s;hew your Wit, you have no Excu&s;e for, as your Fund does not re|quire the Aid of Libertini&s;m.</P>
<P>That I do love you, I own, and confe&s;s it more freely, &s;ince I find I have, thank God, &s;ufficient Strength to acknowledge it with Safety; for, I am glad to find, I do not love you better than my&s;elf; and, tho' I would chearfully &s;a|crifice all that is peri&s;hable of me, for your Happine&s;s, I &s;hall take Care to pre&s;erve that Part of me, which may make you, at &s;ome Time of your Life, not a&s;hamed of having loved me. In &s;hort, if you bear any Affinity to that Omnipotence which accepts a contrite Heart, you cannot meet a more &s;incere De|votee; but, if you are like one of tho&s;e Hea|then Deities, which required an human Sacri|fice, I declare, I have no Offering for your Altar.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' you have ventured upon that &s;ame Subject again, yet you have done it with &s;o much Addre&s;s, that I need not hold any Re|&s;olution of not an&s;wering your Letter. The &s;udden Change in your Morals, I confe&s;s, &s;ur|prizes me; but too prompt Converts, they &s;ay, are &s;eldom &s;incere; and it mu&s;t be a Goo&s;e indeed, that is not aware, when a Fox preaches.</P>
<P>Now, I think, even your former Letter more tolerable than this; for there you declared open War, here you would circumvent; and it would humour my Pride, rather to be over|powered, than to be over-reached. What you propo&s;e, would do well enough for a Woman, who only waited for an Excu&s;e: But, in my Opinion, this would only mend the Matter, like Hypocri&s;y added to Vice; or, at be&s;t, a Sort of don't know, as it were, neither this, nor that, nor one, nor t'other, nor good, nor bad; but hanging, like <HI>Era&s;mus</HI>'s Paradi&s;e, be|tween Heaven and Hell; without Vice enough to repent of, or Virtue &s;ufficient to boa&s;t of.&mdash; Away, away &mdash; I'll ha' none on't, I'll ha' none on't.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="130">I am not &s;o unrea&s;onable to take it ill, that you do not offer what, I know, is not, at pre|&s;ent, within your Power and Prudence; but, I have really great Rea&s;on to re&s;ent, that you &s;hould attempt to offer me any Thing &s;hort of it.</P>
<P>You rally me, very unfairly, upon what you call my <HI>Platonicks</HI>: For, I never pretended to carry Affectation to &s;uch a ridiculous Length; &s;o that I only declare my&s;elf a <HI>Platonick</HI> in Vir|tue, not in Romance.</P>
<P>Your Scheme is, perhaps, a very plau&s;ible one for the World, if I &s;hould have Occa&s;ion
<Q>To tell them by and by, how the Rogue &s;erved me.</Q></P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding, there is wanting to me a certain Self-conviction, without which, all your Sen&s;e and Logick &s;erve only to puzzle the Will, not to determine it.</P>
<P>You have, without Doubt, a very extraor|dinary Art, which I never perceived in any other Per&s;on, and which it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe without a Paradox; it is a Faculty of convincing the Rea&s;on, without &s;atisfying the Mind. I know, before-hand, your ready An&s;wer to this, that it &s;hews People's Preju|dices &s;tronger than their Rea&s;on: But be it &s;o, for me,&mdash;when Prejudices are on the &s;afe Side, it is a Virtue to li&s;ten to them; and I have ju&s;t now luckily recollected an admira|ble
<PB N="95" REF="131">
Sentiment, I heard you once quote, from &s;ome antient Ethicks,
<Q>That we &s;hould never venture upon any Action, where we have the lea&s;t Doubt about its being hone&s;t or di&s;ho|ne&s;t; for this very Doubt declares, at lea&s;t, our own innate Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s about it, which is higher, and prior to Logick and Ca&s;ui&s;try.</Q>
This, and &s;uch other good Things, has my dear <HI>Harry</HI> often &s;aid, read, and wrote to me; for, when you are not on your Guard, I have often <HI>detected</HI> you to be a Man of Honour and Virtue; and, whenever you appear otherwi&s;e, I am convinced that it is more the Vice of the Times, than of the Man; which was the Apology made for the Puns of <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI>&mdash; Indeed, I tremble often, to think how my dear <HI>Harry</HI> may be "beaten with many Stripes."</P>
<P>I have burned your la&s;t, and former Letter, upon this Subject; le&s;t they &s;hould ever happen to appear, to the Di&s;advantage of your Cha|racter, or to the Prejudice of mine.</P>
<P>I would have pre&s;erved the Wit of them, if I had been Chymi&s;t enough to &s;eparate the Gold from the Dro&s;s; but they peri&s;hed toge|ther in the Flames, the natural Con&s;equence of keeping bad Company.</P>

For, as to &s;ubdue our Pa&s;|&s;ions is the End of all Philo&s;ophy, he gave the highe&s;t Proof of having reduced his to a perfect Calm, when he was content with &s;o trifling an Employment as Fiddling with his Cat. How|ever I have yet one Doubt, which po&s;&s;ibly may derogate from his Merit, whether he had not pa&s;&s;ed his grand Climacteric, before he found out this charming Amu&s;ement. I have often been delighted with him, even when I was a Child, for remarking,
<Q>That there is a certain general Claim of Kindne&s;s and Benevolence, which every Species of Creatures has a Right to from us.</Q>
And think it much to be regretted, that this generous Maxim is not more attended to, in the Affair of Education; for this Rea&s;on, I admire you for endeavouring to obtain the be&s;t Advice you can, for the Recovery of your Fa|vourite's Health; &s;ince the mo&s;t refined Philo|&s;ophy allows that we have Rea&s;on to believe the
<PB N="106" REF="142">
Sen&s;ations of &s;mall Animals and In&s;ects are, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, as exqui&s;ite as tho&s;e of Creatures of far more inlarged Dimen&s;ions: My darling <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;eems to be of this Opinion, when he &s;ays,
<Q>The poor Beetle that we tread upon, in corp'ral Sufferance, feels a Pang as great, as when a Giant dies.</Q>
But what amazes me is, that you, who love Retirement &s;o much, have not found out a more rational Companion than your Cat; for I am of <HI>Bal&s;ac</HI>'s Opinion,
<Q>Que la &s;olitude e&s;t certainement une belle cho&s;e. Mais il y a plai&s;ir d'avoir quelqu'un, qui en &s;&ccedil;ache repondre, a qui on pui&s;&s;e dire, de tems en tems, que la &s;olitude e&s;t une belle cho&s;e.</Q>
&mdash;But I mu&s;t not forget, that, as I often wi&s;h for your Company, you may as often wi&s;h to be alone, and that I may perhaps be, at this In&s;tant, breaking in upon one of tho&s;e Hours, which you de&s;ire to enjoy without In|terruption.

<HEAD>LETTER LXV. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Am not at all &s;urprized at your Story of Mrs. &mdash;'s &s;econd Failure; for indeed I am not apt to be &s;urprized, when I hear of &s;uch Things at the fir&s;t. This is not owing to any &s;light Opinion I have of Women, but to the Knowledge I have of human Nature, which, with my Ob&s;ervation upon the carele&s;s and im|proper Education given to mo&s;t young Women, gives me rather frequent Surprize, that we do not more often hear Stories of this Kind.</P>
<P><HI>Rochfaucault,</HI> who is a &s;evere Morali&s;t, as mo&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> are, &s;ays,
<Q>There are many Wo|men, who never had an <HI>Affair,</HI> but there ne|ver was a Woman, who had but <HI>one:</HI></Q>
Which &s;hews, that he thought the fir&s;t Step the only Difficulty. Yet I have known &s;ome devout Sinners, who, tho' not able to defend them&s;elves, while yet in a State of Innocence, vainly imagine to recover Virtue from their Fall; like the Fa|ble of <HI>Antaeus,</HI> who is &s;aid to have gained fre&s;h Strength, when <HI>Hercules</HI> threw him on the Ground. <HI>Ovid</HI> is &s;evere too on this Subject, "Lae&s;a pudicitia e&s;t, deperit illa &s;emel:" Which Pa&s;&s;age is too gro&s;ly tran&s;lated, to be quoted here. <HI>Rowe</HI> has a &s;trong Line in his <HI>Shore:</HI>
<Q>They &s;et, like Stars which fall to ri&s;e no more.</Q>
<PB N="112" REF="148">
However I do not judge &s;o hardly, in this Mat|ter, as the Generality of People do: I agree with them indeed that, when Women fail from Wantone&s;s, or Vice, it is very probable they may &s;in on to the End of Life; but a Woman may be overcome &s;o many other Ways, Exce&s;s of Love, too great Confidence in the Lover's Ho|nour, circumvented by Fraud, or overpowered by Surprize, that an Adventure of this Kind does not always betoken a Failure in Virtue; and a Per&s;on, injured in any of the&s;e Ways, may po&s;&s;ibly recover Strength from their Misfortunes, as a Bone is &s;aid to knit firmer in the broken Part than in the &s;ound.</P>
<P>The Story you tell me of &mdash; &s;urprizes me more than the other, tho' it is of a Piece with his known Character; for, of all human Vices, Avarice a&s;toni&s;hes me mo&s;t, as it appears to me the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable, and unnatural too. I &s;hould think, that Mi&s;ers may turn Prodigals, upon this Principle, that they may do &s;o without Co&s;t; for he who &s;pends his own Fortune, cer|tainly lives at the Expence of his Heir.</P>
<P>You are welcome to buy the Books you men|tion for me; for, tho' I have read them before, I think they will not di&s;grace my Study; and this will give you an Opportunity of reading them your&s;elf.</P>

<P>I AM extremely angry at Mrs. &mdash;, for mi&s;repre&s;enting the Story you allude to: I &s;aid indeed the Words to her, and quoted them from a &s;prightly Lady of my Acquaintance, but mentioned no Name; and, as there was certain|ly Wit in them, &s;he might probably attribute them to you, and meant to compliment you, with &s;uppo&s;ing you the Author. It was Mrs. &mdash; who made U&s;e of tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, on the Oc|ca&s;ion I told her. I declare, that, in any Part, either of our Conver&s;ation or Corre&s;pon|dence, I never remember you to have u&s;ed any Expre&s;&s;ion,
<Q>le&s;s mode&s;t than the Speech of <HI>Prudes,</HI></Q>
or to have hinted, or even &s;eemed to reli&s;h the lea&s;t double Entendre; and I a&s;&s;ure you, I have often wondered, that a Per&s;on, who has as much Wit, Spirit, and Wildne&s;s in her Imagination, as any one I know, &s;hould have, in Reality, more Delicacy in her Senti|ments, and more Decency in her Expre&s;&s;ions, than I ever met with in any other Woman.</P>
<P>It is upon this Account, that I give you the Credit of more Wit, than other Women; as that Beauty mu&s;t have greater Charms, who
<PB N="114" REF="150">
plea&s;es a Man, when &s;he is cloathed, than are nece&s;&s;ary to move him, when &s;he is naked.</P>
<P>But indeed, I think, in general, that, when Lewdne&s;s, or Prophanene&s;s, are called in, as Helps to Wit, they but betray the Weakne&s;s of it; as narrow Waters mark their Limits, by expo&s;ing the Shallows.</P>

<P>I RECEIVED yours this Morning, and do a&s;&s;ure you, without Compliment, that it wanted nothing, but your being in the Right, to be the be&s;t wrote Letter I ever read. I com|mend every Thing, but the Inju&s;tice of it; like a certain Exile from <HI>Athens,</HI> who could not for|bear applauding, and repeating to Strangers, an Oration of <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> by which the Wretch was bani&s;hed. The Cau&s;e of many of our Quarrels has been owing, as at pre&s;ent, to your never con&s;idering any Thing, but the Matter before you. When you receive my Letters, you find &s;ome Things to di&s;plea&s;e you; but never recollect your own, which gave the Provoca|tion.

Con&s;ider that the Height of our Picques is, always, in Proportion to our Love; and, if &mdash; had charged me with all the cruel Things you did, I &s;hould not have offended her, by any Reply, incon&s;i&s;tent with the natural Com|plai&s;ance I have for even the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable of your Sex.

&s;hort, by an&s;wering me, you was only in Je&s;t. The&s;e Things are certainly incon&s;i&s;tent, at lea&s;t; and &s;urely, if you had reflected the lea&s;t on them, when you &s;ay,

I am per&s;uaded, you would have been generous, and ingenuous enough to acknowledge, I had good Rea&s;on to be provoked at being puzzled by contradictory Appearances, and je&s;ted with, in Matters, which both mortified and alarmed me.

<P>I realy think you have many valuable Qua|lities, and a great Number of agreeable ones; and I have been always endeavouring to &s;creen them, from &s;ome irregular Flights, and roman|tick Whims, which are, by no Means, any Ornament to your Under&s;tanding.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST Po&s;t I received a Letter from &mdash;, the An&s;wer of which he de&s;ires may be inclo&s;ed to you, becau&s;e, he &s;ays, you know where to direct to him. From which Hint I ga|ther two Things, both equally di&s;agreeable to me; that you corre&s;pond with him, and that he &s;till knows you write to me; and you know, it was without my Con&s;ent or Approbation, that he was, at fir&s;t, let into the Secret. That ei|ther of the&s;e Things gives me Offence, my dear <HI>Fanny,</HI> proceeds plainly from an high Sen&s;e of Honour, and a generous Regard for you. If I could ba&s;ely indulge a Vanity of this Kind, I do not know any Thing could an&s;wer the End &s;o well, as the letting your Corre&s;pondence with me be publicly known. That it was not, as I find now, a particular Favour to me, might in|deed humble the Vanity of it, but would not le&s;&s;en the Plea&s;ure; for I take this Opportunity to a&s;&s;ure you, that, tho' your Letters &s;hould come even, thro' the Pre&s;s, to my Hands, I do not know any Thing could give me a more agreeable Entertainment; and I &s;hould then only chide you, as <HI>Alexander</HI> did <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> for publi&s;h|ing his Works; becau&s;e what was before his
<PB N="124" REF="160">
particular Study, and the highe&s;t of his retired Plea&s;ures, more e&s;timable than all his Conque&s;ts, was then become common to all the World.</P>
<P>It is the Nature of Man to render him&s;elf often mi&s;erable, merely for the Vanity of being thought happy; but I declare, I would rather rejoice at being thought unhappy, than even &s;u&s;pected to be otherwi&s;e, at your lea&s;t Expence. If my Love, my Friend&s;hip, did not incline me to this, Honour, nay common Manhood, would require it from me, in the nice Circum&s;tances of our Loves, at pre&s;ent. My Character is Libertine, your Fortunes are &s;mall, your Experience of the World but little, your Age young, and your Guardian old. In &s;uch a Situation, you &s;hould take Care, not to tru&s;t to the charitable Opi|nion of the World, who will hardly be brought to believe, that either our Conver&s;ation, or our Corre&s;pondence, are upon &s;uch innocent Sub|jects, as in Truth they are; and if any Surmi&s;es &s;hould ari&s;e to the contrary, as I fear this Indi&s;|cretion with Regard to &mdash; (who&s;e Notions are not much out of the common Road of Things) may give Occa&s;ion for, it would not be in my Power to ju&s;tify you; nor indeed can any Thing a Man may &s;ay, or &s;wear, upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, either condemn, or acquit a Woman, in my Opinion; for, if he traduces her Character, I &s;hould think he might do &s;o as well out of Fal&s;|hood as Ba&s;ene&s;s; and, if he vindicates it, I
<PB N="125" REF="161">
might apprehend that he &s;hould do &s;o as well out of Honour as Truth. When I &s;ay, I am di&s;plea&s;ed with your writing to &mdash;, I am not jealous of your Love, but your Character, which I have very hone&s;t Rea&s;ons to be careful of. If you under&s;tand me right, in any Reproof I ever gave you, it would but improve your Love and E&s;teem for me; which will be a fair Return for that warm Pa&s;&s;ion and &s;incere Friend&s;hip, I, at pre&s;ent, feel toward my Heart's deare&s;t <HI>Fanny.</HI></P>

<P>MRS. &mdash;'s Behaviour will certainly con|firm the World's Opinion of her for &s;ome Time pa&s;t. True Virtue is mode&s;t in its Defence; but Frailty, like Cowardice, puts on the Air of a Bully, to di&s;gui&s;e its Weak|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="163">There is nothing which Women re&s;ent &s;o highly, as the free Manner, with which the World judge and &s;peak of their Actions.

<P>BECAUSE I cannot bear to have you re|main in a Mi&s;take, even in &s;o trifling a Matter, as any Thing mu&s;t be, which relates to me, I &s;hall trouble you with a few Remarks upon a late Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>You &s;urprized me extremely by &s;aying, that
<Q>a Heart, when <HI>broken,</HI> can with more Ea&s;e be divided,</Q>
and
<Q>a <HI>broken</HI> Looking-Gla&s;s reflects more Images, than a whole one,</Q>
are the &s;ame Thoughts. Now, I really think, a <HI>broken</HI> Pitcher is as like either of them, as they are the one to the other; for, having had the
<PB N="141" REF="181">
Misfortune to be <HI>broken,</HI> it agrees in the only Circum&s;tance common to them both.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve that mine is a Thought, <HI>Suckling</HI>'s only a Simile. If there was any Wit in mine, it is owing to it&s;elf alone; if there was any in his, it mu&s;t be owing to the Allu&s;ion; for there was certainly none in &s;aying, the Parts of a Thing are more in Number, than the Whole.</P>
<P>There was nothing alike even in the Occa|&s;ions of his Sentiment and mine: He, vile Libertine! meant, I &s;uppo&s;e, to apologize for his general Incon&s;tancy; I, like a &s;imple Swain, to a&s;&s;ert a double Con&s;tancy. Now, the Scope of <HI>Suckling</HI>'s Poem I know not, having never read any of his Works, but what I have met quoted; and, in general, few Per&s;ons have read le&s;s of polite Authors, than my&s;elf; there|fore I can only rea&s;on upon this Pa&s;&s;age, as I received it from you. Let us &s;ee then, &s;ince the Wit of it is denied, whether we can allow him even common Sen&s;e, in this Illu&s;tration of his. He tells his Mi&s;tre&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e, in Excu&s;e for his Incon&s;tancy, that her Cruelty, or his Exce&s;s of Love, has torn his tempe&s;t-beating Heart into &s;o many Pieces, that, like a broken Looking-Gla&s;s, it reflects more Objects, than when whole. Now I have &s;een Fragments of Mirrours &s;ometimes, which have indeed reflected my Image, (as whatever &s;hews me truly, mu&s;t, in your Opinion, be a <HI>Reflection</HI>;) but then they
<PB N="142" REF="182">
only multiplied the Object, not exhibited any new. Therefore, if the Simile had been ju&s;t, his broken Heart &s;hould rather have increa&s;ed his Con&s;tancy, by affording him more Frag|ments &s;u&s;ceptible of her Idea, as one may be &s;aid to multiply Life, by di&s;&s;ecting a Worm, becau&s;e each Part lives, tho', like a broken Heart, it lives in Pain. If indeed &s;he had ex|pre&s;&s;ed Surprize, that a wounded Heart &s;hould &s;till pre&s;erve its Con&s;tancy towards the Author of its De&s;truction, his Simile, tho' even here it would not come up to Wit, might make a pretty Glare among the <HI>Faux brilliant.</HI></P>
<P>He might &s;ay, perhaps, that the Fragments of a Looking-Gla&s;s may comprehend more Objects than one; but &s;ure a whole one is ca|pable of receiving more; therefore a Man, free from Love, may, and is more &s;u&s;ceptible of many Impre&s;&s;ions, than one, who has had the Misfortune of a broken Heart.</P>
<P>Now the Rea&s;on, I apprehend, of your charg|ing me with Plagiary, is this: <HI>Suckling</HI> you have admired, and, not finding either Sen&s;e or Wit in this Pa&s;&s;age, you had Rea&s;on to con|clude they were both &s;tolen; and, as I am a Per&s;on, who, in Wit, as well as Fortune, ap|pears to live above my Means, you had Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect me for the Theft.</P>

<P>YOU &s;ee my Impatience of writing to you, which does not wait for the Po&s;t, and has got the better of a hot, wet Day, bad Paper, Pens, and Ink; and a &s;trong Inclination to &s;leep, to pay me for la&s;t Night's Exce&s;s.</P>
<P>I hope you all got &s;afe to Town, and found your&s;elves all &s;afe in Town.

<P>I recant my Error, my deare&s;t <HI>Fanny,</HI> and here throw my Palinode at your Feet. That I was loved, let my Vanity now confe&s;s, which my Humility made me doubt before.

I thought it gro&s;s to Sen&s;e, that I &s;hould be capable of in&s;piring that &s;oft tender Pa&s;&s;ion; I thought it po&s;&s;ible indeed, I might gain a Friend, but never hoped to be able to win a Mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;o u&s;ed to flatter my&s;elf, as <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> does <HI>Pope,</HI> upon his Eclogues; that,

and allow what you have &s;ometimes &s;aid, that the natural Coquetry of her Di&s;po&s;i|tion, with a little Flight of Romance, by being indulged too far, had wrought upon her Mind the Semblance of a Pa&s;&s;ion, which exi&s;ted not in the Heart.
<Q>How cruel is Reflection after Pa&s;&s;ion? How different are the Points of Sight on the &s;ame Objects? Why is not Rea|&s;on &s;trong enough to keep her Throne, or &s;o intirely vani&s;hed, as never to re-a&s;&s;ume it?</Q>

But, tho' the Effects are equally vi&s;ible in us both, they are owing to very different Cau&s;es in each of us. The Fir&s;t proceeds, in him, from an <HI>habitual</HI> Di&s;regard to Women; (for I can never allow that to be natural to any Man:) In me, it proceeds from an Apprehen&s;ion of not meeting Succe&s;s with a Woman of Merit and Fortune; and, to take off the Merit of &s;uch Humility, I make my&s;elf Amends by the Pride of not hazarding a Refu&s;al.

<P>My Aunt is &s;till in the Country. I have been in the mo&s;t uncomfortable Way that ever was, &s;ince I came to Town. I have been much out of Order with a con&s;tant Pain in my Side, and living, as it were, on the Publick, without a Home.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> PET,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry for what you hint at, about Mrs. &mdash;; and can't help giving you a Speculation or two upon this Head, tho' you have forbidden me; ju&s;t to give you a little bet|ter Notion of the World, than you have at pre&s;ent; and in order al&s;o to make your Mind &s;omewhat ea&s;ier, with Regard to her Behaviour to you.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons, who &s;et up for Advi&s;ers, arrogate to them&s;elves Perfection; at lea&s;t, a high Prefe|rence to their Pupils; which, with Regard to her and you, would be Perfection. Now, as mo&s;t People's Pride is &s;uperior to their Friend|&s;hip, it is a great Humbling of one, to find the fancied Superiority not acknowledged, by the Coun&s;el not being regarded; and we would rather our Friends gained one Advantage by our Advice, than twenty by taking their own Way. Another Reflection to be con&s;idered is, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons, whom <HI>Will. Honeycomb</HI> calls the outrageou&s;ly virtuous, notwith&s;tanding their boa&s;ted Goodne&s;s, have at Heart a jealous Envy again&s;t tho&s;e, whom they &s;u&s;pect to have Sen&s;e, or Spirit enough to enjoy any Plea&s;ure, or make Advantage of any Occurrence of Life; which,
<PB N="159" REF="199">
perhaps, for Want of Sollicitation, proper Cir|cum&s;tance of Time, and Place, or more gene|rally, for Want of Courage, they may have mi&s;&s;ed them&s;elves. Ob&s;erve that I &s;peak all along in general Terms, of human Nature in general; for Mrs. &mdash; thinks &s;he has a great deal of Friend&s;hip for you, and I believe &s;he has. She may al&s;o imagine &s;he would rather lie in Mr. &mdash;'s Arms, than in the Em|braces of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and perhaps &s;he would; there are Enthu&s;ia&s;ms of all Kinds; and yet her Be|haviour to you may be fairly deduced from one or both of the general Reflections, ju&s;t mentioned, uncon&s;cious to her&s;elf; for it is not every Per&s;on, even of the be&s;t Sen&s;e, who acts, that knows from what Principle he acts. I could pur&s;ue this Subject a great deal farther, but &s;hall conclude it here, by a&s;&s;uring you &s;in|cerely, that you &s;hall for ever find, from my Be|haviour toward you, that I &s;hall endeavour to make you what Amends may be in my Power, for the Lo&s;s of a Friend, which, perhaps, I was the Occa&s;ion of. And here pray let me be vain enough to wi&s;h you Joy, as well as my&s;elf, up|on the Exchange; for both, it &s;eems, you could not have, thro' her Niggardline&s;s. Meer down|right Friend&s;hip is like a very moral Di&s;cour&s;e, which, if continued for any Time, is apt to grow lethargick; but Love, with Friend&s;hip mixed, is like a &s;en&s;ible Conver&s;ation enlivened
<PB N="160" REF="200">
by Sallies of Wit, which keeps us awake, dur|ing a very long Fea&s;t. In &s;hort, Friend&s;hip is the Enjoyment of Men, but Love, of Gods.

<P>THE Rea&s;on you did not, or perhaps may not for the Future, hear from me &s;o punctually, as in our former Corre&s;pondence, is, that I do not receive my Letters &s;o regularly now, as formerly; for, in &s;trict Obedience to your Commands, I have given Directions to the Po&s;t-ma&s;ter, not to give my Letters to any Per&s;on, but my&s;elf, or my Order; which occa|&s;ions &s;ome Delay, when I am at&mdash;, which is a great Way from the Po&s;t-Town.

I wi&s;h my <HI>Calphurnia</HI> would have better Dreams, for I have been, Thanks to you, my dear <HI>Hygea,</HI> in per|fect Health, &s;ince I &s;aw you; as the Recovery of your Love and Favour have fully re&s;tored

<Q><L>Since I am crept in Favour with my&s;elf,</L>
<L>I will maintain it, at &s;ome little Co&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have declared for A&s;&s;emblies here, and am "your only Jig-maker," to the A&s;toni&s;h|ment of all my Acquaintance. I be-beau'd my|&s;elf t'other Night, and went to a Ball; but &s;oon found out, that it was not the Amu&s;ement, I was in Que&s;t of. The Women, for who&s;e Sake alone I powdered, talked like Children, more in Simplicity, than Innocence; and were dre&s;&s;ed like Puppets, more &s;howy, than fine. However, this Tawdrine&s;s, tho' we may call it Poverty confe&s;&s;ed, does not offend me &s;o much as, what I have often &s;tiled, a Pedantry of Dre&s;s; which Per&s;ons of better Fortune, than Ta&s;te, are apt to run into. When I &s;ee any one dre&s;&s;ed very fine, without being genteel, I compare them to a Man of Learning, with|out Sen&s;e; which makes his Want of Un|der&s;tanding more con&s;picuous, as the Want of Ta&s;te is more manife&s;t in the other. With &s;uch Reflections as the&s;e, I &s;oon rendered my&s;elf un|fit for the gay Place I was in: So very quickly retired home, with this Ob&s;ervation, that the Joy, Happine&s;s, or Plea&s;ure, which elevates our Spirits, upon &s;ome Occa&s;ions, does not &s;upport us thro' every Scene, where Mirth is nece&s;&s;ary.
<PB N="166" REF="206">
The Gaiety of giddy Youth alone can be able to effect this; but, in all rational People, the Mirth or Chearfulne&s;s of mo&s;t Things mu&s;t flow from the particular Plea&s;ure, we find in the Things them&s;elves. Therefore I &s;hall never again mi&s;take that joyous Spirit, which the Thoughts of you rai&s;es in my Heart, for &s;uch a Lightne&s;s of Mind, as can make me revel in Balls and Ma&s;querades; but rather, what makes me more eminently unfit for &s;uch Amu&s;e|ments.</P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t and be&s;t-loved Love,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Manner of Writing, about my go|ing to <HI>London,</HI> charms me extremely, as it is very &s;en&s;ible and rational. It flatters me too, as it is &s;omewhat in the Stile I have al|ways treated you; for I would never &s;acrifice one Sentiment of Friend&s;hip to all the Extra|vagance of Love; for which Rea&s;on, to ordi|nary Seeming, I might, perhaps, appear not to have loved you, half as well, as I really did. However that may be, I do &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, upon my Word of Honour (which, when &s;eriou&s;ly given, I never forfeited to you yet) that, from the In&s;tant I fir&s;t &s;aw you here, I have loved and approved you better, than I ever did before; and &s;uch a Turn, at this Stage of our Acquaintance, is very likely to la&s;t for Life.&mdash; <HI>Amen,</HI> &s;o be it!</P>
<P>There is &s;omething, however, in your Man|ner, which &s;ometimes perplexes me. As for Example, in the two recent In&s;tances of <HI>Para|clete,</HI> and my going to <HI>London</HI>; you &s;peak of
<PB N="176" REF="216">
Things, which you &s;eem to de&s;ire, and, when I think you in Earne&s;t, as I generally do, my own Inclinations according with your's, you then tell me, you did not &s;eriou&s;ly intend what you hinted at. But I am not to be trifled with, after this Manner: For, whatever I undertake in Complai&s;ance to you, I &s;hall certainly go thro' with, in Compliance with my own Incli|nations. So I &s;hall certainly pay my Vi&s;it to you in <HI>London</HI> &s;oon, in Hope you will return the Compliment to <HI>Paraclete</HI> next Summer.</P>
<P>I hope you rejoice in the &s;ame Weather we have in the Country; we have not had even the Whi&s;per of a <HI>Michaelmas</HI> Rig yet; and <HI>October,</HI> which is generally a fine Month, is &s;etting in with all good Omens. There is &s;ome|thing more charming in a fine Sea&s;on, at this Time of the Year, than in all the Sun&s;hine of a Summer's Meridian. Methinks it affects us &s;omewhat like the plea&s;ing Reverence we feel, when we meet with Chearfulne&s;s in the Decline of Life. I hope this Weather will continue 'till I &s;ee you.&mdash;
<Q>Bear me but to her, then fail me, if you can.</Q>
Not that I am &s;uch a fair Weather Spark, that the Difference of Sea&s;on &s;hall make any Difference in my &s;tedfa&s;t Pur|po&s;e to &s;ee you, as &s;oon as I can;

<P>NEED I tell my dear <HI>Harry</HI> that his Letter gave me the highe&s;s Plea&s;ure, as the ut|mo&s;t Wi&s;h my Heart e'er formed, was to be approved by him? Let us now mutually con|gratulate each other, on our Coming to a right Under&s;tanding; for I am per&s;uaded that great Part of tho&s;e Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, we have both given, and received, have been owing to our not being thoroughly acquainted with the Motives, on which we &s;eparately acted. I may have mi&s;con|&s;trued Friend&s;hip into Want of Tenderne&s;s; and you deemed that Caprice, which was Ex|ce&s;s of Love. However, this I am &s;ure of, that we either love one another extremely well, or we mu&s;t be a Couple of the proude&s;t and mo&s;t ob&s;tinate Mortals, that ever yet exi&s;ted. I &s;incerely hope that our mutual Per&s;everance is owing to the fir&s;t Cau&s;e, as it is mo&s;t for the Honour of human Nature in general, and of us two in particular.</P>
<P>I am &s;incerely grateful for the kind A&s;&s;urance you give me of &s;till increa&s;ing Love. If every Thought, Word, or Action of my Life, being devoted to you, and you only, can merit a Con+tinuance of your Regard, I may venture to pro|mi&s;e, that it will la&s;t for Life; and
<Q>that our Loves and Comforts will increa&s;e, even as our Days do grow.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="218">As to that Part of my Conduct, which you &s;ay perplexes you, it is mighty ea&s;ily accounted for. I have, perhaps, more Romance in my Di&s;po&s;ition, than any Woman, you may have met with; for this Rea&s;on, my Mind is ever filled with Ideas out of the common Road; Whims, which have any Degree of Tender|ne&s;s, or Delicacy, plea&s;e me extremely, and I am apt to indulge them, perhaps, too much; but, when any Circum&s;tance recalls the Remem|brance of my Situation in Life, I am immedi|ately &s;orry for having given Way to my Folly, and would retrieve it, if I could. But, not to appear more variable than I really am, I &s;ubmit the Being, or Annihilation of <HI>Paraclete,</HI> intirely to you. If you &s;eriou&s;ly think, that my Aunt's Living there will add to your Happine&s;s, and not hurt my Fame, I will again, with Tran&s;port, indulge my Heart with
<Q><L>Tho&s;e Scenes of Bli&s;s my raptur'd Fancy fram'd,</L>
<L>In that dear Spot with Peace and thee retir'd;</L>
<L>Tho' Rea&s;on then my &s;anguine Fondne&s;s blam'd,</L>
<L>I'll &s;till adhere to what my Love in&s;pir'd.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t on your an&s;wering me like the Man of Honour, and the Friend. The Lover mu&s;t not have the &s;malle&s;t Part in your Reply.</P>
<P>I do indeed rejoice with you, and for you, on Account of the Weather. I never &s;ee a
<PB N="179" REF="219">
Gleam of Sun&s;hine, or a clear Sky, that does not afford me a double Plea&s;ure, by reflecting, how much you enjoy it. I would recommend it to you, to &s;tay in the Country, while the Weather holds good; a&s;&s;ured of this, that, when <HI>Sol</HI> withdraws his Influence, and refu&s;es longer to chear us mi&s;erable Mortals, you can more than &s;upply his Ab&s;ence, by clearing tho&s;e Glooms, which even his chearful Rays cannot di&s;pel without you.</P>
<P>I have &s;uch a violent Pain in my right Shoul|der, that it is with the utmo&s;t Difficulty I move my Hand to write. I am &s;till une pau|vre Solitaire; <HI>Kitty</HI> has not yet left <HI>Bond-Street,</HI> nor do I know when &s;he will.</P>
<P>If I were able, I would write another Letter, and not &s;end this; for it is indeed a mi&s;erable Scrawl; tho', as my Letters have been always Originals, not Copies, I think it would be ill-timed to begin with Forms, when I &s;hould leave them off.</P>
<P>As to the Affair of <HI>Nancy</HI> and <HI>Sally,</HI> it is of no farther Con&s;equence to me, than if <HI>James</HI> and the Coachman had been the Di&s;putants. Nor did I mention my Opinion of <HI>Sally</HI> with any De&s;ign; for you may ea&s;ily conceive, that it is a Matter of Indifference to me, whether your pre&s;ent Favourite was chri&s;tened <HI>Sarah,</HI> or <HI>Anne</HI>; &mdash;for, while I am in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Jewel that is lodged within, I care not who holds the Ca&s;ket.</P>

<P>YOU have di&s;tingui&s;hed very ju&s;tly about the Di&s;advantages, under which my Friend|&s;hip and your Love have hitherto appeared to each other; but they have both approved them|&s;elves of the be&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting Kind, upon the Te&s;ts I have often mentioned to you, that I &s;hould always pre&s;erve the &s;ame con&s;tant.

<L>Altho' it be not &s;hin'd upon;</L></Q>
and that, if you once truly loved me, whatever might happen in the Cour&s;e of our Lives, might, perhaps, interrupt, but could never break the Chain. Yet, to &s;ay the Truth, the&s;e converti|ble or reciprocal Terms of Love and Friend|&s;hip have been &s;o often commuted, converted, and compounded between us, that they are now
<PB N="181" REF="221">
become, according to a <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence, I have, <HI>unde ne&s;cio,</HI> met with,
<Q>Utrum horum mavis accipe, &s;ive utrumque;</Q>
and between us two have come to &s;o near a Re|&s;emblance to each other, that my Friend&s;hip, from a con&s;tant unallayed Heat, begins now to blaze into a Flame; and the Extravagance of your Pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems to have &s;pent it&s;elf to
<Q>The calm Lights of mild Philo&s;ophy;</Q>

<P>Your &s;aying that you rejoice now in fine Weather (tho' all Sea&s;ons are equal to tho&s;e who live in Town) becau&s;e you know the Plea|&s;ure I receive from it, in the Country, puts me in Mind of a Pair of romantic Lovers, who agreed, at Parting, that, at &s;uch an Hour of the Night, they would each take a &s;olitary Walk by Moonlight, enjoying a whim&s;ical Kind of Happine&s;s, in that they were both employed in contemplating the &s;ame Object, at the &s;ame Time.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have entered upon the Study you pre&s;cribed to me, and have read <HI>Tully</HI>'s <HI>Offices</HI> almo&s;t thro'; and I profe&s;s my&s;elf both plea&s;ed and &s;ur|prized, at finding to what a noble Height of virtuous Sentiment an uninlightened <HI>Pagan</HI> has carried the Point of Morals, Truth, and Ju&s;tice. There are &s;ome extreme nice Ca&s;es put, in dealing between Man and Man; in which <HI>Ci|cero</HI> has determined &s;o differently from the ge|neral Practice, and allowed Opinions of the mer|cantile World, that a Per&s;on mu&s;t have a very refined and ab&s;tracted Speculation, who will readily join I&s;&s;ue with his Rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>I &s;ee now, more than ever, the Di&s;advantage in Morals, which People mu&s;t labour under, who have not had the Happine&s;s of a liberal and academic Education; who have not &s;ecured a thorough Knowledge of Books, before they venture upon any Acquaintance, or Commerce with the World. For it is in early Youth, be|fore Ideas are crowded, or complexed, while the Fancy is lively, quick to receive, and amo|rous
<PB N="183" REF="223">
to retain, the delicate Sen&s;ations, that the moral Beauty of ab&s;tract Virtue can be able to impre&s;s its Image on the Mind; and you might as well attempt to give a Man of Thirty a Ta&s;te for the nice and inexpre&s;&s;ible Graces of Poetry, Painting, or Mu&s;ic, as to teach a Merchant a Reli&s;h for the Refinements of <HI>Cicero.</HI></P>
<P>However, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the more I am plea&s;ed with this Author, and others of the &s;ame heathen Cla&s;s, the more alarmed I find my&s;elf on Account of the Chri&s;tian Religion; which, tho' allowed to be the fine&s;t and noble&s;t Sy&s;tem of Ethics that ever was framed, I really can't perceive any thing more in, than was &s;aid, wrote, and practi&s;ed, before the <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> Period. I have often heard Hints of the &s;ame Kind upon this Subject in Conver&s;ation, but they never made the lea&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion on me before, becau&s;e they never came from any Per&s;on, whom I did not ob&s;erve to be deficient either in Sen&s;e or Virtue. Now, do not imagine, from any thing I &s;ay, that I am, in the lea&s;t, &s;taggered with Regard to my Faith in our holy Religion; but, as we &s;hould, upon all Occa&s;ions, be ready to give an Account of the Faith that is in us, I &s;hall be obliged, if you will take the Trouble, to render me the Rea&s;on, or Nece&s;&s;ity, for that Revelation; which, without having ever in|quired about, I mo&s;t &s;tedfa&s;tly and implicitly believe in.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> HELOISE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your clever Letter upon tho&s;e Sub|jects, which I left you conver&s;ant about: And, tho' I have already given you every Book from my Study, which I pre&s;umed might adorn a Lady's Library, I believe, I &s;hall &s;oon be obliged to thin my Shelves farther, and call in Aid from the <HI>Cotton</HI> Mu&s;aeum, to &s;upply you.</P>
<P>Your Critici&s;m upon Ta&s;te is fine, and puts me in Mind of a very judicious Remark, I have &s;omewhere met with, upon <HI>Julius Scaliger</HI>; who was allowed to be a Man of great Learn|ing, and deep Erudition, but is ob&s;erved to be but an heavy Commentator upon the inimitable Elegancies of the Cla&s;&s;ics;
<Q>for that he ap|plied him&s;elf to his Studies, &s;omewhat too late in Life.</Q>
There are in moral Virtue certain Graces, which it is not in the Power of Ethic Rules to pre&s;cribe, analogous to the Je-ne-&s;&ccedil;ay-quoi of natural Beauty; which the mo&s;t de&s;criptive Poetry cannot expre&s;s; and which a Per&s;on can be only capable of perceiv|ing, from a &s;ort of Sympathy of Soul; as re|fined
<PB N="185" REF="225">
Spirits are &s;uppo&s;ed to communicate their Ideas, rather by Intuition than Conver&s;e.</P>
<P>Your Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>amorous to retain</HI> is fine; and one In&s;tance, among many in your Writ|ings, of that poetical Elegance, which you al|lude to.</P>
<P>I am not prepared to enter into a Treati&s;e upon the Subject you have &s;tarted; but &s;hall throw together a few unconnected Hints, after the Manner of a Common-Place-Book, which is the only Way I can have Patience to write in.</P>
<P>Religion may be con&s;idered but as moral Virtue, reduced to Method; as human Laws are but a Compendium of Equity. Moral Vir|tue, its Truth, and Beauty, like the Rays of the Sun, are too weak and diffu&s;e for many, the be&s;t Purpo&s;es of Life; but Religion, like a Burning-Gla&s;s, collects tho&s;e &s;cattered Rays, giving them united Force, and more particular Direction.</P>
<P>From the Light of Nature a few ingenious Philo&s;ophers might have deduced, perhaps, the Whole of revealed Ethics; but their Writings could have but a flight and confined Influence over the Generality of Mankind. Rea&s;oning may convince our Minds, but human Nature requires Authority to govern and controul its Actions. Rewards and Puni&s;hments are not clear from the Light of Nature, tho' they may
<PB N="186" REF="226">
be pre&s;umed from the Analogy running thro' all the Works of Providence. The Time, at lea&s;t, could not be a&s;certained, 'till Revelation denounced it to be immediately con&s;equent of our Death; &s;o that, before that Revelation, Men might, perhaps, pre&s;ume upon the Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ome farther State of Probation. Nay, what Certainty of an Hereafter, upon any Terms, could we have, without Revelation?</P>
<P>One great Comfort, in this frail mortal Life, was wanting from the Rea&s;onings of Natural Religion, which the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem has a&s;|&s;ured us of, namely, Remi&s;&s;ion upon Repen|tance; and this has, not only, informed us of one darling Attribute more in the Godhead, but has &s;aved Sinners from the Mi&s;ery and Dan|ger of De&s;pair.</P>
<P>Why the great God has thought proper to make his Revelations &s;o partially, both with Re|gard to Time and Place, in &s;uch and &s;uch a Manner; the My&s;tery of the Incarnation, the Pa&s;&s;ion, with other Articles of Faith, are too ab&s;tru&s;e to enter into here: Be&s;ides, they more properly belong to, what they call, &s;y&s;tematical Divinity; and I &s;hall let them re&s;t, 'till I am at Lei&s;ure to recommend proper Books for your Reading, to in&s;truct you in &s;uch &s;peculative Subjects. So having &s;ufficiently an&s;wered as much of this Matter, as your Letter required, I &s;hall only add this &s;hort Prayer,
<Q>That we
<PB N="187" REF="227">
may both live in Hope, that we may die in Certainty!</Q></P>

<P>Your Remark with Regard to Memory is ve|rified in me, for I know no one that has a bet|ter than my&s;elf; and it is indeed very often a great Incumbrance to me, in more Ca&s;es than one.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CVIII. <HI>HENRY</HI> to <HI>FRANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Am in Ha&s;te to di&s;patch my little Voluntier, before the Po&s;t comes in, le&s;t your Letter &s;hould not leave me Room to &s;ay any Thing of my own; for your Writings are generally &s;o re|plete with Matter and Sentiment, that it takes me up the full Extent of a Letter, merely to an|&s;wer your's; &s;o that there is hardly a Thought, or Expre&s;&s;ion, I can truly call my own, except when I &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf
<Q>Your Lover, and your Friend;</Q>
for that is a Sentiment, which pro|ceeds &s;o naturally from my Heart, that it would frequently occur, whether you had wrote to me or no.</P>
<P>I am well aware, how far &s;hort the&s;e detached E&s;&s;ays will appear of the Papers of our regular Corre&s;pondence; for this remarkable Rea&s;on, that, as natural Philo&s;ophers affirm the Statue to be originally in the Stone, the Hammer and Chi&s;&s;el only clearing of the Rubbi&s;h; &s;o &s;pecu|lative Wits &s;ay, that all Arts and Sciences are innate in the Mind; and that an ingenious Queri&s;t may deduce the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e Theorems of Mathematics, Philo&s;ophy, or Ethics, from the An&s;wers of a rational Re&s;pondent, tho' ever &s;o illiterate. Our epi&s;tolary Conver&s;e I look upon, in this <HI>Socratical</HI> Light; in&s;omuch that, if I &s;ay any Thing, which de&s;erves to be taken
<PB N="196" REF="236">
Notice of, I may rather be &s;aid to have the Hap|pine&s;s to be in&s;pired, than to boa&s;t the Merit of Wit. I have, &s;everal Times, &s;ince we founded the <HI>Amourette,</HI> or <HI>Paraclete,</HI> lamented that, at your poetical Bapti&s;m, you had not taken upon you <HI>Le Nom d' Amour of Heloi&s;e</HI>; but, upon Reflection, I think it better became that Per|&s;on, who was lately &s;tiled &s;o, as &s;he indeed needed many Things to learn, but
<Q><L>You &s;trike each Point with native Force of Mind,</L>
<L>While puzzled Learning labours far be|hind;</L></Q>
and are fitter to be your&s;elf the Preceptor, than the Pupil. For my Part, I acknowledge to have been taught &s;everal Things by you; but the mo&s;t material, and what plea&s;es me mo&s;t, is, that you have brought me to &s;u&s;pect, that I ne|ver loved before. I have Rea&s;on to think now, that I formerly mi&s;took a high Fever, for that noble Pa&s;&s;ion; and, not being &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e Heart-burnings, and quick Pul&s;es toward you, which I had formerly felt for another, I inge|nuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed, that the Love, which makes &s;uch a Bu&s;tle in Romances, was quite extinct in me. However, tho' I might have felt the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> I think, I never did the <HI>Sentiment,</HI> be|fore; for your Charms
<Q>In&s;pire, not Lu&s;t, but elegant De&s;ire;</Q>
and are the exact Rever&s;e of <HI>Sidley</HI>'s Art, as they
<PB N="197" REF="237">
are capable of imparting the cha&s;te&s;t Wi&s;hes to the loo&s;e&s;t Heart; and, as <HI>Milton</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, in refining upon &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, can rai&s;e
<Q>the very <HI>Spirit</HI> of Love, and amorous Delight.</Q>
All my Family have been this Fortnight at &mdash;, attending my Si&s;ter's happy Minute, which is not yet arrived; and I have pa&s;&s;ed my Time here, after a Manner I like be&s;t, when I can't &s;pend it with you. I ri&s;e at Day-break, per|form the Ambarvalia, and divide the whole Day-light between my Ploughs and the Planting of my Trees; never dine 'till Night; then come in hungry, cold, and tired, to a good Fire, a Mutton Chop, a Pint of Wine, a Pinch of Snuff, and a Book. How often, and how &s;incerely, have I wi&s;hed for you, in this Retirement? And what an Age it appears to me, &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t! Which makes me &s;u&s;pect that Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s A&s;&s;ertion is not ju&s;t; for, if Time is mea&s;ured but by the Succe&s;&s;ion of Ideas, how can your Ab&s;ence appear tedious to me, who have thought of nothing el&s;e but you? There is &s;omething, however, in this di&s;parted State, which is not altogether unplea&s;ant; and &s;hews the infinite Goodne&s;s of Providence, and the Happine&s;s of a Mind properly turned, that there are Satisfactions and Emoluments, even in the Misfortunes and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human Life; and that we may, as <HI>Young</HI> expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q>Elaborate an artificial Happine&s;s from Pains.</Q>
<PB N="198" REF="238">
And it is really my Opinion, upon a good deal of Reflection, that no Per&s;on was ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ublime Sen&s;e or Virtue, who was incapable of melancholy Plea&s;ures. The Pre&s;ence of tho&s;e we love is like the Noon; their Ab&s;ence, like the Even of Life; which latter has, I believe, a good deal of that &s;ort of Plea&s;ure I have ju&s;t mentioned.</P>

<P>NOthing le&s;s than the extreme Plea&s;ure I re|ceived from your la&s;t dear, elegant Epi&s;tle, could po&s;&s;ibly have rou&s;ed me from the lethargic Stupidity I have been lately immer&s;ed in:
<Q>As after Winds of ruffling Wing, the Sea, &s;ub|&s;iding &s;low, &s;ettles into a Calm.</Q>
But, as I have already &s;aid, it was &s;uch a one, as I by no Means can boa&s;t of; for it was from Pa&s;&s;ion being exhau&s;ted, not the Power of Rea&s;on, this Apathy aro&s;e. But thy much-loved, thy dear, kind, forming Hand,
<Q>to healthful Mea&s;ure has reduced and tempered the Rage of Pride, the Felne&s;s of Revenge, and all the weak Ex|ce&s;&s;es of my Heart.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="239">Oh! what a Charm has Flattery, when it proceeds from tho&s;e we truly love! How far be|yond Expre&s;&s;ion is the Plea&s;ure I receive from your &s;aying, I am what I mo&s;t wi&s;h to be? For, tho' I am not vain enough to fancy I have the lea&s;t Pretence to tho&s;e Prai&s;es you lavi&s;h on me, yet, as every Eye creates its own Charmer, your kind Partiality may, perhaps, &s;et my little Me|rits in &s;uch an advantageous Light, as may ren|der me plea&s;ing to the &s;ingle Per&s;on, who&s;e Ap|probation is of more Con&s;equence to me, than that of the united World.</P>
<P>With Regard to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t differ from the Opinion you advance, that
<Q>the Statue is originally in the Stone;</Q>
for I am thoroughly con&s;cious, that I am more indebted to you for any amiable Quality, which I may po&s;&s;e&s;s, than to Nature. Perhaps the fir&s;t Sparks were formed by Nature, but they lay as dead as Fire in Flint, which can only be extracted by Steel. &mdash; What you have made, accept of: I am indeed a Crea|ture of your own forming, and therefore all your own.&mdash; But, oh! my deare&s;t <HI>Harry,</HI> remember that, as you have rai&s;ed the Sen&s;ations of my Mind to know the highe&s;t Happine&s;s the hu|man Heart can feel, you have al&s;o rendered me capable of &s;uch Pains, as would
<Q>make Hell &s;uperfluous.</Q></P>
<P>That you do love me, I verily believe; and the fond Hope, that you will ever do &s;o, is all
<PB N="200" REF="240">
the Hold I have of Happine&s;s. The charming Change, you &s;peak of in your Sentiments, has tran&s;ported me almo&s;t beyond my Sen&s;es. To have you love me with Tenderne&s;s and Deli|cacy, all gro&s;s De&s;ires for ever bani&s;hed from your Heart, is Joy un&s;peakable.&mdash;Now, and now only, I begin to live, and you to love.</P>
<P>How earne&s;tly, how pa&s;&s;ionately, do I langui&s;h to be a Partner in the rational Delight you men|tion! to have the E&s;&s;ence of Wi&s;dom, Learn|ing, Eloquence, and Truth, from thy harmo|nious Tongue, 'till, rai&s;ed by Gratitude and Rap|ture, I catch my kind In&s;tructor in my Arms, and teach even him what it is to love! &mdash; Oh! <HI>Harry,</HI> why has not Fortune placed me in a Sphere to indulge my fir&s;t, my la&s;t, my only Wi&s;h, of being always and for ever your's? From the Extremity of Joy my Heart is plunged in the &s;evere&s;t Grief, when I reflect that a few, a very few Months will divide us, perhaps, for ever! Oh! I can't bear the Thought.&mdash;You will forget me then, &mdash; no more remember that you once did love me, or that I ever did, and ever &s;hall love you.&mdash;My Heart is torn in Pieces with this Thought,&mdash;I'll not indulge it.</P>
<P>As I am always plea&s;ed at your being engaged in any Pur&s;uit, that can be either u&s;eful or de|lightful to you, I am charmed with your Pa&s;|&s;ion for Planting. I think it is <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> who &s;ays,

<P>I hope you'll pardon my Quotation, as it is only meant to prove, that the whole Study of my Life ("true as the Needle to the Pole") tends to you only; for I am well a&s;&s;ured this Pa&s;&s;age would have pa&s;&s;ed
<Q>unmarked by my unheeding Eye,</Q>
had you not been ingaged in this noble Avocation. &mdash; In &s;hort, I never take up a Book but with a De&s;ign of rendering my&s;elf more worthy of your per&s;onal or epi&s;tolary Con|ver&s;e. I am well convinced, that not all the Authors I can ever read, will prevent my falling &s;hort of that <HI>ne plus ultra.</HI> It is from you, and you alone, my dear Preceptor, I mu&s;t receive both In&s;piration and Expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>From Lips like your's, what Precepts fail to move?</L>
<L>Too &s;oon they taught me 'twas no Sin to love.</L></Q>
<P>I will with great Plea&s;ure adopt the Name of <HI>Heloi&s;e,</HI> provided you rea&s;&s;ume that of <HI>Abelard</HI>; &s;he who lately had it might have a more intel|ligent Mind, but not one &s;o well calculated to

In &s;hort, meer Man is not able to &s;upport his Spirit, under any of the&s;e Pre&s;&s;ures; and the Writings of &s;everal eminent Men are admirable Re&s;our|ces to &s;trengthen Philo&s;ophy, for the pre&s;ent, and enliven Hope, for the Future; and a Col|lection of Pieces, from &s;everal Authors, in this Stile, which may not improperly be intitled, "The Cordial of Adver&s;ity," would be a very u&s;eful Work on many Occa&s;ions in Life.</P>

<P>I HOPE my having been extremely harra&s;&s;ed with Bu&s;ine&s;s, for this Week pa&s;t, will ap|pear a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e to dear <HI>Harry,</HI> for my not writing la&s;t Po&s;t. I own the Reproof in your's of the 23d both ju&s;t and gentle; but I think Nature is in Fault, not I: For I would not let the pre&s;ent Vexation, or any other, chagrine me, if I could help it;&mdash;but I will have done with the Subject, le&s;t I &s;hould again demon&s;trate, that it is in the Power of Trifles to make me unea&s;y.</P>
<P>Your Letters can indeed lower, or rai&s;e my Spirits, as you plea&s;e: For I con&s;ider my&s;elf but as an In&s;trument, in the Hands of a &s;kilful Mu&s;ician, who can
<Q>&s;ound me from my lowe&s;t Note, to the Top of my Compa&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>I think your Sy&s;tem of Preparation again&s;t the numberle&s;s, di&s;agreeable Occurrences of Life, a very good one; but then, believe me, it will only avail you in the ordinary Accidents, which are common to all Men. For, where a Mind, like your's, meets with any uncommon Misfortune, it is not turning to Authors, that we know wrote well, will afford us Con&s;olation. Such an Under&s;tanding as your's mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t to it&s;elf, whatever has been &s;aid on a parallel Oc|ca&s;ion. But alas! how incapable is Wi&s;dom of alleviating tho&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which affect the Heart! Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> has &s;aid,

&mdash;For my own Part, I know not where to apply my&s;elf for Courage, or Con&s;tancy, to &s;upport what I think infinitely more terrible than Death. If your Study, or Philo&s;ophy, has found out a Me|thod of parting with all we love, without a Pang, it will be but Charity to let me know it; and tho' it may not, perhaps, work &s;o perfect a Cure on me, as you: If it does but alleviate any Part of the Pain, it will be of infinite Ser|vice to me. The Parting of the Soul and Body, tho' a Circum&s;tance that we are from our In|fancy inured to think of, has &s;hook the Courage of the greate&s;t Men.&mdash;How much more dreadful is it to be for ever &s;eparated from what we value much above our&s;elves?&mdash;But, &s;ince it mu&s;t be, I will endeavour to &s;ummon all my Fortitude, and learn from you, to bear it, as I ought; for,
<Q>in Sight of &s;uch a Pattern, to per&s;i&s;t ill &s;uits a Per&s;on honoured with thy Love.</Q>

<P>OUR Journey is fixed, and I am di&s;tracted: I know the Prudence of the Scheme in every Point, and yet nothing but Nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould make me &s;tir. I long to &s;ee you, and yet wi&s;h it not: For, tho' I were to &s;ee you every Day and Hour, I &s;hall never be able to forget, but for a Minute, that I mu&s;t leave <HI>Eng|land</HI> in <HI>May,</HI> with a moral Certainty of never &s;eeing it again. Had not Fortune, as it were, rooted you to a peculiar Spot, what I now look upon as the &s;evere&s;t Kind of Bani&s;hment, could give me but very little Pain; for we are all Ci|tizens of the World.&mdash;As to my Lo&s;s, you will not, cannot feel it: For, in Reality, it is none; and it is as much impo&s;&s;ible that you can ever want a more charming, agreeable Friend, as that you can ever find a &s;incerer.&mdash;Soon, very &s;oon, you will forget me; while I, alas! a helple&s;s Stranger in a foreign Land, &s;hall nei|ther wi&s;h, nor hope for Con&s;olation; for where, or how, or from whom &s;hould I receive it?</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="248">All that remains, after our la&s;t Adieu, is to con&s;ider you as an Inhabitant of another World, and my&s;elf in a local Purgatory; where having proved my Faith and Con&s;tancy, we &s;hall be re-united, again &s;hall meet, to part no more;&mdash; tho' there can be no Certainty that we &s;hall know one another in a future State, I think it is extremely con&s;i&s;tent with human Rea&s;on, to &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall; for I think it is arraigning the Wi&s;dom of the Almighty, to imagine that he &s;hould form us with Pa&s;&s;ions, and Attracti|ons for each other, (which more frequently pro|duce Mi&s;ery, than Happine&s;s, in this Life) and let tho&s;e &s;tronge&s;t, noble&s;t Faculties of the Soul peri&s;h with the Body in the Grave.

The &s;ole Concern, I have ever had about your Fortune, with Regard to my&s;elf, was, that it's not being as ea&s;y, as you could wi&s;h, might perhaps engage you to enter into a Situation, which mu&s;t render my Affection for you criminal. This, I own, has often filled my Heart with Sorrow, and my Eyes with Tears; as the con&s;tant Re&s;ult of this Thought was a fixed Re&s;olution never to &s;ee you more. But, when I have con&s;idered it would

be for your Happine&s;s, I quickly found, I could give up my own.&mdash;All Reflections of this Kind are now over, and, &s;ince the long-feared, fatal Separation mu&s;t arrive, I think, I could, without betraying any Weakne&s;s, hear you were married to a de&s;erving Woman, with a good Fortune. For, &s;ince it is not in my Power to make you happy, all that remains, is, with Sincerity and Truth, to wi&s;h you &s;o.</P>

<Q>for I could find out Things to talk to thee for ever; we ought to &s;ummon all the Spirit of &s;oft Pa&s;&s;ion up, to chear our Hearts, thus labouring with the Pangs of parting.</Q></P>
<P>Pray let me know, in your next, when you really think of coming to Town? I look on every Minute, that we might, and do not &s;pend together, as an irreparable Lo&s;s; for oh! they are but few, compared to the numberle&s;s Hours we mu&s;t pa&s;s a&s;under.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> ELOISE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK you have hit upon one Misfortune in Life, which, perhaps, Philo&s;ophy may not be equal to; either a Di&s;appointment in our Loves, or the intire Separation from the Per&s;on beloved. But either of the&s;e did not occur to me at the Time I wrote that philo&s;ophick Let|ter: Becau&s;e I have not the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of the fir&s;t, as I am well convinced of your Con&s;tancy and Truth; and &s;hall I think we are for ever parted, becau&s;e
<Q>rough Seas divide us, and whole Oceans roll?</Q>
No, my be&s;t-loved, I &s;hould think the whole Southern Ocean but an <HI>Helle&s;pont</HI> between you and me. Be|lieve me, that neither my Attachment here, or your Engagement there, &s;hall &s;eparate us, for any con&s;iderable Time; perhaps, not much longer than our &s;eparate Vocations do already&mdash; of which we will talk more at Lei&s;ure &s;oon.</P>
<P>Another Letter of your's is ju&s;t come in, where you pay me a high Compliment, that you would be plea&s;ed to have my Letters made pub|lick. You acknowledge &s;ome Vanity in this, and you'll find, upon Recollection, that it was owing to the &s;ame, not a different Turn of Mind, <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Quarrel with <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> In the De&s;ire you expre&s;s of making my Writings publick, there is indeed a great deal of publick
<PB N="212" REF="252">
Spirit, and a very ju&s;tifiable Vanity; but nei|ther in the Sen&s;e you mean them; for, if ever I appear in Print, it &s;hall be humbly Attending on you, where I &s;hall only appear like a <HI>Dutch</HI> Comment upon a Cla&s;&s;ick; &s;erve to explain, the Sen&s;e, incapable to expre&s;s the Spirit. I own, I have often thought of &s;ome &s;uch joint Work of our's, which &s;hould bear the Name of the Monument: See the la&s;t Spectator of the 7th Volume; but our Monument &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Title of, <HI>The Paraclete.</HI></P>
<P>You have no Rea&s;on to be jealous of my Attachment to rural <HI>Plea&s;ures</HI>; it is the Coun|try <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> which has detained me from you; and, perhaps, the greate&s;t Satisfaction I have in it, is, that it may &s;oon the better enable me to &s;ee you often, and for a longer Time. The Plea&s;ures alone, tho' they were as high, as the mo&s;t Pa&s;toral Poet ever feigned them, could not with-hold me a Moment from you, whom I &s;hall always con&s;ider as my charming <HI>Rus in Urbe</HI>; in whom is joined all the Sweetne&s;s, Innocence, and Truth of a Country Life, with all the highe&s;t Refinements of a Court.</P>
<P>Your Argument, about our Knowledge of each other in a future State, has &s;omething in it not only very pretty, but of rational Philo|&s;ophy, and &s;ound Divinity; and I will re&s;t my Faith upon it, as that charming Hope gives me

<P>I AM come hither in Que&s;t of Vote and In|tere&s;t, but return To-morrow. <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> next I &s;et out from <HI>Belvidere,</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI> from &mdash;, for <HI>London.</HI> I &s;hall pa&s;s round thro' the County of &mdash;, &s;o what Day I &s;hall be in Town, I can better let you know from &s;ome Stage on the Road.</P>
<P>I can hardly expre&s;s what an Impatience I have to return to the Country, tho' I have been but two Days from it, upon Bu&s;ine&s;s too which I like, the Serving of a Friend, and in a very agreeable Town too. In &s;hort, I find that all the Spirit of Ambition and active Life is quite extingui&s;hed in me; and &s;upplanted by the tran|quil Plea&s;ures and &s;peculative Lei&s;ure of rural Retirement; heedle&s;s how little my Sentiments, or Actions, &s;hine forth before the bu&s;y World, &s;o you and I approve. In this philo&s;ophick Heroi&s;m, I think I exceed <HI>Cincinnatus,</HI> and &s;ome other of the gallant Per&s;onages of Antiquity; they indeed returned to the Plough, but I would not leave it. This Turn of Mind, which I have
<PB N="214" REF="254">
had for &s;ome Time, has &s;taggered my Faith, with Regard to the Change occa&s;ioned in the Nature of Things, on Account of original Sin: Particularly, that Tillage and Agriculture be|came then nece&s;&s;ary, to obtain the Fruits of the Earth, which u&s;ed to grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly before. Now I am &s;ufficiently orthodox in &s;ound Doc|trine, tho' I have not a Lepro&s;y of Faith about me; and, if this moral Exerci&s;e, both of Body and Mind, was meant as a Cur&s;e, how comes it to be attended with &s;o much rational and philo&s;ophick Plea&s;ure? If the Mind of Man was changed, at the &s;ame Time, &s;o as to ac|commodate it&s;elf to this Employment, what is become of the Cur&s;e? There is &s;uch a natural Sen&s;e of the&s;e Plea&s;ures implanted in our Souls, that we are &s;truck with it, at fir&s;t Sight, we know not how; we feel a vague Kind of Ad|miration, we know not why; and are &s;en&s;ible of a certain Earne&s;tne&s;s of Affection, we know not for what; not unlike the fir&s;t Longings of a Maid. How high then mu&s;t this natural Plea|&s;ure be, when it becomes a rational one! when we are able to contemplate the Beauties of the Creation in a philo&s;ophick Light, to explore the admirable Contrivance of Providence, and in|ve&s;tigate the hidden Cau&s;es of all natural Ef|fects!&mdash;But I am going too far, and detain|ing my&s;elf from the Enjoyment of a Plea&s;ure, in the Contemplation of it; &s;o &s;hall take my

The Noms d'Amour of <HI>Eloi&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Sappho,</HI> may be more according to the Rules of Gallantry: But as in the latter Titles you are con&s;idered as a per&s;onated Character, and in the Former a real One, I chu&s;e to addre&s;s you in the familiar Phra&s;e, as I well know, you have more Charms in Reality, than it is in the Power of Fiction to give you. In &s;hort, my dear Girl, according to an elegant De&s;cription in &s;ome of the Cla&s;&s;icks, in the Novel you are <HI>formo&s;a,</HI> but in your&s;elf, <HI>ip&s;a Forma.</HI> The mak|ing U&s;e of <HI>Latin</HI> Sentences to you may, perhaps, appear a little pedantick, but there is indeed, in your Under&s;tanding, &s;o little of Effeminacy, that I frequently con&s;ider you, not only as a Man, but a Man of Letters too; and I re|member, I once threatened, &mdash; that, if at any Time you &s;hould &s;ay or do any Thing

In a Word, the Redintegration of our Affecti|ons, like a mutual Triumph, is to be con&s;ider|ed more as an Alliance, than a Conque&s;t; and, for my own Part, I confe&s;s that the Regaining of your Regard and E&s;teem, like a Conque&s;t over one's own Pa&s;&s;ions, has &s;uch a Re&s;ignation to Sen&s;e and Virtue, that it in&s;pires me with a calm, humble Pride, very different from the Exultation we feel, upon ordinary Triumphs.</P>

<P>I CONFESS that, like you, I am fonder of this &s;imple Appellation, than all the florid Names, that ever graced Romance; but, like your Complai&s;ance, this Fondne&s;s bears but a late Date: For I well remember a Time, when I would have exchanged the mo&s;t advantageous Propo&s;al of Marriage, for a Letter &s;igned <HI>Oron|dates, Cyrus,</HI> or any other heroick Name.

<P>Hurried as I am, and plagued with Bu&s;ine&s;s more than ever I was in my Life, I pa&s;s many Hours in &s;ilent Conver&s;ations with you; and, when I &s;tart from my Reveries, am &s;urprized, and &s;orry at not finding you "clo&s;e by my Side." &mdash;My being immer&s;ed in Bu&s;ine&s;s, as it con|fines me much at Home, where I have no Com|panion, makes all my Thoughts turn upon you; and I have frequently, in reading aloud, applied to you, for your Opinion of a Sentiment&punc;&mdash; Why are you not here to an&s;wer me?</P>

Not that I want fre&s;h Proofs, to convince me, that, had he a proper Object to in&s;pire him, his Writings might well vie with any, the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters in the Art of Plea&s;ing. For my own Part, I &s;olemnly declare that the Addre&s;&s;es of the greate&s;t Monarch on Earth could not, to my Vanity, afford &s;o high a Tri|umph, as tho&s;e elegant Prai&s;es, which your dear charming Letters abound with. There is in my Temper &s;omething, that ari&s;es, either from Be|nevolence to the World, or &s;elfi&s;h Vanity; (I can't tell which:) that, in Contradiction to <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Opinion, and your's, makes me wi&s;h to communicate the Plea&s;ure I receive from your Writings to the World; for I look upon it as a high Degree of Avarice, to monopolize &s;uch an invaluable Trea&s;ure.</P>

Let me therefore intreat my deare&s;t <HI>Harry,</HI> to look on my Friend&s;hip for him as truely Ma&s;culine: But let my Under|&s;tanding &s;till claim all the Privileges of the Feminine Gender.</P>
<P>I think we have both great Rea&s;on to tri|umph in our late Reconciliation; as you, in at|tempting to regain my E&s;teem, paid the highe&s;t Compliment to my Affection for you; while I proved to Demon&s;tration, that you had Merits &s;ufficient to &s;urmount my Pride, and your own Failings.&mdash;May we long continue to re|ceive Plea&s;ure from the Recollection of our pa&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, and to look on that, as the hap|pie&s;t Aera of our Lives, that re&s;tored us to each other.</P>

<P>I RECEIVED your la&s;t Adieu, and am in Reality more obliged to you, than I &s;hould have been, for a much kinder; for by convinc|ing me, you felt no Concern from our Separa|ration, you le&s;&s;ened mine extremely.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely hope that the Fre&s;hne&s;s and Purity of the Country Air will, in a few Days, re&s;tore you to perfect Health; and I make not the lea&s;t Doubt, but its contemplative Plea|&s;ures will quickly recover your Spirits to that calm, uniform, philo&s;ophick Chearfulne&s;s, which the interpo&s;ing Impertinence of di&s;agreeable, or
<PB N="222" REF="262">
(at be&s;t) in&s;ipid Objects may, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, have ruffled.</P>
<P>You compliment me extremely, when you &s;uppo&s;e me capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the Effects of Joy from tho&s;e of Plea&s;ure: I have been but little conver&s;ant with either of them, there|fore my Ignorance is excu&s;able, &s;hould I tell you, I always looked on them as twin Si&s;ters, and &s;o very like, that it was difficult to know, one from t'other. I think too, they are the joint Offspring of Love and Rea&s;on, who, di&s;|puting to whom they &s;hould pay mo&s;t Obedience, quarrelled, and have never &s;ince been reconciled.</P>
<P>But, to &s;peak in a more natural Way, I look upon Joy and Plea&s;ure to be &s;ynonymous Terms; they ari&s;e from one Faculty, or Affec|tion of the Mind; and Joy is nothing more or le&s;s than the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Emotion, which breaks out, on our being really plea&s;ed. I will not pretend to &s;ay, that my Definition is right; I have only given my Opinion.&mdash;But this I know, that, if I am not capable of ab&s;tracting Joy from Plea&s;ure, I can, at lea&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;h Plea&s;ure from Indifference:&mdash;For this Rea&s;on you may ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e the Party at an End, from the Moment it was mentioned; and I here give you my Word, it is the la&s;t of the Kind, I &s;hall ever propo&s;e with you. I hope you will pardon what is pa&s;t, on this very &s;incere Pro|mi&s;e of Amendment.</P>
<P>I am far from being di&s;plea&s;ed, at finding
<PB N="223" REF="263">
your Prudence &s;uperior to mine: It has indeed been &s;o, thro' the whole Cour&s;e of our Ac|quaintance; but as, I believe, there are few People, who have more Quickne&s;s and Viva|city in their Di&s;po&s;itions, &s;o there is no Per&s;on breathing, who&s;e Spirits are more ea&s;ily damp|ed, than mine; for Want of Re&s;olution has hitherto been my greate&s;t Fault, as well as Misfortune.&mdash;As I have been often led by Per&s;ua&s;ion to many Things, contrary to my Inclinations; while, from Want of Re&s;olution, I have left undone tho&s;e Things, which Rea&s;on, Virtue, Prudence, and Pride dictated.&mdash;In both the&s;e Ca&s;es, I con&s;ider my&s;elf, as very blameable; by acting in direct Oppo&s;ition to the little Under&s;tanding, that Providence has ble&s;&s;ed me with. In this Light, I think my &s;upport|ing any Kind of Corre&s;pondence with you an Offence again&s;t my&s;elf more unpardonable, than any I ever yet had Will, or Power to commit, to the Prejudice of any other Creature. But, tho' this, like all other Acts of Folly, carries its Puni&s;hment in the Commi&s;&s;ion, I am deter|mined not to leave it in your Power, to make that an Act of Nece&s;&s;ity, which I de&s;ign a Sa|crifice.&mdash;And as I am not capable of afford|ing you any Kind of Happine&s;s, without in|juring my&s;elf, I think it is high Time to put an End to our mutual Unea&s;ine&s;s, and remain &s;atisfied with the plea&s;ing Belief, that we would each do much, to make the other happy.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="264">You know this Re&s;olution has taken up my Thoughts for &s;ome Time; and I &s;olemnly de|clare, I mention it now from no other Motive, but a De&s;ign of reducing it to Practice.

<P>I thank you for your kind Con&s;truction of my Words and Actions; may they ever ap|pear to you, in their native, genuine Light! you will then think of me,
<Q>as one, that loved not wi&s;ely, but too well.</Q>
I have not been out of Doors, &s;ince I &s;aw you, nor well one Moment. I had a violent Return of the Cho|lick, about three Hours after you left me; I could not re&s;t in Bed, but walked about the Room all Night; by this Means I increa&s;ed my Cold, and have now got a very comfortable Cough.

<P>I AM ju&s;t got Home, for I was &s;o ill on the Road, that I was not able to perform the Journey in the u&s;ual Time. What alarms me is, that I neither find my&s;elf better, or wor&s;e; which makes me apprehend, that the Di&s;order is become Part of my Con&s;titution; for, to borrow an Allu&s;ion from moral Things, it has been ob&s;erved that Per&s;ons of equal Tempers have been always found in Love, or Friend&s;hip, more remarkable for Con&s;tancy, than tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to Heats and Colds.</P>
<P>Memorandum,&mdash;This Cold I got in the Court of Chancery; and I fear it will la&s;t, like a Chancery Suit, for Life; tho', to &s;hew you I am not &s;plenetick about the Matter, let us talk of Death and Burial a little; for tho&s;e, who are mo&s;t afraid, care lea&s;t to &s;peak of them. As to my Death, I would chu&s;e a &s;udden one, contrary to a Prayer in the <HI>Litany</HI>; for I hope nothing from a Death-bed Repentance, as, by the Tenor of a Man's Life, he ought, in Ju&s;tice, to be judg|ed. If I was to linger, I &s;hould chu&s;e to be in Pain; as the getting Ea&s;e might better reconcile me to the Thoughts of Death.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="266">As to my Burial, I do not like any of the Methods u&s;ed by the Antients, or Moderns. The <HI>Egyptian</HI> Mummy, which was in the high|e&s;t E&s;teem, I di&s;like more than all; for I can't bear the Thought of lying a Moment idle, either alive, or dead; for which Rea&s;on, I pre|fer Burning the Body to any other Way, (not in the <HI>A&s;be&s;to</HI> Shrowd) becau&s;e the Parts di&s;&s;i|pated in Smoke fall immediately to Earth again, and become the fir&s;t Food of Plants, which im|mediately become the fir&s;t Food of Animals; &s;o that a Man may have a Re&s;urrection of every Part of his Body, in a &s;hort Time after his Death; which, tho' he will not be con&s;cious of, will &s;urely flatter his Vanity, as well as the Thoughts of Fame, which he is &s;uppo&s;ed to know as little of. But tho' I prefer Burning, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, to any other Method u&s;ually practi&s;ed, yet, if I were to chu&s;e for my&s;elf, I would rather be devoured by Bea&s;ts; as, by that Means, I &s;hould more immediately become Part of a living Animal; and the Bea&s;ts I would name, &s;hould be Dogs, becau&s;e their In&s;tinct comes the neare&s;t to human Rea&s;on, of any Brute; and the Dogs I would pitch upon, &s;hould be three, of three different Kinds; a Ma&s;tiff, for its Courage; a Hound, for its Sa|gacity, and a Spaniel, for its Fidelity.</P>

<P>A KIND of Super&s;tition, which I have nei|ther Power nor Inclination to account for, impels me, in Contradiction to my Rea&s;on, to write to you. When I wrote la&s;t, I re&s;olved to write no more; there is nothing in your Let|ter, that requires an An&s;wer, yet in a Room full of Company, where I have dined and &s;up|ped, (for it is now near 12 o'Clock) I cannot re&s;i&s;t a &s;omething like In&s;atuation, that prompts me to tell you, I am really concerned, and a|larmed at the Account, you give me of your&s;elf, with Regard to your Mind, as well as Body.

<P>I thank you extremely for your Concern about my Health; and be a&s;&s;ured, my deare&s;t <HI>Fanny,</HI> that this is equal to any one Rea&s;on I have to be concerned about it my&s;elf.

<P>I find my Love of Solitude increa&s;ing every Day; which Inclination, be&s;ide the Enjoyment of Solitude it&s;elf, gives me a very flattering Plea|&s;ure; for, according to a rational and refined Opinion or Sentiment of your's, mentioned in a late Conver&s;ation, we are not only to perfect our&s;elves in Virtue here, but al&s;o in a true Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h for the Plea&s;ures of the Ble&s;&s;ed, if we would reach the Sublimity of tho&s;e Joys which we are taught to hope for. Now, me|thinks my Aver&s;ion from Society, and frequent Retiring, as it were, within my&s;elf, in a great Mea&s;ure, prepares me for the Enjoyment of that intuitive Conver&s;e, which Spirits or Angels hold with each other, by intellectual Vi&s;ion; with|out the paltry, &s;low, and imperfect Aid of Sounds; of which &s;piritual Act, I think, the Communing with our own Hearts, Reflection, or mental Soliloquy, have a very great Re&s;em|blance.</P>
<P>Other Lovers &s;ay, they would retire from all Society for you; but I would quit even Soli|tude for your Conver&s;e, as it is a nearer Ap|proach to tho&s;e Plea&s;ures I hinted at above, and in &s;ome Sort the Enjoyment of that Heaven up|on Earth: But

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN we read a <HI>Spectator</HI> of <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s together lately in <HI>London,</HI> you may re|member, I cavi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led at his &s;aying, the Will was one of the Faculties of the Soul. When I came home, I looked into <HI>Locke</HI>'s <HI>E&s;&s;ay upon the human Under&s;tanding,</HI> and finding him in the &s;ame Story, I began to reflect a little upon this Head, and found, I had apprehended that the Will was &s;aid to be one of the <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Qualities of the Soul; but the Word, <HI>Faculty,</HI> being a compre|hen&s;ive Term, and &s;ignifying a Power, then whatever a Soul has the Power of doing is called one of its Faculties, tho' not one of its e&s;&s;ential Qualities; &s;o that, in the general Sen&s;e of the Phra&s;e, neither <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> or <HI>Locke</HI> may be repre|hended; but as they both join <HI>Willing,</HI> which is but a Power, to <HI>Thinking,</HI> which is a Pro|perty, I apprehend they are mi&s;taken in their Metaphy&s;ics, by ranking them under the &s;ame Cla&s;s. And it was this Error, which, occurring
<PB N="232" REF="272">
&s;trongly to me at the Time I mention, made me ha&s;tily conclude, that, if there was any Mi&s;take in <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> it mu&s;t be rather in his Words than his Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>I was well plea&s;ed I had this Occa&s;ion of looking into Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> (which is a Book I had never read but once, when I was very young) becau&s;e, upon this &s;ame Subject, he has affirmed a Thing which has provoked me extremely; and, if he has not been called to account for it before now, it would &s;urprize me; but, as I ne|ver met any Thing written on this Head, I &s;hall take the Liberty of an&s;wering him.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Chapter of his &s;econd Book he affirms, that the Soul does not always think; that Thinking is not Part of its E&s;&s;ence, but one of its Operations; <HI>i. e.</HI> Faculty or Power, in the diffu&s;ive Sen&s;e. This I deny, for, if we can &s;uppo&s;e a Soul not to think for an In&s;tant, we can &s;uppo&s;e it not to think for a Day, a Month, a Year, and &s;o for Eternity: Which is contrary to the Nature of a Soul, therefore im|po&s;&s;ible: For wherein does a Soul con&s;i&s;t, if not in Thought and Reflection? He compares Thought to Motion; and &s;ays, A Body, tho' it &s;ometimes moves, does not nece&s;&s;arily move. How imperfect is this Rea&s;oning! and how weak all Illu&s;trations of &s;piritual Operations, by referring them to &s;en&s;ible Acts! A Body does not move of it&s;elf, but either mediately or imme|diately by &s;ome Spirit; and is therefore depen|dent
<PB N="233" REF="273">
on Spirit, for its Operations: But &s;urely Spirit is independant on Matter, and &s;elf-&s;uffi|cient in its own Powers; and, as the &s;everal Qualities, Properties, or Faculties of the Soul, are not really di&s;tinct, but only philo&s;ophically divided, to give us a better or more formal Me|thod of rea&s;oning about them; as it is the whole Soul which thinks, reflects, rea&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then, &s;hould any of the&s;e Qualities or Faculties cea&s;e to operate but for an In&s;tant, what &s;hould ever call them to Action again?&mdash;except that Al|mighty Power, which fir&s;t &s;et them to work: And this would be equal to a new Creation of that, or any other Spirit; and to be repeated as often as it began to think, reflect, or rea&s;on. Which, as the Author of Nature acts always by the mo&s;t &s;imple Laws, we are not to &s;uppo&s;e, without &s;tronger Rea&s;ons than weak Men's mere Hypothe&s;is. In &s;hort, if Thinking is not e&s;&s;en|tial to a Soul, what are its e&s;&s;ential Qualities? If it has no e&s;&s;ential Qualities, then it exi&s;ts not at all. Exten&s;ion is e&s;&s;ential to Matter; when Matter cea&s;es to have Exten&s;ion, it cea&s;es to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;peaks again&s;t the Soul's e&s;&s;ential Thought, to introduce his Rea&s;oning again&s;t innate Ideas; but, as innate Ideas are one of the Proofs brought for the Being of a God, I will never give them up, upon any Rea&s;oning le&s;s than Conviction. He &s;hews us indeed how we may come by mo&s;t of the Ideas we have, with|out
<PB N="234" REF="274">
any previous Impre&s;&s;ion; but this does not prove, we have no &s;uch previous Impre&s;&s;ion; for the &s;ame Truth may be conveyed to us by dif|ferent Ways. I grant him, that the Ideas of Colours, and of all &s;en&s;ible Objects, may be acquired by Experience; but, if Truth, Beauty, Harmony, or Order, were not originally im|pre&s;&s;ed on our Souls, nothing in this World, not even the Objects them&s;elves, could excite our Ideas of them. All the Ideas, we have in com|mon with Brutes, I will allow we may acquire, as they do&mdash;but no farther.</P>
<P>I am neither better or wor&s;e of my Cold; nor more or le&s;s affectionately and &s;incerely your's, my dear <HI>Fanny</HI>&mdash;which I &s;hall continue as long as my innate Ideas of Truth, Beauty, Harmony, and Order &s;hall exi&s;t.</P>

<P>THE Plea&s;ure I received from my dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s la&s;t Letter, like the intuitive Conver&s;e he mentions, can only be imagined, not expre&s;&s;ed. I care not how incon&s;i&s;tent you think me, provided you believe, that
<Q><L>Sorrow ne'er can touch my Mind,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t you are well, and not unkind.</L></Q></P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding that my every Word and Action prove, even again&s;t my Will, the Strength of my Affection for you, I cannot help earne&s;tly de&s;iring to put an End to the conti|nual Anxiety, which my Attachment does, and
<PB N="235" REF="275">
ever will produce. I &s;till think, that Parting from what we love much dearer than our&s;elves, is far more dreadful, than the la&s;t &s;ad Adieu 'twixt Soul and Body; for, in general, the Soul is weary of its Confinement, and tired out with Pain; it longs to mingle with its kindred Spi|rits, to &s;atisfy its boundle&s;s Thir&s;t of Know|ledge; to range thro' all the liquid Fields of Air, to contemplate the Glories of its own E&s;|&s;ence, in the immediate Pre&s;ence of that Al|mighty Being, from whom it &s;prung. Perhaps it longs to be again re&s;tored to the dear Con|ver&s;e of &s;ome much-loved and long lamented Friend. On the Contrary, a Per&s;on in this World, who is &s;eparated from tho&s;e, he has loved long, and well, bears the wor&s;t Kind of Death, a living one; and may be con&s;idered in the &s;ame State, as I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e an angelick Being, if bani&s;hed from his Creator's Pre&s;ence, compelled to take a human Form, and live on Earth, among the Sons of Men. It is retain|ing a &s;trong Idea of the Happine&s;s, he had once enjoyed, mu&s;t double every Di&s;tre&s;s; and his De&s;ire to be re&s;tored to the Conver&s;e, he was deprived of, mu&s;t render all other painful to him.</P>
<P>Let me now a&s;k you, if you &s;uppo&s;e, that any rational Being would voluntarily ru&s;h into &s;uch a Scene of Mi&s;ery, as I have de&s;cribed? Yet this mu&s;t be the End of all that Love, that Con|&s;tancy and Truth, I have pre&s;erved inviolable

to you&mdash;painful Reflection! this la&s;t Paragraph has &s;unk my Spirits &s;o very low, that I mu&s;t quit the Subject.&mdash;Oh! that my Heart could &s;hut it out for ever!</P>
<P>I think it is <HI>Cowley</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>a Man mu&s;t in|tirely be dive&s;ted of all <HI>Affections,</HI> as well as <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> before he can enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Solitude: For, if his Mind be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with either, he had better been in a Fair, than a Wood; for our Pa&s;&s;ions may, like petty Thieves, pick our Pockets in the Mid&s;t of Company; but, like Robbers, they u&s;e to &s;trip, bind, or murder us, when they catch us alone: This is but to retreat from Men, and fall into the Hands of the Devil.</Q>
I therefore congratulate you, and &s;hould endea|vour to condole my&s;elf, did not your Happine&s;s always appear of more Moment to me, than my own; but as I have not &s;o entirely &s;ubdued my Pa&s;&s;ions, as you &s;eem to have done, I can only pretend to a&s;&s;ure you, from the Sincerity of my Heart, that I would prefer your Com|pany to that of any Per&s;on, who does, or ever did exi&s;t; I do not except any one of the fir&s;t, or la&s;t <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> Age.&mdash;And I may go farther, by a&s;&s;uring you, that, if I know my own Heart, I would prefer you to all of them, and live in Shades, with thee, and Love alone; or, to u&s;e the Words of the Author I have already quoted,&mdash;

<P>Your remembering any Sentiment of mine, affords the highe&s;t Triumph both to my Love, and Vanity: For you, and you only, can rai&s;e either. I don't wonder at all, that you &s;hould prefer Communing with your own Heart, to any other Conver&s;ation, this World can afford; it &s;urely mu&s;t be a Kind of Anticipation of tho&s;e cele&s;tial Joys, we are to &s;uppo&s;e the Portion of the Ble&s;&s;ed; as it mu&s;t continually fill your Mind with the highe&s;t Sentiments of Gratitude and Rapture to the Divine Being, who has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to bring you &s;o much nearer his infinite Perfection, than your Fellow-crea|tures. He has, indeed, my deare&s;t <HI>Harry,</HI> ble&s;&s;ed you with &s;uch uncommon Talents, as render it impo&s;&s;ible for you to be negatively good; and mu&s;t either make you an Ornament, or Di&s;grace to that Rank of Beings, you are placed in.</P>
<P>I thank you heartily for your very elegant Compliment, but I am well convinced, both from Rea&s;on and Experience, that you mu&s;t have le&s;s Under&s;tanding, or I more, before you can po&s;&s;ibly prefer my Company to your own.</P>
<P>I received your E&s;&s;ay, and am exce&s;&s;ively angry that you have left me nothing to &s;ay on the Occa&s;ion; it is &s;o like Conviction, which I hate, becau&s;e it de&s;troys Argument. How was it po&s;&s;ible for you to find Words to demon&s;trate the undoubted Truths, which you have proved?
<PB N="238" REF="278">
For I look upon this to be the mo&s;t difficult Species of Writing.</P>
<P>Now for my&s;elf, which, by ju&s;t Gradation, I mention la&s;t. I have been very ill with con&s;tant Cholicks, ever &s;ince you left Town; I grow wor&s;e every Day, and am at la&s;t, prevailed on to take an Emetick; which di&s;agreeable Ope|ration I &s;hall &s;et about, the Moment I have fini&s;hed this abominable Scrawl. I ab&s;olutely don't know what I write: My Aunt has been talking to me ever &s;ince I took up the Pen. I am really a&s;hamed to let &s;uch a Collection of Blots, Blunders, and Tautologies go out of my Hands; but, if I ever had any Talent for Writ|ing, it is intirely worn out; and I &s;et about it with as much Reluctance, as I do Eating, when I have no Appetite; merely becau&s;e I know it is nece&s;&s;ary to my &s;upporting Life.</P>
<P>You are not "&s;ent a bani&s;hed Man, to roam;" it is I, alas! who am the Exile.&mdash;I hope to hear, by To-morrow's Po&s;t, that you have quite got the better of your Cold.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM heartily concerned at the bad Account you give me of your Health, and mu&s;t in|treat you will act by me in that Affair as I did by you; for when I found you were fondly alarmed at my Di&s;order, I u&s;ed all the Methods I could think of, to get my&s;elf well again&s;t the next Po&s;t, that I might ingenuou&s;ly give you an Account of my Recovery; which I partly feigned in my la&s;t Letter, to make you ea&s;y&mdash;but I &s;hall make no Oblations to <HI>Hygea</HI> for the Cure, if &s;he has neglected your Health to take Care of mine.</P>
<P>There is really &s;omething unaccountable in the Turn of Mind, you &s;eem to have been in, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t: You &s;ay, you fear we &s;hall &s;ome Time or other part, therefore de&s;ire to do it now;
<Q>&s;o run into the Danger, to avoid the Apprehen&s;ion.</Q>
Such Caprice as this would make us bani&s;h Friends, Children, and every Ble&s;&s;ing of Life, from our Enjoyment, becau&s;e, perhaps, one Day or other we may be deprived of them. What Rea&s;on in the World have you to apprehend any Separation in our Loves? I declare, upon my Honour, that I am not the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of any Decay in my Regard, Af|fection, A&s;&s;iduity, Love, or Friend&s;hip for you; nor am I con&s;cious of any Engagement, Scheme, Policy, or Ambition, which &s;hould make it ho|nourable, or hone&s;t, even to wi&s;h my Attach|ment
<PB N="240" REF="280">
le&s;s to you. Surely the fond Expo&s;tula|tion I make with you, at pre&s;ent, ought to con|vince you of the Sincerity and Ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of this Declaration; for, if my Ficklene&s;s or Cap|rice had given me other Sentiments toward you, what a va&s;t and lucky Relief would your pre&s;ent and late Behaviour be to me! How readily &s;hould I then take you at your Word, happy to have my Incon&s;tancy accounted for to the World, and ju&s;tified even by the Per&s;on I was willing to for&s;ake! Indeed, my deare&s;t <HI>Fanny,</HI> if ever you mention this Subject to me again, there will be no Way left of accounting for it, but &s;uppo&s;ing that you find &s;omething in your own Heart, which may make you apprehend that my Con|&s;tancy, Love, and Attachment to you, may &s;ome Time or other be a Reproach to you.</P>
<P>There is another Pa&s;&s;age in your la&s;t Letter, which I ab&s;olutely interdict you for the future. How can you be &s;o di&s;ingenuous, as to &s;ay, you cannot write? For no-body, who writes well, can be ignorant of it; nor can any-body ever write well, who does not think they do. I de|clare, I never met with Writings in any Lan|guage more &s;en&s;ible, more delicate, or more cor|rect, than mo&s;t of your Letters; and, if I do not, upon every Occa&s;ion, expre&s;s my ju&s;t Sen&s;e of them, it is becau&s;e I really think their Merit is above my Prai&s;e; and whenever I do mention them, in the Manner I do now, it is more from the Vanity of &s;hewing you my own Ta&s;te, than to pay any Compliment to your's.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="281">We have had the mo&s;t di&s;ingenous Weather I ever remember, &s;ince I came down to the Country: It promi&s;es and threatens by Turns, but fulfils neither; and keeps one in a State of Uncertainty, both with Regard to Bu&s;ine&s;s or Plea&s;ure, which is very perplexing.

I am indeed much better, Thanks to my Regard for you; for, were I not

That Love of Life, which is, I believe, implanted in the Heart of every Creature, ren|ders Death formidable to us while we are in perfect Health; but when the animal Spirits are weakened by Pain, when we only live to Mi|&s;ery, our Sentiments are wholly changed, and we wi&s;h for Death, as a Relief from Torment. Think then, if my every Thought, Hope, and Wi&s;h were not centered in you, how earne&s;tly &s;hould I have de&s;ired a Deliverance from Pain! But, perhaps I deceive my&s;elf; perhaps, in Con|tradiction to what I have &s;aid, the Voice of Nature, more powerful than even that of Love, made me wi&s;h to live,&mdash;perhaps, my Life is of no Con&s;equence to you,&mdash;

For the pre&s;ent, my Regard for you renders every Plea&s;ure in Life in&s;ipid to me; and every Accident indifferent, that has not &s;ome Relation to you; &mdash;my whole Time and Thoughts are devoted to you; and Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or Plea&s;ure, are alike hateful to me.

But tell me, my deare&s;t <HI>Harry,</HI> what will all this end in?

on it, for Fear of hurting the Root? Mu&s;t Truth then avail it&s;elf of Fal&s;hood, and mu&s;t the Imperfections of Man be &s;anctified by the Perfection of God? Let a Man be fir&s;t convin|ced of the Truth and Rea&s;on of any Doctrine, and then let him boldly &s;peak out, even in Re|ligion it&s;elf; nay, more freely there, for Truth cannot contradict Truth; and Religion is our greate&s;t Concern here, as it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be our greate&s;t Concern hereafter. The Chri&s;tian Religion is indeed founded, and very properly &s;o, upon Faith; and the &s;tronge&s;t Rea&s;ons, next to Demon&s;tration, for the Belief. But all its Doctrines are, and ought to be, founded on Rea&s;on&mdash;therefore &s;ubject to Di&s;qui&s;ition. I am extremely provoked at tho&s;e, who ju&s;tify the Su|per&s;titions and Impo&s;itions of the Prie&s;ts, under the plau&s;ible Title of pious Frauds; which, with more Ju&s;tice, I &s;tile impious Fal&s;hoods. Mu&s;t Truth then avail it&s;elf of Error, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> For I think it Bla&s;phemy to affirm any Thing under the Sanction of Religion, which is not of di|vine Authority; either from Rea&s;on, which is the Deity within, or Revelation, its Manife&s;ta|tion without. If <HI>Montaigne</HI>'s Rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, it was &s;o from the Beginning; and mu&s;t con&s;e|quently have overlaid the Chri&s;tian Religion in its Birth. His whole Argument, upon this Pa&s;|&s;age, might be &s;hewn to be extremely weak, but that I &s;hould think it a Weakne&s;s to con|fute him. However, it is not owing to any
<PB N="253" REF="293">
Want of Sen&s;e or Judgment in the Author, but to a certain Lazine&s;s in his Di&s;po&s;ition, which did not &s;uffer him to examine clo&s;ely his own Opinions; but, after the Manner of an old Man, of which all his Writings are full, found it ea&s;ier to talk than think.</P>
<P>After his wild Manner he hops away, and flies into an E&s;&s;ay about the Rationality of Brutes. If the Schoolmen will not allow me this Expre&s;&s;ion, by tying me down to a certain Definition, I &s;hall only an&s;wer them, by quot|ing a Critici&s;m of <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s upon <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Eclogues</HI>; that, if they are not Pa&s;torals, they are &s;ome|thing better. I think he has offered a great many very bold and clever Arguments on this Subject; which, tho' they do not prove the Matter, do, at lea&s;t, put it out of the Power of tho&s;e, who deny it, to prove the Contrary. His whole De&s;ign, thro' the E&s;&s;ay, is, by &s;hewing the In&s;ufficiency of human Under&s;tanding, to re|commend to us our Dependence upon Faith; and, tho' there are few People, who are more inclined to a free and canva&s;&s;ed Di&s;qui&s;ition of all Matters, even the mo&s;t &s;acred, and mo&s;t general received Opinions, than I have always been, yet the Arguments of <HI>Montaigne,</HI> deduced from the Writings of the wi&s;e&s;t of the antient and modern Philo&s;ophers, have indeed put me out of Con|ceit with the vain Imaginations, and pre&s;ump|tuous Rea&s;onings, of human Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="294">It was &s;aid by &s;ome Writer, that the Being of a God was &s;o far from a Matter of Doubt, that it was the only Thing of which we could be certain.

<P>I CAME hither in &s;pight of very oppo&s;ing Weather. Along the Road I perceived Marks of the violent Storm; and I found the great Sign and Half of the Stables of this Inn carried away by it. I beg, the fir&s;t Account you hear of the Yacht, you will let me hear it.</P>
<P>I amu&s;ed my&s;elf, on the Way, with reflecting upon every Per&s;on, Circum&s;tance, and Thing,
<PB N="255" REF="295">
which I parted from, at &mdash;: But the only Occa&s;ion I had to philo&s;ophize, was on little <HI>Jenny</HI>; for, from playing with the Child, I took a Hint to examine into an Opinion, which the World &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, and perhaps receive it upon Tru&s;t from one another, as they do a great many others, without inquiring philo&s;o|phically into the Matter.</P>
<P>I remember Mr. &mdash;, a Man of tender Af|fections, but withal a Per&s;on of excellent Un|der&s;tanding, playing one Day with a pretty Child of his own, &s;aid, that he was, ever &s;ince it was born, waiting for, and attending to that Impul&s;e or In&s;tinct, which is called natural Affection; but that all he could perceive was, that he loved it more and more from U&s;e, as he had done other Peoples Children before.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, when does this particular Attach|ment &s;eize us? If it is natural, we &s;hould per|ceive it the In&s;tant we heard the fir&s;t Cry; but, at that Time, we know nothing of the Matter. If we are &s;en&s;ible of it &s;ome Time after, it is merely owing to that Habit, which Mr. &mdash; mentioned; to that <HI>Proteus</HI> of Nature, Cu&s;tom; which has mi&s;led mo&s;t of tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers who have read Men and Manners, without having &s;tudied human Nature,&mdash;which is pretending to Phy&s;ics, without having learned Anatomy.</P>
<P>But even the In&s;tant the Child is born, would not the Parent rather your's &s;hould die than his? So he would your Hor&s;e. &mdash; The Love of Pro|perty
<PB N="256" REF="296">
is natural; but this is Part of a general Partiality, not an In&s;tance of a particular At|tachment. Men get their Pictures drawn, be|queath Fortunes to Strangers, nay, rai&s;e Obe|li&s;ks to bear their Names; but this is natural Vanity, not natural Affection.</P>
<P>If either Parent was affected with this Im|pul&s;e, let us naturally &s;u&s;pect the Mother mo&s;t, as the Child is more immediately Part of her|&s;elf, her Affections &s;ofter, and her Under&s;tand|ing weaker; and yet how little does Providence &s;eem inclined to tru&s;t to this natural In&s;tinct, by furni&s;hing her with proper Nouri&s;hment for the Child, and making it turn to Pain and Di|&s;temper, if not that Way applied, or otherwi&s;e carried off, by Methods of like Operation?</P>

<P>I HAD the Satisfaction, when I came home, of finding every Thing here &s;afe from the Storm; tho' the whole Country round me has &s;uffered infinite Damage of Hou&s;e-tops, Ricks of Hay and Stacks of Corn carried off, and Trees torn up by the Roots,&mdash;while I have forfeited but a few Slates, and &s;ome of the Branches of my Elms di&s;hevelled.

<P>As I have no Letter from you to an&s;wer, and have not been long enough in the Country to meet with any entertaining Circum&s;tances to &s;end you, the only Amu&s;ement I can give you, is from what I read; and as I am in <HI>Montaigne,</HI> which is al&s;o your Study, at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall oc|ca&s;ionally
<PB N="258" REF="298">
give you Hints of what I find remark|able in that vague, diffu&s;e, witty, and &s;en&s;ible Author.</P>
<P>In his Chapter &s;tiled <HI>Pedantry,</HI> I was plea&s;ed to find him &s;peak a great deal upon a Subject, you may remember, I am very fond of; which is, the Di&s;tinction between Learning and Wi&s;|dom. What I have to &s;ay on that Head you have heard; what he &s;ays upon it I refer you to; and &s;hall only quote one Pa&s;&s;age, becau&s;e it is whim&s;ical, and &s;omewhat in your Manner.</P>
<P>He one Day was at a Lo&s;s for accounting how &s;everal Men, of the greate&s;t Learning among his Acquaintance, were very &s;illy, weak Per&s;ons. Upon which, a lively Woman in Company &s;aid,
<Q>That in order to make Room for other Men's Sen&s;e, their own mu&s;t be &s;queezed up into &s;o narrow a Compa&s;s, as will not leave it a Power of exerting it&s;elf.</Q>
To which I &s;hall only add this Remark of my own, by Way of Illu&s;tration: That the Under&s;tanding, like a Nation, &s;hould always depend upon its own proper Force; for Auxiliaries too often make Slaves of tho&s;e they were called upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t. In &s;hort, it is owing to this &s;ervile Obedience, and blind Deference we pay to the Antients, joined to an indolent De&s;pair of excelling &s;uch great Patterns, which has almo&s;t put a Period to the Advancement of Science, or Wi&s;dom; &s;o that all the Knowledge of the Moderns is but the Learning of the Antients: In&s;omuch that,
<PB N="259" REF="299">
if you propo&s;e a Subject in natural or moral Philo&s;ophy, to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by any of the pre&s;ent Adepts in Art or Science, in&s;tead of pre&s;&s;ing forward into a Di&s;qui&s;ition of the yet inexhau&s;ted Fund of human Rea&s;on, they will poorly recur to what <HI>Archimedes, Plato,</HI> or <HI>Seneca,</HI> &s;aid upon &s;uch Matters. Here take a Quotation, by way of Parody:
<Q><L>Men &s;hould pre&s;s forward in Truth's glo|rious Chace,</L>
<L>They who look backward &s;urely lo&s;e the Race.</L></Q></P>
<P>It has been Matter of A&s;toni&s;hment to the&s;e latter Ages of the World, how the great Genii of Antiquity, at Times when Learning and Science were in their Infancy, in general, nay &s;ome of them aro&s;e in Nations confe&s;&s;edly bar|barous, could &s;hine forth with &s;uch amazing Lu&s;tre; which, far from attributing to their own natural Force, they have poorly called in the Aid of In&s;piration, to account for. What a mean and &s;tupid Expo&s;ition is this of &s;uch extraordinary Phaenomena! when the true Rea|&s;ons lie hid in the very Cau&s;es of their Admira|tion. The Mind of Man, naturally active and inqui&s;itous after Truth, not finding wherewithal to &s;atisfy its unbounded Curio&s;ity in the Dark|ne&s;s and Ignorance of the early Ages of the World, retired within it&s;elf; and, attending clo&s;ely to the Ideas in its own Bo&s;om, from whence, in Truth, all human Science and Wi&s;|dom
<PB N="260" REF="300">
is extracted, did, from &s;uch unbia&s;&s;ed Con|templation, arrive to a higher Pitch in the Age of a Man, than an Academy is able to attain to in a Century. They were certainly guilty of &s;ome gro&s;s Errors in Theory, and a manife&s;t Neglect, or Want of Method, in their Rea&s;on|ings; which has been the &s;ole Imployment of Po&s;terity, to correct the one and new model the other; nay, &s;ome of the be&s;t Critics have been &s;o infatuated with their Beauties, e&s;pecially with Regard to Poetry, that they have made Rules of their very Faults, for the Moderns to err by. In &s;hort, my Opinion of human Learning is, that it has made the Mind of Man like an over|grown Child; which, by being trammelled too long in Leading-&s;trings, and paced up and down, thro' the regular Alleys of a Parterre, is deprived of that Strength and Activity, which a free and unbounded Exerci&s;e, thro' the Fields of Nature, might make it capable of arriving at.&mdash; And here I mu&s;t remind you of my Scheme of a College, mentioned to you &s;ome Time ago: For, if a Set of Students could po&s;&s;ibly be im|proved in the Contemplation of Truth and Na|ture, without the lea&s;t Bia&s;s, or Tincture of modern Knowledge or Learning, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay to what a Height the Mind of Man is capable of attaining.</P>

<P>I SAID I would write by this Po&s;t, and, in order to fulfil my Promi&s;e, have taken up the Pen; but find that it is not in my Power to write any thing but Words; for my Thoughts are &s;o much di&s;&s;ipated by the continual Hurry I have been in, &s;ince I &s;aw you, that it would re|quire, at lea&s;t, a Week's Solitude, to reduce them to any Kind of Form; unle&s;s I were to &s;end you a little Journal, and, by that Means, treat only of the Subject I di&s;like mo&s;t, I know no other that I could think of, while I wrote three Words, &mdash; <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>you</HI> excepted.&mdash;But you indeed are one, at lea&s;t, in my Idea: And, tho' that is a Theme, to which my Thoughts for ever could attend, yet, as they are not ca|pable of Change, and have already &s;poke all the dear, in&s;piring Subject could &s;ugge&s;t, I need not refer to your Memory, for all the Sentiments of my Heart, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come.</P>
<P>As I never was happy enough to be able to, give my Opinion, from Experience, on the Sub|ject of parental Affection, I &s;hall not venture to give it at all, for more Rea&s;ons than one, as it unfortunately differs from your's.</P>

<P>My Sentiments about natural Affection do not proceed, you believe me, from a <HI>Stoical</HI> Philo&s;ophy, or the Want of an humane Di&s;po&s;i|tion; perhaps, few People feel more of Ten|derne&s;s in their Hearts, than I do, and, from a certain Softne&s;s in my Nature, tho' I have not the Appearance of it in my Manners, I often experience a fond Temper for other People's Children, which &s;ometimes their Parents are in|&s;en&s;ible of. Therefore the Arguments, I amu&s;ed the Time with, in the Letter you mention, pro|ceeded merely from a certain Method, I have always put in Practice, ever &s;ince I ventured to think for my&s;elf; which was, never to take any Opinion, or Dogma, upon the common received Notions of the World, or the <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> of the Schools, without fir&s;t making it pa&s;s thro' the Scrutiny of Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on; which is the &s;ure&s;t Way of allowing the full Value to every Virtue or Quality in human Nature.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I am jealous for the Honour or Dig|nity of Man; and would endeavour to re&s;cue

every Thing from In&s;tinct, which can be attri|buted to Reflection, or univer&s;al Benevolence. I think too, that the Doctrine of natural Af|fection has often had &s;everal very bad Con&s;e|quences attending it; in making many Chil|dren, depending on that Prejudice, behave them&s;elves more unworthily toward their Pa|rents, than they would venture to do to their Patrons; and many Fathers have left immen&s;e Fortunes to gracele&s;s Sons, from this Mi&s;take, while they have left an hone&s;t Servant, or valu|able Friend, unrewarded.</P>

<P>I AM &s;orry the Song did not plea&s;e you; but, as I have not the Misfortune to be a Con|noi&s;&s;eur, I like it mightily. I am not overbur|thened with Knowledge of any Kind, and yet I &s;incerely wi&s;h I had le&s;s; as the little I have &s;erves more to improve my Folly, than Rea&s;on, by giving me a general Di&s;reli&s;h to mo&s;t Things that I under&s;tand. For In&s;tance,&mdash;let the Words and Mu&s;ick of a Song be, like that I &s;ent you, equally bad, and I &s;hall be di&s;gu&s;t|ed with the Words, and plea&s;ed with the Tune; when, perhaps, if I under&s;tood Mu&s;ick, even as well as I do Poetry, I &s;hould not have re|ceived any Plea&s;ure from either. Query, could my under&s;tanding Crotchets and Quavers make me Amends for robbing me of Half an Hour's Entertainment?</P>
<P>Your Sentiments on natural Affection, may, for aught I know, be perfectly right; but I think it is va&s;tly more to the Honour of human Nature, to &s;uppo&s;e, that our Virtues are innate, (which is but another Name for In&s;tinct) than acquired; and it is to me quite certain, that this particularly mu&s;t proceed from hone&s;t In|&s;tinct; for the very utmo&s;t Effect, which can

<P>I am quite &s;en&s;ible of my own Incapacity to engage, on any Topick, with you, and, if ever I venture to give my Opinion on Subjects, that I neither am, nor ever &s;hall be Mi&s;tre&s;s of, it mu&s;t be owing to a &s;trong Reliance on your Indulgence, and to the Plea&s;ure, I always took, in having you for a Preceptor. There is a Kind of Pride in receiving In&s;truction from the Man I love, which compen&s;ates for the Mortification of being ignorant. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I think your Sarca&s;m rather &s;evere, than ju&s;t: For, were I even a greater Fool, than I am, it would be cruel to condemn me for being &s;o, while I make no Claim to Sen&s;e, or Knowledge; but you are welcome to &s;ay what you plea&s;e; nor am I an|gry at your being witty. There is yet another Rea&s;on, which I may offer, in Defence of my Cowardice; and is, perhaps, the mo&s;t valid of any,&mdash;the continual Hurry I have been in, ever &s;ince you left Town. While you was here, I neither &s;aw, nor went to &s;ee any Creature; of Cour&s;e, had not only many Vi&s;its, but Apo|logies to make; and the&s;e, joined to more Bu&s;i|ne&s;s than ever I was engaged in, with a thou|&s;and perplexing Circum&s;tances, have left me hardly Time to eat or &s;leep. I have fretted my|&s;elf to Death; perhaps, for Want of that Phi|lo&s;ophy,

<P>I am, this Moment, going to dine with Lady &mdash;: I have &s;pent much of my Time with her, &s;ince I &s;aw you; &s;he is indeed a true prac|tical Philo&s;opher; her Life and Manners furni&s;h as a noble Le&s;&s;on, as any to be found in the Volumes of <HI>Socrates,</HI> or <HI>Plato</HI>;&mdash;yet not even her prevailing Example, nor all the little Argu|ments, which my di&s;tracted Thoughts can mu&s;ter, have been able to reduce my Mind, even to its wonted Calm.

<P>I CANNOT give up to you the Point about natural Affection, tho' you have di&s;puted it clo&s;ely with me. You &s;ay Reflection cannot make us feel, tho' it may make us act as if we did, which is extremely ju&s;t; therefore I did not make Reflection the Cau&s;e of this Feeling, but Habit; (See my fir&s;t Letter) which, I &s;aid, &s;teals &s;o imperceptibly upon us, that we mi&s;take it for Nature; and it is &s;o near it, that it is called a &s;econd Nature.</P>
<P>I cannot think with you, that the &s;ub&s;tituting innate Ideas, in&s;tead of Rea&s;on and Reflection, would be more for the Honour of human Na|ture, tho' perhaps it would be for the Dignity of it; as a Work made perfect is more valu|able than a Work to be perfected: The Dig|nity lying in the &s;imple Nature of a Thing, but the Honour in the Perfection of it. And &s;urely <HI>Socrates,</HI> reformed from Vice, or Pa&s;&s;ion, by the Force of Philo&s;ophy, is a nobler Subject for the Honour of Mankind, than <HI>Diogenes,</HI> who was &s;aid never to have been addicted or inclined to any Humour, except that of railing. It was from this Way of thinking, that I &s;aid &s;omething to you in my la&s;t Letter, which, I am afraid, has given you &s;ome Offence. I con&s;ider|ed you as a Work, capable of Perfection, in order to rouze you to exert your&s;elf. I &s;aid, I
<PB N="269" REF="309">
often tempted you to try your Strength, or found your Depth; Was this Sarca&s;m, to allow you both Strength and Depth? In &s;hort, let this Reflection always prevent any Mi&s;take of this Kind for the Future, that I love you &s;o &s;incere|ly, and like you &s;o extremely, that I can never think or mean any Thing, which might give you offence: And, whenever I &s;ay or do any Thing which you feel your&s;elf picqued at, you may reprehend my Manners, which are, I con|fe&s;s, liable to Cen&s;ure: But blame not my Sen|timents, which are faultle&s;s, with Regard to you.</P>
<P>I did attribute your not Writing to the Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and would have wrote to you la&s;t Po&s;t, but for Fear of pre&s;&s;ing you too much, at this Time; as the Fatigue of writing every Po&s;t mu&s;t be too much for you, unle&s;s you had more retired Lei&s;ure; therefore, I will not be &s;o exact with you for the Future. I will write to you every Po&s;t, and, if you an&s;wer two, three, or four of my Letters at once, I &s;hall be &s;ati&s;|fied; being well convinced that you will not neglect it, on Account of any Employment more plea&s;ant, but from Bu&s;ine&s;s more nece&s;|&s;ary. This is what I have refu&s;ed you, ever &s;ince we were Corre&s;pondents; but have thought, at la&s;t, that taking off the Con&s;traint of a re|gular Corre&s;pondence would give a freer Air and bri&s;ker Spirit to it.

<P>MY dear <HI>Harry</HI>'s promi&s;ed Indulgence &s;hall not make me le&s;s &s;ollicitous to expre&s;s the Plea&s;ure I receive from his charming Cor|re&s;pondence, than if imagined that my Thanks were the Purcha&s;e of that Plea&s;ure. I confe&s;s that, from the fir&s;t, I have been incapable of making any other Return, and now find my&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible, le&s;s capable than ever; for, as the Value of your Letters increa&s;es every Day, or, at lea&s;t, my E&s;teem for them, con&s;cious as I am of their Worth, it would appear a high Proof of Con|fidence in me, to attempt any Thing more, than bare Acknowledgments. Accept then, my deare&s;t Love, of the warme&s;t Gratitude, which that Heart, you fir&s;t taught to feel, and that Under&s;tanding, you alone have fa&s;hioned, is capable of be&s;towing; and let my Sen&s;ibility of <HI>your</HI> Merit excu&s;e the Want of it in <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>I have not, &s;ince you left Town, had Lei|&s;ure to read a Page in <HI>Montaigne,</HI> or any other Author. I have indeed pa&s;&s;ed thro' &s;uch a Series of Hurry, Di&s;quiet, and Fatigue, that I am more than half dead; it is not to be told how much I am changed by it, but I flatter my&s;elf, that the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, and the Hopes I have of enjoying Peace and Content in the Country, will re&s;tore me to my&s;elf, or &s;omething better.</P>
<P>I am &s;till in the &s;ame di&s;agreeable Way, with Regard to my Health;&mdash;perhaps, I am va|pouri&s;h, and fancy my&s;elf wor&s;e, than I really am.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="311">I &s;aw &mdash; this Day, he &s;ays your Cough &s;till continues;&mdash;for Heaven's Sake, how can you be &s;o exce&s;&s;ively ill-natured, as not to take &s;ome Care of your&s;elf? You mu&s;t, on this Occa&s;ion, give me Leave to remind you of that noble&s;t Part of <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Philo&s;ophy, which your favou|rite Author mentions:&mdash;
<Q>He that loves not his Wife, or Friend &s;o well, as to prolong his Health for them, but will ob&s;tinately die, is too delicate and effeminate; the Soul mu&s;t impo&s;e this on it&s;elf, when the Utility of our Friends does &s;o require it; it is a Te&s;timony of Grandeur and Courage, to pre&s;erve one's Life, for the Con&s;ideration of another, when a Man perceives that this Office is plea&s;ing, agreeable, or u&s;eful to &s;ome Per&s;on, by whom we are tenderly beloved.</Q></P>
<P>Taking this for granted, what Judgment am I to form of your Affection for me, who have &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ollicited you to apply the proper Means for &s;urmounting that na&s;ty, ob&s;tinate, ill-natured Cough? If it were only from a De&s;ire of conquering any Thing &s;o perver&s;e, I would get the better of it. I hope this Con&s;ideration will have more Weight, than any other I have been able to offer; for, alas!
<Q>my Advocation is not now in Tune.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your <HI>Laconic</HI> Epi&s;tle, which I could wi&s;h had been &s;till &s;horter, as far as it men|tions your being out of Order. I am my&s;elf a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle unwell, from drinking the&s;e three Days pa&s;t; and it mu&s;t be a very irk&s;ome Reflection, not to be able to recollect any one Enjoyment, of which my pre&s;ent Pain was the Purcha&s;e; for Drinking, in general, you know I hate; and yet I would rather have drank alone, than in the Company I debauched with. Do not think me conceited in this Speech, for I really look upon it rather as an Imperfection than a Refinement, that &s;o few People are agreeable to my Ta&s;te; as it is the Sign of a depraved Appetite, not to be able to reli&s;h plain and &s;imple Meats. The Men of half, or quarter Under&s;tandings, di&s;gu&s;t me mo&s;t; and mere Fools I can live tolerably well with, provided they be good-humoured; tho' a good-humoured Fool may be compared to a fine Day in Winter, which keeps us all the While in Pain with the Fear of lo&s;ing it, as it has not a Sea&s;on to &s;upport it. It is Sen&s;e alone, which can give Con&s;tancy to Chearfulne&s;s or Virtue.</P>
<P>My Di&s;reli&s;h to Company is a good deal ow|ing to a certain &s;plenetic Ca&s;t of Mind, which I have contracted from &s;ome Mortifications and Di&s;appointments, I have formerly met with,
<PB N="273" REF="313">
joined to &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es I, at pre&s;ent, labour under; which evil Habit, as I am well aware of, I &s;hall endeavour to get the better of, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible: For, &s;hould I &s;uffer &s;uch a Humour as this to grow upon me, it might render me incapable of enjoying the Favours, which, per|haps, Fortune has in Store for me; and would be as ab&s;urd, as unmanning one's &s;elf, upon be|ing cro&s;&s;ed in Love.</P>
<P>You have, my charming Girl, a good deal to an&s;wer for, with Regard to my Di&s;reli&s;h of Conver&s;ation, in general, and are likely to in|crea&s;e the Evil every Day: For your Ta&s;te and Under&s;tanding improves con&s;tantly; or, to &s;peak more properly, is more illu&s;trated: For I be|lieve that, in Proportion as my Sen&s;e improves, or Ta&s;te refines, I may be &s;aid rather to di&s;co|ver new Beauties, than you to acquire them. Here I &s;hall ob&s;erve to you, what you have &s;ome|times upbraided me with, that I did not &s;eem to increa&s;e in my Love for you, from the fir&s;t Time I declared my Regards. Which Ob&s;ervation is true enough; for my Love was perfect, at fir&s;t, as I e&s;teemed and valued you, not only for what you then were, but by a Prae-&s;entiment for what you would be. Like a &s;kilful Lapidary, I valued the Jewel in the Stone; thinking the Poli&s;hing could add but an incon&s;iderable Value to intrin|&s;ic Worth.</P>

<P>I DO not believe there are any Words, that can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;cribe the Situation of my Mind: I think, I want but a &s;mall Matter to render me as incapable of feeling, as I am of expre&s;&s;ing it; but as I,

my Heart received a momentary Calm from your dear Letter; and,

You, doubt|le&s;s, expect that I &s;hould a&s;&s;ign &s;ome Rea&s;on for the extraordinary Emotion I have mentioned, but it ari&s;es from &s;uch a Multiplicity of odd Cir|cum&s;tances, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me even to recollect the thou&s;andth Part of them. In &s;hort, my Memory, tho' contrary to your Opinion, accompanied what little Under&s;tand|ing I had, and they are both marched off to|gether. Whoever finds, may take them for their Pains, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to claim them. There is no body doubts the Mind's Suffering with the Body; and I po&s;itively affirm, that the Body returns the Compliment; for I am, at this In&s;tant, &s;o extremely ill, and tremble &s;o vio|lently, that I can hardly hold the Pen.

<P>THAT I have &s;hewn you any Beauties in your Poem, which you ob&s;erved not be|fore, is owing to the Eye not &s;eeing it&s;elf, but by Reflection; and, like a Mirrour, have barely reported the Form, not capable of improving it,
<PB N="276" REF="316">
But I have this Advantage in the Simile, that the Sub&s;tance of your dear Image &s;hall always remain with me, tho' the Shadow of it &s;hould be vani&s;hed.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; As learned Commentators view</L>
<L>More Things in <HI>Homer,</HI> that e'er <HI>Homer</HI> knew:</L></Q>
<P>So it is the Character of all Per&s;ons of Genius to &s;ay Things, the Beauties of which they were not aware of: For, as all Truth, Harmony, and Order are but the Expre&s;&s;ions of the innate Ideas of a perfect Mind, it is natural for the human Soul, exerted to its proper Force, to hint, uncon&s;cious, at Science or Philo&s;ophy, which it had never learned or thought of. The utmo&s;t of my Art can but explain your Wit or Sen&s;e, not improve them; and, as indeed you have more of both, than it is po&s;&s;ible your Youth and Inexperience &s;hould have Skill enough to find out, it &s;hall be henceforth my plea&s;ing Ta&s;k to make that <HI>Mine</HI> current, which &s;hines by U&s;e, and, like other Trea&s;ures, increa&s;es by Communication.</P>
<P>I do not recollect what Lines of mine you hint at; if you mention them more particularly, I &s;hall &s;end them, to &s;hew my Obedience, even after your's.</P>
<P>I am &s;till in the &s;ame Study of <HI>Montaigne,</HI> and have begun him again, in the old Edition I had formerly by me; as, perhaps, that may give me Light into &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, which are very ob|&s;curely
<PB N="277" REF="317">
tran&s;lated in the new one; and the Pre&s;s of this is al&s;o the mo&s;t imperfect, I ever &s;aw, of any Book. The Errors, which the Sen&s;e can &s;et you right in, are not material; but there are &s;ome very unlucky ones, which lead you quite a&s;tray from the Subject; as, particularly, <HI>unite</HI> for <HI>untye, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> which I mention to put you on your Guard, as you go thro' it.</P>
<P>I declare, I never received more Plea&s;ure or Satisfaction from any Author, in my Life, than this. He has a thorough Knowledge of the World and human Nature, and more Wit than all the Epigrams which were ever wrote; and many poetical Flights, which the be&s;t Ver&s;e, I ever read, might be proud to own. He has a Sen&s;e, which I am fond of, more improved by Thought and Reflection, than Study or Learn|ing; an Under&s;tanding free from Prejudice, and a Judgment formed from a natural Di&s;cernment, and not framed upon the Doctrines or Opinions of others.</P>
<P>His Sentiments are every-where ju&s;t and no|ble, and there is a certain Freedom in his Stile, and Boldne&s;s in his Expre&s;&s;ion, which are &s;trong enough to break even thro' both his Tran&s;lators. As for what I have heard &s;ome &s;mall Critics cavil at, that he is always talking of him&s;elf, is it improper to &s;peak about what he profe&s;&s;edly makes his Subject? He treats of human Na|ture in general, &mdash; then him&s;elf ought to be his particular Study: What he &s;ays of others, he
<PB N="278" REF="318">
can only gue&s;s at, but what he &s;ays of him&s;elf, he may be &s;ure of. He &s;peaks often too gro&s;sly, it is &s;aid; and it is certain he does,&mdash;but then the Freedom of his De&s;criptions, and Expre&s;&s;i|ons in tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, are only &s;hocking to tho&s;e to whom the Study of Anatomy would be ob|&s;cene. In &s;hort, I highly e&s;teem his Writings, and greatly honour his Memory.</P>
<P>In his &s;hort E&s;&s;ay upon mon&s;trous Births, which I read over this Morning, he makes a very fine Ob&s;ervation, which has amu&s;ed me greatly,&mdash;that, perhaps, what we look upon as Mon&s;ters, may not be really &s;o in the Eye of Providence; for nothing can be contrary to Nature, unle&s;s we mi&s;take Cu&s;tom, as I have &s;aid before is often done, for Nature; and the&s;e heteroclite Creatures may, perhaps, have Rela|tion to a Species of the &s;ame Kind, unknown to Man. I am particularly plea&s;ed with his philo&s;ophick Turn of Thought, as it takes off greatly from the Offence, which &s;uch ob&s;cene Sights naturally,&mdash;I mean, u&s;ually give us. This Sentiment I &s;hall extend farther, with re|lation to tho&s;e extraordinary Spirits in Virtue, or Science, who &s;eem to excel Mankind, as if they were of a higher Species, and may, per|haps, have Relation to a nobler Rank of Beings; but &s;ent down a Cla&s;s, or more, lower, for &s;ome Offence in their former State; and obliged to earn their Way up again to their lo&s;t Dignity; according to a Di&s;cipline, I &s;omewhere read of
<PB N="279" REF="319">
and was plea&s;ed with, in an Army, where the greate&s;t Officer, upon any Error, or Breach of his Duty, was degraded to &s;ome inferior Sta|tion, according to his Fault, and &s;o reduced to fight his Way back again to his forfeited Rank. Or, perhaps, the&s;e rare Genii are now and then dropped among us, to rai&s;e our Emulation in Virtue or Knowledge; or, it may be, to hint to us Mortals, that the ordinary Race of Man is not the greate&s;t Work of God; which, how|ever, a very little Reflection upon Providence might convince us of; for God, as it has been el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved, all-powerful, may not re&s;t at a Creature &s;o imperfect, as Man.</P>

<P>THE Story, I hinted to you in a late Letter, was, in great Mea&s;ure, the Cau&s;e of the exce&s;&s;ive Lowne&s;s of Spirits, you chide me for. I am mortified at the In&s;incerity and Ingratitude of &s;ome People, on whom I had a &s;trong De|pendence; particularly, Lady &mdash;; her ve|hement Profe&s;&s;ions and contemptible Behaviour have &s;erved to illu&s;trate my real Opinion, that Sen&s;e and Virtue are the only &s;olid Foundation for Love and Friend&s;hip. I am ab&s;olutely a|mazed, and angry at my&s;elf, for being duped by &s;uch a Woman.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="320">But, in order to &s;et her Behaviour in a much &s;tronger Light, I have, in my Acquaintance with Lady <HI>O</HI>&mdash;, found &s;uch a Contra&s;t, as is not to be de&s;cribed. In&s;tead of an Affectation of Sen&s;e and Virtue in the one, the Actions of the other &s;peak the full Force of both; Dignity, without Pride, good Humour, without Folly, Wit, without Satire, Charity, without O&s;ten|tation, and Philo&s;ophy, with the extreme&s;t Quickne&s;s of Under&s;tanding and Tenderne&s;s of Heart, are all joined in the amiable Compo&s;i|tion of that unaffectedly, good Woman.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I had fini&s;hed the la&s;t Line, her Chair came for me: I have been with her three Hours, and would not have quitted her now, for any other Plea&s;ure, but that of returning to my dear <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>She has indeed calmed my Mind extremely, by that ju&s;t Method of rea&s;oning, &s;he is per|fectly Mi&s;tre&s;s of, joined to &s;uch Prai&s;es, as, from any other, would look like Adulation, but, from her Mouth, are high Reward. I hope my dear <HI>Harry</HI> will excu&s;e my dwelling &s;o long on a Subject, my Heart is &s;o much intere&s;ted in, as it overflows with Gratitude to one, who will not even &s;uffer an Attempt to expre&s;s it.</P>
<P>My &s;incere&s;t Thanks are your's, for con&s;ent|ing lately to my &s;o often repeated Reque&s;t; you may indeed be &s;atisfied, that no Avocation more plea&s;ant will ever interfere with my Part of our Corre&s;pondence; a&s;&s;ured of this, that I would

give up every Thing, that is called Plea&s;ure in this World, for the real one, I enjoy, in con|ver&s;ing with you.&mdash;Oh! when &s;hall I have that Happine&s;s, without Allay?&mdash;</P>
<P>I was not picqued at your not &s;uppo&s;ing me capable of entering the Li&s;ts of Logick with you, but at your &s;eeming to gibe at my Want of Capacity; which, you know, is a Misfor|tune, and not a Fault. You &s;ay, you
<Q>did not mean it &s;o:</Q>
&mdash;I will believe it, fir&s;t, becau&s;e you &s;ay it; and next, becau&s;e I am too low-&s;pirited to be angry, if you had meant to make me &s;o.</P>
<P>Perhaps, my pre&s;ent Dejection is the Cau&s;e of my fancying my&s;elf in a bad State of Health; but, from a Cough, which has never left me, &s;ince you did, and a continued Pain acro&s;s my Che&s;t, I imagine my&s;elf going into a Con|&s;umption. I &s;incerely hope, I am mi&s;taken; for, indeed, I do not wi&s;h to part with thee. I intend con&s;ulting Doctor <HI>Daw&s;on</HI>; when I do, you &s;hall know his Opinion. 'Till then, and ever, be a&s;&s;ured, the Bitterne&s;s of Death hath not a Pang, but what the Lo&s;s of thee will give. I find my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a gloomy Ten|derne&s;s, as you, certainly, will be angry at.&mdash; Oh! my Heart's Trea&s;ure, forgive that &s;elfi&s;h Weakne&s;s, which laments thy Ab&s;ence; for Joy and thou are one!</P>
<P>For Heaven's Sake, burn this Letter. I am &s;trongly tempted to write another, but, if I
<PB N="282" REF="322">
&s;hould, perhaps it would be as fooli&s;h,&mdash;&s;o e'en let it go!</P>
<P>I &s;hould complain of your having wrote oftener to <HI>Kitty,</HI> than me; and, by that Means, &s;eeming more anxious about the Bu&s;ine&s;s of her Fortunes, than my Happine&s;s; but, by making an Apology, you have acknowledged a Fault; which is all, I ever required, to render my For|givene&s;s ab&s;olute.</P>
<P>Adieu! my deare&s;t, be&s;t-loved, fir&s;t, and only Friend! may that Happine&s;s, which I think you merit, and &s;incerely wi&s;h you, ever attend you!</P>

<SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;uffered my Affairs to run into great Confu&s;ion, by my two la&s;t Journies to <HI>Lon|don</HI>; for I have not been here the&s;e four Months. I have been at a va&s;t Expence, and nothing done as I directed.&mdash;How much I want the &s;weet Support of your charming Conver&s;e, at pre&s;ent, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, at once, from Spleen and Labour! two Things, which never at the &s;ame Time afflicted any Per&s;on, who was not as whim&s;ically compounded, as my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="324">However, I have brought my favourite <HI>Mon|taigne</HI> with me, for I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf alone; and, tho' I am inamoured of Solitude, yet I never retire, but in order to chu&s;e my Com|pany; which I cannot always do, when I live in the World. Some <HI>Dramatis Per&s;ona</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>Death is the being born to <HI>Plato</HI>'s and to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s.</Q>
Then &s;ure a philo&s;ophical Solitude is to live with them. There is this flattering Difference between the World and a Library, that there you are &s;ubject to every Fool's Hu|mour, here you can make every Wit &s;ubject to your's. It is &s;aid, that a Man mu&s;t be a God, or a Brute, who can live alone: Be it &s;o! but &s;urely the Contemplation of Virtue, Truth, and Nature, being the highe&s;t Entertainment of An|gels, may enable a philo&s;ophick Mind to &s;up|port Retirement, without Hanging, or Drown|ing. Mere Solitude, or even the mo&s;t learned Lei&s;ure, is &s;aid to unqualify a Man for the Com|merce, or even the Conver&s;ation of the World; and perhaps it does;&mdash;but this Objection is only from them to you, not from you to your&s;elf. Dancing may be a nece&s;&s;ary Accompli&s;hment for the Stage, but why &s;hall a Man practi&s;e Coupees, who only means to walk? Such Hints as the&s;e &s;hould make a virtuous Mind the more inamoured of Fields and Groves; for &s;ure it is a high Recommendation of Truth and Hone&s;ty, that the fir&s;t would di&s;appoint a Courtier's Pre|ferment, and the latter mar an Attorney's For|tune.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="325">I read over a long Chapter in <HI>Montaigne</HI> Ye&s;|terday, ab&s;urdly &s;tiled, <HI>of Cruelty</HI>; for the Sub|ject is entirely on Virtue. I think this E&s;&s;ay by much the be&s;t of all his Works, and well worth frequent Reading. I don't know whether any Thing, he has &s;aid, is the Occa&s;ion of this Ob&s;ervation occurring to me, but I have often thought, that the Writers both upon Religion, and Morality, have &s;aid enough about Virtue and Vice; yet have not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed between Vice and Vice; which would be a more u&s;eful Critici&s;m, as le&s;s obvious. I am realy afraid that &s;ome of the Works of our learned Divines have hardened more People thro' De&s;pair, than ever they reclaimed by Re|pentance; proceeding too much upon a literal Con&s;truction of that Text,
<Q>He who is guilty of the Breach of any Part of the Law, is guilty of the Whole.</Q>
Which is a Doctrine as &s;evere again&s;t God, as again&s;t Man.&mdash;For, then, who was born to be &s;aved? My Opinion is, that, as there is no Vice, which the Frailty of human Nature may not be led into; &s;o there is no Crime, which the Divine Nature will not pardon, and the mo&s;t irreligious Crime is the De&s;pairing of that Pardon. The Chri&s;tian Re|ligion goes Hand in Hand with the Weakne&s;s of human Nature; and the very Doctrine of Repentance, without which no Man can be perfect, &s;uppo&s;es us to have erred. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was a Pattern given us to imitate, not to equal.
<PB N="286" REF="326">
However, when our Saviour wi&s;hes the bitter Cup to pa&s;s by him, and makes that frail Eja|culation, <HI>Eli, Eli, lama &s;abacthani!</HI> he &s;eems to &s;uffer with more Weakne&s;s, than many Mortals have betrayed in Death or Torments. But &s;urely this was to abate the Vain-glory of <HI>Stoic|i&s;m,</HI> to humble the Pride of Self-&s;ufficiency, and to &s;hew us that God, who made us, as we are, indulges human Weakne&s;&s;es even in the mo&s;t perfect Man.</P>
<P>Farewel, my charming Sinner! and I wi&s;h I had half your Virtues to attone for even all my Frailties.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> HARRY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved, &s;ince you left Town, that the Letters, which have pa&s;&s;ed between us, have not had the lea&s;t Air of a Corre&s;pon|dence. Your's, indeed, are infinitely &s;uperior to any Thing I have ever &s;een under that De|nomination, being regular fini&s;hed E&s;&s;ays; while mine have been mere Acknowledgments for the Receipt of &s;uch a Trea&s;ure. And, if, at any Time, I have chanced to vary from the u&s;ual Form, and given Expre&s;&s;ion to my own Thoughts, which are only filled with Tender|ne&s;s for you, you have not deigned to take the lea&s;t Notice of them. To illu&s;trate this Truth,
<PB N="287" REF="327">
can any Thing be more extraordinary, than your addre&s;&s;ing your An&s;wer, to the mo&s;t im|portant Concern of my Life, to <HI>Kitty</HI>; yet write to me by the &s;ame Po&s;t, without ever mention|ing it? However, the Means cannot rob me of the Plea&s;ure, I take, in knowing you are well.</P>
<P>Whatever Effect Spleen may have on my Mind, I do a&s;&s;ure you my Body, without that, is much di&s;ordered: But I hope every Thing from clear Air, Regularity, and Content; none of which I have the lea&s;t Expectation of enjoy|ing in <HI>London,</HI> tho' I believe I &s;hall not go above five or &s;ix Miles from it, in Pur&s;uit of them all. My Scheme, with Regard to <HI>Hert|ford&s;hire,</HI> is quite changed, &mdash; but more of this, when we meet. You flatter me with the Hopes of &s;eeing you&mdash;Do you really think of coming? Tell me, and when?</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. &mdash; have left Town. Mr. &mdash; goes to <HI>Ireland</HI> next <HI>Monday:</HI> I am ju&s;t going to bid him Adieu. Indeed I &s;hall be the mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate of all Mortals, left among tho&s;e, who &s;erve only to debar me of the Plea|&s;ures of Solitude, and remind me of the Ab&s;ence of them I love. I dete&s;t going abroad, yet mu&s;t be obliged to it; for it will be impo&s;&s;ible to bear Home without a Companion, or the Liberty of Reading: Which la&s;t, &s;hould I attempt, would not only be impracticable, but explained into an Act of the highe&s;t Di&s;regard and Ingratitude, by my Aunt.&mdash;Is not this a plea&s;ant Situation?</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="328">I have read &s;ix or &s;even Chapters of <HI>Mon|taigne</HI>; but, as I read regularly, am not come to that, you lately mentioned, on <HI>Cruelty.</HI> I like him va&s;tly, and have a Kind of Plea&s;ure in recalling the Ideas he in&s;pired me with &s;ome Years ago. I am a&s;hamed, and &s;orry to tell you, that I think my Under&s;tanding and Judg|ment were infinitely &s;uperior, even in my childi&s;h Days, to what they are at pre&s;ent. I can only account for it by my Thoughts being more di&s;|&s;ipated, and eagerly engaged in a Variety of Pur&s;uits, than they then were: And, there be|ing, at fir&s;t, but a &s;light Foundation, it was in|tirely de&s;troyed in the Divi&s;ion. I will not ex|patiate farther on tho&s;e Merits, which, as I no longer po&s;&s;e&s;s them, may appear to you quite imaginary; but &s;hall build all my Hopes of your Regard on <HI>one,</HI> which neither Time nor Chance can alter&mdash;that of being &s;incerely and affection|ately</P>

<P>HOW could you take me to Ta&s;k &s;o un|fairly as you did, about my Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, with Regard to your Inquiries? Recollect your|&s;elf of my Letter to <HI>Kitty,</HI> you'll find, when I had &s;ealed mine to you, that Po&s;t, <HI>George</HI> brought me your Letter from &mdash;. I was then writ|ing to <HI>Kitty</HI> about Bu&s;ine&s;s, and I thought the Account of my Health would come as quickly
<PB N="289" REF="329">
to you by a Paragraph in her Letter, as if I had broke open a Seal, to inform you of it in your's. This would have been &s;uch a Piece of Forma|lity, as I would be very &s;orry, we were upon Terms to require. As for the critical and phi|lo&s;ophical Subjects of my Letters, which you &s;o genteely reprimand, let me make this Apology for them: That they never once diverted me from an&s;wering, and ob&s;erving upon every &s;ingle Paragraph of your Letters; and I only e&s;&s;ay my own Fund, when I have nothing better to com|ment upon.</P>
<P>Your Ob&s;ervation upon di&s;agreable Company is very pretty, and ju&s;t. They de&s;troy the Plea|&s;ures of Solitude, but leave us the irk&s;ome Part of it; which is, the Remembrance of our ab|&s;ent Friends; and this too in a &s;tronger Man|ner than when alone, by affording us an Oppor|tunity of Compari&s;on. I am &s;ure you make a provoking Compari&s;on between your former and pre&s;ent Under&s;tanding; and the Rea&s;on that you thought better of the fir&s;t, was, becau&s;e it was the weake&s;t. Our Humility increa&s;es in Pro|portion to our Sen&s;e and Knowledge A Per|&s;on in a Valley is in&s;en&s;ible of the narrow Cir|cumference of his Sight; but mounting up the Hill, the Extent of Pro&s;pect betrays the &s;hort Limits of that Sen&s;e. If you will re&s;t your Opi|nion upon my Judgment in this Matter, be a&s;|&s;ured that I never &s;aid any Thing either of your Sen&s;e, Wit, Ta&s;te, or other Merits, that I

<HEAD>LETTER CXLVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> FANNY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lines you de&s;ire, are not worth &s;end|ing; but to write good Ver&s;es is one Thing, and to obey is another; &s;o, according to your Commands, take what follows.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="blank"></P>
<P>A vile Phra&s;e, and wor&s;e Matter! but both preferable to the Subject. I &s;u&s;pect the&s;e were not the Lines, you enquired for; and fancy tho&s;e wrote in &mdash; were what you meant; tho' I believe I gave you them before. They had &s;ome Spirit it them, but alluded to &s;ecret Hi&s;tory &s;o much, that they could not be under&s;tood without a Comment, which I &s;hall never give.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to Pro&s;e, for I look upon Ver&s;e, I mean Rhyme, to be &s;uch a Device for reading or writing, as the jingling Bells, which our Carters u&s;e, that are &s;uppo&s;ed to en|courage
<PB N="291" REF="331">
their Brutes to labour with more Chear|fulne&s;s; and I &s;hall ever honour that Critick, in the Cla&s;s of fal&s;e Ta&s;te, who &s;aid that <HI>Milton</HI> wanted only the Ornament of Rhyme, to ren|der him perfect. Such a Genius would cut all the Trees of a Fore&s;t into Pyramids, and fa|&s;hion Mount <HI>Athos</HI> into the Figure of a Man; as was projected once by <HI>Alexander,</HI> and &s;hew the Power of Art, by it's. Violence upon Na|ture.</P>
<P>To give you my Opinion of Rhyme, I look upon Puns to be a Species of it, as they are a Jingling of Words, and a Tinkling of Sounds. Indeed, tho&s;e, who can write like you, may be excu&s;ed, where the real Beauties of Poety ren|der the Reader in&s;en&s;ible to the Crambo; but then this Apology is &s;uch a one, as is made for the Quibbling of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> that the fal&s;e Re|li&s;h of the Age required &s;uch a Conde&s;cen&s;ion. You u&s;e Ver&s;e, as you do Cloaths; not for the Ornament, but in Compliance to Cu&s;tom; and not becau&s;e you have one Blemi&s;h to cover, but becau&s;e you can afford to hide many Beau|ties.</P>
<P>I left &mdash; this Morning, not that I had fi|ni&s;hed my Bu&s;ine&s;s there, but becau&s;e I had read out the only Book I had with me; and was then expo&s;ed to the Mercy of the Winds and Rains, which have been very &s;evere there this Week.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="332">The only Fault, I find in <HI>Montaigne,</HI> is the Profu&s;ion of Quotations, he inter&s;per&s;es thro' all his Works. It is nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes to il|lu&s;trate our Rea&s;onings by Examples; but the&s;e &s;hould be drawn from our own Ob&s;ervations, rather than the Sentiments of others. When we treat of Death, Immortality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> why need we produce the Opinions of <HI>Plato,</HI> or <HI>Seneca,</HI> upon the&s;e Subjects? We dare not depend on our own Strength, but lean upon others, and often &s;upport weak Judgments by the Force of Authority. This is one of the Rea&s;ons we make &s;uch &s;low Progre&s;s, of late, in Science, or Philo|&s;ophy; for we follow one another in &s;uch beaten Tracks, that our View cannot be extended far|ther than to the Per&s;on, who goes before us; and are afraid of turning to the Right, or Left, le&s;t we &s;hould lo&s;e our Way. I am &s;o di&s;ati&s;|fied with Quotations, that I run into the con|trary Extreme, and endeavour to avoid them, as much as others do to bring them in; in&s;o|much, that I often &s;hun the very Thoughts, which naturally occur to me in writing, or &s;peaking, if I recollect they have been made u&s;e of, upon the &s;ame Occa&s;ion before. This is, perhaps, an Affection greater than the other; and may fall under the Cen&s;ure objected to Writings of this Kind, that tho&s;e, who will not conde&s;cend to &s;ay any Thing, which has been &s;aid before them; will, probably, never &s;ay any Thing, which will be quoted after them. But this la&s;t
<PB N="293" REF="333">
Nicety, perhaps, I owe to my Corre&s;pondence with you, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of Plagia|ri&s;m; as you have read every Thing, which I am capable of Under&s;tanding; yet I have a more humble Rea&s;on for avoiding Quotations; that I don't care to give People an Opportunity of making Compari&s;ons to my Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>There is a Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Montaigne,</HI> which I am particularly flattered with, becau&s;e it puts me in Mind of a bold Expre&s;&s;ion and Sentiment of mine, in a former Letter to you;
<Q>that I had &s;o compleat a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of you, that I enjoy|ed your very Ab&s;ence,</Q>
or Words to that Purpo&s;e. Speaking of a Friend, he loved, he &s;ays,
<Q>A Corre&s;pondence de&s;troys Ab&s;ence, as it gives us a Liberty of conver&s;ing together. We better filled, and extended the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Life, in being parted. He lived, rejoiced, and &s;aw for me, and I for him, as plainly as if he had him&s;elf been there. One Part re|mained idle, and we confounded one another, when we were together. Di&s;tance of Place rendered the Conjunction of our Wills more rich. The in&s;atiable De&s;ire of per&s;onal Pre&s;ence &s;omewhat implies Weakne&s;s in the Fruition of Souls.</Q>
Nothing can he more finely ima|gined, or better expre&s;&s;ed, than this whole Pa&s;|&s;age; after which, I will not venture to add any Thing of my own, but conclude in his Words:

I don't care that you &s;hould divide your&s;elf between your common Acquaintance, and me; and am &s;uch a Churl, that I have no Enjoyment either of your Con|ver&s;ation, or Corre&s;pondence, but when I have them entirely to my&s;elf.</P>
<Q><HI>Adam</HI> relating, &s;he &s;ole Auditre&s;s.</Q>
<P>When I write to you, my whole Soul is yours. I am not however &s;o &s;elfi&s;h, or rather, I am &s;o &s;elfi&s;h, as to be willing to communicate your charming Conver&s;e to tho&s;e few, who have a ju&s;t Reli&s;h for your Wit and Sen&s;e; for this is but enlarging my own Capacity, and increa&s;ing my Comprehen&s;ion, which is too narrow, to enjoy the Fullne&s;s of the Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>If I appear to have a better Philo&s;ophy, or more refined Sen&s;e than formerly, it is but to accommodate my&s;elf to your Sentiments and Ta&s;te; which, by the Continuance of your Favour, may perhaps &s;trengthen Habit into Nature. However, in general, I endeavour to

appear to you, what I really in my&s;elf am; be|cau&s;e I cannot be otherwi&s;e a&s;&s;ured either of your Love, or E&s;teem. I am certain that, by &s;hewing my&s;elf in this Light, I may le&s;&s;en both: But then I &s;ecure tho&s;e Portions of each, which I may hone&s;tly, or prudently claim.

And would be a Sort of Weaning you from your Attachments to me, as if a Pea&s;ant-lover &s;hould endeavour to in&s;pire his <HI>Amaryllis</HI> with high Notions of Pomp, Riches, and Grandeur.</P>
<P>All the Hazard, I run, from my free Com|merce with you, is that, as Pre&s;umption, and Self-&s;ufficiency are apt to get the Start of Sen&s;e, or Knowledge, your Prai&s;e and Approbation may give me &s;uch a Vanity, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed antient Heroes with an Opinion of their being more than Human, but that the Charms of your Per|&s;on tempt me often to recollect my Manhood.
