<P>THE pre&s;ent to Mr. Rich procured me an in|vitation to dine with him, which favour I did not accept, but paid my devoirs to him at his morn|ing levees.&mdash;My old ma&s;ter, Rich, one day &s;aid to me, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mu&s;ter William&s;kin,</HI> you are much im|proved &s;ince I fir&s;t began to <HI>larn</HI> you; I think I mu&s;t engage you.&mdash;Name your terms."</Q> I then propo&s;ed (on that hint) a plan for &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">mber of nights rather than for the &s;ea&s;on:&mdash;He in&s;tantly agreed, and Mr. Foote's Minor was fixed on for immediate preparation; nay, he deigned to de&s;ire me to ca&s;t the parts, I was in &s;uch &s;udden favour; as he &s;aid, with truth, he knew nothing of <HI>Mu&s;ter Footy's</HI> farce. Mrs. Rich was a Methodi&s;t,&mdash;not that I mention it as a recommendation, or that &s;he was a better Chri&s;tian for bowing at the &s;hrin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="4" REF="4">
of Non&s;en&s;e and Hypocri&s;y.&mdash;Mr. Foote's la&s;h on Methodi&s;m at that time was &s;everely felt by that &s;ect; their compo&s;ition is gloom, melancholy, en|vy, and &s;pleen; cheerfulne&s;s is &s;eldom ob&s;erved to dawn on their countenances. Notwith&s;tand|ing their boa&s;ted in&s;pirations, if Methodi&s;t preachers had a little reflection, what mu&s;t they think of daring to pronounce every theatre the devil's hou&s;e, and all the players the devil's children! I hope they are joking:&mdash;and though it may be joking, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it is wicked. To make a complete actor requires more requi&s;ites to uni|ver&s;ally excel than almo&s;t any other profe&s;&s;ion whatever.</P>
<P>The amazing powers di&s;played by a Garrick, a Barry, a Mrs. Cibber, and a Siddons, and many others, is evidently the hand of God:&mdash;He alone could give the fini&s;h to &s;uch intrin&s;ic merit. And that the Almighty has intended them for that very work is evident; which, if not &s;o produced, the world would have lo&s;t &s;eeing the highe&s;t pitch of admiration the human frame can a&s;pire to. To mention Shak&s;peare only, proves more than all the before-mentioned per&s;ons, as he is a ho&s;t, and &s;tands unequalled, as a moral writer, in many points, as well the wonder of the world, as an uni|ver&s;al genius.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
I do not wi&s;h to in&s;inuate that <HI>every Methodi&s;t</HI> is an hypocrite, but I mean that I think the greate&s;t part are really &s;o:&mdash;So of the preachers, I believe, there are &s;ome in earne&s;t, though I fear the num|ber might be ea&s;ily told. When per&s;ons get to the height of a Whitfield and a We&s;ley's fame for acting, there is a pride as well as a duty in behav|ing well; and they both laboured hard: but I dare &s;ay neither of tho&s;e gentlemen ever refu&s;ed a golden ticket for their &s;eparate benefits any more than I ever did?&mdash;O yes, <HI>I</HI> actually did <HI>once refu&s;e five guineas</HI> at York! but I was <HI>mode&s;t</HI> and re|jected it; I expected it to be offered a &s;econd time&mdash;It was not; what then? Why then I was <HI>di&s;appointed,</HI> and never will be &s;o fooli&s;h again, if opportunity offers.&mdash;Let one of the tabernacle boa&s;t the &s;ame&mdash;they know better&mdash;and that a bird in hand is worth two in the bu&s;h. But, O ye &s;aints of your own creating! I will preach to you&mdash;Mark! <HI>Judge not of plays and players, le&s;t</HI> you <HI>be judged.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t cen&s;orious on the in|firmities of others, are u&s;ually mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly guilty of far greater failings them&s;elves; and &s;anc|tified Methodi&s;tical &s;lander is, of all, the mo&s;t &s;e|vere, bitter, and cruel, and is &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, unle&s;s by the elect, that it is not worth while dwelling any longer upon it.</P>

In the comedy of the Hypocrite the Colonel &s;ays, he &s;uppo&s;es they go to the play for the be|nefit of the brethren:&mdash;Cantwell an&s;wers, <Q REND="inline">"The charity covereth the &s;in:"</Q>&mdash;which was actually the ca&s;e; for in the year 1757, as Shuter was bountiful to the tabernacle, Mr. Whitfield not only permitted, but advi&s;ed his hearers to attend Shuter's benefit; but <HI>(a-la-mode theatre)</HI> for that night only.</P>
<P>A preacher at Hull was once in di&s;tre&s;s and im|pri&s;oned; I actually &s;ent him a leg of mutton and turneps: previous to that I had been an atten|dant at his tabernacle; he entertained great hopes of my conver&s;ion, and I certainly confe&s;s to the being wicked enough to have been deemed a to|lerable Methodi&s;t. I had then quitted the old playhou&s;e in Lowgate for a new one in Finkle-&s;treet. That the principal performers of con|venticles love to follow the &s;mell of a theatre is evident, by their particularly con&s;ecrating tho&s;e un|hallowed &s;hops, and thinking them enviable &s;itu|ations to practi&s;e their own love-fea&s;ts in&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Put out the light, and then&mdash;"</Q> So this Rev.

<P>AS your engagements in public and mine run counter, I did not know when to wait on you as to a proper &s;ea&s;on; and therefore as you were &s;o good and &s;ympathi&s;ing to act from &s;uch a noble &s;pirit of humanity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as propo&s;ing to take a pew in my chapel in Lowgate, I &s;hall leave the&s;e four be&s;t pews to the genero&s;ity of the per&s;ons that engage; &s;o whoever leads the way will be a pattern for the others. I ve|rily think, without the lea&s;t flattery, that your encouragement of &s;uch things will be &s;uch an honour to the &s;tage, and be&s;peak the fame to the comedians, as will perpetuate your name

more than Alexander the Great's. I &s;hall be glad to know what place you fix on, and when I &s;hall wait on you, and whether the <HI>candle&s;ticks are come.</HI> May Heaven load you with all kind of ble&s;&s;ings for time and an un&s;een world.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>At times I have heard good di&s;cour&s;es from Mr. Whitfield, delivered with energy, feeling, and pathos, but then he had been really and truly an actor on the &s;tage in the early part of his life; and as he liked tragedy, and found that a pair of &s;quint|ing eyes (as may be &s;een by his print) did not move the young ladies' tender hearts, but pro|duced laughter in&s;tead of tears, he d&mdash;d the &s;tage, and ever after &s;tuck to that text; but he often melted and &s;queezed to &s;ome purpo&s;e many a rich dowager, who felt the power of his feelings from their mutual &s;ympathy. The low &s;tuff of the preachers in general is not worth repeating; but to &s;hew I have not often attended without &s;ometimes being a good boy, I will begin with the &s;econd be&s;t performer in that line I ever &s;aw, and give his harangue verbatim; and tho' but frothy &s;tuff, it is much better, and more like rea|&s;on than the damnation &s;o terribly thundered out,
<PB N="9" REF="9">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oo often in &s;tage invective; &s;o much &s;o, that were they not hardened by the familiarity of their fire, brim&s;tone, and pitchforks, if it thundered I &s;hould fear le&s;s if in a playhou&s;e than in the tabernacle, particularly if near the preacher.</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley about four years ago, in the fields at Leeds, for want of room for his congregation in his tabernacle, gave an account of him&s;elf by informing us, That when he was at college he was particularly fond of the devil's pops (or cards); and &s;aid, that every Saturday he was one of a con|&s;tant party at Whi&s;t, not only for the afternoon, but al&s;o for the evening; he then mentioned the names of &s;everal re&s;pectable gentlemen who were with him at college.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But," continued he, "the latter part of my time there I became acquainted with the Lord, I u&s;ed to hold communication with him. On my fir&s;t acquaintance," &s;aid We&s;ley, "I u&s;ed to talk with the Lord once a week, then every day, from that to twice a day, till at la&s;t the intimacy &s;o increa&s;ed, that He appointed a meeting once in every four hours."</Q> He recollected, he &s;aid, the la&s;t Saturday he ever played at cards, that the rubber at Whi&s;t was longer than he expected; and on ob&s;erving the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the game, he pulled out his watch, when to his &s;hame he found it was &s;ome minutes pa&s;t eight, which was beyond the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ime he had appointed to meet the Lord:&mdash;He
<PB N="10" REF="10">
thought the devil had certainly tempted him to &s;tay beyond his hour, he therefore &s;uddenly gave his cards to a gentleman near him to fini&s;h the game, and went to the place appointed, be&s;eech|ing forgiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s for his crime, and re&s;olved never to play with the devil's pops again. That re&s;olu|tion he had never broken; and what was more extraordinary, that his brother and &s;i&s;ter, though di&s;tant from Cambridge, experienced &s;igns of grace on that &s;ame day, on that &s;ame hour, in the month of October. After the ea&s;y acquaintance he had made, the idea of which I think too &s;olemn to declare and mention in the familiar manner tho&s;e &s;elf-elected people do. What mu&s;t have become of all the tribes before us for the la&s;t &s;e|venteen hundred years but damnation? How un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">tunate that Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hodi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m did not &s;tart up through a trap-door many centuries ago! What a hypo|critical led-by-the-no&s;e world it would then have been!</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley, after expatiating on the devil's pops, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now, my dear friends! if you think there is no harm follows from playing at cards, why play at cards:&mdash;If you think, my dear bre|thren, there is no harm in hunting a poor little hare and depriving it of life, why you may go a|hunting without being guilty of &s;in:&mdash;I do not &s;ay you will be d&mdash;d for that, provided in your
<PB N="11" REF="11">
con&s;cience you do not think you are doing wrong.&mdash;If you think there is no harm in playing with the devil's books, or going to an a&s;&s;embly, where you &s;hall &s;tay till two or three o'clock in the morn|ing, and where they dance belly to belly and back to back, and put them&s;elves in the mo&s;t un&s;eemly po&s;tures&mdash;why, if you think there is no harm in going to that a&s;&s;embly, you may go. I am told," continued We&s;ley, "you have a wicked playhou&s;e in Leeds&mdash;I do not &s;ay you will be d&mdash;d for going to &s;ee a play, if you think there is no harm in &s;eeing a play. But now, my dear brethren, let me call you to a recollection of the&s;e trifling mat|ters: Though you have heard me repeat that I do not pronounce damnation on my hearers for play|ing with the devil's pops, or for killing a harmle&s;s hare and depriving it of life&mdash;though I have not &s;aid the devil is with &s;preading arms expecting to receive you, but that you may go to an a&s;&s;embly, or even to the devil's hou&s;e, without damnation; yet, my dear brethren, if in&s;tead of the devil's pops, the going a-hunting, or to the dancing a&s;|&s;embly, or to &s;ee a play, you can, like me, get ac|quainted and enter into conver&s;ation and inti|macy with the Lord, who will talk, who will hold conver&s;e with you here on earth&mdash;how can you prefer &s;uch vanities of this fooli&s;h world to
<PB N="12" REF="12">
real bli&s;s in this and the world to come?"</Q>&mdash;Here ends Mr. We&s;ley.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Whitfied (the fir&s;t actor in the Methodi&s;t walk) was of a contrary ca&s;t entirely, and not without humour here and there. His dialect was very particular&mdash;<HI>Lurd</HI> in&s;tead of Lord, <HI>Gud</HI> in&s;tead of God&mdash;as, <HI>O Lurd Gud!</HI></P>
<P>I remember a text of his was&mdash;<HI>May we all work the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arder.</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"There was a poor woman, and &s;he was a long time before &s;he was converted: &s;he was three-&s;core years and ten&mdash;yes &s;he was;&mdash;&s;he was three-&s;core years and ten:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir, (&s;ays &s;he to the good man that converted her) Sir, (&s;ays &s;he) I am three-&s;core years and ten, I have been a long time about it: but Sir, (&s;ays &s;he) I will work the harder;&mdash;yes, Sir, (&s;ays &s;he) I will work the harder!"</Q> And O! may you all like that dear good woman work the harder."</Q> Then followed a groan of applau&s;e; for he had, like Mr. Bayes, a &s;elected number in his pit that under&s;tood their cues, and were &s;ure to applaud, and the re&s;t of the hou&s;e followed of cour&s;e. Then Whitfield, looking round the rails of his little de&s;k below&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What, you young ones! why you are &s;ome of you twelve, &s;ome fourteen, and &s;ome &s;ixteen years of age, yet you do not think of going to hell? What!" exclaim|ed Whitfield, "twelve and fourteen years of age, and not thinking of going to hell! O ye little
<PB N="13" REF="13">
brats you!"</Q>&mdash;and at that in&s;tant the old women groaned, and, like fell Charybdis, murmured hoar&s;e applau&s;e; and Whitfield &s;hook his head, and growled in his white wig, exactly like my perform|ance of Squintum, as I actually practi&s;ed it from the &s;erious comical di&s;cour&s;e I am now relating. Whitfield then proceeded thus&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You go to plays! and what do you &s;ee there? Why, if you will not tell me, I will tell you what you &s;ee there!&mdash;When you &s;ee the players on the &s;tage, you &s;ee the devil's children grinning at you; and when you go to the playhou&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e you go in ruffles&mdash;I won|der whether St. Paul wore ruffles? No; there were no ruffles in tho&s;e days. I am told," conti|nued he archly, "that people &s;ay I bawl&mdash;well I allow it, I do bawl, and I will bawl&mdash;I will not be a velvet-mouthed preacher, I will not &s;peak the word of <HI>Gud</HI> in a &s;leepy manner; like your church preachers&mdash;I'll tell you a &s;tory.<P>"The Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury in the year 1675, was acquainted with Mr. Betterton the player. One day the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury &s;aid to Betterton the player, "Pray inform me Mr. Betterton, what is the rea&s;on you actors on the &s;tage can affect your congregations with &s;peak|ing of things imaginary, as if they were real, while we in the church &s;peak of things real, which our congregations only receive as if they were ima|ginary?"
<PB N="14" REF="14">
"Why, my Lord, (&s;ays Betterton the player) the rea&s;on is very plain&mdash;we actors on the &s;tage, &s;peak of things imaginary, as if they were real, and you in the pulpit &s;peak of things real, as if they were imaginary." Therefore," added Whitfield, "I will bawl, I will not be a velvet|mouthed preacher."</P></Q></P>
<P>I leave the reader to judge on the good rea&s;on|ing of Methodi&s;m. I cannot help noticing for the honour of the &s;tage, that Mr. Whitfield could not have betrayed him&s;elf into a better &s;tory for its credit&mdash;his pointing out an intimacy between the Lord Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and Mr. Bet|terton): And for the actor, he could not have gi|ven a more &s;ub&s;tantial and revered authority. And what a joke for Mr. Whitfield to pronounce damnation on players, when he certainly avowed in his own opinion, that Mr. Betterton was, what all the world ever acknowledged him to be, a &s;cholar and gentleman of honour; and Mr. Whitfield gave the players rea&s;oning and exempli|fication, for his own mode of preaching. But hypocri&s;y, like the cloven foot, will &s;ometimes be e&s;pied.</P>
<P>Some of the wild preachers of this kind, often remind me of Antonio in the Merchant of Venice&mdash;<Q><PB N="15" REF="15">

<P>As a &s;triking in&s;tance of good-will, charity, and mildne&s;s, being prevalent in the minds of Me|thodi&s;ts, I in&s;ert the following paragraph from Mr. Bowling's Leeds paper&mdash; <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"At York A&s;&s;izes, William Richards, for rob|bing the Theatre-Royal, was ordered to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> tran&s;ported for &s;even years; and on the We&s;tern Circuit, a man was convicted of robbing a Methodi&s;t Chapel, and &s;entenced to one year's impri&s;onment. Thus, in the eye of the law, a <HI>Hou&s;e of Prayer</HI> is ju&s;t one &s;eventh the value of a <HI>Den of Thieves.</HI>" <BIBL>LEEDS MERCURY, 1790.</BIBL></P></Q></P>
<P>But now for my tabernacle at Covent-Garden, where my&s;elf and Mr. Rich were lately ca&s;ting the
<PB N="16" REF="16">
comedy of the Minor, and which was the occa&s;ion of my preaching. Mr. Rich and I were on &s;uch &s;udden terms of violent friend&s;hip, that he in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould ca&s;t the parts. I put down the Minor, Mr. Dyer;&mdash;Richard Wealthy, Mr. Sparks, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The morning after, a note came from Mr. Sparks for Mr. Rich, to the following purport: <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Sparks's compliments to Mr. Rich, he is concerned at being obliged to return the part of Richard Wealthy; but as he is given to under|&s;tand Mr. Wilkin&s;on is engaged, and is to &s;u&s;tain the principal characters in the comedy, Mr. Sparks cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;ent by any means to perform or a&s;&s;i&s;t in any piece, for the advantage of a villain, who unprovoked has endeavoured to hurt him in his peace of mind, and injure his reputation, as an actor, with the public."</Q>&mdash;When Mr. Rich gave me the note to read, it perplexed me much; but I immediately adverted to my very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation when at Drury-Lane, and that I had given up every idea of offending the actors of Covent-Garden: that by the artifice of Mr. Garrick and Mr. Foote I was forced on the &s;tage at Drury-Lane, in 1758, again&s;t my own con&s;ent: and reque&s;ted Mr. Rich further to ob|&s;erve, that when my own benefits happened at Drury-Lane, in 1758 and 1759, not any actor whatever had been offended by any imitations or
<PB N="17" REF="17">
mimicry from me; that my &s;ole aim was levelled at Mr. Foote, for the ill-treatment I had received from him: and as a &s;tronger proof, I referred to my conduct in Dublin the winter before, where I had not created a &s;ingle enemy by &s;uch behavi|our; nor at my benefit the &s;pring before at Drury-Lane, or offered any entertainment of the kind, either from the de&s;ire of my friends, the public, or even to a&s;&s;i&s;t my own emolument on my late benefits in London, which it certainly mu&s;t be acknowledged it would have done, and much to my advantage; but I readily le&s;&s;ened my own pro|fits rather than incur enmity: I had in con&s;e|quence of that con&s;ideration hoped, that I had cleared my&s;elf from all intentional injury to Mr. Sparks or other gentlemen. This fully proved to my own mind, for once in my life, the good policy of having laid by imitative talents, (Mr. Foote excepted) all that time: for had I kept publicly practi&s;ing tho&s;e &s;hining qualities, as I judged them, and though I was then certainly in great e&s;tima|tion (while under the trammels of Mr. Foote and Mr. Garrick); yet had I at the latter part of my time with him made too free with my bre|thren of the theatres, very likely I &s;hould not have &s;tood any chance of ri&s;ing again in London ha&s;tily, or have been ever received at Covent-Garden theatre. Indeed I might have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on Mr.
<PB N="18" REF="18">
Garrick's flaps of the &s;houlders of mutton, but, like poor J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rry Sneak, not have got a bit of the brown. My rea&s;ons to Mr. Rich worked as palliatives in my behalf, and had much weight with him. He &s;ent for Sparks, and in his man|ner related to him what <HI>Mr. William&s;kin</HI> had &s;aid: Sparks in a &s;hort time was cool and pacified, and &s;aid, On the whole it appeared perfectly clear that the young man was not &s;o much to blame as he had &s;uppo&s;ed: that it was apparent Wilkin&s;on had not received any reward or gratuity for what he had done, from either of his ma&s;ters Foote or Garrick; but on the contrary they had been guilty of meanne&s;s and ingratitude: And Sparks concluded with not only his declared acceptance of the part, but offered every a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the re|hear&s;als to aid and bring the Minor forward: for its being levelled as a &s;troke at Foote, tickled Sparks, as gratifying his ancient grudge. Though Mr. Foote's acquaintance was univer&s;al, yet as all knew he &s;pared neither friend nor foe, there could not be the lea&s;t rea&s;on to apprehend a &s;hadow of re|&s;entment from the audience by any attack of mi|micry played on Mr. Foote him&s;elf from any op|ponent, as Mr. Foote attacked every body, and, like Drawcan&s;ir, might have &s;aid to his friends&mdash;

A mo&s;t intimate friend of Mr. Foote's wrote to me the following lines, on my being di&s;plea&s;ed, and is a &s;trong likene&s;s.&mdash; <Q REND="inline"><P>"Mr. Wilkin&s;on you &s;hould have known him better long before this time of day; then you would have looked upon him as a peculiar man, with &s;uch gifts of originality relative to men, man|ners, and places&mdash;whether he is in general right or wrong, I will not pretend to &s;ay; but I will give you this as my own opinion, that if he is wrong, it is difficult to di&s;pute with him; and when he is right, it is impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer him."</P></Q></P>
<P>Peace being &s;ettled, and my&s;elf one of the Co|vent-Garden company, Foote &s;oon got intelligence from &s;pies in our royal camp, of what was going forward: he was much enraged, and not having forgiven my freedoms with him at Dublin the winter before, he thought I pur&s;ued him like his evil &s;pirit. And one morning when I was &s;itting at the grand levee at Mr. Rich's, with my new friend Sparks in council of war, we were alarmed with a thundering rat-tat and ringing of the bell al&s;o, when a &s;ervant announced Mr. Foote was come to wait on Mr. Rich; and in&s;tead of being u&s;hered into the grand &s;aloon, he had been &s;hewn into the parlour.</P>
<P>Mr. Rich went down to Mr. <HI>Foot&s;eye,</HI> as he called him, but the vi&s;it was not accompanied by
<PB N="20" REF="20">
a calm, for it was mo&s;t violent, blu&s;tering, and boi&s;terous. Mr. Foote furiou&s;ly exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Damn it, you old hound! if you dare let Wil|kin&s;on, that pug no&s;ed &s;on of a b&mdash;h, take any liberty with me as to mimicry, I will bring you your&s;elf, Rich, on the &s;tage! If you want to en|gage that pug, black his face, and let him hand the tea-kettle in a pantomime; for damn the fel|low he is as ignorant as a whore's maid!

<P>We, from various ob&s;tacles, could not get it de|cently on the &s;tage in le&s;s than a fortnight, as other pieces were preparing, &s;uch as Mr. Macklin's new comedy of the Married Libertine; his Love-a-la-Mode; and Mr. Beard and Mi&s;s Brent, were rehear&s;ing Dr. Arne's new opera of Thomas and Sally; which all con&s;idered, made it &s;eem dif|ficult

to get our Minor produced. And on the end of the week that this matter had been &s;ettled, it was adverti&s;ed on the Thur&s;day from Drury-Lane, and on the Saturday was pa&s;ted on every wall&mdash;The MINOR; and that favourite little comedy had been all the week puffed and paragraphed in every new&s;paper by Mr. Foote. But unfore&s;een events &s;ometimes do and undo what our utmo&s;t wi&s;dom and wi&s;hes cannot, as here was an extraordinary in&s;tance; for the bills were but a few hours ex|hibited to public view, when it &s;o happened they were as ha&s;tily plucked down as they had been vigilantly put up; it was on Saturday the 25th of October, 1760, when the &s;udden death of our truly beloved and lamented monarch King George II. occa&s;ioned, for three weeks, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of theatrical ho&s;tilities and diver&s;ions of all kinds in the great city of London.

<P>It &s;o happened and came to pa&s;s, during that &s;erious vacation, that the Minor was brought to maturity at Covent-Garden theatre; and what is more extraordinary, by the indefatigable attention and eagerne&s;s of Mr. Sparks&mdash;<Q><L>Once my mortal foe.</L></Q></P>
<P>When Drury-Lane again opened, the fir&s;t Sa|turday they publi&s;hed the Minor, with Mr. Foote, &amp;c. I po&s;ted my&s;elf in the gallery. Mr. Foote was received, as u&s;ual, with great eclat, by a mo&s;t brilliant and crowded audience; that comedy being in as much vogue then, or more &s;o, than any fa|vourite piece at the pre&s;ent day of 1790, (the run and rage of the School for Scandal, and Duenna, being now over.)&mdash;When the comedy was fini&s;hed I ha&s;tened to Covent-Garden, and urged Mr. Rich to produce the Minor as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; when Mr. Dyer (who was to act the part of Sir George, and who was the particular intimate of
<PB N="25" REF="25">
Sparks) judged it a political &s;troke to give out that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iece for the Monday following; and though the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lay before intended had been given out, we pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed on Mr. Rich, and the Minor was announ|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, as by particular de&s;ire, for the Monday: Mr. Foote's characters of Shift, Smirk, Mrs. Cole, and the Epilogue, by Mr. Wilkin&s;on. It was not only honoured with an overflowing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">heatre, but had a very great reception, and it had a con&s;iderable run; and in that puff I had the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dvantage, for Mr. Rich's new matters were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eady for repre&s;entation, therefore I was the more wanted.&mdash;Mr. Foote &s;hared the profits of his night's performance; for that rea&s;on, therefore, if Garrick had any thing &s;trong to adverti&s;e, or wi&s;hed to play him&s;elf, Mr. Foote was obliged to give way. On the &s;econd night of my perform|ance, Mr. Rich at the end of the Minor brought an article for me to &s;ign, accompanied by Mr. Wood, his &s;on-in-law, an attorney; the pur|port was, one hundred guineas for playing till the fir&s;t of January, and a benefit when I cho&s;e to ap|point it. It was a very genteel offer, as my be|nefit con&s;idered, made it of real con&s;equence to me, and of cour&s;e the propo&s;al was by me accepted, &s;igned, and &s;ealed. On the fir&s;t night, in the per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ormance of Shift, I broke loo&s;e into my imitative
<PB N="26" REF="26">
qualities, which I had not practi&s;ed (as to actors) in London for two years.</P>
<P>Mo&s;&s;op had but the year before gone to Ireland; he was very peculiar, very popular, and well recollected: I was very like him indeed, and was obliged to repeat his &s;peeches of Zaphimri in the Orphan of China.</P>
<P>To prove what odd mortals we are as to our love and our hate, Sparks, who I related as formerly to have been my profe&s;&s;ed enemy, was now turned to the other extreme, and was my hearty well-wi&s;her. On my leaving the &s;tage as Shift, he took me fa&s;t by the hand and wi&s;hed me joy, and bur&s;t out into a violent fit of laughing:&mdash;Says I, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Sparks, what are you laughing at?" "Why," replied he, "I am laughing at my&s;elf, Sir: for two years ago I was bloody angry at you for the carrying me into company where I was not; yet your imitation of Mo&s;&s;op was &s;o &s;trong, that I was irre&s;i&s;tibly plea|&s;ed whether I would or no: &s;o I am laughing at my own ab&s;urdity."</Q> Tho&s;e imitations having been bottled up by me &s;o long had then double the effect, and made Shift a &s;tar in the Minor.&mdash;My introduction in the character of Foote was truly Foote from top to toe; and as to Mr. Gar|rick I made no &s;cruple, though I had him before me, as his curio&s;ity had led him to &s;ee me, not expecting that I would take him, off, or he would
<PB N="27" REF="27">
not have been &s;o publicly &s;urrounded, but have carefully avoided &s;uch a queer &s;ituation. My imitations were never told either in bill or new&s;|paper who they were de&s;igned for; but when|ever I was particularly lucky, the audience would repeat the name, as Sparks! Sparks! Barry! Barry! Nor was I a little plea&s;ed when repeating from Macbeth, <Q REND="inline">"Who can be wi&s;e, amazed, &amp;c."</Q> I heard the audience echo from one to the other, <Q REND="inline">"O Garrick! Garrick!"</Q>&mdash;O thought I, my ma|&s;ter, this is my day of triumph!&mdash;and from that night he never forgave or forgot his being &s;o &s;ur|rounded in the front box, nor did he ever &s;peak to me again to the day of his death.</P>
<P>My Whitfield was beyond compare; his man|ner was then univer&s;ally known.&mdash;Mr. Foote was &s;truck by &s;tepping in by chance, and once hearing Whitfield; the mixture of who&s;e ab|&s;urdity, whim, con&s;equence, and extravagance, plea&s;ed his fancy and entertained him highly, as Whitfield that day was dealing out damnation, fire, and brim&s;tone as cheerfully as if they were &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings. What pity it is that our fears only, and not our rea&s;on, will bring conviction; but rea&s;on, handed by unaffected pure piety and religion, would be a day of woe to Methodi&s;m, and le&s;&s;en their audiences in many tabernacles, where they are certain to lament preaching to no|body,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
though at the &s;ame time wedged to the outer doors, and on the Sunday exclaiming at the full crowded theatres, which have probably been almo&s;t de&s;erted. But Mr. Foote was only a &s;py at Whitfield's academy, while I had been a zea|lot for &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons before my encounter at Co|vent Garden with Mr. Foote. My attendance had been con&s;tant with my friend Shuter, and as he actually was one of the new-born, and paid large &s;ums to Whitfield, I was always permitted to &s;tay with him, for he really was bewildered in his brain, more by wi&s;hing to acquire imaginary grace than by all his drinking: and whenever he was warm with the bottle, and with only a friend or two, like Maw-worm he could not mind his &s;hop becau&s;e he thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ht it a &s;in, and wis;hed to go a preaching; for Shuter, like Maw-worm, believed he had had a call. I have gone with Shuter at &s;ix in the morning of a Sunday to Tottenham-Court-Road, then before ten to Mr. We&s;ley's in Long-Acre, at eleven again to Tottenham-Court-Road tabernacle, dined near Bedlam in Moorfields (a very proper place for us both) with a party of the Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y Ones, went at three to Mr. We&s;ley's theatre there, (the tabernacle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> mean) from that to Whit|fie d's in Moorfields till eight, and then &s;hut up to commune with the family-compact. Now with all this practice and attention, and with my
<PB N="29" REF="29">
natural talents, I mu&s;t have been a blockhead in|deed not to have gleaned &s;ome good things; (and doubtle&s;s Mr. Whitfield was at times a good preacher, and truly excellent.) I therefore re|ally exhibited and obtained a much &s;tronger like|ne&s;s as Dr. Squintum than Mr. Foote did. The week before my Covent-Garden exhibition I met my friend Shuter at the tabernacle; a great cool|ne&s;s had continued for &s;ome time, as we had not &s;poke to, or even looked at each other &s;ince the breach between us in the year 1758; but as we were met together in a place of charity and for|givene&s;s to all who &s;ub&s;cribed to the dictator, we became very &s;ociable, and before the conclu&s;ion of Whitfield's lecture were perfectly recon|ciled: We adjourned to the Ro&s;e, and by three the next morning were &s;worn friends, and conti|nued &s;o till death called him away.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ndeed he was above eleven years older than me, and would have been &s;ixty-three had he lived to this time. Ned Shuter was a lively, &s;pirited, &s;hrewd compa|nion; &s;uperior natural whim and humour &s;urely never inhabited a human brea&s;t, for what he &s;aid and did was all his own, as it was with difficulty he could read the parts he had to play, and could not write at all; he had attained to SIGN an or|der, but no more: Nature could not have be|&s;towed her gifts to greater advantage than on

poor Ned, as what &s;he gave he made &s;hine, not only con&s;picuou&s;ly but brilliantly, and that to the delight of all who knew him on or off the &s;tage&mdash;he might be truly dubbed <Q REND="inline">"The Child of Na|ture:"</Q>&mdash;He was no man's enemy but his own.

<P>My popularity that year of the Minor was &s;uch, that my acquaintance I might truly term univer|&s;al. My benefit was the week before Chri&s;tmas, and was not only crowded, but honourably at|tended, which put my finances into a mo&s;t re&s;pect|able accumulation, though my free living from place to place was very expen&s;ive, and indeed ex|travagant:&mdash;Yet the reader is to ob&s;erve my be|nefits in general were all free from any charges, and were what we on the &s;tage term <HI>clear benefits;</HI> and my night being numerou&s;ly attended in the middle of a winter &s;ea&s;on in &s;uch a metropolis as London cannot be judged a phaeno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">enon.</P>

time to the pre&s;ent that they proceeded from the &s;ecret good wi&s;hes and knowledge of Mr. Murphy, who was often on parties at Mr. Foote's, and knew what I meant when the public did not:&mdash;Whether it was to him I was obliged or no he be&s;t can tell; if he did, it may have e&s;caped his me|mory, and he may not recollect &s;o trivial a cir|cum&s;tance, as it did not relate to him&s;elf. Why I take the wi&s;dom to my&s;elf of thinking the let|ters came from Mr. Murphy (who had behaved very kindly to me) is, that in 1759, on my bene|fit night at Drury-Lane, as I was acting the cha|racter of Mr. Foote, he (Mr. Murphy) was &s;it|ting in the orche&s;tra; and as I grew elated with applau&s;e, and feeling to my&s;elf that all I did was right, I too often made u&s;e of a particular word, which Mr. Foote thoughtle&s;sly, and from cu&s;tom, often repeated laughingly in his own room in com|mon conver&s;ation; it was a word fooli&s;h and in|delicate, and by no means fit to be pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ly or ignorantly mentioned in a public theatre; and I had never thought as to the meaning, but was, I declare, mo&s;t perfectly innocent of it; and from my rapid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of &s;peech the audience (luckily indeed for me) did not attend to it any more than my&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lf:&mdash;And as Mr. Sher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dan's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> the Critic &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"The players never know when to have done with a good thing,"</Q> &s;o did I often repeat

this unfit word before a mo&s;t re&s;pectable audience. I &s;aw Mr. Murphy in the orche&s;tra enjoying my performance and applauding, which gave me double vigour; when on a &s;udden he &s;tarted up, and I lo&s;t, from the &s;ituation full before me, him whom I had &s;een in &s;uch high humour, therefore I feared &s;omething was very wrong, but what I could not divine;&mdash;but I do &s;uppo&s;e, what <HI>I &s;aid</HI> &s;o repeatedly had frightened him from his plea|&s;ant &s;eat:&mdash;Luckily for me the loud laughter and applau&s;e drowned the &s;en&s;es, or I might have &s;een more decampments, or my&s;elf have been ordered &s;o to do: and I am certain, had I been at that time di&s;graced I &s;hould not have known for why. But all went off to my exce&s;s of joy; and when I &s;aw Mr. Murphy &s;ome days after, he kindly ex|plained what had drove him from his place, as he declared he trembled for me, and gave me at the &s;ame time proper information &s;ufficient to rectify my error and improve my breeding, without need of John&s;on's Dictionary for further knowledge. This is a le&s;&s;on for all imitations to be confined entirely to the modes and manners only with which the audience are acquainted; for the pri|vate manners in life of Mr. Garrick, or Mr. Any|body, they are neither familiarized to, nor in the lea&s;t acquainted with, therefore fooli&s;h to add, by way of garni&s;h; as what might plea&s;e in a private

<P>My friendly reader, I fear, will be apt to &s;hrink, and think I have been too liberal in prai&s;ing and loading my&s;elf with encomiums re|lative to my applau&s;e and reputation in London in 1760, as a rival in point of mimicry, in the pub|lic e&s;timation, when oppo&s;ed to Mr. Foote; but I really aver and believe I have not exceeded the &s;trict bounds of truth.

<P>Early in March I was favoured with a letter from my good friend Mrs. Strode at Port&s;mouth, informing me, that a world of people were ex|pected there, as a grand expedition was preparing again&s;t the French, and the number of officers and &s;ubalterns both of army and navy would be incredible ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ter: that there were no plays going forward, nor any diver&s;ions whatever; and if I could but hit on any entertainment, it would turn out lucrative to me, and be received as a compliment to the town, and all my friends and acquaintance. I made proper inquiries on re|ceiving this plea&s;ing intelligence, and heard every thing Mrs. Strode had mentioned in a manner &s;o

friendly &s;oon confirmed. Now the love of mo|ney, added to the allurement of wandering, &s;eemed to me irre&s;i&s;tible; I knew nothing could be done there in Pa&s;&s;ion-Week, though I might prepare for the en&s;uing holidays, but did not conceive how to manage and contrive without an able a&s;|&s;i&s;tant. Mrs. Strode, at my reque&s;t, procured the theatre again&s;t my arrival; but one auxiliary at lea&s;t became indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;I men|tioned the matter to my laughing whim&s;ical friend Jo&s;eph Au&s;tin, who liked a frolic as well as my|&s;elf; I therefore did not he&s;itate a moment as to whom I &s;hould impart my perplexity: To him I related my new-fangled &s;cheme and want of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, al&s;o laid before him the glaring temptations of army-officers, &amp;c. and propo&s;ed terms of agree|ment.

<P>My friend Jo&s;eph and I had a mo&s;t whim&s;ical en|tertaining week; I am &s;ure he never can forget it, as it con&s;i&s;ted of oddity and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y freaki&s;h occurren|ces. From ten till two at noon we were bu&s;ily employed with plai&s;tering paper on laths for our wings, and filling up the back part of the &s;tage with &s;omething like what we term a flat &s;cene; indeed we had a carpenter, but Jo&s;eph and Tate were the principal workmen. Before the week was expired our playhou&s;e was prepared for the receiving a mo&s;t &s;plendid audience, with which we were honoured; even our &s;tage was crowded and produced the be&s;t back flat &s;cene I ever &s;aw,

which well paid us for our indu&s;try. We were not only gratified with the great hou&s;e being lu|crative and fa&s;hionable, but we were &s;till more flat|tered and plea&s;ed by a de&s;ire of a &s;econd night, and with the a&s;&s;urance of good &s;upport; for my own part I had been &s;o fettered and confined while articled by Mr. Garrick, that I was rejoiced at being what I liked to be, and ever will be if I can, FREE <HI>as air;</HI> that by choice &s;hall ever be my motto; therefore the &s;econd night was palat|able and quite agreeable to me. But here a diffi|culty aro&s;e: I had engaged to perform for my friend Shuter's benefit on Thur&s;day, March 26, and that promi&s;e, without breach of word, ho|nour, or friend&s;hip, was ea&s;y and practicable, as time would ju&s;t allow it, and not any to &s;pare; but my trepanned friend Jo&s;eph, on this &s;muggled expedition, was likely to be tried for offences at the grand court of Drury by Judge Garrick, a &s;evere judge, who would demand his bond, as Jo&s;eph had actually engaged to play the Wedne&s;|day night, March 25, a new part wrote by Mrs. Clive for her own benefit; who at writing was (as may with ju&s;tice be equally &s;aid of my&s;elf) <HI>a dead good one.</HI> However he was very happy, and temptation lay before him:&mdash;So fell Adam&mdash;So fell Jo&s;eph, though he has not the lea&s;t relation|&s;hip

to Jo&s;eph the Ba&s;hful:&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding his perilous &s;ituation he yielded to entreaty, though he fore&s;aw and dreaded the inevitable &s;torm. We performed much the &s;ame kind of jumbled incohe|rent entertainment as we had done on the fir&s;t night. We had a full hou&s;e on the Tue&s;day, and &s;oon after &s;upper that night my friend Jo&s;eph Au&s;tin &s;et off with his lady for London, and left me be|hind to &s;ettle all bills, &amp;c. for our private and public expenditure. My friend got to London in a whole &s;kin, but too late for his part; and in|deed he had been &s;o laden the week before with &s;tate affairs upon his head and &s;houlders, that had he been there a day &s;ooner I do not &s;uppo&s;e he had &s;tudied &s;ufficiently to have known a &s;entence.&mdash;The lamentable con&s;equence to Mrs. Bayes (or rather Dame Clive) was her being obliged to &s;ub|mit to change her new farce, or have an apology made for the part to be read&mdash;which I under&s;tood was kindly undertaken by Mr. Packer, but am not certain. However the piece was unfortu|nately d&mdash;d, and the dreadful doom of it &s;he attributed entirely to the neglective and audacious behaviour of that impudent Au&s;tin; it enraged that truly comical lady (on the &s;tage only) to the highe&s;t pitch of fury; not Ceres with her torch &s;et the fields of corn on fire with more eager fan|ta&s;tic fury than &s;he would have at that in&s;tant

Madam Clive at noon came to the theatre and furiou&s;ly rung the alarm bell: for her name being omitted was an offence &s;he con&s;trued &s;o heinous, that nothing but vengeance, and blood! blood!
<PB N="42" REF="42">
Iago was the word! and it was no more &s;trange than true that Garrick ever feared to meet that female &s;pirit. Perhaps Mr. Cro&s;s the prompter might think Garrick's name was all-&s;ufficient; but her not &s;eeing in the bill <Q REND="inline">"The Fine Lady by Mrs. Clive,"</Q> was &s;o unpardonable an offence, that could &s;he have got near him, and he had been &s;evere in his replies, I dare &s;ay &s;he would have deranged King David's wig and dre&s;s as adorned for Lord Chalk&s;tone, which would have di&s;concerted him much.

war was not to be defended; and what added to his crime in Mr. Garrick's eye was, that he had been with that infernal exotic, Wilkin&s;on, to whom he never granted ab&s;olution.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mr. Garrick's oddities, I al|ways did and &s;hall reverence, re&s;pect, and e&s;teem him as the greate&s;t actor the Briti&s;h &s;tage has ever known, from its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment to the pre&s;ent day: but in other points I have only given the picture as it &s;hould be, from the life, with all its &s;pots, blemi&s;hes, and beauties; &s;o my con&s;cience may re&s;t: as certainly, if my narrative re&s;pecting his treatment of my&s;elf be true, there remains no call of any trait of Mr. Garrick from my pen but ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>Mr. Garrick, though attached to &s;ubordination, was kept in order and decorum him&s;elf by our pre&s;ent ingenious writer, Coun&s;ellor Murphy; that gentleman could teaze his &s;oul, and gall his gizzard whenever he plea&s;ed or judged him&s;elf wronged. Mr. Macklin my ma&s;ter Garrick did not much love, though formerly they were on a friendly footing, but the Drury palace gates again&s;t his irony were fa&s;t clo&s;ed. When Barbaro&s;&s;a (wrote by the late Dr. Brown) was produced, Garrick the fir&s;t night entered after the fourth act in a glittering &s;ilver-&s;pangled ti&s;&s;ue &s;hape; when Mrs. Clive, in&s;tead of court adulation, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"O my God! room! room! make room for the royal lamp-lighter!"</Q>&mdash;which rudene&s;s di&s;concert|ed him much for the remaining part of the even|ing; and certainly it was too free, and not well timed, as he was tremblingly alive all over on the fir&s;t night of a new part in a new play; and it

<P>Before I arrived in town from Port&s;mouth for Shuter's benefit, Mr. Arthur (manager of the Bath company) came to that town on the plan of building a new theatre there, as the inhabitants much wi&s;hed for a better and more regular com|pany of performers. Mr. Arthur waited on me, wi&s;hed me joy on the &s;ucce&s;s of my two nights public <HI>impromptu</HI> at Port&s;mouth; and as his friends, who had encouraged his new undertaking, wi&s;hed to &s;ee me there again the en&s;uing &s;ummer, he hoped it would turn out mutually agreeable and lucrative to him&s;elf and me;&mdash;the matter was &s;ettled and agreed between us. He then made another propo&s;al for my playing ten nights that &s;pring &s;ea&s;on at Bath, with a clear benefit&mdash;that was al&s;o agreed on, and I left Port&s;mouth and got to London on Wedne&s;day night, March 25, 1760, and on Thur&s;day gave Tea, as I had pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ed, for my friend Shuter's benefit; and I may with great truth affirm with wonderful applau&s;e: The approbation intoxicated me &s;o much, that the night following, being in company with Shu|ter and Ballard the trea&s;urer, I con&s;ented to pour water on the leaves for his benefit early in May, though I had engaged for Bath, and knew I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o incur the expence from thence to London and

back again; but my de&s;ire for applau&s;e increa&s;ed my thir&s;t: it went down &s;o deliciou&s;ly, that I was glad to cover that as an obligation, which in fact I was plea&s;ed to be reque&s;ted to do, and thought no price I could pay equal to public ap|probation. I did not then &s;o well know the fickle changes of Fortune as well as life&mdash;Would I were young again!&mdash;But let it go&mdash;A fooli&s;h figure! farewell it.</P>
<P>I arrived at Bath well, and without the lea&s;t fa|tigue; the next day I paid my re&s;pects to Mr. Arthur, al&s;o to Mr. Ridout, with a thou&s;and compliments from Mr. Rich, who was unhappy at his ill-declining health calling him there, and obliging him to quit Covent-Garden theatre; to which place he never more returned. He was the only man in whom Mr. Rich placed any con|fidence, or who&s;e advice he would li&s;ten to. Mr. Ridout being prime mini&s;ter, he was of cour&s;e be|&s;pattered with plenty of abu&s;e; but he, like me and Benedick, cared not for a &s;atire or an epi|gram:&mdash;for if a man will let him&s;elf be beaten with brains, he &s;hall wear nothing hand&s;ome about him.</P>
<P>Ridout was extremely glad to &s;ee me at Bath, and when my benefit was adverti&s;ed he &s;ent me a letter de&s;iring three box tickets, and begged my acceptance of the inclo&s;ed three guineas, with his

Bath was at that time, and &s;till continues, a place of con|&s;tant, fa&s;hionable, and friendly re&s;ort of per&s;ons of quality and fortune from the kingdom of Ireland: It was in truth a fortunate circum&s;tance, as they immediately introduced me not only to a genteel but fa&s;hionable re&s;ort of friends, who were of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice in fixing my reputation as a public performer among&s;t all the circle of their acquaint|ance, be&s;ides the certain allowed credit, convenience, and &s;elf-&s;atisfaction on my Bath on&s;et as an actor, to have &s;uch eligible and e&s;teemed places to dine at, and be received as a particular friend and vi&s;itant at Mr. Chaigneau's in Gay-&s;treet, and Mrs. Forbes's in Queen-&s;quare, &amp;c. I played a variety of characters there, and it would be tedious and ful&s;ome to repeat the favours I received; every per&s;on I knew con&s;ulted to make me happy. My benefit was on Monday, April 27, 1761&mdash;Confe|deracy the play, with Tea and the farce of the Guardian&mdash;I acted Mrs. Amlet, and the Guar|dian, with Tea; and in the cour&s;e of my playing I acted Richard, Lear, Hamlet, and Shylock&mdash;parts in the Minor, Cadwallader, Petruchio, &amp;c.

My benefit was honoured with &s;o great a demand for places, that the <HI>whole pit was laid into the boxes,</HI> a circum&s;tance which had not been often in|&s;tanced.

<P>From thence I lounged at Winche&s;ter until the new theatre at Port&s;mouth (building under Mr. Arthur's in&s;pection) was ready for the reception of the Bath Company, at that time under his di|rection, where I re&s;orted according to beat of

drum and marching orders on the 1&s;t of July; but when I &s;aw the de&s;olate &s;tate of the building, I judged it impracticable for its wide extended walls to have a play enacted that good year of our Lord: However Arthur was indefatigable; &s;low, and &s;ure; and in &s;o &s;hort a time as Monday, July 20, <HI>Hamlet</HI> was announced for opening our new theatre, with the farce of the Contrivances&mdash;Hamlet, Mr. Wilkin&s;on; Polonius, Mr. Arthur; Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">atia, Mr. Kea&s;berry; the Queen, Mrs. Lee.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lee was wife to the late Mr. Lee, and mother to the pre&s;ent Mi&s;s Lees of Bath: One wrote the plea&s;ant comedy of the Chapter of Ac|cidents; and the other that entertaining and well-drawn romance of the Rece&s;s. Mr Lee was well known in London as an actor of merit at Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden, al&s;o as manager and performer at Edinburgh and Bath. But &s;ome di&s;pute had happened about a year before I was at Bath between Mr. Lee and Mr. Palmer, (the Bath proprietor) which not being amicably &s;ettled, Mr. Lee withdrew; but &s;he very &s;en&s;ibly (not hav|ing given any cau&s;e for complaint) de&s;ired to be retained.</P>

opinion: But great men will overcome ob&s;tacles, and the wonder-working incomparable Arthur de&s;pi&s;ed difficulties. At twelve o'clock at noon there was not one &s;eat in the pit, but he actually contrived to get it fini&s;hed by &s;even. Not any rehear&s;al was po&s;&s;ible, as the &s;tage was up to one's wai&s;t in &s;havings. The populace were eager to &s;ee the new playhou&s;e, new company, and the fir&s;t acted play; but on traver&s;ing the &s;treets from four till &s;even, and no admittance, they became very noi&s;y, the &s;ailors particularly unruly; when into the &s;treet popped our old cro&s;s commander in chief, Admiral Arthur&mdash;not like his adverti&s;ed character of Polonius, but more re&s;embling one of the witches in Macbeth; for he had on an old round flapped hat, a woman's checked apron, with a large broom in his hand, and his face as begrimed and greasy as a barn-acting Othello in the Dog-days: He harangued the multitude, high and low, and humbly be&s;eeched their patience while him&s;elf and the hard-laboured carpenters a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;weep|ing the &s;havings out of the pit and gallery: He received a good hooting with a laugh, and retired to make his words good by deeds, and Hecate|like he &s;weated and &s;wept mo&s;t violently, till the word without was given, as their impatience was beyond bounds; the doors were bur&s;t open, the witch and her &s;tick were thrown down and rolled

over and over; the broom had no other charms or &s;pells than to a&s;&s;i&s;t the cripple to hobble out and e&s;cape with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; there were no per&s;ons ready, or offices fixed to take the money, &s;o each &s;ailor and his la&s;s, or his companion and others &s;eated them&s;elves in &s;uch places as &s;uited their fancies. But Arthur to &s;hew his humble|ne&s;s acted as a wary and careful manager; for, without putting off his apron, as &s;oon as the hou&s;e had filled and all were a little quiet and &s;eated, in the mid&s;t of a cloud of du&s;t he doffed his old brown hat, and went profoundly round the theatre to collect in it from every part what he could either by threats or civility obtain: &s;ome did pay, others did not, and &s;ome only what they plea&s;ed; nor would he have &s;tirred till twelve at night whil&s;t he beheld the glimp&s;e of another dropping &s;hil|ling to have paid for their forcibly-obtained foot|ing.

Mr. Lee was very fond of teaching to act, with which he amu&s;ed him&s;elf from Saturday to Saturday with almo&s;t as thin a company as Gibbet's in the Beaux Stratagem&mdash;I am &s;ure it did not double it.&mdash;The &s;alaries the reader may be &s;ure were poor, as Win|che&s;ter with the little camp could not afford great expences &s;o as to procure Mr. Lee a living, and the additional charges of my going there with Mrs. Lee; yet Mr. Lee being known as an actor of merit, the officers were plea&s;ed and obliged to him for their Saturday's lounge, and made it a point to do all in their power to &s;upport him.&mdash;Mr. Lee would not lead off the fir&s;t play&mdash;I be|lieve he was really afraid, his &s;pirits being da&s;hed, as who&s;e would not; like Fal&s;taff, who &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"If I be not a&s;hamed of my &s;oldiers, I am a &s;ou&s;ed gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">et."</Q></P>

The fir&s;t play was on Saturday, Augu&s;t 8, 1761.

My engagement with Mr. Arthur, rendered a compliance (with honour or any degree of hone&s;ty) impo&s;&s;ible. My non-attendance much offended Mr. Rich, as he thought (and very ju&s;tly) he had made me a very genteel and comfortable offer; but after I had two or three times attended his mornings levee, we became as good friends as ever. He even conde&s;cended to reque&s;t a favour, which was, that I would make my fir&s;t appear|ance in a farce, which he told me &s;ecretly in con|fidence, was of his own writing; and I have rea&s;on to believe it was, and that it will not be eagerly contradicted or claimed on account of its be|queathed honours to po&s;terity. It was called the Spirit of Contradiction. He &s;aid, if I would but act the part of the Gardener from his <HI>larning,</HI> it would make my fortune, <HI>provided</HI> I would im|plicitly yield to his in&s;tructions. I had by that

<P>The day before the fracas happened, I had re|ceived a letter of pre&s;&s;ing invitation from Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, then manager of Smock-Alley theatre in Dublin. That unexpected treaty could not have been brought about after Mo&s;&s;op's declared aver|&s;ion, had it not been for the willing interference of Coun&s;ellor Barrett. That gentleman had a
<PB N="75" REF="75">
&s;trong partiality for Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, as a friend and an actor; they had been bred I under&s;tood at college together, which la&s;ting intimacy induced Mr. Barrett to be ever ready to contribute to|wards conciliation and acts of kindne&s;s; for the which, I doubt he &s;uffered very con&s;iderably (tho' willingly) by frequently encroaching on his own &s;ub&s;tantial finances to the generou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ting Mo&s;|&s;op with material &s;ums at times when bewildered, and plunged in his fatal airy &s;cheme of being an oppo&s;ing manager, which too frequently occa|&s;ioned various occurrences and di&s;a&s;ters at different periods; for which generous benevolence, I fear the friendly hearted Coun&s;ellor never had a chance or po&s;&s;ibility of being reimbur&s;ed: however he was affluent, and did not want money, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tre&s;&s;ed actor unhappily did. I relate this from conjecture only, never having been on a footing of intimacy with Mr. Barrett to enable me to vouch for its authenticity, though infinitely obliged to him in Ireland, in 176<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, for many civilities which I am ever plea&s;ed to acknowledge; likewi&s;e his being in&s;trumental to the bringing me and Mr. Mo&s;&s;op on terms of amity once more in 1762: but that governour of re&s;tle&s;s players was not by any means ble&s;&s;ed with a tythe of Mr. Barry's plea&s;ing abilities as an actor, or generous qualities as a man or manager. Mr. Barry had certainly
<PB N="76" REF="76">
a mo&s;t enchanting fa&s;cination beyond the ge|neral lot of mankind; as a proof, it was &s;eldom either creditor or <HI>enemy</HI> left Barry in an ill humour, however in other re&s;pects di&s;&s;atisfied or di&s;appointed. Mr. Mo&s;&s;op was overloaded with a quantity of combu&s;tibles, con&s;i&s;ting of pride, in&s;olence, arro|gance and gall. I reviewed the difference as to the re&s;pective managers; but Mo&s;&s;op's offer claimed a priority of preference, as being the fir&s;t, and that offer was liberal. The reader will think it &s;trange that Mo&s;&s;op &s;hould have any engage|ment with me after his declarations; but he judged (I &s;uppo&s;e) it was better policy to keep &s;uch a mi&s;chievous monkey in his own theatre, where he might play his tricks at the expence of the enemy, than &s;uffer pug to be at the oppo&s;ite one, and be let loo&s;e upon him&s;elf. He wrote me word I might depend on every friend&s;hip in his power, to render his theatre agreeable; and in|&s;inuated, that after his generous per&s;entation he tru&s;ted I would not deal &s;o unlike a gentleman when I arrived in Dublin, as to enter or li&s;ten to any terms whatever as to engaging with Barry and Woodward, which I a&s;&s;ented to. On my ar|rival Mr. Mo&s;&s;op and I &s;oon &s;ettled all prelimina|ries, it was early in January and a few days after Chri&s;tmas holidays. My fir&s;t appearance was in the <HI>play</HI> of the Minor, (which two years before
<PB N="77" REF="77">
had been damned as a <HI>farce</HI>): it would have been hazardous; but its being in&s;inuated and adverti&s;ed with a pompous account of the amazing run and &s;ucce&s;s it had met with at all the three theatres in London, not omitting to mention con&s;iderable alterations, which by &s;o doing obtained a verdict in favour of &s;eeing and hearing it acted. And as Mr. Foote has been mentioned to have ob&s;erved the difference of weather, humours, and various accidents that make for and again&s;t to render it impo&s;&s;ible to account for the uncertain changes in theatrical events, &s;o the Minor was acted to a very fine hou&s;e, received with univer&s;al applau&s;e, and continued to be performed twice a-week to good hou&s;es.</P>
<P>My imitation of Mrs. Bellamy (in Shift), with the Introduction, the Puppets, and a Mock Bur|letta Imitation, &amp;c. were of great &s;ervice. The Minor was well &s;upported, as may be perceived by the following ca&s;t.&mdash;I acted Mr. Foote's cha|racters; the Minor, Mr. Jeffer&s;on; Mr. Wealthy, Mr. Sowden; Sir William, Mr. Baddely; Loader, Mr. Ryder:&mdash;Lucy, Mrs. Kelf. In that theatre I met with my agreeable friend, Mrs. Abington, in high e&s;timation; &s;he did not &s;ee her old friend Tate with a new face. She had grown weary of being connected with Barry and Mrs. Dan|cer, as the latter could not reli&s;h the triumph of
<PB N="78" REF="78">
Mi&s;s Notable, nor could Mi&s;s Notable patiently &s;ubmit to the in&s;olence and affected &s;uperiority of Mrs. Conque&s;t. My agreeable acquaintance Mrs. Kelf, now Mrs. Egerton, with her mother and &s;i&s;ter, were at Mo&s;&s;op's theatre; and if this book falls into her hands, &s;he will laugh very heartily on recollecting the many happy days, and whim|&s;ical adventures which occurred that winter in dear Dublin. Whenever I remember the happine&s;s I there experienced, and the numerous obligations I received in that city, I &s;igh and langui&s;h for another peep, ere I depart to meet my many good friends of great Britain and Ireland which have gone before me, to that country <HI>from who&s;e bourne no traveller returns.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op and my&s;elf, for the fir&s;t three weeks, were on the mo&s;t intimate footing. I dined twice with him at Dr. Wil&s;on's apartments in Trinity College; he was a &s;taunch friend of Mo&s;&s;op's. (I believe the Smock-ally theatre was Dr. Wil|&s;on's property.) The&s;e dinners, I &s;urmi&s;ed, were intended to induce me, by their mutual rhetoric and per&s;ua&s;ion, to attack Barry and Woodward; but that I declined from policy. For I propheti|cally judged it mo&s;t likely that this &s;udden apparent friend&s;hip would not be of very long duration, as I knew in his heart he hated me: &s;o the founda|tion which I depended on his good will was very
<PB N="79" REF="79">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ak and frivolous; and when he wanted to be quit of me, I &s;hould have &s;hut Barry's doors again&s;t my &s;weet &s;elf. However I propo&s;ed, over our claret, to take great pains with Woodward's favourite character of the Barber, and he might adverti&s;e my name for it in the manner of the original, which &s;eemed to plea&s;e Mo&s;&s;op much; a plain proof how we reli&s;h &s;atire again&s;t others, and how little we allow for it again&s;t our&s;elves: It was immediately brought forward.</P>
<P>The next day after being with Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, I waited on the attractive Abington, and importuned her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in Termagant, which &s;he good na|turedly complied with. She was at that juncture of time in her full bloom and prime of life: &s;he has had her day&mdash;Mi&s;s Farren now has her day; and &s;he, I hope, will live like the French beauty Madam Ninon de l'Enclos, who captivated her &s;on by her charms when &s;he was at the age of &s;eventy.</P>
<P>I told Mrs. Abington I &s;hould revive the Jealous Wife for my night, if &s;he would favour me with playing Mrs. Oakley, &s;he con&s;ented to &s;tudy it again&s;t the 22d of February. Indeed &s;he, that winter, as well as in 1760, paid me great civi|lities, and I never received a favour in my life that I was not grateful for, and ever ready and proud to acknowledge. It was &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;o truly good a comedy &s;hould have been in print
<PB N="80" REF="80">
two winters, and not brought forward properly at either of the Dublin theatres. We acted the Author three or four nights, and it was com|manded by their Graces the Duke and Duche&s;s of Northumberland; his Grace was at that time the Lord Lieutenant. The Uphol&s;terer was often repeated, and I was e&s;teemed &s;o very like Wood|ward in the part, by my having &s;o exactly copied his manner and dre&s;s, that I do not believe Col|ley Cibber's relation of his likene&s;s of Dogget in Fondlewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e was in truth beyond my exact repre|&s;entation of Woodward in the Barber. Lady Pentweazle al&s;o helped to make out my twelve nights, with the repeating the &s;ucce&s;sful comedy of the Jealous Wife, in which I acted Mr. Oak|ley. That year, early in March 1762, both the tragedy candidates Barry and Mo&s;&s;op, had fixed on performing Othello on the &s;ame Monday, for their benefit play. Mo&s;&s;op relying on his novelty, Barry on his long-e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation; the par|ti&s;ans prepared for battle, bets ran high and furious as in the pre&s;ent days for pugili&s;m. Mo&s;&s;op's holder of the &s;takes was the Counte&s;s of Brandon, heavy in demeanour, but alert in apprehen&s;ion. Her l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dy&s;hip &s;olicited his Grace the Duke of Nor|thumberland, to command Mo&s;&s;op's night, to which he generou&s;ly a&s;&s;ented; but wi&s;ely con|trived to occa&s;ion a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities between
<PB N="81" REF="81">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he two combatants, by promi&s;ing to Barry, that provided he would po&s;tpone his night to the Tue&s;|day, he would al&s;o command that evening's en|tertainment, by which means the town would be kept in good humour, the particular friends of each re&s;t &s;atisfied, and, his Grace al&s;o added, he &s;hould (by &s;uch attention and compliance from Mr. Barry) not be deprived the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him in his favourite character of Othello, which always afforded him the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction.&mdash;Barry of cour&s;e complied, and was not inwardly di&s;plea&s;ed that the critics (without a divi&s;ion) would have &s;uch an immediate opportunity to compare notes on the &s;kill and &s;uperiority of the declared opponents. On this remarkable occa&s;ion each hou&s;e was equally thronged, though Barry's on the Tue&s;day was the greate&s;t receipt, as Crow-&s;treet, was capable of containing more than Smock|alley; otherwi&s;e party zeal added to curio&s;ity, rai&s;ed auditors in &s;uch &s;uper-abundance as would have filled Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden theatres. As to victory, Barry's Othello was &s;o meritorious as to make Mo&s;&s;op's viewed at a di&s;tance only; he was as much &s;uperior in the va|liant Moor, as Mo&s;&s;op would have been to Barry in Richard or Zanga. I &s;at the evening of Mo&s;&s;op's benefit in an upper box, where a lady, who &s;at next me, exclaimed on Mo&s;&s;op's fir&s;t appearance, with
<PB N="82" REF="82">
an archne&s;s and humour peculiar to that nation, <Q REND="inline">"O! faith Mo&s;&s;op has got two eyes in his belly?"</Q> This &s;hrewd remark was occa&s;ioned by his wearing a heavy embo&s;&s;ed &s;hape, (fit for Brutus or Cato) a dragon's face on the brea&s;t, with two large gla|ring red &s;tones for the eyes, his face and wig being black, conveyed exactly what the lady had &s;o iro|nically expre&s;&s;ed. Mr. Barry, though ma&s;terly that night of controver&s;y, had frequently &s;hewn him&s;elf to more advantage, merely owing to his then taking too great pains in his favourite and much e&s;teemed part; which proves, that lucky ac|cidents fortunately combined with nature will per|chance &s;trike out more beauties for an arti&s;t than all the mo&s;t determined force of premeditation.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op that year had an Italian opera com|pany, which was of infinite &s;ervice to him, but a&s;toni&s;hingly hurt his own con&s;equence: for what with parties and other diver&s;ions of routs, a&s;&s;em|blies, concerts, &amp;c. with which Dublin in the winter abounds, and oppo&s;ed by the forces of Woodward and Barry (for they &s;till maintained their fa&s;hion and good report) the great box nights were chiefly confined to tho&s;e of the bur|lettas. That agreeable &s;inger and actre&s;s <HI>Signora De Amic&eacute;</HI> was the principal, and was almo&s;t ado|red; &s;he after that greatly &s;ucceeded at the opera hou&s;e in London, as the fir&s;t &s;erious woman &s;inger.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="83">
The&s;e Italian comic operas were all the rage, and were &s;upported at the following prices:&mdash;boxes, pit, and lattices, 5s. 5d.&mdash;middle gallery, 2s. 2d.&mdash;upper gallery, 1s. 1d. Dublin was then torn to pieces by the perpetual application for one theatre or the other; it was reduced quite to a party matter. The Counte&s;s of Brandon would not be &s;een at Crow-&s;treet upon any account, but attended con&s;tantly at her dear Mo&s;&s;op's.

<P>Mo&s;&s;op, when he had a good hou&s;e, in&s;tead of endeavouring to extricate him&s;elf in any degree from his multiplicity of difficulties, grew de&s;perate, and in&s;tead of paying either his trade&s;men or per|formers, flew to the gay circles, where he was gladly admitted; and in order to mend his bro|ken fortune by the chance of a die or the turn up of a card, of which I believe he was ignorant, and unacquainted with the nece&s;&s;ary arts to &s;ucceed. He has often left the theatre with a hundred gui|neas in his pocket, and returned home with an aching head and heart; but his guineas, with debts of honour, were all left behind. The Coun|te&s;s

of Brandon &s;erved him greatly it is true; but often the money &s;he occa&s;ioned being paid at the theatre returned to her own coffers. This was the univer&s;al opinion of Dublin, and is all I can alledge in that ca&s;e as to its authenticity; and, as to Mo&s;&s;op's poverty, there needs no evidence for that unfortunate reality.</P>
<P>This conduct, and a train of evils attendant thereon, &s;oon preyed upon his health, involved his talents with him&s;elf, and gave bitter &s;ours to that temper which was, in its natural &s;ource, far from being one of the be&s;t.

Abington: With Tea, Bucks have at ye All, and the farce of the Country Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>My engagement with Mo&s;&s;op being expired, I intended &s;oon leaving my old favourite &s;pot, which was now become a home; but was detained by Mrs. Abington's reque&s;ting I would &s;tay and a&s;&s;i&s;t her in a &s;cene of fun and humour for her benefit night, which &s;he had complied with at the re|que&s;t of her really good benefactor Lord Miltown. Mrs. Abington, had often entertained &s;everal gen|teel parties with &s;ome droll &s;tories of a good gen|tlewoman &s;he named Mrs. Fuz. I had been on parties with Lord Miltown and Lord Clambrazil, when in high &s;pirits and good humour, and had di|verted my&s;elf and the company with &s;tories and anecdotes, of my dear, favourite, old lady, Mrs. White, of whom the reader mu&s;t by this time have formed &s;ome idea, by referring back to what I have before related of my darling old gen|tlewoman's &s;ingularities.</P>
<P>Mrs. Abington had promi&s;ed Lord Miltown &s;he would produce her&s;elf as Mrs. Fuz, and &s;he would prevail on her friend Wilkin&s;on to do the &s;ame, as Mrs. Jenkins (alias Mrs. White); which information his Lord&s;hip made known to all fa|milies of di&s;tinction in Dublin: but the peer did not reflect, that tho&s;e &s;tories told by my&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Mrs. Abington, over the convivial table gave a kind of explanatory key to the &s;trange characters

and Sir Francis Delaval and Mr. Foote knew the mother and the daughters, as well as my&s;elf; but on a &s;tage where few of the audience were ac|quainted either with the character that Mrs. Abington or I repre&s;ented, the joke was as dif|ficult to find out as Mr. Bayes's laughing violent|ly at his own Prince Vol&s;cius, where the joke lay in the boots.&mdash;Her play was Rule a Wife&mdash;Leon, Mr. Mo&s;&s;op; Copper Captain, Mr. Brown:&mdash;E&s;tifania, Mrs. Abington. Between the play and farce, an interlude called Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Fuz. Mrs. Jenkins, Mr. Wilkin&s;on; Mrs. Fuz, Mrs. Abington. Before the night came, we often entertained our&s;elves with extempore rehear&s;als, and conceived our&s;elves ea&s;y, perfect, and entertaining. Mrs. Jenkins was dre&s;&s;ed before the play concluded. Mrs. Abington, after an epilogue of &s;hrewd turn, and &s;poke with great point, retired to dre&s;s as Mrs. Fuz; our dre&s;&s;es had been before well con&s;idered.&mdash;It was a crowded hou&s;e; part of the pit laid into the boxes. Mrs. Abington had ordered an excellent &s;upper, &s;uperbly lighted, &amp;c. and had wrote a little intro|ductory dialogue-&s;cene in the &s;treet between two gentlemen, giving a de&s;cription of a party they were that night invited to, and where two extra|ordinary characters were a&s;ked for the entertain|mentof the lady's gue&s;ts, at who&s;e hou&s;e the ren|dezvous was appointed; but each per&s;on was en|joined

to lay their fingers on their lips, and not to laugh on any account whatever, but to pay every mark of attention and approbation, in order that the two ladies might with more unlimited free|dom di&s;play their different ab&s;urdities. After the dialogue was fini&s;hed, the &s;cene was drawn up, and di&s;covered &s;everal well-dre&s;&s;ed ladies and gentle|men at &s;upper:&mdash;Mi&s;s Ambro&s;e was &s;itting at my elbow as the daughter of Mrs. Jenkins, who intended bringing her on the &s;tage:&mdash;Mrs. Fuz was &s;eated at one front corner of a long &s;upper table, and I was at the other: Mrs. Kelf was at the head as lady of the ceremonies, which was the only good part, for there were the &s;ervants with wine, and &s;he di&s;played on the occa&s;ion her being mi&s;tre&s;s of a good knife and fork. On being di&s;covered, and looking &s;cornfully at each other, our two figures had for &s;ome time a fine effect; loud fits of laugh|ter &s;ucceeded, and from the&s;e great expectations were formed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fuz then de&s;ired Mrs. Jenkins to begin&mdash;Mrs. Jenkins de&s;ired Mrs. Fuz would do the &s;ame&mdash;and we found our&s;elves in an aukward &s;ituation: But after a few efforts the two ladies entered into a hobbling &s;hort conver&s;ation, which was received very well, from the eager opinion that &s;omething better would follow, for the audience were all eyes and ears; but we &s;oon flagged: Mrs. Fuz a&s;ked for a gla&s;s of wine&mdash;&s;ays Mrs. Jenkins, <HI>upond</HI> my <HI>&s;ould</HI>

I hope Mrs. Abington has not forgot this, but will laugh at it as I do; though it was truly auk|ward at the time, and it really drew Lord Mil|town into di&s;grace, for he had &s;aid &s;o much in fa|vour of the promi&s;ed &s;cene, that it had been the conver&s;ation of the preceding week.</P>
<P>When the curtain dropped, which was with loud marks of cen&s;ure, the ladies univer&s;ally aro&s;e, and, by way of joke, laughed and courte&s;ied to each other, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Your &s;ervant, Mrs. Jen|kins; your &s;ervant, Mrs. Fuz!</Q>&mdash;which I dare &s;ay vexed his Lord&s;hip much, not only for his own and the di&s;appointment of the audience, but more &s;o, as any failure of Mrs. Abington's was morti|fying to him; for he was then, and I am told is now a mo&s;t violently attached and true patron and well-wi&s;her of hers. Mrs. Abington, in her epilogue after E&s;tifania, had &s;poke &s;ome lines very &s;arca&s;tically aimed at Mr. Woodward; who, to &s;peak truth, de&s;erved it at her hands: they were very &s;evere, and her being &s;o great a favourite, and delivering them mo&s;t excellently in Woodward's manner, &s;tung him to the quick.

I urged with truth that I feared a &s;econd benefit would fail, e&s;pecially as I had been honoured with &s;o many great ones, and that my friends in parti|cular would not like it, (which was really the ca&s;e). Woodward urged in pall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, that was his rea|&s;on for offering me twenty guineas, and he would not advi&s;e me to trouble or think of my friends attendance, &s;o lately called on, but inform them I did not exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ct th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ir app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arance again on that oc|ca&s;ion: and added, as you are on the &s;pot you had better continue five or &s;ix weeks; and if the receipt is but indifferent, it will be taking &s;o much without trouble: This &s;eemed fea&s;ible&mdash;I liked Dublin&mdash;and as it &s;uited my inclination, and was practicable, I con&s;ented; and I believe we had a third bottle as a &s;igning the contract.

that omi&s;&s;ion in the morning it begets inattention, and we fall into the pool of di&s;grace at night: So when the book was produced, it told in glaring letters that Mr. Dexter was the defaulter.

Great ex|pectations were formed, yet the attraction failed, and on his benefit in particular, which was the Monday after mine; for an influenza had &s;eized men, women, and children: I never was wor&s;e with any illne&s;s than at that time. Au&s;tin and I
<PB N="96" REF="96">
were in the middle gallery on his benefit night, when I do not believe there were twelve per&s;ons there be&s;ides, nor much more than 14l. in the hou&s;e, even though Mr. King played Bayes in the Rehear&s;al, and had to change his dre&s;s between two or three of the acts, for he &s;poke Bucks have at ye All! and acted in Mr. Garrick's Interlude of the Farmer's Return from London, and had his abilities, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a very good company, as may be &s;een in the bill of the Jealous Wife.</P>
<P>Mr. King's good &s;en&s;e will not be angry at this recital, for it is an in&s;tance of the power of fa&s;hion, more or le&s;s, in every place: But when Mr. King, a few &s;ea&s;ons after, returned, the people were not &s;o unwitted; for on his being adverti&s;ed to appear in Lord Ogleby, it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty a &s;eat could be obtained, not only for his fir&s;t night, but &s;everal &s;ucceeding ones; all ran in crowds to &s;ee their old favourite Tom King every time he performed, though a very bad &s;et of players to a&s;|&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>Dublin is remarkable for doing a great deal for the actor, or nothing; and if one particular part by a performer happens to plea&s;e their fancies and judgment, once a week to the end of the &s;ea|&s;on it will fill the hou&s;e.

preceding he ever made there; and was &s;o care&s;&s;ed and e&s;teemed by every one, that they were not con|tented when his fir&s;t engagement was fini&s;hed with the manager, and therefore he agreed for twelve nights more after Chri&s;tmas, which was equally beneficial with the fir&s;t: and the Iri&s;h ho&s;pitality was &s;uch, that it is well he got away with &s;afety; for wherever they e&s;teem, they are apt to endanger the healths of their gue&s;ts with acts of kindne&s;s. He then went to Scotland and performed four nights at Gla&s;gow, (which run in regular pro|gre&s;&s;ion, Tue&s;day, Wedne&s;day, Thur&s;day, and Friday) and each night to an overflowing hou&s;e.

<P>Owing to the influenza having confined me for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ome few days, and not having any engagement confirmed either in Ireland or England to call me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rom Dublin, I did not depart, though my engage|ment fini&s;hed on the 25th of May.

When the Orphan fini&s;hed, and Barry had, as the un|happy hu&s;band of Monimia, departed to the ima|ginary &s;hades, I in a few minutes informed Mr. Carmichael the prompter, that I was ready to give the whole hou&s;e Tea, tho' without cups and &s;au|cers; but ju&s;t when the curtain was drawing up, the &s;aid Carmichael came in a violent hurry and told me he came with peremptory orders from Mr. Barry, that I mu&s;t not on any pretext whatever attempt to proceed with my part of the entertain|ment for the evening until the end of Love A-la-Mode, and that Mr. Macklin in&s;i&s;ted on that in|junction being complied w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">th.</P>
<P>Mr. Macklin was ever tenacious of his favourite of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">spring, and he judged, I do conjecture, that any delay or laugh <HI>immediately after</HI> the tragedy from the audience might in &s;ome &s;mall degree take off the reli&s;h when Love A-la-Mode began.

<P>After inquiring as to the termination of the evening at the playhou&s;e, I was informed that all went on &s;moothly; the piece received the tribute due to its merit, and Macklin, Barry, Woodward, and Me&s;&s;ink a repetition of approbation which their re&s;pective merits had &s;o frequently obtained: Not one of the three leading per&s;onages had ca&s;t a thought on Wilkin&s;on, nor did they &s;uppo&s;e he would be called for; or if he was, that a &s;light apology from the manager of Mr. <HI>Tate's</HI> departure would &s;ettle all matters amicablv.</P>

<P>Wedne&s;day the 25th of Augu&s;t, The Rehear&s;al&mdash;the fir&s;t time I ever acted Bayes.</P>
<P>The company was &s;ummoned by Mr. Yates to Pre&s;ton on account of the jubilee, which is kept there with great fe&s;tivity, and celebrated every twenty-one years:&mdash;he had engaged &s;everal principal Lon|don performers. I returned back to Che&s;ter, be|ing eager to &s;ee my friend Smith and family, and other new acquaintance at that place; but I made my journey thither a plea&s;ant round, and took Pre|&s;ton in my way: I met Mr. Sowden coming from Ireland on the road, and he turned back and wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="109" REF="109">
with me to the Jubilee, and then to &s;tay with me a few days at Che&s;ter. At Pre&s;ton we found very bad accommodations, very dear, very dirty, and much crowded. The proce&s;&s;ion was tolerable, but not worth the trouble or expence of a jour|ney to &s;ee it; indeed I was very glad on the &s;e|cond day to per&s;uade Mr. Sowden to quit Pre&s;ton for Che&s;ter, for it was all confu&s;ion and mire, ex|cept the main &s;treet, which I recollect is &s;pacious and hand&s;ome, but it was the crowd and incon|veniency that made us glad to depart; and we went from thence to Liverpool, where I had ne|ver before been; and after one day's view we cro&s;&s;ed in the Ea&s;t Ferry to Che&s;hire, where we ordered a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and got in good time to dinner at Che&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Sowden's intimacy with me began the win|ter before at Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's theatre, where he was a &s;ub-manager at that time. He was a &s;en&s;ible &s;hrewd bred man, looked on in general as remark|ably in&s;incere; not that I ever met with any thing from him in any re&s;pect, but the oppo&s;ite conduct. I once went with him from Dublin to Wicklow (a plea&s;ant ride) to receive &s;ome rents there: He was very entertaining, and a great epicure: He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ample fortune, the con&s;equence of being a good economi&s;t, and well knowing how to lend his money to great advantage, yet not
<PB N="110" REF="110">
without good &s;ecurity: He made him&s;elf generally plea&s;ing, as he never contradicted any body, or di&s;|liked any thing at another per&s;on's table, but al|ways approved. If a gentleman had &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sowden, that cabbage-leaf tho&s;e &s;trawberries are on is a fine leaf?"</Q> he would have &s;worn a loud oath, that the cabbage-leaf not only was a hand&s;ome cabbage-leaf, but, by G&mdash;d! the hand&s;ome&s;t cabbage-leaf that ever grew. He was father to Mrs. Jack&s;on at Edinburgh, and I believe &s;he only came in for an incon&s;iderable part of his fortune; but of that Mrs. Jack&s;on is the only competent and proper judge; and I &s;incerely hope my conjecture may be quite wrong for her &s;ake.</P>
<P>From Che&s;ter I went to London, where I had not paid my dutiful re&s;pects for &s;everal months, and there had a welcome not to be &s;u&s;pected. From thence, for a few nights, I paid a vi&s;it on the eve of the peace being &s;ettled between France and England, to my brandy company of the old thea|tre at Port&s;mouth; the Bath commander had left that place for his regular winter quarters: &s;hips of war were &s;ailing daily into the harbour to be paid off, con&s;equently money was plenty, and the theatre well filled. I had not vi&s;ited my friends for a full year, I was therefore a kind of novelty, be&s;ides having attained a &s;upply of new characters. The 20th of October, 1762, I acted Lear, al&s;o
<PB N="111" REF="111">
Bayes, &amp;c. and fini&s;hed with a crowded benefit and well-plea&s;ed theatre. I have often wi&s;hed once more to walk tho&s;e ramparts, and take a re|tro&s;pect of my juvenile part of life, &s;o frequently employed on that &s;pot where I was then &s;o highly gratified with friends, plea&s;ure, and credit; when|ever opportunity offers, I will indulge my&s;elf for a few days with that trip. From Port&s;mouth I returned by the road through Sali&s;bury to Bath, where I expected without doubt an engagement; but there my vanity or my hopes, call it which you will, were fru&s;trated as to the theatre. Mr. Ar|thur thought I a&s;ked too much, and I, that he of|fered too little; in con&s;equence thereof Mr. Simp&s;on of the great rooms obliged me with them to exhibit in; and actually I had, to a jum|bed, ill-conducted medley, at 3s. per ticket, not le&s;s than 60l. and I was at very little expence, Mr. Fleming leading <HI>gratis;</HI> in &s;hort, the night was univer&s;ally fa&s;hionable, and every body was willing to &s;erve me, which ea&s;ily accounts for any &s;ucce&s;s of that kind however wonderful it may appear. It actually had &s;uch general &s;anction, that the theatre was &s;o de&s;erted as to be obliged to be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed for the want of an audience on that even|ing; an in&s;tance perhaps never before or &s;ince there, within living memory. I had a &s;econd night on Thur&s;day, Dec. 16, and very genteely
<PB N="112" REF="112">
attended, 35l.; it was much better conducted and approved, and would have been more lucrative had my fir&s;t been more properly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Bri&s;tol, where I had never before been, and on Tue&s;day, February 1&s;t, I had a mo&s;t brilliant and crowded audience, at the a&s;&s;embly room, in Prince&s;s-&s;treet. Mr. Flem|ing a&s;&s;i&s;ted me again as leader, and gave his Qua|ker's Sermon on his violin; for which he was much admired and applauded, and was truly a worthy man, and univer&s;ally e&s;teemed; he was father to the Mi&s;s Flemings now of Bath. I re|turned the compliment in a &s;mall degree by once performing for his benefit at William Wilt&s;hire's rooms on the 28th November, 1764, at Bath; but he a&s;&s;i&s;ted me twice there, and twice at Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>I was much obliged to the ladies and gentlemen at Bri&s;tol for their general patronage, and their kindne&s;&s;es &s;hewn me on tho&s;e nights, as except Mr. Church at the White Lion, Broad-&s;treet, Bri&s;tol, I did not know even the names of three people in that opulent city, my whole time there was entirely confined to Mr. and Mrs. Church.

<P>On my recovery, from thence I returned by Bath to London, for a few days recreation, and then &s;et off on an invitation I had received from Mr. Ivory, manager of the Norwich theatre; &s;o there was another new trip. Mr. Hur&s;t (whom I had known in Ireland) was appointed the di|recting manager, and I believe was the occa&s;ion of the offer. Mr. Hur&s;t I had often met in my ad|venturing
<PB N="114" REF="114">
(as Garrick termed it) and his beha|viour at Norwich was kind and attentive to a de|gree both as to my profit, when my benefit was to be fixed, and in every other particular. In return I really underwent infinite labour; for he worked me not as an hor&s;e of blood; but as an hor&s;e for burthens, I even now &s;ink at the very thought of how I drudged and toiled in that theatrical Nor|wich mine.</P>
<P>On Monday, February 29, 1763, I played Othello; on Saturday, March 5, the Minor. Mr. Banni&s;ter, &s;enr. was there, and took his fir&s;t ideas of mimicry from &s;eeing me play tho&s;e parts in the Minor, Cadwallader, and other of Mr. Foote's pieces. My playing in the Minor drew <HI>repeated</HI> and <HI>increa&s;ing</HI> good hou&s;es. This may appear as a &s;tretch; but Mr. Dodd was there, to who&s;e &s;ervices I have been much obliged at York: he was a reigning favourite at that time, and I call on him to vouch, that tho' the city of Norwich is not the mo&s;t theatrical town in the kingdom, yet that audience to any piece that is well received will bear a more repeated acting of it than any other town of the &s;ize whatever. I think the Padlock was acted twenty-five nights the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on; now, that to be accompli&s;hed from its production there with only four plays, or but three in a-week, I look upon to be equal to fifty times in London.
<PB N="115" REF="115">
Norwich &s;ea&s;on was then five months. I acted Bayes four play nights progre&s;&s;ively&mdash;Saturday, March 12, Monday 14, Tue&s;day 15, and Thur&s;|day 17. The Rehear&s;al was much liked, though not calculated for any audience <Q REND="inline">"to pit, box, and gallery it"</Q> out of the meridian of London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Bath, or York.

<P>It was &s;oon after my departure circulated, and even put at length into the new&s;papers (which mu&s;t be true) that I was obliged to &s;ecure my per&s;onal &s;afety by flight, that I ordered a po&s;t chai&s;e with four hor&s;es, took all the money which had been received that night into a large &s;ilk handkerchief, without waiting to count if all was right, and got out of Norwich with all expedition, le&s;t I &s;hould have been torn in pieces by the enraged multitude; and when I arrived in London, they &s;aid Wilkin|&s;on laughed at the Norwich flats, and an hundred ridiculous fal&s;ehoods of that kind were propagated, and handed carefully down by that generation and piou&s;ly tran&s;mitted to their children. Now the
<PB N="119" REF="119">
plain matter of fact was no more than by not &s;a|tisfying them really with the eager expected Tea, the thir&s;t for which was &s;o great that I verily be|lieve had Mr. Garrick been King Lear they would have thought the play had been too long; but when they found no Tea, they did not reli&s;h what I was doing as the way by any means to make them amends for the in&s;ult they &s;uppo&s;ed I had wilfully given to their under&s;tandings; but what was more, my likene&s;s of Mr. Barry, Mr. Sparks, or any of the London performers was Greek to them; and it was natural for them not to admire what they could not by any means comprehend. The difference of audiences in &s;uch like circum&s;tances is amazing. A farce, if it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es true humour, in London will be greatly reli&s;hed and applauded: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the country very po&s;&s;ibly the &s;ame (even de|cently acted) &s;hall be termed vile, low, vulgar, and indelicate.

of the Edinburgh and York actors; a London audience &s;o tried would feel not only chagrined and di&s;appointed, but would give &s;uch tokens of re&s;ent|ment and anger, as would far exceed that of the enraged Norwichers. My farce that night helped to confirm my di&s;grace; for out of London certainly no one was &s;o very likely to di&s;plea&s;e as Mr. Foote's Orators, not only quite ob&s;olete but local: let any per&s;on now take it up of the age of twenty|five, and it will puzzle the be&s;t head to find out or comprehend how at that time, even in London, an audience could po&s;&s;ibly be entertained by it, however well acted. The porter-club, the la&s;t &s;cene of the farce, gave it a complete overthrow, though a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. We&s;ton; their patience was quite exhau&s;ted, and I could barely make a fini&s;h.

<P>Another cu&s;tom was, after the play the perfor|mer was to return thanks, and if married, both hu&s;band and wife to appear. Mr. Frod&s;ham once at York &s;poke a comic epilogue on his benefit night, and actually carried his wife (now living) on and off the &s;tage on his back, to comply with the expected homage:&mdash;on particular occa&s;ions four or five children to make up weight, courte&s;ying and bowing in frocks, had a wonderful effect, as the audience in general, and the ladies in parti|cular, prided them&s;elves upon be&s;towing their bounty on &s;uch a pains-taking man, or &s;uch a pains-taking couple as they proved them&s;elves to be. Tho' I had heard &s;o much of tho&s;e cu&s;toms, yet I was honourably received after all my alledged ILL-BEHAVIOUR <HI>at Norwich,</HI> as u&s;ual, with much plea&s;antry and good humour. The la&s;t night of my acting there I made as polite an acknowledgement as lay in my power, and meant what I &s;aid, that I really thought my&s;elf, as a &s;tranger at Norwich, particularly honoured and obliged; which coming unexpectedly was received with double effect, and I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with great glory and marks of ap|probation;
<PB N="130" REF="130">
and the audience were not a little plea&s;ed that I confe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf indebted to them for the favours they had conferred on me.</P>
<P>Now, after &s;uch particulars, it is really a&s;toni&s;h|ing how &s;uch fal&s;ehoods to the contrary could be propagated and believed from that time 1763, and never cleared up till 1787, when I was la&s;t at Norwich, and will be much more &s;o by this faith|ful account. Another &s;trange cu&s;tom they had at Norwich, and if aboli&s;hed it has not been many years, which was for a drummer and a trumpeter (not the King's) in every &s;treet to proclaim in an audible voice, having been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his &s;hrill notes to &s;ummons each garreteer, without which ceremony the gods would not &s;ubmit to de&s;cend from their heights into the &s;treets to inquire what play was to be acted, nor a&s;cend into the gallery.</P>
<P>A cu&s;tom of this kind prevailed &s;o far with a Mr. Herbert's Lincoln&s;hire company in the time of our revered, well-remembered, and beloved Marquis of Granby, that when at Grantham the players determined to omit the u&s;ual ceremony of the drum, wi&s;hing to grow more polite; and by ob&s;tinate per&s;everance, Lady Jane Gray, Mary Queen of Scots, King Henry the Eighth, the King of France, nay even Cardinal Wol&s;ey had no command, attraction, or power over the popu|lace when they lo&s;t their accu&s;tomed and &s;o much
<PB N="131" REF="131">

an engagement, which he hoped would prove la&s;ting and advantageous to both; that in many pieces, dividing the parts, would be better for each of us; for however clever he might flatter him&s;elf to be from his own opinion and the par|tiality of the public, he was convinced one per&s;on perpetually before the audience, be he ever &s;o ex|cellent and meritorious, had not &s;o great an ad|vantage as by a little &s;pace ere he was &s;een again: (a certain good remark for me then, and many young performers now, to remember).

<P>What made Mr. Foote &s;o very generous, open, and explicit, was, that he judged it would be lu|crative to him if he complied as to terms.</P>
<P>So it plainly appears that a war of five years was amicably and honourably concluded, with a peace not inglorious, but equitably adju&s;ted for the advantage of both parties, and from that time not any bickerings or breach of treaties happened between us to the time of his death, in the au|tumn &s;ea&s;on 1777.&mdash;Peace to his manes!

<P>From Norwich I took a trip to York, where I had never been, and entered into a treaty with Mr.

<P>As my Norwich engagement fini&s;hed on Sunday April the 16th, I intended quitting that place on the Monday morning following; but as I had grown rich, I at that time was wonderfully prudent, and determined on a &s;aving &s;cheme: So I gave up all idea of travelling &s;o far as York, and lol|ling all the way in a po&s;t-chai&s;e. Therefore the only prudent method was to go in the Monday morning's coach as far as Newmarket, but I could not be permitted to take a place for half way, unle&s;s they were left empty for want of London pa&s;&s;en|gers; which was and is, I believe, &s;till the con&s;tant cu&s;tom. I was called up early on the Monday morning to be ready for the coach; but judge my di&s;appointment and chagrin, when on my approach I found it chuck-full, as is often &s;aid at the the|atre. What was to be done? A po&s;t-chai&s;e I could not think of, on account of the charge:&mdash;There was no time allowed for con&s;ideration, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ll was prepared and ready at the Maid's Head for in&s;tant procedure.

<P>The &s;tage coaches then were not hung on &s;prings as they are at pre&s;ent, nor were the roads near &s;o good:&mdash;The coach was then double the time in performing the journey. We arrived at New|market, where, though I produced my&s;elf as an out&s;ide pa&s;&s;enger, I was permitted the honour of being treated at table as an in&s;ide gue&s;t; for they all knew me and pitied my &s;ituation, but naturally preferred my &s;uffering &s;ome torment, rather than being mi&s;erably &s;towed them&s;elves by cramming the vehicle as if loaded with Norwich turkies at Chri&s;tmas, and that merely to accommodate a &s;tranger.

<P>Mrs. Mozeen, whom I believe I have mention|ed as being a favourite actre&s;s at Port&s;mouth in 1758, was at Edinburgh 1764, under the wings of a long tall Northumberland manager of Edin|burgh, who&s;e name was <HI>Dow&s;on,</HI> cojointly with a Mr. Bates.

I ea&s;ily &s;ur|mi&s;ed by that conver&s;ation they meant to be very courtier-like and civil, but wanted not any en|gangement that was likely to co&s;t them any thing. I found I had undertaken an expen&s;ive tedious journey, merely on &s;peculation, and condemned my&s;elf as having acted wrong in &s;o doing, and really thought I might as well have been lucra|tively paid at that time by Mr. Barry, who had had me at his bed&s;ide reque&s;ting me to &s;tay a

Mr. Frod&s;ham was not to be found to &s;upply my place, and the audience were obliged to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and as the world is too fond of any tale that feeds its appetite for &s;candal, however gro&s;s, ab&s;urd, and even impo&s;&s;ible, &s;o in that in&s;tance did I &s;uffer mo&s;t inhumanly by the fal&s;ehoods

So the&s;e different tales of &s;candal were all &s;ent piping hot north, &s;outh, ea&s;t, and we&s;t, and the &s;imple matter of fact was neither more nor le&s;s than my being truly and dangerou&s;ly ill So, in|&s;tead of pity, I heard of nothing but reproach, &s;pite, unmerited abu&s;e, and malevolence.

<P>On the Monday at York, 1764, though my illne&s;s was very little abated, in &s;pite of abu&s;e, and in &s;pite of prudence, (having naturally at times a touch of the head-&s;trong) I per&s;i&s;ted in being an|nounced for Major Sturgeon on the Tue&s;day, May 1, 1764. Several per&s;ons called at Mr. Ba|ker's de&s;iring me not to play, for I &s;hould cer|tainly be in&s;ulted; urging al&s;o, that my &s;tate of health made it wrong to attempt it: However, on that &s;aid appointed Tue&s;day, I pre&s;ented my&s;elf in Major Sturgeon, when on my entrance the wrongs the audience had &s;u&s;tained (as they termed it) by their patience and forbearance the year before, and &s;uch in&s;olence added to drunkenne&s;s none but &s;uch good tempers would have permitted, there|fore an univer&s;al hi&s;s, with two or three <HI>un</HI>civil oranges bur&s;t at once on my devoted head.

at my exit received every mark of di&s;grace.&mdash;What I got for my labour the next day was, that I need not think of playing Major Sturgeon after Mr. Achurch, as he performed it &s;o much better; and they wondered, as I acted at York again, I did not a&s;k pardon for my in&s;ults to that public.</P>
<P>It is no more &s;trange than true, though all this vexed and truly mortified me, yet it rou&s;ed my &s;pirits in part from that languor my bad &s;tate of health had thrown me into, as I really did not expect I &s;hould have remained long in this world, but &s;oon &s;hut out day-light.</P>

The old di&s;h of the Minor was in July ap|pointed for my fir&s;t on&s;et, which Mr. Foote had not acted, but had deferred, (in the interim won|dering at my delay):&mdash;and the Minor not having been acted at either theatre from September 1763 till that time, gave it a degree of novelty.

The Apprentice was al&s;o revived, which I acted very often to a crowded theatre.&mdash;It was commanded by the Duke of York as a fir&s;t piece, which occa&s;ioned the only little di&s;pute that in the Haymarket theatre ever occurred between Mr. Foote and my&s;elf.

<P>From a love of ca&s;h I performed five Saturdays for the &s;ixth to be clear, at the old theatre on Richmond Hill: Mr. Foote lent me his dre&s;&s;es, and my benefit was on Saturday, Augu&s;t 20, 1764, and was honoured with the &s;anction of the Duke of York. Lady Peter&s;ham and a large party were there, and I was favoured with a brilliant appear|ance: Mo&s;t of the little pit was laid into the boxes.

At the time of my expedition to Exeter there exi&s;t|ed at that place a mo&s;t eccentric genius and very par|ticular character, Mr. Andrew Brice, a printer.&mdash;He was to a degree remarkable in manner, figure, and a thou&s;and peculiarities that cannot be de|&s;cribed, but had accumulated by art, genius, and lucky circum&s;tances, an independent fortune:&mdash;George Faulkener, of Dublin, was by no means &s;uch an extraordinary being; be&s;ides, Mr. Faul|kener, as a man of benevolent and good qualities, mu&s;t ever be revered; but in the compari&s;on of goodne&s;s the rueful Andrew Brice &s;hould not be mentioned.&mdash;Alluding to Andrew Brice gives me authority, from Mr. King him&s;elf, to in&s;ert the following.</P>
<P>When Mr. Garrick wrote the character of Lord Ogleby, it was before he went to Italy; but on his return, and once more engaging with the fatigues of his theatre, he relinqui&s;hed all thoughts of acting that part, telling Mr. King, for his rea|&s;ons, that he found his &s;tate of health not equal to &s;u&s;tain the run of a new play; and that if he him&s;elf &s;hould play Lord Ogleby, it would lead into applications from authors to reque&s;t his per|forming in their pieces; to prevent which, he had come to a determination not to &s;tudy any new character whatever, and de&s;ired Mr. King would do the part&mdash;Mr. King begged to decline&mdash;Mr.

Garrick read it to that gentleman&mdash;The part he &s;till refu&s;ed even to the fourth time, and de&s;ired the part of Bru&s;h in&s;tead of Lord Ogleby.&mdash;Mr. Garrick &s;till continued pre&s;&s;ing, and Mr. King, fearing Mr. Garrick &s;hould think him more ob|&s;tinate than right, took the part to con&s;ider of it, and by paying clo&s;e attention when locked up in his &s;tudy, he accidentally repeated a few pa&s;&s;ages in a tremulous voice, which recurred to his ear as &s;omething &s;imilar to the &s;ound of old Andrew Brice's of Exeter:&mdash;He tried again and again, and found he had hit upon the very man as a natural and true picture to repre&s;ent Lord Ogleby. Mr. King went to Mr. Garrick and privately rehear&s;ed a &s;cene&mdash;Garrick was all a&s;toni&s;hed, and thun|dered out, <Q REND="inline">"By G&mdash;d, King, if you can but &s;u|&s;tain that fictitious manner and voice throughout, it will be one of the greate&s;t performances that ever adorned a Briti&s;h theatre."</Q> Mr. Garrick's prophecy was verified, as Mr. King's manner of producing that character before the public was then, and is to this day, one of the mo&s;t capital and highly-fini&s;hed pieces of acting with which any audience ever was treated, and will never be forgotten while a trait of Mr. King can be re|membered.

<P>Andrew Brice, in figure and tremulous manner, was exactly what Mr. King appears to be in Lord Ogleby; and I could have forgiven Brice had he painted like his Lord&s;hip: for he had &s;o much of the lily in his complexion, that he looked (tho' one of the neate&s;t) the mo&s;t corp&s;e-like Manda|rine figure I ever beheld in the various productions of Human Nature.</P>
<P>When I acted Bayes at Exeter, and &s;poke a &s;peech or two in his manner, it &s;truck the whole audience like electricity.&mdash;Mr. Jeffer&s;on, who per|formed John&s;on, was &s;o taken by the &s;urpri&s;e, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e could not proceed for laughter.&mdash;He is now at Exeter, and will, I am certain, recollect and cor|roborate that circum&s;tance.

&s;crene and &s;alubrious than almo&s;t any other part of the kingdom.&mdash;As a proof it is judged &s;o, I have known families, who have been in bad health, ordered by York&s;hire phy&s;icians to winter the &s;e|vere months at Exeter, as the <HI>Montpelier</HI> of Great Britain:&mdash;Good eating abounds there, and the market produces an uncommon variety of articles, all in the highe&s;t perfection:&mdash;I was there in the winter, and in January the face of the country looked well, and produced a verdure not u&s;ual at that inclement &s;ea&s;on in other parts of England.

We reached Edinburgh the fir&s;t week in February 1765: The theatre had &s;u&s;tained the lo&s;s of Mr. Digges and Mrs. Bellamy; the only true &s;upport was Mr. Aickin: There was, it is true, a Mr. Stamper, who had been a great favourite, but he was grown quite inebriated, and that from <HI>morning</HI> drinking: The company was much the &s;ame, except Mr. Stam|per, Mr. Cre&s;wick, a Mr. Parker and Mrs. Pye from Ireland; al&s;o Mr. and Mrs. M'George. We went on tolerably till Richard the Third was acted&mdash;a character at Edinburgh I was always particularly well received in, and with more than common applau&s;e; but during the &s;ummer &s;e&s;&s;ions in 1764 Mr. Sheridan had engaged for a certain number of nights, and on one of tho&s;e nights had acted Richard, at which time the want of a young gentleman or lady to &s;upply the part of Prince Ed|ward, rendered it impracticable to have the play acted, unle&s;s Mrs. Mozeen, who&s;e figure was neat and youthful, though bordering at that time on

the vale of years, would quit petticoat hopes, in Lady Anne, of royal coronation, and a&s;&s;ume the young monarch in expectation of the &s;ame honours. But in the winter Mrs. Wheeler's daughters, who promi&s;ed remarkably well on the &s;tage, &s;upplied the childrens' parts very ably Mrs. Mozeen expected her Lady Anne as her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ock part, and no &s;uppo&s;ition could be well|grounded for Mrs. M'George's taking offence at it; for though &s;he had played Lady Anne with Mr. Sheridan in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, &s;he mu&s;t have known it was nece&s;&s;ity and good-nature in Mrs. Mozeen to have re&s;igned Lady Anne for Prince Edward on a matter of emergency: which ob|&s;tacle being removed, and the children provided for the royal &s;tock, &s;he had double claim to former rights But on the night Richard was acted, in the &s;cene where Mrs. Mozeen in Lady Anne made her appearance, a general uproar en&s;ued, aye even to the pelting of the lady; the collegians, one and all, having formed a &s;evere party at the malevolent mi&s;repre&s;entations in&s;tigated by Mr. and Mrs. M'George, who&s;e wrongs were related with dou|ble force to the town, as being cruelly deprived o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lady Anne, a character in which &s;he had been re|ceived with &s;o much prai&s;e-worthy applau&s;e.&mdash;Mrs. M'George in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ended to have produced ano|ther Lady Anne to the wondering audience to la|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ent

a hu&s;band, but Manager Dow&s;on having been alarmed by authenticated intelligence that mi&s;chief was brewing, barricaded the entrances, and kept them double guarded by door-keepers, to prevent Roxana with her dagger from gaining ad|mittance behind the &s;cenes, and thereby wound|ing the bo&s;om of his beloved Statira. It was an hour before the uproar cea&s;ed; but Mrs. Mozeen evinced, if &s;he had a little body &s;he had a great &s;oul.</P>
<P>The audience were very attentive, and honoured me much that evening in every &s;cene, except where Lady Anne made her appearance, and then marks of rage, indignation, and contempt en&s;ued.&mdash;The riot did not &s;ub&s;ide with that night, but la&s;ted above a fortnight, and was carried to &s;uch ex|tremes, that not any ladies vi&s;ited the theatre from apprehen&s;ion of di&s;turbances and outrage. Ma|nager Dow&s;on, who paid adoration to his beloved Statira, even equal to the poet's fancy, levelled all his fury on her de&s;perate foe, Mrs. M'George, by an immediate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, which &s;troke of &s;udden impolicy at that juncture only &s;erved to enrage the more. Dow&s;on, &s;till faithful to his faithle&s;s mi|&s;tre&s;s, rather than Mrs. M'George's party &s;hould have reigned triumphant, I verily believe would have taken a torch at noon and &s;et our famed Per|&s;epolis on fire; but the Fates did what the ma|nager could not, for though the collegians gave
<PB N="262" REF="262">
ammunition and all manual a&s;&s;i&s;tance in Mrs. M'George's defence, yet they did not (or could not) afford to offer their pur&s;es; therefore, as provi&s;ions grew &s;canty, that tragic queen thought it more prudent and better general&s;hip to retreat than be &s;tarved by attacking a fortre&s;s &s;he found determined on ob&s;tinate defence, and which per|&s;everance &s;tood very little chance of &s;ubduing; nor would &s;he tru&s;t to the chance of war, which &s;eem|ed to threaten in&s;tant famine; and though &s;he had proved her ability to rai&s;e di&s;cord, &s;he plainly found &s;he could not in her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies: for if Dow&s;on could not pay his regiment with notes from the bank of Air, he could find remaining re&s;ources, and draw from Newca&s;tle; but the M'George's forces, tho' few, from de&s;ertions, had, to their &s;urpri&s;e, only the bank of <HI>air</HI> to rely on, &s;o off &s;he and her &s;pou&s;e went; and &s;oon after her departure, the cau&s;e of di&s;pute being removed, Time's lenient hand &s;pread over mutual faults, our theatrical wounds were healed, and peace and harmony once more re|&s;tored us to our pri&s;tine health and vigour.&mdash;This is no more, in the relation of our &s;tage battle at Edinburgh, than a &s;trict matter of fact, and can be atte&s;ted by a gentleman of well-known worth and veracity, Mr. Garenciers, now of York, who was at that time a &s;tudent at Edinburgh college.</P>

Treating on the &s;ubject of rio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s occa&s;ions my proceeding with a few anecdotes.</P>
<P>I remember in the winter of 1751 that <HI>that</HI> was the &s;ea&s;on Mrs. Cibber was fir&s;t attacked with her &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">omach complaint, and Barry, the divine Barry! either had, or pretended he had, frequent &s;ore throats and hoar&s;ene&s;&s;es: The comedies in which Mrs. Woffington was principal, were generally brought forward on the&s;e &s;ickne&s;&s;es of the trage|dians; and at the bottom of the bill, in which &s;he alone &s;tood capital, were generally announced the united names of Quin, Barry, and Cibber; of this &s;he con&s;tantly complained, and at la&s;t declared that the next time it happened &s;he would not play.&mdash;Shortly after Jane Shore was announced, Mrs. Cibber was ill, and the play changed late in the day, but I cannot &s;ay to what.&mdash;The next day the Con&s;tant Couple was put up: Sir Harry Wildair, Mrs. Woffington; with the great names at the bottom of the bill&mdash;Woffington kept her word; &s;ent a me&s;&s;age at five o'clock &s;he was ill, and po|&s;itively refu&s;ed to play&mdash;they were obliged to &s;ub|&s;titute the Mi&s;er; Lovegold, Mr. Macklin. By this time the public began to murmur at their frequent di&s;appointments, and took it into their heads that Mr. Rich, the manager, was very ill u&s;ed by his company, and determined on the next <HI>indi&s;po&s;ition</HI> they would interfere and re&s;ent for
<PB N="264" REF="264">
him. Preci&s;ely at this time Woffington made her refu&s;al, and on her next appearance in Lady Jane Grey the whole weight of their re&s;entment fell on her&mdash;whoever is living and &s;aw her that night will own they never beheld any figure half &s;o beautiful &s;ince&mdash;her anger gave a glow to her complexion, and even added lu&s;tre to her charming eyes; they treated her very rudely, bade her a&s;k pardon, and threw orange peels: She behaved with great re|&s;olution, and treated their rudene&s;s with glorious contempt; &s;he left the &s;tage, was called for, and with infinite per&s;ua&s;ion was prevailed on to return. However, &s;he did, walked forward, and told them &s;he was there ready and willing to perform her character if they cho&s;e to permit her; that the de|ci&s;ion was <HI>theirs, on</HI> or <HI>off,</HI> ju&s;t as they plea&s;ed, a matter of indifference to her.&mdash;The <HI>ons</HI> had it, and all went &s;moothly afterwards, though &s;he al|ways per&s;i&s;ted in believing that the party was ori|ginally formed by Mr. Rich's family and particu|lar friends, &s;ome of whom &s;he did not &s;cruple to name, though I believe &s;he always acquitted him of any knowledge of it.</P>
<P>It is often mentioned in the country that a ma|nager &s;hould prevent every riot&mdash;that a manager &s;hould be ready to an&s;wer on any frivolous occa|&s;ion&mdash;were that to be really &s;ubmitted to, how could Mr. Garrick dared to have had a palace at
<PB N="265" REF="265">
Hampton Court for his chief re&s;idence, or Mr. Harris live at Knight&s;bridge con&s;tantly, or be part of the &s;ea&s;on at Bath, entru&s;ting the care of the theatre and an&s;wers to the public in ca&s;e of un|fore&s;een particular di&s;turbances to Mr. Kemble, Mr. Lewis, or the principal actor then on the &s;pot, if danger or misfortune threatened?&mdash;The&s;e &s;uppo|&s;itions in the country leads to incendiary epi&s;tles. But how can &s;uch daemons, pretended friends, or &s;ecret enemies, be an&s;wered either as to their ill-will or affected good wi&s;hes, equally immaterial and not availing? as, be the contents right or wrong, true or fal&s;e, good or bad, it would be ri|diculous and really lo&s;s of time to an&s;wer what is avowedly fabricated by <HI>nobody.</HI> I had in con&s;e|quence thereof formed a re&s;olution in future never to read any one of the kind, and had in fact car|ried the re&s;olve into practice; but accident only broke the determination, for one morning la&s;t York races, on opening a letter and not perceiv|ing any name, I threw it on the table, which Mrs. W. peru&s;ed, and ha&s;tily declared I had an e&s;tate le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t me. I in&s;tantly took up Mr. Anony|mous, and read the following lines: <LETTER>

<P>I on inquiry was &s;oon informed by a mo&s;t re&s;pectable family in E&s;&s;ex, that the executors had been from &s;uch letters greatly plagued and tor|mented by different applications, and that one per&s;on had actually travelled &s;ome hundred miles, with great fatigue, trouble, perplexity, and ex|pence, to attain the Su&s;&s;ex e&s;tate, but was &s;oon after his arrival convinced it was all a bubble.</P>
