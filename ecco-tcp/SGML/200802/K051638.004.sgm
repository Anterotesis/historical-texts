<HEAD>THE <HI>EDITOR</HI> to the <HI>READER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF it may be thought rea&s;onable to cri|tici&s;e the Public Ta&s;te, in what are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be Works of mere Amu&s;ement; or mode&s;t to direct its Judgment, in what is offered for its Enter|tainment; I would beg leave to introduce the following Sheets with a few cur&s;ory. Remarks, that may lead the common Reader into &s;ome tolerable conception of the nature of this Work, and the de&s;ign of its Author.</P>
<P>THE clo&s;e connexion which every Indi|vidual has with all that relates to MAN in general, &s;trongly inclines us to turn our ob&s;ervation upon human affairs, prefer|ably to other attentions, and impatiently to wait the progre&s;s and i&s;&s;ue of them. But, as the cour&s;e of human actions is too &s;low to gratify our inqui&s;itive curio&s;ity,
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
ob&s;ervant men very ea&s;ily contrived to &s;a|tisfy its rapidity, by the invention of <HI>Hi|&s;tory.</HI> Which, by recording the principal circum&s;tances of pa&s;t facts, and laying them clo&s;e together, in a continued narration, kept the mind from langui&s;hing, and gave con&s;tant exerci&s;e to its reflections.</P>
<P>BUT as it commonly happens, that in all indulgent refinements on our &s;atisfactions, the Procurers to our plea&s;ures run into ex|ce&s;s; &s;o it happened here. Strict matters of fact, how delicately &s;oever dre&s;&s;ed up, &s;oon grew too &s;imple and in&s;ipid to a ta&s;te &s;timulated by the Luxury of Art: They wanted &s;omething of more poignancy to quicken and enforce a jaded appetite. Hence the original of the fir&s;t barbarous <HI>Romances,</HI> abounding with this fal&s;e pro|vocative of uncommon, extraordinary, and miraculous Adventures.</P>
<P>BUT &s;atiety, in things unnatural, &s;oon brings on di&s;gu&s;t. And the Reader, at length, began to &s;ee, that too eager a pur|&s;uit after <HI>Adventures</HI> had drawn him from what fir&s;t engaged his attention, MAN <HI>and his Ways,</HI> into the Fairy Walks of Mon|&s;ters and Chimeras. And now tho&s;e who
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
had run farthe&s;t after the&s;e delu&s;ions, were the fir&s;t that recovered them&s;elves. For the next Species of Fiction, which took its name from its <HI>novelty,</HI> was of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> in|vention. The&s;e pre&s;ented us with &s;ome|thing of Humanity; but of Humanity in a &s;tiff unnatural &s;tate. For, as every thing before was conducted by <HI>Inchantment</HI>; &s;o now all was managed by <HI>Intrigue.</HI> And tho' it had indeed a kind of <HI>Life,</HI> it had yet, as in its infancy, nothing of <HI>Manners.</HI> On which account, tho&s;e, who could not penetrate into the ill con&s;titution of its plan, yet grew di&s;gu&s;ted at the dryne&s;s of the Conduct, and want of ea&s;e in the Ca|ta&s;trophe.</P>
<P>THE avoiding the&s;e defects gave ri&s;e to the <HI>Heroical Romances</HI> of the <HI>French</HI>; in which &s;ome celebrated Story of antiquity was &s;o &s;tained and polluted by modern fable and invention, as was ju&s;t enough to &s;hew, that the contrivers of them neither knew how to lye, nor &s;peak truth. In the&s;e voluminous extravagances, <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Ho|nour</HI> &s;upplied the place of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Man|ners.</HI> But the over-refinement of Platonic &s;entiments always &s;inks into the dro&s;s and feces of that Pa&s;&s;ion. For in attempting a
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
more natural repre&s;entation of it, in the little amatory Novels, which &s;ucceeded the&s;e heavier Volumes, tho' the Writers avoided the dryne&s;s of the Spani&s;h Intrigue, and the extravagance of the French He|roi&s;m, yet, by too natural a repre&s;entation of their Subject, they opened the door to a wor&s;e evil than a corruption of <HI>Ta&s;te</HI>; and that was, A corruption of <HI>Heart.</HI></P>
<P>AT length, this great People (to whom, it mu&s;t be owned, all Science has been in|finitely indebted) hit upon the true Secret, by which alone a deviation from &s;trict fact, in the commerce of Man, could be really entertaining to an improved mind, or u&s;e|ful to promote that Improvement. And this was by a faithful and cha&s;te copy of real <HI>Life and Manners:</HI> In which &s;ome of their late Writers have greatly excelled.</P>
<P>IT was on this &s;en&s;ible Plan, that the Author of the following Sheets attempted to plea&s;e, in an E&s;&s;ay, which had the good fortune to meet with &s;ucce&s;s: That encou|ragement engaged him in the pre&s;ent De|&s;ign: In which his &s;ole object being <HI>Human Nature,</HI> he thought him&s;elf at liberty to draw a Picture of it in that light which
<PB N="v" REF="6">
would &s;hew it with mo&s;t &s;trength of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion; tho' at the expence of what &s;uch as read merely for Amu&s;ement, may fancy can be ill-&s;pared, the more artificial com|po&s;ition of a &s;tory in one continued Nar|rative.</P>
<P>HE has therefore told his Tale in a Series of Letters, &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by the Parties concerned, as the circum&s;tances related, pa&s;&s;ed. For this juncture afforded him the only natural opportunity that could be had, of repre&s;enting with any grace tho&s;e lively and delicate impre&s;&s;ions which <HI>Things pre&s;ent</HI> are known to make upon the minds of tho&s;e affected by them. And he appre|hends, that, in the &s;tudy of Human Nature, the knowlege of tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions leads us farther into the rece&s;&s;es of the Human Mind, than the colder and more general reflections &s;uited to a continued and more contracted Narrative.</P>
<P>THIS is the nature and purport of his At|tempt. Which, perhaps, may not be &s;o well or generally under&s;tood. For if the Reader &s;eeks here for Strange Tales, Love Stories, Heroical Adventures, or, in &s;hort, for any thing but a <HI>Faithful Picture of Nature</HI> in
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
<HI>Private Life,</HI> he had better be told before hand the likelihood of his being di&s;ap|pointed. But if he can find U&s;e or Enter|tainment; either <HI>Directions for his Con|duct,</HI> or <HI>Employment for his Pity,</HI> in a HISTORY <HI>of</HI> LIFE <HI>and</HI> MANNERS, where, as in the World it&s;elf, we find Vice, for a time, triumphant, and Virtue in di&s;tre&s;s, an idle hour or two, we hope, may not be unprofitably lo&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday Night, May</HI> 7.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN you reflect upon my unhappy &s;itua|tion, which is attended with &s;o many indelicate and even &s;hocking circum|&s;tances, &s;ome of which my pride will not let me think of with patience; all aggravated by the contents of my cou&s;in's affecting letter; you will not wonder, that the vapouri&s;hne&s;s which has laid hold of my heart, &s;hould ri&s;e to my pen. And yet it would be more kind, more friendly in me, to conceal from <HI>you,</HI> who take &s;uch a gene|rous intere&s;t in my concerns, that wor&s;t part of my griefs, which communication and complaint cannot relieve.</P>
<P>But to whom can I unbo&s;om my&s;elf but to you?&mdash;When the man who ought to be my protector, as he
<PB N="2" REF="9">
has brought upon me all my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, adds to my ap|prehen&s;ions; when I have not even a &s;ervant on who&s;e fidelity I can rely, or to whom I can break my griefs as they ari&s;e; and when his bountiful temper and gay heart, attach every one to him; and I am but a cy|pher, to give him &s;ignificance, and my&s;elf pain?&mdash;The&s;e griefs, therefore, do what I can, will &s;ome|times bur&s;t into tears; and the&s;e mingling with my ink, will blot my paper.&mdash;And I know you will not grudge me the temporary relief.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall go on in the &s;train I left off with in my la&s;t; when I intended rather to apologize for my me|lancholy. But let what I have above written, once for all, be my apology. My misfortunes have given you a call to di&s;charge the noble&s;t offices of the friend|&s;hip we have vowed to each other, in advice and con|&s;olation, and it would be an injury to it, and to you, to &s;uppo&s;e it needed even that call.</P>
<Q><P>She then tells Mi&s;s Howe, that now her cloaths are come, Mr. Lovelace is continually teazing her to go abroad with him in a coach, attended by whom &s;he plea&s;es of her own &s;ex; either for the air, or to the public diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>She gives the particulars of a conver&s;ation that has pa&s;&s;ed between them on that &s;ubject, and his &s;eve|ral propo&s;als. But takes notice, that he &s;ays not the lea&s;t word of the &s;olemnity which he &s;o much pre&s;&s;ed upon her before they came to town; and which, as &s;he ob&s;erves, was nece&s;&s;ary to give pro|priety to his propo&s;als.</P></Q>
<P>Now, my dear, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I cannot bear the life I live. I would be glad at my heart to be out of his reach. If I were, he &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee the difference. If I mu&s;t be humbled, it had better be by tho&s;e to whom I owe duty, than by him. My aunt writes in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er letter <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>III.</HI> p. <HI>251.</HI></NOTE>, that SHE dare not propo&s;e any thing in
<PB N="3" REF="10">
my favour. You tell me, that, upon inquiry, you find <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Vol.</HI> III. <HI>p.</HI> 272, 273.</NOTE>, that, had I not been unhappily &s;educed away, a change of mea&s;ures was actually re&s;olved upon; and that my mamma, particularly, was deter|mined to exert her&s;elf, for the re&s;toration of the family peace; and, in order to &s;ucceed the better, had thoughts of trying to engage my uncle Harlowe in her party.</P>
<P>Let me build on the&s;e foundations.&mdash;I can but try, my dear.&mdash;It is my duty to try all <HI>probable</HI> methods to re&s;tore the poor outca&s;t to favour.&mdash;And who knows but that once indulgent uncle, who has very great weight in the family, may be induced to inter|po&s;e in my behalf?&mdash;I will give up all right and title to my grandfather's beque&s;ts, with all my heart and &s;oul, to whom they &s;hall think fit, in order to make my propo&s;al palatable to my brother. And that my &s;ur|render may be effectual, I will engage never to marry.</P>
<P>What think you, my dear, of this expedient? Surely they cannot re&s;olve to renounce me for ever. If they look with impartial eyes upon what has happened, they <HI>will</HI> have &s;omething to blame <HI>them&s;elves</HI> for, as well as <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, that you will be of opinion, that this ex|pedient is worth trying. But here is my difficulty; If I &s;hould write, my hard-hearted brother has &s;o &s;trong|ly confederated every-body again&s;t me, that my let|ter would be handed about from one to another, till he had hardened every one to refu&s;e my reque&s;t; where|as, could my uncle be engaged to e&s;pou&s;e my cau&s;e, as from <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> I &s;hould have &s;ome hope; as I pre|&s;ume to think he would &s;oon have my mother, and my aunt, of his party.</P>
<P>What therefore I am thinking of, is this.&mdash;Suppo&s;e Mr. Hickman, who&s;e good character has gained him every-body's re&s;pect, &s;hould put him&s;elf in my uncle Harlowe's way? And as if, from your knowlege of
<PB N="4" REF="11">
the &s;tate of things between Mr. Lovelace and me, a&s;&s;ure him not only of the above particulars, but that I am under no obligations, that &s;hall hinder me from taking his directions?</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit the whole to your di&s;cretion, whether to pur&s;ue it at all, or in what manner. But if it be pur|&s;ued, and if my uncle refu&s;es to intere&s;t him&s;elf in my favour, upon Mr. Hickman's application, as from you (for &s;o, for obvious rea&s;ons, it mu&s;t be put), I can then have no hope; and my next &s;tep, in the mind I am in, &s;hall be, to throw my&s;elf into the protection of the ladies of his family.</P>
<P>It were an impiety to adopt the following lines, be|cau&s;e it would be throwing upon the decrees of Provi|dence a fault too much my own. But often do I re|volve them, for the &s;ake of the general &s;imilitude which they bear to my unhappy, yet unde&s;igned error.</P>
<Q><L>To you, great gods! I make my la&s;t appeal:</L>
<L>Or clear my virtues, or my crimes reveal.</L>
<L>If wand'ring in the maze of life I run,</L>
<L>And backward tread the &s;teps I &s;ought to &s;hun,</L>
<L>Impute my errors to your own decree;</L>
<L>My <HI>FEET</HI> are guilty; but my <HI>HEART</HI> is free.</L></Q>
<P>Mi&s;s Harlowe dates again on Monday, to let Mi&s;s Howe know, that Mr. Lovelace, on ob&s;erving her unea&s;ine&s;s, had introduced to her Mr. Mennell, Mrs. Fretchville's kin&s;man, who managed all her affairs [a young officer of &s;en&s;e and politene&s;s, &s;he calls him]; and who gave her an account of the hou&s;e and furni|ture, to the &s;ame effect that Mr. Lovelace had done before; as al&s;o of the melancholy way Mrs. Fretch|ville is in.</P>
<P>She tells Mi&s;s Howe, how extremely urgent Mr. Lovelace was with the gentleman, to get his &s;pou&s;e (as he now always calls her before company) a &s;ight of the hou&s;e: And that Mr. Mennell undertook that very
<PB N="5" REF="12">
afternoon to &s;hew her all of it, except the apartment Mrs. Fretchville &s;hould be in, when &s;he went. But that &s;he cho&s;e not to take another &s;tep till &s;he knew how &s;he approved of her &s;cheme to have her uncle &s;ounded; and what &s;ucce&s;s, if try'd, it would be at|tended with.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, in his humourous way, gives his friend an account of the Lady's peevi&s;hne&s;s and de|jection, on receiving a letter with her cloaths. He regrets that he has lo&s;t her confidence; which he at|tributes to bringing her into the company of his four companions. Yet he thinks he mu&s;t excu&s;e them, and cen&s;ure her for over-nicene&s;s; for that he never &s;aw men behave better, at lea&s;t not <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>Mentioning his introducing Mr. Mennell to her,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Now, Jack, &s;ays he, was it not very kind of Mr. Mennell, <HI>Captain</HI> Mennell, I &s;ometimes called him (for among the military men there is no &s;uch offi|cer, thou knowe&s;t, as a <HI>Lieutenant</HI> or an <HI>En&s;ign</HI>): Was it not very kind in him, to come along with me &s;o readily as he did, to &s;atisfy my beloved about the vapouri&s;h lady and the hou&s;e?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But who is Captain Mennell, methinks thou a&s;ke&s;t? I never heard of &s;uch a man as Captain Mennell.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Very likely. But knowe&s;t thou not young New|comb, 'hone&s;t Doleman's nephew?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O-ho! Is it he?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It is. And I have chang'd his name by virtue of my own &s;ingle authority. Knowe&s;t thou not, that I am a great name-father? Preferments I be&s;tow, both military and civil. I give e&s;tates, and take them away at my plea&s;ure. Quality too I create. And by a &s;till more valuable prerogative, I <HI>degrade</HI> by virtue of my own imperial will, without any other act of forfeiture than my own convenience. What a poor thing is a monarch to me!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But Mennell, now he has &s;een this angel of a wo|man, has qualms; that's the devil!&mdash;I &s;hall have enough to do to keep him right. But it is the le&s;s wonder, that he &s;hould &s;tagger, when a few hours conver&s;ation with the &s;ame lady could make four much more harden'd varlets find <HI>hearts</HI>&mdash;Only, that I am confident, that I &s;hall at la&s;t reward her virtue, if her virtue overcome me, or I &s;hould find it impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;evere.&mdash;For at times, I have confounded qualms my&s;elf. But &s;ay not a word of them to the Confraternity: Nor laugh at me for them thy&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P>In another letter, dated Monday night, he tells his friend, That the lady keeps him at &s;uch di&s;tance, that he is &s;ure &s;omething is going on between her and Mi&s;s Howe, notwith&s;tanding the prohibition from Mrs. Howe to both; and as he has thought it &s;ome degree of merit in him&s;elf to puni&s;h others for their tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, he thinks both the&s;e girls puni&s;hable for the breach of parental injunctions. And as to their let|ter-carrier, he has been inquiring into his way of living; and finding him to be a common poacher, a deer-&s;tealer, and warren-robber, who, under pretence of higgling, deals with a &s;et of cu&s;tomers, who con|&s;tantly take all he brings, whether fi&s;h, fowl, or ve|ni&s;on, he holds him&s;elf ju&s;tify'd (&s;ince Wil&s;on's con|veyance mu&s;t at pre&s;ent be &s;acred) to have him &s;tript and robbed, and what money he has about him given to the poor; &s;ince, if he take not money as well as letters, he &s;hall be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'To &s;erve one's &s;elf, &s;ays he, and puni&s;h a villain at the &s;ame time, is &s;erving public and private. The law was not made for &s;uch a man as me. And I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> come at corre&s;pondencies &s;o di&s;obediently carried on.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But, on &s;econd thoughts, if I could find out, that the dear creature carried any of her letters in
<PB N="7" REF="14">
her pockets, I can get her to a play or to a concert, and &s;he may have the misfortune to lo&s;e her pockets.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But how &s;hall I find this out; &s;ince her Dorcas knows no more of her dre&s;&s;ing or undre&s;&s;ing than her Lovelace? For &s;he is dre&s;&s;ed for the day, be|fore &s;he appears even to her &s;ervant.&mdash;Vilely &s;u&s;|picious!&mdash;Upon my &s;oul, Jack, a &s;u&s;picious temper is a puni&s;hable temper. If a lady &s;u&s;pects a rogue in an hone&s;t man, is it not enough to make the ho|ne&s;t man who knows it, a rogue?'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But as to her pockets, I think my mind hankers after them, as the le&s;s mi&s;chievous attempt.&mdash;But they cannot hold all the letters that I &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;ee. And yet a woman's pockets are half as deep as &s;he is high. Ty'd round them as balla&s;t-bags, I pre&s;ume, le&s;t the wind, as they move with full &s;ail, from whale-ribb'd canvas, &s;hould blow away the gyp&s;ies.'</Q></P>
<P>He then, in apprehen&s;ion, that &s;omething is medi|tating between the two ladies, or that &s;omething may be &s;et on foot to get Mi&s;s Harlowe out of his hands, relates &s;everal of his contrivances, and boa&s;ts of his in&s;tructions given in writing to Dorcas and to his &s;ervant Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Summers; and &s;ays, that he has pro|vided again&s;t every po&s;&s;ible accident, even to bring her back, if &s;he &s;hould e&s;cape, or in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould go abroad, and then refu&s;e to return; and hopes &s;o to manage, as that, &s;hould he make an attempt, whe|ther he &s;ucceed in it, or not, he may have a pre|tence to detain her.</P>
<P>He orders Dorcas to cultivate by all means her lady's favour; to lament her incapacity as to write|ing and reading; to &s;hew her lady letters from pre|tended country relations, and beg her advice how to an&s;wer them, and to get them an&s;wer'd; to be al|ways aiming at &s;crawling with a pen, le&s;t inky fingers &s;hould give &s;u&s;picions. And &s;ays, that he has given
<PB N="8" REF="15">
her an ivory-leaved pocket-book, with a &s;ilver pen|cil, that &s;he may make memoranda on occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The lady has already, he &s;ays, at Mrs. Sinclair's motion, removed her cloaths out of the trunks they came in, into an ample mahogany repo&s;itory, where they will lie at full-length, and which has drawers in it for linen.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A repo&s;itory, &s;ays he, that u&s;ed to hold the riche&s;t &s;uits which &s;ome of the nymphs put on, when they are to be dre&s;&s;ed out, to captivate or to ape quality. For many a counte&s;s, thou knowe&s;t, has our mother equipp'd; nay, two or three duche&s;&s;es, who live upon <HI>quality-terms</HI> with their lords. But this to &s;uch as will come up to her price, and can make an appearance like quality them&s;elves on the occa&s;ion: For the reputation of per&s;ons of birth mu&s;t not lie at the mercy of every under-degreed &s;inner.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A ma&s;ter-key which will open every lock in this che&s;t, is put into Dorcas's hands; and &s;he is to take care, when &s;he &s;earches for papers, before &s;he re|moves any thing, to ob&s;erve how it lies, that &s;he may replace all to a hair. Sally and Polly can oc|ca&s;ionally help to tran&s;cribe. Slow and &s;ure with &s;uch a lady mu&s;t be all my movements.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It is impo&s;&s;ible that one &s;o young and &s;o inexpe|rienced can have all her caution from her&s;elf; the behaviour of the women &s;o unexceptionable; no revellings, no company ever admitted into this inner-hou&s;e; all genteel, quiet, and ea&s;y, in it; the nymphs well-bred, and well-read; her fir&s;t di&s;gu&s;ts to the old one got over.&mdash;It mu&s;t be Mi&s;s Howe therefore, who once was in danger of being taken in by one of our cla&s;s, by hone&s;t Sir George Col|mar, as thou ha&s;t heard, that makes my progre&s;s difficult.'</Q></P>

<P>I Am a very unhappy fellow. This lady is &s;aid to to be one of the &s;weete&s;t temper'd creatures in the world: And &s;o I thought her. But to me, &s;he is one of the mo&s;t perver&s;e. I never was &s;uppo&s;ed to be an ill-natur'd puppy neither. How can it be? I imagin'd for a long while, that we were born to make each other happy: But, quite the contrary; we really &s;eem to be &s;ent to plague one another.</P>
<P>I will write a Comedy, I think. I have a title ready; and that's half the work. <HI>The Quarrel&s;ome Lovers.</HI> 'Twill do. There's &s;omething new and &s;triking in it. Yet, more or le&s;s, all lovers quarrel. Old Te|rence has taken notice of that; and ob&s;erves upon it, That lovers falling-out occa&s;ions lovers falling-in; and a better under&s;tanding of cour&s;e. 'Tis natural that it &s;hould be &s;o. But with us, we fall-out &s;o often, without falling-in once; and a &s;econd quarrel &s;o ge|nerally happens before a fir&s;t is made up; that it is hard to gue&s;s what event our loves will be attended with. But Shake&s;peare &s;ays;
<PB N="11" REF="18">

<L>Patience and time run thro' the roughe&s;t day.</L></Q>
And that &s;hall be my comfort. No man living bears cro&s;&s;es better than my&s;elf: But then they mu&s;t be of <HI>my own</HI> making: And even This is a great merit, and a great excellence, think what thou wilt: Since mo&s;t of the troubles, which fall to the lot of mortals, are brought upon them&s;elves, either by their <HI>too large</HI> de|&s;ires, or <HI>too little</HI> de&s;erts. But I &s;hall make my&s;elf a common man by-and-by: Which is what no one yet ever thought me. I will now lead to the occa&s;ion of this preamble.</P>
<P>I had been out. On my return, meeting Dorcas on the &s;tairs&mdash;Your lady in her chamber, Dorcas? In the dining-room, Sir: And if ever you hope for an opportunity to come at a letter, it mu&s;t be now. For at her feet I &s;aw one lie, which, by its open'd folds, &s;he has been reading, with a little parcel of others &s;he is now bu&s;ied with. All pulled out of her pocket, as I believe: So, Sir, you'll know where to find them another time.</P>
<P>I was ready to leap for joy, and in&s;tantly re&s;olved to bring forward an expedient which I had held in petto; and entering into the dining-room, with an air of tran&s;port, I boldly cla&s;ped my arms about her, as &s;he &s;at (&s;he huddling up her papers in her hand|kerchief all the time, the dropt paper un&s;een): O my deare&s;t life, a lucky expedient have Mr. Mennell and I hit upon, ju&s;t now. In order to ha&s;ten Mrs. Fretch|ville to quit the hou&s;e, I have agreed, if you approve of it, to entertain her cook, her hou&s;emaid, and two men-&s;ervants (about whom &s;he was very &s;olicitous), till you are provided to your mind. And that no accommodations may be wanted, I have con&s;ented to take the hou&s;hold linen at an apprai&s;ement.</P>
<P>I am to pay down 500 l. and the remainder as &s;oon as the bills can be look'd up, and the amount of them
<PB N="12" REF="19">
adju&s;ted. Thus will you have a charming hou&s;e in|tirely ready to receive you, and any of my friends. They will &s;oon be with you: They will not permit you long to &s;u&s;pend my happy day.&mdash;And that no|thing may be wanting to gratify your utmo&s;t punctilio, I will till then con&s;ent to &s;tay here at Mrs. Sinclair's, while you re&s;ide at your new hou&s;e; and leave the re&s;t to your own genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>O my beloved creature, will not this be agreeable to you? I am &s;ure it will&mdash;It mu&s;t&mdash;And cla&s;ping her clo&s;er to me, I gave her a more fervent ki&s;s than ever I had dared to give her before: But &s;till let not my ardor overcome my di&s;cretion; for I took care to &s;et my foot upon the letter, and &s;craped it farther from her, as it were behind her chair.</P>
<P>She was in a pa&s;&s;ion at the liberty I took. Bowing low, I begg'd her pardon; and, &s;tooping &s;till lower, in the &s;ame motion, took it up, and whipt it in my bo|&s;om.</P>
<P>Pox on me, for a puppy, a fool, a blockhead, a clum&s;y varlet, and a mere Jack Belford!&mdash;I thought my&s;elf a much cleverer fellow than I am!&mdash;Why could I not have been followed in by Dorcas; who might have taken it up, while I addre&s;&s;ed her lady?</P>
<P>For here, the letter being unfolded, I could not put it into my bo&s;om, without alarming her ears, as my &s;udden motion did her eyes.&mdash;Up &s;he flew in a moment: Traitor! Judas! her eyes fla&s;hing light|ning, and a perturbation in her eager countenance, &s;o charming!&mdash;What have you taken up?&mdash;And then, what for both my ears I dur&s;t not to have done to her, &s;he made no &s;cruple to &s;eize the &s;tolen letter, tho' in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Beg-pardon apologies were all that now remained for me, on &s;o palpable a detection. I cla&s;ped her hand, which had hold of the ravi&s;h'd paper, between mine: O my beloved creature! can you think I have not <HI>&s;ome</HI> curio&s;ity? Is it po&s;&s;ible you can be thus for

ever employed; and I, loving narrative letter-writing above every other &s;pecies of writing, and admiring your talent that way, &s;hould not (thus upon the dawn of my happine&s;s, as I pre&s;ume to hope) burn with a de&s;ire to be admitted into &s;o &s;weet a corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Let go my hand!&mdash;&s;tamping with her pretty foot: How dare you, Sir!&mdash;At this rate, I &s;ee&mdash;Too plainly I &s;ee&mdash;And more &s;he could not &s;ay: But, ga&s;ping, was ready to faint, with pa&s;&s;ion and affright; the devil a bit of her accu&s;tomed gentlene&s;s to be &s;een in her charming face, or to be heard in her mu&s;ical voice.</P>
<P>Having gone thus far, loth, very loth was I to lo&s;e my prize&mdash;Once more, I got hold of the rumpled-up letter!&mdash;Impudent man! were her words: Stamp|ing again: For God's &s;ake, then it was!&mdash;I let go my prize, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould faint away: But had the plea&s;ure fir&s;t to find my hand within both hers, &s;he trying to open my reluctant fingers. How near was my heart, at that moment, to my hand, throbbing to my fingers ends, to be thus familiarly, altho' angrily, treated by the charmer of my &s;oul!</P>
<P>When &s;he had got it in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he flew to the door: I threw my&s;elf in her way, &s;hut it, and, in the humble&s;t manner, be&s;ought her to forgive me: And yet do you think the Harlowe-hearted charmer would; notwith&s;tanding the agreeable annunciation I came in with?&mdash;No, truly! but pu&s;hing me rudely from the door, as if I had been nothing (yet do I love to try, &s;o innocently to try, her &s;trength too!); &s;he gaining that force through pa&s;&s;ion, which I had lo&s;t through fear; and out &s;he &s;hot to her own apart|ment [Thank my &s;tars &s;he could fly no further!]; and as &s;oon as &s;he enter'd it, in a pa&s;&s;ion &s;till, &s;he double-locked and double-bolted her&s;elf in.&mdash;This my com|fort, on reflection, that, upon a greater offence, it cannot be wor&s;e!</P>
<P>I retreated to my own apartment, with my heart full. And, my man Will. not being near me, gave
<PB N="14" REF="21">
my&s;elf a plaguy knock on the forehead, with my double fi&s;t.</P>
<P>And now is my charmer &s;hut up from me: Re|fu&s;ing to &s;ee me; refu&s;ing her meals: Re&s;olves <HI>not</HI> to &s;ee me, that's more;&mdash;Never again, if &s;he can help it.</P>
<P><HI>In the mind &s;he is in</HI>&mdash;I hope &s;he has &s;aid. The dear creatures, whenever they quarrel with their humble &s;ervants, &s;hould always remember this &s;aving clau&s;e, <HI>that they may not be for&s;worn.</HI></P>
<P>But thinke&s;t thou that I will not make it the &s;ub|ject of one of my fir&s;t plots, to inform my&s;elf of the rea&s;on why all this commotion was nece&s;&s;ary on &s;o &s;light an occa&s;ion, as this would have been, were not the letters that pa&s;s between the&s;e ladies of a trea&s;on|able nature?</P>

<P>No admi&s;&s;ion to breakfa&s;t, any more than to &s;upper. I wi&s;h this lady is not a &s;impleton, after all.&mdash;I have &s;ent up in Capt. Mennell's name. A me&s;&s;age from Capt. Mennell, Madam.</P>
<P>It won't do!&mdash;She is of a baby age: She cannot be&mdash;a Solomon, I was going to &s;ay, in every thing. Solomon, Jack, was the wi&s;e&s;t man:&mdash;But did&s;t ever hear who was the wi&s;e&s;t woman?&mdash;I want a compari&s;on for this lady: Cunning women and witches, we read of without number. But I fancy wi&s;dom never entered into the character of a woman. It is not a requi&s;ite of the Sex. Women, indeed, make better &s;overeigns than men: But why is that?&mdash;Be|cau&s;e the women &s;overeigns are governed by men; the men &s;overeigns by women:&mdash;Charming by my &s;oul! For hence we gue&s;s at the rudder by which both are governed. Yet, &s;orry puppy as thou art, thou make&s;t light of me for my attachment to this Sex; and even of my ardors to the mo&s;t excellent one of it!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="22">But to put wi&s;dom out of the que&s;tion, and to take <HI>cunning</HI> in: That is to &s;ay, To con&s;ider woman <HI>as</HI> a woman; what &s;hall we do, if this lady has &s;omething extraordinary in her head?&mdash;Repeated charges has &s;he given for Wil&s;on, by a particular me&s;&s;enger, to &s;end any letter directed for her, the moment it comes.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t keep a good look-out. She is not now afraid of her brother's plot. I &s;han't be at all &s;ur|prized, if Singleton calls upon Mi&s;s Howe, as the only per&s;on who knows, or is likely to know, where Mi&s;s Harlowe is; pretending to have affairs of im|portance, and of particular &s;ervice to her, if he can but be admitted to her &s;peech. Of compromi&s;e, who knows, from her brother?</P>
<P>Then will Mi&s;s Howe warn her to keep clo&s;e; then will my protection be again nece&s;&s;ary. This will do, I believe. Any thing from Mi&s;s Howe mu&s;t.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph Leman is a vile fellow with her, and my implement. Jo&s;eph, hone&s;t Jo&s;eph, as I call him, may hang him&s;elf. I have play'd him off enough, and have very little further u&s;e for him. No need to wear one plot to the &s;tumps, when I can find new ones every hour.</P>
<P>Nor blame me for the u&s;e I make of my talents. Who, that had &s;uch, would let 'em be idle?</P>
<P>Well then, I will find a Singleton; that's all I have to do.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tantly</HI> find one!&mdash;Will.&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>This moment call me hither thy cou&s;in Paul Wheatly, ju&s;t come from &s;ea, whom thou wert re|commending to my &s;ervice, if I were to marry and keep a plea&s;ure-boat.</P>
<P>Pre&s;to&mdash;Will.'s gone!&mdash;Paul will be here pre&s;ent|ly!&mdash;Pre&s;ently will he be gone to Mrs. Howe's.&mdash;If Paul be Singleton's mate, coming from his captain, it will do as well as if it were Singleton him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="23">Sally, a little devil, often reproaches me with the &s;lowne&s;s of my proceedings. But in a play, does not the principal entertainment lie in the fir&s;t four acts? Is not all in a manner over, when you come to the fifth? And what a vultur of a man mu&s;t he be, who &s;ow&s;es upon his prey, and in the &s;ame moment tru&s;&s;es and devours?</P>
<P>But to own the truth, I have overplotted my&s;elf. To make my work &s;ecure, as I thought, I have frighted the dear creature with my four Hottentots, and I &s;hall be a long time, I doubt, before I can recover my lo&s;t ground. And then the&s;e cur&s;ed folks at Harlowe-Place have made her out of humour with me, with her&s;elf, and with all the world, but Mi&s;s Howe, who, no doubt, is continually adding difficulties to my other difficulties. And then I am very unwilling to have recour&s;e to mea&s;ures which the&s;e daemons below are continually urging me to take. And the rather, as I am &s;ure, that, at la&s;t, &s;he mu&s;t be legally mine. One complete trial over, and I think I will do her noble ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>WELL, Paul's gone!&mdash;Gone already!&mdash;Has all his le&s;&s;ons!&mdash;A notable fellow!&mdash;Lord W.'s nece&s;&s;ary-man was Paul before he went to &s;ea. A more &s;en|&s;ible rogue Paul than Jo&s;eph!&mdash;Not &s;uch a pretender to piety neither, as the other. At what a price have I bought that Jo&s;eph!&mdash;I had two to buy, in him&mdash;His con&s;cience, as well as the man.&mdash;I believe I mu&s;t puni&s;h the ra&s;cal at la&s;t: But mu&s;t let him marry fir&s;t: Then (tho' that may be puni&s;hment enough), as I bribed two at once in one man, I &s;hall puni&s;h two at once in the man and his wife.&mdash;And how richly does Betty de&s;erve it for her behaviour to my godde&s;s?</P>
<P>But now I hear the ru&s;ty hinges of my Beloved's door give me creaking invitation. My heart creaks and throbs with re&s;pondent trepidations: Whim&s;ical
<PB N="17" REF="24">
enough tho'! For what relation has a lover's heart to a ru&s;ty pair of hinges?&mdash;But they are the hinges that open and &s;hut the door of my Beloved's bed-chamber!&mdash;Relation enough in that!</P>
<P>I hear not the door &s;hut again. I &s;hall have her commands I hope anon.&mdash;What &s;ignifies her keep|ing me thus at a di&s;tance?&mdash;She mu&s;t be mine, let me do or offer what I will. Courage whenever I a&s;|&s;ume, all is over: For &s;hould &s;he think of e&s;caping from hence, whither can &s;he fly to avoid me? Her parents will not receive her: Her uncles will not en|tertain her: Her beloved Norton is in their direction, and cannot: Mi&s;s Howe dare not: She has not one friend in town but me: Is intirely a &s;tranger to the town. And what then is the matter with me, that I &s;hould be thus unaccountably over-awed and tyran|nized over, by a dear creature, who wants only to know how impo&s;&s;ible it is that &s;he &s;hould e&s;cape me, in order to be as humble to me, as &s;he is to her per|&s;ecuting relations?</P>
<P>Should I even make the grand attempt, and fail, and &s;hould &s;he hate me for it, her hatred can be but temporary. She has already incurred the cen&s;ure of the world. She mu&s;t therefore choo&s;e to be mine, for the &s;ake of &s;oldering up her reputation in the eye of that impudent world. For, who that knows me, and knows that &s;he has been in my power, tho' but for twenty-four hours, will think her &s;potle&s;s as to fact, let her inclination be what it will?&mdash;And then human nature is &s;uch a well-known rogue, that every man and woman judges by what each knows of them&s;elves, that inclination is no more to be tru&s;t|ed, where an opportunity is given, than I am; e&s;pe|cially where a woman young and blooming loves a man well enough to go off with him; for &s;uch will be the world's con&s;truction in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>She calls her maid Dorcas. No doubt, that I may hear her harmonious voice, and to give me an oppor|tunity
<PB N="18" REF="25">
to pour out my &s;oul at her feet; to renew all my vows; and to receive her pardon for the pa&s;t of|fence: And then, with what plea&s;ure &s;hall I begin up|on a new &s;core; and afterwards wipe out that; and begin another, and another; till the <HI>la&s;t</HI> offence pa&s;&s;es; and there can be no other. And once, after that, to be forgiven, will be to be forgiven for ever.</P>
<P>THE door is again &s;hut. Dorcas tells me, that &s;he denies to admit me to dine with her, as I had or|dered her to reque&s;t for me next time &s;he &s;aw her. Not uncivilly, however, denies. Coming to by de|grees! Nothing but the la&s;t offence, the hone&s;t wench tells me, in the language of her principals be|low, will do with her. The la&s;t offence is meditat|ing. Yet this vile recreant heart of mine plays me booty.&mdash;But here I conclude; tho' the tyranne&s;s leaves me nothing to do, but read, write, and fret.</P>
<P>Sub&s;cription is formal between us. Be&s;ides, I am &s;o totally hers, that I cannot &s;ay, how much I am thine, or any other per&s;on's.</P>

<P>I Much approve of your re&s;olution to leave this man, if you can have any encouragement from your uncle. And the rather, as I have heard but within the&s;e two hours &s;ome well-atte&s;ted &s;tories of him, that &s;hew him to be one of the wor&s;t of men as to our Sex.

<P>If ever you conde&s;cend to talk familiarly with him again, a&s;k him after Mi&s;s Betterton, and what became of her: And if he &s;huffle and prevaricate, que&s;tion him about Mi&s;s Lockyer.&mdash;O my dear, the man's a villain!</P>

<P>As your Hannah continues ill, I would advi&s;e you to try to attach Dorcas to your intere&s;t. Have you not been impoliticly &s;hy of her?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you could come at &s;ome of his letters. Sure|ly a man of his negligent character cannot be always guarded.

I am a&s;&s;ured by my new informant, that he is the head of a gang of wretches [Tho&s;e he brought you among, no doubt, were &s;ome of them], who join together to betray innocent creatures, and to &s;upport one another, when they have done, by violence: And were he to come at the knowlege of the freedoms I take with him, I &s;hould be afraid to &s;tir out without a guard.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to tell you, that I have rea&s;on to think, that your brother has not laid a&s;ide his fooli&s;h plot. A &s;un-burnt, &s;ailor-looking fellow was with me ju&s;t

My deare&s;t creature, do not de&s;ert your&s;elf: Let your Anna Howe obey the call of that friend&s;hip, which has united us as one &s;oul, and endeavour to give you con&s;olation.</P>
<P>I wonder not at the melancholy reflections you &s;o often ca&s;t upon your&s;elf in your letters, for the &s;tep you have been forced upon, on one hand, and tricked into on the other. A &s;trange fatality! As if it were de&s;igned to &s;hew the vanity of all human prudence. I wi&s;h, my dear, as you hint, that both you and I have not too much prided our&s;elves in a perhaps too con&s;cious &s;uperiority over others&mdash;But I will &s;top&mdash;How apt are weak minds to look out for judgments in any extraordinary event!

<P>But do not talk, as in one of your former, of be|ing a warning <HI>only</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>III.</HI> p. <HI>153.</HI></NOTE>.&mdash;You will be as excellent an example, as ever you hoped to be, as well as a warn|ing: And that will make your &s;tory, to all that &s;hall come to know it, of double efficacy: For were it that &s;uch a merit as yours could not en&s;ure to her&s;elf noble and generous u&s;age from a libertine heart, who will ex|pect any tolerable behaviour from men of his character?</P>
<P>If YOU think your&s;elf inexcu&s;able for taking a &s;tep that put you into the way of delu&s;ion, without any intention to go off with him, what mu&s;t tho&s;e giddy creatures think of them&s;elves, who, without half your provocations and inducements, and without any re|gard

<P>Come, come, my deare&s;t friend, con&s;ider but the&s;e things; and &s;teadily, without de&s;ponding, pur&s;ue your earne&s;t purpo&s;es to amend what you think has been ami&s;s; and it may not be a misfortune in the end, that you have erred; e&s;pecially as &s;o little of your will was in your error.</P>
<P>And, indeed, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I u&s;e the words <HI>mi&s;|led,</HI> and <HI>error,</HI> and &s;uch-like, only in compliment to your own too ready &s;elf-accu&s;ations, and to the opi|nion of one to whom I owe duty: For I think in my con&s;cience, that every part of your conduct is defen|&s;ible; and that tho&s;e only are blameable, who have no other way to clear them&s;elves, than by condemn|ing you.</P>
<P>I expect, however, that &s;uch melancholy reflec|tions, as drop from your pen but too often, wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mingle with all your future plea&s;ures, were you to marry I ovelace, and were he to make the be&s;t of hu&s;bands.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="30">You was immen&s;ely happy, above the happine&s;s of a mortal creature, before you knew him: Every|body almo&s;t wor&s;hiped you: Envy it&s;elf, which has of late reared up its venomous head again&s;t you, was awed by your &s;uperior worthine&s;s, into &s;ilence and ad|miration. You was the &s;oul of every company where you vi&s;ited: Your elders have I &s;een declining to offer their opinions upon a &s;ubject, till you had de|livered yours; often to &s;ave them&s;elves the mortifica|tion of retracting <HI>theirs,</HI> when they heard <HI>yours.</HI> Yet, in all this, your &s;weetne&s;s of manners, your humility and affability, cau&s;ed the &s;ub&s;cription every one made to your &s;entiments, and to your &s;uperiority, to be equally unfeigned and unhe&s;itating; for they &s;aw, that their applau&s;e, and the preference they gave you to them&s;elves, &s;ubjected not them&s;elves to in&s;ults, nor exalted you into any vi&s;ible triumph over them; for you had always &s;omething to &s;ay, on every point you carried, that rai&s;ed the yielding heart, and left every|one plea&s;ed and &s;atisfied with them&s;elves, tho' they carried not off the palm.</P>
<P>Your works were &s;hewn, or referred to, where|ever fine works were talked of. Nobody had any but an inferior and &s;econd-hand prai&s;e for diligence, for oeconomy, for reading, for writing, for memory, for facility in learning every-thing laudable, and even for the more envied graces of per&s;on and dre&s;s, and an all-&s;urpa&s;&s;ing elegance in both, where you were known, and tho&s;e &s;ubjects talked of.</P>
<P>The Poor ble&s;&s;ed you every &s;tep you trod: The Rich thought you their honour, and took a pride, that they were not obliged to de&s;cend from their own cla&s;s, for an example that did credit to it.</P>
<P>Tho' all men wi&s;hed for you, and &s;ought you, young as you was, yet, had not tho&s;e, who were brought to addre&s;s you, been encouraged out of &s;or|did and &s;piteful views to attempt your pre&s;ence, not

<P>Thus happy in all about you, thus making happy all within your circle, could you think that nothing would happen to you, to convince you, that you were not to be exempted from the common lot?&mdash;To convince you, that you were not <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> per|fect; and that you mu&s;t not expect to pa&s;s thro' life, without trial, temptation, and misfortune?</P>
<P>Indeed, it mu&s;t be owned, that no trial, no tempta|tion, worthy of you, could have well attacked you &s;ooner, or more effectually, than tho&s;e heavy ones have done: For every common ca&s;e you were &s;upe|rior to: It mu&s;t be &s;ome man, or &s;ome wor&s;e &s;pirit in the &s;hape of one, that, formed on purpo&s;e, was to be &s;ent to invade you; while as many other &s;uch &s;pi|rits, as there are per&s;ons in your family, were permitted to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;everally, in one dark hour, of the heart of every one of it, there to &s;it perching, perhaps, and directing every motion to the motions of the &s;e|ducer without, in order to irritate, to provoke, to pu&s;h you forward to meet him.</P>
<P>So, upon the whole, there &s;eems, as I have often &s;aid, a kind of fate in your error, if an error; and this, perhaps, admitted, for the &s;ake of a better ex|ample to be collected from your <HI>&s;ufferings,</HI> than could have been given, had you <HI>never erred:</HI> For, my dear, ADVERSITY is your SHINING-TIME: I &s;ee evi|dently, that it mu&s;t call forth graces and beauties, that could not have been &s;een in a run of that pro|&s;perous fortune, which attended you from your cradle till now; admirably as you became, and, as we all thought, greatly as you de&s;erved, that pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>All the matter is, the trial mu&s;t be grievous to you: It is to <HI>me:</HI> It is to all who love you, and looked upon you as one &s;et aloft to be admired and imitated, and not as a mark, as you have lately found, for Envy to &s;hoot its &s;hafts at.</P>

<P>I Mu&s;t be &s;ilent, my exalted friend, under prai&s;es that oppre&s;s my heart with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of not de&s;erving them; at the &s;ame time, that the generous de&s;ign of tho&s;e prai&s;es rai&s;es and comforts it: For it is a charming thing to &s;tand high in the opinion of tho&s;e we love: And to find that there are &s;ouls that can carry their friend&s;hips beyond accidents, beyond body, and ties of blood. Whatever, my deare&s;t creature, is <HI>my</HI> &s;hining-time, the adver&s;ity of a friend is <HI>yours.</HI> And it would be almo&s;t a fault in me to regret tho&s;e afflictions, which give you an opportunity &s;o gloriou&s;ly to exert tho&s;e qualities, which not only ennoble our &s;ex, but dignify human nature.</P>
<P>But let me proceed to &s;ubjects le&s;s agreeable.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry you have rea&s;on to think Singleton's pro|jects are not at an end. But who knows what the &s;ailor had to propo&s;e?&mdash;Yet had any good been in|tended

me, this method would hardly have been fal|len upon.</P>
<P>Depend upon it, my dear, your letters &s;hall be &s;afe.</P>
<P>I have made a handle of Mr. Lovelace's bold attempt and freedom, as I told you I would, to keep him ever &s;ince at di&s;tance, that I may have an opportunity to &s;ee the &s;ucce&s;s of the application to my uncle, and to be at liberty to embrace any favourable overtures that may ari&s;e from it. Yet he has been very importunate, and twice brought Mr. Mennell from Mrs. Fretch|ville, to talk about the hou&s;e. If I &s;hould be obliged to make up with him again, I &s;hall think I am always doing my&s;elf a &s;pight.</P>
<P>As to what you mention of his newly-detected crimes; and your advice to attach Dorcas; and to come at &s;ome of his letters; the&s;e things will require more or le&s;s of my attention, as I may hope favour, or not, from my uncle Harlowe.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for poor Hannah's continued illne&s;s. Pray, my dear, inform your&s;elf, for me, whether &s;he wants any thing that befits her ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I will not clo&s;e this letter till to-morrow is over; for I am re&s;olved to go to church; and this as well for the &s;ake of my duty, as to &s;ee, if I am at liberty to go out when I plea&s;e, without being attended or accompanied.</P>

<P>I HAVE not been able to avoid a &s;hort debate with Mr. Lovelace. I had order'd a coach to the door. When I had notice that it was come, I went out of my chamber, to go to it; but met him dre&s;&s;ed on the &s;tairs head, with a book in his hand, but without his hat and &s;word.&mdash;He a&s;ked, with an air very &s;olemn, yet re&s;pectful, if I were going abroad. I told him! was. He de&s;ired leave to attend me, if I were going to church. I refu&s;ed him. And then he complained heavily of my treatment of him; and declared that he
<PB N="27" REF="34">
would not live &s;uch another week, as the pa&s;t, for the world.</P>
<P>I owned to him very frankly, that I had made an application to my friends; and that I was re&s;olved to keep my&s;elf to my&s;elf till I knew the i&s;&s;ue of it.</P>
<P>He coloured, and &s;eemed &s;urprized. But checking him&s;elf in &s;omething he was going to &s;ay, he pleaded my danger from Singleton, and again de&s;ired to at|tend me.</P>
<P>And then he told me, that Mrs. Fretchville had de&s;ired to continue a fortnight longer in the hou&s;e. She found, &s;aid he, that I was unable to determine about entering upon it; and now who knows when &s;uch a vapouri&s;h creature will come to a re&s;olution? This, Madam, has been an unhappy week; for had I not &s;tood upon &s;uch bad terms with you, you might have been now mi&s;tre&s;s of that hou&s;e; and probably had my cou&s;in Montague, if not my aunt Lawrance, actually with you.</P>
<P>And &s;o, Sir, taking all you &s;ay for granted, your cou&s;in Montague cannot come to Mrs. Sinclair's? What, pray, is her objection to Mrs. Sinclair's? Is this hou&s;e fit for me to live in a month or two, and not fit for any of your relations for a few days?&mdash;And Mrs. Fretchville has taken more time too&mdash;And &s;o, pu&s;hing by him, I hurried down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>He called to Dorcas to bring him his &s;word and hat; and following me down into the pa&s;&s;age, placed him|&s;elf between me and the door; and again be&s;ought me to permit him to attend me.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sinclair came out at that in&s;tant, and a&s;ked me, If I did not choo&s;e a di&s;h of chocolate?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, Mrs. Sinclair, &s;aid I, you would take this man in with you to your chocolate. I don't know whether I am at liberty to &s;tir out without his leave or not&mdash;Then turning to him, I asked, If he kept me there his pri&s;oner?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="35">Dorcas ju&s;t then bringing him his &s;word and hat, he opened the &s;treet-door, and taking my re&s;i&s;ting hand, led me, in a very ob&s;equious manner, to the coach. People pa&s;&s;ing by, &s;topt, &s;tared, and whi&s;|per'd&mdash;But he is &s;o graceful in his per&s;on and dre&s;s, that he generally takes every eye.</P>
<P>I was unea&s;y to be &s;o gaz'd at; and he &s;tepp'd in after me, and the coachman drove to St. Paul's.</P>
<P>He was very full of a&s;&s;iduities all the way; while I was as re&s;erv'd as po&s;&s;ible: And when I return'd, din'd, as I had done the greate&s;t part of the week, by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He told me, upon my re&s;olving to do &s;o, that altho' he would continue his pa&s;&s;ive ob&s;ervance, till I knew the i&s;&s;ue of my application; yet I mu&s;t expect, that then I &s;hould never re&s;t one moment till I had fixed his happy day: For that his very &s;oul was fretted with my &s;lights, re&s;entments, and delays.</P>
<P>A wretch! when I can &s;ay, to my infinite regret, on a <HI>double</HI> account, that all he complains of is owing to him&s;elf!</P>

<DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, May</HI> 11.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>CANNOT you, without naming <HI>me</HI> as an advi&s;er, who am hated by the family, contrive a way to let Mrs. Harlowe know, that in an accidental conver|&s;ation with me, you had been a&s;&s;ured, that my be|loved friend pines after a reconciliation with her rela|tions: That &s;he has hitherto, in hopes of it, refu&s;ed
<PB N="29" REF="36">
to enter into any obligations, that &s;hall be in the lea&s;t an hindrance to it: That &s;he would fain avoid giving Mr. Lovelace a right to make her family unea&s;y, in relation to her grandfather's e&s;tate: That all &s;he wi&s;hes for &s;till, is to be indulged in her choice of a &s;ingle life, and, on that condition, would make her father's plea&s;ure hers with regard to that e&s;tate: That Mr. Lovelace is continually pre&s;&s;ing her to marry him; and all his friends likewi&s;e: But that I am &s;ure, &s;he has &s;o little liking to the man, becau&s;e of his faulty morals, and of her relations antipathy to him, that if &s;he had any hope given her of a reconciliation, &s;he would forego all thoughts of him, and put her&s;elf into her father's protection. But that their re&s;olution mu&s;t be &s;peedy; for otherwi&s;e &s;he would find her&s;elf ob|liged to give way to his pre&s;&s;ing intreaties; and it might then be out of her power to prevent di&s;agree|able litigations.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, Mrs. Norton, upon my honour, that our deare&s;t friend knows nothing of this proce|dure of mine: And therefore it is proper to acquaint you, in confidence, with my grounds for it.&mdash;The&s;e are they:&mdash;</P>
<P>She had de&s;ired me to let Mr. Hickman drop hints to the above effect to her uncle Harlowe; but indi|rectly as from <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> le&s;t, if the application &s;hould not be attended with &s;ucce&s;s; and Mr. Lovelace (who already takes it ill, that he has &s;o little of her favour) come to know it, &s;he may be deprived of every protection, and be perhaps &s;ubjected to great inconveniences from &s;o haughty a &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Having this authority from her; and being very &s;ollicitous about the &s;ucce&s;s of the application, I thought, that if the weight of &s;o good a wife, mother, and &s;i&s;ter, as Mrs. Harlowe is known to be, were thrown into the &s;ame &s;cale, with that of Mr. John Harlowe (&s;uppo&s;ing he <HI>could</HI> be engaged) it could hardly fail of making a due impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="37">Mr. Hickman will &s;ee Mr. Harlowe to-morrow: By that time you may &s;ee Mrs. Harlowe. If Mr. Hickman finds the old gentleman favourable, he will tell him, that you will have &s;een Mrs. Harlowe upon the &s;ame account; and will advi&s;e him to join in con|&s;ultation with her how be&s;t to proceed to melt the mo&s;t obdurate hearts in the world.</P>
<P>This is the fair &s;tate of the matter, and my true motive for writing to you. I leave all therefore to your di&s;cretion: And mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to it; being of opinion that Mr. Lovelace cannot po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve our admirable friend: Nor, indeed, know I the man who can.</P>

<P>[Not communicated till the hi&s;tory came to be compiled.]</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Return an an&s;wer in writing, as I promi&s;ed, to your communication. But take no notice, that I do write, either to my Bella's Betty, who I under|&s;tand, &s;ometimes vi&s;its you, or to the poor wretch her&s;elf; nor to any-body. I charge you don't. My heart is full. Writing may give &s;ome vent to my griefs, and perhaps I may write what lies mo&s;t upon my heart, without confining my&s;elf &s;trictly to the pre|&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>You know how dear this ingrateful creature ever was to us all. You know how &s;incerely we joined with every one of tho&s;e who ever had &s;een her, or con|ver&s;ed with her, to prai&s;e and admire her; and ex|ceeded in our prai&s;e even the bounds of that mode&s;ty, which, becau&s;e &s;he was our own, &s;hould have re|&s;trained us; being of opinion, that to have been &s;ilent in the prai&s;e of &s;o apparent a merit, mu&s;t rather have argued blindne&s;s or affectation in us, than that we &s;hould incur the cen&s;ure of vain partiality to our own.</P>
<P>When therefore any-body congratulated us on &s;uch a daughter, we received their congratulations without any diminution. If it was &s;aid, You are happy in this child, we owned, that no parents ever were hap|pier <HI>in</HI> a child. If more particularly, they prai&s;ed her dutiful behaviour to us, we &s;aid, She knew not how to offend. If it was &s;aid, Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe has
<PB N="33" REF="40">
a wit and penetration beyond her years; we, in&s;tead of di&s;allowing it, would add,&mdash;And a judgment no le&s;s extraordinary than her wit. If her prudence was prai&s;ed, and a forethought, which every one &s;aw &s;up|ply'd what only years and experience gave to others; Nobody need to &s;cruple taking le&s;&s;ons from Mi&s;s Cla|ri&s;&s;a Harlowe, was our proud an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Forgive me, O forgive me, my dear Norton&mdash;But I know you will&mdash;For yours, when good, was this child, and your glory as well as mine!</P>
<P>But have you not heard &s;trangers, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed to and from church, &s;top to prai&s;e the angel of a crea|ture, as they called her; when it was enough for tho&s;e who knew who &s;he was, to cry, <HI>Why, it is Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!</HI>&mdash;As if every-body were obliged to know, or to have heard of Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, and of her excellencies. While, accu&s;tom'd to prai&s;e, it was too familiar to her, to cau&s;e her to alter either her look or her pace.</P>
<P>For my own part, I could not &s;tifle a plea&s;ure, that had perhaps a faulty vanity for its foundation, when|ever I was &s;poken of, or addre&s;&s;ed to, as the mother of &s;o &s;weet a child: Mr. Harlowe and I, all the time, loving each other the better for the &s;hare each had in &s;uch a daughter.</P>
<P>Still, &s;till, indulge the fond, the overflowing heart of a mother! I could dwell for ever upon the remem|brance of what &s;he <HI>was,</HI> would but that remem|brance bani&s;h from my mind what &s;he <HI>is!</HI></P>
<P>In her bo&s;om, young as &s;he was, could I repo&s;e all my griefs&mdash;Sure of receiving from <HI>her</HI> prudence, ad|vice as well as comfort: And both in&s;inuated in &s;o humble, in &s;o dutiful a manner, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible to take tho&s;e exceptions which the di&s;tance of years and character between a mother and a daughter, would, from any other daughter, have made one appre|hen&s;ive of. She was our glory when abroad, our de|light when at home. Every-body was even covetous
<PB N="34" REF="41">
of her company; and we grudg'd her to our brothers Harlowe, and to our &s;i&s;ter and brother Hervey.&mdash;No other contention among us, then, but who &s;hould be favoured by her next.&mdash;No chiding ever knew &s;he from us, but the chiding of lovers, when &s;he was for &s;hut|ting her&s;elf up too long together from us, in pur&s;uit of tho&s;e charming amu&s;ements, and u&s;eful employ|ments, which, however, the whole family was the better for.</P>
<P>Our other children had rea&s;on, good children as they always were, to think them&s;elves neglected. But they likewi&s;e were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their &s;i&s;ter's &s;u|periority, and of the honour &s;he reflected upon the whole family, that they confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves eclip&s;ed, without envying the eclip&s;er. Indeed there was not any-body &s;o equal with her, in their own opinions, as to envy what all a&s;pired but to emulate.&mdash;The dear creature, you know, my Norton, gave an eminence to us all: And now, that &s;he has left us, &s;o di&s;grace|fully left us! we are &s;tript of our ornament, and are but a common family!</P>
<P>Then her acquirements. Her &s;kill in mu&s;ic, her fine needleworks, her elegance in dre&s;s; for which &s;he was &s;o much admired, that the neighbouring ladies u&s;ed to &s;ay, that they need not fetch fa&s;hions from London; &s;ince whatever Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe wore, was the <HI>be&s;t</HI> fa&s;hion, becau&s;e her choice of <HI>natural</HI> beauties &s;et tho&s;e of <HI>art</HI> far behind them. Her genteel ea&s;e, and fine turn of per&s;on; her deep reading; and the&s;e, joined to her open manners, and her chearful mode&s;ty&mdash;O my good Norton, what a &s;weet child was <HI>once</HI> my Clary Harlowe!</P>
<P>This, and more, <HI>you</HI> knew her to be: For many of her excellencies were owing to your&s;elf; and with the milk you gave her, you gave her what no other nur&s;e in the world could give her.</P>
<P>And do you think, my worthy woman, do you think, that the wilful lap&s;e of &s;uch a child is to be
<PB N="35" REF="42">
forgiven? Can &s;he her&s;elf think, that &s;he de&s;erves not the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment for the abu&s;e of &s;uch ta|lents as were intru&s;ted to her?</P>
<P>Her fault was a fault of premeditation, of cunning, of contrivance. She has deceived every-body's ex|pectations. Her whole &s;ex, as well as the family &s;he &s;prung from, is di&s;graced by it.</P>
<P>Would any-body ever have believed, that &s;uch a young creature as this, who had by her advice &s;aved even her over-lively friend from marrying a fop, and a libertine, would her&s;elf have gone off with one of the vile&s;t and mo&s;t notorious of libertines? A man who&s;e character &s;he knew; and knew to be wor&s;e than his &s;he &s;aved her friend from; who&s;e vices &s;he was warned of: One who had had her brother's life in his hands; and who con&s;tantly &s;et our whole fa|mily at defiance.</P>
<P>Think for me, my good Norton; think what my unhappine&s;s mu&s;t be, both as a wife and a mother. What re&s;tle&s;s days, what &s;leeple&s;s nights; yet my own rankling angui&s;h endeavoured to be &s;moothed over, to &s;often the angui&s;h of fiercer &s;pirits, and to keep them from blazing out to further mi&s;chief. O this naughty, naughty girl! who <HI>knew</HI> &s;o well what &s;he did; and who could look &s;o far into con&s;equences, that we thought &s;he would have dy'd, rather than have done as &s;he has done!</P>
<P>Her known character for prudence leaves no plea for excu&s;e. How then can I offer to plead for her, if, thro' motherly indulgence, I would forgive her my&s;elf?&mdash;And have we not, moreover, &s;uffer'd all the di&s;grace that can befal us? Has not &s;he?</P>
<P>If <HI>now,</HI> &s;he has &s;o little liking to his morals, had &s;he not rea&s;on <HI>before</HI> to have <HI>as</HI> little? Or has &s;he &s;uf|fered by them in her own per&s;on?&mdash;O my good wo|man, I doubt&mdash;I doubt&mdash;Will not the character of the man make one doubt an angel, if once in his power? The world will think the wor&s;t. I am told
<PB N="36" REF="43">
it <HI>does.</HI> So likewi&s;e her father fears; her brother hears; and what can I do?</P>
<P>Our <HI>antipathy</HI> to him &s;he knew before, as well as his character. The&s;e therefore cannot be new mo|tives without a new rea&s;on.&mdash;O my dear Mrs. Nor|ton, how &s;hall <HI>I,</HI> how can <HI>you,</HI> &s;upport our&s;elves un|der the apprehen&s;ions that the&s;e thoughts lead to, of my Clary Harlowe, and your Clary Harlowe!</P>
<P><HI>He continually pre&s;&s;ing her,</HI> you &s;ay, <HI>to marry him. His friends likewi&s;e.</HI> She has rea&s;on, no doubt &s;he has rea&s;on, for this application to us: And her crime is glo&s;s'd over, to bring her to us with new di&s;grace!&mdash;Whither, whither, does one guilty &s;tep lead the mi&s;guided heart!&mdash;And now truly, to &s;ave a &s;tubborn &s;pirit, we are only to be <HI>&s;ounded,</HI> that the application may be retracted or deny'd!</P>
<P>Upon the whole: Were I inclined to plead for her, it is <HI>now</HI> the mo&s;t improper of all times. <HI>Now</HI> that my brother Harlowe has di&s;couraged (as he la&s;t night came hither on purpo&s;e to tell us) Mr. Hick|man's in&s;inuated application; and been applauded for it. <HI>Now,</HI> that my brother Antony is intending to carry his great fortune, thro' her fault, into another family:&mdash;She expecting, no doubt, her&s;elf, to be put into her grandfather's e&s;tate, in con&s;equence of a re|conciliation, and as a reward for her fault: And in&s;i&s;t|ing &s;till upon terms, that &s;he offer'd before, and were rejected.&mdash;Not thro' my fault, I am &s;ure, rejected.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e things, you will return &s;uch an an|&s;wer as the ca&s;e requires.&mdash;It might co&s;t me the peace of my whole life, at this time, to move for her. God forgive her!&mdash;If I do, nobody el&s;e will. And let it be for your own &s;ake, as well as mine, a &s;ecret that you and I have enter'd upon this &s;ubject. And I de|&s;ire you not to touch upon it again but by particular permi&s;&s;ion: For, O my dear good woman, it &s;ets my heart a-bleeding in as many &s;treams as there are veins in it!</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="44">Yet think me not impenetrable by a proper con|trition and remor&s;e! But what a torment is it to have a will without a power!</P>
<P>Adieu! adieu! God give us both comfort; and to the once dear&mdash;the ever-dear creature (for can a mo|ther forget her child?), repentance, deep repentance! And as little &s;uffering as may befit his ble&s;&s;ed will, and her grievous fault, prays</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW it is now, my dear, between you and Mr. Lovelace, I cannot tell. But wicked as the man is, I am afraid he mu&s;t be your lord and ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I called him by &s;everal very hard names in my la&s;t. I had but ju&s;t heard &s;ome of his vilene&s;&s;es, when I &s;at down to write; &s;o my indignation was rai&s;ed. But on inquiry, and recollection, I find that the facts laid to his charge were all of them committed &s;ome time ago; not &s;ince he has had <HI>&s;trong</HI> hopes of your fa|vour. This is &s;aying &s;omething for him. His gene|rous behaviour to the innkeeper's daughter, is a more recent in&s;tance to his credit; to &s;ay nothing of the univer&s;al good character he has as a kind landlord. And then I approve much of the motion he made to put you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mrs. Fretchville's hou&s;e, while he continues at the other widow's, till you agree that one hou&s;e &s;hall hold you. I wi&s;h this was done. Be &s;ure you embrace this offer, if you do not &s;oon meet at the altar, and get one of his cou&s;ins with you.</P>
<P>Were you once marry'd, I &s;hould think you can|not be <HI>very</HI> unhappy, tho' you n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not be &s;o happy with him as you de&s;erve to be. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;take he has in
<PB N="38" REF="45">
his country, and his rever&s;ions: The care he takes of his affairs; his freedom from obligation; nay, his pride, with your merit, mu&s;t be a tolerable &s;ecurity for you, I &s;hould think. Tho' particulars of his wickedne&s;s, as they come to my knowlege, hurt and incen&s;e me; yet, after all, when I give my&s;elf time to reflect, all that I have heard of him, to his di&s;advan|tage, was comprehended in the general character given of him long ago, by his uncle's and his own di&s;mi&s;s'd bailiff <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> I. <HI>p.</HI> 22.</NOTE>, and which was confirm'd to you by Mrs. Greme <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> III. <HI>p.</HI> 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>You can have nothing therefore, I think, to be deeply concerned about, but his future good, and the bad example he may hereafter &s;et to his own family. The&s;e indeed are very ju&s;t concerns: But were you to <HI>leave</HI> him now, either <HI>with</HI> or <HI>without</HI> his con&s;ent, his fortune and alliances &s;o con&s;iderable, his per&s;on and addre&s;s &s;o engaging (every-one excu&s;ing you now on tho&s;e accounts, and becau&s;e of your relations fol|lies), it would have a very ill appearance for your reputation. I cannot therefore, on the mo&s;t delibe|rate con&s;ideration, advi&s;e you to think of that, while you have no rea&s;on to doubt his honour. May eternal vengeance pur&s;ue the villain, if he gives room for an apprehen&s;ion of this nature!</P>
<P>Yet his teazing ways are intolerable: His ac|quie&s;cence with your &s;light delays, and his re&s;igned|ne&s;s to the di&s;tance you now keep him at (for a fault &s;o much &s;lighter, as he mu&s;t think, than the puni&s;h|ment), are unaccountable: He doubts your love of <HI>him,</HI> that is very probable; but you have rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed at <HI>his</HI> want of ardour; a ble&s;&s;ing &s;o great, within his <HI>reach,</HI> as I may &s;ay.</P>
<P>By the time you have read to this place, you will have no doubt of what has been the i&s;&s;ue of the con|ference between the <HI>Two Gentlemen.</HI> I am equally &s;hock'd, and enraged again&s;t them All: Again&s;t them
<PB N="39" REF="46">
<HI>All,</HI> I &s;ay; for I have try'd your good Norton's weight with your mother, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as the gentleman &s;ounded your uncle.&mdash;Never were there &s;uch determin'd brutes in the world! Why &s;hould I mince the matter? Yet would I fain, methinks, make an exception for your mother.</P>
<P>Your uncle will have it, that you are ruin'd.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He can believe every-thing bad of a creature, who could run away with a man&mdash;With &s;uch a one e&s;pecially as Lovelace. They all <HI>expected</HI> applications from you, when &s;ome heavy di&s;tre&s;s had fallen upon you.&mdash;But they were all re&s;olved not to &s;tir an inch in your favour; no, not to &s;ave your life!'</Q></P>
<P>My deare&s;t &s;oul! re&s;olve to a&s;&s;ert your right. Claim your own, and go and live upon it, as you ought. Then, if you marry not, how will the wretches creep to you, for your rever&s;ionary di&s;po&s;itions!</P>
<P>You were accu&s;ed (as in your aunt's letter)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'of premeditation and contrivance in your e&s;cape.'</Q>
In|&s;tead of pitying <HI>you,</HI> the mediating per&s;on was called upon
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'to pity <HI>them</HI>; who once, he &s;aid, doted upon you: Who took no joy but in your pre&s;ence: Who devour'd your words as you &s;poke them: Who trod over again your foot&s;teps, as you walked before them.'</Q>
&mdash;And I know not what of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is now evident to me, and &s;o it mu&s;t be to you, when you read this letter, that you have but one choice. And the &s;ooner you make it the better.&mdash;Shall we &s;uppo&s;e that it is not in your power to make it?&mdash;I cannot have patience to &s;up|po&s;e that.</P>
<P>I am concern'd, methinks, to know how you will do to conde&s;cend, now you &s;ee you mu&s;t be his, after you have kept him at &s;uch a di&s;tance; and for the revenge his pride may put him upon taking for it. But let me tell you, that if my going up, and &s;hare|ing fortunes with you, will prevent &s;uch a noble crea|ture from &s;tooping too low; much more, were it
<PB N="40" REF="47">
likely to prevent your ruin, I would not he&s;itate a mo|ment about it. What's the whole world to me, weigh'd again&s;t &s;uch a friend&s;hip as ours?&mdash;Think you, that any of the enjoyments of this life, could be enjoyments to me, were &s;uch a friend as you to be involved in calamities, which I could either relieve her from, or alleviate, by giving them up? And what in &s;aying this, and acting up to it, do I offer you, but the fruits of a friend&s;hip your worth has created?</P>
<P>Excu&s;e my warmth of expre&s;&s;ion. The warmth of my heart wants none. I am enraged at your re|lations; for, bad as what I have mentioned is, I have not told you all; nor now, perhaps, ever will:&mdash;I am angry at my own mother's narrowne&s;s of mind, and adherence to old notions indi&s;criminately&mdash;And I am exa&s;perated again&s;t your fooli&s;h, your low-va|nity'd Lovelace!&mdash;But let us &s;toop to take the wretch as he is, and make the be&s;t of him, &s;ince you are de&s;tin'd to &s;toop, to keep grovelers and worldlings in countenance. He has not been guilty of direct in|decency to you. Nor <HI>dare</HI> he. Not &s;o much of a devil as that comes to neither!&mdash;Had he &s;uch villain|ous intentions, &s;o much in his power as you are, they would have &s;hewn them&s;elves before now to &s;uch a penetrating and vigilant eye, and to &s;uch a pure heart as yours. Let us &s;ave the wretch then, if we can, tho' we &s;oil our fingers in lifting him up from his dirt.</P>
<P>There is yet, to a per&s;on of your fortune and in|dependence, a good deal to do, if you enter upon tho&s;e terms, which <HI>ought</HI> to be enter'd upon. I don't find, that he has once talked of &s;ettlements; much le&s;s of the licence. It is hard! But as your evil de|&s;tiny has thrown you out of all other protection and medi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, you mu&s;t be father, mother, uncle to your&s;elf, and enter upon the requi&s;ite points for your|&s;elf. Indeed you mu&s;t. Your &s;ituation requires it. What room for delicacy now? Or would you have
<PB N="41" REF="48">
<HI>me</HI> write to the wretch? Yet that would be the &s;ame thing, as if you were to write your&s;elf. Yet write you &s;hould, I think, if you cannot &s;peak. But &s;peaking is certainly be&s;t: For words leave no traces; they pa&s;s as breath; and mingle with air; and may be explained with latitude. But the pen is a witne&s;s on record.</P>
<P>I know the gentlene&s;s of your &s;pirit; I know the laudable pride of your heart; and the ju&s;t notion you have of the dignity of our &s;ex, in the&s;e delicate points. But once more, all this is nothing now: Your honour is concerned, that the dignity I &s;peak of, &s;hould not be &s;tood upon.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Mr. Lovelace,' would I &s;ay; yet hate the fooli&s;h fellow, for his low, his &s;tupid pride, in wi&s;hing to triumph over the dignity of his own wife;&mdash;

In what light am I to look upon <HI>you?</HI> I have well con&s;ider'd of every thing: You have made &s;ome people, much again&s;t my liking, think me a <HI>wife:</HI> Others know I am <HI>not</HI> married; nor do I de&s;ire any body &s;hould believe I <HI>am.</HI> Do you think your being here in the &s;ame hou&s;e with me, can be to my reputation? You talk to me of Mrs. Fretchville's hou&s;e&mdash;"
[This will bring him to re|new his la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e on that &s;ubject, if he does not revive it of him&s;elf.]
'If Mrs. Fretchville knows not her own mind, what is her hou&s;e to me?

<P>Such a declaration mu&s;t bring all forward. There are twenty ways, my dear, that you would find out to advi&s;e another how to act in your circum&s;tances. He will di&s;dain, from his native in&s;olence, to have it thought he

has <HI>any-body</HI> to con&s;ult. Well then, will he not be obliged to declare him&s;elf? And if he <HI>does,</HI> no delays on your &s;ide, I be&s;eech you. Give him the day: Let it be a &s;hort one. It would be derogating from your own merit, and <HI>honour</HI> too, let me tell you, even altho' he &s;hould <HI>not</HI> be &s;o explicit as he ought to be, to &s;eem but to doubt his meaning; and to wait for that explanation which I &s;hould for ever de&s;pi&s;e him for, if he makes nece&s;&s;ary.

And there's an end of the matter.</P>
<P>This is <HI>my</HI> advice: Mend it, as circum&s;tances offer, and follow <HI>your own.</HI> But indeed, my dear, this, or &s;omething like it, would I do. As witne&s;s</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<HEAD>Inclo&s;ed in the above.</HEAD>
<P>I Mu&s;t trouble you with my concerns, tho' your own are &s;o heavy upon you.&mdash;A piece of news I have to tell you. Your uncle Antony is di&s;po&s;ed to marry.&mdash;With whom, think you?&mdash;With my mamma. True indeed. Your family know it. All is laid with redoubled malice at your door. And there the <HI>old &s;oul</HI> him&s;elf lays it.</P>
<P>Take no notice of this intelligence, not &s;o much as in your letters to me, for fear of accidents.</P>
<P>I think it can't do. But were I to provoke my mother, that might afford a pretence. El&s;e, I &s;hould have been with you before now, I fancy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t likelihood that appears to me of encou|ragement, I di&s;mi&s;s Hickman, that's certain. If my mother di&s;oblige me in &s;o important an article, I &s;han't think of obliging her in &s;uch another. It is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;urely, that the de&s;ire of popping me off to that hone&s;t man can be with &s;uch a view.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="50">I repeat, that it cannot come to any thing. But the&s;e <HI>widows</HI>&mdash;Then &s;uch a love in us all, both old and young, of being courted and admired!&mdash;And &s;o irre|&s;i&s;tible to their <HI>elder&s;hips</HI> to be flatter'd, that all power is not over with them; but that they may &s;till cla&s;s and prank it with their daughters.

The me|mory of the father of that daughter not precious enough to weigh!&mdash;But let him advance if he dare&mdash;Let her encourage&mdash;But I hope &s;he won't.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, my dear. I am nettled. They have fearfully rumpled my gorget. You'll think me faulty. So I won't put my name to this &s;eparate paper. Other hands may re&s;emble mine. You did not &s;ee me write it.</P>

<P>NOW indeed, is it evident, my be&s;t, my only friend, that I have but one choice to make. And now do I find, that I have carried my re&s;ent|ment again&s;t this man too far; &s;ince now I am to ap|pear as if under an obligation to his patience with me for a conduct, that, perhaps, he will think, if not humour&s;ome and childi&s;h, plainly demon&s;trative of my little e&s;teem of him; of but a &s;econdary e&s;teem at lea&s;t, where before, his pride, rather than
<PB N="44" REF="51">
his merit, had made him expect a <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> O my dear!&mdash;to be under obligation to, and to be ca&s;t upon a man, that is not a <HI>generous</HI> man!&mdash;That is, indeed, a <HI>cruel</HI> man!&mdash;That is capable of creating a di&s;tre&s;s to a young creature, who by her evil de&s;tiny, is thrown into his power; and then of <HI>enjoying</HI> it, as I may &s;ay! [I verily think I may &s;ay &s;o, of this &s;a|vage!]&mdash;What a fate is mine!</P>
<P>You give me, my dear, good advice, as to the per|emptory manner in which I ought to treat him: But do you con&s;ider to whom it is that you give that advice?</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion for it &s;hould never have been given by <HI>me,</HI> of all creatures; for I am unequal, utterly unequal to it!&mdash;What, <HI>I,</HI> to challenge a man for a hu&s;band!&mdash;<HI>I,</HI> to exert my&s;elf to quicken the delayer in his re&s;olutions! And, having lo&s;t an opportunity, to begin to try to recal it, as <HI>from my&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>for my&s;elf!</HI>&mdash;To <HI>threaten</HI> him, as I may &s;ay, into the marriage-&s;tate!&mdash;O my dear! if this be right to be done, how difficult is it, where Mode&s;ty and Self (or where Pride, if you plea&s;e) is concerned to do that right? Or, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in your words, to be father, mother, uncle, to my&s;elf!&mdash;E&s;pecially where one thinks a triumph over one is intended.&mdash;Do, my dear, advi&s;e me, per&s;uade me, to renounce the man for ever: And then I will for ever renounce him!</P>
<P>You &s;ay, you have tried Mrs. Norton's weight with my mamma.&mdash;Bad as the returns are which my appli|cation by Mr. Hickman has met with, you tell me, you have not acquainted me with all the bad; nor now, perhaps, ever will. But why &s;o, my dear? What <HI>is</HI> the bad, what <HI>can</HI> be the bad, which now you will never tell me of?&mdash;What wor&s;e, than renounce me! and for ever!
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'My uncle, you &s;ay, believes me ru|in'd: He declares, that he can believe every thing bad of a creature, who could run away with a man:
<PB N="45" REF="52">
And they have all made a re&s;olution, not to &s;tir an inch in my favour; no, not to &s;ave my life."</Q></P>
<P>Have you wor&s;e than this, my dear, behind?&mdash;Surely my father has not renewed his dreadful male|diction!&mdash;Surely, if &s;o, my mamma has not joined in it! Have my uncles given it their &s;anction, and made it a family act! What, my dear, is the wor&s;t, that you will leave for ever unrevealed?</P>
<P>O Lovelace! why come&s;t thou not ju&s;t now; while the&s;e black pro&s;pects are before me? For now, could&s;t thou look into my heart, would&s;t thou &s;ee a di&s;tre&s;s worthy of thy barbarous triumph!</P>
<P>I WAS forced to quit my pen.</P>
<P>And you &s;ay you have try'd Mrs. Norton's weight with my mamma?</P>
<P>What <HI>is</HI> done, cannot be help'd: But I wi&s;h you had not taken any &s;tep, in a matter &s;o very concerning to me, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting me.&mdash;Forgive me, my dear;&mdash;but that high-&s;oul'd and noble friend&s;hip, which you avow with &s;o obliging, and &s;o uncommon a warmth, at the &s;ame time, that it is the &s;ubject of my grateful admiration, is no le&s;s, becau&s;e of its fer|vor, the ground of my apprehen&s;ion!</P>
<P>Well, but now, to look forward, you are of opi|nion, that I mu&s;t be his: And that I cannot leave him with reputation to my&s;elf, whether with or without his con&s;ent. I mu&s;t, if &s;o, make the be&s;t of the bad matter.</P>
<P>He went out in the morning; intending not to re|turn to dinner, unle&s;s (as he &s;ent me word) I would admit him to dine with me.</P>
<P>I excu&s;ed my&s;elf. The man, who&s;e anger is now to be of &s;uch high importance to me, was, it &s;eems, di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>As he, as well as I, expected, that I &s;hould receive a letter from you this day, by Collins, I &s;uppo&s;e he will not be long before he returns; and then, po&s;|&s;ibly,
<PB N="46" REF="53">
he is to be mighty &s;tately, mighty <HI>manni&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> mighty <HI>coy,</HI> if you plea&s;e!

Well then, I'll try, if I can be &s;till meeker, &s;hall I!&mdash;O my dear!&mdash;</P>
<P>But let me &s;it with my hands before me, all pa|tience, all re&s;ignation; for I think I hear him coming up.&mdash;Or &s;hall I roundly acco&s;t him, in the words, in the form, you, my dear, have pre&s;crib'd?</P>

<P>THE contents of your letter, and my own heavy reflections, render'd me incapable of &s;eeing this ex|pecting man!&mdash;The fir&s;t word he a&s;ked Dorcas, was, If I had received a letter &s;ince he had been out?&mdash;She told me this; and her an&s;wer, That I had; and was fa&s;ting, and had been in tears ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>He &s;ent to de&s;ire an interview with me.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd by her, That I was not very well. In the morning, if better, I would &s;ee him as &s;oon as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Very humble! was it not, my dear?&mdash;Yet he was too royal to take it for humility; for Dorcas told me, he rubb'd one &s;ide of his face imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tiently; and &s;aid a ra&s;h word, and was out of humour; &s;talking about the room.</P>
<P>Half an hour after, he &s;ent again; de&s;iring very earne&s;tly, that I would admit him to &s;upper with me. He would enter upon no &s;ubjects of conver&s;a|tion, but what I &s;hould lead to.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="54">So I &s;hould have been at <HI>liberty,</HI> you &s;ee, to <HI>court him!</HI></P>
<P>I again de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, my eyes were &s;welled: I was very low-&s;pirited; and could not think of entering all at once, after &s;everal days di&s;tance, into the free|dom of conver&s;ation, which my friends utter rejection of me, as well as your opinion, have made nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>He &s;ent up to tell me, that as he heard I was fa&s;t|ing, if I would promi&s;e to eat &s;ome chicken which Mrs. Sinclair had order'd for &s;upper, he would ac|quie&s;ce.&mdash;Very kind in his anger!&mdash;Is he not?</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed him. Can I be more <HI>preparatively</HI> con|de&s;cending?&mdash;How happy, I'll warrant you, if I may meet him in a kind and forgiving humour!</P>
<P>I hate my&s;elf!&mdash;But I won't be in&s;ulted. Indeed I won't! for all this.</P>

<P>I Think once more, we &s;eem to be in a kind of train; but through a &s;torm. I will give you the particulars.</P>
<P>I heard him in the dining-room at five in the morn|ing. I had re&s;ted very ill, and was up too: But opened not my door till &s;ix: When Dorcas brought me his reque&s;t for my company.</P>
<P>He approached me, and taking my hand, as I en|ter'd the dining-room, I went not to bed, Madam, till two, yet &s;lept not a wink. For God's &s;ake, torment me not, as you have done for a week pa&s;t.</P>
<P>He paus'd. I was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, proceeded he, I thought your re&s;entment of a mere unavailing curio&s;ity could not be deep;
<PB N="48" REF="55">
and that it would go off of it&s;elf: But when I found, it was to be kept up till you knew the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;ome new overtures which you had made, and which com|ply'd with, might have deprived me of you for ever; how, Madam, could I &s;upport my&s;elf under the thoughts of having, with &s;uch an union of intere&s;ts, made &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion upon your mind in my fa|vour?</P>
<P>He paus'd again. I was &s;till &s;ilent. He went on.</P>
<P>I acknowlege that I have a proud heart, Madam. I cannot but hope for &s;ome in&s;tance of previous and preferable favour from the lady I am ambitious to call mine; and that her choice of me &s;hould not appear, not <HI>flagrantly</HI> appear, directed by the perver&s;ene&s;s of her &s;elfi&s;h per&s;ecutors, and my irreconcileable ene|mies.</P>
<P>More to the &s;ame purpo&s;e he &s;aid: You know, my dear, the room he had given me to recriminate upon him, in twenty in&s;tances: I did not &s;pare him: But I need not repeat tho&s;e in&s;tances to you. Every one of the&s;e in&s;tances, I told him, convinced me of his <HI>pride,</HI> indeed, but not of his <HI>merit.</HI> I confe&s;&s;ed, that I had as much pride as him&s;elf; altho' I hoped it was of another kind, than that he &s;o readily avowed. But that if he had the lea&s;t mixture in <HI>his</HI> of the true pride (a pride worthy of his birth, of his family, and of his fortune), he &s;hould rather wi&s;h, I would pre|&s;ume to &s;ay, to promote <HI>mine,</HI> than either to &s;uppre&s;s, or to regret that I had it: That <HI>hence</HI> it was, that I thought it beneath me to di&s;own what had been my motives for declining, for &s;ome days pa&s;t, any conver|&s;ation with him, or vi&s;it from Mr. Mennell, that might lead to points out of my power to determine upon, until I heard from my uncle Harlowe; whom, I confe&s;&s;ed, I had cau&s;ed to be &s;ounded, whether<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> might be favoured with his intere&s;t, to obtain for me a reconciliation with my friends, upon terms which I had cau&s;ed to be propo&s;ed to him.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="56">He knew not, he &s;aid, and &s;uppo&s;ed mu&s;t not pre|&s;ume to a&s;k, what the&s;e terms were. But he could but too well gue&s;s at them; and that he was to have been the preliminary &s;acrifice. But I mu&s;t allow him to &s;ay, That as much as he admired the noblene&s;s of my &s;entiments in general, and in particular that <HI>true</HI> pride in me, which I had &s;poken of; he wi&s;h'd, that he could compliment me with &s;uch an uniformity in it, as &s;hould have &s;et me as much above all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to minds implacable and unrea&s;onable (he hoped he might, without offence, &s;ay that my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's were &s;uch), as it had above all favour and conde&s;cen&s;ion to him.</P>
<P><HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>nature,</HI> Sir, call upon me to make the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions you &s;peak of: There is a father, there is a mother, there are uncles, in the one ca&s;e, to ju&s;tify and demand tho&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions&mdash;What, pray, Sir, can be pleaded for the <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> as you call it?&mdash;Will you &s;ay, your merits, either with regard to <HI>them,</HI> or to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> may?</P>
<P>This to be &s;aid, after the per&s;ecution of tho&s;e re|lations! After what you have &s;uffer'd! After what you have made me hope! Let me a&s;k you, Madam (we talk'd of <HI>pride</HI> ju&s;t now), What &s;ort of pride mu&s;t <HI>his</HI> be, which could di&s;pen&s;e with inclination and preference in his lady's part of it?&mdash;What mu&s;t be that love&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> Sir! who talks of <HI>love?</HI>&mdash;Was not <HI>merit</HI> the thing we were talking of?&mdash;Have <HI>I</HI> ever profe&s;&s;ed; have <HI>I</HI> ever required of <HI>you</HI> profe&s;&s;ions of a pa&s;&s;ion of that nature? But there is no end of the&s;e debatings; each <HI>&s;o</HI> faultle&s;s, each <HI>&s;o</HI> full of &s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>I do not think my&s;elf <HI>faultle&s;s,</HI> Madam:&mdash;But&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>But</HI> what, Sir!&mdash;Would you evermore argue with me, as if you were a child?&mdash;Seeking palliations, and making promi&s;es?&mdash;Promi&s;es of what, Sir? Of being in future the man it is a &s;hame a gentleman is not?&mdash;Of being the man&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="57">Good God! interrupted he, with eyes lifted up, if <HI>thou</HI> wert to be thus &s;evere&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, well, Sir, impatiently&mdash;I need only to ob|&s;erve, that all this va&s;t difference in &s;entiments &s;hews how unpair'd our minds are&mdash;So let us&mdash;</P>

<P>Why, Sir, let us re&s;olve to quit every regard for each other&mdash;[Nay, flame not out&mdash;I am a poor weak-minded creature in &s;ome things: But where what I <HI>&s;hould be,</HI> or not de&s;erve to live, if I <HI>am not,</HI> is in the que&s;tion, I have great and invincible &s;pirit, or my own conceit betrays me].&mdash;Let us re&s;olve to quit every regard for each other that is more than civil. <HI>This</HI> you may depend upon; you may, if it will fewel your pride, gratify it with this a&s;&s;urance; That I will never marry any other man. I have &s;een enough of your &s;ex; at lea&s;t of <HI>you.</HI>&mdash;A &s;ingle life &s;hall ever be <HI>my</HI> choice&mdash;While I will leave you at liberty to pur&s;ue <HI>your own.</HI></P>
<P>Indifference, wor&s;e than indifference! &s;aid he, in a pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;</P>
<P>Interrupting him&mdash;Indifference let it be&mdash;You have not, in <HI>my</HI> opinion, at lea&s;t, de&s;erved it &s;hould be other: If you have in <HI>your own,</HI> you have cau&s;e, at lea&s;t your <HI>pride</HI> has, to hate me for misjudging you.&mdash;</P>
<P>Deare&s;t, deare&s;t creature! &s;natching my hand with wildne&s;s, let me be&s;eech you to be <HI>uniformly</HI> noble! <HI>Civil regards,</HI> Madam!&mdash;<HI>Civil regards!</HI>&mdash;Can you &s;o expect to narrow and confine &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion as mine!&mdash;</P>
<P>Such a pa&s;&s;ion as yours, Mr. Lovelace, <HI>de&s;erves</HI> to be narrow'd and confin'd.&mdash;It is either the pa&s;&s;ion <HI>you</HI> do not think it; or <HI>I</HI> do not.&mdash;I que&s;tion whe|ther your mind is capable of being <HI>&s;o</HI> narrow'd and <HI>&s;o</HI> widen'd, as is nece&s;&s;ary to make it be what I wi&s;h

it to be. Lift up your hands and your eyes, Sir, in that emphatical &s;ilent wonder, as you plea&s;e: But what does it expre&s;s, what does it convince me of; but that we are not born for one another?</P>
<P>By his &s;oul, he &s;aid, and gra&s;p'd my hand with an eagerne&s;s that hurt it, we <HI>were</HI> born for one another: I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be his&mdash;I <HI>&s;hould</HI> be his (and put his other arm round me), altho' his damnation were to be the pur|cha&s;e!&mdash;</P>
<P>I was terrify'd!&mdash;Let me leave you&mdash;or begone from me, Sir&mdash;Is the pa&s;&s;ion you boa&s;t, to be thus &s;hockingly declared!</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not go, Madam!&mdash;You mu&s;t <HI>not</HI> leave me in anger&mdash;</P>
<P>I will return&mdash;I will return&mdash;When you can be le&s;s violent&mdash;le&s;s &s;hocking.</P>
<P>And he let me go.</P>
<P>The man quite frighted me; in&s;omuch that when I got into my chamber, I found a &s;udden flow of tears a great relief to me.</P>
<P>In half an hour, he &s;ent a little billet, expre&s;&s;ing his concern for the vehemence of his behaviour, and praying to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>I went&mdash;Becau&s;e I could not help my&s;elf, I went.</P>
<P>He was full of his excu&s;es.&mdash;O my dear, what would you, even <HI>you,</HI> do with &s;uch a man as this; and in my &s;ituation?</P>
<P>It was very po&s;&s;ible for him now, he &s;aid, to ac|count for the workings of a frenzical di&s;order. For his part, he was near di&s;traction. All la&s;t week to &s;uffer as he had &s;uffer'd; and now to talk of <HI>civil re|gards</HI> only, when he had hoped from the noblene&s;s of my mind&mdash;</P>
<P>Hope what you will, interrupted I; I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it, that our minds are by no means &s;uited to each other. You have brought me into difficulties. I am de&s;erted of every friend but Mi&s;s Howe. My
<PB N="52" REF="59">
true &s;entiments I will not conceal: It is again&s;t my will, that I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to owe protection from a bro|ther's projects, which Mi&s;s Howe thinks are not given over, to you, who have brought me into the&s;e &s;treights; <HI>not</HI> with my own concurrence brought me into them; remember that&mdash;</P>
<P>I do remember that, Madam! So often reminded, how can I forget it?</P>
<P>Yet I <HI>will</HI> owe to you this protection, if it be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in the earne&s;t hope, that you will <HI>&s;hun</HI> rather than <HI>&s;eek</HI> mi&s;chief, if any further inquiry after me be made. But what hinders you from leaving me?&mdash;Cannot I &s;end to you? The Widow Fretchville, it is plain, knows not her own mind: The people here indeed are civiller every day than other: But I had ra|ther have lodgings more agreeable to my circum|&s;tances. I be&s;t know what will &s;uit them; and am re&s;olved not to be obliged to any body. If you leave me, I will take a civil leave of the&s;e people, and re|tire to &s;ome one of the neighbouring villages, and there, &s;ecreting my&s;elf, wait my cou&s;in Morden's ar|rival with patience.</P>
<P>He pre&s;umed, he told me, from what I &s;aid, that my application to my relations was un&s;ucce&s;sful: That therefore he hoped I would give him leave now to mention the terms in the nature of &s;ettlements, which he had long intended to propo&s;e to me; and which having till now delay'd to do, thro' accidents not proceeding from him&s;elf, he had thoughts of urg|ing to me the moment I enter'd upon my new hou&s;e; and upon finding my&s;elf as independent in <HI>appear|ance</HI> as I was in <HI>fact.</HI> Permit me, Madam, to pro|po&s;e the&s;e matters to you:&mdash;Not with an expectation of your immediate an&s;wer; but for your con&s;idera|tion.</P>
<P>Were not he&s;itation, a &s;elf-felt glow, a downca&s;t eye, more than enough? Your advice was too much in my head: I he&s;itated.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="60">He urg'd on upon my &s;ilence: He would call God to witne&s;s to the ju&s;tice, nay to the <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> of his in|tentions to me, if I would be &s;o good as to hear what he had to propo&s;e to me, as to &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>Could not the man have fallen into the &s;ubject without this <HI>parade?</HI> Many a point, you know, <HI>is</HI> refu&s;ed, and <HI>ought to be</HI> refu&s;ed, if leave be a&s;ked to introduce it; and when once refu&s;ed, the refu&s;al mu&s;t in honour be adhered to:&mdash;Whereas, had it been <HI>&s;lid</HI> in upon one, as I may &s;ay, it might have merited fur|ther con&s;ideration. If &s;uch a man as he knows not this, who &s;hould?</P>
<P>I thought my&s;elf obliged, tho' not to depart from this &s;ubject intirely, yet, to give it a more diffu&s;e turn; in order, on the one hand, to &s;ave my&s;elf the morti|fication of appearing too ready in my compliance, after &s;uch a di&s;tance as had been between us; and on the other, to avoid (in pur&s;uance of your advice) the nece&s;&s;ity of giving him &s;uch a repul&s;e, as might again throw us out of the cour&s;e.</P>
<P>A cruel alternative to be reduced to!</P>
<P>You talk of <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid I; and you talk of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI>; perhaps without having con&s;ider'd the force of the words, in the &s;en&s;e you u&s;e them on this occa&s;ion.&mdash;Let me tell you what <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> is, in my &s;en&s;e of the word&mdash;TRUE GENEROSITY is not confined to pecuniary in&s;tances: It is <HI>more</HI> than po|litene&s;s: It is <HI>more</HI> than good faith: It is <HI>more</HI> than honour: It is <HI>more</HI> than <HI>ju&s;tice:</HI> Since all the&s;e are but duties, and what a worthy mind cannot di&s;pen&s;e with. But TRUE GENEROSITY is greatne&s;s of &s;oul: It in|cites us to do more by a fellow-creature, than can be &s;trictly required of us: It obliges us to ha&s;ten to the relief of an object that wants relief; anticipating even hope or expectation. Genero&s;ity, Sir, will not &s;urely permit a worthy mind to doubt of its honourable and beneficent intentions: Much le&s;s will it allow it&s;elf to &s;hock, to offend any one; and, lea&s;t of all, a per|&s;on

thrown by adver&s;ity, mi&s;hap, or accident, into its protection.</P>
<P>What an opportunity had he to clear his intentions, had he been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, from the <HI>latter part</HI> of this home ob&s;ervation!&mdash;But he run away with the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and kept to that.</P>
<P>Admirably defin'd! he &s;aid.&mdash;But who at this rate, Madam, can be &s;aid to be <HI>generous</HI> to you?&mdash;Your <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> I implore; while, <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> as it mu&s;t be my &s;ole merit, &s;hall be my aim. Never was there a wo|man of &s;uch nice and delicate &s;entiments!</P>
<P>It is a reflection upon your&s;elf, Sir, and upon the company you have kept, if you think the&s;e notions either nice or delicate. Thou&s;ands of my &s;ex are more nice than I; for they would have avoided the devious path I have been &s;urprized into: The con&s;e|quences of which &s;urprize have laid me under the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of telling a man, who has not delicacy enough to enter into tho&s;e parts of the female chara|cter, which are its glory and di&s;tinction, what True Genero&s;ity is.</P>
<P>His divine monitre&s;s, he called me!&mdash;He would en|deavour to form his manners, as he had often pro|mi&s;ed, by my example. But he hoped I would now permit him to mention briefly the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> he propo&s;ed to do me, in the terms of the &s;ettlement; a &s;ubject &s;o proper, before now, to have been enter'd upon; and which would have been enter'd upon long ago, had not my frequent di&s;plea&s;ure taken from him the opportunity he had often wi&s;h'd for: But now having ventur'd to lay hold of this, nothing &s;hould divert him from improving it.</P>
<P>I have no &s;pirits ju&s;t now, Sir, to attend to &s;uch weighty points. What you have a mind to propo&s;e, write to me: And I &s;hall know what an&s;wer to re|turn. Only one thing let me remind you of, that if you touch upon any &s;ubject, in which my papa has
<PB N="55" REF="62">
a concern, I &s;hall judge by your treatment of the father, what value you have for the daughter.</P>
<P>He <HI>looked,</HI> as if he would choo&s;e rather to &s;peak than write: But had he <HI>&s;aid</HI> &s;o, I had a &s;evere return to have made upon him; as po&s;&s;ibly he might &s;ee by <HI>my</HI> looks.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>IN this way are we now: A &s;ort of calm, as I &s;aid, &s;ucceeding a &s;torm:&mdash;What may happen next, whe|ther a &s;torm or a calm, with &s;uch a &s;pirit as I have to deal with, who can tell?</P>
<P>But be that as it will, I think, my dear, I am not <HI>meanly</HI> off: And that is a great point with me; and which I know you'll be glad to hear: If it were on|ly, that I can &s;ee this man without lo&s;ing any of that dignity (what other word can I u&s;e, &s;peaking of <HI>my|&s;elf,</HI> that betokens <HI>decency,</HI> and not <HI>arrogance?</HI>) which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to enable me to look <HI>up,</HI> or rather, with the <HI>mind's</HI> eye, I may &s;ay, to look <HI>down</HI> upon a man of this man's ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Altho' circum&s;tances have &s;o offer'd, that I could not take your advice as to the <HI>manner</HI> of dealing with him; yet you gave me &s;o much courage by it, as has enabled me to conduct things to this i&s;&s;ue; as well as determin'd me again&s;t leaving him: Which <HI>before,</HI> I was thinking to do, at all adventures. Whether, when it came to the point, I <HI>&s;hould</HI> have done &s;o, or not, I cannot &s;ay, becau&s;e it would have depended upon his behaviour at the time.</P>
<P>But let his behaviour be what it will, I am afraid, with you, that, &s;hould any thing offer, at la&s;t, to oblige me to leave him, I &s;hall not mend my &s;ituation in the world's eye; but the contrary. And yet I will not be treated by him with indignity, while I have any power to help my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You, my dear, have accu&s;ed me of having <HI>mode&s;ty'd-away,</HI> as you phra&s;e it, &s;everal opportunities of being&mdash;Being what, my dear?&mdash;Why, the wife of a liber|tine:
<PB N="56" REF="63">
And what a libertine and his wife are, my cou&s;in Morden's letter tells us.&mdash;Let me here, once for all, endeavour to account for the motives of my behaviour to this man, and for the principles I have proceeded upon, as they appear to me upon a clo&s;e &s;elf-examina|tion.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed then to allow me to think, that my mo|tives on this occa&s;ion, ari&s;e not <HI>altogether</HI> from maid|enly nicene&s;s; nor yet from the apprehen&s;ion of what my pre&s;ent tormentor, and future hu&s;band, may think of a precipitate compliance, on &s;uch a di&s;agreeable behaviour as his: But they ari&s;e principally from what offers to my own heart, re&s;pecting, as I may &s;ay, its own rectitude, its own judgment of the <HI>fit</HI> and the <HI>unfit</HI>; as I would, without &s;tudy, an&s;wer <HI>for</HI> my&s;elf <HI>to</HI> my&s;elf, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place; to <HI>him,</HI> and to the <HI>world,</HI> in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> only. Principles, that <HI>are</HI> in my mind; that I <HI>found</HI> there; implanted, no doubt, by the fir&s;t gracious Planter: Which therefore <HI>impell</HI> me, as I may &s;ay, to act up to them, that thereby I may, to the be&s;t of my judgment, be enabled to comport my&s;elf worthily in both &s;tates (the &s;ingle and the married), let others act as they will by <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, my dear, I do not deceive my&s;elf, and, in|&s;tead of &s;etting about rectifying what is ami&s;s in my heart, endeavour to find excu&s;es for habits and pecu|liarities, which I am unwilling to ca&s;t off or overcome. The heart is very deceitful: Do you, my dear friend, lay mine open (but, &s;urely, it is always open before you!) and &s;pare me not, if you find or think it culpable.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation, once for all, as I &s;aid, I thought proper to make, to convince you, that, to the be&s;t of my judgment, my errors, in matters as well of the le&s;&s;er moment, as the greater, &s;hall rather be the fault of my under&s;tanding than of my will.</P>

<P>MR. Lovelace has &s;ent me, by Dorcas, his pro|po&s;als, as follow:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'To &s;pare a delicacy &s;o extreme, and to obey you, I write: And the rather, that you may communi|cate this paper to Mi&s;s Howe, who may con&s;ult any of her friends you &s;hall think proper to have intru&s;ted on this occa&s;ion. I &s;ay, <HI>intru&s;ted</HI>; becau&s;e, as you know, I have given it out to &s;everal per&s;ons, that we are actually marry'd.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'In the fir&s;t place, Madam, I offer to &s;ettle upon you, by way of jointure, your whole e&s;tate.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'My too great contempt of cen&s;ure has &s;ubjected me to much traduction.

I will engage Lord M. to write to <HI>you,</HI> what he propo&s;es to do on the happy occa&s;ion: Not as your de&s;ire or expectation, but to demon&s;trate, that no advantage is intended to be taken of the &s;ituation you are in with your own family.'</Q></P>

I have no doubt, but he will be put upon making large de|mands upon you. All tho&s;e it &s;hall be in your power to comply with, for the &s;ake of your own peace. And the remainder &s;hall be paid into your hands, and be intirely at your di&s;po&s;al, as a fund to &s;upport tho&s;e charitable donations, which I have heard you &s;o famed for <HI>out</HI> of your family; and for which you have been &s;o greatly reflected upon <HI>in</HI> it.'</Q></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedne&s;day Morning, May</HI> 17.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Lovelace would fain have engag'd me la&s;t night. But as I was not prepar'd to enter upon the &s;ubject of his propo&s;als, intending to con&s;ider them maturely, and was not highly plea&s;ed with his con|clu&s;ion (and then there is hardly any getting from him in tolerable time over-night), I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed &s;eeing him till morning.</P>
<P>About &s;even o'clock we met in the dining-room. I find, he was full of expectation that I &s;hould meet him with a very favourable, who knows, but with a <HI>thankful</HI> a&s;pect?&mdash;And I immediately found by his &s;ullen countenance, that he was under no &s;mall di&s;|app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">intment that I did not.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t love, are you well?&mdash;Why look you &s;o &s;olemn upon me?&mdash;Will your indifference never
<PB N="61" REF="68">
be over?&mdash;If I have propo&s;ed terms in any re&s;pect <HI>&s;hort</HI> of your expectation&mdash;</P>
<P>I told him, that he had very con&s;iderately men|tion'd my &s;hewing his propo&s;als to Mi&s;s Howe, and con&s;ulting any of her friends upon them by her means; and I &s;hould have an opportunity to &s;end them to her, by Collins, by-and-by; and &s;o in&s;i&s;ted to &s;u&s;pend any talk upon that &s;ubject till I had her opinion upon them.</P>
<P>Good God!&mdash;If there were but the lea&s;t loop-hole; the lea&s;t room for delay!&mdash;But he was writing a letter to his uncle, to give him an account of his &s;ituation with me, and could not fini&s;h it &s;o &s;atisfactorily, either to my Lord, or to him&s;elf, as if I would conde|&s;cend to &s;ay, whether the terms he had propo&s;ed were acceptable, or not.</P>
<P>Thus far, I told him, I could &s;ay, That my prin|cipal point was peace and reconciliation with my fa|mily. As to other matters, the genteelne&s;s of his own &s;pirit would put him upon doing more for me than I &s;hould a&s;k, or expect. Wherefore, if all he had to write about was to know what Lord M. would do on my account, he might &s;pare him&s;elf the trouble; for that my utmo&s;t wi&s;hes as to my&s;elf, were much more ea&s;ily gratify'd than he perhaps imagin'd.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked me then, If I would &s;o far permit him to touch upon the happy day, as to reque&s;t his uncle's pre&s;ence on the occa&s;ion, and to be my father?</P>
<P><HI>Father</HI> had a &s;weet and venerable &s;ound with it, I &s;aid. I &s;hould be glad to have a father who would own me!</P>
<P>Was not this plain &s;peaking, think you, my dear? Yet it rather, I mu&s;t own, appears &s;o to me on re|flection, than was <HI>de&s;igned</HI> freely at the time. For I then, with a &s;igh from the bottom of my heart, thought of my <HI>own father</HI>; bitterly regretting, that I am an outca&s;t from him and from my mother.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, I thought, &s;eemed a little affected; at
<PB N="62" REF="69">
the <HI>manner</HI> of my &s;peaking, as well as at the &s;ad refle|ction, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>I am but a very young creature, Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid I, and wiped my averted eye, altho' you have <HI>kindly,</HI> and in <HI>love to me,</HI> introduced &s;o much &s;orrow to me already: So you mu&s;t not wonder, that the word <HI>father</HI> &s;trikes &s;o &s;en&s;ibly upon the heart of a child, ever dutiful till &s;he knew you, and who&s;e ten|der years &s;till require the paternal wing.</P>
<P>He turned towards the window: [Rejoice with me, my dear, &s;ince I &s;eem devoted to him, that the man is not ab&s;olutely impenetrable!]&mdash;His emotion was vi&s;ible; yet he endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s it&mdash;Ap|proaching me again; again he was obliged to turn from me; Angelic &s;omething, he &s;aid: But then, obtain|ing a heart more <HI>&s;uitable</HI> to his wi&s;h, he once more approached me.&mdash;For his own part, he &s;aid, as Lord M. was &s;o &s;ubject to the gout, he was afraid, that the compliment he had ju&s;t propo&s;ed to make him, might, if made, occa&s;ion a longer &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, than he could bear to think of: And if it did, it would vex him to the heart, that he had made it.</P>
<P>I could not &s;ay a &s;ingle word to this, you know, my dear. But you will gue&s;s at my thoughts of what h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aid&mdash;So much pa&s;&s;ionate love, <HI>lip-deep!</HI> So prudent and &s;o dutifully patient <HI>at heart</HI> to a relation he had till now, &s;o undutifully de&s;pi&s;ed!&mdash;Why, why, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I thrown upon &s;uch a man! thought I.&mdash;</P>
<P>He he&s;itated, as if contending with him&s;elf, an after taking a turn or two about the room,&mdash;He w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at a great lo&s;s what to determine upon, he &s;aid, be+cau&s;e he had not the honour of knowing when he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be made the happie&s;t of men:&mdash;Would to God might that very in&s;tant be re&s;olved upon!</P>
<P>He &s;topp'd a moment or two, &s;taring in my dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ca&s;t face [Did I not, O my beloved friend, thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you, want a father or a mother ju&s;t then?] But he could not, &s;o <HI>&s;oon</HI> as he wi&s;hed, procure my co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;ent
<PB N="63" REF="70">
to a day; in <HI>that</HI> ca&s;e, he thought the compli|ment might <HI>as well</HI> be made to Lord M. as <HI>not:</HI>&mdash;Since the &s;ettlements might be drawn and ingro&s;&s;ed in the intervenient time, which would pacify his im|patience, as no time would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>You will &s;uppo&s;e how <HI>I</HI> was affected by this &s;peech, by repeating the &s;ub&s;tance of what <HI>he</HI> &s;aid upon it; as follows.</P>
<P>&mdash;But by his &s;oul, he knew not, &s;o much was I upon the re&s;erve, and &s;o much latent meaning did my eye import, whether, when he mo&s;t hoped to plea&s;e me, he was not farthe&s;t from doing &s;o. Would I vouch&s;afe to &s;ay, Whether I approved of his compli|ment to Lord M. or not?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe, thought I, at that moment, &s;ays, I mu&s;t <HI>not</HI> run away from This man!</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Mr. Lovelace, if this matter is <HI>ever to be,</HI> it mu&s;t be agreeable to me to have the full appro|bation of <HI>one</HI> &s;ide, &s;ince I cannot have that of the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If this matter be ever to be!</HI> Good God! what words were tho&s;e at this time of day! And full <HI>ap|probation</HI> of one &s;ide! Why that word <HI>approbation?</HI> When the greate&s;t pride of all his family was, That of having the honour of &s;o dear a creature for their relation? Would to Heaven, my deare&s;t life, added he, that, without complimenting <HI>Any</HI>-body, to-mor|row might be the happie&s;t day of my life!&mdash;What &s;ay you, my angel? With a trembling impatience, that <HI>&s;eemed</HI> not affected,&mdash;What &s;ay you for <HI>to-morrow?</HI></P>
<P>It was likely, my dear, I could &s;ay much to it, or name another day, had I been di&s;po&s;ed to the latter, with &s;uch an hinted delay from him.</P>
<P><HI>Next</HI> day, Madam, if not <HI>to-morrow!</HI>&mdash;Or the <HI>day after that!</HI>&mdash;And taking my two hands, &s;tared me into a half-confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>No, no! You cannot think all of a &s;udden, there
<PB N="64" REF="71">
&s;hould be rea&s;on for &s;uch a hurry. It will be mo&s;t agreeable, to be &s;ure, for my Lord to be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I am all obedience and re&s;ignation, returned the wretch, with a &s;elf-pluming air, as if he had acqui|e&s;ced to a propo&s;al made by me, and had complimented me with a great piece of &s;elf-denial.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty, I think, required it of me, that it &s;hould pa&s;s &s;o: Did it not?&mdash;I think it did. Would to Hea|ven&mdash;But what &s;ignifies wi&s;hing?</P>
<P>But when he would have <HI>rewarded him&s;elf,</HI> as he had heretofore called it, for this &s;elf-&s;uppo&s;ed conce&s;|&s;ion, with a ki&s;s, I repul&s;ed him with a ju&s;t and very &s;incere di&s;dain.</P>

<P>Four letters are written by Mr. Lovelace from the date of his la&s;t, giving the &s;tate of affairs between him and the lady, pretty much the &s;ame as in hers in the &s;ame period, allowing for the humour in his; and for his re&s;entments expre&s;&s;ed with vehemence on her re|&s;olution to leave him, if her friends could be prevailed upon.&mdash;A few extracts from them will be only given.</P>

''Tis plain &s;he would have given me up for ever; nor &s;hould I have been able to prevent her abandoning of me, unle&s;s I had torn up the tree by the roots to come at the fruit; which I hope &s;till to bring down by a gentle &s;hake or two, if I can but have patience to &s;tay the ripening &s;ea&s;on.'</Q></P>

<P>I Would conceal nothing from you that relates to your&s;elf &s;o much as the inclo&s;ed. You will &s;ee what the noble writer apprehends from you, and wi&s;hes of you, with regard to Mi&s;s Harlowe, and how much at heart all your relations have it, that you do honourably by her. They compliment me with an influence over you, which I wi&s;h with all my &s;oul you would let me have in this article.</P>
<P>Let me once more intreat thee, Lovelace, to re|flect, before it be too late, before the mortal offence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e given, upon the graces and merits of this lady. Let thy frequent remor&s;es at la&s;t end in one effectual one. Let not pride and wantonne&s;s of heart, ruin thy fairer pro&s;pects. By my faith, Lovelace, there is nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut vanity, conceit, and non&s;en&s;e, in our wild &s;chemes. As we grow older, we &s;hall be wi&s;er, and looking back upon our fooli&s;h notions of the pre&s;ent hour, &s;hall certainly de&s;pi&s;e our&s;elves (our youth di&s;&s;i|pated), when we think of the honourable engagements we might have made. Thou, more e&s;pecially, if thou lette&s;t &s;uch a matchle&s;s creature &s;lide thro' thy fingers. A creature pure from her cradle. In all her actions and &s;entiments uniformly noble. Strict in the per|formance of all her even <HI>unrewarded</HI> duties to the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable of fathers, what a wife will &s;he make the man who &s;hall have the honour to call her his!</P>
<P>Reflect likewi&s;e upon her &s;ufferings for thee. Actual|ly
<PB N="72" REF="79">
at the time thou art forming &s;chemes to ruin her (at lea&s;t, in <HI>her</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word) is &s;he not labouring under a father's cur&s;e laid upon her by thy means, and for thy &s;ake? And would&s;t thou give operation and completion to this cur&s;e?</P>
<P>And what, Lovelace, all the time is thy pride? Thou that vainly imagine&s;t, that the whole family of the, Harlowes, and that of the Howes too, are but thy machines, unknown to them&s;elves, to bring about thy purpo&s;es, and thy revenge: What art thou more, or better, than the in&s;trument even of her implacable brother, and envious &s;i&s;ter, to perpetrate the di&s;grace of the mo&s;t excellent of &s;i&s;ters, which they are moved to by vilely low and &s;ordid motives?&mdash;Can&s;t thou bear, Lovelace, to be thought the machine of thy in|veterate enemy James Harlowe?&mdash;Nay, art thou not the cully of that &s;till viler Jo&s;eph Leman, who &s;erves him&s;elf as much by thy money, as he does thee by the double part he acts by thy direction?&mdash;And the devil's agent be&s;ides, who only can, and who cer|tainly will, &s;uitably reward thee, if thou proceede&s;t, and if thou effecte&s;t thy wicked purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>Could any man but you put together upon paper the following que&s;tions, with &s;o much unconcern as you &s;eem to have written them?&mdash;Give them a reperu&s;al, O heart of adamant!

<P>Thou knowe&s;t, that I have no intere&s;t, that I can have no view, in wi&s;hing thee to do ju&s;tice to this ad|mirable creature.

But if thou do&s;t <HI>not,</HI> and if thou ruine&s;t &s;uch a virtue, all the complicated wickedne&s;s of ten devils, let loo&s;e among the innocent, with full power over them, will not do &s;o much vile and ba&s;e mi&s;chief as thou wilt be guilty of.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the prince on his throne is not &s;afe, if a mind &s;o de&s;perate can be found, as values not its <HI>own</HI> life. So may it be &s;aid, that the mo&s;t immacu|late virtue is not &s;afe, if a man can be met with, who has no regard to his own honour, and makes a je&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows and prote&s;tations.</P>
<P>Thou maye&s;t by trick, chicane, and fal&s;e colours, thou who art wor&s;e than a pickeroon in love, over|come a poor lady &s;o intangled as thou ha&s;t intangled her; &s;o unprotected as thou ha&s;t made her: But con&s;ider, how much more generous and ju&s;t to her, and noble to thy&s;elf, it is, to overcome <HI>thy&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, it is no matter, whether my pa&s;t or future actions countenance my preachment, as perhaps thou'lt call what I have written: But this I promi&s;e thee, that whenever I meet with a woman of but one half of Mi&s;s Harlowe's perfections, who will favour me with her acceptance, I will take the ad|vice

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF any man in the world has power over my ne|phew, it is you. I therefore write this, to beg you to interfere in the affair depending between him and the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of women, as every one &s;ays; and <HI>what every one &s;ays, mu&s;t be true.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="82">I don't know that he has any bad de&s;igns upon her; but I know his temper too well, not to be apprehen&s;ive upon &s;uch long delays: And the ladies here have been for &s;ome time in fear for her; my &s;i&s;ter Sadleir, in particular, who (you know) is a wi&s;e woman, &s;ays, that the&s;e delays, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, mu&s;t be from him, rather than from the lady. He had always in|deed a &s;trong antipathy to marriage; and may think of playing his dog's tricks by her, as he has by &s;o many others. If there's any danger of this, 'tis be&s;t to prevent it in time: For, <HI>when a thing is done, ad|vice comes too late.</HI></P>
<P>He has always had the folly and impertinence to make a je&s;t of me for u&s;ing proverbs: But as they are the wi&s;dom of whole nations and ages, collected into a &s;mall compa&s;s, I am not to be &s;hamed out of &s;entences, that often contain more wi&s;dom in them, than the tedious harangues of mo&s;t of our par&s;ons and morali&s;ts. Let him laugh at them, if he plea&s;es: You and I know better things, Mr. Belford.&mdash;<HI>Tho' you have kept company with a wolf, you have not learnt to howl of him.</HI></P>
<P>But neverthele&s;s, you mu&s;t not let him know, that I have written to you on this &s;ubject. I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay it; but he has ever treated me, as if I were a man of very common under&s;tanding. And would perhaps think never the better of the be&s;t advice in the world, for coming from me.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, he has no rea&s;on to &s;light me as he does. He may and will be the better for me, if he outlives me; tho' he once told me to my face, That I might do as I would with my e&s;tate; for that he, for his part, loved his liberty as much as he de&s;pi&s;ed money. He thought, I &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>I could not cover him with my wings, without pecking at him with my bill</HI>; tho' I never u&s;ed to be pecking at him, without very great occa&s;ion: And, God knows, he might have my very heart, if he would but endeavour to oblige me, by
<PB N="76" REF="83">
&s;tudying his own good; for that is all I de&s;ire of him. Indeed, it was his poor mother that fir&s;t &s;poil'd him; and I have been but too indulgent to him &s;ince.&mdash;A fine grateful di&s;po&s;ition, you'll &s;ay, to <HI>return evil for good!</HI> But that was always his way.</P>
<P>This match, however, as the lady has &s;uch an ex|traordinary &s;hare of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, might &s;et all to rights: and if you can forward it, I would enable him to make whatever &s;ettlements he could wi&s;h; and &s;hould not be unwilling to put him in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of another pretty e&s;tate be&s;ides: For what do I live for (as I have often &s;aid), but to &s;ee him and my two nieces well married and &s;ettled? May heaven &s;ettle him down to a better mind, and turn his heart to more of goodne&s;s and con&s;ideration!</P>
<P>If the delays are on his &s;ide, I tremble for the lady; and, if on hers (as he tells my niece Charlotte), I could wi&s;h the young lady were apprized, that <HI>Delays are dangerous.</HI> Excellent as &s;he is, I can tell her, &s;he ought not to depend on her merits with &s;uch a change|able fellow, and &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ed marriage-hater, as he has been. I know you are very good at giving kind hints. <HI>A word to the wi&s;e is enough.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h you would try what you can do with him; for I have warned him &s;o often of his wicked prac|tices, that I begin to de&s;pair of my words having any effect upon him. But let him remember, that <HI>Ven|geance, tho' it comes with leaden feet, &s;trikes with iron hands.</HI> If he behaves ill in this ca&s;e, he may find it &s;o. What a pity it is, that a man of his talents and learning &s;hould be &s;o vile a rake! Alas! alas! <HI>Une poign&eacute;e de bonne vie vaut mieux que plein muy de clerg&eacute;</HI>; A handful of good life is better than a whole bu&s;hel of learning.</P>
<P>You may throw in, too, as his friend, that, &s;hould he provoke me, it may not be too late for me to marry. My old friend Wycherly did &s;o, when he was older than I am, on purpo&s;e to plague <HI>his</HI> ne|phew:
<PB N="77" REF="84">
And, in&s;pite of this gout, I might have a child or two &s;till. And have not been without &s;ome thoughts that way, when he has angered me more than ordi|nary: But the&s;e thoughts have gone off again hitherto, upon my con&s;idering, that <HI>the children of very young and very old men</HI> [tho' I am not &s;o very old neither] <HI>la&s;t not long</HI>; and that <HI>old men, when they marry young women,</HI> are &s;aid to <HI>make much of death:</HI> Yet who knows but that matrimony might be good again&s;t the gouty humours I am troubled with?</P>
<P>The &s;entences, that I have purpo&s;ely wove into my di&s;cour&s;e, may be of &s;ome &s;ervice to you in talking to him; but u&s;e them &s;paringly, that he may not di&s;|cover, that you borrow your <HI>darts</HI> from my <HI>quiver.</HI></P>
<P>May your good coun&s;els, Mr. Belford, founded up|on the hints I have given, pierce his heart, and incite him to do what will be &s;o happy for him&s;elf, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the honour of that admirable lady whom I long to &s;ee his wife; and, if I may, I will not think of one for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Should he abu&s;e the confidence &s;he has plac'd in him, I my&s;elf &s;hall pray, that vengeance may f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll upon his head.&mdash;<HI>Raro</HI>&mdash;<HI>Raro</HI>&mdash;(I quite forget all my Latin! but I think it is)&mdash;<HI>Raro antecedentem &s;ce|le&s;tum de&s;eruit pede poena claudo:</HI> Where vice goes before, vengeance (&s;ooner or later) will follow.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make no apologies to you for this trouble. I know how well you love him and me; and there is nothing in which you could &s;erve us both more im|portantly, than in forwarding this match to the ut|mo&s;t of your power. When it is done, how &s;hall I rejoice to &s;ee you at M. Hall! Mean time, I &s;hall long to hear, that you are likely to be &s;ucce&s;sful; and am,</P>

<P>WHEN I have opened my views to thee &s;o amply, as I have done in my former letters; and have told thee, that my principal de&s;ign is but to bring virtue to a trial, that, <HI>if</HI> virtue, it need not be afraid of; and that the reward of it will be marriage (that is to &s;ay, if, after I have carried my point, I cannot prevail upon her to live with me the Life of Honour<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>III.</HI> p. <HI>111.</HI></NOTE>; for that thou knowe&s;t is the wi&s;h of my heart); I am amazed at the repetition of thy wambling non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I am of opinion with thee, that &s;ome time hence, when I am <HI>grown wi&s;er,</HI> I &s;hall conclude, that <HI>there is nothing but vanity, conceit, and non&s;en&s;e, in my pre|&s;ent wild &s;chemes.</HI> But what is this &s;aying, but that I mu&s;t be <HI>fir&s;t</HI> wi&s;er?</P>
<P>I do not intend <HI>to let this matchle&s;s creature &s;lide through my fingers.</HI></P>
<P>Art thou able to &s;ay half the things in her prai&s;e, that I have &s;aid, and am continually &s;aying or writing?</P>
<P>Her gloomy father cur&s;ed the &s;weet creature, be|cau&s;e &s;he put it out of his wicked power to compel her to have the man &s;he hated. Thou knowe&s;t how little merit &s;he has with me on this &s;core.&mdash;And &s;hall I not try the virtue I intend, upon full proof, to reward, be|cau&s;e her father is a tyrant?&mdash;Why art thou thus eternally reflecting upon &s;o excellent a woman, as if thou wert a&s;&s;ured &s;he would fail in the trial?&mdash;Nay, thou declare&s;t, every time thou write&s;t on the &s;ubject, that &s;he <HI>will,</HI> that &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> yield, <HI>intangled as &s;he is:</HI> And yet make&s;t her virtue the pretence of thy &s;olicitude for her.</P>
<P><HI>An in&s;trument of the vile James Harlowe,</HI> do&s;t thou call me?&mdash;O Jack! how I could cur&s;e thee!&mdash;<HI>I</HI> an
<PB N="80" REF="87">
<HI>in&s;trument</HI> of that brother! of that &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;But mark the end&mdash;And thou &s;halt &s;ee what will become of that brother, and of that &s;i&s;ter!</P>
<P>Play not again&s;t me my own acknowleged &s;en&s;i|bilities, I de&s;ire thee. Sen&s;ibilities which, at the &s;ame time that they contradict thy charge of an <HI>adamantine heart</HI> in thy friend, thou had&s;t known nothing of, had I not communicated them to thee.</P>
<P><HI>If I ruin &s;uch a virtue,</HI> &s;aye&s;t thou?&mdash;Eternal mo|notoni&s;t!&mdash;Again; <HI>The mo&s;t immaculate virtue may be ruined by men, who have no regard to their honour, and who make a je&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths,</HI> &amp;c. What mu&s;t be the virtue that will be ruined without oaths? Is not the world full of the&s;e deceptions? And are not <HI>lovers oaths</HI> a je&s;t of hundreds of years &s;tanding? And are not cautions again&s;t the perfidy of our &s;ex, a ne|ce&s;&s;ary part of the female education?</P>
<P>I do intend to endeavour to overcome <HI>my&s;elf</HI>; but I mu&s;t fir&s;t try, if I cannot overcome <HI>this lady.</HI> Have I not &s;aid, that the honour of her Sex is concerned that I &s;hould <HI>try?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whenever thou meete&s;t with a woman of but half her perfections, thou wilt marry.</HI>&mdash;Do, Jack.</P>
<P>Can a girl be <HI>degraded by trials,</HI> who is not <HI>over|come?</HI></P>
<P>I am glad, that thou take&s;t crime to thy&s;elf, for not endeavouring to convert the poor wretches whom <HI>others</HI> have ruined. I will not recriminate upon thee, Belford, as I might, when thou flattere&s;t thy&s;elf, that thou never ruined&s;t the morals of any young creature, who otherwi&s;e would not have been corrupted.&mdash;The palliating con&s;olation of an Hottentot heart, de|termined rather to gluttonize on the garbage of other &s;oul feeders, than to reform.&mdash;But tell me, Jack, would&s;t thou have &s;pared &s;uch a girl as my Ro&s;ebud, had I not, by my example, engaged thy genero&s;ity? Nor was my Ro&s;ebud the only girl I &s;pared:&mdash;When my power was acknowleged, who more merciful than thy friend?</P>
<PB N="81" REF="88">
<Q><L>It is <HI>re&s;i&s;tance</HI> that inflames de&s;ire,</L>
<L>Sharpens the darts of love, and blows its fire.</L>
<L>Love is di&s;arm'd that meets with too much ea&s;e;</L>
<L>He langui&s;hes, and does not care to plea&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>The women know this as well as the men. They love to be addre&s;&s;ed with &s;pirit;
<Q><L>And therefore 'tis their golden fruit they guard</L>
<L>With &s;o much care, to make po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion hard.</L></Q></P>
<P>Whence, for a by-reflection, the ardent, the com|plai&s;ant Gallant is &s;o often preferr'd to the cold Hu&s;|band. And yet the Sex do not con&s;ider, that Variety or Novelty gives the ardour and the ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s; and that, were the Rake as much u&s;ed to them as the Hu&s;band is, he would be (and is to his own wife, if married) <HI>as</HI> indifferent to their favours; and the Hu&s;|band, in his turn, would, to another woman, be the Rake. Let the women, upon the whole, take this le&s;&s;on from a Lovelace-Always to endeavour to make them&s;elves as New to a Hu&s;band, and to appear as elegant and as obliging to him, as they are de&s;irous to appear to a Lover, and actually were to him as <HI>&s;uch</HI>; and then the Rake, which all women love, will la&s;t longer in the Hu&s;band, than it generally does.</P>
<P>But to return:&mdash;If I have not &s;ufficiently clear'd my conduct to thee in the above; I refer thee once more to mine of the 13th of la&s;t month <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>III.</HI> Letter <HI>xvii.</HI> p. <HI>103.</HI></NOTE>. And pr'ythee, Jack, lay me not under a nece&s;&s;ity to repeat the &s;ame things &s;o often. I hope thou reade&s;t what I write more than once.</P>
<P>I am not di&s;plea&s;ed that thou art &s;o apprehen&s;ive of my re&s;entment, that I cannot mi&s;s a day, without making thee unea&s;y. Thy con&s;cience, 'tis plain, tells thee, that thou ha&s;t de&s;erved my di&s;plea&s;ure: And if it has convinced thee of <HI>that,</HI> it will make thee afraid of repeating thy fault. See that this be the con&s;equence. El&s;e, now that thou ha&s;t told me how I can pu|ni&s;h
<PB N="82" REF="89">
thee, it is very likely that I do puni&s;h thee by my &s;ilence, altho' I have as much plea&s;ure in writing on this charming &s;ubject, as thou can&s;t have in reading what I write.</P>
<P>When a boy, if a dog ran away from me thro' fear, I generally looked about for a &s;tone, a &s;tick, or a brickbat; and if neither offer'd to my hand, I &s;kimm'd my hat after him, to make him afraid for &s;omething. What &s;ignifies power, if we do not exert it?</P>
<P>Let my Lord know thou ha&s;t &s;cribbled to me. But give him not the contents of thy epi&s;tle. Tho' a parcel of crude &s;tuff, <HI>he</HI> would think there was &s;ome|thing in it. Poor arguments will do in favour of what we like. But the &s;tupid Peer little thinks, that this lady is a rebel to love. On the contrary, not only he, but all the world, believe her to be a volunteer in his &s;ervice.&mdash;So I &s;hall incur blame, and &s;he will be pity'd, if any thing happen ami&s;s.</P>
<P>Since my Lord's heart is &s;o &s;et upon this match, I have written already to let him know,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That my unhappy character has given my beloved an unge|nerous diffidence of me. That &s;he is &s;o mother-&s;ick and father-fond, that &s;he had rather return to Harlowe-Place, than marry. That &s;he is even ap|prehen&s;ive, that the &s;tep &s;he has taken of going off with me, will make the ladies of a family of &s;uch name and rank as ours, think &s;lightly of her. That therefore I de&s;ire his Lord&s;hip (tho' this hint, I tell him, mu&s;t be very delicately touched) to write me &s;uch a letter as I can &s;hew her. Let him treat me in it ever &s;o freely, I &s;hall not take it ami&s;s, becau&s;e I know his Lord&s;hip takes plea&s;ure in writing to me in a corrective &s;tyle. That he may make what offers he plea&s;es on the marriage. That I de&s;ire his pre|&s;ence at the ceremony; that I may take from his hand the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that mortal man can give me.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90">I have not ab&s;olutely told the lady that I would write to his Lord&s;hip to this effect; yet have given her rea&s;on to think I will. So that without the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity I &s;hall not produce the an&s;wer I expect from him: For I am very loth, I own, to make u&s;e of any of my family's names for the furthering of my de&s;igns. And yet I mu&s;t make all &s;ecure, before I pull off the ma&s;k. This was my motive for bringing her hither.</P>
<P>Thus, thou &s;ee&s;t, that the old Peer's letter came very &s;ea&s;onably. I thank thee for it. But as to his &s;entences, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly do me good. I was early &s;uffocated with his <HI>Wi&s;dom of nations.</HI> When a boy, I never a&s;ked any thing of him, but out flew a <HI>proverb</HI>; and if the tendency of that was to deny me, I never could obtain the lea&s;t favour. This gave me &s;o great an aver&s;ion to the very word, that, when a child, I made it a condition with my tutor, who was an hone&s;t par&s;on, that I would not read my Bible at all, if he would not excu&s;e me one of the wi&s;e&s;t books in it: To which, however, I had no other objection, than that it was called <HI>The Proverbs.</HI> And as for So|lomon, he was then a hated character with me, not becau&s;e of his polygamy, but becau&s;e I had conceived him to be &s;uch another mu&s;ty old fellow as my uncle.</P>
<P>Well, but let us leave old &s;aws to old men.&mdash;What &s;ignifies thy tedious whining over thy departing relation? Is it not generally agreed, that he cannot recover? Will it not be kind in thee, to put him out of his mi&s;ery? I hear, that he is pe&s;ter'd &s;till with vi&s;its from doctors, and apothecaries, and &s;urgeons; that they cannot cut &s;o deep as the mortification has gone; and that in every vi&s;it, in every &s;carification, inevitable death is pronounced upon him. Why then do they keep tormenting him? Is it not to take away more of his living fleece than of his dead fle&s;h?&mdash;When a man is given over, the fee &s;hould &s;urely be refu&s;ed. Are they not now robbing his heirs?&mdash;What ha&s;t thou to do, if the will be as thou'd&s;t have it?&mdash;
<PB N="84" REF="91">
He &s;ent for thee [Did he not?] to clo&s;e his eyes. He is but an <HI>uncle,</HI> is he?</P>
<P>Let me &s;ee, if I mi&s;take not, it is in the Bible, or &s;ome other good book: Can it be in Herodotus?&mdash;O, I believe it is in Jo&s;ephus; A half-&s;acred and half-pro|fane author. He tells us of a king of Syria, put out of his pain by his prime mini&s;ter, or one who de&s;erved to be &s;o for his contrivance. The &s;tory &s;ays, if I am right, that he &s;pread a wet cloth over his face, which killing him, he reigned in his place. A notable fel|low! Perhaps this wet cloth, in the original, is what we now call <HI>laudanum</HI>; a potion that over&s;preads the faculties, as the wet cloth did the face of the royal patient, and the tran&s;lator knew not how to render it.</P>
<P>But how like a forlorn varlet thou &s;ub&s;cribe&s;t, <HI>Thy melancholy friend,</HI> J. BELFORD!&mdash;Melancholy! for what? To &s;tand by, and &s;ee fair play between an old man and death? I thought thou had&s;t been more of a man; thou that art not afraid of an acute death, a &s;word's point, to be &s;o plaguily hyp'd at the con&s;e|quences of a chronical one?&mdash;What tho' the &s;carifi|cators work upon him day by day? it is only upon a <HI>caput mortuum:</HI> And pr'ythee <HI>Go to,</HI> to u&s;e the <HI>&s;ty|lum veterum,</HI> and learn of the <HI>Royal butchers</HI>; who, for &s;port [an hundred times wor&s;e men than thy Love|lace] widow ten thou&s;and at a bru&s;h, and make twice as many fatherle&s;s; and are dubb'd <HI>Magnus</HI> or <HI>Le Grand</HI> for it: Learn of <HI>them,</HI> I &s;ay, how to &s;upport a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> death.</P>

<P>NOT one word will I reply to &s;uch an abandon'd wretch, as thou ha&s;t &s;hewn thy&s;elf to be in thine of la&s;t night. I will leave the lady to the protection of that Power who only can work miracles; and to her own merits. Still I have hopes that the&s;e will &s;ave her.</P>
<P>I will proceed, as thou de&s;ire&s;t, to poor Belton's ca&s;e; and the rather, as it has thrown me into &s;uch a train of thinking upon our pa&s;t lives, our pre&s;ent cour&s;es, and our future views, as may be of &s;ervice to both, if I can give due weight to the reflections that ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>The poor man made me a vi&s;it on Thur&s;day, in this my melancholy attendance. He began with com|plaints of his ill health and &s;pirits, his hectic cough, and his increa&s;ed malady of &s;pitting of blood; and then led to his &s;tory.</P>
<P>A confounded one it is; and which highly aggra|vates his other maladies: For it has come out, that his Thoma&s;ine (who truly would be new-chri&s;ten'd, you know, that her name might be nearer in &s;ound to the chri&s;tian name of the man whom &s;he pretended to doat upon) has for many years carried on an intrigue
<PB N="86" REF="93">
with a fellow who had been ho&s;tler to her father (an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> innkeeper at Darking); of whom, at the expence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> poor Tom, &s;he has made a gentleman; and managed it &s;o, that having the art to make her&s;elf his ca&s;hier, &s;he has been unable to account for large &s;ums, which poor Belton thought forthcoming at his demand, and had tru&s;ted to her cu&s;tody, in order to pay off a mortgage upon his paternal e&s;tate in Kent, which his heart had run upon leaving clear; but which cannot now be done, and will &s;oon be foreclo&s;ed. And yet &s;he has &s;o long pa&s;&s;ed for his wife, that he knows not what to re&s;olve upon about her; nor about the two boys he was &s;o fond of, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be his; whereas now he begins to doubt his &s;hare in them.</P>
<P>So KEEPING don't do, Lovelace. 'Tis not the eligible life.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A man my <HI>keep a woman,</HI> &s;aid the poor fellow to me, but <HI>not his e&s;tate!</HI>&mdash;Two inter|e&s;ts!&mdash;Then, my tottering fabric!'</Q>
pointing to his emaciated carca&s;e.</P>
<P>We do well to value our&s;elves upon our <HI>liberty,</HI> or, to &s;peak more properly, upon the liberties we take! We had need to run down matrimony as we do, and to make that &s;tate the &s;ubject of our frothy je&s;ts; when we frequently render our&s;elves [for this of Tom's is not a <HI>&s;ingular</HI> ca&s;e] the dupes and fools of women, who generally govern us (by arts our wi&s;e heads penetrate not) more ab&s;olutely than a wife would attempt to do!</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider this point a little; and that upon our own <HI>principles,</HI> as <HI>libertines,</HI> &s;etting a&s;ide what the <HI>laws of our country,</HI> and its <HI>cu&s;toms,</HI> oblige from us; which, neverthele&s;s, we cannot get over, till we have got over almo&s;t all moral obligations, as members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, let us con&s;ider [we, who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of e&s;tates by <HI>legal de&s;cent</HI>], how we &s;hould have liked to have been &s;uch naked de&s;titute varlets as we mu&s;t have been, had our fathers been as wi&s;e
<PB N="87" REF="94">
as our&s;elves; and de&s;pi&s;ed matrimony as we do&mdash;And then let us a&s;k our&s;elves, if we ought not to have the &s;ame regard for <HI>our</HI> po&s;terity, as we are glad our fa|thers had for <HI>theirs?</HI></P>
<P>But this, perhaps, is too <HI>moral</HI> a con&s;ideration.&mdash;To proceed therefore to tho&s;e which will be more &s;triking to <HI>us,</HI> How can we rea&s;onably expect oeco|nomy or frugality (or any thing indeed but riot and wa&s;te) from creatures who have an <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> and mu&s;t therefore have <HI>views,</HI> different from our own?</P>
<P>They know the uncertain tenure [our fickle hu|mours] by which they hold: And is it to be won|der'd at, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be provident harlots, that they &s;hould endeavour, if they have the <HI>power, to lay up again&s;t a rainy day</HI>; or, if they have <HI>not</HI> the power, that they &s;hould &s;quander all they can come at, when they are &s;ure of <HI>nothing but the pre&s;ent hour</HI>; and when the life they live, and the &s;acrifices they have made, put con&s;cience and honour out of the que&s;tion?</P>
<P>Whereas a <HI>wife,</HI> having the &s;ame family-intere&s;t with her hu&s;band, lies not under either the &s;ame <HI>ap|prehen&s;ions</HI> or <HI>temptations</HI>; and has not broken through [of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> at lea&s;t, has not] <HI>tho&s;e</HI> re&s;traints which education has fa&s;ten'd upon her: And if &s;he make a private pur&s;e, which we are told by anti-matrimonial|i&s;ts, all wives love to do, and has children, it goes all into the &s;ame family, at the long-run.</P>
<P>Then, as to the great article of fidelity to your bed, are not women of family, who are well-edu|cated, under greater re&s;traints, than creatures, who, if they ever <HI>had</HI> reputation, &s;acrifice it to &s;ordid in|tere&s;t, or to more &s;ordid appetite, the moment they give up to you? Does not the example you furni&s;h, of having &s;ucceeded with her, give encourage|ment for <HI>others</HI> to attempt her likewi&s;e? For, with all her blandi&s;hments, can any man be &s;o credulous,
<PB N="88" REF="95">
or &s;o vain, as to believe, that the woman <HI>be</HI> could per&s;uade, <HI>another</HI> may not prevail upon?</P>
<P>Adultery is &s;o capital a guilt, that even rakes and libertines, if not wholly abandon'd, and, as I may &s;ay, <HI>invited</HI> by a woman's levity, di&s;avow and con|demn it: But here, in a &s;tate of KEEPING, a woman is in no danger of incurring, <HI>legally,</HI> at lea&s;t, that guilt; and you your&s;elf have broken thro', and over|thrown in her, all the fences and boundaries of moral hone&s;ty, and the mode&s;ty and re&s;erves of her Sex: And what tie &s;hall hold her again&s;t inclination, or in|tere&s;t? And what &s;hall deter an attempter?</P>
<P>While a hu&s;band has this &s;ecurity from <HI>legal</HI> &s;an|ctions, that if his wife be detected in a criminal con|ver&s;ation with a man of fortune [the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> likely by bribes to &s;educe her], he may recover very great da|mages, and procure a divorce be&s;ides: Which, to &s;ay nothing of the ignominy, is a con&s;ideration that mu&s;t have &s;ome force upon <HI>both</HI> parties. And a wife mu&s;t be vicious indeed, and a reflection upon a man's own choice, who, for the &s;ake of change, and where there are no qualities to &s;educe, nor affluence to cor|rupt, will run &s;o many hazards to injure her hu&s;band in the tendere&s;t of all points.</P>
<P>But there are difficulties in procuring a divorce&mdash;[And &s;o there ought:]&mdash;And none, &s;ays the rake, in parting with a mi&s;tre&s;s, whenever you &s;u&s;pect her; or, whenever, weary of her, you have a mind to change her for another.</P>
<P>But mu&s;t not the man be a brute indeed, who can ca&s;t off a woman, whom he has &s;educed [If he take her from the town, that's another thing], without &s;ome flagrant rea&s;on; &s;omething that will better ju&s;|tify him to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> as well as to <HI>her,</HI> and to the <HI>world,</HI> than mere <HI>power</HI> and <HI>novelty?</HI></P>
<P>But I don't &s;ee, if we judge by <HI>fact,</HI> and by the <HI>practice</HI> of all we have been acquainted with, of the
<PB N="89" REF="96">
<HI>Keeping cla&s;s,</HI> that we know how to part with them when we have them.</P>
<P>That we know we <HI>can</HI> if we <HI>will,</HI> is all we have for <HI>it:</HI> And this leads us to bear many things from a <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> which we would not from a <HI>wife.</HI> But if we are good-natur'd and humane: If the woman has <HI>art</HI> [And what woman <HI>wants</HI> it, who has fallen by <HI>art?</HI> and to who&s;e precarious &s;ituation <HI>art</HI> is &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary?] If you have given her the credit of being called by your name: If you have a &s;ettled place of abode, and have received and paid vi&s;its in her com|pany, as your wife: If &s;he has brought you children; you will allow, that the&s;e are &s;trong obligations upon you, in the world's eye, as well as to your own heart, again&s;t tearing your&s;elf from &s;uch clo&s;e con|nexions. She will &s;tick to you as your &s;kin: And it will be next to flaying your&s;elf to ca&s;t her off.</P>
<P>Even if there be <HI>cau&s;e</HI> for it, by infidelity, &s;he will have managed ill, if &s;he have not her defenders&mdash;Nor did I ever know a cau&s;e, or a per&s;on, &s;o <HI>bad,</HI> as to want advocates, either from ill will to the one, or pity to the other; and you will then be thought a hard-hearted mi&s;creant: And even were &s;he to go off without credit to <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> &s;he will leave <HI>you</HI> as little; e&s;pecially with all tho&s;e who&s;e good opinion a man would wi&s;h to cultivate.</P>
<P>Well, then, &s;hall this poor privilege, that we may part with a woman, if we <HI>will,</HI> be deem'd a balance for the other inconveniencies? Shall it be thought by <HI>us,</HI> who are men of family and fortune, an equivalent for giving up equality of degree; and taking for the partner of our bed, and very probably more than the partner in our e&s;tates (to the breach of all family-rule and order), a low-born, a low-educated creature, who has not brought any-thing into the common &s;tock; and can po&s;&s;ibly make no returns for the &s;olid benefits &s;he receives, but tho&s;e libidinous ones, which
<PB N="90" REF="97">
a man cannot boa&s;t of, but to <HI>his</HI> di&s;grace, nor think of, but to the &s;hame of <HI>both?</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, as the man advances in years, the fury of his libertini&s;m will go off. He will have different aims and pur&s;uits, which will dimini&s;h his appetite to ranging, and make &s;uch a regular life as the matri|monial and family-life, palatable to him, and every day more palatable.</P>
<P>If he has children, and has rea&s;on to think them <HI>his,</HI> and if his lewd cour&s;es have left him any e&s;tate, he will have cau&s;e to regret the <HI>re&s;traint</HI> his boa&s;ted <HI>liberty</HI> has laid him under, and the valuable <HI>privilege</HI> it has deprived him of; when he finds, that it mu&s;t de&s;cend to &s;ome relation, for whom, whether near or di&s;tant, he cares not one farthing; and who, per|haps, from his di&s;&s;olute life, if a man of virtue, has held him in the utmo&s;t contempt.</P>
<P>And were we to &s;uppo&s;e his e&s;tate in his power to bequeath as he plea&s;es; why &s;hould a man re&s;olve, for the gratifying of his wicked humour only, to ba|&s;tardize his race? Why &s;hould he wi&s;h to expo&s;e them to the &s;corn and in&s;ults of the re&s;t of the world?&mdash;Why &s;hould he, whether they are men or women, lay them under the nece&s;&s;ity of complying with pro|po&s;als of marriage, either inferior as to fortune, or unequal as to age?&mdash;Why &s;hould he deprive the children he loves, and who are them&s;elves guilty of no fault (if they have regard to morals, and to legal and &s;ocial &s;anctions), of the re&s;pect they would wi&s;h to have, and to de&s;erve?&mdash;and of the opportunity of a&s;&s;ociating them&s;elves with proper, that is to &s;ay, with <HI>reputable</HI> company?&mdash;And why &s;hould he make them think them&s;elves under obligation to every per|&s;on of character, who &s;hould vouch&s;afe to vi&s;it them&punc; What little rea&s;on, in a word, would &s;uch children have to ble&s;s their father's ob&s;tinate defiance of the laws and cu&s;toms of his country; and for giving them
<PB N="91" REF="98">
a mother, whom they could not think of with ho|nour; to who&s;e <HI>crime</HI> it was, that they owed their very beings, and who&s;e example it was their duty to &s;hun?</P>
<P>If the education and morals of the&s;e children are left to chance, as too generally they are (for the man who has humanity and a feeling heart, and who is ca|pable of fondne&s;s for his offspring, I take it for granted, will marry); the ca&s;e is &s;till wor&s;e; his crime is perpetuated, as I may &s;ay, by his children: And the Sea, the Army, perhaps the Highway, for the boys; the Common for the girls; too often point out the way to a wor&s;e cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>What therefore, upon the whole, do we get by treading in the&s;e crooked paths, but danger, di&s;grace, and a too late repentance?</P>
<P>And after all, do we not frequently become the cullies of our own libertini&s;m; &s;liding into the very &s;tate with tho&s;e half-worn-out doxies; which, per|haps we might have enter'd into with their ladies; at lea&s;t with their &s;uperiors, both in degree and for|tune? And all the time, lived hand&s;omely like our|&s;elves; not &s;neaking into holes and corners; and, when we crept abroad with our women, looking about us at every opening into the &s;treet or day, as if we were confe&s;&s;edly accountable to the cen&s;ures of all hone&s;t people.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Tony Jenyns, thou knewe&s;t. He had not the actively mi&s;chievous &s;pirit, that Thou, Bel|ton, Mowbray, My&s;elf, and Tourville, have: But he imbibed the &s;ame notions we do, and carried them into practice.</P>
<P>How did he prate again&s;t wedlock! How did he &s;trut about as a <HI>wit</HI> and a <HI>&s;mart!</HI> And what a <HI>wit</HI> and a <HI>&s;mart</HI> did all the boys and girls of our family, my&s;elf among the re&s;t, then an urchin, think him, for the airs he gave him&s;elf?&mdash;Marry! No, not for the world; what man of &s;en&s;e would bear the in&s;olences,
<PB N="92" REF="99">
the petulances, the expen&s;ivene&s;s of a wife! He could not for the heart of him think it tolerable, that a wo|man of <HI>equal</HI> rank and fortune, and, as it might hap|pen, <HI>&s;uperior</HI> talents to his own, &s;hould look upon her&s;elf to have a right to &s;hare the benefit of that for|tune which &s;he brought him.</P>
<P>So, after he had flutter'd about the town for two or three years, in all which time he had a better opinion of him&s;elf than any-body el&s;e had, what does he do, but enter upon an affair with his fencing-ma&s;ter's daughter?</P>
<P>He &s;ucceeds, takes private lodgings for her at Hack|ney; vi&s;its her by &s;tealth, both of them tender of re|putations, that were <HI>extremely</HI> tender, but which nei|ther had quite given over; for rakes of either &s;ex are always the la&s;t to condemn or cry down them&s;elves: Vi&s;ited by nobody, nor vi&s;iting: The life of a thief, or of a man be&s;et by creditors, afraid to look out of his own hou&s;e, or to be &s;een abroad with her. And thus went he on for twelve years, and, tho' he had a good e&s;tate, hardly making both ends meet; for, tho' no glare, there was no oeconomy; and be&s;ides, he had every year a child, and very fond of them was he. But none of them lived above three years: And being now, on the death of the dozenth, grown as dully &s;ober, as if he had been a real hu&s;band, his good Mrs. Thomas (for he had not permitted her to take his own name) prevailed upon him, to think the lo&s;s of their children a judgment upon the parents for their wicked way of life [There is a time, when calamities will beget reflection! The royal cully of France, thou know|e&s;t, was <HI>Maintenon</HI>'d into it by his ill &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the field]: And &s;o, when more than half-worn out <HI>both</HI> of them, the &s;orry fellow took it into his head to marry her: And then had lei&s;ure to &s;it down, and contemplate the many offers of per&s;ons of family and fortune, which he had declined in the prime of his life: His ex|pences <HI>equal</HI> at lea&s;t: His reputation not only <HI>le&s;s,</HI> but <HI>lo&s;t:</HI> His enjoyments <HI>&s;tollen:</HI> His partner&s;hip <HI>unequal,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="100">
and &s;uch as he had always been a&s;hamed of. But the women &s;aid, That after twelve years cohabitation, Tony did an hone&s;t thing by her. And that was all my poor cou&s;in got by making his old mi&s;tre&s;s his new wife:&mdash;Not a drum, not a trumpet, not a fife, not a tabret, nor the expectation of a new joy, to ani|mate him on!</P>
<P>What Belton will do with his Thoma&s;ine, I know not; nor care I to advi&s;e him: For I &s;ee the poor fellow does not like that any-body &s;hould cur&s;e her but him&s;elf: And that he does very heartily. And &s;o low is he reduced, that he blubbers over the reflection upon his pa&s;t fondne&s;s for her cubs, and upon his pre&s;ent doubts of their being his:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'What a d&mdash;n'd thing is it, Belford, if Tom and Hall &s;hould be the ho&s;tler dog's puppies, and not mine!'</Q>
Very true! and I think the &s;trong health of the chubby-faced, mu&s;cular whelps, confirms the too great probability. But I &s;ay not &s;o to him.</P>
<P>You, he &s;ays, are &s;uch a gay, lively mortal, that this &s;ad tale would make no impre&s;&s;ion upon you: E&s;pecially now, that your whole heart is engaged as it is. Mowbray would be too violent upon it; he has not, he &s;ays, a feeling heart: Tourville has no di&s;cretion: And, a pretty je&s;t! although he and his Thoma&s;ine lived without reputation in the world (People gue&s;&s;ing that they were not married, notwith|&s;tanding &s;he went by his name); yet
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'he would not <HI>too much</HI> di&s;credit the <HI>cur&s;ed ingrate</HI> neither!'</Q>
&mdash;Could a man act a weaker part, had he been really married; and were he &s;ure he was going to &s;eparate from the mother of his own children?</P>
<P>I leave this as a le&s;&s;on upon thy heart, without making any application: Only, with this remark, That after we libertines have indulged our licentious appetites, reflecting in the conceit of our vain hearts, both with our lips and by our lives, upon our ance&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs, and the good old ways, we find out, when we
<PB N="94" REF="101">
come to years of di&s;cretion, if we live till then [what all who knew us found out before, that is to &s;ay, we find out] our own de&s;picable folly; that tho&s;e good old ways would have been be&s;t for <HI>us,</HI> as well as for the re&s;t of the world; and that in every &s;tep we have de|viated from them, we have only expo&s;ed our vanity and our ignorance at the &s;ame time.</P>

<P>I Am plea&s;ed with the &s;ober reflection thou con|clude&s;t thy la&s;t with; and I thank thee for it: Poor Belton!&mdash;I did not think his Thoma&s;ine would have proved &s;o very a devil.

<P>AND now will I favour thee with a brief account of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>From the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t we are all extremely happy.&mdash;<HI>Dorcas</HI> &s;tands well in her lady's graces. <HI>Polly</HI> has a&s;ked her advice in relation to a court&s;hip affair of her own. No oracle ever gave better. <HI>Sally</HI> has had a quarrel with her woollen-draper; and made my beloved Lady-chancellor in it. She blamed Sally for behaving tyrannically to a man who loves her. Dear creature! to &s;tand again&s;t a gla&s;s, and to &s;hut her eyes becau&s;e &s;he will not &s;ee her face in it!&mdash;Mrs. Sinclair has paid <HI>her</HI> court to &s;o unerr|ing a judge, by reque&s;ting her advice with regard to both nieces.</P>
<P>This the way we have been in for &s;everal days with the people below. Yet <HI>&s;ola</HI> generally at her meals,
<PB N="96" REF="103">
and &s;eldom at other times in their company. They now, u&s;ed to her ways [Per&s;everance mu&s;t conquer], never pre&s;s her; &s;o when they meet, all is civility on both &s;ides. Even marry'd people, I believe, Jack, prevent abundance of quarrels, by &s;eeing one another but &s;eldom.</P>
<P>But how &s;tands it between thy&s;elf and the lady, methinks thou a&s;ke&s;t, &s;ince her abrupt departure from thee, and undutiful repul&s;e of Wedne&s;day morning? Why, pretty well in the main. Nay, very well. For why? The dear &s;aucy-face knows not how to help her&s;elf. Can fly to no other protection. And has, be&s;ides, overheard a conver&s;ation [Who would have thought &s;he had been &s;o near?] which pa&s;&s;ed between Mrs. Sinclair, Mi&s;s Martin, and my&s;elf, that very Wedne&s;day afternoon; which has &s;et her heart at ea&s;e, with re&s;pect to &s;everal doubtful points.</P>
<P>Such as, particularly, Mrs. Fretchville's unhappy &s;tate of mind:&mdash;Mo&s;t humanely pitied by Mi&s;s Martin, who knows her very well; the hu&s;band &s;he has lo&s;t, and her&s;elf, lovers from their cradles. Pity from one begets pity from another; and &s;o many circum&s;tances were given to poor Mrs. Fretchville's di&s;tre&s;s, that it was impo&s;&s;ible but my beloved mu&s;t <HI>extremely</HI> pity her, whom the le&s;s tender-hearted Mi&s;s Martin <HI>greatly</HI> pitied.</P>

<P>My pa&s;&s;ion for my beloved, which I told them, is a high and fervent accent, was the true&s;t that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="97" REF="104">
could have for woman, I boa&s;ted of. It was, in &s;hort, I &s;aid, of the <HI>true Platonic kind</HI>; or I had no notion of what Platonic Love was.</P>
<P>So it is, Jack; and mu&s;t end as Platonic Love ge|nerally does end.</P>
<P>Sally and Mrs. Sinclair prai&s;ed, <HI>but not gro&s;ly,</HI> my beloved. Sally particularly admired her purity, called it exemplary; yet, to avoid &s;u&s;picion, expre&s;&s;ed her thoughts, that &s;he was-<HI>rather over-nice,</HI> if &s;he might pre&s;ume to &s;ay &s;o before me. But applauded me for the &s;trict ob&s;ervation I made of my vow.</P>
<P>I more freely blamed her re&s;erves to me; called her cruel; inveighed again&s;t her relations; doubted her love. Every favour I a&s;ked of her deny'd me. Yet my behaviour to her as pure and delicate when alone, as when before them. Hinted at &s;omething that had pa&s;&s;ed between us that very day, that &s;hewed her indifference to me in &s;o &s;trong a light, that I could not bear it. But that I would a&s;k her for her company to the play of <HI>Venice pre&s;erv'd,</HI> given out for Saturday night, as a benefit play; the prime actors to be in it; and this to &s;ee, if I were to be denied every favour.&mdash;Yet, for my own part, I loved not tra|gedies; tho' &s;he did, for the &s;ake of the in&s;truction, the warning, and the example generally given in them.</P>
<P>I had too much <HI>feeling,</HI> I &s;aid. There was enough in the world to make our hearts &s;ad, without carry|ing grief into our diver&s;ions, and making the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others our own.</P>
<P>True enough, Belford; and I believe, generally &s;peaking, that all the men of our ca&s;t are of my mind&mdash;They love not any tragedies but tho&s;e in which they them&s;elves act the parts of tyrants and executioners; and, afraid to tru&s;t them&s;elves with &s;erious and &s;olemn reflections, run to comedies, to laugh away the di|&s;tre&s;&s;es they have occa&s;ioned, and to find examples of
<PB N="98" REF="105">
as immoral men as them&s;elves. For very few of our comic performances, as thou knowe&s;t, give us good ones.&mdash;I an&s;wer, however, for my&s;elf&mdash;Yet thou, I think, on recollection, love&s;t to deal in the <HI>lamentable.</HI></P>
<P>Sally an&s;wered for Polly, who was ab&s;ent, Mrs. Sinclair for her&s;elf, and for all her acquaintance, even for Mi&s;s Partington, in preferring the comic to the tragic &s;cenes.&mdash;And I believe they are right; for the devil's in it, if a confided-in rake does not give a girl enough of tragedy in his comedy.</P>
<P>I a&s;k'd Sally to oblige my fair-one with her com|pany.</P>
<P>She was engaged [That was right, thou'lt &s;uppo&s;e]. I a&s;ked Mrs. Sinclair's leave for Polly. To be &s;ure, &s;he an&s;wer'd, Polly would think it an honour to at|tend Mrs. Lovelace: But the poor thing was tender-hearted; and as the tragedy was deep, would weep her&s;elf blind.</P>
<P>Sally, mean time, objected Singleton, that <HI>I</HI> might an&s;wer the objection, and &s;ave my beloved the trouble of making it, or debating the point with me.</P>
<P>I then, from a letter ju&s;t before received from one in her father's family, warned them of a per&s;on who had undertaken to find us out, and whom I thus in writing (calling for pen and ink) de&s;cribed, that they might arm all the family again&s;t him&mdash;

<P>No que&s;tions mu&s;t be an&s;wer'd, that he &s;hould a&s;k. They &s;hould call me to him. But not let my beloved know a tittle of this, &s;o long as it could be help'd. And I added, that if her brother or Singleton

<P>Mrs. Sinclair began to be afraid of mi&s;chief in her hou&s;e&mdash;I was apprehen&s;ive that &s;he would overdo the matter, and be out of character. I therefore wink'd at her. She primm'd; nodded, to &s;hew &s;he took me, twang'd out a high-ho, lapp'd one hor&s;e-lip over the other, and was &s;ilent.</P>

<P>The woes of others &s;o well repre&s;ented, as tho&s;e of Belvidera particularly will be, mu&s;t, I hope, unlock and open my charmer's heart.

I have no hope of &s;uch an effect here; but I have more than one end to an&s;wer, by my earne&s;tne&s;s in getting her to a play.

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Did not know, my dear, that you deferred giving an an&s;wer to Mr. Lovelace's propo&s;als, till you had my opinion of them. A particular hand occa|&s;ionally going to town, will leave this at Wil&s;on's, that no delay may be made on that account.</P>
<P>I never had any doubt of the man's ju&s;tice and ge|nero&s;ity in matters of &s;ettlement; and all his relations are as noble in their &s;pirits, as in their de&s;cent: But <HI>now,</HI> it may not be ami&s;s for you to wait, to &s;ee what returns my Lord makes to his letter of invitation.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme I think of is this.</P>
<P>There is a per&s;on (I believe you have &s;een her with me), one Mrs. Town&s;end, who is a great dealer in Indian &s;ilks, Bru&s;&s;els and French laces, cambricks, linen, and other valuable goods; which &s;he has a way of coming at, duty-free; and has a great vead for them, and for other curio&s;ities which &s;he imports, in the private families of the gentry round us.</P>
<P>She has her days of being in town, and then is at a chamber &s;he rents in an inn in Southwark, where &s;he has patterns of all her &s;ilks, and much of her port|able goods, for the conveniency of her London cu&s;|tomers. But her place of re&s;idence, and where &s;he has her principal warehou&s;e, is at Deptford, for the opportunity of getting her goods on &s;hore.</P>
<P>She was fir&s;t brought to me by my mother, to whom &s;he was recommended, on the &s;uppo&s;al of my &s;peedy
<PB N="104" REF="111">
marriage; that I might have an opportunity to be as fine as a prince&s;s, was my mamma's expre&s;&s;ion, at a moderate expence.</P>
<P>Now, my dear, I mu&s;t own, that I do not love to encourage the&s;e contraband traders. What is it, but bidding defiance to the laws of our country, when we do; and hurting fair traders; and at the &s;ame time robbing our Prince of his legal due, to the di|minution of tho&s;e duties which po&s;&s;ibly mu&s;t be made good by new levies upon the whole public?</P>
<P>But, however, Mrs. Town&s;end and I, though we have not yet dealt, are upon a very good foot of under|&s;tanding. She is a &s;en&s;ible woman; &s;he has been abroad, and often goes abroad, in the way of her bu|&s;ine&s;s; and gives very entertaining accounts of all &s;he has &s;een. And having applied to me, to recommend her to you (as it is her view to be known to young ladies, who are likely to change their condi|tion), I am &s;ure I can engage her to give you pro|tection at her hou&s;e at Deptford; which &s;he &s;ays is a populous village; and one of the la&s;t, I &s;hould think, that you would be &s;ought for in. She is not much there, you will believe, by the cour&s;e of her dealings; but, no doubt, mu&s;t have &s;omebody on the &s;pot, in whom &s;he can confide: And there perhaps you might be &s;afe, till your cou&s;in comes. And I &s;hould not think it ami&s;s, that you write to him out of hand. I cannot &s;ugge&s;t to you what you &s;hould write. That mu&s;t be left to your own di&s;cretion. For you will be afraid, no doubt, of the con&s;equence of a variance between the two men.</P>
<P>I will think further of this &s;cheme of mine, in re|lation to Mrs. Town&s;end, if you find it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould. But I hope there will be no occa&s;ion to do &s;o, &s;ince your pro&s;pects &s;eem to be changed, and that you have had <HI>twenty-four-not unhappy hours together.</HI> How my indignation ri&s;es for this poor con&s;olation in the court&s;hip (<HI>court&s;hip</HI> mu&s;t I call it?) of &s;uch a lady!</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="112">Mrs. Town&s;end, as I have recollected, has two brothers, each a ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el; and who knows, as &s;he and they have great concerns together, but that, in ca&s;e of need, you may have a whole &s;hip's crew at your devotion? If he give your cau&s;e to leave him, take no thought for the people at Harlowe-place. Let them take care of one another. It is a care they are <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to. The Law will help to &s;ecure them. The wretch is no a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; no night-murderer. He is an <HI>open,</HI> becau&s;e a <HI>fearle&s;s</HI> enemy; and &s;hould he attempt any thing that &s;hould make him obnoxious to the Laws of &s;ociety, you might have a fair riddance of him either by flight or the gallows; no matter which.</P>
<P>Had you not been &s;o minute in your account of the circum&s;tances that attended the opportunity you had of overhearing the dialogue between Mr. Lovelace and two of the women, I &s;hould have thought the conference contrived on purpo&s;e for your ears.</P>
<P>I &s;hew'd Mr. Lovelace's propo&s;als to Mr. Hick|man, who had chambers once at Lincoln's-Inn, be|ing de&s;igned for the Law, had his elder brother lived. He looked &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o proud, and &s;o important, upon the occa&s;ion; and wanted to take &s;o much con&s;idera|tion about them&mdash;would take them home if I plea&s;ed&mdash;and weigh them well&mdash;and &s;o-forth&mdash;and the like&mdash;and all that&mdash;that I had no patience with him, and &s;natched them back with anger.</P>

<P>Yes, zeal without knowlege, I &s;aid&mdash;like mo&s;t other zeals&mdash;If there were no objections that &s;truck him at once, there were none.</P>

<P>And &s;o <HI>&s;low,</HI> un-deare&s;t Sir, I could have &s;aid&mdash;But, SURELY, &s;aid I, with a look which imply'd, <HI>Would you rebel, Sir!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="113">He begged my pardon&mdash;<HI>Saw</HI> no objection, indeed!&mdash;But might he be allowed once more&mdash;</P>
<P>No matter&mdash;No matter&mdash;I would have &s;hewn them to my mother, I &s;aid, who, tho' of no Inn of Court, knew more of the&s;e things than half the lounging lub|bers of them; and that at fir&s;t &s;ight&mdash;only that &s;he would have been provoking upon the confe&s;&s;ion of our continued corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>But, my dear, let the articles be drawn up, and ingro&s;&s;ed; and &s;olemnize upon them; and there's no more to be &s;aid.</P>
<P>Let me add, that the &s;ailor fellow has been tamper|ing with my Kitty, and offered a bribe, to find where to direct to you. Next time he comes, I will have him drawn through one of our deepe&s;t fi&s;h-ponds, if I can get nothing out of him. His attempt to corrupt a &s;er|vant of mine will ju&s;tify my orders.</P>
<P>I &s;end this away directly. But will follow it by another; which &s;hall have for its &s;ubject only my Mother, My&s;elf, and your uncle Antony. And as your pro&s;pects are more promi&s;ing than they have been, I will endeavour to make you &s;mile upon this occa&s;ion.

<P>NOW, my dear, for the promi&s;ed &s;ubject. You mu&s;t not a&s;k me, how I came by the <HI>originals</HI> (&s;uch they really are) that I am going to pre&s;ent you with: For my mamma would not read to me tho&s;e

parts of your uncle's letter, which bore hard upon my&s;elf, and which leave him without any title to mercy from me: Nor would &s;he let me hear but what &s;he plea&s;ed of hers in an&s;wer; for &s;he has con|de&s;cended to an&s;wer him; with a denial, however:&mdash;But &s;uch a denial, as no-one but an <HI>old batchelor</HI> would take from a widow.</P>
<P>Any-body, except my&s;elf, who could have been acquainted with &s;uch a fal-lal court&s;hip as this mu&s;t have been had it proceeded, would have been glad it had gone on; and I dare &s;ay, but for the &s;aucy daughter, it had. My mamma, in that ca&s;e, would have been ten years the younger for it, perhaps: And could I but have approved of it, I &s;hould have been con&s;idered as if ten years older than I am: Since, very likely, it would then have been:

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, May</HI> 15.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Did make a &s;ort of re&s;olution ten years ago, never to marry. I &s;aw in other families, where they lived <HI>be&s;t,</HI> you'll be plea&s;ed to mark that, <HI>queerne&s;&s;es</HI> I could not away with. Then, liked well enough to live &s;ingle for &s;ake of my brother's family; and for one child in it, more than the re&s;t. But that girl has turned us all off of the hinges: And why I &s;hould deny my&s;elf any comforts for them as will not thank me for &s;o doing, I don't know.</P>
<P>So much for my motives, as from &s;elf and family: But the dear Mrs. Howe makes me go further.</P>
<P>I have a very great fortune, I ble&s;s God for it, all of my own getting, or <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of it; you'll be plea&s;ed to mark that; for I was the younger brother of three. You have al&s;o, God be thanked, a great e&s;tate, which you have improved by your own frugality and wi&s;e management. Frugality, let me &s;top to &s;ay, is one of the greate&s;t virtues in this mortal life, becau&s;e it enables us to do ju&s;tice to <HI>all,</HI> and puts it in our power to benefit <HI>&s;ome</HI> by it, as we &s;ee they <HI>de&s;erve.</HI></P>
<P>You have but one child; and I am a batchelor, and have never a one.&mdash;All batchelors cannot &s;ay &s;o: Wherefore your daughter may be the better for me,
<PB N="109" REF="116">
if &s;he will keep up with my humour; which was never thought bad: E&s;pecially to my equals. Servants, in|deed, I don't matter being angry with, when I plea&s;e: They are paid for bearing it, and too-too often de|&s;erve it; as we have very frequently taken notice of to one another. But this won't hurt neither you nor Mi&s;s.</P>
<P>I will make very advantageous &s;ettlements; &s;uch as any common friend &s;hall judge to be &s;o. But mu&s;t have all in my own power, while I live: Becau&s;e, you know, Madam, it is as creditable to the wife, as the hu&s;band, that it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>I aim not at fine words. We are not children; tho' it is hoped we may have &s;ome; for I am a very healthy &s;ound man, I ble&s;s God for it: And never brought home from my voyages and travels, a wor&s;er con&s;titution than I took out with me. I was none of tho&s;e, I will a&s;&s;ure you. But this I will undertake, that if you are the &s;urvivre&s;s, you &s;hall be at <HI>the lea&s;t</HI> ten thou&s;and pounds the better for me: What, in the contrary ca&s;e, I &s;hall be the better for you, I leave to you, as you &s;hall think my kindne&s;s to you &s;hall de|&s;erve.</P>
<P>But one thing, Madam, I &s;hould be glad of, that Mi&s;s Howe might not live with us then (She need not know I write thus)&mdash;But go home to Mr. Hickman, as &s;he is upon the point of marriage, I hear. And if &s;he behaves dutifully, as &s;he &s;hould do, to us both, &s;he &s;hall be the better; for &s;o I &s;aid before.</P>
<P>You &s;hall manage all things, both mine and your own; for I know little of land-matters. All my op|po&s;ition to you &s;hall be out of love, when I think you take too much upon you for your health.</P>
<P>It will be very pretty for you, I &s;hould think, to have a man of experience, in a long winter's evening, to &s;it down and tell you &s;tories of foreign parts, and the cu&s;toms of the nations he has con&s;orted with. And I have fine curio&s;ities of the Indian growth; &s;uch as
<PB N="110" REF="117">
ladies love, and &s;ome that even my niece Clary, when &s;he was good, never &s;aw. The&s;e, one by one, as you are kind to me (which I make no que&s;tion of, becau&s;e I &s;hall be kind to you) &s;hall all be yours.&mdash;Prettier en|tertainment by much, than &s;itting with a too &s;marti&s;h daughter, &s;ometimes out of humour, and thwarting, and vexing, as daughters will, when women-grown e&s;pecially (as I have heard you often ob&s;erve); and thinking their parents old, without paying them the reverence due to years; when, as in your ca&s;e, I make no &s;ort of doubt, they are young enough to wipe their no&s;es. You under&s;tand me, Madam.</P>
<P>As for me my&s;elf, it will be very happy, and I am delighted with the thinking of it, to have, after a plea&s;ant ride, or &s;o, a lady of like experience with my|&s;elf, to come home to, and but one intere&s;t betwixt us: To reckon up our comings-in together; and what this day and this week has produced:&mdash;O how this will increa&s;e love!&mdash;Mo&s;t mightily will it increa&s;e it!&mdash;And I believe I &s;hould never love you enough or be able to &s;hew you all my love.</P>

<P>And now, which &s;hall I fir&s;t give you; the an&s;wer of my mamma; or, the dialogue that pa&s;&s;ed between the widow-mother and the pert daughter, upon her letting the latter know that &s;he had a letter?</P>
<P>I <HI>think</HI> you &s;hall have the <HI>dialogue.</HI> But let me premi&s;e one thing; that if you <HI>think</HI> me too free, you mu&s;t not let it run in your head, that I am writing of <HI>your</HI> uncle, or of <HI>my</HI> mother: But of a couple of old lovers, no matter whom.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, May</HI> 19.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Mr. Antony Harlowe, SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not u&s;ual, I believe, for our Sex to an&s;wer by pen and ink, the fir&s;t letter on the&s;e occa&s;ions. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> letter!&mdash;How odd is that!&mdash;As if I ex|pected another; which I do not.&mdash;But then, I think, as I do not judge proper to encourage your propo&s;al, there is no rea&s;on why I &s;hould not an&s;wer in civility, where &s;o great a civility is intended. Indeed I was always of opinion, that a per&s;on was intitled to That, and not to ill-u&s;age, becau&s;e he had a re&s;pect for me. And &s;o I have often and often told my daughter.</P>
<P>A woman, I think, makes but a poor figure in a man's eye afterwards, and does no reputation to her Sex neither, when &s;he behaves like a tyrant to him beforehand.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Sir, if I were to change my condition, I know not a gentleman who&s;e propo&s;al could be more agreeable. Your nephew and nieces have enough without you: My daughter is a fine fortune without me, and I &s;hould take care to double it, living or dy|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng, were I to do &s;uch a thing: So nobody need to be the wor&s;e for it. But Nancy would not think &s;o.</P>
<P>All the comfort I know of in children, is, that when young they do with us what they will, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s pretty in them to their very faults; and when they are grown up, they think their parents mu&s;t live for
<PB N="122" REF="129">
them only; and deny them&s;elves every thing for their &s;akes. I know Nancy could not bear a father-in-law. She would fly at the very thought of my being in earne&s;t to give her one. Not that I &s;tand in fear of my daughter neither: It is not fit I &s;hould. But &s;he has her poor papa's &s;pirit: A very violent one, that was&mdash;And one would not choo&s;e, you know, Sir, to enter into any affair, that, one knows, one mu&s;t renounce a daughter for, or &s;he a mother.&mdash;Except indeed one's heart were much in it;&mdash;which, I ble&s;s God, mine is not.</P>
<P>I have now been a widow the&s;e ten years; nobody to controul me:&mdash;And I am &s;aid not to bear controul: So, Sir, you and I are be&s;t as we are, I believe&mdash;nay, I am &s;ure of it&mdash;For we want not what either has;&mdash;having both more than we know what to do with. And I know I could not be in the lea&s;t accountable for any of my ways.</P>
<P>My daughter indeed, tho' &s;he is a fine girl, as girls go [She has too much &s;en&s;e indeed for her &s;ex; and knows &s;he has it], is more a check to me than one would wi&s;h a daughter to be&mdash;For one would not be always &s;napping at each other: But &s;he will &s;oon be married; and then, not living together, we &s;hall only come together when we are plea&s;ed, and &s;tay away when we are not; and &s;o, like other lovers, never &s;ee any thing but the be&s;t &s;ides of each other.</P>
<P>I own, for all this, that I love her dearly; and &s;he me, I dare &s;ay. So would not wi&s;h to provoke her to do otherwi&s;e. Be&s;ides, the girl is &s;o much regarded every-where, that having lived &s;o much of my prime a widow, I would not lay my&s;elf open to her cen&s;ures, or even to her indifference, you know.</P>
<P>Your generous propo&s;al requires all this explicit|ne&s;s. I thank you for your good opinion of me. When I know you acquie&s;ce with This my civil re|fu&s;al; and indeed, Sir, I am as much in earne&s;t in it, as if I had &s;poke broader; I don't know, but Nancy
<PB N="123" REF="130">
and I may, with your permi&s;&s;ion, come to &s;ee your fine things; for I am a great admirer of rarities that come from abroad.</P>
<P>So, Sir, let us only conver&s;e occa&s;ionally as we meet, as we u&s;ed to do, without any other view to each other, than good wi&s;hes: Which I hope may not be le&s;&s;en'd for this declining. And then I &s;hall always think my&s;elf</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM too much di&s;turbed in my mind, to think of any think but revenge; or I had intended to give thee an account of Mi&s;s Harlowe's curious ob&s;ervations on the play. <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe's,</HI> I &s;ay. Thou knowe&s;t that I hate the name of <HI>Harlowe</HI>; and I am exceed|ingly out of humour with her, and with her &s;aucy friend.</P>
<P>What's the matter <HI>now,</HI> thou'lt a&s;k?&mdash;Matter enough; for while we were at the play, Dorcas, who had her orders, and a key to her lady's chamber, as well as a ma&s;ter-key to her drawers and mahogany che&s;t, clo&s;et-key and all, found means to come at &s;ome of Mi&s;s Howe's la&s;t-written letters. The vigilant wench was directed to them by &s;eeing her lady take a letter out of her &s;tays, and put it to the others, before &s;he went out with me&mdash;Afraid, as the women up|braidingly tell me, that I &s;hould find it there.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="131">Dorcas no &s;ooner found them, than &s;he a&s;&s;embled three ready writers of the <HI>non-apparents,</HI> and Sally, and &s;he and they employed them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t diligence, in making extracts, according to former directions, from the&s;e cur&s;ed letters, for my u&s;e. <HI>Cur&s;ed,</HI> I may well call them&mdash;Such abu&s;es, &s;uch virulence! O this little fury Mi&s;s Howe!&mdash;Well might her &s;aucy friend (who has been equally free with me, or the occa&s;ion could not have been given) be &s;o violent as &s;he lately was, at my endeavouring to come at one of the&s;e letters.</P>
<P>I was &s;ure, that this fair-one, at &s;o early an age, with a con&s;titution &s;o firm, health &s;o blooming, eyes &s;o &s;parkling, could not be ab&s;olutely, and from her own vigilance, &s;o guarded and &s;o apprehen&s;ive, as I have found her to be.&mdash;Sparkling eyes, Jack, when the poetical tribe have &s;aid all they can for them, are an infallible &s;ign of a rogue, or room for a rogue, in the heart.</P>
<P>Thou may'&s;t go on with thy preachments, and Lord M. with his Wi&s;dom of nations, I am now more a&s;&s;ured of her than ever. And now my revenge is up, and join'd with my love, all re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t fall before it. And mo&s;t &s;olemnly do I &s;wear, that Mi&s;s Howe &s;hall come in for her &s;nack.</P>
<P>And here, ju&s;t now, is another letter brought from the &s;ame little virulent devil.&mdash;I hope to procure tran|&s;cripts from that too, very &s;peedily, if it be put to the re&s;t; for the &s;aucy lady is re&s;olved to go to church this morning; not &s;o much from a &s;pirit of devotion, I have rea&s;on to think, as to try whether &s;he can go out without check or controul, or my attendance.</P>
<P>I HAVE been denied breakfa&s;ting with her. In|deed &s;he was a little di&s;plea&s;ed with me la&s;t night; becau&s;e, on our return from the play, I obliged her to pa&s;s the re&s;t of the night with the women and me, in their parlour, and to &s;tay till near One. She told
<PB N="125" REF="132">
me at parting, that &s;he expected to have the whole next day to her&s;elf.&mdash;I had not read the extracts then; &s;o was all affectionate re&s;pect, awe, and di|&s;tance; for I had re&s;olved to begin a new cour&s;e, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to bani&s;h all jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion from her heart: And yet I had no rea&s;on to be much troubled at her pa&s;t &s;u&s;picions; &s;ince, if a woman will continue with a man whom &s;he &s;u&s;pects, when &s;he can get from him, or <HI>thinks</HI> &s;he can, I am &s;ure it is a very hopeful &s;ign.</P>
<P>SHE is gone. Slipt down before I was aware. She had ordered a chair, on purpo&s;e to exclude my per|&s;onal attendance. But I had taken proper precau|tions. Will. attended her by con&s;ent; Peter, the hou&s;e-&s;ervant, was within Will.'s call.</P>
<P>I had, by Dorcas, repre&s;ented her danger from Single|ton, in order to di&s;&s;uade her from going at all, unle&s;s &s;he allowed me to attend her; but I was an&s;wer'd, That if there was no cau&s;e of fear at the playhou&s;e, when there were but <HI>two</HI> playhou&s;es, &s;urely there was le&s;s at church, when there were &s;o <HI>many</HI> churches. The chairmen were ordered to carry her to St. James's church.</P>
<P>But &s;he would not be &s;o carele&s;s of obliging me, if &s;he knew what I have already come at, and how the women urge me on; for they are continually com|plaining of the re&s;traint they lie under; in their be|haviour; in their attendance; neglecting all their con|cerns in the front-hou&s;e; and keeping this elegant back one intirely free from company, that &s;he may have no &s;u&s;picion of them. They doubt not my genero&s;ity, they &s;ay: But <HI>why</HI> for my own &s;ake, in Lord M.'s &s;tyle, <HI>&s;hould I make &s;o long a harve&s;t of &s;o little corn?</HI>&mdash;Women, ye rea&s;on well. I think I will begin my operations the moment &s;he comes in.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="133">I HAVE come at the letter brought her from Mi&s;s Howe to-day.&mdash;Plot, conjuration, &s;orcery, witch|craft, all going forward!&mdash;I &s;hall not be able to &s;ee this <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe</HI> with patience.

<P>SHE is returned&mdash;But refu&s;es to admit me. De&s;ires to have the day to her&s;elf. Dorcas tells me, that &s;he believes her denial is from motives of piety&mdash;Oons, Jack, is there impiety in &s;eeing me!&mdash;Would it not be the highe&s;t act of piety, to reclaim me?

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday morning,</HI> 7, <HI>May</HI> 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Was at the play la&s;t night with Mr. Lovelace and Mi&s;s Horton. It is, you know, a deep and mo&s;t affecting tragedy in the reading. You have my remarks upon it, in the little book you made me write upon the principal acting plays. You will not won|der, that Mi&s;s Horton, as well as I, was greatly moved at the repre&s;entation, when I tell you, and have &s;ome plea&s;ure in telling you, that Mr. Lovelace him&s;elf was very &s;en&s;ibly touched with &s;ome of the mo&s;t affecting &s;cenes. I mention this in prai&s;e of the author's per|formance; for I take Mr. Lovelace to be one of the mo&s;t hard-hearted men in the world. Upon my word, my dear, I do.</P>
<P>His behaviour, however, on this occa&s;ion, and on our return, was unexceptionable, only that he would oblige me to &s;tay to &s;upper with the women be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow, when we came back, and to &s;it up with him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd them till near one o'clock this morning. I was re&s;olved to be even with him; and indeed I am not
<PB N="138" REF="145">
very &s;orry to have the pretence; for I love to pa&s;s the Sundays by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>To have the better excu&s;e to avoid his teazing, I am ready dre&s;&s;ed to go to church this morning. I will go only to St. James's church, and in a <HI>chair</HI>; that I may be &s;ure I can go out and come in when I plea&s;e, without being obtruded upon by him, as I was twice before.</P>

<P>I HAVE your kind letter of ye&s;terday. He knows I have. And I &s;hall expect, that he will be inqui&s;i|tive next time I &s;ee him after your opinion of his pro|po&s;als. I doubted not your approbation of them, and had written an an&s;wer on that pre&s;umption; which is ready for him. He mu&s;t &s;tudy for occa&s;ions of pro|cra&s;tination, and to di&s;oblige me, if now any thing happens to &s;et us at variance again.</P>
<P>He is very importunate to &s;ee me; he has de&s;ired to attend me to church. He is angry, that I have de|clined to breakfa&s;t with him. I was &s;ure that I &s;hould not be at my own liberty, if I had.&mdash;I bid Dorcas tell him, that I de&s;ired to have this day to my&s;elf; I would &s;ee him in the morning, as early as he plea&s;ed. She &s;ays, &s;he knows not what ails him, but that he is out of humour with every-body.</P>
<P>He has &s;ent again, in a peremptory manner. He warns me of Singleton. But &s;urely, I &s;ent him word, if he was not afraid of Singleton at the play-hou&s;e la&s;t night, I need not at church to day: So many churches to one play-hou&s;e.&mdash;I have accepted of his &s;ervant's propo&s;ed attendance.&mdash;But he is quite di&s;|plea&s;ed, it &s;eems. I don't care. I will not be per|petually at his in&s;olent beck.&mdash;Adieu, my dear, til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I return. The chair waits. He won't &s;top me, &s;ure as I go down to it.</P>
<P>I DID not &s;ee him as I went down. He is, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eems, exce&s;&s;ively out of humour. Dorcas &s;ays, N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="139" REF="146">
with me neither, &s;he believes: But &s;omething has vex'd him. This is put on, perhaps, to make me dine with him. But I won't, if I can help it. I &s;han't get rid of him for the re&s;t of the day, if I do.</P>
<P>HE was very earne&s;t to dine with me. But I was re&s;olved to carry this one &s;mall point; and &s;o denied to dine my&s;elf. And indeed I was endeavouring to write to my cou&s;in Morden; and had begun three different letters, without being able to plea&s;e my&s;elf; &s;o uncertain and &s;o unplea&s;ing is my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>He was very bu&s;y in writing, Dorcas &s;ays, and pur|&s;ued it without dining, becau&s;e I denied him my com|pany.</P>
<P>He afterwards <HI>demanded,</HI> as I may &s;ay, to be ad|mitted to afternoon tea with me: And appealed by Dorcas to his behaviour to me la&s;t night; as if, as I &s;ent him word by her, he thought he had a merit in being unexceptionable. However, I repeated my promi&s;e to meet him as early as he plea&s;ed in the morning, or to breakfa&s;t with him.</P>
<P>Dorcas &s;ays, he raved. I heard him loud, and I heard his &s;ervant fly from him, as I thought. You, my deare&s;t friend, &s;ay, in one of yours <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> III. <HI>Letter</HI> lxix. <HI>p.</HI> 332.</NOTE>, that you mu&s;t have &s;omebody to be angry at, when your mo|ther &s;ets you up.&mdash;I &s;hould be very loth to draw com|pari&s;ons.&mdash;But the workings of pa&s;&s;ion, when indulg'd, are but too much alike, whether in man or woman.</P>
<P>HE has ju&s;t &s;ent me word, that he in&s;i&s;ts upon &s;up|ping with me. As we had been in a good train for &s;e|veral days pa&s;t, I thought it not prudent to break with him, for little matters. Yet, to be, in a manner, threaten'd into his will, I know not how to bear that.</P>
<P>WHILE I was con&s;idering, he came up, and, tapping at my door, told me, in a very angry tone, he mu&s;t &s;ee
<PB N="140" REF="147">
me this night. He could not re&s;t, till he had been told what he had done to de&s;erve this treatment.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t go to him. Yet perhaps he has nothing new to &s;ay to me.&mdash;I &s;hall be very angry with him.</P>

<P>'Tis hard, an&s;wered the fair Perver&s;e, that I am to be &s;o little my own mi&s;tre&s;s. I will meet you in the dining-room half an hour hence.</P>
<P>I went down to wait that half-hour. All the wo|men &s;et me hard to give her cau&s;e for this tyranny. They demon&s;trated, as well from the nature of the <HI>&s;ex,</HI> as of the <HI>ca&s;e,</HI> that I had nothing to hope for from my tamene&s;s, and could meet with no wor&s;e treat|ment, were I to be guilty of the la&s;t offence. They urged me vehemently to <HI>try</HI> at lea&s;t what effect &s;ome greater familiarities, than I had ever u&s;ed with her, would have: And their arguments being &s;trengthened by my ju&s;t re&s;entments on the di&s;coveries I had made, I was re&s;olved to take &s;ome liberties, and, as they were received, to take &s;till greater, and lay all the fault upon her tyranny. In this humour I went up, and never had paralytic &s;o little command of his joints, as I had, as I walked about the dining-room, attending her motions.</P>
<P>With an erect mien &s;he enter'd, her face averted, her lovely bo&s;om &s;welling, and the more charmingly protuberant for the erectne&s;s of her mien. O Jack! that &s;ullenne&s;s and re&s;erve &s;hould give this haughty maid new charms!

Surely this is an angel, Jack!&mdash;And yet, had &s;he not been known to be a female, they would not from <HI>babyhood</HI> have dre&s;&s;ed her as &s;uch, nor would &s;he, but upon that conviction, have continued the dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k you, Madam, I be&s;eech you tell me, what I have done to de&s;erve this di&s;tant treatment?</P>
<P>And let me a&s;k you, Mr. Lovelace, why are my retirements to be thus invaded?&mdash;What can you have to &s;ay to me &s;ince la&s;t night, that I went with you &s;o much again&s;t my will to the play? And after &s;itting up with you, equally again&s;t my will, till a very late hour?&mdash;</P>

<P>NO genero&s;ity in this lady. None at all. Would&s;t thou not have thought, that after I had per|mitted her to withdraw, primed for mi&s;chief as I was, that &s;he would meet me next morning early; and that with a &s;mile; making me one of her be&s;t cour|te&s;ies?</P>
<P>I was in the dining-room before &s;ix, expecting her. She opened not her door. I went up-&s;tairs and down, and hemm'd, and called Will. called Dorcas: Threw the doors hard to; but &s;till &s;he opened not her door. Thus till half an hour after eight, fooled I away my time; and then, breakfa&s;t ready, I &s;ent Dorcas to re|que&s;t her company.</P>
<P>But I was a&s;toni&s;hed, when, following the wench at the fir&s;t invitation, I &s;aw her enter dre&s;&s;ed, all but her gloves, and tho&s;e and her fan in her hand; in the
<PB N="146" REF="153">
&s;ame moment, bidding Dorcas direct Will. to get her a chair to the door.</P>
<P>Cruel creature, thought I, to expo&s;e me thus to the deri&s;ion of the women below!</P>
<P>Going abroad, Madam?</P>
<P>I am, Sir.</P>
<P>I looked cur&s;ed &s;illy, I am &s;ure.&mdash;You will break|fa&s;t fir&s;t, I hope, Madam, in a very humble &s;train: Yet with an hundred tenter-hooks in my heart.</P>
<P>Had &s;he given me more notice of her intention, I had perhaps wrought my&s;elf up to the frame I was in the day before, and begun my vengeance. And im|mediately came into my head all the virulence that had been tran&s;cribed for me from Mi&s;s Howe's let|ters, and in that I had tran&s;cribed my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;he would drink one di&s;h; and then laid her gloves and fan in the window ju&s;t by.</P>
<P>I was perfectly di&s;concerted. I hemm'd and haw'd, and was going to &s;peak &s;everal times; but knew not in what key. Who's mode&s;t now, thought I! Who's in&s;olent now!&mdash;How a tyrant of a woman confounds a ba&s;hful man!&mdash;She was my Mi&s;s Howe, I thought; and I the &s;piritle&s;s Hickman.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, I <HI>will</HI> begin, thought I.</P>
<P>She a di&s;h&mdash;I a di&s;h.</P>
<P>Sip, her eyes her own, &s;he; like an haughty and imperious &s;overeign, con&s;cious of dignity, every look a favour.</P>
<P>Sip, like her va&s;&s;al, I; lips and hands trembling, and not knowing that I &s;ipp'd or ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>I was&mdash;I was&mdash;Iffp'd&mdash;drawing in my breath and the liquor together, tho' I &s;calded my mouth with it&mdash;I was in hopes, Madam&mdash;</P>

<P>This &s;tartled her. She did not care to have me think hardly of Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>But recollecting her&s;elf, Mi&s;s Howe, &s;aid &s;he, is a friend to virtue, and to good men.&mdash;If &s;he like not you, it is becau&s;e you are not one of tho&s;e.</P>

<P>Whither will this lead us? replied &s;he. Mi&s;s Howe is ju&s;t; Mi&s;s Howe is good.&mdash;She writes, &s;he &s;peaks, of every-body as they de&s;erve.

<P>Devili&s;h &s;evere! And as indelicate as &s;evere, to put a mode&s;t man upon hunting backward after his own merits.</P>
<P>She would have flung from me: I <HI>will</HI> go out, Mr. Lovelace. I will <HI>not</HI> be detained.</P>
<P>Indeed you mu&s;t not, Madam, in this humour. And I placed my&s;elf between her and the door.&mdash;And then &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair, fanning her|&s;elf, her &s;weet face all crim&s;oned over with pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>I trembled between admiration and love; and wrapt my arms about her knees, as &s;he &s;at.

<P>Dear creature!&mdash;Did &s;he never romp? Did &s;he never from girlhood to now, hoyden? The <HI>innocent</HI> kinds of freedom taken and all owed on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, would have familiarized her to greater. Sacri|lege

<P>MY beloved not yet vi&s;ible. She is not well. What <HI>expectations</HI> had &s;he from my ardent admira|tion
<PB N="151" REF="158">
of her!&mdash;More rudene&s;s than revenge appre|hended. Yet, how my &s;oul thir&s;ts for revenge upon both the&s;e ladies!&mdash;I mu&s;t have recour&s;e to my ma&s;ter|&s;trokes. This cur&s;ed project of Mi&s;s Howe and her Mrs. Town&s;end, if I cannot contrive to render it abortive, will be always a &s;word hanging over my head. Upon every little di&s;obligation my beloved will be for taking wing; and the pains I have taken, to deprive her of every other refuge or protection, in order to make her ab&s;olutely dependent upon me, will be all thrown away. But, perhaps, I &s;hall find out a Smuggler to counteract Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>Thou remembre&s;t the contention between the Sun and the North wind, in the fable; which &s;hould fir&s;t make an hone&s;t Traveller throw off his cloak.</P>
<P>Boreas began fir&s;t. He puffed away mo&s;t vehe|mently; and often made the poor fellow curve and &s;tagger: But with no other effect, than to cau&s;e him to wrap his &s;urtout the clo&s;er about him.</P>
<P>But when it came to Phoebus's turn, he &s;o played upon the traveller with his beams, that he made him fir&s;t unbutton, and then throw it quite off:&mdash;Nor left he, till he obliged him to take to the friendly &s;hade of a &s;preading beech; where pro&s;trating him&s;elf on the thrown-off cloak, he took a comfortable nap.</P>
<P>The victor-god then laughed outright, both at Bo|reas and the Traveller, and pur&s;ued his radiant cour&s;e, &s;hining upon, and warming and cheri&s;hing a thou&s;and new objects, as he danced along: And at night, when he put up his fiery cour&s;ers, he diverted his Thetis with the relation of his pranks in the pa&s;&s;ed day.</P>
<P>I, in like manner, will di&s;card all my boi&s;trous inventions; and if I can oblige my &s;weet Traveller to throw a&s;ide, but for one moment, the cloak of her rigid virtue, I &s;hall have nothing to do, but, like the Sun, to ble&s;s new objects with my rays.&mdash;But my cho&s;en hours of conver&s;ation and repo&s;e, after all my peregrinations, will be devoted to my godde&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="159">AND now, Belford, according to my new &s;y&s;tem, I think this hou&s;e of Mrs. Fretchville an emba|ra&s;s upon me. I will get rid of it; for &s;ome time at lea&s;t. Mennell, when I am out, &s;hall come to her, inquiring for me. What for? thou'lt ask. What for!&mdash;Ha&s;t thou not heard what has befallen poor Mrs. Fretchville?&mdash;Then I'll tell thee.</P>
<P>One of her maids, about a week ago, was taken with the &s;mall-pox. The re&s;t-kept their mi&s;tre&s;s ignorant of it till Friday; and <HI>then</HI> &s;he came to know it by accident.&mdash;The greater half of the plagues poor mortals of condition are tormented with, proceed from the &s;ervants they take, partly for &s;hew, partly for u&s;e, and with a view to le&s;&s;en their cares.</P>
<P>This has &s;o terrified the widow, that &s;he is taken with all the &s;ymptoms which threaten an attack from that dreadful enemy of fair faces.&mdash;So mu&s;t not think of removing: Yet cannot expect, that we &s;hould be further delayed on her account.</P>
<P>She now wi&s;hes, with all her heart, that &s;he had known her own mind, and gone into the country at fir&s;t when I treated about the hou&s;e: This evil then had not happened!&mdash;A cur&s;ed cro&s;s accident for <HI>us,</HI> too!&mdash;High-ho! Nothing el&s;e, I think, in this mortal life!&mdash;People need not &s;tudy to bring cro&s;&s;es upon them&s;elves by their petulancies.</P>
<P>So this affair of the hou&s;e will be over; at lea&s;t, for one while. But then I can fall upon an expedient which will make amends for this di&s;appointment. Since I mu&s;t move <HI>&s;low,</HI> in order to be <HI>&s;ure,</HI> I have a charming contrivance or two in my head&mdash;Even &s;up|po&s;ing &s;he &s;hould get away, to bring her back again.</P>
<P>But what is become of Lord M. I trow, that he writes not to me, in an&s;wer to my invitation? If he would &s;end me &s;uch a letter, as I could &s;hew, it might go a great way towards a perfect reconciliation. I have written to Charlotte about it. He &s;hall &s;oon
<PB N="153" REF="160">
hear from me, and that in a way he won't like, if he writes not quickly. He has &s;ometimes threatened to di&s;inherit <HI>me:</HI> But if I &s;hould renounce <HI>him,</HI> it would be but ju&s;tice, and would vex him ten times more, than any thing he can do, will vex me. Then, the &s;ettlements unavoidably delayed, by his neglect!&mdash;How &s;hall I bear &s;uch a life of procra&s;tination! I, who, as to my will, and impatience, and &s;o forth, am of the true <HI>lady-make!</HI> and can as little bear con|troul and di&s;appointment as the be&s;t of them!</P>
<P>ANOTHER letter from Mi&s;s Howe. I &s;uppo&s;e it is <HI>that</HI> which &s;he promi&s;es in her la&s;t to &s;end her, relate|ing to the court&s;hip between old Tony the uncle, and Annabella the mother. I &s;hould be extremely re|joiced to &s;ee it. No more of the &s;muggler-plot in it, I hope. This, it &s;eems, &s;he has put in her pocket. But I hope I &s;hall &s;oon find it depo&s;ited with the re&s;t.</P>

<P>AT my repeated reque&s;t &s;he conde&s;cended to meet me in the dining-room to afternoon tea, and not be|fore.</P>
<P>She entered with ba&s;hfulne&s;s, as I thought; in a pretty confu&s;ion, for having carried her apprehen&s;ions too far. Sullen and &s;low moved &s;he towards the tea|table.&mdash;Dorcas pre&s;ent, bu&s;y in tea cup preparations. I took her reluctant hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to my lips.&mdash;Deare&s;t, lovelie&s;t of creatures, why this di&s;tance? Why this di&s;plea&s;ure?&mdash;How can you thus torture the faithfulle&s;t heart in the world?&mdash;She di&s;engaged her hand. Again I would have &s;natch'd it.</P>
<P>Be quiet, peevi&s;hly withdrawing it; and down &s;he &s;at; a gentle palpitation in the beauty of beauties in|dicating mingled &s;ullenne&s;s and re&s;entment; her &s;nowy handkerchief ri&s;ing and falling, and a &s;weet flu&s;h over&s;preading her charming cheeks.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="161">For God's &s;ake, Madam!&mdash;And a third time I would have taken her repul&s;ing hand.</P>
<P>And for the &s;ame &s;ake, Sir; no more teazing.</P>
<P>Dorcas retired; I drew my chair nearer hers, and with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful tenderne&s;s took her hand; and told her, that I could not, without the utmo&s;t concern, forbear to expre&s;s my apprehen&s;ions (from the di&s;tance &s;he was &s;o de&s;irous to keep me at), that if any man in the world was more <HI>indifferent</HI> to her, to u&s;e no har&s;her a word, than another, it was the unhappy wretch before her.</P>
<P>She looked &s;teadily upon me for a moment, and with her other hand, not withdrawing that I held, pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket; and by a twinkling motion, tried to di&s;&s;ipate a tear or two, which &s;tood ready in each eye, to meander them&s;elves a pa&s;&s;age down her glowing cheeks; but an&s;wered me only with a &s;igh, and an averted face.</P>
<P>I urged her to &s;peak; to look up at me; to ble&s;s me with an eye more favourable.</P>
<P>I had rea&s;on, &s;he told me, for my complaint of her indifference. She &s;aw nothing in my mind that was generous. I was not a man to be obliged or favour|ed. My &s;trange behaviour to her &s;ince Saturday night, for no cau&s;e at all that &s;he knew of, con|vinced her of this. Whatever hopes &s;he had con|ceived of me, were utterly di&s;&s;ipated: All my ways were di&s;gu&s;tful to her.</P>
<P>This cut me to the heart. The guilty, I believe, in every ca&s;e, le&s;s patiently bear the detecting truth, than the innocent do the degrading fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>I be&s;poke her patience, while I took the liberty to account for this change, on my part.&mdash;I re-acknow|leged the pride of my heart, which could not bear the thought of that want of preference in the heart of a lady, whom I hoped to call mine, which &s;he had al|ways manife&s;ted. Marriage, I &s;aid, was a &s;tate that
<PB N="155" REF="162">
was not to be entered upon with indifference on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>It is in&s;olence, interrupted &s;he, it is pre&s;umption, Sir, to expect tokens of value, without re&s;olving to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> them. You have no whining creature before you, Mr. Lovelace, overcome by weak motives, to love where there is no merit. Mi&s;s Howe can tell you, Sir, that I never loved the <HI>faults</HI> of my friend; nor ever wi&s;hed her to love me for mine. It was a rule with us, not to &s;pare each other. And would a man who has nothing but faults (for pray, Sir, what are your virtues?) expect that I &s;hould &s;hew a value for him? Indeed, if I did, I &s;hould not de&s;erve even <HI>his</HI> value, but ought to be de&s;pi&s;ed by him.</P>
<P>Well have you, Madam, kept up to this noble manner of thinking. You are in no danger of being de&s;pi&s;ed for any marks of tenderne&s;s or favour &s;hewn to the man before you. You have been perhaps, <HI>you'll</HI> think, <HI>laudably</HI> &s;tudious of making and taking occa&s;ions to declare, that it was far from being owing to your choice, that you had any thoughts of me. My whole &s;oul, Madam, in all its errors, in all its wi&s;hes, in all its views, had been laid open and naked before you, had I been en|couraged by &s;uch a &s;hare in your confidence and e&s;teem, as would have &s;ecured me again&s;t your appre|hended wor&s;t con&s;tructions of what I &s;hould from time to time have revealed to you, and con&s;ulted you upon. For never was there a franker heart; nor a man &s;o ready to accu&s;e him&s;elf. [This, Belford, is true]. But you know, Madam, how much other|wi&s;e it has been between us.&mdash;Doubt, di&s;tance, re|&s;erve, on your part, begat doubt, fear, awe, on mine.&mdash;How little confidence! as if we apprehended each other to be a plotter rather than a lover. How have I dreaded every letter that has been brought you from Wil&s;on's!&mdash;And with rea&s;on; &s;ince the la&s;t,

<P>I was guilty, it &s;eems, of going to church, &s;aid the indignant charmer; and without the company of a man, who&s;e choice it would not have been to go, had I not gone. I was guilty of de&s;iring to have the whole Sunday to my&s;elf, after I had obliged you, again&s;t my will, at a play; and after you had detained me, equally to my di&s;like, to a very late hour over night.&mdash;The&s;e were my faults: For the&s;e I was to be puni&s;hed; I was to be compelled to &s;ee you, and to be terrified when I did &s;ee you, by the mo&s;t &s;hocking ill-humour that was ever &s;hewn to a creature in my circum&s;tances, and not bound to bear it. You have pretended to find free fault with my father's temper, Mr. Lovelace: But the wor&s;t that he ever &s;hewed <HI>after</HI> marriage, was not in the lea&s;t to be compared to what you have &s;hewn twenty times <HI>beforehand.</HI>&mdash;And what are my pro&s;pects with you, at the very be&s;t?&mdash;My indignation ri&s;es again&s;t you, Mr. Love|lace, while I &s;peak to you, when I recollect the many in&s;tances, equally ungenerous and unpolite, of your behaviour to one whom you have brought into di|&s;tre&s;s&mdash;And I can hardly bear you in my &s;ight.</P>
<P>She turned from me, &s;tanding up; and lifting up her folded hands and charming eyes, &s;wimming in tears&mdash;O my dear papa, &s;aid the inimitable creature, you might have &s;pared your heavy cur&s;e, had you known how I have been puni&s;hed, ever &s;ince my &s;werving feet led me out of your garden-doors to meet this man!

<P>She pau&s;ed. I was &s;ilent. By my &s;oul, thought I, this &s;weet creature will at la&s;t undo me!</P>

<P>But I had better not to have had a copy of it, as far as I know: For, determined as I was before upon my operations, it in&s;tantly turned all my re&s;olutions in her favour. Yet I would give &s;omething to be convinced, that &s;he did not pop it into her drawer before the wench, in order for me to &s;ee it; and perhaps (if I were to take notice of it) to di&s;cover whether Dorcas, according to Mi&s;s Howe's advice, were mo&s;t <HI>my</HI> friend, or <HI>hers.</HI></P>
<P>The very &s;u&s;picion of this will do her no good: For I cannot bear to be artfully treated. People love to enjoy their own peculiar talents in <HI>monopoly,</HI> as I may &s;ay.

Prythee, dear Belford, once more leave us to our fate; and do not thou interpo&s;e with thy non&s;en&s;e, to weaken a &s;pirit already too &s;queami&s;h, and &s;trengthen a con&s;cience that has declared it&s;elf of her party.</P>
<P>Then again, remember thy recent di&s;coveries, Love|lace!&mdash;Remember her indifference, attended with all the appearance of contempt and hatred.

<P>My cur&s;ed character, as I have often &s;aid, was again&s;t me at &s;etting out!&mdash;Yet is &s;he not a <HI>woman?</HI> Cannot I find one but half-yielding moment, if &s;he do not ab&s;olutely hate me?</P>
<P>But with what can I tempt her?&mdash;RICHES &s;he was born to, and de&s;pi&s;es, knowing what they are. JEW|ELS and ornaments, to a mind &s;o much a jewel, and &s;o richly &s;et, her worthy con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s will not let her value. LOVE, if &s;he be &s;u&s;ceptible of Love, it &s;eems to be &s;o much under the direction of prudence, that one unguarded moment, I fear, cannot be rea&s;onably hoped for: And &s;o much VIGILANCE, &s;o much Apprehen|&s;ivene&s;s, that her fears are ever aforehand with her dan|gers. Then her LOVE OF VIRTUE &s;eems to be <HI>prin|ciple,</HI> native, or, if <HI>not</HI> native, &s;o deeply rooted, that

its fibres have &s;truck into her heart, and, as &s;he grew up, &s;o blended and twi&s;ted them&s;elves with the &s;trings of life, that I doubt there is no &s;eparating of the one, without cutting the others a&s;under.</P>
<P>What then can be done to make &s;uch a matchle&s;s creature as this get over the fir&s;t te&s;ts, in order to put her to the grand proof, whether once overcome, &s;he will not be always overcome?</P>
<P>By my faith, Jack, as I &s;it gazing upon her, my whole &s;oul in my eyes, contemplating her perfections, and thinking, when I have &s;een her ea&s;y and &s;erene, what would be her thoughts, did <HI>&s;he</HI> know my heart as well as <HI>I</HI> know it; when I behold her di&s;turbed and jealous, how <HI>ju&s;t</HI> her apprehen&s;ions, and that &s;he can|not fear &s;o much as there is <HI>room</HI> for her to fear; my heart often mi&s;gives me.</P>
<P>And mu&s;t, think I, O creature &s;o divinely excellent, and &s;o beloved of my &s;oul, tho&s;e arms, tho&s;e incir|cling arms, that would make a monarch happy, be u&s;ed to repel brutal force; all their &s;trength, unavail|ingly perhaps, exerted to repel it, and to defend a per&s;on &s;o delicately framed? Can violence enter into the heart of a wretch, who might intitle him&s;elf to all thy willing, yet virtuous love, and make the ble&s;&s;|ings thou a&s;pire&s;t after, her <HI>duty</HI> to confer?&mdash;Begone, villain-purpo&s;es!&mdash;Sink ye all to the hell that could only in&s;pire ye!&mdash;And I am ready to throw my&s;elf at her feet, confe&s;s my villainous de&s;igns, avow my re|pentance, and put it out of my power to act un|worthily by &s;uch a peerle&s;s excellence.</P>
<P>How then comes it, that all the&s;e compa&s;&s;ionate, and, as &s;ome would call them, <HI>hone&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;ibilities go off?&mdash;Why, Mi&s;s Howe will tell thee: She &s;ays, I am the <HI>devil.</HI>&mdash;By my con&s;cience, I think he has, at pre&s;ent, a great &s;hare in me.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Tue&s;day, May</HI> 23.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WELL did I, and but ju&s;t in time, conclude to have done with Mrs. Fretchville and the hou&s;e: For here Mennell has declar'd, that he cannot in con|&s;cience and honour go any farther.&mdash;He would not for the world be acce&s;&s;ory to the deceiving of &s;uch a Lady!&mdash;I was a fool to let either you or him &s;ee her; for ever <HI>&s;ince</HI> ye have both had &s;cruples, which neither would have had, were a <HI>woman</HI> to have been in the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Well, I can't help it!</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="180">He has, however, tho' with &s;ome reluctance, con|&s;ented to write me a letter, provided I will allow it to he the la&s;t &s;tep he &s;hall take in this affair.</P>
<P>I pre&s;umed, I told him, that if I could make Mrs. Fretchville's <HI>woman</HI> &s;upply his place, he would have no objection to that.</P>
<P><HI>None,</HI> he &s;ays,&mdash;<HI>But is it not pity</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>A pitiful fellow! Such a ridiculous kind of pity <HI>his,</HI> as tho&s;e &s;illy &s;ouls have, who would not kill an innocent chicken for the world; but when killed to their hands, are always the mo&s;t greedy devourers of it.</P>
<P>Now this letter gives the &s;ervant the &s;mall-pox: And &s;he has given it to her unhappy vapouri&s;h lady. Vapouri&s;h people are perpetual &s;ubjects for di&s;ea&s;es to work upon. <HI>Name</HI> but the malady, and it is <HI>theirs</HI> in a moment. <HI>Ever</HI> fitted for inoculation.&mdash;The phy&s;ical tribe's milch-cows.&mdash;A vapouri&s;h or &s;ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">netic patient is a fiddle for the doctors; and they are eternally playing upon it. Sweet mu&s;ic does it make them. All their difficulty, except a ca&s;e extraordinary happens (as poor Mrs. Fretchville's, who has <HI>rea|lized</HI> her apprehen&s;ions), is but to hold their counte|nance, while their patient is drawing up a bill of in|dictment again&s;t him&s;elf;&mdash;and when they have heard it, proceed to <HI>puni&s;h:</HI>&mdash;The right word for <HI>pre&s;cribe.</HI> Why &s;hould they not, when the criminal has con|fe&s;&s;ed his guilt?&mdash;And <HI>puni&s;h</HI> they generally do with a vengeance.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;illy toads too, now I think of it! For why, when they know they cannot do good, may they not as well endeavour to gratify, as to nau&s;eate, the pa|tient's palate?</P>
<P>Were I a phy&s;ician, I'd get all the trade to my&s;elf: For Malm&s;ey, and Cyprus, and the generous pro|ducts of the Cape, a little di&s;gui&s;ed, &s;hould be my principal do&s;es: As the&s;e would create new &s;pirits,
<PB N="174" REF="181">
how would the revived patient covet the phy&s;ic, and adore the doctor!</P>
<P>Give all the paraders of the faculty whom thou knowe&s;t, this hint.&mdash;There could but one inconve|nience ari&s;e from it. The APOTHECARIES would find their medicines co&s;t them <HI>&s;omething:</HI> But the demand for quantities would an&s;wer that: Since the hone&s;t NURSE would be the patient's ta&s;ter; perpetually re|quiring repetitions of the la&s;t cordial julap.</P>
<P>Well, but to the letter&mdash;Yet what need of further explanation after the hints in my former? The widow cannot be removed; and that's enough: And Men|nell's work is over; and his con&s;cience left to plague him for his own &s;ins, and not another man's: And, very po&s;&s;ibly, plague enough will it give him for tho&s;e.</P>
<P>This letter is directed, <HI>To Robert Lovelace, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> or, in his ab&s;ence, To his Lady.</HI> She had refu&s;ed dining with me, or &s;eeing me; and I was out when it came. She open'd it: So is my lady by her own con&s;ent, proud and &s;aucy as &s;he is.</P>
<P>I am glad at my heart that it came before we intirely make up. She would el&s;e, perhaps, have concluded it to be contrived for a delay: And now, moreover, we can accommodate our old and new quarrels together; and that's contrivance, you know. But how is her dear haughty heart humbled to what it was when I knew her fir&s;t, that &s;he can apprehend <HI>any</HI> delays from me; and have nothing to do but to vex at them!</P>
<P>I came in to dinner. She &s;ent me down the letter, de&s;iring my excu&s;e for opening it. Did it before &s;he was aware. Lady-Pride, Belford!&mdash;Recollection, then Retrogradation!</P>
<P>I reque&s;ted to &s;ee her upon it that moment. But &s;he de&s;ires to &s;u&s;pend our interview till morning. I will bring her to own, before I have done with her, that &s;he can't &s;ee me too often.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="182">My impatience was &s;o great, on an occa&s;ion &s;o <HI>un|expected,</HI> that I could not help writing, to tell her,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'how much vex'd I was at the accident: But that it need not delay my happy day, as That did not depend upon the hou&s;e [She knew That before, &s;he'll think, and &s;o did I]: And as Mrs. Fretchville, by Mr. Mennell, &s;o hand&s;omely expre&s;&s;ed her con|cern upon it, and her wi&s;hes, that it could &s;uit us to bear with the unavoidable delay, I hoped, that going down to The Lawn for two or three of the &s;um|mer-months, when I was made the happie&s;t of men, would be favourable to all round.'</Q></P>
<P>The dear creature takes this incident to heart, I be|lieve: And &s;ends word to my repeated reque&s;t to &s;ee her, notwith&s;tanding her denial, that &s;he cannot till the morning: It &s;hall be then at &s;ix o'clock, if I plea&s;e!</P>
<P>To be &s;ure I <HI>do</HI> plea&s;e!</P>
<P>Can &s;ee her but once a day now, Jack!</P>
<P>Did I tell thee, that I wrote a letter to my cou&s;in Montague, wondering that I heard not from Lord M. as the &s;ubject was &s;o very intere&s;ting? In it I acquainted her with the hou&s;e I was about taking; and with Mrs. Fretchville's vapouri&s;h delays.</P>
<P>I was very loth to engage my own family, either man or woman, in this affair; but I mu&s;t take my mea&s;ures &s;ecurely: And already they all think as bad of me as they well can. You ob&s;erve by my Lord M.'s to your&s;elf, that the well-manner'd Peer is afraid I &s;hould play this admirable creature one of my <HI>u&s;ual dog's tricks.</HI></P>
<P>I have received ju&s;t now an an&s;wer from Charlotte.</P>
<P>Charlotte i'n't well. A &s;tomach-di&s;order.</P>
<P>No wonder a girl's &s;tomach &s;hould plague her. A &s;ingle lady; that's it. When &s;he has a man to plague, it will have &s;omething be&s;ides it&s;elf to prey upon. Knowe&s;t thou not moreover, that man is the woman's
<PB N="176" REF="183">
Sun; woman is the man's Earth?&mdash;How dreary, how de&s;olate, the Earth, that is deprived of the all-&s;alubri|ating Sun-&s;hine!</P>
<P>Poor Charlotte! But I <HI>heard</HI> &s;he was not well: That encouraged me to write to her; and to expre&s;s my&s;elf a little concerned, that &s;he had not of her own accord thought of a vi&s;it in town to my charmer.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have been in daily hope for a long time, I mu&s;t call it, of hearing that the happy knot was ty'd. My Lord has been very much out of or|der: And yet nothing would &s;erve him, but he would him&s;elf write an an&s;wer to your letter. It was the only opportunity he &s;hould ever have, per|haps, to throw in a little good advice to you, with the hope of its being of any &s;ignification; and he has been &s;everal hours in a day, as his gout would let him, bu&s;ied in it: It wants now only his la&s;t revi&s;al. He hopes it will have the greater weight with you, if it appear all in his own hand-writing.</P>
<P>Indeed, Mr. Lovelace, his worthy heart is wrapt up in you. I wi&s;h you loved your&s;elf but half as well. But I believe too, that if all the family loved you le&s;s, you would love your&s;elf more.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip has been very bu&s;y, at the times he could not write, in con&s;ulting Pritchard about tho&s;e e&s;tates, which he propo&s;es to transfer to you on the happy occa&s;ion, that he may an&s;wer your letter in the mo&s;t acceptable manner; and &s;hew, by effects, how kindly he takes your invitation. I a&s;&s;ure you, he is mighty proud of it.</P>
<P>As for my&s;elf, I am not at all well, and have not been for &s;ome weeks pa&s;t, with my old &s;tomach-di&s;order. I had certainly el&s;e before now have done
<PB N="177" REF="184">
my&s;elf the honour you wonder I have <HI>not</HI> done my|&s;elf. My aunt Lawrance, who would have accom|panied me (for we had laid it all out), has been ex|ceedingly bu&s;y in her law-affair; her antagoni&s;t, who is actually on the &s;pot, having been making propo&s;als for an accommodation. But you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that when our dear relation-elect &s;hall be enter'd up|on the new habitation you tell me of, we will do our|&s;elves the honour of vi&s;iting her; and if any delay ari&s;es from the dear lady's want of courage, which, con&s;idering her man, let me tell you, may very well be, we will endeavour to in&s;pire her with it, and be &s;pon&s;ors for you;&mdash;for, cou&s;in, I believe you have need to be chri&s;ten'd over again before you are in|titled to &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing. What think you?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t now, my Lord tells me, he will di&s;patch a man on purpo&s;e with his letter to-morrow: So I need not have written. But now I have, let it go; and by Emp&s;on, who &s;ets out directly on his return to town.</P>
<P>My be&s;t compliments, and &s;i&s;ter's, to the mo&s;t de|&s;erving Lady in the world (You will need no other direction to the per&s;on meant), conclude me</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THOU &s;ee&s;t how &s;ea&s;onably this letter comes. I hope my Lord will write nothing but what I may &s;hew my beloved. I have actually &s;ent her up this letter of Charlotte's; and hope for happy effects from it.</P>
<P>THE Lady, in her next letter, gives Mi&s;s Howe an account of what has pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Lovelace and her&s;elf. She re&s;ents his behaviour with her u&s;ual dignity: But when &s;he comes to mention Mr. Men+nell's letter, &s;he re-urges Mi&s;s Howe to perfect her &s;cheme for her deliverance; being re&s;olved to leave
<PB N="178" REF="185">
him. But, dating again, on his &s;ending up to her Mi&s;s Montague's letter, &s;he alters her mind, and de|&s;ires her to &s;u&s;pend, for the pre&s;ent, her application to Mrs. Town&s;end.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I had begun, &s;ays &s;he, to &s;u&s;pect all he had &s;aid of Mrs. Fretchville and her hou&s;e; and even Mr. Mennell him&s;elf, though &s;o well appearing a man.

But may he not thank him&s;elf for acting &s;o very unaccountably, and taking &s;uch needle&s;ly-wry &s;teps, as he has done; embara&s;&s;ing, as I told him, his own meanings, if they were good?'</Q></P>

<P>I &s;aid, She might keep the letter it&s;elf, and &s;end it to Mi&s;s Howe, if &s;he plea&s;ed; for that, I &s;uppo&s;ed, was her intention. She bow'd her head to me. There, Jack!&mdash;I &s;hall have her courte&s;y to me, by-and-by, I que&s;tion not. What a-devil had I to do, to terrify the &s;weet creature by my termagant projects!&mdash;Yet it was not ami&s;s, I believe, to make her afraid of me. She <HI>&s;ays,</HI> I am an unpolite man&mdash;And every polite in&s;tance from &s;uch a one, is deem'd a favour.</P>
<P>Talking of the &s;ettlements, I told her, that I had rather Pritchard (mentioned by my cou&s;in Charlotte), had not been con&s;ulted on this occa&s;ion. Pritchard, indeed, was a very hone&s;t man; and had been for a generation in the family; and knew the e&s;tates, and the condition of them, better than either my Lord or my&s;elf: But Pritchard, like other old men, was diffi|dent and &s;low; and valued him&s;elf upon his &s;kill as a draughts-man; and for the &s;ake of that paltry repu|tation,
<PB N="180" REF="187">
mu&s;t have all his forms pre&s;erved, were an imperial crown to depend upon his di&s;patch.</P>
<P>I ki&s;&s;ed her unrepul&s;ing hand no le&s;s than five times during this conver&s;ation. Lord, Jack, how my ge|nerous heart run over!&mdash;She was quite obliging at parting.&mdash;She in a manner a&s;ked me <HI>leave</HI> to retire; to reperu&s;e Charlotte's letter.&mdash;I think &s;he bent her knees to me; but I won't be &s;ure.&mdash;How happy might we have both been long ago, had the dear crea|ture been always as complai&s;ant to me! For I do love re&s;pect, and, whether I de&s;erved it or not, al|ways had it, till I knew this proud beauty.</P>
<P>And now, Belford, are we in a train, or the duce is in it. Every fortified town has its &s;trong and its weak place. I had carried on my attacks again&s;t the impregnable parts. I have no doubt but I &s;hall either <HI>&s;hine</HI> or <HI>&s;muggle</HI> her out of her cloak, &s;ince &s;he and Mi&s;s Howe have intended to employ a &s;muggler again&s;t <HI>me.</HI>&mdash;All we wait for now, is my Lord's letter.</P>
<P>But I had like to have <HI>forgot</HI> to tell thee, that we have been not a little alarm'd, by &s;ome inquiries that have been made after me and my beloved, by a man of good appearance; who ye&s;terday procured a trade&s;man in the neighbouroood to &s;end for Dorcas: Of whom he a&s;ked &s;everal que&s;tions relating to us; and particularly (as we boarded and lodged in one hou&s;e), whether we were married?</P>
<P>This has given my beloved great unea&s;ine&s;s. And I could not help ob&s;erving upon it, to her, how right a thing it was, that we had given out below that we were married. The inquiry, mo&s;t probably, I &s;aid, was from her brother's quarter; and now, perhaps, that our marriage was owned, we &s;hould hear no more of his machinations. The per&s;on, it &s;eems, was curious to know the day that the ceremony was performed. But Dorcas refu&s;ed to give him any other particulars, than that we <HI>were</HI> married; and was the more re&s;erved, as he declined to tell her the motives of his inquiry.</P>

<P>THE devil take this uncle of mine! He has at la&s;t &s;ent me a letter, which I cannot &s;hew, without expo&s;ing the head of our family for a fool. A con|founded parcel of pop-guns has he let off upon me. I was in hopes he had exhau&s;ted his whole &s;tock of this &s;ort, in his letter to you.&mdash;To keep it back, to delay &s;ending it, till he had recollected all this <HI>farrago</HI> of non&s;en&s;e&mdash;Confound his <HI>Wi&s;dom of nations,</HI> if &s;o much of it is to be &s;craped together, in di&s;grace of it|&s;elf, to make one egregious &s;impleton!&mdash;But I am glad I am fortified with this piece of flagrant folly, however; &s;ince, in all human affairs, the <HI>convenient</HI> and <HI>inconvenient,</HI> the <HI>good</HI> and the <HI>bad,</HI> are &s;o mingled, that there is no having the one without the other.</P>
<P>I have already offer'd the bill inclo&s;ed in it to my beloved; and read to her part of the letter. But &s;he refu&s;ed the bill: And I, being in ca&s;h, &s;hall return it. She &s;eemed very de&s;irous to peru&s;e the whole let|ter. And when I told her, that were it not for ex|po&s;ing the writer, I would oblige her, &s;he &s;aid, It would not be expo&s;ing his Lord&s;hip to &s;hew it to her; and that &s;he always preferred the heart to the head. I knew her meaning&mdash;But did not thank her for it.</P>
<P>All that makes for me in it, I will tran&s;cribe for her&mdash;Yet, hang it, &s;he &s;hall have the letter, and my &s;oul with it, for one con&s;enting ki&s;s.</P>
<P>SHE has got the letter from me, without the re|ward. Duce take me, if I had the courage to pro|po&s;e the condition! A new character this of ba&s;hful|ne&s;s in thy friend.&mdash;I &s;ee, that a truly mode&s;t woman

<P>I DID intend to take my reward on her returning a letter &s;o favourable to us both. But &s;he &s;ent it to me, &s;ealed up by Dorcas.&mdash;I might have thought that there were two or three hints in it, that &s;he would be too nice immediately to appear to.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Tue&s;day, May</HI> 23.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>IT is a long lane that has no turning.</HI>&mdash;Do not de&s;pi&s;e me for my proverbs&mdash;You know I was always fond of them; and, if you had been &s;o too, it would have been the better for you, let me tell you. I dare &s;wear, the fine lady you are &s;o likely to be &s;oon happy with, will be far from de&s;pi&s;ing them; for I am told, that &s;he writes well, and that all her letters are full of &s;en|tences. God convert you! for nobody but He and this lady, can.</P>
<P>I have no manner of doubt now but that you will marry, as your father, and all your ance&s;tors, did be|fore you: El&s;e you would have had no title to be my heir; nor can your de&s;cendents have any title to be yours, unle&s;s they are legitimate; that's worth your remembrance, Sir!&mdash;<HI>No man is always a fool, every man &s;ometimes.</HI>&mdash;But your follies, I hope, are now at an end.</P>
<P>I know, you have vowed revenge again&s;t this fine lady's family: But no more of that, now. You mu&s;t
<PB N="183" REF="190">
look upon them all as your relations; and forgive, and forget. And when they &s;ee you make a good hu&s;band, and a good father (which God &s;end, for all our &s;akes!), they will wonder at their non&s;en&s;ical antipathy, and beg your pardon: But while they think you a vile fellow, and a rake, how can they either love you, or excu&s;e their daughter?</P>
<P>And methinks I could wi&s;h to give a word of comfort to the lady, who, doubtle&s;s, mu&s;t be under great fears, how &s;he &s;hall be able to hold-in &s;uch a wild creature, as you have hitherto been. I would hint to her, that, by &s;trong arguments, and gentle words, &s;he may do any thing with you; for tho' you are too apt to be hot, gentle words will cool you, and bring you into the temper that is nece&s;&s;ary for your cure.</P>
<P>Would to God, <HI>my</HI> poor lady, your aunt, who is dead and gone, had been a proper patient for the &s;ame remedy! God re&s;t her &s;oul! No reflections upon her memory! <HI>Worth is be&s;t known by want!</HI> I know <HI>hers</HI> now; and if I had went fir&s;t, &s;he would by this time have known <HI>mine.</HI></P>
<P>There is great wi&s;dom in that &s;aying, <HI>God &s;end me a friend, that may tell me of my faults: If not, an enemy; and he will.</HI> Not that I am your enemy; and that you know well. <HI>The more noble any one is, the more humble:</HI> So bear with me, if you would be thought noble.&mdash;Am I not your uncle? And do I not de&s;ign to be better to you, than your father could be? Nay, I will be your father too, when the happy day comes; &s;ince you de&s;ire it: And pray make my compliments to my dear niece; and tell her, I wonder much that &s;he has &s;o long deferred your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Pray let her know, I will pre&s;ent HER (not <HI>you</HI>) either my Lanca&s;hire &s;eat, or <HI>The Lawn</HI> in Hert|ford&s;hire; and &s;ettle upon her a thou&s;and pounds a year, peny-rents; to &s;hew her, that we are not a family to take ba&s;e advantages: And you may have
<PB N="184" REF="191">
writings drawn, and &s;ettle as you will.&mdash;Hone&s;t Pritchard has the rent-roll of both the&s;e e&s;tates at his fingers end; and has been a good old &s;ervant. I re|commend him to your Lady's favour. I have already con&s;ulted him: He will tell you what is be&s;t for you, and mo&s;t plea&s;ing to me.</P>
<P>I am &s;till very bad with my gout; but will come in a litter, as &s;oon as the day is fixed: It would be the joy of my heart, to join your hands. And let me tell you, if you do not make the be&s;t of hu&s;bands to &s;o good a young lady, and one who has had &s;o much courage for your &s;ake, I will renounce you; and &s;ettle all I can upon her and hers by you, and leave you out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>If any thing be wanting for your further &s;ecurity, I am ready to give it (tho' you know, that my word has always been look'd upon as my bond): And when the Harlowes know all this, let us &s;ee whether they are able to blu&s;h, and take &s;hame upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Your two aunts want only to know the day, to make all the country round them blaze, and all their tenants mad. And, if any one of mine be &s;ober upon the occa&s;ion, Pritchard &s;hall eject him. And, on the birth of the fir&s;t child, if a &s;on, I will do &s;omething more for you, and repeat all our rejoicings.</P>
<P>I ought indeed to have written &s;ooner. But I knew, that if you thought me long, and were in ha&s;te as to your nuptials, you would write and tell me &s;o. But my gout was very trouble&s;ome: And I am but a &s;low writer, you know, at be&s;t: For Compo&s;ing is a thing, that tho' formerly I was very ready at it (as my Lord Lexington u&s;ed to &s;ay); yet having left it off a great while, I am not &s;o now. And I cho&s;e, on this occa&s;ion, to write all out of my own head and me|mory; and to give you my be&s;t advice; for I may never have &s;uch an opportunity again. You have had (God mend you!) a &s;trange way of turning your back upon all I have &s;aid; This once, I hope, you
<PB N="185" REF="192">
will be more attentive to the advice I give you for your own good.</P>
<P>I had &s;till another end; nay, two other ends.</P>
<P>The one was, That now you are upon the borders of wedlock, as I may &s;ay, and <HI>all your wild cats will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;own,</HI> I would give you &s;ome in&s;tructions as to your public as well as private behaviour in life; which, intending you &s;o much good as I'do, you ought to hear; and perhaps would never have li&s;ten'd to, on any le&s;s extraordinary occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is, That your dear lady-elect (who is, it &s;eems, her&s;elf &s;o fine and &s;o &s;ententious a writer) will &s;ee by this, that it is not our faults, nor for want of the be&s;t advice, that you was not a better man than you have hitherto been.</P>
<P>And now, in few words, for the conduct I would wi&s;h you to follow in public, as well as in private; if you would think me worthy of advi&s;ing. It &s;hall be &s;hort; &s;o be not unea&s;y.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>private</HI> life: Love your Lady as &s;he de|&s;erves. <HI>Let your actions prai&s;e you.</HI> Be a good hu&s;|band; and &s;o give the lye to all your enemies; and make them a&s;ham'd of their &s;candals: And let us have pride in &s;aying, that Mi&s;s Harlowe has not done either her&s;elf, or family, any di&s;credit by coming among us. Do this; and I, and your aunts, will love you for ever.</P>
<P>As to your <HI>public</HI> conduct:&mdash;This is what I could wi&s;h: But I reckon your Lady's wi&s;dom will put us both right&mdash;No di&s;paragement, Sir; &s;ince, with all your wit, you have not hitherto &s;hewn much wi&s;|dom, you know.</P>
<P>Get into parliament as &s;oon as you can: For you have talents to make a great figure there. Who &s;o proper to a&s;&s;i&s;t in making new holding laws, as tho&s;e whom no law in being could hold?</P>
<P>Then, for &s;o long as you will give attendance, in St. Stephen's chapel&mdash;(Its being called a chapel, I hope,
<PB N="186" REF="193">
will not <HI>di&s;gu&s;t</HI> you: I am &s;ure I have known many a riot there:&mdash;A Speaker has a hard time of it! But we <HI>Peers</HI> have more decorum.&mdash;But what was I going to &s;ay?&mdash;I mu&s;t go back.</P>
<P>For &s;o long as you will give your attendance in par|liament) for &s;o long will you be out of mi&s;chief; out of <HI>private</HI> mi&s;chief, at lea&s;t: And may St. Stephen's fate be yours, if you wilfully do <HI>public</HI> mi&s;chief!</P>
<P>When a new election comes, you will have two or three Boroughs, you know, to choo&s;e out of:&mdash;But if you &s;tay till then, I had rather you were for the Shire.</P>
<P>You'll have intere&s;t enough, I am &s;ure; and being &s;o hand&s;ome a man, the women will make their hu&s;|bands vote for you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall long to read your &s;peeches. I expect you will &s;peak, if occa&s;ion offers, the very fir&s;t day. You want no courage; and think highly enough of your|&s;elf, and lowly enough of every-body el&s;e, to &s;peak on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>As to the methods of the hou&s;e, you have &s;pirit enough, I fear, to be too much above them: Take care of that.&mdash;I don't &s;o much fear your want of good-manners. To <HI>men,</HI> you want no decency, if they don't provoke you: As to that, I wi&s;h you'd only learn to be as patient of contradiction from others, as you would have other people be to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' I would not have you to be a Courtier; nei|ther would I have you be a Malecontent. I remember (for I have it down) what my old friend Archibald Hutche&s;on &s;aid, and it was a very good &s;aying&mdash;(to Mr. Secretary Craggs, I think, it was)&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I look up|on an admini&s;tration, as intitled to every vote I can with good con&s;cience give it; for a Hou&s;e of Com|mons &s;hould not needle&s;ly put drags upon the wheels of Government: And, when I have not given it my vote, it was with regret: And, for my Country's &s;ake, I wi&s;h'd with all my heart, the mea&s;ure had been &s;uch as I could have approved.'</Q></P>

<P>Are the&s;e Sayings bad, Sir? Are they to be de|&s;pi&s;ed?&mdash;Well then, why &s;hould I be de&s;pi&s;ed for remembering them, and quoting them, as I love to do? Let me tell you, if you loved my company more than you do, you would not be the wor&s;e for it: I may &s;ay &s;o without any vanity; &s;ince it is other mens wi&s;dom, and not my own, that I am &s;o fond of.

<P>You may come in for the title when I am dead and gone&mdash;God help me!&mdash;So I would have you keep an equilibrium. If once you get the name of being a fine &s;peaker, you may have any thing: And, to be &s;ure, you have naturally a great deal of elocution; a tongue that would delude an angel, as the women &s;ay: To their &s;orrow, &s;ome of them, poor creatures!&mdash;A leading man in the Hou&s;e of Commons, is a very import|ant character; becau&s;e that hou&s;e has the giving of money: And <HI>Money makes the mare to go</HI>; ay, and Queens and Kings too, &s;ometimes, to go in a manner very different from what they might otherwi&s;e choo&s;e to go, let me tell you.</P>

<P>THOU &s;ee&s;t, Belford, how we now drive before the wind.&mdash;The dear creature now comes almo&s;t at the fir&s;t word, whenever I de&s;ire the honour of her company. I told her la&s;t night, that, apprehending delay from Pritchard's &s;lowne&s;s, I was determined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eave it to my Lord to make his compliments in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn way; and had actually that afternoon put my writings into the hands of a very eminent lawyer, Coun&s;ellor Williams, with directions for him to draw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p &s;ettlements from my own e&s;tate, and conformable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o tho&s;e of my own mother; which I put into his hands at the &s;ame time.

Indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndeed, my deare&s;t life, &s;aid I, you have hitherto af|forded me but a very thorny court&s;hip.</P>

Nor rave thou at me; but, if thou art my friend, think of Mi&s;s Howe's letters, and of her &s;muggling &s;cheme. All owing to my fair captive's informations and incite|ments.&mdash;Am I not a <HI>villain,</HI> a <HI>fool,</HI> a <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> with them already?&mdash;Yet no harm done by me, nor &s;o much as attempted?</P>
<P>Every thing of this nature, the dear creature an|&s;wered (with a downca&s;t eye, and a blu&s;hing cheek), &s;he left to me.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed my Lord's chapel for the celebration, where we might have the pre&s;ence of Lady Betty, Lady Sarah, and my two cou&s;ins Montague.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed not to favour a public celebration; and waved this &s;ubject for the pre&s;ent. I did &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;he would not choo&s;e to be married in public, any more than me: So I pre&s;&s;ed not this matter further ju&s;t then.</P>
<P>But patterns I actually produced; and a jeweller was to bring as this day &s;everal &s;ets of jewels, for her choice. But the patterns &s;he would not open. She &s;ighed at the mention of them; The &s;econd patterns, &s;he &s;aid, that had been offered to her <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>I.</HI> p. <HI>279.</HI></NOTE>: And very peremptorily forbid the jeweller's coming; as well as declined my offer of getting my own mother's to be new-&s;et; at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure thee, Belford, I was in earne&s;t in all this. My whole e&s;tate is nothing to me, put in com|petition with her hoped-for favour.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="198">She then told me, that &s;he had written her opinion of my general propo&s;als; and there had expre&s;&s;ed her mind, as to cloaths and jewels:&mdash;But on my beha|viour to her, for no cau&s;e that &s;he knew of, on Sun|day night, &s;he had torn the paper in two. I earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed her to let me be favoured with a &s;ight of this paper, torn as it was. And after &s;ome he&s;itation, &s;he withdrew, and &s;ent it to me by Dorcas.</P>
<P>I peru&s;ed it again. It was in a manner new to me, tho' I had read it &s;o lately; and by my &s;oul I could hardly &s;tand it. An hundred admirable creatures I called her to my&s;elf.&mdash;But I charge thee, write not a word to me in her favour, if thou meane&s;t her well; for if I &s;pare her, it mu&s;t be all <HI>ex mero motu.</HI></P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, when I was re-admitted to her pre&s;ence, that I ran over in her prai&s;es, and in vows of gratitude, and everla&s;ting love. But here's the devil; &s;he &s;till receives all I &s;ay with re&s;erve; or if it be not with re&s;erve, &s;he receives it &s;o much as her due, that &s;he is not at all rai&s;ed by it. Some women are undone by prai&s;e, by flattery. I my&s;elf am proud of prai&s;e.&mdash;Perhaps thou wilt &s;ay, that tho&s;e are mo&s;t proud of it, who lea&s;t de&s;erve it&mdash;As tho&s;e are of riches and grandeur, who are not born to either. I own, that it requires a &s;oul to be &s;uperior to the&s;e foibles. Have I not then a &s;oul?&mdash;Surely, I have.&mdash;Let me then be con&s;ider'd as an exception to the rule.</P>
<P>Now have I a foundation to go upon in my terms. My Lord, in the exuberance of his genero&s;ity, men|tions a thou&s;and pounds a year peny-rents. <HI>This</HI> I know, that were I to marry this Lady, he would ra|ther &s;ettle upon her all he has a mind to &s;ettle, than upon me: And has even threatened, that if I prove not a good hu&s;band to her, he will leave all he can at his death, from me, to her.&mdash;Yet con&s;iders not, that a woman &s;o perfect, can never be di&s;plea&s;ed with her hu&s;band but to <HI>his</HI> di&s;grace; for who will blame <HI>her?</HI>

Another rea&s;on, why a Lovelace &s;hould not wi&s;h to marry a CLARISSA.</P>
<P>But what a pretty fellow of an uncle mine, to think of making a wife independent of her emperor, and a rebel of cour&s;e&mdash;Yet &s;marted him&s;elf for an error of this kind!</P>
<P>My beloved, in her torn paper, mentions but two hundred pounds a year, for her &s;eparate u&s;e. I in|&s;i&s;ted upon her naming a larger &s;um. She &s;aid, it might then be three; and I, for fear &s;he &s;hould &s;u|&s;pect very large offers, named five, and the intire di&s;|po&s;al of all arrears in her father's hands, for the be|nefit of Mrs. Norton, or whom &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, that the good woman would be unea&s;y, if any thing more than a competency were done for her. She was for &s;uiting all her di&s;po&s;itions of this kind, &s;he &s;aid, to the u&s;ual way of life of the per&s;on. To go beyond it, was but to put the benefited upon projects, or to make them aukward in a new &s;tate, when they might &s;hine in that they were accu&s;tomed to. And to put it into &s;o good a mother's power to give her &s;on a beginning in his bu&s;ine&s;s, at a proper time; yet to leave her &s;omething for her&s;elf, to &s;et her above want, or the nece&s;&s;ity of taking back from her child what &s;he had been enabled to be&s;tow upon him, would be the height of &s;uch a worthy parent's ambition.</P>
<P>Here is prudence! Here is judgment in &s;o young a creature! How do I hate the Harlowes for producing &s;uch an angel!&mdash;O why, why, did &s;he refu&s;e my &s;in|cere addre&s;s to tie the knot before we came to this hou&s;e!</P>
<P>But yet, what mortifies my pride, is, that this ex|alted creature, if I were to marry her, would not be governed in her behaviour to me by love, but by ge|nero&s;ity merely, or by blind duty; and had rather live &s;ingle, than be mine.</P>
<P>I cannot bear this. I would have the woman whom I honour with my name, if ever I confer this honour

upon any, forego even her &s;uperior duties for me. I would have her look after me when I go out, as far as &s;he can &s;ee me, as my Ro&s;ebud after her Johnny; and meet me at my return with rapture. I would be the &s;ubject of her dreams, as well as of her waking thoughts. I would have her look upon every moment lo&s;t, that is not pa&s;&s;ed with me: Sing to me, read to me, play to me when I plea&s;ed; no joy &s;o great as in obeying me. When I &s;hould be inclined to love, overwhelm me with it; when to be &s;erious or &s;olitary, if intru&s;ive, awfully &s;o; retiring at a nod; approach|ing me only if I &s;miled encouragement: Steal into my pre&s;ence with &s;ilence; out of it, if not noticed, on tiptoe.

<P>The gentle Waller &s;ays, <HI>Women are born to be controul'd.</HI> Gentle as he was, he knew that. A ty|rant-hu&s;band makes a dutiful wife. And why do the Sex love rakes, but becau&s;e they know how to direct their uncertain wills, and manage them?</P>
<P>ANOTHER agreeable conver&s;ation. The day of days the &s;ubject. As to fixing a particular one, that need not be done till the &s;ettlements are completed. As to marrying at my Lord's chapel, the ladies of my family pre&s;ent, that would be making a public affair of it; and my charmer ob&s;erved with regret, that it &s;eemed to be my Lord's intention to make it &s;o.</P>
<P>It could not be imagined, I &s;aid, but that his Lord|&s;hip's &s;etting out in a litter, and coming to town, as well as his ta&s;te for glare, and the joy he would take to &s;ee me married at la&s;t, would give it as much the

air of a public marriage, as if the ceremony were per|formed at his own chapel, all the ladies pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>She could not bear the thoughts of a public day. It would carry with it an air of in&s;ult upon her whole family. And, for her part, if my Lord would not take it ami&s;s (and perhaps he would not, as the mo|tion came not from him&s;elf, but from me), &s;he would very willingly di&s;pen&s;e with his Lord&s;hip's pre&s;ence; the rather, as dre&s;s and appearance would then be un|nece&s;&s;ary.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>IF, Belford, thou like&s;t not my plot upon Mi&s;s Howe, I have three or four more as good in my own opinion; better, perhaps, they will be in thine: And &s;o 'tis but getting loo&s;e from thy pre&s;ent engage|ment, and thou &s;halt pick and choo&s;e. But as for thy three brethren, they mu&s;t do as I'd have them: And &s;o, indeed, mu&s;t thou:&mdash;El&s;e why am I your general?&mdash;But I will refer this &s;ubject to its proper &s;ea|&s;on. Thou knowe&s;t, that I never ab&s;olutely conclude upon a project, till 'tis time for execution: And then lightning &s;trikes not quicker than I.</P>
<P>And now to the &s;ubject next my heart.</P>
<P>Wilt thou believe me, when I tell thee, that I have &s;o many contrivances ri&s;ing up and crouding upon me for preference, with regard to my Gloriana, that I hardly know which to choo&s;e?&mdash;I could tell thee of no le&s;s than &s;ix princely ones, any of which <HI>mu&s;t</HI> do. But as the dear creature has not grudged giving me trouble, I think I ought not, in gratitude, to &s;pare combu&s;tibles for her; but, on the contrary, to make her &s;tare and &s;tand agha&s;t, by &s;pringing three or four mines at once.</P>
<P>Thou remembre&s;t what Shake&s;peare, in his Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ida, makes Hector, who, however, is not u&s;ed to boa&s;t, &s;ay to Achilles, in an interview between them; and which, applied to this watchful Lady, and to the vexation &s;he has given me, and to the certainty I now think I have of &s;ubduing her; will run thus:&mdash;Suppo&s;ing the charmer before me; and I meditating her &s;weet per&s;on from head to foot:
<Q><L>Henceforth, <HI>O watchful fair one,</HI> guard thee well:</L>
<L>For I'll not kill thee There! nor There! nor There!</L>
<L>But, by the <HI>zone that circles Venus' wai&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="198" REF="205">I'll kill thee Ev'ry-where; yea, o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>Thou, wi&s;e&s;t <HI>Belford,</HI> pardon me this brag:</L>
<L><HI>Her watchfulne&s;s</HI> draws folly from my lips;</L>
<L>But I'll endeavour <HI>deeds</HI> to match the <HI>words,</HI></L>
<L>Or may I never&mdash;</L></Q>
Then, I imagine thee interpo&s;ing to qualify my impa|tience, as Ajax did to Achilles:
<Q><L>&mdash;Do not chafe thee, cou&s;in:</L>
<L>&mdash;And let the&s;e threats alone,</L>
<L>Till <HI>accident</HI> or <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> bring thee to it.</L></Q></P>
<P>And now, Jack, what do&s;t think?</P>
<P>That thou art a cur&s;ed fellow, if&mdash;</P>
<P>If! No If's&mdash;But I &s;hall be very &s;ick to-morrow. I &s;hall, 'faith.</P>
<P>Sick!&mdash;Why &s;ick?&mdash;What a devil &s;hould&s;t thou be &s;ick for?</P>
<P>For more good rea&s;ons than one, Belford.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to hear but one.&mdash;Sick, quotha! Of all thy rogui&s;h inventions, I &s;hould not have thought of this.</P>
<P>Perhaps thou thinke&s;t my view to be, to draw the lady to my bed&s;ide: That's a trick of three or four thou&s;and years old; and I &s;hould find it much more to my purpo&s;e, if I could get to her's. However, I'll conde&s;cend to make thee as wi&s;e as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am exce&s;&s;ively di&s;turb'd about this &s;muggling &s;cheme of Mi&s;s Howe. I have no doubt, that my fair one will fly from me, if &s;he can, were I to make an attempt, and mi&s;carry. I once believed &s;he loved me: But now I doubt whether &s;he does or not: At lea&s;t, that it is with &s;uch an <HI>ardor,</HI> as Mi&s;s Howe calls it, as will make her overlook a premeditated fault, &s;hould I be guilty of one.</P>
<P>And what will being &s;ick do for thee?</P>
<P>Have patience. I don't intend to be &s;o very bad as Dorcas &s;hall repre&s;ent me to be. But yet I know
<PB N="199" REF="206">
I &s;hall reach confoundedly, and bring up &s;ome clot|ted blood. To be &s;ure, I &s;hall break a ve&s;&s;el: There's no doubt of that; and a bottle of Eaton's &s;typtic &s;hall be &s;ent for; but no doctor. If &s;he has <HI>humanity,</HI> &s;he will be concerned. But if &s;he has <HI>love,</HI> let it have been pu&s;h'd ever &s;o far back, it will, on this occa|&s;ion, come forward, and &s;hew it&s;elf; not only in her eye, but in every line of her &s;weet face.</P>
<P>I will be very intrepid. I will not fear death, or any thing el&s;e. I will be &s;ure of being well in an hour or two, having formerly found great benefit by this bal&s;amic medicine, on occa&s;ion of an inward brui&s;e by a fall from my hor&s;e in hunting, of which, perhaps, this malady may be the remains. And this will &s;hew her, that tho' tho&s;e about me may make the mo&s;t of it, I don't; and &s;o can have no de&s;ign in it.</P>
<P>Well, methinks thou &s;aye&s;t, I begin to think to|lerably of this device.</P>
<P>I knew thou would&s;t, when I explained my&s;elf. Another time prepare to wonder; and bani&s;h doubt.</P>
<P>Now, Belford, if &s;he be not much concerned at the broken ve&s;&s;el, which, in one &s;o fiery in his temper as I have the reputation to be thought, may be very dangerous; a malady that I &s;hall calmly attribute to the hara&s;&s;es and doubts, that I have laboured under for &s;ome time pa&s;t; which will be a further proof of my love, and will demand a grateful return&mdash;</P>
<P>What then, thou egregious contriver?</P>
<P>Why then I &s;hall have the le&s;s remor&s;e, if I am to u&s;e a little violence: For can &s;he de&s;erve compa&s;&s;ion, who &s;hews none?</P>
<P>And what if &s;he &s;hew a great deal of concern?</P>
<P>Then &s;hall I be in hope of building on a good foun|dation. Love hides a multitude of faults, and dimi|ni&s;hes tho&s;e it cannot hide. Love, when found out, or acknowleged, authorizes freedom; and freedom
<PB N="200" REF="207">
begets freedom; and I &s;hall then &s;ee how far I can go.</P>
<P>Well but, Lovelace, how the duce wilt thou, with that full health and vigour of con&s;titution, and with that bloom in thy face, make any-body believe thou art &s;ick?</P>
<P>How!&mdash;Why take a few grains of Ipecacuanha; enough to make me reach like a fury.</P>
<P>Good!&mdash;But how wilt thou manage to bring up blood, and not hurt thy&s;elf?</P>
<P>Fooli&s;h fellow! Are there not pigeons and chick|ens in every poulterer's &s;hop?</P>
<P>Cry thy mercy.</P>
<P>But then I will be per&s;uaded by Mrs. Sinclair, that I have of late confined my&s;elf too much; and &s;o will have a chair called, and be carried to the Park; where I will try to walk half the length of the Mall, or &s;o; and in my return, amu&s;e my&s;elf at White's or the Cocoa.</P>
<P>And what will this do?</P>
<P>Que&s;tioning again?&mdash;I am afraid thou'rt an infidel, Belford.&mdash;Why then &s;hall I not know if my beloved offers to go out in my ab&s;ence?&mdash;And &s;hall I not &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whether &s;he receives me with tenderne&s;s at my return? But this is not all: I have a foreboding that &s;omething affecting will happen while I am out. But of this more in its place.</P>
<P>And now, Belford, wilt thou, or wilt thou not, allow, that it is a right thing to be &s;ick?&mdash;Lord, Jack, &s;o much delight do I take in my contrivances, that I &s;hall be half-&s;orry, when the occa&s;ion for them is over; for never, never &s;hall I again have &s;uch charming exerci&s;e for my invention.</P>
<P>Mean time the&s;e plaguy women are &s;o impertinent, &s;o full of reproaches, that I know not how to do any thing but cur&s;e them. And then, truly, they are for helping me out with &s;ome of their trite and vulgar artifices.&mdash;Sally particularly; who pretends to be a mighty contriver, has ju&s;t now, in an in&s;olent manner,
<PB N="201" REF="208">
told me, on my rejecting her proffer'd aids, that I had no mind to conquer; and that I was &s;o <HI>wicked</HI> as to intend to marry, tho' I would not own it to her.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e this little devil made her fir&s;t &s;acrifice at my altar, &s;he thinks &s;he may take any liberty with me: And what makes her outrageous at times, is, that I have, for a long time, <HI>&s;tudiou&s;ly,</HI> as &s;he &s;ays, &s;lighted her too readily offer'd favours: But is it not very impudent in her to think, that I will be any man's &s;ucce&s;&s;or?

<P>The more devil I, perhaps thou'lt &s;ay, to endea|vour to corrupt the uncorrupted.</P>
<P>But I &s;ay, <HI>Not</HI>; &s;ince, hence, I have but very few adulteries to an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>One affair, indeed, at Paris, with a married lady [I believe I never told thee of it] touched my con|&s;cience a little: Yet brought on by the &s;pirit of in|trigue, more than by &s;heer wickedne&s;s. I'll give it thee in brief:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A French marquis, &s;omewhat in years, employ'd by his court in a public function at that of Madrid, had put his charming, young, new-married wife un|der the controul and <HI>ward&s;hip,</HI> as I may &s;ay, of his in&s;olent &s;i&s;ter, an old prude.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I &s;aw the lady at the opera. I liked her at fir&s;t &s;ight, and better at &s;econd, when I knew the &s;itua|tion &s;he was in. So, pretending to make my ad|dre&s;&s;es to the prude, got admittance to both.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The fir&s;t thing I had to do, was, to compliment my prude into &s;hyne&s;s, by complaints of &s;hyne&s;s: Next to take advantage of the marqui&s;e's &s;ituation, between her hu&s;band's jealou&s;y, and his &s;i&s;ter's ar|rogance, to in&s;pire her with re&s;entment; and, as I

hoped, with a regard to my per&s;on. The Frenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ladies have no di&s;like to intrigue.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The &s;i&s;ter began to &s;u&s;pect me: The lady had no mind to part with the company of the only man who had been permitted to vi&s;it there; and told me of her &s;i&s;ter's &s;u&s;picions.&mdash;I put her upon concealing the prude, as if unknown to me, in a clo&s;et in one of her own apartments, locking her in, and putting the key in her own pocket; And &s;he was to que&s;tion me on the &s;incerity of my profe&s;&s;ions to her &s;i&s;ter, in her &s;i&s;ter's hearing.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'She comply'd. My mi&s;tre&s;s was locked up. The lady and I took our &s;eats. I owned fervent love, and made high profe&s;&s;ions: For the marqui&s;e put it home to me. The prude was delighted with what &s;he heard.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'And how do&s;t think it ended?&mdash;I took my ad|vantage of the lady her&s;elf, who dur&s;t not for her life cry out: Drew her after me to the next apart|ment, on pretence of going to &s;eek her &s;i&s;ter, who all the time was locked up in the clo&s;et.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'No woman ever gave me a private meeting for nothing; my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Harlowe excepted.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'My ingenuity obtained my pardon: The lady being unable to forbear laughing thro' the whole affair, to find both &s;o uncommonly tricked; her gaolere&s;s her pri&s;oner, &s;afe locked up, and as much plea&s;ed as either of us.</Q></P>

<P>The coach carried us to Ham&s;tead, to Highgate, to Muzzle-hill; back to Ham&s;tead to the Upper-Fla&s;k&punc; There, in compliment to the nymphs, my beloved con&s;ented to alight, and take a little refection. Then home early by Kenti&s;h Town.</P>

<P>But now this was to take down my countenance.

<P>EVERY one now is &s;ure, that &s;he loves me. Tears were in her eyes more than once for me. She &s;uf|fer'd me to take her hand, and ki&s;s it as often as I plea&s;ed.

<P>MR. Lovelace, my dear, has been very ill. Sud|denly taken. With a vomiting of blood in great quantities. Some ve&s;&s;el broken. He complained of a di&s;order in his &s;tomach over-night. I was the more affected with it, as I am afraid it was occa&s;ioned by the violent contentions between us.&mdash;But was I in fault?</P>
<P>How lately did I think I hated him!&mdash;But hatred and anger, I &s;ee, are but temporary pa&s;&s;ions with me.

<P>I Had a charming airing. No return of my ma|lady. My heart perfectly ea&s;y, how could my &s;tomach be otherwi&s;e?</P>
<P>But when I came home, I found that my &s;weet &s;oul had been alarmed by a new incident. The in|quiry after us both, in a very &s;u&s;picious manner, and that by de&s;cription of our per&s;ons, and not by names, by a &s;ervant in a blue livery turned up and trimmed with yellow.</P>
<P>Dorcas was called to him, as the upper &s;ervant, and &s;he refu&s;ing to an&s;wer any of his que&s;tions, unle&s;s he told his bu&s;ine&s;s, and from whom he came, the fel|low, as &s;hort as &s;he, &s;aid, That if &s;he would not an|&s;wer <HI>him,</HI> perhaps &s;he might an&s;wer &s;omebody <HI>el&s;e</HI>; and went away out of humour.</P>
<P>Dorcas hurried up to her lady, and alarmed her not only with the fact, but with her own conjectures; adding, that he was an ill-looking fellow, and &s;he was &s;ure could come for no good.</P>
<P>The livery and the features of the &s;ervant were particularly inquired after, and as particularly de|&s;cribed&mdash;<HI>Lord ble&s;s her! no end of her alarms, &s;he thought!</HI> And then was &s;he aforehand with every evil that could happen.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed Mr. Lovelace would come in.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace came in &s;oon after; all lively, grate|ful, full of hopes, of duty, of love, to thank his charmer, and to congratulate with her upon the cure &s;he had performed. And then &s;he told the &s;tory, with all its circum&s;tances; and Dorcas, to point her lady's fears, told us, that the &s;ervant was a &s;un-burnt fel|low, and looke as if he had been at &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="219">He was then, no doubt, Captain Singleton's &s;er|vant, and the next news &s;he &s;hould hear, was, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hou&s;e was &s;urrounded by a whole &s;hip's crew; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ve&s;&s;el lying no farther off, as &s;he under&s;tood, than Rotherhith.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible, I &s;aid. Such an attempt would not be u&s;her'd in by &s;uch a manner of inquiry. And why may it not rather be a &s;ervant of your cou&s;in Mor|den's, with notice of his arrival, and of his de&s;ign to attend you?</P>
<P>This &s;urmize delighted her. Her apprehen&s;ions went off, and &s;he was at lei&s;ure to congratulate me upon my &s;udden recovery; which &s;he did in the mo&s;t obliging manner.</P>
<P>But we had not &s;at long together, when Dorcas again came fluttering up to tell us, that the footman, the <HI>very</HI> footman, was again at the door, and inquired, whether Mr. Lovelace and his Lady, by name, had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lodgings in this hou&s;e?

And as the &s;ellow had not been an&s;wered by Dorcas, I propo&s;ed to go down to the &s;treet-parlour, and hear what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I &s;ee your cau&s;ele&s;s terror, my deare&s;t life, &s;aid I, and your impatience&mdash;Will you be plea&s;ed to walk down&mdash;And without being ob&s;erved, as he &s;hall come no farther than the parlour-door, you may hear all that pa&s;&s;es?</P>
<P>She con&s;ented. We went down. Dorcas bid the man come forward.&mdash;Well, friend, what is your bu|&s;ine&s;s with Mr. or Mrs. Lovelace?</P>
<P>Bowing, &s;craping, I am &s;ure you are the gentle|man, Sir. Why, Sir, my bu&s;ine&s;s is only to know if your honour be here, and to be &s;poke with; or it you &s;hall be here for any time?</P>
<P>Who came you from?</P>
<P>From a gentleman who ordered me to &s;ay, if I was
<PB N="213" REF="220">
<HI>made</HI> to tell, but not el&s;e, it was from a friend of Mr. John Harlowe's, Mrs. Lovelace's elde&s;t uncle.</P>
<P>The dear creature was ready to &s;ink upon this. It was but of late, that &s;he had provided her&s;elf with &s;alts. She pulled them out.</P>
<P>Do you know any thing of Colonel Morden, friend, &s;aid I?</P>
<P>No; I never heard of his name.</P>
<P>Of Captain Singleton?</P>
<P>No, Sir. But the gentleman, my ma&s;ter, is a cap|tain too.</P>
<P>What is his name?</P>
<P>I don't know if I &s;hould tell.</P>
<P>There can be no harm in telling the gentleman's name, if you come upon a good account.</P>
<P>That I do; for my ma&s;ter told me &s;o; and there is not an hone&s;ter gentleman on the face of <HI>God's earth.</HI>&mdash;His name is Captain Tomlin&s;on, Sir.</P>
<P>I don't know &s;uch a one.</P>
<P>I believe not, Sir. He was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, He don't know your honour, Sir; but I heard him &s;ay, as how he &s;hould not be an unwelcome vi&s;itor to you, for all that.</P>
<P>Do you know &s;uch a man as Captain Tomlin&s;on, my deare&s;t life, <HI>a&s;ide,</HI> your uncle's friend?</P>
<P>No; but my uncle may have acquaintance, no doubt, that I don't know.&mdash;But I hope, trembling, this is not a trick.</P>
<P>Well, friend, if your ma&s;ter has any thing to &s;ay to Mr. Lovelace, you may tell him, that Mr. Love|lace is here; and will give him a meeting whenever he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>The dear creature looked as if afraid that my en|gagement was too prompt for my own &s;afety; and away went the fellow.&mdash;<HI>I</HI> wondering, that <HI>&s;he</HI> might not wonder, that this Captain Tomlin&s;on, whoever he was, came not him&s;elf, or &s;ent not a letter the &s;e|cond time, when he had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that I might be here.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="221">Mean time, for fear that this &s;hould be a contrive|ance of James Harlowe's, who, I &s;aid, loved plot|ting, though he had not a head turned for it, I gave &s;ome precautionary directions to the &s;ervants, and the women, whom, for the greater parade, I a&s;&s;embled before us: And my beloved was re&s;olved not to &s;tir abroad till &s;he &s;aw the i&s;&s;ue of this odd affair.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 28</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS &s;tory of Captain Tomlin&s;on employed us not only for the time we were together la&s;t night, but all the while we &s;at at breakfa&s;t this morn|ing. She would &s;till have it, that it was the prelude to &s;ome mi&s;chief from Singleton. I in&s;i&s;ted, that it might much more probably be a method taken by Co|lonel Morden to alarm her, previous to a per&s;onal vi&s;it. Travelled gentlemen affected to &s;urprize in this manner. And why, deare&s;t creature, &s;aid I, mu&s;t every thing that happens, which we cannot im|mediately account for, be what we lea&s;t wi&s;h?</P>
<P>She had had &s;o many di&s;agreeable things befal her of late, that her fears were too often &s;tronger than her hopes.</P>
<P>And this, Madam, makes me apprehen&s;ive, that you will get into &s;o low-&s;pirited a way, that you will
<PB N="215" REF="222">
not be able to enjoy the happine&s;s that &s;eems to await us.</P>
<P>Her duty and her gratitude, &s;he gravely &s;aid, to the Di&s;pen&s;er of all good, would &s;ecure her, &s;he hoped, again&s;t unthankfulne&s;s. And a thankful &s;pi|rit was the &s;ame as a joyful one.</P>
<P>So, Belford, for all her future joys &s;he depends in|tirely upon the Invi&s;ible Good. She is certainly right; &s;ince tho&s;e who fix lea&s;t upon Second Cau&s;es are the lea&s;t likely to be di&s;appointed&mdash;And is not this gravity for her gravity?</P>
<P>She had hardly done &s;peaking, when Dorcas came running up in a hurry&mdash;She &s;et even <HI>my</HI> heart into a palpitation&mdash;Thump, thump, thump, like a precipi|tated pendulum in a clock-ca&s;e&mdash;Flutter, flutter, flut|ter my charmer's, as by her &s;weet bo&s;om ri&s;ing to her chin I &s;aw.</P>
<P>This lower cla&s;s of people, my Beloved her&s;elf ob|&s;erved, were for ever aiming at the &s;tupid Wonderful, and for making even common incidents matter of &s;ur|prize.</P>
<P>Why the devil, &s;aid I to the wench, this alarming hurry?&mdash;And with your &s;pread fingers, and your O Madams, and O Sirs!&mdash;and be curs'd to you: Would there have been a &s;econd of time difference, had you come up &s;lowly?</P>
<P>Captain Tomlin&s;on, Sir!</P>
<P>Captain Devil&s;on, what care I!&mdash;Do you &s;ee how you have di&s;ordered your lady?</P>
<P>Good Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid my charmer, trembling, See, Jack, when &s;he has an end to &s;erve, I am <HI>good</HI> Mr. Lovelace] If&mdash;if my brother,&mdash;if Captain Single|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on &s;hould appear&mdash;Pray now&mdash;I be&s;eech you&mdash;Let me beg of you&mdash;to govern your temper&mdash;My brother is my brother&mdash;Captain Singleton is but an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gent.</HI></P>
<P>My deare&s;t life, folding my arms about her [When

&s;he a&s;ks favours, thought I, the devil's in it, if &s;he will not allow of &s;uch innocent freedoms as this, from <HI>good</HI> Mr. Lovelace too], you &s;hall be witne&s;s of all that pa&s;&s;es between us. Dorcas, de&s;ire the gentle|man to walk up.</P>
<P>Let me retire to my chamber fir&s;t! Let me not be known to be in the hou&s;e!</P>
<P>Charming dear!&mdash;Thou &s;ee&s;t, Belford, &s;he is afraid of leaving me!&mdash;O the little witchcrafts! Were it not for &s;urprize now-and-then, how would an hone&s;t man know where to have them?</P>
<P>She withdrew to li&s;ten&mdash;And tho' this incident has not turned out to an&s;wer all I wi&s;h'd from it, yet is it nece&s;&s;ary, if I would acquaint thee with my whole circulation, to be very particular in what pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Captain Tomlin&s;on and me.</P>
<P><HI>Enter Captain Tomlin&s;on in a riding-dre&s;s, whip in hand.</HI></P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Sir&mdash;Mr. Lovelace, I pre&s;ume?</P>
<P>My name is Lovelace, Sir.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e the Day, Sir.&mdash;Be plea&s;ed to excu&s;e my Garb. I am obliged to go out of town directly, that I may return at night.</P>
<P>The Day is a good day. Your Garb needs no apology.</P>
<P>When I &s;ent my &s;ervant, I did not know that I &s;hould <HI>find time to do my&s;elf this honour.</HI> All that I thought I could do to oblige my friend this journey, was <HI>only</HI> to a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf of your abode; and whether there was a probability of being admitted to your &s;peech, or to your Lady's.</P>
<P>Sir, you know be&s;t your own motives. What your time will permit you to do, you al&s;o be&s;t know. And here I am, attending your plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>My charmer owned afterwards her concern on my be|ing &s;o &s;hort. Whatever I &s;hall mingle of her em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tions, thou wilt ea&s;ily gue&s;s I had afterwards.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="224">Sir, I hope no offence. I intend none.</P>
<P>None&mdash;None at all, Sir.</P>
<P>Sir, I have no intere&s;t in the affair I come about. I may appear officious; and if I thought I &s;hould, I would decline any concern in it, after I have ju&s;t hinted what it is.</P>
<P>And what, pray, Sir, is it?</P>
<P>May I a&s;k you, Sir, without offence, whether you wi&s;h to be reconciled, and to co-operate upon honour|able terms, with <HI>one</HI> gentleman of the name of Har|lowe; preparative, as it may be hoped, to a general reconciliation?</P>
<P><HI>O how my heart flutter'd,</HI> cried my charmer!</P>
<P>I can't tell, Sir [<HI>And then it flutter'd &s;till more, no doubt</HI>]: The whole family have u&s;ed me extremely ill. They have taken greater liberties with my cha|racter than are ju&s;tifiable, and with my family <HI>too</HI>; which I can le&s;s forgive.</P>
<P>Sir, Sir, I have done. I beg pardon for this intru|&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>My Beloved then was ready to &s;ink, and thought very hardly of me.</HI></P>
<P>But pray, Sir, to the immediate purpo&s;e of your pre&s;ent commi&s;&s;ion; &s;ince a commi&s;&s;ion it &s;eems to be?</P>
<P>It <HI>is</HI> a commi&s;&s;ion, Sir; and-&s;uch a one, as I thought would be agreeable to all parties, or I &s;hould not have given my&s;elf concern about it.</P>
<P>Perhaps it <HI>may,</HI> Sir, when known. But let me a&s;k you one previous que&s;tion? Do you know Colonel Morden, Sir?</P>
<P>No, Sir. If you mean <HI>per&s;onally,</HI> I do not. But I have heard my good friend Mr. John Harlowe talk of him with great re&s;pect; and as a co-tru&s;tee with him in a certain tru&s;t.</P>
<P>I thought it probable, Sir, &s;aid I, that the Colonel might be arrived; that you might be a gentleman of
<PB N="218" REF="225">
his acquaintance; and that &s;omething of an agree|able &s;urprize might be intended.</P>
<P>Had Colonel Morden been in England, Mr. John Harlowe would have known it; and then I &s;hould not have been a &s;tranger to it.</P>
<P>Well but, Sir, have you then any commi&s;&s;ion to me from Mr. John Harlowe?</P>
<P>Sir, I will tell you, as briefly as I can, the whole of what I have to &s;ay; but you'll excu&s;e <HI>me</HI> al&s;o a pre|vious que&s;tion, for which curio&s;ity is not my mo|tive; but it is nece&s;&s;ary to be an&s;wered before I can proceed; as you will judge when you hear it.</P>
<P>What, pray, Sir, is your que&s;tion?</P>
<P>Briefly, Whether you are actually, and <HI>bona fide,</HI> married to Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe?</P>
<P>I &s;tarted, and, in a haughty tone, Is this, Sir, a que&s;tion that <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be an&s;wered before you can pro|ceed in the bu&s;ine&s;s you have undertaken?</P>
<P>I mean no offence, Mr. Lovelace. Mr. Harlowe &s;ought to me to undertake this office. I have daugh|ters and nieces of my own. I thought it a good office, or I, who have many con&s;iderable affairs upon my hands, had not accepted of it. I know the world; and will take the liberty to &s;ay, That if that young Lady&mdash;</P>
<P>Captain Tomlin&s;on, I think you are called?</P>
<P>My name is Tomlin&s;on.</P>
<P>Why then, Captain Tomlin&s;on, no <HI>liberty,</HI> as you call it, will be taken well, that is not extremely de|licate, when that lady is mentioned.</P>
<P>When you had heard me out, Mr. Lovelace, and had found, I had &s;o behaved, as to make the caution nece&s;&s;ary, it would have been ju&s;t to have given it.&mdash;Allow me to &s;ay, I know what is due to the character of a woman of virtue, as well as any man alive.</P>
<P>Why, Sir! Why, Captain Tomlin&s;on, you &s;eem warm. If you intend any-thing by this [<HI>O how I trembled!</HI> &s;aid the Lady, <HI>when &s;he took notice of this
<PB N="219" REF="226">
part of our conver&s;ation afterwards:</HI>], I will only &s;ay, that this is a privileged place. It is at pre&s;ent my home, and an a&s;ylum for any gentleman who thinks it worth his while to inquire after me, be the manner or end of his inquiry what it will.</P>
<P>I know not, Sir, that I have given occa&s;ion for this. I make no &s;cruple to attend you <HI>el&s;ewhere,</HI> if I am trouble&s;ome here. I was told, I had a warm young gentleman to deal with: But as I knew my intention, and that my commi&s;&s;ion was an amicable one, I was the le&s;s concerned about that. I am twice your age, Mr. Lovelace, I dare &s;ay: But I do a&s;&s;ure you, that if either my me&s;&s;age, or my manner, give you of|fence, I can &s;u&s;pend the one or the other for a day, or for ever, as you like. And &s;o, Sir, any time be|fore eight to-morrow morning, you will let me know your further commands.&mdash;And was going to tell me where he might be found.</P>
<P>Captain Tomlin&s;on, &s;aid I, you an&s;wer well. I love a man of &s;pirit. Have you not been in the army?</P>
<P>I have, Sir; but have <HI>turned my &s;word into a plough|&s;hare,</HI> as the Scripture has it [<HI>There was a clever fel|low, Jack!&mdash;He was a good man with &s;omebody, I warrant!</HI>].&mdash;And all my delight, added he, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, has been in cultivating my paternal e&s;tate. I love a brave man, Mr. Lovelace, as well as ever I did in my life. But, let me tell you, Sir, that when you come to my time of life, you will be of opinion, that there is not &s;o much true bravery in youthful choler, as you may now think there is.</P>
<P>A clever fellow again, Belford&mdash;Ear and heart, both at once, he took in my charmer.&mdash;<HI>'Tis well,</HI> &s;he &s;ays, <HI>there are &s;ome men who have wi&s;dom in their anger.</HI></P>
<P>Well, Captain, that is reproof for reproof. So we are upon a foot. And now give me the plea&s;ure of hearing your commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir, you mu&s;t fir&s;t allow me to repeat my que&s;tion:
<PB N="220" REF="227">
Are you really, and <HI>bona fide,</HI> married to Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe? Or are you not yet married?</P>
<P>Bluntly put, Captain. But if I an&s;wer that I <HI>am,</HI> what then?</P>
<P>Why then, Sir, I &s;hall &s;ay, that you are a man of honour.</P>
<P>That I hope I am, whether you <HI>&s;ay</HI> it or not, Cap|tain Tomlin&s;on.</P>
<P>Sir, I will be very frank in all I have to &s;ay on this &s;ubject.&mdash;Mr. John Harlowe has lately found out, that you and his niece are both in the &s;ame lodgings; that you have been long &s;o; and that the lady was at the Play with you ye&s;terday was &s;e'ennight; and he hopes, that you are actually married: He has indeed heard that you are; but, as he knows your enter|prizing temper, and that you have declared, that you di&s;dain a relation to their family, he is willing by me to have your marriage confirmed from your own mouth, before he takes the &s;teps he is inclined to take in his niece's favour. You will allow me to &s;ay, Mr. Lovelace, that he will not be &s;atisfied with an an&s;wer that admits of the lea&s;t doubt.</P>
<P>Let me tell you, Captain Tomlin&s;on, that it is a damn'd degree of vilene&s;s for any man to &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir&mdash;Mr. Lovelace&mdash;don't put your&s;elf into a pa&s;|&s;ion. The Lady's relations are jealous of the honour of their family. They have prejudices to overcome as well as you&mdash;Advantage may have been taken&mdash;and the Lady, at the <HI>time,</HI> not to blame.</P>
<P>This Lady, Sir, could give no &s;uch advantages: And if &s;he <HI>had,</HI> what mu&s;t the <HI>man</HI> be, Captain Tom|lin&s;on, who could have taken them?&mdash;Do you know the Lady, Sir?</P>
<P>I never had the honour to &s;ee her but once; and that was at church; and &s;hould not know her again.</P>
<P>Not know her again, Sir!&mdash;I thought that there was not a man living who had once &s;een her, and would not know her among a thou&s;and.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="228">I remember, Sir, that I thought I never &s;aw a finer woman in my life. But, Mr. Lovelace, I believe, you will allow, that it is better that her relations &s;hould have wronged <HI>you,</HI> than you the <HI>Lady.</HI> I hope, Sir, you will permit me to repeat my que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>Enter Dorcas, in a hurry.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>gentleman,</HI> this minute, Sir, de&s;ires to &s;peak with your honour&mdash;<HI>My Lady, Sir!&mdash;[A&s;ide.</HI></P>
<P>Could the dear creature put <HI>Dorcas</HI> upon telling this fib, yet want to &s;ave <HI>me</HI> one?&mdash;</P>
<P>De&s;ire the gentleman to walk into one of the par|lours. I will wait on him pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>[<HI>Exit Dorcas.</HI></P>
<P>The dear creature, I doubted not, wanted to in|&s;truct me how to an&s;wer the Captain's home-put. I knew how I intended to an&s;wer it&mdash;Plumb&punc; thou may'&s;t be &s;ure&mdash;But Dorcas's me&s;&s;age &s;tagger'd me. And yet I was upon one of my ma&s;ter-&s;trokes&mdash;Which was, To take advantage of the Captain's inquiries, and to make her own her marriage before him, as &s;he had done to the people below; and if &s;he had been brought to that, to induce her, for her uncle's &s;atisfaction, to write him a letter of gratitude; which of cour&s;e mu&s;t have been &s;igned <HI>Clari&s;&s;a Lovelace.</HI> I was loth, therefore, thou may'&s;t believe, to attend her &s;udden commands: And yet, afraid of pu&s;hing matters be|yond recovery with her, I thought proper to lead him from the que&s;tion, to account for him&s;elf; for Mr. Harlowe's coming at the knowlege of where we are; and for other particulars which I knew would engage her attention; and which might po&s;&s;ibly convince her of the nece&s;&s;ity there was for her to acquie&s;ce in the affirmative I was di&s;po&s;ed to give. And this for her own &s;ake; for what; as I a&s;ked her afterwards, is it to me, whether I am ever reconciled to a family I mu&s;t for ever de&s;pi&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="229">You think, Captain, that I have an&s;wered doubt|fully to the que&s;tion you have put. You <HI>may</HI> think &s;o. And you mu&s;t know, that I have a good deal of pride: And only, that you are a gentleman, and &s;eem in this affair to be governed by generous principles, or I &s;hould ill brook being interrogated as to my honour to a lady &s;o dear to me.&mdash;But before I an&s;wer more directly to the point, pray &s;atisfy me in a que&s;tion or two that I &s;hall put to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>With all my heart, Sir. A&s;k me what que&s;tions you plea&s;e, I will an&s;wer them with &s;incerity and can|dour.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, That Mr. Harlowe has found out that we were at a Play together: And that we are both in the &s;ame lodgings&mdash;How pray, came he at his know|lege?&mdash;For, let me tell you, that I have, for certain con&s;iderations not re&s;pecting my&s;elf, conde&s;cended, that our abode &s;hould be kept &s;ecret. And this has been &s;o &s;trictly ob&s;erved, that even Mi&s;s Howe, tho' &s;he and my beloved corre&s;pond, knows not directly whither to &s;end to us.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, the per&s;on who &s;aw you at the Play, was a tenant of Mr. John Harlowe. He watched all your motions. When the Play was done, he follow|ed your coach to your lodgings. And early the next day, Sunday, he took hor&s;e, and acquainted his land|lord with what he had ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>How oddly things come about, Captain Tomlin|&s;on!&mdash;But does any other of the Harlowes know where we are?</P>
<P>It is an ab&s;olute &s;ecret to every other per&s;on of the family; and &s;o it is intended to be kept: As al&s;o that Mr. John Harlowe is willing to enter into treaty with you, by me, if his niece be actually married; for perhaps he is aware, that he &s;hall have difficulty enough with &s;ome people to bring about the de&s;irable
<PB N="223" REF="230">
reconciliation, altho' he could give them this a&s;|&s;urance.</P>
<P>I doubt it not, Captain.&mdash;To James Harlowe is all the family folly owing.&mdash;Fine fools!

<P>I will tell you, Mr. Lovelace, and the occa&s;ion; and be very explicit upon it, and upon all that con|cerns you to know of me, and of the commi&s;&s;ion I have undertaken; and this the rather, as when you have heard me out, you will be &s;atisfied, that I am not an officious man in this my pre&s;ent addre&s;s to you.</P>
<P>I am all attention, Captain Tomlin&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>And &s;o I doubt not was my beloved.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You mu&s;t know, Sir, &s;aid the Captain, that I have not been many months in Mr. John Har|lowe's neighbourhood.

And then he told me, that he had had an application made to him two or three days before by a gentle|man whom he named <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Mi&s;s Howe's Letters, Numb. <HI>iv.</HI> p. <HI>19.</HI> and Numb. <HI>x.</HI> p. <HI>37.</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>, to induce him not only to be reconciled to his niece him&s;elf, but to forward for her a general reconciliation.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A like application, he told me, had been made to his &s;i&s;ter Harlowe, by a good woman whom every-body re&s;pected; who had intimated, that his niece, if encouraged, would again put her&s;elf into the protection of her friends, and leave you: But if not, that &s;he mu&s;t unavoidably be yours.'</Q></P>
<P>I hope, Mr. Lovelace, I make no mi&s;chief.&mdash;You look concerned&mdash;You &s;igh, Sir.</P>
<P>Proceed, Captain Tomlin&s;on. Pray proceed.&mdash;<HI>And I &s;ighed &s;till more profoundly.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'They all thought it extremely particular, that a lady &s;hould decline marriage with a man &s;he had &s;o lately gone away with.'</Q></P>
<P>Pray, Captain&mdash;Pray, Mr. Tomlin&s;on&mdash;No more of this &s;ubject. My beloved is an angel. In every thing unblameable. Whatever faults there have been, have been theirs and mine. What you would further &s;ay, is, that the <HI>unforgiving</HI> family rejected her appli|cation. They did. She and I had had a mi&s;under|&s;tanding.
<PB N="225" REF="232">
<HI>The falling out of lovers</HI>&mdash;you know, Captain.&mdash;We have been happier ever &s;ince.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Well, Sir; but Mr. John Harlowe could not but better con&s;ider the matter afterwards. And he de&s;ired my advice how to act in it. He told me, that no father ever loved a daughter as he loved this niece of his; whom, indeed, he u&s;ed to call his <HI>daughter-niece.</HI> He &s;aid, &s;he had really been un|kindly treated by her brother and &s;i&s;ter: And as your alliance, Sir, was far from being a di&s;credit to their family, he would do his endeavour to recon|cile all parties, if he could be &s;ure that ye were ac|tually man and wife.'</Q></P>
<P>And what, pray, Captain, was your advice?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I gave it as my opinion, that if his niece were un|worthily treated, and in di&s;tre&s;s, as he apprehended from the application to him, he would &s;oon hear of her again: But that it was likely, that this applica|tion was made without expecting it would &s;ucceed; and as a &s;alvo only, to her&s;elf, for marrying without their con&s;ent. And the rather, as he had told me, that it came from a young lady her friend, and not in a direct way from her&s;elf; which young lady was no favourite of the family; and therefore would hardly have been employed, had &s;ucce&s;s been ex|pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed.'</Q></P>
<P>Very well, Captain Tomlin&s;on.&mdash;Pray proceed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Here the matter re&s;ted till la&s;t Sunday evening, when Mr. John Harlowe came to me with the man who had &s;een you and your lady (as I hope &s;he is) at the Play; and who had a&s;&s;ured him, that you both lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e.&mdash;And then the ap|plication having been &s;o lately made, which im|plied, that you were not then married, he was &s;o unea&s;y for his niece's honour, that I advi&s;ed him to di&s;patch to town &s;ome one in whom he could con|fide, to make proper inquiries.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="233">Very well, Captain.&mdash;And was &s;uch a per&s;on em|ployed on &s;uch an errand by her uncle?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A tru&s;ty and di&s;creet per&s;on was accordingly &s;ent; and la&s;t Tue&s;day, I think it was (for he returned to us on the Wedne&s;day), he made the inquiries among the neighbours fir&s;t [<HI>The very inquiry, Jack, that gave us all &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>180.</HI> of this Vol.</NOTE>]. But finding, that none of them could give any &s;atisfactory ac|count, the lady's woman was come at, who de|clared, that you were actually married. But the inquiri&s;t keeping him&s;elf on the re&s;erve as to his employers, the girl refu&s;ed to tell the day, or to give him other particulars.'</Q></P>
<P>You give a very clear account of every-thing, Cap|tain Tomlin&s;on. Pray go on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The gentleman returned; and on his report Mr. Harlowe, having &s;till doubts, and being willing to proceed on &s;ome grounds in &s;o important a point, be&s;ought me, as my affairs called me frequently to town, to undertake this matter. You, Mr. Tomlin&s;on, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, have children of your own: You know the world: You know what I drive at: You will proceed, I know, with under|&s;tanding and &s;pirit: And whatever you are &s;atisfied with, &s;hall &s;atisfy me.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Enter Dorcas, again in a hurry.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, The gentleman is impatient.</P>
<P>I will attend him pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The Captain then accounted for his not calling in per&s;on, when he had rea&s;on to think us here.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he had bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence a few miles out of town, whither he thought he mu&s;t have gone ye&s;terday; and having been obliged to put off his little journey till this day, and under&s;tanding that we were within, not knowing whether he &s;hould have &s;uch another opportunity, he was willing to try his
<PB N="227" REF="234">
good fortune before he &s;et out; and this made him come booted and &s;purred, as I &s;aw him.</P>
<P>He dropped a hint in commendation of the people of the hou&s;e; but it was in &s;uch away, as to give no room for &s;u&s;picion, that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make any inquiries after the character of per&s;ons who make &s;o genteel an appearance, as he ob&s;erved they do.</P>
<P>And here let me remark, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, that my beloved might collect another circum&s;tance in their favour, had &s;he doubted them, from the &s;ilence of her uncle's inquiri&s;t on Tue&s;day, among the neigh|bours.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, &s;aid he, that I believe I have &s;ati&s;|fied you in every thing relating to my commi&s;&s;ion, I hope you will permit me to repeat my que&s;tion&mdash;which is,&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Enter Dorcas again, out of breath.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, the gentleman will &s;tep up to <HI>you.&mdash;My lady is impatient. She wonders at your honour's delay, [A&s;ide].</HI></P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Captain, for one moment.</P>
<P>I have &s;taid my full time, Mr. Lovelace.&mdash;What may re&s;ult from my que&s;tion and your an&s;wer, what|ever it &s;hall be, may take us up time.&mdash;And you are engaged.&mdash;Will you permit me to attend you in the morning, before I &s;et out on my return?</P>
<P>You will then breakfa&s;t with me, Captain?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be early if I do. I mu&s;t reach my own hou&s;e to-morrow night, or I &s;hall make the be&s;t of wives unhappy. And I have two or three places to call at in my way.</P>
<P>It &s;hall be by &s;even o'clock, if you plea&s;e, Captain. We are early folks. And this I will tell you, that if ever I am reconciled to a family &s;o implacable as I have always found the Harlowes to be, it mu&s;t be by the mediation of &s;o cool and &s;o moderate a gentle|man as your&s;elf.</P>
<P>And &s;o, with the highe&s;t civilities on both &s;ides, we

parted. But for the private &s;atisfaction of &s;o good a man, I left him out of doubt, that we were man and wife, tho' I did not directly aver it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XL. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday Night.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Captain Tomlin&s;on is one of the happie&s;t, as well as one of the be&s;t men in the world. What would I give to &s;tand as high in my beloved's opinion, as he does! But yet, I am as good a man as he, were I to tell my own &s;tory, and have equal credit given to it. But the devil &s;hould have had him before I had &s;een him on the account he came upon, had I thought I &s;hould not have an&s;wered my princi|pal end in it.&mdash;I hinted to thee in my la&s;t what that was.</P>
<P>But to the particulars of the conference between my fair one, and me, on her ha&s;ty me&s;&s;ages; which I was loth to come to, becau&s;e &s;he has had a half triumph over me in it.</P>
<P>After I had attended the Captain down to the very pa&s;&s;age, I returned to the dining-room, and put on a joyful air, on my beloved's entrance into it.&mdash;O my deare&s;t creature, let me congratulate you on a pro|&s;pect &s;o agreeable to your wi&s;hes!&mdash;And I &s;natched her hand, and &s;mothered it with my ki&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I was going on; when, interrupting me,&mdash;You &s;ee, Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid &s;he, how you have embara&s;&s;ed your&s;elf, by your own obliquities!&mdash;You &s;ee, that you have not been able to return a direct an&s;wer to a plain and hone&s;t que&s;tion, tho' upon it depends all the happine&s;s you congratulate me upon the pro&s;pect of.</P>
<P>You know, my be&s;t love, what my prudent, and I will &s;ay, my <HI>kind</HI> motives were, for giving out, that we were married. You &s;ee, that I have taken
<PB N="229" REF="236">
no advantage of it; and that no inconvenience has followed it.&mdash;You &s;ee; that your uncle wants only to be a&s;&s;ured from our&s;elves, that it is &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P>Not another word to this purpo&s;e, Mr. Lovelace. I will not only ri&s;k, but I will forfeit, the reconcilia|tion &s;o near my heart, rather than I will go on to countenance a &s;tory &s;o untrue!</P>
<P>My deare&s;t &s;oul&mdash;Would you have me appear&mdash;</P>
<P>I would have you appear, Sir, as <HI>you are!</HI> I am re&s;olved that I will appear to my uncle's friend, and to my uncle, as <HI>I am.</HI></P>
<P>For one week, my deare&s;t life, cannot you for one week, only till the &s;ettlements&mdash;</P>
<P>Not for one hour, with my own con&s;ent.&mdash;You don't know, Sir, how much I have been afflicted, that I have appeared to the people below what I am not. But my uncle, Sir, &s;hall never have it to up|braid me, nor will I to upbraid my&s;elf, that I have wilfully pa&s;&s;ed my&s;elf upon him in fal&s;e lights.</P>
<P>What, my dear, would you have me to &s;ay to the Captain to-morrow morning?&mdash;I have given him room to think&mdash;</P>
<P>Then put him right, Mr. Lovelace. Tell the truth. Tell him what you plea&s;e of your relations favour to me: Tell him what you will about the &s;ettlements: And if when drawn, you will &s;ubmit them to his peru&s;al and approbation, it will &s;hew him how much you are in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t life&mdash;Do you think, that he would di&s;approve of the terms I have offer'd?&mdash;No.</P>
<P>Then may I be accur&s;ed, if I willingly &s;ubmit to be trampled under foot by my enemies!</P>
<P>And may I, Mr. Lovelace, never be happy in this life, if I &s;ubmit to the pa&s;&s;ing upon my uncle Har|lowe a wilful and premeditated fal&s;hood for truth!&mdash;I have too long laboured under the affliction which the rejection of all my friends has given me, to pur|cha&s;e
<PB N="230" REF="237">
their reconciliation now at &s;o dear a price as at that of my veracity.</P>
<P>The women below, my dear&mdash;</P>
<P>What are they to me?&mdash;I want not to e&s;tabli&s;h my&s;elf with them. Need they know all that pa&s;&s;es between my relations and you and me?</P>
<P>Neither are they any thing to me, Madam. Only, that when, for the &s;ake of preventing the fatal mi&s;|chiefs which might have attended your brother's pro|jects, I have made them think us married, I would not appear to them in a light, which you your&s;elf think &s;o &s;hocking. By my &s;oul, Madam, I had ra|ther die, than contradict my&s;elf &s;o flagrantly, after I have related to them &s;o many circum&s;tances of our marriage.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, the women may believe what they plea&s;e. That I have given countenance to what you told them, is my error. The many circum&s;tances which you own <HI>one</HI> untruth has drawn you in to re|late, is a ju&s;tification of my refu&s;al in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Don't you &s;ee, Madam, that your uncle wi&s;hes to find us married? May not the ceremony be privately over, before his mediation can take place?</P>
<P>Urge this point no farther, Mr. Lovelace. If <HI>you</HI> will not tell the truth, <HI>I</HI> will to-morrow morning, if I &s;ee Captain Tomlin&s;on, tell it my&s;elf. Indeed I will.</P>
<P>Will you, Madam, con&s;ent, that things pa&s;s as before with the people below? This mediation of Tomlin&s;on <HI>may</HI> come to nothing. Your brother's &s;chemes <HI>may</HI> be pur&s;ued; the rather, that now he will know (perhaps from your uncle), that you are not under a legal protection.&mdash;You will, at lea&s;t, con&s;ent, that things pa&s;s <HI>here</HI> as before?</P>
<P>To permit this, is to go on in an error, Mr. Love|lace. But as the occa&s;ion for &s;o doing (if there <HI>can</HI> be an occa&s;ion in your opinion, that will warrant an untruth), will, as I pre&s;ume, &s;oon be over, I &s;hall the
<PB N="231" REF="238">
le&s;s di&s;pute that point with you. But a new error I will not be guilty of, if I can avoid it.</P>
<P>Can I, do you think, Madam, have any di&s;|honourable view in the &s;tep I &s;uppo&s;ed you would not &s;cruple to take towards a reconciliation with your own family?&mdash;Not for <HI>my own</HI> &s;ake, you know, did I hope you to take it.&mdash;For what is it to me, if I am never reconciled to your family? I want no favours from them.</P>
<P>I hope, Mr. Lovelace, there is no occa&s;ion, in our pre&s;ent <HI>not</HI> di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, to an&s;wer &s;uch a que&s;tion. And let me &s;ay, that I &s;hall think my pro&s;pects &s;till more agreeable, if, to-morrow morn|ing, you will not only own the very truth, but give my uncle's friend &s;uch an account of the &s;teps you have taken, and are taking, as may keep up my uncle's favourable intentions towards me. This you may do under what re&s;trictions of &s;ecrecy you plea&s;e. Cap|tain Tomlin&s;on is a prudent man; a promoter of fa|mily-peace, you find; and, I dare &s;ay, may be made a friend.</P>
<P>I &s;aw there was no help. I &s;aw that the inflexible Harlowe &s;pirit was all up in her.&mdash;A little witch!&mdash;A little&mdash;Forgive me, Love, for calling her names: And &s;o I &s;aid, with an air, We have had too many mi&s;under&s;tandings, Madam, for me to wi&s;h for new ones; I will obey you without re&s;erve. Had I not thought I &s;hould have obliged you by the other me|thod (e&s;pecially as the ceremony might have been over, before any thing could have operated from your uncle's intentions, and of con&s;equence no un|truth per&s;i&s;ted in), I would not have propo&s;ed it.&mdash;But think not, my beloved creature, that you &s;hall enjoy, without condition, this triumph over my judgment.</P>
<P>And then, cla&s;ping my arms about her, I gave her &s;truggled-away cheek (her charming lip de&s;igned) a &s;ervent ki&s;s.&mdash;And your forgivene&s;s of this &s;weet freedom (bowing) is that condition.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239">She was not mortally offended.&mdash;And now mu&s;t I make out the re&s;t as well as I can. But this I will tell thee, that altho' her triumph has not dimini&s;hed my love for her; yet has it &s;timulated me more than ever to Revenge, as thou wilt be apt to call it. But Victory or Conque&s;t is the more proper name.</P>
<P>There is a plea&s;ure, 'tis true, in &s;ubduing one of the&s;e watchful beauties. But, by my &s;oul, Belford, men of our ca&s;t take twenty times the pains to be rogues, that it would co&s;t them to be hone&s;t; and dear|ly, with the &s;weat of our brows, and to the puzzling of our brains (to &s;ay nothing of the hazards we run), do we earn our purcha&s;e: And ought not therefore to be grudged our &s;ucce&s;s, when we meet with it&mdash;E&s;pecially as, when we have obtained our end, &s;a|tiety &s;oon follows; and leaves us little or nothing to &s;hew for it. But this, indeed, may be &s;aid of all worldly delights.&mdash;And is not that a grave reflection from me?</P>
<P>I was willing to write up to the time. Altho' I have not carried my principal point, I &s;hall make &s;omething turn out in my favour from Captain Tom|lin&s;on's errand.&mdash;But let me give thee this caution; that thou do not pretend to judge of my devices by <HI>parts</HI>; but have patience till thou &s;ee&s;t the <HI>whole.</HI> But once more I &s;wear, that I will not be <HI>out-Norris'd</HI> by a pair of novices. And yet I am very apprehen&s;ive, at times, of the con&s;equences of Mi&s;s Howe's Smug|gling &s;cheme.</P>
<P>'Tis late, or rather early; for the day begins to dawn upon me. I am plaguy heavy. Perhaps I need not to have told thee that. But will only indulge a doze in my chair, for an hour; then &s;hake my&s;elf, wa&s;h, and refre&s;h. At my time of life, with my con&s;titution, that's all that's wanted.</P>
<P>Good night to me!&mdash;It cannot be broad day till I am awake.&mdash;Aw-w-w-w-haugh&mdash;Pox of this yawn|ing!</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="240">Is not thy uncle dead yet?</P>
<P>What's come to mine, that he writes not to my la&s;t!&mdash;Hunting after more <HI>wi&s;dom of nations,</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e!&mdash;Yaw&mdash;Yaw&mdash;Yawning again!&mdash;Pen, begone.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, May</HI> 29.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOW have I e&s;tabli&s;hed my&s;elf for ever in my charmer's heart.</P>
<P>The Captain came at &s;even, as promi&s;ed, and ready equipped for his journey. My beloved cho&s;e not to give us her company till our fir&s;t conver&s;ation was over.&mdash;A&s;hamed, I &s;uppo&s;e [But to my &s;hame, if &s;he was], to be pre&s;ent at that part of it, which was to re&s;tore her to her virgin &s;tate, by my confe&s;&s;ion, after her <HI>wifehood</HI> had been reported to her uncle. But &s;he took her cue neverthele&s;s, and li&s;tened to all that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The mode&s;te&s;t women, Jack, mu&s;t <HI>think,</HI> and think deeply &s;ometimes.&mdash;I wonder whether they ever blu&s;h at tho&s;e things by them&s;elves, at which they have &s;o charming a knack of blu&s;hing in com|pany.&mdash;If not; and if blu&s;hing be a &s;ign of grace or mode&s;ty, have not the &s;ex as great a command over their blu&s;hes, as they are &s;aid to have over their tears? This reflection would lead me a great way into female minds, were I di&s;po&s;ed to pur&s;ue it.</P>
<P>I told the Captain, that I would prevent his que|&s;tion; and accordingly, after I had injoined the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ecrecy, that no advantage might be given to James Harlowe; and which he an&s;wered for as well on Mr. Harlowe's part as his own; I acknowleged nakedly and fairly the whole truth.&mdash;To wit,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That we were not yet married.&mdash;I gave him hints of the cau&s;es of procra&s;tination.&mdash;Some of them owing to
<PB N="234" REF="241">
unhappy mi&s;under&s;tanding: But chiefly to the La|dy's de&s;ire of previous reconciliation with her friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and to a delicacy that had no example.'</Q></P>
<P>Le&s;s nice ladies than this, Jack, love to have de|lays, wilful and <HI>&s;tudied</HI> delays, imputed to them in the&s;e ca&s;es&mdash;Yet are indelicate in their affected deli|cacy; for do they not thereby tacitly confe&s;s, that they expect to be the greate&s;t gainers in wedlock; and that there is <HI>&s;elf-denial</HI> in the pride they take in delaying?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I told him the rea&s;on of our pa&s;&s;ing to the people below as marry'd&mdash;Yet as under a vow of re&s;triction&punc; as to con&s;ummation, which had kept us both to the height, one of <HI>&s;orbearing,</HI> the other of <HI>vigilant</HI> punctilio; even to the denial of tho&s;e innocent free|doms, which betrothed lovers never &s;cruple to allow and to take.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I then communicated to him a copy of my pro|po&s;als of &s;ettlement; the &s;ub&s;tance of her written an&s;wer; the contents of my letter of invitation to Lord M. to be her nuptial father; and of my Lord's generous reply. But &s;aid, that having apprehen|&s;ions of delay from his infirmities, and my beloved choo&s;ing by all means (and that from principles of <HI>unrequited</HI> duty) a private &s;olemnization, I had written to excu&s;e his lord&s;hip's pre&s;ence; and ex|pected an an&s;wer every hour.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The &s;ettlements, I told him, were actually draw|ing by coun&s;ellor Williams, of who&s;e eminence he mu&s;t have heard [He had]; and of the truth of this he might &s;atisfy him&s;elf before he went out of town.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'When the&s;e were drawn, approved, and ingro&s;&s;|ed, nothing, I &s;aid, but &s;igning, and the nomination of my happy day, would be wanting. I had a pride, I declared, in doing the highe&s;t ju&s;tice to &s;o beloved a creature, of my own voluntary motion, and with|out the intervention of a family from whom I had received the greate&s;t in&s;ults. And this being our
<PB N="235" REF="242">
pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I was contented, that Mr. John Harlowe &s;hould &s;u&s;pend his reconciliatory purpo&s;es till our marriage were actually &s;olemnized.'</Q></P>
<P>The Captain was highly delighted with all I had &s;aid: Yet owned, that as his dear friend Mr. Harlowe had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xpre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf greatly plea&s;ed to hear that we were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctually marry'd, he could have wi&s;hed it <HI>had</HI> been &s;o. But, neverthele&s;s, he doubted not that all would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell.</P>
<P>He &s;aw my rea&s;ons, he &s;aid, and approved of them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or making the gentlewomen below (whom again he <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nder&s;tood to be good &s;ort of people</HI>) believe, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eremony had pa&s;&s;ed; which &s;o well accounted for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the Lady's maid had told Mr. Harlowe's friend. Mr. James Harlowe, he &s;aid, had certainly ends to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;wer in keeping open the breach; and <HI>as</HI> certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad formed a de&s;ign to get his &s;i&s;ter out of my hands.

<P>AND now it is time to confe&s;s (and yet I know, that thy conjectures are aforehand with my ex|po&s;ition), that this Captain Tomlin&s;on, who is &s;o great a favourite with my charmer, and who takes &s;o much delight in healing breaches, and reconciling differ|ences, is neither a greater man nor a le&s;s, than hone&s;t Patrick M^cDonald, attended by a di&s;carded footman of his own finding out.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t what a various-lifed ra&s;cal he is; and to what better hopes born and educated. But that ingenious knack of Forgery, for which he was expell|ed the Dublin-Univer&s;ity, and a detection &s;ince in Evidence&s;hip, have been his ruin.

as this, when, as thou ha&s;t told me, the Lady u&s;ed to be a month at a time at this uncle's; and mu&s;t therefore, in all probability, know, that there was not a Captain Tomlin&s;on in all his neighbour|hood; at lea&s;t no one of the name &s;o intimate with him, as this man pretends to be?'</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>This objection, Jack, is &s;o natural a one, that I could not help ob&s;erving to my charmer, that &s;he mu&s;t &s;urely have heard her uncle &s;peak of this gentleman. No, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he never had.

<P>Do&s;t thou not &s;ee, however, that this hou&s;ekeeper knows nothing, nor is to know any thing, of the treaty of reconciliation de&s;igned to be &s;et on foot; and therefore the Uncle always comes to the Captain, the Captain goes not to the Uncle: And this I &s;ur|mi&s;ed to the Lady. And then it was a natural &s;ug|ge&s;tion, that the Captain was the rather applied to, as he is a &s;tranger to the re&s;t of the family: Need I tell thee the meaning of all this?</P>

<P>I Have a letter from Lord M. Such a one as I would wi&s;h for, if I intended matrimony. But as matters are circum&s;tanced, I cannot think of &s;hew|ing it to my Beloved.</P>
<P>My Lord regrets,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that he is not to be the Lady's nuptial father. He &s;eems apprehen&s;ive that I have
<PB N="248" REF="255">
&s;till, &s;pecious as my rea&s;ons are, &s;ome mi&s;chief in my head.'</Q></P>
<P>He graciou&s;ly con&s;ents,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that I may marry when I plea&s;e; and offers one or both of my cou&s;ins to a&s;&s;i&s;t my bride, and to &s;upport her &s;pirits on the oc|ca&s;ion; &s;ince, as he under&s;tands, &s;he is &s;o much afraid to venture with me.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Pritchard, he tells me, has his final orders to draw up deeds, to a&s;&s;ign over to me in perpetuity 1000 <HI>l. per annum</HI>; which he will execute the &s;ame hour that the Lady in per&s;on owns her marriage.'</Q></P>
<P>He con&s;ents,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that the jointure be made from my own e&s;tate.'</Q></P>
<P>He wi&s;hes,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that the Lady would have accepted of his draught; and commends me for tendering it to her. But reproaches me for pride in not keeping it my&s;elf. <HI>What the right-&s;ide gives up, the left,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>may be the better for.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>The girls, he means.</P>
<P>With all my heart. If I can have Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, the devil take every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>A good deal of other &s;tuff writes this &s;tupid Peer; &s;cribbling in &s;everal places half a dozen lines, appa|rently for no other rea&s;on, but to bring in as many mu&s;ty words in an old &s;aw.</P>
<P>If thou a&s;ke&s;t, How I can manage, &s;ince my Be|loved will wonder, that I have not an an&s;wer from my Lord to &s;uch a letter as I wrote to him; and if I own I have one, will expect that I &s;hould &s;hew it to her, as I did my letter?&mdash;This I an&s;wer&mdash;That I can: be informed by Pritchard, that my Lord has the gout in his right-hand; and has ordered him to attend me in form, for my particular orders about the tran&s;|fer: And I can &s;ee Pritchard, thou knowe&s;t, at the King's Arms, or where I plea&s;e in town; and he, by word of mouth, can acquaint me with everything in my Lord's letter that is nece&s;&s;ary for her to know.</P>
<P>Whenever it &s;uits me, I can re&s;tore the old Peer to
<PB N="249" REF="256">
his right hand, and then can make him write a much more &s;en&s;ible letter than this he has how &s;ent me.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t, that an adroitne&s;s in the art of <HI>ma|nual imitation,</HI> was one of my earlie&s;t attainments. It has been &s;aid, on this occa&s;ion, that had I been a <HI>bad</HI> man in <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum</HI> matters, I &s;hould not have been fit to live. As to the girls, we hold it no &s;in to cheat them. And are we not told, that in being <HI>well</HI> deceived con&s;i&s;ts the whole of human happine&s;s?</P>

<P>ALL &s;till happier and happier. A very high honour done me: A chariot, in&s;tead of a coach, permitted, purpo&s;ely to indulge me in the &s;ubject of &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Our di&s;cour&s;e in this &s;weet airing turned upon our future manner of life. The day is ba&s;hfully promi&s;ed me. <HI>Soon,</HI> was the an&s;wer to my repeated urgency. Our equipage, our &s;ervants, our liveries, were parts of the delightful &s;ubject. A de&s;ire that the wretch who had given me intelligence out of the family [hone&s;t Jo&s;eph Leman] might not be one of our menials; and her re&s;olution to have her faithful Hannah, whe|ther recovered or not; were &s;ignified; and both as readily a&s;&s;ented to.</P>
<P>The reconciliation pro&s;pect was enlarged upon. If her uncle Harlowe will but pave the way to it, and if it can be brought about, &s;he &s;hall be happy.&mdash;Happy, with a &s;igh, <HI>as it is Now po&s;&s;ible &s;he can be!</HI>&mdash;She won't forbear, Jack!</P>
<P>I told her, that I had heard from Pritchard, ju&s;t be|fore we &s;et out, and expected him in town to-morrow from Lord M. to take my directions. I &s;poke with gratitude of my Lord's kindne&s;s to me; and with plea&s;ure of my aunt's and cou&s;in's veneration for her: As al&s;o of his Lord&s;hip's concern that his gout hin|der'd him from writing a reply with his own hand to my la&s;t.</P>
<P>She pitied my Lord. She pitied poor Mrs. Fretcli|ville
<PB N="250" REF="257">
too; for &s;he had the goodne&s;s to inquire after her. The dear creature pitied every-body that &s;eemed to want pity. Happy in her own pro&s;pects, &s;he has lei|&s;ure to look abroad, and wi&s;hes every-body equally happy.</P>
<P>It is likely to go very hard with Mrs. Fretchville. Her face, which &s;he had valued her&s;elf upon, will be utterly ruin'd. This good, however, &s;he may reap from &s;o great an evil:&mdash;As the greater malady generally &s;wallows up the le&s;s, &s;he may have a grief on this occa&s;ion, that may dimini&s;h the other grief, and make it tolerable.</P>
<P>I had a gentle reprimand for this light turn on &s;o heavy an evil.&mdash;For what was the lo&s;s of beauty to the lo&s;s of a good hu&s;band?&mdash;Excellent creature!</P>
<P>Her hopes, and her plea&s;ure upon tho&s;e hopes, that Mi&s;s Howe's mother would be reconciled to her, were al&s;o mentioned. <HI>Good</HI> Mrs. Howe was her word, for a woman &s;o covetous, and &s;o remor&s;ele&s;s in her cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, that no one el&s;e would call her <HI>good.</HI> But this dear creature has &s;uch an exten&s;ion in her love, as to be capable of valuing the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant animal related to tho&s;e whom &s;he re&s;pects. <HI>Love me, and love my dog,</HI> I have heard Lord M. &s;ay.&mdash;Who knows, but that I may in time, in compliment to my&s;elf, bring her to think well of thee, Jack?</P>
<P>But what am I about?&mdash;Am I not all this time arraigning my own heart?&mdash;I know I am, by the re|mor&s;e I feel in it, while my pen bears te&s;timony to her excellence. But yet I mu&s;t add (for no &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ideration &s;hall hinder me from doing ju&s;tice to this admirable creature), that in this conver&s;ation &s;he de|mon&s;trated &s;o much prudent knowlege in every thing that relates to that part of the dome&s;tic management, which falls under the care of a mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, that I believe &s;he has no equal of her years in the world.</P>
<P><HI>I break off, to re-peru&s;e &s;ome of Mi&s;s Howe's viru|lence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="258"><HI>Cur&s;ed letters, the&s;e of Mi&s;s Howe, Jack!&mdash;Do thou turn back to tho&s;e of mine, where I take notice of them.</HI>&mdash;I proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>Upon the whole, my charmer was all gentlene&s;s, all ea&s;e, all &s;erenity, throughout this &s;weet excur&s;ion. Nor had &s;he rea&s;on to be otherwi&s;e: For it being the fir&s;t time that I had the honour of her company <HI>&s;ola,</HI> I was re&s;olved to encourage her, by my re&s;pectful|ne&s;s, to repeat the favour.</P>
<P>On our return, I found the coun&s;ellor's clerk waiting for me, with a draught of the marriage-&s;ettlements.</P>
<P>They are drawn, with only the nece&s;&s;ary variations, from tho&s;e made for my mother. The original of which (now returned by the coun&s;ellor), as well as the new draughts, I have put into my Beloved's hands.</P>
<P>This made the lawyer's work ea&s;y; nor can &s;he have a better precedent; the great Lord S. having &s;ettled them, at the reque&s;t of my mother's relations; all the difference, my charmer's are 100 <HI>l. per annum</HI> more than my mother's.</P>
<P>I offer'd to read to her the old deed, while &s;he looked over the draught; for &s;he had refu&s;ed her pre&s;ence at the examination with the clerk: But this &s;he al&s;o de|clined.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he did not care to hear of &s;o many chil|dren, fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, fourth, fifth, &s;ixth, and &s;eventh &s;ons, and as many daughters, <HI>to be begotten upon the body of the &s;aid Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe.</HI></P>
<P>Charming matrimonial recitativoes!&mdash;tho' it is al|ways &s;aid <HI>lawfully begotten</HI> too&mdash;As if a man could beget children <HI>unlawfully</HI> upon the body of his own wife.&mdash;But thinke&s;t thou not that the&s;e arch rogues the lawyers hereby intimate, that a man may have children by his wife <HI>before</HI> marriage?&mdash;This mu&s;t be what they mean. Why will the&s;e &s;ly fellows put an hone&s;t man in mind of &s;uch rogueries?&mdash;But hence,
<PB N="252" REF="259">
as in numberle&s;s other in&s;tances, we &s;ee, that <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> are two very different things.</P>
<P>Dorcas, in our ab&s;ence, tried to get at the wain|&s;cot box in the dark clo&s;et. But it cannot be done without violence. And to run a ri&s;que of con&s;e|quence now, for mere curio&s;ity-&s;ake, would be inex|cu&s;able.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sinclair and the nymphs are all of opinion, that I am now &s;o much of a favourite, and have &s;uch a vi&s;ible &s;hare in her confidence, and even in her affec|tions, that I may do what I will, and plead violence of <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI>; which, they will have it, makes violence of <HI>action</HI> pardonable with their &s;ex; as well as an al|lowed extenuation with the unconcerned of both &s;exes; and they all offer their helping hands. Why not? they &s;ay: Has &s;he not pa&s;&s;ed for my wife before them all?&mdash;And is &s;he not in a fine way of being re|conciled to her friends; which was the pretence for po&s;tponing con&s;ummation?</P>
<P>They again urge me, &s;ince it is &s;o difficult to make <HI>night</HI> my friend, to an attempt in the <HI>day.</HI> They re|mind me, that the &s;ituation of their hou&s;e is &s;uch, that no noi&s;es can be heard out of it; and ridicule me for making it nece&s;&s;ary for a lady to be undre&s;&s;ed. It was not always &s;o with me, poor old man! Sally told me; &s;aucily flinging her handkerchief in my face.</P>

<P>NOtwith&s;tanding my &s;tudied for politene&s;s and complai&s;ance for &s;ome days pa&s;t; and though I have wanted courage to throw the ma&s;k quite a&s;ide; yet I have made the dear creature more than once look about her, by the warm, tho' decent expre&s;&s;ions of my pa&s;&s;ion. I have brought her to own, that I am
<PB N="253" REF="260">
<HI>more</HI> than indifferent to her: But as to LOVE, which I pre&s;&s;ed her to acknowlege, <HI>What need of acknowlege|ments of that &s;ort, when a woman con&s;ents to marry?</HI>&mdash;And once repul&s;ing me with di&s;plea&s;ure, <HI>The proof of the true love I was vowing for her, was</HI> re&s;pect, <HI>not</HI> freedom. And offering to defend my&s;elf, &s;he told me, that all the conception &s;he had been able to form of a faulty pa&s;&s;ion, was, that it mu&s;t demon&s;trate it&s;elf as mine &s;ought to do.</P>
<P>I endeavoured to ju&s;tify my pa&s;&s;ion, by laying over-delicacy at her door. That was <HI>not,</HI> &s;he &s;aid, <HI>my</HI> fault, if it were <HI>hers.</HI> She mu&s;t plainly tell me, that I appeared to her incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing what were the requi&s;ites of a pure mind. Perhaps, had the <HI>liber|tine</HI> pre&s;umption to imagine, that there was no differ|ence in <HI>heart,</HI> nor any but what proceeded from <HI>edu|cation</HI> and <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI> between the pure and the impure&mdash;And yet cu&s;tom <HI>alone,</HI> as &s;he ob&s;erved, would make a &s;econd nature, as well in good as in bad habits.</P>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t now been called to account for &s;ome innocent liberties which I thought my&s;elf intitled to take before the women; as they &s;uppo&s;e us married, and now within view of con&s;ummation.</P>
<P>I took the lecture very hardly; and with impati|ence wi&s;h'd for the happy day and hour, when I might call her all my own, and meet with no check from a nicene&s;s that had no example.</P>
<P>She looked at me with a ba&s;hful kind of contempt. I thought it <HI>contempt,</HI> and required the rea&s;on for it; not being con&s;cious of offence, as I told her.</P>
<P>This is not the fir&s;t time, Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid &s;he, that I have had cau&s;e to be di&s;plea&s;ed with you, when <HI>you,</HI> perhaps, have not thought your&s;elf exception|able.&mdash;But, Sir, let me tell you, that the married &s;tate, in my eye, is a &s;tate of purity, and (I think &s;he told me) not of <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; &s;o at lea&s;t, I under&s;tood her.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="261"><HI>Marriage-purity,</HI> Jack!&mdash;Very comical, 'faith&mdash;Yet, &s;weet dears, half the female world ready to run away with a rake, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he is a rake; and for no <HI>other</HI> rea&s;on; nay, every other rea&s;on <HI>again&s;t</HI> their choice.</P>
<P>But have not you and I, Belford, &s;een young wives, who would be thought mode&s;t; and when maids, were fanta&s;tically &s;hy; permit freedoms in public from their <HI>lambent</HI> hu&s;bands, which have &s;hewn, that they have forgot what belongs either to prudence or de|cency? While every mode&s;t eye has &s;unk under the &s;hamele&s;s effrontery, and every mode&s;t face been co|vered with blu&s;hes for tho&s;e who could not blu&s;h.</P>
<P>I once, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, propo&s;ed to a circle of a dozen, thus &s;candalized, to withdraw; &s;ince they mu&s;t needs &s;ee that as well the <HI>lady,</HI> as the gentleman, wanted to be in private. This motion had its effect upon the amorous pair; and I was applauded for the check given to their licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But, upon another occa&s;ion of this &s;ort, I acted a little more in character.&mdash;For I ventured to make an attempt upon a bride, which I &s;hould not have had the courage to make, had not the unblu&s;hing pa&s;&s;ive|ne&s;s with which &s;he received her fond hu&s;band's public toyings (looking round her with triumph rather than with &s;hame, upon every lady pre&s;ent), incited my curio&s;ity to know if the &s;ame complacency might not be &s;hewn to a private friend. 'Tis true, I was in ho|nour obliged to keep the &s;ecret. But I never &s;aw the turtles bill afterwards, but I thought of Number Two to the &s;ame female; and in my heart thanked the fond hu&s;band for the le&s;&s;on he had taught his wife.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid, thou wilt &s;ee, that I ap|prove of my beloved's exception to <HI>public</HI> loves. That, I hope, is all the charming I&s;icle means by <HI>marriage-purity.</HI></P>
<P>From the whole of the above, thou wilt gather, that I have not been a mere dangler, a Hickman, in
<PB N="255" REF="262">
the pa&s;&s;ed days, though not ab&s;olutely active, and a Lovelace.</P>
<P>The dear creature now con&s;iders her&s;elf as my wife-elect. The <HI>un&s;adden'd</HI> heart, no longer prudi&s;h, will not now, I hope, give the fable turn to every action of the man &s;he di&s;likes not. And yet &s;he mu&s;t keep up &s;o much re&s;erve, as will ju&s;tify pa&s;t inflexibilities. Many and many a pretty &s;oul would yield, were &s;he not afraid that the man &s;he favoured would think the wor&s;e of her for it. This is al&s;o a part of the Rake's Creed. But &s;hould &s;he re&s;ent ever &s;o &s;trongly, &s;he cannot now break with me; &s;ince, if &s;he does, there will be an end of the family reconciliation; and that in a way highly di&s;creditable to her&s;elf.</P>

<P>JUST returned from Doctors-Commons. I have been endeavouring to get a licence. Very true, Jack. I have the mortification to find a difficulty in obtain|ing this all-fettering in&s;trument, as the Lady is of rank and fortune, and as there is no con&s;ent of fa|ther or <HI>next friend.</HI></P>
<P>I made report of this difficulty. It is very right, &s;he &s;ays, that &s;uch difficulties &s;hould be made. But not to a man of my known fortune, &s;urely, Jack, tho' the woman were the daughter of a duke.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, If &s;he approved of the &s;ettlements? She &s;aid, She had compared them with my mother's, and had no objection.

<P>JUST now, in high good humour, my beloved re|turned me the draughts of the &s;ettlements; a copy of which I had &s;ent to Captain Tomlin&s;on. She com|plimented me, that &s;he never had any doubt of my

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, June</HI> 5.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am now almo&s;t in de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding with this charming fro&s;t-piece by love or gentlene&s;s.&mdash;A copy of the draughts, as I told thee, has been &s;ent to Captain Tomlin&s;on; and that by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger. Ingro&s;&s;ments are proceeding with. I have been again at the Commons. Should in all probability have pro|cured a licence by Malory's means, had not Malory's friend the proctor been &s;uddenly &s;ent for to Che&s;hunt, to make an old lady's will. Pritchard has told me by word of mouth, <HI>though my charmer &s;aw him not,</HI> all that was nece&s;&s;ary for her to know in the letter my Lord wrote, which I could not &s;hew her; and taken my directions about the e&s;tates to be made over to me on my nuptials.&mdash;Yet with all the&s;e favourable ap|pearances no conceding moment to be &s;ound, no im|proveable tenderne&s;s to be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Twice indeed with rapture, which once &s;he called rude, did I &s;alute her; and each time, re&s;enting the freedom, did &s;he retire; tho', to do her ju&s;tice, &s;he
<PB N="257" REF="264">
favoured me again with her pre&s;ence at my fir&s;t in|treaty, and took no notice of the cau&s;e of her with|drawing.</P>
<P>Is it policy to &s;hew &s;o open a re&s;entment for inno|cent liberties, which, in her &s;ituation, &s;he mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon forgive?</P>
<P><HI>Yet the woman who re&s;ents not initiatory freedoms mu&s;t be lo&s;t.</HI> For Love is an incroacher. Love never goes backward. Love is always a&s;piring. Always mu&s;t a&s;pire. Nothing but the highe&s;t act of Love can &s;atisfy an indulged Love. And what advantages has a lover, who values not breaking the peace, over his mi&s;tre&s;s, who is &s;olicitous to keep it!</P>
<P>I have now at this in&s;tant wrought my&s;elf up, for the dozenth time, to a half-re&s;olution. A thou&s;and agreeable things I have to &s;ay to her. She is in the dining-room. Ju&s;t gone up. She always expects me when there.</P>
<P>HIGH di&s;plea&s;ure!&mdash;followed by an abrupt de|parture.</P>
<P>I &s;at down by her. I took both her hands in mine. I would <HI>have</HI> it &s;o. All gentle my voice.&mdash;Her father mentioned with re&s;pect. Her mother with reverence. Even her brother amicably &s;poken of. I never thought I could have wi&s;hed &s;o ardently, as I told her I did wi&s;h, for a reconciliation with her family.</P>
<P>A &s;weet and grateful flu&s;h then over&s;pread her fair face; a gentle &s;igh now-and-then heaved her hand|kerchief.</P>
<P>I perfectly long'd to hear from Captain Tomlin&s;on. It was impo&s;&s;ible for her uncle to find fault with the draught of the &s;ettlements: I would not, however, be under&s;tood, by &s;ending them down, that I intended to put it in her uncle's power to delay my happy day. When, when, was it to be?</P>
<P>I would ha&s;ten again to the Commons; and would not return without the licence.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="265">The Lawn I propo&s;ed to retire to, as &s;oon as the happy ceremony was over. This day and that day I propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was time enough to name the day, when the &s;ettlements were completed, and the licence obtained. Happy &s;hould &s;he be, could the kind Captain Tom|lin&s;on obtain her uncle's pre&s;ence privately!</P>
<P>A good hint!&mdash;It may perhaps be improved upon&mdash;Either for a <HI>delay,</HI> or a <HI>pacifier.</HI></P>
<P>No new delays, for heaven's &s;ake, I be&s;ought her; reproaching her gently for the pa&s;t. Name but the day&mdash;(an early day, I hoped in the following week)&mdash;that I might hail its approach, and number the tardy hours.</P>
<P>My cheek reclined on her &s;houlder&mdash;ki&s;&s;ing her hands by turns. Rather ba&s;hfully than angrily re|luctant, her hands &s;ought to be withdrawn; her &s;houl|der avoiding my reclined cheek&mdash;Apparently loth and more loth to quarrel with me; her downca&s;t eye confe&s;&s;ing more than her lips could utter.&mdash;Now &s;urely, thought I, it is my time to try if &s;he can for|give a &s;till bolder freedom than I had ever yet taken.</P>
<P>I then gave her &s;truggling hands liberty. I put one arm round her wai&s;t: I imprinted a ki&s;s on her &s;weet lips, with a <HI>Be quiet</HI> only, and an averted face, as if &s;he feared another.</P>
<P>Encouraged by &s;o gentle a repul&s;e, the tendere&s;t things I &s;aid; and then, with my other hand, drew a&s;ide the handkerchief that concealed the beauty of beauties, and pre&s;&s;ed with my burning lips the charminge&s;t brea&s;t that ever my ravi&s;hed eyes beheld.</P>
<P>A very contrary pa&s;&s;ion to that which gave her bo|&s;om &s;o delightful a &s;well, immediately took place. She &s;truggled out of my incircling arms with in|dignation. I detained her reluctant hand. Let me go, &s;aid &s;he. I &s;ee there is no keeping terms with you. Ba&s;e incroacher! Is this the de&s;ign of your flat|tering &s;peeches?&mdash;Far as matters have gone, I will
<PB N="259" REF="266">
for ever renounce you. You have an odious heart. Let me go, I tell you.&mdash;</P>
<P>I was forced to obey, and &s;he flung from me, re|peating <HI>ba&s;e,</HI> and adding <HI>flattering,</HI> incroacher.</P>
<P>IN vain have I urged by Dorcas for the promi&s;ed favour of dining with her. She would not dine <HI>at all.</HI> She <HI>could not.</HI></P>
<P>But why makes &s;he every inch of her per&s;on thus &s;acred?&mdash;So near the time too, that &s;he mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that all will be my own, by deed of purcha&s;e and &s;ettlement?</P>
<P>She has read, no doubt, of the art of the Ea&s;tern monarchs, who &s;eque&s;ter them&s;elves from the eyes of their &s;ubjects, in order to excite their adoration, when, upon &s;ome &s;olemn occa&s;ions, they think fit to appear in public.</P>
<P>But let me a&s;k thee, Belford, whether (on the&s;e &s;o|lemn occa&s;ions) the preceding cavalcade; here a great officer, and there a great mini&s;ter, with their &s;atellites, and glaring equipages; do not prepare the eyes of the wondering beholders, by degrees, to bear the blaze of canopy'd maje&s;ty (what tho' but an ugly old man per|haps him&s;elf? yet) glittering in the collected riches of his va&s;t empire?</P>
<P>And &s;hould not my beloved, for her own &s;ake, de|&s;cend, by <HI>degrees,</HI> from <HI>godde&s;s-hood</HI> into <HI>humanity?</HI> If it be <HI>pride</HI> that re&s;trains her, ought not that pride to be puni&s;hed? If, as in the Ea&s;tern emperors, it be <HI>art</HI> as well as <HI>pride, art</HI> is what &s;he of all women need not u&s;e. If <HI>&s;hame,</HI> what a &s;hame to be a&s;hamed to communicate to her adorer's &s;ight the mo&s;t admirable of her per&s;onal graces?</P>
<P>Let me peri&s;h, Belford, if I would not forego the brighte&s;t diadem in the world, for the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing a Twin-Lovelace at each charming brea&s;t, drawing from it his fir&s;t &s;u&s;tenance; the pious ta&s;k continued for one month, and no more!</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="267">I now, methinks, behold this mo&s;t charming of women in this &s;weet office, pre&s;&s;ing with her fine fingers the generous flood into the purple mouths of each eager hunter by turns: Her con&s;cious eye now dropt on one, now on the other, with a &s;igh of ma|ternal tenderne&s;s; and then rai&s;ed up to my delighted eye, full of wi&s;hes, for the &s;ake of the pretty varlets, and for her own &s;ake, that I would deign to legiti|mate; that I would conde&s;cend to put on the nuptial fetters.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, P. M.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A Letter received from the worthy Captain Tom|lin&s;on, has introduced me into the pre&s;ence of my charmer, &s;ooner than perhaps I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been admitted.</P>
<P>Sullen her brow, at her fir&s;t entrance into the dine|ing-room. But I took no notice of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and her anger &s;lid away upon its own ice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Captain, after letting me know, that he cho&s;e not to write, till he had the promi&s;ed draught of the &s;ettlements, acquaints me, that his friend Mr. John Harlowe, in their fir&s;t conference (which was held as &s;oon as he got down), was extremely &s;urprized, and even grieved (as he feared he would be) to hear, that we were not married. The world, he &s;aid, who knew my character, would be very c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|&s;orious, were it owned, that we had lived &s;o long together unmarried in the &s;ame lodgings; altho' our marriage were now to be ever &s;o publicly cele|brated.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'His nephew James, he was &s;ure, would make a great handle of it again&s;t any motion that might be made towards a reconciliation; and with the greater
<PB N="261" REF="268">
&s;ucce&s;s, as there was not a family in the kingdom more jealous of their honour than theirs.'</Q></P>
<P>This is true of the Harlowes, Jack: They have been called <HI>The proud Harlowes:</HI> And I have ever found, that all young Honour is &s;upercilious and touchy.</P>
<P>But &s;ee&s;t thou not how right I was in my endeavour to per&s;uade my fair one to allow her uncle's friend to think us married; e&s;pecially as he came <HI>prepared</HI> to believe it; and as her uncle <HI>hoped</HI> it was &s;o?&mdash;But nothing on earth is &s;o perver&s;e, as a woman when &s;he is &s;et upon carrying a point, and has a <HI>meek</HI> man, or one who loves his <HI>peace,</HI> to deal with.</P>
<P>My Beloved was vexed. She pulled out her hand|kerchief: But was more inclined to blame me, than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Had you kept your word, Mr. Lovelace, and left me when we came to town&mdash;And there &s;he &s;topt; for &s;he knew, that it was her own fault that we were not marry'd before we left the country; and how could I leave her afterwards, while her brother was plotting to carry her off by violence?</P>
<P>Nor has he yet given over his machinations.</P>
<P>For, as the Captain proceeds,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Mr. John Harlowe owned to him (but in confidence), that his nephew is at this time bu&s;ied in endeavouring to find out where we are; being a&s;&s;ured, as I am not to be heard of at any of my relations, or at my u&s;ual lodgings, that we are together. And that we are not mar|ried, is plain, as he will have it, from Mr. Hick|man's application &s;o lately made to her uncle; and which was &s;econded by Mrs. Norton to her mother. And he cannot bear, that I &s;hould enjoy &s;uch a triumph unmole&s;ted.'</Q></P>
<P>A profound &s;igh, and the handkerchief again lifted to the eye. But did not the &s;weet &s;oul de&s;erve this turn upon her, for her felonious intention to rob me of her&s;elf?</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="269">I read on to the following effect:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Why (Mr. Harlowe a&s;ked) was it &s;aid to his other inquiring friend, that we <HI>were</HI> married; and that by his niece's woman, who ought to know? Who could give <HI>convincing</HI> rea&s;ons, no doubt'</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Here again &s;he wept, took a turn cro&s;s the room; then returned&mdash;Read on, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;</P>
<P>Will you, my deare&s;t life, read it your&s;elf?</P>
<P>I will take the letter with me, by-and-by&mdash;I cannot <HI>&s;ee</HI> to read it ju&s;t now, wiping her eyes.&mdash;Read on&mdash;Let me hear it all&mdash;that I may know your &s;entiments upon this letter, as well as give my own.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Captain then told uncle John, the rea&s;ons that induced me to give out that we were married; and the conditions on which my Beloved was brought to countenance it; which had kept us at the mo&s;t punctilious di&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But &s;till my character was in&s;i&s;ted upon. And Mr. Harlowe went away di&s;&s;atisfied. And the Cap|tain was al&s;o &s;o much concerned, that he cared not to write what the re&s;ult of this fir&s;t conference was.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But in the next, which was held on receipt of the draughts, at his the Captain's hou&s;e (as the former was, for the greater &s;ecrecy), when the old gentle|man had read them, and had the Captain's opinion, he was much better plea&s;ed. And yet he declared, that it would not be ea&s;y to per&s;uade any other per|&s;on of his family to believe &s;o favourably of the mat|ter, as he was <HI>now</HI> willing to believe, were they to know, that we had lived &s;o long together unmar|ried.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'And then the Captain &s;ays, his dear friend made a propo&s;al:&mdash;It was this&mdash;<HI>That we &s;hould marry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of hand, but as privately as po&s;&s;ible, as indeed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> found we intended</HI> (for he could have no objection to the draughts)&mdash;<HI>But yet, he expected to have pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;ent one tru&s;ty friend of his own, for his better &s;ati&s;|faction</HI>&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="270">Here I &s;topt, with a de&s;ign to be angry&mdash;But &s;he de&s;iring me to read on, I obeyed.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'&mdash;But <HI>that it &s;hould pa&s;s to every one living, ex|cept to that tru&s;ty per&s;on, to him&s;elf, and to the Cap|tain, that we were married from the time that we had lived together in one hou&s;e; and that this time &s;hould be made to agree with that of Mr. Hickman's appli|cation to him from Mi&s;s Howe.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>This, my deare&s;t life, &s;aid I, is a very con&s;iderate propo&s;al. We have nothing to do, but to caution the people below properly on this head. I did not think your uncle Harlowe capable of &s;uch an expe|dient. But you &s;ee how much his heart is in the re|conciliation.</P>
<P>This was the return I met with&mdash;You have always, as a mark of your politene&s;s, let me know, how <HI>meanly</HI> you think of every one of my family.</P>
<P>Yet, thou wilt think, Belford, that I could forgive her for the reproach.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Captain does not know, he &s;ays, how this propo&s;al will be reli&s;hed by us. But, for his part, he thinks it an expedient that will obviate many difficulties, and may po&s;&s;ibly put an end to Mr. James Harlowe's further de&s;igns: And on this ac|count he has, by the uncle's advice, already de|clared to two &s;everal per&s;ons, by who&s;e means it may come to that young gentleman's ears, that he (Captain Tomlin&s;on) has very great rea&s;on to be|lieve, that we were married &s;oon after Mr. Hick|man's application was rejected.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'And this, Mr. Lovelace (&s;ays the Captain), will enable you to pay a compliment to the family, that will not be un&s;uitable to the genero&s;ity of &s;ome of the declarations you was plea&s;ed to make to the Lady before me (and which Mr. John Harlowe may make &s;ome advantage of in favour of a reconcilia|tion); in that you have not demanded your lady's e&s;tate &s;o &s;oon as you were intitled to make the de|mand.'</Q>
<PB N="264" REF="271">
An excellent contriver &s;urely &s;he mu&s;t think this worthy Mr. Tomlin&s;on to be!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But the Captain adds, that if either the Lady or I di&s;approve of his report of our marriage, he will retract it. Neverthele&s;s he mu&s;t tell me, that Mr. John Harlowe is very much &s;et upon this way of proceeding; as the only one, in his opinion, ca|pable of being improved into a general reconcilia|tion. But if we do acquie&s;ce in it, he be&s;eeches my fair one not to &s;u&s;pend my day, that he may be authorized in what he &s;ays, as to the truth of the main fact [How con&s;cientious this good man!]: Nor mu&s;t it be expected, he &s;ays, that her uncle will take one &s;tep towards the wi&s;hed-for recon|ciliation, till the <HI>&s;olemnity is actually over.</HI></Q></P>
<P>He adds,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that he &s;hall be very &s;oon in town on other affairs; and then propo&s;es to attend us, and give us a more particular account of all that pa&s;&s;ed, or &s;hall further pa&s;s, between Mr. Harlowe and him.'</Q></P>
<P>Well, my deare&s;t life, what &s;ay you to your uncle's expedient? Shall I write to the Captain, and ac|quaint him, that we have no objection to it?</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent for a few minutes. At la&s;t, with a &s;igh&mdash;See, Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid &s;he, what you have brought me to, by treading after you in &s;uch crooked paths!&mdash;See what di&s;grace I have incurred!&mdash;Indeed you have not acted like a wi&s;e man.</P>
<P>My beloved creature, do you not remember, how earne&s;tly I be&s;ought the honour of your hand before we came to town?&mdash;Had I been <HI>then</HI> favoured&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, well, Sir&mdash;There has been much ami&s;s &s;omewhere; that's all I will &s;ay at pre&s;ent. And &s;ince what's pa&s;t cannot be recalled, my uncle mu&s;t be obeyed, I think.</P>
<P>Charmingly dutiful!&mdash;I had nothing then to do, that I might not be behindhand with the worthy Cap|tain and her uncle, but to pre&s;s for the day. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="265" REF="272">
fervently did. But (as I might have expected) her former an&s;wer was repeated, That when the &s;ettle|ments were completed; when the licence was actually obtained; it would be time enough to name the day: And, O Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid &s;he, turning from me with a grace inimitably tender, her handkerchief at her eyes, what a happine&s;s, if my dear uncle could be prevailed upon to be per&s;onally a father, on this occa&s;ion, to <HI>the poor fatherle&s;s girl!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>What's the matter with me!&mdash;Whence this dew|drop!&mdash;A tear!&mdash;As I hope to be &s;aved, it is a tear, Jack!&mdash;Very ready methinks!&mdash;Only on reciting!&mdash;But her lively image was before me, in the very atti|tude &s;he &s;poke the words&mdash;And indeed at the <HI>time</HI> &s;he &s;poke them, the&s;e lines of Shake&s;peare came into my head.</P>
<Q><L>Thy heart is big. Get thee apart, and weep!</L>
<L>Pa&s;&s;ion, I &s;ee, is catching:&mdash;For my eyes,</L>
<L>Seeing tho&s;e beads of &s;orrow &s;tand in thine,</L>
<L>Begin to water&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>I withdrew, and wrote to the Captain to the fol|lowing effect&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That he would be &s;o good as to ac|quaint his dear friend, that we intirely acquie&s;ced with what he had propo&s;ed; and had already <HI>pro|perly</HI> cautioned the gentlewomen of the hou&s;e, and their &s;ervants, as well as our own: That if he would in per&s;on give me the ble&s;&s;ing of his dear niece's hand, it would crown the wi&s;hes of both: That his own day, in this ca&s;e, as I pre&s;umed it would be a &s;hort one, &s;hould be ours: That by this means the &s;ecret would be in fewer hands: That I my&s;elf thought the ceremony could not be too privately performed; and this not only for the &s;ake of the wi&s;e end he had intended to be an&s;wered by it, but becau&s;e I would not have Lord M. think him&s;elf &s;lighted; as he had once intended (as I had told him) to be our nup|tial father, had we not declined his offer, in order
<PB N="266" REF="273">
to avoid a public wedding; which his beloved niece would not come into, while &s;he was in di&s;grace with her friends.&mdash;But that, if he cho&s;e not to do us this honour, I wi&s;hed that Captain Tomlin&s;on might be the tru&s;ty per&s;on, whom he would have to be pre|&s;ent on the happy occa&s;ion.'</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hewed this letter to my fair one. She was not di&s;plea&s;ed with it. So, Jack, we cannot now move too fa&s;t, as to Settlements and Licen&s;e: The day is her <HI>Uncle's day,</HI> or <HI>Captain Tomlin&s;on's</HI> perhaps, as &s;hall be&s;t &s;uit the occa&s;ion. Mi&s;s Howe's Smug|gling &s;cheme is now &s;urely provided again&s;t in all events.</P>
<P>But I will not by anticipation make thee a judge of all the benefits that may flow from this my elaborate contrivance. Why will the&s;e girls put me upon my <HI>ma&s;ter-&s;trokes?</HI></P>
<P>And now for a little mine which I am getting ready to &s;pring. The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and at the rate I go on [now a <HI>re&s;olution,</HI> and now a <HI>remor&s;e</HI>], perhaps the <HI>la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>little</HI> mine, I call it. But it may be attended with great effects. I &s;hall not, however, ab&s;olutely depend upon the &s;ucce&s;s of it, having much more effectual ones in re&s;erve. And yet great engines are often moved by little &s;prings. A &s;mall &s;park fal|ling by accident into a powder-magazine, has &s;ome|times done more execution, than an hundred cannon</P>
<P>Come, the wor&s;t to the wor&s;t, the <HI>hymeneal torch,</HI> and a <HI>white &s;heet,</HI> mu&s;t be my <HI>amende honorable,</HI> as the French have it.</P>

<P>UNSUCCESSFUL as hitherto my application to thee has been, I cannot for the heart of me for|bear writing once more in behalf of this admirable

woman: And yet am unable to account for the zeal which impels me to take her part with an earne&s;tne&s;s &s;o &s;incere.</P>
<P>But all her merit thou acknowlege&s;t; all thy own vilene&s;s thou confe&s;&s;e&s;t, and even glorie&s;t in it; what hope then of moving &s;o harden'd a man?&mdash;Yet, as it is not too late, and thou art neverthele&s;s upon the cri&s;is, I am re&s;olved to try what another letter will do. It is but my writing in vain, if it do no good; and if thou wilt let me prevail, I know thou wilt hereafter think me richly intitled to thy thanks.</P>
<P>To <HI>argue</HI> with thee would be folly. The ca&s;e can|not require it. I will only <HI>intreat</HI> thee, therefore, that thou wilt not let &s;uch an excellence lo&s;e the re|ward of her vigilant virtue.</P>
<P>I believe, there never were libertines &s;o vile, but purpo&s;ed, at &s;ome future period of their lives, to &s;et about reforming; and let me beg of thee, that thou wilt, in this great article, make thy future repentance as ea&s;y, as &s;ome time hence thou wilt wi&s;h thou <HI>had&s;t</HI> made it. If thou proceede&s;t, I have no doubt, that this affair will end tragically, one way or other. It mu&s;t. Such a woman mu&s;t intere&s;t both gods and men in her cau&s;e. But what I mo&s;t apprehend, is, that with her own hand, in re&s;entment of the perpe|trated outrage, &s;he (like another Lucretia) will a&s;&s;ert the purity of her heart: Or, if her piety pre&s;erve her from this violence, that wa&s;ting grief will &s;oon put a period to her days. And in either ca&s;e, will not the remembrance of thy <HI>ever-during</HI> guilt, and <HI>tran&s;itory</HI> triumph, be a torment of torments to thee?</P>
<P>'Tis a &s;eriou&s;ly &s;ad thing, after all, that &s;o fine a creature &s;hould have fallen into &s;uch vile and remor&s;e|le&s;s hands: For, from thy cradle, as I have heard thee own, thou ever delighted&s;t to &s;port with and torment the animal, whether bird or bea&s;t, that thou loved&s;t, and had&s;t a power over.</P>
<P>How different is the ca&s;e of this fine woman from
<PB N="268" REF="275">
that of any other whom thou ha&s;t &s;educed! I need not mention to thee, nor in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;triking differ|ence: Ju&s;tice, gratitude, thy intere&s;t, thy vows, all engaging thee; and thou certainly loving her, as far as thou art capable of love, above all her &s;ex. She not to be drawn a&s;ide by art, or to be made to &s;uffer from credulity, nor for want of wit and di&s;cernment (that will be another cutting reflection to &s;o fine a mind as hers): The contention between you only unequal, as it is between naked innocence and armed guilt. In every thing el&s;e, as thou owne&s;t, her talents greatly &s;uperior to thine!&mdash;What a fate will hers be, if thou art not at la&s;t overcome by thy reiterated remor&s;es!</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, indeed, when I was admitted into her pre&s;ence <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol <HI>III.</HI> p. <HI>32<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI></NOTE>, and (till I ob&s;erved her meaning air, and heard her &s;peak), I &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he had no very uncommon <HI>judgment</HI> to boa&s;t of: For I made, as I thought, but <HI>ju&s;t</HI> allowances for her blo&s;&s;oming youth, and for that loveline&s;s of per&s;on, and ea&s;ine&s;s of dre&s;s, which I imagined mu&s;t have taken up half her time and &s;tudy to cultivate; and yet I had been prepared by thee to entertain a very high opinion of her &s;en&s;e and her reading. Her choice of this gay fellow, upon &s;uch hazardous terms (thought I), is a confirmation that her <HI>wit</HI> wants that maturity which only <HI>years</HI> and <HI>experience</HI> can give it. Her <HI>knowlege</HI> (argued I to my|&s;elf) mu&s;t be all <HI>theory</HI>; and the complai&s;ance ever con&s;orting with an age &s;o green and &s;o gay, will make &s;o inexperienced a lady at lea&s;t forbear to &s;hew her|&s;elf <HI>di&s;gu&s;ted</HI> at freedoms of di&s;cour&s;e, in which tho&s;e pre&s;ent of her own &s;ex, and &s;ome of ours (&s;o learned, &s;o well read, and &s;o travelled), allow them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In this pre&s;umption, I run on; and, having the advantage, as I conceited, of all the company but thee, and being de&s;irous to appear in her eyes a mighty clever fellow, I thought I <HI>&s;hewed away,</HI> when I &s;aid any fooli&s;h things that had more &s;ound than &s;en&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

them; and when I made &s;illy je&s;ts, which attracted the &s;miles of thy Sinclair, and the &s;pecious Partington; and that Mi&s;s Harlowe did not &s;mile too, I thought was owing to her youth or affectation, or to a mixture of both, perhaps to a greater command of her fea|tures.&mdash;Little dreamt I, that I was incurring her con|tempt all the time.</P>
<P>But when, as I &s;aid, I heard her &s;peak; which &s;he did not till &s;he had fathomed us all; when I heard her &s;entiments on two or three &s;ubjects, and took no|tice of that &s;earching eye, darting into the very inmo&s;t cells of our frothy brains, by my faith, it made me look about me; and I began to recollect, and be a&s;hamed of all I had &s;aid before; in &s;hort, was re|&s;olved to &s;it &s;ilent, till every one had talk'd round, to keep my folly in countenance. And then I rai&s;ed the &s;ubjects that &s;he <HI>could</HI> join in, and which &s;he <HI>did</HI> join in, &s;o much to the confu&s;ion and &s;urprize of every|one of us!&mdash;For even thou, Lovelace, &s;o noted for &s;mart wit, repartee, and a vein of raillery, that de|lighteth all who come near thee, &s;atte&s;t in palpable darkne&s;s, and looked&s;t about thee, as well as we.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance only, of this, &s;hall I remind thee of?</P>
<P>We talked of <HI>wit,</HI> and of <HI>wit,</HI> and aimed at it, bandying it like a ball from one to another of us, and re&s;ting it chiefly with thee, who wert always proud enough and vain enough of the attribute; and then more e&s;pecially, as thou had&s;t a&s;&s;embled us, as far as I know, principally to &s;hew the lady thy &s;uperiority over us; and us thy triumph over her. And then Tour|ville (who is always &s;atisfied with wit at &s;econd-hand; wit upon memory; other mens with), repeated &s;ome ver&s;es, as applicable to the &s;ubject; which two of us applauded, tho' full of double entendre. Thou, &s;ee|ing the lady's &s;erious air on one of tho&s;e repetitions, applied&s;t thy&s;elf to her, de&s;iring her notions of wit: A quality, thou &s;aid&s;t, which every one prized, whe|ther flowing from him&s;elf, or found in another.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="277">Then it was &s;he took all our attention:&mdash;It was a quality much talked of, &s;he &s;aid, but, &s;he believed, very little under&s;tood:&mdash;At lea&s;t, if &s;he might be &s;o free as to give her judgment of it, from what had pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ent conver&s;ation, &s;he mu&s;t &s;ay, that Wit with Gentlemen was one thing; with Ladies, another.</P>
<P>This &s;tartled us all:&mdash;How the women looked!&mdash;How they pur&s;ed in their mouths, a broad &s;mile the moment before upon each, from the ver&s;es they had heard repeated, &s;o well under&s;tood, as we &s;aw, by their looks&mdash;While I be&s;ought her to let us know, for our in&s;truction, what Wit was with <HI>Ladies:</HI> For &s;uch I was &s;ure it <HI>ought</HI> to be, with <HI>Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>Cowley, &s;he &s;aid, had defined it prettily by ne|gatives.</P>
<P>Thou de&s;ired&s;t her to repeat his definition.</P>
<P>She did; and with &s;o much graceful ea&s;e, and beau|ty, and propriety of accent, as would have made bad poetry delightful.</P>

<P>Here &s;he &s;topt, looking round her upon us all with con&s;cious &s;uperiority, as I thought. Lord! how we &s;tar'd! Thou attempted&s;t to give us thy definition of wit, that thou mighte&s;t have &s;omething to &s;ay, and not &s;eem to be &s;urpri&s;ed into &s;ilent mode&s;ty.</P>

<P>If thou recollecte&s;t this part of the conver&s;ation, and how like fools we looked at one another: How much it put us out of conceit with our&s;elves, and made us <HI>fear</HI> her; when we found our conver&s;ation thus ex|cluded from the very character which our vanity had made us think unque&s;tionably ours: And if thou pro|fite&s;t properly by the recollection, thou wilt be of my mind, that there is not &s;o much wit in wickedne&s;s, as we had flattered our&s;elves there was.</P>
<P>And after all, I have been of opinion ever &s;ince <HI>that</HI> conver&s;ation, that the wit of all the rakes and libertines I ever convers'd with, from the brilliant Bob Lovelace down to little Johnny Hartop the pun&s;ter, con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly in &s;aying bold and &s;hocking things, with &s;uch courage, as &s;hall make Mode&s;t people blu&s;h, the Impudent laugh, and the Ignorant &s;tare.</P>
<P>And why do&s;t thou think I mention the&s;e things, &s;o mal-&agrave;-propos, as it may &s;eem?&mdash;Only, let me tell thee, as an in&s;tance, among many that might be given from the &s;ame evening's conver&s;ation, of this fine l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy's &s;uperiority in tho&s;e talents which ennoble na|ture, and dignify her &s;ex: Evidenced not only to each of us, as we offended, but to the flippant Partington, and the gro&s;&s;er, but egregiou&s;ly hypocritical Sinclair, in the correcting eye, the di&s;couraging blu&s;h, in which was mixed as much di&s;plea&s;ure as mode&s;ty, and &s;ome|times, as the occa&s;ion called for it (for we were &s;ome of us hardened above the &s;en&s;e of feeling <HI>delicate</HI> re|proof),

by the &s;overeign contempt, mingled with a di&s;dainful kind of pity, that &s;hewed, at once, her own con&s;cious worthy, and our de&s;picable worthle&s;|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>O Lovelace! what then was the triumph, even in my eye, and what is it &s;till upon reflection, of <HI>true</HI> mode&s;ty, of <HI>true</HI> wit, and <HI>true</HI> politene&s;s, over frothy je&s;t, laughing impertinence, and an ob&s;cenity &s;o &s;hame|ful, even to the guilty, that they cannot hint at it but under a double meaning!</P>
<P>Then, as thou ha&s;t &s;omewhere ob&s;erved, all her correctives <HI>avowed</HI> by her eye. Not poorly, like the generality of her &s;ex, affecting ignorance of meanings too obvious to be concealed; but &s;o re&s;enting, as to &s;hew each impudent laugher, the offence given to, and taken by, a purity, that had mi&s;taken its way, when it fell into &s;uch company.</P>
<P>Such is the woman, &s;uch is the angel, whom thou ha&s;t betrayed into thy power, and would&s;t deceive and ruin.&mdash;Sweet creature! did &s;he but know, how &s;he is &s;urrounded (as I then thought as well as now think), and what is <HI>intended,</HI> how much &s;ooner would death be her choice, than &s;o dreadful a &s;ituation!&mdash;And how effectually would her &s;tory, were it generally known, warn all the Sex again&s;t throwing them&s;elves into the power of ours, let our vows, oaths, and prote&s;tations, be what they will!</P>
<P>But let me beg of thee, once more, my dear Love|lace, if thou ha&s;t any regard for thy honour, for the honour of thy family, for thy future peace, or for my opinion of thee (who yet pretend not to be &s;o much moved by principle, as by that dazling merit, which ought &s;till more to attract <HI>thee</HI>), to be prevailed upon&mdash;to be&mdash;to be <HI>humane,</HI> that's all&mdash;Only, that thou woulde&s;t not di&s;grace our common humanity!</P>
<P>Hardened as thou art, I know, that they are the abandoned people in the hou&s;e who keep thee up to a re&s;olution again&s;t her. O that the &s;agacious fair one,

with &s;o much innocent charity in her own heart, had not &s;o re&s;olutely held tho&s;e women at di&s;tance!&mdash;That, as &s;he boarded there, &s;he had oftener tabled with them.

And yet, perhaps, with &s;o determined an enterprizer, this di&s;covery might have accelerated her ruin.</P>
<P>I know that thou art nice in thy loves. But are there not hundreds of women, who, tho' not utterly abandoned, would be taken with thee for mere <HI>per|&s;onal</HI> regards? Make a toy, if thou wilt, of principle, with regard to &s;uch of the Sex as regard it as a toy; but rob not an angel of tho&s;e purities, which, in her own opinion, con&s;titute the difference between ange|lic and brutal qualities.</P>
<P>With regard to the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, the le&s;s of &s;oul in either man or woman, the more &s;en&s;ual are they. Thou, Lovelace, ha&s;t a &s;oul, tho' a corrupted one; and art more intent (as thou even glorie&s;t) upon the preparative &s;tratagem, than upon the end of conquer|ing.</P>

<P>But in thy opinion, I &s;uffer for that &s;implicity in my contrivances, which is their principal excellence. No machinery make I nece&s;&s;ary. No unnatural flights aim I at. All pure nature, taking advantage of na|ture, as nature tends; and &s;o &s;imple my devices, that when they are known, thou, even thou, imagine&s;t, thou coulde&s;t have thought of the &s;ame. And indeed thou &s;eeme&s;t to <HI>own,</HI> that the &s;light thou putte&s;t upon them, is owing to my letting thee into them before|hand; undi&s;tingui&s;hing, as well as ingrateful as thou art!</P>
<P>Yet, after all, I would not have thee think, that I do not know my weak places. I have formerly told thee, that it is difficult for the able&s;t general to &s;ay what he <HI>will</HI> do, or what he <HI>can</HI> do, when he is obliged to regulate his motions by tho&s;e of a watch|ful enemy <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> III. <HI>p.</HI> 192.</NOTE>. If thou give&s;t due weight to this con|&s;ideration, thou wilt not wonder that I &s;hould make many marches and countermarches, &s;ome of which may appear to a &s;light ob&s;erver unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But let me cur&s;orily enter into this debate with thee on this &s;ubject, now I am within &s;ight of my journey's end.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="286">Abundance of impertinent things thou telle&s;t me in this letter; &s;ome of which thou had&s;t from my&s;elf; others that I knew before.</P>
<P>All that thou &s;aye&s;t in this charming creature's prai&s;e, is &s;hort of what I have &s;aid and written, on this inexhau&s;tible &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Her virtue, her re&s;i&s;tance, which are her merits, are my <HI>&s;timulatives.</HI> Have I not told thee &s;o twenty times over?</P>
<P><HI>Devil,</HI> as the&s;e girls between them call me, what of devil am I, but in my <HI>contrivances?</HI> I am not more a devil, than others, in the <HI>end</HI> I aim at; for when I have carried my point, it is &s;till but <HI>one</HI> &s;eduction. And I have perhaps been &s;pared the guilt of many &s;e|ductions, in the time.</P>
<P>What of uncommon would there be in this ca&s;e, but for her watchfulne&s;s?&mdash;As well as I love intrigue and &s;tratagem, do&s;t think, that I had not rather have gained my end with le&s;s trouble and le&s;s guilt?</P>
<P>The man, let me tell thee, who is as wicked as he <HI>can</HI> be, is a wor&s;e man than I am. Let me a&s;k any Rake in England, if, re&s;olving to carry his point, he would have been &s;o long about it? or have had &s;o much compunction as I have had?</P>
<P>Were every Rake, nay, were every Man, to &s;it down, as I do, and write all that enters into his head or into his heart, and to accu&s;e him&s;elf with equal freedom and truth, what an army of mi&s;creants &s;hould I have to keep me in countenance!</P>
<P>It is a maxim with &s;ome, that if they are left alone with a woman, and make not an attempt upon her, &s;he will think her&s;elf affronted.&mdash;Are not &s;uch men as the&s;e wor&s;e than I am?&mdash;What an opinion mu&s;t they have of the whole Sex?</P>
<P>Let me defend the Sex I &s;o dearly love.&mdash;If the&s;e elder brethren of ours, thir&s;k they have general rea&s;on for their a&s;&s;ertion, they mu&s;t have kept very bad company, or mu&s;t judge of womens hearts by their

own. She mu&s;t be an abandoned woman, who will not &s;hrink as a &s;nail into its &s;hell, at a gro&s;s and &s;ud|den attempt. A mode&s;t woman mu&s;t be naturally cold, re&s;erved, and &s;hy. She cannot be &s;o much, and &s;o &s;oon affected, as libertines are apt to imagine; and mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, have &s;ome confidence in the ho|nour and &s;ilence of a man, before de&s;ire can po&s;&s;ibly put forth in her, to encourage and meet his flame. For my own part, I have been always decent in the company of women, till I was &s;ure of them. Nor have I ever offered a <HI>great</HI> offence, till I have found <HI>little</HI> ones pa&s;&s;ed over; and that they &s;hunn'd me not, when they knew my character.</P>
<P>My divine Clari&s;&s;a has puzzled me, and beat me out of my play: At one time, I hoped to overcome by <HI>intimidating</HI> her, at another by <HI>Love</HI>; by the amorous <HI>See-&s;aw,</HI> as I have called it <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> III. <HI>p.</HI> 99.</NOTE>.

<P>And who&s;e property, I pray thee, &s;hall I invade, if I pur&s;ue my &s;chemes of love and vengeance?&mdash;Have not tho&s;e who have a right in her, renounced that right?&mdash;Have they not wilfully expo&s;ed her to dangers?&mdash;Yet mu&s;t know, that &s;uch a woman would be con&s;idered as lawful prize, by as many as could have the opportunity to attempt her?&mdash;And had they not thus cruelly expo&s;ed her, is &s;he not a <HI>&s;ingle woman?</HI>&mdash;And need I tell thee, Jack, that men of our ca&s;t, the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of them [the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> &s;tick at no|thing] think it a great grace and favour done to the married men, if they leave them their wives to them|&s;elves; and compound for their &s;i&s;ters, daughters, wards, and nieces?&mdash;Shocking as the&s;e principles mu&s;t be to a reflecting mind; yet &s;uch thou knowe&s;t are the principles of thou&s;ands (who would not act by the Sex as I have acted by them, when in my power); and as often carried into practice, as their opportuni|ties

or courage will permit.&mdash;Such therefore have no right to blame me.</P>
<P>Thou repeatedly pleade&s;t her &s;ufferings from her family. But I have too often an&s;wered this plea, to need to &s;ay any more now, than that &s;he has not &s;uf|fered for <HI>my &s;ake.</HI> For has &s;he not been made the victim of the malice of her rapacious brother and en|vious &s;i&s;ter, who only waited for an occa&s;ion to ruin her with her other relations; and took this as the fir&s;t, to drive her out of the hou&s;e; and, as it happen'd, into my arms?&mdash;Thou knowe&s;t how much <HI>again&s;t her inclination.</HI></P>
<P>As for her <HI>own</HI> &s;ins, how many has the dear crea|ture to an&s;wer for to <HI>Love</HI> and to <HI>me!</HI>&mdash;Twenty, and twenty times twenty, has &s;he not told me, that &s;he refu&s;ed not the odious Solmes in favour to me? And as often has &s;he not offered to renounce me for the &s;ingle life, if the Implacables would have received her on that condition?&mdash;What repetitions does thy weak pity make me guilty of?</P>
<P>To look a little farther back: Can&s;t thou forget what my &s;ufferings were from this haughty beauty, in the whole time of my attendance upon her proud mo|tions, in the purlieus of Harlowe-Place, and at the little White Hart at Neale, as we called it?&mdash;Did I not threaten vengeance upon her then (and had I not rea&s;on?) for di&s;appointing me [I will give but this one in&s;tance] of a promi&s;ed interview?</P>

<P>I told thee, at my melancholy return, what were the contents of the letter I wrote <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 118.</NOTE>. And I &s;hewed thee afterwards, her tyrannical an&s;wer to it <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> III. <HI>p.</HI> 120.</NOTE>. Thou then, Jack, loved&s;t thy friend; and pitied&s;t thy poor &s;uffering Lovelace. Even the affronted God of Love approved then of my threatened vengeance again&s;t the fair promi&s;er; tho' now with thee, in the day of my power, forgetful of the night of my &s;ufferings, he is become an advocate for her.</P>
<P>Nay, was it not he him&s;elf that brought to me my adorable <HI>Neme&s;is</HI>; and both together put me upon this very vow,

<P>FAITH, Jack, thou had&s;t half undone me with thy non&s;en&s;e, tho' I would not own it in my ye&s;terday's letter; my con&s;cience of thy party before. But I think I am my own man again.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="295">So near to execution my plot! So near &s;pringing my mine! All agreed upon between the women and me, or I believe thou had&s;t overthrown me.</P>
<P>I have time for a few lines preparative to what is to happen in an hour or two; and I love to write to the moment.&mdash;</P>
<P>We have been extremely happy. How many agreeable days have we known together! What may the next two hours produce!&mdash;</P>
<P>When I parted with my charmer (which I did with infinite reluctance, half an hour ago), it was upon her promi&s;e, that &s;he would not &s;it up to write or read. For &s;o engaging was the conver&s;ation to me (and, in|deed, my behaviour throughout the whole of it, was confe&s;&s;edly agreeable to her), that I in&s;i&s;ted, if &s;he did not directly retire to re&s;t, that &s;he &s;hould add another happy hour to the former.</P>
<P>To have &s;at up writing or reading half the night, as &s;he &s;ometimes does, would have fru&s;trated my view, as thou wilt ob&s;erve, when my little plot un|ravels.</P>

<P>But the con&s;equences mu&s;t be greater than I had thought of till this moment&mdash;My beloved's de&s;tiny or my own may depend upon the i&s;&s;ue of the two next hours!&mdash;</P>
<P>I will recede, I think!&mdash;</P>
<P>SOFT, O virgin &s;aint, and &s;afe as &s;oft, be thy &s;lumbers!&mdash;</P>
<P>I will now once more turn to my friend Belford's letter. Thou &s;halt have fair play, my charmer. I'll re-peru&s;e what thy advocate has to &s;ay for thee. Weak arguments will do, in the frame I am in!&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT, what's the matter!&mdash;What's the matter!&mdash;What a <HI>double</HI>&mdash;But the uproar abates!&mdash;What a <HI>double coward</HI> am I?&mdash;Or is it that I am taken in a cowardly minute? for heroes have their fits of <HI>fear</HI>; cowards their <HI>brave</HI> moments: And virtuous ladies, all but my Clari&s;&s;a, their moment <HI>critical</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But thus coolly enjoying thy reflections in a hurri|cane!&mdash;Again the confu&s;ion's renew'd!&mdash;</P>

<P>NOW is my reformation &s;ecur'd; for I never &s;hall love any other woman!&mdash;O &s;he is all variety! She mu&s;t be ever new to me!&mdash;<HI>Imagination</HI> cannot

form; much le&s;s can the pencil paint; nor can the &s;oul of painting, <HI>poetry,</HI> de&s;cribe an angel &s;o exqui|&s;itely, &s;o elegantly lovely!&mdash;But I will not by antici|pation pacify thy impatience. Altho' the &s;ubject is too hallowed for profane contemplation; yet &s;halt thou have the whole before thee as it pa&s;&s;ed: And this not from a &s;pirit wantoning in de&s;cription upon &s;o rich a &s;ubject; but with a de&s;ign to put a bound to thy roving thoughts.&mdash;It will be iniquity greater than a Lovelace ever was guilty of, to carry them farther than I &s;hall acknowlege.</P>
<P>Thus then, connecting my la&s;t with the pre&s;ent, I lead to it.</P>
<P>Did&s;t thou not, by the conclu&s;ion of my former, perceive the con&s;ternation I was in, ju&s;t as I was about to re-peru&s;e thy letter, in order to prevail upon my|&s;elf to recede from my purpo&s;e of awaking in terrors my &s;lumbering charmer? And what do&s;t thou think was the matter?</P>
<P>I'll tell thee&mdash;</P>
<P>At a little after two, when the whole hou&s;e was &s;till, or &s;eem'd to be &s;o, and, as it proved, my Cla|ri&s;&s;a abed, and fa&s;t a&s;leep; I al&s;o in a manner undre&s;&s;|ed, for an hour before, and in my gown and &s;lippers, tho', to oblige thee, writing on;&mdash;I was alarm'd by a trampling noi&s;e over head, and a confu&s;ed buz of mix'd voices, &s;ome louder than others, like &s;colding, and little &s;hort of &s;creaming, all rai&s;ed to vocatives, as in a fright: And while I was wondering what could be the matter, down &s;tairs ran Dorcas, and at my door, in an accent rather frightedly and hoar&s;ly in|ward, than &s;hrilly clamorous, cried out Fire! Fire! And this the more alarmed me, as &s;he &s;eem'd to endeavour to cry out louder, but could not.</P>
<P>My pen (its la&s;t &s;crawl a benediction on my be|loved) dropt from my fingers; and up &s;tarted I; and making but three &s;teps to the door, open'd it, and cry'd Where! Where! almo&s;t as much terrify'd as
<PB N="291" REF="298">
the wench. While &s;he, more than half-undre&s;t, her perticoats in her hand, unable to &s;peak di&s;tinctly, pointed up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I was there in a moment, and found all owing to the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of Mrs. Sinclair's cook-maid, who, having &s;at up to read the &s;imple hi&s;tory of Dora&s;tus and Fau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia, when &s;he &s;hould have been in bed, had &s;et fire to an old pair of callicoe window-curtains.</P>
<P>She had had the pre&s;ence of mind, in her fright, to tear down the half-burnt vallens, as well as curtains, and had got them, tho' blazing, into the chimney, by the time I came up; &s;o that I had the &s;atisfaction to find the danger happily over.</P>
<P>Mean time Dorcas, after &s;he had directed me up &s;tairs, not knowing the wor&s;t was over, and expect|ing every minute the hou&s;e would be in a blaze, out of tender regard for her lady [I &s;hall for ever love the wench for it] ran to her door, and rapping loudly at it, in a recovered voice, cry'd out, with a &s;hrilne&s;s equal to her love, Fire! Fire!&mdash;The hou&s;e is on fire!&mdash;Ri&s;e, Madam!&mdash;This in&s;tant ri&s;e&mdash;if you would not be burnt in your bed!</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had &s;he made this dreadful outcry, but I heard her lady's door, with ha&s;ty violence, unbar, unbolt, unlock, and open, and my charmer's voice &s;ounding like that of one going into a fit.</P>
<P>You may believe how much I was affected. I trembled with concern for her, and ha&s;tened down fa&s;ter than the alarm of fire had made me run up, in order to &s;atisfy her, that all the danger was over.</P>
<P>When I had <HI>flown down</HI> to her chamber-door, there I beheld the charminge&s;t creature in the world, &s;up|porting her&s;elf on the arm of the ga&s;ping Dorcas, &s;ighing, trembling, and ready to faint, with nothing on but an under-petticoat, her lovely bo&s;om half-open, and her feet ju&s;t &s;lipt into her &s;hoes. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he panted, and &s;truggled to &s;peak;
<PB N="292" REF="299">
but could only &s;ay, Oh, Mr. Lovelace! and down was ready to &s;ink.</P>
<P>I cla&s;ped her in my arms with an ardor &s;he never felt before: My deare&s;t life! fear nothing: I have been up&mdash;The danger is over&mdash;The fire is got under&mdash;And how (fooli&s;h devil! to Dorcas) could you thus, by your hideous yell, alarm and frighten my angel!</P>
<P>Oh Jack! how her &s;weet bo&s;om, as I cla&s;p'd her to mine, heav'd and panted! I could even di&s;tingui&s;h her dear heart flutter, flutter, flutter, again&s;t mine; and for a few minutes, I fear'd &s;he would go into fits.</P>
<P>Le&s;t the half-lifele&s;s charmer &s;hould catch cold in this undre&s;s, I lifted her to her bed, and &s;at down by her upon the &s;ide of it, endeavouring with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, as well of action as expre&s;&s;ion, to di&s;&s;ipate her terrors.</P>
<P>But what did I get by this my generous care of her, and by my <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> endeavour to bring her to her|&s;elf?&mdash;Nothing, ungrateful as &s;he was! but the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations: For we had both already for|got the occa&s;ion, dreadful as it was, which had thrown her into my arms; I, from the joy of incircling the almo&s;t di&s;robed body of the lovelie&s;t of her &s;ex; &s;he, from the greater terrors that aro&s;e from finding her&s;elf in my arms, and both &s;eated on the bed, from which &s;he had been &s;o lately frighted.</P>
<P>And now, Belford, reflect upon the di&s;tance the watchful charmer had hitherto kept me at. Reflect upon my love, and upon my &s;ufferings for her: Re|flect upon her vigilance, and how long I had lain in wait to elude it; the awe I had &s;tood in, becau&s;e of her frozen virtue and over-nicene&s;s; and that I never before was &s;o happy with her; and then think how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngovernable mu&s;t be my tran&s;ports in tho&s;e happy moments!&mdash;And yet, in my own account, I was both decent and generous. The following lines, alter'd to the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t per&s;on, come neare&s;t of any I can recollect, to the rapturous occa&s;ion:
<Q><PB N="293" REF="300">
<L>Bowing, I kneel'd, and her forc'd hand I pre&s;s'd,</L>
<L>With &s;weet compul&s;ion, to my beating brea&s;t;</L>
<L>O'er it, in ec&s;ta&s;y, my lips bent low,</L>
<L>And tides of &s;ighs 'twixt her gra&s;p'd fingers flow.</L>
<L>High beat my hurry'd pul&s;e, at each fierce ki&s;s,</L>
<L>And ev'ry burning &s;inew ak'd with bli&s;s.</L></Q></P>
<P>But, far from being affected by an addre&s;s &s;o fer|vent (although from a man &s;he had &s;o lately owned a regard for, and with whom, but an hour or two be|fore, &s;he had parted with &s;o much &s;atisfaction), that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> never &s;aw a bitterer, or more moving grief, when &s;he came fully to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She appealed to Heaven again&s;t my <HI>treachery,</HI> as &s;he called it; while I, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows, pleaded my own equal fright, and the reality of the danger that had alarmed us both.</P>
<P>She conjur'd me, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and affecting manner, by turns threatening and &s;oothing, to quit her apartment, and permit her to hide her&s;elf from the light, and from every human eye.</P>
<P>I be&s;ought her pardon, yet could not avoid offend|ing; and repeatedly vow'd, that the next morning's &s;un &s;hould witne&s;s our e&s;pou&s;als: But taking, I &s;up|po&s;e, all my prote&s;tations of this kind, as an indica|tion, that I intended to proceed to the la&s;t extremity, &s;he would hear nothing that I &s;aid; but, redoubling her &s;truggles to get from me, in broken accents, and exclamations the mo&s;t vehement, &s;he prote&s;ted, that &s;he would not &s;urvive, what &s;he called a treatment &s;o di&s;graceful and villainous; and, looking all wildly round her, as if for &s;ome in&s;trument of mi&s;chief, &s;he e&s;pied a pair of &s;harp-pointed &s;ci&s;&s;ars on a chair by the bed-&s;ide, and endeavoured to catch them up, with de&s;ign to make her words good on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Seeing her de&s;peration, I begged her to be pacify'd; that &s;he would hear me &s;peak but one word, declaring that I intended no di&s;honour to her: And having &s;eized
<PB N="294" REF="301">
the &s;ci&s;&s;ars, I threw them into the chimney; and &s;he &s;till in&s;i&s;ting vehemently upon my di&s;tance, I permit|ted her to take the chair.</P>
<P>But, O the &s;weet di&s;compo&s;ure!&mdash;Her bared &s;houl|ders and arms, &s;o inimitably fair and lovely: Her &s;pread hands cro&s;&s;ed over her charming neck; yet not half concealing its glo&s;&s;y beauties: The &s;canty coat, as &s;he ro&s;e from me, giving the whole of her admi|rable &s;hape, and fine-turn'd limbs: Her eyes running-over, yet &s;eeming to threaten future vengeance: And at la&s;t her lips uttering what every indignant look, and glowing feature, portended; exclaiming as if I had done the wor&s;t I could do, and vowing never to forgive me; wilt thou wonder, that I could avoid re&s;uming the incen&s;ed, the already too-much-provoked fair one?</P>
<P>I did; and cla&s;ped her once more to my bo&s;om: But, con&s;idering the delicacy of her frame, her force was amazing, and &s;hewed how much in earne&s;t &s;he was in her re&s;entment; for it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that I was able to hold her: Nor could I prevent her &s;liding through my arms, to fall upon her knees: Which &s;he did at my feet: And there, in the angui&s;h of her &s;oul, her &s;treaming eyes lifted up to my face with &s;upplicating &s;oftne&s;s, hands folded, di|&s;hevelled hair; for her night head-dre&s;s having fallen off in her &s;truggling, her charming tre&s;&s;es fell down in naturally &s;hining ringlets, as if officious to conceal the dazling beauties of her neck and &s;houlders; her lovely bo&s;om too heaving with &s;ighs, and broken &s;obs, as if to aid her quivering lips, in pleading for her&mdash;In this manner, but when her grief gave way to her &s;peech, in words pronounced with that emphatical propriety, which di&s;tingui&s;hes this admirable creature in her elocution from all the women. I ever heard &s;peak; did &s;he implore my compa&s;&s;ion, and my ho|nour.</P>

'on my knees I beg you to con&s;ider me, as a poor creature who has no protector but you; who has no defence but your honour: By that Ho|nour! By your Humanity! By all you have vow'd! I conjure you not to make me abhor my&s;elf! Not to make me vile in my own eyes!'</Q></P>
<P>I mentioned the morrow as the happie&s;t day of my life.</P>
<P>Tell me not of to-morrow; if indeed you mean me honourably, <HI>Now,</HI> This very in&s;tant NOW! you mu&s;t &s;hew it, and begone! You can never in a whole long life repair the evils you may NOW make me &s;uffer!</P>
<P>Wicked wretch!&mdash;In&s;olent villain!&mdash;[Yes, &s;he called me in&s;olent villain, altho' &s;o much in my power! And for what?&mdash;only for ki&s;&s;ing (with pa&s;|&s;ion indeed) her inimitable neck, her lips, her cheeks, her forehead, and her &s;treaming eyes, as this a&s;&s;em|blage of beauties offered it&s;elf at once to my ravi&s;hed &s;ight; &s;he continuing kneeling at my feet, as I &s;at].</P>
<P>If I <HI>am</HI> a villain, Madam&mdash;And then my gra&s;ping but trembling hand&mdash;I hope I did not hurt the ten|dere&s;t and lovelie&s;t of all her beauties&mdash;If I am a villain, Madam&mdash;</P>
<P>She tore my ruffle, &s;hrunk from my happy hand, with amazing force and agility, as with my other arm I would have incircled her wai&s;t.</P>
<P>Indeed you are!&mdash;The wor&s;t of villains!&mdash;Help! dear ble&s;&s;ed people! and &s;cream'd&mdash;No help for a poor creature!&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Am</HI> I then a villain, Madam?&mdash;<HI>Am</HI> I then a vil|lain, &s;ay you?&mdash;and cla&s;ped both my arms about her, offering to rai&s;e her to my bounding heart.&mdash;</P>
<P>O no!&mdash;And yet you are!&mdash;And again I was her <HI>dear</HI> Lovelace!&mdash;Her hands again cla&s;ped over her charming bo&s;om:&mdash;Kill me! Kill me!&mdash;If I am odious enough in your eyes, to de&s;erve this treat|ment; and I will thank you!&mdash;Too long, much

<P>Then, with &s;till folded hands, and fre&s;h-&s;treaming eyes, I was her <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> Lovelace; and &s;he would thank me with her late&s;t breath, if I would permit her to make that preference, or free her from farther in|dignities.</P>
<P>I &s;at &s;u&s;pended for a moment: By my &s;oul, thought I, thou art, upon full proof, an angel and no woman! Still, however, clo&s;e cla&s;ping her to my bo&s;om, as I had rai&s;ed her from her knees, &s;he again &s;lid through my arms, and dropt upon them:&mdash;

<P>But I had no &s;ooner enter'd my own apartment, than, reflecting upon the opportunity I had lo&s;t, and that all I had gained was but an increa&s;e of my own difficulties; and upon the ridicule I &s;hould meet with below, upon a weakne&s;s &s;o much out of my u&s;ual character; I repented, and ha&s;ten'd back, in hope, that through the di&s;tre&s;s of mind which I left her in, &s;he had not &s;o &s;oon fa&s;tened her door; and I was &s;ully re&s;olved to execute all my purpo&s;es, be the con&s;e|quence what it would; for, thought I, I have already &s;inned beyond <HI>cordial</HI> forgivene&s;s, I doubt; and if fits

and de&s;peration en&s;ue, I can but marry at la&s;t, and then I &s;hall make her amends.</P>
<P>But I was ju&s;tly puni&s;h'd;&mdash;for her door was fa&s;t: And hearing her &s;igh and &s;ob, as if her heart would bur&s;t, My beloved creature, &s;aid I, rapping gently, and her &s;obbings cea&s;ing, I want but to &s;ay three words to you, which mu&s;t be the mo&s;t acceptable you ever heard from me.

<P>I thought I heard her coming to open the door, and my heart leapt in that hope; but it was only to draw another bolt, to make it &s;till the fa&s;ter, and &s;he either could not, or would not, an&s;wer me, but retired to the further end of her apartment, to her clo&s;et, probably: And more like a fool than before, again I &s;neaked away.</P>
<P>This was my mine, my plot!&mdash;And this was all I made of it!</P>
<P>I love her more than ever!&mdash;And well I may!&mdash;Never &s;aw I &s;uch poli&s;hed ivory as her arms and &s;houlders &s;eemed to be; never touched I velvet &s;o &s;oft as her &s;kin: Then &s;uch an elegance!

Her pretty foot, in her &s;truggling, lo&s;ing her &s;hoe, but ju&s;t &s;lipped on, as I told thee, equally white and delicate as the hand of any other lady, or even as her own hand!</P>
<P>But &s;ee&s;t thou not, that I have a claim of merit for a grace that every-body hitherto had denied me? And that is, for a capacity of being moved by prayers and tears: Where, where, on this occa&s;ion, was the <HI>callus,</HI> where the flint, that my heart was &s;aid to be &s;urrounded by?</P>
<P>This, indeed, is the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in the like ca&s;e, that ever I was wrought upon. But why? Becau&s;e I never before encountered a re&s;i&s;tance &s;o much in ear ne&s;t: A re&s;i&s;tance, in &s;hort, &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>What a triumph has her &s;ex obtained in my thoughts by this trial, and this re&s;i&s;tance!</P>

Has &s;he not upon her honour already done it?&mdash;But how will the dear creature keep that part of her pro|mi&s;e, which engages her to &s;ee me in the morning, as if nothing had happened?</P>

<P>In &s;hort, I fear nothing in this lady but grief; yet that's a &s;low worker, you know; and gives time to pop in a little joy between its &s;ullen fits.</P>

<P>HER chamber-door has not yet been opened. I mu&s;t not expect &s;he will breakfa&s;t with me: Nor dine with me, I doubt. A little &s;illy &s;oul, what troubles does &s;he make to her&s;elf by her over-nice|ne&s;s!&mdash;All I have done to her, would have been looked upon as a frolick only, a romping-bout, and laughed

off by nine parts in ten of the &s;ex accordingly. The more &s;he makes of it, the more painful to her&s;elf, as well as to me.</P>
<P>Why now, Jack, were it not better, upon <HI>her own</HI> notions, that &s;he &s;eemed not &s;o &s;en&s;ible, as &s;he will make her&s;elf to be, if &s;he is very angry?</P>
<P>But perhaps I am more afraid than I need. I believe I am. From her <HI>over</HI>-nicene&s;s ari&s;es my fear, more than from any extraordinary rea&s;on for re&s;entment. Next time, &s;he may count her&s;elf very happy, if &s;he come off no wor&s;e.</P>
<P>The dear creature was &s;o frighten'd, and &s;o fatigued la&s;t night, no wonder &s;he lies it out this morning.</P>
<P>I hope &s;he has had more re&s;t than I have had: Soft and balmy, I hope, have been her &s;lumbers, that &s;he may meet me in tolerable temper. All &s;weetly blu&s;hing and confounded&mdash;I <HI>know</HI> how &s;he will look!&mdash;But why &s;hould &s;he, the <HI>&s;ufferer,</HI> be a&s;hamed, when I, the <HI>tre&s;pa&s;&s;er,</HI> am not?</P>
<P>But cu&s;tom is a prodigious thing. The ladies are told how much their blu&s;hes heighten their graces: They practi&s;e for them therefore: Blu&s;hes come as readily when they call them, as their tears: Ay, that's it! While we men, taking blu&s;hes for a &s;ign of guilt or &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s, are equally &s;tudious to &s;uppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>BY my troth, Jack, I am half as much a&s;hamed to &s;ee the women below, as my fair one can be to &s;ee me. I have not yet open'd my door, that I may not be obtruded upon by them.</P>
<P>After all, what devils may one make of the Sex!

<P>I NEVER long'd in my life for any thing with &s;o much impatience, as to &s;ee my charmer. She has been &s;tirring, it &s;eems, the&s;e two hours.</P>
<P>Dorcas ju&s;t now tapp'd at her door, to take her morning commands.</P>
<P><HI>She had none for her,</HI> was the an&s;wer.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired to know, If &s;he would not breakfa&s;t?</P>
<P>A &s;ullen and low-voiced <HI>negative</HI> &s;he received.</P>
<P>I will go my&s;elf.</P>
<P>THREE different times tapp'd I at the door, but had no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Permit me, deare&s;t creature, to inquire after your health. As you have not been &s;een to-day, I am im|patient to know how you do.</P>
<P>Not a word of an&s;wer; but a deep &s;igh, even to &s;obbing.</P>
<P>Let me beg of you, Madam, to accompany me up another pair of &s;tairs&mdash;You'll rejoice to &s;ee what a happy e&s;cape we have all had.</P>
<P>A happy e&s;cape indeed, Jack!&mdash;For the fire had &s;corched the window-board, findged the hangings, and burnt through the &s;lit-deal lining of the window-jambs.</P>
<P>No an&s;wer, Madam!&mdash;Am I not worthy of one word?&mdash;Is it thus you keep your promi&s;e with me?&mdash;Shall I not have the favour of your company for two minutes, only for two minutes, in the dining-room?</P>
<P>Hem!&mdash;And a deep &s;igh!&mdash;was all the an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="310">An&s;wer me, but how you do! An&s;wer me but that you are well!&mdash;Is this the forgivene&s;s that was the condition of my obedience?</P>
<P>Then, in a fainti&s;h but angry voice, Begone from my door!&mdash;Wretch, inhuman, barbarous, and all that's ba&s;e and treacherous!&mdash;Begone from my door! Nor teaze thus a poor creature, intitled to protection, not outrage.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, I &s;ee how you keep your word with me!&mdash;<HI>If</HI> a &s;udden impul&s;e, the effects of an unthought-of accident, cannot be forgiven&mdash;</P>
<P>O the dreadful weight of a father's cur&s;e, thus in the letter of it, &s;o likely to be fulfilled!</P>
<P>And then her voice dying away into inarticulate murmurs, I looked through the key-hole, and &s;aw her on her knees, her face, tho' not towards me, lifted up, as well as hands, and the&s;e folded, deprecating, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uppo&s;e, that gloomy tyrant's cur&s;e.</P>
<P>I could not help being moved.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t life! admit me to your pre&s;ence, but for two minutes, and confirm your promi&s;ed pardon; and may lightning bla&s;t me on the &s;pot, if I offer any thing but my penitence, at a &s;hrine &s;o &s;acred!&mdash;I will afterwards leave you for the whole day; and till to-morrow morning; then to attend, with writings, all ready to &s;ign, a licence obtained, or, if it cannot, a mini&s;ter without one. This once believe me. When you &s;ee the reality of the danger, that gave occa&s;ion for this your unhappy re&s;entment, you will think le&s;s hardly of me. And let me be&s;eech you to perform a promi&s;e, on which I made a reliance not altogether ungenerous.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ee you! Would to heaven I never had! If I write, that's all I can do.</P>
<P>Let your writing then, my deare&s;t life, confirm your promi&s;e. And I will withdraw in expectation of it.</P>

<P>Thou knowe&s;t not, nor can&s;t conceive, the pangs that wring my heart!&mdash;What can I do!&mdash;O Lord, O Lord, O Lord!</P>
<P>And thou, too, who ha&s;t endeavoured to weaken my hands, wilt but clap thy dragon's wings at the tidings!&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t write, or I &s;hall go di&s;tracted. Little le&s;s have I been the&s;e two hours; di&s;patching me&s;&s;en|gers to every &s;tage; to every inn; to every waggon or coach, whether flying or creeping, and to every hou&s;e with a bill up, for five miles round.</P>

<P>Of this I am &s;ure, <HI>or I had not brought her hither,</HI> There is not a creature belonging to this hou&s;e, that could be corrupted either by virtue or remor&s;e: The highe&s;t joy every infernal nymph of this wor&s;e than infernal habitation, <HI>could</HI> have known, would have been to reduce this proud Beauty to her own level.&mdash;And as to my villain, who al&s;o had charge of her, he is &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on'd varlet, that he delights in mi&s;chief for the &s;ake of it: No bribe could &s;educe him to be|tray his tru&s;t, were there but wickedne&s;s in it!&mdash;'Tis well, however, he was out of my way, when the cur&s;ed news was imparted to me!&mdash;Gone, the vil|lain! in que&s;t of her: Not to return, nor to &s;ee my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace (&s;o it &s;eems he declared), till he has heard &s;ome tidings of her; and all the out-of-place varlets of his numerous acquaintance, are &s;ummoned and employed in the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;niveling toad Dor|cas, who was introduced to me for my pardon by the whining mother. I gave her a kind of negative and ungracious forgivene&s;s.&mdash;Yet I &s;hall as violently cur&s;e the two nymphs, by-and-by, for the con&s;equences of my own folly: And this will be a good way too, to prevent their ridicule upon me, for lo&s;ing &s;o glorious an opportunity as I had la&s;t night, or rather this morning.</P>
<P>I have collected, from the re&s;ult of the inquiries made of the chairman, and from Dorcas's ob&s;ervations before the cruel creature e&s;caped, a de&s;cription of her dre&s;s; and am re&s;olved, if I cannot otherwi&s;e hear of her, to adverti&s;e her in the Gazette, as an eloped wife, both by her maiden and acknowleged name; for her elopement will &s;oon be known by every <HI>Enemy,</HI> why then &s;hould not my <HI>Friends</HI> be made acquainted with it, from who&s;e inquiries and informa|tions I may expect &s;ome tidings of her?</P>
<P>She had on a brown lu&s;tring night-gown, fre&s;h, and looking like new, as every thing &s;he wears does, whether new or not, from an elegance natural to her. A beaver hat, a black ribband about her neck, and blue knots on her brea&s;t. A quilted petticoat of car|nation
<PB N="325" REF="332">
coloured &s;atten; a ro&s;e-diamond ring, &s;uppo&s;ed on her finger; and in her whole per&s;on and appear|ance, as I &s;hall expre&s;s it, a dignity, as well as beauty, that commands the repeated attention of every-one who &s;ees her.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of her per&s;on, I &s;hall take a little more pains about. My mind mu&s;t be more at ea&s;e, before I can undertake that. And I &s;hall threaten, that if, after a certain period given for her voluntary return, &s;he be not heard of, I will pro&s;ecute any per|&s;on, who pre&s;umes to entertain, harbour, abett, or encourage her, with all the vengeance that an injur'd gentleman and hu&s;band may be warranted to take by Law, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>FRESH cau&s;e of aggravation!&mdash;But for this &s;crib|ling vein, or I &s;hould &s;till run mad!</P>
<P>Again going into her chamber, becau&s;e it was hers, and &s;ighing over the bed, and every piece of furni|ture in it, I ca&s;t my eye towards the drawers of the dre&s;&s;ing-gla&s;s, and &s;aw peep out, as it were, in one of the half-drawn drawers, the corner of a letter. I &s;natched it out, and found it &s;uper&s;cribed by her, <HI>To Mr. Lovelace.</HI> The &s;ight of it made my heart leap, and I trembled &s;o, that I could hardly open the &s;eal.</P>
<P>How does this damn'd Love unman me!&mdash;But nobody ever loved as I love!&mdash;It is even increa&s;ed by her unworthy flight, and my di&s;appointment. In|grateful creature, to fly from a pa&s;&s;ion thus ardently flaming! which, like the palm, ri&s;es the more for be|ing depre&s;&s;ed and &s;lighted!</P>
<P>I will not give thee a copy of this letter. I owe her not &s;o much &s;ervice.</P>
<P>But would&s;t thou think, that this haughty promi&s;e-breaker could re&s;olve, as &s;he does, ab&s;olutely and for ever to renounce me for what pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t night?

I cannot &s;upport my own reflections upon a decency &s;o ill-re|quited.&mdash;She could not, &s;he would not have been &s;o much a Harlowe in her re&s;entment had I de&s;erved, as I <HI>ought</HI> to have done, her re&s;entment. All &s;he feared, had then been over, and her own good-&s;en&s;e, and even mode&s;ty, would have taught her to make the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>But if ever again I get her into my hands, <HI>Art</HI> and more <HI>Art,</HI> and <HI>Compul&s;ion</HI> too, if &s;he make it nece&s;|&s;ary [<HI>and 'tis plain that nothing el&s;e will do</HI>], &s;hall &s;he experience from the man who&s;e fear <HI>of</HI> her has been above even his pa&s;&s;ion <HI>for</HI> her; and who&s;e gentlene&s;s and forbearance &s;he has thus <HI>perfidiou&s;ly</HI> triumphed over.

<P>WELL, Jack!&mdash;And what thinke&s;t thou of this la&s;t letter?&mdash;Mi&s;s Howe values not either <HI>fame</HI> or <HI>cen&s;ure</HI>; and thinke&s;t thou, that this letter will not bring the little fury up, tho' &s;he could procure no other conveyance than her higgler's paniers, one for her&s;elf, the other for her maid?&mdash;She knows where to come now!&mdash;Many a little villain have I puni&s;hed for knowing more than I would have her know; and that by adding to her knowlege and experience.&mdash;What thinke&s;t thou, Belford, if by getting hither this virago, and giving <HI>cau&s;e</HI> for a lamentable letter from her, to the fair fugitive, I &s;hould be able to re|cover <HI>her?</HI>&mdash;Would &s;he not vi&s;it that friend in <HI>her</HI> di&s;tre&s;s, thinke&s;t thou, who&s;e intended vi&s;it to her in <HI>hers,</HI> brought her into the condition &s;he her&s;elf had &s;o perfidiou&s;ly e&s;caped from?</P>
<P>Let me enjoy the thought!</P>
<P>Shall I &s;end this letter?&mdash;Thou &s;ee&s;t I have left room, if I fail in the exact imitation of &s;o charming a hand, to avoid too &s;trict a &s;crutiny.&mdash;Do they not both de&s;erve it of me?&mdash;See&s;t thou not how the rave|ing girl threatens her mother?&mdash;Ought &s;he not to be puni&s;h'd?&mdash;And can I be a wor&s;e devil, or villain, or
<PB N="346" REF="353">
mon&s;ter, than &s;he calls me in this letter; and has cal|led me in her former letters; were I to puni&s;h them both, as my vengeance urges me to puni&s;h them. And when I have executed That my vengeance, how charmingly &s;atisfied may they both go down into the country, and keep hou&s;e together, and have a much better rea&s;on than their pride could give them, for living the Single-life they have both &s;eemed &s;o fond of?</P>
<P>I will &s;et about tran&s;cribing it this moment, I think. I can re&s;olve afterwards. Yet what has poor Hick|man done to de&s;erve this of me?&mdash;But gloriou&s;ly would it puni&s;h the mother (as well as daughter) for all her &s;ordid avarice; and for her undutifulne&s;s to hone&s;t Mr. Howe, who&s;e heart &s;he actually broke. I am on tip-toe, Jack, to enter upon this project.&mdash;Is not one country as good to me as another, if I &s;hould be obliged to take another tour upon it?</P>
<P>BUT I will not venture. Mr. Hickman is a good man, they tell me. I love a good man. I hope one of the&s;e days to be a good man my&s;elf. Be&s;ides, I have heard within this week, &s;omething of this hone&s;t fellow that &s;hews he has a &s;oul; when I thought, if he had one, that it lay a little of the deepe&s;t to emerge to notice, except on very extraordinary occa&s;ions; and that then it pre&s;ently &s;unk again into its <HI>Cellula adi|po&s;a.</HI>&mdash;The man is a <HI>plump man.</HI>&mdash;Did&s;t ever &s;ee him, Jack?</P>
<P>But the principal rea&s;on that withholds me (for 'tis a tempting project!) is, for fear of being utterly blown up, if I &s;hould not be quick enough with my letter, or if Mi&s;s Howe &s;hould deliberate on &s;etting out, or try her mother's con&s;ent fir&s;t; in which time, a letter from my frighted beauty might reach her; for I have no doubt, where-ever &s;he has refuged, but her fir&s;t work was to write to her vixen friend. I will therefore go on patiently; and take my revenge upon the little fury at my lei&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="354">But, in &s;pite of my compa&s;&s;ion for Hickman, who&s;e better character is &s;ometimes my envy, and who is one of tho&s;e mortals that bring clum&s;ine&s;s into credit with the <HI>mothers,</HI> to the di&s;grace of us clever fellows, and often to our di&s;appointment with the <HI>daughters</HI>; and who has been very bu&s;y in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the&s;e double-arm'd beauties again&s;t me; I &s;wear by all the <HI>Dii Majores,</HI> as well as <HI>Minores,</HI> that I will have Mi&s;s Howe, if I cannot have her more exalted friend!&mdash;And then, if there be &s;o much flaming love between the&s;e girls as they pretend, what will my charmer profit by her e&s;cape?</P>
<P>And now, that I &s;hall permit Mi&s;s Howe to reign a little longer, let me a&s;k thee, If thou ha&s;t not, in the inclo&s;ed letter, a <HI>fre&s;h</HI> in&s;tance, that a great many of my difficulties with her &s;i&s;ter-toa&s;t are owing to this flighty girl?&mdash;'Tis true, that here was natural|ly a confounded &s;harp wintry air; and, if a little cold water was thrown into the path, no wonder that it was in&s;tantly frozen; and that a poor hone&s;t traveller found it next to impo&s;&s;ible to keep his way; one foot &s;liding back as fa&s;t as the other advanced; to the en|dangering of his limbs or neck. But yet I think it impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;he &s;hould have baffled me as &s;he has done (novice as &s;he is, and never before from under her parents wing), had &s;he not been armed by a virago, who was formerly very near &s;hewing, that &s;he could better advi&s;e than practi&s;e. But this, I believe, I have &s;aid more than once before.</P>
<P>I am loth to <HI>reproach my&s;elf,</HI> now the cruel crea|ture has e&s;caped me; for what would that do, but add to my torment? Since evils &s;elf-cau&s;ed, and avoidable, admit not of palliation or comfort. And yet, if <HI>thou</HI> telle&s;t me, that all <HI>her</HI> &s;trength was owing to <HI>my</HI> weakne&s;s, and that I have been a cur&s;ed coward in this whole affair; why then, Jack, I may blu&s;h, and be vexed; but, by my &s;oul, I cannot contradict thee.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="355">But this, Belford, I hope&mdash;that if I can turn the poi&s;on of this letter into whol&s;ome aliment; that is to &s;ay, if I can make u&s;e of it to my advantage; I &s;hall have <HI>thy</HI> free con&s;ent to do it.</P>
<P>I am always careful to open covers cautiou&s;ly, and to pre&s;erve &s;eals intire. I will draw out from this cur&s;ed letter an alphabet. Nor was Nick Rowe ever half &s;o diligent to learn Spani&s;h, at the Quixote re|commendation of a certain Peer, as I will be to gain a ma&s;tery of this vixen's hand.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day Evening, June</HI> 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AFter my la&s;t, &s;o full of other hopes, the contents of This will &s;urpri&s;e you. O my deare&s;t friend, the man has at la&s;t proved him&s;elf to be a villain! It was with the utmo&s;t difficulty la&s;t night, that I pre|&s;erved my&s;elf from the vile&s;t di&s;honour. He extorted from me a promi&s;e of forgivene&s;s; and that I would &s;ee him next day, as if nothing had happened: But if it were po&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape from a wretch, who, as I have too much rea&s;on to believe, formed a plot to fire the hou&s;e, to frighten me, almo&s;t naked, into his arms, how could I &s;ee him next day?</P>
<P>I have e&s;caped, Heaven be prai&s;ed, I have! And have now no other concern, than that I fly from the only hope that could have made &s;uch an hu&s;band to|lerable to me; The reconciliation with my friends, &s;o agreeably undertaken by my uncle.</P>
<P>All my pre&s;ent hope is, To find &s;ome reputable family, or per&s;on of my own Sex, who is obliged to go beyond &s;ea, or who lives abroad; I care not whi|ther; but if I might choo&s;e, in &s;ome one of our American colonies&mdash;Never to be heard of more by my relations, whom I have &s;o grievou&s;ly offended.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="356">Nor let your generous heart be moved at what I write: If I can e&s;cape the dreadfulle&s;t part of my fa|ther's malediction (for the temporary part is already in a manner fulfilled, which makes me tremble in appre|hen&s;ion of the other), I &s;hall think the wreck of my worldly fortunes a happy compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Neither is there need of the renewal of your &s;o often tender'd goodne&s;s to me: For I have with me rings and other valuables, that were &s;ent me with my cloaths, which will turn into money, to an&s;wer all I can want, till Providence &s;hall be plea&s;ed to put me into &s;ome way to help my&s;elf, if, for my further puni&s;h|ment, my life is to be lengthen'd beyond my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Impute not this &s;cheme, my beloved friend, either to dejection on one hand, or to that romantic turn on the other, which we have &s;uppo&s;ed generally to ob|tain with our Sex, from Fifteen to Twenty-two: For, be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider my unhappy &s;ituation, in the light in which it really mu&s;t appear to every con&s;ider|ate per&s;on, who knows it. In the fir&s;t place, the man, who has had the a&s;&s;urance to think me, and to endeavour to make me, his <HI>property,</HI> will hunt me, and to place to place, and &s;earch after me as an e&s;tray: And he knows he may do &s;o with impunity; for whom have I to protect me from him?</P>
<P>Then as to my e&s;tate, the enviable e&s;tate, which has been the original cau&s;e of all my misfortunes, it &s;hall never be mine upon litigated terms. What is there in being enabled to boa&s;t, that I am worth more than <HI>I can u&s;e,</HI> or <HI>wi&s;h to u&s;e?</HI>&mdash;And if my power is circum&s;cribed, I &s;hall not have that to an&s;wer for, which I &s;hould have, if I did not u&s;e it as I ought: Which very few do. I &s;hall have no hu&s;band, of who&s;e intere&s;t I ought to be &s;o regardful, as to pre|vent me doing <HI>more</HI> than ju&s;tice to others, that I may not do <HI>le&s;s</HI> to him.&mdash;If therefore, my father will be plea&s;ed (as I &s;hall pre&s;ume, in proper time, to propo&s;e to him) to pay two annuities out of it, one to my
<PB N="350" REF="357">
dear Mrs. Norton, which may make her ea&s;y for the remainder of her life, as &s;he is now growing into years; the other of 50 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> to the &s;ame good wo|man, for the u&s;e of <HI>My poor,</HI> as I have had the vanity to call a certain &s;et of people, concerning whom &s;he knows all my mind; that &s;o as few as po&s;&s;ible may &s;uffer by the con&s;equences of my error; God ble&s;s them, and give them heart's-ea&s;e and content with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Other rea&s;ons for my taking the &s;tep I have hinted at, are the&s;e:</P>
<P>This wicked man knows I have no friend in the world but you: Your neighbourhood therefore would be the fir&s;t he would &s;eek for me in, were you to think it po&s;&s;ible for me to be concealed in it: And in this ca&s;e You might be &s;ubjected to inconveniencies greater even than tho&s;e which you have already &s;u&s;tained on my account.</P>
<P>From my cou&s;in Morden, were he to come, I could not hope protection; &s;ince, by his letter to me, it is evident, that my brother has engaged him in his party: Nor would I, by any means, &s;ubject &s;o worthy a man to danger; as might be the ca&s;e, from the violence of this ungovernable &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The&s;e things con&s;idered, what better method can I take, than to go abroad to &s;ome one of the Engli&s;h co|lonies; where nobody but your&s;elf &s;hall know any|thing of me; nor You, let me tell you, pre&s;ently, nor till I am fixed, and, if it plea&s;e God, in a cour&s;e of living tolerably to my mind. For it is no &s;mall part of my concern, that my indi&s;cretions have laid &s;o heavy a tax upon You, my dear friend, to whom, once, I hoped to give more plea&s;ure than pain.</P>
<P>I am at pre&s;ent at one Mrs. Moore's at Hamp|&s;tead. My heart mi&s;gave me at coming to this vil|lage, becau&s;e I had been here with him more than once: But the coach hither was &s;o ready a conveni|ency, that I knew not what to do better. Then I &s;hall &s;tay here no longer than till I can receive your
<PB N="351" REF="358">
an&s;wer to this: In which you will be plea&s;ed to let me know, if I cannot be hid, according to your former contrivance [Happy, had I given into it at the time!] by Mrs. Town&s;end's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, till the heat of his &s;earch be over. The Deptford road, I imagine, will be the right direction, to hear of a pa&s;&s;age, and to get &s;afely aboard.</P>
<P>O why was the great fiend of all unchained, and permitted to a&s;&s;ume &s;o &s;pecious a form, and yet allow|ed to conceal his feet and his talons, till with the one he was ready to trample upon my honour, and to &s;trike the other into my heart!&mdash;And what had I done, that he &s;hould be let loo&s;e particularly upon me!</P>
<P>Forgive me this murmuring que&s;tion, the effect of my impatience, my <HI>guilty</HI> impatience, I doubt: For, as I have e&s;caped with my honour, and nothing but my worldly pro&s;pects, and my pride, my ambition, and my vanity, have &s;uffered in this wreck of my hopefuller fortunes, may I not &s;till be more happy than I de&s;erve to be? And is it not in my own power &s;till, by the divine favour, to &s;ecure the great &s;take of all? And who knows, that this very path into which my incon&s;ideration has thrown me, &s;trew'd as it is with briars and thorns, which tear in pieces my gaudier trappings, may not be the right path to lead me into the great road to my future happine&s;s; which might have been endanger'd by evil communication?</P>
<P>And after all, Are there not &s;till more de&s;erving per&s;ons than I, who never failed in any capital point of duty, that have been more humbled than my&s;elf; and &s;ome too, by the errors of parents and relations, by the tricks and ba&s;ene&s;s of guardians, and tru&s;tees, and in which their own ra&s;hne&s;s or folly had no part?</P>
<P>I will then endeavour to make the be&s;t of my pre|&s;ent lot. And join with me, my be&s;t, my only friend, in praying, That my puni&s;hment may end here; and that my pre&s;ent afflictions may be &s;anctified to me.</P>
<P>This letter will enable you to account for a line or
<PB N="352" REF="359">
two, which I &s;ent to Wil&s;on's, to be carried to you, only for a feint, to get his &s;ervant out of the way. He &s;eemed to be left, as I thought, for a &s;py upon me. But returning too &s;oon, I was forced to write a few lines for him to carry to his Ma&s;ter, to a tavern near Doctors-Commons, with the &s;ame view: And this happily an&s;wered my end.</P>
<P>I wrote early in the morning a bitter letter to the wretch, which I left for him obvious enough; and I &s;uppo&s;e he has it by this time. I kept no copy of it. I &s;hall recollect the contents, and give you the parti|culars of all, at more lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure you will approve of my e&s;cape&mdash;The ra|ther, as the people of the hou&s;e mu&s;t be very vile: For they, and that Dorcas too, did hear me (I know they did) cry out for help: If the fire had been other than a villainous plot (altho' in the morning, to blind them, I pretended to think it otherwi&s;e), they would have been alarmed as much as I; and have run in, hearing me &s;cream, to <HI>comfort me,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing my terror was the fire; to <HI>relieve me,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing it were any|thing el&s;e. But the vile Dorcas went away, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw the wretch throw his arms about me!&mdash;Ble&s;s me, my dear, I had only my &s;lippers and an under-petticoat on. I was frighted out of my bed, by her cries of fire; and that I &s;hould be burnt to a&s;hes in a moment!&mdash;And &s;he to go away, and never to return, nor any-body el&s;e: And yet I heard wo|mens voices in the next room; indeed I did.&mdash;An evident contrivance of them all:&mdash;God be prai&s;ed, I am out of their hou&s;e!</P>
<P>My terror is not yet over: I can hardly think my|&s;elf &s;afe: Every well-dre&s;&s;ed man I &s;ee from my win|dows, whether on hor&s;eback or on foot, I think to be him.</P>
<P>I know you will expedite an an&s;wer. A man and hor&s;e will be procured me to-morrow early, to carry This. To be &s;ure, you cannot return an an&s;wer by the

<P>Mrs. Moore, at who&s;e hou&s;e I am, is a widow, and of a good character: And of this, one of her neigh|bours, of whom I bought a handkerchief, purpo&s;ely to make inquiry before I would venture, informed me.</P>
<P>I will not &s;et my foot out of doors, till I have your direction: And I am the more &s;ecure, having dropt words to the people of the hou&s;e where the coach &s;et me down, as if I expected a chariot to meet me in my way to Hendon, a village a little di&s;tance from this.&mdash;And when I left their hou&s;e, I walked back|ward and forward upon the hill, at fir&s;t not knowing what to do, and afterwards, to be certain that I was not watched, before I ventured to inquire after a lodging.</P>
<P>You will direct for me, my dear, by the name of Mrs. Harriot Lucas.</P>
<P>Had I not made my e&s;cape when I did, I was re|&s;olved to attempt it again and again. He was gone to the Commons for a licence, as he wrote me word; for I refu&s;ed to &s;ee him, notwith&s;tanding the promi&s;e he extorted from me.</P>
<P>How hard, how next-to impo&s;&s;ible, my dear, to avoid many le&s;&s;er deviations, when we are betrayed into a capital one!</P>
<P>For fear I &s;hould not get away at my fir&s;t effort, I had appri&s;ed him, that I would not &s;et eye upon him under a week, in order to gain my&s;elf time for it in different ways&mdash;And were I &s;o to have been watched, as to have made it nece&s;&s;ary, I would, after &s;uch an in&s;tance of the connivance of the women of the hou&s;e, have run out into the &s;treet, and thrown my&s;elf into the

<P>When I began, I thought to write but a few lines. But, be my &s;ubject what it will, I know not how to conclude, when I write to you.

<P>I received it about half an hour ago, ju&s;t as I was going to lie down in my cloaths: And it has made me &s;o much alive, that, midnight as it is, I have &s;ent for a Blunt's chariot, to attend me here by day-peep, with <HI>my u&s;ual coachman,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible; and knowing not el&s;e what to do with my&s;elf, I &s;at down, and, in the joy of my heart, have not only wrote thus far, but have concluded upon the mea&s;ures I &s;hall take when admitted to her pre&s;ence: For well am I aware of the difficulties I &s;hall have to contend with from her per|ver&s;ene&s;s.</P>

<P>DO not give me cau&s;e to dread your return. If you would not that I &s;hould hate you for ever, &s;end me half a line by the bearer, to a&s;&s;ure me that you will not attempt to &s;ee me for a week to come. I can|not look you in the face without equal confu&s;ion and indignation. The obliging me in This is but a poor atonement for your la&s;t night's vile behaviour.</P>
<P>You may pa&s;s this time in a journey to your uncle's;

and I cannot doubt, if the Ladies of your family are as favourable to me, as you have a&s;&s;ured me they are, but that you will have intere&s;t enough to prevail with one of them, to oblige me with her company.

<P>If Captain Tomlin&s;on comes mean time, I can hear what he has to &s;ay, and &s;end you an account of it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Now, Belford, what can&s;t thou &s;ay in behalf of this &s;weet rogue of a Lady? What <HI>can&s;t</HI> thou &s;ay for her? 'Tis apparent, that &s;he was fully determined upon an elopement, when &s;he wrote it: And thus would &s;he make me of party again&s;t my&s;elf, by drawing me in to give her a week's time to compleat it in: And, wickeder &s;till, &s;end me upon a fool's errand to bring up one of my cou&s;ins:&mdash;When we came, to have the &s;atisfaction of finding her gone off, and me expo&s;ed for ever!&mdash;What puni&s;hment can be bad enough for &s;uch a little villain of a Lady!</P>
<P>But mind, moreover, how plau&s;ibly &s;he accounts by this billet (&s;uppo&s;ing &s;he had no opportunity of eloping before I returned) for the re&s;olution of not &s;eeing me for a week; and for the bread and butter expedient!&mdash;So childi&s;h as we thought it!</P>
<P>The chariot is not come; and if it were, it is yet too &s;oon for every-thing but my impatience. And as I have already taken all my mea&s;ures, and can think of nothing but my triumph, I will re&s;ume her violent letter, in order to &s;trengthen my re&s;olutions again&s;t
<PB N="359" REF="366">
her. I was <HI>before</HI> in too gloomy a way to proceed with it: But now the &s;ubject is all alive to me, and my gayer fancy, like the &s;un-beams, will irradiate it, and turn the &s;olemn deep green into a brighter ver|dure.</P>
<P>When I have called upon my charmer to explain &s;ome parts of her letter, and to atone for others, I will &s;end it, or a copy of it, to thee.</P>
<P>Suffice it at pre&s;ent to tell thee, in the fir&s;t place, that <HI>&s;he is determined never to be my wife.</HI>&mdash;To be &s;ure, there ought to be no compul&s;ion in &s;o material a ca&s;e. Compul&s;ion was her parents fault, which I have cen|&s;ured &s;o &s;everely, that I &s;hall hardly be guilty of the &s;ame. And I am glad I know her mind as to this e&s;&s;ential point.</P>
<P>I have <HI>ruined</HI> her, &s;he &s;ays!&mdash;Now that's a fib, take it in her own way:&mdash;If I had, &s;he would not perhaps have run away from me.</P>
<P>She is <HI>thrown upon the wide world:</HI> Now I own, that Hamp&s;tead-Heath affords very pretty, and very <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> pro&s;pects; but 'tis not the <HI>wide world</HI> nei|ther: And &s;uppo&s;e <HI>that</HI> to be her grievance, I hope &s;oon to re&s;tore her to a <HI>narrower.</HI></P>
<P>I am the <HI>enemy of her &s;oul, as well as of her ho|nour!</HI>&mdash;Confoundedly &s;evere! Neverthele&s;s, another fib!&mdash;For I love her &s;oul very well; but think no more of it in this ca&s;e than of my own.</P>
<P>She is to be <HI>thrown upon &s;trangers!</HI>&mdash;And is not that her own fault?&mdash;Much again&s;t my will, I am &s;ure!</P>
<P>She is ca&s;t from a &s;tate of <HI>independency into one of obli|gation.</HI> She never was in a &s;tate of <HI>independency</HI>; nor is it fit a woman &s;hould, of any age, or in any &s;tate of life. And as to the &s;tate of obligation, there is no &s;uch thing as living without being beholden to &s;ome|body. Mutual obligation is the very e&s;&s;ence and &s;oul of the &s;ocial and commercial life:&mdash;Why &s;hould <HI>&s;he</HI> be exempt from it?&mdash;I am &s;ure the per&s;on &s;he raves

at, de&s;ires not &s;uch an exemption;&mdash;has been long <HI>dependent</HI> upon her, and would rejoice to owe <HI>further obligations</HI> to her, than he can boa&s;t of hitherto.</P>
<P>She talks of her <HI>father's cur&s;e:</HI>&mdash;But have I not repaid him for it an hundred-fold, in the &s;ame coin? But why mu&s;t the faults of other people be laid at my door? Have I not enow of my own?</P>
<P>But the grey-eyed dawn begins to peep&mdash;Let me &s;um up all.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, then, the dear creature's letter is a col|lection of invectives not very new to <HI>me</HI>; though the occa&s;ion for them, no doubt, is new to <HI>her.</HI> A little &s;prinkling of the romantic and contradictory runs thro' it. She loves, and &s;he hates: She encourages me to pur&s;ue her, by telling me I &s;afely may; and yet &s;he begs I will not: She apprehends poverty and want, yet re&s;olves to give away her e&s;tate: To gratify whom?&mdash;Why, in &s;hort, tho&s;e who have been the cau&s;e of her misfortunes. And finally, tho' &s;he re|&s;olves never to be mine, yet &s;he has &s;ome regrets at leaving me, becau&s;e of the opening pro&s;pects of a reconciliation with her friends.</P>
<P>But never did morning dawn &s;o tardily as this!&mdash;The chariot not yet come neither.</P>
<P>A GENTLEMAN to &s;peak with me, Dorcas?&mdash;Who can want me thus early?</P>
<P>Captain Tomlin&s;on, &s;ay&s;t thou! Surely he mu&s;t have travelled all night!&mdash;Early ri&s;er as I am, how could he think to find me up <HI>thus</HI> early?</P>
<P>Let but the chariot come, and he &s;hall accompany me in it to the bottom of the hill (tho' he return to town on foot; for the Captain is all obliging good|ne&s;s), that I may hear all he has to &s;ay, and tell him all my mind, and lo&s;e no time.</P>
<P>Well, now am I &s;atisfied, that this rebellious flight will turn to my advantage, as all cru&s;h'd rebellions do to the advantage of a Sovereign in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="368">DEAR Captain, I rejoice to &s;ee you: Ju&s;t in the nick of time:&mdash;See! See!</P>
<Q><L>The ro&s;y-finger'd morn appears,</L>
<L>And from her mantle &s;hakes her tears;</L>
<L>The &s;un ari&s;ing, mortals chears,</L>

<P>Excu&s;e me, Sir, that I &s;alute you, from my favour|ite Bard. He that ri&s;es with the Lark, will &s;ing with the Lark. Strange news &s;ince I &s;aw you, Captain!

You mu&s;t accompany me part of the way. I know the delight you take in compo&s;ing differences. But 'tis the task of the Prudent to heal the breaches made by the ra&s;hne&s;s and folly of the Imprudent.</P>
<P>AND now (all around me &s;o &s;till, and &s;o &s;ilent) the rattling of the chariot-wheels at a &s;treet's di&s;tance, do I hear!&mdash;And to this angel of a Lady I fly!</P>
<P>Reward, O God of Love (the cau&s;e is thy own); reward thou, as it de&s;erves, my &s;uffering per&s;evere|ance!&mdash;Succeed my endeavours to bring back to thy obedience, this charming fugitive!&mdash;Make her ac|knowlege her ra&s;hne&s;s; repent her in&s;ults; implore my forgivene&s;s; beg to be re-in&s;tated in my favour, and that I will bury in oblivion the remembrance of her heinous offence again&s;t thee, and again&s;t me, thy faithful votary.</P>
<P>THE chariot at the door!&mdash;I come! I come!&mdash;</P>
<P>I attend you, good Captain&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, Sir&mdash;Civility is not ceremony.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="369">And now, dre&s;&s;ed like a bridegroom, my heart elated beyond that of the mo&s;t de&s;iring one (attended by a footman whom my Beloved never &s;aw), I am already at Hamp&s;tead!</P>
