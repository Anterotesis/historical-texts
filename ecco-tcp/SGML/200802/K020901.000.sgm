<P>THE hint of this Piece was taken from one of the <HI>Contes Moraux</HI> of <HI>Marmon|tel,</HI> &s;tiled <HI>L'Hereux Divorce.</HI> The foible ri|diculed in the tale is, perhaps, the only one imputed to our &s;ex which has never yet been expo&s;ed by a theatrical repre&s;entation. It is a &s;implicity, not a coquetry; it is the error of a delicate and elevated mind, unacquainted with the manners of real life, or the general frame of the human heart.</P>
<P>The novel was too barren of incident to furni&s;h out an entertainment for the &s;tage, which obliged me to contrive an intire un|der-plot, and introduce &s;everal new charac|ters into the Comedy, which I &s;hall not take up the reader's time to point out here; and &s;ubmit this performance to the candor and clemency of the public, after having, per|haps, too adventurou&s;ly hazarded their criti|ci&s;m and cen&s;ure.</P>

<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>_I REJOICE to find that your lady&s;hip's good nature is as much delighted as mine, at lady Frankland's happy e&s;cape from the galling chain of matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Clarinda, I look upon it, that next to the felicity of widowhood is that of being &s;epa|rated. However, there are, my dear, &s;ome mate|rial differences: While the tyrant lives to whom we have been bound, we never can forget we have been &s;laves. There are, be&s;ides, &s;ome other di&s;|agreeable circum&s;tances which attend a &s;eparation, from which, thank Heaven, my &s;tate is free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean, I &s;uppo&s;e, the power a hu&s;band has of withdrawing alimony, in ca&s;e of indi&s;cretion, and forcing the wretched wife upon certain <HI>moyens de vivre,</HI> whether &s;he will or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. Now you know that &s;ince that Gothic &s;tatute of the Black-Ram, in the North-we&s;t Rid|ing, has been aboli&s;hed, we widows may chu&s;e what hobby-hor&s;e we plea&s;e; &s;ometimes, for varie|ty, perhaps an a&s;s; but oh! defend me from a mule, 'tis &s;o va&s;tly like a hu&s;band.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the happie&s;t &s;imile in the world: for, on my con&s;cience, they &s;eem equally to be deviations from the laws of nature. However, when broke, from re&s;tivene&s;s, they are the be&s;t pack-&s;addle am|blers in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, my dear Clarinda, that we have got this pretty little bird out of its cage, what think you will it do with its freedom? 'Tis va&s;tly wild, and will, I imagine, take flight to &s;ome Arcadian grove, and &s;it and &s;ing alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no; that mu&s;t not be: it would di&s;grace our general&s;hip. She dies for &s;entimental pa&s;&s;ion; and when once her romance is known, I warrant we &s;hall be able to &s;upply her with pretenders enough, who may a&s;&s;ume by turns, the crook and &s;crip, the helmet and the lance, to hold her in play. Nay, piqued as &s;he was at what &s;he &s;tiled lord Frank|land's indifference toward her, I am per&s;uaded that if one tender tear had but gli&s;tened in his eye, at the in&s;tant of their &s;eparation, &s;he would have &s;unk into his arms, and like the plaintive turtle, have
<PB N="3" REF="10">
moaned and cooed away the remainder of her life, in true conjugal in&s;ipidity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;urprized this did not happen, for I am quite of opinion that lord Frankland loves her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>He certainly does; but then he did not deify her. My lord knows him&s;elf to be a mere mortal man, and has not the pre&s;umption of lxion, to cope with godde&s;&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>He once, I think, admired you, Clarinda; it was thought you liked him too: how happened you to e&s;cape the noo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Platonics, lady Fan&s;haw, all Platonics. So vul|gar a notion as matrimony, never once, I believe, entered either of our heads; and I dare &s;wear he wi&s;hes now, that he had never changed his mind &s;ince in that article.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis po&s;&s;ible he may; and that at length, tired with the petti&s;hne&s;s of a &s;poiled child, he may re|turn and throw his devoirs again at the feet of one who will at lea&s;t treat him like a rea&s;onable creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare not indulge the hope; but I &s;hall endea|vour though, to lay every ob&s;tacle in the way to their re-union. Lady Frankland is young and hand&s;ome; &s;he may be virtuous too; but how long that &s;ame fortre&s;s, called Cha&s;tity, will hold out when be&s;ieged by flattery, the love of which is her chief foible, I cannot &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why ju&s;t as long, Clarinda, as any other fortre&s;s, where the governor loves money, and the be&s;iegers come up to his price. But among tho&s;e who either are, or pretend to be, her adorers, I cannot yet per|ceive that &s;he has &s;hewn the &s;malle&s;t preference; and I really believe that &s;he admires Alexander, Cy|rus, or Orondates, more than any man alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps &s;he may think &s;o too; but be a&s;&s;ured, lady Fan&s;haw, that any per&s;on who ardently de&s;ires to in&s;pire a <HI>romantic</HI> pa&s;&s;ion is not un&s;u&s;ceptible of a <HI>natural</HI> one; and when that takes place, &s;he will e'en act an old proverb, and accept of the <HI>living dog,</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>dead lion.</HI></P>

<P>Upon my word, lady Frankland, you will &s;poil tho&s;e fine eyes of yours, with con&s;tant poring; and then, I fear you will become &s;o very, very wi&s;e too, that our beaux won't be able to conver&s;e with you, and we &s;hall ab&s;olutely be de&s;erted by every crea|ture, but the grave Sir William Belville, who I be|lieve reads a little, and the &s;agacious coun&s;ellor Frankland, learned in the laws.</P>

<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, Emilia, I almo&s;t wi&s;h I had never learned my letters; &s;or the delicate and refined &s;en|timents, which books have in&s;pired me with, have only &s;erved to di&s;gu&s;t me with almo&s;t all mankind.</P>

<P>Grant it; you mu&s;t allow that I e&s;cape much pain: And I am per&s;uaded, that your lady&s;hip might have been as happy with lord Frankland, as any woman in England, if your ideas had not been perverted and di&s;turbed by an heap of vile roman|tic tra&s;h.</P>

<P>No, Emilia, it was impo&s;&s;ible. But let me not accu&s;e my lord for this; my ill &s;tars only were to blame.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear wild girl, you have wandered very far from my meaning. When I accu&s;ed my fate, in order to excu&s;e my lord, it was for not having af|forded me &s;ome glorious opportunity of manife&s;t|ing a pa&s;&s;ion for him, by &s;ome noble, generous deed, which mu&s;t have extorted his admiration, his gratitude, and love. For, to deal candidly, what right had I to have expected that lord Frankland &s;hould be a pa&s;&s;ionate lover? what &s;acrifice had I made him? by what heroic devotement had I awakened the &s;en&s;ibility of his &s;oul? where was the merit of having obeyed my parents, and accepted for an hu&s;band one, to whom I could po&s;&s;ibly have no exception?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear lady Frankland, you talk &s;trange|ly, and put me in mind of a young lady of my ac|quaintance, deeply ver&s;ed in romance, who, with a
<PB N="12" REF="19">
large fortune, ran away with an en&s;ign; but when they had got clear off, &s;he would not be content unle&s;s he returned and &s;uffered her to leap out of a window to him: The experiment was made, and the poor lady di&s;covered, and confined, till a more &s;uitable match could be found out for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>With which, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he was mi&s;erable for life. Why &s;hould love meddle in matches of con|venience? Oh, ye delights of &s;en&s;ible &s;ouls! charms of impa&s;&s;ioned hearts! where are ye? alas! in free and independent love alone, in the mutual yield|ing of two fond hearts, which have be&s;towed them|&s;elves!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, for Heaven's &s;ake, dear lady Frankland, don't run on at this rate! I vow I am frightened le&s;t you &s;hould tempt me to throw away my&s;elf and fortune, upon &s;ome beggar in pur&s;uit of the&s;e &s;ame tran&s;ports, which, after all, I do not believe are to be found any where but in the heated imagination of &s;ome poet or romance-monger.</P>
</SP>

<P>I hope that my dear Emilia will experience every happine&s;s which &s;he can wi&s;h.

<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a&s;toni&s;hed, Sir Harry, to hear you preach &s;uch ab&s;urd doctrine: Lady Frankland is very young; her ignorance is therefore pardonable; but give me leave, who have been my own mi&s;tre&s;s the&s;e ten years, to in&s;truct her lady&s;hip in the charms and u&s;e of liberty, and I fancy &s;he will find there is &s;omething in them more than <HI>a name.</HI></P>

<P>Madam, I bow to your &s;uperior judgment, and mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not know a more experienced guide, to all the paths of plea&s;ure. You and the gay Clarinda here, would have made notable prie&s;t|e&s;&s;es,

<P>There lies the difficulty, Sir Harry.

really the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing an hu&s;band, is in gene|ral &s;o very languid, that a fine woman &s;eldom ex|erts her mo&s;t amiable qualities, toward him. To charm, to conquer, &s;he re&s;erves for other eyes, and other hearts than his.</P>

<P>Well then, all I know of the matter is, that ju&s;t now as I entered the park, I &s;aw the&s;e gen|tlemen both draw their &s;words, and engage; and before I could get up to the place, Sir William had become ma&s;ter of Sir Harry's &s;word.</P>

<PB N="48" REF="55">
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is perhaps, the very rea&s;on why they fought about her. A woman in her circum&s;tances, is looked upon as lawful plunder, to which the long|e&s;t &s;word gives a title.</P>

<P>My dear unhappy friend, I am grieved to the heart for her. I was going to vi&s;it lord Frankland, ju&s;t acro&s;s the park, but I &s;hall fir&s;t return to her for a few minutes. I intreat, Clarinda, that you will not mention this affair to any mortal.</P>

<P>YOU cannot imagine, my dear Emilia, how much I am &s;hocked at what you have told me. I fear I &s;hall now become a common topic of di&s;|cour&s;e. What a triumph for lord Frankland! his character will ri&s;e upon the ruin of mine.&mdash;Good heaven, what will become of me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear lady Frankland, you fir&s;t de|ceive your&s;elf, and then argue right, upon wrong principles. You mu&s;t certainly imagine lord Frank|land a mon&s;ter, before you can &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for him to rejoice at your di&s;honour. On the con|trary, I am certain he would be &s;en&s;ible of the highe&s;t concern, were he acquainted even with your pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<SP>

<P>O! do not &s;ay &s;o, Emilia, I can bear his re&s;ent|ment better than his pity. I fear I have de|&s;erved the one, and am certain I have no claim to the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You judge too hardly of your&s;elf, my dear; but I have &s;trong hopes that this unlucky affair will never reach his, or any other ears. Sir Harry has nothing to boa&s;t of; we may therefore depend on his &s;ilence; and I have too good an opinion of Sir William Belville, to &s;uppo&s;e him capable of ever

mentioning it; and I would not have your lady&s;hip &s;eem to know one word of the matter.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FRANKLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grant it &s;hould remain a &s;ecret, Emilia; how painful mu&s;t my &s;ituation be! con&s;cious of the highe&s;t obligation, which I mu&s;t not acknowledge, even to the generous hand that has conferr'd it To a mind open and grateful as mine, this mu&s;t be torture.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care, lady Frankland, of over-rating the obligation. Sir William knows that your &s;ituation cannot admit of a return, and if I am not much deceiv'd with regard to his character, his &s;enti|ments are too generous to expect one.</P>

<P>That may perhaps be one rea&s;on for our &s;taying at home, Sir William. I hate crowds of every kind.</P>

&s;carce be &s;uch a thing as a crowd: &s;elect parties and rational conver&s;ation, would then become the fa&s;hion.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't tell you how much I am di&s;appointed at the folly of that coxcomb, Sir Harry&mdash;I had great hopes that his &s;pirited a&s;&s;urance might have conquered her timid ba&s;hfulne&s;s; and a breach once
<PB N="78" REF="85">
made in that ba&s;tion, the citadel falls of cour&s;e. I begin to fear &s;he'll conterwork us all, and either keep the fortre&s;s in her own hands, or perhaps de|liver it back again to the former governor, in <HI>&s;tatu quo.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't agree with you, Clarinda, though even Sir Harry has failed. For I dare &s;wear no woman ever parted from her hu&s;band, with a de&s;ign of playing the drude with all the re&s;t of the world. I fancy now, that Sir William will carry the town&mdash;not by &s;torm indeed, but by &s;tarving the be|&s;ieged into terms of capitulation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't under&s;tand your lady&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, in plainer Engli&s;h, Sir William is grown jealous, and will, if po&s;&s;ible, prevent any other man from coming near her. By this means, &s;he will find her&s;elf pri&s;oner, and may then probably &s;urrender her per&s;on, to obtain her liberty, en parole, at lea&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You deal &s;till in tropes, Lady Fan&s;haw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but you under&s;tand me, for all that, Clarinda. You know full well that when a woman puts her&s;elf into the power of a man, he becomes a tyrant, &s;he a &s;lave, from that moment; and all the difference I can find, between marriage and gallan|try, is, that one is perpetual, the other temporary, only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I care not by what means her ruin is accom|pli&s;hed, provided it be accompli&s;hed. Her fatal marriage with Lord Frankland, bla&s;ted all my
<PB N="79" REF="86">
hopes, and I cannot bear to think that &s;he &s;hould ta&s;te the heart-felt joy of her own virtue, while I am de|prived of that, as well as of what I re&s;igned it for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, as to that Clarinda, it is no &s;uch mighty matter, that one need wi&s;h to rob her of it, for we both know with regard to the world, the appearance will an&s;wer, as well as the reality. But if you are bent upon her ruin, bla&s;t her reputation, my dear&mdash;The &s;tory you told me of the duel, pro|perly managed, is &s;ufficient to do that effectually.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>That alone &s;hall de&s;troy her fame, &s;hould &s;he even pre&s;erve her cha&s;tity, which you &s;eem to think improbable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have half a &s;core vi&s;its to make to morrow morning and I &s;hall take care to whi&s;per this ad|venture in every one of them, with the tendere&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of pity for her misfortune, and a <Q>who could have &s;u&s;pected it?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARINDA.</SPEAKER>
<P>This will do, my dear Lady Fan&s;haw; for let women value them&s;elves ever &s;o much upon their in|nocence, the lo&s;s of character is next to that of virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady FANSHAW.</SPEAKER>
<P>O much wor&s;e, Clarinda&mdash;But I mu&s;t go and vi&s;it that &s;imple Sir Harry, as he is confined; I own I de&s;pi&s;e him, but to per&s;ons of certain ranks in life, one mu&s;t be civil, you know.</P>
