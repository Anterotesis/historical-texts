<P>_YOU will be &s;o good, my dear friend, as to let my neighbours, particularly the gentlemen you mention, know, that the only rea&s;on I forbear paying my compliments to them, now I am &s;o near, is, becau&s;e I cannot as yet enjoy their company with that freedom and ea&s;e which I hope in a little while to do. Tell them, that I pur|po&s;e, after &s;ome particular affairs are determined (which will for a little while longer engro&s;s me) to devote the greate&s;t part of my time to my native place; and that then I will endeavour to make my&s;elf as good a neighbour, and as &s;ocial a friend, as they can wi&s;h me to be.</P>
<P>On Sunday I had a vi&s;it from the two Hartleys.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
They gave me very &s;atisfactory proofs of what they were able to do, as well as willing, in &s;upport of the right of the Mansfields to the e&s;tate of which they have been de&s;poiled; and &s;hewed me a paper, which no|body thought was in being, of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>On Monday, by appointment, I attended Sir John Lambton. Two lawyers of the Keelings were with him. They produced their demands. I had mine ready; but theirs were &s;o extravagant, that I would not produce them: But, taking Sir John a&s;ide, I love not, &s;aid I, to affront men of a profe&s;&s;ion; but I am convinced, that we never &s;hall come to an under|&s;tanding, if we con&s;ider our&s;elves as Lawyers and Clients. I am no lawyer; but I know the &s;trength of my friends cau&s;e, and will ri&s;que half my e&s;tate upon the ju&s;tice of it. The Mansfields will com|mi&s;&s;ion <HI>me,</HI> if the Keelings will <HI>you;</HI> and we perhaps may do &s;omething: If not, let the Law take its cour&s;e. I am now come to re&s;ide in England. I will do no|thing for my&s;elf, till I have done what can be done to make all my friends ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Sir John owned, that he thought the Mansfields had hard&s;hips done them. Mr. Keeling &s;enior, he &s;aid, had heard of the paper in the Hartley's hands; and, prai&s;ing his hone&s;ty, told me in confidence, that he had declared, that if &s;uch a paper could have been produced in time, he would not have pro&s;ecuted the &s;uit, which he had carried. But Sir John &s;aid, that the younger Keeling was a furious young man, and would oppo&s;e a compromi&s;e on the terms he &s;uppo&s;ed the Mansfields would expect to be complied with. But what are your propo&s;als, Sir?</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir John: The Law is expen&s;ive; delays may be meditated; appeals may be brought, if we gain our point.&mdash;What I think it may co&s;t us to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the right of the injured, which cannot be a &s;mall &s;um, that will I prevail upon the Mansfields to
<PB N="3" REF="4">
give up to the Keelings. I will tru&s;t you, if you give me your honour, with our proofs; and if you and your friends are &s;atisfied with them, and will con&s;ent to e&s;tabli&s;h our right by the form only of a new trial; then may we be agreed: Otherwi&s;e, not. And I leave you and them to con&s;ider of it. I &s;hall hear from you within two or three days. Sir John promi&s;ed I &s;hould; but hoped to have &s;ome talk fir&s;t with the Hartleys, with whom, as well as with me, he declared he would be upon honour.</P>

<P>I HAD a me&s;&s;age from Sir John la&s;t night, reque&s;t|ing me to dine with him and the elder Mr. Keeling this day; and to bring with me the two Mr. Hart|leys, and the proofs I had hinted at.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e gentlemen were &s;o obliging, as to go with me; and took the important paper with them, which had been depo&s;ited with their grandfather, as a com|mon friend, and contained a recognition of the Mans|fields right to the e&s;tates in que&s;tion, upon an ami|cable reference to per&s;ons long &s;ince departed: An at|te&s;ted copy of which was once in the Mansfields po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, as by a memorandum that came to hand, but which never could be found. The younger Keeling was not intended to be there; but he forced him&s;elf upon us. He behaved very rudely. I had once like to have forgot my&s;elf. This meeting produced no|thing: But as the father is a rea&s;onable man; as we have obtained a re-hearing of the cau&s;e; as he is much influenced by Sir John Lambton, who &s;eems convinced; and to who&s;e honour I have &s;ubmitted an ab&s;tract of our proofs; I am in hopes that we &s;hall be able to accommodate.</P>
<P>I have Bolton's propo&s;als before me. The fir&s;t child is dead; the &s;econd cannot live many months. He trembles at the proofs he knows we have of his villainy. He offers, on the death of this &s;econd child, to give us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, and a large &s;um of
<PB N="4" REF="5">
money (but thought not to be half of what the &s;uper|annuated Calvert left) if we will give him general relea&s;es. The wretch is not, we believe, married to the relict of Calvert.</P>
<P>I am loth, methinks, to let him e&s;cape the ju&s;tice which his crimes call for: But &s;uch are the delays and chicaneries of the law, when practi&s;ers are found who know how to perplex an hone&s;t pur&s;uer; and as we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to low and dirty people to e&s;tabli&s;h our proofs; the vile fellow &s;hall take with him the propo&s;ed &s;poils: They may not be much more than would be the lawyers part of the e&s;tate, were we to pu&s;h the litigation.</P>
<P>As to our poor Everard, nothing, I fear, can be done for him, with the men who are revelling on <HI>his</HI> &s;poils. I have &s;een one of them. The unhappy man has &s;igned and &s;ealed to his own ruin. He regrets, that a part of the e&s;tate which has been &s;o long in the family and name, &s;hould go out of it. What an empty pride is that of name! The general tenor of his life was not a credit to it; tho' he felt not that, till he felt di&s;tre&s;s. The di&s;grace is actually incurred. Does not all the world know his lo&s;s, and the win|ner's triumph? And if the world did not, can he con|ceal from him&s;elf tho&s;e vices, the con&s;equences of which have reduced him to what he is? But perhaps the unhappy man puts a value upon the name, in com|pliment to me.</P>
<P>Mention not to him what I write. The poor man is &s;en&s;ible enough of his folly, to engage pity: Whe|ther from a right &s;en&s;e, or not, mu&s;t be left to his own heart.</P>
<P>As to the woman's claim: What in honour can I do, again&s;t a promi&s;e that he owns may be proved upon him? He did not condition with her, that &s;he was to be a &s;potle&s;s woman. If he thought &s;he was &s;o when he &s;olicited her to yield to his de&s;ires, he is the le&s;s to be excu&s;ed: Vile as &s;he comes out to be,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
he had propo&s;ed to make her as vile, if he had found her not &s;o. He promi&s;ed her marriage: Meant he only a promi&s;e? <HI>She</HI> is puni&s;hed in being what &s;he <HI>is: His</HI> puni&s;hment cannot be condign, but by his being obliged to perform his promi&s;e. Yet I cannot bear to think that my cou&s;in Grandi&s;on &s;hould be made, for life, the dupe of a &s;ucce&s;sful and premeditated villainy; and the le&s;s, as, in all likelihood, the profligate Lord B. would continue to him&s;elf, from the merit with her of having vindicated her claim, an intere&s;t in the bad woman's favour, were &s;he to be the wife of our poor Everard.</P>
<P>But certainly this claim mu&s;t be pro&s;ecuted with a view only to extort money from my cou&s;in; and they know him to be of a family jealous of its honour. I think &s;he mu&s;t be treated with for relea&s;es. I could not bear to appear in &s;uch a cau&s;e as this, in open court, in &s;upport of my cou&s;in, again&s;t a promi&s;e made by him. He is of age, and thought to be no novice in the ways of the town. I am mi&s;taken in Mr. Grandi&s;on's &s;pirit, if it did not lead him to think him|&s;elf very &s;everely puni&s;hed, were he to have no other puni&s;hment, for tho&s;e vices, which were to be expen|&s;ive to <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>But if I &s;hould be able to extricate the unhappy man from this difficulty, what can next be done for him? The poor remains of his fortune will not &s;up|port one who has always lived <HI>more</HI> than genteelly. Will he be able, think you, to endure the thoughts of living in a con&s;tant &s;tate of dependence, however ea&s;y and genteel I &s;hould endeavour to make it to him? There may be many ways (in the public offices, for example) of providing for a broken trade&s;man: But for a man who calls him&s;elf, and is, a gentleman; who will expect as &s;uch to rank with his employer, who knows nothing of figures, or bu&s;ine&s;s of any kind; who has been brought up in idlene&s;s, and hardly knows the meaning of the word <HI>diligence;</HI> and never
<PB N="6" REF="7">
could bear confinement; what can be done for &s;uch a one in the public offices, or by any other employment that requires punctual attendance?</P>
<P>But to quit this &s;ubject, for a more agreeable one.</P>
<P>I have for &s;ome time had it in my thoughts to a&s;k you, my dear friend, Whether your nephew is pro|vided for to <HI>your</HI> liking and his <HI>own?</HI> If not, and he would put it in <HI>my</HI> power to &s;erve <HI>him,</HI> by &s;erving <HI>my|&s;elf,</HI> I &s;hould be obliged to <HI>you</HI> for permitting him &s;o to do, and to <HI>him,</HI> for his con&s;ent. I would not af|front him, by the offer of a &s;alary: My pre&s;ents to him &s;hall be &s;uch as befit the &s;ervices done:&mdash;Some|times as my amanuen&s;is; &s;ometimes as a tran&s;criber and methodizer of Papers and Letters; &s;ometimes in adju&s;ting &s;ervants accounts, and fitting them for my in&s;pection. You need not fear my regard to <HI>my&s;elf</HI> in my acknowlegements to be made to him (that, I know, will be all your fear); for I have always con|&s;idered profu&s;ion and par&s;imony as two extremes, e|qually to be avoided. You, my dear Dr. Bartlett, have often enforced this le&s;&s;on on my mind. Can it then ever be forgotten by</P>

<P>YOUR kind Letters from Lyons, my deare&s;t friend, rejoiced us extremely. Clementina lan|gui&s;hed to hear from you. How was it po&s;&s;ible for you to write with &s;o much warmth of affection to her, yet with &s;o much delicacy, that a rival could not take exceptions at it?</P>
<P>She writes to you. It is not for me, it is not for
<PB N="7" REF="8">
any of us, I think, to &s;ay one word to the principal &s;ubject of her Letter. She &s;hewed it to me, and to her mother, only.</P>
<P>Dear creature! Could &s;he be prevailed upon!&mdash;But how can you be a&s;ked to &s;upport the family-wi&s;hes? Yet if you think them ju&s;t, I know you will. You know not <HI>Self,</HI> when ju&s;tice and the &s;ervice of your friend &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to it. All that I am afraid of is, that we &s;hall be too precipitate for the dear creature's head.</P>
<P>Would to God, you could have been my Brother! That was the fir&s;t de&s;ire of my heart!&mdash;But you will &s;ee by her Letter (the lea&s;t flighty that &s;he has written of a long time) that &s;he has no thought of that: And &s;he declares to us, that &s;he wi&s;hes you happily married to an Engli&s;hwoman. Would to Heaven, we might plead <HI>your</HI> example to <HI>her!</HI></P>
<P>I will certainly attend you in your England!&mdash;If one thing, that we all wi&s;h, could happen, you would have the whole family, as far as I know. We think, we talk, of nobody but you. We look out for Eng|li&s;hmen, to do them honour for your &s;ake.</P>
<P>Mrs, Beaumont is with us. Surely &s;he is your near relation! She advi&s;es caution; but thinks that our pre&s;ent mea&s;ures are not wrong ones, as we never can give into my &s;i&s;ter's wi&s;hes to quit the world. Dear Grandi&s;on! love not Mrs. Beaumont the le&s;s for her opinion in our favour.</P>
<P>Mr. Lowther writes to you: I &s;ay nothing, there|fore, of that worthy man.</P>
<P>I am wi&s;hed to write more enforcingly to you, on a certain important &s;ubject: But I &s;ay, I cannot, dare not, will not.</P>
<P>Dear Grandi&s;on, love &s;till your Jeronymo! Your friend&s;hip makes life worthy of my wi&s;h. It has been a con&s;olation to me, when every other failed, and all around me was darkne&s;s, and the &s;hadow of death. You will often be troubled with Letters from

<P>HOW welcome to me was your Letter from Ly|ons! My good Chevalier Grandi&s;on, my heart thanks you for it: Yet it was po&s;&s;ible that heart could have been &s;till more thankful, had I not ob&s;erved in your Letter an air of pen&s;ivene&s;s, tho' it is endea|voured to be concealed. What pain would it give me to know, that you &s;uffer on my account!&mdash;But no more in this &s;train: A complaining one mu&s;t take place.</P>
<P>O Chevalier, I am per&s;ecuted! And by whom? By my deare&s;t, my neare&s;t friends. I was afraid it would be &s;o. Why, why, would you deny me your influence, when I importuned you for it? Why would you not &s;tay among us, till you &s;aw me pro|fe&s;&s;ed? Then had I been happy&mdash;In <HI>time,</HI> I &s;hould have been happy!&mdash;Now am I be&s;et with entreaties, with &s;upplications, from tho&s;e who ought to com|mand;&mdash;yet unlawfully, if they did: I pre&s;ume to think &s;o: Since parents, tho' they ought to be con|&s;ulted in the change of condition, as to the <HI>per&s;on;</HI> yet &s;urely &s;hould not oblige the child to marry, who choo&s;es to be &s;ingle all her life. A more cogent rea|&s;on may be pleaded, and I do plead it to my relations, as Catholics, as I wi&s;h for nothing &s;o much as to a&s;|&s;ume the veil.&mdash;But you are a Prote&s;tant: You favour not a Divine dedication, and would not plead for me. On the contrary, you have &s;trengthened their hands!&mdash;O Chevalier! how could you do &s;o, and ever love me! Did you not know, there was but one way to
<PB N="9" REF="10">
e&s;cape the grievous con&s;equences of the importunities of tho&s;e who ju&s;tly lay claim to my obedience?&mdash;And they <HI>do</HI> claim it.</P>
<P>And in what forcible manner, claim it!&mdash;Shall I tell you? Thus, then: My father, with tears in his eyes, be&s;eeches me! My mother gently reminds me of what &s;he has &s;uffered for me in my illne&s;s; and declares, that it is in my power to make the re&s;t of her days happy: Nor &s;hall &s;he think my own tranquility of mind &s;ecured, &punc;till I oblige her!&mdash;O Chevalier! what pleas are the&s;e from a father, who&s;e eyes plead more &s;trongly than words: and from a mother, on who&s;e bright days I ca&s;t a cloud!&mdash;The Bi&s;hop pleads: How can a Catholic Bi&s;hop plead, and not for me? The General declares, that he never wooed his beloved wife for her con&s;ent with more fervour than he does me for mine, to oblige them all. Nay, Jeronymo! Blu&s;h, &s;i&s;terly love! to &s;ay it&mdash;Jeronymo, your friend Jero|nymo, is &s;olicitous on the &s;ame &s;ide&mdash;Even Father Mare&s;cotti is carried away by the example of the Bi|&s;hop.&mdash;Mrs. Beaumont argues with me in their fa|vour.&mdash;And Camilla, who was ever full of your prai&s;es, teazes me continually.</P>
<P>They name not the man: They pretend to leave me free to choo&s;e through the world. They plead, that, zealous as they are in the Catholic faith, they were <HI>&s;o</HI> earne&s;t for me to enter into the &s;tate, that they were de&s;irous to &s;ee me the wife even of a Pro|te&s;tant, rather than I &s;hould remain &s;ingle: And they remind me, that it was owing to my &s;cruple only, that this was not effected.&mdash;But why, why will they weaken rather than &s;trengthen my &s;cruple? Could I have got over three points&mdash;The &s;en&s;e of my own unworthine&s;s, after my mind had been di&s;turbed; The <HI>in&s;uperable</HI> apprehen&s;ion, that, drawn a&s;ide by your Love, I &s;hould probably have en&s;nared my own Soul: and that I &s;hould be perpetually lamenting the certainty of the lo&s;s of his whom it would be my
<PB N="10" REF="11">
duty to love as my own; their importunity would hardly have been wanted.</P>
<P>Tell me advi&s;e me, my good Chevalier, my fourth brother (You are not Now <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> in the debate) if I may not lawfully &s;tand out? Tell me, as I know that I cannot an&s;wer their views, except I marry, and yet cannot con&s;ent to marry, whether I may not as well &s;eque&s;ter my&s;elf from the world, and in&s;i&s;t upon &s;o doing?</P>
<P>What, what can I do?&mdash;I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed&mdash;O thou, my <HI>Brother,</HI> my Friend, whom my heart ever mu&s;t hold dear, advi&s;e me! To you I have told them I will appeal. They are &s;o good as to promi&s;e to &s;u&s;pend their &s;olicitations, if I will hold &s;u&s;pended my thoughts of the veil till I have your advice.&mdash;But give it not again&s;t me&mdash;If you ever valued Clementina,</P>

<P>WHAT can I &s;ay, mo&s;t excellent of women, to the contents of the Lerter you have honoured me with? What a ta&s;k have you impo&s;ed upon me! You take great, and, re&s;pecting your intentions, I will call it, <HI>kind</HI> care, to let me know that I can have no intere&s;t in the deci&s;ion of the ca&s;e you refer to me. I repeat my humble acquie&s;cence; but mu&s;t again de|clare, that it would have been next to impo&s;&s;ible to do &s;o, had you not made a point of con&s;cience of your &s;cruples.</P>
<P>But what weight is my advice likely to have with a young Lady, who repeatedly, in the clo&s;e of her Let|ter, de&s;ires me not to give it <HI>for</HI> her parents?</P>
<P>I, madam, am <HI>far</HI> from being unprejudiced in this ca&s;e. For can the man who once him&s;elf hoped for
<PB N="11" REF="12">
the honour of your hand, advi&s;e you again&s;t Marri|age?&mdash;Are not your parents generou&s;ly indulgent, when they name not any particular per&s;on to you? I applaud both their wi&s;dom and their goodne&s;s, on this occa&s;ion. Po&s;&s;ibly, you <HI>gue&s;s</HI> the man whom they would recommend to your choice: And I am &s;ure, Lady Clementina would not refu&s;e their recommen|dation merely becau&s;e it was <HI>theirs.</HI> Nor indeed upon any le&s;s rea&s;on than an unconquerable aver&s;ion, or a preference to &s;ome other Catholic. A Prote&s;tant, it &s;eems, it <HI>cannot</HI> be.</P>
<P>But let me a&s;k my Si&s;ter, my Friend, What an&s;wer can I return to the Lady who had &s;hewn, in one in|&s;tance, that &s;he had not an in&s;uperable aver&s;ion to Matrimony; yet on con&s;cientious rea&s;ons refu&s;ing one man, and not particularly favouring any, can &s;cruple to oblige <HI>(obey</HI> is not the word they u&s;e) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'a Father, who with tears in his eyes be&s;eeches her; a Mother who gently reminds her of what &s;he has &s;uffered for her; who declares, that it is in her power to make the re&s;t of her days happy; and who urges a &s;till &s;tronger plea re&s;pecting them both, and the whole family, to engage the attention of the beloved daughter?"&mdash;O madam, what pleas are tho&s;e (Let me &s;till make u&s;e of your own pathetic words) from a Father who&s;e eyes plead more &s;trongly than words! and from a Mother, over who&s;e bright days you had (tho' involuntarily) ca&s;t a cloud!&mdash;Your Brother the Bi&s;hop, a man of piety; your Con|f&s;&s;or, a man of equal piety; your two other Bro|thers, your di&s;intere&s;ted Friend Mrs. Beaumont; your faithful Camilla; all wholly di&s;intere&s;ted.'</Q>&mdash;What an enumeration again&s;t your&s;elf.&mdash;Forbidden, as I am. to give the cau&s;e <HI>again&s;t</HI> you, what can I &s;ay? Deare&s;t Lady Clementina, can I, on your own repre&s;entation, give it <HI>for</HI> you?</P>
<P>You know, madam, the &s;acrifice I have made to the plea of <HI>your</HI> con&s;cience, not <HI>my</HI> own. I make
<PB N="12" REF="13">
no doubt, but parents &s;o indulgent as yours, will yield to your rea&s;ons, if you can plead <HI>con&s;cience</HI> again&s;t the performance of the <HI>filial duty;</HI> the more a duty, as it is &s;o gently urged: Nay, hardly urged; but by tears, and wi&s;hes, which the eyes, not the lips, expre&s;s; and which if you will perform, your parents will think them&s;elves under an obligation to their child.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina is one of the mo&s;t generous of wo|men: But con&s;ider, madam, in this in&s;tance of prefer|ing your own will to that of the mo&s;t indulgent of pa|rents, whether there is not an apparent &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, incon|&s;i&s;tent with your general character, even were you to be as happy in a convent, as you propo&s;e. Would you not, in that ca&s;e, live to your&s;elf, and renounce your parents and family, as parts of that world which you would vow to de&s;pi&s;e?&mdash;Dear Lady! I asked you once before, Is there any thing &s;inful in a Sacrament? Such all good Catholics deem Matrimony. And &s;hall I ask you, Whether, as &s;elf-denial is held to be meri|torious in your church, there is not a merit in denying your&s;elf in the ca&s;e before us, when you can, by per|forming the filial duty, oblige your whole family?</P>
<P>Permit me to &s;ay, that tho' a Prote&s;tant, I am not an enemy to &s;uch foundations in general. I could wi&s;h, under proper regulations, that we had Nunne|neries among us. I would not, indeed, have the obli|gation upon Nuns be perpetual: Let them have liber|ty, at the end of every two or three years, to renew their vows, or otherwi&s;e, by the con&s;ent of friends. Celibacy in the Clergy is an indi&s;pen&s;able law of your church: Yet a Cardinal has been allowed to lay down the purple, and marry. You know, madam, I mu&s;t mean Ferdinand of Medicis. Family-rea&s;ons, in that ca&s;e, preponderated, as well at Rome, as at Florence.</P>
<P>Of all the women I know, Lady Clementina della Porretta &s;hould be the la&s;t who &s;hould be earne&s;t to take the veil. There can be but two per&s;ons in the world, be&s;ides her&s;elf, who will not be grieved at her
<PB N="13" REF="14">
choice. We know <HI>their</HI> rea&s;ons. The will of her grandfathers, now with God, is again&s;t her; and her living parents, and every other per&s;on of her family, tho&s;e <HI>two</HI> excepted, would be made unhappy, if &s;he &s;eque&s;tered her&s;elf from the world, and them. Cle|mentina has charity: She wi&s;hes, &s;he once &s;aid, to take a great revenge upon Laurana. Laurana has &s;omething to repent of: Let <HI>her</HI> take the veil. The fondne&s;s &s;he has for the world, a fondne&s;s which could make her break through all the ties of relation, and humanity, requires a check: But are any of tho&s;e in convents more pious, more exemplary pious, than Clementina is, out of them?</P>
<P>Much more could I urge on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion; but what I have urged has been a <HI>ta&s;k</HI> upon me; a ta&s;k which I could not have performed, had I not preferred to my own, the happine&s;s of you and your family.</P>
<P>May both earthly and heavenly ble&s;&s;ings attend your determination, whatever it be, prays, deare&s;t madam.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>Sat. Sept. <HI>18-29.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have written, my beloved friend, to Lady Clemen|tina; and &s;hall inclo&s;e a copy of my Letter.</P>
<P>I own, that, till I received hers, I thought there was a po&s;&s;ibility, tho' not a probability, that &s;he might change her mind in my favour. I <HI>fore&s;aw</HI> that you would all join, for family-rea&s;ons, to pre&s;s her to
<PB N="14" REF="15">
marry: And when, thought I, &s;he finds her&s;elf very earne&s;tly urged, it is po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he will forego her &s;cruples, and, propo&s;ing &s;ome conditions for her&s;elf, will honour with her hand the man whom &s;he has avowedly honoured with a place in her heart, rather than any other. The malady &s;he has been afflicted with, often leaves, for &s;ome time, an un&s;teadine&s;s in the mind: My ab&s;ence, as I propo&s;ed to &s;ettle in my native country, never more, perhaps, to return to Italy; the high notions &s;he has of obligation and gra|titude; her declared confidence in my honour and affection; all co-operating, &s;he may, thought I, change her mind; and if &s;he does, I cannot doubt the favour of her friends. It was not, my Jeronymo, pre|&s;umptuous to <HI>hope.</HI> It was <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to Clementina to attend the event, and to wait for the promi&s;ed Letter: But now, that I &s;ee you are all of one mind, and that the dear Lady, tho' vehemently urged by all her friends to marry &s;ome other man, can appeal to me, only as to her <HI>fourth Brother,</HI> and a man <HI>not intere&s;ted</HI> in the event&mdash;I give up all my hopes.</P>
<P>I have written accordingly to your dear Clementi|na; but it could not be expected, that I &s;hould give the argument all the weight that might be given it: Yet, being of opinion that &s;he was in duty obliged to yield to the entreaties of all her friends, I have been hone&s;t. But &s;urely no man ever was involved in &s;o many difficult &s;ituations as your Grandi&s;on; who yet never, by enterprize or ra&s;hne&s;s, was led out of the plain path into difficulties &s;o uncommon.</P>
<P>You wi&s;h, my dear friend, that I would &s;et an ex|ample to your excellent &s;i&s;ter. I will unbo&s;om my heart to you.</P>
<P>There is a Lady, an Engli&s;h Lady, beautiful as an Angel, but who&s;e beauty is her lea&s;t perfection, either in my eyes, or her own: Had I never known Cle|mentina, I could not have loved her, and <HI>only</HI> her, of all the women I ever beheld. It would not be doing her
<PB N="15" REF="16">
ju&s;tice, if I could not &s;ay, I <HI>do</HI> love her; but with a flame as pure as the heart of Clementina, or as her own heart, can boa&s;t. Clementina's di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mind af|fected me: I imputed her &s;ufferings to her e&s;teem for me. The farewel interview denied her, &s;he demon&s;|trated, I thought, &s;o firm an affection for me, at the &s;ame time that &s;he was to me, what I may truly call, a fir&s;t Love; that, tho&punc; the difficulties in my way &s;eemed in|&s;uperable. I thought it became me, in honour, in gratitude, to hold my&s;elf in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and not offer to make my addre&s;&s;es to any other woman, till the de&s;|tiny of the dear Clementina was determined.</P>
<P>It would look like vanity in me to tell my Jerony|mo how many propo&s;als, from the partial friends of women of rank and merit &s;uperior to my own, I thought my&s;elf obliged, in honour to the Ladies them|&s;elves, to decline: But my heart never &s;uffered unea|&s;ine&s;s from the uncertainty I was in of ever &s;ucceeding with your beloved &s;i&s;ter, but on this Lady's account, I pre&s;ume not, however, to &s;ay, I could have &s;ucceed|ed, had I thought my&s;elf at liberty to make my ad|dre&s;&s;es to her: Yet, when I &s;uffered my&s;elf to balance, becau&s;e of my uncertainty with your Clementina, I had hopes, from the intere&s;t my two &s;i&s;ters had with her (her affections di&s;engaged), that, had I been at li|berty to make my addre&s;&s;es to her, I might.</P>
<P>Shall I, my dear Jeronymo, own the truth?&mdash;The two noble&s;t-minded women in the world, when I went over to Italy, on the invitation of my Lord the Bi&s;hop, held almo&s;t an equal intere&s;t in my heart; and I was thereby enabled ju&s;tly, and with the greater command of my&s;elf, to declare to the Marchione&s;s, and the General, at my la&s;t going over, that I held my&s;elf bound to you; but that your &s;i&s;ter, and you all, were free. But when the dear Clementina began to &s;hew &s;igns of recovery, and &s;eemed to confirm the hopes I had of her partiality to me; and my gratitude and attachment &s;eemed of importance to her complete
<PB N="16" REF="17">
re&s;toration; then, my Jeronymo, did I content my|&s;elf with wi&s;hing another husband to the Engli&s;h Lady, more worthy of her than my embara&s;&s;ed &s;ituati|on could have made me. And when I farther expe|rienced the conde&s;cending goodne&s;s of your whole fa|mily, all united in my favour; I had not a wi&s;h but for your Clementina.</P>
<P>What a di&s;appointment, my Jeronymo, was her rejection of me! obliged, as I was, to admire the noble Lady the more for her <HI>motives</HI> of rejecting me.</P>
<P>And now, my dear friend, what is your wi&s;h?&mdash;That I &s;hall &s;et your &s;i&s;ter an example? How can I? Is marriage in my power? There is but one woman in the world, now your dear Clementina has refu&s;ed me, that I can think worthy of &s;ucceeding <HI>her</HI> in my affec|tions, tho' there are thou&s;ands of whom I am not worthy. And ought that Lady to accept of a man who&s;e heart had been another's, and that other living, and &s;ingle, and &s;till honouring him with &s;o much of her regard, as may be thought &s;ufficient to attach a grateful heart, and occa&s;ion a divided Love? Cle|mentina her&s;elf is not more truly delicate than this Lady. Indeed, Jeronymo, I am ready, when I con|template my &s;ituation, on a &s;uppo&s;ition of making my addre&s;&s;es to her, to give up my&s;elf, as the unworthie&s;t of her favour of all the men I know; and &s;he has for an admirer almo&s;t every man who &s;ees her&mdash;Even Olivia admires her! Can I do ju&s;tice to the merits of both, and yet not <HI>appear</HI> to be divided by a double Love?&mdash;For I will own to all the world, my affection for Clementina; and, as once it was encouraged by her whole family, glory in it.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my Jeronymo, how I am circum&s;tanced. The example, I fear, mu&s;t come from Italy; not from England. Yet &s;ay I not this for punctilio-&s;ake: It is not in my <HI>power</HI> to &s;et it, as it is in your Cle|mentina's: It would be pre&s;umption to &s;uppo&s;e it is, Clementina has not an aver&s;ion to the <HI>&s;tate:</HI> She
<PB N="17" REF="18">
cannot to the man you have in view, &s;ince prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on in favour of another is over&mdash;This is a hard pu&s;h upon me. I pre&s;ume not to &s;ay what Clementina <HI>will,</HI> what &s;he <HI>can</HI> do: But &s;he is naturally the mo&s;t dutiful of children, and has a high &s;en&s;e of the more than common obligations &s;he owes to parents, to brothers, to whom &s;he has as unhappily as involuntarily given great di&s;tre&s;s: Difference in Religion, the motive of her rejecting <HI>me,</HI> is not in the que&s;tion: Filial duty is an article of Religion.</P>
<P>I do my&s;elf the honour of writing to the Mar|chione&s;s, to the General, to Father Mare&s;cotti, and to Mr. Lowther. May the Almighty perfect your re|covery, my Jeronymo; and pre&s;erve in health and &s;pi|rits the dear Clementina!&mdash;and may every other laudable wi&s;h of the hearts of a family &s;o truly-excel|lent, be granted to them!&mdash;prays, my deare&s;t Jerony|mo, the friend who expects to &s;ee you in England; the friend who loves you, as he loves his own heart; and equally honours all of your name; and <HI>will,</HI> &s;o long as he is</P>

<P>O My dear cou&s;in! I am now &s;ure you will be the happie&s;t of women! Sir Charles Grandi&s;on made us a vi&s;it this very day.&mdash;How Mr. Reeves and I rejoiced to &s;ee him! We had but ju&s;t before been called upon by a line from Lady G. to rejoice with her on her brother's happy arrival. He &s;aid, he was under obligation to go to Wind&s;or and Hamp&s;hire, upon extraordinary occa&s;ions; but he could not go, till he had paid his re&s;pects to us, as well for our own &s;akes, as to enquire after your health. He had re|ceived,
<PB N="18" REF="19">
he &s;aid, &s;ome di&s;agreeable inimitations in re|lation to it. We told him, you were not well; but we hoped not dangerou&s;ly ill. He &s;aid &s;o many kind, tender, yet re&s;pectful things of you&mdash;O my Harriet! I am &s;ure, and &s;o is Mr. Reeves, he loves you dearly. Yet we both wondered that he did not talk of paying you a vi&s;it. But he may have great matters in hand.&mdash;But what matters can be &s;o great as not to be po&s;t|poned, if he loves you?&mdash;and that he certainly does. I &s;hould not have known how to contain my joy be|fore him, had he declared him&s;elf your Lover.</P>
<P>He conde&s;cendingly asked to &s;ee my little boy&mdash;Was not that very good of him? He would have won my heart by this conde&s;cen&s;ion, had he not had a great &s;hare of it before&mdash;For your &s;ake, my cou&s;in. You know I cannot mean otherwi&s;e: And you know, that, except Mr. Reeves and my little boy, I love my Harriet better than any-body in the world. No-body in Northampton&s;hire, I am &s;ure, will take excepti|ons at this.</P>
<P>I thought I would write to you of this kind vi&s;it. Be well, now, my dear: All things, I am &s;ure, will come abou for good: God grant they may!&mdash;I dare &s;ay, he will vi&s;it you in Northampton&s;hire: And if he does, what can be his motive? <HI>Not</HI> mere friend&s;hip: Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is no tri&s;ler!</P>
<P>I know you will be &s;orry to hear that Lady Betty Williams is in great affliction. Mi&s;s Williams has run away with en&s;ign who is not worth a &s;hilling: He is, on the contrary, <HI>over head and cars,</HI> as the &s;aying is, in debt. Such a mere girl! But what &s;hall we &s;ay?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cantillon has made as fooli&s;h a &s;tep. Lord ble&s;s me! I think girls, in the&s;e days, are bewitched. A nominal captain too: Her mother vows, they &s;hall both &s;tarve for her: And they have no other depend|ence. She can't live without her plea&s;ures: Neither can he without his. A Ranelagh &s;op. Poor wretches!

What will become of them? For every-thing is in her mother's power, as to fortune.&mdash;She has been met by Mi&s;s Alle&s;tree: and looked <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;hy! <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;illy! <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;latternly! Unhappy coquetti&s;h thing!</P>
<P>Well, but God ble&s;s you, my dear!&mdash;My nur&s;ery calls upon me: The dear little &s;oul is &s;o <HI>fond</HI> of me! Adieu. Compliments to every-body I have &s;o much rea&s;on to love: Mr. Reeves's too. Once more, Adieu.</P>

<P>But time will &s;oon determine my de&s;tiny: I will have patience to wait its determination. I make no doubt but he has &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for all he does.</P>
<P>I am as much delighted, as you could be, at the notice he took of your dear infant. The brave mu&s;t be humane: And what greater in&s;tance of humanity can be &s;hewn, than for grown per&s;ons to look back upon the &s;tate they were once them&s;elves in, with tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion?</P>

<P>DO you know what is become of your brother? My grandmamma Shirely has &s;een his Gho&s;t; and talked with it near an hour; and then it vani&s;hed. Be not &s;urprized, my dear creature. I am &s;till in amaze at the account my grandmamma gives us of its appearance, di&s;cour&s;e, and vani&s;hing! Nor was the dear parent in a re&s;verie. It happened in the middle of the afternoon, all in broad day. Thus &s;he tells it:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I was &s;itting, &s;aid &s;he, in my own drawing|room, ye&s;terday, by my&s;elf; when, in came James, to whom it fir&s;t appeared, and told me that a gen|tleman de&s;ired to be introduced to me. I was read|ing <HI>Sherlock upon Death,</HI> with that chearfulne&s;s with which I always meditate the &s;ubject. I gave orders for his admittance; and in came, to appearance, one of the hand&s;ome&s;t men I ever &s;aw in my life, in a riding-dre&s;s. It was a courteous Gho&s;t: It &s;a|luted me; or at lea&s;t I thought it did: For it an|&s;wering to the de&s;cription that you, my Harriet, had given me of that amiable man, I was &s;urpri&s;ed. But, contrary to the manner of gho&s;ts, it &s;poke fir&s;t&mdash;Venerable Lady, it called me; and &s;aid, its name was Grandi&s;on, in a voice&mdash;&s;o like what I had heard you &s;pake of it, that I had no doubt but it was Sir Charles Grandi&s;on him&s;elf; and was ready to fall down to welcome him.</Q></P>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It took its place by me: You, madam, &s;aid it, will forgive this intru&s;ion: And it made &s;everal fine &s;peeches, with an air <HI>&s;o</HI> mode&s;t, <HI>&s;o</HI> manly&mdash;It had almo&s;t all the talk to it&s;elf. I could only bow, and
<PB N="22" REF="23">
be plea&s;ed; for &s;till I thought it was corporally, and indeed, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. It &s;aid, that it had but a very little while to &s;tay: It mu&s;t reach, I don't know what place, that night&mdash;What, &s;aid I, will you not go to Selby-hou&s;e? Will you not &s;ee my daughter Byron? Will you not &s;ee her aunt Selby? No, it de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. It talked of leaving a pacquet behind it; and &s;eemed to pull out of its pocket a parcel of Letters &s;ealed up. It broke the &s;eal, and laid the parcel on the table before me. It refu&s;ed refre&s;hment. It de&s;ired in a courtly man|ner, an an&s;wer to what it had di&s;cour&s;ed upon&mdash;Made a profound reverence&mdash;and&mdash;vani&s;hed.'</Q>
<P>And now, my dear Lady G. let me repeat my que&s;tion; What is become of your brother?</P>
<P>Forgive me, this light, this amu&s;ing manner. My grandmamma &s;peaks of this vi&s;it as an appearance, &s;o &s;udden, and &s;o &s;hort, and nobody &s;eeing him but &s;he; that it gave a kind of amu&s;ing levity to my pen, and I could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation I was under to &s;ur|pri&s;e you, as he has done us all. How could he take &s;uch a journey, &s;ee nobody but my grandmamma, and fly the country? Did he do it to &s;pare us, or to &s;pare him&s;elf?</P>
<P>The direct truth is this: My grandmamma was &s;it|ting by her&s;elf, as above: James told her, as above, that a gentleman de&s;ired to be introduced to her. He <HI>was</HI> introduced. He called him&s;elf by his own name; took her hand; &s;aluted her&mdash;Your character, madam, and mine, &s;aid he, are &s;o well known to each other, that tho' I never before had the honour of approaching you, I may pre&s;ume upon your pardon for this in|tru&s;ion.</P>
<P>He then launched out in the prai&s;es of your happy friend. With what delight did the dear, the indul|gent parent repeat them from his mouth! I hope &s;he mingled not her own partialities with them, whether I de&s;erved them, or not; for &s;weet is prai&s;e, from
<PB N="23" REF="24">
tho&s;e we wi&s;h to love us. And then he &s;aid, You &s;ee before you, madam, a man glorying in his affection to one of the mo&s;t excellent of your Sex; an Italian Lady; the pride of Italy! And who, from motives which cannot be with&s;tood, has rejected him, at the very time that all her friends con&s;enting, and innu|merable difficulties overcome, he expected that &s;he would yield her hand to his wi&s;hes&mdash;And they <HI>were</HI> his wi&s;hes. My <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> for the dear Mi&s;s Byron <HI>(You</HI> and <HI>&s;he</HI> mu&s;t <HI>authorize</HI> me to call it by a &s;till dearer name, before I dare to it) is well known: That al&s;o has been my pride. I know too well what belongs to female delicacy in general, and particularly to that of Mi&s;s Byron, to addre&s;s my&s;elf fir&s;t to her, on the &s;ubject which occa&s;ions you this trouble. I am not accu&s;tomed to make profe&s;&s;ions, not even to La|dies&mdash;Is it con&s;i&s;tent with your notions of delicacy, madam; Will it be with Mr. and Mrs. Selby's; to give your intere&s;t in favour of a man who is thus &s;itu|ated? A rejected man! A man who dares, to own, that the rejection was a di&s;appointment to him; and that he tenderly loved the fair rejecter. If it will, and Mi&s;s Byron can accept the tender of a heart that has been divided, unaccountably &s;o (the circum&s;tances, I pre&s;ume, you know) then will <HI>you,</HI> then will <HI>&s;he,</HI> lay me under an obligation that I can only <HI>endeavour</HI> to repay by the utmo&s;t gratitude and affection.&mdash;But if not, I &s;hall admire the delicacy of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> refu&s;er, as I do the piety of the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and, at <HI>lea&s;t, &s;u&s;pend</HI> all thoughts of a change of condition.</P>
<P>Noble&s;t of men&mdash;And my grandmamma was pro|ceeding in high &s;trains, but very &s;incere ones; when, interrupting her, and pulling out of his pocket the pacquet I mentioned above; I pre&s;ume, madam, &s;aid he, that I &s;ee favour and goodne&s;s to me in your be|nign countenance: But I will not even be <HI>favoured,</HI> but upon your full knowledge of all the facts I am ma&s;ter of my&s;elf. I will be the guardian of the deli|cacy
<PB N="24" REF="25">
of Mi&s;s Byron and all her friends in this im|portant ca&s;e, rather than the di&s;courager, tho' I were to &s;uffer by it. You will be &s;o good as to read the&s;e Letters to your daughter Byron, to her Lucy, to Mr. and Mrs. Selby, and to whom el&s;e you will think fit to call to the con&s;ultation: They will be tho&s;e, I pre|&s;ume, who already know &s;omething of the hi&s;tory of the excellent Clementina. If, on the peru&s;al of them, I may be admitted to pay my re&s;pects to Mi&s;s Byron, con&s;i&s;tently, as I hinted, with <HI>her</HI> notions and <HI>yours</HI> of that delicacy by which &s;he was always directed, and at the &s;ame time be received with that noble frank|ne&s;s which has di&s;tingui&s;hed her in my eye above all women but one (Excu&s;e me, madam, I mu&s;t always put the&s;e &s;i&s;ter-&s;ouls upon an equal foot of excellence); then &s;hall I be a happier man than the happie&s;t. Your an&s;wer, madam, by pen and ink, will greatly oblige me; and the more, the &s;ooner I can be favoured with it; becau&s;e, being reque&s;ted by my friends abroad to &s;et an example to their beloved Clementina, as you will &s;ee in more than one of the&s;e Letters; I would avoid all punctilio, and let them know, that I had offered my&s;elf to Mi&s;s Byron, and have not been mor|tified with ab&s;olute denial; if I may be &s;o happy as to be allowed to write &s;o.</P>
<P>Thus did this mo&s;t generous of men prevent, by this reference to the Letters, my grandmamma's heart overflowing to her lips. He &s;hould directly, he &s;aid, proceed on his journey to London; and was in &s;uch ha&s;te to be gone, when he had &s;aid what he had to &s;ay, that it precipitated a little my grandmamma's &s;pirits: But the joy &s;he was filled with, on the occa&s;ion, was &s;o great, that &s;he only had a concern upon her, when he was gone, as if &s;omething was left by her undone or un&s;aid, which &s;he thought &s;hould have been &s;aid and done to oblige him.</P>
<P>The Letters he left on the table, were copies of what he wrote from Lyons to the Marquis and Mar|chione&s;s,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
the Bi&s;hop, the General, and Father Mare|&s;cotti; as al&s;o to Lady Ciementina, and her brother, the good Jeronymo <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Letters are omitted in this collection.</NOTE>. That to the Lady cannot be enough admired, for the tenderne&s;s, yet for the ac|quie&s;cence with her will expre&s;&s;ed in it. Surely they were born for each other, however it happens, that they are not likely to come together.</P>
<P>A Letter from Signor Jeronymo, in an&s;wer to his from Lyons, I will mention next. In this&mdash;Sir Charles is wi&s;hed to u&s;e his &s;uppo&s;ed influence upon Lady Clementina (What a hard ta&s;k upon him! (to di&s;&s;uade her from the thoughts of going into a nunnery and to re&s;olve upon marriage <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Letter ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next is a Letter of Lady Clementina to Sir Charles, complaining tenderly of per&s;ecution from her friends, who pre&s;s her to marry; while &s;he contends to be al|lowed to take the veil, and applies to Sir Charles for his intere&s;t in her behalf.</P>
<P>The next is Sir Charles's reply to Lady Clementina.</P>
<P>Then follows a Letter from Sir Charles to Signor Jeronymo. I have copied the&s;e three la&s;t, and inclo&s;e them in confidence <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See Letters iii iv. v.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By the&s;e you will &s;ee, my dear, that the affair be|tween this excellent man and woman is entirely given up by both; and al&s;o in his reply to Signor Jero|nymo, that your Harriet is referred to as his next choice. And how can I ever enough value him, for the dignity he has given me, in putting it, as it &s;hould &s;eem, in my power to lay an obligation upon him; in making for me my own &s;cruples; and now, la&s;tly, in the method he has taken in the application to my grandmamma, in&s;tead of to me; and leaving all to our determination. But thus &s;hould the men give dignity, even for their own &s;aken to the women whom they wi&s;h to be theirs. Were there more Sir Charles Grandi&s;ons, would not even the Female world
<PB N="26" REF="27">
(much better, as I hope it is, than the Male) be amended?</P>
<P>My grandmamma, the moment Sir Charles was gone, &s;ent to us, that &s;he had &s;ome very agreeable news to &s;urpri&s;e us with; and therefore de&s;ired the whole family of us, her Byron particularly to attend her at Breakfa&s;t, the next morning. We looked upon one another, at the me&s;&s;age, and wondered. I was not well, and would have excu&s;ed my&s;elf; but my aunt in&s;i&s;ted upon my going. Little did I or any-body el&s;e think of your brother having vi&s;ited my grand|mamma in per&s;on. When &s;he acquainted us that he had, my weakened &s;pirits wanted &s;upport: I was ob|liged to withdraw with Lucy.</P>
<P>I thought I could not bear, when I recovered my|&s;elf, that he &s;hould be &s;o near, and not <HI>once</HI> call in, and enquire after the health of the creature for whom he profe&s;&s;ed &s;o high an e&s;teem, and even affection: But when, on my return to company, my grand|mamma related what pa&s;&s;ed between them, and the Letters were read; then again were my failing &s;pirits unable to &s;upport me. They all gazed upon me, as the Letters were reading, as well as while my grand|mamma was giving the relation of what he &s;aid, and of the noble, the manly air with which he delivered him&s;elf.&mdash;With joy and &s;ilent congratulation they gazed upon me; while I felt &s;uch a variety of &s;en&s;i|bilities in my heart, as I never felt before, &s;en&s;ibi|lities mixed with wonder; and I was &s;ometimes ready to doubt whether I were not in a re&s;verie; whether indeed I was in this world, or another; whether I was Harriet Byron&mdash;I know not how to de&s;cribe what I felt in my now fluttering, now rejoicing, now deject|ed heart&mdash;</P>
<P>Dejected?&mdash;Yes, my dear Lady G. Dejection was a &s;trong ingredient in my &s;en&s;ibilities. I know not why. Yet may there not be a fulne&s;s in joy, that will mingle di&s;&s;atisfaction with it? If there may, &s;hall I
<PB N="27" REF="28">
be excu&s;ed for my &s;olemnity, if I deduce from thence an argument, that the human &s;oul is not to be fully &s;atisfied by worldly enjoyments; and that therefore the completion of its happine&s;s mu&s;t be in another, a more perfect &s;tate? You Lady G. are a very good woman, tho' a lively one; and I will not excu&s;e <HI>you,</HI> if on an occa&s;ion that bids me look forward to a very &s;olemn event, you will not forgive my <HI>&s;eriou&s;ne&s;</HI>&mdash;That <HI>bids me look forward,</HI> I repeat; for Sir Charles Grandi&s;on cannot alter his mind: The world has not wherewith to <HI>tempt</HI> him to alter it, after he has made <HI>&s;uch</HI> advances, except I mi&s;behave.</P>
<P>Well, my dear, and what was the re&s;ult of our conference?&mdash;My grandmamma, my aunt, and Lucy, were of opinion, that I ought no more to revolve the notions of a divided or &s;econd-placed Love: That every point of female delicacy was an&s;wered: That he ought not only <HI>&s;till</HI> to be allowed to love Lady Clementina, but that I and all her Sex &s;hould revere her: That my grandmamma, being the per&s;on ap|plied to, &s;hould an&s;wer for me, for us all, in words of her own choo&s;ing.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent. What think <HI>you,</HI> my dear, &s;aid my aunt? with her accu&s;tomed tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Think! &s;aid my uncle, with his u&s;ual facetiou&s;ne&s;s; Do you think, if Harriet had <HI>one</HI> objection, &s;he would have been &s;ilent? I am for &s;ending up for Sir Charles out of hand. Let him come the fir&s;t day of next week, and let them be married before the end of it.</P>
<P>Not <HI>quite</HI> &s;o ha&s;ty, neither, Mr. Selby, &s;aid my grandmamma, &s;miling: Let us &s;end to Mr. Deane. His love for my child, and regard for de&s;erve the mo&s;t grateful returns.</P>
<P>What a duce, and defer an an&s;wer to Sir Charles, who gives a generous rea&s;on, for the &s;ake of the Lady abroad, and her family (and I hope he thinks a little of his <HI>own</HI> &s;ake) for wi&s;hing a &s;peedy an&s;wer?&mdash;</P>
<P>No, Mr. Selby: Not de&s;er writing, neither. We
<PB N="28" REF="29">
know enough of Mr. Deane's mind already. But, for my part, I don't know what terms, what conditions, what additions to my child's fortune, to propo&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>Additions! madam&mdash;Why, ay; there mu&s;t be &s;ome, to be &s;ure&mdash;And we are able, and as willing as able, let me tell you, to make them&mdash;</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, Sir, &s;aid I&mdash;Pray, madam&mdash;No more of this&mdash;Surely it is time enough to talk of the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>So it is, niece. Mr. Deane is a lawyer. God help me! I never was brought up to any-thing but to live on the fat of the land, as the &s;aying is. Mr. Deane and Sir Charles &s;hall talk this matter over by them|&s;elves. Let us, as you &s;ay, &s;end for Mr. Deane. But I will my&s;elf be the me&s;&s;enger of the&s;e joyful tidings.</P>
<P>My uncle then tuned out, in his gay manner, a line of an old &s;ong; and then &s;aid, I'll go to Mr. Deane: I will &s;et out this very day&mdash;Pull down the wall, as one of our kings &s;aid; the door is too far about.&mdash;I'll bring Mr. Deane with me to-morrow, or it &s;hall co&s;t me a fall.</P>
<P>You know my uncle, my dear. In this manner did he expre&s;s his joy.</P>
<P>My grandmother retired to her clo&s;et; and this that follows is what &s;he wrote to Sir Charles. Every|body is plea&s;ed whenever &s;he takes up the pen. No one made objection to a &s;ingle word in it.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>RE&s;erve would be unpardonable on our &s;ide, tho' the woman's, to a man who is above re&s;erve, and who&s;e offers are the re&s;ult of deliberation, and an affection, that, being founded in the merit of our dear|e&s;t child, cannot be doubted. We all receive as an honour the offer you make us of an alliance which would do credit to families of the fir&s;t rank. It will perhaps be one day owned to you, that it was the height of Mr. Selby's wi&s;hes and mine, that the man

who had re&s;cued the dear createre from in&s;ult and di|&s;tre&s;s, might be at liberty to intitle him&s;elf to her grateful Love.</P>
<P>The noble manner in which you have explained your&s;elf on a &s;ubject which has greatly embarra&s;&s;ed you, has abundantly &s;atisfied Mrs. Selby, Lucy, and my&s;elf: We can have no &s;cruples of delicacy. Nor am I afraid of &s;uffering from yours by my frankne&s;s. But, as to our Harriet&mdash;You may perhaps meet with &s;ome (not affectation; &s;he is a ove it) difficulty with <HI>her,</HI> if you expect her <HI>whole</HI> heart to be yours. She, Sir, experimentally knows how to allow for a double, a divided Love&mdash;Dr. Bartlett, perhaps &s;hould not have favoured her with the character of a Lady whom &s;he prefers to her&s;elf; and Mrs. Selby and I have &s;ome|times, as we read her melancholy &s;tory, thought, not unju&s;tly. If &s;he can be induced to love, to honour, the man of her choice, as much as &s;he loves, honours, and admires Lady Clementina; the happy Man will have rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied. You &s;ee, Sir, that we, who were able to give a preference to the &s;ame Lady again&s;t our&s;elves (Harriet Byron <HI>is</HI> our&s;elf) can have no &s;cruples on <HI>your</HI> giving it to the &s;ame incompara|ble woman. May that Lady be happy! If &s;he were <HI>not</HI> to be &s;o, and her unhappine&s;s were to be owing to our happine&s;s; that, dear Sir, would be all that could pain the hearts of any of us, on an occa&s;ion &s;o very a|greeable to</P>

<P>EXcellent Mrs. Shirley! Incomparable woman! How I love her! If I were &s;uch an excellent an|cient, I would no more wi&s;h to be young, than &s;he has &s;o often told us, &s;he does. What my brother once &s;aid, and you once wrote to your Lucy, is true (in <HI>her</HI> ca&s;e, at lea&s;t); that the matronly and advanced time of life, in a woman, is far from being the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> elegible part of it; e&s;pecially, I may add, when health and a good con&s;cience accompany it. What a &s;pirit does &s;he, at her time of Life, write with!&mdash;But her heart is in her &s;ubject&mdash;I hope I may &s;ay <HI>that,</HI> Har|riet, without offending you.</P>
<P>Not a word did my brother &s;peak of his intention, till he received that Letter; and then he invited Lady L. and me, and our two hone&s;t men, to afternoon tea with him&mdash;[O but I have not reckoned with you for your &s;aucy rebukes in your la&s;t of the 7th; I owe you a &s;pite for it; and, Harriet, depend on payment&mdash;What was I writing?&mdash;I have it&mdash;] And when tea was over, he, without a blu&s;h, without looking down, as a girl would do in this &s;ituation&mdash;[But why &s;o, Har|riet? Is a woman, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, to act a part as if &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her&s;elf to be the greate&s;t gainer by
<PB N="31" REF="32">
matrimony; and therefore was a&s;hamed of con&s;enting to accept of an honourable offer? As if, in other words, &s;he was to be the &s;elf-denying receiver rather than conferrer of an obligation?&mdash;Lord, how we ram|bling-headed creatures break in upon our&s;elves!] with a good grace he told us of his intention to marry; of his apparition to Mrs. Shirley; of his &s;udden vani&s;h|ing; and all that&mdash;And then he produced Mrs. Shir|ley's Letter, but ju&s;t received.</P>
<P>And do you think we were not overjoyed?&mdash;Indeed we were. We congratulated him: We congratulated each other: Lord L. looked as he did when Caroline gave him his happy day: Lord G. could not keep his &s;eat: He was tip&s;y, poor man, with his joy: Aunt Nell prank'd her&s;elf, &s;troked her ribbands of pink and yellow, and chuckled and mumped for joy, that her nephew at la&s;t would not go out of Old England for a wife. She was <HI>mightily</HI> plea&s;ed too with Mrs. Shir|ley's Letter. It was ju&s;t &s;uch a one as &s;he her&s;elf would have written upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I po&s;ted afterward to Mrs Reeves, to &s;hew her, as you reque&s;ted, your Letter: And when we had read it, there was, Dear Madam, and, Dear Sir; and now this, and now that; and Thank God&mdash;three times in a breath; and we were cou&s;ins, and cou&s;ins, and cou&s;ins: And, O ble&s;&s;ed! And, O be joyful! And&mdash;Hail the day!&mdash;And, God grant it to be a &s;hort one!&mdash;And, How will Harriet an&s;wer to the que&s;tion? Will not her frankne&s;s be try'd? He de&s;pi&s;es affecta|tion: So he thinks does &s;he!&mdash;Good Sirs! and, O dears&mdash;How things are brought about!&mdash;O my Har|riet! you never heard or &s;aw &s;uch congratulations be|tween three go&s;&s;ips, as were between our two cou&s;in Reeves's and me: And not a little did the good wo|man pride her&s;elf in her <HI>progno&s;tics;</HI> for &s;he explained that matter to me.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett is at Grandi&s;on-hall, with our unhappy cou&s;in. How will the good man rejoice!</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">
Now you will a&s;k, What became of Emily?&mdash;</P>
<P>By the way, do you know that Mrs. O-Hara is turned <HI>Methodi&s;t?</HI> True as you are alive. And &s;he labours hard to convert her husband. Thank God &s;he is any-thing that is &s;erious! Tho&s;e People have really great merit with me, in <HI>her</HI> conver&s;ion.&mdash;I am &s;orry that our own Clergy are not as zealou&s;ly in ear|ne&s;t as they, They have really, my dear, if we may believe aunt Eleanor, given a face of religion to &s;ub|terranean colliers, tinners, and the mo&s;t profligate of men, who hardly ever before heard either of the word, or thing. But <HI>I</HI> am not turning <HI>Methodi&s;t,</HI> Harriet. No! you will not &s;u&s;pect me.</P>
<P>Now Emily, who is at pre&s;ent my vi&s;iter, had asked leave before my brother's invitation (and was gone, my Jenny attending her) to vi&s;it her mother, who is not well. My brother was engaged to &s;up abroad with &s;ome of the Danby's, I believe: I there|fore made Lord and Lady L. cou&s;in Reeves and cou&s;in Reeves, and my aunt Grandi&s;on, &s;up with me.</P>
<P>Emily was at home before me&mdash;Ah the poor Emi|ly!&mdash;I'll tell you how it was between us&mdash;</P>
<P>My lovely girl, my dear Emily, &s;aid I, I have good news to tell you, about Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>O thank God&mdash;And is &s;he well? Pray, madam, tell me, tell me; I long to hear good news of my dear Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>Why, &s;he will &s;hortly be married, Emily!&mdash;</P>
<P>Married, madam!&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, my love!&mdash;And to your guardian, child!&mdash;</P>
<P>To my guardian, madam!&mdash;Well, but I hope &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P>I then gave her a few particulars.</P>
<P>The dear girl tried to be joyful, and bur&s;t into tears!</P>
<P>Why weeps my girl&mdash;O fie! Are you &s;orry that Mi&s;s Byron will have your guardian? I thought you loved Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">
So I do, madam, as my own &s;elf, and more than my&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible&mdash;But the &s;urprize, madam&mdash;In|deed I am glad! What makes me &s;uch a fool?&mdash;In|deed I am glad!&mdash;What ails me, to cry, I wonder! It is what I wi&s;hed, what I prayed for, night and day. Dear madam, don't tell any-body. I am a&s;hamed of my&s;elf,</P>
<P>The &s;weet April-faced girl then &s;miled through her tears.</P>
<P>I was charmed with her innocent &s;en&s;ibility; and if you are not, I &s;hall think le&s;s of you than ever I did yet.</P>
<P>Dear madam, &s;aid &s;he, permit me to withdraw for a few minutes: I mu&s;t have my cry out&mdash;And I &s;hall then be all joy and gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>She tript away; and in half an hour came down to me with quite another face.</P>
<P>Lady L. was then with me. I had told her of the girl's emotion. We are equally lovers of you, my dear, &s;aid I: you need not be afraid of Lady L.</P>
<P>And have you told, madam?&mdash;Well, but I am not a hypocrite. What a &s;trange thing! I who have al|ways been &s;o much afraid of another Lady, for Mi&s;s Byron's &s;ake, to be &s;o oddly affected, as if I were &s;orry!&mdash;Indeed I rejoice.&mdash;But if you tell Mi&s;s Byron, &s;he won't love me: She won't let me live with her and my guardian, when &s;he is happy, and has made him &s;o. And what &s;hall I do then? for I have &s;et my heart upon it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron, my dear, loves you &s;o well, that &s;he will not be able to deny you any-thing your heart is &s;et upon, that is in her power to grant.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s Mi&s;s Byron as I love her, and &s;he will be the happie&s;t of women!&mdash;But what was the matter with me?&mdash;Yet I believe I know!&mdash;My poor mother had been crying &s;adly to me, for her pa&s;t unhappy life. She ki&s;&s;ed me, as &s;he &s;aid, for my <HI>Father's</HI> 
<PB N="34" REF="35">
&s;ake: She had been the wor&s;t of wives to the be&s;t of hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>Again the good girl wept at her mother's remem|bered remor&s;e&mdash;My guar&mdash;my guardian's goodne&s;s, my mother &s;aid, had awakened her to a &s;en&s;e of her wickedne&s;s. My poor mother did not &s;pare her&s;elf: And I was all &s;orrow; for what could I &s;ay to her on &s;uch a &s;ubject?&mdash;And all the way that I came home in the coach, I did nothing but cry. I had but ju&s;t dried my eyes, and tried to look chearful, when you came in. And then, when you told me the good news, &s;omething &s;truck me all at once, &s;truck my very heart; I cannot account for it: I know not what to liken it to&mdash;And had I not bur&s;t into tears. I believe it would have been wor&s;e for me. But now I am my&s;elf; and if my poor mother could pacify her con&s;cience, I &s;hould be a happy creature&mdash;<HI>becau&s;e</HI> of Mi&s;s Byron's happine&s;s. You look at each other, Ladies: But if you think I &s;hould <HI>not,</HI> bid me be gone from your pre|&s;ence for a fal&s;e girl, and never &s;ee you more.</P>
<P>Now, Harriet, this emotion of Emily appears to me as a &s;ort of phaenomenon. Do <HI>you</HI> account for it as you will; but I am &s;ure Emily is no hypocrite: She has no art: She <HI>believes</HI> what &s;he &s;ays, that her &s;udden bur&s;t of tears was owing to her heart being af|fected by her mother's contrition: And I am al&s;o &s;ure that &s;he loves you above all the women in the world. Yet it is po&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ubtle thief, ycleped Love, had got very near her heart; and ju&s;t at the moment threw a dart into one angle of it, which was the <HI>&s;ome|thing</HI> that &s;truck her, all at once, as &s;he phra&s;ed it, and made her find tears a relief. This I know, my dear, that we may be very differently affected by the &s;ame event, when judged of at a di&s;tance, and near. If you don't already, or if you &s;oon will not, expe|rience the truth of this ob&s;ervation in the great event before you, I am much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
But you &s;ee, Harriet, what joy this happy decla|ration of my brother, and the kind reception it has met with from Northampton&s;hire, has given us all. We will keep your &s;ecret, never fear, till all is over; and, when it is, you &s;hall let my brother know, from the Letters we have had the favour of &s;eeing, as much as <HI>we</HI> do. Till he does, excellent as he thinks you, he will not know one half of your excellencies, nor the merit which your Love and your Su&s;pen&s;es have made you with him.</P>
<P>But, with you, I long for the arrival of the next Letters from Italy. God grant that Lady Clemen|tina hold her re&s;olution, now that &s;he &s;ees it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for her to avoid marrying. If &s;he &s;hould relent, what would be the con&s;equence, to my bro|ther, to her&s;elf, to you! And how &s;hall all we, his friends and yours, be affected! You think the Lady is obliged, in duty to her parents, to marry. Lady L. and I are determined to be wi&s;e, and not give our opi|nions till the events which are yet in the bo&s;om of Fate, di&s;clo&s;ing them&s;elves, &s;hall not leave us a po&s;&s;i|bility of being much mi&s;taken. And yet, as to what the filial duty requires of her, we think &s;he ought to marry. Mean time, I repeat, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'God grant that Lady Clementina now hold her mind!'</Q></P>
<P>LADY L. &s;ends up her name. Formality in <HI>her,</HI> &s;urely. I will chide her. But here &s;he comes.&mdash;I love, Harriet, to write to the moment; that's a knack I had from you and my brother: And be &s;ure conti|nue it, on every occa&s;ion: No <HI>pathetic</HI> without it!</P>

<P>WHAT have I done to my Charlotte? Is there not &s;omething cold and particular in your &s;tile, e&s;pecially in that part of your Letter preceding the entrance of my good Lady L.?

<P>And what, my dear, if Lady Clementina <HI>&s;hould</HI> RELENT, as you phra&s;e it? My <HI>friends</HI> might be now grieved&mdash;Well, and I might be affected too, more than if the vi&s;it to my grandmamma had not been made: I own it.&mdash;But the high veneration I truly profe&s;s to have for Lady Clementina, would be parade and preten&s;ion, if, whatever became of your Harriet, I did not re&s;olve, in that ca&s;e, to <HI>try,</HI> at lea&s;t, to make my&s;elf ea&s;y, and give up to her prior and worthier claim: And I &s;hould con&s;ider her <HI>effort,</HI> tho' un&s;ucce&s;sful, as having intitled her to my highe&s;t e&s;teem. To what we know to be right, we ought to &s;ubmit; the more difficult, the more meritorious: And, in this ca&s;e, your Harriet would conquer, or die. If &s;he conquered, &s;he would then, in <HI>that</HI> in&s;tance, be greater than even Clementina.

<P>My uncle &s;et out for Peterborough, in order to bring Mr. Deane with him to Selby-hou&s;e. Poor Mr. Deane had kept his chamber for a week before; yet had not let us know he was ill. He was forbid to go abroad for two days more; but was &s;o overjoyed at what my uncle communicated to him, that he &s;aid, he was not &s;en&s;ible of alling any-thing; and he would have come with my uncle next day, but nei|ther he nor the doctor would permit it: But on Tue&s;|day he came.&mdash;Such joy!&mdash;Dear good man!&mdash;Such congratulation!&mdash;How con&s;iderable, to their happi|ne&s;s, do they all make that of their too-too much ob|liged Harriet!</P>
<P>They have been in con&s;ultation often; but they have excluded me from &s;ome particular ones. I gue&s;s the &s;ubject; and beg of them, that I may not be <HI>too much</HI> obliged. What critical &s;ituations have I been in! When will they be at an end.</P>
<P>Mr. Deane has written to Sir Charles. I am not to know the contents of his Letter. The hearts of us women, when we are urged to give way to a <HI>clan|de&s;tine</HI> and <HI>unequal</HI> addre&s;s, or when inclined to fa|vour &s;uch a one, are apt, and are pleaded with, to ri&s;e again&s;t the notions of bargain and &s;ale. <HI>Smithfield bargains,</HI> you Londoners call them: But unju&s;t is the odium, if preliminaries are nece&s;&s;ary in all treaties of this nature. And &s;urely previous &s;tipulations are in|di&s;pen&s;ably &s;o among us changeable mortals, however promi&s;ing the &s;un&s;hine may be at our &s;etting out on the journey of life; a journey too that will not be ended but with the life of one of the travellers.</P>
<P>If I ever were to be tempted to wi&s;h for great
<PB N="41" REF="42">
wealth, it would be for the &s;ake of Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on; that I might be a means of enlarging his power: Since I am convinced, that the nece&s;&s;ities of every worthy per&s;on within the large circle of his ac|quaintance, would be relieved, according to his abi|lity.</P>
<P>My dear Emily!&mdash;Ah Lady G.! Was it <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> for you to think, that my pity for the amiable Innocent &s;hould not increa&s;e my love of her! I will give you leave <HI>indeed</HI> to de&s;pi&s;e me, if you ever find any-thing in my behaviour to Emily, let me be circum&s;tanced as I will, that &s;hall &s;hew an abatement of that tender affection which ever mu&s;t warm my heart in her fa|vour. Whenever I can promi&s;e any-thing for my&s;elf, then &s;hall Emily be a partaker of my felicity, in the way her own heart &s;hall direct. I hope, for <HI>her own</HI> &s;ake, that the dear girl puts the matter right, when &s;he attributes her &s;udden bur&s;t of tears to the weakne&s;s of her &s;pirits occa&s;ioned by her mother's remor&s;e: But let me &s;ay one thing; It would grieve me as much as it did Sir Charles, in the Count of Belvedere's ca&s;e, to &s;tand in the way of any-body's happine&s;s. It is not, you &s;ee, your <HI>brother</HI>'s fault, that he is not the hu&s;band of Lady Clementina: She wi&s;hes him to marry an Engli&s;hwoman.&mdash;Nor is even the hope of Lady Olivia fru&s;trated by me. You know I always pitied her; and that before I knew, from Sir Charles's Letter to Signor Jeronymo, that &s;he thought kindly of me.&mdash;Lady Anne S.; Do you think, my dear, that worthy Lady could have hopes, were it <HI>not</HI> for me?&mdash;And could my Emily have any, were I out of the world?&mdash;No, &s;urely: The very <HI>ward&s;hip,</HI> which he executes with &s;o much indulgent goodne&s;s to her, would ex|clude all &s;uch hopes, con&s;iderable enough as his e&s;tate is, to an&s;wer a larger fortune than even Emily's. Were hers not half &s;o much as it is, it would perhaps be more likely than now, that his generous mind might be di&s;po&s;ed in her favour, &s;ome years hence.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="43">
Let me, however, tell you, that true &s;i&s;terly pity overwhelmed my heart, when I fir&s;t read that part of your Letter which &s;o pathetically de&s;cribes her tender woe. Be the occa&s;ion her Duty, or her Love, or owing to a mixture of both, I am charmed with her beautiful &s;implicity: I wept over that part of your Letter for half an hour (for I was by my&s;elf); and more than once I looked round and round me, wi&s;hing for the dear creature to be near me, and want|ing to cla&s;p her to my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Love me &s;till, and that as well as ever, my dear Lady G. or I &s;hall want a great ingredient of happi|ne&s;s, in whatever &s;ituation I may be. I have written to thank my dear Lady L. for her goodne&s;s to me, in dictating to your pen; and I thank you, my dear, for being dictated to. I cannot be well.

<P>A Thou&s;and thanks to you, my dear Lady G. for the favour of your la&s;t: You have re-a&s;&s;ured me in it. I think I could not have been happy even in the affection of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, were I to have found an abatement in the Love of his two &s;i&s;ters.

<P><PB N="45" REF="46">
I have a Letter from the Counte&s;s of D <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This Letter does not appear.</NOTE>.

<P>I pity from my heart Lady Anne S. What a dread|ful thing is hopele&s;s Love; the object &s;o worthy, that every mouth is full of his prai&s;es!

<P>I have a Letter from Sir Rowland Meredith <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This Letter appears not.</NOTE>You, who have &s;een his former Letters to me, need not be &s;hewn this. The &s;ame hone&s;t heart appears in them all; the &s;ame kind profe&s;&s;ions of paternal love. You love Sir Rowland; and will be plea&s;ed to hear that his worthy nephew is likely to recover his health: I cannot, however, be joyful that they are re&s;olved to make me &s;oon one more vi&s;it. But you will &s;ee that Mr. Fowler thinks, if he could be allowed to vi&s;it me once more, he &s;hould, tho' hoping nothing from the vi&s;it, be ea&s;ier for the re&s;t of his life. A &s;trange way of thinking! &s;uppo&s;ing Love to be his di&s;temper: Is it not?</P>
<P>I have a Letter from Mr. Fenwick. He is arrived at his &s;eat near Daventry. He has made a very &s;hort excur&s;ion abroad. He tells me in it, that he de&s;igns me a vi&s;it on a particular &s;ubject. If it be, as I &s;u&s;pect, to engage my intere&s;t with my Lucy, he &s;hall <HI>not</HI> have her: He is not worthy of her.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip and favour of Lady W. is one of the great felicities which &s;eem to offer to ble&s;s my future lot.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville is the mo&s;t per&s;evering, as well as mo&s;t audacious of men. As other men endeavour to gain a woman's affections by politene&s;s; he makes pride, ill-nature, and impetuo&s;ity, the proofs of his Love;
<PB N="47" REF="48">
and thinks him&s;elf ill u&s;ed, e&s;pecially &s;ince his large acqui&s;ition of fortune, that they are not accepted as &s;uch. He has obliged Mr. Deane to hear his pleas; and pre&s;umed to hope for his favour. Mr. Deane frankly told him, that his intere&s;t lay quite another way. He then in&s;olently threatened with de&s;truction, the man, be he who he will, that &s;hall &s;tand in his way. He doubts not, he &s;ays, but Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on is the man de&s;igned: But if &s;o <HI>cool</HI> a Lover is to be encouraged again&s;t &s;o <HI>&s;ervent</HI> a one as him&s;elf, he is mi&s;taken in all his notions of womens conduct and judgments in Love-matters. A <HI>di&s;crect</HI> Lover, he &s;ays, is an unnatural character: Women, the odious wretch &s;ays, love to be devoured (Is he not an odious wretch?) and if Mi&s;s Byron can content her&s;elf with another woman's <HI>leavings,</HI> for that, he &s;ays, he is well in|formed is the ca&s;e, he knows what he &s;hall think of her &s;pirit. And then he threw out, as u&s;ual, re|flections on our Sex, which had malice in them.</P>
<P>This man's threats di&s;turb me. God grant that your brother may not meet with any more embar|ra&s;ments from in&s;olent men, on my account!</P>
<P>If the&s;e men, this Greville in particular, would let me be at peace, I &s;hould be better, I believe, in my health: But Lady Frampton is his advocate, by Let|ter. He watches my foot&s;teps, and, in every vi&s;it I make, throws him&s;elf in the way: And on Sundays he is always ready with his officious hand, as I alight to enter the church, and to lead me back to my uncle's coach. My uncle cannot affront him, be|cau&s;e he will not be affronted by him. He rallies off, with an intrepidity that never was exceeded, all that my aunt &s;ays to him. I repul&s;e him with anger every|where but in a place &s;o public, and &s;o &s;acred. He di&s;|turbs my devotion, with his &s;taring eyes, always fixed on our pew; which draw every one's after them. He has the a&s;&s;urance, when he intrudes him&s;elf into my company, to laugh off my anger; telling me,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
that it is what he has long wi&s;hed for; and that now he is &s;o much u&s;ed to it, that he can live on my frowns, and cannot &s;upport life without them. He plainly tells me, that Mr. Fenwick's arrival from abroad, and another certain per&s;on's al&s;o, are the occa&s;ion of his re&s;umed &s;edulity.</P>
<P>Every-body about us, in &s;hort, is intere&s;ted for or again&s;t him. He makes me appear coy and ridicu|lous. He&mdash;But no more of this bold man. Would to Heaven that &s;ome one of tho&s;e who like &s;uch, would relieve me from him!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Selby-hou&s;e, <DATE>Tue&s;day, Oct. <HI>3.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AN alliance more acceptable, were it with a prince, could not be propo&s;ed, than that which Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, in a manner &s;o worthy of him|&s;elf, has propo&s;ed with a family who have thought them&s;elves under obligation to him, ever &s;ince he de|livered the darling of it from the lawle&s;s attempts of a &s;avage Libertine. I know to whom I write; and will own, that it has been <HI>my</HI> wi&s;h, in a mo&s;t parti|cular manner.</P>
<P>As to the &s;urviving part of the family, <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of Mi&s;s Byron (for I will mention her parents by-and-by) it is, in all its branches, worthy. Indeed, Sir, your wi&s;h of a relation to <HI>them,</HI> is not a di&s;credit to your high character. As to the young Lady&mdash;I &s;ay nothing of her&mdash;Yet how &s;hall I forbear&mdash;O Sir, be|lieve me! &s;he will dignify your choice. Her duty
<PB N="49" REF="50">
and her inclination through every relation of life, were never divided.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Sir&mdash;No parent was ever more fond of his child than I have been, from her infancy, of this my daughter by adoption. Hence, Sir, being con|&s;ulted on this occa&s;ion, as my affection I will &s;ay for the whole family de&s;erves, I take upon me to acquaint you, before any further &s;teps are taken, what our dear child's fortune will be: For it has been always my notion, that a young gentleman, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;hould, the moment he offers him&s;elf, if his own pro|po&s;als are acceptable, be &s;pared the <HI>indelicacy</HI> of ask|ing que&s;tions as to fortune. We know, Sir, yours is great: But as your &s;pirit is princely, you ought to have &s;omething worthy of your own fortune with a wife. But here, alas! we mu&s;t fail, I doubt; at lea&s;t, in hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Byron was one of the be&s;t of men; his Lady a mo&s;t excellent woman: There never was a happier pair. Both had rea&s;on to boa&s;t of their ance&s;try, His e&s;tate was upwards of Four thou&s;and pounds a year; but it was entailed, and, in failure of male heirs, was to de&s;cend to a &s;econd branch of the family which had made it&s;elf the more unworthy of it, by &s;ettling in a foreign country, renouncing, as I may &s;ay, its own Mr. Byron died a young man, and left his Lady <HI>en&s;ient;</HI> but grief for lo&s;ing him, occa&s;ioned fir&s;t her mi&s;carriage, and then her death; and the e&s;tate followed the name. Hence, be plea&s;ed to know, that Mi&s;s Byron's fortune, in her own right is no more than between Thirteen and Fourteen thou&s;and pounds. It is chiefly in the funds. It has been called 15,000<HI>l.</HI> but it is not much more than thirteen. Her grandmother's jointure is between 4 and 500<HI>l.</HI> a year. We none of us wi&s;h to &s;ee my god-daughter in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it: She her&s;elf lea&s;t of all. Mrs. Shirley is called, by every one that knows her, or &s;peaks of her, The ornament of old age. Her husband, an
<PB N="50" REF="51">
excellent man, de&s;ired her to live always in the man|&s;ion-hou&s;e, and in the ho&s;pitable way he had ever kept up, if what he left her would &s;upport her in it. She has been longer &s;pared to the prayers of her friends, and to tho&s;e of the poor, than was appre|hended; for &s;he is but infirm in health. She there|fore can do but little towards the increa&s;e of her child's fortune. But Shirley-manor is a fine old &s;eat, Sir!&mdash;And there is timber upon the e&s;tate, which wants but ten years growth, and will be felled to good account. Mr. Selby is well in the world. He propo&s;es, as a token of his love, to add 3000<HI>l,</HI> in hand to his niece's fortune; and by his will, &s;omething very con&s;iderable, farther expectant on his Lady's death; who being Mi&s;s Byron's aunt, by the father's &s;ide, intends by her will to do very hand&s;omely for her.&mdash;By the way, my dear Sir, be a&s;&s;ured, that what I write is ab&s;olutely unknown to Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>There <HI>is</HI> a man who loves her as he loves him&s;elf. This man has laid by a &s;um of money every year for the advancing her in marriage, beginning with the fifth year of her life, when it was &s;een what a hopeful child &s;he was: This has been putout at accumulated in|tere&s;t; and it amounts, in &s;ixteen years, or there|abouts, to very near 8000<HI>l,</HI> This man, Sir will make up the eight thou&s;and, ten, to be paid on the day of marriage: And I hope, without promi&s;ing for what this man will do further at his death, that you will accept of this Five or Six-and-twenty thou&s;and Pounds, as the chearfulle&s;t given and be&s;t-be&s;towed money that ever was laid out.</P>
<P>Let not the&s;e particulars pain you, Sir: They &s;hould not; The &s;ubject is a nece&s;&s;ary one. You, who ought to give way to the increa&s;e of that power which you &s;o nobly u&s;e, mu&s;t not be pained at this mention, once for all. Princes, Sir, are not above asking money of their people as free-gifts, on the marriage of their children. He that would be greater than a prince
<PB N="51" REF="52">
may, before he is aware, be le&s;s than a gentleman. Of this ten thou&s;and pounds, Eight is Mi&s;s Byron's due, as &s;he is likely to be &s;o happy with all our con|&s;ents; el&s;e it would not: For that was the man's <HI>re|&s;erved</HI> condition; and the &s;um, or the de&s;ignation of it, was till this day only known to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to &s;ettlements in return, I would have acted the lawyer, but the <HI>hone&s;t</HI> lawyer, with you, Sir, and made demands of you; but Mr. and Mrs Selby, and Mrs. Shirley, unanimou&s;ly declare, that you &s;hall not be pre&s;cribed to in this ca&s;e. Were you not Sir Charles Grandi&s;on? was the que&s;tion. I was again&s;t leaving it to you, for that <HI>very</HI> rea&s;on. It will be, &s;aid I, to provoke &s;uch a man as Sir Charles to do too much. Mo&s;t other men ought to be &s;purred; but <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t be held in. But, however, I acquie&s;ced; and the more ea&s;ily, becau&s;e I expect that the deeds &s;hall pa&s;s through my hands; and I will take care that you &s;hall not, in order to give a proof of Love where it is not wanted, exert an inadequate genero|&s;ity.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters I thought it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to apprize you of: You will have the goodne&s;s to ex|cu&s;e any imperfections in my manner of writing. There are none in my heart, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that no man breathing can more re&s;pect you, than, Sir.</P>

<P>YOU know not, my dear Mr. Deane upon what an unthankful man you would be&s;tow your fa|vours. I pretend not to be above complying with the
<PB N="52" REF="53">
laudable cu&s;toms of the world. Princes are examples to them&s;elves. I have always, in things indifferent, been willing to take the world as I find it; and con|form to it.</P>
<P>To &s;ay Mi&s;s Byron is a trea&s;ure in her&s;elf, is what every man would &s;ay, who has the honour to know her: Yet I would not, in a vain o&s;tentation, as the in|tere&s;t of a man and his wife is one, make a compli|ment to my affection by re&s;igning or giving from her her natural right; e&s;pecially as there is no one of her family that wants to be benefited by &s;uch gifts or re|&s;ignations. But then I will not allow, that any of her friends &s;hall part with what is theirs, to &s;upply&mdash;What? A <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> deficiency in her fortune. And by <HI>whom,</HI> as implied by you, &s;uppo&s;ed a deficiency?&mdash;By me; and it is left to me to <HI>confirm</HI> the imputation by my acceptance of the addition &s;o generou&s;ly, as to the <HI>intention,</HI> offered. Had I incumbrances on my e&s;tate, which, undi&s;charged, would involve in difficul|ties the woman I love; I know not what, for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake, I might be tempted to do. But avarice only can in|duce a man who wants it not to accept of the bounty of a Lady's friends, in their life-time e&s;pecially&mdash;When tho&s;e friends are not either father or mother; one of them not a relation by blood, tho' he is by a nearer tye, that of Love: And it is not the fortune which the Lady po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in her own right, an ample one?</P>
<P>I am as rich as I wi&s;h to be, my dear Mr. Deane. Were my income le&s;s, I would live within it; were it more, it would increa&s;e my duties. Permit me, my good Sir to ask, Has the MAN, as you call him (and a MAN indeed he appears to me to be) who intends to make &s;o noble a pre&s;ent to a &s;tranger, no relations, no friends, who would have rea&s;on to think them|&s;elves unkindly treated, if he gave from them &s;uch a large portion of his fortune?</P>
<P>I would not be thought romantic; neither aim I at
<PB N="53" REF="54">
o&s;tentation. I would be as glad to <HI>follow,</HI> as to <HI>&s;et,</HI> a good example. Can I have a nobler, if Mi&s;s Byron honours me with her hand, than &s;he, in <HI>that</HI> ca&s;e, will give in preferring me to the Earl of D. a worthy man, with a much more &s;plendid fortune than mine? Believe me, my dear Mr. Deane, it would, on an e|vent &s;o happy, be a re&s;traint to my own joy before friends &s;o kindly contributing to the increa&s;e of her fortune, le&s;t they &s;hould imagine that their genero&s;ity on the occa&s;ion, was one of the motives of my gra|titude to her for her goodne&s;s to me,</P>
<P>You tell me, that Mi&s;s Byron knows nothing of your propo&s;als: I be&s;eech you, let her <HI>not</HI> know any|thing of them: Aba&s;e not &s;o much, in her eye, the man who pre&s;umes on her favour for the happine&s;s of the re&s;t of his life, by &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>(Your</HI> &s;uppo&s;ition, Sir, may have weight with <HI>her)</HI> he could value her the more for &s;uch an addition to her fortune. No, Sir: Let Mi&s;s Byron (&s;atisfied with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a worth which all the world acknowleges) in one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn events of her life look round among her congratulating friends with that mode&s;t confidence which the &s;en&s;e of laying a high obligation on a fa|voured object gives to diffident merit; and which the receiving of favours from all her friends, as if to &s;up|ply a &s;uppo&s;ed defective worth, mu&s;t either abate; or, if it do not, make her think le&s;s of the intere&s;ted man, who could &s;ubmit to owe &s;uch obligations.</P>
<P>If the&s;e friendly expo&s;tulations conclude again&s;t the offer of your <HI>generous friend,</HI> they equally do &s;o again&s;t that of Mr. Selby. Were that Gentleman and his Lady the <HI>parents</HI> of Mi&s;s Byron, the ca&s;e would be different: But Mi&s;s Byron's fortune is an <HI>a&s;certained</HI> one; and Mr. Selby has relations who &s;tand in an equal degree of con&s;anguinity to him, and who are all intitled, by their worthine&s;s, to his favour. My be&s;t re&s;pects and thanks are however due; and I beg you
<PB N="54" REF="55">
will make my acknowledgments accordingly, as well to your <HI>worthy friend,</HI> as to Mr. Selby.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to &s;end you down the rent-roll of my Engli&s;h e&s;tate. Determine for me as you plea&s;e, my deare&s;t Mr. Deane. Only take this caution&mdash;Af|front me not a &s;econd time; but let the &s;ettlements be &s;uch, as may be fully an&s;werable to my fortune; altho', in the common methods of calculation, it may exceed that of the dear Lady That you may be the better judge of this, you will find a brief particular of my Iri&s;h E&s;tate, &s;ubjoined to the other.</P>
<P>I was intending, when I received yours, to do my|&s;elf the honour of a vi&s;it to Selby-hou&s;e. I am im|patient to throw my&s;elf at the feet of my dear Mi&s;s Byron, and to commend my&s;elf to the favour of Mr. and Mrs. Selby, and every one of a family I am pre|pared by their characters, as well as by their relation to Mi&s;s Byron, to revere and love. But as you &s;eem to choo&s;e that the requi&s;ite preliminaries &s;hould be fir&s;t adju&s;ted by pen and ink, I &s;ubmit, tho' with reluct|ance, to that cour&s;e; but with the le&s;s, as I may, in the interim, receive Letters from abroad, which, tho' they can now make no alteration with regard to the treaty &s;o happily begun, may give me an opportunity of laying the whole &s;tate of my affairs before Mi&s;s Byron; by which means &s;he will be enabled to form a judgment of them, and of the heart of, dear Sir,</P>

<P>WELL did you ob&s;erve, my dear that we may be very differently affected by the &s;ame e|vent, when judged of at a di&s;tance, and near. May I, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, pre&s;ume to &s;ay <HI>near?</HI> Mr. Deane has entered into the particulars of my fortune with Sir Charles. The Letter was not &s;hewn me be|fore it went; and I was not permitted to &s;ee the co|py of it till your brother's an&s;wer came; and then they &s;hewed me both.</P>
<P>O my dear Mr. Deane! my ever-kind uncle and aunt Selby! Was not your Harriet Byron too much obliged to you before?&mdash;As to your brother, What, my love, &s;hall I do with my <HI>pride?</HI> I did not know I had &s;o much of that bad quality. My poverty, my dear, has added to my pride. Were my fortune &s;u|perior to that of your brother, I am &s;ure I &s;hould not be &s;o proud as I now, on this occa&s;ion, find I am. How generou&s;ly does he decline accepting the good|ne&s;s that was offered to give me more con&s;ideration with him (as kindly intended by them)! What can I &s;ay to him, but that his heart, &s;till prouder than my own, and more generous than that of any other per|&s;on breathing, will not permit me to owe uncommon obligations to any but him&s;elf?</P>
<P>He de&s;ires that I may not know any-thing of this tran&s;action: But they thought the communication would give me plea&s;ure. However, they wi&s;h me not to take notice to him, when he vi&s;its Selby-hou&s;e, that they have communicated it to me. If I did, I &s;hould think my&s;elf obliged to manife&s;t a gratitude that would embarra&s;s me, in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and
<PB N="56" REF="57">
&s;eem to fetter the freedom of my will. Millions of obligations &s;hould not bribe me to give up even a cor|ner of my heart, to a man to whom I could not give the whole. Your brother, my dear, is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole.</P>
<P>You know that I hate affectation: But mu&s;t I not have great abatements in my pro&s;pects of happine&s;s, becau&s;e of Lady Clementina? And mu&s;t they not be &s;till greater, &s;hould &s;he be unhappy, &s;hould &s;he repent of the re&s;olution &s;he &s;o nobly took, for his &s;aying, that whatever be the contents of his next Letters from Italy, they can make no alteration with regard to the treaty begun with us?&mdash;Dear, dear Clementina! mo&s;t excellent of women! Can I bear to &s;tand in the way of your happine&s;s?&mdash;I cannot&mdash;<HI>My</HI> life, any more than yours, may not be a long one; and I will not fully the whitene&s;s of it (Pardon my vanity; I pre|&s;ume to call it &s;o, on retro&s;pecting it, regarding my <HI>intentions</HI> only) by giving way to an act of inju&s;tice, tho' it were to obtain for me the whole heart of the man I love.</P>
<P>Yet think you, my dear, that I am not mortified? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'How can I look round upon my congratulating friends, in one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn events of my life, with that mode&s;t confidence which the &s;en&s;e of laying an obligation on a favoured object'</Q> (You know in who&s;e generous words I expre&s;s my&s;elf) <Q REND="inline">'gives to diffident merit?'</Q> O my Charlotte!

<SALUTE>My dear Lady <HI>G.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Expect your brother every hour. I hope he comes in pur&s;uance of Letters from Italy!&mdash;May it be &s;o! and &s;uch as will not abate his welcome!</P>
<P>We heard by accident of his approach, by a farmer, tenant to my uncle; who &s;aw a fine gentleman, very hand&s;omely attended, alight, as he left Statford, at the very inn where we baited on our return from Lon|don. As a dinner was preparing for him, perhaps, my dear, he will dine in the very room he dined in at that time. The farmer had the curio&s;ity to a&s;k
<PB N="59" REF="60">
who he was; and was an&s;wered by the mo&s;t cour|teous gentleman's &s;ervants he ever &s;poke to, that they had the honour to &s;erve Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. And the farmer having &s;aid he was of Northampton; one of them a&s;ked him, How far Selby-hou&s;e was from that town? The farmer was obliged to hurry home on his own affairs; and meeting my uncle with Mr. Deane, and my cou&s;in James Selby, taking an airing on hor&s;eback, told him the vi&s;iter he was likely to have. My uncle in&s;tantly di&s;patched his &s;ervant to us with the tidings, and that he was gone to meet him, in hopes of conducting him hither.</P>
<P>This news gave me &s;o much emotion, being not well before, that my aunt advi&s;ed me to retire to my clo&s;et, and endeavour to quiet my Spirits.</P>
<P>Here then I am, my dear Lady G. and the writing-implements being alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> at hand in this place, I took up my pen. It is not po&s;&s;ible for me to write at this time, but to you, and on this &s;ubject. It is good for a bu&s;y mind to have &s;omething to be employed in; and I think, now I am amu&s;ing my&s;elf on paper, my heart is a little more governable than it was.</P>
<P>I am glad we heard of his coming before we &s;aw him. But &s;urely Sir Charles Grandi&s;on &s;hould not have attempted to <HI>&s;urpri&s;e</HI> us: Should he, my dear? Does it not look like the pride of a man a&s;&s;ured of a joyful welcome? I have read of princes, who, ac|quianted with their Ladies by picture only, and having been married by proxy, have &s;et out to their frontiers in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ognito, and in di&s;gui&s;e have affected to &s;urpri&s;e the poor apprehen&s;ive bride.&mdash;But here, not only cir|cum&s;tances differ, &s;ince there has been no betroth|ment; but were he of princely rank, I &s;hould have expected a more delicate treatment from him.&mdash;</P>
<P>How will the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inferiority and obli|gation &s;et a proud and punctilious mind upon hunting for occa&s;ions to ju&s;tify its caprices!&mdash;A &s;ervant of
<PB N="60" REF="61">
Sir Charles is ju&s;t arrived with a billet directed for my uncle Selby. My aunt opened it. It is dated from Stratford. The contents are, after compliments of enquiry of our healths, to acquaint my uncle, that he &s;hall put up at the George at Northampton, this night; and hopes to be allowed to pay his compliments to us to-morrow morning, at breakfa&s;t: So he did not <HI>in|tend</HI> to give him&s;elf the con&s;equence, of which my capricious heart was &s;o apprehen&s;ive. Yet then, as if re&s;olved to find fault, Is not this a little too parading for his natural freedom? thought I: Or does he think we &s;hould not be able to outlive our joyful &s;urprize, if he gave us not notice of his arrival in the&s;e parts be|fore he &s;aw us?&mdash;O Clementina!&mdash;Goodne&s;s! Angel! What a meremortal, what a woman, do&s;t thou make the poor Harriet Byron appear in her own eyes! How apprehen&s;ive of coming after thee! The &s;en&s;e I have of my own littlene&s;s, will make me little, indeed!</P>
<P>Well, but I pre&s;ume, that if my uncle and Mr. Deane meet him, they will prevail on him to come hither this night: Yet I &s;uppo&s;e he mu&s;t be allowed to go to the propo&s;ed inn afterwards.&mdash;But here, he is come!&mdash;Come, indeed!&mdash;My uncle in the chariot with him! My cou&s;in and Mr. Deane, Sally tells me, ju&s;t alighted. Sally adores Sir Charles Grandi&s;on&mdash;Begone, Sally. Thy emotions, fooli&s;h wench, add to tho&s;e of thy mi&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;</P>
<P>THAT I might avoid the appearance of affectation, I was going down to welcome him when I met my uncle on the &s;tairs. Niece Byron, &s;aid he, you have not done <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. I thought your <HI>Love-&s;ick heart</HI> (What words were the&s;e, my dear! and at that moment too!) mu&s;t have been par|tial to him. He prevailed on me to go into his cha|riot. You may think your&s;elf very happy. For fif|teen miles together did he talk of nobody but you. Let <HI>me</HI> go down with you: Let me pre&s;ent you to him.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">
I had before be&s;ought my &s;pirits to befriend me, but for one half-hour. Surely there is nothing &s;o un|welcome as an un&s;ea&s;onable je&s;t. <HI>Pre&s;ent me to him! Love-&s;ick heart!</HI> O my uncle! thought I. I was un|able to proceed. I ha&s;tened back to my clo&s;et, as much di&s;concerted as a child could be, who, having taken pains to get its le&s;&s;on by heart, da&s;hed by a chiding countenance, forgot every &s;yllable of it when it came to <HI>&s;ay</HI> it. You know, my dear, that I had not of &s;ome time been well. My &s;pirits were weak, and joy was almo&s;t as painful to me as grief could have been.</P>
<P>My aunt came up&mdash;My love, why don't you come down?&mdash;What now! Why in tears?&mdash;You will ap|pear, to the fine&s;t man I ever &s;aw in my life, very par|ticular!&mdash;Mr. Deane is in love with him: Your cou|&s;in James&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear madam, I am already, when I make com|pari&s;ons between him and my&s;elf, humbled enough with his excellencies. I did <HI>intend</HI> to avoid particu|larity; but my uncle has quite di&s;concerted me&mdash;Yet he always means well: I ought not to complain. I attend you, madam.</P>
<P>Can you, Lady G. forgive my pride, my petu|lance?</P>
<P>My aunt went down before me. Sir Charles ha&s;|tened to me, the moment I appeared, with an air of re&s;pectful love.</P>
<P>He took my hand, and bowing upon it, I rejoice to &s;ee my dear Mi&s;s Byron; and to &s;ee her &s;o well. How many &s;ufferers mu&s;t there be, when you &s;uffer!</P>
<P>I bid him welcome to England: I hope he heard me: I could not help &s;peaking low: He mu&s;t ob&s;erve my di&s;compo&s;ure. He led me to a &s;eat, and &s;at down by me, &s;till holding my hand. I withdrew it not pre&s;ently, left he &s;hould think me preci&s;e: But, as there were &s;o many per&s;ons pre&s;ent, I thought it was free in Sir Grandi&s;on. Yet perhaps he could
<PB N="62" REF="63">
not well quit it, as I did not withdraw it; &s;o that the fault might be rather in my pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s, than in his forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>However, I a&s;ked my aunt afterwards, If his looks were not tho&s;e of a man a&s;&s;ured of &s;ucce&s;s; as indeed he might be from my grandmother's Letter, and my &s;ilence to <HI>his.</HI> She &s;aid, there was a manly freedom in his addre&s;s to me; but that it had &s;uch a mixture of tenderne&s;s in it, that never, in <HI>her</HI> eyes, was freedom &s;o becoming. While he was re&s;trained by his &s;itua|tion, added &s;he, no wonder that he treated you with re&s;pect only, as a <HI>Friend;</HI> but now he finds him&s;elf at liberty to addre&s;s you, his behaviour ought, as a <HI>Lover,</HI> to have ju&s;t been what it was.</P>
<P>Sir Charles led me into talk, by mentioning you and Lady L. your two Lords, and my Emily.</P>
<P>My uncle and aunt withdrew, and had &s;ome little canva&s;&s;ings, it &s;eems, (All their canva&s;&s;ings are tho&s;e of a&s;&s;ured Lovers) about the propriety of my uncle's invitation to Sir Charles to take up his re&s;idence, while he was in the&s;e parts, at Selby-hou&s;e. My uncle, at coming in, had directed Sir Charles's &s;ervants to put up their hor&s;es: But they, not having their ma&s;ter's orders to do &s;o, held them&s;elves in readine&s;s to attend him; as they knew that Sir Charles had given di|rections to his gentleman, Richard Saunders, who brought the billet to my uncle, to go back to North|hampton, and provide apartments for him at the George inn there.</P>
<P>My aunt, who you know is a perfect judge of points of decorum, pleaded to my uncle, that it was too well known among our &s;elect friends, by Mr. Gre|ville's means, that Sir Charles had never before made his addre&s;&s;es to me; and that therefore, tho' he was to be treated as a man who&s;e alliance is con&s;idered as an honour to us; yet that &s;ome mea&s;ures were to be kept, as to the <HI>look</HI> of the thing; and that the world might not conclude that I was to be won at his very
<PB N="63" REF="64">
fir&s;t appearance; and the rather, as Mr. Greville's vio|lence, as well as virulence, was &s;o well known.</P>
<P>My uncle was petulant. <HI>I,</HI> &s;aid he, am always in the wrong: You women, never. He ran into all tho&s;e peculiarities of words, for which you have &s;o often raillied him&mdash;His <HI>ad&s;heart,</HI> his <HI>female &s;crupulo|&s;ities,</HI> his <HI>What a pize,</HI> his hatred of <HI>&s;hilly-&s;hally's</HI> and <HI>fiddle-faddles,</HI> and the re&s;t of our <HI>female non&s;en&s;es,</HI> as he calls them. He hoped to &s;alute his niece, as Lady Grandi&s;on, in a fortnight: What a <HI>duce</HI> was the mat|ter it could <HI>not</HI> be &s;o, both &s;ides now of a mind?&mdash;He warned my aunt, and bid her warn me, again&s;t affectation, now the cri&s;is was at hand. Sir Charles, he &s;aid, would think meanly of us, if we were <HI>&s;illy:</HI> And then came in another of his odd words: Sir Charles, he &s;aid, had been &s;o much already <HI>bam|boozled,</HI> that he would not have patience with us: and <HI>therefore,</HI> and for all the&s;e <HI>rea&s;ons,</HI> as he called them, he de&s;ired that Sir Charles might not be &s;uffered to go out of the hou&s;e, and to an inn; and this as well for the <HI>propriety</HI> of the thing, as for the credit of his own invitation to him.</P>
<P>My aunt replied, that Sir Charles <HI>him&s;elf</HI> would ex|pect delicacy from us. It was evident, that he ex|pected not (no doubt for the &s;ake of the world's eye) to re&s;ide in the hou&s;e with <HI>me</HI> on his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> vi&s;it, by his having ordered his &s;ervant who brought the billet, to take apartments for him at Northampton, even not de&s;igning to vi&s;it us over-night, had he not been met by Mr. Deane and him&s;elf, and <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> to come. In &s;hort, my dear, &s;aid my aunt, I am as much con|cerned about Sir Charles's <HI>own</HI> opinion of our conduct, as for that of the world: Yet you know, that every genteel family around us expected examples from us, and Harriet. If Sir Charles is not with us, the oftener he vi&s;its us, the more re&s;pectful it will be con&s;trued. I hope he will live with us all day, and every day: But indeed it mu&s;t be as a vi&s;iter, not as an inmate.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">
Why then bring me off &s;ome-how, that I may not &s;eem the blunderer you are always making me by your <HI>documents</HI>&mdash;Will you do <HI>that?</HI></P>
<P>When my uncle and aunt came in, they found Sir Charles, and Dr. Deane, and me, talking. Our &s;ub|ject was, the happine&s;s of Lord and Lady W. and the whole Mansfield family, with whom Mr. Deane, who began the di&s;cour&s;e, is well acquainted. Sir Charles aro&s;e, at their entrance. The night draws on, &s;aid he&mdash;I will do my&s;elf the honour of attending you, madam, and this happy family, at tea in the morn|ing.&mdash;My good Mr. Selby, I had a de&s;ign upon you, and Mr. Deane, and upon you, young gentleman (to my cou&s;in James) as I told you on the road; but it is now too late. Adieu, till to-morrow.&mdash;He bowed to each, to me profoundly, ki&s;&s;ing my hand, and went to his chariot.</P>
<P>My uncle whi&s;pered my aunt, as we all attended him to that door of the hall which leads into the court-yard, to invite him to &s;tay. Hang punctilio! he &s;aid.</P>
<P>My aunt wanted to &s;peak to Sir Charles; yet, &s;he owned, &s;he knew not what to &s;ay: Such a con&s;cious aukwardne&s;s had indeed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us both, as made us unea&s;y: We thought all was not right; yet knew not that we were wrong. But when Sir Charles's chariot drove away with him, and we took our &s;eats, and &s;upper was talked of, we all of us &s;hewed di&s;&s;a|tisfaction; and my uncle was quite out of humour. He would give a thou&s;and pounds, he &s;aid, with all his heart and &s;oul, to find in the morning, Sir Charles, in|&s;tead of coming hither to breakfa&s;t, had &s;et out on his return to London.</P>
<P>For my part, Lady G. I could not bear the&s;e re|criminations. I begged to be excu&s;ed &s;itting down to &s;upper. I was not well; and this odd &s;ituation added <HI>unea&s;ine&s;s</HI> to my indi&s;po&s;ition: A di&s;&s;atisfaction, that I find will mingle with our highe&s;t enjoyments: Nor
<PB N="65" REF="66">
were the beloved company I left, happier. They can|va&s;&s;ed the matter, with &s;o much good-natured earne&s;t|ne&s;s, that the &s;upper was taken away, as it was brought, at a late hour.</P>
<P>What, my dear Lady G. in your opinion, &s;hould we have done? Were we right, or were we wrong? Over-delicacy, as I have heard ob&s;erved, is under|delicacy. You, my dear, your Lord, our Emily, and Dr. Bartlett, all &s;tanding in &s;o well-known a de|gree of relation to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, were our mo&s;t welcome gue&s;ts: And was not the brother to be received with equal warmth of re&s;pect?&mdash;O no! Cu&s;tom, it &s;eems, tyrant cu&s;tom, and the apprehended opinion of the world obliged us (e&s;pecially as &s;o much bu&s;tle had been made about me, by men &s;o bold, &s;o impetuous) to &s;hew him&mdash;Shew him what?&mdash;In effect, that we had expectations upon him, which we could not have upon the brother and &s;i&s;ter; and there|fore, becau&s;e we hoped he would be more <HI>near,</HI> we were to keep him at the <HI>greater</HI> di&s;tance!&mdash;What an indirect acknowledgment was this in his favour, were there room for him to doubt! Which, however, there could not be. What would I give, &s;aid my aunt to me, this moment, to know <HI>his</HI> thoughts of the mat|ter!</P>

<P>We are now in expectation&mdash;My aunt and I, tho' early ri&s;ers, hurried our&s;elves to get every-thing, that however is never out of order, in higher order. Both of us have a kind of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of defect, where yet we cannot find rea&s;on for it: If we did, we &s;hould &s;upply it.

again my pa&s;&s;ive hand, in pre&s;ence of half a &s;core of my friends, Whether I was <HI>greatly</HI> unea&s;y becau&s;e of his ab&s;ence?</P>
<P>But let me try to <HI>excu&s;e</HI> him. May he not have <HI>forfot</HI> his engagement? May he not have <HI>over &s;lept</HI> him&s;elf?&mdash;Some <HI>agreeable dream</HI> of the Bologna fa|mily&mdash;I am offended at him&mdash;Did he learn this tran|quility in Italy?&mdash;O no, no, Lady G.!</P>
<P>I now cannot help looking back for <HI>other</HI> faults in him, with regard to me. My memory is not, how|ever, &s;o malicious, as I would have it. But do you think every man, in the like &s;ituation, would have &s;topt at Stratford to dine by him&s;elf?&mdash;Not but your brother can be very happy in his <HI>own</HI> company. If <HI>he</HI> cannot, who can? But, as to that, his hor&s;es might require re&s;t, as well as baiting: One knows not in how &s;hort a time he might have pro&s;ecuted his journey &s;o far. He who will not &s;uffer the noble&s;t of all ani|mals to be deprived of an ornament, would be mer|ciful to them in greater in&s;tances. He &s;ays, that he cannot bear indignity from &s;uperiors. Neither can we. In that light he appears to us. But why &s;o?&mdash;My heart, Lady G. begins to &s;well I a&s;&s;ure you; and it it twice as big as it was la&s;t night.</P>
<P>My uncle before I came up, &s;at with his watch in his hand, from half an hour after nine, till near ten, telling the minutes as they crept. Mr. Deane often looked at me, and at my aunt, as if to &s;ee how we bore it. I blu&s;hed; looked &s;illy, as if your brother's faults were mine.&mdash;Over in a fortnight! cried my uncle; <HI>ads-heart,</HI> I believe it will be half a year be|fore we &s;hall come to the que&s;tion. But Sir Charles, to be &s;ure, is offended. Your confounded female niceties!</P>
<P>My heart ro&s;e&mdash;Let him, if he <HI>dare,</HI> thought the proud Harriet.</P>
<P>God grant, added my uncle, that he may be gone up to town again&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="69">
Perhaps, &s;aid Mr. Deane, he is gone, by mi&s;take, to Mrs. Shirley's.</P>
<P>We then endeavoured to recollect the words of his &s;elf-invitation hither. My cou&s;in James propo&s;ed to take hor&s;e, and go to Northampton, to inform him&s;elf of the occa&s;ion of his not coming: Some misfortune, perhaps.</P>
<P>Had he not &s;ervants, my aunt a&s;ked, one of whom he might have &s;ent?&mdash;Shall my cou&s;in Jemmy go, however, Harriet, &s;aid &s;he?</P>
<P>No, indeed, an&s;wered I, with an air of anger&mdash;My teazing uncle broke out into a loud laugh, which however had more of a vexedne&s;s than mirth in it.&mdash;He is certainly gone to London, Harriet! <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> as I &s;aid, dame Selby!&mdash;Certainly tearing up the road; his very hor&s;es re&s;enting, for their ma&s;ter, your <HI>&s;crupulo|&s;ities.</HI> You'll hear from him next, at London, my life for yours, niece&mdash;Hah, hah, hah! What will your <HI>grandmamma</HI> &s;ay, by-and-by? Lucy, Nancy, how will <HI>they</HI> &s;tare! La&s;t night's &s;upper, and this day's din|ner, will be alike &s;erved in, and taken away.</P>
<P>I could not &s;tand all this: I aro&s;e from my &s;eat. Are you not unkind, Sir? &s;aid I to my uncle, cour|te&s;ying to him however; and, de&s;iring his and Mr. Deane's excu&s;e, quitted the breakfa&s;ting parlour. Teazing man! &s;aid my aunt. Mr. Deane al&s;o blam|ed him; gently, however; for every-body acknow|ledges his good heart, and natural good temper.</P>
<P>My aunt followed me to the door; and taking my hand, Harriet, &s;aid &s;he, &s;peaking low, Not Sir Charles Grandi&s;on him&s;elf &s;hall call you his, if he is capable of treating you with the lea&s;t indifference. I under&s;tand not this, added &s;he: He cannot &s;urely be offended.&mdash;I hope all will be cleared up before your grandmamma comes: She will be very jealous of the honour of her girl.</P>

<P>What vi&s;iter, &s;aid I, can make a man &s;tay, again&s;t his mind?&mdash;Who can get rid politely of an <HI>impertinent</HI> vi&s;iter, if Sir Charles Grandi&s;on cannot, on a previous engagement?&mdash;But come, madam, I attend you.&mdash;Down we went.</P>
<P>My uncle was out of patience. I was &s;orry for it. I tried to make the be&s;t of it; yet, but to pacify him, &s;hould, perhaps, have had petulance enough my&s;elf to make the wor&s;t of it.&mdash;Oy, oy, with all my heart, &s;aid he, in an&s;wer to my excu&s;es, let us hear what Sir Charles has to &s;ay for him&s;elf. But, old as I am, were my dame Selby to give me another chance, no man on earth, I can tell you, &s;hould keep me from a previous engagement with my mi&s;tre&s;s. It is kind of you, Harriet, to excu&s;e him, however: Love hides a multitude of &s;aults.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">
My aunt &s;aid not one &s;yllable in behalf of Sir Charles. She is vexed, and di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>We made a very &s;hort breakfa&s;ting; and looked upon one another as people who would have helped them&s;elves, if they could. Mr. Deane, however, would engage, he &s;aid, that we &s;hould be fatisfied with Sir Charles's excu&s;es, when we came to hear them.</P>
<P>But, my dear, this man, this vi&s;iter, whoever he is, mu&s;t be of <HI>prodigious</HI> importance, to detain him, from an engagement that I had hoped might have been thought a <HI>fir&s;t</HI> engagement;&mdash;yet owned to be <HI>impertinent.</HI> And mu&s;t not the accident be very un|common, that &s;hould bring &s;uch a one, a &s;tranger as Sir Charles is, in his way? Yet this might very well happen, my uncle ob&s;erves, at an <HI>inn,</HI> whither we thought fit to &s;end him.</P>
<P>Now I think of it, I was &s;trangely di&s;turbed la&s;t night in my imperfect &s;lumbers: Something, I thought, was to happen to prevent me ever being his. But hence, Recollection! I cha&s;e thee from me. Yet when realities di&s;turb, &s;hadows will officiou&s;ly obtrude on the bu&s;y imagination <HI>as</HI> realities.</P>

<P>I Am &s;tolen up again, to tell you how it is. I never will be petulant again&mdash;Dear Sir, forgive me! How wicked in us all, but my grandmamma and Mr. Deane, to blame a man who cannot be guilty of a wilful fault! The fault is all my aunt's and mine&mdash;Was my aunt ever in fault before?</P>
<P>We were all together when he entered. He ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to us, in that noble manner, which en|gages every-body in his favour, at fir&s;t &s;ight. How, &s;aid he, bowing to every one, have I &s;uffered, in be|ing hindered, by an unhappy man, from doing my&s;elf the honour of attending you &s;ooner!</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear, he made not apologies to <HI>me,</HI> as if he &s;uppo&s;ed me di&s;appointed by his ab&s;ence. I was afraid he would. I know I looked very grave.</P>
<P>He then particularly addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to each; to me fir&s;t; next to my grandmamma; and taking one of her hands between both his, and bowing upon it, I rejoice to &s;ee you, madam, &s;aid he&mdash;Your la&s;t fa|vours will ever be remembered by me, with gratitude. I &s;ee you well, I hope. Your Mi&s;s Byron will be well, if <HI>you</HI> are; and <HI>our</HI> joy, looking round him, will then be complete.</P>
<P>She bowed her head, plea&s;ed with his compliment; &s;o were my aunt, and Lucy, and Nancy. I was &s;till a little &s;ullen; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have been plea&s;ed too, that he made my health depend on that of my grand|mamma.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid he, turning to my aunt, I am afraid I made you wait for me at breakfa&s;t. A mo&s;t imper|tinent vi&s;iter! He put me out of humour. I dared not to let you and <HI>yours</HI> (looking at me) &s;ee, how
<PB N="72" REF="73">
much I <HI>could</HI> be out of humour. I am naturally pa&s;|&s;ionate: But pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o ugly, &s;o deforming a thing, that, if I can help it, I will never, by tho&s;e I love, be &s;een in it.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Sir, &s;aid my aunt, you meet with any|thing to di&s;turb you.</P>
<P>My uncle's &s;pirit had not come down: He, too, was &s;ullen in behalf of the punctilio of the girl whom he honours with his jealous Love. How, how, is that, Sir Charles? &s;aid he.</P>
<P>My aunt pre&s;ented Lucy and Nancy to him: But before &s;he could name either&mdash;Mi&s;s Selby, &s;aid he, Mi&s;s Byron's <HI>own</HI> Lucy, I am &s;ure. Mi&s;s Nancy Selby!&mdash;I know your characters, Ladies, &s;aluting each, and I know the intere&s;t you have in Mi&s;s Byron.&mdash;Honour me with <HI>your</HI> approbation, and that will be to give me hope of <HI>hers.</HI></P>
<P>He then turning to my uncle and Mr. Deane, and taking a hand of each&mdash;My dear Mr. Deane, &s;miles upon me, &s;aid he&mdash;But Mr. Selby looks grave.&mdash;</P>
<P>At-<HI>ten</HI> -tive only Sir Charles, to the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of your being put out of humour, that's all&mdash;</P>
<P>The cau&s;e, Mr. Selby!&mdash;Know, then, I met with a man at my inn, who would force him&s;elf upon me: Do you know I am a qurrel&s;ome man? He was &s;o hardy as to declare, that he had preten&s;ions to a Lady in this company, which he was determined to a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>O that Greville! &s;aid my aunt&mdash;</P>
<P>I was ready to &s;ink. Wretched Harriet! thought I, at the in&s;tant: Am I to be for ever the occa&s;ion of embroiling this excellent man!</P>
<P>My grandmamma, Mr. Deane, my uncle, my cou&s;in James, all &s;poke at once&mdash;Dear, dear Sir Charles, &s;aid one, &s;aid another&mdash;How, how, was it?</P>
<P>Both &s;afe! Both unhurt! No more of the ra&s;h man, at this time. He is to be pitied. He loves Mi&s;s Byron to di&s;traction.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
This comes of nicety! whi&s;pered my uncle, to my aunt: <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> nicety!&mdash;To let &s;uch a man as this go to an inn!&mdash;Inho&s;pitable, vile punctilio! Then turn|ing to Sir Charles&mdash;Dear Sir, forgive me! I <HI>was</HI> a little &s;erious, that I mu&s;t own [I pulled my uncle by the &s;leeve, fearing he would &s;ay too much by way of atonement for his &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s]:&mdash;I, I, I, <HI>was</HI> a little &s;e|rious, I mu&s;t own [I, I, I, was afraid &s;omething was the matter&mdash;turned he off, what he was going to &s;ay&mdash;too freely, &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;Hardly &s;o! had he &s;aid what he would; tho' habitual punctilio made me almo&s;t involuntarily twitch my uncle by the &s;leeve: for my heart would have directed my lips to utter the kinde&s;t things; but my concern was too great to allow them to obey it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t go down, Lady G.&mdash;I am enquired after; 'tis ju&s;t dinner-time&mdash;Let me only add, that Sir Charles waved further talk of the affair between him and that wretch, while I &s;taid&mdash;perhaps they have got it out of him &s;ince I came up.</P>
<P>I SHALL be <HI>&s;o</HI> proud, my dear!&mdash;a thou&s;and fine things he has &s;aid of your Harriet, in her little ab|&s;ence!&mdash;Lucy, Nancy, call him THE man: And every one looks upon him as if there were not one &s;oul in company but <HI>he</HI> and them&s;elves. My grand|mamma's eyes are complained of as weak, to co|lour her joyful emotion: But, thank God, her eyes are not weak. And he is &s;o re&s;pectfully tender to her, that had he not my heart before, he would have won it now.</P>
<P>He had again waved the relation of the in&s;ult he met with: Mr. Greville him&s;elf, he &s;uppo&s;ed, would give it. He had a mind to &s;ee if the gentleman, by his report of it, was a gentleman. Thank God, &s;aid he, I have not hurt a man who boa&s;ts of his pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Byron; and of his neighbourhood to this fa|mily!</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="75">
OUR places were cho&s;en for us at table: Sir Charles's next me. Cannot I be too minute, do you &s;ay?&mdash;So ea&s;y, &s;o free, &s;o polite; &s;omething &s;o hap|pily addre&s;&s;ed occa&s;ionally to each per&s;on at table&mdash;O my dear! I am abundantly kept in countenance; for every one loves him, as well as I. You have been plea&s;ed to take very favourable notice of our &s;ervants&mdash;They <HI>are</HI> good, and &s;en&s;ible. What reverence for him, and joy for their young mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;ake, &s;hone in their countenances as they attended!</P>
<P>My cou&s;in James, who has never been out of Eng|land, was very curious to be informed of the manners, cu&s;toms, diver&s;ions, of the people in different coun|tries&mdash;Italy, in particular&mdash;Ah the dear Clementina! What abatement from recollection! <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The &s;ighing heart,'</Q> I remember he &s;ays, in one of his Letters to Dr. Bartlett, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'will remind us of imperfection, in the highe&s;t of our enjoyments.</Q>' And he adds, <Q REND="inline">'It is fit it &s;hould be &s;o.'</Q> And on what occa&s;ion did he write this?&mdash;O my Charlotte, <HI>I</HI> was the occa&s;ion! It was in kind remembrance of me! He could not, at that time, have &s;o written, had he been indifferent, even then, to your Harriet.</P>
<P>I am &s;o apprehen&s;ive of my uncle's after remarks, that I am half-afraid to look at Sir Charles: And he mu&s;t by-and-by return to this wicked inn&mdash;They wonder at my frequent ab&s;ences. It is to oblige you, Lady G. and indeed my&s;elf: There is va&s;t plea&s;ure in communicating one's plea&s;ures to a friend who inte|re&s;ts her&s;elf, as you do, in one's deare&s;t concerns.</P>
<P>YOU know and admire my grandmamma's chearful compliances with the innocent diver&s;ions of youth: She made Lucy give us a le&s;&s;on on the harp&s;ichord, on purpo&s;e, I &s;aw, to draw me in. We both obeyed.</P>
<P>I was once a little out in an Italian &s;ong. In what a &s;weet manner did he put me in&punc; touching the keys
<PB N="75" REF="76">
him&s;elf, for a minute or two. Every one wi&s;hed him to proceed; but he gave up to me, in &s;o polite a man|ner, that we all were &s;atisfied with his excu&s;es.</P>
<P>My poor cou&s;in Jemmy is on a &s;udden very earne&s;t to go abroad; as if, &s;illy youth, travelling would make him a Sir Charles Grandi&s;on!</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t a&s;ked your brother, If all is over be|tween Mr. Greville and him? He &s;ays, He hopes and believes &s;o. God &s;end it may; or I &s;hall hate that Greville!</P>
<P>MY uncle, Mr. Deane, and my cou&s;in James, were too much taken with Sir Charles, to think of with|drawing, as it might have been expected they would; and after &s;ome general conver&s;ation, that &s;ucceeded our playing, Sir Charles drew his chair between my grandmamma and aunt, and taking my grandmam|ma's hand, May I not be allowed a quarter of an hour's conver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Byron in your pre&s;ence, La|dies? &s;aid he, &s;peaking low. We have indeed only friends and relations pre&s;ent: But it will be mo&s;t a|greeable, I believe, to the dear Lady, that what I have to &s;ay to her, and to you, may be rather reported <HI>to</HI> the gentlemen, than heard <HI>by</HI> them.</P>
<P>By all means, Sir Charles, &s;aid my grandmamma. Then whi&s;pering to my aunt, No man in this com|pany <HI>thinks,</HI> but Sir Charles. Excu&s;e me my dear.</P>
<P>The moment Sir Charles applied him&s;elf in this particular manner to them, my heart, without hear|ing what he &s;aid, was at my mouth. I aro&s;e, and withdrew to the cedar-parlour, followed by Lucy and Nancy. The gentlemen, &s;eeming to recollect them|&s;elves, withdrew likewi&s;e, to another apartment. My aunt came to me&mdash;Love!&mdash;But ah! my dear, how you tremble!&mdash;You mu&s;t come with <HI>me,</HI> And then &s;he told me what he had &s;aid to my grandmamma and her.</P>
<P>I have no courage&mdash;None at all, &s;aid I, If appre|hen&s;ion,
<PB N="76" REF="77">
if timidy, be &s;igns of Love, I have them all. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on has not one.</P>
<P>Nay, my dear, &s;aid Lucy, impute not to him want of re&s;pect, I be&s;eech you.&mdash;<HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> my Lucy! What a poor word!&mdash;Had I only re&s;pect for him, we &s;hould be nearer an equality.&mdash;Has he &s;aid any-thing of La|dy Clementina?</P>
<P>Don't be &s;illy, Harriet, &s;aid my aunt. You u&s;ed to be&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>U&s;ed to be!</HI>&mdash;Ah, madam I Sir Charles's heart, at <HI>be&s;t,</HI> a divided heart! I never had a trial till now.</P>
<P>I tell you all my foibles, Lady G.</P>
<P>My aunt led me in to Sir Charles and my grand|mamma. He met me at my entrance into the room, and in the mo&s;t engaging manner, my aunt having taken her &s;eat, conducted me to a chair which happen|ed to be vacant between her and my grandmother. He took no notice of my emotion, and I the &s;ooner recovered my&s;elf, and &s;till the &s;ooner, as he him&s;elf &s;eemed to be in &s;ome little confu&s;ion. However, he &s;at down, and with a manly, yet re&s;pectful air, his voice gaining &s;trength as he proceeded, thus deliver|ed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Never, Ladies, was man more particularly circum|&s;tanced than he before you. You know my &s;tory: You know what once were the difficulties of my &s;ituation with a family that I mu&s;t ever re&s;pect; with a Lady of it whom I mu&s;t ever revere: And you, madam (to my grandmamma) have had the good|ne&s;s to &s;ignify to me, in a mo&s;t engaging manner, that Mi&s;s Byron has added to the innumerable in&s;tances which &s;he has given me of her true greatne&s;s of mind, a <HI>kind,</HI> and even a <HI>friendly</HI> concern for a Lady who is the Mi&s;s Byron of Italy. I a&s;k not excu&s;e for the compari&s;on. The heart of the man before you, ma|dam (to me) in &s;incerity and frankne&s;s emulates your own.&mdash;</P>
<P>You want not excu&s;e, Sir, &s;aid my grandmamma&mdash;
<PB N="77" REF="78">
We all reverence Lady Clementina: We admire her.</P>
<P>He bowed to <HI>each</HI> of us; as my aunt and I looked I believe, a&s;&s;entingly to what my grandmamma &s;aid. He proceeded:</P>
<P>Yet in &s;o particular a &s;ituation, altho' what I have to &s;ay, may, I pre&s;ume, be collected from what you know of my &s;tory; and tho' my humble appli|cation to Mi&s;s Byron for her favour, and to you, La|dies, for your intere&s;t with her, have not been di&s;|couraged; &s;omething, however, may be nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid, in this audience, of the &s;tate of my own heart, for the &s;ake of this dear Lady's delicacy, and yours. And I will deliver my&s;elf with all the truth and plain|ne&s;s which I think are required in treaties of this na|ture, equally with tho&s;e &s;et on foot between nation and nation.</P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible to Beauty: But the beauty of per&s;on <HI>only,</HI> never yet had power over more than my eye; to which it gave a plea&s;ure like that which it re|ceives from the flowers of a gay parterre. Had <HI>not</HI> my heart been out of the reach of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> attractions, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf; and had I been my own ma&s;ter; Mi&s;s Byron, in the fir&s;t hour that I &s;aw her (for her beauty &s;uffered not by her di&s;tre&s;s) would have left me no other choice: But when I had the honour of conver&s;ing with her, I ob&s;erved in her mind and behaviour that true dignity, delicacy, and noble frank|ne&s;s, which I ever thought characteri&s;tic in the Sex, but never met with, in equal degree, but in <HI>one</HI> Lady. I &s;oon found, that my admiration of her fine qualities was likely to lead me into a gentler, yet a more irre|&s;i&s;table pa&s;&s;ion: For of the Lady abroad I then could have no rea&s;onable, at lea&s;t, no <HI>probable</HI> hope: Yet were there circum&s;tances between her and me, which I thought, in &s;trict ju&s;tice, obliged me to attend the i&s;&s;ue of certain events.</P>
<P>I called my&s;elf therefore to account, and was
<PB N="78" REF="79">
alarmed when I found that Mi&s;s Byron's graces had &s;tolen &s;o imperceptibly on my heart, as already to have made an impre&s;&s;ion on it too deep for my tranquillity. I determined therefore, in honour, in ju&s;tice, to both Ladies, to endeavour to re&s;train a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o new, yet likely to be &s;o &s;ervent.</P>
<P>I had avocations in town, while Mi&s;s Byron was with my &s;i&s;ters in the country. Almo&s;t afraid of tru&s;t|ing my&s;elf in her pre&s;ence, I pur&s;ued the <HI>more</HI> will-ingly tho&s;e avocations in per&s;on, when I could have managed &s;ome of them, perhaps, near as well by other hands. Compa&s;&s;ion for the one Lady, becau&s;e of her calamity, might, at that time, I found, have been made to give way, <HI>could tho&s;e calamities have been o|vercome,</HI> to Love for the other. Nor was it difficult for me to ob&s;erve, that my &s;i&s;ters and Lord L. who knew nothing of my &s;ituation, would have cho&s;en for a &s;i&s;ter the young Lady pre&s;ent, before every other woman.</P>
<P>Sometimes, I will own to you, I was ready, from that &s;elf-partiality and vanity which is too natural to men of vivacity and &s;trong hopes, to flatter my&s;elf, that I might, <HI>by my &s;i&s;ters intere&s;t,</HI> have made my&s;elf, <HI>not unacceptable</HI> to a Lady, who &s;eemed to be wholly di&s;engaged in her affections: But I would not permit my&s;elf to dwell on &s;uch hopes: Every look of com|plai&s;ance, every &s;mile, which u&s;ed to beam over that lovely countenance, I attributed to her natural good|ne&s;s, and frankne&s;s of heart, and to that grateful &s;pirit which made her over-rate a common &s;ervice that I had been &s;o happy as to render her. Had I even been free, I &s;hould have been careful not to deprive my&s;elf of that animating &s;un&s;hine, by a too early declaration. For well did I know, by <HI>other</HI> mens experience, that Mi&s;s Byron, at the &s;ame time that her natural polite|ne&s;s, and &s;weetne&s;s of manners, engaged every heart, was not, however, ea&s;ily to be won.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding all my efforts to prevent a
<PB N="79" REF="80">
competition which had grown &s;o fa&s;t upon me, I &s;till found my unea&s;ine&s;s increa&s;e with my affection for Mi&s;s Byron. I had then but one way left&mdash;It was, to &s;trengthen my heart, in Clementina's cau&s;e, by Mi&s;s Byron's a&s;&s;i&s;tance: In &s;hort, to acquaint Mi&s;s Byron with my &s;ituation; to engage her genero&s;ity for Clementina, and thereby deprive my&s;elf of the encouragement my fond heart might have hoped for, had I indulged my wi&s;hes of obtaining her favour. My end was an&s;wered, as to the latter. Mi&s;s By|ron's genero&s;ity was engaged for the Lady; but was it po&s;&s;ible that my obligations to her for that genero&s;i|ty &s;hould not add to my admiration of her?</P>
<P>At the time I laid before her my &s;ituation (it was in Lord L's Study at Colnebrooke) &s;he &s;aw my emotion. I could not conceal it. My abrupt departure from her, mu&s;t convince her, that my heart was too much engaged for that &s;ituation <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. III. p. 193,</NOTE>. I de&s;ired Dr. Bartlett to take an airing with me, in hopes, by his coun&s;els, to compo&s;e my di&s;ordered &s;pirits <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 194,</NOTE>. He knew the &s;tate of my heart: He knew, with regard to the pro|po&s;als I had formerly made to the family at Bologna, relating to Religion and Re&s;idence (as I had al&s;o de|clared to the brothers of the Lady) that no worldly grandeur &s;hould ever have induced me to allow, in a <HI>beginning</HI> addre&s;s, the terms, I was willing, as a com|promi&s;e, to allow to that Lady; for thoroughly had I weighed the inconveniencies which mu&s;t attend &s;uch an alliance: The Lady zealous in her Religion; the Confel&s;or who was to be allowed her, equally zealous; the &s;pirit of making pro&s;elytes &s;o &s;trong, and held by Roman Catholics to be &s;o meritorious; and my&s;elf no le&s;s in earne&s;t in my Religion; I had no doubt to pronounce, I told the good Doctor, in confidence, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that I &s;hould be much more happy in marriage with the Lady of Selby-hou&s;e, were &s;he to be induced to
<PB N="80" REF="81">
honour me with her hand, than it was po&s;&s;ible I could be with Lady Clementina, even were they to comply with the conditions I had propo&s;ed; as I doubted not but that Lady would <HI>al&s;o</HI> be, were her health re&s;tored, with a man of her own nation and Religion:'</Q> And I owned to him, be&s;ides, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that I could have no hope of conquering the oppo&s;ition given me by the friends of Clementina; and that I could not at times but think hardly of the indigni|ties ca&s;t upon me by &s;ome of them.'</Q></P>
<P>The doctor, I knew, at the &s;ame time that he la|mented the evil treatment Clementina met with from her mi&s;taken friends, and her unhappy malady; and admired her for her manifold excellencies; next to adored Mi&s;s Byron: And he gave his voice accord|ingly. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But here, doctor, is the ca&s;e, &s;aid I&mdash;Cle|mentina is a woman with whom I had the honour of being acquainted before I knew Mi&s;s Byron: Cle|mentina has infinite merits: She her&s;elf refu&s;ed me not: <HI>She</HI> con&s;ented to accept of the terms I offered: She even be&s;ought her friends to comply with them. She has an opinion of my honour, and of my ten|derne&s;s for her. Till I had the happine&s;s of know|ing Mi&s;s Byron, I was determined to await either her recovery or relea&s;e; and will Mi&s;s Byron her|&s;elf, if &s;he knows that, forgive me (the circum|&s;tances not changed) for the change of a re&s;olution of which Clementina was &s;o worthy? The treat|ment the poor Lady has met with, <HI>for my &s;ake,</HI> as once &s;he wrote, tho' virgin mode&s;ty induced her to cro&s;s out tho&s;e words, has heightened her di&s;order.

And if not, mu&s;t I not be as ungrateful to her, as ungenerous to the other?&mdash;Mi&s;s Byron's happine&s;s cannot depend on <HI>me.</HI> She <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be happy in the happine&s;s &s;he will give to the man of her choice, <HI>whoever</HI> &s;hall be the man!'</Q></P>
<P>We were all &s;ilent. My grandmamma and aunt &s;eemed determined to be &s;o; and I <HI>could</HI> not &s;peak. He proceeded:</P>
<P>You know not, dear Mi&s;s Byron, I wi&s;hed you <HI>not</HI> to know, the conflicts my mind laboured with, when I parted with you on my going abroad. My de&s;tiny was wrapt up in doubt, and uncertainty. I was in|vited over: Signor Jeronymo was deemed irrecover|able: He wi&s;hed to &s;ee me, and de&s;ired but to <HI>live</HI> to &s;ee me. My pre&s;ence was reque&s;ted as a la&s;t effort to recover his noble &s;i&s;ter. You your&s;elf, madam, ap|plauded my re&s;olution to go: But, that I might not be thought to wi&s;h to engage you in my favour (&s;o cir|cum&s;tanced as I was, that to have done &s;o, would have been to have acted unworthily to <HI>both</HI> Ladies,) I in&s;inuated my hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of ever being nearer to you than I was.</P>
<P>I was not able to take a formal leave of you. I went over. Succe&s;s attended the kind, the &s;oothing treatment which Clementina met with from her friends. Succe&s;s al&s;o attended the means u&s;ed for the recovery of the noble Jeronymo. Conditions were again pro|po&s;ed. Clementina, on her re&s;toration, &s;hone upon us all even with a brighter lu&s;tre than &s;he did before her di&s;order. All her friends con&s;ented to reward with the hand of their beloved daughter, the man to whom they attributed &s;econdarily the good they rejoiced in. I own to you, Ladies, that what was before <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> now became <HI>admiration;</HI> and I &s;hould have been unju&s;t to the merits of &s;o excellent a wo|man, if I could not &s;ay, <HI>Love.</HI> I concluded my&s;elf al|ready the hu&s;band of Clementina; yet it would have
<PB N="82" REF="83">
been &s;trange, if the welfare and happine&s;s of Mi&s;s By|ron were not the next wi&s;h of my heart. I rejoiced that (de&s;pairing as I did of &s;uch an event before I went over, becau&s;e of the articles of Religion and Re&s;i|dence) I had not &s;ought to engage more than her friend&s;hip; and I devoted my&s;elf wholly to Clemen|tina&mdash;<HI>I own it, Ladies</HI>&mdash;And had I thought, Angel as &s;he came out, upon proof, that I could not have given her my heart, I had been equally unju&s;t, and ungrateful. For, dear Ladies, if you know all her &s;tory, you mu&s;t know, that occa&s;ion called her out to act gloriou&s;ly; and that gloriou&s;ly &s;he an&s;wered the call.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed. We were &s;till &s;ilent. My grand|mamma and aunt looked at each other by turns. But their eyes, as well as mine, at different parts of his &s;peech &s;hewed their &s;en&s;ibility. He proceeded, grace|fully looking down, and at fir&s;t with &s;ome little he&s;i|tation.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, it was with a very ill grace, that, <HI>re|fu&s;ed,</HI> as I mu&s;t in ju&s;tice call it, tho' on the noble&s;t motives, by Clementina, I come to offer my&s;elf, and &s;o &s;oon after her refu&s;al, to a Lady of Mi&s;s Byron's delicacy. I &s;hould certainly have acted more laudably, re&s;pecting my own character <HI>only,</HI> had I taken at lea&s;t the u&s;ual time of a <HI>Widower-Love.</HI> But great minds, &s;uch as Mi&s;s Byron's, and yours, Ladies, are above common forms, where decorum is not too much ne|glected. As to my&s;elf, what do I, but declare a pa&s;|&s;ion, that would have been, but for one ob&s;tacle, which is now removed, as &s;ervent as man ever knew? Dr. Bartlett has told me, madam <HI>[to me],</HI> that you and my &s;i&s;ters have &s;een the Letters I wrote to him from Italy: By the contents of &s;ome of tho&s;e, and of the Letters I left with <HI>you,</HI> madam <HI>[to my grand|mamma],</HI> you have &s;een Clementina's con&s;tant ad|herence to the &s;tep &s;he &s;o greatly took. In this Let|ter, received but la&s;t Wedne&s;day [taking one out of
<PB N="83" REF="84">
his bo&s;om], you will &s;ee (my la&s;t Letters to them un|received, as they mu&s;t be) that I am urged by all her family, for the &s;ake of &s;etting <HI>her</HI> an example, to ad|dre&s;s my&s;elf to a Lady of my own country. This <HI>impels</HI> me, as I may &s;ay, to <HI>accelerate</HI> the humble ten|der of my vows to you, madam. However ha&s;ty the &s;tep may be thought, in my &s;ituation; Would not an inexcu&s;able neglect, or &s;eeming indifference, as if I were balancing as to the per&s;on, have been attributable to me, had I, for <HI>dull</HI> and <HI>cold</HI> form's &s;ake, been ca|pable of po&s;tponing the declaration of my affection to Mi&s;s Byron? And if, madam, you can &s;o far get over ob&s;ervances, which perhaps, on con&s;ideration, will be found to be punctilious only, as to give your heart, with your hand, to a man who him&s;elf has been per|plexed by what &s;ome would call (particular as it &s;ounds) a <HI>double Love</HI> (an embarra&s;ment, however, not of his own &s;eeking, or which he could po&s;&s;ibly avoid) you will lay him under obligation to your goodne&s;s (to your magnanimity, I will call it) which all the affec|tionate tenderne&s;s of my life to come will never en|able me to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>He then put the Letter (a tran&s;lation of it inclo&s;ed) into my hand. I have already an&s;wered it, madam, &s;aid he, and acquainted my friend, that I have actually tendered my&s;elf to the acceptance of a Lady worthy of a &s;i&s;terly relation to their Clementina; and have not been rejected. Your goodne&s;s mu&s;t enable me (I humbly hope it will) to give them &s;till &s;tronger a&s;|&s;urances of your favour: On my happine&s;s they have the genero&s;ity to build a part of their own.</P>
<P>Not well before, I was more than once apprehen|&s;ive of fainting, as he talked, agreeable as was his talk, and engaging as was his manner. My grand|mamma and aunt &s;aw my complexion change at his particular addre&s;s to me, in the la&s;t part of his &s;peech. Each put her kind hand on one of mine, and held it on it, as my other hand held my handkerchief now
<PB N="84" REF="85">
to my eyes, and now as a cover to my &s;elf-felt vary|ing cheek.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame moment that he cea&s;ed &s;peaking, he took our triply-united hands in both his; and in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful, yet graceful manner, his Letter laid in my lap, pre&s;&s;ed each of the three with his lips; mine twice. I could not &s;peak. My grandmamma and aunt, delighted, yet tears &s;tanding in their eyes, looked upon each other, and upon me; each as expecting the other to &s;peak. I have perhaps, &s;aid he, with &s;ome emotion, taken up too much of Mi&s;s Byron's attention on this my fir&s;t per&s;onal declaration: I will now return to the company below. To-morrow I will do my&s;elf the honour to dine with you. We will for this evening po&s;tpone the important &s;ubject. Mi&s;s Byron, I pre&s;ume, will be be&s;t plea&s;ed to have it &s;o. I &s;hall to-morrow be favoured with the re&s;ult of your deliberations. Mean time may I meet with an inter|ceding friend in every one I have had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee this day! I mu&s;t flatter my&s;elf with the honour of Mi&s;s Byron's <HI>whole</HI> heart, as well as with the appro|bation of all her friends. I cannot be thought at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> to de&s;erve it; but it &s;hall be the endeavour of my life &s;o to do.</P>
<P>He withdrew, with a grace which was all his own.</P>
<P>The moment he was gone from us, my grand|mamma threw her arms about her Harriet, then about my aunt; and they congratulated me, and each other.</P>
<P>We were all pained at heart, when we read the Let|ter. It is from Signor Jeronymo, urging your bro|ther to &s;et the example to his &s;i&s;ter, which they &s;o much want her to follow. I &s;end you the tran&s;lation. Pray return it. Poor Lady Clementina! Without &s;eeing the la&s;t Letters he wrote to them, &s;he &s;eems to be tired into compliance. I will not &s;ay one half that is upon my mind on this occa&s;ion, as you will have the Letter before you. His la&s;t-written Letters
<PB N="85" REF="86">
will not favour her wi&s;hes. Poor Lady! Can I for|bear to pity her? And &s;till the more is &s;he to be pi|tied, as your brother's excellencies ri&s;e upon us.</P>
<P>I be&s;ought my aunt to excu&s;e me to the company.</P>
<P>Sir Charles joined his friends (HIS friends indeed they are all!) with a vivacity in his air and manner, which charmed every-body; while the &s;illy heart of your Harriet would not allow her to enter into com|pany the whole night. Indeed it wanted the induce|ment of his pre&s;ence; for, to every one's regret, he declined &s;taying &s;upper; yet my uncle put it to him&mdash;What, Sir, do you choo&s;e to &s;up at your inn? My uncle will have it, that Sir Charles <HI>looked</HI> an an&s;wer of di&s;plea&s;ure for &s;uffering him to go to it atall. My uncle is a good-natured man. He will &s;ometimes concede, when he is not convinced; and on every ap|pearance which makes for his opinion, we are &s;ure to hear of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall have an opportunity to-morrow morning early (This morning I might &s;ay) to &s;end this long Letter by a neighbour, who is obliged to ride po&s;t to town on his own affairs.</P>
<P>Had I <HI>not</HI> had this agreeable employment, re&s;t, I am &s;ure, would not have come near me. Your bro|ther, I hope, has found it. Remember, I always mean to include my dear Lady L. in this corre&s;pond|ence: Any-body el&s;e, but di&s;cretionally. My dear Ladies both, Adieu.</P>

<P>WE have at la&s;t, my Grandi&s;on, &s;ome hopes given us, that our dear Clementina will yield to our wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87">
The General, with his Lady, made us a vi&s;it from Naples, on purpo&s;e to make a deci&s;ive effort, as he called it; and vowed that he would not return till he left her in a di&s;po&s;ition to oblige us. The Bi&s;hop at one time brought the Patriarch to rea&s;on with her; who told her, that &s;he ought not to think of the veil, unle&s;s her father and mother con&s;ented to her a&s;&s;um|ing it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont was prevailed upon to favour us with her company. She declared for us: And on Thur&s;day la&s;t Clementina was &s;till harder &s;et. Her Father, Mother, the General and his Lady, the Bi|&s;hop, all came into my chamber, and &s;ent for her. She came. Then did we all &s;upplicate her to oblige us. The General was at fir&s;t tenderly urgent: The Bi&s;hop be&s;ought her: The young Marchione&s;s pre&s;&s;ed her: Her Mother took her hand between both hers, and in &s;ilent tears could only &s;igh over it: And, la&s;tly, my Father dropt down on one knee to her. My daughter, my child, &s;aid he, oblige me. Your Jero|nymo could not refrain from tears.</P>
<P>She fell on her knee&mdash;O my Father, &s;aid &s;he, ri&s;e, or I &s;hall die at your feet! Ri&s;e, my Father!</P>
<P>Not, my dear, till you con&s;ent to oblige me.</P>
<P>Grant me but a little time, my Father, my dear, my indulgent Father!</P>
<P>The General thought he &s;aw a flexibility which we had never before &s;een in her on this &s;ubject, and called upon her for her <HI>in&s;tant</HI> determination. Shall a Fa|ther kneel in vain? &s;aid he. Shall a Mother in weep|ing &s;ilence in vain entreat?&mdash;Now, my &s;i&s;ter, com|ply&mdash;or&mdash;He &s;ternly &s;topt.</P>
<P>Have patience with me, &s;aid &s;he, but till the Che|valier's next Letters come: You expect them &s;oon. Let me receive his next Letter. And putting her hand to her forehead&mdash;Ri&s;e, my Father, or I die at your feet!</P>
<P>I thought the General pu&s;hed too hard. I begged that the next Letters might be waited for.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88">
Be it &s;o, &s;aid my father, ri&s;ing, and rai&s;ing her: But whatever be the contents, remember, my deare&s;t child, that I am your Father, your indulgent Father; and oblige me.</P>
<P>My dear Clementina, &s;aid the General, will not this paternal goodne&s;s prevail upon you? Your Fa|ther, Mother, Brothers, are all ready to kneel to you; Yet are we all to be &s;lighted? And is a foreigner, an Engli&s;hman, a Heretic (great and noble as is the man; a man, too, whom you have &s;o gloriou&s;ly refu&s;ed) to be preferred to us all? Who can bear the thoughts of &s;uch a preference!</P>
<P>And remember, my Si&s;ter, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, that you already know his opinion. You have already had his advice, in the Letters he wrote to you in the month's corre&s;pondence which pa&s;&s;ed between you, before he left Italy. Think you, that the Chevalier Grandi&s;on can recede from an opinion &s;olemnly given, the circum&s;tances not having varied?</P>
<P>I have not been well. It is wicked to oppo&s;e my Father, my Mother: I cannot argue with my Brothers. I have not been well. Spare me, &s;pare me, my Lords, to the General and the Bi&s;hop. My Father gives me time: Don't <HI>you</HI> deny it me.</P>
<P>My mother, afraid of renewing her di&s;order, &s;aid; Withdraw, my dear, if you choo&s;e to do &s;o, and compo&s;e your&s;elf: The intention is not to compel, but to per&s;uade you.</P>
<P>O madam! &s;aid &s;he, per&s;ua&s;ion &s;o &s;trongly urged by my parents, is <HI>more</HI> than compul&s;ion.&mdash;I take the liberty you give me.</P>
<P>She hurried to Mrs. Beaumont, and, throwing her arms about her, O madam, I have been oppre&s;&s;ed! Oppre&s;&s;ed by per&s;ua&s;ion! By a kneeling Father! By a weeping Mother! By entreating Brothers!&mdash;And this is but per&s;ua&s;ion!&mdash;Cruel per&s;ua&s;ion!</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont then entered into argument with her. She repre&s;ented to her the General's inflexibility:
<PB N="88" REF="89">
Her Father's and Mother's indulgence: The wi&s;hes of her two other Brothers: She pleaded your opinion given as an impartial man, not merely as a Prote&s;tant: She told her of an admirable young Lady of your own country, who was qualified to make you happy: of whom &s;he had heard &s;everal of your countrymen &s;peak with great di&s;tinction. This la&s;t plea, as the intimate friend&s;hip between you and Mrs. Beaumont is &s;o well known, took her attention. She would not for the world &s;tand in the way of the Chevalier Grandi&s;on. She wi&s;hed you to be happy, &s;he &s;aid, whatever be|came of her. Father Mare&s;cotti &s;trongly enforced this point; and advi&s;ed her to come to &s;ome re&s;olu|tion, <HI>before</HI> your next Letters arrived, as it was not to be doubted, but the contents of them would &s;upport your former opinion. The Patriarch's arguments were re-urged with additional force. A day was named when &s;he was again to be brought before her a&s;&s;embled friends. Mrs. Beaumont applauded her for the magnanimity &s;he had already &s;hewn, in the di&s;|charge of her fir&s;t duty; and called upon her to di&s;|tingui&s;h her&s;elf equally in the filial.</P>
<P>Clementina took time to con&s;ider of the&s;e and other arguments; and after three hours pa&s;&s;ed in her clo&s;et, &s;he gave the following written paper to Mrs. Beau|mont; which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he hoped, when read in full a&s;&s;embly, would excu&s;e her from attending her friends in the propo&s;ed congre&s;s.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I Am tired out, my dear <HI>Mrs. Beaumont,</HI> with your kindly-meant importunities:</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O my <HI>mamma,</HI> how well do you de&s;erve even im|plicit obedience, from a daughter who has over|clouded your happy days!

<P><PB N="89" REF="90">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But who can with&s;tand a <HI>kneeling</HI> Father? Indeed my pappa, ever good, ever indulgent, I dread to &s;ee you! Let me not again behold you as on Thur&s;day la&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I have denied to my &s;elf, and <HI>&s;uch</HI> the motive, that I mu&s;t not, I do not repent it, the man I e&s;teemed. I never can be his.</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I am ab&s;olutely forbidden to think of atoning for my fault by the only mea&s;ure that, in my opinion, could have done it.</Q></P>

<P>How did we congratulate our&s;elves, when we read this paper, faint as are the hopes it gives us!</P>
<P>Our whole endeavour is now, to treat her with tender ob&s;ervance, that &s;he may not think of receding. Nor will we a&s;k her to &s;ee the per&s;on &s;he knows we favour, till we can a&s;&s;ure her, that you will &s;et her the example. And if there be a Lady with whom you think you could be happy, may not this, my dear Grandi&s;on, pleaded by you, be a motive with her?</P>
<P>The Count of Belvedere has made overtures to us, which are too great for our acceptance, were this al|liance to take place. We have been told, but not by him&s;elf, the danger to which his di&s;pair had &s;ubjected him, in more than one vi&s;it to you at Bologna, had you not borne with his ra&s;hne&s;s. You know him to be a man of probity, of piety. He is a zealous Ca|tholic; and you mu&s;t allow, that a religious zeal is a &s;trengthener, a confirmer, of all the &s;ocial &s;anctions. He is learned; and, being a dome&s;tic man, he, con|trary to the Italian cu&s;tom, admires in a wife tho&s;e in|tellectual improvements which make a woman a fit companion for her hu&s;band. You know how much the Marchione&s;s excells almo&s;t all the women of qua|lity in Italy, in a ta&s;te for polite literature: You know &s;he has encouraged the &s;ame ta&s;te in her daughter; and the Count con&s;iders her as the only woman in Italy with whom he can be happy.</P>
<P>As you, my Grandi&s;on, cannot now be my bro|ther by marriage, the Count of Belvedere is the only man in the world I can wi&s;h to be &s;o. He is of Italy. My &s;i&s;ter, always &s;o dear to us, and he, will be ever
<PB N="91" REF="92">
with us, or we with them. He knows the unhappy way &s;he has been in; and was &s;o far from making that an objection, that when her malady was at the height (being ecouraged by phy&s;icians to hope that her recovery would be the probable con&s;equence) he would have thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t of men, could he have been honoured with her hand. He knows her Love of you. He adores her for her mo|tive of refu&s;ing you. He loves you; and is confident of the inviolable honour of both: Who&s;e alliance, on all the&s;e con&s;iderations, can be &s;o de&s;irable to us as that with the Count of Belvedere?</P>
<P>Surely, my dear friend, it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be in your power to &s;et the example: In <HI>yours,</HI> who could &s;ubdue a whole family of zealous Catholics, and keep your own religion; and who could engage the virgin heart of one of the mo&s;t delicate women in the world. What woman, who has a heart to be&s;tow; what family, that has a daughter or &s;i&s;ter to give, can with&s;tand you? Religion and Country of both the &s;ame?</P>
<P>Give us hope, therefore, my dear Grandi&s;on, that you will make the effort. A&s;&s;ure us, that you will not &s;cruple, if you can &s;ucceed, to &s;et the example: and on this a&s;&s;urance we will claim from Clementina the effects of the hope &s;he has given us: And if we <HI>can</HI> prevail. will in England return you thanks for the numberle&s;s favours you have conferred upon us.</P>
<P>Thus earne&s;tly, as well from inclination, as in compliance with the pre&s;&s;ing entreaties of every one of a family which I hope are &s;till, and ever, will be, dear to you, do I, your Jeronymo, your Brother, your Friend, &s;olicit you. Mrs. Beaumont joins with us. She &s;cruples not, &s;he bids me tell you, to pro|nounce, that you and Clementina will both be more happy; &s;he, with the Count of Belvidere (your re|&s;pective Countries &s;o di&s;tant, your Religion &s;o differ|ent); you, with an Engli&s;hwoman; than you could have been with each other. Mrs. Beaumont has
<PB N="92" REF="93">
owned to me in private, that you often in conver&s;a|tion with her, even while you had hope of calling Clementina yours, lamented, for her &s;ake, as well as your own, the unhappy &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to Re|ligion, you were both in; and that you had declared more than once to her, as indeed you did once to us, that in a <HI>beginning</HI> addre&s;s you would not have com|promi&s;ed thus with a Prince&s;s.

We hone&s;t folks, who have not abundance of Love-fooling upon our hands, find our&s;elves happy in a good deal of quiet lei&s;ure; and I love to chide and correct you wi&s;e ones.&mdash;Thus then I begin&mdash;</P>
<P>Ridiculous parade among you! I blame you all. Could he not have been Mrs. Shirley's gue&s;t, if he was not to be permitted to repo&s;e under the &s;ame roof with his &s;overeign Lady and Mi&s;tre&s;s? But mu&s;t you let him go to an inn?&mdash;What for? Why to &s;hew the world he was but on a foot, at pre&s;ent, with your other humble &s;ervants; and be <HI>thought</HI> no more, by the in&s;olent Greville, and affronted as an invader of his rights. Our Sex is a fooli&s;h Sex: Too little or too much parade. Lord help us! Were it not that
<PB N="93" REF="94">
we mu&s;t be afraid to appear over-forward to the man <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> the world is a contemptible thing, and we &s;hould treat it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>And yet, after all, what with Lady Clementina, what with the world, and what with our own puncti|lio, and palpitating hearts, and-&s;o-forth, and all that, and more than all that; I own you are pretty nicely circum&s;tanced. But, my life for yours, you will be|have like a &s;impleton, on occa&s;ion of his next addre&s;s to you: And why? Did you ever know that people did not, who are full of apprehen&s;ions, who aimed at being very delicate, who were &s;olicitous to take their mea&s;ures from the judgment of tho&s;e without them; pragmatical &s;ouls, perhaps, who from their no|tions either on what they have <HI>read,</HI> or by the ad|dre&s;&s;es to them of their own &s;illy fellows, aukward and unmeaning, and by no means to be compared, for integrity, under&s;tanding, politene&s;s, to my bro|ther? Con&s;ider, child, that he having &s;een, in differ|ent countries, perhaps a hundred women, equally &s;pe|cious with the pre&s;ent mi&s;tre&s;s of his de&s;tiny, were form and outward grace to be the attractives, is <HI>there&mdash;fore</HI> &s;itter to <HI>give</HI> than <HI>take</HI> the example.</P>
<P>But, Harriet, I write to charge you not to increa&s;e your own difficulties by too much parade: Your frankne&s;s of heart is a prime con&s;ideration with him. He expects not to meet with the <HI>girl,</HI> but the <HI>&s;en&s;ible woman,</HI> in his addre&s;s to you. He is pur&s;uing a laud|able end&mdash;Don't teaze him with pug's tricks&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'What, &s;ignifies a&s;king me now?'</Q> Did you not lay your heads together? And the wi&s;e&s;t which ever were &s;et on wo|mens &s;houlders? But indeed I never knew con&s;ulta|tions of any kind turn to account. It is only a parcel of people getting together, propo&s;ing doubts, and puzzling one another, and ending as they began, if not wor&s;e. Doctors differ. So many per&s;ons, &s;o many minds.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="95">
And O how our petulant heart throbbed with indig|nation, becau&s;e he came not to breakfa&s;t with you! What benefit has a polite man over an unpolite one, where the latter &s;hall have his ru&s;ticity allowed for <HI>(O that is his way!)</HI> and when the other has expectations drawn upon him, which, if not <HI>critically</HI> an&s;wered, he is not to be forgiven!&mdash;He is a <HI>prudent</HI> man! He may have <HI>over&s;lept</HI> him&s;elf&mdash;Might dream of <HI>Clemen|tina.</HI> Then it was a fault in him, that he &s;tayed to dine on the road&mdash;His hor&s;es might want re&s;t, truly&punc;&mdash;Upon my word, Harriet, a woman in Love, is&mdash;a woman in Love.

Yet I am &s;o true to the Free-ma&s;onry my&s;elf, that I would think the man who &s;hould dare to &s;ay half I have written, of our <HI>Doll&s;hips,</HI> ought not to go away with his life.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter and I are troubled about this Greville. In|form us, the moment you can, of the particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed between my brother and him; pray do. We long al&s;o to &s;ee the Letter he has put into your hands, from Bologna. It is on the road, we hope.</P>
<P>Caroline and I are as much concerned for your ho|nour, your punctilio, as you, or any of you, can be. But by the account you give me of my brother's addre&s;s to you in pre&s;ence of your grandmother and aunt, as well as from our knowledge of his politene&s;s, neither you nor we need to trouble our heads about it: It may be all left to him. He knows &s;o well what be|comes the character of the woman whom he hopes to call his wife, that you will be &s;ure of your dignity being pre&s;erved, if you place a confidence in him. And yet no man is &s;o much above mere formal re|gards as he is. Let me enumerate in&s;tances, from your Letter before me.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96">
His own intention, in the fir&s;t place, not to &s;ur|pri&s;e you by his vi&s;its, as you apprehended he would, which would have made him look like a man of &s;elf|imagined con&s;equence to you&mdash;His providing him&s;elf with accommodations at an inn; and not giving way to the invitation, even of your <HI>&s;agacious</HI> uncle Selby [I mu&s;t raily him. Does he &s;pare me?]&mdash;His &s;ingling you out on Friday from your men-friends, yet giving you the opportunity of your aunt's and grandmother's company, to make his per&s;onal application to you for your favour&mdash;His reque&s;ting the intere&s;t of your other friends with you, as if he pre&s;umed not on your for|mer acquaintance, and this after an application, not di&s;couraged, made to your friends and you.</P>
<P>As to his equanimity in his fir&s;t addre&s;s to you; his retaining your hand, for&s;ooth, before all your friends, and &s;o-forth; never find fault with that, Ha|riet. [Indeed you do make an excu&s;e for the very freedom you blame&mdash;So Lover-like!&mdash;] He is the very man, that a con&s;cious young woman, as you are, &s;hould wi&s;h to be addre&s;&s;ed by: So much courage, yet &s;o much true mode&s;ty&mdash;What, I warrant, you would have had a man chalked out for you&punc; who &s;hould have &s;tood at di&s;tance, bowed, &s;craped, tremb|led; while you had nothing to do, but bridle, and make &s;tiff courte&s;ies to him, with your hands before you&mdash;Plagued with <HI>his</HI> doubts, and with <HI>your can</HI> di&s;&s;idences; afraid he would <HI>now,</HI> and <HI>now,</HI> and <HI>now,</HI> pop out the que&s;tion; which he had not the cour|age to put; and &s;o running on, &s;impering, fretting, fearing, two parrallel lines, &s;ide by &s;ide, and never meeting; till &s;ome interpo&s;ing friends, in pity to you both, put one's head pointing to the other's head, and &s;troking and clapping the &s;houlder of each, &s;et you at each other, as men do by other dunghil-bred creatures.</P>
<P>You own, he took no notice of your emotion, when he fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to you; &s;o gave you
<PB N="96" REF="97">
an opportunity to look up, which otherwi&s;e you would have wanted. Now don't you think you know a man creature or two, who would on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion, have grinned you quite out of countenance, and in&s;ulted you with their pity for being mode&s;t?&mdash;But you own, that he had emotion too, when he fir&s;t opened his mind to you&mdash;What a duce would the girl have?&mdash;Orme and Fowler in your head, no doubt! The tremblings of rejected men, and the phanta&s;ies of romantic women, were to be a rule to my brother, I &s;uppo&s;e with your mock-maje&s;ty!&mdash;Ah, Harriet! Did I not &s;ay that we women are very &s;illy creatures?&mdash;But my brother is a <HI>good</HI> man&mdash;So we mu&s;t have &s;ome|thing to find fault with him for.&mdash;Hah, hah, hah, hah, What do you laugh at, Charlotte?&mdash;What do I laugh at, Harriet?&mdash;Why, at the idea of a couple of <HI>Love|yers,</HI> taken each with a violent ague-fit, at their fir&s;t approach to each other&mdash;Hands &s;haking&mdash;Knees trem|bling&mdash;Lips quivering&mdash;Tongue faultering&mdash;Teeth chattering&mdash;I had a good mind to pre&s;ent you with an ague-dialogue between &s;uch a trembling couple.&mdash;I, I, I, I, &s;ays the Lover&mdash;You, you, you, you, &s;ays the girl, if able to &s;peak at all. But, Harriet, you &s;hall have the whole, on demand. Rave at me, if you will: But Love, as it is called by boys and girls, &s;hall ever be the &s;ubject of my ridicule. Does it not lead us girls into all manner of ab&s;urdities, inconvenien|cies, undutifulne&s;s, di&s;grace?&mdash;Villainous Cupidity!&mdash;It does.</P>
<P>To be &s;erious&mdash;Neither does my brother addre&s;s you in a &s;tile that impeaches either his own under|&s;tanding, or yours.&mdash;Another fault, Harriet, is it not?&mdash;But &s;ure you are not &s;o <HI>very</HI> a girl!</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice he does to Lady Clementina and her family [Let me be very &s;erious, when I &s;peak of Cle|mentina] is a glorious in&s;tance as well of his greatne&s;s of mind, as of his &s;incerity. He has no need to de|preciate one Lady, to help him to exalt (or do ju&s;tice,
<PB N="97" REF="98">
I &s;hould rather &s;ay, to) another. By prai&s;ing her, he makes noble court to you, in &s;uppo&s;ing you, as you are, one of the mo&s;t generous of women. How great is his compliment to <HI>both</HI> Ladies, when he calls Cle|mentina the Mi&s;s Byron of Italy! Who, my dear, ever courted woman as my brother courts you? In|deed there can be but very few men who have &s;uch a woman to court.</P>
<P>He &s;uffers you not to a&s;k for an account of the &s;tate of his heart from the time he knew you fir&s;t, till now. He gives it to you, una&s;ked. And how glorious is that account, both to you, and him&s;elf!</P>
<P>Let us look back upon his conduct when la&s;t in Italy, and when every &s;tep &s;eemed to lead to his being hu&s;band of another woman.</P>
<P>The recovery of Clementina, and of her noble brother, &s;eem to be the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of his friendly goodne&s;s. The grateful family all join to reward him with their darling's hand; her heart &s;uppo&s;ed to be al|ready his. He, like the man of honour he is, con|cludes him&s;elf bound by his former offers. They ac|cept him upon tho&s;e terms. The Lady's merits thine out with tran&s;cendent lu&s;tre in the eyes of every one, even of us his &s;i&s;ters, and of <HI>you,</HI> Harriet, and your be&s;t friends: Mu&s;t they not in <HI>his,</HI> to whom <HI>Merit</HI> was ever the <HI>fir&s;t, Beauty</HI> but the <HI>&s;econd</HI> attractive? He had no tie to any other woman on earth: He had only the tenderne&s;s of his own heart, with regard to Mi&s;s Byron, to contend with. <HI>Ought</HI> he not to have contended with it? He <HI>did;</HI> and &s;o far conquered, as to enable him&s;elf to be <HI>ju&s;t</HI> to the Lady, who&s;e great qualities, and the concurrence of her friends in his favour, had converted Compa&s;&s;ion for her into Love. And who, that hear her &s;tory, can forbear to Love her? But with what tenderne&s;s, with what politene&s;s, does he, in his Letter to his cho&s;en corre&s;pondent, ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf of Mi&s;s Byron! He declares, that if <HI>&s;he</HI> were not to be happy, it would be a great abatement
<PB N="98" REF="99">
of his own felicity. You, however, remember how politely he recals his apprehen&s;ions that you may not, on his account, be altogether &s;o happy as he wi&s;hes, as the &s;ugge&s;tions of his own pre&s;umption; and cen&s;ures him&s;elf for barely &s;uppo&s;ing, that he had been of con|&s;equence enough with you to give you pain.</P>
<P>How much to your honour before he went over, does he account for your &s;miles, for yourfrankne&s;s of heart, in his company! He would not build upon them: Nor indeed could he know the &s;tate of your heart, as <HI>we</HI> did: He had not the opportunity. How &s;illy was your punctilio, that made you &s;ometimes fan&s;y it was out of mere compa&s;&s;ion that he revealed to you the &s;tate of his engagement abroad! You &s;ee he tells you, that &s;uch was his opinion of your great|ne&s;s of mind, that he thought he had no other way but to put it in your power to check him, if his Love for you &s;hould &s;timulate him to an act of neglect to the Lady to whom (&s;he having never refu&s;ed him, and not being then in a condition either to claim him or &s;et him free) he thought him&s;elf under obligation. Don't you revere him for his honour to her, the na|ture of her malady con&s;idered? What mu&s;t he have &s;uffered, in this conflict!</P>
<P>Well, and now by a &s;trange turn in the Lady, but glorious to her&s;elf, as he ob&s;erves, the ob&s;tacle re|moved, he applies to Mi&s;s Byron for her favour. How &s;en&s;ible is he of what delicacy requires from her! How ju&s;tly (re&s;pecting his Love for you) does he ac|count for not po&s;tponing, for the &s;ake of <HI>cold</HI> and <HI>dull</HI> form, as he ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;es it, his addre&s;s to you! How greatly does the Letter he delivered to you, fa|vour his argument! Ah the poor Clementina! <HI>Cruel</HI> per&s;uades her relations! I hate and pity them, in a breath. Never, before, did hatred and pity meet in the &s;ame bo&s;om, as they do in mine, on this occa&s;ion. His difficulties, my dear, and the uncommon &s;ituation he is in, as if he were offering you but a divided Love,

enhance your glory. You are rein&s;tated on the Fe|male throne, to the lowermo&s;t foot&s;tep of which you once was afraid you had de&s;cended. You are offered a man, who&s;e perplexities have not proceeded from the entanglements of intrigue, incon&s;tancy, perfidy; but from his own compa&s;&s;ionate nature: And could you, by any other way in the world than by this &s;up|po&s;ed divided Love, have had it in your power, by accepting his humbly-offered hand, to lay him under obligation to you, which he thinks he never &s;hall be able to di&s;charge? Lay <HI>him</HI>&mdash;Who?&mdash;Sir CHARLES GRANDISON&mdash;For whom &s;o many virgin hearts have &s;ighed in vain!&mdash;And what a triumph to our Sex is this, as well as to my Harriet!</P>
<P>And now, Harriet, let me tell you, that my &s;i&s;ter and I are both in great expectations of your next Let|ter. It is, it mu&s;t be, written before you will have this. My brother is more than man: You have only to &s;hew your&s;elf to be &s;uperior to the <HI>forms</HI> of woman. If you play the fool with him, now, that you have the power you and we have &s;o long wi&s;hed you; if you give pain to his noble, becau&s;e &s;incere heart, by any the lea&s;t &s;hadow of Female affectation; you, who have hitherto been di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;o amiable a frank|ne&s;s of heart; you, who cannot doubt his honour&mdash;the honour of a man who &s;olicits your favour in even a <HI>great</HI> manner, a manner in which no man before him ever courted a woman, becau&s;e few men before him have ever been &s;o particularly circum&s;tanced; a manner that gives you an opportunity to out&s;hine, in your acceptance of him, even the noble Clementina in her refu&s;al; as bigotry mu&s;t have been, in part, her motive; if, I &s;ay, you act fooli&s;hly, weakly, now&mdash;Look to it&mdash;You will depreciate, if not ca&s;t away your own glory. Remember, you have a man to deal with, who, from our behaviour to Mrs. Oldham, at his fir&s;t return to England, took mea&s;ure of our minds, and, without loving us the le&s;s for it, looked

down upon us with pity; and made us, ever &s;ince, look upon our&s;elves in a dimini&s;hing light, and as &s;i&s;ters who have greater rea&s;on to glory in their bro|ther, than he has in them. Would you not rather, you who are to &s;tand in a &s;till nearer relation to him, invite his admiration, than his pity?

<P>MR Fenwick has ju&s;t now been telling us, from the account given him by that Greville, vile man, how the affair was between him and Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. Take it briefly, as follows:</P>
<P>About Eight ye&s;terday morning, that audacious wretch went to the George at Northampton; and, after making his enquiries, demanded an audience of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. Sir Charles was near dre&s;&s;ed, and had ordered his chariot to be ready, with in|tent to vi&s;it us early.</P>
<P>He admitted of Mr. Greville's vi&s;it. Mr. Greville confe&s;&s;es, that his own behaviour was <HI>peremptory</HI> (his
<PB N="101" REF="102">
word for <HI>in&s;olent.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e). I hear, Sir, &s;aid he, that y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">u are come down into this country in order to carry off from u the riche&s;t jewel in it&mdash;I need not &s;ay whom. My name is Greville: I have long made my addre&s;&s;es to her, and have bound my&s;elf under a vow, that, were a Prince to be my competitor, I would di&s;pute his title to her.</P>
<P>You &s;eem to be a <HI>princely</HI> man, Sir, &s;aid Sir Charles, offended with his air and words, no doubt. You need not, Mr. Greville, have told me your name: I have heard of you. What <HI>your</HI> preten&s;ions are, I know not; your vow is nothing to me: I am ma&s;ter of my own actions; and &s;hall not account to you, or any man living, for them.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, Sir, you came down with the intenti|on I have hinted at? I beg only your an&s;wer as to that. I beg it a favour, gentleman to gentleman?</P>
<P>The manner of your addre&s;s to me, Sir, is not &s;uch as will intitle you to an an&s;wer for your <HI>own</HI> &s;ake. I will tell you, however, that I am come down to pay my devoirs to Mi&s;s Byron. I hope for acceptance; and know not that I am to make allowance for the claim of any man on earth.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, I know your character: I know your bravery. It is from that knowlege that I con&s;ider you as a &s;it man for me to talk to. I am not a Sir Hargrave Pollexfen, Sir.</P>
<P>I make no account of <HI>who</HI> or <HI>what</HI> you are, Mr. Greville. Your vi&s;it is not, at this time, a welcome one: I am going to breakfa&s;t with Mi&s;s Byron. I &s;hall be here in the evening, and at lei&s;ure, then, to at|tend to any-thing you &s;hall think your&s;elf authorized to &s;ay to me, on this or any other &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We may be overheard, Sir&mdash;Shall I beg you to walk with me into the garden below? You are going to breakfa&s;t, you &s;ay, with Mi&s;s Byron. <HI>Dear</HI> Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, oblige me with an audience, of five minutes only, in the back-yard, or garden.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103">
In the evening, Mr. Greville, command me any|where: But I will not be broken in upon now.</P>
<P>I will not leave you at liberty, Sir Charles, to make your vi&s;it where you are going, till I am gratified with one five minutes conference with you below.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me then, M. Greville, that I give orders, as if you were not here. Sir Charles ran. Up came one of his &s;ervants&mdash;Is the chariot ready?&mdash;Almo&s;t ready, was the an&s;wer.&mdash;Make ha&s;te. Saunders may &s;ee his friends in this neighbourhood: He may &s;tay with them till Monday. Frederick and you attend me.</P>
<P>He took out a Letter, and read in it, as he walked about the room, with great compo&s;ure, not regarding Mr. Greville, who &s;tood &s;welling, as he owned, at one of the windows, till the &s;ervant withdrew; and then he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Sir Charles in language of reproach on this contemptuous treatment.&mdash;Mr. Greville, &s;aid Sir Charles, you may be thankful, per|haps, that you are in my own apartment: This in|tru&s;ion is a very ungentlemanly one.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was angry, and expre&s;&s;ed impatience to be gone. Mr. Greville owned, that he knew not how to contain him&s;elf, to &s;ee his rival, with &s;o many advantages in his per&s;on and air, dre&s;&s;ed avowedly to attend the woman he had &s;o long&mdash;Shall I &s;ay been trouble&s;ome to? For I am &s;ure he had never the &s;ha|dow of countenance from me.</P>
<P>I repeat my demand, Sir Charles, of a conference of five minutes below.</P>
<P>You have no right to make any demand upon me, Mr. Greville: If you think you have, the evening will be time enough. But, even then, you mu&s;t be|have more like a gentleman, than you have done hi|therto, to intitle you&s;elf to be con&s;idered as on a foot with me.</P>
<P>Not on a foot with you, Sir!&mdash;And he put his hand upon his &s;word. A gentleman is on a foot with a Prince, Sir, in a point of honour&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104">
Go, then, and find out your prince, Mr. Greville: I am no Prince. And you have as much rea&s;on to addre&s;s your&s;elf to the man you never &s;aw, as to me.</P>
<P>His &s;ervant ju&s;t then &s;hewing him&s;elf, and with|drawing; Mr. Greville, added he, I leave you in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this apartment. Your &s;ervant, Sir. In the evening I &s;hall be at your command.</P>
<P>One word with you, Sir Charles&mdash;One word&mdash;</P>
<P>What would Mr. Greville? turning back.</P>
<P>Have you made propo&s;als? Are your propo&s;als ac|cepted?</P>
<P>I repeat, that you ought to have behaved differ|ently, Mr. Greville, to be intitled to an an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions.</P>
<P>An&s;wer me, however, Sir: I beg it as a favour.</P>
<P>Sir Charles took out his watch.&mdash;After Nine: I &s;hall make them wait. But thus I an&s;wer you: I <HI>have</HI> made propo&s;als; and, as I told you before, I hope I &s;hall he accepted.</P>
<P>Were you any other man in the world, Sir, the man before you might que&s;tion your &s;ucce&s;s with a woman who&s;e difficulties are augmented by the ob&s;e|quiou&s;ne&s;s of her admirers. But &s;uch a man as you, would not have come down on a fool's errand. I love Mi&s;s Byron to di&s;traction. I could not &s;hew my face in the county, and &s;uffer any man out of it to carry away &s;uch a prize.</P>
<P>Out of the county, Mr. Greville! What narrow|ne&s;s is this! But I pity you for your Love of Mi&s;s Byron: And&mdash;</P>
<P>You <HI>pity</HI> me, Sir! interrupted he.&mdash;I bear not &s;uch haughty tokens of &s;uperiority. Either give up your preten&s;ions to Mi&s;s Byron, or make me &s;en&s;ible of it, in the way of a gentleman.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, your &s;ervant: And he went down.</P>
<P>The wretch followed him; and when they came to the yard, and Sir Charles was &s;tepping into the cha|riot, he took his hand, &s;everal per&s;ons pre&s;ent&mdash;We

are ob&s;erved, Sir Charles, whi&s;pered he. Withdraw with me, for a few moments. By the great God of Heaven, you mu&s;t not refu&s;e me. I cannot bear that you &s;hould go thus triumphantly on the bu&s;ine&s;s you are going upon.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led hy the wretch: And when they were come to a private &s;pot, Mr. Gre|ville drew, and demanded Sir Charles to do the like, putting him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>Sir Charles put his hand on his &s;word, but drew it not. Mr. Greville, &s;aid he, know your own &s;afety; and was turning from him, when the wretch &s;wore he would admit of no alternative, but his giving up his preten&s;ions to Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>His rage, as Mr. Fenwick de&s;cribes it from him&s;elf, making him dangerous, Sir Charles drew.&mdash;I only defend my&s;elf, &s;aid he&mdash;Greville, you keep no guard&mdash;He put by his pa&s;s with his &s;word; and, without making a pu&s;h, clo&s;ed in with him, twi&s;ted his &s;word out of his hand; and, pointing his own to his brea&s;t, You &s;ee my power, Sir&mdash;Take your life, and your &s;word.&mdash;But if you are either wi&s;e, or would be thought a man of honour, tempt not again your fate.</P>
<P>And am I again ma&s;ter of my &s;word, and unhurt? 'Tis generous&mdash;The evening, you &s;ay?</P>
<P>Still I &s;ay, I will be yours in the evening, either at your own hou&s;e, or at my inn; but not as a Duelli&s;t, Sir: You know my principles.</P>
<P>How can this be? and he &s;wore&mdash;How was it done? Expo&s;e me not at Selby-hou&s;e. How the devil could this be?&mdash;I expect you in the evening here.</P>
<P>And he went off a back-way. Sir Charles, in&s;tead of going directly into his chariot, went up to his a|partment; wrote his Billet to my aunt to excu&s;e him&s;elf, finding it full late to get hither in time, and being &s;omewhat di&s;compo&s;ed in his temper, as he owned to us: And then he took an airing in his cha|riot, till he came hither to dine.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106">
But how &s;hould we have been alarmed, had we known that Sir Charles declined &s;upping here, in order to meet the violent man again at his inn! And how did we again blame our&s;elves for taking ami&s;s his not &s;upping with us!</P>
<P>Mr. Fenwick &s;ays, that Mr. Greville got <HI>him</HI> to ac|company him to the George.</P>
<P>Sir Charles apologized, with great civility, to Mr. Greville, for making him wait for him. Mr. Gre|ville, had he been di&s;po&s;ed for mi&s;chief, had no u&s;e of his right-arm. It was &s;prained by the twi&s;ting of his &s;word from it, and in a &s;ling.</P>
<P>Sir Charles behaved to them both with great po|litene&s;s; and Mr. Greville owned, that he had acted nobly by him, in returning his &s;word, even before his pa&s;&s;ion was calmed, and in not u&s;ing his own. But it was &s;ome time, it &s;eems, before he was brought into this temper. And what a good deal contributed to it, was, Sir Charles's acquainting him, that he had not given particulars at Selby-hou&s;e, or to any-body, of the fray between them; but referred it to him&s;elf to give them, as he &s;hould think proper. This forbear|ance he highly applauded, and was even thankful for it. Fenwick &s;hall, in confidence, &s;aid he, report this matter to your honour, and my own mortification, as the truth requires, at Selby-hou&s;e. Let me not be hated by Mi&s;s Byron, on this account. My pa&s;&s;ion gave me di&s;advantage. I will try to honour you, Sir Charles: But I mu&s;t hate you, if you &s;ucceed. One condition, however, I make: That you reconcile me to the Selbys, and Mi&s;s Byron; and if you are likely to be &s;ucce&s;sful, let me have the credit of reporting, that it is by my con&s;ent.</P>
<P>They parted with civility; but not, it &s;eems, till a late hour. Sir Charles, as Mr. Beauchamp and Dr. Bartlett have told us, was always happy in making, by his equanimity, genero&s;ity, and forgiveingne&s;s, fa&s;t
<PB N="106" REF="107">
friends of inveterate enemies. Thank God, the i&s;&s;ue was not unhappy!</P>
<P>Mr. Fenwick &s;ays, that the rencounter is very little gue&s;&s;ed at, or talked of [Thank God for that too!]; and to tho&s;e few, who have enquired of Mr. Greville or Mr. Fenwick about it, it has been denied; and now Greville, as Mr. Fenwick had done before, de|clares he will give out, that he yields up all his hopes of Mi&s;s Byron; but &s;ays, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, of who&s;e addre&s;s every-body already talks, is the only man in England to whom he could re&s;ign his preten|&s;ions.</P>
<P>He in&s;i&s;ts upon Sir Charles's dining with him to|morrow; Mr. Fenwick's al&s;o. Sir Charles is &s;o de|&s;irous that the neighbourhood &s;hould conclude, that he and the&s;e gentlemen are on a foot of good under|&s;tanding, that he made the le&s;s &s;cruple, for every-one's &s;ake, to accept of his invitation.</P>
<P>I am very, very thankful, my deare&s;t Lady G. that the con&s;tant blu&s;terings of this violent man, for &s;o many months pa&s;t, are &s;o happily overblown.</P>
<P>Mr. Fenwick, as I gue&s;&s;ed he would, made pro|po&s;als to my aunt and me for my Lucy. Lucy has a fine fortune: But if &s;he had not, he &s;hall not have her! Indeed he is not worthy of Lucy's mind. He mu&s;t be related to <HI>me,</HI> he &s;aid: But I an&s;wered, No man mu&s;t call Lucy Selby his, who can have any other motive for his wi&s;hes but her merit.</P>
<P>We hourly expect your brother. The new danger he has been in, on my account, endears him &s;till more to us all. How, how will you forbear, &s;aid my uncle, throwing your&s;elf in his arms at once, when he de|mands the re&s;ult of our deliberations? If I follow Mr. Deane's advice. I am to give him my hand at the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> word: If Lucy's and Nancy's, he is not to a&s;k me <HI>twice:</HI> If my grandmamma's and aunt's (They are always good) I am to act as occa&s;ion requires, and
<PB N="107" REF="108">
as my own confided-in prudence will &s;ugge&s;t at the time; but to be &s;ure not to be guilty of affectation. But &s;till, my dear Ladies, &s;omething &s;ticks with me (and ought it not?) in relation to the noble Clemen|tina!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday Night, Oct. <HI>14.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOW, my dear Ladies L. and G. let me lay be|fore you, ju&s;t as it happened, for your appro|bation, or cen&s;ure, all that has pa&s;&s;ed between the be&s;t of men and your Harriet. Happy &s;hall I be, If I can be acquitted by his &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>My grandmamma went home la&s;t night, but was here before Sir Charles; yet he came a little after Eleven. We were all in the great parlour when he came. He addre&s;&s;ed us &s;everally with his u&s;ual polite|ne&s;s, and my grandmother, particularly, with &s;uch an air of reverence, as did him&s;elf credit, becau&s;e of her years and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>We all congratulated him on what we had heard from Mr. Fenwick.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville and I, &s;aid he, are on every good terms. When I have the pre&s;umption to think <HI>my|&s;elf</HI> a welcome gue&s;t, I am to introduce him as my friend. Mr. Greville, tho' &s;o long your neighbour, mode&s;tly doubts his own welcome.</P>
<P>Well he may, &s;aid my aunt Selby, after&mdash;No <HI>af|ters,</HI> dear madam, if you mean any-thing that has pa&s;&s;ed between him and me.</P>
<P>He again addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me. I rejoice, Sir, &s;aid I, that you have quieted &s;o happily a &s;pirit always thought uncontroulable.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t tell me, madam, replyed he, when I can be allowed to introduce Mr. Greville to you?</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109">
Shall <HI>I</HI> an&s;wer for my cou&s;in, &s;aid Lucy?&mdash;I did not, Sir Charles, think you &s;uch a de&s;igner.&mdash;You were not, you know, to introduce Mr. Greville, till you were a&s;&s;ured of being your&s;elf a <HI>very</HI> welcome gue&s;t to my cou&s;in.</P>
<P>I own my plot, replied he: I had an intent to &s;ur|pri&s;e Mi&s;s Byron into an implied favour to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You need not, Sir Charles, thought I, take &s;uch a method.</P>
<P>On his taking very kind notice of my cou&s;in James; Do you know, Sir Charles, &s;aid my uncle (who&s;e joy, when it overflows, &s;eldom &s;uffers the dear man to con&s;ult &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s) that that boy is already in Love with your Emily?&mdash;The youth blu&s;hed&mdash;</P>
<P>I am obliged to every-body who loves my Emily. She is a favourite of Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;Mu&s;t &s;he not then be a good girl?</P>
<P>She is indeed a favourite, &s;aid I; and &s;o great a one, that I know not <HI>who</HI> can de&s;erve her.</P>
<P>I &s;aid this, le&s;t Sir Charles &s;hould think (on a &s;up|po&s;ition that my uncle meant &s;omething) that my cou&s;in had <HI>my</HI> countenance.</P>
<P>Sir Charles then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to my grand|mamma and aunt, &s;peaking low&mdash;I hope, Ladies, I may be allowed in your pre&s;ence to re&s;ume the con|ver&s;ation of ye&s;terday with Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P>No, Sir Charles, an&s;wered my grandmamma, af|fecting to look &s;erious, that mu&s;t not be.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;t not be,</HI> madam! and he &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed, and <HI>affected</HI> too. My aunt was a little &s;tartled; but not &s;o much as &s;he would have been, had &s;he not known the lively turns which that excellent parent &s;ometimes gives to &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;t not be,</HI> I repent, Sir Charles: But I will not &s;uffer you to be long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. We have always, when propo&s;als of this kind have been made, referred our&s;elves to our Harriet. She has prudence: She has gratitude. We will leave her and you together, when
<PB N="109" REF="110">
&s;he is inclined to hear you on the intere&s;ting &s;ubject. I know I am right. Harriet is above di&s;gui&s;es. She will be obliged to &s;peak for her&s;elf, when &s;he has not either her aunt or me to refer to. She and you are not acquaintance of ye&s;terday. You, Sir, I dare &s;ay, will not he di&s;plea&s;ed with the opportunity&mdash;</P>
<P>Neither Mi&s;s Byron nor I, madam, could wi&s;h for the ab&s;ence of two &s;uch parental relations. But this reference I will pre&s;ume to con&s;true as a hopeful prog|no&s;tic. May I <HI>now,</HI> through your mediation, madam <HI>(to my aunt)</HI> hope for the opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P>My aunt, taking me to the window, told me what had pa&s;&s;ed. I was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at my grand|mamma's reference to my&s;elf only. I expo&s;tulated with my aunt: It is plain&punc; madam, that Sir Charles expected not this compliment.</P>
<P>Your grandmamma's motion &s;urpri&s;ed me a little my dear: It proceeded from the fulne&s;s of her joy: She meant a compliment to you both: There is now no receding. Let us withdraw together.</P>
<P>What, madam, at <HI>his</HI> propo&s;al? As if <HI>expecting</HI> to be followed?&mdash;See how my uncle looks at me! E|very one's eyes are upon me!&mdash;In the afternoon, if it mu&s;t be&mdash;as by accident. But I had rather you and my grandmamma were to be pre&s;ent. I mean not to be guilty of affeciation to him:. I know my own heart, and will not di&s;gui&s;e it. I &s;hall <HI>want</HI> to refer to you. I &s;hall be &s;illy: I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the compliment had not been made, replied my aunt. But, my dear, come along with me.</P>
<P>She went out. I followed her; a little reluctantly, however; and Lucy tells me, that I looked &s;o &s;illy, as was enough, of it&s;elf to inform every-body of the in|tent of my withdrawing, and that I expected Sir Charles would follow me.</P>
<P>She was very cruel, I told her; and in my ca&s;e would have looked as &s;illy as I; while <HI>I</HI> &s;hould have pitied <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111">
I led to my clo&s;et. My aunt &s;eating me there, was going from me. Well. madam, and &s;o I am to &s;tay here quietly, I &s;uppo&s;e, till Sir Charles vouch&s;afes to come? Would Clementina have done &s;o?</P>
<P>No hint to him of Clementina in this way, I charge you: It would look ungrateful, and girli&s;h. I will introduce him to you&mdash;</P>
<P>And &s;tay with me, I hope, madam, when he is in|troduced. I tell you, Lady G. all my foibles. Away went my aunt; but &s;oon returned, and with her the man of men.</P>
<P>She but turned her&s;elf round, and &s;aw him take my hand, which he did with a compliment that would have made me proud at another time, and left us to|gether.</P>
<P>I was re&s;olved then to a&s;&s;ume all my courage, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to be pre&s;ent to my&s;elf. He <HI>was</HI> to him|&s;elf; yet had a mode&s;ty and politene&s;s in his manner, which &s;oftened the dignity of his addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Some men, I fancy, would have begun with ad|miring, or pretending to admire, the pieces of my own workman&s;hip, which you have &s;een hang here: But not he. After another compliment made (as I pre|&s;ume, to re-a&s;&s;ure me) on my re&s;tored complexion (I did indeed feel my face glow); he &s;poke directly to his &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I need not, I am &s;ure, &s;aid he, repeat to my dear Mi&s;s Byron what I &s;aid ye&s;terday, as to the delicacy of my &s;ituation, with regard to what &s;ome would deem a divided or double Love. I need not repeat to you the very great regard I have, and ever &s;hall have, for the Lady abroad. Her merit, and your greatne&s;s of mind, render any apology for &s;o ju&s;t a regard needle&s;s. But it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, what I can with truth &s;ay, that I love not my own Soul better than I love Mi&s;s Byron. You &s;ee, madam, I am wholly free, with regard to that Lady&mdash;free by her own choice, by her own will.&mdash;You &s;ee, that the whole family build
<PB N="111" REF="112">
a part of their happine&s;s on the &s;ucce&s;s of my addre&s;s to a Lady of my own country. Clementina's wi&s;h always was, that I would marry; and only be careful, that my choice &s;hould not di&s;grace the regard &s;he vouch&s;afed to own for me. Clementina, when &s;he has the plea&s;ure of knowing the dear Lady before me, if that <HI>may</HI> be, by the name of Grandi&s;on, will con|fe&s;s, that my choice has done the highe&s;t credit to the favour &s;he honoured me with.</P>
<P>And will you not, my dear Lady G. be ready to a&s;k, Could Sir Charles Grandi&s;on be really in earne&s;t in this humble court (as if he doubted her favour) to a creature, every wi&s;h of who&s;e heart was devoted to him? Did he not rather for his own &s;ake, in order to give her the con&s;equence which a wife of his ought to have, re&s;olve to dignify the poor girl, who had &s;o long been mortified by cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and who had &s;o often de&s;paired of ever being happy with the Lord of her heart? O no, my dear, your brother <HI>looked</HI> the humble, the mode&s;t Lover; yet the man of &s;en&s;e, of dignity, in Love. I could not but be a&s;&s;ured of his affection, notwith&s;tanding all that had pa&s;&s;ed. And what <HI>had</HI> pa&s;&s;ed, that he could po&s;&s;ibly have helped?&mdash;His pleas of the day before, the contents of Signor Jeronymo's Letter, were all in my mind.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed to expect my an&s;wer. He only, who&s;e generou&s;ly-<HI>doubting</HI> eye kept down mine, can tell how I looked, how I behaved&mdash;But he&s;itatingly, trem|blingly, both voice, and knees, as I &s;at; thus broken|ly, as near as I remember, I an&s;wered, not withdraw|ing my hand, tho', as I &s;poke, he more than once pre&s;&s;ed it with his lips:&mdash;The honour of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on&mdash;Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's honour&mdash;no one ever did, or ever can, doubt.&mdash;I mu&s;t own&mdash;I mu&s;t confe&s;s&mdash;There I pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>What does my dear Mi&s;s Byron own?&mdash;What con|fe&s;s?&mdash;A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, madam, of my honour, of my gratitude.&mdash;Should you have <HI>doubts,</HI> &s;peak them. I
<PB N="112" REF="113">
de&s;ire your favour but as I clear up your doubts. I <HI>would</HI> &s;peak them for you&mdash;I <HI>have</HI> &s;poken them for you. I own to you, madam, that there may be force in your doubts, which nothing but your genero&s;ity, and affiance in the honour of the man before you, can induce you to get over. And thus far I will own again&s;t my&s;elf, that were the Lady, in who&s;e heart I &s;hould hope an intere&s;t, to have been circum&s;tanced as I was, my own delicacy would have been hurt; owing, indeed, to the high notion I have of the true Female delicacy.&mdash;Now &s;ay, now <HI>own,</HI> now <HI>confe&s;s,</HI> my dear Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;what you were going to <HI>con|fe&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This, Sir, is my confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;and it is the confe&s;|&s;ion of a heart which I hope is as &s;incere as your own&mdash;That I am dazled, confounded, &s;hall I &s;ay? at the &s;uperior merits of the Lady you &s;o nobly, &s;o like your|&s;elf, glory &s;till in e&s;teeming as &s;he well de&s;erves to be e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>Joy &s;eemed to fla&s;h from his eyes&mdash;He bowed on my hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it with his lips; but was either &s;ilent by choice, or could not &s;peak.</P>
<P>I proceeded, tho' with a he&s;itating voice, a glowing cheek, and downca&s;t eyes&mdash;I fear not, Sir, any more than <HI>&s;he</HI> did, your honour, your Ju&s;tice, no nor your indulgent tenderne&s;s&mdash;<HI>Your</HI> character, <HI>your</HI> principles, Sir, are full &s;ecurity to the woman who &s;hall endea|vour to de&s;erve from you that indulgence&mdash;But &s;o ju&s;tly high do I think of Lady Clementina, and her conduct, that I fear&mdash;ah, Sir, I fear&mdash;that it is im|po&s;&s;ible&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;topt&mdash;I am &s;ure I was in earne&s;t, and mu&s;t <HI>look</HI> to be &s;o, or my countenance and my heart were not allied.</P>
<P>What <HI>impo&s;&s;ible!</HI>&mdash;What fears my dear Mi&s;s Byron is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible?</HI></P>
<P>Why (thus kindly urged, and by a man of unque&s;|tionable honour) &s;hall I not &s;peak all that is in my
<PB N="113" REF="114">
mind? The poor Harrier Byron fears, &s;he <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> fears, when &s;he contemplates the magnanimity of that ex|alted Lady, that with all her care, with all her en|deavours, &s;he never &s;hall be able to make the figure to HERSELF, which is nece&s;&s;ary for her own tranquil|lity (however <HI>you</HI> might generou&s;ly endeavour to <HI>a&s;|&s;ure</HI> her doubting mind). This, Sir, is my doubt&mdash;And&mdash;<HI>all</HI> my doubt.</P>
<P>Generous, kind, noble Mi&s;s Byron! in a rapturous accent&mdash;And is this <HI>all</HI> your doubt? Then mu&s;t yet the man before you be a happy man; for he que&s;tions not, if life be lent him, to make you one of the hap|pie&s;t of women. Clementina has acted gloriou&s;ly in preferring to all other con&s;iderations her Religion and her Country: I can allow this in her favour, again&s;t my&s;elf: And &s;hall I not be doubly bound in gratitude to her &s;i&s;ter-excellence, who, having not tho&s;e trials, yet the mo&s;t delicate of human minds, &s;hews in my favour a frankne&s;s of heart which &s;ets her above little forms and affectation, and at the &s;ame time a genero|&s;ity with regard to the merits of another Lady which has few examples?</P>
<P>He then on one knee, taking my pa&s;&s;ive hand be|tween both his, and ki&s;&s;ing it, once, twice, thrice&mdash;Repeat, dear, and ever-dear, Mi&s;s Byron, that this is <HI>all</HI> your doubt [I bowed a&s;&s;entingly: I could not &s;peak]&mdash;A happy, an ea&s;y ta&s;k, is mine! Be a&s;&s;ured, deare&s;t madam, that I will di&s;avow every action of my life, every thought of my heart, every word of my mouth, which tends not to di&s;&s;ipate that doubt.</P>
<P>I took out my handkerchief&mdash;</P>
<P>My dear Mi&s;s Byron, proceeded he, with an ardour that be&s;poke his heart, you are goodne&s;s it&s;elf. I ap|proached you with diffidence, with <HI>more</HI> than diffi|dence, with apprehen&s;ion, becau&s;e of your known de|licacy; which I was afraid, on this occa&s;ion, would <HI>de&s;cend</HI> into punctiliou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;My ble&s;&s;ings attend my future life, as my grateful heart &s;hall acknowlege this goodne&s;s!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115">
Again he ki&s;&s;ed my hand, ri&s;ing with dignity. I could have received his vows on my knees; but I was motionle&s;s, yet I had joy to be enabled to give him joy.&mdash;Joy to your brother! to Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on!</P>
<P>He &s;aw me greatly affected, and indeed my emotion increa&s;ed on reflection. He con&s;iderately &s;aid, I will leave you, my dear Mi&s;s Byron, to intitle my&s;elf to the congratulations of all our friends below. From this moment, after a thou&s;and &s;u&s;pences and &s;trange events, which, un&s;ought for, have chequered my pa&s;t life, I date my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>He mo&s;t re&s;pectfully left me.</P>
<P>I was glad he did: Yet my eyes followed him. His very &s;hadow was grateful to me, as he went down|&s;tairs. And there, it &s;eems, he congratulated him&s;elf, and called for the congratulations of every one pre&s;ent, in &s;o <HI>noble</HI> a manner, that every eye run over with joy.</P>
<P>Was I not right, &s;aid my grandmamma to my aunt (You half-blamed me, my dear) in leaving Sir Charles and my Harriet together? Harriet ever was above di&s;|gui&s;e Sir Charles might have <HI>gue&s;&s;ed</HI> at her heart; but he would not have <HI>known</HI> it from her own lips, had &s;he had you and me to refer to.</P>
<P>Whatever <HI>you</HI> do, madam, an&s;wered my aunt, mu&s;t be right.</P>
<P>My aunt came up to me. She found me in a very thoughtful mood. I had &s;ometimes been accu&s;ing my&s;elf of forwardne&s;s, and at others was acquitting my&s;elf or endeavouring to do &s;o&mdash;yet mingling, tho' thus early, a hundred delightful circum&s;tances with my accu&s;ations and acquittals, which were likely to ble&s;s my future lot. Such as, his relations and friends being mine, mine his; and I run them over all by name. But my Emily, my dear Emily! I con&s;idered as <HI>my</HI> ward, as well as his. In this way my aunt found me. She embraced me, applauded me, and
<PB N="115" REF="116">
cleared up all my &s;elf-doubtings, as to forwardne&s;s; and told me of their mutual congratulations below, and how happy I had made them all. What &s;elf|confidence did her approbation give me!&mdash;And as &s;he a&s;&s;ured me that my uncle would not railly, but extol me, I went down, with &s;pirits much higher than I went up with.</P>
<P>Sir Charles and my grandmamma were talking to|gether, &s;itting &s;ide by &s;ide, when I entered the room. All the company &s;tood up at my entrance.&mdash;O my dear! what a Prince&s;s in every one's eye will the de|clared Love of &s;uch a man make me! How will all the con&s;equence I had before, among my partial friends and favourers, be augmented!</P>
<P>My uncle &s;aid, <HI>&s;ideling</HI> by me (kindly intending not to da&s;h me) My &s;weet &s;parkler! [That was the name he u&s;ed to call me, before Sir Charles Grandi&s;on taught me a le&s;&s;on that made me thoughtful] You are now again my delight, and my joy. I thank you for not being&mdash;a fool&mdash;that's all. Egad, I was afraid of your <HI>Femality,</HI> when you came face to face.</P>
<P>Sir Charles came to me, and, with an air of the mo&s;t re&s;pectful love, taking my hand, led me to a &s;eat between him&s;elf and my grandmamma.</P>
<P>My ever-dear Harriet, &s;aid &s;he, and conde&s;cended to lift up my hand to her lips, I will not aba&s;h you; but mu&s;t ju&s;t &s;ay, that you have acquitted your&s;elf as I wi&s;hed you to do. I knew I could tru&s;t to a heart that ever was above affectation or di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, madam, &s;aid I, has the genero&s;ity to di&s;tingui&s;h and encourage a doubting mind.</P>
<P>Infinitely obliging Mi&s;s Byron, replied he, pre&s;&s;ing one hand between both his, as my grandmamma held the other, your conde&s;cen&s;ion attracts both my Love and Reverence. Permit me to &s;ay, That had not Heaven given a Mi&s;s Byron for the object of my hope, I had hardly, after what had befallen me <HI>abroad,</HI> ever looked forward to a wedded Love.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">
One favour I have to beg of you, Sir, re&s;umed my grandmamma: It is, that you will never u&s;e the word <HI>abroad</HI> or expre&s;s <HI>per&s;ons</HI> by their <HI>countries</HI>; in fine, that you will never &s;peak with re&s;erve, when the ad|mirable Clementina is in your thoughts. Mention her name with freedom, my dear Sir, to my child, to me, and to my daughter Selby&mdash;you may&mdash;We always loved and reverenced her: Still we do &s;o. She has given an example to all her Sex, of a pa&s;&s;ion properly &s;ubdued&mdash;Of temporal con&s;iderations yielding to eternal!</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, bowing as I &s;at, I join in this reque&s;t.</P>
<P>His eyes gli&s;tened with grateful joy. He bowed low to each, but &s;poke not.</P>
<P>My aunt came to us, and &s;at down by Sir Charles, refu&s;ing his &s;eat, becau&s;e it was next me. Let me, &s;aid &s;he, enjoy your conver&s;ation: I have heard part of your &s;ubject, and &s;ub&s;cribe to it, with all my heart. Lady G. can te&s;tify for us all three, that we cannot be &s;o mean, as to intend you a compliment, Sir, by what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>Nor can I, madam, as to imagine it. You exalt <HI>your&s;elves</HI> even more than you do Clementina. I will let my Jeronymo know &s;ome of the particulars which have given joy to <HI>my</HI> heart. They will make <HI>him</HI> happy; and the excellent Clementina (I will <HI>not</HI> for|bear her name) will rejoice in the happy pro&s;pects be|fore me. She wanted but to be a&s;&s;ured that the friend &s;he &s;o greatly honoured with her regard, was not likely (either in the qualities of the Lady's mind, or in her family-connections) to be a &s;ufferer by her declin|ing his addre&s;s.</P>
<P>May nothing now happen, my dear Lady G. to overcloud&mdash;But I will not be apprehen&s;ive. I will thankfully enjoy the pre&s;ent moment, and leave the future to the All-wi&s;e Dipo&s;er of events. If Sir Charles Grandi&s;on be mine, and reward by his kind|ne&s;s my Love, what can befal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> me, that I ought not to bear with re&s;ignation?</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">
But, my dear Ladies, let me here a&s;k you a que|&s;tion, or two.</P>
<P>Tell me, Did I ever, as you remember, &s;uffer by &s;u&s;pen&s;es, by <HI>any</HI> -thing?&mdash;Was there ever really &s;uch a man as Sir Hargrave Pollexfen?&mdash;Did I not tell you my <HI>dreams,</HI> when I told you of what I believed I had undergone from his per&s;ecuting in&s;ults? It is well, for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving to me the grace of humility, and for the &s;ake of warning (for all my days <HI>preceding</HI> that in&s;ult had been happy) that I wrote down <HI>at the time</HI> an account of tho&s;e &s;ufferings, tho&s;e &s;ufferings, or I &s;hould have been apt to forget now, that I ever was unhappy.</P>
<P>And, pray, let me a&s;k, Ladies, Can you gue&s;s what is become of my illne&s;s? I was very ill, you know, when you, Lady G. did us the honour of a vi&s;it; &s;o ill, that I could not hide it from you, and my other dear friends, as fain I would have done. I did not think it was an illne&s;s of &s;uch a nature, as that its cure depended on an ea&s;y heart. I wa &s;o much convinced of the merits of Lady Clementina, and that no other woman in the world ought to be Lady Grandi&s;on, that I thought I had pretty tolerably quieted my heart in that expectation. I hope I brag not too &s;oon. But, my dear, I now &s;ee! &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o light, &s;o happy&mdash;that I hardly know what's the matter with me&mdash;But I hope nobody will <HI>find</HI> the malady I have <HI>lo&s;t.</HI> May no di&s;appointed heart be invaded by it! Let it not tra|vel to Italy! The dear Lady there has &s;uffered enough from a wor&s;e malady! Nor, if it &s;tay in the i&s;land, let it come near the &s;ighing heart of my Emily! That dear girl &s;hall be happy, if it be in my power to make her &s;o. Pray, Ladies, tell her &s;he &s;hall.&mdash;No, but don't: I will tell her &s;o my&s;elf by the next po&s;t. Nor let it, I pray God, attack Lady Anne S. or any of the half-&s;core Ladies, of whom once I was &s;o unwil|ling to hear.</P>

Our di&s;cour&s;e at table was on various &s;ubjects. My cou&s;in James was again very inqui&s;itive after the principal courts, and places of note, in Italy.</P>
<P>What plea&s;ure do I hope one day to receive from the peru&s;al (if I &s;hall be favoured with it) of Sir Charles's LITERARY JOURNAL, mentioned to Dr. Bartlett, in &s;ome of his Letters from Italy: For it in|cludes, I pre&s;ume, a de&s;cription of palaces, cities, cabinets of the curious, diver&s;ions, amu&s;ements, cu|&s;toms, of different nations. How attentive were we all, to the an&s;wers he made to my cou&s;in James's que|&s;tions! My memory &s;erves but for a few generals; and tho&s;e I will not trouble you with. Sir Charles told my cou&s;in that if he were determined on an ex|cur&s;ion abroad, he would furni&s;h him with recom|mendatory Letters.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville and his in&s;ult were one of our &s;ubjects after dinner, when the &s;ervants were withdrawn. Lucy expre&s;&s;ed her wonder, that he was &s;o &s;oon re|conciled to Sir Charles, after the menaces he had for years pa&s;t thrown out again&s;t any man who &s;hould be likely to &s;ucceed with me.</P>
<P>My uncle ob&s;erved, that Mr. Greville had not for a long time had any hopes; that he always was appre|hen&s;ive, that if Sir Charles Grandi&s;on were to make his addre&s;&s;es, he would &s;ucceed: That it had been his and Fenwick's cu&s;tom, to endeavour to blu&s;ter away their competitors <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. 1. Letter ii. p. 5. 6.</NOTE>. He po&s;&s;ibly, my uncle added, might hope to intimidate Sir Charles; or at lea&s;t, knowing his principles, might &s;uppo&s;e he ran no ri&s;que in the attempt.</P>
<P>Mr. Deane &s;aid, Mr. Greville had told him, that the moment he knew Mi&s;s Byron had cho&s;en her man, he would give up his preten&s;ions; but that, as long as &s;he remained &s;ingle, he was determined to per&s;ecute her, as he him&s;elf called it. Per&s;everance he had
<PB N="119" REF="120">
known do every-thing, after an admired woman had run through her circle of humble &s;ervants, and per|haps found her&s;elf di&s;appointed in her own choice; and for his part, but with <HI>her,</HI> he had no fondne&s;s for the married life; he cared not who knew it.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;poke of Mr. Greville with candour. He thought him a man of rough manners, but not ill-natured. He affected to be a joker, and often there|fore might be taken for a wor&s;e man than he really was. He believed him to be carele&s;s of his reputation, and one who &s;eemed to think there were wit and bravery in advancing free and uncommon things; and gloried in bold &s;urprizes. For my part, continued he, I &s;hould hardly have con&s;ented to cultivate his ac|quaintance, much le&s;s to dine with him to-morrow, but as he in&s;i&s;ted upon it, as a token of my for giving in him a behaviour that wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> really what a gentleman &s;hould not have pardoned him&s;elf for. I con&s;idered him, proceed Sir Charles, as a neighbour to this family, with whom you had lived, and perhaps cho&s;e to live, upon good terms. Bad neighbours are nui|&s;ances, e&s;pecially if they are people of fortune: It is in the power of &s;uch to be very trouble&s;ome in their own <HI>per&s;ons;</HI> and they will often let loo&s;e their <HI>&s;er|vants</HI> to defy, provoke, in&s;ult, and do mi&s;chief to tho&s;e they love not. Mr. Greville I thought, added he, de&s;erved to be the more indulged, for the &s;ake of his Love to Mi&s;s Byron. He is a proud man, and mu&s;t be mortified enough in having it generally known that &s;he had con&s;tantly rejected his &s;uit.</P>
<P>Why that's true, &s;aid my uncle. Sir Charles, you con&s;ider every-body. But I hope all's over between you.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but it is, Mr. Selby. Mr. Gre|ville's whole aim now, &s;eems to be, to come off with as little abatement of his pride, as po&s;&s;ible. He thinks, if he can pa&s;s to the world as one who having no hope him&s;elf, is de&s;irous to pronounce the cau&s;e of his friend,
<PB N="120" REF="121">
as he will acknowledge me to be, it will give him con&s;equence in the eye of the world, and be a gentle method of letting his pride down ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Very well, &s;aid my uncle; and a very good con|trivance for a proud man, I think.</P>
<P>It is an expedient of his friend Fenwick, replied Sir Charles; and Mr. Greville is not a little fond of it. And what, Ladies and Gentlemen, will you &s;ay, if you &s;hould &s;ee me come to church to-morrow with him, &s;it with him in the &s;ame pew, and go with him to dinner in his coach? It is his reque&s;t that I will. He thinks this will put an end to the whi&s;pers which have pa&s;&s;ed, in &s;pite of all his precaution, of a ren|counter between him and me: For he has given out, that he &s;trained his wri&s;t and arm by a fall from his hor&s;e. Tell me, dear Ladies, &s;hall I, or &s;hall I not, oblige him in this reque&s;t? He is to be with me to|night, for an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>My grandmamma &s;aid, that Mr. Greville was al|ways a very odd, a very particular man. She thought Sir Charles very kind to <HI>us</HI> in being &s;o willing to con|ciliate with him. My uncle declared, that he was very de&s;irous to live on good terms with all his neigh|bours, particularly with Mr. Greville, a part of who&s;e e&s;tate being intermixed with his, it might be in his power to be vexations, at lea&s;t to his tenants. Mr. Deane thought the compromi&s;e was a happy one; and he &s;uppo&s;ed entirely agreeable to Sir Charles's ge|nerous wi&s;hes to promote the good under&s;tanding of neighbours; and to the compa&s;&s;ion it was in his na|ture to &s;hew, to an un&s;ucce&s;sful rival.</P>
<P>Sir Charles then turning to Lucy; May I, Mi&s;s Selby, &s;aid he, do you think, without being too deep a <HI>de&s;igner,</HI> a&s;k leave of Mi&s;s Byron, on the pre&s;um|ption of her goodne&s;s to me, to bring Mr. Greville to drink tea with her to-morrow in the afternoon?</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Sir Charles, an&s;wered Lucy, &s;miling. But what &s;ay you, cou&s;in Byron, to this que&s;tion?</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122">
This hou&s;e is not mine, replied I; but I dare &s;ay. I may be allowed the liberty, in the names of my un|cle and aunt, to an&s;wer, that any per&s;on will be wel|come to Selby-hou&s;e, whom Sir Charles Grandi&s;on &s;hall think proper to bring with him.</P>
<P>Mr Greville, &s;aid Sir Charles, profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf unable to &s;ee any of you (Mi&s;s Byron, in particular) without an introductor. He makes a high compli|ment to me, when he &s;uppo&s;es me to be a proper one. If you give me leave, bowing to my uncle and aunt, I will an&s;wer him to his wi&s;hes; and hope, when he comes, every-thing will be pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ilence that happened between him and me.</P>
<P>Two or three lively things pa&s;&s;ed between Lucy and Sir Charles, on his repetition of her word <HI>de&s;igner.</HI> She began with advantage, but did not hold it; yet he gave her con&s;equence in the little debate, at his own expence.</P>
<P>My grandmamma will go to her own church; but will be here at dinner, and the re&s;t of the day. I have a thou&s;and things more to &s;ay, all agreeable; but it is now late, and a drow&s;y fit has come upon me. I will welcome it. Adieu, adieu, my dear Ladies! Felicitate, I am &s;ure you will,</P>

<P>WE were told, there would be a crouded church this morning, in expectation of &s;eeing the new humble &s;ervant of Mi&s;s Byron attending her thither: For it is every-where known, that Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on is come down to make his addre&s;&s;es to the young creature who is happy in every one's love and good

wi&s;hes, and all is now &s;aid to have been &s;ettled be|tween him and us, by his noble &s;i&s;ter, and Lord G. and Dr. Bartlett, when they were with us.&mdash;And we are to be married&mdash;O my dear Lady G! you cannot imagine how &s;oon. You &s;ee what credit you did us by your kind vi&s;it, my dear.</P>
<P>Many of the neighbourhood &s;eemed di&s;appointed, when they &s;aw me led in by my uncle, as Mr. Deane led my aunt, and Nancy and Lucy only attended by their brother. But it was not long before Mr. Gre|ville, Mr. Fenwick, and Sir Charles, entered and went into the pew of the former, which is over-a|gain&s;t ours. Mr. Greville and Mr. Fenwick bowed low to us, &s;everally, the moment they went into the pew, and to &s;everal others of the gentry.</P>
<P>Sir Charles had fir&s;t other devoirs to pay: To fal&s;e &s;hame, you have &s;aid, he was always &s;uperior. I was delighted to &s;ee the example he &s;et. He paid us his &s;econd compliments with a grace peculiar to him&s;elf. I felt my face glow, on the whi&s;pering that went round. I thought I read in every eye, admiration of him, even through the &s;ticks of &s;ome of the Ladies fans.</P>
<P>What a difference was there between the two men and him, in their behaviour, throughout both the &s;er|vice, and &s;ermon! Yet who ever beheld two of the three &s;o decent, &s;o atttentive, &s;o <HI>reverent,</HI> I may &s;ay, before? Were all who call them&s;elves gentlemen (thought I, more than once) like <HI>this,</HI> the world would yet be a good world.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville had his arm in a &s;ling. He &s;eemed highly delighted with his gue&s;t; &s;o did Mr. Fenwick. When the &s;ermon was ended, Mr. Greville held the pew-door ready opened, to attend our movements; and when we were in motion to go, he, taking offi|ciou&s;ly Sir Charles's hand, bent towards us Sir Charles met us at our pew-door: He approached us with that ea&s;y grace peculiar to him&s;elf, and offered, with a profound re&s;pect his hand to me.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">
This was equal to a public declaration. It took every-body's attention. He is not a&s;hamed to avow in public, what he thinks fit to own in private.</P>
<P>I was humbled more than exalted by the general notice. Mr. Greville (bold, yet low man! made a motion, as if he gave the hand that Sir Charles took. Mr. Fenwick offered his hand to Lucy. Mr. Greville led my aunt; and not &s;peaking low (&s;ubtle as a &s;er|pent!) My plaguy hor&s;e, &s;aid he, looking at his &s;ling, knew not his ma&s;ter. I invite my&s;elf to tea with you, madam, in the afternoon. You will &s;upply my lame arm, I hope, your&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is no &s;uch thing as keeping private one's movements in a country-town, if one would. One of our &s;ervants reported the general approbation. It is a plea&s;ure, &s;urely, my dear Ladies, to be addre&s;&s;ed to by a man of whom every one approves. What a poor figure mu&s;t &s;he make, who gives way to a court|&s;hip from a man whom every-body blames her for encouraging! Such women indeed generally confe&s;s indirectly the &s;olly, by carrying on the affair clan|de&s;tinely.</P>

<P>O MY dear! I have been &s;trangely di&s;concerted by means of Mr. Greville. He is a &s;trange man. But I will lead to it in cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We all went to church again in the afternoon. Every-body who knew Mr. Greville, took it for a high pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e of politene&s;s in him to his gue&s;t, that he came twice the &s;ame day to church. Sir Charles edified every-body by his chearful piety. Are you not of opi|nion, my dear Lady G. that wickedne&s;s may be al|ways put out of countenance by a per&s;on who has an e&s;tabli&s;hed character for goodne&s;s, and who is not a&s;hamed of doing his duty in the public eye? Me|thinks I could wi&s;h that all the pro&s;ligates in the pari&s;h had their &s;eats around that of a man who has fortitude enough to dare to be good. The text was a happy

<P>Sir Charles conducted my aunt to her coach, as Mr. Greville officiou&s;ly, but properly for hi views, did me. We found Mr. Fenwick at Selby-hou&s;e talking to my grandmamma on the new &s;ubject. She dined with us; but, not being very well, cho&s;e to retire to her devotions in my clo&s;et, while we went to church, &s;he having been at her own in the morning.</P>
<P>We all received Mr. Greville with civility. He affects to be thought a wit, you know, and a great joker. Some men cannot appear to advantage with|out making their friend a butt to &s;hoot at. Fenwick and he tried to play upon each other, as u&s;ual. Sir Charles lent each his &s;mile; and, whatever he thought of them, &s;hewed not a contempt of their great-boy &s;nip-&s;nap. But, at la&s;t, my grandmamma and aunt engaged Sir Charles in a conver&s;ation, which made the gentlemen &s;o &s;ilent, and &s;o attentive, that had they not fla&s;hed a good deal at each other before, one might have thought them a little di&s;creet.</P>
<P>Nobody took the lea&s;t notice of what had pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Greville and Sir Charles, till Mr. Gre|ville touched upon the &s;ubject to me. He de&s;ired an audience of ten minutes, as he &s;aid; and, upon his declaration, that it was the la&s;t he would ever ask of me on the &s;ubject; and, upon my grandmamma's &s;ay|ing, Oblige Mr. Greville, my dear; I permitted him to draw me to the window.</P>
<P>His addre&s;s was nearly in the following words; not &s;peaking &s;o low, but every one might hear him, tho' he &s;aid aloud, Nobody mu&s;t but me:</P>

favour. You may think me vain: I believe I am &s;o: But I may take to my&s;elf the advantages and qualities which every-body allows me. I have an e&s;tate that will warrant my addre&s;&s;es to a woman of the fir&s;t rank; and it it is free, and unincumbered. I am not an ill-natured man. I love my je&s;t, 'tis true; but I love my friend. You good women generally do not like a man the le&s;s for having &s;omething to mend in him. I could &s;ay a great deal more in my own behalf, but that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on (looking at him) quite eclip&s;es me. Devil fetch me, if I can tell how to think my&s;elf <HI>any</HI> -thing before him. I was always a|fraid of him. But when I heard he was gone abroad, in pur&s;uit of a former Love, I thought I had another chance for it.</P>
<P>Yet I was half-afraid of Lord D. His mother would manage a Machiavel. He has a great e&s;tate; a title; he has good qualities for a nobleman. But when I found that you could &s;o &s;teadily refu&s;e him, as well as me; There mu&s;t be &s;ome man, thought I, who is lord of her heart. <HI>Fenwick</HI> is as &s;ad a dog as I; it cannot be he. <HI>Orme,</HI> poor &s;oul! &s;he will not have &s;uch a milk-&s;op as that, neither&mdash;</P>

<P>Well then, Sir, &s;miling, come to your la&s;t words, as &s;oon as you can.</P>
<P>I have told you, before now, Mi&s;s Byron, that I will not bear your &s;miles. But now &s;miles or frowns, I care not. I have no hopes left; and I am re&s;olved to abu&s;e you before I have done.</P>
<P>Abu&s;e me! I hope not, Sir.</P>
<P>'Hope not!' What &s;ignify <HI>your</HI> hopes, who ne|ver gave me any? But hear me out. I &s;hall &s;ay &s;ome thing that will di&s;plea&s;e you; but more of another nature. I went on gue&s;&s;ing who could be the happy man. That <HI>&s;econd</HI> Orme, Fowler, cannot be he,

He is a pretty fellow enough [I had all your foot&s;teps watched, as I told you I would.] No, an&s;wered I my|&s;elf, &s;he refu&s;ed Lord D. and a whole tribe of us, be|fore Beauchamp came to England&mdash;Who the devil can he be?&mdash;But when I heard that the dangerous man, whom I hadt hought gone abroad to his matri|monial de&s;tiny, was returned, unmarried; when I heard that he was actually coming northward; I be|gan to be again afraid of him.</P>
<P>La&s;t Thur&s;day night I had intelligence, that he was &s;een at Dun&s;table in the morning, in his way towards us. Then did my heart fail me. I had my &s;pies a|bout Selby-hou&s;e: I own it. What will not Love and Jealou&s;y make a man do? I under&s;tood, that your uncle and Mr. Deane, and a tribe of &s;ervants for train-&s;ake, were &s;et out to meet him. How I raved! How I cur&s;ed! How I &s;wore!&mdash;They will not &s;ure|ly, thought I, allow my rival, at his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> vi&s;it, to take up his re&s;idence under the &s;ame roof with this charm|ing Witch!</P>
<P>Witch! Mr. Greville&mdash;</P>

<P>To what purpo&s;e?&mdash;I can have no hope. What is to be expected <HI>for</HI> or <HI>from</HI> a de&s;pairing man?&mdash;But then I had intelligence brought me, that my rival was not admitted to take up his abode with you. This

&s;aved Selby-hou&s;e. All my malice then was again&s;t the George at Northampton. The keeper of it owes, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, a hundred thou&s;and obligations to me; yet to afford a retirement to my deadlie&s;t foe!&mdash;But 'tis more manly, thought I, m per&s;on, to call this invader to account&punc; if he pretends an intere&s;t at Selby-hou&s;e; and to force him to relinqui&s;h his preten&s;ions to the Queen of it; as I had made more than one gallant fellow do before, by dint of blu&s;ter.</P>
<P>I &s;lept not all that night. In the morning I made my vi&s;it at the inn. I pretend to know, as well as any man, what belongs to civility and good manners: but I knew the character of the man I had to deal with: I knew he was cool, yet re&s;olute. My rage would not let me be civil; and if it would, I knew I mu&s;t be rude to provoke him. I <HI>was</HI> rude. I was perem|ptory.</P>
<P>Never was there &s;uch cold, &s;uch phlegmatlc con|tempts pa&s;&s;ed upon man, as he pa&s;&s;ed upon me. I came to a point with him. I heard he would not fight: I was re&s;olved he &s;hould. I followed him to his chariot. I got him to a private place; but I had the devil, and no man, to deal with. He cautioned me, by way of in&s;ult, as I took it, to keep a guard. I took his hint. I had better not; for he knew all the tricks of the weapon. He was in with me in a mo|ment, I had no &s;word left me, and my life was at the mercy of his. He gave me up my own &s;word&mdash;Cautioned me to regard my &s;afety&mdash;Put up his; with|drew.&mdash;I found my&s;elf &s;en&s;ible of a damnable &s;train. I had no right-arm. I &s;lunk away like a thief. He mounted his triumphal car; and pur&s;ued his cour&s;e to to the Lady of Selby-hou&s;e. I went home, cur&s;ed, &s;wore, fell down, and bit the earth.</P>
<P>My uncle looked impatient: Sir Charles &s;eemed in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, but attentive. Mr. Greville proceeded:</P>
<P>I got Fenwick to go with me, to attend him at night, by appointment. Cripple as I was, I would
<PB N="128" REF="129">
have provoked him: He would not be provoked: And when I found that he had not expo&s;ed me at Selby-hou&s;e; when I remembered that I owed my &s;word and my life to his moderation; when I recollected his cha|racter; what he had done by Sir Hargrave Pollexfen; what Bagenhall had told me of him: Why the plague, thought I, &s;hould I (hopele&s;s as I am of &s;ucceeding with my charming Byron, whether <HI>he</HI> lives or dies) &s;et my face again&s;t &s;uch a man? He is incapable ei|ther of in&s;ult or arrogance: Let me (Fenwick advi&s;ed a &s;cheme) let me make him my friend to &s;ave my pride, and the devil take the re&s;t, Harriet Byron, and all&mdash;</P>
<P>Wicked man!&mdash;You was dying a thou&s;and words ago&mdash;I am &s;ick of you!&mdash;</P>
<P>You have not, madam, heard half my dying words yet&mdash;But I would not terrify you&mdash;Are you terri|fied?&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed I am.</P>
<P>Sir Charles motioned as if he would approach us; but kept his place, on my grandmamma's &s;aying, Let us hear his humour out: Mr. Greville was always particular.</P>
<P>Terrified, madam! What is <HI>your</HI> being terrified to the &s;leeple&s;s nights, to the tormenting days, you have given me? Cur&s;ing darkne&s;s, cur&s;ing light, and mo&s;t my&s;elf!&mdash;O madam! with &s;hut teeth, What a tor|ment of torments have you been to me!&mdash;Well, but now I will ha&s;ten to a conclu&s;ion, in mercy to you, who, however, never &s;hewed me any&mdash;</P>
<P>I never was cruel, Mr. Greville&mdash;</P>
<P>But you was; and mo&s;t cruel, when mo&s;t &s;weet|tempered. It was to that &s;miling obligingne&s;s that I owed my ruin! That gave me hope: that radiance of countenance; and that frozen heart!&mdash;O you are a dear deceiver!&mdash;But I ha&s;ten to conclude my dying &s;peech&mdash;Give me your hand!&mdash;I will have it&mdash;<HI>I will not eat it,</HI> as once I had like to have done.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'And now madam, hear my parting words&mdash;You will

have the glory of giving to the be&s;t of men, the be&s;t of wives. Let it not be long before you do; for the &s;ake of many, who will hope on till then. As your <HI>Lover,</HI> I mu&s;t hate him: As your <HI>Hu&s;band,</HI> I will love him. He will, he mu&s;t, be kind, affection|ate, grateful, to you; and you will de&s;erve all his tenderne&s;s. May you live (the ornaments of human nature as you are) to &s;ee your children's children; all promi&s;ing to be as good, as worthy, as happy, as your&s;elves! And, full of years, full of honour, in one hour may you be tran&s;lated to that Heaven where only you can be more happy, than you will be, if you are both as happy as I wi&s;h and expect you to be!'</Q></P>
<P>Tears dropt on my cheek, at this unexpected ble&s;&s;|ing; &s;o like that of the wicked prophet of old, ble&s;&s;|ing where he was expected to cur&s;e <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Balaam, Numb. xxii. &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He &s;till held my hand&mdash;I will not, without your leave, madam&mdash;May I, before I part with it?&mdash;He looked at me as if for leave to ki&s;s my hand, bowing his head upon it.</P>
<P>My heart was opened. God ble&s;s you, Mr. Gre|ville! as you have ble&s;&s;ed me&mdash;Be a good man, and he will.&mdash;I withdrew not my hand.</P>
<P>He kneeled on one knee; eagerly ki&s;&s;ed my hand, more than once. Tears were in his own eyes. He aro&s;e, hurried me to Sir Charles, and holding to him my then, through &s;urpri&s;e, half-withdrawn hand&mdash;Let me have the pride, the glory, Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on, to quit this dear hand to yours. It is only to yours that I would quit it&mdash;<HI>Happy, happy, happy, pair!&mdash;None but the brave de&s;erves the fair.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir Charles took my hand&mdash;Let this precious pre|&s;ent be mine, &s;aid he (ki&s;&s;ing it), mine, with the de|clared a&s;&s;ent of every one here; and pre&s;ented me to my grandmamma and aunt. I was frighted by the hurry the &s;trange man had put me into&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">
May I <HI>but</HI> live to &s;ee her yours, Sir! &s;aid my grand|mamma, in a kind of rapture!</P>
<P>The moment he had put my hand into Sir Charles's, he ran out of the room, with the utmo&s;t precipitation. He was gone, quite gone, when he came to be en|quired after; and every-body was unea&s;y for him, till we were told, by one of the &s;ervants, that he took from the window of the outward parlour his hat and &s;word; and by anotehr, that he met him, his &s;ervant after him, hurrying away, and even &s;obbing as he flew.&mdash;Was there ever &s;o &s;trange a man?</P>
<P>Don't you pity Mr. Greville, my dear?</P>
<P>Sir Charles was generou&s;ly unea&s;y for him.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, &s;aid Lucy (who had always charity for him) has frequently &s;urpri&s;ed us with his particu|larities; but I hope, from the la&s;t part of his beha|viour, that he is not the free-thinking man he &s;ome|times affects to be thought. I flatter my&s;elf, that Sir Charles had a righter notion of him than we, in what he &s;aid of him ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Sir Charles waited on my grandmamma home; &s;o we had him not to &s;upper. We are all to dine with her to-morrow. Your brother, you may &s;uppo&s;e, will be a principal gue&s;t.</P>

<P>I HAVE a Letter from my Emily; by which I find, &s;he is with you; tho' &s;he has not dated it. You was very kind in &s;hewing the dear girl the overflowings of my heart in her favour. She is all grateful love, and goodne&s;s. I will &s;oon write to her, to repeat my a&s;|&s;urances, that my whole power &s;hall always be exerted to do her plea&s;ure. But you mu&s;t tell her, as from your&s;elf, that &s;he mu&s;t have patience.

by &s;everal &s;tages. And yet, from what he intimated la&s;t night, as he waited on my grandmamma to Shir|ley-manor, I find, that his expectations are forwarder than it will be po&s;&s;ible for me to an&s;wer: And I mu&s;t, without intending the lea&s;t affectation, for common decorum-&s;ake, take the management of this point up|on my&s;elf. For, my dear, we are every one of us here &s;o much in Love with him, that the moment he &s;hould declare his wi&s;hes, they would be as ready to urge me t oblige him, were he even to limit me but to two or three days; as if they were afraid he would not repeat his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I have a Letter from Mr. Beauchamp. He writes, that there are no hopes of Sir Harry's recovery. I am very &s;orry for it. He does me great honour to write to me to give him con&s;olation. His is a charming Letter&mdash;So full of &s;ilial piety!&mdash;Excellent young man! He breathes in it the true &s;pirit of his <HI>friend.</HI></P>

<P>Mr. Fenwick ju&s;t now tells us, that Mr. Greville is not well, and keeps his chamber. He has my cor|dial wi&s;hes for his health. His la&s;t behaviour to me appears, the more I think of it, more &s;trange, from &s;uch a man. I expected not that he would conclude with &s;uch generous wi&s;hes. Nancy, who does not love him, &s;ays, that it was &s;uch an over&s;train of ge|nero&s;ity from him, that it might well over-&s;et him.

<P>WE have been very happy this day at my grand|mamma's. Your brother makes him&s;elf more and more beloved by all my friends; who yet declare, that they thought they could not have loved him bet|ter than they did before. My cou&s;in Holles's &s;ay, they could &s;ooner lay open their hearts to him, than to any man they ever &s;aw; yet their freedom would never make them lo&s;e &s;ight of their re&s;pect.</P>
<P>He told me, that he had breakfa&s;ted with Mr. Gre|ville. How does he conciliate the mind of every one to him! He &s;aid kind and compa&s;&s;ionate things of Mr. Greville; and <HI>&s;o</HI> unaffectedly!&mdash;I was delighted with him. For, regardful as he would be, and is, of his own honour; no low, narrow jealou&s;y, I dare &s;ay, will ever have entrance into his heart. <HI>Charity think|eth no evil!</HI> Of what a charming text is that a part <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 5.</NOTE>!&mdash;What is there equal to it, in any of the writings of the philo&s;ophers?</P>
<P>My dear Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he to me, Mr. Greville loves you more than you can po&s;&s;ibly imagine. De|&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s with you, he has a&s;&s;umed airs of bravery; but your name is written in large letters in his heart. He gave me continued he, the import|ance of a&s;king my <HI>leave</HI> to love you &s;till.&mdash;What <HI>ought</HI> I to have an&s;wered?&mdash;</P>
<P>What <HI>did</HI> you an&s;wer, Sir?</P>
<P>That &s;o far as I might pre&s;ume to give it, I gave it.
<PB N="133" REF="134">
Had I the honour, added I, of calling Mi&s;s Byron mine, I would not barely <HI>allow</HI> your love of her; I would <HI>demand</HI> it.&mdash;Have I not a&s;&s;ured you, Mr. Gre|ville, that I look upon you as my <HI>friend?</HI></P>
<P>You will quite &s;ubdue Mr. Greville, Sir, &s;aid I. You will, by the genero&s;ity of your treatment of him, do more than any-body el&s;e ever could&mdash;You will make him a good man.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, madam, de&s;erves pity, on more ac|counts than one. A wife, &s;uch a one as his good An|gel led him to wi&s;h for, would have &s;ettled his prin|ciples. He wants &s;teadine&s;s: But he is not, I hope, a bad man. I was not concerned for his cavalier treat|ment of you ye&s;terday, but on your own account; le&s;t his roughne&s;s &s;hould give you pain. But his con|cluding wi&s;hes, and his preference of a rival to him|&s;elf, together with the manner of his departure, un|able as he was to with&s;tand his own emotions, and the effect it had upon his &s;pirits, &s;o as to confine him to his chamber, had &s;omething great in it&mdash;And I &s;hall value him for it, as long as he will permit me.</P>
<P>Sir Charles and my grandmamma had a good deal of talk together. Dearly does &s;he love to &s;ingle him out. What a pretty picture would they make, could they be both drawn &s;o as not to cau&s;e a <HI>profane</HI> je&s;ter to fall into mi&s;takes; as if it were an old Lady make|ing Love to a hand&s;ome young man.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ketch it out&mdash;See, then, the dear Lady, with a countenance full of benignity, years written by venerablene&s;s, rather than by wrinkles, in her face; dignity and familiarity in her manner; one hand on his, talking to him: His &s;ine countenance &s;hining with mode&s;ty and reverence, looking down, delighted, as admiring her wi&s;dom, and not a little regardful of her half-pointing finger (Let that be, for fear of mi&s;|takes) to a creature young enough to be her grand|daughter; who, to avoid &s;hewing too much &s;en&s;ibi|lity, &s;hall &s;eem to be talking to two other young La|dies
<PB N="134" REF="135">
(Nancy and Lucy, &s;uppo&s;e); but, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h the young creature, let her, with a blu&s;h|ing cheek, ca&s;t a fly eye on the grandmamma and young gentleman, while the other two &s;hall not be a|fraid to look more free and unconcerned.</P>
<P>See, my dear, how fanciful I am: But I had a mind to tell you, in a new manner, how my grand|mamma and Sir Charles &s;eem to admire each other.</P>
<P>Mr. Deane and he had al&s;o &s;ome talk together; my uncle joined them: And I blu&s;hed in <HI>earne&s;t</HI> at the &s;ubject I only <HI>gue&s;&s;ed</HI> at from the following words of Mr. Deane, at Sir Charles's ri&s;ing to come from them to my aunt and me, who both of us &s;at in the bow-window. My dear Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, &s;aid Mr. Deane, you love to give plea&s;ure: I never was &s;o happy in my life, as I am in view of this long|wi&s;hed-for event. You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> oblige me: I in&s;i&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>My aunt took it, as I did.&mdash;A generous contention&punc; &s;aid &s;he. O my dear! we &s;hall all be too happy. God grant that nothing may fall out to di&s;concert us! If there <HI>&s;hould,</HI> how many broken hearts&mdash;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t broken one, madam, interrupted I, would be the happie&s;t: I, in that ca&s;e, &s;hould have the ad|vantage of every-body.</P>
<P>Dear love! you are too &s;erious (Tears were in my eyes): Sir Charles's unque&s;tionable honour is our &s;e|curity!&mdash;If Clementina be &s;tedfa&s;t; if life and health be &s;pared you and him&mdash;If&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear, dear madam, no more <HI>Ifs!</HI> Let there be but one <HI>If,</HI> and that on Lady Clementina's re&s;ump|tion. In that ca&s;e, I will &s;ubmit; and God only [as indeed He always ought] &s;hall be my reliance for the re&s;t of my life.</P>
<P>Lucy, Nancy, and my two cou&s;in Holles's came and &s;pread, two and two, the other &s;eats of the bow|window [there are but three] with their va&s;t hoops: undoubtedly, becau&s;e they &s;aw Sir Charles coming to
<PB N="135" REF="136">
us. It is difficult, whi&s;pered I to my aunt [petulantly enough], to get him one moment to one's &s;elf. My cou&s;in James (Silly youth! thought I) <HI>&s;topt</HI> him in his way to me: but Sir Charles would not long be &s;topt: He led the interrupter towards us; and a &s;eat not be|ing at hand, while the young Ladies were making a bu&s;tle to give him a place between them [to&s;&s;ing their hoops above their &s;houlders on one &s;ide] and my cou|&s;in James was ha&s;tening to bring him a chair; he threw him&s;elf at the &s;eet of my aunt and me, making the floor his feat.</P>
<P>I don't know how it was; but I thought I never &s;aw him look to more advantage. His attitude and behaviour had &s;uch a Lover-like appearance&mdash;Don't you &s;ee him, my dear?&mdash;His amiable countenance, <HI>&s;o</HI> artle&s;s, yet <HI>&s;o</HI> obliging, ca&s;t up to my aunt and me: His fine eyes meeting ours; mine, particularly, in their <HI>own</HI> way; for I could not help looking down, with a kind of proud ba&s;hfulne&s;s, as Lucy told me afterwards. How affected mu&s;t I have appeared, had I either turned my head a&s;ide, or looked &s;tiffly up, to avoid his!</P>
<P>I believe, my dear, we women in court&s;hp don't love, that men, if ever &s;o wi&s;e, &s;hould keep up to <HI>us</HI> the dignity of wi&s;dom; much le&s;s that they &s;hould be &s;olemn, formal, grave&mdash;Yet are we fond of re&s;pect and ob&s;ervance too.&mdash;How is it?&mdash;Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on can tell.&mdash;Did you think of your brother, Lady G. when you once &s;aid, that the man who would commend him&s;elf to the general favour of us young women, &s;hould be a Rake in his addre&s;s, and a Saint in his heart? Yet might you not have cho&s;en a better word than <HI>Rake?</HI> Are there not more clum&s;y and fooli&s;h Rakes, than polite ones; except we can be &s;o mi&s;taken, as to give to impudence the name of agree|able freedom?</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;ell immediately into the ea&s;ie&s;t (&s;hall I &s;ay the gallante&s;t?) the mo&s;t agreeable conver&s;ation, as
<PB N="136" REF="137">
if he mu&s;t be all of a piece with the freedom of his attitude; and mingled in his talk, two or three very pretty humourous &s;tories; &s;o that nobody thought of helping him again to a chair, or wi&s;hing him in one.</P>
<P>How did this little incident familiarize the amiable man, as a &s;till <HI>more</HI> amiable man than before, to my heart! In one of the little tales, which was of a gen|tleman in Spain &s;erenading his mi&s;tre&s;s; we a&s;ked him, if he could not remember a &s;onnet he &s;poke of, as a pretty one? He, without an&s;wering, &s;ung it in a mo&s;t agreeable manner; and, at Lucy's reque&s;t, gave us the Engli&s;h of it.</P>
<P>It is a very pretty &s;onnet, I will a&s;k him for a copy, and &s;end it to you, who under&s;tand the language.</P>
<P>My grandmamma, on Sir Charles's &s;inging, beck|oned to my cou&s;in James who going to her, &s;he whi&s;pered him. He &s;tept out, and pre&s;ently returned with a violin, and &s;truck up, as he entered, a minuet-tune Harriet, my love&punc; called out my grandmama. Without any other intimation, the mo&s;t agreeable of men, in an in&s;tant, was on his feet, reached his hat, and took me out.</P>
<P>How were we applauded! How was my grand|mamma delighted! The words charming couple, were whi&s;pered round, but loud enough to be heard. And when we had done, he led me to my &s;eat with an air that had all the real fine gentleman in it. But then he &s;at not down as before.&mdash;</P>
<P>I wonder if Lady Clementina ever danced with him.</P>
<P>My aunt, at Lucy's whi&s;pered reque&s;t, propo&s;ed a dance between Sir Charles and her. You, Lady G. ob&s;erved, more than once, that Lucy dances finely. In&s;ulter! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> her, when &s;he had done, you know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> me!&mdash;Harriet, replied &s;he, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">, when they &s;peak a|gain&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

<P><PB N="137" REF="138">
An admirable conver&s;ation followed at tea, in which my grandmother, aunt, my Lucy, and Sir Charles, bore the chief parts; every other per&s;on delighting to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Had we not, Lady G. a charming day?</P>
<P>In my next I &s;hall have an opportunity, perhaps, to tell you what kind of a travelling companion Sir Charles is. For, be plea&s;ed to know, that for &s;ome time pa&s;t a change of air, and a little excur&s;ion from place to place, have been pre&s;cribed for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of my health, by one of the hone&s;te&s;t phy&s;icians in England. The day before Sir Charles came into the&s;e parts, it was fixed, that to-morrow we &s;hould &s;et out upon this tour. On his arrival, we had thoughts of po&s;tponing it; but, having under&s;tood our intention, he in&s;i&s;ted upon its being pro&s;ecuted; and, offering his company, there was no declining the favour, you know, <HI>early</HI> days as they, however, are: And altho' every body abroad talks of the occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it to us; he has been &s;o far from directing his &s;ervants to make a &s;ecret of it, that he has ordered his Saunders to an&s;wer to every curious que&s;tioner, that Sir Charles and I were of longer acquaintance than ye&s;terday. But, is not this, my dear, a cogent intimation that Sir Charles thinks &s;ome parade, &s;ome delay, nece&s;&s;ary? Yet don't <HI>he</HI> and <HI>we</HI> know how little a while ago it is, that he made his fir&s;t declara|tion? What, my dear (&s;hould he be &s;olicitous for an early day) is the inference? My uncle, too, &s;o for|ward, that I am afraid of him.</P>
<P>We are to &s;et out to-morrow morning. Peter|borough is to be our furthe&s;t &s;tage, one way. Mr. Deane in&s;i&s;ts, that we &s;hall pa&s;s two or three days with him. All of us, but my grandmamma, are to be of his party.</P>
<P>O MY dear Lady G. what a Letter is ju&s;t brought me, by the hand that carried up mine on Saturday!
<PB N="138" REF="139">
Ble&s;s me! what an an&s;wer!&mdash;This wicked wi&s;h!&mdash;But I have not time to enter into &s;o large a field. Let me only &s;ay, That for &s;ome parts I mo&s;t heartily thank you and dear Lady L.; for others, I do not; and imagine Lady L. would not have &s;ub&s;cribed her beloved name, had &s;he read the whole.

<P>WE pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal hours at Boughton <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The &s;eat of the late Duke of Montagu.</NOTE>, and ar|rived here in the afternoon. Mr. Deane had in&s;i&s;ted that we &s;hould put up at a nephew's of his, in the neighbourhood of this town. The young gentle|man met us at Oundle, and conducted us to the hou&s;e. I have got &s;uch a habit of &s;cribbling, that I cannot forbear applying to my pen at every opportunity. The le&s;s wonder, when I have your brother for my &s;ubject; and the two beloved &s;i&s;ters of that brother to write to.</P>
<P>It would be almo&s;t impertinent to prai&s;e a man for his hor&s;eman&s;hip, who in his early youth was &s;o noted for the performance of all his exerci&s;es, that his Fa|ther and General W. thought of the military life for him. Ea&s;e and unaffected dignity di&s;tingui&s;h him in all his accompli&s;hments. Ble&s;s me, madam! &s;aid Lucy to my aunt, on more occa&s;ions than one, this man is every-thing!</P>
<P>Shall I own, that I am retired to my pen, ju&s;t now, from a very bad motive? <HI>Anger.</HI> I am, in my heart, even peevi&s;h with <HI>all</HI> my friends, for clu&s;tering &s;o about Sir Charles, that he can hardly obtain a moment
<PB N="139" REF="140">
(which he &s;eems to &s;eek for too) to talk with me alone. My uncle [He <HI>does</HI> dote upon him] always incon&s;iderately &s;tands in his way; and can I &s;ay to a man &s;o <HI>very</HI> inclinable to raillery, that he &s;hould al|low <HI>me</HI> more, and <HI>him&s;elf</HI> le&s;s, of Sir Charles's con|ver&s;ation? I wonder my <HI>aunt</HI> does not give my uncle a hint. But &s;he loves Sir Charles's company as well as my uncle.</P>
<P>This, however, is nothing to the di&s;tre&s;s my uncle gave me at dinner this day. Sir Charles was ob&s;erv|ing, upon the di&s;po&s;ition of one part of the gardens at Boughton, That Art was to be but the handmaid of Nature&mdash;I have heard, Sir Charle, &s;aid my uncle, that you have made that a rule with you at Grandi&s;on|hall. With what plea&s;ure &s;hould I make a vi&s;it there to <HI>you and my niece</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;topt. He <HI>needed not:</HI> He might have &s;aid any|thing after this. Sir Charles looked as if concerned for <HI>me;</HI> yet &s;aid, that would be a joyful vi&s;it to him. My aunt was vexed for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake. Lucy gave my uncle <HI>&s;uch</HI> a look!&mdash;</P>
<P>My uncle afterwards indeed apologized to me&mdash;<HI>Ads-heart,</HI> I was a little blunt, I believe. But what <HI>a duce</HI> need there be the&s;e niceties ob&s;erved when you are <HI>&s;ure?</HI>&mdash;I am &s;orry, however&mdash;But it would out&mdash;Yet you, Harriet, made it wor&s;e by looking &s;o &s;illy.</P>
<P>WHAT, Lady G. can I do with this dear man? My uncle, I mean. He has been ju&s;t making a pro|po&s;al to me, as he calls it, and with &s;uch <HI>hone&s;t</HI> looks of foreca&s;t and wi&s;dom&mdash;Look-ye, Harriet&mdash;I &s;hall be always blundering about your <HI>&s;crupulo&s;ities.</HI> I am come to propo&s;e &s;omething to you that will put it out of my power to make mi&s;take&mdash;I beg of you and your aunt to allow me to enter with Sir Charles into a certain &s;ubject; and this not for your &s;ake&mdash;I know you won't allow of that&mdash;But for the <HI>ea&s;e of Sir Charles's own heart.</HI> Gratitude is <HI>my</HI> motive, and
<PB N="140" REF="141">
ought to be <HI>yours.</HI> I am &s;ure he loves the very ground you tread upon.</P>
<P>I be&s;ought him for <HI>every</HI> &s;ake dear to him&s;elf, not to interfere in the matter; but to leave the&s;e &s;ubjects to my aunt and me.&mdash;Con&s;ider, Sir, &s;aid I, <HI>con&s;ider,</HI> how very lately the fir&s;t per&s;onal declaration was made.</P>
<P>I do, I will con&s;ider every-thing&mdash;But there is dan|ger between the cup and the lip.</P>
<P>Dear Sir (my hands and eyes lifted up) was all the an&s;wer I could make. He went from me ha&s;tily, muttering good-naturedly again&s;t <HI>Femalities.</HI></P>

<P>MR. DEANE'S pretty box you have &s;een. Sir Charles is plea&s;ed with it. We looked in at Fother|ingay-ca&s;tle <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The pri&s;on of Mary Queen of Scots.</NOTE>, Milton <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The &s;eat of Earl Fitzwilliams.</NOTE>, &amp;c. Mr. Charles Deane, a very obliging and &s;en&s;ible young gentleman, attended his uncle all the way.</P>
<P>What charming de&s;criptions of fine hou&s;es and cu|rio&s;ities abroad did Sir Charles give us when we &s;topt to bait, or to view the pictures, furniture, gardens, of the hou&s;es we &s;aw!</P>
<P>In every place, on every occa&s;ion, on the road, or when we alighted, or put up, he &s;hewed him&s;elf &s;o con&s;iderate, &s;o gallant, &s;o courteous, to allow who ap|proached him, and <HI>&s;o</HI> charitable!&mdash;Yet not indi&s;cri|minately to every-body that a&s;ked him: But he was bountiful indeed, on repre&s;entation of the mi&s;ery of two hone&s;t families. Beggars born, or tho&s;e who make begging a trade, if in health, and not lame or blind, have &s;eldom, it &s;eems, any &s;hare in his muni|&s;icence: But per&s;ons fallen from competence, and &s;uch as &s;truggle with &s;ome in&s;tant di&s;tre&s;s, or have large families, which they have not ability to maintain; the&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, are the objects of his bounty. Richard Saunders, who is &s;ometimes his almoner,
<PB N="141" REF="142">
told my Sally, that he never goes out but &s;omebody is the better for him: and that his <HI>manner</HI> of be&s;towing his charity is <HI>&s;uch,</HI> as, together with the poor peoples ble&s;&s;ings and prayers for him, often draws tears from his eyes.</P>
<P>I HAVE over-heard a dialogue that has ju&s;t now pa&s;&s;ed between my uncle and aunt. There is but a thin partition between the room they were in, and mine; and he &s;poke loud; my aunt now low; yet earne&s;t only, not angry. He had been propo&s;ing to her, as he had done to me, to enter into a certain &s;ubject, in pity to Sir Charles: None had he for his poor niece. No doubt, but he thought he was ob|liging me; and that my objection was only owing to <HI>Femality,</HI> as he calls it; a word I don't like. I never heard it from Sir Charles.</P>
<P>My aunt was not at all plea&s;ed with his motion. She wi&s;hed, as <HI>I</HI> had done, that he would not inter|fere in the&s;e <HI>nice</HI> matters. He took offence at the ex|clu&s;ion becau&s;e of the word <HI>nice.</HI> She &s;aid, He was too precipitating, a great deal: She did not doubt but Sir Charles would be full early in letting me know his expectations.</P>
<P>She &s;poke more deci&s;ively than &s;he is u&s;ed to do. He cannot bear her chidings, tho' ever &s;o gentle. I need not tell you, that he both loves and reveres her; but, as one of the lords of the creation, is apt to be jealous of his prerogatives. You u&s;ed to be diverted with his hone&s;t particularities.</P>
<P>What an <HI>ignoramus</HI> you women and girls make of me, Dame Selby! &s;aid he. I know nothing of the world, nor of men and women, that's certain. I am always to be <HI>documented</HI> by you and your <HI>minxes!</HI> But the <HI>duce</HI> take your <HI>niceties:</HI> You don't, you can't, poor &s;ouls, as you are, di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>men.</HI> You mu&s;t all of you go on in one <HI>rig-my-roll</HI> way; in one beaten track. Who the <HI>duce</HI> would have thought it
<PB N="142" REF="143">
needful, when a girl, and we all were wi&s;hing till our very hearts were <HI>bur&s;ting,</HI> for this man, when he was not in his own power, would think you mu&s;t now come with your <HI>hums,</HI> and your <HI>haws,</HI> and the whole <HI>circum-roundabouts</HI> of female non&s;en&s;e, to <HI>&s;tave off</HI> the point your hearts and &s;ouls are &s;et upon? I re|member, Dame Selby, tho' &s;o long ago, how <HI>you</HI> treated your future Lord and Ma&s;ter when you <HI>prank'd</HI> it, as Lady and Mi&s;tre&s;s. You vexed my very Soul, I can tell you that! And often, and often, when I left you, I &s;wore bitterly, that I never would come again as a Lover&mdash;tho' I was a poor for&s;worn wretch&mdash;God forgive me!</P>
<P>My dear Mr. Selby, you &s;hould not remember pa&s;t things. You had very odd ways&mdash;I was afraid, for a good while, of venturing with you at all&mdash;</P>
<P>Now, Dame Selby, I have you at a <HI>why-not,</HI> or I never had; tho', by the way, your <HI>un</HI> -evenne&s;s in|crea&s;ed my oddne&s;s.&mdash;But what oddne&s;s is in Sir Charles Grandi&s;on? If he is not <HI>even,</HI> neither you nor I were ever <HI>odd.</HI> What rea&s;on is there for <HI>him</HI> to run the <HI>Female gauntlope?</HI> I pity the excellent man; remembering how I was formerly vexed my&s;elf&mdash;I hate this <HI>&s;hilly-&s;hally</HI> fooling; the <HI>know your-mind</HI> and <HI>not</HI> know-your-mind non&s;en&s;e. As I hope to <HI>live and breathe,</HI> I'll, I'll, I'll blow you all up, without <HI>gun|powder</HI> or <HI>oatmeal,</HI> if an hone&s;t gentleman is thus to be fooled with; and after &s;uch a Letter too from his friend Jeronymo, in the names of the whole family, Lady G. for my money! [Ah, thought I, Lady G. gives better advice than &s;he even <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> to know how to take&punc;] I like her notion of parallel lines!&mdash;Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is none of your <HI>gew-gaw-whip-jacks,</HI> that you know not where to have. But I tell you, Dame Selby, that neither you nor your niece know how, with your <HI>fine</HI> &s;ouls, and <HI>fine</HI> &s;en&s;e, to go out of the common <HI>&s;emality-path,</HI> when you get a man into your gin, however &s;uperior he is to common
<PB N="143" REF="144">
<HI>infanglements,</HI> and low chicanery, and <HI>dull</HI> and <HI>cold</HI> forms, as Sir Charles properly called them, in his ad|dre&s;s to the little <HI>pug's-face.</HI> [I <HI>do</HI> love her, with all her pretty ape's tricks: For what are you all, but, right or wrong, apes of one another?] And do you think, with <HI>all your wi&s;dom,</HI> he &s;ees not through you? He does; and, as a wi&s;e man, mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e you all, with your <HI>femalities</HI> and <HI>for&s;ooths</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>No femality, Mr. Selby, is de&s;igned&mdash;No&mdash;</P>
<P>I am impatient, Dame Selby, light of my eye, and dear to my heart and &s;oul, as you are; I will take my own way, in this. I have no mind that the two deare&s;t creatures in the world, to me, &s;hould render them&s;elves <HI>de&s;pi&s;able</HI> in the eyes of a man they want to think highly of them. And here if I put in, and &s;ay but a wry word, as you think it&mdash;I am to be called to account.&mdash;</P>
<P>My dear, did you not begin the &s;ubject? &s;aid my aunt.</P>
<P>I am to be clo&s;etted, and to be <HI>documentized,</HI> pro|ceeded he&mdash;Not another word of your <HI>documentations,</HI> Dame Selby! I am not in a humour to bear them: I will take my own way&mdash;And that's enough.</P>
<P>And then, I &s;uppo&s;e, he &s;tuck his hands in his &s;ides, as he does when he is good-humouredly angry; and my aunt, at &s;uch times, gives up, till a more convenient opportunity, and then &s;he always carries her point (And why? Becau&s;e &s;he is always rea&s;on|able); for which he calls her a <HI>Parthian</HI> woman.</P>
<P>I heard her &s;ay, as he &s;talked out royally, repeating, that he would take his own way; I &s;ay no more, Mr. Selby&mdash;Only con&s;ider&mdash;</P>
<P>Oy, and let Harriet con&s;ider, and do <HI>you</HI> con&s;ider, Dame Selby: Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is not a common man.</P>
<P>I did not let my aunt know that I heard this &s;peech of my uncle: She only &s;aid to me, when &s;he &s;aw me, I have had a little debate with your uncle: We mu&s;t
<PB N="144" REF="145">
do as well as we can with him, my dear. He means well.</P>

<P>AFTER breakfa&s;t, fir&s;t one, then another, dropt away, and left only Sir Charles and me together. Lucy was the la&s;t that went; and the moment &s;he was withdrawn, while I was thinking to retire to dre&s;s, he placed him&s;elf by me: Think me not ab|rupt, my dear Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, that I take al|mo&s;t the only opportunity which has offered of enter|ing upon a &s;ubject that is next my heart.</P>
<P>I found my face glow. I was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>You have given me hope, madam: All your friends encourage that hope. I love, I revere, your friends. What I have now to petition for, is, A confirmation of the hope I have pre&s;umed upon. CAN you, madam (the Female delicacy is more delicate than that of man <HI>can</HI> be) unequally as you may think your&s;elf circum|&s;tanced with a man who owns that once he could have devoted him&s;elf to another Lady; CAN you &s;ay, that the man before you is the man whom you CAN, whom you DO, prefer to any other?</P>
<P>He &s;topt; expecting my an&s;wer.</P>
<P>After &s;ome he&s;itations, I have been accu&s;tomed&punc; Sir, &s;aid I, by tho&s;e friends whom you &s;o <HI>de&s;ervedly</HI> value, to &s;peak nothing but the &s;imple&s;t truth. In an article of this moment, I &s;hould be inexcu&s;able, if&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;topt. His eyes were fixed upon my face. For my life I could not &s;peak; yet wi&s;hed to be able to &s;peak&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>If,</HI> If <HI>what,</HI> madam? and he &s;natched my hand, bowed his face upon it, held it there, not looking up to mine. I could then &s;peak&mdash;If thus urged, and by SIR CHARLES GRANDISON&mdash;I did not &s;peak my heart&mdash;I an&s;wer&mdash;Sir&mdash;I CAN&mdash;I DO. I wanted, I thought, ju&s;t then, to &s;hrink into my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He ki&s;&s;ed my hand with fervour; dropt down on
<PB N="145" REF="146">
one knee; again ki&s;&s;ed it&mdash;You have laid me, madam, under everla&s;ting obligation: And will you permit me, before I ri&s;e&mdash;lovelie&s;t of women, will you per|mit me, to beg an early day?&mdash;I have many affairs on my hands; many more in de&s;ign, now I am come, as I hope, to &s;ettle in my native country for the re&s;t of my life. My chief glory will be, to behave com|mendably in the <HI>private</HI> life. I wi&s;h not to be a <HI>public</HI> man; and it mu&s;t be a very particular call, for the Service of my King and Country united, that &s;hall draw me out into public notice. Make me, madam, &s;oon, the happy <HI>husband</HI> I hope to be. I pre&s;cribe not to you the time: But you are above empty forms. May I pre&s;ume to hope, it will be before the end of a month to come?</P>
<P>He had forgot him&s;elf. He &s;aid, he would not pre|&s;cribe to me.</P>
<P>After &s;ome involuntary he&s;itations&mdash;I am afraid of nothing &s;o much, ju&s;t now, Sir, &s;aid I, as appearing, to a man of your honour and penetration, affected. Ri&s;e, Sir, I be&s;eech you! I cannot bear&mdash;</P>
<P>I will, madam, and ri&s;e as well as kneel, to thank you, when you have an&s;wered a que&s;tion &s;o very im|portant to my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Before I could re&s;ume, Only believe me, madam, &s;aid he, that my urgency is not the in&s;olent urgency of one who imagines a Lady will receive as a <HI>compli|ment</HI> his impatience. And if you have no &s;cruple that you think of <HI>high</HI> importance, add, I be&s;eech you, to the obligation you have laid him under to your con|de&s;cending goodne&s;s (and add with that frankne&s;s of heart which has di&s;tingui&s;hed you in my eyes above all women) the very high one, of an early day.</P>
<P>I looked down&mdash;I could not look up&mdash;I was afraid of being thought affected&mdash;Yet how could I &s;o &s;oon think of obliging him?</P>
<P>He proceeded&mdash;You are &s;ilent, madam!&mdash;Propi|tious be your &s;ilence! Allow me to enquire of your
<PB N="146" REF="147">
<HI>aunt,</HI> for your kind, your conde&s;cending acquie&s;cence. I will not now urge you further: I will be all hope.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ay, Sir, that I mu&s;t not be precipitated. The&s;e are very early days.</P>
<P>Much more was in my mind to &s;ay; but I he&s;i|tated&mdash;I could not &s;peak. Surely, my dear Ladies, it was too-too eary an urgency. And can a woman be wholly unob&s;ervant of cu&s;tom, and the laws of her Sex?&mdash;Something is due to fa&s;hion in dre&s;s, however ab&s;urd that dre&s;s might have appeared in the la&s;t age (as theirs do to us) or may in the next: And &s;hall not tho&s;e cu&s;toms which have their foundation in mode&s;ty, and are characteri&s;tic of the gentler Sex, be intitled to excu&s;e, and more than excu&s;e?</P>
<P>He &s;aw my confu&s;ion. Let me not, my deare&s;t life, di&s;tre&s;s you, &s;aid he. Beautiful as your emotion is, I cannot enjoy it, if it give you pain. Yet is the que&s;tion &s;o important to me; &s;o much is my heart concerned in the favourable an&s;wer I hope for from your goodne&s;s; that I mu&s;t not let this opportunity &s;lip, except it be your plea&s;ure that I attend your de|termination from Mrs. Selby's mouth.&mdash;Yet <HI>that</HI> I choo&s;e not, neither; becau&s;e I pre&s;ume for more fa|vour from your own, than you will, on <HI>cold</HI> delibera|tion, allow your aunt to &s;hew me. Love will plead for its faithful votary in a &s;ingle brea&s;t, when con&s;ulta|tion on the &s;uppo&s;ed fit and unfit, the object ab&s;ent, will produce delay. But I will retire, for two mo|ments. You &s;hall be my pri&s;oner mean time. Not a &s;oul &s;hall come in to interrupt us, unle&s;s it be at your call. I will return, and receive your determination; and if that be the fixing of my happy day, how will you rejoice me!</P>
<P>While I was debating within my&s;elf, whether I &s;hould be angry or plea&s;ed, he returned, and found me walking about the room.&mdash;Soul of my hope, &s;aid he, taking with reverence my hand; I now pre&s;ume that you <HI>can,</HI> that you <HI>will,</HI> oblige me.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">
You have given me no time, Sir: But let me re|que&s;t, that you will not expect an an&s;wer, in relation to the early day you <HI>&s;o</HI> early a&s;k for, till after the re|ceipt of your next Letters from Italy. You &s;ee how the admirable Lady is urged; how reluctantly &s;he has given them but <HI>di&s;tant</HI> hopes of complying with their wi&s;hes. I &s;hould be glad to wait for the next Let|ters; for tho&s;e, at lea&s;t, which will be an an&s;wer to yours, acquainting them, that there is a woman with whom you think you could be happy. I am earne&s;t in this reque&s;t, Sir. Think it not owing to affecta|tion.</P>
<P>I acquie&s;ce, madam. The an&s;wer to tho&s;e Letters will &s;oon be here. It will indeed be &s;ome time before I can receive a reply to that I wrote in an&s;wer to Je|ronymo's la&s;t Letter. I impute not affectation to my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron. I can ea&s;ily comprehend your motive: It is a generous one. But it be&s;its me to &s;ay, that the next Letters from Italy, whatever may be their contents, can <HI>now</HI> make no alteration on my part. Have I not declared my&s;elf to your friends, to you, and to the world?</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, they may make an alteration on mine, highly as I think of the honour Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on does me by his good opinion. For, pardon me, &s;hould the mo&s;t excellent of women think of re|&s;uming a place in your heart&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me interrupt you, madam.&mdash;It cannot <HI>be,</HI> that Lady Clementina, proceeding, as &s;he has done, on motives of piety, zealous in her religion, and all her relations now earne&s;t in another man's favour, can alter her mind. I &s;hould not have acted with ju&s;tice, with gratitude, to her, had I not tried her &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s by every way I could devi&s;e: Nor, in ju&s;tice to <HI>both</HI> Ladies, would I allow my&s;elf to apply for <HI>your</HI> favour till I had <HI>her</HI> re&s;olution confirmed to me under her own hand after my arrival in England. But were it <HI>now</HI> po&s;&s;ible that &s;he &s;hould vary, and were you, madam,
<PB N="148" REF="149">
to hold your determination in my favour &s;u&s;pended; the con&s;equence would be this; I &s;hould never, while that &s;u&s;pence la&s;ted, be the hu&s;band of <HI>any woman on earth.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, Sir, you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed. I did not think you would &s;o <HI>&s;oon</HI> be &s;o <HI>very</HI> earne&s;t. But this, Sir, I &s;ay, Let me have rea&s;on to think, that my hap|pine&s;s will not be the misfortune of a more excellent woman, and it &s;hall be my endeavour to make the man happy who <HI>only</HI> can make me &s;o.</P>
<P>He cla&s;ped me in his arms with an ardor&mdash;that di&s;|plea&s;ed me not&mdash;on reflexion&mdash;But at the time &s;tartled me. He then thanked me again on one knee. I held out the hand he held not in his, with intent to rai&s;e him; for I could not &s;peak. He received it as a token of favour; ki&s;&s;ed it with ardor; aro&s;e; <HI>again</HI> pre&s;&s;ed my cheek with his lips. I was too much &s;ur|pri&s;ed to repul&s;e him with anger: But was he not too free? Am I a prude, my dear? In the odious &s;en&s;e of the abu&s;ed word, I am &s;ure, I am not: But in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, as derived from <HI>prudence,</HI> and u&s;ed in oppo&s;ition to a word that denotes a wor&s;e character, I own my|&s;elf one of tho&s;e who would wi&s;h to re&s;tore it to its natural re&s;pectable &s;ignification, for the &s;ake of virtue; which, as Sir Charles him&s;elf once hinted <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vol. IV. p. 139.</NOTE>, is in danger of &s;uffering by the abu&s;e of it; as Religion once did, by that of the word <HI>Puritan.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Charles, on my making towards the door that led to the &s;tairs, withdrew with &s;uch a grace, as &s;hewed he was capable of recollection.</P>
<P>Again I a&s;k, was he not too free? I will tell you how I judge that he was: When I came to conclude my narrative to my aunt and Lucy, of all that pa&s;&s;ed between him and me, I blu&s;hed, and could not tell them how free he was. Yet you &s;ee, Ladies, that I can write it to you two.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, my uncle, and Mr. Deane, took a
<PB N="149" REF="150">
little walk, and returned ju&s;t as dinner was ready. My uncle took me a&s;ide, and whi&s;pered to me; I am glad at my heart and &s;oul the ice is broken. This is the man of true &s;pirit&mdash;<HI>Ads-heart,</HI> Harriet, you will be Lady Grandi&s;on in a fortnight, at furthe&s;t, I hope. You have had a charming <HI>confabulation,</HI> I doubt not. I can gue&s;s you have, by Sir Charles's declaring him|&s;elf more and more delighted with you. And he owns, that he put the que&s;tion to you.&mdash;Hay, Harriet!&mdash;Smiling in my face.</P>
<P>Every one's eyes were upon me. Sir Charles, I believe, &s;aw me look as if I were apprehen&s;ive of my uncle's raillery. He came up to us: My dear Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, in my uncle's hearing, I have owned to Mr. Selby, the reque&s;t I pre&s;umed to make you. I am afraid that he, as well as you, think me too bold and forward. If <HI>you</HI> do, madam, I a&s;k your pardon: My hopes &s;hall always be controuled by your plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>This made my uncle complai&s;ant to me. I was re-a&s;&s;ured. I was plea&s;ed to be &s;o &s;ea&s;onably re|lieved.</P>

<P>YOU mu&s;t not, my dear Ladies, expect me to be &s;o <HI>very</HI> minute: if I am, mu&s;t I not lo&s;e a hundred charming conver&s;ations? One, however, I will give you a little particularly.</P>
<P>Your brother de&s;ired leave to attend me in my dre&s;&s;ing-room&mdash;But how can I attempt to de&s;cribe his air, his manner, or repeat the thou&s;and agreeable things he &s;aid? In&s;en&s;ibly he fell into talking of future &s;chemes, in a way that punctillo it&s;elf could not be di&s;plea&s;ed with.</P>
<P>He had been telling me, that our dear Mr. Deane, having been affected by his la&s;t indi&s;po&s;ition had de|&s;ired my uncle, my aunt, and him, to permit him to lay before them the &s;tate of this affairs, and the kind things he intended to do by his own relations; who
<PB N="150" REF="151">
however, were all in happy circum&s;tances. After which, he in&s;i&s;ted upon Sir Charles's being his &s;ole executor, which he &s;crupled, unle&s;s &s;ome other per&s;on were joined with him in the tru&s;t: But Mr. Deane, being very earne&s;t on this head, Sir Charles &s;aid, I hope I know my own heart. My dear Mr. Deane, you mu&s;t do as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>After &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid I, the good man will not part with us till the beginning of next week.</P>
<P>Whenever you leave him, an&s;wered he, it will be to his regret; it may therefore as well be &s;oon: But I am &s;orry, methinks, that he, who has qualities which endear him to every one, &s;hould be &s;o much alone as he is here. I have a great de&s;ire, when I can be &s;o happy as to find my&s;elf a &s;ettled man, to draw into my neighbourhood friends who will dignify it. Mr. Deane will, I hope, be often our vi&s;iter at the Hall. The love he bears to his dear god-daughter will be his inducement; and the air and &s;oil being more dry and whol&s;ome than this &s;o near the fens, may be a means to prolong his valuable life.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett, continued he, has already carried into execution &s;ome &s;chemes which relate to my indigent neighbours, and the lower cla&s;s of my tenants. How does that excellent man revere Mi&s;s Byron!&mdash;My Beauchamp, with our two &s;i&s;ters and their Lords, will be often with us. Your worthy cou&s;in Reeves's, Lord W. and his de&s;erving Lady, will al&s;o be our vi|&s;iters, and we theirs, in turn. The Mansfield family are already within a few miles of me: And our Northampton&s;hire friends!&mdash;Vi&s;iters and vi&s;ited&mdash;What happine&s;s do I propo&s;e to my&s;elf, and the beloved of my heart!&mdash;And if (as you have generou&s;ly wi&s;hed) the dear Clementina may be happy, at lea&s;t not un|happy, and her brother Jeronymo recover? what, in this world, can be wanting to crown our felicity?</P>
<P>Tears of joy &s;trayed down my cheek, unperceived

by me, till they fell upon his hand, as it had mine in it. He ki&s;&s;ed them away. I was aba&s;hed. If my dear Mi&s;s Byron permit me to go on, I have her ad|vice to a&s;k.&mdash;I bowed my a&s;&s;ent. My heart throbbed with painful joy: I could not &s;peak.</P>
<P>Will <HI>it not be too early,</HI> madam, to a&s;k you about &s;ome matters of dome&s;tic concern? The lea&s;e of the hou&s;e in St. James's Square is expired. Some diffi|culties are made to renew it, unle&s;s on terms which I think unrea&s;onable. I do not ea&s;ily &s;ubmit to impo|&s;ition. Is there any-thing that you particularly like in the &s;ituation of that hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Hou&s;es, Sir, nay, Countries, will be alike to me, in the company of tho&s;e I value.</P>
<P>You are all goodne&s;s, madam. I will leave it to my &s;i&s;ters, to enquire after another hou&s;e. I hope you will allow them to con&s;ult you, as any one may offer. I will write to the owner of my pre&s;ent hou&s;e (who is &s;olicitous to know my determination, and &s;ays he has a tenant ready, if I relinqui&s;h it) that it will be at his command in three months time. When my dear Mi&s;s Byron &s;hall ble&s;s me with her hand, and our Northampton&s;hire friends will part with her, if &s;he plea&s;es, we will go directly to the Hall.</P>
<P>I bowed, and intended to look as one who thought her&s;elf obliged.</P>
<P>Re&s;train, check me, madam, whenever I &s;eem to tre&s;pa&s;s on your goodne&s;s. Yet how &s;hall I forbear to wi&s;h you to ha&s;ten the day that &s;hall make you wholly mine?&mdash;You will the rather allow me to wi&s;h it, as you will then be more than ever your own mi&s;tre&s;s; tho' you have always been generou&s;ly left to a di&s;cre|tion that never was more de&s;ervedly tru&s;ted to. Your will, madam, will ever comprehend mine.</P>
<P>You leave me, Sir, only room to &s;ay, that if gra|tiude can make me a merit with you, <HI>that</HI> began with the fir&s;t knowlege I had of you; and it has been in|crea&s;ing ever &s;ince&mdash;I hope I never &s;hall be ungratefull
<PB N="152" REF="153">
Tears again &s;trayed down my check. Why did I weep?</P>
<P>Delicate &s;en&s;ibility! &s;aid he. He cla&s;ped his arms about me&mdash;But in&s;tantly withdrew them, as if recol|lecting him&s;elf&mdash;Pardon me, madam! Admiration will &s;ometimes mingle with reverence. I mu&s;t ex|pre&s;s my gratitude as a man&mdash;May my happy day be not far di&s;tant, that I may have no bound to my joy!&mdash;He took my hand, and again pre&s;&s;ed it with his lips. My heart, madam, &s;aid he, is in your hand: You cannot but treat it graciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in my Nancy [Why came &s;he in?] with the general expectation of us to break|fa&s;t!&mdash;Breakfa&s;t!&mdash;What, thought I, is breakfa&s;t!&mdash;The <HI>world,</HI> my Charlotte&mdash;But hu&s;h!&mdash;Withdraw, fond heart, from my pen! Can the <HI>deare&s;t</HI> friend al|low for the acknowlegement of impul&s;es &s;o fervent, and which, writing to the moment, as I may &s;ay, the moment only can ju&s;tify revealing?</P>
<P>He led me down-&s;tairs, and to my very &s;eat, with an air <HI>&s;o</HI> noble, yet <HI>&s;o</HI> tender&mdash;My aunt, my Lucy, every-body&mdash;looked at me. My eyes betrayed my hardly-conquered emotion.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's looks and behaviour were &s;o re&s;pectful, that every one addre&s;&s;ed me as a per&s;on of increa&s;ed con&s;equence. Do you think, Lady G. that Lord G's and Lord L's re&s;pectful behaviour to their wives do not as much credit to their own hearts, as to their Ladies? How happy are you, that you have recollected your&s;elf, and now encourage not others, by your ex|ample, to make a je&s;t of a <HI>hu&s;band</HI>'s Love!&mdash;Will you forgive me the recollection, for the &s;ake of the joy I have in the reformation?&mdash;</P>
<P>I HAVE read this Letter, ju&s;t now, to my aunt and Lucy, all except this la&s;t &s;aucy hint to you. They cla&s;ped me each in their arms, and &s;aid, They ad|mired <HI>him,</HI> and were plea&s;ed with <HI>me.</HI> In&s;truct me, my dear Ladies, how to behave in &s;uch a manner, as

may &s;hew my gratitude (I had almo&s;t &s;aid my Love); yet not go &s;o very far, as to leave the day, the hour every-thing, to his determination!</P>
<P>But, on reading to my aunt and Lucy what I had written, I was a&s;hamed to find, that when he was enumerating the friends he hoped to have near him, or about him, I had forgot to remind him of my Emily. Ungrateful Harriet!&mdash;But don't tell her that I was &s;o ab&s;orbed in Self, and that the conver&s;ation was &s;o in|tere&s;ting, that my heart was more of a pa&s;&s;ive than an active machine at the time. I will &s;oon <HI>find,</HI> or <HI>make,</HI> an occa&s;ion to be her &s;olicitre&s;s. You once thought that Emily, for her <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, &s;hould not live with us; but her heart is &s;et upon it. Dear creature! I love her! I will &s;ooth her! I will take her to my bo&s;om!&mdash;I will, by my &s;i&s;terly compa&s;&s;ion, intitle my&s;elf to all her confidence! She &s;hall have all mine. Nor &s;hall her guardian &s;u&s;pect her.&mdash;I will be as faith|ful to her &s;ecret, as you and Lady L. were (thankfully I remember it!) to mine. Don't you think, my dear, that if Lady Clementina [I how to her merit whenever I name her to my&s;elf] had had &s;uch a true, &s;uch a &s;oothing friend, to whom &s;he could have re|vealed the &s;ecret that oppre&s;&s;ed her noble heart, while her pa&s;&s;ion was young, it would have been attended with &s;uch a deprivation of her rea&s;on, as made unhappy all who had the honour of being related to her?</P>

<P>I WAS all confu&s;ion when he, looking as uncon|&s;cious as he u&s;ed to do, entred my dre&s;&s;ing-room. I turned my face from him. He &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at my concern. Mi&s;s Byron, I hope, is well. Has any|thing di&s;turbed you, madam?</P>
<P>My paper, my paper! You took it up&mdash;For the world I would not&mdash;The poor Emily!&mdash;Give it me; Give it me; and I bur&s;t into tears.&mdash;</P>
<P>Was there ever &s;uch a fool? What bu&s;ine&s;s had I to name Emily;</P>
<P>He took it out of his pocket. I came to give it to you; putting it into my hand. I &s;aw it was your writing, madam: I folded it up immediately: It has not been unfolded &s;ince: Not a &s;ingle &s;entence did I permit my&s;elf to read.</P>
<P>Are you &s;ure, Sir, you have not read it? nor any</P>
<P>Part of it!&mdash;</P>
<P>Upon my honour, I have not.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156">
I cleared up at once. A ble&s;&s;ed reward, thought I, for denying my own curio&s;ity, when pre&s;&s;ed by my Charlotte, to read a Letter clande&s;tinely obtained!</P>
<P>A thou&s;and, thou&s;and thanks to you, Sir, for not giving way to your curio&s;ity. I &s;hould have been mi&s;erable, perhaps, for months, had you read that paper.</P>
<P>You now indeed rai&s;e my curio&s;ity, madam. Per|haps your genero&s;ity will permit you to gratify it; tho' I &s;hould not have forgiven my&s;elf, had I taken advantage of &s;uch an accident.</P>
<P>I will tell you the contents of &s;ome parts of it, Sir.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which relate to my Emily, if you plea&s;e, madam. The <HI>poor</HI> Emily, you &s;aid.&mdash;You have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">amed me.

<P>And his face glowed, with impatience.</P>
<P>No harm, Sir, of Emily!&mdash;Only a reque&s;t of the dear girl! [What letter u&s;e could I have made of my fright, Lady G?] But the <HI>manner</HI> of my mentioning it, I would not for the world you &s;hould have &s;een.</P>
<P>No harm, you &s;ay!&mdash;I was afraid, by your concern for her&mdash;But can <HI>you</HI> love her, as well as ever? If you can, Emily mu&s;t &s;till be good.</P>
<P>I can: I do.</P>
<P>What then, dear madam, of <HI>poor</HI> Emily? Why <HI>poor</HI> Emily?&mdash;</P>
<P>I will tell you. The dear girl makes it her reque&s;t, that I will procure of you one favour for her: Her heart is &s;et upon it.</P>
<P>If Emily continue good, &s;he &s;hall only &s;ignify her wi&s;h, and I will comply. If <HI>I</HI> am not a Father to her, is &s;he not fatherle&s;s?</P>
<P>Allow me, Sir, to call you kind! good! hu|mane!</P>
<P>What I want of tho&s;e qualities, Mi&s;s Byron will

<P>She would live with her guardian, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>With <HI>me,</HI> madam?&mdash;And with <HI>you,</HI> madam&mdash;Tell me, own to me, madam, <HI>And</HI> with you?</P>
<P>That is her wi&s;h&mdash;</P>
<P>And does my beloved Mi&s;s Byron think it a <HI>right</HI> wi&s;h to be granted; Will <HI>&s;he</HI> be the in&s;tructing friend, the examplary &s;i&s;ter, now in that time of the dear girl's life, when the eye, rather than the judgment, is u&s;ually the director of a young woman's affections?</P>
<P>I love the &s;weet Innocent: I could wi&s;h her to be always with me.</P>
<P>Obliging goodne&s;s! Then is one of my cares over. A young woman, from Fourteen to Twenty, is often a trouble&s;ome charge upon a Friendly heart. I could not have a&s;ked this favour of you. You rejoice me by mentioning it. Shall I write a Letter, in your name, to Emily?</P>
<P>There, Sir, is pen, ink, and paper.</P>
<P>In <HI>your</HI> name, madam?</P>
<P>I bowed a&s;&s;ent; mi&s;tru&s;ting nothing.</P>

<P>Charming confidence!&mdash;What mu&s;t he be, who could attempt to abu&s;e it?&mdash;Read, madam, what you have &s;igned.&mdash;</P>

If you are there in le&s;s than a fortnight, I will endeavour to be with you in a fortnight after. I &s;acrifice, at lea&s;t, another fortnight's punctilio to oblige you.

<P>Have I forfeited my character with you, madam?&mdash;holding it back, with an air of re&s;pectful gaiety.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t con&s;ider, Sir, before I give you an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>If I have, why &s;hould I not &s;end it away; and, as Mi&s;s Byron cannot deny her hand-writing, hope to receive the benefit of the &s;uppo&s;ed deceit? E&s;pecially as it will an&s;wer &s;o many good ends: For in&s;tance, your own wi&s;hes in Emily's favour; as it will increa&s;e your own power of obliging; and be a means of ac|celerating the happine&s;s of a man who&s;e principal joy will be in making you happy.</P>
<P><HI>Was</HI> it not a pretty piece of deceit, Lady G? Shall I own, that my heart was more inclined to re|ward than puni&s;h him for it? And really, for a mo|ment, I thought of the impracticablene&s;s of complying with the reque&s;t, as if I was &s;eriou&s;ly pondering upon it, and was &s;orry it was not practicable. To get away from my dear Mr. Deane, thought I, who will not be in ha&s;te to part with us; &s;ome female bu&s;tlings to be got over on our return to Selby-hou&s;e; propo&s;al renewed, and a little paraded with [Why, Lady G. did you tell me that our Sex is a fooli&s;h Sex?]; the preparation; the ceremony; the awful ceremony! the parting with the deare&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent

friends that ever young creaure was ble&s;&s;ed with; and to be at Grandi&s;on-hall, <HI>all</HI> within one month!&mdash;Was there ever &s;o precipitating a man?</P>
<P>I believe verily, that I appeared to him as if I were con&s;idering of it; for he took advantage of my &s;ilence, and urged me to permit him to &s;end away to Emily what he had written; and offered to give rea&s;ons for his urgency: Written as it is, &s;aid he, by me, and &s;igned by you, how will the dear girl rejoice at the con&s;ent of both, under our hands! And will &s;he not take the caution given her in it from me, as kindly as &s;he will your mediation in her favour?</P>
<P>Sure, Sir, &s;aid I, you expect not a &s;erious an&s;wer!&mdash;Upon his honour, he did&mdash;How, Sir! Ought you not rather to be thankful, if I forgive you, for letting me &s;ee that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on was capable of &s;uch an artifice, tho' but in je&s;t; and for his reflection upon me, and perhaps meant on our Sex, as if decorum were but <HI>punctilio?</HI> I beg my Lucy's pardon, added I, for being half-angry with her when &s;he called you a <HI>de&s;igner.</HI></P>
<P>My deare&s;t creature, &s;aid he, I <HI>am</HI> a de&s;igner. Who, to accelerate a happine&s;s on which that of his whole life depends, would not be innocently &s;o? I am, in this in&s;tance, &s;elfi&s;h: But I glory in my &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; be|cau&s;e I am determined, if power be lent me, that every one, within the circle of our acquaintance, &s;hall have rea&s;on to congratulate you as one of the happie&s;t of women.</P>
<P>Till this artifice, Sir, &s;hewed me what you <HI>could</HI> do, were you not a man of the &s;tricte&s;t honour, I had no|thing but affiance in you. Give me the paper, Sir; and, for your own &s;ake, I will de&s;troy it, that it may not furni&s;h me with an argument, that there is not <HI>one</HI> man in the world who is to be implicitly confided in by a woman.</P>
<P>Take it, madam (pre&s;enting it to me, with his u&s;ual gracefulne&s;s); de&s;troy it not, however, till you have

expo&s;ed me as <HI>&s;uch</HI> a breach of confidence <HI>de&s;erves,</HI> to your aunt, your Lucy&mdash;To your uncle Selby; and Mr. <HI>Deane,</HI> if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir! you know your advantages! I will not, in this ca&s;e, refer to them: I could &s;ooner rely, dearly as they love their Harriet, on Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's ju&s;tice, than on their favour, in <HI>any</HI> debate that &s;hould happen between him and me.</P>
<P>There never, madam, except in the ca&s;e before us, can be room for a reference: Your prudence, and my gratitude, mu&s;t &s;ecure us both. Even now, impatient as I am to call you mine, which makes me willing to lay hold of every opportunity to urge you for an early day, I will endeavour to &s;ubdue that impatience, and &s;ubmit to your will. Yet let me &s;ay, that if I did not think your heart one of the mo&s;t laudably unre&s;erved, yet truly delicate, that woman ever boa&s;ted, and your prudence equal, you would not have found me &s;o ac|quie&s;cent a Lover, early as you <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> my urgency for the happy day.</P>
<P>And is it <HI>not</HI> early, Sir? Can Sir Charles Grandi&s;on think me punctilious?&mdash;But you will permit me to write to Mi&s;s Jervois <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> and acquaint her with her granted wi&s;h, if&mdash;</P>
<P>If! No <HI>if,</HI> madam&mdash;Whatever you think right to be done, in this ca&s;e, that do. Emily will be more particularly your ward than mine, if you conde&s;cend to take the tru&s;t upon you.</P>
<P>You will be plea&s;ed, dear Lady G. to acquaint Emily with the grant of her wi&s;h: She will rejoice. God give the dear creature rea&s;on for joy; and then I &s;hall have double plea&s;ure in having contributed to her obtaining of it. But, on &s;econd thoughts, I will write to her my&s;elf; for I allow not that &s;he &s;hall &s;ee or hear read every-thing I write to you. [Shall I own to you, that my grandmamma, and aunt, and Lucy, are of your mind? They all three wi&s;h]&mdash;But who can deny the dear Innocent the grant of a reque&s;t on which &s;he

<P>Our dear Mr. Deane, tho' reluctantly, has con|&s;ented that we &s;hall leave him on Monday next. We &s;hall &s;et out directly for Selby-hou&s;e, where we pro|po&s;e to be the &s;ame night. My aunt and I have been urgent with him to go back with us; but he is cro&s;s, and <HI>will</HI> be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t now Lucy tells me, that Mr. Deane declared to my uncle, aunt, and her, that he will not vi&s;it us at Selby-hou&s;e till we &s;end for him and the &s;ettlements together, which he will have ready in a week&mdash;Strange expedition! Sure they are afraid your brother will change his mind, and are willing to put it out of the poor man's power to recede! Lucy &s;miles at me, and is &s;ure, &s;he &s;ays, that &s;he may in confidence re|veal all the&s;e matters to me, without endangering my <HI>life.</HI> My next Letter will be from Selby-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>While that life continues, my dear Ladies, look upon me as a&s;&s;uredly</P>

<P>GO on, go on, with your narratives, my dear. Hitherto Caroline and I know not how either
<PB N="161" REF="162">
much to blame you, or totally to acquit you of <HI>parade</HI> the man and his &s;ituation con&s;idered; and the &s;tate of your heart for &s;o many months pa&s;t; every one of your friends&mdash;con&s;enting, &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;<HI>more</HI> than con&s;enting&mdash;<HI>ardent,</HI> to be related to him. Hark ye, Harriet, let me whi&s;per you&mdash;My brother, whether he come hone&s;tly, or not, by his knowlege, I dare &s;ay, thinks not &s;o highly of the Free-ma&s;onry part of mar|riage as you do&mdash;You &s;tart. O Charlotte! you cry&mdash;And, O Harriet! too&mdash;But, my dear girl, let my brother &s;ee, that you think (and no woman in the world does, if you don't) that the true mode&s;ty, after hearts are united, is to think little of parade, and much of the &s;ocial happine&s;s that awaits two worthy minds united by Love, and conformity of &s;entiment&mdash;After all, we are &s;illy creatures, Harriet: We are afraid of wi&s;e men. No wonder that we &s;eldom choo&s;e them, when a fool offers. I wi&s;h I knew the man, however, who dare to &s;ay this in my hearing.</P>
<P>Your grandmother Shirley is more than woman: My brother prodigiou&s;ly admires her. I think you may tru&s;t to her judgment, if you &s;uppo&s;e him too precipitating. Your aunt is an excellent woman! But I never knew a woman or man, who valued them|&s;elves on delicacy, and found them&s;elves con&s;ulted upon it, but was apt to over-do the matter. Is not this a little, a <HI>very</HI> little, Mrs. Selby's ca&s;e? Let her know, that I bid you a&s;k this que&s;tion of her&s;elf: She mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ured that I equally love and honour her; &s;o won't be angry.</P>
<P>Your uncle is an odd, but a very hone&s;t Dun&s;table &s;oul! Tell him, I &s;ay &s;o; but withal, that he &s;hould leave women to act as <HI>women,</HI> in the&s;e matters. <HI>What a duce, what a pize,</HI> would he expect perfection from them? He, who&s;e arguments always run in the de|preciating &s;train? If he <HI>would,</HI> a&s;k him, <HI>Where</HI> &s;hould they have it, conver&s;ing, as they are obliged to do, with men? Men for their fathers, for their brothers,
<PB N="162" REF="163">
for their uncles&mdash;They <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be a <HI>little</HI> &s;illy, had they not a <HI>fund</HI> of &s;illine&s;s in them&s;elves.&mdash;But I would not have them be mo&s;t <HI>out</HI> in matters where they &s;hould be mo&s;t <HI>in.</HI></P>
<P>I think, however, &s;o does Lady L. that &s;o far as you have proceeded, you are tolerable; tho' not, half &s;o clever as he, con&s;idering &s;ituations. Upon my word, Harriet, allowing for every-thing, neither of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's &s;i&s;ters expected that their bro|ther would have made &s;o ardent, &s;o polite, a Lover. He is &s;o <HI>prudent</HI> a man, and that once had like to have been one of <HI>your,</HI> even <HI>your</HI> objections.&mdash;Yet &s;o nobly &s;incere&mdash;&s;o manly. O that my ape&mdash;But come, Harriet, as men go in this age of monkeys and Sir Foplings, Lord G. (for all <HI>you</HI> ) is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed. I, as a good wi&s;e ought, will take his part, whoever runs him down. Where much is not given, much, and-&s;o-forth&mdash;</P>
<P>I have told Emily the good news: I could not help it, tho' you promi&s;e to write to her.</P>
<P>Poor thing! &s;he is all ec&s;ta&s;y! &s;he is not the only one who &s;eeks, as her greate&s;t good, what may po&s;|&s;ibly prove her greate&s;t misfortune. But, for her &s;ake for your &s;ake, and my brother's, I hope, under your directing eye, and by prudent management (the flame &s;o young) a <HI>little</HI> cold water will do; and that if it <HI>will</HI> blaze, it may be directed towards Beauchamp's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Let me whi&s;per you again, Harriet&mdash;Young girls finding them&s;elves ve&s;ted with new powers, and a &s;et of new inclinations, turn their &s;taring eyes out of them&s;elves; and the fir&s;t man they &s;ee, they imagine, if he be a &s;ingle man, and but &s;impers at them, they mu&s;t receive him as a Lover: Then they return downca&s;t for ogle, that he may ogle on without inter|ruption. They are &s;oon brought to write an&s;wers to Letters which confe&s;s flames the writer's heart never felt. The girl doubts not her own gifts, her own
<PB N="163" REF="164">
con&s;equence; &s;he wonders that her father, mother, and other friends, never told her of the&s;e new-found excellencies: She is more and more beautiful in her own eyes, as he more and more flatters her. If her parents are <HI>a</HI> -ver&s;e, the girl is <HI>per</HI> -ver&s;e; and the more, the le&s;s di&s;cretion there is in her pa&s;&s;ion. She adopts the word <HI>con&s;tancy;</HI> &s;he declaims again&s;t <HI>per&s;e|cution;</HI> &s;he calls her idle flame, LOVE; which only was a Something &s;he knew not what to make of&mdash;and, like a wandering bee, had it not &s;ettled on this flower, would on the next, were it either bitter or &s;weet.</P>
<P>And this generally, with the thoughtle&s;s, is the be|ginning and progre&s;s of that formidable invader, mi&s;|called <HI>Love;</HI> a word very happily at hand, to help giddy creatures to talk with, and look without confu|&s;ion of face on, a man telling them a thou&s;and lyes, and hoping, perhaps by illaudable means, to attain an end not in <HI>it&s;elf</HI> illaudable, when duty and di&s;cretion are, the one the guide, the other the gentle re&s;traint.</P>
<P>But as to Emily&mdash;I depend on her <HI>principles,</HI> as well as on your affectionate di&s;cretion (when you will be plea&s;ed, among ye, to permit my brother <HI>to be actu|ally yours)</HI> for re&s;training her imagination. There never beat in Female bo&s;om an hone&s;ter heart. Poor thing! &s;he is <HI>but</HI> a girl! And who is the woman, or child, that looks on my brother without love and re|verence?</P>
<P>For Emily's &s;ake, you &s;ee, you mu&s;t not have too many of your hone&s;t uncle's <HI>circum-roundabouts.</HI> He makes us laugh. I love to have him angry with his Dame Selby. Dear Harriet! when your heart's quite at ca&s;e, give us the court&s;hip of the odd &s;oul to <HI>the light of his eyes; his</HI> oddne&s;s, and <HI>her</HI> delicay! A charming contra&s;t! You <HI>did</HI> help us to a little of it once <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 141, &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>, you know. Theirs, on the woman's &s;ide, could not be a match of Love at fir&s;t: But who &s;o happy as they? I am convinced, Harriet, that Love
<PB N="164" REF="165">
on one &s;ide, and di&s;cretion on the other, is enough in con&s;cience; and, in &s;hort, much better than Love on both: For what room can there be for di&s;cretion, in the latter ca&s;e? The man is guilty of an heterodoxy in Love, you know, who is <HI>prudent,</HI> or but &s;u&s;pected of being &s;o!&mdash;Ah! Harriet, Harriet! once more I &s;ay, we women are fooli&s;h creatures in our Love-affairs; and know not what's be&s;t for our&s;elves.&mdash;In your &s;tile&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Don't you think &s;o, Lucy?'</Q>&mdash;Yet I admire Lucy&mdash;She got over an improperly-placed Love; and now, her mad fit over [We have <HI>all</HI> little or much of it; <HI>begun,</HI> as I told you how] &s;he is <HI>&s;o</HI> cool, <HI>&s;o</HI> quiet, <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;edate&mdash;Yet once I make no doubt, looking forward to her pre&s;ent happy quie&s;cence, would have thought it a &s;tate of in&s;ipidity. Dearly do we love racketing; and, another whi&s;per, &s;ome of us to be racketed&mdash;But not <HI>you!</HI> you are an exception. Yes, to be &s;ure!&mdash;But I believe you'll think me mad.</P>
<P>We like my brother's little trick upon you in the Billet he wrote, and which you &s;igned, as if to Emily. You &s;ee how earne&s;t he is, my dear. I long for his next Letters from Italy. I think that is a lucky plea enough for you, if you &s;uppo&s;e parade nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>We have got Everard among us again. The &s;orry fellow&mdash;O Harriet! had you &s;een him, with his hat upon his two thumbs, bowing, cringing, blu&s;hing, confounded, when fir&s;t he came into my royal pre|&s;ence&mdash;But I, from my throne, extended the golden &s;ceptre to him, as I knew I &s;hould plea&s;e my brother by it. He &s;at down when I bid him, twi&s;ted his lips, curdled his chin, hemm'd, &s;tole a look of reve|rence at me, looked down when his eyes met mine; <HI>mine</HI> bold as innocence, <HI>his</HI> con&s;cious as guilt; hemm'd again, turned his hat about; then with one of his not quite-forgotten airs of pertne&s;s, putting it under his arm, &s;hook his ears, tried to look up, then his eye &s;unk again under my broader eye.&mdash;O my dear!&mdash;What a paltry creature is a man vice-bitten! and &s;en|&s;ible of detected folly, and obligation!</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">
Sir Charles has made a man of him, once more. His dre&s;s is as gay as ever; and, I dare &s;ay, he &s;truts as much in it as ever, in company that knows not how he came by it. <HI>He</HI> reformed!&mdash;Bad habits are of the Jeru&s;alem artichoke-kind; once planted, there is no getting them out of the ground.</P>
<P>Our good Dr Bartlett is al&s;o with us, at pre&s;ent: He is in hopes of &s;eeing my brother in town&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'In town,'</Q> Harriet!&mdash;and the great affair un-&s;olem|nized!&mdash;Woe be to you, if&mdash;But let's &s;ee how you act when left to your&s;elf. Prudent people, in other's matters are not always prudent in their own; e&s;pe|cially in their Love-affairs. A little over-nicety at &s;etting out, will carry them into a road they never intended to amble in; and then they are &s;ometimes obliged to the <HI>le&s;s</HI> prudent to put them in the path they &s;et out from. Remember, my dear, <HI>I</HI> am at hand, if you bewilder your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett tells us, that my brother has extricated this poor creature from his entanglements with his woman, by his interpo&s;ition only by Letter: Some money, I &s;uppo&s;e. The Doctor de&s;ires to be &s;ilent, on the means; but hints, however, that Everard will &s;oon be in circum&s;tances not unhappy.</P>
<P>I HAVE got the Doctor to explain him&s;elf. Every day produces &s;ome new in&s;tances of womens follies. What would poor battered rakes and younger bro|thers do, when on their la&s;t legs, were it not for good-natured widows?&mdash;Ay, and &s;ometimes for forward maids? This wretch, it &s;eems, has acquitted him&s;elf &s;o hand&s;omely in the di&s;charge of the 100<HI>l.</HI> which he owed to his wine-merchant's relict, and the Lady was &s;o full of acknowlegements, and obligations, and all that, for being paid but her due, that he has ventured to make addre&s;&s;es to her (Love, as it is called): and is well received. He behaves with more &s;pirit before her, I &s;uppo&s;e, than he does before me.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
The widow had a plain, diligent, hone&s;t man, be|fore. She has what is called <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> for&s;ooth, or be|lieves &s;he has. She thinks Mr. Grandi&s;on a finer gentleman than him who left her in a condition to be thougbt worthy of the addre&s;s of a gayer man. She prides her&s;elf, it &s;eems, in the relation that her mar|riage will give her to a man of Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on's character. Much <HI>wor&s;e</HI> rea&s;ons will have weight, when a woman finds her&s;elf inclined to change her condition. But Everard is very earne&s;t that my brother &s;hould know nothing of the matter till all is over: So you (as I) have this piece of news in confidence. Lady L. has not been told it. His cou&s;in, he &s;ays, who refu&s;ed him his intere&s;t with Mi&s;s Mansfield, Lady W's &s;i&s;ter, becau&s;e he thought a further time of probation, with regard to his avowed good re&s;olutions, nece&s;&s;ary, would perhaps, for the widow's &s;ake, if applied to, <HI>put a &s;poke in his wheel.</HI></P>
<P>Everard, I can hardly allow my&s;elf to call him Grandi&s;on, avows a vehement pa&s;&s;ion for the widow. She is <HI>rich.</HI>&mdash;When they are &s;et out together in <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> as &s;he calls it, trade, or bu&s;ine&s;s, her fir&s;t ri&s;e, quite forgot, what a gay, what a frolick dance will &s;he and her new hu&s;band, in a little while, lead up, on the grave of her poor, plain, de&s;pi&s;ed one!</P>
<P>'Tis well, 'tis well, my dear Harriet, that I have a multitude of faults my&s;elf [Witne&s;s, to go no fur|ther back, this Letter] or I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e nine parts of the world out of ten.</P>
<P>I find that Sir Charles, and Beauchamp, and Dr. Bartlett, corre&s;pond. Light is hardly more active than my brother, nor lightning more quick, when he has any-thing to execute that mu&s;t or ought to be done. I believe I told you early, that was a part of his character. You mu&s;t not then wonder, or be of|fended [Shall I u&s;e the word <HI>offended,</HI> my dear?] that you, in your turn, now he has found him&s;elf at liberty to addre&s;s you, &s;hould be affected by his adroitne&s;s
<PB N="167" REF="168">
and vivacity in your <HI>Femalities,</HI> as uncle Selby calls them: Aptly enough, I think; tho' I do not love that men &s;hould be &s;o impudent, as either to find us out, or abu&s;e us. You cannot always, were you to <HI>think</HI> him too precipitating, &s;eparate bad qualities from good in the &s;ame per&s;on; &s;ince, perhaps, the one is the con&s;titutional occa&s;ion of the other. Could he, for example, be half &s;o u&s;eful a friend as he is, if he were to dream over a Love-affair, as you would &s;eem to have him; in other words, gape over his ripened fruit till it dropt into his yaw-yaw-yawning mouth? He'll certainly get you, Harriet, within, or near, his pro|po&s;ed time. Look about you: He'll have you, before you know where you are. By <HI>book,</HI> as the &s;aying is, will he pull you to him, &s;truggle as you will (he has already got hold of you) <HI>or by crook;</HI> inviting, nay compelling you, by his genero&s;ity, gentle &s;hepherd|like, to nymph as gentle. What you do, therefore, do with &s;uch a grace as may pre&s;erve to you the ap|pearance of having it in your power to lay an obli|gation upon him. It is the opinion of both his &s;i&s;ters, that he values you more for your noble expan&s;ion of heart, and not ignorant, but generous frankne&s;s of manners, yet mingled with dignity; than for&mdash;even&mdash;your Beauty, Harriet&mdash;Whether you, who are in &s;uch full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every grace of per&s;on, care, as a woman, to hear of that, or not. His gay parterre &s;imilitude you remember, my dear. It is my firm belief, that tho&s;e are the greate&s;t admirers of fine flowers, who love to &s;ee them in their borders, and &s;eldome&s;t pluck the fading fragrance. The other wretches crop, put them in their bo&s;oms, and in an hour or two, ro&s;e, carnation, or whatever, after one parting &s;mell, throw them away.</P>
<P>He is very bu&s;y, where-ever he is. At his inn, I &s;uppo&s;e, mo&s;t. But he boa&s;ts not to you, or any|body, of what he does.</P>
<P>He writes now-and-then a Letter to aunt Nell, and
<PB N="168" REF="169">
&s;he is <HI>&s;o</HI> proud of the favour&mdash;Look you here, niece; Look you here!&mdash;But I &s;ha'n't &s;hew you <HI>all</HI> he writes.&mdash;On go the &s;pectacles&mdash;for &s;he will not for the world part with the Letter out of her hands.&mdash;She reads one paragraph, one &s;entence, then another&mdash;On and off go the &s;pectacles, while &s;he conjectures, explains, animadverts, applauds; and &s;o goes on till &s;he leaves not a line unread: Then folding it up carefully in its cover, puts it in her Letter or Ribband-ca&s;e, which &s;hall I call it? For having but few Letters to put in it, the ca&s;e is filled with bits and ends of ribbands, pat|terns, and-&s;o-forth, of all manner of colours, faded and fre&s;h; with intermingledoms of gold-beaters &s;kin, plai&s;ters for a cut finger, for a chopt lip, a kibe, per|haps for corns; which &s;he di&s;pen&s;es occa&s;ionally very bountifully, and values her&s;elf, as we &s;ee at &s;uch times by a double chin made triple, for being not unu&s;eful in her generation. Chide me, if you will; the hu|mour's upon me; hang me, if I care: You are only Harriet Byron, as yet. Change your name, and in|crea&s;e your con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I have written a long Letter already; and to what end? Only to expo&s;e my&s;elf, &s;ay you? True enough. But now, Harriet, to bribe you into pa&s;&s;ing a milder cen&s;ure, let me tell you all I can pick up from the Doctor, relating to my brother's matters. Bribe &s;hall I call this, or gratitude, for your free communica|tions.</P>
<P>Matters between the Mansfields and the Keelings are brought very forward. Hang particulars: No|body's affairs lie near my heart, but yours. The two families have already begun to vi&s;it. When my bro|ther returns, all the gentry in the neighbourhood are to be invited, to rejoice with the parties on the occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Be &s;o kind, my dear, as to di&s;mi&s;s the good man, as &s;oon as your punctilio will admit. We are con|tented, that while he lays him&s;elf out &s;o much in the
<PB N="169" REF="170">
&s;ervice of others, he &s;hould do &s;omething for him&s;elf. You, my dear, we look upon as a high reward for his many great and good actions. But as he is a man who has a deep &s;en&s;e of favours granted, and values not the ble&s;&s;ing the more, when it <HI>ought</HI> to be within his reach, becau&s;e it is dear (as is the ca&s;e of the &s;orry fellows in general) I would have you con&s;ider of it&mdash;that's all.</P>
<P>The Doctor tells me, al&s;o, that the wicked Bolton's ward is dead; and that every-thing is included, to Sir Charles's &s;atisfaction, with him; and the Mans|fields (rein&s;tated in all their rights) are once more a happy family.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave is in a lamentable way; Dr. Bartlett has great compa&s;&s;ion for him. Would you have <HI>me</HI> pity him, Harriet?&mdash;You would, you &s;ay&mdash;Well, then, I'll try for it: As it was by his means you and we, and my brother, came acquainted, I think I <HI>may.</HI> He is to be brought to town.</P>
<P>Poor Sir Harry Beauchamp! He is pa&s;t recovery. Had the phy&s;icians given him over when they fir&s;t undertook him, he might, they &s;ay, have had a chance for it.</P>
<P>I told you, that Emily's mother was turned Me|thodi&s;t. She has converted her hu&s;band. A &s;trange alteration! But it is natural for &s;uch &s;ort of people to pa&s;s from one extreme to another. Emily every now-and-then vi&s;its them. They are ready to wor&s;hip her for her duty and goodne&s;s. She is a lovely girl: She every day improves in her per&s;on, as well as in her mind. She is &s;ometimes with me; &s;ometimes with Lady L; &s;ometimes with aunt Eleanor; &s;ometimes with your Mrs. Reeves&mdash;We are ready to fight for her: But you will &s;oon rob all of us. She is pre|paring for her journey to you. Poor girl! I pity her. <HI>Such</HI> a conflict in her mind, between her love of you, and tenderne&s;s for her guardian! Her Anne has con|fe&s;&s;ed to me, that &s;he weeps one half of the night;
<PB N="170" REF="171">
yet forces her&s;elf to be lively in company&mdash;After the example of Mi&s;s Byron, &s;he &s;ays, when &s;he vi&s;ited you at Selby hou&s;e. I hope, my dear, all will be right. But to go to live with a beloved object&mdash;I don't under&s;tand it. You, Harriet, may. I never was in Love, God help me!</P>
<P>I am afraid the dear girl does too much for her mother. As they have &s;o hand&s;ome an annuity, 400 <HI>l.</HI> a year, &s;o much beyond their expectation; I think &s;he &s;hould not give, nor &s;hould they receive, any-thing con&s;iderable of her, without her guardian's knowlege. She is laying out a great deal of money in new cloaths, to do you and her guardian credit&mdash;on your nuptials, poor thing! &s;he &s;ays, with tears in her eyes&mdash;but whether of joy, or &s;en&s;ibility, it is hard to decide; but I believe of both.</P>
<P>What makes me imagine &s;he does more than &s;he &s;hould, is, that a week ago &s;he borrowed fifty guineas of me; and but ye&s;terday came to me&mdash;I &s;hould do a very wrong thing, &s;aid &s;he, blu&s;hing up to the ears, &s;hould I a&s;k Lady L. to lend me a &s;um of money till my next quarter comes due, after I made my&s;elf your debtor &s;o lately: But if you <HI>could</HI> lend me thirty or forty guineas more, you would do me a great fa|vour.</P>
<P>My dear! &s;aid I; and &s;tared at her!</P>
<P>Don't que&s;tion, don't chide me, this one time. I never will run in debt again: I hate to be in debt. But you have bid me tell you all my wants.</P>
<P>I will not, my love, &s;ay another word. I will fetch you fifty guineas more.</P>
<P><HI>More,</HI> my dear Lady G! that is a pretty rub: But I will always, for the future, be within bounds: And don't let my guardian know it&mdash;He would kill me, by his genero&s;ity; yet perhaps, in his own heart, wonder what I did with my money. If <HI>he</HI> thought ill of me, or that I was extravagant, it would break my heart.</P>
<P>Only, my dear, &s;aid I, remember that 400 <HI>l.</HI> a
<PB N="171" REF="172">
year&mdash;Mrs. O-Hara cannot want any-thing to be done for her now.</P>
<P>Don't call her Mrs. O-Hara! She is very good: Call her my mother.</P>

<P>I thought it not ami&s;s to give you this hint, my dear, again&s;t &s;he goes down to you. But do you think it right, after all, to have her with my brother and you?</P>
<P>Lady L. keeps clo&s;e&mdash;She fa&s;ts, cries, prays, is va&s;tly apprehen&s;ive: She makes me unea&s;y for her and my&s;elf. The&s;e vile men! I believe I &s;hall hate them all.

<P>Don't Laugh at us, Harriet, in our mortified &s;tate [Begone, wretch&mdash;<HI>What have I done, madam?</HI> &s;tare|ing!

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXVIII.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON,</HI> To Lady <HI>G.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedn. Evening, Oct. <HI>25.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FIE upon you, Lady G! What a Letter have you written! There is no &s;eparating the good from the bad in it. With what dangerous talents are you entru&s;ted! and what u&s;e do you make of them! I have written two long Letters, continuing my nar|rative of our proceedings; but I mu&s;t take you to &s;evere ta&s;k for this before me; and <HI>this</HI> and <HI>they</HI> &s;hall go together.</P>
<P>Wicked wit! What a foe art thou to decent chear|fulne&s;s!&mdash;In a <HI>woman</HI>'s hand &s;uch a weapon! What might we not expect from it, were it in a man's? How you ju&s;tify the very creatures of that Sex, whom you would be thought to de&s;pi&s;e!</P>
<P>But you &s;ay, you would not allow in a man, the li|berties you your&s;elf take with your own Sex. How can you, my dear, be &s;o partial to your faults, yet own them to be &s;uch? Would you rank with the wor&s;t of &s;inners? They do ju&s;t &s;o.</P>
<P>I may be a fool: I may be incon&s;i&s;tent: I may not know how with a grace to give effect to my own wi&s;hes: I may be able to advi&s;e better than act&mdash;Mo&s;t pragmatical creatures think they can be coun&s;ellors in another's ca&s;e, while their own affairs, as my uncle would &s;ay, <HI>lie at &s;ixes and &s;evens.</HI> But how does this excu&s;e your freedoms with your whole Sex&mdash;With the Innocents of it, more particularly?</P>
<P>Let me &s;ay, my dear, that you take odious, yes, <HI>odious,</HI> liberties; I won't recal the word: Liberties which I cannot, tho' to &s;hame you, repeat. Fie upon you, Charlotte!</P>
<P>And yet you &s;ay, that neither you nor Lady L. know how to blame me much, tho', the man con|&s;idered,
<PB N="173" REF="174">
you will not totally acquit me of parade; and in another place, that &s;o far as we have proceeded, we have behaved tolerably. Why, then, all this riot?&mdash;yes, riot, Charlotte! again&s;t us, and again&s;t our Sex? <HI>What,</HI> but for riot's &s;ake?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'The humour upon you!'</Q>&mdash;The humour is upon you, with a witne&s;s! <Q REND="inline">'Hang you, if you care!'</Q>&mdash;But, my dear, it would be more to your credit if you <HI>did</HI> care; and if you checked the wicked humour.&mdash;Do you think nobody but you has &s;uch talents? Fain would I lower you, &s;ince, as it is evident, you take pride in your <HI>licence</HI>&mdash;Forgive me, my dear&mdash;Yet I will not &s;ay all I think of your wicked wit. Think you, that there are not many who could be as &s;mart, as &s;urpri&s;ing, as you, were they to indulge a vein of what you call humour? Do you think your brother is not one? Would not he be too hard for you at your own weapons? Has he not convinced you that he could? But he, a <HI>man,</HI> can check the overflowing freedom.</P>
<P>But if I <HI>have</HI> &s;et out wrong with your brother, I will do my endeavour to recover my path. You greatly oblige me with your conducting hand: But what nece&s;&s;ity was there for you to lead me through briars and thorns, and to plunge me into two or three dirty puddles, in order to put me into the right path, when it lay before you in a direct line, without going a bow-&s;hot about?</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed, however, to con&s;ider &s;ituation, on <HI>my</HI> &s;ide, as well as on your brother's: I might be a little excu&s;able for my aukwardne&s;s, perhaps, were it con|&s;idered, that the notion of a <HI>double</HI> or <HI>divided Love,</HI> on the man's part, came often into my head; indeed could not be long out; the Lady &s;o &s;uperlatively ex|cellent! his affection for her, &s;o <HI>allowably,</HI> as well as <HI>avowedly,</HI> &s;trong! Was it po&s;&s;ible to avoid little jealou&s;ies, little petulancies, when &s;lights were ima|ginable? The more, for the excellency of the man;
<PB N="174" REF="175">
the more for my pa&s;t weakne&s;s of <HI>&s;o many months?</HI> I pretend not, my deare&s;t Charlotte, to be got above nature: I know I am a weak &s;illy girl: I am humbled in the &s;en&s;e I have of his and Clementina's &s;uperior merits. True Love will ever make a per&s;on think manly of him&s;elf, in proportion as &s;he thinks highly of the object. Pride will be up, &s;ometimes; but in the pull two ways, between that and mortification, a torn coat will be the con&s;equence: And mu&s;t not the <HI>tatterdemallion</HI> (What a new language will my uncle teach me!) then look &s;imply?</P>
<P>You bid me a&s;k my aunt&mdash;You bid me tell my uncle&mdash;Naughty Charlotte! I will a&s;k, I will tell, them, nothing. Pray write me a Letter next, that I can read to <HI>them.</HI> I &s;kipt this pa&s;&s;age&mdash;Read that&mdash;'um&mdash;'um&mdash;'um&mdash;Then &s;kipt again&mdash;Hey-day! What's come to the girl, cried my uncle? Can Lady G. write what Harriet cannot read? [There was a rebuke for you, Charlotte!] For the love of God, let me read it!&mdash;He bu&s;tled, laughed, &s;hook his &s;houl|ders, rubbed his hands, at the imagination&mdash;Some pretty roguery, I warrant: Dearly do I love Lady G. If you love me, Harriet, let <HI>me</HI> read; and once he &s;natched one of the &s;heets. I boldly &s;truggled with him for it&mdash;For &s;hame, Mr. Selby, &s;aid my aunt. My dear, &s;aid my grandmother, if your uncle is &s;o impetuous, you mu&s;t &s;hew him no more of your Let|ters.</P>
<P>He then gave it up&mdash;Con&s;ider, Charlotte, what a fine piece of work we &s;hould have had with my uncle, had he read it through!</P>
<P>But, let me &s;ee,&mdash;What are the parts of this wicked Letter, for which I can &s;incerely thank you?&mdash;O my dear, I cannot, cannot, without &s;oiling my fingers, pick them out&mdash;Your intelligences, however, are among tho&s;e which I hold for favours.</P>
<P>Poor Emily! that is a &s;ubject which delights, yet &s;addens, me&mdash;We are <HI>laudably</HI> fond of di&s;tingui&s;hing
<PB N="175" REF="176">
merit. But your brother's is &s;o dazling&mdash;Every wo|man is one's rival. But no more of my Emily! Dear creature! the &s;ubject pains me!&mdash;Yet I cannot quit it.&mdash;You a&s;k, If, after all, I think it right that &s;he &s;hould live with me?&mdash;What can I &s;ay? For <HI>her</HI> &s;ake, perhaps, it will not: Yet how is her heart &s;et upon it! For my own &s;ake, as there is no perfect happine&s;s to be expected in this life, I could be content to bear a little pain, were that dear girl to be either benefited or plea&s;ured by it. Indeed I love her, at my heart&mdash;And, what is more&mdash;I love my&s;elf for &s;o &s;incerely loving her.</P>
<P>In the wicked part of your Letter, what you write of your aunt Eleanor&mdash;But I have no <HI>patience</HI> with you, &s;inner as you are again&s;t light, and better know|lege! and derider of the infirmities, not of old maids, but of old age!&mdash;Don't you hope to live long, your|&s;elf? That worthy Lady wears not &s;pectacles, Char|lette, becau&s;e &s;he never was &s;o <HI>happy</HI> as to be married. Wicked Charlotte! to owe &s;uch obligation to the ge|nero&s;ity of good Lord G. for taking pity of you in time [Were you Four or Five-and-twenty when he honoured you with his hand at St. George's church?] and yet to treat him as you do, in more places than one, in this very Letter!</P>
<P>But I will tell you what I will do with this &s;ame &s;trange Letter&mdash;I will tran&s;cribe all the good things in it. There are many which both delight and in&s;truct; and &s;ome morning, before I dre&s;s for the day, I will [Sad ta&s;k, Charlotte! But it &s;hall be by way of pe|nance for &s;ome of my faults and &s;ollies!] tran&s;cribe the intolerable pa&s;&s;ages; &s;o make two Letters of it. One I will keep to &s;hew my friends here, in order to increa&s;e, if it be po&s;&s;ible, their admiration of my Charlotte; the bad one I will pre&s;ent to you. I know I &s;hall tran&s;cribe it in a violent hurry&mdash;Not much matter whether it be legible, or not&mdash;The <HI>hob|bling</HI> it will cau&s;e in the reading, will make it appear
<PB N="176" REF="177">
wor&s;e to you, than if you could read it as glibly as you write. If half of it <HI>be</HI> illegible, enough will be le&s;t to make you blu&s;h for the whole, and wonder what &s;ort of a pen it was that &s;omebody, unknown to you, put into your &s;tandi&s;h.</P>
<P>After all, &s;pare me not, my ever-dear, my ever|charming friend! &s;pare only your <HI>&s;elf:</HI> Don't let Charlotte run away from both G's. You will then be always equally &s;ure of my admiration and love. For dearly do I love you, with all your faults; &s;o dearly, that when I con&s;ider your faults by them&s;elves, I am ready to arraign my heart, and to think there is more of the roguery of my Charlotte in it than I will allow of.</P>
<P>One puni&s;hment to you, I intend, my dear&mdash;In all my future Letters, I will write as if I had never &s;een this your naughty one. Indeed I am in a kind of way, faulty or not, that I cannot get out of, all at once; but as &s;oon as I can, I will, that I may better ju&s;tify my di&s;plea&s;ure at &s;ome parts of your Letter, by the ob&s;ervance I will pay to others. That is a &s;weet &s;entence of my Charlotte's: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Change your name, and increa&s;e your con&s;equence.'</Q> Reflect, my dear&mdash;How naughty mu&s;t you have been, that &s;uch a charm|ing in&s;tance of goodne&s;s could not bribe to &s;pare you</P>

<P>MR. Deane would not go back with us. He laid a &s;trict charge upon me, at parting, not to be punctilious.</P>
<P>I am <HI>not,</HI> my dear Lady G. Do <HI>you</HI> think I am? The men are their own enemies, if they wi&s;h <HI>us</HI> to
<PB N="177" REF="178">
be open-hearted and &s;incere, and are not &s;o <HI>them&s;elves.</HI> Let them enable us to depend on their candour, as much as we may on that of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, and the women will be inexcu&s;able, who &s;hall play either the prude or coquet with them. You will &s;ay, I am very cunning, perhaps, to form at the &s;ame time a rule <HI>from,</HI> and an excu&s;e <HI>for,</HI> my own con|duct to this excellent man: But be that as it will, it is truth.</P>
<P>We &s;ent our duty la&s;t night to Shirley-manor; and expect every moment the dear parent there with us.</P>
<P>She is come. I will go down; and if I get her by my&s;elf, or only with my aunt and Lucy, I will tell her a thou&s;and thou&s;and agreeable things, which have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince la&s;t I had her tender ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>WE have had this Greville and this Fenwick here. I could very well have &s;pared them. Mi&s;s Orme came hither al&s;o, uninvited, to breakfa&s;t; a favour &s;he often does us. I knew not at fir&s;t how to be|have to Sir Charles before her: She looked &s;o jealous of him! &s;o cold! Under her bent brow &s;he looked at him: Yes, and No, were all her an&s;wers, with an air <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;tiff!&mdash;But this re&s;erve la&s;ted not above a quarter of an hour. Sir Charles addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to <HI>me,</HI> with &s;o much re&s;pect; to <HI>her,</HI> with &s;o polite a freedom; that &s;he could not hold her &s;hyne&s;s.</P>
<P>Her brow cleared up; her eyes looked larger, and more free: Her buttoned-up pretty mouth opened to a &s;mile: She an&s;wered, &s;he a&s;ked, que&s;tions; gave her required opinion on more topics than one, and was <HI>again</HI> all Mi&s;s Orme.</P>
<P>Every-body took great notice of Sir Charles's fine addre&s;s to her, and were charmed with him; for we all e&s;teem Mr. Orme, and love his &s;i&s;ter. How plea|&s;ant it was to &s;ee the &s;un&s;hine break out in her ami|able countenance, and the gloom vani&s;hing, by de|grees!</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179">
She took me out into the le&s;&s;er parlour&mdash;What a &s;trange variable creature am I! &s;aid &s;he: How I hated this Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, before I &s;aw him! I was vexed to find him, at fir&s;t &s;ight, an&s;wer what I had heard of him; for I was re&s;olved to di&s;like him, tho' he had been an angel! But, ah, my poor brother!&mdash;I am afraid, I my&s;elf &s;hall be ready to give up his in|tere&s;t!&mdash;No wonder, my dear Mi&s;s Byron, that no|body el&s;e would do, when you had &s;een this man!&mdash;But &s;till, let me be&s;peak your pity for my brother!&mdash;Would to Heaven you had not gone to London!&mdash;What went you thither for?</P>
<P>Sir Charles kindly enquired of her after Mr. Orme's health; prai&s;ed him for his character; wi&s;hed his re|covery; and to be allowed to cultivate the friend&s;hip of &s;o worthy a man: And all this with an air &s;o &s;in|cere;&mdash;But good men mu&s;t love one another.</P>
<P>SIR Charles has ju&s;t now declared to my aunt, that he thinks of going up to town, or to Grandi&s;on-hall, I forget if they told me which, to-morrow or next day: Perhaps he knows not <HI>to which</HI> him&s;elf. I was &s;urpri&s;ed. Perhaps he is tired with us. Let me re|collect&mdash;<HI>Thur&s;day was Se'nnight;</HI> Why indeed he has been down with us twelve days!&mdash;No le&s;s!</P>
<P>But he has no doubts, no &s;u&s;pences frum <HI>us,</HI> to keep Love awake: His path is plain and &s;mooth be|fore him. He has demanded his day: We think we cannot immediately, and after &s;o &s;hort a time pa&s;t &s;ince his declaring him&s;elf, give it him&mdash;And why &s;hould he lo&s;e his precious time among us? I &s;uppo&s;e he will be &s;o <HI>good</HI> as to hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s to obey <HI>our</HI> &s;um|mons&mdash;He expects a &s;ummons from <HI>us,</HI> perhaps!&mdash;</P>
<P>O my dear Lady G! am I not perver&s;e? I believe I am. Yet where there is room, from pa&s;t circum|&s;tances, to dread a &s;light, tho' none may be intended, and truly as I honour and revere Lady Clementina, my mind is not always great enough (perhaps from con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="179" REF="180">
of demerit) to carry it&s;elf above apprehen|&s;ion and petulance, noble as is the man.</P>
<P>My uncle is a little down upon it; and why? Be|cau&s;e, truly, my grandmamma has told him, that it is really too early yet to fix the day; and he reve|rences, as every body does, her judgment.</P>
<P>But why, he a&s;ks, cannot there be preparation making? Why may not &s;omething be &s;een <HI>going for|ward?</HI></P>
<P><HI>What?</HI> before the day is named? my aunt a&s;ks&mdash;As Harriet had de&s;ired to have his next Letters arrive before &s;he directly an&s;wered his que&s;tion, &s;he could <HI>not</HI> recede.</P>
<P>He went from them both greatly di&s;&s;atisfied, and exclaiming again&s;t womens love of power, and never knowing how to make a right u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>A me&s;&s;age from Sir Charles. He de&s;ires to attend me. I believe I &s;hall be a little &s;ullen: I know my heart: It is all his own; and I am <HI>loth</HI> to di&s;oblige him&mdash;But he was far, far more attendant on Lady Clementina's motions: Don't you think &s;o, Lady G? But &s;he was all excellence&mdash;Well&mdash;But hu&s;h!&mdash;I &s;ay no more!&mdash;</P>
<P>I WILL give you an account of our conver&s;ation. I verily believe, that, had he not touched the poor &s;nail with too ha&s;ty a &s;inger, which made her &s;hrink in again into her &s;hell, I might have been brought to name the week, tho' not the day.</P>
<P>But I will not anticipate.</P>
<P>He entered with a very polite and affectionate air. He enquired after my health, and &s;aid, I looked not well&mdash;Only <HI>vexed,</HI> thought I!</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, I believe, to hold di&s;plea&s;ure in the pre&s;ence of a beloved object, with whom we are not mortally offended. My deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, taking my pa&s;&s;ive hand, I am come to a&s;k your advice on twenty &s;ubjects. In the fir&s;t place, here is a Letter
<PB N="180" REF="181">
from Lady G. recommending to me a hou&s;e near her own [He gave it to me. I read it]. Should you, madam, approve of Gro&s;venor Square?</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent: You will gue&s;s how my captious folly appeared to him, by what he &s;aid to me. He re&s;pect|fully took my hand&mdash;Why &s;o &s;olemn, dear madam? Why &s;o &s;ilent? Has any-thing di&s;turbed you? Some little di&s;plea&s;ure &s;eems to hang upon that open counte|nance. Not at me, I hope?</P>
<P>Yes it <HI>is,</HI> thought I! But I did not intend you &s;hould &s;ee it.&mdash;I cleared up; and without an&s;wering his que&s;tion, &s;aid, It is in the neighbourhood of Lady L. I hope?</P>
<P>Thank you, madam, for that <HI>hope</HI>&mdash;It is. Nor far from your cou&s;in Reeves's.</P>
<P>I can have no objection, Sir.</P>
<P>I will refer my&s;elf, on this &s;ublect, if you plea&s;e, to my &s;i&s;ters, and Lord G. He values him&s;elf on his ta&s;te in hou&s;es and furniture, and will be delighted to be put into commi&s;&s;ion with my &s;i&s;ters on this occa|&s;ion: Or &s;hall I &s;tay till the happy day is over, and leave the choice wholly to your&s;elf?</P>
<P>Lady G. Sir, &s;eems plea&s;ed with the hou&s;e. She writes, that there is &s;omebody el&s;e about it. It may not, then, be to be had.</P>
<P>Shall I then commi&s;&s;ion her to take it directly?</P>
<P>What you plea&s;e, Sir.</P>
<P>He bowed to me, and &s;aid, Then that matter is &s;ettled. And now, madam, let me own all my arts. You would penetrate into them, if I did not. You &s;ee that the great que&s;tion is never out of my view&mdash;I cannot but hope and believe, that you are above re|garding <HI>mere</HI> punctilio.&mdash;Have you, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, thought, can you think, of &s;ome early weak, in which to fix my happy day?&mdash;Some preparation on your part, I pre&s;ume, will be thought nece&s;&s;ary: As to mine, were you to ble&s;s me with your hand next week, I &s;hould be aforehand in that particular.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182">
I was &s;ilent. I was con&s;idering how to find &s;ome middle way that &s;hould make non-compliance appear neither di&s;obliging, nor affected.</P>
<P>He looked up at me with Love and Tenderne&s;s in his a&s;pect; but, having no an&s;wer, proceeded:</P>
<P>Your uncle, madam, and Mr. Deane, will inform you, that the &s;ettlements are &s;uch as cannot be di&s;|approved of. I expect every day &s;ome &s;light tokens of my affection for my dear Mi&s;s Byron, which will be adorned by the lovely wearer: I have not been &s;o ex|travagant in them, as &s;hall make her think I build on toys for her approbation. She will allow me to give her my notions on this &s;ubject. In the article of per|&s;onal appearance, I think that propriety and degree &s;hould be con&s;ulted, as well as fortune. <HI>Our</HI> degree, <HI>our</HI> fortune, madam, is not mean? but I, who always wi&s;hed for the revival of Sumptuary Laws, have not &s;ought, in this article, to emulate Princes. In my own dre&s;s, I am generally a conformi&s;t to the fa&s;hion. Singularity is u&s;ually the indication of &s;omething wrong in judgment. I rather perhaps dre&s;s too &s;hewy, tho' a young man, for one who builds nothing on outward appearance: But my father loved to be dre&s;&s;ed. In matters which regard not morals, I choo&s;e to appear to his friends and tenants, as not doing di&s;credit to his magnificent &s;pirit <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;s Byron ob&s;erves, Vol. I.

I could not think it becoming, as tho&s;e perhaps do, who have the direction of the royal &s;tamp on the coin, to &s;et my face the contrary way to that of my predece&s;&s;or. In a word, all my father's &s;teps, in which I could tread, I did; and have cho&s;en rather to build upon, than demoli&s;h, his foun|dations.&mdash;But how does my vanity mi&s;lead me! I <HI>have</HI> vanity, madam; I have pride, and &s;ome con&s;equen|tial failings, which I cannot always get above: But,
<PB N="182" REF="183">
anxious as I ever &s;hall be for your approbation, my whole heart &s;hall be open to you; and every motive, every &s;pring of action, &s;o far as I can trace it, be it to my advantage or not, &s;hall be made known to you. Happy the day that I became acquainted with Dr. Bartlett! He will tell you, madam, that I am corrigi|ble. You mu&s;t perfect, by your &s;weet conver&s;ation, <HI>un</HI> -coupled with fear, what Dr. Bartlett has &s;o hap|pily begun; and I &s;hall then be more worthy of you than at pre&s;ent I am.</P>
<P>O, Sir, you do me too much honour! You mu&s;t be <HI>my</HI> monitor. As to the ornaments you &s;peak of, I hope I &s;hall always look upon &s;implicity of manners a grateful return to the man I &s;hall vow to honour, and a worthy behaviour to all around me, as my principal ornaments!</P>
<P>His eyes gli&s;tened. He bowed his face upon my hand, to hide, as I thought, his emotion. Excellent Mi&s;s Byron! &s;aid he: Then, after a pau&s;e, Now let me &s;ay, that I have the happine&s;s to find my humble application to you acceptable to every one of your friends.

I know not whether I could &s;o far have overcome my own &s;cruples in behalf of your delicay (placing my&s;elf, as per&s;ons always ought when they hope for favour, in the granter's place) as to &s;upplicate you &s;o <HI>&s;oon</HI> as I have done, but at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of a family, and for the &s;ake of a Lady, I mu&s;t ever hold dear. The world about you <HI>expects</HI> a &s;peedy celebration. I have not, I own, been back|ward to <HI>encourage</HI> the expectation: It was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal from it the motive of my coming down, as my abode was at an inn.

<P>To-morrow morning, when Sir Charles comes to breakfa&s;t, this paper will be pre&s;ented to him by my grandmamma.</P>
<P>I wonder whether Sir Charles writes to Dr. Bartlett an account of what pa&s;&s;es here. If he does, what would I give to &s;ee his Letters! and particularly, what he thinks of the little delays he meets with&punc; But do, dear Lady G. acquit me of affectation and parade. Indeed it is not that. I hope he him&s;elf acquits me, and cen&s;ures him&s;elf; for, upon my word, he is unrea&s;onably ha&s;ty.</P>
<P>I could not but expre&s;s a little curio&s;ity about his hint of Lady Olivia's favourable opinion of me, tho' not at the time; and he was &s;o good as to &s;hew me, and my grandmamma and aunt, a mo&s;t extraordinary character which &s;he gave me in a long Letter. I &s;aw it was a long Letter (I was very <HI>Eve-i&s;h,</HI> my dear). Lucy &s;aid afterwards, that I did <HI>&s;o leer</HI> at it: An ugly word, importing <HI>&s;line&s;s!</HI> and, after I was angry at my&s;elf for giving her the idea that put her upon ap|plying it, I chid her for u&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Lady Olivia writes &s;uch high things, my dear! I blu&s;hed&mdash;I did not, could not, de&s;erve them. I al|ways pitied her, you know; but now you cannot imagine how much more than ever I pitied her. Do all of us, <HI>indeed,</HI> as the men &s;ay, love flattery?&mdash;I did not think I did&mdash;I &s;hall find out all the <HI>obliquities</HI> of my heart, in time. I was &s;uppo&s;ed once to be &s;o <HI>good</HI> a creature&mdash;as if none other were half &s;o good!&mdash;Ah, my partial friends! you &s;tudied your Harriet in the dark; but here comes the &s;un darting into all the

crooked and ob&s;cure corners of my heart; and I &s;hrink from his dazling eye; and, compared to Him (and <HI>Clementina,</HI> let me add) appear to my&s;elf &s;uch a Nothing&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, I have had the mortification, once or twice, to think my&s;elf le&s;s than the very Olivia, upon whom, but lately, &s;ecure of my mind's &s;uperiority to her mind, I looked down with a kind of proud compa&s;|&s;ion: And whence this exaltation of Olivia, and &s;elf-humiliation?&mdash;Why, from her magnifying beyond mea&s;ure the poor Harriet, and yielding up her own hopes, entreating him, as &s;he does, to addre&s;s me; and that with &s;uch honourable di&s;tinction, as if my acceptance of him were doubtful, and a conde&s;cen|&s;ion.</P>

<P>SIR Charles came not this morning till we were all a&s;&s;embled for breakfa&s;t. I had begun to think, whether, if I had been Sir Charles, and he had been Mi&s;s Byron, I would not have been here an hour be|fore, expecting the deci&s;ion of the judges to whom a
<PB N="194" REF="195">
certain cau&s;e was referred. O my dear Lady G.! how narrow minded I am, with all my quondam he|roi&s;m! The knowlege of his pa&s;t engagements with the excellent Clementina, and of his earne&s;t wi&s;hes then to be hers, makes me, on every occa&s;ion that can be tortured into an appearance of neglect or coldne&s;s, <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;illy!&mdash;Indeed I am a&s;hamed of my&s;elf. But all my petulance was di&s;pelled, the in&s;tant he &s;hone upon us.</P>
<P>Well, my dear Ladies, &s;aid he, the moment he took his place, whi&s;peringly to my grandmamma (who &s;at between my aunt and Lucy), Is &s;entence given?</P>
<P>It is, Sir Charles&mdash;He took my hand, cro&s;s my Nancy's lap, as &s;he &s;at between him and me&mdash;I have hopes, my dear Mi&s;s Byron [from the fooli&s;hne&s;s in my looks, I &s;uppo&s;e] that you are <HI>ca&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Have patience, Sir, &s;aid I&mdash;It is well that the be&s;t of us are not always to be our own carvers.</P>
<P>He looked, Lucy &s;aid afterwards, with eyes of love upon me, and of apprehen&s;ion on his judges; and the di&s;cour&s;e turned upon different &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I retired as &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over; and he de|manded his &s;entence.</P>
<P>My uncle was, as he called it, <HI>turned out of door</HI> before my grandmamma gave your brother the paper.</P>
<P>Sir Charles read it&mdash;You are not &s;erious upon it, Sir Charles, &s;aid my grandmamma.&mdash;I am infinitely obliged to you, Ladies, replied he. I love to argue with my dear Mi&s;s Byron: I mu&s;t attend her, this moment.</P>
<P>He &s;ent up Sally before him, and came up. I was in my clo&s;et; and &s;crupled not to admit him.</P>
<P>Henceforth, my deare&s;t dear Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, the moment he approached me (as I &s;tood up to re|ceive him) I &s;alute you undoubtedly mine&mdash;And he &s;aluted me with ardor&mdash;I knew not which way to look&mdash;So <HI>polite</HI> a Lover as I thought him!&mdash;Yet never man was &s;o gracefully free!&mdash;It remains now,
<PB N="195" REF="196">
madam, proceeded he, &s;till holding my hand, to put to trial your goodne&s;s to me [You have done that al|ready, thought I!] in the greater que&s;tion, by which I am to conduct my&s;elf for the next week, or ten days.</P>
<P><HI>Week</HI> or <HI>ten days,</HI> thought I! Surely, Sir, you are an incroacher.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, &s;aid I, when a little recovered, what judges who, on &s;uch points as the&s;e, cannot err, have determined.</P>
<P>Yes, they <HI>can,</HI> interrupted he: As <HI>Ladies,</HI> they are parties&mdash;But I &s;ubmit. Their judgment mu&s;t be a law to me&mdash;I will go up to town, as they advi&s;e. I cannot, however, be long ab&s;ent from you. When I return, I will not put up at a public place. Either your uncle, or your grandmother, mu&s;t allow me to be their gue&s;t. This will oblige you, I hope, even for <HI>dear</HI> punctilio &s;ake, to honour me with your hand very &s;oon after my return.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed: I was &s;ilent. His fir&s;t addre&s;s had put me out. Remember, madam, I &s;aid, re&s;umed he, that I cannot be long ab&s;ent: You are above being governed by mere punctilio. Add to the obligations your gene|rous acceptance of me has laid me under&mdash;Why &s;ighs my Angel? [It was, my dear Lady G. an involuntary &s;igh!]&mdash;For the world, I would not give you either &s;en&s;ible or la&s;ting pain. But if the &s;ame circum&s;tances would make your nomination of a day as painful to you, &s;ome time hence, as now, then ble&s;s me with as early a day as you CAN give me, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the words of my judges.</P>
<P>This, Sir, &s;aid I (but I he&s;itated, and looked down) is one of the &s;olemn points which precede one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn circum&s;tances of my life. You &s;eem more in earne&s;t for an early day than I could have ex|pected. When I have declared that affectation has no part in the more di&s;tant compliance, I may be allowed, by the nice&s;t of my own Sex, to lay open to a man &s;o generous, tho' &s;o precipitating, my whole heart. In|deed,
<PB N="196" REF="197">
Sir, it is wholly yours&mdash;I blu&s;hed, as I felt, and turned away my face. It <HI>was</HI> a free declaration: But I was re&s;olved to bani&s;h affectation. He bowed profoundly on my hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it. Gratitude looked out in his eyes, and appeared in his graceful manner, tho' attentively &s;ilent.</P>
<P>You was my deliverer, proceeded I. An e&s;teem founded on gratitude, the object &s;o meritorious, ought to &s;et me above mere forms&mdash;Our judges &s;ay that you have the advantage in the argument.</P>
<P>I will lay no &s;tre&s;s, madam, on this part of their judgment in my favour&mdash;To your goodne&s;s, and to that &s;o nobly-acknowleged e&s;teem, I wholly refer my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf think, proceeded I, that you have the ad|vantage in the argument&mdash;All that is in my power, I would wi&s;h to do, to oblige you&mdash;</P>
<P>Conde&s;cending goodne&s;s!&mdash;Again he bowed on my hand.</P>
<P>Do you think, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Why he&s;itates my Love?</P>
<P>Do you think, &s;ix weeks&mdash;</P>
<P>Six ages, my deare&s;t, deare&s;t creature?&mdash;Six weeks! For Heaven's &s;ake, madam&mdash;He looked, he &s;poke, impatience.</P>
<P>What can a woman, who has owned your title to <HI>expect</HI> to be obliged, &s;ay?&mdash;let me, at lea&s;t, a&s;k (and I unaffectedly he&s;itated) a <HI>month,</HI> Sir&mdash;from this day&mdash;And that you will acknowlege your&s;elf not perver&s;ely or weakly treated.</P>
<P>He dropt on one knee, and ki&s;&s;ing my hand, once, twice, thrice, with rapture, <HI>Within</HI> the month! then I hope&mdash;I cannot live a month from you&mdash;Allow me to return in the fir&s;t fortnight of the month&mdash;</P>
<P>O Sir! and take up your re&s;idence with us, on your return.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, madam.&mdash;Con&s;ider, Sir&mdash;Do you al&s;o, deare&s;t madam, con&s;ider; and bani&s;h me not from you for &s;o very long a time.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="198">
My heart <HI>wanted,</HI> I thought, to oblige him; but to allow him to return &s;ooner, as he was to take up his abode with us, what was that, but, in effect, com|plying with his fir&s;t propo&s;al?</P>
<P>Permit me, Sir, to retire. Indeed you are too ur|gent.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked my excu&s;e; but declared, that he would not give up his humble plea <HI>(humble</HI> he <HI>called</HI> it) un|le&s;s my grandmamma and aunt told him, that he ought.</P>
<P>On his leaving me to return to company below, he pre&s;ented me with four little boxes. Accept, my be|loved Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, of the&s;e trifles. I received them not till this morning. While I had the Day to <HI>hope</HI> from you, my heart would not &s;uffer me to offer them, lea&s;t you &s;hould &s;u&s;pect me mean enough to imagine an influence from them. I oblige my&s;elf by the tender, and I comply with cu&s;tom, which I am fond of doing, whenever I can innocently do it. But I know, that you, my dear Mi&s;s Byron, value the heart more than a thou&s;and times the value of the&s;e&mdash;Mine, madam, is yours, and will be yours to the end of my life.</P>
<P>What could I &s;ay?&mdash;My heart, on recollection, re|proaches me for my ungraceful acceptance. I courte|&s;ied. I was &s;illy. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on only can be pre&s;ent to every occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>He <HI>looked</HI> as if my <HI>not</HI> refu&s;ing them was a favour more than equivalent to the value of the pre&s;ents. My deare&s;t life! &s;aid he, on my putting them on my toilette, how much you oblige me!&mdash;Shall I conduct you to our friends below? Will you acquaint your grandmamma and aunt with our debate, and my bold expectation?</P>
<P>I &s;tood &s;till. He took my hand, pre&s;&s;ed it with his lips, and, with a reverence more than u&s;ually pro|found, as if he had <HI>received</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>conferred</HI> a fa|vour, withdrew. Never was a pre&s;ent &s;o gracefully
<PB N="198" REF="199">
made! I cannot de&s;cribe the grace with which he made it.</P>
<P>My uncle, it &s;eems, as &s;oon as he went down, a&s;ked him, How we had &s;ettled the great affair? My grandmamma and aunt in a breath, as he paid his compliments to them, a&s;ked him, If their Harriet had been good?&mdash;or, as good as he expected?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, has taken more time than I could have wi&s;hed &s;he had. A month, &s;he talks of.</P>
<P>Has &s;he complied &s;o far? &s;aid my grandmamma. I am glad of it. I was afraid &s;he would have in&s;i&s;ted upon more time&mdash;So was I, &s;aid my aunt. But who can with&s;tand Sir Charles Grandi&s;on? Has the dear girl given you the very day, Sir?</P>
<P>No, madam. If &s;he had, I &s;hould have hoped it would have been con&s;iderably <HI>within</HI> the month. As yet, Ladies, I hope it will.</P>
<P>Nay, Sir Charles, if you are not plea&s;ed with a month, &s;aid my aunt&mdash;Hu&s;h, dear Ladies!&mdash;Here comes the Angel.&mdash;Not a word, I be&s;eech you, on that &s;ide of the que&s;tion&mdash;She will think, if you ap|plaud her, that &s;he has con&s;ented to too &s;hort a term&mdash;You mu&s;t not make her unea&s;y with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Does not this look as if he imagined there was <HI>room</HI> for me to be &s;o?&mdash;I <HI>almo&s;t</HI> wi&s;h&mdash;I do'nt know what I wi&s;h; except I could think but half &s;o well of my&s;elf as I do of him: For then &s;hould I look for|ward with le&s;s pain in my joy than now too often min|gles with it.</P>
<P>Your brother excu&s;ed him&s;elf from dining with us: That Greville has engaged him. Why would he per|mit him&s;elf to be engaged by him? Greville cannot love him: He can only admire him, and that every|body does, who has been but once in his company. Mi&s;s Orme, even Mi&s;s Orme, is in Love with him. I received a note from her while your brother was with us. The&s;e are the contents:</P>

<P>I Will hurry off a few lines. I am always ready before the&s;e fiddling girls: Lucy and Nancy, I mean. Never tedious, but in dre&s;&s;ing! They will over-do the morning appearance. I could beat them. So well acquainted with propriety as they are; and knowing the beauty of elegant negligence. Were I not afraid of Lucy's repartee; and that &s;he would &s;ay I was laying out for a compliment; I would tell them they had a mind to try to eclip&s;e Mi&s;s Clark&s;on, and the York&s;hire Ladies. Your brother <HI>&s;upped,</HI> as well as dined, at that Greville's. Fie upon him! I did not think he had &s;o little command of him&s;elf!&mdash;Vain Har|riet! Perhaps he <HI>cho&s;e</HI> to be rather <HI>there</HI> than <HI>here,</HI> for <HI>novelty</HI> -&s;ake. I &s;hall be &s;aucy, by-and-by.

They all were ready to wor&s;hip him. Fenwick looked in ju&s;t now, and tells us &s;o. He &s;ays, that your brother was the livelie&s;t man in the company. He led the mirth, he &s;ays, and vi&s;ibly exerted him&s;elf the more, finding the turn of the conver&s;ation likely to be what might be expected from &s;uch a company of all men. Wretches! Can twenty of them, when met, be to|lerable creatures, not a woman among them, to &s;often their manners, and give politene&s;s to their conver&s;a|tion?&mdash;Fenwick &s;ays, they engaged him at one time into talk of different regions, cu&s;toms, u&s;ages.

Fenwick has humour; a little: Not much; only by accident. So unlike <HI>him&s;elf</HI> at times, that he may pa&s;s for a dif|ferent man. His aping Greville, helps his oddne&s;s.&mdash;How I ramble!

<P>JUST come back from Mi&s;s Orme's. Sir Charles and my grandmamma are now got together, in &s;erious
<PB N="203" REF="204">
talk. I know I was the &s;ubject, by the dear parent's looking often &s;miling upon me, as I &s;at at di&s;tance, and by his eyes (taking the reference, as I may call it, of her's) turned as often towards me; &s;o I &s;tole up to my pen.</P>
<P>We were very politely treated by Mi&s;s Orme. Mi&s;s Clark&s;on is a charming young Lady: The three York|&s;hire &s;i&s;ters are lovely women. Sir Charles has told us, that mere Beauty attracts only his eyes, as fine flowers do in a gay parterre. I don't know <HI>that,</HI> my dear: That's the <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> de&s;cription of him&s;elf. The <HI>&s;ame</HI> men and women are not always the <HI>&s;ame</HI> per&s;ons. The Ladies, one and all, when his back was turned, declared, that he was the gallante&s;t man they ever were in company with. He &s;aid the ea&s;ie&s;t, polite&s;t things, they ever heard &s;poken.&mdash;They never were in his company <HI>before:</HI> They might el&s;e have heard <HI>as</HI> fine. Such dignity they ob&s;erved (&s;o does every-body), yet &s;o much ea&s;e, in all he &s;aid, as well as in his whole behaviour&mdash;<HI>Born</HI> to be a public man, would his pride permit him to aim at being &s;o!&mdash;Not a &s;yllable, however, but what might be &s;aid to each with the &s;tricte&s;t truth. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on [It is Lucy's ob&s;ervation, as well as mine] addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to women, <HI>as</HI> women, not as godde&s;&s;es; yet does honour to the per&s;ons, and to the &s;ex. Other men, not knowing what better to &s;ay, make Angels of them, all at once. The highe&s;t things are ever &s;aid by men of the lowe&s;t under&s;tandings; and, their bolts once &s;hot, the poor &s;ouls can go no further. So &s;illy!&mdash;Has not your Lady&s;hip &s;ome of the&s;e in your eye, who make out the re&s;t, by grinning in our faces, in order to convince us of their <HI>&s;incerity?</HI> Compli|mental men don't con&s;ider, that if the women they egregiou&s;ly flatter were what they would have them be|lieve they think them, they would not be &s;een in &s;uch company.</P>
<P>But what do you think the elder &s;i&s;ter of the three
<PB N="204" REF="205">
&s;aid of your brother?&mdash;She was &s;ure, tho&s;e eyes, and that vivacity and politene&s;s, were not given him for nothing. <HI>Given him for nothing!</HI> What a phra&s;e is that! In &s;hort, &s;he &s;aid, that <HI>practice</HI> had improved his natural advantages. <HI>This</HI> I have a good mind to &s;ay of <HI>her</HI>&mdash;Either &s;he had not charity, or her heart has paid for enabling its mi&s;tre&s;s to make &s;uch an ob|&s;ervation. <HI>Practice!</HI> What meant &s;he by the word?&mdash;Indeed your brother was not quite &s;o <HI>ab&s;tractedly</HI> in|attentive, <HI>I</HI> thought, to the Beauty of Mi&s;s Clark&s;on, but he might give &s;ome <HI>little &s;hadow</HI> of ground for ob|&s;ervation to a cen&s;orious per&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;ometimes think, that, free and open as his eyes are, his character might &s;uffer, if one were to judge of his heart by them. Lord L. I remember, once &s;aid, that Ladies abroad u&s;ed to look upon him as their own man, the moment they beheld him.&mdash;In|nocently &s;o, no doubt, and in their conver&s;ation-a&s;&s;emblies. Poor Lady Olivia, I &s;uppo&s;e, was &s;o caught! at an unhappy moment, perhaps when her caution was half-a&s;leep, and &s;he was loth to have it too rudely awakened. But ought I, your Harriet, to talk of this?&mdash;Where was <HI>my</HI> caution, when I &s;uf|fered <HI>my&s;elf</HI> to be &s;urpri&s;ed?&mdash;O but my <HI>gratitude</HI> was my excu&s;e. Who knows what Olivia might have to plead?&mdash;We have not her whole &s;tory, you know. Poor Lady! I pity her! To cro&s;s the &s;eas, as &s;he did!&mdash;Ineffectually!</P>
<P>But can you bear this pen-prattling; the effects of a mind more at ea&s;e than it ever expected to be?</P>
<P>I will go down. <HI>Can</HI> I be &s;o long &s;pared? I am ju&s;t thinking, that were I one of the creatures called Coquettes, the be&s;t way to attract attention, when it grew languid, is, to do as I do from zeal in writing to you&mdash;Be always going out and returning, and not &s;taying long enough in a place to tire one's company, or &s;uffer them to turn their eyes upon any-body el&s;e. Did <HI>you</HI> ever try &s;uch an experiment, Charlotte? But
<PB N="205" REF="206">
you never <HI>could</HI> tire your company. Yet I think you have a &s;pice of that character in yours. Don't you think &s;o, your&s;elf?&mdash;But don't own it, if you do&mdash;Hey-day! What's the matter with me! I believe by my flippancy I am growing quite well, and as &s;aucy as I u&s;ed to be&mdash;Poor Lady Clementina! I wi&s;h &s;he were happy! Then &s;hould I be &s;o.</P>
<P>MY dear Lady G. we had a charming conver&s;ation this day: My grandmamma and your brother bore the principal parts in it. It began with dre&s;s, and fa&s;hion, and &s;uch-like trifling &s;ubjects; but ended in the noble&s;t. You know my grandmamma's chearful piety. Sir Charles &s;eemed at fir&s;t only de&s;igning to attend to her wi&s;dom; but &s;he drew him in. O my dear! he &s;eems to be, yet not to know it, as good a man, as &s;he is a woman! Yet years &s;o different!&mdash;But au&s;terity, uncharitablene&s;s, on one hand; o&s;ten|tation, affectation, on the other; the&s;e are qualities which can have no place in his heart. Such a glo|rious benevolence! Such enlarged &s;entiments!&mdash;What a happy, thrice happy woman, thought I, &s;everal times, mu&s;t &s;he be, who &s;hall be con&s;idered as a par|taker of his goodne&s;s! Who &s;hall be ble&s;t not only <HI>in</HI> him, but <HI>for</HI> him; and be his, and he hers, to all eternity!</P>
<P>My aunt once, in the conclu&s;ion of this conver&s;a|tion, &s;aid, How happy would it be, if he could reform certain gentlemen of this neighbourhood! And as they were &s;o fond of his company, &s;he hoped he would attempt it.</P>
<P>Example, he an&s;wered, and a <HI>&s;ilent</HI> one, would do more with &s;uch men than <HI>precept. They have Mo&s;es, and the prophets.</HI> They know when they do wrong, and what is right. They would be afraid of, and affronted at, a man pretending to in&s;truct them. De|cency, from &s;uch men, is as much as can be expected. We live in &s;uch an age, added he, that I believe more
<PB N="206" REF="207">
good may be done by &s;eeming to relax a little, than by &s;trictne&s;s of behaviour. Yet I admire tho&s;e, who, from a full per&s;ua&s;ion of their duty, do <HI>not</HI> relax; and the more, if they have got above moro&s;ene&s;s, au|&s;terity, and uncharitablene&s;s.</P>
<P>After dinner, Mr. Milbourne, a very good man, mini&s;ter of a Di&s;&s;enting congregation in our neigh|bourhood, accompanied by Dr. Curtis, called in upon us. They are good friends; made &s;o by the media|tion of my grandmamma, &s;ome years ago, when they did <HI>not</HI> &s;o well under&s;tand each other. Dr. Curtis had been with us more than once, &s;ince Sir Charles was our vi&s;iter. He greatly admires him, you need not doubt. It was beautiful, after compliments had pa&s;&s;ed between Sir Charles and the gentlemen, to &s;ee the <HI>mode&s;t man</HI> &s;hine out in your brother's behaviour. In|deed he was free and ea&s;y, but attentive, as expecting entertainment and in&s;truction from <HI>them;</HI> and leading <HI>each</HI> of them to give it in his own way.</P>
<P>They &s;taid but a little while; and when they were gone, Sir Charles &s;aid, He wanted no other proof of their being good men, than they gave by their cha|rity, and friend&s;hip to each other. My uncle, who, you know, is a zealous man <HI>for the Church,</HI> &s;peaking a little &s;everely of per&s;ons whom he called <HI>Sci&s;matics;</HI> O Mr. Selby! &s;aid Sir Charles, let us be afraid of pre&s;cribing to tender con&s;ciences. You and I, who have been abroad, in countries where they account us <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than Schi&s;matics, would have been loath to have been pre&s;cribed to, or compelled, in articles for which we our&s;elves are only an&s;werable to the common Fa|ther of us all&punc;</P>
<P>I believe in my con&s;cience, Sir Charles, replied my uncle, if the truth were known, you are of the mind of that King of Egypt, who &s;aid, He looked upon the diver&s;ity of religions in his kingdom with as much plea&s;ure as he did on the diver&s;ity of flowers in his garden.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">
I remember not the name of that King of Egypt, Mr. Selby; but I am <HI>not</HI> of his mind. I &s;hould not, if I were a king, take <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> in &s;uch a diver&s;ity: But as the <HI>examples</HI> of Kings are of great force, I would, by making my own as faultle&s;s as I could, let my people &s;ee the excellence of my per&s;ua&s;ion, and my uniform practical adherence to it; in&s;tead of di&s;|couraging erroneous ones by unju&s;tifiable &s;everity. Religious zeal is generally a fiery thing: I would as &s;oon quarrel with a man for his Face, as for his Reli|gion. A good man, if not over-hated by zeal, <HI>will be</HI> a good man, whatever be his faith; and &s;hould al|ways be intitled to our e&s;teem, as he is to our good offices as a fellow-creature.</P>
<P>The <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> Sir Charles; What think you of the <HI>Methodi&s;ts!</HI> Say you love 'em; and, and, and, adds-dines, you &s;hall not be my nephew.</P>
<P>You, now, my dear Mr. Selby, make me afraid of you. You throw out a menace, the <HI>only</HI> one you could perhaps think of, that would make me temporize.</P>
<P>You need not, you need not, be afraid, Sir Charles, &s;aid my uncle, laughing! What &s;ay <HI>you,</HI> Harriet? <HI>Need</HI> he? Hay? looking in my downca&s;t face. Why &s;peak you not, <HI>lovely Love?</HI> Need Sir Charles, if he <HI>had</HI> di&s;obliged <HI>me,</HI> to have been <HI>afraid?</HI>&mdash;Hay?</P>
<P>Dear Sir! you have not of a long time been &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P>So, <HI>what,</HI> Harriet? So, <HI>what,</HI> deare&s;t? looking me quite down.</P>
<P>Fie, Mr. Selby! &s;aid my grandmamma. Sir Charles, &s;tepping to me, very gallantly took my hand&mdash;O Mr. Selby, you are not kind, &s;aid he: But allow me to make my advantage of your unkindne&s;s. My dear Mi&s;s Byron, let you and I withdraw; in com|pa&s;&s;ion to Mr. Selby, let us withdraw: We will not hear him chidden, as I &s;ee the Ladies think he ought to be.</P>
<P>And he hurried me off. The &s;urprize made me appear more reluctant than I was in my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="209">
Every one was plea&s;ed with his air and manner; and by this means he relieved him&s;elf from &s;ubjects with which he &s;eemed not delighted, and obtained an opportunity to get me to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Here</HI> had he &s;topt, he would have been welcome: But hurrying me into the Cedar-parlour; I am jea|lous, my Love, &s;aid he; putting his arm round me: You &s;eemed loth to retire with me. Forgive me: But thus I puni&s;h you, whenever you give me cau&s;e: And, dear Lady G. he downright ki&s;&s;ed me&mdash;My lip; and not my cheek&mdash;and in &s;o fervent a way&mdash;I tell you every-thing, my Charlotte&mdash;I could have been angry&mdash;had I known <HI>how,</HI> from &s;urprize. Before I could recollect my&s;elf, he withdrew his arm; and, re|&s;uming his u&s;ual re&s;pectful air, it would have made me look affected, had I then taken notice of it. But I don't remember any in&s;tance of the like freedom u&s;ed to Lady Clementina.</P>
<P>My <HI>lovely Love,</HI> &s;aid he, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in your uncle's &s;tile, which is that of my heart, tell me, Can you have pity for a poor man, when he is mi&s;erable, who, on a certain occa&s;ion, &s;hewed <HI>you</HI> none? See what a Letter Sir Hargrave Pollexfen has written to Dr. Bartlett; who a&s;ks my advice about attending him.</P>
<P>I obtained leave to communicate it to you, my dear Ladies. Be plea&s;ed to return it to me. I pre&s;ume, you will read it here.</P>

All is gloom and horror in my mind: My de&s;pondency is, mu&s;t be, of the blacke&s;t kind. It is blacker than remor&s;e: It is all repining; but no repentance: I cannot, cannot, repent. Lord God of Heaven and Earth, what a

wretch am I! with &s;uch a fortune; &s;uch e&s;tates! I am rich as Crae&s;us, yet more mi&s;erable than the wretch that begs his bread from door to door; and who oftener meets repul&s;es, than relief. What a glorious choice has your patron made! Youth unbroken; con|&s;cience his friend; he cannot know an enemy. O that I had lived the life of your patron! I cannot &s;ee a creature who does not extol him. My wine-mer|chant's name is Danby&mdash;Good God! What &s;tories does he tell of him! Lord Je&s;us! What a heart mu&s;t he have, that would permit him to do &s;uch things as Danby reports of him, of his own knowlege! While I&mdash;As young a man as him&s;elf, for what I know&mdash;With power to do good, as great, perhaps greater, than his own.&mdash;Lord! Lord! Lord! what a hand have I made of it, for the la&s;t three or four years of my life! who might have reached Three&s;core-and-ten with comfort! whereas now, at Twenty-eight, I am on the very brink of the grave. It appears to me as ready dug: It yawns for me: I am neither fit to die, nor to live. My days are dreadful: My nights are wor&s;e: My bed is a bed of nettles, and not of down. Not one comfortable thought, not one good action, to revolve, in which I had not &s;ome vile gratification to promote! Wretched man! It is come home to me, with a vengeance.</P>
<P>You prayed by me: You prayed for me. I have not been &s;o happy &s;ince&mdash;Come, and make me ea&s;y&mdash;happy I can never be, in this world&mdash;For pity, for charity &s;ake, come and teach me how to bear life, or how to prepare for its ce&s;&s;ation. And if Sir Charles Grandi&s;on would make me one more vi&s;it, would per|&s;onally join in prayer with you and me, a glimp&s;e of comfort would once more dart in upon my mind.</P>
<P>Try your intere&s;t with him, my dear Sir, in my behalf; and come together. Where is he?&mdash;The great God of Heaven and Earth pro&s;per to him all his wi&s;hes, be he where he will, and be they what they

Narrow-&s;oul'd Jordan! He is reformed; but not able to divide the <HI>man</HI> from the <HI>crime,</HI> he thinks he cannot be in earne&s;t, but by hating both. God help me! I cannot, now, if I would, give him a bad example! He need not be afraid of my &s;taggering him in his good purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>One favour, for God's &s;ake, procure for me&mdash;It s, that the man who&s;e life once I &s;ought, and thought my&s;elf ju&s;tified by the provocation; who afterwards &s;aved mine, for a <HI>time</HI> &s;aved it, re&s;erved as I was for pains, for &s;ufferings, in mind and body, wor&s;e than death&mdash;That <HI>this</HI> man will be the Executor of my la&s;t Will. I have not a friend left. My relations are hungering and watching for my death, as birds of prey over a field of battle. My next heirs are my wor&s;t enemies, and mo&s;t hated by me. Dear Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, my deliverer, my pre&s;erver, from tho&s;e bloody Frenchmen, if you are the good man I think you, complete your kindne&s;s to him whom you have pre|&s;erved; and &s;ay, you will be his Executor. I <HI>will</HI> (becau&s;e I <HI>mu&s;t)</HI> do ju&s;tice to the preten&s;ions of tho&s;e who will rejoice over my remains; and I will leave you a di&s;cretionary power, in articles wherein you may think I have &s;hewn hatred. For ju&s;tice-&s;ake, then, be my Executor. And do you, good Bartlett, put me in the way of repentance; and I &s;hall then be happy. Draw me up, dear Sir, a Prayer, that &s;hall include Confu&s;ion. You cannot &s;uppo&s;e me too bad a man, in a Chri&s;tian &s;en&s;e. Thank God, I am a Chri&s;tian in belief, tho' I have been a Devil in prac|tice. You are a heavenly-minded man; give me words which may go to my heart; and tell me what I &s;hall &s;ay to my God.</P>
<P>Tell Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, that he <HI>owes</HI> to me the &s;ervice I reque&s;t of him. For if he had not inter|po&s;ed

<P>Your brother's eye followed mine, as I read. I fre|quently wept. In a &s;oothing, tender, and re&s;pectful manner, he put his arm round me, and, taking my own handkerchief, unre&s;i&s;ted, wiped away the tears as they fell on my cheek. The&s;e were his &s;oothing words as my bo&s;om heaved at the dreadful de&s;cription of the poor man's mi&s;ery and de&s;pair: Sweet humanity!&mdash;Charming &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;Check not the kindly gu&s;h!&mdash;Dew-drops of Heaven! wiping away my tears, and ki&s;&s;ing the handkerchief&mdash;Dew-drops of Heaven, from a mind, like that Heaven, mild and gracious!&mdash;Poor Sir Hargrave!&mdash;I will attend him.</P>
<P>You <HI>will,</HI> Sir! That is very good of you!&mdash;Poor man! What a hand, as he &s;ays, has he made of it!</P>
<P>A hand, indeed! repeated Sir Charles, his own be|nign eyes gli&s;tening.</P>
<P>And will you be his Executor, Sir?&mdash;You will, I hope?</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="213">
I will do any-thing that my dear Mi&s;s Byron wi&s;hes me to do; any-thing that may comfort the poor man, if indeed he has not a per&s;on in whom he <HI>ought</HI> to confide, whether he is <HI>willing</HI> to do &s;o, or not. My endeavour &s;hall be, to reconcile him to his relations: Perhaps he hates them becau&s;e they are likely to be his heirs: I have known men capable of &s;uch narrow|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>When we came to the place where the unhappy man mentions my having been likely to be his in two hours time, a chilne&s;s came over my heart; I &s;hud|dered. Ah, Sir! &s;aid I, how grateful ought I to be to <HI>my</HI> deliverer!</P>
<P>Ever-amiable goodne&s;s! re&s;umed he, How have I been, how am I, how &s;hall I be, rewarded?&mdash;With tender awe he ki&s;&s;ed my cheek&mdash;Forgive me, Angel of a woman!

<P>Your tender remembrance of Lady Clementina, Sir, will ever be grateful to me.&mdash;God Almighty make her happy!&mdash;for your &s;ake! for the &s;ake of your dear Jeronymo; and for mine!</P>

<P>But, Sir!&mdash;<HI>Mu&s;t</HI> Clementina be <HI>compelled</HI> to marry? <HI>Mu&s;t</HI> the woman who has loved Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on; who &s;tills avows her Love, and only prefers her God to him; be <HI>obliged</HI> to give her hand to another man?</P>

My &s;ituation has not been happy. Nothing but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own integrity (excu&s;e, madam, the &s;eeming boa&s;t) and a firm tru&s;t in Providence, could, at certain times, have &s;upported me.</P>

Poor Greville had a view, by inviting all his neighbours and me, to let him&s;elf down with a grace, in a certain ca&s;e.

Something ari&s;es in my heart, that makes me unea&s;y: I cannot account to my&s;elf for this great and &s;udden change of behaviour in Greville. His extra|ordinary civilities, even to fondne&s;s, to your brother! Are they con&s;i&s;tent with his blu&s;tring character, and con&s;tant threatnings of any man who was likely to &s;ucceed with me? A turn of behaviour &s;o &s;udden!

<P>THE apprehen&s;ions with which I was &s;o weak as to trouble you, in the conclu&s;ion of my la&s;t, laid &s;o fa&s;t hold of my mind, that, going immedi|ately from my pen to my re&s;t, I had it broken and di&s;turbed by dreadful, &s;hocking, wandering dreams. The terror they gave me, &s;everal times awakened me; but &s;till, as I clo&s;ed my eyes, I fell into them again. Whence, my dear, proceed the&s;e ideal vagaries, which, for the time, realize pain or plea&s;ure to us, according to their hue or complexion, or rather according to our own?</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="218">
But &s;uch <HI>contradictory</HI> vagaries never did I know in my &s;lumbers. Incoherences of incoherence!&mdash;For example&mdash;I was married to the be&s;t of men: I was <HI>not</HI> married: I was rejected with &s;corn, as a pre&s;ump|tuous creature. I &s;ought to hide my&s;elf in holes and corners. I was dragged out of a &s;ubterraneous cavern, which the &s;ea had made when it once broke bounds, and &s;eemed the dwelling of howling and conflicting winds; and when I expected to be puni&s;hed for my audaciou&s;ne&s;s, and for repining at my lot, I was turned into an Angel of light; &s;tars of diamonds, like a glory, encompa&s;&s;ing my head: A dear little baby was put into my arms. Once it was Lucy's; another time it was Emily's; and at another time Lady Clementina's!&mdash;I was fond of it, beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I again dreamed I was married: Sir Charles again was the man. He did not love me. My grand|mamma and aunt, on their knees, and with tears, be&s;ought him to love their child; and pleaded to him my love of him of long &s;tanding, begun in grati|tude; and that he was the only man I ever loved. O how I wept in my dream! My face and bo&s;om were wet with my real tears.</P>
<P>My &s;obs, and my di&s;tre&s;s and <HI>theirs,</HI> awakenod me; but I dropt a&s;leep, and fell into the very &s;ame re&s;verie. He upbraided me with being the cau&s;e that he had not Lady Clementina. He &s;aid, and <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;ternly! I am &s;ure he cannot look &s;o &s;ternly, that he thought me a much better creature than I proved to be: Yet methought, in my own heart, I was not altered. I fell down at his feet. I called it my misfortune, that he could not love me: I would not &s;ay it was his fault. It might, perhaps, be his misfortune too!&mdash;And then I &s;aid, Love and Hatred are not always in one's power. If you cannot love the poor creature who kneels be|fore you, <HI>that</HI> &s;hall be a cau&s;e &s;ufficient with me for a divorce: I de&s;ire not to fa&s;ten my&s;elf on the man who cannot love me. Let me be divorced from you, Sir&mdash;
<PB N="218" REF="219">
You &s;hall be at liberty to a&s;&s;ign any cau&s;e for the &s;epa|ration but <HI>crime.</HI> I will bind my&s;elf never, never to marry again; but you &s;hall be free&mdash;And God ble&s;s you, and her you can love better than your poor Har|riet.&mdash;Fool! I weep as I write!&mdash;What a weak crea|ture, I am, &s;ince I have not been well!</P>
<P>In another part of my re&s;verie he loved me dearly; but when he nearly approached me, or I him, he al|ways became a gho&s;t, and flitted from me. Scenes once changed from England to Italy, from Italy to England: Italy, I thought, was a dreary wild, covered with &s;now, and pinched with fro&s;t: England, on the contrary, was a country glorious to the eye; gilded with a &s;un not too fervid; the air perfumed with odours, wafted by the mo&s;t balmy Zephyrs from orange-trees, citrons, myrtles and je&s;&s;amines. In Italy, at one time, Jeronymo's wounds were healed; at an|other, they were breaking out afre&s;h. Mr. Lowther was obliged to fly the country: Why, did not appear. There was a fourth brother, I thought; and he, taking part with the cruel Laurana, was killed by the Ge|neral. Father Mare&s;cotti was at one time a martyr for his Religion; at another, a Cardinal; and talked of for Pope.</P>
<P>But &s;till, what was more &s;hocking, and which &s;o terrified me that I awoke in a horror which put an end to all my re&s;veries (for I &s;lept no more that night)&mdash;Sir Charles, I thought was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by Greville. Greville fled his country for it, and became a vaga|bond, a Cain, the Accur&s;ed, I thought, of God and Man&mdash;I, your poor Harriet, a widow; left in the mo&s;t calamitous circum&s;tance that a woman can be in&mdash;Good Heaven!&mdash;But, avaunt, recollection!&mdash;Painful, <HI>mo&s;t</HI> painful recollection of ideas &s;o terrible! none of your intru&s;ions&mdash;</P>
<P>No more of the&s;e horrid, horrid incongruities, will I trouble you with! How have they run away with me! I am hardly now recovered from the tremblings into which they threw me!</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220">
What, my dear, is the rea&s;on, that tho' we know the&s;e dreams, the&s;e fleeting &s;hadows of the night, to be no more than <HI>dreams,</HI> illu&s;ions of the working mind, fettered and deba&s;ed as it is by the organs through which it conveys its confined powers to the gro&s;&s;er matter, body, then &s;leeping, inactive, as in the &s;hades of death; yet that we cannot help being &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed by them, and meditating interpretation of the flying vapours, when rea&s;on is broad awake, and tells us, that it is weakne&s;s to be di&s;turbed at them?&mdash;But Super&s;tition is, more or le&s;s, I believe, in every mind, a natural defect. Happily poi&s;ed is that mind, which, on the one hand, is too &s;trong to be affected by the &s;lavi&s;h fears it brings with it; and, on the other, runs not into the contrary extreme, Sceptici&s;m, the parent of infidelity!</P>
<P>You cannot imagine, my dear, the plea&s;ure I had, the more for my various dream, when your brother, &s;o amiably &s;erene, Love, Conde&s;cen&s;ion, Affability, &s;hining in his manly countenance, alighted, as I &s;aw him through my window, at the &s;ame time I had the call to breakfa&s;t&mdash;Dear Sir! I could have &s;aid, Have not you been di&s;turbed by cruel, perplexing, contra|dictory vi&s;ions! Souls may be near, when Bodies are di|&s;tant. But are we not one Soul? Could yours be unaf|fected, when mine was &s;o much di&s;turbed?&mdash;But, thank God, you are come? Come &s;afe, unhurt, plea&s;ed with me! My fond arms, were the ceremony pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hould welcome you to your Harriet. I would tell you all my di&s;turbances from the ab&s;urd illu&s;ions of the pa&s;t night, and my mind &s;hould gather &s;trength from the confe&s;&s;ion of its weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>He talked of &s;etting out early to-morrow morning. His fir&s;t vi&s;it, he &s;aid, &s;hould be to Sir Harry Beau|champ; his next to Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. Poor Sir Harry! he &s;aid, and &s;ighed for him.</P>
<P>Tender-hearted man! as Clementina often called your brother! he pitied Lady Beauchamp. His poor
<PB N="220" REF="221">
Beauchamp!&mdash;The lo&s;s of a father, he &s;aid, where a great e&s;tate was to de&s;cend to the &s;on, was the te&s;t of a noble heart. He could an&s;wer for the &s;incerity of his Beauchamp's grief, on this trying occa&s;ion. Of what joy, &s;aid he [&s;itting between two of the be&s;t of women, equally fond of him, &s;peaking low] was I, was <HI>my</HI> father, deprived! He had allowed me to think of returning to the arms of his paternal love. I make no doubt, but on looking into his affairs (his &s;on, per|haps his &s;teward) he would have done for his daughters, what I have done for my &s;i&s;ters. We &s;hould both of us have had a new life to begin, and pur&s;ue: A happy one, from my duty and his indulgence, it mu&s;t have been. I had planned it out.&mdash;With all humility I would, by degrees, have laid it before him, fir&s;t one part, then another, as his conde&s;cen&s;ion would have countenanced me.</P>
<P>Vile, vile re&s;veries!&mdash;Mu&s;t not this young man be the peculiar care of Heaven? How could my di&s;turbed imagination terrify me but in a dream, that the ma|chinations of the darke&s;t mind (as his mu&s;t be [Gre|ville is not &s;o bad a man] who could meditate violence again&s;t virtue &s;o &s;acredly guarded) could be permitted to prevail again&s;t his life!</P>
<P>My grandmamma once, with tears in her eyes, as he talked of taking leave, laid her hand upon his, and in&s;tantly withdrew it, as if &s;he thought the action too free. He took her hand, and, with both his, lifted it to his lips&mdash;Venerable goodne&s;s! he called her. She looked <HI>&s;o</HI> proud, and <HI>&s;o</HI> comforted! every one <HI>&s;o</HI> plea&s;ed!&mdash;It is a charming thing to &s;ee blooming youth fond of declining age!</P>
<P>They dropt away one by one, and I found my&s;elf left alone with him. Sweetly tender was his addre&s;s to me! How &s;hall I part with my Harriet? &s;aid he. My eyes were ready to overflow. By a twinkling motion, I thought to di&s;per&s;e over the whole eye the &s;elf-felt too ready tear: My upper-lip had the mo|tion
<PB N="221" REF="222">
in it, throbbing, like the pul&s;ation which we call the life-blood&mdash;I was afraid to &s;peak, for fear of bur&s;t|ing into a fit of tenderne&s;s; yet was con&s;cious that my very &s;ilence was more expre&s;&s;ive of tenderne&s;s than &s;peech could have been. With what delight did his eager eye (as mine, now-and-then glancing upward, di&s;covered) meditate my downca&s;t face, and &s;ilent con|cern! Yet &s;uch was his delicacy, that he took not that notice of it, in words, which, if he had, would have added to my confu&s;ion: It was enough for him, that he &s;aw it. As he was contented <HI>&s;ilently</HI> to enjoy the apparent affection, I am not &s;orry he <HI>did</HI> &s;ee it. He merited even open and unre&s;erved a&s;&s;urances of Love. But I the &s;ooner recovered my &s;pirits, for his delicate non-ob&s;ervance. I could not, circum&s;tanced as we were, &s;ay I <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> for his &s;peedy return; yet, my dear, my pure&s;t wi&s;hes were, that he would not be long ab&s;ent. My grandmamma plea&s;es her&s;elf with having the dear man for her inmate, on his return: There is therefore no need, for the &s;ake of the world's &s;peech, to abridge my month; yet <HI>ought</HI> we to be &s;hy of giving con&s;equence to a man who through delicacy is afraid to let us &s;ee that he a&s;&s;umes con&s;equence from our &s;peechle&s;s tenderne&s;s for him?&mdash;He re&s;tored me to &s;peech, by a change of &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
<P>Two melancholy offices &s;hall I have to perform, &s;aid he, before I have the honour to attend again my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron: What mu&s;t be the heart that melts not at another's woe!&mdash;As to Sir Hargrave, I don't apprehend that he is near his end; as is the ca&s;e of poor Sir Harry. Sir Hargrave labours under bo|dily pains, from the attack made upon him in France, and from a con&s;titution ruined perhaps by riot: And, having nothing of con&s;olation to give him&s;elf from re|flexion on his pa&s;t life, as we &s;ee by his Letter, his fears are too &s;trong for his hopes. But &s;hall I tell him, if I find it will give him comfort, that <HI>you</HI> wi&s;h his recovery, and are &s;orry for his indi&s;po&s;ition? Small
<PB N="222" REF="223">
crevices let in light, &s;ometimes upon a benighted ima|gination. He mu&s;t con&s;ider his attempt upon your free-will (tho' not meant upon your honour) as one of the enormities of his pa&s;t life.</P>
<P>I was overpowered with this in&s;tance of his ge|nerous goodne&s;s Teach me, Sir, to be good, to be generous, to be forgiving&mdash;like you!&mdash;Bid me do what you think proper for me to do&mdash;Say to the poor man, who&s;e in&s;ults upon you in his challenge were then my terror (O how much my terror!) in my name &s;ay, all that you think will tend to give him con|&s;olation.</P>
<P>Sweet excellence! Did I ever hope to meet in wo|man with &s;uch an enlargement of heart!&mdash;Clemen|tina only, of all the women I ever knew, can be &s;et in compari&s;on with you: And <HI>had</HI> &s;he been granted to me, the union of minds between us from difference of Religion, could not have been &s;o perfect, as yours and mine mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>Greatly gratified as I was by the compliment, I was &s;orry, methought, that it was made me at the expence of my Sex. His words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Did I ever hope to meet in woman with &s;uch an enlargement of heart!'</Q> piqued me a little. Are not women as capable as men, thought I, of enlarged &s;entiments?</P>
<P>The leave he took of me was extremely tender. I endeavoured to check my &s;en&s;ibility. He departed with the ble&s;&s;ings of the whole family, as well as mine. I was forced to go up to my clo&s;et: I came not down till near dinner-time; I <HI>could</HI> not; and yet my uncle accompanied my cou&s;in James to North|hampton: So that I had no apprehen&s;ions of his rail|lery. One <HI>wants</HI> trials &s;ometimes, I believe, to make one &s;upport one's &s;elf with &s;ome degree of <HI>outward</HI> fortitude, at lea&s;t. Had my uncle been at home, I &s;hould not have dared to have given &s;o much way to my concern: But &s;oothing and indulgence, &s;ometimes, I believe, add to our imbecility of mind, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening our rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">
MY uncle made it near eleven at night before he returned, with my cou&s;in James. Not one of the company, at his quitting it, &s;eemed inclinable to move. He prai&s;ed the elegance of the entertainment, and the ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s, even to vivacity, of Sir Charles. How <HI>could</HI> he be &s;o lively!&mdash;How many ways have men to divert them&s;elves, when any-thing arduous attacks them!&mdash;While we poor women!&mdash;But your town-diver&s;ions&mdash;Your Ranelaghs, Vaux-halls&mdash;bid fair to divert &s;uch of us as can carry our&s;elves out of our&s;elves!&mdash;Yet are we likely to pay dear for the privi|lege; &s;ince we thereby render our Sex cheap in the eyes of men, harden our fronts, and are in danger of lo&s;ing that mode&s;ty, at lea&s;t of <HI>outward</HI> behaviour, which is the characteri&s;tic of women!</P>

<P>HE is gone: Gone indeed! Went early this morn|ing. Every mouth was la&s;t night, it &s;eems, full of his prai&s;es: The men admire him as much as the women. I am glad of it, methinks; &s;ince that is an indirect confe&s;&s;ion, that there are few among them like him. Not &s;o much &s;uperiority over our Sex therefore, in the other, in general, with their <HI>enlarged hearts.</HI> Have not we a Clementina, a Mrs. Shirley, and a long &amp;c?&mdash;I prai&s;e <HI>you</HI> not, my dear Lady L. and Lady G. to your faces; &s;o I leave the &amp;c. untran&s;lated. We do <HI>&s;o</HI> look upon one another here! Are <HI>&s;o</HI> un&s;a|tisfied with our&s;elves! We are not half &s;o good com|pany as we were <HI>before</HI> Sir Charles came among us. How can that be? But my Grandmamma has left us too!&mdash;that's one thing. She is retired to Shirley|manor, to mortify, after &s;o rich a regale: Tho&s;e were her words.</P>
<P>I hope your brother will write to us. Should I not have a&s;ked him? To be &s;ure he will; except his next Letters from Italy &s;hould be&mdash;But, no doubt, he will
<PB N="224" REF="225">
write to us. Mr. Greville vows to my uncle, he will not come near me. He can le&s;s and le&s;s, he &s;ays, bear to think of my marrying; tho' he does what he can to comfort him&s;elf with reflecting on the extra|ordinary merit of the man, who alone, he &s;ays, can de&s;erve me. He wi&s;hes the day were over; and the D&mdash;l's in him, he adds, if the irrevocablene&s;s of the event does not cure him. Mr. Fenwick had ye&s;terday his final an&s;wer from Lucy; and he is to &s;et out on Monday for Carli&s;le. He declares, that he will not return without a wife: So, thank Heaven, his heart is whole, notwith&s;tanding his double di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>BUT my heart is &s;et on hearing how the excellent Clementina takes the news of your brother's actual addre&s;s, and probability of &s;ucceeding. I &s;hould not think it at all &s;upri&s;ing, if, urged as &s;he is, to marry a man indifferent to her (the Lord of her heart un|married) &s;he &s;hould retract&mdash;O my Charlotte!&mdash;What a variety of &s;trange, &s;trange, What-&s;hall-I-call them? would re&s;ult from &s;uch a retractation and re|newal of claim! I never thought my&s;elf &s;uper&s;titious; but the happine&s;s before me is &s;o much beyond my merit, that I can hardly flatter my&s;elf, at times, that it will take place.</P>
<P>WHAT think you, my dear, made me write &s;o ap|prehen&s;ively?&mdash;My aunt had ju&s;t &s;hewn me a Letter &s;he had written to you&mdash;de&s;iring you&mdash;to exerci&s;e for us your fancy, your judgment.

<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>Monday Night, Oct. <HI>30.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR humanity, my dear and ever-dear Mi&s;s Byron, was &s;o much engaged by the melan|choly Letter of Sir Hargrave to Dr. Bartlett, which I communicated to you; and by the di&s;tre&s;s of my Beauchamp, on the de&s;perate &s;tate of his father's health; that I know you will be plea&s;ed to hear that I have been enabled to give &s;ome con&s;olation to both.</P>
<P>Sir Harry, who is in town, wanted to open his mind to me with regard (to &s;ome affairs which made him ex|tremely unea&s;y; and which, he &s;aid, he could not re|veal to any-body el&s;e. He &s;hewed &s;ome reluctance to entru&s;t the &s;ecrets to <HI>my</HI> bo&s;om. There &s;hall they ever re&s;t. He has found him&s;elf ea&s;ier &s;ince. He re|joiced to me on the good under&s;tanding &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and likely to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, between his Lady and Son. He de|&s;ired me to excu&s;e him for joining me with them, without a&s;king my leave, in the tru&s;ts created by his Will: And on this occa&s;ion, &s;ending for his Lady, he put her hand in mine, and recommended her and her intere&s;ts, as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t obliging of wives, to my care.</P>
<P>I found Sir Hargrave at his hou&s;e in Cavendi&s;h-Square.
<PB N="226" REF="227">
He is exce&s;&s;ively low-&s;pirited. Dr. Bartlett vi&s;ited him at Wind&s;or, &s;everal times. The Doctor prevailed on him to retain a worthy clergyman, as his chaplain.</P>
<P>The poor man a&s;ked after you, madam. He had heard, he &s;aid, that I was &s;oon likely to be the hap|pie&s;t of men: Was it &s;o? He wept at my an&s;wer; lamented the wretched hand, as he called it, that <HI>he</HI> had made of it, ble&s;&s;ed as he was with &s;uch pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, in the prime of youth; and wi&s;hed he had his days to come over again, and his company to choo&s;e. Unhappy man! He was willing to remove from <HI>him&s;elf</HI> the load which lay upon him. No doubt but this was the recour&s;e of his companions, likewi&s;e, in extremity. He ble&s;&s;ed my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, when I told him, &s;he pitied him. He called him&s;elf by har&s;h, and even &s;hocking names, for having been capable of offending &s;o much goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>What &s;ubjects are the&s;e, to entertain my Angel with!&mdash;But tho' we &s;hould not <HI>&s;eek,</HI> yet we ought not perhaps to <HI>&s;hun</HI> them, when they naturally, as I may &s;ay, offer them&s;elves to our knowlege.</P>
<P>But <HI>another</HI> &s;ubject calls for the attention of my deare&s;t, lovelie&s;t of women: A &s;ubject that will lay a &s;till &s;tronger claim to it than either of the &s;olemn ones I have touched upon. I inclo&s;e the Letter which con|tains it. You will be &s;o good as to read it in Engli&s;h to &s;uch of our friends as read not Italian.</P>
<P>This Letter was left to Mrs. Beaumont to di&s;patch to me; whence its unwi&s;hed-for delay: For &s;he de|tained it, to &s;end with it an equally-obliging one of her own. The contents of this welcome Letter, my dear|e&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, will render it unnece&s;&s;ary to wait for an an&s;wer to my la&s;t to Signor Jeronymo; in which I acquaint him with my actual addre&s;s, and the hopes I pre&s;ume to flatter my&s;elf with. I humbly hope you will think &s;o.</P>
<P>I am not afraid that one of the mo&s;t generous of
<PB N="227" REF="228">
women will be affected with the pa&s;&s;age in which Signor Jeronymo expre&s;&s;es his pity for her, becau&s;e of the affection, he &s;ays, I mu&s;t ever retain for his noble &s;i&s;ter <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 236.</NOTE>. He &s;ays right. And it is my hap|pine&s;s, that you, the &s;i&s;ter-excellence of the admirable Clementina, will allow me to glory in my <HI>gratitude</HI> to her. You will &s;till more readily allow me &s;o to do, when you have peru&s;ed this Letter. Shall not the man who hopes to be qualified for the Supreme Love, of which the pure&s;t Earthly is but a type, and who aims at an univer&s;al benevolence, be able to admire, in the mind of Clementina, the &s;ame great qualities which &s;hine out with &s;uch lu&s;tre in that of Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P>With what pride do I look forward to the vi&s;it that &s;everal of this noble family intend to make us, becau&s;e of the <HI>unque&s;tionable</HI> a&s;&s;urance that they will rejoice in my happine&s;s, and admire the Angel who is allowed to take place in my affections, of the Angel who would not have &s;crupled to accept of my vows, had it not been, as &s;he expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See p. 240.</NOTE>, for the <HI>interven|tion of invincible ob&s;tacles!</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont, in her Letter, gives me the parti|culars of the conver&s;ation between her and Clemen|tina, almo&s;t in the &s;ame words with tho&s;e of Jero|nymo, in the Letter inclo&s;ed. She makes no doubt that Lady Clementina will, in time, yield to the en|treaties of her friends in favour of a man again&s;t whom, if &s;he can be prevailed upon to forego her wi&s;hes to a&s;&s;ume the veil, &s;he can have no one ob|jection. You will &s;ee madam, by the inclo&s;ed, what they hope for in Italy from us; what Clementina, what Jeronymo, what a whole excellent family, hope for. You know how ardently my <HI>own</HI> family wi&s;h you to accelerate the happy day: Yours refer them|&s;elves wholly to you&mdash;Pardon me, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, I will tell you what are my hopes&mdash;They are,
<PB N="228" REF="229">
that, when I am permitted to return to Northampton|&s;hire, the happy day &s;hall not be po&s;tponed <HI>three.</HI></P>
<P>And now, lovelie&s;t and deare&s;t of women! allow me to expect the honour of a line, to let me know how much of the tedious month, from la&s;t Thur&s;day you will be &s;o good as to abate. Permit me to &s;ay, that I can have nothing that needs to detain me from the beloved of my heart, after Friday next.</P>
<P>If, madam, you in&s;i&s;t upon the <HI>whole</HI> month, I beg to know, out of what part of our nuptial life, the LAST or the FIRST (happy, as I hope it will be) you would be willing to deduct the week, the fort|night, that will be carried into the blank &s;pace of court&s;hip, by the delay? I hope, my dear Mi&s;s Byron, that I &s;hall be able to tell <HI>you,</HI> years and years after we are ONE, that there is not an hour of tho&s;e pa&s;t, or of tho&s;e to come, that I would abate, or wi&s;h to throw into that <HI>blank.</HI> Permit me &s;o to call it. The days of court&s;hip cannot be <HI>our</HI> happie&s;t. Who cele|brates the day of their fir&s;t acquaintance, tho' it may be remembred with plea&s;ure?&mdash;Do not the happy pair date their happine&s;s from the day of marriage? How ju&s;tly then when hearts are <HI>a&s;&s;ured,</HI> when minds <HI>can|not alter,</HI> are tho&s;e which precede it, to be deemed a blank!</P>
<P>After all, your <HI>chearful</HI> compliance with my wi&s;hes, is the great de&s;ireable. Whatever &s;hall be your plea|&s;ure, mu&s;t determine me. My utmo&s;t gratitude will be engaged by the conde&s;cen&s;ion, <HI>whenever</HI> you &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h the day of the year, di&s;tingui&s;hed as it will be to the end of my life, that &s;hall give me the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of it, and confirm me</P>

<P>[Inclo&s;ed in the preceding.]</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bologna, <DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 18. N. S.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Gave you, my dear Grandi&s;on, in mine of the 5th, the copy of a paper written by my &s;i&s;ter, which filled us with hopes of her compliance with the wi&s;hes of all her family. She took time for deliberation; time was given her; but &s;till &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on receiving your next Letters before &s;he came to any re&s;olution. Mrs. Beaumont her&s;elf was of opinion, that the dear creature only meditated delay: That al&s;o was ours. What, invincibly determined, as &s;he is, to adhere to the re&s;olution &s;he has &s;o greatly taken, can &s;he hope for, (&s;aid we among our&s;elves) from the expected Letters? For &s;he had declared her&s;elf to be <HI>&s;o</HI> determined, to my brother Giacomo, who actually a&s;&s;ured her of all our con&s;ents to an alliance with you, if &s;he repented of that re&s;olution.</P>
<P>All this time we offered not to introduce, nor even to name, to her, the Count of Belvedere. Awed by her former calamity, and by an excur&s;ivene&s;s of ima|gination, which at times &s;hewed it&s;elf in her words and behaviour, we avoided &s;aying or doing any-thing that was likely to di&s;turb her. Giacomo him&s;elf, tho' he wanted to return to Naples, had patience with her pretty trifling, beyond our expectation. At la&s;t ar|rived yours of the 29th of September <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter v. p. 13.</NOTE>; kindly in|clo&s;ing a copy of yours to her, of the &s;ame date <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Letter iv. p. 11.</NOTE>. We que&s;tion not but your reply to mine of the 5th current, is on the road; not that the contents will be &s;uch as we may hope for, from con&s;iderations of our happine&s;s and your own: But the&s;e, we thought,
<PB N="230" REF="231">
without waiting for that, would an&s;wer the de&s;ired end. I will tell you what was &s;aid by every one, on the pe|ru&s;al of both.</P>
<P>Is this the man, &s;aid the General, whom I &s;ome|times &s;o rudely treated? I rejoice that we were recon|ciled before he left us. I had formed a notion to his di&s;advantage; that he was capable of art, and hoped to keep his hold in my &s;i&s;ter's affections, in view of &s;ome turn in his favour: But he is the mo&s;t &s;ingle|hearted of men. The&s;e two Letters will &s;trengthen our arguments. Clementina, who has more than once declared that &s;he wi&s;hes him married to an Eng|li&s;h woman, cannot now, that &s;he will &s;ee there is a woman with whom he thinks he can be happy, wi&s;h to &s;tand in his way. The&s;e will furni&s;h us with means to attack her in her &s;tronge&s;t hold; in her genero&s;ity, her delicacy; and will bring to the te&s;t her vera|city. The contents of the&s;e Letters will confirm her before half-taken re&s;olution, as in her paper, to oblige us <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 88. of this Volume.</NOTE>. Let <HI>Laurana,</HI> as the Chevalier &s;ays, go into a nunnery: Clementina will marry, or &s;he is a fal&s;e girl; and the Sforza woman will be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>My mother applauded you, and rejoiced to hear that there is a woman of your own nation who is ca|pable of making you more happy than her daughter could.</P>
<P>What difficulties, &s;aid the young Marchione&s;s, (ever your friend) mu&s;t a &s;ituation &s;o critical have laid him under! A man &s;o humane! And what further difficulties mu&s;t he have to &s;urmunt, in offering to a woman, whom even Olivia, as he &s;ays, admires, a hand that has been refu&s;ed by another? May this ad|mired woman be propitious to his &s;uit!</P>
<P>She mu&s;t, &s;he mu&s;t, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop. If &s;he has a heart di&s;engaged, &s;he cannot refu&s;e a man &s;o ac|compli&s;hed. Jeronymo, ha&s;ten to be well. If &s;he favour him, we will all go over, and congratulate them both.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="232">
I, for my part, &s;aid I, would give up years of life to &s;ee my friend as happy in marriage as he de&s;erves to be.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t tell Clementina, &s;aid my father, as our Giacomo has hinted, that it will not become her ge|nero&s;ity to &s;tand in the way of the Chevalier's hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>We &s;ent up your Letter to our &s;i&s;ter, by Camilla. She was bu&s;y (Mrs. Beaumont &s;itting by her at work) in correcting the proportion which once you found fault with, in a figure in her piece of Noah's Ark, and the ri&s;ing Deluge. A Letter, madam, from the Che|valier&mdash;To me! &s;aid &s;he; and overturned the table on which her materials lay, in ha&s;te to take it.</P>
<P>When we thought &s;he had had time to con&s;ider of the contents, we &s;ent up to reque&s;t the favour of &s;peaking with Mrs. Beaumont. We owned to her, that we had a copy of your Letter to Clementina; and a&s;ked, What the dear creature &s;aid to the con|tents of it?</P>
<P>She read it, an&s;wered Mrs. Beaumont, in her own clo&s;et. I thought &s;he was too long by her&s;elf. I went to her. She was in tears. O Mrs. Beaumont! as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me, holding out the Letter&mdash;See here!&mdash;The <HI>Chevalier</HI> is again&s;t me!&mdash;Cruel, I could <HI>almo&s;t</HI> &s;ay, cruel Grandi&s;on!&mdash;He turns my own words upon me. I have furni&s;hed him with argu|ments again&s;t my&s;elf&mdash;What &s;hall I do?&mdash;I have for many days pa&s;t repented that I gave, under my hand, rea&s;on to my friends to expect my compliance. I can|not, cannot, confirm the hopes I gave!&mdash;What &s;hall I do?</P>
<P>I took it, read it, continued Mrs. Beaumont, and told her, that the Chevalier's arguments were un|an&s;werable. I dwelt upon &s;ome of them. She wept, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>We then, my dear Grandi&s;on, &s;hewed Mrs. Beau|mont your Letter to me. She read it&mdash;How, &s;aid
<PB N="232" REF="233">
&s;he, has this excellent young man been embara&s;&s;ed! I know, from &s;ome of my countrymen, the character of the Lady whom he mentions: She is an excellent woman!&mdash;May I take up this Letter, and read it to Lady Clementina?</P>
<P>By all means, an&s;wered the General; and &s;upport, dear madam, the contents of both with your weight. It will be from perver&s;ene&s;s <HI>now,</HI> if &s;he with&s;tand us. Bid her remember, that &s;he has had once at her feet a kneeling father! Bid her remember the written hopes &s;he has given us!</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont went up with it. I will give you an account of what my &s;i&s;ter &s;aid as &s;he read it. O Grandi&s;on! read it but cur&s;orily: You will more and more admire and love the Clementina, who, before her malady, was always con&s;idered as one of the fir&s;t of women; and the glory of our hou&s;e!</P>
<P>She de&s;ired to have it in her own hands: Mrs. Beaumont, to who&s;e pen we owe the account, looked over her, and followed her eye, as &s;he read <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter v. p. 13. of this Volume.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Then folding up the Letter, and putting it in her bo&s;om; This Letter, and that which accompanied it, (meaning yours to her) I mu&s;t read over and over!</P>
<P>Shall I &s;ay, my Grandi&s;on, that I half-pity the lovely Harriet Byron, tho' her name &s;hould be changed to yours? You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> love Clementina: Were a &s;o|vereign Prince&s;s her rival, you <HI>mu&s;t.</HI> Clementina! who &s;o generou&s;ly can give up a Love as fervent as ever glowed in a virgin heart, on &s;uperior motives; motives which regard Eternity; and receive joy in the pro&s;pect of your happine&s;s with another woman, on a per&s;ua&s;ion that that woman can make you hap|pier than &s;he her&s;elf could, becau&s;e of a difference in Religion.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter choo&s;ing to retire to her clo&s;et, to re|peru&s;e the two Letters, Mrs. Beaumont, knowing our curio&s;ity, put down what had pa&s;&s;ed; intending, as &s;he &s;aid, to write a copy of it for you.</P>
<P>How were we all, on peru&s;ing it, charmed with our Clementina!&mdash;I in&s;i&s;ted, that nothing, at pre&s;ent, &s;hould be &s;aid to her of the Count of Belvedere, and of our wi&s;hes in his favour. My father gave into my opinion. He &s;aid, he thought the propere&s;t time to
<PB N="237" REF="238">
mention the Count to her was, when we had an an|&s;wer to the Letter I wrote to you on the 5th current, if that could give us a&s;&s;urances that you had made your addre&s;&s;es to the charming Byron, and were encou|raged. The General was impatient; but he acqui|e&s;ced, on finding every one come into my motion; but &s;aid, that if all this lenity did not do, he mu&s;t beg leave to have his own mea&s;ures pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>SOME little particularity has appeared in the dear creature &s;ince I have written the above. She has been exceedingly earne&s;t with her mother, to u&s;e her in|tere&s;t with my father, and us, to be allowed to go to England: But de&s;ires not the permi&s;&s;ion till you are actually married. She pleads my health, becau&s;e of the &s;alutary &s;prings you mention to me.</P>
<P>Several other pleas &s;he offered; but, to &s;ay truth, they carried with them &s;uch an air of flightine&s;s, that I am loth to mention them: Yet all of them were innocent, all of them were even laudable. But (&s;hall I &s;ay?) that &s;ome of them appeared too romantic for a &s;ettled brain to be &s;o earne&s;t, as &s;he was, in having them carried into execution.</P>
<P>We have no doubt, but all her view is, to avoid marriage, by &s;uch a &s;trange excur&s;ion. Dear creature, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, &s;peaking of her ju&s;t now, the veil de|nied her, &s;he mu&s;t have <HI>&s;ome</HI> point to carry: I wi&s;h we &s;aw le&s;s rapidity in her manner.</P>
<P>I, Grandi&s;on, for my part, remember how much &s;he and we all &s;uffered by denying her the farewel-vi&s;it from you, on your taking leave of Italy the time before the la&s;t.</P>
<P>But we think an expedient has offered, that will divert her from this <HI>wildne&s;s,</HI> as I mu&s;t call it: Mrs. Beaumont has reque&s;ted, that &s;he may be allowed to take her with her to Florence for &s;ome weeks. Cle|mentina is plea&s;ed with our readine&s;s to oblige them both; and they will &s;oon go.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239">
But all this time &s;he is uniform and &s;teady in her wi&s;hes for your marriage. She delights to hear Mrs. Beaumont talk of the perfections of the Lady to whom we are all de&s;irous of hearing you are united. You had written, it &s;eems, to Mrs. Beaumont, a character given of this young Lady by Olivia, upon a per&s;onal knowlege of her. Mrs. Beaumont &s;hewed it to Cle|mentina.</P>
<P>How generou&s;ly did the dear creature rejoice in it! Ju&s;t &s;uch a woman, &s;aid &s;he, did I wi&s;h for the Che|valier. Olivia has &s;hewn greatne&s;s of mind in this in&s;tance.

<P>YOU will be plea&s;ed, I know, my Grandi&s;on, with every particular that &s;hall tend to demon&s;trate the plea&s;ure the dear Clementina takes in hoping you will be &s;oon the happy man we all wi&s;h you to be.</P>
<P>This morning &s;he came down with her work into my chamber. I invite my&s;elf, Jeronymo, &s;aid &s;he. I will &s;it down by you, till you are di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;e. She then, of her own motion, began to talk of you; and I, putting it to her (as her mother did ye&s;terday) whether &s;he would be really glad to hear of your nup|tials, received the &s;ame an&s;wer &s;he then made; <HI>She &s;incerely &s;hould:</HI> She hoped the next Letters would bring an account that it was &s;o. But then, Jeronymo, continued &s;he, I &s;hall be teazed, per&s;ecuted. Let me not, my brother, be per&s;ecuted. I don't know, whe|ther downright compul&s;ion is not more tolerable than over-earne&s;t entreaty. A child, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, may contract her&s;elf, as I may &s;ay, within her own compa&s;s; may be hardened: But the entreaty of &s;uch
<PB N="239" REF="240">
friends as undoubtedly mean one's good, dilates and di&s;arms one's heart, and makes one wi&s;h to oblige them; and &s;o renders one mi&s;erable, whether we do or do not comply. Believe me, Jeronymo, there is great cruelty in per&s;ua&s;ion, and &s;till more to a &s;oft and gentle temper, than to a &s;tubborn one: Per&s;uaders know not what they make &s;uch a per&s;on &s;uffer.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Clementina, &s;aid I, you have &s;hewn &s;o glorious a magnanimity, that it would be injuring you, to &s;uppo&s;e you are not equal to every branch of <HI>duty.</HI> God forbid that you &s;hould be called to &s;u&s;tain an un|rea&s;onable trial&mdash;In a rea&s;onable one, you mu&s;t be victorious.</P>
<P>Ah Jeronymo! How little do I de&s;erve this fine compliment!&mdash;Magnanimity, my brother!&mdash;You know not what I yet, at times, &s;uffer!&mdash;And have you not &s;een my rea&s;on vanqui&s;hed in the unequal conflict? She wept. But let the Chevalier be married, and to the Angel that is talked of; and let me confort my&s;elf, that he is not a &s;ufferer by my with-holding my hand&mdash;And <HI>then</HI> let me be in|dulged in the &s;ingle life, in a place con&s;ecrated to re|tirement from this vain world; and we &s;hall <HI>both</HI> be happy!</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont came to &s;eek her. I prevailed on her to &s;it down, and on my &s;i&s;ter to &s;tay a little longer. I extolled my &s;i&s;ter to her: She joined in the ju&s;t prai&s;e. But one act of magnanimity, &s;aid Mrs. Beau|mont, &s;eems wanting to complete the greatne&s;s of your character, my Love, in this particular ca&s;e of the expected marriage of the Chevalier Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>What is that, Mrs. Beaumont?&mdash;All attention.</P>
<P>You &s;ee his doubts, his apprehen&s;ions, of appearing worthy of the Lady &s;o highly &s;poken of, becau&s;e of that delicacy of &s;ituation (which, as you ob&s;erve, Oli|via al&s;o hints at) from what may be called a divided Love: Mi&s;s Byron may very well imagine, as his
<PB N="240" REF="241">
Love of you commenced before he knew her, that &s;he may injure you if &s;he receive his addre&s;&s;es: You had the genero&s;ity to wi&s;h, when you were reading tho&s;e his apprehen&s;ions, that you <HI>knew</HI> the Lady, and were able to influence her in his favour.</P>
<P>Well, Mrs. Beaumont&mdash;</P>
<P>Can I doubt that Lady Clementina is <HI>able</HI> to &s;et her name to the noble &s;entiments, that &s;o lately, on read|ing his Letter, flowed from her lips?</P>
<P>What would Mrs. Beaumont have me do?</P>
<P>Let me lead you to your own clo&s;et. Pen, ink, and paper, are always before you there. A&s;&s;ume your whole noble Self, and we &s;hall &s;ee what that a&s;&s;ump|tion will produce.</P>
<P>All that is in my power, to do, replied &s;he, for promoting the happine&s;s of a man who has &s;uffered &s;o much through my means, it is my duty to do.</P>
<P>She gave her hand to Mrs. Beaumont; who led her to her clo&s;et, and left her there. The following is the re&s;ult. Generous, noble creature!&mdash;But does it not &s;hew a rai&s;ed imagination? e&s;pecially in the di&s;|po&s;ition of the lines?</P>

<OPENER><DATE>Tue&s;day, Oct. <HI>31.</HI></DATE>
<SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will think your ward very bold to addre&s;s you by Letter; e&s;pecially as &s;he is a very poor inditer, and as you are in town: But her heart is in trouble, and &s;he mu&s;t write; and mu&s;t beg the favour of you, the mo&s;t indulgent guardian that ever poor Orphan had, to an&s;wer her by pen and ink. For whether you can forgive her or not, &s;he will be equally incapable of bearing your goodne&s;s, or your di&s;plea&s;ure&punc; How weakly I expre&s;s my&s;elf! I find I &s;hall write wor&s;e to you, than to any-body el&s;e. And why? Becau&s;e I wi&s;h to write, be&s;t. But I have great awe, and no genius. I am a poor girl in <HI>every</HI> &s;en&s;e, as you &s;hall hear by-and-by. I hope you won't be <HI>very</HI> angry with me. If you are, I &s;hall be wor&s;e than poor&mdash;I &s;hall be mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>But to come before my guardian as a delinquent, when I have ambition enough to wi&s;h to &s;hine in his eyes, if &s;o it could have been!&mdash;It is a very great mortification indeed!&mdash;If you were to acquit me, I &s;hall have had great puni&s;hment in that thought.</P>
<P>But to open my troubled heart to you&mdash;Yet how &s;hall I; I thought to tell it you ye&s;terday; but for my
<PB N="244" REF="245">
life I could not. Did you not ob&s;erve me once, Sir, hanging upon the back of your chair, unable to &s;tand in your &s;ight? O how I felt my face glow!&mdash;<HI>Then</HI> it <HI>was</HI> I thought to have &s;poken my mind; but you were &s;o kind, &s;o good to me, I could not, might I have had the world. You took my hand&mdash;I &s;hall be very bold to repeat it; but am always &s;o proud of your kind notice, that I can't help it: And you &s;aid, drawing me gently to you, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Why keeps my Emily behind me? What can I do for my Emily! Tell me, child; Is there any-thing I can do for my ward?'</Q> Yet, tho' the occa&s;ion was &s;o fair, I could not tell you. But I &s;hall tire you, before I came to the point (to the fault, I &s;hould &s;ay) that has emboldened me to write.</P>
<P>This then is the truth of the matter:</P>
<P>My poor mother, Sir, is very good now, you know. You have taken from her all her cares about this world: She and her hu&s;band live together happily and elegantly: They want for nothing; and are grown quite religious: So that they have lei&s;ure to think of their Souls good. They make me cry for joy, when|ever I go to them. They pray for you, and heap ble&s;&s;ings upon you; and cry to think they ever of|fended you.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I took it into my head, knowing it was a va&s;t way for them to go from Soho to &s;omewhere in Moorfields to hear the preacher they admire &s;o much, and coach-hire, and charities, and <HI>contributions,</HI> of one kind or other (for their mini&s;ter has no e&s;tabli&s;hment) and old debts paying off, that at pre&s;ent, tho' I believe they are frugal enough, they can't be much afore|hand&mdash;So, thought I, &s;hall I ride in my guardian's coach, at one time, in Lady G's at another, in Lady L's at another, tho' &s;o much better able to walk than my poor mother; while &s;he is growing into years, and when infirmities are coming on; and my guar|dian's example before me, &s;o opening to one's heart?&mdash;I ventured, therefore, unknown to my mother and
<PB N="245" REF="246">
her hu&s;band, unknown to any-body, by way of &s;ur|prize, to be&s;peak a plain neat chariot, and agreed for a coachman, and a pair of hor&s;es; for I had about 130 guineas by me when I be&s;poke it. Out of this, thought I (which is my own money, without account) I &s;hall be able to &s;pare enough for the fir&s;t half-year's expences; after which, they will be in circum&s;tances to keep it on: And as quarters come round, thought I, I will &s;tint my&s;elf, and throw in &s;omething towards it; and then my poor mother and her hu&s;band can go to &s;erve God, and take &s;ometimes an airing, or &s;o, where they plea&s;e; and make an appearance in the world, as the mother of the girl who is intitled to &s;o large a fortune. And I don't grudge Mr. O-Hara; for he is va&s;tly tender of my mother now: Which mu&s;t be a great comfort to her, you know, Sir, now &s;he is come to be &s;orry for pa&s;t things, and apt to be very &s;piritle&s;s, when &s;he looks back&mdash;Poor dear wo|man!</P>
<P>But here, Sir, was the thing: Believing it became me, as Lady L. Lady G. and Mrs. Eleanor Gran|di&s;on, intended to &s;hew their re&s;pect to you, on a cer|tain happy occa&s;ion, by new cloaths, to &s;hew mine the &s;ame way; I went to the mercer's, and was &s;o tempted by two patterns, that, not knowing which to choo&s;e, I bought of both; not thinking, at the time, of the be&s;poken chariot. To be &s;ure I ought to have con&s;ulted Lady L. or Lady G.; but, fooli&s;h creature as I was, I mu&s;t be for &s;urpri&s;ing them too, with my fine fancy.</P>
<P>Then I laid out a good deal more than I intended, in milanery matters: Not but I had my pennyworths for my penny: But the milaners are &s;o very obliging; they &s;hew one this pretty thing, and that fa&s;hionable one; and are &s;o apt to prai&s;e one's ta&s;te; and one is &s;o willing to believe them, and to be thought mighty clever; that there is no re&s;i&s;ting the vanity they rai&s;e. I own all my folly: I ever will, Sir, when I am guilty
<PB N="246" REF="247">
of any greater &s;illine&s;s than ordinary; for I have no bad heart, I hope, tho' I am one of the flowers I once heard you compare &s;ome of us to, who are late before they blow into di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>But now, good Sir, came on my di&s;tre&s;s: For the be&s;poken chariot was ready; ready &s;ooner by a fort|night, than I expected. I thought my quarter would be nearer ended; and I had made a va&s;t hole in my money. I pulled up a courage; I had need of it; and borrowed fifty guineas of Lady G.; but, from this fooli&s;h love of &s;urprizes, cared not to tell her for what. And having occa&s;ion to pay two or three bills (I was a thoughtle&s;s creature, to be &s;ure) which un|luckily, tho' I had a&s;ked for them before, were brought in ju&s;t then, I borrowed another &s;um, but <HI>yet</HI> told not Lady G. for what; and the dear Lady, I believe, thought me an extravagant girl; I &s;aw &s;he did, by her looks.</P>
<P>But, however, I cau&s;ed the new chariot to be brought privately to me. I went in it, and it car|ried me to Soho; and there, on my knees, made my pre&s;ent to my mother.</P>
<P>But do you think, Sir, that &s;he and Mr. O-Hara, when I confe&s;&s;ed that I had not con&s;ulted you upon it, and that neither Lady L. nor Lady G. nor yet Mrs. Eleanor Grandi&s;on, knew a &s;yllable of the matter, would accept of it? They would not: But yet they both cried over me for joy, and ble&s;&s;ed me.</P>
<P>It is put up &s;omewhere And there it lies, till I have obtained your pardon fir&s;t, and your direction after|wards. And what &s;hall I do, if you are angry at your por ward, who has done &s;o incon&s;iderate a thing, and run her&s;elf into debt?</P>
<P>Chide me, honoured Sir, if you plea&s;e. Indeed you never <HI>yet</HI> did chide me. But yours will be chide|ings of Love; of <HI>paternal</HI> Love, Sir.</P>
<P>But if you are angry with me more than a day; if you give me rea&s;on to believe you think meanly of me,
<PB N="247" REF="248">
tho', alas! I may de&s;erve it; and that this ra&s;hne&s;s is but a prelude to other ra&s;h or conceited &s;teps (for that is the fear which mo&s;t terrifies me) and is therefore to be re&s;ented with &s;everity; then will I fly to my dear Mi&s;s Byron, that now is!&mdash;And if &s;he cannot &s;often your di&s;plea&s;ure, and re&s;tore me to your <HI>good opinion</HI>&mdash;(Mere pardon will not be enough for your truly-pe|nitent ward) then will I &s;ay, Bur&s;t, heart! Ingrateful, incon&s;iderate Emily! Thou ha&s;t offended thy Guar|dian! What is there left in this life, that is worth thy cares!</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I have laid my troubled heart open before you. I know you will not &s;o much blame the thing, even &s;hould you not approve of it, as the manner; doing it (after you had been &s;o extreme|ly generous and incon&s;iderate to my mother) with|out con&s;ulting either you, or your &s;i&s;ters. O my vanity and conceit! They, they have mi&s;led me. They never &s;hall again, whether you forgive me, or not.</P>
<P>But good, indulgent, honoured Sir, my Guardian, my Protector, let not my puni&s;hment be the rever&s;ing of the gracious grant which my heart has been &s;o long wi&s;hing to obtain, and which you had con&s;ented to, of being allowed to live immediately in your own eye, and in the pre&s;ence of my dear Mi&s;s Byron, that now is. This ra&s;h action &s;hould rather induce you to con|firm, than rever&s;e it. And I promi&s;e to be very good. I ever loved her. I &s;hall add filial honour, as I may &s;ay, to my love of her. I never will do any-thing without con&s;ulting her; and but what you, the kinde&s;t Guardian that ever poor Orphan had, would wi&s;h me to do.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, honour me with a few lines from your own hand; were it but to &s;hew me that this im|pertinence has not &s;o far tired you, as (&s;hould you think it ju&s;t to bani&s;h me from your pre&s;ence for <HI>&s;ome time)</HI>

<P>I Write to the dear child of my tendere&s;t cares, be|cau&s;e &s;he reque&s;ts me to write: El&s;e, I had ha&s;t|ened to her in per&s;on, to comfort her doubting heart; and to a&s;&s;ure her, that nothing but a fault premedi|tated, and per&s;i&s;ted in, that might have affected her pre&s;ent or future reputation, and con&s;equently her hap|pine&s;s, could make me, for half an hour, offended with her. Your good intentions, my dear child, will ever be your &s;ecurity with me. Men, as well as women, are often mi&s;led by their love of &s;urprizes: But the greate&s;t &s;urprize my Emily could give me, would be, if &s;he could do any <HI>one</HI> thing that would &s;hew a faulty heart.</P>
<P>Once more, my dear, pay your duty to your mo|ther in the chariot which has been the cau&s;le&s;s occa|&s;ion of &s;o much concern to you; and tell her, and Mr. O-Hara, that they have greatly obliged me in declining the acceptance of the chariot, &s;o dutifully pre&s;ented, till they knew my mind: But that, not &s;o much in the compliment paid to me, as your <HI>guar|dian,</HI> as becau&s;e it has given me an opinion of their own genero&s;ity and di&s;cretion. Tell them, that I greatly approve of this in&s;tance of your duty to your mother, and of your regard, for her &s;ake, to Mr. O-Hara: Tell them, that I join with my ever-amiable ward in reque&s;ting their acceptance of it; and do you,

<P>I thank you, my deare&s;t ward, for the affection you expre&s;s for my beloved Mi&s;s Byron.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, Nov. <HI>2.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have laid before you, my dear Lady G. your bro|ther's and Signor Jeronymo's Letters; as al&s;o my an&s;wer to your brother's: My &s;pirits never were &s;o unequal. All joy at one time; apprehen&s;ion at an|other; that &s;omething will &s;till happen.&mdash;Greville is reported to be &s;o gloomy! &s;o &s;ilent! He hates me, he &s;ays.&mdash;And here, unexpectedly, is poor Mr. Orme returned. Amended in his health a little, tho&s;e who have &s;een him &s;ay, and he thinks &s;o&mdash;I am glad of it. And here are we &s;itting in judgment, my aunt Lady|pre&s;ident, on the patterns you have &s;ent: My uncle too will have his opinion be taken&mdash;And Mr. Deane, who threatened he would not come to Selby-hou&s;e till the Settlements were to be &s;igned, or read, I cannot tell what&mdash;will be here on Saturday.</P>
<P>MR. Orme has de&s;ired leave to vi&s;it me to-morrow. My uncle &s;o hurries my &s;pirit; not with his raillery, as he u&s;ed to do&mdash;but with his joy. He talks of no|thing but the coming down of your brother, and the limited three days after; and numbers the days, nay, the hours, as they fly: For he &s;uppo&s;es Sir Charles will be here on Monday, at furthe&s;t; and calls that a delay of particular grace and favour. For has he not &s;aid, &s;ays he, that nothing after Friday can, on his part, detain him from us?</P>
<P>But, Lady G. will he not write, before he comes, to my la&s;t? Say my uncle what he plea&s;es, your
<PB N="252" REF="253">
brother can't be down before Saturday &s;e'nnight, at &s;oone&s;t.</P>
<P>Your fancy and Lady L's determine us. My aunt has undertaken this province: She therefore will write to you what &s;he thinks fit. Is there not too much glare in the flowered &s;ilver, as you de&s;cribe it? Don't, my dear, let me be a bride in a ma&s;querade habit. Humility becomes per&s;ons of &s;ome degree. We want not glare: We are <HI>known</HI> to be able to afford rich dre&s;&s;es; need them not, therefore to give us con&s;e|quence: Simplicity only can be elegance. Let me not be gaudy: Let not fancy, or art, or &s;tudy, be &s;een in my dre&s;&s;es. Something mu&s;t be done, I grant, on our <HI>appearance;</HI> for an an appearance we mu&s;t not di&s;pen&s;e with here in the country, whatever you wo|men of quality may do in town. But let me not, I be&s;eech you, or as little as po&s;&s;ible, be marked out for a <HI>lu&s;tre;</HI> and be &s;o good as to throw in a hint to this purpo&s;e to the dear bu&s;y girls here, as from your|&s;elves; for they are exerci&s;ing their fancies, as if I were to be a Queen of the May. Your authorities will &s;upport me, if they give me cau&s;e to differ in opi|nion from them.</P>
<P>MISS Orme has ju&s;t been with me. She confirms her brother's amendment. She is &s;orry that his im|patience has brought him over, when the climate was &s;o favourable to him. She &s;ays, I &s;hall find him &s;in|cerely di&s;po&s;ed to congratulate me on my happy pro|&s;pect; of which &s;he has given him ample particulars. He could not, &s;he &s;ays, but expre&s;s him&s;elf plea&s;ed, that neither Fenwick nor Greville, but that one of &s;o &s;uperior a character, is to be the man.</P>
<P>What greater felicity can a young creature propo&s;e to her&s;elf, in the days of court&s;hip, than to find every one in her family, and out of it, applauding her choice? Could I, a few weeks ago, have thought&mdash;But hu&s;hed be vanity! Pride, withdraw! Meek-eyed
<PB N="253" REF="254">
Humility, &s;tand forth!&mdash;Am I indeed to be the hap|pie&s;t of women? Will nothing happen&mdash;O no, no! Heaven will protect your brother&mdash;Yet this Greville is a trouble to me. Not becau&s;e of my horrid dream; I am not &s;o &s;uper&s;titious as to let that di&s;turb me: But from a hint he gave Mi&s;s Orme.</P>
<P>She met him this morning at a neighbouring Lady's. He thus acco&s;ted her: I under&s;tand, madam, that your brother is returned. He is a happy man. Ju&s;t in time, to &s;ee Mi&s;s Byron, married. Fenwick, a dog! is gone to howl at Carli&s;le, on the occa&s;ion. Your brother and I have nothing to do but howl in reci|tative to each other, here.</P>
<P>My brother, Mr. Greville, &s;aid Mi&s;s Orme, I am &s;ure, will behave like a man on the occa&s;ion: Nor can you have rea&s;on to howl, as you call it. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is <HI>your</HI> particular friend, you know.</P>
<P>True, Mi&s;s Orme, affecting to laugh off this hit, I thought I could have braved it out; but now the matter comes near, it &s;ticks here, ju&s;t here pointing to his throat: I cannot get it through my gizzard. Plaguy hard of dige&s;tion! making faces, in his light way.</P>
<P>But will your brother, proceeded he, be contented to &s;tay within the noi&s;e of the bells, which will, (in a few days perhaps) be &s;et a ringing, for ten m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">les round? Sir Charles drives on at a d&mdash;nable rate, I hear. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But he mu&s;t let me die decently, I can tell him: We will not part for ever with the flower of our county, without conditions.'</Q> Shall <HI>you</HI> &s;ee the Siren, madam? If you do, tell her, that I have no chance for peace, but in hating her heartily. But (whi&s;pering Mi&s;s Orme) bid her NOT TO BE TOO SECURE.</P>
<P>I was &s;trangely &s;truck with the&s;e words; for my &s;pirits were not high before. I repeated them; I dwelt upon them, and wept.&mdash;Fool that I was! But
<PB N="254" REF="255">
I &s;oon recollected my&s;elf; and de&s;ired Mi&s;s Orme not to take notice of my tender folly.</P>

<P>I HAVE had a vi&s;it from Mr. Orme. He has given <HI>me</HI> &s;ome plea&s;ure. I added not to <HI>his</HI> melancholy. He a&s;ked me &s;everal intere&s;ting que&s;tions, which I would not have an&s;wered any other man, as I told him. I &s;hall always value Mr. Orme. Your brother is the mo&s;t generous of men: But were he not &s;o very generous, he ought to allow for my <HI>civility</HI> to this worthy man; &s;ince I can applaud <HI>him</HI> with my whole heart, for <HI>loving</HI> the noble Clementina. What a nar|row-hearted creature mu&s;t I be, if I did not? But as a woman's honour is of a more delicate nature, I be|lieve, than a man's with regard to <HI>per&s;onal</HI> love; &s;o perhaps (if this be allowed me) a man may be as jea|lous of a woman's <HI>civility</HI> (in general ca&s;es, I mean) as a woman may be of a man's <HI>Love</HI> to another ob|ject. This may &s;ound &s;trange, at fir&s;t hearing, Lady G. but I know what I mean. Nobody el&s;e does, Harriet, perhaps you will &s;ay. But they would, I re|ply, if I were to explain my&s;elf; which at pre&s;ent, if you apprehend me not, I have no inclination to do.</P>
<P>How did this worthy man prai&s;e Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on! He mu&s;t &s;ee that my pride, no, not pride, my gratitude, was rai&s;ed by it, as well to the <HI>prai&s;er</HI> as <HI>prai&s;ed.</HI> He concluded with a ble&s;&s;ing on us both, which he uttered in a different manner from what that Balaam-Greville uttered his: It was followed with tears, good man! and he left me almo&s;t unable to &s;peak. How grateful in our ears are the prai&s;es be|&s;towed on tho&s;e whom we fondly love!</P>
<P>Lucy thinks I had be&s;t go to my grandmamma's before he comes down; and that he &s;hould vi&s;it me there from Selby-hou&s;e. Neither my aunt nor I am of this opinion; but that he &s;hould him&s;elf go to Shirley-manor, and vi&s;it us from thence. For is not Selby-hou&s;e my u&s;ual place of re&s;idence? My grand|mamma
<PB N="255" REF="256">
will be delighted with his company, and con|ver&s;ation. But as he cannot think of coming down before the latter end of next week, at the &s;oone&s;t, it is time enough to con&s;ider of the&s;e things. Yet can a young creature, the awful &s;olemnity &s;o near, and with a man whom &s;he prefers to all others, find room in her head for any other topic?</P>
<P>I have a Letter from my good Mrs. Reeves. She and my cou&s;in are &s;o full of this happy &s;ubject, that they invite them&s;elves down to us; and hope we will excu&s;e them for their earne&s;tne&s;s on this occa&s;ion. They are prodigiou&s;ly earne&s;t. I wonder my cou&s;in can think of leaving her little boy! My aunt &s;ays, there is no denying them. How &s;o?&mdash;Surely one may excu&s;e one's &s;elf to friends one &s;o dearly loves! Your pre&s;ence, my Charlotte, I own, would be a high &s;atisfaction to me: Yet you would be a little unma|nageable, I doubt. There can be no hope of Lady L's: But if there were, neither &s;he, nor any-body el&s;e, could keep you orderly.&mdash;Poor dear Emily!&mdash;My aunt wi&s;hes, that we <HI>could</HI> have had her with us: But, for her own &s;ake, it mu&s;t not be. How often do I revolve that reflexion of your brother's; that, in our happie&s;t pro&s;pects, the &s;ighing heart will confe&s;s imper|fection!

<HEADNOTE>
<P>In a &s;mall hand, under the Super&s;cription of the inner Cover.</P>
<Q><P>My deare&s;t Lady G. pray read the fir&s;t page of this Letter, be|fore you open the other dreadful one, &s;ealed with five &s;eals, and &s;titched to the Cover (that it may not &s;lide <HI>officiou&s;ly</HI> into your hands). Lucy will have me &s;end the whole of that &s;hocking Letter. Again&s;t my judgment, I comply.</P></Q>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>WE met this morning &s;oul-le&s;s, and forlorn, all equally unable either to give or receive con&s;o|lation. The officious note was taken up, laid down, taken up again; the hand endeavoured to be gue&s;&s;ed at: And at la&s;t it was concluded, to di&s;patch a &s;er|vant to Mr. Greville's, to learn news of the &s;uppo&s;ed traitor.</P>
<P>But, behold! before the &s;ervant could return, in a riding-dre&s;s, having alighted at the outward gate, en|tered the hall your noble brother. I was the fir&s;t whom he &s;aw; the fir&s;t who &s;aw him. I was ju&s;t going out, intending (yet hardly knowing my inten|tion) to walk in the Elm-row fronting the hou&s;e, in order to &s;horten the way of the returning &s;ervant with news.</P>
<P>He ca&s;t him&s;elf at my feet. Something he &s;aid, and more he intended to &s;ay; excu&s;ing his early re|turn, and thanking me for my favour of the Wed|ne&s;day before; when my joyful &s;urprize overpowered both my &s;peech and &s;en&s;es.&mdash;And what will you &s;ay to me, when I tell you, that, on my recovery, I found my&s;elf in his arms, mine cla&s;ped about his neck?</P>
<P>He was &s;urpri&s;ed at my emotion! Well he might&mdash;Every one, in a moment, crouded about him&mdash;My
<PB N="262" REF="263">
aunt al&s;o folded her arms around him&mdash;Welcome, welcome, welcome, was all &s;he could, at the in&s;tant, &s;ay.</P>
<P>I, utterly aba&s;ned, trembling, and doubting my feet, motioned to quit the hall for the parlour&mdash;But nobody minded me; all were bu&s;ied in congratulating the joy of every heart; till Sally pre&s;enting her&s;elf, I leaned upon her, and, &s;taggering to the parlour, threw my&s;elf into an elbow-chair.</P>
<P>Your brother, attended by all my friends, followed me in. My heart again bid him welcome, tho' my eye could not, at that in&s;tant, bear his. He took my hand, as I &s;at, between both his, and, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner pre&s;&s;ing it with his lips, be&s;ought me to compo&s;e my&s;elf.</P>
<P>They had hinted to him in the hall, the cau&s;e of all our emotions&mdash;They had as much rea&s;on to blu&s;h, as I had.&mdash;Nancy, it &s;eems, even Nancy, &s;natched his hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it, in raptures. How dear is he to us all! He &s;ees it, now: There can be no re&s;erves to him, after this. Punctilio! <HI>Family Punctilio!</HI> men|tioned he in his Letter!&mdash;We have now no preten|&s;ions to it&mdash;</P>
<P>His eyes &s;hone with grateful &s;en&s;ibility. Look down upon me, lovelie&s;t of women, &s;aid he, with a bent knee; Look down upon me, and tell me, you forgive me, for my early return. But tho' returned, I am entirely at your devotion.</P>
<P>Lucy &s;ays, &s;he never &s;aw me more to my advan|tage. I looked down upon him, as he bid me, &s;miling through my tears. He &s;tole gently my handkerchief from my half-hid face; with it he dried my unaverted cheek, and put it, &s;he &s;ays, in his bo&s;om. I have lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>My uncle and aunt withdrew with him, and ac|quainted him with all particulars. To them he ac|knowleged, in words of eloquent Love, my uncle &s;aid, the honour done him by me, and by us all, in the
<PB N="263" REF="264">
demon&s;trations we had given of our tender regard for him.</P>
<P>I was, by the time of their return to us, pretty well recovered. Sir Charles approached me, without take|ing notice of the emotion I had been in. Mr. and Mrs. Selby tell me, &s;aid he, to me, that I am to be favoured with a re&s;idence at our venerable Mrs. Shir|ley's. This, tho' a high honour, looks a little di|&s;tant; &s;o would the next door, if it were not under the &s;ame roof with my Mi&s;s Byron: But, &s;miling tenderly upon me, I &s;hall pre&s;ume to hope, that this very di&s;tance will turn to my account. Mrs. Shirley's Harriet cannot decline paying her accu&s;tomed duty to the be&s;t of grandmothers.</P>
<P>Bowing, I &s;hall not, Sir, &s;aid I, be the more back|ward to pay my duty to my grandmamma, for your ob|liging her with your company.</P>
<P>Thus, re&s;umed he, &s;natching my hand, and ar|dently pre&s;&s;ing it with his lips, do I honour to my&s;elf for the honour done me. How poor is man! that he cannot expre&s;s his gratitude to the object of his vows, for obligations conferred, but by owning to her new ob|ligation!</P>
<P>Then turning round to my aunt&mdash;It is incumbent upon me, madam, &s;aid he, to pay my early devoirs to Mrs. Shirley, the <HI>ho&s;pitable</HI> Mrs. Shirley, repeated he, &s;miling; which looked as if he expected to be here. <HI>There,</HI> be&s;ides, (looking plea&s;antly upon my aunt) I may be a&s;ked&mdash;<HI>here</HI> I am not&mdash;to break my fa&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;et us all into motion. My uncle ran out to look after Sir Charles's &s;ervants, who, it &s;eems, in our hurry, were di&s;regarded: Their hor&s;es in the court-yard; three of them walking about, waiting their ma&s;ter's orders. My uncle was ready, in the true ta&s;te of old Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality, to <HI>pull</HI> them in.</P>
<P>Chocolate was in&s;tantly brought for their ma&s;ter; and a di&s;h for each of us. We had made but a poor
<PB N="264" REF="265">
breakfa&s;t, any of us. I could get nothing down before. My aunt put a &s;econd di&s;h into my hand: I took her kind meaning, and pre&s;ented it to Sir Charles. How gratefully did he receive it! Wiil it <HI>always</HI> be &s;o, Lady G.? My love, heightened by my duty, &s;hall not, when the obligation is doubled, make me le&s;s de&s;erving of his politene&s;s, if I can help it.</P>
<P>But &s;till this dreadful note, and Greville's reported moodine&s;s, made us unea&s;y. The &s;ervant we &s;ent re|turned, with information that Mr. Greville came home late la&s;t night. He was not &s;tirring, it &s;eems, tho' Eleven o'Clock, when the &s;ervant reached his hou&s;e. He is &s;aid to be not well; and, as one &s;ervant of his told ours, &s;o very fretful, and ill-tempered, that they none of them know how to &s;peak to him. God grant&mdash;But let me keep to my&s;elf &s;uch of my apprehen|&s;ions as are founded on conjecture&mdash;Why &s;hould I not hope the be&s;t? Is not your beloved brother at pre&s;ent &s;afe? And is he not the care of Providence?&mdash;I humbly tru&s;t he is.</P>
<P>Sir Charles took the note. I think I have &s;een the hand, &s;aid he: If I have, I &s;hall find out the writer. I dare &s;ay, it is written with a good intention.</P>
<P>My uncle and we all expre&s;&s;ed, &s;ome in words, &s;ome by looks, our apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>There cannot po&s;&s;ibly be room for any, &s;aid Sir Charles, always pre&s;ent to him&s;elf. Mr. Greville loves Mi&s;s Byron. It is no wonder, as his apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing all hopes of her for ever, grow &s;tronger, that he &s;hould be unea&s;y. He would make but an ill com|pliment to her merit, and his own &s;incerity, if he were not. But &s;uch a &s;take as he has in his country, he cannot have de&s;perate intentions. I remember, to his advantage, his la&s;t behavour here. I will make him a vi&s;it. I mu&s;t engage Mr. Greville to rank me in the number of his friends.</P>
<P>What he &s;aid gave us comfort. No wonder if we women love courage in a man: We <HI>ought,</HI> if it be true
<PB N="265" REF="266">
courage, like that of your excellent brother. After all, my dear, I think we mu&s;t allow a natural &s;uperio|rity in the minds of men over women. Do we not want protection? And does not that want imply infe|riority?&mdash;Yet if there be two &s;orts of courage, an <HI>acquired</HI> and a <HI>natural;</HI> why may not the former be obtained by women, as well as by men, were they to have the &s;ame education? NATURAL courage, may belong to either. Had Mi&s;s Barnevelt, for example, had a boy's education, &s;he would have probably chal|lenged her man, on provocation given; and he might have come off but poorly.</P>
<P>But we have more &s;illy antipathies than men, which help to keep us down: Whether tho&s;e may not &s;ome|times be owing to affectation, do you, Lady G. who, however, have as little affectation as ever woman had, determine. A frog, a toad, a &s;pider, a beetle, an earwig, will give us mighty pretty tender terror; while the heroic men will trample the in&s;ect under foot, and look the more brave for their barbarity, and for our <HI>delicate</HI> &s;creaming. But for an <HI>adventure,</HI> if a Lover get us into one, we frequently leave him a great way behind us. Don't you think &s;o, Lady G.?&mdash;Were not this Greville &s;till in my head, methinks I could be as pert as ever.</P>
<P>Sir Charles told us, that he &s;hould have been with us la&s;t night, but for a vi&s;it he was obliged to pay to Sir Harry Beauchamp; to make up for which hindrance, he took hor&s;e, and ordered his equipage to follow him.</P>
<P>He is gone to pay his duty, as he is plea&s;ed to call it, to my grandmamma, in my uncle's coach, my uncle with him. If they cannot prevail on my grand|mamma to come hither to dinner, and if &s;he is de|&s;irous Sir Charles &s;hould dine with her, he will oblige her&mdash;<HI>by my aunt's leave,</HI> was his addre&s;s to her. But perhaps &s;he will have the goodne&s;s to add her company to his, as &s;he knows <HI>that</HI> will give us all double plea|&s;ure:
<PB N="266" REF="267">
She loves to give plea&s;ure. Often does the dear Lady &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'How can pal&s;ied age, which is but a ter|rifying object to youth, expect the indulgence, the love, of the young and gay, if it does not &s;tudy to promote tho&s;e plea&s;ures which it&s;elf was fond of in youth? Enjoy innocently your &s;ea&s;on, girls, once &s;aid &s;he, &s;etting half a &s;core of us into country dances.

<P>MY uncle and Sir Charles came back to dinner; my grandmamma with them. She was &s;o good as to give me her company, at the fir&s;t word. Sir Charles, as we &s;at at dinner, and afterwards, &s;aw me weak in mind, ba&s;hful, and not quite recovered; and he &s;eemed to watch my uncle's eyes, and &s;o much di|verted him and all of us, that my uncle had not op|portunity to put forth, as u&s;ual. How did this kind protection a&s;&s;ure me! I thought my&s;elf quite well; and was &s;o chearfully &s;ilent when Sir Charles talked, that my grandmamma and aunt, who had placed me between them, whi&s;pered me &s;everally&mdash;You look charmingly ea&s;y, love&mdash;You look like your&s;elf, my dear. Yet &s;till this mi&s;chievous Greville ran in my head.</P>
<P>My uncle took notice, that Sir Charles had &s;aid, he gue&s;&s;ed at the writer of the note. He wi&s;hed he would give him an <HI>item,</HI> as he called it, whom he thought of.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve, Sir, an&s;wered Sir Charles, that the writer &s;ays, Mr. Greville was in wine. He profe&s;&s;es to be an encourager of the people of the George in Northampton. He often appoints company to meet him there. I imagine the writer to be the head waiter of the hou&s;e: The bills delivered me in, &s;eem to have been writen in &s;uch a hand as the note, as far as I can carry the hand writing in my eye.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268">
Ads-heart, &s;aid my uncle, that's undoubtedly right: Your name's up, Sir, I can tell you, among men, women, and children. This man, in his note, calls you (Look, el&s;e!) the mo&s;t generous and noble of men. He &s;ays, we <HI>&s;hall never know the writer!</HI>&mdash;Ads-dines! the man mu&s;t deal in art magic, that con|ceals him&s;elf from you, if you have a mind to find him out.</P>
<P>Well, but, &s;aid Lucy, if this be &s;o, I am concerned for the reality of the information. Such threatenings as Mr. Greville throws out, are not to be &s;lighted. Very true, &s;aid my uncle. Mr. Deane and I (Mr. Deane will certainly be here by-and-by) will go, and di&s;cour&s;e with Greville him&s;elf to-morrow, plea&s;e the Lord.</P>
<P>Sir Charles begged that this matter might be left to his management. Mr. Greville and I, &s;aid he, are upon &s;uch a foot, as, whether he be &s;o &s;incerely my friend as I am his, or not, will warrant a vi&s;it to him; and he cannot but take it as a civility, on my return into the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Should he be affronting, Sir Charles? Said my uncle&mdash;</P>
<P>I can have patience, if he &s;hould. He cannot be gro&s;ly &s;o.</P>
<P>I know not <HI>that,</HI> replied my uncle: Mr. Greville is a <HI>roi&s;ter!</HI></P>
<P>Well, dear Mr. Selby, leave this matter to me. <HI>Were</HI> there to be danger; the way to avoid it, is not to appear to be afraid of it. One man's fear gives another courage. I have no manner of doubt of being able to bring Mr. Greville with me to an amicable di&s;h of tea, or to dinner, which you plea&s;e, to-morrow.</P>
<P>Ads-heart, Sir, I wi&s;h not to &s;ee at <HI>either,</HI> the wretch who could threaten the life of a man &s;o dear to us all.</P>
<P>Sir Charles bowed to my uncle for his &s;incere com|pliment. I have nothing to do, &s;aid he, but to invite my&s;elf either to breakfa&s;t, or dine with <HI>him.</HI> His
<PB N="268" REF="269">
former &s;cheme of appearing to the world well with me, in order to &s;ave his &s;pirit, will be re&s;umed; and all will be right.</P>
<P>My aunt expre&s;&s;ed her fears, however, and looked at me, as I did at her, with a countenance, I &s;uppo&s;e, far from being unapprehen&s;ive: But Sir Charles &s;aid, You mu&s;t leave me, my dear friends, to my own methods; nor be anxious for my &s;afty. I am not a ra&s;h man: I can pity Mr. Greville; and the man I pity, cannot ea&s;ily provoke me.</P>
<P>We were all the ea&s;ier for what the charmingly-cool, becau&s;e truely brave, man &s;aid on a &s;ubject which has given us all &s;o much terror.</P>
<P>But was he not very good, my dear, not to &s;ay one word all this day of the important errand on which he came down? And to <HI>lead</HI> the &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation with de&s;ign, as my aunt and grandmamma both thought, as well as I, that my uncle &s;hould <HI>not?</HI> and to give me time to recover my &s;pirits? Yet when he did addre&s;s him&s;elf to me, never were tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect &s;o engagingly mingled. This my uncle ob&s;erved, as well as my aunt and Lucy. How the duce, &s;aid he, does this Sir Charles manage it? He has a way no man but him ever found out&mdash;He can court without &s;peech: He can take one's heart, and &s;ay never a word. Hay, Harriet! looking archly.</P>
<P>MR. Deane is come&mdash;In charming health and &s;pi|rits&mdash;Thank God! With what cordiality did Sir Charles and he embrace each other!</P>
<P>Sir Charles attended my grandmamma home: So we had not his company at &s;upper. Now convenience without its contrary. He is her own &s;on: She is his own parent. Such an unaffected love on both &s;ides!&mdash;Such a &s;weetly-ea&s;y, yet re&s;pectful, familiarity be|tween them! What additional plea&s;ures mu&s;t a young woman in my &s;ituation have, when &s;he can con&s;ider her&s;elf as the bond of union between the family &s;he
<PB N="269" REF="270">
is of, and that &s;he is entering into! How dreadful, on the contrary, mu&s;t be <HI>her</HI> ca&s;e, who is the occa&s;ion of propagating di&s;&s;ention, irreconcilable hatred, and abhorrence between her own relations and tho&s;e of the man to whom &s;he for life engages her&s;elf!</P>
<P>My grandmother and Sir Charles were no &s;ooner gone, than my uncle began to talk with Mr. Deane on the &s;ubject that is neare&s;t all our hearts. I was afraid the conver&s;ation would not be managed to my liking; and having too ju&s;t an excu&s;e to a&s;k leave to withdraw, from bad, or rather no re&s;t, la&s;t night, I made u&s;e of it; and here in my clo&s;et (preparing now, however, for it) am I</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day Morning, Nov. <HI>8.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SIR Charles let my grandmother come hither by her&s;elf. He is gone to vi&s;it that Greville. We are all in pain for him: But Mr. Deane comforts us.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, thus began my uncle upon me.</P>
<P>Here, Dame Selby, are we &s;till <HI>at a fault.</HI> Har|riet knows not what &s;he would be at; and you uphold her in her <HI>non&s;en&s;es.</HI> Delicacy! Delicacy! The duce take me, if I have any notion of it!&mdash;What a <HI>pize</HI> are you about?</P>
<P>Dear Sir! why am I blamed? &s;aid I. What would you have me do, that I have <HI>not</HI> done?</P>
<P><HI>Do!</HI> why I would have you give him his Day, and keep to it; <HI>that</HI> I would have you do: And not &s;hilly|&s;hally for ever&mdash;and &s;ubject the be&s;t of men to in&s;ults. All your men will be ea&s;y and quiet, when the cere|mony is over, and they know there is no remedy.</P>
<P>My good Mr. Selby, &s;aid my grandmamma, you
<PB N="270" REF="271">
now blame without rea&s;on. Sir Charles was full ha&s;ty. Harriet was a little more nice, perhaps, her Lover con&s;idered, than &s;he needed to be. Yet I don't know, but I, in her ca&s;e, &s;hould have done as &s;he did; and expected as much time as &s;he was willing to take. It was not a <HI>very</HI> long one, Mr. Selby, from the decla|ration he made; and he is a man him&s;elf of great de|licacy. Harriet very readily acknowleged to him the preference &s;he gave him to all them; and when &s;he found him very earne&s;t for a &s;hort day, &s;he, by her la&s;t Letter, threw her&s;elf generou&s;ly into his power. He is full of acknowlegements upon it; and &s;o he ought to be. To me he has &s;aid all that a man &s;hould &s;ay of his gratitude, upon the occa&s;ion; and he de|clared to me la&s;t night, that it was with difficulty he forbore taking advantage of her goodne&s;s to him: But that he checked him&s;elf, and led to other &s;ubjects, &s;eeing how much the dear creature was di&s;ordered, and being apprehen&s;ive, that if he had begun upon one &s;o intere&s;ting, or even wi&s;hed to talk with her alone, he &s;hould have increa&s;ed her di&s;order.</P>
<P>Oy, Oy! Sir Charles is con&s;iderate; and Harriet &s;hould be grateful: But indeed my Dame Selby is as &s;illy, to the full, as Harriet. She is for having Har|riet keep <HI>her</HI> in countenance in the dance &s;he led me, &s;o many years ago&mdash;Lady G. for my money. She finds you all out in your Ma&s;onry.</P>
<P>Mr. Selby, &s;aid my aunt, I only refer my&s;elf to what our venerable parent ju&s;t &s;aid.</P>
<P>And &s;o don't think it worth while to hold an argu|ment with me, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
<P>I did not know, my dear, that you wanted to hold an argument.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, madam&mdash;with that &s;ly leer&mdash;<HI>So</HI> like Harriet! and Harriet <HI>&s;o</HI> like you!</P>
<P>But, Mr. Selby, &s;aid my grandmamma, will you be plea&s;ed to tell the dear child, if you think her wrong, what is the next &s;tep &s;he &s;hould take?</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="272">
Think her wrong!&mdash;Next &s;tep!&mdash;Why the next &s;tep is, as &s;he has promi&s;ed to oblige him, and to be directed by him, to keep her word; and not <HI>hum</HI> nor <HI>haw</HI> about the matter.</P>
<P>Mr. Deane, who had been &s;hewn and told every|thing that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince we &s;aw him la&s;t, &s;aid, You don't <HI>know</HI> that my daughter Byron will make unne|ce&s;&s;ary parade, Mr. Selby. Sir Charles you find, in tenderne&s;s to her, a&s;ked no que&s;tions ye&s;terday; made no claim&mdash;<HI>She</HI> could not begin the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid Lucy, I cannot but &s;ay, that my cou&s;in is in &s;ome fault.</P>
<P>Look you there, now! &s;aid my uncle.</P>
<P>We all &s;tared at Lucy; for &s;he &s;poke and looked very &s;eriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Might &s;he not have &s;aid, proceeded &s;he, when Sir Charles &s;urprized her at his fir&s;t arrival (what tho' her heart was divided between pa&s;t terror, and pre&s;ent joy?) Here I am, Sir, at your &s;ervice: Are you prepared for to-morrow?&mdash;And then made him one of her be&s;t courte&s;ies.</P>
<P>Sauce-box!&mdash;Well, well, I believe I have been a little ha&s;ty in my judgment (rapping under the table with his knuckles): But I am &s;o afraid that &s;omething will happen between the cup and the lip&mdash;Here, la&s;t night, I dreamt that Lady Clementina and he were going to be married&mdash;Give me your hand, my dear Harriet, and don't revoke the <HI>kindne&s;s</HI> in your la&s;t Letter to him, but whatever be the day he propo&s;es, comply; and you will win my heart for ever.</P>
<P>As Sir Charles <HI>leads,</HI> Harriet mu&s;t <HI>follow,</HI> re&s;umed my grandmamma. You men are &s;ad pre&s;cribers in the&s;e delicate ca&s;es, Mr. Selby. You will be put to it, my dear love, taking my hand, before this day is over, now you &s;eem &s;o purely recovered. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is not a dreaming Lover. Prepare your mind, my child: You'll be put to it, I do a&s;&s;ure you.</P>

Why, oy; I can't but &s;ay, Sir Charles is a man&mdash;Don't you, my <HI>lovely Love,</HI> be too much a woman!&mdash;Too clo&s;e a copier of your aunt Selby here!&mdash;and, as I &s;aid, you will have my heart for ever&mdash;Oy, and Sir Charles's too; for he is not one of your &s;orry fellows that can't di&s;tingui&s;h between a favour and a folly.</P>
<P>My uncle then went out with a flouri&s;h, and took Mr. Deane with him; leaving only my grandmamma, my aunt, my Lucy, and your Harriet, together.</P>
<P>We had a good deal of talk upon the important &s;ubject. The conclu&s;ion was, that I would refer Sir Charles to my grandmamma, if he were urgent for the day, and &s;he was ve&s;ted with a di&s;cretionary power to determine for her girl.</P>
<P>Such of my cloaths, then, as were near fini&s;hed, were ordered to be produced, with &s;ome of the nup|tial ornaments. They were all to &s;it in judgment upon them.</P>
<P>Surely, Lady G. the&s;e are &s;olemn circum&s;tances, lightly as my uncle thinks of them. Mu&s;t not every thoughtful young creature, on &s;o great a change, and for life, have conflicts in her mind, be her pro&s;pects ever &s;o happy, as the day approaches? Of what ma|terials mu&s;t the hearts of runaways, and of fugitives, to men half-&s;trangers to them, be compounded?</P>
<P>My aunt has ju&s;t left with me the following Billet, from Sir Charles, directed to my uncle, from Mr. Greville's:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. <HI>Selby,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Regret every moment that I pa&s;s out of Selby-hou&s;e, or Shirley-manor: And as I have &s;o few particular friends in the&s;e parts out of your family, I think I ought to account to you for the hours I do: Nor will I, now our friend&s;hip is &s;o unalterably fixed and acknowleged, apologize for giving my&s;elf, by this means, the con&s;equence with your family, that every one of yours, for their &s;ingle &s;akes, are of to me,
<PB N="273" REF="274">
&s;uperadded to the tendere&s;t attachments to one dear per&s;on of it.</P>
<P>I found the gentleman in a le&s;s happy di&s;po&s;ition than I expected.</P>
<P>It is with inexpre&s;&s;ible reluctance that he thinks, as my happy day draws near, of giving up all hopes of an object &s;o dear to him. He &s;eemed &s;trangely ba|lancing on this &s;ubject, when I was introduced to him. He in&s;tantly propo&s;ed to me, and with &s;ome fiercene&s;s, that I would &s;u&s;pend all thoughts of marriage for <HI>two</HI> months to come, or at lea&s;t for <HI>one.</HI> I received his reque&s;t with proper indignation. He pretended to give rea&s;ons re&s;pecting him&s;elf: I allowed not of them.</P>
<P>After &s;ome canva&s;&s;ings, he &s;wore, that he would be complied with in <HI>&s;omething.</HI> His alternative was, the dining with him, and with &s;ome of his cho&s;en friends, whom he had invited.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to think the&s;e friends are tho&s;e to whom he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with violence at the George, as overheard, I &s;uppo&s;e, by the waiter there.</P>
<P>He rode out, he owned, ye&s;terday morning, with intent to meet me; for he boa&s;ts that he knows all my motions, and tho&s;e of a certain beloved young Lady. Let him; let every-body, who think it their concern to watch our &s;teps, be made acquainted with them: The hone&s;t heart aims not at &s;ecrets. I &s;hould glory in receiving Mi&s;s Byron's hand, from yours, Sir, before ten thou&s;and witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville had rode out the night before; he did not &s;ay to meet me; but he knew I was expected at Selby-hou&s;e, either on Monday night, or ye&s;terday morning: And on his return, not meeting me, he and his friends pa&s;&s;ed their night at the George, as men|tioned, and rode out together in the morning&mdash;In hopes of meeting me, he &s;aid; and to engage me to &s;u&s;pend my happy day. Poor man! Had he been in his <HI>right mind,</HI> he could not have hoped (had he met
<PB N="274" REF="275">
me on the road) to have been <HI>heard</HI> on &s;uch a &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>An act of oblivion, and thorough reconciliation, he calls it, is to pa&s;s, in pre&s;ence of his expected friends.</P>
<P>You will not take notice of what I have hinted at, out of the family, whatever was de&s;igned.</P>
<P>In the temper he would have found me in, had he met me, nothing unhappy could have happened; for he is really to be pitied.</P>
<P>We are now perfect friends. He is full of good wi&s;hes. He talks of a vi&s;it to Lady Frampton, of a month. I write thus particularly, that I may not al|low &s;uch a &s;ubject as this to interfere with that delight|ful one which engro&s;&s;es my whole attention; and which I hope, in the evening, will be honoured with the attention of the beloved and admired of every heart, as well as of that of</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Poor wicked Greville&mdash;May he go to Lady Frampton's, or where-ever el&s;e, &s;o it be fifty miles di&s;tant from us. I &s;hall be afraid of him, till I hear he has quitted, for a time, his &s;eat in this neighbour|hood.</P>
<P>What a glorious quality is courage, when it is di|ve&s;ted of ra&s;hne&s;s! When it is founded on integrity of heart, and innocence of life and manners! But, otherwi&s;e founded, Is it not rather to be called <HI>&s;avage|ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>brutality?</HI></P>
<P>How much trouble have I given your brother! What dangers have I involved him in! It cannot be po&s;&s;ible for me evre to reward him.&mdash;But the proud|e&s;t heart may deem it a glory to owe obligation to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>

<P>SIR Charles broke away, and came hither by our tea-time. I was in my clo&s;et writing. They all crouded about him. He avoided particulars: Only &s;aid, that all was friend&s;hip between Mr. Greville and him&s;elf; and that Mr. Greville came with him part of the way; full of his re&s;umed &s;cheme, of appearing to be upon a good under&s;tanding with him, and a friend to the alliance between him and us.</P>
<P>Sir Charles looked about him, as if for &s;omebody he &s;aw not. My aunt came up to me: My dear, do you know who is come? She then told me the above particulars. We had a &s;ummons to tea. Down we ha&s;tened. He met us both at the parlour-door. O madam, &s;aid he, what precious hours have I lo&s;t!&mdash;I have been patience it&s;elf!</P>
<P>I congratulated him on what my aunt had told me. I found he intended, as he &s;ays in his Billet, that the particulars he gave in it &s;hould an&s;wer our curio&s;ity; and to have done with the &s;ubject. What a charming po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf, that he could be in &s;uch a brangle, as I may call it, and which might have had fatal con&s;equences; yet to be &s;o wholly, and &s;o &s;oon, dive&s;ted of the &s;ubject; and &s;o infinitely agreeable upon half a &s;core others, as they offered from one or other as we &s;at at tea!</P>
<P>Tea was no &s;ooner over, but he &s;ingled me out&mdash;May I, madam, beg the favour of a half-hour's au|dience?</P>
<P>Sir, Sir! he&s;itated the &s;impleton, and was going to betray my expectation, by expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome little re|luctance; but, recollecting my&s;elf, I &s;uffered him to lead me into the Cedar parlour. When there, &s;eating
<PB N="276" REF="277">
me&mdash;Now, madam, let me again thank you, a thou|&s;and and a thou&s;and times, for the honour of your la&s;t conde&s;cending Letter.</P>
<P>He but ju&s;t touched my hand, and appeared &s;o <HI>en|couragingly</HI> re&s;pectful!&mdash;I mu&s;t have loved him then, if I had not before.</P>
<P>You have, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, a man before you, that never can be ungrateful. Believe me, my deare&s;t Life, tho' I have urged you as I have, you are ab&s;olutely your own mi&s;tre&s;s of the day, and of every day of my life, as far as it &s;hall be in my power to make you &s;o. You part with power, my lovely Mi&s;s Byron, but to find it with an increa&s;e. Only let me be&s;eech you, now I have given it you back again, not to permit your heart to be &s;wayed by <HI>mere</HI> motives of punctilio.</P>
<P>A charming glow had over&s;pread his cheek; and he looked as when I beheld him in his &s;i&s;ter's dre&s;&s;ing|room, after he had re&s;cued me from the hands of the then cruel, now mortified, Sir Hargrave Pollexfen.</P>
<P>Punctilio, <HI>mere</HI> punctilio, Sir, &s;hall <HI>not</HI> weigh with me. What I wrote to you, I intend to comply with. My heart, Sir, is&mdash;<HI>Yours!</HI>&mdash;I would have &s;aid&mdash;Why would not my tongue &s;peak it?&mdash;My, my, I &s;tam|mered&mdash;Why did I &s;tammer?&mdash;Had I not owned it <HI>before</HI> to be &s;o?&mdash;My grandmamma, Sir, and aunt&mdash;I could not at that in&s;tant, for my life, &s;ay another word.</P>
<P>Sweet confu&s;ion! I urge you no more on this topic, ju&s;t now: I joyfully take your reference. Then drawing a chair next me, he ki&s;&s;ed his own hand, and held it out, as it were, courting mine. I yielded it to him, as by an involuntary motion&mdash;yet my heart was forwarder than my hand. He tenderly gra&s;ped it&mdash;retaining it&mdash;and in&s;tead of urging the approaching day, talked to me as if it were pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I have a reque&s;t to make to your grandmother, your uncle and aunt, your Lucy, and our Mr. Deane; it
<PB N="277" REF="278">
is a very bold one: That when I have been ble&s;&s;ed with your hand, they will be &s;o good as to accompany their beloved Harriet, then no more Byron, but Gran|di&s;on, to my family-&s;eat, and &s;ee the beloved of every heart happily fixed, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The hou&s;e is venerable (I will not call it old); but large and convenient. Compa&s;&s;ion for your neighbouring admirers, will induce you to &s;upport me in this reque&s;t. You cannot bear, I imagine, without a le&s;&s;ening of your own joy (if I prove the ju&s;t, the grateful man to you, that, if I know my&s;elf, I &s;hall be) either to &s;ee at church, or in your vi&s;its, tho&s;e men who preferred you to all women; or, if they forbear the one or the other, to account with a gentle &s;igh for their forbear|ance. Other women might triumph &s;ecretly on &s;uch occa&s;ions; but I, even I, the &s;ucce&s;sful, the di&s;tin|gui&s;hed man, &s;hall not forbear &s;ome inward pity for them. Now, madam, an excur&s;ion of a month or two, if no more, made by tho&s;e dear friends, who otherwi&s;e will be loth, &s;o &s;oon as I wi&s;h, to part with you; will <HI>wean,</HI> as I may &s;ay, the&s;e unhappy men from you. Mr. Orme, Mr. Greville, will not then be obliged to quit their own hou&s;es, and this neigh|bourhood. I &s;hall not, whenever I &s;tep into com|pany, &s;ee dejected men, who&s;e dejection is owing, as they will think, to my happine&s;s: All your <HI>new</HI> rela|tions will attend you, in turn, in the hou&s;e that I al|ways loved, and wi&s;hed to &s;ettle in; your own rela|tions with you, and witne&s;&s;es of our mutual happi|ne&s;s&mdash;Support me, generou&s;ly &s;upport me, in this pro|po&s;al, when I &s;hall be intitled, by your goodne&s;s, to make it.&mdash;Silent, my deare&s;t Love!&mdash;If I have been too early in thus opening my heart to you, do me the ju&s;tice to &s;uppo&s;e that it is owing to my wi&s;hes to pa&s;s over another intere&s;ting &s;ubject which mu&s;t take place before my propo&s;al can; and which, however, en|gages my whole heart.</P>
<P>I might well be &s;ilent: I could not find utterance
<PB N="278" REF="279">
for the emotions of my heart. I withdrew my hand to take my handkerchief (You have often told me, Lady G. that I was born in an April morning); but putting it into my other hand, I gratefully (I hope not too fondly) laid it in his way to take it again. He did, with an air that had both veneration and gratitude in it&mdash;My deare&s;t Life, tenderly gra&s;ping it&mdash;how amiable this goodne&s;s!&mdash;You are not, I &s;ee, di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Di&s;plea&s;ed!&mdash;O, Sir Charles!&mdash;But, alas! while I am too-too happy, the exalted Lady abroad!&mdash;She, &s;he, only! Your friend Jeronymo's la&s;t Letter&mdash;</P>
<P>Thus brokenly did I expre&s;s (what my heart was full of) her worthine&s;s, my inferiority.</P>
<P>Exalted creature!&mdash;Angelic goodne&s;s! You are Clementina and Harriet, both in one: One mind cer|tainly informs you both.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in my aunt Selby. I have, madam, &s;aid he to her, been making a reque&s;t to your beloved niece: I am exceedingly earne&s;t in it. She will be &s;o good as to break it to you; and I hope&mdash;</P>
<P>O Sir! interrupted my too eager aunt, &s;uppo&s;ing it had been for the Day, Mrs. Shirley has the power&mdash;</P>
<P>My dear aunt Selby! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>What have I &s;aid, Love?&mdash;</P>
<P>He caught eagerly at it&mdash;Happy mi&s;take! &s;aid he. My dear Mrs. Selby, I thank you!</P>
<P>He bowed, ki&s;&s;ed my hand, and left me to go to my grandmamma, to inform him&s;elf of what he had to hope for, as to the Day, from her.</P>
<P>I told my aunt what the reque&s;t was, and what a conver&s;ation we had had: And what, madam, &s;aid I, have you done!</P>
<P>My aunt approved of his propo&s;al. It will be the pride of your uncle's heart and mine, to &s;ee you &s;ettled in Grandi&s;on-hall.</P>
<P>What &s;hort work did my grandmamma make of it! In le&s;s than a quarter of an hour Sir Charles returned, overjoyed, with an open Billet in his hand, from the venerable parent. This is it:</P>

<P>Had you &s;een, my dear Charlotte, with what ten|der re&s;pect your brother approached me, and with what an inimitable grace he offered me the open Billet, how would you have been charmed with him! The excellent Mrs. Shirley, &s;aid he, would not permit me to bring this ine&s;timable paper folded. I have con|templated the propitious lines all the way. On my knee let me thank you, my dear Mi&s;s Byron, for your acquie&s;cence with her determination. He ki&s;&s;ed my hand on one knee.</P>
<P>He &s;aw me di&s;turbed [Could I help it? There is &s;omething awful in the fixing of the <HI>very</HI> Day, Lady G. but I tried to recover my&s;elf. I would fain avoid appearing guilty of affection in his eyes]. I will not add a word more, my Angel &s;aid he, on the joy|ful &s;ubject. Only tell me, Shall we ha&s;ten to attend the conde&s;cending parent?</P>
<P>My duty to <HI>her,</HI> Sir, &s;aid I (but with more he&s;i|tation than I wi&s;hed) &s;hall be an earne&s;t of that which I am &s;o &s;oon, &s;o <HI>very</HI> &s;oon, to vow to <HI>you:</HI> And I gave him my hand.</P>
<P>There is no de&s;cribing to you, my dear Lady G. the looks, the manner, with which it was received, by the mo&s;t ardent, and yet mo&s;t re&s;pectful, of Lovers.</P>
<P>I had &s;care approaced my grandmamma, and be|gun to utter &s;omething of the <HI>much</HI> my heart was filled with, when my Uncle and Mr. Deane (by mi&s;take, I believe) were admitted.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="281">
Well, let us know every-thing about it, &s;aid my uncle&mdash;I hope Sir Charles is plea&s;ed. I hope&mdash;</P>
<P>The Day was named to him.</P>
<P>Well, well, thank God! And he &s;poke in an ac|cent that expre&s;&s;ed his joy.</P>
<P>Your niece has plea&s;ed you now, I hope, Mr. Selby, &s;aid my grandmamma.</P>
<P>Pretty well! pretty well! God grant that we meet with no <HI>Put-offs!</HI> I hardly longed &s;o much for my own Day with my Dame Selby there, as I have done, and do, to &s;ee my Harriet Lady Grandi&s;on&mdash;God, God, ble&s;s you, my deare&s;t love! and ki&s;&s;ed my cheek&mdash;You have been very, <HI>very</HI> good, in the main&mdash;And, but for Dame Selby, would have been better, as far as I know.</P>
<P>You don't do me ju&s;tice, my dear, replied my aunt.</P>
<P>Don't I?&mdash;Nor did I ever&mdash;taking kindly her hand&mdash;It was impo&s;&s;ible, my dear Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, for &s;uch a man as I to do ju&s;tice to this excellent wo|man. <HI>You</HI> never, Sir, will be &s;o <HI>froppi&s;h</HI> as I have been: It was in my nature: I could not help it: But I was always &s;orry for it <HI>afterwards.</HI>&mdash;But if Harriet make you no wor&s;e a wife than my Dame Selby has made me, you will not be unhappy&mdash;And yet I was led a tedious dance after her, before I knew what &s;he would be at&mdash;I had like to have forgot that. But one thing I have to reque&s;t, proceeded my uncle&mdash;Mr. Deane and I have been talking of it&mdash;God ble&s;s your dear &s;ouls, all of you, oblige me&mdash;It is, That we may have a joyful Day of it; and that all our neighbours and tenants may rejoice with us. I mu&s;t make the village &s;moke. No <HI>hugger-mugger</HI> doings&mdash;Let pri|vate weddings be for doubtful <HI>happine&s;s</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>O my uncle! &s;aid I&mdash;</P>
<P>And O my niece, too! I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have it &s;o. Sir Charles, what &s;ay <HI>you?</HI> Are you for chamber-mar|riages?&mdash;I <HI>&s;ay,</HI> that &s;uch are neither <HI>decent,</HI> nor <HI>godly.</HI> 
<PB N="281" REF="282">
But you would not allow Lady G. to come off &s;o&mdash;And in your <HI>own</HI> ca&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>Am for doing as in Lady G's. I mu&s;t hope to pay my vows at the Altar to this excellent Lady. What &s;ays my Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P>I, Sir, hope to return mine in the &s;ame &s;acred place (my face, as I felt, in a glow); but yet I &s;hall wi&s;h to have it as private as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Why, oy, to be &s;ure&mdash;When a woman is to do any|thing &s;he is a&s;hamed of&mdash;I think &s;he is right to be pri|vate, for <HI>example</HI> -&s;ake. Shall <HI>you</HI> be a&s;hamed, Sir Charles?</P>
<P>Sir Charles has given it under his hand, this very day, &s;aid Lucy, interrupting him, as he was going to &s;peak, that he &s;hall glory in receiving my cou&s;in's hand before ten thou&s;and witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Make but my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron ea&s;y on this head, &s;aid Sir Charles (That ta&s;k, Ladies, be yours); and, &s;o the Church be the place, I &s;hall be happy in the manner.</P>
<P>The ceremony, &s;aid my grandmamma, <HI>cannot</HI> be a private one with us: Every-body's eyes are upon us. It would be an affectation in us, that would rather rai&s;e, than allay, curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>And I have as good as promi&s;ed the two pretty Nedhams, &s;aid my uncle&mdash;and Mi&s;s Wat&s;on and her cou&s;in are in expectation.</P>
<P>O my uncle!</P>
<P>Dear Harriet, forgive me! The&s;e are your compa|nions from childhood! You can treat them but once in your life in this way. They would be glad at heart to return the favour.</P>
<P>I withdrew: Lucy followed me&mdash;<HI>You,</HI> Lucy, I &s;ee, &s;aid I, are for the&s;e public doings&mdash;But you would not, if it were your own ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Your</HI> ca&s;e is <HI>my</HI> ca&s;e, Harriet. I &s;hould hardly bear being made a &s;hew of with any other man: But with &s;uch a man as yours, if I did not <HI>hold up my head,</HI> I

&s;hould give leer for &s;tare, to &s;ee how envy &s;at upon the womens faces. <HI>You</HI> may leer at the <HI>men</HI> for the &s;ame rea&s;on. It will be a wicked day after all, Har|riet; for a general envy will po&s;&s;e&s;s the hearts of all beholders.</P>
<P>Lucy, you know, my dear Lady G. is a whim&s;ical girl.</P>
<P>So, my dear, the &s;olemn Day is fixed. If you could favour me with your &s;upporting pre&s;ence&mdash;I know, if you come, you will be very good, now I have not, as I hope you will think, been guilty, of much, no not of any, parade&mdash;Lucy will write Let|ters for me to Lady D. to my cou&s;in Reeves's, and will undertake all matters of ceremony for her Har|riet. May I but have the happine&s;s to know that Lady Clementina&mdash;What <HI>can</HI> I wi&s;h for Lady Cle|mentina?&mdash;But &s;hould &s;he be unhappy&mdash;that would be an abatement of my felicity indeed!</P>
<P>There is no &s;uch thing as thinking of the dear Emily. What a happine&s;s, could I have &s;een Lady L. here!&mdash;But that cannot be! May the Day that will in its <HI>anniver&s;ary</HI> be the happie&s;t of <HI>my</HI> life, give to <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Lady L.</HI> their mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;hes!</P>
<P>Sir Charles di&s;patches Frederick to-morrow to town with Letters: He will bring you mine. I would not go to re&s;t till I had fini&s;hed it.</P>
<P>What have I more to &s;ay?&mdash;I &s;eem to have a great deal. My head and my heart are full: Yet it is time to draw to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let me, my deare&s;t Lady G. know, if I am to have any hopes of your pre&s;ence? Will you be &s;o good as to manage with Emily?</P>
<P>My aunt bids me &s;uppo&s;e to you, that &s;ince we are to have all the world of <HI>our</HI> acquaintance, you &s;hould bring down your aunt Grandi&s;on with you.&mdash;We have at both hou&s;es a great deal of room.</P>

pre&s;ent, if every one's dear Dr. Bartlett were to per|form the ceremony? My grandmamma an&s;wered, That Dr. Curtis was one of my admiring friends.

I &s;hall reckon with you &s;oon for one of them, in which you take intolerable liberties with me. O Harriet! tremble at my re&s;entment. You are downright &s;currilous, my dear.</P>
<P>I imputed extravagance to Emily, in my la&s;t. The girl's a good girl. I was too ha&s;ty. I will &s;hew you two Letters of hers, and one of my brother, which clears up the imputation. I love her more and more. Poor girl! Love peeps out in twenty places of hers: In his, he is the be&s;t of men: But that you knew before.</P>
<P>And &s;o the hone&s;t man ki&s;&s;ed you; ki&s;&s;ed your lip!
<PB N="284" REF="285">
O Lud! O Lud! how could you bear him afterwards in your &s;ight?&mdash;Forgiving creature!&mdash;And &s;o you were friends with him before you had time to &s;hew your anger.&mdash;Nothing like doing impudent things in a hurry.&mdash;Sometimes re&s;pectful, &s;ometimes free: Why this is the way of all the fellows, Harriet!&mdash;And &s;o they go on till the re&s;pectfulne&s;s is drawn off, and nothing but the lees are left; and after two or three months are over, the once &s;queami&s;h palate will be glad of <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>I like your uncle better than I like either your aunt or you&mdash;He likes me.</P>
<P>What a mi&s;erable dog (Take the word for &s;hortne&s;s, I am in ha&s;te) is Sir Hargrave!</P>
<P>Your plea again&s;t Clementina being <HI>compelled,</HI> or <HI>over</HI> -per&s;uaded (the &s;ame thing) I much like. You are a good girl.</P>
<P>Betwixt her excellencies and yours, how mu&s;t my brother's &s;oul be divided!&mdash;I wonder he thinks of either of you. A&s;s and two bundles of hay, Harriet. But my brother is a nobler animal: He won't &s;tarve. But I think, in my con&s;cience, he &s;hould have you both. There might be a law made, that the ca&s;e &s;hould not be brought into precedent till two &s;uch wo|men &s;hould be found, and &s;uch a man; and all three in the like &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Bagenhall! a mi&s;erable devil! Excellent warning-pieces!</P>
<P>Wicked Harriet! You infected me with your hor|rible inferences from Greville's temper, threatenings, and-&s;o-forth. The conclu&s;ion of this Letter left me a wretch!&mdash;If the&s;e megrims are the effect of Love, thank Heaven, I never knew what it was.&mdash;<HI>Sufficient to the day,</HI> and-&s;o-forth.</P>
<P>Devili&s;h girl! to torment me with your dreams! If you ever tell me of any more of them, except they are of a different &s;ort, woe be to you!</P>
<P>I like your parting &s;eene, and all that. Your
<PB N="285" REF="286">
<HI>realities,</HI> thank Heaven, are more delightful than your <HI>re&s;veries.</HI> I hope you'll always find them &s;o.</P>
<P>And &s;o you were full of apprehen&s;ions on the favour your aunt did me in employing me about your <HI>nuptial equipments.</HI> Long ago <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'you gave affectation to the winds.'</Q> Good! But the winds would not accept of your pre&s;ent. They puffed it you back again, and your &s;ervants never told you it was brought home. I repeat, my dear, that my brother is much more clever, in the&s;e &s;cenes of Love and Court&s;hip, than his mi&s;|tre&s;s. You are a pretty cow, my Love: You give good &s;tore of milk, but you have a very carele&s;s heel. Yet when you <HI>bethink</HI> you, you are very good; but not always the &s;ame Harriet. Your nur&s;e in your in|fancy, <HI>&s;ee-&s;awed</HI> you&mdash;<HI>Margery-dawn</HI>&mdash;and you can't put the pretty play out of your practice, tho' it is out of your memory. I can look back, and &s;ometimes by your frowardne&s;s, &s;ometimes by your crowing, know how it was with you eighteen years ago.</P>
<P>My brother's Letter to you, after he has mentioned his vi&s;its to the two &s;ick Baronets, is that of a man who &s;hews you genteelly, and politely, that he is &s;en&s;ible he has a pretty trifler to deal with. I wi&s;h you would &s;quare your conduct, by what you mu&s;t imagine a man of his &s;en&s;e would think of you. I &s;hould be too proud a minx, in your ca&s;e, to owe obligation to my man for bearing with me&mdash;Spare me, &s;pare me, Har|riet! I have hit my&s;elf a terrible box o' the ear. But we can find faults in others, which we will not allow to be &s;uch in our&s;elves&mdash;But here is the difference be|tween your conduct now, and what mine was. I <HI>knew</HI> I was wrong, and re&s;olved one day to amend. You think your&s;elf right, and, while you &s;o think, will hardly ever mend, till your man ties you down to good behaviour.</P>
<P>Jeronymo's Letter! O the next to divine Clemen|tina! Indeed, Harriet, I think &s;he out-&s;oars you. I adore her. But will &s;he be prevailed upon to marry?&mdash;
<PB N="286" REF="287">
She will!&mdash;If &s;he does&mdash;Then&mdash;But, dear Soul!&mdash;Pre&s;&s;ed as &s;he is&mdash;Having refu&s;ed, in&s;tead of being re|fu&s;ed, the beloved of her heart, &s;he will &s;till be greater than any of her Sex, if &s;he does; the man propo&s;ed, &s;o unexceptionable; &s;o tenderly loving her, in the height of her calamity, as well as in her pro&s;perity!&mdash;Gratitude to him, as well as Duty to her parents; parents &s;o indulgent as they have always been to her; will incline her to marry. May &s;he be happy! I am plea&s;ed with your &s;olicitude for her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I like your an&s;wer to my brother: A good and well|de&s;erved re&s;ignation. Let's &s;ee how you keep to it.</P>
<P>You do keep to it&mdash;<HI>as I expected</HI>&mdash;Ah, Harriet! you are quite a girl, &s;ometimes; tho', at others, more than woman! <Q REND="inline">'Will he not a&s;k leave to come down?'</Q> Fine re&s;ignation!&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Will he not write, fir&s;t?'</Q>&mdash;Yes, yes, <HI>he</HI> will do every-thing he ought to do. Look to your own behaviour, child; don't fear but <HI>his</HI> will be all as it &s;hould be. As to your finery, how now, Harriet! Are <HI>you</HI> to direct every-thing; yet pretend to a&s;k advice? Be contented that every-thing is <HI>done for you</HI> of this &s;ort, and learn to be humble. Sure we that have pa&s;&s;ed the Rubicon, are not to be directed by you, who never came in &s;ight of the river. But you, maid|ens, are poor, proud, pragmatical mortals. You pro|fe&s;s ignorance; but in <HI>heart</HI> imagine you are at the tip-top of your wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>But here you come with your horrid fears again. Would to the Lord the Day were over; and you and my brother <HI>were</HI>&mdash;Upon my life&mdash;you are a&mdash;But I won't call you names.</P>
<P>Lucy thinks you &s;hould go to Shirley-manor when my brother comes down. Egregious folly! I did not think Lucy could have been &s;o &s;illy.</P>
<P>Concerning our cou&s;in Reeves's wanting to be pre|&s;ent at your nuptials&mdash;your invitation to me&mdash;and what you &s;ay of Emily&mdash;more anon.</P>
<P>Well, and &s;o my brother has &s;ent you the expected
<PB N="287" REF="288">
Letter. Does it plea&s;e you, Harriet? The duce is in you, if it don't.</P>
<P>But you are <HI>not</HI> plea&s;ed with it, it &s;eems. He is too ha&s;ty for you. Where's the boa&s;ted-of re&s;ignation, Harriet? True <HI>Female</HI> re&s;ignation!</P>
<P>Tell Lucy, I am obliged to her, for her tran&s;crip|tions. I &s;hall be very proud of her corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>'Your <HI>aunt</HI> thinks he is full ha&s;ty.'&mdash;Your aunt's a &s;impleton, as well as you. My &s;ervice to her.</P>
<P>But is the D&mdash;I in the girl again? What would have become of Lady L. and me, had you not &s;ent both Letters together that relate to Greville's &s;uppo&s;ed malignance? I tremble, neverthele&s;s, at the thought of what might have been. But I will not forgive Lucy for advi&s;ing you to &s;end to us your horribly-painted terrors. What could po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>her</HI> to advi&s;e you to do &s;o, and <HI>you,</HI> to follow her advice? I forgive not either of you. In revenge I will remind you, that you are one of the <HI>good women</HI> to whom he owes all the embarra&s;ments of his pa&s;t life.</P>
<P>But a caution, Harriet!&mdash;Never, never, let fooli&s;h dreams claim a moment of your attention&mdash;Immi|nent as &s;eemed the danger, your &s;uper&s;tition made more dreadful to you than otherwi&s;e it would have been. You have a mind &s;uperior to &s;uch foibles: Act up to its native dignity, and let not the follies of your nur&s;es, in your infantile &s;tate, be carried into your ma|turer age, to depreciate your womanly rea&s;on. Do you think I don't dream, as well as you?</P>
<P>Well might ye all rejoice in his &s;afety. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Hang about his neck, for joy!'</Q> So you ought, if you thought it would do him honour. Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, proud girl! don't &s;cold me! I think, were a king your man, he would have been honoured by the charming free|dom. <Q REND="inline">'Ca&s;t him&s;elf at your feet!'</Q> And you ought to have ca&s;t your&s;elf at his. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'There can be no re|&s;erve to him after this,'</Q> you &s;ay. Nor ought there, had it not been for this. Did you not &s;ignify to him,
<PB N="288" REF="289">
by Letter, that you would re&s;ign to his genero&s;ity? Let me whi&s;per you, Harriet&mdash;Sure you proud maiden minxes <HI>think</HI>&mdash;But <HI>I</HI> did once&mdash;I wonder in my heart, oftentimes&mdash;But men and women are chears to one another. But we may, in a great mea&s;ure, thank the poetical tribe for the fa&s;cination. I hate them all. Are they not inflamers of the wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions? With regard to the <HI>Epics,</HI> would Alexander, madman as he was, have been &s;o <HI>much</HI> a madman, had it not been for Homer? Of what violences, murders, depreda|tions, have not the Epic poets been the occa&s;ion, by propagating fal&s;e honour, fal&s;e glory, and fal&s;e reli|gion? Tho&s;e of the <HI>amorous cla&s;s</HI> ought in all ages (could their future genius's for tinkling &s;ound and mea|&s;ure have been known) to have been &s;trangled in their cradles. Abu&s;ers of talents given them for better pur|po&s;es (for all this time, I put Sacred poe&s;y out of the que&s;tion); and <HI>avowedly</HI> claiming a right to be <HI>licen|tious,</HI> and to overleap the bounds of decency, truth, and nature.</P>
<P>What a rant! How came the&s;e fellows into my rambling head? O, I remember&mdash;My whi&s;per to you led me into all this &s;tuff.</P>
<P>Well, and you at la&s;t recollected the trouble you have given my brother about you. Good girl! Had I re|membered that, I would have &s;pared you my reflexions upon the poets and poeta&s;ters of all ages, the <HI>truly</HI> -in&s;pired ones excepted: And yet I think the others &s;hould have been bani&s;hed <HI>our</HI> commonwealth, as well as Plato's.</P>
<P>Well, but, to &s;horten <HI>my</HI> non&s;en&s;e, now <HI>you</HI> have &s;hortened yours&mdash;The Day is at la&s;t fixed&mdash;Joy, joy, joy, to you, my lovely Harriet, and to my Brother! And it mu&s;t be a public affair!&mdash;Why&mdash;that's right, &s;ince it would be impo&s;&s;ible to make it a private one. My hone&s;t man is mad for joy. He fell down on his knees, to beg of me to accept of <HI>your</HI> invitation, and of <HI>his</HI> company. I made a merit of obliging him,
<PB N="289" REF="290">
tho' I would have been as humble to <HI>him,</HI> rather than not be with you; and yet, by one &s;aucy line, I ima|gine you had rather be without me.</P>
<P>Your cou&s;in Reeves's are ready to &s;et out.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you, invite aunt Nell: She thinks her&s;elf neglected. A nephew whom &s;he &s;o dearly loves! Very hard! &s;he &s;ays.&mdash;And &s;he never was but at one wedding, and has forgot how it was; and may never be at another&mdash;Pink and yellow, all is ready provided, go down or not&mdash;O but, if you choo&s;e not her com|pany, I will tell you how to come off&mdash;Give her your word and honour that &s;he &s;hall be a per&s;on of prime account at your fir&s;t Chri&s;tening. Yet &s;he would be glad to be pre&s;ent on both occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But ah, the poor Emily!&mdash;She has al&s;o been on her knees to me, to take her down with me&mdash;What &s;hall I do?&mdash;Dear Soul! &s;he embarra&s;&s;es me! I have put her upon writing to her Guardian, for his leave: I be|lieve &s;he has written. If &s;he knew her own ca&s;e, I think &s;he would not de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>Poor Lady L!&mdash;She is robbed, &s;he &s;ays, of one of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures of her life. Ah, Charlotte! &s;aid &s;he to me, wringing my hand, the&s;e hu&s;bands owe us a great deal. This is an humbling circum|&s;tance. Were not my Lord and yours the be&s;t of hu&s;bands&mdash;</P>
<P>The be&s;t of hu&s;bands! Wretches! &s;aid I. You may forgive yours, Caroline&mdash;You are a good crea|ture; but not I mine. And &s;omething el&s;e I &s;aid, that made her laugh in the mid&s;t of her <HI>lacrymals.</HI> But &s;he begs and prays of me, not to go down to you, unle&s;s all &s;hould be over with her. I can do her no good; and only increa&s;e my own apprehen&s;ions, if I am with her. A ble&s;&s;ed way two poor &s;ouls of &s;i&s;ters of us are in. Sorry fellows!</P>
<P>And yet, Harriet, with &s;uch pro&s;pects as the&s;e be|fore them, &s;ome girls leap windows, &s;wim rivers, climb walls&mdash;Duce take their folly: Their choice is

Says a good man, on a &s;till <HI>more</HI> &s;erious occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Good news! joyful news!&mdash;I &s;hall, I &s;hall, go down to you. Nothing to hinder me! Lord L. proud as a peacock, is this moment come for me: I am hurrying away with him.

<P>MY aunt is &s;o much afraid that every-thing will not be ready, that &s;he puts me upon writting to you, to ha&s;ten what remains&mdash;I am more than half a fool&mdash;But that I always was. My &s;pirits &s;ink at the thoughts of &s;o public a Day. The mind, my grand|mamma &s;ays, can but be full; and it would have been filled by the circum&s;tance, had not the publicne&s;s of the Day given me &s;omething more of grievance.</P>
<P>I am afraid, &s;ometimes, that I &s;hall not &s;upport my &s;pirits; that I &s;hall be ill&mdash;Then I think &s;omething will happen&mdash;Can it be, that I &s;hall be the wife of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on? I can hardly believe it.&mdash;Sir Charles is tenderly concered for me. It would be impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;ays, that the Day could be private, un|le&s;s I were to go to London; and the very propo&s;ing of that would put my uncle out of all patience, who prides him&s;elf in the thought of having his Harriet married from his own hou&s;e: Nor could I expect my
<PB N="291" REF="292">
grandmamma's pre&s;ence. He does all he can to a&s;&s;ure my heart, and divert me: A thou&s;and agreeable lively things he &s;ays: So tender, &s;o con&s;iderate, in his joy!&mdash;&s;urely I &s;hall be too happy. But will you come? Can you? And if you do, will you be good? Will you make my ca&s;e your own?</P>
<P>My uncle, at times, is prodigiou&s;ly head&s;trong. Every hour he does or &s;ays &s;omething wrong; yet we dare not chide him. Thur&s;day next will be one of the greate&s;t days of his life, he &s;ays; and it &s;hall be all his own. He either &s;ings, hums, or whi&s;tles, in every motion. He re&s;olves, he &s;ays, to get his be&s;t dancing legs in readine&s;s. He &s;tarted up from table after dinner this day, and caught hold of Lucy's hand, and whi&s;ked her round the room. <HI>Dear toad,</HI> he called her; a comman addre&s;s of his to Lucy (I &s;ay, becau&s;e &s;he has a jewel in her head); and flouri&s;hing about with her in a very humorous manner, put her quite out, on purpo&s;e to laugh at her; for &s;he would have been in, if he would have let her, for the humour-&s;ake. He was a fine dancer in his youth.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Orme breakfa&s;ted with us this morning. She, no doubt, threw her&s;elf in our way on purpo&s;e to hear the news of the appointed Day confirmed. My uncle officiou&s;ly told her, it would be one day next week. She named the very day, and turned pale, on his own|ing &s;he was not mi&s;taken. She hoped, &s;he &s;aid, her brother would bear the &s;hock, as he had been long de|&s;titute of hope. But, &s;aid &s;he, he promi&s;ed me, be|fore he went abroad, to carry me to London on a vi&s;it to &s;ome relations there. I will remind him; and hope to prevail on him to &s;et out next Monday or Tue&s;day.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you! my dear Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid &s;he, at parting; may your bu&s;tle be happily over! I &s;hall pity you. You will pay for being &s;o univer&s;ally admired. But your penance will be but for two days; the <HI>very</HI> Day, and that of your <HI>appearance;</HI> and in both your man will bear you out: His merit, his per&s;on, his

addre&s;s. Happy Mi&s;s Byron!&mdash;The univer&s;al appro|bation is yours. But I mu&s;t have you contrive &s;ome how, that my brother may &s;ee him before he is yours: His heart will be the ea&s;ier afterwards.</P>

<P>I Write a few lines, if, writing to you, I can write a few, by the &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger that carries down all the remaining apparatus, which was committed to my care. We women are &s;ad creatures for delaying things to the la&s;t moment. We hurry the men: We hurry our workwomen, milaners, mantuamakers, friends, allies, confederates, and our&s;elves. When once we have given the Day, night <HI>and</HI> day, we neither take re&s;t, nor give it: When, if we had the <HI>rare</HI> felicity of knowing our minds &s;ooner, all might go on fair and &s;oftly. But then the gentle pa&s;&s;ion, I doubt, would glide into in&s;ipidity. Well, and I have heard my brother &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That things in general are be&s;t as they are.'</Q> Why I believe &s;o; for all the&s;e hone&s;t &s;ouls, as mantuamakers, attire-women, work-women,

<HI>enjoy</HI> a hurry that is occa&s;ioned by a wedding, and are half as well plea&s;ed with it, as if it were their own. They &s;imper, &s;mirk, go&s;&s;ip, over Bridal finery; &s;pread this upon their arms or &s;houlders; admire that&mdash;Look you here&mdash;Look you there! And is not this?&mdash;Is not that?&mdash;And, Did you ever!&mdash;No, never, in my born days!&mdash;And is the Bride, do you &s;ay, &s;uch a lovely creature?&mdash;And is the Bridegroom as hand&s;ome a man, as &s;he a woman!&mdash;O lud! O dear!&mdash;Would to Heaven Northampton&s;hire were nearer, that one might &s;ee how charming, how graceful, how becoming! and &s;o-forth.</P>
<P>And why &s;hould not we women, after all, con|trive to make hurry-&s;kurries [You &s;ee how I correct my&s;elf as I go along] and make the world think our affairs a great part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of it, and that no|thing can be done without us? Since, after a few months are over, new novelties take place, and we get into corners, &s;igh, groan, look &s;illy and meagre, and at la&s;t are thrown into <HI>&s;traw,</HI> as it is called; poor Caroline's ca&s;e; who repines, that &s;he can't be pre|&s;ent on this new bu&s;tle in the family.

<P>But a word about Caroline&mdash;Were it not for her being deprived of this plea&s;ure, the good creature would be very happy. Lord L. and &s;he are as fond as apes. She has quite forgot all her &s;ufferings for him. He thanks her for his boy. She follows with her eye the little &s;tranger, and is delighted with all that is done <HI>with</HI> him, <HI>to</HI> him, <HI>for</HI> him: Is plea&s;ed with every|body, even with the very &s;ervants, who croud in, by permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee his little Lord&s;hip, and already claim an intere&s;t in him. Upon my word, &s;he makes a very pretty fond mother. And aunt Nell, who, by the way, was at the Crying-out, and was then <HI>&s;o</HI> frighted! <HI>&s;o</HI> thankful to God! and <HI>&s;o</HI> happy in her own &s;itua|tion!

What good creatures are we women!</P>
<P>Well, but I don't know what to do about Emily. The fir&s;t vice of the fir&s;t woman was curio&s;ity, and it runs through all her daughters. She has written to her Guardian, and nothing but an ab&s;olute prohibition will hinder her from making one in your train. Did the dear girl know the &s;tate of her own heart, &s;he would choo&s;e to be a thou&s;and miles off, rather than go. I have &s;et her woman and mine to di&s;courage her. I have rea&s;oned with her my&s;elf; but there is no &s;uch thing as giving her one's <HI>true</HI> rea&s;ons; nor would I, willingly: Becau&s;e &s;he her&s;elf, having not found out her Love to be Love, I hope the fire may be &s;mothered in her own heart, by the aid of time and di&s;cretion, before di&s;covery; whereas, if the doors of it were to be opened, and the air let in, it might &s;et the whole tenement in a blaze. Her Guardian's de|nial or a&s;&s;ent will come, perhaps, in time; yet <HI>hardly,</HI> neither; for we &s;hall &s;et out on Monday. Aunt Nell is &s;o plea&s;ed with her nur&s;ery of the <HI>little Peer,</HI> as &s;he primly calls him, that you are rid of even her <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> to be with you. Being &s;ure of this, I complimented her, that I knew your aunt Selby would have invited her, but that Lady L. would not be able to live with|out her company, all the world, and the world's wi&s;e, attentive and engro&s;&s;ed by your affair. She, good creature! was plea&s;ed&mdash;So as &s;he could but be thought of importance by &s;omebody, I knew &s;he would be happy. I told her, that you invited nobody, but left all to your friends&mdash;Ay, poor dear Soul, &s;aid &s;he; &s;he has enough to think of, well as &s;he loves your brother&mdash;and &s;ighed for <HI>you</HI>&mdash;Worthy Ancient! The &s;igh a little deeper, perhaps, for &s;ome of her own Recol|lections.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Reeves would not &s;tay for us. What will you do with us all?&mdash;Croud you, I &s;ear. But di&s;po&s;e of <HI>us,</HI> at Shirley-manor, or Selby-hou&s;e, as you plea&s;e. Yours, and aunt Selby's, and grand|mamma
<PB N="296" REF="297">
Shirley's concern for us, is all we are &s;olicit|ous about. But &s;ervants rooms, nay, cocklofts, hay|lofts, will do. We like to be put to our &s;hifts now-and-then&mdash;Something to talk of&mdash;</P>
<P>But I can tell you, if you don't know it already, Lord W. and his Lady are re&s;olved to do you honour on this occa&s;ion; but they will be but little trouble to you. My Lord's &s;teward has a half-brother, a gen|tleman-farmer, in your neighbourhood&mdash;Sheldon&mdash;They will be there: But perhaps you know of this a better way. They will make a &s;plendid part of your train. Gratitude is their inducement.</P>
<P>Lord L. has ju&s;t now told me, that my &s;i&s;ter, in tenderne&s;s to him, and in honour to you, has be&s;ought <HI>him</HI> to be pre&s;ent. O Harriet! what will you do with your&s;elf?&mdash;Aunt Nell and I have the heart-burn for you. But Lord L. <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be welcome: He is one of tho&s;e who &s;o faithfully kept your &s;ecret.</P>
<P>So, in <HI>our</HI> equipages, will be Lord L. my hone&s;t man, Emily, and your Charlotte: Lord L's equipages will be at the &s;ervice of any of your gue&s;ts; as will our &s;pare one&mdash;I wi&s;h Beauchamp could permit him|&s;elf to be pre&s;ent (I hope he will) on the nuptials of the friend &s;o dear to him, with a Lady he &s;o great|ly admires.</P>
<P>My woman and Emily's will be all our Female at|tendants: One nook will &s;erve them both.</P>
<P>My poor man will be mad, before the day comes. He <HI>does</HI> love you, Harriet. My brother, he &s;ays, will be the happie&s;t man in the world&mdash;<HI>him&s;elf excepted</HI>&mdash;A hypocrite!

the old leaven, Harriet! I can't help it. It is got out of my heart, half out of my head; but, when I take the pen, it will tingle now-and-then, at my finger's end.</P>
<P>Adieu, my Love! God ble&s;s you;&mdash;I can enter into your joy. A Love &s;o pure, and &s;o fervent. The man Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.&mdash;And into your <HI>pain,</HI> al&s;o, in view of a &s;olemnity &s;o near, and to you &s;o awful. With all my roguery, I &s;ympathize with you. I have not either a wicked or unfeeling heart. Such as yours, however, are the true &s;pirits; &s;uch as mine are only bully and fla&s;h.</P>
<P>Lucy, you are a good girl. I like the whim of your concluding for Harriet; I al&s;o like your tenants dining-room, and other managements, as the affair mu&s;t unavoidably be a public one.</P>
<P>Neither of you &s;ay a word of good Mr. Deane: I hope he is with you. He cannot be a cypher where|ever be comes, except on the right-&s;ide of the figure, to increa&s;e its con&s;equence. Don't be afraid of your uncle; I, I, I, will manage him, never fear.</P>
<P>There are other pa&s;&s;ages, Harriet, in your la&s;t Let|ter, which I ought to have an&s;wered to&mdash;But forgive me, my dear; I had laid it by (tho' plea&s;ed with it in the main); and, having an&s;wered the mo&s;t material part, by di&s;patching your things, forgot it as much as if I had not received it, till the moment I came to conclude.

<P>WELL, my Si&s;ter, my Friend, my dear Lady L. how do you? <HI>As well as can be expected,</HI> I hope: The an&s;wer of a thou&s;and years old, to every en|quirer, careful or ceremonious. And how does my dear little boy? As well <HI>as can be expected,</HI> too&mdash;I am glad of it.</P>
<P>Here we are!&mdash;Every-body well, and happy.</P>
<P>I was afraid my brother would have looked more <HI>polite</HI> upon us than <HI>familiar,</HI> as he invited us not: But, no!&mdash;He was all him&s;elf, as Harriet &s;ays. He
<PB N="300" REF="301">
met us at our coach-door. He handed out his ward. She could not &s;peak. Tears were in her eyes. I could have beat her with my fan. He ki&s;&s;ed her cheek. My dear child, I thank you mo&s;t &s;incerely for your good|ne&s;s to your mother.</P>
<P>I was afraid that her joy would then have been too much for her. She expanded, &s;he collected, her plumes. Her &s;pread arms (&s;oon, however, clo&s;ed) &s;hewed me, that &s;he with difficulty re&s;trained her&s;elf from falling at his feet. He turned from her to me. My be&s;t Charlotte, how do you? The journey, I hope, has not incommoded you. He led me out, and, taking each of the hone&s;t men by the hand, My dean Lords, you do me honour. He then congratu|lated Lord L. on the pre&s;ent you had made him, and the family, he &s;aid.</P>
<P>At the inner-gate met us our &s;weet Harriet, with joy upon one brow, half the cares of this mortal life on the other&mdash;She led us into the Cedar-parlour, my brother returning to welcome in the two hone&s;t men, and threw her arms about my neck&mdash;My deare&s;t Lady G. how much does your pre&s;ence rejoice me!&mdash;I hope (and looked at me) your journey&mdash;Be quiet, Harriet!&mdash;You mu&s;t not think &s;o much of the&s;e matters, my Love. She was a little aba&s;hed&mdash;Don't be afraid of me; I will be very good, &s;aid I. Then will I be very thankful, replied &s;he.</P>
<P>My lovely Emily! turning to her: How does my &s;weet friend! Welcome, once more, to Selby-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The girl's heart was full&mdash;She, thanking her only by a deep courte&s;y, abruptly withdrew to the window; and, trying for a third hem, in hopes to &s;tifle her emo|tion, it broke into a half-&s;ob, and tears followed.</P>
<P>Harriet and I looked; <HI>&s;he</HI> compa&s;&s;ionately, <HI>I</HI> vex|edly, I believe; and both &s;hook our heads at each other.</P>
<P>Take no notice, &s;aid I, &s;eeing Harriet move to|wards the window to her&mdash;It will go off of it&s;elf. Her joy to &s;ee Harriet, that's all.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="302">
But I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> take notice (for &s;he found that Emily heard her) My dear Emily, my lovely young friend&mdash;why, why&mdash;</P>
<P>I will tell you, madam, interrupted &s;he, and threw her arms about Harriet's neck, as Harriet (&s;itting in the window) cla&s;ped her's about her wai&s;t; and I will tell you truth, and nothing but the truth&mdash;You wrote &s;o cool to me, about my coming&mdash;And yet I to come! But I could not help it&mdash;And I thought you now looked a little &s;everely upon me&mdash;But Love, and I, will &s;ay, Duty to you, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron, AND NOTHING ELSE, made me &s;o earne&s;t to come. Say you forgive me.</P>
<P>Forgive you, my deare&s;t Emily!&mdash;I had only your &s;ake, my dear, in view. If I wrote with le&s;s warmth than you expected, forgive <HI>me.</HI> Con&s;ider my &s;itua|tion, my Love. You are, and ever will be, welcome to me. Your griefs, your joys, are mine&mdash;Give me which you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The girl! bur&s;t into fre&s;h tears&mdash;I, I, I am now as unable, &s;obbed &s;he, to bear your goodne&s;s, as before I was your di&s;plea&s;ure&mdash;But hide, hide me! Here comes my Guardian!&mdash;What now, when he &s;ees me thus, will become of me?</P>
<P>She heard his voice at the door, leading in the two Lords; and they followed by Mr. Selby, Mrs. Selby, Lucy, and Nancy.</P>
<P>Sir Charles went to the two young Ladies. Har|riet kept her &s;eat, her arms folded about Emily; Emi|ly's glowing face in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Sweet emotion! &s;aid he, my Emily in tears of joy!</P>
<P>&mdash;What a charming picture!&mdash;O my Mi&s;s Byron, how does your tenderne&s;s to this amiable child oblige me! I &s;ever you not; cla&s;ping his generous arms a|bout them both.</P>
<P>I have afflicted my dear Emily, Sir, without intend|ing it. I wrote coldly, my precious young friend thinks; and her Love for me makes her &s;weetly-&s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="302" REF="303">
of my &s;uppo&s;ed ingratitude. But believe me, my dear, I love you with a true &s;i&s;terly tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>I took the dear girl a&s;ide, and gently expo&s;tulated with her, upon the childi&s;hne&s;s of her behaviour, and the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he would give to Mi&s;s Byron, as well as to her&s;elf, by repetitions of the like weakne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>She promi&s;ed fair; but, Lady L. I wi&s;h there were more of the child, and le&s;s of the woman, in this affair. Poor thing! &s;he was very thankful for my advice; and expre&s;&s;ed how wrong &s;he was, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it might di&s;courage her Guardian and Mi&s;s Byron, that <HI>now was,</HI> from letting her live with them: But for my life, &s;aid &s;he, whatever was the matter with me, I could not help my fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Nancy Selby took Emily up with her; and uncle Selby and I had a little lively hit at each other, in the old &s;tile. We drew my brother in. I had not tried his &s;trength a good while: But, as Harriet &s;aid in one of the &s;aucie&s;t Letters &s;he ever wrote, I &s;oon found he was the wrong per&s;on to meddle with. Yet he is &s;uch a charming raillier, that I wonder he can re&s;i&s;t his talent. <HI>No</HI> wonder, Harriet would &s;ay; be|cau&s;e he has talents &s;o &s;uperior to that which, &s;he &s;ays, runs away with his poor &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Emily came down to us very compo&s;ed, and be|haved prettily enough: But had my brother as much manni&s;h vanity as &s;ome of the &s;orry fellows have, who have no pretence for it, he would di&s;cern the poor Emily's foible to have &s;ome little &s;u&s;ceptibility in it. I am glad he does not; for it would grieve him. I have already told him of the &s;ufferings of poor Lady Anne S. on her hearing he is near marriage; and he expre&s;&s;ed great concern upon it for that really-worthy woman.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves, his wife, and Mr. Deane, were abroad when we arrived. They came in to tea. Our mu|tual congratulations on the expected happy event, cheared our own hearts, and would have delighted
<PB N="303" REF="304">
yours. Charming, charming, is the behaviour of my brother to his Bride-elect. You can have no notion of it; becau&s;e at Colnebrook we always &s;aw him acting under a re&s;traint; owing, as &s;ince we have found, to Honour, Con&s;cience, and a prior Love.</P>
<P>He diverts and turns the cour&s;e of &s;ubjects that he thinks would be affecting to her; yet in &s;uch a man|ner, as it is hardly perceivable to be his intention to do &s;o: For he makes &s;omething of the begun ones contribute to the new ones; &s;o that, before uncle Selby is aware of it, he finds him&s;elf in one that he had not in his head when he &s;at out.&mdash;And then he comes with his <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'What a pize was I going to &s;ay? But this is not what I had in my head.'</Q> And then, as my brother knows he mi&s;&s;es his &s;cent, only becau&s;e it has not afforded the merry mortal &s;omething to laugh at; he furni&s;hes him with &s;ome lively and in|nocent occa&s;ion which produces that effect, and then Mr. Selby is &s;atisfied. Mrs. Selby and Lucy &s;ee how my brother manages him; yet find it &s;o delicately done, that &s;omething ari&s;es from it that keeps the ho|ne&s;t man in credit with him&s;elf and every-body el&s;e, for facetiou&s;ne&s;s, good-humour, good heart, and tho&s;e qualities which really are his due, and make him in his wor&s;t &s;ubjects tolerable, and in his be&s;t valuable.</P>
<P>Venerable Mrs. Shirley is to be here all to-morrow and next day. Mr. Deane has cho&s;en Shirley-manor for his abode, for the time he &s;tays; &s;o has James Selby, in order to make more room at Selby-hou&s;e for us women. There too Mr. and Mrs. Reeves take up, of choice, their lodgings, tho' here all day.</P>
<P>Poor Harriet! She told <HI>me</HI> once, that fear makes cowards loving. She is &s;o fond of me and Lucy, and her aunt, at times, it would be a &s;in not to pity her. Yet Lucy once to&s;&s;ed up her head, upon my &s;aying &s;o&mdash;Pity her! why, yes, I think I do, now you have put me in the head of it: But I don't know whether &s;he is not more to be envied. Lucy is a polite girl.
<PB N="304" REF="305">
She loves her Harriet. But &s;he knew I &s;hould be plea&s;ed with the compliment to my brother.</P>
<P>Harriet has ju&s;t now looked in upon me&mdash;Writing, Lady G. And of me?&mdash;To Lady L. I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
<P>She cla&s;ped her arms about me: Ah, madam! Thur&s;day! Thur&s;day!</P>
<P>What of Thur&s;day?</P>
<P>Is the day after to-morrow!</P>
<P>Every child can tell that, Harriet.</P>
<P>Ah but I, with &s;uch happine&s;s before me, am &s;il|lier <HI>than</HI> a child!</P>
<P>Well, but I can tell you &s;omething, Harriet.</P>
<P>What is that?</P>
<P>That the next day to Thur&s;day, is Friday&mdash;The next to that is Saturday&mdash;The next&mdash;</P>
<P>Pi&s;h! I'll &s;tay no longer with you, giving me a gentle tap&mdash;I would not have an&s;wered you &s;o.</P>
<P>Away &s;he tript, de&s;iring her affectionate compli|ments to dear Lady L.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ee! Have I any more to write? I think not. But a call for &s;upper makes me leave my paper un&s;ub&s;cribed.</P>
<P>EMILY behaved very prettily at &s;upper; but it would have been as well, if &s;he had not thought &s;o her&s;elf: For &s;he boa&s;ted of her behaviour afterwards to me. That made it look like an <HI>extraordinary</HI> in her own account.</P>
<P>Mr. Selby &s;ung us a &s;ong, with a good Fox-hunter air. There is &s;omething very agreeable in his fa|cetiou&s;ne&s;s: But it would become nobody el&s;e. I think you and I agreed at Dun&s;table, that he is a fine, jolly, hearty, hand&s;ome-<HI>i&s;h</HI> man&mdash;He looks &s;hrewd, arch, open, a true country gentleman a&s;pect; what he &s;ays is <HI>&s;o-&s;o</HI>&mdash;What he means is better.&mdash;He is very fond of your Lord&mdash;But I think rather fonder of <HI>mine</HI>&mdash;A criterion, Lady L!</P>
<P>As for Lord G. he is in the &s;ituation of Harriet's

<P>WITH what re&s;pect (all his Re&s;pect has Love in it) did he attend Mrs. Shirley to her &s;eat! And then ha&s;tening to Lord and Lady W. he &s;aluted them both, and acknowleged the honour done him by their pre|&s;ence;

an hour, he &s;aid, that he could not have expected, nor therefore had the thought, the di&s;tance &s;o great, of a&s;king for it.</P>
<P>He then paid his compliments, in the mo&s;t affe|ctionate manner, to his amiable friend Beauchamp; who, on his thanking him for his uninvited pre&s;ence, &s;aid, He could not deny him&s;elf being pre&s;ent at a &s;o|lemnity that was to complete the happine&s;s of the be&s;t of men, and be&s;t of friends.</P>
<P>Sir Charles addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the young Ladies who were mo&s;t &s;trangers to him; apologizing to them, as they were engaged with Mr. Selby, Mr. Deane and Lord G. that he did not at fir&s;t. He &s;at a few minutes with them: What he &s;aid, I heard not; but they &s;miled, blu&s;hed, and looked delighted upon each other. Every-body followed him in his motions, with their eye. So much pre&s;ence of mind, never met with &s;o much mode&s;ty of behaviour, and &s;o charming a vivacity.</P>
<P>The young Ladies came only <HI>intendedly</HI> to break|fa&s;t, and that at Mr. Selby's odd invitation. They had the good &s;en&s;e to apologize for their coming this day, as they were to make part of the cavalcade, as I may call it to-morrow. But the odd &s;oul had met the four at a neighbouring Lady's, where he made a go&s;&s;iping vi&s;it, and would make them come with him.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that nobody cared to find fault with him; &s;o I began to rate him; and a very whim&s;ical dialogue pa&s;&s;ed between us at one end of the room, while Sir Charles, Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby, Lady W. and Harriet, were in clo&s;e talk at the other.</P>
<P>I made the hone&s;t man a&s;hamed of him&s;elf; and every-body in our circle was plea&s;ed with us. This mi&s;led me to go on; and &s;o, by attending to his non|&s;en&s;e, and pur&s;uing my own, I lo&s;t the opportunity of hearing a conver&s;ation, which, I dare &s;ay, would have been worth repeating to you by pen and ink.

Mr. Orme and his Si&s;ter, we are told, &s;et out ye&s;ter|day for London. Mrs. Selby and Harriet are yet afraid of Greville.</P>
<P>The gentlemen and &s;ome of the Ladies, my&s;elf (but not Harriet) among them, have been to look at the preparations made in the le&s;&s;er Park, for the recep|tion of the tenants. Mr. Selby prided him&s;elf not a little on his contrivances there. When we returned, we found Harriet at one end of the great parlour, &s;itting with Emily; her grandmother, Mr. Selby, Lucy, in conver&s;ation at the other; the good girl's hand in hers, Emily blu&s;hing, looking down, but de|lighted, as it &s;eemed; Harriet, with &s;weetne&s;s, love, and compa&s;&s;ion, intermingled in her a&s;pect, talking to her, and bending over her, her fine neck. I thought I never &s;aw her look &s;o lovely. Elder &s;i&s;ter like, and younger, one in&s;tructing in love, the other li&s;tening with plea&s;ure. They (unob&s;erved by them&s;elves) took every-body's attention, as the room filled with the company, who all crouded about Mrs. Shirley, affect|ing not to heed the two friends. What would I give, &s;aid Lady W. to Sir Charles and her Lord, for a picture of tho&s;e two young Ladies (Emily ju&s;t then ki&s;&s;ed the hand of her lovely friend with emotion, and Harriet lifted up Emily's to her lips) if Love, Dignity, and &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ion, could be drawn in the face of one Lady; and that Reverence, Gratitude, and mode&s;t At|tention, in the other? I congratulate you, Sir Charles, with all my heart. I have ob&s;erved with rapture, from every look, every word, and from the whole behaviour of Mi&s;s Byron, that your goodne&s;s to hun|dreds will be <HI>greatly</HI> recompen&s;ed. O my good Lord W. turning to him, Mi&s;s Byron will pay all our debts.</P>
<P>Every attitude, every look, of Mi&s;s Byron's, &s;aid my Lord, would furni&s;h out a fine picture. I cannot keep my eye from her, where-ever &s;he is.</P>

How plea&s;ed was Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby&mdash;Every|body! But what a different man is Lord W. to what he once was! lifted up from low keeping, to a wife, who, by her behaviour, good &s;en&s;e, politene&s;s, gives him con&s;equence. Once I thought him one of the lowe&s;t of men. I denied him, in my heart, a relation to my mother, and thought him a &s;avage.</P>
<P>The two young Ladies, finding them&s;elves ob|&s;erved, &s;tood up, in a parting po&s;ture; but Emily &s;eeming eager to detain her dear friend's attention, Harriet took a hand of Emily's in each of hers.</P>
<P>I had fidled that way&mdash;Yes, my dear, &s;aid the lovely Harriet, friend&s;hip unalterable by time or fate, as you &s;ay. Deare&s;t Emily, command me ever.</P>
<P>Emily looked about her&mdash;O madam, I want to <HI>kneel</HI> to you.

<P>You were born for each other. God pre&s;erve you both, for an example to a world that wants it.</P>
<P>Harriet courte&s;ied to Beauchamp. Her face was over&s;pread with a fine crim&s;on; but &s;he attempted not to &s;peak. She &s;queezed her&s;elf, as it were, between the chairs of her grandmamma and aunt; then turned about, and looked <HI>&s;o</HI> charmingly!

<P>And how much happier will &s;he be in yours, ma|dam! replied he. Of what a care, my Emily, turn|ing to her, has this admirable Lady already relieved my heart! the care the greater, as you de&s;erve it all. In every-thing take her direction: It will be the di|rection of love and prudence. What an amiable companion will you make her! and how happy will your love of each other make me!</P>
<P>Emily got behind me, as it were. Speak for me to my guardian, promi&s;e for me, madam&mdash;You never never, &s;hall break your word through my fault.</P>

<P>A &s;un-beam from my brother's eye &s;eemed to play upon his face, and dazle his eyes. The fine youth withdrew behind Lady W's chair. Mr. Selby, who had been &s;o good as to give us his &s;ilent attention, then &s;poke, with a twang through his no&s;e.

Your good Lord, my dear, enjoyed the plea&s;ure we all had: Mine to&s;&s;ed up his head, and &s;eemed to &s;nuff the wind: And yet, my dear Lady L. there was no|thing &s;o very extraordinary &s;aid; but the <HI>manner</HI> was the thing, which &s;hewed a meaning, that left language behind it.</P>
<P>My brother is ab&s;olutely pa&s;&s;ive as to the oeconomy of the approaching &s;olemnity. Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby, Lady W. your Charlotte, and Lucy, are the council appointed; but uncle Selby will put in, to mar&s;hal this happy proceeding. <HI>What a pize,</HI> he &s;ays, is not Harriet <HI>his</HI> daughter? Will it not be his Day?</P>
<P>Mrs Selby tries to &s;mile off his oddity; but now-and-then we &s;ee her good-naturedly redden at it, as if for his &s;ake. Lucy looks at her uncle as if &s;he could hardly away with his particularities; but Mrs. Shirley has always &s;omething to &s;ay for him. She enters into his character: She knows the hone&s;ty, as well as ge|nero&s;ity, of his heart: That it all proceeds from joy and love; and always allows for him&mdash;As I would have my friends allow for me: And, to &s;ay truth, I, for my own part, like him the better for wanting al|lowances; becau&s;e his ca&s;e, in that re&s;pect, is mine. Ah, my dear! it is the thoughtful, half-a&s;leep, half-awake, blinking cat, that catches the mou&s;e.

Uncle Selby has provided &s;even gentlemen of the neighbourhood, to match the number of the Ladies; for there will be &s;ixteen of us: Mr. <HI>God&s;rey,</HI> Mr. <HI>Steele,</HI> Mr. <HI>Falconbridge,</HI> three agreeable young men, &s;ons of gentlemen in the neighbourhood, Mr. Selby's cho&s;en friends and companions in his field-&s;ports; his cou&s;in <HI>Holles,</HI> brother to the Mi&s;s Holles's, an admirer of Mi&s;s Nedham; young Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> an admirer of Mi&s;s Barclay; Mr. <HI>Alle&s;tree,</HI> a nephew of Sir John, a young man of &s;ine qualities engaged to Mi&s;s Dolly Nedham: and Lord <HI>Reresby</HI> of Ireland (related to Mr. Selby's favourite Sir Thomas Falconbridge), a young nobleman of &s;hining parts, great mode&s;ty, good-nature, and, what is worth them all, Mrs. Shirley &s;ays, a man of virtue.</P>
<P>Lord W. was very de&s;irous of giving &s;o rich a jewel as Harriet to his nephew, in return, as he &s;aid, for <HI>as</HI> rich a jewel which he had pre&s;ented to him; but Mr. Selby would not admit of that. I told him, on his appeal to me, that he was right, once in his life.</P>
<P>Mr. Selby talks much of the mu&s;ic he has provided for to-morrow. He &s;peaks of it as a <HI>band,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>WE have had a mo&s;t agreeable evening. My bro|ther was the Soul of the company. His addre&s;s to his Harriet was re&s;pectfully-affectionate, yet, for her &s;ake, not very peculiar. Every-body, in turn, had his kind|e&s;t notice, and were happy in it. The next day's &s;olemnity was o&s;ten hinted at by Mr. Selby, and even by my flippant Lord&mdash;But Sir Charles always in&s;en|&s;ibly led to more general &s;ubjects; and this &s;upported the &s;pirits of the too thoughtful Harriet, and &s;he be|haved, on the whole, very prettily. His joy vi&s;ibly was joy; but it &s;eemed to be joy of &s;o familiar and ea&s;y a nature, as if it would la&s;t.</P>
<P>He once occa&s;ionally told the happy commencement
<PB N="313" REF="314">
of his acquaintance with Mi&s;s Byron; on purpo&s;e, I &s;aw, to remind her, that he ought not to be thought of as a &s;tranger to her, and to engage her in an ea&s;y familiarity. But there was a delicacy ob&s;erved by him in the remembered commencement. He put it not from the time that he re&s;cued her from Sir Hargrave; but from the fir&s;t vi&s;it &s;he made me in St. James's Square; tho' &s;he, with great gratitude, carried it back to its real commencement.</P>
<P>Mrs. Shirley retired &s;oon, as is her cu&s;tom, her Harriet attending her. The old Lady is lame, and infirm; but, as &s;he &s;its, is a very fine woman; and every-body &s;ees that &s;he was once a beauty. I thought I never &s;aw beauty in full bloom &s;o beautiful as when it &s;upported beauty in ruins, on the old Lady's retiring with a face <HI>&s;o</HI> happy, leaning one arm on her lovely grandchild, a neat crutch-&s;tick in the other, lightning her weight to the delicately-formed &s;upporter of her old age. It was &s;o &s;triking a picture, that every &s;oul all &s;tanding up, from reverence, or her retreating, ob|&s;erved it; and no one knew which ob&s;erved it fir&s;t, when the door &s;hurt out the graceful figures.</P>
<P>The old Lady's lamene&s;s is owing, it &s;eems, to a &s;prained &s;inew, got in leading up a dance, not many years ago, propo&s;ed by her&s;elf, in order to crown the reconciliation which &s;he had brought about, between a couple that had, till then been unhappy; and which her good-nature and joy made her not &s;en&s;ible of till &s;he &s;at down. Pity, pity, that any-thing &s;hould have hurt &s;o benign, &s;o chearful, &s;o benevolent, a woman! Why did not Harriet tell us this circum&s;tance? It would have heightened our value for her: And the more, if &s;he had told us, as is the truth, that &s;he never con&s;iders it as a hurt (&s;o honourably come by) but when &s;he thinks &s;he is trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e about her.</P>
<P>Harriet returned to company more chearful than when &s;he left it, enriched with her grandmother's
<PB N="314" REF="315">
ble&s;&s;ings, and prayers for her and my brother (as &s;he whi&s;pered me) and in having been allowed to &s;upport the tottering parent.</P>
<P>Harriet, &s;aid I, aloud, you were a very naughty girl to accu&s;e me, as once you did, of reflecting upon age. You never, in my eyes, looked more lovely than you did half an hour ago, &s;upporting the be&s;t of old Ladies.</P>
<P>We are of your Lady&s;hip's mind, &s;aid Lady W. A new grace, believe me, my dear, &s;hone out in every graceful feature.</P>
<P>Your kind notice, Ladies, bowing to me and Lady W. does me honour; but more to your own hearts.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t gracefully does the dear girl receive and return a compliment; but this, Lady L. I need not now &s;ay to you: We have both admired her on the&s;e occa&s;ions. How happy will &s;he make a man, who can be &s;o <HI>&s;en|&s;ible</HI> of his happine&s;s! And how happy will <HI>he</HI> make <HI>her! He,</HI> who has the mo&s;t grateful and enlarged of human hearts!</P>
<P>Mr. Deane, Sir Charles, Lord and Lady W. Mrs. Shirley, Mr. and Mrs. Selby, Lucy, Lord L. and I withdrew, to read, and &s;ee &s;igned, the Marriage|articles, &s;oon after tea (I tell you things out of cour&s;e, Lady L. as they come into my head): When they were ready to &s;ign, the dear Harriet was &s;ent for in. She would not come before. She begged, &s;he prayed, &s;he might not. The fir&s;t line of each clau&s;e, and the la&s;t for form &s;ake, were run over, by Mr. Deane, as fa&s;t as he could read. How the dear creature trem|bled when &s;he came in, and all the time of the &s;hort|ened reading! But when the pen was given her, to write her name, &s;he dropt it twice, on the parchment. Sir Charles &s;aw her emotion with great concern; and held her up, as &s;he &s;tood. My deare&s;t life, &s;aid he, take time, take time&mdash;Do not hurry; putting the pen each time, with reverence, in her fingers. She tried to write, but twice her pen would not touch the
<PB N="315" REF="316">
parchment, &s;o as to mark it. She &s;at down. Take time, take time, my Love, repeated he. She &s;oon made another effort, his arm round her wai&s;t&mdash;She then &s;igned them; but Sir Charles held her hand, and the parchments in them, when &s;he delivered them.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'As your act and deed, my deare&s;t Love?'</Q> &s;aid Sir Charles.&mdash;'Yes, indeed,' &s;aid the dear creature, and made him a courte&s;y; hardly knowing what &s;he did.</P>
<P>She mu&s;t hear of this, when &s;he can bear it. You charged me to be very minute on the behaviour of our Harriet: You was &s;ure it would be a pattern. But, no! you &s;ee &s;he is too timid.</P>
<P>She accompanied me to my chamber when we re|tired for the night. She &s;igned. I took notice of it.&mdash;O my Charlotte! &s;aid &s;he, To-morrow! To-morrow!&mdash;</P>
<P>Will be the beginning of your happine&s;s, my Har|riet!&mdash;What virgin heart, &s;aid I, but mu&s;t have had joy, on her contemplating the man of &s;en&s;e and polite|ne&s;s, had his behaviour of this night <HI>only</HI> been the te&s;t of her judgment of him?</P>
<P>True! And I <HI>have</HI> joy: But the circum&s;tance be|fore me is a &s;olemn one: And does not the obligation lie all on his &s;ide?</P>
<P>Does he behave to you, my Love, as if he thought <HI>any</HI> of it did?</P>
<P>O no, no! But the fact is otherwi&s;e; and as <HI>I</HI> know it, the obligation is heightened by his polite goodne&s;s to me.</P>
<P>Dearly does he love his Harriet (To-morrow will you be <HI>his</HI> Harriet for life). Are you not convinced that he loves you?</P>
<P>I am, I am! But&mdash;</P>
<P>But what, my dear?</P>
<P>I never can de&s;erve him. Haple&s;s, haple&s;s Clemen|tina! &s;he <HI>only</HI> could! Let a &s;ortnight after to-morrow be over, and &s;he be not <HI>un</HI> -happy, and what a thrice happy creature &s;hall I be!</P>

I ki&s;&s;ed her glowing cheek.&mdash;Support your&s;elf like a heroine to-morrow, my dear. You <HI>will</HI> have a ta&s;k, becau&s;e of the crouds which will attend you; but it is the tax you pay for being &s;o excellent, and &s;o much beloved.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;trange, Lady G. that my grandmamma &s;hould join to &s;upport my uncle in his vehemence for a public day? Had it been only <HI>his</HI> command, I would have rebelled!</P>
<P>The pride they take in the alliance with my bro|ther, not for his &s;ituation in life, but for his tran&s;cend|ent merit, is their motive; your grandmother's parti|cularly. She con&s;iders the day as one of the happie&s;t of her life: She has begged of me to &s;upport you in undergoing it. She &s;ays, If there &s;hould be a thou|&s;and &s;pectators, &s;he knows it will give plea&s;ure to as many hearts; and to hers the more, for that rea&s;on. And you will be, continued I, &s;o lovely a Pair, when joined, that every beholder, man and woman, will give him to you; you to him.</P>
<P>You are very good, my dear Lady G. to encourage me thus: But I told my grandmother, this night, that &s;he knew not the hard&s;hip &s;he had impo&s;ed on me, by in&s;i&s;ting on a public day; but I would not begin &s;o great a change, whatever it co&s;t me, by an act of op|po&s;ition or di&s;obedience to the will of &s;o dear a parent. But your <HI>brother,</HI> my dear Lady G. continued &s;he, who would have thought <HI>he</HI> would have given into it?</P>
<P>As your friends mean a compliment to my brother, replied I; &s;o he, by his acquie&s;cence, means one to you, and to them. He is not a con&s;ident man: He looks upon Marriage in as awful a light as you do; but he is not &s;hy of making a public declaration of his Love to the woman he has cho&s;en. He has told me, talking of this very &s;ubject, that a public ceremony is not what, for your delicacy-&s;ake, he would have pro|po&s;ed: But <HI>being</HI> propo&s;ed, he would not, by any means, decline it. He had no concern but for you;
<PB N="317" REF="318">
and he took your acquie&s;cence as a noble in&s;tance of your duty and obligingne&s;s to one of the mo&s;t affectio|nate and worthy of parents.</P>
<P>O my dear Lady G. how good was you to come down! Support me in the arduous ta&s;k of To-mor|row!&mdash;You will not want my &s;upport, my love; you will have Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, bound, both by Duty and Love, to &s;upport you.</P>
<P>She threw her arms about me: I will endeavour to behave as I ought, in a circum&s;tance that &s;hall intitle me to &s;uch protection, and to &s;uch a Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>My fidgeting Lord thru&s;t in (un&s;ent for) his &s;harp face; and I chiding him for his intru&s;ion, &s;he &s;lipt away, or I had de&s;igned to a tend her to her chamber; and there, perhaps, &s;hould we have &s;taid together mo&s;t part of the night. If I had, I don't &s;uppo&s;e that I &s;hould have deprived <HI>her</HI> of any re&s;t. What makes my fooli&s;h heart throb for her? &s;o happy as &s;he is likely to be!&mdash;But &s;incerely do I love her.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told you, that Emily behaved very prettily. Mr. Beauchamp had a rich opportunity to engage her, while the &s;ettlements were executing.</P>
<P>On our return to them, the poor girl was wiping her eyes. How now, Emily? &s;aid I &s;oftly. O ma|dam, Mr. Beauchamp has been telling me how ill Sir Harry is! His own eyes &s;et mine the example. How I pity him! And how good he is!&mdash;No wonder my Guardian loves him.</P>
<P>Beauchamp may po&s;&s;ibly catch her in a weeping fit. The heart &s;oftened by grief, will turn to a comforter. Our own grief produces pity for another: Pity, Love. They are next neighbours, and will call in to a&s;k kindly how a &s;ufferer does: And what a heart mu&s;t that be, that will not admini&s;ter comfort when it makes a neigbourly call, if comfort be in its power?</P>

<P>YOU &s;hall find me, my dear Si&s;ter, as minute as you wi&s;h. Lucy is a charming girl. For the humour's &s;ake, as well as to forward each other, on the joyful occa&s;ion, we &s;hall write by turns.</P>
<P>It would look as if we had determined upon a pub|lic day, in the very face of it, were we to appear in full dre&s;&s;es: The contrary, therefore, was agreed upon ye&s;terday. But every one, however, intends to be dre&s;&s;ed as elegantly as Morning-dre&s;&s;es can make them. Harriet, as you &s;hall hear, is the lea&s;t &s;hewy. All in Virgin white.

Tenderne&s;s and Love are in|deed Tenderne&s;s and Love in the brave and manly heart. Emily will not be married, on any con&s;i|deration. There is a terror, and not joy, &s;he &s;ays, in the attending circum&s;tances.

<P>Each coach four hor&s;es. Sir Charles's &s;tate-coach to be re&s;erved for the day of public appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="322">
[From Selby-hou&s;e to the Church, Half a mile, in Coaches; Foot-way not &s;o much.]</P>
<P>Emily was very earne&s;t to be Bride-maid, tho' ad|vi&s;ed to the contrary.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp was a Brideman, at his own re|que&s;t al&s;o.</P>
<P>I will go back to the early part of the morning.</P>
<P>We are each of us &s;erenaded, as I may &s;ay, by di|rection of this joyful man uncle Selby <HI>(awakened,</HI> as he called it, to mu&s;ic) by James Selby, playing at each per&s;on's door an air or two, the words from an Epitha|lamium (who&s;e, I know not);</P>
<LG>
<L>The Day is come, you wi&s;hed &s;o long:</L>
<L>Love picked it out among the throng:</L>
<L>He de&s;tines to him&s;elf this Sun,</L>
<L>And takes the reins, and drives it on.</L>
</LG>
<P>It is indeed a fine day. The &s;un &s;eemed to re|proach &s;ome of us; but Harriet &s;lept not a wink. No wonder.</P>
<P>I ha&s;tened up to &s;alute her. She was ready dre&s;&s;ed. Charming readine&s;s, my Love, &s;aid I! I took the opportunity while I was able, an&s;wered &s;he.</P>
<P>Lucy, Nancy, were with her, both dre&s;&s;ed, as &s;he, for the Day; that they might have nothing to do but attend her. What joy in their faces! What &s;weet carefulne&s;s in the lovely Harriet's!&mdash;And <HI>will</HI> this Day, &s;aid &s;he once, in a low voice, to me, give me to the Lord of my Heart?&mdash;Let not <HI>grief</HI> come near it; <HI>joy</HI> can be enough painful!</P>
<P>Her grandmamma was &s;oon ready. Harriet hur|ried in to her grandmamma'a apartment, to crave her ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Lucy.]My cou&s;in, her &s;pirits over-hurried, was ready to &s;aint in her grandmother's arms; but, re|vived by the &s;oothings, the ble&s;&s;ings, of her venerable parent, &s;oon recovered. Let nobody be frighted, &s;aid
<PB N="322" REF="323">
her grandmother: Affright not, by your hurryings, my lovely child! A little fatigued; her &s;pirits are hur|ried: Her joy is too much for them.</P>
<P>What a charming pre&s;ence of mind has Mrs. Shir|ley! Lady G. bids me write any-thing to your La|dy&s;hip, &s;o I will but write; and forbids me apolo|gizing either for manner or words.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was admitted. She &s;tood up the mo|ment &s;he &s;aw him, Love and Reverence in her &s;weet a&s;pect. With a kind impatience he ha&s;tened to her, and threw him&s;elf at her feet, taking her hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it with his lips&mdash;Re&s;ume your magnanimity, my deare&s;t Life: With the man before you, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, you will have <HI>more</HI> than a chance for happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Forgive me, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, &s;itting down (She could hardly &s;tand): I can have no doubt of your goodne&s;s: But it is a great Day! The Solemnity is an awful one!</P>
<P>It is a great, a &s;olemn, Day to <HI>me,</HI> my deare&s;t crea|ture! But encourage my joy by your &s;miles. It can &s;uffer abatement only by giving you pain.</P>
<P>Generous goodne&s;s! But&mdash;</P>
<P>But what, my Love?&mdash;In compliment to the be&s;t of Parents, to the kinde&s;t of Uncles, re&s;ume your u&s;ual pre&s;ence of mind. I el&s;e, who &s;hall glory before a thou&s;and witne&s;&s;es in receiving the honour of your hand, &s;hall be ready to regret that I acquie&s;ced &s;o chearfully with the wi&s;hes of tho&s;e parental friends for a public celebration.</P>
<P>I have not been of late well, Sir: My mind is weakened. But it would be ungrateful, If I did not own to you, that my joy is as &s;trong as my fear: It overcame me. I hope I &s;hall behave better. You &s;hould not have been called to be a witne&s;s of my weakne&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>This Day, my deare&s;t Love, we call upon the world to witne&s;s to our mutual vows. Let us &s;hew that
<PB N="323" REF="324">
world, that our Hearts are one; and that the Cere|mony, &s;acred as it is, cannot make them more &s;o. The engagement is a holy one: Let us &s;hew the Multitude as well as our &s;urrounding Friends, that we think it a laudable one. Once more I call upon you, my deare&s;t Life, to ju&s;tify my joy by your <HI>ap|parent</HI> approbation. The world around you, lovelie&s;t of women, has been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee your <HI>Lovers;</HI> &s;hew them now the hu&s;band of your choice.</P>
<P>O Sir! you have given me a motive! I will think of it throughout the whole Sacred Tran&s;action. She looked around her, as if to &s;ee if every-body were ready that moment to attend her to Church.</P>
<P>Lady G.] The Ceremony is happily over; and I am retired to oblige my Caroline. You have the form of the Proce&s;&s;ion. When ever-thing was ready, Mr. Selby thought fit to call us down in order into the Great Hall, according to it, mar&s;halling his Fours; and great pride and plea&s;ure did he take in his office. At his fir&s;t &s;ummons, down came the Angel, and the four young Ladies, and each of the four had her part|ner a&s;&s;igned her.</P>
<P>Emily &s;eemed, between the novelty and the parade, to be wholly engaged.</P>
<P>Harriet, the moment &s;he came down, flew to her grandmamma, and kneeled to her, Sir Charles &s;up|porting her as &s;he kneeled, and as &s;he aro&s;e. A tender and &s;weet fight!</P>
<P>The old Lady threw her arms about her, and twice or thrice ki&s;&s;ed her forehead; her voice faltring&mdash;God ble&s;s, ble&s;s, &s;u&s;tain my child!&mdash;Her aunt ki&s;&s;ing her cheek. Now, now, my deare&s;t Love, whi&s;pered &s;he, I call upon you for fortitude.</P>
<P>She vi&s;ibly &s;truggled for re&s;olution, but &s;eemed, in all her motions, to be in a hurry, as if afraid &s;he &s;hould not hold it. She pa&s;&s;ed me with &s;uch a &s;weet confu&s;ion! Charming girl! &s;aid I, taking her hand,
<PB N="324" REF="325">
as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, and giving way to her quick motions for fear re&s;traint &s;hould di&s;concert her.</P>
<P>When her uncle gave the word for moving, and approached to take her hand, &s;he in her hurry, for|getting her cue, put it into Sir Charles's. Hold, hold &s;aid her uncle, &s;weeping his bo&s;om with his chin, in his arch way, that mu&s;t not yet be. My brother, ki&s;&s;ing her hand, pre&s;ented it in a very gallant manner to her uncle. I yield it to you, Sir, &s;aid he, as a pre|cious tru&s;t; in an hour's time to be confimred mine by Divine, as well as human Sanctions.</P>
<P>Mr. Selby led the lovely creature to the coach, but &s;topt at the door with her, for Mrs. Shirley's going in fir&s;t: The &s;ervants at di&s;tance all admiring, and ble&s;&s;|ing, and praying, for their beloved young Lady.</P>
<P>Sir Charles took the good Mrs. Shirley's hand in one of his, and put the other arm round her wai&s;t, to &s;upport her. What honour you do me, Sir! &s;aid &s;he. I think I may throw away <HI>this</HI> (meaning her ebony crutch-&s;tick): Do I ail any-thing? Her feet, however, &s;econded not her &s;pirits. My brother lifted her into the coach. It was &s;o natural to him to be po|lite, that he offered his hand to his beloved Harriet; but was checked by her uncle (in his u&s;ual plea&s;ant manner): Stay your time, too ready Sir, &s;aid he. Thank God it will not be &s;o long before <HI>both</HI> hands will be yours.</P>
<P>We all followed, very exactly, the order that had been, with &s;o much proud parade, pre&s;cribed by Earl|mar&s;hal Selby.</P>
<P>The coach-way was lined with &s;pectators. Mr. Selby, it &s;eems, bowed all the way, in return to the &s;alutes of his acquaintance. Have you never, Lady L. called for the attention of your company in your coach, to &s;omething that has pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;treets, or on the road, and at the &s;ame time thru&s;t your head through the windows &s;o that nobody could &s;ee but your&s;elf? So it was with Mr. Selby, I doubt not.
<PB N="325" REF="326">
He wanted every one to look in at the Happy Pair; but took care that hardly any-body but him&s;elf &s;hould be &s;een. I a&s;ked him afterwards, If it were not &s;o? He knew not, he &s;aid, but it might. I told him, he had a very jolly comely face to &s;hew, but no head. He does not &s;pare me: But true je&s;ts are not always the mo&s;t welcome. Tell a Lady of Forty, that &s;he is Sixty or Seventy, and &s;he will not be &s;o angry as if &s;he were gue&s;&s;ed to be Eight or Nine-and-thirty. The one nobody will believe; the other every-body. My Lord G. I can tell you, fares well in Mr. Selby's com|pany.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Lucy, my dear girl, take the pen&mdash;You don't know you &s;ay, what I wrote la&s;t&mdash;Read it, my girl&mdash;You have it&mdash;Take the pen; I want to be among them.'</Q></P>
<P>Lucy.] Lady G. mu&s;t have her je&s;t, whether in the right place, or not. Excu&s;e me, both Si&s;ters. How <HI>could</HI> &s;he, however, in a part &s;o intere&s;ting? She &s;ays, I mu&s;t give an account of the Proce&s;&s;ion, and &s;he will conduct them into the Church; I out of it. I cannot, &s;he &s;ays, after &s;o many wi&s;hes, &s;o many &s;u&s;pen&s;es, &s;o much expectation, before it came to this, be too mi|nute. Every woman's heart leaps, &s;he &s;ays, when a Wedding is de&s;cribed; and wi&s;hes to know all, <HI>how and about it.</HI> Your Lady&s;hip will know, that the&s;e words are Lady G's own: But what can I &s;ay of the Proce&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>The poor Harriet&mdash;Fie upon me&mdash;The rich Har|riet, was not &s;orry, I believe, that her uncle's head, now on this &s;ide, now on the other, in a manner, filled the Coach: but when it &s;topt at the Church|yard, an inclo&s;ed one, who&s;e walls keep off coaches near a &s;tone's throw from the Church-porch, then was my lovely cou&s;in put to it; e&s;pecially as her grand|mother walked &s;o &s;low. We were all out of our Coaches before the Father and the Bride entered the
<PB N="326" REF="327">
Porch. I &s;hould tell your Lady&s;hip, that the pa&s;&s;age from the entrance of the Church-yard to the Church is railed in. Every Sunday the croud (gathered to &s;ee the gentry go in and come out) are accu&s;tomed to be bounded by the&s;e rails and were the more content|edly &s;o now: The whole Church-yard &s;eemed one ma&s;s (but for that &s;eparating pa&s;&s;age) of living matter, di&s;tingui&s;hed only by &s;eparate heads; not a hat on the mens; pulled off, perhaps, by general con&s;ent, for the convenience of &s;eeing, more than from de&s;igned regard in <HI>that</HI> particular. But, in the main, never was there &s;uch &s;ilent re&s;pect &s;hewn, on the like occa&s;ion, by mortal mob. We all of us, Lady L. have the happine&s;s of being beloved by high and low.</P>
<P>But one pretty &s;pectacle it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s by. Four girls, tenants daughters, the elde&s;t not above Thirteen, appeared with neat wicker-ba&s;kets in their hands, filled with flowers of the &s;ea&s;on. Chearful way was made for them. As &s;oon as the Bride, and Father, and Sir Charles, and Mrs. Shirley, alighted, the&s;e pretty little Flora's, all dre&s;&s;ed in white, chap|lets of flowers for head-dre&s;&s;es, large no&s;egays in their bo&s;oms, white ribbands adorning their &s;tays and their ba&s;kets; &s;ome &s;treaming down, others tied round the handles in true-lover's knots; attended the company, two going before, two other here and there, and every-where, all &s;trewing flowers: A pretty thought of the tenants among them&s;elves. Sir Charles &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with them: Pretty dears he called them, to one of them.</P>
<P><HI>God</HI> ble&s;s you, and <HI>God</HI> ble&s;s you, was echoed from many mouths. Your brother's attention was chiefly employed on Mrs. Shirley, becau&s;e of her age and lamene&s;s. Here my good Lady G. perhaps would &s;top to remark upon the worthy nature of the Engli&s;h populace, when good characters attract their admira|tion; for even the populace took notice, how right a thing it was for the fine&s;t young Gentleman their eyes
<PB N="327" REF="328">
ever beheld, to take &s;uch care of &s;o good an old Lady. He <HI>de&s;erved</HI> to live to be old him&s;elf, one &s;aid: They would warrant, others &s;aid, that he was a &s;weet|temper'd man; and others, that he had a good heart. In the Proce&s;&s;ion one of us picked up one prai&s;e, an|other another. Tho' Lady G. Lady W. and the four Bride-maids, as well as the Lords, might have claimed high notice; yet not any of them received more than commendation: We were all con&s;idered but as Satel|lites to the Planetr that pa&s;&s;ed before us. What, in|deed, were more? But let me &s;ay, that Mrs. Shir|ley had her &s;hare in Reverence, as the lovely Couple had theirs in Admiration. But O how my dear cou&s;in was affected, when &s;he alighted from her uncle's coach!</P>
<P>The Churchwardens them&s;elves were &s;o complai|&s;ant as to &s;tand at the Church-door, and opened it, on the approach of the Bride, and her Nuptial Father. But all the pews near the Altar were, however, filled (one or two excepted, which &s;eemed to be left for the company) with Ladies and well-dre&s;&s;ed women of the neighbourhood: And tho' they &s;eemed to intend to &s;hut the doors after we had all got in, the Church was full of people. Mr. Selby was di&s;plea&s;ed, for his Niece's &s;ake; who trembling, could hardly walk up to the Altar. Sir Charles &s;eated <HI>his</HI> venerable charge on a covered bench on the left-&s;ide of the Altar; and by her, and on another covered bench on the right|&s;ide, without the rails, we all, but the Bride-maids and their partners, took our &s;eats. They &s;tood, the Men on the Bridegroom's &s;ide; the Maids on Har|riet's&mdash;Never&mdash;</P>
<P>Lady G.] <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Are you within the Church, Lucy?&mdash;You are, I prote&s;t. Let me read what you have done. Come, pretty well, pretty well.&mdash;You were going to prai&s;e my brother: Leave that to me. I have an excellent knack at it.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="329">
Never was man &s;o much, and &s;o de&s;ervedly, ad|mired. He &s;aw his Harriet wanted &s;upport and en|couragement. The Mini&s;ter &s;tood &s;u&s;pended, a few moments, as doubting whether &s;he would not faint. My deare&s;t Love, whi&s;pered Sir Charles, remember you are doing honour to the happy, thrice happy, man of your Choice: Shew he is your Choice, in the face of this Congregation. Pardon me, Sir! I will endea|vour to be all you wi&s;h me.</P>
<P>Sir Charles bowed to the Mini&s;ter to begin the Sa|cred Office. Mr. Selby, with all his bravery, trem|bled, and, overcome by the Solemnity of the Prepa|ration, looked now pale, now red. The whole Con|gregation were hu&s;hed and &s;ilent, as if nobody were in the Church but per&s;ons immediately concerned to be there. Emily changed colour frequently. She had her handkerchief in her hand; and (pretty enough!) her &s;i&s;ter Bride-maids, little thinking that Emily had a rea&s;on for her emotion, which none of them had, pulled out <HI>their</HI> handkerchiefs too, and <HI>permitted</HI> a gentle tear or two to &s;teal down their glowing cheeks. I fixed my eye on Emily, &s;itting outward, to keep her in order. The Doctor began&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'<HI>Dearly Beloved</HI>'</Q>&mdash;Ah, Harriet! thought I; thou art much quieter now, than once thou wert at the&s;e words <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">When Sir Hargrave Pollexfen would have compelled her to be his, Vol. I. p. 216.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No <HI>impediments</HI> were confe&s;&s;ed by either of the par|ties, when they were referred to by the Mini&s;ter, on this head.

<P>Sir Charles, with a joy that lighted up a more charming flu&s;h than u&s;ual on his face, his lively Soul looking out at his fine eyes, yet with an air as mode&s;t as re&s;pectful, did credit to our Sex before the applaud|ing multitude, by bending his knee to his &s;weet Bride, on taking her Hand, and &s;aluting her, on the conclu|&s;ion of the ceremony&mdash;May God, my deare&s;t Life, &s;aid he, audibly, be gracious to <HI>your</HI> Grandi&s;on, as he will be good to <HI>his</HI> Harriet, now no more Byron!&mdash;She courte&s;ied low, and with &s;o mode&s;t a grace, that every &s;oul ble&s;&s;ed her; and pronounced her the lovelie&s;t of women, and him the mo&s;t graceful and polite of men.</P>

<P>Crouds of people lined the way, in our return from Church, as well as in our way to it; and ble&s;&s;ings were pronounced upon the Happy Pair, by hundreds, at their alighting at Selby-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When we were all a&s;&s;embled in the Great Hall, mutual congratulations flowed from every mouth: Then did every man &s;alute the happy, happy Bride: Then did the equally-happy Bridegroom &s;alute every Lady&mdash;There was among us the height of joy; joy becoming the awful Solemnity; and every one was full of the decency and delight which were given and &s;hewn by the crouds of &s;pectators of all ranks, and both Sexes; a delight and decency worthy of the cha|racters of the admirable Pair: And Mi&s;s Nedham declared, and all the young Ladies joined with her, that if &s;he could be &s;ecure of the like good beha|viour and encouragement, &s;he would never think of a Private Wedding for her&s;elf. Mr. Selby him&s;elf was overjoyed too much, even to utter a je&s;t! Now, now, he &s;aid, he had attained the height of his ambition.</P>
<P>The dear Harriet <HI>could</HI> look up: She <HI>could</HI> &s;mile around her. I led her, with Lucy, into the Cedar|parlour&mdash;Now, my dear Love, &s;aid I, the moment we entered it, throwing my arms about her, ju&s;t as her lips were joyfully opening to &s;peak to me, do I &s;alute my real Si&s;ter, my Si&s;ter Grandi&s;on, in my dear Lady L's name, as well as in my own: God Al|mighty confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h your happine&s;s!</P>

<P>Lucy went out, and led in the &s;weet girl. With hands and eyes uplifted, My dear Mi&s;s Byron, that was, now Lady Grandi&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, love me; love your Emily. I am now <HI>your</HI> Emily, <HI>your</HI> Ward; love me as well as you did when Mi&s;s Byron.</P>

<P>Sir Charles entred; his Beauchamp in his hand. Quitting his, and taking hers, he ki&s;&s;ed it. Once more, &s;aid he, do I thank my deare&s;t Life for the ho|nour &s;he has done me: Then re&s;uming, with his other hand, his Beauchamp's, he pre&s;ented each to the other, as Brother and Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>Beauchamp, in a graceful manner, bowed on her hand: She courtefied to him with an air of dignity and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>He then turning to Emily; Acknowlege, my dear, &s;aid he, your elder Si&s;ter: My Harriet will love her Emily. Receive, my deare&s;t Life, your Ward. Yet (to Emily) I acquit not my&s;elf of the power, any more than of the will, of obliging you at fir&s;t hand.</P>
<P>O Sir! &s;aid the &s;obbing girl, you are all goodne&s;s! But I will make no reque&s;t to you, but through my deare&s;t Lady Grandi&s;on's mediation. If &s;he approve of it fir&s;t, I &s;hall not doubt of its fitne&s;s to be com|plied with.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="338">
Was not that pretty, in Emily?&mdash;O how Beau|champ's eyes loved her!</P>
<P>But why, Ladies, &s;aid Sir Charles, do you &s;eque&s;ter your&s;elves from the company? Are we not all of a Family to-day? The four little Flora's, with their ba&s;kets in their hands, were entering the gate, as I came in: Receive them, my Love, with your u&s;ual graciou&s;ne&s;s. We will join the company, and call them in. My Beauchamp, you are a Brideman; re|&s;tore my Bride to her friends and admirers within.</P>
<P>He took Emily's hand. She looked <HI>&s;o</HI> proud!&mdash;Harriet gave hers to Beauchamp. We followed them into the Great Hall: Mr. Selby had archne&s;s in his look, and &s;eemed ready to blame us for withdraw|ing.&mdash;Sir Charles was aware of him. My dear Mr. Selby, &s;aid he, Will you not allow us to &s;ee the pretty Flora's&mdash;By all means, &s;aid Mr. Selby; and hurried out, and introduced them. Sweet pretty girls! We had more lei&s;ure to con&s;ider the elegant ru&s;ticity of their dre&s;&s;es and appearance. They had their ba&s;kets in their hands, and a courte&s;y and a blu&s;h ready for every one in company. Sir Charles &s;eemed to expect that his Bride would take notice of them fir&s;t; but ob&s;erving that &s;he wanted pre&s;ence of mind, he &s;tept to them, took each by the hand, the younge&s;t fir&s;t, called them pretty Loves; I wi&s;h, &s;aid he, I could pre&s;ent you with as pretty flowers as you threw away in honour <HI>to this company;</HI> putting into each ba&s;ket, wrapped up in paper, five guineas: Then pre&s;ented them, two in each hand, to his Bride; who, by that time, was better prepared to receive them with that &s;weet ea&s;e and familiarity which give grace to all &s;he &s;ays and does.</P>
<P>The children afterwards de&s;iring to go to their pa|rents, the polite Beauchamp him elf, accompanied by Lucy, led them to them, and returned, with a reque&s;t from all the tenants, that they might have the honour, &s;ome time in the day, to &s;ee the Bride and Bridegroom
<PB N="338" REF="339">
among them, were it but for two minutes. What &s;ays my Love? &s;aid Sir Charles. O, Sir! I cannot, cannot&mdash;Well, then, I will attend them, to make your excu&s;e, as well as I can. She bowed her thanks.</P>
<P>The time before dinner was devoted to conver|&s;ation. Sir Charles was nobody's; no, not very par|ticularly his Bride's: He put every one upon &s;peaking in turn. For about half an hour he &s;at between the joyful Mrs. Shirley and Mrs. Selby; but even then, in talking to them, talked to the whole company: Yet, in his air and manner to both, &s;hewed &s;o much re&s;pect, as needed not the aid of a particular addre&s;s to them in words.</P>
<P>This was ob&s;erved to me by good Lord L. For Harriet (unea&s;y, every eye continually upon her, thoughtful, ba&s;hful) withdrawing, a little before din|ner, with a ca&s;t of her eye to me, I followed her to her dre&s;&s;ing-room. There, with &s;o much expre&s;&s;ive|ne&s;s of meaning, tho' not of language; &s;o much tenderne&s;s of love; &s;o much pious gratitude; &s;o much true virgin &s;en&s;ibility; did &s;he open her heart to me; that I &s;hall ever revolve what pa&s;&s;ed in that conver&s;ation, as the true criterion of Virgin Delicacy unmingled with Affectation. Nor was I di&s;plea&s;ed that, in the height of her grateful Self-congratulation, &s;he more than once acknowleged a &s;igh for the ad|mirable Clementina. We ju&s;t began to expre&s;s our plea&s;ure and our hopes in the good behaviour of our Emily, when we were called to dinner.</P>
<P>It was a &s;umptuous one.</P>
<P>Mr. Selby was very orderly, upon the whole: But he remembred, he &s;aid, that when <HI>he</HI> was married (and he called upon his Dame to confirm it) he was obliged to wait on his Bride, and the Company; and he in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that Sir Charles &s;hould.</P>
<P>No, no, no, every one &s;aid; and the Bride looked a little &s;erious upon it: But Sir Charles, with an air
<PB N="339" REF="340">
of gaiety that infinitely became him, took a napkin from the butler; and putting it under his arm, I have only one reque&s;t to make you, my dear Mr. Selby&mdash;When I am more aukward than I ought to be, do you correct me: and I &s;hall have both pride and plea&s;ure in the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Adad! &s;aid Mr. Selby, looking at him with plea|&s;ure&mdash;You may <HI>be</HI> any-thing, <HI>do</HI> any-thing; you cannot conceal the Gentleman. Ads-heart, you mu&s;t always be the fir&s;t man in company&mdash;Pardon me, my Lords.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was the mode&s;te&s;t &s;ervitor that ever waited at table, while his napkin was under his arm: But he laid it down, While he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the company, finding &s;omething to &s;ay to each in his pithy, agreeable manner, as he went round the table. He made every one happy. With what delight did the elder Ladies look upon him, when he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to each of them! He &s;topt at the Bride's chair, and made her a compliment with an air of tenderne&s;s. I heard not what it was, &s;itting at di|&s;tance; but &s;he looked grateful, plea&s;ed; &s;miled, and blu&s;hed. He pa&s;&s;ed from her to the Bride-maids, and again complimented each of them. They al&s;o &s;eemed delighted with what he &s;aid. Then going to Mr. Selby; Why don't you bid me re&s;ume the napkin, Sir?&mdash;No, no; we &s;ee what you can do: Your con|formity is enough for me. You may now &s;it down, when you plea&s;e. You make the waiters look auk|ward.</P>
<P>He took his &s;eat, thanked Mr. Selby for having re|minded him of his duty, as he called it, and was all Him&s;elf, the mo&s;t graceful and obliging of men.</P>
<P>You know, my dear Lady L. how much I love to prai&s;e my brother. Neither I, nor the young Ladies, not even tho&s;e who had humble &s;ervants pre&s;ent, re|garded any-body but him. My poor Lord!&mdash;I am glad, however, that he has a tolerable good &s;et of
<PB N="340" REF="341">
teeth&mdash;They were always vi&s;ible. A good hone&s;t &s;ort of man, tho', Lady L. whatever you may think of him.</P>
<P>After dinner, at Mr. Selby's reminding motion, Sir Charles and the men went to the tenants. They all wi&s;hed him joy; and, as they would not &s;it down, while he &s;tood, Sir Charles took a &s;eat among them, and all the re&s;t followed his example.</P>
<P>One of the hone&s;t men, it &s;eems, remembred the Nuptials of Mr. and Mrs. Byron, and prai&s;ed them as the be&s;t and happie&s;t of the human race: Others confirmed <HI>his</HI> character of both: Another knew the late Mr. Shirley, and extolled him as much: Another remembred the birth, another the chri&s;tening, of the Bride; and others talked of what an excellent creature &s;he was from her infancy. Let me tell you, Sir, &s;aid one grey-headed man, you will have much ado to de&s;erve her; and yet you are &s;aid to be as good as you are hand&s;ome. The women took up the cau&s;e: They were &s;ure, by what they had heard, if any man in the world could de&s;erve the Bride, it was Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; and they would &s;wear for him by his looks. One of the hone&s;t men &s;aid, they &s;hould all have taken it as an <HI>hugeous</HI> favour, were they allowed to wi&s;h the Bride joy, tho' at ever &s;o great a <HI>di&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;aid, He was &s;ure the women would excu&s;e her this day; and then the men would, in complai&s;ance to them. We will hope, &s;aid he, look|ing all round him, before we leave Northampton|&s;hire, for one happy dinner together.</P>
<P>They all got up to bow and courte&s;y, and looked upon each other; and the men, who are mo&s;t of them freeholders, wi&s;hed to the Lord for a new election, and that he would come among them. They had no great matter of fault to find, they &s;aid, with their pre&s;ent repre&s;entatives: but any-body who would oppo&s;e Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, would &s;tand no chance. The women joined in the declaration, as if
<PB N="341" REF="342">
they thought highly, as Sir Charles plea&s;antly ob|&s;erved, of their own influence over their hu&s;bands. They all wondered that he was not in Parliament, till they heard how little a while he had been in Eng|land.</P>
<P>He took leave of the good people (who, by their behaviour and appearance, did as much credit to their landlords as to them&s;elves) with his u&s;ual affability and politene&s;s; repeating his promi&s;e of a day of Ju|bilee, as &s;ome of them called it.</P>
<P>The Ball, at the reque&s;t of the whole company, was opened by the Bride and Bridegroom. She was very unea&s;y at the general Call. Sir Charles &s;aw &s;he was, and would have taken out Mi&s;s Nedham; but it was not permitted. the dear creature, I believe, did her be&s;t at the time; but I have &s;een her perform better: Yet &s;he did exceedingly well. But &s;uch a figure her&s;elf, and &s;uch a partner; How could &s;he do ami&s;s?</P>
<P>Emily was taken out by Beauchamp. He did his be&s;t, I am &s;ure; and almo&s;t as much excelled his pretty partner, as his beloved friend did his.</P>
<P>Emily, &s;itting down by me, a&s;ked if &s;he did not perform very ill. Not <HI>very</HI> ill, my dear, &s;aid I; but not &s;o well as I have &s;een you dance. I don't know, &s;aid &s;he, what ails me: My heart is very heavy. madam. What can be the meaning of it? But don't tell Lady Grandi&s;on &s;o.&mdash;High-ho!&mdash;Lady Grandi&s;on! What a &s;ound is that? A charming &s;ound! But how &s;hall I bring my lips to be famili|arized to it?</P>
<P>You are glad &s;he is married, my love, I dare &s;ay?</P>
<P>Glad! To be &s;ure I am! It is an event that I have long, long wi&s;hed for: But new names, and new ti|tles, one knows not how to frame one's mouth to pre&s;ently. It was &s;ome time before I could call you

Lady G. But don't you pity poor Lady Clementina, a little, madam?</P>
<P>A great deal, I do. But as &s;he refu&s;ed my bro|ther&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah! dear! that's the thing! I wonder &s;he could&mdash;when he would have let her have the free exerci&s;e of her Religion.</P>
<P>Had you rather your Guardian had had Lady Cle|mentina, Emily?</P>
<P>O no! How can you a&s;k me &s;uch a que&s;tion, madam? Of all the women in the world, I wi&s;hed him to have Mi&s;s Byron. But &s;he is too happy for pity, you know, madam!&mdash;Ble&s;s me! What does &s;he look &s;o thoughtful for? Why does &s;he &s;igh &s;o? Surely &s;he can't be &s;orry!</P>
<P>Sorry! No, my Love! But a change of condition for life! New attachments! A new cour&s;e of life! Her name &s;unk, and lo&s;t! The property, per&s;on and will, of another, excellent as the man is; obliged to go to a new hou&s;e; to be ingrafted into a new fa|mily; to leave her own, who &s;o dearly love her; an <HI>irrevocable</HI> de&s;tiny!&mdash;Do you think, Emily, new in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; every eye upon her: it is not enough to make a con&s;iderate mind, as hers is, thoughtful!</P>

Did your Lady&s;hip ever &s;ee &s;o &s;weet a creature? I never did.</P>
<P>Not for Beauty, Dignity, Ea&s;e, Figure, Mode&s;ty, good Sen&s;e, did I ever.</P>
<P>She is my <HI>Guardiane&s;s,</HI> may I &s;ay? Is there &s;uch a word?&mdash;I &s;hall be as proud of her, as I am of my Guardian. Yet there is no cau&s;e of &s;ighing, I think!&mdash;See my Guardian! her Hu&s;band? Unfa&s;hionable

See how every young Lady eyes him; every young Gentleman endeavours to imitate him. I wi&s;h <HI>he</HI> would take me out: I would do better.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of the whi&s;pering Dialogue that pa&s;&s;ed between Emily and me&mdash;Poor girl!</P>
<P>Mr. Selby danced with Lucy, and got great ap|plau&s;e. He was re&s;olved, he &s;aid, to have one dance with the Bride. She be&s;ought him not to think of it. Her grandmamma, her aunt, intreated for her. She de&s;ired Sir Charles to interpo&s;e&mdash;If, my deare&s;t Life, you <HI>could</HI> oblige your uncle&mdash;I cannot, cannot think of it, &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Lady G. &s;aid Sir Charles, be &s;o good as to chal|lenge Mr. Selby. I &s;tood forth, and offered my hand to him. He could not refu&s;e it. He did not perform &s;o well as he did with Lucy. Go, &s;aid I, when we had d ne, &s;it down by your Dame, and be quiet: You have lo&s;t all your credit. <HI>You</HI> dance with a Bride!&mdash;Some people know not how to bear applau&s;e; nor to leave off when they are well. Lord L. took out Mrs. Selby. She dances very gracefully. My Lord, you know, is above prai&s;e. The young Lord Rere&s;by and Mi&s;s Nedham di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves. <HI>My</HI> odd creature was in his element. He and Mi&s;s Barclay, and another time he and Emily, did very hand&s;omely; and the girl got up her reputation. Lord W. did hobble, and not ungracefully, with old Mrs. Selby; who had not danced, &s;he &s;aid, for twenty years before; but on &s;o joyful an occa&s;ion, would not refu&s;e Lord W's challenge: And both were applauded; the time of life of the Lady, the limpingne&s;s of my Lord, con|&s;idered.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="345">
There was a very plentiful &s;ideboard, of rich wines, &s;weetmeats, &amp;c. We all di&s;claimed formal &s;upper.</P>
<P>We went afterwards into country dances. Mrs. Shirley retired about Ten. Harriet took the oppor|tunity of attending her; and it was a &s;ea&s;onable relief to her. I had an intimation to attend her. I found her ju&s;t dropt on her knees to her grandmamma; who, with her arms about her neck, was folding to her fond heart the darling of it. The &s;weet girl was <HI>&s;o</HI> apprehen&s;ive! I was called upon to give my opi|nion, whether &s;he &s;hould return to the company, or not: I gave it, that &s;he &s;hould; and that &s;he &s;hould only retire, for the night, about Eleven. As to the Bride-maids, I &s;aid, I would manage, that they &s;hould only attend her to her chamber, and leave her there, with her aunt, Lucy, and me. Lord L. undertook to make the gentlemen give up form; which, he &s;aid, they would the more ea&s;ily do, as they were &s;et into dancing.</P>
<P>After all, Lady L. we women, dre&s;&s;ed out in rib|bands, and gaudy trappings, and in Virgin-white, on our Wedding-days, &s;eem but like milk-white heifers led to &s;acrifice. We ought to be indulged, if we are not &s;hamele&s;s things, and very wrong indeed, in our choice of the man we <HI>can</HI> love.</P>
<P>We returned to company. The Bridegroom was looking out for us. My deare&s;t Life, &s;aid he, Are you returned?&mdash;I thought&mdash;There he &s;topt.</P>
<P>Mr. Selby broke from his partner, Mi&s;s Barclay, to whi&s;k into the figure the Bride. Sir Charles joined the de&s;erted Lady, who &s;eemed much better plea&s;ed with her new partner than with her old one. Lord W. who was &s;itting down, took Mrs. Selby, and led her into the dance.</P>
<P>I drew Mi&s;s Nedham to the &s;ideboard, and gave her her cue: She gave theirs to the three other Bride-maids.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="346">
About Eleven, Mrs. Selby, unob&s;erved, withdrew with the Bride. The Bride-maids, one by one, waited on her to her chamber; &s;aluted her, and re|turned to company.</P>
<P>The dear creature wanted pre&s;ence of mind. She fell into my reflexion above. O my dear Lady G! &s;aid &s;he, was I not right when I declared, that I never would marry, were it not to the man I loved above all the men in the world?</P>
<P>She complimented me twenty times, with being very good. She prayed for me; but her prayers were meant for her&s;elf. You remember, that &s;he told me, on my apprehen&s;ivene&s;s on the like occa&s;ion, that fear made me loving to her. On her ble&s;&s;ing me, Ah, Harriet, &s;aid I, you now find, that apprehen&s;ion will make one <HI>pious,</HI> as well as <HI>loving.</HI></P>
<P>My Si&s;ter, my Friend, my own, my Caroline's, my Brother's, <HI>dear</HI> Lady Grandi&s;on! &s;aid I, when I left her, near undre&s;&s;ed, God ble&s;s you! And God be prai&s;ed, that I can call you by the&s;e tender names! My Brother is the happie&s;t of men; You of women. May we never love each other le&s;s than we do now. Look forward to the &s;erene happine&s;s of your future lot. If you are the Joy of our Brother, you mu&s;t be our Joy; and the Jewel of our Family.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered me only by a fervent embrace, her eyes lifted up, &s;urcharged, as I may &s;ay, with tears of joy, as in thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>I then ru&s;hed down-&s;tairs, and into the company.</P>
<P>My brother in&s;tantly addre&s;&s;ed me&mdash;My Har|riet, whi&s;pered he, with impatience, returns not this night.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee Mrs. Selby, I pre&s;ume, by-and-by, re|turned I.</P>
<P>He took his &s;eat by old Mrs. Selby, and fell into talk with her, to avoid joining in the dances. His eye was continually turned to the door. Mrs. Selby,
<PB N="346" REF="347">
at la&s;t, came in. Her eyes &s;hewed the tender leave &s;he had taken of her Harriet.</P>
<P>My brother approached her. She went out: He followed her. In a quarter of an hour &s;he returned.</P>
<P>We &s;aw my brother no more that night.</P>
<P>We continued our dancings till between Three and Four.</P>
<P>I have often ob&s;erved, that we women, whether weakly or robu&s;t, are hardly ever tired with dancing. It was &s;o with us. The men, poor &s;ouls! looked &s;illy, and &s;leepy, by two; all but my ape: He has a good many <HI>Femalities,</HI> as uncle Selby calls them. But he was brought up to be idle and u&s;ele&s;s, as women generally are. I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> conclude my Letters whim&s;i|cally, my dear: If I did not, you would not know them to be written by</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>EMILY, Lucy, and I, went to pay our morn|ing-congratulations as &s;oon as we aro&s;e, which was not very early, to my brother, being told that he was in the Cedar parlour, writing. He received us like him&s;elf. I am writing, &s;aid he, a few very &s;hort Letters. They are to demand the felicitations, one, of our beloved Caroline; one of our aunt Gran|di&s;on; one of the Earl of G. and one of our dear Dr. Bartlett. There is another; you may read it, Charlotte.</P>
<P>That al&s;o was a &s;hort one; to &s;ignify, according to promi&s;e, as I found, to Signor Jeronymo della Por|retta, the actual celebration of his Nuptials. I re|turned it&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Like my brother,'</Q> was all I &s;aid. It concluded with a caution, given in the mo&s;t ardent
<PB N="347" REF="348">
terms, again&s;t precipitating the admirable Clemen|tina.</P>
<P>We went up to the Bride. She was dre&s;&s;ing. Her aunt was with her, and her two cou&s;in Holles's, who went not home the preceding night.</P>
<P>The moment we entered, &s;he ran to us; and, cla&s;ping her arms about my neck, hid her blu&s;hing face in my bo&s;om&mdash;My deare&s;t, deare&s;t Lady G. mur|mured &s;he&mdash;Am I indeed your Si&s;ter, your Si&s;ter Grandi&s;on? And will you love me as well as ever?</P>
<P>My deare&s;t, lovely Si&s;ter! My own Si&s;ter Gran|di&s;on! My Brother's Wife! Mo&s;t &s;incerely do I re|peat, Joy, Joy, Joy, to my Harriet!</P>
<P>O Lady G! How you rai&s;e me! Your goodne&s;s is a &s;ea&s;onable goodne&s;s to me! I never, never, but by yours and your &s;i&s;ter's example, &s;hall be worthy of your brother!</P>
<P>Then di&s;engaging her&s;elf from my arms; Ye&s;ter|day, Lucy, &s;aid &s;he, was a happy, happy Day! I have but one, one regret&mdash;There is a Lady in the world that de&s;erves the be&s;t of men better than your Harriet&mdash;And, lifting up her hands and eyes, God pre|&s;erve and protect her!&mdash;She &s;hall be the &s;ubject of my prayers, as often as I pray for my&s;elf, and for him who is dearer to me than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Then embracing Emily; Wi&s;h me Joy, my Love! In <HI>my</HI> Joy &s;hall you find <HI>your own!</HI></P>
<P>Emily wept, and even &s;obbed&mdash;You mu&s;t, you mu&s;t, treat me le&s;s kindly, madam. I cannot, cannot bear your good&mdash;your goodne&s;s. On my knees I acknowlege my other Guardian. God ble&s;s my dear, dear Lady Grandi&s;on!</P>
<P>At that moment, as they were folded in each other's arms, entered my brother&mdash;He cla&s;ped his round his &s;weet Bride; pardon this intru&s;ion, &s;aid he&mdash;Excellent creature, continue to love my Emily!&mdash;Continue, my dear Emily, to de&s;erve the &s;i&s;terly love of my Harriet!</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="349">
Then turning to me, &s;aluting me, My Charlotte loves my Harriet; &s;o does our Caroline. She fondly loves you both. God continue your love to each other! What Si&s;ters has Ye&s;terday's happy event given to each other!&mdash;What a Wife to me!&mdash;We will endeavour, my Love (to her) to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> our hap|pine&s;s; and, I humbly tru&s;t, it will be continued to us.</P>
<P>He &s;aluted Mrs. Selby&mdash;My own Aunt Selby! What obligations am I under to you, and to our ve|nerable Mrs. Shirley, for giving to an Angel an An|gel's education, and conferring on <HI>me</HI> the ble&s;&s;ing!</P>
<P>Congratulate me, my dear Cou&s;in Holles's, &s;aluting each. May you both be as happy, whenever you alter your &s;ingle &s;tate, as I will endeavour to make your lovely Cou&s;in!</P>
<P>He withdrew, bowing to us, and with &s;o much re|&s;pectfulne&s;s to the happy Harriet, as delighted us all.</P>
<P>Lucy went down with him, to pay her morning compliments to the two Grandmamma's.</P>
<P>Si&s;ter, &s;aid Kitty Holles, after he was gone&mdash;we never, never, can think of marrying, after we have &s;een Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, and his behaviour.</P>
<P>Lucy came up with Nancy. They embraced their cou&s;in. Your grandmamma and my grandmamma, my deare&s;t cou&s;in, are impatient to &s;ee you, in <HI>your</HI> grandmamma's chamber; and the gentlemen are cry|ing out for their breakfa&s;ts in the great parlour. We hurried down. The Bride threw her&s;elf at her grand|mamma's feet, for her ble&s;&s;ing. It was given in &s;uch a tender and pious manner, that we were all affected by it. The be&s;t of Sons, of Men, &s;aid &s;he, after|wards, has but ju&s;t left me. What a ble&s;&s;ing to all around him, is a good man! Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is every-thing. But, my dear Loves, to the younger Ladies, Let a good man, let life, let manners, be the principal motive of your choice: In <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> will you have every &s;anction; and your Fathers, Mothers, Re|lations,
<PB N="349" REF="350">
Friends, every joy! My deare&s;t Love, my Harriet, taking her hand, there was a time that I thought no man on earth could de&s;erve you: Now it is my prayer, and will be, that you may de&s;erve this man. But let us join the gentlemen. Fear not, my Harriet&mdash;Sir Charles's character will pre&s;erve with every one its dignity, and give a &s;anction to the &s;o|lemnity that has united you to him. My deare&s;t Love! be proud, and look a&s;&s;ured: <HI>You</HI> may, or who can? Ye&s;terday's tran&s;action is your Glory; glory in it, my Harriet!</P>
<P>We attended the two elder Ladies down. Harriet, as ba&s;hful people ever do, increa&s;ed her own difficul|ties, by &s;taying behind with her Lucy. We were all &s;eated at the breakfa&s;t-tables, and &s;taid for them: Mr. Selby grew impatient; every one having declared them&s;elves ready for breakfa&s;t. At la&s;t, down came the blu&s;hing Bride, with her Lucy. Sir Charles &s;ee|ing Mr. Selby's countenance turning peevi&s;hly arch; ju&s;t as he had begun <Q REND="inline">'Let me tell you, Niece,'</Q> and was coming out with &s;omething, he aro&s;e, and taking his Bride's hand, led her to her &s;eat. Hu&s;h, my dear Mr. Selby, &s;aid he; Nobody mu&s;t call to account my Wi&s;e, and I pre&s;ent.&mdash;How, Sir! How, Sir! Already have I lo&s;t my Niece?</P>
<P>Not &s;o, Mr. Selby. All her duties will have &s;trength given them by the happy event of ye&s;terday: But you mu&s;t not let a new-married man &s;ee how much ea&s;ier it is to find fault than to be faultle&s;s.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Sir! replied Mr. Selby&mdash;You'll one day pay for your complai&s;ance, or my Niece is not a woman. But I was ready primed. You have robbed me of a je&s;t; and that, let me tell you, would have been more to me than my breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, Lucy gave us a le&s;&s;on on the harp|&s;ichord. Sir Charles accompanied her finger, at the de&s;ire of the company.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady W. excu&s;ed them&s;elves to breakfa&s;t,
<PB N="350" REF="351">
but came to dinner. We entertained one another with reports of what pa&s;&s;ed ye&s;terday; what people &s;aid; how the tenants fea&s;t was managed; how the populace behaved at the hou&s;es which were kept open. The Churchwardens Li&s;t was produced of the Poor recommended by them: It amounted to upwards of 140, divided into two cla&s;&s;es; one of the acknow|leged poor, the other of poor hou&s;ekeepers and la|bouring people who were a&s;hamed to apply; but to whom the Churchwardens knew bounty would be ac|ceptable. There were above thirty of the&s;e, to whom Sir Charles gave very hand&s;omely, but we knew not what. The Churchwardens, who are known to be good men, went away ble&s;&s;ing him, with hearts run|ning over at their lips, as if they them&s;elves were to find their account in his goodne&s;s.</P>

<P>WE have had a &s;mart debate this morning, on the natural independency of our Sex, and the u&s;urpation of the other. Particulars by-and-by.</P>
<P>My brother is an irre&s;i&s;table man. To-morrow he has carried it to make his appearance at Church, again&s;t all their fir&s;t intentions, and that by their own con&s;ents. He had con&s;idered every-thing: They had not. Mr. Beauchamp has Letters which require him to go up to town: Lord and Lady W. are de&s;irous to get thither; my Lord having &s;ome gouty warnings: I am obliged to go up; having hated to &s;et about any|thing preparatory to your ca&s;e, Caroline! [If the wretch were to come in my way ju&s;t now, I &s;hould throw my &s;tandi&s;h at him, I believe.] The Earl and Lady Gertrude are in town; and I am afraid of another reprimand. The Earl never je&s;ts but he means the &s;ame as if he were &s;erious. I &s;hall take Emily with me, when I go. Mrs. Reeves wants to be with her little boy. Yet all the&s;e people are de|&s;irous to credit the appearance.&mdash;I had like to have forgot your good man&mdash;He longs to &s;ee his Caroline;
<PB N="351" REF="352">
and hopes to engage my brother to &s;tand in per&s;on as his urchin's &s;pon&s;or. So you &s;ee that there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity to con&s;ent to make the appearance to-morrow, or the Bride will lo&s;e the flower of her company.</P>
<P>On Monday it &s;tands determined, that Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, Mr. Beauchamp, Emily, Lord L. Lord and Lady W. my&s;elf, and Lord G. will &s;et out for London.</P>
<P>God continue the happine&s;s of this charming Pair! Their behaviour to each other is ju&s;t what I would wi&s;h it to be; tender, affectionate, without ful&s;ome fondne&s;s, He cannot be more re&s;pectful to the dear creature now, than he was before marriage: But from his pre&s;ent behaviour, I dare an&s;wer for him, that he will not be le&s;s &s;o: And yet he is &s;o lively, that he has all the <HI>young man</HI> in his behaviour, whenever oc|ca&s;ions call for relaxation; even when &s;ubjects require &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, as they do &s;ometimes, in conver&s;ations be|tween Mrs. Shirley, Mrs. Selby, Mr. Deane, and him; his &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, as Mrs. Shirley her&s;elf finely ob&s;erved in his ab&s;ence, is attended with &s;uch vivacity, and intermingled with &s;uch entertaining illu&s;trations, all naturally ari&s;ing from and falling into the &s;ubject, that he is &s;ure of every one's attention and admi|ration. The features of his manly face, and the turn of his fine eye, ob&s;erved &s;he, on another occa&s;ion, are <HI>ca&s;t</HI> for pity, and not for cen&s;ure.

<P>THE debate I mentioned, began on Friday morn|ing at breakfa&s;t-time; brought on by &s;ome of uncle Selby's good-natured particularities; for he will always have &s;omething to &s;ay again&s;t women. I be|&s;poke my brother's neutrality, and declared I would enter the li&s;ts with Mr. Selby, and allow all the other men pre&s;ent to be of his &s;ide. I had a flow of &s;pirits. Man's u&s;urpation, and woman's natural independency, was the topic. I carried on my argument very tri|umphantly: Now-and-then a &s;ly hint, popt out by my brother, half-di&s;concerted me; but I called him to order, and he was &s;ilent: Yet once he had like to have put me out&mdash;Wrapping his arms about him&s;elf, with inimitable humour&mdash;O my Charlotte, &s;aid he, how I love my country; ENGLAND is the <HI>only</HI> &s;pot in the world, in which this argument <HI>can</HI> be properly de|bated!&mdash;Very &s;ly&mdash;Was it not?</P>

All tho&s;e, however, were men of &s;traw with me; and I thought my&s;elf very near making Mr. Selby a&s;k par|don of his Dame for his thirty years u&s;urpation. In &s;hort, I had half-e&s;tabli&s;hed our Sex's &s;uperiority on the ruin of that of the &s;orry fellows, when the debate was clo&s;ed, and referred to Mrs. Shirley, as mode|ratrix; my brother &s;till excluded any &s;hare in it.&mdash;She indeed obliged me to lower my top&s;ails a little.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I think, &s;aid the venerable Lady, women are ge|nerally too much con&s;idered as a &s;pecies apart.

Nay, I am &s;o much of this opinion, that tho' I think the confidence which &s;ome men place in their wives, in committing all their affairs to their care, very flattering to the opi|nion both of their integrity and capacity; yet I &s;hould not choo&s;e (and that not out of lazine&s;s to avoid the trouble) to interfere with the management without doors, which I think more properly the man's province, unle&s;s in &s;ome particular ca&s;es.</Q></P>

I remember, that my Harriet di&s;tingui&s;hes very properly, in &s;ome of her Letters to her Lucy, between <HI>Language</HI> and <HI>Science;</HI> and that poor Mr. Walden (that I think was his name) was pretty much di&s;concerted, as a pedant may &s;ometimes be, when (and he bowed to his Harriet) he has a <HI>natural genius</HI> to contend with.

<P><HI>Correct</HI> you, my deare&s;t Life!&mdash;What a word is that? I remember, that, in the conver&s;ation in which you were obliged, again&s;t your will, to bear &s;o con|&s;iderable a part, you demon&s;trated, that genius, with|out deep learning, made a much more &s;hining figure in conver&s;ation, than learning without genius: But, upon the whole, I was a little apprehen&s;ive, that true learning might &s;uffer, if languages were too &s;lightly treated. Mr. Walden made one good ob&s;ervation, or rather remembred it, for it was long ago made, and will be always of weight, that the knowlege of lan|guages,
<PB N="358" REF="359">
any more than the advantage of birth, was never thought lightly of by tho&s;e who had preten&s;ions to either. The knowlege of the Latin language, in particular, let me &s;ay, is of &s;ingular u&s;e in the ma&s;tery of every &s;cience.</P>
<P>There are who aver, that men of parts have no occa&s;ion for learning: But, &s;urely, our Shake&s;peare him&s;elf, one of the greate&s;t genius's of any country or age (who, however, is an adept in the &s;uperior learn|ing, the knowlege of nature) would not have been a &s;ufferer, had he had that greater &s;hare of human learn|ing which is denied him by &s;ome critics.</P>
<P>But, Sir Charles, &s;aid Mr. Deane, don't you think that Shake&s;peare, who lived before the great Milton, has an ea&s;ier, plea&s;anter, and more intelligible man|ner of writing, than Milton? If &s;o, may it not be owing to Milton's greater learning, that Shake&s;peare has the advantage of that immortal poet in per&s;pi|cuity?</P>
<P>Is the fact certain, my dear Mr. Deane, that Mil|ton wants per&s;picuity? I have been bold enough &s;ome|times to think, that he makes a greater di&s;play of his reading, than was quite nece&s;&s;ary to his unbounded &s;ub|ject. But the age in which Shake&s;peare flouri&s;hed, might be called, The age of Engli&s;h Learning, as well as of Engli&s;h Bravery. The Queen and her court, the very Ladies of it, were more learned than any court of our Engli&s;h Sovereigns was before, or hath been &s;ince. What a prodigy of learning, in the &s;hort reign of Edward the VIth, was the Lady Jane Grey!&mdash;Greek, as well as Latin, was familiar to her: So it was to Queen Elizabeth. And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the natural genius's of tho&s;e Ladies were more confined, or limited, for their knowlege of Latin and Greek? Milton, tho' a little nearer us, lived in har&s;her and more tumultuous times.</P>
<P>O, Sir! &s;aid Harriet, then I find I was a very imperti|nent creature in the conver&s;ation to which you refer.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="360">
Not &s;o, my deare&s;t Love!&mdash;Mr. Walden, I re|member, &s;ays, that learning in that a&s;&s;embly was not brought before a fair tribunal. He &s;hould have known, that it had not a competent advocate in him.</P>
<P>But, Sir Charles, &s;aid Mr. Beachamp, I cannot but ob&s;erve, that too much &s;tre&s;s is laid upon Learning, as it is called, by tho&s;e who have preten&s;ions to it. You will not always find, that a &s;cholar is a more happy man than an unlearned one. He has not <HI>gene|rally</HI> more prudence, more wi&s;dom, in the manage|ment of his affairs.</P>
<P>What, my dear Beauchamp, is this &s;aying, but that there is great difference between theory and prac|tice? This ob&s;ervation comes very generou&s;ly, and, with regard to the Ladies, very gallantly, from you, who are a learned man: But as you are al&s;o a very prudent man, let me a&s;k you, Do you think you have the le&s;s prudence for your learning? If <HI>not,</HI> Is not learning a valuable <HI>addition?</HI></P>
<P>But pray, Sir Charles, &s;aid Mrs. Selby, let me a&s;k your opinion: Do you think, that if women had the &s;ame opportunities, the &s;ame education, as men, they would not equal them, in their attain|ments?</P>
<P>Women, my dear Mrs. Selby, are women &s;ooner than men are men. They have not, therefore, <HI>gene|rally,</HI> the learning-time that men have, if they had equal genius's.</P>

<P>He &s;poke very highly in her prai&s;e, upon the occa|&s;ion; owned, that the Letters he had been favoured with the &s;ight of, had given him deeper impre&s;&s;ions in her favour, than even her Beauty: Hoped for farther communications; applauded her for her principles, and her inoffen&s;ive vivacity&mdash;That &s;weet, that inno|cent vivacity, and noble frankne&s;s of heart, &s;aid he,
<PB N="364" REF="365">
taking her hand, which I hope you will never think of re&s;training.</P>
<P>As to the conver&s;ation you &s;peak of, proceeded he, I repeat, that I <HI>was</HI> apprehen&s;ive, when I read it, that languages were &s;poken of in it &s;lightly; and yet, perhaps, I am mi&s;taken. You, my Beauchamp, I think, if my deare&s;t Life will oblige us both by the communication, and <HI>choo&s;es</HI> to do &s;o (for that mu&s;t be the condition on which all her goodne&s;s to us mu&s;t be expected) &s;hall be judge between us: You know, bet|ter than I, what &s;tories of unexhau&s;ted knowledge lie in the works of tho&s;e great Antients, which &s;uffered in the hands of poor Mr. Walden: You know what the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent ages have owed, and what all future will owe, to <HI>Homer, Ari&s;totle, Virgil, Cicero:</HI> You can take in the nece&s;&s;ity there is of re&s;training inno|vation, and pre&s;erving old rules and in&s;titutions, and of employing the youth of our Sex, who would otherwi&s;e be much wor&s;e employed (as we &s;ee in tho&s;e who neglect their &s;tudies) in the attainment of lan|guages that can convey to them &s;uch lights in every &s;cience: Tho' it were to be wi&s;hed, that morals &s;hould take up more of the learner's attention than they generally do. You know, that the true&s;t parts of learning are to be found in the Roman and Greek writers; and you know, that tran&s;lation (were every|thing worthy our notice tran&s;lated) cannot convey tho&s;e beauties which &s;cholars only can reli&s;h; and which learned foreigners, if a man travels, will expect &s;hould not have e&s;caped his ob&s;ervation. As to the Ladies, Mrs. Shirley, has admirably ob&s;erved, that there is a degree of knowledge very compatible with their duties (Conde&s;cending excellence! bowing to Mrs. Shirley) and highly becoming them; &s;uch as will make them rejoice, and, I will add, improve a man of &s;en&s;e, &s;weeten his manners, and render him a much more &s;ociable, a much more amiable crea|ture,
<PB N="365" REF="366">
and, of con&s;equence, greatly more happy in him&s;elf, than otherwi&s;e he would be from books and &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Well but, brother, you &s;aid ju&s;t now, that we were only, for plea&s;antry-&s;ake, &s;kimming over the &s;urface of the argument; and that you had enough to &s;ay to &s;ilence all my oppo&s;ition, were you to give the &s;ubject its due weight. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that, to &s;ilence all my oppo&s;ition, you mu&s;t have a va&s;t deal more to &s;ay, than you have &s;aid hitherto; and yet you have thrown in &s;ome hints which &s;tick with me, tho' you have concluded with &s;ome magnificent intimations of &s;uperiority over us&mdash;Power and right to protect, tra|vel, toil for us, and lay your trophies at our feet, and-&s;o-forth&mdash;Surely, &s;urely, this is dimini&s;hing us, and exalting your&s;elves, by laying us under high ob|ligations to your genero&s;ity. Pray, Sir, let us have, if you plea&s;e, one or two intimation&punc; of tho&s;e weightier arguments, that could, as you fancy, &s;ilence your Charlotte's oppo&s;ition. I &s;ay, that we women, were our education the &s;ame&mdash;You know what I would be at&mdash;Your <HI>weightier</HI> arguments, if you plea&s;e&mdash;or a &s;pecimen only <HI>on pa&s;&s;ant.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing, my Charlotte, that all human &s;ouls are, in them&s;elves, equal; yet the very de&s;ign of the dif|ferent machines in which they are inclo&s;ed, is to &s;uper|induce a temporary difference on their original equa|lity; a difference adapted to the different purpo&s;es for which they are de&s;igned by Providence in the pre&s;ent tran&s;itory &s;tate. When tho&s;e purpo&s;es are at an end, this difference will be at an end too. When Sex cea&s;es, inequality of Souls will cea&s;e; and women will certainly be on a foot with men, as to intellectu|als, in Heaven. There, indeed, will you no longer have <HI>Lords</HI> over you: neither will you have <HI>Admi|rers:</HI> Which, in <HI>your</HI> pre&s;ent e&s;timate of things, will perhaps balance the account. In the mean time, if you can &s;ee any occa&s;ions that may call for &s;tronger
<PB N="366" REF="367">
under&s;tandings in male life, than in your own; you, at the &s;ame time, fee an argument to acquie&s;ce in a per&s;ua&s;ion of a pre&s;ent inequality between the two Sexe. You know, I have allowed exceptions. Will you, Charlotte, compliment your&s;elf with being one?</P>
<P>Now, brother, I feel, methinks, that you are a little hard upon Charlotte: But, Ladies, you &s;ee how the matter &s;tands.&mdash;You are all &s;ilent.&mdash;But, Sir, you graciou&s;ly allow, that there <HI>is</HI> a degree of knowledge which is very compatible with the DUTIES of us women, and highly <HI>becoming</HI> us: will you have the goodne&s;s to point out to us what this compatible learning is, that we may not mi&s;take&mdash;and &s;o become excentric, as I may &s;ay, bur&s;t out orb, and do more mi&s;chief than ever we could do good?</P>
<P><HI>Could</HI> I point out the boundaries, Charlotte, it might not to <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;pirits be &s;o proper: The limit might be treated as the one prohibited tree in the garden. But let me &s;ay, That genius, whether in man or woman, will pu&s;h it&s;elf into light. If it has a laudable tendency, let it, as a ray of the Divinity, be encouraged, as well in the one Sex as in the other: I would not, by any means, have it limited: A little knowledge leads to vanity and conceit. I would only, methinks, have a Parent, a Governor, a Preceptor, bend his &s;trength to re&s;train its foibles; but not throw &s;o much cold water upon the &s;acred flame as &s;hould quench it; &s;ince, if he did, &s;tupidity, at lea&s;t de|jection, might take place of the emanation, and the per&s;on might be mi&s;erable for life.</P>
<P>Well, then, we mu&s;t <HI>compromi&s;e,</HI> I think, &s;aid I: But, on recollection, I thought I had injoined you, Sir Charles, to the ob&s;ervance of neutrality. Har|riet, whi&s;pered I, we are only, after all, to be al|lowed, as far as I can find, in this temporary &s;tate, like tame doves, to go about hou&s;e, and-&s;e-forth, as Biddy &s;ays, in the play.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="368">
Harriet, could &s;he have found time (But, by mu|tual con&s;ent, they are hardly ever a&s;under) would have given you a better account of this conver&s;ation than I have done; &s;o would Lucy: But take it, as it offers, from</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday, Nov. <HI>19.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY dear Lady G. in&s;i&s;ts upon my writing to your Lady&s;hip an account of the appearance which the lovelie&s;t Couple in England made this day at Church.</P>
<P>We all thought nothing could have added to the charms of our Harriet's per&s;on; but yet her dre&s;s and jewels did. I &s;ighed, from pride for the honour of Female Beauty, to <HI>think</HI> they did. Can my dear Har|riet, thought I, exqui&s;itely lovely as &s;he is in any dre&s;s, be ornamented by richer &s;ilks than common, by co&s;tly laces, by jewels? Can dre&s;s add grace to that admirable proportion, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e fine features, to which no painter yet has ever done ju&s;tice, tho' every family related to her has a picture of her, drawn by a different hand of eminence?</P>
<P>We admired the Bridegroom as much as we did her, when, (before we could have thought he had been half ready) he joined Mrs. Shirley, my Aunt Selby, and me, in the great Parlour, completely dre&s;&s;ed. But what we mo&s;t admired in him was, that native dignity and ea&s;e, and that inattentivene&s;s to his own figure and appearance, which demon&s;trate the truly|fine gentleman, accu&s;tomed, as he is, to be always elegant.</P>
<P>When his Lady pre&s;ented her&s;elf to him, and to us,
<PB N="368" REF="369">
in all her glory, how did the dear creature dazle us! We involuntarily aro&s;e, as if to pay our homage to her. Sir Charles approached her with rather an air of greater freedom than u&s;ual, as if he con&s;idered not the dre&s;s, as having added to the value he has for her: Yet, Lovelie&s;t of women, he called her; and taking her hand, pre&s;ented her to her grandmamma: Re|ceive, and again ble&s;s, my Angel, &s;aid he, be&s;t of Parents!&mdash;How lovely! But what is even all this a|mazing loveline&s;s to the graces of her mind? They ri&s;e upon me every hour. She hardly opens her lips, but I find rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, and ble&s;s you both, my dear Ladies: For God and you have given her goodne&s;s.&mdash;My deare&s;t Life, allow me to &s;ay, that this &s;weet per&s;on, which will be your fir&s;t perfection in every &s;tranger's eye, is but a &s;econd in mine.</P>
<P>In&s;truct me, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, ba&s;hfully, bowing her face upon his hand, as he held hers, to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> your Love, by improving the mind you have the goodne&s;s to prefer; and no creature was ever on earth &s;o happy as I &s;hall be.</P>
<P>My dear Daughter, &s;aid her delighted grandmother, you &s;ee&punc; can hardly bare your goodne&s;s, Sir. You mu&s;t blame her for &s;omething, to keep down her pride.</P>
<P>My Harriet, replied he, cannot be proud of what the &s;ilkworm can do for her, or of the jeweller's po|li&s;h: But now you call upon me, madam, I will tax her with a real fault. I open all my heart to her, as &s;ubjects occa&s;ionally offer: I want her to have a will, and to let me know it. The franke&s;t of all Female hearts will not treat me with that &s;weet familiarity which bani&s;hes di&s;tance. You &s;ee, my deare&s;t Love, that I chide you before your parental friends, and your Lucy.</P>
<P>It is your own fault, Sir: Indeed it is. You pre|vent me in all my wi&s;hes. Awe will mingle with the Love of per&s;ons who are under perpetual obligation.
<PB N="369" REF="370">
My dear two mamma's, you mu&s;t not blame <HI>me;</HI> you mu&s;t blame Sir Charles: He takes away, by his goodne&s;s, even the <HI>power</HI> of making &s;uitable acknow|legements, and then complains I do not &s;peak.</P>
<P>My uncle Selby came in. He &s;tood looking upon my cou&s;in, for a few moments, in &s;ilence; then broke out, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, you may indeed boa&s;t, that you have for a Wife the <HI>Flower of the Briti&s;h world,</HI> as you once called her: And, let me tell you, Niece, you have for a Husband the noble&s;t and gal|lante&s;t of men. Happy, happy Pair! &s;ay I. My dear Mr. Deane, &s;aid he, who ju&s;t then entered, if you will keep me in countenance, I will venture to &s;alute that charming creature.</P>
<P>Sir Charles pre&s;ented his Bride to them both. With a bent knee &s;he received their &s;alutes. At that mo|ment came in the three Lords, who followed the ex|ample. Lord W. called her Angel&mdash;Sir Charles looked delighted with the prai&s;es of his Bride.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the company being come, we proceed|ed to church.</P>
<P>We were early; but the Church was crouded. How were the charming Couple admired on their a|lighting, and as they walked to their pew! Never did my Cou&s;in <HI>her&s;elf</HI> look &s;o lovely! How charmingly looked the Bridegroom! But he forgot not that hum|ble deportment, full of reverence for the place, and the Divine Offices, which &s;eemed to make him ab|&s;ent for the time to that &s;plendor and beauty which took every eye <HI>out of</HI> our own pew. His example was enough to give a proper behaviour, had it been needful, to every one <HI>in it.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould have told your Lady&s;hip, that Mr. Gre|ville had &s;ent, ever-night, a &s;ullenly-complai&s;ant re|que&s;t to my aunt, in writing, importing, that as he heard the Bride would make her appearance on the morrow, the Bride-men and maids, if it broke not into our Ceremonial, would accept of his pew, which
<PB N="370" REF="371">
is over-again&s;t ours, for the <HI>look</HI> of the thing, he &s;aid; tho' he could not promi&s;e but he &s;hould all the day cur&s;e the occa&s;ion. By this we found, he was not gone to Lady Frampton's, as he had de&s;igned. His of|fer was thankfully accepted.</P>
<P>There was a great concour&s;e of the genteele&s;t peo|ple there. Every-body, men and women, looked delighted on the occa&s;ion. The humility of the Bride was tried, by the re&s;pects paid her between the offices, by all who had ever been in her company. They &s;hould have reined in their own pride; for it was to <HI>that,</HI> as much as to re&s;pect to her, I doubt not, that their notice was owing. She looked con&s;cious, ba&s;hful; <HI>&s;ly,</HI> I told her afterwards. She hates the word: But, as I &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould not have given the idea, that made no other word &s;o proper to expre&s;s it, and which mu&s;t be more ob&s;ervable in <HI>her</HI> generally open free countenance, than in that of any other. She more than once &s;aw devoirs paid her by a <HI>leer,</HI> when her &s;weet face was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that, had &s;he <HI>not</HI> returned the compliment, it might have pa&s;&s;ed that &s;he had not &s;een them. But what an In&s;en&s;ible mu&s;t have been my cou&s;in, had &s;he not been proud of being Lady Grandi&s;on! She is not quite an Angel, yet: She has a few <HI>Femalities,</HI> as my uncle whim&s;ically calls our little foibles. So, perhaps, &s;he <HI>&s;hould.</HI> But nobody &s;aw the lea&s;t defect in your brother. His dre&s;s mo&s;t charmingly became him; and when he looked upon his Bride, his eyes were fixed on her eyes, with &s;uch a &s;weet benignity and complai&s;ance, as if he &s;aw her mind through them, and could not &s;pare a glance to her ornaments: Yet by his own dre&s;s he &s;hewed, that he was not Stoical non-conformi&s;t to the fa&s;hion of the world. But the politene&s;s and re&s;pect with which he treated her, did them both credit, and cre|dit (as Lady G. ob&s;erved) to the whole Sex, Such unaffected tenderne&s;s in his re&s;pect; and known to be &s;o brave, &s;o good a man!&mdash;O my dear Lady L. what
<PB N="371" REF="372">
an admirable man is your brother! What a happy creature is my Harriet!</P>
<P>When Divine Service was over, I was afraid our Proce&s;&s;ion, as I may call it, would have been inter|rupted by the compliments of &s;ome of the gentry of our acquaintance, who&s;e opened pew-doors &s;hewed their readine&s;s to addre&s;s them: But all pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilent re&s;pects from Gentlemen and Ladie. My cou&s;in, when &s;he came home, rejoiced that one of her pa|rading times was over: But when, my deare&s;t Love, &s;aid Sir Charles, will the time be pa&s;t, that all who &s;ee you will admire you?</P>
<P>The Church in the afternoon was &s;till more crouded than before. How were Sir Charles and my uncle ble&s;&s;ed by the poor, and people of low degree, for their well-di&s;pen&s;ed bounty to them!</P>
<P>My cou&s;in has delighted Mrs. Shirly, by telling her, that Sir Charles had &s;aid there would be a Rite wanting, till he and &s;he had communicated, accord|ing to the order of the Church, at the Altar, on this particular occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t now is every-thing &s;ettled that Sir Charles wi&s;hed to be &s;ettled. Lady G. will acquaint you with particulars, I doubt not.</P>
