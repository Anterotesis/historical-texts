PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THESE two E&s;&s;ays on <HI>Suicide</HI> and <HI>the Im|mortality of the Soul,</HI> though not publi&s;h|ed in any edition of his works, are generally attributed to the late ingenious Mr. Hume.</P>
<P>The well-known contempt of this eminent philo&s;opher for the common convictions of mankind, rai&s;ed an apprehen&s;ion of the con|tents from the very title of the&s;e pieces. But the celebrity of the author's name, renders them, notwith&s;tanding, in &s;ome degree objects of great curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Owing to this circum&s;tance, a few copies have been clande&s;tinely circulated, at a large price, for &s;ome time, but without any com|ment. The very my&s;tery attending this mode of &s;elling them, made them more an ob|ject of reque&s;t than they would otherwi&s;e have been.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4">
The pre&s;ent publication comes abroad un|der no &s;uch re&s;traint, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es very &s;upe|rior advantages. The <HI>Notes</HI> annexed are in|tended to expo&s;e the &s;ophi&s;try contained in the original E&s;&s;ays, and may &s;hew how little we have to fear from the adver&s;aries of the&s;e great truths, from the pitiful figure which e|ven Mr. Hume makes in thus violently exhau&s;t|ing his la&s;t &s;trength in an abortive attempt to traduce or di&s;credit them.</P>
<P>The two very ma&s;terly Letters from the E|loi&s;a of Ro&s;&s;eau on the &s;ubject of <HI>Suicide,</HI> have been much celebrated, and we hope will be con&s;idered as materially increa&s;ing the value of this curious collection.</P>
<P>The admirers of <HI>Mr. Hume</HI> will be plea&s;ed with &s;eeing the remains of a favourite author re&s;cued in this manner from that oblivion to which the prejudices of his countrymen had, in all appearance, con&s;igned them; and even the religious part of mankind have &s;ome rea&s;on of triumph from the &s;triking in&s;tance here gi|ven of truth's &s;uperiority to error, even when error has all the advantage of an elegant ge|nius, and a great literary reputation to recom|mend it.</P>

<P>ONE con&s;iderable advantage that ari&s;es from Philo&s;ophy, con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;overeign antidote which it affords to &s;uper&s;tition and fal&s;e religion. All other remedies again&s;t that pe&s;tilent di&s;temper are vain, or at lea&s;t uncertain. Plain good &s;en&s;e and the prac|tice of the world, which alone &s;erve mo&s;t purpo&s;es of life, are here found ineffectu|al: Hi&s;tory as well as daily experience fur|ni&s;h in&s;tances of men endowed with the
<PB N="2" REF="6">
&s;tronge&s;t capacity for bu&s;ine&s;s and affairs, who have all their lives crouched under &s;la|very to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;uper&s;tition. Even gai|ety and &s;weetne&s;s of temper, which infu&s;e a balm into every other wound, afford no remedy to &s;o virulent a poi&s;on; as we may particularly ob&s;erve of the fair &s;ex, who tho' commonly po&s;&s;e&s;t of the&s;e rich pre&s;ents of nature, feel many of their joys bla&s;ted by this importunate intruder. But when &s;ound Philo&s;ophy has once gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, &s;uper&s;tition is effectually excluded, and one may fairly affirm that her triumph over this enemy is more complete than over mo&s;t of the vices and imperfections incident to human nature. Love or anger, ambition or avarice, have their root in the temper and affections, which the &s;ounde&s;t rea&s;on is &s;carce ever able fully to correct, but &s;uper&s;tition being founded on fal&s;e opinion, mu&s;t immediately vani&s;h when true philo&s;o|phy has in&s;pired ju&s;ter &s;entiments of &s;upe|rior powers. The conte&s;t is here more e|qual between the di&s;temper and the medi|cine,
<PB N="3" REF="7">
and nothing can hinder the latter from proving effectual but its being fal&s;e and &s;o|phi&s;ticated.</P>
<P>IT will here be &s;uperfluous to magnify the merits of Philo&s;ophy by di&s;playing the pernicious tendency of that vice of which it cures the human mind. <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE1.1">(1)</REF> The &s;uper|&s;titious man &s;ays Tully<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Divin. lib. ii.</BIBL></NOTE> is mi&s;erable in every &s;cene, in every incident in life; even &s;leep it&s;elf, which bani&s;hes all other cares of unhappy mortals, affords to him matter of new terror; while he examines his dreams, and finds in tho&s;e vi&s;ions of the night prog|no&s;tications of future calamities. I may add that tho' death alone can put a full period to his mi&s;ery, he dares not fly to this refuge, but &s;till prolongs a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence from a vain fear le&s;t he offend his Maker, by u|&s;ing the power, with which that beneficent being has endowed him. The pre&s;ents of God and nature are ravi&s;hed from us by this
<PB N="4" REF="8">
cruel enemy, and notwith&s;tanding that one &s;tep would remove us from the regions of pain and &s;orrow, her menaces &s;till chain us down to a hated being which &s;he her&s;elf chiefly contributes to render mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>'TIS ob&s;erved by &s;uch as have been re|duced by the calamities of life to the nece&s;|&s;ity of employing this fatal remedy, that if the un&s;ea&s;onable care of their friends de|prive them of that &s;pecies of Death which they propo&s;ed to them&s;elves, they &s;eldom venture upon any other, or can &s;ummon up &s;o much re&s;olution a &s;econd time as to exe|cute their purpo&s;e. So great is our horror of death, that when it pre&s;ents it&s;elf under any form, be&s;ides that to which a man has endeavoured to reconcile his imagination, it acquires new terrors and overcomes his feeble courage: But when the menaces of &s;uper&s;tition are joined to this natural timidity, no wonder it quite deprives men of all power over their lives, &s;ince even many plea&s;ures and enjoyments,
<PB N="5" REF="9">
to which we are carried by a &s;trong propen|&s;ity, are torn from us by this inhuman ty|rant. Let us here endeavour to re&s;tore men to their native liberty, by examining all the common arguments again&s;t Suicide, and &s;hewing that that action may be free from every imputation of guilt or blame, accord|ing to the &s;entiments of all the antient phi|lo&s;ophers. <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE1.2">(2)</REF></P>
<P>IF Suicide be criminal, it mu&s;t be a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of our duty either to God, our neighbour, or our&s;elves.&mdash;To prove that &s;uicide is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of our duty to God, the following con&s;iderations may perhaps &s;uffice. In order to govern the material world, the almighty Creator has e&s;tabli&s;hed general and immutable laws, by which all bodies, from the greate&s;t planet to the &s;malle&s;t particle of matter, are maintained in their proper &s;phere and func|tion. To govern the animal world, he has endowed all living creatures with bodi|ly and mental powers; with &s;en&s;es, pa&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
appetites, memory, and judgment, by which they are impelled or regulated in that cour&s;e of life to which they are de&s;|tined. The&s;e two di&s;tinct principles of the material and animal world, continually encroach upon each other, and mutually re|tard or forward each others operation. The powers of men and of all other animals are re&s;trained and directed by the nature and qualities of the &s;urrounding bodies, and the modifications and actions of the&s;e bo|dies are ince&s;&s;antly altered by the operation of all animals. Man is &s;topt by rivers in his pa&s;&s;age over the &s;urface of the earth; and rivers, when properly directed, lend their force to the motion of machines, which &s;erve to the u&s;e of man. But tho' the provinces of the material and animal powers are not kept entirely &s;eperate, there re&s;ults from thence no di&s;cord or di&s;order in the creation; on the contrary, from the mixture, union, and contra&s;t of all the va|rious powers of inanimate bodies and liv|ing creatures, ari&s;es that &s;ympathy, har|mony,
<PB N="7" REF="11">
and proportion, which affords the &s;ure&s;t argument of &s;upreme wi&s;dom. The providence of the Deity appears not imme|diately in any operation, but governs every thing by tho&s;e general and immutable laws, which have been e&s;tabli&s;hed from the beginning of time. All events, in one &s;en&s;e, may be pronounced the action of the Almighty, they all proceed from tho&s;e powers with which he has endowed his creatures. A hou&s;e which falls by its own weight, is not brought to ruin by his providence, more than one de&s;troyed by the hands of men; nor are the human fa|culties le&s;s his workman&s;hip, than the laws of motion and gravitation. When the pa&s;&s;ions play, when the judgment dictates, when the limbs obey; this is all the opera|tion of God, and upon the&s;e animate prin|ciples, as well as upon the inanimate, has he e&s;tabli&s;hed the goverment of the univer&s;e. Every event is alike important in the eyes of that infinite being, who takes in at one glance the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions of &s;pace, and
<PB N="8" REF="12">
remote&s;t periods of time. There is no e|vent, however important to us, which he has exempted from the general laws that govern the univer&s;e, or which he has pecu|liarly re&s;erved for his own immediate ac|tion and operation. The revolution of &s;tates and empires depends upon the &s;malle&s;t ca|price or pa&s;&s;ion of &s;ingle men; and the lives of men are &s;hortened or extended by the &s;malle&s;t accident of air or diet, &s;un|&s;hine or tempe&s;t. Nature &s;till conti|nues her progre&s;s and operation; and if general laws be ever broke by par|ticular volitions of the Deity, 'tis after a manner which entirely e&s;capes human ob|&s;ervation. As on the one hand, the ele|ments and other inanimate parts of the cre|ation carry on their action without regard to the particular intere&s;t and &s;ituation of men; &s;o men are entru&s;ted to their own judgment and di&s;cretion in the various &s;hocks of matter, and may employ every fa|culty with which they are endowed, in or|der to provide for their ea&s;e, happine&s;s, or
<PB N="9" REF="13">
pre&s;ervation. What is the meaning then of that principle, that a man who tired of life, and hunted by pain and mi&s;ery, brave|ly overcomes all the natural terrors of death, and makes his e&s;cape from this cru|el &s;cene: that &s;uch a man I &s;ay, has incur|red the indignation of his Creator by en|croaching on the office of divine providence, and di&s;turbing the order of the univer&s;e? &s;hall we a&s;&s;ert that the Almighty has re&s;er|ved to him&s;elf in any peculiar manner the di&s;po&s;al of the lives of men, and has not &s;ubmitted that event, in common with others, to the general laws by which the univer&s;e is governed? This is plainly &s;al&s;e; the lives of men depend upon the &s;ame laws as the lives of all other animals; and the&s;e are &s;ubjected to the general laws of matter and motion. The fall of a tower, or the infu&s;ion of a poi&s;on, will de&s;troy a man equally with the meane&s;t creature; an in|undation &s;weeps away every thing with|out di&s;tinction that comes within the reach of its fury. Since therefore the lives of men
<PB N="10" REF="14">
are for ever dependant on the general laws of matter and motion, is a man's di&s;po&s;ing of his life criminal, becau&s;e in every ca&s;e it is criminal to encroach upon the&s;e laws, or di&s;turb their operation? But this &s;eems ab&s;urd; all animals are entru&s;ted to their own prudence and &s;kill for their conduct in the world, and have full authority as far as their power extends, to alter all the operati|ons of nature. Without the excerci&s;e of this authority they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t a moment; every action, every motion of a man, inno|vates on the order of &s;ome parts of matter, and diverts from their ordinary cour&s;e the general laws of motion. Putting toge|ther, therefore, the&s;e conclu&s;ions, we find that human life depends upon the general laws of matter and motion, and that it is no encroachment on the office of provi|dence to di&s;turb or alter the&s;e general laws: Has not every one, of con&s;equence, the free di&s;po&s;al of his own life? And may he not lawfully employ that power with which nature has endowed him? In order
<PB N="11" REF="15">
to de&s;troy the evidence of this conclu&s;ion, we mu&s;t &s;hew a rea&s;on why this particular ca&s;e is excepted; is it becau&s;e human life is of &s;uch great importance, that 'tis a pre|&s;umption for human prudence to di&s;po&s;e of it? But the life of a man is of no greater importance to the univer&s;e than that of an oy&s;ter. And were it of ever &s;o great im|portance, the order of human nature has actually &s;ubmitted it to human prudence, and reduced us to a nece&s;&s;ity, in every in|cident, of determining concerning it.&mdash;Were the di&s;po&s;al of human life &s;o much re&s;erved as the peculiar province of the Almighty, that it were an encroachment on his right, for men to di&s;po&s;e of their own lives; it would be equally criminal to act for the pre&s;ervation of life as for its de&s;truc|tion. If I turn a&s;ide a &s;tone which is fal|ling upon my head, I di&s;turb the cour&s;e of nature, and I invade the peculiar province of the Almighty, by lengthening out my life beyond the period which by the gene|ral laws of matter and motion he had a&s;&s;ign|ed it. <REF TARGET="CN002705-NOTE1.3">(3)</REF></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16">
A hair, a fly, an in&s;ect is able to de&s;troy this mighty being who&s;e life is of &s;uch im|portance.

Far be &s;uch &s;entiments from me; I am only convinced of a matter of fact, which you your&s;elf acknowledge po&s;&s;ible, that human life may be unhappy; and that my exi&s;tence, if further prolonged, would become ineligible; but I thank Provi|dence, both for the good which I have al|ready enjoyed, and for the power with which I am endowed of e&s;caping the ill that

When I fall upon my own &s;word, therefore, I receive my death equally from the hands of the Deity as if it had proceeded from a lion, a precipice, or a fever. The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which you re|quire to providence, in every calamity that befals me, excludes not human &s;kill and in|du&s;try, if po&s;&s;ible by their means I can a|void or e&s;cape the calamity: And why may I not employ one remedy as well as another?&mdash;If my life be not my own, it were criminal for me to put it in danger, as

Its operations are his works equally with that chain of events which it invades, and which ever principle prevails, we may for that very rea&s;on con|clude it to be mo&s;t favoured by him. Be it animate, or inanimate, rational, or irra|tional, 'tis all a ca&s;e: its power is &s;till de|rived from the &s;upreme Creator, and is a|like comprehended in the order of his pro|vidence. When the horror of pain pre|vails over the love of life; when a volun|tary action anticipates the effects of blind cau&s;es, 'tis only in con&s;equence of tho&s;e

powers and principles which he has im|planted in his creatures. Divine provi|dence is &s;till inviolate, and placed far be|yond the reach of human injuries. 'Tis impious &s;ays the old Roman &s;uper&s;tition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>TACIT. Ann. lib. i.</BIBL></NOTE> to divert rivers from their cour&s;e, or invade the prerogatives of nature: 'Tis im|pious &s;ays the French &s;uper&s;tition to ino|culate for the &s;mall-pox, or u&s;urp the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of providence by voluntarily produc|ing di&s;tempers and maladies. 'Tis im|pious &s;ays the modern <HI>European</HI> &s;uper&s;ti|tion, to put a period to our own life, and thereby rebel again&s;t our Creator; and why not impious, &s;ay I, to build hou&s;es, culti|vate the ground, or &s;ail upon the ocean? In all the&s;e actions we employ our powers of mind and body, to produce &s;ome innova|tion in the cour&s;e of nature; and in none of them do we any more. They are all of them therefore equally innocent, or equal|ly criminal. <HI>But you are placed by provi|dence, like a centinal, in a particular &s;tation,</HI>

<HI>and when you de&s;ert it without being re|called, you are equally guilty of rebellion again&s;t your almighty &s;overeign, and have incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure.</HI>&mdash;I a&s;k, why do you conclude that providence has placed me in this &s;tation? for my part I find that I owe my birth to a long chain of cau&s;es, of which many depended upon voluntary actions of men. <HI>But providence guided all the&s;e cau&s;es, and nothing hap|pens in the univer&s;e without its con&s;ent and co-operation.</HI> If &s;o, then neither does my death, however voluntary, happen without its con&s;ent; and whenever pain or &s;orrow &s;o far overcome my patience, as to make me tired of life, I may conclude that I am recalled from my &s;tation in the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t expre&s;s terms. 'Tis providence &s;urely that has placed me at this pre&s;ent in this chamber: But may I not leave it when I think pro|per, without being liable to the imputation of having de&s;erted my po&s;t or &s;tation? When I &s;hall be dead, the principles of

which I am compo&s;ed will &s;till perform their part in the univer&s;e, and will be equally u&s;eful in the grand fabrick, as when they compo&s;ed this individual creature.

that it has taken away every po&s;&s;ible re&s;traint from natural religion, allowing it to exert it&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in &s;inding out the fundamental truths of virtue, and in ac|quie&s;cing in them, in openly avowing and ac|knowledging them when revealed, in exten|ding the views and expectations of men, in giving them more ju&s;t and liberal &s;entiments, and in publickly and uniformly di&s;claim|ing any intention of e&s;tabli&s;hing a kingdom for its votaries or believers in this world.</P>

Revelation con&s;iders mankind in their highe&s;t capacity, as the rational and accountable &s;ubjects of God, and as capable both of pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, according to their behaviour. Its chief, if not its &s;ole de&s;ign, is to give us tho&s;e views and im|pre&s;&s;ions of our nature, of our &s;tate, of the perfections, the coun&s;els, the laws, and the government of God, which, under the influence of providence, are the immediate and infallible means of the purity, of the comfort, and of the moral order, rectitude, and excellence of our immortal &s;ouls.

certain her ideas mu&s;t be immaterial. And the&s;e cannot po&s;&s;ibly act either by contact or impul&s;e. When one body impels another, the body moved is affected only by the impul&s;e. But the mind, whenever rou&s;ed by any plea|&s;ing or painful &s;en&s;ation, in mo&s;t ca&s;es looks round her, and deliberates whether a change of &s;tate is proper, or the pre&s;ent more eligible; and moves or re&s;ts accord|dingly. Her preceptions, therefore, contri|bute no further to action, than by exciting her active powers. On the contrary, matter is blindly and ob&s;tinately in that &s;tate in which it is, whether of motion or re&s;t, till changed by &s;ome other adequate cau&s;e. Sup|po&s;e we re&s;t the &s;tate of any body, &s;ome ex|ternal force is requi&s;ite to put it in motion; and, in proportion as this force is greater or &s;mall, the motion mu&s;t be &s;wift or flow. Did not this body continue in its former &s;tate, no external force would be requi&s;ite to change it; nor, when changed, would different degrees of force be nece&s;&s;ary to move it in different de|grees of velocity. When motion is impre&s;&s;ed on any body, to bring it to re&s;t, an <HI>extra</HI>-force mu&s;t always be applied, in proportion to the intended effect. This re&s;i&s;tance is ob|&s;ervable in bodies both when moved in par|ticular directions, and to bear an exact propor|tion to the <HI>vis impre&s;&s;ia,</HI> and to the quantity of matter moved. Were it po&s;&s;ible to extract from matter the qualities of &s;olidity and ex|ten&s;ion,
<PB N="55" REF="59">
the matter whence &s;uch qualities were extracted would no longer re&s;i&s;t; and con|&s;equently re&s;i&s;tance is the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of them, which, therefore, in all directions mu&s;t be the &s;ame. The degree of re&s;i&s;tance in any body being proportionate to the <HI>vis impre&s;&s;a,</HI> it follows, when that body is con&s;idered in a|ny particular &s;tate, whether of motion or re&s;t, the degrees of re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t either indefinitely multiply, or decrea&s;e, according to all po&s;&s;ible degrees of the moving force. But when the &s;ame body is con&s;idered ab&s;olutely, or without fixing any particular &s;tate, the re&s;i&s;tance is immutable; and all the degrees of it, which that body would exert upon the acce&s;&s;ion of any impre&s;&s;ed force, mu&s;t be conceived as ac|tually in it. Nor can matter have any ten|dency contrary to that re&s;i&s;tance, otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t be equal or &s;uperior. If equal, the two contrary tendencies would de&s;troy each other. If &s;uperior, the re&s;i&s;tance would be de&s;troyed. Thus change would eternally &s;ucceed to change without one intermediate in&s;tant, &s;o that no time would be a&s;&s;igned when any bo|dy was in any particular &s;tate. Gravitation it&s;elf, the mo&s;t &s;imple and univer&s;al law, &s;eems far from being a tendency natural to mat|ter; &s;ince it is found to act internally, and not in proportion to the &s;uperfices of any bo|dy; which it would not do, if it were only the mechanical action of matter upon matter.

From all this, it appears, that matter con|&s;idered merely as &s;uch, is &s;o far from having a principle of &s;pontaneous motion, that it is &s;tubbornly inactive, and mu&s;t eternally remain in the &s;ame &s;tate in which it happens to be, except influenced by &s;ome other&mdash;that is, &s;ome immaterial power.

But the mind, by one in&s;tantaneous effort, mea&s;ures the di&s;tance from pole to pole, from heaven to earth, from one fixed &s;tar to another; and not confined within the limits of the vi&s;ible creation, &s;hoots into immen&s;ity with a rapi|dity to which even that of lightning, or &s;un|beams, is no compari&s;on.

So well con&s;tituted is the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of things, that all the principles e&s;&s;ential to human life and happine&s;s continue, as it is likely they ever will, to operate, in &s;pite of every &s;ort of clamour which &s;ophi&s;try or &s;ceptici&s;m has rai&s;ed or can rai&s;e again&s;t them.</P>

<P>(4) There is not a &s;ingle word in all this elabarate and tedious deduction, which has not been urged and refuted five hundred times. Our ignorance of the divine perfections, as is u&s;ual with this writer, is here &s;tated as an unan&s;werable exception to the conclu&s;ion u&s;u|ally drawn from them. But he very artfully overlooks, that this great ignorance will be equally conclu&s;ive as applied to either &s;ide of the argument. When we compare, however, the character of God, as a wi&s;e &s;uperinten|dant, and generous benefactor, with the &s;tate in which things at pre&s;ent appear, where vir|tue is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> depre&s;&s;ed and afflicted, and vice ap|parently triumphs, it will be treated with the infamy it merits, and virtue receive that

happine&s;s and honour, which, from its own intrin&s;ic worth, it de&s;erves, and, from its conformity to the nature of God, it has rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject, perhaps, has been too much exaggerated, and &s;ome pious men have weakly thought, the be&s;t way to convince us that order and happine&s;s prevailed in a future &s;tate, was to per&s;uade us that there was none at all in this. External advantages have been ta|ken for the only goods of human nature; and, becau&s;e, in this view, all things &s;peak the appearance of mal-admini&s;tration, we have been taught to expect a government of recti|tude and benevolence hereafter. Let us, on the contrary, candidly own that virtue is &s;o|vereignly and &s;olely good, le&s;t, by depreciating her charms, we obliquely detract from the character of God him&s;elf. Let us confe&s;s her undowered excellence &s;uperior to all the inconveniences that may attend her, even in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation. But, without allow|ing &s;ome difference between poverty and riches, &s;ickne&s;s and health, pain and plea&s;ure, &amp;c. we &s;hall have no foundation to prefer|ence; and it will be in vain to talk of &s;e|lecting where no one choice can be more a|greeable or di&s;agreeable to nature than ano|ther. Upon this difference, therefore, how|ever it be called, let the pre&s;ent argument proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="64">
If infinite goodne&s;s be the &s;pirit and cha|racteri&s;tic of this univer&s;al government, then every advantage, however incon&s;iderable in kind or degree, mu&s;t either be &s;uppo&s;ed imme|diately be&s;towed on virtue; or, at lea&s;t, that &s;uch retributions will, at &s;ome time, be made her, as may not only render her votaries equal, but &s;uperior to tho&s;e of vice, in proportion to their merit. But how different the ca&s;e is in human life, hi&s;tory and ob&s;ervation may ea|&s;ily convince us; &s;o that one, who&s;e eyes are not intent on the character of God, and the nature of virtue, would often be tempted to think this world a theatre merely intended for mournful &s;pectacles and pomps of horror. How many per&s;ons do we &s;ee peri&s;h by the mere wants of nature, who, had they been in dif|ferent circum&s;tances, would have thanked God with tears of joy for the power of communica|ting tho&s;e advantages they now implore from others in vain? While, at the &s;ame time, they have, perhaps, the additional mi&s;ery of &s;eeing the mo&s;t endeared relations involved in the &s;ame deplorable fate! How often do we &s;ee tho&s;e ties which unite the &s;oul and body, worn out by the gradual advances of a lingering di&s;ea&s;e, or bur&s;t at once by the &s;ud|den efforts of unutterable agony? While the unhappy &s;ufferers, had they been continued in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, might have diffu&s;ed happine&s;s, not only through the narrow circle of their

friends and neighbourhood, but as exten&s;ive|ly as their country, and even the world at large. How many names do we &s;ee buried in ob&s;curity, or &s;oiled with detraction, which ought to have &s;hone the fir&s;t in fame? How many heroes have &s;urvived the liberties of their country, or died in abortive attempts to pre&s;erve them; and, by their fall, only left a larger field for the lawle&s;s ravages of ty|ranny and oppre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>But were it po&s;&s;ible, how long and in&s;upera|ble would be the ta&s;k to enumerate all the ingredients which compo&s;e the pre&s;ent cup of bitterne&s;s? And is this the con&s;ummation of things? Will &s;upreme and e&s;&s;ential good|ne&s;s no way di&s;tingui&s;h &s;uch as have invari|ably pur&s;ued his honour, and the intere&s;t of his government, from tho&s;e who have indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly violated the order he has appointed in things? who have blotted the face of nature with havock, murder, and de&s;olation; and &s;hewn a con&s;tant intention to counteract all the benevolent de&s;igns of providence? It is confe&s;&s;ed that the virtuous, happy in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of virtue alone, make their exit from the pre&s;ent &s;cene with ble&s;&s;ings to the Creator, for having called them to exi&s;tence, and given them the glorious opportunity of enjoying what is in it&s;elf &s;upremely eligible.

<P>The language of religion, and our own hearts, on this important argument, is equally comfortable and deci&s;ive. It accumulates and enforces whatever can in&s;pire us with confi|dence in that God, who is not the God of the dead, but of the living; who reigns in the invi&s;ible, as well as in the vi&s;ible world; and who&s;e attention to our welfare cea&s;es not with our lives, but is commen&s;urate to the full ex|tent of our being. Indeed the votaries of the &s;oul's mortality may as well be hone&s;t for once, and &s;peak out what &s;o many fools think in their hearts. For what is God to us, or we to him, if our connection extends but to the pitiful &s;pace allotted us in &s;uch a pitiful world as this is? To be &s;ure, no ab&s;urdity will be rejected, which can &s;mother the feel|ings, or keep the vices of profligates in coun|tenance; but, if only made like worms and reptiles beneath our feet, to live this moment, and expire the next, to &s;truggle in a wretch|ed life with every internal and external cala|mity,

<P>Suppo&s;e a father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite tenderne&s;s for his &s;on, delighted with his &s;imilarity of form, his promi&s;ing con&s;ti|tution, his &s;trength, gracefulne&s;s, and agility, his undi&s;gui&s;ed emotions of filial affection, with the various pre&s;ages of a &s;uperior geni|us and under&s;tanding.

<P>YES, my Lord, I confe&s;s it; the weight of life is too heavy for my &s;oul. I have long endured it as a burden; I have lo&s;t eve|ry thing which could make it dear to me, and nothing remains but irk&s;omene&s;s and vexation. I am told, however, that I am not at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of my life, without the permi&s;&s;ion of that Being from whom I received it. I am &s;en&s;ible likewi&s;e that you have a right over it by more titles than one. Your care has twice pre&s;erved it, and your goodne&s;s is its con&s;tant &s;ecurity. I will ne|ver
<PB N="68" REF="72">
di&s;po&s;e of it, till I am certain that I may do it without a crime, and till I have not the lea&s;t hope of employing it for your &s;er|vice.</P>
<P>You told me that I &s;hould be of u&s;e to you; why did you deceive me? Since we have been in London, &s;o far from thinking of employ|ing me in your concerns, you have been kind enough to make me your only concern. How &s;uperfluous is your obliging &s;olicitude! My lord, you know I abhor a crime, even wor&s;e than I dete&s;t life; I adore the &s;upreme Being&mdash;I owe every thing to you; I have an affection for you; you are the only per&s;on on earth to whom I am attached. Friend&s;hip and du|ty may chain a wretch to this earth: &s;ophi&s;try and vain pretences will never detain him. En|lighten my under&s;tanding, &s;peak to my heart; I am ready to hear you, but remember, that de&s;pair is not to be impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>You would have me apply to the te&s;t of rea&s;on: I will; let us rea&s;on. You de&s;ire me to deliberate in proportion to the impor|tance
<PB N="69" REF="73">
of the que&s;tion in debate; I agree to it. Let us inve&s;tigate truth with temper and moderation; let us di&s;cu&s;s this general propo|&s;ition with the &s;ame indifference we &s;hould treat any other. Robeck wrote an apology for &s;uicide before he put an end end to his life. I will not, after his example, write a book on the &s;ubject, neither am I well &s;atisfied with that which he has penned, but I hope in this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t to imitate his moderation.</P>
<P>I have for a long time meditated on this awful &s;ubject. You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that I have, for you know my de&s;tiny, and yet I am alive. The more I reflect, the more I am con|vinced that the que&s;tion may be reduced to this fundamental propo&s;ition. Every man has a right by nature to pur&s;ue what he thinks good, and avoid what he thinks evil, in all re&s;pects which are not injurious to others. When our life therefore becomes a mi&s;ery to our|&s;elves, and is of advantage to no one, we are at liberty to put an end to our being. If there is any &s;uch thing as a clear and &s;elf-evident
<PB N="70" REF="74">
principle, certainly this is one, and if this be &s;ubverted, there is &s;carce an action in life which may not be made criminal.</P>
<P>Let us hear what the philo&s;ophers &s;ay on this &s;ubject. Fir&s;t, they con&s;ider life as &s;omething which is not our own, becau&s;e we hold it as a gift; but becau&s;e it has been given to us, is it for that rea&s;on our own? Has not God given the&s;e &s;ophi&s;ts two arms? ne|verthele&s;s, when they are under apprehen&s;i|ons of a mortification, they do not &s;cruple to amputate one, or both if there be occa&s;ion. By a parity of rea&s;oning, we may convince tho&s;e who believe in the immortality of the &s;oul; for if I &s;acrifice my arm to the pre&s;ervation of &s;omething more precious, which is my body, I have the &s;ame right to &s;acrifice my body to the pre&s;ervation of &s;omething more valuable, which is, the happine&s;s of my exi&s;tence. If all the gifts which heaven has be&s;towed are naturally de&s;igned for our good, they are certainly too apt to change their nature; and Providence has endowed us with rea&s;on, that we may di&s;cern the difference. If this rule
<PB N="71" REF="75">
did not authorize us to chu&s;e the one, and re|ject the other, to what u&s;e would it &s;erve a|mong mankind?</P>
<P>But they turn this weak objection into a thou&s;and &s;hapes. They con&s;ider a man li|ving upon earth as a &s;oldier placed on duty. God, &s;ay they, has fixed you in this world, why do you quit your &s;tation without his leave? But you, who argue thus, has he not &s;tationed you in the town where you was born, why therefore do you quit it without his leave? is not mi&s;ery, of it&s;elf, a &s;ufficient permi&s;&s;ion? whatever &s;tation Providence has a&s;&s;igned me, whether it be in a regiment, or on the earth at large, he intended me to &s;tay there while I found my &s;ituation agreeable, and to leave it when it became intolerable. This is the voice of nature, and the voice of God. I agree that we mu&s;t wait for an order; but when I die a na|tural death, God does not order me to quit life, he takes it from me; it is by rendering life in|&s;upportable, that he orders me to quit it. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, I re&s;i&s;t with all my force; in the &s;econd, I have the merit of obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="76">
Can you conceive that there are &s;ome people &s;o ab&s;urd as to arraign &s;uicide as a kind of re|bellion again&s;t Providence, by an attempt to fly from his laws? but we do not put an end to our being in order to withdraw our&s;elves from his commands, but to execute them. What! does the power of God extend no far|ther than to my body? is there a &s;pot in the univer&s;e, is there any being in the univer&s;e, which is not &s;ubject to his power, and will that power have le&s;s immediate influence over me when my being is refined, and thereby be|comes le&s;s compound, and of nearer re&s;em|blance to the divine e&s;&s;ence? no, his ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s are the foundation of my hopes; and if I thought that death would withdraw me from his power, I would give up my re&s;o|lution to die.</P>
<P>This is one of the quibbles of the Phaedo, which, in other re&s;pects, abounds with &s;ublime truths. If your &s;lave de&s;troys him&s;elf, &s;ays Socrates to Cebes, would you not puni&s;h him, for having unju&s;tly deprived you of your pro|perty;
<PB N="73" REF="77">
prithee, good Socrates, do we not be|long to God after we are dead? The ca&s;e you put is not applicable; you ought to argue thus: if you incumber your &s;lave with a habit which confines him from di&s;charging his duty pro|perly, will you puni&s;h him for quitting it, in order to render you better &s;ervice? the grand error lies in making life of too great impor|tance; as if our exi&s;tence depended upon it, and that death was a total annihilation. Our life is of no con&s;equence in the &s;ight of God; it is of no importance in the eyes of rea&s;on, neither ought it to be of any in our &s;ight; when we quit our body, we only lay a&s;ide an incon|venient habit. Is this circum&s;tance &s;o pain|ful, to be the occa&s;ion of &s;o much di&s;turbance? my Lord, the&s;e declaimers are not in earne&s;t. Their arguments are ab&s;urd and cruel, for they aggravate the &s;uppo&s;ed crime, as if it put a pe|riod to exi&s;tence, and they puni&s;h it, as if that exi&s;tence was eternal.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Plato's Phaedo, which has furni&s;hed them with the only &s;pecious argu|ment that has ever been advanced, the que&s;tion
<PB N="74" REF="78">
is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed there in a very light and de&s;ultory manner. Socrates being condemned, by an un|ju&s;t judgment, to lo&s;e his life in a few hours, had no occa&s;ion to enter into an accurate enquiry whether he was at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of it him|&s;elf. Suppo&s;ing him really to have been the author of tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es which Plato a&s;cribes to him, yet believe me, my lord, he would have meditated with more attention on the &s;ub|ject, had he been in circum&s;tances which re|quired him to reduce his &s;peculations to prac|tice; and a &s;trong proof that no valid objec|tion can be drawn from that immortal work again&s;t the right of di&s;po&s;ing of our own lives, is, that Cato read it twice through the very night that he de&s;troyed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ophi&s;ters make it a que&s;tion whe|ther life can ever be an evil? but when we con&s;ider the multitude of errors, torments, and vices, with which it abounds, one would ra|ther be inclined to doubt whether it can ever be a ble&s;&s;ing. Guilt ince&s;&s;antly be&s;ieges the mo&s;t virtuous of mankind. Every moment he lives he is in danger of falling a prey to the wicked, or of being wicked him&s;elf. To
<PB N="75" REF="79">
&s;truggle and to endure, is his lot in this world; that of the di&s;hone&s;t man is to do evil, and to &s;uffer. In every other particular they differ, and only agree in &s;haring the mi|&s;eries of life in common. If you required au|thorities and facts, I could recite you the ora|cles of old, the an&s;wers of the &s;ages, and pro|duce in&s;tances where acts of virtue have been recompen&s;ed with death. But let us leave the&s;e con&s;iderations, my lord; it is to you whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf, and I a&s;k you what is the chief attention of a wi&s;e man in this life, except, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, to collect him&s;elf inwardly, and endeavour, e|ven while he lives, to be dead to every object of &s;en&s;e? The only way by which wi&s;dom di|rects us to avoid the mi&s;eries of human nature, is it not to detach our&s;elves from all earthly objects, from every thing that is gro&s;s in our compo&s;ition, to retire within our&s;elves, and to rai&s;e our thoughts to &s;ublime contemplations? If therefore our misfortunes are derived from our pa&s;&s;ions and errors, with what eagerne&s;s &s;hould we wi&s;h for a &s;tate which will deliver us both from the one and the other? What is
<PB N="76" REF="80">
the fate of tho&s;e &s;ons of &s;en&s;uality, who indi&s;|creetly multiply their torments by their plea|&s;ures? they in fact de&s;troy their exi&s;tence by extending their connections in this life; they increa&s;e the weight of their crimes by their nu|merous attachments; they reli&s;h no enjoy|ments, but what are &s;ucceeded by a thou&s;and bitter wants; the more lively their &s;en&s;ibi|lity, the more acute their &s;ufferings; the &s;tron|ger they are attached to life, the more wretch|ed they become.</P>
<P>But admitting it, in general, a benefit to man|kind to crawl upon the earth with gloomy &s;ad|ne&s;s, I do not mean to intimate that the human race ought with one common con&s;ent to de|&s;troy them&s;elves, and make the world one im|men&s;e grave. But there are mi&s;erable beings, who are too much exalted to be governed by vulgar opinion; to them de&s;pair and grievous torments are the pa&s;&s;ports of nature. It would be as ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e that life can be a ble&s;&s;ing to &s;uch men, as it was ab&s;urd in the &s;ophi&s;ter Po&s;&s;idonius to deny that is was an

While life is agreeable to us, we earne&s;tly wi&s;h to prolong it, and no|thing but a &s;en&s;e of extreme mi&s;ery can extin|gui&s;h the de&s;ire of exi&s;tence; for we natural|ly conceive a violent dread of death, and this dread conceals the mi&s;eries of human nature from our &s;ight. We drag a painful and me|lancholy life, for a long time before we can re&s;olve to quit it; but when once life becomes &s;o in&s;upportable as to overcome the horror of death, then exi&s;tence is evidently a great evil, and we cannot di&s;engage our&s;elves from it too &s;oon. Therefore, though we cannot ex|actly a&s;certain the point at which it cea&s;es to be a ble&s;&s;ing, yet at lea&s;t we are certain that it is an evil long before it appears to be &s;uch, and with every &s;en&s;ible man the right of quit|ting life is, by a great deal, precedent to the temptation.</P>

According to them, it is cowar|dice to withdraw our&s;elves from pain and trouble, and there are none but da&s;tards who de&s;troy them&s;elves. O Rome, thou vic|trix of the world, what a race of cowards did thy empire produce! let Arria, Eponina, Lu|cretia, be of the number; they were women. But Brutus, Ca&s;&s;ius, and thou great and di|vine Cato, who did&s;t &s;hare with the gods the adoration of an a&s;toni&s;hed world, thou who&s;e &s;acred and augu&s;t pre&s;ence animated the Ro|mans with holy zeal, and made tyrants trem|ble, little did thy proud admirers imagine that paltry rhetoricians, immured in the du&s;ty cor|ner of a college, would ever attempt to prove that thou wert a coward, for having preferred death to a &s;hameful exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>O the dignity and energy of your modern writers! how &s;ublime, how intrepid are you with your pens? but tell me, thou great and valiant hero, who do&s;t &s;o courageou&s;ly decline the battle, in order to endure the pain of li|ving &s;omewhat longer; when a &s;park of fire

<P>Without doubt, it is an evidence of great fortitude to bear with firmne&s;s the mi&s;ery which we cannot &s;hun; none but a fool, how|ever, will voluntarily endure evils which he can avoid without a crime; and it is very often a great crime to &s;uffer pain unnece&s;&s;arily.

Come, thou worthy&mdash;out off this leg, which endangers my life.

<P>Weigh the&s;e con&s;iderations, my lord; col|lect the&s;e arguments, and you will find that they may be reduced to the mo&s;t &s;imple of na|ture's rights, of which no man of &s;en&s;e ever yet entertained a doubt. In fact, why &s;hould we be allowed to cure our&s;elves of the gout, and not to get rid of the mi&s;ery of life? do not both evils proceed from the &s;ame hand? to what purpo&s;e is it to &s;ay, that death is painful? are drugs agreeable to be taken? no, nature revolts again&s;t both.

that it is more ju&s;tifiable to cure a tran&s;i|ent di&s;order by the application of remedies, than to free our&s;elves from an incurable evil by putting an end to our life; and let them &s;hew how it can be le&s;s criminal to u&s;e the bark for a fever, than to take opium for the &s;tone.

<P>My lord, I appeal to your wi&s;dom and can|dour; what more infallible maxims can rea|&s;on deduce from religion, with re&s;pect to &s;u|icide? If Chri&s;tians have adopted contrary te|nets, they are neither drawn from the prin|ciples of religion, nor from the only &s;ureguide, the Scriptures, but borrowed from the Pagan philo&s;ophers. Lactantius and Augu&s;tine, the fir&s;t who propagated this new doctrine, of which Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles take no notice, ground their arguments entirely on the rea&s;oning of Phaedo, which I have alrea|dy

controverted; &s;o that the believers, who, in this re&s;pect, think they are &s;upported by the authority of the Go&s;pel, are in fact only countenaced by the authority of Plato. In truth, where do we find, throughout the whole bible any law again&s;t &s;uicide, or &s;o much as a bare di&s;approbation of it; and is it not very unaccountable, that among the in&s;tan|ces produced of per&s;ons who devoted them|&s;elves to death, we do not find the lea&s;t word of improbation again&s;t examples of this kind? nay, what is more, the in&s;tance of Sam&s;on's voluntary death is authorized by a miracle, by which he revenges him&s;elf of his enemies. Would this miracle have been di&s;played to ju&s;tify a crime; and would this man, who lo&s;t his &s;trength by &s;uffering him&s;elf to be &s;educed by the allurements of a woman, have recovered it to commit an authori&s;ed crime, as if God him&s;elf would practice deceit on men?</P>

mu&s;t not de&s;troy malefactors, nor our enemies: and Mo&s;es, who put &s;o many people to death, was a bad interpreter of his own precept. If there are any exceptions, certainly the fir&s;t mu&s;t be in favour of &s;uicide, becau&s;e it is ex|empt from any degree of violence and inju&s;|tice, the two only circum&s;tances which can make homicide criminal; and becau&s;e nature, moreover, has, in this re&s;pect, thrown &s;uffici|ent ob&s;tacles in the way.</P>
<P>But &s;till they tell us, we mu&s;t patiently endure the evils which God inflicts, and make a merit of our &s;ufferings. This appli|cation however of the maxims of Chri&s;tianity, is very ill calculated to &s;atisfy our judgment. Man is &s;ubject to a thou&s;and troubles, his life is a complication of evils, and he &s;eems to have been born only to &s;uffer. Rea&s;on di|rects him to &s;hun as many of the&s;e evils as he can avoid; and religion, which is never in contradiction to rea&s;on, approves of his endea|vours. But how incon&s;iderable is the account of the&s;e evils, in compari&s;on with tho&s;e he is obliged to endure again&s;t his will? It is with
<PB N="86" REF="90">
re&s;pect to the&s;e, that a merciful God allows man to claim the merit of re&s;i&s;tance; he receives the tribute he has been plea&s;ed to impo&s;e, as a voluntary homage, and he places our re&s;igna|tion in this life to our profit in the next. True repentance is derived from nature; if man endures whatever he is obliged to &s;uffer, he does, in this re&s;pect, all that God requires of him; and if any one is &s;o inflated with pride, as to attempt more, he is a madman, who ought to be confined, or an impo&s;tor, who ought to be puni&s;hed. Let us, therefore, with|out &s;cruple, fly from all the evils we can a|void; there will &s;till be too many left for us to endure. Let us, without remor&s;e, quit life it&s;elf when it becomes a torment to us, &s;ince it is in our own power to do it, and that in &s;o doing we neither offend God nor man. If we would offer a &s;acrifice to the &s;upreme Being, is it nothing to undergo death? let us devote to God that which he demands by the voice of rea&s;on, and into his hands let us peaceably &s;urrender our &s;ouls.</P>

What makes our opinion in this particular dubious, is the example of Robeck, which he cites, and which &s;eems to warrant his own.

<P>Why &s;hould we delay doing that which we mu&s;t do at la&s;t? &s;hall we wait till old age and decrepid ba&s;ene&s;s attach us to life, after they have robbed it of its charms, and till we are doomed to drag an infirm and decrepid body with labour, and ignominy, and pain? We are at an age when the &s;oul has vigour to di&s;|engage it&s;elf with ea&s;e from its &s;hackles, and when a man knows how to die as he ought; when farther advanced in years, he &s;uffers him&s;elf to be torn from life, which he quits with reluctance.

<P>But let us wave all general maxims, about which we often hold violent di&s;putes, with|out adopting any of them in practice; for in their applications we always find &s;ome parti|cular circum&s;tances which makes &s;uch an al|teration in the &s;tate of things, that every one thinks him&s;elf di&s;pen&s;ed from &s;ubmitting to the rules which he pre&s;cribes to others; and it is well known, that every man who e&s;ta|bli&s;hes

longer they continue, and at length utterly de&s;troy this mortal machine. The former, on the contrary, being only external and tran&s;ito|ry modifications of an immortal and uncom|pounded e&s;&s;ence, are in&s;en&s;ibly effaced, and leave the mind in its original form, which is not &s;u&s;ceptible of alteration. Grief, di&s;quie|tude, regret, and de&s;pair, are evils of &s;hort du|ration, which never take root in the mind; and experience always fal&s;ifies that bitter re|flection, which makes us imagine our mi&s;ery will have no end. I will go farther; I can|not imagine that the vices which contaminate us, are more inherent in our nature than the troubles we endure; I not only believe that they peri&s;h with the body which gives them birth, but I think, beyond all doubt, that a lon|ger life would be &s;ufficient to reform mankind, and that many ages of youth would teach us that nothing is preferable to virtue.</P>
<P>However this may be, as the greate&s;t part of our phy&s;ical evils are ince&s;&s;antly encrea&s;ing, the acute pains of the body, when they are in|curable, may ju&s;tify a man's de&s;troying him|&s;elf;

<P>But it is otherwi&s;e with the afflictions of the mind, which, let them be ever &s;o acute, always carry their remedy with them. In fact, what is it that makes any evil intolerable? Nothing but its duration. The operations of &s;urgery are generally much more painful than the di&s;orders they cure; but the pain occa&s;ion|ed by the latter is la&s;ting, that of the operati|on is momentary, and therefore preferable. What occa&s;ion is there therefore for any ope|ration to remove troubles which die of cour&s;e by their duration, the only circum&s;tance which could render them in&s;upportable? Is it rea&s;onable to apply &s;uch de&s;perate reme|dies to evils which expire of them&s;elves? To a man who values him&s;elf on his fortitude,

and who e&s;timates years at their real value, of two ways by which he may extricate him&s;elf from the &s;ame troubles, which will appear preferable, death or time? Have patience, and you will be cured. What would you de&s;ire more?</P>
<P>Oh! you will &s;ay, it doubles my afflictions to reflect that they will cea&s;e at la&s;t! This is the vain &s;ophi&s;try of grief! an apoph|thegm void of rea&s;on, of propriety, and per|haps of &s;incerity. What an ab&s;urd mo|tive of de&s;pair is the hope of terminating mi|&s;ery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No, my lord, we do not put an end to mi&s;ery by the&s;e means, but rather fill the mea&s;ure of affliction, by bur&s;ting a|&s;under the la&s;t ties which attach us to felicity. When we regret what was dear to us, grief it&s;elf &s;till attaches us to the object we lament, which is a &s;tate le&s;s deplorable than to be attached to nothing.</NOTE>! Even allowing this fanta&s;tical reflec|tion, who would not chu&s;e to encrea&s;e the pre|&s;ent pain for a moment, under the a&s;&s;urance of putting an end to it, as we &s;carify a wound in order to heal it? and admitting any charm in grief, to make us in love with &s;uf|fering,
<PB N="100" REF="104">
when we relea&s;e our&s;elves from it by putting an end to our being, do we not at that in&s;tant incur all that we apprehend here|after?</P>
<P>Reflect thoroughly, young man; what are ten, twenty, thirty years, in competition with immortality? Pain and plea&s;ure pa&s;s like a &s;hadow; life &s;lides away in an in&s;tant; it is nothing of it&s;elf; its value depends on the u&s;e we make of it. The good that we have done is all that remains, and it is that alone which marks its importance.</P>
<P>Therefore do not &s;ay any more that your exi&s;tence is an evil, &s;ince it depends upon your&s;elf to make it a ble&s;&s;ing; and if it be an evil to have lived, this is an additional rea&s;on for prolonging life. Do not pretend neither to &s;ay any more that you are at liberty to die; for it is as much as to &s;ay that you have pow|er to alter your nature, that you have a right to revolt again&s;t the author of your being, and to fru&s;trate the end of your exi&s;tence. But when you add, that your death does injury to
<PB N="101" REF="105">
no one, do you recollect that you make this declaration to your friend?</P>
<P>Your death does injury to no one? I un|der&s;tand you! You think the lo&s;s I &s;hall &s;u&s;|tain by your death of no importance; you deem my affliction of no con&s;equence. I will urge to you no more the rights of friend&s;hip, which you de&s;pi&s;e; but are there not obliga|tions &s;till more dear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Obligations more dear than tho&s;e of friend&s;hip! Is it a philo&s;opher who talks thus? But this affected &s;ophi&s;t was of an amorous di&s;po&s;ition.</NOTE>, which ought to in|duce you to pre&s;erve your life? If there be a per&s;on in the world who loved you to that de|gree as to be unwilling to &s;urvive you, and who&s;e happine&s;s depends on yours, do you think that you have no obligations to her? Will not the execution of your wicked de&s;ign di&s;turb the peace of a mind, which has been with &s;uch difficulty re&s;tored to its former in|nocence? Are not you afraid to add fre&s;h tor|ments to a heart of &s;uch &s;en&s;ibility? Are not you apprehen&s;ive left your death &s;hould be at|tended
<PB N="102" REF="106">
with a lo&s;s more fatal, which would deprive the world and virtue it&s;elf of its bright|e&s;t ornament? And if &s;he &s;hould &s;urvive you, are not you afraid to rou&s;e up remor&s;e in her bo&s;om, which is more grievous to &s;upport than life it&s;elf? Thou ungrateful friend! thou indelicate lover! wilt thou always be taken up wholly with thy&s;elf? Wilt thou al|ways think on thy own troubles alone? Ha&s;t thou no regard for the happine&s;s of one who was &s;o dear to thee? and cannot thou re&s;olve to live for her who was willing to die with thee?</P>
<P>You talk of the duties of a magi&s;trate, and of a father of a family; and becau&s;e you are not under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, you think your|&s;elf ab&s;olutely free. And are you then under no obligations to &s;ociety, to whom you are indebted for your pre&s;ervation, your talents, your under&s;tanding? do you owe nothing to your native country, and to tho&s;e unhappy people who may need your exi&s;tence! O what an accurate calculation you make! a|mong the obligations you have enumerated,
<PB N="103" REF="107">
you have only omitted tho&s;e of a man and of a citizen. Where is the virtuous patriot, who refu&s;ed to enli&s;t under a foreign prince, becau&s;e his blood ought not to be &s;pilt but in the &s;ervice of his country; and who now, in a fit of de&s;pair, is ready to &s;hed it again&s;t the ex|pre&s;s prohibition of the laws? The laws, the laws, young man! did any wi&s;e man ever de&s;pi&s;e them? Socrates, though innocent, out of regard to them refu&s;ed to quit his pri|&s;on. You do not &s;cruple to violate them by quitting life unju&s;tly; and you a&s;k, what in|jury do I?</P>
<P>You endeavour to ju&s;tify your&s;elf by ex|ample. You pre&s;ume to mention the Romans: you talk of the Romans! it becomes you indeed to cite tho&s;e illu&s;trious names. Tell me, did Brutus die a lover in de&s;pair, and did Cato plunge the dagger in his brea&s;t for his mi&s;tre&s;s? Thou weak and abject man! what re&s;emblance is there between Cato and thee? Shew me the common &s;tandard be|tween that &s;ublime &s;oul and thine. Ah vain wretch! hold thy peace: I am afraid to pro|fane

his name by a vindication of his conduct. At that augu&s;t and &s;acred name every friend to virtue &s;hold bow to the ground, and honour the memory of the greate&s;t hero in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>How ill you have &s;elected your examples, and how meanly you judge of the Romans, if you imagine that they thought them&s;elves at liberty to quit life &s;o &s;oon as it became a bur|den to them. Recur to the excellent days of that republic, and &s;ee whether you will find a &s;ingle citizen of virtue, who thus freed him|&s;elf from the di&s;charge of his duty even after the mo&s;t cruel misfortunes. When Regulus was on his return to Carthage, did he prevent the torments which he knew were preparing for him by de&s;troying him&s;elf? What would not Po&s;thumus have given, when obliged to pa&s;s under the yoke at Caudium, had this re|&s;ource been ju&s;tifiable? How much did e|ven the &s;enate admire that effort of courage, which enabled the con&s;ul Varro to &s;urvive his defeat? For what rea&s;on did &s;o many gene|rals voluntary &s;urrender them&s;elves to their e|nemies, they to whom ignominy was &s;o dread|ful,
<PB N="105" REF="109">
and who were &s;o little afraid of dying? It was becau&s;e they con&s;idered their blood, their life, and their late&s;t breath, as devoted to their country; and neither &s;hame nor misfortune could di&s;|&s;uade them from this &s;acred duty. But when the laws were &s;ubverted, and the &s;tate became a prey to tyranny, the citizens re&s;umed their natural liberty, and the right they had over their own lives. When Rome was no more, it was lawful for the Romans to give up their lives; they had di&s;charged their duties on earth, they had no longer any country to defend, they were therefore at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of their lives, and to obtain that freedom for them|&s;elves which they could not recover for their country. After having &s;pent their days in the &s;ervice of expiring Rome, and in fight|ing for the defence of its laws, they died great and virtuous as they had lived, and their death was an additional tribute to the glory of the Roman name, &s;ince none of them beheld a &s;ight above all others mo&s;t di&s;honourable, that of a true citizen &s;tooping to an u&s;urper.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="110">
But thou, what art thou? what ha&s;t thou done? do&s;t thou think to excu&s;e thy&s;elf on ac|count of thy ob&s;curity? does thy weakne&s;s exempt thee from thy duty, and becau&s;e thou ha&s;t neither rank nor di&s;tinction in thy coun|try, art thou le&s;s &s;ubject to the laws? It becomes you va&s;tly to pre&s;ume to talk of dy|ing, while you owe the &s;ervice of your life to your equals. Know, that a death, &s;uch as you meditate, is &s;hameful and &s;urreptitious. It is a theft committed on mankind in general. Before you quit life, return the benefits you have received from every individual. But, &s;ay you, I have no attachments; I am u&s;ele&s;s in the world. O thou young philo&s;opher! art thou ignorant that thou can&s;t not move a &s;ingle &s;tep without finding &s;ome duty to ful|fil; and that every man is u&s;eful to &s;ociety, even by means of his exi&s;tence alone?</P>
<P>Hear me, thou ra&s;h young man! thou art dear to me. I commi&s;erate thy errors. If the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of virtue &s;till remains in thy brea&s;t, attend, and let me teach thee to be re|conciled

to life. Whenever thou art temp|ted to quit it, &s;ay to thy&s;elf&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me do at lea&s;t one good action before I die."</Q> Then go in &s;earch for one in a &s;tate of indi|gence, whom thou maye&s;t relieve; for one un|der misfortunes, whom thou maye&s;t comfort; for one under oppre&s;&s;ion, whom thou maye&s;t defend. Introduce to me tho&s;e unhappy wretches whom my rank keeps at a di&s;tance. Do not be afraid of mi&s;u&s;ing my parle, or my credit: make free with them; di&s;tribute my fortune; make me rich. If this con&s;idera|tion re&s;trains you to-day, it will re&s;train you to-morrow; if to morrow, it will re&s;train you all your life. If it has no power to re&s;train you, die! you are below my care.</P>
