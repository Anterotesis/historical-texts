<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE ACADEMY OF ANCIENT MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE Academy of Ancient Mu&s;ic, at the Crown and Anchor-Tavern, in the Strand, was in&s;tituted about the year 1710, by a number of Gen|tlemen, performers on different in&s;truments, in conjunction with &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent ma&s;ters of the time. The de&s;ign of this e&s;tabli&s;hment was to promote the &s;tudy and practice of vocal and in|&s;trumental
<PB N="4" REF="3">
harmony; in order to which, the foundation of a library was laid, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t celebrated compo&s;itions, as well in manu&s;cript as in print, that could be procured, either at home or abroad.</P>
<P>Under the direction of the late Dr. <HI>John Chri&s;topher Pepu&s;ch,</HI> who&s;e memory will be ever revered by all lovers of mu&s;ic, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Galliard,</HI> Dr. <HI>Maurice Greene,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bernard Gates,</HI> and the gentlemen and boys of St. Paul's Cathedral, and the Chapel Royal, the Academy continued in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate, till about the year 1728, when Dr. <HI>Greene</HI> thought proper to leave it, and &s;et up an Academy at the Devil-Tavern, Temple-bar, which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted but a few years.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">The &s;ece&s;&s;ion of Dr. <HI>Greene</HI> and his dependents was not &s;uch an injury to the Academy, as it was feared it would prove: they left it, it is true, but they left it in peace, and the members of which it was compo&s;ed, in con&s;equence of the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained, became emulous to excel each other in their endeavours to promote its in|tere&s;ts, and to di&s;&s;eminate the love of harmony throughout the king|dom.</P>
<P>With the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances, and that which the Academy derived from the performance of the amiable <HI>Henry Needler,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who for many years led the orche&s;tra, the late Earl of <HI>Abercorn,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mul&s;o,</HI> Mr. <HI>Millan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dob&s;on,</HI> and many other gentlemen, who were excel|lent performers, it continued to
<PB N="6" REF="5">
flouri&s;h until the year 1734, when Mr. <HI>Gates</HI> retired, and drew off with him the children of the Chapel Royal.</P>
<P>In the interval between the &s;e|ce&s;&s;ion of Dr. <HI>Greene</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gates,</HI> viz. in the Month of February 1731-2, the Academy had given a &s;ignal proof of the advantages ari&s;ing from its in&s;titution: the Oratorio of E&s;ther, originally com|po&s;ed for the duke of <HI>Chandois,</HI> was performed in character by the members of the Academy, and the children of the Chapel Royal, and the applau&s;e with which it was received, &s;ugge&s;ted to Mr. <HI>Handel,</HI> the thought of exhibiting that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition at Covent-Garden theatre; and to this event it may be &s;aid to be owing, that the public have not only been de|lighted
<PB N="7" REF="6">
with the hearing, but are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable works of that great ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s which the Academy &s;u&s;tained by the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of &s;ome members, the death of others, and above all by the want of boys, laid them under great difficulties, and drove them to the nece&s;&s;ity of try|ing what could be done without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of treble voices; but the experience of one &s;ea&s;on drove them to the alternative of an en|crea&s;ed expence, or annihilation. In this predicament they re&s;olved upon an expedient that &s;hould not only make good the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained, but convey a benefit to po&s;terity. In &s;hort, they deter|mined upon &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd &s;uch a &s;ub&s;cription, as would
<PB N="8" REF="7">
render the Academy at once a &s;o|ciety for the entertainment of its members, and a &s;eminary for the in&s;truction of youth in the prin|ciples of mu&s;ic, and the laws of harmony. Invitations to parents, and offers of &s;uch an education for their children, as would fit them as well for trades and bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, as the profe&s;&s;ion of mu&s;ic, were given by adverti&s;ements in the public papers: the&s;e brought in a great number of children, and &s;uch of them as were likely to be made capable of performing the <HI>Soprano</HI> part in vocal compo&s;itions, were retained; Dr. <HI>Pepu&s;ch</HI> generou&s;ly undertook the care of their in&s;truc|tion for a &s;tipend, the large&s;t the Academy could afford, tho' greatly di&s;proportionate to his merit, and &s;ucceeded &s;o well in his endeavours to improve them, that &s;ome of the
<PB N="9" REF="8">
mo&s;t eminent profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;cience owe their &s;kill and reputation to his ma&s;terly method of tuition.</P>
<P>A &s;ub&s;cription of two guineas, and a re&s;olution to admit auditors as members, enabled the managers to carry this their benevolent de|&s;ign into execution: they enriched their collection with &s;uch a variety of compo&s;itions as rendered it even then, perhaps, the mo&s;t valuable repo&s;itory of mu&s;ical trea&s;ure in Europe. Abbate <HI>Steffani</HI> tran&s;mit|ted to them from Hanover, the mo&s;t valuable of his works from time to time, as they were compo&s;ed. Mr. <HI>Handel</HI> and Signor <HI>Geminiani,</HI> lent the Academy their countenance, the latter frequently honouring it with his own exqui&s;ite perform|ance, and it continued to flouri&s;h till the year 1752, when it &s;u&s;tained
<PB N="10" REF="9">
a lo&s;s which will be long deplored in the death of Dr. <HI>Pepu&s;ch,</HI> and which was far from being repaired by his generous benefaction to it of the mo&s;t valuable part of his library.</P>
<P>Soon after this melancholy event, &s;ome of the members of the Aca|demy, reflecting on the great en|couragement given to <HI>Concerts,</HI> thought it might tend to the in|tere&s;t of the Society, to give it a new form, and by engaging &s;ome of the mo&s;t excellent performers on particular in&s;truments, derive a&s;&s;i&s;tance to it as a <HI>Concert,</HI> from per&s;ons who might be apt to di&s;|regard it as an <HI>Academy.</HI> But here they were involved in a new diffi|culty: the great increa&s;e of late years in the number of places of public diver&s;ion, and the con&s;e|quent
<PB N="11" REF="10">
increa&s;e in the demands of eminent performers, made it im|po&s;&s;ible, even with a &s;ub&s;cription of two guineas and a half, to con|tinue a competition again&s;t greater re&s;ources than private contribution, and they now find, that the&s;e latter are not adequate to the expence of the plan which they la&s;t adopted.</P>
<P>The members of the Academy therefore find them&s;elves reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of recurring to the principles of its fir&s;t in&s;titution, and they de&s;ire, if po&s;&s;ible, to per|petuate the exi&s;tence of a Society calculated for the improvement of one of the noble&s;t of the &s;ciences, and the communication of rational and &s;ocial delight, to which end they wi&s;h for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e, who profe&s;s to love and admire mu&s;ic; &s;uch as are &s;u&s;ceptible of its powers,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
&s;uch in &s;hort as are capable of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing between the feeble efforts of &s;imple melody, and the irre|&s;i&s;tible charms of elegant modula|tion and well-&s;tudied harmony.</P>
<P>The friends of this in&s;titution are &s;en&s;ible of the prejudices which its very name, The Academy of Ancient Mu&s;ic, may excite; and that tho&s;e per&s;ons, who think no mu&s;ic can be good which is not <HI>new,</HI> will hardly be induced to join in the &s;upport of an e&s;tabli&s;hment, pro|fe&s;&s;edly intended for the &s;tudy and practice of that which is <HI>old.</HI></P>
<P>To obviate prejudices of this kind, little more is nece&s;&s;ary than barely to &s;tate them: tho&s;e now under con&s;ideration are reducible to the following two po&s;itions:</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12" MS="y"><Q>Nothing in mu&s;ic is e&s;timable, that is not new. No mu&s;ic tolerable, which has been heard before.</Q></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to which it may be &s;aid, that this kind of rea&s;oning is never applied to other intellectual gratifications; for no man was ever yet &s;o weak as to object to the works of <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Raffa&euml;lle,</HI> that the one wrote &s;eventeen hundred, or that the other painted two hundred and fifty years ago.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, nothing more is meant by the objection, than that <Q>the efficacy of mu&s;ic is abated by repetition.</Q></P>
<P>Not to enquire what kind of mu|&s;ic that mu&s;t be, the merit where|of evaporates in the performance, let it be a&s;ked, does any man for|bear
<PB N="14" REF="13">
the peru&s;al of an Epic Poem, merely becau&s;e he has read it be|fore? or does any admirer of Paint|ing or Sculpture withdraw his eye from a fine Picture or Statue, be|cau&s;e it has once &s;urveyed them? Nay, rather, does he not employ all his attention to explore their &s;everal beauties, and in the exerci&s;e of a learned curio&s;ity find continual de|light?</P>
<P>Again, let it be a&s;ked, are the&s;e objections to the be&s;t mu&s;ic of the be&s;t times, founded in truth and experience, or are they the re&s;ult of a vicious ta&s;te and a depraved judgment? Much of the mu&s;ic now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Academy is as new to us as it was to our fathers; and will any one in his &s;ober &s;en&s;es a&s;&s;ert, that they had not ears and rational &s;ouls as well as our&s;elves?
<PB N="15" REF="14">
or that tho&s;e &s;weet interchanges of melody, tho&s;e artful combinations of concordant &s;ounds, which in|&s;pired &s;uch men as <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI> with the prai&s;es of this divine &s;cience, can at any time be heard with indifference by a nice and unprejudiced ear? If this be the ca&s;e, mu&s;ic, the principles where|of &s;eem interwoven in the very con|&s;titution of the univer&s;e, is mere delu&s;ion, and the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from it, re&s;olvable into caprice, fa&s;hion, into any thing but rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Farther, let it be enquired, how far the love of novelty has contri|buted to the <HI>variety</HI> of mu&s;ic, and it will be found to have excluded &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable kinds of compo&s;ition, and thereby pro|duced <HI>uniformity</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>variety.</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
Every judge of mu&s;ic is aware of the effects of compo&s;itions in the <HI>minor</HI> third of the &s;everal keys, and that by the hearing of &s;uch the &s;weete&s;t &s;en&s;ations are excited; and the artful contexture of <HI>fugue</HI> and <HI>canon</HI> are the admiration of all who are &s;killed in the &s;cience: The&s;e two kinds of mu&s;ic are in danger of being lo&s;t; for the compo&s;itions of this day are almo&s;t &s;olely in the <HI>major</HI> third, and their &s;tructure little better than divided counter|point, and what is &s;till wor&s;e, on a <HI>monotonic</HI> ba&s;s; nor are the com|po&s;itions, which &s;ome affect to ad|mire, le&s;s liable to the objection of uniformity in re&s;pect to their &s;everal <HI>divi&s;ions</HI> or &s;trains: For rea&s;ons, which no one is willing to avow, Adagio-Mu&s;ic is exploded, and we are con|tent to forego the Maje&s;ty and Dig|nity of the <HI>Largo</HI> and <HI>Andant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
movements, with all the variety ari&s;ing from the interchange of dif|ferent airs and mea&s;ures, for the noi&s;e and rattle of an uni&s;onus <HI>Allegro,</HI> to which no name can be given, or the intoxicating &s;oftne&s;s of that too oft iterated air, the <HI>Minuet.</HI></P>
<P>He that reflects on &s;uch in&s;tances of modern Levity as the&s;e, and that the effect of new productions is &s;uch as that no one pretends, or even wi&s;hes, to remember the mu&s;ic that plea&s;ed him a month ago, may very rea&s;onably demand, who are the com|petitors with the compo&s;ers of the la&s;t century, and the former half of the pre&s;ent? or of which of them can it be &s;aid, that his crudities are le&s;s evane&s;cent than the form of a cloud, or that his mo&s;t laboured &s;tudies have &s;urvived the fate of an almanac?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">But le&s;t it &s;hould be imagined, that an unwarrantable fondne&s;s for antiquity is the motive with the Academy for the cultivation of ancient mu&s;ic, they de&s;ire it may be under&s;tood, that they apply the epithet <HI>ancient</HI> to the compo&s;itions of the <HI>&s;ixteenth</HI> century <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In order to under&s;tand the rea&s;on of this re|&s;triction, it is nece&s;&s;ary to advert to the hi&s;tory of mu&s;ic, which, &s;o far as is material to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, is this. About the year 1500, <HI>Gafurius,</HI> or as he is otherwi&s;e called <HI>Franchinus,</HI> a native of Lodi in Italy, having with great pains and expence pro|cured copies and tran&s;lations of <HI>Ari&s;tides Quintilianus, Bacchius Senioris, Manuel Bryennius, Ptolomey,</HI> and others of the Greek Mu&s;icians, and, having thoroughly &s;tu|died <HI>Boetius</HI> and <HI>Guido Aretinus,</HI> red lectures on mu&s;ic in the public &s;chools of Mantua, Verona, Milan, and other provinces and cities in Italy. The Proven&ccedil;al <HI>violars</HI> and <HI>mu&s;ars</HI> were almo&s;t the only compo&s;ers and mu&s;icians of the preceding ages; but the know|ledge of the &s;cience which <HI>Gafurius</HI> diffu&s;ed through|out Italy, gave ri&s;e to a new &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, of which, under the patronage of the Roman Pontiffs, <HI>Pale&s;trina</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the improver, if not the inventor; the nature whereof is be&s;t to be judged of by his motet <HI>Exaltabo te, Domine,</HI> and his no le&s;s excellent madrigal, <HI>Veramente in amore.</HI> He was organi&s;t and chapel-ma&s;ter of St. Peter at Rome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd flouri&s;hed about the year 1580. The improve|ments in mu&s;ic &s;ince his time, con&s;i&s;t in the a&s;&s;ociat|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng in&s;truments with voices, and the invention of new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ombinations, which, without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">f harmony, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be capable of an almo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">finite variety.</NOTE>, and that
<PB N="19" REF="18">
they carry their re&s;earches no far|ther back than the time when <HI>Pale&s;trina</HI> and his contempora|ries, tho&s;e glorious luminaries of the mu&s;ical world, attracted the admiration of the able&s;t judges, and that they have ever paid a &s;e|dulous attention to &s;uch productions as their intrin&s;ic merit has at any period rendered worthy of regard.</P>
<P>After &s;o much care and pains taken to enrich it, it will hardly be objected to the Academy col|lection of mu&s;ic, that it is deficient in variety: and when it is known
<PB N="20" REF="19">
that the countries of Italy, Germa|ny, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and England, have &s;everally contri|buted, and that very largely, to the forming it, very little dread will re|main of that &s;atiety or indifference which attends the hearing of mu|&s;ic calculated for the <HI>pre&s;ent hour,</HI> and not intended for po&s;terity. For not to mention the great num|ber of compo&s;itions which the Aca|demy are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, even &s;o great as that the younge&s;t per&s;on now living might hope in vain to hear them all, nor that variety of &s;tile ob&s;ervable in them, which is the characteri&s;tic of different ma&s;ters, every &s;pecies of vocal and in&s;tru|mental mu&s;ic is in its turn exhi|bited by the Academy in the enter|tainment of its members: the ge|neral arrangement of the&s;e is into compo&s;itions for the <HI>church,</HI> the
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<HI>theatre,</HI> and the <HI>chamber</HI>; the fir&s;t head includes Ma&s;&s;es, Motets, An|thems, Hymns, and P&s;alms: the &s;econd, Oratorio's, Ma&s;ques, Serena|tas, Overtures, and Concerto's; and the third, Madrigals, Trio's, Duet|to's, and Cantata's; to the true and ju&s;t performance whereof the Aca|demy have hitherto been, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they now &s;oli|cit, tru&s;t they &s;hall yet be, equal.</P>
<P>The hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e their endeavours ari&s;e from that propen&s;ity which they ob&s;erve in people of this country to the cul|tivation of the politer arts, and the general encouragement it affords to laudable pur&s;uits. They behold, with plea&s;ure, per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank in this kingdom a&s;&s;ociated for the improvement of a particular &s;pecies of vocal harmony, and with
<PB N="22" REF="21">
exemplary munificence di&s;pen&s;ing rewards proportioned to the merit of &s;uch, as are emulous to excel in it. Farther, they repo&s;e great confidence in the good &s;en&s;e of this nation, of which they have a con|vincing proof in the re&s;pect, which, for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, has been paid to the works of our great Dramatic Poet of <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s days, who&s;e be&s;t compo&s;itions, by the way, are as liable to reproach on the &s;core of their antiquity, as any of tho&s;e which the Academy have long laboured to recommend. In &s;hort, they flatter them&s;elves, that the &s;tudies of &s;uch men as <HI>Pale|&s;trina, Tallis, Bird, Cari&s;&s;mi, Co|lonna, Stradella, Purcell, Ba&s;&s;ani, Ga&s;parini, Lotti, Steffani, Marcello, Buononcini, Pergole&s;i, Handel, Perez,</HI> and many others, abounding in evidences of the deepe&s;t &s;kill and
<PB N="23" REF="22">
fine&s;t invention, when duly attended to, will be thought worthy the ad|miration of every mu&s;ical ear, and afford a manly and rational de|light to all the votaries of this noble &s;cience.</P>
<P>A &s;ociety founded on principles like the&s;e, can hardly fail of prov|ing an inexhau&s;tible fund of bene|fit and entertainment. Here the &s;tudent in the mu&s;ical faculty will find the means of forming his &s;tile after the mo&s;t perfect models. Here the timid and mode&s;t performer may acquire that degree of firmne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd confidence which is nece&s;&s;ary for di&s;playing his excellencies in public. Here the ingenuous youth, who prefers the innocent plea&s;ures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">f mu&s;ic to riot and intemperance, may ta&s;te of that mirth which draws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o repentance after it; and hither
<PB N="24" REF="23">
may tho&s;e repair to whom the &s;tu|dies or labours of a day mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily endear the elegant delights of a mu&s;ical evening.</P>
<P>Padre <HI>Paolo Sarpi,</HI> re&s;igned his breath with a prayer for the Re|public of Venice, which it is to be hoped every friend of the Mu&s;es, applying it to the Academy of Ancient Mu&s;ic, will adopt; and in the words of that excellent man cry out,</P>
