<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THOSE who devote them|&s;elves to POETRY, have but one Way of paying the highe&s;t Favours; their Returns are only the Fruits of that Art which they cultivate; and they might well be|wail this as a Partiality in Nature, were not the Gifts of Genius &s;ome|times beyond tho&s;e of Fortune. Men who, like your Self, can give Eter|nity to Names they honour, have no Rea&s;on to complain of the Mu&s;es: But &s;uch as we, who have it in our
<PB REF="4">
Wills to be grateful, and are &s;hor|ten'd in the only Powers we have to &s;hew it, feel greater Unea&s;ine&s;s from Obligations, than is ea&s;y to be ex|pre&s;s'd. In &s;uch a Situation, we have nothing left, but our Attempts to plea&s;e; and the&s;e your &s;uperior Geniuses mu&s;t look upon rather as a Homage, than a Return; the Effects of our good Wi&s;hes, rather than the Accompli&s;hment of our De&s;ires.</P>
<P>NEXT to being eminent in one's own Character, to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Men of Excellence, is the happie&s;t Prai&s;e; and as one of the&s;e is very often introductory to the other, &s;o has it happen'd to you; the <HI>Greate&s;t Men</HI> among us fir&s;t ob&s;erv'd and che|ri&s;h'd your Merit, and you &s;oon re|turn'd the Acknowledgment, by ma|king that Merit u&s;eful and orna|mental to your Country. What a noble Te&s;timony do your living Vir|tues give to the Di&s;cernment of the late Lord <HI>HALIFAX!</HI> that Great Man had the peculiar Happine&s;s of
<PB REF="5">
making Wit and Learning not only a Qualification for his Friend&s;hip, but of Service to the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Management of publick Affairs. The Familiarity you have always enter|tain'd with the fir&s;t Men of Letters, and the Applau&s;e with which you have acted, and &s;till continue to act, in the Sphere of Bu&s;ine&s;s, are equal|ly to your Honour, and have &s;et your Character as much above Flat|tery, as Detraction.</P>
<P>FOR my Part, it has always been my Ambition to de&s;ire the good Opi|nion of Men of your Turn; and I never have, or &s;hall be a&s;ham'd of publi&s;hing the Virtues of tho&s;e who have been eminent in their Services for our KING, Country, and Legal Con&s;titution; and in this View (if any Thing of mine can reach &s;o far) would I be look'd upon by Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, I cannot but congratulate my Country for breed|ing &s;uch gallant free Spirits, who,
<PB REF="6">
like your Self, have ro&s;e up in Op|po&s;ition to the two mo&s;t implacable Powers that can be let loo&s;e upon Mankind, <HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Popery.</HI> It is your Prai&s;e, Sir, to have acted a mo&s;t noble Part on this Account, in the <HI>Iri&s;h Senate;</HI> a Country more than once the Scene of the mo&s;t dreadful Ma&s;&s;acres, but now, by the Actions of YOU and your fellow PATRIOTS, happily recover'd from the &s;ame threat'ning (and oh! too near) im|pending Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>SUCH publick Services as the&s;e, tho' they give Joy and Ble&s;&s;ings to a whole Nation, yet they more nearly affect tho&s;e who have a Share in your E&s;teem. Among the great Number that your Merit have made your Friends, I am proud to be ac|counted one, and to have it known to the World, I had your Per|mi&s;&s;ion to prefix your Name to this TRAGEDY. I &s;hall be very neg|ligent with the Criticks, and &s;et my Heart at Re&s;t on Account of the En|vious,
<PB REF="7">
if it has the good Fortune in the lea&s;t to plea&s;e, and divert one Hour of your Retirement. It comes to you with &s;incere Wi&s;hes for a happy <HI>New-Year,</HI> for a long and un|interrupted Health; and that you may remain, what now you are, an Ornament to the Po&s;t you fill, and Ble&s;&s;ing to the Nation you are hap|pily planted in, are the hearty Wi&s;hes and Prayers of,</P>
