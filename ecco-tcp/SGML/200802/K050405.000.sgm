<HEAD>AN ATTEMPT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IT is not for Want of having &s;eriou&s;ly reflected upon the utter Ab&s;urdity there is, in endeavouring to remove any Prejudice whatever that I have undertaken the pre&s;ent Performance; I am too &s;en&s;ible my&s;elf of the Satisfaction there is, in giving an ab&s;olute Credit to any Thing, only becau&s;e it is doubtful, or improbable, to think of depriving any Body el&s;e, were it in my Power, of &s;uch glo|rious U&s;e of the rea&s;oning Faculty; nor is it from any particular Affection I bear the <HI>illu&s;trious Per&s;on</HI> I am attempting to ju&s;tify, &s;ince, &s;o far from having received any Favour at his Hands or owing him any Obligation whatever, (unle&s;s one could be weak enough to reckon the Enjoyment of Liberty, Life,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
and Religion, &s;uch a Debt, which even in that Ca&s;e would be due to him from me, only in common with every <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>) that it is not many years, &s;ince his <HI>R&mdash; H&mdash;</HI> follow'd &s;ome <HI>Birds</HI> through a <HI>Feild</HI> belonging to a Tenant of mine, ju&s;t before the Eddi&s;h was cut, yet no Offer of any kind of Recompence has to this Day been made, the <HI>Reader</HI> may be &s;ure none was ever a&s;k'd; this I hope is enough to clear me from any Shadow of Su&s;picion of being in the lea&s;t bia&s;s'd in his Favour. I have never before ventured to make any Complaint of this Matter publick, even at a Time when the <HI>World</HI> mu&s;t do me the Ju&s;tice to own it has been troubled with Cries enough again&s;t his <HI>R&mdash; H&mdash;</HI> of a le&s;s greivous Nature. As to any Expectations of in&s;inua|ting my&s;elf into his Favour, by writing on this Side of the Que&s;tion, I believe the Manner, in which I have ventured to treat this Subject, lies manife&s;tly &s;o wide of any Road leading to the Favour of the Great, as to &s;ecure me, with all di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate People, from being &s;o hardly thought of. But (to clo&s;e the Paragraph and Sen&s;e, which by this Time I fancy the gentle Reader may be out of Breath for) it is from a Weakne&s;s I have long labour'd again&s;t to no Purpo&s;e, a na|tural Love to Ju&s;tice, which has always
<PB N="3" REF="4">
made me rebel again&s;t that univer&s;ally-received Doctrine of condemning a Per&s;on's Actions without Exception, and by the Gro&s;s, becau&s;e &s;ome particular ones of his have not been exactly to our own Minds and Likeing; being yet, for any Thing I could ever &s;ee to the contrary, of Opinion the Man exi&s;ts not, who&s;e real Character is not a Compound of good and bad.</P>
<P>After having thus (as I flatter my&s;elf) fully proved my Qualifications for the Work I have taken in hand; to proceed in it, I &s;hall begin with the greate&s;t Charge, and what may be deem'd the Cau&s;e why every other laid to his <HI>R&mdash; H&mdash;</HI> has been aggravated. Sorry I am, that the Thing it&s;elf is too flagrant for me, or any Man in his Sen&s;es, to think of entirely reconciling the Publick to it; yet &s;till (with Submi&s;&s;ion to better Judgements) I can't help thinking it capable of being placed in &s;o mitigating a Light, that the Objectors them&s;elves would own, if it did not make again&s;t them, and I would not chu&s;e to be thought &s;o void of common Sen&s;e, as to expect that from any Man) that, con&s;idering his <HI>R&mdash; H&mdash;</HI>'s Youth and warm Blood, the Situation he was in is what might have hurried away any one, ever &s;o little influ|enced by <HI>Party-Spirit.</HI> Every <HI>Reader</HI> mu&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="5">
know that I am talking of the Victory gain'd over the Rebels at <HI>Culloden.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e it is allow'd on all Hands to have been the mo&s;t fatal Stroke that could have been given to the Glory, Riches, and Trade of the&s;e Kingdoms; and the &s;ettling the State and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Church</HI> upon &s;tronger, and more durable Foundations than they have ever yet re&s;ted upon. It would be too tedious to enumerate all the particular Advantages, which would have accrued to both, on a contrary Succe&s;s; but what will immedi|ately occur to every Body is the deter|mining the Rights of <HI>Electors</HI> to <HI>Parliament,</HI> and repealing the <HI>&s;eptennial Bill</HI>; and as for the <HI>Church</HI> &s;he could not fail of finding her Account in the great Di&s;couragement, which of cour&s;e would have been given to <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> of all Denominations.</P>
<P>It is an old Aphori&s;m, that to judge im|partially of the Merit or Demerit of any Action, one ought to put one's &s;elf in the Place and Circum&s;tances of the Per&s;on, at the Time of his performing it. In the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, this would be too dangerous for me to advi&s;e the <HI>Reader</HI> to, or &s;hew him the Example my&s;elf; but &s;o far we may follow his <HI>R&mdash; H&mdash;</HI> with Safety as to con&s;ider, what were in all Probability &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons that prompted him to do as he did.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">In the fir&s;t Place, if I may be allow'd to make u&s;e of an Argument from the Force of Blood, though I know it is at pre&s;ent gene|rally exploded, he might be actuated, for any Thing that appears to the contrary, by a Sen&s;e of Love and Duty to his M&mdash;y; in whom he had always found the be&s;t and tendere&s;t Father; two &s;uch Motives may no doubt have very violent Effects in young Minds, where they are unhappily left to operate to their full extent; but &s;hould they be allow'd to be brought as Arguments again&s;t his R&mdash; H&mdash;, I can't be &s;ure if afterwards they might not yet be apply 'd to the Di&s;turbance of &s;ome few Families, even of Di&s;tinction in <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; though no doubt at va&s;t Di&s;tances from <HI>Town,</HI> and of but &s;mall Fortunes; not to mention <HI>Ireland,</HI> of which I don't know enough to pretend to judge; but even &s;uppo&s;ing his R&mdash; H&mdash; the only In&s;tance left, in whom they were to be found at this pre&s;ent, I don't &s;ee whereon to build &s;o heinous a Charge again&s;t him, e&s;pecially when it comes to be con&s;ider'd, that by his high Rank he was actually debarr'd from all the Advantages in Education, which are to be drawn from foreign Travel, as it is now happily practiced, and the dome&s;tick Oc|currences in modern Life at <HI>White's,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. for as he never lo&s;t more than he
<PB N="6" REF="7">
could pay, he could have no Pretence for hating a Father for not allowing him more than he could afford.</P>
<P>Add we, that the Per&s;on, who&s;e Schemes and Hopes he &s;o entirely de&s;troy'd, may be &s;aid to have been ab&s;olutely unknown to his R&mdash; H&mdash;; one, who would never give him any Opportunity of &s;eeing his Face; one, who very po&s;&s;ibly may have been repre&s;ented to him in a very disadvan|tageous Light, and entirely unlike his real Character; I mean as we have it from the <HI>independent Electors.</HI> Every Body is liable to be impo&s;ed upon by Mi&s;repre&s;entation of Things; <HI>Princes</HI> more than other Men. It is the great Advantage of People in middling Stations, that <HI>Truth of Princes</HI> always flows down to us, pure and unadul|terated; whereas <HI>Truth to Princes</HI> by moun|ting upwards again&s;t it's natural Cour&s;e, and by the Force nece&s;&s;ary for gaining it a Pa&s;|&s;age, gets &s;omething from every Channel it goes through, before it arrives at them; &s;o that, though we may ab&s;olutely depend upon all we hear of them, they have no Manner of Rea&s;on to believe any Thing that comes to their Ears; the more Shame &s;ay I, for tho&s;e, who dare impo&s;e upon them. However, this Prejudice was not &s;o entirely peculiar to his R&mdash; H&mdash; but
<PB N="7" REF="8">
that many, otherwi&s;e, good Men, were &s;o blinded by the &s;ame Party-zeal, as to ven|ture their Lives and Fortunes along with him, in Oppo&s;ition to this Per&s;on, whom they had been taught to regard in &s;o odious a Light as verily to believe he could have no Chance of finding any Body di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to his Rule, but from the Convic|tion (we have indi&s;creetly let People be almo&s;t laugh'd out of) of his not being what he pretends to be.</P>
<P>Another Argument I have ventured to make u&s;e of, in Favour of his R&mdash; H&mdash;, I am &s;en&s;ible may be retorted upon me, for being too &s;elfi&s;h in him; but &s;ince we can none of us propo&s;e univer&s;ally to reform Mankind, it would be inhuman to refu&s;e our Com|mi&s;eration at lea&s;t to Weakne&s;&s;es that ap|pear to have their Foundation in Nature. It is this. He might perhaps be induced to the committing this Action by &s;ome Appre|hen&s;ions, which I cannot but &s;ay, and I hope I am not prejudiced in it, appear to me 'to have been ju&s;tly grounded (<HI>viz</HI>) that if he had not done as he did, he might have been reduced to the Condition of a pri|vate Man, or what we, though I verily be|lieve his R&mdash; H&mdash; does not, &s;hould think &s;till wor&s;e, to that of a dead one. Now, notwith&s;tanding all the Preten&s;ions to
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Virtue, which have been &s;o common, not to &s;ay cheap, latterly, I mu&s;t own I &s;till think ill enough of Mankind to be apt to believe there are others in the World, who, if they could be a&s;k'd, whether they would con&s;ent to have their Brains knock'd out, on Condi|tion the Duty on Salt or Candles &s;hould ex|pire punctually with them&s;elves, would be apt to boggle for &s;ome Time; therefore why it &s;hould have been expected of his R&mdash; H&mdash; to have laid down his Life quietly without making any Re&s;i&s;tance, for the Sake of Advantages, by the very Suppo&s;ition of which he is deprived of all Po&s;&s;ibility of partaking, I mu&s;t fairly declare I can &s;ee no manner of Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e an Author &s;hould all of a &s;ud|den grow de&s;perate, and take it into his Head to advance, that in the fatal Affair we are talk|ing of, his R&mdash; H&mdash; was not &s;o much in Fault as tho&s;e, who (according to the in|nate Ju&s;tice of Mankind) commit the great|e&s;t Mi&s;takes, and are them&s;elves the Occa&s;ion of the greate&s;t Errors, yet lay the Event of them at other People's Doors; might I not a&s;k them, when they complain of him &s;o bit|terly, for the compleat Mi&s;chief he brought upon them, and their whole De&s;ign, why in the Name of Wonder did not they pre|vent it? Would they have the A&s;&s;urance to
<PB N="9" REF="10">
an&s;wer, they could bring no more Men into the Field? Now I would be glad to &s;ee the Man &s;o ridiculous a Favourer of his R&mdash; H&mdash; as to dare advance that, if the Gen|tlemen in that Oppo&s;ition had brought fifty or &s;ixty thou&s;and Men more again&s;t him, he either could or would have attack'd them; unle&s;s, on the other Hand, his own Army had been a little re-inforced. Would not one &s;ometimes be apt to think that there are Peo|ple in the World, who &s;ee wrong Mea&s;ures taken, and things carry'd on in a Manner contrary to what they approve of, without endeavouring to hinder them, only that they may have the Plea&s;ure of roaring afterwards either again&s;t the Managers on their own Side, or tho&s;e who gain any Advantage on the other? Without &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition, it will be hard to account for the Behaviour of &s;uch of my Countrymen as lie under the Su&s;picion of not having dared to promote their favourite Cau&s;e, when it was in &s;o thriv|ing a Way; for we mu&s;t either conclude, that they &s;tood by, neutral Spectators, on purpo&s;e to open again&s;t his R&mdash; H&mdash;, if he &s;hould be Victor; or that they, who are call'd by a Name odious to the pre&s;ent Go|vernment, are only &s;uch till they have an Opportunity of being &s;o to any Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">When I have gone thus far, to convince the Reader I am not animated with the Spirit of an Editor, who, whatever Author he is at Work upon, is determined to &s;ee no Ble|mi&s;h, either in his per&s;onal Character or Writings; I will of my own Accord give up the Point, the <HI>Sc&mdash;ts</HI> &s;o ju&s;tly complain of, as ab&s;olutely indefen&s;ible, his permitting, perhaps it might be proved commanding, (at lea&s;t his Officers did) his Troops to fire &s;harp Shot, in&s;tead of only Powder upon the Rebels. What will become of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberty, if People are to be knock'd on the Head for following their lawful Employ|ments? and what Cruelty can equal his R&mdash; H&mdash;, in not con&s;idering there was not a Family engaged again&s;t him, which had not generou&s;ly furni&s;h'd the Army under his Command with Father, Brother, or neare&s;t Relation?</P>
<P>It would be look'd upon as an Affectation in me, an Omi&s;&s;ion by De&s;ign, &s;hould I take leave of this Subject, without taking Notice of one particular Branch of this Charge, though even at the wor&s;t I think it a very trifling one; namely, that during the whole Northern Expedition, his R&mdash; H&mdash;'s Table was never cover'd without Highlander's Har&s;elets, dre&s;s'd in &s;ome Shape or other. Now, though enough
<PB N="11" REF="12">
might be &s;aid in Alleviation of this, (were it proved inconte&s;tably true) from the im|moderate Pa&s;&s;ion for new Di&s;hes of all &s;orts, that has &s;pread &s;o univer&s;ally among&s;t us of late; yet, I &s;hall wave it for the pre&s;ent, as I will make no Scruple of owning my&s;elf &s;o far inclined to favour his R&mdash; H&mdash;, where there can be any vi&s;ible Pretence for &s;o doing, as to &s;u&s;pend my Belief of this Article, till I can light upon any one of the Cooks, who will give in upon Oath, before any of his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tices of the Peace, that he him&s;elf, or &s;ome Brother of the Profe&s;&s;ion to his Knowledge, actually dre&s;s'd the &s;aid, Di&s;h, and deliver'd it over to proper Per&s;ons, in order to be &s;erved up. What I think makes con&s;iderably in Favour of my Doubt is, that it is well known his R&mdash; H&mdash;, &s;o far from being in any wi&s;e nice in his Diet, while he was upon that Expedition, always contented him&s;elf with whatever could be got for him, with the lea&s;t Trouble; &s;o far at lea&s;t cannot be di&s;puted, that they could not be literally a con&s;tant Di&s;h, as they all along were the Game in the World the &s;hye&s;t of its Pur&s;uer.</P>
<P>I have been told, and have heard it af|firm'd more than once, by one of undoubted Credit, that there actually did exi&s;t in Print,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
and not a great while ago, a certain uni|ver&s;ity Performance, which, had it never been publi&s;h'd, would have been call'd a famous Oration, but that the &s;uppo&s;ed Charge in that Speech, which was only &s;uppo&s;ed, was too inexplicite; that it was difficult to &s;ay where the Encomium on the beaten <HI>Italian Roman-catholick</HI> ended, and the Satire on the victorious <HI>Engli&s;h Prote&s;|tant</HI> began, both from the Authors para|doxical Manner, and from a certain Ob&s;cu|rity in his Stile, which was imagined to ari&s;e from his blinking the Law; and more|over I was told that either he, or his Readers, did not under&s;tand Latin; but as this Piece is at pre&s;ent no where to be found, I reckon I am excu&s;ed from taking farther Notice of it. It would be pity to di&s;turb the A&s;hes of an Invective, which is now at Peace in a &s;eparate State; and which, from all I can learn of it, was in that its Day very inno|cent; though, perhaps, that might be owing to its being very unintelligible.</P>
<P>There is to my own Knowledge, another Satiri&s;t, (as he thinks him&s;elf) in every Re&s;pect preferable to the former, of whom it might be proper to take &s;ome Notice, if the Poignancy of his Reproofs did not lie chiefly in Da&s;hes; but as it is not half &s;o ea&s;y to write an Apology, or an Attempt
<PB N="13" REF="14">
towards one, all in A&s;terics, as a Philippic, I am afraid I mu&s;t leave him unmole&s;ted, to avail him&s;elf of all his Influence over the Marrowbones and Cleavers of <HI>Clare-market,</HI> and yet they (however it happen'd I can't tell though I am certain of the Fact) rang on both Sides la&s;t <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Election.</P>
<P>Let us proceed now to his R&mdash; H&mdash;'s Conduct in <HI>Flanders,</HI> of which it is very difficult for us to pick up any exact and authentic Information, as it mu&s;t have been remitted to us, either by his Friends, or our Enemies. The fir&s;t, I dare not pro|duce as Witne&s;&s;es to be rely'd on in this Ca&s;e, and I think we &s;hould be in the wrong to believe our Enemies; they indeed &s;ay more in Prai&s;e both of his Conduct and Courage than the former. In this Dilemma, it may be &s;afe&s;t to &s;tick to the true <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Way of thinking; which is, that the Soldier, who comes off alive, has done nothing for us; and that he, who dies, has been paid by us before-hand for &s;o doing. But let this be how it will, the Impartiality I profe&s;s, ob|liges me to declare, I have not one Word to &s;ay in Excu&s;e for his R&mdash; H&mdash;'s unac|countable Over-&s;ight, in having reckon'd upon our faithful Allies, any otherwi&s;e than one ought to reckon upon our faithful Friends in private Life. Be&s;ides (taking Succe&s;s for the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
only approved Te&s;t of every De&s;ign) &s;ome Blame will &s;till hang upon his R&mdash; H&mdash; for any Di&s;advantage we &s;uffer'd from the Enemy; &s;ince there &s;till remain'd under his Command (de&s;erted as he was by our Allies) a little Army, almo&s;t incapable of fearing Numbers, while it follow'd him: nay, if the Truth was known, it might appear he had a con&s;iderable Superiority over the E|nemy, at &s;o moderate a Computation as <HI>one Engli&s;hman</HI> again&s;t <HI>ten French,</HI> which has always been reckon'd an advantageous Bett on our Side. Another Thing, I de&s;pair of ever being able to palliate, is his endea|vouring to reduce the Army under military Di&s;cipline; and I &s;hould have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for that De&s;pair, if it were from this only Circum&s;tance attending it; its being copied from the <HI>French,</HI> which alone is enough to render it odious to every free|born <HI>Briton</HI>; all that can be &s;aid for it is, it &s;eems to have been undertaken from a Want of examining into the Difference there is between our Government and theirs; the Officers in that Service, as they have no P&mdash;t for them&s;elves, or neare&s;t Rela|tions, to have Seats in, actually have Nothing better to do, than apply them&s;elves to the Study of the Science they profe&s;s. I have heard from a Friend of mine, who has been abroad, and a good deal conver&s;ant with them, that
<PB N="15" REF="16">
when he fir&s;t arrived among&s;t them, he has more than once been ready to blu&s;h, and that, for Per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;h'd Birth, and &s;ome Rank in the Army, at hearing them talk as minutely and intelligibly of all man|ner of military Operations, as if their Cha|racters or Bread depended upon it; to a Degree, that a common Engineer of ours (&s;ays he) would be a&s;hamed to think him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected of knowing &s;o much. I dare not urge too far, as a palliative Argument, the Propen&s;ity we have, one and all, always to abu&s;e, and con&s;tantly to copy from that Nation; but this is certain, that the pre&s;ent unfortunate Charge again&s;t his R&mdash; H&mdash;, and a Politene&s;s, which, though of his natural Growth, is &s;o different from our Manners as to pa&s;s for foreign, are the only Fa&s;hions I have ever heard him condemn'd for learning from our Neigh|bours. As I make no Secret of my being a good deal di&s;tre&s;s'd for a proper Defence, in this immediate Subject, I tru&s;t the Reader will have the Goodne&s;s, in Return, to forgive, if I am forced to go a great Way for proper Matter upon the Occa&s;ion. Perhaps then he might be dazzled with that tin&s;ell Ob|&s;ervation of the Submi&s;&s;ion the <HI>French</HI> enure them&s;elves to at Home, being what will, one Day or other, render them the Lords of every Body el&s;e; but this Doctrine is,
<PB N="16" REF="17">
and always mu&s;t be ab&s;urd, if apply'd to &s;o <HI>brave</HI> and <HI>generous a Nation as we are,</HI> who are above concerning our&s;elves to what Country we become a Province, or how &s;oon; provided always, till then, we can keep our&s;elves clear of any Subordination at Home. I know it has been urged &s;till far|ther again&s;t his R&mdash; H&mdash;, that he not only endeavour'd to recover military Di&s;cipline, but was authorized to do &s;o by Law; and it is hard to &s;eparate the Ideas of it, and Inju&s;tice; but happily for us he &s;eems not to have known how many illegal Things he might legally do, el&s;e it would have been no Amends to the Sufferers to have &s;aid, in Excu&s;e of Tyranny, that it did not ri&s;e to the Level of the Law; &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e a Country, where the Law it&s;elf may be more in&s;ufferable than any Abu&s;e of it could be. In An&s;wer to this Charge I have no more to &s;ay, than though, in a political Sen&s;e, to be able to do Hurt is, and ought to be, an actual Crime, yet in a legal one, to have even attempted it, if it fail of Succe&s;s, is &s;o far from being one, that it is ab&s;olutely unpuni&s;hable.</P>
<P>It is farther charged upon his R&mdash; H&mdash;, that he not only honours with his Company and Conver&s;ation, but has now and then advanced in the Army &s;ome, who,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
though of our mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd Families, are only of about the &s;ame Years with him|&s;elf. It has been &s;aid in Excu&s;e of this, by &s;ome, (who I &s;uppo&s;e had their Rea&s;ons for it) that very few of our Veterans had &s;een more Service, and that there might be in that Number tho&s;e, who had forgot even what they had &s;een; but far be it from me to give into any Rea&s;on that may yield the lea&s;t Encouragement to the Forwardne&s;s of the Youth of this Age, at all Times too much prejudiced in Favour of it&s;elf, but now in&s;olent enough to conceive it&s;elf as capable to learn, and as active to execute, as we, of advanced Years, know our&s;elves to be. But if there is any Thing favourable to be &s;aid, in Extenuation of this Charge upon his R&mdash; H&mdash;, it is, that though he is &s;o great a Prince, it is po&s;&s;ible he may have &s;ome of the Failings of human Nature in him; among&s;t which, when one is merciful|ly inclined, one may have the Goodne&s;s to rank the Choice of Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Time, and Turn of Life with one&s;elf.</P>
<P>Having thus far endeavour'd to vindicate, in a friendly Manner, (if the Expre&s;&s;ion does not &s;ound too familiar, though it means no more than giving up the main Points of an Accu&s;ation) &s;o much of his R&mdash; H&mdash;'s Behaviour as is at all relative to his
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Command, let us follow him into the Coun|try. I cannot but &s;ay, I am &s;urprized his pa&s;&s;ionate Love of his Park and Retirement &s;hould fill &s;o many well-meaning People with Alarms for the publick Repo&s;e, which they conceive to be in the utmo&s;t Danger thereby. This is being &s;o afraid of not &s;leeping, as to keep one&s;elf awake by that very Fear. So far we will allow to be true, his R&mdash; H&mdash; is there at the Head of a great Body of Hunt&s;men, not to mention Whippers-in, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> who as they &s;ometimes &s;ee, and perhaps may, &s;ome of them, have had the Honour to have been &s;poke to by him, I make no manner of Doubt, would be ready to a Man to &s;acrifice their Lives in his Ser|vice. But my Amaze &s;till continues that this &s;hould be thought a ju&s;tifiable Pretence for People of quick-&s;ighted Fears, to put them&s;elves and the Publick in Terrors, as if <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>-Ca&s;tle was not therefore &s;afe. Had his R&mdash; H&mdash; had any &s;uch De&s;ign, what could have prevented his trying to put it in Execution, when he had &s;o fine an Op|portunity, by having Cannon ready planted in his Park for a Trial, and that at a Time when it is very well known that Fortre&s;s was but very indifferently garri&s;on'd? But if the Grounds of Su&s;picion were ever &s;o ju&s;t and clear, ought we not to re&s;t quite &s;ecure on that Side, &s;o long as we have the Satisfaction
<PB N="19" REF="20">
to know that important Place is in the Hands of one, who can never in the lea&s;t be &s;u&s;pected of any Kind of Inclination to give up any Thing to his R&mdash; H&mdash;. As to that fooli&s;h Story of one belonging to his Suite be|ing &s;hot upon the Spot for reconnoitring too curiou&s;ly &s;ome of the Outworks; I can take upon my&s;elf to a&s;&s;ure the Reader, that the Thing happen'd long before any of the&s;e Su&s;picions had been broach'd, and was in re|ality nothing more than a Dog of his R&mdash; H&mdash;, who &s;uffer'd Death for marauding.</P>
<P>The la&s;t mention'd Circum&s;tance is far from being the only one that has made me often and &s;eriou&s;ly wi&s;h, he had been plea&s;ed to content him&s;elf without having either Hare or Partridge at his Table, or in|deed any Thing the Product of his own Park. A Gentleman, who lives in his Neighbour|hood, has zealou&s;ly endeavour'd to give my Wi&s;h it's Effect, by putting it, as far as in him lay, out of his R&mdash; H&mdash;'s Power to do otherwi&s;e, having mo&s;t generou&s;ly af|forded half a Crown for every Partridge Ne&s;t that could be brought him in the Sea&s;on. What adds to the Magnificence of this Ex|pence is, that it is not done with a View of making a Merit of it, but (I &s;uppo&s;e) as a Return of Gratitude for family Obligations; which is having a Memory almo&s;t unparal|lel'd
<PB N="20" REF="21">
in this forgetful Age; wherein I have lived to remark, though I yet make U&s;e nei|ther of Crutches nor Spectacles, more In|&s;tances than one of extraordinary Acts of Friend&s;hip, Kindne&s;s and Obligation, placed upon tho&s;e who have &s;o &s;oon, and &s;o entire|ly wore out all Traces of them as &s;carce to have thought of, and never to have put in Practice, the lea&s;t Mi&s;chief in Return to their Benefactors. I have been told &s;ome leading People in the City are quite in my Way of thinking as to this Article, nay carry it farther, as appears by the Hints they give out, how popular an Act it would be in his R&mdash; H&mdash;, &s;hould he think pro|per to live, if it was but for one Month, him&s;elf and his Family, entirely upon our own Herrings. For my own Part, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine, if &s;uch an Exce&s;s of Popularity might not, in the E|vent, do more Harm than Good; a Doubt which in all Probability could never have enter'd my Head, had I any Herrings to &s;ell; but as to my Wi&s;h, I believe &s;carce any one will differ from me in it; I mean of tho&s;e, who by living within any rea&s;onable Di&s;tance of his R&mdash; H&mdash;, have accu&s;tom'd them|&s;elves to look upon his Game as their own. However, though the Advice I would have given is what I have no Manner of Rea&s;on to imagine would have been follow'd, I am
<PB N="21" REF="22">
far from being one of tho&s;e who cry out upon a Practice contrary to it, as being &s;o heinous a Crime in his R&mdash; H&mdash;; and I flatter my&s;elf that as to this one Point at lea&s;t, I &s;hall have the good Luck to find more than one Reader of the &s;ame extenuating Di&s;po&s;ition with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Every Body mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of what in|finite Prejudice &s;o exalted a Station as that of his R&mdash; H&mdash; mu&s;t have been to him, in &s;o free a Country as this; where nothing but an immen&s;e Fortune can &s;creen a Man from the Odium of being a Gentle|man; a Rank, which like the Po&s;ts in our Streets, every Link-boy thinks is placed for him to play at Leap-frog over. But with what Ju&s;tice, the Rancour of a certain Set of People, not &s;atisfied with heaping up all that the mo&s;t &s;evere Ob&s;ervation can furni&s;h them with again&s;t their Day of Wrath, &s;till adds to the Load, to be thrown on the Object of it, Circum&s;tances, impo&s;&s;ible to have been avoided, I appeal to the impartial. Thank God, his R&mdash; H&mdash;, who is undoubtedly a Gentleman, has not his For|tune to make; &s;o that he has nothing to fear from the Clog, that Appellation has always been to Preferment, at lea&s;t is at pre&s;ent in the&s;e Kingdoms. But his R&mdash; H&mdash;'s Birth is what, I imagine, could never have
<PB N="22" REF="23">
been made u&s;e of as an Argument again&s;t him, if it had not been thought a nece&s;&s;ary Introduction for the Charge of Pride, which was to follow it. No doubt his R &mdash; H &mdash; might have eluded it if he had been plea&s;ed to merry-make with his Neigh|bours, as other country Gentlemen do, who, I take for granted, would have made him welcome to their be&s;t; and I don't doubt but <HI>a many</HI> of us would have taken a Ride from Town, and have been jolly at the Lodge, <HI>with all our Hearts.</HI> But whether the Privilege may not extend upwards as well as downwards, of living in the Country in what Manner one will, is a Point that may bear di&s;puting upon. However, to rea&s;on a little upon the Ca&s;e; I don't know a Vice, and &s;carce a Virtue, that Mankind is &s;o much obliged to, as this &s;ame Pride; for take it in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e, it is no more than a Valuation of Merit and Rank, which can't be &s;ettled between the Publick and every Particular; for if both Parties agree upon the Sum total; it is no longer Pride; for which Rea&s;on I have often wonder'd to find it &s;o common a Reproach, from the trading Part of this City, as it is only an Endeavour to get a greater Price for a Commodity than it is really worth; but then to take it in its be&s;t Sen&s;e, how u&s;eful a Monitor is it to the
<PB N="23" REF="24">
World, by its never failing to &s;tick in&s;epa|rably to every thing low, dirty and mean, that has got over our Heads, never to forget the Na&s;tine&s;s of its Origin! If any Thing therefore, his R&mdash; H&mdash; is to be pitied, for being born in a Rank &s;o much above Pride, as to have it ab&s;olutely out of his Power to be proud if he would, and for having no one Pretence to it, that can be di&s;puted by any Man living. But could he be guilty of it, not he would be to be blamed, but our Con&s;titution, which has the unac|countable Defedt to have neglected the bind|ing out the neare&s;t in Blood to the Imperial Crown of the&s;e Realms to the mo&s;t eminent Trade&s;men in the City; which, I take it, is the only Method to be thought of for con|vincing this great Metropolis that Trade is &s;ufficiently the Concern of the Crown.</P>
<P>The next Objection is point blank con|trary to the la&s;t, but bears &s;o hard upon his R&mdash; H&mdash;, that could I look upon it as undoubtedly true, I &s;hould reckon I threw away all Preten&s;ions of ever hereafter pa&s;&s;ing my&s;elf upon the World for a di&s;in|tere&s;ted Writer, &s;hould I &s;o much as offer to palliate it. But is it not too gro&s;s to Sen&s;e to be conceived, that his R&mdash; H&mdash; forgetting every Advantage over the more amiable Part of his Fellow-Subjects, which could be
<PB N="24" REF="25">
drawn from Birth, Youth, Per&s;on and Va|lour, (the mo&s;t dangerous Qualifications, were our fair Countrywomen of an Acce&s;s &s;till more difficult than the Strictne&s;s of our pre&s;ent Religion and Morals have rather too &s;everely ty'd them up to) &s;hould &s;o far have neglected Beauty of our own Product and Manufacture, as to have taken Notice of a <HI>Piedmonte&s;e</HI> Girl; he, who &s;uitably to his high Rank, might, and ought to have amu&s;ed him&s;elf with bringing Unhappine&s;s and Infamy into at lea&s;t a dozen Families? I &s;hall tack to this Article, becau&s;e it has no kind of Connection with it, the greivous Accu&s;ation again&s;t his R&mdash; H&mdash; for being inclined to grow fat, but as I have been very well a&s;&s;ured he does not encourage it, either by too much Sleep, or too little Exerci&s;e, and that con&s;equently it cannot be fix'd upon him as his own Choice, and be&s;ides that, his Country has never yet had any Cau&s;e to complain of any Inactivity in him, when &s;he &s;tood in Need of him, I am of humble Opinion, it ought to be treated with that Favour and Indulgence, which Crimes, &s;pringing from Con&s;titution, in every Body el&s;e, never fail receiving from the Publick.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavour'd to remove, or at lea&s;t to alleviate, every Thing I have yet heard laid to his R&mdash; H&mdash;'s Charge,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
with the lea&s;t Appearance of Probability, and I have little Doubt but all tho&s;e, who will allow them&s;elves Time &s;eriou&s;ly to re|flect, how prone we all are to pull down to our own Level whatever over-tops us, either by Merit or Birth, will agree with me in be|lieving, that one is likely to have heard rather more than le&s;s than the Truth. I have no Doubt neither, but the Publick will do me the Ju&s;tice to own, that if, on the one Hand, I have not over familiarly treated a Name &s;o re&s;pectable, on the other, I have kept my&s;elf free from a Degree of Flattery, which is now o'Days grown to be look'd upon, not only as the &s;ole Dialect in which Men of &s;uch exalted Rank are to be addre&s;s'd, but to be &s;poken of. If I have &s;o much Succe&s;s, as to have wiped off any one of tho&s;e Strokes of Aggravation, which have been added to his Picture, but were in Reality no Part of it, I &s;hall have an&s;wer'd the only View I had, namely, the doing Ju&s;tice to one, whom I own I cannot help wi&s;hing well to, becau&s;e I wi&s;h well to my&s;elf.</P>
