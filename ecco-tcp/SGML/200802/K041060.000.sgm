<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT I have been a Friend to Mr. TAYLOR, <HI>jun.</HI> I am very ready to own, and wi&s;h my Friend&s;hip could have been of more Service than I fear it has been, becau&s;e I think he de&s;erves it; and I &s;hall be glad to give him all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance in my Power for the Future.</P>
<P>I CAN atte&s;t the Truth not only of his hav|ing performed a very remarkable Cure on one of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Ancaster</HI>'s Family; but that he al&s;o had the Honour of being twice &s;ent for, from Town, by the Duke him|&s;elf, to his Grace's Seat at <HI>Grimesthorpe,</HI> in <HI>Lin|coln&s;hire,</HI>; where he attended his Grace under a violent Inflammation in his Eyes; which Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI> treated with all due Care and Judg|ment, 'till he effected a complete Recovery.</P>
<P>THE principal Ob&s;ervation I made upon the <HI>Ightham Boy,</HI> was, his confirming the <HI>Phoe|nomenon</HI> in Vi&s;ion, of Objects being painted, inverted upon the <HI>Retina</HI>; for when a Pin was held upright before him, he con&s;tantly directed his Finger to the Head, in&s;tead of the Point,
<PB N="v" REF="6">
and &s;o, <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;</HI>: How the Mind turns it afterwards, is a Que&s;tion of another Kind, and very hard to be re&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>I have been a Witne&s;s to &s;everal other very deplorable Ca&s;es, in which, he has given &s;ur|prizing Relief; and if it were proper, I could name &s;ome other Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Rank and Quality, to whom he has given the fulle&s;t Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I have but one Thing more to add; which is, That my worthy Friend Mr. <HI>Chi&s;elden,</HI> in his Life-time, gave this Man all the Encour|agement in his Power; and for this good Rea&s;on; becau&s;e as he told me, he very well de&s;erv'd it; which I think too, or el&s;e I had &s;av'd you, and my&s;elf the Trouble of this An&s;wer.</P>

<P><HI>AS</HI> great Weights may hang upon &s;mall Lines, we know not to what exten&s;ive Benefit, the within propo&s;ed Foundation of an <HI>HOSPITAL for the BLIND,</HI> may arrive; &s;ince the Con&s;titution of &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary and de&s;irable Charity, has already been &s;o ge|nerou&s;ly patroniz'd by his Grace the Duke of <HI>AN|CASTER,</HI> and the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>GODOLPHIN,</HI> be&s;ides other noble and publick-&s;pirited Per&s;ons of Rank and Di&s;tinction, who have al&s;o &s;ig|nified their favourable Di&s;po&s;ition, as well to establi&s;h and maintain the &s;ame, as to appropriate &s;ome rea|&s;onable Salary for the Encouragement of his De&s;erts, who fir&s;t offer'd this laudable Scheme thereof, and his Attendance upon the Patients to be admitted therein.</P>
<P>Indeed, Merit is a Plant, not always of &s;uch a hardy and independant Nature, as will ri&s;e to any eminent Head of its own Strength, and &s;pread it&s;elf forth, or flouri&s;h to the Notice, and fructify to the Advantage of Mankind, without &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance: On the contrary, we &s;ee Virtue often like the Vine, apt to

droop with the Weight of its own vigorous Fertility, and even to trail, or creep only along the Ground, till it withers and con&s;umes away, or is trampled on, and cru&s;h'd under Foot, without &s;ome friendly and foster|ing Hand to rear, conduct, and di&s;play it, to the cheri&s;hing Beams of the Sun: Then will it produce its Fruits to Maturity in Abundance, and adorn its Supporters with many a generous Clu&s;ter.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, it is with the greate&s;t Satisfaction that I perceive, in your courteous An|&s;wer to my Letter annex'd, how cordially you have, by your benevolent Recommendations, promoted the Practice and Intere&s;t of Mr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> who fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed the Foundation of the Ho&s;pital afore&s;aid, and among the many other Distempers of the Eyes by him relieved, perform'd the remarkable Cure that is the Subject of the following Di&s;cour&s;e, which I beg leave to offer the Publick, under the Shelter and Protection of your Name. Had you been in Town, I would have per&s;onally intreated the Favour of this Liberty, as a further Proof of your Friend&s;hip, to the Performer of that Cure, and of its great Influence, if it &s;hould extenuate the Imperfections in this Repre&s;entation of it. But as the Impre&s;&s;ion is &s;o nearly fini&s;h'd, I hope you will pardon the Pre&s;umption of this Addre&s;s, as al&s;o that of publi&s;hing my Letter to you, with your An&s;wer; &s;ince others may be confirmed thereby, in the Contents of it, no le&s;s than,</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS On the CURE of <HI>William Taylor,</HI> THE BLIND BOY Of IGHTHAM.</HEAD>
<P>_SINCE our merciful Creator has conde&s;cended to render him&s;elf more vi&s;ible in his <HI>Operations,</HI> than his <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> what an invaluable Ble&s;&s;ing ought we to e&s;teem it, that he has a&s;&s;i&s;ted our <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> with &s;uch an ad|mirable Sen&s;e, as that of <HI>Sight,</HI> thro' &s;uch curious

Organs as the Eyes!

<P>AND as it is a Satisfaction unexpre&s;&s;ible, in Minds divinely exalted, to enjoy tho&s;e ocular Confirmations, what mi&s;erable Darkne&s;s mu&s;t it be, to be deprived of them? But to what Strait, what narrow Limits mu&s;t their Knowledge and Ideas be contracted, who have been led about, in this State of Ob&s;curity, from the Time of their Birth, for the whole Night of their Lives? What a comfortle&s;s Condition, to think, that all Places and Things, are to them alike di&s;|mal, and the whole Univer&s;e it&s;elf but a Dun|geon! But on the other hand, to con&s;ider, what a Fea&s;t of Felicities mu&s;t be &s;pread before them, in having &s;uch Lo&s;s repair'd; &s;uch Want &s;up|ply'd, and that ine&s;timable Benefit of Sight, from which the Eyes of the Blind, had been, by natural Defects, Di&s;ea&s;es, or Accidents, &s;o long debarr'd, &s;uddenly, by the &s;kilful Hand of their Fellow-Creature, be&s;tow'd upon them! When he draws the Curtain of Darkne&s;s from before them, and opens at once, as it were a new Cre|ation of Images and Objects, in moving and &s;till Life; at once, a mo&s;t &s;pacious and opulent Pro&s;pect, of all Varieties, on every Side, in this

lower World, and innumerable Worlds them|&s;elves, glittering in the va&s;t Expance above! For all which &s;erviceable, delightful, glorious and marvellous Scenes, to be made Partaker, what Reward, what Recompence can be ade|quate? And yet of &s;o much Happine&s;s, how long will &s;ome remain unpo&s;&s;e&s;s'd? becau&s;e their penurious and enthralled Souls cannot give them Liberty to make any rea&s;onable Return of Gratitude, but will rather con&s;train them to continue moping on, in perpetual Pain or Dark|ne&s;s, than let them be&s;tow any thing for the Enjoyment of their Sight. Some again are de|terr'd from &s;eeking any Redre&s;s, thro' a Pre|judice rai&s;ed by Ignorance again&s;t it, under the di&s;ta&s;teful Notion of trying Practices, and <HI>dab|bling</HI> or <HI>tampering</HI> with their Eyes: So thro' their diffident, ob&s;tinate, or indolent Delay, in ad|mitting timely and proper Applications to di&s;|per&s;e, or a&s;&s;wage their Di&s;order, at the Be|ginning of its fir&s;t and un&s;ettled Inva&s;ion, or Encroachment upon them, &s;ubmit to, as what could not be prevented, the daily Depravation of their Sight; or perhaps at la&s;t, permit them|&s;elves to be quite blinded, even by tho&s;e very ignorant People, who di&s;&s;uaded them from at|tempting to be re&s;tor'd, by &s;uch as have the greate&s;t Skill, and are be&s;t qualified to relieve them. And la&s;tly, how long will others refrain from applying for &s;uch Relief, thro' the fear of &s;ome little &s;hort, or &s;udden Smart, which the di&s;|ea&s;ed Organ may endure in the Recovery; &s;o let
<PB N="4" REF="12">
their Maladies grow &s;tronger and more &s;tub|born, as the Organ it&s;elf, its Spirits, Humours, or Mu&s;cles grow weaker, and more decayed or corrupted, till by Inflamations, and other dangerous Con&s;equencies, they become incure|able; when the lighte&s;t Bru&s;hing over the Eye, with the Corner of an Handkerchief, a little Du&s;t, a Pinch of Snuff blown into it, or the bare wa&s;hing it with any &s;trong Liquor, no le&s;s than the more violent Wounds, Blows, and Di&s;tempers, which <HI>blind</HI> it, &s;hall often be more painful than the Operations by which the gentle and careful Hand of an experienc'd Oculi&s;t re|&s;tores it to <HI>Sight.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we read among the many Volumes which have been written upon the Eyes, that there are above <HI>Two hundred and forty Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> with their Complications, to which they, and their relative Parts are incident, we cannot but perceive, there are room and Bu&s;ine&s;s enough, for &s;everal ingenious Men to make this beauti|ful Orb, minute as it is, with the Pre&s;ervation, or Re&s;toration of its mo&s;t precious Sen&s;e, their &s;ole Study and Practice: And as it may be Employment enough, to devote their whole Time to it, &s;o there ought to be Encouragement enough in the&s;e, as in <HI>France</HI> and other Coun|tries, to engage them a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly in the Attain|ment of a &s;ucce&s;sful Proficiency therein. If many, from the meane&s;t Excre&s;cences, by keep|ing our Hair, our Corns, and Nails in due and convenient Retrenchment, have e&s;tabli&s;h'd very
<PB N="5" REF="13">
comfortable Ocupations, and cut them&s;elves out very decent Livelyhoods, independent of <HI>Phy&s;ic, Surgery, Anatomy,</HI> or <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> for the Ea&s;e chiefly of our Feet; how much more de&s;erve they, who, be&s;ides the Merit of being acquaint|ed with the nobler, more con&s;iderable and im|portant Objects of their Practice, can by the Knowledge and Aid al&s;o of tho&s;e Sciences, join'd with their own Experience, pre&s;erve or recover our <HI>Sight,</HI> by which tho&s;e very Feet are guided, and we are a&s;&s;i&s;ted to exerci&s;e them? If many Ho&s;pitals and Infirmaries have been charitably erected, and endow'd, for the <HI>Lame,</HI> why none for the <HI>Blind?</HI> Since the Blind may be as well Lame as they, uncapable as they are, of u&s;ing their Arms or Legs to any Effect; or as unable to walk without a Leader, as a Cripple without a Crutch; and &s;ince, the Cure of the Blind re|quires longer Experience, deeper Penetration into the Nature of its Object, and more deli|cate Operations than the Lame.</P>
<P>IT is le&s;s difficult to attain a &s;uperficial Know|ledge of the Di&s;orders that affect the Body of Man in general, than a profound Knowledge of tho&s;e which di&s;tre&s;s &s;ome Parts in particular, whereof the Eye is the Chief; complicated as it is, of &s;uch fine &s;olid, as well as &s;ubtil and &s;pi|ritous Matter; con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch various Com|po&s;itions, &s;uch different Sub&s;tances, Teguments, Films, Fluids, Mu&s;cles, Nerves, Veins, and Fibres; &s;uch an elementary Labyrinth of con|cordant Parts, mutually reflecting all Images to

<P>As there was no Pro&s;pect of procuring this Boy any Relief that might re&s;tore him to his Sight, in the Country, where he lived, he was recommended to the Care of the &s;aid Mr. <HI>John Taylor,</HI> the Younger, at <HI>London</HI>; who &s;oon found him &s;o lively and active, that he would not &s;uffer his Eyes to be even examined, without much &s;truggling: But after &s;ome &s;erious and affect|ing Expo&s;tulations with him; after the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;urances given him, that if he did not patient|ly comply with the only Means that were to be u&s;ed for his Cure, he would be deprived of all Ways to get his Livelihood; mu&s;t be a Beggar|boy, in want of Cloaths and Victuals, and be led about, to &s;eek his Bread, from Door to Door, like &s;uch a one, of whom he had heard, and have nothing to depend upon, but the cold, &s;canty, and precarious Relief of an hard-hearted World; he thereupon con&s;ented to undergo any Trial that &s;hould be made upon him, at his Father's Hou&s;e in the Country. Accordingly the Oculi&s;t went thither; but being apprehen|&s;ive that his Patient would not lie &s;o &s;till on the Table, as &s;uch a tender and &s;teady Operation of his Hand required, he told him that he mu&s;t be tied fa&s;t down, from &s;tirring or winching: But he, as he could &s;ee no Danger, felt no Fear; therefore ab&s;olutely promis'd, he would, without any Con&s;traint, lie unmov'd; which he did, with his Hands in his Pockets, till the Ob|&s;truction

in his right Eye, was, in little more than a Minute, entirely remov'd, without the lea&s;t &s;tarting or Complaint. As &s;oon as the in|&s;ide of his Eye was clear'd of its little thick, white, cloudy Spot, by that delicate Depre&s;&s;ion of it, with the Needle, which is called <HI>Couching,</HI> &s;o that it quite &s;ub&s;ided, and did no longer in|tercept the Light, or Admi&s;&s;ion of Objects to the Organs of Vi&s;ion, he, being a&s;k'd by &s;ome of the Company, for there were &s;ixteen of his Neighbours pre&s;ent. <HI>What he &s;aw?</HI> An&s;wer'd, with a Kind of wild Tran&s;port, and Wonder, at the &s;trange Shapes, Forms, and Colours of many Things, &s;o incomprehen&s;ible about him, that <HI>He beheld the Room full of Lights, and Moons.</HI> For, as I under&s;tand, his Eyes were not &s;o totally dark'ned by the <HI>Cataracts,</HI> but that he had &s;ome faint Di&s;cernment, or glimmering Sen&s;ation of luminous Bodies, admitted round the Pupil; as in the mo&s;t ordinary Eclip&s;es of the Sun, the Moon's Di&s;k does not &s;o entirely over-&s;hadow and ob&s;cure it, but that &s;ome Edgings of its Light will irradiate, or break out at its Sides, or Circumference; the like of which, might help the Boy to de&s;cribe &s;ome &s;hining Uten&s;ils he now &s;aw, by tho&s;e Names: For next Time, upon the Dre&s;&s;ing of his Eye, he declared, as it is atte&s;ted in a Letter of his Father's, <HI>That he &s;aw the Pewter on the Shelf, with the Clock, and its Ca&s;e; that all the&s;e Things the Boy knew before by Feeling,</HI> and, <HI>I dare &s;ay,</HI> adds he, <HI>that now he can &s;ee the above-mention'd Things.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21">THESE are his Father's Words; and they have been con&s;trued to &s;ignify, that the Boy di&s;tinctly named tho&s;e &s;everal Pieces of Furniture, upon his fir&s;t beholding them, from the Knowledge he before had by Feeling them, without having felt them again, after the U&s;e of his Sight. But &s;uch a familiar Acquaintance in&s;tantly with Ob|jects never before &s;een, how frequently &s;o ever before felt, has been much di&s;puted by &s;ome <HI>Oculi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Opticians,</HI> who have deeply con&s;idered the Properties and Powers of Sight, &s;o long kept an utter Stranger to tho&s;e Objects. In|deed the Clock might be di&s;coverable to him, by the Help of his Hearing; as from the Vi|brations of its Pendulum, &s;triking, and other Sounds; but the Di&s;hes, Plates, Shelves, and other Things, tho' perhaps often handled, could as it is thought, &s;carcely be named, upon the fir&s;t Sight only of them; at lea&s;t, without Feeling again, and a better Knowledge of tho&s;e Parts and Places in the Room, where he might before feel them, than he could receive in his State of Blindne&s;s, or retain, and refer to, at fir&s;t Sight.</P>

<P>IT may be con&s;ider'd, whether this Opinion upon that Problem, might not receive &s;ome further Confirmation, from the Mi&s;take of a certain blind Man, who, as it is reported, upon his being fir&s;t brought to Sight, could not di|&s;tingui&s;h, by that Sen&s;e, a plain Superficies, from a prominent Body; or the Figures of Men painted in Colours, all even, upon a Canvas, or Wain&s;cot Picture, from tho&s;e of living Per&s;ons; but was greatly &s;urpriz'd at his Di&s;appointment, that he could not find tho&s;e Figures, as Men, by feeling, no le&s;s than he though he had found them &s;uch, by his Sight: And being told they were only the artificial Imitations of Men, in their Size, Shapes and Proportions, by the well-di&s;po&s;ed Lights, and Shades of Colours, he a&s;ked, <HI>Why then, which of the Two is the</HI> lying <HI>Sen&s;e?</HI> He meant, the <HI>deceived</HI> Sen&s;e, not yet having had the Experience of knowing the Proverb, That <HI>Seeing</HI> is <HI>believing,</HI> but <HI>Feeling,</HI> the <HI>Truth.</HI> And it may &s;till be further con&s;ider'd, whether <HI>external</HI> Objects, when render'd vi&s;ible, by the Cure of a blind Per&s;on, may not contradict, or at lea&s;t confound the <HI>internal</HI> Conceptions he had of them, before he could &s;ee; and whether they may not, to the Eye, which is fir&s;t brought to the Sight of them, become thereby rather <HI>le&s;s</HI>

<P>THIS being pre&s;umed the Ca&s;e, it may render his Nomination of tho&s;e Things accountable, and clear him from the Objection that was made to the <HI>Beggar of St. Albans</HI>; who pretending to have been miraculou&s;ly endow'd with perfect

<P>At the next opening of the Boy's Eye, the Per&s;ons attending to dre&s;s it, &s;aid it appear'd very clear; and then, be&s;ides the Things with|in Doors, he took Notice of the Barn, and other Out-hou&s;es; and, in the Letter of his Father's afore&s;aid, I find it atte&s;ted that, <HI>He had never felt any Pain,</HI> &s;ince the fir&s;t Operation.

He reply'd that, <HI>He only went thither to catch the Moon.</HI> When I &s;aw him, &s;ome Weeks after he had received this new Sen&s;e, I ob&s;erved, the Eye which was brought to Light, was, in all due Motion and Symetry, very clear, lively, and bri&s;k; but it &s;eemed more infantine, or as if it belonged to a Body, younger than one even
<PB N="21" REF="29">
of his Years; not looking methought, &s;o &s;trong, bold, and ample in the Pupil, as if it had been longer exercis'd in the Reception of various Objects. He is a Lad of a plea&s;ant A&s;pect, fair Complexion, with Features &s;oft, and agreeable; al&s;o of a &s;prightly and chearful Temper; and has a quick or ready Ear for Mu&s;ic; in&s;omuch that, to &s;everal Tunes play'd before him, on the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Flute, he would join in Concert with his Hands, by drumming them over, at the &s;ame Time, upon the Table.</P>
<P>WHETHER he was, as yet, but &s;hort-&s;ighted, thro' the Want of &s;ome tran&s;parent Humour, in the room of that which was depre&s;s'd, or he only appear'd &s;o, thro' his Ignorance of the proper Space, at which he might di&s;tingui&s;h his Ob|jects, I will not decide; but it was remark'd that, when &s;ome Money was laid on the Table; Gold, Silver, and Copper; and he was bid to take up a Guinea, or a Shilling, he would look, as it were, fir&s;t for the Table; then, upon &s;everal Parts of it, before he found where the Money lay; and when he perceiv'd it, by hold|ing his Head down very near it, he would offer to &s;natch at the Piece he aim'd at, two or three Times before he could reach it, becau&s;e he could have no Notion of Di&s;tances; which made him before &s;o little afraid of being at the Top of the Hou&s;e, and think, from thence, of catching the Moon.</P>
<P>IT is credibly atte&s;ted that, the ingenious Mr. <HI>King,</HI> who reads Lectures upon Optics, and
<PB N="22" REF="30">
other Parts of Philo&s;ophy, has a&s;&s;erted that, all Objects, to a Per&s;on who is fir&s;t brought from Blindne&s;s to Sight, do appear inverted; and that, he confirm'd him&s;elf in the &s;ame Opinion, by &s;ome Experiments which he made upon this Boy; who having a Pin held up before him, of which he had been taught to di&s;tingui&s;h the Point from the Head, and being bid to touch the Head, he laid his Finger upon the Point of it. The &s;ame Mi&s;take he committed in three &s;everal Attempts; upon which, the Gentleman who made the Experiments &s;mil'd, and &s;aid, <HI>He knew it would be &s;o.</HI> Tho&s;e who have &s;eem'd unwilling this Mi&s;take &s;hould be a&s;crib'd to the Objects appearing to the Boy inverted, are not &s;atisfied belike in &s;ome Doubts; as <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Whe|ther the Boy's Mi&s;take was not owing, in this Trial, no le&s;s to his Ignorance of Situations, as to <HI>higher</HI> and <HI>lower,</HI> or <HI>right</HI> and <HI>left,</HI> than it was in others before, to his Ignorance in the Di|&s;tances of Things, <HI>further</HI> or <HI>nearer?</HI> And <HI>Se|condly,</HI> they thought it very extraordinary, that the Eye, fram'd, and intended by Nature, mo&s;t exactly and con&s;tantly, to reflect and report, the true unperverted, Po&s;itions of Objects, &s;hould, as in Submi&s;&s;ion to one of her mo&s;t capricious Operations, be at fir&s;t, &s;o unnaturally di&s;pos'd, as to behold tho&s;e Objects in the mo&s;t fal&s;e, un|faithful, and prepo&s;terous Po&s;itions; and yet, &s;o change to the utmo&s;t Extream, as to rever&s;e, rather than ratify the Habit, by further Practice of the &s;ame Organs, in the &s;ame Manner, upon
<PB N="23" REF="31">
the &s;ame Objects; &s;o that tho&s;e Things which appear'd to the &s;ame Eye, one while up&s;ide down, &s;hall appear at other Times, or at all Times after, upright, and on their proper Ba&s;is! Whether &s;uch Appearances of Objects in the Rever&s;e, might be owing to any In&s;ufficiency in one of the Humours, upon the Vacancy made by the Removal of the opaque and phlegmatic Ob&s;truction; whether to &s;ome Irregularity, &s;ome Indi&s;po&s;ition in the <HI>Retina,</HI> or in any other Mediums to the Sen&s;ory in the Brain, which were not yet &s;ettled in their due Place or Proportion, by Exerci&s;e, and Experience in proper Di&s;tances, for a true Reflection of Objects, we need not here &s;o much con&s;ider, as whether &s;ome Light into the Cau&s;e, might not be reflected from the u&s;ual Experiments, with an ordinary Convex Gla&s;s; which being held to any Characters or Images near at hand, &s;hall only magnify, but not re|ver&s;e them; and yet the &s;ame Gla&s;s, held almo&s;t at Arms Length, towards tho&s;e Objects, at a further Di&s;tance, &s;hall both dimini&s;h, and turn them all top&s;y-turvy.</P>
<P>So that to &s;ee Things fir&s;t in this Manner, how much &s;oever it may have of Truth or Fact in it, and therefore may be le&s;s rare and uncom|mon; yet is it no le&s;s remarkable, in this Boy, and all in his Ca&s;e, to have been endow'd with that Faculty <HI>really,</HI> which was long &s;ince ob&s;erv'd <HI>ap|parently,</HI> in another Boy, mention'd by old Dr. <HI>William Bulleyn</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his Dialogue of the Pe&s;tilence. 80. 1569. Fol. 55. b.</NOTE>, who tells us, <HI>He had two Sights</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="32">
<HI>in one Eye.</HI> And if &s;uch the Property be, or Ob|jects do after that Manner, appear inverted, at their fir&s;t Admi&s;&s;ion to the &s;o long ob&s;tructed Organ of Sight, it may po&s;&s;ibly illu&s;trate the blind Man's Similitude in the Go&s;pel; who being brought to the U&s;e of that Sen&s;e, and a&s;ked, if he could &s;ee any Thing, an&s;wered that, <HI>He &s;aw Men like Trees, walking.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark viii. 24.</NOTE> For, however he knew the Trees at fir&s;t Sight, enough to name them, Men revers'd, or &s;tanding upon their Heads, with their Arms and Legs, as it were, branching uppermo&s;t, are more like Trees, and in that &s;up|po&s;ed Po&s;ture have oftner of old been compared to them, than when they &s;tand upon their Feet. And what makes it more credible, that this Man was at fir&s;t confus'd with the Sight of tho&s;e Men in &s;uch perverted Attitudes, is, that in the very next Ver&s;e, it is &s;aid, after he had been touch'd again, by the &s;ame all-healing Hand, that <HI>He was restor'd, and &s;aw every Man clearly:</HI> That is, di|&s;tinctly and perfectly, in his real, and proper Po&s;ture.</P>
<P>OTHER, and more remarkable Ob&s;ervations might perhaps have been made, had any Thoughts of pre&s;erving and recommending them to pub|lic Application or Intelligence, been de&s;ign'd at the fir&s;t bringing of this Boy to Sight; and &s;everal philo&s;ophical Elucidations in the Doctrine of Vi&s;ion, might al&s;o perhaps be further made, from the Particulars above, were it nece&s;&s;ary or convenient to be more exten&s;ive and circum&s;tan|tial in this Place thereon.</P>
