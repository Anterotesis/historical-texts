<HEAD>The fir&s;t <HI>Clau&s;e</HI> of a <HI>LETTER</HI> from the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> to the <HI>In|cumbents</HI> of all <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Chapels</HI> in his Dioce&s;e, concerning their not u&s;ing any <HI>New Forms of Doxology,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is an In&s;tance of your Care and Du|ty, which I conceive my &s;elf at this time highly obliged to offer, and you to regard, as ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Pre&s;ervation of the very Foundations of our Faith. Some Per&s;ons &s;educed, I fear, by the &s;trong Delu&s;ions of Pride and Self-conceit, have lately publi&s;hed new Forms of Doxology, entirely agreeable to tho&s;e of &s;ome Ancient Hereticks, who impiou&s;ly denied a Trinity of Per&s;ons in the Unity of the Godhead. I do therefore warn, and charge it upon your Souls, as you hope to obtain Mercy from God the Father, through the Merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, and by the Sanctification of the Holy Gho&s;t, Three Per&s;ons and One God Ble&s;&s;ed for ever, that you imploy your be&s;t Endeavours to pre|vail with your &s;everal Flocks to have a great Ab|horrence for the above mentioned new Forms, and particularly that you do not &s;uffer the &s;ame to be u&s;ed, either in your Churches, or in any Schools where you are able to prevent that mo&s;t pernicious Abu&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHO' I have not the Honour of being One of tho&s;e Incumbents in your Lord&s;hip's Dioce&s;e, to whom you immediately direct your late Letter again&s;t the U&s;e of <HI>New Forms of Doxology,</HI> &amp;c. Yet becau&s;e I generally frequent one of your Pari&s;h Churches, where a <HI>New Form of Doxo|logy</HI> is every Day u&s;ed; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Hi&s;to|rical Pref. Edit. 2. p.128.&mdash;131.</NOTE> where yet, accord|ing to your Lord&s;hip's laudable Admonition, I di&s;&s;ent from that <HI>New Form of Doxology,</HI> and u&s;e an <HI>Old one;</HI> becau&s;e I &s;everal Years ago at <HI>Cambridge</HI> oppos'd that <HI>New,</HI> and there+fore, by the &s;ame excellent Rule, unju&s;tifi|able <HI>Form of Doxology,</HI> I cannot but think it very fit for me to own the great Plea&s;ure your Lord&s;hip's Caution again&s;t <HI>New Forms of Doxology</HI> has given me; and in my own Name, and in the Name of many other good Chri&s;tians, who, with me, reject all &s;uch <HI>New Forms of Doxology</HI> what&s;oever, I return your Lord&s;hip this Publick Thanks for your &s;o open Approbation of our Conduct in this Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">
I take it here for granted, My Lord, that your Lord&s;hip is in earne&s;t in this Letter; that by <HI>New Forms of Doxology</HI> therein di&s;|approv'd, without any particular mention of the Forms them&s;elves, you truly mean &s;uch as aro&s;e long &s;ince the beginning of the Go&s;|pel; That al&s;o by <HI>New Forms of Doxology, in|tirely agreeable to tho&s;e of &s;ome ancient He|reticks,</HI> your Lord&s;hip particularly means tho&s;e <HI>New Forms</HI> which were introduc'd by certain Hereticks in the fourth Century; tho' your Lord&s;hip &s;eems indeed unhappily to have mi&s;taken their Name and Character.</P>
<P>I take it al&s;o for granted, My Lord, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for a Chri&s;tian and a Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hop, both which your Lord&s;hip is known to be, to call the ancient and &s;acred Doxo|logies of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> St. <HI>Peter,</HI> St. <HI>John,</HI> St. <HI>Jude,</HI> &amp;c. with tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the mo&s;t pri|mitive Chri&s;tians, <HI>New Forms of Doxology, intirely agreeable to tho&s;e of &s;ome ancient He|reticks:</HI> And upon this rea&s;onable Suppo&s;iti|on, I do again return your Lord&s;hip my mo&s;t hearty Thanks for &s;o &s;ea&s;onable and Chri&s;ti|an a Caution again&s;t the modern gro&s;s, and notorious Corruption of this kind.</P>
<P>Now that this &s;olemn Caution of your Lord&s;hip's again&s;t all <HI>New Forms of Doxo|logy</HI> may have the greater regard paid to it by all the Clergy of your Dioce&s;e, I &s;hall beg leave to &s;upply what &s;eems wanting in your Lord&s;hip's Letter, and &s;hall produce here all the certainly genuine <HI>Forms of Dox|ology,</HI> that, upon a former diligent Enquiry, I met with in the Apo&s;tolick Age, or a little later. And that your Lord&s;hip may be &s;ecure that none of them &s;hall be liable to the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;u&s;picion of favouring any dangerous Opini+ons
<PB N="5" REF="5">
that aro&s;e in the fourth Century, your Lord&s;hip will there find that the late&s;t of them is near two hundred Years older than the ri&s;e of either the <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> He|re&s;ies. And I hope this Account may be far|ther u&s;eful to your Lord&s;hip's Clergy, as af|fording them for Practice &s;ure Original po|&s;itive Rules or Forms of Doxology, free from all &s;u&s;picion of <HI>Heretical Pravity;</HI> which al&s;o your Lord&s;hip has intirely omitted to give them in your Letter.</P>

<P><PB N="14" REF="14">
<HI>Note,</HI> (2) That <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> has a full and remark|able <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">De Spiritu Sancto ad Amphilochium.</NOTE> Di&s;cour&s;e upon this Subject; a &s;hort Summary of which only, becau&s;e of its length, I &s;hall here give the Reader; as highly wor|thy of his &s;erious Con&s;ideration upon this Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Ba&s;il</HI> then was accu&s;ed by tho&s;e that di&s;|liked the late Notions and Practices brought into the Church, that he had ventured to alter the old Chri&s;tian Doxology, as to the Particle <HI>in,</HI> which u&s;ed to be given to the holy Gho&s;t; and that he often made u&s;e of <HI>and,</HI> or <HI>with</HI> in|&s;tead of it; as if Glory, and Honour, and A|doration, were to be not only a&s;cribed to the Father, and to the Son, <HI>in</HI> the holy Gho&s;t, or by his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but al&s;o directly <HI>to</HI> the holy Gho&s;t him&s;elf, as to a proper Object of Chri|&s;tian Adoration or Doxology. In an&s;wer to which he owns that the Form <HI>in</HI> the holy Gho&s;t is indeed certainly the ancient and un|doubted Chri&s;tian Form of Doxology; and that he will &s;ometimes make u&s;e of it &s;till accordingly; that however the other Forms <HI>and</HI> or <HI>with,</HI> if they be not really genuine and original in Doxologies, which yet he would willingly in&s;inuate, they have however been u&s;ed upon other Occa&s;ions indifferently; that even in Doxologies he is not the fir&s;t that has u&s;ed tho&s;e Particles, concerning the Holy Gho&s;t; but that &s;everal great Men had done the like before him; at lea&s;t &s;ince the begin|ning of the third Century, as he proves by particular In&s;tances; and that he therefore looks upon it as a piece of <HI>Arian</HI> or Heretical Inclination to be &s;o &s;crupulous of keeping to this one old Particle <HI>in,</HI> out of Oppo&s;ition to
<PB N="15" REF="15">
tho&s;e that would &s;hew their Orthodoxy by the u&s;e of the other Particles, <HI>and</HI> or <HI>with</HI> the holy Gho&s;t. This is the Purport of <HI>Ba&s;il</HI>'s Rea&s;on|ing in this Ca&s;e. And I own that if Pruden|tials mu&s;t govern, and Chri&s;tians are at li|berty to make them&s;elves a new Object of direct Invocation or Doxology from remote Inferences of their own, and out of Compli|ance with a prevailing Party, <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> may be in the right, as well as tho&s;e that follow him in the&s;e Matters. But if Divine Wor&s;hip is on|ly to be given in &s;uch a Manner, and to &s;uch Objects, as Divine In&s;titution ordains, He and all the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> run a great Hazard in &s;uch Matters, and mu&s;t have a heavy Account to give of this their ra&s;h and unju&s;tifiable, and unchri&s;tian Procedure at the great Day. [Vid. <HI>Collection of Monuments, p.</HI> 124-126.]</P>
<P>The former Doxologies, My Lord, and many of the latter al&s;o are for certain the Old, the Chri&s;tian, the Apo&s;tolical Doxologies; &s;ome Centuries before <HI>Arius</HI> or <HI>Arthana&s;ius</HI> were known in the World; by which Men gave Glory, and Prai&s;e <HI>to</HI> God the Father, the Fountain and Origin of all Beings what|&s;oever; together <HI>with,</HI> or <HI>through</HI> the Media|tion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his Only-begotten Son; and <HI>by</HI> the Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Holy Spi|rit.</P>
<P>And that your Lord&s;hip does fully ap|prove of this ancient way of Wor&s;hip and Doxology, is plain by your own excellent and remarkable Words to the very &s;ame pur|po&s;e, which indeed de&s;cribe exactly the man|ner of Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip in the three fir&s;t Centuries, <HI>I do warn and charge it upon your Souls,</HI> &s;ays your Lord&s;hip to your Clergy, <HI>as you hope to obtain Mercy from God the Father, through the Merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI>
