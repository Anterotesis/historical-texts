<HEAD>SPEECH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NO common que&s;tion arre&s;ts the &s;erious attention of this Hou&s;e.&mdash;I have li&s;tened, Mr. Speaker, with more than u&s;ual attention to the Speech of the Rt. Hon. Gentleman&mdash;and much as I am di&s;po&s;ed to admire, much as I believe the Hou&s;e may be induced to approve of, the very eloquent harangue which has been ju&s;t now delivered, yet I tru&s;t that I need not remind it, that there are &s;ome que&s;tions of a nature &s;o &s;erious and delicate, which &s;trike home &s;o immedi|ately to our deare&s;t intere&s;ts, that it is peculiarly important that we &s;hould be particularly &s;u&s;picious of the more than ordinary di&s;play of mental exerti|on, and jealous of that unworthily directed eloquence, that would &s;urpri&s;e our approbation to a mea&s;ure re|plete with injury and in&s;ult to Ireland, and, in my opinion, with ruin to the Briti&s;h empire. We have long &s;tood in the mo&s;t trying and difficult &s;ituation, but that cri&s;is, I think, has now arrived, when it be|comes every Gentleman &s;eriou&s;ly to catechi&s;e his heart, before he is led by the eloquence and abilities of the Hon. Chancellor of the Exchequer, to do that which he might in his &s;ober judgment reflect upon with pain, and perhaps have rea&s;on to repent the re&s;t of his life. I con&s;ider the Hou&s;e, at this mo|ment, in that &s;ituation in which it becomes my duty
<PB N="2" REF="3">
to appri&s;e them of the danger of li&s;tening to the &s;pecious arguments by which their minds are at|tempted to be influenced. I took the liberty, la&s;t week, of &s;tating to the Hou&s;e, that whether Go|vernment thought an Union was e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;perity of Ireland, or nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;alvation of both countries, whether the plan by which the Union was to be effected was approved or di&s;approv|ed, yet that in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is of the affairs of that Country, and under all circum&s;tances as appli|cable to both, the mea&s;ure was one which was by no means advi&s;able. It happened the majority of the Hou&s;e differed from my &s;entiments; yet I may ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert, that excepting the Right Hon. Gen|tleman, and one or two more who&s;e opinions u&s;ually coincide with his, there is not one Gentleman, now in the Hou&s;e, who does not from his heart regret that &s;uch a mea&s;ure was ever brought forward in Ireland. The manner in which it has been met in that kingdom, is in my mind an additional rea&s;on of regret that &s;uch a mea&s;ure &s;hould &s;till be ob&s;tinate|ly per&s;evered in in this. It is to be regretted that the Right Hon. Gentleman &s;hould, when the que&s;tion was la&s;t week before the Hou&s;e, have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;o decided a manner. He, unfortunately, and mo&s;t unwi&s;ely, pledged him&s;elf that he would make the mea&s;ure of an Union between this country and Ireland a favourite object; he di&s;tinctly &s;tated that it was a mea&s;ure from which no oppo&s;ition in this Hou&s;e, or in the Hou&s;e of Commons in Ireland, no lo&s;s of popularity, no con&s;ideration of the offence which he might give tho&s;e friends he valued mo&s;t, &s;hould deter him from endeavouring to carry into execution. He has this day, though not quite in &s;uch unqualified terms, repeated that pledge;&mdash;but though he has repeated it, the Hou&s;e has not repeat|ed it; and I conjure every Gentleman in the Hou&s;e, that he will not only refu&s;e by his vote this night to
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&s;anction &s;uch a pledge, but that he will give his vote in &s;uch way as to preclude the hope of its being brought forward on any future time. The Right Hon. Gentleman, by this propo&s;ed mea&s;ure of an Union, has placed Ireland and England in a very awkward and perilous &s;ituation. The two countries are in that peculiar &s;ituation, that it mu&s;t appear evident to every one the Independance of Ireland, and the power of the Right Hon. Gentleman to de&s;troy it, are incapable of exi&s;ting together. He has &s;hewn that one or the other mu&s;t be annihilated; that they cannot co-exi&s;t, unle&s;s indeed the Hou&s;e in its wi&s;dom &s;hall interpo&s;e, and convince him that it will not &s;uffer him to u&s;e his power to the de&s;truc|tion of that Country. He has, by this mea&s;ure, promoted di&s;cord and di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the two countries, at a time when union and co-operation were above all things nece&s;&s;ary; he has been the means of planting the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the Hou&s;es of Lords and Commons in Ire|land; he has traduced the Parliament, as an a&s;&s;embly convicted of being the dupes of an Engli&s;h faction. There remains but one thing more for him to do, which is to rai&s;e the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Commons in Ireland. This, however, he has not, and I tru&s;t he never will be able to effect; and I hope, &s;incerely hope, that the Briti&s;h Nation would rather that that Gentleman was plung|ed in the aby&s;s of public odium, national execration and unrelenting hatred, than that by any wild, de&s;|parate, daring and impolitic mea&s;ure, he &s;hould be permitted to alienate the affection of one country from the other, or &s;trike at the political con&s;equence or commercial pro&s;perity of our dear, valued, faith|ful, brave and generous &s;i&s;ter kingdom. Oh God! Sir, why is it that I interpo&s;e between the &s;y&s;tem of that Right Hon. Gentleman, and the adoption of it on the part of this Hou&s;e? becau&s;e, Sir, it is a &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="4" REF="5">
which is calculated to promote di&s;cord, and an in|veterate alternation of di&s;gu&s;t and antipathy, when union and affection &s;hould be conciliated and con|firmed: it is becau&s;e it is a &s;y&s;tem which mu&s;t as &s;ure as effect follows cau&s;e, promote di&s;gu&s;t and re&s;ent|ment; it is becau&s;e it is a &s;y&s;tem which traduces one of the contracting parties as &s;o low, &s;o de&s;perate, and &s;o degraded; as in energy incapable to retrieve the Country from the calamities under which it has laboured; and in mind &s;o weak, &s;o pu&s;illanimous, &s;o unenlightened; &s;uch a &s;hame and &s;candal to the nation over which it pre&s;ides, as to be the continual dupe of every paltry, de&s;picable Briti&s;h faction; a &s;y&s;tem, in one word, which is now endeavouring to array the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t the Repre&s;entative A&s;&s;embly, of our dear and ju&s;tly valu|ed &s;i&s;ter kingdom.</P>
<P>I frankly and hone&s;tly declare, that by far the greate&s;t part of that Right Hon. Gentleman's &s;peech was in no &s;hape connected with the que&s;tion which he was plea&s;ed to introduce. For near an hour of the time which he occupied the Hou&s;e, I was inclined to &s;uppo&s;e, (if &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition was allowable) either that a &s;tranger had got into the Hou&s;e, and the Hon. Gentleman was replying to &s;ome &s;peech which he had delivered in &s;ome other a&s;&s;embly, or that the Right Hon. Gentleman in the warmth of his imagination, had fancied him&s;elf in the Iri&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, and was warmly engaged to (what by the bye I did not conceive him, adequate on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion) a reply to Mr. Fo&s;ter, on a &s;ubject which was deeply connected with the vital intere&s;ts of that much injured, but rapidly advancing young Country. Not one part of his argument relates to the que&s;tion&mdash;he is propo&s;ing a mea&s;ure by which the rights of an independant nation are to be de&s;troyed and trampled upon; and he thinks he triumphs by endeavouring to &s;hew that the argu|ments
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of Mr. Fo&s;ter are unfounded. The whole of his argument is, that Mr. Fo&s;ter thought the propo|&s;itions in 1785 nece&s;&s;ary to prevent future jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion between the two countries; and the Hon Gentleman thought if the propo&s;itions failed, he would be con&s;idered a u&s;ele&s;s Mini&s;ter. What is to be collected from this, but that both Mr. Fo&s;ter and the Hon. Gentleman &s;u&s;tained fooli&s;h opinions? for it turned out, that although the propo&s;itions did fail, the failure was not the means of introdu|cing jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion between the two coun|tries, nor of producing the re&s;ignation of the Honourable Gentleman. If, indeed, he can &s;hew that the failure of the propo&s;itions had produced all tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters which have &s;ince happened; all tho&s;e &s;cenes of di&s;traction and rebellion which the kingdom of Ireland has witne&s;&s;ed; then I admit the argument would be again&s;t Mr. Fo&s;ter; but has he &s;hewn that to have been the ca&s;e? On the con|trary, the argument relative to Mr. Fo&s;ter &s;tands &s;imply thus: Mr. Fo&s;ter &s;aid, the failure of the Commercial Propo&s;itions would be the ground of future jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion on the part of Ireland. Well! what is the con&s;equence? He now &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"though I did &s;ay &s;o, I find I was mi&s;taken; for it appears to have been the be&s;t means of pre&s;erving its independance."</Q> Sir, there does not &s;trike me the &s;lighte&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency in the pre&s;ent &s;entiments of Mr. Fo&s;ter on the que&s;tion, with reference to tho&s;e he formerly entertained; and the arguments of the Right Hon. Gentleman &s;eem to me to con&s;i&s;t in a &s;ort of repartee unworthy his good &s;en&s;e and abilities.</P>
<P>But though the Right Hon. Gentleman may not have &s;ucceeded in fixing the charge of incon&s;i&s;tency on Mr. Fo&s;ter, yet the tendency of his &s;peech has fully developed the &s;y&s;tem of foul and rank cor|ruption and intimidation by which it &s;eems the
<PB N="6" REF="7">
mea&s;ure is or was to be carried: Does it not throw out an ignominious threat of withdrawing &s;uch commercial advantages as Ireland may derive from her connexion with Great Britain, unle&s;s &s;he ba&s;ely con&s;ents to &s;trengthen that connexion, by the plau|&s;ible and &s;pecious mode, which is now &s;o cruelly &s;ugge&s;ted,&mdash;the &s;urrender of her independence,&mdash;and proclaims to an a&s;toni&s;hed world,&mdash;her di&s;po&s;ition to become a province; though from the earlie&s;t aera of modern Europe to this day, &s;he has had the &s;trength, capability, and power, to retain the charac|cter and con&s;equence of a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate king|dom from Great Britain. Are not the expre&s;&s;ions which we have heard this night an in&s;inuated threat to tho&s;e who look upon a Legi&s;lative independance of Ireland nece&s;&s;ary to the continuance of her pre&s;ent pro&s;perity? for what end could &s;uch &s;candalous and di&s;graceful threats be re&s;orted to, but as the means of intimidation? this is fully corroborated by what follows the taunting ob&s;ervations of the Right Hon. Gentleman;&mdash;ob&s;ervations that evince little re&s;pect&mdash;nay an utter contempt&mdash;either for the Parliament, or the People of Ireland:&mdash;Ireland, he &s;ays, ought at this moment to &s;purn the nature of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and be particularly de&s;irous of embracing the offer of clo&s;er Union:&mdash;And why?&mdash;Becau&s;e &s;uch for&s;ooth is her weakne&s;s, that &s;he is incapable of defending her&s;elf, and mu&s;t therefore rely on the protection of her powerful neighbour to defend her. What was this but calling on a wretched, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, impove|ri&s;hed Iri&s;hman, to &s;urrender every thing dear, and valued, and worth defending, for the privilege of being defended, and when defence would be an object of trifling e&s;timation? What is this but to &s;tate that our protection is to be withdrawn, if &s;he refu&s;es to accede to what is propo&s;ed? (No, no, exclaimed &s;everal Gentlemen on the Trea&s;ury Bench). I repeat that it is the fair and natural in|ference&mdash;he
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&s;ays, that Ireland is incapable of de|fending her&s;elf without our connexion, and that our connexion cannot exi&s;t without an Union&mdash;can any other inference be drawn from &s;uch a mode of rea&s;oning, than that if Ireland refu&s;es the Union, &s;he will be deprived of the protection of this country? But is this language &s;it and proper to be held out? If two countries &s;tand in that relation to each other, that with re&s;pect to the one it has no trade, no commerce, no manufactures, no advan|tage of its own, nothing in fact but what it derives from the other, that it is in a &s;ituation in which it is incapable of defending it&s;elf without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of its powerful neighbour, is it not natural to a&s;k, How it came into that &s;ituation? and may I not a&s;k, How Ireland is in the &s;ituation de&s;cribed by the Honourable Gentleman? a country ble&s;&s;ed with all the advantages which God and Nature ever be|&s;towed, a healthy climate, commodious ports, and a fruitful &s;oil. Is it, let me a&s;k, wi&s;e in the Hon. Gentleman to pre&s;s &s;uch a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and to afford Ireland the opportunity of inquiring how it has happened &s;he is not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e advantages which naturally belong to her; and by the enquiry to learn, that it has been owing to the oppre&s;&s;ive, unwi&s;e, injurious policy of Great Britain, for a period of near three hundred years? The Hon. Gentleman &s;ays he con&s;iders the connexion between the two countries nece&s;&s;ary to each other, and that England is little qualified to do without Ireland; yet he brings forward a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which leads to that ho&s;tility, that may de&s;troy the exi&s;tence of both. With regard to the que&s;tion of the power of Ireland to re&s;i&s;t her enemies, let me a&s;k the Hon. Gentle|man, what inducement he could have for offering the in&s;ult he has to that country? When Ireland had her Volunteers in arms, had &s;he not the means of repelling her foes foreign and dome&s;tic? What
<PB N="8" REF="9">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance did &s;he not afford this country during the American war? Cannot Ireland &s;ay to you, before &s;he &s;uffers you to reproach her with her inability to defend her&s;elf, before &s;he &s;uffers you to reproach her with your 40,000 militia in the heart of the kingdom (for which you have my thanks), could &s;he not &s;ay, give me back the 100,000 Iri&s;hmen who have lo&s;t their lives in fighting your battles? Above 10,000 of her &s;ons have peri&s;hed in the We&s;t Indies alone, in &s;upporting your conte&s;ts, yet you now &s;ay to her, you have weakened your&s;elf, you are at our mercy, and therefore we in&s;i&s;t upon your coale&s;cing with us. But now the Hon. Gen|tleman contends that her weakne&s;s not only leaves her expo&s;ed to ho&s;tile inva&s;ion, but he al&s;o &s;eems to feel that the &s;ame weakne&s;s leaves her at his mercy, and therefore, he will avail him&s;elf of it, to com|pel her to acquie&s;ce in an Union. While this, however, mo&s;t undoubtedly appears to be his real intention, he talks of leaving her adoption of the mea&s;ure to the unbia&s;&s;ed and calm deliberation of her own independent Parliament. Was not this an in&s;ulting mockery? Such, at lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be deemed by men who regard not the words of the Right Hon. Gentleman, but who look at his actions for their true interpretation and import; and when I reflect upon the whole of his pa&s;t conduct, can I believe that this que&s;tion is to be left &s;olely to the unbia&s;&s;ed judgment, to the independant di&s;cretion of the Iri&s;h Parliament? Surely not: and there|fore I mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly appeal to the good &s;en&s;e and the high dignity of the Hou&s;e, not to lend the &s;anction of its authority to the &s;hameful means by which this mea&s;ure is to be forced upon the reluctant feelings of the &s;i&s;ter kingdom. And what, in the name of God, are tho&s;e means? Do we not &s;ee in the fore|mo&s;t rank of them a barefaced and &s;taring corrup|tion, that &s;talks along the land with a pur&s;e in one
<PB N="9" REF="10">
and a &s;courge in the other? Do we not &s;ee intimi|dation exerting its di&s;couraging power in the &s;udden and &s;candalous di&s;mi&s;&s;als of the olde&s;t and be&s;t tried &s;ervants of the Crown, in the removal of a Parnell and of a Fitzgerald? And after this &s;hall we &s;till be told that the adoption of the propo&s;ed mea&s;ure is wholly left to the calm judgment and independant di&s;cretion of the People of Ireland? Or rather, mu&s;t it not be allowed that the whole of this imperious and threatening conduct on the part of Mini&s;ters is a le&s;&s;on and a warning held out to the Iri&s;h Parliament to enforce their a&s;&s;ent, or perhaps to hang over them the terrors of a Di&s;&s;olution, or &s;hew what tho&s;e who &s;till remain in place may ex|pect from the examples of the puni&s;hment that has already been inflicted on &s;ome of the faire&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in Ireland, unle&s;s they &s;acrifice the dictates of their duty and their con|&s;cience to the intemperate imperiou&s;ne&s;s of an head|&s;trong Mini&s;ter? The &s;ame &s;tretch of in&s;ulting power might perhaps al&s;o be re&s;orted to here, if any Gentleman now in office &s;hould venture to con|&s;ult his Con&s;cience and the Con&s;titution, and e&s;pou&s;e the opinion I propo&s;e; the fate of &s;uch a per&s;on mo&s;t undoubtedly would be, to be turned out to|morrow; for we have been frequently told how important and nece&s;&s;ary it is to repre&s;s and puni&s;h fir&s;t &s;ymptom of in&s;ubordination and in&s;urrecttion.</P>
<P>But conceiving, as I do, that the Hou&s;e is not free from the influence ever attained over ea&s;y tempers by bold and ingenious &s;ophi&s;try, appre|hen&s;ive that we are in the &s;ituation of men who ju&s;t begin to free them&s;elves, by a collected vigorous effort, from the chains impo&s;ed by beauty, or the &s;eductive allurements of an amorous &s;portive ima|gination, I mu&s;t adjure the Hou&s;e not to di&s;po&s;e of a que&s;tion that is perhaps to decide for ever whether a great and generous nation is to retain its inde|pendance,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
and by implication, to determine whether a &s;et of Repre&s;entatives cho&s;en by a free People, mu&s;t vote them&s;elves out of exi&s;tence, and give up the liberties, the property, the acknowledged con|&s;titutional rights of their Con&s;tituents, to the do|mination of a power, that, under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, has introduced among them a force, originally &s;aid to be intended &s;olely for their de|fence again&s;t a daring in&s;idious enemy, whom all deprecate, but who is not more to be dete&s;ted than the pretended friend who a&s;&s;i&s;ts only that he may acquire confidence enough to delude, and &s;trength enough to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t think the Hou&s;e has been hurried along by the Right Hon. Gentleman from one degree of tran&s;port to another, until, in the groves of his Ely&s;ium, they have been elated with &s;cenes of grandeur, and fatigued with that variety, or en|feebled with that richne&s;s of pro&s;pect, which is to render enquiry loath&s;ome, and which will inevita|bly prepare the human mind for the reception of any doctrines, however wild&mdash;and any a&s;&s;urance of future advantage, however illu&s;ory. I took an opportunity la&s;t week of oppo&s;ing the mea&s;ure of Legi&s;lative Union with Ireland, in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which, as matter of cour&s;e, was to lead to that que&s;tion. I did &s;o then, as well from a conviction that mea&s;ures of &s;uch magnitude, and of &s;uch novelty, &s;hould always be oppo&s;ed in the infancy of their progre&s;s, as in the contempla|tion of what I naturally anticipated would be the effect of the eloquence of the Right Hon. Gentle|man. I then &s;aid, what I am at this moment pre|pared to repeat, after much con&s;idering the &s;ubject, that under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of Ireland, in this cri&s;is of her convul&s;ed and nece&s;&s;arily di&s;or|dered &s;y&s;tem of polity and general government, it is not only impolitic but un&s;afe to urge, nay even to
<PB N="11" REF="12">
agitate the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of topics, in the i&s;&s;ues of which are to be &s;een developing them&s;elves, the poi&s;on and the horrors, which are to lay the mo&s;t hardy and &s;tout of heart pro&s;trate at the feet of a Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter&mdash;that are to intimidate and appal the mo&s;t heroic &s;pirits. Ireland, in her pre&s;ent temper, mu&s;t be beat into this mea&s;ure, and that Mini&s;ter who &s;hall make the bold experiment of flogging a whole nation into &s;tupid beings, in&s;en&s;ible alike to the duty &s;he may owe her&s;elf, in&s;en&s;ible to the rights of the pre&s;ent generation; and the intere&s;ts of the race yet unborn, as much as to the arrogance and cupi|dity of tho&s;e who &s;hall inflict the blow, or direct the torture&mdash;&s;uch a Mini&s;ter have &s;ecured his minions, but it may not be altogether unbecoming him, if he be de&s;irous ultimately to prevail, to mea&s;ure his power by the force of his antagoni&s;ts', and in the e&s;timation of his means of victory, to &s;eek an antidote again&s;t national pride and local attachments.</P>
<P>Gracious God! Sir, Who would have &s;uppo&s;ed that a Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter, wrapped up in the in&s;olence of power, and that odious &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, the ge|nuine characteri&s;tic of a narrow and impotent under|&s;tanding, rather than of a manly and vigorous intel|lect, would dare in the face of the Iri&s;h Nation, to &s;purn the a&s;&s;ertion of her rights, to fawn and flatter her guiltle&s;s mind, and by &s;eeming to re&s;pect her declared unequivocal opinion, to full her into in|activity, the more &s;ucce&s;sfully to en&s;lave her for ever? But let not the Right Hon. Gentleman deceive him&s;elf whil&s;t he is exerting his ingenuity to deceive Ireland. Let him remember, Sir, that &s;ome plots have been &s;o clo&s;ely wrought, &s;ome mea&s;ures of &s;ur|pri&s;e and delu&s;ion &s;o intricately planned, and at|tempted to be carried into effect with &s;uch novelty of means, that the authors, the actors, even the &s;ub|ordinate characters in the drama, have been them|&s;elves
<PB N="12" REF="13">
entangled in the mazes they have contrived for innocence, and overwhelmed under the ruins of that fabric, which they have erected to overawe the independant.</P>
<P>The Hon. Gentleman &s;et out with &s;aying, he wi&s;hed the que&s;tion to be argued coolly and di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionately, di&s;tinctly expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, that he wi&s;hed to &s;ubmit it to the unbia&s;&s;ed judgment and independant di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Parliament of Ireland; but, Sir, I pay very little attention to the Hon. Gen|tleman's words, I look to his actions; and referring to them, let me a&s;k, Is the que&s;tion left to the un|bia&s;&s;ed judgment and independant di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of Ire|land? Is it not on the contrary apparent, that in order to carry it, corruption is &s;talking through Ireland with a &s;courge in one hand and a pur&s;e in the other? Is that, I a&s;k, leaving it to the unbia&s;&s;ed judgment and independant di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Coun|try? It is the contrary; it is not only a mockery, but an in&s;ult to Parliament. Be&s;ides, how can Parliament tell, how &s;oon the Hon. Gentleman may adopt the &s;ame line of conduct, with regard to the Parliament collectively, as he has done with re&s;pect to individuals? If he has di&s;mi&s;&s;ed individuals for expre&s;&s;ing &s;entiments different to his own, may he not, by the &s;ame rule, di&s;mi&s;s the Parliament too, if it pre&s;umes to oppo&s;e him. The inference is fair. Was it ju&s;t, in the ca&s;e of a Viceroy con&s;ulting his con&s;cience, on a que&s;tion of all others the mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to act according to its dictates, was it, I &s;ay, nece&s;&s;ary to tell him, becau&s;e he did &s;o, he was unfit to be any longer in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice? He &s;ays, that time &s;hould be given to the people, as well in as out of Parliament, to con&s;ider the &s;ubject, and for heats and animo&s;ities to &s;ub&s;ide. I believe, that with re&s;pect to the Iri&s;h Parliament, his intention is, that time &s;hould be given to try the effect of further corruption; and what &s;en&s;ation will be produced

Friend (Mr. Canning) and never did I hear any thing with more poignant regret; for what &s;en&s;ation but that of &s;orrow and regret could ari&s;e in my mind, when I heard that Hon. Friend plead the cau&s;e of bold and barefaced corruption, and thus cloud and contaminate with its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oul fog and baneful breath the pure early morning of his political life? Would he now tell us that the Right Hon. Gentle|man had given a determined pledge, and could not now recede? Why did he? Who called upon him to &s;peak? Was it to encourage his friends in Ireland by a di&s;play of his re&s;olution?&mdash;but that was una|vailing, as the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and deci&s;ion took place there before that encouragement could reach them; but as to the charge of urging intimidation, neither the Right Hon. Gentlemen, nor his Hon. Friend who an&s;wered me on a former occa&s;ion, had thought pro|per to &s;ay a word. His Hon. Friend (Mr. Canning,) from his Parliamentary &s;tanding, could not, indeed, have taken any part in the violation of the compact in 1782, and therefore his Right Hon. Friend &s;tep|ped generou&s;ly forward and claimed all the &s;hame, guilt, and treachery of it to him&s;elf.&mdash;Like another <HI>Ni&s;us</HI> he threw his broad &s;hield over his beloved <HI>Euryalus</HI> to protect him from the vengeful re&s;ent|ment of the Iri&s;h nation, calling out to them&mdash;<HI>Me, me,</HI> I, I am the man; wreak all your vengeance up|on me.<Q><L>Me, me, ad&s;um qui feci, in me convertite ferrum,</L>

<P>Then, with re&s;pect to the rejection of the que&s;tion by the Parliament of Ireland, the Hon.

What does he mean? That he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> till the Parliament of Ireland is convinced by rea&s;oning? No, he will wait till a day or an hour of additional weakne&s;s, when the country &s;hall be &s;till further incapacitated for re&s;i&s;ting their enemies, and more intimidated at the con&s;equence of our withdrawing our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. What does he mean by &s;aying he will wait? Does he mean he will wait till a period, as one which may or may not arrive, when he knows he has it in his power to create it whenever he thinks proper? It &s;eems the Hon. Gentleman has now been fifteen years with this &s;y&s;tem of an Union rankling in his heart, but has never thought proper to bring it forward till the pre&s;ent moment.&mdash;What conclu&s;ion will the people of Ireland draw from &s;uch conduct? Have they not a right to &s;uppo&s;e, if the mea&s;ure was never propo&s;ed in the hour of their &s;trength and pro&s;perity, but is attempted when they are weakened and unable to re&s;i&s;t, that it is not in|tended as a mea&s;ure of advantage to them? If when a Lord Lieutenant was &s;ent over to heal the differen|ces re&s;pecting the Catholics; if when the cup was at their lips, it was da&s;hed away, and that Lord Lieutenant withdrawn; if the ho&s;tilities of the Ca|tholics and the Prote&s;tants were not nece&s;&s;ary for him to attend to, what mu&s;t they con&s;ider of his conduct when he attempts to introduce an alteration at a time when their weakne&s;s prevents them from re&s;i&s;t|ing it? Does he think that he will by &s;uch a mea&s;ure,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
&s;o carried into effect, produce a permanent connexion between the two countries? Does he not con|&s;ider what will be the feelings of men &s;o provoked?&mdash;But is this the real argument of one who wields the power of national will? When we have already pledged our&s;elves to &s;upport that independant le|gi&s;lation which Ireland claimed as its right, what rea&s;on have we to &s;uppo&s;e that if we attempt to de&s;troy that pledge, we &s;hall not drive that country to the expedient of gaining a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and repelling our attacks? The Hon. Gentleman treated the pledge of this Hou&s;e and the Government, at the la&s;t Ad|ju&s;tment in 1782, as a circum&s;tance of a &s;illy and trifling nature. Among other terms of &s;corn and opprobrium he calls it mo&s;t childi&s;h; at the time he made this a&s;&s;ertion he was not arrived at his full ex|perience; he had been but a year and an half in office; but I &s;hould like to know what the conduct of the Hon. Gentleman's pre&s;ent collegues had previou&s;ly been? He reviles the Duke of Portland and the other Mini&s;ters who were then in power. There was a Gentleman, now a Noble Lord, I can't remember all the new Noble Lord's names, but he was con&s;idered the mouth-piece of tho&s;e who carried that bu&s;ine&s;s into execution. He brought up the re&s;olutions, and it will be &s;ound they pa&s;&s;ed <HI>nemine contradicente.</HI> Surely, the Hon. Gentleman will plead his tender years at the time, for not remem|bering this, for it was much about the time when he had the application of Heaven-born Mini&s;ter be&s;towed upon him; but he &s;ays the re&s;olutions were con&s;idered as childi&s;h, becau&s;e there was one tacked to them which &s;tated, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to do &s;omething further. It is quite enough for me to know that there could not be any fraud intended by this la&s;t re&s;olution; that it could not be con&s;idered as a <HI>caveat</HI> again&s;t that admi&s;&s;ion of the independance of Ireland which had been before acknowledged.
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Ireland &s;ays, "We will have an independant Parlia|ment&mdash;Right&mdash;but to defeat that, we will put in the journals what &s;hall have the effect of defeating the claim. I am per&s;uaded it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch a hard con&s;truction can be put upon that re&s;olution. It is libellous to &s;uppo&s;e that any one could mean it in that light. But I will tell you, Sir, to what the re|&s;olution alluded:&mdash;It was meant that with regard to commerce between the two countries, &s;omething further &s;hould be done; but as to the Con&s;titution of Ireland and its Independance, that was finally ad|ju&s;ted. It was &s;uppo&s;ed, that on the &s;ubject of com|merce &s;omething might ari&s;e which it might be ne|ce&s;&s;ary afterwards to refer to the arbitration of Par|liament. But why was not the Hon. Gentleman's opinion followed up? Why did he adhere to this &s;illy pledge? I believe in the very next year, 1783, when this &s;ubject was again brought forward by Mr. Flood, the Hon. Gentleman did not think of &s;aying there was &s;omething more to be done; though he mu&s;t be now &s;uppo&s;ed to have been convinced that &s;omething further was nece&s;&s;ary, yet he did not inti|mate that opinion; but now, at the di&s;tance of fifteen years, he &s;tates there is a nece&s;&s;ity for following it up. Why has he &s;o long delayed? Becau&s;e he never before thought he had a favourable opportunity; becau&s;e he never before thought Ireland was at his mercy; and now, as the means of carrying his &s;y&s;|tem into effect, he mu&s;t look forward to tho&s;e feuds and di&s;cords which may weaken Ireland, and lay her &s;till more at his mercy. With his u&s;ual lofty tone and carriage he again and again repeats, that an Union is the only remedy that can heal the evils that afflict Ireland, or that can &s;ecure the &s;alvation of both countries. He mu&s;t, therefore, per&s;i&s;t in it, and call on Parliament to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the execution of the mea&s;ure; he is willing, however, to wait for a more favourable opportunity, and until the Iri&s;h
<PB N="17" REF="18">
Parliament is convinced of its nece&s;&s;ity, And what is that opportunity he pretends to wait for&mdash;is it not the day and hour when Ireland &s;hall be in a greater degree of weakne&s;s? Does he wait until he can again reproach her with her inability to defend her&s;elf, and threaten her with withdrawing tho&s;e commercial favours &s;he receives from England, and from which, he contends, are derived all the &s;ources from which her pro&s;perity ari&s;es? Alas! it is but too much in his power to create that moment! And here, let me conjure, let me entreat the Hou&s;e to recollect the &s;hameful manner in which Lord Fitz|william was recalled from Ireland, at a moment when he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;ent over to grant to the Roman Catholics the rights and privileges which they claimed. The cup of conce&s;&s;ion was ju&s;t pre&s;ented to their lips, but in&s;tead of permitting them to ta&s;te of it, it was da&s;hed in their faces. Was this the proof of a &s;incere de&s;ire to reconcile the Roman Catholic body? And if he is acquainted, as &s;urely he is, with the workings of the human heart, mu&s;t he not be well aware of what men will do when &s;o provoked?&mdash;We all agree, continued Mr. Sheridan, re&s;pecting the nece&s;&s;ity of a connexion be|tween the two countries, and that nothing could be more fatal to either than that Ireland &s;hould be po&s;&s;|e&s;&s;ed by the French. Should we not then &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider how far the enforcing of this mea&s;ure may tend to favour what the Right Hon. Gentleman calls the favourite object of the enemy, and which I really believe to be their earne&s;t wi&s;h, namely, the Inva|&s;ion of Ireland. Seeing it as I do, in this light, have I not every rea&s;on and motive for imploring the Hou&s;e not to give it any further countenance? Indeed in every view I can take of it, it appears to me not only to be dangerous, but as Childi&s;h a &s;cheme as that which the Right Hon. Gentleman has cho&s;en to &s;tigmati&s;e &s;o frequently with that epithet.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">
In the long and laboured calumnies of the Right Hon. Gentleman, my valued, my e&s;teemed friend, Mr. Fox, has not e&s;caped from the indecent accu|&s;ation of a proud, &s;ullen and domineering arrogance, &s;ee with what indecency he taunts my honourable friend with not having followed up the re&s;olution of 1782&mdash;when he knows full well that that uni|form friend to the peace, property and independence of Ireland, remained but two months after in office, and therefore could give it no effect&mdash;but did the Right Hon. Gentleman him&s;elf, when he came af|terwards into power, attempt to bring forward the objections which he had this night &s;o triumphantly urged? Had he not now been fifteen years a Mi|ni&s;ter, without ever endeavouring to do that which from the fir&s;t he deemed to be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary?&mdash;He &s;ays, that in the Hou&s;e of Lords in Ire|land there was a decided majority in favour of the Union; that in the Commons it was nearly equal; and that out of doors the large&s;t party were in fa|vour of it;&mdash;but, Sir, look to the qualities of the divi&s;ion; again&s;t the Union were all the country Gentlemen, while tho&s;e in favour of it were per|&s;ons in office, and men of no reputation for inde|pendency of political character. What is the in|ducement to the mea&s;ure held out in Cork? it is &s;aid that its marine will be &s;trengthened, and that it will have a dock-yard.&mdash;In the north of Ireland, it is &s;tated that if the mea&s;ure is not acceded to, they will lo&s;e the advantages of their Linen Trade; thus a bribe is held out to one, and a threat to the other.&mdash;The Hon. Gentleman &s;ays he mu&s;t be a&s;|&s;ured of the continuance of the connexion with Ireland, and then he &s;ays that the Union is the only way to continue it. Is this his propo&s;ition or not? I &s;ay it is &s;o. But I defy him to mention any one advantage which he offers to Ireland for their acceptance of the Union, which he might not give
<PB N="19" REF="20">
without that condition. For in&s;tance, the &s;ubject of Tithes has been mentioned; it is &s;aid that ar|rangements are to be made re&s;pecting them; but permit me to a&s;k him whether, if the propo&s;ed ar|rangements are right, they cannot as well be car|ried into effect without the Union as with it? He has &s;aid that every enlightened politician on the continent is convinced what an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength it would be to this country if Ireland was united to it (by the way, I don't like this quoting the opini|ons of continental politicians); but notwith&s;tand|ing their opinions, let me a&s;k whether, in pur&s;uing his favourite &s;ubject, he is not more in danger of acting as the Ally of the French, than of a&s;&s;i&s;ting Ireland to repel their attempts? If France knows that Ireland is &s;o far &s;ubdued that &s;he is unable to re&s;i&s;t an attack on her independence, will not that a&s;&s;urance be the means of her taking tho&s;e mea&s;ures by which &s;he may be enabled to &s;trike that dread|ful blow &s;he has &s;o long aimed, namely the Separa|tion of Ireland from Great-Britain?&mdash;The Honour|able Gentleman next comes to the que&s;tion of the advantages to accrue to Ireland by an Union with this country. He &s;kips over the advantages &s;he has acquired &s;ince 1782, and proceeds to give an ac|count of Scotland &s;ince the Union, and an ar|gument &s;trongly urged in favour of the Union, is the pro&s;perity which Scotland is &s;aid to have enjoy|ed &s;ince it has been united with England:&mdash;but might not Scotland have attained this increa&s;e of wealth and pro&s;perity merely by dint of her own indu&s;try? Be&s;ides, Scotland cannot well be com|pared with Ireland:&mdash;in Scotland the Gentlemen of property are fond to re&s;ide, and to encourage trade, agriculture, &amp;c.; in Ireland it is the very rever&s;e. Whether without the Union, Scotland would not have been in as good a &s;ituation as &s;he is now, is more than I can determine; but is it not true that Ire|land
<PB N="20" REF="21">
pro&s;pered from the moment when &s;he &s;hook off her ignominious dependence, and in&s;i&s;ted on a free and independent legi&s;lation? It is argument found|ed on mere gue&s;s and hazard to &s;ay, that after the Union Ireland will derive an increa&s;e of progre&s;|&s;ive advantages beyond what &s;he has enjoyed &s;ince 1782.&mdash;Then he &s;ays that the endeavours of our legi&s;lature may, in the cour&s;e of &s;ixteen years, be de&s;eated by the legi&s;lature of Ireland. He argues not from what has been, but from what may be. I may &s;ay that the two Parliaments have now, for above 100 years, gone on co-operating with each other without exception. With regard to what is called the Declaratory Law, he knows that the terms of that law never created any apprehen&s;ion, that it was always con&s;idered as a dead letter. I a&s;&s;ert that there has been a co-operation of 100 years be|tween the two Parliaments, except only in the in|&s;tance of the Iri&s;h Propo&s;itions. It is merely an at|tempt to entrap and impo&s;e upon the Hou&s;e, to &s;tate, that a ca&s;e may occur in which the operations of legi&s;lation may be defeated by the want of co-ope|ration in one of the Hou&s;es of Parliament of the two countries. It may as well be &s;aid, if we &s;end a bill to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and they do not ap|prove of it&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"See the mi&s;chief of having two Hou&s;es of Parliament who&s;e functions impede each other:"</Q> or if we &s;end a money-bill, and they think proper to make &s;ome alteration in it, we may make the &s;ame objection. If you rea&s;on of what may be, and not of what is, only &s;ee the inconveni|ence of the argument, particularly in a Con&s;titu|tion like ours, compo&s;ed of three branches, King, Lords and Commons: it goes to the de&s;truction of the Con&s;titution altogether; for the Lords may on &s;ome que&s;tion be again&s;t the Commons, the Com|mons again&s;t the Lords, or the King again&s;t both; and the&s;e different e&s;tates acting diametrically op|po&s;ite
<PB N="21" REF="22">
to each other, you would make an argument of their de&s;truction. Thus it is evident, when you argue again&s;t experience and fact, you argue again&s;t the exi&s;tence of one of the be&s;t Governments that ever was formed for the protection of the liberty, and property of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The Hon. Gentleman next came to the &s;tate of France, re&s;orting to his old argument of the de|&s;truction of order and regular &s;y&s;tem of Govern|ment. French principles and Jacobini&s;m were, as u&s;ual, introduced into the debate, and made the &s;ubject of &s;plendid invective.&mdash;But what was Jaco|bini&s;m?&mdash;Was it not Jacobini&s;m that pretended to make other States more <HI>free, independent,</HI> and <HI>pro&s;perous</HI> than it found them?&mdash;Was it not Jaco|bini&s;m that called on other countries <HI>to re&s;ign their freedom,</HI> their <HI>independence,</HI> and their <HI>Con&s;titutions,</HI> with a promi&s;e to &s;ub&s;titute &s;omething better in their place? I agree with him in what he &s;tates of the conduct of the people of that country. Indeed it is wa&s;te of time to paint the enormities of the French Government toward the people of France, or their atrocities toward the King of Sardinia.&mdash;Tho&s;e pa|thetic de&s;criptions which have been &s;o often re|peated, are of as little effect as the attempts of Ger|manicus, who is recorded by Tacitus to have en|deavoured to rai&s;e the fury of the &s;oldiers, by paint|ing in &s;trong colours the indignities his brother's body had received, when it was well known to the army he had no brother. I agree that the conduct of France, where they have attempted incorpo|ration with other countries, is not to be defended; but with re&s;pect to that &s;y&s;tem of Jacobini&s;m &s;o much deprecated by the Right Hon. Gentleman, what is it? Jacobini&s;m is, when under the hypocritical pretence of making a nation free, you in fact take away all they po&s;&s;e&s;s that is worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. And in this view the Hon. Gentleman is the Arch-Jaco|bin of all Europe. He does not know what good
<PB N="22" REF="23">
he is doing the French cau&s;e, when he approaches Ireland with a coar&s;e French hug of fraternity, and reprobates the Republic while he is endeavouring exactly to imitate it. He &s;peaks of the great favours be&s;towed on Ireland, and the acqui&s;itions &s;he has made during the pre&s;ent war. I would, however, have it under&s;tood, and indeed the Hon. Gentleman has admitted, that we did not go to war to gain ac|qui&s;itions, but to prevent the French from making them, to prevent France from overrunning the countries of Europe, and fraterni&s;ing with the people. Have we done this? Have we prevented France overrunning nearly the whole of Europe? No; quite the rever&s;e; and as to the acqui&s;i|tions of Ireland, we have &s;uffered her to par|take in ours. O Magnanimity! O unbounded Liberality! We &s;ay to Ireland, in all we gain you &s;hall go part&mdash;in all our ble&s;&s;ings in this war you &s;hall have &s;hare. What are they? The only ble&s;&s;ings we have to offer them are non &s;nare of the two hun|dred and fifty millions expended in the pro&s;ecution of the war. This is all the ble&s;&s;ing, is all the re|compen&s;e we have to offer to poor pro&s;trate Ireland.</P>
<P>The next argument of the Hon. Gentleman is, the ignorance and want of civili&s;ation of the Iri&s;h. I agree with him in the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e evils&mdash;but from what do they proceed? I &s;ay, it is becau&s;e men of great property do not, as they do in this country, a&s;&s;ociate in a certain degree with the lower cla&s;&s;es; they do not form them&s;elves into a ma&s;s to relieve the poor from poverty and di&s;tre&s;s; they have not the &s;ame motive. That is the &s;ource of the penury and wretchedne&s;s of the people of Ire|land. What is the remedy? The cau&s;e of the evil is, the ab&s;ence of the per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;s e&s;tates in that country; and the remedy you propo&s;e is, an Ab&s;entee Government.&mdash;With re&s;pect to Scot|land, the ca&s;e is very different to what it is relative
<PB N="23" REF="24">
to Ireland. The people of Ireland have not that local attachment to their country, which the people of Scotland po&s;&s;e&s;s. Except a Scotchman leaves his native home for the good of his country, as the Hon. Secretary over the way (Mr. Dundas) has done, he can be content to remain without roam|ing, all his life; but not &s;o with an Iri&s;hman:&mdash;In Ireland, a fa&s;hion of emigration prevails; and &s;hould the mea&s;ure of an Union render it more general among the &s;uperior cla&s;&s;es, the lower will de&s;ert their native &s;oil and all its evils; and therefore the remedy propo&s;ed is calculated to increa&s;e, and give additional poignancy to the weight of that mi&s;ery and poverty already experienced.</P>
<P>The next argument is held out as a lure to the Catholics; he attaches all the mi&s;eries of the coun|try to its religious feuds, and then throws out a lure, that when the Parliament is away, it will be the means of giving freedom to the Catholics. Does he mean that if he thinks Catholic emancipation nece&s;&s;ary, there has been a period &s;ince he has been Mini&s;ter, in which it could not have with propriety been brought forward? In Lord Fitzwilliam's ad|mini&s;tration, will he &s;ay that if, in&s;tead of having been obliged to re&s;cind what that Nobleman held out, he could not have carried the plan into effect with the general approbation of the country? Sir, if the Parliament of Ireland find that the di&s;union, weakne&s;s, and di&s;cord, by which the country is torn, have created the opportunity for wre&s;ting its independance; if, in con&s;equence of this impre&s;|&s;ion, it has recour&s;e to union in&s;tead of di&s;cord, concord in&s;tead of di&s;union, and &s;ets about healing tho&s;e feuds which have de&s;troyed its vigour&mdash;if the Parliament and the People of Ireland were to unite, perhaps, it may &s;till be able to counteract the de|&s;igns of the Hon. Gentleman. Should I &s;ee that confiding principle &s;pring up in Ireland, I &s;hould &s;till hope to have my wi&s;hes on this &s;ubject reali&s;ed.&mdash;The
<PB N="24" REF="25">
Hon. Gentleman has adverted to the argument of the competency of Parliament to di&s;po&s;e of a que&s;tion of this kind, and to &s;urrender the rights of the people, and make over its own inde|pendance; alluding to what I had &s;aid, he ob&s;erved, I had avoided giving any deci&s;ive opinion; I cer|tainly did avoid &s;peaking deci&s;ively; on the con|trary, I merely urged the impolicy of advancing any &s;peculation on a &s;ubject which he admits to be one fraught with danger and peril. I applaud the wi&s;|dom and temperance of the Iri&s;h Parliament, for not coming to any deci&s;ive opinion re&s;pecting the com|petency of the Iri&s;h Parliament. He ob&s;erved, that in the ca&s;e of Scotland, the Parliament of Scotland &s;urrendered their rights in the &s;ame manner as is propo&s;ed with re&s;pect to Ireland. He argues, that if the Parliament of Scotland was not competent to do &s;o, you, Mr. Speaker, have no right to &s;it where you do; and that every public legi&s;lative act performed in this Hou&s;e for Scotland is the re&s;ult of u&s;urpation. Surely, a more Childi&s;h argument was never advanced. If there exi&s;ts a &s;mall Monarchy, no matter what is its &s;ize, and it is part of the King's coronation oath that he &s;hall not barter the independance of the Government, as has been done in the German Empire by the Margrave of An&s;pach to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; &s;till if he does make the &s;urrender, there can be no que&s;tion of the right by which the Power to whom he &s;urrenders his Kingdom exerci&s;es the acts of Sovereignty and Legi&s;lation. Wales, though not for a con&s;iderable time incor|porated in the Briti&s;h Government, yet when it was annexed, no doubt was made as to the loyalty of our acts of Legi&s;lature for that part of the king|dom. If others violate the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, it does not follow the acts of the Government in who&s;e favour the tru&s;t is violated are not binding.

of the kingdom, were called on to &s;end Members to Parliament, no doubt was entertained of their legal capacity to legi&s;late tho&s;e places.&mdash;But becau&s;e we have the power of &s;o legi&s;lating, where a &s;ur|render has been duly made, yet it does not follow that tho&s;e are guilty of u&s;urpation who &s;urrender the rights of others, by a&s;&s;uming a power of di&s;po&s;al incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of their tru&s;t!</P>
<P>It is not my intention, Sir, to oppo&s;e going into a Committee, but I &s;hall certainly object to your leaving the Chair, for the purpo&s;e of moving two re&s;olutions, which I &s;hall, in ca&s;e the propo&s;itions &s;hould be carried, wi&s;h to have placed before them, for the purpo&s;e of taking off, in &s;ome degree, that jealou&s;y which the Iri&s;h Parliament, I am afraid, will be apt to entertain of their pa&s;&s;ing this Hou&s;e, after the mea&s;ure of Union having been &s;o decidedly rejected in the Hou&s;e of Commons of Ireland.</P>
<P>And now Mr. Speaker, let me conjure and im|plore the Hou&s;e, not to con&s;ider this que&s;tion, as a que&s;tion of party. I know that factions and parties exi&s;t among&s;t us; the influence and prerogative of the Crown have found their advocates among the People's Repre&s;entatives, but on great que&s;tions the Hou&s;e has often di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf, by laying a&s;ide all paltry, petty, party con&s;iderations,&mdash;when the good faith, the honour, the &s;afety of England and the &s;incere good-will of Ireland were the &s;ubject of con&s;ideration;&mdash;I tru&s;t that the integrity of Par|liament will ri&s;e above the murderous and de|va&s;tating ambition of a Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter;&mdash;I hope you will &s;it on this mea&s;ure, as if the character of the land was involved;&mdash;and that you will not de&s;i&s;t until it is completely overthrown:&mdash;Remem|ber the proud-&s;pirited character of the Iri&s;h Na|tion,&mdash;remember the &s;tate of your dome&s;tic af|fairs,&mdash;remember the eventful cri&s;is of the political

world;&mdash;do not, I conjure you, take a mean ad|vantage of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of that country, or &s;ub|&s;cribe to a &s;y&s;tem of eva&s;ion, of &s;ubtilty, low cun|ning, and in&s;idious artifice&mdash;becau&s;e it is cloathed with a pompous di&s;play of words, and a ridiculous parade of empty phra&s;es, on the exten&s;ion of the mo&s;t wild and vi&s;ionary commercial advantages to Ireland, which ever deluded the di&s;ordered ima|gination of the mo&s;t hair-brained Politician;&mdash;do not, I entreat you, violate your mo&s;t &s;olemn guarantee, and break your faith pledged by &s;tipu|lation;&mdash;di&s;dain to be guided by any ba&s;e, fal&s;e, and oppre&s;&s;ive conduct to your Si&s;ter Kingdom;&mdash;degrade not your&s;elves in the e&s;timation of Iri&s;h|men, by a low, underhand, crooked policy:&mdash;you know that the mo&s;t groveling ideas can be conveyed in the mo&s;t inflated language,&mdash;that it is ca&s;y to give a mock con&s;equence to low cavils, and to utter quibbles in heroics;&mdash;abandon the &s;ordid ideas of the mercantile principle on which this ob|noxious mea&s;ure is &s;ounded, and &s;hew that what|ever may be the character of the Mini&s;ter, this Hou&s;e has none of the attributes of the Trick&s;ter and the Tyrant; exhibit to your dear, your va|lued Si&s;ter Kingdom, all the captivating characte|ri&s;tic of expended intellect;&mdash;&s;tudy to attain great ends by great means;&mdash;&s;upport truth, protect the weak, relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, and right the in|jured,&mdash;but on no con&s;ideration countenance fraud, rapine, ignominy, inju&s;tice;&mdash;the&s;e are not the times for &s;kulking meanne&s;s, bomba&s;tical prevari|cation, or perverted wi&s;dom:&mdash;I &s;olemnly declare, that in every point of view in which I can con&s;ider the mea&s;ure of an Union, its great and leading features are&mdash;obliquity, fraud, fal&s;hood, &s;olly, treachery, oppre&s;&s;ion,&mdash;the mo&s;t glaring violation of national faith, and the mo&s;t open breach of &s;olemn engagement.</P>
