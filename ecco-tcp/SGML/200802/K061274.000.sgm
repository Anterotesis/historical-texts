<HEAD>The Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> vindi|cated from &s;ome Reflections in a late Pamphlet, <HI>Entituled,</HI> Law|ful Prejudices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving applyed my &s;elf here particularly to the removing of National Prejudices, I doubt not, but it has been expect|ed, I &s;hould &s;peak &s;omething to a late Tract, Entituled, <HI>Lawful Prejudices, &amp;c.</HI> And I acknowledge, the Title &s;eems to call me to that Work.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I have heard much of <HI>Lawful Prejudices</HI> again&s;t the Union, but never &s;aw the Attempt made, till this <HI>Out-of-Sea&s;on-Piece,</HI> to &s;ay no more of it, &s;hew'd it &s;elf in the World.</P>
<P>I forbear Replying to it at large, Not on Account of the Ar|gument, nor of the Performance; In both which, 'tis my Opinion, the Author has acted &s;o much below his Ordinary, that, to me, it is One of the Unaccountable&s;t Things <HI>in that Part of Nature,</HI> how a Man &s;o capable, and that is &s;o de&s;ervedly Admir'd in all other Ca&s;es, could form &s;uch a Piece of Indige&s;ture, <HI>I a&s;k his Pardon, if I am wrong,</HI> as this Piece &s;eems to be.</P>
<P>Whether it was, a New Scene he was to Act, which he was unacquainted with, having ever, till now, Acted with Wi&s;dom, Charity and Ju&s;tice, and when driven <HI>by, Heaven knows, what Influence</HI> out of his Element, like a Traveller out of his Knowledge, he made all his Steps equally irregular, or from what other Confu&s;ion of Thoughts it might proceed, I will not determine.</P>
<P>I decline all Advantages this gives me, and very &s;eriou&s;ly pro|fe&s;s, I &s;hould entirely have declin'd entring the Li&s;ts at all with this Paper, had not the Indecency on the whole Body of Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> obliged me to Ju&s;tify and Defend them again&s;t what, I confe&s;s, I never expected to find them charg'd with, e&s;pecially by the Per&s;on whom common Fame reports to be the Author of this Paper.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="2">
In my Undertaking this, which I think is a Debt I am bound to pay to Truth and Innocence, I &s;hall endeavour, not only, to keep the Rules of Decency and good Manners, but &s;hall take Care, not to break in up|on that Re&s;pect, which I always profe&s;s'd to the very Reverend Author, both in his Per&s;on and Character, and which I &s;hall &s;till retain, not|with&s;tanding this Unhappy Excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>This will prevent me &s;aying any thing, which I am not forc't to, in the nece&s;&s;ary pur&s;uit of Truth, and the ju&s;t Vindication of an Injur'd People: But, in that, I hope, he him&s;elf will pardon me, the &s;ame Plainne&s;s which I de&s;ire to u&s;e with all the World, and which an Hone&s;t Impartiality obliges me to.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay little to the Matter of the National Oath, Solemn Cove|nant, or Sinfulne&s;s of the Union here, I had given my Opinion on that Head before, without the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect of this Gentlemans pre&s;ent At|tempt, and I &s;ee no Rea&s;on, from any thing he has advanc'd, to alter a Word in it.</P>
<P>I think &s;till the National Covenant's not at all concern'd here, nor the Bi&s;hops in the Parliament at all e&s;tabli&s;ht by the Union: Uniting with <HI>England, as already Con&s;tituted,</HI> is neither Con&s;tituting nor Approving their Authority, &s;ince a Prote&s;t again&s;t their Civil Authority clears you of the la&s;t, and you have nothing of Concern in the fir&s;t. But this is not my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I enter upon the Argument he brings again&s;t the Church of <HI>England,</HI> tho I own them maletreated and wrong'd al&s;o, particularly in the Matters of the Sacramental Te&s;t.</P>
<P>I am no more for Bi&s;hops, Sacramental Te&s;ts, or any &s;ort of &s;inful Compliances, than he that is remote&s;t from them: But every Blame &s;hould be plac'd where it ju&s;tly falls.</P>
<P>But I come to that which has extorted this Sheet from me, and a|gain&s;t my Inclination, driven me to the Nece&s;&s;ity of Debate, with a Gentleman I &s;incerely value, and whom I acknowledge my &s;elf to be no match for. But tho my Re&s;pect for the Author is the utmo&s;t Re|&s;traint upon me; yet I cannot but be a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee a Man of his In|tegrity, and very Reverend Character fall &s;o hard, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>&s;o unhand&s;omly</HI> upon a People, whom once the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was not a&s;hamed <HI>to call Brethren,</HI> and who never have de&s;erv'd this Treatment from <HI>Scotland, much le&s;s Now;</HI> and this is the Cau&s;e of my engaging in the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3">
And with all imaginable Re&s;pect to my Reverend Antagoni&s;t, I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;ay, here he has not done them Ju&s;tice; nay, has gro&s;ly in|jur'd, wrong'd, and ill-treated them: Neither, <HI>which is wor&s;t of all,</HI> is the Fact he charges them with, True.</P>
<P>It has been but the la&s;t Lords day, when in this City a Reverend <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter preached in the Church of the <HI>Grayfriers,</HI> where I was a Witne&s;s, that the Mini&s;try of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> e&s;teem'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Presbyterians as Orthodox, &s;ince they committed to him not only the Pulpit for preaching, but the Admini&s;tration of Ordinances, admitting him to baptize in the &s;ame Pulpit he had preach'd in.</P>
<P>Now 'tis very &s;trange to me, what can be meant by &s;aying, <HI>We cannot tru&s;t the Presbyterian Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> How, Gentlemen, can you tru&s;t them in Sacreds, and not in Civils; admit them to the Function and Right of the Sacred Office, and not veoture them, or join with them in defence of that Office.</P>
<P>If they incline to Epi&s;copacy, will you come &s;o near the brink of A|po&s;tacy to <HI>Prelatick Principles</HI> as to receive &s;uch into the Mini&s;terial Bro|therhood.</P>
<P>Really, if you can unite with them thus, you may unite with them any how, and any where, and to &s;ay, you cannot tru&s;t them, is very hard, <HI>indeed 'tis very hard.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, can you not tru&s;t the <HI>Presbyterian Di&s;&s;enters:</HI> This is beyond all the re&s;t, &s;ince it &s;ingles out tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters, who it may be &s;aid, <HI>you can only tru&s;t,</HI> or tho&s;e who are neare&s;t in Judgment to the Kirk here. And I mu&s;t therefore take the liberty to &s;ay, it is a Bill of Exclu|&s;ion again&s;t the whole Body of Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> directly.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e they are the only Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> you really ought to depend upon, the re&s;t will join with you in Intere&s;t, will a&s;&s;i&s;t and receive mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and be your Friends; but they will never own your Kirk, nor &s;ubmit to your Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>2<HI>ly,</HI> Who of the Di&s;&s;enters will you owne, if not the Pre&s;byterians, the Independents you may approve in Doctrine, but you cannot joyn with them in Church-Government, nor they with you, the Anabapti&s;ts you di&s;owne as Sectaries, and the Quakers as Hereticks, and <HI>'tis the Complaint here,</HI> that the Union will open the Door to all tho&s;e, and let them in to the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who then can tru&s;t, if not the Pre&s;byterians.&mdash;It cannot therefore be any Breach of my Chari|ty, to &s;ay it is a publick di&s;owning the whole Body of Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> as Per&s;ons that <HI>cannot be tru&s;ted.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">
In the next place, I would beg this Gentleman, and all the &s;incere Lovers of the Reform'd Churches in this I&s;land, to Reflect, how Fatal to their General Intere&s;t, how De&s;tructive to the Pre&s;ervation of them, in either their &s;eparate or conjunct Concerns, how directly tending to their intire Subver&s;ion, and how plain an opening the Door to their Confu&s;ion, mu&s;t any De&s;ign of rai&s;ing Jealou&s;ies and Mi&s;under&s;tand|ings between us be.</P>
<P>What is it, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> makes the High Church in <HI>England,</HI> and the Prelati&s;ts here, again&s;t the Union, but the Apprehen&s;ion of an entire In|corporation of Intere&s;ts and Affection, Hands and Hearts, between the Kirk of <HI>Scotland</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England?</HI> If that Union is not the Effect of the other, both Parties are undone, and 'tis the only way to render the Union Dangerous: To commence a Di&s;tru&s;t between us, therefore, is the only Effectual Step to Di&s;appoint the Nations of the Benefit of the Union, continue us all in Jealou&s;ies and Confu&s;ions, and encourage the Enemies of our Peace, to Cru&s;h and In&s;ult us all.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t needs move any Con&s;idering Man, and fill him with Con|cern, that we &s;hould thus be doing that very Work our &s;elves, which all the Powers of Hell, Jacobiti&s;m and Dividers, can never do without us.</P>
<P>It is not for me to enter upon the Character of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> or of their vigorous Defence of them&s;elves, both in their Religious Principles, and Civil Libertys, to the Honour of that great Body, both as Chri&s;tians, and as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men&mdash;. They need it not, the&s;e things are too well known, even to this Reverend Per&s;on him&s;elf, and to all <HI>Scotland,</HI> to need any Repetition.</P>
<P>And how either Pa&s;&s;ion, or want of Charity &s;hould &s;o far prevail on this Per&s;on <HI>at other times</HI> &s;o free from the fir&s;t, and &s;o known for the la&s;t, I am perfectly at a lo&s;s about.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing he charges on the Presbyterians in <HI>England,</HI> is, That their Divines, of which he names only Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> Mr. <HI>How,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Bates</HI> offered to &s;ubmit to Epi&s;copacy, and on this Submi&s;&s;ion which was <HI>but by a few,</HI> and tho&s;e are all dead, he ventures to &s;ay, That <HI>all, or mo&s;t</HI> of them declare for a moderate Epi&s;copacy. And then adds up|on the whole Body that they cannot be tru&s;ted. To clear up this Slander.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I mu&s;t beg this Gentleman to Examine what this Epi&s;copacy was, and to what reduc't to which they offer'd to &s;ubmit; and whe|ther he him&s;elf is not as much a Bi&s;hop as any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prelate would then have been, <HI>Abating the Title of Lord,</HI> which is a Civil, not an Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Dignity.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Then</HI> I de&s;ire him to Examine whether the Bi&s;hops them&s;elves did not reject their Propo&s;al for that Rea&s;on, that it reduc't them all to Presbyters and pari&s;h Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether &s;ome of the greate&s;t Divines in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> have not In&s;ulted the Di&s;&s;enters on that head, That their pretended Sub|mi&s;&s;ion was a Plot again&s;t Epi&s;copacy it &s;elf, that they only acknow|ledged an abrupt and imperfect Superintendency, and that too with intolerable Limitations.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Next,</HI> Whether all tho&s;e very Gentlemen who, he &s;ays, did &s;ub|mit, did not at la&s;t reject Epi&s;copacy, refu&s;e a Complyance, particularly on account of Re-ordination, and the Oath of Induction, and lo&s;e their Livings on that Article.</P>
<P N="5">5. Whether, had they Complyed in his Terms, <HI>it reflects on the whole Body;</HI> and how he can Qualifie him&s;elf to &s;ay, that &s;ome people give the Presbyterians in <HI>England</HI> that Character, without acknowledging it was an Injury to them; &s;ince nothing can be more unju&s;t, than to Charge a Body of Men for the Errors of a few.</P>
<P N="6">6. Whether the Presbyterians in <HI>England</HI> are as far from &s;infull Complyances, or Leaning towards Epi&s;copacy <HI>Now,</HI> as the Presby|terians in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of whom 'tis yet a Que&s;tion, whether an Equality are not Epi&s;copally Inclin'd? And whether it would not be as ju&s;t to Charge the whole Kirk with it, as to Charge the whole Body of Presbyterians in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e of the &s;inful Complyance of a few?</P>
<P>This I cannot but regrate as a hard and Uncharitable Treatment of the Di&s;&s;enters, who have &s;o Vigorou&s;ly and with &s;uch Succe&s;s, Oppo&s;ed the Encroachments of the Church, and &s;tood their Ground to the la&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>But this is not all,</HI> a wor&s;e Charge follows, and in Terms which I am &s;orry to &s;ay, are neither con&s;i&s;tent with Charity or Ju&s;tice; and it grieves me to be forc'd in the ju&s;t Defence of the Ab&s;ent and In|jured People called Di&s;&s;enters, to Charge any man, much le&s;s this Gentleman with want of Truth. His Charge is,</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That <HI>the Di&s;&s;enters</HI> did &s;o far Countenance and Favour the Di&s;|pen&s;ing Power, by the Tenor of their Addre&s;&s;es, that in&s;tead of &s;ilently Receiving the Benefits of the Indulgence, they &s;et up for Advocats to &s;upport it, and that to re&s;cue them&s;elves from the Severity of one Law, they gave a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ow to all Laws, <HI>&amp;c. pag.</HI> 9.</Q></P>
<P>I hope our Author will not attempt to come off of the Charge, by his putting it with a Some&s;ay in the Front, &s;ince he either believes it, or would have it believ'd, or el&s;e 'tis not to his purpo&s;e; and if he does not believe it, he ought to have quoted it as a Slander.</P>
<P>Note here, he does not &s;ay &s;ome of the Di&s;&s;enters, But THE DISSENTERS, which I think is allowed to be a General, and to &s;ignifie the Di&s;&s;enters as a Body of people, &s;o call'd and di&s;tin|gui&s;ht.</P>
<P>If he means only <HI>&s;ome of them,</HI> it will do him no Service; for <HI>&s;ome al&s;o</HI> rejected the Propo&s;al of Addre&s;&s;ing, with Contempt.</P>
<P>If he will have <HI>the Majority</HI> Determine it, tho&s;e that refu&s;ed it were <HI>Twenty for one,</HI> and &s;o 'tis again&s;t him; and <HI>no body</HI> did it.</P>
<P>If he means they did it as THE DISSENTERS, or in Gen|ral, <HI>'tis fal&s;e in Fact,</HI> and he will not pretend to it; &amp; yet this Gentle|man tells us, THE Di&s;&s;enters did it, and leaves the World to conclude it was the whole Body of Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>This is very hard and very unkind, and I am &s;orry I am forc't to Examine &s;o far into it. But to &s;tate the Fact fairly will end the whole Di&s;pute.</P>
<P N="1">1. That many of the Di&s;&s;enters were ignorantly drawn in, to Thank the King for what was the Effect of an illegal Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, viz. <HI>Granting a Toleration;</HI> without con&s;idering that there lay hid <HI>a Snake in the Gra&s;s</HI> again&s;t their Laws and Civil Liberties, is acknow|ledged.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Artifices of the Court, their Me&s;&s;engers, <HI>Booted A|po&s;tles,</HI> Engines, and Contrivances, wheedled &s;ome well-meaning ignorant People into the Snare, is al&s;o not to be hid, which wicked Crew have been detected, and &s;ome of them u&s;ed as they de&s;erv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> Contemned by all hone&s;t men, and particularly by the very people they Deceiv'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Repentance of, and Amends made by the People <HI>&s;o Deceiv'd,</HI> their firm Adherence to Liberty, and their Principles <HI>ever &s;ince,</HI> has been Eminent to the Overthrow of all tho&s;e that formed that Horrid Delu&s;ion upon them, and <HI>No man &s;hould Reproach a Penitent.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="7" REF="7">
4. And <HI>when all is done,</HI> the&s;e were but a few, and &s;o few as bear no Proportion <HI>worth notice,</HI> to the Number of the Hone&s;t Di&s;&s;enters, that to the la&s;t Oppo&s;ed tho&s;e Illegal Proceedings&mdash;, and to &s;ay it was THE DISSENTERS, a Term General, and Embracing the the whole as a Body, is mo&s;t Un&s;ufferably Injurious.</P>
<P N="5">5. As to the General, <HI>Viz.</HI> Addre&s;&s;ing or thanking the King for his Indulgence; Our Author is al&s;o mi&s;taken, in his Charging the Di&s;&s;enters, unle&s;s he make it appear that any of tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, Recogniz'd the King's Right of Di&s;pen&s;ing with the Laws.</P>
<P>The Liberty of Con&s;cience they thank't him for, 'tis true was their Native Right, and their Right as Chri&s;tians; it had been withheld from them by an Unju&s;t and Illegal Per&s;ecution&mdash;. Now tho a man Re&s;tores me my Right, which another Invaded, I may thank him for the Fact, tho it was a Debt to Ju&s;tice, without joining in his re&s;erved De&s;ign, becau&s;e I am obliged in Civility, to him that Deli|vers me from Oppre&s;&s;ion, tho it be his Duty to do it. El&s;e all Our Addre&s;&s;es to King <HI>William,</HI> or Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty may be Cen&s;ured al&s;o&mdash;, to &s;ay the King did it with an Evil De&s;ign is not to the purpo&s;e, unle&s;s tho&s;e that gave the Thanks knew that De&s;ign, which Thou&s;ands at that time were not Convinc't of, and as &s;oon as they were Convinc't, abhorred the De&s;ign, and publickly Oppo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>So far then as any of the Di&s;&s;enters in their Addre&s;&s;es Own'd the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws, and the King's Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, &s;o far they are to be Charg'd; but if this Gentleman was to Examine how many he can Charge with that, he would be far from lay|ing it upon the whole Body for &s;o Scandalous a Few.</P>
<P>I might refer him home al&s;o, and Enquire whether there was no Addre&s;&s;ing here at the &s;ame time, and whether &s;ome even of the Mini&s;ters in <HI>Scotland, I care not to Collect Names,</HI> did not Addre&s;s on the &s;ame Head, and thank the King for the very &s;ame thing&mdash;. And 'twould be very hard if I &s;hould from thence Charge the Kirk of <HI>Scotland</HI> with Countenancing the Di&s;pen&s;ing Power of King <HI>James,</HI> but the Ju&s;tice would be the &s;ame, if I &s;hould.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Accounts, I think the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> ill-treated, and I am, I confe&s;s not a little Surpriz'd that the&s;e things being of &s;uch recent Memory, &s;hould &s;lip the Thoughts of any Man; for certainly, if &s;uch Addre&s;&s;es were made here by Mini&s;ters them&s;elves,
<PB N="8" REF="8">
it &s;hould have been the la&s;t thing any Mini&s;ter here &s;hould have done to reproach the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> with, and I make no Doubt this Gentleman will, when he reflects on this, do &s;o much Ju&s;tice as to acknowledge his Error.</P>
<P>I &s;hall Enter into none of the Arguments brought together, <HI>How|ever abruptly</HI> again&s;t the Union. The Thing is Over, and the Debate u&s;ele&s;s, and I hope the Effects will &s;oon Convince the Nation of the Benefit: My De&s;ign is not an An&s;wer to the Book, but a Vindication of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> from &s;ome of the wor&s;t Treatment I ever remember them to have met with, from One of their own Brethren in my Time, and I think with the lea&s;t Provo|cation.</P>
<P>I Humbly and Sincerely Recommend it to him, to Reflect on the Unkindne&s;s and Inju&s;tice of it, and to make &s;uch amends to the Good Name of his Brethren, as his own Re&s;pect to Ju&s;tice, &s;hall per&s;wade him, is their Due.</P>
