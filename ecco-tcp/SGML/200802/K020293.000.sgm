<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>BY this light but it is&mdash;What! Bill Breeze!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my gentle Zephyr! <STAGE>(&s;haking hands)</STAGE> Why, where have you hid your&s;elf?&mdash;But I beg par|don&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I make no &s;ecret of my &s;ituations; I've been obliged to lodge for a few weeks on the other &s;ide of the water; it was forcibly recom|mended to me by a doctor well &s;killed in con|&s;umptive ca&s;es. <STAGE>(quaintly.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="4">
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you find your&s;elf the better for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazingly; for I've now got rid of all tho&s;e lurking &s;ymptoms which are the too frequent at|tendants on genius, and letters.&mdash;So, I find they have had &s;ome flogging work over both cour&s;es in my ab&s;ence: the different &s;tuds have been run hard, eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hard?&mdash;<HI>puff'd</HI> all round;&mdash;&s;carce a leg to &s;tand on!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the knowing ones have been taken in, you touch'd a little, Breeze, I hope!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a ducat!&mdash;No, Zephyr, all my pro&s;pects fell with the <HI>coalition;</HI>&mdash;at the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on, indeed, I offered my &s;ervices <HI>here;</HI>&mdash;but I was delicately told&mdash;that authors now-a-days took upon them&s;elves the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k of <HI>criticizing</HI> their own pieces; and at as to the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of the theatre, a gentleman of e&s;tabli&s;hed reputa|tion had undertaken to do the whole upon a &s;tanding contract!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould have met with &s;imilar neglect on the other &s;ide of the way, if it had not been for my new invented play-hou&s;e machine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Play-hou&s;e machine! a kind of theatrical <HI>Buza|glo,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, occa&s;ionally to keep the hou&s;e warm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Conceitedly,)</STAGE> Oh, no! you'll never gue&s;s it;&mdash;will you promi&s;e me the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Pon my honour&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Half whi&s;pering)</STAGE> Why, then, you mu&s;t know I call it (and I think rather aptly)&mdash;I call it&mdash;an <HI>Applauder!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Applauder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, an <HI>Applauder;</HI> a mechanical improvement on the vulgar art of manucu&s;&s;ion; by which one man, with the &s;imple winch of a barrel-organ, &s;hall give a more mark'd and judicious applau&s;e, than can po&s;&s;ibly be derived from any &s;tationary band of hireling clappers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad that <HI>is</HI> a happy invention!&mdash;but pray, Zephyr, wont it tend in &s;ome mea&s;ure to counteract the <HI>real</HI> plaudits of an impartial audience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, quite the contrary; for as clapping, like gaping, is nothing more than an involuntary accordance of mu&s;|cular motion, I will engage, my dear Breeze,&mdash;barring rheumatic and gouty ca&s;es,&mdash;to carry every hand on any particular occa&s;ion, in uni&s;on with my Applauder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very capital idea upon my &s;oul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, I don't &s;ee why the benefit of it may not be extended to the performers; then you know the actors and actre&s;&s;es of a certain <HI>natural diffidence,</HI> need not &s;o often be laid up, by the chilling damps of <HI>&s;ilent</HI> admiration!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly my dear friend.&mdash;But when will it come out Zephyr?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Almo&s;t immediately; the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay was to have been made on a late <HI>mu&s;ical occa&s;ion;</HI> but the author and compo&s;er, not being able to &s;ettle which of the parts de&s;erved the "<HI>mo&s;t deci&s;ive bur&s;ts</HI> of <HI>univer&s;al applau&s;e,</HI>" the machine was laid by, and the matter left as u&s;ual to the deci&s;ion of hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o you are come here, I &s;uppo&s;e to offer it al&s;o to this Hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, I have convey'd away the <HI>copy-right;</HI> and the managers of both Theatres are now contending for an exclu&s;ive patent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Do you do any thing in the <HI>parlia|tary</HI> way now, Zephyr?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a <HI>metaphor!</HI> that branch fell to nothing when gentlemen fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to the fatigue of carrying their <HI>own</HI> FLOWERS to <HI>market!</HI>&mdash;No, having a little
<PB N="12" REF="8">
lei&s;ure upon my hands, the prompter &s;aid he would recommend me as diurnal colouri&s;t to the young author of this night's piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's droll enough! why, I am waiting here my&s;elf in hopes of procuring a &s;imilar employ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! why, then, if that's the ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e we conduct the matter jointly, and &s;hare the profits?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart:&mdash;&s;o, if you'll undertake to waft him through the pacific ocean of the mi|nini&s;terial prints, I'll engage&mdash;but &s;oft; here, I fancy, comes the young author;&mdash;and a <HI>martial</HI> one I &s;ee by his appearance.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter AUTHOR, in an officer's uniform, <HI>(looking round.)</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's &s;trange I &s;hould never be able to catch tho&s;e &s;cene-painting gentry!&mdash;<HI>Wild</HI> &s;aid they would meet me here at half pa&s;t five; <STAGE>(looking at his watch)</STAGE>
<PB N="13" REF="9">
I fear we &s;hall not arrange the &s;cene for the la&s;t act before the piece begins&mdash; <STAGE>(they advance)</STAGE> Oh, gentlemen, I'm glad we've met at la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Wild, Sir, I take it for granted&mdash;</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes; but he &s;ays we've not a moment to lo&s;e!</P>

<P>True, Sir, I thought you'd be in a hurry, &s;o we took care to be prepared.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad of it; and how do you intend&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, as it's a fir&s;t attempt, and times are tickli&s;h, I don't think it advi&s;eable to give any thing too highly colour'd at pre&s;ent, and therefore I have &s;ketch'd &s;omething in the oblique way, which I con|ceive however will have a fine effect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand you; in the <HI>&s;ide wing</HI> way; but in that ca&s;e how &s;hall we di&s;play the performers to ad|vantage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ZEPHYR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, dear Sir, never fear them; they are able, and willing enough to take care of them&s;elves!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, for my part, I think there is nothing like a good bold outline at once, to take in the <HI>flats.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUTHOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well gentlemen, I'm indifferent whether the &s;cene be a <HI>flat,</HI> or an <HI>oblique</HI> one, provided its effect be &s;trik|ingly convey'd to the galleries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BREEZE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, lud Sir, make your&s;elf perfectly ea&s;y on that &s;core;&mdash;my de&s;igns <STAGE>(pulling out his papers)</STAGE> are cal|culated for all cla&s;&s;es; <STAGE>(gives him one)</STAGE> there Sir, ju&s;t run your eye over that; I think that will reach the <HI>Gods,</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI>'s in it!</P>

<P>Yes, <HI>puffs,</HI> Sir: an airy in&s;inuating kind of &s;y&s;|tem, which, though generally de&s;pis'd, is more ge|nerally practis'd; that has the addre&s;s to baffle the whole <HI>five &s;en&s;es,</HI> and carry all its points in &s;pite of conviction!</P>
