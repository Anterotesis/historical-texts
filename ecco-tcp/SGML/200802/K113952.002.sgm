<L>On which depends an expedition.</L>
<L>He therefore took of both, 'tis &s;aid,</L>
<L>And as along he chas'd for prey,</L>
<L>To &s;uccour dames, and giants &s;lay,</L>
<L>The&s;e words upon a rock engrav'd he read:</L>

<L>" Whoe'er would gain the glorious prize,</L>

<L>And now the rock is pierc'd quite thro',</L>

<L>A dragon guards the glorious prize,</L>

<L>" That's very &s;trange, the portrait made reply,</L>

<L>For in the cloth a hole was cut,</L>
<L>Thro' which our man his real face had put,</L>
