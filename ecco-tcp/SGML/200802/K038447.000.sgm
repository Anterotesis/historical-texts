<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been, for &s;ome time, a labourer in the Drama, and finding it nece&s;&s;ary to con|tinue my labours, I cannot help endeavouring to guard the pa&s;t from mi&s;repre&s;entation, le&s;t my &s;upinene&s;s may injure the future. Con|&s;cious that a prejudice has been created again&s;t the Play which I now &s;ubmit to the Reader, and con&s;cious how far I am innocent of rai&s;ing it, it were &s;tupid to &s;it down in &s;ilence, and thus tacitly acknowledge my&s;elf guilty of dulne&s;s;&mdash; dumbly confe&s;s I have been deficient in the knowledge of my trade, damn my&s;elf for a bungling workman, and fix a di&s;repute upon every article which may, hereafter, come from my hands.</P>
<P>Thanks to you, Ladies and Gentlemen! you have been kind cu&s;tomers to me; and I am proud to &s;ay that you have &s;tamped a fa&s;hion upon my goods. Ba&s;e, indeed, and ungrateful were the attempt, after your favours, &s;o long received and continued, to impo&s;e upon you
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
a clum&s;y commodity, and boa&s;t it to be ware of the be&s;t quality that I ever put up to &s;ale! No&mdash; on the word of an hone&s;t man, I have be&s;towed no &s;mall pains upon this <HI>Iron Che&s;t,</HI> which I offer you. In&s;pect it; examine it; you &s;ee the maker's name is upon it. I do not &s;ay it is perfect; I do not pretend to tell you it is of the highe&s;t poli&s;h; there is no occa&s;ion for that:&mdash; many of my brethren have pre&s;ented you with mere <HI>linings for che&s;ts,</HI> and you have been con|tent:&mdash;but, I tru&s;t, you will find that my <HI>Iron Che&s;t</HI> will hold together, that it is tolerably &s;ound, and fit for all the purpo&s;es for which it was intended.</P>
<P>Then how came it to fall to pieces, after four days wear?&mdash;I will explain that:&mdash;but alas! alas! my heart doth yearn, when I think on the ta&s;k which circum&s;tance has thru&s;t upon me.</P>
<P>Now, by the Spirit of Peace, I Swear! were I not doomed to explore the rugged wind|ings of the Drama, I would wrap my&s;elf in mute philo&s;ophy, and repo&s;e calmly under the dark &s;hade of my grievance, rather than endure the pain, and trouble, of this explanation.&mdash; I cannot, however, cry "Let the world &s;lide:" I mu&s;t pur&s;ue my journey; and be active to clear away the ob&s;tacles that impede my progre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am too callous, now, to be annoyed by tho&s;e innumerable gnats and in&s;ects, who daily dart their impotent &s;tings on the literary traveller; and too knowing to di&s;mount, and wa&s;te my time in whipping gra&s;shoppers:&mdash;but here is a &s;cowling, &s;ullen, black Bull, right athwart my road;&mdash;a mon&s;ter of magnitude, of the Boeotian breed, perplexing me in my wander|ings through the entangled labyrinth of Drury!
<PB N="v" REF="4">
he &s;tands &s;ulkily before me, with &s;ides, &s;eem|ingly impenetrable to any la&s;h, and tougher than the Dun Cow of Warwick!&mdash;His front out-fronting the brazen bull of Perillus!&mdash;He has bellowed, Gentlemen! Yea, he hath bellowed a di&s;mal &s;ound! A hollow, unvaried tone, heaved from his very midriff, and &s;triking the li&s;tener with torpor!&mdash;Would I could pa&s;s the animal quietly, for my own &s;ake!&mdash;and, for his, by Jupiter! I repeat it, I would not will|ingly harm the Bull.&mdash;I delight not in baiting him.&mdash;I would jog as gently by him as by the a&s;s that grazes on the common: but he has ob&s;tinately blocked up my way&mdash;he has already to&s;&s;ed and gored me, &s;everely&mdash;I mu&s;t make an effort, or he batters me down, and leaves me to bite the du&s;t.</P>
<P>The weapon I mu&s;t u&s;e is not of that bril|liant, and keen quality, which, in a &s;kilful hand, neatly cuts up the &s;ubject, to the delight, and admiration, of the bye-&s;tanders: It is a homely cudgel of Narrative; a blunt batoon of Matter of fact; affording little di&s;play of art in the wielder; and &s;o heavy in its nature, that it can merely claim the merit of being appropriate to the opponent at whom it is levelled.</P>
<P>Pray, &s;tand clear!&mdash;for I &s;hall handle this club vilely: and if any one come in my way, he may chance to get a rap, which I did not intend to be&s;tow upon him. Good venal and venomous gentlemen, who dabble in ink for pay or from pique, and who have dubbed your&s;elves <HI>Criticks,</HI> keep your di&s;tance now! Run home to your garrets!&mdash;Fools! ye are but <HI>Ephemera</HI> at be&s;t; and will die &s;oon enough, in the paltry cour&s;e of your in&s;ignificant natures, without thru&s;ting
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
your ears (if there be any left you) into the heat of this perilous action.&mdash;A vaunt!&mdash;well, well, &s;tay if ye are bent upon it, and be pert and bu&s;y;&mdash;your folly, to me, is of no moment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ye who impartially, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly, &s;it in diurnal judgment upon modern dramati&s;ts, apply not this to your|&s;elves. It aims only at the malevolent, the mean, and the ignorant, who are the di&s;grace of your order.</NOTE></P>
<P>I ha&s;ten now to my Narrative.</P>
<P>I agreed to write the following Play, at the in&s;tance of the chief Proprietor of Drury-Lane Theatre; who, unconditionally, agreed to pay me a certain &s;um for my labour:&mdash;and this certain &s;um, being much larger than any, I believe, hitherto offered on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, created no &s;mall jealou&s;y among the Parna&s;&s;ian <HI>Sans Culottes</HI>; &s;everal of whom have, of late, been vapidly indu&s;trious to level, to the muddy &s;urface of their own Ca&s;talian ditch, &s;o <HI>Ari&s;|tocratico-Dramatick</HI> a bargainer. The Play, as fa&s;t as written, (piecemeal) was put into re|hear&s;al: But let it here be noted, gentle reader! that a rehear&s;al, in Drury-Lane, (I mean as far as relates to this Iron Che&s;t) is <HI>lucus &agrave;</HI> non <HI>lucendo.</HI> They yclep it a rehear&s;al, I conjecture, becau&s;e <HI>they do</HI> NOT <HI>rehear&s;e.</HI> I call the loved &s;hade of Garrick to witne&s;s; nay, I call the le&s;s loved pre&s;ence of the <HI>then</HI> acting Manager to avow,&mdash;that there never was one fair rehear&s;al of the Play.&mdash;Never one rehear&s;al, wherein one, or two, or more, of the Performers, very e&s;&s;ential to the piece, were not ab&s;ent: and <HI>all</HI> the rehear&s;als which I attended, &s;o &s;lovenly, and irregular, that the ragged ma&s;ter of a theatrical Barn, might have blu&s;hed for
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
the want of di&s;cipline in the pompous Director of His Maje&s;ty's Servants, at the va&s;t and a&s;toni&s;hing new-erected Theatre-Royal, in Drury-Lane.</P>
<P>It is well known, to tho&s;e conver&s;ant with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tage, that no perfect judg|ment can be formed of the length of a Play, apparent to the &s;pectator, nor of the general <HI>effect</HI> intended to be produced, until the private repetitions, among the actors, have reduced the bu&s;ine&s;s into &s;omething like <HI>lucidus ordo:</HI>&mdash; then comes the time for the judicious author to take up his pruning-knife, or handle his hatchet. Then he goes lu&s;tily to work, my ma&s;ters! upon his curtailments, or additions; his tran&s;|po&s;itions, his loppings, his parings, trimmings, dockings, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. As in the writing, &s;o in the rehear&s;al.</P>
<Q><L>"Ordinis haec virtus erit et venus, aut ego fallor;"</L>
<L>"Ut jam nunc dicat, jam nunc debentia dici"</L>
<L>"Pleraque differat, et prae&s;ens in tempus omittat:"</L>
<L>"Hoc amet, hoc &s;pernat, promi&s;&s;i carminis Auctor."</L></Q>
<P>But, woe is me! while I was patiently wait|ing the expected cri&s;is, a circum&s;tance occurred which compelled me to watch a cri&s;is of a le&s;s agreeable nature. A fever attacked me, as I &s;at beneath the damp dome of Drury, and drove me, <HI>malgr&egrave; moi,</HI> to bed; where I lay during a week, till three hours before the Play was exhibited. In addition to the unavoidable injury ari&s;ing from the author's ab&s;ence, Mr. KEMBLE, the acting-manager, and principal performer in the piece, was, and had been for a few days, previous to my own illne&s;s, confined
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
to his chamber, by indi&s;po&s;ition. I lay little &s;tre&s;s, indeed, upon his temporary incapacity to perform his managerical duty; his mode of di&s;|charging it, hitherto, was productive of little benefit to me;&mdash;Still it was <HI>&s;ome</HI> drawback&mdash; for were a mere Log thrown amid&s;t a The&s;pian community, and nominated its dull and ponder|ous Ruler, &s;till the block, while in its place, would carry &s;ome &s;way with it:&mdash;but his non-attendance as an actor, &s;o much engaged in the Play, was particularly detrimental.</P>
<P>Nay, even the Compo&s;er of the mu&s;ick&mdash; and here let me breathe a &s;igh to the memory of departed worth and genius, as I write the name of STORAGE&mdash;even he, could not pre&s;ide in his department. He was preparing an early flight to that abode of harmony, where choirs of Angels &s;well the note of welcome to an hone&s;t, and congenial &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Here then was a direct &s;top to the bu&s;ine&s;s? No &s;uch thing. The Troops proceeded with|out leaders: In the dark, <HI>Me&s;&s;ieur.!&mdash;"Sans</HI> eyes, <HI>Sans</HI> every thing." The Prompter, it is true, a kind of non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer, headed the Corps, and a curious march was made of it!</P>
<P>But, lo! two days, or three, (I forget which) previous to the public repre&s;entation, up ro&s;e King KEMBLE! like Somnus from his ebon bed, to di&s;tribute his dozing directions among his &s;ubjects.</P>
<Q><L>"Tard&acirc; gravitate jacentes"</L>
<L>"Vix oculus tollens;"</L>
<L>"Summaque percutiens nutanti pictora mento,"</L>
<L>"Excu&s;&s;it, tandem, &s;ibi &s;e; cubitoque levatus," &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="8">He came, &s;aw, and pronounced the Piece to be ripe for exhibition. It was ordered to be performed immediately. News was brought to me, in my &s;ickne&s;s, of the mighty <HI>Fiat</HI>; and, although I was told, officially, that due care had been taken to render it worthy of public attention, I &s;ubmitted with doubt and trembling to the decree. My doubts, too, of this boa&s;ted care, were not a little increa&s;ed by a note, which I received from the Prompter, written by the Manager's order, <HI>three hours only,</HI> before the fir&s;t repre&s;entation of the Play:&mdash;wherein, at this late period, my con&s;ent was, abruptly, reque&s;ted to a tran&s;po&s;ition of two of the mo&s;t material &s;cenes in the &s;econd act: and the rea&s;on given for this curious propo&s;al was, that the pre&s;ent &s;tage of Drury&mdash;where the Architect and Machini&s;t, with the judgment and ingenuity of a Politician and a Wit to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, had combined to outdo all former theatrical out|doings&mdash;was &s;o bunglingly con&s;tructed, that there was not time for the carpenters to place the lumbering frame-work, on which an Abbey was painted, behind the repre&s;entation of a Library, without having a cha&s;m of ten minutes in the action of the Play; and that in the middle of an act.&mdash;Such was the fabrication of that New Stage, who&s;e <HI>"extent</HI> and <HI>powers"</HI> have been &s;o vauntingly adverti&s;ed, under the cla&s;&s;ick management of Mr. KEMBLE, in the edifying exhibition of Pantomimes, Proce&s;&s;ions, Pageants, Triumphal Cars, Milk white Hor&s;es, and Elephants!</P>
<P>As I did not chu&s;e to alter the con&s;truction of my Play, without deliberation, merely to &s;kreen the ill-con&s;truction of the Hou&s;e, I would
<PB N="x" REF="9">
not li&s;ten to the mode&s;t, and <HI>well timed</HI> demand, of turning the progre&s;s of my fable <HI>top&s;y turvy.</HI></P>
<P>Very ill, and very weak, from the effects of the fever, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> not, yet, left me, I made an effort, and went to the Theatre, to witne&s;s the performance. I found Mr. KEMBLE, in his dre&s;&s;ing-room, a &s;hort time before the curtain was drawn up, taking <HI>Opium Pills:</HI> and, nobody who is acquainted with that gentleman will doubt me when I a&s;&s;ert, that, they are a medicine which he has long been in the habit of &s;wallowing. He appeared to me very unwell; and &s;eemed, indeed, to have imbibed,
<Q><L>"Poppy and Mandragora,"</L>
<L>"And all the drow&s;y &s;yrups of the world."</L></Q></P>
<P>The Play began; and all went &s;moothly, till a trifling di&s;approbation was &s;hewn to the character per&s;onated by Mr. DODD;&mdash;the &s;cene in which he was engaged being much <HI>too long:</HI> A proof of the neglect of tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to have informed me (in my unavoidable ab&s;ence from the Theatre) that it appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the <HI>la&s;t rehear&s;als,</HI> to want curtail|ment. I con&s;idered this, however, to be of no great moment; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. KEMBLE was to appear immediately in a &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">quent &s;cene, and much was expected from his execution of a part, written expre&s;sly for his powers.</P>
<P>And, here, let me de&s;cribe the requi&s;ites for the character which I have attempted to draw, that the world may judge whether I have taken a wrong mea&s;ure of the per&s;onage whom I pro|po&s;ed to fit: premi&s;ing that I have worked for him before, with &s;ucce&s;s, and, therefore, it
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
may be pre&s;umed that I am &s;omewhat acquaint|ed with the dimen&s;ions of his qualifications.&mdash; I required, then, a man
<Q><L>"Of a tall &s;tature, and of &s;able hue,"</L>
<L>"Much like the &s;on of Ki&s;h, that lofty Jew."</L></Q>
A man of whom it might be &s;aid,
<Q><L>"There's &s;omething in his &s;oul"</L>
<L>"O'er which his melancholy &s;its, and broods."</L></Q></P>
<P>Look at the actor;&mdash;and will any body do him the inju&s;tice to declare that he is deficient in the&s;e qualifications? It would puzzle any author, in any time or country, from Ae&s;chylus down, even, to the Tran&s;lator of <HI>Lodoi&s;ka</HI>&mdash;and really, gentlemen, I can go no lower&mdash;to find a figure and face better &s;uited to the purpo&s;e. I have endeavour'd, more-over, to pourtray <HI>Sir Ed|ward Mortimer</HI> as a man &s;tately in his deport|ment, re&s;erved in his temper, my&s;terious, cold, and impenetrable, in his manner: and the can|did ob&s;ervers, I tru&s;t, will allow that Mr. KEMBLE is thouroughly adequate to &s;uch a per&s;onation.</P>
<P>To complete my requi&s;itions, I demanded a performer who could enter into the &s;pirit of a character proceeding upon romantic, half-witted principles, ab&s;tracted in his opinions, &s;ophi&s;ticated in his rea&s;onings, and who is thrown into &s;itua|tions where his mind and conduct &s;tand, tiptoe, on the extreme&s;t verge of probability. Here, &s;urely, I have not mi&s;taken my man; for if I am able to form any opinion of him, as an Actor,&mdash;and my opinion, I know, is far from
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
&s;ingular,&mdash;his chief excellence almo&s;t approaches that &s;tyle which the learned denominate <HI>Carica|ture.</HI> Po&s;&s;ibility on the &s;tretch, pa&s;&s;ion over-leaping it's cu&s;tomary bound, movements of the &s;oul, &s;ullen, or violent, very rarely &s;een in the common cour&s;e of things, yet &s;till <HI>may</HI> be &s;een &mdash;in the&s;e is his element. As our language is &s;aid to have &s;unk under the va&s;t conception of MILTON, &s;o does the mode&s;ty of nature &s;uffer a depre&s;&s;ion beneath the unwieldy imaginings of Mr. KEMBLE. He &s;eldom deigns to accompany the Godde&s;s in her ordinary walks; when &s;he decently paces the regular path, with a &s;ober &s;tep, and a &s;traight per&s;on: but he kindly a&s;&s;i&s;ts her when &s;he is, doubtle&s;s, in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance &mdash;when &s;he appears out of her way, crazy and crooked.</P>
<P>The arrogant fault of being more refined than Refinement, more proper than Propriety, more &s;en&s;ible than Sen&s;e, which, nine times in ten, will di&s;gu&s;t the &s;pectator, becomes frequent|ly, an advantage to him, in characters of the above de&s;cription.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Mr KEMELE is a paragon-repre|&s;entative of the <HI>Lu&s;us Naturae:</HI> and were Mr. KEMBLE &s;ewed up in a &s;kin, to act a hog in a pantomime, he would act a hog with &s;ix legs better than a hog with four.</P>
<P>If any one a&s;k why I cho&s;e to &s;ketch a <HI>Lu&s;us Naturae</HI> when it might better become an author to be cha&s;te in his delineation, I can only reply that, I did &s;o to obtain the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. KEMBLE in his be&s;t manner; and that now, I do mo&s;t heartily repent me: for never, &s;ure, did man place the main &s;trength of his building upon &s;o rotten a prop!</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="12">Well, the great actor was di&s;covered, as <HI>Sir Edward Mortimer,</HI> in his library. Gloom and de&s;olation &s;at upon his brow; and he was habited, from the wig to the &s;hoe-&s;tring, with the mo&s;t &s;tudied exactne&s;s. Had one of King CHARLES the Fir&s;t's portraits walked from its frame, upon the boards of the Theatre, it could not have afforded a truer repre&s;entation of ancient and melancholy dignity.</P>
<P>The picture could not have looked better&mdash; but, in ju&s;tice to the picture, it mu&s;t al&s;o be added, that, the picture could &s;carcely have acted wor&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;pectators, who gaped with expectation at his fir&s;t appearance, yawned with la&s;&s;itude before his fir&s;t <HI>exit.</HI> It &s;eemed, however, that illne&s;s had totally incapacitated him from per|forming the bu&s;ine&s;s he had undertaken. For his mere illne&s;s he was entitled to pity; for his conduct under it, he, undoubtedly, de&s;erved cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>How can Mr. KEMBLE, as a Manager, and an Actor, ju&s;tify his thru&s;ting him&s;elf forward in a new Play, the material intere&s;t of which re&s;ted upon his own powers, at a moment when he mu&s;t be con&s;cious that he had no powers at all?&mdash;Mr. KEMELE owes a duty to the publick, to his employer, and to an author writing for his employer's hou&s;e. How does he treat the claimants upon his &s;ervice, in this in&s;tance? Exactly, thus&mdash;he in&s;ults the under&s;tanding of the fir&s;t, and injures the intere&s;ts of the two la&s;t, by calling in a crowd to an entertainment which he knows he mu&s;t mar.</P>
<P>I reque&s;ted him, at the end of the fir&s;t act, to order an apology to be made for his indi&s;po|&s;ition,
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
le&s;t the uninformed or malicious, might attribute the pondero&s;ity of the performer to the heavine&s;s of the author. I was anxious to di&s;avow all right and title to tho&s;e pigs of lead which did not belong to me, and of which Mr. KEMBLE was the ju&s;t proprietor. But no&mdash;he peremptorily declared he would not &s;uffer an apology to be made! It &s;hould have been made (if at all) before the play began.&mdash;Then why was it not made?&mdash;He did not, <HI>then,</HI> imagine that illne&s;s would have di&s;abled him.&mdash;So, then, a man quits his chamber, after an attack which has, evidently, weakened him extremely, and he has no bodily feel, no internal monitor, to whi&s;per to him that he is feeble, and that he has not recovered &s;ufficient &s;trength to make a violent exertion!&mdash;This mode of rea&s;oning, adopted by Mr. KEMBLE, is much in the &s;pirit of that clown's, who did not know whether he could play on the fiddle 'till he tried. Be it noted, al&s;o, that Mr. KEMBLE was &s;wallowing his opium pills, <HI>before</HI> the play began, <HI>becau&s;e he was ill:</HI>&mdash;but opium cau&s;es &s;trange oblivious effects; and the&s;e pills mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned &s;o &s;udden a lap&s;e in Mr. KEMBLE's memory, that he forgot when he took them, why he took them, or that he had taken them at all.&mdash;The do&s;e mu&s;t have been very powerful.&mdash;Still, for the rea&s;ons already &s;tated, I pre&s;&s;ed for an apology; &s;till Mr. KEMBLE continued ob&s;tinate in oppo&s;ing it. His indi&s;po&s;ition, he &s;aid, was evident; he had coughed very much upon the &s;tage, and an apology would make him <HI>"look like a fool.."</HI></P>
<P>Good-nature in exce&s;s becomes weakne&s;s; but I never yet found, in the confined cour&s;e of
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
my reading, that good-nature and folly would bear the &s;ame definition: Mr. KEMBLE, it &s;hould &s;eem (and he produced, at lea&s;t, mana|gerical <HI>authority</HI> for it) con&s;idered the terms to be &s;ynonimous. Freely, however, forgiving him for his unkindne&s;s, in refu&s;ing to gratify a poor devil of an author,&mdash;who, very anxious for his reputation, was very moderate in his reque&s;t&mdash;I do, in all chri&s;tian charity, mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h that Mr. KEMBLE may never find greater cau&s;e to <HI>look like a fool</HI> than an apology for his indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>At length, by dint of per&s;everance, I gained my point. A proprietor of the Theatre was called in upon the occa&s;ion, who&s;e mediation in my favour carried more weight with the Acting Manager than a haple&s;s Dramati&s;t's entreaty; and the apology was, in due form, delivered to the audience.</P>
<P>One third of the Play, only, was yet per|formed; and I was, now, to make up my mind, like an unfortunate traveller, to pur&s;ue my painful journey, through two &s;tages more, upon a broken-down Po&s;ter, car who&s;e back lay all the baggage for my expedition. Mi&s;erably, and mo&s;t heavily in hand, did the Po&s;ter pro|ceed!&mdash;He groaned, he lagged, he coughed, he winced, he weezed!&mdash;Never was &s;een &s;o &s;orry a jade! The audience grew completely &s;oured, and, once completely &s;oured, every thing, naturally, went wrong. They recurred to their di&s;approbation of poor DODD&mdash;and ob|&s;erve what this produced. I mu&s;t relate it.</P>
<P>Mr. KEMBLE had ju&s;t plodded through a &s;cene, regardle&s;s of tho&s;e loud and manife&s;t tokens that the Criticks delight not in the
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
<HI>"drow&s;y hums"</HI> with which he <HI>rang night's "yawning peal,"</HI> when DODD appeared to him on the Stage; at who&s;e entrance the clamour was renewed. Then, and <HI>not till then,</HI> did the Acting Manager, who had been deaf as any po&s;t to the &s;upplications of the author for an apology&mdash;then did he appear &s;uddenly &s;eized with a fit of good nature. He voluntarily came forward <HI>"to look like a fool,"</HI> and beg the indulgence of the town. He feared he was the unhappy cau&s;e of their di&s;approbation; he entreated their patience, and hoped he &s;hould &s;hortly gain &s;trength, to enable them to judge, on a future night, what he hand&s;omely termed the <HI>merits</HI> of the Play. Here was friend&s;hip! Here was adroitne&s;s! While the Publick were te&s;tifying their di&s;gu&s;t at the Piece, through the medium of poor DODD, Mr. KEMBLE, with unexampled genero&s;ity, took the whole blame upon his own &s;houlders, and heroically &s;aved the author, by &s;o timely an interpo&s;ition. I was charmed with this ma&s;ter-&s;troke, and, at the impul&s;e of the moment, I thanked him. But, alas! how narrow is the &s;oul of man! how di&s;tru&s;tful in its movements, how &s;canty in its acknowledgments, how perplexing to it&s;elf in its combinations! Had I, afterwards, looked on the thing &s;imply and nakedly, by it&s;elf, why the thing is a good-natured thing: but I mu&s;t be putting other circum&s;tances by the &s;ide of it, with a plague to me! I mu&s;t be puzzling my&s;elf to &s;ee if all fits; if all is of a piece. And what is the re&s;ult?&mdash;Mi&s;erable that I am! I have lo&s;t the plea&s;ure of evincing a gratitude, which I thought I owed, becau&s;e I no longer feel my&s;elf a debtor. Had I abandoned my mind
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
to that placid negligence, that luxurious con|fidence, which the incon&s;iderate enjoy, it had never occurred to me that Mr. KEMBLE, fore|&s;eeing, perhaps, that an aggrieved author might not be totally &s;ilent&mdash;&s;teped forward with this &s;peech to the publick, as a kind of <HI>&s;alvo,</HI> (&s;hould a &s;tatement be made) for his rigidity in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. It had never occurred to me that Mr. KEMBLE was &s;ufficiently hi&s;&s;ed, yawned at, laughed at, and coughed down, to have made his apology <HI>before</HI> Mr. DODD appeared: It had never occurred to me that his making his apology at a previous moment would have an&s;wered the &s;ame purpo&s;e to <HI>me,</HI> and not to <HI>him:</HI> It had never occurred, in &s;hort, that there is &s;uch a thing as o&s;tentatious humility, and a politick act of kindne&s;s; and that I &s;hould have waited the &s;equel of a man's conduct, before I thanked him for one in&s;tance of &s;eeming good will, clo&s;e upon the heels of &s;tubborn ill-nature, and in the mid&s;t of exi&s;ting, and palpable injury. The &s;equel will &s;hew that I was premature in my acknowledgment&mdash;but before I come to the &s;equel, a word or two (I will be brief) to clo&s;e my account of this, the fir&s;t night's, eventful hi&s;tory. The Piece was concluded, and <HI>given out,</HI> for a &s;econd performance with much oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>Friends, who never heard the Play read, &s;hook their heads; Friends, who <HI>had</HI> heard it read, &s;carcely knew it again: Several, I doubt not, of the impartial, who cho&s;e to be active, actively condemned; and enemies, of cour&s;e, rejoiced in an opportunity of joining them.</P>
<P>No opportunity could be fairer. The Play was, at lea&s;t, a full hour too long; and had
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
<HI>Job</HI> him&s;elf &s;at to hear it he mu&s;t have lo&s;t his patience. But, if, gentle reader, thou po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e&s;t <HI>Job's</HI> quality, and ha&s;t followed me thus far, in my Narrative, it will appear to thee (for I doubt not thy retention and combination) that I was unable to curtail it effectually, at the pro|per time&mdash;the la&s;t rehear&s;als. I was, then, laid flat, my dear friend, as you remember I have told you, by a fever. The Acting Manager did attend the la&s;t rehear&s;als, and &s;uffered the piece to be produced, <HI>uncut,</HI> to "drag its &s;low length along" &s;urcharged with all his own incapacity, and all his opium.</P>
<P>How, then, do I &s;tand indebted, according to the articles of this night's &s;tatement? I owe to Mr. KEMBLE,

<P>This account is &s;omewhat like the Tavern bill, picked from Fal&s;taff's pocket, when he is &s;norting behind the arras. There is but one halfpenny worth of compa&s;&s;ion to this intolera|ble deal of blame.</P>
<P>Now for the &s;equel.&mdash;I have &s;hewn, I think, that Mr. KEMBLE, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, under|took a duty which he <HI>could</HI> not perform: I have now to affirm, with all the difficulty of proving a negative full in my face, that he afterwards, made a mockery of di&s;charging a duty which he <HI>would</HI> not perform.</P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="18">After a week's interval, to give him time to recruit his &s;trength; and the Author time to curtail, and alter, the Play; (for the impre&s;&s;ion which the Mi&s;-Manager and Actor, had con|trived to &s;tamp rendered alteration nece&s;&s;ary) it was a &s;econd time repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, here, let the uninformed reader into a &s;ecret;&mdash;but I mu&s;t go to Newmarket to make him under&s;tand me.&mdash;No, Ep&s;om will do as well; and that is nearer home.&mdash;It often hap|pens, at a Race, that a known Hor&s;e, from whom good &s;port is expected, di&s;appoints the crowd by <HI>walking over the cour&s;e.</HI>&mdash;He does not mi&s;s an inch of the ground; but affords not one jot of diver&s;ion, unle&s;s &s;ome plea&s;ure is received in contemplating his figure. Now, an actor can do the very &s;ame thing. He can <HI>walk over his part:</HI> He can mi&s;s no more of his words than the Hor&s;e does of his way: he can be as dull, and as tedious, and as good-looking as the Hor&s;e in his progre&s;s:&mdash;The only difference between the two animals is,&mdash;that the Hor&s;e brings in him who bets upon him a gainer; but the luckle&s;s wight who has a large &s;take depend|ing upon the actor is, decidedly, certain to lo&s;e. There is a trick, too, that the Jockies practi&s;e, which is called, I think, <HI>playing booty.</HI> This con&s;i&s;ts in appearing to u&s;e their utmo&s;t en|deavour to reach the winning-po&s;t fir&s;t, when they are already determined to come in the la&s;t. The con&s;equence is, that all, except the know|ing ones, attribute no fault to the Jockey, but damn the Hor&s;e for a &s;luggard.&mdash;An actor can <HI>play booty</HI> if he chu&s;es:&mdash;he can pretend to whip and &s;pur, and do his be&s;t, when the Connoi&s;&s;eur knows, all the while, he is &s;hirking:&mdash;but
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
Sluggard is the unmerited appellation given by the majority to the innocent author..</P>
<P>Mr. KEMBLE chiefly cho&s;e to be Hor&s;e, and <HI>walked over the ground.</HI> Every now and then (but &s;carcely enough to &s;ave appearances) he gave a &s;light touch of the Jockey, and <HI>played booty.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the language which is put into the mouth of <HI>Sir Edward Mortimer</HI> be above mediocrity, or below contempt, is not to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e: but the words he is made to utter certainly convey a meaning; and the cir|cum&s;tances of the &s;cenes afford an opportunity to the Performer of playing off his mimick emotions, his tran&s;itions of pa&s;&s;ion, his &s;tarts, and all the trickeries of his trade. The devil a trick did Mr. KEMBLE play but a very &s;curvy one! His emotions and pa&s;&s;ions were &s;o rare, and &s;o feeble, that they &s;ea&s;oned his general in&s;ipidity, like a &s;ingle grain of wretched pepper thrown into the large&s;t do&s;e of water-gruel that ever was admini&s;tered to an invalid. For the mo&s;t part, he toiled on, line after line, in a dull current of undiver&s;ified &s;ound, which &s;tole upon the ear far more drow&s;ily than the di&s;tant mur|murings of Lethe; with no attempt to break the lulling &s;tream, or check its &s;leep-inviting cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Frogs in a mar&s;h, flies in a bottle; wind in a crevice, a preacher in a field, the drone of a bagpipe, all, all yielded to the inimitable, and &s;oporific monotony of Mr. KEMBLE!</P>
<P>The very be&s;t Dramatick writing, where pa&s;&s;ion is expre&s;&s;ed, if delivered languidly by the Actor, will fail in it's intended effect: and I will be bold enough to &s;ay that were the <HI>Cur&s;e in King Lear</HI> new to an audience, and they heard
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
it uttered, for the fir&s;t time, in a croak, fainter than a crow's in a con&s;umption, it would pa&s;s unnoticed, or appear vapid to the million.</P>
<P>If I rai&s;e a critical clatter about my ears, by this a&s;&s;ertion, which &s;ome may twi&s;t into a profanation of Shak&s;peare, I leave it to Horace, who can fight battles better than I, to defend me.</P>
<Q><L>"Si dicentis erunt fortunis ab&s;ona dicta,"</L>
<L>"Romani tollent pedites equite&s;que cachinnum."</L></Q>
<P>That Mr. KEMBLE did not mi&s;conceive the Part is certain; for he told me, &s;ome time before the Play was acted, that he feared the exertions requi&s;ite, in <HI>Sir Edward Mortimer,</HI> would &s;train his lungs more than <HI>Octavian,</HI> in the <HI>Mountaineers.</HI></P>
<P>That he can &s;train his lungs, to good purpo&s;e, in <HI>Octavian,</HI> is well known; and, after this, his own intimation, how will he e&s;cape the charge of wilful and direct delinquency, when, with &s;uch a conception of the Part, and with health recovered, he came forward in the true &s;pirit of <HI>Bottom,</HI> and <HI>"aggravated his voice &s;o that he roared you as gentle as any &s;ucking dove?"</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. KEMBLE informed me, previous to the &s;econd re|pre&s;entation of the Play, that he felt him&s;elf capable of exertion.</NOTE></P>
<P>He in&s;ulted the Town, and injured his Em|ployer, and the Author, &s;ufficiently in the fir&s;t in&s;tance: in the &s;econd he added to the in&s;ult and injury an hundred-fold: and as often as he mangled the Character (three or four times, I am uncertain which, after the fir&s;t night's per|formance) he heaped aggravation upon aggrava|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="21">The mo&s;t mi&s;erable mummer, that ever di&s;graced the walls of a Theatre, could not have been a &s;tronger drawback than Mr. KEMBLE.&mdash; He was not only dull in him&s;elf, but the cau&s;e of dulne&s;s in others. Like the baleful <HI>Upas of Java,</HI> his pe&s;tiferous influence infected all around him. When two Actors come forward, to keep up the Shuttle cock of &s;cenick-fiction, if one plays &s;lovenly, the other cannot maintain his game. Poor BANNISTER, Jun. would he &s;peak out (but I have never pre&s;&s;ed him, and never &s;hall pre&s;s him to &s;ay a word upon the &s;ubject) could bear ample te&s;timony to the truth of this re|mark. He &s;uffered like a man under the cruelty of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">zentius.</HI> All alive him&s;elf, he was tied to a corp&s;e, which he was fated to drag about with him, &s;cene after &s;cene, which weighed him down, and depre&s;&s;ed his vigour. Mi&s;s FARREN, too, who might animate any thing but a &s;oul of lead, and a face of iron, experienced the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>I could proceed, and argue, and rea&s;on, and di&s;cu&s;s, and tire the reader, as I have tired my|&s;elf (it is now, my good friend, one o'clock in the morning) to prove, further, that Mr. KEMBLE was un&s;ound in my cau&s;e, and that he ruined my Play:&mdash;But I will de&s;i&s;t here. I think I have <HI>pro&s;ed</HI> enough to manife&s;t that my argu|ments are not unfounded.</P>
<P>They who are experienced in <HI>Dramaticks</HI> will, I tru&s;t, &s;ee that I have made a fair <HI>extenua|tion</HI> of my&s;elf&mdash;they who are impartial will, I hope, be convinced that I have &s;et down <HI>nought in malice.</HI></P>
<P>The only que&s;tion that may ari&s;e to &s;hake, materially, the credit of all I have &s;aid, is&mdash;
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
"How is it probable that Mr. KEMBLE &s;hould injure you thus, without provocation? Is it in nature? Is it in man?" I can merely an&s;wer that I am uncon&s;cious of having given him cau&s;e for provocation; that if I have given him cau&s;e, he has taken a bad mode of revenge; that Mr. KEMBLE's nature has frequently puzzled me in my ob&s;ervation upon it; and that I think him a very <HI>extraordinary man.</HI></P>
<P>But let him take this with him, &s;hould this crudely written Preface ever fall in his way. I have committed it to paper <HI>currente calamo.</HI> I mean no allu&s;ion, no epithet, to apply to him as a private individual. As a private individual I give him not that notice which it might, here, be impertinent to be&s;tow:&mdash;but I have an un|doubted right to di&s;cu&s;s his merits, or demerits, in his publick capacities of Manager and Actor: and my cau&s;e of complaint gives me a good rea&s;on as well as right. His want of conduct, his neglect, his inju&s;tice, his oppre&s;&s;ion, his fine&s;&s;e, his per&s;on, his face, are in this point of view all open to my animadver&s;ion.</P>
<Q><L>"He is my goods, my chattlels;"</L>
<L>"My Hor&s;e, my Ox, my A&s;s, my any thing."</L></Q>
<P>And I would animadvert &s;till further, did I not think I had already &s;aid &s;ufficient to gain the object of guarding my own reputation. That object has &s;olely &s;wayed me in dwelling &s;o long upon a "plain tale," encumbered with &s;o fatiguing a Hero as JOHN KEMBLE.</P>

<PB REF="23">
<HEAD><HI>ADVERTISEMENT</HI> TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>I AM indebted for the ground-work of this Play to a Novel entitled <HI>"Things as they are, or the Adventures of Caleb Williams; written by William Godwin."</HI> Much of Mr. GODWIN's &s;tory I have omitted; much, which I have adopted, I have compre&s;&s;ed; much I have added; and much I have taken the liberty to alter.</P>
<P>All this I did that I might fit it, in the be&s;t of my judgment, to the &s;tage.</P>
<P>I have cautiou&s;ly avoided all tendency to that which, vulgarly, (and wrongly, in many in|&s;tances) is termed Politicks; with which, many have told me, <HI>Caleb Williams</HI> teems.</P>
<P>The &s;tage has, now, no bu&s;ine&s;s with Poli|ticks: and, &s;hould a Dramatick Author en|deavour to dabble in them, it is the Lord Chamberlain's office to check his attempts, before they meet the eye of the Publick. I peru&s;ed Mr. GODWIN's book, as a tale replete with intere&s;ting incident, ingenious in its arrange|ment,
<PB N="xxvi" REF="24">
ma&s;terly in its delineation of character, and forcible in its language. I con&s;idered it as right of Common; and, by a title which cu&s;|tom has given to Dramati&s;ts, I enclo&s;ed it within my theatrical paling. However I may have tilled the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, I tru&s;t he di&s;covers no intentional injury to him, in my proceeding.</P>
<P>To all the Performers (excepting Mr. KEMBLE) I offer my hearty thanks for their exertions; which would have &s;erved me more, had not an actor, <HI>"dark as Erebus,"</HI> ca&s;t a gloom upon them, which none of their efforts, however brilliant, could entirely di&s;per&s;e.</P>
<P>But this does not dimini&s;h my obligations to them:&mdash;&s;o much, indeed, I owe to them, that, when the Play was la&s;t performed, it was ri&s;ing, &s;pite of <HI>Erebus,</HI> in favour with the Town. It was, then, adverti&s;ed, day after day, at the bottom of the Play-bills, for repetition, till the promi&s;&s;ory adverti&s;ement became laughable; and, at length, the Adverti&s;ement and the Play were dropt together.</P>
<P>If, after the foregoing Preface, I &s;hould at a future period, bring the Play forward in the Hay-market Theatre, I am fully aware of the numbers who from party and pique, may now oppo&s;e it. I am aware, too, of the weight which a fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion leaves upon the minds of the mo&s;t candid:&mdash;Still, &s;o &s;trong is my confidence in the genuine deci&s;ion of a London audience, who have a fair opportunity of ex|erci&s;ing their judgment and feelings, (which they have not had, yet, in re&s;pect to this Play) that I believe I &s;hall venture an appeal.</P>
<P>The Piece is, now, printed as it was acted on the <HI>fir&s;t night</HI>; that they who peru&s;e it may
<PB N="xxvii" REF="25">
decide whether, even in that &s;hape, (with all the misfortunes, before enumerated, with which it was doomed to &s;truggle) it &s;hould be, for ever, con&s;igned to moulder on the &s;helf.</P>
<P>The Songs, Duets, and Choru&s;&s;es, are in|tended merely as vehicles for mu&s;ical effect. Some criticks have pompou&s;ly called them <HI>Lyrick Poetry</HI>&mdash;that by rai&s;ing them to dignity they may more effectually degrade them: as men lift a &s;tone very high, before they let it fall, when they would completely da&s;h it to pieces.</P>
<P>I, now, leave the gentle reader to the peru&s;al of the Play&mdash;and, le&s;t my Father's memory may be injured by mi&s;takes; and, in the con|fu&s;ion of after-times, the <HI>Tran&s;lator of Terence,</HI> and the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>The Jealous Wife,</HI> be &s;up|po&s;ed guilty of the <HI>Iron Che&s;t</HI>; I &s;hall, were I to reach the Patriarchal longevity of Methu&s;a|leh, continue (in all my Dramatick publications) to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf</P>
