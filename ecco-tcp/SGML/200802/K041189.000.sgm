<P>AN ODE TO THE GENIUS OF SCANDAL.</P>

<PB REF="3">
<P>THE Author of the following ODE, intending it &s;olely for the amu&s;ement of his intimate acquaintance, printed only the requi&s;ite number of copies. One who has long been happy in his friend&s;hip, and who was favoured with the poem, thought a more enlarged publication might prove beneficial to mankind, in correcting an evil of which every one complains. With this view he offers it to the world, and he hopes the in|tention will ju&s;tify the act.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who, with a ta&s;te for &s;atire, po&s;&s;e&s;s the powers of ridicule, are, by the peru&s;al, awakened to a &s;en&s;e of the un|happine&s;s the indi&s;criminate exerci&s;e of that dangerous talent may po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion to innocence and worth; and if the tranquility of an individual is pre&s;erved, the writer's wi&s;hes will be gratified.</P>
<P>To the Author no &s;uitable excu&s;e can be offered&mdash;but the motive. This, if his delicacy rejects, his heart mu&s;t approve. To the Public no apology will be thought nece&s;&s;ary; the &s;pi|rit and elegance of the compo&s;ition, the philanthropy it breathes, mu&s;t recommend it to encomium, and &s;ecure to it the applau&s;e it &s;o ju&s;tly merits.</P>
