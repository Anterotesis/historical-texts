<P>MY &s;tory is already prefaced; &s;o I need but proceed, repeating as before, after Mrs. Walter.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t ten or twelve days that I pa&s;&s;ed at Paris, the novelty of the &s;cene, with the grandeur and brilliancy of the objects that &s;urrounded me, lifted me, as it were, out of my&s;elf, and helped me for that time almo&s;t to forget my misfortunes. The marchione&s;s made me &s;everal very
<PB N="2" REF="4">
con&s;iderable pre&s;ents, and ordered her trade's people to attend me, that I might chu&s;e my own cloaths, only de&s;iring they might be hand&s;ome enough to appear in along with her.</P>
<P>Madame de Fribourg received a va&s;t deal of company, and kept very late hours; mon&s;ieur de Lovaine was &s;eldom of her parties, and &s;ometimes withdrew him&s;elf intirely from the hou&s;e, for a fort|night together; &s;he u&s;ed to appear di&s;&s;atis|fied at his ab&s;ence, and frequently com|plained to me of the coldne&s;s and con|&s;traint of his manners towards her.&mdash;He u&s;ed &s;ometimes, to vi&s;it me, in my apart|ment, &s;eemed fond of my little Olivia, and often wi&s;hed that he had &s;uch an|other child&mdash;He &s;aid the marchione&s;s's mode of living, was by much too gay and
<PB N="3" REF="5">
di&s;&s;ipated for him, and that he langui&s;hed for the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety in a more rational cour&s;e of life.</P>
<P>Small as was my knowlege of the world, I could not help perceiving that there was &s;omething particular in mon|&s;ieur de Lovaine's addre&s;s, whenever he &s;poke to me; but this circum&s;tance, how|ever, was not of a nature to give offence, as it amounted to nothing more than an additional &s;oftne&s;s, in his looks and voice.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s certainly perceived it as well as I, and would often fix her piercing eyes upon me, and a&s;k me if Colonel Walter was as hand&s;ome as mon&s;ieur de Lovaine? I always replied, as I really thought, that the Colonel was by far the hand&s;ome&s;t man I had ever
<PB N="4" REF="6">
&s;een&mdash;She u&s;ed to appear plea&s;ed with what &s;he called my &s;implicity&mdash;At other times her manners were &s;evere towards me; and, though perfectly convinced of my own innocence, I began &s;oon to fear that I was become the object of her jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>This idea was productive of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences to my peace; it ren|dered my behaviour timid and con|&s;trained, before her, and totally depriv|ed me of that ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s which I had before endeavoured to a&s;|&s;ume, in hopes of rendering my&s;elf agree|able to my kind benefactre&s;s&mdash;This al|teration in me, which her own manners had occa&s;ioned, &s;he con&s;trued into the effect of guilt, and became every day more cold and re&s;erved towards me,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
&s;carce ever a&s;ked me to go out with her, and as often affected to be &s;urpri&s;ed, when &s;he &s;aw me come into her drawing-room.</P>
<P>Though my &s;ituation with the mar|chione&s;s was by no means the <HI>ne plus ul|tra</HI> of my hopes and wi&s;hes, which con|tinually pre&s;&s;ed forward to the meeting of Olivia's father, my &s;till loved, cruel hu&s;band! yet certainly I had rea&s;on to con&s;ider it as an happy a&s;ylum for my child, and me; her bounty had re&s;cued both of us from the iron hand of pover|ty, and placed us in the lap of plenty, of honour, and of ea&s;e! How then could I bear the being &s;u&s;pected of repaying &s;uch benefits with the ba&s;e&s;t &s;ort of in|gratitude! It was impo&s;&s;ible! I deter|mined, therefore, to come to an expla|nation
<PB N="6" REF="8">
with the marchione&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible; to convince her of my innocence, and do all in my power to recover her e&s;teem; but if I failed of removing her &s;u&s;picions, I firmly re&s;olved to quit her directly, to throw my&s;elf and my infant once more into a mercile&s;s world, to la|bour for our bread, and &s;uffer any mi&s;e|ry that poverty could afflict me with, ra|ther than that of embittering her life, to whom I owed the generous &s;upport of my own.</P>
<P>I had revolved this &s;ubject in my thoughts for &s;everal days, and impati|ently waited for an opportunity of exe|cuting my &s;cheme, but the di&s;tance and <HI>hauteur</HI> of madame de Fribourg's man|ner, overawed me &s;till. I found I could not mu&s;ter up &s;pirit &s;ufficient to &s;peak
<PB N="7" REF="9">
to her on &s;uch an intere&s;ting topic, and I re&s;olved, therefore, to communicate my &s;entiments to her in writing.</P>
<P>One evening that &s;he went to the Ita|lian comedy, I retired to my chamber, in order to execute my purpo&s;e; and, that I might not be interrupted, I de&s;ired the maid who attended Olivia, to take her down &s;tairs and amu&s;e her, till I &s;hould ring for her to come up, as I had &s;ome letters of con&s;equence to write&mdash;She withdrew, I bolted my chamber door, &s;at down to the ta&s;k I had a&s;&s;igned my&s;elf&mdash;I found it infinitely more diffi|cult than I had imagined; I wrote, and burned &s;everal &s;heets of paper, and blot|ted, others, with my tears.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, I heard a key turn, as it were behind the arras, and &s;aw
<PB N="8" REF="10">
mon&s;ieur de Lovaine entering by a door which had been till then concealed from me. I &s;tarted up, when he threw him|&s;elf, in&s;tantly, at my feet, &s;aid he had long waited in vain for the opportunity of finding me alone, for a moment, and hoped I would pardon his acquainting me, perhaps, a little too abruptly, with a &s;ecret on which more than his life, his happine&s;s, depended&mdash;to be &s;hort, he then declared his love for me, with all the a&s;&s;everations, prote&s;tations, and tran&s;|ports, that the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>No words can paint the &s;urpri&s;e and confu&s;ion of my mind, which I thought it was impo&s;&s;ible to augment, till I &s;aw the marchione&s;s come in at the door which mon&s;ieur de Lovaine had left open,
<PB N="9" REF="11">
and find him on his knees before me. Luckily for me, I was &s;aved from di&s;trac|tion, by the total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all my faculties; and I &s;unk motionle&s;s in my chair.</P>
<P>Many hours pa&s;&s;ed, before my rea&s;on returned&mdash;My recollection of the events that had happened on the preceding night, was &s;uch as one feels on awaking from a painful dream; yet I flattered my&s;elf I &s;hould &s;till be able to undeceive the marchione&s;s, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;u|rances of my innocence, and though I could never hope to regain her favour, ju&s;tice methought ought to have re&s;tor|ed me to the place I had before obtained in her e&s;teem&mdash;Alas! I knew not then that jealou&s;y, like the adder, is at once &s;harp&s;ighted, deaf, and venomous.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">I ro&s;e as &s;oon as it was day, and upon inquiring for the papers which I left up|on my table, was informed that the mar|chione&s;s had taken them away&mdash;I waited impatiently for her ri&s;ing, I was deter|mined to throw my&s;elf at her feet, the moment I &s;hould be permitted to &s;ee her, to acquaint her with every &s;entiment of my heart, and to &s;et hers at ea&s;e, on my account, by withdrawing my&s;elf from her's, and mon&s;ieur de Lovaine's &s;ight, for ever.</P>
<P>While I was ruminating on my un|happy &s;ituation, a &s;ervant brought me the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Madame D'OLIVET.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the &s;cene I was la&s;t night an <HI>accidental</HI> witne&s;s of, you cannot, I
<PB N="11" REF="13">
&s;uppo&s;e, be weak enough to imagine that it is any longer in your power to impo&s;e upon me; or that all your art, con&s;ummate as it is, can prevail on me to continue my protection to the mo&s;t ungrateful of her &s;ex! Your deep-laid &s;cheme of deceiving me, by that letter, which you and my unworthy hu&s;band had concerted together, cannot now take effect; contempt mu&s;t follow &s;uch a de|tection, and render you as much below my re&s;entment, as you ever were beneath my e&s;teem.</P>
<P>In regard to my&s;elf, I mu&s;t inform you, that though I have long &s;u&s;pected an improper intercour&s;e between mon|&s;ieur de Lovaine and you, I was not ac|tuated by &s;o mean a motive as &s;eeking the conviction I met with, when I enter|ed
<PB N="12" REF="14">
your apartment&mdash;Impelled by the re|gard I once had for you, I was impatient to acquaint you with what I then imagin|ed might have been a welcome piece of intelligence, by informing you, that the per&s;on you call your hu&s;band, is in Paris, and that I had &s;een him at the Comedie.</P>
<P>It did not, at that moment, occur to me, how unwelcome both the news, and the me&s;&s;enger might be to you.&mdash;On inquiring for you when I came home, I was told that you had bolted your door, and given orders not to be di&s;turb|ed, even by your darling child; I knew not but you might be ill, or gone to bed, and therefore, to avoid alarming you, thought of the private door, which your lover had been &s;o carele&s;s as to leave
<PB N="13" REF="15">
open behind him.&mdash;I do not mean this detail as an apology to you, but as a ju&s;tification to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have nothing farther to add, becau&s;e I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it unnece&s;&s;ary to com|mand you to quit my hou&s;e; your new protector will, I doubt not, furni&s;h you with proper accommodation; and from this moment I am determined never to hear, &s;ee, &s;peak, or if po&s;&s;ible think of you, more.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MARIANA DE FRIBOURG.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I &s;at down, on the in&s;tant, and wrote to the marchione&s;s, and, in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t affecting terms, implored her to admit me to her pre&s;ence, for a few mi|nutes&mdash;but in vain; &s;he returned my let|ter unopened, with a me&s;&s;age by her wo|man,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
that &s;he would never read a line that I &s;hould write, or ever &s;uffer me into her pre&s;ence more.</P>
<P>I grew almo&s;t di&s;tracted at this treat|ment, and tried to force my way into her apartment, but was prevented from entering by her &s;ervants, and treated like what I really then was, a poor fran|tic wretch!</P>
<P>The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my integrity might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;upported my &s;pirits, at any other time, but the terrors I felt, le&s;t the marchione&s;s &s;hould &s;ee my hu&s;|band before I did, and poi&s;on his mind with her unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions, were not to be endured&mdash;My &s;ituation was as com|pletely mi&s;erable, as any thing, but guilt, could po&s;&s;ibly have rendered it.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">While I laboured under the&s;e agoniz|ing &s;en&s;ations, mon&s;ieur de Lovaine entered my apartment&mdash;The moment I beheld him, rage, for the fir&s;t time of my life, became the predominant pa&s;|&s;ion of my &s;oul. I accu&s;ed him as the author of all my wretchedne&s;s, would not &s;uffer him to &s;peak, though he was pro&s;trate at my feet, and commanded him to fly from my &s;ight for ever&mdash;Un|willing to irritate me farther, he ro&s;e and retired; and had there been an in&s;tru|ment of death within my reach, I fear I might at that in&s;tant have put an end to a wretched being, which &s;aw it&s;elf mark|ed out for de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I was at la&s;t informed by the marchi|one&s;s's orders, that a <HI>fiacre</HI> waited to car|ry me where I plea&s;ed.&mdash;Though I had
<PB N="16" REF="18">
been near ten months at Paris, I was as much a &s;tranger in that great city, as on the day I fir&s;t arrived there. I im|plored the &s;ervant who had attended Oli|via, not to for&s;ake me, and to direct whither I &s;hould go, and what cour&s;e I &s;hould take! She applied to her lady for leave to attend me, but &s;he had not hu|manity &s;ufficient to grant her reque&s;t.&mdash;The girl had, however, re&s;olution and compa&s;&s;ion enough to di&s;obey her com|mands, and accompanied me to a &s;mall hou&s;e in the &s;uburbs of St. Germains, that belonged to her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had brought me there, &s;he returned again to the hotel de Fribourg, without my knowledge, to pack up my cloaths, and her own&mdash;When &s;he came back, &s;he gave me a
<PB N="17" REF="19">
pocket book, which &s;he &s;aid I had left behind me; as &s;oon as I &s;aw it, I knew it was not mine, and de&s;ired &s;he would find the owner, and re&s;tore it&mdash;She open|ed it, and a letter dropped out, addre&s;|&s;ed to me&mdash;the hand appeared to be the marchione&s;s's, and it occurred to me that &s;he might have &s;o far relented, as to acquaint me with what &s;he knew of Co|lonel Walter&mdash;I in&s;tantly broke the &s;eal, and read as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Madame D'OLIVET.</HEAD>
<P>MADAM, if, as we are taught to believe, penitence may atone for the greate&s;t crimes, the true &s;orrow and con|trition which I feel for having rendered you unhappy, entitles me to hope for your forgivene&s;s&mdash;But though you &s;hould be generous enough to grant it, it is
<PB N="18" REF="20">
impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould ever forgive my&s;elf.&mdash;Do not be alarmed, madam, at the little artifice I have u&s;ed, in en|deavouring to counterfeit the marchi|one&s;s's hand; I mean nothing more by it, than to plead for pardon, and to &s;a|tisfy you that I &s;hall never more attempt to di&s;turb your peace.</P>
<P>The moment I have &s;ealed this, I &s;hall quit Paris, perhaps for ever&mdash;The &s;ight of my tyrant, is now become odious to me, and I dare not flatter my&s;elf with the happine&s;s of ever again beholding you. I go, then, Madam, to indulge my unhappy pa&s;&s;ion in &s;ilence, and re|tirement&mdash;I fly from the object of my hatred, to the contemplation of her whom I adore, of her to whom the warme&s;t wi&s;hes of my heart, &s;hall for

ever be devoted, and to whom I &s;hall for ever remain</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Enclo&s;ed in this letter there was a bank note, for two hundred louis d'ors, which I immediately &s;ealed up with it, and &s;ent Maria to deliver back into the hands of mon&s;ieur de Lovaine; but he had quitted the marchione&s;s's hou&s;e, an
<PB N="20" REF="22">
hour before that time, and no per&s;on could tell where he was gone to.</P>
<P>The violent agitation of &s;pirits I had gone through brought on a feveri&s;h complaint, and though I had re&s;olved to go, alas! I knew not where, in pur|&s;uit of Colonel Walter, I found my&s;elf unable to &s;it up, and was obliged to &s;ub|mit to my di&s;order&mdash;I grew wor&s;e every hour, and by the next morning I be|came delirious&mdash;The phy&s;ician who at|tended me, thought it was impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould recover, and at the end of &s;ix weeks, my being able to crawl acro&s;s the chamber was deemed a prodigy.</P>
<P>The anxiety of my mind, doubtle&s;s retarded my recovery; my impatience to &s;ee Colonel Walter, or at lea&s;t to hear
<PB N="21" REF="23">
&s;omething of him, increa&s;ed every day; and Maria's &s;i&s;ter was &s;ent to inquire for him, at all the hotels, and hou&s;es of Engli&s;h re&s;ort, in Paris, but without ever receiving the lea&s;t glimmering of light to trace him by.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my &s;trength would permit, I was carried in a &s;edan to the Luxem|burg gardens; Maria attended, that I might lean on her, in ca&s;e I &s;hould be able to walk.&mdash;I was moving &s;lowly on, in one of the mo&s;t retired walks, when I heard Colonel Walter's voice; I turn|ed quick to look for him, and &s;aw him coming towards me, with another gen|tleman&mdash;But I &s;aw no more, my &s;en&s;es for&s;ook me; in &s;pite of Maria's &s;u&s;|taining arm, I fell motionle&s;s on the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">The fir&s;t emotions of humanity natu|rally brought both the&s;e per&s;ons to my a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, the colonel rai&s;ed me in his arms, and carried me to the next &s;eat; but the moment he beheld my face, he &s;tarted from me, and cried out, Come away, my lord, and leave that abandoned wo|man to practi&s;e her arts on other men, for here they cannot be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>He then took hold of his companion, dragged him off, and quitted the gardens with the utmo&s;t precipitation&mdash;And though Maria had &s;en&s;e enough to know that this mu&s;t have been the per&s;on we had &s;o long been in &s;earch of, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to quit me, in the &s;itua|tion I then was, in order to pur&s;ue and watch his haunts.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">This la&s;t &s;hock quite overcame my &s;pirits; I was conveyed home in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, fell from one fainting fit into another, and for &s;everal weeks my exi&s;tence was marked only by the hourly expectation of my di&s;&s;olution&mdash;Yet was I at that time more anxious to live, than I had ever been before; I had &s;een my hu&s;band, and hoped there was a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of &s;eeing him again, of clearing my innocence, and at lea&s;t of placing my be|loved child under the protection of her father! The&s;e were &s;trong motives, and they operated accordingly&mdash;I recovered, to the amazement of every creature that knew me; and again vainly renewed my &s;earch after my unkind fugitive.</P>
<P>Maria u&s;ed &s;ometimes to vi&s;it a fa|vourite fellow-&s;ervant at the marchion|ne&s;s's,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
who told her it was univer&s;ally believed in the family, that I had had an amour with Mon&s;ieur de Lovaine; that he had entirely ab&s;ented him&s;elf from his lady; and that &s;he &s;eemed inclined to con&s;ole her&s;elf for his lo&s;s, by a particu|lar intimacy with an Engli&s;h gentleman, who made one in all her parties, and was going with her in a few days, to the waters of Barege&mdash;The de&s;cription &s;he gave of his per&s;on exactly re&s;embled Co|nel Walter, and I was perfectly convin|ced that this new friend of the marchi|one&s;s's was my &s;till beloved, deceived, and unkind hu&s;band!</P>
<P>I had no per&s;on to con&s;ult, who was capable of advi&s;ing me how I &s;hould act upon this occa&s;ion; and amid&s;t a variety of wild and romantic &s;chemes, I at la&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="27">
pitched on that of writing to him, and reque&s;ting the favour of an interview, in the character of a &s;tranger. I had no doubt that if he accepted my invitation, nature would recover her rights in his heart; and that the &s;ight of a woman whom he had once fondly loved, and cruelly de&s;erted, with the additional influence of his lovely child, would melt his obdurate nature, or at lea&s;t &s;often it &s;o far as to allow me to a&s;&s;ert my innocence, and endeavour to awaken the feelings of parental affection, if every other &s;pecies of tenderne&s;s were even totally extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e fond ideas, I wrote to him in an ambiguous &s;tile, di&s;gui&s;ed my hand as much as po&s;&s;ible, and would not even venture to direct my letter, le&s;t the recollection of my writing, which is ra|ther
<PB N="26" REF="28">
particular, &s;hould prevent his open|ing it.&mdash;Maria prevailed on her friend, who lived at the marchione&s;s's, to deliver this billet to his &s;ervant, and to de&s;ire that the an&s;wer might be left with her.</P>
<P>Every thing an&s;wered to my expec|tations, and, the morning follow|ing, I received a very galant note, a&s;|&s;uring me that the per&s;on I had honoured with my invitation, would mo&s;t gladly accept of the favour I intended him, and have the happine&s;s of waiting on me, at eight o'clock that evening.</P>
<P>My poor fooli&s;h heart exulted with joy, at the &s;ucce&s;s of my little &s;tratagem. I dre&s;&s;ed and undre&s;&s;ed Olivia, an hun|dred times, in order to try if I could add any ornament to her natural beauty, and
<PB N="27" REF="29">
render her more lovely in her father's eyes&mdash;as to my&s;elf I di&s;dained the aid of dre&s;s, well knowing that my wan com|plexion, and my wa&s;ted form, could only furni&s;h him with &s;uch a reproachful idea as my gho&s;t might have done, of what I was when he for&s;ook me.</P>
<P>I counted the minutes quicker than they pa&s;&s;ed, and thought them ages, till the appointed hour arrived&mdash;but, gracious Heaven! how &s;hall I expre&s;s the a&s;toni&s;hment I felt, when I &s;aw an utter &s;tranger enter the room, with a mixture of libertini&s;m and freedom, in his looks and manners; I let go Olivia's hand, which I had held in mine, gave a loud &s;hriek, and fainted.</P>
<P>Maria ran to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the &s;tran|ger gazed intently on me, and &s;aid to her,
<PB N="28" REF="30">
with a kind of &s;neer, it was a pity that her lady was &s;ubject to &s;uch violent di&s;|orders, but hoped &s;he would recover her health before &s;he made another a&s;&s;ig|nation with him; for he had &s;een her faint twice, and he did not think fits were the lea&s;t addition to female beauty&mdash;How|ever, as he believed &s;he might be in di&s;|tre&s;s, he would make her a pre&s;ent of five guineas, for the &s;ake of an old friend of her's, hone&s;t Jack Walter&mdash;and that when he came back from Barege, he would call upon her again, in hopes of finding her in a more &s;ociable &s;tate than &s;he appeared to be, at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Maria in&s;tantly recollected that this gentleman was with the Colonel, the day we met him in the Luxemburg gardens, and endeavoured to convince him, that

he was not the per&s;on I expected to &s;ee: he &s;aid that was impo&s;&s;ible, for he had my note in his pocket, and had &s;hewn it to Colonel Walter, who knew my writ|ing perfectly well, though I had at|tempted to di&s;gui&s;e it.&mdash;She tried every argument to make him take back his money, but in vain; and as he found that I did not immediately come to my|&s;elf, he quitted the hou&s;e, with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;&s;atisfaction at his di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P>This la&s;t &s;troke was infinitely more &s;evere than all that I had yet endured; I now &s;aw the impo&s;&s;ibility of ever clear|ing my conduct to my hu&s;band, and de|voted as I was, by him, to infamy, the peaceful a&s;ylum of the &s;heltering grave was now become my only hope, or wi&s;h;
<PB N="30" REF="32">
even a mother's tenderne&s;s could not re|concile me to &s;uch unmerited and end|le&s;s &s;ufferings; that virtuous fondne&s;s which had &s;u&s;tained me through all my former trials, was now ab&s;orbed in mean &s;elf-love, and I could not refrain from praying for an end of my mi&s;ery, though certain that my Olivia's misfortunes mu&s;t commence from the conclu&s;ion of mine.</P>
<P>I langui&s;hed on, for many months, in this &s;tate of pa&s;&s;ive de&s;pair, when the fight of the good father Guillaume, whom I had never heard from &s;ince I left Mar|&s;eilles, and of cour&s;e concluded to be dead, brought back a gleam of joy.</P>
<P>He told me that after his return to Mar&s;eilles, he had a long and &s;evere ill|ne&s;s, and on his recovery had been obliged
<PB N="31" REF="33">
to go to Rome, on bu&s;ine&s;s; that he had written to me, &s;everal times, and was grieved to find that his letters had mi&s;|carried.&mdash;He informed me, that Nan|nette had died, in about &s;ix weeks after I left her; that &s;he was extremely pe|nitent for the injuries &s;he had done me; and retracted every thing &s;he had &s;aid to my prejudice&mdash;I dropped tears at her untimely fate&mdash;while my own mi&s;ery taught me to envy that lot, which my humanity lamented.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s had written to fa|ther Guillaume, and accu&s;ed me of the ba&s;e&s;t ingratitude to her, and the mo&s;t infamous conduct with regard to my&s;elf; and the good man had come on purpo&s;e, to Paris, to be, as he &s;aid, convinced of my innocence, or to relinqui&s;h his opinion
<PB N="32" REF="34">
of female virtue. The &s;ituation he found me in, afforded him &s;ufficient conviction of my integrity; and when I related the circum&s;tances in which I had been in|volved, the gracious drops of pity that he &s;hed for my di&s;tre&s;s, were like a heal|ing balm to my poor wounded heart.</P>
<P>He would have gone directly to the marchione&s;s, and tried to undeceive her, but &s;he had been at Barege, for &s;ome time, and no one knew whether &s;he would go from thence to Paris, or Mar|&s;eilles.&mdash;He undertook to find out Co|lonel Walter for me, if he remained in Paris; and cheared my &s;pirits with the hope that he would at lea&s;t vindicate my injured character, and leave him no ex|cu&s;e for the inhumanity of his beha|viour.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">After a fruitle&s;s &s;earch of &s;everal weeks, he learned that Colonel Walter was then at Genoa&mdash;He wrote to him, in the mo&s;t forcible terms, in my favour; but to this, and many other letters, he never deigned an an&s;wer, though we were &s;atisfied that he had received them from the hand of a per&s;on that Father Guillaume could de|pend on; who afterwards informed us of the Colonel's &s;etting out for England, and of his de&s;ign of returning to &s;ettle in his native country.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I had now no hope left of ever recovering his e&s;teem, or my re|putation&mdash;To my great joy I perceived I was going fa&s;t into a con&s;umption; but though I longed for my relea&s;e, it was impo&s;&s;ible to quit my little charge ex|po&s;ed to all the mi&s;eries of unfriended

youth, without &s;uffering the &s;evere&s;t agonies; and after many con&s;ultations, upon the &s;ubject, I at la&s;t acquie&s;ced in Father Guillaume's opinion, that it was my duty not to leave her totally an or|phan, but to place her and my&s;elf under the protection of her father, before I &s;hould be taken from her.</P>
<P>Upon this principle I &s;et out for Ireland, as &s;oon as I had received information, through Father Guillaume's means, of my hu&s;band's being there. I arrived about four months ago: my reception &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed even my apprehen&s;ions! inhumani|ty and in&s;ult were added to unkindne&s;s, and my not being turned out to peri&s;h in the highway, was accounted a favour far beyond my de&s;ert.&mdash;What account the Colonel gave of me to his &s;ervants, I
<PB N="35" REF="37">
can only &s;uppo&s;e; but he told me that if ever I attempted to conver&s;e with one of them, I &s;hould not remain another mo|ment in his hou&s;e; he commanded me never again to appear in his &s;ight, and confined me to a wretched garret, where I am &s;upplied with &s;uch food as his &s;ervants think proper to afford me.</P>
<P>Unworthy as I am, I have often re|pined at the continuance of my exi&s;tence; but I now ble&s;s the cha&s;tening hand that has enabled me to &s;upport my mi&s;eries to this au&s;picious hour; when I can no longer doubt that my child &s;hall find pro|tection from your humanity, and no more be involved in the unhappy fate that has &s;o long attended her truly wretched mother!</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">The agonies which Mrs. Walter &s;u&s;|tained, during the recital of her affecting &s;tory, made me fear that her death would bring it to a period, before &s;he had fi|ni&s;hed the relation&mdash;But my appearing, as I really was, &s;incerely intere&s;ted in her misfortunes, &s;eemed to furni&s;h her with &s;uch a recruit of &s;trength and &s;pirits, as enabled her to undergo the reflection and recital of her unmerited &s;orrows.</P>
<P>The morning was pretty far advanced, by the time Mrs. Walter had concluded her narrative; I gave her the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of my doing every thing in my power, both for her&s;elf, and her child&mdash;I pre&s;&s;ed her to take &s;hare of my bed, for a few hours, which &s;he refu&s;ed, though &s;he &s;eemed &s;o faint and exhau&s;ted, as to be &s;carce able to get up &s;tairs.

if Olivia &s;hould awaken and mi&s;s her, &s;he would be alarmed, and might di&s;turb the family. She added that one of her greate&s;t anxieties, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, had been for what her child &s;hould feel, if &s;he &s;hould happen to expire in the night, and that the little helple&s;s innocent &s;hould find her cold and in&s;en&s;ible to her &s;oft touch and voice!</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he left me, I went to bed, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;t&mdash;I knew not in what manner to act; Sir Wil|liam would probably be di&s;plea&s;ed at my interfering in Colonel Walter's affairs, yet was I determined, at all events, to fulfil my promi&s;e to this amiable unfor|tunate, and protect her and her child, as far as it might be in my power!</P>

<P>In que&s;t of happine&s;s we &s;hould for ever ca&s;t our eyes downward, and the

tears that flow from them, in contem|plating the mi&s;eries of tho&s;e who are more wretched than our&s;elves, will at ela&s;t &s;tifle the voice of &s;elf-love, and &s;ilence the complaints that ari&s;e from le&s;&s;er &s;or|rows&mdash;&s;ometimes imaginary ones.</P>
<P>When I compare my &s;ufferings with tho&s;e of the unfortunate Olivia, I am &s;hocked at my own ingratitude and im|piety, for having ever dared to &s;ay I was unhappy! The greate&s;t mi&s;ery I have en|dured, falls infinitely &s;hort of the lea&s;t of hers.&mdash;</P>
<P>Like her, I have been for&s;aken by the man I love; but then I have not, like her, been expo&s;ed to want and ignominy. Sheltered in the fo&s;tering arms of tender and affectionate friends, who &s;ympathize
<PB N="41" REF="43">
even with my weakne&s;s in lamenting an incon&s;tant lover, ble&s;&s;ed with reputation, health, and fortune&mdash;the&s;e circum&s;tances render the compari&s;on &s;o very unfair, that it mu&s;t be di&s;advantageous to make it.

<P>But where is &s;he, now, Loui&s;a? It is not po&s;&s;ible that you can have left her in that Pandaemonium, which the great fiend inhabits! I cannot &s;peak of Colonel Walter in milder terms. I am provoked that the infernal &s;hould have any &s;hadow of pretence, for his barbarity to his angelic wife.&mdash;When the world once gets hold of a tale of &s;candal, is it not ea&s;y
<PB N="42" REF="44">
to wre&s;t it from them.&mdash;That wicked marchione&s;s&mdash;but there will be no end to my letter, if I go on entering into par|ticulars.</P>
<P>All I can &s;ay upon the whole, is this, that I fear your bringing her to South|field may engage Sir William in a &s;trife, either with the Colonel, or your&s;elf: no one can tell which part; he will take, I &s;hould rather apprehend his &s;iding with the mon&s;ter, and quarrelling with you for intermeddling.</P>
<P>To avoid all this apprehen&s;ion, if Mrs. Walter be able to bear the journey, on the ea&s;ie&s;t terms it can be made to her, reque&s;t you to &s;end her and her child over to me, as quick as po&s;&s;ible. I will receive her with open arms, and do

every thing in my power to procure her health, and peace: I have no per&s;on to whom I am accountable for my conduct, and therefore &s;tand clearer from diffi|culty in this affair than you do.</P>
<P>I hope the&s;e rea&s;ons will incline both Mrs. Walter and you to comply with my entreaty, and that I &s;hall &s;oon have the happine&s;s of embracing the two lovely Olivias.&mdash;She may depend on my &s;ecrecy: I can prepare this family, in half an hour, for the reception of a lady and her daughter from France, whom I have invited to &s;pend &s;ome time with me; I will carry her to Bri&s;tol, or any other place that may aid her recovery&mdash;She mu&s;t not die Loui&s;a; and, for Heaven's &s;ake, let me have the happi|ne&s;s of being concerned in her pre&s;erva|tion.</P>

<P>I have this moment received a letter from our dear brother, that has amazed me.&mdash;What think you is the pretended reque&s;t of the dying Delia? Why no|thing more, than that Sir George &s;hould marry her mother! I have long &s;u&s;pected her pa&s;&s;ion for my brother; I knew her to be an artful, that is, in other words,

a vile woman! I cannot help the evil thoughts which obtrude them&s;elves on my mind, with regard to my dear De|lia's death&mdash;If Mrs. Colville be innocent, Heaven forgive me!&mdash;But I have not charity enough to pray for her, if &s;he &s;hould be guilty.</P>
<P>Sir George does not expre&s;s half the horror that I feel at this &s;hocking pro|po&s;al! the gratification which our va|nity receives in knowing we are beloved, even by the mo&s;t worthle&s;s per&s;on, can, I perceive, &s;often our contempt into compa&s;&s;ion, and deceive us &s;o far as to make us think &s;uch pity the offspring of our virtue&mdash;However, do not be alarmed; for though he &s;peaks &s;omewhat too ten|derly of her pretended &s;orrow, I am cer|tain no power on earth could ever make

<OPENER><DATELINE>Southfield.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS letter, my Fanny, &s;hall go on in the narrative &s;tile, at lea&s;t &s;o far as it relates to Mrs. Walter; for as her adventures are intirely detached from any thing relative to us, I will not min|gle them with mine.</P>
<P>I lay till it was very late, on the morning that the fair unfortunate had re|lated her &s;tory, yet I had neither &s;lept, nor fixed upon any &s;cheme for deliver|ing her from her hated pri&s;on, except that of bringing her and her child to Southfield, which I fore&s;aw mu&s;t be at|tended with very hazardous con&s;equen|ces;
<PB N="48" REF="50">
I therefore &s;ummoned a little coun|cil, the moment I aro&s;e, and after com|municating the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful circum|&s;tances of her &s;ituation to Lucy, Har|riet, and my faithful Ben&s;on, I de&s;ired them to give me their advice how to act, on this critical occa&s;ion; having fir&s;t informed them, that I was determined not to de&s;ert the cau&s;e I had undertaken, by leaving this amiable woman to peri&s;h at Walter&s;burgh.</P>
<P>Various, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, were the plans offered and rejected&mdash;It was at la&s;t agreed, that we &s;hould return home as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and that Mrs. Wal|ter &s;hould remain where &s;he was, for three or four days after our departure; that, in that time, Ben&s;on &s;hould be em|ployed in fitting up a chamber for her
<PB N="49" REF="51">
reception in the hou&s;e of one of our tenants, whom I formerly mention|ed to you, as having his hou&s;e burned, and who had now got a very comfort|able, though &s;mall, habitation, within a &s;hort walk of Southfield; that as &s;oon as every thing was prepared, Ben&s;on &s;hould come for her in my chai&s;e, to a particu|lar &s;pot, at a time appointed, and con|vey her and the little Olivia to this hou&s;e, where &s;he was to remain in pro|found &s;ecrecy, till we &s;aw what effect this innocent elopement might produce, till every thing in our power &s;hould have been done for the recovery of her health, and till we could fix upon &s;ome more eli|gible plan for her future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>As the Colonel's &s;ervants gave them|&s;elves not the lea&s;t trouble about the fair
<PB N="50" REF="52">
reclu&s;e, we found it very ea&s;y to convey proper food to her, unob&s;erved; and as I thought it right that &s;he &s;hould have time to con&s;ider of our &s;cheme, I wrote to her directly, and de&s;ired to have the plea&s;ure of another interview with her, in my apartment, that night.&mdash;I gave her to under&s;tand, in the polite&s;t man|ner I could, my rea&s;ons for declining to bring her directly to Southfield, at lea&s;t till I had con&s;ulted my hu&s;band; and a&s;|&s;ured her in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that while I lived, neither &s;he, or her child, &s;hould ever be reduced to the mi&s;ery of &s;eeking &s;upport or protection from the inhuman Colonel Walter. I added every thing that I thought could &s;oothe her mind, and implored her to take care of her health, for the &s;ake of her lovely in|fant.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">She replied almo&s;t in&s;tantly to my let|ter, poured forth the warme&s;t acknow|ledgments for my goodne&s;s, again call|ed me her guardian angel, and &s;aid &s;he was ready to be guided by me in every thing; and that, as the &s;tronge&s;t mark of her gratitude, &s;he would at my com|mand endeavour to live, were it only to ble&s;s and thank me!</P>
<P>The impatience of Lucy and Harriet to &s;ee Mrs. Walter was extreme; they looked at their watches an hundred times, and would fain have per&s;uaded them&s;elves they did not, go from the mo|ment it grew du&s;k till our hour of retir|ing; though it was yet a moot point, whether they were to &s;ee her or no, as I meant fir&s;t to a&s;k her permi&s;&s;ion, cer|tainly, before I &s;hould pre&s;ent them to her.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">When &s;he entered my apartment, her countenance &s;eemed at once more animat|ed and compo&s;ed than it had been the preceding night&mdash;the effu&s;ions of her gratitude were &s;uch as mu&s;t flow from a heart like hers, and were more fully expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ilent eloquence of tears, than by the pomp of words&mdash;She rea|dily and mo&s;t gracefully complied with the reque&s;t I made her, of giving me leave to introduce Lucy and Harriet to her; who, notwith&s;tanding the de&s;crip|tion I had given them of the delicacy and elegance of her form, were both amazed when they beheld her, and could hardly con&s;ider her as of fle&s;h and blood, but rather a form of un&s;ub&s;tantial air, or el&s;e compo&s;ed of that fine ether with which we &s;uppo&s;e angels indue them&s;elves, when they deign to become vi&s;ible on earth.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">As both Mrs. Walter and I wanted re&s;t, we parted &s;ooner than we had done the foregoing night, after having fir&s;t &s;ettled every thing for the execution of our project, and fixed on the day follow|ing for my quitting Walter&s;burg. Ben|&s;on packed up a part of hers and Olivia's cloaths with mine, and we contrived to leave her every little nece&s;&s;ary that could be conducive to her comfort or conveni|ence, while &s;he remained behind us.</P>
<P>I have now the plea&s;ure to tell you that every thing &s;ucceeded to our wi&s;hes, and that &s;he and her &s;weet girl are &s;afely and privately lodged at ho|ne&s;t farmer Wil&s;on's, for the pre&s;ent. I write to her every day by Ben&s;on, but have not yet ventured to &s;ee her, as I am not able to walk, and the eclat of my
<PB N="54" REF="56">
carriage &s;topping at a farm-hou&s;e, might occa&s;ion &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Ben&s;on a&s;&s;ures me that &s;he already per|ceives a change for the better in her ap|pearance; and I begin to hope &s;he may recover both her health and peace of mind. The little Olivia is quite wild with &s;pirits, and is trying to learn Eng|li&s;h from Lucy, who vi&s;its Mrs. Wal|ter every day, and the fir&s;t words &s;he de|&s;ired to be taught, were meant to ex|pre&s;s her thanks to me for my kindne&s;s to her mamma.</P>
<P>Though I reflect with &s;incere plea&s;ure on having been able to re&s;cue this ami|able woman from a &s;cene of the &s;evere&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, yet I cannot help feeling an anxiety for her future fate, which gives
<PB N="55" REF="57">
me extreme pain&mdash;She cannot long re|main where &s;he is, undi&s;covered, and no one can tell what &s;tep that barbarian, her hu&s;band, may take to di&s;tre&s;s her yet far|ther&mdash;My apprehen&s;ions are, that he will force Olivia from her; and the lo&s;s of her child would, I am certain, occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of her life.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing that he &s;hould never di&s;cover her retreat, or even inquire about her, I &s;ee no a&s;ylum, except a con|vent, where her youth and beauty will not &s;ubject her to a thou&s;and misfor|tunes.&mdash;You are &s;ufficiently acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ith my &s;entiments on the &s;ubject of mo|na&s;teries, to know how very unwilling I &s;hould be to recommend a &s;tate of &s;e|clu&s;ion to any creature I either love or e&s;teem; yet, in her unhappy &s;ituation,
<PB N="56" REF="58">
I &s;ee no other re&s;ource&mdash;However, I &s;hall not advi&s;e precipitately.</P>
<P>Not but that I &s;hould approve ex|tremely of an e&s;tabli&s;hment of this kind, in our own country, under our own re|ligion and laws; both equally free from tyranny&mdash;An a&s;ylum for unhappy wo|men to retreat to&mdash;not from the world, but from the misfortunes, or the &s;lander of it&mdash;for female orphans, young wi|dows, or &s;till more unhappy objects, for|&s;aken, or ill treated wives, to betake them&s;elves to, in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es. For in all the&s;e circum&s;tances, women who live alone, have need of &s;omething more than either prudence or a fair character, to guard them from rudene&s;s or cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Now &s;ome &s;ort of foundation, under the government of a re&s;pectable matron|age,
<PB N="57" REF="59">
endowed for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, would certainly be an in&s;titution mo&s;t devout|ly to be wi&s;hed for, as a relief in the dif|ficulties of tho&s;e &s;ituations I have ju&s;t mentioned.

<P>I have had a letter from Sir William, and for once he &s;eems plea&s;ed with my determination of &s;taying in the country. This has made me very happy&mdash;tho' had he commanded my attendance in Dub|lin, I would have obeyed; for I will at lea&s;t endeavour to de&s;erve the character

which the offended Moor gives of the gentle De&s;demona&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As you &s;ay, obe|dient,&mdash;very obedient!"</Q>&mdash;and, as I have already told my Fanny, that is all that I can at pre&s;ent promi&s;e.</P>
<P>I think it is a little century &s;ince I have heard from you; I &s;uppo&s;e you did not chu&s;e to interrupt me in my narrative, but I expect, and I think rea&s;onably, that you &s;hould now hold forth, in your turn, and allow me credit for the enter|tainment which I am certain you mu&s;t have received, from Mrs. Walter's &s;tory.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lady BARTON to Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</HEAD>
<P>I Have &s;uch a variety of &s;ubjects to treat of, that I know not which to be|gin with; but I think I ought to pay my dear Fanny the compliment of attending fir&s;t to her long wi&s;hed-for and truly welcome letter.</P>
<P>I had not a doubt but that your huma|nity would be both affected and intere&s;ted for the unhappy Mrs. Walter. The good|ne&s;s both of your head and heart is eminently con&s;picious in the proper u&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="63">
you have made of her misfortunes. To lighten and invalidate our own &s;ufferings, by comparing them with tho&s;e of others, is truly philo&s;ophic: but that firmne&s;s of mind, or rather toughne&s;s of heart, which enables us to bear our own mi&s;eries with patience and compo&s;ure, is, in general, but too apt to render us callous to tho&s;e tender feelings, which &s;hould be excited by the woes of others.&mdash;Let me then con|gratulate my&s;elf on having a &s;i&s;ter who&s;e Stoici&s;m is confined only to her&s;elf, while her tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion are ex|tended to the numerous, the unbounded circle of the unhappy!</P>
<P>Yes, my Fanny, your reque&s;t &s;hall be complied with; Mrs. Walter is al|ready made happy in the hope of being known to &s;uch a generous mind as yours.
<PB N="62" REF="64">
She has confe&s;&s;ed to me, that, in her pre|&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;he had &s;uffered a thou&s;and apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t my kindne&s;s to her might involve me in difficulties with Sir William; but that &s;he could think of no expedient to prevent this evil, but flying to a convent, which &s;he feared to pro|po&s;e, as her going there mu&s;t be attended with what &s;he thought too con&s;iderable an expence.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have &s;trongly objected to this &s;cheme, from her ill &s;tate of health, though &s;he is, however, amazingly recovered, &s;ince her enlargement from that wor&s;e than pri&s;on, where her poor mind was fettered, though her limbs were free&mdash;And I have great hopes, from the calm &s;tate in which &s;he now appears, of her recovery.&mdash;She has really an extraordi|nary
<PB N="63" REF="65">
under&s;tanding, allowing for her youth and inexperience; and from that, I tru&s;t, that &s;he will be able to conquer the tenderne&s;s &s;he formerly felt for the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of his &s;ex.</P>
<P>She is to &s;et out this night for Corke, where &s;he is con&s;igned to the care of an eminent merchant, a particular friend of Lucy Lei&s;ter's, who will en&s;ure her a pa&s;&s;age in one of the be&s;t &s;hips that &s;ails from thence to Bri&s;tol.&mdash;On her ar|rival there, &s;he is to be put into the care of Ben&s;on's niece, who is married to a &s;tationer, and is commanded by her aunt to attend her up to London, and lodge her &s;afe under your kind protection. One of farmer Wil&s;on's daughters goes with her, to attend the little Olivia&mdash;The girl has lived in &s;ome creditable families,
<PB N="64" REF="66">
and is tolerably clever&mdash;Both Mrs. Wal|ter and her lovely child have made an a&s;toni&s;hing progre&s;s in learning Engli&s;h; they have capacities for every thing.</P>
<P>When the moment arrives of bidding her adieu, which it &s;hortly mu&s;t, I &s;hall be &s;en&s;ible of a more mixed &s;en&s;ation than I have ever felt before; I know that I ought to rejoice at our &s;eparation, for her &s;ake; but I cannot help being &s;elfi&s;h enough to regret it, for my own.</P>
<P>Amazement falls infinitely &s;hort of what I felt, when I read the paragraph in your letter relative to Mrs. Colville! I am &s;hocked as well as you at the train of ideas which obtruded them&s;elves upon me, in con&s;equence of her unnatural pro|po&s;al&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alarmed about my brother!"</Q>
<PB N="65" REF="67">
No, Heaven forbid that I &s;hould ever think of him in &s;uch a light! He ever di&s;liked, and he mu&s;t now dete&s;t her&mdash;But Sir George is of a mild and gentle nature, not apt to give the reins to his re&s;entments; his natural and acquired good breeding mu&s;t prevent his &s;peak|ing hardly of a woman who even pretends to love him; and the involuntary re&s;pect with which he is in&s;pired for Delia's mo|ther, mu&s;t increa&s;e his re&s;traint, and &s;i|lence every &s;arca&s;tical reflection.</P>
<P>Now for my&s;elf&mdash;I know not what to think about Lord Lucan; never was confu&s;ion equal to mine, at &s;eeing him&mdash;this rendered me incapable of ob&s;erving him; but Lucy, who was pre&s;ent at our interview, a&s;&s;ured me there was nothing particular in his appearance, except the
<PB N="66" REF="68">
palene&s;s of his countenance, and his &s;ur|pri&s;e at my manner, which I am &s;ure mu&s;t have been perfectly <HI>di&s;trait.</HI></P>
<P>Why did he bring Mi&s;s A&s;hford here? She doubtle&s;s remarked the alteration in my behaviour; and I am perhaps, at this moment, the object of their ridicule.&mdash;I never &s;aw her look &s;o hand&s;ome as &s;he did that evening&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e they will &s;oon be married: I wi&s;h it was over, and that they were both gone to his &s;eat in the North.</P>
<P>I have been extremely unea&s;y, the&s;e three days, about my little Harriet&mdash;&s;he looks ill, and neither eats, or &s;leeps, yet will not allow that &s;he is &s;ick. I &s;hould certainly apprehend her being in love, if &s;he had &s;een any object lately, that could have in&s;pired her with that pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">No, my dear Fanny! my adventure at Walter&s;burgh was not a dream; yet I &s;ometimes think with you, that Lord Lucan could never have been guilty of &s;uch an indecorum; tho' I do not now agree with you, that he is at all affected with any particular &s;entiment towards me. And I &s;incerely rejoice in di&s;&s;enting from your opinion, on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>By &s;ending Mrs. Walter to you, I have barred my own hopes of &s;eeing you in Ireland; and I, alas! have none of meet|ing you, in England&mdash;I cannot let this effort of genero&s;ity pa&s;s, without marking it, for perhaps it is the highe&s;t exertion of that virtue which I may ever have an opportunity of di&s;playing.</P>
<P>I go now to bid adieu to your future charge&mdash;She will have the happine&s;s of
<PB N="68" REF="70">
&s;eeing my Fanny, almo&s;t as &s;oon as this can reach her hands.&mdash;An involuntary &s;igh has ju&s;t e&s;caped me! Down, &s;elfi&s;h thoughts!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mi&s;s CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON.</HEAD>
<P>I Have received your letter, my Lou|i&s;a, and I have al&s;o received your fair, your lovely friend! Mrs. Walter arrived in Dover-&s;treet la&s;t night&mdash;Prepared as I was, by your de&s;cription, the extreme delicacy of her form &s;urpa&s;&s;ed my im|agination&mdash;I can &s;carcely per&s;uade my|&s;elf that &s;he is compounded of the &s;ame materials of which common mortals are made; at lea&s;t I am certain that there
<PB N="69" REF="71">
mu&s;t be as much difference, as there is between the clay of which the fine&s;t por|celain is formed, and that which makes the coar&s;e&s;t earthen-ware.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ay the &s;imile is &s;trength|ened by an appearance of extreme fragi|lity and weakne&s;s, which alarms one's tenderne&s;s into a kind of apprehen&s;ion for her &s;afety, every moment; and is, in my mind infinitely more intere&s;ting, than the mo&s;t healthful glow of beauty in its highe&s;t bloom&mdash;I am &s;ure if I were a man, I &s;hould be in love with her, and of cour&s;e mi&s;erable, for I could not help con&s;idering her but as a mere beauteous &s;hadow, which arough bla&s;t too quickly might di&s;&s;olve&mdash;But though not a lover, I am determined to cheri&s;h this <HI>fair idea,</HI> and for that purpo&s;e I &s;hall take lodg|ings
<PB N="70" REF="72">
at Ken&s;ington Gravel-pits, tomorrow, for three weeks, or a month; as I do not think the &s;ea&s;on far enough advan|ced, to carry her to the Hot-wells, or venture her even &s;o far as Cleveland-hall.</P>
<P>There is, as you have already ob&s;erv|ed, &s;omething uncommonly engaging in her manner of &s;peaking; but her &s;enti|ments need no addition&mdash;I never heard &s;uch warm, yet elegant expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, as &s;he u&s;ed in &s;peaking of you; her tears flowed fa&s;t while &s;he uttered them. The little Olivia took her hand, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mamma, Lady Barton is &s;o good, that I know it would grieve her to think &s;he made you weep; for I am &s;ure &s;he meant to dry your tears."</Q></P>
<P>But Mrs. Walter is at this moment writing to you, I will therefore leave her
<PB N="71" REF="73">
to expre&s;s her own &s;entiments, which &s;he will do much better than I can, becau&s;e &s;he feels more.</P>
<P>I am charmed with your &s;cheme of an Engli&s;h prote&s;tant mona&s;tery, though I am much afraid that both you wrote, and I read, that pa&s;&s;age in your letter, with too &s;elfi&s;h feelings and reflections. The general idea of convents I am as much aver&s;e to as you are; and I am &s;ure that none of tho&s;e abroad, would be a proper retreat for our fair client&mdash;The &s;trictne&s;s of their in&s;titutions, and the har&s;hne&s;s of their di&s;cipline, would &s;oon di&s;patch her to the region of &s;aints. Be|&s;ides, &s;uch a place would be as unfit for one in her &s;tate of mind, as well as of bo|dy&mdash;Need the already unhappy afflict them&s;elves &s;till further, with au&s;terities?</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">There is a paragraph in your letter, which gives me infinite concern: my dear Loui&s;a mu&s;t no longer boa&s;t a heart quite free from love&mdash;She is, I am afraid, a &s;tricken deer; but I will hope that the wound is not mortal, and that it may yet be healed, though not with|out a cicatrice.&mdash;Why!&mdash;A&s;k your&s;elf, my &s;i&s;ter, why all the&s;e apprehen&s;ions about Mi&s;s A&s;hford? Why is &s;he to be married to Lord Lucan, merely becau&s;e &s;he came with him to vi&s;it you? And why &s;hould you &s;u&s;pect an amiable young woman of &s;uch mean malice, as, without provocation, to attempt to render you ridiculous?&mdash;The&s;e are not the genu|ine feelings of my Loui&s;a's heart! the &s;tings of jealou&s;y have in&s;tilled its ve|nom, and this pa&s;&s;ion has but two &s;ources, pride and love.</P>

<P>I cannot help trembling for your hap|pine&s;s, Loui&s;a&mdash;I well know that I have nothing el&s;e to fear for; but is not that &s;ufficient! I have, with pain, long beheld your growing partiality for his lord&s;hip; yet I hoped, again&s;t the conviction of my own heart, which &s;till overflows with tenderne&s;s for an unworthy object, that you would be able to conquer it&mdash;But let me here ob&s;erve, Loui&s;a, that our &s;ituations are &s;o widely different, that the weakne&s;s which may in mine, not
<PB N="74" REF="76">
only be pardoned, but pitied, becomes criminal in yours.</P>
<P>This you may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay, is hard mea&s;ure; but as we were none of us in a condition to make terms for our&s;elves, before we came into the world, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to tho&s;e that this &s;ame world has impo&s;ed on us &s;ince; and believe me, that they who &s;truggle lea&s;t again&s;t tho&s;e chains which cu&s;tom has forged for our &s;ex are lea&s;t likely to feel their weight.&mdash;The world is jealous of its rites; it haughtily re&s;ents, and har&s;hly cha&s;tizes, the &s;malle&s;t breach of them; nor did I ever know a man or woman, who boa&s;t|ed that they de&s;pi&s;ed its laws, and tru&s;t|ed to their own integrity, who were not &s;oon &s;everely puni&s;hed by its contempt or cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">So much by way of cen&s;or; now let the friend and &s;i&s;ter plead for the pre&s;er|vation of your peace, which cannot be maintained with lo&s;s of fame, though con&s;cious innocence might plead your ju&s;tification ever &s;o &s;trongly&mdash;Should your character happen to be impeach|ed, from any mi&s;conduct of yours, remember that your hu&s;band has a right to re&s;ent your having forfeited the high|e&s;t tru&s;t which manly confidence can commit to female delicacy, the pre&s;er|vation both of his honour and her own! and that from that moment you mu&s;t appear in the light of a criminal, towards him at lea&s;t, tho' you &s;tand ever &s;o clear, with regard to your&s;elf. How truly hu|miliating mu&s;t &s;uch a &s;ituation be, to a mind like yours!</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">I have drawn this &s;ad pro&s;pect in the &s;tronge&s;t colours, in hopes that my Loui|&s;a will &s;tart from the brink of the pre|cipice where &s;he now &s;tands, and in|&s;tantly retreat into the gentle path of do|me&s;tic happine&s;s.&mdash;I am truly grieved that the roughne&s;s of Sir William's man|ners may render this walk le&s;s &s;mooth and plea&s;ing than it &s;hould be; yet &s;ure|ly it is ea&s;ier to tread on pebbles than on thorns! And with the latter we &s;hall cer|tainly find tho&s;e ways &s;trewed, that lead from the road which Providence has marked out for us.</P>
<P>I &s;hould dete&s;t my&s;elf if I were able to add another line on this &s;ubject, yet I hope that my tears have not &s;o much blotted what I have already written, as to prevent your reading it.</P>

<P>YES, Fanny, I confe&s;s it! you have &s;earched my bo&s;om, and found the arrow rankling in my heart! Too cruel &s;i&s;|ter! better, &s;ure far better, that you had re|mained ignorant of my di&s;ea&s;e, unle&s;s you can pre&s;cribe a cure! I now dete&s;t my&s;elf; and all that generous confidence, which is the true re&s;ult and firm &s;upport of real vir|tue, is for ever fled! I &s;hrink even from the mild eye of friend&s;hip&mdash;The tender, the affectionate looks of Harriet and Lu|cy, now di&s;tre&s;s me! How then &s;hall I endure the &s;tern expre&s;&s;ion of contempt and rage, from an offended hu&s;band's angry brow! There is but one thing
<PB N="93" REF="95">
that could be more dreadful&mdash;I mean his kindne&s;s&mdash;That alone could add new horrors to my wretched &s;tate, and make me feel the humiliating &s;ituation of a criminal &s;till more than I now do.</P>
<P>I am, I am a criminal! Alas! you know not to what degree I am &s;o! But I will tell you all, lay bare my heart be|fore you, and beg you not to &s;oothe, but probe its wounds.</P>
<P>At about a quarter of a mile from our hou&s;e, there is an octagon temple, which overlooks a fine piece of water, adjoining to which there is a beautiful and exten&s;ive wood; this room then, I have fitted up in a very elegant ta&s;te, as a &s;mall library, or mu&s;eum, for my&s;elf, and it is intirely devoted to my hours of
<PB N="94" REF="96">
retirement&mdash;Here I read, write, draw, or ruminate. In this &s;pot, on the day after I la&s;t wrote to you, was I &s;itting and mu|&s;ing, I will confe&s;s it, on the happine&s;s which might have been my portion, had I happened to have met Lord Lucan be|fore I was Sir William Barton's wife.</P>
<P>The tears &s;treamed in&s;en&s;ibly from my eyes, and &s;o much dimmed my &s;ight, as to make it doubtful whether the figure I then &s;aw of Lord Lucan, walking by the canal, was real, or vi&s;ionary&mdash;I ro&s;e immeditaely to the window, and per|ceived it to be him.</P>
<P>He came &s;lowly on, gazing intently on a miniature picture, which he &s;ome|times pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, and &s;ometimes held at a di&s;tance, as if to place it in dif|ferent
<PB N="95" REF="97">
points of view. Blu&s;hing, I own it, Fanny, I felt the pangs of jealou&s;y; I doubted not but it was Mi&s;s A&s;hford's picture, and in&s;tantly dete&s;ted the origi|ginal&mdash;How unworthy, how unju&s;t, do I now appear, in my own &s;ight!</P>
<P>My feet became as much rivetted to the place where I &s;tood, as Lord Lu|can's eyes were to the picture&mdash;He &s;aw me not, till he came clo&s;e to the window, and then, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, &s;lipt the portrait into his pocket.</P>
<P>He came into the temple, covered with blu&s;hes, made a thou&s;and apologies for having intruded upon my retirement, though he &s;aid he had come on purpo&s;e to take his leave, as he meant to quit Sir Arthur A&s;hford's, and &s;et out for his own &s;eat, the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">With more pique than prudence, I told him that I was &s;urpri&s;ed at his hav|ing re&s;olution &s;ufficient to tear him&s;elf from a per&s;on, who&s;e picture was &s;o dear to him as I &s;uppo&s;ed that to be, to which I had &s;een him pay his adorations, when I fancied he might have the ori|ginal as a companion for life, if he cho&s;e it.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw &s;urpri&s;e &s;o &s;trongly paint|ed, as in his countenance&mdash;His voice faltered while he replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Were that po&s;&s;ible, madam, I &s;hould be the hap|pie&s;t man alive&mdash;But, alas! there is a bar, an in&s;uperable bar, which cannot be &s;urmounted! therefore, madam, do I tear my&s;elf from the too lovely object of a de&s;pairing pa&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99">I was very near as much confu&s;ed as Lord Lucan, and, without knowing what I &s;aid, replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I pity you, my Lord, and am truly &s;orry."</Q>&mdash;At that in&s;tant, he in an extacy, exclaimed, O &s;top! mo&s;t honoured! mo&s;t beloved of women! nor rai&s;e my tran&s;ports to that dangerous height, which may exceed to madne&s;s! yet, yet again repeat the charming &s;ound! and by your pity overpay my &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for any one, not quite an idiot, to mi&s;under&s;tand this declar|ation&mdash;Yet was I ab&s;urd enough to &s;eem ignorant of his meaning, and an&s;wered that I did not conceive of what u&s;e my pity could be to him, as I could not hope to have more influence on Mi&s;s A&s;hford, than him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">He &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and, with a look that &s;eemed to pierce through all my little artifice, cried out <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mi&s;s A&s;h|ford, Madam! how is it her concern? Surely, my Lord, I replied, I thought it was that Lady's picture, with which you &s;eemed &s;o much delighted, as you walked along."</Q></P>
<P>He gazed on me again with earne&s;t|ne&s;s, as he would read my thoughts, and then with downca&s;t looks, as &s;peaking to him&s;elf, he &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It mu&s;t be &s;o! that form, that angel form, cannot deceive, and my temerity is yet a &s;ecret&mdash;It &s;hall remain &s;o; for I will fly, for ever, from her &s;ight."</Q></P>
<P>He turned away his face, to hide his tears; and had I &s;uffered our conver&s;ation to have ended there, I had been far le&s;s
<PB N="99" REF="101">
guilty than I am.&mdash;But vanity, that bane of female virtue, led me on, to tell him that I could not be &s;atisfied, without a farther explanation on this &s;ubject; and that, as he had declared Mi&s;s A&s;hford was not the object of his pa&s;&s;ion, I hoped he could have no objection to &s;hewing me the picture of a per&s;on, whom, in all probability, I neither did, nor po&s;&s;ibly might ever know.</P>
<P>He looked at me then, with a counte|nance more &s;olemn than I had ever &s;een him wear: I blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own in&s;incerity; he &s;aw into my thoughts, and, with a firm, and yet affecting manner, &s;poke thus.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Do not, for your own &s;ake, Madam, extend the cruelty of your triumph be|yond
<PB N="100" REF="102">
my demerits, nor wantonly &s;port with the mi&s;eries of one, whom yon have, though innocently, rendered wretched. Nature formed you in her mo&s;t perfect model, and gave me &s;u&s;ceptibility to ad|mire tho&s;e charms, which, to my endle&s;s grief, were then devoted to another.&mdash;I &s;ought, not Madam, to invade his right, or &s;oil the purity of your fair bo&s;om, with one improper thought. Your friend|&s;hip, your e&s;teem, I wi&s;hed to gain; and for that purpo&s;e kept my love concealed. Chance only has revealed it&mdash;How am I to blame? or wherefore &s;hould I now become the object of your hatred, or contempt? Your pity was the &s;ole indul|gence I ever &s;hould have dared to have &s;olicited and that you might, without a crime, have be&s;towed. The wildne&s;s of my pa&s;&s;ion flattered my fond hopes that you
<PB N="101" REF="103">
had ju&s;t now granted it&mdash;Judge of its value by my tran&s;ports, Madam&mdash;But you recal the precious gift; and all that I now dare pre&s;ume to a&s;k, is your for|givene&s;s; allow me that, and never more &s;hall the unhappy Lucan offend your eyes, or fea&s;t his own, with gazing on your charms."</Q></P>
<P>Tears &s;topped his utterance&mdash;O, Fan|ny! was it po&s;&s;ible that my eyes &s;hould be dry? they &s;treamed too &s;urely&mdash;I con|fe&s;s my weakne&s;s&mdash;At that moment my heart fir&s;t felt the luxury of tears&mdash;The &s;oft effu&s;ion flowed from pity, from ten|derne&s;s, from&mdash;dare I pronounce it, love!</P>
<P>The emotion he di&s;covered at &s;eeing me weep, was quite extravagant&mdash;He
<PB N="102" REF="104">
threw him&s;elf at my feet, &s;natched my hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, and vowed he would never ri&s;e till I pro|nounced his pardon. At that in&s;tant, I heard the &s;ound of voices that ap|proached us, and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ri&s;e, my Lord, I pardon, and I pity you."</Q></P>
<P>He had &s;carce time to obey me, before Colonel Walter, Lucy, and Harriet en|tered the temple&mdash;The apparent con|fu&s;ion, both of Lord Lucan's looks, and mine, with the tears that &s;till trembled in our eyes, was but too vi&s;ible to pa&s;s unnoticed; Lucy appeared &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ight of Lord Lucan, Harriet's face was covered with blu&s;hes, and the Co|lonel, by a malignant &s;mile, &s;hewed that he enjoyed our di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105">He pre&s;ented me with a letrer from Sir William, whom he had left in Dublin, and &s;aid he hoped that would plead his excu&s;e, for having interrupted what he thought the mo&s;t agreeable party in the world, a &s;entimental <HI>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</HI>; and turning bri&s;kly to Lord Lucan, a&s;ked him if he had been relating the melancholy &s;tory of Eloi&s;e and Abelard, or the more di&s;|a&s;trous loves of Hero and Leander?</P>
<P>Pique now got the better of my con|fu&s;ion, and, without waiting for Lord Lucan's reply, I an&s;wered, that we need not go &s;o far back, for melancholy tales; for that I was acquainted with &s;ome per|&s;ons now living, who&s;e &s;ufferings far exceeded tho&s;e of the unfortunate ladies he had mentioned. He turned his pier|cing eyes quick upon me, at the&s;e words,
<PB N="104" REF="106">
and for the fir&s;t time of his life, I be|lieve, blu&s;hed.</P>
<P>O, Fanny, what an indi&s;creet, and con&s;equently unhappy wretch, is your &s;i&s;|ter! Thank Heaven, Mrs. Walter is out of his reach! But have I not, by this un|guarded &s;peech, betrayed the &s;ecret to her tyrant! I never &s;hall forgive my&s;elf.</P>
<P>My Lucy, ever kind and attentive to her now unworthy friend, relieved us all from our embarra&s;&s;ment, by rendering the conver&s;ation general, and propo&s;ed our returning to the hou&s;e, as there was hardly time for me to dre&s;s, before dinner; and added, that &s;he would either endea|vour to entertain the gentlemen at the harp&s;ichord, or engage with them at billiards.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="107">We then all &s;et out, &s;eemingly at ea&s;e&mdash;But who can read the human heart, or the various &s;prings that actuate its move|ments!

Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having erred! its &s;ure attendants, fear, and &s;hame, now followed clo&s;e, and when I reached my toilet, and viewed my &s;ha|dow in the gla&s;s, my colour varied, as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions worked, and I became al|ternate red and pale.</P>
<P>Poor Ben&s;on &s;aw the effect, without the cau&s;e, and was alarmed&mdash;She would have got me drops, which I refu&s;ed: &s;ick, &s;ick at heart I was, but where is the medicine that can abate its conflicts!

<P>AMIDST the variety of di&s;agree|able thoughts which had di&s;turbed me, curio&s;ity a&s;&s;erted its rights in a fe|male brea&s;t, and increa&s;ed my unea&s;ine&s;s, by a wi&s;h to know how Lord Lucan had obtained my picture.&mdash;I never had but two miniatures taken of me; one, in my happy days, for my dear Fanny; and a &s;econd, la&s;t winter, in Dublin, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of my niece, &s;oon after &s;he came to live with us.&mdash;It was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t, and a train of very unplea&s;ant ideas &s;ucceeded to the thought of Harriet's having given him the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110">I &s;ent for her directly&mdash;When &s;he came into my dre&s;&s;ing-room, I perceived &s;he had been weeping, and I al&s;o perceived my picture on her arm&mdash;This put a &s;top to the inquiry I had de&s;igned to make; and by way of &s;aying &s;omething, I a&s;ked her where Lord Lucan was? She &s;aid &s;he had ju&s;t then left him in Sir Wil|liam's library.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity was again rai&s;ed to know the cau&s;e of Harriet's tears; I could not a&s;k her&mdash;But my heart informed me&mdash;She loves Lord Lucan.&mdash;Unhappy girl! yet &s;till far happier than I! &s;he may, with|out a blu&s;h, avow her pa&s;&s;ion; while mine mu&s;t cover me with endle&s;s &s;hame.</P>
<P>Yet wherefore &s;hould there be this fal&s;e di&s;tinction? If pa&s;&s;ion is involuntary,
<PB N="109" REF="111">
it cannot be criminal; 'tis con&s;equences only that can make it &s;o; and Harriet and Loui&s;a both may love, with inno|cence.&mdash;</P>
<P>Flattering &s;ophi&s;try! Alas! I would deceive my&s;elf, but cannot! Have I not vowed, even at the altar vowed, to love another? Yet can that vow be binding, which promi&s;es what is not in our pow|er, even at the time we make it? But grant it were, the contract &s;ure is mutual; and when one fails, the other &s;hould be free.</P>
<P>Wretched Loui&s;a! &s;trive no more to varni&s;h o'er thy faults&mdash;Thou wert a cri|minal, in the fir&s;t act, who wedded with|out love; and all the mi&s;eries which pro|ceed from thence, too ju&s;tly are thy due.</P>

<P>With infinite difficulty I di&s;covered that the innocent and unde&s;igning Har|riet had lent him my picture, and he &s;ent off his &s;ervant to France, to get it copied, who returned with it to A&s;h-park, on the day I fir&s;t &s;aw it in his hand.</P>
<P>I &s;hall never take notice of this affair, to her, as I too well know how difficult it mu&s;t be to refu&s;e the reque&s;t of one we love&mdash;But &s;urely his making this re|que&s;t mu&s;t have &s;everely pained her ten|der heart&mdash;Sweet, gentle innocent! I mo&s;t &s;incerely pity her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The dete&s;table Colonel Walter &s;tays with us &s;till, though una&s;ked&mdash;I think

he looks with prying eyes, on all my actions; yet what are they to him? He has no friend&s;hip, either for Sir Wil|liam, for me, or any one el&s;e.&mdash;Cruel con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that compelled me to ban|i&s;h Lord Lucan, and &s;uffer Colonel Wal|ter to remain in my hou&s;e!

but mocks the in&s;titution; and, if I may hazard the boldne&s;s of the expre&s;&s;ion, becomes <HI>guilty,</HI> before her <HI>crime</HI>; receives an antepa&s;t of mi&s;ery, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And puts her tru&s;t in miracles, for &s;afety."</Q></P>
<P>But the partiality of our ever dear and re&s;pected parents, &s;owed the fir&s;t &s;eeds of vanity, in my Loui&s;a's mind; they lived not long enough to be alarmed at its growth, and to eradicate the poi&s;on|ous weed&mdash;By their death, you became your own mi&s;tre&s;s, at an age when &s;elf-applau&s;e is predominant, in every female brea&s;t&mdash;Young, beautiful, rich, and accompli&s;hed, how was it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould e&s;cape the &s;nares of flattery? They twined about your heart; and I have great rea&s;on now to believe, and lament, that the envied preference you
<PB N="118" REF="120">
gave to Sir William Barton, by becom|ing his wife, was owing more to his having per&s;evered longer than the re&s;t of your admirers, in his attentions and at|tendance on you, than to that ju&s;t &s;elec|tion, which &s;hould be the reward of di&s;|tingui&s;hed merit, and in which both love and e&s;teem &s;hould happily unite.</P>
<P>At the time of your marriage, I had made but very &s;light ob&s;ervations on the matrimonial &s;tate, and therefore did not doubt, that though you declared your&s;elf in&s;en&s;ible of any pa&s;&s;ion for Sir William, you might be perfectly happy with him, all the days of your life&mdash;I am now convinced of the fallacy of this opi|nion, as well as of the imprudence of the declaration you then too openly and unguardedly made.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="121">Believe me, Loui&s;a, that this was the fir&s;t thing that &s;oured your hu&s;band's temper&mdash;Men are naturally proud and jealous; they do not ea&s;ily brook di&s;ap|pointments, or mortifications; a hope|le&s;s pur&s;uit mu&s;t be attended with both&mdash;We are not then to wonder either at Sir William's declining it, or re&s;enting his ill &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In a former letter you &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had Sir William continued to &s;olicit your affections a little longer, they would have been all his."</Q> You know not that, Loui&s;a; your vanity was flattered by the a&s;&s;iduities of a lover, and your pride revolted at the authority of a hu&s;band&mdash;Neither of the&s;e &s;entiments have any thing to do with pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;Had you loved the man you married, you would have wi&s;hed
<PB N="120" REF="122">
to pre&s;erve his affection, without being vain of it; and had you &s;een it declining, you would have tried every means to re|cover it, without con&s;idering how much your pride would be hurt by its lo&s;s.</P>
<P>There are, I am convinced, abun|dance of ingredients nece&s;&s;ary to form an happy union for life; but love is, in my opinion, of all others the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;Like the &s;un, it not only brightens and gilds every amiable quality of the beloved object, but draws forth every latent vir|tue in our hearts, and excites us to be|come as perfect as we can, in order to merit that affection which con&s;titutes our true happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Milton &s;eems to be of my opinion, when he makes the fir&s;t of lovers, and of men, &s;ay thus to Eve,&mdash;<Q><PB N="121" REF="123">

<P>I know not why, or how I have launch|ed out into this di&s;&s;ertation upon matri|mony, unle&s;s it be that I wi&s;h to avoid the painful &s;ubject of your la&s;t letters, and yet cannot turn my thoughts upon any thing quite foreign to it&mdash;I think I ought, at lea&s;t, to acknowledge that I am plea&s;ed with the re&s;olution you have &s;hewn in bani&s;hing Lord Lucan; and the delica|cy of your motive for confe&s;&s;ing your pa&s;&s;ion to him, is the only po&s;&s;ible excu&s;e that can be urged for &s;uch an hazardous impropriety.</P>
<P>But let me now hope that my dear Loui&s;a's virtue will &s;oon enable her to

ri&s;e above the want of an apology, and that a proper con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what &s;he owes to her&s;elf, will a&s;&s;i&s;t her to triumph over that unhappy weakne&s;s, which &s;he &s;o pathetically de&s;cribes, as the harbinger of fear and &s;hame&mdash;Hateful, de&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ions! O be they bani&s;hed far from every generous brea&s;t! and, in their room, may hope and joy expand my &s;i&s;ter's heart!</P>
<P>Mrs. Walter's health continues ex|tremely delicate; the phy&s;icians, who at|tend her, give me hopes that &s;he may re|cover, though &s;lowly&mdash;If it were not for that &s;weet promi&s;er Hope, I &s;hould at this moment be the mo&s;t wretched of mor|tals, for at this moment every creature that I truly love, is unhappy&mdash;Can I then be otherwi&s;e?

<Q><L>" Then all the boa&s;ted office of thy friend&s;hip,</L>
<L>" Was but to tell Loui&s;a, what a wretch &s;he is:</L>
<L>" Alas! What need that?"</L></Q>
<P>I Cannot help &s;aying, Fanny, that the&s;e lines &s;eem but too applicable to your la&s;t letter. When I poured forth the an|gui&s;h of my breaking heart before you, had I not a right to expect that my friend and &s;i&s;ter would have &s;poken peace to its &s;orrows, and poured wine and oil on its wounds? You tell me that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"rea&s;on and virtue forbid the&s;e tender offices, in my unhappy ca&s;e."</Q> Are rea&s;on and virtue, then, at war with wretchedne&s;s? And mu&s;t guilt be al|ways
<PB N="125" REF="127">
connected with mi&s;ery? Or is it, can it be true, that misfortunes loo&s;en the ties of blood as well as friend&s;hip, and leave the wretch infected by them, to be hurried down the &s;tream of life, at the mercy of their own wild pa&s;&s;ions, more de&s;tructive far than raging winds and &s;eas!</P>
<P>Forgive me, Fanny, for this horrid thought! I know your heart is generous and good, and that you did not mean to add to my di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;Nay, I am cer|tain that each wound you gave, was doubly felt by you&mdash;Yet why, my &s;i&s;ter, &s;hould you think it nece&s;&s;ary to deal &s;e|verely with me? If, as you &s;eem to think, vanity is my predominant foible, why did not my fair philo&s;opher find out its u&s;e, and play it off again&s;t my
<PB N="126" REF="128">
pre&s;ent weakne&s;s? We &s;hould never humble that heart too much, which we have any hopes of reclaiming.</P>
<P>When we become completely vile in our own &s;ight, we have but little rea&s;on to hope for the good opinion of others, which, I much fear, is one of our &s;trong|e&s;t incitements to virtue; and when, as you have before ob&s;erved, we are totally indifferent to what the world thinks of us, we too generally not only meet, but de&s;erve, its cen&s;ure and contempt.</P>
<P>A woman &s;till, my Fanny, under all my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I am inclined to ju&s;tify the foible you hint at; nay more, to prove that it approaches to the very pro|vince of virtue; as it is at lea&s;t capable of rou&s;ing it to action, and &s;ometimes of a&s;&s;i&s;ting its operations.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129"><Q REND="inline">"Re&s;pect thy&s;elf"</Q> is certainly one of the be&s;t tenets, that has ever been con|veyed to us&mdash;Yet &s;urely it &s;avours a lit|tle of <HI>l'amour propre</HI>; which term, though exactly tran&s;lated by the words, <HI>&s;elf love,</HI> conveys yet a different idea to my mind, and appears to have &s;ome|what more of the lightne&s;s of vanity, than of a &s;elf-applau&s;e, in material matters.</P>
<P>Bravo! Loui&s;a! How admirably have you trifled through this page, on a &s;ub|ject ab&s;olutely foreign to your heart? But has not my Fanny &s;et me the exam|ple? And &s;hall I not endeavour to imi|tate her? Alas! like all other copyi&s;ts, I fall &s;hort of the original, for if I write on, I &s;hall again recur to the &s;ad &s;ource of all my &s;orrows,<Q><L>" Again indulge the woman in my &s;oul,</L>
<L>" And give a loo&s;e to tears, and to complainings."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130">For your &s;ake, then, my Fanny, I will re&s;train my pen, and &s;uffer this let|ter to reach your hands, free from the &s;evere tax which has been too often im|po&s;ed on you, by my late corre&s;pondence. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For indeed I am not merry, but do beguile the thing I am, by &s;eeming otherwi&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>I am running into quotations; but they are natural to a di&s;turbed mind; as per&s;ons in &s;uch a &s;tate would rather u&s;e any body's &s;en&s;e, than their own&mdash;For whatever can divert the mind, or turn it from its own reflections, mu&s;t be a point gained from mi&s;ery. Therefore do I en|deavour thus to &s;port, I find, in vain; for laughter without mirth, is but hy&s;terical, and may end in tears.</P>
<P>My &s;incere&s;t good wi&s;hes attend Mrs. Walter, and I may venture to add, that

<HEAD>LETTER XLII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mi&s;s CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON.</HEAD>
<P>I Might with great truth and ju&s;tice re|ply to the lemma of my dear Loui&s;a's letter, by quoting the words that follow it, in the original;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>" O! rather &s;ay,</L><L>" I came to tell her how &s;he might be happy!</L><L>" To &s;oothe the &s;ecret angui&s;h of her &s;oul,</L><L>" To comfort that fair mourner!

<P><PB N="130" REF="132">If &s;oothing could alleviate your &s;uffer|ings, my pen &s;hould be taken from the cygnet's wing, and dipped in the honey of Hybla! But alas! my &s;i&s;ter, yours is a di&s;ea&s;e that will increa&s;e by indulgence, and which &s;everity alone can cure!</P>
<P>There have been in&s;tances where the hand of a &s;urgeon has trembled, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the mi&s;ery he was obliged to inflict on his patient.</P>
<P>Judge then how un&s;teadily I now hold the pen that is to wound the heart of my Loui&s;a, by telling her that I fear &s;he has committed an almo&s;t irreparable error?</P>
<P>I have already told you that it is long &s;ince I with grief beheld your partiality
<PB N="131" REF="133">
for Lord Lucan; but from the idea which you taught me to form of him, and from my thorough knowlege of the deli|cacy and propriety of your &s;entiments, joined to your &s;ituation, I had lulled my|&s;elf into a perfect &s;ecurity, that Lord Lu|can would never dare to in&s;ult the wife of Sir William Barton, with a declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion; and that finding it intirely hopele&s;s, he would either conquer or transfer it to &s;ome other object, from whom he might rea&s;onably expect a pro|per return.</P>
<P>Such an attachment as Lord Lucan's be may compared to winter plants, which, by the aid of hot-hou&s;es, are ren|dered capable of producing &s;ummer fruits, but mu&s;t decay and die without &s;uch artificial aid. Hope is the nur&s;e of
<PB N="132" REF="134">
love&mdash;without it, I am certain it cannot long exi&s;t, even in the mo&s;t romantic bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Can I then con&s;ider my Loui&s;a's con|duct as blamele&s;s, when I find Lord Lu|can has avowed his pa&s;&s;ion? But what is the &s;entence which you would have pro|nounced, twelve months ago, upon a married woman who had declared that pa&s;&s;ion to be mutual? <HI>Guilty, guilty upon honour!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter XXXIII. p. 60.</NOTE></P>
<P>You have &s;till candour enough to judge your&s;elf as &s;everely, as you could any one el&s;e; you acknowlege your&s;elf a criminal; but whither are your candor, and your judgment both fled, when you endeavour to derive merit from what you
<PB N="133" REF="135">
allow to be a crime, and &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You confe&s;&s;ed your pa&s;&s;ion, to pre&s;erve your virtue?"</Q></P>
<P>I begin to be extremely apprehen&s;ive that rea&s;on is a very u&s;ele&s;s property to man, and can &s;eldom do more than di|rect our choice, in things that are merely indifferent to us. Apathy is not natural to the human mind; and yet from the mo|ment our pa&s;&s;ions begin to operate with any degree of vigour, that &s;ame boa&s;ted rea&s;on, which philo&s;ophers tell us &s;upplies its place, by controuling their emotions, and directing their pur&s;uits, not only be|comes in&s;tantly &s;ub&s;ervient to them, but meanly conde&s;cends to enter into the de|fence of their mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equen|ces, and readily engages in the plea&s;ing, but baneful office, of a&s;&s;i&s;ting us to im|po&s;e upon our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">This is, and mu&s;t be true&mdash;At lea&s;t I wi&s;h to think &s;o; for I would much ra|ther attribute my Loui&s;a's errors to the general defects of our nature, than ac|count for them by &s;uppo&s;ing any parti|cular weakne&s;s, either in her rea&s;on, or her virtue&mdash;And &s;urely &s;he mu&s;t her&s;elf acknowlege a failure in that judgment, that can be per&s;uaded we may &s;et bounds to the encroachments of a lover, by tell|ing him that he is beloved!</P>
<P>Alas, Loui&s;a! Lord Lucan is not <HI>bani&s;hed from A&s;h-park, from Southfield, from your &s;ight, for ever!</HI> But both the world, and I, without being over rigid, have a right to expect that he &s;hould no more be permitted to plead his pa&s;&s;ion, or avail him&s;elf of yours.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould be inclined to di&s;pute the authority which demands this &s;acrifice,
<PB N="135" REF="137">
let me remind you that there is one, who has an undoubted right to claim it; let your honour then make a willing &s;a|crifice of all future connection with Lord Lucan, as the only atonement you can now make for the injury you have done Sir William Barton.</P>
<P>By this means, and this alone, you may again recover your happine&s;s; for I know you too well to &s;uppo&s;e that it can ever be compatible with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of continuing to act in oppo&s;ition to the &s;tricte&s;t rectitude&mdash;I know too, that you have &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient to accom|pli&s;h this arduous ta&s;k; and that our men|tal, like our bodily &s;trength, is increa&s;ed and invigorated by u&s;e. That generous frankne&s;s, which is the genuine offspring of virtue, &s;hall again reanimate my be|loved
<PB N="136" REF="138">
Loui&s;a's face, the mild eye of friend|&s;hip &s;hall no longer be painful to her, and &s;he &s;hall endure the piercing look of inquiry from her hu&s;band's eyes, with &s;oft, yet &s;teady dignity.&mdash;O may my wi&s;hes be prophetic! Amen, Amen!</P>
<P>I will now venture to tell you that I am truly grieved for the young, the in|nocent, and amiable Harriet! My con|cern may po&s;&s;ibly remind you of Swift's lines,
<Q><L>" Should &s;ome neighbour feel a pain,</L>
<L>" Ju&s;t in the part where I complain," &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>I acknowledge the &s;ympathy between us, and would do much to cure her ma|lady.</P>
<P>She has, however, the advantage of me in every re&s;pect;&mdash;&s;he is younger, and, of cour&s;e, the impre&s;&s;ion which her
<PB N="137" REF="139">
heart has received is more likely be era&s;|ed.&mdash;The letters we carve on &s;aplings, wear out with their growth, while tho&s;e that are imprinted on the perfect tree re|main indelible.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is by no means impo&s;&s;ible that Lord Lucan may love her yet; for I repeat my opinion, that his pa&s;&s;ion for you is quite a &s;ickly plant, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily peri&s;h, as I am perfectly con|vinced that you don't mean to cheri&s;h it longer.</P>
<P>For all the&s;e good and weighty rea|&s;ons, I think &s;he may hope, or, at lea&s;t, I will do &s;o for her, that, one way or other, her heart may be &s;et at ea&s;e.&mdash;I am in a praying mood, and will &s;ay, amen! to this wi&s;h al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140">I would add another petition to tho&s;e I have already made, if I hoped it would &s;ucceed; but I almo&s;t begin to de&s;pair of Mrs. Walter's recovery&mdash;She conti|nues to langui&s;h, without any vi&s;ible &s;ign of amendment, and the phy&s;icians now think that the air of a more &s;outh|ern clime, is the only chance &s;he has for life.</P>
<P>She has written to the good Pere Guil|laume, to recommend her to a convent that will receive her and her child, as pen&s;ioners, and allow her the liberty of going out in a carriage, for exerci&s;e, which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to her ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Were I only to con&s;ider my&s;elf, the pain I feel at the thought of parting
<PB N="139" REF="141">
with this charming woman would tempt me to wi&s;h that I had never known her; but how amply am I recompen&s;ed for that, and a thou&s;and other &s;ufferings, by the delightful reflection of having ren|dered her mind perfectly tranquil, nay happy, by indulging my&s;elf in &s;ettling a &s;mall, but decent provi&s;ion, on her darl|ing child.</P>
<P>Can all the diamonds that ever i&s;&s;ued from the Indian mines afford to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors that heart-felt glow of &s;atisfac|tion I enjoyed, when I had perfected the deed which conveyed two thou&s;and pounds into the hands of tru&s;tees, for the u&s;e of the young Olivia Walter?</P>
<P>I was &s;o apprehen&s;ive that the &s;trong emotions of the mother's gratitude,
<PB N="140" REF="142">
might have affected her delicate frame, that I was almo&s;t tempted to conceal this matter from her; yet I wi&s;hed to remove every fear or doubt, which the weakne&s;s and languor of her &s;pirits might &s;ugge&s;t, with regard to her child's future fate.</P>
<P>I wrote her a few lines, to tell her what I had done; and added, that I would de|bar my&s;elf from the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her, till &s;he &s;hould give me a promi&s;e un|der her hand, never to mention this bu|&s;ine&s;s to me.</P>
<P>She promi&s;ed, indeed, what was im|po&s;&s;ible for her to perform; and, at our next interview, I was convinced, that, as the Peruvian prince&s;s &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To be thoroughly generous, you mu&s;t li&s;ten to acknowledgments."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="143">I have promi&s;ed, that if it &s;hould plea&s;e Providence to call her to a &s;tate of bli&s;s, I will immediately take the little Olivia under my care; and, if I live, I will mo&s;t faithfully di&s;charge the plea&s;ing and im|portant tru&s;t.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lady BARTON to Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</HEAD>
<P>SEEK no longer, my Fanny, to &s;ave me from the mi&s;eries which I have brought upon my&s;elf, but try, my &s;i&s;ter, to &s;ecure your own peace, by devoting to oblivion, the memory of a wretch that &s;eems marked for de&s;truction.&mdash;I feel the &s;nares of fate wound round me, and I but vainly &s;truggle to e&s;cape the toils.</P>
<P>A little gleam of comfort had beamed upon me, from your la&s;t letter;&mdash;the kindne&s;s of your wi&s;hes had rai&s;ed an ar|dor in my mind, for their accompli&s;h|ment, which amounted almo&s;t to a hope of &s;ucce&s;s; and I looked forward, with anxious de&s;ire, to &s;ome future aera, when
<PB N="143" REF="145">
my happine&s;s &s;hould confirm your pro|phecy.</P>
<P>In this temper of mind, I walked &s;low|ly and lonely along to the temple, which I have already mentioned to you; and if now and then a few vagrant tears &s;tray|ed down my cheeks I con&s;idered them as drops of &s;alutary woe, and did not once wi&s;h to re&s;train the healthful cur|rent.&mdash;In fine, I may truly &s;ay, that many weeks have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince my poor harra&s;&s;|ed mind enjoyed &s;o &s;weet a calm before.&mdash;When I had reached my little a&s;y|lum, I re-read your letter, and found but one pa&s;&s;age in it that gave me pain; I will not now &s;ay which it was, for that angui&s;h has been entirely ab&s;orbed in a far greater one.</P>
<P>I took up a pen to write to you, which in&s;tantly dropped from my hand, at the
<PB N="144" REF="146">
&s;ight of Lord Lucan's portrait, which lay before me on the table.&mdash;By an involun|tary motion I took up the picture, and, looking on it, exclaimed,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is too true, Loui&s;a! <HI>Lord Lucan is not bani&s;h|ed from Southfield, from A&s;h-park, from my &s;ight, for ever!</HI>"&mdash;</Q>encroaching and pre|&s;uming man! cou'd&s;t thou not be con|tent with that ideal likene&s;s, which my too fond fancy had already traced upon my mind, but at the hazard of my reputa|tion would obtrude this mimic re&s;em|blance on my &s;ight.</P>
<P>While I pronounced the&s;e words, the door opened, and Colonel Walter &s;tood before me.&mdash;I dropped the picture&mdash;he took it up,&mdash;&s;eated him&s;elf by me, and addre&s;&s;ed me in pretty near the &s;ame

<P>Never was health more &s;incerely wel|comed by a dying wretch, than &s;ickne&s;s was now by me&mdash;I hoped, I tru&s;ted, I &s;hould be relea&s;ed! and invoked the king of terrors, with the unhappy Con&s;tance,

<P>THE &s;eeing my letter dated from this place, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure account to my dear Loui&s;a, for my &s;ilence, at a time when &s;he &s;tood mo&s;t in need of every con&s;olation that friend&s;hip could be&s;tow on a tenderly beloved and &s;uffering &s;i&s;ter&mdash;I am however &s;elfi&s;h enough to rejoice that I was unacquaint|ed with the danger that threatened your life, till it was pa&s;t, for I had the painful plea&s;ure of receiving both your letters, on my arrival here, la&s;t night.</P>
<P>Truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and affecting as they are, my head is at pre&s;ent &s;o filled with
<PB N="166" REF="168">
the extraordinary events which have hap|pened within a very &s;hort &s;pace, that though my heart is truly &s;en&s;ible of your afflictions, I find it impo&s;&s;ible to give its feelings vent, till I have informed you of a circum&s;tance which I am certain will afford you the &s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Delia! my brother's beloved Delia! Delia Colville lives! as Zanga &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fir&s;t recover that, and then you &s;hall hear further."</Q>&mdash;Our good angel! our dear Mrs. Walter! received a letter from Pere Guillaume, about the middle of la&s;t month, acquainting her that he would meet her at Calais, and attend her to what part of France &s;he plea&s;ed; but were he to recommend any particular convent, it &s;hould be Les Dames Ur&s;u|lines, at St. Omers, as the &s;uperior
<PB N="167" REF="169">
was his near relation, and particular friend.</P>
<P>This reeommendation was perfectly agreeable to Mrs. Walter, for many rea|&s;ons; the vicinity of St. Omers to Eng|land, was perhaps the &s;tronge&s;t, as it flattered her with the hopes of &s;eeing me, at &s;ome time or other, if &s;he lived; and rendered the immediate removal of her daughter convenient, in ca&s;e of her death.</P>
<P>I accompanied her to Dover, and feared that I had taken my la&s;t farewell of my amiable friend, when I &s;aw her embark for Calais&mdash;I heard from her, in a few days after our parting, and &s;he was not wor&s;e&mdash;I had then determined to &s;pend the remainder of the &s;ummer
<PB N="168" REF="170">
at Cleveland-hall, in executing &s;ome lit|tle romantic plans of improvement, in order to amu&s;e my&s;elf, and &s;urpri&s;e Sir George at his return from Italy, which he had promi&s;ed &s;hould be before winter. But a &s;econd letter from Mrs. Walter afforded me an opportunity of &s;urpri&s;ing him, indeed! She told me that in the convent where &s;he then re&s;ided, there was a very beautiful young Engli&s;h lady, who went by the name of Wil&s;on, who, upon having &s;een the addre&s;s of her let|ter to me, as it went to the tour, in or|der to be &s;ent to the po&s;t office, implored her permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak to her in pri|vate; that &s;ome time had ela&s;ped before &s;he could find an opportunity, and when &s;he did, &s;he informed her that her name was Colville, Delia Colville! I again re|peat it! That &s;he had been placed there,
<PB N="169" REF="171">
by her mother, without her knowledge, or con&s;ent, who had de&s;ired that &s;he might be clo&s;ely confined, debarred the u&s;e of pen and ink, and prevented from even going into the parlour, or conver&s;|ing with any of the pen&s;ioners; as &s;he was repre&s;ented to be &s;o artful, that &s;he would corrupt and impo&s;e on them by the in&s;incere plau&s;ibility of her manners, and was actually upon the point of di&s;|gracing her family, by a &s;hameful con|nection with a man of inferior rank and fortune.&mdash;That in con&s;equence of this cruel a&s;per&s;ion, &s;he had been treated with the utmo&s;t &s;everity that the rules of the convent would admit of, and that from the time of her entrance, till that moment, &s;he had never heard from her mother, or any other per&s;on what|&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172">She then, blu&s;hing, mentioned Sir George Cleveland, and &s;aid &s;he had long vainly flattered her&s;elf, that he would have &s;ought her out, and relea&s;ed her from &s;o inquitous and cruel a confine|ment; but that if even he had forgot|ten and for&s;aken her, &s;he was convinced that his &s;i&s;ter's humanity would intere&s;t it&s;elf in behalf of an oppre&s;&s;ed and injur|ed per&s;on, whom &s;he had once honoured with the name of friend!</P>
<P>She added, that the mildne&s;s of her temper, and the perfect acquie&s;cence &s;he had &s;hewn under the &s;evere re&s;traints that were impo&s;ed on her, had influenced the nuns to treat her with le&s;s har&s;hne&s;s than at fir&s;t, and that &s;he had been lately al|lowed the honour of conver&s;ing with the &s;uperior; but that the moment &s;he at|tempted
<PB N="171" REF="173">
to ju&s;tify her&s;elf from her mo|ther's &s;lander, &s;he was enjoined &s;ilence, and obliged to retire to her cell; after having this reflection urged again&s;t her, that it mu&s;t be always more natural to &s;up|po&s;e children to be undutiful or ungrateful, than that parents &s;hould be unkind or un|ju&s;t. This maxim is certainly true, in ge|neral; but there are &s;ometimes in&s;tances which occur in life, that baffle all philo|&s;ophy, with regard to the human mind.</P>
<P>O, my Loui&s;a, does not your heart grieve for the &s;ufferings of the innocent and unoffending Delia? When Mrs. Walter promi&s;ed her to acquaint me with her &s;ituation, &s;he cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is enough! I know Mi&s;s Cleveland; I &s;hall be relea&s;ed! Yet &s;ure Sir George will at lea&s;t accompany his &s;i&s;ter, if
<PB N="172" REF="174">
&s;he &s;hould come to take me out of my confinement, and I &s;hall &s;ee him once again."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Walter told her, &s;he believed that would be impo&s;&s;ible, for&mdash;She in|terrupted her, by exclaiming, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is he married?

<P>The moment I received Mrs. Walter's letter, I went immediately to councellor

W&mdash;, to know what were the proper and legal &s;teps to be taken for the reco|very of my beloved Delia: he told me he would wait on the lord chancellor, next day, and furni&s;h me with pro|per powers to compel Mrs. Colville to produce her daughter in the chancery-chamber, who, as a minor, was to be con&s;idered as a ward of the court, though the guardian&s;hip of her per&s;on and for|tune had been before granted to her dete&s;table mother.</P>
<P>I then returned home, wrote to Mrs. Walter, and enclo&s;ed a few lines to De|lia, entreating her to keep up her &s;pirits, till I could effect her relea&s;e, which I promi&s;ed to do with the utmo&s;t expedi|tion.&mdash;I ordered my cloaths to be pack|ed up, and a chai&s;e with four hor&s;es to
<PB N="274" REF="176">
be in readine&s;s, the next day; and the moment Coun&s;ellor W&mdash; furni&s;hed me with my in&s;tructions, I &s;et out for Dover, accompanied by my maid and two men &s;ervants.&mdash;There was a me&s;|&s;enger di&s;patched at the &s;ame time, with his lord&s;hip's order, to Mrs. Colville; but if &s;he &s;hould not be found, or &s;hould ab|&s;cond upon receiving it, I am to apply to Lord H&mdash;, our amba&s;&s;ador in France, whom I have the honour of being very well acquainted with, to procure a &s;pe|cial mandate from the court of Ver|&s;ailles, for her relea&s;e.</P>
<P>I wrote to my brother, who is now at Naples, in a very ambiguous &s;tile, hint|ing as if I had heard &s;ome vague report of Delia's being alive; for I dur&s;t not tru&s;t him with the mighty joy at once,
<PB N="175" REF="177">
as I have been told that the &s;udden ef|fects of that pa&s;&s;ion have &s;ometimes been as fatal in their con&s;equences, as tho&s;e of grief.</P>
<P>I then informed him of my intention of going to Paris; and &s;aid, as I knew all places were indifferent to him, I hoped he would have galantry enough to meet me there, as the plea&s;ure I pro|mi&s;ed my&s;elf in &s;eeing him, was the principal cau&s;e of my undertaking the journey.</P>
<P>The moment of my arrival at St. Omers, I was met by Mrs. Walter: I need not de&s;cribe to you the effects of our interview.&mdash;I flatter my&s;elf that &s;he looks better than &s;he did: &s;he &s;ays the joy &s;he feels at having been, though ac|cidentally,
<PB N="176" REF="178">
the in&s;trument of good to the amiable Delia, has rou&s;ed her &s;pirits from the torpid &s;tate they had continued in, while &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf but as an u&s;ele&s;s burthen, or, at be&s;t, an in&s;ignifi|cant blank, in life.</P>
<P>She told me &s;he had not had an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing Mi&s;s Colville &s;ince &s;he received my letter, but at prayers; that &s;he had endeavoured to render her looks as expre&s;&s;ive as po&s;&s;ible, by the chear|fulne&s;s of her air; and that Delia &s;eemed to under&s;tand the hint in her favour. She advi&s;ed me not to go to the convent, as it was certain that I &s;hould not be permitted to &s;ee Mi&s;s Colville; and her hearing that I had been there, might throw her off her guard, &s;o far, as to alarm the nuns, and make them con|fine
<PB N="177" REF="179">
her &s;till more clo&s;ely, or perhaps, tranfer her, as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, over to &s;ome other convent.</P>
<P>I was convinced by her rea&s;ons, and, re&s;training my fond impatience, I &s;et out the next morning for Paris, where I arrived la&s;t night, and have the mortifi|cation to learn, this morning, that Mrs. Colville is gone to Toulou&s;e, as it is thought, to &s;ettle there.&mdash;The lord chancellor's me&s;&s;enger is gone off po&s;t to her; and here mu&s;t I remain till his return.</P>
<P>And now let me a&s;&s;ure my Loui&s;a, that not even the joy I feel at the cer|tainty of Delia's re&s;toration, can prevent me for a moment from &s;ympathizing, in the tendere&s;t manner, with her di&s;tre&s;s;
<PB N="178" REF="180">
the circum&s;tances of which are certainly equally difficult and mortifying.</P>
<P>There never was any thing &s;o unfor|tunately critical as your &s;ituation with that vile Walter, when Sir William's ar|rival was announced: the &s;nare, as you &s;ay, &s;eemed contrived by fate&mdash;I honour your &s;truggling through it, and not let|ing the wretch triumph in the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme, which he certainly would have done, had you carried on the de|ceit beyond the moment that it was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;I am grieved, but not &s;urpri&s;ed, at the effect which the angui&s;h of your mind has had upon your con&s;ti|tution; and am, I hope, truly thankful for your recovery&mdash;And may it be a perfect one!</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181">Surely, Loui&s;a, you ought to think Lord Lucan to blame, with regard to the picture; he mu&s;t have hazarded your reputation, by making a confidante of the per&s;on who placed it on your table. Can it be po&s;&s;ible that the enamoured Harriet can have verified, nay exceeded, the romantic ideas of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive tender|ne&s;s, which Prior has given us in the character of his Emma.</P>
<P>I know not what to think; but if Har|riet be indeed the confidante of Lord Lucan, &s;he claims the highe&s;t degree of admiration, that the &s;tronge&s;t fortitude, joined with the tendere&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, can po&s;&s;ibly excite&mdash;But this character com|prehends, perhaps, &s;omething more than woman.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Naples.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Verily believe, my dear Lucan, that there never was a more unfortunate kinght-errant than my&s;elf, and that the renowned hero of La Mancha was but a prototype, both of my folly and my
<PB N="184" REF="186">
&s;ufferings. I think, I want nothing but a '&s;quire as tri&s;tful as your&s;elf, to record my mi&s;adventures in the &s;tile of a ballad, called the Di&s;a&s;trous Traveller, or Lord Hume's Garland&mdash;which would certain|ly &s;uper&s;ede the Babes in the Wood, and Barbara Allen, in the Engli&s;h Chronicle; and &s;et all the nur&s;ery-maids and chil|dren in our nation a-blubbering.</P>
<P>My la&s;t informed you how completely I was duped at Venice; that I had lo&s;t my mi&s;tre&s;s, and my money: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Baga|telles! not worth thinking of, &s;ay you; cheaply off, for &s;ome thou&s;ands,"</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;Well! philo&s;ophy is a fine thing, &s;aid I to my&s;elf! and I will endeavour to think like Lord Lucan&mdash;But I had better have recollected the famous &s;en|tence recorded to have been uttered
<PB N="185" REF="187">
from the pulpit, by an Iri&s;h bi&s;hop (who by the way was an Engli&s;hman,) and prepared my&s;elf for what was to follow&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Single misfortunes, (&s;aid his reve|rence) never come alone, and the greate&s;t of evils is attended by greater."</Q></P>
<P>Now to apply my text.&mdash;In a very ill temper, and with about a hundred pieces in my pocket, I &s;et out from Venice; and journeying by land and by water, arrived &s;afe in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical territories. About two leagues from Tivoli my car|riage broke down; I had no attendants but one &s;ervant, who &s;at in the carriage with me, and very ill &s;upplied the place of my former fellow-traveller; I had left one footman &s;ick at Venice, who was to follow me, and di&s;charged all the re&s;t of my u&s;ele&s;s parade.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188">I did not chu&s;e to leave my baggage to the care, or rather mercy, of the po&s;ti|lion, and as it was not quite dark, I or|dered Saunders, you know old Robert, to &s;tay by the chai&s;e, till I could &s;end people from Tivoli, either to mend it, or a&s;&s;i&s;t him to bring my trunks to &s;ome place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>I had not walked half a league, when I was attacked by banditti, who de|manded my pur&s;e, and on my attempt|ing to make &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, as I wore a couteau de cha&s;&s;e, they knocked me down, gave me &s;everal cuts over the head, &s;tript me of my money, cloaths, and watch, and left me for dead on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>As it grew late, Saunders became alarmed for my &s;afety, and tried to pre|vail
<PB N="187" REF="189">
on the po&s;tilion to let him have one of the hor&s;es, in order to overtake and guard me on the road to the town. The fellow either was, or pretended to be, afraid to &s;tay by him&s;elf, they therefore mounted the pair, and &s;et out together for Tivoli.</P>
<P>As I was left directly in the highway, the hor&s;es &s;tarted as they came up to me, and when the men alighted to &s;ee what was the matter, they found me weltering in my blood, but with &s;o much appear|ance of life that I &s;till breathed, and &s;ometimes groaned.&mdash;Poor old Saunders tore off his &s;hirt to bind up my wounds, as well as he could in the dark, and co|vered me with his own cloaths, while the po&s;tilion rode off in &s;earch of a &s;ur|geon and a litter, to convey me to &s;ome &s;helter.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190">My &s;en&s;es did not return till the next day, when I found my&s;elf covered with bandages, and &s;o faint and weak with lo&s;s of blood that I could not &s;peak. Saun|ders gave a &s;cream of joy, at &s;eeing me open my eyes, and recounted what had befallen me.</P>
<P>I lay in this &s;tate of mi&s;ery above three weeks, and when I was able to ri&s;e, I had not a &s;ingle garment of any &s;ort to put on; for the po&s;tilion, I pre&s;ume, con&s;idering that I &s;hould have no further occa&s;ion for them, had a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the office of an executor, and carried off my baggage, with the chai&s;e and hor&s;es, and got clear out of his Holine&s;s's dominions before there was any inquiry made after him.</P>
<P>I &s;ent Saunders off immediately to Rome, with a draught on my banker,
<PB N="189" REF="191">
which he received, and returned as quick as po&s;&s;ible; but I was &s;till unable to travel, and a wound which I had re|ceived in my right arm, prevented my being able to u&s;e a pen, without &s;uffer|ing extremely&mdash;Let this account for your not hearing from me during my con|finement.</P>
<P>As I had a good deal of lei&s;ure to re|flect upon my own folly, I determined to grow wi&s;e incontinently; and thought the be&s;t proof I could give of my di&s;cretion, was to turn my &s;teps towards England&mdash;I was however obliged to go to Rome, for a few days, to &s;ettle with my banker&mdash;As &s;oon as my bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;patch|ed, I &s;et out, in pur&s;uance of my plan, and have arrived thus far, on my route over.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">I went, as was natural, to the hou&s;e where I had formerly lived with Marga|rita; and could not help making &s;ome inquiries after her: to my great &s;urpri&s;e, they told me that &s;he was then in this city, and lived in a mo&s;t exemplary man|ner, with an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who was be|lieved to be her brother.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit of revenge took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me the moment that I heard of this pre|tended prie&s;t and brother, and I deter|mined to &s;ee my fallen angel, upbraid her with her perfidy, and puni&s;h the vil|lain who had robbed me of my mi&s;tre&s;s, and cheated me of my money.</P>
<P>I wandered about Naples, for &s;everal days, without being able to di&s;cover any trace of her: at la&s;t I bethought my&s;elf
<PB N="191" REF="193">
of vi&s;iting the churches, for as &s;he now pre|tended to be a devotee, I might po&s;&s;ibly meet her in one of them&mdash;Accordingly I one day &s;aw a woman kneeling at a confe&s;&s;ional, who, though &s;he was veiled, I immediately knew to be Margarita.</P>
<P>I waited for a long time before &s;he had concluded her devotions, and joined her ju&s;t as &s;he was going out of the porch; when I &s;poke to her, &s;he lifted up her veil, and looked at me with a counte|nance &s;o full of &s;weetne&s;s, that I in&s;tant|ly forgot my re&s;entment, and could have fallen at her feet, and entreated her to be reconciled to me.</P>
<P>She &s;poke to me in a low voice, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have u&s;ed you ill, my lord, but I have been &s;everely puni&s;hed for my
<PB N="192" REF="194">
crime; I dare not hope you &s;hould again receive me into your favour, but come and accept of all the re&s;titution that is now in my power to make you; I live in the Strada del Santo Marco; my tyrant will be a&s;leep by eleven o'clock, I &s;hall then at lea&s;t have an opportunity of imploring your for|givene&s;s&mdash;I dare not talk to you longer, adieu."</Q></P>
<P>De&s;pi&s;e me as you will, Lucan, I con|fe&s;s that I felt my tenderne&s;s for this infa|mous woman revive, and in&s;tead of go|ing directly to a magi&s;trate, or endea|vouring to do my&s;elf ju&s;tice on her, and her vile accomplice, I counted the mi|nutes with impatient expectation of that happy one, which &s;hould again re&s;tore me to the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing and con|ver&s;ing with her.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195">At the time appointed I repaired to my rendezvous, which was at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from the place where I lived, and in a very retired part of the town: as I pa&s;&s;ed through an unfre|quented &s;treet, I was &s;et upon by four bravos; I in&s;tantly drew my &s;word, and determined to &s;ell my life as dear as po&s;|&s;ible&mdash;As I had the advantage of a wall at my back, I defended my&s;elf &s;ucce&s;s|fully, for a few minutes; but &s;hould have been overpowered if providence had not &s;ent Sir George Cleveland, and another gentleman, to my re&s;cue. At their approach the bravoes would have fled, but I &s;ecured one of them whom I had wounded, and who proved to be the pretended prie&s;t and brother of Mar|garita.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196">When we had lodged him properly, and I had got a &s;light wound, which I had received, dre&s;&s;ed, I communicated the whole of my adventure frankly to Sir George, and wi&s;hed him to accompany me in pur&s;uit of that worthle&s;s woman, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be an accomplice in the intended a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and whom I now re&s;olved to give up to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Sir George is a gallant fellow, Lucan. He talked &s;o very rationally, that he di&s;|&s;uaded me from my purpo&s;e, as he &s;aid the bringing Margarita to puni&s;hment, if I &s;hould have re&s;olution &s;ufficient to do &s;o, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity expo&s;e my&s;elf; ob&s;erving al&s;o, that I ought not to pur|&s;ue a wretch with too much rigour, whom I had formerly contributed to render abandoned.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="197">His remarks upon the folly and ba&s;e|ne&s;s of men, in their commerce with the unhappy of the other &s;ex, were truly ge|nerous&mdash;I remember but one of them at pre&s;ent. I think he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That we fir&s;t take pains to de&s;troy the founda|tion of every female virtue, mode&s;ty; and are then &s;urpri&s;ed to find the &s;u|per&s;tructure totter."</Q>&mdash;That is fooli&s;h enough to be &s;ure, though we practi&s;e it every day.</P>
<P>But to conclude, for I begin to think you are heartily tired, as even I grow a little weary, though I am talking of my|&s;elf, which is the plea&s;ante&s;t of all &s;ub|jects.&mdash;The next morning brought me a mo&s;t doleful letter, from my Fair Peni|tent, entreating me, for the love I once bore her, not to pro&s;ecute her brother,
<PB N="196" REF="198">
as &s;he &s;till affected to &s;tile him, declaring her&s;elf intirely innocent of any evil inten|tions of his, with regard to my life, and offering to refund whatever remained of the jewels &s;he had robbed me of, provid|ed I would but remit the pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>I con&s;ulted with Cleveland, who ad|vi&s;ed me not to be prevailed on to &s;uffer &s;uch a pe&s;t to &s;ociety, as Pere Jacques, to e&s;cape; but if he would give up his accomplices, to u&s;e my intere&s;t to get them all &s;ent to the gallies together; as to <HI>la bella Signora,</HI> he thought I &s;hould make terms with her al&s;o, and let her compound for her crimes by a life of re|pentance&mdash;That the jewels &s;he men|tioned, &s;hould be &s;old, in order to pay her pen&s;ion among <HI>les Filles repenties,</HI> where &s;he &s;hould be obliged to enter on her probation immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199">I was charmed with this &s;cheme, and by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance have happily put it in execution.&mdash;Would he could be as &s;uc|ce&s;sful in re&s;toring me to the e&s;teem of an amiable woman, as he has been in extricating me from the artifices of a vile one&mdash;But I have never yet dared to name Mi&s;s Cleveland to him; and I will patiently go through a year of probation under his eye, before I even pre&s;ume to hope that he will favour my &s;uit.&mdash;In the mean time I am happy to find, from his behaviour, that he is a &s;tranger to mine, upon that occa&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lord LUCAN to Lord HUME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Hume,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Sincerely congratulate you on the <HI>operatical denou&egrave;ment</HI> of your Ita|lian <HI>comedie</HI>; and think that even Me|ta&s;ta&s;io has not wound up any of his cata&s;trophes with more poetical ju&s;tice, than you have &s;hewn in the di&s;po&s;al of your dramatis per&s;onae.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t enviable part of your good fortune, is the having met with &s;uch a friend as Sir George Cleveland, who&s;e knowlege of the world, joined to an ex|cellent under&s;tanding, and an amiable heart, (all which he has &s;hewn in the ma|nagement of your affair with Margarita) mu&s;t render him at once an object of your
<PB N="200" REF="202">
affection and re&s;pect; and afford you an opportunity of benefiting, both by his precepts and example.</P>
<P>I have not the honour of knowing Sir George, but have heard his character, de&s;cription, and &s;tory. He is neither older, wi&s;er, nor better principled than you are; to what then are we to impute the difference between the preceptor and the pupil? To nothing more than a cir|cum&s;tance which I am glad to lay hold of, for your in&s;truction. He had con|ceived a &s;trong, but cha&s;te pa&s;&s;ion, for a woman of merit, who&s;e name I know not; than which, nothing in nature more elevates the mind, improves the under&s;tanding, refines the manners, and purges the affections of man. His mi&s;|tre&s;s is dead, I hear lately, but the influ|ence
<PB N="201" REF="203">
of virtue reaches beyond the grave; for a heart once rendered pure, like a tran&s;muted metal, can never degenerate into its original ba&s;ene&s;s again.</P>
<P>I have often thought that many of the errors of our young men of quality, are owing to a wrong choice of the govern|ors to whom they are intru&s;ted, at the mo&s;t critical aera of their lives, when their pa&s;&s;ions are &s;tronge&s;t, and their judgment weake&s;t&mdash;I mean when they are thought old enough to be &s;ent abroad for improvement, and not deemed wi&s;e enough to conduct them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Fathers and guardians, on this occa|&s;ion, generally fix on &s;ome per&s;on of learning, which by the ignorant is fre|quently mi&s;taken for &s;en&s;e; as what is
<PB N="202" REF="204">
called a liberal education, is as fal&s;ly, and frequently, &s;uppo&s;ed to be as &s;ynonimous with a liberal mind.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t blockheads I have ever known, have been bred in college&mdash;Neither ab&s;urdity nor meanne&s;s pre|vent a man from becoming ma&s;ter of a language, nor of arriving at a competent knowlege in any particular branch of &s;cience.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are not the qualifications ne|ce&s;&s;ary to form a noble mind; and yet an ignorant pedant, is not only the fir&s;t per&s;on from whom we receive the rudi|ments of education, but is too often the la&s;t, to who&s;e final care we are con&s;igned, to receive that fine poli&s;h, to which our mind and manners owe their mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lord HUME to Lord LUCAN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Tell you, Lucan, there is no &s;uch thing as re&s;i&s;ting fate&mdash;Here am I, with as good and &s;ober di&s;po&s;itions as any man of two and twenty in Europe, for ever getting into &s;ome &s;crape or other, without temptation, or excu&s;e; or even knowing how, or why, I became engaged! Well, then, a knight errant I certainly am, of nature's own dubbing, and I will now <HI>courteou&s;ly</HI> relate to you, my&s;elf, for want of a '&s;quire, my new achievement.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t I mu&s;t acquaint you, that ever &s;ince our arrival here, Sir George
<PB N="209" REF="211">
Cleveland has been &s;o totally taken up with &s;ome private bu&s;ine&s;s of his own, that poor melancholy I have been left to the plea&s;ant amu&s;ement of contemplating my own extravagance, and folly, which has, you know, deprived me of the hap|pine&s;s of &s;eeing, or conver&s;ing with his charming &s;i&s;ter, who has met him here; and as I quitted Naples almo&s;t at a mi|nute's warning, I left old Robert to pack up my cloaths, and bring them after me.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation I could not po&s;&s;ibly make my appearance in public, or even venture to vi&s;it any of my quondam ac|quaintance, in my travelling-dre&s;s.&mdash;I &s;pent two days, <HI>tout &s;eul,</HI> and found an unlucky truth, that any company would be le&s;s dull to me than my own.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="212">On this di&s;covery I &s;allied forth, and in &s;auntering along the Boulevard, I happened to meet Jack Wil&s;on, of the guards, who is as di&s;&s;ipated a genius as my&s;elf. I propo&s;ed to him our going to dine at &s;ome of the environs of Paris, to which he readily agreed&mdash;A chai&s;e was ordered directly, we drove of to Noi&s;y le Sec.</P>
<P>We walked about while dinner was preparing, and at a little di&s;tance ob|&s;erved a ca&s;tle, defended by a deep moat, great iron gates, a draw-bridge, and im|men&s;e high walls.&mdash;The appearance of this extraordinary man&s;ion, rou&s;ed my chivalry; I figured to my&s;elf a beaute|ous dam&s;el confined there by &s;ome hor|rid enchanter, or giant, and determined that I would, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;et the fair cap|tive
<PB N="211" REF="213">
free. Wil&s;on laughed at my ro|mantic ideas, but they had taken too &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me to be ea&s;ily baffled.</P>
<P>When we returned to our inn, we in|quired from our ho&s;t, who were the in|habitants of that Gothic fortre&s;s.&mdash;He told us they were two very beautiful young ladies, of high birth and large fortunes, who being determined never to marry, yet di&s;liking the &s;everities of a convent, had cho&s;e to &s;eclude them|&s;elves from the world in that retirement.</P>
<P>He added, that the curio&s;ity of all the neighbouring gentry, was &s;o highly rai&s;ed, that many attempts had been made to get a &s;ight of the&s;e fair reclu&s;es, but in vain; for no mortal had ever &s;een
<PB N="212" REF="214">
them, &s;ince their arrival there, though it was known they walked in their gardens every day.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity began now to operate upon Wil&s;on, as much as romance had done before on me, and we re&s;olved that we would take a peep at the&s;e voluntary vo|taries of Madam Diana, <HI>coute qui coute</HI>&mdash;Many and various were the &s;chemes which we framed, and rejected, for the gratification of our idle and impertinent inqui&s;itivene&s;s, during the cour&s;e of that night: we lay in the &s;ame room, in or|der to continue our con&s;ultations; but when the dawn appeared, we were ju&s;t as undetermined on what method to pur&s;ue, as we were at the moment we lay down.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215">We ro&s;e, and called our ho&s;t into council, who a&s;&s;ured us that the ca&s;tle was inacce&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s we were mad enough to venture our lives by &s;wim|ming over a deep fo&s;&s;&eacute;, which defended it in front, or &s;crambling through a thicket of briars, which prevented our approach on the other &s;ide; and that if we &s;hould even be able to &s;ubdue the&s;e difficulties, there was &s;till an immen&s;e high wall to climb, which no man could get over without hazarding life or limb.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition but increa&s;ed our ardor, and we at la&s;t re&s;olved to attempt the thicket, in preference to the fo&s;&s;&eacute;, as we thought we &s;hould make a better ap|pearance in the eyes of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed charmers, even with our cloaths torn, than after emerging dripping wet out of
<PB N="214" REF="216">
a dirty ditch.&mdash;And by the way, Lucan, I think that all the water in and about Paris, <HI>wants wa&s;hing,</HI> as was &s;aid once, by a witty friend of mine. I never &s;aw &s;uch a muddy puddle in my life, as their boa&s;ted Seine&mdash;The yellow Tiber, or the Bri&s;tol Severn, are cry&s;tal to it.</P>
<P>I will not detain you by repeating the fatigues and difficulties we &s;uffered, in this attempt; &s;uffice it to &s;ay that our cloaths were torn, and our hands, legs, and faces, as much &s;cratched, as if we had made a party on the pantiles with a groupe of amorous tabbies.&mdash;But what are not patience and per&s;everance able to &s;ubdue?</P>
<P>In &s;hort we &s;caled the walls, and &s;eated our&s;elves in a good plea&s;ant arbour, in
<PB N="215" REF="217">
a corner of the garden, valuing our&s;elves on our heroic achievement, and impa|tiently expecting the reward of our toils, by being ble&s;t at la&s;t with a view of the&s;e fair ve&s;tals.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after we had made our lodgment in this redoubt, to our inex|pre&s;&s;ible delight, we heard the &s;ound of female voices talking in a chearful lively tone; and &s;oon &s;aw two ladies walking towards us, down an alley that fronted the harbour we were in.</P>
<P>But no language will ever be able to de&s;cribe our amazement, when the &s;peak|ers had advanced near enough to be clearly &s;een, and di&s;tinctly heard by us.&mdash;No idea either of Venus or the Graces, or Diana and her Nymphs, will &s;uit the de&s;cription&mdash;But if you can rumage up
<PB N="216" REF="218">
any recollection of Cybele, or for that matter you need not go &s;o far back, as mother Shipton will &s;erve as well, to re|pre&s;ent the two old hags, that appeared then before us.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It mu&s;t be enchantment,"</Q> &s;aid I, to Wil&s;on.&mdash;He replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;ee nothing en|chanting about them; they are both ugly and old."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No woman is old in France, remember that, Wil&s;on; or at lea&s;t let us endeavour to per&s;uade the&s;e grannams that we think &s;o, for civility is the only pa&s;&s;port by which we can hope to get over the draw|bridge in &s;afety.</Q></P>
<P>When they approached the arbour, perceiving us they &s;tarted too, in their turn, and would have fled back, if their
<PB N="217" REF="219">
old &s;hanks had been &s;upple enough to have corre&s;ponded with their fears; but we &s;oon quieted their apprehen&s;ions, by the mildne&s;s of our demeanour, and the frank confe&s;&s;ion we made of the romantic curio&s;ity which had prompted us to this frolic.</P>
<P>Being thus recovered from this alarm, they both laughed immoderately at the aukward confu&s;ion which appeared in our faces; and one of them, addre&s;&s;ing us with infinite good humour and vi|vacity, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We are extremely obliged to you gentlemen, or rather <HI>courteous knights,</HI> for the perils you have encoun|tered, for our &s;akes; and al&s;o for convin|cing us that the noble &s;pirit of chivalry, is not yet quite extinct in the world. Be|lieve me, we wi&s;h rather more earne&s;tly
<PB N="218" REF="220">
than you, that we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e charms which you expected to have met with, in this galant adventure; but youth and beauty are tran&s;itory things, and with them we have lo&s;t the admiration of your &s;ex, and merely in &s;port had yet a mind to try if it was not &s;till in our power to occa&s;ion a di&s;appointment as great, though not indeed &s;o &s;evere, as any young and beautiful coquette might make her lover feel. If I may judge by your countenances, I think we have &s;o far &s;uc|ceeded; and the only amends we can make you, for having &s;ped our frolic, is to de&s;ire the favour of your compa|ny to dinner, and to promi&s;e to convey you back again, by a &s;horter and plea|&s;anter road than you came, to Noi&s;y le Sec, without any further damages than what the view of our per&s;ons &s;eems
<PB N="219" REF="221">
already to have made you pay for your peeping."</Q></P>
<P>You may &s;uppo&s;e how confoundedly &s;illy Wil&s;on and I looked all this while; but I was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the &s;pirit and good humour of this lively dowager, that I wi&s;hed her thirty years younger, intirely for her own &s;ake. We accepted her invitation with the be&s;t grace we could, and entered into a very chearful conver&s;ation with them both, during which they di&s;covered that we were Eng|li&s;hmen, and informed us, that they were our country-women. The one, who &s;eemed to take the lead in every thing, is a &s;i&s;ter of Lord D&mdash;'s, and had been, while &s;he lived in England, an intimate acquaintance of my mother's&mdash;Who the other lady was, did not tran&s;pire.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="222">Before we parted, Wil&s;on and I both promi&s;ed her not to di&s;clo&s;e their &s;ecrets, if &s;he cho&s;e to carry on the je&s;t for any further time; but &s;he gave us leave to publi&s;h it to our friends, if we plea&s;ed, as &s;he meant to quit that place immedi|ately; &s;aid &s;he and her companion were both tired of their voluntary confine|ment, and did not believe that, if they were to remain there &s;even years longer, any Frenchman would ever give him&s;elf as much trouble about them as we had had done.</P>
<P>I charged my&s;elf with &s;ome commi&s;|&s;ions, <HI>pour mes belles antiques,</HI> which I &s;hall execute in England with the mo&s;t <HI>knightly</HI> punctuality imaginable, and re|turned laughing to Paris, about an hour ago.&mdash;Robert is arrived with my bag|gage:
<PB N="221" REF="223">
I &s;hall dre&s;s and go to the Co|medie, though I believe it will be near over, before I get there.</P>
<P>As I am re&s;olved to attend Sir George Cleveland's motions, and that he &s;eems to be upon the wing, I &s;hall not expect to hear from you, while I remain upon the continent, but hope to find a pacquet from you, at my arrival in old England; till then, adieu, my dear Lucan, &s;ays</P>

&s;ay little of my&s;elf.&mdash;I am recovering from my late illne&s;s, though &s;lowly; Sir William is returned, in an alarming &s;tate; he fell from his hor&s;e, about a fortnight ago; his phy&s;ician apprehends that he has received &s;ome inward hurt, as he &s;pits blood ever &s;ince.&mdash;My attention to him is unremitted, he &s;eems plea&s;ed with it; and I begin once more to flatter my|&s;elf that my Fanny's prediction may yet be verified.</P>
<P>Colonel Walter has renewed his vi&s;it, and made &s;everal attempts to &s;peak to me alone, which I have happily evaded; for when I am ab&s;ent from Sir William, I take care to keep Harriet con&s;tantly with me&mdash;I perceive he is mortified at my caution, in which, however, I am deter|mined to per&s;evere.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227">La&s;t night, when our letters came from the po&s;t the Colonel took them from the &s;ervant, and conveyed one out of his pocket into the parcel: quick as his motions were, this action did not e&s;cape me; and the moment I had re|ceived tho&s;e that were addre&s;&s;ed to me, I retired, and immediately enclo&s;ed the letter which bore no po&s;t mark on it, in a blank cover, directed to the Colonel, and ordered it to be in&s;tantly delivered to him. When I returned into the par|lour to &s;upper, there were &s;trong traces of re&s;entment in his countenance, and he talked rather at, than to me, for the re|mainder of the evening.</P>
<P>This morning he went from hence, before I was up&mdash;Surely he will at length de&s;i&s;t from an hopele&s;s pur&s;uit&mdash;Twice

have his dete&s;ted and un&s;ucce&s;sful at|tempts brought me near the grave&mdash;Heaven pre&s;erve me from a third! I &s;hudder at the bare apprehen&s;ion!</P>
<P>Your wi&s;hes with regard to my becom|ing Harriet's confidante, are almo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed; for &s;he has confe&s;&s;ed to me that &s;he corre&s;ponded with Lord Lucan during my illne&s;s, and al&s;o that &s;he con|cealed my danger from him, as &s;he judged what his &s;ufferings would be, on that oc|ca&s;ion, by her own.&mdash;Was ever any thing more truly delicate, than her endeavour|ing to &s;ave him pain?</P>
<P>She offered to &s;hew me his letters; I refu&s;ed to &s;ee them, and told her I had no doubt of his friend&s;hip for me, or the propriety and politene&s;s of his
<PB N="227" REF="229">
manners towards her, but that I could not help ob&s;erving to her, as a friend, without the authority of a parent, that I feared there was &s;omething incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;trict rules of decorum, in her carrying on &s;uch a corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed extremely, and I could perceive there was &s;omething more &s;till labouring in her artle&s;s bo&s;om&mdash;Lord Lucan's picture came into my thoughts, at the &s;ame time, yet I had not re&s;olu|tion &s;ufficient to a&s;k her a &s;ingle que&s;tion relative to it.</P>

<P>I confe&s;s I am plea&s;ed at being able to acquit Lord Lucan of the indi&s;cretion of having made a confidante; his picture mu&s;t have fallen into the hands of Co|lonel Walter, when Harriet lo&s;t it, and the vile artful wretch contrived to place

<P>How to recover it for the innocent owner, is now the que&s;tion? I cannot think of any prudent, and therefore po&s;|&s;ible means, of effecting this, at pre&s;ent. I can neither a&s;k it as a favour, with a &s;afe conde&s;cen&s;ion, nor demand it as a right, without danger.</P>
<P>The variety of di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ubjects with which my late letters have been filled, have &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed my thoughts while writing to you, that I have never mentioned a circum&s;tance which has given me &s;incere &s;atisfaction, the recovery of Mr. Cre&s;well, Lucy Lei&s;ter's lover&mdash;His father is &s;ince dead, by which he is now be|come Sir Harry Cre&s;well&mdash;<HI>Ma chere amie</HI>

<P>PARIS &s;till, but on the point of quitting it, in a few hours.&mdash;My brother arrived here, on Sunday night, and with him&mdash;but no matter&mdash;He is not of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to interrupt a narrative in which we are all &s;o much intere&s;ted.&mdash;You may be curious tho'&mdash;Lord Hume then came with Sir George, from Naples! he has had a thou&s;and ridi|culous adventures in Italy&mdash;I have not &s;een him yet, and do not know when I &s;hall.</P>
<P>My eyes, as you apprehended, certain|ly told tales; for the moment Sir George &s;aw me, he &s;aid there is a glad expre&s;&s;ion in my &s;i&s;ter's face, that would almo&s;t
<PB N="237" REF="239">
tempt me to hope, beyond the bounds of rea&s;on; but, alas! Fanny, there is no redemption from the grave!</P>
<P>True, Sir George, I an&s;wered, but perhaps your trea&s;ure may not yet be con&s;igned to that &s;trong che&s;t.&mdash;He caught my hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his heart, cried out, it is impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould mean to trifle with my angui&s;h! Yet did &s;he not expire at Amiens?</P>
<P>She never was at Amiens, I replied&mdash;Where! where then did her pure &s;pirit take its flight, and quit her lovely form?&mdash;You mu&s;t be more compo&s;ed, Sir George, before I can talk further on this &s;ubject.&mdash;Why was it &s;tarted, Fanny? Why are my wounds all made to bleed afre&s;h? Can you delight in cruelty!</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="240">Far from it, you know how tenderly I &s;ympathized with your di&s;tre&s;s, when I believed her dead&mdash;If there is a cau&s;e in nature, that can make you doubt it now, O! &s;peak it quickly, and ea&s;e my anxious heart!</P>
<P>I have &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe &s;he lives, or I &s;hould not thus have alarmed you&mdash;My friend, Mrs Walter, has &s;een and conver&s;ed with a young lady, of the name of Delia Colville, in a convent at Saint Omer's, who may be her.</P>
<P>He dropped upon his knees&mdash;and ex|claimed&mdash;Gracious Heaven! but realize this ble&s;&s;ed vi&s;ion, let me no longer mourn my Delia's lo&s;s, and unrepining will I then &s;ubmit to all that fate or fortune can inflict upon my future days!
<PB N="239" REF="241">
Speak, &s;peak on, my &s;i&s;ter! and &s;ay again that you believe &s;he lives!&mdash;Indeed I do believe &s;o, my dear brother&mdash;He ro&s;e and caught me in his arms, while the large drops ran plenteous down his cheeks&mdash;Tears relieved us both.</P>
<P>I then proceeded to acquaint him with tho&s;e circum&s;tances which I have already informed you of; as I thought I might now venture to &s;peak to him with more certainty, and that I felt too much pain in keeping him longer doubtful&mdash;His tran&s;ports increa&s;ed, and it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to give any idea of the exce&s;s of his joy.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty I could prevent his going at midnight to Lord H&mdash;; but though I prevailed on him to defer his
<PB N="240" REF="242">
vi&s;it till morning, I could not per&s;uade him to go to bed, or attempt to take any re&s;t or food, except a little wine and water, and the whole night was &s;pent in repeating what I had told him before, and re-reading Mrs. Walter's letter.</P>
<P>Selfi&s;h mortal! as he is, he barely mentioned his having extricated Lord Hume out of &s;ome doleful di&s;a&s;ters, that befel him at Naples, in which an opera-&s;inger was the principal performer.&mdash;But what con&s;equence could he &s;uppo&s;e the &s;tory to be of, to me?</P>
<P>Though I neither am, or ever mean to be connected with his Lord&s;hip, I am plea&s;ed that my brother &s;aved his life, and that by his means he has got quit of an artful woman, who might pro|bably
<PB N="241" REF="243">
have ruined his fortune; and I have a kind of &s;atisfied pride al&s;o, in think|ing that he is &s;o much indebted to our family.</P>
<P>I am afraid there is &s;omething mean in the above reflection&mdash;but I am not now at lei&s;ure enough to trace it back to its &s;ource&mdash;at &s;ome other time I will fair|ly and philo&s;ophically inve&s;tigate its na|ture, and receive or reject it, according as I find it derived from a good or bad origin.</P>
<P>Long before the amba&s;&s;ador's &s;er|vants were &s;tirring, my brother attempted his door, and I think he returned three times before his excellency was vi&s;ible. As &s;oon as he had acquainted him with his bu&s;ine&s;s, Lord H&mdash; very obligingly
<PB N="242" REF="244">
&s;et out with him, for Ver&s;ailles, and has promi&s;ed to get the order for Delia's en|largement as much expedited as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>My brother, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, re|mains in waiting, till it is fini&s;hed, and is then to call on me, and fly to St. Omers, without &s;taying for the return of the chancellor's me&s;&s;enger from Tou|lou&s;e. I have &s;at all day in my travelling dre&s;s, as I would not delay him for any con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I mentioned your joy on the recovery of Delia; he returns your love, an hun|dred-fold, and &s;ays he will write both to you and Sir William, as &s;oon as his &s;pirits are a little more compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I fear to attempt an&s;wering my dear Loui&s;a's letter, at pre&s;ent, as I expect

<OPENER><DATELINE>St. Omers.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have been here three days, my head is &s;till giddy with the violent motion and emotion I have gone through, &s;ince I left Paris.&mdash;We &s;et out the moment I had &s;ealed my la&s;t letter to you, and travelled with as much expedition as French roads, hor&s;es, and po&s;t-boys would permit. Sir George
<PB N="244" REF="246">
was determined to &s;top at Amiens, and notwith&s;tanding the certain a&s;&s;urances I had given him that his Delia was alive, he &s;eemed to be &s;trongly agitated when we drove into the town.</P>
<P>He inquired from our landlord, whe|ther he recollected a young Engli&s;h lady's dying there, at &s;uch a time? And being an&s;wered in the affirmative, the colour for&s;ook his cheek, he fell almo&s;t lifele&s;s on a &s;ettee that was near him, and &s;ighed out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah Fanny! why have you deceived me!"</Q></P>
<P>I could not help being provoked at his weakne&s;s, and told him I did not know that he was to be a mourner for all the young Engli&s;h women that &s;hould die in France; that I was perfectly convin|ced
<PB N="245" REF="247">
Mi&s;s Colville was alive and well, or I &s;hould not have &s;et out on our pre&s;ent expedition; but if he was inclined to think otherways, he had better not pur&s;ue the journey any farther.</P>
<P>He replied, with his u&s;ual mildne&s;s&mdash;
<Q><L>" Who loves mu&s;t fear,</L>
<L>" And &s;ure who loves like me, mu&s;t greatly fear."</L></Q>
But my reliance on you has bani&s;hed my apprehen&s;ions, and I now only de|&s;ire to inquire into this affair, to know by what means Mrs. Colville could avail her&s;elf of a &s;tranger's death, to carry on the vile deceit &s;he has practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Our ho&s;t, like mo&s;t others, was very well inclined to be communicative, and informed us of the following particulars; that on &s;uch a day, the <HI>diligence</HI> that
<PB N="246" REF="248">
goes to Paris, &s;topped at his hou&s;e, and &s;et down a very pretty young woman, who was &s;o extremely ill, that &s;he was not able to travel farther; and that not|with&s;tanding all po&s;&s;ible care was taken of her, &s;he expired on the fourth day after her coming there.</P>
<P>They had di&s;covered before &s;he died, that &s;he was an Engli&s;h heretic, as &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to let any of their cler|gy attend her during her illne&s;s; but they knew not even her name, nor whom &s;he belonged to; and though her cloaths and effects were &s;ufficient to defray the expences of her funeral, yet as &s;he was not a catholic, &s;he could not be interred in con&s;ecrated ground; and mine ho&s;t, to u&s;e his own phra&s;e, &s;aid he was in a perfect quondary, to know how he &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="249">But as good luck would have it, a lady and her maid arrived at his hou&s;e the next day, in a po&s;t-chai&s;e&mdash;As they were Engli&s;h, he acquainted them with his di&s;tre&s;s; and the maid was &s;ent to look at the dead per&s;on, in order to know if &s;he could give any account of her&mdash;She returned to her mi&s;tre&s;s, and they were for &s;ome time &s;hut up together&mdash;At la&s;t the lady her&s;elf went to look at this lifele&s;s beauty, and the moment &s;he &s;aw her, &s;he gave a loud &s;cream, and ran back into her apartment.</P>
<P>Some time after, the maid called for him, and told him that it was her lady's daughter who had died there, and gave &s;ome hints of her having eloped from her friends&mdash;She de&s;ired that every thing might be prepared in the be&s;t manner,
<PB N="248" REF="250">
for &s;ending the body to England; and &s;trictly charged him not to let any per|&s;on go into the chamber where &s;he lay, but tho&s;e who were immediately con|cerned about the body.</P>
<P>She added, that he might di&s;po&s;e of the young lady's effects as he thought proper, except a &s;mall trunk, which con|tained only a miniature picture, a pocket book, and &s;ome letters; and the lady would pay all the nece&s;&s;ary expences on this melancholy occa&s;ion.&mdash;Every thing was then done as &s;he directed, to the mutual &s;atisfaction of mine ho&s;t, and that burier of the living and robber of the dead, Mrs. Colville.</P>
<P>I have not now lei&s;ure to expatiate on this extraordinary coincidence of circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="249" REF="251">
yet I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that fortune &s;eemed inclined to favour Mrs. Colville's deceit, by the particular &s;ituation of the young woman at Amiens, who&s;e inter|ment had impo&s;ed on all Delia's friends, even on her lover, and prevented any further inquiry about her.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay you are by this time very impatient to get us to our journey's end; but don't be in a hurry, Loui&s;a, for our ha&s;te in &s;etting out before the next day occa&s;ioned a very di&s;agreable delay, as it brought us to the gates of St. Omers, an hour after they were &s;hut, and obli|ged us to pa&s;s a mi&s;erable night, in what they call an <HI>auberge,</HI> but in our coun|try, I think it might more ju&s;tly be &s;tiled a barn.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="252">At la&s;t the wi&s;hed-for morning came, and we pur&s;ued our way directly to the convent.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to give you any idea of my brother's emotion&mdash;When we were &s;hewn into the parlour, I de&s;ired to &s;ee the &s;uperior&mdash;I know that I mu&s;t not &s;top here to give you a de&s;cription of her per&s;on, but indeed &s;he is a fine old lady.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he appeared, I delivered the king's mandate to her, which &s;he read with great dignity, but not with|out &s;urpri&s;e; and &s;aid if &s;he had been im|po&s;ed on, with regard to the young lady in que&s;tion, &s;he was not to blame; and added that &s;he was ready, on the in&s;tant, to obey the king's order, by delivering Mi&s;s Colville to my care.</P>
<P>Sir George in a tran&s;port exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me but &s;ee her, Madam"</Q>&mdash;There I
<PB N="251" REF="253">
interpo&s;ed my negative, for Delia's &s;ake, as I feared the effects which &s;o unexpected an interview might have upon her &s;pirits.&mdash;It was therefore at la&s;t agreed to that I &s;hould go into another parlour, &s;ee Mrs. Walter, and &s;end her to prepare De|lia for &s;uch a joyful event.</P>
<P>Our amiable friend &s;oon came to me, and I have the happine&s;s to tell you, that &s;he is mo&s;t wonderfully recovered; but, in pity to my brother's impatience, I &s;carce waited to inquire her health, be|fore I appointed her the me&s;&s;enger of glad tidings to our dear Delia.</P>
<P>She returned with her, in an in&s;tant; but when the lovely girl beheld me, &s;he could not &s;peak; &s;he made an effort to put her hand through the grate, and funk down on a chair that &s;tood near her&mdash;
<PB N="252" REF="254">
Tears came to her relief, and &s;he at la&s;t articulated, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O, my beloved Fanny! my more than <HI>&s;i&s;ter!</HI>"</Q> At <HI>that word</HI> &s;he blu&s;hed, and hid her face, as if to wipe away the tears.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly replied, you are, my dear, the &s;i&s;ter of my choice; and by that ten|der name, and for my brother's &s;ake, I beg you to compo&s;e your&s;elf&mdash;He is now in the hou&s;e, and mo&s;t ardently longs to &s;ee you, but mu&s;t not be indulged at the expence of injuring your health, by an increa&s;e of agitation&mdash;If you were calm, he &s;hould appear this moment.&mdash;I am quite calm, &s;he &s;aid, and fainted away.</P>
<P>I do not think I was ever &s;o terrified in my life&mdash;By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the nuns
<PB N="253" REF="255">
&s;he was brought to her&s;elf in about ten minutes, and, by the &s;uperior's permi&s;&s;ion, Sir George was admitted into the par|lour with me&mdash;I thought their meeting would have killed us all&mdash;Even an old nun wept, while &s;he admini&s;tered drops and water to the whole company.&mdash;I feel my&s;elf too much affected, even at this in&s;tant, to be able to repeat the no-con|ver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed at the time. Sir George embraced me, as if I had been his mi&s;tre&s;s, and Delia clung round Mrs. Walter's neck, calling her deliverer, guardian angel! &amp;c.</P>
<P>When our tran&s;ports had a little &s;ub|&s;ided, I propo&s;ed our adjourning to the inn, till we could be accommodated with private lodgings; for we had before agreed to wait the return of the chancel|lor's
<PB N="254" REF="256">
me&s;&s;enger at St. Omers, as it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that my brother &s;hould have a little re&s;t, after his fatigue both of mind and body&mdash;But he was not fated to ta&s;te repo&s;e as &s;peedily as I then hoped for.</P>
<P>I received Mi&s;s Colville in due form, from the hands of the &s;uperior, by whom many compliments and apologies were made to her late pri&s;oner.&mdash;Delia's beha|viour was charming, for in&s;tead of re|proaches for the &s;everity &s;he had &s;uffer|ed, &s;he returned thanks for the great care that had been taken of her, and took a mo&s;t polite and even affectionate leave of the whole community.</P>
<P>Mrs. Walter and Olivia accompanied us to the inn, and we pa&s;&s;ed the day in
<PB N="255" REF="257">
mutual congratulations, and in mora|lizing on the providential &s;eries of inci|dents that had procured Delia's deliver|ance&mdash;But towards evening we all per|ceived a vi&s;ible change in her coun|tenance, and before midnight there ap|peared &s;trong &s;ymptoms of a fever.</P>
<P>My brother was almo&s;t di&s;tracted; my heart bleeds for him&mdash;Should &s;he again be torn from his fond heart, I think it would be impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould &s;ur|vive the &s;econd blow&mdash;But I will hope the be&s;t&mdash;He has not gone to bed, &s;ince we left Paris; he never &s;tirs from the ante-chamber of the room where &s;he lies, and looks &s;o dreadfully, that I am &s;hock|ed at &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>The phy&s;icians here &s;ay that &s;he is not in danger, but they are &s;o mi&s;erably

<P>On the very day that we took her out of the convent, there came a letter from her mother, intreating the &s;uperior to &s;end Delia to &s;ome other nunnery, and charging her to deny her ever having been there, to any per&s;on who &s;hould in|quire after her.&mdash;Thank God, we have counter-acted her wicked &s;cheme, and I tru&s;t he will re&s;tore her to our prayers and wi&s;hes!</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="259">Again excu&s;e me, my Loui&s;a, for not entering upon the &s;ubjects mentioned in your la&s;t letter, as the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of our beloved brother, and adopted &s;i&s;|ter, engro&s;&s;es all my thoughts, and I can|not even allow a minute's attention to what appears a very extraordinary cir|cum&s;tance, which is Lord Hume's fol|lowing us from Paris, and lodging direct|ly oppo&s;ite to us, at St. Omers!

<P>OUR fears have been much increa&s;|ed for Delia's life, &s;ince I wrote la&s;t, but, thank Heaven, they are now happily over; her di&s;order turned out to be the mea&s;les: the phy&s;icians have pronounced her out of danger, and all our &s;pirits are attuned to the &s;weet har|mony of love and joy&mdash;If I had not been witne&s;s of them, I &s;hould not ea&s;ily have credited an account of the extravagan|cies which Sir George was guilty of, dur|ing her illne&s;s.</P>
<P>I find, Loui&s;a, that when the&s;e philo|&s;ophic gentlemen are thrown the lea&s;t
<PB N="260" REF="262">
out of their bias, they are not a bit more &s;teady than our&s;elves; and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hang up philo&s;ophy"</Q> &s;hould be the motto of them all, whenever their pa&s;&s;ions are thoroughly intere&s;ted.&mdash;But not to treat my brother too &s;everely, his was a very particular ca&s;e; and had his trea&s;ure been &s;natched from his arms, almo&s;t in the moment he had recovered it, the trial would, I think, have been too &s;evere for human fortitude.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger returned from Toulou&s;e while Delia was in the utmo&s;t danger; we did not therefore at that time trouble our&s;elves to inquire what Mrs. Colville had &s;aid, or done, on this extraordinary occa&s;ion; but we are &s;ince informed, that &s;he ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ts on her daugh|ter's being dead and buried, and denies
<PB N="261" REF="263">
her having placed her in the convent&mdash;It is &s;hocking to think how very near &s;he was to &s;peaking truth, at the very time &s;he uttered this fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>She &s;ent off another expre&s;s to the &s;u|perior of the Ur&s;ulines, with a letter to tell her, that more than her life depend|ed on her &s;teadine&s;s in denying her ever having received Delia into the convent; and promi&s;ing to give a thou&s;and guineas to the foundation, provided &s;he took care to &s;ecrete her effectually.</P>
<P>The good old lady has put this let|ter into my brother's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and he in return, has made a pre&s;ent to the &s;i&s;ter|hood of five hundred pounds.&mdash;This paper would be proof &s;ufficient again&s;t Mrs Colville, if we had not a &s;till more

<P>The moment her health is e&s;tabli&s;hed, we &s;hall return to England, and, notwith|&s;tanding my joy at her recovery, &s;hall quit St. Omers with regret, as I can|not prevail on my beloved Mrs. Walter to accompany us.&mdash;She and her &s;weet lit|tle girl are perfectly idolized in the con|vent; and I fear if Mrs. Walter's &s;itu|ation would admit of her taking the veil, that &s;he would certainly pa&s;s the remain|der of her days in that quiet a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>To prevent this, I wi&s;h long life to the mo&s;t worthle&s;s being upon earth&mdash;I &s;hould not &s;pecify Colonel Walter here, if Mrs. Colville were not alive.&mdash;I wi&s;h they were married together, and then I

<P>I hope by this time Sir William's re|covery has removed the anxiety you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily feel on his illne&s;s, and relea&s;ed you from a confinement that might po&s;|&s;ibly injure your health&mdash;Were it not for the&s;e con&s;iderations, I know of few of|fices more plea&s;ing than attending a per|&s;on we love, in &s;light di&s;orders&mdash;There is &s;omething extremely flattering to a generous mind, in the idea of admini&s;|tering relief to another's pains&mdash;To
<Q><L>" Explain the thought, explore the a&s;king eye!"</L></Q></P>
<P>What a delightful employment! and when crowned with &s;ucce&s;s by the reco|very
<PB N="264" REF="266">
of our patient, we are con&s;cious of a certain exultation in the mind, which can only ari&s;e from the certainty of hav|ing done what nature claims, and cha|rity enjoins.</P>
<P>I have of late experienced great plea|&s;ure in the execution of this duty, from my attendance on Mrs. Walter, and De|lia, and am therefore inclined to elevate the office of nur&s;e-tending, by placing it among&s;t our rational plea&s;ures, and re&s;cuing it from the mean character of one of the mere <HI>duties</HI> of life.</P>
<P>Yet I fear I &s;hall make but few con|verts to my opinion; e&s;pecially among&s;t the gay world, who, looking upon it in &s;uch a &s;ervile light, rank it with fa&s;ting, penitence and prayer; and too often po&s;tpone them together, till they may

<P>If Mi&s;s A&s;hford be a woman of &s;en&s;e, you run no hazard in tru&s;ting her with your opinion of Colonel Walter, though &s;he were ever &s;o much in love:&mdash;If &s;he be weak, &s;he &s;tands more in need of &s;uch a friendly warning; and if &s;he &s;hould break with you, in con&s;equence of it, I think you may ea&s;ily con&s;ole your&s;elf for the lo&s;s of &s;uch an acquaintance, by re|flecting that you acted from a &s;pirit of friend&s;hip, of which &s;he has &s;hewn her|&s;elf unworthy.</P>
<P>I perfectly approve of your conduct towards the per&s;on him&s;elf; and am, for your &s;ake, glad to exculpate Lord Lu|can

from the weakne&s;s, might I not add the di&s;honour, of having made a confi|dant.&mdash;What a charming girl is <HI>our</HI> Har|riet!&mdash;I mu&s;t call her &s;o; for indeed, I have a very great claim to her affection, from having, un&s;olicited, be&s;towed &s;o large a portion of mine on her, which I hope, when &s;he is Lady Lucan&mdash;don't &s;tart, Loui&s;a&mdash;and her heart quite at ea&s;e, &s;he will generou&s;ly repay.</P>
<P>Now, pray let me be indulged in talking a little of my&s;elf, <HI>et mon pauvre amant</HI> humili&eacute; <HI>et</HI> humiliant,&mdash;for I be|lieve one, and confe&s;s the other.&mdash;My brother has informed me of Lord Hume's mi&s;adventures at Naples; the particulars of which I &s;hall not trouble you with at pre&s;ent, as they are nothing different from the too general pranks and hazards of youthful &s;pirits, and may &s;erve us better
<PB N="267" REF="269">
to laugh at, on the fir&s;t <HI>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</HI> we may ever have the plea&s;ure of enjoying together.</P>
<P>I be&s;tow a generous wi&s;h that Sir George's notion about this matter may prove true; that as he has not only <HI>&s;een,</HI> but <HI>felt,</HI> his folly and extravagance, he may be more likely to act prudently, for the re&s;t of his life, than if he had never erred.</P>
<P>This is a maxim univer&s;ally propa|gated, and may in &s;ome in&s;tances be true; but I can &s;carce think it a &s;ufficient found|ation for a woman of &s;en&s;e, to build her happine&s;s on&mdash;To a man who has been accu&s;tomed to the artful blandi&s;hments of an abandoned woman, I &s;hould much fear that the delicate endearments of a
<PB N="268" REF="270">
wife would appear as ta&s;tele&s;s and in|&s;ipid, as true wit to the epigrammati&s;t, or the &s;weete&s;t viand to the &s;piced palate.</P>
<P>But all this is merely matter of &s;pecu|lation, and of no manner of con&s;equence to me; for Lord Hume has never yet attempted to pay me a vi&s;it, either at Paris, or here; and Sir George has not hitherto been in a &s;ituation to invite him, e&s;pecially as, from a very proper deli|cacy, he has never acquainted him with the circum&s;tances of Mi&s;s Colville's &s;tory; and though we &s;et out from Paris at the &s;ame time, he kept different &s;tages from us, all the way.</P>
<P>The account that my brother has ju&s;t given me of that particular, is this, that they had agreed at Naples, to travel to|gether
<PB N="269" REF="271">
to England, but on their arrival at Paris, and his hinting to him that I had come to meet him there, on account of &s;ome &s;ingular piece of bu&s;ine&s;s or other, he had immediately e&s;tranged him&s;elf from any further connection with him; &s;aying, after his lively manner, that as he looked upon him&s;elf to be in the nature of a <HI>redeemed knight,</HI> he thought it his bounden duty to attend his deli|verer, in the quality of an humble '&s;quire, till he had e&s;corted him &s;afe into his own country; but &s;hould wait upon him at &s;uch a re&s;pectful and unprying di&s;tance, as might leave the privacy, both of his conver&s;ation and tran&s;actions, perfectly free from any manner of re&s;traint.</P>
<P>My brother, you know, was abroad, when our affections commenced and
<PB N="270" REF="272">
grew together, while I was under the matronage of my aunt Marriot; when he returned, I had not courage enough to acquaint him with a &s;ecret, which would better have become Lord Hume him&s;elf to have informed him of, as they have ever lived on the mo&s;t friendly terms to|gether; and in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the affair, it would be extremely indi&s;|creet and ab&s;urd to breathe the lea&s;t hints of it now.</P>
<P>Our childi&s;h affections, as they mu&s;t naturally be formed without judgment, are generally unfortunate attachments, as they &s;ometimes leave &s;uch traces on the heart, as a long life of maturer rea&s;on can &s;carcely wear away; and to you I will not blu&s;h to own, that were it not for that fatal letter which Lord Hume wrote
<PB N="271" REF="273">
to me from Naples, and which is as in|delibly engraved on my heart as the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion he made there, I could again be weak enough, were he to &s;olicit it, to rea&s;&s;ume tho&s;e ro&s;y fetters which I fan|cied our juvenile hands had formed &s;uffi|ciently &s;trong to hold us both for life.&mdash;But that letter, Loui&s;a! I cannot forget it&mdash;I mu&s;t therefore try to forget the wri|ter of it!</P>
<P>I am, however, va&s;tly plea&s;ed with the delicacy of his pre&s;ent behaviour.&mdash;I told you, in my la&s;t, that he lodges oppo&s;ite to us; he is generally planted at his win|dow, but whenever I approach mine, he bows and retires immediately.&mdash;He has, it &s;eems, no kind of bu&s;ine&s;s in this place, but &s;tays here from the mere po&s;&s;ibility of his being in &s;ome degree, or by &s;ome
<PB N="272" REF="274">
chance or other, u&s;eful to my brother, to whom he thinks him&s;elf everla&s;tingly indebted for his kindne&s;s to him at Naples.</P>
<P>Gratitude cannot exi&s;t in a ba&s;e mind.&mdash;How then can gratitude and ingrati|tude &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame heart?&mdash;How can the &s;ame man run &s;o far in ar|rear to the account of love, and be &s;o ready to overpay the debt of friend&s;hip? Were he a man hackneyed in the ways of the world, I &s;hould not be &s;o much &s;ur|pri&s;ed at this incon&s;i&s;tency of charac|ter.</P>
<P>Men of galantry, I have heard, con|&s;ider women as bigotted catholics do heretics, and hold no faith with them;&mdash;And that &s;weet line which Shake&s;peare has put into the mouth of the innocent
<PB N="273" REF="275">
Juliet, is repeated, with perhaps an equal degree of contemptible exultation, by the abandoned courtier, and the apeing cit,
<Q><L>" At lovers perjuries, they &s;ay, Jove laughs."</L></Q>
But Lord Hume is young, and youth is the &s;pring of virtue; at lea&s;t it is the &s;ea&s;on when we are mo&s;t liable to feel
<Q><L>" The compunctious vi&s;itings of Nature,"</L></Q>
in con&s;equence of our tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing again&s;t her laws, by injuring the peace or hap|pine&s;s of others.</P>
<P>But I am my&s;elf tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing again&s;t her fir&s;t emotion, that of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, by dwelling on a &s;ubject which mu&s;t for ever be productive of pain, notwith|&s;tanding my repeated efforts to blunt the arrow's point.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="276">I congratulate you on the near pro|&s;pect of happine&s;s which opens to your friend, Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter&mdash;May it terminate in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all her wi&s;hes! I hope &s;he is by this time Lady Cre&s;well; and that my &s;weet little Harriet had the plea&s;ure and honour of being her para|nymph&mdash;I con&s;ider this office as a &s;tep to advancement, and I &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t young ladies are of my opinion, as they are generally very de&s;irous of it.</P>
<P>I think I have now, though &s;lightly, touched upon every article of your la&s;t letter; and I hope to find a pacquet from you, at my return to Dover-&s;treet, and that &s;oon, very &s;oon after, I &s;hall be able to give you an account of the joining of a pair, who&s;e hearts are, I believe, as firmly united, as any that ever took

<OPENER><DATELINE>St. Omers.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HERE I am, and here, like a fool as I am, I have been loitering, the&s;e three weeks, without any kind of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure to pur&s;ue, or even a creature to conver&s;e with, except hone&s;t old Saunders, who wonders mightily at my lord&s;hip, <HI>for pa&s;&s;ing my time &s;o lone|&s;omely,</HI> as he phra&s;es it.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="278">You will, perhaps, wonder too, till I inform you that I have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Fanny Cleveland, every day&mdash;Don't envy me, Lucan! for I am only permitted to gaze at her, acro&s;s the &s;treet, where we both live, at pre&s;ent&mdash;I wi&s;h I had a little of the fa&s;cinating power of the ba&s;ili&s;k in my eyes, that might make the dear girl throw her&s;elf into my arms; and may I peri&s;h if I would injure her, when &s;he was folded there.</P>
<P>But how came I here in the mid&s;t of my friends, alone, you'll be curious enough to a&s;k? To which I can make no other an&s;wer than to repeat the hint I gave you, from Paris, with regard to &s;ome my&s;tery or other, relative to Sir George's concerns. It cannot be any af|fair of galantry, or a &s;i&s;ter would not be
<PB N="277" REF="279">
his confidante&mdash;it cannot be a bu&s;ine&s;s of honour, or I &s;hould probably have been let into the &s;ecret&mdash;we may fairly conclude then, that it mu&s;t certainly be &s;ome &s;econd love engagement, or other, of difficulty, which his romantic punc|tilio may not leave him yet at liberty to divulge&mdash;For he appeared to be one of the <HI>knights of the &s;orrowful countenance,</HI> as well as your lord&s;hip, when I met him fir&s;t at Naples&mdash;However that matter may be, I have taken care, ever &s;ince his <HI>re&s;erved communication</HI> to me, never to di&s;tre&s;s him by my vi&s;its; and though we travel the &s;ame road together, I may be rather &s;aid to <HI>attend</HI> on, than <HI>accompany</HI> him, all the way.</P>
<P>I remember when my infatuation for Margarita was at the height, your
<PB N="278" REF="280">
telling me that I loved Fanny Cleve|land notwith&s;tanding&mdash;I was &s;urpri&s;ed at an a&s;&s;ertion then, which I now find to be true&mdash;But allowing this fact, which I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he mu&s;t be certain of, as well as you, by my hankering after her at this rate, and the timid re&s;pect I treat her with, from my window, which is directly oppo&s;ite to her's&mdash;
<Q><L>" Tell me my heart, if this be love."</L></Q>
Don't you think &s;he u&s;es me rather too &s;everely? But all lover's are unrea&s;on|able&mdash;and fal&s;e one's de&s;erve mortifi|cation.</P>
<P>Though perhaps it may be my own fault that I am kept thus aloof; for I am &s;uch a ba&s;hful penitent, that I have not courage enough to de&s;ire leave to
<PB N="279" REF="281">
wait on her, though &s;urely &s;ome favour|able interval might be contrived, even amid&s;t the occupation of the mo&s;t &s;ecret family intercour&s;e, to afford &s;ufficient lei&s;ure for the common decencies of friend&s;hip, or politene&s;s.</P>
<P>I would give any con&s;ideration that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;t interview was over, end as it may; but I do noturge it, though I am con|vinced that Sir George knows nothing, either of the engagements, or the breach, between his &s;i&s;ter and me&mdash;I wi&s;h I could pluck up heart of grace enough to tell him all about it. For, as I told you before, he is a very &s;en&s;ible man; and though he had lately &s;ome honour|able attachment or other, and may per|haps have entered into a new one &s;ince&mdash;without any manner of imputation&mdash;for
<PB N="280" REF="282">
con&s;tancy to the grave, is both madne&s;s and folly&mdash;yet I think it is at lea&s;t ten to one, that he has had &s;ome little <HI>gayet&eacute; de coeur,</HI> in the Margarita &s;tile, him&s;elf, at &s;ome time of his life, and therefore would not make &s;uch a fu&s;s about a man's having &s;trayed a little out of his road, on a common, as his prudi&s;h &s;i&s;ter might do, who to be &s;ure, like all other Dianas, &s;teers exactly by rule and compa&s;s.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you were here, this moment, to advi&s;e me how to conduct my&s;elf un|der my pre&s;ent difficulty, for I am in con|founded aukward circum&s;tances; and though you pretend to be a much mode&s;t|er youth than me, I will be hanged, were you in my &s;ituation, if you would not extricate your&s;elf much ea&s;ier than I can po&s;&s;ibly contrive to do.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="283">But whither has my former undaunted &s;pirit taken its flight to, of late? I had once the courage to give a bold affront, and yet tremble now at the ju&s;tice of a&s;king pardon for it&mdash;Thus con&s;cience, <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> Lucan, <HI>makes cowards of us all.</HI></P>
<P>If they get over to England before I have obtained leave to wait on Mi&s;s Cleveland, it is all over with me; for I may vi&s;it Sir George &s;even years, and never &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter. My la&s;t re&s;ource mu&s;t be to get into the &s;ame pacquet-boat with her, and pray mo&s;t devoutly for a good &s;torm, in our pa&s;&s;age, that we may be ca&s;t away, and that I may have an opportunity, like Jaffier&mdash;
<Q><L>" To &s;ave her life, with half the lo&s;s of mine!"</L></Q>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lord LUCAN to Lord HUME.</HEAD>
<P>I Received both your letters, my dear Hume, by the &s;ame pacquet, and as I think it much plea&s;anter to congratulate than condole, I &s;hall only reply to the la&s;t of them; for if you are, as I now be|gin to think, a true lover, your pre&s;ent happine&s;s mu&s;t have bani&s;hed every trace of your former di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>You have, indeed, my lively friend, been mightily indebted to chance, and I hope you will pardon me for &s;aying, that it has done more in your favour than you had any right to have hoped for&mdash;But you carele&s;s fellows &s;ometimes pro|fit more by getting into &s;crapes, than we &s;ober ones do by keeping out of them.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290">I think it requires the utmo&s;t effort of di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, not to envy you the happine&s;s of having been &s;ervice|able to the woman you love&mdash;And &s;uch a woman too! who&s;e generous nature can be &s;oftened into a forgivene&s;s of in|juries, by the &s;mall merit of having done an act, that any man in the world, though not a lover, would have been proud to have performed. But who is Delia Col|ville, pray? This is another per&s;onage added to your former drama&mdash;being her fir&s;t appearance on the &s;tage&mdash;But &s;he mu&s;t be the new mi&s;tre&s;s of Sir George, I &s;uppo&s;e, whom you hinted at before, and &s;o that my&s;tery is unravelled at la&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Helas! que mon &s;ort e&s;t plus bizarre</HI>&mdash;The object of my adoration has been ill, dangerou&s;ly ill, for &s;ome time; and I
<PB N="289" REF="291">
have not even dared to expre&s;s my &s;or|row for her &s;ufferings, or relieve my anxiety by ince&s;&s;ant and minute inqui|ries about her health&mdash;We are many, many miles, a&s;under, almo&s;t at the oppo|&s;ite extremes of this kingdom; and I am debarred even the poor indulgence of lamenting by &s;ecret corre&s;pon|dence, the pangs I hourly feel from ab|&s;ence&mdash;But &s;he is the ruler of my de&s;ti|ny, and I will not murmur or repine at whatever &s;he &s;hall ordain.</P>
<P>Do I not then de&s;erve that chance or fortune &s;hould do &s;omething in favour of &s;uch an humble and patient &s;ufferer, as I am?&mdash;Yet what can it do for me! circum&s;tanced as my unhappy pa&s;&s;ion is, it mu&s;t be criminal even to hope that tho&s;e in&s;uperable bars which now

<P>I have received an invitation to attend the nuptials of an intimate friend of mine, who has been long in love with a very amiable young woman, but till now, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"With-held by parents."</Q>&mdash;Though utterly unfit for any &s;cene of fe&s;tivity, I cannot refu&s;e this &s;ummons, as I am truly intere&s;ted in the happine&s;s both of the bride and bridegroom&mdash;I &s;hall, therefore, &s;et out immediately for Dublin.

a few miles from it; but di|rect to me there.</P>
<P>And if you have yet de&s;cended from your hyperbolical heights, pray let me have a &s;imple news-paper paragraph about the fire, and the facts that at|tended it. Your hopele&s;s &s;tate has been bettered, I find, by the &s;ame unnatural means that the wretched farmers of this country u&s;e with their land; when their crops begin to grow thin, they burn it. But you are a lucky fellow in every thing&mdash;Even your ill behaviour to Mi&s;s Cleveland, turns out now to your ad|vantage&mdash;A woman affords an irrefra|gable proof of her love, who forgives &s;uch an affront; for if &s;he does, believe me, that 'tis her own pa&s;&s;ion, not your chivalry, that has recovered her to you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVI.</HEAD>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Elm grove near Dublin.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THANK you, my Fanny, for the plea&s;ure I have received from all your letters, but particularly for the la&s;t, which announces the glad tidings of Delia's recovery, of my brother's ap|proaching happine&s;s, and of your return to England.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee, by the date of this, that I have made an excur&s;ion from South|field, &s;ince my la&s;t&mdash;Sir William, who is now, I hope, in a fair way of recovery, has at la&s;t con&s;ented to Lucy's mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t and repeated reque&s;t, and has kindly permitted me to attend her nup|tials
<PB N="293" REF="295">
&mdash;He intends to pa&s;s the time of my ab&s;ence with Colonel Walter&mdash;I am &s;orry he has cho&s;en him for his companion, but what arguments could I oppo&s;e to his inclinations?</P>
<P>On my arrival in Dublin, ye&s;terday morning, I was met by my beloved Lucy, and her beloved lover&mdash;I never &s;aw de|licate happine&s;s &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon elegant features, as it appeared in both their countenances; yet there was a little mixture of timidity in Lucy's eyes, which abated their vivacity, but encrea&s;ed that charming look of &s;en&s;ibi|lity which is the natural re&s;ult of refined tenderne&s;s&mdash;the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible of female charms.</P>
<P>Harriet, who came with me, is in high &s;pirits; &s;he is to have the honour
<PB N="294" REF="296">
you wi&s;hed her, of being bride-maid, on this occa&s;ion&mdash;Young girls are always delighted at the pro&s;pect of a wedding, and con&s;ider that mo&s;t &s;olemn and hazardous act of our lives merely as a fe&s;tival&mdash;When, alas!&mdash;But this wedding will, I hope, and believe, ju&s;|tify their opinion, and make a holiday for both their lives. Amen, I&s;ay, with all my heart!</P>
<P>Mrs. Layton, Lucy, Harriet, and I, came here ye&s;terday, in my coach. This morning I have been all about the place, and never &s;aw a &s;weeter &s;pot; the pro&s;|pects are delightful; there is an ample view of the bay of Dublin, and of the oppo&s;ite hills, which for many miles are richly cultivated and adorned with numberle&s;s gardens and villas&mdash;There
<PB N="295" REF="297">
is nothing in the environs of London, half &s;o beautiful; as neither the Thames or Medway, can pretend to vie, in beauty or in grandeur, with the ocean.</P>
<P>This lovely &s;eat Sir Harry Cre&s;well has ju&s;t purcha&s;ed, and &s;ettled it as a jointure hou&s;e, on my fair friend; leav|ing his family-man&s;ion to de&s;cend in the u&s;ual cour&s;e, to his heirs male.&mdash;I am plea&s;ed with the propriety and delicacy of this action, as I have always thought it extremely cruel that a woman &s;hould be obliged to quit her hou&s;e, on the death of her hu&s;band, and be as it were turned adrift in the world, at the time &s;he has lo&s;t her chief &s;tay and &s;upport in it.</P>
<P>Sir Harry is to dine with us here, this day, and to go back to Dublin,
<PB N="296" REF="298">
which is ju&s;t &s;ix miles off, at night: to|morrow he returns here again, to part from his Lucy no more. The ceremo|ny is then to be performed in a neat private chapel within the deme&s;ne&mdash;Mi&s;s Cre&s;well, a &s;i&s;ter of Sir Harry's, is to be the other bride-maid; and his bride-men, whoever they are to be, will I &s;uppo&s;e, attend him hither.</P>
<P>I hear a carriage driving furiou&s;ly, and am not yet dre&s;&s;ed&mdash;It mu&s;t be Sir Harry&mdash;Lovers are impatient&mdash;'Tis he, indeed; but can I believe my &s;ight? Lord Lucan with him! My fate pur|&s;ues me! O Fanny! I can write no more.</P>
