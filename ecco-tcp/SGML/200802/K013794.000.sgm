<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Age of <HI>Theatric change,</HI> when TRAGEDIES have found them&s;elves to be COMEDIES, and CO|MEDIES have bordered upon PANTOMIME; nothing has changed &s;o little as <HI>Pantomime</HI> it&s;elf. <HI>Harle|quin</HI> &s;kips away his Pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;<HI>Colombine</HI> foots it to the &s;ame Tune;&mdash;the cho&s;en <HI>Lover</HI> &s;lides acro&s;s the Stage, melancholy and gentlemanlike;&mdash;the <HI>Clown</HI> breaks his Head plea&s;antly again&s;t the Scene, and the <HI>Father</HI> tumbles over him, in the &s;ame Way, and fortunately with the &s;ame Merriment, he has done any Time the&s;e Hundred Years.</P>
<P>The&s;e Wittici&s;ms are certainly good ones, for they are undoubtedly the olde&s;t, and of the longe&s;t &s;tanding of any in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>But one Je&s;t cannot unfortunately live for ever. In the Ea&s;t Indies, the &s;ame Joke la&s;ts only a Twelvemonth, and is terminated by the Arrival of the next Ships.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, the Author of the Pantomime, in which the following Songs bear a Part, has attempted to &s;tray from the beaten Road; but it is reque&s;ted the Audience will not be alarmed. The
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
Hero of to Night is not about to be a Man of Sentiment; tho' <HI>Othello</HI> might be &s;uch with a black Face, he had not the good, or the ill Fortune, to have a Party-colour'd Jacket, which cuts &s;hort all Sen|timent at once.</P>
<P>The Novelty attempted to be dramati&s;ed To-night, takes its Ri&s;e from the Writings of MISS AIKIN, and the HON. HORACE WALPOLE. The <HI>Ca&s;tle of Otranto,</HI> and <HI>the Fragment of Sir Bertrand,</HI> form the Ba&s;is of an Endeavour to bring upon the Stage &s;omewhat of the Effects which may be pro|duced by Midnight Horror, and Agency &s;uper|natural. What may be the Re&s;ult of this Experi|ment, To-night mu&s;t determine, for hitherto the Experiment has not been made.</P>
<P>The Gho&s;t of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and the Witches of <HI>Mac|beth</HI> do not militate again&s;t this A&s;&s;ertion. Their Appearance, tho' out of Nature, was &s;imple and not combined. The Clank of Chains, the Whi&s;tling of hollow Winds, the Clapping of Doors, Gigantic Forms, and vi&s;ionary Gleams of Light, attended not their Effects upon the Stage. The firm Mind certainly may laugh at all this; but if ever, on a late Winter Evening, at a well-told Story of an Appari|tion, the Company have found them&s;elves unu&s;u|ally attentive, and &s;ometimes unwittingly look'd back;&mdash;if they have felt no Wi&s;h to part;&mdash;if imper|ceptibly they have &s;at more clo&s;ely together, and heard the Summons to Re&s;t and Separation,&mdash;the retiring to a lone Chamber with Reluctance, not
<PB N="v" REF="5">
to &s;ay Di&s;quietude;&mdash;if all this has happen'd, then are we right in thinking there is &s;omewhat of En|thu&s;ia&s;m, or Super&s;tition in the&s;e Matters, which Rea&s;on &s;miles at, but cannot prevail over.&mdash;</P>
<P>If this is a Weakne&s;s, the greate&s;t and the be&s;t of all Times have felt its Force;&mdash;<HI>Henry the Fourth,</HI> the great <HI>Duke of Marlborough,</HI>&mdash;and a Family of Rank in this Country, with whom the Author has had the Honor of being intimate, were remar|kable In&s;tances of this Truth.</P>
<P>Mix'd up with lighter Things to counteract the Gloom, &s;ome Grains of this Species of Compo&s;ition will form the Potion of the Pantomime in Que&s;tion; in other Matters the Author humbly hopes he &s;hall not be more dull than his Neighbours have been before him: perhaps quite as non&s;en&s;ical, and &s;ometimes more ab&s;urd.&mdash;He tru&s;ts, however, the Audience will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with him, for having &s;ub&s;tituted a <HI>talkative Attendant</HI> upon <HI>Har|lequin</HI> in the room of the u&s;ual <HI>Dumb Grimace</HI> of the <HI>Clown,</HI> or having given them the youthful Accom|pli&s;hments of Mi&s;s WILKINSON as a <HI>Colombine</HI> in the Place of a <HI>Figurante.</HI></P>
