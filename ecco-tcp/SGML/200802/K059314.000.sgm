<HEAD TYPE="sub">In thee the Fatherle&s;s findeth Mercy.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST all tho&s;e virtues and perfections which con|tribute to the lu&s;tre and dignity of human nature, <HI>Charity</HI> hath ever held the fir&s;t and mo&s;t exalted &s;tation; as the be&s;t and true&s;t repre&s;entative of the mo&s;t high God, his Vice-gerent upon earth, commi&s;&s;ion'd, as it were, by him to remove the wants, &s;often the calamities, and mitigate the &s;orrows of mankind.</P>
<P>The age we live in can not&punc; I fear, with any propriety be &s;til'd the age of wit or wi&s;dom, of learning, piety or virtue: but it may perhaps not unde&s;ervedly be called the age of charity; never was there a time wherein &s;o many ho&s;pitals, &s;chools and foundations have been rai&s;ed and &s;upported among&s;t us: it is indeed a&s;toni&s;hing, when we con&s;ider the variety of channels through which our bounty hath flowed, to reflect how full the current is in every one of them; but what can not the gracious providence of God maintain and pre&s;erve! the &s;ame divine power which &s;o marvellou&s;ly filled the widow's crui&s;e of oil hath
<PB N="6" REF="5">
from time to time &s;upply'd and repleni&s;h'd this perennial foun|tain; this copious &s;tream &s;till glideth thro' our fertile &s;oil, <HI>ble&s;&s;eth the earth with her increa&s;e,</HI> and <HI>watereth the furrows thereof.</HI></P>
<P>In obedience to the commands of our great Lord and ma&s;ter, who &s;o frequently recommends the poor and de&s;erted to our care and protection, <HI>Charity-&s;chools,</HI> for the maintenance and protection of indigent children, have been erected, and liberally &s;upported in every part of this kingdom, and the good effects of them are univer&s;ally felt and acknowledged: but in every human in&s;titution, there mu&s;t be &s;ome human, weakne&s;s, &s;ome mark of the imperfection of our nature; in a nation like ours, and more e&s;pecially in the great center of it, there mu&s;t always be a perpetual vici&s;&s;itude of manners; new accidents, new vices and follies will produce new wants and calamities, which will con&s;equently require new re&s;ources to guard again&s;t, or remove them: large, numerous and exten&s;ive, therefore, as our charity-&s;chools were, they have been found in &s;ome mea&s;ure inadequate to the purpo&s;es for which they were de&s;igned, and objects have of late years pre&s;ented them&s;elves which even this wide circle of benevolence cou'd not comprehend: they did not (cou'd not indeed from the nature of their con&s;titution) comprehend a &s;et of helple&s;s and mi&s;erable beings, excluded by their peculiarly unhappy circum&s;tances from the benefit of every public in&s;titution, barren and leafle&s;s branches, cut off, as it were, from the tree of life, which, deprived of all moi&s;|ture and nouri&s;hment, mu&s;t inevitably wither and decay: the&s;e principally con&s;i&s;ted of ORPHAN and DESERTED GIRLS,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
who, after wandering about for a time in the utmo&s;t mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;oon peri&s;hed with hunger, or, which was &s;till more to be lamented, fell an early &s;acrifice to vice, infamy, and pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>An evil &s;o dreadful and &s;o alarming called for a &s;peedy and effectual remedy, as the effects of it were becoming every day and every hour more fatal to &s;ociety: when it plea&s;ed the gracious providence of God to in&s;pire the brea&s;ts of a few <HI>&s;earchers after Good</HI> with the de&s;ign of erecting an ASYLUM for the&s;e wretched outca&s;ts, a haven of re&s;t and &s;afety from the cruel &s;torms of this world which beat &s;o hard upon them; this truly noble and benevolent purpo&s;e was immediately put in execution, and hath, by the prudent oeconomy of its direc|tors, and the liberal bounty of the &s;ub&s;cribers to it, been enabled to bani&s;h all tho&s;e evils which it was meant to re|move, and to an&s;wer every good end which it was intended to promote.</P>
<P>To bring good out of evil, to render the mi&s;eries and di&s;|&s;tre&s;&s;es of mankind, productive of virtue and happine&s;s, is doubtle&s;s one of the noble&s;t acts which human wi&s;dom can contrive, or human power can execute, as it is the neare&s;t and mo&s;t exact imitation we can a&s;pire to of the Divine Being. That this is mo&s;t evidently the de&s;ign and endeavour of that amiable charity which I am here called upon to recommend, will appear indi&s;putable to every impartial mind, that &s;hall but for a moment reflect on the few following particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
And fir&s;t then,</P>
<P>The principal and peculiar recommendation of this excellent charity is, that here <HI>the fatherle&s;s findeth mercy.</HI> All the&s;e unfortunate little ones whom you now &s;ee before you, are ORPHANS; and &s;urely a more melancholy or di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tance cannot be conceiv'd; left in their tender infancy to the mercy of a cruel multitude, and the bad examples of a licentious age; without a parent to guide or in&s;truct them, without a &s;hepherd to <HI>feed them in green pa&s;tures,</HI> or <HI>lead them be&s;ide the waters of comfort;</HI> this, my brethren, is <HI>a voice crying in the wilderne&s;s</HI> which we mu&s;t all hear; this is a call on our humanity, which we can never re&s;i&s;t; tho&s;e to whom God hath graciou&s;ly continued the life of their parents, &s;en&s;ible of &s;o ine&s;timable a ble&s;&s;ing, mu&s;t feel for, and compa&s;&s;ionate the wretched beings who are depriv'd of it; and, on the other hand, if there are now before me, as I doubt not but there are, &s;ome who &s;till lament a father's care, or bewail a lo&s;t mother's tenderne&s;s, they, I am &s;atisfy'd, will anticipate every thing that could be urged in their favour, they will reflect and con&s;ider, what a mi&s;erable, what a deplorable condition tho&s;e mu&s;t be in, who are deprived of this, and withal, of every other con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Parents, we know, there have been, and to this day are, &s;o totally void of all feeling and humanity, as even to de&s;troy their own offspring: can we wonder then to hear of others, who, in oppo&s;ition to the dictates of nature, totally de&s;ert and for&s;ake them? &s;uch was the wretched and truly pitiable condition of many, whom this ASYLUM hath relieved: it hath indeed &s;ometimes happened, that the&s;e mi&s;erable ORPHANS
<PB N="9" REF="8">
were left in their tender infancy, by parents who could not po&s;&s;ibly avoid it: their fathers have been hurried from them by cruel nece&s;&s;ity, or perhaps peri&s;hed abroad in the &s;ervice of their country, whil&s;t their unhappy mothers have fallen a &s;a|crifice to di&s;ea&s;e and penury at home; thus doth this u&s;eful charity, whil&s;t it relieves <HI>private</HI> di&s;tre&s;s, promote <HI>public</HI> hap|pine&s;s, and di&s;charge the debt of gratitude, which &s;ociety owes to the indu&s;trious parent, by that &s;upport and protection which it affords to his afflicted <HI>Child.</HI></P>
<P>But the children educated in the ASYLUM are not only ORPHANS, but what will render them &s;till more proper objects of our compa&s;&s;ion, <HI>Female</HI> ORPHANS. The mo&s;t powerful argument in favour of this excellent in&s;titution is doubtle&s;s its amiable partiality to that &s;ex which ever lays &s;o warm, &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible a claim to our &s;upport and protection: a &s;ex by nature left more weak and defencele&s;s than our own, liable to more dangers and temptations, le&s;s able to &s;truggle with difficulties, or to oppo&s;e the malice and &s;ubtlety of a corrupt and de&s;igning world. The female mind is formed in a &s;oft and tender mold, peculiarly &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions, and as remarkably tenacious of them: how much then doth it import their future happine&s;s, that the fir&s;t which they re|ceive &s;hou'd be fair and good, and that to keep the waters from corruption, they &s;hould be &s;weet and untainted at the foun|tain!</P>
<P>Beauty, we know, is an univer&s;al light, it &s;hineth, like the &s;un, with equal lu&s;tre on the palace and the cottage: it is
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the free gift, the patrimony, as it were, of beneficent nature, who di&s;pen&s;es her bounties to all her children without regard to rank or condition: but beauty, as experience teaches us, is &s;ometimes a dangerous and fatal pre-eminence; all the ad|vantages of birth and education, have proved in&s;ufficient to &s;ave the di&s;tingui&s;hed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it from ruin and de&s;truc|tion: even where parents have been near to guard, and friends to admoni&s;h, too often hath it fallen a &s;acrifice to the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, or the arts of the betrayer; but if affluence and knowledge are en&s;nared, how &s;hall poverty and ignorance e&s;cape? it is ever a maxim with the wicked that guilt like &s;or|row is lighten'd by participation, and that a companion in our crimes will palliate and dimini&s;h the iniquity of them; hence it ari&s;eth that the pro&s;titute and abandon'd part of the &s;ex, are ever active and vigilant to &s;educe the young and in|nocent, and lead them into the paths of vice and folly; to what certain, what unavoidable mi&s;ery then mu&s;t be expo&s;ed tho&s;e unhappy females who are left in their tender years to all the &s;nares and temptations, all the arts and &s;eductions of the profligate and de&s;igning! the arrows of misfortune are in their &s;ides, they are marked out as it were from the herd, for immediate de&s;truction, and fly like &s;tricken deer to the ASYLUM's friendly covert, to hide them&s;elves from their cruel pur&s;uers, vice, infamy, and ruin. In behalf of objects like the&s;e, I need not, I am &s;atisfied, addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who are of the &s;ame &s;ex with them&s;elves: your &s;ympathetic hearts, untaught and unin&s;tructed, will dictate all that can be &s;aid, and all that can be done: as women you will pity
<PB N="11" REF="10">
them, as mothers you will feel for them, as Chri&s;tians you will, I doubt not, contribute to relieve and &s;upport them.</P>
<P>But, that we may view this noble &s;tructure in every light that can be&s;t di&s;play its beauty, &s;ymmetry and proportion, let us con&s;ider what benefits and advantages may ari&s;e to the Community from this excellent in&s;titution: let us con&s;ider that the ASYLUM, in grateful return for that &s;upport and protection which it receiveth from us, may, and already hath produced a number of indu&s;trious, con&s;cientious and faithful &s;ervants: a circum&s;tance in which our dome&s;tic ea&s;e and happine&s;s is nearly and intimately concerned; never perhaps was there a time when they were more wanting than at pre|&s;ent, owing, no doubt, to that univer&s;al &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ipation, that reigning love of plea&s;ure, that impatience of labour and re&s;traint which hath of late &s;pread it&s;elf thro' all ranks and degrees: whil&s;t tho&s;e accept the office of &s;ervants who are either unable or unwilling to perform it, the evil I fear mu&s;t continue; how valuable therefore, and how truly laudable is an in&s;titution which tends to remove &s;o general a calamity, which teaches the children entru&s;ted to its care (and that at an age when they are mo&s;t capable of learning) every u&s;eful branch of hou&s;hold oeconomy, in&s;tructs them in every thing that they <HI>ought</HI> to know, and, which is perhaps peculiar to this charity, in nothing which they ought <HI>not!</HI></P>
<P>Many of our charities, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, have erred greatly in this important particular: with parental affection
<PB N="12" REF="11">
they have adopted parental weakne&s;s al&s;o; have counteracted their own de&s;igns, and by exce&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s and indulgence ruin'd tho&s;e unfortunate beings whom they meant to pre&s;erve; too much care hath frequently been taken of their intellects and too little of their morality; and their education been thus render'd too exten&s;ive and exalted for that rank and &s;ituation in life which they were de&s;igned for: an error which our ASYLUM hath mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly endeavour'd to avoid; we imitate not the boa&s;ted &s;eminaries of the Romi&s;h church, where the moment their reclu&s;e votaries are &s;et apart for the &s;ervice of God, they become u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ociety: whil&s;t ours, on the other hand, are taken <HI>from</HI> the world, only that they may be of the greater &s;ervice <HI>to</HI> it; remov'd from the vices and temptations, and at the &s;ame time reaping all the ad|vantages, participating the improvements, and practi&s;ing the duties and relations of public life.</P>
<P>It is with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction I have heard, that many of the children here educated, have by their extra|ordinary indu&s;try and application, by &s;obriety, decency, and every method in their power, endeavour'd to repay the goodne&s;s of their benefactors; a circum&s;tance very proper to be menti|oned on this occa&s;ion, as it reflects honour on the mi&s;tre&s;s who in&s;tructs them, on the governours who pre&s;ide over this charity, and indeed on every per&s;on who contributes towards the maintenance and &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>When the&s;e, thus happily, thus &s;ea&s;onably, protected ORPHANS, &s;hall leave their retreat, and come out into the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
world, when experience &s;hall have taught them, what &s;nares they have avoided, what dangers they have been protected from; when they &s;hall &s;ee how many of their unhappy fellow|creatures, perhaps the companions of their infancy, for want of this kind &s;helter, have fallen an ea&s;y prey to vice, and &s;unk into the loath&s;ome aby&s;s of &s;in and mi&s;ery; how will their hearts overflow with gratitude to their generous patrons, with what eyes of tender acknowledgement, and heart-felt &s;atis|faction will they look back on the&s;e delightful &s;eats of in|nocence and peace!</P>
<P>Here they are &s;heltered from the world, before they can po&s;&s;ibly have received any fatal infection from it; before the &s;oft wax can have taken any bad impre&s;&s;ion: their duty towards God, towards their benefactors, towards the community to which they belong, are here the fir&s;t things they learn, and con&s;e|quently &s;tand the faire&s;t chance of being the la&s;t things which they will forget; tho&s;e can never be bad &s;ervants who are good women, and pious Chri&s;tians: &s;uch, (and &s;uch only we endea|vour to &s;end out) will be indu&s;trious from habit, &s;ober from example, virtuous from principle, hone&s;t and faithful from con&s;cience, and from Religion.</P>
<P>To Religion indeed, that noble&s;t foundation of every good, we doubtle&s;s owe our great, and, I may perhaps add almo&s;t unparallell'd &s;ucce&s;s; <HI>except the Lord build the hou&s;e, their labour is but lo&s;t that build it; except the Lord keepeth the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.</HI> Charity, we know, is the natural offspring of devotion, and love of man &s;pringeth from the love of God. To the erection and enlargement of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Chapel.</NOTE> <HI>this &s;truc|ture</HI> we are, I am &s;atisfy'd, indebted in a great mea&s;ure for the
<PB N="14" REF="13">
encrea&s;e and enlargement of tho&s;e <HI>frequent and liberal</HI> contri|butions which have enabled us to &s;upport it; from this foun|tain of living waters have flowed all tho&s;e refre&s;hing &s;treams of benevolence, that from time to time have water'd our fertile garden; and whil&s;t the word of God is here preached, as it hath hitherto been, in purity, truth, and &s;implicity, without ornament, pomp or parade, untinctur'd by modern o&s;tentation, and unleavened by modern enthu&s;ia&s;m, the ob|jects of our care and attention, will I doubt not, continue to reap the ble&s;&s;ed fruits of it.</P>
<P><HI>The Lord,</HI> we read in Scripture, <HI>was with Jo&s;eph, and all that he did pro&s;pered in his hand:</HI> the Lord we tru&s;t, my bre|thren, is with <HI>us</HI> al&s;o: thanks be to the great giver of every good gift, our &s;ucce&s;s has exceeded even our fonde&s;t hopes, and our mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes cou'd &s;carce have formed a more delightful pro&s;pect than that which is now before us: the duty therefore, of this day, ari&s;eth from the united prin|ciples of gratitude and benevolence; we a&s;&s;emble in this place to return our unfeigned thanks for pa&s;t mercies, and to implore the continuance of divine favour; the heat and labour of the war is over, and we meet in joy to celebrate our victory, the noble&s;t of all victories, a victory over the human heart, over the &s;elfi&s;h cruel pa&s;&s;ions of avarice and inhumanity: may the triumphs we already boa&s;t be the harbingers of more ex|ten&s;ive conque&s;ts &s;till behind, and our pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;s prove the au&s;picious omen of future pro&s;perity!</P>
<P>Let us then with an eye of plea&s;ure and complacency con|template the beautiful picture that is now before us: let us behold Benevolence &s;urrounded by her attendant virtues, admini&s;tering to the nece&s;&s;ities, and cultivating the minds
<PB N="15" REF="14">
of the&s;e happy children: temperance pre&s;ides over their meals, humility cloaths, indu&s;try in&s;tructs, and mode&s;ty adorns them: the&s;e are the matrons that &s;uperintend, the&s;e are the guardians that watch over and protect them: the&s;e will plead &s;trongly for the precious charge entru&s;ted to them; the&s;e, we tru&s;t, will intercede for their beloved care, will &s;often the hearts of the obdurate, open the hand of the tenacious, and melt even the mo&s;t unfeeling into tenderne&s;s and commi&s;eration.</P>
<P>True charity, my brethren, like true beauty, wants not the paint of art to &s;et off, or the gorgeous robes of flattery to adorn her; to be di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;he need but to be &s;een, to be admired, &s;he need but to be known: I have only endeavoured to point her out unto you, and may venture to leave the re&s;t to your own generous hearts: many perhaps there may be, many I doubt not but there are now before me, whom a larger &s;hare of the good things of this world hath rendered more able, many whom the grace of God, joined to their own &s;erious reflections, hath made more willing than ever they were before, to <HI>di&s;tribute;</HI> many there are who wait but to know to <HI>whom they &s;hould do good,</HI> before they do it; &s;uch, I am &s;atisfy'd, the little imperfect &s;ketch, which I have drawn of this in&s;titution, will induce to contribute towards its maintainance and &s;upport.</P>
<P>Among&s;t all the fair daughters of charity, tho&s;e <HI>poli&s;hed corners</HI> of our chri&s;tian <HI>temple,</HI> the ASYLUM, &s;eems to boa&s;t &s;uperior charms, and to &s;hine forth with di&s;tingui&s;h'd lu&s;tre: like that innocence which &s;he pre&s;erves, and that virtue which &s;he protects; &s;he may be betrayed, &s;u&s;pected, or tra|duced, but like them, &s;he will &s;till be cheri&s;hed by the good, and received by the worthy: whether we con&s;ider the di&s;tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="16" REF="15">
which &s;he relieves, or the mi&s;eries which &s;he prevents, the ble&s;&s;ings which &s;he be&s;tows on the pre&s;ent age, or the felicity which &s;he in&s;ures for the future, &s;he mu&s;t appear in every light mo&s;t amiable and prai&s;e worthy; her form is plea&s;ing, her manners plain and unaffected, her religion pure and undefiled: in a word, &s;he attracts by her &s;implicity, engages by her be|haviour, encourages by her tenderne&s;s, animates by her ex|ample; as if it were her ambition, and a nobler &s;he cannot have, to imitate in all things that gracious and benignant QUEEN who hath conde&s;cended to patronize and protect her.</P>
<P>To conclude then;</P>
<P>Whatever may be our &s;tate or condition in this life, we are all of us, like tho&s;e whom I have been here endeavouring to recommend to you, &s;ubject to dangers, temptations, and di&s;tre&s;s: no rank or &s;tation, how exalted &s;oever, can totally exempt us from tho&s;e &s;orrows or misfortunes which are the common lot and portion of mortality: who is there among&s;t us, that may not &s;ometimes wi&s;h for an ASYLUM? &s;hall we not then, whil&s;t we have it in our power, be&s;tow that &s;helter and relief on others which we our&s;elves may one day &s;tand in need of? let us &s;hew mercy to the fatherle&s;s, if we expect it from the father of mercy; &s;o &s;hall we pre&s;erve to our minds that peace and tran|quility, which alone can render us ea&s;y and contented in this life, &s;o &s;hall we find re&s;t to our &s;ouls, in that ble&s;s'd ASYLUM of peace and happine&s;s, which God hath prepared for the virtuous, the charitable, and the benevolent, in that which is to come.</P>
