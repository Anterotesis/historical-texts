<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING had the honour of being appointed preacher of the <HI>Bampton Lectures</HI> for the current year, by the Heads of Colleges in Oxford, I have the happine&s;s to intro|duce them to the Public with the additional great advantage of your Grace's protection; an advantage the more con&s;iderable, as it derives as much from the character, as the rank of my patron.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4">
In this &s;ituation it will, I pre&s;ume, become me to addre&s;s your Grace ra|ther under the form of preface than in the &s;tyle of dedication.</P>
<P>My &s;lender preten&s;ions to your fa|vour are grounded in the earne&s;t en|deavour of the following &s;heets fully and circum&s;tantially to vindicate that faith which, I need not tell your Grace, is not barely attacked, but in|&s;ulted every day. The Charity which <HI>is not ea&s;ily provoked</HI> mu&s;t re&s;ent the freedom, I had almo&s;t &s;aid the audacity which di&s;tingui&s;hes the infidels of the pre&s;ent generation. The&s;e Gentlemen affect to be the party aggrieved; and to con&s;ole them&s;elves at the &s;ame time with a hope, and &s;ometimes a per|&s;ua&s;ion of the &s;peedy abolition of con|fe&s;&s;ions and &s;y&s;tems, and, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="v" REF="5">
of it, the revival of evangeli|cal doctrine in its native &s;implicity.</P>
<P>I cannot think opinions openly and arrogantly ho&s;tile to the national e&s;|tabli&s;hment can be ju&s;tified even by their &s;incerity. But infidelity in ge|neral is without this excu&s;e: it has been repeatedly &s;hewn to draw its principal re&s;ources from the vigilance of captiou&s;ne&s;s, the popularity of profe&s;&s;ion, the artifice of di&s;&s;imula|tion, the confu&s;ion of things not really connected, and the occa&s;ional &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, or adulteration of truth. To the&s;e I am &s;orry, for our own &s;akes, to add the incon&s;i&s;tency be|tween certain controver&s;ial terms, and the imprudence, or unwarine&s;s of con|ce&s;&s;ion. Such re&s;ources as the&s;e are indeed inexhau&s;tible. Mr. <HI>Bampton</HI>'s wi&s;e and pious in&s;titution, and every

However, my Lord, I flatter my&s;elf I have happily cho&s;en more advan|tageous ground than many of my fellow-&s;oldiers in this warfare; to who&s;e names on other accounts I look up with deference and venera|tion. After all, the event mu&s;t be left in the hands of Providence. I have only to beg the favour of the intelligent reader to peru&s;e the&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es and the annexed annotations, (which will be equally nece&s;&s;ary,) with an inclination to be &s;atisfied; and in that &s;pirit of candor and impartiallity with which, I tru&s;t, he will find them to have been compo&s;ed.

or inequality that may be di&s;covered in it. I hope he will be bia&s;&s;ed, not by &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s of princi|ple, or habit of attachment, but by preponderance of argument. I &s;ub|mit it to his judgment, whether I have in any in&s;tance &s;hewn an undue warmth, or unwarrantable re&s;ent|ment; and de&s;ire him finally to de|termine, as he &s;hall upon the whole be per&s;uaded, not of the abilities of the advocate, but the merits of the cau&s;e. Open to conviction my&s;elf, I &s;hall always be ready to rectify an er|ror, or to renounce an opinion, on competent repre&s;entation; but &s;hall not pay the lea&s;t regard to any cen|&s;ure or animadver&s;ion, the features of which &s;hall manife&s;tly betray it to be the offspring of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, chagrin, or malevolence.</P>

<P>Al&s;o I direct and appoint, that the eight Divinity Lecture Sermons &s;hall be preach|ed upon either of the following &s;ubjects&mdash;to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h the Chri&s;tian Faith, and to confute all heretics and &s;chi&s;|matics&mdash;upon the divine authority of the Holy Scriptures&mdash;upon the authority of the writings of the primitive Fathers, as to the faith and practice of the primitive Church&mdash;upon the Divinity of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;upon the Divi|nity of the Holy Gho&s;t&mdash;upon the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith, as comprehended in the Apo&s;tles' and Nicene Creeds.</P>

<P>THIS que&s;tion, of all by far the mo&s;t important, was put to our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour by the <HI>Roman Governour,</HI> perhaps care|le&s;&s;ly, perhaps contemptuou&s;ly, but certainly without the lea&s;t wi&s;h for information. In much the &s;ame &s;pirit of &s;corn, or with &s;imi|lar indifference, the &s;ame que&s;tion is every day in the mouths, &s;ometimes of &s;ceptics and &s;coffers, and &s;ometimes of men of a more &s;erious ca&s;t, who affect to be per&s;uaded that we cannot, and, it may be, de&s;ire not to give them &s;atisfaction. Unhappily, the Chri&s;tian world is divided and &s;ubdivided almo&s;t infi|nitely;
<PB N="2" REF="15">
it is parcelled out into &s;ectaries of a thou&s;and denominations. The fact is, though the right of private judgment in mat|ters of religion, which has been exerci&s;ed from the beginning, was ju&s;tly and nece&s;&s;arily a&s;|&s;erted by the leaders and friends of the RE|FORMATION, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, folly, perver&s;ene&s;s, pride, and enthu&s;ia&s;m, have, by &s;everally maintaining it, been productive of that &s;trange multiplicity of religious &s;enti|ment which we have &s;o much cau&s;e to la|ment; of that &s;chi&s;m, here&s;y, &s;ceptici&s;m, and infidelity, which have all along di&s;turbed the Church, but fix a mark of peculiar di&s;|grace on the la&s;t and pre&s;ent century.</P>
<P>And indeed, when it is con&s;idered, that the Scriptures are on many accounts particu|larly liable to be mi&s;applied, perverted, or mi&s;con&s;trued; <HI>(a)</HI> that &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages are to be under&s;tood in a literal, and &s;ome in a figura|tive &s;en&s;e; that &s;ome things are expre&s;&s;ed agreeably to the modes of common &s;peech, and &s;ome in pure conde&s;cen&s;ion to the human capacity; that pa&s;&s;ages are to be compared
<PB N="3" REF="16">
with each other in order to a true under&s;tand|ing of them, and doctrines to be deduced, not &s;o much from &s;ingle and &s;eparate texts, as from the manife&s;t tenor of the Scriptures at large; that not unfrequently one and the &s;ame text &s;hall be capable of different, and even oppo&s;ite con&s;truction; that though mo&s;t places in holy writ are of univer&s;al im|portance, yet &s;ome are of temporary and oc|ca&s;ional purport only; that the &s;acred writ|ings, &s;trictly &s;peaking, are the foundation of a rule of faith and manners, &s;uch as a creed, formulary, or confe&s;&s;ion, rather than the rule it&s;elf, as will, I tru&s;t, in due time more fully appear; and that an a&s;&s;ent to the collective body of &s;cripture, as true, does not imply a knowlege, or belief of all &s;crip|tural truths; when all this, to which more, were there occa&s;ion, might be added, is fairly con&s;idered, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly be at a lo&s;s to account for that variety of notion, that wild|ne&s;s and ab&s;urdity of conceit, that extrava|gance, or impiety of opinion, which I ju&s;t now ob&s;erved has more or le&s;s &s;o &s;hamefully di&s;honoured the Chri&s;tian name in all ages.
<PB N="4" REF="17">
Of this exuberance of folly and wicked|ne&s;s Popery has ever been indu&s;trious to avail it&s;elf. From the acknowledged liablene&s;s of the Scriptures to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;e, when in the hands of &s;uch as are <HI>unlearned</HI> and <HI>un&s;ta|ble,</HI> (to u&s;e the apo&s;tle's words,) the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> draws her mo&s;t &s;pecious argument again&s;t the common u&s;e of them; and would fain have us infer the nece&s;&s;ity, or the cer|tainty of an infallible authority lodged in the Church for the deci&s;ion of controver&s;ies, and a&s;certainment of a rule of faith, from the confe&s;&s;ed convenience and utility of &s;uch an authority. <HI>(b)</HI> But, unfortunately for her pre|ten&s;ions, as much error and ab&s;urdity has re|peatedly been demon&s;trated to be within her pale as out of it. <HI>Wh t is truth?</HI> becomes therefore with many a que&s;tion of as much difficulty as importance; or, rather, of more form than importance; &s;ome encouraging them&s;elves in &s;ceptici&s;m from the&s;e circum|&s;tances, and others blindly acquie&s;cing in any mode of religion, or in none at all, or at be&s;t in that which is u&s;ually called natural religion, from a pretence of the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of
<PB N="5" REF="18">
di&s;covering the true under &s;uch a complica|tion of perplexity.</P>
<P>With points of inferior con&s;equence I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf; but to &s;uch as deny, or call in que&s;tion the capital articles of our religion on the &s;trength of the above con&s;ide|rations, let me in&s;i&s;t that nothing of this na|ture ought to &s;uper&s;ede their endeavours to find the truth, and much le&s;s to di&s;courage their obedience to it when found. After inquiry we may in &s;ome re&s;pect or other be mi&s;taken, but without it we are inexcu&s;able. In fact, the very diver&s;ity, or contrariety complained of may be ju&s;tly urged in behalf of the faith which is received in the Church. Were the doctrine of the Trinity, for in&s;tance, impugned from one quarter only, and by con&s;i&s;tent and uniform oppo&s;ition, infidelity would be a much more formidable thing than it is; but you may as well look for <HI>one language</HI> at <HI>Ba|bel</HI> as for a catholic &s;y&s;tem of unbelief, if I may be indulged with the expre&s;&s;ion. To enumerate all the here&s;ies which have at different times torn and di&s;membered the
<PB N="6" REF="19">
Church of Chri&s;t, is in a manner to confute them; and the&s;e, their common animo&s;ity again&s;t her excepted, are <HI>at</HI> perpetual <HI>enmity</HI> among them&s;elves. Nay, what is yet more extraordinary, we &s;hall find infidelity it&s;elf abounding in my&s;teries, even while it repro|bates them almo&s;t with the confidence of a <HI>faith</HI> which <HI>could remove mountains!</HI> If the &s;acred theory we are to maintain be in many re&s;pects incomprehen&s;ible, the &s;ub&s;titutions of human wi&s;dom will in due time be &s;hewn to be at lea&s;t equally &s;o; and to require the &s;ame degree of a&s;&s;ent without any thing like the &s;ame foundation.</P>
<P><HI>What is truth, &s;ay</HI> others <HI>among us,</HI> what is it but a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines officially taught, and formally tran&s;mitted from generation to generation?</P>
<P>But if doctrines are true, why not officially taught, and carefully tran&s;mitted? Is profe&s;|&s;ion ridiculous, or authority contemptible, as &s;uch? Indeed, the que&s;tion is not, what &s;aith the Church?&mdash;but&mdash;<HI>what &s;aith the</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="20">
<HI>Scripture?</HI> Now by Scripture, and the ear|lie&s;t antiquity, our &s;ure&s;t guide, and pure&s;t precedent, we are not only willing, but wi&s;h|ful to be tried. It is true the bulk of Chri&s;|tians are not equal to this trial; in a certain &s;en&s;e, they <HI>care for none of the&s;e things;</HI> they take matters upon tru&s;t; they are not able to <HI>give an an&s;wer to every man that a&s;keth a rea|&s;on of the</HI> faith <HI>that is in them,</HI> except that they were born and bred in it, and &s;uppo&s;e it to be unque&s;tionable. It is with re&s;pect to this implicitne&s;s of a&s;&s;ent, this tamene&s;s of acquie&s;cence, as it is opprobriou&s;ly called, that the doctrine of the Holy Trinity has no le&s;s impiou&s;ly than ludicrou&s;ly been expo&s;ed to contempt under the de&s;cription of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 16, 36, 37. in Preface to <HI>Stilling fleet</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e in vindication of the doctrine of the Trinity.</NOTE><HI>Tri|nity of the Mob!</HI> But this is very unfair re|pre&s;entation.

of critici&s;m. The &s;piritual &s;tate of the <HI>common people</HI> all over the world falls nearly under the &s;ame predicament; but at the &s;ame time a proportionable degree of &s;a|tisfaction will always be derived to every man from every degree of rational a&s;&s;urance that he is in the <HI>right way;</HI> or belongs to a com|munion wherein the truth is held in purity approaching neare&s;t to the &s;tandard of primi|tive Chri&s;tianity.</P>

Too true indeed it is that the principal controverted points &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among tho&s;e "who profe&s;s and call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians" are of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature. If the tenets of our gain&s;ayers and adver&s;aries of many ap|pellations are right and ju&s;t, the doctrines of the Trinity, and of the re&s;urrection of the body, (which will be the objects of the en&s;uing di&s;qui&s;itions,) are here&s;ies of the mo&s;t abominable, or ridiculous tendency. However, the&s;e are circum&s;tances which &s;hould not check, but &s;timulate the &s;pirit of inve&s;tigation. It will be of infinite moment to inquire whether we or they are the mi&s;|taken party, and on which &s;ide error really lies; whether <HI>our</HI> doctrines or <HI>theirs</HI> have the &s;tronge&s;t foundation in &s;cripture and an|tiquity; are be&s;t &s;upported by pre&s;umptive ar|gument, and corroborative evidence; or have lea&s;t recour&s;e to artifice, and the pitifulne&s;s of &s;ubterfuge and eva&s;ion. We do not wi&s;h to have this matter determined either vul|garly by a majority of voices, or invidiou&s;ly by the reputation of names.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="25">
But again, &s;ay others, <HI>What is truth?</HI>&mdash;What good purpo&s;e is an&s;wered, or what ad|vantage gained by this extraordinary zeal for theory and e&s;tabli&s;hment? What doth it but <HI>gender &s;trifes,</HI> and feed the flame of conten|tion? The practical doctrines of the go&s;pel are &s;o forcibly, yet &s;o familiarly inculcated, as not to be liable to mi&s;interpretation. <HI>Con|cerning the faith</HI> thou&s;ands <HI>have erred,</HI> but, <HI>as</HI> one <HI>of</HI> our <HI>own poets</HI> hath <HI>&s;aid,</HI>

<P>It is well for us there is nothing argumen|tative in the jingle of a couplet.

that con&s;equently it is of the utmo&s;t impor|tance to our &s;piritual intere&s;ts to be right in principle as well as in practice.

People do not &s;eem to be &s;ufficiently aware that a right faith and a good life are required by this form of confe&s;&s;ion under the &s;ame penalty. <Q>Which faith except a man keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he &s;hall peri&s;h everla&s;tingly.

This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be &s;aved.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="28">
It is plain the&s;e clau&s;es are to be con&s;idered as &s;imply declarative on &s;criptural grounds of the nece&s;&s;ity both of faith and of good works to &s;alvation; and at the &s;ame time as leaving all men to that infinite mercy, and tho&s;e ine&s;|timable merits, which are fully adequate to the pardon and atonement of &s;ins, failings, ignorances, and errors of integrity. <HI>(c)</HI> Which few con&s;iderations will, I apprehend, fairly deliver the Creed before us from the reproach of uncharitablene&s;s. With regard to the &s;e|veral articles of which it con&s;i&s;ts, I tru&s;t, they will be found, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e di&s;qui&s;i|tions, to have foundation in a fully competent authority; and in the mean time I &s;hall endeavour to remove one general prejudice again&s;t them, and to create rather a prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion in their favour, by evincing, that their acknowleged my&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s and incompre|hen&s;ibility does by no means unqualify them for our a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>"Man is as &s;uch a rational creature;" and as a rational creature he is a believing one too. We can no more conceive him to be

without belief, than without &s;en&s;e, thought, or reflection. The Athei&s;t who <HI>&s;ays in his heart,</HI> as well as with his lips, <HI>there is no God,</HI> believes there is none. He prote&s;ts again&s;t the &s;up|po&s;ed folly, or extravagance of the fundamen|tal article of all religion; and on the &s;trength of fal&s;e conclu&s;ions, re&s;olves every thing into a concour&s;e of atoms fortuitou&s;ly uniting; or into the operation of an unintelligent prin|ciple which we call nature; or, in other words, into an everla&s;ting &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es and effects. It is po&s;&s;ible for a man to deny his own exi&s;tence, or that there is any &s;uch thing as motion. We have heard of in&s;tances of this &s;ort; though properly they are in|&s;tances, not of fal&s;e per&s;ua&s;ion, but of in|&s;anity. <HI>(d)</HI> Still man is a rational creature, whether he rea&s;ons well or ill; and whether, in con&s;equence of &s;uch rea&s;oning, his faith be well or ill grounded. It is certain we know little or nothing by intuition. The mind yields a&s;&s;ent to many my&s;terious truths by forming a very &s;mall chain of deductions; &s;uch as the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, the infinite progre&s;&s;ion of number, and eternity, as well <HI>a</HI>

This will readily be granted even by infidels who deny the truths of Revelation; and much more by &s;uch Chri&s;tians as have
<PB N="16" REF="31">
called into debate particular points of that Revelation, to which in general they profe&s;s to &s;ub&s;cribe. It is well worth remarking that Dei&s;ts and Heretics never fail to at|tack the profe&s;&s;ed athei&s;t with &s;uch rea&s;on|ings, as, if pur&s;ued through their ju&s;t con|&s;equences, may fairly and &s;ucce&s;sfully be en|forced upon them&s;elves. For if <HI>he</HI> affects to decry the fundamental principle of all reli|gion, the Being of a God, on account of the pretended inconceivablene&s;s of it, will not <HI>they</HI> ob&s;erve, in order to confute him, that, unle&s;s a more complete, a more uniform, and intelligible &s;y&s;tem could be built on the ruins of this great article, &s;uch his exception can have no weight? And this is the very rea|&s;oning we urge again&s;t the principles both of dei&s;ts and heretics. With the profe&s;&s;ed athei&s;t I &s;hall no farther concern my&s;elf; but de|&s;ire to ob&s;erve, that dei&s;ts and heretics of all denominations are agreed with us in one ge|neral point, the acknowlegement of the ex|i&s;tence of God, and con&s;equently the incom|prehen&s;iblene&s;s of the Divine nature, attri|butes, and operations. The primary notion
<PB N="17" REF="32">
which the human mind frames of God is this general and complex, yet negative idea of incomprehen&s;iblene&s;s. There is a certain preeminence, if I may &s;o call it, in the Di|vine e&s;&s;ence, &amp;c. which utterly precludes in|ve&s;tigation. But if &s;o, all my&s;teries, whether natural or religious, whether relative, <HI>e. g.</HI> to the exten&s;ion of &s;pace, &amp;c. or to the nature of the Deity; all the&s;e, if con&s;idered purely as my&s;teries, will &s;tand upon a level in point of credibility. And let a revelation be &s;up|po&s;ed, all adventitious truths introduced there|by will be fixed upon the &s;ame foot; becau&s;e faith cannot have a &s;tronger foundation in hu|man rea&s;on than in divine authority. This is granted without difficulty; but then as the dei&s;t denies the authenticity of tho&s;e writings which we affirm to contain &s;uch revelation, &s;o the heretic di&s;putes the &s;en&s;e and &s;cope of them. The que&s;tion therefore is, whether the opinion of the one, and the unbelief of the other, is re&s;pectively the re&s;ult of judg|ment, or of pa&s;&s;ion; of conviction, or of pride; of impartial enquiry, or of unwilling|ne&s;s to &s;ubmit the under&s;tanding of man to
<PB N="18" REF="33">
the <HI>wi&s;dom of God?</HI> For, I repeat it, nei|ther the one nor the other can, con&s;i&s;tently with his own principles and acknowledg|ments, controvert the received &s;en&s;e, or deny the authority of tho&s;e writings which the Church holds to be the <HI>Word of God,</HI> barely on account of my&s;terious truths contained in them. If the Divine E&s;&s;ence be nece&s;&s;arily incomprehen&s;ible, no Revelation can po&s;&s;ibly make it le&s;s &s;o; &s;o far from it, that the very idea of a Divine Revelation, with re&s;pect to that e&s;&s;ence, implies a Revelation of my&s;te|ries; <HI>i. e.</HI> of truths undi&s;coverable, and in|conceivable by our natural powers; and ac|cordingly, the credit of Revelation is rather confirmed than weakened by the number and importance of &s;uch truths. For it is but natural to expect a more ample di&s;play of wonders, and larger di&s;coveries of &s;ublime and &s;acred points of faith in this Revelation; and &s;urely God is not the le&s;s to be believed, the more he communicates to us of his na|ture, properties, and di&s;pen&s;ations. As far as the&s;e remarks affect Revelation in gene|ral, heretics in general will admit the ju&s;t|ne&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="34">
of them; though at the very in&s;tant that they allow the writings in que&s;tion to be the &s;ole rule of faith, they endeavour, as much as may be, to reduce that rule to the mea&s;ure of their own judgments and apprehen&s;ions. I am however already ju&s;tified in a&s;&s;erting, that as much as &s;ome people are aver&s;e to be|lieving what they do not under&s;tand, they cannot avoid believing what they do not un|der&s;tand; and that therefore, on proper au|thority, it is full as rea&s;onable to believe an hundred my&s;teries as one. <HI>(e)</HI> And here taking my leave of the dei&s;t, I would de&s;ire the he|retic by what appellation &s;oever di&s;tingui&s;hed, to recollect, that Revelation left human na|ture as it found it; I mean with re&s;pect to our intellectual faculties; that, <HI>from the be|ginning of the creation</HI> to this very hour, man is to be con&s;idered as a rea&s;onable creature, as a free-agent, as &s;ometimes believing upon competent evidence, &s;ometimes governed by pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ometimes influenced by pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. A truth which accounts in a mo|ment for the multitude of per&s;ua&s;ions which have engaged the &s;peculative world. To ex|pect,
<PB N="20" REF="35">
or require that God &s;hould manife&s;t him|&s;elf and his proceedings, &amp;c. to every man fully and per&s;onally, is to de&s;troy every no|tion not only of faith, but of obedience likewi&s;e; and to wi&s;h to invert the e&s;&s;ential frame and con&s;titution of things. Difficul|ties, un&s;urmountable difficulties of many kinds occur to our contemplations on that frame and con&s;titution; difficulties, on which the light of Revelation darts not a &s;ingle beam. If we indulge the excur&s;ive faculty of imagination beyond the bounds which rea&s;on and &s;cripture have &s;et us, we &s;hall find our&s;elves inextricably entangled in per|plexity, and &s;ometimes in impiety too. Who &s;hall di&s;cover the con&s;i&s;tency between Divine pre&s;cience and human free-will? Yet that man acts freely, and that God foreknows all events, and decrees accordingly, are equal|ly truths not to be &s;haken by any &s;eeming irreconcileablene&s;s or contrariety what&s;oever. So again: that the mo&s;t perfect <HI>freedom</HI> of agency mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to God, cannot po&s;|&s;ibly be controverted; and yet does he not <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> foreknow his own actions? Does
<PB N="21" REF="36">
not <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> act agreeably to the eternal rules of ju&s;tice, wi&s;dom, and holine&s;s? That God is in no &s;en&s;e the author of evil, either natu|ral or moral, every rea&s;onable man, and much more every Chri&s;tian will maintain; yet is it not certain, that had this world never been made, neither <HI>&s;in</HI> nor <HI>death</HI> could have <HI>entered</HI> into it? Human wi&s;dom has fatigued it&s;elf to no purpo&s;e in the ventilation of the&s;e &s;ub|jects. <HI>(f)</HI> Many real truths, but at pre&s;ent &s;eeming paradoxes, will doubtle&s;s be capable of future explication; and &s;piritual things in general &s;hould rather be received with the humility of reverence, than encountered with the arrogance of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. There will be no end to <HI>doubtful di&s;putations</HI> while men's &s;entiments are modified by a partial attach|ment to a favourite principle; and while truths, apparently oppo&s;ite and contradicto|ry, are &s;eparately contended for, which ought both to be admitted; as ultimately they will be reconciled.</P>
<P>What has been here advanced concerning faith, or my&s;teries in general, will, I tru&s;t,

&s;ecure at lea&s;t a fair and earne&s;t attention to what I &s;hall have to offer in defence of the my&s;teries of the Go&s;pel.

<P>That the doctrines of the Church of <HI>En|gland,</HI> the doctrine of one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, and that of the Re&s;ur|rection of the Body, are as reconcileable to our ideas as the con&s;i&s;tency of free-will with nece&s;&s;ity, or of the Divine perfections with the exi&s;tence of evil, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, no man can deny; and therefore the great que&s;|tion is, whether tho&s;e doctrines be undeniably in tho&s;e Scriptures which all with whom I am concerned acknowledge to be the rule of faith.</P>
<P>That, with re&s;pect to the Trinity, the doctrine of the Church has been &s;o long, &s;o frequently, &s;o copiou&s;ly agitated with much le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s, on our part, than might have been expected from &s;ome of the be&s;t <HI>Soldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI>

<P>Without laying before you at pre&s;ent all, or the principal texts by which the doctrine
<PB N="26" REF="41">
of the Trinity is &s;upported, or in which the ab&s;olute divinity both of the Son and of the Holy Gho&s;t is explicitly a&s;&s;erted, or nece&s;&s;arily implied, we may previou&s;ly re|mark that, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be authen|tic, unequivocal, and intelligible, the in|fidel is in fact precluded from taking advan|tage of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which are declarative either of the acknowleged humanity of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, or of the gifts and operations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit: that humanity, and tho&s;e operations being things manife&s;tly di&s;|tinct from the Divine e&s;&s;ence, and real per|&s;onality. What we &s;hall have to do therefore will be to enquire, in due time and place, whether the exceptions which have been made again&s;t the texts with which the catho|lic doctrine is fortified, are grounded in prin|ciples of common candour and common &s;en&s;e; or, in other words, whether the in|terpretations of anti-trinitarians are critically ju&s;t, and agreable to the rules which are ge|nerally allowed to govern interpretation. In the mean time, it will be well worth while to examine, whether the doctrine before us
<PB N="27" REF="42">
is not proveable by evidence which, though indirect and collateral, is irre&s;i&s;tible. There is hardly any &s;uch thing as framing a &s;en|tence, or a propo&s;ition that cannot be preva|ricated with; but the tenor of a context, and the weight of circum&s;tances will not ea&s;ily admit of &s;ophi&s;tication.</P>
<P>According to the Athana&s;ian Creed, as it is called, <Q>the Catholic Faith is this; that we wor&s;hip one God in Trinity, and Tri|nity in Unity; and that the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t is all one: the Glory equal, the Maje&s;ty co-eternal.</Q> <HI>But what &s;aith the Scripture?

<P>Again.

<P>THESE words immediately refer to the great event of our Lord's re&s;urrec|tion, but in con&s;equence of it to the divinity of his per&s;on. Of this therefore I &s;hall pro|ceed to lay more proofs before you, taking fir&s;t this opportunity to obviate the following popular objection; that, notwith&s;tanding all that has been, or can be advanced, the doctrine before us is not &s;o ab&s;olutely clear and indi&s;putable as we would have it thought, and as a fundamental article of faith ought to be; in as much as no text can be pro|duced which preci&s;ely, and <HI>totidem verbis,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="70">
&s;peaks the language of the fir&s;t article of our Church; <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>in the unity of the Godhead there be three Per&s;ons of one &s;ub&s;tance, power, and eternity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t; or of the &s;econd; two whole and perfect natures, that is to &s;ay, the Godhead and Manhood are joined together in one Per&s;on, never to be di|vided, whereof is one Chri&s;t, very God and very man; or of the fifth; the Holy Gho&s;t, proceeding from the Father, and the Son, is of one &s;ub&s;tance, maje&s;ty, and glory with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God.</Q></P>
<P>To all this, I apprehend, we may readily reply, that if there be any real force in &s;uch objections, it will operate much farther by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence than the objectors them&s;elves can be &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;ire it &s;hould. For it will &s;upply the perver&s;e, or idle caviller with pretences and exceptions again&s;t all the divine properties and attri|butes, as far as they are a&s;&s;erted in the fir&s;t article. There is no <HI>one</HI> pa&s;&s;age in the Scrip|ture
<PB N="57" REF="71">
which literally tells us, that <Q>there is but one living and true God, everla&s;ting, without body, parts, or pa&s;&s;ions, of infinite power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, the Maker and Pre&s;erver of all things both vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible.</Q> The divine &s;uperintendency, &amp;c, u&s;ually called <HI>Providence,</HI> is ju&s;tly re|puted one of the capital doctrines of reli|gion. Yet, upon the principles of the&s;e ob|jectors, it &s;hould be no doctrine at all. For we meet with no &s;uch term as <HI>Providence,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e demanded, either in the <HI>old</HI> or <HI>new</HI> Te&s;tament. So that this doctrine mu&s;t inevi|tably fall to the ground, unle&s;s it be main|tained and &s;upported by natural inference; or unle&s;s we are at liberty to make u&s;e of a proper term to expre&s;s our &s;en&s;e of it. He who objects to the term&mdash;<HI>Trinity</HI>&mdash;as un|&s;criptural, &s;hould con&s;ider by what texts he will undertake to prove the <HI>Unity</HI> of the Divine Nature; which, in the &s;en&s;e required by his argument, is a term no more to be found in Scripture than the other. In fact, upon the principle of our opponents, we &s;hall be under a nece&s;&s;ity of expunging a
<PB N="58" REF="72">
great part of the Apo&s;tles Creed, and even &s;uch parts of it as all Chri&s;tians whatever, without the lea&s;t &s;cruple or he&s;itation, have a&s;&s;ented to. For I de&s;ire to know by what expre&s;s or literal authority of Scripture any per&s;on believes in the <HI>Holy Catholic Church,</HI> or in the <HI>Communion of Saints;</HI> or that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord was <HI>born of the Virgin Mary, or &s;uffered under Pontius Pilate,</HI> &amp;c? In &s;hort, if we are to be ab&s;olutely precluded the u&s;e and application of proper terms and expre&s;&s;ions in the inve&s;tigation and expo&s;ition of Scrip|ture-meaning, it will, I pre&s;ume, be impo&s;|&s;ible to frame the mo&s;t &s;imple &s;y&s;tem, or for|mulary of Chri&s;tian faith and doctrine, or any &s;uch thing as a <HI>Creed</HI> of any kind in the Church. The holy Scripture is the &s;ole rule or mea&s;ure of every form of confe&s;&s;ion, &amp;c; it is the only te&s;t by which any doctrine, or &s;y&s;tem is, in all its branches, even the mo&s;t minute of them, to be deliberately and ulti|mately tried; but it is not the rule it&s;elf; and indeed a little inquiry will &s;hew us why the capital points of religion are not &s;y&s;te|matically delivered in the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="73">
The doctrine of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> as main|tained by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> was the doctrine of the Catholic Church at and before the time of the publication of the Scriptures of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> or it was not. If it was, the controver&s;y is at an end. If it was not, we would fain know how to account for that great variety of pa&s;&s;ages, and tho&s;e numerous circum&s;tances, by which it is at lea&s;t &s;o plau|&s;ibly countenanced, not to &s;ay forcibly de|fended. We would fain know how to re|concile with the character of the <HI>meek</HI> and the <HI>lowly</HI> Je&s;us, any one of his expre&s;&s;ions which is capable of being con&s;trued into a claim to the Divinity. If this doctrine was the doctrine of the Church previou&s;ly to the publication of the holy writings, they are &s;ufficiently full and explicit for the &s;atisfac|tion, or confirmation of Chri&s;tians of all ages; if otherwi&s;e, here is more than enough &s;aid to perplex and mi&s;guide them, and to lead them into errors of the fir&s;t magnitude. The great que&s;tion therefore, I take it, is, whe|ther we have not all the rea&s;on in the world to infer from the very mode in which the
<PB N="60" REF="74">
doctrine of the <HI>Trinity</HI> is in&s;erted and incul|cated in the &s;acred pages; the que&s;tion, I &s;ay, is, whether we are not authori&s;ed by this circum&s;tance to conclude that this doc|trine was antecedently received in the Chri&s;|tian world? For in&s;tance; &s;uppo&s;ing the doc|trine of the <HI>Trinity</HI> to have been the &s;tanding doctrine of the Church when St. <HI>John (k)</HI> wrote his Go&s;pel, we have no kind of diffi|culty to encounter; but are we not very much embara&s;&s;ed by the contrary &s;uppo&s;i|tion? In the former ca&s;e, we may readily conceive the Apo&s;tle to be a&s;&s;erting the Divi|nity of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms at the beginning of his Go&s;pel; and, in the cour&s;e of it, to record many particulars clearly declarative of the &s;ame; not by way of formal an&s;wer to <HI>Cerinthus,</HI> or any other heretic that di&s;puted, or denied it, but purely in flat contradiction to the novel and he|terodox notions advanced and propagated by them; and to encourage and &s;tabli&s;h good Chri&s;tians in the faith, as they had all along been taught. What this great Evangeli&s;t de|clares at the latter end of his Go&s;pel, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="75">
that <HI>the&s;e things were written,</HI> or, as we may &s;ay, given under his own hand, that the Chri&s;tians whom he addre&s;&s;es <HI>might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, the Son of God,</HI> is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with their pre-acquain|tance with the&s;e matters. Agreably hereunto, and indeed in direct confirmation of our hy|pothe&s;is, St. <HI>Luke</HI> (and many, it &s;eems, before him,) <HI>&s;et in order a declaration of tho&s;e things which mo&s;t &s;urely were believed among Chri&s;|tians,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 1.</NOTE>that the per&s;on he writes to <HI>might know the certainty of tho&s;e things wherein</HI> he had <HI>been in&s;tructed.</HI> In the &s;ame light we may re|gard tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the epi&s;tles which have often been produced in vindication of the doctrine before us. Some of the&s;e epi&s;tles were, with re&s;pect to the main end and de|&s;ign of them, entirely of a temporary nature; being written with a view to the deci&s;ion of controver&s;ies in the primitive Church, which for many centuries have been out of date; and upon &s;everal occa&s;ions and &s;ubjects of little moment to &s;ucceeding generations. Not one of them however was profe&s;&s;edly written
<PB N="62" REF="76">
in defence of the doctrine of the <HI>Trinity.</HI> Ac|cording to our pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is, a vindi|cation of this kind had been ab&s;olutely &s;u|perfluous; and though we cannot wonder to ob&s;erve a point of this con&s;equence fre|quently mentioned, or alluded to in the&s;e writings, yet it would be very unrea&s;onable to expect to find it methodically or &s;y&s;tema|tically taught.</P>
<P>The grand principle of the leading op|pugners of the doctrine under con&s;ideration is, that the only thing required of Chri&s;|tians to be believed with regard to the Per&s;on of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is, that he was the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the Per&s;on promi&s;ed and &s;ent by God to re|deem men from that death which they were inevitably appointed to as de&s;cendants of <HI>Adam;</HI> and that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>king of I&s;rael,</HI> and the <HI>Son of God,</HI> are terms or titles in Scripture ab&s;olutely denoting one and the &s;ame thing. I need not tell you, that this is the favourite tenet of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> in his treati&s;e on the <HI>Rea&s;ona|blene&s;s of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> as delivered in Scripture.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="77">
Now we &s;hall willingly admit, that the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves were believers under this idea mo&s;tly, during our Saviour's re&s;i|dence upon earth; as 'tis certain, they had not the whole <HI>my&s;tery</HI> of the Divine <HI>Will,</HI> the grand &s;cheme of man's redemption, clearly and fully made known to them before our Lord's A&s;cen&s;ion into heaven. <HI>I have many things to &s;ay unto you,</HI> he &s;ays to them, <HI>but ye cannot bear them now;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 12.</NOTE>&amp;c. and in &s;aying this he had mo&s;t probably an eye to the <HI>my&s;tery</HI> of the Go&s;pel.

We &s;hall be enabled, by &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e, to put the true con&s;truction on the title of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> in mo&s;t, if not all the places where it occurs in the Epi&s;tles; naturally taking into the account the many clear and expre&s;s proofs of our Lord's Divi|nity which are cited from them. Of &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking of the&s;e proofs, among other particulars, we &s;hall for &s;atisfaction|&s;ake take a review in proper time. What Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has adduced on this &s;ubject with a purpo&s;e to invalidate the&s;e proofs in general, will, I am confident, be utterly overthrown by the force of the following con&s;iderations; <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> are a part of the <HI>New Te&s;|ment,</HI> and as e&s;&s;ential a part as the Go&s;pels; were like them, as was ob&s;erved, written oc|ca&s;ionally, and after our Saviour's <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c; that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> e. g. was as much a <HI>teacher</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> an in&s;pired <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> as St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> or any other Apo&s;tle who has hi&s;torically recorded the actions, words, or doctrine of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and that a <HI>Creed,</HI> or &s;y&s;tem of faith &s;hould have its foundation in the&s;e <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> together with the other Scrip|tures.

The truth is, St. <HI>John</HI> in his <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> a&s;&s;&eacute;rts the &s;ame doctrine of our Lord's Divi|nity as in his Go&s;pel. By Mr. <HI>Locke's</HI> way of proceeding, <HI>viz.</HI> arbitrarily admitting, or re|jecting Scripture, we may mould Chri&s;tianity into what form we plea&s;e; and to this way of proceeding, among other cau&s;es, we are to a&s;cribe the various Schi&s;ms, and Here&s;ies, which have &s;o long, and &s;o deplorably di|vided the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>We may now, I imagine, fairly date the reception of the doctrine of our Lord's Di|vinity from his re&s;urrection; and we will next &s;ee whether the &s;ub&s;equent accounts we have of the propagation of the Go&s;pel be not entirely uniform and con&s;i&s;tent upon this hypothe&s;is, at the &s;ame time that they open to us the whole <HI>Trinitarian</HI> &s;y&s;tem.</P>

Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me? And he &s;aid, who art thou, Lord? And the Lord &s;aid, I am Je&s;us whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t: it is hard for thee to kick again&s;t the pricks. And he trembling, and a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;aid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord &s;aid, Ari&s;e, and go into the city, and it &s;hall be told thee; and Saul aro&s;e, and when his eyes were opened, he &s;aw no man; but they led him, and brought him into Dama&s;cus. And there was a certain di&s;ciple at Dama&s;cus, named Ananias; and to him &s;aid the Lord in a vi&s;ion, Ananias. And he &s;aid, behold I am here, Lord. And the Lord &s;aid, Ari&s;e, and go into the &s;treet which is called &s;trait, and enquire in the hou&s;e of Judas for one called Saul of Tar&s;us; for behold he prayeth; and hath &s;een in a vi&s;ion a man named Ananias, coming in, and putting his hands on him, that he might receive his &s;ight. Then Ana|nias an&s;wered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy &s;aints at Jeru&s;alem: and here he hath autho|rity from the chief prie&s;ts, to bind all that call on thy name. But the Lord &s;aid unto him, go thy way; for he is a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el unto me. And
<PB N="85" REF="99">
Ananias went his way, and entered into the hou&s;e; and putting his hands on him, &s;aid, Bro|ther Saul, the Lord (even Je&s;us that appeared unto thee) hath &s;ent me, that thou mighte&s;t re|ceive thy &s;ight, and be filled with the Holy Gho&s;t. And he received &s;ight forthwith, and aro&s;e, and was baptized. Then was Saul certain days with the di&s;ciples which were at Dama&s;cus; and he preached Chri&s;t in the &s;ynagogues, that he is the Son of God. But all that heard him were amazed, and &s;aid, is not this he that de&s;troyed them which called on this name? But Saul in|crea&s;ed the more in &s;trength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Dama&s;cus, proving that this is very Chri&s;t. <HI>Upon this compendious narrative I remark, fir&s;t, that throughout the whole we mu&s;t under&s;tand by&mdash;the</HI> Lord&mdash;Je&s;us Chri&s;t: <HI>&s;econdly, that whether</HI> Saul <HI>re|ceived the</HI> Holy Gho&s;t <HI>by virtue of the impo|&s;ition of the hands of</HI> Ananias, <HI>and previou&s;ly to his bapti&s;m, or after it; in either ca&s;e, the whole</HI> my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel <HI>mu&s;t have been communicated to him by immediate ir|radiation: and, thirdly, that therefore when</HI> he preached Chri&s;t in the Synagogues that he is
<PB N="86" REF="100">
the Son of God, <HI>he a&s;&s;erted him &s;o to be by eternal generation. Occa&s;ionally indeed, when he</HI> confounded the Jews, <HI>by proving</HI> that this is very Chri&s;t, <HI>his argument no doubt turned upon what he alledged to &s;hew that</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>was the true</HI> Me&s;&s;iah, <HI>the</HI> prophet that &s;hould come into the world, <HI>and the</HI> king of I&s;rael <HI>in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, whom they had, and did expect under the idea of a temporal Saviour. It &s;eems after this</HI> Saul &s;pake boldly in the name of the Lord Je&s;us at Jeru&s;alem; <HI>and we are told, that upon his being</HI> &s;ent forth to Tar&s;us, <HI>that he might be out of the reach of the</HI> Gre|cians, <HI>who</HI> went about to &s;lay him, the Chur|ches had re&s;t throughout all Judea, &amp;c, and were edified, and walking in the <HI>FEAR OF THE LORD,</HI> and in the <HI>COMFORT OF THE HOLY GHOST,</HI> were multiplied. <HI>I recommend the two la&s;t particulars of this pa&s;&s;age to the at|tention of every candid and intelligent hearer. I add too, in corroboration of what has been offered under this portion of the hi&s;tory, that as</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>here tells</HI> Ananias, <HI>that</HI> Saul <HI>was</HI> a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el unto <HI>HIM, &s;o</HI> Ananias <HI>tells</HI> Paul, <HI>(according to the latter's account of</HI>

<P>The conver&s;ion of <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his family pre&s;ents it&s;elf next to our con&s;ideration; and the &s;hort, but important narrative of it is pregnant with matter to our purpo&s;e. This <HI>pro&s;elyte</HI> of the <HI>gates</HI> (for &s;uch doubtle&s;s he was) <HI>&s;aw evidently an Angel of</HI> GOD <HI>coming unto him,</HI> &amp;c.

The &s;ame will be ob&s;ervable likewi&s;e in the
<PB N="88" REF="102">
harangue of the Apo&s;tle upon this extraordi|nary occa&s;ion. <HI>Of a truth I perceive that</HI> GOD <HI>is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons; but in every nation he that feareth him, &amp;c. is accepted with him. The word which</HI> GOD <HI>&s;ent unto the child|ren of I&s;rael, preaching peace by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> (HE IS LORD OF ALL,) <HI>that word, I &s;ay, you know, which was publi&s;hed throughout all Ju|dea; how God anointed Je&s;us of Nazareth with the</HI> HOLY GHOST, <HI>and with power,</HI> &amp;c. However, if it be objected, that it is by no means credible this devout <HI>pro&s;elyte</HI> and his family &s;hould be converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, in the <HI>trinitarian</HI> &s;en&s;e, by any thing a&s;&s;erted, or intimated in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s di&s;cour&s;e to them, we will admit the objection, and leave our adver&s;aries in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the advantage they can make of it. We may venture to do &s;o without the lea&s;t he&s;itation: for I de&s;ire it may be remembered in what manner, and by whom the Apo&s;tle was in|terrupted in his &s;ermon, if it may be called one. <HI>While Peter yet &s;pake the&s;e words,</HI> &s;ays the &s;acred writer, <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t fell on all them which heard the word. And they of the</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="103">
<HI>circumci&s;ion were a&s;toni&s;hed, for they heard them &s;peak with tongues, and magnify God.</HI> By this miraculous event therefore all farther endea|vours of the Apo&s;tle for the in&s;truction of the&s;e people were happily &s;uper&s;eded: they were, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> was, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly as it were, <HI>guided into all truth;</HI> and became be|lievers in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which he was one. Agreeably hereunto, when St. <HI>Peter re|hear&s;ed</HI> this matter, and <HI>expounded it by order to tho&s;e of the circumci&s;ion who contended with him,</HI> he tells them in the cour&s;e of his nar|ration, that <HI>as he</HI> BEGAN <HI>to &s;peak, the Holy Gho&s;t fell on them</HI> that heard him. After this, would it not be idle to in&s;i&s;t upon the inade|quatene&s;s of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s addre&s;s to the purpo&s;e of conver&s;ion in its utmo&s;t extent?</P>
<P>We read in the &s;equel of this, and in the following chapters, that the <HI>word was preached,</HI> that the <HI>hand of the Lord was with the&s;e preachers;</HI> that <HI>a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord; and that the word of God grew and multiplied.</HI> If the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions are compared with others &s;imilar to

<P>IN pro&s;ecution of the &s;ubject which en|gaged us la&s;t <HI>Sunday,</HI> I proceed to the account of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s impri&s;onment, and what followed upon it, which the &s;acred Hi&s;torian gives us in the 12th chapter of the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Peter</HI> was <HI>put in pri&s;on by Herod,</HI> it &s;eems, <HI>prayer was made without cea&s;ing of the church unto God for him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xii. 5.</NOTE>; and on the night before his intended execution, <HI>the Lord,</HI> we find, <HI>&s;ent his angel, and delivered him out</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="106">
<HI>of the hand of Herod,</HI> &amp;c. Now that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was <HI>the Lord that &s;ent his angel,</HI> ap|pears evident enough from the&s;e con&s;idera|tions. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is manife&s;tly de&s;igned by this title, for the mo&s;t part at lea&s;t, through this whole hi&s;tory. <HI>The Lord who delivered Peter by his angel</HI> was certainly the &s;ame <HI>Lord</HI> who afterwards &s;pake to <HI>Paul in the night by a vi&s;ion;</HI> and who, upon another occa&s;ion, <HI>&s;tood</HI> by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, and encouraged him, &amp;c. Now we &s;hould be glad to know, why the&s;e particulars are not to be regarded as equivalent to the appearances, and vi&s;ions, and deliverances <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dan. iii. 28. and chap. vi. 22.</NOTE>, which are &s;o frequent in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament;</HI> and, in that ca&s;e, I need not point out the con&s;equences they lead to.</P>
<P><HI>In the following chapter, we &s;ee</HI> Barnabas <HI>and</HI> Saul &s;ent forth <HI>by an immediate com|mi&s;&s;ion from the</HI> Holy Gho&s;t. The Holy Gho&s;t &s;aid, &s;eparate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 2.</NOTE>. So they being &s;ent forth by the Holy Gho&s;t, departed
<PB N="93" REF="107">
unto Seleucia, &amp;c. <HI>The pa&s;&s;age has been in|troduced before, and I leave it to the con&s;i|deration of every attentive and impartial hearer.</HI></P>
<P>The next occurrence is the conver&s;ion of the <HI>Deputy S. Paulus,</HI> who, we are informed, was a <HI>prudent man,</HI> and <HI>called for Barnabas and Saul, and de&s;ired to hear the word of God.</HI> And we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that our Apo&s;tles preached it to him at large, and laid before him the great my&s;teries of the Go&s;pel; and that he <HI>believed</HI> in the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, and was confirmed in his faith by the judgment which he &s;aw miraculou&s;ly inflicted by the <HI>hand of the Lord</HI> upon <HI>Ely|mas the &s;orcerer;</HI> being, as the &s;acred text expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>a&s;toni&s;hed at the doctrine of the Lord:</HI> the doctrine ju&s;t above &s;tyled the <HI>word of God.</HI></P>
<P>After this we find St. <HI>Paul</HI> preaching in the <HI>&s;ynagogue</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Antioch</HI> in <HI>Pi|&s;idia</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 16, &amp;c.</NOTE>Now the&s;e <HI>Jews,</HI> though they were
<PB N="94" REF="108">
not immediately concerned with them that dwelt at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in the proceedings again&s;t our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, were yet in all probability <HI>con&s;enting unto his death;</HI> as they could not all this while be unacquainted with his &s;tory, or &s;trangers to his preten&s;ions. The Apo&s;tle therefore adopts the &s;ame mode of argumentation which St. <HI>Peter</HI> had u&s;ed be|fore, in his &s;peech to the council, and lays the main &s;tre&s;s on the fundamental article of the re&s;urrection of our Lord from the dead. From the admi&s;&s;ion of this, the truth of the other great points of Chri&s;tianity mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily follow. And it &s;hould &s;eem that this di&s;cour&s;e of our Apo&s;tle had a con&s;ide|rable effect upon &s;ome of his audience; and indeed that others conceived the full force and import of the mo&s;t &s;triking particulars in it: for we read, that <HI>when the congrega|tion was broken up,</HI> many of the <HI>Jews</HI> and religious <HI>pro&s;elytes followed Paul and Barna|bas; who &s;peaking to them, per&s;uaded them to continue in the grace of God.</HI> And, by the way, this circum&s;tance may well be thought to imply, that the <HI>Spirit of grace</HI> had previ|ou&s;ly
<PB N="95" REF="109">
operated in their hearts to their entire conver&s;ion. But the <HI>next &s;abbath day,</HI> we are farther told, <HI>almo&s;t the whole city came together to hear the word of God;</HI> and the re&s;ult was, that the <HI>Jews, filled with envy, &s;pake again&s;t tho&s;e things which were &s;poken by Paul, contradicting and bla&s;pheming.</HI> I would ju&s;t a&s;k then, whether this BLASPHEMY does not help us to a very &s;trong pre&s;umptive proof of the &s;en&s;e in which the&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> un|der&s;tood <HI>the things which were &s;poken</HI> by the Apo&s;tle?</P>
<P><HI>Let us now attend</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas <HI>to</HI> Iconium; <HI>and &s;ee whether we may not rea|dily infer the nature of their doctrine from the &s;ucce&s;s of it there. In this place, we are informed,</HI> they abode long time, &s;peaking boldly in the <HI>LORD,</HI> which gave te&s;timony to the word of his grace, and granted &s;igns and won|ders to be done by their hands <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiv. 3, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. <HI>I would de|&s;ire you to compare the la&s;t clau&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age with the conclu&s;ion of St.</HI> Mark<HI>'s</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="110">
<HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> &s;o then after the <HI>LORD</HI> had &s;poken unto them, he was received up into heaven, &amp;c. and they went forth and preached; the <HI>LORD</HI> working with them, and confirming the word with &s;igns following; <HI>and with the twelfth ver&s;e of the next chapter;</HI> all the multitude kept &s;ilence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders <HI>GOD</HI> had wrought among&s;t the Gentiles by them; <HI>and with the following pa&s;&s;age in the Epi&s;tle to the</HI> Hebrews; how &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation; which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the <HI>LORD,</HI> and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; <HI>GOD</HI> al&s;o bearing them witne&s;s, both with &s;igns and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the <HI>HOLY GHOST,</HI> according to his own will <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>; <HI>I &s;ay, I could wi&s;h you to com|pare the&s;e &s;everal places; and, I believe I might venture to abide by the conclu&s;ions you will draw from them.</HI></P>
<P>We find our Apo&s;tles next at <HI>Ly&s;tra,</HI> where <HI>Paul</HI> cured the man that was <HI>impotent in his</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="111">
<HI>feet,</HI> &amp;c: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiv. 8, &amp;c.</NOTE>on the &s;ight of which miracle, <HI>the people lift up their voices, &s;aying, the gods are come down to us in the likene&s;s of men.</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this notion, the <HI>prie&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Jupiter brought oxen,</HI> and would <HI>have done &s;acrifice,</HI> &amp;c. This no &s;ooner came to the ears of <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul than they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, &s;irs, why do ye the&s;e things? We al&s;o are men of like pa&s;&s;ions with you, and preach unto you, that ye &s;hould turn from the&s;e vanities unto the living God, which made heaven and earth,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Now this was preci&s;ely the expo&s;tulation which the occa&s;ion demanded. The exi&s;tence of the one living and true God was to be a&s;|&s;erted to the&s;e idolatrous believers in a plu|rality of deities. At that time to have op|po&s;ed to their per&s;ua&s;ions doctrines peculiarly Chri&s;tian, would have been altogether pre|mature and un&s;ea&s;onable. It appears however that our Apo&s;tles had, before and after this, preached the&s;e doctrines at <HI>Ly&s;tra,</HI> and in the neighbourhood, with &s;ucce&s;s; though mo&s;t probably, for obvious rea&s;ons, not in the

hearing of tho&s;e that <HI>would have done &s;acrifice.</HI> For we read at the &s;ixth ver&s;e of this chapter, that, being <HI>ware</HI> of the de&s;ign of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> at <HI>Iconium to u&s;e them de&s;pitefully, &amp;c. they fled unto Ly&s;tra and Derbe,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>there they preached the Go&s;pel.</HI> And after the affair of the &s;acrifice, we are told, that <HI>there came to Ly&s;tra certain Jews from Antioch, who per&s;uaded the people, and having &s;toned Paul, drew him out of the city,</HI> &amp;c; that neverthele&s;s he revived, and &s;oon after <HI>preached the Go&s;pel at Derbe, and taught many, and returned again to Ly&s;tra, &amp;c, confirming the &s;ouls of the Di&s;|ciples, and exhorting them to continue in the &s;aith.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>We meet with nothing now that hath particular connexion with our argument, be|fore the conver&s;ions related in the &s;ixteenth chapter. Let us proceed then to the&s;e. At <HI>Troas,</HI> &s;ays the hi&s;tory, <HI>a vi&s;ion appeared to Paul in the night;</HI> from which he and <HI>Silas a&s;&s;uredly gathered that the Lord had called them to preach the Go&s;pel in Macedonia.</HI> Ob&s;erve
<PB N="99" REF="113">
then the account of the conver&s;ion of <HI>Lydia</HI> at <HI>Philippi. A certain woman named Lydia, which wor&s;hipped God, heard us: who&s;e heart the Lord opened, that &s;he attended unto the things which were &s;poken of Paul. And when &s;he was baptized, &s;he be&s;ought us, &s;aying, if ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my hou&s;e,</HI> &amp;c.

I would ju&s;t re|mark here, that this &s;y&s;tem is in no wi&s;e pre|judiced, either by the declaration of the <HI>dam&s;el po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;pirit of diviniation,</HI> who <HI>followed Paul</HI> and his companions, <HI>and cried, &s;aying, the&s;e men are the &s;ervants of the mo&s;t high God, which &s;hew unto us the way of Sal|vation;</HI>

<PB N="112" REF="126">
<HI>the whole of this pa&s;&s;age to every judicious and impartial reader's thorough con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P>We will now attend this great Apo&s;tle to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> where we find him violently at|tacked by the <HI>Jews which were of A&s;ia, who &s;tirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, crying out, men of I&s;rael help, this is the man that teacheth all men every where again&s;t the people and the law,</HI> &amp;c.

Only I will add here, that the ob&s;ervation then made is much con|firmed by the circum&s;tance of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>pu|rifying</HI> him&s;elf at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with the <HI>four men who had a vow on them,</HI> agreeably to the ad|vice before given by the judaizing Chri&s;tians, and in exact conformity to the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> con|&s;titution. But if we turn to what the Apo&s;tle has to &s;ay in his own defence, we &s;hall find <NOTE PLACE="foot">* Acts xxi. 27, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<PB N="113" REF="127">
his apology to contain an account of his con|ver&s;ion, and of his Apo&s;tolical commi&s;&s;ion in con&s;equence of it; which &s;trengthens much what has been remarked relative to the charge brought again&s;t him. It is ob&s;ervable, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> calls him&s;elf here a <HI>Jew</HI> in the very &s;ame breath almo&s;t in which he avows him|&s;elf a Chri&s;tian. He admits his hearers to be <HI>zealous towards God, according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>though he plainly intimates all the while that they were erroneou&s;ly or blindly zealous, or, as he el&s;e|where expre&s;&s;es it, that their <HI>zeal of God was not according to knowlege.</HI> He does not undervalue or vilify the law, and much le&s;s pronounce it to be <HI>void,</HI> and of <HI>none effect,</HI> though he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a preacher of the Go&s;pel. Neither the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> nor tho&s;e of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;trangers to the NEW DOCTRINE which he taught under that character: &s;o that we are not at a lo&s;s to know the nature and import of the te&s;timony which he bore concerning his Divine Ma&s;ter. Be&s;ide, we are to remember, that he was in|terrupted
<PB N="114" REF="128">
in the cour&s;e of his harangue, and precluded from enlarging his &s;peech, or ex|patiating on his doctrine, (which otherwi&s;e perhaps he might have done,) by the cla|mours and outrage of a giddy and incen&s;ed multitude.</P>
<P>We &s;ee him next before the <HI>chief prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>council;</HI> in which &s;ituation he politicly takes advantage of the difference of &s;entiment between them that compo&s;ed it: the <HI>one part</HI> being <HI>Sadducees,</HI> and <HI>the other Phari&s;ees.</HI> The Apo&s;tle openly declares him&s;elf a <HI>Phari&s;ee;</HI> in which plea his immediate view was mani|fe&s;tly to his own pre&s;ervation; though ulti|mately he had doubtle&s;s an eye to the con|ver&s;ion of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and re&s;pec|table part of his audience, by tacitly at lea&s;t referring to the re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and the important con&s;equences nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from it.</P>
<P>In much the &s;ame light we may regard his apology for him&s;elf before <HI>Felix</HI> in the <NOTE PLACE="foot">&dagger; Acts xxiii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<PB N="115" REF="129">
following Chapter. Under one article of his accu&s;ation he is charged with being <HI>a ring|leader of the &s;ect of the Nazarenes;</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 5, &amp;c.</NOTE>or, as the <HI>A&s;iatic Jews</HI> had expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, with <HI>teaching men every where again&s;t the law;</HI> or, in the words of the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Achaia,</HI> with <HI>per&s;uading men to wor&s;hip God contrary to the law;</HI> and under another article he is traduced as a <HI>mover of Sedition,</HI> and a di&s;turber of the public peace. Now there is &s;omething ob|&s;ervably dexterous in our Apo&s;tle's reply to all this; in which he partly denies the charge, profe&s;&s;es his innocence, and defies them to <HI>prove the things whereof they accu&s;e him;</HI> and partly a&s;&s;erts the cau&s;e he had e&s;pou&s;ed, and in general terms acknowleges his Chri&s;tian principles. In this, as in the preceding ca&s;e, there is fine addre&s;s in the Apo&s;tle's endeavour to intere&s;t his auditors on the &s;ide of Chri&s;tianity, by repre&s;enting its profe&s;&s;ors as holding one common tenet with the <HI>&s;traite&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t popular &s;ect of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> religion; while at the &s;ame time he was indirectly <HI>preaching through Je&s;us the</HI>

<HI>re&s;urrection from the dead,</HI> and by nece&s;&s;ary implication maintaining the great my&s;tery of the Chri&s;tian Faith. <HI>Felix,</HI> we find, was far from being unacquainted with at lea&s;t &s;ome of the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, and re&s;erved the matter for a farther hearing; but in the interim he, with his wife <HI>Dru&s;illa, which was a Jewe&s;s,</HI> &s;ent for <HI>Paul</HI> privately, and <HI>heard him concerning the faith in Chri&s;t.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 24, &amp;c.</NOTE>It does not appear that our Apo&s;tle on this occa&s;ion di&s;|cour&s;ed on any one article of faith, &s;trictly and peculiarly Chri&s;tian. <HI>He rea&s;oned of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, temperance, and judgment to come,</HI> till this iniquitous governor <HI>trembled;</HI> and pro|bably had proceeded to the full di&s;play of all evangelical truth, had he not been ab|ruptly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.

Many of the foregoing remarks may be applied to the defence made afterwards by our Apo&s;tle before king <HI>Agrippa and Fe&s;tus</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>. I think it unnece&s;&s;ary therefore to cite it.

And that this was a much more judicious mode of conviction than the direct or po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion of all, or any of tho&s;e truths could have been, I pre|&s;ume, I need not &s;tay to prove.</P>
<P>When St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ome time after this <HI>ex|pounded and te&s;tified the kingdom of God to the Jews at Rome, per&s;uading them concerning Je|&s;us both out of the law of Mo&s;es, and out of the</HI>

<P>This minute and circum&s;tantial &s;urvey of the hi&s;tory of the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> &s;o far as it is connected with our pre&s;ent &s;ubject, will, I apprehend, throw much light upon the &s;ame.

alluded to, and not &s;y&s;tematically, but uni|formly taught. The doctrine of the&s;e Fa|thers is delivered in the &s;pirit of &s;implicity; it appears plainly to have been the &s;tanding doctrine of the Church; nor is there a &s;ingle circum&s;tance that will incline us to &s;u&s;pect them of a de&s;ign to obtrude their own pri|vate opinions, or conceits, upon the Chri&s;tian world. This to me &s;eems demon&s;trable from a very ob&s;ervable particular; which is, that in their writings they do not cite all, or the principal texts which are adduced in main|tenance of the doctrine of the Trinity, but a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame in other terms, and in lan|guage fully equivalent. They evidently con|&s;idered it, not as requiring proof, but de|&s;erving illu&s;tration. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> in the intro|duction to his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> &s;alutes them <Q>according to the will of the Father, and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t our</HI> GOD.</Q> The &s;ame Fa|ther wi&s;hes the <HI>Romans</HI> to <Q>permit him to imitate the pa&s;&s;ion of his GOD;</Q> or, of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> his GOD, as it &s;tands in the Original.

<P>It is true, as the learned tran&s;lator acknow|ledges, this &s;econd Epi&s;tle, was neither held in &s;o much reverence by the ancients, nor is &s;o generally received among the moderns, as the fir&s;t; and, it is certain, St. <HI>Jerome, Photius,</HI> and <HI>Archbi&s;hop U&s;her</HI> after them, concur in endeavouring to repre&s;ent it as a &s;purious production.

rai&s;ed by the&s;e illu&s;trious per&s;onages, does not lie in the doctrine &s;o explicitly contained in it, and at the &s;ame time &s;o con&s;onant to the &s;entiments of the apo&s;tolical fathers, I &s;ee no manner of nece&s;&s;ity for retracting the&s;e quotations. Whoever the author might be, we have his clear &s;en&s;e of the matter.</P>
<P>The charge of credulity brought again&s;t many of the Fathers by a late celebrated Author, with vehemency of zeal, and in the dialect of virulence, even admitting it to be well founded, cannot ju&s;tly be thought to affect in the lea&s;t the validity of the&s;e pri|mitive and plain te&s;timonies to the great truths of the Go&s;pel, as they <HI>are mo&s;t &s;urely believed among us.</HI> There is not, I am confi|dent, one circum&s;tance to colour a charge of this nature again&s;t the Fathers from whom we have been drawing our evidence, except that of the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> by which, as we &s;hall &s;ee, St. <HI>Clement</HI> illu&s;trates the doctrine of the re&s;urrection. And ample &s;atisfaction will be given on that head in its proper place. <HI>(o)</HI></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="138">
To the&s;e te&s;timonies we might &s;ubjoin tho&s;e of <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr, Athenagoras, Ire|naeus,</HI> and a number of others; the weight of who&s;e collected evidence will be found in|finitely to preponderate all that has perver&s;ely been alledged to its di&s;credit from writers of a &s;ub&s;equent date, and minor authority. <HI>(p)</HI> This in due time will fully appear.</P>
<P>Now, if in all this doctrine we can &s;ee nothing like a formulary, or &s;y&s;tem, we &s;ee however from whence <HI>confe&s;&s;ions of faith</HI> may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to have origi|nated, and by what at this day they may be mo&s;t ju&s;tly defended. Suppo&s;ing the fir&s;t rule of faith to have been purely the bap|ti&s;mal form; or, agreeing with Dr. <HI>Sykes,</HI> that the <Q>very &s;hort Creed which at fir&s;t was deemed &s;ufficient to entitle men to bap|ti&s;m, was no other than a faith in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> his Son our Lord, and in the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t;</HI></Q> even admitting this, we cannot &s;urely have recour&s;e to better or &s;ounder authority than that which has been

laid before you, in order to know exactly what <HI>this faith</HI> implies. It will be hard in|deed if the Apo&s;tles, and the&s;e Apo&s;tolical Fathers, &s;hould be all along teaching he|re&s;y, while they perpetually and earne&s;tly, though not formally or methodically, com|plain of, and expatiate again&s;t it.</P>
<P>But I have yet farther to ob&s;erve, that the &s;en&s;e of antiquity, and the faith of the primitive Church, may be inferred from &s;uch circum&s;tantial evidence as has never, that I know of, been profe&s;&s;edly produced, but yet, I tru&s;t, will be allowed to come little if at all &s;hort of demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>The infamous reproach which was ca&s;t upon the whole Chri&s;tian name by its fir&s;t enemies, is a circum&s;tance of a particular a&s;pect to our purpo&s;e. Chri&s;tianity was called emphatically THE ATHEISM. <HI>(q)</HI> Now I own I cannot help con&s;idering this equally horrid and ridiculous imputation as nece&s;&s;arily im|porting the primitive Chri&s;tians to have wor|&s;hipped <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> as ONE with the Father,
<PB N="126" REF="140">
or as "very God of very God" from all eter|nity. For nothing le&s;s than &s;uch wor&s;hip will account for the charge either from <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles.</HI> It might naturally be con&s;idered by both as a kind of dethroning of the ONE SUPREME GOD. But every modern unbe|liever will readily agree with me, that the idea of inferiority and delegation, &amp;c. is far from being irreconcileable with <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> te|nets, or with known principles of Poly|thei&s;m. <HI>(r)</HI></P>
<P>According to the <HI>Apo&s;tolical con&s;titutions,</HI> as we learn from an eminent author, it was cu&s;tomary for the prie&s;t, after <HI>amen</HI> &s;olemnly pronounced by the communicants in the holy &s;acrament, to cry out with a loud voice <GAP DESC="foreign">

<P>In his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on Epictetus, Arrian</HI> (as Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins</HI> ob&s;erves) <Q>a&s;&s;ures us, that in his time, (which was about an hundred and tweny years after Chri&s;t,) it was an u&s;ual form in the prayers of the heathen to &s;ay <GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;<HI>Lord have mercy upon us;</HI> whereby they did acknow|lege the <HI>unity</HI> of God, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip; which clau&s;e, he adds, is thought to have been from that u&s;age taken into the Li|turgy of Chri&s;tians.</Q></P>
<P>Now, if this be admitted, I would re|mark, that as the title of <HI>Lord</HI> confe&s;&s;edly belongs to our Saviour, the Chri&s;tians may fairly be &s;uppo&s;ed, in their triple form of ejaculatory addre&s;s,&mdash;<HI>Lord, have mercy upon us; Chri&s;t, have mercy upon us; Lord, have mercy us;</HI> to invoke <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the <HI>Lord,</HI> as &s;u|preme <HI>God:</HI> or if by <HI>Lord</HI> we are in the fir&s;t

<P>In confirmation of what has been offered, I de&s;ire to add one or two more facts, which, if I mi&s;take not, have more weight in them than is commonly apprehended; as, for in|&s;tance, the appointment of the <HI>Lord's day;</HI> and the &s;tyle or title <GAP DESC="foreign"> by which churches were in the primitive times di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.

<P>I &s;hall conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with re|minding you of a circum&s;tance, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more deci&s;ive: I mean the <HI>Unitarian</HI> doctrine which is &s;o copiou&s;ly, and &s;o em|phatically inculcated in the <HI>Koran</HI> of <HI>Ma|homet.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>Of the per&s;on of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in his prophetical character, this arch impo&s;tor &s;peaks in terms the mo&s;t re&s;pectable. <Q>God, &s;ays he, gave miracles to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Mary,</HI> and &s;trengthened him with the Holy Spirit, &amp;c. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;aid in the cradle, verily I am the &s;ervant of God. This was <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Mary, (s)</HI> the word of truth, &amp;c. Verily God promi&s;eth thee a &s;on, named <HI>John,</HI> (&s;ays the angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> to <HI>Zechariah,</HI> according to the <HI>Koran,)</HI> who &s;hall bear witne&s;s to the WORD, which cometh from God, an honourable per&s;on, cha&s;te, and one of the righteous prophets.</Q> To do honour to the author of
<PB N="130" REF="144">
Chri&s;tianity in this capacity, <HI>Mahomet</HI> po&s;i|tively a&s;&s;erts, that <Q>they (the <HI>Jews)</HI> &s;lew him not, neither crucified him; but that he was repre&s;ented by one in his likene&s;s. They did not really kill him, &s;ays he, but God took him up unto him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to our Lord's Divinity, or equality with the Father, you have, among a thou&s;and parallel ones, the &s;entiments fol|lowing. <Q>They (viz. the Chri&s;tians) &s;ay, God hath begotten children; God forbid. It is not meet for God that he &s;hould have any &s;on; God forbid. Ble&s;&s;ed be he that hath revealed the <HI>Forkan,</HI> (Koran,) to whom belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth; who hath begotten no i&s;&s;ue, and hath no partner in his kingdom, &amp;c. Yet have they taken other Gods be&s;ides him, which have created nothing, but are them&s;elves created, &amp;c. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is no other than a &s;ervant whom we favoured with the gift of prophecy, &amp;c. When <HI>Je&s;us</HI> came with evident miracles, he &s;aid, now am I come unto you with wi&s;dom, and to ex|plain
<PB N="131" REF="145">
unto you part of tho&s;e things concerning which ye di&s;agree; wherefore fear God, and obey me. Verily God is my Lord, and your Lord; wherefore wor|&s;hip him. He is God, be&s;ides whom there is no God, &amp;c. Far be God exalted above the idols which they a&s;&s;ociate with him. The 112th. ch. of the <HI>Koran</HI> is entitled <HI>the declaration of God's Unity,</HI> and the whole runs thus: Say God is one God; <HI>(t)</HI> the eternal God; he begetteth not, neither is he begotten; and there is not any like unto him. In the 6th. ch. is the following que&s;tion: How &s;hould he have i&s;&s;ue, &s;ince he hath no con&s;ort?</Q></P>
<P>That the&s;e carnal &s;entiments, this gro&s;s language, (the language of infidels and &s;cof|fers every day,) is directly levelled, not at a <HI>new</HI> or <HI>&s;trange</HI> thing; not at a peculiar tenet of a few enthu&s;ia&s;ts; or a particular &s;ect of Chri&s;tians; but at the leading article, the fundamental principle of our religion, may be affirmed in utter defiance of the united powers of effrontery and equivocation. The

<P>HAVING, I tru&s;t, already beyond all rea&s;onable doubt a&s;certained the ab&s;o|lute Divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>by many infal|lible proofs</HI> from holy writ, and by other arguments of a nature little le&s;s demon&s;tra|tive, I &s;cruple not to &s;et the words ju&s;t read to you in the front of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, as plainly declarative of this great doctrine, though, &s;ingly and &s;eparately con&s;idered, they may not, on a critical review of the whole ver&s;e, be altogether unliable to cavil, or, if

you plea&s;e, to exception. And I hope very much to &s;trengthen what has been advanced by &s;hewing the repugnancy of anti-trinita|rian principles to the genius and de&s;ign of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation; or, in other words, by proving that, if we &s;olely or chiefly regard our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour under any character inferior to that of the <HI>true God,</HI> our highe&s;t ideas will come infinitely &s;hort both of the dignity of his Per&s;on, and the nature and end of his Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>By affecting the common appellation of <HI>Unitarians,</HI> modern unbelievers, as well the followers of <HI>Socinus</HI> as the di&s;ciples of <HI>Arius,</HI> (who again may be ranged under many more cla&s;&s;es than one,) appear in &s;ome &s;ort to be a&s;hamed of the leaders of their re&s;pective here&s;ies, and to de&s;ert the captains under who&s;e banners they fight.

This is only my conjecture.</Q></P>
<P>Now I beg leave to a&s;k, whether our an|notator was under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of conjecturing? Conjectures, I pre&s;ume, are
<PB N="183" REF="198">
never admi&s;&s;ible in critici&s;m, but when they clear the &s;en&s;e of an author from ob&s;curity; or when direct ab&s;urdities, or con&s;iderable difficulties are removed by them. Is either of the&s;e ca&s;es the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent? So far from it, that unle&s;s we are to &s;acrifice &s;en&s;e to figure, and real truth to ideal climax, I affirm without ceremony the old and uni|ver&s;al reading to be the only right one; and that this pa&s;&s;age, abundantly plain and con|&s;i&s;tent in it&s;elf, is here ob&s;cured by elucida|tion, and marred by amendment. Mr. T. in fact &s;mothers him&s;elf in a du&s;t of his own rai&s;ing. For though, in a &s;pirit of true com|pa&s;&s;ion, and in the tendere&s;t affection to his brethren, &amp;c. the Apo&s;tle calls to mind their national character, and many of the privi|leges they had enjoyed, yet at the time of his writing this Epi&s;tle, it &s;hould be remem|bered, that their grand privilege of all, as our author ju&s;tly terms it, that which the <HI>Jews</HI> con&s;tantly made their boa&s;t of, and <Q>which was indeed the glory of all their glories,</Q> was ab&s;olutely lo&s;t, and irreco|verably <HI>done away</HI> for ever. God was no longer
<PB N="184" REF="199">
<HI>their</HI> God in any &s;en&s;e favourable to them; they were di&s;owned; they were <HI>cut off</HI> by him, to u&s;e St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s words in another place; the believing <HI>Gentiles</HI> were now <Q>more nearly related to him;</Q> <HI>they</HI> were <HI>purified</HI> to be a <HI>peculiar people;</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> as <HI>Jews,</HI> had no manner of intere&s;t in the new di&s;pen&s;ation: &s;o that, according to this author's con&s;truc|tion, the Apo&s;tle fal&s;ifies fact, and in&s;ults his <HI>kin&s;men,</HI> by way of commi&s;eration.</P>
<P>There is another text which the &s;ame au|thor handles not le&s;s to his own di&s;advantage. <HI>Every hou&s;e is builded by &s;ome man,</HI> &s;ays the writer of the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Ch. iii. 4. <HI>but he that built all things is God.</HI> Mr. T's. paraphra&s;e is as follows. <Q>When he &s;aith, <HI>every hou&s;e is builded by &s;ome per&s;on, but he who built all things is God,</HI> he evidently di&s;tingui&s;hes between a <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> and <HI>Supreme</HI> builder. But this di&s;tinction he needed not to have mentioned, had he not &s;poke of a <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> builder before. For, if in the ca&s;e under con&s;ideration, there be no <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> builder at all, this di&s;|tinction
<PB N="185" REF="200">
is nothing to his purpo&s;e. Then his argument would have been; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t build the hou&s;e; becau&s;e no one could build it but he; &s;eeing no hou&s;e is built by any but God. Whereas, contra|riwi&s;e, he a&s;&s;erts a <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> builder, and tells us &s;uch a one is con&s;i&s;tent with God's being the <HI>Supreme</HI> original builder.</Q></P>
<P>Now, I take it, this is a mere fanciful di&s;|tinction of Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s own brain. The context runs thus. <HI>This man was counted worthy of more glory than Mo&s;es, ina&s;much as he who hath builded the hou&s;e, hath more honour than the hou&s;e: for every hou&s;e is builded by &s;ome man, but he that built all things is God.</HI> Surely he <HI>that built all things,</HI> he who made the world was the very Per&s;on or Being that <HI>built the hou&s;e,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it; i. e. who founded the whole <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> OEco|nomy, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil; and con&s;e|quently, though <HI>every hou&s;e is builded by &s;ome man,</HI> though every in&s;titution, &amp;c. has &s;ome author, and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in particular may be &s;aid to be a founder in a &s;econdary &s;en&s;e, <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="201">
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;trictly and properly the Supreme Architect, as we may &s;ay, as well in the one as the other of the above in&s;tances, to the total exclu&s;ion of every idea of <HI>&s;ubordination.</HI> And &s;o this very pa&s;&s;age in effect plainly a&s;&s;erts our Saviour's Divinity, and confirms the <HI>Supremacy</HI> this Gentleman appears to be extremely forward to de&s;troy by it. It is re|markable enough that the texts under con&s;i|deration have been before now a <HI>&s;nare</HI> to un|believers. For the <HI>Socinian</HI> glo&s;s on them is, <Q>that Chri&s;t is as much more excellent than <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> as God is more excellent than his own people;</Q> and this &s;uperexcellence is on all hands allowed not to come one jot &s;hort of ab&s;olute infinity.</P>

<PB N="192" REF="207">
affords a &s;trong proof of the co|equality of the two Per&s;ons; and that it is quoted accordingly by Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> in his trea|ti&s;e <HI>de vera Chri&s;ti deitate.</HI> But as this can only be done by help of the above di&s;tinction, I mu&s;t a&s;k, why <HI>Novatian's</HI> &s;en&s;e of this text mu&s;t be admitted as the true one? He did not <HI>affect,</HI> &s;ay &s;ome, did not <HI>claim,</HI> did not <HI>take upon him,</HI> &amp;c. to be honoured as God. Notwith&s;tanding the great authorities of <HI>Grotius, Tillot&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Clarke,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Parkhur&s;t's Note at p. 79 of his Treati&s;e on the Divinity and Pre-exi&s;tence of our Saviour.</NOTE>with which this interpretation is fortified, I can|not help thinking the reading in u&s;e, <HI>thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</HI> not barely to be the more eligible, but indeed the pro|per reading. For, not to in&s;i&s;t on one cir|cum&s;tance in its favour, which is the non|agreement of the &s;everal interpretations of the learned Gentlemen above-mentioned, it de&s;erves to be noted, that though the phra&s;e <GAP DESC="foreign"> would admit the con&s;truc|tion contended for, yet the context will be found ab&s;olutely to revolt again&s;t it. Grant|ing the phra&s;e <HI>being in the form of God</HI> to be
<PB N="193" REF="208">
in it&s;elf of undeterminate &s;ignification, yet when predicated of him who is <HI>one</HI> with the <HI>Father,</HI> who <HI>was in the beginning with God,</HI> and really and truly <HI>was God,</HI> it certainly is to be regarded as &s;ynonymous with tho&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions; and con&s;equently as importing an in|tire equality with God.

The <HI>Socinian</HI> and the <HI>Arian</HI> inference from the&s;e texts is obvious; but in proof that it is an unfair one, I would remark, that had St. <HI>Paul</HI> intended here to have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the <HI>Father</HI> from the <HI>Son</HI> and the

<P>THAT important article of our Creeds, the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Body,</HI> is the other great <HI>my&s;tery</HI> which has all along been <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> to Infidels, and a <HI>&s;tumbling-block</HI> to many Chri&s;tians.

<P>I might in&s;i&s;t that the great doctrine before us is virtually at lea&s;t contained in my text:
<PB N="204" REF="219">
but as there is a &s;trong propen&s;ity in human pride to con&s;ider what is propounded to our faith as in&s;ulting our under&s;tandings, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a full and even minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>A late ingenious author, Dr. <HI>Sykes,</HI> very confidently a&s;&s;erts, that this doctrine has no manner of warrant from &s;criptural authority.

<PB N="205" REF="220">
it to your content, if not by recency of argument, or reply, at lea&s;t by the mode of their enforcement.</P>
<P>Now that the above expre&s;&s;ions or phra&s;es,&mdash;the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the body,</HI> or <HI>the fle&s;h,</HI> never occur in the New Te&s;tament; that this article, together with &s;ome others which Dr. <HI>S.</HI> mentions, did not make a part of the <HI>Bapti&s;mal Creed</HI> before the middle of the fourth century, may without difficulty be admitted; becau&s;e if it will appear, that the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the body,</HI> or <HI>of the fle&s;h,</HI> is mo&s;t unque&s;tionably the doctrine of Scrip|ture, and of the Apo&s;tolical and primitive Church, we are bound by all means to retain it; and its in&s;ertion into the <HI>Creed</HI> at <HI>any</HI> time was both proper and nece&s;&s;ary; the original <HI>Creed,</HI> whatever it preci&s;ely was, having been rea&s;onably enlarged, (by Dr. <HI>S</HI>'s own confe&s;&s;ion), as circum&s;tances de|manded, and here&s;ies multiplied.</P>
<P>Let us enquire then, whether the doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> as it is delivered in our
<PB N="206" REF="221">
<HI>Creeds,</HI> be not founded in evidence rational, &s;criptural, and irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider this doctrine as a matter of opinion, and not of faith, we &s;hall find it to have countenance in no contemptible autho|rity. Tho' the heathens &s;aw <HI>&s;piritual things</HI> in general thro' a dim <HI>gla&s;s</HI> indeed; tho' the pro&s;pect of futurity was greatly clouded to a world almo&s;t wholly corrupt in principle, and abandoned in practice, yet the notion of another &s;tate, and even of a <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> or of a <HI>renovation</HI> of all things, which is a <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> in effect, was far from being univer&s;ally ex|ploded, as ab&s;olutely ridiculous, or chimeri|cal. We are a&s;&s;ured <HI>Zorou&s;tres</HI> taught the doctrine of the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> among the antient <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> as he him&s;elf derived it mo&s;t pro|bably from the <HI>Jews,</HI> with whom he had communications. <HI>Grotius,</HI> who, with re&s;|pect to this article at lea&s;t, was not of <HI>doubt|ful mind,</HI> in proof of the admi&s;&s;ible po&s;&s;ibi|lity of the thing, cites the authorities both of hi&s;torians and philo&s;ophers, and affirms it to have been the tenet of almo&s;t the whole &s;ect of the Stoics. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Grotius de vent. l. 7. and 10.

<P>That the notion of a <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> accord|ing to the common acceptation of the term, prevailed among the <HI>Jews</HI> in our Saviour's time, will be &s;oon manife&s;t from certain occurrences and pa&s;&s;ages in the evangelical writings. St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his apology before King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> affirms it to have its founda|tion in the <HI>hope of the promi&s;e made unto the Fathers:</HI> tho' when, where, or in what man|ner, he mentions not. And certain it is that the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> the <HI>&s;traite&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t
<PB N="209" REF="224">
con&s;iderable <HI>Sect</HI> among them, not only en|tertained this notion with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, but contended for it with vehemency; as ap|pears from the violence of oppo&s;ition be|tween them and the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> who as &s;tre|nuou&s;ly denied it. What then did both parties under&s;tand by it? Let us, for a re&s;olution of this que&s;tion, turn fir&s;t to the account which the evangeli&s;ts give us of a di&s;cour&s;e held by the <HI>Sadducees</HI> with our Saviour, on the &s;ubject of the <HI>Re&s;urrection. The &s;ame day,</HI> &s;ays St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and much in the &s;ame words, St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> after him, <HI>came to him the Sadducees, who &s;ay that there is no Re&s;urrection, and a&s;ked him, &s;aying, Ma&s;ter, Mo&s;es &s;aid, if a man die having no children, his brother &s;hall marry his wife, and rai&s;e up &s;eed unto his brother: now there were with us &s;even brethren; and the fir&s;t when he had married a wife, decea&s;ed; and having no i&s;&s;ue left his wife to his brother; likewi&s;e the &s;econd al&s;o, and the third, to the &s;eventh. And la&s;t of all, the woman died al&s;o. Therefore in the Re&s;urrection who&s;e wife &s;hall &s;he be of the &s;even, for they all</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="225">
<HI>had her.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. 22. 23. &amp;c.</NOTE>The argument herein implied is indeed perfectly ridiculous, and gro&s;&s;ly car|nal; and is expo&s;ed accordingly by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in his reply to it: but it unde|niably &s;uppo&s;es the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> of the <HI>bodies</HI> of the&s;e &s;ame <HI>brethren</HI> and their <HI>wife,</HI> agre|ably to the <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> hypothe&s;is. Indeed that very reply plainly &s;uppo&s;es the &s;ame thing. <HI>Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the re&s;urrection they neither marry, nor are given in marri|age, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</HI> All this is abundantly confirmed by our Saviour's own argument immediately follow|ing. <HI>As touching the re&s;urrection of the dead, have you not read that which was &s;poken to you by God, &s;aying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</HI> There is neither connection, nor indeed &s;en&s;e in this portion of &s;cripture|hi&s;tory, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e the re-union of the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> and <HI>bodies</HI> of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> &amp;c. in the <HI>re&s;urrection;</HI> and that our Sa|viour
<PB N="211" REF="226">
meant by implication to a&s;&s;ert it. For his argument directly proves nothing more than the immortality of the &s;oul, and its con&s;equential exi&s;tence in a future &s;tate. But had this proof been the &s;ole object of his di&s;cour&s;e, he would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly have ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a very different manner upon the occa&s;ion. Our Lord's meaning is yet more fully di&s;covered by St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s ac|count of this matter. <HI>Now that the dead are rai&s;ed,</HI> &s;ays he, according to that Evangeli&s;t, EVEN <HI>Mo&s;es &s;hewed at the bu&s;h,</HI> &s;aying, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again: When our Lord told <HI>Martha,</HI> that her <HI>brother,</HI> newly decea&s;ed, &s;hould <HI>ri&s;e again, &s;he &s;aid unto him,</HI> &s;ays the &s;acred text, <HI>I know that he &s;hall ri&s;e again in the re&s;urrec|tion at the la&s;t day.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xi. 24.</NOTE>Now that <HI>Martha</HI> be|lieved her <HI>brother &s;hould ri&s;e again at the la&s;t day</HI> with that <HI>body</HI> which was laid in the grave, and had been <HI>dead four days,</HI> is evi|dent enough from this con&s;ideration; that, though &s;he appears to have been doubtful of the po&s;&s;ibility of his re&s;urrection at <HI>that</HI> time,
<PB N="212" REF="227">
and in &s;o <HI>extraordinary</HI> a way, <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>by this time he &s;tinketh,</HI> and this notwith|&s;tanding <HI>her</HI> avowed belief that <HI>what&s;oever</HI> our Saviour would <HI>a&s;k of God, God would give it</HI> him, and <HI>his</HI> declaration that he was him|&s;elf <HI>the re&s;urrection and the life,</HI> yet when <HI>Lazarus</HI> actually <HI>came forth,</HI> neither &s;he nor the many <HI>Jews</HI> who were pre&s;ent &s;hewed the lea&s;t &s;ign of amazement. It does not appear that they were in any degree a&s;toni&s;hed at this mode of his re&s;toration to life; and there|fore we may ju&s;tly pre&s;ume they were per|&s;uaded that <HI>in the re&s;urrection at the la&s;t day</HI> "all men &s;hall ri&s;e again with their bodies," through the operation of that omnipotent power which, <HI>in the twinkling of an eye,</HI> is able to in&s;pire life and vigour into du&s;t and a&s;hes, and animate corruption it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> may be con&s;idered in the &s;ame point of view. <HI>Herod,</HI> hearing of the <HI>fame of Je|&s;us, &s;aid unto his &s;ervants,</HI> as the Evangeli&s;t acquaints us, <HI>this is John the Bapti&s;t, he is ri&s;en from the dead, and therefore mighty</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="228">
<HI>works do &s;hew forth them&s;elves in him. Herod</HI> hardly thought the&s;e <HI>works</HI> were done by the &s;pirit or apparition of the <HI>Bapti&s;t;</HI> and if not, we mu&s;t conclude that he believed him to be ri&s;en indeed, according to the notions entertained by the <HI>Jews.</HI> The &s;acred hi&s;|tory informs us the <HI>Sadducees</HI> were <HI>grieved</HI> that the Apo&s;tles <HI>preached through Je&s;us the re&s;urrection from the dead.</HI> And is it not as plain as implication can make it, that their doctrine was, that the followers of Je&s;us, and indeed all men, &s;hould be rai&s;ed in like manner as he was?</P>
<P>The truth is, of this kind of implied evi|dence we have plenty in the &s;acred volume. I will only produce one piece more of Go&s;|pel-hi&s;tory, in pre&s;umptive proof that <HI>Gen|tiles</HI> as well as <HI>Jews</HI> under&s;tood by a <HI>re&s;ur|rection</HI> what we do at this day. St. <HI>Paul</HI> concludes his di&s;cour&s;e to the <HI>Athenians</HI> with in&s;i&s;ting on the certainty of a future judg|ment from the <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> which God had <HI>given to all men</HI> of it, by his having <HI>rai&s;ed that man, whom he had ordained to be their judge,</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="229">
<HI>from the dead. And when they heard of the re|&s;urrection of the dead,</HI> &s;ays the hi&s;torian, <HI>&s;ome mocked;</HI> but <HI>others &s;aid, we will hear thee again of this matter.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 32.</NOTE>Now St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s audi|ence con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of <HI>Stoics</HI> and <HI>Epicu|reans;</HI> and the latter mo&s;t undoubtedly were the party that derided the doctrine which the former did not conceive to be altogether ex|travagant, or ridiculous. But had the Apo&s;|tle meant only to inculcate the general doc|trine of a future &s;tate, the <HI>Stoics</HI> in all pro|bability would have been &s;atisfied as to that point without a farther hearing; and the <HI>Epicureans</HI> would have no more <HI>mocked,</HI> or in&s;ulted, than if a <HI>Stoic</HI> had preached it.</P>
<P>Indeed there is one circum&s;tance in the evangelical hi&s;tory which at fir&s;t glance may be thought to militate again&s;t what has been laid before you. When our Saviour <HI>came down from the mountain</HI> after his <HI>Transfigura|tion,</HI> with <HI>Peter, James, and John, and charged them that they &s;hould tell no man what things they had &s;een, till the Son of man were ri&s;en</HI>
<PB N="215" REF="230">
<HI>from the dead, they kept that &s;aying with them|&s;elves, que&s;tioning one with another, what the ri&s;ing from the dead &s;hould mean.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark ix. 10.</NOTE>But that they could not po&s;&s;ibly doubt what was to be under&s;tood by the expre&s;&s;ion, or the thing it&s;elf, is demon&s;trable from preceding con|&s;iderations; and therefore the ca&s;e mu&s;t have been this. They were perplexed with the account our Lord had given of him&s;elf; they could not conceive how their Ma&s;ter, whom they &s;till regarded as a temporal deliverer, &s;hould &s;uffer and be put to an ignominious death, (as he had a&s;&s;ured them he &s;hould in the 31^s^t v. of the la&s;t Chapter;) or how the expected deliverance would be effected by, or after &s;uch re&s;urrection: this was probably the &s;ubject of their enquiry; they <HI>que&s;tioned one with another,</HI> not what THE, but what HIS <HI>ri&s;ing from the dead &s;hould mean.</HI> All this is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with a parallel pa&s;&s;age in St. <HI>Luke. He took unto him the twelve, and &s;aid unto them, Behold, we go up to Je|ru&s;alem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man &s;hall be ac|compli&s;hed.</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="231">
<HI>For he &s;hall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and &s;hall be mocked, and &s;pitefully in|treated and &s;pitted on; and they &s;hall &s;courge him, and put him to death: and the third day he &s;hall ri&s;e again. And they under&s;tood none of the&s;e things: and this &s;aying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were &s;poken.</HI> Luke xviii. 31.</P>
<P>What has already been advanced will ob|viate a common a&s;&s;ertion, or in&s;inuation, that there is a very material difference between the ca&s;e of a body which has been dead a few days, or months, or even years, and of one which has been buried in the earth many centuries &s;ince; and that the &s;ame Power which is able to effect a <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> in the former ca&s;e, cannot be conceived adequate to the like operation in the latter. And indeed it de&s;erves to be remarked, that to maintain, or to intimate this, is at be&s;t to make ex|tremely free with Omnipotence, and in fact only begs a que&s;tion in&s;tead of &s;atisfying it. Be&s;ides, this expedient will appear to be hea|vily encumbered with &s;trange inconveni|ences;
<PB N="217" REF="232">
to &s;peak much le&s;s har&s;hly of it than perhaps in ju&s;tice I &s;hould. When a finite under&s;tanding has laid the line which infi|nite power cannot pa&s;s, it will have a fair claim to our attention; although, even were this done, the number of in&s;tances we meet with in holy writ of the &s;ame identical body's being rai&s;ed from the grave, or re&s;tored to life, which had actually decea&s;ed, will how|ever ju&s;tify our &s;uppo&s;ition, that the bodies of &s;uch as &s;hall die within a rea&s;onable time before the <HI>la&s;t day</HI> &s;hall be rai&s;ed after this <HI>modus</HI> or manner; and agreeably to the com|mon and natural ideas of a <HI>re&s;urrection.</HI> It will be hard indeed if our adver&s;aries will not allow us to take this for granted; and if they will, the &s;ame under&s;tanding which is able to mea&s;ure infinity can readily inform us how, or whether with a body or without one, the bulk of mankind &s;hall appear at the great day of final retribution.</P>
<P>I come now to revelation more clear and explicit; to plain, intelligible Scripture; with re&s;pect to which, it pains one to &s;ee &s;o great a man as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> taking refuge

in the above di&s;tinction, and indeed in the mo&s;t pitiful eva&s;ions. Ob&s;erve then how this ju&s;tly celebrated philo&s;opher expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the pa&s;&s;age following. <Q>In the New Te&s;tament (wherein, I think, are contained all the articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith,) I find our Saviour and his Apo&s;|tles to preach the <HI>re&s;urrection from the dead,</HI> and the <HI>re&s;urrection of the dead</HI> in many places: but I do not remember any place where the <HI>re&s;urrection of the &s;ame body</HI> is &s;o much as mentioned. Nay, which is very remarkable in the ca&s;e, I do not re|member in any place of the New Te&s;ta|ment, (where the general <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> at the la&s;t day is &s;poken of,) any &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ion as the <HI>re&s;urrection of the body,</HI> much le&s;s of the <HI>&s;ame body.</HI> I &s;ay, the general <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> &amp;c. becau&s;e where the <HI>re&s;ur|rection</HI> of &s;ome <HI>particular per&s;ons</HI> pre&s;ently upon our Saviour's re&s;urrection is men|tioned, the words are, <HI>the graves were opened, and many bodies of &s;aints, which &s;lept, aro&s;e, and came out of the graves, after his re&s;urrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many:</HI> of which peculiar way

<P>There is, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, little or no|thing in this pa&s;&s;age but has its an&s;wer in the foregoing con&s;iderations; unle&s;s we &s;hould be kind enough to acknowlege for argument the triumphant &s;neer of that parenthe&s;is, <HI>(wherein, I think, are contained all the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith.)</HI> It might therefore be &s;ufficient to remark, that Mr. L. &s;eems to admit <HI>my&s;teries</HI> as &s;ome people di&s;pen&s;e <HI>alms, viz. grudgingly,</HI> or <HI>of nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> and at the &s;ame time to expre&s;s our obligations to him for his indulgent conce&s;&s;ion, that <HI>bodies</HI> have been rai&s;ed from the dead upon <HI>particular oc|ca&s;ions.</HI> But becau&s;e this great writer may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;till thought by &s;ome to have hit

upon an expedient, which happily helps him out of embara&s;&s;ment, in the &s;tale di&s;tinction between a <HI>particular</HI> and the <HI>general</HI> Re&s;ur|rection, let us &s;ee whether this di&s;tinction will not vani&s;h before the en&s;uing argumentation.</P>
<P>I venture to aver then that the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> of the <HI>body</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is an e&s;pecial earne&s;t, or &s;ure token of the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> of our <HI>bodies</HI> from the dead.

will terminate in the &s;ame point.

<P>Though what has been here offered can, I think, &s;carcely fall &s;hort of bringing convic|tion to a mind open to it, yet it will be greatly corroborated by other pa&s;&s;ages and particulars, and e&s;pecially by the doctrine

<HI>Re&s;urrection of the body,</HI> or of the <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> was an article of faith from the beginning; and its &s;ub&s;equent date as an article of any <HI>Creed</HI> is a circum&s;tance of very inferior con&s;idera|tion.

<P>But let me &s;hew you how unfairly the author of the <HI>Enquiry</HI> deals by <HI>Polycarp.</HI> Of the two places in this <HI>father's</HI> epi&s;tle to the <HI>Philippians</HI> in which mention is made of the <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> the principal, I think, is that I not long &s;ince quoted, and will here lay again before you. <HI>He that rai&s;ed up Chri&s;t from the dead, &s;hall al&s;o rai&s;e up us in like man|ner.</HI> The words <HI>in like manner</HI> are by the no le&s;s faithful than judicious tran&s;lator printed in <HI>Italics,</HI> as not been literally contained, though nece&s;&s;arily implied in the original. This pa&s;&s;age then, like many more parallel ones which I have had occa&s;ion to produce, I mean, from the Scripture it&s;elf, manife&s;tly
<PB N="249" REF="263">
imports the <HI>re&s;urrection of the body;</HI> though &s;hould any per&s;on affect to doubt what the good <HI>father's</HI> meaning may be <HI>here,</HI> they may &s;oon learn what his idea of the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> was, from a part of the prayer he preferred to God in the hour of his martyrdom, according to the account we have of it in the circular epi&s;tle of the Church of <HI>Smyrna.</HI> He <HI>there</HI> makes mention of the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> both of <HI>&s;oul</HI> and <HI>body.</HI> For though the <HI>&s;oul</HI> cannot, properly &s;peaking, be &s;aid to <HI>ri&s;e again,</HI> yet as the &s;oul and body con&s;titute the &s;ame man, as the&s;e con&s;tituent parts are &s;eparated by death, and reunited at the <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> this reunion is not unfitly expre&s;&s;ed by a term that may be truly predicated of one of the con&s;tituent parts.</P>
<P>Dr. S. admits the genuinene&s;s of the above-mentioned narrative; and yet will not &s;uffer us to con&s;ider the <HI>letter</HI> in one place to be an explanation of the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> in the other. There is more of art than hone&s;ty in an at|tempt to &s;lip out of this difficulty by &s;aying, as the <HI>Enquirer</HI> does in the following words,
<PB N="250" REF="264">
that <Q>by the time this letter was wrote, the notion &s;eems to have prevailed among Chri&s;tians, that the <HI>body</HI> was to be rai&s;ed, though it was not yet got into any of their Creeds.</Q> This is a &s;ort of &s;piritual juggle which inverts truth, and di&s;gui&s;es it in the &s;ame in&s;tant: it metamorpho&s;es the real &s;en|timent of <HI>Polycarp</HI> into a whim&s;ical notion which began to gain ground in the Church!</P>
<P>But this matter may be viewed in another light. The force of truth has drawn from our author an involuntary ce&s;&s;ion of his own darling point. For immediately after the &s;entence la&s;t cited from him, he acquaints us, that <Q>&s;oon after the middle of the &s;econd century di&s;putes aro&s;e about the <HI>re&s;urrec|tion;</HI> the <HI>heathens</HI> objecting to the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of it, and the CHRISTIANS endea|vouring to an&s;wer the objections they met with. The enquiry, &s;ays he, was, whe|ther there was to be a <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> of the <HI>&s;oul</HI> alone, or of the whole man con&s;i&s;ting of body and &s;oul? And then a &s;econd que&s;tion was, whether the <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> the <HI>very</HI>
<PB N="251" REF="265">
<HI>fle&s;h</HI> which we now bear about us, was to be rai&s;ed up again? The WRITERS of that time &s;till extant contended for the <HI>re|&s;urrection of the fle&s;h</HI> together with the &s;oul. But there does not appear to be any <HI>Creed</HI> which e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch a doctrine. For whatever PRIVATE PERSONS might ima|gine to be true, was not in&s;tantly to be <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> as an article of faith, nece&s;&s;ary to be believed in order to Bapti&s;m.</Q> And af|terwards he tells us, that <Q>the controver&s;y about the <HI>re&s;urrection of the fle&s;h</HI> did not begin till the middle, or near the end of the &s;econd century. And then as philo|&s;ophers objected to the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> ITSELF, from the common topics, <HI>how could</HI> FLESH <HI>devoured by bea&s;ts or fi&s;hes, and thus become</HI> PARTS <HI>of tho&s;e animals; or perhaps reduced by fire to a&s;hes, or di&s;per&s;t by &s;eas and rivers, be re&s;tored? Athenagoras, Theophilus,</HI> and <HI>Tertullian</HI> undertook a defence of this no|tion; and taught, that it was no ways be|yond the power of Almighty God to re&s;tore to every one the fle&s;h he once had.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry &amp;c. p. 18.</NOTE><HI>(ii)</HI></P>

<HI>"them the fir&s;t time."

per&s;picuity with which the doctrine of the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> is taught and enforced in the <HI>Koran,</HI> is that he conceived it to be &s;uffici|ently reconcileable with the common rea&s;on and apprehen&s;ion of mankind; at the &s;ame time that, from this among other particu|lars, we mu&s;t &s;ee, and mu&s;t de&s;ire its adver|&s;aries to take notice, that it is not a doc|trine peculiar to Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>To come now to the <HI>conclu&s;ion of the whole matter.</HI> If <HI>the&s;e things are &s;o,</HI> if the great doctrines we have been handling are defen&s;ible upon &s;ound principles, and have a mo&s;t firm foundation in Scripture, and in pri|mitive authority, abundant rea&s;on have we to <HI>hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith without wavering;</HI> in nothing di&s;mayed by adver|&s;aries who trifle with us upon the mo&s;t &s;e|rious &s;ubjects; who render the word of God of none effect, by perver&s;e interpretation; who cannot, or will not &s;ee the plain &s;en&s;e of the plaine&s;t expre&s;&s;ions; who will not ac|knowlege <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be the Creator of the world though <HI>all things were made by him;</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="270">
or that he made &s;atisfaction for &s;in, though he was <HI>&s;acrificed for us,</HI> and <HI>gave his life a ran|&s;om for all.</HI> I know not any thing that can equal this &s;tubbornne&s;s and &s;lowne&s;s of heart except the in&s;olence of &s;uch as gravely tell us, we mu&s;t not hope to propagate the Go&s;|pel among <HI>Jews, Mahometans,</HI> or heathens, while the &s;trange doctrines contained in our Creeds are retained in the Church.

And indeed &s;o in|con&s;iderable are the impediments to a &s;piri|tual coalition between the followers of <HI>So|cinus</HI> and the di&s;ciples of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that, ac|cording to information given us by writers of credit, terms of union and amity were ac|tually propo&s;ed by the former to the latter in the la&s;t century. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Jones's Introduc.

<P>The principle of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ional</HI> leads, we apprehend, to the&s;e ab&s;urd con&s;equences; but at the &s;ame time we a&s;&s;ert no <HI>dominion</HI> over the <HI>faith,</HI> or the con&s;ciences of others; we leave every one to <HI>&s;tand or fall to his own ma&s;ter;</HI> we conceive, that, by the immutable con&s;titution of things, every one will think
<PB N="264" REF="278">
and act for him&s;elf, though we imagine all men to be accountable to God as well for their opinions as for their practices; we nei|ther do, nor wi&s;h to <HI>compel</HI> men to <HI>come in</HI> that our Church <HI>may be filled,</HI> per&s;uaded as we are at the &s;ame time that this Church is, in re&s;pect of all e&s;&s;entials, an apo&s;tolical one; that &s;he <HI>holds fa&s;t the things which become &s;ound doctrine,</HI> and teaches the <HI>words of eternal life.</HI></P>
<P>It may with great truth be affirmed, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> a&s;&s;erts the <HI>right of private judgment</HI> in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and to the &s;ame latitude that every party or body of Pro|te&s;tants does. For how does the management of the &s;everal leaders and teachers of the Sectaries accord with this univer&s;ally avowed principle? How do <HI>they</HI> leave men to their own judgments in matters of religion? Do <HI>they</HI> not find ways and means to become ma&s;|ters of the under&s;tandings, and the con&s;ci|ences of their followers; and accompli&s;h that by indirect artifice which they load us with obloquy for doing under the &s;anction of law|ful authority? The fact is, in ca&s;e of &s;upe|riority,
<PB N="265" REF="279">
any &s;ect that you may name would think it&s;elf, not barely empowered, but bound to &s;trengthen and &s;ecure it&s;elf by legal fences and e&s;tabli&s;hments, and by authorita|tive con&s;titutions; i. e. by tho&s;e very means and methods again&s;t which it now &s;o vehe|mently exclaims. Experience will ju&s;tify our &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;uch would be the ca&s;e; as we know the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branch of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to have changed its language, and its &s;entiments, with its &s;ituation. The fir&s;t article of the memorable <HI>&s;olemn League and Covenant</HI> declares the intention of its fra|mers to be, <HI>to</HI> <Q><HI>bring the Churches of God in the three kingdoms to the neare&s;t conjunction and uniformity in religion,</HI> CONFESSION OF FAITH, FORM OF CHURCH-GOVERN|MENT, and DIRECTORY FOR WORSHIP and CATECHISING; <HI>that they and their po&s;terity after them might as brethren live in faith and love.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant enough to ob&s;erve, that, notwith&s;tanding the fine flouri&s;hes and co|lourings of certain authors, who plau&s;ibly
<PB N="266" REF="280">
profe&s;s them&s;elves to be advocates for the common rights and privileges of Chri&s;tians, we find them &s;ometimes driven out of their track by the irre&s;i&s;tible force of truth, and in&s;en&s;ibly advancing&punc; or admitting eccle|&s;ia&s;tical notions: we find them after all their efforts and &s;truggles to climb over the pale of the Church, unwarily, or rather unavoid|ably &s;lipping back, as I may &s;ay, into her fold, and undermining their own principles. The words of a late famous prelate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bp. Hoadley.</NOTE>upon this &s;ubject will verify the ob&s;ervation. <Q>As it is ab&s;urd, &s;ays he, to &s;uppo&s;e that any man can be &s;aved by the faith of another, or by any belief but what is truly his own; &s;o there is no po&s;&s;ible method of having a faith of his own, properly &s;o called, with|out building it entirely upon what appears right to his own judgment, &s;uch as it is, after his be&s;t endeavours for INFORMA|TION.</Q> That is to &s;ay, in other words, a man cannot properly be &s;aid to judge for <HI>him&s;elf</HI> till he has received information, or in&s;truction from <HI>others.</HI> In &s;hort, let privi|leges be as &s;acred, or con&s;ciences as tender
<PB N="267" REF="281">
as you plea&s;e, I affirm that the erection and e&s;tabli&s;hment of a national Church, whether the doctrines &s;he teaches are in them&s;elves orthodox or otherwi&s;e, true or fal&s;e, is as fairly defen&s;ible upon rational and prote&s;tant grounds, as the in&s;titution of any religious &s;ect, or &s;ociety what&s;oever.</P>
<P>True it is that men, inflamed with fal&s;e zeal, or mi&s;led by wrong judgment, may de|part both from prote&s;tant and Chri&s;tian prin|ciples; and at their peril it will be. The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> endeavoured to extirpate what &s;he <HI>called here&s;y</HI> by the very &s;ame means which in early days Pagani&s;m employed for the overthrow of the Chri&s;tian faith it&s;elf. And what was the con&s;equence? The inhu|manity of per&s;ecution afforded to every think|ing mind a very &s;trong argument of the cor|ruption of that Church in which it was countenanced; it frightened men <HI>into</HI> their <HI>Sen&s;es;</HI> it helped to open their under&s;tand|ings; and Popery may upon the matter be &s;aid to have been burnt out of the kingdom. I undertake not to prove, that in our own
<PB N="268" REF="282">
Church zeal has always been &s;ufficiently governed by prudence, or tempered with charity. There is no occa&s;ion to recur to a few di&s;agreeable in&s;tances, or the tran&s;actions of untoward times. But, I tru&s;t, I &s;hall be abun|dantly warranted in a&s;&s;erting, that he who at this day &s;hall charge the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or any con&s;iderable number of her members, with a want of due moderation, <HI>knows not of what manner of Spirit we are of.</HI> And yet, if the author of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ional</HI> is to be cre|dited, we are relap&s;ing gradually into Po|pery, both in our doctrines and our prac|tices. We are given to under&s;tand, in the &s;eventh Chap. of that work, that <Q>Some competent ob&s;ervers have grounds for more than a &s;u&s;picion, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> has been, and &s;till is, though by degrees imperceptible to vulgar eyes, edg|ing back once more towards Popery.</Q> Sure the&s;e <HI>ob&s;ervers</HI> are much more <HI>&s;harp-&s;ighted</HI> than their neighbours! I do not well know what the&s;e Gentlemen are afraid of; but I know true Chri&s;tianity to be mo&s;t in danger from the diametrically oppo&s;ite quarter; not
<PB N="269" REF="283">
&s;o much from men of too great, as from people of too <HI>little faith;</HI> not &s;o much from the triple-mitre of the <HI>Roman</HI> pontiff, as from the many-headed <HI>hydra</HI> of infidelity. The truth of the matter is, the author before us and his friends do not &s;peak out, as our <HI>open enemies</HI> have done, and as them&s;elves were called upon to do, by every maxim of ju&s;tice, candor, and genero&s;ity. They are in no dread of <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>faggot;</HI> they are offend|ed, not by the <HI>di&s;cipline,</HI> but by certain doc|trines of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which we hold in common with her, (even the <HI>doc|trines</HI> I have been defending,) and which they mo&s;t in&s;idiou&s;ly and indu&s;triou&s;ly labour to confound with the ab&s;urdities which are ju&s;tly had in deri&s;ion, or in abhorrence among us, and of which the credit vi&s;ibly dimini&s;hes every day. Errors may be grafted upon the &s;tock of truth; which in it&s;elf is not the le&s;s pure, or the le&s;s amiable, becau&s;e it may be <HI>holden</HI> in folly as well as in <HI>unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> To an ardent longing to &s;ee the&s;e common doctrines expunged from our <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Creeds,</HI> we are unque&s;tionably to a&s;cribe that
<PB N="270" REF="284">
profu&s;ion of &s;pleen, malevolence, and ran|cour with which &s;o many pages, of the <HI>Con|&s;e&s;&s;ional,</HI> and of other treati&s;es are &s;hamefully defiled. But for the&s;e doctrines, I am tho|roughly per&s;uaded, the rea&s;onablene&s;s, and utility, not to &s;ay nece&s;&s;ity of Church-e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, would generally be admitted, and even contended for. That nicety of human wi&s;dom which &s;trains at two or three of our <HI>Articles</HI> could, I am apt to think, well enough dige&s;t the remainder of the <HI>thirty nine.</HI> But as matters are circum&s;tanced, the principle I have been combating is far from being an unpopular one. The privilege, or right of private judgment, in the &s;en&s;e of our adver&s;aries, reduces in &s;ome &s;ort all men to an equality, and is extremely &s;oothing to vain and to weak minds. The fact is, there is no difficulty in declaiming from &s;tanding and &s;pecious topics either of eulogy, or in|vective. An affected zeal for reformation, and an avowed anxiou&s;ne&s;s for the revival of go&s;pel &s;implicity, have a verv ingratiating ten|dency with the bulk of mankind. <HI>Liberty of con&s;cience, Freedom of &s;entiment, (qq) eccle|&s;ia&s;tical</HI>

<P>To conclude. That there is nothing in the lea&s;t exceptionable in our whole eccle|&s;ia&s;tical &s;y&s;tem; nothing that might rea&s;on|ably be retrenched; nothing that could po&s;|&s;ibly be amended even in our <HI>Articles,</HI> as well as wor&s;hip, rites, and u&s;ages, we by no means affirm: but re&s;pectfully leaving <HI>the&s;e things</HI> to the con&s;ideration of them that <HI>are over us in the Lord,</HI> we utterly deny that there is any thing fundamentally wrong, or e&s;&s;entially erroneous in our &s;piritual con&s;titu|tion. <HI>(rr)</HI> Men may be, and we find them to be bigots in the cau&s;e of infidelity; nor

<P>Page 13. <HI>(c) Errors of integrity.]</HI> One of Mr. <HI>K.</HI>'s arguments, or rather one argument urged by him in the name of his Church, is the following. <Q>He|retics would ari&s;e after the Apo&s;tles time, and after the writing of Scriptures: the&s;e cannot be di&s;covered, condemned, and avoided, unle&s;s the Church be infallible; therefore there mu&s;t be a Church infallible.</Q> To which Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> replies in the&s;e words. <Q>I pray tell me why can|not here&s;ies be&s;ufficiently di&s;covered, condemned, and avoided by them which believe Scripture to be the rule of faith? If Scripture be &s;ufficient to inform us what is the faith, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be al&s;o &s;ufficient to teach us what is here&s;y; &s;eeing here&s;y is nothing but a manife&s;t deviation from, and an oppo&s;ition to the faith. That which is &s;traight will plainly teach us what is crooked, and one contrary cannot but manife&s;t the other. If any one &s;hould deny that there is a God, that this God is omnipotent, omni&s;cient, good, &amp;c, &amp;c; that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Saviour of the world, and the Son of God; if any man &s;hould deny either his birth, his pa&s;&s;ion, or re&s;ur|rection, &amp;c; or <HI>&s;itting at the right hand of God;</HI> his having <HI>all power given him,</HI> &amp;c; that it is he whom God hath appointed to be <HI>Judge of the quick and the dead;</HI> that all men &s;hall ri&s;e again at
<PB N="280" REF="293">
the la&s;t day, &amp;c, &amp;c; if a man &s;hould hold, that either the keeping of the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> law is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, or that <HI>good works</HI> are not nece&s;&s;ary; in a word, if any man &s;hould ob&s;tinately contradict the truth of any thing plainly delivered in Scripture, who does not &s;ee that every one which believes the Scripture hath &s;ufficient means to di&s;cover, and condemn, and avoid that here&s;y, without any need of an infallible guide? If you &s;ay, that the <HI>ob&s;cure places of Scripture contain matters of faith,</HI> I an|&s;wer, that it is a matter of faith to believe that the &s;en&s;e of them, whatever it is, which was in|tended by God, is true; for he that doth not &s;o, calls God's truth into que&s;tion. But to believe this or that to be the true &s;en&s;e of them, or to believe the true &s;en&s;e of them, and to avoid the fal&s;e, is not nece&s;&s;ary either to faith, or &s;alvation.</Q></P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, however, whether this gives us &s;atisfaction to the full? Do not our <HI>Creeds</HI> and <HI>Articles</HI> contain particulars which we &s;hall look for in vain in M. <HI>C.</HI>'s li&s;t of the objects of faith? Are not many whom we con&s;ider as heretics ready to &s;ub&s;cribe to this li&s;t? Was Mr. <HI>C.</HI> inadvertently, or de&s;ignedly &s;ilent with regard to the&s;e particulars? Or are we to con&s;ign them to the cla&s;s of ob&s;curity? Whatever might have been his motive to the word|ing of his paragraph in this manner, or whatever was his per&s;onal per&s;ua&s;ion in re&s;pect to the fun|damental articles of the faith profe&s;&s;ed by the

<P>When Mr. <HI>C.,</HI> or any body el&s;e tells us, that <Q>God does not require any more of any man than this, to believe the Scripture to be God's word, and to endeavour to find the true &s;en&s;e of it, and to live according to it;</Q> or, that <Q>he that believes the Scripture &s;incerely, and endeavours to believe it in the true &s;en&s;e, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be an heretic,</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Relig. of Prote&s;t. p. 335; and end of Preface.</NOTE>he mu&s;t be under&s;tood with qualifi|cation; as a&s;&s;erting, not ab&s;olutely that an hone&s;t man cannot po&s;&s;ibly <HI>err concerning the faith,</HI> but that error, or here&s;y will not be imputed to invo|luntary ignorance, or to &s;incerity of per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>Here&s;y, &s;ays Bp. <HI>Taylor,</HI> is not an error of the under&s;tanding, but of the will;</Q> and el&s;ewhere, <Q>it is not the opinion, but the impiety that con|demns and makes the heretic.</Q> On this princi|ple this &s;agacious and moderate writer condemns the <HI>Here&s;iarch</HI> who&s;e error <Q>commences upon pride and ambition, &amp;c. and excu&s;es tho&s;e who follow him in &s;implicity of heart.</Q></P>

<HI>&s;incere of the</HI> Arian <HI>per&s;ua&s;ion.</HI> They are heretics, but do not know that they are &s;o. In &s;hort, they are heretics in our judgment, not &s;o in their own; for they e&s;teem them&s;elves &s;uch good Catholics, that they even throw upon us the infamous charge of here&s;y. Such therefore as they are to us, we are to them. We know a&s;&s;uredly that they are injurious to the divine generation of the Son of God, in making him inferior to the Father. They, on the other hand, think us injurious to the Father, in believing them both equal. How they &s;hall be puni&s;hed at the day of judgment for this their error, &amp;c. no one can know except the Judge.</P>
<P>It may be proper to take Mr. <HI>K.</HI>'s argument, and Mr. <HI>C.</HI>'s an&s;wer into re-con&s;ideration. <Q>Here&s;ies, &s;ays the former, would ari&s;e after the Apo&s;tles' time, and after the writing of Scriptures: the&s;e cannot be di&s;covered, condemned, and avoided, unle&s;s the Church be infallible; therefore there mu&s;t be a Church infallible.</Q> The &s;ub&s;tance of Mr. <HI>C.</HI>'s reply is, that <Q>without any need of an infallible guide,</Q> the great truths of the Go&s;pel are di&s;coverable, and con&s;equently here&s;ies avoid|able, by all &s;uch as <Q>believe Scripture to be the rule of faith:</Q> and that with re&s;pect to tho&s;e ob&s;cure places of Scripture," which Mr. <HI>K.</HI> tells us "contain matters of faith," we have nothing to do but <Q>believe that the &s;en&s;e of them, what&s;oever it is, which was intended by God, is true,</Q> without being &s;olicitous to avoid mi&s;takes concerning them.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="296">
By this an&s;wer 'tis certain this celebrated di&s;pu|tant &s;eems to lay his own faith rather open to &s;u&s;|picion. For does he not admit what he might, and in fact ought to have conte&s;ted? Take them in the gro&s;s, the <Q>places of Scripture which contain matters of faith,</Q> are not by any means <HI>ob&s;cure,</HI> but altogether plain and intelligible. <HI>I &s;peak con|cerning</HI> the faith of <HI>the Church.</HI> What the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e places is, according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of interpretation, and according to the belief of the Chri&s;tians of the fir&s;t ages, is a que&s;tion, to the determination of which we &s;urely need not have recour&s;e to infallibility. Though therefore, with re&s;pect to pa&s;&s;ages really ambiguous, or <HI>ob&s;cure,</HI> it will be a &s;afe and excellent rule, <Q>to believe that the &s;en&s;e of them, what&s;oever it is, which was intended by God, is true,</Q> yet it will be unfair, unrea&s;onable, and un&s;afe to apply this rule to places which are no otherwi&s;e ambiguous, or <HI>ob&s;cure,</HI> than as they "contain matters of faith;" e&s;pecially when we remember how frequently, and how ear|ne&s;tly we are required to <HI>&s;trive for the faith,</HI> to <HI>contend for the faith,</HI> and to <HI>examine</HI> and <HI>prove</HI> our <HI>own</HI> &s;elves <HI>whether</HI> we <HI>be in the faith.</HI> Truth is not le&s;s truth becau&s;e it is held in a Church that pre|tends not to be infallible.

<P>Page 14. <HI>(d) of in&s;anity.]</HI> I cannot bring my&s;elf to recall the&s;e words by the high re&s;pect which on many accounts is due to the names of certain per&s;ons, eminent for their ability, and &s;ome of them for their piety too, who have advanced notions not a whit le&s;s eccentric or extravagant than the&s;e. The late worthy Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cloyne,</HI> who denied, or at lea&s;t doubted the exi&s;tence of matter, is not without his numerous admirers. In fact, he &s;eems to have confounded all, though he has con|vinced none. But whatever purpo&s;e was intended to be &s;erved by &s;uch a doctrine, &s;urely its real con|&s;equences mu&s;t be detrimental to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity. If all about us is mere mockery and illu&s;ion, the very foundations of all evidence, all faith, and all practice are undermined; nor will it be po&s;&s;ible to determine which po&s;ition mo&s;t con|tradicts my &s;en&s;es, or offers mo&s;t violence to my conceptions, <HI>that</HI> which avers the non-exi&s;tence of matter, or <HI>that</HI> which maintains the <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiation</HI> of it in the holy Sacrament. The followers of Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> will be apt to laugh this notion to &s;corn,
<PB N="285" REF="298">
under a per&s;ua&s;ion that they deny, or doubt the ex|i&s;tence of Spirit, and con&s;equently of God, with a much better grace. It may be ob&s;erved, with re|gard to both extremes, that there is no &s;uch thing as demon&s;trating beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, or contradiction. For, to u&s;e the words of an author of the la&s;t century, <Q>it is po&s;&s;ible that <HI>mathematical evidence</HI> it&s;elf may be but a con&s;tant undi&s;covera|ble delu&s;ion, which our nature is nece&s;&s;arily and perpetually obnoxious unto, and that either fatally or fortuitou&s;ly there has been in the world time out of mind &s;uch a being as we call <HI>Man,</HI> who&s;e e&s;&s;ential property it is to be then mo&s;t of all mi&s;taken when he conceives a thing mo&s;t evidently true.</Q> There is no &s;hutting the door again&s;t &s;ceptici&s;m. We meet with doubters and di&s;puters of all ages and nations. <HI>Marcus Antoni|nus</HI> makes mention of one <HI>Monimus,</HI> a <HI>Cynic</HI> philo|&s;opher, who averred that all is fancy, and that there is ab&s;olutely no &s;uch thing as a <HI>criterion</HI> of truth. <HI>Pyrrho,</HI> though not the fir&s;t &s;ceptic, was famous enough to give an appellation to &s;ceptici&s;m. But notwith&s;tanding all this, a man of &s;en&s;e and of common prudence will li&s;ten to rational evidence, and yield a&s;&s;ent to moral certainty. He will &s;oon be convinced upon enquiry, that both body and &s;pirit exi&s;t, and that mind is neither matter nor motion; that if chance, or nature, if you plea&s;e, made the world, it is that which pre&s;erves it too;

and may di&s;&s;olve it; and, after its di&s;&s;olution, may re&s;tore it to its original &s;tate, or reduce it to one infinitely wor&s;e than the pre&s;ent. This &s;ure is at be&s;t but uncomfortable philo&s;ophy. Not that I would hereby in&s;inuate immorality to be nece&s;&s;arily con|nected with infidelity. <HI>Plato</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed long ago between the "ranting" and &s;ober athei&s;t; and ob|&s;erved, that a man who&s;e &s;entiments are impious may be virtuous from con&s;titution. Accordingly he very ju&s;tly re&s;olves athei&s;m into not barely depravi|ty of manners, but &s;ometimes into an affectation of &s;ingular wi&s;dom. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letters on Infidelity. p. 35.</NOTE>One &s;ource of athei&s;m in his opinion is, <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is almo&s;t literally tran&s;lated in the fol|lowing words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e, they became fools.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> &s;eems unwarily to give &s;ome ad|vantage to the athei&s;t, where he &s;ays, that <Q>when we affirm that God is incomprehen&s;ible, we only mean, that our imperfect minds cannot have &s;uch a conception of his nature as doth perfectly ma&s;ter, conquer, and &s;ubdue that va&s;t object under it, &amp;c.</Q> The ca&s;e is, we comprehend by our rea&s;on <HI>that</HI> God is, though not <HI>what</HI> he is, in re&s;pect of his e&s;&s;ence in the ab&s;tract. But that he is &s;elf-exi&s;tent from all eternity, that he is a <HI>Spirit,</HI> that he is the Creator and Governor of the Uni|ver&s;e, that he is all perfect, are certain truths,

notwith&s;tanding the darkne&s;s which &s;urrounds them. <HI>Sophocles</HI> may be imagined to have had the&s;e truths in his eye, when &s;peaking of the divine edicts, and the immutable decrees of heaven, he puts this fine &s;entiment in the mouth of <HI>Antigone,</HI>

<P>To avoid making God the author of evil, the doctrine of <HI>Zoroa&s;tres</HI> was, that <Q>God originally and directly created only light, or good; and that darkne&s;s, or evil, followed it by con&s;equence, as the &s;hadow doth the per&s;on; that light, or good, hath only a real production from God, and the other afterward re&s;ulted from it, as the defect thereof.</Q> An ingenious writer gives us the &s;entiments of <HI>Plato</HI> on this perplexing &s;ub|ject, in the following tran&s;lation. <Q>God is good.

Dr. <HI>Fiddes</HI> gives us a pa&s;&s;age from St. <HI>Hilary,</HI> in which that Father a&s;&s;erts, that <Q>our making the Son God is no objection again&s;t the Father's being the one God. He is the one God, &s;ays he, becau&s;e the only underived God.</Q> Surely Bp. <HI>Pear&s;on</HI> him|&s;elf, who in the main is wonderfully exact, does not &s;peak in the mo&s;t proper terms, when he tells us, that <Q>the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is originally God, as not receiving his eternal being from any other; that therefore it nece&s;&s;a|rily followeth, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is certain|ly not the Father, cannot be a Per&s;on &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the Divine Nature originally of him&s;elf; and con&s;equently, it having been already proved, that he is truly and properly the eternal God, that he mu&s;t be under&s;tood to have the Godhead communicated to him by the Father, who is not only eternally but originally God; that in him (Chri&s;t) is the &s;ame fulne&s;s of the Godhead, more than which the Father cannot have, but yet that in that perfect and ab&s;olute equality there is notwith&s;tanding this di&s;parity, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> To adduce only one example more; even the judi|cious <HI>Hooker</HI> is off his guard in the following pa&s;|&s;age. <Q>Seeing therefore the Father alone is origi|nally that Deity which Chri&s;t originally is not, (for Chri&s;t is God by being of God, light
<PB N="302" REF="315">
by i&s;&s;uing out of light,) it followeth hereupon, that what&s;oever Chri&s;t hath common unto him with his heavenly Father, the &s;ame of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be given him, but naturally and eternally given him, not be&s;towed by way of benevolence &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The priority implied in the term Father, in its common acceptation, accounts for all this incoherency; but where, I would gladly know, do the terms <HI>auctor, fons, origo, principium,</HI> &amp;c. occur in the Scriptures, or in the writings of the apo&s;tolical Fathers, <HI>Clemens, Polycarp,</HI> and <HI>Ig|natius?</HI> Or where are any terms to be found importing &s;ubordination and inferiority, except &s;uch as evidently refer to the humanity of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI> And after all, and all this put together notwith&s;tanding, the common re&s;emblances by which the great my&s;tery has been faintly illu&s;trated by the Fathers, e&s;pecially by <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr, Ter|tullian,</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI> as light from the &s;un, or a &s;tream from a fountain, are produced to no pur|po&s;e as proofs of a &s;ubordination, &amp;c. For let light be &s;uppo&s;ed to have i&s;&s;ued from the &s;un, or a &s;tream from a fountain, from all eternity; on this &s;uppo&s;ition it is plain, cau&s;ality and originality are merely nominal; the fountain nece&s;&s;arily im|plies the &s;tream, and the &s;un, light: and in like manner, in the ca&s;e before us, the exi&s;tence of the Father nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es the exi&s;tence of the Son,
<PB N="303" REF="316">
and of the Holy Gho&s;t. The Father can no more exi&s;t without the Son than the Son without the Father.</P>
<P>The truth is, the Fathers of the Church, who&s;e &s;entiments Bp. <HI>Bull</HI> lays before us, apparently grant much, but really yield nothing. If <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> e. g., a&s;&s;erting the eternity and Divinity of the Son of God, meant not &s;uch an ab&s;olute co-equality as en|tirely excludes all dependence and inferiority, he flatly contradicts the Creed which goes under his name, in which it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, that in the Trinity, <Q>none is afore or after other, none is greater or le&s;s than another;</Q> and if he did mean this, we cannot argue again&s;t his faith from the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or the impropriety, or even the ab&s;urdity of his expre&s;&s;ions. Elucidation has before now been the parent of entanglement. The <HI>Arians</HI> them&s;elves are &s;en&s;ible they cannot admit the eter|nity of the Son of God, without acknowleging at the &s;ame time his ab&s;olute co-equality; and therefore affect to under&s;tand every pa&s;&s;age or phra&s;e &s;eemingly derogating from the dignity of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as a direct a&s;&s;ertion, or tacit conce&s;&s;ion that he is a creature. Through a mo&s;t &s;trange in|advertence, the writers we have been extracting from appear to have confounded the idea of tempo|ral with that of eternal generation.</P>
<P>It has been frequently and well ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of the Fathers, before the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI>
<PB N="304" REF="317">
&s;peak &s;ometimes of a temporal generation of the Son by the operation of the Holy Gho&s;t on the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; and &s;ometimes, by a &s;ort of <HI>cata|chre&s;is,</HI> give the name of generation to the mi&s;&s;ion of the Son from the Father, for the purpo&s;e of creating the world; and that, by directing our whole attention to the pa&s;&s;ages relative to both the&s;e, the enemies of our faith have artfully attempted to prevent our notice, or acknowlegment of other numberle&s;s places in the writings of the&s;e Fathers, wherein they plainly and unequivocally a&s;&s;ert the eternal generation of the Son of God.</P>
<P>By help of the&s;e con&s;iderations, and &s;uch as the&s;e, we &s;hall, for the mo&s;t part, be enabled to reconcile exceptionable pa&s;&s;ages in the writings of the Fa|thers in general with the pure&s;t faith, and &s;tricte&s;t orthodoxy; and &s;hall have no cau&s;e for re&s;entment, or complaint, if in &s;o large a bulk of human com|po&s;ition, and amid&s;t &s;uch a multiplicity of &s;ubjects and circum&s;tances, we are &s;ometimes &s;urprized by inaccurate diction, or un&s;ound &s;entiment.</P>

<PB N="305" REF="318">
Creator; <HI>viz. ante mundum conditum.</HI> Nay, there is an expre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Lactantius</HI> which more than in&s;i|nuates that there was a time, when even God the Father, or God ab&s;olutely con&s;idered, was not; for, &s;ays he, <HI>Deus ip&s;e &s;e fecit.</HI> And, by the way, they who talk of God the Father's <Q>RECEIVING <HI>his Being from him&s;elf alone,</HI></Q> do but paraphra&s;e the words of <HI>Lactantius.</HI> I cannot think the Ca|tholic faith can be in the lea&s;t affected by the&s;e <HI>early opinions</HI> concerning <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtleties, technical terms, and un|&s;criptural definitions and di&s;tinctions have undoubt|edly done no &s;mall di&s;&s;ervice to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;ti|anity. But, as Dr. <HI>Waterland</HI> repeatedly ob&s;erves, let the blame be laid at the right door. The&s;e things were artfully and gradually introduced into the Church by heretics, for the purpo&s;e of confounding and perplexing matters.

<P>I would take this opportunity to ob&s;erve, that the doctrine of types and &s;ymbols, as it has been revived by many moderns, &s;o has it by &s;ome been upheld with a zeal which, in going beyond the bounds of judgment, has, it may be, done di&s;&s;er|vice to Chri&s;tianity.

In &s;hort, the doctrine of types in gene|ral is, in my opinion, too often at be&s;t more inge|nious than &s;olid, and has a &s;tronger foundation in fancy than in fact. Perhaps the reader may be en|tertained as well as convinced by two or three &s;e|lect in&s;tances.

<P>Dr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> in re&s;entment, I pre&s;ume, of that explicitne&s;s with which <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> in the place referred to, and in many other, a&s;&s;erts the doctrine of the Trinity, and with a view to counteract it, takes much pains to repre&s;ent his interpretation of Scripture as frequently ab&s;urd, and his doctrine as neither more nor le&s;s than refined <HI>Platoni&s;m.</HI> But

the unfairne&s;s, or rather the fal&s;ity of both impu|tations has often been &s;hewn.

<P>Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> in his treati&s;e entitled, <HI>An Endea|vour to evince the certainty of Chri&s;tian faith,</HI> &amp;c, cites hi&s;torians of credit, who acquaint us, that when <HI>Julian</HI>'s de&s;ign of fal&s;ifying the predictions of our Saviour, by rebuilding the Temple of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> was defeated by miraculous eruptions of balls of fire, &amp;c, (as the &s;tory is told by <HI>Ammianus Mar|cellinus,</HI> and many others,) almo&s;t all the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were eye-witne&s;&s;es of this wonderful &s;cene, were converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, and acknowleged Chri&s;t to be God.

<P>It &s;eems evident enough from the&s;e words, that the <HI>Jews</HI> who were converted on this occa&s;ion, and con&s;equently Chri&s;tians in general, at that time acknowledged Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be ab&s;olutely God.</P>

<P>Let us hear now what a much better known, and an univer&s;ally admired author has to offer upon the &s;ame argument. From the three divine attri|butes of infinite Goodne&s;s, Wi&s;dom, and Power, the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> and <HI>Platoni&s;ts</HI> &s;eem to have framed their <HI>Trinity</HI> of what Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> calls <HI>Archichal Hypo&s;ta&s;es:</HI> to which he &s;uppo&s;es <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> may be thought to allude in the following pa&s;&s;age in his book <HI>de caelo.</HI> l. 1. c. 1. <GAP DESC="foreign"> (the Py|thagoreans) <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>In another place, this learned author gives us to under&s;tand, that <HI>Zoroa&s;tres,</HI> and the ancient <HI>Magi</HI> acknowleged the Supreme Deity under the different
<PB N="334" REF="347">
names of <HI>Mithras</HI> and <HI>Oroma&s;ius;</HI> which <HI>Mithras</HI> was commonly called <GAP DESC="foreign"> or three-fold. This, it &s;eems, <HI>J. Vo&s;&s;ius</HI> would refer to the three <HI>hypo&s;|ta&s;es</HI> in the Deity, agreeably to the Chri&s;tian theo|ry: but <HI>Cudworth</HI> thinks it to be more conform|able to the <HI>Pythagoric</HI> or <HI>Platonic</HI> hypothe&s;is of three di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tances &s;ubordinate to each other. This writer ob&s;erves el&s;ewhere, that <HI>Pagan</HI> theo|logy in general maintained a <HI>Trinity</HI> of univer&s;al principles, or Divine <HI>hypo&s;ta&s;es</HI> &s;ubordinate; the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <GAP DESC="foreign"> EN called <GAP DESC="foreign">; and <GAP DESC="foreign"> or intellect, <GAP DESC="foreign">, the &s;econd God; and the mun|dane Soul, or animated world, <GAP DESC="foreign">, the third God. According to the &s;ame author, the <HI>Crocodile</HI> was a &s;ymbol of the fir&s;t God of the Aegyp|tians; <Q>an animal which when in the water &s;ees without being &s;een:</Q> and among the &s;ame people <HI>a winged globe with a &s;erpent &s;pringing out of it,</HI> was the <HI>Hieroglyphic</HI> of a triform Deity, or Trinity of Divine <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;es.</HI> By the globe was &s;ignified the fir&s;t incomprehen&s;ible Deity, without beginning or end, &s;elf-exi&s;tent, &amp;c; by the <HI>Serpent,</HI> the Divine wi&s;dom and creative vir|tue; and by the <HI>wings,</HI> that active Spirit which quickens, enlivens, and cheri&s;hes all things.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee now what was the theology of <HI>Julian,</HI> and the latter <HI>Platoni&s;ts.</HI> This famous Apo&s;tate main|tained, that the inferior Gods were mini&s;ters of a &s;upreme God. He a&s;&s;erted, that this Supreme God, or fir&s;t Deity, and fountain of all things, produced
<PB N="335" REF="348">
from him&s;elf, an eternal mind, and a corporeal, or "&s;en&s;ible animated Sun," as a great God in the vi&s;ible world. The latter <HI>Platoni&s;ts,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;tianity, held, that before the Trinity there was another &s;upreme and highe&s;t <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is,</HI> exi&s;t|ing and remaining in the <HI>&s;olitude of his own unity,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> literally tran&s;lates the words of <HI>Jamblicus.</HI> This mu&s;t at lea&s;t be allowed to be language &s;omewhat more intelligible than that of tho&s;e old <HI>Platoni&s;ts</HI> who taught, that there is a &s;ub&s;tance, a principle "in the order of nature &s;u|perior to intellect." They &s;uppo&s;e this fir&s;t and highe&s;t principle of all, to be, by rea&s;on of its ab&s;olute and tran&s;cendent perfection, not only above under&s;tanding, knowlege, and rea&s;on, but above e&s;&s;ence it&s;elf; which, by the way, was the here&s;y of <HI>A. Joachim,</HI> condemned by the fourth <HI>Lateran</HI> Council. Our Author very ju&s;tly calls this vi&s;ionary doctrine <HI>my&s;terious Athei&s;m;</HI> and it &s;eems to have been adopted by that fanta&s;tic heretic <HI>Va|lentinus,</HI> who&s;e thirty Gods, or <HI>Aeons,</HI> were the pro|duction or offspring of a &s;elf-originated Deity, whom he calls <HI>Bythus,</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign">, i. e. unfathomable <HI>profundity;</HI> or, according to &s;ome, of <HI>profundity</HI> and <HI>&s;ilence.</HI> Even the theory of <HI>He&s;iod,</HI> whether li|terally, or phy&s;iologically under&s;tood, is much more agreeable to truth, and the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> hi&s;tory.

<P>At be&s;t, little &s;olid or con&s;i&s;tent can be extracted from this medley of principles; and if we under|&s;tand by <HI>a Trinity,</HI> what in rea&s;on we ought to un|der&s;tand by it, <HI>viz. a Trinity of three efficient, living, intelligent Per&s;ons, the &s;overeign cau&s;es and rulers of all things,</HI> (to u&s;e the words of a learned <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Extract from an anonymous Author quoted by Dr. RANDOLPH in his Vindica. p. 51. &amp;c.</NOTE>writer,) we &s;hall look in vain for &s;uch a doctrine properly and preci&s;ely taught before the epoch of Chri&s;ti|anity.

<P><Q>The very fir&s;t thing, &s;ays he, that is taught in all the Bible <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gene&s;is 1. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>is this very my&s;tery.</Q> God <HI>created;</HI> God, i. e. the Word <HI>&s;aid;</HI> and the Spirit, i. e. the Holy Gho&s;t <HI>moved.</HI> <Q>So <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> al&s;o when he is to teach concerning the creation of man, he fir&s;t teacheth that it was the Trinity that created him. <HI>And God &s;aid, Let us make man after our image.</HI> He &s;aith <HI>Let us,</HI> to &s;hew the Trinity of Per&s;ons; and he &s;aith <HI>in our image,</HI> not <HI>in our images,</HI> to &s;hew the unity of e&s;&s;ence.</Q> The Tri|nity is &s;uppo&s;ed by Dr. L. to be declared in many places; even at v. 4. of Deut. 6. <HI>Hear, O I&s;rael, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one.</HI> Dr. L. gives

A &s;en&s;ible writer endeavours to prove, that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the <HI>Law,</HI> and that it is in fact acknowleged and a&s;&s;erted by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rabbies, by <HI>Philo</HI> and <HI>Mai|monides,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Jewi&s;h Cabali&s;ts,</HI> &s;ays he, <Q>di&s;|tingui&s;h God into three Lights; and &s;ome of them call them by the &s;ame names, as the Chri&s;tians, of the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and yet &s;ay that this does not at all break the Unity of God. Your famous <HI>Philo,</HI> &s;ays he, ex|pre&s;&s;es the &s;ame in many places.</Q> And he produ|ces a con&s;iderable number of in&s;tances, by which it appears that this celebrated Rabbin at lea&s;t lays
<PB N="339" REF="352">
him&s;elf open to the attacks of every Chri&s;tian adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame effect Dr. <HI>Randolph</HI> quotes a re|markable pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> in which it is ob|&s;erved, that, according to the doctrine of the <HI>Jews,</HI> <Q>there is, after the E&s;&s;ence of God, &amp;c, a prin|ciple begotten of no other but the Father, being fir&s;t-begotten, &amp;c, being the image of God, the power of God, the wi&s;dom of God, and the word of God; the true light, the <HI>Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>There are two &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages, the one in the book of</HI> Proverbs, <HI>and the other in the</HI> apocryphal <HI>book entitled the</HI> Wi&s;dom of Solomon, <HI>which have been pretty generally con&s;idered as de&s;ignative of the Second Per&s;on in the Chri&s;tian Trinity.</HI> I was &s;et up from everla&s;ting, or ever the earth was. When he prepared the heavens, I was there; when he ap|pointed the foundations of the earth, then was I by him, as one brought up with him, &amp;c. <HI>(Prov. 8. v. 22.</HI> &amp;c.) When all things were in quiet &s;ilence, thine Almighty Word leapt down from heaven out of thy royal throne, &amp;c, &amp;c. <HI>(Wi&s;d. 18. v. 15.</HI> &amp;c.)</P>
<P>The anonymous Author of the te&s;taments of the twelve Patriarchs, (who, as Dr. <HI>Grabe</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, wrote at the latter end of the &s;econd century,) makes every one of them foretell the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, and mo&s;t of them, in the plaine&s;t terms, the incarnation of the Son of God, or ra|ther &s;imply of God.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="353">
All this put together, intricate or incoherent as it may appear, will be thought mo&s;t clearly to im|port a Trinity of &s;ome kind in the Godhead; and we may accordingly di&s;cern in a moment wherein lies the preci&s;e difference between the <HI>Pagan,</HI> the <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Arian,</HI> and the true Chri&s;tian theory. By the hypothe&s;is of each of the three former, the Supreme God neither is nor can be more than One Per&s;on; by that of the latter, the Deity con&s;i&s;ts of three Per&s;ons and one undivided e&s;&s;ence. This as manife&s;tly re&s;i&s;ts the idea of dependence and infe|riority, as the other is compatible with it, or ra|ther, under the notion of a Trinity, &s;uppo&s;es it. In &s;hort, it will, I pre&s;ume, be no ea&s;y matter to &s;ay what objection of weight <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Gentiles, Pythagoreans,</HI> and <HI>Platoni&s;ts,</HI> could have made to the Go&s;pel, what ob&s;tacle there was to their <HI>be|coming obedient to the faith without delay,</HI> except that the univer&s;ally adopted principle of SUBORDINA|TION was &s;uper&s;eded, and effectually de&s;troyed by the peculiarly Chri&s;tian doctrine of EQUALITY.</P>
<P>Perhaps I &s;hall be thought to take upon me here the character of Moderator in the di&s;pute be|tween Mr. <HI>Parkhur&s;t</HI> and Dr. <HI>Prie&s;tly.</HI> I had no &s;uch intention. But if what has been offered does not exactly coincide with the notions of the for|mer, it will at lea&s;t in the re&s;ult be &s;ubver&s;ive of the principles of the latter. The Chri&s;tian doctrine of an equal Trinity will be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the ac|knowlegement
<PB N="341" REF="354">
of a plurality of any kind, re&s;pecting the Godhead, by <HI>Jews,</HI> antient, or modern, or both. With regard to the notions of <HI>Philo,</HI> &amp;c, &s;ee Howes<HI>'s Remarks in Vindication of the antient Fa|thers</HI> &amp;c. p. 41, 42, and &s;eq.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen</HI> gloried in the title of <HI>Unita|rians</HI> upon every occa&s;ion.

<P>We learn from the anonymous author of <HI>Four Treati&s;es,</HI> &amp;c, (who a&s;&s;ures us he derives his au|thorities from writers of the fir&s;t cla&s;s,) that the <HI>Mahometans</HI> carry this <HI>unitarian</HI> principle with them

literally to their graves. His account of their fu|neral &s;olemnities is entertaining enough; but the following are the only particulars with which we are at all concerned.

<P>The corruption of human rea&s;on, and the igno|rance and error incident to our under&s;tandings, <Q>has, &s;ays a mo&s;t excellent author, given manifold occa&s;ion for the benign interpo&s;ition of Divine Providence, which in compa&s;&s;ion to the frailty, the imperfection, and the blindne&s;s of human rea&s;on, hath been plea&s;ed at &s;undry times, and in divers manners, to di&s;cover and enforce its laws by an immediate and direct Revelation. The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or Divine law, and they are to be found only in the
<PB N="347" REF="360">
Scriptures. The&s;e precepts when revealed are found upon compari&s;on to be really a part of the original law of nature, as they tend in all their con&s;equences to man's felicity. But we are not from hence to conclude, that the knowlege of the&s;e truths was attainable by rea&s;on in its pre&s;ent corrupted &s;tate; &s;ince we find that, until they were revealed, they were hid from the wi&s;|dom of ages. As then the moral precepts of this law are indeed of the &s;ame original with tho&s;e of the law of nature, &s;o their intrin&s;ic ob|ligation is of equal &s;trength and perpetuity. Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is of infinitely more authenticity than that moral &s;y&s;tem which is framed by ethical writers, and denominated the natural law. Becau&s;e one is the law of na|ture, expre&s;sly declared &s;o to be by God him|&s;elf; the other is only what, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of human rea&s;on, we imagine to be that law. If we could be as certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an equal authority; but till then they can never be put in any com|petition. Municipal law is a rule of civil con|duct. This di&s;tingui&s;hes municipal law from the natural, or revealed; the former of which is the rule of moral conduct, and the latter not only the rule of moral conduct, but al&s;o the rule of faith.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Commen. on the Laws of England.

<Q>It is allowed on all hands, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> that the <HI>world</HI> was reconciled by Chri&s;t Je&s;us to the <HI>one, only, great and &s;upreme God.</HI> But, this very <HI>&s;ame God</HI> (for the word is but once u&s;ed in the whole &s;entence) was <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t; manife&s;t <HI>in</HI> the fle&s;h, and <HI>reconciling the world to him&s;elf.</HI> And were there no other pa&s;&s;age of Scripture to be found, this alone is &s;ufficient to overthrow the whole doctrine of <HI>Ariani&s;m;</HI> which, as far as the Scripture is concerned, depends upon this one a&s;|&s;ertion, that <HI>the word</HI> GOD, <HI>in Scripture,</HI> NEVER <HI>&s;ignifies a complex notion of more per&s;ons than one; but</HI> ALWAYS <HI>means one per&s;on only, viz. either the per&s;on of the Father &s;ingly, or the per&s;on of the Son &s;ingly.</HI> Which is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e: for here it &s;ig|nifies <HI>both.</HI> The text con&s;iders God as agent and patient at the &s;ame time, and upon the &s;ame oc|ca&s;ion; as the <HI>reconciler</HI> of the world, in the <HI>per|&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Son;</HI> and the object to whom the <HI>re|conciliation was made,</HI> in the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Father;</HI> yet there is but one word (GOD) to expre&s;s them

both. So that the word God, though of the <HI>&s;ingular</HI> number, is of a <HI>plural</HI> comprehen&s;ion.

It is true, they will &s;ay, <HI>God was in Chri&s;t;</HI> but in what &s;en&s;e? why, by his grace, his influence, and &s;piritual commu|nications; as he is likewi&s;e &s;aid to be <HI>in</HI> us; and as Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be <HI>in</HI> us; and as we are &s;aid to
<PB N="358" REF="371">
be <HI>in</HI> God, and to be <HI>in</HI> Chri&s;t, by the purity of our hearts and affections. This, they will tell us, is plain &s;imple theory, without any wanton refine|ment, or imaginary di&s;tinction of "agent and pa|tient, &amp;c." And with regard to the authorities of <HI>Irenaeus, Origen,</HI> and the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> in the Com|munion &s;ervice, they will add, that they cannot admit either a private &s;entiment, or a public doc|trine to be the &s;tandard of true Chi&s;tianity.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t then let it be ob&s;erved, that though the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> word <HI>God</HI> be "of the <HI>&s;ingular</HI> number," yet the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>Elohim,</HI> of which it is the tran&s;lation, is confe&s;&s;edly "of a <HI>plural</HI> compre|hen&s;ion." Accordingly it has been demon&s;trated over and over again, that the ancient <HI>Jews</HI> held a plurality of &s;ome kind in the Deity. <HI>(Vid. Supr.)</HI></P>
<P>But, &s;econdly, we may recur to con&s;iderations &s;till more internal, and indi&s;putable. If it has been abundantly made to appear, that the Son is God, and the Holy Gho&s;t is God, as properly and truly as the Father is God, the term God mu&s;t unavoid|ably be acknowleged to include, or to "&s;ignify a complex notion of <HI>more per&s;ons than one,"</HI> in many places of holy writ. It will &s;uffice to pro|duce

a few in&s;tances. The Father is &s;aid to be <HI>in</HI> us, 1 John. 4. 13. or to <HI>dwell in</HI> us, or <HI>abide</HI> with us, and the Son is &s;aid to be <HI>in us,</HI> &amp;c, Rom. 8. v. 10. and the Holy Gho&s;t is &s;aid to be <HI>in</HI> us; and, in a ca&s;e which he mentions, St. Paul tells the <HI>Co|rinthians,</HI> it would be reported, that <HI>God</HI> was <HI>in them of a truth.</HI> 1 Cor. 14. 25.

Of the&s;e, the under&s;tanding is the <HI>Father</HI> faculty, and gives being to things, as to us; for what we know not, is to us as if it were not: this an&s;wers to creation.

<P>We have already exhibited to the reader many &s;trange Pagan notions relative to the nature, &amp;c, of the Deity; but perhaps the mo&s;t extraordinary, the mo&s;t eccentric of them all, has not yet been remembered.

The heathen my&s;tical theologi&s;ts often call God <GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;<HI>male</HI> and <HI>female,</HI> &s;ignifying thereby, though gro&s;sly, yet not unemphatically, the <HI>creative</HI> power of the Supreme Being.

<L>Progenitor genitrixque De&ucirc;m; Deus unus et omnis.</L></Q></P>
<P>Methinks this &s;entiment becomes the heathen theologi&s;t, or poet, much better than the Chri&s;tian Divine.</P>
<P>Far from meaning to rank a late very eminent writer, Dr. <HI>I. Watts,</HI> in the number of notorious heretics, or in the lea&s;t to detract from the excel|lence of his character, I think my&s;elf bound in duty to my &s;ubject to take notice here of the &s;in|gularity of his &s;entiments. <Q>His idea of the Di|vinity of Chri&s;t was, that <HI>the Godhead, the Deity it&s;elf, per&s;onally di&s;tingui&s;hed as the</HI> FATHER, <HI>was united to the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in con&s;equence of which union, or indwelling of the Godhead, he be|came properly God.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems the&s;e were likewi&s;e Dr. DODDERIDGE'S &s;enti|ments.</NOTE>He conceived this union to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted before the Saviour's appearance in the fle&s;h, and that <HI>the human &s;oul of Chri&s;t ex|i&s;ted with the Father from before the foundation of the world;</HI> on which ground he maintains the real de&s;cent of Chri&s;t from heaven to earth, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;entiments there is not &s;o much as a re|ference to the Holy Gho&s;t. But we are not to con&s;ider them as final. We &s;hall find the Dr. to have had more enlarged notions re&s;pecting the doc|trine of the Trinity.</P>

<P><Q>Ha&s;t thou not, O Lord God Almighty, ha&s;t thou not tran&s;acted thy divine and important af|fairs among men by thy Son <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and by thy holy Spirit? And ha&s;t thou not ordained that men &s;hould tran&s;act their highe&s;t and mo&s;t momentous concerns with thee, by thy Son, and and by thy Spirit? Ha&s;t thou not, by the mouth of thy Son <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> required all that profe&s;s his religion to be wa&s;hed with water in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t? Is it not my duty then to enquire, who or what are the&s;e &s;acred names,</Q> and what they &s;ignify?</P>
<P><Q>Ha&s;t thou not a&s;cribed divine names, and titles, and characters to thy Son and thy holy Spirit in thy word, as well as a&s;&s;umed them to thy&s;elf? And ha&s;t thou not appointed to them &s;uch glorious offices as cannot be executed with|out &s;omething of divinity or true Godhead in them? And yet art not thou, and thou alone the true God? How &s;hall a poor weak creature be able to adju&s;t and reconcile the&s;e cla&s;hing ideas, and to under&s;tand this my&s;tery? Or mu&s;t I be|lieve and act blindfold,</Q> without under&s;tanding?</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="392">
<Q>Holy Father, (he proceeds,) thou knowe&s;t, how firmly I believe with all my &s;oul, what&s;o|ever thou ha&s;t plainly written and revealed in thy word. I believe Thee to be the only true God, the &s;upreme of beings, &s;elf-&s;ufficient for thine own exi&s;tence, and for all thy infinite af|fairs and tran&s;actions among creatures. I believe thy only Son <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be all-&s;ufficient for the glorious work of mediation between God and man, to which thou ha&s;t appointed him. I believe he is a man, in whom dwells all the ful|ne&s;s of the Godhead bodily. I believe he is one with God; he is God manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h; and that the man <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is &s;o clo&s;ely and in&s;epa|rably united with the true and eternal Godhead, as to become one per&s;on, even as the &s;oul and body make one man.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I believe al&s;o thy ble&s;&s;ed Spirit hath almighty power and influence to do all thy will, to in&s;truct men effectually in divine truths, &amp;c. I yield up my&s;elf joyfully and thankfully to this method of thy &s;alvation, as it is revealed in thy go&s;pel. But I acknowlege my darkne&s;s &s;till. I want to have this wonderful doctrine of the all-&s;ufficience of thy Son and Spirit for the&s;e divine works made a little plainer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Had&s;t thou informed me, gracious Father, in any place of thy word, that this divine doctrine is not to be under&s;tood by men, and yet they
<PB N="380" REF="393">
were required to believe it, I would have &s;ub|dued all my curio&s;ity to faith, &amp;c. But I can|not find thou ha&s;t any where forbid me to under|&s;tand it, or to make the&s;e enquiries. My con|&s;cience is the be&s;t natural light thou ha&s;t put within me, and &s;ince thou ha&s;t given me the Scriptures, my own con&s;cience bids me &s;earch the Scriptures to find out truth, &amp;c. I have, there|fore, been long &s;earching into this divine doc|trine, that I may pay thee due honour with un|der&s;tanding. Surely I ought to know the God whom I wor&s;hip, whether he be one pure and &s;imple being, or whether thou art a threefold deity, con&s;i&s;ting of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Dear and ble&s;&s;ed God, had&s;t thou been plea&s;ed, in any one plain Scripture, to have informed me which of the different opinions about the Holy Trinity, among the contending parties of Chri&s;|tians, had been true, thou knowe&s;t with how much zeal, &s;atisfaction, and joy, my unbia&s;&s;ed heart would have opened it&s;elf to receive and embrace the di&s;covery. Had&s;t thou told me plainly in any &s;ingle text, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three real di&s;tinct per&s;ons in thy divine nature, I had never &s;uffered my&s;elf to be bewildered in &s;o many doubts, nor embar|ra&s;&s;ed with &s;o many &s;trong fears of a&s;&s;enting to the mere inventions of men, in&s;tead of divine

doctrine; but I &s;hould have humbly and imme|diately accepted thy words, &s;o far as it was po&s;|&s;ible for me to under&s;tand them, as the only rule of my faith. Or had&s;t thou been plea&s;ed &s;o to expre&s;s and include this propo&s;ition in the &s;everal &s;cattered parts of thy book, from whence my rea&s;on and con&s;cience might with ea&s;e find out, and with certainty infer this doctrine, I &s;hould have joyfully employed all my rea&s;oning powers, with their utmo&s;t &s;kill and activity, to have found out this inference,</Q> and ingrafted it into my &s;oul.</P>
<P><Q>Thou ha&s;t called the poor and the ignorant, the mean and fooli&s;h things of this world, to the knowlege of thy&s;elf and thy Son, and taught them to receive and partake of the Salvation which thou ha&s;t provided.

And can this &s;trange and perplexing notion of three real per&s;ons going to make up one true God, be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and &s;o important a part of that Chri&s;tian doctrine, which, in the old Te&s;tament and the new, is repre&s;ented as &s;o plain and &s;o ea&s;y, even to the meane&s;t under&s;tandings?</Q></P>

Whether the wi&s;e&s;t and the weake&s;t are not equally incapable of "taking in &s;o difficult, and &s;o ab&s;tru&s;e a doctrine" as that of the Trinity? Whether the Chri&s;tian doctrine concerning things &s;piritual and my&s;terious is really "repre&s;ented," either in the Old Te&s;tament or the New, as <Q>plain and ea&s;y even to the meane&s;t under&s;tanding?</Q> Whether, granting that <Q>multitudes even of men of learning and piety have lo&s;t them&s;elves in in|finite &s;ubtilties of di&s;pute, &amp;c, in the explica|tion and defence</Q> of the doctrine before us, all

this &s;hould not be principally attributed to anti|trinitarian artifice, and to a gradual departure from that &s;implicity in which it was originally taught and received in the world?

Finally, whether the doctrine of the Trinity, as held in the Church, has not at lea&s;t as much countenance from Scripture, and even from rea&s;on, as Dr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;'s notion of the <HI>indwelling of the Deity in the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> and whether this is not in effect acknowleged by him&s;elf?</P>

<Q>Since, &s;ays he, holy Scripture is the repo&s;itory of divine truths, and the great rule of faith, to which all &s;ects of Chri&s;tians do appeal for pro|bation of their &s;everal opinions, and &s;ince all agree in the articles of the Creed as things clearly and plainly &s;et down, and as containing all that which is of &s;imple and prime nece&s;&s;ity; and &s;ince on the other &s;ide there are in Scripture many other my&s;teries, and matters of que&s;tion upon which there is a vail; &s;ince there are &s;o many copies with infinite varieties of reading; &s;ince a various interpunction, a parenthe&s;is, a letter, an accent may much alter the &s;en&s;e; &s;ince &s;ome places have divers literal &s;en&s;es, many have &s;pi|ritual, my&s;tical, and allegorical meanings; &s;ince there are &s;o many tropes, metonymies, ironies, hyperboles, proprieties and improprieties of lan|guage, who&s;e under&s;tanding depends upon &s;uch circum&s;tances that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to know its proper interpretation, now that the know|lege of &s;uch circum&s;tances and particular &s;tories is irrecoverably lo&s;t; &s;ince there are &s;ome my&s;teries which, at the be&s;t advantage of expre&s;&s;ion, are not ea&s;y to be apprehended, and who&s;e explication,
<PB N="390" REF="403">
by rea&s;on of our imperfections, mu&s;t needs be dark, &s;ometimes weak, &s;ometimes unintelligible; and la&s;tly, &s;ince tho&s;e ordinary means of ex|pounding Scripture, as &s;earching the originals, conference of places, parity of rea&s;on, and ana|logy of faith, are all dubious, uncertain, and very fallible, he that is the wi&s;e&s;t and by con&s;e|quence the likelie&s;t to expound true&s;t in all pro|bability of rea&s;on, will be very far from confi|dence, becau&s;e every one of the&s;e and many more are like &s;o many degrees of improbability and incertainty, all depre&s;&s;ing our certainty of finding out truth in &s;uch my&s;teries, and amid&s;t &s;o many difficulties. And therefore a wi&s;e man that con&s;iders this, would not willingly be pre|&s;cribed to by others; and therefore if he al&s;o be a ju&s;t man, he will not impo&s;e upon others; for it is be&s;t every man &s;hould be left in that liberty from which no man can ju&s;tly take him, unle&s;s he could &s;ecure him from error. So that here al&s;o there is a nece&s;&s;ity to con&s;erve the liberty of prophe&s;ying, and interpreting Scripture; a ne|ce&s;&s;ity derived from the con&s;ideration of the dif|ficulty of Scripture in que&s;tions controverted, and the uncertainty of any internal medium of interpretation.</Q>
<P>Now if this be the ca&s;e, we are but mocked, when we are told the Scriptures are the "repo&s;itory of divine truths;" or that <HI>any</HI> articles of faith
<PB N="391" REF="404">
can be "clearly and plainly &s;et down" in any Creed what&s;oever. Under the above circum&s;tances, in what formulary, or &s;y&s;tem, &s;hall we look for <Q>all that which is of &s;imple and prime nece&s;&s;ity?</Q> Is it not &s;trange too, that there &s;hould be <HI>many other my&s;teries</HI> in Scripture di&s;tinct from tho&s;e <HI>divine truths</HI> of which it is the repo&s;itory; and &s;tranger &s;till, that matters of <HI>que&s;tion</HI> &s;hould be put under a <HI>vail?</HI> Upon all matters of <HI>faith</HI> there is indeed a vail; I mean, upon all my&s;terious matters, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly be "apprehended at the be&s;t ad|vantage of expre&s;&s;ion." The explication of <HI>the&s;e</HI> is ab&s;olutely impracticable; and every attempt for that purpo&s;e, <Q>by rea&s;on of our imperfections, mu&s;t needs be dark, &s;ometimes weak, &s;ometimes unintelligible.</Q> Perhaps he will bid as fair as any man to be an expounder of my&s;teries who &s;hall di&s;entangle the &s;everal clau&s;es of this paragraph. I know not whether any thing can be found &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing this, either in the &s;tyle, or in the &s;pirit of pre&s;ent moderation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a curious vindication of this author, (Bp.

<P>In &s;upport of all this derogation, which is oblig|ingly qualified with a few introductory common|place compliments, our author has given us a number of extracts, relative to certain religious topics, from Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Catechi&s;m, pub|li&s;hed in 1543, and dedicated to King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.

We may &s;ee, it &s;eems, from the&s;e extracts, how greatly di&s;proportioned the abilities of this famous Prelate and his colleagues were to the work of Re|formation, &amp;c. To what conclu&s;ions this will lead, I need not inform the reader. But I take leave to offer a remark or two upon the occa&s;ion. In the fir&s;t place, if the intellectual weakne&s;s of our Re|formers was really &s;o great as is here repre&s;ented, Prote&s;tants to a man have rea&s;on enough to be a&s;hamed of them&s;elves. What an&s;wer &s;hall they make to any &s;en&s;ible <HI>Roman-Catholic</HI> who &s;hould teaze them with the&s;e mortifying truths? To my thinking, as none of the exceptionable contents of the pa&s;&s;ages cited from the Arch-Bi&s;hop's Cate|chi&s;m make a part of the doctrine of our Church, they might, in reverence to <HI>his</HI> memory, and for <HI>her</HI> credit, have much better been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Had this Gentleman contented him&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that the Reformers of the Church were fallible men; and con&s;equently, that the Forms and Offices they have delivered down to us may be capable, in &s;ome in&s;tances, of alteration and improvement, he had &s;poken more agreeably to truth, though le&s;s adequately to his purpo&s;e. For what he has alledged has a plain tendency to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity rather of <HI>pulling down</HI> than <HI>repairing</HI> our &s;piritual <HI>building.</HI> On the whole, as he has conducted mat|ters, I know not any one per&s;on upon earth under &s;o many obligations to him as the Pope of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

Yet our Editor a&s;ks, <Q>is not this ex|ception, and even the mention of this circum|&s;tance, a &s;triking proof of Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s bigotted attachment to the national e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of wor&s;hip?</Q> It is really no proof at all. How far Dr. <HI>J.</HI> was in fact a bigot to e&s;tabli&s;hments, I un|dertake not to determine; but the period ju&s;t quoted by no means proves him to have been &s;o. The mo&s;t moderate Churchman breathing has not the better opinion of Dr. <HI>W.</HI> for his Non-conformity. I cannot think &s;uch an one could have "mentioned this circum&s;tance" more tenderly, had he mentioned it at all; and with what propriety Dr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;'s Bio|grapher could have left it unmentioned, I mu&s;t
<PB N="396" REF="409">
leave it to this Gentleman to explain to us. <Q>Re|verence to God, he proceeds, and benevolence to man, are the two grand e&s;&s;entials of religion. He that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the&s;e is a true Chri&s;tian, what|ever be the external mode of wor&s;hip which he adopts. Neither his Conformity nor his Non|conformity will exclude him from the divine fa|vour, nor ought it to be matter of cen&s;ure to his fellow-creatures. If a man in uniting with any Chri&s;tian community, appears to follow the dictates of his own con&s;cience, &amp;c, he de&s;erves the e&s;teem of all parties, and to object to his peculiarity of religious profe&s;&s;ion is the mark of a little mind.</Q></P>
<P>Now this is partly true, partly fal&s;e, but, you &s;ee, as far as Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> is concerned, wholly im|pertinent. There is as little as po&s;&s;ible of cen&s;ure, or of objection in the &s;entence above quoted from him. As to &s;incerity of per&s;ua&s;ion, no body de|nies the validity of it's preten&s;ions; but at the &s;ame time what will make an hone&s;t man will by no means con&s;titute a "true Chri&s;tian." <Q>Reverence to God and benevolence to man are indeed the two grand e&s;&s;entials of all religion;</Q> and, to bor|row our author's term, they MAY be <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;t</HI> by Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics.</P>
<P>"That Dr. <HI>W.</HI> was con&s;cientious in his Non-con|formity," will be readily admitted; but &s;urely this will not ju&s;tify the unfairne&s;s, or the duplicity,
<PB N="397" REF="410">
or the malignity, or the fal&s;hood of the following paragraph. <Q>Con&s;idering what the terms of mi|ni&s;terial conformity are, &s;ays our annotator, it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, whether if all the clergy were equally con&s;cientious, one half of them would not be Di&s;&s;enters. To declare an <HI>a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent</HI> to ALL and EVERY THING <HI>contained in the Thirty-nine Articles, the book of Common Prayer,</HI> &amp;c, (which comprehend &s;uch a prodigious num|ber of particulars; many of them very di&s;putable, &s;ome of them unintelligible, and others exploded by the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of men;) is &s;uch a requi|&s;ition as it is hard to be conceived the generality of the clergy can <HI>bona fide</HI> approve. It is indeed WELL KNOWN that MOST of them, and even of the BISHOPS them&s;elves, di&s;believe &s;ome of the doctrinal articles of the Church, as appears from the general &s;train of their preaching and of their writings, and that they profe&s;s to &s;ub&s;cribe them only as articles of peace. If the terms of conformity were a declaration that they <HI>did not believe</HI> "all and every thing, &amp;c," it is unde|niable that many (not to &s;ay the mo&s;t) of tho&s;e that conform might very con&s;cientiou&s;ly make it. Whether therefore their &s;ub&s;cription to the pre|&s;ent terms be con&s;i&s;tent with &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, it behoves them &s;eriou&s;ly to enquire. If others think that &s;uch a &s;ub&s;cription would, in them, be a gro&s;s prevarication, and rather than
<PB N="398" REF="411">
be chargeable with it, willingly forego the ad|vantages of being in the Church, they ought at lea&s;t to be re&s;pected as hone&s;t men. And if Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> had &s;tudied the grounds of Non-con|formity (which he appears not to have done) he might have entertained a better opinion of the under&s;tandings of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters as well as their integrity.

<P>If the&s;e repre&s;entations are ju&s;t, and the&s;e a&s;&s;er|tions true, the controver&s;y is ab&s;olutely decided with a vengeance; and the bulk of the clergy of of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are as great a &s;et of &s;c&mdash;ndr&mdash;ls as can be produced in the annals of the human race.

<P>In &s;hort, we are not to wonder at any thing which is advanced by one who maintains, as this writer does in another page of this very perform|ance, that <Q>in the Scripture-plan no traces of a national Church, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, are to be found.</Q></P>

It may be pertinent to remark farther, that <HI>ex|ceedingly mad</HI> as the Puritans and their friends in the la&s;t century were <HI>again&s;t</HI> the governors of the Church, and our whole eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity, THEY appear to have been more than ordinarily &s;olicitous to expre&s;s their full <HI>a&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to the mo&s;t material articles of our faith.

<P>With a view to the &s;olution of this difficulty, and by way of Supplement to the contents of the foregoing &s;heets, let us &s;ee whether a little enquiry will not enable us &s;ufficiently to a&s;certain what he|re&s;y of the wor&s;t &s;ort was in the days of the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, and according to the conception they mu&s;t by fair con&s;truction be under&s;tood to have entertained of it.</P>
<P>In his 2d general Epi&s;tle St. <HI>Peter</HI> foretells that there would be <HI>fal&s;e teachers</HI> among Chri&s;tians, <HI>who</HI> &s;hould <HI>privily bring in damnable here&s;ies,</HI> EVEN <HI>de|nying the Lord that bought them.</HI> (ch. 2. v. 1.)

<P>Now whether we do, or do not abide by Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI>'s interpretation, who apprehends we are to under&s;tand God the Father by the word <HI>Lord</HI> in this pa&s;&s;age, <Q>Chri&s;t being never &s;tyled <GAP DESC="foreign"> (the original word) in the New Te&s;tament,</Q> the in|ference

<P>In his la&s;t and farewell addre&s;s to the <HI>Children of I&s;rael,</HI> which is called his <HI>Song,</HI> their great Legi|&s;lator puts this que&s;tion to them, <HI>is not he thy father that hath bought thee?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deutero.

<P>There is a pa&s;&s;age in St. <HI>Jude,</HI> parallel to this which we have had in con&s;ideration, that will not be found con&s;i&s;tent with it, or with its context, without &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ame equality.

<P>If we take into examination that impious and &s;trange doctrine of which St. <HI>John</HI> &s;peaks in terms of &s;trong cen&s;ure and re&s;entment, in his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;econd general Epi&s;tle,</HI> this re&s;earch will likewi&s;e ter|minate in an unque&s;tionable proof of our Lord's Divinity; and convince us, that in the denial of it the error con&s;i&s;ted. <HI>Every Spirit that confe&s;&s;eth not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h, is not of God: and this is that Spirit of anti-chri&s;t, whereof ye have heard, &amp;c.

This doctrine is delivered in the <HI>Koran</HI> in general terms; but the
<PB N="407" REF="420">
followers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> differ in their &s;entiments re|&s;pecting it. According to &s;ome, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was not nailed to the Cro&s;s, but a malefactor who in per&s;on much re&s;embled him.

<P>Or if we &s;uppo&s;e St. <HI>John</HI> to have had in his eye another heretical tenet of a &s;imilar nature and ten|dency, which was very early di&s;&s;eminated in the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the <HI>Carpocratians,</HI> &amp;c, who made a di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and maintained, that the former &s;uffered, and ro&s;e again, but that the latter was impa&s;&s;ible, as being purely of a &s;piritual nature; (agreeably to the idea &s;ugge&s;ted by <HI>Web&s;ter</HI>'s tran&s;lation of Father <HI>Simon,</HI> which for <HI>every Spirit which confe&s;&s;eth not,</HI> &amp;c, reads which <HI>&s;eparateth Je&s;us;)</HI> the re&s;ult will nece&s;&s;arily be found to be one and the &s;ame.

<P>Now how all this could be done; or how either <HI>Evangeli&s;t, Prophet,</HI> or <HI>Teacher,</HI> or Governor could at <HI>any</HI> time, or in <HI>any</HI> manner, exerci&s;e his function, without invading the right of private judgment, as it has of late days been contended for; or with|out departing from the <HI>&s;implicity</HI> of the Go&s;pel in its original &s;tate, I pretend not to have &s;ufficient penetration to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>Matters appear then to &s;tand thus.&mdash;That <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> con&s;tituted no arbitrator, no infallible judge, or decider of controver&s;y, &amp;c, in his Church, is demon&s;trable from the differences, the di&s;putes, and di&s;&s;entions, relative to <HI>circumci&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in its very infancy. At the &s;ame time it is certain the Holy Scriptures &s;peak of a <HI>common faith, and of the common &s;alvation.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus i. 4. Jude v. 3.</NOTE>You have &s;een

what grounds we have for our per&s;ua&s;ion that &s;uch <HI>common faith</HI> was nothing more or le&s;s than a be|lief in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and the other articles contained in our Creeds. Under this per&s;ua&s;ion, the Church of England, as a national Church, as a Church reformed from the gro&s;s errors, corruptions, and &s;uper&s;titions of <HI>Rome,</HI> has not only "power to decree rites, or ceremonies, but authority in controver&s;ies of faith;" <HI>viz.</HI> au|thority, not to determine, but to declare. Accord|ingly we do not anathemati&s;e, or mole&s;t them that renounce our Doctrine, or &s;eparate from our Di&s;|cipline, upon principles avowed by our&s;elves. We maintain our own rights without encroaching upon the privileges of others. We "di&s;cover, condemn, and avoid" what we call and believe to be here&s;ies, without aiming, or wi&s;hing to prevent them by coercion. We conceive &s;piritual government to be as compatible with religious liberty, as temporal juri&s;diction is with civil; and that when the Re|formers a&s;&s;erted the right of private judgment in matters of religion, the natural right of all men to make u&s;e of their own faculties, <Q>they could not po&s;&s;ibly mean to inve&s;t every individual with the privilege of working out his own &s;alvation by his own under&s;tanding and endeavours,</Q> inde|pendently on any extraneous a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or in&s;truc|tion whatever; and much le&s;s to intimate, that he

is under an indi&s;pen&s;able obligation &s;o to do. Were this the ca&s;e, the Apo&s;tle's que&s;tion, <HI>are all Teachers</HI> mu&s;t be an&s;wered in the affirma|tive; and the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence would be, that EVERY BODY, and yet NO BODY would be a <HI>Teacher.</HI> Which is ab&s;urd. Neither the ju&s;te&s;t claim, nor the mo&s;t rea&s;onable exemption can alter the nature of things. If it be true, that this Church derives her exi&s;tence from the exertions of human rea&s;on, emancipating it&s;elf from &s;piritual &s;lavery; it is as true, that &s;he owes her pre&s;erva|tion to decent order, and legal e&s;tabli&s;hment. If it be true, that the bulk of the people naturally wi&s;h to act, to think, and to judge for them&s;elves; it is as true, that they naturally take advice or in|&s;truction from others, &s;ubmit to controul, and re|verence authority. In &s;hort, to whatever cau&s;es we are to a&s;cribe that diver&s;ity of opinion which di&s;|tracts the world; how perplexing &s;o ever the pre|&s;ent con&s;titution of things may be; or for what|ever rea&s;ons it has plea&s;ed infinite wi&s;dom to place us in a &s;tate of trial, infirmity, and imperfection; one general truth mu&s;t univer&s;ally be &s;ub&s;cribed to; <HI>viz.</HI> that, with re&s;pect both to faith and prac|tice, <HI>the Lord knoweth them that are his,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 19.</NOTE>and will hereafter acknowlege them accordingly.</P>
