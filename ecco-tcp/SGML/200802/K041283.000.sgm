<L>_O CHESTERFIELD! My Patron and my Pride,</L>
<L>In whom does all that's Great and Good re&s;ide;</L>
<L>Noble by Birth, by Liberal Arts refin'd;</L>
<L>Delight of Heav'n, and Darling of Mankind!</L>
<L>The publick Patriot, and the private Friend;</L>

<L>The Mu&s;e's Silence, if, hereafter mute,</L>
<L>She quits her former Toils for future Ea&s;e;</L>
<L>And checks that Genius which (perhaps) might plea&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis Time my fruitle&s;s Labours to decline,</L>
<L>When all Men's Works can climb the Stage, but mine:</L>
<L>When, in my &s;tead, behold! a motley Herd</L>
<L>Of up&s;tart Witlings to my &s;elf preferr'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not &s;o when <HI>Booth, Wilks, Cibber,</HI> rul'd the Stage,</L>
<L>Dramatick Ornaments of this our Age:</L>
<L>My &s;mall Attempts to plea&s;e were then approv'd,</L>
<L>And not for ev'ry trifling <HI>Farce</HI> remov'd.</L>
<L><HI>Booth</HI> ever &s;hew'd me <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Wilks</HI> wou'd rather forward than reject.</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Cibber,</HI> Terror to the Scribbling Crew!</L>
<L>Would oft Sollicit me for &s;omething New.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, Younger Rulers Younger Authors take,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4">The&s;e handy Hirelings can, in half a Day,</L>
<L>Steal a new Ballad FARCE from &s;ome old PLAY;</L>
<L>To mangled Scraps of many an Ancient Tune</L>
<L>Tagg Feetle&s;s Jingle, Jarring and Jejune;</L>
<L>The jaded Play'rs with equal ha&s;te rehear&s;e,</L>
<L>'Till Sing Song limps, to Horrid! Hobbling Ver&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' Blunder follows Blunder, Line by Line,</L>
<L>The 'Squire is taught to think <HI>'tis wond'rous Fine</HI>!</L>
<L>It &s;uits his Ta&s;te, he gives his plaudit Voice,</L>
<L>And &s;hews his Under&s;tanding in his Choice.</L>
<L>Framing Conceptions both of Men and Things,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t as Sir <HI>Figg</HI> directs his Leading-Strings:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sir <HI>Figg,</HI> grand Ma&s;ter of the double Sneer,</L>
<L>Who, when He mo&s;t deceives, &s;eems mo&s;t Sincere;</L>
<L>Di&s;&s;embler Born, but much improv'd by Art,</L>
<L>A Friendly A&s;pect, an Infernal Heart:</L>
<L>The Mi&s;chievous, the Bu&s;y <HI>Go between</HI></L>
<L>Ea&s;y 'Squire <HI>Amb's-Ace,</HI> and &s;ly <HI>Harlequin</HI>;</L>
<L>Who, like two wrangling Coun&s;ellors at Bar,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5">But yet, in Private, like dear Friends care&s;s,</L>
<L>And form De&s;igns, poor Players to di&s;tre&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Woe to the Stage! if once their Schemes Succeed;</L>
<L>Actors will then be Abject Slaves indeed:</L>
<L>Poets had better lay their Pens a&s;ide,</L>
<L>Than tamely truckle to Stage Tyrant's Pride;</L>
<L>Who, Vain and Partial, keep Old Authors down,</L>
<L>To force their own Low Trump'ry on the Town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why to &s;uch Wretches &s;hould I yeild my Cau&s;e,</L>
<L>So lately honour'd with &s;o much Applau&s;e?</L>
<L>My little Ballads &s;till on ev'ry Tongue,</L>
<L>Are in polite&s;t Conver&s;ation Sung:</L>
<L>Nor can &s;evere&s;t Cen&s;ure trace one Line.</L>
<L>That tends to Vice, in any Ver&s;e of mine.</L>
<L>To plea&s;e and yet in&s;truct is all my Aim,</L>
<L>Let Venal Poeta&s;ters boa&s;t the &s;ame;</L>
<L>Who&s;e utmo&s;t Views are to corrupt the Ta&s;te,</L>
<L>To &s;ooth the Vicious, and to &s;hock the Cha&s;te;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6">And, quite e&s;trang'd to any Sen&s;e of Shame,</L>
<L>Make Women &s;peak what Rakes wou'd blu&s;h to name;</L>
<L>Then, in Excu&s;e, plead Nothing el&s;e goes down;</L>
<L>A wretched Compliment upon the Town!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wretched as fal&s;e&mdash;The Town's not &s;o deprav'd,</L>
<L>Were Authors and were Actors le&s;s en&s;lav'd:</L>
<L>Could one good Piece be &s;uffer'd to appear,</L>
<L>The Town wou'd gladly lend a candid Ear;</L>
<L>Prefer pure Nature and the &s;imple SCENE,</L>
<L>To all the <HI>Monkey Tricks</HI> of <HI>Harlequin:</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Man of Ta&s;te</HI> proves this A&s;&s;ertion true,</L>
<L>We want what's rational as well as New.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, this Declen&s;ion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Stage,</L>
<L>BOOTH, <HI>Britain's Ro&s;cius,</HI> ju&s;tly did pre&s;age;</L>
<L>That Rules Dramatic, Humour, Ta&s;te and Wit,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t to that Mon&s;ter <HI>Pantomime</HI> &s;ubmit:</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Pantomime,</HI> in all its Grandeur dre&s;t,</L>
<L>Is but a pompous <HI>Puppet-Shew</HI> at be&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
<L>Then, farewell Stage! be Bu&s;'ne&s;s now my Boa&s;t,</L>
<L>With what was Irk&s;ome once Delighted mo&s;t;</L>
<L>Pleas'd and contented with my little Store,</L>
<L>I &s;corn to pro&s;titute my Mu&s;e for more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! What Fame, what Gain can I propo&s;e,</L>
<L>When others Father fa&s;t as I compo&s;e?</L>
<L>To &s;uch a pitch is pert Pre&s;umption grown,</L>
<L>'Tis well if this Poor Piece be thought my own.</L>
<L>So when, long &s;ince, in &s;imple Sonnet Lays,</L>
<L>I made the 'Prentice Sing his <HI>Sally</HI>'s Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Tho' rude the Numbers, yet the Subject mov'd;</L>
<L>Immortal ADDISON the Song approv'd;</L>
<L>Then Prejudice with Envy did combine,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e 'twas Good, 'twas thought too Good for mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So common Fame did various Authors chu&s;e</L>
<L>To <HI>Namby Pamby,</HI> Offspring of my Mu&s;e;</L>
<L>Till POPE, who ever prov'd to Truth a Friend,</L>
<L>With Gen'rous Ardour did my Cau&s;e defend;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8">Trac'd me ob&s;cure and in Detraction's Spite</L>
<L>Di&s;play'd me in a more con&s;picuous Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To mention more wou'd prove a needle&s;s Task,</L>
<L>Why &s;hou'd they not be mine? That's all I ask:</L>
<L>Becau&s;e I'm Chearful, Unre&s;erv'd and Free,</L>
<L>Can nothing Good or New proceed from me?</L>
<L>What have I done, injurious to Mankind,</L>
<L>My Works mu&s;t be to other Men a&s;&s;ign'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well! let 'em go, I all my Right re&s;ign,</L>
<L>Entirely Ea&s;y, had they ne'er been mine:</L>
<L>Yet, this Reflection con&s;olates my Fate,</L>
<L>I &s;ee my Error e'er it proves too late.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more half Maz'd I hurry thro' the Town,</L>
<L>With Magazines of Projects in my Crown:</L>
<L>While Pyrate Printers rob me of my Gain,</L>
<L>And reap the labour'd Harve&s;t of my Brain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="9" MS="y">
<L>Like other Men, I walk a common Pace,</L>
<L>Nor run through <HI>London</HI> one continued Race;</L>
<L>But know When, Where and What I am to do,</L>
<L>You'll think tis &s;trange, <HI>My Lord!</HI> but yet 'tis true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice welcome, Sweet Tranquillity of Mind!</L>
<L>I now a Trea&s;ure in Contentment find;</L>
<L>Can labour or relax when e'er I plea&s;e,</L>
<L>And boa&s;t I've once enjoy'd a moment's Ea&s;e;</L>
<L>Of all a Moderate Man can wi&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>
<L>But mo&s;t in &s;uch a Godlike <HI>Patron</HI> ble&s;t.</L>
<L>Beneath the Sacred Sanction of who&s;e Name,</L>
<L>I build my pre&s;ent Peace, my future Fame.</L>
