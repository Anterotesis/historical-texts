<HEAD>THE LIFE OF JOHN WILKES, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>MOST ages have produced &s;ome &s;hining models of undaunted virtue and unabating patrioti&s;m.&mdash;It is the part of the Biographer to &s;elect characters from the ma&s;s of mankind, and to hold tho&s;e only up to view who have been mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ed on the va&s;t theatre of human

life. Were men to be promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly de&s;cribed, little advantage would be derived from reviewing the annals of pa&s;t or pre&s;ent times, and the eye, after a glance, would turn away with wearine&s;s, as from an unbounded plain, or a mirror, where all objects were pre&s;ented indi&s;criminately.&mdash;But if others have laboured under the di&s;advantage of de&s;cribing cha|racters equally mixed with right and wrong, the Author here has little rea&s;on to complain of &s;uch blended materials.&mdash;He gives one, bold, enterprizing, and the &s;ame, ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing uniform principles,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
without deviation and without ambiguity.</P>
<P>A man, &s;ays <HI>Plutarch,</HI> to be completely great, mu&s;t be born in &s;ome famous city.&mdash;<HI>London</HI> boa&s;ts the birth of Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI>&mdash; His mother, it is reported, was delivered without pain or labour; and a &s;pectre appeared to the nur&s;e, which foretold that the child &s;he then &s;uckled, &s;hould prove the ornament and &s;up|port of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire: cir|cum&s;tances which to many would have appeared trifling and enthu|&s;ia&s;tic, had not his future con|duct
<PB N="4" REF="6">
evinced the truth of the prediction.</P>
<P>Of his Family nothing is re|ported but in extreams; for whil&s;t &s;ome would have him to be the &s;on of a di&s;tiller, and bred up to the ca&s;k, others trace him up to a mo&s;t illu&s;trious origin: but when &s;ome of his friends judg|ed that he &s;hould change his name before he engaged in &s;tate affairs, he prettily enough repli|ed, that he would make the name of <HI>Wilkes</HI> more glorious than that of a <HI>Catiline</HI> or a <HI>Cade</HI>; and when having &s;erved the high
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and important office of Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> and the citizens were de|&s;irous of making an oblation of &s;ilver plate to him, &s;o far from renouncing his origin, that he de&s;ired his figure with a dagger in his hand to de&s;troy a monarch, &s;hould be engraved on the &s;ide of a large Drinking Cup.</P>
<P>Now he being, as <HI>Plato</HI> &s;ays a &s;cholar ought to be, di&s;po&s;ed to all manner of learning, and neglectful of no arts, cultivated, be&s;ides his other &s;tudies, an early ta&s;te for poetry, and with &s;uch

<P>But the never-to-be-forgotten work was the <HI>North Briton,</HI> or rather the N^o 45 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All numbers that have proved fortunate to this country from that time, have always terminated in <HI>Forty-five</HI>; and it is very re|markable, that the Number <HI>Nine,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>Four</HI> and a <HI>Five,</HI> &s;hould em|phatically be &s;tiled the Cur&s;e of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> of that cele|brated

paper, written by the late Reverend Mr. <HI>Churchill,</HI> and containing many &s;pirited attacks again&s;t government, which not being well received, a proce&s;s was preferred again&s;t the author. Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> being never likely to have a more fair or honourable introduction to glory, generou&s;ly declared the paper to be his own, &mdash;defied all government, and has been admired and rewarded for it. In &s;hort, in all his writings, whether he arraigned the opi|nions of others, or e&s;tabli&s;hed any doctrines of his own, there were always found both the harmony
<PB N="10" REF="12">
of order, and the decency of re|ligion. &mdash;His rea&s;ons were &s;olid and convincing, his inductions plea&s;ing and agreeable; he was ma&s;ter of every &s;ubject of which he treated, and treated none but what were amply for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>But <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> at that time had not the plea&s;ure of Mr. <HI>Bull</HI>'s acquaintance.</NOTE> fearing &s;ome Creditors, and having &s;uffered in a Duel, he travelled into <HI>France</HI> with many other great men, for the recovery of his health and fortune. There
<PB N="11" REF="13">
he lived in ea&s;e and affluence, &s;upplied with money from the di&s;intere&s;ted in <HI>England,</HI> as well as with large &s;ums ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of Jewels, and other ar|ticles which his &s;kill and ad|dre&s;s procured him abroad.&mdash;His body daily gaining &s;trength, he was &s;oon mo&s;t earne&s;tly &s;ollicited to return to <HI>England,</HI> where he again furbi&s;hed up his Rhetoric, and re-excited all his political fa|culties. For &s;ome time he wi&s;h|ed to have retired to his e&s;tate at <HI>Ayle&s;bury,</HI> but thinking it wrong to give the trouble of long jour|nies to tho&s;e who made &s;uit to
<PB N="12" REF="14">
him, he gave up his e&s;tate there to be divided among&s;t his friends, and then re&s;ided altogether in town, for the convenience of pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s; and indeed there were not fewer attending at his door, than formerly on <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> for his wealth, or <HI>Pompey</HI> for his power.</P>
<P>And now being full of ex|pectation, and &s;olely bent on the welfare of the public, he con|&s;ulted an oracle how he &s;hould &s;oone&s;t arrive at the Summit of all Political Glory.&mdash;The <HI>Pythi|an</HI> replied, &mdash; that he mu&s;t re|nounce
<PB N="13" REF="15">
his con&s;tituents at <HI>Ayle&s;|bury,</HI> and make the opinion of the <HI>Londoners,</HI> the rule and guide of his life.&mdash;The decrees of fate are irre&s;i&s;tible.&mdash;Indeed he would have &s;ubmitted to have repre&s;ent|ed the city of <HI>London</HI>; but his friends mo&s;t prudently prevented him, and compelled him to blaze out at once as the Member for <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> amid&s;t the united ac|clamations of a grateful king|dom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Twelve men, from a &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, drew Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> through the city; and, as appeared from one of his agents books, agreed only for the &s;mall &s;um of twelve pound twelve, as a gratuity for their &s;ervices.</NOTE>.&mdash;From this happy event every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> might ju&s;tly

have expected to have dated the aera of his felicity. &mdash; A Legi&s;la|tor repre&s;enting (what is called) the fir&s;t County, burning with a religious zeal to execute his im|portant charge, and fully qua|lified to regulate with an eye of intuition every the minute&s;t de|viation from the ju&s;t equilibre of church and &s;tate: but &s;uch, alas! is the fate of all human things, that the people were no &s;ooner put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, than they were deprived
<PB N="15" REF="17">
of it. &mdash; The Parliament &s;poke &s;paringly of his merits, and as he had been impri&s;oned for trea&s;on and bla&s;phemy, were willing to vindicate one bad action by com|mitting another. &mdash; They a&s;&s;erted, that as
<Q>no felon was eligible in|to any important office, a man &s;o like a felon, that he could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed, ought certainly to be expelled:</Q>
but let me remind the&s;e gentlemen, that the contrary was ju&s;tified by many of the mo&s;t experienc|ed lawyers at that time, and has &s;ince been well explained by the
<PB N="16" REF="18">
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> neither takes his &s;eat in parliament, nor re&s;ides at the Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e, he had undoubtedly a Majority of Voices for both.</NOTE> <HI>Majority</HI> of the city of <HI>London,</HI> who are now fully convinced that felony, though puni&s;hable in a private man, is by no means a di&s;qualification for a Lord Mayor. &mdash;The Head, &s;ay the be&s;t Lo|gicians, is no Member.</P>
<P>He was now not only deprived of his legal &s;eat, but &s;hut up from day-light within the melancholy confines of a gloomy pri&s;on: &mdash; but the&s;e hard&s;hips he could well
<PB N="17" REF="19">
have borne him&s;elf, but his Hu|manity was alarmed for the wel|fare of others.&mdash;"All hone&s;t Free|holders (as Lord <HI>Chatham</HI> beauti|fully expre&s;&s;ed it) were mo&s;t dread|fully aggrieved, from the Banks of the <HI>Tweed</HI> to the Lands-end in <HI>Cornwall</HI>; they &s;lept not in their beds from horrid dreams and midnight apprehen&s;ions: but it was not in dreams, alas! they had in vain implored the ju&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a relentle&s;s Monarch:" &mdash; tender and pathetic as this lamentation was, there yet was found a Peer hardy enough to
<PB N="18" REF="20">
&s;ay, "that the County in which he lived, as well as five or &s;ix more adjoining, had not only not pe|titioned, but he believed felt no grievances, and he was &s;orry the Noble Lord would not allow him one hone&s;t Freeholder in his neighbourhood."&mdash;This appear|ed to many but as ill-timed raillery, and &s;o far from invali|dating the truth of the Great O|rator's a&s;&s;ertion, that it only af|forded a melancholy proof of Lord <HI>Sandwich</HI>'s apo&s;tacy. &mdash; I will not dwell on the many dreadful con&s;equences attending Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI>'s expul&s;ion, &mdash; the
<PB N="19" REF="21">
reader, the generous reader, feels the weight of them too forcibly, and I &s;ee him with tears in his eyes lamenting that luckle&s;s hour, when virtue was &s;trip'd of its or|nament, hone&s;ty of its robe, and a fatal, an everla&s;ting blow was given to the very vitals of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;terial Hirelings now daily echoed reproaches again&s;t him; &mdash; they in&s;inuated that he had defrauded the Foundling Ho&s;pital, and burnt Mr. <HI>Sylva</HI>'s Notes.&mdash;The latter was the only circum&s;tance that &s;eemed to en|danger
<PB N="20" REF="22">
his credit in the city;&mdash; it was a bad precedent, and they feared it might prove dangerous to trade:&mdash; weak minds cannot always weigh the comparative merits of actions,&mdash;bad mea&s;ures mu&s;t frequently be applied to good ends, and private hone&s;ty is oft-times ab&s;olutely incompatible with publick patrioti&s;m; &mdash; by many it was called, at lea&s;t, an act of inattention: &mdash;but would it not have been deemed as the height of ab&s;urdity that a <HI>Cicero</HI> or a <HI>Maecenas</HI> &s;hould have &s;top|ped to have regulated a Grocer's bill, when the welfare of millions
<PB N="21" REF="23">
depended on their public coun|&s;els? &mdash;<HI>Pericles,</HI> one of the mo&s;t admired heroes of antiquity, when his accounts were confu&s;ed, and could not well be given up, not only de&s;troyed the Notes (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) but to drown the remembrance, involved his coun|try in the <HI>Peloponne&s;ian</HI> war.&mdash; But I will place the matter in its true light.&mdash; The Notes were given to a <HI>Jew</HI>&mdash;he was im|portunate, &mdash; Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> was obliged to turn him out of his hou&s;e in his own defence; for, is not a <HI>Jew</HI> bound, whenever it is in his power, to de&s;troy that man
<PB N="22" REF="24">
who is known to be a &s;trenuous a&s;&s;ertor of the laws of Chri&s;tiani|ty?&mdash;As to the Foundling Ho&s;|pital, Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> con&s;idered it as a ba&s;e In&s;titution from the be|ginning,&mdash; it encouraged Ba&s;|tardy;&mdash;however, he &s;ubmitted the whole tran&s;action to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Taylor White.</NOTE> Trea&s;urer, who&s;e private virtues might be &s;aid to go hand in hand with his own, and from who&s;e repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e, the city &s;eemed &s;o well &s;atisfied of their equal integrity, that they gave an entire credit to the one, and by choo&s;ing the other Al|derman,
<PB N="23" REF="25">
not only made him the Guardian of public tru&s;t, but of cour&s;e Governor to almo&s;t all other Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>The Honour of being Alder|man likewi&s;e entitled him to the high and important office of She|riff, which afforded him many favourable opportunities of di&s;|playing his Humanity; &mdash; he felt mo&s;t tenderly for tho&s;e who partook of one common nature with him&s;elf, and in his Zeal for Liberty, not only ordered their chains to be &s;truck off during their trials, but in&s;i&s;ted on their
<PB N="24" REF="26">
removal from <HI>Newgate,</HI> to be more immediately under his own in&s;pection, that he might occa|&s;ionally in&s;truct them in their &s;everal duties, and let them out at proper times to practi&s;e their different occupations, in order to di&s;charge the jailors fees.&mdash; Nor was this glorious plan of Li|berty confined to one &s;et of men only &mdash; all ranks, all orders, in &s;ome degree felt the weight of his influence.&mdash; The me&s;&s;engers and officers who before had u&s;ed to take up any man whom the Parliament deemed highly crimi|nal, now tremble lea&s;t the Lord

<HI>Wil&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Horne</HI> that Reli|gion is Impo&s;ture. &mdash; Nor is this the &s;y&s;tem of a day only, but the education of our youth is calcu|lated to inculcate the&s;e generous principles:&mdash;the poor Apprentice, who before had u&s;ed to read his Bible in the evening, or play at Cribbage with his Mi&s;tre&s;s, now leaves the hou&s;e, and di&s;cour&s;es like a <HI>Lacedaemonian,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P>Not even the Military could repre&s;s Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI>'s ardour: &mdash; at his in&s;tigation tho&s;e &s;plendid Hirelings were re&s;trained from carrying arms through the city, &mdash; their very drum was &s;ilenced, and they were taught, that though they were kept at a va&s;t expence to parade in <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> and now and then to be reviewed, yet they were to be con&s;idered as the or|nament, not as the &s;ecurity of the State, and it was uncon&s;titutional
<PB N="28" REF="30">
for them to interfere, though the Life of their Sovereign was at|tacked in his Palace.</P>
<P>Nor were tho&s;e learned Gentle|men of the Long Robe more &s;e|cure in their dignities. &mdash; Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> could explain to a <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> Jury, that the King had no right to the Land-tax, &mdash; that his power and that of the Parliament was not equal to that of a Petty Con|&s;table's; and it was illegal for him in any in&s;tance to extend his mercy when the people clamour|ed for blood: &mdash; nay, when the late Judge <HI>Yates</HI> pre&s;umed only,
<PB N="29" REF="31">
in pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence on Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> to glance at his poem, by &s;peak|ing of the reverence due to Chri|&s;tianity &mdash; the people (&s;uch was the Patriot's popularity) laughed him openly to &s;corn, though Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> him&s;elf with great polite|ne&s;s and candour &s;aid, that
<Q>now and then it was not ami&s;s to hear a mu&s;ty &s;ermon.</Q></P>
<P>He might even be &s;aid to be out of the power of Medicine; for on the Parliament de&s;iring a Phy&s;ician to in&s;pect him, whil&s;t in danger from a duel, he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Hebberden</HI> for being illi|terate,
<PB N="30" REF="32">
and ordered no one to in|terfere, unle&s;s they would &s;end nur&s;e <HI>Grenv&mdash;e</HI> her&s;elf to admi|ni&s;ter a gli&s;ter.</P>
<P>By extending the liberty of the Pre&s;s, all public and private characters are now fully delineat|ed: &mdash;from this great prerogative, the birth-right of all <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> we are enabled to &s;peak truth with impunity &mdash; to &s;ay, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Junius</HI> and others.</NOTE> a "<HI>Mansfield</HI> has no integrity, a <HI>Grafton</HI> no abilities, and that the Duke of <HI>Bedford</HI> rejoiced at the

death of his only &s;on, &mdash; that the per&s;on of our Sovereign is ungra|cious, &mdash; his manners depraved, his private character immoral, and his public one unju&s;t, &mdash; that he is the wor&s;t orator that ever &s;poke to a parliament, &mdash; a parent un|concerned in the welfare of his family, &mdash; has no care for the State, but, like <HI>Nero,</HI> "fiddles whil&s;t <HI>Rome</HI> is burning."</P>
<P>The Fine Arts live not but in a &s;tate of Liberty, but now they flouri&s;h'd in all their branches;&mdash; Mu&s;ic was united with Poetry, and Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> their <HI>Apollo,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="34">

<P>It was Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI>'s peculiar happine&s;s to be always connected with characters &s;imilar to his own, as they &s;ay the Magnet at|tracts
<PB N="34" REF="36">
only tho&s;e fragments that are of kindred qualities: but now and then the&s;e fragments were at enmity among&s;t them&s;elves:&mdash; when altercations aro&s;e about the di&s;po&s;al of Places, or the di&s;tribu|tion of Public Money, they har|rangued &s;o freely on their compa|rative merits, that though I have no doubt but they all &s;poke Truth of one another, yet I think it was &s;ometimes rather impolitic &s;o fully to unveil to the common eye the deeper my&s;teries of Patri|otic Duty.</P>
