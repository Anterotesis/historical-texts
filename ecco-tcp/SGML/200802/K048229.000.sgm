<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>FINDING among the different pieces I have compo&s;ed for Ranelagh and the Theatre a number of Ballads which I took great pains with, and which have been but little heard, I thought I could not better employ my lei&s;ure time than in furni&s;hing upon &s;ome fa|miliar plan the dialogue nece&s;&s;ary to work up the&s;e materials into a Ballad Farce, a &s;pecies of entertainment which has always been well re|ceived, and which as it has lain dormant for &s;ome time, I thought would have &s;o far the charms of novelty to recommend it.</P>
<P>I had heard of a piece of this &s;ort, which has the characters of a Waterman and a Gardener in it; and the &s;cene of which is laid at Bat|ter&s;ea: This I enquired after, but was informed it was out of print; I neverthele&s;s liked the idea of tho&s;e two characters &s;o well, that I de|termined
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
to pur&s;ue the hint as for as it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for my purpo&s;e; I dare &s;ay it mu&s;t be evident to every one that I have done no more; I never read the piece in que&s;tion, nor do I for a certainty at this moment know the title of it.</P>
<P>I mention this circum&s;tance becau&s;e I am re|&s;olved to acknowledge at all times from whence I collect any matter for the trifles I may have an opportunity of pre&s;enting to the public. I mu&s;t be an egregious egoti&s;t indeed, and little entitled to the indulgence they have hitherto favoured me with, if I could be &s;o uncon&s;cious of my own inability as to &s;uppo&s;e I ever can pre&s;ent them with any thing worthy their notice with|out a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this &s;ort; be&s;ide, in this I am &s;erving my&s;elf, for I mu&s;t be well convinced, the mo&s;t effectual way to &s;ecure their indul|gence is to deal as hone&s;tly by them as they deal generou&s;ly by every man in my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>With regard to the performers, if I men|tioned the merit of any one in particular, I
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
&s;hould do inju&s;tice to the re&s;t; I &s;hall there|fore &s;ay in general, that their a&s;&s;iduity has been unwearied upon this, as well as upon every other &s;imilar occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The piece is indeed incomparably performed, and it is very apparent that the greate&s;t part of its &s;ucce&s;s is owing to this circum&s;tance.</P>

<P>This, now, is my delight, to &s;it at breakfa&s;t while the men work.

<P>Why, Ma&s;ter Bundle, I have often-times thought to my&s;elf, that it was a wonder&s;ome kind of thing, how it came to pa&s;s, that you two agree &s;o badly; when, out of all the four and twenty hours, you are hardly ever above two of them together.</P>

<P>No, nor then neither; every thing mu&s;t be her way, or there's no getting any peace. As &s;oon as the marketing's over in town, away &s;he and her favourite Robin, trudge to the two-&s;hilling gallery of one of the play-hou&s;es; where they have pick'd up &s;uch a pack of damn'd non&s;en&s;e, about &s;entiments and &s;tuff, that I am not only obliged to put up with her &s;colding me all the time I do &s;ee her, but I am &s;colded in a language I don't under&s;tand.</P>

<P>Ay, there was another of her freaks; &s;he was then as fond of romances, as &s;he is now of plays; and though my father, who was as plain a man as my&s;elf, &s;wore he would not leave us a farthing, if we did not call the girl Margery; nothing would &s;atisfy her for&s;ooth, but we mu&s;t give her the name of Wilelmina:&mdash;'Tis &s;uch a damn'd, confounded, hard name, that I was a matter of three years before I cou'd pronounce it right.</P>

<P>IS it not a mo&s;t marvellous thing, Mr. Bundle, that I mu&s;t be &s;uch an eternal &s;lave to my family, in this here manner, while you and your cologuing companions are be&s;otting, and &s;quandering away your time with your guzzling, and every thing goes to rack and manger.

<P>You are a very good wife to be &s;ure, my dear, only a little inclined to talking; if you, now, had no tongue, or I had no ears, we &s;hould be the happie&s;t couple in the world.</P>

<P>I don't direct my di&s;cour&s;e to you, Sir; but tis my hu&s;band that encourages you to behave in &s;uch a bruti&s;h and outrageous manner.

<P>Why, to marry me: To be certain you won't find me like your Mr. Robin, an incon&s;idera|tive puppy, that will &s;ay more in half an hour, than he'll &s;tand to in half a year! I am a little too much of an Engli&s;hman, I thank you, Mi&s;s, for that; my heart lies in the right place, and as we &s;ay, 'tis not always the be&s;t looking boat that goes the &s;afe&s;t.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>TUG.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what, Mi&s;s, if you don't marry me, till I make &s;uch a fool of my&s;elf, 'tis my mind you'll never marry me at all. I love you to be &s;artain, there's nobody can &s;ay to the contrary of that; but you'll never catch me at your Cupids and Weni&s;&s;es;
<PB N="11" REF="16">
I am plain, and downright; I'd do all that in my power lay to make you happy, if you'd have me, and if you won't, I have nothing to do but to ca&s;t away care, and go on board a man of war, for I could never bear to &s;tay here if you was married to another.</P>
