<P>THE Order of the Day being read, on the motion of Sir Gilbert Elliot, and the Hou&s;e having re&s;olved it&s;elf into a Com|mittee of the whole Hou&s;e, to con&s;ider fur|ther of the Charges again&s;t Sir Elijah Impey, Mr. Wyndham in the Chair.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Francis</HI> ro&s;e and &s;aid: I lament that there is not a fuller attendance, and e&s;pecially am I con|cerned that &s;ome gentlemen are not pre&s;ent who heard Sir Elijah Impey deliver his &s;peech at the bar; in which he thought fit to pa&s;s a cen&s;ure on the conduct of General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf. I will, however, if the Committee will grant me that indulgence, now proceed, ac|cording to my notice on a former day, to an&s;wer the imputation.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">
The con&s;ent of the Committee being &s;ignified to Mr. Francis, he again ro&s;e and &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>MR. WYNDHAM,</P>
<P>I Flattered my&s;elf, Sir, that, when the Hou&s;e thought proper to exclude me from the Committee of Managers, whether that Re&s;olution was meant to be a di&s;charge from a &s;ervice, or a relief from a duty, it would have had this effect, at all events, that from thenceforward I &s;hould be &s;uffered to re|main in a &s;tate of neutrality; and that, as I was deprived of the honour, I &s;hould al&s;o be exempted from the cares and cen&s;ures to which the managers of an impeachment mu&s;t unavoidably &s;ubmit. But much more had I rea&s;on to expect that, after the public declaration, which I made in Parlia|ment almo&s;t two years ago, <HI>that I would never &s;it in judgment upon him, and that I would never give a judicial vote in any cau&s;e, in which Sir Elijah Impey might be a party, unle&s;s I could &s;afely give it for him;</HI> and having avowed that declaration in print, as the mo&s;t public mode of avowal of it, and having al&s;o &s;ince repeatedly declared to my friends, and par|ticularly to the Hon. Baronet near me, (Sir Gilbert Elliot) that I would never directly or indirectly, take a part of any kind in the pro&s;ecution of Sir Elijah Impey, and having &s;trictly adhered to the &s;pirit of tho&s;e declarations, I &s;hould not have been implicated in any &s;hape in the impeachment of that gentleman: Lea&s;t of all did I expect that I &s;hould be accu&s;ed by him of having borne te&s;timony to
<PB N="3" REF="4">
his good conduct, and be compelled by him to an&s;wer, as a criminal, for declarations, which he tells you I have heretofore made in his favour. I do not mean to deny his right of mixing accu&s;ation with defence, if to criminate others be in any de|gree material, or even u&s;eful to his own exculpation. In &s;ome ca&s;es undoubtedly the weapons of attack are the be&s;t, perhaps the only in&s;truments of de|fence. With &s;ome men &s;uch is the only defence that can be made. Whether the u&s;e he has made of this weapon, and the manner in which he has availed him&s;elf of his undi&s;puted right, on this occa&s;ion, be perfectly prudent or not, can only be determined by the event. All I a&s;&s;ert and contend for, is, that <HI>I,</HI> in my turn, may be allowed the &s;ame latitude which <HI>he</HI> has taken, and which I allow him. It is not my direct object this day to crimi|nate him or any man. But it <HI>may</HI> be nece&s;&s;ary to my Defence. It may be unavoidable. Defence and accu&s;ation, in this particular ca&s;e, may be in|&s;eparable. If that &s;hould happen, I de&s;ire it may be remembered, that, be&s;ides the general right which, for my&s;elf, I admit, I &s;tand upon the &s;pecifick u&s;e he him&s;elf has made of it, and fol|low the precedent which he has him&s;elf &s;pecifically &s;et me.</P>
<P>Sir, the &s;ituation in which I have lately &s;tood in this Hou&s;e, has been very painful to me indeed. I have been repeatedly the per&s;onal object of de|bate; the middle pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubject between the action and re-action of the powers of the Hou&s;e: between
<PB N="4" REF="5">
the hammer and the anvio. How irk&s;ome &s;uch a &s;ituation mu&s;t have been, I leave to the &s;en&s;a|tions of tho&s;e who have &s;tood in the &s;ame &s;ituation them&s;elves. Much has been &s;aid of my character, much of my temper. I have, by one learned gen|tleman not now pre&s;ent, (the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls) been accu&s;ed of comparing my&s;elf with him, and and with others of his profe&s;&s;ion. Such a com|pari&s;on I never pre&s;umed to make. Arrogance is one thing, pa&s;&s;ion is another; pa&s;&s;ion I have ever conceived to be an hone&s;t, open, and manly emo|tion of the mind; arrogance on the contrary, I take to be a cold, &s;ettled, and determined rule of conduct, re&s;ulting from illiberal and unwarrantable ideas. I may have made u&s;e of warm or pa&s;&s;ion|ate language perhaps, but I was never guilty of the pre&s;umption and arrogance which has been im|puted to me. I &s;tand up now as the <HI>Defendant</HI> in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: as &s;uch, I hope to be heard patiently, and with a fair and liberal con&s;truction&mdash;that is all I de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The charge brought again&s;t Sir J. Clavering, Col. Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, by Sir Elijah Impey, as I under&s;tand it, amounts to this: (It is his own fault if I do not &s;tate it correctly. I mean to do it fairly.)</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That whereas we had by &s;undry declarations and minutes, both before and after the event, expre&s;&s;ed or &s;trongly intimated our opinion that the pro&s;ecution, trial, and execution of Nunducomar were &s;ounded on
<PB N="5" REF="6">
political motives, and pur&s;ued for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of &s;aving Mr. Ha&s;tings from the effect of that man's evidence, no credit ought to be given to the &s;ame, be|cau&s;e we had, in a few days after the execution, ordered a paper, purporting to be a Petition from Nunducomar again&s;t the Judges, to be burnt, the entries of it to be expunged, and the tran&s;lations to be de&s;troyed; and, becau&s;e he had on that occa&s;ion declared, that we con&s;idered the informations con|tained in it as wholly in&s;upported, and of a libellous nature, and that to &s;end a copy of it to the Judges would be giving it much more weight than it de|&s;erved."</Q></P>
<P>If this be the Charge, I admit all the facts, and deny the conclu&s;ion. If I have omitted any part of the Charge: If I have not &s;tated it in as &s;trong terms again&s;t my&s;elf as it is po&s;&s;ible to be &s;tated, I beg any gentleman who hears me, to correct me. I reque&s;t the Committee to divide the Charge into two parts, and to con&s;ider it: Fir&s;t, as it regards us collectively: Secondly, as it per&s;onally regards General Clavering in particular.</P>
<P>But I entreat the Committee to con&s;ider prelimi|nary, Fir&s;t, how this paper came into Sir Elijah Impey's hands, and in what &s;tate, and with what proof of its authenticity it is now brought before the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>[Here Mr. Francis read an Extract from the Bengal Appendix, p. 585, dated the 16th of Augu&s;t, 1775.]</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
On that day we re&s;olved upon a motion, made by me, that the original &s;hould be burnt, and burnt by the hands of the common hangman; to which Mr. Ha&s;tings repeatedly &s;aid he had no objection; but ob&s;erved, that this would not be enough, as the paper &s;tood on our records, and would that way become public. To remove that objection, I pro|po&s;ed that the entry &s;hould be expunged, and it was agreed that it &s;hould be expunged accord|ingly, and that the tran&s;lations &s;hould be de&s;troyed. The re&s;olution was unanimous. Mr. Ha&s;tings ap|proved of it, and was party to it. On the 28th of Augu&s;t the Judges wrote to us in the following words:</P>

<P>"We &s;hall be much obliged to you, if you will be plea&s;ed to acquaint us, from whom you re|ceived the imperfect information, which appears to have been conveyed to you, on this and other oc|ca&s;ions, of the proceedings of this Board in our &s;ecret department; &s;uch communications cannot regularly be made to you but by the authority of the Board, nor can they be obtained without a breach of tru&s;t in &s;ome of our, officers, which we are per&s;uaded you would not encourage."</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>And this letter is &s;igned by Mr. Ha&s;tings, who knew that he alone had given the information.</P>
<P>It is true he di&s;approved of the draft, but not for the rea&s;on, which he ought to have a&s;&s;igned, and which would have prevented our writing that paragraph; neither can he pretend, that he held him&s;elf bound by the &s;en&s;e of the majority to &s;ign the letter, becau&s;e, upon another occa&s;ion, viz. on the 16th of June, 1775, he po&s;itively refu&s;ed to &s;ign a letter to the Judges, of which he di&s;ap|proved.</P>
<P>Sir Elijah Impey tells you, on another occa&s;ion, that he knew nothing of the contents of the Charges of Nunducomar again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings. <HI>How &s;hould he? They were produced before a Secret Council; they were examined by a Secret Committee, of</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<HI>which all the Members, their Clerks and Secretaries were &s;worn to &s;ecrecy.</HI> Mr. Ha&s;tings neverthele&s;s communicates this paper to him, and through his channel to the other Judges. I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, that he imparted many other parts of our proceedings to him.</P>
<P>Sir Elijah Impey affirms, that although the pa|per was imparted to him, he never &s;aw the minutes till very lately, when he procured a copy of them from the India Hou&s;e. This is very extraordinary, and, indeed, it is incredible, that Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;hould &s;hew him one and not the other; e&s;pecially as it appears, that in the month of January follow|ing, he communicated to him &s;everal other minutes &s;igned by us, in which charges again&s;t him were certainly expre&s;&s;ed, and e&s;pecially as the&s;e very mi|nutes were printed by the Directors, and in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of many people in Bengal, in the cour&s;e of 1776 or 1777, and, I believe, read by every body in Calcutta. I know they were by many. Mr. Ha&s;tings takes upon him not only to communicate the paper, after he had <HI>agreed</HI> that the entry &s;hould be expunged, and the tran&s;lations de&s;troyed, but even alters the tran&s;lations in many parts with his own hand. Who will &s;ay that, a paper, &s;o communicated, &s;o altered, and &s;o produced, de|&s;erves any credit? What is a Secret Commitee? The name &s;ufficiently &s;peaks its character; and in re&s;pect to the Secret Committee of Council in Cal|cutta, not only Mr. Ha&s;tings, and every member was bound by an oath of &s;ecrecy, but the &s;ecretaries
<PB N="9" REF="10">
and clerks, and every one of their officers. Even if there had been no oath, Mr. Ha&s;tings was bound in truth and honour by his own agreement; in my own brea&s;t, I hold &s;uch an agreement to be equally binding with an oath.</P>
<P>The original paper, I have no doubt, contained in&s;inuations again&s;t the Judges, and that tho&s;e in&s;i|nuations being wholly un&s;upported, de&s;erved no weight. That the de&s;cription I gave of it was exact, and that it was a libel upon the whole Court of Ju&s;tice, in the &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e of that word. The que&s;tion is, whether by the&s;e declarations I contradict many others in which I have charged the pro&s;ecution and execution of Nunducomar again&s;t Sir Elijah Impey, as a political mea&s;ure of the mo&s;t atrocious kind. At fir&s;t &s;ight, it is not very likely that we (or any men who were not ab&s;olute ideots) &s;hould enter &s;uch contradictions, on the &s;ame re|cords, and place our&s;elves before the Directors in a pointof view which mu&s;t utterly annihilate their confidence in us.</P>
<P>Let the Committee judge of the following declara|tions made by us before, and after the execution of Nunducomar.</P>

<P>"This idea, however de&s;titute of foundation, is prevalent among&s;t the natives, and will naturally deter them from making di&s;coveries, which may be attended with the &s;ame fatal con&s;equences to them&s;elves.</P>

The petition was brought before us after the man's death. It charged the Judges with having murdered him, for having accu&s;ed Mr. Ha&s;tings, or to that effect. It came before us without a re&s;pon&s;ible accu&s;er, without a witne&s;s to prove, or evidence to &s;upport it; the fabrication of a man, publickly executed for a crime, and con&s;equently no longer capable of proving his allegation. This being the ca&s;e, it was what I called it, a libel, and nothing el&s;e, I called it &s;o then, I call it &s;o &s;till; though I was not then, nor am I now, convinced, that the &s;ub&s;tance of it was untrue.

When the man, who advances a &s;pe|cific charge, declares him&s;elf ready to come for|ward and &s;upport it, and to hazard the con|&s;equences of failing in his proofs, it may &s;till be pre&s;umed that the charge is fal&s;e; but it does not partake of the nature of a libel.

to a man who is here to defend him&s;elf, (and they have been &s;hewn in an eminent degree to Sir Elijah Impey) how much more are they due to a man of great character, who is not here, who is not only ab&s;ent, but dead, and who died in the &s;ervice of his country; not in an honourable, but a mo&s;t odious &s;ervice: not in the field of battle, where his gallant mind would have led him, but in an odious, unprofitable conte&s;t, with men of whom he had the wor&s;t opinion po&s;&s;ible.

<P>After all this pa&s;&s;ed, it is not much to be won|dered at that General Clavering &s;hould re&s;olve not to make any more applications in favour of Nun|ducomar. Gen. Clavering was a &s;trict, rigid man, not as &s;ome thought cruel, but rigid over much even to prudery, as I &s;ometimes told him, in con&s;e|quence of his refu&s;ing even a di&s;h of fruit, and ci|vilities that certainly did not come within the legal prohibition of pre&s;ents; very tender of public re|putation, and particularly fearful of the imputation of &s;upporting and encouraging the accu&s;er of Mr. Ha&s;tings, an imputation, which, he was &s;ure he &s;hould incur and equally &s;ure of doing Nundu|comer no &s;ervice. What he did, was, in truth, a mo&s;t ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate action, namely, the bringing the Petition at all before the Board. The man was dead, and Gen. Clavering made him&s;elf
<PB N="19" REF="20">
the publi&s;her of the libel. He put him&s;elf in the power of his enemies who infallibly would have ruined him. This, let it operate as it may, I de|clare, upon my honour, and I &s;hall, if nece&s;&s;ary, upon my oath, was a &s;trong concurrent motive with Col. Mon&s;on and me, for getting the paper de&s;troy|ed. As Mr. Ha&s;tings entirely agreed with us in every thing we did relative to the paper, I never had a doubt that all the tran&s;lations of it were de&s;troyed, until Sir Elijah Impey produced a copy of it at the Bar of this Hou&s;e. Of the authenticity of which you have no evidence, and which, admitting it to be authentic, mu&s;t have been obtained by means the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable, by means which prove, what we always &s;u&s;pected, that we were betrayed by one of our own Board to Sir Elijah Impey, and by means, which prove to demon&s;tration the collu&s;ion and confederacy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from the fir&s;t, be|tween Sir Elijah Impey and Mr. Ha&s;tings.</P>
<P>I beg the Committee to con&s;ider whether &s;uch facts were not convincing proofs of a confederacy and collu&s;ion exi&s;ting between the Governor-Ge|neral and Sir Elijah Impey; to me they appeared &s;uch, and &s;o I conceive they mu&s;t to every candid man. I he&s;itate not to declare, in the mo&s;t explicit, and in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that the private motive of my &s;tanding &s;o forward as I did for the de&s;truction of the copy and tran&s;lations of the peti|tion &s;ent by Nunducomar, previous to his execu|tion, to General Clavering, was not the public one I a&s;&s;igned, viz. that it was a libel; but my fear for
<PB N="20" REF="21">
the &s;afety of General Clavering: Colonel Mon&s;on and my&s;elf ob&s;erving, that the Judges had gone all length; that they had already dipped their hands in blood for a political purpo&s;e; and that they might again proceed on the &s;ame principle. With re&s;pect to what pa&s;&s;ed relative to Nunducomar's application to be removed from the common gaol of Calcutta, to &s;ome place where he could take &s;u&s;tenance, and perform his ablutions, and other ceremonies, in a manner conformable to his reli|gion, I beg to declare to the Committee, that however ab&s;urd to many, &s;uch opinions as Nundu|comar entertained on that &s;ubject may be con&s;ider|ed, yet I believe, and always did believe, Nundu|comar to be &s;erious in tho&s;e &s;cruples: he gave a &s;trong proof that he was &s;o, by continuing to re|fu&s;e any kind of nouri&s;hment for <HI>&s;iuty</HI> or <HI>&s;eventy</HI> hours together. The manner in which General Clavering's daughters have been treated by Sir Elijah Impey, at the bar of this Hou&s;e, was in the mo&s;t unbecoming, in the mo&s;t unwarrantable man|ner. The conduct of the&s;e ladies had been mo&s;t gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented&mdash;not their &s;ex, their virtue, their youth, their beauty, nor their many accom|pli&s;hments, could re&s;cue them from the mo&s;t illi|beral mi&s;repre&s;entation; a mi&s;repre&s;entation, haz|arded merely for the purpo&s;e of making them, by a fal&s;e and forced con&s;truction of their conduct, to appear as the accu&s;ers of their father. The act they did, was an act of humanity, an act of cha|rity, which, had they been ugly, deformed, loath|&s;ome, or even pro&s;tituted, would have ca&s;t a veil
<PB N="21" REF="22">
over their vile&s;t vices; but that act had been, by Sir Elijah Impey, perverted, and fal&s;ely urged as a proof again&s;t their parent. Tho&s;e ladies vi&s;ited Nunducomar in his confinement, and endeavoured to make his &s;ituation as light as po&s;&s;ible. If &s;uch conduct was a crime in the ladies. I am equally criminal; I vi&s;ited Nunducomar frequently, and &s;hould have con&s;idered my&s;elf devoid of humanity had I done otherwi&s;e. The &s;ufferings of Nundu|comar were great, confined in the common gaol of Calcutta, &s;o mi&s;erable, &s;o horrid a place, that the bare commitment to it was equal to death. Many confined in that pri&s;on had died in con&s;equence of &s;uch confinement, and particularly a Mr. Maynard. Many who hear me know what I a&s;&s;ert to be a fact; let gentlemen then con&s;ider what the unfor|tunate Nunducomar mu&s;t have felt in &s;uch a con|finement; a man e&s;teemed of higher rank in his own country than any of the Council, a man who had been the Prime Mini&s;ter of the country, and was of the highe&s;t ca&s;t of his religion!! It was un|doubtedly true that the Supreme Court &s;ent pundits to Nunducomar to examine into his &s;cruples, and that they declared that he might take &s;u&s;tenance without incurring more than a very &s;light and tri|vial penance; but it &s;hould be con&s;idered what the pundits were; they were men of &s;mall income, and of a lower ca&s;t of religion than Nunducomar, and could not con&s;equently judge of his &s;cruples. Nunducomar him&s;elf told me, that the pundits not being of &s;o high a ca&s;t as him&s;elf, were wholly in|capable of advi&s;ing him, or feeling the &s;ame &s;cru|ples
<PB N="22" REF="23">
that he did. Nunducomar was of the highe&s;t order of the Bramins, and it was therefore mo&s;t probable that what he had a&s;&s;erted was true, e&s;pe|cially as he continued, though upwards of &s;eventy years of age, to refu&s;e all &s;u&s;tenance, till the Judges them&s;elves were alarmed at the idea of a <HI>legal murder,</HI> and cau&s;ed Nunducomar to be removed to a place of confinement more adapted to his being able to perform what his con&s;cience told him his religion required.</P>
<P>I conceive, Sir, the be&s;t evidence that can be brought again&s;t any man, to be that man's own evidence, &s;uch evidence generally makes the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion: I will undertake to &s;atisfy the Com|mittee, that Sir Elijah Impey, when in Bengal, never looked on the tran&s;action, on which he now pretends to place &s;o much reliance, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which he repre&s;ented it at the bar of this Hou&s;e. I will prove that Sir Elijah Impey never did, before his defence at the bar, give that con|&s;truction to the act of General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, of burning the petition of Nunducomar, as he has lately endeavoured to fix upon it, namely, that it amounted not only to a flat contradiction of any opinions we had, or might deliver to the di&s;advantage of the Judges, in that bu&s;ine&s;s, but did expre&s;s and convey a direct and explicit ju&s;tification of their conduct. To prove that this was not the opinion of Sir Elijah Impey, in the year 1775, I beg leave to read &s;everal pa&s;|&s;ages from a letter &s;ent by Sir Elijah Impey to the
<PB N="23" REF="24">
Secretary of State, dated the 20th of January, 1776, written on purpo&s;e to vindicate his character from the a&s;per&s;ions uniformly thrown upon it by General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, for his conduct in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Nunducomar, and to charge us with having con&s;tantly imputed to the Court the mo&s;t atrocious motives for their conduct, by &s;trong in&s;inuation, malignant &s;arca&s;m, and &s;e|vere cen&s;ure; and to accu&s;e us al&s;o of attempting, on &s;undry occa&s;ions, to over-awe, and reduce the authority of the Court.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Extract of a Letter from Sir</HI> ELIJAH IMPEY, <HI>to the Secretary of State.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dated Calcutta, <DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 20, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. The Governor General has, within the&s;e few days, communicated to me &s;everal Minutes, &s;igned by General Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and Mr. Francis. They are &s;everally fraught with direct Charges, or plain in&s;inuations again&s;t the characters of the Judges, and the conduct of the Court of Judicature. Some &s;eem more particularly levelled at <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The crimes either directly charged upon the Judges, or indirectly in&s;inuated, (which, I think we have more rea&s;on to complain of, as being le&s;s liberal) are of &s;o horrid and dete&s;table a nature, that if they are well grounded, ought to &s;ubject each of them to the highe&s;t puni&s;hment a Parliamentary
<PB N="24" REF="25">
Impeachment can inflict, and brand their names with infamy to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P N="3">3. I do &s;incerely attribute the offen&s;ive parts of the paragraphs to immaginations, heated by party di&s;putes; and entertain &s;o high a &s;en&s;e of the ho|nour of the gentlemen, that at a period &s;ome di&s;tance from the events, which &s;hall have given time for their judgments to cool, <HI>they will</HI> them&s;elves be &s;hocked at what they have wrote, and be willing to retract the charges.</P>
<P N="4">4. A publick notification is profe&s;&s;edly made to the Engli&s;h nation, by which it is attempted to per&s;uade them, that the Court of Judicature, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by his Maje&s;ty for protecting the natives of this country, and the Ea&s;t India Company, from the violence and oppre&s;&s;ion of the Company's &s;ervants, has been by the Judges converted into an execrable in&s;trument in the hands of Mr. Ha&s;t|ings, of de&s;troying the innocent native, for the &s;ake of protecting the guilty &s;ervants of the Com|pany.</P>
<P N="5">5. It &s;hould be known, that the conduct of the Council to the Judges, and to the pri&s;oner du|ring his confinement, had rai&s;ed an almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al belief in the natives, and even among the Europeans, that the pri&s;oner would be <HI>protected</HI> from Ju&s;tice, in defiance of the Court.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="25" REF="26">
6. Rajah Gourda&s;s (&s;on of Nunducomar) has cau&s;ed it to be intimated to me, that he was very de&s;irous to pay his re&s;pects to me, but is po&s;&s;itively enjoined (he mu&s;t mean <HI>forbidden)</HI> entering my hou&s;e by members of the Council.</P>
<P>N. B. The majority of the Council in one of their minutes had &s;aid, <HI>we are ignorant of any attempts to overthrow or reduce the outhority of the Supereme Court.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. In an&s;wer to this, I mu&s;t refer to the letters &s;ent me by the Council in May la&s;t, concerning Nunducomar; the letter addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Ju&s;tice Hyde and Ju&s;tice Lemai&s;tre; the <HI>univer&s;al</HI> tenor of the Minutes of the Council, <HI>whenever</HI> the conduct of the Judges made part of their con&s;ultations.</P>

<P>Had Sir Elijah Impey, at the time he wrote that letter, con&s;idered our declaraion that Nun|ducomar's petition was a Libel, and the burning it in con&s;equence thereof, as any proof of our opi|nion in his favor, can it be imagined by any rea&s;onable man that he would not have &s;tated, and urged it for that purpo&s;e in his letter to the Secre|tary of State, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal &s;heets, and was, from beginning to end, a profe&s;&s;ed defence of him&s;elf again&s;t our charges, and a laboured effort to recriminate upon us! In&s;tead of doing &s;o, the fact was not mentioned, or even alluded to, in this voluminous letter&mdash;That was the time, if ever for him to have availed him&s;elf of our evidence again&s;t our&s;elves, and to have invalidated any de|clarations
<PB N="26" REF="27">
we might have made again&s;t him on other occa&s;ions&mdash;His not availing him&s;elf of that op|portunity, warranted a conclu&s;ion the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;t|ible; it proves beyond a doubt that while he was in Bengal, or at lea&s;t, however, when he wrote the letter, that he had not the mo&s;t remote Idea, that our act, on which he now in&s;i&s;ts, could bear the Con&s;truction he now gives it.</P>
<P>But why, Sir, did Sir Elijah Impey declare that he never &s;aw the minutes of the Secret Committee till lately? the rea&s;on is obvious&mdash;becau&s;e, had he admitted that he had &s;een the minutes in Calcutta, as in fact he mu&s;t have done, his letter to the Se|cretary of State, dated Jan. 23, 1775, would have been a manife&s;t fal&s;hood as a charge, and palpa|bly defective as a defence. It would have been fal&s;e upon the face of it, and his an&s;wer to the charge, criminating him on account of the execution of the Nunducomar, would have been mo&s;t unaccountably defective by the omi&s;&s;ion of that, which, if true, and agreeable to his con&s;truction of it, would have been the be&s;t an&s;wer of all, viz. our own acquittal of him by the minutes in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I appeal, Sir, to the judgement of the Committee, and to common &s;en&s;e, whether, by the facts I have &s;tated, I have not fully an&s;wered the accu&s;ation, and cen&s;ure, by Sir Elijah Impev, on Gen. Clavering, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf&mdash;I think I have done &s;o, in a manner that mu&s;t be &s;atisfactory to the feel|ings
<PB N="27" REF="28">
of every gentleman pre&s;ent, and to every hone&s;t man who hears me.</P>
<P>I have been under much difficulty on account of Sir Elijah Impey's having made his imputation oath; I will act a more fair part, I challenge Sir Elijah Impey to put upon paper his charge again&s;t us; if he does &s;o, I pledge my&s;elf to the hou&s;e, and to the world, that I will deliver the defence of Gen. Cla|vering, Col. Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, in writing like|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir, I wi&s;h to make one further ob&s;ervation to the Committee, and that is, to remind them of the extraordinary mode adopted by Mr. Ha&s;tings, and Sir Elijah Impey, when defending them&s;elves at the bar of this hou&s;e, again&s;t charges &s;tated in expre&s;s terms, and in a &s;pecific form&mdash;The very fir&s;t thing tho&s;e men thought nece&s;&s;ary to do, in that &s;ituation, was to mark me as their enemy, they &s;eemed to conceive it e&s;&s;ential to their &s;afety to &s;ingle me out as a per&s;on proper to attack, to calumniate, to di&s;|credit, to di&s;qualify, and to remove.&mdash;I know not how other gentlemen may feel, but I own my&s;elf proud of the di&s;tinction&mdash;I con&s;ider it an honour. I am not the per&s;onal enemy of tho&s;e men, but I hope as long as my name &s;hall exi&s;t, it may be known in oppo&s;ition to theirs, and that my charac|ter, my conduct, and my name, may everla&s;ting remain contra&s;ted, and con&s;idered as in everla&s;ting ho&s;tility with the names, conduct, characters, and hearts, of Mr. Ha&s;tings, and Sir Elijah Impey.</P>
