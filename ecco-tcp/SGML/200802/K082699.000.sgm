<HEAD>SPEECH OF GENERAL BURGOYNE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>MOTION by Mr. VYNER, Martis 26^o die Maii, 1778.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"THAT this hou&s;e will now re&s;olve it|&s;elf into a committee of the whole hou&s;e to con&s;ider of the &s;tate and condition of the army which &s;urrendered them&s;elves on convention at Saratoga, in America; and al&s;o by what means Lieutenant Gene|ral Burgoyne, who commanded that army, and was included in that convention, was relea&s;ed, and is now returned to England?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Vyner, in opening the motion, &s;tated &s;ome que&s;tions to General Burgoyne, which he propo&s;ed to a&s;k in the committee.</P>
<P>The motion was &s;econded by Mr. Wilkes, who al&s;o &s;tated further que&s;tions in re&s;pect to
<PB N="2" REF="5">
the treaty with the Indians, their conduct during the campaign, and the burning the country.</P>
<P>An amendment was propo&s;ed by Mr. Fox to in&s;ert, after the word <HI>con&s;ider,</HI> the&s;e words <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of the tran&s;actions of the northern army under Lieutenant General Burgoyne, and of"</Q></P>
<P>The motion thus amended, would have run as follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That this hou&s;e will now re&s;olve it&s;elf into a committee of the whole hou&s;e to con&s;ider of the tran&s;actions of the northern army under Lieutenant General Burgoyne, and of the &s;tate and condition of the &s;aid army, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the debate General Bur|gopne &s;poke nearly as follows:</P>
<P>Mr. Speaker, not imagining there would be any motion by the honourable gentleman who &s;poke fir&s;t, but that merely a de&s;ire of information would be expre&s;&s;ed upon certain &s;ubjects, I had my&s;elf prepared a motion for an addre&s;s to the king, to have &s;uch papers laid before the hou&s;e, as are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and contain an account in detail, much too long for me to give in my place, of every circum&s;tance expre&s;&s;ed in the que&s;tions of the honourable gentleman. Tho&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="6">
papers are of the utmo&s;t importance to the &s;tate, to parliament, and to the public.</P>
<P>The turn the bu&s;ine&s;s has taken precludes me at pre&s;ent from my intended motion; but I ri&s;e to give my warme&s;t &s;upport to the amendment propo&s;ed; and as rea&s;ons for the expediency of in&s;tituting a full enquiry, to which the amendment points, I &s;hall endea|vour, as far as I can do it without breach of order in debate, to give to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Vyner</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wilkes.</HI></NOTE>both the gentle|men &s;atisfaction upon the particular &s;ubjects of their enquiries.</P>
<P>I agree with the honourable gentleman who &s;econded the motion, that all the conduct re|&s;pecting the Indian nations is a matter that ought to be thoroughly canva&s;&s;ed; and I look upon his calling upon me openly, and in my place, as &s;ome reparation for the very free, and not very generous comments he made upon my conduct in my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Sir, I ever e&s;teemed the Indian alliances, at be&s;t, a nece&s;&s;ary evil. I ever believed their &s;ervices to be over-valued; &s;ometimes in&s;igni|ficant, often barbarous, always capricious; and that the employment of them was only ju&s;tifiable, when by being united to a regular army, they could be kept under controul, and made &s;ub&s;ervient to a general &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">Upon this principle I heartily concurred with that gallant and humane general, Sir Guy Carleton, in the year 1776, to decline the offers and &s;olicitations of the Indians to be then employed &s;eparately: the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of compleating the preparations for pa&s;|&s;ing the regular troops over the lakes made it impo&s;&s;ible to employ them conjunctively.</P>
<P>In that year, Sir, it was my lot, by delega|tion from Sir Guy Carleton, who was then at Quebec, to pre&s;ide at one of the greate&s;t councils with the Indians that had been held at Montreal. Many gentlemen here know, that the ceremony preceding the taking up the hatchet, is, to offer to the repre&s;entative of the power they mean to &s;erve, the pipe of war. It was pre&s;&s;ed upon me by the chiefs pre|&s;ent; and it was in my power, by a &s;ingle whif of tobacco, to have given flame and ex|plo&s;ion to a dozen nations. I never felt greater &s;atisfaction than in being able to ful|fil the in&s;tructions I was charged with, for re&s;training the impetuous pa&s;&s;ions of the&s;e people: it was a &s;econdary &s;atisfaction, at my return to England in the winter, to ju&s;tify the conduct of Sir Guy Carleton in this re&s;pect, though the ju&s;tification was very unpopular, among tho&s;e&mdash;I mean not to particularize
<PB N="5" REF="8">
mini&s;ters, or mini&s;ters of mini&s;ters&mdash;but a|mong tho&s;e men, who, in their zeal again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, had adopted the rea&s;oning, that <Q REND="inline">"partial &s;everity was general mercy,"</Q> pro|vided by carrying terrors it conduced to fini&s;hing the war. How ju&s;t &s;o ever this principle may be, my mind is not of a texture for carrying it into effect; and I returned to Canada the following &s;pring, when I &s;uc|ceeded to the command, determined to be the &s;oldier, not the executioner of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I found care had been already taken by Ge|neral Carleton, upon the &s;ame principles of humanity which always direct his conduct, to officer the Indians with gentlemen &s;elected from the Briti&s;h troops, upon a di&s;tinction of their temper and judgment, as well as upon that of their valour; and in much greater number than ever was de&s;tined to that &s;ervice before. To the&s;e precautions I added that of a favourite prie&s;t, who had more controul o|ver the pa&s;&s;ions of the Indians than all their chiefs put together; and I tru&s;t the expence put upon government to engage that gentle|man's a&s;&s;i&s;tance through the cour&s;e of the campaign, will not be e&s;teemed an improper article in my accounts.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">Sir, with the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances I was able to en|force obedience to the injunctions of my &s;peech at the great council, upon a&s;&s;embling the ar|my, which has been made public. Barbarity was prevented&mdash;So much &s;o, that in one in|&s;tance, two wounded provincial officers were brought off in the mid&s;t of fire upon the backs of Indians; and a captain, and his whole de|tachment, placed in ambu&s;cade, were brought pri&s;oners to my camp by Indians, without a man hurt, though it was evident they were placed for the &s;pecial purpo&s;e of de&s;troying me upon a reconnoitring party, and I was at that time very popular with the Indians.</P>
<P>I could produce many more in&s;tances to &s;hew, that every po&s;&s;ible exertion of humanity was u&s;ed; and that the ca&s;e of Mi&s;s Mecree excepted, which was accident, not premedi|tated cruelty, the &s;tories upon which the ho|nourable gentleman founded his accu&s;ation of me, were merely tho&s;e fabricated by commit|tees, and propagated in news-papers, for tem|porary purpo&s;es. The proclamation, which the honourable gentleman, in my ab&s;ence treated with &s;o har&s;h terms, I avow, was penned by my&s;elf. The de&s;ign was to excite obedience, fir&s;t by encouragement, and next by the dread, not the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;everity;
<PB N="7" REF="10"><Q REND="inline">&mdash;"to &s;peak daggers, but u&s;e none."</Q> And &s;o far were the Americans, in their hearts, from putting upon that proclamation the in|terpretation that gentleman has done, that it &s;erved to procure me re&s;pect and acknowledg|ment wherever I afterwards travelled through the country.</P>
<P>Sir, a gentleman has been in London great part of the winter, who I wi&s;h had been called to your bar.&mdash;It is for the &s;ake of truth only I wi&s;h it; for he is certainly not my friend. His name is St. Luc le Corne, a di&s;tingui&s;hed parti&s;an of the French in the la&s;t war, and now in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice as a leader of the Indians.&mdash;He owes us indeed &s;ome &s;ervice, having been formerly in&s;trumental in &s;calping many hundred Briti&s;h &s;oldiers upon the very ground where, though with a different &s;ort of latitude, he was this year employed. He is by nature, education, and practice, artful, ambitious, and a courtier. To the grudge he owed me for controlling him in the u&s;e of the hatchet and &s;calping knife, it was natural to his character to recommend him&s;elf to mi|ni&s;terial favour, by any cen&s;ure in his power to ca&s;t upon an unfa&s;hionable general. He was often clo&s;eted by a noble Lord in my eye<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>G. Germaine.</HI></NOTE>, and, with all the&s;e di&s;advantages, as he has
<PB N="8" REF="11">
not been examined here, I wi&s;h the noble lord to inform the hou&s;e, what this man has pre|&s;umed to &s;ay of my conduct with the Indians. I know, in private companies, his language has been, that the Indians might have done great &s;ervices, but they were di&s;charged. Sir, if to re&s;train them from murder was to di&s;charge them, I take with pride the blame&mdash;They were di&s;charged. That circum&s;tance apart, I &s;hould &s;ay that the Indians, and Mr. St. Luc at the head of them, de&s;erted.</P>
<P>[<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This part of the &s;peech included between crotchets, was omitted at the time of the preceding and following parts, and delivered &s;eparately upon a &s;econd call of Mr. Wilkes; but now is in&s;erted in its proper place, as better connecting the whole matter &s;poke to by General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Sir, in regard to the call made upon me by the &s;ame honourable gentleman, for expla|nation re&s;pecting the burning of the country during the progre&s;s of the army under my command, I am ignorant of any &s;uch circum|&s;tance; I do not recollect more than one ac|cident by fire; I po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert there was no fire by order or countenance of my&s;elf, or any other officer, except at Saratoga. That di&s;trict is the property of Major General Scuyler of the American troops; there were large barracks built by him, which took fire the day after the army arrived upon the
<PB N="9" REF="12">
ground in their retreat; and I believe I need not &s;tate any other proof of that matter being merely accident, than that the barracks were then made u&s;e of as my ho&s;pital, and full of &s;ick and wounded &s;oldiers. General Scuyler had likewi&s;e a very good dwelling-hou&s;e, exceed|ing large &s;torehou&s;es, great &s;aw-mills, and other out-buildings, to the value altogether perhaps of ten thou&s;and pounds; a few days before the negotiation with General Gates, the enemy had formed a plan to attack me; a large column of troops were approaching to pa&s;s the &s;mall river, preparatory to a general action, and were entirely covered from the fire of my artillery by tho&s;e buildings. Sir, I avow that I gave the order to &s;et them on fire; and in a very &s;hort time that whole pro|perty, I have de&s;cribed, was con&s;umed. But, to &s;hew that the per&s;on mo&s;t deeply con|cerned in that calamity, did not put the con|&s;truction upon it, which it has plea&s;ed the honourable gentleman to do, I mu&s;t in|form the hou&s;e, that one of the fir&s;t per|&s;ons I &s;aw, after the convention was &s;igned, was General Scuyler. I expre&s;&s;ed to him my regret at the event which had happen|ed, and the rea&s;ons which had occa&s;ioned it. He de&s;ired me to think no more of it;
<PB N="10" REF="13">
&s;aid that the occa&s;ion ju&s;tified it, according to the principles and rules of war, and he &s;hould have done the &s;ame upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion, or words to that effect. He did more&mdash;He &s;ent an aid-de-camp to conduct me to Albany, in order, as he expre&s;&s;ed, to procure me better quarters than a &s;tranger might be able to find. This gentleman conducted me to a very ele|gant hou&s;e, and to my great &s;urpri&s;e, pre|&s;ented me to Mrs. Scuyler and her family; and in this general's hou&s;e I remained during my whole &s;tay at Albany, with a table of more than twenty covers for me and my friends, and every other po&s;&s;ible demon&s;tration of ho|&s;pitality: a &s;ituation, painful it is true in point of &s;en&s;ibility at the time, but which I now contemplate with &s;ome &s;atisfaction, as carrying undeniable te&s;timony how little I de&s;erved the charges of the honourable gen|tleman; and I leave it to his feelings, whether, after this explanation, &s;ome farther apology is not due to me.]</P>
<P>In regard to the fir&s;t and mo&s;t material que&s;tion a&s;ked me by the honourable gentle|man who propo&s;ed the motion, viz. In what &s;ituation is the army at Cambridge? It is with &s;ome &s;urprize I find that any part of this country is ignorant of the extraordinary cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="11" REF="14">
that have attended it, as I conceive government mu&s;t have received intelligence of them &s;ome time ago. In regard to the re|port made by my&s;elf, I acquit the king's mi|ni&s;ters of any blame in not yet having made it public, becau&s;e it was &s;o voluminous that the papers could not be dige&s;ted and copied, with the con&s;tant labour of three clerks, before la&s;t Saturday, when they were put into the hands of the noble lord &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the American department. But I tru&s;t that noble lord will now lo&s;e no time to make pu|blic, matters of &s;uch importance. Let them undergo the &s;crutiny of the committee as pro|po&s;ed by the amended motion, and let the world judge, upon their report, whether the &s;pirit of the troops and the honour of the na|tion have been &s;u&s;tained and vindicated during tho&s;e tran&s;actions. In confidence that the&s;e papers cannot po&s;&s;ibly be withheld, I refer the honourable gentleman to them for a full delineation and explanation of the &s;tate of things at Cambridge, and will re&s;t my pre&s;ent information upon a few material facts. The troops have undergone hard&s;hips and trials of patience as &s;evere, though of a different nature, as any they experienced in the conflicts of the campaign. They have acquitted them&s;elves
<PB N="12" REF="15">
with equal re&s;olution, temper, and honour. They are at pre&s;ent detained by a re&s;olve of the congre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing that there are cau|&s;es of &s;u&s;picion that the convention was de|&s;igned to be broke on our part, and therefore they are ju&s;tifiable, without breach of public faith, to &s;u&s;pend the embarkation of the troops till the convention is ratified by the court of Great Britain.</P>
<P>In common with various pretences which involved other names in high departments to ju&s;tify this mea&s;ure, the congre&s;s grounded many &s;uppo&s;itions that I knew to be unju&s;t, upon my conduct. I thought it a duty to the &s;tate, to the army, and to my&s;elf, to refute tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, and &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible, to give im|mediate effect to the convention. It will re&s;t upon the hou&s;e to judge, when they &s;ee the papers, whether I made good that refutation. And that brings me to another que&s;tion a&s;ked by the honourable gentleman: <Q REND="inline">"By what means and upon what condition I am in per&s;on here?"</Q> Sir, I charged my aid de camp, who carried my di&s;patch to the congre&s;s in an&s;wer to their vote of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, which the pre&s;ident had officially &s;ent me, with a &s;econd letter to be delivered in ca&s;e the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, after con&s;ide|ration had of my fir&s;t letter, was continued:
<PB N="13" REF="16">
The purport of this letter was to a&s;k pa&s;&s;ports for my per&s;onal return for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my health, (which was then much affected) for the purpo&s;e of &s;ettling large and complicated accounts, and other rea&s;ons; and I offered to give a parole that &s;hould the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of embarka|tion be prolonged beyond the time apprehended, I would return to America upon demand of the congre&s;s, and due notice given, re-deliver my per&s;on into their hands, and abide the fate of the re&s;t of the army with whom I had &s;erved. Sir, I had many rea&s;ons, not nece&s;ary nor pro|per to be alleged to the congre&s;s, founded upon a nearer intere&s;t than health or any pri|vate expediency, to make me de&s;irous to return home: to lay before government important truths, not to be communicated by other means, and to &s;upply, as far as in me lay, by an a&s;&s;iduous and hone&s;t exertion in this hou&s;e, the misfortune that had di&s;enabled me from performing my duty in the field. I accompa|nied my letter to the congre&s;s by one to Gene|ral Wa&s;hington, wherein upon an opinion of his character, I a&s;ked him for his &s;upport to an application that could not interfere with the public duties of our re&s;pective &s;ituations. I &s;hall beg leave to read his an&s;wer as part of my &s;peech; and I do it, Sir, not only le&s;t in
<PB N="14" REF="17">
the&s;e times of doubt and a&s;per&s;ion, I &s;hould incur cen&s;ure for holding private corre&s;pon|dence with an enemy, but likewi&s;e becau&s;e I think this letter, though from an enemy, does honour to the human heart.</P>
<P>[<HI>See the Appendix.</HI>]</P>
<P>Sir, the congre&s;s readily con&s;ented to my application; and by this candid treatment of my enemies, I am here to vindicate my conduct again&s;t the fal&s;e and barbarous inter|pretations that have ari&s;en and have been &s;uf|fered to prevail, by tho&s;e who could have con|tradicted them, at home.</P>
<P>The honourable gentleman wi&s;hes to know what is the difference of numbers of the army between the time of &s;igning the convention, and the pre&s;ent time; and I find the idea of great de&s;ertion very much prevails. That &s;ome men have de&s;erted, in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, is true. They are few, the &s;cum of the regiments, and no lo&s;s of real &s;trength. The greater part who have ab&s;conded, have had no intention to abandon the &s;ervice, and if an epithet of honour could at any time be applied to a fault, theirs might be called <HI>an honourable de&s;ertion.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Burgoyne took occa&s;ion in two &s;ub&s;equent debates to explain his meaning in this phra&s;e, which he found had been mi&s;under&s;tood both within and without the hou&s;e. He meant to apply the word <HI>honourable</HI> only to the common &s;oldier's conception, who unu&s;ed to con&s;ider and di&s;criminate punctili|ou&s;ly the obligations of conventions with an enemy, acted only upon the principles of zeal to &s;erve his king, and again to be actively employed in arms: that therefore their conduct was honourably intended, though mi&s;conceived. That &s;o far from ju&s;tifying that conception him&s;elf, he was per&s;uaded that to re|tain &s;uch de&s;erters when demanded, or indeed di&s;covered, would be an infringement of the convention, and he was per&s;uaded Sir William Howe or Sir Henry Clinton would, upon &s;uch de|mand or di&s;covery, return them.</NOTE> Some of
<PB N="15" REF="18">
the&s;e men left letters or &s;ent me&s;&s;ages to their officers, informing them that in their pre&s;ent want of nece&s;&s;aries and comforts, and their inability to &s;erve in arms, they had taken to trades and day labour in the country, but that they held them&s;elves under an obligation from which they would never depart, to return to their regiments whenever the time of embar|kation was a&s;certained: others, upon a high, though a mi&s;taken &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;pirit, made efforts to effectuate a pa&s;&s;age through the woods, to join the armies under Sir William Howe or Sir Henry Clinton, and it is believed that &s;ome of them &s;ucceeded. The whole of the ab&s;entees may amount to between five and &s;ix hundred men.</P>
<P>Sir, I have thus far endeavoured to give the honourable gentlemen &s;atisfaction in the matters that &s;eem mo&s;t immediately to engage their attention, and that I could con&s;i&s;tently
<PB N="16" REF="19">
with order adduce in argument to &s;upport my vote for a more general enquiry.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed, (as yet &s;tronger rea&s;ons for agreeing with the amendment,) to take notice of what has hitherto pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e, and upon very imperfect information, re&s;pecting other parts of the late campaign.</P>
<P>But, Sir, accu&s;tomed as I have been to be indulged by the hou&s;e upon every occa&s;ion; and confident, as I ought to be, upon one where their indulgence is ju&s;tice, I find cau&s;e in my own mind, in entering upon &s;o compli|cated a &s;ubject, to implore anew, the fulle&s;t &s;cope to their patience and candour, for a man, who&s;e faculties, far too weak for &s;uch &s;hocks, are almo&s;t unhinged by a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of difficulties abroad, that fall to the lot of few, and who&s;e di&s;appointments and anxieties have been con&s;ummated, by the un|expected reception he has met at home.</P>
<P>And this addre&s;s, Sir, is the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e I &s;tand here unconnected and una&s;&s;i&s;ted. I am ignorant who would have &s;upported my own motion, had I made it, though confident from a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its propriety it would have found a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;omewhere. Neither courting nor fearing power, neither courting nor fearing party, I &s;tand here upon the &s;ole
<PB N="17" REF="20">
ba&s;is of truth and honour, and only a&s;k &s;upport in proportion to the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e.</P>
<P>During my ab&s;ence an enquiry was in&s;ti|tuted, in which my name was very much in|volved. In the &s;hort &s;pace of time &s;ince my return, and in the agitated &s;tate of mind I have mentioned, it has been impo&s;&s;ible for me to obtain from the mere conver&s;ation and re|collection of friends, all that pa&s;&s;ed upon that occa&s;ion: but I have collected enough to know that I have been treated with great atten|tion in general, and it is among my fir&s;t duties to return to every quarter of the hou&s;e my very &s;incere and grateful acknowledg|ments. I al&s;o know, that with all that atten|tion and favour, much implied cen&s;ure mu&s;t have fallen upon me, from the nature of the proceedings, and more e&s;pecially from the po|&s;ition, which I cannot admit to be a true one, but which I under&s;tand has been much in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ted upon, <Q REND="inline">"That where there is mi&s;carriage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">here mu&s;t be blame; and con&s;equently, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he acquittal of one man infers the condemna|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">on of another."</Q></P>
<P>Sir, the papers which have been laid before the Hou&s;e are in &s;ome re&s;pects deficient and in others &s;uperfluous. The fir&s;t &s;uperfluity to which I allude is a private letter from me to
<PB N="18" REF="21">

<P>Not conceiving for what po&s;&s;ible public purpo&s;e this letter was produced, I can only attend to the effects it has had to prejudice me per&s;onally. Su&s;picions have been excited, that at the time I wrote that letter I was court|ing command, and by adulatory means, in preference and in prejudice to Sir Guy Carleton under whom I had had the honour to &s;erve, a confidential &s;econd, the preceding campaign. Every per&s;on in government might have pro|nounced my acquittal of &s;o ba&s;e a proceeding, becau&s;e they knew, though the public did not, that it was decided<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This deci&s;ion was made, not only upon the expediency of the governor attending the civil duties of the province, which were thought at that time to require particular attention, but al&s;o upon doubts whether the general's commi&s;&s;ion authori&s;ed him to act beyond the boundaries: and this whole tran&s;action pa&s;&s;ed long before the return of General Burgoyne to England, and entirely without his knowledge.</NOTE> in the Autumn of 1776,

and notified to Sir Guy Carleton accordingly, that his military command was confined to the boundaries of the province of Quebec. It did not occur to the noble Lord to &s;tate that fact, becau&s;e doubtle&s;s he did not fore&s;ee the preju|dices the letter would occa&s;ion; but I cannot but lament he did not produce other letters of mine, which would have removed effectually every po&s;&s;ible &s;u&s;picion of a de&s;ign &s;o foreign to my heart as that of &s;upplanting a gallant friend. Such letters would at the &s;ame time have rendered unnece&s;&s;ary the long train of corre&s;pondence laid upon your table, to &s;hew that the preparations in Canada were duly ex|pedited; becau&s;e I &s;hould have been found to expre&s;s the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the zeal, the a&s;&s;idu|ity, and the honour with which Sir Guy Carle|ton acted, notwith&s;tanding his di&s;appointment in not being employed to conduct the cam|paign.</P>
<P>Will it be &s;aid, that the letters I allude to were withheld becau&s;e they were private?&mdash;In the fir&s;t place they do not properly come under that de&s;cription, though it is true they were not office letters.&mdash;They could not be directed as &s;uch, becau&s;e acting in &s;ubordina|tion to Sir Guy Carleton, the official corre|&s;pondence could only with decorum pa&s;s

through him; but they were not private as ap|plied to &s;ecre&s;y, nor improper as they related to the di&s;tinct and &s;eparate object of the com|mand I was entering upon. But, Sir, had any parts of the&s;e letters (or of any others ne|ce&s;&s;ary to my ju&s;tification, of which I &s;ay there are many) been private in any &s;en&s;e of the word, will that excu&s;e be alleged for detaining them, when there has appeared before you a paper of the mo&s;t &s;ecret nature, I mean my thoughts upon conducting the war from the &s;ide of Canada. What officer will venture hereafter to give his opinion upon mea&s;ures or men, when called upon by a mini&s;ter, if his confidence, his rea&s;onings, and his preferences are thus to be invidiou&s;ly expo&s;ed; to create jealou&s;ies and differences among his fellow-officers, and at la&s;t to put an impo&s;ition upon the world, and make him re&s;pon&s;ible for the plan as well as the execution of a hazardous campaign? The plan, as originally drawn, I have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of, becau&s;e it underwent the in&s;pection, and had the &s;anction of &s;ome of the fir&s;t and able&s;t officers of this country; but the plan, as it &s;tood when my orders were framed, can with no more pro|priety be called mine, than any others formed by the cabinet for the di&s;tant parts of America,
<PB N="21" REF="24">
or any other quarter of the globe where I had no participation or concern.&mdash;The noble Lord well knows, that the idea expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ecret paper laid before you of a latitude to act again&s;t New-England, was era&s;ed; that a power to embark the troops in ca&s;e of unfore|&s;een impediments, and make the junction with the &s;outhern army by &s;ea, was not admitted.&mdash;Will it then be in&s;inuated, that the plan was mine?&mdash;Why was it not produced in that changed and garbled &s;tate, by which the mi|ni&s;ter made it his own? Becau&s;e it would have been one proof, if one had been wanting to unprejudiced minds, that by cutting off every propo&s;ed latitude, and confining the plan to one only object, the <HI>forcing</HI> a pa&s;&s;age to Al|bany, the orders framed upon that plan could be no otherwi&s;e under&s;tood, than as po&s;itive, peremptory, and indi&s;pen&s;ible. But, Sir, it has been boldly in&s;inuated, and perhaps even credited by &s;ome in this hou&s;e, that the words at the latter end of the orders, which are called the &s;aving clau&s;e, were &s;pecially dic|tated by me.&mdash;Sir, to &s;uppo&s;e that, is to &s;up|po&s;e me an ideot!&mdash;Saving clau&s;e&mdash;to whom?

<PB N="23" REF="26">
general could dictate &s;uch a dilemma for him|&s;elf is prepo&s;terous. To believe that mini|&s;ters could mean it, is &s;evere credulity again&s;t them; it would be to believe them capable of the equivocation of a fiend, to in&s;ure the ruin of tho&s;e who acted under their direction whatever part they &s;hould take. I charge them not &s;o heavily. I am per&s;uaded that &s;aving clau&s;e was meant when it was penned, as it has been under&s;tood by me, by Sir William Howe, and by every other per&s;on who has read it, as referring &s;olely to exigencies after the arrival of my army at Albany.</P>
<P>But, Sir, this ideal blame in not availing my&s;elf of the <HI>&s;aving clau&s;e,</HI> has been &s;upported by a &s;tory, that I &s;hould hardly have believed it within malevolence to invent, but which I find has been propagated with great indu&s;try, viz. that Generals Philips and Frazer remon|&s;trated again&s;t the pa&s;&s;age of the Hud&s;on's River; and that finding their remon&s;trances of no avail, they took the parts of brave men in de&s;pair, and per&s;evered in their duty again&s;t their rea&s;on. Upon the honor of a gentleman, without any &s;aving or re&s;ervation &s;oever, I pronounce that report to be a direct and abominable fal&s;ehood. Sir, tho&s;e officers were the eyes and the hands by which I con|ducted
<PB N="24" REF="27">
all material operations: more able ad|vi&s;ers, or more faithful friends, never exi&s;ted&punc; that they &s;aw I was placed in an arduous &s;itu+ation, and felt for my difficulties, it is true; but that they ever dropt a &s;yllable that implied an idea that I had an alternative, I flatly deny. The indefatigable alacrity of General Philips to bring forward the tran&s;ports preparatory to the pa&s;&s;age of the river, was uncommon even in &s;upport of a favourite object; it would have been uncommon indeed, had he acted with &s;ecret reluctancy! As to General Fra|zer, our communications were tho&s;e of the mo&s;t unre&s;erved friend&s;hip; and it is my pride to affirm, that the con&s;onancy of his &s;enti|ments with mine were almo&s;t invariable. Upon the pa&s;&s;age of the Hud&s;on's River, in particu|lar, he thought it of uncontrovertible ex|pediency; he thought it glorious danger; he was con&s;ulted upon all mea&s;ures at the time and &s;ub&s;equent to it; he bore an active part in many; he approved of all; and the la&s;t &s;entence he uttered, was a me&s;&s;age of affection and good wi&s;hes to me.</P>
<P>The other fal&s;ehoods that have been di&s;|per&s;ed re&s;pecting the &s;ame period of time, can hardly be urged as rea&s;ons for enquiry, for they are below refutation; &s;uch as the delays
<PB N="25" REF="28">
occa&s;ioned by carrying forward <HI>all</HI> the artil|lery, and a cumberous train of baggage&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was a merit of Ea&s;tern pomp,"</Q> &s;ays a mi|ni&s;terial news-writer. That <HI>all</HI> the artillery was with the army is fal&s;e, for the heavy train was &s;ent back to Canada: the field-train which remained was that which had been de&s;tined for the expedition, when Sir Guy Carleton ex|pected to have the conduct of it in per&s;on. That intelligent and judicious officer, General Philips, had been con&s;ulted upon the propor|tion; and it had been regulated upon the con|&s;ideration of the nature of the war; the power of that arm in forcing po&s;ts, and again&s;t new troops; and the probability of having po&s;ts our&s;elves to fortify. Neither, Sir, was the artillery, in the proportion carried, cau&s;e of the lea&s;t delay; becau&s;e the hor&s;es that drew it were &s;upernumerary to tho&s;e which were &s;ufficient for all the carts and waggons we had; and con&s;equently within the time indi&s;pen&s;ibly given for the tran&s;port of the provi&s;ion, the artillery was brought forward by hor&s;es that could have been no otherways employed.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed quantity of baggage is equally erroneous. I cannot &s;uffer an idea &s;o unju&s;t, to the &s;pirit of the army, to remain upon the
<PB N="26" REF="29">
minds of the public. All baggage of bulk, to the abridgment of many material comforts, had been chearfully left behind by the officers; &s;ome of them had not beds; many lay in &s;oldier's tents; and I know of none that had more then the common nece&s;&s;aries for active &s;ervice.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be total want of knowledge of the country and the war, to &s;uppo&s;e that, with all the&s;e precautions, the train of carriages did not &s;till remain great. It is to be con|&s;idered, there was a train of &s;ix hundred car|riages; and tho&s;e too few for the indi&s;pen&s;ible purpo&s;e of tran&s;porting provi&s;ion, where there was no water carriage; there was another train of very cumberous carriages, equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the tran&s;port of the boats, where the rapids prevented their pa&s;&s;age in the &s;tream; a tran&s;port, in &s;ome place, of many miles in in length. Sir, it would be trifling with the hou&s;e to dwell longer upon the&s;e cen&s;ures, the offspring of malice and ignorance; the preva|lence of &s;uch reports tends to one u&s;e&mdash;It will per&s;uade the world, at lea&s;t, that material faults could not abound, when detraction it&s;elf is reduced to have recour&s;e to &s;uch accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>Sir, reverting therefore to the more gro&s;s injuries my reputation has &s;u&s;tained, I think I
<PB N="27" REF="30">
have &s;tated enough to &s;hew, that the cha|racter of a member has been unavoidably brought into que&s;tion, and upon his a&s;&s;ertion that the information the Hou&s;e has proceeded upon, is incomplete and fallacious, I know not what de&s;cription of men could ju&s;tly refu&s;e to him per&s;onally a new and full enquiry.</P>
<P>I would a&s;k of mini&s;ters them&s;elves, what would be their feelings, if, after an un&s;ucce&s;sful undertaking of high tru&s;t and importance, and debarred, by an interdiction, from the pre&s;ence of their Sovereign, the means of &s;ubmitting their conduct to that royal brea&s;t, where ju|&s;tice, and benevolence, and protection to the innocent are ever to be expected, except when truth is perverted or concealed&mdash;what would be their feelings if refu&s;ed al&s;o an appeal to their country? To my brother-officers in par|liament I would more particularly apply for &s;upport to this amendment, as a common cau&s;e of the profe&s;&s;ion: they will con&s;ider the di&s;|couragement that mu&s;t en&s;ue, and the injury the &s;ervice mu&s;t &s;uffer, if an officer, who is con&s;cious to have done his be&s;t, who&s;e greate&s;t enemies pretend not to impute to him any other charges than exce&s;s of zeal and erro|neous judgment, and even the&s;e charges founded upon a mutilated &s;tate of facts&mdash;
<PB N="28" REF="31">
What is the &s;tate of officers, if upon &s;uch grounds, and by the artful management of other circum&s;tances, they are di&s;graced at court, put by, if not inevitably precluded the judg|ment of a military tribunal, and at la&s;t denied the only po&s;&s;ible means of ju&s;tification that re|mains&mdash;a parliamentary inve&s;tigation of a mea&s;ure of &s;tate with which the rectitude or criminality of their conduct is in&s;eparably blended? To my honourable friends who made the original motion early in the winter, and all who took part in it, I may yet more &s;trenuou&s;ly addre&s;s my&s;elf, to repair, by the pa&s;&s;ing this que&s;tion and amendment, the in|jury that unintentionally they brought upon me by the then confined mode of proceeding. To all the&s;e con&s;iderations, Sir, I could join, were it expedient, many more per&s;ua&s;ive calls upon the human heart, to take up this pro|ceeding for the &s;ake of an injured individual: but I wave an appeal to private &s;entiments, and de&s;ire the motion to be con&s;idered as a call upon the public duty of the hou&s;e; and, di|ve&s;ting my&s;elf, as far as po&s;&s;ible, of every per|&s;onal motive; &s;corning the pitiful contention, for &s;uch comparatively it would be, whether the mini&s;ter &s;hould exonerate him&s;elf from <HI>this</HI> error in his in&s;truction, or the general
<PB N="29" REF="32">
from <HI>that</HI> in his execution; I here in my place as a repre&s;entative of the nation, require and demand a full and impartial enquiry into the cau&s;es of the mi&s;carriage of the northern army in an expedition from Canada.</P>
<P>It is a great national object. The cri&s;is of the time emphatically requires it. The ex|i&s;tence of the Briti&s;h empire depends upon the exertions of the military, and the be&s;t foun|dation for public &s;pirit, is public ju&s;tice. In addition to the natural animation which as Britons the army po&s;&s;e&s;s, place before their eyes that &s;econdary &s;pring and controller of human actions, reward and puni&s;hment. Let the fir&s;t and mo&s;t glorious reward, the hone&s;t applau&s;e of the country be obtained by a &s;crutiny into truth for tho&s;e who de&s;erve it: on the contrary, if there has been delinquency, let the &s;pirit of Manlius pre&s;ide in the puni&s;hment.<Q><L>" The hand of fate is over us, and heaven</L>

<P>If there has been di&s;obedience; if unautho|ri&s;ed by circum&s;tances, if <HI>uncompelled by orders</HI> (for I will never &s;hrink from that plea) a ge|neral has ra&s;hly advanced upon the enemy, and engaged again&s;t in&s;urmountable odds, the di&s;cipline of the &s;tate &s;hould &s;trike, though it were a favourite &s;on.<Q><PB N="30" REF="33">" <HI>I, Lictor, deliga ad palum.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are the means to excite true ambition in your leaders, the&s;e are the means to keep them in due re&s;traint; this was the &s;y&s;tem of the glorious patriot,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Chatham.</HI></NOTE> who&s;e ob&s;equies you now celebrate, and could his a&s;hes awaken, they would bur&s;t their cearments to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>As for my&s;elf, if I am guilty, I fear I am deeply guilty: an army lo&s;t! the &s;anguine ex|pectation of the kingdom di&s;appointed! a fo|reign war cau&s;ed, or the commencement of it accelerated! an effu&s;ion of as brave blood as ever run in Briti&s;h veins &s;hed, and the &s;evere&s;t family di&s;tre&s;&s;es combined with public calami|ty.&mdash;If this ma&s;s of mi&s;eries be indeed the con|&s;equence of my mi&s;conduct, vain will be the extenuation I can plead of my per&s;onal &s;uffer|ings, fatigue and hard&s;hip, laborious days and &s;leeple&s;s nights, ill health and trying &s;ituations; poor and in&s;ufficient will be &s;uch atonement in the judgment of my country, or perhaps in the eyes of God&mdash;yet with this dreadful alter|native in view, I provoke a trial&mdash;Give me inquiry&mdash;I put the intere&s;ts that hang mo&s;t emphatically by the heart-&s;trings of man&mdash;my fortune&mdash;my honour&mdash;my head&mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid my &s;alvation, upon the te&s;t.</P>
<P>But, Sir, it is con&s;olation to me to think
<PB N="31" REF="34">
that I &s;hall be, even in &s;urmi&s;e, the only culprit&mdash;Whatever fate may attend the gene|ral who led the army to Saratoga, their beha|viour at that memorable &s;pot mu&s;t entitle them to the thanks of their country&mdash;Sir, it was a calamitous, it was an awful, but it was an honourable hour&mdash;During the &s;u&s;pence of the an&s;wer from the general of the enemy, to the refu&s;al made by me of complying with the ignominious conditions he had propo&s;ed, the countenance of the troops beggars de&s;cription&mdash;a patient fortitude; a &s;ort of &s;tern re|&s;ignation, that no pencil or language can reach, &s;at on every brow. I am confident every brea&s;t was prepared to devote its la&s;t drop of blood rather than &s;uffer a precedent to &s;tand upon the Briti&s;h annals of an ignoble &s;urrender.</P>
<P>Sir, an important &s;ubject of enquiry, as I mentioned at my out-&s;et, &s;till remains&mdash;the tran&s;actions at Cambridge, and the cau&s;e of the detention of the troops. If I there have been guilty, let me there al&s;o be the only &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>Sir, there is a famous &s;tory in antient hi|&s;tory, that bears &s;ome analogy to my circum|&s;tances; and when allu&s;ions tend to excite men's minds to exertions of virtue or policy, I &s;hall never think them pedantic or mi&s;pla|ced.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It had been mentioned in a former debate, that references to ancient hi&s;tory carried &s;ometimes an air of pedantry and were &s;eldom of u&s;e.</NOTE>

The event I mean happened in an age when Roman virtue was at its height. It was that wherein Manlius devoted his &s;on and the fir&s;t Decius devoted him&s;elf. A Roman army, &s;hut up by the Samnites at Candium, were obliged to &s;urrender their arms, and to &s;ubmit to the more ignominious condition of pa&s;&s;ing under the yoke of the enemy. The con&s;ul who had commanded them, propo&s;ed in the &s;enate, to break the treaty whereby the army was lo&s;t to the &s;tate, and to make him in per&s;on the expiation, by &s;ending him bound to the enemy to &s;uffer death at their hands. In one point of view the pre&s;ent ca&s;e extremely differs from the example, be|cau&s;e by the treaty at Saratoga the army was &s;aved to the &s;tate. It is the non-compliance with public faith that alone can lo&s;e it&mdash;and here the parallel will hold; if I have been in|&s;trumental to the lo&s;s of tho&s;e brave troops <HI>&s;ince</HI> the treaty, I am as culpable as if I had lo&s;t them <HI>by</HI> the treaty, and ought to be the &s;acrifice to redeem them. Sir, this reference may appear vain-glorious. It may be doubt|ed whether there exi&s;ts in the&s;e times public
<PB N="33" REF="36">
&s;pirit &s;eriou&s;ly to emulate &s;uch examples. I perhaps &s;hould find my&s;elf unequal; but others, who are mo&s;t ready to judge me &s;o, mu&s;t at lea&s;t give credit to one motive for &s;tating the parallel&mdash;that I am too con&s;cious of innocence to apprehend there is the lea&s;t ri&s;k of being expo&s;ed to the trial.</P>
<P>Sir, I have only to return my &s;incere&s;t thanks to the hou&s;e for the patience with which they have endured &s;o long a tre&s;pa&s;s upon their time, and to join my hearty con|currence with the other gentlemen who have &s;poken in favour of the amendment.</P>

Is there a man of common &s;en&s;e and common &s;pirit in the country, that does not &s;tand confounded and agha&s;t at the late &s;upinene&s;s? that does not think the heralds ought to have accompanied your coach, Sir, when you carried up the addre&s;s of the commons; and that the declaration of war at St. James's gate &s;hould have accom|panied
<PB N="37" REF="40">
the an&s;wer from the throne? <Q REND="inline">"Be pa|tient," we are told; "France may repent; Spain yet &s;peaks us fair,"&mdash;</Q>Sir, to be patient in our &s;ituation is to be abject: our pu&s;illani|mity gives tenfold encrea&s;e to our natural weakne&s;s. Patience in private life, under af|fliction or di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;trokes of fortune, or the hand of heaven, is a virtue of lovely hue; but political enduring&mdash;tamely to &s;uffer pro|vocation and injury,&mdash;the mo&s;t wanton in|&s;ult that ever was offered to a nation,&mdash;I mean the me&s;&s;age of the French amba&s;&s;ador:
<Q><L>&mdash;Turn thy complexion there,</L>
<L>Patience, thou young and ro&s;e-lipp'd cherubin,</L>
<L>And there look grim as hell.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>It will be difficult to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t conver&s;ant in hi&s;tory, and accurate in ob&s;erva|tion, to point out examples, where, after an alarm, the &s;pirits of men have revived by in|action. This nation is put into the &s;tate of a garri&s;on, who&s;e out-po&s;ts are abandoned, who&s;e &s;allies are &s;topt, and who are to combat in the body of the place for their la&s;t &s;take. I do not &s;ay, that men have not fought de&s;perate|ly in &s;uch &s;ituations; but then they have been, brought to extremity by a progre&s;&s;ion of con|flicts, and have &s;een great examples to rai&s;e and
<PB N="38" REF="41">
&s;timulate their public pa&s;&s;ions. I know of no great exertions, where the governing coun&s;els have &s;hewn apprehen&s;ion and terror, and confe|quent confu&s;ion at the out&s;et. The &s;ucce&s;s of vigorous mea&s;ures to re&s;tore an army after a panic, is almo&s;t invariable; ancient hi&s;tory abounds with examples; in our own time, they are frequent. When General Roman|zoff found the Ru&s;&s;ians impre&s;&s;ed with appre|hen&s;ions of the Turki&s;h cavalry, his fir&s;t mea|&s;ure was to lay a&s;ide the u&s;e of chevaux de frize, and to encamp without entrenchments. The revival of the general &s;pirit of a &s;tate de|pends upon the &s;ame principles. We need not look abroad for examples; we have a more &s;triking one at home than foreign annals can produce, in that immortal year, 1756, the commencement of the Earl of Chatham's ad|mini&s;tration. The mo&s;t glorious tribute we can pay to his memory, is to follow his ex|ample. Let mini&s;ters vi&s;it his remains, while yet above ground, and catch wi&s;dom, and vi|gour, and virtue from the view. Did he keep fleets at Spithead to prevent inva&s;ion? Did he fear to tru&s;t the internal defence of the nation to her own &s;ons? No, Sir, your navy was employed in offen&s;ive operation in every quar|ter of the globe; and the nation, &s;upported by
<PB N="39" REF="42">
a ju&s;t confidence, were ten times &s;tronger after the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the Hanoverians and He&s;|fians than before. Every &s;hip became a fleet, every regiment felt it&s;elf an ho&s;t.</P>
<P>We have now a brave admiral riding at Spithead, who knows the way to prevent in|va&s;ion by &s;eeking the enemy at a di&s;tance. His &s;hare of glory in the defeat of Con&s;tans is on the minds of his followers; you cannot gratify him or them more than to give them a &s;econd occa&s;ion, and by the &s;ame means, to &s;ave their country. The brother of that ad|miral, a member of this hou&s;e,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">General <HI>Keppel.</HI></NOTE> bred al&s;o in the be&s;t &s;chools of his profe&s;&s;ion, is &s;econd in command on &s;hore, and &s;econd to one who needs no other prai&s;e than that he was the fa|vourite,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Am|her&s;t.</HI></NOTE> and the friend, and the confidential executor of the arduous plans of the great &s;tate&s;man I alluded to.&mdash;Let the&s;e men be a&s;|&s;i&s;ted with national &s;pirit, and England is not to be &s;ubdued, while a river or a hill remains; without &s;uch &s;pirit, another battle of Ha&s;tings may make another conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir, I repeat that the be&s;t hope of generat|ing and diffu&s;ing this genuine &s;trength of the mind, to which arms and trea&s;ure are but ina|dequate &s;ub&s;titutes, depends upon the pre&s;ence of parliament, <Q REND="inline">"to provide (according to the
<PB N="40" REF="43">
words of the motion) for every important event at the earlie&s;t notice,"&mdash;</Q>To &s;trengthen the crown, not by adulatory addre&s;&s;es, but by &s;uch occa&s;ional &s;anctions, as would give fre&s;h and extra-energy to its power, pend|ing the emergency that might require it: To &s;upport public credit, in union with the city of London, not only by common engage|ments of faith, but by acts of quick and en|couraging efficacy towards individuals, who might nobly ri&s;k their all in the cau&s;e: but above all, in full numbers and by general con|tinuance, to exhibit them&s;elves to the world a true repre&s;entative of a determined people at|tacked in their vitals;&mdash;to prove that they are not to be &s;educed from their duty by the al|lurements of plea&s;ure or per&s;onal intere&s;t, but have fortitude to await the approach of the enemy, as the Gauls were awaited by the &s;enators in Rome; and, if need were, to receive death in the&s;e &s;eats, to give example and fire to their &s;urviving countrymen. Sir, a parliament, thus in&s;pired, (the occa&s;ion, I be|lieve in my con&s;cience, would give the in&s;pi|ration) would &s;pread immediate and exten&s;ive veneration and influence.&mdash;Faction in this great city, if faction there is, would be no more;&mdash;majorities and minorities here would
<PB N="41" REF="44">
be lo&s;t in unanimity for the public &s;afety;&mdash;the King's name, thus &s;upported, would be in truth a tower of &s;trength; and the daring at|tempts of the enemy would only tend to the pre&s;ent glory and future &s;tability of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Sir, the&s;e are my &s;incere &s;entiments; and for this free delivery of them, I doubt not that I &s;hall read in the morning papers of to-morrow that I have thrown my&s;elf into the arms of oppo&s;ition. I am con&s;cious I never did &s;o true a &s;ervice to the king and to the country as I do in the part I now take; and whatever may be the idle comments of the day, I tru&s;t that with the re&s;pectable part of the public, if the term <HI>op|po&s;ition</HI> is to imply blame, it will be ap|plicable only to the rejection of this motion. If the king's mini&s;ters take the lead, and exerci&s;e their per&s;ua&s;ion for that purpo&s;e, I hold them to be oppo&s;ers of national &s;pirit, oppo&s;ers of public virtue, oppo&s;ers of the mo&s;t efficacious means to &s;ave their country. Sir, I &s;corn to take up this lan|guage upon &s;o pitiful a motive as per&s;onal re&s;entment. Government, whoever are the mini&s;ters to conduct it, &s;hall have my voice when my con&s;cience directs it. That I think my&s;elf a per&s;ecuted man, I avow;
<PB N="42" REF="45">
that I am a marked victim to bear the &s;ins that do not belong to me, I apprehend; but this is not the fir&s;t time I have &s;tood the frowns of power for parliamentary conduct; and whatever further vengeance may be in &s;tore for me, I hope I &s;hall endure it as be|comes me. I am aware that in far better times officers have been &s;tript of their pre|ferments for re&s;i&s;ting the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of that bench.&mdash;They cannot take from me an humble competence; they cannot deprive me of a qualification to &s;it here; they cannot &s;trip me, I tru&s;t they cannot, of the confidence of my con&s;tituents to &s;eat me here; they cannot &s;trip me&mdash;I am &s;ure they cannot&mdash;of prin|ciple and &s;pirit to do my duty here.</P>
<P>I never was more excited by the&s;e mo|tives, and I never can be more, than upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to give my vote in &s;upport of the motion.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from General <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> to Lieutenant General <HI>Burgoyne.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Head-Quarters, <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 11th, 1778.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was, only two days &s;ince, honoured with your very obliging letter of the 11th of February.</P>
<P>Your indulgent opinion of my character, and the polite terms in which you are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s it, are peculiarly flattering; and I take plea&s;ure in the opportunity you have afforded me of a&s;&s;uring you, that, far from &s;uffering the views of national oppo&s;ition to be imbittered and deba&s;ed by per&s;onal animo|&s;ity, I am ever ready to do ju&s;tice to the me|rit of the gentleman and the &s;oldier; and to e&s;teem, where e&s;teem is due, however the idea of a public enemy may interpo&s;e. You will not think it the language of unmeaning cere|mony, if I add, that &s;entiments of per&s;onal re&s;pect, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, are reciprocal.</P>
<P><PB REF="47">Viewing you in the light of an officer con|tending again&s;t what I conceive to be the rights of my country, the rever&s;e of fortune you experienced in the field cannot be unacceptable to me; but, ab&s;tracted from con&s;iderations of national advantage, I can &s;incerely &s;ympathize with your feelings, as a &s;oldier, the unavoida|ble difficulties of who&s;e &s;ituation forbid his &s;ucce&s;s; and as a man, who&s;e lot combines the calamity of ill health, the anxieties of captivity, and the painful &s;en&s;ibility for a re|putation, expo&s;ed, where he mo&s;t values it, to the a&s;&s;aults of malice and detraction.</P>
<P>As your aid de camp went directly on to Congre&s;s, the bu&s;ine&s;s of your letter to me had been decided before it came to hand. I am happy that their chearful acquie&s;cence with your reque&s;t, prevented the nece&s;&s;ity of my intervention. And, wi&s;hing you a &s;afe and agreeable pa&s;&s;age, with a perfect re&s;toration of your health,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, Very re&s;pectfully, Sir, Your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, GEO. WASHINGTON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>NOTE, re&s;pecting the Fir&s;t Debate.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;peech has been prepared for the pre&s;s, it has been ob&s;erved, in a daily paper, that General Burgoyne &s;ta|ted, that it had been a race between the Con|gre&s;s and him, to engage the Indian nations. It is a mi&s;take, that General Burgoyne made any mention of him&s;elf being any ways con|cerned in any negotiations with the Indians, prior to giving directions for their junction with the army upon Lake Champlain; ex|cepting in the council of the autumn to 1776, in which they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for that year.</P>
<P>It is true, General Burgoyne did &s;tate, in his &s;peech, that there had been a race between the emi&s;&s;aries of the Congre&s;s, and the con|ductors of India affairs on the part of the Bri|ti&s;h government; to engage not only the contiguous, but al&s;o the remote nations. This fact might have been proved by Mr. St. Luc+le Corne, had he thought proper, as well as by many others.</P>
<P>This part of the Indian &s;ubject accidental|ly e&s;caped the pre&s;s, by its being omitted in the notes from which the &s;peech was collected.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE, re&s;pecting the Second Debate.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Wedderburne took occa&s;ion, after a &s;hort argument again&s;t the expediency of the motion, to propound <HI>doubts</HI> relative to Ge|neral Burgoyne's capacity to vote in parlia|ment; and he argued them, at length, with vi&s;ible preparation, and much learning. He referred, very particularly, to the &s;tory of Regulus; and, to make the ca&s;es parallel, &s;tated the General as a common pri&s;oner of war (the convention of Saratoga being broke); that, con&s;equently, he was not <HI>&s;ui juris,</HI> but the pre&s;ent property of another power. He in&s;i&s;ted, with &s;till le&s;s expre&s;&s;ion of doubt, that the General, under his pre&s;ent obligations, was incapacitated from exerci&s;ing any office, or bearing arms in this country.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne, in reply, &s;tated the mi&s;|take upon which Mr. Wedderburne's argu|ment was in great mea&s;ure founded, viz. that the convention was <HI>broke,</HI> and that the Gene|ral was under the u&s;ual re&s;trictions of a pri|&s;oner of war. The convention was declared by the congre&s;s not intended to be broke, on their part; though the execution of it was &s;u&s;pended. The General therefore in&s;i&s;ted, that he was under no other obligation, than
<PB REF="50">
that &s;pecified in the convention, <Q REND="inline">"Not to &s;erve in America;"</Q> and that of his parole, <Q REND="inline">"To return at the demand of the congre&s;s, and due notice given":</Q> that in this country he was free to exerci&s;e his rights as a citizen and a &s;oldier; that &s;hould the enemy land, though his pre&s;ent disfavour might preclude him from the command which his rank, and &s;ome experience, might entitle him to, he tru&s;ted the king would not refu&s;e his reque&s;t, to take a mu&s;quet in defence of his country. He proceeded to argue, that even upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that Mr. Wedderburne's po&s;ition had been true in its full extent, and that he had been, <HI>directly,</HI> a pri&s;oner of war under pa|role, he &s;hould not have been incapacitated from acting in parliament; and in an&s;wer to the precedents brought from remote ages, he produced one of a pre&s;ent member (Lord Fre|derick Cavendi&s;h) who, when a pri&s;oner to France, after the action at St. Cas, and upon his parole in England, &s;at and voted in par|liament. That noble lord, upon quitting France, had a&s;ked, whether any re&s;traint in that re&s;pect was meant? as he &s;hould certain|ly vote for every mea&s;ure that could di&s;tre&s;s the enemy&mdash;He was told, that they &s;hould as &s;oon think of re&s;training him from getting a
<PB REF="51">
child, left, when it came to maturity, it &s;hould do them mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The General proceeded to ob&s;erve, that the ca&s;es, in point of explanation, were preci&s;ely the &s;ame; for that before he left the army, it had been intimated to him, that there were per&s;ons, <HI>in Bo&s;ton,</HI> who <HI>doubted</HI> whether he &s;hould not be re&s;trained by parole from taking any part in parliament, at lea&s;t, when Ameri|ca was concerned; that he came to an expla|nation with tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the &s;enti|ments and powers of the congre&s;s; and de|clared, that if &s;uch re&s;traint was intended, he would remain and die in that country, rather than return home&mdash;The idea was aboli&s;hed; nay, more, it was expre&s;&s;ed, that the friends of the congre&s;s conceived rather advantage than injury from the General's pre&s;ence in par|liament; that they wi&s;hed for peace upon pro|per terms; that they were per&s;uaded, the Ge|neral, as a man of humanity, wi&s;hed the &s;ame; that they believed he had honour to &s;peak truth; and that truth would conduce to that de&s;irable end.</P>
<P>After this explanation, Mr. Wedderburne acknowledged no doubts remained upon, the General's rights; and the hou&s;e were unani|mous in the &s;ame opinion.</P>
