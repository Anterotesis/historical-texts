<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Abelard and Eloi&s;a flouri&s;hed in the twelfth century: they were two of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons of their age in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion. After a long cour&s;e of calamities, they retired each to a &s;everal convent, and con&s;ecrated the remainder of their days to religion. It was many years after this &s;eparation, that a letter of Abelard's to a friend, which contained the hi&s;|tory of his misfortunes, fell into the hands of Eloi&s;a: this occa&s;ioned tho&s;e celebrated letters (out of which the following is partly extracted), which give &s;o lively a picture of the &s;truggles of grace and nature, virtue and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
