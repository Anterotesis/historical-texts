<P>THE TRAVELLER, OR A PROSPECT of SOCIETY. A POEM. INSCRIBED TO THE REV. MR. HENRY GOLDSMITH. BY OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M. B.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed for J. NEWBERY, in St. Paul's Church-yard. MDCCLXV.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE REV. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that the friend&s;hip between us can ac|quire no new force from the ceremonies of a De|dication; and perhaps it demands an excu&s;e thus to prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline giving with your own. But as a part of this Poem was formerly written to you from Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety, be only in&s;cribed to you. It will al&s;o throw a light upon many parts of it, when the rea|der under&s;tands that it is addre&s;&s;ed to a man, who, de|&s;pi&s;ing Fame and Fortune, has retired early to Hap|pine&s;s and Ob&s;curity, with an income of forty pounds a year.</P>
<P>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wi&s;dom of your humble choice. You have entered upon a &s;acred office, where the harve&s;t is great, and the labourers are but few;
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
while you have left the field of Ambition, where the labourers are many, and the harve&s;t not worth carry|ing away. But of all kinds of ambition, as things are now circum&s;tanced, perhaps that which pur&s;ues poetical fame, is the wilde&s;t. What from the encrea&s;ed refinement of the times, from the diver&s;ity of judgments produced by oppo&s;ing &s;y&s;tems of critici&s;m, and from the more prevalent divi&s;ions of opinion influenced by party, the &s;tronge&s;t and happie&s;t efforts can expect to plea&s;e but in a very narrow circle. Though the poet were as &s;ure of his aim as the imperial archer of antiquity, who boa&s;ted that he never mi&s;&s;ed the heart; yet would many of his &s;hafts now fly at random, for the heart is too often in the wrong place.</P>
<P>Poetry makes a principal amu&s;ement among unpoli&s;hed nations; but in a country verging to the extremes of re|finement, Painting and Mu&s;ic come in for a &s;hare. And as they offer the feeble mind a le&s;s laborious entertain|ment, they at fir&s;t rival Poetry, and at length &s;upplant her; they engro&s;s all favour to them&s;elves, and though but younger &s;i&s;ters, &s;eize upon the elder's birth-right.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">Yet, however this art may be neglected by the pow|erful, it is &s;till in greater danger from the mi&s;taken efforts of the learned to improve it. What critici&s;ms have we not heard of late in favour of blank ver&s;e, and Pin|daric odes, choru&s;&s;es, anape&s;ts and iambics, alliterative care, and happy negligence. Every ab&s;urdity has now a champion to defend it, and as he is generally much in the wrong, &s;o he has always much to &s;ay.</P>
<P>But there is an enemy to this art &s;till more dangerous, I mean party. Party entirely di&s;torts the judgment, and de&s;troys the ta&s;te. A mind capable of reli&s;hing general beauty, when once infected with this di&s;ea&s;e, can only find plea&s;ure in what contributes to encrea&s;e the di&s;tem|per. Like the tyger, that &s;eldom de&s;i&s;ts from pur&s;uing man after having once preyed upon human fle&s;h, the reader, who has once gratified his appetite with calumny, makes, ever after, the mo&s;t agreeable fea&s;t upon mur|dered reputation. Such readers generally admire &s;ome half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold man, having lo&s;t the character of a wi&s;e one. Him they dig|nify with the name of poet; his lampoons are called
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
&s;atires, his turbulence is &s;aid to be force, and his phrenzy fire.</P>
<P>What reception a Poem may find, which has neither abu&s;e, party, nor blank ver&s;e to &s;upport it, I cannot tell, nor am I much &s;olicitous to know. My aims are right. Without e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of any party, I have at|tempted to moderate the rage of all. I have endeavoured to &s;hew, that there may be equal happine&s;s in other &s;tates, though differently governed from our own; that each &s;tate has a peculiar principle of happine&s;s, and that this principle in each &s;tate, and in our own in particular, may be carried to a mi&s;chievous exce&s;s. There are few can judge, better than you&s;elf, How far the&s;e po&s;itions are illu&s;trated in this Poem.</P>

<L>Her uplands &s;loping deck the mountain's &s;ide,</L>

<L>But &s;mall the bli&s;s that &s;en&s;e alone be&s;tows,</L>
<L>And &s;en&s;ual bli&s;s is all this nation knows.</L>

<L>The mind &s;till turns where &s;hifting fa&s;hion draws,</L>

<L>To men of other minds my fancy flies,</L>

<L>And, &s;edulous to &s;top the coming tide,</L>
<L>Lift the tall rampire's artificial pride,</L>
<L>That &s;preads its arms amid&s;t the watry roar,</L>
<L>Scoops out an empire, and u&s;urps the &s;hore.</L>
<L>Onward methinks, and diligently &s;low</L>
