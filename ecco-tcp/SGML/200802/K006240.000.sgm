<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following poem is not more an effu&s;ion of loyalty, than it is a public con|gratulation. The relative happine&s;s likely to re&s;ult from the union it celebrates, is &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;olemnly intere&s;ting to every Briti&s;h &s;ubject; &s;ince the equivocal te|nure of regal power in other countries, mu&s;t naturally render every additional link to the chain of public &s;ecurity here, an object of con&s;iderable magnitude; and, as hereditary right is the &s;tronge&s;t &s;upport of the con&s;titution, and the faire&s;t ornament of the crown, as experience has given us proof upon proof how dangerous to this nation is a doubtful right, every hone&s;t man mu&s;t of cour&s;e ble&s;s an event likely to en&s;ure the Engli&s;h throne to the pre&s;ent family.</P>
<P>As to the poem it&s;elf, it may perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething in expla|nation of it; for I am willing to acknowledge, that warmth and fancy &s;eldom permit me to conform to mere rule; and that, in general, I have better &s;ucceeded when my hand has obeyed my conception, than when cold correctne&s;s has &s;hrouded my ideas in a regular arrangement of words.</P>
<P>I call it an ode, as the mo&s;t unexceptionable de&s;cription I can give it. It is not, however, an ode &s;trictly &s;peaking; for I do not clog my&s;elf with the dull re|gularity of making my STROPHE turn to the left, my ANTISTROPHE to the right, or my EPODE &s;ing before the altar. It is not lyric, except in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of the ac|ceptation, that of being written for mu&s;ic. Of the dithyrambic, it certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the rapture, but not the phrenzy. It is not Pindaric, for though it has flights in plenty, it aims at no &s;ublimity but that which is the offspring of &s;implicity.</P>
<P>In &s;ome re&s;pects it re&s;embles the epithalamium, but not in all; for that &s;pecies of panegyric, generally taken, is purcha&s;ed prai&s;e, performed in the pre&s;ence of the bride and bridegroom, circum&s;tances that will not be attributed to me or to my poem; for all the world &s;hould not buy my commendation; and the work it&s;elf will &s;uf|ficiently vouch for me that there is too much of the heart in it to &s;avour of &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>Its irregularities, however, are its advantages, for they furni&s;h a bolder &s;cope to the imagination, and give additional force and effect to the mo&s;t enchanting of all mediums that ever conveyed plea&s;ure to the heart. In a word, I have gone for &s;trength without heavine&s;s, prai&s;e without adulation, figure without di&s;tortion; I
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
have endeavoured to be playful, not ludicrous; bold, not daring; ea&s;y, not quaint. But the mo&s;t prominent feature in the picture is rapture; to which, perhaps, I may have given a latitude &s;omewhat bordering on that extravagance which, on ordinary occa&s;ions, literally taken, might be called hyperbole; but which, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, applied figuratively, is appropriate and in place.</P>
<P>I think I &s;hall be allowed &s;ome credit for the con&s;truction of the poem. There is a novelty in commanding the attendance of the mu&s;es and their mi&s;&s;ion to the cele&s;tials, and the groupe bending from Olympus to behold the landing of the prince&s;s, would not make an unworthy figure upon canva&s;s. The &s;alutation of Britannia is intere&s;ting, and her leading the bride in nuptial pomp to the temple of Hymen, &s;urrounded by an admiring populace, is &s;till more &s;o. Nor can Engli&s;h|men hear unmoved that prophecy of Fame at the conclu&s;ion, which I, for one, wi&s;h with all my &s;oul may be literally verified.</P>
<P>As to the mu&s;ic it&s;elf, it is compo&s;ed, not con&s;tructed; written to the heart, not to the head; I have made melody my outline; and, through the wide range of that field of fancy, I have endeavoured to excite feeling, create intere&s;t, and convey plea&s;ure. As to the harmony, no more now, than upon other occa&s;ions, have I any thing ab&s;tru&s;e; for, though I have plenty of modulation, yet I have taken every po&s;&s;ible care cautiou&s;ly to avoid an obtru&s;ion of di&s;cord into the temple of Hymen.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I have written as I felt. I am rejoiced at this event, becau&s;e I am an Engli&s;hman; becau&s;e the true &s;ecurity of Engli&s;h freedom, that my father taught me to venerate, that I liberally enjoy, and that will con&s;titute the be&s;t happine&s;s of my children, will be promoted by it. Therefore, be my ode Lyric, Dithyrambic, or Pindaric; a mixture of all, or a likene&s;s of none, it is hone&s;t and &s;incere, and comes warm from the heart. Thus, though I only &s;hall have manife&s;ted my admiration of tho&s;e who are more immediately concerned, and my gratitude to the public, who are collaterally intere&s;ted, my labour will not have been in vain, for I &s;hall have gratified an ardent zeal, and added one &s;hout, though but a feeble one, to the wil|ling and merited acclamations of a loyal and happy people.</P>
