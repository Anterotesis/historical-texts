<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we come to &s;peak of <HI>paying the Nation's Debt,</HI> a thing that (one would think) every Body &s;hould re|joyce at, and the very Notion of which ought to be receiv'd with Thankfulne&s;s and Acknow|ledgment; It's wonderful to find every At|tempt, every E&s;&s;ay &s;urrounded with Cavil and Clamour, all po&s;&s;ible Objection and Ob&s;truc|tion thrown in the way, and even the very People who are to be delivered by it, oppo|&s;ing it with all their Power.</P>
<P>Even the Friends of the De&s;ign, di&s;couraged by the SEEMING <HI>Difficulties,</HI> and the Dan|gers of the Attempt, appear willing to de&s;pond and to &s;it down where they are.</P>
<P>I call them SEEMING <HI>Difficulties,</HI> for they are no more: The Schemes that have al|ready been laid down, and offer'd to our View by &s;everal Hands, be&s;ides what are &s;till behind, are evident Proofs that the Difficulties are no more than Shadows, that the Oppo&s;ers con&s;i&s;t only, or chiefly, of a few Bullying STOCK-JOBBERS, <HI>Gens d'affaires,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> call them; Men who ought to look into <HI>France,</HI> to the <HI>Chamber of Ju&s;tice,</HI> and &s;ee <HI>there</HI> what they de&s;erve; and to look up to Heaven, and be thankful that they live in a Country, where
<PB REF="5">
as they cannot be puni&s;hed, <HI>but by Law,</HI> &s;o they go free, <HI>not for their Innocence,</HI> but be|cau&s;e their Crimes are of a kind that our An|ce&s;tors never heard of, and therefore could make no Laws again&s;t.</P>
<P>I can liken the pre&s;ent Temper of our Peo|ple, in their Backwardne&s;s to this Great and Nece&s;&s;ary Work, to nothing &s;o well as to that &s;candalous Cowardice and Indolence of <HI>So|lomon</HI>'s Sluggard, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxii. 13. He was cer|tainly call'd out to &s;ome Publick Work, that requir'd him to go boldly and briskly abroad, and attempt &s;omething for the good of the City, in &s;ome publick Place, (<HI>perhaps like</HI> Ex|change-Alley) where the Heads of the Ene|mies of their Country were &s;ure to be a&s;&s;em|bled; <HI>no &s;ays he,</HI> &s;hrugging up his Shoulders, <HI>I care not</HI> to meddle with it; <HI>there is a Ly|on without, I &s;hall be &s;lain in the Streets:</HI> Tho' perhaps had he gone boldly and re&s;olutely out in Defence of his Country, he would have found nothing but a Mobb of empty ratling In&s;olent Phari&s;ees, dre&s;s'd up in broad Phala|cteries of <HI>Bear-Skins,</HI> who would have &s;lunk away from the Face of Truth. But the Man was lazy and unperforming, terrify'd and de&s;pon|ding, and &s;o his Country's Deliverance had none of his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and ju&s;t &s;o it is here.</P>
<P>At length the happy Time is come, that the Fall of this Great <HI>Diana</HI> is inevita|ble. They have, like Vultures, prey'd upon the Vitals of the Nation, and devour'd the
<PB REF="6">
People with U&s;ury and Extortion for above Twenty Years, and they ought to think the Nation very kind to them that they are per|mitted to go off without being oblig'd to re|fund.</P>
<P>And let them go, let them Account in the next World for their Frauds and Extor|tions; tho&s;e e&s;pecially who &s;ubjected their Country to &s;uch a Condition of being rava|ged by U&s;ury; I &s;ay <HI>let them go;</HI> our Bu&s;ine&s;s is to deliver our Native Country from the inevitable Ruin which would be the Con&s;e|quence of the&s;e things; and to joyn our Endea|vours with all tho&s;e that de&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>Great Britain</HI> once again <HI>a Free Nation;</HI> for, <HI>by the way,</HI> It is in vain to talk of the Liberties and Privileges of a Nation that is in Slavery to Creditors, and chain'd down to the mi&s;erable Con&s;equences of an in&s;upportable Debt: No Liberties can be long &s;upported, when the Means of re&s;i&s;ting the Power of Enemies is out of our Hands; <HI>For</HI> while the Nation is overwhelm'd in Debt, &s;he lies bound Hand and Foot, a Prey to every beggarly de&s;perate Invader.</P>
<P>The following Di&s;cour&s;e is adapted to clear the way to this great Undertaking, to remove the Rubbi&s;h which lies in the way, to prove the De&s;ign practicable and feazible as it really is, and the Objections frivolous and trifling, <HI>as they really are;</HI> that we may not &s;tumble at the Thre&s;hold, and that all tho&s;e di&s;courag'd
<PB REF="7">
People who &s;it down in their Fetters de&s;pond|ing and out of Hopes of their Deliverance from the black Pro&s;pect that is before them, and the Difficulties in the Performance, which they &s;ay they cannot &s;ee thro', may be rouz'd and animated to &s;et their Hands to the Work, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the freeing them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity from a Burthen which they are not able to bear.</P>
<P>When this is done, the People encouraged to the Work, and the Enemies &s;ilenc'd in their popular Objections <HI>again&s;t it:</HI> The Schemes for the Performance will be &s;hort and ea&s;ie, and the Parliament, who are &s;o hap|pily mov'd from the Throne to engage in it, will find it very ea&s;y to make a beginning, and to put the whole Affair in &s;uch a Me|thod, as that, <HI>as was &s;aid of a thing much more Improbable,</HI> The Scheme <HI>&s;hall Execute it &s;elf.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. That <HI>Now is the Time,</HI> and that it is ab&s;o|lutely Nece&s;&s;ary to begin it <HI>Now,</HI> to rid the Nation of an in&s;upportable Burthen, whatever other Difficulties are upon us.</HEAD>
<P>THAT what I am to pre&s;s with &s;uch Vehemence, and per&s;uade People to with &s;o much Earne&s;t|ne&s;s, may not come headlong upon their Hands, and be as it were cram'd down their Throats by the Power and Multitude of Words without Rea&s;oning; I demand of the World to clear up the Way to it before I begin.</P>
<P>We are all intent upon reducing the Nation's Debts, and delivering our Coun|try from the Embarra&s;ments of Twenty Years Wars, and the un&s;ufferable Burthen of innumerable Taxes; the Thing is be|come Popular, every one talks of it, the King has Recommended it, the Parliament have engag'd to con&s;ider of it, Writers
<PB N="2" REF="9">
and Projectors have prepar'd Schemes for it, and made Propo&s;als, and the Nation longs to hear whether they may flatter them&s;elves with the Hopes of it: But &s;ome Men come and offer an Objection again&s;t it in the Gro&s;s, and in the Name of all that are on the other Side; and this Objection I meet with very few who have either attempted to remove, or perhaps enquir'd whether they are able to remove it or no.</P>
<P>The Objection is this.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The Project of reducing or redeem|ing the Nation's Debts is attended with great Difficulties, will pinch hard in ma|ny Ca&s;es, &s;eems to be touch'd with Op|pre&s;&s;ion in &s;ome, and even with National Inju&s;tice in others, at lea&s;t many pretend &s;o; and cry out of Ingratitude, Di&s;re|gard to the Exigencies the Publick was in when they borrow'd their Money, and the hazard the Lenders run at that time whether ever it &s;hould be re-pay'd or no: likewi&s;e the time is not &s;o long till many of the Funds will expire, the <HI>Exchequer</HI> Bills will be all &s;unk in Ten Years Tho&s;e Funds given for 32 Years have &s;ome of them but 25, others 27, and the longe&s;t 29 Years to expire, when the Continuance of the &s;ame Taxes for a little longer will redeem all the re&s;t, &s;o that in about 35 Years at mo&s;t, the Nation may be out of Debt by the cour&s;e of Things; whereas by the Methods
<PB N="3" REF="10">
which are propo&s;ed it will not be done under 22 Years; the Que&s;tion then is, What ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity are we in to pu&s;h the Government upon a thing of &s;o much Difficulty, and attended with &s;uch Circum&s;tances, and at &s;uch a time of prevailing Danger as this is al&s;o, and when &s;uch great Demands are upon us on other Publick and pre&s;&s;ing Accounts?</Q></P>
<P>It's hop'd if this weighty Objection, or rather Body of Objections can be removed, what is farther to be &s;aid of the Ea&s;ine&s;s and Profitablene&s;s of the De&s;ign will be much better receiv'd and be li&s;tned to with the more Attention; and therefore in &s;tate|ing the Objection, I have endeavour'd to do the Objectors all the Ju&s;tice they can de&s;ire, &s;tateing the whole Sum of their Ca|vils in their own Words, and as fully as they could de&s;ire to have them expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Que&s;tion is this, <HI>What Nece&s;&s;ity there is of this Attempt at this time?</HI> The An&s;wer is clear.</P>
<P>It has already been too long that the Nation has groan'd under the heavy Bur|then of in&s;upportable Taxes; the People call Now aloud to their Repre&s;entatives to be relieved by them. The Oppre&s;s'd labouring and Trading People, <HI>for they are the particu|lar People who, I &s;ay, groan under the Weight, and to whom it is really in&s;uppor|table,</HI> at the &s;ame time that they are rejoyce|ing at the Return of King <HI>George,</HI> and re|ceive
<PB N="4" REF="11">
His Maje&s;ty with Acclamations and Te&s;timonies of their Satisfaction at his be|ing placed upon the Throne; at the &s;ame time, I &s;ay, they &s;tretch forth their Hands to him for the Ea&s;e of their Burthens; for the lightning the Oppre&s;&s;ions of his Ance|&s;tors, and &s;etting them Free from the Task-Ma&s;ters who in Swarms devour their La|bour by rapid Exactions upon their common Nece&s;&s;aries, &s;uch as their <HI>Fuell,</HI> their <HI>Soap,</HI> their <HI>Hops,</HI> their <HI>Shoe-Leather,</HI> their <HI>Salt;</HI> they can neither enjoy <HI>Day-light</HI> or <HI>Candle-light,</HI> but they pay for the Holes one &s;hines in at, and the Wicks the other &s;hines out from. 'Tis for this they look upon King <HI>George</HI> to be their <HI>Deliverer,</HI> and 'tis this will Rivet his Memory in the Hearts of the Ages to come; this &s;hall Record the Illu&s;trious Race of <HI>Hannover</HI> in the Minds of the Common People in a Cha|racter more indelible than that of Hi&s;tory, and in a Tradition never to be worn out till it turn by length of Time into Fable and Romance. When the Name of <HI>George</HI> may not Occur to the Ignorant Tongues of &s;ome, he will be remember'd by the General Character, and be referr'd to under the De&s;cription of that Good King that took away the Taxes. This is the Rea&s;on why it &s;hould be done now, and no doubt as Queen <HI>Anne</HI> &s;aid of the Union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;o would His Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="5" REF="12">
&s;ay of the Delivering his People from this Bondage, <HI>That he &s;hould account it the greate&s;t Glory of his Reign if it might be &s;aid this Great Work &s;hould b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> fini&s;hed in his time.</HI></P>
<P>I might go on to &s;ay, the Rea&s;on why this is the Time, is becau&s;e really the Na|tion is not able to bear this Weight <HI>any longer;</HI> and therefore it was that I call'd it <HI>an in&s;upportable Weight;</HI> and &s;uch no doubt it is, becau&s;e, as may ea&s;ily be De|mon&s;trated by &s;ad Examples, many Fami|lies, who were able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t before, have &s;unk under the Pre&s;&s;ure, and have been forc'd to give up; <HI>Di&s;&s;olving</HI> into Beggary; which in a Word, &s;peaking of Families, is De&s;truction and Di&s;&s;olution; and this proves the Word <HI>in&s;upportable</HI> to be mo&s;t Ju&s;t, and to be particularly applicable to this very Ca&s;e, for &s;uch Burthens and Pre&s;&s;ures which Families do really &s;ink under, and by which they are reduc'd to Mi&s;ery and Beggary, may very well be &s;aid to be <HI>in&s;upportable to them</HI></P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erv'd by &s;ome who have written judiciou&s;ly on the&s;e Heads, that the Weight of the Taxes has principally fallen upon tho&s;e of the People who live not on the Income of their real E&s;tates, but on the precarious Fruit of their daily Labour, e|&s;pecially in Handycrafts, Manufactures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Mannaging and Conducting the
<PB N="6" REF="13">
Day-Labour of others under them; including tho&s;e who live by the buying, &s;elling, fetching, carrying, and removing from Place to Place the Produce of the &s;aid la|bouring Part. It is mo&s;t ju&s;t to &s;ay, that the&s;e are by far the mo&s;t Numerous among the Inhabitants of <HI>Britain,</HI> and are the People who are in many Re&s;pects the Strength, the Life, and the Soul of the whole Body; like the Hands and the Feet to the Belly, by which it is filled, and the Body made fat and flouri&s;hing: As the&s;e are the Support of the whole, &s;o they &s;hould be the Care of the whole; and the Nur&s;ing Fathers of the Common wealth ought in more than ordinary Manner to &s;how their Regard to them, and to be care|ful that they are not di&s;abled, di&s;couraged, and unhing'd from that Labour and that Indu&s;try which is &s;o U&s;eful, &s;o Profitable, and &s;o E&s;&s;ential to the Common-wealth as well as to their own Families.</P>
<P>The Labouring and Indu&s;trious Trades-Men and Manufacturers are not &s;o incon|&s;iderable a part of this Nation, as &s;ome Peo|ple for want of Con&s;ideration have been apt to &s;ugge&s;t: On the contrary, they are indeed the Life of our Commerce; by their Numbers they make our home Con|&s;umption which &s;upports the Landed-Men, make a Demand for the Produce of the Land, keep up the Rents of Farms, and
<PB N="7" REF="14">
thereby make the Land-Tax produce &s;o many Millions. They form our Manu|factures which con&s;umes the Wool, Clothes the whole People, and gives <HI>England</HI> a ju&s;t Title to the mo&s;t valuable Export of any Nation in the World.</P>
<P>Without the&s;e, <HI>that Plenty</HI> which is God's Ble&s;&s;ing to the Nation <HI>would peri&s;h as Dung upon the Ground,</HI> and the Corn and Cattle would be our Burthen not our Advantage; till <HI>England</HI> which is now as the Garden of God would become a For|re&s;t, and like the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> cea&s;e to flow with Milk and Honey, not for want of Fertility to produce it, but for want of People to con&s;ume it.</P>
<P>The&s;e I &s;ay are the People on whom the Weight of our innumerable Taxes lye now &s;o heavy; who pay for their Malt, Salt, Coal, Candle, Soap, Leather, Gla&s;s-Win|dows, and in a Word, for tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Things which God knows thou&s;ands of them u&s;ed &s;paringly before, and are now &s;carce able to u&s;e at all, till they are brought to bleeding Extremities, and to a Mi&s;ery &s;carce to be expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t of the&s;e Calamitous Times came upon this Nation, the Poor u&s;ually comforted them&s;elves with &s;aying, <HI>That ble&s;&s;ed be God the Nece&s;&s;aries of Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> were not Tax'd, and that as the Rich m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the War, &s;o the Rich pay'd for it;</HI> bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="8" REF="15">
was but a little while that this la&s;ted; <HI>For Example,</HI> it was but a little while that the Calamities of War and the Scarcity of Fo|reign Countries rather than our own, <HI>rai|&s;ed the Price of Corn,</HI> and that to &s;uch a Degree, as that be&s;ides the Hard&s;hip our Poor &s;uffered in the&s;e Parts of <HI>England,</HI> it's yet fre&s;h in the Memories of us all, that in the Northern Parts of <HI>England</HI> many peri&s;hed of meer Want, and in <HI>Scotland, then a &s;eparate Nation,</HI> no le&s;s than 18000 People, as the Writers of that Nation have declared, dyed of meer Famine, the mi|&s;erable Particulars of which are too many to repeat.</P>
<P>It's a mo&s;t prepo&s;terous thing to &s;ay the Poor have paid no Tax upon Corn, let it be enquir'd how many Millions it has co&s;t the middling working Families of this Nation, &s;ince the beginning of the fir&s;t War, in the &s;everal ri&s;ings of the Prices of Corn, &s;ometimes upon ju&s;t, &s;ometimes up|on unrea&s;onable, and &s;ometimes meer ima|ginary Occa&s;ions, which Ri&s;e of the Rate has oftner happened in the&s;e 25 Years than in an Hundred Years before; nay, &s;o has it been managed that Corn has &s;carce ever been at the moderate middling Rate of 4<HI>s per</HI> Bu&s;hel two Years together &s;ince the &s;econd Year after the Revolution; and as this has been occa&s;ion'd wholly by the War, &s;o the War may ju&s;tly have been
<PB N="9" REF="16">
&s;aid to have been one continued Tax upon Corn, and the poor People I &s;peak of, have felt it very &s;everely, even to the Di&s;tre&s;s of mo&s;t of their Families and the utter Ru|in of many, to whom it has been no Difference whether the Price was exacted as a Duty and Gabel on the Corn, or by accidental rai&s;ing the Price at the Mar|ket, which was the Con&s;equence of the War, and equally Fatal to the Poor as a <HI>Tax.</HI></P>
<P>I am not talking now of the Begging Cla|mouring Poor, no nor of the meer La|bouring-Man who lives by his Hedging and Ditching; but of the Trading, Manufactu|ring, Indu&s;trious middle &s;ort of People, who keep Servants and Families, and em|ploy multitudes of Hands within Doors or without; the&s;e are the Pillars of the Na|tion, and the Support both of Rich and Poor, and <HI>in a Word</HI> the Payers of our Taxes.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Men who&s;e Families are oppre&s;s'd by the National U&s;ury, and who are cru&s;h'd and kept low to feed the Vo|racious Luxury of a few Stock-Jobbers, and enrich'd Mony-Lenders: When Publick Faith and Parliamentary Credit are plead|ed, or rather pretended, again&s;t redeeming the Nation from Ruin, let the&s;e People be heard; is there no Publick Faith plight|ed to them? is it not the be&s;t part of <HI>Par|liamentary</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="17">
<HI>Credit</HI> to be ju&s;t to them? Are not the&s;e Men repre&s;ented in Parliament? Are not thou&s;ands of them Freeholders and Freemen of Corporations, or have other|wi&s;e a Right to Vote in Elections, and did they not &s;end their Repre&s;entatives to Parliament with an entire Dependence upon <HI>Parliamentary Credit,</HI> [Mark the Word] for themelves, their Wives and Chil|dren, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that their Repre&s;entatives would never give them up for a Prey to the Avarice and Cruelty of the Nation's Creditors?</P>
<P>There has been much &s;aid among us of Equality of Taxes, I &s;hall &s;peak of it in a Chapter by it &s;elf; but it is ea&s;ie to make it appear there has been no Equality, nor indeed can be, in the Taxing the com|mon Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, becau&s;e the Poor u&s;e as much of them as the Rich, or &s;uf|fer di&s;mal Extremities for want of them, and there is no Equality in paying it.</P>
<P>Take a Family of Hone&s;t Indu&s;trious Manufacturers, &s;uppo&s;e of a Ma&s;ter-Wea|ver or any other, who labour hard them|&s;elves, keep Servants, and employ many Hands to get a moderate Living for a numerous Family; examine how much the&s;e are oblig'd to &s;pend in Coal, Candle, Salt, Soap, Leather, Window-Lights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Examine again the &s;ame Con&s;umption in a rich Stock-jobbing U&s;urer, who has a thou&s;and Pounds a Year coming in by

Bank, <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> and <HI>South-Sea</HI> Dividends, out of all which he pays nothing, and in all the Particulars of the above-named nece&s;&s;ary Things, does not con&s;ume <HI>&s;o much</HI> as the poor Weaver in his Family, the Sweat of who&s;e Brows is extorted to make the other Rich: Pray where is the Parliamentary Credit of all this?

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Nation's Circum&s;tances, as far as they may &s;erve for an Objection again&s;t redeeming or reducing the Publick Debts.</HEAD>
<P>THEY are not always the be&s;t Friends to the Nation's Circum&s;tances who make the loude&s;t Complaints about them, and make the nice&s;t Enquiries into them. But to apply our &s;elves to ju&s;t Methods to mend our Circum&s;tances, is the be&s;t Te&s;timony of our having a right Sen&s;e of them, and of our thoroughly Under&s;tanding them; Our Circum&s;tances are bad enough, but not fully &s;o bad as tho&s;e who com|plain mo&s;t, &s;eem to de&s;ire they &s;hould be, and as at la&s;t they mu&s;t be, if the Mea&s;ures for redeeming them which tho&s;e Men op|po&s;e are not thought of in time.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e is it to complain of the Nation's Circum&s;tances, and not mend them? he that offers the Remedy, complains, <HI>like a Friend,</HI> to admini&s;ter a Cure; he that op|po&s;es this Cure &s;hows he's an Enemy, and complains <HI>to Expo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Nation is in Debt, but ble&s;&s;ed be God the Nation is not Bankrupt; her Cre|ditors have all Security for their Debts; but the Continuance of the&s;e Securities will

<P>In this I mu&s;t differ from them, even to Indignation and Re&s;entment; and do affirm, that as the Work is of &s;uch Nece&s;|&s;ity as to admit no Delay, &s;o even tho&s;e very Circum&s;tances which are propo&s;ed as Hindrances are the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t in|vincible Arguments for &s;etting about it and di&s;patching it out of Hand; let's enquire with them into the Circum&s;tances of the Nation, I doubt not to make it appear that the wor&s;t of all our Circum&s;tances is this of <HI>our being in Debt;</HI> others may be fenc'd again&s;t and prevented, but this like a Wild Bea&s;t has gra&s;p'd us in its Voracious Claws, and if we are not re&s;cued from it we &s;hall be inevitably devour'd; Nay, this alone renders all Attempts again&s;t us Dangerous, for what Rebellion of di&s;affected Subjects, what Inva&s;ion of de&s;perate Enemies from abroad, need we apprehend if the Nation was not in Debt at Home? how are we now &s;tartled upon all Occa&s;ions of any

little Run upon the Publick Credit as a mortal Wound to the Common-wealth, and Stab to the Heart of the Admini&s;tra|tion!

Our Debts are the main Article that darken our Circum&s;tances, and makes every Rumour alarm us; every Con&s;piracy, tho' &s;upported but by Beggars and Mad Men, &s;eem formidable to us. Were our Debts paid, our Funds clear'd, the Cries of the oppre&s;s'd People &s;top'd, and the de&s;tructive Taxes that are &s;o ruinous to our Trade, Ma|nufactures, and even to the general Indu|&s;try of our People, were the&s;e taken off, and &s;ome le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive le&s;s grievous Me|thods found out, to pay off what is ju&s;tly Due, and a moderate Intere&s;t till 'tis done, were the&s;e things done, our Circum&s;tan|ces would mend at once, the Nation would revive and be re&s;tor'd, like one recover'd from a langui&s;hing Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>Is it not ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary then to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to put it out of the Power of her Enemies to throw her into &s;uch FITS as the&s;e? that we may no more be &s;ubject to a Blow upon our Vitals, when the Enemy who &s;trikes it is yet at Arms end; this is my meaning, <HI>when I &s;ay,</HI> the very Circum&s;tances which our Enemies alledge as Rea&s;ons again&s;t their putting an end to our State of Debt, and Bondage to Credit, are invincible Rea&s;ons why we &s;hould immediately and without any Delay &s;et about it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Parliamentary CREDIT, and the true Extent of that Word, as it re&s;pects Ju&s;tice and Honour due to the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as well as Loans of Money and Funds.</HEAD>
<P>WE have of late &s;o appropriated the Word <HI>Parliamentary Credit</HI> to the
<PB N="21" REF="28">
Stability of our Funds, and the Obligation there is upon the Parliament to make good the Conditions upon which People advanc'd their Loans, that we u&s;e it now as if it had no other Signification. But the Honour of Parliaments is engag'd in &s;e|veral Material and E&s;&s;ential Points, be|&s;ides this; in any of which &s;hould the Par|liament be deficient, they would &s;oon lo&s;e their <HI>Credit</HI> in every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>For Example: How entirely does his Maje&s;ty expre&s;s him&s;elf to depend upon the A&s;&s;urances they give him annually, and oftner, in their Addre&s;&s;es, that they will <HI>&s;tand by and a&s;&s;i&s;t His Maje&s;ty again&s;t all his Enemies at home and abroad.</HI> The&s;e Addre&s;&s;es are but Words, and would be but empty in&s;ignificant Words, nay fatal|ly deceiving Words, and would, like the High-Church Addre&s;&s;es to King <HI>James</HI> II, draw him in to depend upon them to his De|&s;truction, were they not Pledges of the Faith and Honour of Parliaments, and was not that Effectual thing called <HI>Parliamen|tary Credit</HI> engag'd to make them good: But as the Credit of Parliament is enga|ged, no King or Queen in our Age has had the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to repent their Depen|dance on that <HI>Credit,</HI> for the Supplies and A&s;&s;i&s;tance they have demanded, let the Exigencies have been what they will; and
<PB N="22" REF="29">
they would have very ill been &s;aid to have maintain'd <HI>Parliamentary Credit,</HI> tho' they made good all their Funds and Deficiencies and di&s;charg'd with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s all the Debts and Intere&s;ts contracted, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the &s;ame Time they di&s;honour'd their own A&s;&s;urances to the King, and &s;hould not perform the Promi&s;es made to his Ma|je&s;ty of Supplies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Again, What is the Security of the Pri|vileges of the People, and upon which we and our Ance&s;tors &s;o effectually have rely'd, and do with &s;uch Satisfaction and A&s;&s;u|rance &s;till depend, but the <HI>Credit</HI> of Par|liaments, that they will not be call'd Con|&s;ervators of our Liberties in vain? That they will not give up the Liberties of the People they repre&s;ent, nor betray the Tru&s;t repos'd in them by tho&s;e who cho&s;e them to be their Watchmen and Protectors?</P>
<P>I might in&s;tance many other Things which in general make up that compre|hen&s;ive Thing call'd <HI>Parliamentary Credit;</HI> but I forbear to multiply Words where the Ca&s;e is &s;ufficiently proved: I have &s;tated it thus, to clear up what follows, <HI>(viz.&punc;</HI> As <HI>Parliamentary Credit</HI> contains many Things, and &s;ignifies &s;everal Things, be&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> meerly what re&s;pects Borrowing Mony upon Funds, with making good the Deficiencie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of, and di&s;charging the Debts contracted

on tho&s;e Funds, &s;o we mu&s;t not make the General cla&s;h with its own Particulars; we mu&s;t not make <HI>Parliamentary Credit</HI> in one Article, de&s;troy <HI>Parliamentary Credit</HI> in another; make Publick Faith in one Branch incon&s;i&s;tent with the Publick Faith in another: For Example, We mu&s;t not pu&s;h the Letter of <HI>Parliamentary Acts, where they admit Con&s;tructions and Expla|nations,</HI> to a height incon&s;i&s;tent with the Common Rights and Liberties of the Peo|ple, which <HI>Parliamentary Credit</HI> is equal|ly engag'd to &s;upport. And this is the Rea&s;on why it is &s;aid, The Legi&s;lative Power cannot be limited from Expound|ing, Explaining, Altering, and Repealing all its own Acts. I bring it home to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e with all po&s;&s;ible Plainne&s;s.</P>
<P>One Parliament Entails a Debt for a certain Number of Years upon the Nation, on Conditions and with Intere&s;t, as are or may be expre&s;s'd in the Borrowing Clau&s;e.</P>
<P>No Act can with Ju&s;tice di&s;&s;olve the Debt it &s;elf, becau&s;e the Morality of the Obliga|tion is founded upon the Superior Laws of Ju&s;tice, <HI>(viz.) Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong;</HI> which no Parliamentary Power can di&s;&s;olve; no nor indeed, No Power on Earth.</P>
<P>But a &s;ub&s;equent Parliament may judge thus, that obliging the People of <HI>England</HI> to a Bondage for Years, <HI>for Debt and</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="31">
<HI>&V;&s;ury is the wor&s;t &s;ort of Bondage,</HI> is a Breach of the Natural Liberty of the Sub+ject, and they may con&s;ider of Ju&s;t and Equitable <HI>Ways</HI> of Delivering them; be+cau&s;e Pre&s;erving the Liberty of the Sub|ject is a Part of the Natural Duty of Par|liaments, and a Branch of <HI>Parliamentary Credit,</HI> as above As to what tho&s;e Equi|table Ways &s;hall be, that is not my pre&s;ent Enquiry.</P>
<P>Again, If formerly a Parliament has laid a Tax, which in proce&s;s of time, <HI>whether it was then &s;o or not,</HI> becomes grievous to one part of the People more than it is to another; or lighter to one part of the People than it is to the other; a &s;ub&s;equent Parliament, to whom it is an indi&s;pen&s;able Duty &s;o to di&s;po&s;e the common Burthens as that they may be born with Equalities and ju&s;t Proportions, and that no part of the People, as near as po&s;&s;ible, may be pre&s;s'd heavyer than ano|ther, much le&s;s be pre&s;s'd heavyer than they can bear; I &s;ay, Sub&s;equent Parlia|ments may rectify tho&s;e Inequalities with|out doubt, and bring all Per&s;ons to &s;uch Proportions as Ju&s;tice and the Nature of the Thing requires; whether it be for lay|ing Taxes upon Things formerly agreed not to be tax'd, abating Intere&s;ts where Intere&s;ts were agreed not to be abated, or any other Thing of that Nature. What
<PB N="25" REF="32">
Obligation the Parliament will think them|&s;elves under to give the Equivalent, or what Amends they will think them&s;elves obliged to make to tho&s;e who may &s;uffer in their private Gain by &s;uch Things, is not the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion: I am not debate|ing the particular Ca&s;es now, but the Right of Power.</P>
<P>Certain it is the Legi&s;lature cannot limit its &s;elf from what it has a Native Right to do; but Sub&s;equent Parliaments may undoe all that Antecedent Parlia|ments have done, <HI>who had no more Power than them&s;elves:</HI> And therefore, as a late Author &s;ays, Laws in <HI>Britain</HI> are only Precedents recommended to Po&s;terity for their Government; if they like them they let them &s;tand as they find them; if not, they Enact others, or Clau&s;es of others, with this Authoritative Sanction at the End of them, <HI>Any Thing in any former Law to the contrary in any wi&s;e notwith|&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>If in &s;uch new Laws, or Amendments to Laws, any private Per&s;on, or Place, or Body, or part of the People are aggriev'd, they are always, on their Petition, heard by their Council at the Bar of the Hou&s;e, before the Bill pa&s;&s;es; and if the Hou&s;e &s;ee Cau&s;e they concern them&s;elves to make up the real Lo&s;s to the Petitioners, if any
<PB N="26" REF="33">
&s;uch Lo&s;s appears, or otherwi&s;e to deter|mine as Ju&s;tice and Equity requires.</P>
<P>This Parliamentary Method is &s;o unex|ceptionably ju&s;t, that I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why it &s;hould not reach the Ca&s;e of the Funds now in que&s;tion, as it has, and may, all the Ca&s;es that have, or ever will come before them of that or any other kind; and that therefore it is not for us without Doors to &s;ay that this or that they <HI>cannot do</HI> without de&s;troying Parliamentary Credit. 'Tis a Part of Parliamentary Credit to maintain Parliamentary Authority; for without Par|liamentary Authority they would &s;oon have no Parliamentary Credit; let fir&s;t their Power be &s;ettled, and then 'tis Time to enquire into the Ju&s;tice of their Proceed|ings, and to &s;peak as we find.</P>
<P>For Example, to bring it nearer to the Ca&s;e, It is true that the Parliament have &s;ettled Funds for the Payment of Intere&s;t on the &s;everal Sums of Money borrow'd, and the &s;aid Funds are appropriated to the paying of &s;uch and &s;uch Annuities, as the Intere&s;t of the &s;aid Loans amount to. No Man will doubt but that the Parliament have a Right, if they &s;ee Cau&s;e, to cea&s;e or alter the Tax which is the Fund for that Payment, and order &s;ome other manner of Payment of the &s;ame Money; for the Ju&s;tice due to the Lender is, that his Mo|ney
<PB N="27" REF="34">
be paid, and 'tis equal to him whether the Fund be the &s;ame or another, his Secu|rity being not &s;imply in the Fund, but in the Parliament which gave that Fund, which is always the &s;ame; and this is what we call <HI>Parliamentary Credit</HI> in particu|lar as to Loans.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Parliamentary Credit as it re&s;pects the Publick Debts, and of the Ju&s;tice of a Re&s;olution to redeem the Publick from the Burthen.</HEAD>
<P>SPeaking of Parliamentary Credit as it re&s;pects Money borrow'd, it leads to many Pro&s;pects that are now before us; but I wave them all to that of paying off the Nation's Debts. There can be no Ob|jection again&s;t the receiv'd Maxim, <HI>That it is the Part of an Hone&s;t Man to pay his Debts;</HI> but our Ca&s;e, as a Nation, unhap|pily differs; for the Nation has &s;ome Cre|ditors who&s;e Language is, <HI>We will not be paid;</HI> you bargain'd with us to pay us our Intere&s;t for 99 Years, and we cannot be oblig'd to take our Principal whether we will or no.</P>
<P>This is a hard Ca&s;e, I confe&s;s, to the Na|tion, and makes us reproach the Memory of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters of State, ay and Parli|aments too, with Breach of Tru&s;t, and want of a faithful Di&s;charge of their Duty to the People; who in&s;tead of pre&s;erving &s;acred the Liberties of a Free People with which they were Entru&s;ted, and which, as before, it was a part of Parliamentary-Credit

<P>It's true, he has Ways and Means that con&s;i&s;t not with us, &s;uch as &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Offices, reducing their Funds by cut|ting off the Principal with the Intere&s;t, &s;queezing the Thieves of the State, and the like; but 'tis not the Manner we are upon, that's nothing to us; But this is remarkable, That the Regent has already &s;unk the Publick Debts above Twelve Hundred Millions, by one Me|thod or another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Nature of rai&s;ing or falling the National Intere&s;t of Money, and the Natural Ju&s;tice that all Publick Loans &s;hould ri&s;e and fall with it, with &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on the Rever&s;e of the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>IF there were no other Rea&s;ons for the pre&s;ent Argument, of removing our Taxes, than the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Ex|igencies of the People who groan under the Burthen of them, and which Bur|then they are able to bear no longer; I &s;ay, if there were no other Rea&s;ons, the&s;e were &s;ufficient; and I cannot think but what has already been &s;aid, amounts to a full Proof, that tho&s;e Burthens can really be born no longer.</P>
<P>But there are other things to &s;ay to it, which call loudly in Ju&s;tice to the whole Nation to go about it, particular|ly the Proportions of common Ju&s;tice due to the re&s;t of the Nation. By this common Ju&s;tice, I mean the Equality of the Intere&s;t of Money.</P>
<P>When the Loans in Parliament were fir&s;t made, the Intere&s;t of Money was then current at 6 <HI>per Cent,</HI> this was called
<PB N="38" REF="45">
Lawful Intere&s;t, and for this Rea&s;on the Intere&s;ts for Annuities granted, were all, or the greate&s;t part of them, allow'd to be at 6 <HI>per Cent. at lea&s;t,</HI> with &s;omething over upon &s;ome of them for Encou|ragement. Had the Current, or Law|ful Intere&s;t of Money at that time, been at 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and Men had been able to make no more of their Money on o|ther Securities, there is no Man &s;o weak, who knows any thing of the&s;e matters, as to think that the Publick Loans would have been for more, except &s;o much as they were then allow'd more than the common Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>When Money encreas'd, and the Na|ture of things brought the Parliament, as it were by a common con&s;ent of the whole Nation, to reduce the Intere&s;t of Money to 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> nothing was more wonderful than to think why the Parliamentary Funds were excepted, and the People who had &s;o long had the Benefit of their high Intere&s;t &s;hould be &s;till &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the World, and all Mankind's E&s;tates &s;hould &s;ink in Value, but theirs.</P>
<P>It might have &s;eemed Di&s;tinction e|nough, that they enjoy'd tho&s;e Intere&s;ts Tax-free, which by the &s;everal Acts for
<PB N="39" REF="46">
charging Moneys upon Intere&s;t, others did not; but to keep up the Intere&s;t of the Publick Moneys when the Intere&s;t of all private Ca&s;h was &s;unk by Act of Parliament, was an Inequality which no Body knew how to account for, except that &s;ome People &s;aid it was Politically done to keep the lending People in Hu|mour, lea&s;t they might have Occa&s;ion for them again.</P>
<P>As to the Ju&s;tice of it, I know loud Clamours have been made by the Peo|ple concern'd, upon the Notion of ha|ving parted with their Money, on <HI>&s;uch and &s;uch</HI> expre&s;s <HI>Conditions;</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay nothing more to the <HI>&V;nalterablene&s;s</HI> of the Conditions than <HI>as before,</HI> that if the Parliament made Conditions with them, with this particular Capitulation, that they &s;hould be <HI>unalterable,</HI> they did what they had no Power to do. But I go back to the Rea&s;on, the Cau&s;e, and the Nature of tho&s;e Conditions&punc; They had 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> becau&s;e 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> was the law|ful current Intere&s;t of Money in the Na|tion, and they might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be able to make &s;o much of their Money any where el&s;e, at lea&s;t upon per&s;onal Security; for <HI>&s;uch</HI> Government Securities mu&s;t all be cla&s;s'd with tho&s;e which we
<PB N="40" REF="47">
call Per&s;onal; the meaning of this was, that they were to have National lawful Intere&s;t; but no Man can think, I &s;ay, that they were not to ri&s;e or fall in their Intere&s;t, as the lawful Intere&s;t of Money &s;hould ri&s;e or fall: For Example.</P>
<P>Had the Circum&s;tances of this Nati|on, upon what Account &s;oever, oblig'd the Parliament to have rais'd the Inte|re&s;t of Money to 10 <HI>per Cent,</HI> as it was in former Times; I de&s;ire to know what the&s;e Gentlemen, who had lent their Money on Parliament Securities and Funds, would have &s;aid, if they had been the only Per&s;ons who &s;hould have been left to make 4 <HI>per. Cent</HI> of their Money le&s;s than other People: How loudly would they have complain'd of the Ingratitude of the Government, who took their Money at the common In|tere&s;t of the Day when they wanted the Loan, and when 't was a Service to the Nation to lend it, and &s;hould now take no care that they &s;hould be upon an e|qual Foot of Intere&s;t with other People, but &s;hould take the Advantage of the Letter of their Contract, and tye them down to receive but 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for their E&s;tates, when all other People, even tho&s;e that had done them no Service,
<PB N="41" REF="48">
were at Liberty to make &s;o much greater an Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> how full of Rea&s;onings would they have been upon the Equity of the Ca&s;e, that tho' 'twas true they did lend their Money at 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> with &s;ome little Advantage for Encouragement, it was becau&s;e the current Intere&s;t of Money was then no higher, and every Man that lent Money expected no more in Ca&s;es of other Loans: That the Va|lue of Money was &s;o rated at that time by Law; and they &s;tood upon a level in the Rate of their E&s;tates with other Men, but that they could not be &s;up|po&s;ed to lend their Money to the Go|vernment, which was an act of Service to their Country; and be forgotten, when a general Alteration of the Face of Things &s;hould happen, which might be to their Advantage; that it would be very unju&s;t, that others &s;hould be allow'd to make 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> of their Money, and that they only &s;hould be the Men who &s;hould &s;uffer, and &s;it &s;till, and &s;ee their E&s;tates made wor&s;e than other Mens, only becau&s;e they had lent them to the Government, and had run the hazard of them for the Publick Service; that all &s;uch Loans were made by the Rule of
<PB N="42" REF="49">
the Laws, and that the Intere&s;t of their Money was &s;tated by the Rate of Money at <HI>that time;</HI> but not to be tyed down, &s;o as that the Rate of their Money &s;hould not ri&s;e, when the Value of o|ther Mens Money &s;hould ri&s;e; or that they &s;hould not be kept on a level with the re&s;t of the Nation, as they were when they lent their Money.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Rea&s;onings had not been ad|mitted, they would have <HI>gone on with them</HI> THUS: That if their Demand of a higher Intere&s;t, in Proportion to what new Loans were made at, <HI>was not ad|mitted,</HI> they de&s;ir'd they might have their Principal Money paid them back again, that at lea&s;t they might be at Li|berty to make the be&s;t of their E&s;tates in common with other People; that this was but common Ju&s;tice, and that to deny them this would look like taking Advantage of them, as if the Govern|ment had catch'd them, and would hold them; a thing below the Honour of the Publick, and which would make Men cautious for the future how they dealt with them at all; that in Effect it would de&s;troy the Publick Credit, make the Mini&s;try be look'd upon like Sharpers, that would draw the Subjects in to make
<PB N="43" REF="50">
a Prey of them, and not give them the due Con&s;truction of their Circum&s;tan|ces, according to the Nature of things; that to borrow their Money at a low Intere&s;t, and then rai&s;e the lawful Inte|re&s;t of Money in general, was a BITE upon the Lenders; and the Govern|ment might now take the &s;ame Money, and lend it back again, even to &s;ome of the &s;ame Per&s;ons; or if not the &s;ame, to others, and &s;o get 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> by them, which would be the mo&s;t &s;candalous way of tricking Mankind that ever was heard of; that certainly they had a Right to in&s;i&s;t upon being allow'd the com|mon lawful Intere&s;t of Money, and be put upon an Equality with their Neigh|bours, or to have their Money paid them back again, that they might make the be&s;t of it as other Men did of theirs; that if the Intere&s;t had fallen, as well as it was ri&s;en, there was no doubt but the Government would have thought it ve|ry ju&s;t to have oblig'd them to fall with it, or if they had refu&s;ed, would have order'd them to be paid off, that Money at a lower Intere&s;t might have been borrow'd in the room of it; and that therefore they could not but in&s;i&s;t upon it, that they &s;hould be either put upon a
<PB N="44" REF="51">
level with the re&s;t of the People, in ha+ving their Intere&s;t rais'd, or be paid back their Money and &s;ent about their Bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It cannot be call'd begging the Que|&s;tion, to &s;tate the Rever&s;e of the Ca&s;e in this manner, &s;eeing the thing is &s;o natural that the Force of the Argu|ment is &s;carce to be re&s;i&s;ted; in the mean time let it &s;tand as it is, <HI>(viz.)</HI> an Appeal to all the World, for the Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Sugge&s;tion; and there is &s;carce a Man in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> who, if he would impartially turn the Tables, would not allow that the&s;e would be the Arguments to be u&s;ed in that Ca&s;e: Why then the &s;ame way of Rea&s;oning &s;hall not be good in the pre|&s;ent Matter, I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on to determine. Let every Man judge as his own Thoughts &s;hall guide him; but let them be impartial, and &s;peak of it as if they were not concern'd in the Parti|culars; for there is always a great Dif|ference between our Freedom of argu|ing when the Ca&s;e is our own, and when it is perfectly indifferent, and we are not concern'd one way or other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Ju&s;tice of Lowering the Intere&s;t of Money in general, and what may be the Advantage of it at this Time.</HEAD>
<P>LOwering the Intere&s;t of Money is a Ju&s;tice due to Trade, and is judg'd a Credit to the Nation when it can be done, as the ju&s;t Con&s;equence of Wealth and Plenty. It is a Help to that great and u&s;eful Article of <HI>Home-Trade</HI> call'd Per&s;onal Credit; and, in general, is a great Rea&s;on to draw money'd Men in|to Adventures, Undertakings, and u&s;eful Embarking them&s;elves and their Stocks in Manufactures, Di&s;coveries, Planting Colonies, and all the Methods of ex|tending Commerce.</P>
<P>For the&s;e and many other Rea&s;ons it has always been e&s;teem'd the Honour and Advantage of a Nation to reduce the Intere&s;t of their Money, as often and as low as Circum&s;tances would ad|mit: We need go no fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ther than our own dear-bought Experience to prove this, how offering large Premiums and high Intere&s;t, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of 7 and 8 <HI>per Cent.</HI> with Lotteries; the Allurement of high Prizes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> brought Men by Degrees
<PB N="46" REF="53">
to draw their Money out of Trade at the Beginning of the late fir&s;t War, to the irrecoverable Decay of Paper and per&s;onal Credit, and the irreparable In|jury of Trade; which, however it may on &s;ome Occa&s;ions have reviv'd, is yet contracted in fewer Hands by many than it was before, which in it &s;elf is an In|jury &s;carce to be recover'd in &s;ome Ages of Time.</P>
<P>Money is now flowing in private Hands, in&s;omuch that we find the Re|duction of Intere&s;t to 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> is not &s;ufficient, and the <HI>Bank, Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, and other Bodies of Men, make their Advantage of it, taking in great Sums of Money daily at 3 and 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and may have even what Sums they plea&s;e at that rate of Intere&s;t. This loudly calls upon the Government to cau&s;e the national lawful Intere&s;t of Mo|ney to &s;ink another Step.</P>
<P>While it is otherwi&s;e, 'tis evident, Foreigners pour in their Money upon us, and lend us Money at 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and buy our Funds at 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, with Money which, tho' they borrow at home, they pay but 2 and a half or 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for; &s;o that we are made to
<PB N="47" REF="54">
pay Intere&s;t to all the U&s;urers of <HI>Europe,</HI> and let our Money lye in the Bank, and o|ther Places, at little or no Intere&s;t at all. Again, if the Public &s;hall &s;ee fit to do Trade this piece of Ju&s;tice, as to reduce U&s;ury to 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> can any Man think it &s;hould be ju&s;t, that old Loans &s;hould remain di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the re&s;t, and receive 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> or 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> as many do, by which their Principal Sums would advance in Sale, to 23, or 24 Years Purcha&s;e, which were bought of the Government, at 14, 15, and 16 Years Purcha&s;e; at wor&s;t, they could but de&s;ire to be plac'd as they now &s;tand, <HI>(viz.)</HI> at one <HI>per Cent.</HI> above the Common Rate of the National Intere&s;t, and receive five <HI>per Cent.</HI> while other People receiv'd but four; but of that in its order.</P>
<P>In the next Place, we &s;hould do well to enquire what is the Rea&s;on, why the low'ring of National Current Intere&s;t for Money is not complain'd of, as an in|jurious and unju&s;t thing; &s;eeing it is an Arbitrary Inva&s;ion of every Man's Property, taking away &s;o much of his dai|ly, or yearly Sub&s;i&s;tence, without giving any Rea&s;on for it, or Equivalent to it; and is neither better or wor&s;e, than
<PB N="48" REF="55">
dipping into the Per&s;onal E&s;tates of private People, and taking away a part of the Capital.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o no que&s;tion, but it is Grievous, and even Ruinous to many poor Families, and e&s;pecially ancient People, who have nothing left them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, but the Intere&s;t of a little Money, plac'd out by the Parents, or Husbands, who left it them, and by which they now live well enough, but will be brought to Mi&s;ery for the want of it.</P>
<P>Yet the Reduction of Intere&s;t is &s;o known, &s;o unconte&s;ted a Good to the Nation in general, and &s;o eminent a Proof of the Pro&s;perity of the Publick, that, generally &s;peaking, no body op|po&s;es or repines at it; every one &s;eems pleas'd at it on the Publick Account, whether they are &s;o on their own Pri|vate Accounts or no; or at lea&s;t it is &s;o general a Good that none cares to be found oppo&s;ing it. U&s;ury is the Sub|ject of univer&s;al Hatred and Aver&s;ion, and no Man cares to be the Advocate of a Cau&s;e which has &s;o few Friends.</P>
<P>If lowering the Intere&s;t of Money is then a receiv'd Good to the Publick, I cannot doubt but it will as ea&s;ily be
<PB N="49" REF="56">
accepted by tho&s;e who have lent their Money on publick Security, as by tho&s;e who have lent it on Private; I am &s;ure the Ju&s;tice is the &s;ame, and the In|va&s;ion of Property is the &s;ame, and no more; it being a real Sinking the Value of every Man's E&s;tate, in one as well as in another; and no Rea&s;on can be given for the One, but will hold good for the Other.</P>
<P>The Advantages of lowering the Inte|re&s;t of Money at this Time, are too ma|ny to be contain'd in the narrow Com|pa&s;s of the&s;e Sheets, and requires a large Volume to &s;et them out in their ju&s;t De|&s;cription; but I &s;hall name a few:</P>

<ITEM>4. A&s;&s;i&s;ting to pay off the heavy Debt which the Nation now groans under, without farther charging the poor Peo|ple with more Taxes, and without grie|vous and oppre&s;&s;ive Projects: That the Taxes which now lye on the Nation to the Ruine of the Trade, and impoveri&s;h|ing the People, may be taken off, and the Nation may Once more be &s;aid to be <HI>truly free;</HI> which can never be, while they are in Bondage to U&s;ury, and mu&s;t pay &s;ixty Millions Intere&s;t to di&s;charge a Debt of ten Millions Principal, as is the ca&s;e of the Annuities of 99 Years.</ITEM>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of applying the Intere&s;t, which &s;hall be abated from the Loans, to a &s;peedy Di&s;|charge of the Funds.</HEAD>
<P>I Propos'd at the entering upon this Di&s;|cour&s;e, to have &s;aid nothing of what &s;hall or &s;hall not, may or may not be done with the Money, which on a Re|bating the Intere&s;t of publick Money due on Loans, &s;hall be done with the Over|plus which the Funds produce; but the Publick Di&s;cour&s;e on the&s;e Heads makes it nece&s;&s;ary: Various Opinions &s;pread the Town on the&s;e Subjects, and wonderful Speculations of Wi&s;dom occu|py the Politicians of the&s;e Times: Mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;peaking as they hear, or as they fear, or as they de&s;ire to have it be, but few weighing the Cau&s;es, Con&s;equen|ces, and Nature of the Thing it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some are of the Opinion, this Over|plus &s;hould be immediately apply'd to the Service of the Year, to avoid putting the Nation upon farther Exigencies, and
<PB N="52" REF="59">
contracting farther Debts; this, they &s;ay, is equally &s;erviceable, to the paying off the old Taxes, and that while fre&s;h Occa&s;ions pre&s;s the Nation, and call for new Sums every Year, it would be prepo&s;terous to pay off old Debts ju&s;t on Purpo&s;e to contract new. But it is to be hop'd, the pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities of the Govern|ment will not always continue; the Re|bellion is &s;uppre&s;s'd, and the Rebels re|duc'd to Rage and De&s;peration: The Storm they have endeavour'd to rai&s;e Abroad for this Year, is yet only &s;o in Per&s;pective, and may perhaps be pre|vented by the Vigilance and Care of the Government; and the World has &s;carce another Quarter from whence any ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions can be rais'd; and then it may be rea&s;onable to apply the Money to the Abatement of the old Capital Debt: But to do it now, is nothing but putting Money into the Pocket with one Hand, to take it out with the other; and by rai&s;ing new Funds, and making new Appropriations, to multiply Expences of Management, Charges of Collection, and other hateful Burthens upon the People.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="60">
Before I go any farther, I &s;hould rea|dily give in to this Propo&s;al, were it not that, as is ob&s;erv'd, the Taxes already appropriated, are &s;uch, and &s;o grievous to the poor People, and particularly to Trade, that they are in&s;upportable; and will, if not &s;pee|dily taken o&s;t, be fatal not only to our trading People, &s;uch as are men|tion'd before, but even to <HI>Trade it &s;elf:</HI> And this Nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;pee|dy removing tho&s;e Taxes, becau&s;e of their grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive Na|ture, is &s;uch as really admits of no Delay, and is much greater than that of finding other Funds for new Oc|ca&s;ions, as might be demon&s;trated by many Things too long to enu|merate. But to proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2. Some agreeing to the Nece&s;&s;ity of taking off the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive Taxes, and re|lieving the poor indu&s;trious trading Peo|ple by an immediate Act of Parliamen|tary Grace, are for pa&s;&s;ing an Act of Parliament to di&s;&s;olve at once the &s;eve|ral Duties upon Coals, Salt, Candles, Soap, Leather, and all tho&s;e Things which oppre&s;s the Trade and the Poor to
<PB N="54" REF="61">
&s;uch a Degree as has been &s;aid; and to pa&s;s one general Parliamentary Credit for the whole Sum: Cau&s;ing <HI>Exchequer</HI> Bills, or &s;uch Bills of Credit as &s;hall be thought fit, to be given for the Money: All Deficien|cies to be made good by Parliament, and the Credit of Parliament to be the general Fund. To an&s;wer all po&s;&s;ible Objecti|ons again&s;t the Want of an appropriated Revenue, they ask this Que&s;tion, that &s;eeing all Funds are redeemable, all Acts repealable, and every Settlement in Par|liament is by the Con&s;titution liable to &s;uch Alterations, Amendments, and even Di&s;&s;olutions, as the Parliament &s;hall at any Time think fit; the making one general Parliamentary Act of Credit &s;erve to &s;upport the whole Payment, is as e&s;|&s;entially &s;ecure as any appropriated Fund can be; and this, with one Advantage which hitherto has been little con&s;ider'd, <HI>(viz)</HI> The abating the Expence of Collecti|on, Management, Circulation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which a|mounts to an immen&s;e Sum every Year, all paid out of the Pocket of the Poor, and all adding to the Burthen already in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>This is a Propo&s;al in it &s;elf lyable to &s;ome Exception, and requires many
<PB N="55" REF="62">
Things to be &s;aid to clear it from Ob|jections, and yet is in the main, what might effectually an&s;wer the End propo|&s;ed, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to pay off the Debts by ju&s;t Degrees, yet without continuing the op|pre&s;&s;ive Taxes we &s;peak of, provided &s;uch Ways and Means may be found out to levy the Money yearly, without &s;uch particular Taxes as have already caus'd &s;uch ju&s;t and heavy Complaints among the People.</P>
<P>Yet this mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that the Parliament engaging them&s;elves and the Publick Faith for the Payment, is in it &s;elf e&s;&s;entially as &s;afe as any Fund, which the Parliament is able to repeal and di&s;&s;olve; and this is all I &s;hall &s;ay to it here.</P>
<P N="3">3. Others, and tho&s;e &s;upported by the more immediate Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing it &s;elf, enter upon ju&s;t Cal|culations of the proportion'd le&s;&s;ening the Debt in general, by applying the one <HI>per Cent.</HI> which then would remain as a Sur|plus upon the Funds, to paying off the principal Debts, by yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly Payments; and which, by their Calculations, would di&s;charge the whole
<PB N="56" REF="63">
Debt within Twenty two Years to come.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s this Application of the Intere&s;t to the Di&s;charge of the Principal is a Method liable to the lea&s;t Exception, of any Propo&s;al that I have yet met with, or that I have heard others have yet thought; for if the Reduction of Intere&s;t is ju&s;t, and the Parliament think it rea&s;onable to order it to be done, no|thing can be more ju&s;t, than that the Money &s;hould be appropriated to di&s;|ing the principal Debt.</P>
<P>The two only Que&s;tions that occur here, are as follow: And both are, I think, fully &s;poken to already, <HI>(viz.)</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Whether the Parliament can rea&s;o|nably le&s;&s;en the Intere&s;t?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether they can ju&s;tly oblige them to take their Principal?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I &s;ay, the&s;e two are fully &s;poken to al|ready, and I could wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;ome calm Rea&s;ons brought, and in a friendly Manner debated, to convince rea&s;onable People that it is otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But to give the Adver&s;ary fair Play, and to take them every Way, even by
<PB N="57" REF="64">
their own Preten&s;ions, that all Objection may be &s;o far remov'd, and every Mouth &s;topp'd that would open it &s;elf again&s;t relieving the poor oppre&s;s'd Subjects of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> I &s;ay, to &s;top their Mouths, and, for Argument Sake, leaving the re&s;t to future Debates, let us take tho&s;e only which they call, (however improper|ly and non&s;en&s;ically) redeemable Funds.</P>
<P>The Redemption of the&s;e they cannot have the lea&s;t Objection again&s;t; and they have no more to do than to come into &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions to the Govern|ment for the &s;aid Redemption, as the Na|ture of the Thing calls for, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to re|ceive &s;uch Intere&s;t for their Money as the Parliament &s;hall think fit to make the equal Current national Intere&s;t, whether 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> or 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and to &s;ub|&s;cribe their A&s;&s;ent to doing &s;o. In which Ca&s;e, their Money to remain 'till the Surplus, out of the pre&s;ent Intere&s;t, &s;hall come to pay them off in Cour&s;e. Or that &s;uch as &s;hall refu&s;e, to have their Principal &s;o paid off, may have their Sums transferr'd to &s;uch Sub&s;cribers as are willing to pay their Money on the Terms which the other refu&s;e; enough of whom will be ea&s;ily found, when no other Way of
<PB N="58" REF="65">
lending Money upon a higher Intere&s;t &s;hall be allow'd.</P>
<P>It is true, this to be done immedi|ately, and the&s;e Funds di&s;charg'd, would immediately give &s;ome Ea&s;e to the op|pre&s;s'd Nation, by taking off the &s;aid Taxes from the Poor, and by giving the People &s;ome Breathing-time; and let the Parliament alone to a&s;&s;ert their Right, again&s;t tho&s;e who pretend to what they call Funds <HI>Unredeemable.</HI> If they can carry their Point, if they can maintain that Piece of unparliamentary <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Commons, and per&s;wade the Nation that they ought to receive 6 and &frac34; <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, when all the per&s;onal E&s;tates in the Kingdom are oblig'd to take but 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and that the People of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;hall go on to pay Extortion to them for 85 Years to come, 'till they have paid, as is &s;aid above, 60 Millions Intere&s;t for 10 Mil|lions Principal; I &s;ay, if they think they can per&s;wade the Parliament to this, they mu&s;t try what they can do.</P>
<P>But the Nation will never be brought to think, but that it is very hard to have the Current Intere&s;t of Money reduc'd,
<PB N="59" REF="66">
and the&s;e Men enjoy an Exception that &s;hall immediately rai&s;e their Annuities to 24 Years Purcha&s;e; while tho&s;e equally &s;ecur'd, (as to the Goodne&s;s of the Fund) are reduc'd to a Parr. And this brings me to the Great, and yet unexamined Article, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Equality of Tax|ing.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="60" REF="67">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of Equality of Taxes, and the Ju&s;tice due to the People in directing Taxes, &s;o as that no Part be oppre&s;t, but every Part of the People charg'd by &s;uch ju&s;t Proportions as may make the Bur|then be born without Injury to one ano|ther.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not the lea&s;t Part of the Tru&s;t re|po&s;ed by the People of <HI>England</HI> in the Brea&s;ts of their Repre&s;entatives, that they &s;hould be duly and <HI>equally</HI> tax'd: That every Burthen be laid with ju&s;t Regard to the Strength of the Shoulders that &s;upport it. But I wi&s;h it might be &s;aid that it has been, as it ought to be, the con&s;tant Care of the Repre&s;entative, that Burthens are always <HI>thus laid.</HI> Had this been duly con&s;ider'd, I cannot think that many of tho&s;e cruel and unequal Taxes, which pinch and afflict tho&s;e Peo|ple chiefly who are lea&s;t able to &s;upport Taxes, had been entail'd upon us.</P>
<P>We hope, from the Ju&s;tice of the pre|&s;ent Parliament, and the natural Tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="61" REF="68">
and Clemency of King <HI>George,</HI> (the common Father of his People) that they will concur with this Maxim; that every Member of the Body Politick &s;hould be burthen'd with the common Weights of the Government, in Proportion to their Strength of bearing them; that they may draw equally in the &s;ame Yoke, and that the united Strength may thereby be in|creas'd and made &s;tronger.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid &s;omething to this already, but it needs explaining, with Re&s;pect to the &s;everal Ways of the common People being tax'd with the Gentry and Nobili|ty in this Nation. In laying Taxes, this is true, tho' perhaps not a regularly de|termin'd Ob&s;ervation; When Land is Tax'd, the Rich pay more than the Poor; but when the Product of Land is tax'd, <HI>the Poor</HI> pay more than <HI>the Rich.</HI></P>
<P>In explaining this duly, perhaps &s;ome Things may offer to our Con&s;ideration which have not often occurr'd before. Let us therefore look more narrowly into it: The Rich pay for their Land becau&s;e they have it; the Poor pay for their daily Nece&s;&s;aries, becau&s;e they have them not. This is a terrible Inequality. For Example: A Rich Man brews his
<PB N="62" REF="69">
own Beer, becau&s;e he has Money, he has Ve&s;&s;els, he has Conveniencies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and on this Account he pays no Exci&s;e. The poor Man is oblig'd to buy of the Brewer, or perhaps wor&s;e, of the Victu|aller, becau&s;e he has no Money to buy it fa&s;ter than his Thir&s;t pre&s;&s;es him, or in but &s;mall Casks and Quantities; and for this Want of Money he pays Exci&s;e: And thus of many other Things.</P>
<P>Again, the rich Man eats no more Food, burns no more Coals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than a poor Man; nay, if he is a trading Man, as de&s;crib'd before, perhaps not &s;o much: A Tax upon Provi&s;ions then, is equal, literally &s;peaking, to the Poor, as to the Rich; but very unequal, in Proportion to their Capacity of paying it.</P>
<P>A Tax in <HI>England</HI> upon the Nece&s;&s;ities of Life, is &s;omething like the <HI>Taille</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> which no Gentleman is to pay; 'tis true, ours pay in &s;ome Ca&s;es, but, ge|nerally &s;peaking, tho&s;e who live on their own E&s;tates, and eat the Produce of their own Lands, pay little or nothing to them. Now the difference lyes here, that the <HI>Taille</HI> is in <HI>France,</HI> where the Poor are to be Poor, and the Common
<PB N="63" REF="70">
People are Slaves, and are u&s;ed as &s;uch. But this is in <HI>England,</HI> where we pre|tend to value our &s;elves upon making the Common People Ea&s;y, Free, and their Lives comfortable; where we have always been u&s;ed to &s;ay the Poor paid nothing, where the Commons have their Liberties, and claim to be well u&s;ed; where Equalities in Taxing is boa&s;ted of, as the Care of the Publick, and e|very one is made able to pay what is Demanded of them. Equalities cea&s;e to merit their Name, when, whatever their appearance may be, they pre&s;s har|der upon one part than upon another. But what &s;hall we &s;ay to tho&s;e things, which under the Title of Equalities pre&s;s hard upon tho&s;e who are lea&s;t able to bear them, and pa&s;s tho&s;e by who are really incapable of being Oppre&s;s'd by them.</P>
<P>The Rich feel none of tho&s;e Taxes, by which the Poor are made mi&s;erable; and upon the Con&s;ideration of this it is that the Repre&s;entatives of this Nati|on always avoided either Taxing the meaner People, or el&s;e Taxed them &s;o lightly, as that they might be able to
<PB N="64" REF="71">
pay their Charge without Injury to their Sub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>It was &s;een for &s;ome Years from the fir&s;t beginning of the War after the Revolution, that great Sums were want|ing for the publick Occa&s;ions, and the Mini&s;try but ill vers'd in the methods of rai&s;ing tho&s;e Sums; yet the Parliament always rejected tho&s;e Propo&s;als, which &s;eemed to pinch the Poorer part of the Nation. Nay, they fail'd not to repeal and di&s;&s;olve &s;everal Taxes after they were laid, upon the Petition of the People, when they found them offen&s;ive to the Poor, and Injurious to Trade or to the Manufactures, &s;uch as the fir&s;t Tax upon Coals, the fir&s;t Tax upon Paper, the Duties on Gla&s;s, Earthen Ware, Tobacco Pipes, the Duties on Marriages, Births and Burials, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When they Taxt the Lands they laid it all upon the Landlord, none upon the Tenant; when they Taxt Stock, they Taxt Stock of Trade&s;men and Shop|keepers, but no Stock upon Land, and afterwards left off even the Stock of Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>Such was the ju&s;t Concern which the Re|pre&s;entatives of this Nation &s;hew'd to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="65" REF="72">
the Equality and ju&s;t Proportions of Taxes, mea&s;uring the Burthen by the Condition of tho&s;e that were to bear it; and this was without que&s;tion the Foun|dation of that generous Confidence the People of <HI>England</HI> always had in their Repre&s;entatives, and made them always give them&s;elves up, &s;o entirely and with|out re&s;erve, to whatever was determin'd in Parliament, bearing every Burthen with the utmo&s;t Re&s;ignation if laid on by Parliament, however afflicting grievous or ruinous in its Con&s;equence it might be, till they even &s;ink beneath the Weight.</P>
<P>For I know not by what Fate it has been upon the Nation, we have not all the fine things to &s;ay of late upon the&s;e Heads that we had before; whether it is that the Exigence has been greater, or the Care for the mea&s;ure of Burthens le&s;s. But as if the Poor, the Commerce, the Manufacturer, the general Outcrys of the People, had been of no Weight in the Ca&s;e, &s;ome of our late&s;t Taxes have &s;eem|ed to have been laid on with le&s;s Con|cern for the People, le&s;s Ju&s;tice in the Proportions, and le&s;s Con&s;ideration of the Con&s;equences, than tho&s;e I have &s;poken of above.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="73">
As the Effect of this want of Care, we find tho&s;e things Tax'd of late, which at fir&s;t they would have &s;corn'd to touch; and heavy Duties laid, which it was cer|tain would pinch and oppre&s;s the Poor and the Trade more than others: Things which formerly were &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons why &s;uch Taxes were always rejected.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, they were driven to tho&s;e things by the Exigence of the Times, and by the Poverty of Funds; it is an&s;wer'd, That would be a better Rea&s;on, if there was more Truth to &s;upport it. But on the contrary, we &s;ee many Funds have been propo&s;ed, which have been de|clin'd, and many more might yet be found to &s;ave the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Poor, and avoid laying Burthens.</P>
<P>But to avoid the grand Debate with Stock-jobbers and Projectors, the An&s;wer is always at hand, The Parliament is a <HI>Fund</HI> of <HI>FUNDS;</HI> and therefore, as I &s;aid before, were all the pre&s;ent Taxes given up to the People, the Security for the Money lent is the &s;ame, and the Hou&s;e would be oblig'd every Year to rai&s;e a Sum of three Millions of Money to be paid by Quarterly Payments, till the
<PB N="67" REF="74">
Intere&s;t and Principal of the pre&s;ent En|cumbrances was fully paid off.</P>
<P>Nor can the Parliament be at a lo&s;s to do this, unle&s;s &s;ome far more pre&s;|&s;ing Demands come upon them than yet are, or we hope will be likely to come; and tho' this Work is not de&s;ign'd as a Scheme of Projections, yet I may &s;ay a Word or two to likely Foundations for rai&s;ing any Sum of Money that the Go|vernment may want for &s;o great and glorious Ends, as tho&s;e of clearing the Nation of the pre&s;ent in&s;upportable Bur|then of Debt, and of Oppre&s;&s;ive Taxes which it labours under.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this Article of <HI>Equali|ties</HI> in Taxing, without mentioning with great Regret the <HI>&s;candalous Inequality,</HI> which is the Foundation of &s;o much Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice on one hand, and of &s;o much Deficiency to the Nation on the other, in the Collecting our Great and Capital Tax call'd the LAND-TAX; a Tax rai&s;ed with &s;o much di&s;|proportion, that, to &s;ay no more, 2<HI>s.</HI> in the Pound regularly and equally Col|lected, would certainly rai&s;e the full Sum that 4<HI>s.</HI> in the Pound now rai&s;es; or 4<HI>s.</HI> in the Pound compleatly and equally
<PB N="68" REF="75">
Collected, would rai&s;e near double the Sum which has been annually rai&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>Had this Tax been Collected as it ought to have been, and Two Milli|ons <HI>per Ann.</HI> been rai&s;ed by it more than has been, the Debt of the Nation had been le&s;s by above 20 Millions than now it is, and yet the Landed Men had paid no more than they now pretend to have paid.</P>
<P>When we talk of the Landed Men, and what they have done, what large Efforts they have made, and how heavy the Burthen of the War has lain upon them, do we not &s;ay in their behalf that the Landed Men have paid a fifth part of their Annual Income to the War? But how do the Gentlemen of Two Thirds of <HI>England</HI> &s;mile at us, or laugh in their Sleeves (as the common way of expre&s;&s;ing is,) when they accept that Compliment, and know very well that it has not co&s;t &s;ome of them 16<HI>d. per Pound</HI> and others not a Shilling in the Pound, and where it has come highe&s;t is not one with another above 2<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d. per Pound.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="76">
While in the <HI>Midland,</HI> and &s;ome Sou|thern Counties, the Severities have been Great, and the People have paid the ut|mo&s;t Penny, nay, <HI>in &s;ome places</HI> 4<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per</HI> Pound. A review of this &s;candalous Inequality would be a Work worthy a Parliament that de&s;ir'd to be recorded for the Deliverers of their Country from in&s;uperable Debts; but of this again in its place.</P>

<P>IF <HI>Equality in Taxing</HI> be thus the Care and Concern of Parliaments, a Tru&s;t committed to the Repre&s;entatives by the People of <HI>England,</HI> whom they repre|&s;ent, <HI><HI>&amp;c.</HI></HI> what then have &s;ome Parlia|ments in times by-pa&s;t been doing? and how have they di&s;charged this great Tru&s;t placed in them by the People? &s;eeing we find the Nation groaning un|der a Weight of the mo&s;t &s;candalous INEQUALITIES in Taxing that can be imagined, &s;uch as are indeed the Cau&s;e of the va&s;t Debt we are now load|ed with, and the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Oppre&s;|&s;ive Funds, which are now entail'd up|on us, and our Po&s;terity: The&s;e are<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>The Land Tax,</HI> mention'd already; which, had it been duly and equally Rated and Collected, would all a|long have rais'd four Millions in|&s;tead of two, and &s;aved the Hou&s;e
<PB N="71" REF="78">
of Commons the Trouble of rai&s;ing Two Millions more every Year, by a &s;candalous Anticipation, or by Loan upon &s;ome of tho&s;e heavy Taxes we complain of.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The freeing all the publick Funds from being Taxt, &s;o that whatever Exigence their Country was reduced to, whatever Taxes the poorer &s;ort of People paid, the&s;e Men alone enjoy'd an Exemption for the great|e&s;t part of the ready Money in the Nation, tho' at the &s;ame time they receiv'd one <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t more for it, than other People are allow'd to make of their Money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Difference of Intere&s;t of Mo|ney, as is &s;aid; an Inequality unju&s;t in its own Nature, or el&s;e the Act of Parliament for Reducing the Inte|re&s;t of Money to 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> mu&s;t be unju&s;t, which I will not &s;ugge&s;t upon any account whatever.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Not content with the&s;e Advantages di&s;tinct from other Men, we find them now claiming an Inequality which would be indeed Exorbitant in its own Nature; and which we do not &s;ee, I &s;ay, we do not &s;ee the
<PB N="72" REF="79">
Act of Parliament entitles them to, <HI>viz.</HI> that the re&s;t of their Inequa|lities are unalterable, and that the Parliament it &s;elf cannot redeem the Funds they have lent their Mo|ney upon.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t &s;evere of all Inequa|lities, and &s;erves very well to &s;et forth the Evil Con&s;equences of the re&s;t; for if this be &s;o, the Nation is bound to pay them an immen&s;e and prodigious Sum for Intere&s;t of a Debt which they are ready to di&s;charge, when all the re&s;t of the World are obliged, not only not to give, but indeed not to receive &s;uch a rate of Intere&s;t for their Money.</P>
<P>It is hard to imagine, what any &s;in|gle Man or body of Men can &s;ay in De|fence of &s;uch an Unju&s;t and Unequal Treatment of the People of <HI>England.</HI> The mo&s;t that I have met with, from the mo&s;t Arrogant on the other &s;ide, is, that it was their Bargain; it was the Condition on which they lent their Money, and that they expect it &s;hould be perform'd; they have the Publick Faith for it, and they expect the Publick Faith &s;hall not be broken with them. I will not &s;ay, as &s;ome however
<PB N="73" REF="80">
do, <HI>and think it is with Ju&s;tice too,</HI> that the Publick Faith is what the Publick plea&s;e to make it: But this I will &s;ay, the Publick Faith is like the Publick Seal. If the Publick Seal, by the Treachery or Ignorance of the Per&s;on to whom it is Entru&s;ted, &s;hould be affixt to a thing which in its Nature is Unju&s;t and Illegal, and which the Publick is not empower'd to Execute, the Action is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> in|valid and will not take place. For Ex|ample, &s;uppo&s;e the Publick Seal be fixt to a Grant of Land in the King's Name, which the King really has no Power to Alienate or Grant, the affixing the Seal &s;hall be of no force, and the Per&s;on &s;o af|fixing it will run the hazard of Cen|&s;ure by proper Judges for the Offence. In like manner, if any Parliament made &s;uch a Bargain as the&s;e Men call it, to give them unju&s;t Advantages and Ine|qualities, and &s;o to entail them; as that future Parliaments &s;hould not be em|power'd to redeem and buy them back again, re&s;toring thereby the ju&s;t Equa|lity in Taxes, which all the People of <HI>England</HI> claim as their undoubted Right; I &s;ay, &s;uch Parliament did what no Parlia|ment had Power to do, the Action was
<PB N="74" REF="81">
void <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> and the pre&s;ent, or any &s;ub&s;equent Parliament may, <HI>and &s;ome I que&s;tion not will,</HI> do Ju&s;tice to the Con|&s;titution, by declaring their Right, and cen&s;uring the Action it &s;elf as Injurious to the Nation.</P>
<P>There are Inequalities in the Taxes them&s;elves, but as the&s;e are &s;poken to under other Heads, I &s;ay no more to them here.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Taking off of Publick Taxes, and the Effect it would have upon Hou&s;e-keeping, Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Man can hardly refrain, after all that has been &s;aid, from flattering the Nation with Hopes, that they &s;hall once more live to &s;ee them&s;elves delive|red from Task-ma&s;ters, and Tax-ga|therers. It is impo&s;&s;ible to think far into &s;uch a thing without &s;ome Rapture, &s;ome little Exta&s;ies upon the Felicities of our Native Country. This would be indeed to ta&s;te the Fruits of Peace, and the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion. This would be the reviving the Halcion Days, and bringing the Golden Age once more upon the Earth. Then it would be no more a Proverb or by-Word among us, that there is nothing &s;ure, but <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Taxes.</HI></P>
<P>Then if Trade did not flouri&s;h, Ma|nufactures go abroad, Navigation en|crea&s;e, the Poor live ea&s;ie, and eve|ry thing go well with us, it mu&s;t be our
<PB N="76" REF="83">
own Fault. Let me but repre&s;ent now to a Manufacturing Weaver or Clothier, who has a Hou&s;e full of Children, and a Shop or Work-room full of Servants, how it will fare with him; he will have his Coals cheaper by 5<HI>s.</HI> a Chaldron, his Malt cheaper by 4<HI>s.</HI> a Quarter, his Bread in all probability cheaper by 2<HI>s.</HI> a Bu&s;hel, his Candles cheaper by 12<HI>d.</HI> a Dozen, his Soap by 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> a Firkin, his Shoes cheaper, his Linnen, his Cal|licoe, and all &s;uch things in proportion; in a Word, a Family that now &s;pends a Hundred Pounds a Year in Hou&s;e-keeping, &s;hall live for Four&s;core, and &s;o above and below them in proportion.</P>
<P>Even the People who&s;e Intere&s;t of Mo|ney is to be abated, may not be &s;uch great Lo&s;ers as they &s;eem to &s;ugge&s;t; for if they lo&s;e &s;omething in their U&s;ury, th y will have it again in the Sub&s;i|&s;tance of their Families, <HI>if they have any.</HI> Suppo&s;e a Man has 2000<HI>l.</HI> in the&s;e Funds for which he received 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> before, and is now reduced to 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> he mu&s;t have but a &s;mall Family, and make but a mean Figure in the World, if by the Abatement of Prices on Food and Cloaths, he does not &s;ave double to his lo&s;s, by
<PB N="77" REF="84">
the taking off tho&s;e Taxes, which he contributes &s;omething to, even by every thing he u&s;es in his Hou&s;e, or wears on his Back, the <HI>home bred</HI> Cattle, and <HI>home Manufacture</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>And where then is the Oppre&s;&s;ion of all this? and what Regard can he be &s;up|po&s;ed to have for his Native Country, that can &s;it &s;till and not rejoyce to &s;ee his poorer Neighbours partake of the &s;ame Deliverance?</P>
<P>Let us Examine, what perhaps few think of in this Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> what Effect it will have upon Trade: Our Trading Politicians tells us, 'tis all one to Trade, for the la&s;t Buyer pays it; the Trade&s;|man neither gets or lo&s;es, it's all one to him cheap or dear, he has his Gain upon what he Sells. But the&s;e are Di&s;cour&s;es which come from the Mouths of none, but tho&s;e who know little of Commerce: There are two Maxims in Trade, which relate to the Dearne&s;s or Cheapne&s;s of Goods.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Dearne&s;s of Goods le&s;&s;ens the Con&s;umption.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Dearne&s;s of Goods devours the Trade&s;man's Stock.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85">
When Wares fall in Price, not only the People con&s;ume more, but the Trade&s;-man can launch farther into Trade, &s;ell more in Value, and make a larger Return in a Year. This not only in|crea&s;es his Profit, but as it is in a pri|vate Man's Shop, &s;o it is inthe general return of the Nation, the Trade is con|tracted, the Con&s;umption is le&s;&s;en'd, and the Demand for Goods &s;horten'd, be|cau&s;e the Price by rea&s;on of high Du|ties is enlarged.</P>
<P>Le&s;&s;ening the Quantity of Goods &s;old, affects abundance of the depending Branches of Trade; for Example, Navi|gation is le&s;&s;en'd, fewer Goods Imported, fewer Ships employ'd to fetch them, fewer Seamen to &s;ail tho&s;e Ships, fewer Trade&s;|men to build, and fit them out; all De|crea&s;es. After Goods are on Shore, Boats, Carriages, Men, Hor&s;es, all feel the Ef|fects of a want of Quantity; &s;o that making Goods dear at Market, <HI>which is the certain effect of all high Impo&s;itions,</HI> Cramps Trade obliges the Trade&s;man to employ more Stock, or return much le&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, it takes away the Employ of multitudes of Families, that are em|ploy'd, as is &s;aid, in removing, fetching and carrying Merchandices from Place to Place.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="86">
Let us look le&s;s on the Melancholy part, and take the happy Rever&s;e: Upon removing the heavy Impo&s;itions, the Cheapne&s;s which will follow of cour&s;e will accordingly encrea&s;e the Con&s;ump|tion of all &s;orts of Goods, as well Foreign Imported Goods, &s;uch as Linnen, Fruit, Spice, Sugar, Tobacco, Wine, Oyl, Silk, Callicoes, Mu&s;lins, Dye Stuffs, Coffee, Tea, Cocoa, and the like, as al&s;o of our home nece&s;&s;aries mention'd already to be &s;o hea|vily Tax'd. By this encreas'd Con&s;ump|tion, Trade will revive of cour&s;e, Na|vigation encrea&s;e, Employment of Men, of Families, of Cattle, of Land, all en|crea&s;es; in a Word, if Taxes were remo|ved, Trade in general would encrea&s;e, Plenty and Cheapne&s;s make Families ea&s;y, and the whole Nation flouri&s;h.</P>
