</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is not a &s;entence in &s;cripture, which &s;trikes a narrow &s;oul with greater a&s;toni&s;hment &mdash; and one might as ea&s;ily engage to clear up the darke&s;t problem in geometry to an ignorant mind, as make a &s;ordid one comprehend the truth and rea&s;onablene&s;s of this plain propo&s;ition. &mdash; No man liveth to him&s;elf! Why &mdash; Does any man live to any thing el&s;e? &mdash; In the whole compa&s;s of human life can a prudent man &s;teer to a &s;afer point? &mdash; Not live to him&s;elf? &mdash; To whom then? &mdash; Can any intere&s;ts or con|cerns
<PB N="2" REF="6">
which are foreign to a man's &s;elf have &s;uch a claim over him, that he mu&s;t &s;erve under them &mdash; &s;u&s;pend his own pur&s;uits &mdash; &s;tep out of his right cour&s;e, till others have pa&s;s'd by him, and attain'd the &s;eve|ral ends and purpo&s;es of living before him?</P>
<P>If, with a &s;elfi&s;h heart, &s;uch an enquirer &s;hould happen to have a &s;peculating head too, he will proceed, and a&s;k you whe|ther this &s;ame principle which the apo&s;tle here throws out of the life of man, is not in fact the grand bias of his nature? &mdash; That however we may flatter our&s;elves with fine-&s;pun notions of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and heroi&s;m in what we do; that were the mo&s;t popular of our actions &s;trip'd naked; and the true motives and intentions of them &s;earch'd to the bottom; we &s;hould
<PB N="3" REF="7">
find little rea&s;on for triumph upon that &s;core. &mdash; </P>
<P>In a word, he will &s;ay, that a man is altogether a bubble to him&s;elf in this mat|ter, and that after all that can be &s;aid in his behalf, the true&s;t definition that can be given of him is this, that he is a &s;elfi&s;h animal; and that all his actions have &s;o &s;trong a tincture of that character, as to &s;hew (to whomever el&s;e he was intended to live) that in fact, he lives only to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Before I reply directly to this accu&s;a|tion, I cannot help ob&s;erving by the way, that there is &s;carce any thing which has done more di&s;&s;ervice to &s;ocial virtue, than the frequent repre&s;entations of human nature, under this hideous picture of de|formity, which by leaving out all that
<PB N="4" REF="8">
is generous and friendly in the heart of man, has &s;unk him below the level of a brute, as if he was a compo&s;ition of all that was mean-&s;pirited and &s;elfi&s;h. Surely, 'tis one &s;tep towards acting well, to think worthily of our nature; and as in com|mon life, the way to make a man hone&s;t, is, to &s;uppo&s;e him &s;o, and treat him as &s;uch; &mdash; &s;o here, to &s;et &s;ome value upon our&s;elves, enables us to &s;upport the cha|racter, and even in&s;pires and adds &s;enti|ments of genero&s;ity and virtue to tho&s;e which we have already preconceived. The &s;cripture tells, That GOD made man in his own image, &mdash; not &s;urely in the &s;en&s;i|tive and corporeal part of him, that could bear no re&s;emblance with a pure and infi|nite &s;pirit, &mdash; but what re&s;emblance he bore was undoubtedly in the moral rectitude, and the kind and benevolent affections of
<PB N="5" REF="9">
his nature. And tho' the brightne&s;s of this image has been &s;ullied greatly by the fall of man, in our fir&s;t parents, and the characters of it rendered &s;till le&s;s legible, by the many &s;uper-inductions of his own depraved appetites &s;ince &mdash; 'yet tis a lau|dable pride and a true greatne&s;s of mind to cheri&s;h a belief, that there is &s;o much of that glorious image &s;till left upon it, as &s;hall re&s;train him from ba&s;e and di&s;grace|ful actions; to an&s;wer which end, what thought can be more conducive than that, of our being made in the likene&s;s of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of beings? This is a plain con&s;equence. And the con&s;ideration of it &s;hould have in &s;ome mea&s;ure been a protection to human nature, from the rough u&s;age &s;he has met with from the &s;atirical pens of &s;o many of the French writers, as well as of our own country, who with more wit than well-meaning
<PB N="6" REF="10">
have de&s;perately fallen foul upon the whole &s;pecies, as a &s;et of creatures incapable ei|ther of private friend&s;hip or public &s;pirit, but ju&s;t as the ca&s;e &s;uited their own in|tere&s;t and advantage.</P>
<P>That there is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and mean|ne&s;s enough in the &s;ouls of one part of the world, to hurt the credit of the other part of it, is what I &s;hall not di&s;pute a|gain&s;t; but to judge of the whole, from this bad &s;ample, and becau&s;e one man is plotting and artful in his nature &mdash; or, a &s;econd openly makes his plea&s;ure or his profit the &s;ole centre of all his de&s;igns &mdash; or becau&s;e a third &s;trait-hearted wretch &s;its confined within him&s;elf, &mdash; feels no misfortunes, but tho&s;e which touch him|&s;elf; to involve the whole race without mercy under &s;uch dete&s;ted characters, is a conclu&s;ion as fal&s;e, as it is pernicious; and
<PB N="7" REF="11">
was it in general to gain credit, could &s;erve no end, but the rooting out of our nature all that is generous, and planting in the &s;tead of it &s;uch an aver&s;ion to each other, as mu&s;t untie the bands of &s;ociety, and rob us of one of the greate&s;t plea|&s;ures of it, the mutual communications of kind offices; and by poi&s;oning the foun|tain, rendering every thing &s;u&s;pected that flows through it.</P>
<P>To the honor of human nature, the &s;cripture teaches us, that God made man upright &mdash; and though he has &s;ince found out many inventions, which have much di&s;honoured this noble &s;tructure, yet the foundation of it &s;tands as it was, &mdash; the whole frame and de&s;ign of it carried on upon &s;ocial virtue and public &s;pirit, and every member of us &s;o evidently &s;upport|ed
<PB N="8" REF="12">
by this &s;trong cement, that we may &s;ay with the apo&s;tle, <HI>that no man liveth to him&s;elf.</HI> In what&s;oever light we view him, we &s;hall &s;ee evidently, that there is no &s;tation or condition of his life, &mdash; no office or relation, or circum&s;tance, but there ari&s;es from it &s;o many ties, &s;o many indi&s;|pen&s;ible claims upon him, as mu&s;t perpe|tually carry him beyond any &s;elfi&s;h con|&s;ideration, and &s;hew plainly, that was a man fooli&s;hly wicked enough to de&s;ign to live to him&s;elf alone, he would either find it impracticable, or he would lo&s;e, at lea&s;t, the very thing which made life it&s;elf de|&s;irable. We know that our creator, like an all-wi&s;e contriver in this, as in all other of his works has implanted in mankind &s;uch appetites and inclinations as were &s;uitable for their &s;tate; that is, &s;uch as would naturally lead him to the love of
<PB N="9" REF="13">
&s;ociety and friend&s;hip, without which he would have been found in a wor&s;e condi|tion than the very bea&s;ts of the field. No one therefore who lives in &s;ociety, can be &s;aid to live to him&s;elf, &mdash; he lives to his GOD, &mdash; to his king, and his country. &mdash; He lives to his family, to his friends, to all under his tru&s;t, and in a word, he lives to the whole race of mankind; what&s;oever has the character of man, and wears the &s;ame image of GOD that he does, is truly his brother, and has a ju&s;t claim to his kindne&s;s. &mdash; That this is the ca&s;e in fact, as well as in theory, may be made plain to any one, who has made any ob|&s;ervations upon human life. &mdash; When we have traced it through all its connecti|ons, &mdash; view'd it under the &s;everal obliga|tions which &s;ucceed each other in a per|petual rotation through the different &s;tages of a ha&s;ty pilgrimage, we &s;hall find that
<PB N="10" REF="14">
the&s;e do operate &s;o &s;trongly upon it, and lay us ju&s;tly under &s;o many re&s;traints, that we are every hour &s;acrificing &s;omething to &s;ociety, in return for the benefits we re|ceive from it.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this, let us take a &s;hort &s;urvey of the life of any one man, (not liable to great exceptions, but &s;uch a life as is common to mo&s;t) let us examine it merely to this point, and try how far it will an&s;wer &s;uch a repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>If we begin with him in that early age, wherein the &s;tronge&s;t marks of undi&s;gui&s;ed tenderne&s;s and di&s;intere&s;ted compa&s;&s;ion &s;hew them&s;elves, &mdash; I might previou&s;ly ob|&s;erve, with what impre&s;&s;ions he is come out of the hands of GOD, &mdash; with the very bias upon his nature, which prepares him
<PB N="11" REF="15">
for the character, which he was de&s;igned to fulfil. &mdash; But let us pa&s;s by the years which denote childhood, as no lawful evidence, you'll &s;ay, in this di&s;pute; let us follow him to the period, when he is ju&s;t got loo&s;e from tutors and governors, when his actions may be argued upon with le&s;s exception. If you ob&s;erve, you will find, that one of the fir&s;t and leading propen&s;i|ties of his nature, is that, which di&s;covers it&s;elf in the de&s;ire of &s;ociety, and the &s;pon|taneous love towards tho&s;e of his kind. And tho' the natural wants and exigen|cies of his condition, are no doubt, one rea&s;on of this amiable impul&s;e, &mdash; GOD ha|ving founded that in him, as a provi&s;ional &s;ecurity to make him &s;ocial. &mdash; Yet tho' it is a rea&s;on in nature, &mdash; 'tis a rea&s;on, to him yet undi&s;cover'd. Youth is not apt to philo&s;ophi&s;e &s;o deeply &mdash; but follows, &mdash; as it feels it&s;elf prompted by the inward work|ings
<PB N="12" REF="16">
of benevolence &mdash; without view to it&s;elf, or previous calculation either of the lo&s;s or profit which may accrue. Agreeably to this, ob&s;erve how warm, how heartily he enters into friend&s;hips, &mdash; how di&s;in|tere&s;ted, and un&s;u&s;picious in the choice of them, &mdash; how generous and open in his profe&s;&s;ions! &mdash; how &s;incere and hone&s;t in making them good! &mdash; When his friend is in di&s;tre&s;s, &mdash; what lengths he will go, &mdash; what hazards he will bring upon him&s;elf, &mdash; what embara&s;&s;ment upon his affairs to ex|tricate and &s;erve him! If man is alto|gether a &s;elfi&s;h creature (as the&s;e morali|&s;ers would make him) 'tis certain he does not arrive at the full maturity of it, in this time of his life. &mdash; No. If he de|&s;erves any accu&s;ation, 'tis in the other ex|tream, <Q REND="inline">"That in his youth he is general|ly more FOOL than KNAVE,"</Q> &mdash; and &s;o far
<PB N="13" REF="17">
from being &s;u&s;pected of living to him&s;elf, that he lives rather to every body el&s;e; the uncon&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of art and de&s;ign in his own intentions, rendering him &s;o ut|terly void of a &s;u&s;picion of it in others, as to leave him too oft a bubble to every one who will take the advantage. &mdash; But you will &s;ay, he &s;oon abates of the&s;e tran&s;ports of di&s;intere&s;ted love; and as he grows older, &mdash; grows wi&s;er, and learns to live more to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let us examine. &mdash; </P>
<P>That a longer knowledge of the world, and &s;ome experience of in&s;ince|rity, &mdash; will teach him a le&s;&s;on of more caution in the choice of friend&s;hips, and le&s;s forwardne&s;s in the undi&s;tingui&s;hed offers of his &s;ervices, is what I grant.
<PB N="14" REF="18">
But if he cools of the&s;e, does he not grow warmer &s;till in connections of a different kind? Follow him, I pray you, into the next &s;tage of life, where he has enter'd into engagements and appears as the father of a family, and, you will &s;ee, the pa&s;&s;ion &s;till remains, &mdash; the &s;tream &s;omewhat more confined, &mdash; but, runs the &s;tronger for it, &mdash; the &s;ame benevolence of heart alter'd only in its cour&s;e, and the difference of objects towards which it tends. Take a &s;hort view of him in this light, as acting under the many tender claims which that relation lays upon him, &mdash; &s;pending many weary days, and &s;leeple&s;s nights &mdash; utterly forgetful of him|&s;elf, &mdash; intent only upon his family, and with an anxious heart contriving and la|bouring to pre&s;erve it from di&s;tre&s;s, a|gain&s;t that hour when he &s;hall be taken
<PB N="15" REF="19">
from its protection. Does &s;uch a one live to him&s;elf? &mdash; He who ri&s;es early, late takes re&s;t, and eats the bread of careful|ne&s;s, to &s;ave others the &s;orrow of doing &s;o after him. Does &s;uch a one live only to him&s;elf? &mdash; Ye who are parents an|&s;wer this que&s;tion for him. How oft have ye &s;acrified your health, &mdash; your ea&s;e, &mdash; your plea&s;ures, &mdash; nay, the very comforts of your lives, for the &s;ake of your child|ren? &mdash; How many indulgencies have ye given up? &mdash; What &s;elf-denials and diffi|culties have ye chearfully undergone for them? &mdash; In their &s;ickne&s;s, or reports of their mi&s;conduct? How have ye <HI>gone on your way &s;orrowing?</HI> What alarms within you, when fancy forebodes but imaginary misfortunes hanging over them? &mdash; but when real ones have overtaken them, <HI>and mi&s;chief befallen them in the way in which</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="20">
<HI>they have gone,</HI> how &s;harper than a &s;word have ye felt the workings of parental kind|ne&s;s? In whatever period of human life we look for proofs of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &mdash; let us not &s;eek them in this relation of a parent, who&s;e whole life, when truly known, is often little el&s;e but a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cares, heart-aches, and di&s;quieting apprehen|&s;ions, &mdash; enough to &s;hew, that he is but an in&s;trument in the hands of GOD to pro|vide for the well-being of others, to &s;erve their intere&s;t as well as his own.</P>
<P>If you try the truth of this rea&s;oning upon every other part or &s;ituation of the &s;ame life, you will find it holds good in one degree or other; take a view of it out of the&s;e clo&s;er connections both of a friend and parent. &mdash; Con&s;ider him for a moment, under that natural alliance, in
<PB N="17" REF="21">
which even a heathen poet has placed him; namely that of <HI>a man:</HI> &mdash; and as &s;uch, to his honor, as one capable of &s;tand|ing unconcern'd, in whatever concerns his fellow creatures. &mdash; Compa&s;&s;ion has &s;o great a &s;hare in our nature, and the mi|&s;eries of this world are &s;o con&s;tant an ex|erci&s;e of it, as to leave it in no one's power (who de&s;erves the name of man) in this re&s;pect, <HI>to live to him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>He cannot &s;top his ears again&s;t the cries of the unfortunate. &mdash; The &s;ad &s;tory of the fatherle&s;s and him that has no hel|per <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be heard. &mdash; <HI>The &s;orrowful &s;ighing of the pri&s;oners will come before him</HI>; and a thou&s;and other untold ca&s;es of di&s;tre&s;s to which the life of man is &s;ubject, find a way to his heart. &mdash; Let intere&s;t guard
<PB N="18" REF="22">
the pa&s;&s;age as it will, <HI>if he has this world's goods, and &s;eeth his brother have need, he will not be able to &s;hut up his bowels of com|pa&s;&s;ion from him.</HI></P>
<P>Let any man of common humanity, look back upon his own life as &s;ubjected to the&s;e &s;trong claims, and recollect the influence they have had upon him. How oft the mere impul&s;es of genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion have led him out of his way? &mdash; In how many acts of charity and kind|ne&s;s, his fellow-feeling for others has made him forget him&s;elf? &mdash; In neigh|bourly offices, how oft he has acted a|gain&s;t all con&s;iderations of profit, conve|nience, nay &s;ometimes even of ju&s;tice it|&s;elf? &mdash; Let him add to this account, how much, in the progre&s;s of his life, has been
<PB N="19" REF="23">
given up even to the le&s;&s;er obligations of civility and good manners? &mdash; What re|&s;traints they have laid him under? How large a portion of his time, &mdash; how much of his inclination and the plan of life he could mo&s;t chu&s;e, has from time to time been made a &s;acrifice, to his good nature and di&s;inclination to give pain or di&s;gu&s;t to others?</P>
<P>Whoever takes a view of the life of man, in this gla&s;s wherein I have &s;hewn it, will find it &s;o be&s;et and hemm'd in with obligations of one kind or other, as to leave little room to &s;u&s;pect, that <HI>man can live to him&s;elf:</HI> and &s;o clo&s;ely has our creator link'd us together, (as well as all other parts of his works) for the pre&s;er|vation of that harmony in the frame and
<PB N="20" REF="24">
&s;y&s;tem of things which his wi&s;dom has at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, &mdash; That we find this bond of mutual dependence, however relax'd, is too &s;trong to be broke, and I believe, that the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h men find it is &s;o, and that they cannot, in fact, live &s;o much to them&s;elves, as the narrowne&s;s of their own hearts incline them. If the&s;e re|flections are ju&s;t upon the moral relations in which we &s;tand to each other, let us clo&s;e the examination with a &s;hort reflec|tion upon the great relation in which we &s;tand to GOD.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural thought on this &s;ubject, which at one time or other will thru&s;t it&s;elf upon every man's mind, is this, &mdash; That there is a GOD who made me, &mdash; to who&s;e gift I owe all the
<PB N="21" REF="25">
powers and faculties of my &s;oul, to who&s;e providence I owe all the ble&s;&s;ings of my life, and by who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion it is that I exerci&s;e and enjoy them; that I am placed in this world as a creature but of a day, ha&s;tening to the place from whence I &s;hall not return. &mdash; That I am accoun|table for my conduct and behavior to this great and wi&s;e&s;t of beings, before who&s;e judgment &s;eat I mu&s;t finally ap|pear and receive the things done in my body, &mdash; whether it is good, or whether it is bad.</P>
<P>Can any one doubt but the mo&s;t in|con&s;iderate of men &s;ometimes &s;it down coolly, and make &s;ome &s;uch plain reflec|tions as the&s;e upon their &s;tate and condi|tion, &mdash; or, that after they have made
<PB N="22" REF="26">
them, can one imagine, they lo&s;e all ef|fect. &mdash; As little appearance as there is of religion in the world, there is a great deal of its influence felt, in its affairs, &mdash; nor can one &s;o root out the principles of it, but like nature they will return again and give checks and interruptions to guilty pur&s;uits. There are &s;ea&s;ons, when the thought of a ju&s;t GOD overlooking, and the terror of an after reckoning has made the mo&s;t determined tremble, and &s;top &s;hort in the execution of a wicked purpo&s;e; and if we conceive that the wor&s;t of men lay &s;ome re&s;traints upon them&s;elves from the weight of this prin|ciple, what &s;hall we think of the good and virtuous part of the world, who live under the perpetual influence of it, &mdash; who &s;acrifice their appetites and pa&s;&s;i|ons
<PB N="23" REF="27">
from confidence of their duty to GOD; and con&s;ider him as the object to whom they have dedicated their &s;ervice, and make that the fir&s;t principle, and ultimate end of all their actions. &mdash; How many real and unaffected in&s;tances there are in this world, of men, thus govern'd, will not &s;o much concern us to enquire, as to take care that we are of the num|ber, which may GOD grant for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>WHEN a man ca&s;ts a look upon this melancholy de&s;cription of the world, and &s;ees contrary to all his gue&s;&s;es and expectations, what different fates attend the lives of men, &mdash; how oft it happens in the world, that there is not even bread to the wi&s;e, nor riches to men of under&s;tanding, &amp;c. &mdash; he is apt to

<HEAD>SERMON IX. The Character of HEROD. Preached on Innocents Day.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="47">SERMON IX.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>MATTHEW II. 17.18.</BIBL>
<P>Then was fulfilled that which was &s;poken by Jeremy the prophet, &s;aying, &mdash; In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachael weeping for her children, and would not be comforted becau&s;e they are not.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE words which St. Matthew cites here as fulfilled by the cruel|ty and ambition of Herod, &mdash; are in the 31&s;t chapter of Jeremiah 15th ver&s;e. In the foregoing chapter, the prophet having declared God's intention of turn|ing the mourning of his people into joy, by the re&s;toration of the tribes which had been led away captive into Babylon;
<PB N="48" REF="48">
he proceeds in the beginning of this chapter, which contains this prophecy, to give a more particular de&s;cription of the great joy and fe&s;tivity of that promi&s;ed day, when they were to return once more to their own land, to enter upon their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and enjoy again all the privileges they had lo&s;t, and among&s;t others, and what was above them all, &mdash; the favour and protection of God, and the continuation of his mercies to them and their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>To make therefore the impre&s;&s;ion of this change the &s;tronger upon their minds &mdash; he gives a very pathetic repre|&s;entation of the preceeding &s;orrow on that day when they were fir&s;t led away captive.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aith the Lord, A voice was heard
<PB N="49" REF="49">
in Rama; lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachael weeping for her children, refu&s;ed to be comforted, becau&s;e they were not.</P>
<P>To enter into the full &s;en&s;e and beauty of this de&s;cription, it is to be remembered that the tomb of Rachael, Jacob's be|loved wife, as we read in the 35th of Gene&s;is, was &s;ituated near Rama, and betwixt that place and Bethlehem. Upon which circum&s;tance, the prophet rai&s;es one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;cenes, that could be conceived; for as the tribes in their &s;orrowful journey betwixt Rama and Bethlehem in their way to Babylon, were &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s by this monumental pil|lar of their ance&s;tor Rachael Jacob's wife, the prophet by a common liberty in rhe|toric, introduces her as ri&s;ing up out of her &s;epulchre, and as the common mother of two of their tribes, weep|ing
<PB N="50" REF="50">
for her children, bewailing the &s;ad cata&s;trophe of her po&s;terity led away into a &s;trange land &mdash; refu&s;ing to be com|forted, becau&s;e they were not, &mdash; lo&s;t and cut off from their country, and in all likelyhood, never to be re&s;tored back to her again.</P>
<P>The Jewi&s;h interpreters &s;ay upon this, that the patriarch Jacob buried Rachael in this very place, fore&s;eeing by the &s;pi|rit of prophecy, that his po&s;terity &s;hould that way be led captive, that &s;he might as they pa&s;&s;ed her, intercede for them. &mdash; </P>
<P>But this fanciful &s;uper&s;tructure upon the pa&s;&s;age, &s;eems to be little el&s;e than a mere dream of &s;ome of the Jewi&s;h doc|tors; and indeed, had they not dream't it when they did, 'tis great odds, but &s;ome
<PB N="51" REF="51">
of the Romi&s;h dreamers would have hit upon it before now. For as it favors the doctrine of interce&s;&s;ions &mdash; if there had not been undeniable vouchers for the real inventors of the conceit, one &s;hould much &s;ooner have &s;ought for it among&s;t the oral traditions of this church, than in the Talmud, where it is. &mdash; </P>
<P>But this by the bye. There is &s;till another interpretation of the words here cited by St. Matthew, which altogether excludes this &s;cenecal repre&s;entation I have given of them. &mdash; By which 'tis thought, that the lamentation of Ra|chael, here de&s;cribed, has no immediate reference to Rachael, Jacob's wife, but that it &s;imply alludes to the &s;orrows of her de&s;cendents, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mothers of the tribes of Benjamin and Ephraim who might accompany their children,
<PB N="52" REF="52">
led into captivity as far as Rama, in their way to Babylon, who wept and wailed upon this &s;ad occa&s;ion, and as the prophet de&s;cribes them in the per|&s;on of Rachael, refu&s;ing to be comforted for the lo&s;s of her children, looking upon their departure without hope or pro&s;pect of ever beholding a return.</P>
<P>Which ever of the two &s;en&s;es you give the words of the prophet, the appli|cation of them by the evangeli&s;t is equal|ly ju&s;t and faithful. For as the former &s;cene he relates, was tran&s;acted upon the very &s;ame &s;tage &mdash; in the &s;ame di&s;trict of Bethlehem near Rama &mdash; where &s;o many mothers of the &s;ame tribe now &s;uffered this &s;econd mo&s;t affecting blow &mdash; the words of Jeremiah, as the evan|geli&s;t ob&s;erves, were literally accompli&s;h|ed, and no doubt, in that horrid day,
<PB N="53" REF="53">
a voice was heard again in Rama, la|mentation and bitter weeping &mdash; Rachael weeping for her children, and refu&s;ing to be comforted: &mdash; every Bethlemiti&s;h mother involved in this calamity, behold|ing it with hopele&s;s &s;orrow &mdash; gave vent to it &mdash; each one, bewailing her children, and lamenting the hardne&s;s of their lot, with the angui&s;h of a heart as inca|pable of con&s;olation, as they were of redre&s;s. Mon&s;ter! &mdash; could no con|&s;ideration of all this tender &s;orrow, &s;tay thy hands? &mdash; Could no reflection upon &s;o much bitter lamentation throughout the coa&s;ts of Bethlehem, interpo&s;e and plead in behalf of &s;o many wretched ob|jects, as this tragedy would make? &mdash; Was there no way open to ambition but that thou mu&s;t trample upon the affec|tions of nature? Could no pity for the
<PB N="54" REF="54">
innocence of childhood &mdash; no &s;ympathy for the yernings of parental love incline thee to &s;ome other mea&s;ures for thy &s;ecurity &mdash; but thou mu&s;t thus piti|le&s;sly ru&s;h in &mdash; take the victim by violence &mdash; tear it from the embraces of the mother &mdash; offer it up, before her eyes &mdash; leave her di&s;con&s;olate for ever &mdash; broken-hearted with a lo&s;s &mdash; &s;o affecting in it&s;elf &mdash; &s;o circum&s;tanced with horror, that no time, how friendly &s;oever to the mournful &mdash; &s;hould ever be able to wear out the impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is nothing in which the mind of man is more divided than in the ac|counts of this horrid nature. &mdash; For when we con&s;ider man, as fa&s;hioned by his maker &mdash; innocent and upright &mdash; full of the tendere&s;t di&s;po&s;itions &mdash; with a heart

hi&s;torian who reports &s;uch facts, &mdash; the particular character of the per&s;on who committed them is to be con&s;idered as a voucher for their truth and credibility; &mdash; and if upon enquiry, it appears, that the man acted but con&s;i&s;tent with him|&s;elf, &mdash; and ju&s;t &s;o as you would have expected from his principles, &mdash; the cre|dit of the hi&s;torian is re&s;tored, &mdash; and the fact related &s;tands inconte&s;table, from &s;o &s;trong and concurring an evidence on its &s;ide. &mdash; </P>
<P>With this view, it may not be an unac|ceptable application of the remaining part of a di&s;cour&s;e upon this day, to give you a &s;ketch of the character of Herod, not as drawn from &s;cripture, &mdash; for in general it furni&s;hes us with few materials for &s;uch de&s;criptions: &mdash; the &s;acred &s;cripture cuts
<PB N="57" REF="57">
off in few words the hi&s;tory of the un|godly, how great &s;oever they were in the eyes of the world, &mdash; and on the other hand dwells largely upon the &s;malle&s;t actions of the righteous. &mdash; We find all the circum&s;tances of the lives of Abra|ham, I&s;aac, Jacob, and Jo&s;eph, recorded in the minute&s;t manner. &mdash; The wicked &s;eem only mentioned with regret; ju&s;t brought upon the &s;tage, on purpo&s;e to be condemned. The u&s;e and advantage of which conduct &mdash; is, I &s;uppo&s;e, the rea&s;on, &mdash; as in general it enlarges on no cha|racter, but what is worthy of imitation. 'Tis however undeniable, that the lives of bad men are not without u&s;e, &mdash; and whenever &s;uch a one is drawn, not with a corrupt view to be admired, &mdash; but on purpo&s;e to be dete&s;ted, &mdash; it mu&s;t excite &s;uch an horror again&s;t vice, as will &s;trike in|directly

the &s;ame good impre&s;&s;ion.

<P>This Herod, therefore, of whom the evangeli&s;t &s;peaks, if you take a &s;uperficial view of his life, you would &s;ay was a compound of good and evil, &mdash; that though he was certainly a bad man, &mdash; yet you would think the ma&s;s was tempered at the &s;ame time with a mix|ture of good qualities.

fair, &mdash; yet I fear 'tis often a fallacious reckoning, &mdash; which though it may &s;erve in many ordinary ca&s;es of private life, yet will not hold good in the more no|torious in&s;tances of men's lives, e&s;pe|cially when &s;o complicated with good and bad, as to exceed all common bounds and proportions. Not to be deceived in &s;uch ca&s;es we mu&s;t work by a different rule, which though it may appear le&s;s candid, &mdash; yet to make amends, I am per&s;uaded will bring us in general much nearer to the thing we want, &mdash; which is truth. The way to which is &mdash; in all judgments of this kind, to di&s;tingui&s;h and carry in your eye, the principle and ruling pa&s;&s;ion which leads the character &mdash; and &s;eparate that, from the other parts of it, &mdash; and then take notice, how far his other qualities, good and bad, are
<PB N="61" REF="61">
brought to &s;erve and &s;upport that. For want of this di&s;tinction, &mdash; we often think our&s;elves incon&s;i&s;tent creatures, when we are the furthe&s;t from it, and all the va|riety of &s;hapes and contradictory appear|ances we put on, are in truth but &s;o many different attempts to gratify the &s;ame governing appetite. &mdash; </P>
<P>With this clew, let us endeavour to unravel this character of Herod as here given.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing which &s;trikes one in it is ambition, an immoderate thir&s;t, as well as jealou&s;y of power; &mdash; how incon|&s;i&s;tent &s;oever in other parts, his cha|racter appears invariable in this, and every action of his life was true to it. &mdash; From hence we may venture to conclude,
<PB N="62" REF="62">
that this was <HI>his</HI> ruling pa&s;&s;ion, &mdash; and that mo&s;t, if not all the other wheels were put in motion by this fir&s;t &s;pring. Now let us con&s;ider how far this was the ca&s;e in fact.</P>
<P>To begin with the wor&s;t part of him, &mdash; I &s;aid he was a man of no &s;en&s;e of religion, or at lea&s;t no other &s;en&s;e of it, but that which &s;erved his turn &mdash; for he is recorded to have built temples in Judea and erected images in them for idolatrous wor&s;hip, &mdash; not from a per|&s;ua&s;ion of doing right, for he was bred a Jew, and con&s;equently taught to abhor all idolatry, &mdash; but he was in truth &s;acrificing all this time, to a greater idol of his own, his ruling pa&s;&s;ion; for if we may tru&s;t Jo&s;ephus, his &s;ole view in &s;o gro&s;s a compliance was to ingratiate him&s;elf with
<PB N="63" REF="63">
Augu&s;tus and the great men of Rome from whom he held his power. &mdash; With this he was greedy and rapacious &mdash; how could he be otherwi&s;e with &s;o devouring an appetite as ambition to provide for? &mdash; He was jealous in his nature, and &s;u&s;pi|cious of all the world. &mdash; Shew me an ambitious man, that is not &s;o; for as &s;uch a man's hand, like I&s;hmael's, is again&s;t every man, he concludes, that every man's hand in cour&s;e is again&s;t his.</P>
<P>Few men were ever guilty of more a&s;toni&s;hing acts of cruelty &mdash; and yet the particular in&s;tances of them in Herod were &s;uch as he was hurried into, by the alarms this waking pa&s;&s;ion perpe|tually gave him. He put the whole Sanadrim to the &s;word &mdash; &s;paring neither age, or wi&s;dom, or merit &mdash; 
<PB N="64" REF="64">
one cannot &s;uppo&s;e, &s;imply from an in|clination to cruelty &mdash; no &mdash; they had op|po&s;ed the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his power at Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>His own &s;ons, two hopeful youths, he cut off by a public execution &mdash; The wor&s;t men have natural affection &mdash; and &s;uch a &s;troke as this would run &s;o con|trary to the natural workings of it, that you are forced to &s;uppo&s;e the impul&s;e of &s;ome more violent inclination to over|rule and conquer it. &mdash; And &s;o it was, for the Jewi&s;h hi&s;torian tells us, 'twas jealou&s;y of power, &mdash; his darling object &mdash; of which he feared they would one day or other di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him &mdash; &s;ufficient in|ducement to tran&s;port a man of &s;uch a temper into the bloodie&s;t exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="65">Thus far this one fatal and extrava|gant pa&s;&s;ion, accounts for the dark &s;ide of Herod's character. This governing principle being fir&s;t laid open &mdash; all his other bad actions follow in cour&s;e, like &s;o many &s;ymptomatic complaints from the &s;ame di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee, if this was not the ca&s;e even of his virtues too.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t &s;ight it &s;eems a my&s;tery &mdash; how a man, &s;o black as Herod has been thus far de&s;cribed &mdash; &s;hould be able to &s;up|port him&s;elf, in the favor and friend&s;hip of &s;o wi&s;e and penetrating a body of men, as the Roman &s;enate, of whom he held his power. To counter-ballance the weight of &s;o bad and dete&s;ted a character &mdash; and be able to bear it up, as Herod did,
<PB N="66" REF="66">
one would think he mu&s;t have been ma&s;ter of &s;ome great &s;ecret worth en|quiring after &mdash; he was &s;o. But that &s;ecret was no other than what appears on this rever&s;e of his character. He was a per&s;on of great addre&s;s &mdash; popu|lar in his outward behavior. &mdash; He was generous, prince-like in his entertain|ments and expences. The world was then as corrupt at lea&s;t, as now &mdash; and Herod under&s;tood it &mdash; knew at what price it was to be bought &mdash; and what qualities would bid the highe&s;t for its good word and approbation.</P>
<P>And in truth, he judged this matter &s;o well &mdash; that notwith&s;tanding the general odium and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which aro&s;e again&s;t &s;o hateful a character &mdash; in &s;pite of all the ill impre&s;&s;ions, from &s;o
<PB N="67" REF="67">
many repeated complaints of his cruel|ties and oppre&s;&s;ions &mdash; he yet &s;temmed the torrent &mdash; and by the &s;pecious di&s;|play of the&s;e popular virtues bore him|&s;elf up again&s;t it all his life. So that at length, when he was &s;ummoned to Rome to an&s;wer for his crimes &mdash; Jo&s;ephus tells us, &mdash; that by the mere magnifi|cence of his expences &mdash; and the ap|parent genero&s;ity of his behavior, he en|tirely confuted the whole charge &mdash; and &s;o ingratiated him&s;elf with the Roman &s;enate &mdash; and won the heart of Au|gu&s;tus &mdash; (as he had that of Anthony before) that he ever after had his favor and kindne&s;s; which I cannot mention without adding &mdash; that it is an eternal &s;tain upon the character and memory of Augu&s;tus, that he &s;old his coun|tenance and protection to &s;o bad a man, for &s;o mean and ba&s;e a con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68">From this point of view, if we look back upon Herod &mdash; his be&s;t qualities will &s;hrink into little room, and how glitter|ing &s;oever in appearance, when brought to this ballance, are found wanting. And in truth, if we would not willingly be deceived in the value of any virtue or &s;et of virtues in &s;o complex a character &mdash; we mu&s;t call them to this very account; examine whom they &s;erve, what pa&s;&s;ion and what principle they have for their ma&s;ter. When this is under&s;tood, the whole clew is unravelled at once, and the character of Herod, as complicated as it is given us in hi&s;tory &mdash; when thus analy&s;ed, is &s;ummed up in three words &mdash; <HI>That he was a man of unbound|ed ambition,</HI> who &s;tuck at nothing to gratify it, &mdash; &s;o that not only his vices
<PB N="69" REF="69">
were mini&s;terial to his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, but his virtues too (if they de&s;erve the name) were drawn in, and li&s;ted into the &s;ame &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Thus much for this character of He|rod &mdash; the critical review of which has many obvious u&s;es, to which I may tru&s;t you, having time but to mention that particular one which fir&s;t led me into this examination, namely, that all objections again&s;t the evangeli&s;t's ac|count of this day's &s;laughter of the Beth|lemiti&s;h infants &mdash; from the incredibility of &s;o horrid an account &mdash; are &s;ilenced by this account of the man; &s;ince in this, he acted but like him&s;elf, and ju&s;t &s;o as you would expect in the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances, from every man of &s;o am|bitious a head &mdash; and &s;o bad a heart. &mdash; 
<PB N="70" REF="70">
Con&s;ider what havock ambition has made &mdash; how often the &s;ame tragedy has been acted upon larger theatres &mdash; where not only the innocence of childhood &mdash; or the grey hairs of the aged, have found no protection &mdash; but whole coun|tries without di&s;tinction have been put to the &s;word, or what is as cruel, have been driven forth to nakedne&s;s and fa|mine to make way for new comers un|der the guidance of this pa&s;&s;ion. &mdash; For a &s;pecimen of this, reflect upon the &s;tory related by Plutarch: &mdash; when by order of the Roman &s;enate, &s;eventy populous cities were unawares &s;acked and de&s;troy|ed at one prefixed hour, by P. Aemilius &mdash; by whom one hundred and fifty thou&s;and unhappy people were driven in one day into captivity &mdash; to be &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder to end their days in cruel labor

and angui&s;h.

<P>THERE is &s;omething in this re|flection of holy Job's, upon the &s;hortne&s;s of life, and in&s;tability of human affairs, &s;o beautiful and truly &s;ublime; that one might challenge the writings of the mo&s;t celebrated orators of antiquity, to produce a &s;pecimen of eloquence, &s;o no|ble and thoroughly affecting. Whether this effect be owing in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the pathetic nature of the &s;ubject re|flected on; &mdash; or to the ea&s;tern manner
<PB N="76" REF="74">
of expre&s;&s;ion, in a &s;tile more exalted and &s;uitable to &s;o great a &s;ubject, or (which is the more likely account,) becau&s;e they are properly the words of that being, who fir&s;t in&s;pired man with language, and taught his mouth to utter, who open|ed the lips of the dumb, and made the tongue of the infant eloquent; &mdash; to which of the&s;e we are to refer the beauty and &s;ublimity of this, as well as that of num|berle&s;s other pa&s;&s;ages in holy writ, may not &s;eem how material; but &s;urely with|out the&s;e helps, never man was better qualified to make ju&s;t and noble re|flections upon the &s;hortne&s;s of life, and in&s;tability of human affairs, than Job was, who had him&s;elf waded through &s;uch a &s;ea of troubles, and in his pa&s;&s;age had encountered many vici&s;&s;itudes of &s;torms and &s;un&s;hine, and by turns had
<PB N="77" REF="75">
felt both the extremes, of all the hap|pine&s;s, and all the wretchedne&s;s that mortal man is heir to.</P>
<P>The beginning of his days was crown|ed with every thing that ambition could wi&s;h for; &mdash; he was the greate&s;t of all the men of the Ea&s;t, &mdash; had large and un|bounded po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and no doubt en|joyed all the comforts and advantages of life, which they could admini&s;ter. &mdash; Perhaps you will &s;ay, a wi&s;e man might not be inclined to give a full loo&s;e to this kind of happine&s;s, without &s;ome better &s;e|curity for the &s;upport of it, than the mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch goods of fortune, which often &s;lip from under us, and &s;ometimes unaccountably make them&s;elves wings, and fly away. &mdash; But he had that &s;ecurity too, &mdash; for the hand of providence which
<PB N="78" REF="76">
had thus far protected, was &s;till leading him forwards, and &s;eemed engaged in the pre&s;ervation and continuance of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings; &mdash; God had &s;et a hedge about him, and about all that he had on every &s;ide, he had ble&s;&s;ed all the works of his hands, and his &s;ub&s;tance increa&s;ed every day. Indeed even with this &s;e|curity, riches to him that hath <HI>neither child or brother,</HI> as the wi&s;e man ob&s;erves, in&s;tead of a comfort prove &s;ometimes a fore travel and vexation. &mdash; The mind of man is not always &s;atisfied with the rea&s;onable a&s;&s;urance of its own enjoy|ments, but will look forwards, and if it di&s;covers &s;ome imaginary void, the want of &s;ome beloved object; to fill his place after him, will often di&s;quiet it&s;elf in vain, and &s;ay &mdash; <Q REND="inline">"For whom do I labour, and bereave my&s;elf of re&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="77">This bar to his happine&s;s God had likewi&s;e taken away, in ble&s;&s;ing him with a numerous offspring of &s;ons and daugh|ters, the apparent inheriters of all his pre&s;ent happine&s;s. &mdash; Plea&s;ing reflection! to think the ble&s;&s;ings God has indulged one's &s;elf in, &s;hall be handed and continued down to a man's own &s;eed; how little does this differ from a &s;econd enjoyment of them, to an affectionate parent, who naturally looks forwards with as &s;trong an intere&s;t upon his children, as if he was to live over again in his own po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>What could be wanting to fini&s;h &s;uch a picture of a happy man? &mdash; Surely nothing, except a virtuous di&s;po&s;ition to give a reli&s;h to the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and direct him to make a proper u&s;e of

them. &mdash; He had that too, for &mdash; he was a perfect and upright man, one that fear|ed God and e&s;chewed evil.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this pro&s;perity, which was as great as could well fall to the &s;hare of one man; &mdash; whil&s;t all the world looked gay, and &s;miled upon him, and every thing round him &s;eemed to promi&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, an increa&s;e of happine&s;s, in one in&s;tant all is changed into &s;orrow and utter de&s;pair. &mdash; </P>
<P>It plea&s;es God for wi&s;e purpo&s;es to bla&s;t the fortunes of his hou&s;e, and cut off the hopes of his po&s;terity, and in one mournful day, to bring this great prince from his palace down to the dunghill. His flocks and herds, in which con&s;i&s;ted the abundance of his wealth, were part
<PB N="81" REF="79">
con&s;umed by a fire from heaven, the remainder taken away by the &s;word of the enemy: his &s;ons and daughters, whom 'tis natural to imagine &s;o good a man had &s;o brought up in a &s;en&s;e of their duty, as to give him all rea&s;onable hopes of much joy and plea&s;ure in their future lives; &mdash; natural pro&s;pect for a parent to look forwards at, to recompen&s;e him for the many cares and anxieties which their infancy had co&s;t him; the&s;e dear pledges of his future happine&s;s were all, all &s;natched from him at one blow, ju&s;t at the time that one might imagine they were beginning to be the comfort and delight of his old age, which mo&s;t wanted &s;uch &s;taves to lean on; &mdash; and as circum&s;tances add to an evil, &s;o they did to this; &mdash; for it fell out not only by a very calamitous accident, which
<PB N="82" REF="80">
was grievous enough in it&s;elf, but like|wi&s;e upon the back of his other misfor|tunes, when he was ill prepared to bear &s;uch a &s;hock; and what would &s;till add to it, it happened at an hour when he had lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect it, when he would naturally think his children &s;ecure and out of the way of danger. <Q REND="inline">"For whil&s;t they were fea&s;ting and making merry in their elde&s;t brother's hou&s;e, a great wind out of the wilderne&s;s &s;mote the four corners of the hou&s;e, and it fell upon them."</Q></P>
<P>Such a concurrence of misfortunes are not the common lot of many: and yet there are in&s;tances of &s;ome who have un|dergone as &s;evere trials, and bravely &s;trug|gled under them; perhaps by natural force of &s;pirits, the advantages of health,

and the cordial a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend. And with the&s;e helps, what may not a man &s;u&s;tain? &mdash; But this was not Job's ca&s;e; for &s;carce had the&s;e evils fallen upon him, when he was not only borne down with a grievous di&s;temper which afflicted him from the crown of his head to the &s;ole of his foot, but likewi&s;e his three friends, in who&s;e kind con&s;olations he might have found a medicine, &mdash; even the wife of his bo&s;om, who&s;e duty it was with a gentle hand to have &s;often|ed all his &s;orrows, in&s;tead of doing this, they cruelly in&s;ulted and became the reproachers of his integrity. O God! what is man when thou thus brui&s;e&s;t him, and make&s;t his burthen heavier as his &s;trength grows le&s;s? &mdash; Who, that had found him&s;elf thus an example of the many changes and chances of this

mortal life; &mdash; when he con&s;idered him|&s;elf now &s;tripped and left de&s;titute of &s;o many valuable ble&s;&s;ings which the mo|ment before thy providence had poured upon his head; &mdash; when he reflected upon this gay delight&s;ome &s;tructure, in appear|ance &s;o &s;trongly built, &s;o plea&s;ingly &s;ur|rounded with every thing that could flat|ter his hopes and wi&s;hes, and beheld it all levelled with the ground in one moment, and the whole pro&s;pect vani&s;h with it like the de&s;cription of an enchantment; &mdash; who I &s;ay that had &s;een and felt the &s;hock of &s;o &s;udden a revolution, would not have been furni&s;hed with ju&s;t and beau|tiful reflections upon the occa&s;ion, and &s;aid with Job in the words of the text, <Q REND="inline">"That man that is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of mi&s;ery, &mdash; that he cometh forth like a flower, and is cut

<P>The words of the text are an epitome of the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> vanity of man, and contain two di&s;tinct declarations con|cerning his &s;tate and condition in each re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that he is a creature of few days; and &s;econdly, that tho&s;e days are full of trouble.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make &s;ome reflections upon each of the&s;e in their order, and conclude with a practical le&s;&s;on from the whole.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, That he is of few days. The compari&s;on which Job makes u&s;e of, That man cometh forth like a flower, is
<PB N="86" REF="84">
extremely beautiful, and more to the pur|po&s;e than the mo&s;t elaborate proof, which in truth the &s;ubject will not ea&s;ily admit of; &mdash; the &s;hortne&s;s of life being a point &s;o generally complained of in all ages &s;ince the flood, and &s;o univer&s;ally felt and acknowledged by the whole &s;pecies, as to require no evidence beyond a &s;imi|litude; the intent of which is not &s;o much to prove the fact, as to illu&s;trate and place it in &s;uch a light as to &s;trike us, and bring the impre&s;&s;ion home to our&s;elves in a more affecting manner.</P>
<P>Man comes forth, &s;ays Job, like a flower, and is cut down; &mdash; he is &s;ent into the world the faire&s;t and noble&s;t part of God's works &mdash; fa&s;hioned after the image of his creator with re&s;pect to rea&s;on and the great faculties of the

mind; he comes forth glorious as the flower of the field; as it &s;urpa&s;&s;es the vegetable world in beauty, &s;o does he the animal world in the glory and ex|cellencies of his nature.</P>
<P>The one &mdash; if no untimely accident oppre&s;s it, &s;oon arrives at the full period of its perfection, &mdash; is &s;uffered to triumph for a few moments, and is plucked up by the roots in the very pride and gaye&s;t &s;tage of its being: &mdash; or if it happens to e&s;cape the hands of violence, in a few days it nece&s;&s;arily &s;ickens of it&s;elf and dies away.</P>
<P>Man likewi&s;e, though his progre&s;s is &s;lower, and his duration &s;omething longer, yet the periods of his growth and declen&s;ion are nearly the &s;ame both in the nature and manner of them.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="86">If he e&s;capes the dangers which threaten his tenderer years, he is &s;oon got into the full maturity and &s;trength of life; and if he is &s;o fortunate as not to be hurried out of it then by accidents, by his own folly or intemperance &mdash; if he e&s;capes the&s;e, he naturally de|cays of him&s;elf; &mdash; a period comes fa&s;t upon him, beyond which he was not made to la&s;t. &mdash; Like a flower or fruit which may be plucked up by force before the time of their maturity, yet cannot be made to outgrow the pe|riod when they are to fade and drop of them&s;elves; when that comes, the hand of nature then plucks them both off, and no art of the botani&s;t can uphold the one, or &s;kill of the phy&s;ician pre&s;erve the other, beyond the periods to which their original frames and con&s;titutions were made to extend. As God has ap|pointed
<PB N="89" REF="87">
and determined the &s;everal growths and decays of the vegetable race, &s;o he &s;eems as evidently to have pre&s;cribed the &s;ame laws to man, as well as all living creatures, in the fir&s;t rudiments of which, there are contained the &s;pecifick powers of their growth, duration and extinction; and when the evolutions of tho&s;e animal powers are exhau&s;ted and run down, the creature expires and dies of it&s;elf, as ripe fruit falls from the tree, or a flower pre&s;erved beyond its bloom droops and peri&s;hes upon the &s;talk.</P>

<P>THERE are few in&s;tances of the exerci&s;e of particular virtues which &s;eem harder to attain to, or which ap|pear more amiable and engaging in them|&s;elves, than tho&s;e of moderation and the forgivene&s;s of injuries; and when the temptations again&s;t them, happen to be heightened by the bitterne&s;s of a pro|vocation on one hand, and the fairne&s;s of an opportunity to retaliate on the
<PB N="138" REF="133">
other, the in&s;tances <HI>then</HI> are truly great and heroic. The words of the text, which are the con&s;ultation of the &s;ons of Jacob among&s;t them&s;elves upon their father I&s;rael's death, when becau&s;e it was in Jo&s;eph's power to revenge the deadly injury they had formerly done him, they concluded in cour&s;e, that it was in his intention, will lead us to a beautiful example of this kind in the character and behavior of Jo&s;eph con|&s;equent thereupon; and as it &s;eems a perfect and very engaging pattern of forbearance, it may not be improper to make it &s;erve for the ground-work of a di&s;cour&s;e upon that &s;ubject. &mdash; The whole tran&s;action from the fir&s;t occa&s;ion given by Jo&s;eph in his youth, to this la&s;t act of remi&s;&s;ion, at the conclu&s;ion of his life, may be &s;aid to be a ma&s;ter|piece
<PB N="139" REF="134">
of hi&s;tory. There is not only in the manner throughout &s;uch a happy though uncommon mixture of &s;implicity and grandeur, which is a double cha|racter &s;o hard to be united, that it is &s;eldom to be met with in compo&s;itions merely human; &mdash; but it is likewi&s;e related with the greate&s;t variety of ten|der and affecting circum&s;tances, which would afford matter for reflections u&s;e|ful for the conduct of almo&s;t every part and &s;tage of a man's life. &mdash; But as the words of the text, as well as the inten|tion and compa&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e, par|ticularly confine me to &s;peak only to one point, namely, the forgivene&s;s of injuries, it will be proper only to con|&s;ider &s;uch circum&s;tances of the &s;tory, as will place this in&s;tance of it in its ju&s;t light; and then proceed to make a
<PB N="140" REF="135">
more general u&s;e of the great example of moderation and forbearance, which it &s;ets before us.</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;trange at fir&s;t &s;ight, that after the &s;ons of Jacob had fallen into Jo&s;eph's power, when they were forced by the &s;orene&s;s of the famine to go down into Egypt to buy corn, and had found him too good a man even to expo&s;tulate with them for an injury, which he &s;eemed then to have dige&s;ted, and piou&s;ly to have re&s;olved into the over-ruling providence of God, for the pre&s;ervation of much people, how they could ever after que&s;tion the uprightne&s;s of his intentions, or entertain the lea&s;t &s;u&s;|picion that his reconciliation was di&s;|&s;embled. Would not one have ima|gined, that the man who had di&s;covered
<PB N="141" REF="136">
&s;uch a goodne&s;s of &s;oul, that he &s;ought where to weep, becau&s;e he could not bear the &s;truggle of a counterfeit|ed har&s;hne&s;s, could never be &s;u&s;pected afterwards of intending a real one; &mdash; and that he only waited till their father I&s;rael's death, to requite them all the evil which they had done unto him. What &s;till adds to this difficulty is, that his affectionate manner of making him&s;elf known to them; &mdash; his goodne&s;s in forbearing, not only to reproach them for the in|jury they had formerly done him, but ex|tenuating and excu&s;ing the fault to them|&s;elves, his comforting, and &s;peaking kindly to them, and &s;econding all with the tendere&s;t marks of an undi&s;gui&s;ed forgivene&s;s, in falling upon their necks, and weeping aloud, that all the hou&s;e of Pharaoh heard him; &mdash; that more|over
<PB N="142" REF="137">
this behavior of Jo&s;eph could not appear to them, to be the effect of any warm and &s;udden tran&s;port, which might as &s;uddenly give way to other reflecti|ons, but that it evidently &s;prung from a &s;ettled principle of uncommon gene|ro&s;ity in his nature, which was above the temptation of making u&s;e of an op|portunity for revenge, which the cour&s;e of God's providence had put into his hands for better purpo&s;es; and what might &s;till &s;eemed to confirm this, was the evidence of his actions to them af|terwards, in bringing them and all their hou&s;hold up out of Canaan, and placing them near him in the land of Go&s;hen, the riche&s;t part of Egypt, where they had had &s;o many years experience of his love and kindne&s;s. And yet it is plain all this did not clear his motive from
<PB N="143" REF="138">
&s;u&s;picion, or at lea&s;t them&s;elves of &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of a change in his con|duct towards them. And was it not that the whole tran&s;action was wrote under the direction of the Spirit of truth, and that other hi&s;torians concur in doing ju&s;tice to Jo&s;eph's character, and &s;peak of him as a compa&s;&s;ionate, and merciful man, one would be apt, you will &s;ay, to imagine here, that Mo&s;es might po&s;|&s;ibly have omitted &s;ome circum&s;tances of Jo&s;eph's behavior, which had alarm|ed his brethren, betwixt the time of his fir&s;t reconciliation and that of their father's death. &mdash; For they could not be &s;u&s;picious of his intentions without &s;ome cau&s;e, and fear where no fear was. &mdash; But does not a guilty con&s;cience often do &s;o? &mdash; and though it has the grounds, yet wants the power to think it&s;elf &s;afe.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="139">And could we look into the hearts of tho&s;e who know they de&s;erve ill, we &s;hould find many an in&s;tance, where a kindne&s;s from an injured hand, where there was lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect one, has &s;truck deeper and touched the heart with a degree of remor&s;e and concern, which perhaps no &s;everity or re&s;entment could have reached. This reflection will in &s;ome mea&s;ure help to explain this diffi|culty, which occurs in the &s;tory. For it is ob&s;ervable, that when the injury they had done their brother was fir&s;t committed, and the fact was fre&s;h upon their minds, and mo&s;t likely to have filled them with a &s;en&s;e of guilt, we find no acknowledgment or complaint to one another of &s;uch a load, as one might imagine it had laid upon them; and from that event, through a long
<PB N="145" REF="140">
cour&s;e of years to the time they had gone down to Egypt, we read not once of any &s;orrow or compunction of heart, which they had felt during all that time, for what they had done. They had artfully impo&s;ed upon their parent &mdash; (and as men are ingenious ca&s;uits in their own affairs,) they had, probably, as art|fully impo&s;ed upon their own con&s;cien|ces; &mdash; and po&s;&s;ibly had never impar|tially reflected upon the action, or con|&s;idered it in its ju&s;t light, till the many acts of their brother's love and kindne&s;s had brought it before them, with all the circum&s;tances of aggravation which his behaviour would naturally give it. &mdash; They then began maturely to con&s;ider what they had done, &mdash; that they had fir&s;t unde&s;ervedly hated him in his child|hood for that, which if it was a ground
<PB N="146" REF="141">
of complaint, ought rather to have been charged upon the indi&s;cretion of the parent than con&s;idered as a fault in him. That upon a more ju&s;t examination and a better knowledge of their brother, they had wanted even that pretence. &mdash; It was not a blind partiality which &s;eemed fir&s;t to have directed their father's affec|tion to him, &mdash; though then they thought &s;o, &mdash; for doubtle&s;s &s;o much goodne&s;s and benevolence as &s;hone forth in his nature, now that he was a man, could not lay all of it &s;o deep concealed in his youth, but the &s;agacity of a parent's eye would di&s;cover it, and that in cour&s;e their en|mity towards him was founded upon that which ought to have won their e&s;teem. &mdash; That if he had incautiou&s;ly added envy to their ill will in reporting his dreams, which pre&s;aged his future great|ne&s;s,
<PB N="147" REF="142">
it was but the indi&s;cretion of a youth unpracti&s;ed in the world, who had not yet found out the art of di&s;&s;embling his hopes and expectations, and was &s;carce arrived at an age to comprehend there was &s;uch a thing in the world as envy and ambition: &mdash; that if &s;uch of|fences in a brother, &s;o fairly carried their own excu&s;es with them, what could they &s;ay for them&s;elves, when they con&s;idered it was for this they had almo&s;t unani|mou&s;ly con&s;pired to rob him of his life; &mdash; and though they were happily re&s;trained from &s;hedding his blood upon Reuben's remon&s;trance, that they had neverthele&s;s all the guilt of the intention to an&s;wer for. &mdash; That whatever motive it was, which then &s;tayed their hands, their con&s;ciences told them, it could not be a good one, &s;ince they had changed the

&s;entence for one no le&s;s cruel in it&s;elf, and what to an ingenuous nature was wor&s;e than death, to be &s;old for a &s;lave. &mdash; The one was common to all, &mdash; the other only to the unfortunate.

<P>That be&s;ides the angui&s;h of &s;u&s;pected virtue, he had felt that of a pri&s;on, where he had long lain neglected in a friend|le&s;s condition; and where the affliction of it was rendered &s;till &s;harper by the daily expectations of being remembered by Pharoah's chief butler, and the di&s;|appointment of finding him&s;elf ungrate|fully forgotten. &mdash; And though Mo&s;es tells us, that he found favour in the &s;ight of the keeper of the pri&s;on, yet the P&s;almi&s;t acquaints that his &s;ufferings were &s;till grievous; &mdash; <HI>That his feet were hurt with fetters,</HI> and the iron entered <HI>even into his &s;oul.</HI> And no doubt, his brethren thought the &s;en&s;e of their in|jury

<P>It is natural to imagine they argued and reflected in this manner, and there &s;eems no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking for the rea|&s;on of their unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;tru&s;t in Jo&s;eph's conduct, or any other external cau&s;e, &s;ince the inward workings of their own minds will ea&s;ily account for the evil they apprehended. &mdash; A &s;eries of benefits and kindne&s;&s;es from the man they had injured, gradually heightened the idea of their own guilt, till at length they could not conceive, how the tre&s;pa&s;s could be forgiven them; &mdash; it appeared with &s;uch fre&s;h circum&s;tances of aggra|vation, that though they were convinced his re&s;entment &s;lept, yet they thought

it only &s;lept, and was likely &s;ome time or other to awake, and mo&s;t probably then, that their father was dead, when the con&s;ideration of involving him in his revenge had cea&s;ed, and all the duty and compa&s;&s;ion he owed to the grey hairs and happine&s;s of a parent was di&s;|charged, and buried with him.</P>
<P>This they expre&s;s in the con&s;ultation held among&s;t them&s;elves in the words of the text; and in the following ver&s;e, we find them accordingly &s;ending to him to de|precate the evil they dreaded; and either, becau&s;e they thought their father's name more powerful than their own, in this application &mdash; or rather, that they might not commit a fre&s;h injury in &s;eeming to &s;u&s;pect his &s;incerity, they pretend their father's direction; for we read they &s;ent

Nor was there a rea&s;on in any thing, but the fear of a guilty con&s;cience to appre|hend it, as appears from the reception which the addre&s;s met, which was &s;uch as be&s;poke an uncommon goodne&s;s of

<P>We find that after Eli&s;ha had re&s;cued the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widow and her two &s;ons from the hands of the creditor, by the

 &mdash; &s;o that &s;he had not only lo&s;t her hu&s;band, which had made her mi&s;erable enough already, but was going to be bereaved of her children, which were the only comfort and &s;upport of her life; that upon her coming to Eli&s;ha with this &s;ad &s;tory, he was touched with, compa&s;|&s;ion for her misfortunes, and had u&s;ed all the power and intere&s;t which he had with his God to relieve and befriend her, which in an unheard of manner, by the miraculous increa&s;e of her oil, which was the only &s;ub&s;tance &s;he had left, he had &s;o bountifully effected, as not only to di&s;intangle her from her difficulties in paying the debt, but withal, what was &s;till more generous, to enable her to live comfortably the remainder of her days. She con&s;idered that charity and compa&s;&s;ion was &s;o leading a virtue, and

had &s;uch an influence upon every other part of a man's character, as to be a &s;uf|ficient proof by it&s;elf of the inward di&s;|po&s;ition and goodne&s;s of the heart, but that &s;o engaging an in&s;tance of it as this, exerci&s;ed in &s;o kind and &s;ea&s;onable a manner, was a demon&s;tration of his, &mdash; and that he was in truth what out|ward circum&s;tances be&s;poke, a holy man of God. &mdash; As the Shunamite's prin|ciple and motive for her ho&s;pitality to Eli&s;ha was ju&s;t, as it &s;prung from an idea of the worth and merit of her gue&s;t, &s;o likewi&s;e was the manner of doing it kind and con&s;iderate.

<PB N="176" REF="169">
mo&s;t at ea&s;e when mo&s;t private; &mdash; that the tumult and di&s;traction of a large family were not fit for the &s;ilent medi|tations of &s;o holy a man, who would per|petually there meet with &s;omething either to interrupt his devotion, or offend the purity of his manners; &mdash; that more|over, under &s;uch an independent roof, where he could take &s;helter as often as his occa&s;ions required, &s;he thought he might ta&s;te the plea&s;ure which was na|tural to man, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;omething like what he could call his own, &mdash; and what is no &s;mall part of conferring a favor, he would &s;carce feel the weight of it, or at lea&s;t much &s;eldomer in this manner, than where a daily invitation and repe|tition of the kindne&s;s perpetually put him in mind of his obligation. If any thing could &s;till add to this &mdash; it was &mdash; 
<PB N="177" REF="170">
that it did not appear to be the dry offer of a faint civility, but that it came directly from the heart.

<P>It is with benefits as with injuries in this re&s;pect, that we do not &s;o much weigh the accidental good or evil they do us, as that which they were de&s;igned to

<P>There is no burthen &s;o heavy to a grateful mind, as a debt of kindne&s;s un|paid; &mdash; and we may believe Eli&s;ha felt it &s;o, from the earne&s;t de&s;ire which he had upon the immediate receipt of this, to di&s;charge him&s;elf of it, which he expre&s;|&s;es in the text in the warme&s;t manner; &mdash; <Q REND="inline">"Behold, thou ha&s;t been careful for us with all this care? &mdash; What &s;hall be done for thee? Woulde&s;t thou be &s;poken for to the king, or the captain of his ho&s;t?"</Q> &mdash; There is a degree of hone&s;t impatience in the words, &s;uch as was natural to a

good man, who would not be behind-hand with his benefactor. &mdash; But there is one thing which may &s;eem &s;trange at fir&s;t &s;ight, that as her &s;tation and con|dition in life was &s;uch, that &s;he appeared rather to have abounded already than &s;tood in want of any thing in this world which &s;uch an application could &s;upply, &mdash; why the prophet &s;hould not rather have propo&s;ed &s;ome &s;piritual advantage, which, as it would better have become the &s;anctity of his character on the one hand, &s;o, on the other, it would have done a more real and la&s;ting &s;ervice to his friend.</P>
<P>But we are to reflect, that in returning favors, we act differently from what we do in conferring them: &mdash; in the one ca&s;e we &s;imply con&s;ider what is be&s;t, &mdash; 
<PB N="180" REF="173">
in the other, what is mo&s;t acceptable.

<P>In ju&s;tice to Eli&s;ha's motive, which mu&s;t have been good, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, he con&s;idered his offer in this light; and
<PB N="182" REF="175">
what principally led him to propo&s;e it, was the great intere&s;t which he had with the king of I&s;rael at that time, which he had merited by a &s;ignal &s;ervice; and as he had no views for him&s;elf, he thought it could not be employed &s;o well as in e&s;tabli&s;hing the fortune of one, who&s;e virtue might be &s;o &s;afely tru&s;ted with it.

<P>Whether the Shunamite dreaded to make this dangerous experiment of her|&s;elf, &mdash; or, which is more likely, that &s;he had learned to &s;et bounds to her de&s;ires, and was too well &s;atisfied with her pre|&s;ent condition to be tempted out of it, &s;he declines the offer in the clo&s;e of the text: &mdash; <Q REND="inline">"I <HI>dwell</HI> among&s;t my own <HI>peo|ple</HI>;"</Q> as if &s;he had &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"The intended kindne&s;s is far from being &s;mall, but it is not u&s;eful to me; I live here, as thou art a witne&s;s, in peace, in a contented ob|&s;curity; &mdash; not &s;o high as to provoke en|vy, nor &s;o low as to be trodden down and de&s;pi&s;ed.

our works, without being either the better, or the wi&s;er for the employ|ment.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t then let us begin with that, which is the foundation of almo&s;t all the other fal&s;e mea&s;ures we take in this mat|ter, &mdash; that is, the &s;etting about the ex|amination of our works, before we are prepared with hone&s;t di&s;po&s;itions to a|mend them. &mdash; This is beginning the work at the wrong end. The&s;e pre|vious di&s;po&s;itions in the heart, are the wheels that &s;hould make this work go ea&s;ily and &s;ucce&s;sfully forwards, &mdash; and to take them off, and proceed without them, 'tis no miracle, if like Pharaoh's cha|riots, they that drive them, &mdash; drive them heavily along.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="187">Be&s;ides, if a man is not &s;incerely in|clined to reform his faults, &mdash; 'tis not like|ly he &s;hould be inclined to &s;ee them, &mdash; nor will all the weekly preparations that ever were wrote, bring him nearer the point; &mdash; &s;o that with how &s;erious a face &s;oever he begins to examine, &mdash; he no longer does the office of an enquirer, &mdash; but an apologi&s;t, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is not to &s;earch for truth, &mdash; but &s;kilfully to hide it. &mdash; So long &mdash; therefore, as this preengagement la&s;ts betwixt the man and his old habits, &mdash; there is little pro|&s;pect of proving his works to any good purpo&s;e, &mdash; of whatever kind they are, with &s;o &s;trong an intere&s;t and power on their &s;ide. &mdash; As in other trials, &s;o in this, 'tis no wonder, if the evidence is puzzled and confounded, and the &s;everal facts and circum&s;tances &s;o twi&s;ted from
<PB N="196" REF="188">
their natural &s;hapes, and the whole proof &s;o altered and confirmed on the other &s;ide, &mdash; as to leave the la&s;t &s;tate of that man even wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>A &s;econd unhappy, though general mi&s;take in this great duty of proving our works, &mdash; is that which the apo&s;tle hints at; in the doing it, not by a direct examination of our own actions, but from a comparative view of them, with the lives and actions of other men.</P>
<P>When a man is going to enter upon this work of &s;elf-examination, &mdash; there is nothing &s;o common, as to &s;ee him &mdash; look <HI>round</HI> him &mdash; in&s;tead of looking <HI>within</HI> him. &mdash; He looks round, &mdash; finds out &s;ome one, who is more malicious, &mdash; &s;ees another that is more covetous, a
<PB N="197" REF="189">
third that is more proud and impe|rious than him&s;elf, &mdash; and &s;o indirectly forms a judgment of him&s;elf, not from a review of his life, and a proving of his own works as the apo&s;tle directs him, but rather from proving the works of others, and from their infirmities and defects drawing a deceitful conclu&s;ion in favor of him&s;elf. &mdash; In all competi|tions of this kind &mdash; one may venture to &s;ay, there will be ever &s;o much of &s;elf-love in a man, as to draw a flattering likene&s;s of one of the parties &mdash; and 'tis well &mdash; if he has not &s;o much malignity too, as to give but a coar&s;e picture of the other, &mdash; fini&s;hed with &s;o many hard &s;trokes, as to make the one as unlike its original as the other.</P>
<P>Thus the phari&s;ee when he entered
<PB N="198" REF="190">
the temple, &mdash; no &s;ooner &s;aw the pub|lican, but that moment, he formed the idea to him&s;elf of all the vices and cor|ruptions that could po&s;&s;ibly enter into the man's character, &mdash; and with great dexterity &s;tated all his own virtues and good qualities over again&s;t them. His ab&s;tinence and frequent fa&s;ting, &mdash; exact|ne&s;s in the debts and ceremonies of the law; not ballancing the account as he ought to have done, in this manner: &mdash; What! though this man is a publican and a &s;inner, have not I my vices as well as he? 'Tis true, his particular office expo&s;es him to many tempta|tions of committing extortion and inju&s;|tice; &mdash; but then &mdash; am not I a devourer of widows hou&s;es, and guilty of one of the mo&s;t cruel in&s;tances of the &s;ame crime? He po&s;&s;ibly is a prophane per&s;on, and
<PB N="199" REF="191">
may &s;et religion at nought; &mdash; but do not I my&s;elf for a pretence make long pray|ers, and bring the greate&s;t of all &s;candals upon religion, by making it the cloak to my ambition and worldly views? &mdash; If he, la&s;tly, is debauched or intempe|rate &mdash; am not I con&s;cious of as corrupt and wanton di&s;po&s;itions; and that a fair and guarded out&s;ide is my be&s;t pretence to the oppo&s;ite character?</P>
<P>If a man will examine his works by a comparative view of them with others; &mdash; this, no doubt, would be the fairer way, and lea&s;t likely to mi&s;lead him. &mdash; But as this is &s;eldom the method this trial is gone through, &mdash; in fact it generally turns out to be as treacherous and delu&s;ive to the man him&s;elf, &mdash; as it is uncandid to the man, who is dragged into the
<PB N="200" REF="192">
compari&s;on; and whoever judges of him|&s;elf by this rule, &mdash; &s;o long as there is no &s;carcity of vicious characters in the world, &mdash; 'tis to be feared, he will often take the occa&s;ions of triumph and rejoicing, &mdash; where in truth, he ought rather to be &s;orry and a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>A third error in the manner of proving our works, is what we are guilty of, when we leave out of the calculation the only material parts of them; &mdash; I mean, the motives and fir&s;t principles from whence they proceeded. There is many a fair in&s;tance of genero&s;ity, cha&s;tity, and &s;elf-denial, which the world may give a man the credit of, &mdash; which if he would give him&s;elf the lei&s;ure to reflect upon and trace back to their fir&s;t &s;prings, &mdash; he would be con&s;cious, proceeded from &s;uch
<PB N="201" REF="193">
views and intentions, as if known, would not be to his honor. &mdash; The truth of this may be made evident by a thou&s;and in&s;tances in life; &mdash; and yet there is nothing more u&s;ual than for a man when he is going upon this duty of &s;elf-exami|nation, &mdash; in&s;tead of calling his own ways to remembrance, &mdash; to clo&s;e the whole en|quiry at once, with this &s;hort challenge; &mdash; <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That he defies the world to &s;ay ill of him.</HI>"</Q> If the world has no expre&s;s evidence, this indeed may be an argument of his good luck; &mdash; but no &s;atisfactory one, of the real goodne&s;s and innocence of his life. &mdash; A man may be a very bad man, &mdash; and yet through caution, &mdash; through deep-laid policy and de&s;ign may &s;o guard all out|ward appearances, as never to want this negative te&s;timony on his &s;ide; &mdash; <HI>that the world knows no evil of him,</HI> &mdash; how
<PB N="202" REF="194">
little &s;oever he de&s;erves it. &mdash; Of all a&s;&s;ays upon a man's &s;elf, this may be &s;aid to be the &s;lighte&s;t; this method of proving the goodne&s;s of our works &mdash; differ|ing but little in kind from that un|happy one, which many unwary people take in proving the goodne&s;s of their coin, &mdash; who, if it happens to be &s;u&s;pi|cious, &mdash; in&s;tead of bringing it either to the ballance or the touch-&s;tone to try its worth, &mdash; they ignorantly go forth; try, if they can pa&s;s it upon the world: &mdash; if &s;o, all is well, and they are &s;aved all the expence and pains of enquiring after and detecting the cheat.</P>
<P>A fourth error in this duty of exami|nation of men's works, &mdash; is that of com|mitting the ta&s;k to others; &mdash; an error into which thou&s;ands of well-meaning
<PB N="203" REF="195">
creatures are en&s;nared in the Romi&s;h church by her doctrines of auricular con|fe&s;&s;ion, of works of &s;upererogation, and the many lucrative practices rai&s;ed upon that capital &s;tock. &mdash; The trade of which is carried to &s;uch a height in Popi&s;h coun|tries, that if you was at Rome or Na|ples now, and was di&s;po&s;ed in compli|ance with the apo&s;tle's exhortation in the text, &mdash; to &s;et about this duty, to prove your <HI>own</HI> works, &mdash; 'tis great odds whe|ther you would be &s;uffered to do it your|&s;elf, without interruption; and you might be &s;aid to have e&s;caped well, if the fir&s;t per&s;on you con&s;ulted upon it did not talk you out of your re&s;olution, and po&s;|&s;ibly your &s;en&s;es too at the &s;ame time. &mdash; Prove your works? &mdash; for heaven's &s;ake, de&s;i&s;t from &s;o ra&s;h an undertaking; &mdash; what! &mdash; tru&s;t your own &s;kill and judg|ment
<PB N="204" REF="196">
in a matter of &s;o much difficulty and importance &mdash; when there are &s;o many who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, &mdash; who under|&s;tand it &s;o well, and who can do it for you with &s;o much &s;afety and advantage!</P>
<P>If your works mu&s;t be proved, you would be advi&s;ed by all means to &s;end them to undergo this operation with &s;ome one who knows what he is about, either &s;ome expert and noted confe&s;&s;or of the church, &mdash; or to &s;ome Convent or religious &s;ociety, who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large &s;tock of good works of all kinds, wrought up by &s;aints and confe&s;|&s;ors, where you may &s;uit your&s;elf &mdash; and either get the defects of your own &s;up|plied, &mdash; or be accommodated with new ones ready proved to your hands, &s;ealed, and certified to be &s;o, by the Pope's
<PB N="205" REF="197">
commi&s;&s;ary and the notaries of his eccle|&s;ia&s;tic court. There needs little more to lay open this fatal error, &mdash; than barely to repre&s;ent it. So I &s;hall only add a &s;hort remark, &mdash; that they who are per&s;uaded to be thus virtuous by proxy, and will prove the goodne&s;s of their works only by de|puties, &mdash; will have no rea&s;on to complain again&s;t God's ju&s;tice, &mdash; if he &s;uffers them to go to heaven, only in the &s;ame man|ner, &mdash; that is, &mdash; by deputies too.</P>
<P>The la&s;t mi&s;take which I &s;hall have time to mention, is that which the me|thodi&s;ts have revived, for 'tis no new error &mdash; but one which has mi&s;led thou|&s;ands before the&s;e days wherever enthu&s;i|a&s;m has got footing, &mdash; and that is, &mdash; the attempting to prove their works, by that very argument which is the greate&s;t
<PB N="206" REF="198">
proof of their weakne&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition; &mdash; I mean that extraordinary impul&s;e and intercour&s;e with the Spirit of God which they pretend to, and who&s;e operations (if you tru&s;t them) are &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt in their hearts and &s;ouls, as to render at once all other proofs of their works needle&s;s to them&s;elves. &mdash; This, I own, is one of the the mo&s;t &s;ummary ways of proceeding in this duty of &s;elf-examination, and as it proves a man's works in the gro&s;s, it &s;aves him a world of &s;ober thought and enqui|ry after many vexatious particulars.</P>
<P>Indeed, if the premi&s;es were true, &mdash; the inference is direct. For when a man dreams of the&s;e inward workings &mdash; and wakes with the impre&s;&s;ion of them &s;trong upon his brain; &mdash; 'tis not &s;trange, he &s;hould think him&s;elf a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el, &mdash; &s;ancti|fied
<PB N="207" REF="199">
within and &s;ealed up unto the per|fect day of redemption; and &s;o long as &s;uch a one is led captive to this error, &mdash; there is nothing in nature to induce him to this duty of examining his own works in the &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tle: &mdash; for how|ever bad they are, &mdash; &s;o long as his cre|dulity and enthu&s;ia&s;m equals them, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould di&s;turb his con|&s;cience or frighten him into a reforma|tion. The&s;e are &s;ome of the unhappy mi&s;takes in the many methods this work is &s;et about, &mdash; which in a great mea&s;ure rob us of the fruits we expected &mdash; and &s;ome|times &s;o entirely bla&s;t them, that we are neither the better or wi&s;er for all the pains we have taken.</P>
<P>There are many other fal&s;e &s;teps, which lead us the &s;ame way, &mdash; but the deli|neation
<PB N="208" REF="200">
of the&s;e however may &s;erve at pre|&s;ent, not only as &s;o many land-marks to guard us from this dangerous coa&s;t which I have de&s;cribed, but to direct us like|wi&s;e into that &s;afe one, where we can only expect the reward the go&s;pel pro|mi&s;es. For, if according to the fir&s;t recited cau&s;es, a man fails in examining his works from a di&s;inclination to re|form them, &mdash; from partiality of com|pari&s;ons, &mdash; from flattery to his own motives, and a vain dependence upon the opinion of the world, &mdash; the con|clu&s;ion is unavoidable, &mdash; that he mu&s;t &s;earch for the qualities the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the&s;e for his conductors. &mdash; And if he hopes to di&s;charge this work &s;o as to have advantage from it, &mdash; that he mu&s;t &s;et out upon the principles of an hone&s;t head, willing to reform it&s;elf, and
<PB N="209" REF="201">
attached principally to that object, with|out regard to the &s;piritual condition of others, or the mi&s;guided opinions which the world may have of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>That for this end &mdash; he mu&s;t call his own ways to remembrance, and &s;earch out his &s;pirit, &mdash; &s;earch his actions with the &s;ame critical exactne&s;s and &s;ame pier|cing curio&s;ity, we are wont to &s;it in judgment upon others; &mdash; varni&s;hing no|thing &mdash; and di&s;gui&s;ing nothing. If he proceeds thus, and in every relation of life takes a full view of him&s;elf with|out prejudice &mdash; traces his actions to their principles without mercy, and looks into the dark corners and rece&s;&s;es of his heart without fear &mdash; and upon &s;uch an enquiry &mdash; he acts con&s;i&s;tent with his view in it, by reforming his errors, &s;epa|rating

the dro&s;s and purifying the whole ma&s;s with repentance; &mdash; this will bid fair for examining a man's works in the apo&s;tle's &s;en&s;e: &mdash; and whoever di&s;charges the duty thus &mdash; with a view to &s;cripture, which is the rule in this ca&s;e &mdash; and to rea|&s;on, which is the applier of this rule in all ca&s;es &mdash; need not fear but he will have what the apo&s;tle calls <HI>rejoicing in him&s;elf,</HI> and that he will lay the foundation of his peace and comfort where it ought to lay &mdash; that is, within him&s;elf &mdash; in the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, and the joyful ex|pectation that having done his utmo&s;t to examine his <HI>own</HI> works here, that God will accept them hereafter through the merits of Chri&s;t, which God grant, Amen.</P>

<P>There are few in&s;tances of particular virtue more engaging than tho&s;e, of this heroic ca&s;t, and if we may take the te&s;ti|mony of a heathen philo&s;opher upon it, there is not an object in this world which God can be &s;uppo&s;ed to look down upon with greater plea&s;ure, than that of a good man involved in misfortunes, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides with difficulties, &mdash; yet chear|fully bearing up his head, and &s;truggling again&s;t them with firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy of mind. &mdash; Certainly to our conceptions &s;uch objects mu&s;t be truly engaging, &mdash; and the rea&s;on of &s;o exalted an encomium from this hand, is ea&s;y to be gue&s;&s;ed: no doubt the wi&s;e&s;t of the heathen philo|&s;ophers

And for this rea|&s;on 'tis ob&s;ervable that there is no &s;ub|ject, upon which the moral writers of

antiquity have exhau&s;ted &s;o much of their eloquence, or where they have &s;pent &s;uch time and pains, as in this of endeavour|ing to reconcile men to the&s;e evils. In|&s;omuch, that from thence in mo&s;t mo|dern languages, the patient enduring of affliction has by degrees obtained the name of philo&s;ophy, and almo&s;t mono|polized the word to it&s;elf, as if it was the chief end, or compendium of all the wi&s;dom which philo&s;ophy had to offer. And indeed con&s;idering what lights they had, &s;ome of them wrote extremely well; yet, as what they &s;aid proceeded more from the head, than the heart, 'twas generally more calculated to &s;ilence a man in his troubles, than to convince, and teach him how to bear them. And therefore however &s;ubtle and ingenious their arguments might appear in the

As they enjoyed the advantages of life with indifference, &mdash; they were able to re&s;ign them with the &s;ame temper, &mdash; and con&s;equently &mdash; were out of the reach of fortune.

The philo&s;ophic con&s;olations in &s;ickne&s;s, or in afflictions for the death of friends and kindred, were ju&s;t as efficacious, &mdash; and were rather in general to be con&s;idered as good &s;ay|ings

Upon which &s;age coun&s;el, as well as many other le&s;&s;ons of the &s;ame &s;tamp, the &s;ame reflection might be applied, which is &s;aid to have been made by one of the roman empe|rors, to one who admini&s;tered the &s;ame con&s;olation to him on a like occa&s;ion &mdash;
