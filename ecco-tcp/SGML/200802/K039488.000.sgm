<P>THE Author of this Mu&s;ical Farce, begs leave to inform the readers, if there &s;hould be any, that it was merely intended to introduce the <HI>Little Gip&s;y</HI> to the public, who&s;e youth and total inexperience of the &s;tage, made it nece&s;&s;ary to give as little dialogue to her character as po&s;&s;ible, her &s;ucce&s;s depending wholly upon her &s;inging&mdash;This rea&s;on added to another, which is, that the piece was produced at an early part of the &s;ea&s;on, when better writers are not willing to come forth, is the be&s;t apology the Author can make for its defects.</P>

<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>GO on, dear &s;i&s;ter Dolly&mdash;And &s;o my &s;weet girl was brought to the Widow Gadly's, as a relation of her's from Shrop&s;hire, and went by the name of Belton?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes&mdash;you had not been gone to London two days, before your father and &s;he met in the Wi|dow's garden; I was with him, he was very inqui&s;i|tive indeed, and was &s;truck with her lively manner; I could hardly get him home to dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this was beyond expectation; and &s;o, Dolly&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, his liking went much beyond my ex|pectation,
<PB REF="6">
or your wi&s;hes: In a week he fell in love with her, and is at this time a very dangerous rival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;ure to have &s;ome mi&s;chief happen in all my &s;chemes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her &s;inging, and twenty little agreeable fooleries &s;he puts, on have bewitch'd him: Her mi|miking the Gip&s;ies has &s;o inchanted him, that he has prevailed upon her to come to the May-pole to-day among the holiday lads and la&s;&s;es, and tell their for|tunes. She has dre&s;s'd up her&s;elf often and been among 'em, without their knowing who &s;he is&mdash;in &s;hort, &s;he has bewitch'd the whole village&mdash;I am to be there too as her mother&mdash;My father will have it &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WM.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better, while you are telling fortunes, I may talk to her without being ob&s;erv'd; &s;end but a fortune-teller, or a mountebank, among country people, and they have no eyes, and ears, for any thing el&s;e: Where is my father now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon &s;ome knotty point with Roger Dozey, the clerk&mdash;I mu&s;t go, and prepare for the frolick: don't be melancholy, Will; the wor&s;t that can hap|pen is to marry the girl without your father's con&s;ent, turn gip&s;y with your wife, and &s;end your children to &s;teal his poultry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WM.</SPEAKER>
<P>But harkee, Dolly, who is to have Mr. Goodwill's May-day legacy? A hundred pounds is a tolerable foundation to build upon&mdash;What is become of George, Dolly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not time to tell you&mdash;He is a rogue like the re&s;t of you: But as I have a heart that can make an hone&s;t man happy that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, &s;o it has a &s;pirit within it to de&s;pi&s;e a knave, or a coxcomb.</P>
