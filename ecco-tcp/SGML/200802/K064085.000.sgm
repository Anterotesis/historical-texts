<HEAD>THE LIFE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Was born of reputable parents in the city of Canterbury, where my father, living at the &s;ign of the Blue anchor, dealt in &s;lops. He had but two children, a daughter and my&s;elf, and having given me a good &s;chool education, at the age of &s;ixteen he bound me apprentice to Mr. George Roberts, an Attorney in our town, with whom I &s;tayed four years and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ee quarters to his great content and my own &s;atisfaction. So that had we been together till my time was up, I have great rea&s;on to believe he would have taken me into partner&s;hip; but, God's will be done, my unfortunate &s;tars decreed otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter being come to woman's e&s;tate, had now been married &s;omething more than a twelve-month to one Sawyer, a &s;eafaring man, who having got con&s;iderable prizes, my father al&s;o giving him 200l. with my &s;i&s;ter, quitted his profe&s;&s;ion and &s;et up a public hou&s;e within three miles of the place of his nativity, which was Deal, in the county of Kent.</P>
<P>I had frequent invitations to go and pa&s;s a &s;hort time with them; and in the autumn of the year 1709, having obtained my ma&s;ter's con&s;ent for that purpo&s;e, I left the city of Canterbury on foot, the 17th day of September.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3">Through &s;ome unavoidable delays on the road, the evening was con&s;iderable advanced before I reached Deal; and &s;o tired was I, being unus'd to that way of travelling, that, had my life depended on it, I could not get as far as my &s;i&s;ter's that night, &s;he living, as I have already &s;aid three mile beyond the place. At this time there were many of her Maje&s;ty Queen Anne's &s;hips lying in the har|bour, for the Engli&s;h were then at war with the French and Spaniards: be&s;ides which, I found this was the day for holding the yearly fair, &s;o that the town was filled to that degree, that a bed was not to be got for love or money. I went &s;eeking a lodg|ing from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, to no purpo&s;e, till, being quite &s;pent, I returned to the public hou&s;e where I had fir&s;t made enquiry, de&s;iring leave to &s;it by their kitchen fire, and re&s;t my&s;elf till morning.</P>
<P>The publican and his wife happened to be ac|quainted with my brother and &s;i&s;ter, and finding by my di&s;cour&s;e, that I was a relation of theirs and going to vi&s;it them, the Landlady pre&s;ently &s;aid &s;he would endeavour to get a bed; and going out of the kitchen &s;he quickly after called me into a par|lour, that led from it. Here I &s;aw &s;itting by the fire-&s;ide a middle aged man in a night gown and cap, who was rekoning money at a table. "Un|cle," &s;aid the woman, as &s;oon as I entered, "this is a brother of our friend Mrs Sawyer; he cannot get a bed any where, and is tired after a long journey. You are the only, one that lies in this hou&s;e alone, will you give him part of yours? To this the man, an&s;wered, that &s;he knew he had been out of order that he was blooded that day, and con&s;equently a bedfellow could not be very agreeable; "however, &s;aid he, rather then the young man &s;hall &s;et up, he
<PB N="4" REF="4">
is welcome to &s;leep with me. After this we &s;et a while together, when having put his money in a canvas bag, into the pocket of his night gown, he took the candle and I followed him up to bed.</P>
<P>How long I &s;lept, I cannot exactly determine, but I conjecture it was about three o'clock i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the morning when I awakened with a violent cholic. I found my Chum awake as well as my&s;elf; he a&s;ked me what was the matter; I informed him, and at the &s;ame time begged he would direct me to the nece&s;&s;ary. He told me, when I was down &s;tairs, I mu&s;t turn on my right hand, and go &s;trait into the garden, at the end of which it was, ju&s;t over the &s;ea, but, adds he, you may po&s;&s;ibly find &s;ome dif|ficulty in opening the door, the &s;tring being broke which pulls up the latch. I will give you a penknife which you may open it with thro' a chink in the boards. So &s;aying, he put his hand into his wai&s;t|coat pocket, which lay on him on the bed, and gave me a middling &s;ized penknife.</P>
<P>I hurried on a few of my cloaths, and went down &s;tairs; but I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that uncla&s;ping the penknife to open the door of the nece&s;&s;ary, ac|cording to his direction, a piece of money which &s;tuck between the blade and the groove in the han|dle fell into my hand: I did not examine what it was, nor Indeed could I well &s;ee, there being but a very faint moon light, &s;o I put them together care|le&s;sly in my pocket.</P>
<P>I apprehend I &s;taid in the garden pretty near a quarter of an hour. When I returned to the cham|ber, I was &s;urprized to find my bedfellow gone: I called &s;everal times but receiving no an&s;wer, I went to bed, and again fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">About &s;ix o'clock I aro&s;e, nobody yet being up in the hou&s;e. The gentleman was not yet returned to bed, or, if he was, had again left it. I dre&s;t my&s;elf with what ha&s;te I could, being impatient to &s;ee my &s;i&s;ter, and the reckoning being paid over night, I let my&s;elf out at the &s;treet door.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with a relation of the kind|ne&s;s with which my &s;i&s;ter and her hu&s;band received me. We breakfa&s;ted together, and I believe it might be about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, when &s;tanding at the door my brother in law be|ing by my &s;ide, we &s;aw three hor&s;emen galloping towards us. As &s;oon as they came up to the hou&s;e, they &s;topt and one of them lighting, &s;uddenly &s;ei|zed me by the collar, crying, You are King's pri|&s;oner. I de&s;ired to know my crime. He &s;aid I &s;hould know that as &s;oon as I came to Deal, where I mu&s;t immediately go with them. One of them then told my brother that the night before I had committed a murder and robbery.</P>
<P>Re&s;i&s;tance would have proved as vain as my tears and prote&s;tations of my innocence. In a word, a warrant was produced, and I was carried back to Deal attended by the three men; my brother with another friend accompanying us, who knew not what to &s;ay for, nor how to comfort me.</P>
<P>Being arrived in town I was immediately hurried to the hou&s;e where I had &s;lept the proceeding night the ma&s;ter of which was one of the three men that came to apprehend me, though in my fir&s;t hurry I did not recollect him. We were met at the door by a crowd of people, every one crying, Which is he? which is he? As &s;oon as I entered, I was acce&s;ted by the publican's wife in tears, O! cur&s;ed wretch, what ha&s;t thou done? thou ha&s;t murdered and rob|bed
<PB N="6" REF="6">
my poor dear uncle, and all through me who put thee to lie with him. But where ha&s;t thou hid his money and what ha&s;t thou done with his body? Thou &s;hall be hanged on a gallows as high as a may pole. My brother begged her to be pacified, and I was taken into a private room. They then began to que&s;tion me as the woman had done, about where I had put the money, and how I had di&s;po|&s;ed of the body. I a&s;ked them what money, and who&s;e body they meant. They then &s;aid I had killed the per&s;on I had lain with the proceeding night, for the &s;ake of a large &s;um I had &s;een with him. I fell down of upon my knees, calling God to witne&s;s, I knew nothing of what they accu&s;ed me, Then &s;omebody cried, Carry him up &s;tairs, and I was brought into the chamber where I had &s;lept. Here the man of the hou&s;e went to the bed, and turning down the cloaths, &s;hewed the &s;heets, pillow and bol&s;ter dyed in blood. He a&s;ked me did I know any thing of that? I declared to God I did not. Says a per&s;on in the room, Young man &s;ome|thing very odd mu&s;t have pa&s;t here la&s;t night, for lying in the next chamber, I heard groanings, and going up and down &s;tairs more than once or twice, I then told them the circum&s;tance of my illne&s;s, and that I had been up and down my&s;elf, with all that pa&s;&s;ed between my bedfellow and me. Some|body propo&s;ed to &s;earch me; &s;everal began to turn my pockets in&s;ide out, and from my wai&s;tcoat tumbled the penknife and the piece of money I have already mentioned, and I had entirely forgot. Upon &s;eeing the&s;e the woman immediately &s;cream|ed out, O God! there's my uncle's penknife! then taking up the money, and calling the people about her, Here, &s;aid &s;he, is what puts the villain's guilt
<PB N="7" REF="7">
beyond a doubt, I can &s;wear to this William and Mary's guinea, my uncle has long had it by way of pocket piece, and engraved the fir&s;t letters of his name upon it. She then began to cry afre&s;h, while I could do nothing but continue to call hea|ven to witne&s;s that I was as innocent as the child unborn. The con&s;table who had heard me mention the having gone down into the garden, told the people I mu&s;t have thrown the body down the ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and going thither, Here, &s;aid he, after having cut the throat, he has let the body down into the &s;ea. This every body immediately a&s;&s;en|ted to. Then, (&s;aid the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e) it is in vain to look for the body any further, for there was a &s;pring tide la&s;t night which has carried it off.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of the&s;e proceedings was an immediate examination before a ju&s;tice of peace; after which I &s;uffered a long and rigorous impri&s;on|ment in the county town of Maid&s;tone. For &s;ome time, my father, my ma&s;ter and my relations were inclined to think me innocent, becau&s;e I declared I was &s;o, as well I might, and in compliance with my earne&s;t reque&s;t, an adverti&s;ement was publi&s;hed in the London Gazette, repre&s;enting my deplorable circum&s;tances, and offering a reward to any per&s;on who could give tidings of Mr. Richard Collings, (the man I was &s;uppo&s;ed to have murdered) either alive or dead. No information, however, of any kind came to hand, at the a&s;&s;izes therefore, I was brought up to my trial, and circum&s;tances appearing &s;trong again&s;t me, I received &s;entence to be carried in a cart the Wedne&s;day fortnight following to the town of Deal, and there to be hanged before the Inn-keeper's door where I had committed the mur|der; after which I was to be hung in chains within a &s;tone's throw of my brother's hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">Nothing could have &s;upported me under this dreadful condemnation, but a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my not being guilty of the crime for which I was to &s;uffer. My friends now began to con&s;ider my de|clarations of my innocence, as per&s;i&s;ting in fal&s;hood to the per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ition of my &s;oul; many of them di&s;con|tinued their enquiries after me, and tho&s;e few who &s;till came to vi&s;it me, only came to urge me to con|fe&s;&s;ion, but I was re&s;olved I would never die with a lie of that kind in my mouth.</P>
<P>The Monday was now arrived before the fatal day, when an end was to be put to my mi&s;eries&punc; I was called down into the court of the pri&s;on, but I own I was not a little &s;hocked, when I found it was to be taken mea&s;ure of for my irons in which I was to be hung after execution. A fellow pri&s;oner ap|peared before me in the &s;ame woful plight, (he had robbed the mail) and the Smith was mea&s;uring him when I came down; while tha Goaler, with as much calmne&s;s as if he had been ordering a pair of &s;tays for his daughter, was giving directions in what manner the irons &s;hould be made, &s;o as to &s;upport the man who was remarkably heavy and corpulent.</P>
<P>Between this and the day of execution, I &s;pent my time alone in prayer and meditation.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">At length Wedne&s;day morning came, and about three o'clock I was put in a cart, but &s;ure &s;uch a day of wind, rain and thunder, never blew out of the heavens, and when we arrived at Deal, it became &s;o violent, that the Sheriff and his Officers, could &s;carce &s;it their hor&s;es: for my own part, I was in&s;en|&s;ible to every object about me: I therefore heard the Sheriff whi&s;per the Executioner to make what di&s;patch he could, without the lea&s;t emotion, and &s;uffered him to tuck me up like a log of wood, un|con&s;cious of what he was doing.</P>
<P>I can give no account of what I felt when hang|ing, only remember, after being turned off, &s;ome|thing appeared about me like a blaze of fire, nor do I know how long I hung, no doubt the violence of the weather favoured me greatly in that circum|&s;tance. What I am now going to tell you, I learned from my brother, which was, that having hung half an hour, the Sheriff's officers all went off, and I was cut down by the Executioner; but when he came to put the irons upon me, it was found that the irons of the other man which were too large for me, had been &s;ent in&s;tead of mine: this they reme|died by &s;tuffing rags between my body and the hoops, after which I was taken to the place appointed and hung on a gibbet which was ready prepared.</P>
<P>The cloth over my face being &s;lightly tied, was &s;oon detached by the wind, and probably its blow|ing on my face expedited my recovery, certain it is, that in this &s;ituation I came to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The gibbet was placed at one corner of a field, where my &s;i&s;ter's cows ran, and about this time a lad came to drive them home for evening milking, The creatures which were feeding almo&s;t under me, brought him near the gibbet; and in the very mo|ment
<PB N="10" REF="10">
he looked up, &s;aw me open my eyes and move my under jaw. He immediately ran home to in|form the people at his ma&s;ter's. At fir&s;t they made &s;ome difficulty to believe his &s;tory, at length, my brother come out, and by the time he got to the field, I was &s;o much alive, that my groans were very audible.</P>
<P>In their confu&s;ion, the fir&s;t thing they thought of was a ladder One of my brother's men mounted and putting his hand to my &s;tomach felt my heart beating &s;trongly. But it was found impo&s;&s;ible to de|tach me from the gibbet, without cutting it down. A &s;aw was got for that purpo&s;e, and in le&s;s than half an hour, having freed me from my irons, they got me blooded and put in a warm bed.</P>
<P>It is amazing, that tho' above eight per&s;ons was entru&s;ted with this tran&s;action, and I remained three days in the place after it happened, not one betrayed the &s;ecret. Early next morning it was known the gibbet was cut down, and it occurred to every body that it was done by my relations, to put a veil over their &s;hame, by burying the body, but when my brother was &s;ummoned to the Mayor's hou&s;e, in order to be que&s;tioned, and he denied knowing any thing of the matter, little more &s;tir was made about it, beeau&s;e he was re&s;pected by all the neighbouring gentlemen, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure, becau&s;e I per&s;i&s;ted in being innocent of the fact for which I &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Thus was I delivered from an ignominious death but how was I to di&s;po&s;e of my life now I had re|gained it. To &s;tay in England was impo&s;&s;ible, with|out expo&s;ing my&s;elf to the terrors of the law. In this dilemna a fortunate circum&s;tance occurred. There had lain at my brother's hou&s;e, &s;ome of the principal Officers of a privateer that was preparing
<PB N="11" REF="11">
for a cruize, and ju&s;t then ready to &s;ail. The cap|tain offered to take me aboard with him, and proper nece&s;&s;aries being provided for me, my &s;i&s;ter giving me ten guineas in my pocket, recommended me to the protection of God and the worthy Commander, who received me in the light of his Clerk, and a &s;ort of Under-a&s;&s;i&s;tant to his Pur&s;er.</P>
<P>We had been &s;ix months out upon our cruize, having had but indifferent &s;ucce&s;s, when being on the coa&s;t of Florida, then in the hands of the Spa|niards, we fell in with a &s;quadron of their men of war; and being con&s;equently taken without &s;triking a &s;troke, were all brought pri&s;oners into the harbour of St. Helen's. I was really tired of my life, and &s;hould have been glad to have ended it in the dun|geon, where, with forty others of my countrymen, the enemy had put me; but after three years con|finement, we were let out, in order to be put on board tran&s;ports, to be conveyed to Penn&s;ylvania, and from thence to England. This was a di&s;agree|able &s;entence to me, taking it for granted, that a return home would be a return to the gallows. Be|ing therefore, a tolerable ma&s;ter of the Spani&s;h language, I &s;olicited to be left behind; which favour I obtained, by means of the ma&s;ter of the pri&s;on and he not only took me into his hou&s;e, as &s;oon as my countrymen were gone, but, in a &s;hort time, procured me a &s;mall &s;alary from the Governor, for being his Deputy.</P>
<P>Indeed, at this particular time the office was by no means agreeable. The coa&s;t had been long in|fe&s;ted with pirates, the mo&s;t de&s;perate gang of villains that can be imagined; and &s;carce a month pa&s;&s;ed, but one or other of their ve&s;&s;els fell into the Governor's hands, and the crew as con&s;tantly was
<PB N="12" REF="12">
put under my care. Once I very narrowly e&s;caped being knocked on the head by one of the ruffians, and having the keys took from me: Another time I was &s;hot at. It is true, in both ca&s;es the per&s;ons &s;uffered for their attempt, and in the la&s;t, I thought a little too cruelly; for the per&s;on that let off the carabine, was not only put to the torture to confe&s;s his accomplices, but af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rwards broke on the wheel where he was left to expire, the mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;pec|tacle I ever beheld.</P>
<P>I had been in my office about three months, when a &s;hip arrived from Port Royal, another Spani&s;h &s;ettlement on the coa&s;t, and nine Engli&s;h pri&s;oners on board. I was &s;tanding in the &s;treet as they were coming up from the port, to the Governor's hou&s;e. I thought &s;omething &s;truck me, in the face of one of the pri&s;oners, that I had before been acquainted with. I could not then &s;top them for us to &s;peak together; but in about an hour after, they were all brought to the pri&s;on, there to be lodged till the Governor &s;ignified his further plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the poor creatures found I was an Eng|li&s;hman, they were extremely happy, even in their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, though indeed they were treated with lenity enough, and only &s;ent to the pri&s;on till a lodging could be provided for them, they having been in the cour&s;e of the War, made pri&s;oners as well as my&s;elf, and then on their return home. I now had an opportunity of taking notice of the man who&s;e face I thought I knew, and I was more and more confirmed that I was not mi&s;taken. And I verily thought, that this was the man, for who&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed murder I &s;uffered &s;o much in England, and the thought being &s;trong in my head, I could not &s;leep all night.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">The morning after their arrival, I told them, that if any of them had a mind to go about the town I would procure them permi&s;&s;ion, and go with them. This man &s;aid he would go, and it was as I wi&s;hed. Three other pri&s;oners that went along with us, walked a little in advance. I then took the opportunity, and looking in his face, Sir, &s;aid I, was you ever at Deal? I believe, he, at that in&s;tant had &s;ome recollection of me; for, putting his hand on my &s;houlder, tears bur&s;t into his eyes. Sir, &s;aid I, if you are the man I take you for, you here &s;ee before you one of the mo&s;t unfortunate of human kind; Sir, is your name Richard Collins? He re|plied, Yes. Then cried I, I was hanged and gib|beted upon your account in England.</P>
<P>After our fir&s;t &s;alutation and mutual &s;urprize in meeting being over, he made me give him a cir|cum&s;tantial detail of every thing that happened to me in England, from the moment we parted. I never &s;ee any man expre&s;s &s;uch concern as he did, while I was pur&s;uing my melancholy adventures; but, when I came to the circum&s;tance of my being hanged, and afterwards hung in chains, I could hardly prevail upon him to believe my relation, till backed by the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations, pronoun|ced in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner. When I had done, Well, &s;aid he, young man, (for I was then but in my 25th year, Mr. Collins might be about three and forty) if you have &s;u&s;tained misfortunes on my account, do not imagine (though I cannot lay them at your door) that I have been without my &s;ufferings. God knows my heart, I am mo&s;t ex|ceedingly &s;orry for the inju&s;tice that has been done you; but the ways of providence are un&s;earchable. He then informed me by what accident all my troubles had been brought about.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14">When you left me in bed, &s;aid he, having at fir&s;t waked with an oppre&s;&s;ion I could not account for, I found my&s;elf exceedingly &s;ick and weak, I groan|ed and &s;ighed, and thought my&s;elf going to die, when, accidentally putting my hand to my left arm, in which I had been blooded the morning before, I found my &s;hirt wet, and in &s;hort, that the band|age having &s;lipped, the orifice was again opened, and a great flux of blood en&s;ued. This immediately accounted for the condition I found my&s;elf in. I thought however, I would not di&s;turb the family, which had gone to bed very late, I therefore mu&s;|tered all my &s;trength and got up, with my night-gown loo&s;e about me, in order to go to a neigh|bouring barber, who had bled me, and have him to tie up my arm. He lived directly oppo&s;ite to our hou&s;e: but when I got in the &s;treet, and cro&s;&s;ed the way, in order to knock at his door, a band of men armed with cutla&s;&s;es and hangers, came and &s;iezed me, and hurried me to the beach. I begged and prayed, but they &s;oon &s;ilenced my cries, by clapping a gag in my mouth. At fir&s;t, I took them for a pre&s;s gang, though I &s;oon found they were a gang of ruffians belonging to a privateer, aboard which they immediately brought me. But before I got thither, lo&s;s of blood occa&s;ioned me to faint away. The &s;urgeon of the &s;hip, I &s;uppo&s;e, tied up my arm; for when my &s;en&s;es returned. I found my&s;elf in a hammock, and &s;omebody feeling my pul&s;e. The ve&s;&s;el being then under way, I a&s;ked where I was? They &s;aid I was &s;afe enough. I im|mediately called for my night gown, it was brought me, but of a con&s;iderable &s;um of money that was in the pocket of it, I could get no account.

done me, and of the robbery his men had commit|ted, but he laughed at me, and &s;aid I &s;hould &s;oon have prize money enough to make me amends, &s;o I was obliged to &s;ubmit; and for three months they forced me to work before the ma&s;t. At la&s;t we met the &s;ame fate that you did, and by adventures pa|rallel to your own, you &s;ee me here on my return to our native country, and if you will accompany me, I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy.</P>
<P>There was nothing to prevent my going to Eng|land, and the &s;hip being to &s;ail in ten days, in it Mr. Collins and I determined to embark. I told my ma&s;ter my re&s;olution, he did not di&s;uade me from it, becau&s;e it gave him the opportunity of getting the office I held to a kin&s;man of his, to whom that very day I delivered up my tru&s;t. And here provi|dence was no le&s;s remarkable to me than in other particulars of my life, for that night the pirates &s;iezed on the young man, while locking up the wards, took the keys from him, and left him for dead, and before the alarm could be given, five of them made their e&s;cape, by means of piratical boats that kept hovering about the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 18th of November, 1712, having made all my little preparations, I &s;ent my trunk aboard the No&s;tra Senora, Michael Deronza, ma&s;ter. The ve&s;&s;el was to &s;ail that evening, and about &s;even o'clock being &s;itting with Signor Ga&s;par, my ma&s;ter a lad came up and &s;aid the boat had been waiting for me and that Mr. Collins was on board. I ran into the hou&s;e for a &s;mall bundle and taking leave of the family, made what ha&s;te I could to the quay but found the boat had put off, and left word I &s;hould overtake them at a little bay. I ran along the &s;hore, and imagined I had a &s;ight of the boat, and

hallooed as loud as I could; they an&s;wered and put about to take me in: but we had &s;carce got fifty yards from land, when, on looking for Mr. Collins, I mi&s;&s;ed him; and then I found that in&s;tead of get|ting aboard my own boat, which I could &s;ee a con|&s;iderable way a-head, I had got into a boat belong|ing to the pirates. I attempted to leap overboard, but was prevented by one of the crew, who gave me a &s;troke on the head, which laid me &s;en&s;ele&s;s; and I found afterwards they mi&s;took me for one of their men, who had been &s;ent to purcha&s;e &s;omething in the town.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Pirates I continued &s;ome years, till they, upon a di&s;pute, threw me overboard. I was &s;aved by a boat belonging to a Spani&s;h &s;hip. After various misfortunes, our &s;hip was taken by an Al|gerine Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er, the greate&s;t part of the crew was kil|led, and the re&s;t taken pri&s;oners, among which I was one, having lo&s;t one of my legs in the action.</P>
<P>After this, I pa&s;&s;ed a long and painful &s;lavery in Algiers, till with other Engli&s;h captives, I was re|lea&s;ed by agreement between the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y of Algiers, and his Brittanick Maje&s;ty. In the year 1730. I re|turned to England. The fir&s;t thing I did was to enquire after my relations, but all tho&s;e neare&s;t to me were dead; and I found Mr. Collins had never returned home, &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e he died in his pa&s;&s;age. Though not an old man, I was &s;o enfeebled by hard&s;hips, that I was unable to work; and being without any manner of &s;upport, I could think of no way of getting my living but by begging.</P>
