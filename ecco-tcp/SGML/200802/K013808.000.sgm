<HEAD>SOME THOUGHTS UPON THE SUBJECT OF Commerce with <HI>FRANCE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Could by no means fore&s;ee when I formerly publi&s;h'd my Thoughts about TRADE, that it &s;hould come to be &s;o popular a Contro|ver&s;y, as it is now:</P>
<P>I am very glad however, as things have &s;ince hapned, That as my Opini|on of the Trade with <HI>France</HI> was always the &s;ame, and for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons that it is now; &s;o that I did put that Opi|nion in Print &s;o many times, and &s;o long
<PB N="4" REF="5">
ago, That I have left no room for Ma|lice it &s;elf, without &s;hameful prevarica|tion, to Charge me with having Chang'd my Hand or my Heart in the matters of Trade. The time will come, when I &s;hall make it appear as plain in other Matters al&s;o.</P>
<P>Six Year and Nine Year ago, and when the Mini&s;try who then Govern'd Affairs had Lock'd and Bar'd all the Doors of Trade again&s;t <HI>France,</HI>&mdash;I ven|tur'd to tell them in &s;o many Words, That <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Review, Vol. I, and Vol. IV. Pa. 318.</NOTE><HI>if they had been in their Trading Sences, they would have Traded with</HI> France <HI>all the while they Fought with</HI> France. I told them THEN plainly, That we Cheated the Nation of the Profits of an Advanta|geous Trade, by Prohibiting our <HI>Lead</HI> and our <HI>Corn</HI> going to <HI>France,</HI> under the Weak and Fooli&s;h Pretence, of not Sup|plying the Enemy with <HI>Bullets</HI> to &s;hoot at us; and not Supplying the Enemy with <HI>Corn</HI> for their Magazines; when at the &s;ame time we &s;old both our <HI>Lead</HI> and our <HI>Corn</HI> to the Neuteral Powers, who at a double Price &s;old them to <HI>France</HI>; &s;o that the Enemy got our <HI>Lead</HI> and our <HI>Corn</HI> for Bullets and Ma|gazines,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
and we only Cheated our &s;elves of the Profit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Review,</HI> Vol. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I Complain'd THEN, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> had the Wit to have an open Trade with <HI>France</HI> all the time of the War, and became thereby able to carry on that War, while at the &s;ame time they got from the <HI>French</HI> in Trade, part of that Money they &s;pent upon them in the Field; whereas we &s;hut our &s;elves out of the Trade and the Profits too, tho' we were able to get by it as well as they, and wanted the Gain as much as they.</P>
<P>I Publi&s;hed THEN in Print, an Account of a Calculation of the Gain we made from <HI>France,</HI> after the Peace of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> when by the Opinion of &s;ome Eminent Merchants then, and &s;till flou|ri&s;hing in <HI>London,</HI> and who can witne&s;s if they plea&s;e, on what foot this Cal|culation was made, this Nation Cleared 90000 Pounds <HI>per</HI> Month by the Trade to <HI>France</HI>; from whence came that won|derful Flux of <HI>French</HI> Pi&s;toles among us, which Supri&s;ed our People, and Rai&s;ed that ridiculous Clamour of the <HI>Oy&s;ter-Barrel,</HI> and of their being <HI>&s;ent over to</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
<HI>Bribe our Parliament Men.</HI> The truth of which was nothing but this, That our prodigious Export of Goods to <HI>France,</HI> &s;o much over-ballanc'd their Import upon us, that they were ob|lig'd to &s;upply the Ballance in Gold; the Parliament was oblig'd to reduce the &s;aid Pi&s;toles from 17<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> to 17<HI>s.</HI> and the quantity was &s;o great, that if our Accounts at that time did not err, above Eleven Hundred Thou&s;and of them were Melted down at the <HI>Tower,</HI> and Coin'd into Guineas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Review,</HI> Vol. 4. N. 55.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All the&s;e things, Gentlemen, I Print|ed in <HI>The Review,</HI> there they &s;tand as Witne&s;&s;es for or again&s;t me, if I have gone from my Opinion, chang'd my Sentiments of things, or Written again&s;t my &s;elf, let it appear; if I have not, why am I Cau&s;ele&s;ly Bullyed and In&s;ult|ed by vile Mercenaries, and Igno|rant Journey-men Scribblers, who&s;e Fa|thers, as <HI>Job</HI> &s;ays, were not fit to be &s;et with Dogs of the Flock; and who do it only becau&s;e they think they plea&s;e you in filling your Mouths with Scandal and Reproach: <HI>But further yet,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">The&s;e things, tho' Written again&s;t the late Mea&s;ures, and in the time of a Whig Government, They could hear then, and not Di&s;like, not Quarrel at, or In&s;ult me for Writing; If the Mini|&s;try them&s;elves found it cla&s;ht with their Proceedings, yet they were always &s;o Generous and &s;o Ju&s;t to me, as to allow me a freedom of &s;peech when I &s;poke my real Sentiments of things: Believing that I &s;poke what I thought I had good Ground to Support; and if they had not allowed me that Liberty, I &s;hould have ventur'd their Di&s;plea&s;ure and have taken it: The Day being yet to come that I ever withheld Speaking what I thought was needful to &s;ay, and what I knew I could Defend the Truth of, for fear of any Man's Face or Power in the World. Upon which Principle I &s;till act, as appears by my &s;tanding fa&s;t to my &s;aid Opinion, in a Time when it procures me &s;uch a Tumult of popular Rage, even among tho&s;e, who, I thought, had &s;ome rea&s;on to have u&s;ed me better.</P>
<P>But how comes it to pa&s;s that what I might &s;ay then with &s;o much freedom, I mu&s;t not &s;peak a Word of now? Whence comes this Change of your Ta&s;t!
<PB N="8" REF="9">
I affirm, and dare tell you, I can prove to your Faces, <HI>Trade is the &s;ame,</HI> there is not one Addition or Alteration to any part of the Trade, which does not more and more confirm what I &s;aid then, and make it ju&s;t to be &s;aid now. How comes it to pa&s;s that a Man could be a WHIG and &s;ay this Four, Five and Six year ago, and mu&s;t be a TORY if he &s;ays it <HI>Now!</HI> What Gentlemen! have you transferr'd your Rea&s;on and Judgment of things to the Tories! Are the Tories come down to make the right judgment of Trade, and are the Whigs gone from it! you will not allow this &s;ure! What then can be the mat|ter!</P>
<P>I'll tell you plainly the matter, and prove it when I have told it; The <HI>Party-&s;trife</HI> between the Gentlemen out of Power, and the Gentlemen in Power, has, <HI>Cur&s;ed be the Misfortune,</HI> hook'd in the Affair of Trade into the Quarrel, and your Commerce is now become a part of your Politicks.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of the thing, <HI>un|happily for the Nation,</HI> is this, That what&s;o|ever part the Publick Managers take, the private Party Managers oppo&s;e. It has hapned, that the Mini&s;try have made a
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Treaty of Commerce: Immediately a lowd Cry is rais'd again&s;t Trading with <HI>France,</HI> as if we were to continue the Interdiction of Commerce after the War was over, and were &s;till to have a War of Trade, tho' the War of State was at an end. Now, if you plea&s;e, let the Tables be turn'd, take it the other way; Had the Mini&s;try cho&s;en the other part, and made no Treaty of Commerce, I undertake to prove that it had been the &s;ame thing; and the &s;ame <HI>Lowd-Cry</HI> had been rai&s;ed, and that by the very &s;ame People, about Neg|lecting the matters of Trade, and ta|king no Care, when they made a Peace, to open the Trade again, as other of the Confederates had done for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;peak this Scandalous Truth: But the Fact is &s;o plain, and can be &s;o ea&s;ily proved, even upon Names, and Sir-names of Per&s;ons; and is already made &s;o publick by other hands, that my &s;aying it will be no di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do here, with any Remarks upon the&s;e Proceedings, there will be a time for it; but at pre&s;ent it &s;hews us by what Means, and for what Rea&s;on, with what View, and for what
<PB N="10" REF="11">
End, the Affair of Trade is Drag'd in, <HI>as it were,</HI> by the Hair of the Head, in|to the mi&s;erable <HI>Party-&s;trife</HI> which this Nation is Involv'd in.</P>
<P>By this Means, what I might have &s;aid Four year ago without any Re|proach, what I might Print then in the very teeth of a Mini&s;try then in Power without Di&s;plea&s;ing them, is made <HI>Party Trea&s;on</HI> to be &s;poken now; and that Liberty which I took, even at the hazard of Di&s;plea&s;ing the Govern|ment, I mu&s;t not be allow'd now, le&s;t it be a Service to the Government; and all this by Tumult, Rabble, and Roar|ing, not by Rea&s;on and Evidence.</P>
<P>But Ble&s;&s;ed be the Author of Truth, that has made it Eternal like him&s;elf, and as no Man ought to be AFRAID of &s;peaking truth; &s;o no Wi&s;e Man will ever be ASHAM'D of &s;peaking truth, however unpopular and di&s;obliging it may be, or to the Damage of what Party of Men &s;oever, provided only that it be &s;ea&s;onable nece&s;&s;ary Truth: And &s;uch is this I am upon, I am very &s;ure of it.</P>
<P>What has Trade to do with your Po|litick Squabbles, and what Bu&s;ine&s;s have Party Men with the Commerce of
<PB N="11" REF="12">
the Nation? Trade is neither <HI>Whig</HI> nor <HI>Tory, Church</HI> or <HI>Di&s;&s;enter, High-Church</HI> or <HI>Low-Church:</HI> In all the Broils and Tumults that have exerci&s;ed the&s;e un|happy Nations about <HI>Putting</HI> IN and <HI>Putting</HI> OUT, Trade has &s;tood always Neuter till now. There may have been Parties in the Pari&s;hes, in the Wardmotes, Common-Councils, and Common-Halls of the City, and &s;o up|ward to the Privy-Council, Convoca|tion and Parliament: But we never till now brought them upon the <HI>Exchange</HI>; there was never any <HI>Whig-walk</HI> and <HI>Tory-walk, High-Church-walk</HI> and <HI>Low-Church-Walk</HI> upon <HI>Change,</HI> that ever I knew of till now.</P>
<P>Certainly it is the Intere&s;t of the whole Nation to lay a&s;ide this part of the Strife: Parties have ruin'd our Peace, our Charity, our Society already, and almo&s;t our Religion too; If we let them Ruin our Trade al&s;o, What have we left? Well may the poor People wear Wooll in their Hats when they go to Vote for Parliament Men; I wi&s;h it may Direct them to chu&s;e &s;uch Men as may put a &s;peedy end to this Breach; for if Parties come to Govern our Trade, all our Commerce will be at an end,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
and by Con&s;equence our Woollen Ma|nufactures.</P>
<P>We &s;ee it every Day, and I believe neither Party will Deny it, That the Heats on both &s;ides, are &s;uch among our Parties, That, as if they re&s;olv'd to oppo&s;e one another in every thing Right or Wrong, what one Party propo&s;es, however Rational and Ju&s;t, the other will oppo&s;e, <HI>only becau&s;e the&s;e do it</HI>; and at another time, the &s;ame Party &s;hall e&s;pou&s;e the very thing which they op|po&s;ed, and be the Authors and Promo|ters of it them&s;elves. Let the Pa&s;&s;ing Bills in Parliament prove this: <HI>Both Parties</HI> have brought in the &s;ame Bills when they have been in <HI>Power,</HI> which they have Voted again&s;t when brought in by the other Party in the time of <HI>their</HI> being in <HI>Power: Take the alterna|tive,</HI> Both Parties have <HI>Voted again&s;t</HI> tho&s;e Bills when they have been <HI>out of Power,</HI> which they them&s;elves have brought in when they have been <HI>in Power:</HI> The Bills for quallifying Mem|bers, for Excluding Officers, for Regu|lating Elections, the Triennial, and the Occa&s;ional Bills, are all Evidences of what I &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">This is the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and when it will be otherwi&s;e God only knows: But run to what Extremes you plea&s;e, and pu&s;h your own Di&s;a&s;ters as far as you plea&s;e; I am re&s;olv'd, in all I &s;hall &s;ay on the Subject of Trade, to &s;peak of it as it ought to be &s;poken of <HI>(viz.)</HI> as a thing entirely unconcern'd with Parties, or with any of our Divi&s;ions, whether it be <HI>with</HI> or <HI>again&s;t</HI> popular Opinion, <HI>with</HI> or <HI>again&s;t</HI> tho&s;e People who I hope mean well, or <HI>with</HI> or <HI>again&s;t</HI> the Government or Mini&s;try is not the que&s;tion to me: What I &s;ay now, I &s;aid before, I al|ways &s;aid, and &s;ay again, <HI>If we are in our Trading Sen&s;es, we ought to open the Trade to</HI> France; and my Rea&s;on is the &s;ame as it was before, neither the Trade, or the Rea&s;on of the Trade, has &s;uffer'd the lea&s;t alteration, <HI>We ought to carry on the</HI> French <HI>Trade, becau&s;e we are able to do it to our Advantage</HI>; and we who are a Nation depending upon Trade, ought <HI>to Trade with every Nation we can get Money by.</HI></P>
<P>I hope no body will think &s;o gro&s;ly, as to &s;uppo&s;e that I &s;hould mean by this, That we ought to Trade to <HI>France,</HI> whether it be to our Advantage or no.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">It remains for me therefore to Exa|min next, upon what foot of Trade we now &s;tand with <HI>France,</HI> and how it ap|pears that the Trade may now be car|ried on to our Advantage?</P>
<P>I have nothing to do here with the Que&s;tion &s;o much Canva&s;s'd lately in Print between the Writers of both &s;ides <HI>(viz.)</HI> Whether the Trade to <HI>France</HI> was always to our Advantage or no? I acknowledge I was always of Opinion that it was not: I mean as to the Ballance of Trade. I was bred to the <HI>French</HI> Trade from a Youth and have known my &s;hare of the Particu|lars of it, and I know their Import was always very Heavy when our Duties upon them were Low, our Gu&s;t to their Wines, Brandy, Silks and Fa&s;hions High, and the Number of &s;orts of Goods Great, which we dealt with them in.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t own, &s;ince I have &s;een what has been alledg'd on both &s;ides, I am more enclin'd to think, that what has been &s;aid on that Side as to our for|mer Advantage by the Trade, is more probable than I thought it before; and I crave leave for a &s;mall Digre&s;&s;ion, to &s;hew what has &s;o enclin'd me: Not that
<PB N="15" REF="16">
I de&s;ign to enter into the Di&s;pute about it at all; but meerly hint at what I have Ob&s;erv'd in it, which I had not Con&s;ider'd before.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allow'd, that our Expor|tations to <HI>France</HI> in Woollen Manu|factures were very great; I will not enter into particulars here, they are Publi&s;h'd on both &s;ides many times over: Be&s;ides the Woollen Goods, our Allom, Corn, Fi&s;h, Lead, Shot, Ca&s;t-Iron, Wrought Iron and Bra&s;s, Block-Tin, Pewter, Skins, Druggs, Coal, but e&s;pecially Leather, ri&s;e up to very great Sums.</P>
<P>Our Forreign Trade, or what is call'd Exports by Certificate, were likewi&s;e very great, and oftentimes much greater than any of the Accounts I have yet &s;een Printed; <HI>(viz.)</HI> our Plantation Goods; &s;uch as, Sugars, Cottons, In|dico, Ginger, Pimento, Tobacco; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Our <HI>Ea&s;t-India, Turkey,</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-India</HI> Goods, as Cochenele, Indico, Gauls, Dyers Woods, Cotton-Yarn, Grograms, Oyl, <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wooll; as al&s;o Elephants Teeth, Bees-wax, Drugs and the like.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e are not allow'd to Ba|lance the Imports from <HI>France,</HI> as I &s;ay
<PB N="16" REF="17">
again, I thought always they did not; yet the two following Circum&s;tances which I borrow from another Publick hand, do incline me to believe they might; and this is all I &s;hall &s;ay to what is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e Circum&s;tances are, (1.) The Carrying on the whole Trade in our own Shipping, the Advantage of which I mu&s;t acknowledge. (2.) The Ad|vance of the Price of the Goods &s;ent from hence to <HI>France,</HI> which are for the mo&s;t part-&s;old upon the Account of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stocks.</P>
<P>I have &s;een what is &s;ugge&s;ted by others on the&s;e Heads, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the <HI>French</HI> are &s;o encrea&s;ed in Shipping, that they will now bring their own Goods hither, and that as much of the Trade is carried on by Commi&s;&s;ion from <HI>France</HI> hither, as by Commi&s;&s;ion from hence to <HI>France,</HI> which are to me of no force, nor is it true in Fact: The Dra|pers in <HI>Cornhill</HI> will readily te&s;tify in the Linen Trade, which is the Ca&s;e alledged, That they always gave Com|mi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Morlaix</HI> for their <HI>Dowlas</HI> and <HI>Lockrams.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">As to our Freight out being Carried for a &s;mall Matter, it is true it was &s;o, in &s;uch Ships as went for Wines for what Goods they could get: But as the Bulk of our Goods went to Ports which the Wine and Brandy did not come from, and from Ports in <HI>England</HI> which the Wine and Brandy did not come to, this cannot be the Ca&s;e; our Corn, Coal, and Lead goes chiefly to <HI>Dunkirk, Roan, Diep,</HI> and other Ports of <HI>Normandy,</HI> from whence no Wines are brought.</P>
<P>But I am not Di&s;puting with any body; I am neither to Defend the <HI>Mercator,</HI> or Con|fute the <HI>Briti&s;h Merchant,</HI> let them fight on their own way; I am giving my own Thoughts only, which I &s;hall do as Impar|tially as I can.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t Ingeniou&s;ly acknowledge, that I formerly received my Opinion of the Bal|lance of the <HI>French</HI> Trade being 800000<HI>l. per An.</HI> to our Lo&s;s, from the Accounts given then about Town, and into Parliament, when I my &s;elf was in Trade; which made it be receiv'd at that time as a Common Opinion, and as &s;uch I Printed it in the <HI>Review,</HI> which &s;ome People are mighty well plea&s;ed to quote upon me now; and this Common Opinion was Derived from the Paper which pa&s;t for Cur|rent Truth in tho&s;e Times, called, <HI>A Scheme, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But I have really been amazed to &s;ee that Scheme detected of &s;uch manife&s;t Fraud, proved to be wholly fal&s;e, and de&s;ignedly to be Impo&s;ed upon the Nation, even to &s;tripping it &s;tark naked from all manner of
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Covering; and not one Word &s;aid in its De|fence; So that the Authors on that Side are careful to publi&s;h that they had no hand in it. Vide <HI>Briti&s;h Merchant,</HI> N. 14. Upon the&s;e things, Can any man blame me then that I acknowledge the Error, which I, among other People, fell into by taking that Account for True? And that I am not now of the Opinion, that the Trade to <HI>France</HI> was &s;o much to our Lo&s;s as I then Printed it to be?</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Circum&s;tances which, I &s;ay, have enclin'd me to believe, that our Trade to <HI>France</HI> fully Ballanced our Trade from <HI>France</HI> in former times.</P>
<P>If any Man Sugge&s;ts that private Ends and Advantages have bya&s;s'd my Opinion, That Sugge&s;tion is Fal&s;e and Malicious; I Con|temn the Slander, and Defy them to prove the lea&s;t Circum&s;tance of it.</P>
<P>But the Face of things is now Chang'd, the Trade looks quite another way ever &s;ince the fir&s;t War, and whatever it might be before, it is certain that NOW the Trade to <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t be to our Advantage, and that prodigi|ou&s;ly, compar'd to what it was: And this is the Rea&s;on, that it has ever &s;ince that time been my &s;tated Opinion, and I have always Profe&s;&s;ed it, and Printed it, That it is our Wi&s;dom to open the Trade to <HI>France</HI> for the time to come, and nothing but Stupi|dity and a Trade-Madne&s;s can prevent it: This, I &s;ay, is the Rea&s;on for the alteration of my Opinion in that Ca&s;e, without the lea&s;t private view, or the lea&s;t regard to who is for or again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">I cannot but think, if Men were enclin'd to do me any Ju&s;tice, either in this or any thing el&s;e; That my having Printed this, as my Opinion &s;everal times, and &s;everal years ago, before any Parties concern'd them&s;elves about it, ought to Defend me again&s;t the Malice of tho&s;e who &s;ugge&s;t my doing it now upon the Influence of others: But Rea|&s;on and Ju&s;tice are not Lowd enough to be heard in the Noi&s;e and Clamour of this Day, Time will make Men Cooler, and I mu&s;t wait till then.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion therefore now before us is very &s;hort and plain, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Whether it is our Intere&s;t to open a Trade to <HI>France?</HI> And whether we &s;hall be Gainers by it, if we do it on the Terms of the Treaty of Commerce which is now propo&s;ed to us? I &s;hall &s;peak only my own Thoughts of it.</P>
<P>I have Examin'd as Nicely as I can the whole Treaty; I will not &s;ay, that &s;everal things might not have been added to it to make it more to our Advantage than it is: But the que&s;tion then will be, Whether it was Rational to Expect greater Advantages could be &s;ubmitted to by the <HI>French?</HI> If, indeed, we had been Ma&s;ters of <HI>France,</HI> and had only one &s;ide of a Treaty to make, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;et down what Terms the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould be obliged to yield to, without Conceding any thing to them on our part; then it &s;hould not have been a Treaty, but an Act of Parliament, Enacting in what manner the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould Trade with us; as we do with <HI>Ireland</HI>; which had it been our
<PB N="20" REF="21">
Ca&s;e, I &s;hould have taxt the Mini&s;try with great Indolence and Neglect of our Intere&s;t, that they had not forb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d the <HI>French</HI> making any kind, of Woollen Manufacture at-all, and taken off all Duties on the Impor|tation of ours: They &s;hould have cau&s;ed all Woollen Manufactures from <HI>Holland, Flan|ders, Germany, Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> &amp;c. to have been Prohibited, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They &s;hould have cau&s;ed the <HI>French</HI> to &s;end no more Ships to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies, Turkey,</HI> or <HI>Canada,</HI> and have cau&s;ed <HI>Martinico</HI> and <HI>Quebec</HI> to have been &s;urrendred to us, as they did <HI>Newfoundland</HI> and St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers.</HI></P>
<P>I do acknowledg the&s;e are all Articles, in which the Treaty of Commerce might have been made better than it is.</P>
<P>They might al&s;o have Continued all the high Duties on <HI>French</HI> Goods in <HI>England</HI> as they now &s;tand, and which are in the nature of Prohibitions, and made the whole Coa&s;t of <HI>France</HI> a Free Port to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and many other things might have been done.</P>
<P>But take the Treaty as a Convention be|tween two Nations, in which we were to provide for the Equity and Ju&s;tice of Trade, to &s;ettle the Equallities of Commerce between them, with due regard to the Proportions of Things, and the Circum&s;tances of the re|&s;pective Nations, for the Accomodation of the Subjects of both; and either Nation being Free, and without Dependance upon the other; I &s;ay, if we take the Treaty thus, as really it ought to be taken, I mu&s;t Confe&s;s, and I mu&s;t Speak my Mind freely and plainly, whoever it offends, I do not &s;ee how the Treaty could be made
<PB N="21" REF="22">
between the two Nations, upon more equal terms than it is; if I did, I &s;hould not be backward to &s;peak it.</P>
<P>Nay, on the contrary, I do think, That the <HI>French</HI> King has &s;truck &s;uch a blow by this Treaty to the Manufactures of Wooll among his own People, that if he &s;tands long to the Conditions of it, all the Undertakers of Woollen Manufactures in <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t be Ruin'd and Undone.</P>
<P>It might indeed have taken away &s;ome of the Clamour at this Treaty, if there had been &s;ome little Advantage given to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine Trade; but when I remember how the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade &s;tood for|merly, when I was concern'd in them both, how the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Wines, paid above Eight Pound <HI>per</HI> Ton Cu&s;tom, more than the <HI>French,</HI> and that now the <HI>French</HI> are brought to an equallity. I mu&s;t allow that it is a large &s;tep in Favour of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade, and what mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily leave the &s;aid <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade in a better Condition than it was in before the War.</P>
<P>Nor can it be po&s;&s;ible, that what &s;ome People &s;ay, on that Head, can be true, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> will, on the Breach of this Article, e&s;teem the Peace broke, and will prohibit our Manufactures: The People who Argue &s;o, di&s;cover, that they know but little of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade; the encrea&s;e of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade is known to all the World, and the occa&s;ion of it al&s;o is known, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Encrea&s;e of their Trade to the <HI>Bra|&s;ils</HI>: This is not only carried on with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Goods, but with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stocks al&s;o; and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants of <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> &s;end great quantities of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods to the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> upon Account and Ri&s;qs of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants at <HI>London,</HI> and upon their own Ac|counts, or el&s;e Tru&s;t the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Merchants with tho&s;e Goods; to receive their Effects at the Return of the Fleets from the <HI>Bra&s;ils</HI>; &s;o that without the help of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stocks, as well as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, it would be but a poor Trade that is carried on to the <HI>Bra&s;ils.</HI></P>
<P>From hence it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that the Danger of Prohibiting our Woollen Manufactures in <HI>Portugal,</HI> is of no con&s;equence; nor could they carry on the <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> Trade, or indeed their own Trade, without our Goods; nor have they much Rea&s;on to complain, when upon a general Set|tlement of the Peace and Trade of <HI>Europe,</HI> Trade &s;hould be left to run in the &s;ame Chan|nel which it u&s;ed to run in, &s;ince they are put therein upon an even foot of Cu&s;toms with the <HI>French,</HI> whereas before they paid near 9.<HI>l. per</HI> Ton Cu&s;tome more than the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>I know the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have a Treaty, in which another kind of Proportion is &s;ettled, and much pains is taken, to magnify the Sacred Obligation of this Treaty; but &s;uch Treaties, mu&s;t all, as the pre&s;ent Treaty is, be &s;ubject to the Determination of Parliament, otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t be true as the <HI>Mercator</HI> has alledg'd, That we &s;hall give the Prerogative a Power which it does not pretend to, and put it into the Hands of a &s;ingle Agent, Envoy, or Plenipotentiary, to Repeal Laws, and Limit the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> as to what they &s;hall,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
or &s;hall not, do; and as to what Duties they &s;hall, or &s;hall not continue, if laid on, or lay on anew; which I acknowledge is an Autho|rity De&s;tructive of the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titu|tion, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the very being of Parliament.</P>
<P>If a Treaty with <HI>Portugal</HI> is made, which goes this length, it is void in its own Nature, and is no Treaty at all; and if the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try had made &s;uch a Treaty with <HI>France,</HI> the Parliament would not have been bound by it, and indeed could not, without giving up the Peoples Liberties which they are en|tru&s;ted with.</P>
<P>The&s;e are indeed but my private Thoughts, nor do I regard, in them, what has been &s;aid by others on this Head, on either &s;ide; I &s;ay it again, All Treaties, &s;o far as they re&s;pect the laying on, or taking off, of tho&s;e Duties and Taxes, mu&s;t be Subject to Parliamentary Authority, or el&s;e we give up Parliaments to the Prerogative, and revive that fatal Exer|ci&s;e of it, the DISPENSING POWER, which I hope never to &s;ee done in <HI>Britain,</HI> e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who E&s;pou&s;e the Revolu|tion Principle.</P>
<P>Al&s;o &s;uch Treaties ought to be Subject to the General Treaty for &s;ettling the Tran|quility of <HI>Europe</HI>; and as it has been thought fit to make &s;ome alteration in that Treaty, if the Parliament &s;hall confirm tho&s;e Altera|tions, I cannot &s;ee that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> ought to think it unju&s;t, becau&s;e he ought to have con&s;idered when he made that Treaty, whether the Per&s;ons did not Capitulate with
<PB N="24" REF="25">
him, for what they had no Power to make Good; and if by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, they had not Power to make it Good, he ought not to be offended, that we do not give up that Con&s;titution to oblige him; I am &s;orry to &s;ee &s;ome People, who a few Years pa&s;t, &s;hew'd &s;uch commendable Zeal for the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, be willing now to Sacri|fice it to a Treaty, who&s;e Conditions made by a private Mini&s;ter, exceed the Power that either he really had, or, that they who em|ploy'd him, were able to give him.</P>
<P>On the other hand, That the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> &s;hall immediately look on the Infracti|on of this Treaty, as an In&s;ult, and a Breach of the Peace, and the like, and &s;hould there|upon prohibit our Manufactures of every kind, which indeed is Prohibiting Commerce with us, and con&s;equently, Declaring War. This I cannot, per&s;wade my &s;elf of, for this would be an open Defiance, and I am &s;atisfied the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> has too much Sen&s;e of the Equity of things, to break with <HI>England</HI> on that ac|count; or if he &s;hould have &s;o little Wit, <HI>England</HI> may find Ways and Means to reduce the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> to Rea&s;on, and to re&s;ettle the Trade again to our Satisfaction; or el&s;e <HI>Portugal</HI> is repre&s;ented to be a much more Potent Prince than I take him to be. The King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> if the Debate about the Peace between him and <HI>Spain</HI> continue, is like to &s;tand in too much need of the Councils and A&s;&s;i&s;tance which <HI>Britain</HI> is in condition to yield him; I &s;ay, too much to &s;uffer him to break with <HI>Britain</HI> on &s;o trivial an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">I cannot but think our People give too much weight to the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> in this ca&s;e, and make the <HI>Portugal</HI> Nation &s;eem to carry a greater Poi&s;e in the Ballance and Trade of <HI>Europe,</HI> than their Circum&s;tances allow, ma|king <HI>England</HI> &s;o much oblig'd to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> as to be afraid of their Prohibiting our Trade, as if they were not at all concern'd, to have their Wine, their Oyl, and their Fruit &s;hut out of <HI>England,</HI> altho' they know if it &s;hould be &s;o, they are quite undone.</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t the le&s;s on this, becau&s;e I &s;ee it in debate by other hands; but I mu&s;t own I cannot but wonder to &s;ee People lay, as it were, the whole &s;tre&s;s of their Arguments upon a Treaty with <HI>Portugal,</HI> which if it &s;hould be granted, to be &s;o &s;acred would be a dreadful Precedent for this Nation, in Giving up our Parliament, our Privileges, and our Con&s;titution, to the Power of the Mini&s;try, and enable them to tye up the Parliaments hands, by what-ever little Bargains they may make Abroad, pretending that They, (the Court,) have agreed that it &s;hall be &s;o and &s;o.</P>
<P>I would calmly entreat &s;uch Men to reflect a little, how oddly it would &s;ound in the Ears of all the Ancient Patriots of the Re|volution, and the Defenders of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Li|berty, If they were now alive, to have a Mini&s;ter of State &s;tand up in the Hou&s;e of Commons, when a Money-Bill was before them, and &s;ay, Mr. Speaker,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We cannot lay any farther Duty on &s;uch and &s;uch Goods from <HI>Portugal,</HI> for her Maje&s;ty has made a Treaty to the Contrary: And Mr. Speaker,

<P>Let us but compare this with the Language of our Con&s;titution to be found in <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> Sir <HI>Ed.

<P>I &s;hall make no farther Reflections on this Ca&s;e; We are to be very Thankful that our Liberties are fix'd, and very Careful that we do not undermine them with our own hands.</P>
<P>If the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try had taken Mr. <HI>Me|thuen</HI> for their Precedent, and quoted my Lord <HI>N&mdash;</HI> for their Authority, and had ab&s;olutely &s;tipulated with the King of <HI>France</HI> to take off &s;uch and &s;uch Duties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as by the Ninth Ar|ticle of this pre&s;ent Treaty is Expre&s;&s;ed; and had not left it to the Determination of the Par|liament to whom it belongs, What would the&s;e People have &s;aid then? And how might
<PB N="27" REF="28">
the Mini&s;try have referr'd them back to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Treaty for their Ju&s;tification?</P>
<P>The&s;e things Clear up to me the Objection again&s;t the Treaty of Commerce which is Drawn from the <HI>Portugal</HI> Treaty, I do not by this re&s;olve the Que&s;tion, Whether it is pro|per to break in upon this <HI>Portugal</HI> Treaty, in order to make the pre&s;ent Treaty Effectual? Let no Man mi&s;take, or &s;train my Words be|yond what I lay down as my expre&s;s mean|ing; I &s;hall &s;peak to that by it &s;elf: But I &s;ay this, with re&s;pect to the whole Treaty with <HI>Portugal,</HI> which I am not at all backward to declare my Opinion of, and the Rea&s;ons for it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That I think it cannot be ju&s;tified; Tho&s;e who made it ought, if they had been living, to have an&s;wer'd for it.</P>
<P>I come back to the main Subject, and to my Rea&s;ons as above, why I always was of the Opinion, That we ought to have kept open our Trade with <HI>France, (viz.)</HI> Becau&s;e we could get by the Trade; and that we ought to Trade with every Nation we can get Money by.</P>
<P>I think I need &s;pend no time to prove the latter, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That we ought to Trade with every Nation we can get Money by. We are a Nation which Depends upon our Com|merce, and our whole Pro&s;perity, Wealth and Sub&s;i&s;tance depends upon it, the Landed Intere&s;t not excepted, who&s;e Rents would &s;oon be reduc'd to &s;uch a Condition as to &s;tarve the Landlords as well as the Tenants, a few of higher Dimen&s;ions than ordinary excepted, if our Commerce &s;hould fail:
<PB N="28" REF="29">
This Commerce is &s;upported and maintained principally by our Woollen Manufacture, which is &s;o Con&s;iderable and E&s;&s;ential to it, that &s;hould we have no more a free Export, or a Vent Abroad for our Manufactures, the Import we make from Abroad would &s;o over|ballance us from all parts of the World, that we &s;hould immediately be exhau&s;ted of all our Specie, and the other Produce of our Country would &s;carce feed us: For this Rea|&s;on, nothing but a blindne&s;s, which no Na|tion but ours was ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, would have led us to be acce&s;&s;ary to the &s;topping the Exportation of our own Manufactures, as has been done by Prohibitions of Trade whether to <HI>France,</HI> or to any other part of the World.</P>
<P>I know it has been Objected, That if we had not, the <HI>French</HI> would: To which I an|&s;wer, then the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould, it was not our bu&s;ine&s;s to have done it fir&s;t, to Prohibit our own Goods, becau&s;e if we did not the <HI>French</HI> would, is Dying for fear of Death, and like a Man Hanging him&s;elf, becau&s;e he is in danger of being Condemn'd to be Hang'd.</P>
<P>Our bu&s;ine&s;s had been to have Loaded the <HI>French</HI> Goods here with &s;uch Duties as might have &s;ecur'd their Importations from hurting us, and to have left our Woollen Manufacture Free to be Carried to <HI>France,</HI> or any where el&s;e, as long as ever they would have bought a piece of them; and if they mu&s;t have been Prohibited, it had been the King of <HI>France</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s to have Prohibited them, not ours. It is our bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ell our Woollen Manu|factures
<PB N="29" REF="30">
to every body in the World that would buy them; becau&s;e the Produce of our Land, the Labour of the Poor, the Con|&s;umption of Foreign Imported Goods which are the Returns of them, is all carried on by it, and depends upon it: In &s;hort, we ought to Trade with every Nation we can Gain by, becau&s;e the Gain of our Trade is the E&s;&s;en|tial Article on which the Wealth of the Na|tion depends.</P>
<P>Having lay'd down this Foundation, it follows to prove that we can, and may Gain by the Trade to <HI>France:</HI> This mu&s;t be proved, by proving that the vallue of our Exportation to <HI>France,</HI> with its Appendices, and additional Circum&s;tances, &s;hall exceed the vallue of our Imports from <HI>France</HI>; and this is proved by two Circum&s;tances which attend our Trade now, which did not attend it before the War. <LIST>
<ITEM>1. The &s;everal Kinds of Manufactures which we are now Ma&s;ters of, and make ei|ther wholly, or in Part among our &s;elves, which we formerly Imported from <HI>France.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Loading the other Goods which we &s;hall Import from <HI>France,</HI> with &s;uch heavy Duties as mu&s;t ntce&s;&s;arily le&s;&s;en their Con|&s;umption.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>There are other Rea&s;ons to be given of le&s;s moment; but the&s;e are the Two main Rea|&s;ons which will prove our Imports to be very con&s;iderably abated.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">There was no other Rea&s;on ever given, or indeed could be given, why we &s;hould not Trade with <HI>France</HI> but this, That we Im|ported &s;uch unrea&s;onable quantities of their Goods, that infinitely over-ballanc'd what they took from us. Whether this was &s;o or not, is not my que&s;tion, I have &s;poken of that before; But whether it &s;hall be &s;o for the fu|ture?</P>
<P>Let any Man inform him&s;elf how much, in a probable Calculation of things, that Con&s;umption of <HI>French</HI> Goods will be le&s;&s;ened by the quantities of their &s;everal Manufa|ctures which we make here, and if he will be ju&s;t, he will find them very Con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>They are under a very great Mi&s;take, who think the Wine and the Brandy are the only Con&s;iderable Articles which weighed down the Scale of Trade to the <HI>French</HI> &s;ide, there were &s;everal &s;ingle Articles which very much exceeded the Wine Trade.</P>
<P>The Accounts which tho&s;e who argue again&s;t this Trade &s;hew to the World, and which are publi&s;h'd in Print, make the Linen Imported from <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> amount to 600000 Pound, and they tell us the <HI>Lockrams</HI> and <HI>Dowla&s;s</HI> alone amounted to by the &s;ame Account, Three Hundred and Sixty Thou&s;and Pounds; the wrought Silks Imported in one year, they make to amount to Three Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds, where|as by the &s;ame Account the <HI>French</HI> Wine is made to Amount to but 137500 Pounds, and the Brandy amounts to but 70000 Pounds; the Paper, they &s;ay amounts to 40000 Pounds, and the like,</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">I am not Examining here, whether the&s;e Accounts are true are not, it is manife&s;t they are not; if they are fal&s;e, then they will not make out the Ballance which they are brought to prove; if they are true, they will Confirm the Argument I am upon: For the&s;e Great and Capital Articles are all in a manner de&s;troy'd, and cannot be recover'd, tho' the Treaty now in &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;hould take place.</P>
<P>The Silk Trade is gon, the Importations of one Part, <HI>(viz.) Alamodes</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;trings</HI> is entirely &s;topt, the Weavers them&s;elves gave it up before the Hou&s;e of Commons; the Duty which is upon them, and which mu&s;t continue upon them is, <HI>l.</HI> 1. 11. 6. <HI>per</HI> C. Weight, and is &s;o great as utterly De&s;troys the Trade; not a Piece can be Imported to any Advantage, and take away the Profit of a Trade, you take away Trade; there can|not a Piece be Sold here, but what mu&s;t be Run on Shoar by &s;tealth; and if we cannot prevent that, it will be our own fault.</P>
<P>The other part of the Silk Trade is re|duc'd by Two things: 1. By the Improve|ments which our own Weavers have made in the Broad-Weaving Trade, which, &s;ince the Encouragement given them by Prohibiting the Wearing of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Silk, is &s;o very great, that the <HI>French</HI> can never out-do them. 2. By the Duty of 12<HI>s. per</HI> Pound Weight, which is &s;till to remain upon the <HI>French</HI> Silks even by this Treaty: Under both which Circum&s;tances, the Importation of <HI>French</HI> Wrought Silks will be very Low. I know it
<PB N="32" REF="33">
is Calculated in a publick Paper, to amount to between Fourty and Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds a Year; but I have Rea&s;on to believe, and am Confirm'd in my Judgment by Men of Experience in that Trade, That it will be very little, except what they may endeavour to get in privately by &s;tealing the Duty, which as I &s;ay above, if we cannot hinder, it will be our own fault.</P>
<P>I might give many Rea&s;ons to prove, that the Importation of Linen from <HI>France,</HI> which is the princpal Article of their Importations, will likewi&s;e be cut &s;hort; and after having hinted the Encouragement given to the Linen Manufacture in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the very great quan|tity of Cour&s;e Tabling made in <HI>Lanca&s;hire, We&s;tmoreland, Durham</HI> and <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> the thin <HI>Diapers</HI> and other Linen brought now free of Duty from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the more than u&s;ual quantity of Cour&s;e Linen made in &s;everal parts of <HI>England,</HI> be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, itmay be ob&s;ervable, that whereas <HI>they &s;ay</HI> we Imported 60000 Pieces of <HI>Lockrams</HI> and <HI>Dowla&s;s</HI> from <HI>France</HI> in a Year, there has not been Imported one Sixth Part of that Quantity one Year with another, of <HI>Hambro Dowla&s;s,</HI> or of all the other kinds of Cloth which have been &s;up|po&s;ed to an&s;wer to the U&s;es which the <HI>French</HI> Linen was applied to; this mu&s;t evedently Demon&s;trate that the gro&s;s of the quantity is made at home.</P>
<P>The Undertakers of the Manufacture of <HI>Sail-Cloth</HI> in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> may an&s;wer for me, how much they &s;hall abate the Im|portation of <HI>Vitre, Pertree,</HI> and <HI>Noyels Can|va&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="34">
with which we u&s;ed to be &s;upplied from <HI>France,</HI> for making of Sails, and if they may be Credited, they pretend to be able to make the whole Quantity; to which purpo&s;e, if the pre&s;ent Duties on the <HI>French</HI> are not high enough, and will not give them an Advan|tage of the <HI>French,</HI> &s;ufficient to encourage and &s;upport their Work, on their Repre&s;ent|ing the &s;ame to the Parliament, no doubt they may have farther and higher Duties laid on, from which the Parliament are not at all Limited or Re&s;train'd by this Treaty.</P>
<P>I might go on to &s;peak of other Articles, as of the Paper, the Encrea&s;e of Di&s;tilling, the making of Gla&s;s, and &s;everal other things, all which joyn to le&s;&s;en our Demand of Goods from <HI>Franee,</HI> by the finding ways to &s;upply the Con&s;umption at Home: But I think the&s;e are &s;ufficient to an&s;wer for an abatement &s;o Con&s;iderable, as would make the Argument good, &s;eeing I am a&s;&s;ured by tho&s;e who&s;e Judgment and Experience I e&s;teem better than my own, That we &s;hall not Import in each of tho&s;e two Heads, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Silk and the Linen, &s;o much by a prodigious Sum, as they have given an account of to have been formerly Imported.</P>
<P>The laying on high Duties, and tho&s;e Du|ties le&s;&s;ening the Con&s;umption of other Goods, is the next Article, and might take up &s;ome of our time here, but I find it is &s;poken to by other Hands; the thing is &s;o natural none can deny it, There cannot be the &s;ame quantity of Brandy Imported when it is to pay upwards of 50<HI>l. per</HI> Ton Cu&s;tom,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
as would be, or was, when it paid but 30<HI>s.</HI> altho' the Di&s;tilling of Malt Spirits were not to be &s;poken of. The like of the Wines.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Rea&s;ons on one Part, why I think it will for ever be true, that we may Trade with <HI>France</HI> to our Advantage, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That their Importations to us cannot be &s;o great by a very great Sum, as they u&s;ually were in the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II.</P>
<P>I come now to the Exportation of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods to <HI>France,</HI> and I mu&s;t acknowledg that I go in this Part, upon a Foundation which is to me very &s;atisfactory, tho' perhaps not Di&s;|cern'd by every one that Con&s;iders it.</P>
<P>Our Manufactures, which formerly were loaded in <HI>France</HI> with Extravagant high Du|ties, and at la&s;t with a total Prohibition, are now to be Freely Imported into <HI>France,</HI> pay|ing no other Duties than as by the Tariff of 1664, which is about Ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> and with a &s;mall Exception to the Woollen Clothes, and Cloth-Serges, which are to pay as by the Tariff of 1699.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t let in our Manufactures into <HI>France</HI> in a full &s;tream, and open a Door for a greater Con&s;umption of them in <HI>France</HI> than ever was before; and this, I &s;ay, is the Rea|&s;on on the other &s;ide, why I pretend to prove we &s;hall now be Gainers by the <HI>French</HI> Trade: For if the only Exception again&s;t the Trade, is that of their over-ballancing our Export, if then I prove that their Export to us &s;hall now Le&s;&s;en, and our Export to them &s;hall now Encrea&s;e, &s;o that we &s;hall for the future over-ballance them, then my Argument mu&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="36">
be Good, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That we ought to Trade with them.</P>
<P>It is brought as an Objection, and it is all the Objection that can be brought in the Ca&s;e, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the <HI>French</HI> make all our Manu|factures now as well as we do, and therefore will not want ours any more. Nay, &s;o warm are &s;ome People to have this believed, that they affirm, tho' I doubt without Evidence, That they make as good Cloth in <HI>France</HI> as we do; and as good Serges and Perpets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in &s;uch Quantities to, as that they can &s;upply all the World; nay, and &s;upply us to, if we will give them leave.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen beg the Que&s;tion very peremptorily, and Demand that we &s;hould &s;trangely take them upon Tru&s;t: But the matter of Fact has never yet been proved, and this is not an Age to believe Men on their Words, in things of &s;uch a nature, when Parties bya&s;s Men &s;o much to &s;train their Principles, as we &s;ee is the Ca&s;e every day.</P>
<P>It has been ask'd in Publick by one Paper, and I mu&s;t ask it here; it is &s;o natural, it cannot be &s;trange if every Man, we talk with &s;hould ask it,&mdash;Where is this Fine Cloth and good Woollen Manufacture that the <HI>French</HI> make? where do they hide it? How comes it to pa&s;s that none of the Gentlemen who come over hither have any of it ON? Let the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador be a Te&s;t of this; or any other <HI>French</HI> Man that comes over, look on their Clothes, their Liveries, their Coaches. The <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador cannot take it for an affront, <HI>that we &s;ay,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Servant to a
<PB N="36" REF="37">
private Gentleman, would have thought him|&s;elf very ill u&s;ed to have been Clothed in &s;uch Trappings; How Cour&s;e, How Ru&s;ty the Black, How Spungy, how Nappy and Rough the Clothes, How ill made, How wor&s;e Dre&s;s'd, and How wor&s;t of all the Wooll of the Clothes they appear'd at fir&s;t in! The <HI>Engli&s;h Colche&s;ter Bays</HI> would have look'd bet|ter than &s;ome of them look'd. If the&s;e are the Manufactures they boa&s;t of, I &s;hall never fear, but when our Woollen Clothes, Stuffs, Serges and other Goods come among them at rea&s;onable Rates for the Cu&s;toms and Duties, they will make their own way, and &s;hew the <HI>French</HI> that they are not able to make our Ma|nufacture to any perfection.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, by tho&s;e who Object again&s;t it, That they have our Wooll, and have gotten Work|men from hence, and their People Work Cheaper than ours can do, and why &s;hould they not make our Manufactures as good as we do?</P>
<P>This I de&s;ire to Explain upon a little, and I &s;hall leave my Opinion to the Judgment of tho&s;e, who are Impartial, if any &s;uch are left among us; as for tho&s;e who will not judge Impartially, who <HI>will</HI> have it be, as they <HI>would</HI> have it be; and that will admit no Ar|gument but their own po&s;itive affirming a thing, the&s;e Sheets &s;hall not meddle with them, nothing but Experience can deal with &s;uch, and they are never Convinc'd till they are made a&s;ham'd.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>French</HI> getting Wooll from <HI>Eng|land</HI> it is too true, that they get great quan|tities of Wooll both from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="38">
ever have done &s;o, and I doubt ever will do &s;o; How to have it prevented I do not undertake to &s;ay, It is like the Di&s;temper of the Gout in the Body, which every Body has a Medicine for, and no body can Cure.</P>
<P>As to getting Workmen from <HI>England, I will not &s;ay but</HI> That may be True al&s;o, tho' we have not &s;een it proved; take that with you too; Traytors to their Country are al|ways to be had, who for a Mor&s;el of Bread will do any thing; and as there is no Law to puni&s;h them, and they are out of reach al&s;o, we mu&s;t always be Content.</P>
<P>But neither of the&s;e can come into the Party-que&s;tion: The Government can no more hinder Men going over to <HI>France</HI> to teach the Clothworkers how to Dre&s;s their Cloth, than they can hinder Men going to Li&s;t in Foreign Armies. The New Mini&s;try can no more hinder the Exporting of Wooll, than the Old Mini&s;try could; I believe they would willingly hearken to any means that would be effectual, and &s;o would the la&s;t Mi|ni&s;try have done; but both have been tyred with the Quacking of Projectors, who have always Worried Innocent Men, Conniv'd at Rogues, and left the Di&s;ea&s;e wor&s;e than they found it.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall undertake to prove two things here, that &s;hall Confound all this Notion: (1.) That neither the Workmen, or the Wooll, will effectually an&s;wer for making our Woollen Manufacture. (2.) That neither the <HI>French,</HI> or any Nation in the World do, or can, Work Cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> both can and do.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">From the&s;e Principles I in&s;i&s;t upon it, That the <HI>French</HI> cannot make our Woollen Manu|factures &s;o as to prevent the Sale of ours, when a Trade &s;hall be opened by taking off the Duties, as by the Tariff of 1664. but that on the Contrary, our Goods coming among them &s;hall be &s;o much better, and in proportion to that goodne&s;s &s;o much Cheaper, that they &s;hall in time de&s;troy all their Un|dertakings of Woollen Manufacture, and en|crea&s;e the Con&s;umption of ours: On this account, joyn'd to what I have &s;aid before, it is, that I &s;ay we may gain by the <HI>French</HI> Trade, and is therefore another Rea&s;on why we ought to Trade with them.</P>
<P>The Original or Foundation of the Manu|facture is the Wooll; the fir&s;t &s;tep to the Working this Wooll, is the Sorting, Comb|ing, Carding, and Preparing the Wooll: The fir&s;t, <HI>to wit,</HI> the Sorting the Wooll, re|quires Judgment and Experience in the Ma&s;ter Clothier, who mu&s;t know what kind of Wooll is proper for every Manufacture: From hence we find that in the Clothing Countries, they throw by a great quantity of their Wooll as not proper for their Work, and this is Carried out of tho&s;e Countries to the Wor&s;ted Works, and to the Comber; again in the Stuff-making Countries, the Wooll which is not proper for them is pick'd out and laid by, and carried out of their Countries to the Clothiers; and, the like of other Manufa|ctures.</P>
<P>This judgment perhaps may be carried over to <HI>France,</HI> by &s;uch Vagabond Bankrupt Clo|thiers
<PB N="39" REF="40">
and Combers as were not able to &s;how their Heads at Home, Nece&s;&s;ity may tempt &s;uch to go Abroad: As to the Carding, Combing, and Preparing the Wooll when Sorted, That is a Road which any one may Teach them, and which they perhaps may not want to Learn: So that this is not the Point.</P>
<P>The next Article is the Spinning, and give me leave to &s;ay THIS, as it is the E&s;&s;ential, &s;o it is the Inimitable part of our Manufacture, and the <HI>French</HI> are utterly Unable to do this, and we are Unable to Teach them; They are &s;o far from being able to Imitate the various &s;orts of Spinning which is now practiced in <HI>England,</HI> that really we cannot Imitate our &s;elves: There is &s;o much Evidence in this Truth, and it is &s;o well known, and &s;o prov'd by Experience, That I freely appeal to all the Manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> for the proof of it.</P>
<P>The Spinning, generally &s;peaking, is the Work of the Women and Children, it is Learn'd from Mother to Daughter, as Birds Learn to Sing, Cocks to Crow, and little Children to Speak, <HI>(viz.)</HI> by Immediate Imi|tation: The manner is carried from one to another by that aptne&s;s which is in the young of every Creature to follow the old, and be|comes a Natural Habit, like a Tone in the Speech, which is peculiar to this or that Coun|ty, which they, <HI>who u&s;e it,</HI> know not how to alter; and they, <HI>that do not,</HI> know not how to imitate.</P>
<P>Thus you may know the People who are Born and Bred in the &s;everal parts of this
<PB N="40" REF="41">
Kingdom by the Shibboleth of the Place they come from, they cannot Conceal it; nor can a Man Born in another part of the Country Mimick them &s;o but that he will ea&s;ily be known to be a Counterfeit: This is plain in the People of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk, Ea&s;t; Devon, Somer&s;et, Wilts</HI> and <HI>Dor&s;et, We&s;t; Lanca&s;hire North-We&s;t; York&s;hire, Durham</HI> and <HI>Northum|berland, North; Scotland, Wales,</HI> and &s;everal other parts.</P>
<P>In like manner every way the &s;ame in its kind, and introduc'd the &s;ame way, <HI>(viz.)</HI> by a meer habit, and that not to be alter'd by them&s;elves, or imitated by others, is the Manufacture of Spinning Naturalized to the People of the &s;everal Parts of <HI>England,</HI> ac|cording to the &s;everal Countries they have been taught to Work in: Nay, even in the &s;ame Countries the Spinning differs, as the &s;e|veral Manufactures which this or that part of the County are Employ'd in differs.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of this is E&s;&s;ential to the Manufacture, whence proceeds the variety of our &s;orts of Goods, which appears not at all according to the Nature of the Wooll, but according to the different Places where it is Wrought; the Rea&s;on of which is the Spin|ning, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>A Proof of this is ea&s;ily known by this Ex|periment; take the Spinning of one County, and carry it to be wrought into another Coun|ty, and for another kind of Goods than it u&s;es to be wrought in, the Defect &s;hall, pre&s;ently appear in the Goods, altho' for the Goods it was Spun for, it was the be&s;t of its Kind that could be.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">Nay, take the Spinning of one Town, and carry it to another Town where the &s;ame Kind of Goods are made, and it &s;hall Work into that &s;ame &s;ort, of the Kind, which were made in the Town from whence it came. How comes it to pa&s;s, That no Place in <HI>Eng|land</HI> can make the <HI>Bays</HI> but <HI>Colche&s;ter?</HI> the <HI>Says</HI> but <HI>Sudbury?</HI> the <HI>Serges</HI> but <HI>Devon&s;hire?</HI> the <HI>Ker&s;eys</HI> but <HI>Hallifax?</HI> the <HI>Fine Whites</HI> but <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire?</HI> the <HI>Tamies</HI> but <HI>Coventry?</HI> the <HI>Cantaloons</HI> but at <HI>Bri&s;tol?</HI></P>
<P>Nay, of the&s;e Goods, How come the &s;e|veral Species to differ &s;o from one another! Why cannot the Men of <HI>Bocking</HI> make as good <HI>Bays</HI> as at <HI>Colche&s;ter?</HI> Why are the <HI>Shaloons</HI> in <HI>Northampton&s;hire</HI> better than tho&s;e in the <HI>We&s;t?</HI> Why the <HI>Devon Ker&s;ies</HI> better than the <HI>York|&s;hire?</HI> and that the&s;e Towns, and Countries, tho' they have, or may have the &s;ame Wooll, are not able, with all their Skill, to Imitate or Come up to one another?</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t that it is all in the Spinning; whatever the Difference is it is hard to deter|mine; but that &s;uch a Difference is I affirm, and I appeal to all the Manufacturers in <HI>England</HI> for the truth of it: And this Difference runs thro' the whole Operation of the Manfacture that follows it, like an Error in the fir&s;t Concocti|on, which is never mended in the &s;econd; &s;o an Error, or a peculiar way in the fir&s;t Spin|ning, is never Corrected afterward; but as is the Yarn &s;uch is the Stuff, let it be of what Kind it will.</P>
<P>Now this, I &s;ay, is impo&s;&s;ible to be Carried into <HI>France:</HI> The People there Spin, and
<PB N="42" REF="43">
perhaps may Spin Finer than ours, and I be|lieve they do; but unle&s;s they Spin the &s;ame Kind of Threed for the &s;ame Kind of Manu|facture that we do, they can no more Imitate ours, than one of our Towns or Counties can Imitate another.</P>
<P>For Example, Take a Woman that has been bred to Spin for the making of <HI>Flannel,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e from <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and carry her into <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and let her &s;ee how they Spin as much as &s;he will, and try as much as &s;he can, &s;he &s;hall no more Spin good Yarn for making a Piece of <HI>Bays,</HI> or to <HI>Sudbury,</HI> &s;he &s;hall no more Spin for their Work, than the Spinners there can for her <HI>Flannel</HI>; &s;he can no more alter her Hand effectually, than &s;he can &s;hake off her <HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI> Dialect from her Tongue, and learn to Whine and Talk as they do in <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P>How many attempts of this kind have been made in <HI>England, (viz.)</HI> to Tran&s;plant the Manufacture of one County into another, and we have very rarely found it practicable; If then one County cannot Imitate another, if one Town cannot Imitate another, nay, in &s;ome Goods one Manufacturer cannot Imitate another, tho' they have all the &s;ame Materials too, How &s;hould another Nation Imitate us?</P>
<P>And what is the Rea&s;on that we find &s;uch Struggling, &s;uch Envying, &s;uch Quarrelling among our Manufacturers, like tittle Parties in the Trade, to get one another's Spinners away, and to get this or that Town Spinning away, but becau&s;e the Goodne&s;s of a Manu|facture always depends upon the Goodne&s;s of
<PB N="43" REF="44">
the Spinning: How comes this or that Clothiers Goods to be known at <HI>Blackwell-Hall,</HI> and to be enquired for by his Name, and by his Mark, and to Sell better than his Neighbours, and the like of other Goods, but that he has better Spinners than his Neighbours?</P>
<P>I might Dwell upon this, Prove and Explain it by many Arguments and Examples; but I believe every one who has any Experience of Trade will grant it.</P>
<P>If then, I &s;ay, we cannot Imitate one another in our Manufactures, where we have plenty of all Materials, Choice of the Wooll, and Experienc'd Workmen, only by Rea&s;on of the Difference and Difficulty of the Spin|ning; How &s;hall a Foreign Nation adapt their Spin|ning to our Manufacture? a Nation that have a great &s;carcity of Wooll, and mu&s;t mix &s;everal Kinds, and the Wooll of &s;everal Nations together, that have a &s;carcity of all other Materials, and above all mu&s;t take &s;uch Wild and Untaught Spinners as they can get?</P>
<P>Nor will it Argue in this Ca&s;e to &s;ay they can have Spinners from hence; for I affirm, the be&s;t Spinner in <HI>England</HI> cannot teach another to Spin as &s;he Spins, if ever the Learner had Spun any thing before; but if &s;he Teaches, it mu&s;t be young Children from Five year and upwards, or &s;ome that had never touch'd a Wheel.</P>
<P>When this is done, this Teaching Spinner can Teach only to Spin as &s;he Spun her &s;elf, be it for what&s;oever Species of Manufacture &s;he was brought up to; and I dare &s;ay, that the Nation can very rarely &s;hew a Spinner that can Spin very well a Yarn for more than one Kind of Manufacture; &s;o that by this Rule the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t get Spinners over to Teach their People, Di&s;tingui&s;ht by their Work for every kind of Manufacture we make.</P>
<P>This is a Rea&s;on why the <HI>French</HI> cannot come up to our Manufacture, and a Rea&s;on which, I flatter my &s;elf, cannot be an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>There is yet another thing which affects indeed &s;ome of our Manufactures only, but &s;o many of them, and that &s;o Con&s;iderable a part, (<HI>viz.</HI>) our Clothing, that I believe it renders it Inimitable in any other Part of the World, and this is the Water: I have not time to Enlarge upon this; but let the Men of <HI>Stroud water</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> be the Standard, and let us &s;ee any
<PB N="44" REF="45">
other Part of this Nation come up to them, and then we may &s;ugge&s;t that other Nations may al&s;o do it.</P>
<P>This would take up a Tract by it &s;elf to Explain, and to Examin the Rea&s;ons, why one Kind of Water &s;hould be better than another, for Dre&s;&s;ing, Milling, Wa&s;hing, as well as Dying; and why, tho' the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>French</HI> were able to fix brighter and better Colours than we can, yet the Wooll it &s;elf &s;hall not work &s;o kindly, the Nap of the Cloth ri&s;e &s;o well, nor the Shearer work &s;o clo&s;e, with the Dre&s;&s;ing in one Water, as it &s;hall in another; and for this Rea&s;on the Clo|thiers in &s;ome Parts Carry their Goods many Miles to the&s;e or tho&s;e Fulling Mills, when there are others nearer home.</P>
<P>I am &s;o near the Clo&s;e of this Tract that I cannot Enlarge; but I come to another Ca&s;e in our Manu|facture, wherein I find we are run down by a Vulgar Error, which however at this time is made mighty U&s;e of, and makes more Noi&s;e than is for our Reputation, e&s;pecially as it comes out of our own Mouths, and this is, That the <HI>French</HI> People Work Cheaper than we; nay, &s;o great is the a&s;&s;urance which our People &s;peak it with, that they are not &s;lack to &s;ay, that they can Work Cheaper by Four pence in a Shilling.</P>
<P>I am bold to &s;ay, &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e is enough to Con|vince any Man that under&s;tands Manufacturing, that the People who &s;peak it, either &s;ay it without know|ledge, or again&s;t knowledge, I am afraid it is the lat|ter.</P>
<P>Could the Poor in <HI>France</HI> Work Cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by a Groat in a Shilling, could the Spinner, the Weaver, the Carder, the Dre&s;&s;er, the Dyer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> perform all tho&s;e Works which are at the beginning of the Manufacture Four-pence in a Shilling Cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the Clothier that fini&s;hes it would be able to Sell it Eight pence in the Shilling Cheaper when it was fini&s;hed, for that Difference in the fir&s;t Work would double in the Price of the whole Cloth, and &s;o the Clothes which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could not Sell under Twelve Shillings <HI>per</HI> Yard at Market, the <HI>French</HI> would &s;ell at Four Shillings <HI>per</HI> Yard, and of Con&s;equence mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have long ago had all the Trade of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">As this, tho' but a &s;hort hint, is &s;ufficient to Ex|po&s;e the fal&s;hood of that Sugge&s;tion, &s;o I &s;hall lay one thing down as a certain Truth, which I know to be True of my own certain knowledg in many Ca|&s;es, and offer to prove by good Evidence in others, and I &s;hall leave it to farther Enlargement, if I am call'd to &s;peak to it again; The A&s;&s;ertion is this in &s;hort.</P>

<P>Let no Man &s;ugge&s;t that this cannot be made out, my Name is to this Book, I'll make it good, and at any rea&s;onable Hazard, I offer to prove it beyond the power of all the Cavils of the World: Take it in any, or all the Branches or Parts of the Woollen Ma|nufacture, I repeat it again in other Words, <HI>Set the goodne&s;s of the Performance, and the quantity of Work done, against the Wages,</HI> no Manufacturers in the World have their Work done Cheaper, or for for le&s;s Wages, than the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>I do not deny but in Diligence they may out-do us, I know the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poor are not &s;o forward to Work as the <HI>French,</HI> and perhaps when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have earn'd their Money hardly, they may &s;pend it lightlier than others, and be as poor as any of them.</P>
<P>I know that if you higher a <HI>Frenchman</HI> by the Day, he &s;hall come at le&s;s Wages.</P>
<P>I know if the <HI>French man</HI> Works for him&s;elf, he &s;hall &s;it to it more hours.</P>
<P>But then the <HI>Engli&s;h Day Man</HI> &s;hall do more Work in le&s;s time.</P>
<P>Or the <HI>Engli&s;h Day Man</HI> &s;hall make better Work.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Engli&s;h-man that Works for him&s;elf</HI> &s;hall perform as much in le&s;s time than the <HI>French-man,</HI> or make his Work De&s;erve more Wages.</P>
<P>I appeal to <HI>Spittle fields</HI> for the Truth of this in part, and even to the <HI>French</HI> Manufacturers there them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Had I room here, I &s;hould produce Experiments which I have made of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacturing, again&s;t <HI>French-men, Dutch-men, Scots-men,</HI> and others, I can prove in them all, that we Work much Cheap|er

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e are my Rea&s;ons why I think we are &s;ure to Gain by the <HI>French</HI> Trade, and I have &s;et them down with as much Clearne&s;s and Impartiallity as I can, and altho' the Treatment I receive from the World at this time, might be ju&s;tly allowed to move me, I have done it Calmly, and without any of the Rudene&s;s which the&s;e things are now debated with: Yet I cannot but &s;ay, that I am Injuriou&s;ly dealt with in the&s;e matters; every Man has a right to Think of the&s;e things, as his Rea&s;on, Experience and Judgment, Dictates; and I do not know any Law that forbids him making that Opinion publick.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t Complain of a Treatment which I Con|fe&s;s, I never &s;aw given to any Man but my &s;elf in this Nation: I am Treated by the Writers of the Town, as if it was Criminal in me to give my Opinion, becau&s;e it differs from theirs, and with the utmo&s;t Fury and Scurtillity; I am Treated as one that had lo&s;t my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty, and ought not to have free|dom of Speech allow'd me.</P>
<P>When other People Publi&s;h Pamphlets and Papers, which Argue again&s;t the&s;e Men, the&s;e An&s;wer them upon me, they adventure upon the meer Gue&s;s at Language, to call me the Author of any thing they do not like; tho' oftentimes I not only have not been the Author, but the fir&s;t knowledge I have had of the thing has been when I have &s;een my &s;elf In&s;olently Treated for Writing it.</P>
<P>I lay'd down the <HI>Review,</HI> becau&s;e my thoughts of things did not agree with the pre&s;ent Opinion of tho&s;e People for whom I had &s;o much Re&s;pect, that I was weary of differing with them; and in the la&s;t which I Publi&s;h'd, I hinted my De&s;ign, of Going Abroad, to be out of the reach of this Clamour, as &s;oon as pub|lick

<P>Whether I am Concern'd or no, I am dayly In&s;ulted and told, That I am not to be Treated with Decency, have the LYE given me in Print, by Men that do not think fit to let me know their Names, or to give me leave to ask them whether they will do it to my Face or no.</P>
<P>Per&s;ecution has been Condemned by all Sides as an Unchri&s;tian Practice; but if Cau&s;ele&s;s Slander be not a Cruelty wor&s;e than Death, and the Per&s;ecution of the Tongue be not the wor&s;t Kind of Per&s;ecution, let any Impartial Man judge.</P>
<P>Under all this Treatment I arm my &s;elf with Pa|tience, and De&s;ire to Return the&s;e Men no Evil for their Evil, I have Ruin'd my Family in the Service of the People who I find now &s;o Angry; and becau&s;e I could not De&s;ert them, Suffer'd all that the Rage of their Enemies could inflict; and I have liv'd to &s;ee tho&s;e very People Reproach me with that Suffering, and that Fidelity which they once acknowledg'd was a Service to them, is it &s;eems now my Infamy: Whether my Suffering merited their Thanks at that time I do not determine; but &s;ure it could not merit Thanks then, and their Reproach now: I appeal to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But be all the&s;e things as he &s;hall Direct who Go|verns the World, and God be prai&s;ed the&s;e Men are not to be my Judges at la&s;t, In the mean time, If I am not allow'd to give my Opinion in Things which no Law pre&s;cribes me in; Where then is Ju&s;tice! where Charity! where <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty! and how do the&s;e men &s;hew them&s;elves Tyrants even of the wor&s;t Kind! who would deprive a Man of his Liberty of Speech, becau&s;e he does not &s;ay what they approve of!</P>

the People who are at this time &s;o Warm, will in a few years be Convinc'd they are in the wrong; and be a&s;ham'd of tho&s;e Men who now endeavour to Enflame and Exa&s;perate us one again&s;t another; In the mean time I have here given my Rea&s;ons for my pre&s;ent Opinion relating to the Trade with <HI>France,</HI> which I have done rather as a Te&s;timony to future Times of the Foundation upon which my &s;aid Opinion is grounded, and to An&s;wer the Calumnies of tho&s;e People who Malign, and, without provocation, In&s;ult me, than from any pro&s;pect I have, that the &s;ounde&s;t Rea&s;oning will allay the Ferment which the Parties among us have unhappily put the Nation into.</P>
<P>I make no que&s;tion, in its proper time, to clear my &s;elf likewi&s;e from the Charge of having <HI>Chang'd Sides</HI> in OTHER matters, and to bring &s;ome People to ac|knowledge they do me Inju&s;tice in the Treatment they now give me; but the ferment is too great for Rea&s;on to take place, and I am content to &s;uffer the Injury, till it &s;hall plea&s;e Him that Guides the World to give me an Occa&s;ion to do my &s;elf Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But in Matters of Trade I think now is the time to &s;peak&mdash;A Trade with <HI>France,</HI> or no Trade with <HI>France,</HI> is now the que&s;tion: I have fir&s;t, to remove Scandal, proved to you what my Opinion was of the <HI>French</HI> Trade formerly, and what I &s;aid then about it; and now I have offer'd my pre&s;ent Opinion; if then what I &s;ay now of it, is no more than what I &s;aid formerly, it will hardly pa&s;s with any Rea&s;onable Man, That I am Chang'd, unle&s;s to Change, and to be the Same, be proved to be <HI>One part of Speech.</HI></P>
<P><HI>God deliver this Kingdom from the Dreadful Con&s;e|quences, which our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;ays, mu&s;t follow a Nation Divided again&s;t it &s;elf.</HI></P>
