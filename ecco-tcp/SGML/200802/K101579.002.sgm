<P>ADDRESSES of this Nature, which are too often ful&s;om Offer|ings to Vanity, or &s;ervile Applications to Power, when made to Per&s;ons of real Worth and Honour, are at the &s;ame Time Compliments artfully paid by Authors to them&s;elves..... While the Writer is de&s;canting upon the high Birth, inflexible Probity, patriot Spirit, humane Di&s;po|&s;ition, and the polite and literary Accom|pli&s;hments of his Patron, he in&s;inuates him&s;elf into the good Opinion of his Reader, as one favoured with the Ac|quaintance, and honoured by the Coun|tenance and Regard of a Per&s;on thus
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
amiable and illu&s;trious..... I &s;hall not pre|tend, my Lord, wholly to di&s;claim all Views of this Kind in the pre&s;ent Addre&s;s I have the Honour to make to you; and accordingly &s;hould take a particular Plea|&s;ure in enlarging upon the above, and other &s;hining Qualities in your Lord&s;hip's Character, did I not recollect that I have no Right to gratify the Public, or my&s;elf, at the Expence of your Lord&s;hip's private and per&s;onal Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Indeed it is my pre&s;ent Intere&s;t rather to engage your Lord&s;hip's favourable Opinion of the following Performances; and I know nothing more likly to do this than an A&s;&s;urance that I have aim'd by a &s;uitable Variety to adapt my&s;elf to al|mo&s;t all Sorts of Readers but immoral ones; that in &s;ome Pieces I have at|tempted to render the Graces of Numbers and the Embelli&s;hments of Poetry &s;ub|&s;ervient
<PB N="v" REF="4">
to the Intere&s;ts of Virtue, and Religion; that in others I have offered &s;uch critical Di&s;qui&s;itions as I hope will afford at lea&s;t a rational Entertainment to Men of Ta&s;te in polite Literature; and that in them all I have endeavoured occa|&s;ionally to expre&s;s my&s;elf with Dignity, Elegance, and Ea&s;e, which, by the way, are not more the Characteri&s;tics of good Writing, than of the Air, Manner, and Conver&s;ation of a certain Nobleman I have the Honour to be known to..... I look upon my&s;elf as apologizing to the Public when I am &s;peaking to your Lord&s;hip, and therefore have &s;aid thus much from a perfect Sen&s;e of the Con&s;equence it mu&s;t be to me as an Author to &s;e|cure your Lord&s;hip's Approbation of my Writings.</P>
<P>The Dedication of the&s;e to your Lord|&s;hip will after all, I fear, be thought a

trifling Proof of my Re&s;pect, and there|fore I de&s;ire it may however be con&s;ider'd as a &s;incere Te&s;timony of my Gratitude for the many Favours you have been plea&s;ed to confer on me; the mo&s;t mate|rial of which have been attended with this Circum&s;tance of Credit and Sati&s;|faction, that they are to be attributed to your Lord&s;hip's free and un&s;olicited Kindne&s;s, and Conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Obligations I am under to your Lord&s;hip are not of a Nature to be men|tioned here; but this Opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing a due Acknowledgment of them in the mo&s;t ample and public Manner, is with the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure taken by</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the Subject of the following Poem naturally led me to in|&s;cribe it to one of your Sex, I could not but hope, that the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the pre&s;ent Addre&s;s, from one who has not the Happine&s;s to be per&s;onally known to you, would be a &s;ufficient Apology for the Pre&s;umption of it. But tho' I may have the Misfortune to incur your Di&s;plea&s;ure, by offending your Hu|mility, I &s;hall, even under the Sen&s;e of your Di&s;approbation, have the Satisfaction to reflect, that I have been guilty of a very artful Piece of Impertinence; &s;ince, by placing your Name before my Per|formance, I have taken the mo&s;t effectual Method to recommend it to the Public.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="8">
Your Example, Madam, is a Reproach to the pre&s;ent indolent Generation; your Glory is not e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the per&s;o|nal Advantages you po&s;&s;e&s;s in &s;o eminent a Manner; which, great as they are, your good Sen&s;e a&s;&s;ures you, are, at the be&s;t, but the Subjects of pre&s;ent Admiration, and can never be the Ba&s;is of a la&s;ting Fame.</P>
<P>Your Handy-work, Madam, which has very ju&s;tly a Place among the Curi|o&s;ities of that famous Univer&s;ity, of which I have the Honour and Happine&s;s to be an incon&s;iderable Member, has rendered your Name immortal; and your nice Management of the Needle, that little, but important Implement of Oeconomy, has entitled you to the Reputation of the compleate&s;t Hou&s;ewife in <HI>Europe;</HI> a Cha|racter, to which all Virgins and Wives &s;hould a&s;pire.</P>
<P>You have taught us to acknowlege, that the mo&s;t minute Uten&s;il of Art may,
<PB N="v" REF="9">
by an ingenious Application of it, be made &s;ub&s;ervient, in the highe&s;t Degree, to the Honour of the Arti&s;t: A Pin, or a Needle, in your Hands, are In&s;tru|ments as effectual for that Purpo&s;e, as the Poet's Pen, or the Hero's Sword.</P>
<P>I am at pre&s;ent, Madam, in a very perplexed Situation of Mind; I have the Plea&s;ure to con&s;ider, that I am now upon a Subject that mu&s;t be agreeable to all my Readers, and at the &s;ame time have the Mortification to recollect, that 'tis di&s;ta&s;teful to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Though therefore all I could &s;ay in Commendation of your Merit, the World would think too little, yet, as what I have &s;aid you will think too much, I find my&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;iring your Pardon for this Liberty I have taken, and for another in the fourth Canto of this Poem, wherein I have pre|&s;umed to put a &s;hort Prediction, relating
<PB N="vi" REF="10">
to your amiable Character, into the Mouth of the Queen of Love. This I need not otherwi&s;e have intimated, &s;ince every one mu&s;t at fir&s;t Sight perceive, that this Prediction is properly applicable to none but your&s;elf.</P>
<P>After what I have &s;aid, Madam, may I venture to hope you have &s;ome Patience in Re&s;erve for the Poem? 'Twas de&s;ign'd for your Amu&s;ement, and, if that De&s;ign be an&s;wered, my Ambition is &s;atisfied: And indeed, to &s;ay Truth, I have &s;o thorough a Confidence in your good Na|ture, that I am per&s;uaded you will look with a favourable Eye upon the following Performance, though not in Ju&s;tice, yet in Pity to,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Have always con&s;idered a Preface as an Author's Apology for his Perform|ance; in which he has an undoubted Li|berty of &s;aying as much as he plea&s;es in Favour of him&s;elf: As I cannot there|fore but be apprehen&s;ive of the Succe&s;s of the following Piece, I mu&s;t beg Leave to take this comfortable Privilege, as well as my Poetical Brethren. The principal Circum&s;tances I have to urge in my own Behalf, are, that this Poem is the fir&s;t Production of a young and unexperienced Author (excepting a few trifling Pieces in the <HI>Magazines);</HI> and that I am &s;o far from bidding Defiance to the Critics, that I addre&s;s my&s;elf to them in the mode&s;t and

<P>As to the Poem it&s;elf, I have endea|voured, in &s;ome particular Pa&s;&s;ages, to imitate the Manner of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Rape of the Lock,</HI> upon a Pre&s;umption, that &s;uch Imitation would be deemed meritori|ous in &s;o young a Writer as my&s;elf. I ought likewi&s;e to acknowlege, that I had in View the Epi&s;ode of the <HI>Patten</HI> in Mr. <HI>Gay</HI>'s <HI>Trivia.</HI> How far I have reached the Spirit required in this Kind of Poetry, mu&s;t be left to the Reader, to who&s;e Can|dour and Judgment I &s;ubmit the follow|ing Poem.</P>

<HEAD>THE THIMBLE. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE THIMBLE, &amp;c.] The Author, by this &s;imple Title of his Poem, has very judiciou&s;ly e&s;caped the Cen&s;ure, which mo&s;t modern Poets have incured, by their Af|fectation of Antiquity in their Title-Pages. This excellent Poem might, with as much Propriety, have been called <HI>The Thimblead,</HI> or <HI>The Thimbleiad,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s was intituled <HI>The Dunciad&punc;</HI> But &s;uch Imitation appeared trifling and obvious to our Author, and, at be&s;t, had been <HI>mal-apropos,</HI> and nothing to the <HI>Point</HI>&mdash;of a <HI>Needle.</HI>&mdash;I wi&s;h, however, I could as well account for his calling it an <HI>Heroi-comical</HI> Poem, rather than an <HI>Heroic</HI> one; which I take it indi&s;putably to be. It has its Action, its Fable, its Manners, its Sentiment, and its Diction, which are the con&s;tituent Parts of the <HI>Epic</HI> Poem. And though, in re&s;pect of all the&s;e, it may, in &s;ome In&s;tances, differ from the Plan of the Antients, and the Doc|trine of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> I cannot think it thereby degraded into a different and lower Species of Poetry. Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> him&s;elf allows, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Rules for <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry (which he has drawn from his Reflections upon <HI>Homer)</HI> cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to quadrate exactly with the <HI>Heroic</HI> Poems, which have been, or may be, made &s;ince his Time. <HI>(See</HI> Spec. N^o. 273.) For this Rea&s;on, it would be ridiculous to object to the Action of this Poem, its Deficiency in Point of Greatne&s;s or Importance&mdash;a &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary Qualification in the Action of the <HI>Epopee;</HI> and indeed, admitting it &s;o to be, the Objection is founded in fal&s;e and improper Ideas of <HI>Greatne&s;s and Importance;</HI> and in the wrong Impre&s;&s;ions made upon Minds of a romantic Turn by the Exploits of antient Heroes, and the Manners and Cu&s;toms of barbarous and uncivilized Nations. Becau&s;e what was a proper Subject for <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry, in the Days of <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> would be &s;hocking and ab&s;urd in &s;o <HI>refined and delicate an Age as this.</HI> The Action of this Poem is abundantly important for the&s;e Times of <HI>genteel Indolence, and &s;uperb Tranquility;</HI> and the Author, all the while, in&s;tead of dropping his Acquaintance with the Antients, art|fully makes u&s;e of it upon many Occa&s;ions, without a Po&s;&s;ibility of giving Offence to any <HI>fine Lady or Gentleman,</HI> by &s;uch <HI>robu&s;t and inde|licate</HI> Imagery, as that with which the old <HI>Epic</HI> abounds.&mdash;We &s;hall occa&s;ionally &s;hew, in the Cour&s;e of our Critici&s;ms, that he rarely in any re&s;pect deviates from the antient Plan without improving it.&mdash;What has been already advanced will ju&s;tify likewi&s;e his making a Lady the principal per&s;onage in the Poem.&mdash;If female Characters are re&s;pectable, even in the Writings of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> Decency, &s;ure, Propriety, and Complai&s;ance, required they &s;hould have the fir&s;t Place in the Poem before us.&mdash;Thus much we thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e in general; we &s;hall proceed to farther Remarks, as they are &s;ugge&s;ted by the Poem it&s;elf.</NOTE></HEAD>

<HEAD>TO Sir JOHN PHILIPPS, Bar^t.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am happy in your Permi&s;&s;ion to &s;helter under your Name a Performance which &s;tands in much Need of your Favour and Pro|tection, e&s;pecially as it comes into the World with &s;ome Di&s;advantage; yet I hope you will do me the Ju&s;tice to believe me actuated by a nobler Principle than that of a Selfi&s;hne&s;s common to all Authors, in my Choice of a Patron upon the pre|&s;ent Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>For, Sir, the following Sheets are with a par|ticular Propriety yours, whether you are con&s;idered as a Per&s;on &s;incerely attached to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> or affectionately intere&s;ting your&s;elf in the Welfare of <HI>Pembroke-College;</HI> to the Regard and be&s;t Wi&s;hes of which Society you have a double Claim, both as an Ornament, and a Benefactor.</P>
<P>The common Topics of Panegyric are obvious; and I have here a fair and agreeable Opportunity of taking Notice of tho&s;e many amiable Qualities, which adorn you in public and private Life, and for which you are &s;o ju&s;tly beloved and e&s;teemed: But my Inclination is corrected by a &s;ea&s;onable Thought, that mo&s;t Writers of the pre&s;ent Age
<PB REF="64">
have, in this Re&s;pect, a con&s;iderable Advantage over me, as it is much more ea&s;y to make a Cha|racter, than to de&s;cribe one.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it would be needle&s;s to enter into a Detail of tho&s;e Prai&s;es, which are already in the Mouth of every Well-wi&s;her to his Country: And therefore I will only indulge the Impul&s;e of Gra|titude, which points to that Part of your Cha|racter, which more immediately affects me; your Good-nature and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, to which I am indebted for the Honour of your Acquaintance and Friend&s;hip, and for your favourable Accept|ance of the following Poem.</P>
<P>Give me Leave to a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that I am principally anxious for the Reputation of this Tragedy, from an earne&s;t De&s;ire of tran&s;mitting to Po&s;terity a Monument of the Regard and Ve|neration I have for the Per&s;on and Character of Sir JOHN PHILIPPS. I am,</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t <HI>material</HI> Objection to this Tragedy, made by Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> was, that it is rather a <HI>Poem,</HI> than a <HI>Play.</HI>&mdash;A <HI>con&s;olatory</HI> Octjection at lea&s;t! as it is founded only in the Author's acknow|leged Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>mechanical</HI> Laws of the <HI>Drama.</HI> But however rea&s;onable the Objection might be to the <HI>Repre&s;entation</HI> of this Tragedy upon the <HI>Stage,</HI> it was by no Means thought a &s;ufficient one to its <HI>original</HI> Publication; nor con&s;equently, 'tis pre|&s;umed, will be e&s;teemed &s;uch again&s;t its having a Place in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Collection.&mdash;Tho&s;e who are offended at the Liberties taken in it, may, if they plea&s;e, call it an <HI>Hi&s;torical Play,</HI> and then all Ex|ceptions of this Nature vani&s;h of Cour&s;e.&mdash;After all, the Objection will perhaps have <HI>le&s;s</HI> Weight with the candid and judicious Reader, when he has fa|voured with his Peru&s;al the <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> on the <HI>Antient and Modern Drama;</HI> though he is not to look upon that <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> as written with a View to the Defence of <HI>this particular</HI> Play, or to con&s;ider <HI>this Adverti&s;e|ment</HI> as any Thing like a Declaration of the <HI>Au|thor's Right</HI> of Exemption from the <HI>common Rules of the Drama,</HI> by Virtue of any &s;uperiour <HI>Qualifications</HI> in <HI>Him&s;elf.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Tragedy of <HI>Cymbeline</HI> is, in the whole oeconomy of it, one of the mo&s;t ir|regular productions of <HI>Shake&s;peare.</HI> Its defects however, or rather its &s;uperfluities, are more than equalled by beauties, and excellencies of various kinds. There is at the &s;ame time &s;omething &s;o plea&s;ingly romantic, and likewi&s;e truly <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> in the &s;ubject of it, that, I flatter my&s;elf, an attempt to reduce it, as near as po&s;&s;ible, to the regular &s;tan|dard of the <HI>drama,</HI> will be favourably received by all, who are admirers of <HI>novelty,</HI> when <HI>pro|priety</HI> is its foundation. I have accordingly en|deavoured to new-con&s;truct this Tragedy, almo&s;t upon the plan of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> him&s;elf, in re&s;pect of the <HI>unity</HI> of <HI>Time;</HI> with &s;o thorough a venera|tion however for the great <HI>Father</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;tage, that, even while I have pre&s;umed to regu|late and modernize his de&s;ign, I have thought it an honour to tread in his &s;teps, and to imitate his Stile, with the humility and reverence of a <HI>Son.</HI> With this view, I have retained in <HI>many</HI> places the very language of the original author, and in
<PB N="vi" REF="230">
<HI>all</HI> others endeavoured to &s;upply it with a diction &s;imilar thereunto; &s;o that, as an unknown friend of mine has ob&s;erved, the pre&s;ent attempt is in|tirely <HI>new,</HI> whether it be con&s;idered as an <HI>alter|ation from,</HI> or an <HI>imitation of Shake&s;peare.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;The <HI>difficulty</HI> of &s;uch an attempt, as <HI>ra|tional</HI> as it may be, has a kind of <HI>claim,</HI> I pre|&s;ume, to the <HI>indulgence</HI> of the public; e&s;pe|cially as it has been attended likewi&s;e with <HI>di&s;|advantages.</HI>&mdash;For I found my&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated by my plan to <HI>drop &s;ome</HI> characters, to <HI>contract others,</HI> and to omit <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;cenes and incidents of an intere&s;ting nature;&mdash;or rather to bring the &s;ub&s;tance and purport of them within the com|pa&s;s of a few &s;hort narrations.&mdash;A lo&s;s irrepar|able this, but that conveniencies are likewi&s;e to be thrown into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale; for as, I hope, I have not <HI>injured</HI> any characters by <HI>contracting</HI> them, but have left them to <HI>all intents,</HI> and in point of <HI>importance</HI> the <HI>&s;ame;</HI> &s;o I have had an opportunity of <HI>enlarging</HI> and <HI>improving &s;ome</HI> of the original parts, (tho&s;e particularly of <HI>Palador,</HI> and <HI>Philario,</HI> the <HI>Pi&s;anio of Shake&s;peare)</HI> and, by varying certain incidents and circum&s;tances, of giving a <HI>new ca&s;t</HI> to the whole <HI>drama.</HI>&mdash;After all, I am very far from meaning to detract from the merit of <HI>Shake&s;peare;</HI> or&punc; from in&s;inuating that the plays of &s;o exalted a genius <HI>require</HI> &s;uch
<PB N="vii" REF="231">
new-modelling as the pre&s;ent, in order to the rendering them u&s;eful or entertaining.&mdash;I have ventured publicly to defend this great <HI>dramatic</HI> Poet in the liberties he has taken; but &s;till <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> him&s;elf needs not be <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> to <HI>wear</HI> a <HI>modern dre&s;s,</HI> provided it can be made tolerably to <HI>fit</HI> him.</P>
<P>The only que&s;tion then will be, whether the pre&s;ent <HI>alteration</HI> be a judicious one?&mdash;And this with all due deference is left to the candour and ju&s;tice of the public.</P>
<P>It will be proper to acquaint the reader, that, this play, was recommended &s;ome time &s;ince by a per&s;on of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, to the manager of the other theatre; who declared, that he had the very &s;ame altered play in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that it was de&s;igned for repre&s;entation on his &s;tage. Our <HI>Cymbeline</HI> therefore was obliged to take up his head quarters at <HI>Covent-Garden;</HI> where he has contended not only with the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> difficulties, but al&s;o with <HI>others</HI> of an <HI>extraor|dinary</HI> nature&mdash;Mrs. <HI>Bellamy</HI>'s declining the part of <HI>Imogen</HI> has done the play incredible prejudice; and convinces me of the vanity of &s;triving again&s;t the &s;tream of popularity in ge|neral, or the weight of particular di&s;advantages.&mdash;However, I am under obligations to <HI>many</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="232">
of the performers, for their be&s;t endeavours to do ju&s;tice to my piece, and for their zeal for its &s;ucce&s;s. To <HI>&s;ome</HI> I am indebted for real &s;ervice, who&s;e names, as compari&s;ons are invidious, I leave it to the judgment of the reader to &s;upply.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I am at a lo&s;s to ballance the account between my&s;elf and my fortune, in this whim&s;ical &s;ituation. The kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and, I hope, not extremely partial approbation of <HI>&s;ome,</HI> adds as much to my <HI>credit</HI> and <HI>&s;atisfac|tion,</HI> as the <HI>delicacy,</HI> or <HI>ill-nature,</HI> &amp;c. of <HI>others,</HI> has deducted from my <HI>advantages.</HI>&mdash;To my <HI>friends,</HI> I return my &s;incere acknowledg|ments, and be&s;t wi&s;hes; to my <HI>enemies,</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, 'till they are <HI>candid,</HI> and <HI>&s;agacious</HI> enough to &s;peak more <HI>plainly</HI> than they have hi|therto done,&mdash;and more <HI>to the purpo&s;e.</HI></P>

<L>BRITONS, the daring Author of to-night,</L>
<L>Attempts in Shake&s;pear's manly &s;tile to write;</L>

<L>This imitation, that original.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For other points, our new advent'rer tries</L>
<L>The bard's luxuriant plan to modernize;</L>
<L>And, by the rules of antient art, refine</L>
<L>The &s;ame eventful, plea&s;ing, bold de&s;ign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our &s;cenes awake not now the am'rous flame,</L>
<L>Nor teach &s;oft &s;wains to woo the tender dame;</L>
<L>Content, for bright example's &s;ake, to &s;hew</L>
<L>A wife di&s;tre&s;s'd, and innocence in woe.&mdash;</L>
<L>For what remains, the poet bids you &s;ee,</L>
<L>From an old tale, what Britons ought to be;</L>
<L>And in the&s;e re&s;tle&s;s days of war's alarms,</L>
<L>Not melts the &s;oul to love, but fires the blood to arms.</L>

<L>Oh! then with candour and good will attend,</L>
<L>Applaud the author in the cordial friend:</L>

<LG>
<L>WELL, Sirs&mdash;the bus'ne&s;s of the day is o'er,</L>
<L>And I'm a prince&s;s, and a wife no more&mdash;</L>
<L>This bard of our's, with Shake&s;pear in his head,</L>
<L>May be well-taught, but &s;urely is ill-bred.</L>
<L>Spou&s;e gone, coa&s;t clear, wife hand&s;ome, and what not,</L>

<L>What madne&s;s equals true poetic rage?</L>
<L>Fine &s;tuff! a lady in a hermitage!</L>
<L>A pretty man&s;ion for the blooming fair&mdash;</L>
<L>No tea, no &s;candal,&mdash;no intriguing there.&mdash;</L>

&mdash;The gay beau-monde &s;uch hideous &s;cenes mu&s;t damn&mdash;</L>
<L>What! nothing modi&s;h, but one cordial dram!</L>
<L>&mdash;Yet after all, the poet bids me &s;ay,</L>
<L>For your own credit's &s;ake approve the play;</L>
<L>You can't for &s;hame condemn old Briti&s;h wit,</L>
<L>(I hope there are no Frenchmen in the pit)</L>
<L>Or &s;light a timely tale, that well di&s;covers,</L>
<L>The brave&s;t &s;oldiers are the true&s;t lovers.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such Leonatus was, in our romance,</L>
<L>A gallant courtier, tho' he cou'd not dance;</L>
<L>Say, wou'd you gain, like him, the fair one's charms,</L>
<L>Fir&s;t try your might in hardy deeds of arms;</L>
<L>Your muffs, your coffee, and down-beds fore-go,</L>
<L>Follow the mighty Pru&s;&s;ia thro' the &s;now;</L>
<L>At length bring home the honourable &s;car,</L>
<L>And love's &s;weet balm &s;hall heal the wounds of war.</L>

<L>For me, what various thoughts my mind perplex?</L>
<L>Is't better I re&s;ume my feeble &s;ex,</L>

<L>The court's divided, and the gentle beaux,</L>
<L>Cry&mdash;no di&s;gui&s;es&mdash;give the girl her cloaths.</L>
<L>The ladies &s;ay, to-night's example teaches,</L>

<P>AN ESSAY ON THE ANTIENT and MODERN DRAMA, OCCASIONED BY M^R^. MASON's ELFRIDA, And the LETTERS Prefixed to it.</P>

<PB REF="364">
<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE ANTIENT and MODERN DRAMA.</HEAD>
<P>I Have often read with much Plea&s;ure the in|genious Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Dramatic Poem,</HI> entitled <HI>Elfrida,</HI> together with the preparatory <HI>Letters</HI> with which that Gentleman introduces it to the Public. This Piece is profe&s;&s;edly written on the Model of the antient <HI>Greek Tragedy;</HI> and though I flatter my&s;elf, the Objections I have to the Prin|ciples laid down in tho&s;e <HI>Letters</HI> are not removed by this much-labour'd Attempt, yet I will readily own the De&s;ign is executed with a &s;kilful hand, and in &s;ome re&s;pects de&s;erves the Attention of the pre&s;ent Writers of the <HI>Engli&s;h Drama.</HI> I did not therefore undertake this Argument with any Inclination to differ from a Per&s;on of his known
<PB N="262" REF="365">
Ta&s;te, and greatly admired Abilities, but purely in Vindication of the Theory I have had the Ho|nour to deliver in a Cour&s;e of <HI>Lectures</HI> to the UNIVERSITY of OXFORD, in which, with a par|ticular View to the Ju&s;tification of <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> I have ventured to advance and defend a Sy&s;tem in &s;ome material Points incon&s;i&s;tent with that un|der pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration. Neither am I unaware of the great Di&s;advantage I have to contend again&s;t, when I oppo&s;e a celebrated Writer, who&s;e Sentiments are countenanc'd by the Prac|ti&s;e of the antient Poets, and who&s;e Pen is drawn under the Banner of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> him&s;elf: A Di&s;ad|vantage, which the U&s;age of later Writers, and the almo&s;t concurrent Voice of modern Critici&s;m <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By modern Critici&s;m I mean that Plan upon which the <HI>Engli&s;h Drama</HI> had been form'd for a Cour&s;e of many Gene|rations, and which Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on,</HI> and other Critics and Poets have in our Days attempted, both by Precept and Example, to &s;uper&s;ede and explode in favour of the Antient Sy&s;tem.</NOTE>perhaps will be thought little enough to coun|terbalance. However, as in Matters of Ta&s;te we ought only, I apprehend, to appeal to the genuine Dictates of Good-&s;en&s;e, Rea&s;on and Nature (which an implicit Veneration for any Name Antient or Modern may po&s;&s;ibly prevent our regarding) &s;o, if Prejudices on both Sides were removed, it would probably appear that the Victory is rather to be divided, than determined, and that with|out depreciating the real Merit and Excellency
<PB N="263" REF="366">
of the antient Poets, we may yet &s;afely defend the Principles on which the Moderns reject their Writings as the ab&s;olute and everla&s;ting Standard of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Compo&s;ition: I mean principally with regard to the three great Unities of Action, Time, and Place.&mdash;What I have to &s;ay therefore upon the&s;e Subjects I &s;ubmit without farther Apo|logy to the Judgment of the intelligent and im|partial Reader, adverti&s;ing him only in this Place, that he is not to expect a Methodical Treati&s;e of elaborate Critici&s;m, but only a Train of occa&s;ional Thoughts and Reflections, as they occur'd to me upon the Peru&s;al of the Poem of <HI>Elfrida,</HI> and the <HI>Letters</HI> prefix'd to it.</P>
<Q>Had I intended, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> in his fir&s;t Letter, (for I chu&s;e to repeat his own Words to prevent Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion) to give an exact Copy of the antient <HI>Drama,</HI> your objections to the pre&s;ent Poem would be unan&s;werable. But my de&s;ign was much le&s;s confin'd. I meant only to pur&s;ue the antient Method &s;o far as is probable a Greek Poet, were he alive, would now do, in order to adapt him&s;elf to the Genius of our Times, and the Character of our Tragedy. According to this Notion, every Thing was to be allow'd to the pre&s;ent Ta&s;te, which Nature and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly di&s;pen&s;e with; and nothing of Intrigue or refinement was to be ad|mitted, at which antient Judgment could rea|&s;onably
<PB N="264" REF="367">
take Offence. Good Sen&s;e, as well as Antiquity, pre&s;cribed an adherence to the three great Unities; the&s;e therefore were &s;trictly ob|&s;erved.</Q>
<P>'Tis evident from this Pa&s;&s;age, the ingenious Author would have us con&s;ider the Laws of <HI>Ari|&s;totle,</HI> and the Practice of Antiquity relating to the great Unities, as manife&s;tly founded in the fir&s;t Principles of Nature and Good Sen&s;e; and ac|cordingly in order to adapt him&s;elf to the pre&s;ent Ta&s;te no farther than might be ju&s;tly allowable, we find him deviating from the Rules and Prac|tice of Antiquity but in two In&s;tances; Fir&s;t in the Choice of a Story, in which Love is the pre|dominant Pa&s;&s;ion, and Secondly, in which Cha|racters are repre&s;ented as nearly approaching to private ones as <HI>Tragic</HI> Dignity would permit. Upon our Author's <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> indeed the&s;e are perhaps almo&s;t the only Deviations that could be allow'd him; and the Point mu&s;t at once be given up, if the Theory be true which is here in &s;o po&s;itive a manner advanc'd. For Satisfaction there|fore in this Matter it may be u&s;eful in the fir&s;t Place to ob&s;erve, that the Action of the antient <HI>Drama,</HI> when brought to the Perfection in which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> found it, was &s;o &s;trictly One, and the Fable &s;o ab&s;olutely Simple, and almo&s;t totally ab|horrent from Incident, at lea&s;t from what Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> calls Contrivance, Refinement and Intrigue,
<PB N="265" REF="368">
that the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Drama</HI> did not &s;o properly require, as &s;uppo&s;e and imply a corre|&s;pondent Unity of Time and Place. Nay, u&s;ually we find among the antient <HI>Greek</HI> Poets the en|tire Action of the <HI>Drama</HI> was brought within the Compa&s;s of the Repre&s;entation it&s;elf. And in|deed if <HI>exact</HI> Nature and <HI>&s;trict</HI> Propriety are in|di&s;pen&s;ably to be the Objects of the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Poet's Attention upon all Occa&s;ions, this mu&s;t be allow'd to be the mo&s;t perfect Model of <HI>Tragedy;</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> him&s;elf &s;eems to have indulg'd the <HI>Tragic</HI> Mu&s;e too far, when in con|formity with the &s;ometime Practice of the <HI>Greek Poets,</HI> He has pre&s;crib'd a Day as the due and regular Boundary of all <HI>Dramatic</HI> Action. For certainly a Day cannot really be compriz'd within the Space of five Hours any more than a Year, or any preci&s;e Duration what&s;oever. The Truth is, Poetry was the Mother of Critici&s;m, not Cri|tici&s;m of Poetry, and accordingly this great Phi|lo&s;opher form'd his &s;imple Notions and Rules upon the be&s;t Plan of the <HI>Drama</HI> then extant; but I cannot think it will by any Means follow that tho&s;e Rules are in all Points of perpetual and nece&s;&s;ary Obligation: For why was it not in it|&s;elf as agreeable to Nature and Rea&s;on for the Poets to admit Contrivance and Policy, De&s;ign and Intrigue into the Con&s;titution of the Fable, as it could po&s;&s;ibly be to confine them&s;elves to the
<PB N="266" REF="369">
Repre&s;entation of the mo&s;t &s;imple and uniform Action; e&s;pecially as they hereby improv'd, and heighten'd that Perplexity, and Di&s;tre&s;s, which are the great Sources of Delight in Dramatic En|tertainment? I &s;ay this Latitude of De&s;ign is not in it&s;elf unrea&s;onable or unnatural, becau&s;e 'tis not to be di&s;&s;embled that the Liberty contended for would indeed be, as it has been, in the Hands of the un&s;kilful and injudicious, an Inlet to Con|fu&s;ion and Ab&s;urdity. However it will not &s;urely be denied that there is in Fact a very material Difference between Incidents, and the Variety of De&s;igns and Contrivances that occa&s;ion them, and mere Bu&s;tle and <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> in his contempt of which Word Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> &s;eems willing to involve the whole Sy&s;tem of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Intrigue. The general Theory I would therefore advance is this, (for I would not be under&s;tood to a&s;&s;ert it admits of no Exception) that it is not barely the Privi|lege, but often even the Duty of the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Poet to adapt him&s;elf to the Vici&s;&s;itudes of Public Ta&s;te, and to repre&s;ent human Life, and human Actions as he finds them; and if in Pur&s;uance of this De&s;ign, he may think it expedient to make Choice of a Subject of &s;uch a complicated Nature as cannot with Ea&s;e and Con&s;i&s;tency be di&s;patch'd within the <HI>&s;tatutable</HI> Limits of Time, and Place, I cannot &s;ee why we may not indulge him with a proportionable Allowance of each, in order to
<PB N="267" REF="370">
prevent infinitely greater Ab&s;urdities and Incon|&s;i&s;tencies than that Allowance can po&s;&s;ibly pro|duce, that is, tho&s;e confus'd and precipitate Action. And all this while the Exten&s;ivene&s;s of the De&s;ign, provided it be executed with Judg|ment in other Re&s;pects, de&s;erves rather to be look'd upon as an Excellence and an Improve|ment upon the old Model, than to be placed to the Account either of the Ignorance or the Inat|tention of the Writer; of which more hereafter.</P>
<Q>There is that Sovereign Quality in Poetry (to u&s;e the Words of the ingenious Author of the <HI>Notes on the Epi&s;tle to Augu&s;tus)</HI> which the Poet <HI>(Horace)</HI> in the following pa&s;&s;age,
<Q><LG>
<L>Ille per exten&s;um funem mihi po&s;&s;e videtur</L>
<L>Ire Poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,</L>
<L>Irritat, mulcet, fal&s;is terroribus implet,</L>
<L>Ut Magnus; et modo me Thebis, modo ponit Athenis:</L>
</LG></Q>
con&s;iders as a kind of <HI>magic virtue,</HI> which tran&s;ports the Spectator into all Places, and makes him, occa&s;ionally, a&s;&s;ume all Per&s;ons. The Re&s;emblance holds al&s;o in this, that it's effects are in&s;tantaneous and irre&s;i&s;tible. <HI>Rules, Art, Decorum,</HI> all fall before it. It goes di|rectly to the Heart, and gains all purpo&s;es at once. Hence it is, that &s;peaking of a real Genius, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this commanding Power, <HI>Horace</HI> in the Lines above quoted, <HI>Ille per exten&s;um,</HI> &amp;c. pronounces him emphatically
<PB N="268" REF="371">
<HI>The Poet;</HI> it being more e&s;pecially this Pro|perty, which, of it&s;elf, di&s;covers the <HI>true Dramati&s;t,</HI> and &s;ecures the &s;ucce&s;s of his per|formance, not only without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Art,</HI> but in direct Oppo&s;ition to it's cleare&s;t Dictates.</Q>
<P>This Pa&s;&s;age which I have quoted <HI>verbatim</HI> (abating a few Expre&s;&s;ions in it) exactly coincides with my &s;entiment upon this Head; and the Ap|plication which the Author makes of it in Favour of <HI>Corneille,</HI> may, I pre&s;ume, be made with equal Propriety at lea&s;t in Behalf of our <HI>Shake&s;peare.</HI>&mdash;I am &s;en&s;ible all this while that this great Prince and Father of the Engli&s;h <HI>Stage</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> to have &s;hewn a total Di&s;regard of all the Rules of the <HI>Drama,</HI> in Compliance merely with the Ta&s;te of the Times. I mu&s;t own, I could have been glad to have &s;een fewer Things <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> upon this Subject. I will take the Liberty like|wi&s;e to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> that this great Poet &s;aw no legal or nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;traint upon the Force and Impetuo|&s;ity of his Genius with Regard to the Unities of Action, Time and Place; that he con&s;idered the Laws relating to them as merely local and tem|porary, well adapted indeed to the &s;imple Genius of antient <HI>Tragedy,</HI> but in them&s;elves and the Rea&s;on of Things di&s;pen&s;able upon the Suppo&s;ition of a <HI>Dramatic</HI> Plan of a more exten&s;ive and com|plicated Nature. His Opinion might be (like the
<PB N="269" REF="372">
current one mentioned in Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI>'s &s;econd <HI>Letter)</HI> that <Q>the &s;trict Adherence to the Unities re&s;trains the Genius of the Poet; by the Simpli|city of it's Conduct dimini&s;hes the Pathos of the Fable; and by the Admi&s;&s;ion of a continued Chorus prevents that agreeable Embarra&s;s, which awakens our Attention, and intere&s;ts our Pa&s;&s;ions.</Q>&mdash;However, that the Nature of <HI>Dra|matic</HI> Poetry will not only admit of a more ex|ten&s;ive Model than the <HI>Tragedies</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets furni&s;h us with, but is al&s;o improveable by the &s;ame, if it cannot be proved, may at lea&s;t I think be inferr'd even from the Doctrine of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> him&s;elf. This great Critic, it is very well known, calls the <HI>Fable</HI> the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Tragedy;</HI> with a manife&s;t Eye to which Expre&s;&s;ion, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> ob&s;erves that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> places the <HI>Fable</HI> fir&s;t, <Q>non quoad <HI>Dignitatem,</HI> &s;ed quoad <HI>Funda|mentum.</HI></Q> And indeed we need only refer the Reader to the &s;imple Arguments of <HI>Ae&s;chylus,</HI> and even of <HI>Euripides</HI> and <HI>Sophocles</HI> for the mo&s;t part too, to convince him that the <HI>Fable</HI> upon the antient Plan of the <HI>Drama</HI> cannot properly be &s;aid to be the <HI>Soul</HI> of the Poem in any other Sen&s;e, than as it is the <HI>Subject</HI> of it. Nay, this is in a great Mea&s;ure the Ca&s;e even of tho&s;e antient <HI>Tra|gedies</HI> which are of the <HI>implex</HI> Kind, and, as &s;uch, e&s;teemed mo&s;t excellent by our Philo&s;opher. One main Argument u&s;ed by him for the Priority
<PB N="270" REF="373">
of the <HI>Fable</HI> in the con&s;tituent Parts of <HI>Tragedy</HI> is taken from the Con&s;ideration of the &s;ud|den <HI>Revolutions</HI> and <HI>Di&s;coveries,</HI> (the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ari&s;t. Poet. Chap. 6.</NOTE><GAP DESC="foreign"> as he calls them) which di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>Tragedies</HI> we are &s;peaking of from tho&s;e of the &s;imple&s;t Kind. The&s;e are the means, &s;ays he, by which <HI>Tragedy</HI> more par|ticularly captivates and engages (<GAP DESC="foreign">) the Mind and Affections.</P>
<P>Now if this Doctrine be applied to the modern <HI>Drama,</HI> it &s;eems to me not only an Apology for, but in Effect a Recommendation of the Incidents and Revolutions, which are infinitely more nu|merous upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Stage than they were upon that of <HI>Athens,</HI> and are &s;o offen&s;ive to &s;queami&s;h Judgments; unle&s;s it can be proved that the&s;e under the Direction of a good Judgment do not contribute to, or rather con&s;titute that Va|riety which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> plainly refers to in the Pa&s;|&s;age quoted; or that &s;uch Variety in modern Plays has not a proportionable Influence on the Pa&s;&s;ions, upon which, as Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> rightly has ob&s;erved, it is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Tragic</HI> Mu&s;e "directly to &s;trike."&mdash;If therefore the <HI>Fable</HI> be the <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, there is more <HI>Soul</HI> in a good modern <HI>Tragedy,</HI> than in the be&s;t antient one; and that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> might very properly, and therefore gravely call &s;ecret
<PB N="271" REF="374">
Intrigues the <HI>Beauties of our modern Stage.</HI> Indeed that great Man in &s;ome occa&s;ional Re|marks he made on Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s Reflections on the <HI>Tragedies</HI> of <HI>Fletcher,</HI> &amp;c. makes no &s;cruple to give the Preference to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets before the <HI>Antients</HI> under this very Article of Enquiry: <Q>Next &s;hew, &s;ays he, in what An|tient <HI>Tragedy</HI> was deficient; for Example, in the Narrowne&s;s of it's Plots, and Fewne&s;s of Per&s;ons, and try whether that be not a Fault in the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets; and whether their Excel|lency was &s;o great, when the Variety was vi|&s;ibly &s;o little; or whether what they did was not very ea&s;y to be done.</Q></P>
<P>In Oppo&s;ition to this the following Words of the ingenious Author of the <HI>Notes</HI> &amp;c. already referred to, may po&s;&s;ibly be urged. <Q>An Unity, (&s;ays he, &s;peaking of the two <HI>Dramas)</HI> and even <HI>Simplicity in the Conduct of the Fable is a Perfection in each.</HI> For the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Affections</HI> is diverted and weakened by the In|tervention of what we call a <HI>double Plot;</HI> and even by a Multiplicity of <HI>&s;ubordinate Events,</HI> though tending to a common <HI>End;</HI> and, of <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> though all of them, &s;ome Way, con|cerned in promoting it. The like Con&s;idera|tion &s;hews the Ob&s;ervance of this <HI>Rule</HI> to be e&s;&s;ential in ju&s;t Comedy.

His Excellencies, for the mo&s;t part, are purely Poetical. But this is far from being the Ca&s;e of all our <HI>Dramatic</HI> Writers. The

Ground-work of the greate&s;t part of our <HI>Engli&s;h Tragedies</HI> is indeed Hi&s;torical; but the Super&s;truc|ture is their own. The whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of Plot, Intrigue, and Contrivance, is generally the Work of the Poets; and a Work, when executed with Art and Judgment, that &s;hews them to be &s;upe|riour at lea&s;t to their Forefathers of <HI>Greece</HI> in the ample Field of Invention (the fir&s;t Point in Poetry): and therefore I &s;hould think &s;ome of Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ions, relating to the kind A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Violin to the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Hero or the Poet on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Stage, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be retorted upon him&s;elf, and tho&s;e who&s;e Cau&s;e he e&s;pou&s;es.

almo&s;t every Compliance with Public Ta&s;te, and the Genius of a People, as mere Complai&s;ance and Servility: I believe a <HI>Greek</HI> Poet now alive would adapt him&s;elf to the Ta&s;te of the Times in more In&s;tances than Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> would allow; and that the&s;e have been occa&s;ionally more or le&s;s con&s;ulted and indulged by all Poets in all Ages.

<Q><P>One rea&s;on of that Succe&s;s (&s;ays he in the above-cited Remarks) is in my Opinion this, that <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> have written to the Genius of the Age and Nation in which they lived: For though Nature, as he (Mr. <HI>Rymer)</HI> objects, is the &s;ame in all Places, and Rea&s;on too the &s;ame; yet the Climate, the Age, the Di&s;po&s;itions of the People to whom a Poet writes, may be &s;o different, that what pleas'd the <HI>Greeks,</HI> would not &s;atisfy an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Au|dience.</P>
<P>And if they proceeded upon a Foundation of truer Rea&s;on to plea&s;e the <HI>Athenians,</HI> than

<P>Whether our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Audience have been plea&s;ed hitherto with Acorns, as he calls it, or with Bread, is the next Que&s;tion; that is, whether the Means which <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> have u&s;ed in their Plays to rai&s;e tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions before-named, be better applied to the Ends by the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, than by them; and perhaps we &s;hall not grant him this wholly. Let it be yielded, that a Writer is not to run down with the Stream, or to plea&s;e the People by their own u&s;ual Methods, but rather to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">+form form their Judgments; it &s;till remains to be proved, that our Theatre needs this total Re|formation.&mdash;The Faults which he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s found in their De&s;igns, are rather wittily aggravated in many Places, than rea&s;onably urg'd; and as much may be returned on the <HI>Greeks,</HI> by one who were as witty as himelf:</P></Q>

Countries, according to the Nature of the Climate, and the Con&s;titution of the People: However, there are &s;ome certain, fix'd, and ac|knowledged Principles of Good Sen&s;e, Nature and Rea&s;on, that are, as Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> ob&s;erves, equally and univer&s;ally, in all Ages and Nations, at lea&s;t all civilized ones, the &s;ame: I believe there has been hardly any Age &s;o illiterate, whim&s;ical, or corrupted in this Sen&s;e, as to explode the&s;e &s;tand|ing Principles; &s;uch for In&s;tance, among many others, are the following: That the <HI>Drama</HI> is to be the true Image and Repre&s;entation of Nature: That this Repre&s;entation can only be exhibited under an infinite Variety of Actions, De&s;igns, Characters, Manners, Sentiments and Expre&s;&s;ions: That with regard to all, and each of the&s;e, Pro|priety, Con&s;i&s;tency, and Probability are mo&s;t ex|actly to be ob&s;erved: That the Motives to all Actions, the Springs of all Pa&s;&s;ions, the Grounds of all Prejudices, the Peculiarities of all Tempers, have one common Foundation, and are produc|tive of their corre&s;pondent Effects, in all Times and Places.&mdash;The Knowlege of the&s;e Things is the Knowlege of Nature, in which the great <HI>Arcana</HI> of all Poetry, and particularly <HI>Dramatic,</HI> are repo&s;ited. To the&s;e, therefore, it is the <HI>Dra|matic</HI> Poets Care mo&s;t heedfully to attend; and to the&s;e he may attend, in Fact, very con&s;i&s;tently, with a Di&s;regard of the Laws of the old <HI>Drama,</HI>
<PB N="280" REF="383">
as might be in&s;tanced in many of our be&s;t Mo|dern Plays, and in almo&s;t all of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s.&mdash;It is, indeed, nothing but this Attention that has &s;o eminently rai&s;ed and pre&s;erved the Reputation of the&s;e latter, notwith&s;tanding the Poet's ab&s;olute Neglect, or rather Defiance of the great Unities contended for as e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>Drama.</HI> And 'tis as certain, that where this Attention is wanting, either through Ignorance or Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, the mo&s;t regular Ob&s;ervance of the&s;e Unities will be found utterly in&s;ufficient for the true Purpo&s;es of Stage-Poetry.</P>
<P>For the&s;e, and the like Rea&s;ons, I think one may venture to conclude, that the Practice of the Antients is by no means a nece&s;&s;ary Standard of <HI>Dramatic</HI> writing, and that the Laws relating to the &s;everal Unities of Action, Time, and Place, though they do indeed con&s;titute a particular Form, or Species of the <HI>Drama,</HI> (and we will grant the mo&s;t <HI>exact</HI> too) yet are by no means e&s;&s;ential to the Nature of it. Whatever is &s;o, cannot be violated or infringed without Contra|diction to the common Judgment of Mankind, and di&s;gu&s;ting at lea&s;t, the more rational Part of an Audience. And accordingly every Defect in the Particulars above-mentioned, is always re|ceived with proportionable Marks of Di&s;appro|bation. But the Ca&s;e is quite different, in re&s;pect of the Liberties <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has taken, which
<PB N="281" REF="384">
therefore, I can never think ab&s;urd or unnatural in them&s;elves. And I am the more confirmed in this Opinion, becau&s;e <HI>John&s;on, Fletcher,</HI> and many others, who were confe&s;&s;edly acquainted with the Genius of ancient <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and, generally &s;peaking, not only affected Art and Regularity in their Writings, but even depended principally upon the&s;e for the Succe&s;s of them, did never|thele&s;s, on many Occa&s;ions, hold them&s;elves free from the Obligation of the Laws at pre&s;ent in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But herein, our modern Refiners will &s;ay they judged wrong; and as to <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> if he has e&s;caped the Severity of Cen&s;ure upon this Head, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed wholly to that Complai&s;ance, which every Generation has thought due to his Excellencies in the <HI>higher Beauties</HI> of Poetry.&mdash;Now this An&s;wer, (and &s;omething to this Effect mu&s;t be the An&s;wer) does it&s;elf &s;uppo&s;e, that the mo&s;t punctual Ob&s;ervance of the old Laws, has no Connection with the <HI>great</HI> Beauties of Poetry, but is only at be&s;t the <HI>mechanical</HI> Part of the <HI>Drama:</HI> However, 'tis pre&s;um'd that the great Name of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> &s;corns to be protected by the Complai&s;ance of his Countrymen; and that the Liberties he has taken, are very far from being indefen&s;ible.&mdash;For is it more improper and irrational, or does it require le&s;s Force of of Genius, and Knowlege of Nature, to trace as
<PB N="282" REF="385">
it were a Pa&s;&s;ion from it's fir&s;t Ri&s;e, through it's Progre&s;s, and to it's final I&s;&s;ue, as that of Jea|lou&s;y in <HI>Othello,</HI> or of Ambition in <HI>Macbeth,</HI> than to repre&s;ent it only at a &s;tated Period, and at a particular Cri&s;is? Or, if the Poet thinks proper to &s;hift the Scene from a <HI>Palace</HI> to a <HI>Heath,</HI> or from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> is it at all more inconvenient or impo&s;&s;ible for his Audience to attend him, than it was to give him the Meeting, and &s;uppo&s;e them|&s;elves in the Place where he laid his fir&s;t Scene? It does not at all appear to me, that a greater Degree of implicit Faith is required in one In|&s;tance than in the other: For he may with equal Probability do both, UT MAGUS, as has been hinted above, and he can do neither but in Qua|lity of the &s;ame. Times and Places are in a great Mea&s;ure at the Command of a Genius; and the Argument drawn from the ab&s;olute Unna|turalne&s;s of every Breach of exact and preci&s;e Unity with regard to them, if it proves any Thing, proves too much; it will prove the Unna|turalne&s;s of the whole <HI>Dramatic Apparatus;</HI> it will demon&s;trate the Impo&s;&s;ibility of exhibiting Woods, Fields, Ca&s;tles, and Towns, in a &s;ingle Room, and the Ab&s;urdity of giving an Ear to a Company of Fidlers, before or after the Solemnity of a Council, or the Tumult of a Battle. In &s;hort, it &s;eems to me a mo&s;t ridiculous <HI>Hypercritici&s;m,</HI> to object to Improprieties which are more or le&s;s

If the Que|&s;tion indeed were, whether of the two be the more <HI>artificial</HI> Model of Tragedy, that of the Ancients, or the Moderns, I would make no Scruple to give up the Argument: But a <HI>regular</HI> and <HI>exact</HI> Model is one Thing, and an <HI>excellent Play</HI> is another; it is one Thing to allow a rea|&s;onable Latitude to a great Genius, and another to pre&s;cribe a Plan to a common Poet.</P>
<P>Were the antient <HI>Greek Tragedians</HI> defective then in Point of Genius, it will be a&s;k'd? Very far from it.&mdash;However, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>Simplicity,</HI> (I had almo&s;t &s;aid <HI>Poverty)</HI> of their Fables, is by no means their &s;triking Beauty; that the&s;e would have appeared to greater Advantage, had they taken greater Liberties; that neither Nature nor Rea&s;on re&s;trained them to the preci&s;e Ob&s;ervation of the three Unities, and that the Cu&s;tom of Antiquity in this Ca&s;e, under the Abilities of a great Ma&s;ter, would (to u&s;e the Words of <HI>Shake&s;pear)</HI> be more frequently <HI>ho|noured in the Breach, than the Ob&s;ervance.</HI></P>

It is plainly for this Rea&s;on that the be&s;t <HI>Tragi-Comedies</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and others are received with general Applau&s;e at this very Day; the Ground of Com|plaint again&s;t &s;uch <HI>Tragic</HI> and <HI>Comic</HI> Union be|ing really not &s;o much that it offends the Judg|ment, as that it improperly divides the Attention. Two &s;eparate Plots, and di&s;tinct Actions do this to a ridiculous Degree; but in one and the &s;ame Action ab&s;olute Uniformity is not e&s;&s;ential either to the <HI>Tragic</HI> or <HI>Comic Drama.</HI> For tho' the
<PB N="287" REF="390">
<HI>Pathos</HI> be the Characteri&s;tic of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and <HI>Hu|mour</HI> of <HI>Comedy,</HI> as well ancient as modern, yet the former will admit of Characters of Plea&s;antry under certain Regulations, and the latter is fre|quently known to abound with Circum&s;tances of very affecting, tho' dome&s;tic Di&s;tre&s;s; of which many In&s;tances might, if need were, be on both &s;ides produced, in the &s;everal <HI>Dramas</HI> both of Antients and Moderns. Nor does &s;uch occa&s;ional and moderate Reciprocation confound or de&s;troy the different Genius, Nature, and End, of the two <HI>Species.</HI> And it was probably owing to &s;ome injudicious Writer's Mi&s;application of this Truth, and his drawing undue and fal&s;e Con&s;equences from it, and even in his own Imagination im|proving it, that either the Name, or the Con&s;ti|tution of <HI>Tragi-Comedy</HI> did ever &s;ub&s;i&s;t. For the Rea&s;ons why <HI>Plautus</HI> calls his <HI>Amphitrion</HI> a <HI>Tragi-Comedy,</HI> are of a Nature entirely different from this. However, the great Objection to this Form of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Compo&s;ition is certainly, as has been &s;aid, that it un&s;uitably divides the Attention, not that it le&s;&s;ens it, or by exciting many different Pa&s;|&s;ions in the &s;ame Space of Time checks the Force of any &s;ingle one. That the Attention in a very uniform and regular Play, may be divided without being le&s;&s;ened, we have already ob&s;erved; and indeed, if this were not the Ca&s;e, ab&s;olute Uni|formity and Simplicity mu&s;t be really e&s;&s;ential to
<PB N="288" REF="391">
the two <HI>Species</HI> of the <HI>Drama,</HI> and every reci|procal Participation will be proportionably, to the Degree of it, ab&s;urd. But to a&s;&s;ert this, would be talking again&s;t Rea&s;on, Experience, and the not uncommon Practice of the be&s;t Poets. Is any Man le&s;s mov'd by the Delicacy and Tenderne&s;s of Lord <HI>Townley,</HI> upon his Separation from his Wife, on Account of the Mirth that was before excited in him, by the ridiculous Ignorance, and Ru&s;ticity of Sir <HI>Francis Wronghead?</HI> Do we le&s;s intere&s;t our&s;elves in the Fate of the unhappy <HI>In|diana,</HI> becau&s;e we were diverted by the cox|combical Pertne&s;s of Mr. <HI>Thomas?</HI> Should we be more affected by the pathetical Complaints of <HI>Romeo,</HI> if they were not contra&s;ted in the Buf|foonery of <HI>Mercutio?</HI> Or, to refer the Reader to a Play or two written directly upon the <HI>Tragi|comic</HI> Plan, does the iniquitous Drollery of the <HI>Spani&s;h Friar</HI> abate our Concern for the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of <HI>Torri&s;mond</HI> and <HI>Leonora?</HI> Or, do the comical <HI>Rhodomontades,</HI> and Humours of <HI>Fal&s;taff</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates, take off our Attention from the Bravery of Prince <HI>Henry</HI> or <HI>Hot&s;pur,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. at the Battle of <HI>Shrew&s;bury.</HI>&mdash;I am very far from contending for this Mixture, not of oppo&s;ite, but indeed con|tradictory Characters, in the &s;ame <HI>Drama,</HI> and much le&s;s for the Form of <HI>Tragi-Comedy</HI> it&s;elf: Proper and due Uniformity admits of &s;ufficient Variety, and though it be not e&s;&s;ential to the
<PB N="289" REF="392">
<HI>Drama,</HI> is no doubt a great Beauty in it: The mo&s;t popular of the Plays I have mentioned, are not the better for their Medley of Characters; but all this while, let the Fault or Impropriety be placed in a fair Light, and a&s;crib'd to it's true Cau&s;e, which is the real, though nice Connection, between the Genius of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and that of <HI>Co|medy,</HI> and the extreme Difficulty of preci&s;ely de|termining how far, or in what Degrees and Pro|portions the one may a&s;&s;ume the Qualities and Properties of the other.</P>
<P>But to return to my Subject:&mdash;The &s;imple Con&s;titution of the ancient <HI>Drama,</HI> has indeed &s;ome Advantages over the more complicated one of &s;ucceeding Ages, but &s;till &s;uch as are abun|dantly more than ballanc'd by tho&s;e of the latter. The frequent &s;hifting of Scenes, for In&s;tance, though it does not offend the Judgment, is yet di&s;gu&s;ting to the Eye of the Spectator, and &s;o far the Continuation of one and the &s;ame Scene, is a peculiar Beauty, and Propriety. But all this while, to this Beauty and local Propriety, many other more important Points of Probability are too often &s;acrific'd. This is, more or le&s;s, I be|lieve, the Ca&s;e of all &s;trictly uniform <HI>Tragedies</HI> and <HI>Comedies,</HI> but evidently, at lea&s;t of &s;ome of our be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h Comedies</HI> that have been written on the old <HI>Dramatic</HI> Plan; in which, notwith&s;tand|ing the Unity of Action, &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s is
<PB N="290" REF="393">
tran&s;acted, &s;o much Intrigue carried on, by &s;o many different Per&s;onages, in one &s;ingle Spot of Ground, as is utterly incredible; in which Ca&s;e the Poet <HI>really</HI> offends again&s;t Rea&s;on, Nature, and good Sen&s;e, purely to &s;ave the <HI>Appearance</HI> of doing &s;o: Indeed if the Unities are e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>Drama,</HI> the utmo&s;t Simplicity will of Cour&s;e be a Perfection in it; and con&s;equently many of the mo&s;t regular Compo&s;itions of our <HI>Comic</HI> Poets (as <HI>the Way of the World,</HI> and the <HI>Double Dealer</HI> of <HI>Congreve)</HI> will be found to be infinitely their wor&s;t Productions: So ambitious have &s;ome been of improving the Model of the antient <HI>Drama,</HI> and yet &s;o cautious at the &s;ame Time of taking &s;uch Liberties as were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e Improvements.</P>
<P>After all, Di&s;cretion is to be a general Rule even in the U&s;e of Liberty. I would neither fetter the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Mu&s;e, nor yet let her run wild; Deviations from the &s;trict Laws of Anti|quity &s;hould be made not affectedly and at ran|dom, but with a View to Beauties of a higher Nature; not for the Ea&s;e of the Poet, but to the Advantage of the Poem. I would not vindicate <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> him&s;elf in every In&s;tance of his Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. To &s;um up all that need be &s;aid upon this Point in a few Words; the old Laws of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> are in my Opinion very proper Regula|tions and Re&s;traints for an indifferent Poet, but ought not to be the Shackles of a good one.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="394">
The other great Point of Difference between the antient and modern <HI>Drama,</HI> is the Di&s;u&s;e of the <HI>Chorus</HI> in the latter; which yet Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> is "willing to think e&s;&s;ential to the Tragic <HI>Drama."</HI> Now admitting the Theory of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> to be not only a regular, but al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary Standard of <HI>Dramatic</HI> Writings, with Re&s;pect to the Unities of Action, Time and Place, the <HI>Chorus,</HI> though not e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>Drama,</HI> will indeed as Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> ob&s;erves <Q>lay a proper and nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;traint upon the Poet.</Q> But if the&s;e Unities them&s;elves are far from being e&s;&s;en|tial to the <HI>Drama,</HI> as we have endeavoured to make it appear, the U&s;e of the <HI>Chorus</HI> is &s;o far at lea&s;t &s;uper&s;eded.&mdash;The <HI>Chorus</HI> was indeed, as I have before ob&s;erved, not only a con&s;tituent Part of, but even a Convenience to the antient <HI>Tragedy.</HI> If I might be excu&s;ed the Indelicacy of the Expre&s;&s;ion for the Significancy of the Senti|ment, I would &s;ay, let a <HI>Tragedy</HI> of <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> be <HI>gutted</HI> of it's <HI>Chorus,</HI> and you leave it little better than a <HI>Skeleton.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed; upon the &s;imple Plan of Anti|quity the <HI>Chorus</HI> introduced, 'tis true, an agreeable Variety into the <HI>Drama,</HI> and was no doubt both u&s;eful and ornamental to it, as it's peculiar Pro|vince had more immediate Reference to the great Ends of all Poetry, <HI>prode&s;&s;e &amp; delectare.</HI> But after all, if the&s;e great Ends are better, or even as well
<PB N="292" REF="395">
an&s;wered without the <HI>Chorus;</HI> and if the&s;e Ends are not ob&s;tructed by the Admi&s;&s;ion of De&s;ign, Contrivance and Intrigue into the Fable, but even promoted by it under the Conduct of a ma&s;terly Hand, in this Ca&s;e, I &s;ay, it is not to be denied but the <HI>Chorus</HI> of the Antients has given Place to it's Betters.&mdash;It is true Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> has very po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted (for I think he has by no Means &s;uffici|ently proved) in Behalf of the old <HI>Chorus,</HI> that (to lay no Stre&s;s upon &s;ubordinate Advantages) it aug|mented the <HI>Pathetic,</HI> that it afforded <Q>a graceful, and natural Re&s;ource to the Embelli&s;hments of picture&s;que De&s;cription, &s;ublime Allegory, and whatever el&s;e comes under the Denomination of pure Poetry;</Q> and la&s;tly, which is mo&s;t material, that it was the propere&s;t Vehicle <Q>to convey mo|ral Reflections with Grace and Propriety.</Q> For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, which re&s;pect both the <HI>Poet</HI> and the <HI>Audience,</HI> he judges the Di&s;u&s;e of the <HI>Chorus</HI> to be an irreparable Lo&s;s to the modern Stage. Let us briefly then review what this Gentleman has &s;aid upon each of the&s;e Articles.</P>
<P>Now with Regard to the fir&s;t he offers us the Authority of a <HI>Frenchman.</HI> <Q>If you a&s;k me (&s;ays he) how it augmented the <HI>Pathetic,</HI> I cannot give you a better An&s;wer than the <HI>Abb&egrave; Vatry</HI> has done in his Di&s;&s;ertation on the Subject pub|li&s;hed in the <HI>Memoirs de l' Acad. des In&s;er.</HI> &amp;c. It affected this (&s;ays he) both in it's <HI>Odes</HI> and
<PB N="293" REF="396">
<HI>Dialogue.</HI> The wonderful Power of Mu&s;ic and the Dance is univer&s;ally allowed. And, as the&s;e were always <HI>Accompaniments</HI> to the Odes, there is no Doubt but they contributed greatly to move the Pa&s;&s;ions. It was nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be Odes or Interludes; but it was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that the&s;e Interludes &s;hould not &s;uffer the Minds of the Audience to cool, but, on the contrary, &s;hould &s;upport and fortify tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which the previous Scenes had already excited. Nothing imaginable could produce this Effect better, than the choral Songs and Dances, which filled the Mind with Ideas corre&s;ponding to the Subject, and never failed to add new Force to the Sentiments of the principal Per&s;onages. In the Dialogue al&s;o, the Chorus &s;erved to move the Pa&s;&s;ions by &s;hew|ing to the Spectators other Spectators &s;trongly affected by the Action. A Spectacle of &s;uch a Kind as is fitted to excite in us the Pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Terrour</HI> and <HI>Pity,</HI> will not of it&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly affect us, as when we &s;ee others al&s;o affected by it. The Painters have generally under&s;tood this Secret, and have had Recour&s;e to an Ex|pedient &s;imilar to that of the <HI>Chorus</HI> of the Poets. Not content with the &s;imple Repre&s;en|tation of an hi&s;torical Event, they have al&s;o added Groupes of a&s;&s;i&s;tant Figures, and expre&s;t in their Faces the different Pa&s;&s;ions, they would
<PB N="294" REF="397">
have their Picture excite. Nay they &s;ome|times inli&s;t into their Service even irrational Animals. In the <HI>Slaughter of the Innocents,</HI> LE BRUN was not &s;atisfied with expre&s;&s;ing all the Horrour, of which the Subject is naturally capable; he has al&s;o painted two Hor&s;es with their Hair &s;tanding on End, and &s;tarting back, as afraid to trample upon the bleeding Infants. This is an Artifice which has often been em|ployed, and which has always &s;ucceeded. A good Poet &s;hould do the &s;ame; and <HI>Iphigenia</HI> &s;hould not be &s;uffered to appear on the Theatre, without being accompanied with Per&s;ons ca|pable of feeling her Misfortunes.</Q></P>
<P>I have tran&s;cribed the whole Pa&s;&s;age, and can't help nothing in the fir&s;t Place, a very extraordinary Inaccuracy in this refin'd Portion of Critici&s;m. For &s;ure the above-mentioned Hor&s;es, with their "Hair &s;tanding on End," and "&s;tarting back," &amp;c. did greatly add to the Horrour of this famous Piece, which yet before had, it &s;eems, all the Horrour expre&s;&s;ed in it, of which the Subject was naturally capable; or, if they did not aug|ment this Horrour, it will be difficult methinks to to tell what Bu&s;ine&s;s they had there. But to be &s;erious:</P>
<P>The wonderful Power of Mu&s;ic is univer&s;ally allow'd; and Mu&s;ic is by no Means excluded from the modern Stage. Nay, I venture to &s;ay, the
<PB N="295" REF="398">
modern <HI>Drama</HI> has Recour&s;e to it more effectually, though le&s;s frequently, than the old <HI>Drama</HI> had; as we are more affected by it's occa&s;ional and un|expected Graces and A&s;&s;i&s;tances, than we &s;hould be by it's &s;tated and periodical Interpo&s;ition.&mdash;For the <HI>Dance,</HI> I own I am at a Lo&s;s to compre|hend how it could contribute greatly to move the Pa&s;&s;ions; I mean the Pa&s;&s;ions proper for Tragedy: I do not pretend to a&s;certain the Nature and Me|thod of the antient <HI>Stage-Dancing;</HI> but &s;uch has been the Power of the <HI>Dance</HI> in later Times, that the <HI>Tragic Mu&s;e,</HI> who is a very <HI>grave Matron,</HI> has, I believe, no Rea&s;on to lament her <HI>dancing Days are over.</HI> Admitting therefore at pre&s;ent the Pro|priety and Efficacy of the <HI>Choral</HI> Songs, I cannot conceive how any Kind of <HI>Dance</HI> <Q>&s;hould &s;up|port and fortify tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which the pre|vious Scenes had excited,</Q> or <Q>fill the Mind with Ideas corre&s;ponding to the Subject, and never fail to add new Force to the Sentiments of the principal Per&s;onages.</Q> Nor farther can I &s;ee any Thing even in the <HI>Songs,</HI> or <HI>Odes,</HI> which had &s;o peculiar a Tendency to produce the&s;e Ef|fects, that nothing imaginable could do it <HI>as well;</HI> for tho' the&s;e might an&s;wer this Purpo&s;e very &s;uf|ficiently, yet if they were not nece&s;&s;ary for it, they cannot be contended for as e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>Drama,</HI> and mu&s;t con&s;equently be con&s;idered only, as we have before ob&s;erved, in the Light of
<PB N="296" REF="399">
an ancient Conveniency.&mdash;Now I apprehend the Minds of the Audience are in no Danger of cool|ing under the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Drama,</HI> and that the Mu&s;ic between the Acts <HI>may</HI> be adapted to the Purpo&s;es fore-named, of &s;upporting and fortifying the Pa&s;&s;ions as much as the old <HI>Chorus</HI> could be. Without depreciating therefore the real U&s;e and De&s;ign of the <HI>Chorus,</HI> we only &s;ay we can do in many Re&s;pects better, and even in this as well without it.</P>
<P>But farther it &s;eems, <Q>In the Dialogue al&s;o, the <HI>Chorus</HI> &s;erved to move the Pa&s;&s;ions, by &s;hew|ing to the Spectators, other Spectators &s;trongly affected by the Action.</Q> For, <Q>a Spectacle of &s;uch a Kind as is fitted to excite in us the Pa&s;&s;ions of Terrour, and Pity, will not of it&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly affect us, as when we &s;ee others al&s;o affected by it.</Q> Admitting the Truth of which A&s;&s;ertion, I do not &s;ee what is to be inferr'd from it to the Advantage of the antient <HI>Chorus.</HI> For does not the modern <HI>Drama</HI> move the Pa&s;|&s;ions (as indeed does the antient exclu&s;ive of it's <HI>Chorus)</HI> by &s;hewing to the Spectators other Per|&s;ons (not mere Spectators, but Per&s;ons more in|tere&s;ted in the Action) &s;trongly affected by the Events of the <HI>Tragedy?</HI> The Intervention there|fore of Spectators, as &s;uch, upon the Stage is with Re&s;pect to this Purpo&s;e &s;uperfluous and in|&s;ignificant, except it can be demon&s;trated that
<PB N="297" REF="400">
the Pa&s;&s;ions of Terrour and Pity, or any other are (if I may be allowed the Expre&s;&s;ion) more power|fully excited at the <HI>&s;econd Rebound.</HI>&mdash;Let common Experience at once illu&s;trate and determine this Matter.&mdash;Suppo&s;ing half a dozen indifferent Per|&s;ons admitted to a Spectacle of Terrour or Di&s;tre&s;s in real Life, for In&s;tance that of a dying Man taking Leave of his Wife, his Mi&s;tre&s;s, or his Friend; would not &s;uch a Spectacle immediately rai&s;e &s;uitable Emotions in all of them, or would each fir&s;t con&s;ult the Pa&s;&s;ions of his next Neighbour in order to learn what Effect this Spectacle ought to have upon him&s;elf? The&s;e Que&s;tions require no An&s;wer; and therefore as the <HI>Drama</HI> is &s;o lively a Repre&s;entation of real Life, they may plainly be applied to any Ca&s;e of Mi&s;ery or Horrour exhibited upon the Stage.&mdash;For this Rea&s;on al&s;o it is, that the Illu&s;tration of the Matter before us by the Expedients of the Painters is, I apprehend, (with Deference to the ingenious <HI>Abb&egrave;</HI> as Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> calls him) entirely foreign to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e. The Painters have very wi&s;ely had Recour&s;e to &s;uch Expedients as are mentioned in the above-quoted Critici&s;m, becau&s;e, after all, their Art is but Painting &s;till, and pro|perly &s;peaking de&s;cribes the Pa&s;&s;ions, more than it excites them; but the <HI>Drama,</HI> or rather the <HI>Actor</HI> in the <HI>Drama, realizes</HI> what he repre&s;ents. He mu&s;t be a very in&s;en&s;ible Spectator, who thinks at
<PB N="298" REF="401">
all of the <HI>Poet</HI> or the <HI>Player,</HI> when Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> is per&s;onating a <HI>Richard,</HI> a <HI>Macbeth,</HI> or a <HI>Lear.</HI> The Poet in &s;hort has not the &s;ame Occa&s;ion for &s;uch Artifices and Expedients as the Painter has. Let <HI>Iphigenia</HI> appear on the Theatre, and behave as &s;he ought to do, and I will be an&s;werable for it, the <HI>Audience</HI> will be <HI>Per&s;ons capable of feeling her Misfortunes.</HI></P>
<P>But again, by rejecting the <HI>Chorus</HI> Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> tells us the true Poet has lo&s;t a <Q>graceful and na|tural Re&s;ource to the Embelli&s;hments of Pictu|re&s;que De&s;cription, &s;ublime Allegory, and whatever el&s;e comes under the Denomination of <HI>pure Poetry.</HI></Q> To which I take Leave to reply, That what the <HI>Poet</HI> has lo&s;t hereby, <HI>Tragedy</HI> has gained; for if Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI>'s own Theory be ju&s;t, the <HI>Tragic Mu&s;e</HI> (as we have before ob|&s;erved from him) &s;trikes directly upon the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of the Audience; which I &s;hould be glad to know how Picture&s;que De&s;cription (I mean &s;uch as this Gentleman has favoured us with) &s;ub|lime Allegory, and <HI>Poetry in the Ab&s;tract,</HI> or, if you plea&s;e, <HI>pure Poetry</HI> can do. Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> &s;ays, the <HI>Lyric Mu&s;e</HI> addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf to the Imagination of a Reader or Hearer; and accordingly <Q>few Men have a Strength of Imagination capable of pur&s;uing the Flights of <HI>Pindar;</HI></Q> and &s;till fewer, I will venture to add, tho&s;e of Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> in this Dramatic Poem. I am very far from meaning to
<PB N="299" REF="402">
decry this ingenious Author's peculiar Talent <HI>in loco;</HI> but I fear in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, while he affects to defend the Cau&s;e of the <HI>old Chorus,</HI> his real De&s;ign was to introduce a <HI>new</HI> one. For, the Name excepted, I can di&s;cern little or nothing in the <HI>Odes</HI> of Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the an|tient <HI>Chorus;</HI> that <Q>poetical Flow of tender Commi&s;eration, of religious Supplication, or of virtuous Triumph,</Q> of which it principally con&s;i&s;ted, had none of the <HI>long-&s;pun</HI> Allegory, and <HI>aerial</HI> Imagery with which the&s;e <HI>Dramatic</HI> Sonnets of Mr. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> abound. In Truth it is to be wi&s;h'd that this profe&s;t Admirer, and Imitator of genu|ine Nature, and antient Simplicity in the <HI>Struc|ture</HI> of his <HI>Fable,</HI> had paid a little more Regard to them in his <HI>Diction</HI> throughout this whole Poem, and particularly in the Stile of the <HI>Choral</HI> Compo&s;itions under pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration.

<HI>not</HI> generally "too much agitated by the furious Pa&s;&s;ions, or attached by the tender ones, to think cooly (enough for the Purpo&s;e) and impre&s;s on the Spectators a moral Sentiment properly."</P>

'Tis true I &s;hould not be &s;orry to &s;ee a <HI>Chorus</HI> on a Theatre, more than as large and as deep again as our's, built and adorned at a King's Charges; and on that Condition, and another, which is, that my Hands were not bound behind me, as now they are, I &s;hould not de&s;pair of making &s;uch a Tragedy, as might be both in&s;tructive and delightful, according to the Manner of the <HI>Grecians.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="417">
Now does any common Reader apprehend from this Pa&s;&s;age, that becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> tells us, he &s;hould not be &s;orry to &s;ee a <HI>Chorus</HI> on a com|modious Theatre, &amp;c. therefore he ardently wi&s;h'd to &s;ee one, and judg'd it ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>Drama;</HI> or becau&s;e he declares that in &s;uch Ca&s;e he &s;hould not <HI>de&s;pair</HI> of making &s;uch a Tragedy as <HI>might</HI> be in&s;tructive and delightful according to the Manner of the <HI>Grecians,</HI> therefore he <HI>long'd</HI> to try his Strength in this Field, and acknow|ledged the grand Secret <HI>prode&s;&s;e &amp; delectare</HI> was the Characteri&s;tic of the <HI>Greek Drama</HI> only?

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Sit down, in compliance with your Reque&s;t, to give you my Sentiments upon the Subject &s;tarted at our la&s;t Interview.&mdash;In con&s;equence of my Re&s;earches upon this Occa&s;ion I have been almo&s;t led into a very whim&s;ical Conclu&s;ion,&mdash;that the greate&s;t Genius is the Author a Man happens to have in his Hand. It &s;eems but rea|&s;onable to pin our Opinion of an Author upon that of his Editor, or Tran&s;lator; and yet we may do this, till we are in a manner at a lo&s;s for a Criterion to judge good Writing by. Genius a&s;&s;umes as many Shapes as ever <HI>Proteus</HI> did; and all literary Merit con&s;i&s;ts principally in Invention, in Judgment, in Fire, in Propriety, in Simplicity, in Elegance, in Accuracy, in Ea&s;e, in Wit, in Humour, in Fullne&s;s, in Brevity, &amp;c. &amp;c. ac|cording to the Spirit, and Complexion of the Writer before me. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> declares, <HI>Homer</HI> was the greate&s;t <HI>Epic</HI> Poet in the World, and I
<PB N="320" REF="422">
am quite of his Mind, till I take up Mr. <HI>Mey|rick</HI>'s <HI>Tryphiodorus.</HI>&mdash;When I look into my <HI>Sta|tius,</HI> I begin to think <HI>Virgil</HI> was a very cold, and in&s;ipid Writer; and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Acquaintance a&s;&s;ure me that <HI>Statius</HI> was little better than a Mad|man.&mdash;In &s;hort by Virtue of the Preface, prefix'd to him, <HI>Sophocles</HI> or <HI>Ovid, Terence</HI> or <HI>Martial, Milton</HI> or <HI>Butler,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. is the be&s;t Poet; <HI>Hero|dotus</HI> or <HI>Eutropius, Livy</HI> or <HI>Sallu&s;t, Rapin</HI> or <HI>Cla|rendon</HI> is the be&s;t Hi&s;torian; <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> or <HI>Newton, De&s;cartes</HI> or <HI>Burnet,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. is the be&s;t Philo|&s;opher; and <HI>Hammond</HI> or <HI>Hobbes, South,</HI> or <HI>To|land, Sherlock</HI> or <HI>Middleton</HI> is the be&s;t Divine.&mdash;</P>
<P>But to be &s;erious.&mdash;You will wonder perhaps to be told, that what gave Ri&s;e to the&s;e ludicrous Remarks of mine was nothing le&s;s than Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Commentary upon his univer&s;ally, and ju&s;tly admir'd Original, <HI>Homer;</HI> an Author, whom you will &s;carce think capable of being compli|mented, or aggrandiz'd to an undue, and ex|travagant Degree, e&s;pecially by &s;o judicious an Editor.&mdash;Indeed the&s;e great Names are &s;o truly venerable, that I mu&s;t obviate the Alarm you may take, by a&s;&s;uring you that what I am going to &s;ay neither can, nor means to detract from the infinite Merit of the <HI>Grecian,</HI> or the <HI>Briti&s;h Homer;</HI> for the former, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Note at v. 955 of the 16th B. of the Iliad.</NOTE><Q>I believe upon the
<PB N="321" REF="423">
whole that &s;carce any Mortal ever came near him for Wi&s;dom, Learning, and all good Qua|lities,</Q> for the latter, He has certainly done more Ju&s;tice to his Author as an Expo&s;itor only, than all the Commentators, antient and modern, put together. After this Declaration you will give me leave to tell you, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf appears to me, notwith&s;tanding his very great Abilities, to have &s;ometimes mi&s;apprehended the real De&s;ign of his Original, to have not unfre|quently (to u&s;e his own Words again) <Q>attribu|ted to him what does not belong to him,</Q> and now and then to have imagin'd Proprieties, or cover'd Defects with a &s;eeming View rather to the Honour of his Author at all Events, than to the preci&s;e A&s;certainment of Truth. All this, indeed, might be owing not to a blind Admira|tion, or to a Want of Di&s;cernment, but to a De|gree of laudable Partiality, or a too implicit Ad|herence to the Notions, and Interpretations of the Commentators his Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>But whatever may be allow'd to an Editor, or Tran&s;lator, a Stander-by will be more im|partial, and is, as &s;uch, more likely to think ju&s;tly of an Author. You who turn to your <HI>Homer</HI> merely with an Intent to be delighted with him, and con&s;ider Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> as a Per&s;on very able and willing to illu&s;trate his great Beau|ties, and Excellencies, will be apt to &s;ce no
<PB N="322" REF="424">
Grounds for the above Allegations, but in an Affectation of Singularity, or in Caprice; e&s;pe|cially as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> makes no Scruple occa&s;ionally to point out the Blemi&s;hes of his Author, and &s;eems by many Remarks to &s;hew him&s;elf thoroughly dive&s;ted of all unrea&s;onable Prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Note at V. 801. B. xi.</NOTE> It is cu&s;tomary (&s;ays he) with tho&s;e who tran&s;late or comment on an Author, to u&s;e him as they do their Mi&s;tre&s;s; they can &s;ee no Faults, or convert his very Faults into Beauties; but I cannot be &s;o partial to <HI>Homer,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> In another Place after having enume|rated what &s;eem'd to him to be <Q>Faults of any con&s;ideration,</Q> he tells us, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Note at V. 955. B. xvi.</NOTE><Q>he hopes after &s;o free a Confe&s;&s;ion no rea&s;onable Modern will think him touch'd with the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> and others. I am &s;en&s;ible, continues he, of the Extremes which Mankind run into, in extolling and depreciating Authors: We are not more violent and unrea&s;onable in attacking tho&s;e who are not yet e&s;tabli&s;h'd into Fame, than in defending tho&s;e who are, even in every minute Trifle.</Q>&mdash;There is as much Mode&s;ty as there is Truth in this ingenuous Declaration; and there is great Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in general never &s;peaks of <HI>Homer</HI> in higher Terms than he really believ'd he de&s;erves.
<PB N="323" REF="425">
However, whether I have been actuated by a Spirit of Vanity, or of Humour, rather than ju&s;t Critici&s;m, you will be able to judge when you have read the following Sheets, in which I pro|po&s;e to try <HI>Homer</HI> by him&s;elf, (as every Writer &s;hould by his own Key) and by the Suffrages and Evidence of his own Advocates, and Witne&s;&s;es. For which Purpo&s;e, and for &s;omething of Method's &s;ake, the fir&s;t Subject of our Inquiry &s;hall be the <HI>Machinery</HI> of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and the next, the general <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of this great Poet, and his particular Conduct in Re&s;pect of <HI>Characters, Incidents,</HI> and other Circum&s;tances. And, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, the Re&s;ult of this Inquiry will be your agreeing with me that <HI>Homer,</HI> with the mo&s;t fruitful In|vention, exten&s;ive Knowledge, and no &s;mall Judg|ment, has really much le&s;s Art, and De&s;ign in this Work, than he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had; at lea&s;t for what appears to the contrary from the Ob&s;ervations of his Commentators.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Machinery,</HI> you know, is that Part which the <HI>Gods</HI> bear in an <HI>Epic</HI> Poem. That of <HI>Homer</HI> is conducted with extraordinary Circum&s;tances of Solemnity, and Magnificence. But the great Que&s;tion is, whether we are in ge|neral to take the Simple and literal Sen&s;e of
<PB N="324" REF="426">
the Author with regard to the Appearance, and Actions of the&s;e &s;uperiour Beings; or whether we are to &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ecret, and allegorical Mean|ing to be veil'd under all this <HI>Apparatus;</HI> or, in other Words, whether we can with any Degree of Certainty extract a Sy&s;tem of Morality, or Theology from it. This has been attempted to be done by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> and all others who have undertaken to explain, illu&s;trate, or defend the Writings of this inimitable Poet; and it mu&s;t be own'd too that this has been done in many Places in a very plau&s;ible Manner. However I mu&s;t be of Opinion, upon reviewing the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and com|paring it with it&s;elf, that the&s;e Gentlemen have pu&s;h'd this Matter too far, and by &s;train'd Expli|cations, and Refinements, found out My&s;teries which were never intended; that, generally &s;peak|ing, we &s;hall do more Ju&s;tice, and even Ho|nour to <HI>Homer</HI> by &s;uppo&s;ing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Note at L. 422. B. V.</NOTE><Q>he follow'd Fame, and common Opinion in his Account of the Gods, though no way agreeable to Truth.</Q> Upon this Suppo&s;ition at lea&s;t, He will, I think appear much more uniform, and reconcileable with him&s;elf. I do not deny indeed that the <HI>Iliad</HI> abounds with noble, and rational Sentiments, and &s;uch as are conformable to true Theology; particularly that the Nece&s;&s;ity of Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="325" REF="427">
and Interpo&s;ition for all Human Succe&s;&s;es is a Moral &s;trongly inculcated throughout the Poem. But whatever <HI>Homer</HI>'s religious Notions, as a <HI>Man,</HI> might be, or, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <Q>whatever he might <HI>think</HI> of his Gods, he took them as he found them; he brought them into Action according to the Notions which were then entertain'd, and in &s;ome Stories as they were then believ'd.</Q> If you con&s;ider his <HI>Jupi|ter</HI> as a <HI>Fabulous</HI> or <HI>Poetical</HI> Character, there is le&s;s in it to &s;hock you; but if you believe, He meant to exhibit to his Reader under this Character, "the One, &s;upreme, omnipotent God" You mu&s;t &s;oon have a very mean Opinion not only of his Philo&s;ophy, but even of his Sen&s;e. 'Tis true, <Q>He &s;ometimes introduces <HI>Jupiter</HI> with a Maje&s;ty, and Superiority worthy the great Ruler of the Univer&s;e,</Q> particularly in the Beginning of the 8th Book; but he is in general repre&s;ented as much &s;ubject to Weakne&s;s, In|firmity, and Pa&s;&s;ion as the inferiour Deities. In|deed, if any Divine Attribute be plainly, and con&s;i&s;tently applied to <HI>Jupiter,</HI> it is <HI>Power;</HI> yet even this &s;eems to be applied rather from the Au|thority of <HI>Fabulous Tradition,</HI> than by the <HI>religious Theory</HI> of the Poet him&s;elf. For the Story of the Rebellion of the Gods, and their Defeat by <HI>Jupi|ter,</HI> which <HI>Homer</HI> refers to, cannot be under&s;tood to be his own Invention. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> acknowleges

<P>I leave it to you to judge what Sort of a Salvo this mu&s;t be, allowing any Foundation for the Di&s;tinction it&s;elf; as indeed I do not recollect there is. There &s;eems at lea&s;t to be univer&s;al Jollity in Heaven in one very remarkable Pa&s;&s;age, without any re&s;erve for the Gravity of this Deity; I mean in the fir&s;t Book, where <HI>Vulcan</HI> <Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See at L. 771. of the 1&s;t B.</NOTE> de&s;igns

<P>Thus you &s;ee the <HI>Jupiter</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> with all his Pomp and Preeminence, is hardly above a Level with the &s;ubordinate Deities in point of corporal Weakne&s;s and Infirmity; nor will you find him to rank much higher if you take a View of his Conduct, and Actions in general throughout the Poem. You will ob&s;erve him upon numberle&s;s Occa&s;ions under the Influence of Pa&s;&s;ions utterly un&s;uitable to the Purity, as well as Dignity of the Supreme Being. The Fiction of his <Q>being deceiv'd and laid a&s;leep,</Q> and of his amorous corre&s;pondence with <HI>Juno,</HI> has, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> con|fe&s;&s;es, as great <Q>an Air of Impiety, and Ab|&s;urdity</Q> as any Fable in all Antiquity. <Q>I <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 179. of the 14th B.</NOTE>mu&s;t needs, upon the whole, (&s;ays that in|genious Remarker) as far as I can judge, give up the Morality of this Fable; but what Colour of Excu&s;e for it <HI>Homer</HI> might have from antient Tradition, or what my&s;tical, or allegorical Sen&s;e might atone for the appearing Impiety, is hard to be a&s;certain'd at this di&s;tant Period of Time.</Q> Here is a Condemnation, and a
<PB N="329" REF="431">
Palliation of a Fault in one Breath. Indeed Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> thro' his unabated Zeal for the Honour of his Original, is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Note la&s;t referred to.</NOTE>willing afterwards to &s;uppo&s;e the "pre&s;ent Pa&s;&s;age to be grounded on Religion," and to be nothing more than the <Q>Repre&s;entation of a religious Solemnity; or el&s;e to be purely allegorical, and as &s;uch implying only</Q> the Congre&s;s of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and <HI>Juno,</HI> the Mingling of the <HI>Aether</HI> and the <HI>Air</HI> (which are generally &s;aid to be &s;ignified by the&s;e two Deities.)

For what Connection is there in the Mingling of the <HI>Aether</HI> and the <HI>Air</HI> with the Matter in Hand? or how does it in the lea&s;t effect the Circum&s;tances of the Battle between the <HI>Greeks</HI> and the <HI>Trojans.</HI> To &s;ay nothing of <HI>Venus,</HI> who certainly is no <HI>Phy&s;ical</HI> Deity, and yet bears a part in this Tran&s;|action.&mdash;The literal, and obvious Sen&s;e of <HI>Homer</HI> with all its Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s &s;eems to be the only con|&s;i&s;tent one which this Pa&s;&s;age can fairly be made to carry.</P>

<P><Q>THE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 422. B. v.</NOTE>famous Cen&s;ure of <HI>Tully,</HI> and <HI>Lon|ginus</HI> (mentioned by Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> that <HI>Homer makes God's of his Heroes, and Mortals of his Gods,</HI></Q> will appear to be groundle&s;s, if you regulate your Ideas of this Author by the Notions I have conceived of him. For pure <HI>Poetical</HI> Fictions, whether invented or adopted by <HI>Homer,</HI> come not properly under the Cog|ni&s;ance of a <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI> Inquiry. Accordingly we &s;hall not only have a ready Excu&s;e for this great Poet when he introduces his Deities <Q>fea&s;t|ing, fighting, wounded by Men, and &s;hedding a Sort of Blood;</Q> but al&s;o when they are repre&s;en|ted as committing Actions unworthy of them&s;elves, and of the re&s;pective Characters they are &s;uppo&s;ed by the common Opinion of Commentators to &s;u&s;|tain. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> allows that <Q>if <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 96.

<PB N="333" REF="435">
break the Treaty is a Que&s;tion, it will be very Material, and, I think, ea&s;y to determine. Now that "the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 18. B. iv.</NOTE>Conditions of the Treaty were valid" notwith&s;tanding the &s;natching away of <HI>Paris</HI> by <HI>Venus</HI> in a Cloud, "that is to &s;ay, that" the Con|trover&s;y was to be decided <HI>(either)</HI> by the <HI>Victory,</HI> or by the <HI>Death</HI> of one of the Combatants, is, I apprehend, apparent from many Con&s;iderations. It is certain, <Q>in the fir&s;t propo&s;al of the Challenge <HI>Paris</HI> mentions only the Victory, <HI>And who his Rival &s;hall in Arms Subdue;</HI></Q> nor does <HI>Hector,</HI> who carries it, &s;ay any more.</P>
<P>However (continues the Note) <HI>Menelaus</HI> un|der&s;tands it of the Death by what he replies:
<Q><L>Fall he that mu&s;t beneath his Rivals Arms,</L>
<L>And live the re&s;t&mdash;</L></Q>
And in the &s;olemn Oath too <HI>Agamemnon</HI> &s;pecifies the latter, <HI>"If by Paris &s;lain"</HI>&mdash;and <Q><HI>If by my Brother's Arms the</HI> TROJAN <HI>bleed.</HI></Q> <HI>Priam</HI> al&s;o under&s;tands it of both, &s;aying, at his leaving the Field,
<Q><L>Who&s;e Arms &s;hall conquer, and who&s;e Prince &s;hall fall,</L>
<L>Heav'n only knows&mdash;</L></Q>
<HI>Paris</HI> him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es he has lo&s;t the Victory in his Speech to <HI>Helen,</HI> which he would hardly have done had the whole depended upon that alone; and la&s;tly <HI>Menelaus</HI> (after the Conque&s;t is clearly
<PB N="334" REF="436">
his by the Flight of <HI>Paris)</HI> is &s;till &s;earching round the Field to kill him, as if all were of no Effect without the Death of his Adver&s;ary.&mdash;It appears from hence (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> <Q>that the <HI>Trojans</HI> had no ill pretence to break the Treaty, &s;o that <HI>Homer</HI> ought not to have been directly accu&s;ed of making <HI>Jupiter</HI> the Author of Perjury in what follows, which is one of the chief of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Ob|jections again&s;t him.</Q></P>
<P>But was it not extremely natural for <HI>Menelaus, Agamemnon,</HI> and <HI>Priam</HI> to <HI>mention</HI> the <HI>Death</HI> of one of the Combatants as the Deci&s;ion of the Controver&s;y, tho' the Terms at the Challenge <HI>&s;pecified Victory</HI> only, in as much as the <HI>Death</HI> of one &s;eem'd to be the unavoidable Con&s;equence of the Duel, and the Deliverance of <HI>Paris</HI> by <HI>Venus</HI> was a Circum&s;tance that could not po&s;&s;ibly be fore&s;een? For <HI>Paris,</HI> he could not be &s;o ab|&s;urd as to deny the Lo&s;s of the Victory, whatever Shifts he might be drove to evade the Articles of the Combat&mdash;indeed he &s;eems to hint at the Expedient of a &s;econd Engagement.&mdash;
<Q><L>This Day the Foe prevail'd by <HI>Pallas'</HI> pow'r;</L>
<L>We yet may vanqui&s;h in a happier Hour.&mdash;</L></Q>
And la&s;tly, for <HI>Menelaus,</HI> he might very naturally "&s;earch round the Field to kill his Adver&s;ary" not for the effectual Determination of the Con|trover&s;y, but for the Gratification of his <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Re&s;entment.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="437">
Be this as it will; whatever private Per&s;ons might think of this Affair, it is plain the <HI>Greeks</HI> looked upon the War as ended by this great Event, and accordingly <HI>Agamemnon</HI> calls upon the <HI>Trojans</HI> to fulfill the Conditions of the Treaty.</P>

<P>The&s;e two la&s;t Circum&s;tances Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> for Rea&s;ons obvious enough, takes not the lea&s;t Notice of: Indeed he found him&s;elf &s;o pre&s;t by the Dif|ficulties with which this whole Tran&s;action is &s;ur|rounded, that he is forced to have Recour&s;e to one of the Expedients above-mentioned, viz. that of &s;uppo&s;ing, <Q><HI>Homer</HI>'s Heaven to be <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> no more than an ideal World of ab&s;tracted Be|ings, &amp;c. &amp;c. agreeably to this Notion he re|&s;olves the Bu&s;ine&s;s into this <HI>ea&s;y Allegory,</HI> as

<P>It belongs to the Advocates of the common No|tion to &s;olve all the&s;e Difficulties, and many more that might be added to them.&mdash;In the mean Time I would have you turn your Eyes to a Pa&s;|&s;age or two, where the <HI>Allegory</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;elf-evident, and tell me whether the Matter be &s;o undeniably clear as the Illu&s;trations of the Commentators pretend to make it. The De&s;cent of <HI>Minerva</HI> in the fir&s;t Book to prevent <HI>Achilles'</HI> attempting the Life of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is de&s;canted upon at large as a Pa&s;&s;age of this Nature. <Q>The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 261.

All this is a mo&s;t beautiful Pa&s;&s;age, who&s;e Moral is evident, and generally agreed on by the Commentators.</Q></P>
<P>Now had <HI>Minerva</HI> only been the Actre&s;s in this Affair, all this had been a very natural <HI>Explica|tion;</HI> but <HI>Homer</HI> gives us to under&s;tand that <HI>Mi|nerva</HI> was <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L. 262.</NOTE>di&s;patched by <HI>Juno</HI> (the Godde&s;s of <HI>Honour)</HI> on this Errand.

<P>Now in the fir&s;t Place it by no Means appears that this Commi&s;&s;ion was expired, or that Fa|culty ceas'd; at lea&s;t the contrary may be in|ferred from Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Tran&s;lation of this Speech. <HI>Diomed</HI> &s;ays but two Lines above
<Q><L>Unhappy they, and born of luckle&s;s Sires,</L>
<L>Who tempt our Fury when <HI>Minerva</HI> fires! <BIBL>l. 157.</BIBL></L></Q>
After all, why &s;hould he torment him&s;elf with Reflections on what he had done only by Virtue of that <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> before, which he was far from
<PB N="357" REF="459">
exceeding except in his Attempt upon <HI>Apollo,</HI> from whom however upon the fir&s;t Reproof he retired? Or, why &s;hould the Example of <HI>Lycur|gus,</HI> who acted not by divine Impul&s;e, terrify one who confe&s;&s;edly did? In this Light what will become of the <HI>allegorical</HI> Characters of <HI>Minerva, Mars,</HI> and <HI>Venus;</HI> or how comes a Hero to be troubled in Con&s;cience becau&s;e he had been re|&s;i&s;ting <HI>Incontinence,</HI> and <HI>ungoverned Fury?</HI> Thus you find this Allegory, which we were told lies &s;o open, is clogged likewi&s;e with its Difficulties; from which indeed neither is the literal Con&s;truc|tion of the Pa&s;&s;age clear; for it &s;eems unrea&s;on|able that a Man &s;hould &s;uffer from the Re&s;ent|ment of one God for what he committed by the Direction, and Command of another; though this is no unu&s;ual Thing in <HI>Pagan</HI> Story.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, to have done with the <HI>Ma|chinery</HI> of this great Poet, I leave it to you to judge, whether there is not abundant Ground to conclude, that the Interpreters have <HI>frequently</HI> taken Pains to a&s;certain a Meaning in him which never came into his Head; that if he had a latent and &s;ymbolical Meaning, at lea&s;t they have not hit upon it, and that there is more Ingenuity than Solidity, as we have hinted, in many of their Interpretations. In a Word, I cannot &s;ee how any thing like a regular and con&s;i&s;tent Sy&s;tem either of Theology, or of Morality, can be ex|tracted
<PB N="358" REF="460">
from <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Machinery</HI>&mdash;if he drops a Sentiment or an Expre&s;&s;ion occa&s;ionally, as he often does, with a View one would think to con|vince his Reader of the Rectitude of his <HI>private</HI> Notions with Regard to the Deity, his <HI>Jupiter</HI> appears to have been a <HI>fabulous</HI> and <HI>traditional</HI> Character, and is drawn with Imperfections, and Infirmities incompatible with the natural Ideas of a &s;upreme Being. As to the inferior Deities it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to form a preci&s;e Idea of their hidden Significancy, or <HI>allegorical</HI> Importance, from the Actions which we have &s;een a&s;cribed to them: So that <HI>Homer</HI> had really much <HI>le&s;s De&s;ign</HI> in the Plan of his Poem than is &s;uppo&s;ed (on which Suppo&s;ition he may however be plainly made more uniform, and of a Piece) or he had much <HI>more</HI> than has ever yet been, or we may &s;uppo&s;e <HI>now</HI> ever will be, comprehended.

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper to remind you in this Place that I neither have &s;aid, nor &s;hall &s;ay any thing of <HI>Homer</HI> with an Intent to <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> your Opi|nion of him, but to <HI>&s;et it right;</HI> for it is one Thing to undervalue a Poet, and another to un|deceive the Reader. If <HI>Homer</HI> be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> Geniu&s;es the World has pro|duced,
<PB N="359" REF="461">
(perhaps the greate&s;t) it is to be remem|bered that he is one of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> too; and it is ab&s;urd to look for that Perfection in the <HI>Original,</HI> which we have a Right to expect in the <HI>Copy.</HI> It is the Characteri&s;tic of <HI>Invention</HI> to be <HI>great,</HI> of <HI>Imitation,</HI> to be <HI>exact;</HI> and if <HI>Virgil</HI> could not have improved the Model of the <HI>Epopee</HI> left him by <HI>Homer,</HI> he &s;hould not have taken a Pen in his Hand. The <HI>Intervention</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> with all his De|fects will always be the Object of our <HI>Admiration;</HI> the <HI>Judgment</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI> with all his Proprieties will only de&s;erve our <HI>Prai&s;e.</HI>&mdash;I own it has often amazed me to find the Commentators &s;o confident to deny, or &s;olicitous to extenuate <HI>Homer</HI>'s De|fects, which really do no Di&s;credit to him, and which ought to be imputed to that <HI>Simplicity</HI> with which every <HI>original</HI> Production of the human Mind is naturally imagined. It is, I apprehend, for want of con&s;idering this great Author in this Light, that the Expo&s;itors often run into the op|po&s;ite Extreme, and are indu&s;trious to di&s;cover Beauties and Excellencies which were merely acci|dental, and ought rather to be put to the Account of the Editor's Affection or Sagacity, than to that of the Art, or De&s;ign of the Author.&mdash;Un|der this Notion I have already &s;ubmitted to your Con&s;ideration my Sentiments on <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Machines;</HI> and agreeably to my Propo&s;al I &s;hall next give you my Thoughts upon the Plan or Oeconomy of
<PB N="360" REF="462">
the <HI>Iliad</HI> in general, and then proceed to a Re|view of the Poet's Conduct in &s;ome particular In|&s;tances. Now, I think, it may be noted as a Defect in the general Oeconomy of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> which is to be a&s;cribed to the Cau&s;e ju&s;t men|tioned, that the Poet has not taken &s;ufficient Care to intere&s;t his Readers on the Side of his Countrymen, notwith&s;tanding the apparent Ju&s;tice of their Cau&s;e. This is clear to me from &s;everal Con&s;iderations, as fir&s;t from the Countenance and Protection given to the <HI>Trojans</HI> in general by <HI>Ju|piter,</HI> in Preference to the <HI>Greeks.</HI>&mdash;I am very &s;en&s;ible the Commentators repre&s;ent this Protec|tion as the Con&s;equence <HI>only</HI> of that God's Promi&s;e to <HI>Thetis,</HI> to humble the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and do Honour to <HI>Achilles.</HI>&mdash;But is it not as plain too, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> throughout the Poem is <HI>per&s;onally</HI> well|affected to <HI>Troy</HI> in general, and that for very good Rea&s;ons? It appears from <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s An&s;wer to <HI>Thetis,</HI> that he had declared him&s;elf in the In|tere&s;t of the <HI>Trojans</HI> long before &s;he made this Application to him,</P>

<P>And he afterwards, in the Council wherein he in|timates him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to end the War, with the

Approbation of the other Deities, by &s;uffering the Treaty made upon the Duel of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> to take Effect, expre&s;&s;es a more than ordi|nary Concern for <HI>Troy,</HI> as a Place that de&s;erved well at his Hands.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has a Note from <HI>Dacier,</HI> which corro|borates what I have remarked upon this Head. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 9. B. iv.</NOTE> <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Reproaching the&s;e two Godde&s;&s;es <HI>(Juno</HI> and <HI>Pallas)</HI> with neglecting to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Menelaus</HI> (in the Duel) proceeds from the Af|fection he bore to <HI>Troy;</HI> &s;ince if <HI>Menelaus</HI> had gained by their Help a complete Victory, <HI>(which it has been ob&s;erved, was a &s;ufficient one)</HI> the Siege had been rai&s;ed, and the City delivered. On the contrary, <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Minerva</HI> might &s;uffer <HI>Paris</HI> to e&s;cape, as the Method to con|tinue the War, to the total De&s;truction of <HI>Troy;</HI> and accordingly a few Lines after we find them
<PB N="362" REF="464">
complotting together, and contriving a new Scene of Mi&s;eries to the <HI>Trojans.</HI></Q> The latter Part of this Note confirms what has been before ob&s;erved, that the&s;e Godde&s;&s;es &s;eem to have been actuated by a Spirit of the mo&s;t inveterate Malice, and Animo&s;ity again&s;t a whole Race <Q><HI>Unius ob|noxam.</HI></Q> The Re&s;titution of <HI>Helen,</HI> &amp;c. was not the grand Object of their Coun&s;els.</P>
<P>Indeed, if you take them in the Gro&s;s, I be|lieve you will find the Deities on the Side of <HI>Troy</HI> (tho' <HI>Mars</HI> is in the Number) to be more gentle, and mercifully inclined, than tho&s;e that are the A&s;&s;i&s;tants of the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I can't help being of Opinion that upon the whole, the Poet gives us a much more favour|able Idea of the <HI>Trojans,</HI> than he does of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> if we regard the <HI>Manners,</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of the Heroes concerned on both Sides. Let us take a &s;hort Vew of the principal Per&s;onages that fight in the Cau&s;e of <HI>Troy. Hector,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ays, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 53. B. iii.</NOTE> if he is not the chief Hero in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> is at lea&s;t the mo&s;t amiable, and is for &s;everal Rea&s;ons a favourite Character with every Rea|der.</Q>&mdash;<Q>He &s;tands in contra&s;t to <HI>Achilles,</HI> an accompli&s;hed Character of Valour, unruffled by Rage, and Anger, and uniting his People by his Prudence, and Example.</Q> <Q>It is the
<PB N="363" REF="465">
Love of his Country, which appears his principal Pa&s;&s;ion, and the Motive of all his Actions. He has no other Blemi&s;h than that he fights in an unju&s;t Cau&s;e, which <HI>Homer</HI> has yet been careful to tell us he would not do, if his Opinion were followed.</Q> <Q>We may add, that <HI>Homer,</HI> having &s;o many <HI>Greeks</HI> to celebrate, makes them &s;hine it their Turns, &amp;c. whereas <HI>Hector</HI> appears in every Battle the Life and Soul of his Party, and the con&s;tant Bul|wark again&s;t every Enemy; he &s;tands again&s;t <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Magnanimity, <HI>Diomed</HI>'s Bravery, <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Strength, and <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Fury.</Q></P>
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 212.

It is the Manner of <HI>Homer</HI> to expre&s;s very &s;trongly the Character of each of his Per|&s;ons in the fir&s;t Speech he is made to utter in the Poem. In this of <HI>Aeneas</HI> there is a great Air of <HI>Piety</HI> in tho&s;e Strokes, <HI>Is he &s;ome God who puni&s;hes</HI> TROY <HI>for having neglected his Sacrifices?</HI> and then in that Sentence, <HI>the Anger of Heaven is Terrible.</HI></Q>
<P>In a Word, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> tells us in another Place. <Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 345. B. xx.</NOTE> Tho' <HI>Aeneas</HI> is repre&s;ented a Man of great Courage, yet his Piety is his mo&s;t &s;hining

<P>The Character of <HI>Sarpedon,</HI> &s;ays the &s;ame Com|mentator, is the <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 512.

His Qualities are no way unworthy his De&s;cent, &s;ince he every where appears equal in Valour, Prudence, and Eloquence to the mo&s;t admired Heroes: Nor are the&s;e Excellencies blemi&s;hed with any of tho&s;e Defects with which the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Characters of the Poem are &s;tain|ed; &s;o that the nice&s;t Criticks cannot find any Thing to offend their Delicacy, but mu&s;t be obliged to own the Manners of this Hero per|fect. His Valour is neither ra&s;h, nor boi&s;terous, his Prudence neither timorous, nor tricking; and his Eloquence, neither talkative, nor boa&s;t|ing. He never reproaches the Living, nor in&s;ults the Dead; but appears uniform thro' his Con|duct in the War, acting with the &s;ame generous Sentiments that engaged him in it; having no intere&s;t in the Quarrel, but to &s;uccour his Allies in di&s;tre&s;s. This noble Life is ended with a Death as glorious; for in his la&s;t Moments he has no other Concern, but for the Honour of his
<PB N="365" REF="467">
Friends, and the Event of the Day.</Q>&mdash;<Q>His is the only Death in the <HI>Iliad</HI> attended with Prodigies; even his Funeral is performed by divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, he being the only Hero who&s;e Body is carried back to be interred in his native Country, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;<Q>The&s;e peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing Honours &s;eem appropriated by our Author to him alone, as the Reward of a Merit &s;uperiour to all his other le&s;s perfect Heroes.</Q> The&s;e are the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Cha|racters on the Side of <HI>Troy;</HI> tho' the inferiour ones, if not &s;o &s;triking, are at lea&s;t generally ami|able and inoffen&s;ive; as tho&s;e of <HI>Deiphobus, He|lenus, Polydamas,</HI> and <HI>Glaucus.</HI> Even that of <HI>Paris</HI> is upon the whole far from being odious, or di&s;gu&s;ting. I believe, among other Things the Value every Reader has for the&s;e Characters, par|ticularly his Love and E&s;teem of <HI>Hector,</HI> inclines his Wi&s;hes to the Side of <HI>Troy.</HI> Indeed Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has (perhaps unde&s;ignedly) given us in the above Accounts of <HI>Sarpedon,</HI> a kind of Contra&s;t to the Manners, and Characters of many of the Leaders in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army. For the Valour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and of <HI>Diomed</HI> is undoubtedly <HI>ra&s;h,</HI> and <HI>boi&s;terous;</HI> the Prudence of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is &s;ometimes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 121. B. viii.</NOTE><HI>timorous;</HI> and the Eloquence of <HI>Idomeneus,</HI> and <HI>Nector</HI> is <HI>talkative</HI> and <HI>boa&s;ting.</HI> But what Pre|judices
<PB N="366" REF="468">
us more than any Thing el&s;e again&s;t the <HI>Greeks,</HI> is that Cruelty, and Inhumanity which is &s;o remarkable in their Chiefs of the fir&s;t Note, and Figure. Granting <HI>Achilles</HI> in all he does to act in Character, and &s;uitably to his <Q>ferocious and vindictive Spirit</Q> the very Nature of the Character it&s;elf is offen&s;ive, and the Propriety and Coherence with which it is pre&s;erved, di&s;ta&s;teful. <Q>His Inhumanity in dragging the dead Body of <HI>Hector</HI> has been &s;everely (and I think indeed not without &s;ome Ju&s;tice, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Pope)</HI> cen|&s;ured by &s;everal, both Antients, and Moderns.</Q> Indeed the Que&s;tion is whether the whole Picture of <HI>Achilles</HI> as drawn by <HI>Homer,</HI> has not &s;tronger, and more violent Features in it than Nece&s;&s;ity re|quired? The Subject of the Poem is the Anger of this Hero, and the ill Con&s;equences of it to the <HI>Greeks;</HI> but this brutal Treatment of the Body of a generous Enemy, is neither the natural Effect of <HI>that</HI> Anger, nor a Soldier-like Revenge for the Death of his Friend <HI>Patroclus.</HI>&mdash;'Tis true, the Commentators have ob&s;erved that, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 137. B. xvii.</NOTE> <HI>Homer</HI> takes Care before Hand, to le&s;&s;en in his Rea|der's Mind the Horrour he may conceive from the Cruelty which <HI>Achilles</HI> will exerci&s;e upon the Body of <HI>Hector,</HI> by &s;hewing this Cruelty as the Puni&s;hment only of that which <HI>Hector</HI>
<PB N="367" REF="469">
exerci&s;es upon the Body of <HI>Patroclus;</HI> he drags him; he <HI>de&s;igns</HI> to cut off his Head, and to leave his Body upon the Ramparts, expo&s;ed to Dogs, and Birds of Prey.</Q> The Ob&s;ervation is founded on Fact; but however as this Piece of <HI>intended</HI> Cruelty is incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Hector</HI>'s gene|ral Character, he &s;hould not have been repre&s;en|ted as capable of it, and as it was only <HI>intended,</HI> it makes not &s;o horrible an Impre&s;&s;ion upon us as the <HI>actual</HI> Inhumanity of the Poet's favour|rite Hero. I have often thought by the way, that the Barbarity of <HI>Achilles</HI> towards the Re|mains of the unfortunate, and univer&s;ally beloved <HI>Hector,</HI> occa&s;ioned the Mi&s;repre&s;entation of the very Fact of his Death by the well-known Story, (which <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> adheres to in his <HI>Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ida)</HI> of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s ungenerou&s;ly attacking him unarmed, and cutting him to Pieces.&mdash;So de|&s;irous was the exa&s;perated Author to depreciate the Character of this Hero, and exalt that of his Adver&s;ary. But to return; be the Charac|ter of <HI>Achilles</HI> as "poetically perfect" as po&s;&s;ible, and the Morality to be drawn from it as obvious as you plea&s;e, he &s;eems to have the lea&s;t Merit of any of the principal Per&s;onages in the Poem, and we can &s;carce help being &s;orry to &s;ee &s;o many dete&s;table Qualities on the right Side of the Que&s;|tion: In a Word "the Virtues of Humanity" which he <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 798.

he re&s;tores the Body of <HI>Hector</HI> to <HI>Priam,</HI> and "the amiable Qualities" which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> tells us <Q>&s;often the terrible Ideas we have conceived of him</Q> are exerci&s;ed too late to wipe off the Stain of his pa&s;t unheroical, and unmanly Beha|viour; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that this Act of Humanity was the Effect of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s expre&s;s Command, delivered by his Mother <HI>Thetis.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, though we cannot but take Notice of a great deal of In&s;olence and Cruelty on both Sides, and are &s;hocked, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> confe&s;&s;es he is, at the many In&s;tances of Inhumanity that oc|cur throughout the Poem, <Q>which however are not to be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 57.

<PB N="370" REF="472">
in which the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 462.</NOTE>amiable Picture of conjugal Love <Q><HI>Homer</HI> has drawn gives us Cau&s;e to think his Genius was no le&s;s capable of touching the Heart with Tenderne&s;s, than of firing it with Glory.</Q> <Q>This Epi&s;ode, (&s;ays that excellent Per&s;on,) tends very much to rai&s;e the Character of <HI>Hector,</HI> and endear him to every Reader,</Q> and indeed we cannot admire this Hero more in the Field, than we love him at Home.

<P>In a Word, you cannot, I believe, but be a Well-wi&s;her to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Priam,</HI> when you con&s;ider the general Character of this good old Man him&s;elf, who&s;e only Fault was his Indulgence to his Children, and e&s;pecially his Piety which "renders him a Favourite of <HI>Jupiter,"</HI> and pro|cures him the Re&s;titution of his Son's Body; or when you look into the Manners of his whole Fa|mily, not even <HI>Helen</HI> excepted, but as &s;he is the Mi&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Paris,</HI> or <HI>Paris</HI> him&s;elf, but as he is the Admirer of that fatal Beauty.

yet how it could give him a Right to call it, or to open it in Con&s;equence of &s;o doing with a formal Speech, I confe&s;s, I can't at all comprehend.&mdash;You will give me Leave ju&s;t to illu&s;trate what I have been ob&s;erving upon this Head, by directing you to a Pa&s;&s;age in the 24th Book, in which <HI>Achilles</HI> at the Height of his Glory, and Popularity among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and at the very In&s;tant that <Q>he promi&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 819.</NOTE><HI>Priam</HI> a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms purely by his own Authority</Q> does neverthele&s;s in Effect acknowledge his Sub|ordination to the Imperial Character, and by his Apprehen&s;ions of the Con&s;equences of the pre&s;ent Proceeding: as if the Poet, even while he is ag|grandizing his Hero, was con&s;cious of a&s;cribing an Importance to him un&s;uitable to the Inferiority of his Station.</P>

<P>You ob&s;erve there is an Incon&s;i&s;tency here which would have been &s;aved had <HI>Achilles</HI> been the <HI>principal</HI> Per&s;on in re&s;pect of Precedence, as well as Valour, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>But it is Time to come to the other Objection, which, as I am not &s;ingular in it, I will give you in the Words of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Note prefixed to the 23d Book of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and endeavour to confirm it by a Remark or two upon what that Expo&s;itor has offered by way of Vindication of his Author. <Q>This, and the following Book, which contain the De&s;cription of the Funeral of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and other Matters relating to <HI>Hector,</HI> are undoubt|edly &s;uper-added to the grand Cata&s;trophe of the Poem; for the Story is compleatly fini&s;hed with the Death of that Hero in the 22d Book. Many judicious Criticks have been of Opinion, that <HI>Homer</HI> is blameable for protracting it. <HI>Virgil</HI> clo&s;es the whole Scene of Action with the Death of <HI>Turnus,</HI> and leaves the re&s;t to be ima|gined by the Mind of the Reader: He does not draw the Picture at full Length, but delineates it &s;o far, that we cannot fail of imagining the whole Draught. There is however one Thing to be &s;aid in Favour of <HI>Homer,</HI> which may perhaps ju&s;tify him in his Method that what he
<PB N="377" REF="479">
undertook to paint was the <HI>Anger</HI> of <HI>Achilles;</HI> and as that Anger does not die with <HI>Hector,</HI> but per&s;ecutes his very Remains, &s;o the Poet &s;till keeps up to his Subject; nay, it &s;eems to require that he &s;hould carry down the Relation of that Re&s;entment, which is the Foundation of his Poem, till it is fully &s;atisfied: And as this &s;urvives <HI>Hector,</HI> and gives the Poet an Oppor|tunity of &s;till &s;hewing many &s;ad Effects of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Anger, the two following Books may be thought not to be Excre&s;cencies, but e&s;&s;en|tial to the Poem.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Virgil</HI> had been inexcu&s;able had he trod in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Foot&s;teps; for it is evident that the Fall of <HI>Turnus,</HI> by giving <HI>Aeneas</HI> a full Power over <HI>Italy,</HI> an&s;wers the whole De&s;ign and Intention of the Poem; had he gone farther he had over|&s;hot his Mark; and though <HI>Homer</HI> proceeds after <HI>Hector</HI>'s Death, yet the Subject is &s;till the <HI>Anger</HI> of <HI>Achilles.</HI></Q> Now, I apprehend, the <HI>Anger</HI> of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which is the <Q>Foundation of the Poem,</Q> is entirely di&s;tinct from that <HI>Anger,</HI> or rather <HI>Revenge</HI> with which he <Q>per&s;ecutes the very Remains of <HI>Hector,</HI></Q> and that the whole declared "De&s;ign and Intention" of the Poet was "to paint the <HI>Anger</HI> of <HI>Achilles"</HI> as the Source of all the Misfortunes the <HI>Grecians</HI> underwent; which were ended by the Reconciliation of that Chief and <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> We <HI>then</HI> &s;ee as plainly the

<P><HI>HOMER</HI> is with much Ju&s;tice to be admired in the main for the agreeable Variety of his Characters, and for the remarkable Spirit, and Uniformity with which each of them is &s;u&s;tained. If he is &s;ometimes faulty upon this Article it is to be a&s;cribed to mere human Infirmity perhaps, or in &s;ome Ca&s;es to that Simplicity which, as has been &s;aid, di&s;tingui&s;hes the <HI>Inventors</HI> of Arts and Sci|ences from the <HI>Improvers</HI> of them. To one of the&s;e it is probably owing that we &s;ee &s;uch a &s;can|dalous Character as that of <HI>Ther&s;ites</HI> in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> or &s;o contemptible a one as that of <HI>Nireus:</HI> The latter, the mo&s;t <HI>beautiful,</HI> the former, the mo&s;t <HI>deformed Per&s;on</HI> of the Poem.

The Caution with which the Courage of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is tempered, &s;ets off the Intrepidity of <HI>Diomed,</HI> and the Activity of <HI>Hector</HI> is finely oppo&s;ed to the <HI>Immobility</HI> of <HI>Ajax;</HI> but the above-mentioned Gentlemen are at be&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary Contra&s;ts to each other, and Foils to every Body el&s;e.&mdash;But that you may not imagine, I am indu&s;triou&s;ly looking after Objections, and <HI>picking</HI> out Characters for the &s;ake of finding Fault, (an Office I abhor) I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to look a little farther into a Character or two of much higher Rank, which you will, I believe, find to be liable to the Objection of not being pre&s;erved with that Nicety of Con&s;i&s;tence, and Uniformity, which is in general &s;o Ob&s;ervable in this noble Writer. If you will judge of the Cha|racter of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> by the Idea which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ju&s;tly gives us of him, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 278. B. iii.</NOTE>who has taken &s;ome Pains to place it in a true Point of View, you will be,
<PB N="381" REF="483">
I make no doubt, of Opinion, that <Q>upon the whole, his Character is by no Means con|temptible, tho' not of the mo&s;t &s;hining Na|ture: He is called indeed in the 17th <HI>Iliad.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, a <HI>&s;oft Warriour,</HI> or one who&s;e Strength is of the &s;econd Rate; and &s;o his Brother thought him when he preferred Nine before him to Fight with <HI>Hector,</HI> in the 7th Book.</Q> Thus far you may &s;afely Sub&s;cribe to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Notion of this Commander; but I am afraid what follows for the Di&s;play of the bright Side of this Character, will cla&s;h rather too much with the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions made to his Di&s;|advantage. For how comes this <HI>&s;oft Warriour</HI> (whom, you know, I have mentioned before in another Light,) to di&s;cover a <Q>Spirit of Revenge which di&s;tingui&s;hes him from <HI>all</HI> the other <HI>Greeks</HI> in the &s;econd Book,</Q> <Q>No <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 711.

<P>If <HI>Homer</HI> meant to &s;hew us hereby that <Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 711.

It may be &s;aid, that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> di&s;&s;uades his brother from the Combat, from a Principle of Brotherly Love, not from any Di&s;tru&s;t of his Courage, of which he appears to have &s;o extraordinary an Opinion in the 4th Book, when <HI>Menelaus</HI> is wounded by <HI>Pandarus,</HI> that he expre&s;&s;es his Apprehen&s;ions, <Q>that the Death of that Hero, will force the <HI>Greeks</HI> to return with &s;hame to their Country.</Q>

But if his Life was of &s;uch Con&s;equence to <HI>Greece,</HI> he &s;hould never have been &s;tiled a <HI>&s;oft Warriour,</HI> or a Chief of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Rate.</P>
<P>I will only point out to what I think rather an Over&s;ight than not in <HI>Homer,</HI> with regard to ano|ther Character, and then quit the pre&s;ent Article of Inquiry; I mean the Character of <HI>Ajax,</HI> whom, not ab&s;olutely, but comparatively &s;peaking, I can't look upon as a proper Per&s;on to be di&s;patched upon the Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Achilles</HI> in the 9th Book. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> however informs us <Q>that the Choice of

<P>THE mo&s;t material Remarks I have farther to make upon the particular Conduct of <HI>Homer,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;hall communicate to you in Order, as the Pa&s;&s;ages which &s;eem exceptionable will occur in the Cour&s;e of the Poem. The fir&s;t that offers it&s;elf is the Interpo&s;ition of <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> in the fir&s;t Book in the Speech wherein he endea|vours to make up the Breach between the con|tending Princes, <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> which, as the De&s;ign of the <HI>Iliad</HI> required it &s;hould be ineffectual, I could wi&s;h he had &s;pared. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 339. B. i.</NOTE> that the Character of Autho|rity

and Wi&s;dom in <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> is every where ad|mirably u&s;ed by <HI>Homer,</HI> and made to exert it|&s;elf through all the great Emergencies of the Poem. As he quiets the Princes here (which how he does we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently) he pro|po&s;es that Expedient which reduces the Army into order, after the Sedition in the &s;econd Book. When the <HI>Greeks</HI> are in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, 'tis he who advi&s;es the Building the Fortification before the Fleet, &amp;c. And 'tis by his Per&s;ua&s;ion that <HI>Patroclus</HI> puts on the Armour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which occa&s;ions the return of that Hero, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> In the&s;e la&s;t mentioned Emergencies, indeed the Authority of this vene|rable Hero has all the Weight you can de&s;ire; but &s;ure in the pre&s;ent In&s;tance, in which if it had prevailed, all future Emergencies had been precluded, it was exerted to no, or at be&s;t, very little Purpo&s;e. The old Man is repre&s;ented as Ma&s;ter of the Art of Per&s;ua&s;ion, and ri&s;es to &s;peak with all the Advantages of the &s;weete&s;t Eloquence, and the Experience of two Generations; and he &s;eems accordingly to promi&s;e him&s;elf Succe&s;s in the Propo&s;al of an Accommodation.</P>

<P>But what Effect, after all, has this Oratory? <Q><HI>Agamemnon</HI> confe&s;&s;es that all he &s;poke was right,</Q> but he will not relinqui&s;h his Preten|&s;ions to <HI>Bri&s;e&iuml;s.</HI> <Q><HI>Achilles</HI> promi&s;es not to fight for <HI>Bri&s;e&iuml;s,</HI></Q> but neither will he for his Country; opprobious Language is given on both Sides; <Q>the Council di&s;&s;olves</Q> and the Calamities of <HI>Greece</HI> en&s;ue. For which Rea&s;ons I think <Q>the Elo|quence of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> is thrown out of Character by its proving unavailable</Q> for the great End he de&s;igned it.&mdash;If he had not &s;poken at all, or upon offering to do it, had been inter|rupted, and prevented by the Fury of <HI>Achilles,</HI> who &s;eems to have le&s;s Veneration for him, than <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> that Hero had acted in Character, and the Eloquence of the reverened Orator had never been exerci&s;ed in vain.</P>
<P>The next Objection I have to make, is again&s;t the imprudent, and unnece&s;&s;ary Mea&s;ure taken by <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> to &s;ound the Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Gre|cians</HI>

might have by his &s;ecret Orders to the Princes.

I don't apprehend that what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has urged from <HI>Dacier,</HI> or advanced him&s;elf, in order to &s;alve this Incon&s;i&s;tency, will afford us &s;ufficient Satisfaction. <Q>We ought to reflect, &s;ays he, that this is only a Prayer: <HI>Hector</HI> in the Exce&s;s of a tender Emotion for his Son, intreats the Gods to pre&s;erve <HI>Troy,</HI> and permit <HI>A&s;tyanax</HI> to rule there.

But to proceed&mdash;The Circum&s;tance of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s weighing in his Scales the Fates of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Troy</HI> in the 8th Book, and tho&s;e of <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> in the 22d, has &s;omething very &s;triking, and poetical in it, but at the &s;ame Time, is it|&s;elf liable to the Objection made by <HI>Macrobius</HI> to <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Imitation of it. <Q><HI>Macrobius,</HI> &s;ays <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 88.

<P>In the Ca&s;e of <HI>Hector, Jupiter</HI> is undeniably explicit; he declares the Fate of that Hero ap|proaching, tho' he is inclined, with the Con&s;ent of the inferiour Deities, to re&s;cue him from it.</P>

<L>(Good as he is) the Lot impos'd on Man?</L>
</LG>
<P>So that <HI>Virgil</HI> appears at lea&s;t not only to have copied this Circum&s;tance from <HI>Homer,</HI> but to have applied it with more Ju&s;tice; for what <HI>Juno</HI> &s;aid previou&s;ly to the Su&s;pen&s;ion of the Scales, is not at lea&s;t &s;o glaring an Impropriety as what <HI>Ju|piter</HI> &s;ays here him&s;elf.

be cleared; and upon which it is no great Wonder if a Poet &s;hould not always be per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, when it has puzzled &s;uch a Number of Divines, and Phi|lo&s;ophers.</Q></P>
<P>Before I quit this Remark, I mu&s;t ju&s;t take Notice of an Over&s;ight in Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> who tells us in his Note <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 88. B. viii.</NOTE>upon the Circum&s;tance of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s weighing the Fates, &amp;c. that <Q>This <HI>Figure</HI> re|pre&s;enting God as weighing the de&s;tinies of Men in his Balances, was fir&s;t made u&s;e of in Holy Writ.</Q> Are the&s;e only <HI>figurative</HI> Scales in <HI>Homer</HI> then? Sure <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> did not look upon them to be &s;uch, when (as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> informs us from <HI>Plutarch)</HI> <Q>he wrote a whole Tragedy upon this Foundation, which he called <HI>P&s;ycho|&s;tatia,</HI> or the <HI>weighing of Souls.</HI> In this he in|troduced <HI>Thetis</HI> and <HI>Aurora</HI> &s;tanding on either Side of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Scales, and praying each for her Son, while the Heroes fought.</Q> I don't &s;ee therefore how any Parallel can rea&s;onably be drawn between this Pa&s;&s;age, which mu&s;t be <HI>lite|rally</HI> under&s;tood in <HI>Homer,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>figurative</HI> Expre&s;&s;ions in <HI>Scripture,</HI> <Q>of <HI>being weighed in the Balance,</HI> and <HI>found light,</HI> &amp;c. by which the Impartiality of divine Ju&s;tice is &s;ignificantly illu&s;trated to the human Under&s;tanding. How

far <HI>Milton</HI> may be warranted in borrowing</Q> this fine Fiction from <HI>Homer,</HI> which it is acknow|ledged "he has admirably improved" or in repre|&s;enting the Deity with a Pair of golden <HI>Compa&s;&s;es</HI> in his Hand upon another Occa&s;ion, it is not my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s to inquire.&mdash;Thus much at lea&s;t may be &s;aid in his Behalf, that <HI>Boldne&s;&s;es</HI> give no Offence when there is no Allay of <HI>Impiety</HI> in them.

B. xx.</NOTE>of the Gods in the 20th Book is an Incident, which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> <Q>wonders all the Commentators &s;hould be &s;ilent upon; it &s;eems &s;trange at the fir&s;t View, &s;ays he, that &s;o many Deities, after having entered the Scene of Ac|tion, &s;hould perform &s;o &s;hort a Part and im|mediately become them&s;elves Spectators.</Q> I mu&s;t indeed look upon this as an Objection to the Conduct of the Poet. Let us hear however what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has urged in his Vindication. He <Q>con|ceives then the Rea&s;on of this Conduct in the Poet to be, that <HI>Achilles</HI> has been inactive dur|ing the greate&s;t Part of the Poem; and as he
<PB N="399" REF="501">
is the Hero of it, ought to be the chief Cha|racter in it: The Poet therefore withdraws the Gods from the Field, that <HI>Achilles</HI> may have the whole Honour of the Day, and not act in Subordination to the Deities; be&s;ides the Poem now draws to a Conclu&s;ion, and it is nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>Homer</HI> to enlarge upon the Exploits of <HI>Achilles,</HI> that he may leave a noble Idea of his Valour upon the Mind of the Reader.</Q></P>
<P>Now I would take the Liberty to a&s;k, whether it be derogatory to the important Character of <HI>Achilles</HI> to act in Subordination to the Deities? Whether their Superintendency and A&s;&s;i&s;tance has not been an Honour to every Hero in the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> particularly to <HI>Diomed</HI> in the fifth Book? Whether <HI>Achilles</HI> him&s;elf makes &s;o great a Figure in this Book as he does in the next when <Q><HI>Scamander</HI> attacks him with all his Waves; when <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Pallas</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See L. 330. B. xxi.</NOTE>appear to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: <HI>Simois</HI> joins <HI>Scamander,</HI> and at length <HI>Vulcan,</HI> by the In&s;tigation of <HI>Juno,</HI> almo&s;t dries up the River.</Q> Does the Interpo&s;ition of the&s;e Deities do a Di&s;credit to the Valour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> or <Q>leave a le&s;s noble Idea of it upon the Mind of the Reader</Q> than he would have had without it?&mdash;I dare &s;ay you will agree with me that what Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> ob&s;erves in the next Note is a kind of An|&s;wer to what he has advanced in this, and be
<PB N="400" REF="502">
convinced that the <Q>magnificent Introduction of <HI>Achilles</HI> into the Field in the Beginning of this Book, when the Gods de&s;cend to Battle, and all Nature is in an Uproar, is not an&s;wered by any &s;uitable Exploits of that Hero, or by any Atchievement worthy &s;o pompous, and terrible an <HI>Apparatus!</HI> After the Gods are withdrawn, <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> meet; but in the very Mo|ment, you expect to &s;ee a bloody Combat, you are entertained with a tedious Conver&s;ation.</Q> Take Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s own Words.&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 214.

<P>But to return to the Deities. The magnificent Introduction of the Gods above referred to, &s;o much extolled by <HI>Longinus,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 75.

<PB N="404" REF="506">
Gods: When <HI>Diana</HI> and <HI>Juno</HI> are to fight, <HI>Juno</HI> calls her an <HI>impudent Bitch,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">; when they fight, &s;he boxes her &s;oundly, and &s;ends her crying and trembling to Heav'n: As &s;oon as &s;he comes thither, <HI>Jupiter</HI> falls a laughing at her: Indeed the re&s;t of the Deities &s;eem to be in a merry Vein during all the Action; (tho' Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;hould have excepted <HI>Neptune,</HI> and <HI>Apollo,</HI> from the fir&s;t of which Gods we have another Piece of <HI>antient Hi&s;tory;) Pallas</HI> beats <HI>Mars,</HI> and laughs at him; <HI>Jupiter</HI> &s;ees them in the &s;ame merry Mood; <HI>Juno</HI> when &s;he had cuffed <HI>Diana,</HI> is not more &s;erious: In &s;hort un|le&s;s there be Depths that I am not able to Fathom, <HI>Homer</HI> never better de&s;erved, than in this Place, the Cen&s;ure pa&s;t upon him by the Antients, that as he rai&s;ed the Characters of his Men up to Gods, &s;o he &s;unk tho&s;e of Gods down to Men,</Q> or even below them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is willing to believe, however, that an <HI>Allegory</HI> may be couched under all this, and I wi&s;h any Body could di&s;cover it: In the mean Time I can't but ob&s;erve, that 'tis great Pity the Gods and Godde&s;&s;es that often appear &s;o nobly in &s;eparate <HI>Machines</HI> throughout the <HI>Iliad,</HI> &s;hould make &s;o mean a Figure in the pre&s;ent Battle.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t reque&s;t your Attention to one Incident more, which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> would fain reconcile us to, viz. the Flight of <HI>Hector</HI> in the 22d Book. I ap|prehend
<PB N="405" REF="507">
that what that Commentator alledges from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 180. B. xxii.</NOTE>Conduct of <HI>Virgil,</HI> <Q>who transferred this Pa&s;&s;age to the Death of <HI>Turnus,</HI></Q> and likewi&s;e from the Doctrine of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> is extremely in&s;uffi|cient for his Purpo&s;e. <HI>Turnus</HI> is a Character much inferiour to <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and therefore we are little &s;hocked at his running away from him. But this is confe&s;&s;edly not the Ca&s;e, the Point of mere Strength excepted, with <HI>Hector</HI> when compared to <HI>Achilles.</HI> It was, you'll &s;ay, that very Strength which he feared&mdash;was it not, that very Strength too, which he had frequently encountered? And if it was not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> he <HI>&s;hould</HI> fly; I will venture to &s;ay it is a Circum&s;tance infinitely <HI>di&s;agreeable</HI> to the Reader, that he <HI>does.</HI></P>
<P>Nor farther is "the Suffrage of <HI>Ari&s;totle"</HI> him&s;elf, if I under&s;tand it at all, &s;atisfactory upon this Point. <Q>The <HI>wonderful,</HI> &s;ays he, ought to have Place in Tragedy, but &s;till more in Epic Poetry, which proceeds in this Point even to the <HI>unrea&s;onable:</HI> For as in Epic Poems one &s;ees not the Per&s;ons acting, &s;o whatever <HI>pa&s;&s;es the Bounds of Rea&s;on,</HI> is proper to Produce the <HI>ad|mirable</HI> and the <HI>marvellous.</HI> For Example, what <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Hector</HI> pur&s;ued by <HI>Achilles,</HI> would appear ridiculous on the Stage; for the Spectators could not forbear laughing to &s;ee on

one Side the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;tanding without any Mo|tion, and on the other, <HI>Achilles</HI> pur&s;uing <HI>Hector</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. But all this does not appear when we read the Poem; for what is <HI>wonderful,</HI> is always <HI>agreeable,</HI> and as a Proof of it, we find that they who relate any Thing, u&s;ually add &s;omething to the Truth, that it may the better plea&s;e tho&s;e who hear it.</Q></P>
<P>What can we infer from all this, but that the Flight of <HI>Hector</HI> round the Walls of <HI>Troy,</HI> is an <HI>Action,</HI> which, as <HI>&s;uch,</HI> will much better bear being <HI>told,</HI> than repre&s;ented? No doubt of it&mdash;but is an Action, all this while, which is <HI>unrea|&s;onable</HI> in it&s;elf, <HI>therefore agreeable, becau&s;e</HI> it may be <HI>told</HI> with Propriety? Do we never <HI>wonder</HI> with|out <HI>admiring,</HI> or <HI>marvel</HI> with <HI>Di&s;gu&s;t,</HI> as well as <HI>Delight?</HI> I <HI>will grant</HI> this Incident renders this Part of the Poem more <HI>a&s;toni&s;hing,</HI> as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;ays in a &s;ub&s;equent Paragraph of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Note; but why it is more <HI>admirable,</HI> I am quite at a lo&s;s to conceive.</P>
<P>What Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> urges him&s;elf in Vindication of this Circum&s;tance, has much more Weight in it; as <Q>that <HI>Hector</HI> never thought him&s;elf a Match for <HI>Achilles;</HI> that this Incident is pre|pared by Degrees, as <HI>Dacier</HI> has ob&s;erved too; that, the mere Sight and Voice of <HI>Achilles</HI> un|armed, has terrified and put the whole <HI>Trojan</HI> Army into Di&s;order: That <HI>Hector</HI> &s;tays, not that
<PB N="407" REF="509">
he Hopes to overcome <HI>Achilles,</HI> but becau&s;e, Shame, &amp;c. forbid him to re-enter the City; that he &s;tayed by the immediate <HI>Will of Hea|ven,</HI> irre&s;i&s;tibly bound down by Fate: That he had been reflecting on the Inju&s;tice of the War he maintained; that his Spirits are depre&s;&s;ed by Heaven: That he flies not from <HI>Achilles</HI> as a mortal Hero, but from one whom he &s;ees clad in impenetrable Armour, &s;econded by <HI>Mi|nerva,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> which Con&s;iderations do in|deed amount to a Proof of the <HI>Probability</HI> of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Flight, but, I think, are no Argument for the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of it.

<P>I can't think, by the way, that it is <Q>a high Exaltation of <HI>Achilles,</HI> that &s;o brave a Man as <HI>Hector</HI> dur&s;t not <HI>&s;tand him.</HI></Q> It would methinks have redounded more to <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Glory, had <HI>Hec|tor</HI> been repre&s;ented as a <HI>Match</HI> for him. Indeed <Q>this great Event, wherein the whole Fate of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Troy</HI> was decided by the Sword of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and <HI>Hector,</HI></Q> does le&s;s Honour to that Hero than any one Action he had been engaged in, for the la&s;t of the above Rea&s;ons alledged for <HI>Hector</HI>'s Flight, and be&s;au&s;e <Q>he <HI>knew</HI> that <HI>Hector</HI> was to fall by his Hand.</Q> He was a&s;&s;ured of this by <HI>Neptune,</HI> and <HI>Pallas</HI> in the 21&s;t.

<P>IF you con&s;ider the <HI>Iliad</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> with any thing of exactne&s;s of Attention, you will per|ceive numberle&s;s Marks of a Genius, thoughtle&s;s of, or, it may be, &s;uperiour to the Niceties, and Proprieties in which the Excellencies of &s;econd-rate Authors wholly con&s;i&s;t. To what has been offered already for the Illu&s;tration of this Truth you may add, if you plea&s;e, the <HI>Repetitions</HI> with which <HI>Homer</HI> &s;o much abounds. I am far from a&s;&s;erting that the&s;e are never proper, tho' they are often, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> confe&s;&s;es, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 570. B. viii.</NOTE>vi&s;ibly ab&s;urd. I will only point out one Place, where it is owing to a <HI>Repetition,</HI> that the very De&s;ign of the Author cannot ea&s;ily be under&s;tood: I mean the Speech of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in the 9th Book, wherein he propo&s;es to the Generals to quit the Siege, &amp;c. <Q>The Cri|ticks <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Note at L. 23. B. ix.</NOTE>are divided in their Opinion, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> acquaints us, whether this Speech, which is Word for Word the &s;ame with that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> makes in the 2d Book, be only a Feint to try the Army, as it is there, or the real Sentiments of the General.</Q> Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ays, <Q>He does not pretend to decide upon this Point</Q> nor is it in|deed of any great Con&s;equence, any farther than as it makes good what has been remarked; however that <HI>Agamemnon</HI> upon this Occa&s;ion &s;poke his real Sentiments is, I think mo&s;t probable, becau&s;e upon a Parallel one in the 14th Book, he propo&s;es the very

<P>Again, it is in my Opinion more rea&s;onable to put the frequent <HI>Incongruities</HI> we meet with in <HI>Homer</HI> to the Account of Inadvertency, &amp;c. than to reconcile them by forced and unnatural Con|&s;tructions.

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>IN my former Letters I endeavoured to enter|tain you with &s;ome free, but, I hope, ju&s;t Remarks upon Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Commentaries upon <HI>Homer.</HI> If you plea&s;e we will now take a &s;hort Review of that excellent Per&s;on's <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> of the &s;ame incomparable Author. I mu&s;t once more prevent your Surprize, and perhaps your In|dignation, by declaring that I agree with all the World in allowing this to be, in the main, the be&s;t <HI>Tran&s;lation,</HI> that our, or it may be, any Language has produced. If I think we might have had a better <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> in &s;ome few Re&s;pects, I only mean that we might have had it from Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>
<PB N="415" REF="517">
him&s;elf. Nay, I will go a Step further, and grant you with much Satisfaction that this celebrated <HI>Tran&s;lator</HI> always errs on the right Side, and even when he does not do his Reader <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> never fails to do <HI>Honour</HI> to his <HI>Original:</HI> I &s;hould rather &s;ay, to <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> for if Boldne&s;s of Figure, Force of Expre&s;&s;ion, Smoothne&s;s and Ea&s;e of Numbers, and the Corre&s;pondence of Sound with Sen&s;e, be the great Beauties of poetical Diction, I &s;hould make no Scruple, upon the whole, to prefer the <HI>Engli&s;h Iliad,</HI> to the <HI>Greek.</HI> But the&s;e very Excel|lencies are in &s;ome Sort his Errors, and what I admire in this <HI>Poem,</HI> I can't help often con&s;ider|ing as blameable in the <HI>Tran&s;lation.</HI> In &s;hort, it is the <HI>Over-poeticalne&s;s</HI> of this <HI>Tran&s;lation,</HI> if I may &s;o call it, which I take to be exceptionable in many Place. And yet, as there was no Dan|ger of &s;o naturally a warm <HI>Tran&s;lator</HI>'s &s;inking into Flatne&s;s, and In&s;ipidity, &s;o one would have thought he had laid him&s;elf under Re&s;traints &s;uffi|cient to have prevented his ever &s;oaring into the other Extreme of Rapture, and Extravagance.&mdash;There is not more <HI>Fire</HI> in any one Part of the <HI>Tran&s;lation,</HI> than there is good Sen&s;e and cool Rea&s;oning in the following Extract from the <HI>Preface.</HI> <Q>It &s;hould be con&s;idered what Me|thods may afford &s;ome Equivalent in our Lan|guage for the Graces of the&s;e (viz. the <HI>Diction</HI> and <HI>Ver&s;ification)</HI> in the <HI>Greek.</HI> It is certain
<PB N="416" REF="518">
no literal Tran&s;lation can be ju&s;t to an excel|lent Original in a &s;uperior Language; but it is a great Mi&s;take to imagine that a ra&s;h Para|phra&s;e can make Amends for this general De|fect; which is no le&s;s in Danger to lo&s;e the Spirit of an Ancient, by deviating into the modern Manners of Expre&s;&s;ion. If there be &s;ometimes a Darkne&s;s, there is often a Light in Antiquity, which nothing better pre&s;erves than a Ver&s;ion almo&s;t literal. I know no Li|berties one ought to take, but tho&s;e which are nece&s;&s;ary for tran&s;lating the Spirit of the Ori|ginal, and &s;upporting the poetical Style of the Tran&s;lation: And I will venture to &s;ay, there have not been more Men mi&s;led in former Times by a &s;ervile dull Adherence to the Letter, than have been deluded in ours, by a chime|rical in&s;olent Hope of rai&s;ing and improving their Author. It is not to be doubted that the <HI>Fire</HI> of the Poem is what a Tran&s;lator &s;hould principally regard, as it is mo&s;t likely to expire in his managing: However it is his &s;afe&s;t Way to be content with pre&s;erving this to his utmo&s;t in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his Author is, in any particular Place. 'Tis a great Secret in writing to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figu|rative; and it is what <HI>Homer</HI> will teach us, if we will but follow mode&s;tly in his Foot&s;teps.
<PB N="417" REF="519">
Where his Diction is bold and lofty, let us rai&s;e ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be de|terred from imitating him by the fear of incur|ring the Cen&s;ure of a mere <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Critick. Nothing that belongs to <HI>Homer</HI> &s;eems to have been more commonly mi&s;taken than the ju&s;t Pitch of his Style; &s;ome of his Tran&s;lators ha|ving &s;welled into Fu&s;tian in a proud Confidence of the <HI>Sublime:</HI> Others &s;unk into Flatne&s;s in a cold and timorous Notion of <HI>Simplicity.</HI>&mdash;There is a graceful, and dignified Simplicity, as well as a bald and &s;ordid one, &amp;c.&mdash;'Tis one Thing to be nicked up, and another not to be dre&s;&s;ed at all. Simplicity is the mien between O&s;tentation and Ru&s;ticity.</Q></P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> had always conducted his Tran&s;la|tion conformably to the&s;e ju&s;t Sentiments, it would have been the mo&s;t <HI>exact,</HI> as it is now the mo&s;t <HI>Spirited</HI> one extant: But, I believe, you will by and by be convinced that he has often <HI>modernized</HI> his Original too much, and &s;acrificed the true Simplicity of the Antients in general, and the par|ticular Air, and Ca&s;t of his Author, either to an Exce&s;s of Affection for him, and De&s;ire to &s;et his Work in the mo&s;t advantageous Light to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Reader, or to an undue Fear of le&s;&s;ening and injuring him thro' the Inferiority of our Lan|guage to the <HI>Grecian</HI> in many Re&s;pects. To one or
<PB N="418" REF="520">
both of tho&s;e we are indebted, I pre&s;ume, for many bold Strokes of Poetry, and fine Pieces of Paint|ing, and Imagery, which are not &s;o much Copies of, as Refinements on, the Original.</P>
<P>And, by the Way, it may be remarked that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;hould have been more than ordinarily cautious upon this Article, as he was under an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>&s;inking</HI> &s;ome Peculiarities in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Diction, which would not bear Tran&s;|planting into our <HI>Tongue.</HI> Such are his <HI>compound Epithets,</HI> and <HI>Repetitions.</HI> How our <HI>Tran&s;lator</HI> has acquitted him&s;elf with regard to the&s;e, you will be be&s;t informed by con&s;ulting him&s;elf. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Homer.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>It is however to be ob&s;erved in general, that every Thing <HI>characteri&s;tical</HI> in an Author, is, as far as may be, to be mo&s;t religiou&s;ly retained; and that, notwith&s;tanding the allowed occa&s;ional U&s;e of the <HI>Periphra&s;is,</HI> or <HI>Circumlocution,</HI> the <HI>Tran&s;|po&s;ition</HI> of Words, and the <HI>Sub&s;titution</HI> of one Ex|pre&s;&s;ion in the Room of another, &amp;c. &amp;c. by Means of which the Spirit of an Original is pre|&s;erved without Prejudice to the literal Sen&s;e, all imaginable Care is to be taken that the&s;e Liber|ties under the Pretence of maintaining and &s;up|porting this Spirit, do not really over-power, and extingui&s;h it. <HI>Redundancies</HI> are as <HI>unoriginal</HI> as <HI>In&s;ipidities,</HI> and the Spirit of an Author may be
<PB N="419" REF="521">
as much overwhelmed in Exuberance on the one Hand, as it evaporates in Frigidity on the other.&mdash;<HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Water</HI> are &s;carce more oppo&s;ite than Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and that of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> by Dr. <HI>Trapp;</HI> I am apt to think we &s;hall often form very wrong Ideas of the&s;e Poems if we regulate them by the&s;e re&s;pective Tran&s;la|tions; for Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;eems to have exalted the true Simplicity of <HI>Homer,</HI> as "graceful and dignified" as it is, in the &s;ame Degree that the <HI>Doctor</HI> has deba&s;ed the Maje&s;ty of <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>You will begin to think it high Time I &s;hould make good this Charge, which I &s;hall accordingly endeavour to do by pointing to a few &s;elect Pa&s;|&s;ages out of Numbers that might be produced, in which you will plainly di&s;cover certain <HI>Bold|ne&s;&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Prettyne&s;&s;es,</HI> (for you mu&s;t gratify me in the U&s;e of that Term for them) and very fre|quently a Mixture of both, that were taken from the Store-hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s own Imagination, and are utterly foreign to, and de&s;tructive of, the plain Scope, and unaffected Spirit of his Author.</P>
<P>There is not perhaps in all the <HI>Iliad</HI> a more pompous De&s;cription than that of <HI>Achilles</HI> arming him&s;elf in the 19th Book. The Compari&s;ons, and Images, (as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> well ob&s;erves) <Q>ri&s;e in a noble Scale one above another; the Hero is &s;et in a &s;till &s;tronger Point of Light than before, till he is at la&s;t in a Manner covered over with
<PB N="420" REF="522">
Glories; he is at fir&s;t likened to the Moonlight, then to the Flames of a Beacon, then to a Comet, and la&s;tly to the Sun it&s;elf.</Q> But with all this Sublimity, and almo&s;t <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> there is a Simplicity which is, I conceive, lo&s;t in that Exaggeration of Imagery with which the Tran&s;|lator has embeli&s;hed the Pa&s;&s;age. The whole De&s;cription, which is too long to be tran&s;cribed, is rather loo&s;ely paraphra&s;ed perhaps than other|wi&s;e, but the Parts I have marked are &s;o many beautiful Excre&s;cencies, which have no Sort of Warrant from the Letter, or mo&s;t of them even from the Import of the Text.</P>

Dr. <HI>Trapp</HI> ob&s;erves, I think, very ju&s;tly in his <HI>Preface</HI> to the Aeneid, that <Q>blank Ver&s;e is not only more maje&s;tic &amp;c. but more mu&s;ical and harmonious than Rhime: It has, &s;ays he, more <HI>Rhime</HI> in it according to the ancient and true Sen&s;e of the Word, than
<PB N="431" REF="533">
<HI>Rhime</HI> it&s;elf as it is now u&s;ed. For, in its ori|ginal Signification, it con&s;i&s;ts not in the tinkling of Vowels and Con&s;onants, but in the metrical Di&s;po&s;ition of Words and Syllables, and the proper Cadence of Numbers; which is more agreeable to the Ear, without the jingling of like Endings than with it.</Q>&mdash;After all, the <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI> in <HI>blank</HI> Ver&s;e does <HI>really</HI> and &s;pecifi|cally di&s;tingui&s;h it from <HI>mere</HI> Pro&s;e; and if &s;o, <HI>Rhime</HI> is not wanted for this Purpo&s;e. Nor can it be pretended that the &s;trong <HI>Colours</HI> of Poetry, the Beauties of De&s;cription, Figures, Images, &amp;c. &amp;c. are capable of being di&s;played to more Advantage in <HI>Rhime,</HI> than in <HI>blank</HI> Ver&s;e.&mdash;Indeed <HI>the&s;e</HI> are not peculiar even to Poetry; they are independent on <HI>Metre,</HI> and de|rive not Energy or Strength, but Gracefulne&s;s only and Dignity from <HI>Numbers.</HI>&mdash;They are <HI>fitter</HI> for <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> than <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> but not more <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to it.&mdash;Thus the bold <HI>Figures, Similies,</HI> and <HI>Thoughts,</HI> &amp;c. of <HI>Homer</HI> would be of the &s;ame intrin&s;ic Va|lue out of <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> as in it;&mdash;as the Holy Scrip|tures, by the way, though literally tran&s;lated in plain <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> are in numberle&s;s In&s;tances <HI>poetical,</HI> though they are by no means a <HI>Poem.</HI>&mdash;It is not for the &s;ake of <HI>Lu&s;tre,</HI> but <HI>Order,</HI> that Diamonds and Pearls are ranged upon a String.&mdash;But to re|turn to Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI>&mdash;Whatever Credit his <HI>Tran&s;la|tion</HI> may have done the Original by heightening

<PB N="434" REF="536">
it can, I think, render it di&s;pen&s;able in an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Ver&s;ion.&mdash;Now <HI>convenient</HI> it may &s;ometimes be, but it is never <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI>&mdash;Whatever are the Imperfections, and Defects of our Language, they are, it is my Opinion, &s;uch, as <HI>Rhime,</HI> tho' it may <HI>di&s;gui&s;e,</HI> can never <HI>&s;upply.</HI> But I would ex|clude <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> from <HI>Poetry,</HI> as well as <HI>Religion,</HI> and confe&s;s for my own Part, that I had much rather &s;ee a <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> in <HI>&s;ome</HI> Places <HI>inferior</HI> to its Original, than unlike it in <HI>all.</HI> If upon the <HI>whole</HI> not only the very <HI>Ca&s;t,</HI> but the Sen&s;e and Spirit of an Author may be better pre&s;erved in <HI>blank</HI> Ver&s;e than <HI>Rhime,</HI> every rea&s;onable Critic will make Allowances for the Poverty, and natu|ral Inferiority of our Mother Tongue. Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI>'s Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> is a very noble one; tho' I cannot conceive what induced him to give it us in <HI>Rhime,</HI> unle&s;s it was the Appre|hen&s;ion of the Inequality of our Language to the Diction of his Author where it is mo&s;t plain, and unpoetical. Indeed <HI>Purity,</HI> and <HI>Man|line&s;s</HI> are the chief <HI>Characteri&s;tics</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> as <HI>Fire,</HI> and <HI>Vivacity</HI> are tho&s;e of <HI>Homer;</HI> for which Rea&s;on I &s;hould imagine the latter a more <HI>attemptable</HI> Author, than the former, if Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> had not precluded every Under|taking of this Nature, even tho' he wrote in <HI>Rhime.</HI> For bold <HI>Figures,</HI> &s;trong <HI>Paintings,</HI> and beauti|ful <HI>Colourings</HI> may be ransfu&s;ed from one Lan|guage

to another: but <HI>Purity, Simplicity,</HI> and <HI>Elegance,</HI> tho' they are the &s;ame things in all Tongues, are not equally &s;triking in them all.&mdash;However, no <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> can go farther than the <HI>Genius</HI> of our Language will admit; and even with regard to <HI>Virgil,</HI> it will go, I am inclined to believe, far enough to convey a <HI>&s;trong</HI> Idea of this noble Original in <HI>all</HI> its Parts. It will go farther at lea&s;t without <HI>Rhime,</HI> than with it. Dr. <HI>Trapp</HI> indeed, than whom no Body better <HI>under|&s;tood</HI> his Author, by too &s;uper&s;titious an Adherence to the <HI>Letter,</HI> and particularly a fruitle&s;s and per|petual Endeavour to retain the <HI>Brevity</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> is cold and languid upon numberle&s;s Occa&s;ions; and has thereby perhaps contributed more to the Di&s;reputation of <HI>blank</HI> Ver&s;e, than any other Wri|ter. He was offended, and not without Rea&s;on, with the <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Tran&s;la|tion; but his <HI>&s;queami&s;hne&s;s</HI> has carried him into the other Extreme; for if Mr. <HI>Dryden runs away</HI> from <HI>Virgil,</HI> the <HI>Doctor</HI> is <HI>tied to him.</HI>&mdash;There is, by the by, this ob&s;ervable Difference, between Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Deviations from <HI>Virgil,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s from <HI>Homer,</HI> that tho&s;e of the latter are always uniform, graceful, and beautiful, and if they are not <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Thoughts</HI> are at lea&s;t <HI>worthy</HI> of him; whereas Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> is apt to dwindle into a kind of <HI>Puerility,</HI> which was but too na|tural to him, that is altogether un&s;uitable to the
