<SPEAKER>SHARP.</SPEAKER>
<P>_HOW, Sir! &s;hall you be married To-morrow? Eh, I'm afraid you joke with your poor hum|ble Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell thee, <HI>Sharp,</HI> la&s;t Night <HI>Meli&s;&s;a</HI> con&s;ented, and fixed to-morrow for the happy Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis well &s;he did, Sir, or it might have been a dreadful one for us in our pre&s;ent Condition: All your Money &s;pent; your Move|ables &s;old; your Honour almo&s;t ruined, and your humble Servant almo&s;t &s;tarved; we could not po&s;&s;ibly have &s;tood it two Days longer&mdash;But if this young Lady will marry you and re|lieve us, o'my Con&s;cience I'll turn Friend to the Sex, rail no more at Matrimony, but cur&s;e the Whores, and think of a Wife my&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, <HI>Sharp,</HI> when I think how I have impo&s;ed upon her, I am almo&s;t re&s;olv'd to throw my&s;elf at her Feet, tell her the real Situation of my Affairs, a&s;k her Pardon, and implore her Pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>After Marriage with all my Heart, Sir; but don't let your Con&s;cience and Honour &s;o far get the better of your Poverty and good Sen&s;e, as to rely on &s;o great Uncertainties as a fine Lady's Mercy and Good-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know her generous Temper, and am almo&s;t per&s;uaded to rely upon it: What, be|cau&s;e I am poor, &s;hall I abandon my Honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you mu&s;t, Sir, or abandon me: So, pray, di&s;charge one of us; for eat I mu&s;t, and &s;peedily too: and you know very well that that Honour of yours, will neither intro|duce you to a great Man's Table, nor get me Credit for a &s;ingle Beef-Steak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, while Honour &s;ticks in
<PB N="3" REF="6">
your Throat: do gulp, Ma&s;ter, and down with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee leave me to my Thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave you! No, not in &s;uch bad Com|pany, I'll a&s;&s;ure you! Why you mu&s;t certainly be a very great Philo&s;opher, Sir, to moralize and declaim &s;o charmingly, as you do, about Honour and Con&s;cience, when your Doors are be&s;et with Bailiffs, and not one &s;ingle Guinea in your Pocket to bribe the Villains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be witty, and give your Advice, Sirrah!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you be wi&s;e, and take it, Sir. But to be &s;erious, you certainly have &s;pent your Fortune, and out-liv'd your Credit, as your Pockets and my Belly can te&s;tify: Your Father has di&s;own'd you; all your Friends for|&s;ook you, except my&s;elf, who am &s;tarving with you. Now, Sir, if you marry this young Lady, who as yet, thank Heaven, knows nothing of your Misfortunes, and by that means procure a better Fortune than that you &s;quander'd a|way, make a good Hu&s;band, and turn Oecono|mi&s;t; you &s;till may be happy, may &s;till be Sir <HI>William</HI>'s Heir, and the Lady too no Lofer by the Bargain: There's Rea&s;on and Argument, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas with that Pro&s;pect I fir&s;t made Love to her; and though my Fortune has been ill &s;pent, I have, at lea&s;t, purcha&s;ed Di&s;cretion with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray then convince me of that, Sir, and make no more Objections to the Marriage: You &s;ee I am reduced to my Wai&s;tcoat alrea|dy; and when Nece&s;&s;ity has undre&s;s'd me from Top to Toe, &s;he mu&s;t begin with you; and then we &s;hall be forced to keep Hou&s;e and die by Inches. Look you, Sir, if you won't re|&s;olve to take my Advice, while you have one Coat to your Back, I mu&s;t e'en take to my Heels while I have Strength to run, and &s;ome|thing to cover me: So, Sir, wi&s;hing you much Comfort and Con&s;olation with your bare Con|&s;cience, I am your mo&s;t obedient and half|&s;tarv'd Friend and Servant <STAGE>[Going.</STAGE></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t eat, Sir; by my Honour and Appetite I mu&s;t!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I am re&s;olv'd to favour the Cheat, and as I &s;hall quite change my former Cour&s;e of Life, happy may be the Con&s;e|quences: at lea&s;t of this I am &s;ure&mdash;</P>

<P>Some of your former good Friends, who favour'd you with Money at fifty <HI>per Cent.,</HI> and helped you to &s;pend it; and are now become daily Memento's to you of the Folly of tru&s;ting Rogues, following Whores, and laughing at my Advice.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cea&s;e your Impertinence! to the Door! if they are Duns, tell 'em my Marriage is now certainly fix'd, and per&s;uade em &s;till to forbear a few Days longer, and keep my Circum&s;tances a Secret for their Sakes as well as my own.</P>

<P>O never fear it, Sir; they &s;till have &s;o much Friend&s;hip for you, not to de&s;ire your Ruin to their own Di&s;advantage.</P>

<P>I'll obey you, Sir;&mdash;but I am afraid they will ea&s;ily di&s;cover the con&s;umptive Si|tuation of our Affairs by my chop-fallen Coun|tenance. <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Sharp.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e very Ra&s;cals who are now con|tinually dunning and per&s;ecuting me, were the very Per&s;ons who led me to my Ruin, par|took of my Pro&s;perity, and profe&s;s'd the greate&s;t Friend&s;hip.</P>
