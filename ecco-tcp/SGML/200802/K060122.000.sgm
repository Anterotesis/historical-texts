<P>AN ESSAY UPON Publick Credit:</P>
<P>BEING An ENQUIRY How the PUBLICK CREDIT comes to depend upon the Change of the <HI>Mi|ni&s;try,</HI> or the Di&s;&s;olutions of <HI>Parliaments</HI>; and whether it does &s;o or no.</P>
<P>With an ARGUMENT, Proving that the PUBLICK CREDIT may be upheld and maintain'd in this Nation; and perhaps brought to a grea|ter Height than it ever yet arriv'd at; Tho' all the Changes or Di&s;&s;olutions al|ready Made, Pretended to, and now Di&s;cours'd of, &s;hou'd come to pa&s;s in the World.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY UPON <HI>Publick Credit,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE World being &s;o full of Polititians, and &s;o ma|ny Authors having of late turn'd State&s;men, it be|hoves me to lay every Thing down exceeding plain, as I go on; The Subject is nice, the Age abu&s;ive, the Town full of <HI>Ob&s;ervers</HI> and <HI>Reviewers,</HI> who Write to plea&s;e and content the No|tions of Men, who, directed by their In|tere&s;t and Parties, differ even with them|&s;elves; Rea&s;on, it is true, is DICTATOR in the Society of Mankind; from her there ought to lye no Appeal; But here we want a Pope in our Philo&s;ophy, to be the infallible Judge of what <HI>is</HI> or<HI>is not</HI> Rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">
I am to &s;peak of what all People are bu&s;ie about, but not one in Forty under|&s;tands: Every Man has a Concern in it, few know what it is, nor is it ea&s;y to de|fine or de&s;cribe it. If a Man goes about to explain it by Words, he rather &s;truggles to lo&s;e him&s;elf <HI>in the Wood,</HI> than bring o|thers out of it. It is be&s;t de&s;crib'd by it &s;elf; 'tis like the Wind that blows <HI>where it li&s;ts,</HI> we hear the <HI>&s;ound</HI> thereof, but hardly know <HI>whence it comes,</HI> or <HI>whither it goes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Like the Soul</HI> in the Body, it acts all Sub&s;tance, yet is it &s;elf Immaterial; it gives Motion, yet it &s;elf cannot be &s;aid to Exi&s;t; it creates <HI>Forms,</HI> yet has it &s;elf <HI>no Form;</HI> it is neither Quantity or Quali|ty; it has no <HI>Wherene&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Whenne&s;s, Scite,</HI> or <HI>Habit.</HI> If I &s;hould &s;ay it is the e&s;&s;en|tial Shadow of &s;omething that is Not; &s;hould I not Puzzle the thing rather than Explain it, and leave you and my &s;elf more the Dark than we were before?</P>
<P>To come a at direct and clear Under|&s;tanding of the Thing, the be&s;t Me|thod will be to de&s;cribe its <HI>Operations,</HI> rather than define its <HI>Nature;</HI> to &s;how <HI>how it Acts</HI> rather than <HI>how it Exi&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>what it does,</HI> rather than <HI>what it is.</HI></P>
<P>TRADE, as the Author of the <HI>Re|view</HI> has told us, and who I can better &s;ubmit to learn of on that &s;ubject, than
<PB N="7" REF="5">
&s;ome other he talks more about <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was derived by Convenience from the profitable exchanging of Goods from Nation to Nation, and from Place to Place, as People encrea&s;ing, found their Neighbours po&s;&s;e&s;t of what they wan|ted, and them&s;elves having to &s;pare of what their Neighbouring Countries did not produce."</Q> <HI>This we now call Barter,</HI> and is not &s;o much in U&s;e as it was in the Infancy of Commerce in the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brittains</HI> Inhabiting this I&s;land were found to Exchange their <HI>Block Tin</HI> with the <HI>Phenecian</HI> Merchants for <HI>Spices, Wines</HI> and <HI>Oyls,</HI> even long before <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;et his Foot upon this I&s;land.</P>
<P>But as Trade increa&s;ed, two Accidents <HI>fell in,</HI> as Effects; being the great <HI>Medi|ums</HI> of Univer&s;al Commerce, <HI>the Vehicle</HI> in which Trade is Pre&s;erv'd or Admini|&s;tred thro' the World; the&s;e were <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Credit.</HI></P>
<P>This thing call'd Commerce flouri&s;h|ing, and extending every way into all the Corners of the World, the Nations fall|ing generally into Dealing with one ano|ther; yet Trade found it &s;elf un&s;uffera|bly &s;treightned and perplext for want of a General <HI>Species</HI> of a compleat intrin&s;ick Worth, <HI>as the Medium</HI> to &s;upply the de|fect of Exchanging, and to make good <HI>the Balance&punc;</HI> where a Nation, or a Mar|ket,
<PB N="8" REF="6">
or a Merchant, demanded of ano|ther a greater quantity of Goods than ei|ther the Buyer had Goods <HI>to An&s;wer,</HI> or the Seller had occa&s;ion to <HI>take back.</HI></P>
<P>This nothing could be found in the World of univer&s;al and intrin&s;ick Worth enough to An&s;wer, but <HI>Metals;</HI> as being neither con&s;uming in <HI>Quality,</HI> bulky in <HI>Carriage,</HI> or u&s;ele&s;s in <HI>Nature:</HI> Of the&s;e Metals &s;everal Nations adhered a long time, to &s;uch as their own Country pro|duced; but <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver,</HI> by their meer intrin&s;ick Worth, prevailed; and they alone retain the univer&s;al Character, as it may be called, in all Payments of whatever kind in the World.</P>
<P>The Cour&s;e of Trade being thus turn|ed, from exchanging of Goods for Goods, or <HI>Delivering</HI> and <HI>Taking,</HI> to <HI>Selling</HI> and <HI>Paying,</HI> all the Bargains in the World are now &s;tated upon the Foot of <HI>a Price</HI> in Money; and tho' it be at any Time an Exchange of <HI>Goods</HI> for <HI>Goods,</HI> yet even tho&s;e Goods are on either &s;ide rated at a <HI>Price</HI> in Money.</P>
<P>Tho' this was a great A&s;&s;i&s;tant to Trade, and gave a liberty to the increa&s;e of Com|merce more than ever it had before, <HI>yet</HI> &s;uch was the great increa&s;e of Trade, that it even over-run the Money it &s;elf, and all the Specie in the World could not an&s;wer the Demand, or be ready ju&s;t at
<PB N="9" REF="7">
Time, Trade called for it. <HI>This occa&s;ioned,</HI> That when <HI>A</HI> Bought more Goods of <HI>B</HI> than <HI>A</HI> had Money to pay for; and <HI>B</HI> having no Need of any Goods that <HI>A</HI> had to Sell; it behoved, that <HI>A</HI> &s;hould leave his Goods with <HI>B</HI> for a certain Time, in which <HI>A</HI> was to provide the Money for the &s;aid Goods: And this was done, both from the Occa&s;ion <HI>B</HI> had to &s;ell his Goods, the Occa&s;ion <HI>A</HI> had to buy them, and the Opinion <HI>B</HI> had of <HI>A</HI>'s Integrity and Ability for Payment.</P>
<P>And this is the Great Thing call'd CREDIT.</P>
<P>CREDIT is a Con&s;equence, not a Cau&s;e; the Effect of a Sub&s;tance, not a Sub&s;tance; 'tis the <HI>Sun-&s;hine,</HI> not the Sun; the quickning SOMETHING, <HI>Call it what you will,</HI> that gives Life to <HI>Trade,</HI> gives Being to the Branches, and Moi&s;ture to the Root; 'tis the <HI>Oil</HI> of the Wheel, the <HI>Marrow</HI> in the Bones, the <HI>Blood</HI> in the Veins, and the <HI>Spirits</HI> in the Heart of all the Negoce, Trade, Ca&s;h, and Commerce in the World.</P>
<P>It is produc'd, and grows in&s;en&s;ibly, from fair and upright Dealing, punctual Compliance, honourable Performance of Contracts and Covenants, in &s;hort, 'tis the Off-&s;pring of univer&s;al Probity.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8">
'Tis apparent, even by its Nature, 'tis no way dependent upon Per&s;ons, Parliaments, or any particular Men, or Sett of Men, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> in the World; but upon <HI>their Conduct</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> Behaviour. <HI>Credit</HI> never was chain'd to Mens <HI>Names,</HI> but to their <HI>Actions;</HI> not to Families, Clans, or Collections of Men; no, not to Nations; 'Tis the Honour, the Ju&s;tice, the Fair-Dealing, and the equal Conduct of <HI>Men,</HI> Bodies of Men, Nations, and People, that rai&s;e the thing call'd <HI>Credit</HI> among them; where&s;oever this is found, CREDIT will live and thrive, grow and encrea&s;e; <HI>where this is wanting,</HI> let all the Power and Wit of Man join toge|ther, they can neither give her Being, or pre&s;erve her Life.</P>
<P>Arts have been try'd, on various Occa|&s;ions in the World, to rai&s;e CREDIT; <HI>Art</HI> has been found able, with more Ea&s;e, to de&s;troy <HI>Credit,</HI> than to rai&s;e it: The Force of <HI>Art,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the punctual, fair, and ju&s;t Dealing <HI>above&s;aid;</HI> may have done much to form a <HI>Credit</HI> upon the Face of Things; but we find &s;till the <HI>Honour</HI> would have done it without the <HI>Art,</HI> but never the <HI>Art</HI> without the <HI>Ho|nour.</HI> Nor will Money it &s;elf, which <HI>Solo|mon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>an&s;wers all things,</HI> purcha&s;e this thing call'd <HI>Credit,</HI> or re&s;tore it when lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="9">
It is in vain to talk of <HI>Credit</HI> without this <HI>Probity:</HI> Hone&s;ty will rai&s;e <HI>Credit</HI> without Money; but all the Money in the World will not rai&s;e <HI>Credit</HI> without the Principle. <HI>D.</HI> was a Prince of high Birth, a great Character for Wit, Gallan|try, and all the Perfections of a Duke and Peer of one of the Polite&s;t Nations in <HI>Europe;</HI> he had, <HI>be&s;ides,</HI> a noble Fortune, built great Edifices, purcha&s;ed great Hou&s;es, maintain'd a va&s;t Equipage, and did every thing with the Air of an exqui|&s;ite and mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Gentleman; he had a va&s;t Fortune, great Offices at Court, nor did he ever want Money; his Stewards were never without 20000 Pi|&s;tols in Ca&s;h; if <HI>any Summ,</HI> however great, was wanting to &s;upport any Point of Honour, for his Play, or to pur|cha&s;e what he had his Eye upon, he knew how to produce it; yet the Barber would not tru&s;t him for a Perriwig; the Coach-maker would not let his Chariot go home with a new Sett of Wheels; <HI>What was the matter?</HI> He would pay no Body generou&s;|ly, or honourably; he would be &s;urroun|ded with Duns as he came out of his Pa|lace, and would go <HI>Incognito</HI> to Court to prevent being in&s;ulted: The <HI>Sbirri,</HI> or <HI>Provo&s;t's Men</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> would &s;top his Coach in the Street, he has been forc'd to
<PB N="12" REF="10">
call a Chair, and leave his Coach and Hor&s;es in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The thing was plain, he had no <HI>Credit;</HI> his great E&s;tate, his high Birth and Qua|lity, his Equipage, his va&s;t Quantity of Gold Plate, his large Ca&s;h, they would not add one Inch to the Stature of his <HI>Credit;</HI> but he liv'd as if he was Poor, and was le&s;s e&s;teem'd in the Shops of the Marchands than a private Gentleman; nay, than one of the <HI>Burgois;</HI> I had al|mo&s;t &s;aid, than a Shoe-maker in the City.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>S&mdash;</HI> is a Gen|tleman of a moderate Fortune, compar'd to the other, but is al&s;o a Man of Quality; he lives Nobly, tho' Frugally; keeps a good Equipage, a hand&s;om Family, does not lay up much, his generous Nature will not permit it; but he pays punctu|ally, no Man comes twice for his Mo|ney; if a Trade&s;man leaves his Bill, he buys no more of him till he comes for his Money; he never Dines till his Wine is paid for; he wears no Cloaths that the Taylor or Mercer can reproach him for, and call THEIRS as he goes along the Street; in&s;tead of having his Door crow|ded with Duns, and his Steward brib'd to pay, he is rather crowded with Shop|keepers to petition for his Cu&s;tom; his Servants are teiz'd to procure their Lord
<PB N="13" REF="11">
to buy here or there, and every one &s;tu|dies to leave his Goods for Approbation. The Trade&s;men are ready to fight, who &s;hall get in his Goods, and Sell often to Lo&s;s, to under-rate one another. What's the Matter? <HI>Credit</HI> &s;tands at his Door; Honour lives there, and <HI>Credit</HI> is her Handmaid. The Count deals ju&s;tly, pays punctually, every Man's Demands are an&s;wer'd, <HI>Credit</HI> courts him, he &s;hall have her Favour, whether he will u&s;e her or no.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to enlarge; Experience tells us the &s;ame thing in all Ca&s;es, whe|ther private or publick, Per&s;onal or Na|tional.</P>
<P><HI>Credit</HI> is the Con&s;equence of ju&s;t and honourable Dealing; fair Propo&s;als pun|ctually perform'd will bring Credit, let the Per&s;on or People be who they will. How do we Trade among the <HI>Turks,</HI> and Tru&s;t the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> one of who&s;e Do|ctrines, in the <HI>Alchor an,</HI> is, not to keep Faith with Chri&s;tians? They have ob|tain'd it by a ju&s;t, punctual, and honour|able Practice <HI>in Trade,</HI> and you <HI>Credit them without Scruple;</HI> nay, rather than a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Upon this Foundation I build what I am in hand with, and bring it down to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e: I know no Per&s;ons or Parties in my Argument: This Lord
<PB N="14" REF="12">
Trea&s;urer or another Lord Trea&s;urer, or no Lord Trea&s;urer, it is the &s;ame thing to me; a Bank or no Bank, 'tis all one, I'll &s;ell none of my Tallies or Annuities, I'll di&s;count no Exchequer Bills: Di&s;&s;olve the Parliament or not Di&s;&s;olve the Parlia|ment, 'tis all one to me; I neither fear, de&s;ire, or am anxious about either; nor can I &s;ee &s;o much Cau&s;e for an A|larm among our People that have Money, as if Credit was pinn'd to the Girdle of a Man, or waited at the Door of the Hou&s;e of Commons; the thing is a Mi&s;take, Credit attends the honourable Manage|ment of your <HI>Trea&s;urers,</HI> your <HI>Exchequers,</HI> your <HI>Parliaments,</HI> whether pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, or to come.</P>
<P>I do not examine what Politic Rea|&s;ons may induce her Maje&s;ty, to change or remove her Great Men in the Mini&s;try; I enquire not whether her Maje&s;ty pur|po&s;es to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament, or to let them Sir, the&s;e things are not concern'd in our Ca&s;e: The late Lord Trea&s;urer, I allow, has done Honourably, has manag'd the Finances with great and un|u&s;ual Dexterity, and has acquir'd thereby the Fame of the Be&s;t Officer, that has for many Years acted in that Po&s;t; I could be content to &s;pend a whole Page in his Prai&s;e; the Nation is infinitely obli|ged to him; and his Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, no
<PB N="15" REF="13">
doubt, has receiv'd infinite Satisfaction in his Conduct, as appears by rejecting all Attempts again&s;t him, and keeping him &s;o long in a Po&s;t of &s;o Great Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>But after this is &s;aid, <HI>Credit,</HI> which has for &s;ome Years been the Nations happy Gue&s;t, by who&s;e Aid &s;uch mighty Things have been done, cannot be &s;aid to be the &s;ole Property of my Lord T&mdash;r Per&s;onally; it is not &s;ingly intail'd upon his Family, or his Name; this would be to go a length his Lord&s;hip him&s;elf has more Mode&s;ty than to claim; no would his Lord&s;hip be well plea&s;ed with any that could think &s;uch cour&s;e kind of Flattery would oblige him.</P>
<P>Our Credit in this Ca&s;e is a Public Thing; it is rightly call'd by &s;ome of our Writers, NATIONAL CREDIT; the Word denominates its Original; 'tis pro|duc'd by <HI>the Nations</HI> Probity, the Honour and exact performing <HI>National Engage|ments.</HI> In this the Great Officers of the Trea&s;ury and Exchequer are, as we may &s;ay, perfectly Pa&s;&s;ive; their Bu&s;ine&s;s is in|deed Active; &s;o the Wheels of a Clock, their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to go round; but they are &s;ubject to the Influence of <HI>their Po&s;i|tion,</HI> the Operations of the Springs and Wheels that guide <HI>their Motion,</HI> by which they act pa&s;&s;ively, if that may be &s;aid, <HI>that is,</HI> of meer Nece&s;&s;ity; and the pun|ctual
<PB N="16" REF="14">
pointing of the Hand to the Lines &s;hewing the Hour, the Minutes and the Seconds, <HI>are Con&s;equences</HI> of the&s;e Motions: The&s;e indeed tell us that the Wheels are good, perfectly made, exact|ly plac'd, and move to a Truth; but the Honour redounds to the <HI>Workman,</HI> who plac'd them in that exact Order, adapted them to their &s;everal U&s;es, and pla|ced &s;uch Springs and Wheels about them, which by their like exactne&s;s, but all de|riv'd from the &s;ame Original, oblige eve|ry part punctually to perform the End of the whole Movement.</P>
<P>CREDIT is not the Effect of this or that Wheel in the Government, moving regular and ju&s;t to its proper Work; but of the whole Movement, a|cting by the Force of its true original Mo|tion, according to the exqui&s;ite De|&s;ign of the Director of the whole Frame.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Honour,</HI> the <HI>Probity,</HI> the <HI>exact,</HI> punctual <HI>Management,</HI> which has rai&s;ed our <HI>Credit</HI> to the pitch it is now arriv'd at, has not been merely the Great Wheel in <HI>the Nations Clockwork,</HI> that turn'd about the Trea&s;ure, but the Great Spring that turn'd about that Wheel, and this is the QUEEN and PARLIAMENT. <HI>The one,</HI> the Spring <HI>(&s;till keeping to the Allegory)</HI> that gives Motion or Life to the whole; <HI>the other,</HI> the Balance or Pendulum,
<PB N="17" REF="15">
that regulates that Motion, keeps it true to, and exact in the performance of the General Work, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the equal and punctual dividing the &s;malle&s;t mea&s;ures of Time.</P>
<P><HI>This Nice Ca&s;e</HI> requires me a little to de&s;cend to Particulars, and touch Mat|ter of Fact nearer than was intended; What is it has re&s;tored and recovered the Nations <HI>Credit</HI> from the Breaches made in it? The an&s;wering this nece&s;&s;arily re|quires that I &s;hould al&s;o ask what made the former Breaches in <HI>our Credit?</HI> I &s;hall do this as Mode&s;tly as I can; for it is not the pre&s;ent Work to open Sores, but to heal them, to prevent more from breaking out.</P>
<P>Some of the Rea&s;ons which &s;unk <HI>our Credit,</HI> and made the Breaches in it in the late Reign, were the &s;ettling Funds that were in them&s;elves deficient; and making no Provin&s;ion to &s;upply tho&s;e De|ficiencies. Some would perhaps go far|ther, and &s;ay, It was &s;ettling Funds that <HI>were not probable,</HI> and who&s;e Deficiencies Were vi&s;ible. I &s;hall not go that length; the Error was in the Original; it would be unju&s;t to charge the Deficiency of the&s;e Funds upon the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury <HI>for the Time being,</HI> it would be &s;till harder to blame them for the Par|liament
<PB N="18" REF="16">
not &s;upplying tho&s;e Deficiencies. Some may have &s;aid they were to blame in the Fir&s;t Act, becau&s;e it was their Work to provide Funds, and the Parliament on|ly gave what they ask'd; that they took them and went away &s;atisfied, as &s;uffici|ent for the &s;upply of the Occa&s;ion, and that they were Judges of the probability: <HI>I am not of that mind,</HI> tho' it is not to my purpo&s;e here to debate it. But this is Certain, the not &s;upplying the Deficien|cies upon the repeated Application of the Per&s;ons who&s;e E&s;tates lay in tho&s;e Defici|encies, &s;eem'd wholly to lye at the Door of the Parliament, and this brought the Tallies on tho&s;e Funds to intollerable, un|heard of Di&s;counts, to the ruin of all that we <HI>called Credit.</HI></P>
<P>What then has rai&s;ed <HI>this Credit?</HI> I hope I do not detract from the ju&s;t Cha|racter of him, whom one calls the great Guide of the Nation's Trea&s;ure, if I &s;ay, It was &s;omething el&s;e than his Lord&s;hip's Management; &s;omething Prior to it, <HI>in which</HI> that National Honour and Ju&s;tice, Re&s;olution of punctual Payment and Con|cern for the Means of it, <HI>appeared,</HI> which put Life into the Nation, and made tho&s;e People that had Money think it <HI>as &s;afe,</HI> as well depo&s;ited, and the Principal in as <HI>good Hands</HI> as in their own; &s;o that they
<PB N="19" REF="17">
were perfectly Ea&s;ie in adventuring their Money, and the longer this went on, the forwarder were the People to bring in their Money: Nay, &s;o forward, that the fa&s;ter the Government lower'd their In|tere&s;t, the more eager were the People to bring in their Money.</P>
<P><HI>Let us &s;ee</HI> where this began, and this will tell us <HI>who&s;e doing</HI> it was. After the fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament of Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, the Queen acquainted the Hou&s;e, That the Funds had more than an&s;wered the Sums <HI>they were given for;</HI> there was the capital Wound of Deficiency healed at once. That the Overplus &s;hould be apply'd, &amp;c. There was an A&s;&s;urance, that all Defi|ciencies, if any happen'd, &s;hould be made good. This gave <HI>the Parliament Part</HI> a Brightne&s;s that reviv'd the Spirits of the People, help'd open their Pur&s;es which had been &s;o long clo&s;ed, and cau|&s;ed Taxes to be rai&s;ed without murmu|ring.</P>
<P><HI>The Queen</HI> acted the next part; Her Maje&s;ty gave con&s;tant A&s;&s;urances, that every thing given &s;hould be <HI>rightly apply'd;</HI> and to Encourage her People, and &s;hew &s;he was willing <HI>to bear a part</HI> of their Bur|then, the Queen generou&s;ly threw in <HI>an Hundred thou&s;and Pownd</HI> of her own Mo|ney, <HI>appropriated for the Civil Li&s;t,</HI> to ea&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="18">
the Nation of &s;o much in that Years Bur|then. <HI>The&s;e were Steps</HI> no Prince ever was known to take before. <HI>After this</HI> you never heard of a Complaint of the heavy Burthen of the Taxes, tho' greater far than any rai&s;ed in the former Reign; on the contrary, <HI>the more</HI> you rais'd, <HI>the ea&s;ier</HI> they were paid; <HI>the more</HI> the Nation ran in Debt, <HI>the higher</HI> their Credit ro&s;e every day. <HI>After this</HI> you never had any Commi&s;|&s;ioners of Accounts ask'd for, or any Que|&s;tion about Mi&s;application. <HI>No Man</HI> need go far for a Rea&s;on for this; <HI>the Credit</HI> cen|tred all in the Queen, who&s;e Concern was &s;o vi&s;ible for her Peoples good, that &s;he would &s;uffer no Mi&s;applications; that &s;he would Employ none but in whom &s;he could place entire Confidence; who&s;e Probity and Exactne&s;s her Maje&s;ty could an&s;wer for <HI>to her &s;elf,</HI> and was well a&s;|&s;ured &s;he might be <HI>&s;afe in.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis no way le&s;&s;ening the Honour of the Servants her Maje&s;ty Cho&s;e, to &s;ay that the Nations Credit depends not on the Reputation of their Conduct; but on her Maje&s;ty's Care, in Cho&s;ing &s;uch Men, who&s;e Conduct would perform all the Nation could expect; and that if they &s;hould fail, her Maje&s;ty would not fail to remove them, and put in others. This is putting the thing right; the Sum and
<PB N="21" REF="19">
Sub&s;tance of the Argument is this, in &s;hort.</P>
<P><HI>Publick Credit</HI> is the Con&s;equence of honourable, ju&s;t, and punctual Manage|ment in the Matter of <HI>Funds</HI> and <HI>Taxes,</HI> or Loans upon them. Where this goes before, Credit always follows.</P>
<P><HI>This Management</HI> depends not upon the Well-Executing their Offices, by the great Officers of the Trea&s;ury, and the Exchequer, but on the <HI>Care, Conduct</HI> and <HI>Vigilance</HI> of her Maje&s;ty and the Parlia|ment; <HI>the latter</HI> in E&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ufficient Funds; and <HI>the former</HI> in Placing able Offi|cers, and obliging them to an honourable Management.</P>
<P>The <HI>Publick Credit</HI> therefore depends upon the Queen and Parliament entirely, and not at all upon the well or ill Ma|nagement of the Officers, of what kind &s;oever.</P>
<P>Another thing confirms this, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That while the Parliament Concerns it &s;elf to prevent the Deficiency of Funds, and the Queen to Place Men of Probity and Honour in the Government of her Trea&s;ury; <HI>there is no Que&s;tion to be made,</HI> but both would concern them&s;elves <HI>upon any Complaints of the Subject,</HI> to enquire into any Mi&s;management or Abu&s;e of the People, in the greate&s;t Officers; and not only puni&s;h the Offender, but <HI>prevent the</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="20">
<HI>Offence,</HI> by removing &s;uch Officer, and &s;upplying his Place with others, who &s;hould better di&s;charge &s;o weighty a Tru&s;t. This re&s;olves the Point, That Credit centers where the Government centers; for if the Sovereign di&s;places tho&s;e that mi&s;-apply, the Wound to Cre|dit heals of it &s;elf; and while the Sove|reign carefully prefers Men of Honour and Probity in the Nations Tru&s;t, Credit ri&s;es by a natural Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But &s;till it is the NATIONS CRE|DIT; <HI>that is,</HI> it is built on the Honour of the Queen and Parliament, as above; and this has been the Ca&s;e of the late Lord Trea&s;urer; the Credit of who&s;e Management mu&s;t return to the Queen, as to the Center; otherwi&s;e this mu&s;t be call'd <HI>My Lord T . . . .'s Credit,</HI> not the <HI>Nations;</HI> and, to our great lo&s;s, mu&s;t dye with his Lord&s;hip; which would be very unhappy <HI>for us;</HI> and would im|ply, that we ought to be more concern'd for his Lord&s;hip's long Life than the Queen's; a thing would very ill plea&s;e e|ven his Lord&s;hip to &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>Having laid down this as a Foun|dation, I build this &s;hort Fabrick upon it, <HI>(viz.) That as</HI> the Publick Credit is <HI>National,</HI> not <HI>Per&s;onal,</HI> &s;o it depends upon No <HI>thing</HI> or <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> No <HI>Man</HI> or <HI>Body of</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="21">
<HI>Men,</HI> but upon the Government, <HI>that is,</HI> The Queen and Parliament; di&s;placing or removing any Mini&s;ter of State, or great Officer, who&s;e Management under the So|vereign affects our Trea&s;ure, can no way influence our <HI>National Credit;</HI> while the Ju&s;t, Honourable and Punctual Conduct of the Sovereign and Parliament remains the &s;ame. Neither does our Credit de|pend upon the Per&s;on of the Queen, <HI>as Queen,</HI> or the individual Hou&s;e of Com|mons, <HI>Identically;</HI> as if <HI>no Queen</HI> but her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and <HI>no Parliament</HI> but the pre&s;ent Parliament, could &s;upport and uphold the Credit of the Nation: <HI>But</HI> it will remain a Truth, that <HI>every Queen,</HI> or <HI>every King,</HI> and <HI>every Parlia|ment,</HI> &s;ucceeding the Pre&s;ent, that &s;hall di&s;cover the <HI>&s;ame Ju&s;tice</HI> in Government, the <HI>&s;ame Care</HI> in giving &s;ufficient Funds, the <HI>&s;ame Hone&s;ty</HI> in &s;upplying the Defici|encies if they happen, <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Concern for the Burthen of the Subject, and <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Care to put the Trea&s;ure into the Hands of Faithful and Experienc'd Offi|cers; &s;hall keep up <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Character, have <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Credit, and re&s;tore all the&s;e Declinings to <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Vigour and Mag|nitude, as ever.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="22">
<HI>From hence it appears,</HI> That our pre&s;ent Lo&s;s of <HI>Credit</HI> does not ari&s;e from any Doubt, whether the like Conduct can produce this Effect or no; but from a &s;trange Sugge&s;tion, That a new Parlia|ment, or a new Mini&s;try, &s;hall either <HI>not De&s;ign</HI> or not <HI>Pur&s;ue</HI> the &s;ame vigorous and wi&s;e Re&s;olutions, or mannage with <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Integrity, as the la&s;t have done. If her Maje&s;ty &s;aw room &s;or this Sugge&s;ti|on, I make no doubt, (her Concern for the Publick Good <HI>is &s;uch</HI>) that no &s;uch Change had been made, or would lodge an Hour longer among her Thoughts; but if her Maje&s;ty is of the Opinion, that &s;uch a Change will not le&s;&s;en the Concern <HI>for,</HI> or ju&s;t Mea&s;ures <HI>in</HI> the Publick Service, then the Difficulty ends. Her Maje&s;ty has now put new Officers into her Trea&s;ury: No doubt her Maje&s;ty <HI>is &s;atisfied</HI> it &s;hall be in their Power to pre&s;erve the <HI>Publick Credit,</HI> and re&s;tore it to as great a height as ever it was before, And I will pre&s;ume to add, That if her Maje&s;ty &s;hould find it other|wi&s;e, it wouldbe an effectual Motive to <HI>far|ther Changes</HI> till &s;uch Hands &s;hould be found, in who&s;e Conduct the <HI>National Credit</HI> could not Mi&s;carry.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that the pre&s;ent Di&s;contents are grounded upon <HI>a Suppo&s;ition,</HI> That a New Mini&s;try &s;hall be le&s;s zealous for
<PB N="25" REF="23">
the Publick Intere&s;t, than the pre&s;ent; or, at lea&s;t, the Objectors argue, that her Maje&s;ty has &s;ufficient Experience of the Zeal of the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, <HI>for her Service,</HI> and for the Public Good; and therefore it cannot &s;eem rational to run that Ri&s;que, and the like, of a New Par|liament.</P>
<P>To this may be an&s;wer'd; Why &s;hould it be &s;ugge&s;ted, that a New Parli|ament &s;hall not be equally zealous for the Liberties of <HI>Britain</HI> with the pre&s;ent? They are to be cho&s;en by the Freeholders, they are to be Engli&s;hmen; they are to be Prote&s;tants; they are to abjure the Pretender; they are to be join'd with <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Hou&s;e of Lords, to be ble&s;&s;ed with <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Queen; and the Queen, I doubt not, fill'd with <HI>the &s;ame</HI> Principles as before; <HI>the &s;ame</HI> by which her Maje|&s;ty, for I mu&s;t place it there, <HI>re&s;tor'd the Nations Credit before,</HI> and rai&s;ed it to what we have now &s;een it.</P>
<P>Shall we &s;ay, The Parliament will not rai&s;e Money to carry on the War? This would be to &s;ay, We &s;hall choo&s;e &s;uch a Parliament as will <HI>declare the Pretender, for&s;ake</HI> the Confederacy, <HI>join</HI> with the Common Enemy, and <HI>Depo&s;e</HI> the Queen. The&s;e are Fears no thinking Man can &s;uppo&s;e to be rational; and are &s;pread a|bout
<PB N="26" REF="24">
by none <HI>but tho&s;e</HI> that de&s;ire it &s;hould be &s;o; and who, crying out loude&s;t of the Fall of <HI>Public Credit,</HI> procure the thing they complain of; and indeed we have no Breach of <HI>our Credit,</HI> but what ri&s;es from the&s;e Men.</P>
<P>To back their Fears, and make others think them rea&s;onable, they give long Accounts of the Progre&s;s of Dr. <HI>Sacheve|rell,</HI> as if the Folly and Impolitick Vanity of that Gentleman could influence the People of <HI>England,</HI> to &s;end up Men as <HI>mad</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> as him&s;elf: I mu&s;t profe&s;s to think, if Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> thinks he &s;erves the Intere&s;t he pretends to appear for, by his mobbing and riotous Progre&s;s, he is as much mi&s;taken <HI>as they were,</HI> who made him Popular by a ha&s;ty Pro&s;ecution, in|&s;tead of committing his Sermon to the Hang-Man, and kicking him from the Bar for a Lunatic; which if they had done, the Nation had been more in Debt to <HI>their Prudence,</HI> than I think they are now for <HI>their Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>I am again&s;t Furies on both &s;ides; nor do I &s;ee any &s;uch coming in: If her Maje|&s;ty does let in any &s;uch, <HI>I dare pre&s;ume to &s;ay,</HI> it mu&s;t be for want of having their due Character; and the Term of their Services may probably end when they di&s;cover them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="25">
But if Men of Moderation, and Men of Integrity come in, I &s;ee no room to fear, but <HI>our Credit</HI> &s;hall revive as well under a New Mini&s;try as an Old.</P>
<P><HI>I know,</HI> that &s;ome talk of a Stagnation of the Fountain; that there is a Famine of Funds; that the Nation is exhau&s;ted, and we are at a full Stop: This I take to be <HI>an Amu&s;ement,</HI> that comes over from <HI>France,</HI> and is calculated very much for the Service of the Enemy. But there are ways to get over the Difficulty, and the be&s;t way is Demon&s;tration and Experi|ence; I believe the <HI>French</HI> King does not rai&s;e half &s;o much Hopes from our not being able to find any Funds at all, as from our being at a lo&s;s for Credit to borrow upon tho&s;e Funds when they are rai&s;ed; and he may live to be deceived in both.</P>
<P>But to obviate the&s;e things, <HI>I take the liberty to &s;ay,</HI> and that not without-book, When the Parliament meets, be it the pre&s;ent Parliament, or a new Parliament; be it the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, or a new Mi|ni&s;try; as I hope there will not want Zeal in the Members, to &s;upply her Ma|je&s;ty's Occa&s;ions for the War; &s;o were this War to hold Seven Years longer, it is ea&s;y to propo&s;e &s;ufficient Funds for the carrying it on, without that horrid Propo|&s;al of mortgaging our <HI>Land-Tax,</HI> or with|out
<PB N="28" REF="26">
any <HI>&s;uch Taxes,</HI> as &s;hall either be bur|then&s;om to the Poor, or &s;candalous to the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>As to Credit,</HI> while the Parliament and the Queen continue to pre&s;erve tho&s;e Funds from Deficiencies, to make good &s;uch as happen, and to &s;upport the Vi|gour and Honour of the Publick Manage|ment; I &s;ee no room to doubt, but <HI>Credit</HI> &s;hall revive, and as we have not yet found any Fund the Parliament has rais'd, un|&s;upply'd with Loans and Advances upon it, even fa&s;ter than could be de&s;ired; &s;o I can &s;ee no room to fear the contrary: Yet if &s;uch a Thing &s;hould happen, a mean Head may find out &s;ome Expedient that may not be ineffectual; for a Supply of which, if there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion, a Propo&s;al &s;hall not be wanting.</P>
