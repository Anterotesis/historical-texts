<P>AMANA. A Dramatic Poem.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tory of this piece is taken from the moral and ingenious writings, lately publi&s;hed, &s;tiled THE ADVENTURER, Numbers 72 and 73. But the Drama, which was too much confined in the fable, has been inlarged here, by the addition of four per&s;ons, namely, NARDIC, ABDALLAH, FATIMA, and HAMET. For tho' NARDIC, and ABDALLAH (SANBAD, in the original) are mentioned in the &s;tory, they are not introduced into the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Some other alterations have been made in the fable, in order to accommodate the repre&s;entation to a Briti&s;h audi|ence: the machinery of genie's has been laid a&s;ide, and the cata&s;troph&eacute; brought to pa&s;s without the declared inter|po&s;ition of &s;uperior agents: the time and place too, have been re&s;trained, to pre&s;erve two of the unities. Shake&s;pear alone could <HI>call &s;pirits from the va&s;ty deep</HI>; he was him&s;elf a &s;uperior intelligence; could create beings not to be found in nature or fable, could rock ages to &s;leep to ha&s;ten his events, and <HI>annihilate both time and &s;pace,</HI> to bring the hi&s;tory of a man within the repre&s;entation of a day.
<Q><L>"Exi&s;tence &s;aw him &s;purn her bounded reign,</L>
<L>"And panting time toiled after him in vain."</L></Q>
But modern wits are no more able to &s;tride in Shake&s;pear's bu&s;kin, than modern beaus to &s;hoot in Uly&s;&s;es' bow.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">The moral, profe&s;&s;ed in the original &s;tory, is, <HI>To &s;hew the folly of human wi&s;hes and &s;chemes for correcting the moral government of the world</HI>; which &s;entiment is pre|&s;erved here in a &s;peech of Amana's.</P>
<Q><L>O Nouradin!</L>
<L>Forgive this fatal ra&s;hne&s;s&mdash;Had I &s;taid</L>
<L>A few &s;hort moments, we had now been ble&s;t;</L>
<L>But wre&s;ting from the hand of providence</L>
<L>The means of my e&s;cape, we both are wretched.</L></Q>
<P>But I confe&s;s that the reflections which occurred to my mind mo&s;t &s;trongly, on the peru&s;al of this tale, were a tender and humane re&s;entment of the mi&s;eries of tho&s;e nations which are &s;ubject to de&s;potic power, and an exulting &s;en&s;e of the peculiar ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, that we enjoy in the&s;e thrice happy kingdoms.</P>
<P>The contemplation of this contra&s;t, both &s;ugge&s;ted and in&s;pired the plan of the following writing; in which I have endeavoured to contribute my grateful mite of prai&s;e to tho&s;e laws, and to that government, under which our &s;u|perior advantages are e&s;tabli&s;hed, defended, and pre&s;erved; and however the pre&s;umption of this attempt may be con|demned, I hope that the faults of the performance may be pardoned, as the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Beg leave to lay at your lady&s;hip's feet a work, which from the &s;pirit of liberty it at|tempts to breathe, may hope for the honour of your patronage. Your lady&s;hip's own character ju&s;tifies this addre&s;s, and the names of PERCY and SEYMOUR demand it. Hi&s;tory is my voucher, and fame my herald. Liberty was their cre&s;t, and Glory their motto.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch an heroic &s;ubject is beyond my &s;trength, and I &s;hall content my&s;elf with prai&s;ing and admiring the more &s;ocial and amiable virtues of your lady&s;hip, your humanity, benevolence and affability; which latter quality is the cha|racteri&s;tic of true nobility, in oppo&s;ition to that haughtine&s;s which is frequently ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e who have &s;prung from ob&s;curity&mdash;Tho&s;e who are placed on an eminence may <HI>de&s;cend,</HI> but tho&s;e on a level would <HI>ri&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5">IF this little work, the offspring of a female and unlettered pen, &s;hall be &s;o happy to amu&s;e your lady&s;hip for half an hour, it will afford the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction to the author, who humbly pre&s;umes to hope, that your lady&s;hip's candour will pardon whatever defects your judgment may find in this piece, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e &s;entiments it is intended to convey.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, With the profounde&s;t re&s;pect, and humble&s;t duty, MADAM, Your mo&s;t humble and obedient &s;ervant, ELIZA GRIFFITH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
