<P>AFTER a Series of Misfortunes, and meeting with the mo&s;t ungenerous Treatment, from &s;ome whom I lea&s;t &s;u&s;|pected, and lea&s;t de&s;erv'd it from, I feel the additional Grievance of being a Pri&s;oner in the <HI>Fleet</HI>; tho' I have a&s;&s;ign'd Two Thirds of my future Salary for the Payment of my Debts, if my Creditors will be &s;o good to allow me Liberty to work for them, as well as my&s;elf: While I &s;eem to complain of Want of Lenity in &s;ome, Gratitude obliges me to acknowledge the Favour &s;hewn me by others; as Several, who&s;e Demands on me are large&s;t, have not only the Humanity to come into this Propo&s;al them&s;elves, but have endea|vour'd to in&s;til the &s;ame generous Sentiments into the re&s;t. Yet a few are unkind enough to have continu'd me (for the&s;e five Months pa&s;t) in a Place, where I am incapable of geting Bread, either for my&s;elf or Children. The Mind may be free, tho' the Body's confin'd; as a Proof of which, I employ'd a little of my Lei&s;ure in the few following Lines: If they in any Degree prove acceptable to the Publick, I am over pay'd.</P>
<P>My Impatience to atte&s;t my Loyalty and Affection to the Per&s;on of his Maje&s;ty and the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, may, perhaps, make me too quick in the Publication of what I have thus loo&s;ely thrown on Paper, and the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my Inability to perfect the Task I have undertaken, require &s;ome Apology; &mdash; Let the Hone&s;ty of the Intention plead my Excu&s;e: If I am found to be a good Subject, I'll not repine at being thought an indifferent Poet. I think, at this Juncture, it becomes not an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to be totally &s;ilent, unwatchful, or inactive; Neutrality, at this Cri&s;is, is a Crime: And may we not rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e Gentry are not quite &s;ound of Heart, who, like their politick Friend <HI>Scrub</HI> in the <HI>Stratagem,</HI> re&s;olve
