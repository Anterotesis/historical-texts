<HEAD>Progre&s;s of MANNERS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are peculiarities in the appearance, in the expre&s;&s;ions, in the actions, of &s;ome per&s;ons, which, in oppo&s;ition to the manners of the generality, are termed their manners. Such peculiarities in the bulk of a nation, by which it differs from other nations, or from it&s;elf at different periods, are termed the manners of that nation. Manners therefore &s;ignify a mode of behaviour pe|culiar to a certain per&s;on, or to a certain nation. The term is not applied to mankind in general; except perhaps in contradi&s;tinction to other beings.</P>
<P>Manners are di&s;tingui&s;hed from morals; but in what re&s;pect has not been clearly explained. Do not the &s;ame actions relate to both? Certainly; but in different re&s;pects: an action con&s;idered as right or wrong, belongs to morals; con&s;idered as
<PB N="2" REF="6">
characteri&s;tical of a per&s;on, or of a people, it be|longs to manners.</P>
<P>Manners, peculiar to certain tribes and to certain governments, fall under other branches of this work. The intention of the pre&s;ent &s;ketch is, to trace out the manners of nations, in the different &s;tages of their progre&s;s, from infancy to maturity. I am far from regretting, that manners, produced by climate, by &s;oil, and by other permanent cau&s;es, fall not under my plan: I &s;hould indeed make but a poor figure upon a &s;ubject that has been learnedly di&s;cu&s;|&s;ed by the greate&s;t genius of the pre&s;ent age<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Monte&s;quieu.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I begin with external appearance, being the fir&s;t thing that draws attention. The human counte|nance hath a greater variety of expre&s;&s;ions than that of any other animal; and &s;ome per&s;ons differ wide|ly from the generality in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions. The &s;ame variety is ob&s;ervable in human ge&s;tures; and the &s;ame peculiarity in particular per&s;ons, &s;o as to be known by their manner of walking, or even by &s;o &s;light an action as that of putting on or taking off a hat; &s;ome men are known even by the &s;ound of their feet. Whole nations are di&s;tingui&s;hable by the &s;ame peculiarities. And yet there is le&s;s va|riety in looks and ge&s;tures, than the different tones of mind would produce, were men left to the im|pul&s;es of pure nature: man, an imitative animal, is prone to copy others; and by imitation, external behaviour is nearly uniform among tho&s;e who &s;tudy to be agreeable; witne&s;s people of fa&s;hion in France. I am acquainted with a blind man, who, without moving his feet, is con&s;tantly balancing from &s;ide to &s;ide, excited probably by &s;ome internal impul&s;e. Had he been endowed with eye-&s;ight, he would have imitated the manners of others. I re&s;t upon the&s;e outlines: to enter fully into the
<PB N="3" REF="7">
&s;ubject would be an endle&s;s work; di&s;proportioned at any rate to the narrowne&s;s of my plan.</P>
<P>Dre&s;s mu&s;t not be omitted, becau&s;e it enters into external appearance. Providence hath clothed all animals that are unable to clothe them&s;elves. Man can clothe him&s;elf; and he is endowed be&s;ide with an appetite for dre&s;s, no le&s;s natural than an appe|tite for food. That appetite is proportioned in de|gree to its u&s;e: in cold climates it is vigorous; in hot climates, extremely faint. Savages mu&s;t go naked till they learn to cover them&s;elves; and they &s;oon learn where covering is nece&s;&s;ary. The Pata|gonians, who go naked in a bitter-cold climate, mu&s;t be woefully &s;tupid. And the Picts, a Scotch tribe, who, it is &s;aid, continued naked down to the time of Severus, did not probably much &s;urpa&s;s the Patagonians in the talent of invention.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty is another cau&s;e for clothing: few &s;a|vages expo&s;e the whole of the body without cover|ing. It gives no high idea of Grecian mode&s;ty, that at the Olympic games people wre&s;tled and run races &s;tark naked.</P>
<P>There is a third cau&s;e for clothing, which is, the plea&s;ure it affords. A fine woman, &s;een naked once in her life, is a de&s;irable object; de&s;ire being inflamed by novelty. But let her go naked for a month; how much more charming will &s;he appear, when dre&s;&s;ed with propriety and elegance! Cloath|ing is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to health, that to be le&s;s agreeable than nakedne&s;s would argue an incongruity in our nature. Savages probably at fir&s;t thought of cloath|ing as a protection only again&s;t the weather; but they &s;oon di&s;covered a beauty in dre&s;s: men led the way, and women followed. Such &s;avages as go naked, paint their bodies, excited by the &s;ame fondne&s;s for ornament, that our women &s;hew in their party-coloured garments. Among the Jews,
<PB N="4" REF="8">
the men wore ear-rings as well as the women<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxii. 2.</NOTE>. When Media was governed by its own kings, the men were &s;umptuous in dre&s;s: they wore loo&s;e robes, floating in the air; had long hair covered with a rich bonnet, bracelets, chains of gold, and precious &s;tones: they painted their faces, and mix|ed artificial hair with that of nature. As authors are &s;ilent about the women, they probably made no figure in that kingdom, being &s;hut up, as at pre&s;ent, in &s;eraglios. Very different was the ca&s;e of Athenian ladies, after polygamy was bani&s;hed from Greece. They con&s;umed the whole morning at the toilette; employing paint, and every drug for cleaning and whitening the &s;kin: they laid red even upon their lips, and took great care of their teeth: their hair, made up in buckles with a hot iron, was per&s;umed and &s;pread upon the &s;houlders: their dre&s;s was elegant, and artfully contrived to &s;et off a fine &s;hape. Such is the influence of appetite for dre&s;s: vanity could not be the &s;ole motive, as Athenian ladies were never &s;een in public. We learn from St. Gregory, that women in his time dre&s;&s;ed their heads extremely high; environing them with many tre&s;&s;es of fal&s;e hair, di&s;po&s;ed in knots and buckles, &s;o as to re&s;emble a regular forti|fication. Jo&s;ephus reports, that the Jewi&s;h ladies powdered their hair with gold du&s;t; a fa&s;hion that was carried from A&s;ia to Rome. The fir&s;t writer who mentions white powder for the hair, the &s;ame we u&s;e at pre&s;ent, is L'Etoile, in his journal for the year 159<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. He relates, that nuns walked the &s;treets of Paris curled and powdered. That fa&s;hion &s;pread by degrees through Europe. For many years after the civil wars in France, it was the fa&s;hion in Paris to wear boots and &s;purs with a long &s;word; a gentleman was not in full dre&s;s without
<PB N="5" REF="9">
the&s;e accoutrements. The &s;word continues an ar|ticle of dre&s;s, tho' it di&s;tingui&s;hes not a gentleman from his valet. To &s;how that a ta&s;te for dre&s;s and ornament is deeply rooted in human nature, &s;avages di&s;play that ta&s;te upon the body, having no cover|ing to di&s;play it upon. Seldom is a child left to nature: it is deprived of a te&s;ticle, a finger, a tooth; or its &s;kin is engraved with figures.</P>
<P>Cloathing hath no &s;light influence, even with re&s;pect to morals. I venture to affirm, at the ha|zard of being thought paradoxical, that nakedne&s;s is more friendly to cha&s;tity than covering. Adultery is unknown among &s;avages, even in hot climates where they have &s;carce any covering. A woman dre&s;&s;ed with ta&s;te is a more de&s;irable object than one who always goes naked. Dre&s;s, be&s;ide, gives play to the imagination, which pictures to it&s;elf many &s;ecret beauties, that vani&s;h when rendered familiar by &s;ight: if a lady accidentally di&s;covers half a leg, imagination is in&s;tantly inflamed, tho' an actre&s;s appearing in breeches is beheld with in|difference: a naked Venus makes not &s;uch an im|pre&s;&s;ion, as when a garter only is di&s;covered. In Sparta, men and women lived together without any re&s;erve: public baths were common to both; and in certain games they danced and combated toge|ther naked as when born. In a later period, the Spartan dames were much corrupted; occa&s;ioned, as authors &s;ay, by a &s;hameful freedom of intercour&s;e between the &s;exes. But remark, that corruption was not confined to the female &s;ex, men having degenerated as much from their original manhood as women from their original cha&s;tity; and I have no difficulty to maintain, that gold and &s;ilver, ad|mitted contrary to the laws of Lycurgus, were what corrupted both &s;exes. Opulence could not fail to have the &s;ame effect there that it has every where; which is to excite luxury and &s;en&s;uality.
<PB N="6" REF="10">
The Spartans accordingly, &s;haking off au&s;terity of manners, abandoned them&s;elves to plea&s;ure: the mo&s;t expen&s;ive furniture, the &s;ofte&s;t beds, &s;uperb tape&s;try, precious va&s;es, exqui&s;ite wines, delicious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ands, were not now too delicate for an effeminate Spartan, once illu&s;trious for every manly virtue. Lycurgus under&s;tood human nature better than the writers do who carp at him. It was his intention, to make his countrymen &s;oldiers, not whining lovers: and he ju&s;tly thought, that familiar inter|cour&s;e between the &s;exes would confine their appe|tites within the bounds of nature; an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to women of fa&s;hion in our days, who expo&s;e their nakedne&s;s in order to attract and en&s;lame lovers. What ju&s;tifies this rea&s;oning is, the a&s;cendant that Spartan dames had over their hu&s;bands while the laws of Lycurgus were in vigour: they in effect ruled the &s;tate as well as their own families. Such a&s;cendant cannot be obtained nor pre&s;erved but by &s;trict virtue: a woman of loo&s;e manners may be the object of loo&s;e de&s;ire; but &s;eldom will &s;he gain an a&s;cendant over any man, and never over her hu&s;band. Among no people was there more free|dom of intercour&s;e than among the ancient Ger|mans: males and females &s;lept promi&s;cuou&s;ly round the walls of their hou&s;es; and yet we never read of an attempt upon a married woman. The &s;ame holds true of the Scotch highlanders.</P>
<P>Cleanline&s;s is an article in external appearance. Whether it be inherent in the nature of man, or only a refinement of poli&s;hed nations, may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear doubtful. What pleads for the former is, that cleanline&s;s is remarkable in &s;everal nations that have made little progre&s;s in the arts of life. The &s;avages of the Caribbee i&s;lands, once a nume|rous tribe, were remarked by writers as neat and cleanly. In the i&s;land Otaheite, or King George's I&s;land, both &s;exes are cleanly: they bathe fre|quently,
<PB N="7" REF="11">
never eat nor drink without wa&s;hing be|fore and after, and their garments as well as their per&s;ons are kept free of &s;pot or blemi&s;h. Ammi|anus Marcellinus, de&s;cribing the Gauls, &s;ays, that they were cleanly; and that even the poore&s;t wo|men were never &s;een with dirty garments. The negroes, particularly tho&s;e of Ardrah in the &s;lave|coa&s;t, have a &s;crupulous regard to cleanline&s;s. They wa&s;h morning and evening, and per&s;ume them&s;elves with aromatic herbs. In the city of Benin, in Guinea, women are employ'd to keep the &s;treets clean; and in that re&s;pect they are not outdone by the Dutch. In Corea, people mourn three years for the death of their parents; during which time they never wa&s;h. Dirtine&s;s mu&s;t ap|pear di&s;mal to that people, as to us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many animals are remarkable for cleanline&s;s. Beavers are &s;o, and &s;o are cats. This mu&s;t be natural. Tho' a ta&s;te for cleanline&s;s is not remarkable in dogs, yet, like men, they learn to be cleanly.</NOTE>. But in|&s;tances are no le&s;s numerous that favour the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. Amminianus Marcellinus re|ports of the Huns, that they wore the &s;ame coat till it fell to pieces with dirt and rottenne&s;s. Plan Carpin, who vi&s;ited the Tartars anno 1246, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they never wa&s;h face nor hands; that they never clean a di&s;h, a pot, nor a garment; that, like &s;wine, they made food of every thing, not excepting the vermin that crawl on them."</Q> The pre&s;ent people of Kam&s;katka an&s;wer to that de&s;crip|tion in every article. The na&s;line&s;s of North American &s;avages, in their food, in their cabins, and in their garments, pa&s;&s;es all conception. As they never change their garments till they fall to rags, nor ever think of wa&s;hing them, they are eat up with vermin. The E&s;quimaux, and many other tribes, are equally na&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="12">
As cleanne&s;s requires attention and indu&s;try, the cleanline&s;s of &s;ome &s;avages mu&s;t be the work of nature and the dirtine&s;s of others mu&s;t proceed from indolence counteracting nature. In fact, cleanline&s;s is agreeable to all; and na&s;tine&s;s di&s;a|greeable: no per&s;on prefers dirt; and even tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t accu&s;tomed to it, are plea&s;ed with a cleanly appearance in others. It is true, that a ta&s;te for cleanne&s;s, like that for order, for &s;ymmetry, for congruity, is extremely faint during its infancy among &s;avages. Its &s;tronge&s;t antagoni&s;t is indolence, which &s;avages indulge to exce&s;s: the great fatigue they undergo in hunting makes them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">nd of ea&s;e at home; and dirtine&s;s, when once habitual, is not ea&s;ily conquered. But cleanline&s;s improves gradually with manners, and makes a figure in every indu&s;trious nation. Nor is a ta&s;te for cleanne&s;s bellow'd on man in vain: its final cau&s;e is con&s;picuous, cleanne&s;s being extremely whole&s;ome, and na&s;tine&s;s no le&s;s unwhole&s;ome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The plague, pe&s;tilential &s;evers, and other putrid di&s;ea&s;es, were more frequent in Europe formerly than at pre&s;ent; e&s;pecially in great cities, where multitudes were crowded together in &s;mall hou&s;es, and narrow &s;treets. Paris, in the days of Henry IV. occupied not the third part of its pre&s;ent &s;pace, and yet contained nearly the &s;ame number of inhabitants; and in London the hou&s;es are much larger, and the &s;treets wider, than before the great fire, 1666. There is al&s;o a remarkable alteration in point of diet. Formerly, people of rank lived on &s;alt meat the greater part of the year: at pre|&s;ent, fre&s;h meat is common all the year round. Pot|herbs and roots are now a con&s;iderable article of food: about London, in particular, the con&s;umption at the Revolution was not the &s;ixth part of what it is now. Add the great con&s;umption of tea and &s;ugar, which I am told by phy&s;icians to be no incon&s;iderable anti&s;eptics. But the chief cau&s;e of all is cleanline&s;s, which is grow|ing more and more univer&s;al, e&s;pecially in the city of London. In Con&s;tantinople, putrid di&s;ea&s;es reign as much as ever; not from unhealthine&s;s in the climate, but from the narrowne&s;s and na&s;tine&s;s of the &s;treets.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="13">
Thus it appears, that a ta&s;te for cleanne&s;s is in|herent in our nature. I &s;ay more: cleanline&s;s is evidently a branch of propriety, and con&s;equently a &s;elf-duty. The performance is rewarded with approbation; and the neglect is puni&s;hed with contempt<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, chap. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A ta&s;te for cleanne&s;s is not equally di&s;tributed among all men; nor indeed is any branch of the moral &s;en&s;e equally di&s;tributed: and if by nature one per&s;on be more cleanly than another, a whole nation may be &s;o. I judge that to be the ca&s;e of the Japane&s;e, &s;o finically clean as to find &s;ault even with the Dutch for dirtine&s;s. Their inns are not an exception, nor their little hou&s;es, in which wa|ter is always at hand for wa&s;hing after the opera|tion. I judged it to be al&s;o the ca&s;e of the Engli&s;h, who, high and low, rich and poor, are remarkable for cleanline&s;s all the world over; and I have often amu&s;ed my&s;elf with &s;o &s;ingular a re&s;emblance be|tween i&s;landers, removed at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from each other. But I was forc'd to abandon the re&s;emblance, upon a di&s;covery that the Engli&s;h have not always been &s;o cleanly as at pre&s;ent. Many centuries ago, as recorded in monki&s;h hi&s;|tory, one cau&s;e of the aver&s;ion the Engli&s;h had to the Danes, was their cleanline&s;s: they combed their hair, and put on a clean &s;hirt once a-week. And the celebrated Era&s;mus, who vi&s;ited England in the reign of Henry VIII. complains of the na&s;ti|ne&s;s and &s;lovenly habits of its people; a&s;cribing to that cau&s;e the frequent plagues which at that time
<PB N="10" REF="14">
infe&s;ted them. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Their floors,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are commonly of clay &s;trewed with ru&s;hes, under which lies unmole&s;ted a collection of beer, grea&s;e, fragments, bones, &s;pittle, excrements of dogs and cats, and of every thing that is nau&s;cous<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. 432.</NOTE>."</Q> A change &s;o extraordinary in the ta&s;te and manners of the Engli&s;h, rou&s;es our cu|rio&s;ity; and I &s;latter my&s;elf that the following cau&s;e will be &s;atisfactory. A &s;avage, remarkably indolent at home, tho' not in&s;en&s;ible of his dirtine&s;s, cannot rou&s;e up activity &s;ufficient to attempt a &s;erious pur|gation; and would be at a lo&s;s where to begin. The indu&s;trious, on the contrary, are improved in neatne&s;s and propriety by the art or manufacture that con&s;tantly employs them: they are never re|duced to purge the &s;table of Augeas; for being prone to action, they &s;uffer not dirt to re&s;t unmo|le&s;ted. Indu&s;trious nations accordingly, all the world over, are the mo&s;t cleanly. Arts and indu&s;|try had long flouri&s;hed in Holland, where Era&s;mus was born and educated: the people were clean above all their neighbours, becau&s;e they were in|du&s;trious above all their neighbours; and upon that account the dirtine&s;s of England could not fail to &s;trike a Hollander. At the period mentioned, in|du&s;try was as great a &s;tranger to England as clean|line&s;s: from which con&s;ideration, may it not fairly be inferred, that the Engli&s;h are indebted for their cleanline&s;s to the great progre&s;s of indu&s;try among them in later times? If this inference holds, it places indu&s;try in an amiable light. The Spaniards, who are indolent to a degree, are to this day as dirty as the Engli&s;h were formerly. Madrid, their capital, is nau&s;eou&s;ly na&s;ty: heaps of unmole&s;ted dirt in every &s;treet rai&s;e in that warm climate a pe&s;tiferous
<PB N="11" REF="15">
&s;team, which threatens to knock down every &s;tran|ger. A purgation was lately &s;et on foot by royal authority. But people habituated to dirt are not ea&s;ily reclaimed: to promote indu&s;try is the only effectual remedy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Till the year 1760, there was not a privy in Ma|drid, tho' it is plentifully &s;upplied with water. The ordure, during night, was thrown from the windows into the &s;treet, where it was gathered into heaps. By a royal proclamation, privies were ordered to be built. The inhabitants, tho' long accu&s;tomed to an arbitrary government, re&s;ented this proclamation as an infringe|ment of the common rights of mankind, and &s;truggled vigorou&s;ly again&s;t it. The phy&s;icians were the mo&s;t violent oppo&s;ers: they remon&s;trated, that if the filth was not thrown into the &s;treets, a fatal &s;ickne&s;s would en&s;ue; becau&s;e the putre&s;cent particles of air, which the filth attracted, would be imbibed by the human body.</NOTE>. The na&s;tine&s;s of the &s;treets of Li&s;bon before the late earthquake was intolerable; and &s;o is at pre&s;ent the na&s;tine&s;s of the &s;treets of Cadiz.</P>
<P>Tho' indu&s;try be the chief promoter of cleanli|ne&s;s, yet it is &s;eldom left to operate alone: other cau&s;es mix, &s;ome to accelerate the progre&s;s, &s;ome to retard it. The moi&s;ture of the Dutch climate has a con&s;iderable influence in promoting cleanli|ne&s;s; and joined with indu&s;try produces a &s;urpri&s;ing neatne&s;s and cleanline&s;s among people of bu&s;ine&s;s: men of figure and fa&s;hion, who generally re&s;ort to the Hague, the &s;eat of government, are not &s;o cleanly. On the other hand, the French are le&s;s cleanly than the Engli&s;h, tho' not le&s;s indu&s;trious. But the lower cla&s;&s;es of people, being in England more at their ea&s;e than in France, have a greater ta&s;te for living well, and in particular for keeping them&s;elves clean.</P>

A beard gives to the countenance a rough and fierce air, &s;uited to the manners of a rough and fierce people. The &s;ame face without a beard appears milder; for which rea&s;on, a beard becomes unfa&s;hionable in a poli&s;hed nation. Demo&s;thenes the orator lived in the &s;ame period with Alexander the Great, at which time the Greeks begun to leave off beards A bu&s;t however of that orator, found in Herculaneum, has a beard; which mu&s;t either have been done for him when he was young, or from reluctance in an old man to a new fa&s;hion. Barbers were brought to Rome from Sicily in the 454th year after the building of Rome. And it mu&s;t relate to the time following that period, what Aulus Gellius &s;ays<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lib. 3. cap. 4.</NOTE>, that people accu&s;ed of any crime were prohibited to &s;have their beards till they were ab&s;olved. From Hadrian, downward, the Roman Emperors wore beards. Julius Capitolinus reproaches the Emperor Verus for cutting his beard, at the in&s;tigation of a concubine. All the Roman generals wore beards in Ju&s;tinian's time<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Procopii Hi&s;toria Vandalica, lib. 2.</NOTE>. When the Pope &s;haved his beard, it was reckoned a ma|nife&s;t apo&s;ta&s;y by the Greek church; becau&s;e Mo&s;es and Je&s;us Chri&s;t were always drawn with beards by the Greek and Latin painters. Upon the dawn of &s;mooth manners in France, the beaus cut their beards into &s;hapes, and curled their whi&s;|kers. That fa&s;hion produced a whim&s;ical effect, viz. that men of gravity left off beards altogether: a beard in its natural &s;hape was too fierce, even for them; and they could not for &s;hame copy after the beaus.</P>

above. But it belongs to the pre&s;ent &s;ketch, con|&s;idered as a branch of external behaviour. Every part of external behaviour is influenced by temper and di&s;po&s;ition, and language more than any other part. In Elements of Critici&s;m<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. part 6.</NOTE> it is ob&s;erved, that an emotion in many in&s;tances bears a re&s;em|blance to its cau&s;e. The like holds univer&s;ally in all the natural &s;ounds prompted by pa&s;&s;ion. Let a pa&s;&s;ion be bold, rough, chearful, tender, or hum|ble, &s;till it holds, that the natural &s;ound prompted by it is in the &s;ame tone: and hence the rea&s;on why the&s;e natural &s;ounds are the &s;ame in all lan|guages. Some &s;light re&s;emblance of the &s;ame kind is di&s;coverable in many artificial &s;ounds. The language of a &s;avage is har&s;h; of polite people, &s;mooth; and of women, &s;oft and mu&s;ical. The tongues of &s;avage nations abound in gutturals, or in na&s;als; yet one would imagine that &s;uch words, pronounced with difficulty, would be avoided by &s;avages, as they are by children. But temper pre|vails, and &s;ugge&s;ts to &s;avages har&s;h &s;ounds, confor|formable to their roughne&s;s and cruelty. The E&s;quimaux have a language compo&s;ed of the har&s;h|e&s;t gutturals; and the tongues of the northern Eu|ropean nations are not remarkably more &s;mooth. The Scotch pea&s;ants are a frank and plain people; and their dialect is in the tone of their character. The Huron tongue hath &s;tateline&s;s and energy above mo&s;t known languages; and the Hurons &s;till retain a certain elevation of mind, which is more conformable to the maje&s;ty of their di&s;cour&s;e, than to their pre&s;ent low condition. Thus the manners of a people may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be gathered from their language. Nay, manners may frequently be gathered from &s;ingle words. The Hebrew word LECHOM &s;ignifies both food and fighting; and
<PB N="14" REF="18">
TEREPH &s;ignifies both food and plunder. KARAB &s;ignifies to draw near to one, and &s;ignifies al&s;o to fight. The Greek word LEIA, which &s;ignified originally, &s;poil procured by war or piracy, came to &s;ignify wealth. And the great variety of Greek words &s;ignifying good and better, &s;ignified originally &s;trong and violent.</P>
<P>Government, according to its different kinds, hath con&s;iderable influence in forming the tone of a language. Language in a democracy is commonly rough and coar&s;e; in a republic, manly and plain; in a monarchy, courteous and in&s;inuating; in de&s;|poti&s;m, imperious with re&s;pect to inferiors, and humble with re&s;pect to &s;uperiors. The govern|ment of the Greek empire is well repre&s;ented in Ju&s;tinian's edicts, termed Novellae Con&s;titutiones, the &s;tyle of which is &s;tiff, formal, and affectedly &s;tately; but de&s;titute of order, of force, and of ligament. About three centuries ago, Tu&s;cany was filled with &s;mall republics, who &s;poke a dialect manly and plain. Its rough tones were purged off when united under the Great Duke of Tu&s;cany; by which means the Tu&s;can dialect has arrived nearer to perfection than any other in Italy. The tone of the French language is well &s;uited to the nature of its government: every man is politely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to tho&s;e above him; and this tone forms the character of the language in general, &s;o as even to regulate the tone of the few who have occa&s;ion to &s;peak with authority. The freedom of the Eng|li&s;h government forms the manners of the people: the Engli&s;h language is accordingly more manly and nervous than the French, and abounds more with rough &s;ounds. The Lacedemonians of old, ap roud and au&s;tere people, affected to talk with brevity, in the tone of command more than of advice; and hence the Laconic &s;tyle, dry but ma&s;|culine. The Attic &s;tyle is more difficult to be
<PB N="15" REF="19">
accounted for: it was &s;weet and copious; and had a remarkable delicacy above the &s;tyle of any other nation. And yet the democracy of Athens produ|ced rough manners; witne&s;s the comedies of Ari&s;|tophanes, and the orations of E&s;chines and De|mo&s;thenes. We are not &s;o well acquainted with the Athenians as to account for the difference between their language and their manners: and are equally at a lo&s;s about the Ru&s;&s;ian tongue, which, not|with&s;tanding the barbarity of the people, is &s;mooth and &s;onorous. All that can be &s;aid is, that the operation of a general cau&s;e may be di&s;turbed by particular circum&s;tances. Languages re&s;emble the tides: the influence of the moon, which is the general cau&s;e of tides, is in &s;everal in&s;tances over|balanced by particular cau&s;es acting in oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>There may be ob&s;erved in &s;ome &s;avage tribes, a certain refinement of language that might do honour to a poli&s;hed people. The Canadians never give a man his proper name, in &s;peaking to him. If he be a relation, he is addre&s;&s;ed to in that quality: if a &s;tranger, the &s;peaker gives him &s;ome appellation that marks affection; &s;uch as, brother, cou&s;in, friend.</P>
<P>From &s;peech we advance to action. Man is na|turally prone to motion; witne&s;s children, who are never at re&s;t but when a&s;leep. Where rea&s;on go|verns, a man re&s;trains that re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, and never acts without a motive. Savages have few motives to action when the belly is full: their huts require little indu&s;try; and their covering of &s;kins, &s;till le&s;s. Hunting and fi&s;hing employ all their ac|tivity. After much fatigue in hunting, re&s;t is &s;weet; which the &s;avage prolongs, having no motive to action till the time of hunting returns. Savages ac|cordingly, like dogs, are extremely active in the

The &s;avages of the torrid zone are indolent above all others: they go naked; their huts co&s;t them no trouble; and they never hunt except for vegetables, which are their only food.

Not to talk of gold, &s;ilver was &s;carce in England during the reign of the third Edward. Rents were paid in kind; and what money they had was locked up in the coffers of the great barons. Pieces of plate were bequeathed even by kings of England, &s;o trifling in our e&s;timation, that a gentleman of a moderate fortune would be a&s;hamed to mention &s;uch in his will.</P>
<P>We next take under con&s;ideration the progre&s;s of &s;uch manners as are more peculiarly influenced by internal di&s;po&s;ition; preparing the reader by a general view, before entering into particulars. Man is by nature a timid animal, having little ability to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t harm: but he becomes bold in &s;ociety, and gives vent to pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t his ene|mies. In the hunter-&s;tate, the daily practice of &s;laughtering innocent animals for food, hardens men in cruelty: they are wor&s;e than bears or wolves, being cruel even to their own kind. The calm and &s;edentary life of a &s;hepherd tends to &s;often the har&s;h manners of hunters; and agriculture, requiring the union of many hands in one operation, in&s;pires a ta&s;te for mutual good offices. But here comes in the hoarding appetite to di&s;turb that au&s;picious commencement of civilization. Skilful hu&s;bandry, producing the nece&s;&s;aries of life in plenty, paves the way to arts and manufactures. Fine hou&s;es, &s;plen|did gardens, and rich apparel, are de&s;irable objects: the appetite for property becomes head&s;trong, and to obtain gratification tramples down every ob&s;tacle of ju&s;tice or honour<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See &s;ketch 3.</NOTE>. Differences ari&s;e, foment|ing di&s;cord and re&s;entment: war is rai&s;ed, even among tho&s;e of the &s;ame tribe; and while it was
<PB N="19" REF="23">
lawful for a man to take revenge at his own hand<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>, that fierce pa&s;&s;ion &s;wallowed up all others. Inequality of rank and fortune fo&s;tered di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;|&s;ions: witne&s;s pride in particular, which produced a cu&s;tom, once univer&s;al among barbarians, of kil|ling men, women, dogs, and hor&s;es, for &s;erving a dead chieftain in the other world. Such complica|tion of &s;elfi&s;h and &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions, tending eagerly to gratification, and rendering &s;ociety uncomforta|ble, cannot be &s;temmed by any human means other than whole&s;ome laws: a momentary ob&s;tacle in|flames de&s;ire; but perpetual re&s;traint deadens even the mo&s;t fervid pa&s;&s;ion. The authority of good government gave vigour to kindly affections; and appetite for &s;ociety, which acts ince&s;&s;antly, though not violently, gave a currency to mutual good offices. A circum&s;tance concurred to blunt the edge of di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions: the fir&s;t &s;ocieties were &s;mall; and &s;mall &s;tates in clo&s;e neighbourhood pro|duce di&s;cord and re&s;entment without end: the junc|tion of many &s;uch &s;tates into a great kingdom, re|move people farther from their enemies, and render them more gentle<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See this more fully handled, book 2. &s;ketch 1.</NOTE>. In that &s;ituation, men have lei&s;ure and &s;edatene&s;s to reli&s;h the comforts of &s;ocial life: they find that &s;elfi&s;h and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ubver&s;ive of &s;ociety; and through fondne&s;s for &s;ociety, they patiently undergo the &s;evere di&s;cipline of re&s;training pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;moothing manners. Violent pa&s;&s;ions that di&s;turb the peace of &s;ociety have &s;ub&s;ided, and are now &s;eldom heard of: hu|manity is in fa&s;hion, and &s;ocial affections prevail. Men improve in urbanity by conver&s;ing with wo|men; and however &s;elfi&s;h at heart, they conciliate favour, by a&s;&s;uming an air of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. Selfi&s;hne&s;s thus refined becomes an effectual cau&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="24">
of civilization. But what follows? Turbulent and violent pa&s;&s;ions are buried, never again to revive; leaving the mind totally ingro&s;&s;ed by &s;elf-intere&s;t. In the original &s;tate of hunters and fi&s;hers, there being little connection among individuals, every min minds his own concerns, and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s governs. The di&s;covery that hunting and fi&s;hing are be&s;t car|ried on in company, promotes &s;ome degree of &s;ociety in that &s;tate: it gains ground in the &s;hepherd-&s;tate, and makes a capital figure where hu&s;bandry and commerce flouri&s;h. Private concord is promoted by &s;ocial affection; and a nation is pro&s;perous in proportion as the amor patriae prevails. But wealth, acquired whether by conque&s;t or commerce, is pro|ductive of luxury and &s;en&s;uality. As the&s;e increa&s;e, &s;ocial affections decline, and at la&s;t vani&s;h. This is vi&s;ible in every opulent city that has long flouri&s;h|ed in exten&s;ive commerce. Selfi&s;hne&s;s becomes the ruling pa&s;&s;ion: friend&s;hip is no more; and even blood-relation is little regarded. Every man &s;tudies his own intere&s;t; and love of gain and of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure are idols wor&s;hipped by all. And thus in the progre&s;s of manners, men end as they begun: &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is no le&s;s eminent in the la&s;t and mo&s;t po|li&s;hed &s;tate of &s;ociety, than in the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;avage &s;tate.</P>
<P>From a general view of the progre&s;s of manners, we de&s;cend to particulars. And the fir&s;t &s;cene that pre&s;ents it&s;elf is, cruelty to &s;trangers, extended in proce&s;s of time again&s;t members of the &s;ame tribe. Anger and re&s;entment are predominant in &s;avages, who never think of &s;mothering pa&s;&s;ion. But this character is not univer&s;al: &s;ome tribes are remark|able for humanity, as mentioned in the fir&s;t &s;ketch. Anger and re&s;entment formed the character of our European ance&s;tors, and made them fierce and cruel. The Goths were &s;o prone to blood, that in their fir&s;t inroads into the Roman territories they
<PB N="21" REF="25">
ma&s;&s;acred man, woman, and child. Procopius re|ports, that in one of the&s;e inroads they left Italy thin of inhabitants. They were however an hone&s;t people; and by the poli&s;h they received in the civilized parts of Europe, they became no le&s;s re|markable for humanity, than formerly for cruelty. Totila, their king, having ma&s;tered Rome after a long and bloody &s;iege, permitted not a &s;ingle per&s;on to be killed in cold blood, nor the cha&s;tity of any woman to be attempted. One cannot without hor|ror think of the wanton cruelties exerci&s;ed by the Tartars again&s;t the nations invaded by them under Gengizcan and Timor Bec.</P>
<P>A Scythian, &s;ays Herodotus, pre&s;ents the king with the heads of the enemies he has killed in bat|tle; and the man who brings not a head, gets no &s;hare of the plunder. He adds, that many Scythi|ans clothe them&s;elves with the &s;kins of men, and make u&s;e of the &s;culls of their enemies to drink out of. Diodorus Siculus reports of the Gauls, that they carry home the heads of their enemies &s;lain in battle: and after embalming them, depo&s;it them in che&s;ts as their chief trophy; bragging of the &s;ums offered for the&s;e heads by the friends of the decea&s;|ed, and refu&s;ed. In &s;imilar circum&s;tances men are the &s;ame all the world over. The &s;calping of ene|mies, in daily u&s;e among the North-American &s;avages, is equally cruel and barbarous.</P>
<P>No &s;avages are more cruel than the Greeks and Trojans were, as de&s;cribed by Homer; men butch|ered in cold blood, towns reduced to a&s;hes, &s;overeigns expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t humbling indignities, no re&s;pect paid to age nor to &s;ex. The young Adra&s;tus<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Book 6. of the Iliad.</NOTE>, thrown from his car, and lying on his face in the du&s;t, obtained quarter from Menelaus.

Hector, having &s;tripped Patroclus of his arms, drags the &s;lain along, vowing to lop the head from the trunk, and to give the mangled cor&s;e a prey to the dogs of Troy. And the &s;eventeenth book of the Iliad is wholly employed in de&s;cribing the conte&s;t about the body between the Greeks and Trojans. Be&s;ide the brutality of preventing the la&s;t duties from being performed to a dead friend, it is a low &s;cene, un|worthy of heroes. It was equally brutal in Achilles to drag the cor&s;e of Hector to the &s;hips, tied to his car. In a &s;cene between Hector and Andromache<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Iliad, book 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>, the treatment of vanqui&s;hed enemies is pathe|tically de&s;cribed; &s;overeigns ma&s;&s;acred, and their bodies left a prey to dogs and vultures; &s;ucking in|fants da&s;hed again&s;t the pavement; ladies of the fir&s;t rank forced to perform the lowe&s;t acts of &s;lavery. Hector doth not di&s;&s;emble, that if Troy were con|quered, his poor wife would be condemned to draw water like the vile&s;t &s;lave. Hecuba, in Euripides, laments, that &s;he was chained like a dog at Aga|memnon's gate; and the &s;ame &s;avage manners are de&s;cribed in many other Greek tragedies. Prome|thus makes free with the heavenly fire, in order to give life to man. As a puni&s;hment for bringing rational creatures into exi&s;tence, the gods decree, that he be chained to a rock, and abandoned to birds of prey. Vulcan is introduced by E&s;chylus rattling the chain, nailing one end to a rock, and the other to the brea&s;t-bone of the criminal. Who but an American &s;avage can at pre&s;ent behold &s;uch a &s;pec|tacle and not be &s;hocked at it? A &s;cene repre&s;enting
<PB N="23" REF="27">
a woman murdered by her children, would be hi&s;&s;ed by every modern audience; and yet that horrid &s;cene was repre&s;ented with applau&s;e in the Electra of Sophocles. Stoboeus reports a &s;aying of Menan|der, that even the gods cannot in&s;pire a &s;oldier with civility: no wonder that the Greek &s;oldiers were brutes and barbarians, when war was waged, not only again&s;t the &s;tate, but again&s;t every individual. At pre&s;ent, humanity prevails among &s;oldiers as among others; becau&s;e we make war only again&s;t a &s;tate, not again&s;t individuals. The Greeks are the le&s;s excu&s;able for their cruelty, as they appear to have been &s;en&s;ible that humanity is a cardinal virtue. Barbarians are always painted by Homer as cruel; poli&s;hed nations as tender and compa&s;|&s;ionate:<Q><L>" Ye gods! (he cried) upon what barren coa&s;t,</L>
<L>" In what new regions is Uly&s;&s;es to&s;t;</L>
<L>" Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by wild barbarians fierce in arms,</L>
<L>" Or men who&s;e bo&s;om tender pity warms?"</L>
<BIBL>ODYSSEY, book 13. 241.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Cruelty is incon&s;i&s;tent with true heroi&s;m; and accordingly very little of the latter is di&s;coverable in any of Homer's warriors. So much did they retain of the &s;avage character, as, even without blu&s;hing, to fly from an enemy &s;uperior in bodily &s;trength. Diomedes, who makes an illu&s;trious figure in the fifth book of the Iliad, retires when Hector ap|pears: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Diomedes beheld the chief, and &s;huddered to his inmo&s;t &s;oul."</Q> Antilochus, &s;on of Ne&s;tor, having &s;lain Melanippus<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Book 15.</NOTE>, ru&s;hed forward, eager to &s;eize his bright arms. But &s;eeing Hector, he fled like a bea&s;t of prey who &s;huns the gathering hinds. And the great Hector him&s;elf &s;hamefully
<PB N="24" REF="28">
turns his back upon the near approach of Achilles: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Periphetes, endowed with every virtue, renown|ed in the race, great in war, in prudence excel|ling his fellows, gave glory to Hector, covering the chief with renown."</Q> One would expect a fierce combat between the&s;e two bold warriors. Not &s;o. Periphetes &s;tumbling, fell to the ground; and Hector was not a&s;hamed to transfix with his &s;pear the unre&s;i&s;ting hero.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame tone of character, nothing is more common among Homer's warriors than to in&s;ult a vanqui&s;hed foe. Patroclus, having beat Cebriones to the ground with a huge &s;tone, derides his fall in the following words.<Q><L>" Good heav'ns! what active feats yon arti&s;t &s;hows,</L>
<L>" What &s;kilful divers are our Phrygian foes!</L>
<L>" Mark with what ea&s;e they &s;ink into the &s;and.</L>
<L>" Pity! that all their practice is by land."</L></Q> The Greeks are repre&s;ented<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Book 22.</NOTE> one after another &s;tabbing the dead body of Hector: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nor &s;tood an Argive near the chief who inflicted not a wound. Surely now, &s;aid they, more ea&s;y of acce&s;s is Hector, than when he launched on the &s;hips brands of devouring fire."</Q></P>
<P>When &s;uch were the manners of warriors at the &s;iege of Troy, it is no wonder that the heroes on both &s;ides were not le&s;s intent on &s;tripping the &s;lain than on victory. They are every where repre&s;ent|ed as greedy of &s;poil.</P>
<P>The Jews did not yield to the Greeks in cruelty. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to give in&s;tances, as the hi&s;torical books of the Old Te&s;tament are in the hands of every one. I &s;hall &s;elect one in&s;tance for a &s;peci|men,
<PB N="25" REF="29">
dreadfully cruel without any ju&s;t provocation: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought again&s;t it, and took it.

<P>That cruelty was predominant among the Ro|mans is evident from every one of their hi&s;torians. Brutality to their offspring was con&s;picuous. Chil|dren were held, like cattle, to be the father's pro|perty: and &s;o tenacious was the patria pote&s;tas, that if a &s;on or daughter &s;old to be a &s;lave was &s;et free, he or &s;he fell again under the father s power, to be &s;old a &s;econd time, and even a third time. The power of life and death over children was much le&s;s unnatural, while no public tribunal exi&s;ted for puni&s;hing crimes. A &s;on, being a &s;lave, could have no property of his own.

When law became a lucrative profe&s;&s;ion, what a &s;on gained in that way was declared to be his property.

without pity or remor&s;e. Antony, having ordered Cicero to be beheaded, and the head to be brought to him, viewed it with &s;avage plea&s;ure. His wife Fulvia laid hold of it, &s;truck it on the face, uttered many bitter execrations, and having placed it be|tween her knees, drew out the tongue, and pierced it with a bodkin. The delight it gave the Romans to &s;ee wild bea&s;ts &s;et loo&s;e again&s;t one another in their circus, is a proof not at all ambiguous of their ta&s;te for blood, even at the time of their highe&s;t civilization. The Edile Scaurus &s;ent at one time to Rome 150 panthers, Pompey 410, and Augu&s;tus 410, for the public &s;pectacles. Their gladiatorian combats are not &s;o clear a proof of their ferocity: the courage and addre&s;s exerted in the&s;e combats gave a manly plea&s;ure that balanced in &s;ome mea|&s;ure the pain of &s;eeing the&s;e poor fellows cut and &s;la&s;h one another. And that the Romans were ne|ver cured of their itch for blood, appears from Caligula, Nero, and many other mon&s;ters, who governed the Romans from Augu&s;tus downward. There is no example in modern times of &s;uch mon|&s;ters in France, though an ab&s;olute monarchy, nor even in Turky.</P>
<P>Ferocity was in the Roman empire con&s;iderably mollified by literature and other fine arts; but it acquired new vigour upon the irruption of the bar|barous nations who cru&s;hed that empire. In the year 559, Clotaire, King of the Franks, burnt alive his &s;on, with all his friends, becau&s;e they had rebelled again&s;t him. Queen Brunehaud being, by Clotaire II. condemned to die, was dragged through the camp at a hor&s;e's tail till &s;he gave up the gho&s;t. The ferocity of European nations became altogether intolerable during the anarchy of the feudal &s;y&s;tem. Many pea&s;ants in the northern provinces of France being &s;orely oppre&s;&s;ed in civil wars carried on by the nobles again&s;t each other, turned de&s;perate,

gathered together in bodies, re&s;olving to extirpate all the nobles. A party of them, anno 1358, forced open the ca&s;tle of a knight, hung him up upon a gal|lows, violated in his pre&s;ence his wife and daughters, roa&s;ted him upon a &s;pit, compelled his wife and children to eat of his fle&s;h, and terminated that hor|rid &s;cene with ma&s;&s;acring the whole family, and burning the ca&s;tle. When they were a&s;hed, &s;ays Froi&s;&s;ard, why they committed &s;uch abominable actions, their an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they did as they &s;aw others do; and that all the nobles in the world ought to be de&s;troyed."</Q> The nobles, when they got the upper hand, were equally cruel. They put all to fire and &s;word; and ma&s;&s;acred eve|ry pea&s;ant who came in the way, without troubling them&s;elves to &s;eparate the innocent from the guilty. The Count de Ligny encouraged his nephew, a boy of fifteen, to kill with his own hand &s;ome pri|&s;oners who were his countrymen; in which, &s;ays Mon&s;trelet, the young man took great delight. How much wor&s;e than brutal mu&s;t have been the manners of that age! for even a bea&s;t of prey kills not but when in&s;tigated by hunger. The third act, of &s;tealing from the lead-mines in Derby, was, by a law of Edward I. puni&s;hed in the following man|ner: A hand of the criminal was nailed to a table; and in that &s;tate he was left without meat or drink, having no means for freedom but to employ the one hand to cut off the other. The barbarity of the Eng|li&s;h at that period made &s;evere puni&s;hments nece&s;|&s;arary: but the puni&s;hment mentioned goes beyond &s;everity; it is brutal cruelty. The barbarous treat|ment of the Jews, during the dark ages of Chri&s;ti|anity, gives pregnant evidence, that Chri&s;tians were not &s;hort of Pagans in cruelty. Poi&s;on and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination were mo&s;t licentiou&s;ly perpetrated, no farther back than the la&s;t century. Some pious men made vigorous efforts in more than one general

<P>I wi&s;h to &s;often the foregoing &s;cene: it may be &s;oftened a little. Among barbarians, puni&s;hments mu&s;t be &s;anguinary; as their bodies only are &s;en&s;i|ble of pain, not their minds.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of arts and &s;ciences in Europe, followed with a reformation in religion, had a won|derful effect in &s;weetening manners, and promoting the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. Of all crimes high trea&s;on is the mo&s;t involved in circum&s;tances, and upon that account the mo&s;t difficult to be defined or cir|cum&s;cribed: at the &s;ame time, the influence of government upon its judges &s;eldom permits a fair trial. And yet, for that crime are re&s;erved the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments. In England, the puni&s;hment is, to cut up the criminal alive, to tear out his heart, to da&s;h it about his ears, and to throw it into the flames. The &s;ame puni&s;hment continues in form, not in reality: the heart indeed is torn out, but not till the criminal is &s;trangled. Even the virulence of religious zeal is con&s;iderably abated. Savonarola was condemned to the flames as an impious impo&s;tor; but he was fir&s;t privately &s;trangled. The fine arts, which humanize man|ners, were in Italy at that time accelerating toward

perfection. The famous Latimer was in England condemned to be burnt for here&s;y: but bags of gun|powder were put under his arms, that he might be burnt with the lea&s;t pain. Even Knox, a violent Scotch reformer, acknowledges, that Wi&s;hart was &s;trangled before he was thrown into the flames for here&s;y. So bitter was the late per&s;ecution again&s;t the Je&s;uits, that not only were their per&s;ons pro|&s;cribed, but in many places their books, not even excepting books upon mathematics, and other ab|&s;tract &s;ubjects. That per&s;ecution re&s;embled in ma|ny particulars the per&s;ecution again&s;t the knights|templars: fifty-nine of the latter were burnt alive: the former were really le&s;s innocent; and yet &s;uch humanity prevails at pre&s;ent, that not a drop of Je&s;uit-blood has been &s;hed. A bankrupt in Scot|land, if he has not &s;uffered by unavoidable misfor|tune, is by law condemned to wear a party-coloured garment. That law is not now put in execution, unle&s;s where a bankrupt de&s;erves to be &s;tigmatized for his culpable mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>Whether the following late in&s;tance of barbarity does not equal any of tho&s;e above mentioned, I leave to my readers. No traveller who vi&s;ited Peter&s;burgh during the reign of the Empre&s;s Elizabeth can be ignorant of Madam Lapouchin, the great ornament of that court. Her intimacy with a foreign amba&s;|&s;ador having brought her under &s;u&s;picion of plotting with him again&s;t the government, &s;he was con|demned to undergo the puni&s;hment of the knout. At the place of execution &s;he appeared in a genteel undre&s;s, which heightened her beauty. Of what|ever indi&s;cretion &s;he might have been guilty, the &s;weetne&s;s of her countenance, and her compo&s;ure, left not in the &s;pectators the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of guilt. Her youth al&s;o, her beauty, her life and &s;pirit pleaded for her.&mdash;But all in vain: &s;he was de&s;erted by all, and abandoned to &s;urly execution|ers;

whom &s;he beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;eeming to doubt whether &s;uch preparations were intended for her. The cloak that covered her bo&s;om being pulled off, mode&s;ty took the alarm, and made her &s;tart back: &s;he turned pale, and bur&s;t into tears. One of the executioners &s;tripped her naked to the wai&s;t, &s;eized her by both hands, and threw her on his back, rai&s;ing her &s;ome inches from the ground. The other executioner laying hold of her delicate limbs with his rough fi&s;ts, put her in a po&s;ture for receiving the puni&s;hment. Then laying hold of the knout, a &s;ort of whip made of a leathern &s;trap, he retreated a few &s;teps, and with a &s;ingle &s;troke tore off a &s;lip of &s;kin from the neck downward, re|peating his &s;trokes till all the &s;kin of her back was cut off in &s;mall &s;lips.

<P>Rough and har&s;h manners produced &s;lavery; and &s;lavery &s;o&s;tered rough and har&s;h manners, by giving them con&s;tant exerci&s;e. The brutality of the Spartans to the Helots, their &s;laves, is a reproach to the human &s;pecies. Be&s;ide the har&s;h|e&s;t u&s;age, they were prevented from multiplying by downright murder and ma&s;&s;acre. Why did not &s;uch barbarity render the Spartans dete&s;table, in|&s;tead of being re&s;pected by their neighbours, as the mo&s;t virtuous people in Greece? There can be but one rea&s;on, that the Greeks were all of them cruel, the Spartans a little more, perhaps, than the re&s;t. In Rome, a &s;lave, chained at the gate of every great hou&s;e, gave admittance to the gue&s;ts invited to a fea&s;t: could any but barbarians bear &s;uch a &s;pectacle without pain? If a Roman citizen was found murdered in his own hou&s;e, his whole hou&s;ehold-&s;laves, perhaps two or three hundred, were put to death without mercy, unle&s;s they could detect the murderer. Such a law, cruel and unju&s;t, could never have been enacted among a people of any humanity.</P>

&s;uch criminals perpetually in view would harden the hearts of the &s;pectators, and eradicate pity, a capital moral pa&s;&s;ion. Behold the behaviour of the Dutch, in the I&s;land of Amboyna. A native who is found guilty of theft is deprived of his ears and no&s;e, and made a &s;lave for life. William Funnel, who was there anno 1705, reports, that five hun|dred of the&s;e wretches were &s;ecured in pri&s;on, and never &s;uffered to go abroad, but in order to &s;aw timber, to cut &s;tone, or to carry heavy burdens. Their food is a pittance of coar&s;e rice, boiled in water, and their bed the hard ground. What is &s;till wor&s;e, poor people, who happen to run in debt, are turned over to the &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India company, who &s;end them to work among their &s;laves, with a daily allowance of two pence, which goes to the creditor. A nation mu&s;t be de|void of bowels, who can e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch inhumanity by law. But time has rendered that practice fami|liar to the Dutch, &s;o as to behold, with ab&s;olute indifference, the multiplied mi&s;eries of their fellow|creatures. It appears, indeed, that &s;uch a puni&s;h|ment would be more effectual than death, to re|pre&s;s theft; but can any one doubt, that &s;ociety would &s;uffer more by eradicating pity and humani|ty, than it would gain by removing every one by death who is guilty of theft? At the &s;ame time, the Dutch, however cruel to the natives, are ex|tremely complai&s;ant to one another: &s;eldom is any one of them puni&s;hed but for murder: a &s;mall &s;um will procure pardon for any other crime.</P>
<P>A degree of coar&s;ene&s;s and indelicacy is connect|ed with rough manners. The manners of the Greeks, as copied by Plautus and Terence, from Menander and other Greek writers, were extreme|ly coar&s;e; &s;uch as may be expected in a people living among their &s;laves, without any &s;ociety with virtuous women. The behaviour of Demo&s;thenes
<PB N="36" REF="40">
and E&s;chines to each other, in their public ha|rangues, is woefully coar&s;e. But Athens was a de|mocracy; and a democracy, above all other go|vernments, is rough and licentious. In the Athe|nian comedy, neither gods nor men are &s;pared. The mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons of the republic are ridiculed by name, in the comedies of Ari&s;topha|nes, which wallow in loo&s;ene&s;s and detraction. In the third act of Andromach&eacute;, a tragedy of Euri|pides, Peleus and Menelaus, Kings of The&s;&s;aly and Sparta, fall into downright ribaldry; Mene|laus &s;wearing that he would not give up his vic|tim, and Peleus threatening to knock him down with his &s;taff. The manners of Ja&s;on, in the tra|gedy of Medea by Euripides, are woefully indeli|cate. With unparalleled gratitude to his wife Medea, he, in her pre&s;ence, makes love to the King of Corinth's daughter, and obtains her in marriage. In&s;tead of &s;hunning a per&s;on he had &s;o deeply injured, he endeavours to excu&s;e him&s;elf to her in a very &s;neaking manner, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he was an exile like her&s;elf, without &s;upport; and that his marriage would acquire powerful friends to them and to their children."</Q> Could he imagine, that &s;uch frigid rea&s;ons would touch a woman of any &s;pirit?

How woefully indelicate mu&s;t the man have been, who could &s;it down gravely to compo&s;e &s;uch a piece! and how di&s;&s;olute mu&s;t the &s;pectators have been, who could behold &s;uch a &s;cene without hi&s;&s;ing! Next to the indecency of expo&s;ing one's nudities in good company, is the talking of them without re&s;erve. Horace is extremely ob&s;cene, and Martial no le&s;s. But I

<P>The manners of Europe, before the revival of letters, were no le&s;s coar&s;e than cruel. In the Car|tularies of Charlemagne, judges are forbid to hold courts but in the morning, with an empty &s;tomach. It would appear, that men in tho&s;e days were not a&s;hamed to be &s;een drunk, even in a court of ju&s;tice. It was cu&s;tomary, both in France and Italy, to collect for &s;port all the &s;trumpets in the neighbourhood, and to make them run races. Se|veral feudal tenures give evidence of manners both low and coar&s;e. Struvius mentions a tenure, bind|ing the va&s;&s;al, on the birth-day of his lord, to dance and fart before him. The cod-piece, which, a few centuries ago, made part of a man's dre&s;s, and which &s;welled, by degrees, to a mon&s;trous &s;ize, te&s;tifies &s;hamefully-coar&s;e manners; and yet it was a mode&s;t ornament, compared with one u&s;ed in France, during the reign of Lewis XI. which was the figure of a man's privy parts worn upon the coat or breeches. In the &s;ame period, the Judge|ment of Paris was a favourite theatrical entertain|ment: three women, &s;tark-naked, repre&s;ented the three godde&s;&s;es, Juno, Venus, and Minerva. Nick-names, &s;o common not long ago, are an in&s;tance of the &s;ame coar&s;ene&s;s of manners; for to fix a nick-name on a man, is to u&s;e him with con|temptuous familiarity. In the thirteenth century, many clergymen refu&s;ed to admini&s;ter the &s;acra|ment

<P>Swearing, as an expletive of &s;peech, is a violent &s;ymptom of rough and coar&s;e manners. Such &s;wearing prevails among all barbarous nations. Even women in Plautus &s;wear fluently. Swearing prevailed in Spain and in France, till it was bani&s;h|ed by polite manners. Our Queen Elizabeth was a bold &s;wearer; and the Engli&s;h populace, who are rough beyond their neighbours, are noted by &s;tran|gers for that vice. Tho' &s;wearing, in order to en|force an expre&s;&s;ion, is not in it&s;elf immoral; it is, however, hurtful in its con&s;equences, rendering &s;acred names too familiar. God's-beard, the com|mon oath of William Rufus, &s;ugge&s;ts an image of our Maker as an old man with a long beard. In vain have acts of parliament been made again&s;t &s;wearing: it is ea&s;y to evade the penalty, by coin|ing new oaths; and as that vice proceeds from an over&s;low of &s;pirits, people in that condition brave penalties. Poli&s;hed manners are the only effectual cure for that malady.</P>
<P>When a people begin to emerge out of barba|rity, loud mirth and rough jokes come in place of rancour and re&s;entment. About a century ago, it was u&s;ual for the &s;ervants and retainers of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in Scotland, to break out into riotous mirth and uproar the la&s;t day of every term, throw|ing bags, du&s;t, &s;and, or &s;tones, all around. We have undoubted evidence of that di&s;orderly practice from an act of the court, prohibiting it under a &s;evere penalty, as di&s;honourable to the court,

of the king's court, of his palace, and of the public buildings. But, with the &s;ame breath, he de&s;cribes Nau&s;icaa, the king's daughter, tra|velling to the river on a waggon of grea&s;y cloaths, to be wa&s;hed there by her and her maids. Po&s;|&s;ibly it will be urged that &s;uch circum&s;tances, however low in our opinion, might appear other|wi&s;e to the Greeks. If they had appeared low to the Greeks, they would not have been introduced by their greate&s;t poet. But what does this prove, other than that the Greeks were low in their man|ners? Their manners did not corre&s;pond to the delicacy of their ta&s;te in the fine arts. Nor can it be expected that they &s;hould corre&s;pond, when the Greeks were &s;trangers to that polite &s;ociety with women, which refines behaviour, and elevates manners. The fir&s;t kings in Greece, as Thucy|dides ob&s;erves, were elective, having no power but to command their armies in time of war; which re&s;embles the government that obtains at pre&s;ent in the I&s;thmus of Darien. They had no written laws, being governed by cu&s;tom merely. To live by plunder was held honourable; for it was their opinion, that the rules of ju&s;tice are not intended for re&s;training the powerful. All &s;tran|gers were accounted enemies, as among the Ro|mans; and inns were unknown, becau&s;e people lived at home, having very little intercour&s;e even with tho&s;e of their own nation. Inns were un|known in Germany; and to this day are unknown in the remote parts of the Highlands of Scotland; but for an oppo&s;ite rea&s;on, that ho&s;pitality prevail|ed greatly among the ancient Germans, and con|tinues to prevail &s;o much among our Highlanders, that a gentleman takes it for an affront, if a &s;tran|ger pa&s;s his hou&s;e.

kings had a wre&s;tling-match. Had they forgot that they were &s;overeign princes?</P>
<P>One would imagine war to be a &s;oil too rough for the growth of civilization; and yet it is not always an unkindly &s;oil. War between two &s;mall tribes is fierce and cruel: but a large &s;tate mitigates re&s;entment, by directing it, not again&s;t individuals, but again&s;t the &s;tate in general. We know no enemies but tho&s;e who are in arms: we have no re&s;entment again&s;t others, but rather find a plea|&s;ure in treating them with humanity. Barbarity and cruelty, having thus in war few individuals for their objects, naturally &s;ub&s;ide; and magnanimity in their &s;tead transforms &s;oliders from brutes to heroes. Some time ago, it was u&s;ual in France to demand battle; and it was held di&s;honourable to decline it, however unequal the match. Here was heroi&s;m without prudence; but in all reformations it is natural to go from one extreme to the other. While the King of England held any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in France, war was perpetual between the two nations, which was commonly carried on with more magnanimity than is u&s;ual between inveterate ene|mies. It became cu&s;tomary to give pri&s;oners their freedom, upon a &s;imple parole to return with their ran&s;om at a day named. The &s;ame was the cu&s;tom in the border-wars between the Engli&s;h and Scots, before their union under one monarch. Both par|ties found their account equally in &s;uch honourable behaviour. Edward Prince of Wales, in a pitched battle again&s;t the French, took the illu&s;trious Ber|trand du Gue&s;clin pri&s;oner. He long declined to accept a ran&s;om; but finding it whi&s;pered that he was afraid of that hero, he in&s;tantly &s;et him at li|berty without a ran&s;om. This may be deemed im|politic or whim&s;ical: but is love of glory le&s;s prai&s;e|worthy than love of conque&s;t? The Duke of Gui&s;e, victor in the battle of Dreux, re&s;ted all night in the
<PB N="43" REF="47">
field of battle; and gave the Prince of Conde, his pri&s;oner, a &s;hare of his bed, where they lay like brothers. The Chevalier Bayard, commander of a French army, anno 1524, being mortally wound|ed in retreating from the Imperiali&s;ts, placed him|&s;elf under a tree, his face however to the enemy. The Marquis de Pe&s;cara, General of the Imperial forces, finding him dead in that po&s;ture, behaved with the genero&s;ity of a gallant adver&s;ary: he di|rected his body to be embalmed, and to be &s;ent to his relations in the mo&s;t honourable manner. Mag|nanimity and heroi&s;m, in which benevolence is an e&s;&s;ential ingredient, are incon&s;i&s;tent with cruelty, per&s;idy, or any groveling pa&s;&s;ion. Never was gal|lantry in war carried to a greater height, than be|tween the Engli&s;h and Scotch borderers before the crowns were united. The night after the battle of Otterburn, the victors and vanqui&s;hed lay promi&s;|cuou&s;ly in the &s;ame camp, without apprehending the lea&s;t danger one from the other. The manners of ancient warriors were very different. Homer's hero, tho' &s;uperior to all in bodily &s;trength, takes every advantage of his enemy; and never feels either compa&s;&s;ion or remor&s;e. The politic of the Greeks and Romans in war, was to weaken the &s;tate by plundering its territory, and de&s;troying its people. Humanity with us prevails even in war. Individuals not in arms are &s;ecure, which &s;aves much innocent blood. Pri&s;oners were &s;et at liberty upon paying a ran&s;om; and by later improvements in manners, even that practice is left off, as too mercantile, a more honourable practice being &s;ub|&s;tituted, viz. a cartel for exchange of pri&s;oners. Humanity was carried to a &s;till greater height, in our late war with France, by an agreement between the Duke de Noailles and the Earl of Stair, That the ho&s;pitals for the &s;ick and wounded &s;oldiers &s;hould be &s;ecure from all ho&s;tilities. The humanity of the
<PB N="44" REF="48">
Duke de Randan, in the &s;ame war, makes an illu&s;|trious figure even in the pre&s;ent age, remarkable for humanity to enemies. When the French troops were compelled to abandon their conque&s;ts in the electorate of Hanover, their Generals every where burnt their magazines, and plundered the people. The Duke de Randan, who commanded in the city of Hanover, put the magi&s;trates in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his magazines, reque&s;ting them to di&s;tribute the contents among the poor; and he was be&s;ide ex|tremely vigilant to prevent his &s;oldiers from com|mitting acts of violence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such kindline&s;s in an enemy from whom nothing is expected but mi&s;chief, is an illu&s;trious in&s;tance of hu|manity And a &s;imilar in&s;tance will not make the le&s;s figure that it was done by a man of inferior rank. When Mon&s;. Thurot, during our late war with France; ap|peared on the coa&s;t of Scotland with three armed ve&s;|&s;els, the terror he at fir&s;t &s;pread &s;oon yielded to admi|ration in&s;pired by his humanity. He paid a rull price for every thing he wanted; and in general behaved with &s;o much affability, that a countryman ventured to com|plain to him of an officer who had taken from him fifty or &s;ixty guineas. The officer acknowledged the fact; but &s;aid, that he had divided the money among his men. Thurot ordered the officer to give his bill for the money, which, he &s;aid, &s;hould be &s;topped out of his pay, if they were &s;o fortunate as to return to France. Com|pare this incident with that of the great Scipio, celebra|ted in Roman &s;tory, who re&s;tored a beautiful bride to the bridegroom, and it will not &s;uffer by the compari&s;on. Another in&s;tance is no le&s;s remarkable. One of his of|ficers gave a bill upon a merchant in France, for the price of provi&s;ions purcha&s;ed by him. Thurot having accidentally &s;een the bill, informed the countryman that it was of no value, reprimanded the officer bitterly for the cheat, and compelled him to give a bill upon a mer|chant who he knew would pay the money. At that very time, Thurot's men were in bad humour, and were di&s;po&s;ed to mutiny. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, would not Thurot have been excu&s;ed, for winking at a fraud to which he was not acce&s;&s;ary? But he acted all along with the &s;tricte&s;t honour, even at the hazard of a mutiny. Common hone&s;ty to an enemy is not a common practice in war. Thurot was &s;trictly hone&s;t in circum&s;tances that made the exertion of common hone&s;ty an act of the highe&s;t magnanimity. The&s;e incidents ought to be held up to princes as examples of true heroi&s;m. War carried on in that manner would, from de&s;olation and horror, be converted into a fair-field for acquiring true military glory, and for exerci&s;ing every manly virtue. I feel the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction in paying this tribute of prai&s;e to the memory of that great man. He will be kept in remembrance by every true-hearted Briton. tho' he died fighting again&s;t us But he died in the field of honour, fighting for his country.</NOTE>. The nece&s;&s;ity of fortify|ing
<PB N="45" REF="49">
towns to guard from de&s;truction the innocent and defencele&s;s, affords convincing evidence of the &s;avage cruelty that prevailed in former times. By the growth of humanity, &s;uch fortifications have become le&s;s frequent; and they &s;erve no purpo&s;e at pre&s;ent but to defend again&s;t inva&s;ion; in which view a &s;mall fortification, if but &s;ufficient for the garri&s;on, is greatly preferable; being con&s;tructed at a much le&s;s expence, and having no mouths to provide for but the garri&s;on only.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of &s;ociety there is commonly a re|markable period, when &s;ocial and di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions &s;eem to bear equal &s;way, prevailing alternately. In the hi&s;tory of Alexander's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, there are fre|quent in&s;tances of cruelty, equalling that of Ameri|can &s;avages; and in&s;tances no le&s;s frequent of gra|titude, of genero&s;ity, and even of clemency, that betoken manners highly poli&s;hed. Ptolemy of Egypt, having gained a complete victory over De|metrius, &s;on of Antigonus, re&s;tored to him his equipage, his friends, and his dome&s;tics, &s;aying,
<PB N="46" REF="50">
that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they ought not to make war for plunder, but for glory."</Q> Demetrius having defeated one of Ptolemy's Generals, was le&s;s delighted with the victory, than with the opportunity of rivalling his antagoni&s;t in humanity. The &s;ame Demetrius having re&s;tored liberty to the Athenians, was treat|ed by them as a demi-god; and yet afterward, in his adver&s;ity, their gates were &s;hut again&s;t him. Upon a change of fortune he laid &s;iege to Athens, re&s;olving to cha&s;ti&s;e that rebellious and ungrateful people. He a&s;&s;embled the inhabitants in the thea|tre, &s;urrounding them with his army, as preparing for a total ma&s;&s;acre. But their terror was &s;hort; he pronounced their pardon, and be&s;towed on them 100,000 mea&s;ures of wheat. Ptolemy, the &s;ame who is mentioned above, having at the &s;iege of Tyre &s;ummoned Andronicus the governor to &s;ur|render, received a provoking and contemptuous an|&s;wer. The town being taken, Andronicus gave him&s;elf over for lo&s;t: but the King, thinking it below his dignity to re&s;ent an injury again&s;t an in|ferior, now his pri&s;oner, not only overlooked the affront, but courted Andronicus to be his friend. Edward the Black Prince is an in&s;lance of refined manners, breaking, like a &s;park of fire, through the gloom of barbarity. The Emperor Charles V. after lo&s;ing 30,000 men at the &s;iege of Metz, made an ignominious retreat, leaving his camp filled with &s;ick and wounded, dead and dying. Though the war between him and the King of France was car|ried on with unu&s;ual rancour, yet the Duke of Gui&s;e, governor of the town, exerted in tho&s;e bar|barous times a degree of humanity that would make a &s;plendid figure even at pre&s;ent: He ordered plen|ty of food for tho&s;e who were dying of hunger, ap|pointed &s;urgeons to attend the &s;ick and wounded, removed to the adjacent villages tho&s;e who could bear motion, and admitted the remainder into the

ho&s;pitals that he had fitted up for his own &s;oldiers; tho&s;e who recovered their health were &s;ent home, with money to defray the expence of the jour|ney.</P>
<P>In the period that intervenes between barbarity and humanity, there are not wanting in&s;tances of oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame per&s;on, governing al|ternately; as if a man could this moment be mild and gentle, and next moment har&s;h and brutal. To vouch the ob&s;ervation, I beg leave to introduce two rival monarchs, who for many years di&s;tre&s;&s;ed their own people, and di&s;turbed Europe, viz. the Emperor Charles, and the French King Francis. The Emperor, driven by contrary winds on the coa&s;t of France, was invited by Francis, who hap|pened to be in the neighbourhood, to take &s;helter in his dominions, propo&s;ing an interview at Aigues-Mortes, a &s;ea-port town. The Emperor in&s;tantly repaired there in his galley; and Francis, relying on the Emperor's honour, vi&s;ited him on &s;hipboard, and was received with every expre&s;&s;ion of affection. Next day, the Emperor repaid the confidence re|po&s;ed in him: he landed at Aigues-Mortes with as little precaution, and found a reception equally cordial. After twenty years of open ho&s;tilities, or of &s;ecret enmity, after having formally given the lie, and challenged each other to &s;ingle combat, after the Emperor had publicly inveighed again&s;t Francis as void of honour, and Francis had accu&s;ed the Emperor as murderer of his own &s;on; &s;uch behaviour will &s;carce be thought con&s;i&s;tent with human nature. But the&s;e monarchs lived in a pe|riod verging from cruelty to humanity; and &s;uch periods abound with &s;urpri&s;ing changes of temper and conduct. In the pre&s;ent times, &s;uch changes are unknown.</P>
<P>Conque&s;t has not always the &s;ame effect upon the manners of the conquered. The Tartars who
<PB N="48" REF="52">
&s;ubdued China in the thirteenth century, adopted immediately the Chine&s;e manners: the government, laws, cu&s;toms, continued without variation. And the &s;ame happened upon their &s;econd conque&s;t of China in the &s;eventeenth century. The barbarous nations al&s;o who cru&s;hed the Roman empire, adopted the laws, cu&s;toms, and manners, of the conquered. Very different was the fate of the Greek empire when conquered by the Turks That warlike nation in|troduced every where their own laws and manners: even at this day they continue a di&s;tinct people, as much as ever. The Tartars, as well as the bar|barians who overthrew the Roman empire, were all of them rude and illiterate, de&s;titute of laws, and ignorant of government. Such nations readily adopt the laws and manners of a civilized people, whom they admire. The Turks had laws, and a regular government; and the Greeks, when &s;ubdued by them, were reduced by luxury and &s;en&s;uality to be objects of contempt, not of imitation.</P>
<P>Manners are deeply affected by per&s;ecution. The forms of procedure in the Inqui&s;ition enable the inqui&s;itors to ruin whom they plea&s;e. A per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed is not confronted with the accu&s;er: every &s;ort of accu&s;ation is welcome, and from every per&s;on: a child, a common pro&s;titute, one branded with infamy, are reputable witne&s;&s;es: a &s;on is compelled to give evidence again&s;t his father, and a woman again&s;t her hu&s;band. Nay, the per&s;ons accu&s;ed are compelled to inform again&s;t them&s;elves, by gue&s;&s;ing what &s;in they may have been guilty of. Such odi|ous, cruel. and tyrannical proceedings, made all Spain tremble: every man di&s;tru&s;ted his neighbour, and even his own family: a total end was put to friend&s;hip, and to &s;ocial freedom. Hence the gra|vity and re&s;erve of a people, who have naturally all

Hence the profound ignorance of that people, while other European nations are daily improving in eve|ry art and in every &s;cience. Human nature is reduced to its lowe&s;t &s;tate, when governed by &s;uper|&s;tition clothed with power.</P>
<P>We proceed to another capital article in the hi&s;|tory of manners, viz. the &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ocial branches of our nature, by which manners are greatly influ|enced. Selfi&s;hne&s;s prevails among &s;avages; becau&s;e corporeal plea&s;ures are its chief objects, and of the e every &s;avage is perfectly &s;en&s;ible. Benevolence and kindly affection are too refined for a &s;avage, unle&s;s of the &s;imple&s;t kind, &s;uch as the ties of blood. While artificial wants were unknown, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s made no &s;igure: the means of gratifying the calls of nature were in plenty; and men, who are not afraid of ever being in want, never think of provid|ing again&s;t it; and far le&s;s do they think of coveting what belongs to another. But men are not long contented with &s;imple nece&s;&s;aries: an unwearied appetite to be more and more comfortably provided, leads them from nece&s;&s;aries to conveniencies, and from the&s;e to every luxury of life. Avarice turns head&s;trong; and locks and bars, formerly unknown, become nece&s;&s;ary to protect individuals from the rapacity of their neighbours. When the goods of fortune, money in particular, come to be prized, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s &s;oon di&s;plays it&s;elf. In Madaga&s;car, a man who makes a pre&s;ent of an ox or a calf, ex|pects the value in return: and &s;cruples not to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You my friend, I your friend; you no my friend, I no your friend; I &s;alamanca you, you &s;alamanca me."</Q> Salamanca means, the making a pre&s;ent.
<PB N="50" REF="54">
Admiral Wat&s;on being introduced to the King of Baba, in Madaga&s;car, was a&s;ked by his Maje&s;ty, what pre&s;ents he had brought. Hence the cu&s;tom, univer&s;al among barbarians, of always acco&s;ting a king, or any man of high rank, with pre&s;ents. The peculiar excellence of man, above all other animals, is the capacity he has of improving by education and example. In proportion as his faculties refine, he acquires a reli&s;h for &s;ociety, and finds a plea&s;ure in benevolence, genero&s;ity, and in every other kind|ly affection, far above what &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s can afford. How agreeable is this &s;cene! Alas, too agreeable to la&s;t for ever. Opulence and luxury inflame the hoarding appetite; and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s at la&s;t prevails as it did originally. The &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s however of &s;avages differs from that of pampered people. Luxury, confining a man's whole views to him&s;elf, admits not of friend&s;hip, and &s;carce of any other &s;ocial pa&s;|&s;ion. But where a &s;avage takes a liking to a parti|cular per&s;on, the whole force of his &s;ocial affection being directed to a &s;ingle object, becomes extreme|ly fervid. Hence the unexampled friend&s;hip between Achilles and Patroclus in the Iliad; and hence ma|ny &s;uch friend&s;hips among &s;avages.</P>
<P>But there is much more to be &s;aid of the influence of opulence on manners. Rude and illiterate nati|ons are tenacious of their laws and manners; for they are governed by cu&s;tom, which is more and more rivetted by length of time. A people, on the contrary, who are poli&s;hed by having pa&s;&s;ed through various &s;cenes, are full of invention, and con&s;tantly thinking of new modes. Manners in particular can never be &s;tationary, in a nation which is refined by pro&s;perity and the arts of peace. Good government will advance men to a high degree of civilization; but the very be&s;t government will not pre&s;erve them from corruption, after becoming rich by pro&s;perity. Opulence begets luxury, and envigorates the appe|tite

for &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure. The appetite, when in|flamed, is never confined within moderate bounds, but clings to every object of gratification, without regard to propriety or decency. When Septimius Severus was elected Emperor, he found on the roll of cau&s;es depending before the judges in Rome no fewer than three thou&s;and accu&s;ations of adultery. From that moment he abandoned all thoughts of attempting a reformation. Love of plea&s;ure is &s;imilar to love of money: the more they are indulg|ed the more they are inflamed. Polygamy is an incentive to the vice again&s;t nature; one act of in|continence leading to others, without end. When the Sultan Achmet was depo&s;ed at Con&s;tantinople, the people breaking into the hou&s;e of one of his favourites, found not a &s;ingle woman. It is report|ed of the Algerines, that in many of their &s;eraglios there are no women. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, poly|gamy is far from preventing adultery, a truth finely illu&s;trated in Nathan's parable to David. What judgement then are we to form of the opulent cities London and Paris, where plea&s;ure is the ruling pa&s;|&s;ion, and where riches are coveted as in&s;truments of &s;en&s;uality? What is to be expected but a pe&s;tifer|ous corruption of manners? Selfi&s;hne&s;s, ingro&s;&s;ing the whole &s;oul, eradicates patrioti&s;m, and leaves not a cranny for &s;ocial virtue. If in that condition men ab&s;tain from robbery or from murder, it is not love of ju&s;tice that re&s;trains them, but dread of pu|ni&s;hment. Babylon is arraigned by Greek writers for luxury, &s;en&s;uality, and profligacy. But Baby|lon repre&s;ents the capital of every opulent kingdom, ancient and modern: the manners of all are the &s;ame; for power and riches never fail to produce luxury, &s;en&s;uality, and profligacy. Canghi Em|peror of China, who died in the year 1722, de&s;erves to be recorded in the annals of fame, for re&s;i&s;ting the &s;oftne&s;s and effeminacy of an A&s;iatic court. Far

Nor in that &s;ituation were affairs of &s;tate neglected: many hours he borrowed from &s;leep, to hear his mini&s;ters, and to i&s;&s;ue orders. How few monarchs, bred up like Canghi in the downy indolence of a feraglio, have re&s;olution to with&s;tand the temptati|ons of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>In no other hi&s;tory is the influence of pro&s;perity and opulence on manners &s;o con&s;picuous as in that of old Rome. During the &s;econd Punic war, when the Romans were reduced by Hannibal to fight pro aris et focis, Hiero King of Syracu&s;e &s;ent to Rome a large quantity of corn, with a golden &s;tatue of victory weighing three hundred and twenty pounds, which the &s;enate accepted. But though their finances were at the lowe&s;t ebb, they accepted but the lighte&s;t of forty golden va&s;es pre&s;ented to them by the city of Naples; and politely returned, with many thanks, &s;ome golden va&s;es &s;ent by the city of Pae&s;tum, in Lucania: A rare in&s;tance of magnani|mity! But no degree of virtue is proof again&s;t the corruption of conque&s;t and opulence. Upon the infiux of A&s;iatic riches and luxury, the Romans abandoned them&s;elves to every vice: they became in particular wonderfully avaricious, breaking thro' every re&s;traint of ju&s;tice and humanity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">Po&s;tquam divitiae honori e&s;&s;e coeperent, et eas gloria, imperium, potentia &s;equebatur; hebe&s;cere virtus, pauper|tas probro haberi, innocentia pro malevolentia duci, coepit, Igitur ex divitiis juventutem luxuria, atque avaritia, cum &s;uperbia inva&s;ere.</Q> Sallu&s;t.

particular, which abounded with gold and &s;ilver, was for many years a &s;cene, not only of oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, but of the ba&s;e&s;t treachery, practi&s;ed again&s;t the natives by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Roman generals in order to accumulate wealth. Lucullus, who after|ward made a capital figure in the Mithridatic war, attacked Cauca, a Celtiberian city, without the &s;lighte&s;t provocation. Some of the principal citi|zens repaired to his camp with olive-branches, de&s;iring to be informed upon what conditions they could purcha&s;e his friend&s;hip. It was agreed, that they &s;hould give ho&s;tages, with an hundred talents of &s;ilver. They al&s;o con&s;ented to admit a garri&s;on of 2000 men, in order, as Lucullus pretended, to protect them again&s;t their enemies. But how were they protected? The gates were opened by the garri&s;on to the whole army; and the inhabitants were butchered, without di&s;tinction of &s;ex or age. What other remedy had they, but to invoke the gods pre&s;iding over oaths and covenants, and to pour out execrations again&s;t the Romans for their perfidy? Lucullus, enriched with the &s;poils of the town, felt no remor&s;e for leaving 20,000 per&s;ons dead upon the &s;pot. Shortly after, having laid &s;iege to Intercatia, he &s;olicited a treaty of peace. The citizens, reproaching him with the &s;laughter of the Cauceans, a&s;ked, whether, in making peace, he was not to employ the &s;ame right hand, and the &s;ame faith, he had already pledged to their country-men. Seroclius Galba, another Roman general, per&s;uaded the Lu&s;itanians to lay down their arms, promi&s;ing them a fruitful territory in&s;tead of their own mountains; and having thus got them into his
<PB N="54" REF="58">
power, he ordered all of them to be murdered. Of the few that e&s;caped Viriatus was one, who, in a long and bloody war again&s;t the Romans, amply avenged the ma&s;&s;acre of his countrymen. Our au|thor Appian reports, that Galba, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing even Lucullus in covetou&s;ne&s;s, di&s;tributed but a &s;mall &s;hare of the plunder among the &s;oldiers, converting the bulk of it to his own u&s;e. He adds, that tho' Galba was one of the riche&s;t men in Rome, yet he never &s;crupled at lies nor perjury to procure money. But the corruption was general: Galba being ac|cu&s;ed of many mi&s;demeanors, was acquitted by the &s;enate through the force of bribes. A tribe of the Celtiberians, who had long &s;erved the Romans again&s;t the Lu&s;itanians, had an offer made them by Titus Didius of a territory in their neighbour|hood, lately conquered by him. He appointed them a day to receive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and having in|clo&s;ed them in his camp under &s;hew of friend&s;hip, he put them all to the &s;word; for which mighty deed he obtained the honour of a triumph. The double-dealing and treachery of the Romans, in their la&s;t war again&s;t Carthage, is beyond example. The Carthaginians, &s;u&s;pecting that a &s;torm was gathering again&s;t them, &s;ent deputies to Rome for &s;ecuring peace at any rate. The &s;enate, in ap|pearance, were di&s;po&s;ed to amicable mea&s;ures, de|manding only ho&s;tages; and yet, though three hundred ho&s;tages were delivered without lo&s;s of time, the Roman army landed at Utica. The Carthaginian deputies attended the con&s;uls there, de&s;iring to know what more was to be done on their part. They were required to deliver up their arms; which they chearfully did, imagining that they were now certain of peace. In&s;tead of which, they received peremptory orders to evacuate the city, with their wives and children; and to take up no habitation within eighty furlongs of the &s;ea. In

Having repaired to Rome for protection, he &s;ound means to poi&s;on the greater part of an hundred Egyptians, his accu&s;ers, and to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Dion, their chief. And yet the&s;e crimes, perpetrated in the heart of Rome, were &s;uffered to pa&s;s with impunity. But he had &s;ecured the leading men by bribery, and was protected by Pompey. The following in&s;tance is, it po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more gro&s;s: Ptolomy, King of Cyprus, had always been a faithful ally to the Ro|mans. But his gold, jewels, and precious move|ables, were a tempting bait to the avarice of Rome; and all was confi&s;cated by a decree of the people, without even a pretext. Money, procured by pro|fligacy, is not commonly hoarded up; and the Ro|mans were no le&s;s voluptuous than avaricious. Alex|ander ab Alexandro mentions the Fanian, Orchian, Didian, Oppian, Cornelian, Ancian, and Julian laws, for repre&s;&s;ing luxury of dre&s;s and of eating, all of which proved ineffectual. He adds, that Ti|berius had it long at heart to contrive &s;ome effectual law again&s;t luxury, which now had &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all bounds; but that he found it impracticable to &s;tem the tide. He concludes, that by tacit agreement among a corrupted people all &s;umptuary laws were in effect abrogated; and that the Roman people, abandoning them&s;elves to vice, broke through every re&s;traint of morality and religion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Lib. 3. cap. 11.</NOTE>.

<P>Selfi&s;hne&s;s, among the rude and illiterate, is rough, blunt, and undi&s;gui&s;ed. Selfi&s;hne&s;s, which, in an opulent kingdom, u&s;urps the place of patrio|ti&s;m, is &s;mooth, refined, and covered with a veil. Pecuniary intere&s;t, a low object, mu&s;t be covered with the thicke&s;t veil: ambition, le&s;s di&s;nonou|rable, is le&s;s covered: but delicacy, as to charac|ter and love of fame, is &s;o honourable, that even the thinne&s;t veil is thought unnece&s;&s;ary. Hi&s;tory ju&s;tifies the&s;e ob&s;ervations.

<P>I fly from a &s;cene &s;o di&s;mal, to one that will give no pain. Light is intended by our Maker for action, and darkne&s;s for re&s;t. In the fourteenth century, the &s;hops in Paris were opened at four in the morning: at pre&s;ent, a &s;hopkeeper is &s;carce awake at &s;even. The King of France dined at eight in the morning, and retired to his bed-cham|ber at the &s;ame hour in the evening; an early hour at pre&s;ent for public amu&s;ements. The Spaniards adhere to ancient cu&s;toms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Manners and fa&s;hions &s;eldom change, where wo|men are locked up.</NOTE>. Their King, to this day, dines preci&s;ely at noon, and &s;ups no le&s;s pre|ci&s;ely at nine in the evening. During the reign of Henry VIII. fa&s;hionable people in England break|fa&s;ted at &s;even in the morning, and dined at ten in the forenoon. In Elizabeth's time, the nobility, gentry, and &s;tudents dined at eleven forenoon, and &s;upped between five and &s;ix afternoon. In the reign of Charles II. four in the afternoon was the appointed hour for acting plays: at pre&s;ent, even dinner is at a later hour. The King of Yeman, the greate&s;t prince in Arabia Foelix, dines at nine in the morning, &s;ups at five after noon, and goes to re&s;t at eleven. From this &s;hort &s;pecimen it ap|pears, that the occupations of day-light commence gradually later and later; as if there was a ten|dency in polite nations of converting night into day, and day nto night. Nothing happens without a cau&s;e. Light di&s;po&s;es to action, darkne&s;s to re&s;t: the diver&s;ions of day are tournaments, hunting, racing, and &s;uch like active exerci&s;es: the diver&s;i|ons of night are &s;edentary; plays, cards, conver|&s;ation. Balls are of a mixed nature; partly active,
<PB N="59" REF="63">
in dancing; partly &s;edentary, in conver&s;ing. For|merly, active exerci&s;es prevailed among a robu&s;t and plain people: the milder plea&s;ures of &s;ociety prevail as manners refine. Hence it is, that candle|light amu&s;ements are now fa&s;hionable in France, and in other poli&s;hed countries: and when &s;uch amu&s;ements are much reli&s;hed, they bani&s;h the robu&s;t exerci&s;es of the field. Balls, I conjecture, were formerly more frequent in day-light: at pre|&s;ent, candle-light is their favourite time; the active part is, at that time, equally agreeable; and the fed ntary part much more &s;o.</P>
<P>Gaming is the vice of idle people. Savages are addicted to gaming; and tho&s;e of North Ame|rica, in particular, are fond to di&s;traction of a game termed the Platter. A lo&s;ing game&s;ter will &s;trip him&s;elf to the &s;kin; and &s;ome have been known to &s;take their liberty, though by them valued above all other ble&s;&s;ings. Negroes in the &s;lave|coa&s;t of Guinea will &s;take their wives, their chil|dren, and even them&s;elves. Tacitus<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">De Moribus Germanorum, cap. 24.</NOTE>, talking of gaming among the Germans, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Extremo ac novi&s;&s;imo jactu de libertate et de corpore con|tendant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For their la&s;t throw, they &s;take their liberty and life."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> The Greeks were an active and &s;prightly people, con&s;tantly engaged in war, or in cultivating the &s;ine arts. They had no lei&s;ure for gaming, nor any knowledge of it. Happy for them was their ignorance; for no other vice tends more to render men &s;elfi&s;h, di&s;hone&s;t, and, in the mo|di&s;h &s;tyle, di&s;honourable. A game&s;ter, a friend to no man, is a bitter enemy to him&s;elf. The luxu|rious of the pre&s;ent age pa&s;s every hour in gam|ing, that can be &s;pared from &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure. Idle|ne&s;s is their excu&s;e, as it is among &s;avages; and

they would in &s;ome degree be excu&s;able, were they never actuated by a more di&s;graceful mo|tive.</P>
<P>Writers do not carefully di&s;tingui&s;h particular cu&s;toms from general manners. Formerly, wo|men were not admitted upon the &s;tage in France, Italy, or England. At that very time, none but women were admitted in Spain. From that fa&s;hion it would be ra&s;h to infer, that women have more liberty in Spain, than in the other countries men|tioned; for the contrary is true. In Hindo&s;tan, e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom prompts women to burn them|&s;elves alive, with the bodies of their decea&s;ed hu&s;|bands; but from that &s;ingular cu&s;tom, it would be a fal&s;e inference, that the Hindow women are ei|ther more bold, or more affectionate to their hu&s;|bands, than in other countries. The Polanders, even after they became Chri&s;tians in the thirteenth century, adhered to the cu&s;toms of their forefa|thers, the Sarmatians; the killing, for example, infants born deformed, and men debilitated by age; which would betoken horrid barbarity, if it were not a &s;ingular cu&s;tom. Roman Catholics imagine, that there is no religion in England nor in Holland, becau&s;e, from a &s;pirit of civil liberty, all &s;ects are there tolerated. The encouragement given to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in Italy, where every church is a &s;anc|tuary, makes &s;trangers ra&s;hly infer, that the Italians are all a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. Writers &s;ometimes fall into an oppo&s;ite mi&s;take, attributing to a particular nation, certain manners and cu&s;toms common to all nations in one or other period of their progre&s;s. It is re|marked by Heraclides Ponticus, as peculiar to the Athamanes, that the men fed the flocks, and the women cultivated the ground. This has been the practice of all nations, in their progre&s;s from the &s;hepherd-&s;tate to that of hu&s;bandry; and is at pre|&s;ent the practice among American &s;avages. The
<PB N="61" REF="65">
&s;ame author ob&s;erves, as peculiar to the Celtae and Aphitaei, that they leave their doors open without hazard of theft. But that practice is common among all &s;avages in the fir&s;t &s;tage of &s;ociety, before the u&s;e of money is known.</P>
<P>Hitherto there appears as great uniformity in the progre&s;s of manners, as can rea&s;onably be expected among &s;o many different nations. There is one exception, extraordinary indeed, if true, which is, the manners of the Caledonians, de&s;cribed by O&s;&s;i|an, manners &s;o pure and refined, as &s;carce to be equalled in the mo&s;t cultivated nations. Such manners, among a people in the fir&s;t &s;tage of &s;ociety, acquainted with no arts but hunting and making war, would, I acknowledge, be miracu|lous: and yet, to &s;uppo&s;e all to be invented by an illiterate &s;avage, &s;eems little le&s;s miraculous. One, at fir&s;t view, will, without he&s;itation, declare the whole a pure fiction; for how is it credible, that a people, rude at pre&s;ent, and illiterate, were, in the infancy of their &s;ociety, highly refined in &s;en|timents and manners? And yet, upon a more ac|curate in&s;pection, many weighty con&s;iderations oc|cur to balance that opinion.</P>
<P>From a thou&s;and circum&s;tances it appears, that the works of O&s;&s;ian are not a late production. They are compo&s;ed in an old dialect of the Celtic tongue; and as, till of late, they were known only in the Highlands of Scotland, the author mu&s;t have been a Caledonian.

<P>It is a noted and well-founded ob&s;ervation, That manners are never painted to the life by any one to whom they are not familiar. It is not difficult to draw the outlines of imaginary manners; but to fill up the picture with all the variety of tints that manners a&s;&s;ume in different &s;ituations, uniting all in one entire whole,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"hic labor, hoc opus e&s;t."</Q> Yet the manners here &s;uppo&s;ed to be invented, are delineated in a variety of incidents, of &s;entiments, of images, and of allu&s;ions, making one entire picture, without once deviating into the &s;lighte&s;t incongruity. Every &s;cene in O&s;&s;ian relates to hunting, to fighting, and to love, the &s;ole occu|pations of men, in the original &s;tate of &s;ociety: there is not a &s;ingle image, &s;imile, nor allu&s;ion, but what is borrowed from that &s;tate, without a jarring circum&s;tance. Suppo&s;ing all to be mere invention, is it not amazing to find no mention of Highland Clans, nor of any name now in u&s;e? Is it not &s;till more amazing, that there is not the

Is it not equally amazing, that, in a work where deer's fle&s;h is frequently mentioned, and a curious method of roa&s;ting it, there &s;hould not be a word of fi&s;h as food, which is &s;o common in later times? Very few High|landers know that their forefathers did not eat fi&s;h; and, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be known, it would re|quire attention more than human, never once to mention it. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a modern writer could be &s;o con&s;tantly on his guard, as never to mention corn, nor cattle? In a &s;tory &s;o &s;canty of poetical images, the &s;edentary life of a &s;hepherd, and the indu&s;try of a hu&s;bandman, would make a capital figure: the cloven foot would &s;omewhere appear. And yet, in all the works of O&s;&s;ian, there is no mention of agriculture; and but a &s;light hint of a herd of cattle in one or two allu&s;i|ons. I willingly give all advantages to the unbe|liever. Suppo&s;ing the author of O&s;&s;ian to be a late writer, embelli&s;hed with every refinement of mo|dern education: yet, even upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, he is a miracle, far from being equalled by any other author, ancient or modern.</P>
<P>But difficulties multiply, when it is taken into the account, that the poems of O&s;&s;ian have ex|i&s;ted three or four centuries at lea&s;t. Our High|landers, at pre&s;ent, are rude and illiterate; and were, in fact, little better than &s;avages, at the pe|riod mentioned. Now, to hold the manners de|&s;cribed in that work to be imaginary, is, in effect, to hold, that they were invented by a Highland &s;avage, acquainted with the rude manners of his country, but utterly unacquainted with every other &s;y&s;tem of manners. From what &s;ource did he draw the refined manners &s;o deliciou&s;ly painted by him? Suppo&s;ing him to have been a traveller, of which we have not the &s;lighte&s;t hint, the manners, at
<PB N="64" REF="68">
that period, of France, of Italy, and of other neighbouring nations, were little le&s;s barbarous than tho&s;e of his own country. I can di&s;cover no &s;ource, other than direct in&s;piration. In a word, whoever &s;eriou&s;ly believes the manners of O&s;&s;ian to be fictitious, may well &s;ay, with the religious enthu&s;ia&s;t, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Credo, quia impo&s;&s;ibile e&s;t:"</Q> [I be|lieve it, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible.]</P>
<P>But further: The uncommon talents of the au|thor of this work will chearfully be acknowledged by every reader of ta&s;te: he certainly was a great ma&s;ter in his way. Now, whether the work be late, or compo&s;ed four centuries ago, a man of &s;uch talents inventing an hi&s;torical fable, and laying the &s;cene of action among &s;avages in the hunter-&s;tate, would naturally frame a &s;y&s;tem of manners, the be&s;t &s;uited, in his opinion, to that &s;tate. What then could tempt him to adopt a &s;y&s;tem of manners &s;o oppo&s;ite to any notion he could frame of &s;avage manners? The ab&s;urdity is &s;o gro&s;s, that we are forced, however reluctantly, to believe, that the&s;e manners are not fictitious; but, in reality, the man|ners of his country, coloured, perhaps, or a little heightened, according to the privilege of an epic poet. And, once admitting that fact, there can be no he&s;itation in a&s;cribing that work to O&s;&s;ian, &s;on of Fingal, who&s;e name it bears: we have no better evidence for the authors of &s;everal Greek and Roman books. Upon the &s;ame evidence we mu&s;t believe, that O&s;&s;ian lived in the reign of the Emperor Caracalla, of whom frequent mention is made under the de&s;ignation of Caracul the Great King; at which period the &s;hepherd &s;tate was &s;carce known in Caledonia, and hu&s;bandry not at all. Had he lived &s;o late as the twelfth century, when there were flocks and herds in that country, and &s;ome &s;ort of agriculture, a poet of genius,
<PB N="65" REF="69">
&s;uch as O&s;&s;ian undoubtedly was, would have drawn from the&s;e his fine&s;t images.</P>
<P>The foregoing con&s;iderations, I am per&s;uaded, would not fail to convert the mo&s;t incredulous, were it not for a con&s;equence extremely impro|bable, that a people, little better at pre&s;ent than &s;avages, were, in their primitive hunter-&s;tate, highly refined; for &s;uch O&s;&s;ian de&s;cribes them. And yet it is not le&s;s improbable, that &s;uch man|ners &s;hould be invented by an illiterate Highland bard. Let a man chu&s;e either &s;ide, the difficulty cannot be &s;olved, but by a miracle. What &s;hall we conclude upon the whole? for the mind cannot for ever remain in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. As dry rea&s;oning has left us in a dilemma, ta&s;te, perhaps, and feeling may extricate us. May not the ca&s;e be here as in real painting? A portrait drawn from fancy may re&s;emble the human vi&s;age; but &s;uch peculiarity of countenance and expre&s;&s;ion, as &s;erves to di&s;tin|gui&s;h a certain per&s;on from every other, is always wanting. Pre&s;ent a portrait to a man of ta&s;te, and he will be at no lo&s;s to &s;ay, whether it be copied from the life, or be the product of fancy. If O&s;&s;i|an paint from fancy, the cloven foot will appear: but if his portraits be complete, &s;o as to expre&s;s every peculiarity of character, why &s;hould we doubt of their being copied from life? In that view, the reader, I am hopeful, will not think his time thrown away in examining &s;ome of O&s;&s;i|an's &s;triking pictures. I &s;ee not any other re|&s;ource.</P>
<P>Love of fame is painted by O&s;&s;ian as the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of his countrymen, the Caledonians.

And &s;o much were they regarded, as to be thought capable of the highe&s;t command. <Q REND="inline">"Neque enim &s;exum in imperiis di&s;cernunt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They made no di&s;tinction of &s;ex in conferring authority."</Q></NOTE>,"</Q> &s;ays the &s;ame author<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Vita Agricolae, cap. 16.</NOTE>. And accordingly, during the war carried on by Ca|ractacus, a gallant Briti&s;h King, again&s;t the Ro|mans, Carti&s;mandua was Queen of the Brigantes. Boadicea is recorded in Roman annals as a queen of a warlike &s;pirit. She led on a great army again&s;t the Romans; and in exhorting her people to be|have with courage, &s;he ob&s;erved, that it was not unu&s;ual to &s;ee a Briti&s;h army led on to battle by a woman; to which Tacitus adds his te&s;tmony: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Solitum quidem Britannis foeminarum ductu bel|lare<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Britons even followed women as leaders in the field."</Q></NOTE><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Annalium lib. 14.</NOTE>."</Q> No wonder that Celtic women, &s;o amply provided with &s;pirit, as well as beauty, made a capital figure in every public entertainment<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Athenaeus, lib. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Gallic Celtae undoubtedly carried with them their manners and cu&s;toms to Britain, and &s;pread them gradually from &s;outh to north.

bards. All the chieftains had bards in their pay, who&s;e province it was to compo&s;e &s;ongs in prai&s;e of their ance&s;tors, and to accompany tho&s;e &s;ongs with the harp. This entertainment enflamed their love for war, and at the &s;ame time &s;oftened their man|ners, which, as Strabo reports, were naturally in|nocent and void of malignity. It had be&s;ide a won|derful influence in forming virtuous manners: the bards, in prai&s;ing decea&s;ed heroes, would naturally &s;elect virtuous actions, which make the be&s;t figure in heroic poetry, and tend the mo&s;t to illu&s;trate the hero of their &s;ong: vice may be flattered; but prai&s;e is never willingly nor &s;ucce&s;sfully be&s;towed upon any atchievement but what is virtuous and heroic. It is accordingly ob&s;erved by Ammianus Marcellinus<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Lib. 15.</NOTE>, that the bards inculcated in their &s;ongs virtue and actions worthy of prai&s;e. The bards, who were in high e&s;timation, became great proficients in poetry; of which we have a con&s;pi|cuous in&s;tance in the works of O&s;&s;ian. Their capi|tal compo&s;itions were diligently &s;tudied by tho&s;e of their own order, and much admired by all. The &s;ongs of the bards, accompanied with the harp, made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the young warrior, ele|vated &s;ome into heroes, and promoted virtue in every hearer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">Hiberni &s;unt mu&s;icae periti&s;&s;imi.</Q>&mdash;[in Engli&s;h thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Iri&s;h are mo&s;t &s;kilful in mu&s;ic."</Q>&mdash;Ireland was peopled from Britain; and the mu&s;ic of that country mu&s;t have been derived from Briti&s;h bards. The Wel&s;h bards were the great cham|pions of independence; and in particular promoted an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance to Edward I. when he carried his arms into Wales. And hence the tradition, that the Wel&s;h bards were all &s;laughtered by that King.</NOTE>. Another circum&s;tance concurred to form Caledonian manners, common to them with every nation in the fir&s;t &s;tage of &s;ociety; which is,

that avarice was unknown among them. People in that &s;tage, ignorant of habitual wants, and having a ready &s;upply of all that nature requires, have lit|tle notion of property, and not the &s;lighte&s;t notion of accumulating the goods of fortune; and for that rea&s;on are always found hone&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted. With re&s;pect to the female &s;ex, who make an illu&s;trious figure in O&s;&s;ian's poems, if they were &s;o eminent both for courage and beauty as they are repre&s;ented by the be&s;t authors, it is no wonder that they are painted by O&s;&s;ian as objects of love the mo&s;t pure and refined. Nor ought it to be over|looked, that the &s;oft and delicate notes of the harp have a tendency to purify manners, and to refine love.</P>
<P>Whether the cau&s;es here a&s;&s;igned of Celtic man|ners be fully adequate may well admit of a doubt; but if authentic hi&s;tory be relied on, we can enter|tain no doubt, that the manners of the Gallic and Briti&s;h Celiae, including the Caledonians, were &s;uch as are above de&s;cribed. And as the manners a&s;cribed by O&s;&s;ian to his conntrymen the Caledoni|ans, are in every particular conformable to tho&s;e now mentioned, it clearly follows, that O&s;&s;ian was no inventor, but drew his pictures of manners from real life. This is made highly probable from in|trin&s;ic evidence, the &s;ame that is &s;o copiou&s;ly urged above: and now by authentic hi&s;tory that probabi|lity is &s;o much heightened as &s;carce to leave room for a doubt.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent highlanders are but a &s;mall part of the inhabitants of Britain; and they have been &s;inking in their importance, from the time that arts and &s;ciences made a figure, and peaceable manners pre|vailed. And yet in that people are di&s;cernible ma|ny remaining features of their forefathers the Cale|donians. They have to this day a di&s;po&s;ition to war, and when di&s;ciplined make excellent &s;oldiers,
<PB N="90" REF="94">
&s;ober, active, and obedient. They are eminently ho&s;pitable; and the character given by Strabo of the Gallic Celiae, that they were innocent, and devoid of malignity, is to them perfectly applicable. That they have not the magnanimity and heroi&s;m of the Caledonians, is ea&s;ily accounted for. The Caledonians were a free and independent people, unawed by any &s;uperior power, and living under the mild government of their own chieftains: compar|ed with their forefathers, the pre&s;ent highlanders make a very incon&s;iderable figure: their country is barren, and at any rate is but a &s;mall part of a po|tent kingdom; and their language deprives them of intercour&s;e with their poli&s;hed neighbours.</P>
<P>There certainly never happened in literature a di&s;covery more extraordinary than the works of O&s;&s;i|an.

But if a forgery, why &s;o bold and improbable? why not invent manners more con|gruous to the &s;avage &s;tate? And as at any rate the work has greater merit, why did the author conceal him&s;elf? The&s;e con&s;iderations rou&s;ed my attention, and produced the foregoing di&s;qui&s;ition; which I fini&s;hed, without imagining that any more light could be obtained. But after a long interval, a thought &s;truck me, that as the Caledonians formerly were much connected with the Scandinavians, the manners of the latter might probably give light in the pre&s;ent enquiry. I chearfully &s;pread my &s;ails in a wide ocean, not without hopes of importing precious merchandi&s;e.

<P>Much efficacy is above a&s;cribed to the &s;ongs of Caledonian bards; and with &s;atisfaction I find my ob&s;ervations ju&s;tified in every Scandinavian hi&s;tory. The Kings of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, are repre&s;ented in ancient chronicles as con&s;tantly attended with &s;calds or bards; who were treated with great re&s;pect, e&s;pecially by princes di&s;tingui&s;h|ed in war. Harold Harfager at his fea&s;ts placed them above all his other officers; and employed them in negotiations of the greate&s;t importance. The poetic art, held in great e&s;timation, was cul|tivated by men of the fir&s;t rank. Rogvald, Earl of Orkney, pa&s;&s;ed for an able poet. King Regnar was di&s;tingui&s;hed in poetry, no le&s;s than in war. It was the proper province of bards in Scandinavia, as in other countries, to celebrate in odes the atchieve|ments of decea&s;ed heroes. They were frequently employed in animating the troops before a battle. Hacon, Earl of Norway, in his famous engagement again&s;t the warriors of Iom&s;burg, had five celebrat|ed poets, each of whom &s;ung an ode to the &s;oldiers ready to engage. Saxo Grammaticus, de&s;cribing a battle between Waldemar and Sueno, mentions a &s;cald belonging to the former, who, advancing to the front of the army, reproached the latter in a pathetic ode as the murderer of his own father.</P>
<P>The odes of the Scandinavian bards have a pecu|liar energy; which is not difficult to be accounted
<PB N="93" REF="97">
for. The propen&s;ity of the Scandinavians to war, their love of glory, their undaunted courage, and their warlike exploits, naturally produced elevated &s;entiments, and an elevated tone of language; both of which were di&s;played in celebrating heroic deeds. Take the following in&s;tances. The fir&s;t is from the Edda, which contains the birth and genealogy of their gods. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The giant Rymer arrives from the ea&s;t, carried in a chariot: the great &s;erpent, rolling him&s;elf furiou&s;ly in the waters, li&s;teth up the &s;ea. The eagle &s;ereams, and with his horrid beak tears the dead. The ve&s;&s;el of the gods is &s;et afloat. The black prince of &s;ire i&s;&s;ues from the &s;outh, &s;urrounded with flames: the &s;words of the gods beam like the &s;un: &s;haken are the rocks, and fall to pieces. The female giants wander about weeping: men in crowds tread the paths of death. Heaven is &s;plit a&s;under, the &s;un darkened, and the earth &s;unk in fhe ocean.

From the bo&s;om of the waves an earth emerges, clothed with lovely green: the floods retire: the fields produce with|out culture: misfortunes are bani&s;hed from the world. Balder and his brother, gods of war, return to inhabit the ruined palace of Odin. A palace more re&s;plendent than the &s;un ri&s;es now to view; adorned with a roof of gold: there good men &s;hall inhabit&punc; and live in joy and plea|&s;ure through all ages."</Q> In a collection of anci|ent hi&s;torical monuments of the north, publi&s;hed by Biorner, a learned Swede, there is the following pa&s;&s;age. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Grunder, perceiving Grymer ru&s;hing furiou&s;ly through oppo&s;ing battalions, cries aloud, Thou alone remaine&s;t to engage with me in &s;ingle combat.

Grymer cleaves the ca&s;que of his enemy, hews his armour in pieces, and pours the light into his bo&s;om.

The capital circum&s;tances are judiciou&s;ly &s;elected; and the narration is compact and rapid.

Chief mixes his &s;trokes with chief, and man with man; &s;teel &s;ounds on &s;teel, helmets are cleft on high. Blood bur&s;ts, and &s;moaks around. Strings murmur on the poli&s;hed yew. Darts ru&s;h along the &s;ky. Spears fall like &s;parks of flame that gild the &s;tor|my face of night. As the noi&s;e of the troubled ocean when roll the waves on high, as the la&s;t peal of thundering heaven, &s;uch is the noi&s;e of battle. Though Cormac's hundred bards were there, feeble were the voice of an hundred bards to &s;end the deaths to future times; for many were the heroes who fell, and wide poured the blood of the valiant."</Q> Again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As roll a thou&s;and waves to the rocks, &s;o came on Swaran's ho&s;t: as meets a rock a thou&s;and waves, &s;o Innis-fail met Swaran.

<P>Hitherto the manners of the Scandinavians re|&s;emble, in many capital circum&s;tances, tho&s;e deli|neated in the works of O&s;&s;ian.

It is a fact a&s;certained by many writers, That women in the north of Europe were eminent for re&s;olution and courage. Cae&s;ar, in the fir&s;t book of his Commentaries, de&s;cribing a battle he fought with the Helvetii, &s;ays, that the women, with a warlike &s;pirit, exhorted their hu&s;bands to per&s;i&s;t, and placed the waggons in a line, to prevent their flight. Florus and Tacitus mention that &s;everal battles of tho&s;e barbarous nations were renewed by their women, pre&s;enting their naked bo&s;oms, and declaring their abhorrence of captivity. Fla|vius Vopi&s;cus, writing of Proculus Cae&s;ar, &s;ays, that an hundred Samaritan virgins were taken in battle.

<P>To find women, in no incon&s;iderable portion of the globe, dropping their timid nature, and rivalling men in their capital property of courage, is a &s;ingular phoenomenon.

<PB N="100" REF="104">
nor divorce were ever heard of in that country, not even during pagani&s;m.</P>
<P>We have the authority of Procopius<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toria Gothica, lib. 3.</NOTE>, that the women in tho&s;e countries were remarkable for beauty, and that tho&s;e of the Goths and Vandals were the fine&s;t that ever had been &s;een in Italy; and we have the authority of Crantz, that cha&s;ti|ty was in high e&s;timation among the Danes, Swedes, and other Scandinavians. When the&s;e facts are added to tho&s;e above-mentioned, it will not be thought &s;trange, that love between the &s;exes, even among that rude people, was a pure and elevated pa&s;&s;ion. That it was in fact &s;uch, is certain, if hi&s;tory can be credited, or the &s;en|timents of a people expre&s;&s;ed in their poetical compo&s;itions. I begin with the latter, as evidence the mo&s;t to be relied on. The ancient poems of Scandinavia contain the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of love and regard for the female &s;ex. In an ode of King Regner Lodbrog, a very ancient poem, we find the following &s;entiments: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We fought with &s;words upon a promontory of England, when I &s;aw ten thou&s;and of my foes rolling in the du&s;t. A dew of blood di&s;tilled from our &s;words: the arrows, that flew in &s;earch of the helmet, hi&s;&s;ed through the air. The plea&s;ure of that day was like the cla&s;ping a fair virgin in my arms."</Q> Again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A young man &s;hould march early to the conflict of arms; in which con&s;i&s;ts the glory of the warrior. He who a&s;pires to the love of a mi&s;tre&s;s, ought to be dauntle&s;s in the cla&s;h of &s;words."</Q> The&s;e Hyperboreans, it would appear, had early learned to combine the ideas of love and of military prowe&s;s; which is &s;till more con&s;picuous in an ode of Harald the Va|liant, of a later date. That prince, who made a
<PB N="101" REF="105">
figure in the middle of the eleventh century, tra|ver&s;ed all the &s;eas of the north, and made pira|tical incur&s;ions even upon the coa&s;ts of the Medi|terranean. In this ode he complains, that the glory he had acquired made no impre&s;&s;ion on Eli&s;&s;ir, daughter to Jari&s;las, King of Ru&s;&s;ia. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have made the tour of Sicily. My brown ve&s;&s;el, full of mariners, made a &s;wift progre&s;s. My cour&s;e, I thought, would never &s;lacken&mdash;and yet a Ru&s;&s;ian maiden &s;corns me. The troops or Drontheim, which I attacked in my youth, ex|ceeded ours in number. Terrible was the con|flict: I left their young king dead on the field&mdash;and yet a Ru&s;&s;ian maiden &s;corns me. Eight exerci&s;es I can perform: I fight valiantly: firm is my &s;eat on hor&s;eback: inured I am to &s;wim|ming: &s;wift is my motion on &s;cates: I dart the lance: I am &s;kilful at the oar&mdash;and yet a Ru&s;&s;ian maiden &s;corns me. Can &s;he deny, this young and lovely maiden, that near a city in the &s;outh I joined battle, and left behind me la&s;ting monuments of my exploits?&mdash;and yet a Ru&s;&s;ian maiden &s;corns me. My birth was in the high country of Norway, famous for archers: but &s;hips were my delight; and, far from the habitations of men, I have traver&s;ed the &s;eas from north to &s;outh&mdash;and yet a Ru&s;&s;ian maiden &s;corns me."</Q> in the very ancient poem of Ha|vamaal, mentioned above, there are many ex|pre&s;&s;ions of love to the fair-&s;ex. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He who would gain the love of a maiden, mu&s;t addre&s;s her with &s;mooth &s;peeches, and &s;howy gifts. It re|quires good &s;en&s;e to be a &s;kilful lover."</Q> Again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If I a&s;pire to the love of the cha&s;te&s;t virgin, I can bend her mind, and make her yield to my de&s;ires."</Q> The ancient Scandinavian chronicles pre&s;ent often to our view young warriors endea|vouring to acquire the favour of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="102" REF="106">
by boa&s;ting of their accompli&s;hments, &s;uch as their dexterity in &s;wimming and &s;cating, their talent in po|etry, their &s;kill in che&s;s, and their knowing all the &s;tars by name. Mallet, in the Introduction to his Hi&s;tory of Denmark, mentions many ancient Scandinavian novels, that turn upon love and heroi&s;m. The&s;e may be ju&s;tly held as authentic evidence of the manners of the people: it is common to invent facts; but it is not common to attempt the invent|ing manners.</P>
<P>It is an additional proof of the great regard paid to women in Scandinavia, that in Edda, the Scandinavian Bible, female deities make as great a figure as male deities.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the manners de&s;cribed, we find it univer&s;ally admitted among the ancient Scandi|navians, that beauty ought to be the reward of courage and military &s;kill. A warrior was thought intitled to demand in marriage any young wo|man, even of the highe&s;t rank, if he overcame his rivals in &s;ingle combat: nor was it thought any hard&s;hip on the young lady to be yielded to the victor. The ladies were not always of that opini|on; for the &s;toute&s;t fighter is not always the hand|&s;ome&s;t fellow, nor the mo&s;t engaging. And in the Hi&s;tories of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, many in&s;tances are related, of men generou&s;ly interpo&s;|ing to re&s;cue young beauties from brutes, de&s;ti|tute of every accompli&s;hment but &s;trength and boldne&s;s. Such &s;tories have a fabulous air; and many of them probably are mere fables. Some of them, however, have a &s;trong appearance of truth: men are introduced, who make a figure in the real hi&s;tory of the country; and many circum&s;tances are related, that make links in the chain of that hi&s;tory. Take the following &s;pecimen: The am|ba&s;&s;adors of Frotho, King of Denmark, commi&s;|&s;ioned
<PB N="103" REF="107">
to demand in marriage the daughter of a King of the Hunns, were fea&s;ted for three days, as the cu&s;tom was in ancient times; and being ad|mitted to the young Prince&s;s, &s;he rejected the offer: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Becau&s;e,"</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"your King has acquired no reputation in war, but pa&s;&s;es his time effemi|nately at home."</Q> In Biorner's Collection of An|cient Hi&s;torical Monuments, mentioned above, there is the following hi&s;tory: Charles, King of Sweden, kept on foot an army of cho&s;en men. His Queen had borne him a daughter, named Ingue|gerda, who&s;e lively and graceful accompli&s;hments were admired &s;till more than her birth and fortune. The brea&s;t of the King overflowed with felicity. Grymer, a youth of noble birth, knew to dye his &s;word in the blood of his enemies, to run over craggy mountains, to wre&s;tle, to play at che&s;s, and to trace the motions of the &s;tars. He &s;tudied to &s;hew his &s;kill in the apartment of the dam&s;els, be|fore the lovely Inguegerda. At length he ventured to open his mind. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wilt thou, O fair Prince&s;s! accept of me for a hu&s;band, if I obtain the King's con&s;ent?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Go,"</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and &s;up|plicate my father."</Q> The courtly youth, re&s;pect|fully addre&s;&s;ing the King, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O King, give me in marriage thy beautiful daughter."</Q> He an&s;wered &s;ternly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thou ha&s;t learned to handle thy arms: thou ha&s;t acquired &s;ome honourable di&s;tinctions: but ha&s;t thou ever gained a victory, or given a banquet to &s;avage bea&s;ts that re|joice in blood?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where &s;hall I go, O King! that I may dye my &s;word in crim&s;on, and render my&s;elf worthy of being thy &s;on-in-law?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hialmar, &s;on of Harec,"</Q> &s;aid the King, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who governs Biarmland, has become ter|rible by a keen &s;word: the firme&s;t &s;hields he hews in pieces, and loads his followers with booty. Go, and prove thy valour, by attack|ing

that hero: cau&s;e him to bite the du&s;t, and Inguegerda &s;hall be thy reward."</Q> Grymer, re|turning to his fair mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aluted her with ardent looks of love. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What an&s;wer ha&s;t thou received from the King?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To obtain thee I mu&s;t deprive the fierce Hialmar of life."</Q> Ingue|gerda exclaimed with grief, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Alas! my fa|ther hath devoted thee to death."</Q> Grymer &s;e|lected a troop of brave warriors, eager to follow him. They launch their ve&s;&s;els into the wide ocean: they unfurl their &s;ails, which catch the &s;pringing gale: the &s;hrowds rattle: the waves foam, and da&s;h again&s;t the prows: they &s;teer their numerous ve&s;&s;els to the &s;hore of Gothland; bent to glut the hungry raven, and to gorge the wolf with prey. Thus landed Grymer on Gothland: and thus did a beauteous maiden occa&s;ion the death of many heroes. Hialmar demanded who the &s;trangers were. Grymer told his name; adding, that he had &s;pent the &s;ummer in que&s;t of him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"May your arrival,"</Q> replied Hialmar, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"be fortunate; and may health and honour attend you! You &s;hall partake of my gold, with the unmixed juice of the grape. Thy offers, &s;aid Grymer, I dare not accept. Prepare for battle; and let us ha&s;ten to give a banquet to bea&s;ts of prey. Hialmar laid hold of his white cuira&s;s, his &s;word, and his buckler. Grymer, with a violent blow of his &s;abre, transfixes Hialmar's &s;hield, and cuts off his left hand. Hialmar, enraged, brandi&s;hes his &s;word, and &s;triking off Grymer's helmet and cuira&s;s, pierces his brea&s;t and &s;ides; an effu&s;ion of blood following the wounds. Grymer, rai&s;|ing his &s;abre with both hands, lays Hialmar pro|&s;trate on the ground; and he him&s;elf &s;inks down upon the dead body of his adver&s;ary. He was put on &s;hip-board, and &s;eemed to be at the la&s;t period of life when he landed. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Prince&s;s
<PB N="105" REF="109">
undertook his cure, and re&s;tored him to health. They were married with great &s;olemnity, and the beauteous bride of Grymer filled the heart of her hero with unfading joy."</Q></P>
<P>According to the rude manners of tho&s;e times, a lover did not always wait for the con&s;ent of his mi&s;|tre&s;s. Joannes Magnus, Archbi&s;hop of Up&s;al, ob|&s;erves, in his hi&s;tory of the Goths, that ravi&s;hing of women was of old no le&s;s frequent among the Scandinavians than among the Greeks. He relates, that Gram, &s;on to the King of Denmark, carried off the King of Sweden's daughter, who&s;e beauty was celebrated in ver&s;es exi&s;ting even in his time. Another in&s;tance he gives, of Nicolaus King of Denmark<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Book 18.</NOTE>, who courted Uluilda, a noble and beautiful Norvegian lady, and obtained her con&s;ent. Nothing remained but the celebration of the nupti|als, when &s;he was carried off by Suercher, King of Sweden. We have the authority of Saxo Gram|maticus, that Skiold, one of the fir&s;t Kings of Denmark, fought a duel for a beautiful young wo|man, and obtained her for a wife. That author relates many duels of the &s;ame kind. It was indeed common among the Scandinavians, before they be|came Chri&s;tians, to fight for a wife, and to carry off the de&s;ired object by force of arms. No cau&s;e of war between neighbouring kings was more fre|quent. Fridlevus King of Denmark &s;ent a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y to Ha&s;mundus King of Norway, to de|mand in marriage his daughter. Ha&s;mundus had a rooted aver&s;ion to the Danes, who had done much mi&s;chief in his country. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Go,"</Q> &s;ays he to the am|ba&s;&s;adors, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and demand a wife where you are le&s;s hated than in Norway."</Q> The young lady, who had no aver&s;ion to the match, intreated leave to

&s;peak. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You &s;eem,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not to con&s;ult the good of your kingdom in rejecting &s;o potent a &s;on-in-law, who can carry by force what he is now applying for by intreaties."</Q> The father however continuing ob&s;tinate, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the amba&s;|&s;adors. Fridlevus &s;ent other amba&s;&s;adors, redoub|ling his intreaties for a favourable an&s;wer. Ha&s;|mundus &s;aid, that one refu&s;al might be thought &s;ufficient; and in a fit of pa&s;&s;ion put the amba&s;&s;a|dors to death. Fridlevus invaded Norway with a potent army; and, after a de&s;perate battle, carried off the lady in triumph.</P>
<P>The figure that women made in the north of Europe by their courage, their beauty, and their cha&s;tity, could not fail to produce mutual e&s;teem and love between the &s;exes: nor could that love fail to be purified into the mo&s;t tender affection, when their rough manners were &s;moothed in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety. If love between the &s;exes pre|vail in Lapland as much as any where, which is vouched by Scheffer in his hi&s;tory of that country, it mu&s;t be for a rea&s;on very different from that now mentioned. The males in Lapland, who are great cowards, have no rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e the females for their timidity; and in every country where the wo|men equal the men, mutual e&s;teem and affection naturally take place. Two Lapland odes commu|nicated to us by the author mentioned, leave no doubt of this fact, being full of the tendere&s;t &s;enti|ments that love can in&s;pire. The following is a literal tran&s;lation.</P>

<P>In the Scandinavian manners here de&s;cribed is di&s;|covered a &s;triking re&s;emblance to tho&s;e de&s;cribed by O&s;&s;ian. And as &s;uch were the manners of the Scan|dinavians in the fir&s;t &s;tage of &s;ociety, it no longer remains a wonder, that the manners of Caledonia &s;hould be equally pure in the &s;ame early period. And now every argument above urged in favour of O&s;&s;ian as a genuine hi&s;torian has its full weight, without the lea&s;t counterpoi&s;e. It is true, that Ca|ledonian manners appear from O&s;&s;ian to have been &s;till more poli&s;hed and refined than tho&s;e of Scandi|navia; but that difference may have proceeded from many cau&s;es, which time has buried in ob|livion.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="114">
I make no apology for in&s;i&s;ting &s;o largely on Scan|dinavian manners; for they tend remarkably to &s;up|port the credit of O&s;&s;ian, and con&s;equently to a&s;cer|tain a fact extremely intere&s;ting, that our forefa|thers were by no means &s;uch barbarians as they are commonly held to be. All the inhabitants of Britain were of Celtic extraction; and we have rea&s;on to believe, that the manners of Caledonia were the manners of every part of the i&s;land, before the in|habitants of the plains were en&s;laved by the Ro|mans. The only circum&s;tance peculiar to the Caledonians, is their mountainous &s;ituation: being le&s;s expo&s;ed to the oppre&s;&s;ion of foreigners, and far|ther removed from commerce, they did longer than their &s;outhern neighbours pre&s;erve their manners pure and untainted.</P>
<P>I have all along con&s;idered the poems of O&s;&s;ian merely in an hi&s;torical view. In the view of critici&s;m they have been examined by a writer of di&s;tingui&s;h|ed ta&s;te<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Doctor Blair, profe&s;&s;or of Rhetoric in the college of Edinburgh.</NOTE>; and however bold to enter a field where he hath reaped laurels, I imagine that there &s;till remain &s;ome trifles for me to glean. Two of the&s;e poems, Fingal and Temora, are regular epic po|ems; and perhaps the &s;ingle in&s;tances of epic poetry moulded into the form of an opera. We have in the&s;e two poems both the Recitativo and Aria of an Italian opera; dropped indeed in the tran&s;lation, from difficulty of imitation. O&s;&s;ian's poems were all of them compo&s;ed with a view to mu&s;ic; though in the long poems mentioned it is probable, that the airs only were accompanied with the harp, the recitative being left to the voice. The poems of O&s;&s;ian are &s;ingular in another re&s;pect, being pro|bably the only work now remaining that was com|po&s;ed
<PB N="111" REF="115">
in the hunter-&s;tate. Some &s;ongs of that early period may po&s;&s;ibly be remaining, but nothing like a regular work. One may advance a &s;tep farther, and pronounce, with a high degree of probability, that Fingal and Temora are the only epic poems that ever were compo&s;ed in that &s;tate. How great mu&s;t have been the talents of the author, be&s;et with every ob&s;truction to genius, the manners of his country alone excepted; a cold unho&s;pitable cli|mate, with &s;uch deformity on the face of the coun|try as &s;carce to afford a plea&s;ing object; and he him&s;elf ab&s;olutely illiterate! One, advancing &s;till farther, may venture boldly to affirm, that &s;uch a poem as Fingal or Temora never was compo&s;ed in any other part of the world under &s;uch di&s;advanta|geous circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Tho' permanent manners enter not regularly in|to the pre&s;ent &s;ketch, I am however tempted to add a few words concerning the influence of &s;oil upon the di&s;po&s;ition of man, in order to &s;how the wi&s;dom of Providence, which fits the ground we tread on, not only for &s;upplying our wants, but for improving our manners. The &s;tupidity of the inhabitants of New Holland, mentioned above, is occa&s;ioned by the barrenne&s;s of their &s;oil, yielding nothing that can be food for man or bea&s;t. Day and night they watch the ebb of the tide, in order to dig &s;mall fi&s;h out of the &s;and; and &s;leep in the intervals, without an hour to &s;pare for any other occupation. People in that condition mu&s;t for ever remain ignorant and bruti&s;h. Were all the earth barren like New Hol|land, all men would be ignorant and bruti&s;h, like the inhabitants of New Holland. On the other hand, were every portion of this earth naturally &s;o fertile as &s;pontaneou&s;ly to feed all its inhabitants, which is the golden age figured by poets, what would follow? Upon the former &s;uppo&s;ition, man
<PB N="112" REF="116">
would be a meagre, patient, and timid animal: upon the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, he would be pampered, lazy, and effeminate. In both ca&s;es, he would be &s;tupidly ignorant, and incapable of any manly exer|tion, whether of mind or body. But the &s;oil of our earth is more wi&s;ely accommodated to man, its chief inhabitant. Taking it general, it is neither &s;o fertile as to &s;uper&s;ede labour, nor &s;o barren as to require our whole labour. The laborious occupa|tion of hunting for food produced originally &s;ome degree of indu&s;try: and though all the indu&s;try of man was at fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for procuring food, cloath|ing, and habitation; yet the &s;oil, by &s;kill in agri|culture, came to produce plenty with le&s;s labour, which to &s;ome afforded &s;pare time for thinking of conveniences. A habit of indu&s;try thus acquired excited many to be&s;tow their lei&s;ure-hours upon the arts, proceeding from u&s;eful arts to fine arts, and from the&s;e to the &s;ciences. Wealth, accumulated by indu&s;try, has a wonderful influence upon man|ners: feuds and war, the offspring of wealth, call forth into action friend&s;hip, courage, heroi&s;m, and every &s;ocial virtue, as well as many &s;elfi&s;h vices. How like brutes do we pa&s;s our time, without once reflecting on the conduct of Providence operating even under our feet!</P>
<P>Diver&s;ity of manners, at the &s;ame time, enters into the plan of Providence, as well as diver&s;ity of talents, of feelings, and of opinions. Our Maker hath given us a ta&s;te for variety; and he hath pro|vided objects in plenty for its gratification. Some &s;oils, naturally fertile, require little labour: &s;ome &s;oils, naturally barren, require the extremity of labour. But the advantages of &s;uch a &s;oil are more than &s;ufficient to counterbalance its barrenne&s;s: the inhabitants are &s;ober, indu&s;trious, vigorous; and con&s;equently courageous, &s;o far as courage depends
<PB N="113" REF="117">
on bodily &s;trength<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That a barren country is a great &s;pur to indu&s;try, appears from Venice and Genoa in Italy. Nuremberg in Germany, and Limoges in France. The &s;terility of Holland required all the indu&s;try of its inhabitants for procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and by that means chiefly they become remarkably indu&s;trious. Cambden a&s;cribes the &s;ucce&s;s of the town of Halifax in the cloth|manufacture, to its barren &s;oil.</NOTE>. The di&s;advantages of a fer|tile &s;oil, on the contrary, are more than &s;ufficient to counterbalance its advantages: the inhabitants are rendered indolent, weak, and cowardly. Hin|do&s;tan may &s;eem to be an exception; for though it be extremely fertile, the people however are indu&s;|trious, and export manufactures in great abundance at a very low price. But Hindo&s;tan properly is not an exception. The Hindows, who are prohibited by their religion to kill any living creature, mu&s;t abandon to animals for food a large proportion of land; which obliges them to cultivate what remains with double indu&s;try, in order to procure food for them&s;elves. The populou&s;ne&s;s of their country con|tributes al&s;o to make them indu&s;trious. Arragon was once the mo&s;t limited monarchy in Europe, England not excepted: the barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil was the cau&s;e, which rendered the people hardy and courageous. In a preamble to one of their laws, the &s;tates declare, that were they not more free than other nations, the barrenne&s;s of their coun|try would tempt them to abandon it. Oppo&s;ed to Arragon &s;tands Egypt, the fertility of which ren|ders the inhabitants &s;oft and effeminate, and con&s;e|quently an ea&s;y prey to every invader<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fear, impre&s;&s;ed by &s;trange and unfore&s;een accidents, is the mo&s;t potent cau&s;e of &s;uper&s;tition. What then made the ancient Egyptians &s;o &s;uper&s;titious? No other country is le&s;s liable to &s;trange and unfore&s;een accidents: no thunder, &s;carce any rain, perfect regularity in the &s;ea&s;ons, and in the ri&s;e and fall of the river. So little notion had the Egyptians of variable weather as to be &s;urpri&s;ed that the rivers of Greece did not overflow like the Nile. They could not comprehend how their fields were watered: rain, they &s;aid, was very irregular; and what if Jupiter &s;hould take a conceit to &s;end them no rain? The fertility of the &s;oil, and the inaction of the inhabitants during the inundation of the river, enervat|ed both mind and body, and rendered them timid and pu&s;illanimous. Super&s;tition was the offspring of this character, as it is of &s;trange and unfore&s;een accidents in other countries.</NOTE>. The

fruitfulne&s;s of the province of Quito in Peru, and the low price of every nece&s;&s;ary, occa&s;ioned by its di&s;tance from the &s;ea, have plunged the inhabitants into &s;upine indolence, and exce&s;&s;ive luxury. The people of the town of Quito in particular have aban|doned them&s;elves to every &s;ort of debauchery. The time they have to &s;pare from wine and women is employed in exce&s;&s;ive gaming. In other re&s;pects al&s;o the manners of a people are influenced by the country they inhabit. A great part of Calabria, formerly populous and fertile, is at pre&s;ent covered with trees and &s;hrubs, like the wilds of America; and the ferocity of its inhabitants corre&s;pond to the rudene&s;s of the fields. The &s;ame is vi&s;ible in the inhabitants of Mount Etna in Sicily: the country and its inhabitants are equally rugged.</P>

<P>THE wi&s;dom of Providence is in no in&s;tance more con&s;picuous than in adju&s;ting the con|&s;titution of man to his external circum&s;tances. Food is extremely precarious in the hunter-&s;tate; &s;ome|times &s;uperabounding with little fatigue, &s;ometimes failing after great fatigue. A &s;avage, like other ani|mals of prey, has a &s;tomach adju&s;ted to that varie|ty: he can bear a long fa&s;t; and gorges voraciou&s;|ly when he has plenty, without being the wor&s;e for it. Whence it is, that barbarians, who have &s;carce any &s;en&s;e of decency, are great and gro&s;s feeders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Iliad of Homer, book. 9 Agamemnon calls a council at night in his tent. Before entering on bu&s;i|ne&s;s. they go to &s;upper, (line 122.). An emba&s;&s;y to Achilles is re&s;olved on. The amba&s;&s;adors again &s;up with Achilles on pork-gri&s;kins, (line 271.) Achilles rejects Agamemnon's offer; and the &s;ame night Uly&s;&s;es and Diomed &s;et out on their expedition to the Trojan camp: returning before day, they had a third &s;upper.</NOTE>. They are equally addicted to drunkenne&s;s; and pe|culiarly fond of &s;pirituous liquors. Drinking was a fa&s;hionable vice in Greece, when Menander, Phi|lemon, and Diphilus, wrote, if we can rely on the tran&s;lations or imitations of tho&s;e writers by Plautus and Terence. Diodorus Siculus reports, that in his time the Gauls, like other barbarians, were much addicted to drinking. The ancient Scandinavians, who, like other &s;avages, were intemperate in eating and drinking, &s;wallowed large cups to their gods,
<PB N="116" REF="120">
and to &s;uch of their countrymen as had fallen brave|ly in battle. We learn from the 25th fable of the Edda, which was their &s;acred book, that to hold much liquor was reputed an heroic virtue. Coata|rini the Venetian amba&s;&s;ador, who wrote ann. 1473, &s;ays, that the Ru&s;&s;ians were abandoned to drunkenne&s;s; and that the whole race would have been extirpated, had not &s;trong liquors been di&s;|charged by the &s;overeign. The Kam&s;katkans love fat; and a man entertains his gue&s;ts by cramming into their mouths fat &s;lices of a &s;eal, or a whale, cutting off with his knife what hangs out.</P>
<P>A habit of fa&s;ting long, acquired as above in the hunter-&s;tate, made meals in the &s;hepherd-&s;tate le&s;s frequent than at pre&s;ent, though food was at hand. Anciently people fed but once a-day, a fa&s;hion that continued even after luxury was indulged in other re&s;pects. In the war of Xerxes again&s;t Greece, it was plea&s;antly &s;aid of the Abderites, who were bur|dened with providing for the King's table, that they ought to thank the gods for not inclining Xerxes to eat twice a-day. Plato held the Sicilians to be glut|tons for having two meals a-day. Arrian<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4. cap. 16.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, that the Tyrrhenians had a bad habit of two meals a-day. In the reign of Henry VI. the people of England fed but twice a-day. Hector Boyes, in his hi&s;tory of Scotland, exclaiming again&s;t the growing luxury of his cotemporaries, &s;ays, that &s;ome per&s;ons were &s;o gluttonous as to have three meals a-day.</P>
<P>Luxury undoubtedly, and love of &s;ociety, tended to increa&s;e the number of meals beyond what na|ture requires. On the other hand, there is a cau&s;e that abridged the number for &s;ome time, which is, the introduction of machines. Bodily &s;trength is e&s;&s;ential to a &s;avage, being his only tool; and with
<PB N="117" REF="121">
it he performs wonders. Machines have rendered bodily &s;trength of little importance; and as men labour le&s;s than originally, they eat le&s;s in propor|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before fire-arms were known, people gloried in addre&s;s and bodily &s;trength, and commonly fought hand to hand. But violent exerci&s;es becoming le&s;s and le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, went in&s;en&s;ibly out of fa&s;hion.</NOTE>. Li&s;ten to Hollin&s;hed the Engli&s;h hi&s;torian upon that article: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Heretofore there hath been much more time &s;pent in eating and drinking than commonly is in the&s;e days; for whereas of old we had breakfa&s;ts in the forenoon, be|verages or nuntions after dinner, and thereto rear &s;uppers when it was time to go to re&s;t; now the&s;e odd repa&s;ts, thanked be God, are very well left, and each one contenteth him&s;elf with dinner and &s;upper only."</Q> Thus, before cookery and luxury crept in, a moderate &s;tomach, occa&s;ioned by the abridging bodily labour, made eating le&s;s frequent than formerly. But the mo|tion did not long continue retrograde: good cook|ery, and the plea&s;ure of eating in company, turn|ed the tide; and people now eat le&s;s at a time, but more frequently.</P>
<P>Fea&s;ts in former times were carried beyond all bounds. William of Malm&s;bury, who wrote in the days of Henry II. &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Engli&s;h were univer&s;ally addicted to drunkenne&s;s, conti|nuing over their cups day and night, keeping open hou&s;e, and &s;pending the income of their e&s;tates in riotous fea&s;ts, where eating and drink|ing were carried to exce&s;s, without any ele|gance."</Q> People who live in a corner imagine, that every thing is peculiar to them&s;elves: what Malm&s;bury &s;ays of the Engli&s;h, is common to all nations, in advancing from the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of &s;avages to a reli&s;h for &s;ociety, but who have not yet learn|ed
<PB N="118" REF="122">
to bridle their appetites. Leland<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cellectanea.</NOTE> mentions a fea&s;t given by the Archbi&s;hop of York at his in&s;tallation, in the reign of Edward IV. The following is a &s;pecimen: 300 quarters of wheat, 300 tons of ale, 100 tons of wine, 1000 &s;heep, 104 oxen, 304 calves, 304 &s;wine, 2000 gee&s;e, 1000 capons, 2000 pigs, 400 &s;wans, 104 peacocks, 1500 hot veni&s;on pa&s;ties, 4000 cold, 5000 cu&s;|tards hot and cold. Such entertainments are a picture of manners. At that early period, there was not di&s;covered in &s;ociety any plea&s;ure but that of crouding together in hunting and fea&s;ting. The delicate plea&s;ures of conver&s;ation, in communi|cating opinions, &s;entiments, and de&s;ires, were to them utterly unknown. There appeared, how|ever, even at that early period, a faint dawn of the fine arts. In &s;uch fea&s;ts as are mentioned above, a curious de&s;ert was &s;ometimes exhibited, termed SUTTEITIE, viz. pa&s;te moulded into the &s;hape of animals. On a &s;aint's day, angels, prophets, and patriarchs were &s;et on the table in plenty. A fea&s;t given by Trivultius to Lewis XII. of France, in the city of Milan, makes a figure in Italian hi&s;|tory. No fewer than 1200 ladies were invited; and the Cardinals of Narbon and St. Severin, with many other prelates, were among the dancers. After dancing followed the fea&s;t, to regulate which there were no fewer employed than 160 ma&s;ter|hou&s;eholds. Twelve hundred officers, in an uni|form of velvet, or &s;atin, carried the victuals, and &s;erved at the &s;ide-board. Every table, without di&s;tinction, was &s;erved with &s;ilver plate, engraved with the arms of the landlord; and, be&s;ide a pro|digious number of Italian lords, the whole court, and all the hou&s;ehold of the King, were fea&s;ted. The bill of-fare of an entertainment given by Sir

Watkin Williams Wynn to a company of 1500 per&s;ons, on his coming of age, is a &s;ample of an|cient Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality, which appears to have nothing in view but crouding and cramming merely. The following pa&s;&s;age is from Hollin&s;hed: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the length and &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of fea&s;ts formerly in u&s;e, are not totally left off in England, not|with&s;tanding that it proveth very beneficial to the phy&s;icians, who mo&s;t abound where mo&s;t exce&s;s and mi&s;government of our bodies do ap|pear."</Q> He adds, that claret, and other French wines, were de&s;pi&s;ed, and &s;trong wines only in re|que&s;t. The be&s;t, he &s;ays, were to be found in mona&s;teries; for <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the merchant would have thought his &s;oul would go &s;traightway to the devil, if he &s;hould &s;erve monks with other than the be&s;t."</Q> Our forefathers reli&s;hed &s;trong wine, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that their forefathers reli&s;hed brandy. In Scotland, &s;umptuous entertainments were common at marriages, bapti&s;ms, and burials. In the reign of Charles II. a &s;tatute was thought nece&s;&s;ary to confine them within moderate bounds.</P>
<P>Of old, there was much eating, with little va|riety: at pre&s;ent, there is great variety, with more moderation. From a hou&s;hold-book of the Earl of Northumberland, in the reign of Henry VIII. it appears, that his family, during winter, fed mo&s;tly on &s;alt meat, and &s;alt fi&s;h; and with that view there was an appointment of 160 gallons of mu&s;tard. On fle&s;h-days through the year, break|fa&s;t for my Lord and Lady was a loaf of bread, two manchets, a quart of beer, a quart of wine, half a chine of mutton, or a chine of beef boiled. On meagre days, a loaf of bread, two manchets, a quart of beer, a quart of wine, a di&s;h of butter, a piece of &s;alt fi&s;h, or a di&s;h of buttered eggs. Dur|ing lent, a loaf of bread, two manchets, a quart of beer, a quart of wine, two pieces of &s;alt fi&s;h, &s;ix
<PB N="120" REF="124">
bacon'd herring, four white herring, or a di&s;h of &s;proits. There was as little variety in the other meals, except on fe&s;tival-days. That way of liv|ing was at the time high luxury: a lady's waiting|woman at pre&s;ent w uld never have done with grumbling at &s;uch a table. We learn from the &s;ame book, that the Earl had but two cooks for dre&s;&s;ing victuals to more than two hundred dome&s;|tics. In tho&s;e days, hen, chicken, capon, pigeon, plover, partridge, were reckoned &s;uch delicacies, as to be prohibited except at my Lord's table<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hou&s;ehold-book above mentioned.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But luxury is always creeping on, and delicacies become more familiar. Hollin&s;hed ob&s;erves, that white meats, milk, butter, and chee&s;e, formerly the chief food of his countrymen, were in his time degraded to be the food of the lower &s;ort; and that the wealthy fed upon fle&s;h and fi&s;h. By a roll of the King of Scotland's hou&s;ehold-expence, anno 1378, we find, that the art of gelding cattle was known. The roll is in Latin, and the gelt hogs are termed porcelli eunuchi. Mention is al&s;o made of chickens, which were not common on Engli&s;h tables at that time. Olive oil is al&s;o mentioned.</P>
<P>In this progre&s;s, cooks, we may believe, came to make a figure. Hollin&s;hed ob&s;erves, that the nobility, rejecting their own cookery, employ'd as cooks mu&s;ical-headed Frenchmen and &s;trangers, as he terms them. He &s;ays, that even merchants, when they gave a fea&s;t, rejected butcher's meat as unworthy of their tables; having jellies of all co|lours, and in all figures, repre&s;enting flowers, trees, bea&s;ts, fi&s;h, fowl, and fruit. Henry Wardlaw Archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, ob&s;erving the refine|ments in cookery introduced by James I. of Scot|land, who had been eighteen years a pri&s;oner in England, exclaimed again&s;t the abu&s;e in a parlia|ment
<PB N="121" REF="125">
held at Perth 1433: he obtained a law, re|&s;training &s;uperfluous diet; and prohibiting the u&s;e of baked meat to any under the degree of gentle|men, and permitting it to gentlemen on fe&s;tival-days only; which baked meat, &s;ays the bi&s;hop, was never before &s;een in Scotland. The pea&s;ants in Sicily regale them&s;elves with ice during &s;ummer. They &s;ay, that a &s;carcity of &s;now would be more grievous to them than a &s;carcity of corn, or of wine. Such progre&s;s has luxury made, even among the populace. People of fa&s;hion in London and in Paris, who employ their whole thoughts on luxu|rious living, would be &s;urpri&s;ed to be told, that they are &s;till deficient in that art. In order to advance luxury of the table to the ACME of perfection, there ought to be a cook for every di&s;h, as there was in ancient Egypt a phy&s;ician for every di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Barbarous nations, being great eaters, are fond of large joints of meat: and love of &s;how retains great joints in fa&s;hion, even after meals become more moderate: a wild boar was roa&s;ted whole for a &s;upper-di&s;h to Antony and Cleopatra; and when &s;tuffed with poultry and wild-fowl, it was a favou|rite di&s;h at Rome, termed the Trojan boar, in al|lu&s;ion to the Trojan hor&s;e. The ho&s;pitality of the Anglo-Saxons was &s;ometimes exerted in roa&s;ting an ox whole. Great joints are left off gradually, as people become more and more delicate in eating. In France, great joints are le&s;s in u&s;e than former|ly; and in England, the voluminous &s;urloin of roa&s;t beef, formerly the pride of the nation, is now in polite families relegated to the &s;ide-board. In China, where manners are carried to a high degree of refinement, di&s;hes are compo&s;ed entirely of minc|ed meat.</P>
<P>In early times, people were no le&s;s plain in their hou&s;es than in their food. Toward the end of the &s;ixteenth century, when Hollin&s;hed wrote, the
<PB N="122" REF="126">
people of England were beginning to build with brick and &s;tone. Formerly hou&s;es were made of po&s;ts wattled together, and plai&s;tered with clay to keep out the cold: the roof was &s;traw, &s;edge, or reed. It was an ob&s;ervation of a Spaniard in Queen Mary's days, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The&s;e Engli&s;h have their hou&s;es of &s;ticks and dirt, but they fare as well as the King."</Q> Hollin&s;hed mentioning multitudes of chimnies lately erected, ob&s;erves, upon the autho|rity of &s;ome old men, that in their younger days there were not above two or three, if &s;o many, in mo&s;t uplandi&s;h towns of the realm, religious hou&s;es and manor-places of their lords excepted; but that each made his fire again&s;t a rere-do&s;&s;e in the hall, where he dined, and dre&s;&s;ed his meat. From Lord Northumberland's hou&s;ehold-book, it would &s;eem, that grates were unknown at that time, and that they burnt their coal upon the hearth: a certain &s;um is allotted for purcha&s;ing wood; becau&s;e, &s;ays the book, coals will not burn without it. There is al&s;o a certain &s;um allotted for purcha&s;ing char|coal, that the &s;moke of the &s;ea-coal might not hurt the arras. In the fourteenth century, the hou&s;es of private per&s;ons in Paris, as well as in London, were of wood. The &s;treets of Paris, not being paved, were covered with mud; and yet for a woman to travel tho&s;e &s;treets in a cart, was held an article of luxury, and as &s;uch prohibited by Philip the Fair. Paris is enlarged two thirds &s;ince the death of Henry IV. tho' at that time it was perhaps not much le&s;s populous than at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>They were equally plain in their hou&s;ehold-fur|niture. While money was &s;carce, &s;ervants got land in&s;tead of wages. An old tenure in England binds the va&s;&s;al to find &s;traw for the King's bed, and hay for his hor&s;e. From Lord Northumber|land's hou&s;ehold-book, mentioned above, it ap|pears, that the linen allowed for a whole year
<PB N="123" REF="127">
amounted to no more than &s;eventy ells; of which there were to be eight table-cloths (no napkins) for his Lord&s;hip's table, and two towels for wa&s;hing his face and hands. Pewter ve&s;&s;el was prohibited to be hired, except on Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, St. George's day, and Whit&s;unday. Hollin&s;hed men|tions his conver&s;ing with old men who remarked many alterations in England within their remem|brance; that their fathers, and they them&s;elves formerly, had nothing to &s;leep on but a &s;traw pal|lat, with a log of timber for a pillow; a pillow, &s;aid they, being thought meet only for a woman in childbed; and that if a man in &s;even years after marriage could purcha&s;e a flock-bed, and a &s;ack of chaff to re&s;t his head upon, he thought him&s;elf as well lodged as the lord of the town; who, perad|venture, lay &s;eldom on a bed entirely of feathers. Another thing they remarked, was change of hou&s;e|hold-ve&s;&s;el from timber plates into pewter, and from wooden &s;poons into tin or &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Nor were they le&s;s plain in their dre&s;s. By an act of parliament in Scotland, anno 1429, none were permitted to wear &s;ilk or co&s;tly furs, but knights and lords of 200 merks yearly rent. But luxury in dre&s;s advanced &s;o fa&s;t, that by another act, anno 1457, the &s;ame dre&s;s was permitted to aldermen, bailies, and other good worthy men within burgh. And by a third act, anno 1471, it was permitted to gentlemen of L. 100 yearly rent. By a &s;umptuary law in Scotland, anno 1621, cloth of gold and &s;ilver, gold and &s;ilver lace, velvet, &s;atin, and other &s;ilk &s;tuffs, were prohibited, except to noblemen, their wives and children, to lords of parliament, prelates, privy coun&s;ellors, lords of manors, judges, magi&s;trates of towns, and to tho&s;e who have 6000 merks of yearly rent. Such di&s;|tinctions, with re&s;pect to landed rent e&s;pecially, are invidious; nor can they ever be kept up.

<P>During the reign of Edward III. the imports into England were not the &s;eventh part of the exports.

<P>Men in different ages differ widely in their no|tions of luxury: every new object of &s;en&s;ual grati|fication, and every indulgence beyond what is u&s;ual, are commonly termed luxury; and cea&s;e to be luxury when they turn habitual.

<P>Thus every one exclaims again&s;t the luxury of the pre&s;ent times, judging more favourably of the pa&s;t; as if what is luxury at pre&s;ent, would cea&s;e to be luxury when it becomes cu&s;tomary. What is the foundation of a &s;entiment &s;o univer&s;al? In point of dignity, corporeal plea&s;ures are the lowe&s;t of all that belong to our nature: and for that rea&s;on, per&s;ons of delicacy di&s;&s;emble the plea&s;ure they take in eating and drinking<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 1. p. 356. edit. 5.</NOTE>. When corporeal plea|&s;ure is indulged to exce&s;s, it is not only low, but mean. But as in judging of things that admit of degrees, compari&s;on is the ordinary &s;tandard, every refinement in corporeal plea&s;ure beyond what is cu&s;|tomary, is held to be an exce&s;s, blameable as below the dignity of human nature. Thus every improve|ment in living is pronounced to be luxury while re|cent, and drops that character when it comes into common u&s;e. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, what is mode|ration in the capitol, is e&s;teemed luxury in a coun|try town. Doth luxury then depend entirely on compari&s;on? is there no other foundation for di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
<PB N="129" REF="133">
moderation from exce&s;s? This will hardly be maintained.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject is thrown into ob&s;curity by giving different meanings to the term luxury. A French writer holds every &s;ort of food to be luxury, but raw fle&s;h and acorns, which were the original food of &s;avages; and every &s;ort of covering to be luxury but &s;kins, which were their original cloathing. Ac|cording to that definition, the plough, the &s;pade, the loom, are all of them in&s;truments of luxury; and in that view he ju&s;tly extols luxury to the &s;kies. Let every man enjoy the privilege of giving his own meaning to words: at the &s;ame time, when a man deviates &s;o far from their u&s;ual meaning, the neglect to define them is inexcu&s;able. In common lan|guage, and in common apprehen&s;ion, luxury al|ways implies a faulty exce&s;s; and upon that account is condemned by all writers, &s;uch only excepted as affect to be &s;ingular.</P>
<P>This is clearly one branch of the definition of luxury. Another is, that the exce&s;s mu&s;t be habi|tual: a &s;ingle act of intemperance, however faulty, is not denominated luxury: reiteration mu&s;t be &s;o frequent as to become a confirmed habit.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e particulars all that enter into the definition of luxury. There are many plea&s;ures, however intemperate or habitual, that are not brand|ed with that odious name. Mental plea&s;ure, &s;uch as ari&s;es from &s;entiment or rea&s;oning, falls not with|in the verge of luxury, to whatever exce&s;s indulged. If to relieve merit in di&s;tre&s;s be luxury, it is only &s;o in a metaphorical &s;en&s;e: nor is it deemed luxury in a dam&s;el of fifteen to peru&s;e love-novels from morn|ing to evening. Luxury is confined to the external &s;en&s;es: nor does it belong to every one of the&s;e; the fine arts have no relation to luxury. A man is not even &s;aid to be luxurious, merely for indulging in dre&s;s, or in fine furniture. Hollin&s;hed inveighs

again&s;t drinking-gla&s;&s;es as an article of luxury. At that rate, a hou&s;e adorned with fine pictures or &s;ta|tues would be an imputation on the proprietor. Thus pa&s;&s;ing in review every plea&s;ure of external &s;en&s;e, we find, that in proper language the term luxury is not applicable to any plea&s;ure of the eye or ear. That term is confined to the plea&s;ures of ta&s;te, touch, and &s;mell, which appear as exi&s;ting at the organ of &s;en&s;e, and upon that account are held to be merely corporeal<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Elements of Critici&s;m, Introduction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having thus circum&s;cribed our &s;ubject within its proper bounds, the important point that remains to be a&s;certained is, Whether we have any rule for determining what exce&s;s in corporeal plea&s;ure may ju&s;tly be denominated faulty. About that point we are at no lo&s;s. Though our pre&s;ent life be a &s;tate of trial, yet our Maker has kindly indulged us in every plea&s;ure that is not hurtful to the mind, or to the body; and therefore it can only be hurtful ex|ce&s;s that falls under the cen&s;ure of being luxurious. It is faulty as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of &s;elf-duty; and as &s;uch it is condemned by the moral &s;en&s;e. The mo&s;t violent declaimer again&s;t luxury will not affirm, that bread is luxury, or a &s;now-ball u&s;ed for a pillow; for the&s;e are innocent, becau&s;e they do no harm. As little will it be affirmed, that dwelling-hou&s;es more capacious than tho&s;e originally built ought to be condemned as luxury, &s;ince they contribute to chearfulne&s;s as well as to health. The plague, &s;ome centuries ago, made frequent vi&s;its in London, promoted by air &s;tagnating in narrow &s;treets, and &s;mall hou&s;es. After the great fire anno 1666, the hou&s;es and &s;treets were enlarged, and the plague has not once been known in London.</P>

other &s;uffers. In order to have <Q REND="inline">"mens &s;ana in corpore &s;ano,"</Q> it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy the health of both: bodily health &s;upports the mind; and nothing tends more than chearfulne&s;s to &s;upport the body, even under a di&s;ea&s;e. To pre&s;erve this complicated ma|chine in order, certain exerci&s;es are proper for the body, and certain for the mind; which ought ne|ver to encroach the one on the other. Much mo|tion and bodily exerci&s;e tend to make us robu&s;t; but in the mean time the mind is &s;tarved: much reading and reflection &s;ortify the mind, but in the mean time the body is &s;tarved. Nor is this all: exce&s;s in either is de&s;tructive to both; for exerci&s;e too violent, whether of mind or body, wears the machine. Indolence, on the other hand, relaxes the machine, and renders it weak or languid. Bo|dily indolence breeds the gout, the gravel, and ma|ny other di&s;ea&s;es: nor is mental indolence le&s;s per|nicious, for it breeds peevi&s;hne&s;s and pu&s;illanimity. Thus health both of mind and body is be&s;t pre&s;erved by moderate exerci&s;e. And hence a general propo|&s;ition, That every indulgence in corporeal plea&s;ure, which favours either too violent or too languid ex|erci&s;e, whether of mind or body, is hurtful, and con&s;equently is luxury in its proper &s;en&s;e. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to be added, that every &s;uch indul|gence is condemned by the moral &s;en&s;e; for every man can bear te&s;timony of this from what he him|&s;elf feels.</P>
<P>Too great indulgence in corporeal plea&s;ure &s;eldom prompts violent exerci&s;e; but in&s;tances are without number of its relaxing even that moderate degree of exerci&s;e which is healthful both to mind and body. This in particular is the ca&s;e of too great indulgence in eating or drinking: &s;uch indulgence creates an habitual appetite, which demanding more than na|ture requires, loads the &s;tomach, depre&s;&s;es the &s;pi|rits, and brings on a habit of li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and inacti|vity,

Let them be&s;tow their riches in making others happy: &s;uch benevolence will double their own happine&s;s, fir&s;t, in the direct act of doing good; and next, in reflecting upon the good they have done, the mo&s;t delicate of all fea&s;ts.</P>

<P>The indulging in down-beds, &s;oft pillows, and ea&s;y &s;eats, is a &s;pecies of luxury, becau&s;e it tends to enervate the body, and to render, it unfit for fatigue. Some London ladies employ an operator for pairing their nails. Two young women of high quality, who were &s;i&s;ters, employed a &s;ervant with &s;oft hands to rai&s;e them gently out of bed in a morning. Nothing le&s;s than all-powerful vanity can make &s;uch per&s;ons &s;ubmit to the fatigues of a toilet: how can they ever think of &s;ubmitting to the horrid pangs of child-bearing? In the hot cli|mates of A&s;ia, people of rank are rubbed and chaf|fed twice a-day; which, be&s;ide being plea&s;ant, is nece&s;&s;ary for health, by moving the blood, in a hot country, where &s;loth and indolence prevail. The Greeks and Romans were curried, bathed, and oiled, daily; though they had not the &s;ame ex|cu&s;e for that practice: it was luxury in them, though not in the A&s;iatics.</P>

With re&s;pect to exerci&s;e, the various machines that have been invented for executing every &s;ort of work, render bodily &s;trength of le&s;s importance than formerly. This change is favourable to men|tal operations, without hurting bodily health. The travelling on hor&s;eback, though a le&s;s vigorous ex|ertion of &s;trength than walking, is not luxury, be|cau&s;e it is a healthful exerci&s;e. I dare not &s;ay &s;o much for wheel-carriages: a &s;pring-coach, rolling along a &s;mooth road, gives no exerci&s;e; or &s;o little, as to be preventive of no di&s;ea&s;e: it tends to ener|vate the body, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure al&s;o the mind. The increa&s;e of wheel-carriages within a century is a pregnant proof of the growth of luxurious in|dolence. During the reign of James I. the Engli&s;h judges rode to We&s;tmin&s;ter on hor&s;eback, and probably did &s;o for many years after his death. Charles I. i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, prohibiting hack|ney-coaches to be u&s;ed in London, except by tho&s;e who travel at lea&s;t three miles out of town. At the re&s;toration, Charles II. made his public entry into London on hor&s;eback, between his two bro|thers, Dukes of York and Glouce&s;ter. We have Ru&s;hworth for our voucher, that in London, not above a hundred years ago, there were but twenty hackney-coaches; which at the &s;ame time did not ply on the &s;treets, but were kept at home till called for. He adds, that the King and Council publi&s;h|ed a proclamation again&s;t them, becau&s;e they rai&s;ed the price of provender upon the King, nobility, and gentry. At pre&s;ent, one thou&s;and hackney-coaches ply on the &s;treets of London, be&s;ide a great number of &s;tage-coaches for travelling from Lon|don to all parts of the kingdom. The fir&s;t coach with gla&s;&s;es in France was brought from Bru&s;&s;els to Paris, anno 1650, by the Prince of Cond&eacute;. Sedan|chairs were not known in England before the year 1634.

&s;pirit of the Engli&s;h nobility and gentry to a languid &s;tate: the former, by overloading the bo|dy, has infected them with di&s;piriting ailments; the latter, by fo&s;tering ea&s;e and indolence, have bani&s;hed labour, the only antidote to &s;uch ailments. Too great indulgence in the fine arts con&s;umes part of that time which ought to be employed on the important duties of life: but the fine arts, even when too much indulged, produce one good effect, which is, to &s;often and humanize our manners: nor do they harm the body, if they relax not that degree of exerci&s;e which is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting it in health and vigour.</P>
<P>The enervating effects of luxury upon the body are, above all, remarkable in war. The officers of Alexander's army were &s;oon tainted with A&s;iatic manners. Mo&s;t of them, after bathing, had &s;er|vants for rubbing them, and, in&s;tead of plain oil, u&s;ed precious ointments. Leonatus, in particular, commi&s;&s;ioned from Egypt the powder he u&s;ed when he wre&s;tled, which loaded &s;everal camels. Alexan|der reproved them mildly: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I wonder that men who have undergone &s;uch fatigues in war, are not taught by experience, that labour produces &s;weeter and &s;ounder &s;leep than indolence. To be voluptuous, is an abject and &s;lavi&s;h &s;tate. How can a man take care of his hor&s;e, or keep his armour bright, who di&s;dains to em|ploy his own hands upon what is deare&s;t to him, his own body<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Plutarch.</NOTE>?"</Q></P>
<P>When we attend to the mind &s;ingly, manifold are the pernicious effects of luxury. Corporeal plea&s;ures, being all of them &s;elfi&s;h, tend, when much indulged, to make &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s the leading principle. Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, accordingly, relaxing
<PB N="136" REF="140">
every &s;ympathetic affection brings on a bea&s;tly &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s, which leaves nothing of man but the exter|nal figure. Luxury, be&s;ide, renders the mind &s;o effeminate, as to be &s;ubdued by every di&s;tre&s;s: the &s;lighte&s;t pain, whether of mind or body, is a real evil: and any higher degree becomes a &s;evere tor|ture. The French are far gone in that di&s;ea&s;e. Pictures of deep di&s;tre&s;s, which attract Engli&s;h &s;pectators, are, to the French, in&s;upportable: their aver&s;ion to pain overcomes the attractive power of &s;ympathy, and debars from the &s;lage every di&s;tre&s;s that makes a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the heart. The Briti&s;h are gradually &s;inking into the &s;ame weakne&s;s of mind: Venice Pre&s;erved collects not &s;uch numbers as it did originally; and would &s;carce be endured at pre&s;ent, were not our &s;ym|pathy blunted by familiarity: a new play upon a &s;imilar plan would not take. The gradual decay of manhood in Britain appears from their fune|ral rites. Formerly the decea&s;ed were attended to the grave by relations and friends of both &s;exes, and the day of their death was pre&s;erved in re|membrance with &s;olemn lamentations, as the day of their birth was, with exhilerating cups. In England a man was fir&s;t relieved from attending his decea&s;ed wi&s;e to the grave, and afterward from attending his decea&s;ed children; and now &s;uch ef|feminacy of mind prevails there, that in&s;tantly upon the lea&s;t groan, the decea&s;ed, abandoned by every relation, is delivered to an undertaker by profe&s;&s;ion, who is left at lei&s;ure to mimick the funeral rites. In Scotland, &s;uch refinement has not yet taken place: a man is indeed excu&s;ed from attend|ing his wife to the grave; but he performs that duty in per&s;on to every other relation, his children not excepted. I am told, that people of high fa&s;hion in England begin to leave the care of
<PB N="137" REF="141">
their &s;ick relations to hired nur&s;es, and think they do their duty in making &s;hort vi&s;its from time to time.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have con&s;idered Luxury with re|&s;pect to tho&s;e only who are infected with it; and did its poi&s;onous effects &s;pread no wider, the ca&s;e perhaps would be the le&s;s deplorable. But unhap|pily, where luxury prevails, the innocent &s;uffer with the guily. A man of oeconomy, whether a merchant or manufacturer, lays up a &s;tock for his children, and adds u&s;eful members to the &s;tate. A man, on the contrary, who lives above his for|tune, or his profits, accu&s;toms his children to luxury, and abandons them to poverty when he dies. Luxury, at the &s;ame time, is a great ene|my to population: it enhances the expence of liv|ing, and confines many to the bachelor-&s;tate. Luxu|ry of the table, in particular, is remarkable for that effect: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"L'homme riche met toute &s;a gloire &agrave; con&s;ommer, toute &s;a grandeur &agrave; perdre en un jour &agrave; &s;a table plus de biens qu'il n'en faudroit pour faire &s;ub&s;i&s;ter plu&s;ieurs familles.

To con&s;ider luxury in a political view, no re|finement of dre&s;s, of the table, of equipage, of habitation, is luxury in tho&s;e who can afford the expence; and the public gains by the encourage|ment that is given to arts, manufactures, and com|merce. But a mode of living above a man's an|nual income, weakens the &s;tate, by reducing to poverty, not only the &s;quanderers them&s;elves, but many innocent and indu&s;trious per&s;ons connected with them. Luxury is above all pernicious in a commercial &s;tate. A per&s;on of moderation is &s;atis|fied with &s;mall profits: not &s;o the luxurious, who de&s;pi&s;e every branch of trade but what returns great profits: other branches are ingro&s;&s;ed by foreigners, who are more frugal. The merchants of Am&s;terdam, and even of London, within a century, lived with more oeconomy than their clerks do at pre&s;ent. Their country hou&s;es and gardens make not the greate&s;t articles of their ex|pence.

Every cro&s;s accident makes him totter; and in labouring circum&s;tances he is tempted to venture all, in hopes of re-e&s;tabli&s;hment.

<P>IN treating of this &s;ubject, no opportunity has been omitted of &s;ugge&s;ting an important doctrine, That patrioti&s;m is the corner-&s;tone of civil &s;ociety; that no nation ever became great and powerful without it; and, when extingui&s;hed, that the mo&s;t powerful nation is in the high-way to contempt and di&s;&s;olution.

<HEAD>Appetite for SOCIETY.&mdash;Origin of NATIONAL SOCIETIES.</HEAD>
<P>THAT there is in man an appetite for &s;ociety, never was called in que&s;tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This appetite is not denied by Vitruvius; but it &s;eems to have been overlooked in the account he gives (book 2. ch. 1.) of the commencement of &s;ociety, which is as follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In ancient times, men, like wild bea&s;ts, lived in caves and woods, feeding on wild food. In a certain place it happened, that the trees, put in motion by tempe&s;tuous winds, and rub|bing their branches one again&s;t another, took fire. Tho&s;e in the neighbourhood fled for fear: but as the flames abated, they approached; and finding the heat comfortable, they threw wood into the fire, and pre&s;erved it from being extingui&s;hed. They then invited others to take benefit of the fire. Men, thus a&s;&s;embled, endeavoured to expre&s;s their thoughts by articulate &s;ounds; and by daily practice, certain &s;ounds, &s;ignifying things in frequent u&s;e, came to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. From that ca&s;ual event, language aro&s;e. And thus, fire having attracted many to one place, they &s;oon di&s;covered that they were by nature &s;uperior to other animals, differing from them not only in an erect po&s;ture, which gave them oppor|tunity to behold the beauties of the heavens as well as of the earth; but al&s;o in their hands and fingers, fitted for executing whatever they could invent. They therefore began to cover their habitations with the boughs of trees; &s;ome dug caves in the moun|tains; and, in imitation of a &s;wallow's ne&s;t, &s;ome &s;heltered them&s;elves with &s;prigs and loam. Thus, by ob&s;erving each other's work, and turning their thoughts to invention, they by degrees improved their habitations, and became daily more and more &s;kilful."</Q> Has not the celebrated Rou&s;&s;eau been guilty of the &s;ame over&s;ight in his E&s;&s;ay on the Inequa|lity of Men? The&s;e authors &s;ugge&s;t to me the butcher, who made diligent &s;earch for his knife, which he held between his teeth.</NOTE>. But to what end the appetite &s;erves, whether it be in any man|ner
<PB N="142" REF="146">
limitted, and how far men are naturally fitted for being u&s;eful members of civil &s;ociety, and for being happy in it, are que&s;tions that open exten|&s;ive views into human nature, and yet have been little attended to by writers. I grieve at the ne|glect, becau&s;e the pre&s;ent enquiry requires an an|&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions, however ab&s;tru&s;e.</P>
<P>As many animals, be&s;ide man, are &s;ocial, it ap|peared to me probable, that the &s;ocial laws by which &s;uch animals are governed, might open views into the &s;ocial nature of man. But here I met with a &s;econd di&s;appointment: for after peru&s;ing books without end, I found very little &s;atisfaction; though the laws of animal &s;ociety make the mo&s;t in&s;truc|tive and mo&s;t entertaining part of natural hi&s;tory. A few dry facts, collected occa&s;ionally, enabled me to form the embryo of a plan, which I here pre|&s;ent to the reader: if his curio&s;ity be excited, 'tis well; for I am far from expecting that it will be gratified.</P>
<P>Animals of prey have no appetite for &s;ociety, if the momentary act of copulation be not excepted. Wolves make not an exception, even where, in&s;ti|gated by hunger, they join in attacking a village: as fear prevents them &s;ingly from an attempt &s;o ha|zardous, their ca&s;ual union is prompted by appe|tite for food, not by appetite for &s;ociety. So little of the &s;ocial is there in wolves, that if one happens to be wounded, he is put to death, and devoured by tho&s;e of his own kind. Vultures have the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition. Their ordinary food is a dead carca&s;e;
<PB N="143" REF="147">
and they never venture but in a body to attack any living creature that appears formidable. Upon &s;o|ciety happine&s;s &s;o much depends, that we do not willingly admit a lion, a tyger, a bear, or a wolf, to have any appetite for &s;ociety. And in with-hold|ing it from &s;uch animals, the goodne&s;s of Provi|dence to its favourite man, is con&s;picuous: their &s;trength, agility, and voracity, make them &s;ingly not a little formidable: I &s;hould tremble for the hu|man race, were they di&s;po&s;ed to make war in com|pany<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The care of Providence in protecting the human race from animals of prey, is equally vi&s;ible in other particulars. I can di&s;cover no facts to make me be|lieve, that a lion or a tyger is afraid of a man; but whatever &s;ecret means are employed by Providence, to keep &s;uch fierce and voracious animals at a di&s;tance, certain it is, that they &s;hun the habitations of men. At pre&s;ent there is not a wild lion in Europe. Even in Homer's time there were none in Peloponne&s;us, tho' they were frequent in Thrace, Macedon, and The&s;&s;aly, down to the time of Ari&s;totle: whence it is probable, that the&s;e countries were not at that time well peopled. When men and cattle are together, a lion always at|tacks a bea&s;t, and never a man. M. Buffon ob&s;erves, that the bear, tho' far from being cowardly, never is at ea&s;e but in wild and de&s;ert places. The great condor of Peru, a bird of prey of an immen&s;e &s;ize, bold, and rapacious, is never &s;een but in de&s;erts and high moun|tains. Every river in the coa&s;t of Guinea abounds with crocodiles, which lie ba&s;king in the &s;un during the heat of the day. If they perceive a man approaching, they plunge into the river, though they &s;eldom fly from any other animal. A fox, on the contrary, a pole-cat, a kite, though afraid of man, draw near to inhabited places where they find prey in plenty. Such animals do little mi&s;chief; and the little they do, pro|motes care and vigilance. But if men, like &s;heep, were the natural prey of a lion or a tyger, their ut|mo&s;t vigour and &s;agacity would &s;carce be &s;ufficient for &s;elf-defence. Perpetual war would be their fate, with|out having a &s;ingle moment for any other occupation; and they could never have emerged out of brutal bar|barity. It is po&s;&s;ible that a few cattle might be pro|tected by armed men, continually on the watch; but to defend flocks and herds covering a hundred hills, would be impracticable. Agriculture could never have exi&s;ted in any &s;hape.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="148">
Such harmle&s;s animals as cannot defend them|&s;elves &s;ingly, are provided with an appetite for &s;o|ciety, that they may defend them&s;elves in a body. Sheep are remarkable in that re&s;pect, when left to nature: a ram &s;eldom attacks; but the rams of a flock exert great vigour in defending their females and their young<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Buffon has be&s;towed le&s;s pains than becomes an author of his character, upon the nature and in&s;tincts of animals: he indeed &s;carce once &s;tumbles upon truth in his natural hi&s;tory of the &s;heep. He holds it to be &s;tupid, and incapable to defend it&s;elf again&s;t any bea&s;t of prey; maintaining, that the race could not have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted but under the care and protection of men. Has that author forgot, that &s;heep had no enemy more formidable than men, in their original hunter-&s;tate? Far from being neglected by nature, there are few ani|mals better provided for defence. They have a &s;ort of military in&s;tinct, forming a line of battle, like &s;ol|diers, when threatened with an attack. The rams, who, in a natural &s;tate, make half of the flock, join together; and no lion or tyger is able to re&s;i&s;t their united impetuo&s;ity.</NOTE>. The whole &s;ociety of rooks join in attacking a kite when it hovers about them. A family of wild &s;wine never &s;eparate till the young be &s;ufficiently &s;trong to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the wolf; and when the wolf threatens, they all join in a body. The pecary is a &s;ort of wild hog in the i&s;thmus of Darien: if one of them be attacked, the re&s;t run to a&s;&s;i&s;t it. There being a natural anti|pathy
<PB N="145" REF="149">
between that animal and the American tyger, it is not uncommon to find a tyger &s;lain with a num|ber of dead pecaries round him.</P>
<P>The &s;ocial appetite is to &s;ome animals u&s;eful, not only for de&s;ence, but for procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Society among beavers is a notable in&s;tance of both. As water is the only refuge of that in|nocent &s;pecies again&s;t an enemy, they in&s;tinctively make their &s;ettlement on the brink of a lake or of a running &s;tream. In the latter ca&s;e, they keep up the water to a proper height by a dam-dike, con|&s;tructed with &s;o much art as to with&s;tand the great|e&s;t &s;loods: in the former, they &s;ave them&s;elves the labour of a dam-dike, becau&s;e a lake generally keeps at the &s;ame height. Having thus provided for de|fence, their next care is to provide food and habi|tation. The whole &s;ociety join in erecting the dam-dike; and they al&s;o join in erecting hou&s;es. Each hou&s;e has two apartments: in the upper there is &s;pace for lodging from &s;ix to ten beavers: the un|der holds their provi&s;ions, which are trees cut down by united labour, and divided into &s;mall portable parts<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the works of the beaver de&s;cribed mo&s;t ac|curately by M. Buffon, vol 8.</NOTE>. Bees are a &s;imilar in&s;tance. Ari&s;to|tle<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of animals, b. 9. c. 40.</NOTE> &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that bees are the only animals which labour in common, have a hou&s;e in common, eat in common, and have their offspring in com|mon."</Q> A &s;ingle bee would be &s;till le&s;s able than a &s;ingle beaver to build a hou&s;e for it&s;elf and for its winter-food. The Alpine rat or marmount has no occa&s;ion to &s;tore up food for winter, becau&s;e it lies benumbed without motion all the cold months. But the&s;e animals live in tribes; and each tribe digs a habitation under ground with great art, &s;uffi|ciently capacious for lodging the whole tribe; co|vering
<PB N="146" REF="150">
the ground with withered gra&s;s, which &s;ome cut, and others carry. The wild dogs of Congo and Angola hunt in packs, waging perpetual war again&s;t other wild bea&s;ts. They bring to the place of rendezvous whatever is caught in hunting; and each receives its &s;hare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However fierce with re&s;pect to other animals, yet &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive are the&s;e dogs to men, as to &s;uffer their prey to be taken from them without re&s;i&s;tance. Euro|peans &s;alt for their &s;laves what they thus obtain.</NOTE>. The baboons are &s;ocial animals, and avail them&s;elves of that quality in procuring food; witne&s;s their addre&s;s in robbing an orchard, de&s;cribed by Kolben in his account of the Cape of Good Hope. Some go into the orchard, &s;ome place them&s;elves on the wall, the re&s;t form a line on the out&s;ide, and the fruit is thrown from hand to hand, till it reach the place of rendezvous. Extending the enquiry to all known animals, we find that the appetite for &s;ociety is with-held from no &s;pecies to which it is nece&s;&s;ary, whether for de|fence or for food. It appears to be di&s;tributed by weight and mea&s;ure, in order to accommodate the internal frame of animals to their external circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>On &s;ome animals an appetite for &s;ociety is be|&s;towed, though in appearance not nece&s;&s;ary either for defence or for food. With regard to &s;uch, the only final cau&s;e we can di&s;cover is the plea&s;ure of living in &s;ociety. That kind of &s;ociety is found among hor&s;es. Outhier, one of the French aca|demicians employed to mea&s;ure a degree of the me|ridian toward the north pole, reports, that at Tor|neo all bulky goods are carried in boats during &s;um|mer; but in winter, when the rivers are frozen, and the ground covered with &s;now, that they u&s;e &s;ledges drawn by hor&s;es; that when the &s;now melts, and the rivers are open, the hor&s;es, &s;et loo&s;e, ren|dezvous
<PB N="147" REF="151">
at a certain part of the fore&s;t, where they &s;eparate into troops, and occupy different pa&s;ture|fields; that when the&s;e fields become bare, they occupy new ground in the &s;ame order as at fir&s;t; that they return home in troops when the bad wea|ther begins; and that every hor&s;e knows its own &s;tall. No creature &s;tands le&s;s in need of &s;ociety than a hare, whether for food or for defence. Of food, it has plenty under its feet; and for defence, it is provided both with cunning and &s;wi&s;tne&s;s. No|thing however is more common in a moon-light night, than to &s;ee hares &s;porting together in the mo&s;t &s;ocial manner. But &s;ociety for plea&s;ure only, is an imperfect kind of &s;ociety; and far from being &s;o intimate, as where it is provided by nature for defence, or for procuring food<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pigeons mu&s;t be excepted, if their &s;ociety be not nece&s;&s;ary either for food or habitation, of which I am uncertain. Society among that &s;pecies is extremely in|timate; and it is ob&s;ervable, that the place they inha|bit contributes to the intimacy. A crazy dove-cot moved the proprietor to transfer the inhabitants to a new hou&s;e built for them; and to accu&s;tom them to it, they were kept a fortnight within doors, with plenty of food. When they obtained liberty, they flew di|rectly to their old hou&s;e; and &s;eeing it laid flat, walk|ed round and round, lamenting. They then took wing and di&s;appeared, without once ca&s;ting an eye on their new habitation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the extent of the appetite, no &s;ocial animal, as far as can be di&s;covered, has an ap|petite for a&s;&s;ociating with the whole &s;pecies. Eve|ry &s;pecies is divided into many &s;mall tribes; and the&s;e tribes have no appetite for a&s;&s;ociating with each other: on the contrary, a &s;tray &s;heep is thru&s;t out of the flock, and a &s;tray bee mu&s;t in&s;tantly re|tire, or be &s;tung to death. Every work of Provi|dence contributes to &s;ome good end: a &s;mall tribe
<PB N="148" REF="152">
is &s;ufficient for mutual defence; and a very large tribe would find difficulty in procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>How far brute animals are by nature fitted for being u&s;eful members of civil &s;ociety, and for being happy in it, is a que&s;tion that no writer hath &s;o much as &s;tumbled on. And yet, as that branch of natural hi&s;tory is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to my plan, I mu&s;t proceed; tho' I have nothing to lay before the reader but a few &s;cattered ob&s;ervations, which oc|curred when I had no view of turning them to ac|count. I begin with the in&s;tinctive conduct of animals, in providing again&s;t danger. When a flock of &s;heep, in the &s;tate of nature, goes to re&s;t, centinels are appointed; who, on appearance of an enemy, &s;tamp with the foot, and make a hi&s;&s;ing &s;ound; upon which all take the alarm: if no enemy appear, they watch their time, return to the &s;lock, and &s;end out others in their &s;tead. And in flocks that have an exten&s;ive range in hilly countries, the &s;ame di&s;cipline obtains, even after dome&s;tication. Tho' monkies &s;leep upon trees, yet a centinel is al|ways appointed, who mu&s;t not &s;leep, under pain of being torn to pieces. They pre&s;erve the &s;ame di&s;|cipline when they rob an orchard: a centinel on a high tree is watchful to announce the very fir&s;t ap|pearance of an enemy. M. Buffon, talking of a &s;ort of monkey, which he terms Malbrouck, &s;ays, that they are fond of fruit, and of &s;ugar-canes; and that while they are loading them&s;elves, one is placed centinel on a tree, who, upon the approach of a man, cries, Houp! Houp! Houp! loudly and di&s;|tinctly. That moment they throw away the &s;ugar-canes that they hold in their left hand, and run off upon three feet. When the marmounts are at work in the field, one is appointed to watch on a high rock; which adverti&s;es them, by a loud whi&s;tle, when it &s;ees a man, an eagle, or a dog. Among beavers, notice is given of the approach of an ene|my,
<PB N="149" REF="153">
by la&s;hing the water with the tail, which is heard in every habitation. Scale always &s;leep on the beach; and to prevent &s;urpri&s;e, centinels are placed round at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the main body. Wild elephants, which always travel in company, are le&s;s on their guard in places un|frequented: but when they invade cultivated fields, they march in order, the elde&s;t in the front, and the next in age clo&s;ing the rear. The weak are placed in the centre, and the females carry their young on their trunk. They attack in a body; and upon a repul&s;e, retire in a body. Tame elephants retain &s;o much of their original nature, that if one, upon being wounded, turns its back, the re&s;t in&s;tant|ly follow. Next in order is the government of a tribe, and the conduct of its members to each other. It is not unlikely, that &s;ociety among &s;ome animals, and their mutual affection, may be &s;o entire as to prevent all di&s;cord among them; which indeed &s;eems to be the ca&s;e of beavers. Such a &s;ociety, if there be &s;uch, requires no government, nor any laws. A flock of &s;heep occupies the &s;ame &s;pot every night, and each hath its own re&s;ting-place. The &s;ame is ob&s;ervable in horned cattle when folded. And as we find not, that any one ever attempts to di&s;|lodge another, it is probable that &s;uch re&s;traint makes a branch of their nature. But &s;ociety among brute animals is not always &s;o perfect. Perver&s;e inclinations, tending to di&s;turb &s;ociety, are vi&s;ible among &s;ome brute animals, as well as among ra|tional men. It is not uncommon for a rook to pil|fer &s;ticks from another's ne&s;t; and the pilferer's ne&s;t is demoli&s;hed by the lex talionis. Perver&s;e in|clinations require government, and government requires laws. As in the ca&s;e now mentioned, the whole &s;ociety join in inflicting the puni&s;hment, go|vernment among rooks appears to be republican. Apes, on the contrary, are under monarchical go|vernment.
<PB N="150" REF="154">
Apes in Siam go in troops, each under a leader, who pre&s;erves &s;trict di&s;cipline. A female carnally inclined, retired from the troop, and was followed by a male. The male e&s;caped from the leader, who pur&s;ued them; but the female was brought back, and in pre&s;ence of the whole troop received fifty blows on the cheek, as a cha&s;ti&s;ement for its incontinence<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Count Forbin.</NOTE>. But probably there are not many in&s;tances, among brutes, of government approaching &s;o near to that of men. Government among horned cattle appears to have no other end but to pre&s;erve order. Their government is mo|narchical; and the election is founded upon per&s;onal valour, the mo&s;t &s;olid of all qualifications in &s;uch a &s;ociety. The bull, who a&s;pires to be lord of the herd, mu&s;t fight his way to preferment; and after all his rivals are beat off the field, the herd tamely &s;ubmit. At the &s;ame time he is not &s;ecured in the throne for life; but mu&s;t again enter the li&s;ts with any bull that ventures to challenge him. The &s;ame &s;pirit is ob&s;ervable among oxen, though in a lower degree. The ma&s;ter-ox leads the re&s;t into the &s;ta|ble, or into the fold, and becomes unruly if he be not let fir&s;t out: nay, he mu&s;t be fir&s;t yoked in the plough or waggon. Sheep are not employed in work, but in every other re&s;pect the &s;ame oeconomy obtains among them. Where the rams happen to be few, in proportion to the other &s;heep, they &s;ometimes divide the flock among them, in&s;tead of fighting for precedence. Five or &s;ix &s;core of &s;heep were purcha&s;ed a few years ago by the author of this work. The rams, who were only two, divided the flock between them. The two parcels could not avoid pa&s;turing in common, becau&s;e they were &s;hut up in one inclo&s;ure: but they had different &s;pots for re&s;t during night; nor was it known, that a &s;heep
<PB N="151" REF="155">
ever de&s;erted its party, or even changed its re&s;ting|place. In the two &s;pecies la&s;t mentioned, I find not that there is any notion of puni&s;hment; nor does it appear to be nece&s;&s;ary: the leader pretends to no|thing but precedence, which is never di&s;puted. I blu&s;h to pre&s;ent the&s;e imper&s;ect hints, the fruit of ca&s;ual ob&s;ervation, not of intentional enquiry: but I am glad to blow the trumpet, in order to rai&s;e curio&s;ity in others: if the &s;ubject be pro&s;ecuted by men of ta&s;te and enquiry, many final cau&s;es, I am per&s;uaded, will be di&s;covered, tending more and more to di&s;play the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of Provi|dence. But what I have chiefly in view at pre&s;ent is, to ob&s;erve, that government among brute ani|mals, however &s;imple, appears to be perfect in its kind; and adapted with great propriety to their na|ture. Factions in the &s;tate are unknown: no en|mity between individuals, no treachery, no deceit, nor any other of tho&s;e vices that infe&s;t the human race. In a word, they appear to be perfectly well fitted for that kind of &s;ociety to which they are prompted by their nature, and for being happy in it.</P>
<P>Storing up the foregoing ob&s;ervations till there be occa&s;ion for them, we proceed to the &s;ocial nature of man. That men are endued with an appetite for &s;ociety, will be vouched by the concurring te&s;ti|mony of all men, each vouching for him&s;elf. There is accordingly no in&s;tance of people living in a &s;o|litary &s;tate, where the appetite is not ob&s;tructed by &s;ome potent ob&s;tacle. The inhabitants of that part of New Holland which Dampier &s;aw, live in &s;ocie|ty, though le&s;s advanced above brutes than any other known &s;avages; and &s;o intimate is their &s;o|ciety, that they gather their food, and eat, in com|mon. The inhabitants of the Canary i&s;lands lived in the &s;ame manner, when fir&s;t &s;een by Europeans, which was in the fourteenth century; and the &s;a|vages
<PB N="152" REF="156">
mentioned by Condamine, drawn by a Je&s;uit from the woods to &s;ettle on the banks of the Oroo|noko, mu&s;t originally have been united in &s;ome kind of &s;ociety, as they had a common language. In a word, that man hath an appetite for food, is not more certain than that he hath an appetite for &s;ociety. And here I have occa&s;ion to ap|ply one of the ob&s;ervations made above. Ab&s;tract|ing altogether from the plea&s;ure we have in &s;ociety, &s;imilar to what we have in eating; evident it is, that to no animal is &s;ociety more nece&s;&s;ary than to man, whether for food or for defence. In &s;ociety, he is chief of the terre&s;trial creation; in a &s;olitary &s;tate, the mo&s;t helple&s;s and forlorn. Thus the fir&s;t que&s;tion &s;ugge&s;ted above, viz. To what end was a &s;ocial appetite be&s;towed on man, has received an an&s;wer, which I flatter my&s;elf will give &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion is, Whether the appetite be limited, as among other animals, to a &s;ociety of moderate extent; or whether it prompts an a&s;&s;ocia|ation with the whole &s;pecies. That the appetite is limited, will be evident from hi&s;tory. Men, as far back as they can be traced, have been divided in|to &s;mall tribes or &s;ocieties. Mo&s;t of the&s;e, it is true, have, in latter times, been united into large &s;tates: &s;uch revolutions however have been brought about, not by an appetite for a more exten&s;ive &s;ociety, but by conque&s;t, or by the junction of &s;mall tribes for defence again&s;t the more power|ful. A &s;ociety may indeed be too &s;mall for complete gratification of the appetite; and the appetite thus cramped welcomes every per&s;on into the &s;ociety till it have &s;ufficient &s;cope: the Romans, a diminutive tribe originally, were fond to a&s;&s;ociate even with their enemies after a victory. But, on the other hand, a &s;ociety may be too large for complete gra|tification. An exten&s;ive empire is an object too bulky: national affection is too much diffu&s;ed; and
<PB N="153" REF="157">
the mind is not at ea&s;e till it finds a more contracted &s;ociety, corre&s;ponding to the moderation of its ap|petite. Hence the numerous orders, a&s;&s;ociations, fraternities, and divi&s;ions, that &s;pring up in every great &s;tate. The ever-during Blues and Greens in the Roman empire, and Guelphs and Gibelines in Italy, could not have long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted after the cau&s;e of their enmity was at an end, but for a tendency in the members of a great &s;tate to contract their &s;o|cial connections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The never-cea&s;ing factions in Britain proceed, not from a &s;ociety too much extended, but from love of power and of wealth, to re&s;train which there is no &s;uf|ficient authority in a free government.</NOTE>. Initiations among the ancients were probably owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e; as al&s;o a&s;|&s;ociations of arti&s;ans among the moderns, pretend|ing my&s;tery and &s;ecrecy, and excluding all &s;trangers. Of &s;uch a&s;&s;ociations or brotherhoods, the free ma|&s;ons excepted, there is &s;carce now a ve&s;tige remain|ing.</P>
<P>We find now, after an accurate &s;crutiny, that the &s;ocial appetite in man comprehends not the whole &s;pecies, but a part only; and commonly a &s;mall part, preci&s;ely as in other animals. Here an|other final cau&s;e &s;tarts up, no le&s;s remarkable than that explained above. An appetite to a&s;&s;ociate with the whole &s;pecies would form &s;tates &s;o unwieldy by numbers, as to be incapable of any government. Our appetite is wi&s;ely confined within &s;uch limits as to form &s;tates of moderate extent, which of all are the be&s;t fitted for good government; and we &s;hall &s;ee afterward that they are al&s;o the be&s;t fitted for improving the human powers, and for envigorating every manly virtue. Hence an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on, That a great empire is ill &s;uited to human nature, and that a great conqueror is in more re&s;pects than one an enemy to mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="158">
The limiting our &s;ocial appetite within moderate bounds &s;ugge&s;ts another final cau&s;e. An appetite to a&s;&s;ociate with the whole &s;pecies would collect into one &s;ociety all who are not &s;eparated from each other by wide &s;eas and inacce&s;&s;ible mountains; and con&s;equently would di&s;tribute mankind into a very few &s;ocieties, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch multitudes as to reduce national affection to a mere &s;hadow. Nature hath wi&s;ely limited the appetite in proportion to our mental capacity. Our relations, our friends, and our other connections, open an exten&s;ive field for the exerci&s;e of affection: nay, our country in ge|neral, if not too exten&s;ive, would alone be &s;ufficient to engro&s;s our whole affection. But that beautiful &s;peculation falls more properly under the principles of morality; and there it &s;hall not be overlooked.</P>
<P>What comes next in order, is to examine how we &s;tand affected to tho&s;e who are not of our tribe or &s;ociety. I pave the way to this examination, by taking up man naked at his entrance into life. An infant at fir&s;t has no feeling but bodily pain; and it is familiarized with its nur&s;e, its parents, and per|haps with others, before it is &s;u&s;ceptible of any pa&s;|&s;ion. All weak animals are endowed with a princi|ple of fear, which prompts them to &s;hun danger; and fear, the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion di&s;covered in an infant, is rai&s;ed by every new face: the infant &s;hrinks and hides it&s;elf in the bo&s;om of its nur&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this re&s;pect the human race differs widely from that of dogs: a puppy, the fir&s;t time it &s;ees a man, runs to him, licks his hand, and plays about his feet.</NOTE><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 1. p. 441. edit. 5.</NOTE>. Thus every &s;tranger is an object of fear to an infant; and con&s;equently of aver&s;ion, which is generated by fear. Fear le&s;&s;ens gradually as our circle of ac|quaintance enlarges, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e who rely on bodily &s;trength. Nothing tends more effectually to di&s;&s;ipate fear, than con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ecurity in the
<PB N="155" REF="159">
&s;ocial &s;tate: in &s;olitude, no animal is more timid than man; in &s;ociety, none more bold. But re|mark, that aver&s;ion may &s;ub&s;i&s;t after fear is gone: it is propagated from parents to their children through an endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and is infectious like a di&s;ea&s;e. Thus enmity is kept up between tribes, without any particular cau&s;e. A neighbouring tribe, con&s;tantly in our &s;ight, and capable to hurt us, is the object of our &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion: it le&s;&s;ens in proportion to di&s;tance; and terminates in ab&s;o|lute indifference with re&s;pect to very di&s;tant tribes. Upon the whole, it appears, that the nature of man with re&s;pect to tho&s;e of his own kind is re&s;olv|able into the following particulars. Fir&s;t, Affection for our private connections, and for our country in general. Second, Aver&s;ion to neighbours who are &s;trangers to us, and to neighbouring tribes in gene|ral. Third, Indifference with re&s;pect to all others.</P>
<P>As I neither hope nor wi&s;h, that the nature of man, as above delineated, be taken upon my au|thority, I propo&s;e to verify it by clear and &s;ub&s;tan|tial facts. But to avoid the multiplying in&s;tances unnece&s;&s;arily, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to &s;uch as con|cern the aver&s;ion that neighbouring tribes have to each other; taking it for granted, that private af|fection, and love to our country, are what no per|&s;on doubts of. I begin with examples of rude na|tions, where nature is left to it&s;elf, without culture. The inhabitants of Greenland, good-natured and inoffen&s;ive, have not even words for expre&s;&s;ing an|ger or envy: &s;tealing among them&s;elves is abhor|red; and a young woman guilty of that crime, has no chance for a hu&s;band. At the &s;ame time, they are faithle&s;s and cruel to tho&s;e who come among them: they con&s;ider the re&s;t of mankind as a diffe|rent race, with whom they reject all &s;ociety. The morality of the inhabitants of New Zealand is not more refined. Writers differ about the inhabitants of the Marian or Ladrone i&s;lands: Magellan, and
<PB N="156" REF="160">
other voyagers, &s;ay, that they are addicted to thiev|ing: and their te&s;timony occa&s;ioned the&s;e i&s;lands to be called Ladrones. Pere le Gobien, on the con|trary, &s;ays, that, far from being addicted to thiev|ing, they leave every thing open, having no di&s;tru&s;t one of another. The&s;e accounts differ in appear|ance, not in reality. Magellan was a &s;tranger; and he talks of &s;tealing from him and from his compa|nions. Father Gobien lived long among them, and talks of their fidelity to each other. Plan Car|pin, who vi&s;ited Tartary in the year 1246, ob&s;erves of the Tartars, that, though full of veracity to their neighbours, they thought them&s;elves not bound to &s;peak truth to &s;trangers. The Greeks an|ciently were held to be pirates: but not properly; for they committed depredations upon &s;trangers on|ly. Cae&s;ar, &s;peaking of the Germans<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6. c. 23. de Bello Gallico.</NOTE>, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Latrocinia nullam habent infamiam quae extra fines cuju&s;que civitatis fiunt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They hold it not infamous to rob without the bounds of their canton."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> This was pre|ci&s;ely the ca&s;e of our highlanders, till they were brought under due &s;ubjection after the rebel|lion 1745. Bougainville ob&s;erves, that the inhabi|tants of Otaheite, named by the Engli&s;h, King-George's i&s;land, made no difficulty of &s;tealing from his people; and yet never &s;teal among them&s;elves, having neither locks nor bars in their hou&s;es. The people of Benin in Negroland are good-natured, gentle, and civilized; and &s;o generous, that if they receive a pre&s;ent, they are not at ea&s;e till they re|turn it double. They have unbounded confidence in their own people; but are jealous of &s;trangers, though they politely hide their jealou&s;y. Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants think it a greater &s;in to eat meat in Lent, than to murder one of another country. Among
<PB N="157" REF="161">
the Koriacs, bordering on Kam&s;katka, murder within the tribe is &s;everely puni&s;hed; but to murder a &s;tranger is not minded. While Rome continued a &s;mall &s;tate, neighbour and enemy were expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame word<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;tis.</NOTE>. In England of old, a fo|reigner was not admitted to be a witne&s;s. Hence it is that, in ancient hi&s;tory, we read of wars with|out intermi&s;&s;ion among &s;mall &s;tates in clo&s;e neigh|bourhood. It was &s;o in Greece; it was &s;o in Italy during the infancy of the Roman republic; it was &s;o in Gaul, when Cae&s;ar commenced ho&s;tilities again&s;t that country<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6. c. 15. de Bello Gallico.</NOTE>; and it was &s;o all the world over. Many i&s;lands in the South &s;ea, and in other remote parts, have been di&s;covered by Europeans; who commonly found the natives with arms in their hands, re&s;olute to prevent the &s;trangers from land|ing. Orellana, lieutenant to Gonzales Pi&s;arro, was the fir&s;t European who &s;ailed down the river Ama|zon to the &s;ea. In his pa&s;&s;age, he was continually a&s;&s;aulted with arrows from the banks of the river; and &s;ome even ventured to attack him in their ca|noes.</P>
<P>Nor does &s;uch aver&s;ion wear away even among poli&s;hed people. An ingenious writer<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Baretti.</NOTE> remarks, that almo&s;t every nation hate their neighbours, with|out knowing why. I once heard a Frenchman &s;wear, &s;ays that writer, that he hated the Engli&s;h, parce qu'ils ver&s;ent du beurre fondu &s;ur leur veau roti<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e they pour melted butter upon their Roa&s;t veal."</Q></NOTE>. The populace of Portugal have to this day an uncommon aver&s;ion to &s;trangers: even tho&s;e of Li&s;bon, though a trading town frequented by many different nations, mu&s;t not be excepted. Travel|lers report, that the people of the duchy of Milan,
<PB N="158" REF="162">
remarkable for good-nature, are the only Italians who are not hated by their neighbours. The Pied|monte&s;e and Genoe&s;e have an aver&s;ion to each other, and agree only in their antipathy to the Tu&s;cans. The Tu&s;cans di&s;like the Venetians; and the Ro|mans abound not with good-will to the Tu&s;cans, Venetians, or Neapolitans. Very different is the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to di&s;tant nations: in&s;tead of being objects of aver&s;ion, their manners, cu&s;toms, and &s;ingularities, amu&s;e us greatly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire, (Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, ch. 40.) ob&s;erving, rightly, that jealou&s;y among petty princes is productive of more crimes than among great monarchs, gives a ve|ry un&s;atisfactory rea&s;on, viz. That having little force, they mu&s;t employ fraud, poi&s;on, and other &s;ecret crimes; not adverting, that power may be equally di&s;tributed among &s;mall princes as well as among great men. It is antipathy that in&s;tigates &s;uch crimes, which is al|ways the mo&s;t violent among the neare&s;t neighbours.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Infants differ from each other in aver&s;ion to &s;tran|gers; &s;ome being extremely &s;hy, others le&s;s &s;o; and the like difference is ob&s;ervable in whole tribes. The people of Milan cannot have any aver&s;ion to their neighbours, when they are &s;uch favourites of all around them. The inhabitants of &s;ome South|&s;ea i&s;lands, mentioned above<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Book 1. Sketch 1.</NOTE>, appear to have lit|tle or no aver&s;ion to &s;trangers. But that is a rare in&s;tance, and has &s;carce a parallel in any other part of the globe. It holds al&s;o true, that nations the mo&s;t remarkable for patrioti&s;m, are equally remark|able for aver&s;ion to &s;trangers. The Jews, the Greeks, the Romans, were equally remarkable for both. Patrioti&s;m, a vigorous principle among the Engli&s;h, makes them extremely aver&s;e to naturalize foreigners. The inhabitants of New Zealand, both men and women, appear to be of a mild and gen|tle di&s;po&s;ition; they treat one another with affecti|on:
<PB N="159" REF="163">
but are implacable to their enemies, and never give quarter. It is even cu&s;tomary among them to eat the fle&s;h of their enemies.</P>
<P>To a per&s;on of humanity, the &s;cene here exhi|bited is far from being agreeable. Man, it may be thought, is of all animals the mo&s;t barbarous; for even animals of prey are innoxious with re&s;pect to their own kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Denique caetera animantia in &s;uo genere probe degunt: congregari videmus, et &s;tare contra di&s;&s;imi|lia: leonum feritas inter &s;e non dimicat: &s;erpentum mor&s;us non petit &s;erpentes; ne maris quidem belluae ac pi&s;ces, ni&s;i in diver&s;a genera, &s;aeviunt.

Aver&s;ion to &s;trangers makes a branch of our nature: it exi&s;ts among individuals in private life; it flames high between neighbouring tribes; and is vi&s;ible even in infancy. Can &s;uch perver&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ition promote any good end? This que&s;tion, which pierces deep into human na|ture, is re&s;erved to clo&s;e the pre&s;ent &s;ketch.</P>
<P>From the foregoing deduction, univer&s;al bene|volence, inculcated by &s;everal writers as a moral duty, is di&s;covered to be erroneous. Our appetite for &s;ociety is limitted, and our duty mu&s;t be limit|ted in proportion. But of this more directly when the principles of morality are taken under con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P>We are taught by the great Newton, that attrac|tion and repul&s;ion in matter are, by alteration of circum&s;tances, converted one into the other. This holds al&s;o in affection and aver&s;ion, which may be
<PB N="160" REF="164">
termed, not improperly, mental attraction and re|pul&s;ion. Two nations, originally &s;trangers to each other, may, by commerce, or other favourable circum&s;tance, become &s;o well acquainted, as to change from aver&s;ion to affection. The oppo&s;ite manners of a capital and of a country-town afford a good illu&s;tration. In the latter, people, occupied with their dome&s;tic concerns, are in a manner &s;trangers to each other: a degree of aver&s;ion pre|vails, which gives birth to envy and detraction. In the former, a court, with public amu&s;ements, pro|mote general acquaintance: repul&s;ion yields to at|traction, and people become fond to a&s;&s;ociate with their equals. The union of two tribes into one, is another circum&s;tance that converts repul&s;ion into at|traction. Such conver&s;ion, however, is far from being in&s;tantaneous; witne&s;s the different &s;mall &s;tates of Spain, which were not united in affection for many years after they were united under one mo|narch; and this was al&s;o the ca&s;e of the two king|doms of England and Scotland. In &s;ome circum|&s;tances the conver&s;ion is in&s;tantaneous; as where a &s;tranger becomes an object of pity or of gratitude. Many low per&s;ons in Britain contributed chearfully for maintaining &s;ome French &s;eamen, made pri&s;on|ers at the commencement of the late war. It is no le&s;s in&s;tantaneous, when &s;trangers, relying on our humanity, tru&s;t them&s;elves in our hands. Among the ancients, it was ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers only that produced mutual affection and gratitude: Glaucus and Diomede were of different countries. Ho&s;pita|lity to &s;trangers is a pregnant &s;ymptom of improving manners.

<P>There are cau&s;es that for a time &s;u&s;pend enmity between neighbouring &s;tates. The &s;mall &s;tates of Greece, among whom war had no end, frequently &s;mothered their enmity to join again&s;t the formida|ble monarch of Per&s;ia. There are al&s;o cau&s;es that &s;u&s;pend for a time all animo&s;ity between factions in the &s;ame &s;tate. The endle&s;s factions in Britain about power and pre-eminence, not a little di&s;a|greeable during peace, are laid a&s;leep during a fo|reign war.</P>
<P>On the other hand, attraction is converted into repul&s;ion by various cau&s;es. One is, the &s;plitting a
<PB N="162" REF="166">
great monarchy into many &s;mall &s;tates; of which the A&s;&s;yrian, the Per&s;ian, the Roman, and the Sa|racen empires, are in&s;tances. The amor patriae, faint in an exten&s;ive monarchy, readily yields to aver&s;ion, operating between two neighbouring &s;tates, le&s;s exten&s;ive. This is ob&s;ervable between neighbouring colonies even of the &s;ame nation: the Engli&s;h colonies in North America, though they re|tain &s;ome affection for their mother-country, have contracted an aver&s;ion to each other. And happy for them is &s;uch aver&s;ion, if it prevent their uniting in order to acquire independency: wars without end would be the inevitable con&s;equence, as among &s;mall &s;tates in clo&s;e neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Hitherto the road has been &s;mooth, without ob|&s;truction. But we have not yet fini&s;hed our jour|ney; and the remaining que&s;tion, viz. How far are men fitted by their nature for being u&s;eful members of civil &s;ociety, and for being happy in it, will, I &s;u&s;pect, lead into a road neither &s;mooth nor free from ob&s;truction. The &s;ocial branch of human na|ture would be wofully imperfect, if man had an ap|petite for &s;ociety without being fitted for that &s;tate; the appetite, in&s;tead of tending to a good end, would be his bane. And yet, whether he be or be not fitted for &s;ociety, &s;eems doubtful. In examin|ing the conduct of man, he is to us a di&s;gu&s;tful ob|ject in his aver&s;ion to tho&s;e of a different tribe; and I violently &s;u&s;pect, that in his behaviour even to tho&s;e of his own tribe, he will &s;carce be found an agreeable object.

<P>Men are prone to &s;plit into parties for the very &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;es; and when a cau&s;e is wanting, par|ties are often formed upon words merely. Whig and Tory &s;ub&s;i&s;ted long in England, upon no better foundation. The Tories profe&s;&s;ed pa&s;&s;ive obedi|ence; but declared, that they would not be &s;laves. The Whigs profe&s;&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance; but declared it un|lawful to re&s;i&s;t unle&s;s to prevent the being made&s;laves. Had the&s;e parties been di&s;po&s;ed to unite, they &s;oon would have di&s;covered, that they differed in words only. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to many religious di&s;putes. One &s;ect maintains, that we are &s;aved by faith alone; another, that good works are nece&s;&s;ary. The difference lies merely in words. The fir&s;t acknowledges, that if a man commit &s;in,

he cannot have faith; and con&s;equently under faith are comprehended good works. The other ac|knowledges, that good works imply good intention, or, in other words, faith; and con&s;equently, un|der good works faith is comprehended<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See Knox's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of Scotland, p. 13.</NOTE>. The fol|lowing in&s;tance, &s;olemnly ludicrous, is of parties formed merely from an inclination to differ, without any cau&s;e real or verbal.

<P>What conclu&s;ion are we to draw from the fore|going facts, &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent in appearance with each other?

In order to a &s;o|lution, we find it nece&s;&s;ary to take a &s;econd view of the natural hi&s;tory of man.</P>
<P>In a na&s;cent &s;ociety, where men hunt and fi&s;h in common, where there is plenty of game, and where the &s;en&s;e of property is faint, mutual affec|tion prevails, becau&s;e there is no cau&s;e of di&s;cord; and di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions find &s;ufficient vent again&s;t neighbouring tribes. Such is the condition of the North-American &s;avages, who continue hunters and fi&s;hers to this day; and &s;uch is the condition of all brute animals that live in &s;ociety, as mentioned above. The i&s;land Otaheite is divided into many &s;mall cantons, having each a chief of its own. The&s;e cantons never make war on each other, tho' they are frequently at war with the inhabitants of neigh|bouring i&s;lands. The inhabitants of the new Philip|pine i&s;lands, if Father Gobien be credited, are bet|ter fitted for &s;ociety than any other known nation. Sweetne&s;s of temper, and love to do good, form their character. They never commit acts of violence: war they have no notion of; and it is a proverb among them, That a man never puts a man to death. Plato places the &s;eat of ju&s;tice and of happi|ne&s;s among the fir&s;t men; and among them exi&s;ted the golden age, if it ever did exi&s;t. But when a nation, becoming populous, begins with rearing flocks and herds, proceeds to appropriate land, and is not &s;atisfied without matters of luxury over and above; &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and pride gain ground, and be|come ruling and unruly pa&s;&s;ions. Cau&s;es of di&s;cord multiply, vent is given to avarice and re&s;entment; and among a people not yet perfectly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to government, di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions rage, and threaten a total di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety: nothing indeed &s;u&s;pends the impending blow, but the unwearied, though &s;i|lent,
<PB N="168" REF="172">
operation of the &s;ocial appetite. Such was the condition of the Greeks at a certain period of their progre&s;s, as mentioned above; and &s;uch was the condition of Europe, and of France in particu|lar, during the anarchy of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, when all was di&s;cord, blood, and rapine. In general, wherever avarice and di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions bear rule, I boldly pronounce, that men are ill qualified for &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Providence extracts order out of confu&s;ion. Men, in a &s;ociety &s;o uncomfortable, are taught by dire experience, that they mu&s;t either renounce &s;ociety, or qualify them&s;elves for it&mdash;the choice is ea&s;y, but how difficult the practice! After infinite &s;truggles, appetite for &s;ociety prevailed; and time, that uni|ver&s;al conqueror, perfected men in the art of &s;ub|duing their pa&s;&s;ions, or of di&s;&s;embling them. Find|ing now no enjoyment but in &s;ociety, we are &s;oli|citous about the good-will of others; and we adhere to ju&s;tice and good manners: di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, kindly affections encouraged, and men become le&s;s unfit for &s;ociety than formerly.</P>
<P>But is the progre&s;s of men toward the perfection of &s;ociety to &s;top here? are lu&s;t of power and of property to continue for ever leading principles? are envy, revenge, treachery, deceit, never to have an end? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How devoutly to be wi&s;hed, (it will be &s;aid), that all men were upright and hone&s;t; and that all of the &s;ame nation were united like a &s;in|gle family in concord and mutual affection! Here indeed would be perpetual &s;un&s;hine, a gold|en age, a &s;tate approaching to that of good men made perfect in heavenly man&s;ions."</Q> Beware of indulging &s;uch plea&s;ing dreams. The &s;y&s;tem of Providence differs widely from our wi&s;hes; and &s;hall ignorant man venture to arraign Providence? Are we qualified to judge of the whole, when but &s;o &s;mall a part is vi&s;ible? It is our duty to believe,
<PB N="169" REF="173">
that were the whole vi&s;ible, it would appear beau|tiful. We are not however reduced to an act of pure faith: a glimmering light, breaking in, makes it at lea&s;t doubtful, whether upon the whole it be not really better for us to be as we are. Let us follow that glimmering light to &s;ee where it will lead us.</P>
<P>I begin with ob&s;erving, that tho' in our pre&s;ent condition we &s;uffer much di&s;tre&s;s from &s;elfi&s;h and di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, yet cu&s;tom renders our di&s;tre&s;&s;es familiar, and hardens us not only to bear but to brave them. Strict adherence to the rules of ju&s;tice would indeed &s;ecure our per&s;ons and our property: robbery and murder would vani&s;h, and locks and guns be heard of no more. So far excellent, were no new evils to come in their place: but the void mu&s;t be filled, and mental di&s;tre&s;&s;es would break in of various kinds, &s;uch particularly as proceed from refined delicacy and nice &s;en&s;ibility of honour, little regarded while we are expo&s;ed to dangers more alarming. And whether the change would be much to our advantage, appears doubtful: pain as well as plea&s;ure is mea&s;ured by compari&s;on; and the &s;lighte&s;t pain, &s;uch for example, as ari&s;es from a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of civility or good-breeding, will over|whelm a per&s;on who has never &s;elt any more &s;evere. At any rate, natural evils will remain; and that extreme delicacy and &s;oftne&s;s of temper which are produced by eternal peace and concord, would ren|der &s;uch evils in&s;upportable: the &s;light inconve|niencies of a rough road, bad weather, or homely fare, would become &s;erious evils, and afflict the traveller pa&s;t enduring. The French, among whom &s;ociety has obtained a more refined poli&s;h than in any other nation, have become &s;o &s;oft and delicate as to lo&s;e all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ortitude in di&s;tre&s;s. They cannot bear even a repre&s;entation of &s;evere affliction in a tra|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">dy: an Engli&s;h audience would fall a&s;leep at the
<PB N="170" REF="174">
&s;light di&s;tre&s;&s;es that make a deep impre&s;&s;ion in the French theatre.</P>
<P>But now &s;uppo&s;ing, that a &s;crupulous adherence to the rules of morality would be a real improve|ment in &s;ociety; yet to me it appears evident, that men as individuals would &s;uffer more by that im|provement, than they would gain as members of &s;ociety. In order to pre&s;erve the rules of ju&s;tice un|tainted, and to maintain perfect concord and affec|tion among men, all di&s;&s;ocial and &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be extirpated, or brought under ab&s;olute &s;ubjection. Attend to the con&s;equences: they de&s;erve our mo&s;t &s;ober attention. Agitation is requi&s;ite to the mind as well as to the body: a man engaged in a bri&s;k pur&s;uit, whether of bu&s;ine&s;s or of plea&s;ure, is in his element, and in high &s;pirits; but when no object is in view to be attained or to be avoided, his &s;pirits flag, and he &s;inks into languor and de&s;pondence. To prevent a condition &s;o bane|ful to man, he is provided with many pa&s;&s;ions, which impel him to action without intermi&s;&s;ion, and envigorate both mind and body. But, upon the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;carce any motive to action would remain; and man, reduced to a lethargic &s;tate, would rival no being above an oy&s;ter or a &s;en&s;itive plant.</P>
<P>Nor ought it to be overlooked, that an uniform life of peace, tranquillity, and &s;ecurity, would not be long reli&s;hed. Con&s;tant repetition of the &s;ame plea&s;ures would render even a golden age ta&s;tele&s;s, like an Italian &s;ky during a long &s;ummer. Nature has for wi&s;e purpo&s;es impre&s;&s;ed upon us a ta&s;te for variety<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 1. p. 320. edit. 5.</NOTE>; and without it, life would be altoge|ther in&s;ipid. Paragua, when governed by the Je&s;uits, affords a fine illu&s;tration. It was divided into pari&s;hes, in each of which a Je&s;uit pre&s;ided as

king, prie&s;t, and prophet. The natives were not &s;uffered to have any property, but laboured ince&s;|&s;antly for their daily bread, which was delivered to them out of a public magazine. The men were employed in agriculture, the women in &s;pinning; and certain preci&s;e hours were allotted for labour, for food, for prayer, and for &s;leep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ide Paragua tea, for which there is great de|mand in Peru, cotton, tobacco, and &s;ugar-canes, were cultivated in Paragua, and the product was &s;tored up in magazines.

The fathers &s;eldom inflicted a capital puni&s;h|ment, becau&s;e it deprived them of a profitable &s;lave.</NOTE>. They &s;unk into &s;uch a li&s;tle&s;s &s;tate of mind, as to have no re|gret at dying when attacked by di&s;ea&s;e or by old age. Such was their indifference about what might befall them, that tho' they adored the Je&s;uits, yet they made no oppo&s;ition, when the fathers were, ann. 1767, attacked by the Spaniards, and their famous republic demoli&s;hed. The monki&s;h life is contradictory to the nature of man: the languor of that &s;tate is what, in all probability, tempts many a monk and nun, to find occupation even at the ex|pence of virtue. The lives of the Malte&s;e knights is far from being agreeable, now that their knight|errantry again&s;t the Turks has &s;ub&s;ided. While they re&s;ide in the i&s;land, a &s;trict uniformity in their manner of living is horridly irk&s;ome. Ab&s;ence is their only relief, when they can obtain permi&s;&s;ion. There will not at la&s;t remain a knight in the i&s;land, except &s;uch as by office are tied to attendance.</P>
<P>I proceed to another con&s;ideration. Familiarity with danger is nece&s;&s;ary to eradicate our natural timidity; and &s;o deeply rooted is that principle, that familiarity with danger of one &s;ort does not
<PB N="172" REF="176">
harden us with re&s;pect to any other &s;ort. A &s;oldier, bold as a lion in the field, is faint-hearted at &s;ea, like a child; and a &s;eaman, who braves the winds and waves, trembles when mounted on a hor&s;e of &s;pirit. Courage does not &s;uperabound at pre&s;ent, even in the mid&s;t of dangers and unfore&s;een acci|dents: &s;edentary manufacturers, who &s;eldom are in the way of harm, are remarkably pu&s;illanimous. What would men be in the &s;uppo&s;ed condition of univer&s;al peace, concord, and &s;ecurity? they would rival a hare or a mou&s;e in timidity. Farewell, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, to courage, magnanimity, heroi&s;m, and to every pa&s;&s;ion that ennobles human nature! There may perhaps be men, who, hug|ging them&s;elves in being &s;ecure again&s;t harm, would not be altogether aver&s;e to &s;uch degeneracy. But if &s;uch men there be, I pray them only to re|flect, that in the progre&s;s from infancy to maturity, all nations do not ripen equally. One nation may have arrived at the &s;uppo&s;ed perfection of &s;ociety, before another has advanced much beyond the &s;a|vage &s;tate. What &s;ecurity hath the former again&s;t the latter? Preci&s;ely the &s;ame that timid &s;heep have again&s;t hungry wolves.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h with one other effect of the &s;uppo&s;ed perfection of &s;ociety, more degrading, if po&s;&s;ible, than any mentioned. Exerci&s;e, as ob&s;erved above, is not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the mind than to the body. The rea&s;oning faculty, for example, without con|&s;tant and varied exerci&s;e, will remain weak and un|di&s;tingui&s;hing to the end of life. By what means doth a man acquire prudence and fore&s;ight, but by practice? It is preci&s;ely here as in the body: de|prive a child of motion, and it will never acquire any &s;trength of limbs. The many difficulties that men encounter, and their various objects of pur&s;uit, rou&s;e the under&s;tanding, and &s;et the rea&s;oning fa|culty
<PB N="173" REF="177">
at work for means to accompli&s;h de&s;ire. The mind, by continual exerci&s;e, ripens to its perfec|tion; and, by the &s;ame means, is pre&s;erved in vigour. It would have no &s;uch exerci&s;e in the &s;up|po&s;ed perfection of &s;ociety; where there would be little to be de&s;ired, and le&s;s to be dreaded: our mental faculties would for ever lie dormant; and we &s;hould remain for ever ignorant that we have &s;uch faculties. The people of Paragua are de|&s;cribed as mere children in under&s;tanding. What wonder, con&s;idering their condition under Je&s;uit government, without ambition, without property, without fear of want, and without de&s;ires? The wants of tho&s;e who inhabit the torrid zone are ea&s;ily &s;upplied: they need no cloathing, &s;carce any habitation; and fruits, which ripen there to per|fection, give them food without labouring for it. Need we any other cau&s;e for their inferiority of un|der&s;tanding, compared with the inhabitants of other climates, where the mind, as well as body, are con&s;tantly at work for procuring nece&s;&s;aries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ble&s;&s;ings of ea&s;e and inaction are mo&s;t poeti|cally di&s;play'd in the following de&s;cription. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O felix Lapo, qui in ultimo angulo mundi &s;ic bene lates, con|tentus et innocens.

What are the means that fit men for &s;ociety, is explained above; but writers are far from being unanimous about the means that fit them for government. All agree, that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to our governors is a duty: but they appear to be at a lo&s;s upon what foundation to re&s;t that duty; as if it were not evident, that by our nature we are fitted for government as well as for &s;ociety<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Principles of Equity, p. 177. edit. 2.</NOTE>. If ju&s;tice or veracity be e&s;&s;ential to &s;ociety, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government is no le&s;s &s;o; and each of the&s;e equally is declared by the moral &s;en&s;e to be our duty. But to qualify man for go|vernment, the duty of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion alone is not &s;uf|ficient: diver&s;ity of temper and of talents are al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary; and accordingly it is &s;o ordered by Pro|vidence, that there are never wanting in any &s;ociety men who are qualified to lead, as well as men who are di&s;po&s;ed to follow. Where a number of people convene for any purpo&s;e, &s;ome will naturally a&s;|&s;ume authority without the formality of election, and the re&s;t will as naturally &s;ubmit. A regular government, founded on laws, was probably not

And men, finding vent for their di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t other tribes, were fond to live peaceably at home. In|troduction of money made an amazing change. Wealth be&s;tow'd by fortune, or procured by rapine, made an impre&s;&s;ion on the vulgar: different ranks were recognized: the rich became imperious, and the poor mutinous. Selfi&s;hne&s;s, prevailing over &s;ocial affection, &s;tirred up every man again&s;t his neighbour; and men, overlooking their natural enemies, gave vent to di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions within their own tribe. It became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen the hands of the &s;overeign, for repre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions in|flamed by opulence, which tend to a di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety.

<HEAD>Different FORMS OF GOVERNMENT compared.</HEAD>
<P>OF all governments, democracy is the mo&s;t tur|bulent: de&s;poti&s;m, which benumbs the men|tal faculties, and relaxes every &s;pring of action, is in the oppo&s;ite extreme. Mixed governments, whether monarchical or republican, &s;tand in the middle: they promote activity, but &s;eldom any dangerous exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Pure democracy, like that of Athens, Argos, and Carthage, is the very wor&s;t form of government, if we make not de&s;poti&s;m an exception. The people, in whom re&s;ides the &s;overeign power, are in&s;olent in pro&s;perity, timid in adver&s;ity, cruel in anger, blind and prodigal in affection, and incapable of embrac|ing &s;teadily a prudent mea&s;ure. Thucydides re|lates<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. 5.</NOTE>, that Agis with a gallant army of Spartans &s;urrounded the army of Agos; and, though &s;ecure of victory, &s;uffered them to retreat, upon &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances from Thra&s;yllus, the Argian general, of terminating all differences in an amicable treaty; Agis, perhaps ju&s;tly, was bitterly cen&s;ured for &s;uf|fering victory to &s;lip out of his hands: but the Ar|gians, dreaming of victory when the danger was over, brought their general to trial, confi&s;cated his effects, and would have &s;toned him to death, had he not taken refuge in a temple. Two Athenian generals, after one naval victory, being intent on a &s;econd, deputed Theramenes to perform the la&s;t duty to their dead. A violent &s;torm prevented
<PB N="184" REF="188">
Theramenes from executing the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him; but it did not prevent the people of Athens from putting their two generals to death, as if they had neglected their duty. The fate of Socrates is a &s;ad in&s;tance of the changeable, as well as violent, di&s;po&s;ition of a democratical &s;tate. He was con|demned to death, for attempting innovations in the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion: the &s;entence was gro&s;sly un|ju&s;t; for he attempted no innovation; but only, among his friends, expre&s;&s;ed purer notions of the Deity than were common in Greece at that time. But his funeral ob&s;equies were &s;carce ended, when bitter remor&s;e &s;eized the people. His accu&s;ers were put to death without trial, every per&s;on bani&s;hed who had contributed to the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t him, and his &s;tatue was erected in the mo&s;t public part of the city. The great Scipio, in his camp near Utica, was &s;urrounded with three Car|thaginian armies, which waited only for day-light to fall upon him. He prevented the impending blow, by &s;urpri&s;ing them in the dead of night; which gave him a complete victory. This misfor|tune, for it could &s;carce be called bad conduct, provoked the democracy of Carthage, to pronounce &s;entence of death again&s;t A&s;drubal their general. Great trading towns cannot flouri&s;h, if they be not faithful to their engagements, and hone&s;t in their dealings: Whence then the Fides Punica? A de|mocracy is in its nature ra&s;h, violent, and fluctuat|ing; and the Carthaginians merited the reproach, not as individuals, but as a democratical &s;tate.</P>
<P>A commonwealth, governed by the be&s;t citizens, is very different from a democracy, where the mob rules. At the &s;ame time, the &s;olid foundation of &s;uch a commonwealth is, equality among the citi|zens. Inequality of riches cannot be prevented in a commercial &s;tate; but inequality of privileges may be prevented, by excluding no citizen from the
<PB N="185" REF="189">
opportunity of commanding as well as of obeying. The invidious di&s;tinction of Patrician and Plebeian was a gro&s;s malady in the Roman republic, a per|petual &s;ource of di&s;&s;en&s;ion between two bodies of men, equally well born, equally rich, and equally fit for war. This ill-poi&s;ed government would have put an end to the republic, had not the Plebeians prevailed, who were the more numerous. That reformation produced to Rome plenty of able men, qualified to govern whether in peace or in war.</P>
<P>A commonwealth is the be&s;t form of government for a &s;mall &s;tate: there is little room for inequality of rank or of property: and the people can act in a body. Monarchy is preferable for a large &s;tate, where the people, widely &s;pread, cannot be ea&s;ily collected into a body. Attica was a kingdom, while its twelve cantons were remote from each other, and but &s;lenderly connected. The&s;eus, by collect|ing the people of figure into the city of Athens, and by a general a&s;&s;embly of all the cantons held there, fitted Attica to be a commonwealth.</P>
<P>When a nation becomes great and populous, it is ill fitted for being a commonwealth. Ambition is apt to trample upon ju&s;tice; &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s upon pa|trioti&s;m; and the public is &s;acrificed to private views. To prevent corruption from turning incurable, the only remedy is a &s;trict rotation in office, which ought never to be di&s;pen&s;ed with on any pretext<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A commonwealth with &s;uch a rotation may be apt|ly compared to a group of jets d'eau, ri&s;ing one above another in beautiful order, and pre&s;erving the &s;ame or|der in de&s;cending: the form of the group continues in|variable, but the forming parts are always changing.</NOTE>. By &s;uch rotation, every citizen in his turn governs and is governed: the highe&s;t office is limited as to time, and the greate&s;t men in the &s;tate mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the &s;acred law of obeying as well as of command|ing.
<PB N="186" REF="190">
A man long accu&s;tomed to power is not happy in a private &s;tation: that corrupting habit is prevented by an alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of public and private life; which is more agreeable by variety, and contributes no le&s;s to virtue than to happine&s;s. It was that form of government in ancient Rome, which produced citizens without number, illu&s;tri|ous for virtue and talents. Reflect upon Cincinna|tus, eminent among heroes for di&s;intere&s;ted love to his country. Had he been a Briton, a &s;eat in par|liament would have gratified his ambition, as afford|ing the be&s;t opportunity of &s;erving his country. In parliament he joins the party that appears the mo&s;t zealous for the public. Being deceived in his friends, patriots in name only, not in reality, he goes over to the court; and, after fighting the bat|tles of the mini&s;try for years, he is compelled by a &s;hattered fortune to accept a po&s;t or a pen&s;ion, Fortunate Cincinnatus! born at a time and in a country where virtue was the pa&s;&s;port to power and glory. Cincinnatus, after &s;erving with honour and reputation as chief magi&s;trate, chearfully retired to a private &s;tation, in obedience to the laws of his country: nor was that change a hard&s;hip on a man who was not corrupted by a long habit of power.</P>
<P>Political writers define a free &s;tate to be, where the people are governed by laws of their own mak|ing. This definition is lame; for laws made by the people are not always ju&s;t. There were many unju&s;t laws enacted in Athens during the democrati|cal government; and in Britain in&s;tances are not wanting of laws, not only unju&s;t, but oppre&s;&s;ive. The true definition of a free &s;tate is, where the legi&s;lature adheres &s;trictly to the laws of nature; and calculates everyone of its regulations for improv|ing &s;ociety, and for promoting indu&s;try and hone&s;ty among the people.

Martius, and there burnt upon a high &s;tage with great &s;olemnity. When the flames a&s;cend, an eagle is let loo&s;e, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to carry the &s;oul of the Emperor to heaven. Is that farce le&s;s ridiculous than a puppet-&s;hew? Is it not much more ridiculous? Dull mu&s;t have been the &s;pectator who could behold the &s;olemnity without &s;miling at lea&s;t, if not laughing outright; but the Romans were cru&s;hed by de&s;poti&s;m, and nothing could provoke them to laugh. That ridiculous farce continued to be acted till the time of Con&s;tantine: how much later I know not.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t countries have been depopulated by de&s;poti&s;m; witne&s;s Greece, Egypt, and the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia. The river Menam, in the kingdom of Siam, overflows annually like the Nile, depo&s;iting a quan|tity of &s;lime, which proves a rich manure. The river &s;eems to ri&s;e gradually as the rice grows; and retires to its channel when the rice, approaching to maturity, needs no longer to be watered. Nature be&s;ide has be&s;towed on that rich country variety of delicious fruits, requiring &s;carce any culture. In &s;uch a paradi&s;e, would one imagine that the Siamites are a mi&s;erable people? The government is de&s;po|tic, and the &s;ubjects are &s;laves: they mu&s;t work for their monarch &s;ix months every year, without wages, and even without receiving any food from him. What renders them &s;till more mi&s;erable is, that they have no protection either for their per&s;ons or their goods: the grandees are expo&s;ed to the rapacity of the king and his courtiers; and the lower ranks are expo&s;ed to the rapacity of the grandees. When a man has the mis|fortune to po&s;&s;e&s;s a tree remarkable for good fruit, he is required in the name of the King, or of a courtier, to pre&s;erve the fruit for their u&s;e. Every proprietor of a garden in the neighbourhood of the capital mu&s;t pay a yearly &s;um to the keeper of
<PB N="190" REF="194">
the elephants; otherwi&s;e it will be laid wa&s;te by the&s;e animals, whom it is high trea&s;on to mole&s;t. From the &s;ea-port of Mergui to the capital, one travels ten or twelve days through immen&s;e plains of a rich &s;oil, finely watered. That country ap|pears to have been formerly cultivated, but is now quite depopulated, and left to tigers and elephants. Formerly, an immen&s;e commerce was carried on in that fertile country: hi&s;torians atte&s;t, that in the middle of the &s;ixteenth century above a thou|&s;and foreign &s;hips frequented its ports annually. But the King, tempted with &s;o much riches, endea|voured to engro&s;s all the commerce of his country; by which means he annihilated &s;ucce&s;&s;ively mines, manufactures, and even agriculture. The country is depopulated, and few remain there but beggars. In the i&s;land Ceylon, the King is &s;ole proprietor of the land; and the people are &s;upinely indolent: their huts are mean, without any thing like furni|ture: their food is fruit that grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly; and their covering is a piece of coar&s;e cloth, wrap|ped round the middle. The &s;ettlement of the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company at the Cape of Good Hope is profitable to them in their commerce with the Ea&s;t Indies; and it would be much more profi|table, if they gave proper encouragement to the tenants and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of their lands. But the&s;e poor people are ruled with a rod of iron: what the company wants is extorted from them at &s;o low a price as &s;carce to afford them common nece&s;&s;aries. Avarice, like many other irregular pa&s;&s;ions, ob|&s;tructs its own gratification: were indu&s;try duly en|couraged, the product of the ground would be in greater plenty, and goods be afforded voluntarily at a lower price than they are at pre&s;ent obtained by violence. The Peruvians are a &s;ad example of the effects of tyranny; being reduced to a &s;tate of &s;tupid

in&s;en&s;ibility. No motive to action influences them; neither riches, nor luxury, nor ambition: they are even indifferent about life. The &s;ingle plea&s;ure they feel is, to get drunk, in order to forget their mi&s;ery. The provinces of Moldavia, Walachia, and Be&s;&s;arabia, &s;ituated between the 43d and 48th degrees of latitude, are defended on three &s;ides by the Nie&s;ter, the Black Sea, and the Danube. The climate of that region, and the fertility of its &s;oil, render it not inferior to any other country in Eu|rope. Its pa&s;tures, in particular, are excellent, producing admirable hor&s;es, with an incredible number of &s;heep and horned cattle; and its indu&s;|trial fruits, &s;uch as corn, wine, oil, honey, and wax, were formerly produced in great plenty. So populous was that region a few centuries ago, that the prince of Walachia was able, in that province alone, to rai&s;e an army of &s;eventy thou&s;and men. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e advantages, the wretched policy of the Turki&s;h government has reduced the&s;e provinces to be almo&s;t a de&s;ert. A de&s;potic government &s;tifles, in the birth, all the bounties of nature, and renders the fine&s;t &s;pots of the globe equally &s;terile with its barren mountains. When a patriotic king travels about to vi&s;it his dominions, he is received with acclamations of joy. A de&s;potic prince dares not hope for &s;uch reception: he is locked up in his &s;eraglio, ig|norant of what pa&s;&s;es; and indolently &s;uffers his people to be pillaged, without even hearing of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, de&s;poti&s;m, though calculated to elevate the Sovereign above the rules of ju&s;tice, and to make him the only free per&s;on in his domi|nions, tends, above all other governments, to ren|der him in&s;ecure. He becomes odious by oppre&s;&s;i|on; and every hand would be rai&s;ed again&s;t him,
<PB N="192" REF="196">
but for the re&s;traint of fear. A &s;ituation &s;o tickli&s;h lays him open to every bold &s;pirit, prompted by revenge to &s;eek his ruin, or by ambition to u&s;urp his throne. In that re&s;pect, Ru&s;&s;ia and Turkey are preci&s;ely &s;imilar: con&s;piracies again&s;t the Sove|reign are equally frequent, and equally &s;ucce&s;sful. The moment an u&s;urper &s;eizes the palace, all ob|&s;tructions vani&s;h: all pro&s;trate them&s;elves before the throne, without enquiring about the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's title. In that manner was the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia e&s;tabli&s;hed, notwith&s;tanding a very unfavou|rable circum&s;tance, that of dethroning her own hu&s;band Peter III. No free &s;pirit regrets &s;uch events in a de&s;potic government: the only thing to be regretted is, that they concern the monarch only; not the people, who remain abject &s;laves as formerly. The pre&s;ent Empre&s;s, &s;en&s;ible of her precarious &s;ituation, is intent to humanize her people, and to moderate the de&s;poti&s;m. In that view, &s;he has publi&s;hed a code of laws fit for a limited monarchy, and expre&s;&s;ing great regard to the lives, liberties, and property of her &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>But a monarchy, with all the moderation that de&s;poti&s;m can admit, is incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty of the pre&s;s. Political pamphlets, and even news|papers, are no le&s;s u&s;eful for in&s;tructing the King, than for &s;ecuring his &s;ubjects. In France, the mi|ni&s;try are deprived of that means of acquiring knowledge; and are reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of tru&s;ting to in&s;inuating men, who cunningly creep into favour, with a view to their own intere&s;t. After the late peace, 1763, that mini&s;try formed a plan for e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony in Guiana; and no fewer than twelve thou&s;and per&s;ons were landed there all at one time. But &s;o gro&s;sly ignorant were they of the preparations nece&s;&s;ary for planting a colony in the torrid zone, that contagious di&s;ea&s;es, occa&s;i|oned

<P>I have in&s;i&s;ted longer upon the deplorable effects of de&s;poti&s;m than perhaps is nece&s;&s;ary; but I was fond of the opportunity to ju&s;tify, or rather applaud the &s;pirit of liberty &s;o eminent in the inhabitants of Britain. I now proceed to compare different forms of government, with re&s;pect to various parti|culars; beginning with patrioti&s;m. Every form of government mu&s;t be good that in&s;pires patrioti&s;m; and the be&s;t form to invigorate that noble pa&s;&s;ion is a commonwealth founded on rotation of power, where it is the &s;tudy of tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e in office to do good, and to merit approbation from their fellow-citizens. In the Swi&s;s Cantons, the &s;alaries of magi&s;trates and public officers are &s;carce &s;ufficient to defray their expences; and tho&s;e worthy per&s;ons de&s;ire no other recompence, but to be e&s;teemed and honour|ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No human work can be everla&s;ting. The &s;eventy-two bailiages of the exten&s;ive canton of Bern threaten ruin to the republic. Tho&s;e lucrative offices, which the great council appropriates to its own members, oc|ca&s;ion a con&s;tant influx of riches into the capital. Pa|trioti&s;m is ob&s;erved, of late years, to be on the decline among the citizens of Bern; and no wonder, con&s;ider|ing that luxury and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s are the never-failing off|&s;pring of opulence. When &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s becomes the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of that people, tho&s;e in power will pilfer the public trea&s;ure, which is immen&s;e, and enrich them|&s;elves with the &s;poils of the republic. Confu&s;ion and anarchy mu&s;t en&s;ue, and the &s;tate will &s;ettle in a mo|narchy, or, more probably, in an odious democracy.</NOTE>. A republic &s;o modelled in&s;pires virtues of every &s;ort. The people of Switzerland &s;eldom
<PB N="194" REF="198">
think of writing to confirm a bargain: a law|&s;uit is &s;carce known among them; and many there are who have never heard of an advocate nor of an attorney. Their doors are never &s;hut but in winter. It is patrioti&s;m that Monte&s;quieu has in view, when he pronounces virtue to be the leading principle in a republic. He has rea&s;on to term it &s;o, becau&s;e patrioti&s;m is connected with every &s;ocial virtue; and, when it vani&s;hes, men regard them&s;elves only, not their fellow-citizens. De|mocracy will never be recommended by any en|lightened politician, as a good form of govern|ment; were it for no other rea&s;on, but that pa|trioti&s;m cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t where the mob go|verns. In monarchy, the king is exalted &s;o high above his &s;ubjects, that his mini&s;ters are little bet|ter than &s;ervants. Such condition is not friendly to patrioti&s;m: it is as little friendly to ambition; for mini&s;ters are &s;till &s;ervants, however much rai&s;ed above other &s;ubjects. Wealth, being the only re|maining pur&s;uit, promotes avarice to be their ruling pa&s;&s;ion. Now, if patrioti&s;m be not found in mini|&s;ters who have power, far le&s;s in men who have no power; and thus in monarchy, riches are pre|ferred before virtue, and every vicious offspring of avarice has free cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Without piercing to the foundation, one can have no ju&s;t notion of the various forms that go|vernment a&s;&s;umes in different &s;tates. Monarchy is of many different kinds, and &s;o is a republic. Rome and Carthage, the two great rival republics of ancient times, differed widely in their original con|&s;titution. Much has been &s;aid of the&s;e republics by hi&s;torians and political writers. There is one point of compari&s;on that will &s;et in a clear light the difference of their con&s;titutions, with re&s;pect to peace and war. Carthage, advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated
<PB N="195" REF="199">
for commerce, became a great and flouri&s;hing trad|ing town. The Carthaginians, having no object but riches, admitted none into a participation of their privileges. War was again&s;t their genius: but conque&s;t was not, if it produced wealth; and therefore they made war in order to load their new &s;ubjects with taxes. Rome, on the contrary, was ill &s;ituated for commerce: its inhabitants were, from the beginning, employed in war, either de|fen&s;ive or offen&s;ive. Their great object accordingly was power; to which end they were always di&s;|po&s;ed to adopt, as citizens, the be&s;t of tho&s;e they conquered. Thus Rome became a city of warriors, Carthage of merchants. The &s;ubjects of the latter were always ripe for a revolt, while the &s;ubjects of the former were always faithful. Between two &s;uch &s;tates there could be no equality in war; and, had the Carthaginians been as &s;kilful in politics as they were in commerce, they would have avoided, with the &s;tricte&s;t circum&s;pection, every occa&s;ion of quarrel with the Romans. Rome employed its own citizens in war: Carthage had none to em|ploy but mercenaries. In an offen&s;ive war, the object of the latter was riches; that of the former was power and glory, motives much &s;uperior, and more animating. In a defen&s;ive war, the difference is infinite between mercenaries, who have no intere&s;t but to receive their pay, and citizens, who fight for their country, and for their wives and children. What then are we to think of Hannibal, who, rever&s;ing the laws of nature, carried on war again&s;t the Romans with an army of mercenaries, was &s;uc|ce&s;sful in every engagement, and brought them to the very brink of ruin? He certainly was the greate&s;t General the world ever &s;aw. If any one is to be excepted, it is the pre&s;ent King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="200">
I next compare different forms of government, with re&s;pect to the influence of opulence. Riches, which, joined with ambition, produce bold at|tempts for power, are, however, not dangerous in monarchy, where the &s;overeign is &s;o far &s;uperior, as to humble to the du&s;t the mo&s;t a&s;piring of his &s;ubjects. But riches, joined with ambition, are dangerous in a republic: ambition will &s;ugge&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;owing di&s;&s;ention among the leaders; riches will make the attempt &s;ucce&s;sful; and then adieu to the republic. Wealth, accumulated by commerce in Carthage and in Athens, extingui&s;h|ed patrioti&s;m, and rendered their democracy un|ju&s;t, violent, and tyrannical. It had another bad effect; which was, to make them ambitious of conque&s;t. The &s;age Plutarch charges Themi&s;to|cles with the ruin of Athens. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That great man,"</Q> &s;ays he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in&s;pired his countrymen with de&s;ire of naval power. That power produced exten&s;ive commerce, and, con&s;equently, riches: riches again, be&s;ide luxury, in&s;pired the Athenians with a high opinion of their power, and made them ra&s;hly engage in every quarrel among their neighbours."</Q> Suppre&s;s the names, and one will believe it to be a cen&s;ure on the conduct of Britain. Succe&s;sful commerce prompted the Carthaginians, again&s;t their natural intere&s;t, to make war for gain. Had they been &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the Ro|mans, both nations would have fallen a &s;acrifice to the ambition of Hannibal: after &s;ubduing Italy, what Carthaginian dur&s;t have oppo&s;ed the glorious conqueror, returning with a victorious army, de|voted to his will? That event was long dreaded by Hanno, and the wi&s;er part of the Carthaginian &s;enate; and hence their &s;canty &s;upplies to Hannibal. But what is only a &s;uppo&s;ition with re&s;pect to Car|thage proved to be the fate of Rome. Inequality

of rank, opulence, and luxury, relaxed every fun|damental principle of the commonwealth, parti|cularly rotation of power, which ought to have been their palladium. Conque&s;t at a di&s;tance led them unwarily, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to &s;u&s;pend that fundamental law, of which Cae&s;ar avail|ed him&s;elf in his Gallic war, by debauching from their duty the be&s;t di&s;ciplined army of the re|public: and it was that army, under a leader little inferior to Hannibal, which determined the fate of Rome.</P>
<P>A &s;tate with a &s;mall territory, &s;uch as Ham|burgh or Holland, may &s;ub&s;i&s;t long as a common|wealth, without much hazard from the opulence of individuals. But an exten&s;ive territory in the hands of a few opulent proprietors is dangerous in a com|monwealth; becau&s;e of their influence over num|bers who depend on them for bread. The i&s;land of Britain is too large for a commonwealth. This oc|curred to a profound political writer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Harrington.</NOTE>, who does honour to his country; and to remedy the evil, he propo&s;es an Agrarian law. But it is vain to think, that accumulation of land can be prevent|ed by an Agrarian law: a tru&s;t-deed is a ready &s;creen for covering accumulation beyond law: and dark tran&s;actions will be carried on without end; &s;imilar to what is practi&s;ed, mo&s;t di&s;hone&s;tly, by tho&s;e who elect and are elected members of par|liament. When &s;uch comes to be the condition of land-property, the Agrarian law will be ripe for di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>In early times we di&s;cover greater variety of character than at pre&s;ent; among &s;overeigns e&s;pe|cially, who are not taught to govern their pa&s;&s;ions.
<PB N="198" REF="202">
Peru&s;ing the Hi&s;tory of Spain in particular, one is &s;truck with an amazing variety of character in the Moori&s;h Kings. In &s;ome of them, outrageous cru|elty; in others, mildne&s;s, and affection for their people: in &s;ome, unbounded ambition, &s;urmount|ing every ob&s;tacle of ju&s;tice and humanity; in others, &s;trict attention to commerce, and to every moral virtue; &s;ome heaping up trea&s;ure; &s;ome &s;quandering all upon voluptuou&s;ne&s;s; &s;ome culti|vating peace; &s;ome fond of war. During the non|age of &s;ociety, men exert their natural bias with|out re&s;erve: in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, they are taught to moderate their turbulent pa&s;&s;ions: at la&s;t, mild and courtly behaviour, produced by education and imitation, give an air to men of figure, as if they were all copies from one original; which is peculiarly the ca&s;e in France. The mildne&s;s of external behaviour mu&s;t have a con&s;iderable influ|ence on the internal part; for nothing tends more to &s;often or to &s;uppre&s;s a pa&s;&s;ion, than never to give it vent; and, for that rea&s;on, ab&s;olute monarchy in France is far from being &s;o dreadful as it was for|merly. It is at pre&s;ent far from being violent or &s;anguinary; the manners of the people having the &s;ame influence there, that laws have in a free country. The King, delicate with re&s;pect to his conduct, and dreading the cen&s;ure of the world, is guilty of few exce&s;&s;es; and the people, tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, are ea&s;ily kept in order. Among men of rank, to be di&s;charged the court, or to be rele|gated to their country-&s;eats, is more terrible than a capital puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>We fini&s;h this &s;hort e&s;&s;ay with a compari&s;on of different governments, as to the execution of laws. Laws relative to property and pecuniary intere&s;t are every where pre&s;erved in vigour, becau&s;e the violation of them hurts many. Laws re&s;pecting
<PB N="199" REF="203">
the public are kept alive in monarchical govern|ments; becau&s;e the King, to whom execution of law is intru&s;ted, &s;eldom benefits by their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. For a &s;teady execution of &s;uch laws, a democracy has nothing to rely on but patrioti&s;m; and when that &s;ub&s;ides, &s;uch laws fall a&s;leep. The rea&s;on is, that the powers, both of legi&s;lature and execution, center in the people; and a multi|tude, frequently no better than a mob, will ne|ver with con&s;tancy direct execution again&s;t them|&s;elves.</P>

In later times, it was again po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by many &s;tates, Chri&s;tian and Mahometan, continually at war, till by con|que&s;t they were united in one great kingdom.

<P>A &s;econd cau&s;e is, the weakne&s;s of a great &s;tate. The &s;trength of a &s;tate doth not increa&s;e with its bulk, more than that of a man.

<P>The chief cau&s;e is the luxury and effeminacy of a great monarchy, which leave no appetite for war, either in the &s;overeign, or in his &s;ubjects. Great inequality of rank in an exten&s;ive kingdom, occa&s;ioned by a con&s;tant flow of riches in the ca|pital, introduces &s;how, expen&s;ive living, luxury, and &s;en&s;uality. Riches, by affording gratification to every &s;en&s;ual appetite, become an idol, to which all men bow the knee; and when riches are wor|&s;hipped as a pa&s;&s;port to power, as well as to plea|&s;ure, they corrupt the heart, eradicate every virtue, and fo&s;ter every vice. In &s;uch di&s;&s;olution of man|ners, contradictions are reconciled; avarice and meanne&s;s unite with vanity; di&s;&s;imulation and cunning, with &s;plendor. Where &s;ubjects are &s;o corrupted, what will the prince be, who is not taught to moderate his pa&s;&s;ions, who mea&s;ures ju&s;|tice by appetite, and who is debilitated by corpo|real plea&s;ures? Such a prince never thinks of heading his own troops, nor of extending his do|minions. Mo&s;tazen, the la&s;t Califf of Bagdat, is a con&s;picuous in&s;tance of the degeneracy de&s;cribed. His kingdom being invaded by the Tartars in the year 1258, he &s;hut him&s;elf up in his &s;eraglio with his debauched companions, as in profound peace; and, &s;tupified with &s;loth and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, was
<PB N="203" REF="207">
the only per&s;on who appeared carele&s;s about the fate of his empire. A King of Per&s;ia, being in|formed that the Turks had made them&s;elves ma|&s;ters of his be&s;t provinces, an&s;wered, that he was indifferent about their &s;ucce&s;s, provided they would not di&s;turb him in his city of I&s;pahan. Hoat&s;ang, the la&s;t Chine&s;e Emperor of the Chine&s;e race, hid him&s;elf in his palace, while the Tartars were wre&s;ting from him his northern provinces, and Li&s;tching, a rebel mandarine, was wre&s;ting from him the remainder. The Empre&s;s &s;trangled her&s;elf in her apartment; and the Emperor, making a la&s;t effort, followed her example. The ninth Chine&s;e Emperor of the blood of Genhizcan, addicted to women and prie&s;ts, was de&s;pi&s;ed by his people. A per&s;on without a name, who had been a &s;ervant in a convent of Bonzes, putting him&s;elf at the head of &s;ome robbers, dethroned the monarch, and extin|gui&s;hed the royal family.</P>
<P>The Tonquine&s;e, after a long &s;ubjection to the Emperor of China, regained their independence, and were governed by kings of their own nation. The&s;e princes having, by long peace, become in|dolent, luxurious, and effeminate, abandoned the government of the kingdom to their mini&s;ters. The governor of Cochin-china, being at a great di&s;tance from the capital, revolted fir&s;t, and that country became a &s;eparate kingdom. The gover|nor of Tonquin, within which province the King re&s;ided, u&s;urped the &s;overeignty: but, re&s;pecting the royal family, he only locked up the King in his palace; leaving to the King's de&s;cendents the name of BOVA, or King, with &s;ome &s;hadow of royalty. The U&s;urper and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors content them&s;elves with the title of CHOVA, or Genera|li&s;&s;imo; which &s;atisfies the people, who pierce no deeper than what eye-&s;ight di&s;covers.

of the &s;ame kind happened in Japan. Similar cau&s;es produce &s;imilar effects. The luxurious and indolent &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Charlemagne in the kingdom of France, tru&s;ting their power and authority with the mairs of their palace, were never &s;een in pub|lic, and were &s;eldom heard of. The great power of the&s;e officers inflamed them with an appetite for more. Pepin and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were for a long time kings de facto, leaving to the rightful &s;overeign nothing but the empty name. Charles Martel reigned for &s;ome time without even naming a king. And at la&s;t, Pepin the younger, anno 751, throw|ing off the ma&s;k, ordered him&s;elf to be proclaimed King of France.</P>

<P>Little rea&s;on, then, have we to apprehend the coalition of all nations into an univer&s;al monarchy.

An empire, &s;ubjected to effeminate princes, and devoid of patrioti&s;m, cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t entire. The fate of all, with very few exceptions, has been uniformly the &s;ame. The governors of pro|vinces, lo&s;ing all regard for a voluptuous and effe|minate monarch, take courage, &s;et up for them|&s;elves, and a&s;&s;ume regal authority, each in his own

province. The pui&s;&s;ant A&s;&s;yrian monarchy, one of the earlie&s;t we read of in hi&s;tory, after having been long a terror to its neighbours, was di&s;mem|bered by the governors of Media and of Babylon, who detached the&s;e exten&s;ive provinces from the monarchy. Mahomet and his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors erected a great empire, of which Bagdat became the capital. The latter Califfs of that race, poi|&s;oned with &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, lo&s;t all vigour of mind, and &s;unk down into &s;loth and effeminacy. The governors of the di&s;tant provinces were the fir&s;t who ventured to declare them&s;elves indepen|dent. Their &s;ucce&s;s invited other governors, who &s;tripped the Califf of his remaining provinces, leaving him nothing but the city of Bagdat; and of that he was deprived by the Tartars, who put an end to that once illu&s;trious monarchy. The &s;ame would have been the fate of the Per&s;ian em|pire, had it not been &s;ubdued by Alexander of Ma|cedon. But, after his death, it &s;ubmitted to the ordinary fate: his generals a&s;&s;umed regal power, each of them in the province he governed. Had not the Roman empire been di&s;membered by the Barbarians, it would have been di&s;membered by the governors of its provinces. The weakne&s;s of Charlemagne's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors hatched in France and in Germany an endle&s;s number of petty &s;ove|reigns. About the time that a pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-Indies by the Cape of Good Hope was di&s;|covered, the great penin&s;ula beyond the Ganges was comprehended under the powerful empire of Bi&s;nagar. Its fir&s;t monarchs had e&s;tabli&s;hed them|&s;elves by valour and military knowledge. In war, they headed their troops: in peace, they directed their mini&s;ters, vi&s;ited their dominions, and were punctual in rendering ju&s;tice to high and low. The people carried on an exten&s;ive and lucrative com|merce,
<PB N="207" REF="211">
which brought a revenue to the Emperor, that enabled him to maintain a &s;tanding army of one hundred thou&s;and foot, thirty thou&s;and hor&s;e, and &s;even hundred elephants. But pro&s;perity and opulence ruined all. The Emperors, poi&s;oned with pride and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, were now contented with &s;welling titles, in&s;tead of &s;olid fame. King of kings, and Hu&s;band of a thou&s;and wives, were at the head of a long catalogue of &s;uch pom|pous, but empty epithets. Corrupted by flattery, they affected divine honours, and appeared rarely in public; leaving the care of their dominions to their mini&s;ters, and to the governors of their pro|vinces. At the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, neighbouring princes encroached on all &s;ides. In the year 1565, Bi&s;nagar, the capital, was taken and &s;acked by four Moori&s;h kings. The governors of the provinces declared them&s;elves independent; and out of that great empire &s;prung the kingdoms of Golconda, Vi&s;apour, and &s;everal others. The empire of Hindo&s;tan, once widely extended, is now reduced to a very &s;mall kingdom, under a prince, who no longer is intitled to be de&s;igned the Great Mogul; the governors of his provinces having, as u&s;ual, declared them&s;elves independent.</P>
<P>Our North-American colonies are in a pro&s;pe|rous condition, increa&s;ing rapidly in population and in opulence. The coloni&s;ts have the &s;pirit of a free people, and are enflamed with patrioti&s;m. Their population will equal that of Britain and Ireland in le&s;s than a century; and they will then be a match for the mother-country, if they chu&s;e to be inde|pendent: every advantage will be on their &s;ide, as the attack mu&s;t be by &s;ea, from a very great di&s;|tance. Being thus delivered from a foreign yoke, their fir&s;t care will be, the choice of a proper go|vernment; and it is not difficult to fore&s;ee what go|vernment
<PB N="208" REF="212">
will be cho&s;en. A people, animated with the new ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and independence, will not incline to a kingly government. The Swi&s;s can|tons joined in a federal union, for protection again&s;t the potent hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and the Dutch em|braced the like union, for protection again&s;t the more potent King of Spain. But our colonies will never join in &s;uch a union; becau&s;e they have no potent neighbour, and becau&s;e they have an aver|&s;ion to each other. We may pronounce then, with tolerable certainty, that each colony will chu&s;e for it&s;elf a republican government. And their pre&s;ent con&s;titution prepares them for it: they have a &s;e|nate; and they have an a&s;&s;embly repre&s;enting the people. No change will be nece&s;&s;ary, but to drop the governor, who repre&s;ents the King of Britain. And thus a part of a great &s;tate will be converted into many &s;mall &s;tates.</P>

<P>NEIGHBOURS, according to the common &s;aying, mu&s;t be &s;weet friends or bitter ene|mies: patrioti&s;m is vigorous in &s;mall &s;tates; and the hatred to neighbouring &s;tates no le&s;s &s;o: both vani&s;h in a great monarchy.</P>

<P>Small &s;tates, however corrupted, are not liable to de&s;poti&s;m: the people being contiguous to the &s;eat of government, and accu&s;tomed to &s;ee their gover|nors daily, talk familiarly of their errors, and pub|li&s;h them every where.

for that rea&s;on, is very little dangerous. The Ro|man Pretorian bands were billeted in the towns near Rome; and three cohorts only were employed in guarding that city. Sejanus, perfect of the&s;e bands under Tiberius, lodged the three cohorts in a &s;paci|ous barrack within the city, in order to gain more authority over them, and to wean them from fami|liarity with the people. Tacitus, in the 4th book of his Annals, relates the &s;tory in the following words. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Vim praefecturae modicam antea, in|tendit, di&s;per&s;as per urbem cohortes una in ca&s;tra conducendo; ut &s;imul imperia acciperent, nu|meroque et robore, et vi&s;u, inter &s;e, fiducia ip&s;is, in caeteros metus, crearetur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He extended the power of the prefecture, by collecting into one camp tho&s;e Pretorian cohorts which were formerly di&s;per&s;ed all over the city; that thus, being united, they might be more influenced by his orders, and while their confidence in their power was increa&s;ed by the con&s;tant view of their own numbers and &s;trength, they might at the &s;ame time &s;trike a great terror in others."</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>What is &s;aid above &s;ugge&s;ts the cau&s;e of a curi|ous fact recorded in ancient hi&s;tory, viz.

Other rea&s;ons concur: the &s;ubjects of a great &s;tate are dazzled with the &s;plendor of their monarch; and as their union is prevented by di&s;tance, the monarch can &s;afely employ a part of his &s;ubjects again&s;t the re&s;t, or a &s;tanding army again&s;t all.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="215">
A great &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es one eminent advantage, viz. ability to execute magnificent works. The hanging gardens of Babylon, the pyramids of Egypt, and its lake Meris, are illu&s;trious examples. The city of Heliopolis in Syria, named Balbek by the Turks, is a pregnant in&s;tance of the power and opulence of the Roman empire. Even in the ruins of that city, there are remains of great magnifi|cence and exqui&s;ite ta&s;te. If the imperial palace, or the temple of the Sun, to mention no other building, were the work of any European prince exi&s;ting at pre&s;ent, it would make a capital figure in the annals of his reign. And yet &s;o little eclat did the&s;e works make at the time of execution, that there is not a hint of them in any hi&s;torian. The beneficence of &s;ome great monarchs is worthy of &s;till greater prai&s;e. In the principal roads of Japan hot baths are erected at proper di&s;tances, with other conveniencies, for the u&s;e of travellers. The be|neficence of the Chine&s;e government to tho&s;e who &s;uffer &s;hipwreck, gives a more advantageous im|pre&s;&s;ion of that monarchy, than all that is painfully collected by Du Halde. To verify the ob&s;ervation, I joyfully lay hold of the following incident. In the year 1728, the &s;hip Prince George took her departure from Calcutta in Bengal for Canton in China, with a cargo L. 60,000 value. A violent &s;torm drove her a&s;hore at a place named Timpau, a great way we&s;t from Canton. Not above half the crew could make the &s;hore, worn out with fatigue and hunger, and not doubting of being ma&s;|&s;acred by the natives. How amazed were they to be treated with remarkable humanity! A mandarin appeared, who not only provided for them victuals in plenty, but al&s;o divers to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in fi&s;hing the wreck. What follows is in the words of my author, Alexander Wedderburn of St. Germains, a gentleman of known worth and veracity, who bore
<PB N="212" REF="216">
office in the &s;hip. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In a few days we recovered L. 5000 in bullion, and afterward L. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,000 more. Before we &s;et forward to Canton, the mandarin our benefactor took an exact account of our money, with the names of the men, fur|ni&s;hed us with an e&s;cort to conduct us through his di&s;trict, and con&s;igned us dead or alive to one Suqua at Canton, a Chine&s;e merchant well known to the Engli&s;h there. In every one of our re&s;ting-places, victuals were brought to us by the villagers in plenty, and with great cordi|ality. In this manner we pa&s;&s;ed from one di&s;trict to another, without having occa&s;ion to lay out a &s;ingle farthing, till we reached Canton, which we did in nine days, travelling &s;ometimes by land, and &s;ometimes by water. Our ca&s;e had been repre&s;ented to the court at Pekin, from whence orders came to di&s;tribute among&s;t us a &s;um of money; which was done by the Chuntuck, Hoppo, and other officers, civil and military, a&s;&s;embled in great &s;tate. After a &s;hort &s;peech, expre&s;&s;ing regret for our calamity, with an eulo|gium on the humane and generous di&s;po&s;ition of their ma&s;ter; to each of us was pre&s;ented the Emperor's bounty, in a yellow bag, on which was in&s;cribed the nature of the gift. The fir&s;t &s;upercargo received 450 tales in &s;ilver, the &s;econd 350, my&s;elf 250, the mate 75, and each com|mon &s;eamen 15; the whole amounting to about 2000 tales, or L. 800. This is an example worthy imitation, even where Chri&s;tianity is profe&s;&s;ed; though its tenets are often, on like occa&s;ions, &s;candalou&s;ly perverted."</Q> So far my author: and I add, that this bounty was undoubt|edly e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; for it has not the appear|ance of an occa&s;ional or &s;ingular act of benevolence. If &s;o, China is the only country in the world,
<PB N="213" REF="217">
where charity to &s;trangers in di&s;tre&s;s is a branch of public police.</P>
<P>Another advantage of a great &s;tate I mention with peculiar plea&s;ure, becau&s;e all who a&s;pire to be eminent in literature, are intere&s;ted in it. A &s;mall kingdom, like Denmark, like Sweden, like Portu|gal, cannot naturally be productive of good writers; becau&s;e where there are few readers, there is no &s;ufficient incitement to exert literary talents: a cla&s;|&s;ical work produced at pre&s;ent in the Celtic lan|guage, would be little le&s;s than a miracle. France is eminent above all other nations for the encou|ragement it affords to good writers: it is a popu|lous country; it is the chief &s;eat of ta&s;te, arts, and &s;ciences; and its language has become univer&s;al in Europe, being the court-language every where: what wonder then is it, that French writers carry the palm? But let not the Briti&s;h de&s;pond; for doth not a glorious pro&s;pect lie before them? The demand for Engli&s;h books in America is con&s;idera|ble; and is increa&s;ing daily. Population goes on vigorou&s;ly: the number of Briti&s;h already &s;ettled upon the river Ohio approach to 10,000; and the delicious country from that river down to the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, will be filled with people who&s;e native tongue is Engli&s;h. What rea&s;on is there to doubt, but that &s;o fine a climate and &s;o rich a &s;oil will be productive of readers in plenty? The pro|&s;pect of &s;o many readers, though in di&s;tant parts of the globe, mu&s;t rou&s;e our ambition; and our am|bition will be happily directed, if we lay a&s;ide all local di&s;tinctions, and a&s;pire to rival the French writers in real merit only.</P>
<P>But the foregoing advantages of a great &s;tate, however illu&s;trious, are &s;adly overbalanced by ma|nifold di&s;advantages. The fir&s;t is, the corruption of its kings, which, with a different view, is men|tioned in the &s;ketch immediately preceding. And
<PB N="214" REF="218">
be&s;ide corruption, there is another di&s;advantage that great monarchs are &s;ubjected to; which is, that being highly elevated above their &s;ubjects, they are acquainted with none but their mini&s;ters. And mini&s;ters, who, in a de&s;potic government, are &s;ub|ject to no controul but that of their ma&s;ter, com|monly prefer their own intere&s;t, without regard to his honour. Solyman Emperor of the Turks, tho' accompli&s;hed above any of his predece&s;&s;ors, could not e&s;cape the artifices of his wife Roxalana, and of his Vi&s;ir Ru&s;tan. They poi&s;oned his ears with re|peated calumnies again&s;t his elde&s;t &s;on Mu&s;tapha, a young prince of great hopes. They were not in hazard of detection, becau&s;e no per&s;on had acce&s;s to the Emperor but by their means. And the con|cluding &s;cene was an order from the Emperor to put his &s;on to death<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Robert&s;on's hi&s;tory of Charles V. where this incident is related with uncommon &s;pirit.</NOTE>. If a great monarch lies thus open in his own palace to the artifices of his mini&s;ters, his authority, we may be certain, will be very &s;light over the governors of his di&s;tant pro|vinces. Their power is precarious; and they op|pre&s;s the people without intermi&s;&s;ion, in order to ama&s;s wealth: the complaints of the people are di&s;|regarded; for they can never reach the throne. The Spani&s;h governors of the Philippine i&s;lands afford a deplorable in&s;tance of this ob&s;ervation. The heat of the climate promotes luxury: and luxury prompts avarice, which rages without controul, the di&s;tance of the capital removing all fear of de|tection. Arbitrary taxes are impo&s;ed on the peo|ple, and exce&s;&s;ive duties on goods imported, which are rigorou&s;ly exacted, and converted by the go|vernor to his own u&s;e. An arbitrary e&s;timate is made of what every field may produce; and the hu&s;bandman is &s;everely puni&s;hed if he &s;ail to deliver

the appointed quantity, whether his land has pro|duced it or not. Many thou&s;ands have abandoned their native country; and the few mi&s;erable wretches who remain, have taken refuge among inacce&s;&s;ible mountains.</P>
<P>The corruption of a court &s;preads through every member of the &s;tate. In an exten&s;ive kingdom, powerful above its neighbours, the &s;ubjects, having no occa&s;ion to exert them&s;elves in defence of their country, lo&s;e their manhood, and become cowards. At the &s;ame time, great inequality of rank and for|tune engender luxury, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and &s;en&s;uality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following pa&s;&s;age is from a late Ru&s;&s;ian wri|ter. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is a truth founded on experience, that com|merce poli&s;hes manners: but it is al&s;o a truth, that commerce, by exciting luxury, corrupts manners.

And thus agriculture and popu|lation dimini&s;h daily; than which nothing wor&s;e can befal a &s;tate."</Q></NOTE>. The fine arts, it is true, gain ground, manufac|tures are perfected, and courtly manners prevail: but every manly virtue is gone; and not a &s;oul to be found, who will venture his life to &s;ave his country. That di&s;ea&s;e is &s;preading in Britain; and the only circum&s;tance that guards France from equal pu&s;illanimity, is an e&s;tabli&s;hed mode, that every gentleman mu&s;t &s;erve &s;ome campaigns in the army.</P>
<P>A third di&s;advantage of an exten&s;ive monarchy is, that it is liable to internal convul&s;ions or revolu|tions,

occa&s;ioned commonly either by a &s;tanding army, or by the governors of di&s;tant provinces. With re&s;pect to the former, the government of a great kingdom, enervated by luxury, will always be military, and con&s;equently de&s;potic. A nume|rous army will &s;oon learn to contemn a pu&s;illani|mous leader, and to break loo&s;e from every tie of &s;ubjection: the &s;overeign is often changed at the caprice of the army; but de&s;poti&s;m continues in|variable. In Turky, Jani&s;aries dethrone the Sul|tan, without &s;cruple; but being &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly attached to the royal family, they confine them|&s;elves to it in electing a new Sultan. The Preto|rian bands were the Jani&s;&s;aries of the Roman empire, who never &s;crupled to dethrone the Em|peror on the &s;lighte&s;t di&s;obligation. But as there was no royal family, they commonly carried the crown to market, and be&s;towed it on the highe&s;t bidder. With re&s;pect to the latter, the governors of di&s;tant provinces, accu&s;tomed to act without controul, become fond of power, and put no bounds to ambition. Let them but gain the affec|tion of the people they govern, and boldne&s;s will do the re&s;t. The monarch is dethroned before he is prepared for defence, and the u&s;urper takes his place without oppo&s;ition. Succe&s;s commonly at|tends &s;uch undertakings; for the &s;overeign has no &s;oul, and the people have no patrioti&s;m. In Hin|do&s;tan, formerly, &s;ome di&s;contented favourite or &s;ouba took up arms to avenge fancied, or perhaps affected wrongs: venturing not however upon in|dependence, he &s;creened him&s;elf with &s;etting up &s;ome per&s;on of the royal blood, whom he proclaim|ed &s;overeign. The voluptuou&s;ne&s;s and effeminacy of the late kings of Per&s;ia have rendered that king|dom a prey to every bold invader. There perhaps never exi&s;ted a &s;tate that &s;o often has changed its ma&s;ter, as Per&s;ia has done of late years.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="221">
In the fourth place, a nation corrupted with luxury and &s;en&s;uality is a ready mor&s;el for every invader: to attempt the conque&s;t, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;ucceed, are almo&s;t the &s;ame. The potent A&s;&s;yrian monar|chy, having long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in peace without a &s;ingle enemy, &s;unk into &s;loth and effeminacy, and be|came an ea&s;y prey to the kings of Media and Ba|bylon. The&s;e two nations, in like circum&s;tances of &s;loth and effeminacy, were in their turn &s;wal|low'd up by Cyrus King of Per&s;ia. And the great empire of Per&s;ia, running the &s;ame cour&s;e, was &s;ubdued by Alexander of Macedon with a &s;mall army of thirty five thou&s;and men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Europe, neighbouring nations differ little in manners, or in fortitude.

Hence in A&s;ia perpetual conque&s;ts from north to &s;outh, to which even the great wall of China makes &s;carce any ob&s;tacle.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And this leads to a fifth di&s;advantage of a great empire, which is, the difficulty of guarding its frontiers. A kingdom, like an animal, becomes weak in proportion to its exce&s;s above a certain &s;ize. France and Spain would be le&s;s fitted for de|fence, were they enlarged beyond their pre&s;ent ex|tent: Spain in particular was a very weak kingdom, while it comprehended the Netherlands and the half of Italy. In their pre&s;ent &s;ize, forces are &s;oon collected to guard the mo&s;t di&s;tant frontiers. Months are required to a&s;&s;emble troops in an overgrown kingdom like Per&s;ia: if an army be defeated at the frontier, it mu&s;t di&s;per&s;e, fortified places being &s;el|dom within reach. The victor, advancing with celerity, lays &s;iege to the capital, before the pro|vincial troops can be formed into a regular army: the capital is taken, the empire di&s;&s;olved, and the
<PB N="218" REF="222">
conqueror at lei&s;ure di&s;putes the provinces with their governors. The Philippine i&s;lands made formerly a part of the exten&s;ive empire of China; but as they were too di&s;tant to be protected, or well governed, it &s;how'd con&s;ummate wi&s;dom in the Chine&s;e government to abandon them, with &s;everal other di&s;tant provinces.</P>
<P>A &s;mall &s;tate, on the other hand, is ea&s;ily guard|ed. The Greek republics thought them&s;elves &s;uf|ficiently fortified again&s;t the Great King, by their courage, their union, and their patrioti&s;m. The Spani&s;h Chri&s;tians, beat out of the open country by the Saracens, retired to the mountains of A&s;tu|ria, and elected Don Pelayo to be their King. That warlike prince walled none of his towns, nor did he fortify a &s;ingle pa&s;s; knowing, that while his people were brave, they would be invincible; and that walls and &s;trong-holds &s;erve but to abate courage. The Romans, while circum&s;cribed with|in Italy, never thought of any defence again&s;t an enemy but good troops. When they had acquired a va&s;t empire, even the Rhine appeared a barrier too weak: the numberle&s;s forts and legions that covered their frontiers could not defend them from a panic upon every motion of the barbarians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The u&s;e of cannon, which place the weak and &s;trong upon a level, is the only re&s;ource of the luxuri|ous and opulent again&s;t the poor and hardy.</NOTE>. A nation in which the reciprocal duties of &s;overeign and &s;ubject are con&s;cientiou&s;ly fulfilled, and in which the people love their country and their go|vernors, may be deemed invincible; provided due care be taken of the military branch. Every particular is rever&s;ed in a great empire: individuals gra&s;p at money, per fas aut nefas, to lavi&s;h it upon plea&s;ure: the governors of di&s;tant provinces tyran|nize without control, and, during the &s;hort period
<PB N="219" REF="223">
of their power, neglect no means, however op|pre&s;&s;ive, to ama&s;s wealth. Thus were the Roman provinces governed; and the people, who could not figure a greater tyrant than a Roman procon&s;ul, were ready to embrace every change. The Ro|mans accordingly were &s;en&s;ible, that to force their barrier, and to di&s;member their empire, were in effect the &s;ame. In our times the nations, who&s;e frontiers lie open, would make the mo&s;t re&s;olute &s;tand again&s;t an invader; witne&s;s the German &s;tates, and the Swi&s;s cantons. Italy enjoys the &s;tronge&s;t natural barrier of any country that is not an i&s;land; and yet for centuries has been a prey to every invader.</P>
<P>Two methods have been practi&s;ed for &s;ecuring the frontiers of an exten&s;ive empire: one is to lay the frontiers wa&s;te; the other is, to e&s;tabli&s;h feu|datory princes in the di&s;tant provinces. Sha Abbas, King of Per&s;ia, in order to prevent the inroads of the Turks, laid wa&s;te part of Armenia, carrying the inhabitants to I&s;pahan, and treating them with great humanity. Land is not much valued by the great monarchs of A&s;ia: it is precious in the &s;maller kingdoms of Europe, and the frontiers are com|monly guarded by fortified towns. The other frontiers of Per&s;ia are guarded by feudatory princes; and he &s;ame method is practi&s;ed in China, in Hin|do&s;tan, and in the Turki&s;h empire. The princes of Little Tartary, Moldavia, and Wallachia, have been long a &s;ecurity to the Grand Signior again&s;t his powerful neighbours in Europe.</P>

<P>The following incident is &s;till more intere&s;ting: it is of a late date; it happened among our countrymen; and will, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, make the deeper impre&s;&s;ion. The &s;cene of action was in Admiral Wat&s;on's &s;hip at the &s;iege of Chandernagore, where Captain Speke, and his &s;on, a youth of &s;ixteen, were both of them wound|ed by the &s;ame &s;hot. The hi&s;tory is related by Mr. Ives &s;urgeon of the &s;hip; which follows in his own words, only a little abridged. The Captain, who&s;e leg was hanging by the &s;kin, &s;aid to the Admiral, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In|deed, Sir, this was a cruel &s;hot, to knock down both father and &s;on."</Q> Mr. Wat&s;on's heart was too full for a reply; he only ordered both to be carried down to the &s;urgeon. The Captain, who was fir&s;t brought down, told me how dangerou&s;ly his Billy had been wounded. Pre&s;ently after the brave youth him&s;elf ap|peared, with his eyes overflowing with tears, not for him&s;elf but for his father. Upon my a&s;&s;urance that his father's wound was not dangerous, he became calm; but refu&s;ed to be touched, till his father's wound &s;hould be fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ed. Then pointing to a fellow s;ufferer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pray, Sir, dre&s;s al&s;o that poor man, who is groan|ing &s;o &s;adly be&s;ide me."</Q> I told him that the man had already been taken care of; and begged, that I now might have liberty to examine his wound. He &s;ubmitted: and calmly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I fear you mu&s;t amputate above the joint."</Q> I replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear, I mu&s;t."</Q> He cla&s;ped his hands together; and, lifting his eyes towards heaven, he offered up the following &s;hort but earne&s;t petition: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Good God! do thou on|able me to behave in my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances wor|thy of my father."</Q> He then told me he was all &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. I performed the operation above the joint of the knee; and during the whole time the intrepid youth never &s;poke a word, nor uttered a groan that could be heard at the di&s;tance of a yard. It is ea&s;ier to imagine than to expre&s;s the feelings of the father at this time: but whatever he felt, tears were the only expre&s;&s;ion. Both of them were carried to Calcutta: the father was lodged in the hou&s;e of his brother-in-law; and the &s;on was placed with me in the ho&s;pital. For the fir&s;t week I gave comfort to both, carrying good tidings to them of one another. But, alas! all the good &s;ymp|toms that had attended the young man began to di&s;|appear. The Captain perceived all in my countenance; and &s;o unwilling was he to add to my di&s;tre&s;s, as &s;el|dom to &s;peak about his &s;on. One time he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How long, my friend, do you think my Billy may remain in a &s;tate of uncertainty?"</Q> I replied, that if he &s;urvived the fifteenth day after the operation, there would be &s;trong hopes of his recovery. On the thir|teenth he died; and on the &s;ixteenth, the Captain, looking me &s;tedfa&s;tly in the face, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Well, Ives, how fares it with my boy?"</Q> Di&s;covering the truth from my &s;ilence, he cried bitterly, &s;queezed my hand, and begged me to leave him for one half-hour. When I returned, he appeared, as he ever after did, perfectly calm and &s;erene. The excellent youth had been deli|rious the evening before his death; and at two o'clock in the morning, he &s;ent me a note written with a pen|cil, of which the following is a copy. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Ives will con&s;ider the di&s;order a &s;on mu&s;t be in when he is dying, and is yet in doubt about his father.&mdash;If Mr. Ives is not too bu&s;y to honour this note, which nothing but the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s could draw from me&mdash;The boy waits an an&s;wer."</Q> I immedi|ately repaired to him; and he had &s;till &s;en&s;e enough to know me. He then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And is he dead?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Who, my dear?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My father, Sir."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No, my love; nor is he in any danger; he is almo&s;t well,"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I thank God: I am now &s;atisfied, and am ready to die."</Q> He had a locked jaw, and was in great pain, but I under&s;tood every word he uttered. He begged my pardon for having di&s;turbed me at &s;o early an hour; and before the day was ended, he &s;ur|rendered a life that de&s;erved to he immortal.&mdash;So far my author; and I only add, Does peace afford any &s;cene that can compare with this in moving our &s;ym|pathetic feelings?</P></NOTE>.

Indu&s;try, manufactures, and wealth, are the fruits of peace; but advert to what follows. Luxu|ry, a never-failing concomitant of wealth, is a &s;low poi&s;on, that debilitates the mind, and renders it in|capable of any manly exertion; courage, magnani|mity, heroi&s;m, come to be ranked among the miracles that are &s;uppo&s;ed never to have exi&s;ted but in fable; and the fa&s;hionable properties of &s;en&s;uali|ty, avarice, cunning, and di&s;&s;imulation, engro&s;s the mind. In a word, man by con&s;tant pro&s;perity and peace degenerates into a mean, impotent, and &s;elfi&s;h animal: more de&s;picable, if le&s;s odious, than an American &s;avage, who trea&s;ures up the &s;calps of his enemies as trophies of his prowe&s;s. Such are the fruits of perpetual peace with re&s;pect to indivi|duals.</P>
<P>Nor is the &s;tate it&s;elf le&s;s debilitated by itth an its members. Figure a man wallowing in riches, and immer&s;ed in &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, but dreading the in|&s;ection of a plague raging at his gate; or figure him in continual dread of an enemy, watching every opportunity to burn and de&s;troy. This man repre&s;ents a commercial &s;tate, that has long en|joyed peace, without di&s;turbance. A &s;tate that is a tempting object to an invader, without means of defence, is in a woful &s;ituation. The re|public of Venice was once famous for the wi&s;dom of its con&s;titution, and for being the Chri&s;tian bul|wark again&s;t the Turks; but by long peace it has become altogether effeminate. Its pre&s;ent princi|ples of government are conformable to its character. Every cau&s;e of quarrel with a neighbour is anxiou&s;|ly avoided; and di&s;turbances at home prevented by watchful &s;pies.

neighbours. Hannibal appeared upon the &s;tage too early: had the Romans, after their conque&s;t of Ita|ly, been &s;uffered to exchange their martial &s;pirit for luxury and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, they would have been no match for that great general. It was equally lucky for the Romans, that they came late upon Macedon. Had Alexander fini&s;hed his conque&s;t of Greece, and the Romans theirs of Italy, at the &s;ame period, they would probably have been con|fined each of them within their own limits. But A&s;iatic luxury and effeminacy, which had got hold of the Greeks and Macedonians before the Roman inva&s;ion, rendered them an ea&s;y prey to the invad|ders. It was the con&s;tant cry of Cato the Cen&s;or, <Q REND="inline">"Delenda e&s;t Carthago."</Q> Scipio Na&s;ica was a more able politician: his opinion was, to give peace to Carthage, that the dread of that once powerful republic might pre&s;erve in vigour the military &s;pi|rity of his country. What happened afterwards &s;ets the wi&s;dom of that advice in a con&s;picuous light. The battle of Actium, after a long train of cruel civil wars, gave peace to Rome under the Em|peror Augu&s;tus. Peace had not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted much above thirty years, when a Roman army, under Quintilius Varus, was cut to pieces in Germany. The con&s;ternation at Rome was great, as there was not a fortified town to prevent the Germans from pouring down upon Italy. In&s;tant orders were given for levying men; but &s;o effeminate had the Romans already become, that not a &s;ingle man would enli&s;t voluntarily. And Augu&s;tus was forced to u&s;e &s;evere mea&s;ures, before he could collect a very &s;mall army. How different the military &s;pirit of the Romans during the &s;econd Punic war, when &s;everal Roman armies were cut off, greater than that of Varus. The citizens who could bear arms were reduced to 137,000; and yet in the later years of that war, the Romans made &s;hift to keep

The Vandals, having expelled the Romans from Afric, enjoyed peace for a century without &s;eeing the face of an enemy. Procopius<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toria Vandalica, lib. 2.</NOTE> gives the fol|lowing account of them. Charmed with the fertili|ty of the &s;oil and benignity of the climate, they abandoned them&s;elves to luxury, &s;umptuous dre&s;s, high living, and frequent baths. They dwelt in the theatre and circus, amu&s;ing them&s;elves with dan|cers, pantomimes, and other gay entertainments: their villas were &s;plendid, and their gardens were adorned with water-works, beautiful trees, and odo|riferous flowers: no regard to cha&s;tity, nor to any manly virtue. In that effeminate condition, they made &s;carce any re&s;i&s;tance to Beli&s;arius with an ar|my far inferior to their own in number. The Sa|racens of A&s;ia, corrupted by pro&s;perity and opu|lence, were able to make no head again&s;t the Turks. About that time, the Spaniards, having by the &s;ame means become effeminate, were overpowered by the Saracens of Afric, who, remote from the cor|rupt manners of A&s;ia, retained their military &s;pirit. The wealth of the kingdom of Whida in Guinea, from fertility of &s;oil, great indu&s;try, and exten&s;ive commerce, produced luxury and effeminacy. The king, no le&s;s luxurious than his people, gave him|&s;elf up to &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, leaving government to his mini&s;ters. In that &s;ituation was Whidah in the year 1727, when the king of Dahomay, an inland &s;tate, reque&s;ted acce&s;s to the &s;ea for trade, offering to purcha&s;e the privilege with a yearly tribute. A haughty denial furni&s;hed a pretext for war. The king of Dahomay invaded the territories of his ene|my with a di&s;ciplined army, and pierced to the ca|pital without meeting any re&s;i&s;tance.

Whidah with his women had fled to an i&s;land, and his people were all di&s;per&s;ed. It amazed the con|queror, that a whole nation, without &s;triking a blow, had thus de&s;erted their wives, their children, their gods, their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and all that was dear to them. The Japane&s;e became warlike during long and bloody civil wars, which terminated, about the end of the &s;ixteenth century, in rendering their Emperor de&s;potic. From that period no opportuni|ty has occurred for exerci&s;ing their military &s;pirit, except in the education of their youth: heroi&s;m, with contempt of death, are inculcated; and the hi&s;tories of their illu&s;trious heroes are the only books that boys at &s;chool are taught to read. But the profound tranquillity that the empire now en|joys in a &s;trict and regular government, will in time render that warlike people effeminate and cow|ardly: human nature cannot re&s;i&s;t the poi&s;on of perpetual peace and &s;ecurity. In the war between the Turks and Venetians, anno 1715, the latter put great confidence in Napoli di Romania, a city in the Morea &s;trongly fortified, and provided with every nece&s;&s;ary for an ob&s;tinate defence. They had not the lea&s;t doubt of being able to draw their whole force together, before the Turks could make any progre&s;s in the &s;iege. But, to their a&s;toni&s;h|ment, the taking of that city, and of every other fortified place in the Morea, was the work of but a &s;ingle campaign. So much had the Venetians de|generated by long peace, from the courage and pa|trioti&s;m of their forefathers who conquered that country from the Turks. In &s;ome late accounts from China, we are told, that the King of Bengala or Bracma, having invaded Yunnan, an opulent province of China, obtained a complete victory over the Emperor's army, commanded by his &s;on-in-law; which &s;truck the inhabitants of that pro|vince with &s;uch a panic, that multitudes, for fear of

Our &s;ituation in an i&s;land, among &s;everal advantages, is &s;o far unlucky, that it puts us off our guard, and renders us negligent in pro|viding for defence: we never were invaded without being &s;ubdued<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ituation of the King of Sardinia, environed on all &s;ides with powerful monarchs, obliges him to act with the greate&s;t circum&s;pection; which circum&s;tance &s;eems to have formed the character of the princes of that hou&s;e.

<P>There is another advantage of war, which ought not to be overlooked, though not capital. It &s;erves to drain the country of idlers, few of whom are in|nocent, and many not a little mi&s;chievous. In the years 1759 and 1760, when we were at war with France, there were but twenty-nine criminals con|demned at the Old Bailey. In the years 1770 and 1771, when we were at peace with all the world, the criminals condemned there amounted to one hundred and fifty-one.</P>
<P>But though I declare again&s;t perpetual peace, perpetual war is &s;till more my aver&s;ion. The con|dition of Europe was deplorable in the dark ages, when va&s;&s;als a&s;&s;umed the privilege of waging war without con&s;ent of the &s;overeign. Deadly feuds, which prevailed univer&s;ally, threatened di&s;&s;olution of all government: the human race never were in a more woful condition. But anarchy never fails &s;oon or late to provide a cure again&s;t it&s;elf, which effeminacy, produced by long peace, never does. Revenge and cruelty, it is true, are the fruits of war; but &s;o are likewi&s;e firmne&s;s of mind and un|daunted courage; which are exerted with better will in behalf of virtue than of revenge. The cru|&s;ades were what fir&s;t gave a turn to the fierce man|ners of our ance&s;tors. A religious enterpri&s;e, which united numbers, formerly at variance, enlarged the &s;phere of &s;ocial affection, and &s;weetened the man|ners of Chri&s;tians to one another. The&s;e cru&s;ades filled Europe with heroes, who, at home, were ready for any new enterprize that promi&s;ed laurels. Moved with the oppre&s;&s;ive and mi&s;erable con&s;e|quences of deadly feuds, they joined in bonds of chivalry for &s;uccouring the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, for redre&s;&s;ing wrongs, and for protecting widows and orphans. Such heroi&s;m enflamed every one who was fond of glory and warlike atchievements. Chivalry was
<PB N="232" REF="236">
reli&s;hed by men of birth; and even kings were proud to be of the order. An in&s;titution, blending together valour, religion, and gallantry, was won|derfully agreeable to a martial people, and tended &s;trongly to improve their manners: humanity and gentlene&s;s could not but prevail in a &s;ociety, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it was, to &s;uccour every per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s. And as glory and honour were the only wi&s;hed-for recompence, chivalry was e&s;teemed the &s;chool of honour, of truth, and of fidelity. Thus, truth without di&s;gui&s;e, and a &s;crupulous adherence to pro|mi&s;es, became the di&s;tingui&s;hing virtues of a gen|tleman. It is true, that the enthu&s;ia&s;m of protect|ing widows and orphans, degenerated &s;ometimes in|to extravagance; witne&s;s knights who wandered about in que&s;t of adventures. But it would be un|fair to condemn the whole order, becau&s;e a few of their number were fooli&s;h. The true &s;pirit of chi|valry produced undoubtedly a &s;ignal reformation in the manners of Europe.

<HEAD>Ri&s;e and Fall of PATRIOTISM.</HEAD>
<P>THE members of a tribe, in their original &s;tate of hunting and fi&s;hing, being little united but by a common language, have no notion of a patria; and &s;carce any notion of &s;ociety, un|le&s;s when they join in an expedition again&s;t an ene|my, or again&s;t wild bea&s;ts. The &s;hepherd-&s;tate, where flocks and herds are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common, gives a clear notion of a common intere&s;t; but &s;till none of a patria. The &s;en&s;e of a patria begins to unfold it&s;elf, when a people leave off wandering, to &s;ettle upon a territory which they call their own. Agriculture connects them together; and govern|ment &s;till more: they become fellow-citizens; and the territory is termed the patria of every per&s;on born in it. It is &s;o ordered by Providence, that a man's country, and his countrymen, are to him in conjunction an object of a peculiar affection, term|ed amor patriae, or patrioti&s;m; an affection that ri&s;es high among a people intimately connected by regular government, by hu&s;bandry, by commerce, and by a common intere&s;t. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cari &s;unt parentes, cari liberi, propinqui, familiares; &s;ed omnes omnium caritates patria una complexa e&s;t: pro qua quis bonus dubitet mortem oppetere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Our parents are dear to us; &s;o are our chil|dren, our relations, and our friends: all the&s;e our country comprehends; and &s;hall we fear to die for our country?"</Q></NOTE>?"</Q></P>

Patrioti&s;m &s;tands at the head of &s;ocial affections; and &s;tands &s;o high in our e&s;teem, that no actions but what proceed from it are termed grand or heroic. When that affection appears &s;o agreeable in contemplation, how &s;weet, how elevating, mu&s;t it be in tho&s;e whom it in&s;pires! Like vigorous health, it beats con&s;tantly with an equal pul&s;e: like the ve&s;tal fire, it never is extin|gui&s;hed. No &s;ource of enjoyment is more plenti|ful than patrioti&s;m, where it is the ruling pa&s;&s;ion: it triumphs over every &s;elfi&s;h motive, and is a firm &s;upport to every virtue. In fact, wherever it pre|vails, the morals of the people are found to be pure and correct.</P>
<P>The&s;e are illu&s;trious effects of patrioti&s;m with re&s;pect to private happine&s;s and virtue; and yet its effects with re&s;pect to the public are &s;till more illu&s;|trious. A nation in no other period of its progre&s;s is &s;o flouri&s;hing, as when patrioti&s;m is the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of every member: during that period, it is invincible. Atheneus remarks, that the Athenians were the only people in the world, who, though clothed in purple, put formidable armies to flight at Marathon, Salamine, and Platea. But at that pe|riod patrioti&s;m was their ruling pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;ucce&s;s attended them in every undertaking. Where pa|trioti&s;m rules, men do wonders, whatever garb they wear. The fall of Saguntum is a grand &s;cene; a people exerting the utmo&s;t powers of nature, in de|fence of their country. The city was indeed de|&s;troyed; but the citizens were not &s;ubdued. The la&s;t effort of the remaining heroes was, to burn them&s;elves, with their wives and children, in one great funeral pile. Numantia affords a &s;cene not
<PB N="237" REF="241">
le&s;s grand. The citizens, &s;uch as were able to bear arms, did not exceed 8000; and yet braved all the efforts of 60,000 di&s;ciplined &s;oldiers commanded by Scipio Na&s;ica. So high was their character for in|trepidity, that even when but a few of them were left alive, the Romans dur&s;t not attempt to &s;torm the town. And they &s;tood firm till, &s;ubdued by fa|mine, they were no longer able to crawl. While the Portugue&s;e were eminent for patrioti&s;m, Lo|pez Caraico, one of their &s;ea-captains, in a &s;ingle &s;hip with but forty men, &s;tumbled upon the King of Achin's fleet of twenty gallies, as many junks, and a multitude of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. Re&s;olute to peri&s;h rather than yield, he maintained the fight for three days, till his &s;hip was pierced through and through with cannon-&s;hot, and not a &s;ingle man left un|wounded. And yet, after all, the King's fleet found it convenient to &s;heer off.</P>
<P>Patrioti&s;m at the &s;ame time is the great bulwark of civil liberty; equally abhorrent of de&s;poti&s;m on the one hand, and of licentiou&s;ne&s;s on the other. While the de&s;potic government of the Tudor fa|mily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, the Engli&s;h were too much depre&s;&s;ed to have any affection for their country. But when manufactures and commerce began to flouri&s;h in the latter end of Elizabeth's reign, a national &s;pirit broke forth, and patrioti&s;m made &s;ome figure. That change of di&s;po&s;ition was perhaps the chief cau&s;e, though not the mo&s;t vi&s;ible, of the national &s;trug|gles for liberty, which were frequent during the government of the Stewart family, and which end|ed in a free government at the Revolution.</P>
<P>Patrioti&s;m is too much cramped in a very &s;mall &s;tate, and too much relaxed in an exten&s;ive monar|chy. But that topic has already been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t &s;ketch of this book.</P>
<P>Patrioti&s;m is enflamed by a &s;truggle for liberty, by a civil war, by re&s;i&s;ting a potent invader, or by

any incident that forcibly draws the members of a &s;tate into &s;trict union for the common intere&s;t.

much heated, and continues full of motion. Pa|trioti&s;m made a capital figure among the Athenians, when they became a free people, after expelling the tyrant Pi&s;i&s;tratus. Every man exerted him&s;elf for his country: every man endeavoured to excell tho&s;e who went before him: and hence a Miltiades, an Ari&s;tides, a Themi&s;tocles, names that for ever will figure in the annals of time. While the Roman republic was confined within narrow bounds, au|&s;terity of manners, and di&s;intere&s;ted love to their country, formed the national character. The ele|vation of the Patricians above the Plebeians, a &s;ource of endle&s;s di&s;cord, was at la&s;t remedied by placing all the citizens upon a level. This &s;ignal revolution excited an animating emulation between the Patricians and Plebeians; the former, by he|roic actions, labouring to maintain their &s;uperiority; the latter &s;training every nerve to equal them: the republic never at any other period produced &s;o great men in the art of war.</P>
<P>But &s;uch variety there is human affairs, that tho' men are indebted to emulation for their heroic ac|tions, yet actions of that kind never fail to &s;uppre&s;s emulation in tho&s;e who follow. An ob&s;ervation is made above<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Book 1. Sketch 5. &sect; 1.</NOTE>, that nothing is more fatal to the progre&s;s of an art, than a per&s;on of &s;uperior genius, who damps emulation in others: witne&s;s the cele|brated Newton, to whom the decay of mathemati|cal knowledge in Britain is ju&s;tly attributed. The ob&s;ervation holds equally with re&s;pect to action. Tho&s;e actions only that flow from patrioti&s;m are deemed grand and heroic; and &s;uch actions, above all others, rou&s;e a national &s;pirit. But beware of a Newton in heroi&s;m: in&s;tead of exciting emulation, he will damp it: de&s;pair to equal the great men who are the admiration of all men, puts an end to emu|lation.

After the illu&s;trious atchievements of Mil|tiades, and after the eminent patrioti&s;m of Ari&s;tides, we hear no more in Greece of emulation or of pa|trioti&s;m. Pericles was a man of parts, but he &s;a|crificed Athens to his ambition.

Factious di&s;orders in a &s;tate never fail to relax it; for there the citizen is lo&s;t, and every per&s;on is beheld in the narrow view of a friend or an enemy. In the conte&s;ts between the Patricians and Plebeians of Rome, the public was totally di&s;regarded: the Plebeians could have no heart-affection for a country where they were op|pre&s;&s;ed; and the Patricians might be fond of their own order, but they could not &s;incerely love their country, while they were enemies to the bulk of their countrymen. Patrioti&s;m did not &s;hine forth in Rome, till all equally became citizens.</P>
<P>To &s;upport patrioti&s;m, it is nece&s;&s;ary that a peo|ple be in a train of pro&s;perity: when a nation be|comes &s;tationary, patrioti&s;m &s;ub&s;ides. The ancient Romans upon a &s;mall foundation erected a great empire; &s;o great indeed, that it fell to pieces by its unwieldine&s;s. But the plurality of nations, whe|ther from their &s;ituation, from the temper of their people, or from the nature of their government, are confined within narrower limits; beyond which their utmo&s;t exertions avail little, unle&s;s they hap|pen to be extraordinary favourites of fortune. When a nation becomes thus &s;tationary, its pu&s;hing genius is at an end: its plan is to pre&s;erve, not to acquire: the members, even without any example of heroi&s;m
<PB N="241" REF="245">
to damp emulation, are infected with the languid tone of the &s;tate: patrioti&s;m &s;ub&s;ides; and we hear no more of bold or heroic actions. The Venetians are a pregnant in&s;tance of the ob&s;ervation. Their trade with Aleppo and Alexandria did for centuries introduce into Europe the commodities of Syria, Egypt, Arabia, Per&s;ia, and India. The cities of Nuremberg and Aug&s;burgh in particular, were &s;up|plied from Venice with the&s;e commodities; and by that traffick became populous and opulent. Venice, in a word, was for centuries the capital trading town of Europe, and powerful above all its neighbours, both at &s;ea and land. A pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies by the Cape of Good Hope was indeed an animat|ing di&s;covery to the Portugue&s;e; but it did not en|title them to exclude the Venetians. The greater di&s;tance of Venice from the Cape, a trifle in it&s;elf, is more than balanced by its proximity to Greece, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and to the re&s;t of Italy. But the Portugue&s;e at that period were in the &s;pring of pro&s;perity; and patrioti&s;m envigorated them to make durable e&s;tabli&s;hments on the Indian coa&s;t, overpowering every nation that &s;tood in oppo|&s;ition. The Venetians, on the contrary, being a nation of merchants, and having been long &s;ucce&s;s|ful in commerce, were become &s;tationary, and un|qualified for bold adventures. Being cut out of their wonted commerce to India, and not having re&s;olution to carry on commerce in a new channel, they &s;unk under the good fortune of their rivals, and abandoned the trade altogether.</P>
<P>No cau&s;e hitherto mentioned hath &s;uch influence in depre&s;&s;ing patrioti&s;m, as inequality of rank and of riches in an opulent monarchy. A continual in|flux of wealth into the capital, generates &s;how, luxury, avarice, which are all &s;elfi&s;h vices; and &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s, en&s;laving the mind, eradicates every fibre
<PB N="242" REF="246">
of patrioti&s;m<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">France is not an exception. The French are vain of their country, becau&s;e they are vain of them&s;elves. But &s;uch vanity mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from patrioti&s;m, which con&s;i&s;ts in loving our country independent of our&s;elves.</NOTE>. A&s;iatic luxury, flowing into Rome in a plentiful &s;tream, produced an univer&s;al corrup|tion of manners, and metamorpho&s;ed into volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s the warlike genius of that great city. The dominions of Rome were now too exten&s;ive for a republican government, and its generals too power|ful to be di&s;intere&s;ted. Pa&s;&s;ion for glory wore out of fa&s;hion, as au&s;terity of manners had done for|merly: power and riches were now the only objects of ambition: virtue &s;eemed a farce; honour, a chimera; and fame, mere vanity: every Roman, abandoning him&s;elf to &s;en&s;uality, flattered him&s;elf, that he, more wi&s;e than his forefathers, was pur|&s;uing the cunning road to happine&s;s. Corruption and venality became general, and maintained their u&s;urpation in the provinces as well as in the capital, without ever lo&s;ing a foot of ground. Pyrrhus at|tempted by pre&s;ents to corrupt the Roman &s;enators, but made not the &s;lighte&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. Deplorable was the change of manners in the days of Jugurtha:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pity it is,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that no man is &s;o opulent as to purcha&s;e a people &s;o willing to be &s;old."</Q> Cicero, mentioning an oracle of Apollo, that Sparta would never be de&s;troyed but by avarice, ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves, that the prediction holds in every nation as well as in Sparta. The Greek empire, &s;unk in vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s without a remaining &s;park of patrio|ti&s;m, was no match for the Turks, enflamed with a new religion, that promi&s;ed paradi&s;e to tho&s;e who &s;hould die fighting for their prophet. How many nations, like tho&s;e mentioned, illu&s;trious formerly for vigour of mind, and love to their country, are

now &s;unk by contemptible vices as much below brutes as they ought to be elevated above them: brutes &s;eldom deviate from the perfection of their nature, men frequently.</P>
<P>Succe&s;sful commerce is not more advantageous by the wealth and power it immediately be&s;tows, than it is hurtful ultimately by introducing luxury and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, which eradicate patrioti&s;m. In the capital of a great monarchy, the poi&s;on of opu|lence is &s;udden; becau&s;e opulence there is &s;eldom acquired by reputable means: the poi&s;on of com|mercial opulence is &s;low, becau&s;e commerce &s;eldom enriches without indu&s;try, &s;agacity, and fair deal|ing. But by whatever means acquired, opulence never fails &s;oon or late to &s;mother patrioti&s;m under &s;en&s;uality and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. We learn from Plutarch and other writers, that the Athenians, who had long enjoyed the &s;un&s;hine of commerce, were extremely corrupt in the days of Philip, and of his &s;on Alex|ander. Even their chief patriot and orator, a pro|fe&s;&s;ed champion for independence, was not proof again&s;t bribes. While Alexander was pro&s;ecuting his conque&s;ts in India, Harpalus, to whom his im|men&s;e trea&s;ure was intru&s;ted, fled with the whole to Athens. Demo&s;thenes advi&s;ed his fellow-citizens to expell him, that they might not incur Alexander's di&s;plea&s;ure. Among other things of value, there was the King's cup of ma&s;&s;y gold, curiou&s;ly en|graved. Demo&s;thenes, &s;urveying it with a greedy eye, a&s;ked Harpalus what it weighed. To you, &s;aid Harpalus &s;miling, it &s;hall weigh twenty talents; and that every night he &s;ent privately to Demo&s;t|henes twenty talents with the cup. Demo&s;thenes next day came into the a&s;&s;embly with a cloth rolled about his neck; and his opinion being demanded about Harpalus, he made &s;igns that he had lo&s;t his voice. The Capuans, the Tarentines, and other Greek colonies in the lower parts of Italy, when
<PB N="244" REF="248">
invaded by the Romans, were no le&s;s degenerate than their brethren in Greece when invaded by Philip of Macedon; the &s;ame depravation of manners, the &s;ame luxury, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion for fea&s;ts and &s;pec|tacles, the &s;ame inte&s;tine &s;actions, the &s;ame indif|ference about their country, and the &s;ame contempt of its laws. The Portugue&s;e, enflamed with love to their country, when they di&s;covered a pa&s;&s;age to the Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, made great and important &s;ettlements in that very di&s;tant part of the globe; and of their immen&s;e commerce there is no parallel in any age or country. Prodi|gious riches in gold, precious &s;tones, &s;pices, per|fumes, drugs, and manufactures, were annually imported into Li&s;bon from their &s;ettlements on the coa&s;ts of Malabar and Coromandel, from the king|doms of Camboya, Decan, Malacca, Patana, Siam, China, &amp;c. from the i&s;lands of Ceylon, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Moluccas, and Japan: and to Li&s;bon all the nations in Europe re&s;orted for the&s;e valuable commodities. But the downfall of the Portugue&s;e was no le&s;s rapid than their exalta|tion; unbounded power and immen&s;e wealth hav|ing produced a total corruption of manners. If &s;incere piety, exalted courage, and indefatigable indu&s;try, made the original adventurers more than men; indolence, &s;en&s;uality, and effeminacy, ren|dered their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors le&s;s than women. Unhappy it was for them to be attacked at that critical time by the Dutch, who, in defence of liberty again&s;t the tyranny of Spain, were enflamed with love to their country, as the Portugue&s;e had been former|ly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While patrioti&s;m was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the Portugue&s;e, their illu&s;trious general Don Alphon&s;o d'Albuquerque carried all before him in the Indies. He adhered to the ancient frugality of his countrymen, and notwith&s;tanding his great power and wealth, remained uncorrupted. Tho' liberal in prai&s;ing his officers, he never preferred any who attempted to gain his favour by flattery. In private life he was of the &s;tricte&s;t ho|nour; but as ju&s;tice is little regarded between nations, it was no ob&s;truction to his ambitious views of extending the dominions of Portugal.</NOTE>. The Dutch, originally from their &s;ituation a
<PB N="245" REF="249">
temperate and indu&s;trious people, became heroes in the cau&s;e of liberty as ju&s;t now mentioned; and patrioti&s;m was their ruling pa&s;&s;ion. Pro&s;perous commerce &s;pread wealth through every corner; and yet &s;uch was the inherent virtue of that people, that their patrioti&s;m re&s;i&s;ted very long the contagion of wealth. But as appetite for riches increa&s;es with their quantity, patrioti&s;m &s;unk in proportion, till it was totally extingui&s;hed; and now the Dutch never think of their country, unle&s;s as &s;ub&s;ervient to private intere&s;t. With re&s;pect to the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company in particular, it was indebted for its pro&s;perity to the fidelity and &s;rugality of its &s;ervants, and to the patrioti&s;m of all. But the&s;e virtues were undermined, and at la&s;t eradicated, by luxury, which Europeans &s;eldom re&s;i&s;t in a hot climate. People go from Europe in the &s;ervice of the company, bent beforehand to make their for|tune per fas aut nefas; and their di&s;tance from their ma&s;ters renders every check abortive. The company, eat up by their &s;ervants, is rendered &s;o feeble, as to be incapable of maintaining their ground again&s;t any extraordinary &s;hock. A war of any continuance with the Indian potentates, or with the Engli&s;h company, would reduce them to bankruptcy. They are at pre&s;ent as ripe for being &s;wallowed up by any rival power, as the Portugue&s;e were formerly for being &s;wallowed up by them. Quaeritur, Is the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company in a

much better condition? Such is the ri&s;e and fall of patrioti&s;m among the nations mentioned; and &s;uch will be its ri&s;e and fall among all nations in like circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>It grieves me, that the epidemic di&s;tempers of luxury and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s are &s;preading wide in Britain. It is fruitle&s;s to di&s;&s;emble, that profligate manners mu&s;t in Britain be a con&s;equence of too great opu|lence, as they have been in every other part of the globe. Our late di&s;tractions leave no room for a doubt. Li&s;ten to a man of figure, thoroughly ac|quainted with every machination for court-prefer|ment. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Very little attachment is di&s;coverable in the body of our people to our excellent con&s;titu|tion: no reverence for the cu&s;toms nor for the opinions of our ance&s;tors; no attachment but to private intere&s;t, nor any zeal but for &s;elfi&s;h gra|tifications. While party-di&s;tinctions of Whig and Tory, high church and low church, court and country, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, the nation was indeed divided, but each &s;ide held an opinion, for which he would have hazarded every thing; for both acted from principle: if there were &s;ome who &s;ought to alter the con&s;titution, there were many who would have &s;pilt their blood to pre&s;erve it from violation: if divine hereditary right had its parti&s;ans, there were multitudes to &s;tand up for the &s;uperior &s;anctity of a title founded on an act of parliament, and the con&s;ent of a free peo|ple. But the abolition of party-names have de&s;troyed all public principles. The power of the crown was indeed never more vi&s;ibly exten|&s;ive over the great men of the nation; but then the&s;e men have lo&s;t their influence over the lower orders: even parliament has lo&s;t much of its authority; and the voice of the multitude is &s;ct up again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the legi&s;lature: an impo|veri&s;hed and heavily-burdened public, a people

<P>It is deplorable, that in Engli&s;h public &s;chools, patrioti&s;m makes no branch of education; young men, on the contrary, are trained up to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Keep what you get, and get what you can, is the chief le&s;&s;on inculcated at We&s;tmin&s;ter, Winche&s;ter, and Eaton. Students put them&s;elves in the way of receiving vails from &s;trangers; and that dirty prac|tice continues, tho' far more poi&s;onous to manners, than the giving vails to menial &s;ervants, which the nation is now a&s;hamed of. The Eaton &s;cholars are at times &s;ent to the highway to rob pa&s;&s;engers. The &s;trong without control tyrannize over the weak, &s;ubjecting them to every &s;ervile office, wip|ing &s;hoes not excepted. They are permitted to trick and deceive one another; and the fine&s;t fel|low is he who is the mo&s;t artful. Friend&s;hip in|deed is cultivated, but &s;uch as we find among rob|bers: a boy would be run down, if he had no a&s;&s;o|ciate. In a word, the mo&s;t determined &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is the capital le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>When a nation, formerly warlike and public|&s;pirited, is depre&s;&s;ed by luxury and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, doth nature afford no means for re&s;toring it to its former &s;tate? The Emperor Hadrian declared the Greeks a free people; not doubting, but that a change &s;o animating, would re&s;tore the fine arts to their pri&s;|tine

lu&s;tre.&mdash;A vain attempt: for the genius of the Greeks vani&s;hed with their patrioti&s;m; and liberty to them was no ble&s;&s;ing. With re&s;pect to the Por|tugue&s;e, the decay of their power and of their com|merce, have reduced them to a much lower con|dition, than when they ro&s;e as it were out of no|thing At that time they were poor, but innocent: at pre&s;ent they are poor, but corrupted with many vices. Their pride in particular &s;wells as high as when ma&s;ters of the Indies. The following ridicu|lous in&s;tance is a pregnant proof: &s;hoes and &s;tock|ings are prohibited to their Indian &s;ubjects; tho' many of them would pay hand&s;omely for the privi|lege. There is one obvious mea&s;ure for reviving the Portugue&s;e trade in India; but they have not &s;o much vigour of mind remaining, as even to think of execution. They &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s in that country, the town and territory of Goa, the town and ter|ritory of Diu, with &s;ome other ports, all admirably &s;ituated for trade. What &s;tands in the way but indolence merely, again&s;t declaring the places men|tioned free ports, with liberty of con&s;cience to traders of whatever religion? Free traders flocking there, under protection of the Portugue&s;e, would undermine the Dutch and Engli&s;h companies, which cannot trade upon an equal footing with private merchants; and by that means, the Por|tugue&s;e trade might again flouri&s;h. But that peo|ple are not yet brought &s;o low as to be compelled to change their manners, tho' reduced to depend on their neighbours even for common nece&s;&s;aries. The gold and diamonds of Bra&s;il are a plague that corrupt all. Spain and Portugal afford in&s;tructive political le&s;&s;ons: the latter has been ruined by opu|lence; the former, as will be &s;een afterward, by taxes no le&s;s impolitic than oppre&s;&s;ive. To enable the&s;e nations to recommence their former cour&s;e, or any nation in the &s;ame &s;ituation, I can di&s;cover

no means but pinching poverty. Commerce and manufactures taking wing, may leave a country in a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition: but a people may be very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and yet very vitious; for vices ge|nerated by opulence are not &s;oon eradicated. And tho' other vices &s;hould at la&s;t vani&s;h with the temp|tations that promoted them, indolence and pu&s;illa|nimity will remain for ever, unle&s;s by &s;ome power|ful cau&s;e the oppo&s;ite virtues be introduced. A very poor man, however indolent, will be tempted for bread to exert &s;ome activity; and he may be trained gradually from le&s;s to more by the &s;ame means. Activity at the &s;ame time produces bodily &s;trength; which will re&s;tore courage and boldne&s;s. By &s;uch means a nation may be put in motion with the &s;ame advantages it had originally; and its &s;e|cond progre&s;s may prove as &s;ucce&s;sful as the fir&s;t. Thus nations go round in a circle, from weakne&s;s to &s;trength, and from &s;trength to weakne&s;s. The fir&s;t part of the progre&s;s is verified in a thou&s;and in&s;tances; but the world has not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted long enough to afford any clear in&s;tance of the other.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e this &s;ketch with two illu&s;trious examples of patrioti&s;m; one ancient, one modern; one among the whites, and one among the blacks. Ari&s;tides the Athenian is famed above all the an|cients for love to his country. Its &s;afety and ho|nour were the only objects of his ambition; and his &s;ignal di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s made it the &s;ame to him, whether the&s;e ends were accompli&s;hed by him&s;elf or by others, by his friends or his foes. One con|&s;picuous in&s;tance occurred before the battle of Ma|rathon. Of the ten generals cho&s;en to command the Athenian army, he was one: but &s;en&s;ible that a divided command is &s;ubjected to manifold incon|veniencies, he exerted all his influence for delegat|ing the whole power to Miltiades; and at the &s;ame time zealou&s;ly &s;upported the propo&s;al of Miltiades,
<PB N="250" REF="254">
of boldly meeting the Per&s;ians in the field. His di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s was &s;till more con&s;picuous with re|gard to Themi&s;tocles, his bitter enemy. Su&s;pend|ing all enmity, he cordially agreed with him in every operation of the war; a&s;&s;i&s;ting him with his coun&s;el and credit, and yet &s;uffering him to engro&s;s all the honours of victory. In peace he was the &s;ame, yielding to Themi&s;tocles in the admini&s;tra|tion of government, and contenting him&s;elf with a &s;ubordinate place. In the &s;enate and in the a&s;&s;em|bly of the people, he made many propo&s;als in a borrowed name, to prevent envy and oppo&s;ition. He retired from public bu&s;ine&s;s in the latter part of his life; pa&s;&s;ing his time in training young men for &s;erving the &s;tate, in&s;tilling into them principles of honour and virtue, and in&s;piring them with love to their country. His death un&s;olded a &s;ignal proof of the contempt he had for riches; he who had been trea&s;urer of Greece during the lavi&s;hment of war, left not &s;ufficient to defray the expence of his funeral: a Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ary in like circum&s;tances acquires the riches of Croe&s;us.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of the other example is Fouli, a negro kingdom in Africa. Such regard is paid there to royal blood, that no man can &s;ucceed to the crown, but who is connected with the fir&s;t monarch, by an uninterrupted chain of females: a connection by males would give no &s;ecurity, as the women of that country are prone to gallantry. In the la&s;t cen|tury, the Prince of Sambaboa, the King's nephew by his &s;i&s;ter, was inve&s;ted with the dignity of Ka|malingo, a dignity appropriated to the pre&s;umptive heir. A liberal and generous mind, with undaunt|ed courage, rivetted him in the affections of the nobility and people. They rejoiced in the expec|tation of having him for their King. But their ex|pectation was bla&s;ted. The King, fond of his children, ventured a bold mea&s;ure, which was, to
<PB N="251" REF="255">
inve&s;t his elde&s;t &s;on with the dignity of Kamalingo, and to declare him heir to the crown. Tho' the Prince of Sambaboa had for him the laws of the kingdom, and the hearts of the people, yet he re|tired in &s;ilence to avoid a civil war. He could not however prevent men of rank from flocking to him; which the King interpreting to be a rebellion, rai&s;ed an army in order to put them all to the &s;word. As the King advanced, the Prince retired, re&s;olving not to draw his &s;word again&s;t an uncle, whom he was accu&s;tomed to call father. But finding that the command of the King's army was be&s;towed on his rival, he made ready for battle. The Prince obtained a complete victory: but his heart was not elated: the horrors of a civil war &s;tared him in the face: he bid farewell to his friends, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his army, and retired into a neighbouring kingdom; relying on the affections of the people to be placed on the throne after his uncle's death. During bani&s;hment, which continued thirty tedious years, frequent attempts upon his life put his temper to a &s;evere trial; for while he exi&s;ted, the King had no hopes that his &s;on would reign in peace. He had the fortitude to &s;tand every trial; when, in the year 1702, beginning to yield to age and misfortunes, his uncle died. His cou&s;in was depo&s;ed; and he was called by the unanimous voice of the nobles, to reign over a people who adored him.</P>

<P>IN the following &s;light e&s;&s;ay, intended for novices only, it is my &s;ole ambition to rival certain pains|taking authors, who teach hi&s;tory in the per&s;picuous mode of que&s;tion and an&s;wer. Among novices, it would be unpardonable to rank &s;uch of my fellow-citi|zens, as are ambitious of a &s;eat in parliament; many of whom &s;acrifice the inheritance of their ance&s;tors, for an opportunity to exert their patrioti&s;m in that au|gu&s;t a&s;&s;embly. Can &s;uch a &s;acrifice permit me to doubt, of their being adepts in the my&s;teries of government, and of taxes in particular? they ought at lea&s;t to be initiated in the&s;e my&s;teries.</P>
<P>It is of importance, that taxes, and their effects, be under&s;tood, not only by the members of our parliament, but al&s;o by their electors: a repre&s;entative will not readily vote for a de&s;tructive tax, when he cannot hope to di&s;gui&s;e his conduct. The intention of the pre&s;ent &s;ketch, is to unfold the principles upon which taxes ought to be founded, and to point out what are benefi|cial, what noxious. I have endeavoured to introduce &s;ome light into a &s;ubject involved in Egyptian darkne&s;s; and if that end be attained, I &s;hall die in the faith, that I have not been an unprofitable &s;ervant to my country.</P>

<HEAD>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS on TAXES.</HEAD>
<P>AS opulence is not friendly to &s;tudy and know|ledge, the men be&s;t qualified for being ge|nerals, admirals, judges, or mini&s;ters of &s;tate, are &s;eldom opulent; and to make &s;uch men &s;erve with|out pay, would be in effect to ea&s;e the rich at the expence of the poor. With re&s;pect to the military branch in particular, the bulk of tho&s;e who com|po&s;e an army, if withdrawn from daily labour, mu&s;t &s;tarve, unle&s;s the public, which they &s;erve, afford them maintenance. A republican government, during peace, may indeed be &s;upported at a very &s;mall charge among a temperate and patriotic peo|ple. In a monarchy, a public fund is indi&s;pen&s;able, even during peace: and in war it is indi&s;pen&s;able, whatever be the government. The Spartans car|ried all before them in Greece, but were forced to quit their hold, having no fund for a &s;tanding army; and the other Greek &s;tates were obliged to confederate with the Athenians, who after the Per|&s;ian
<PB N="254" REF="258">
war became ma&s;ters at &s;ea. A defect &s;o obvious in the Spartan government did a&s;&s;uredly not e&s;cape Lycurgus, the mo&s;t profound of all legi&s;lators. Fore&s;eeing that conque&s;t would be de&s;tructive to his countrymen, his &s;ole purpo&s;e was to guard them from being conquered; which in Sparta required no public fund, as all the citizens were equal, and equally bound to defend them&s;elves and their coun|try. A &s;tate, it is true, without a public fund, is ill qualified to oppo&s;e a &s;tanding army, regularly di&s;ciplined, and regularly paid. But in political matters, experience is our only &s;ure guide; and the hi&s;tory of nations, at that early period, was too barren to afford in&s;truction. Lycurgus may well be excu&s;ed, con&s;idering how little progre&s;s political knowledge had made in a much later period. Charles VII. of France was the fir&s;t in modern times who e&s;tabli&s;hed a fund for a &s;tanding army. Again&s;t that dangerous innovation, the crown-va&s;&s;als had no re&s;ource but to imitate their &s;overeign; and yet, without even dreaming of a re&s;ource, they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be undermined, and at la&s;t overturn|ed, by the King their &s;uperior. Thus, on the one hand, a nation, however warlike, that has not a public fund, is no match for a &s;tanding army enured to war. Exten&s;ive commerce, on the other hand, enables a nation to &s;upport a &s;tanding army; but, by introducing luxury, it eradicates manhood, and renders that army an unfit match for any poor and warlike invader. Hard may &s;eem the fate of nations, laid thus open to de&s;truction from every quarter. All that can be &s;aid is, that the Deity never in|tended to &s;tamp immortality upon any production of man.</P>
<P>The &s;tability of land fits it, above all other &s;ub|jects, for a public patrimony. But as crown-lands lie open to the rapacity of favourites, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, when the&s;e are di&s;&s;ipated, to introduce
<PB N="255" REF="259">
taxes; which have the following properties; that they unite in one common intere&s;t the &s;overeign and his &s;ubjects, and that they can be augmented or dimini&s;hed according to exigencies.</P>
<P>The art of levying money by taxes was &s;o little under&s;tood in the &s;ixteenth century, that after the famous battle of Pavia, in which the French King was made pri&s;oner, Charles V. was obliged to di&s;|band his victorious army, tho' con&s;i&s;ting but of 24,000 men, becau&s;e he had not the art to levy, in his exten&s;ive dominions, the &s;um that was nece&s;&s;ary to keep it on foot. So little knowledge was there in England of political arithmetic in the days of Edward III. that L. 1: 2: 4 on each pari&s;h was computed to be &s;ufficient for rai&s;ing a &s;ub&s;idy of L. 50,000. It being found, that there were but 8700 pari&s;hes, exclu&s;ive of Wales, the parliament, in order to rai&s;e the &s;aid &s;ub&s;idy, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on each pari&s;h L. 5, 16s.</P>
<P>In impo&s;ing taxes, ought not the expence of living to be deducted, leaving the remainder of a man's &s;tock as the only taxable &s;ubject? This method was adopted in the &s;tate of Athens. A rent of 500 mea&s;ures of corn, burdened the land|lord with the yearly contribution of a talent: a rent of 300, burdened him with half a talent: a rent of 200, burdened him with the &s;ixth part of a talent; and land under that rent paid no tax. Here the tax was not in proportion to the e&s;tate, but to what could be &s;pared out of it; or, in other words, in proportion to the ability of the proprietor. At the &s;ame time, ability mu&s;t not be e&s;timated by what a man actually &s;aves, which would exempt the pro|fu&s;e and profligate from paying taxes, but by what a man can pay who lives with oeconomy according to his rank. This rule is founded on the very na|ture of government: to tax a man's food, or the &s;ubject that affords him bare nece&s;&s;aries, is wor&s;e
<PB N="256" REF="260">
than the denying him protection: it &s;tarves him. Hence the following propo&s;ition may be laid down as the corner-&s;tone for taxation-buildiding, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That every man ought to contribute to the public revenue, not in proportion to his &s;ub|&s;tance,"</Q> but to his ability. I am &s;orry to ob|&s;erve, that this rule is little regarded in Briti&s;h taxes; though nothing would contribute more to &s;weeten the minds of the people, and to make them fond of their government, than a regulation fraught with &s;o much equity.</P>
<P>Taxes were long in u&s;e before it was di&s;covered that they could be made &s;ub&s;ervient to other pur|po&s;es be&s;ide that of &s;upporting government. In the fifteenth century, the &s;tates of Burgundy rejected with indignation a demand made by the Duke of a duty on &s;alt, though they found no other objection, but that it would oppre&s;s the poor people, who lived mo&s;tly on &s;alt meat and &s;alt fi&s;h. It did not occur to them, that &s;uch a tax might hurt their manufactures, by rai&s;ing the price of labour. A tax of two &s;hillings on every hearth, known by the name of hearth-money, was granted to Charles II. his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever. It was abrogated by an act of William and Mary, ann. 1688, on the following preamble. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it is not only a great oppre&s;&s;ion upon the poorer &s;ort, but a badge of &s;lavery upon the whole people, expo&s;ing every man's hou&s;e to be en|tered into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">d &s;earched at plea&s;ure by per&s;ons unknown to him."</Q> Had the harm done by &s;uch a tax to our manufactures been at that time under&s;tood, it would have been urged as the capi|tal rea&s;on again&s;t the tax. Our late improvements in commercial pol tics have unfolded an important doctrine, That taxes are &s;eldom indifferent to the public good; that frequently they are more oppre&s;|&s;ive
<PB N="257" REF="261">
to people, than beneficial to the &s;overeign; and, on the other hand, that they may be &s;o contrived, as to rival bounties in promoting in|du&s;try, manufactures, and commerce. The&s;e dif|ferent effects of taxes have rendered the &s;ubject not a little intricate.</P>
<P>It is an article of importance in government, to have it a&s;certained, what proportion of the annual income of a nation may be drawn from the peo|ple by taxes, without impoveri&s;hing them. An eighth part is held to be too much: hu&s;bandry, commerce, and population would &s;uffer. Dave|nant &s;ays, that the Dutch pay to the public an|nually the fourth part of the income of their country; and he adds, that their &s;trict oeconomy enables them to bear that immen&s;e load, with|out rai&s;ing the price of labour &s;o high as to cut them out of the foreign market. It was probably &s;o in the days of Davenant; but of late matters are much altered: the dearne&s;s of living and of labour has excluded all the Dutch manufactures from the foreign market. Till the French war in King William's reign, England paid in taxes but about a twentieth part of its annual income.</P>

<HEAD>POWER of IMPOSING TAXES.</HEAD>
<P>THAT to impo&s;e taxes belongs to the &s;ove|reign, and to him only, is undoubted. But it has been doubted, whether even king and par|liament, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;overeign authority in Britain, can legally impo&s;e a tax without con&s;ent of the people. The celebrated Locke, in his E&s;&s;ay on Government<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chap. 11. &sect; 140.</NOTE>, lays down the following propo&s;ition as fundamental. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'Tis true, govern|ments cannot be &s;upported without great charge, and 'tis fit every one who enjoys his &s;hare of protection &s;hould pay out of his e&s;tate his pro|portion for the maintenance of it. But &s;till it mu&s;t be with his own con&s;ent, i.e. the con|&s;ent of the majority, giving it, either by them|&s;elves, or their repre&s;entatives cho&s;en by them; for if any one &s;hall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the people by his own authority, and without &s;uch con&s;ent of the people, he thereby invades the fundamental law of property, and &s;ubverts the end of government. For what pro|perty have I in that which another may by right take, when he plea&s;es, to him&s;elf?"</Q> No author has reflected more honour on his native country, and on mankind, than Mr. Locke. Yet no name is above truth; and I am obliged to ob&s;erve, though with regret, that, in the foregoing rea&s;oning, the right of impo&s;ing taxes is laid upon a very crazy
<PB N="259" REF="263">
foundation. It may indeed be &s;aid, with &s;ome co|lour, that the freeholder, virtually impower their repre&s;entatives to tax them. But their va&s;&s;als and tenants, who have no vote in electing members of parliament, empower none to tax them: yet they are taxed like others; and &s;o are the va&s;&s;als and te|nants of peers. Add to the&s;e, an immen&s;e number of arti&s;ans, manufacturers, day-labourers, dome&s;|tics, &amp;c. &amp;c. with the whole female &s;ex; and it will appear, on calculation, that tho&s;e who are re|pre&s;ented in parliament make not the hundredth part of the taxable people. But further, it is acknowledged by our author, that the majority of the Lords and Commons mu&s;t bind the minority. This circum&s;tance alone might have convinced him of his error; for &s;urely the minority, in this ca&s;e, are bound without their con&s;ent; nay, again&s;t their con&s;ent. That a &s;tate cannot tax its &s;ubjects without their con&s;ent, is a ra&s;h propo&s;ition, to|tally &s;ubver&s;ive of government. Locke him&s;elf has &s;ugge&s;ted the &s;olid foundation of taxes, though inadvertently he lays no weight on it. I borrow his own words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That every one who enjoys his &s;hare of protection, &s;hould pay out of his e&s;tate his proportion for the maintenance of the govern|ment."</Q> The duties of &s;overeign and of &s;ubject are reciprocal; and common ju&s;tice requires, that a &s;ubject, or any per&s;on who is protected by a go|vernment, ought to pay for that protection. Simi|lar in&s;tances, without number, of &s;uch reciprocal duties, occur in the laws of every civilized nation. A man calls for meat and drink in a tavern: is he not bound to pay the bill, though he made no agreement beforehand? A man is wafted over a river in a ferry-boat: mu&s;t he not pay the common fare, though he made no promi&s;e? Nay, it is every man's intere&s;t to pay for protection: government cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a public fund;
<PB N="260" REF="264">
and what will become of individuals, when no longer protected, either in their per&s;ons or goods? Thus taxes are implied in the very nature of go|vernment; and the interpo&s;ition of &s;overeign au|thority is only nece&s;&s;ary &s;o determining the ex|pediency of a tax; and the quota, if found ex|pedient.</P>
<P>Many writers, mi&s;led by the re&s;pectable au|thority of Locke, boldly maintain, that a Briti&s;h parliament cannot legally tax the American colo|nies, who are not repre&s;ented in parliament. This propo&s;ition, which has drawn the attention of the public of late years, has led me to be more expli|cit on the power of impo&s;ing taxes, than otherwi&s;e would be nece&s;&s;ary. Tho&s;e who favour the inde|pendence of our colonies, urge, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a man ought to have the di&s;po&s;al of what he acquires by hone&s;t indu&s;try, &s;ubject to no control: whence the nece&s;&s;ity of a parliament for impo&s;ing taxes, where every individual is either per&s;onally pre|&s;ent, or by a repre&s;entative of his own election. The aid accordingly given to a Briti&s;h &s;overeign is not a tribute, but a free and voluntary gift."</Q> What is &s;aid above will bring the di&s;pute within a very narrow compa&s;s. If our coloni&s;ts be Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, which hitherto has not been controverted, they are &s;ubjected to the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature in every article of government; and as from the be|ginning they have been protected by Britain, they ought, like other &s;ubjects, to pay for that protec|tion. There never was a time le&s;s favourable to their claim of freedom from taxes, than the clo&s;e of the late war with France. Had Britain &s;ea&s;on|ably interpo&s;ed, they would have been &s;wallowed up by France, and become &s;laves to de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>If it be que&s;tioned, By what acts is a man un|der&s;tood to claim protection of government? I an|&s;wer, by &s;etting his foot on the territory. If, upon
<PB N="261" REF="265">
landing at Dover, a foreigner be robbed, the law interpo&s;es for him as for a native. And, as he is thus protected, he pays for protection, when he purcha&s;es a pair of &s;hoes, or a bottle of beer. The ca&s;e is clear with re&s;pect to a man who can chu&s;e the place of his re&s;idence. But what &s;hall be &s;aid of children, who are not capable of choice, nor of con&s;ent? They are protected, and protection implies the reciprocal duty of paying taxes. As &s;oon as a young man is capable of acting for him&s;elf, he is at liberty to chu&s;e other protectors, if tho&s;e who have hitherto protected him be not agreeable.</P>
<P>If a legal power to impo&s;e taxes without con&s;ent of the people did nece&s;&s;arily imply a legal power to impo&s;e taxes at plea&s;ure, without limitation, Locke's argument would be invincible, in a coun|try of freedom at lea&s;t. A power to impo&s;e taxes at plea&s;ure would indeed be an inva&s;ion of the fun|damental law of property; becau&s;e, under pretext of taxing, it would &s;ubject every man's property to the arbitrary will of the &s;overeign. But the argu|ment has no weight, where the &s;overeign's power is limited. The reciprocal duties between &s;overeign and &s;ubject imply, that the people ought to con|tribute what &s;ums are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of government, and that the &s;overeign ought not to demand more. It is true, that there is no regular check again&s;t him, when he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es his duty in this particular: but there is an effectual check in the nature of every government, that is not legally de&s;potic, viz. a general concert among all ranks, to vindicate their liberty again&s;t a cour&s;e of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion; and multiplied acts of that kind have more than once brought about &s;uch a concert.</P>
<P>As every member of the body-politic is under protection of the government, every one of them,
<PB N="262" REF="266">
as ob&s;erved above, ought to pay for being protect|ed; and yet this propo&s;ition has been controverted by an author of &s;ome note<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">L'Ami des Hommes.</NOTE>, who maintains, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the food and raiment furni&s;hed to the &s;ociety by hu&s;bandmen and manufacturers, are all that the&s;e good people are bound to con|tribute: and &s;uppo&s;ing them bound to contribute more, it is not till others have done as much for the public."</Q> At that rate, lawyers and phy&s;i|cians ought al&s;o to be exempted from contributing; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who draw the greate&s;t &s;ums, be|cau&s;e they are &s;uppo&s;ed to do the mo&s;t good. That argument, the &s;ugge&s;tion of a benevolent heart, is however no proof of an enlightened under&s;tanding. The labours of the farmer, of the lawyer, of the phy&s;ician, contribute not a mite to the public fund, nor tend to defray the expence of government. The luxurious proprietor of a great e&s;tate has &s;till a better title to be exempted than the hu&s;bandman, becau&s;e he is a great benefactor to the public, by giving bread to a variety of indu&s;trious people. In a word, every man ought to contribute for being protected; and if a hu&s;bandman be pro|tected in working for him&s;elf one-and-fifty weeks yearly, he ought thankfully to work one week more, for defraying the expence of that protection.</P>

<HEAD>DIFFERENT SORTS OF TAXES, with their Ad|vantages and Di&s;advantages.</HEAD>
<P>ALL taxes are laid upon per&s;ons; but in diffe|rent re&s;pects: a tax laid on a man per&s;onally, for him&s;elf and family, is termed a Capitation-tax; a tax laid on him for his property, is termed a Tax on goods. The latter is the only rational tax, be|cau&s;e it may be proportioned to the ability of the proprietor. It has only one inconvenience, that his debts mu&s;t be overlooked; becau&s;e, to take the&s;e into the account, would lead to endle&s;s intricacies. But there is an obvious remedy for that incon|venience: let the man who complains get quit of his debts, by &s;elling land or moveables; which will &s;o far relieve him of the tax. Nor ought this mea&s;ure to be con&s;idered as a hard&s;hip: it is &s;eldom the intere&s;t of a landholder to be in debt; and, with re&s;pect to the public, the mea&s;ure not only promotes the circulation of property, but is favourable to creditors, by procuring them pay|ment. A capitation-tax goes upon an erroneous principle, as if all men were of equal ability. What prompts it is, that many men, rich in bonds and other moveables, that can be ea&s;ily hid from public in&s;pection, cannot be reached otherwi&s;e than by a capitation-tax. But as, by the very &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;uch men cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ma&s;s of people, that mode of taxing, as mi&s;erably unequal, is rarely practi&s;ed among enlightened nations. Some years ago, a capitation-tax was impo&s;ed in Den|mark,
<PB N="264" REF="268">
obliging even day-labourers to pay for their wives and children. Upon the &s;ame ab&s;urd plan, a tax was impo&s;ed on marriage. One would be tempted to think, that population was intended to be di&s;couraged. The Dani&s;h government, how|ever, have been &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of &s;uch taxes; for a tax impo&s;ed on tho&s;e who obtain titles of honour from the crown, is applied for relieving hu&s;bandmen of their capitation-tax. But a tax of this kind lies open to many other objections. It cannot fail to rai&s;e the price of labour, a poi&s;onous effect in a country of indu&s;try; for the labourer will relieve him&s;elf of the tax, by heightening his wages: more prudent it would be to lay the tax di|rectly on the employer, which would remove the pretext for heightening wages. The taxing of day-labourers has be&s;ide an effect contrary to what is intended: in&s;tead of increa&s;ing the public reve|nue, it virtually le&s;&s;ens it, by rai&s;ing the pay of &s;oldiers, &s;ailors, and of every workman employed by government.</P>
<P>Taxes upon goods are of two kinds, viz. upon things con&s;umable, and upon things not con&s;um|able. I begin with the latter. The land-tax in Britain, paid by the proprietor according to an in|variable rule, and levied with very little expence, is, of all taxes, the mo&s;t ju&s;t, and the mo&s;t effectual. The proprietor, fore-knowing the &s;um he is &s;ub|jected to, prepares accordingly: and as each pro|prietor contributes in proportion to his e&s;tate, the tax makes no variation in their relative opulence. The only improvement it is &s;u&s;ceptible of is, the Athenian regulation, of exempting &s;mall e&s;tates, that are no more than &s;ufficient to afford bread to the frugal proprietor. In France, the land-tax &s;eems to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed on a very fal&s;e foun|dation, viz. That the clergy perform their duty to the &s;tate, by praying and in&s;tructing; that the
<PB N="265" REF="269">
noble&s;&s;e fight for the &s;tate; and, con&s;equently, that the only duty left to the farmer is, to de&s;ray the charges of government. This argument would hold, if the clergy were not paid for praying, and the noble&s;&s;e for fighting. Such a load upon the poore&s;t members of the &s;tate is an ab&s;urdity in po|litics. And, to render it &s;till more ab&s;urd, the tax on the farmer is not impo&s;ed by an invariable rule: every one is taxed in proportion to his apparent circum&s;tances, which, in effect, is to tax indu&s;try. Nor is this all: Under pretext of preventing fa|mine, the exporting of corn, even from province to province, is &s;requently interrupted; by which it happens, that the corn of a plentiful year is de&s;troyed by in&s;ects, and in a year of &s;carcity is engro&s;&s;ed by merchants. Suppo&s;e a plan were reque&s;ted for di&s;couraging agriculture, here is one actually put in execution, the &s;ucce&s;s of which is infallible. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Were it related,"</Q> ob&s;erves a French writer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in &s;ome foreign hi&s;tory, that there is a country ex|tremely fertile, in a fine climate, enjoying navi|gable rivers, with every advantage for the commerce of corn; and yet that the product is not &s;ufficient for the inhabitants: would not one conclude the people to be &s;tupid and barba|rous? This, however, is the ca&s;e of France."</Q> He adds the true rea&s;on, which is, the di&s;cou|ragement hu&s;bandry lies under by oppre&s;&s;ive taxes. We have Diodorus Siculus for our autho|rity, that the hu&s;bandman was greatly re&s;pected in Hindo&s;tan. Among other nations, &s;ays he, the land, during war, lies untilled; but in Hindo&s;tan, hu&s;bandmen are &s;acred, and no &s;oldier ventures to lay a hand on them. They are con&s;idered as &s;ervants of the public, who cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>It is a gro&s;s error to maintain, that a tax on land is the &s;ame with a tax on the product of land.
<PB N="266" REF="270">
The former, which is the Engli&s;h mode, is no di&s;couragement to indu&s;try and improvements: on the contrary, the higher the value of land is rai&s;ed, the le&s;s will the tax be in proportion. The latter, which is the French mode, is a great di&s;couragement to indu&s;try and improvements; be|cau&s;e the more a man improves, the deeper he is taxed. The tenth part of the product of land is the only tax that is paid in China. This tax, of the &s;ame nature with our tithes paid to the clergy, yields to the Briti&s;h mode of taxing the land it&s;elf, and not its product; but is le&s;s excep|tionable than the land-tax in France, becau&s;e it is not arbitrary. The Chine&s;e tax, paid in kind, is &s;tored in magazines, and &s;old from time to time for maintaining the magi&s;trates and the army, the &s;urplus being remitted to the trea&s;ury. In ca&s;e of famine, it is &s;old to the poor people at a moderate price. In Tonquin there is a land-tax, which, like that in France, is laid upon pea&s;ants, exempting people of condition, and the literati in particular. Many grounds that bear not corn contribute hay for the king's elephants and cavalry; which the poor pea&s;ants are obliged to carry to the capital, even from the greate&s;t di&s;tance; a regulation no le&s;s &s;lavi&s;h than impolitic.</P>
<P>The window-tax, the coach-tax, and the plate-tax come under the pre&s;ent head, being taxes upon things not con&s;umable. In Holland there is a tax on dome&s;tic &s;ervants, which de&s;erves well to be imitated. Var<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty in Britain, and love of &s;how, have multiplied dome&s;tics, far beyond nece&s;&s;ity, and even beyond convenience. A number of idlers collected in a luxurious family, become vitious and debauched; and many useful hands are withdrawn from hu&s;bandry and manufactures. In order that the tax may reach none but the vain and &s;plen|did, tho&s;e who have but one &s;ervant pay no|thing:
<PB N="267" REF="271">
two dome&s;tics &s;ubject the ma&s;ter to five &s;hillings for each, three to ten &s;hillings for each, four to twenty &s;hillings, five to forty &s;hillings, and &s;o on, in a geometrical progre&s;&s;ion. In Denmark, a farmer is taxed for every plough he u&s;es. If the tax be intended for di&s;couraging exten&s;ive farms, it is a happy contrivance, agreeable to &s;ound poli|tics; for &s;mall farms tend not only to population, but to rear a temperate and robu&s;t &s;pecies of men, fit for every &s;ort of labour.</P>
<P>Next of taxes upon things con&s;umable. The taxes that appear the lea&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive, becau&s;e di&s;|gui&s;ed, are what are laid on our manufactures: the tax is advanced by the manufacturer, and drawn from the purcha&s;er as part of the price. In Rome, a tax was laid upon every man who purcha&s;ed a &s;lave. It is reported by &s;ome authors, that the tax was remitted by the Emperor Nero; and yet no alteration was made, but to oblige the vender to advance the tax. Hear Tacitus on that &s;ubject<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Annal. lib. 13.</NOTE>: <Q>Vectigal quintae et vice&s;imae venalium mancipiorum remi&s;&s;um, &s;pecie magis quam vi; quia cum venditor pendere juberetur, in partem pretii emptoribus accre&s;cebat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The tax of a twenty-fifth upon &s;laves to be &s;old was remitted more in appearance than in reality; be|cau&s;e when the &s;eller was ordered to pay it, he laid it upon the price to the buyer."</Q></NOTE>."</Q> Thus, with re&s;pect to our taxes on &s;oap, &s;hoes, candles, and other things con&s;umable, the purcha&s;er thinks he is only paying the price, and never dreams that he is paying a tax. To &s;upport the illu&s;ion, the duly ought to be moderate: to impo&s;e a tax twenty times the value of the commodity, as done in France with re&s;pect to &s;alt, rai&s;es more di&s;gu&s;t in the people, as an attempt to deceive them, than
<PB N="268" REF="272">
when laid on without di&s;gui&s;e. Such exorbitant taxes, which are paid with the utmo&s;t reluctance, cannot be made effectual, but by &s;evere penalties, equal to what are inflicted on the mo&s;t atrocious criminals; which has a bad effect with re&s;pect to morals, as it tends to le&s;&s;en the horror one naturally conceives at great crimes.</P>
<P>Such taxes are attended with another &s;ignal ad|vantage: they bear a &s;trict proportion to the abi|lity of the contributors, the opulent being com|monly the greate&s;t con&s;umers. The taxes on coaches and on plate are paid by men of fortune, without loading the indu&s;trious poor; and on that account are highly to be prai&s;ed: being impo&s;ed, however, without di&s;gui&s;e, they are paid with more reluctance by the rich, than taxes on con|&s;umption are by the poor.</P>
<P>I add one other advantage of taxes on con|&s;umption. They are finely contrived to connect the intere&s;t of the &s;overeign with that of his &s;ub|jects; for his profit ari&s;es from their pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Such are the advantages of a tax on con&s;ump|tion; but it mu&s;t not be prai&s;ed, as attended with no inconvenience The retailer, under pretext of the tax, rai&s;es the price higher than barely to in|demnify him&s;elf; by which means the tax is com|monly doubled upon the con&s;umer. The incon|venience, however, is but temporary. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Such ex|tortion,"</Q> &s;ays Davenant, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"cannot la&s;t long; for every commodity in common u&s;e finds in the market its true value and price."</Q></P>
<P>There is another inconvenience much more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing becau&s;e it admits not a remedy, and becau&s;e it affects the &s;tate it&s;elf. Taxes on con|&s;umption, being commonly laid on things of the greate&s;t u&s;e, rai&s;e a great &s;um to the public, with|out much burdening individuals; the duty on coal,
<PB N="269" REF="273">
for example, on candle, on leather, on &s;oap, on &s;alt, on malt, and on malt-liquor. The&s;e duties, however, carry in their bo&s;om a &s;low poi&s;on, by rai&s;ing the price of labour and of manufactures. De Wit ob&s;erves, that the Dutch taxes upon con|&s;umption have rai&s;ed the price of their broad cloth forty per cent. and our manufactures, by the &s;ame means, are rai&s;ed at lea&s;t thirty per cent. Britain has long laboured under this chronical di&s;temper, which, by excluding her from foreign markets, will not only put an end to her own manufac|tures, but will open a wide door to the foreign, as &s;muggling cannot be prevented, where commo|dities imported are much cheaper than our own.</P>
<P>Nor ought it to be overlooked, that taxes on con&s;umption are not equally proper in every &s;itu|ation. They are proper in a populous country, like Holland; becau&s;e the expence of collecting is but a trifle, compared with the &s;ums collected. But in a country thinly peopled, &s;uch taxes are improper; becau&s;e the expence of collecting makes too great a proportion of the &s;ums collected: in the Highlands of Scotland, the exci&s;e on ale and &s;pirits defrays not the expence of levying; the people are burdened, and the government is not &s;upported.</P>
<P>A lottery is a &s;ort of tax different from any that have been mentioned. It is a tax of all the mo&s;t agreeable, being entirely voluntary. An ap|petite for gaming, inherent even in &s;avages, prompts multitudes to venture their money, in hopes of the highe&s;t prize; though they cannot altogether hide from them&s;elves the inequality of the play. But lucky it is, that the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions of men can be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the public good Lotteries, how|ever, produce one unhappy effect: they blunt the edge of indu&s;try, by directing the attention to a more

compendious method of gain. At the &s;ame time, the money acquired by a lottery &s;eldom turns to ac|count; for what comes without trouble goes com|monly without thought.</P>

<HEAD>MANNER OF LEVYING TAXES.</HEAD>
<P>TO avoid the rapacity of farmers, a mild go|vernment will, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, prefer ma|nagement; i.e. it will levy taxes by officers ap|pointed for that purpo&s;e. Monte&s;quieu<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">L'E&s;prit des Loix, liv. 13. chap. 19.</NOTE> has handled that point with his u&s;ual &s;prightly ele|gance.</P>
<P>Importation-duties are commonly laid upon the importer before the cargo is landed, leaving him to add the duty to the price of goods; and facility of levying is the motive for preferring that method. But is it not hard, that the importer &s;hould be ob|liged to advance a great &s;um in the name of duty, before drawing a &s;hilling by the &s;ale of his goods? It is not only hard, but gro&s;sly unju&s;t: for if the goods peri&s;h without being &s;old, the duty is lo&s;t to the importer; he has no claim again&s;t the public for re&s;titution. This has more the air of de&s;poti&s;m than of a free government. Would it not be more equitable, that goods &s;hould be lodged in a public warehou&s;e, under cu&s;tody of revenue-offcers, the importer paying the duty as the goods are &s;old? By the pre&s;ent method, the duty remains
<PB N="271" REF="275">
with the collector three years, in order to be re|paid to the importer, if the goods be experted within that time: but, by the method propo&s;|ed, the duty would be paid to the trea&s;ury as the goods are &s;old, which might be within a month from the time of importation, perhaps a week; and the trea&s;ury would profit, as well as the fair trader. There are public ware-hou&s;es ad|joining to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e of Bourdeaux, where the &s;ugars of the French colonies are depo&s;ited, till the importer finds a market; and he pays the duty gradually, as &s;ales are made. It re|joices me, that the &s;ame method is practi&s;ed in this i&s;land, with re&s;pect to &s;ome foreign articles nece&s;&s;ary in our trade with Africa: the duty is not demanded till the goods are &s;hipped for that continent. It is al&s;o put in practice with re&s;pect to foreign &s;alt, and with re&s;pect to rum imported from our &s;ugar-colonies.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the equity of what is here propo&s;ed, which relieves the importer from advance of mo|ney, and from ri&s;k, many other advantages would be derived from it. In the fir&s;t place, the mer|chant, having no occa&s;ion to re&s;erve any portion of his capital for an&s;wering the duty, would be enabled to commence trade with a &s;mall &s;tock, or to encrea&s;e his trade, if his &s;tock be large: trade would flouri&s;h, and the public revenue would encrea&s;e in proportion. Secondly, It would le&s;&s;en &s;muggling. Many a one who commences trade with upright intention, is tempted to &s;muggle for want of ready money to pay the duty. Third|ly, This manner of levying the duty would not only abridge the number of officers, but remove every pretext for claiming di&s;count on pre&s;ence of leakage, &s;amples, and the drying or &s;hrinking of goods. In the pre&s;ent manner of levying, that
<PB N="272" REF="276">
di&s;count mu&s;t be left to the di&s;cretion of the offi|cer: a private under&s;tanding is thus introduced be|tween him and the merchant, hurtful to the re|venue, and de&s;tructive to morals. Fourthly, the merchant would be enabled to lower his prices, and be forced to lower them, by having many rivals; which, at the &s;ame time, would give ac|ce&s;s to augment importation-duties, without rai&s;|ing the price of foreign commodities above what it is at pre&s;ent. But the capital advantage of all would be, to render, in effect, every port in Bri|tain a free port, enabling Engli&s;h merchants, many of whom have great capitals, to out&s;trip foreigners in what is termed A COMMERCE OF SPECU|LATION. This i&s;land is well &s;ituated for &s;uch commerce; and were our ports free, the produc|tions of all climates would be &s;tored up in them, ready for exportation, when a market offers; an excellent plan for encrea&s;ing our &s;hipping, and for producing boundle&s;s wealth.</P>

<HEAD>RULES TO BE OBSERVED in TAXING.</HEAD>
<P>THE different objects of taxes, and the intrica|cy thereby occa&s;ioned, require general rules, not only for directing the legi&s;lature in impo&s;ing them, but for enabling others to judge what are beneficial, and what hurtful.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rule I &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t is. That wherever there is an opportunity of &s;muggling, taxes ought to be moderate; for &s;muggling can never effectu|ally be re&s;trained, where the cheapne&s;s of imported goods is in effect an en&s;urance again&s;t the ri&s;k; in which view, Swift humorou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that two and two do not always make four. A duty of 15 per cent. upon printed linen imported into France, encourages &s;muggling: a lower duty would produce a greater &s;um to the public, and be more beneficial to the French manufacturer. Bone-lace imported into France is charged with a duty of 20 per cent in order to favour that manufacture at home: but in vain; for bone-lace is ea&s;ily &s;muggled, and the price is little higher than before. The high duty on <Q REND="inline">"&s;uccus liquoritiae"</Q> imported into Britain, be|ing L. 7: 2: 6 per hundred weight, was a great encouragement to &s;muggling; for which rea&s;on it is reduced to 30s. per hundred weight<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">7^0 Geo. III. cap. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;muggling of tea, which extracts great &s;ums from Britain, is much encouraged by its high price at home. As far as I can judge, it would be profi|table, both to the public and to individuals, to lay
<PB N="274" REF="278">
a&s;ide the importation-duty, and to &s;ub&s;titute in its &s;tead a duty on the con&s;umer. Freedom of impor|tation would enable the Ea&s;t-India company to &s;ell &s;o cheap, as effectually to bani&s;h &s;muggling; and the low price of tea would enable the con&s;umer to pay a pretty &s;mart duty, without being much out of pocket. The following mode is propo&s;ed merely as an example: it is a hint that may lead to im|provements. Let every man who u&s;es tea be &s;ub|jected to a moderate tax, proportioned to his mode of living. Ab&s;olute preci&s;ion cannot be expected in proportioning the tax on families; but gro&s;s ine|quality may ea&s;ily be prevented. For in&s;tance, let the mode of living be determined by the equipage that is kept. A coach or chai&s;e with two hor&s;es &s;hall &s;ubject a family to a yearly tax of L. 10, heightening the tax in proportion to the number of hor&s;es and carriages; two &s;ervants in livery, with|out a carriage, to a tax of 40s. ; every other family paying 20s. Every family where tea is u&s;ed mu&s;t be entered in the collector's books, with its mode of living, under a heavy penalty; which would regulate the coach-tax, as well as that on tea. Such a tax, little expen&s;ive in levying, would undoubtedly be effectual: a ma&s;ter of a family is imprudent indeed, if he puts it in the power of the vender, of a malicious neighbour, or of a menial &s;ervant, to &s;ubject him to a heavy penalty. This tax at the &s;ame time would be the lea&s;t di&s;agreeable of any that is levied without di&s;gui&s;e; being in effect a voluntary tax, as the mode of living is voluntary. Nor would it be difficult to temper the tax, &s;o as to afford a greater &s;um to the public than it receives at pre&s;ent from the importation-duty, and yet to co&s;t our people no more for tea than they pay at pre&s;ent, taking into computation the high price of that commodity.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="279">
High duties on importation are immoral, as well as impolitic; and it would be unju&s;tifiable in the legi&s;lature, fir&s;t to tempt, and then to puni&s;h for yielding to the temptation.</P>
<P>A &s;econd rule is, That taxes expen&s;ive in the levying ought to be avoided; being heavy on the people, without a proportional benefit to the re|venue. Our land-tax is admirable: it affords a great &s;um, levied with very little expence. The duties on coaches, and on gold and &s;ilver plate, are &s;imilar; and &s;o would be the tax on tea above pro|po&s;ed. The taxes that are the mo&s;t hurtful to trade and manufactures, &s;uch as the duty on &s;oap, candle, leather, are expen&s;ive in levying.</P>
<P>A third rule is, To avoid arbitrary taxes. They are di&s;gu&s;tful to all, not excepting tho&s;e who are favourably treated; becau&s;e &s;elf-partiality &s;eldom permits a man to think, that ju&s;tice is done him in &s;uch matters. A tax laid on per&s;ons in proportion to their trade, or their opulence, mu&s;t be arbitrary, even where &s;trict ju&s;tice is intended; becau&s;e it depends on the vague opinion or conjecture of the collector: every man thinks him&s;elf injured; and the &s;um levied does not balance the di&s;content it occa&s;ions. The tax laid on the French farmer in proportion to his &s;ub&s;tance, is an intolerable grie|vance, and a great engine of oppre&s;&s;ion: if the farmer exerts any activity in melicrating his land, he is &s;ure to be doubly taxed. Hamburgh affords the only in&s;tance of a tax on trade and riches, that is willingly paid, and that con&s;equently is levied without oppre&s;&s;ion. Every merchant puts private|ly into the public che&s;t, the &s;um that in his own opinion he ought to contribute: A &s;ingular exam|ple of integrity in a great trading town; for there is no &s;u&s;picion of wrong in that tacit contribution. But this &s;tate is not yet corrupted by luxury.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="280">
Becau&s;e many vices that poi&s;on a nation ari&s;e from inequality of riches, I propo&s;e it as a fourth rule, to remedy that inequality as much as po&s;&s;ible, by relieving the poor, and burdening the rich. Proprietors of overgrown e&s;tates can bear without inconvenience very heavy taxes; and tho&s;e e&s;peci|ally who convert much land from profit to plea&s;ure, ought not to be &s;pared. Would it not contribute greatly to the public good, that a tax of L. 50 &s;hould be laid on every hou&s;e that has 50 windows; L. 150 on hou&s;es of 100 windows; and L. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">00 on hou&s;es of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">00 windows? By the &s;ame principle, every deer-park of 200 acres ought to pay L. 50; of 500 acres L. 200; and of 1000 acres L. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">00. Fifty acres of plea&s;ure ground to pay L. 30; 100 &s;uch acres L. 80; 150 acres L. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">0; and 200 acres L. 300. Such a tax would have another good effect: it would probably move high minded men to leave out more ground for maintenance of the poor, than they are commonly inclined to do.</P>
<P>A fifth rule of capital importance, as it regards the intere&s;t of the &s;tate in general, is, That every tax which tends to impoveri&s;h the nation ought to be rejected with indignation. Such taxes contra|dict the very nature of government, which is to protect, not to oppre&s;s. And &s;uppo&s;ing the intere&s;t of the governing power to be only regarded, a &s;tate is not mea&s;ured by the extent of its territory, but by what the &s;ubjects are able to pay annually with|out end. A &s;overeign, however regardle&s;s of his duty as father of his people, will regard that rule for his own &s;ake: a nation impoveri&s;hed by oppre&s;|&s;ive taxes will reduce the &s;overeign at la&s;t to the &s;ame poverty; for he cannot levy what they cannot pay.</P>
<P>Whether taxes impo&s;ed on common nece&s;&s;aries, which fall heavy upon the labouring poor, be of the kind now mentioned, de&s;erves the mo&s;t &s;erious
<PB N="277" REF="281">
con&s;ideration. Where they tend to promote indu&s;|try, they are highly &s;alutary: where they deprive us of foreign markets, by rai&s;ing the price of la|bour, and of manufactures, they are highly noxio|ous. In &s;ome ca&s;es, indu&s;try may be promoted by taxes, without rai&s;ing the price of labour and of manufactures. Tobol&s;ki in Siberia is a populous town, the price of vivres is extremely low, and the people on that account are extremely idle. While they are ma&s;ters of a farthing, they work none: when they are pinched with hunger, they gain in a day what maintains them a week: they never think of to-morrow, nor of providing again&s;t want. A tax there upon nece&s;&s;aries would probably excite &s;ome degree of indu&s;try. Such a tax, renewed from time to time, and augmented gradually, would promote indu&s;try more and more, &s;o as to &s;queeze out of that lazy people three, four, or even five days labour weekly, without rai&s;ing their wages, or the price of their work. But beware of a ge|neral rule. The effect would be very different in Britain, where moderate labour, without much relaxation, is requi&s;ite for living comfortably: in every &s;uch ca&s;e, a permanent tax upon nece&s;&s;aries will not fail in time to rai&s;e the price of labour. It is true, that in a &s;ingle year of &s;carcity there is com|monly more labour, and even better living, than in plentiful years. But &s;uppo&s;e &s;carcity to continue a number of years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, or &s;uppo&s;e a perma|nent tax on nece&s;&s;aries, wages mu&s;t ri&s;e till the labourer finds comfortable living: if the employer ob&s;tinately &s;tands out, the labourer will in de&s;pair abandon work altogether, and commence beggar; or will retire to a country le&s;s burdened with taxes. Hence a &s;alutary doctrine, That where expence of living equals, or nearly equals, what is gained by bodily labour, moderate taxes renewed from time to time after con&s;iderable intervals, will promote
<PB N="278" REF="282">
indu&s;try, without rai&s;ing the price of labour; but that permanent taxes will unavoidably rai&s;e the price of labour, and of manufactures. In Holland, the high price of provi&s;ions and of labour, occa&s;ioned by permanent taxes, have excluded from the foreign market every one of their manufactures that can be &s;upplied by other nations. Heavy taxes have put an end to their once flouri&s;hing manufactures of wool, of &s;ilk, of gold and &s;ilver, and many others. The prices of labour and of manufactures have in England been immoderately rai&s;ed by the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>To prevent a total downfall of our manufactures, &s;everal political writers have given their opinion, that the labouring poor ought to be di&s;burdened of all taxes. The royal tithe propo&s;ed for France, in&s;tead of all other taxes, publi&s;hed in the name of Mare&s;chal Vauban, or &s;uch a tax laid upon land in England, might originally have produced wonders. But the expedient would now come too late, at lea&s;t in England: &s;uch profligacy have the poor|rates produced among the lower ranks, that to re|lieve them from taxes, would probably make them work le&s;s, but a&s;&s;uredly would not make them work cheaper. It is vain therefore to think of a remedy again&s;t idlene&s;s and high wages, while the poor-rates &s;ub&s;i&s;t in their pre&s;ent form. Davenant pro|nounces, that the Engli&s;h poor-rates will in time be the bane of their manufactures. He computes, that the per&s;ons receiving alms in England amount to one million and two hundred thou&s;and, the half of whom at lea&s;t would have continued to work, had they not relied on pari&s;h-charity. But of this more at large in a &s;eparate &s;ketch.</P>
<P>Were the poor-rates aboli&s;hed, a general act of naturalization would not only augment the &s;trength of Britain, by adding to the number of its people,
<PB N="279" REF="283">
but would compel the natives to work cheaper, and con&s;equently to be more indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>If the&s;e expedients be not reli&s;hed, the only one that remains for pre&s;erving our manufactures is, to encourage their exportation by a bounty, &s;uch as may enable us to cope with our rivals in foreign markets. But where is the fund for a bounty &s;o exten&s;ive? It may be rai&s;ed out of land, like the Athenian tax above mentioned, burdening great proprietors in a geometrical proportion, and freeing tho&s;e who have not above L. 100 of land-rent. That tax would rai&s;e a great &s;um to the public, without any real lo&s;s to tho&s;e who are burdened; for comparative riches would remain the &s;ame as formerly. Nay, &s;uch a tax would in time prove highly beneficial to land-proprietors; for by pro|moting indu&s;try and commerce, it would rai&s;e the rent of land much above the contribution. Can money be laid out &s;o advantageou&s;ly at common intere&s;t? And to reconcile land-holders to the tax, may it not be thought &s;ufficient, that, without a bounty, our foreign commerce mu&s;t vani&s;h, and land be reduced to its original low value? Can any man he&s;itate about paying a &s;hilling, when it en|&s;ures him again&s;t lo&s;ing a pound?</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e with a rule of deeper concern than all that have been mentioned, which is, To avoid taxes that require the oath of party. They are <Q REND="inline">"contra bonos mores,"</Q> as being a temptation to perjury. Few there are &s;o wicked, as to hurt others by perjury: at the &s;ame time, there are not many of the lower ranks &s;o upright, as to &s;cruple much at perjury, when it prevents hurt to them|&s;elves. Con&s;ider the duty on candle. Tho&s;e only who brew for &s;ale, pay the duty on malt-liquor; and to avoid the brewer's oath, the quantity is a&s;certained by officers who attend the proce&s;s. But the duty on candle is oppre&s;&s;ive, not only as com|prehending
<PB N="280" REF="284">
poor people who make no candle for &s;ale, but as &s;ubjecting them to give oath on the quantity they make for their own u&s;e. Figure a poor widow, burthened with five or &s;ix children: &s;he is not permitted to make ready a little food for her infants, by the light of a rag dipped in grea&s;e, without paying what &s;he has not to pay, or being guilty of perjury. However upright originally, poverty and anxiety about her infants will tempt her to conceal the truth, and to deny upon oath:&mdash;a &s;ad le&s;&s;on to her poor children: ought they to be puni&s;hed for copying after their mother, whom they love and revere? whatever &s;he does appears right in their eyes. The manner of levying the &s;alt-tax in France is indeed arbitrary; but it is not productive of immorality: an oath is avoided; and every ma&s;ter of a family pays for the quantity he is pre&s;umed to con&s;ume. French wine is often imported into Britain as Spani&s;h, which pays le&s;s duty. To check that fraud, the importer's oath is required; and if perjury be &s;u&s;pected, a jury is &s;et upon him in exchequer. This is horrid: the importer is tempted by a high duty on French wine to commit perjury; for which he is pro&s;ecuted in a &s;overeign court, open to all the world: he turns de&s;perate, and lo&s;es all &s;en&s;e of honour. Thus cu&s;tom-hou&s;e oaths have become a proverb, as meriting no regard; and corruption creeping on, will become univer&s;al. Some goods imported pay a duty <Q REND="inline">"ad valorem;"</Q> and to a&s;certain the value the importer's oath is required. In China, the books of the merchant are tru&s;ted, without an oath. Why not imitate &s;o laudable a practice? If our people be more corrupted, perjury may be avoid|ed, by ordaining the merchant to deliver his goods to any who will demand them, at the rate &s;tated in his books; with the addition of ten per cent. as a &s;ufficient profit to him&s;elf. Oaths have been great|ly
<PB N="281" REF="285">
multiplied in Britain &s;ince the Revolution, with|out re&s;erve, and contrary to &s;ound policy. New oaths have been contrived again&s;t tho&s;e who are di&s;affected to the government; again&s;t fictious titles in electing parliament-members; again&s;t de|frauding the revenue, &amp;c. &amp;c. They have been &s;o hackneyed, and have become &s;o familiar, as to be held a matter of form merely. Perjury has dwindled into a venial tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and is &s;carce held an imputation on any man's character. La|mentable indeed has been the conduct of our legi&s;|lature: in&s;tead of laws for reforming or improving morals, the imprudent multiplication of oaths has not only &s;pread corruption through every rank, but, by annihilating the authority of an oath over con|&s;cience, has rendered it entirely u&s;ele&s;s.</P>

My part is only to &s;ugge&s;t hints; which will occur in con&s;idering taxes with regard to their effects. And in that view, they may be commodiou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed into five kinds. Fir&s;t, Taxes that encrea&s;e the public revenue, without producing any other effect, good or bad. Second, Taxes that encrea&s;e the public revenue; and are al&s;o beneficial to manufactures and commerce. Third, Taxes that encrea&s;e the public revenue; but are hurtful to manufactures and commerce. Fourth, Taxes that are hurtful to manufactures and commerce, without encrea&s;ing the public re|venue. Fifth, Taxes that are hurtful to manufac|tures and commerce; and al&s;o le&s;&s;en the public revenue. I proceed to in&s;tances of each kind.</P>
<P>The land-tax is an illu&s;trious in&s;tance of the fir&s;t kind: it produces a revenue to the public, levied with very little expence: and it hurts no mortal; for a landholder who pays for having him&s;elf and his e&s;tate protected, cannot be &s;aid to be hurt. The duty on coaches is of the &s;ame kind. Both taxes at the &s;ame time are agreeable to &s;ound principles. Men ought to contribute to the public revenue, ac|cording to the benefit that protection affords them: a rich man requires protection for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as well as for his per&s;on, and therefore ought to contribute largely: a poor man requires protection
<PB N="283" REF="287">
for his per&s;on only, and therefore ought to contri|bute very little.</P>
<P>A tax on foreign luxuries is an in&s;tance of the &s;econd kind. It encrea&s;es the public revenue; and it greatly benefits individuals; not only by re|&s;training the con&s;umption of foreign luxuries, but by encouraging our own manufactures of that kind. Britain enjoys a monopoly of coal exported to Hol|land; and the duty on exportation is agreeable to &s;ound policy, being paid by the Dutch. This duty is an in&s;tance of the &s;econd kind: it rai&s;es a con&s;iderable revenue to the public; and it enables us to cope with the Dutch in every manufacture that employs coal, &s;uch as dying, di&s;tilling, works of gla&s;s and of iron. And the&s;e manufactures in Britain, by the dearne&s;s of labour, are entitled to &s;ome aid. A tax on hor&s;es, to prevent their in|crea&s;e, would be a tax of the &s;ame kind. The incredible number of hor&s;es u&s;ed in coaches and other wheel-carriages, has rai&s;ed the price of la|bour, by doubling the price of oat-meal, the food of the labouring poor in many parts of Britain. The price of wheat is al&s;o rai&s;ed by the &s;ame means; becau&s;e the va&s;t quantity of land employ|ed in producing oats, leaves &s;o much the le&s;s for wheat. I would not exempt even plough-hor&s;es from the tax; becau&s;e in every view it is more ad|vantageous to u&s;e oxen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are pre&s;erable for hu&s;bandry in &s;everal re|&s;pects. They are cheaper than hor&s;es: their food, their harne&s;s, their &s;hoes, the attendance on them, much le&s;s expen&s;ive; and their dung much better for land. Hor&s;es are more &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es, and when di&s;ea&s;ed or old are totally u&s;ele&s;s; upon which account, a &s;tock of hor&s;es for a farm, mu&s;t be renewed at lea&s;t every ten years; whereas a &s;tock of oxen may be kept entire for ever without any new expence, as they will always draw a full price when fatted for food. Nor is a hor&s;e more docile than an ox: a couple of oxen in a plough require not a driver more than a couple of hor&s;es. The Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope plough with oxen; and exerci&s;e them early to a quick pace, &s;o as to equal hor&s;es both in the plough and in the waggon. The people of Malabar u&s;e no other animal for the plough nor for burdens. About Pondichery no bea&s;ts of burden are to be &s;een but oxen. The va&s;t increa&s;e of hor&s;es of late years for luxury as well as for draught, makes a great con&s;umption of oats. If in hu&s;bandry oxen only were u&s;ed, which require no oats, many thou&s;and acres would be &s;aved for wheat and barley. But the advantages of oxen would not be con|fined to the farmer. Beef would become much cheaper to the manufacturer, by the va&s;t addition of fat oxen &s;ent to market; and the price of leather and tallow would fall; a national benefit, as every one u&s;es &s;hoes and candles.</NOTE>. So little regard is paid
<PB N="284" REF="288">
to the&s;e con&s;iderations, that a coach, whether drawn by two hor&s;es or by &s;ix, pays the &s;ame duty.</P>
<P>As to the third kind, I am grieved to ob&s;erve, that we have many taxes more hurtful to individu|als than advantageous to the public revenue. Mul|tiplied taxes on the nece&s;&s;aries of life, candle, &s;oap, leather, ale, &s;alt, &amp;c. rai&s;e the price of labour, con&s;equently of manufactures. If they &s;hall have the effect to deprive us of foreign markets, which we have rea&s;on to dread, depopulation and poverty mu&s;t en&s;ue. The &s;alt-tax in particular is more out of rule than any of the others mentioned: with re|&s;pect to the&s;e, the rich bear the greate&s;t burden, being the greate&s;t con&s;umers; but the &s;hare they pay of the &s;alt-tax is very little, becau&s;e they never touch &s;alt provi&s;ions. The &s;alt-tax is &s;till more ab&s;urd in another re&s;pect, &s;alt being a choice of
<PB N="285" REF="289">
manure for land. One would be amazed to hear of a law prohibiting the u&s;e of lime as a manure: he would be &s;till more amazed to hear of the pro|hibition being extended to &s;alt, which is a manure much &s;uperior: and yet a heavy tax on &s;alt, which renders it too dear for being u&s;ed as a manure, &s;ur|pri&s;es no man. But the mental eye, when left without culture, re&s;embles that of the body: it &s;eldom perceives but what is directly before it: in|ferences and con&s;equences go far out of &s;ight. Ma|ny thou&s;and quarters of good wheat have been an|nually with-held from Britain by the &s;alt-tax. What the trea&s;ury has gained will not amount to the fiftieth part of that lo&s;s The ab&s;urdity of with holding from us a manure &s;o profitable has at la&s;t been di&s;covered; and remedied in part, by permitting Engli&s;h foul &s;alt to be u&s;ed for manure, on paying four pence of duty per bu&s;hel<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">8^o Geo. III. cap. 25.</NOTE>. Why was not Scotland permitted to ta&s;te of that bounty? Our candidates, it would appear, are more &s;olici|tous of a &s;eat in parliament, than of &s;erving their country when they have obtained that honour.</P>
<P>The window-tax is more detrimental to the common intere&s;t than advantageous to the public revenue. In the fir&s;t place, it promot s large farms in order to &s;ave hou&s;es and windows; whereas &s;mall farms tend to multiply a hardy and frugal race, u&s;eful for every purpo&s;e. In the next place, it is a di&s;couragement to manufactures, by taxing the hou&s;es in which they are carried on. Manu|facturers, in order to relieve them&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible from the tax, make the whole &s;ide of their hou&s;e a &s;ingle window; and there are in&s;tances where in three &s;tories there are but three windows. The tax, at the &s;ame time, is impo&s;ed with no
<PB N="286" REF="290">
degree of equality: a hou&s;e in a paultry village that affords not five pounds of yearly rent, may have a greater number of windows than one in London rented at fifty. In this re&s;pect it runs counter to &s;ound policy, by ea&s;ing the rich, and burdening the poor. The &s;ame objection lies again&s;t the plate-tax. It is not indeed hurtful to manufac|tures and commerce: but it is hurtful to the com|mon intere&s;t; becau&s;e plate converted into money may be the means of &s;aving the nation at a cri&s;is, and therefore ought to be encouraged, in&s;tead of being loaded with a tax. On pictures imported into Britain, a duty is laid in proportion to the &s;ize. Was there no intelligent per&s;on at hand, to inform our legi&s;lature, that the only means to rou&s;e a genius for painting, is to give our youth ready acce&s;s to good pictures? Till the&s;e be multiplied in Britain, we never &s;hall have the reputation of pro|ducing a good painter. So far indeed it is lucky, that the mo&s;t valuable pictures are not loaded with a greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uty than the mo&s;t execrable. Fi&s;h, both &s;alt and fre&s;h, brought to Paris, pay a duty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">8 per cent. by an arbitrary e&s;timation of the value. This tax is an irreparable injury to France, by di&s;couraging the multiplication of &s;eamen. It is beneficial indeed in one view, as it tends to check the growing population of that great city.</P>
<P>Without waiting to rummage the Briti&s;h taxes for examples of the fourth kind, I &s;hall pre&s;ent my reader with a foreign in&s;tance. In the Au&s;trian Netherlands, there are inexhau&s;tible mines of coal, the exportation of which would make a con&s;iderable article of commerce, were it not ab&s;olutely barred by an exorbitant duty. This ab&s;urd duty is a great injury to proprietors of coal, without yielding a farthing to the government. The Dutch many years ago offered to confine them&s;elves to that country for coal, on condition of being relieved
<PB N="287" REF="291">
from the duty; which would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> down the price below that of Briti&s;h coal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> wonderful, that the propo&s;al was rejected? But mini&s;ters &s;eldom regard what is beneficial to the nation, unle&s;s it produce an immediate benefit to their &s;overeign or to them&s;elves. The coal mines in the Au&s;trian Netherlands being thus &s;hut up, and the art of working them lo&s;t, the Briti&s;h enjoy the monopoly of exporting coal to Holland.</P>
<P>The duty on coal water-borne is an in&s;tance of the fifth kind. A great ob&s;truction it is to many u&s;eful manufactures that require coal; and indeed to manufactures in general, by increa&s;ing the ex|pence of coal, an e&s;&s;ential article in a cold country. Nay, one would imagine, that it has been intended to check population; as poor wretches, benumbed with cold, feel little of the carnal appetite. It has not even the merit of adding much to the public revenue; for, laying a&s;ide London, it produces but a mere tri&s;le. But the peculiarity of this tax, which intitles it to a con&s;picuous place in the fifth cla&s;s, is, that it is not le&s;s detrimental to the public revenue than to individuals. No &s;edentary art nor occupation can &s;ucceed in a cold climate without plenty of &s;ewel. One may at the fir&s;t glance di&s;|tingui&s;h the coal-countries from the re&s;t of England, by the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, and by plenty of manufacturing towns and villages. Where there is &s;carcity of fewel, &s;ome hours are lo&s;t every morning; becau&s;e people cannot work till the place be &s;uffi|ciently warmed, which is e&s;pecially the ca&s;e in manufactures that require a &s;oft and delicate finger. Now, in many parts of Britain which might be provided with coal by water, the labouring poor are deprived of that comfort by the tax. Had cheap firing encouraged the&s;e people to pro&s;ecute arts and manufactures; it is more than probable, that at this day they would be contributing to the
<PB N="288" REF="292">
public revenue by other duties, much greater &s;ums than are drawn from them by the duty on coal. At the &s;ame time, if coal mu&s;t pay a duty, why not at the pit, where it is the cheape&s;t? Is it not an egregious blunder, to lay a great duty on tho&s;e who pay a high price for coal, and no duty on tho&s;e who have it cheap? If there mu&s;t be a coal|duty, let water-borne coal at any rate be exempted; not only becau&s;e even without duty it comes dear to the con&s;umer, but al&s;o for the encouragement of &s;eamen. For the honour of Britain this duty ought to be expunged from our &s;tatute book, never again to &s;how its face. Great rea&s;on indeed there is for continuing the duty on coal con&s;umed in London; becau&s;e every artifice &s;hould be put in practice, to prevent the increa&s;e of a head, that is already too large for the body, or for any body Towns are unhealthy in proportion to their &s;ize; and a great town like London is a greater enemy to population than war or &s;amine.</P>

<HEAD>REGULATIONS for advancing INDUSTRY and COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>OF all &s;ciences, that of politics is the mo&s;t in|tricate; and its progre&s;s toward maturity is &s;low in proportion. In the pre&s;ent &s;ection, taxes on exportation of native commodities take the lead; and nothing can &s;et in a &s;tronger light the gro&s;s ig|norance of former ages, than a maxim univer&s;ally adopted, That to tax exportation, or to prohibit it altogether, is the be&s;t means for having plenty at home. In Scotland we were not &s;atisfied with pro|hibiting the exportation of corn, of fi&s;h, and of hor&s;es: the prohibition was extended to manufac|tures; linen cloth, for example, candle, butter, chee&s;e, barked hides, &s;hoes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oil was the only commodity that by the laws of Solon was permitted to be exported from Attica. The figs of that country, which are delicious, came to be produced in &s;uch plenty, that there was no &s;ufficient con&s;umpt for them at home; and yet the law prohi|biting exportation was not abrogated. Sycophant de|notes a per&s;on who informs again&s;t the exporter of figs: but the prohibition appearing ab&s;urd, &s;ycophant be|came a term of reproach.</NOTE><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Act 59. parl. 1753.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Duties on exportation are in great favour from a notion that they are paid by foreigners. This holds &s;ometimes, as in the above-mentioned ca&s;e of coal exported to Holland: but it fails in every ca&s;e where
<PB N="290" REF="294">
the foreign market can be &s;upplied by others; for whatever be the duty, the merchant mu&s;t regulate his price by the market. And even &s;uppo&s;ing the market-price at pre&s;ent to be &s;ufficient for the du|ty, with a rea&s;onable profit to the exporter, tho&s;e who pay no duty will &s;train every nerve of rival&s;hip, till they cut us out by low prices. The duty on French wine exported from France, is equal to a bounty to the wines of neighbouring countries. At the &s;ame time, the duty is un&s;kilfully impo&s;ed, being the &s;ame upon all wines exported, without regard to flavour or &s;trength: which bars the com|merce of &s;mall wines, though much more plenti|ful. A moderate duty on exportation, &s;uch as &s;mall wines can bear, would add a greater &s;um to the revenue, and al&s;o be more beneficial to com|merce. To improve the commerce of wine in France, the exportation ought to be free, or, at mo&s;t, charged with a moderate duty ad valorem. In Spain an exce&s;&s;ive duty is laid upon the plant barrile when exported; from a per&s;ua&s;ion that it will not grow in any other country. It is not con|&s;idered, that this tax, by le&s;&s;ening the demand, is a di&s;couragement to its culture. A moderate duty would rai&s;e more money to the public, would em|ploy more hands, and would make that plant a per|manent article of commerce. The exce&s;&s;ive duty has &s;et invention at work, for &s;ome material in place of that plant. If &s;uch a material &s;hall be di&s;|covered, the Spani&s;h mini&s;try will be convinced of a &s;alutary maxim, That it is not always &s;afe, to in|terrupt by high duties the free cour&s;e of commerce. Formerly in Britain the exportation of manufactur|ed copper was prohibited. That blunder in com|mercial politics was corrected by a &s;tatute in the reign of King William, permitting &s;uch copper to be exported, on paying a duty of four &s;hillings the hundred weight. The exportation ought to have
<PB N="291" REF="295">
been declared free; which was done by a &s;tatute of Queen Anne. But as people are apt to overdo in the rage of improvement, this &s;tatute permits even unwrought copper, a raw material, to be exported. This probably was to favour copper-mines: but did it not al&s;o &s;avour foreign copper-manufactures? Goods and merchandize of the product or manu|facture of Great Britain may be exported duty free<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">George I. cap. 14. act 8.</NOTE>. Alum, lead, and &s;ome other commodities &s;pecified in the &s;tatute, are excepted; and a duty formerly paid on exportation is continued, for en|couraging &s;uch of our own manufactures as employ any of the articles &s;pecified. In Ireland to this day, goods exported are loaded with a high duty, with|out even di&s;tingui&s;hing made work from raw mate|rials; corn, for example, fi&s;h, hops, butter, horn|ed cattle, wrought iron, leather, and every thing made of it, &amp;c. &amp;c. And that nothing may e&s;cape, all goods exported that are not contained in the book of rates, pay 5 per cent. ad valorem.</P>
<P>When Sully entered on the admini&s;tration of the French finances, the corn in France was at an ex|orbitant price, occa&s;ioned by neglect of hu&s;bandry during the civil war. That &s;agacious mini&s;ter di&s;|covered the &s;ecret of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing agriculture, and of reducing the price of corn, which is, to al|low a free exportation. So rapid was the &s;ucce&s;s of that bold but politic mea&s;ure, that in a few years France became the granary of Europe; and what at pre&s;ent may appear wonderful, we find in the Engli&s;h records, anno 1621, bitter complaints of the French under&s;elling them in their own markets. Colbert, who, fortunately for us, had imbibed the common error, renewed the ancient prohibition of exporting corn, hoping to have it cheap at home for his manufacturers. But he was in a gro&s;s mi&s;|take;
<PB N="292" REF="296">
for that prohibition has been the chief cau&s;e of many famines in France &s;ince that time. The corn-trade in France lay long under great di&s;cou|ragements; and the French mini&s;try continued long blind to the intere&s;t of their country. At la&s;t edicts were i&s;&s;ued, authori&s;ing the commerce of corn to be ab&s;olutely free, whether &s;old within the king|dom or exported. The generality however conti|nued blind. In the year 1768, the badne&s;s of the harve&s;t having occa&s;ioned a famine, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the people were exce&s;&s;ive, and their complaints uni|ver&s;al. Overlooking altogether the bad harve&s;t, they, from amazing partiality, attributed their mi|&s;ery to the new law. It was in vain inculcated, that freedom in the corn-trade encourages agriculture: the popular opinion was adopted even by mo&s;t of the parliaments; &s;o difficult it is to eradicate e&s;tabli&s;h|ed prejudices. In Turky, about thirty years ago, a grand vizir permitted corn to be exported more freely than had been done formerly, a bu&s;hel of wheat being &s;old at that time under &s;eventeen pence. Every nation flocked to Turky for corn; and in particular no fewer than three hundred French ve&s;&s;els, from twenty to two hundred tons, entered Smyrna bay in one day. The Jani&s;&s;aries and po|pulace took the alarm, fearing that all the corn would be exported, and that a famine would en&s;ue. In Con&s;tantinople they grew mutinous, and could not be appea&s;ed till the vizir was &s;trangled, and his body thrown out to them. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who re|&s;olved not to &s;plit on the &s;ame rock, prohibited ex|portation ab&s;olutely. In that country, rent is paid in proportion to the product; and the farmers, who &s;aw no demand, neglected tillage. In le&s;s than three years the bu&s;hel of wheat ro&s;e to &s;ix &s;hillings, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the people became intolerable. To this day, the fate of the good vizir is lament|ed.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="297">
We have improved upon Sully's di&s;covery, by a bounty on corn exported, which has an&s;wered our mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. A great increa&s;e of gold and &s;ilver &s;ub&s;equent to the &s;aid bounty, which has rai&s;ed the price of many other commodities, mu&s;t have al&s;o rai&s;ed that of corn, had not &s;till a greater increa&s;e of corn, occa&s;ioned by the bounty, reduced its price even below what it was formerly; and by that means our manufactures have profited by the bounty no le&s;s than our hu&s;bandry. The bounty is &s;till more important in another re&s;pect: agriculture in France lies under many di&s;courage|ments; the greate&s;t of which is, that our wheat can be afforded as cheap in their markets as their own: and by prohibiting exportation, it is in our power, during a war, to da&s;h all the French &s;chemes for conque&s;t, by depriving them of bread<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Between the years 1715 and 1755 there was of wheat exported from England into France twenty one millions of &s;eptiers, e&s;timated at two hundred millions of livres. The bounty for exporting corn has &s;ome|times amounted to L. 150,000 for a &s;ingle year. But this &s;um is not all lo&s;t to the public; for frequently our corn is exchanged with goods that pay a high duty on importation.</NOTE>. This bounty therefore is our palladium, which we ought religiou&s;ly to guard, if we would avoid being a pro|vince of France. Some &s;age politicians have begun of late to mutter again&s;t the bounty, as feeding our rival manufacturers cheaper than our own; which is a mi&s;take, for the expence of exportation com|monly equals the bounty. But &s;uppo&s;ing it true, will the evil be remedied by withdrawing the boun|ty? On the contrary, it will di&s;courage manufac|tures, by rai&s;ing the price of wheat at home. It will be&s;ide encourage French hu&s;bandry, &s;o as in all probability to reduce the price of their wheat below what we a&s;&s;ord it to them. In France, labour is
<PB N="294" REF="298">
cheaper than in England, the people are more fru|gal, they po&s;&s;e&s;s a better &s;oil and climate: what have we to balance the&s;e &s;ignal advantages but our bounty? and were that bounty withdrawn, I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee French corn poured in upon us, at a lower price than it can be furni&s;hed at home; the very game that was played again&s;t us, during Sully's admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The exportation of Briti&s;h manufactures to our American colonies ought to meet with &s;uch en|couragement as to prevent them from rivalling us: it would be a gro&s;s blunder to encourage their ma|nufactures, by impo&s;ing a duty on what we export to them. We ought rather to give a bounty on ex|portation; which, by under&s;elling them in their own markets, would qua&s;h every attempt to rival|&s;hip.</P>
<P>As the duty on foreign linen imported into Britain is drawn back when exported to America, our le|gi&s;lature gave a bounty on our coar&s;e linen exported to that country, which enables us to cope with the Germans in the American markets. The &s;taining, or printing of linen cloth, has of late become a con&s;iderable article in the manufactures of Britain; and there is no &s;ort of linen more proper for that manufacture than our own. The duty of foreign linen is drawn back when exported to America, whether plain or &s;tamped: and as we lo&s;e the boun|ty on our coar&s;e linen when &s;tamped, none but fo|reign linen is employed in the &s;tamping manufac|ture. This is an over&s;ight &s;uch as our legi&s;lature is guilty of &s;ometimes.</P>
<P>It is not always true policy, to di&s;courage the ex|portation of our own rude materials: liberty of ex|portation gives encouragement to produce them in greater plenty at home; which con&s;equently lowers the price to our manufacturers. Upon that princi|ple, the exporting corn is permitted, and in Bri|tain
<PB N="295" REF="299">
even encouraged with a bounty. But where ex|portation of a rude material will not encrea&s;e its quantity, the prohibition is good policy, For ex|ample, the exporting of rags for paper may be pro|hibited; becau&s;e liberty of exporting will not oc|ca&s;ion one yard more of linen cloth to be con&s;umed.</P>
<P>Lyons is the city of Europe where the greate&s;t quantity of &s;ilk &s;tuffs is made: it is at the &s;ame time the greate&s;t &s;taple of raw &s;ilk; the &s;ilk of Italy, of Spain, of the Levant, and of the &s;outh of France, being there collected. The exportation of raw &s;ilk is prohibited in France, with a view to le&s;&s;en its price at home, and to ob&s;truct the &s;ilk-manufacture among foreigners. The fir&s;t is a gro&s;s error; the prohibition of exportation producing &s;carcity, not plenty: and with re&s;pect to the other view, it &s;eems to have been overlooked, that the commerce of the &s;ilks of Italy, of Spain, and of the Levant, is not confined to France, but is open to all trading nati|ons. This prohibition is indeed &s;o injudicious, that without any benefit to France, it has done irrepara|ble mi&s;chief to the city of Lyons: while the com|merce of raw &s;ilk, both buying and &s;elling, was monopolized by the merchants of that city, they had it in their power to regulate the price; but to compel foreigners to go to the fountain-head, not only rai&s;es the price by concurrence of purcha&s;ers, but deprives Lyons of a lucrative monopoly. The &s;ame blunder is repeated with re&s;pect to raw &s;ilk &s;pun and dyed. In Lyons, &s;ilk is prepared for the loom with more art than any where el&s;e; and to &s;e|cure the &s;ilk-manufacture, the exportation of &s;pun &s;ilk is prohibited; which mu&s;t rou&s;e foreigners to be&s;tow their utmo&s;t attention upon improving the &s;pinning and dre&s;&s;ing of &s;ilk: and who knows whe|ther reiterated trials by per&s;ons of genius, may not, in England for example, bring the&s;e branches of the
<PB N="296" REF="300">
manufacture to greater perfection, than they are even in Lyons?</P>
<P>Whether we have not committed a blunder of the &s;ame kind in prohibiting exportation of our wool, is a very &s;erious que&s;tion, which I proceed to examine. A &s;pirit for hu&s;bandry, and for every &s;ort of im|provement, is in France turning more and more general. In &s;everal provinces there are &s;ocieties, who have command of public money for promoting agriculture; and about no other article are the&s;e &s;o|cieties more &s;olicitous, than about improving the &s;taple of their wool. A book lately publi&s;hed in Sweden, and tran&s;lated into French, has in&s;pired them with &s;anguine hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; as it contains an account of the Swedi&s;h wool being greatly im|proved in quality, as well as in quantity, by im|porting Spani&s;h and Engli&s;h &s;heep for breed. Now as France is an exten&s;ive country, &s;ituated between Spain and England, two excellent wool-countries, it would be &s;trange, if there &s;hould not be found a &s;ingle corner in all France, where wool may be advanced to &s;ome degree of perfection. Britain may be ju&s;tly apprehenfive of the&s;e attempts; for if France can cope with us under the di&s;advantage of procuring our wool by &s;muggling, how far will they exceed us with good wool of their own? The wool|len cloth of England has always been held its capital manufacture; and patrioti&s;m calls on every one to prevent if po&s;&s;ible the lo&s;s of that valuable branch. Till &s;omething better be di&s;covered, I venture to pro|po&s;e what at fir&s;t may be thought a &s;trange mea&s;ure, and that is, to permit the exportation of our wool upon a moderate duty, &s;uch as will rai&s;e the price to the French, but not &s;uch as to encourage &s;mug|gling. The opportunity of procuring wool in the neighbourhood at a moderate price, joined with &s;e|veral un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to improve the &s;taple of
<PB N="297" REF="301">
their own wool, would &s;oon make the French aban|don thoughts of that improvement.</P>
<P>Experience has unfolded the advantages of liberty to export corn: it has greatly encouraged agricul|ture, and, by increa&s;ing the quantity of corn, has made it even cheaper at home than formerly. Have we not rea&s;on to expect a &s;imilar con&s;equence, from the &s;ame mea&s;ure with re&s;pect to wool? A new vent for that commodity would increa&s;e the number of our &s;heep, meliorate the land by their dung, and probably bring down the price of our wool at home. It is proper indeed to prohibit the exportation of wool, as of corn, when the price ri&s;es above a cer|tain &s;um; which would have the double effect of &s;ecuring plenty to our&s;elves, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing our ri|vals at critical times when the commodity is &s;carce.</P>
<P>There is one rea&s;on that &s;hould influence our le|gi&s;lature to permit the exportation of wool, even &s;uppo&s;ing the foregoing arguments to be inconclu|&s;ive: Very long experience may teach us, if we can be taught by experience, that vain are our en|deavours to prevent wool from being exported: it holds true with re&s;pect to all prohibitions, that &s;muggling will always prevail, where the profits ri&s;e above the ri&s;k. Why not then make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, by permitting exportation under a duty? One other mea&s;ure would re&s;tore the Engli&s;h wool|len manufacture to its pri&s;tine &s;plendor, which is, to apply the &s;um ari&s;ing from the tax as a premium for exporting woollen goods. Were that mea&s;ure adopted, the liberty of exporting wool would prove a &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing to England.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e this branch with a commercial le&s;&s;on, to which every other con&s;ideration ought to yield. The trade of a nation depends for the mo&s;t part on very delicate circum&s;tances, and requires to be carefully nur&s;ed. Foreigners, in particular, ought to be flat|tered and encouraged, that they may prefer us be|fore
<PB N="298" REF="302">
others. Nor ought we ever to rely entirely on our natural advantages; for it is not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee what may occur to overbalance them. As this re|flection is no le&s;s obvious than weighty, facts will be more effectual than argument for making a deep impre&s;&s;ion. The Swi&s;s &s;ome years ago imported all their wines from the King of Sardinia's dominions. The King laid a high duty on the&s;e wines, knowing that the Swi&s;s had not ready acce&s;s to any other wine-country. He did not fore&s;ee, that this high duty was equal to a premium for cultivating the vine at home. They &s;ucceeded; and now are provided with wine of their own growth. The city of Lyons, by making &s;ilver-thread in perfection, had maintained a monopoly of that article again&s;t fo|reigners, as well as natives. But a high duty on the exporting it, in order to monopolize al&s;o the manufacture of &s;ilver-lace, will probably excite fo|reigners to improve their own &s;ilver-thread and &s;il|ver-lace; and France will be deprived of both mo|nopolies, by the very means employed for &s;ecuring both. Engli&s;h goods purcha&s;ed by Spaniards for the American market, pay to the King of Spain on ex|portation a duty equal to their value. This impo|litic mea&s;ure opens a wide door to &s;muggling; as Engli&s;h goods can be furni&s;hed 50 per cent. cheaper from Jamaica. The Spani&s;h governor of Mexico joins underhand in the &s;muggling; which is com|monly carried on in the following manner. The governor, to whom early notice is given, i&s;&s;ues a proclamation, bearing, that a foreign &s;hip, with Engli&s;h goods on board, every article being &s;peci|fied, is hovering on the coa&s;t; and prohibiting, un|der &s;evere penalties, any per&s;on to be a purcha&s;er. That public proclamation, which is virtually a pub|lic adverti&s;ement, has the de&s;ired effect. All flock to the &s;hore, and purcha&s;e in perfect tranquillity.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="303">
Be&s;ide heavy duties, commerce with foreigners has been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by many unwary regulations. The herring-fi&s;hery, which is now an immen&s;e ar|ticle of commerce, was engro&s;&s;ed originally by the Scots. But gra&s;ping at all advantages, the royal boroughs of Scotland, in the reign of the &s;econd James, prohibited their fi&s;hermen to &s;ell herrings at &s;ea to foreigners; ordering, that the herring &s;hould be fir&s;t landed, in order that they them&s;elves might be fir&s;t &s;erved. Such was the police of tho&s;e times. But behold the con&s;equence. The Ne|therlanders, and people of the Han&s;e towns, being prohibited to purcha&s;e as formerly, became fi&s;hers them&s;elves, and cut the Scots out of that profitable branch of trade. The tar-company of Sweden, taking it for granted, that the Engli&s;h could not otherwi&s;e be &s;upplied, refu&s;ed to let them have any pitch or tar, even for ready money, unle&s;s permit|ted to be imported into England in Swedi&s;h bottoms; and con&s;equently in &s;uch quantities only as the com|pany &s;hould be plea&s;ed to furni&s;h. This hard&s;hip moved the parliament to give a bounty for pitch and tar made in our own colonies. And if we be not already, we &s;hall &s;oon be altogether independent of Sweden. The Dutch, excited by the profitable trade of Portugal with the Ea&s;t Indies, attempted a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age to China; and that proving abor|tive, they &s;et on foot a trade with Li&s;bon for Ea&s;t-India commodities. Portugal was at that time &s;ub|ject to the King of Spain; and the Dutch, though at war with Spain, did not doubt of their being well received in Portugal, with which kingdom they had no cau&s;e to quarrel. But the King of Spain, overlooking not only the law of nations, but even his own intere&s;t as King of Portugal, confi&s;|cated at &s;hort-hand the Dutch &s;hips and their car|goes, in the harbour of Li&s;bon. That unju&s;t and unpolitic treatment provoked the Dutch to attempt
<PB N="300" REF="304">
an Ea&s;t-India trade, which probably they would not otherwi&s;e have thought of; and they were &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful, as to &s;upplant the Portugue&s;e in every quar|ter. And thus the King of Spain, by a gro&s;s error in politics, exalted his enemies to be a powerful ma|ritime &s;tate. Had he encouraged the Dutch to trade with Li&s;bon, other nations mu&s;t have re&s;orted to the &s;ame market. Portugal thereby would have been rai&s;ed to &s;uch a height of maritime power, as to be afraid of no rival. The Dutch would not have thought of coping with them, nor would any other nation.</P>
<P>We proceed to foreign commodities, and the mea&s;ures laid down for regulating their importation, which have different views. One is, to keep down a rival power; in which view it is prudent to prohi|bit importation from one country, and to encou|rage it from another. It is judicious in the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, to load French wines with a higher duty than tho&s;e of Portugal; and in France, it would be a proper mea&s;ure, to prefer the beef of Hol&s;tein, or of Ru&s;&s;ia, before that of Ireland; and the to|bacco of the Ukraine, or of the Palatinate, before that of Virginia. But &s;uch mea&s;ures of govern|ment ought to be &s;paringly exerci&s;ed, for fear of retaliation.</P>
<P>There is no cau&s;e more cogent for regulating im|portation, than an unfavourable balance. By per|mitting French goods to be imported free of duty, the balance again&s;t England was computed to be a million Sterling yearly. In the year 1678, that importation was regulated; which, with a prohibi|tion of wearing Ea&s;t-India manufactures, did in twenty years turn the balance of trade in favour of England.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Briti&s;h regulations with regard to goods imported, are contrived for promoting our own manufactures, or tho&s;e of our colonies. A &s;ta|tute,
<PB N="301" REF="305">
3^o Edward IV. cap. 4. intitled, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Certain merchandi&s;es not lawful to be brought ready wrought into the kingdom,"</Q> contains a large li&s;t of &s;uch merchandi&s;es; &s;howing the good &s;en&s;e of the Engli&s;h in an early period, intent on promoting their own manufactures. To favour a new manu|facture of our own, it is proper to lay a duty on the &s;ame manufacture imported. To encourage the art of throwing &s;ilk, the duty on raw &s;ilk imported is reduced, and that on thrown &s;ilk is heightened. But &s;uch a mea&s;ure ought to be taken with great circum&s;pection, le&s;t it recoil again&s;t our&s;elves. The Swedes, &s;ome years ago, intent on rai&s;ing manu|factures at home, prohibited at once foreign manu|factures, without due preparation. Smuggling en|&s;ued, for people mu&s;t import what they cannot find at home; and the home manufactures were not be|nefited. But the con&s;equences were &s;till more &s;e|vere. Foreign manufactures were formerly pur|cha&s;ed with their copper, iron, timber, pitch, tar, &amp;c.: but now, as foreigners cannot procure the&s;e commodities but with ready money, they re&s;ort to Ru&s;&s;ia and Norway, where commodities of the &s;ame kind are procured by barter. The Swedi&s;h govern|ment, perceiving their error, permit &s;everal foreign manufactures to be imported as formerly. But it is now too late; for the trade flows into another chan|nel; and at pre&s;ent, the Swedi&s;h copper and iron works are far from flouri&s;hing as they once did. In the year 1768, an ordinance was i&s;&s;ued by the court of Spain, prohibiting printed or painted linen and cotton to be imported; intended for encouraging a manufacture of printed cottons projected in Catalo|nia and Aragon. The Spani&s;h mini&s;try have all along been &s;ingularly unlucky in their commercial regulations. It is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that &s;uch a pro|hibition will have no effect, but to rai&s;e the price on the &s;ubjects of Spain; for the prohibited goods
<PB N="302" REF="306">
will be &s;muggled, di&s;couraging as much as ever the intended manufacture. The prudent mea&s;ure would have been, to lay a duty upon printed cottons and linens imported, &s;o &s;mall as not to encourage &s;mug|gling; and to apply that duty for nur&s;ing the infant manufacture. A foreign manufacture ought never to be totally prohibited, till that at home be in &s;uch plenty, as nearly to &s;upply the wants of the natives. During ignorance of political principles, a new ma|nufacture was commonly encouraged with an ex|clu&s;ive privilege for a certain number of years. Thus in Scotland, an exclu&s;ive privilege of export|ing woollen and linen manufactures, was given to &s;ome private &s;ocieties<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Act 42. parl. 1661.</NOTE>. Such a monopoly is rui|nous to a nation; and frequently to the manufac|ture it&s;elf<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See Elements du Commerce, tom. 1. p. 334.</NOTE>. I know no monopoly that in &s;ound politics can be ju&s;tified, except that given to authors of books for fourteen years by an act of Queen Anne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That act is judiciou&s;ly contrived, not only for the benefit of authors, but for that of learning in general. It encourages men of genius to write, and multiplies books both of in&s;truction and amu&s;ement; which, by concurrence of many editors after the monopoly is at an end, are &s;old at the cheape&s;t rate. Many well-di&s;|po&s;ed per&s;ons complain, that the exclu&s;ive privilege be|&s;towed by the &s;tatute upon authors is too &s;hort, and that it ought to be perpetual. Nay, it is a&s;&s;erted, that au|thors have a perpetual privilege by common law; and it was determined lately in the court of king's|bench, that by the common law of England the privi|lege is perpetual. Nothing more frequently happens, than by gra&s;ping at the &s;hadow, to lo&s;e the &s;ub&s;tance; for I have no difficulty to maintain that a perpetual mo|nopoly of books would prove more de&s;tructive to learning, and even to authors, than a &s;econd irruption of Goths and Vandals. It is the nature of monopoly to rai&s;e the price of commodities; and by a perpetual monopoly in the commerce of books, the price of good books would be rai&s;ed far beyond the reach of mo&s;t readers: they would be &s;old like pictures of the great ma&s;ters. The works of Shake&s;peare, for example, or of Milton, would be &s;een in very few libraries. In &s;hort, the &s;ale of good books would be confined to a few learned men, &s;uch as have money to &s;pare, and to a few rich men, who buy out of vanity, as they buy a diamond or a fine coat. Fa&s;hions at the &s;ame time are variable; and books, even the mo&s;t &s;plendid, would wear out of fa&s;hion with men of opulence, and be de&s;|pi&s;ed as antiquated furniture. And with re&s;pect to men of ta&s;te, their number is &s;o &s;mall as not to afford encouragement even for the mo&s;tfrugal edition. Thus book&s;ellers, by gra&s;ping too much, would put an end to their trade altogether; and men of genius would not write, when no price could be afforded for their works. At the &s;ame time, our pre&s;ent authors and book&s;ellers would not be much benefited by &s;uch a mo|nopoly. Not many books have &s;o long a run as four|teen years; and the &s;ucce&s;s of a book on the fir&s;t pub|lication is &s;o uncertain, that a book&s;eller will give lit|tle more for a perpetuity, than for the temporary pri|vilege of the &s;tatute. This was fore&s;een by the le|gi&s;lature; and the privilege was wi&s;ely con&s;ined to fourteen years, equally beneficial to the public and to authors.</NOTE>. Exemption from duty, premiums to the
<PB N="303" REF="307">
be&s;t workmen, a bounty on exportation, joined with a duty on goods of the &s;ame kind imported, and at la&s;t a total prohibition, are the proper encourage|ments to a new manufacture.</P>
<P>The importation of raw materials ought to be en|couraged in every manufacturing country, permit|ting only a moderate duty for encouraging our own rude materials of the &s;ame kind. By a French edict 1654, for encouraging &s;hip-building, &s;hip-timber imported pays no duty. But perhaps a moderate
<PB N="304" REF="308">
duty would have been better policy, in order to en|courage &s;uch timber of the growth of France. Deal timber accordingly, and other timber, im|ported into Britain from any part of Europe, Ire|land excepted, pays a moderate duty. And oak|bark imported pays a duty, which is an encourage|ment to propagate oak at home. The importation of lean cattle from Ireland, which in effect are raw materials, is, by a &s;tatute of Charles II. declared a public nui&s;ance. What gro&s;s ignorance! Is it not evident, that to feed cattle, is more profitable than to breed them? The chief promoter of that not|able &s;tatute, was Sir John Knight, infamous for an in&s;olent &s;peech in King William's reign again&s;t na|turalizing foreign Prote&s;tants, and propo&s;ing to kick out of the kingdom tho&s;e already &s;ettled. Experi|ence hath proved the benefit of importing lean cat|tle into England; witne&s;s the va&s;t quantities im|ported yearly from Scotland. Diamonds, pearls, and jewels of every kind, paid formerly upon im|portation a duty of ten per cent. ad valorem; which by act 6^o George II. cap. 7. was taken off, upon the following preamble: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That London is now be|come a great mart for diamonds and other pre|cious &s;tones, from whence mo&s;t foreign countries are &s;upplied; that great numbers of rough dia|monds are &s;ent here to be cut and poli&s;hed; and that a free importation would encrea&s;e the trade."</Q></P>
<P>Sorry am I to ob&s;erve, that &s;everal of our duties on importation, are far from being conformable to the foregoing rule; many raw materials nece&s;&s;ary for our manufactures being loaded with a duty on importation, and &s;ome with a heavy duty. Barilla, for example, is a raw material u&s;ed in the gla&s;s-ma|nufacture: the exportation from Spain is loaded with a very high duty: and to rai&s;e the price &s;till higher, we add another duty on importation; with|out
<PB N="305" REF="309">
having the pretext of encouraging a raw mate|rial of our own growth, for barilla grows not in this i&s;land. Hair is a raw material employed in &s;e|veral manufactures; and yet every kind of it, hu|man hair, hor&s;e hair, goat's hair, &amp;c. pays a duty on importation; which con&s;equently rai&s;es the price of our own hair, as well as of what is imported. Nor has this duty, more than the former, the pre|text of being an encouragement to our own pro|duct; for &s;urely there will not on that account be reared one child more, or foal, or kid. The &s;ame objection lies again&s;t the duty on foreign kelp, which is very high. Rancid oil of olives, fit for &s;oap and woollen manufactures, pays upon importation a high duty: were it free of duty, we &s;hould be able to &s;erve our&s;elves with Ca&s;tile &s;oap of home manu|facture; and likewi&s;e our colonies, which are partly &s;upplied by the French. Each of the following raw materials ought in &s;ound policy to be free of duty on importation; and yet they are loaded with a duty, &s;ome with a high duty; pot-a&s;hes, elephant's teeth, raw &s;ilk from the Ea&s;t Indies, lamp-black, bri&s;tles dre&s;&s;ed or undre&s;&s;ed, horns of beeves. Un|dre&s;&s;ed &s;kins, though a rude material, pay a duty on importation; and French kid-&s;kins are honoured above others with a high duty: to reject a great be|nefit to our&s;elves rather than afford a &s;mall benefit to a rival nation, &s;avours more of peevi&s;hne&s;s than of prudence.</P>
<P>For encouraging our colonies, coffee is permitted to be imported from the plantations free of duty, while other coffee pays &s;ix pence per pound. The heavy duty on whalebone and whale-oil imported, which was laid on for encouraging our own whale-fi&s;hing, is taken off with re&s;pect to the importation from our American colonies<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">A George III. cap. 29.</NOTE>. This may put an
<PB N="306" REF="310">
end to our own whale-fi&s;hery: but it will enable the Americans to cope with the Dutch; and who knows whether they may not at la&s;t prevail? For encouraging the culture of hemp and flax in Ame|rica, there is a bounty given upon what is imported into Britain. One would imagine, that our legi&s;la|ture intended to enable the colonies to rival us in a &s;taple manufacture, contrary to the fundamental principle of colonization. But we did not &s;ee &s;o far: we only fore&s;aw a benefit to Britain, in being &s;upplied with hemp and flax from our colonies, ra|ther than from Ru&s;&s;ia and the Low Countries. But even ab&s;tracting from rival&s;hip, was it not obvious, that a bounty for encouraging the culture of hemp and flax at home, would be more &s;ucce&s;sful, than for encouraging the culture in America, where the price of labour is exce&s;&s;ively high, not to talk of the freight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Between the mother-country and her colonies the following rule ought to be &s;acred, That with re&s;pect to commodities wanted, each of them &s;hould prefer the other before all other nations. Britain &s;hould take from her colonies whatever they can furni&s;h for her u&s;e; and they &s;hould take from Britain whatever &s;he can fur|ni&s;h for their u&s;e. In a word, every thing regarding commerce ought to be reciprocal, and equal between them. To bar a colony from acce&s;s to the fountain|head for commodities that cannot be furni&s;hed by the mother-country but at &s;econd-hand, is oppre&s;&s;ion: it is &s;o far degrading the coloni&s;ts from being free &s;ubjects to be &s;laves. What right, for example, has Britain to prohibit her colonies from purcha&s;ing tea or porcelane at Canton, if they can procure it cheaper there than in London? No connection between two nations can be &s;o intimate, as to make &s;uch re&s;traint an act of ju&s;tice. Our legi&s;lature however have acted like a &s;tep-mother to her American colonies. by prohibiting them to have any commerce but with Britain only. They mu&s;t land fir&s;t in Britain all their commodities, even what are not intended to be &s;old there; and they mu&s;t take from Bri|tain, not only its own product, but every foreign com|modity that is wanted. This regulation is not only unju&s;t but impolitic; as by it the intere&s;t of the colo|nies in general is &s;acrificed to that of a few London merchants. Our legi&s;lature have at la&s;t &s;o far opened their eyes, as to give a partial relief.

The encouragement given to foreign linen-yarn, by taking off the duty on importation, is a mea&s;ure that greatly concerns Britain; and how far &s;aluta|ry &s;hall be &s;trictly examined, after &s;tating &s;ome preliminary ob&s;ervations. The fir&s;t is, That as the price of our own commodities can never ri&s;e above that of foreign commodities &s;old here, the price of imported linen mu&s;t regulate the price of home|made linen. The next is, That though the duty on importation is paid by the merchant at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, he relieves him&s;elf of it, by rai&s;ing the price on the purcha&s;er; which of cour&s;e rai&s;es the price of the &s;ame &s;ort of goods made at home; and accordingly a duty on importation is in effect a bounty to our own manufacturers. A third ob&s;erva|tion is, That the price of our linen-cloth ought to be divided between the &s;pinner and the weaver, in &s;uch proportion as to afford bread to both. If the yarn be too high, the weaver is undone; and if too low, the &s;pinner is undone. This was not attended to, when, for encouraging our &s;pinners, a duty of three pence was laid on every pound of imported linen-yarn; which had the effect to rai&s;e the price of our own yarn beyond what the weaver could af|ford. This my&s;tery being unveiled, the duty was fir&s;t lowered to two pence, and then to a penny: our &s;pinners had tolerable bread, and our weavers
<PB N="308" REF="312">
were not oppre&s;&s;ed with paying too high a price for yarn.</P>
<P>Some patriotic gentlemen, who had more zeal than knowledge, finding the linen-manufacture be|nefited by the &s;everal reductions of the duty, ra&s;hly concluded, that it would be &s;till more benefited by a total abolition of the duty. The penny ac|cordingly was taken off<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">29 George II.</NOTE>, and linen-yarn was permitted to be imported duty free; which, if mat|ters had continued as at the date of the act, would have left us not a &s;ingle &s;pinner by profe&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e it would have reduced the price of our yarn below what could afford bread to the &s;pin|ner. Lucky it has been for our linen-manufacture, that the German war, which &s;oon followed, &s;u&s;|pended all their manufactures, and &s;pinning in par|ticular; which proved a favourable opportunity for diffu&s;ing widely the art of &s;pinning, and for mak|ing our &s;pinners more and more dexterous. And yet, now that the war is at an end, it is far from being certain, that our yarn can be afforded as cheap as what is imported from Sile&s;ia. We have good authority for a&s;&s;erting, that the Engli&s;h &s;pinners have &s;uffered by that &s;tatute: from the books of many pari&s;hes it appears, that &s;oon after the &s;tatute, a number of women, who had lived by &s;pinning, became a burden upon the pari&s;h. One thing is evident, that as &s;pinning is the occupation of fe|males who cannot otherwi&s;e be &s;o u&s;efully employ'd, and as more hands are required for &s;pinning than for weaving, the former is the more valuable branch of the manufacture. It ought then to be the pecu|liar concern of our legi&s;lature, not to de&s;troy that branch by impolitic regulations. And yet very lit|tle attention &s;eems to have been given to the public
<PB N="309" REF="313">
intere&s;t, in pa&s;&s;ing the act under con&s;ideration. Why was it not enquired into, whether the intend|ed reduction of the price of yarn would leave bread to the Briti&s;h &s;pinner? The re&s;ult of that enquiry would have been fatal to the intended act; for it would have been clearly &s;een, that the Scotch &s;pinner could not make bread by her work, far le&s;s the Engli&s;h. Other particulars ought al&s;o to have been &s;ugge&s;ted to the legi&s;lature, that flax-&s;pinning is of all occupations the fitte&s;t for women of a cer|tain cla&s;s, confined within &s;mall hou&s;es; that a flax-wheel requires le&s;s &s;pace than a wheel for wool; and that the toughne&s;s of Briti&s;h flax makes it excel for &s;ail-cloth, dowlas, ticking, and &s;heeting. The Briti&s;h &s;pinner might, in a Briti&s;h &s;tatute, have ex|pected the ca&s;t of the &s;cale, had it been but a half-penny per pound on importation.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, why &s;hould there be any in|con&s;i&s;tency in our commercial regulations, when the wi&s;e&s;t heads of the nation are employed about them? Flax, rough or undre&s;&s;ed, being a rude ma|terial, is imported duty-free, but dre&s;&s;ed flax pays a high duty; both of them calculated for encou|raging our own manufacturers. Behold now a flat incon&s;i&s;tency: though dre&s;&s;ed flax, for the rea&s;on given, pays a high duty; yet when by additional labour it is converted into yarn, it pays no duty. How ab&s;urd is this! Further, foreign yarn is not only made welcome duty-free, but even receives a bounty when converted into linen, and exported to our plantations. Have we no rea&s;on to be afraid, that &s;uch indulgence to foreign yarn will deprive us of foreign rough flax? The difference of bulk and freight will determine the Germans to &s;end us no|thing but their yarn, and equally determine our im|porters to commi&s;&s;ion that commodity only.</P>
<P>Goods imported, if &s;ubjected to a duty, are ge|nerally of the be&s;t kind; becau&s;e the duty bears a
<PB N="310" REF="314">
le&s;s proportion to &s;uch than to meaner &s;orts. The be&s;t French wines are imported into Britain, where the duty is higher than in any other country. For that rea&s;on, the be&s;t linen-yarn was imported while the duty &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; but now the German yarn is &s;orted into different kinds, of which the wor&s;t is re|&s;erved for the Engli&s;h market.</P>
<P>Regulations concerning the exportation of com|modities formerly imported, come next in order. And for encouraging &s;uch exportation, one method practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, is, to re&s;tore to the merchant the whole or part of the duty paid at importation; which is termed a drawback. This in particular is done with re&s;pect to tobacco; which by that means can be afforded to foreigners at two pence halfpenny per pound, when the price at home is eight pence halfpenny. But by an omi&s;&s;ion in the act of parlia|ment, a drawback is only given for raw tobacco; which bars the exportation of &s;nuff or manufactured tobacco, as foreigners can under&s;ell us five-and-thirty per cent. Tobacco being an article of luxu|ry, it was well judged in our legi&s;lature to lay a heavier duty on what is con&s;umed at home, than on what is exported. Upon the &s;ame principle, the duty that is paid on the importation of coffee and cocoa from our American plantations, is wholly drawn back when exported<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">7 George III. cap. 46.</NOTE>. But as China earthen ware is not intitled to any encouragement from us, and as it is an article of luxury, it gets no drawback, even when exported to America (7 George III. cap. 46.) The exporter of rice from Britain, fir&s;t imported from America, is in|titled to draw back but half the duty paid on impor|tation. Rice imported duty-free might rival our wheat-crop. But the whole duty ought to be drawn back on exportation: it ought to be afforded to our
<PB N="311" REF="315">
neighbours at the lowe&s;t rate, partly to rival their wheat-crop, and partly to encourage our rice-co|lonies.</P>
<P>Tobacco is an article of luxury; and it is well ordered, that it &s;hould come dearer to us than to foreigners. But every wi&s;e admini&s;tration will take the oppo&s;ite &s;ide with re&s;pect to articles that concern our manufactures. Quick&s;ilver pays upon impor|tation a duty of about 8 d. per pound; 7 d. of which is drawn back upon exportation. The inten|tion of the drawback was to encourage the com|merce of quick&s;ilver; without adverting, that to afford quick&s;ilver to foreign manufacturers cheaper than to our own, is a gro&s;s blunder in commercial politics. Again, when quick&s;ilver is manufactured into vermilion or &s;ublimate, no drawback is allow|ed; which effectually bars their exportation: we ought to be a&s;hamed of &s;uch an ab&s;urdity. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, dyers were prohibited to u&s;e logwood, which was ordered to be openly burnt. But the Engli&s;h dyers having acquired the art of fixing colours made of logwood, it was permitted to be imported<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Act 13 &amp; 14 Charles II. cap. 11. &sect; 26, 27.</NOTE>, every ton paying on importation L. 5; L. 4. of which was to be drawn back upon exportation. That law, made in the days of igno|rance, was intended to encourage the commerce of logwood; and had that effect: but the blunder of di&s;couraging our own manufactures, by furni&s;hing logwood cheaper to our rivals, was overlooked. Both articles were put upon a better footing<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Act 8 George I. c. 14.</NOTE>, giv|ing a greater encouragement to the commerce of logwood, by allowing it to be imported duty-free; and by giving an advantage to our own manufac|tures, by laying a duty of 40 s. upon every hun|dred weight exported. La&s;tly, Still more to en|courage
<PB N="312" REF="316">
the commerce of logwood<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">7 George III. cap. 47.</NOTE>, the duty upon exportation is di&s;continued. It will have the effect propo&s;ed: but will not that benefit be more than balanced by the encouragement it gives to fo|reign manufactures? By the late peace, we have obtained the monopoly of gum-&s;enega; and proper mea&s;ures have been taken for turning it to the be&s;t account: the exportation from Africa is confined to Great Britain; and the duty on importation is only &s;ix pence per hundred weight: but the duty on ex|portation from Britain is thirty &s;hillings per hun|dred weight<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">5 George III. cap. 37.</NOTE>; which, with freight, commi&s;&s;ion, and in&s;urance, makes it come dear to foreigners. Formerly, every beaver's &s;kin paid upon importa|tion &s;even pence of duty; and the exporter re|ceived a drawback of four pence; as if it had been the purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature, to make our own peo|ple pay more for that u&s;eful commodity than foreign|ers. Upon obtaining a monopoly of beaver-&s;kins by the late peace, that ab&s;urd regulation was alter|ed: a penny per &s;kin of duty is laid on importation, and &s;even pence on exportation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">4 George III. cap. 9.</NOTE>. By that means beaver-&s;kins are cheaper here than in any other country of Europe. A &s;imilar regulation is e&s;tabli&s;hed with re&s;pect to gum-arabic. A hun|dred weight pays on importation &s;ix pence, and on exportation L. 1, 10 s.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">5 George III. cap. 37.</NOTE>. As the foregoing ar|ticles are u&s;ed in various manufactures, their cheap|ne&s;s in Britain, by means of the&s;e regulations, will probably balance the high price of labour, &s;o as to keep open to us the foreign market.</P>
<P>James I. of England i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, pro|hibiting gold and &s;ilver, whether in coin or plate,
<PB N="313" REF="317">
gold&s;mith's work, or bullion, to be exported. Not to mention the uncon&s;titutional &s;tep of an Engli&s;h King u&s;urping the legi&s;lative power, it was a glar|ing ab&s;urity to prohibit manufactured work from being exported. Gold and &s;ilver, coined or un|coined, are to this day prohibited from being ex|ported from France; a mo&s;t ab&s;urd prohibition, for a merchant will never willingly export gold and &s;ilver; but if the balance be again&s;t him, the ex|portation is unavoidable. The only effect of the prohibition is, to &s;well the merchant's debt; for he mu&s;t have recour&s;e to a &s;muggler, who mu&s;t be tempted with a high bribe to undertake the ex|portation.</P>
<P>A French author remarks, that in no country are commercial regulations better contrived than in Britain; and in&s;tances the following particulars: 1&s;t, Foreign commodities, &s;uch as may rival their own, are prohibited, or burdened with duties. 2d, Their manufactures are encouraged by a free ex|portation. 3d, Raw materials, which cannot be produced at home, cochineal, for example, indigo, &amp;c. are imported free of duty. 4th, Raw mate|rials of their own growth, &s;uch as wool, &s;uller's-earth, &amp;c. are prohibited to be exported. 5th, Every commodity has a free cour&s;e through the kingdom, without duty. And la&s;tly, Duties paid on importation, are repaid on exportation. This remark is for the mo&s;t part well &s;ounded; and yet the facts above &s;et forth will not permit us to &s;ay, that the Engli&s;h commercial laws have as yet ar|rived at perfection.</P>
<P>HAVING thus gone through the &s;everal ar|ticles that enter into the pre&s;ent &s;ketch, I &s;hall clo&s;e with &s;ome general reflections. The management of the finances is a mo&s;t important branch of go|vernment;
<PB N="314" REF="318">
and no le&s;s delicate than important. Taxes may be &s;o contrived as to promote in a high degree the pro&s;perity of a &s;tate; and without much contrivance, they may do much mi&s;chief. The latter, by rendering the &s;overeign odious, and the people mi&s;erable, effectually eradicate patrio|ti&s;m: no other cau&s;e is more fruitful of rebellion; and no other cau&s;e reduces a country to be a more ea&s;y prey to an invader. To that cau&s;e were the Mahomerans chiefly indebted for their conque&s;t of the Greek empire. The people were glad to change their ma&s;ter; becau&s;e, in&s;tead of multiplied, intri|cate, and vexatious duties, they found them&s;elves &s;ubjected to a &s;imple tribute, ea&s;ily collected, and ea&s;ily paid. Had the art of oppre&s;&s;ive taxes been known to the Romans, when they put in practice again&s;t the Carthaginians the utmo&s;t perfidy and cruelty, for making them abandon their city, they probably would have cho&s;en the &s;ofter method of impo&s;ing high duties on exportation and importa|tion, which would have gratified their avarice, and at the &s;ame time have emaciated Carthage, and reduced it to beggary.</P>
<P>But &s;uch taxes require not the aid of external force to &s;ubdue a nation: they alone will reduce it to the mo&s;t contemptible weakne&s;s. From the union of the different Spani&s;h kingdoms under one monarch, there was rea&s;on to expect an exertion of &s;pirit, &s;imilar to that of the Romans, when peace was re&s;tored under Augu&s;tus. Spain was at that period the mo&s;t potent kingdom in Europe, or perhaps in the world; and yet, in&s;tead of flouri&s;h|ing in that advantageous condition, it was, by noxious taxes, brought down to poverty and depo|pulation. The political hi&s;tory of that kingdom, with re&s;pect to its finances, ought to be kept in perpetual remembrance, that kings and their mini|&s;ters
<PB N="315" REF="319">
may &s;hun the de&s;tructive rock upon which Spain hath been wrecked. The cortes of Spain had once as exten&s;ive powers as ever were enjoyed by an Engli&s;h parliament; but at the time of their union, their power being &s;unk to a &s;hadow, the King and his mini&s;ters governed without much control. Britain cannot be too thankful to Provi|dence for her parliament. From the hi&s;tory of every modern European nation, an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on may be gathered, that the three e&s;tates, or a par|liament in our language, are the only proper check again&s;t the ignorance and rapacity of mini&s;ters. The fertility of the Spani&s;h &s;oil is well known. Notwith&s;tanding frequent droughts to which it is liable, it would produce greatly with diligent cul|ture; and in fact, during the time of the Roman domination, produced corn &s;ufficient for its nume|rous inhabitants, and a great &s;urplus, which was annually exported to Italy. During the domina|tion of the Moors, Arabian authors agree, that Spain was extremely populous. An author of that nation, who wrote in the tenth century, reports, that in his time there were in Spain 80 capital cities, 300 of the &s;econd and third orders, be&s;ide villages &s;o frequent, that one could not walk a mile without meeting one or more of them. In Cor|dova alone, the capital of the Moori&s;h empire, he reckons 200,000 hou&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dwelling-hou&s;es, at that time, were not &s;o large, nor &s;o expen&s;ive, as they came to be in later times.</NOTE>, 600 mo&s;ques, and 900 public baths. In the eleventh century, another author mentions no fewer than 12,000 villages in the plain of Seville. Agriculture at that period mu&s;t have been in the utmo&s;t perfection, when Spain could feed &s;uch multitudes. What was the extent of their internal commerce is not recorded;
<PB N="316" REF="320">
but all authors agree, that their foreign commerce was immen&s;e. Be&s;ide many articles of &s;maller va|lue, they exported raw &s;ilk, oil, &s;ugar, a &s;ort of cochineal, quick&s;ilver, iron, wrought and un|wrought manufactures of &s;ilk, of wool, &amp;c. The annual revenue of Abdoulraham III. one of the Spani&s;h Caliphs, was, in money, 12,145,000 di|nares, above five millions Sterling, be&s;ide large quantities of corn, wine, oil, and other fruits. That prince's revenue mu&s;t indeed have been immen&s;e, to &s;upply the &s;ums expended by him. Be&s;ide the annual charges of government, fleets, and armies, he laid out great &s;ums on his private plea&s;ures. Though engaged continually in war, he had money to &s;pare for building a new town three miles from Cordova, named Zehra, after his favourite mi&s;tre&s;s. In that town he erected a magnificent palace, &s;ufficiently capacious for his whole &s;eraglio of &s;ix thou&s;and three hundred per&s;ons. There were in it fourteen hundred columns of African and Spani&s;h marble, nineteen of Ita|lian marble, and one hundred and forty of the fine&s;t kind, a pre&s;ent from the Greek Emperor. In the middle of the great &s;aloon were many images of birds and bea&s;ts in pure gold, adorned with pre|cious &s;tones, pouring water into a large marble ba&s;on. That prince mu&s;t have had immen&s;e &s;tables for hor&s;es, when he entertained, for his con&s;tant guard, no fewer than twelve thou&s;and hor&s;emen, having &s;abres and belts enriched with gold. Upon the city of Zehra alone, including the palace and gardens, were expended annually three hundred thou&s;and dinares, which make above one hundred thou&s;and pounds Sterling; and it re|quired twenty-five years to complete the&s;e works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A pre&s;ent made to Abdoulrahman by Abdoulme|lik, when cho&s;en prime vizir, is a &s;pecimen of the riches of Spain in that period. 1&s;t, 408 pounds of vir|gin gold. 2d, The value of 420,000 &s;equins in &s;ilver ingots. 3d, 400 pounds of the wood of aloes, one piece of which weighed 180 pounds. 4th, 500 ounces of ambergrea&s;e, of which there was one piece that weighed 100 ounces. 5th, 300 ounces of the fine&s;t camphire. 6th, 300 pieces of gold-&s;tuff, &s;uch as were prohibited to be worn but by the Caliph him&s;elf. 7th, A quantity of fine fur. 8th, Hor&s;e-furniture of gold and &s;ilk, Bagdad fabric, for 48 hor&s;es. 9th, 4000 pounds of raw &s;ilk. 10th, 30 pieces of Per&s;ian tape&s;try of &s;urpri&s;ing beauty. 11th, Complete armour for 800 war-hor&s;es. 12th, 1000 bucklers, and 100,000 ar|rows. 13th, Fifteen Arabian hor&s;es, with mo&s;t &s;ump|tuous furniture; and one hundred other Arabian hor&s;es for the King's attendants. 14th, Twenty mules, with &s;uitable furniture. 15th, Forty young men, and twenty young women, complete beauties, all of them dre&s;&s;ed in &s;uperb habits.</NOTE>.</P>

The great fertility of the &s;oil, the indu&s;try of the Moors, and their advantageous &s;ituation for trade, carried on the pro&s;perity of Spain down to the time that they were &s;ubdued by Ferdi|nand of Arragon. Of this we have undoubted evidence, from the condition of Spain in the days of Charles V. and of his &s;on Philip, being e&s;teem|ed at that period the riche&s;t nation in the univer&s;e. We have the authority of U&s;tariz, that the town of Seville, in the period mentioned, contained &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;ilk looms. During the &s;ixteenth century, the woollen cloth of Segovia was e&s;teem|ed the fine&s;t in Europe; and that of Caralonia long maintained its preference in the Levant, in Italy, and in the adjacent i&s;lands. In a memorial addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;econd Philp, Louis Valle de la Cerda reports, that in the fair of Medina he had negotiated bills of exchange to the extent of one
<PB N="318" REF="322">
hundred and fifty-five millions of crowns; and in Spain, at that time, there were &s;everal other fairs no le&s;s frequented.</P>
<P>The expul&s;ion of the Moors deprived Spain of &s;ix or &s;even hundred thou&s;and frugal and indu&s;trious inhabitants; a wound that touched its vitals, but not mortal: tender care, with proper remedies, would have re&s;tored Spain to its former vigour. But unhappily for that kingdom, its political phy|&s;icians were not &s;killed in the method of cure: in|&s;tead of applying healing medicines, they inflamed the di&s;ea&s;e, and rendered it incurable. The mini|&s;try, who, in&s;tigated by the clergy, had prevail|ed on the King to bani&s;h the Moors, dreading lo&s;s of favour if they &s;hould &s;uffer the King's revenues to &s;ink, were forced, in &s;elf-defence, to double the taxes upon the remaining inhabitants. And what could be expected from that fatal mea&s;ure, but ut|ter ruin; when the poor Chri&s;tians, who were too much of gentlemen to be indu&s;trious, had &s;carce been able to crawl under the load of former taxes?</P>
<P>But a matter that affords a le&s;&s;on &s;o in&s;tructive merits a more particular detail. So late as the be|ginning of the la&s;t century, there were exten&s;ive plantations of &s;ugar in the kingdom of Granada, which, upon the occa&s;ion mentioned, were deeply taxed, &s;o as that, with the former taxes, &s;ugar paid thirty-&s;ix per cent. This branch of hu&s;bandry, which could not fail to langui&s;h under &s;uch oppre&s;|&s;ion, was in a deep con&s;umption when the fir&s;t American &s;ugars were imported into Europe, and was totally extingui&s;hed by the lower price of the&s;e &s;ugars. Spain once enjoyed a mo&s;t exten&s;ive com|merce of &s;pirits manufactured at home, perhaps more exten&s;ive than France does at pre&s;ent. But two cau&s;es concurred to ruin that manufacture; fir&s;t, oppre&s;&s;ive taxes; and next, a prohibition to
<PB N="319" REF="323">
the manufacturer, of vending his &s;pirits to any but to the farmers of the revenue; a &s;lavery pa&s;t all endurance. Spani&s;h &s;alt is &s;uperior in quality to that of Portugal, and &s;till more to that of France: when refined in Holland, it produces 10 per cent. more than the former, and 20 per cent. more than the latter; and the making of &s;alt requires in Spain le&s;s labour than in Portugal or in France. Thus Spani&s;h &s;alt may be afforded the cheape&s;t, as requiring le&s;s labour; and yet may draw the highe&s;t price, as &s;uperior in quality: notwith&s;tanding which &s;hining advantages, &s;carce any &s;alt is ex|ported from Spain; and no wonder, for an exor|bitant duty makes it come dearer to the purcha&s;er than any other &s;alt. A more moderate duty would bring more profit to the government; be&s;ide ea&s;ing the labouring poor, and employing them in the manufacture. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">uperior quality of Spani&s;h raw &s;ilk makes it in great reque&s;t; but as the duty upon it exceeds 60 per cent. it can find no vent in a foreign market: nor is there almo&s;t any demand for it at home, as its high price has reduced the &s;ilk-manufacture in Spain to the lowe&s;t ebb, But the greate&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion of all, as it affects every &s;ort of manufacture, is the famous tax known by the name of alcavala, upon every thing bought and &s;old, which was laid on in the fifteenth century by a cortes or parliament, limited expre&s;sly to eight years, and yet kept up, contrary to law, merely by the King's authority. This mon&s;trous tax, ori|ginally 10 per cent. ad valorem, was, by the two Philips III. and IV. augmented to 14 per cent.; &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to de&s;troy all internal commerce, by the encouragement it gives to &s;muggling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following pa&s;&s;age is from U&s;tariz, ch. 96. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"After mature con&s;ideration of the duties impo&s;ed upon commodities, I have not di&s;covered in France, England, or Holland, any duty laid upon the home|&s;ale of their own manufactures, whether the fir&s;t or any &s;ub&s;equent &s;ale. As Spain alone groans under the burden of 14 per cent. impo&s;ed not only on the fir&s;t &s;ale of every parcel, but on each &s;ale, I am jea|lous that this &s;trange tax is the chief cau&s;e of the ruin of our manufactures."</Q> As to the ruinous con&s;e|quences of this tax, &s;ee Bernardo de Ulloa upon the Manufactures and Commerce of Spain, Part 1. ch. 3. ch. 13.

<PB N="320" REF="324">
difficulty of recovering payment of &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive taxes heightened the brutality of the farmers; which ha&s;tened the downfall of the manufactures: poverty and di&s;tre&s;s bani&s;hed &s;uch workmen as could find bread el&s;ewhere; and reduced the re&s;t to beg|gary. The poor hu&s;bandmen &s;unk under the weight of taxes: and, as if this had not been &s;ufficient to ruin agriculture totally, the Spani&s;h mini&s;try &s;uper|added an ab&s;olute prohibition again&s;t exporting corn. The mo&s;t amazing article of all is, that it has been the practice, for more than three centuries, to &s;et a price on corn; which ruins the farmer when the price is low, and yet refu&s;es him the relief of a high price. That agriculture in Spain &s;hould be in a deep con&s;umption, is far from being a wonder: it is rather a wonder that it has not long ago died of that di&s;ea&s;e. Formerly there was plenty of corn for twenty millions of inhabitants, with a &s;urplus for the great city of Rome; and yet at pre&s;ent, and for very many years back, there has not been corn for &s;even millions, its pre&s;ent inhabitants.

Cochineal, cocoa, &s;ugar, &amp;c. im|ported into Spain duty-free, would be a va&s;t fund of commerce with other nations: but a heavy duty on importation is an ab&s;olute bar to that commerce, by forcing the other European nations to provide them&s;elves el&s;ewhere. Spani&s;h oil exported to America would be a great article of commerce, were it not barred by a heavy duty on exportation, equal almo&s;t to a prohibition: and the Spani&s;h Americans, for want of oil, are reduced to u&s;e fat and butter, very improper for a hot climate. The prohibition of planting vines in Mexico, and the exce&s;&s;ive duty on the importation of Spani&s;h wines into that country, have introduced a &s;pirit drawn from the &s;ugar-cane, which, being more de&s;truc|tive than a pe&s;tilence, is prohibited under &s;evere penalties. The prohibition, however, has no ef|fect, but to give the governors of the provinces a monopoly of tho&s;e &s;pirits, which, under their pro|tection, are &s;old publicly; a commerce no le&s;s &s;hameful than de&s;tructive.</P>

The &s;ilver and gold mines in the Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies are, by improper taxes, rendered le&s;s profitable, both to the King and to the proprietors, than they ought to be. The King's &s;hare is the fifth part of the &s;ilver, and the tenth part of the gold, that the mines produce. There is be&s;ide a duty of eighty pia&s;tres upon every quintal of mercury employed in the&s;e mines. The&s;e heavy exactions, have oc|ca&s;ioned

an abandon of all mines but what are of the riche&s;t &s;ort. The inhabitants pay 33 per cent. on the goods imported to them from Spain, and they are &s;ubjected be&s;ide to the alcavala, which is 14 per cent. for every thing bought and &s;old within the country. The mo&s;t provoking tax of all is what is termed la cruciade, being a &s;um paid for indulgence to eat eggs, butter, and chee&s;e, during Lent, which is yielded by the Pope to the King of Spain. The government, it is true, obliges no per&s;on to take out &s;uch an indulgence: but the prie&s;ts refu&s;e every religious con&s;olation to tho&s;e who do not purcha&s;e; and there is not perhaps a &s;ingle per&s;on in Spani&s;h America who is bold enough to &s;tand out again&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is recorded in hi&s;tory another example of de&s;tructive taxes &s;imilar to that now mentioned. Augu&s;tus, on his conque&s;t of Egypt, having brought to Rome the trea&s;ure of its kings, gold and &s;ilver overflowed in Italy; the bulk of which found its way to Con&s;tantinople, when it became the &s;eat of empire. By the&s;e means, Italy was &s;adly impoveri&s;hed: the whole ground had been covered with gardens and villas, now de&s;erted; and there was neither corn nor manufactures to exchange for money. Gold and &s;ilver became now as rare in Italy as they had been of old; and yet the &s;ame taxes that had been paid with ea&s;e during plenty of money, were rigidly exacted, which ruined all.</P>
