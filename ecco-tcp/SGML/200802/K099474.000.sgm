<HEAD>A VOYAGE to the I&s;land of LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is but ju&s;t, dear <HI>Bellamour,</HI> that I &s;hould let you hear from me; and that after a Year's Ab&s;ence, you &s;hou'd at la&s;t be deliver'd from the Unea&s;ine&s;s, which the Uncertainty of my Fate has undoubtedly given you. I have &s;een a|bundance of the World &s;ince my leaving you, but am not &s;ure whether, in my pre&s;ent Condition, I &s;hall have Re&s;olution enough to give you any tolerable Account of my Travels: 'Tis adding to my pre&s;ent Affliction to call to mind my pa&s;t Sor|rows;
<PB N="2" REF="3">
and 'tis increa&s;ing my pre&s;ent Pain, mak|ing my old Wounds bleed a&s;re&s;h, to take a Survey, even in Imagination, of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures, whereof nothing now is remaining but cruel Remembrance. I believe however, that it will be no &s;mall Con|&s;olation to me, to communicate to one of my be&s;t Friends, both my pa&s;t Plea&s;ures and Afflictions; Complaining is &s;ome Ea&s;e to a Per&s;on in Mi&s;ery; I &s;hall forget my Sorrows whil&s;t I am relating my Adventures, and for a Moment make a Truce with my Heart-breaking Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>'Tis now about a Year, as you may remember, &s;ince I embark'd on the wide Ocean, with &s;everal other Per&s;ons, of <HI>all Ages,</HI> and <HI>Conditions,</HI> but mo&s;t of them <HI>very giddy-headed,</HI> in &s;earch of a <HI>de|licious Country,</HI> named <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> whereof we had all of us heard a mo&s;t inchanting De&s;cription. Charm'd with the Thoughts of the Delights we were there to enjoy, we &s;ail'd for &s;ome Days peaceably, and nothing was to be heard but Mirth and Gayety, from one End of the Ve&s;&s;el to the other; when pretty near an I&s;land, where we intended to have taken in Re&s;re&s;hments, there aro&s;e &s;o &s;urious a Tempe&s;t, and the Wind was &s;o boi&s;terous, that in &s;pite of the utmo&s;t Skill and Endeavours of the Pilot, it drove us with Vio|lence to a Coa&s;t quite oppo&s;ite to that to which we were bound: In this Condition, we were
<PB N="3" REF="4">
to&s;s'd up and down, between four and five Days; after which the Weather began to clear up, the Sun &s;hone out with greater Lu&s;tre than ever, and we found our &s;elves not far off of a beautiful I&s;land, which &s;eem'd almo&s;t cover'd with the mo&s;t delightful Gardens, or rather, which &s;eem'd one continued Garden, and a &s;econd terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e. Ravi&s;h'd with the numberle&s;s Beauties, which every where offer'd them&s;elves to our Eye, we were all curious to know the Name of that inviting Country, imagining it that to which we were bound, and that the Pilot had put an agree|able Cheat upon us, when he inform'd us that we had been driven &s;o far out of our Way. But there happen'd to be a Man on board the Ship who undeceived us, having before made the Tour of the I&s;land; accordingly he gave us the follow|ing Information.</P>
<Q><L><HI>This charming I&s;le, which ravi&s;hes the Sight,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is &s;acred to the God of &s;oft De&s;ires;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who to all Mankind's Homage claims a Right,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And ev'ry Brea&s;t inflames with am'rous Fires.</HI></L>
<L><HI>None '&s;cape his Pow'r, all feel the tingling Dart,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Young, the Old, the Monarch, and the Slave;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who is exempt therefrom that has a Heart,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Weak, the Strong, the Coward, or the Brave?</HI></L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5">
<HI>Once in their Lives here all a Vi&s;it make,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And quit their Home to &s;ee this happy I&s;le;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Here their mo&s;t ardent Wi&s;hes Center take,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dependent on the Fair One's Frown or Smile,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ten Thou&s;and different Ways you here may land,</HI></L>
<L><HI>No Wind's ami&s;s to bring you into Port;</HI></L>
<L><HI>No Chains, no Guards, to bar the Entrance &s;tand,</HI></L>
<L><HI>All Sides lie open for a free Re&s;ort.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Th'</HI> Agreeables, <HI>the</HI> Beauties, Graces, Charms,</L>
<L><HI>Have all the Ports committed to their Care;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And making u&s;e of</HI> Love<HI>'s re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Arms,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Let fly at all, and not a Heart they &s;pare.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Whil&s;t this Man was giving us this Informa|tion, we &s;till drew nearer and nearer to the I&s;land; till by that Time he had made an End we were come &s;o nigh that we cou'd di&s;tingui&s;h every Object.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Here the &s;till Ocean quiet flows,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As the lea&s;t Chry&s;tal purling Streams;</HI></L>
<L><HI>No Wind but the &s;oft</HI> Zephyr <HI>blows,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And o'er the level Surface &s;kims;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who&s;e plea&s;ing Murmurs whil&s;t you hear,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In &s;porting with the wanton Seas;</HI></L>
<L><HI>That Nature's Self did &s;leep you'd &s;wear,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And therefore left the World at Peace.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6">
<HI>A Thou&s;and Flowers along the Shore,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Pink, the Lilly, and the Ro&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With Plea&s;ure vye their beauteous Store,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet the lea&s;t Wonders there di&s;clo&s;e.</HI></L></Q>
<P>In Effect, all along the Shore, one &s;ees an in|finite Number of Things, that create Admiration; all the <HI>Beauties</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> all that is <HI>agreeable</HI> and <HI>charming</HI> is perpetually to be beheld there; but what &s;urprized me the mo&s;t was, to ob&s;erve both the <HI>Old,</HI> and the <HI>Ugly,</HI> in Company with the <HI>Agreeables:</HI> I could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing my A|&s;toni&s;hment thereat; whereupon the &s;ame Man, who had given us the abovementioned Informa|tion, in&s;tructed me farther as follows,</P>
<Q><L>Love, <HI>with his Darts does ev'ry Mortal wound,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And as he's the mo&s;t powerful of Kings,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That on Earth, in Sea, or in Heav'n is found,</HI></L>
<L><HI>By various Means all in Subjection brings:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thus 'tis that he, to aggravate the Pains,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of tho&s;e who in&s;olent his Pow'r deride,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Makes them of worthle&s;s Objects wear the Chains</HI></L>
<L><HI>And tremble at that</HI> God <HI>they once defy'd.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Whil&s;t he was thus in&s;tructing me, I was wholly taken up with gazing, with an Attention that is not u&s;ual with me, upon a young Lady, who was
<PB N="6" REF="7">
walking upon the Sea Shore; &s;he was in the Mid&s;t of the <HI>Beauties</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> and eclip&s;ed their Brightne&s;s by the Lu&s;tre of her Charms: I mu&s;t own to you, that &s;he gain'd a Conque&s;t over me at fir&s;t Sight.</P>
<Q><L><HI>For all the various Charms, that can adorn</HI></L>
<L><HI>A blooming Virgin, in her Per&s;on met;</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Milk-white Skin, Cheeks ro&s;y as the Morn,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Mouth with even Rows of Ivory &s;et;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Lips Coral red, and &s;uing to be pre&s;s'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Eyes that would &s;tir an Anchoret's De&s;ire;</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Faultle&s;s Shape, imagine all the Re&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Then &s;ay, who would not at her Feet expire?</HI></L></Q>
<P>In the mean while Ten or a Dozen little Boats loo&s;ed from the Shore; the&s;e Boats were all em|belli&s;h'd with the mo&s;t beauteous Flowers, and their Cordage was of Silk, of a hundred different Colours. Several little <HI>Cupids</HI> were the Rowers to conduct the&s;e Boats, whil&s;t numberle&s;s <HI>Zephyrs</HI> fly|ing round them, and fanning the Flowers con|tinually with their gentle Breezes, filled the Air with an agreeable Odour, and at the &s;ame Time wafted the little Fleet to us in Peace.</P>
<P>When they were come up with our Ve&s;&s;el, we were entertained with an admirable Concert
<PB N="7" REF="8">
of Mu&s;ick, wherein &s;ome exqui&s;ite fine Voices &s;ung as follows,</P>
<Q><L><HI>Ye Mortals, who, inflam'd with am'rous Fires,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Would of this</HI> Life <HI>the choice&s;t Plea&s;ures prove;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Come to our I&s;le, and there have your De&s;ires;</HI></L>
<L><HI>There is no &s;olid Plea&s;ure without Love.</HI></L></Q>
<P>At the &s;ame Time the <HI>Zephyrs</HI> hovering around us, &s;tretched out their Hands, and with a &s;weet Smile &s;eemed to invite us to accompany them. All the&s;e &s;urprizing Wonders had charmed me to &s;uch a Degree, that I was no longer Ma&s;ter of my&s;elf: That inchanting Beauty whom I had &s;een, and whom I burnt with Impatience of Rejoining, with &s;omewhat, I know not what, that &s;eized my Heart at the &s;ame In&s;tant, made me re&s;olve to go a&s;hore upon the I&s;land; accordingly I held out my Hands, and the <HI>Zephyrs</HI> took me up, and carried me into a Boat, where the little <HI>Cupids</HI> received me with a thou&s;and Demon&s;trations of Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal in our Ve&s;&s;el who followed my Example, but there were others likewi&s;e who &s;tay'd behind, and laugh'd at us, in&s;omuch that I was a&s;toni&s;hed at their Inflexibility, when they cry'd after us jearing;</P>
<Q><PB N="8" REF="9">
<L><HI>Go giddy Heads, tho&s;e real Plea&s;ures ta&s;te,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which in</HI> Love<HI>'s Vanities are to be found;</HI></L>
<L><HI>You'll tell your Thoughts thereof, when once they're pa&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>If e'er you '&s;cape from that inchanted Ground.</HI></L></Q>
<P>In the mean While we made the be&s;t of our Way, accompanied with Con&s;orts of Mu&s;ick, and covered with Flowers; and in a little While we got &s;afe a&s;hore.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Soon as one lands, a Godde&s;s charming fair,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Mi&s;tre&s;s of the</HI> Prudent <HI>and</HI> Di&s;creet,</L>
<L>Rea&s;on, <HI>who&s;e Eyes &s;o bright and Piercing are,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ob&s;tructs our pa&s;&s;ing on, and crys,</HI> Retreat.</L>
<L><HI>But oh! the dazzled Sen&s;e denies its Aid,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And hides her beauteous Features from our Eyes;</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Till left amid&s;t her Foes, the charming Maid,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Finds that no Man in Love was ever wi&s;e.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Accordingly I went on without minding her <HI>Preaching,</HI> and ran full of Impatience towards the Place, where I had &s;een the inchanting Creature, who had induced me to land in that Country; but ju&s;t as I approached her, a Man whom I &s;aw near her, &s;truck a Terror into me with a &s;ingle Look. He was tall, and of a good Mein, but very grave and &s;erious; his Eyes were very mode&s;t, and his
<PB N="9" REF="10">
A&s;pect very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and when he looked upon me, he held his Finger upon his Mouth, like the Figure of the God <HI>Silence.</HI> A young Maiden accompanied him, who trode in his very Steps, and mimick'd his every Action and Ge&s;ture, look|ing at every Turn round about her to &s;ee if &s;he was ob&s;erved. A little <HI>Love,</HI> who from that Time devoted him&s;elf to my Service, to bear me Com|pany in my Travels, and to in&s;truct me, gave me the following Information.</P>
<Q><L><HI>He whom you there behold with Looks &s;evere,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is call'd</HI> Re&s;pect, <HI>and is the Child of Love;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Got on</HI> E&s;teem; <HI>great is his Credit here,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Him therefore court, if you'd &s;ucce&s;sful prove:</HI></L>
<L><HI>They who neglect to follow his Advice,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Are very &s;eldom Fav'rites with the</HI> Fair,</L>
<L><HI>To buy his Friend&s;hip,</HI> Silence <HI>is the Price,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And even the Language of the Eyes forbear:</HI></L>
<L><HI>She who &s;o con&s;tant on his Steps does wait,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is call'd</HI> Precaution, <HI>circum&s;pect, and wi&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of di&s;creet Love, th'in&s;eparable Mate,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Love one mu&s;t have every Way one's Eyes.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Being in&s;tructed by &s;uch a good Ma&s;ter, I paid great Civility to <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> and <HI>Precaution,</HI> and de|&s;ired their Friend&s;hip, which they both granted me with a very good Grace: This done, I ad|vanced
<PB N="10" REF="11">
trembling towards the fair One, who had charm'd me, and begged her to do me the Ho|nour to let me hand her, which &s;he granted with Haughtine&s;s enough; and after having talked for &s;ome Time about Things indifferent, &s;he left me and went her Way.</P>
<P>As Night drew on, <HI>Love</HI> conducted me to a little Village, that was very near, where I had a very &s;orry Lodging: This Village is called <HI>Anxi|ety,</HI> from the Name of the Lady of the Mannor, to whom we made a Vi&s;it. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to give you a tolerable De&s;cription of this Wo|man, for &s;he cannot &s;it one Moment in the &s;ame Place, or Po&s;ture: One Minute &s;he is &s;tanding, another Minute &s;he lies down; &s;ometimes &s;he walks a Snail's Pace, at another Time &s;he runs &s;o &s;wift it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep up with her; &s;he never &s;leeps, which makes her very lean and hag|ged; then &s;he is very negligent of her&s;elf, having her Hair always di&s;hevell'd, and in terrible Di&s;|order, but e&s;pecially about her Forehead, by Rea|&s;on &s;he is o&s;ten rubbing it. After having paid my Re&s;pects to her, whereof &s;he took no Manner of Notice, I went to my Lodging, and laid me down upon a Bed, but could get no Re&s;t, the beautiful Charmer being always pre&s;ent in my Thought, which cau&s;ed me to make the following Reflection.</P>
<Q><PB N="11" REF="12">
<L><HI>My Words disjointed are, and wild,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Continual Sighs break off my Speech;</HI></L>
<L><HI>I'm of my Liberty beguil'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And Rea&s;on's Aid in vain be&s;eech.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Has not</HI> Zelinda, <HI>charming Queen,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Bound my Heart Captive in her Chains?</HI></L>
<L><HI>E'er I her beauteous Face had &s;een,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I never felt &s;uch cruel Pains.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Next Morning I aro&s;e very early, and <HI>Love</HI> conducted me to another Village, who&s;e Name is <HI>Court&s;hip;</HI> it is very different from <HI>Anxiety,</HI> being in my Opinion, one of the mo&s;t agreeable Places in the whole Country.</P>
<Q><L><HI>There one may tender Lovers &s;ee,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Crowds flock thither every Day;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Near th'Object of their Vows to be,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And with them &s;port the Time away:</HI></L>
<L><HI>There ev'ry Hou&s;e is deck'd with Flow'rs,</HI></L>
<L><HI>All &s;eems magnificent and gay;</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Fea&s;ts and Balls they &s;pend the Hours,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And Care and Sorrow put away.</HI></L>
<L><HI>All Vice is likewi&s;e bani&s;h'd thence,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor &s;uffered in this ble&s;t Retreat;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ev'n Mi&s;ers lavi&s;h there their Pence,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ble&s;s'd if therewith a Smile they get.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"><HI>Nay, the mo&s;t froward Mortals &s;trive,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Them&s;elves agreeable to make;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And the mo&s;t &s;tupid Sotts alive,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Learn Wit, and off their Folly &s;hake.</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Pen&s;ive too, no longer dumb,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Finds there a Tongue, and talks with Ea&s;e;</HI></L>
<L><HI>In &s;hort there's none who thither come,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But &s;tudy all they can to plea&s;e.</HI></L></Q>
<P>In Effect, there is nothing to be &s;een there but continual Gallantry: Neatne&s;s, Magnificence, Complai&s;ancy, and good Humour re&s;ide there perpetually; in &s;hort, every Thing there is done with the be&s;t Grace in the World.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I arrived there, I found my&s;elf in the mo&s;t complai&s;ant Humour imaginable, be&s;ides which, nothing could be more ingenious at in|venting new Plea&s;ures to divert <HI>Zelinda.</HI> With this De&s;ign, after having dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf very gen|teelly, <HI>Love</HI> conducted me to vi&s;it her, better &s;atisfied with my&s;elf than I had ever before been in my Life; but we were forced at Night to re|turn and lie at <HI>Anxiety,</HI> becau&s;e there is no Lodg|ing to be had at <HI>Court&s;hip,</HI> in&s;omuch that I pa&s;&s;ed that Night again very di&s;agreeably, through my Impatience to &s;ee <HI>Zelinda,</HI> and enjoyed but one Hour's &s;ound Repo&s;e, wherein my &s;leeping Fancy
<PB N="13" REF="14">
entertained me with a Dream, that was perfectly agreeable.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Methought, I &s;aw my charming Dear,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Within my Arms expiring lye;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But &s;he reviv'd more killing Fair,</HI></L>
<L><HI>So &s;weet the Death was &s;he did dye.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Methought I &s;aw a While o'erca&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The wonted Lu&s;tre of her Eyes,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Till langui&s;hing &s;he &s;unk at la&s;t</HI></L>
<L><HI>Upon my Brea&s;t in Exta&s;ies.</HI></L>
<L><HI>But on my waking I perceiv'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Twas all a fleeting Dream, no more;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And griev'd, in Sleep, to be deceiv'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>To wake more wretched than before.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I returned early next Morning to <HI>Court&s;hip,</HI> where I was daily better and better treated by <HI>Zelinda,</HI> in&s;omuch that the Nights, which I was forced to pa&s;s at <HI>Anxiety,</HI> gave me very little Di&s;quiet; but after &s;ome Time, having done all that lay in my Power to appear agreeable in <HI>Ze|linda</HI>'s Eyes, &s;he went one Day to another Vil|lage, which is call'd, <HI>Good Reception,</HI> from the Name of the Lord of the Manor, who is the mo&s;t obliging and mo&s;t complai&s;ant Man in the World: He is mighty ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, and re|ceives every Body very well. The Inhabitants of
<PB N="14" REF="15">
the Place are likewi&s;e mighty civil; and <HI>Zelinda</HI> being willing to be conformable, after the Ex|ample of others, treated me very obligingly, and gave me Room to imagine, by her Behaviour, that &s;he was not at all di&s;plea&s;ed at the Sight of me.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Love</HI> conducted me to <HI>Hope,</HI> where I took up my Lodging, it being a large and beau|tiful City, va&s;tly populous, by Rea&s;on of the daily Arrival of Thou&s;ands, who flock thither from all Parts. Neverthele&s;s, the greate&s;t Part of this City is built upon <HI>Sand,</HI> and without any <HI>Foundation,</HI> which makes it very often fall to Ruin; But the other Part &s;tands upon a pretty good Foundation: for which Rea&s;on, it has almo&s;t, always, conti|nued in its fir&s;t State. This whole City is &s;itu|ated upon the River <HI>Preten&s;ions,</HI> which takes its Ri&s;e from a Mountain of the &s;ame Name, bor|dering upon <HI>Hope.</HI> This River is perfectly plea|&s;ant, but it is dangerous imbarking thereon, which is the very Rea&s;on, why the Hou&s;es built upon its Banks are generally thrown down; but whil&s;t they remain &s;tanding, the fine&s;t Palaces don't e|qual them for Beauty of their Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>This plea&s;ant River is famous for the Ruin of divers illu&s;trious Per&s;ons; neverthele&s;s, I was tempted to bathe my&s;elf therein; and <HI>Love</HI> would have let me plunge in incon&s;iderately enough when I met <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> followed by <HI>Precaution,</HI> who
<PB N="15" REF="16">
&s;top'd me by the Arm, and told me, that it was the ready Way to ruin me, and that I ought to be contented with continuing in <HI>Hope,</HI> without go|ing to expo&s;e my&s;elf in the dangerous River <HI>Pre|ten&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon I thank'd him for his good Advice, and took a Walk towards that Part of the Town which is farthe&s;t from the River: There it is that the Palace of the Prince&s;s <HI>Hope</HI> &s;tands, who is reckoned the Oracle of the I&s;land of <HI>Love,</HI> al|though it is not very &s;afe relying upon what &s;he &s;ays; for,</P>
<Q><L><HI>Fair Promi&s;es &s;he always makes,</HI></L>

<P>By entering her Palace, one meets the <HI>Thoughts,</HI> which are always upon the Wing, and fly &s;ome|times <HI>high,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>low,</HI> and &s;ometimes in the <HI>Middle of the Air;</HI> according as the Fancy takes them; for my Part, I happened upon &s;uch as were di&s;creet enough, for they always kept an even Flight. I went afterwards to &s;ee the Prince&s;s <HI>Hope,</HI> who is actually a very amiable Lady:

She has a perpetual Smile in her Countenance, and a mo&s;t &s;weet, and mo&s;t engaging Look; one is never tired of her Company; &s;he comforts the mo&s;t afflicted, animates the Courage of the Proud, and flatters agreeably tho&s;e who are not unrea&s;on|able in their De&s;ires: when I went to pay her my Re&s;pects, two Men entered her Apartment, at the &s;ame Time, with me; one whereof had placed his Affections on one &s;o much his Superior, that he dur&s;t not promi&s;e him&s;elf any good I&s;&s;ue from his Pa&s;&s;ion; and the other, who was in the &s;ame Ca&s;e, hoped for all Things from his good For|tune!

<P>Hereupon <HI>Re&s;pect</HI> told him that &s;hould not be my Ca&s;e, and that, if I would be advi&s;ed by him, my Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould be &s;oon known without going to <HI>Declaration:</HI> That, as for the re&s;t, I &s;hould al|ways find <HI>Zelinda</HI> at the Place to which he would conduct me, whereas &s;he would, perhaps &s;tay but one Day at <HI>Declaration,</HI> after which I &s;hould ne|ver &s;ee her more.

<P>This Citadel is called <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> from the Name of the Daughter of <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> whom he has made his Deputy, and who commands the Fortre&s;s un|der him. She is a Lady of great Beauty, though not of the Sort that plea&s;es at fir&s;t Sight; but they who are u&s;ed to her Company are very fond of her Conver&s;ation; Her Eyes are inexpre&s;&s;ibly piercing and lively, in&s;omuch, that when they plea&s;e, they can make them&s;elves under&s;tood by every Body; and &s;he has the Look of a Per&s;on of the greate&s;t Mode&s;ty and Re&s;ervedne&s;s, through which, neverthele&s;s, one may di&s;cover abundance of Addre&s;s and Wit, which &s;he never fails to make u&s;e of, whenever &s;he &s;ees Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After paying my Re&s;pects to her, I inquired artfully where <HI>Zelinda</HI> lodged, which, when I was informed, I took up my Quarters in a Hou&s;e that was a good Di&s;tance from thence, and even when I chanced to meet her, all my Di&s;cour&s;e was upon Subjects quite different from Love: Thus did I continue a con&s;iderable Time in the Citadel,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
leading a very mi&s;erable Life, and holding no Cor|re&s;pondence with any.</P>
<Q><L><HI>With falling Tears my Cheeks I &s;tain'd,</HI></L>

<L><HI>But waited with Re&s;pect and Fear,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Till &s;he, or Death, &s;hould end my Pain.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The little <HI>Love,</HI> my Companion, and In&s;truc|tor, took Compa&s;&s;ion on me, and would have left me, but I expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a Value and &s;o much Kindne&s;s for him, that he could not re&s;olve ab&s;olutely upon it.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Time, I became yet more mi&s;erable than ever; for <HI>Zelinda</HI> having di&s;covered my Love by my Actions, removed from thence, and took up her Abode in the Cave of <HI>Cruelty.</HI> This Cave is in the Hole of a Rock, &s;o &s;teep and rug|ged, that it is very difficult to a&s;cend it; the En|trance is forbidden to all Lovers; for which Rea|&s;on there is a &s;trong Guard of Tygers placed at the Mouth, to prevent their getting in. I would have &s;topped <HI>Zelinda,</HI> ju&s;t as &s;he was upon the Point of entering, but was hind'red by a Woman
<PB N="22" REF="23">
of the large&s;t Size, who was very ugly, and had a Savage Look: Her Eyes &s;ticks out of her Head, &s;he has great, lean, long Arms, with prodigious long Nails, like Eagle's Talons; treats every Body with a great deal of Haughtine&s;s and Con|tempt, and takes a Plea&s;ure in torm enting all who approach her; in &s;hort, one, only, of her Looks is enough to cau&s;e De&s;pair.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Her Name is</HI> Cruelty, <HI>Love's deadly Foe,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who&s;e &s;ole Delight's in Mi&s;ery and Woe;</HI></L>
<L><HI>A hideous Mon&s;ter, dreadful to the Sight,</HI></L>

<L><HI>Yet is &s;he join'd, &s;o 'tis decreed by Fate,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To</HI> Youth, <HI>and</HI> Beauty, <HI>as their con&s;tant Mate.</HI></L></Q>
<P>For my Part, I was &s;truck with &s;uch a Ter|ror on her fir&s;t Approach, that not being able to &s;upport her Looks, I withdrew ha&s;tily, and went to the Side of a large Torrent, which falls, with Violence from the Top of the Rock.</P>
<Q><L><HI>From Lovers Eyes, this Torrent takes its Source,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who&s;e &s;treaming Tears, its rapid Channel fill;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And down the Rock precipitates its Cour&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whil&s;t, with its Fall, re&s;ounds each neigh|b'ring Hill.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="24">

<L><HI>Whil&s;t Trees, and Rocks, are melted with the Sound.</HI></L></Q>
<P>This Torrent is &s;urrounded by a very thick and gloomy Fore&s;t, who&s;e Trees all bear the Marks of &s;ome di&s;con&s;olate Lover; their Bark being all full of their melancholy Stones and Complaints; the whole Fore&s;t re&s;ounds with nothing but Cries and Reproaches; and that talkative Nymph, <HI>Ec|cho,</HI> repeats nothing but mournful and lamentable Expo&s;tulations; in &s;hort, one hears nothing but Death talked of in this di&s;mal Place. It was there, that de&s;pairing of being ever able to draw <HI>Zelinda</HI> out of the Arms of <HI>Cruelty,</HI> I frequently cry'd out.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Alas!</HI> Zelinda, <HI>cruel and &s;evere,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Won't Death, at lea&s;t, draw from your Eyes a Tear?</HI></L>
<L><HI>The&s;e Woods, and Rocks, are &s;often'd with my Grief,</HI></L>

<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
Thus did I make all the neighbouring Ecchoes re&s;ound with my Complaints; never having any Re&s;t, nor cea&s;ing from &s;hedding Floods of Tears: My u&s;ual Employment was to walk round the Rock, where I &s;ometimes met <HI>Zelinda,</HI> but &s;he was always in Company with <HI>Cruelty,</HI> whom I endeavour'd in vain to mollify by all Manner of Submi&s;&s;ions. At la&s;t, one Day, when I was in a more de&s;pairing Temper of Mind than I had ever been before, <HI>Love</HI> conducted me to the Side of a certain Lake:</P>

<L><HI>Cea&s;e to be Objects of their Victor's Scorn;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hopele&s;s to be belov'd, worn out with Pain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And having langui&s;h'd Months and Years in vain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Finding their Loves inexorable quite,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And liftle&s;s without them to bear the Light,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thither they come, re&s;olv'd to end the Strife,</HI></L>

Several di&s;con&s;olate Lovers walk along the Sides of the Lake, and I &s;aw &s;ome who threw them|&s;elves into it headlong; I was once tempted to do the &s;ame, but before I attempted to put the de&s;perate De&s;ign in Execution, (a De&s;ign to which Nature is always repugnant) I imagin'd it bet|ter upon &s;econd Thoughts to endeavour once more to mollify <HI>Zelinda,</HI> and that Mon&s;ter <HI>Cru|elty.</HI> To this Purpo&s;e, I went and laid my&s;elf at the Entrance of the Cave, with a firm Re&s;olu|tion never to &s;tir from thence, till I &s;hould &s;ee <HI>Ze|linda</HI> come out. There it was, that by a Flood of Tears, and innumerable heart-breaking Sighs, I made my Complaints heard even to the Bot|tom of the Cave, for which I was frequently very ill u&s;ed by <HI>Cruelty;</HI> In &s;hort, I believe I &s;hould at la&s;t have &s;unk under my Pains, if <HI>Love</HI> had not given me a Piece of very whole&s;ome Coun&s;el, which &s;av'd my Life. One Day, when I was &s;wallow'd up with Grief, I &s;aw a very a|greeable Maiden pa&s;s by me, who &s;hed Tears as &s;he looked upon me, and &s;eem'd by her Counte|nance to be&s;tow tho&s;e Tears upon my Misfor|tunes.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Alas! &s;he &s;eem'd to &s;ay, unhappy Swain!</HI></L>

<HI>Thy tender Pa&s;&s;ion, and thy ardent Love,</HI></L>

<P>I thought my&s;elf &s;o much obliged to this Mai|den, that I a&s;k'd her Name, and <HI>Love</HI> told me that it was <HI>Pity,</HI> who u&s;ed frequently to come thus, and endeavour to oblige &s;ome unfortunate Lover; and that if &s;he wou'd e&s;pou&s;e my Cau&s;e, &s;he wou'd certainly engage <HI>Zelinda</HI> to come out of the Cave of <HI>Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>In order to follow his Coun&s;el, I endeavour'd to prevail upon <HI>Pity,</HI> by letting her know my deplorable Condition, which &s;he was &s;o much moved with, that &s;he promis'd to u&s;e her ut|mo&s;t Efforts to a&s;&s;i&s;t me: Accordingly it was not long before &s;he made me &s;en&s;ible of the good Effects of her Promi&s;es; for taking a Turn round the Rock &s;he at la&s;t di&s;cover'd <HI>Zelinda,</HI> and with Tears in her Eyes gave her an Account of my melancholy Condition, and that in &s;uch moving Language that it drew likewi&s;e Tears from the beauteous Eyes of the inhuman Fair One. <HI>Pity</HI> finding &s;he had moved her Compa&s;&s;ion, conducted her to the Place where I lay, and &s;hew'd her the mi&s;erable State to which &s;he had reduced me; <HI>Zelinda</HI> could not help being &s;en&s;ibly affected with the melancholy Sight, and accordingly, not only began to give Ear to my amorous Reproaches,

Notwith&s;tanding his Incivi|lity I cou'd not help re&s;pecting him, and as I wou'd have appeas'd him, without de&s;igning to look upon me, he led <HI>Zelinda</HI> a quite contrary Way, and all &s;he cou'd do was to cry out,</P>
<Q><L>Strephon, <HI>farewell, I dare no longer &s;tay,</HI></L>

<P><PB N="31" REF="32">
I remain'd immoveable at this Sight, and &s;aw her go away without &s;peaking one Word; how|ever, after &s;ome He&s;itation, my fir&s;t Re&s;olution was to run after her, and wre&s;t her from the Arms of <HI>Duty</HI> by main Force; but <HI>Re&s;pect,</HI> and <HI>Precaution,</HI> who happen'd to come by very &s;ea|&s;onably, prevented me: This accidental Meeting anger'd me at the fir&s;t, but I had always reap'd &s;o much Benefit by their Advice, that I was re|&s;olved &s;till to follow it.</P>
<P>Hereupon I retired to a neighbouring De&s;art, which &s;eemed agreeable to my Humour: 'I'is a large Valley, &s;urrounded with &s;everal Mountains, and very remote from all Manner of Corre&s;pon|dence, where there is a Ca&s;tle &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of a great Wood, which is the continual Abode of a melancholy Female, called, <HI>Ab&s;ence:</HI> She is very &s;eldom to be &s;een, having her Eyes always drowned in Tears, and being con&s;equently very much dejected, and disfigured: She is always in Mourning, and perpetually accompanied by <HI>Thoughtfulne&s;s,</HI> who is al&s;o mighty lean, never fixing her Eyes long upon any &s;ingle Object, but looking upon every Thing, and yet &s;eeing No|thing: She takes no Notice, nor gives the lea&s;t Attention to any Thing; neither does &s;he ever &s;peak, but quite foreign to the Purpo&s;e, and hardly ever gives an An&s;wer to what is asked of her; in

&s;hort, &s;he &s;eems to be collected within her&s;elf, and to love no Company but her own. The Fall of Waters, and their &s;oft Murmers, and the &s;inging of Birds, are her ordinary Diver&s;ions. Hereupon I entered into a &s;trict Friend&s;hip with her, and conformed my&s;elf entirely to her Manner of living; retiring, with my Sorrows to the greate&s;t Solitudes, and conver&s;ing alone, in the &s;ame Manner as &s;he, with the Woods, the Brooks, the Ecchoes, and the Springs.</P>
<P>In the mean while I &s;uffered a Thou&s;and af|flicting Torments, having always a longing De&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>Zelinda,</HI> and not being able to &s;atisfy that De&s;ire; what I thought mo&s;t grievous of all, in that Place, was, that the Time is longer than in any other Place in the World, the Moments being Hours, the Hours Days, and the Days Years: Be&s;ides this, one meets every where with <HI>Troubles,</HI> which are great gigantick Mortals of a very di&s;|agreeable A&s;pect; and they are &s;o numerous that there's no avoiding them. At la&s;t, being weary of living in &s;uch cruel Torment, and ready to &s;ink under it, I compo&s;ed the following Ver&s;es.</P>
<Q><L><HI>'Tis then decreed above, that I mu&s;t dye,</HI></L>

<L><HI>By various Pa&s;&s;ions to&s;s'd, my wounded Soul,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To each is made a Prey, without Controul.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of my once plea&s;ing Flame, nought now remains,</HI></L>

This made me, in a Moment, forget all my pa&s;t Pains, and run to &s;ee her again with all the Impatience of an ardent Lover; but I was not much happier for the Change of my Condition; for I found her in a Place, where no one yet ever enjoyed any Repo&s;e.</P>

I felt within my&s;elf a &s;ecret Hatred, and Aver&s;ion to them all; and a little after, thinking, that <HI>Zelinda</HI> looked upon them too kindly, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be con|ducted by <HI>Love</HI> to the Palace of <HI>Jealou&s;y,</HI> which is adjacent to the <HI>Rivals.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
This Palace is yet a much more di&s;agreeable Place than any of the re&s;t; for even <HI>Ab&s;ence</HI> and <HI>Cruelty</HI> don't make one &s;uffer half the Ills, that one &s;uffers in <HI>Jealou&s;y:</HI> Continual Winds, Rains, and Tempe&s;ts, render this a very unplea&s;ant Place to re&s;ide in; the Thunder growls there perpetu|ally over one's Head, and the Sky is very dark, and multiplies every Object; the lea&s;t Shaddow &s;trikes one there with Terrour, and the whole Place is full of Precipices, where People are often lo&s;t, by Rea&s;on of the Darkne&s;s that reigns through|out the Whole.</P>
<P>At the Entrance of this Palace, We meet with <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion, Idle Fancies,</HI> and <HI>Perturbation of Mind,</HI> which bewitch the Eyes in &s;uch a Manner, that one &s;ees every Thing the wrong Way. <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> is always in a Fury, without knowing any Rea&s;on why, &s;peaks very precipitately, and &s;ays every Thing unrea&s;onably, and without any Order or Connection: <HI>Perturbation of Mind</HI> is &s;tartled and di&s;turbed at the lea&s;t Thing in the World, and is a&s;toni&s;hed at a meer Nothing; And <HI>Idle Fancies</HI> are always creating their own Misfortunes, becau&s;e they form to them&s;elves vain Phantoms, which prove their own Torment.

<P>In this mi&s;erable State I went to vi&s;it <HI>Jea|lou&s;y,</HI> who is very ugly, and very lean, be&s;ides her being cover'd with Serpents, which are perpetually gnawing her Entrails. Her Look is full of Horrour, and &s;he &s;ees not any Thing which &s;he does not envy.

When I met <HI>Zelinda</HI> in Company, I dur&s;t not approach her, and trembled in my very Soul, but then I endeavour'd to overhear what was &s;aid to her, and her An&s;wers, and I wre&s;ted every Word &s;he &s;poke to &s;uch a Sen&s;e as might torment my &s;elf. When any one whi&s;per'd her, I turn'd as pale as Death immediately, and interpreted the lea&s;t Action, and the lea&s;t Ge&s;ture in Favour of others; and when I did not &s;ee her, I imagin'd her in the Arms of &s;ome happier Rival: If &s;he was alone, I fancy'd &s;he was waiting for &s;ome Body; in &s;hort in my Phrenzy I was jealous of

<P>In the mean While, <HI>Zelinda,</HI> who &s;aw my Weakne&s;s, did but &s;mile at it, at the Beginning; but afterwards &s;he re&s;ented it highly, and then it was that I became acquainted with a Man who would have cured me, both of my <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Jea|lou&s;y,</HI> at the &s;ame Time; his Name was <HI>Spite.</HI></P>

At la&s;t my Tears and Intreaties, together with the natural Inclination &s;he had for me, as &s;he had confe&s;s'd to me at <HI>Confidence,</HI> prevail'd on her to receive me again into Favour: In &s;hort, after many Difficulties, We arrived at the Metropolis of the Kingdom of <HI>Love,</HI> which is call'd after the Name of the I&s;land, and where the Court is kept, which is beyond Expre&s;&s;ion &s;plendid and agreeable; being compo&s;ed of all Sorts of Nati|ons, Ranks, and Degrees, Kings, Princes, and Subjects; notwith&s;tanding which, no one there is a greater Man than another.</P>
<P>This City is very large, and every Thing there is in Confu&s;ion; Per&s;ons of Merit are join'd there very often with tho&s;e who have none; and &s;uch as are hand&s;ome frequently leave all for tho&s;e that are homely; which &s;ufficiently &s;hews that the God who pre&s;ides there is blind.

of parting with hers, but <HI>De&s;ire</HI> at la&s;t &s;natch'd it away, not without &s;ome little Violence.

<Q><L><HI>And, which perhaps, may &s;eem mo&s;t &s;trange,</HI></L>

<P>I mu&s;t own to You that one is very happy in that Place; as for my Part, when I con&s;ider'd that I was arrived at the Height of all my Wi&s;hes, I thought I cou'd never be &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy'd with my good Fortune; but my Happine&s;s was too great to be la&s;ting, accordingly I &s;oon &s;aw the End of it, as you will ob&s;erve: But &s;ome Days before, as I was walking, I met with a Maiden who was but homely, but who was never|thele&s;s very affected, and never &s;atisfy'd with any Thing. She has no &s;ettled Abode, becau&s;e &s;he takes no Care to provide her&s;elf of any one, even the mo&s;t agreeable Things being irk&s;ome to her, her Name is <HI>Coldne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>She has a great Power in the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Love;</HI> for they who will hearken to her Coun&s;el, &s;oon leave it without any Trouble or Regret, for &s;he con|ducts them to the Bay of <HI>Di&s;gu&s;t,</HI> where there are but too many Ve&s;&s;els ready to carry one away. I &s;aw &s;everal who went along with her, but I thought her &s;o homely and &s;o unrea&s;onable, that
<PB N="47" REF="48">
I wou'd not &s;tay one Moment with her, but re|turn'd to the Palace of <HI>True Plea&s;ure,</HI> where &s;ome Days after I met with a Misfortune, which &s;till makes a deep Impre&s;&s;ion upon me, and which I never expect to &s;ee an End of.</P>
<P>One Morning in the Mid&s;t of all my Plea&s;ures, I &s;aw a Man who came &s;aucily to interrupt them; his Mien was maje&s;tick and independent, and his Look haughty; and by his Eyes, and the whole Air of his Face one might &s;ee that he was one that was ab&s;olute, and knew not what it was to obey. In a Word, it was <HI>De&s;tiny,</HI> who&s;e Decrees are irrevocable, who forced <HI>Zelinda</HI> from my Arms. All my Efforts to detain her were in vain, he took her away, and carried her I know not whither, for I have not been able to hear of her &s;ince.</P>
<P>Hereupon I immediately left the Palace of <HI>True Plea&s;ure,</HI> which &s;eem'd di&s;agreeable to me, &s;ince <HI>Zelinda</HI> was no longer there, and retired to the Place where I now am, and where I believe I &s;hall pa&s;s tho&s;e few remaining Days which my Sorrows will allow me. I am here upon the Top of a Mountain call'd the <HI>De&s;art of Remembrance;</HI> its Solitude is very agreeable, but what is very vexatious is, that the Place is &s;o high that it over|looks the whole <HI>I&s;land of Love;</HI> in&s;omuch that one has always one's Misfortune before one's Eyes,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
and can't help &s;eeing the Places through which one has pa&s;s'd, and this it is that makes me mi&s;e|rable, for which Way &s;oever I turn, I find al|ways &s;ome Objects which recall my pa&s;t Hap|pine&s;s to my Remembrance.</P>
<P>I have now langui&s;h'd here for &s;ome Time, and at la&s;t con&s;ider'd that you wou'd have &s;ome Rea&s;on to complain of me, dear <HI>Bellamour,</HI> if I did not let you hear from me before my Death.

<HEAD>A MAP OF THE ISLAND of MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Country which I am going to de|&s;cribe to you, is an I&s;land of a va&s;t Ex|tent, and indi&s;putably the mo&s;t populous of any Country in the Univer&s;e. There is no Po&s;|&s;ibility of entering it, but in Couples, a Man and a Woman, whence it happens, that there is always an equal Number of both Sexes therein: For, no &s;ooner has any one &s;et his Foot in it, but there is a &s;trong Guard placed continually at the Mouths of the Harbours, which prevents all Per&s;ons what&s;oever, from &s;tirring from thence, but on Con|dition of having their Partners carried to the Grave, and being them&s;elves tran&s;ported to the <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> of <HI>Widowhood,</HI> which is at one of the Ends of the I&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="51">
Nor is this Precaution needle&s;s; for were it not for the&s;e Guards, this I&s;land, as populous as it is, would &s;oon be a meer De&s;ert; for, notwith&s;tanding Thou&s;ands of Strangers are flocking thither every Day from all Parts, being induced thereunto by the Spirit of Curio&s;ity, the fir&s;t Ruin of Mankind, it is very certain that mo&s;t of the Inhabitants would &s;oon &s;warm out again by Millions, did not the&s;e numerous Guards render it impracticable.</P>
<P>There is no Way to arrive at this va&s;t Region, but by two Ports; the one whereof is called <HI>In|tere&s;t,</HI> and the other <HI>Love.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e is a <HI>trading Port,</HI> full of immen&s;e Riches, where <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Mothers</HI> keep a <HI>perpetual Fair,</HI> to <HI>put off</HI> their <HI>Daughters,</HI> who are &s;et out for Sale in their Warehou&s;es, and are di&s;po&s;ed of for good round Sums in ready Money. But there is one Thing very particular in the Way of trading of the&s;e Gentry; for whereas other Dealers expect Money in Return for their Goods, the&s;e give a hand&s;ome Price to tho&s;e who will take their Mer|chandize off their Hands. The Port of <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> is <HI>open</HI> on all Sides, and one may enter it with any Wind.</P>
<P>The other is a mo&s;t agreeable Port, abounding with all imaginable Plea&s;ures: The People live there in a perpetual Spring, and the Trees, which are ever green, are always full of Birds, which
<PB N="3" REF="52">
make the Air re&s;ound with their Love in&s;piring Harmony. The only Wind that carries into this Port, is a gentle Gale called <HI>Sighs,</HI> and one al|ways enters therein with Delight; but very often before one can get in, there ari&s;es <HI>&s;udden Hurri|canes,</HI> which come from the high Mountain of <HI>Parents,</HI> drive the Ve&s;&s;els back into open Sea, and prevent their putting into Port. Neverthele&s;s when the above-mentioned Gale is good, and per&s;everes con&s;tantly in blowing from the Region of <HI>Sighs,</HI> it &s;eldom fails of getting the better of <HI>the&s;e Hur|ricanes,</HI> and bringing Pa&s;&s;engers &s;afe into Har|bour.</P>
<P>When one comes fir&s;t within Sight of this I&s;land, and takes a View of it afar off, before one's entering the Port, nothing can &s;eem either more inviting, or more agreeable. One is entertain'd on all Sides with enchanting Pro&s;pects, that form beautiful Land&s;kips to di&s;tant Beholders, and de|ceive the Eye mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly; but no &s;ooner has one once &s;et Foot a&s;hore, but in Proportion as one advances up into the Country, one perceives that tho&s;e Plains, which &s;eemed before, when at a Di&s;tance, to be covered with a lively Verdure, to be enamelled with Flowers, and to flouri&s;h with all the Beauties of the jolly Spring, are over|&s;pread with Briars and Thorns, and full of dark and melancholly Vales, divided by Torrents, and
<PB N="4" REF="53">
Precipices, abounding with intricate and perplex|ing Roads, that are cro&s;&s;ed by Mora&s;&s;es, which render them unpa&s;&s;able. One finds al&s;o that tho&s;e beautiful ri&s;ing Grounds, which one fancied co|vered with little verdant Groves, are nothing but Heaps of &s;teep Rocks, between the mournful Cy|pre&s;&s;es, which over&s;hade them; be&s;ides which, they are full of wild Bea&s;ts, Dragons, and Ser|pents.</P>
<P>Thus 'tis evident that this I&s;land affords two very different Pro&s;pects; one, which is very agreeable, to tho&s;e who have not yet &s;et Foot thereon, and only view it at a Di&s;tance; and another, which is highly di&s;agreeable, to tho&s;e who have run them|&s;elves wilfully into that Confinement, and who are no &s;ooner inthralled therein, but they offer up their mo&s;t ardent Vows, for that dear Liberty, which they have given up &s;o imprudently; in&s;o|much that it is ju&s;t the &s;ame with them, as with the Goldfinch and the Cage.</P>

<P>The Inhabitants of this I&s;land are at perpetual War with tho&s;e of the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Amathontis,</HI> or of <HI>Lovers,</HI> which lies very near them: I &s;hall de|&s;cribe in the Sequel, after what Manner their Wars are carried on; but fir&s;t, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a De&s;cription of the different Inhabitants of the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Marriage.</HI></P>

<P>Not but that there have &s;ometimes been Tra|vellers, who have been &s;o curious as to take a Trip thither either out of a Frolick, or out of Love, and have obtained Admittance there by &s;ome Stratagem: But neverthele&s;s they have not been able to effect this, without embroiling them|&s;elves with the Courts of Ju&s;tice, and unle&s;s one has as much Gold to throw away as my Lord <HI>M&mdash;d,</HI> one runs the Hazzard of taking a Voy|age with Count <HI>Cahoon,</HI> to the <HI>Chequer-Inn,</HI> in <HI>Newgate-Street.</HI></P>

<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Marriage</HI> is divided into five Provinces, which have each of them a Capital City, and &s;everal little Towns dependent thereon. Four of the&s;e Provinces extend them&s;elves along the four Sea Coa&s;ts, but the large&s;t, which is chief|ly peopled by the Colonies that flock thither from the other four, is in the Center of the I&s;land, the Government whereof it has u&s;urped, through the prodigious Number of its Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The four Provinces which lye along the Sea Coa&s;ts, are inhabited by the <HI>Di&s;creet,</HI> the <HI>Ill-match|ed,</HI> the <HI>Ill-at-Ea&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Jealous:</HI> The Head Province, which is in the Middle, is the famous <HI>Cuckold&s;hire,</HI> who&s;e Capital is the well-known <HI>Hornborough.</HI> But be&s;ides the&s;e five Provinces, there are likewi&s;e two <HI>Penin&s;ulas,</HI> the one of <HI>Widowhood,</HI> and the other of <HI>Divorce,</HI> which have taken up two Necks of Land, at two Ends of this I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Province of the <HI>Di&s;creet,</HI> who were formerly called the <HI>Faithful,</HI> extends it&s;elf along the whole
<PB N="8" REF="57">
<HI>Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t.</HI> Its Capital City is called <HI>Sophia;</HI> its Buildings are mode&s;t and regular, its Fortifica|tions good, and capable of making a re&s;olute De|fence; it is water'd by <HI>Cha&s;tity,</HI> which is a River, who&s;e pure Stream flows &s;oftly, and without Noi&s;e, although in its Cour&s;e, it is enlarged by the Wa|ters of four Rivulets, called <HI>Piety, Au&s;terity, Mora|lity,</HI> and <HI>Vigilance:</HI> The&s;e have nothing agreeable in them, becau&s;e they only run in Meanders, and their Sides are every where covered with Briars, and Thickets, which prevent the Incur&s;ions of the Scouts of <HI>Amathontis,</HI> who might otherwi&s;e at|tempt to land there.</P>
<P>The Governour of this City is <HI>Prince Integrity,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Honour</HI> is the Civil Magi&s;trate; their Churches are always open, they live there with Frugality, and enjoy no Plea&s;ures but what are in|nocent. The Publick Walks where they take the Air, are all planted with <HI>Linden</HI> Trees, that are &s;prung from tho&s;e into which <HI>Baucis</HI> and <HI>Philemon</HI> were changed; and all their Fences are Palli&s;adoes of <HI>Laurel,</HI> &s;prung from the <HI>cha&s;t Daphne.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s as delightful and well governed as this City is, one can &s;carcely imagine how very few Inhabitants there are therein; and were it not for the <HI>Prudes,</HI> who have found the Means to get Admittance into it, under the borrowed Ma&s;k of Virtue, this Province would be almo&s;t a De&s;art.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="58">
The&s;e <HI>Prudes</HI> then po&s;&s;e&s;s the large&s;t Part of this City, and inhabit a Quarter, which is &s;epa|rated from the others by the <HI>Ob&s;cure,</HI> a little Ri|ver over&s;haded with Trees, which &s;hield it from the Beams of the Sun, and di&s;embogues it&s;elf in|to the <HI>Black Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Their Hou&s;es on the Out&s;ide, are not to be di|&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the <HI>Di&s;creet;</HI> but when my Lord <HI>Honour</HI> goes from Time to Time, and makes a narrow In&s;pection into the In&s;ide of their Tenements, he finds &s;o va&s;t a Difference between their outward Appearance, and their Management within Doors, that he is often forced to bani&s;h them, and to &s;end large Colonies of them to peo|ple the Head Province.</P>
<P>The Metropolis being &s;o poorly inhabited, it may be well thought that the Country-Towns and Villages are yet wor&s;e. In effect, one meets only with a few &s;cattered up and down, and almo&s;t without Inhabitants; and even the&s;e are of &s;uch a churli&s;h untractable Temper, that a Pa&s;&s;enger is hard put to it to find a Lodging.</P>
<P>Although tho&s;e who are really <HI>di&s;creet,</HI> are <HI>haughty</HI> and <HI>re&s;erved,</HI> they behave them&s;elves with yet le&s;s Haughtine&s;s than the <HI>Prudes;</HI> there are no People in the World who extol their own Me|rit to &s;uch a Degree as they, or make &s;uch a Noi&s;e about their Virtue, in&s;omuch that they treat all
<PB N="10" REF="59">
their Neighbours with the utmo&s;t Contempt: But although they affect to &s;eem wonderfully intrepid, and to be eager for the Combat, they often prove not to be &s;o brave, as they would be thought by their Di&s;cour&s;e; and the <HI>Amathontins</HI> &s;eldom at|tempt to invade their Territories, without making con&s;iderable Havock among them.</P>
<P>Even among&s;t the real <HI>Di&s;creet,</HI> one may find two different Sorts; one of the&s;e are &s;o through a Principle of Honour, and are always as chearful, as they are invincible; but there are others, who&s;e Cha&s;tity is more owing to their Vanity, than their Virtue; the&s;e have always a &s;ullen Gravity in their Looks, which &s;ufficiently demon&s;trates, that they are not at all plea&s;ed with their Condition.</P>
<P>As little inhabited as the Country is, and as &s;evere as the Laws of their Government are, it does not prevent &s;ome, and tho&s;e even of the <HI>mo&s;t Di&s;creet,</HI> from removing daily into the Head Pro|vince; for, in &s;hort, Virtue, as well as the Mind, grows weary of too inten&s;e an Application to one Point, and is apt to abate of its fir&s;t Severity; but tho&s;e who &s;tay behind, look upon the&s;e De&s;erters with Contempt, for which Rea&s;on, they have &s;et up the following In&s;cription over the Front of their principal Gate.</P>

It is watered by two Rivers, one whereof is called the <HI>Fanta&s;que,</HI> and the other the <HI>Clande&s;tine:</HI> The one is a River con&s;i&s;ting wholly of Ca&s;cades, and hurrying every Moment with Violence, down Precipices; and the other a rapid Torrent, which being a&s;hamed of &s;howing it&s;elf, runs
<PB N="12" REF="61">
impetuou&s;ly under Ground, but notwith&s;tanding the Care it takes to hide its Cour&s;e, cannot pre|vent its being di&s;covered, by a hollow Noi&s;e it makes in flowing.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as one has &s;et Foot within the Gates of this City, one hears nothing but the Cries and Complaints of Children, whom either an old Mo|ther has &s;acrificed to a young Rake, or whom an old Debauchee has given up as Victims to a young Coquet. Here the Ma&s;ter of a Family marries his Cook-Maid, and there an old Beldame of Qua|lity takes to Hu&s;band her <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> and &s;olemnizes in her own Chapel a Ceremony, which &s;erves only to add fre&s;h Shame to her Licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>At the Gates of this City grows that famous Wood, mentioned by the bantering Doctor in the Play. The Trees, he &s;ays of this Wood, bear the Heads of all Sorts of Iron Tools, and the Earth underneath produces proper Handles wherewith to fit them up; but it often happens, that when the Iron is at full Growth, and falls, in&s;tead of meeting with a Handle that would be proper for it, it drops upon one that matches it mo&s;t prepo|&s;terou&s;ly: For In&s;tance, the Head of a Scythe falls upon the Handle of a Pike, the Head of a Hal|berd upon the Helve of a Hatchet, and &s;o of all

the re&s;t, in&s;omuch that not one of them meets with a Handle &s;uitable to its Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is ju&s;t the &s;ame Ca&s;e with tho&s;e who make Matches &s;o di&s;proportionable, either for Age or Quality, that they only render them&s;elves a Laugh|ing Stock to every one who hears thereof; I would have all Per&s;ons therefore remember this as an infallible Truth:</P>

<P>For although it is a very common Saying, and almo&s;t grown into a Proverb, <HI>That Love will unite the mo&s;t di&s;tant Extreams in its Center;</HI> it is only in Love-Affairs that this Union mu&s;t be under|&s;tood to be effected with Plea&s;ure; but when the indi&s;&s;oluble Tye of Matrimony is in the Ca&s;e, the Proverb will be found no longer to hold good.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Southern Coa&s;t</HI> of this I&s;land, is the Province of the <HI>Ill-at-Ea&s;e,</HI> who&s;e Capital City is <HI>Short-Allowance,</HI> under the Command of Colo|nel <HI>Hard-Fare.</HI> The Inhabitants of this Country are melancholly and fretful; the Hou&s;es are but Cottages, which the Want of Belly-Timber un|furni&s;hes by little and little; the Kitchens all lye

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this mi&s;erable Want of nece&s;|&s;ary Provi&s;ion, mo&s;t Part of the Inhabitants, and e&s;pecially the Women, will cheat their Bellies of the little they can afford, to be&s;tow it upon a de|ceitful Dre&s;s, which conceals their inward Nece&s;|&s;ities under a Di&s;gui&s;e of an ea&s;y Out&s;ide: But this De&s;ire of Finery, beyond what they can af|ford, and the Cries of a half-&s;tarved Belly, makes the&s;e Inhabitants leave this mi&s;erable Country with Plea&s;ure, and flock in large Colonies, to People the Head Province, and endeavour to help the Barrenne&s;s of their Lands by the kindly Showers of Gold that fall from the Pockets of their Lovers.</P>

On the <HI>Northern Coa&s;t</HI> of the <HI>I&s;le of Marriage</HI> lies the Province of the <HI>Jealous,</HI> who&s;e Capital City is &s;ituated on the Middle of Mount <HI>Chi|maera,</HI> ju&s;t in that Part which the Antients &s;aid was inhabited by <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Goats,</HI> the Top being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Lions, and the Bottom by Serpents; which gave Ri&s;e to the Fable of its being an Ani|mal compo&s;ed of three Natures.

<P>The Capital City, altho' &s;ituated on the Side of a Hill, &s;tands neverthele&s;s in a very ob&s;cure Place, and is over&s;hadowed with Mountains on every Side.

<P>The Streets of this City are extreamly light|&s;ome, and very &s;trait, to the End that one may be able to have a clear View of all that is tran&s;|acted therein, from one End to the other; but the Hou&s;es are extreamly dark, having but few Win|dows, and tho&s;e very &s;mall, and cro&s;s barr'd: The Inhabitants are mighty grave, and hold very little Corre&s;pondence with their Neighbours.</P>
<P>Although the City be pretty Populous, one &s;ees very few Folks in the Streets, and the Hu&s;bands beat the Tat-Too very early, to call their Wives

home in good Time, before the Du&s;k of the Evening expo&s;es them to any Surprize: They are an odd &s;ort of Mortals; they are perpetually upon Thorns, and one may &s;ee them hurry out, and return in again, every Minute, with the utmo&s;t Abruptne&s;s, their Eyes &s;taring all the while, and their Ears pricked up, with the utmo&s;t Attention and Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>They apply to them&s;elves every Word that is &s;poken; and tremble at the Sight of a Man of Gallantry, as much as a Dove at the Sight of a Hawk: Then it is that they are very diverting, by the Ridiculou&s;ne&s;s and Folly of their Unea&s;i|ne&s;s; which is &s;o far from being of any Service to them, that they them&s;elves contribute mo&s;t to the Succe&s;s of their Enemies Affairs, by their per|petual teazing and provoking tho&s;e, whom they would defend from their Attacks: Since it is certain that nothing contributes more to the Con|que&s;t of a Gallant, than the Rea&s;ons one gives a Wife to revenge her&s;elf of one's ill U&s;age; and I have known tho&s;e who&s;e Plea&s;ure has received a more exqui&s;ite Reli&s;h, by the extravagant Hu|mours and Caprices of a jealous Cuckold.</P>

<P>Hereupon one of the Inhabitants, who having a Flea in his Ear, happened to ri&s;e earlier than the Re&s;t, and had &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s in that Square; went thither, found the&s;e Ver&s;es, tore them down that In&s;tant, hurried Home directly with all Speed, and thre&s;h'd his Wife mo&s;t enormou&s;ly: This done, he handed them about very carefully from Door to Door among&s;t all his Neighbours; who taking each of them, the Thing to him&s;elf, treated his Rib ju&s;t in the &s;ame Manner as the fir&s;t Cox|comb; but notwith&s;tanding all the Vigilance of

<P>I have already ob&s;erved that this City is wa|tered by the River <HI>Anxiety,</HI> which is a large Ri|ver, navigable from its very Spring.

The City is extreamly &s;trong and inacce&s;&s;ible; the Walls, which are at lea&s;t as thick as tho&s;e built by <HI>Semiramis,</HI> are &s;urrounded on all Sides by this deep River; &s;o that there is no approaching the City, but by a Bridge that is laid over the River, beyond which is a narrow Cau&s;ey, fortified by &s;ix &s;trong Batteries, well guard|ed, which lead up to the only Gate there is, in&s;omuch that no <HI>Amathontin</HI> can pa&s;s, but by the Help of &s;ome Di&s;gui&s;e.

<P>The Capital of this Province, is called <HI>Horn|borough,</HI> and is at lea&s;t as large as <HI>London,</HI> to which it bears a very great Re&s;emblance; but like the ancient <HI>Thebes,</HI> it has an Hundred Gates, that it may be able to give Entrance to the prodi|gious Concour&s;e of New-comers, who daily flock thither from all Parts: All the World having a Title to a Freedom there, from the greate&s;t Em|peror to the mo&s;t Scoundrel Blackguard; and as &s;oon as his Spou&s;e plea&s;es, the Hu&s;band puts in his Claim, and enters into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in Right of his Wife. In &s;hort, this City, and indeed the whole Province has the &s;ame Property as the <HI>Sea</HI> and the <HI>Gallows,</HI> for it <HI>refu&s;es none,</HI> from the <HI>Prince</HI> to the <HI>Beggar.</HI> It has been ob&s;erved indeed by &s;ome, in Exception to this, that there never was <HI>Pope, Cardinal, Je&s;uit,</HI> nor <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> in all this Pro|vince, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e they don't care for the Company of People of &s;uch bad Principles; but then, to make Amends, there have been abun|dance of Ro&s;y-cheek'd Prote&s;tant Divines, e&s;pe|cially <HI>A&mdash;b&mdash;ps, B&mdash;p&mdash;s,</HI> and <HI>dignified Clergy|men,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="71">
again&s;t whom no Exception has ever been made, they being always very welcome Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>This City is &s;ituated in the Mid&s;t of a large and fertile Plain, abounding with all the Plea|&s;ures and Delicacies that can be wi&s;hed for in Life; the <HI>Pactolus</HI> runs quite through the Mid&s;t of it, and its fruitful Streams, which abound with golden Sand, divide it exactly in two. My Lord <HI>Ready-Money,</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> and for|merly Vice-Roy of <HI>Peru,</HI> is Governor thereof; the <HI>Jupiters</HI> al&s;o of the <HI>Trea&s;ury,</HI> who can con|vert them&s;elves into <HI>Golden Showers,</HI> bear great Sway there, it being from their powerful Body that the Magi&s;tracy are yearly cho&s;e; for which Rea&s;on they have cau&s;ed the following In&s;crip|tion to be &s;et over the Front of their Town-Hall.</P>

<P>Each Side of the <HI>Pactolus</HI> is divided into two Quarters; in&s;omuch that the whole City con|&s;i&s;ts of four Parts, inhabited by four Sorts of Ci|tizens, who from their different Characters are called by different Names: The&s;e are, the <HI>Content|ed,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="72">

<P>The <HI>Contented Cuckolds</HI> dwell in a Quarter which they have named the <HI>Land of Plenty;</HI> they are a good Sort of People, with whom a Man may do what he will, and who withdraw com|modiou&s;ly, and without Noi&s;e, as &s;oon as ever a Lover appears. They would be very &s;orry ever to interrupt the Plea&s;ures of tho&s;e who do them the Honour to vi&s;it their Wives: Their Word of Battle is, <HI>Let Plea&s;ure be free, I con&s;ent.</HI> This jovial Humour is vi&s;ible in all their Looks, Words, and Actions: there is nothing to be &s;een at their Hou&s;es but Dancing and Fea&s;ting perpetually, O|peras, Balls, Ma&s;querades, Hunting Matches, and Parties of Plea&s;ure, of all which they are &s;ure to be Partakers. The City is neither fortified with Walls, Gates, or Draw-Bridges, on their Side: among&s;t them every one lives without Con&s;traint, and without Jealou&s;y; their only Care being af|ter what Manner they &s;hall divert them&s;elves, provided it is at the Expence of the <HI>Amathontins;</HI> who are never better plea&s;ed than when they are among the&s;e good People, although they ne|ver fail to &s;end them by Degrees to an Ho&s;pital, in order to make Room for others: For Lovers are, in one Re&s;pect, like Fi&s;h, <HI>the fre&s;he&s;t are al|ways the be&s;t.</HI> And to the End that no Body

<P>Over again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Contented Cuckolds,</HI> and on the other Side of a large Brook that parts them,
<PB N="25" REF="74">
are the <HI>Frantick Cuckolds,</HI> who have taken up their Re&s;idence in that Quarter of the Town where <HI>Cuckoldom</HI> has erected her <HI>Bedlam.</HI></P>
<P>This Quarter which is called the Quarter of the <HI>Pazzi,</HI> is inhabited by tho&s;e Fools, who take a Plea&s;ure in publi&s;hing their own Shame, in mak|ing the Courts of Ju&s;tice ring with their ridicu|lous Complaints, and diverting the Publick with the continual Farce of their Extravagancies. All their Recreation is in bedaubing them&s;elves with Filth, and giving them&s;elves abundance of Trouble, and that at a va&s;t Charge, in order to convince the Courts of Ju&s;tice of their having &s;uffered a Di&s;|grace, which they ought rather, if po&s;&s;ible, to endeavour to unknow them&s;elves, and with the Fruits of which the hone&s;t Lawyers fea&s;t them|&s;elves very merrily.</P>
<P>The&s;e extravagant Wretches are divided into two Cla&s;&s;es, whereof the one have taken up their Quarters in the Ho&s;pital of the <HI>Curables;</HI> the&s;e are &s;uch, as after a fruitle&s;s Clamour, which has rendered them for &s;ome Time the Talk and Je&s;t of the Town, begin to recover their Sen&s;es, and &s;ay, that all Things rightly con&s;idered, taking one Woman with another, they &s;till like their own Wives be&s;t.</P>
<P>The others, who are lodged in a different, and yet le&s;s agreeable Quarter, are tho&s;e <HI>incurable Lu|naticks,</HI>

who under the Direction of a <HI>hornified</HI> Phy&s;ician, ride full Speed to lay their Bones in an Alms-Hou&s;e, by making them&s;elves a Prey to a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Ob&s;tinacy, and being the continual Bub|bles of the Vultures and Harpies of the Law.</P>
<P>The De&s;olation of their Families, the Confine|ment of their Wives, the di&s;owning and ba&s;tardi|zing of their own Children, with an inexhau&s;table Fund of Law-Suits entailed one upon another, are the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of their Frenzy; and the Countenance they find as long as they have Money wherewith to feed the hungry Lawyers, is what contributes to their Infatuation, and com|pleats their Ruin, to all Intents and Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>One may &s;ee them always in a Fury, with their Eyes &s;welled out of their Heads, and their Faces in a Flame, running from Attorney to Attorney, and from Council to Council, hunting for, and hiring, at a va&s;t Expence, fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, who cover all them with Ignominy, &s;topping their Ears again&s;t all the good Coun&s;el that is given them, and &s;hutting their Eyes again&s;t all the Examples of tho&s;e who have recovered their Sen&s;es. But of all the&s;e mad Wretches, none &s;ure was ever more di&s;tracted, than he over who&s;e Door they pa&s;ted up the following Ver&s;es.</P>

<P>On the other Side of the <HI>Pactolus</HI> are the <HI>Ima|ginary Cuckolds,</HI> who believe them&s;elves to be what they are not, and the <HI>Incredulous Cuckolds,</HI> who are not to be covinced that they are what they really are: The&s;e are two Sorts of Citizens, of very different Tempers; the fir&s;t re&s;olving to be Inhabitants of this City in Spight of all that could be done to prevent them; and the others being to the la&s;t Degree a&s;toni&s;hed at their being made free thereof, without having any Title to it, as they are plea&s;ed to flatter them&s;elves. The Hou&s;es of the&s;e Two Sorts of Citizens, who&s;e Tempers are &s;o very different, are &s;eparated from each other, by a Rivulet called the <HI>Perver&s;e,</HI> who&s;e Waters are &s;o muddy and &s;o thick, that the Eye cannot di&s;cover what lies at the Bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="77">
The <HI>Incredulous</HI> are only &s;o, becau&s;e they re|po&s;e too intire, and too implicit a Confidence in whatever their artful Wives endeavour to make them believe; they live contented, and at Quiet, but not like tho&s;e <HI>contented Ones</HI> in that Quarter called the <HI>Land of Plenty,</HI> who both know of, give Con&s;ent to, and pocket up their <HI>Horns,</HI> in order to reap their own Benefit from it, but by the Means of an indolent Ignorance, that keeps them from all Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Day la&s;ts, their whole Employment is to enjoy a &s;weet and peaceable Repo&s;e in the Fore&s;t of <HI>Confidence,</HI> a Place that is impene|trable by the Rays of the Sun, and not within the reach of the Noi&s;e of the City. The one might in vain beat all their Drums, and &s;ound all their Trumpets, yet would it never in the lea&s;t di&s;turb their Ears; and the other might &s;hine out with the greate&s;t Lu&s;tre, and diffu&s;e all his bright|e&s;t Rays around the Globe to as little Purpo&s;e, &s;ince it would not have the lea&s;t Effect upon their Eyes. Happy they in their peaceful Indolence! But more happy &s;till the artful Gip&s;ies, who have brought them to &s;uch a Pa&s;s!</P>
<P>There is nothing to be &s;een in this Quarter, but mutual Plea&s;ure and Endearments between the Hu&s;bands and Wives; the one, with an entire Con|fidence, think they can neither find Words obliging
<PB N="29" REF="78">
enough, or Care&s;&s;es tender enough to thank their Dears for a Fidelity, which they are far from keeping; and the &s;ubtle Baggages, the more they deceive them, the more they redouble their Wheedling, their Care&s;&s;es, and all Manner of fond and en&s;naring Endearments.</P>
<P>On the contrary, that Quarter which is inha|bited by the <HI>Imaginary Cuckolds,</HI> differs widely from this in every Particular; the People there are moro&s;e, quarrelfome, and un&s;ociable; one may ob&s;erve them always upon their Guard a|gain&s;t every Body, and both Sexes are equally &s;ubject to this Virtigo. Nothing there is to be heard, but Quarrels and Reproaches; the one are perpetually troubled with the <HI>Spleen,</HI> and the o|thers with the <HI>Vapours;</HI> their very Children fall Sacrifices to this reciprocal Caprice; even the mo&s;t legitimate are looked upon as Ba&s;tard Grafts; every Thing there is mi&s;con&s;trued, and they judge of nothing without Prejudice.

As <HI>Hornborough,</HI> although it is of a va&s;t Ex|tent, is far from being large enough to contain that prodigious Number of Inhabitants, who have actually an inconte&s;table Right to a Freedom there, the Country round about &s;warms with the meaner Sort, who leave the City for Courtiers, Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury and Cu&s;toms, Gen|tlemen of E&s;tates, great Merchants, &s;ub&s;tantial Trade&s;men, and &s;ome Officers of the Army; but above all for an infinite Number of <HI>Gown-Men,</HI> who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion marks them out for a <HI>Head-Piece</HI> of <HI>Horn-Work,</HI> which they very &s;eldom fail to wear.</P>
<P>Having thus given an Account of the whole Body of the I&s;land, there remains now only two little Di&s;tricts to be de&s;cribed, which are two Pe|nin&s;ula's that run out into the Sea; the one, which is on a Neck of Land towards the <HI>North,</HI> is the Promontory of <HI>Divorce,</HI> and the other, which is on another towards the <HI>South,</HI> is the Pro|montory of <HI>Widowhood.</HI></P>
<P>The Penin&s;ula of <HI>Divorce,</HI> is only &s;eparated from the I&s;le of <HI>Marriage,</HI> by a very narrow <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> through which it is pretty difficult to pa&s;s. It is called the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Corinth;</HI> and from thence came the Proverb, that every Body is not allowed to go to <HI>Corinth;</HI> that is to &s;ay, that
<PB N="32" REF="81">
every Body is not allowed a Pa&s;&s;age into the <HI>Pe|nin&s;ula</HI> of <HI>Divorce.</HI></P>
<P>The Extravagance of an old Chancellour of a Dioce&s;s, who was de&s;irous of rendering this Pa&s;&s;age more ea&s;y, induced him formerly to con&s;titute an imprudent, filthy, and brutal Giant, called my Lord <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> Superintendant of this <HI>I&s;thmus.</HI> This was a <HI>Curious</HI> and <HI>Shamele&s;s Wretch,</HI> who in order to remove the Difficulties of this Pa&s;&s;age, rendered <HI>Impotent,</HI> (by obliging them to be per|form'd in Publick,) the <HI>Conjugal Efforts</HI> of tho&s;e Hu&s;bands, who would have hindered their Wives from removing into this <HI>Penin&s;ula.</HI> The Mode&s;ty of the Moderns, wou'd no longer &s;uffer this filthy Lord to expo&s;e the Combatants to this Shame and Infamy, wherefore they have ca&s;hier'd this ridi|culous Superintendant; but in Return, the artful <HI>Amathontins</HI> have brought into Play another En|chantre&s;s, who has been introduced under the Name of <HI>Separation,</HI> and they have &s;upported her &s;o well, that &s;he makes few Attempts without Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>It is &s;he who now peoples the <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> of <HI>Divorce,</HI> becau&s;e the River <HI>Repudiate,</HI> whereby they formerly arrived thither, is no longer navi|gable; thus by removing a &s;mall Evil which pro|duced a great Good, they have introduced a
<PB N="33" REF="82">
&s;mall Good, which does not prevent a great Evil.</P>
<P>This little Country has neither Towns nor Vil|lages; all the Hou&s;es are &s;eparated from each other like Hermitages; and to take a View of it from the neighbouring Eminencies, one wou'd fancy it actually the Abode of &s;ome Anchorets. But the Solitude and Melancholy of the&s;e De&s;arts, is mightily alleviated, by the frequent Intercour&s;e of the <HI>Amathontins,</HI> who take abundance of De|light therein, and find the Means to admini&s;ter agreeable Con&s;olation to the &s;olitary Inhabitants. Above all, this is the Place where the Gentlemen of the long Robe gain the mo&s;t Triumphs; for as the Fair Sex cannot get over the Difficulties that ob&s;truct this Pa&s;&s;age, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who wear that Robe, their fir&s;t Care is always to provide them&s;elves of a Protector, who may remove all Ob&s;tacles.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Country are not be|loved by tho&s;e in the I&s;le of <HI>Marriage;</HI> but when the latter take upon them to blame their Conduct, they have an An&s;wer ready, which is as follows.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Full happily, tho' &s;omething late,</HI></L>
<L><HI>We're freed from the cur&s;ed Marriage State,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="34" REF="83">
<HI>That Bane and Torment of our Lives;</HI></L>
<L><HI>You who've of late put on tho&s;e Chains,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And blame our Conduct, count your Gains,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When your</HI> new Dears <HI>are grown</HI> meer Wives.</L>
<L><HI>A little Patience, we be&s;eech,</HI></L>
<L><HI>E're you begin to us to preach,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And you e're long will &s;urely find,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That even they who fare the be&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And envy'd are by all the re&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Are far from Ble&s;t in their own Mind.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Although the&s;e <HI>Divorces</HI> are mo&s;t commonly demanded by the Women, the Men &s;ometimes don't fail to take Advantage thereof, and &s;everal Hu&s;bands have even found the Means to provoke their Wives artfully to &s;ue for them, and then pretending to oppo&s;e it, they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be ca&s;t, like <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Mi&s;tre&s;s, who was overcome (as he &s;ays) by her own Treachery. This made one of tho&s;e, who had got rid of his Matrimonial Burthen by this Arti&s;ice, and had obtained a Place in this Solitude, have the Picture of a Ship in a Storm drawn in <HI>Fre&s;co</HI> in his Cell, and the Pilot calling out to the Sailors to fling over board all the heavie&s;t Luggage, in Obedience to which Or|der, one of them takes up his Wife, and throws her into the Sea, with the following Lines at the Bottom of the Picture:</P>
<Q><PB N="35" REF="84">
<L><HI>Whil&s;t th' angry Waves run Mountains high,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And o'er the &s;hatter'd Ve&s;&s;el break,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Throw over board, the Sailors cry,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Your</HI> heavie&s;t <HI>Goods, for all's at Stake.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Pleas'd with this Order to comply,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I to the Floods commit my Wife,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For &s;ure I am that never I,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Had</HI> heavier <HI>Goods in all my Life.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The other <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> is that of <HI>Widowhood,</HI> which is upon a Promontory that lies towards the <HI>South,</HI> and is only &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the I&s;land, by a very narrow Neck of Land, which is wholly taken up by a magnificent <HI>Mau&s;oleum,</HI> built after the Model of that of Queen <HI>Artemi&s;a;</HI> in&s;omuch that there is no pa&s;&s;ing for any one from the I&s;le of <HI>Marriage,</HI> to the Di&s;trict of <HI>Widow|hood,</HI> but through this Tomb, by the Means of a &s;ubterraneous Vault, that is contrived under it.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants always make their Entrance there in Mourning, and they live there in Joy and Plea&s;ure; the Air of this Country, which every one there breaths with Freedom, being the mo&s;t con&s;olatory in the World. Neverthele&s;s, all the Inhabitants are not able to reli&s;h it with Plea&s;ure, and Satisfaction; for there comes a Wind, from the Coa&s;t of a certain little Province of the I&s;land, called <HI>Binubia,</HI> who&s;e malignant Atoms
<PB N="36" REF="85">
cau&s;e <HI>new Itchings,</HI> which create &s;uch Unea&s;ine&s;s, as tho&s;e that are troubled therewith, believe they can have no Cure for, without going to <HI>Binubia,</HI> and breathing the Air of that Place.</P>
<P>One cannot re-enter the I&s;land of <HI>Marriage,</HI> but by this Coa&s;t, which makes a little &s;eparate Province, and has even &s;ome particular Laws, which are not ob&s;erved in the other Provinces.</P>
<P>In order to &s;et &s;ail for this little Country of <HI>Binubia,</HI> the Inhabitants of the Penin&s;ula of <HI>Wi|dowhood,</HI> mu&s;t embark at a certain little Port, which has taken its Name from the celebrated <HI>Ephe&s;ian</HI> Matron, becau&s;e it was there &s;he took &s;hipping with her Soldier, in order to &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Binubia.</HI> Neverthele&s;s &s;everal Per&s;ons have given it the Name of <HI>Evil Coun&s;el,</HI> although the Marble, that is at the Foot of an old Statue which is placed there, gives very <HI>good Coun&s;el</HI> in the fol|lowing Ver&s;es, which are to be &s;een thereon.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Why will you part with that dear Liberty,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which you've &s;o &s;igh'd for, and &s;o dearly bought?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Why run again into that Slavery,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whence fortunately you by Death was brought?</HI></L>
<L><HI>From Shipwrack once e&s;cap'd the prudent Man,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When he's arriv'd &s;afe at his wi&s;h'd for Port,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tempts he the Dangers of the Sea again,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To make him&s;elf of Winds and Waves the Sport?</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB N="37" REF="86">
And on the other Side of the Marble, one may read the&s;e other Ver&s;es.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Whoe'er, once freed from Marriage Chain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hamper them&s;elves therein again,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Incorrigible write them down,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Title they can't well di&s;own;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And I, with all my Soul, con&s;ent,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To doom them to the Puni&s;hment,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tho&s;e harden'd</HI> Culprits <HI>mu&s;t expect,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whom Mercy &s;hewn will not affect.</HI></L></Q>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to imagine with what violent Fits of Laughter, what cutting Raillery, the In|habitants of <HI>Widowhood</HI> banter tho&s;e who &s;et out for <HI>Binubia;</HI> they hire an infinite Number of Hawkers, who are perpetually hollowing in their Ears, <HI>A Warning to all old Widows, who marry &s;econd Hu&s;bands. The lamentable Hi&s;tory and Downfall of the old Widower, who married his Cook-maid; come a Halfpenny a Piece, a Halfpenny a Piece,</HI> and a Thou&s;and other &s;uch biting Je&s;ts, in Deri&s;ion to tho&s;e, who have not the Re&s;olution to keep them&s;elves in that happy State, which perhaps they have ardently wi&s;h'd for a hundred Times, before the happy Minute of their Deli|verance came.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="87">
But the People of <HI>Binubia,</HI> who have often been them&s;elves the fir&s;t, to rally tho&s;e whom they have afterwards follow'd, give, once for all, the following An&s;wer to tho&s;e who &s;tay behind.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Patience, too &s;oon your Bli&s;s you boa&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Perhaps you count without your Ho&s;t;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Already once the Fool you've play'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And may again, you're not yet dead.</HI></L></Q>
<P>And perhaps they are not very much in the Wrong, when they an&s;wer them in this Man|ner; for it frequently happens that we fall into that very &s;ame Error, for which we have been the fir&s;t to reprehend others; and mo&s;t Part of the Inhabitants of <HI>Binubia,</HI> did not engage in &s;econd Marriages, till after they had often endea|voured to di&s;&s;uade others from it.</P>
<P><HI>Binubia,</HI> is a little City, who&s;e Buildings are for the mo&s;t Part old, and almo&s;t ready to fall; only the Walls are new white-wa&s;h'd, new plai|&s;ter'd up, and new painted according to Art, to hide all Defects. Every Thing there has a me|lancholy and mournful A&s;pect: and as almo&s;t every Match there has been made by the Influ|ence of Self-Intere&s;t, all there are intent upon managing their Affairs to their own private Ad|vantage,
<PB N="39" REF="88">
at the Expence of their Partner, whom they flatter them&s;elves with the Hopes of &s;ur|viving. Accordingly the very be&s;t Employment of any in this Country, is to follow the Law, in order to take Advantage of the innumerable Law-Suits which are daily cau&s;ed by &s;econd Mar|riages.</P>
<P>Nothing is to be heard there, but the Com|plaints, and mournful Lamentations, of Children by a fir&s;t Marriage, who have been robb'd, and cheated of their Right, to inrich tho&s;e by a &s;e|cond; with endle&s;s Enquiries into Titles to E&s;tates, to which the Lawyers at la&s;t become the Principal Heirs; and Di&s;putes about Guardians Accounts, and fal&s;e Inventories: In &s;hort, every Thing there is in Trouble and Confu&s;ion, and the Pettyfoggers have not in the World &s;uch another fruitful Nur&s;ery of Law-Suits.</P>
<P>Having now given you an Account of all the different People that inhabit the I&s;land of <HI>Mar|riage;</HI> viz. the <HI>Di&s;creet,</HI> the <HI>Ill-match'd,</HI> the <HI>Ill-at-Ea&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Jealous,</HI> the <HI>Cuckolds,</HI> the <HI>Binu|bians,</HI> the <HI>Divorced,</HI> and the Inhabitants of <HI>Wi|dowhood;</HI> nothing remains but to give likewi&s;e &s;ome De&s;cription of their Enemies, the <HI>Ama|thontins,</HI> and the perpetual Wars they have with them.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="89">
I have already ob&s;erved that <HI>Amathontis,</HI> or the I&s;land of <HI>Lovers,</HI> is not far di&s;tant from the I&s;le of <HI>Marriage;</HI> and indeed it is &s;o near, that the <HI>Amathontins</HI> are every Moment invading them in prodigious Numbers, and never fail making terrible Havock among&s;t them; in&s;omuch that they are very &s;eldom driven out again, when they have once got Footing there. One Province or other is always warmly engaged with them, e&s;pecially <HI>Cuckold&s;hire,</HI> which is over-run with their Multitudes, and the others are not free from them.</P>
<P>Their Manner of waging War is very plea&s;ant, for it is not in Incur&s;ions, that make a great Noi&s;e and Bu&s;tle in the World, that they place their chief Hope, and Dependence; no, they do their Bu&s;ine&s;s much better, by introducing them|&s;elves without Clamour, by getting Footing pri|vately, and by gaining over to their Intere&s;t all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons in the Country: But they have no &s;ooner made a Lodgment any where, but they know how to maintain them|&s;elves therein, and the fewer they march in Com|pany, the more formidable they are.</P>
<P>It is not then with open Force, that they at|tack the Enemy whom they de&s;ign to <HI>overthrow;</HI> one hears neither Trumpet &s;ound, nor Drum beat, when they march either to <HI>&s;torm</HI> a <HI>Fort,</HI> or to

<P>As for their Weapons, <HI>Volleys of Sighs</HI> are their only <HI>Small-Arms; Langui&s;hing</HI> and <HI>dying Eyes,</HI> their only <HI>Swords;</HI> and the <HI>&s;ofte&s;t</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t tender Expre&s;&s;ions,</HI> their <HI>mo&s;t dangerous Artillery:</HI> They have indeed a Kind of <HI>Short Stilletto</HI> which they <HI>always</HI> carry <HI>about them conceal'd,</HI> and with which they &s;ometimes give <HI>dangerous Stabs;</HI> but this is never but when they are <HI>very clo&s;e,</HI> and <HI>very warmly engaged,</HI> and have the <HI>Enemy down and at a Di&s;advantage,</HI> for which Rea&s;on &s;ome Per|&s;ons will &s;carcely allow it to be a <HI>fair Weapon;</HI> but, be that as it will, it is well known, that <HI>few</HI> of the <HI>Enemy</HI> are <HI>afraid</HI> of its <HI>mo&s;t home Thru&s;ts.</HI> Their <HI>greate&s;t Valour</HI> then con&s;i&s;ts only in their <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Complai&s;ance</HI> to their Enemies; their <HI>Glory</HI> is wholly confin'd to <HI>loading</HI> them with their <HI>own Spoils;</HI> and their mo&s;t <HI>compleat Victory</HI> is in <HI>expiring</HI> between the <HI>Arms</HI> of the <HI>conquer'd Enemy;</HI> in &s;hort, the <HI>more &s;ecret</HI> their <HI>Triumphs</HI> are, the <HI>greater. Plea&s;ure</HI> they <HI>take</HI> in them.</P>
<P>By this Conduct, and provided the <HI>Sinews of War</HI> are <HI>not wanting,</HI> there is nothing which an
<PB N="42" REF="91">
<HI>Amathontin</HI> cannot effect: <HI>No Fortifications</HI> are <HI>Proof</HI> again&s;t their <HI>Cannon,</HI> nor is there any <HI>Fort</HI> which will not <HI>&s;urrender,</HI> if they <HI>per&s;evere</HI> in their <HI>Attacks.</HI> This made them once put the following In&s;cription upon a <HI>Quiver,</HI> which they dedicated to the <HI>God of Love.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>In th' I&s;land which from</HI> Marriage <HI>takes its Name,</HI></L>
<L><HI>E&s;pecially among&s;t the</HI> Jealous <HI>Sands,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The watchfull'&s;t, haughtie&s;t, and de&s;creete&s;t Dame,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With Difficuly can e&s;cape our Hands:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet do we never open War declare,</HI></L>
<L><HI>We are a kind of &s;ubtle Privateers;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And when we find a tender hearted Fair,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With all her num'rous Train of Hopes and Fears;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Let</HI> Argus <HI>all his Hundred Eyes employ,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Still will we be the Ma&s;ters of the Field,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Spight of him we'll &s;eize the killing Joy,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And force the coye&s;t, &s;tubborn'&s;t She to yield.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Neither do they often fail of being as good as their Words. The&s;e <HI>Amathontins,</HI> are an agree|able, free, good-humoured, generous, and di&s;in|tere&s;ted People, in&s;omuch that in&s;tead of ravag|ing, and ama&s;&s;ing Spoils in the Country of <HI>Mar|riage,</HI> they &s;pend at &s;uch a Rate, that they very often enrich tho&s;e they have <HI>overthrown,</HI> and
<PB N="43" REF="92">
tho&s;e who have connived at their getting any Footing in the Country.</P>
<P>But whoever would attempt to de&s;cribe all the Wiles, and all the Stratagems, whereof this artful Nation makes u&s;e of, in order to introduce them|&s;elves, make a Lodgment, and gain a compleat Victory, would be obliged to write Millions of Volumes. Not but that there are among them an infinite Number of <HI>Incon&s;tants, Indi&s;creet Ones,</HI> and <HI>Impo&s;tors;</HI> one may hear Complaints made of them every Day. But, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Complaints, there would be no living with|out them, and half their Enemies would be in a very &s;ad Condition, if they &s;hould cea&s;e to make War upon them.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to conceive into what a good Humour the Reading of this agreeable Piece put the whole Company, by its humerous De&s;crip|tion of the I&s;le of <HI>Marriage.</HI> All owned it to be exqui&s;itely imagined, and to be carried on with the nice&s;t Judgment; at la&s;t it brought into our Minds the celebrated <HI>Map</HI> of <HI>Tender</HI> in the Ro|mance of <HI>Clelia,</HI> which formerly was highly ex|toll'd, but every one agreed that this had &s;eve|ral Beauties, and a Delicacy, and Turn, which the other was far from coming up to.</P>
<P>Every one then called to Remembrance tho&s;e Places which had made the mo&s;t lively Impre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="44" REF="93">
upon their Imagination; but of all the Parts of the I&s;land, they always returned again to <HI>Hornborough,</HI> through a certain natural Inclina|tion, which &s;eems to draw all the World thither; either to make Part of its Inhabitants, or to laugh at them, and very often for both. For the Citizens of this va&s;t City have this merry Facul|ty belonging to them, that they generally ridicule one another; &s;ome to divert Peoples Thoughts from being fixed upon them, and others to comfort them&s;elves for their own Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, <HI>Melinda,</HI> one of the three Ladies who were with us, and who has a delicate and ju&s;t Way of thinking and expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, turned about to me, and a&s;ked me, If I could give any Rea&s;on, why People were fond of having it thought, that the <HI>Horned Society</HI> are the Chief, and mo&s;t numerous Part of the Inhabitanes of this va&s;t Country.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me a Que&s;tion, Madam, &s;aid I, to which it is not very difficult to find an An&s;wer; for as &s;oon as you reflect, that this formidable Society con&s;i&s;ts for the mo&s;t Part of Men who are <HI>haughty, un&s;ociable, moro&s;e, &s;nappi&s;h, ill-natured, uncomplai&s;ant, unea&s;y</HI> in their Circum&s;tances, and perpetually employed about every Thing that is the <HI>mo&s;t unlikely</HI> to render a Man <HI>gallant</HI> and
<PB N="45" REF="94">
<HI>agreeable,</HI> you will find more Rea&s;ons than one, for what you de&s;ire to know.</P>
<P>The&s;e few Words opened us a large Field of Scandal, and gave us full Scope to take a general Review of &s;ome Hundreds of our Acquaintance, which we accordingly did afterwards, Time not then permitting by Rea&s;on Dinner was ready: Wherefore we adjourned our Satire 'till After|noon, at the joint Invitation of <HI>Ceres, Bacchus,</HI> and our own Appetites, which were by this Time pretty &s;harp &s;et. What pa&s;&s;ed afterwards may po&s;&s;ibly prove the Entertainment of another Day, if this meets with a favourable Acceptance from the Town.</P>

<P>Now, Sir, as you have been a Hou&s;e-Keeper, and married the&s;e &s;everal Years, pray tell me, If in any one Article, I have charged too much?

and though it be nece&s;&s;ary, yet how rea|&s;onable it is, I &s;ubmit to you.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things con&s;idered (and he that marries without previous Con&s;ideration acts very indi&s;|creetly) I do not &s;ee how I can marry a Woman with the Fortune you propo&s;e, or that I &s;hould better my &s;elf at all by it, and in Prudence, Peo|ple &s;hould do &s;o, or let it alone; (not that I pro|po&s;e or think to have more) I mu&s;t therefore live &s;ingle, tho' with &s;ome Regret that I cannot do otherwi&s;e, and increa&s;e my own Fortune, which happens to be &s;ufficient for my own Maintenance till, (if I may &s;o call it) I can afford Matrimony.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR E&s;timate has been read over and con&s;idered in our Family, and now lies upon the Table to be peru&s;ed by the Neighbours.</P>
<P>Several Objections have been made to it, I &s;hall take Notice of &s;ome of them. It is ob&s;er|ved, That you do not deal with that Candour and Ingenuity in &s;tating the Account that you ought to do; for in the Way you compute, you make
<PB N="64" REF="109">
no Allowance for the Reputation and Advantage which you will in many Re&s;pects gain, and which will accrue to your &s;elf by a Hou&s;e kept in the Manner you mention; the Credit of which, in a great Mea&s;ure, centers in you, while the Care of it lies wholly upon your Wife. So that in 128 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen Articles, from the Butcher's Bill, down to Brick-Du&s;t, Rotten-Stone, Whiteing, and other little Ingredients, you will be found not only to be the greate&s;t Cau&s;e of the Expence, but will have the principal Share in the Plea&s;ure, and in the E&s;teem obtained by it; tho' it is true, <HI>Fullers-Rents</HI> and <HI>Sheer-Lane</HI> lo&s;e 1 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> a Day by your Dinners. The &s;ame Error runs through &s;ome other Articles; for my Relation will not, I believe, ea&s;ily comprehend why &s;he &s;hould be &s;olely loaded with the Charge of ex|pending 45 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> upon Children, which you &s;eem very well di&s;po&s;ed to get. Be&s;ides, let me tell you, <HI>Jack,</HI> you ought to bring into the Account the Saving which will ari&s;e from the re|gular Proceeding in that Affair, which, upon the Change of your Condition, you mu&s;t make to come wonderfully cheap to you; a Grandee of <HI>Spain</HI> reproached the Lady whom he had married with a &s;mall Fortune, that he believed that every Plea&s;ure he had had with her, had co&s;t him a <HI>Dobloon</HI> a Time; &s;he replied, that was none of
<PB N="65" REF="110">
her Fault, for his Excellency might have reduced it to &s;ix <HI>Denieres</HI> a Time if he had plea&s;ed, in the two Years they had lain together. I doubt you &s;ink an Article of your Expence here; you know, <HI>Jack,</HI> your beloved <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays, there are Things, <HI>quibus doleat Natura negatis,</HI> and does not lovele&s;s, joyle&s;s, unindeared, ca&s;ual Fruition co&s;t you Money? You tell us of the Doctor and the Apothecary when you are married; 'tis well for you, if you &s;teer clear of the Surgeon before you enter into that State. Nothing but urgent Nece&s;&s;ity can draw Money from you; he that deals in cheap Pictures, and cheap Women, is a Lo&s;er at la&s;t.</P>
<P>In your concluding Remark, you &s;eem unju&s;tly to dimini&s;h my Kin&s;woman's Fortune; for is not the 300 <HI>l.</HI> Furniture of your Hou&s;e and Table-Linen, with the 50 <HI>l.</HI> for Plate, your own as much as if it were in Ca&s;h? And does not every Circum&s;tance in a married Life recommend you to the World, equal to the Money it co&s;ts you, if laid out prudently? You have a Settlement by it, that makes you a better Subject, a more u&s;eful Friend, and a more virtuous Man.</P>
<P>How many are they who by Degrees hardening them&s;elves again&s;t the Sex e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Laws of Nature, and of the Land, at la&s;t fall into a horrible and odious Sin of Non-Conformity, never
<PB N="66" REF="111">
tolerated in any Chri&s;tian Country? This &s;ome|times draws an Expence after it in a Compo&s;ition far exceeding the 43 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> the proper and &s;ole Charge of the Plea&s;ures of Matrimony by your own Calculation, which you cannot per|&s;uade your &s;elf to undergo, as not thinking them yearly worth that Sum.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider <HI>Jack,</HI> who are your truly idle Fellows in Town and Country, that &s;aunter away their Time at Coffee-Hou&s;es and at Gaming-Tables: They are all or mo&s;t of them of your Family, Mr <HI>Single.</HI> The young Fellows who are always &s;tudying how to &s;pend Time, to pa&s;s away Time, to wear away Time, to kill Time, they are all of your Family: the Rea&s;on is plain, they have nothing in the World for which it is worth while to improve Time. Be&s;ides, Idlene&s;s teacheth all Kind of Evil, and while you by your par&s;imo|nious Celibacy deny your &s;elf the proper Reme|dy, you cheri&s;h the Di&s;ea&s;e, and at the &s;ame Time you endeavour to check the River in its natural Channel, you make it overflow the bor|dering Meadows.</P>
<P>What Topicks are u&s;ed to incite a Man to de|fend the Liberty of his Country? 'Tis for the Sake of his Family and Po&s;terity, for the Sake of his Wife and Children; the Argument will have little Force, if urged for the Sake of <HI>Jack Single,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="112">
at his Chambers two Pair of Stairs high in <HI>Grey's-Inn.</HI></P>
<P>What Argument did the <HI>Ga&s;con</HI> u&s;e to re&s;train a Man from a ra&s;h (as he thought it,) Action? Fighting with him; won't you con&s;ider, crys the <HI>Ga&s;con,</HI> (when their Swords were drawn,) your Wife? No, &s;ays the Man. Won't you con&s;ider, crys he, your Wife and Children? No, No, &s;ays the other, then I will, reply'd the <HI>Ga&s;con,</HI> and gravely put up his Sword.</P>

<P>AS I am the real Author of the <HI>Batchelor's E&s;timate,</HI> which has for &s;ome Time af|forded Diver&s;ion to, and undergone the Critici&s;ms of the Town; I think in Ju&s;tice to it, I &s;hould vindicate it from the A&s;per&s;ions thrown on it and the Author, e&s;pecially from tho&s;e in Print, that I think worth con&s;idering. As to two of them the LADY's ANSWER, and the WO|MAN's ADVOCATE, I &s;hall take no farther No|tice of them, than that they have the Names of An&s;wers, only to make the Copies of the <HI>E&s;ti|mate,</HI> which they annexed to them, and pirated from the true Proprietor, to &s;ell the better. As to the fir&s;t, the Town at its fir&s;t coming out was &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied 'twas a <HI>Grub-&s;treet;</HI> as to the &s;econd, I think it beneath a Gentleman to an&s;wer
<PB N="74" REF="116">
it, becau&s;e no Gentleman could have wrote it, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;o much Scurrility: It's &s;ufficient Sa|tisfaction to me to ob&s;erve, that the Readers of it, from its being &s;o prepo&s;terous and &s;currilous, immediately cry out of the Author, <HI>This Fellow is a Fool.</HI> As to the Married Man's An&s;wer, be|cau&s;e 'tis wrote like a Gentleman, and with no &s;uch &s;ordid View as the others were, I chu&s;e for tho&s;e Rea&s;ons to an&s;wer it, and &s;hall therefore in &s;o doing addre&s;s my&s;elf to the Author thereof.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing, Sir, you begin with by way of An&s;wer, is, That I make no Allowance for the Reputation and Advantage, which you &s;ay I &s;hall in many Re&s;pects gain by Hou&s;e-keeping. Could you have mentioned any one of tho&s;e many Re|&s;pects, I don't doubt but that you would; but &s;uch a general Charge, without any Rea&s;on or Foundation mention'd to &s;upport it, &s;eems to me to argue, as if you could not maintain your Alle|gation; and indeed I can't conceive how you can. Does paying Pari&s;h-Taxes clear our Intellects, or does Matrimony refine our Judgements? If not, how comes it about, and on what Foundation can the <HI>married Man</HI> and Hou&s;e-keeper have a greater Reputation than the <HI>Batchelor?</HI> I mu&s;t own I don't know: But now I think on't indeed, in one re&s;pect he may; that is, by marrying an agreeable Woman he &s;tands a very fair Chance of having a
<PB N="75" REF="117">
Reputation, now very much in vogue, in that State; which, I thank my Stars, I, as a <HI>Batchelor,</HI> am only capacitated to give, but not to receive. Was I to employ a Per&s;on to manage my Affairs, I &s;hould chu&s;e to employ the <HI>Batchelor,</HI> in regard the <HI>married Man</HI> has &s;o much to do to mind his Family-Affairs, he'll have but little Time to mind tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>As to the Deductions you would have made on the Account of ca&s;ual Fruition, and the con&s;equen|tial Articles of it; before you make &s;uch a De|duction, you &s;hould fir&s;t lay it down as nece&s;&s;ary, that young Fellows mu&s;t <HI>Whore</HI> or <HI>Marry,</HI> other|wi&s;e 'tis ungenerous to tax me, as I have not com|mitted the one, that I mu&s;t the other. If you make it out, that a Batchelor mu&s;t go a <HI>whoring,</HI> you have found out &s;omething new, and as the fir&s;t Di&s;coveries of any Thing <HI>u&s;eful</HI> ought to have Thanks, you have mine. If there's no &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity, for ought you know I may be one of tho&s;e <HI>Batchelors,</HI> that walking between two Pre|cipices <HI>(Whoredom</HI> and <HI>Matrimony)</HI> may have &s;o cautiou&s;ly directed my Steps, as to avoid both. But as 'tis not for my <HI>Credit</HI> with the Fair Sex to pretend not to have been gratified by any of them, I own I have had &s;ome Amours, but not with &s;uch as were &s;ordidly pro&s;tituting their Charms for Gain; but with tho&s;e only, who gratified
<PB N="76" REF="118">
me for no other Pro&s;pect, than an equal Return of Love, con&s;equently no Deduction ought to be made on the Account of the Expence of it. But &s;uppo&s;ing that my Ta&s;te has been &s;o very low, as to take up with tho&s;e, that lett their Charms to hire, and that I have been at &s;ome Expence in that Re&s;pect; yet as Women are now-a-days very cheap (pardon me, I mean tho&s;e of the Town) and their Price runs at a low Ebb; 30 <HI>l.</HI> a Year will drive a pretty good Trade with that Sort of Ware; and I am told you may agree by the Great, and for Five Guineas a Year in&s;ure your|&s;elf again&s;t any ill Con&s;equences that may happen. And if the Expence of ca&s;ual Fruition is no more (as prudent Dealers therein a&s;&s;ure me it is not) I am &s;ure the Undervaluations and Omi&s;&s;ions in my E&s;timate amount to above twice tho&s;e Sums.</P>
<P>You alledge (and for Argument-&s;ake &s;uppo&s;e it true) that in the Articles of Hou&s;e-keeping I &s;hall have the principal Plea&s;ure, yet I mu&s;t be at &s;ix Parts in &s;even of the Expence. Pray how &s;tands it then? Is that Encouragement to commence Hu&s;band?</P>
<P>'Tis not my Wife, but I, &s;hall bear the Load of the Expence of Children, for you &s;ee her For|tune can &s;carcely an&s;wer any Expence at all; but as &s;he partakes of an equal, if not, as mo&s;t allow, a greater Plea&s;ure in the begetting them, I don't

&s;ee why &s;he &s;hould not proportionably contribute to their Maintenance.</P>
<P>By the Story of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Grandee, you would in&s;inuate (and con&s;i&s;tent enough with your Admi&s;&s;ion of my being well di&s;pos'd to get Chil|dren) that let it co&s;t me what it will, I may by a frequent Repetition of the Plea&s;ures of Matri|mony, (and I dare &s;ay, not di&s;agreeable to my Wife) reduce the Expence of each Plea&s;ure to a very minute Sum, unle&s;s it was my own Fault, which admits a Readine&s;s of one Side. But on a &s;econd Calculation of the Expences of the E&s;ti|mate, I find I &s;hall pay for tho&s;e Plea&s;ures at the Rate of 12 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> for each Night's Lodging; a meer Trifle, you'll &s;ay: But however, whether after Honey-Moon is over, (which, by the Way, they tell me is the &s;horte&s;t in the Year) tho&s;e Plea&s;ures will be &s;o frequent, as to reduce the Expence of them to a very minute Sum; or on the other Side, whether &s;everal 12 <HI>s.</HI> 8 Pences will not be expended towards each Plea&s;ure, is the hazardous Experiment I &s;till decline to make; but leave it to tho&s;e who have &s;hot the <HI>Gulf,</HI> and now know the Danger, to reflect how prudent they were, when they undertook &s;o hardy an Enterprize: where, let the dear Partner be &s;ullen and ill temper'd, or gay and good-natur'd; let her by Chance or otherwi&s;e be ugly or agreeable;
<PB N="78" REF="120">
let her be ob&s;treperous and unruly, and, <HI>Xantippe</HI> like, &s;cold me out of Hou&s;e and Home, or be meek and conde&s;cending; let her be expen&s;ive (and what &s;ome good Wives have indu&s;triou&s;|ly done) run me into Goal, or the frugal and careful; let her be healthy or ailing; let her be a <HI>Me&s;&s;alina,</HI> or a <HI>Lucrece;</HI> let her have all the ill, and none of the good Qualities; yet this <HI>dear Creature</HI> I am de&s;tin'd to love and cheri&s;h for Life, &s;he mu&s;t be Partaker of my Bed and Board. From this Bargain, tho' ne'er &s;o ill concerted, there's no Appeal lies, or any Redre&s;s to be had. Who then that lives already comfortably and happy, would, (not knowing when he was well) be Fool enough to make an Experiment; where, if it happens according to his Wi&s;hes, he can but live &s;till comfortable and happy; and where, if it does not (as I believe mo&s;t People will allow it to be a rea&s;onable Chance to lay twenty to one again&s;t him) he'll have only this &s;ad Reflection; I was happy, but &s;trove to be otherwi&s;e, and am &s;o. Such an Experiment would be as prudent, as that made by a Per&s;on, who having a very va|luable Diamond, would needs try, whether it was &s;o hard as to bear the Strokes of a Hammer on an Anvil. He &s;atisfied his Curio&s;ity; what follow'd? The Diamond broke, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it cur&s;t his Stars, for having been &s;uch a Fool.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="121">
You &s;ay by Marriage I became a better Subject, a more u&s;eful Friend, and a more virtuous Man, neither of which can I allow. As to the fir&s;t then; There is no Law that commands or forbids us to marry; He that does not, tran&s;gre&s;&s;es no Law; and he that does, complies with none. How can one then be a better Member of a Community, or a better Subject than the other, when what is &s;aid to make a Difference between them, is in it&s;elf indifferent. But as every Body, thank Hea|ven, is left to his own Choice; and mine, I think, is the be&s;t, being con&s;i&s;tent with the Opi|nion of an in&s;pired Writer; I pronounce my&s;elf a better Subject, who can without Inju&s;tice to any, freely engage in the Service of my King and Country; and as <HI>Pomfret</HI> &s;ays, afford them <HI>my Tongue, my Pen, my Fortune and my Sword;</HI> than he, that is obliged to make u&s;e of all the&s;e, to mini&s;ter to the Nece&s;&s;ities of a Family, which he is ty'd to; and which, con&s;i&s;tent with the Laws of God and Man, 'tis his utmo&s;t Duty to provide for.</P>
<P>To be a more u&s;eful Friend, it is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible for a married Man; for he mu&s;t (and it is a great Sin if he omits it) breed up, main|tain and provide for his Family: if, during that Time, he &s;hould provide for a Relation, do a Friend a Kindne&s;s, or this, or that Act of Charity, it
<PB N="80" REF="122">
will be looked upon to be, and &s;o it is in Fact, &s;o far a Robbery of his own Family; &s;o that the Tyes of his Duty in that Re&s;pect are &s;o &s;trong, he can &s;carce do one Act of Benevolence to any other: &s;o true is the old Proverb, <HI>Charity begins at Home.</HI> And even when he has done all he can, his thankle&s;s Children (which, by the way, is no great Encouragement to beget them) think he made a very ill U&s;e of his Time, in not hav|ing rai&s;ed them greater Fortunes: Whereas the <HI>Batchelor</HI> having none but him&s;elf to provide for, and having the &s;ame Methods and Talents of becoming rich, with <HI>the married Man,</HI> without a Quarter of the Expence, &s;oon gains that End; while it is well, if the married Man, with his greate&s;t Indu&s;try, &s;upports his Family. <HI>The Bat|chelor</HI> gives his Niece, or Cou&s;in a Fortune, and places her in the World; binds a Nephew Ap|prentice, puts out a poor Child to School, relieves a poor iudu&s;trious Family &s;truggling with Poverty, lends or gives a Friend a Sum on an Emergency; ALL the&s;e he does, not as a Performance of any Duty incumbent on him, nor will it be e&s;teemed as &s;uch, but as meer Acts of Benevolence; he robs none, he does none Inju&s;tice, his Family at home want it not; he is valued and re&s;pected as a truly generous Soul, he &s;ees the good Things he does, rewarded in the Gratitude of the Re|ceivers
<PB N="81" REF="123">
of his Benevolence; and in the Increa&s;e of his Fortune, which, with his good Intentions, gives him Ability; whil&s;t the <HI>married Man,</HI> tho' perhaps he may have the Inclination, yet very &s;eldom has the Ability of being half &s;o u&s;eful a Friend as the Batchelor.</P>
<P>As to the married Man's being more virtuous than a Batchelor, I am &s;atisfied there are &s;o ma|ny Provocations to Pa&s;&s;ion in Family-Concerns, that the married Man lies under a frequenter Temptation to Sin in that re&s;pect: And be&s;ides, the nece&s;&s;ary Par&s;imony a Hu&s;band mu&s;t be Ma|&s;ter of, to &s;upport his Family, often betrays him into a &s;trange Narrowne&s;s of Temper and Avarice. And every Body knows, that there are Sins, and great ones too, incident only to a married State, which, it is well, if they are avoided: Tho&s;e of <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion,</HI> even were our Bo&s;om Friends our Wives Judges, I dare &s;ay, are not few.</P>
<P>As to the odious Sin of Nonconformity, I think it is ungenerous in the highe&s;t Degree to &s;ugge&s;t any Thing without due Grounds for it; but let it &s;tick on the Guilty: As for my Part, I a&s;&s;ure you, I love the Fair Sex &s;o well, I would wil|lingly oblige them in any Thing in the World, but <HI>marry</HI> them.</P>
<P>As to &s;auntering at Coffee-Hou&s;es, and Lo&s;s at Play, I would have you know I have Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="82" REF="124">
to employ me, &s;o as not to be idle; and even not to have Time &s;o much almo&s;t as to think of Matrimony, (for I think none but Idlers do think on it;) and as to Play, I am &s;o far aver&s;e to any Thing that is attended with Hazard and Un|certainty, that I decline Matrimony on that Ac|count, being with re&s;pect to the Hazard of it, a Species of Gaming.</P>
<P>The Ladies are much obliged to you for be|ing their Advocate; all the Men of Honour will &s;urely be married immediately, there will &s;carce be a Girl left; for by the <HI>Ga&s;coon</HI> Story, you have plainly &s;hewn, that tho&s;e that marry, and have Families, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be Cowards; and yet I don't know how to think them &s;o, &s;ince they DARE <HI>marry.</HI></P>

<P>I would gladly know what End is attained by Matrimony; you &s;ay, and 'tis admitted, the Bat|chelor has had particular Favours granted him by the Fair Sex, and that he's no Novice to their Charms. What Excu&s;e has he then for Matri|mony? only an idle Curio&s;ity, to try whether the Plea&s;ures a Woman affords you, that has &s;ordidly tied you Neck and Heels in Loads of Parchments and Settlements, and who would have differ'd with you, if your E&s;tate had fell &s;hort of being adequate to her Fortune by 5l. a Year; whether tho&s;e Plea&s;ures are more refined, than tho&s;e of a truly generous-&s;pirited Girl, that obliges
<PB N="85" REF="127">
you without Signing and Sealing. And there's one Thing remarkable, that the latter neither expects nor de&s;ires your Affections any longer than &s;he, by her continuing agreeable, merits them; and in ca&s;e, as in all other fair Dealings, you don't like her, you are at your Liberty to act as you plea&s;e: But the former, in ca&s;e &s;he does not an|&s;wer the Sample of her Face, (the only one you are permitted to have) and proves di&s;agreeable, &s;he &s;ticks to you for Life; and, as if touched with Birdlime, the more you &s;truggle, the le&s;s you have Power &s;o to do.</P>
<P>But to return to my E&s;timate, I can't conceive why I &s;hould, as I find I have, made &s;o many of the Fair Sex my Enemies. Says one, I will certainly pull him by the No&s;e, another threatens to box my Ears, a third excludes me from the Tea-Table, I am forbid to make my u&s;ual Vi&s;its to them. But what is mo&s;t unrea|&s;onable, tho&s;e Viragoes I find are all out of the Ca&s;e, my E&s;timate has nothing to do with them; for their Fortunes are &s;o &s;mall, (exclu&s;ive of their own dear Per&s;ons, which &s;ome more amorous Gen|tlemen may think Fortune enough) that they won't bear to be e&s;timated: But did they but rightly con&s;ider, is it not more generous to re|frain, even tho' contrary to Inclination, as I propo&s;ed, till my Circum&s;tances can afford to
<PB N="86" REF="128">
maintain a Woman genteelly, than marry, and with both our Fortunes but ju&s;t barely &s;ub&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P>Did young Fellows before they marry, but coolly &s;it down and con&s;ider what they were go|ing about, and make proper E&s;timates, 'tis to be hoped the Number of mi&s;erable Wives, and un|provided Children, would be very much dimini&s;h'd. But in an&s;wer to all that can be alledg'd of the Expen&s;ivene&s;s of a married State, the Women cry out, the Plea&s;ures thereof are &s;o great, they are not to be rated according to any Expence, that attends the purcha&s;ing of them. 'Tis true, Batchelors <HI>are at a Lo&s;s</HI> to gue&s;s what they are; and if that will do the Fair Sex any Service, I will admit them very great, yea, next to tho&s;e of Heaven; for, like them, I am &s;ure they are <HI>in|conceivable.</HI></P>
<P>But now I think on't, why do I talk of marry|ing? I can have no Hopes of &s;uch Happine&s;s, each fair Lady is determined not to have the wicked calculating Batchelor, (tho' they'd do well to &s;tay till they are a&s;k'd) no, not if he was worth 50, 000 <HI>l.</HI> But why? becau&s;e he told the Truth. If that's to be the Ca&s;e, (tho' I don't &s;ay I will not have them if they were worth &s;o much) and I mu&s;t have NO WIFE, I &s;ay CONTENT; or to u&s;e the Words of a Great Man of the Law, BE IT SO.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="129">
From what I have &s;aid, I would not have you think I di&s;like Matrimony, or that I would ca&s;t an Odium on, or ridicule that State, as &s;ome mo|dern Batchelors do: Say they, Matrimony is like a hungry Dog and a Bone; no &s;ooner is the Bone found, but the Dog, wonderfully pleas'd with the Adventure, endeavours all he can to devour it; but alter the Po&s;ition of the Bone, take it and tie it to his Tail, the poor Creature runs from it with all his Speed, nor is he ea&s;y till he gets rid of it. Nor can I commend a Gentleman pretty well known in Town, that lay in almo&s;t the wor&s;t Condition the Gratification of a loo&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion could bring him to, who cry'd out in a faultering Tone to his Friend and Vi&s;itor, <HI>Even This,</HI> TOM, <HI>is better than Matrimony.</HI></P>
