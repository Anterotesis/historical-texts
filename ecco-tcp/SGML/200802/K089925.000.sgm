<L>WHAT various transformations we remark,</L>
<L>From Ea&s;t Whitechapel to the We&s;t Hyde-park!</L>
<L>Men, women, children, hou&s;es, &s;igns, and fa&s;hions,</L>
<L>State, &s;tage, trade, ta&s;te, the humours and the pa&s;&s;ions;</L>
<L>Th' Exchange, 'Change alley, where&s;oe'er your ranging,</L>
<L>Court, city, country, all are chang'd, or changing;</L>
<L>The &s;treets &s;ometime ago, were pav'd with &s;tones,</L>
<L>Which, aided by a hackney coach, half broke your bones.</L>
<L>The pure&s;t lovers then indulg'd no bli&s;s;</L>
<L>They run great hazard if they &s;tole a ki&s;s&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>One cha&s;te &s;alute&mdash;the Dam&s;el cry'd, O fye!</HI></L>
<L>As they approach'd, &s;lap went the coach awry,</L>
<L>&mdash;Poor Sylvia got a bump, and Damon a black eye.</L>
<L>But now weak nerves in hackney coaches roam,</L>
<L>And the cramm'd glutton &s;nores unjolted home:</L>
<L>Of former times that poli&s;h'd thing a <HI>Beau,</HI></L>
<L>Is metamorphos'd now, from top to toe;</L>
<L>Then the full flaxen wig, &s;pread o'er the &s;houlders,</L>
<L>Conceal'd the &s;hallow head from the beholders!</L>
<L>But now the whole's revers'd&mdash;each fop appears,</L>
<L>Cropp'd, and trimm'd up&mdash;expo&s;ing head and ears;</L>
<L>The buckle then it's mode&s;t limits knew&mdash;</L>
<L>Now, like the ocean, dreadful to the view,</L>
<L>Hath broke it's bounds, and &s;wallows up the &s;hoe;</L>
<L>The wearer's foot, like his once fine e&s;tate,</L>
<L>Is almo&s;t lo&s;t, th' <HI>incumbrance</HI> is &s;o great.</L>
<L>Ladies may &s;mile&mdash;are they not in the plot?</L>
<L>The bounds of nature have not they forgot?</L>
<L>Were they de&s;ign'd to be, when put together,</L>
<L>Made up, like &s;huttlecocks, of cork and feather?</L>
<L>Their pale fac'd grand-mama's appear'd with grace,</L>
<L>When dawning blu&s;hes ro&s;e upon the face;</L>
<L>No blu&s;hes now their once lov'd &s;tation &s;eek,</L>
<L>The foe is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cheek!</L>

No head of old, too high in feather'd &s;tate,</L>

<L>As change thus circulates throughout the nation,</L>

<P>Only by character&mdash;her father, Sir Tunbelly Clum&s;ey, lives within a quarter of a mile of this place, in a lonely old hou&s;e, which nobody comes

near. She never goes abroad, nor &s;ees company at home; to prevent all misfortunes, &s;he has her breeding within doors; the par&s;on of the pari&s;h teaches her to play upon the dulcimer; the clerk to &s;ing, her nur&s;e to dre&s;s, and her father to dance:&mdash;in &s;hort, nobody has free admi&s;&s;ion there but our old acquaintance, Mother Coupler, who has procured your brother this match, and is, I believe, a di&s;tant relation of Sir Tunbelly's.</P>

<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Tom, I am at pre&s;ent mo&s;t whim&s;ically circum&s;tanced&mdash;I came here near a month ago to meet the lady you mention; but &s;he failing in her promi&s;e, I, partly from pique, and partly from idlene&s;s, have been diverting my chagrin by of|fering up cha&s;te incen&s;e to the beauties of Amanda, our friend Lovele&s;s's wife.</P>

<P>She is &s;o indeed; and Lovele&s;s being too care|le&s;s and in&s;en&s;ible of the trea&s;ure he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es&mdash;my lodging in the &s;ame hou&s;e has given me a thou|&s;and opportunities of making my a&s;&s;iduities ac|ceptable; &s;o that in le&s;s than a fortnight, I began to bear my di&s;appointment from the widow, with the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian re&s;ignation.</P>

<P>O, a dance, and a bottle, Sir Tunbelly, by all means.</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR TUNBELLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had forgot the company below; well, what&mdash;we mu&s;t be merry then, ha?&mdash;and dance and drink, ha?&mdash;Well, 'fore George, you &s;han't &s;ay I do things by halves; &s;on-in-law there looks like a hearty rogue, &s;o we'll have a night of it; and which of the&s;e gay ladies will be the old man's partner, ha?&mdash;Ecod, I don't know how I came to be in &s;o good a humour.</P>

<SPEAKER>BERINTHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir Tunbelly, my friend and I both will endeavour to keep you &s;o; you have done a gene|rous action, and are entitled to our attention; and if you &s;hou'd be at a lo&s;s to divert your new gue&s;ts, we will a&s;&s;i&s;t you to relate to them the plot of your daughter's marriage, and his Lord&s;hip's de&s;erved mortification, a &s;ubject which, perhaps, may afford no bad evening's entertainment.</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR TUNBELLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Ecod, with all my heart; tho' I am a main bungler at a long &s;tory.</P>

<SPEAKER>BERINTHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, we will a&s;&s;i&s;t you, if the tale is judged worth being repeated; but of this you may be a&s;&s;ured, that while the intention is evi|dently to plea&s;e, Briti&s;h auditors will ever be in|dulgent to the errors of the performance.</P>
