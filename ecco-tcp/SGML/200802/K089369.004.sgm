<HEAD>LETTER I. From Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> to Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My deare&s;t Mrs.</HI> B.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WE are greatly obliged to you for every particular Article in your entertaining Journal, which you have brought &s;ooner than we wi&s;h'd to a Conclu&s;ion. We cannot expre&s;s how much we admire you for your judicious Charities, &s;o ea&s;y to be practi&s;ed, yet &s;o uncommon in the Manner; and for your inimitable Conduct in the Affair of your frail <HI>Polly,</HI> and the &s;illy Mr. <HI>H.</HI></P>
<P>Your Account of the Vi&s;it of the Four Rakes, and of your Parting with your noble Gue&s;ts; your Ver&s;es, and Mr. <HI>H.</HI>'s Letter, (an Original indeed!) have all greatly entertain'd us, as your Preroga|tive Hints have amus'd us: But we defer our Opi|nions of tho&s;e Hints, till we have the Ca&s;e more fully explain'd.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">But, my dear Friend, are you not in Danger of falling into a too thoughtful and gloomy way? By the latter Part of your Letter, we are afraid you are; and my Mamma, and Mrs. <HI>Jones,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Peters,</HI> injoin me to write, to caution you on that Head. But there is the le&s;s need of it, becau&s;e your Pru|dence will always &s;ugge&s;t to you Rea&s;ons, as it does in that very Letter, that mu&s;t out-balance your Fears. <HI>Think</HI> little, and <HI>hope</HI> much, is a good Le&s;&s;on in your Ca&s;e, and to a Lady of your Temper; and I hope Lady <HI>Davers</HI> will not in vain have given you that Caution. After all, I dare &s;ay, your Thoughtfulne&s;s is but &s;ymptomatical, and will go off, in proper Time.</P>
<P>Mean time, permit me to chu&s;e you a Subject, that will certainly divert you. You mu&s;t know, that I have been a diligent Ob&s;erver of the Conduct of People in the marry'd Life to each other, and have often pronounced, that there cannot be any tolera|ble Happine&s;s in it, unle&s;s the one or the other makes &s;uch Sacrifices of their Inclinations and Hu|mours, as renders it a State very little de&s;irable to free and generous Minds. Of this I &s;ee an In&s;tance in our own Family; for tho' my Papa and Mamma live very happily, it is all owing to one Side, I need not &s;ay which. And this, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e between Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and you: For you mu&s;t, even thro' Fire, if requir'd, &s;acrifice to <HI>Moloch.</HI> I know your Prudence will oblige you to make the be&s;t of it; and, like a contented good Wife, you will &s;ay, You have your own Will in every thing: A good Rea&s;on why, Becau&s;e you make your own Will his. This, long ago, we all decreed, any Lady mu&s;t do, be her Quality ever &s;o great, who would be happy with Mr. <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;Yet my Si&s;ter once hoped (<HI>entre nous</HI>) to be the Per&s;on. Fine Work would there have been between two &s;uch Spirits, you may be|lieve!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">But to wave this: Let me ask you, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> Is your Monarch's Conduct to you as <HI>re&s;pectful,</HI> I don't mean fond, when you are alone together, as when in Company?&mdash;Forgive me, Madam &mdash; But you have hinted two or three times, in your Letters, that he always is mo&s;t complai&s;ant to you in Company; and you ob&s;erve, that <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> does he act in this, Becau&s;e he thereby does Credit with every body to his own Choice. I make no doubt, that the many charming Scenes which your Genius and fine Behaviour furni&s;h out to him, mu&s;t, as often as they happen, in&s;pire him with Joy, and even Rap|ture; and mu&s;t make him love you more for your Mind than for your Per&s;on:&mdash;But the&s;e rapturous Scenes la&s;t very little longer than the pre&s;ent Mo|ment. What I want to know, is, Whether in the <HI>&s;teadier</HI> Parts of Life, when you are both nearer the Level of us common Folks, he gives up any thing of his own Will in Compliment to yours? Whether he acts the Part of a re&s;pectful, polite Gentleman, in his Behaviour to you; and breaks not into your Retirements, in the Dre&s;s, and with the brutal Rough|ne&s;s, of a Fox-hunter?&mdash;Making no Difference, perhaps, between the Field or his Stud, I will not &s;ay Kennel, and your Chamber or Clo&s;et?&mdash;Policy, for his own Credit-&s;ake, as I mention'd, accounts to me well, for his Complai&s;ance to you in Publick. But his regular and uniform Behaviour to you in your Retirements, when the Conver&s;ation between you turns upon u&s;ual and common Subjects, and you have not obliged him to ri&s;e to Admiration of you, by &s;uch Scenes as tho&s;e of your two Par&s;ons, Sir <HI>Jacob Swynford,</HI> and the like; are what would mo&s;t engage my Curio&s;ity, if you plea&s;e to give me an In&s;tance or two of it.</P>
<P>Now, my deare&s;t Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> if you can give me a Ca&s;e partly or nearly thus circum&s;tanced, you will highly oblige me:</P>
<P><PB REF="5">Fir&s;t, Where he has borne with &s;ome Infirmity of your own; and I know of none where you can be guilty of any, except you get into a vapouri&s;h Ha|bit, by giving way to a Temper too thoughtful and apprehen&s;ive:</P>
<P>Next, That, in Complai&s;ance to <HI>your</HI> Will, he re|cedes from <HI>his own,</HI> in any one In&s;tance:</P>
<P>Next, Whether he breaks not into your Retire|ments unceremoniou&s;ly, and without Apology or Concern; as I hinted above.</P>
<P>You know, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> all I mean, by what I have &s;aid; and if you have any pretty Conver&s;ation in Memory, where this my bold Curio&s;ity may be an&s;wer'd, pray oblige me with it; and we &s;hall be able to judge by it, not only of the inborn Genero|&s;ity which all that know Mr. <HI>B.</HI> have been willing to attribute to him, but of the Likelihood of the Con|tinuance of both your Felicities, upon Terms &s;uit|able to the Characters of a fine Lady and fine Gen|tleman; and, of con&s;equence, worthy of the Imita|tion of the mo&s;t delicate of our own Sex.</P>
<P>This is the Task your <HI>Polly Darnford</HI> pre&s;umes to &s;et to her beloved Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> And why? For your own Diver&s;ion, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place. For my Edification, in the <HI>next.</HI> And that when I have the Plea&s;ure I hope for, of attending you in <HI>London,</HI> I may &s;ee what there is in the Conduct of you both, to ad|mire, or to remon&s;trate again&s;t, in the <HI>Third.</HI> For, where there is &s;o little wanting to Perfection between you, I &s;hall be very free with you both, in my Cen|&s;ures, if he impo&s;es, thro' Prerogative, or you per|mit, thro' an undue Compliance, what I &s;hall ima|gine ought not to be in either Ca&s;e. I know, you will excu&s;e me for what I have &s;aid; and well you may, &s;ince I am &s;ure, I &s;hall have nothing to do, when I am with you, but to admire, and to imitate <HI>you</HI>; and to wi&s;h, if ever I marry, I may have ju&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="6">
&s;uch an Husband (tho' not quite &s;o haughty perhaps) as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> But pray, let not the lordly Man &s;ee this Letter, nor your An&s;wer, nor the Copy of it, till you may conclude I have the latter, if then; that you may not be under any undue Influences.</P>
<P>Your obliging <HI>Longings,</HI> my beloved dear Lady, for my Company, I hope, will be &s;oon, very &s;oon, an&s;wer'd. My Papa was &s;o plea&s;ed with your &s;weet Earne&s;tne&s;s on this Occa&s;ion, that he join'd with my Mamma, and both with equal Chearfulne&s;s, &s;aid, You &s;hould not be many Days in <HI>London</HI> before me. <HI>Murray</HI> and his Mi&s;tre&s;s go on &s;wimmingly, and have not yet had one Quarrel. The only Per&s;on, he, of either Sex, that ever knew <HI>Nancy</HI> &s;o intimately, and &s;o long, without one!</P>
<P>This is all I have to &s;ay, at pre&s;ent, when I have a&s;&s;ured you, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> how much I am</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your obliged and affectionate <HI>POLLY DANFORD.</HI></SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>I mu&s;t add, however, that I expect, from you, almo&s;t as many Letters as there are Po&s;t-Days, between this and the Time I &s;ee you; for I will not part with my Corre&s;pondent for any body; no, not for Lady <HI>Davers.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon your giving me the Con|ver&s;ation with the young Ladies related to Mrs. <HI>Towers</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Arthur.</HI></P>
<P>I will ob&s;erve every thing you &s;ay in relation to Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>; who is much as &s;he was, but not better.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My deare&s;t Mi&s;s</HI> Darnford,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was afraid I ended my la&s;t Letter in a gloomy way; and I am obliged to you for the kind and
<PB N="6" REF="7">
friendly Notice you take of it. It was owing to a Train of Thinking which &s;ometimes I get into, of late; I hope, only &s;ymptomatically, as you &s;ay, and that the Cau&s;e and Effect will &s;oon vani&s;h together.</P>
<P>But what a Task, my dear Mi&s;s, I'll warrant, you think you have &s;et me! I thought, in the Progre&s;s of my Journal, and in my Letters, I had gjven &s;o many In&s;tances of Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s polite Tenderne&s;s to me, that no new ones would be requir'd at my Hands; and when I &s;aid he was always <HI>mo&s;t</HI> complai&s;ant be|fore Company, I little expected, that &s;uch an Infe|rence would be drawn from my Words, as would tend to que&s;tion the Uniformity of his Behaviour to me, when there were no Witne&s;&s;es to it. But I am glad you give me an Opportunity to clear up all your Doubts on this Subject. To begin then,</P>
<P>You fir&s;t de&s;ire an In&s;tance, Where Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has borne with &s;ome Infirmity of mine:</P>
<P>Next, That in Complai&s;ance to my Will, he has receded from his own:</P>
<P>And, la&s;tly, Whether he breaks not into my Re|tirements unceremoniou&s;ly, and without Apology or Concern, making no Difference between the Field or the Stud, and my Chamber or Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>I know not, my dear Mi&s;s, what, the Di&s;tance is, at which the polite Ladies, and tho&s;e of Rank, think it proper to endeavour to keep their Husbands: But I will give you, by-and-by, the Subject of one Conver&s;ation only, which will an&s;wer all you mean, as I apprehend, and at the &s;ame time acquaint you with the Notions and Behaviour of us both, with re&s;pect to this Di&s;tance, and my Retirements; and then leave you to judge as you think fit.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, his bearing with my Infirmities, he is daily giving In&s;tances of his Goodne&s;s to me on this Head; and I am a&s;ham'd to &s;ay, that of late I give him &s;o much Occa&s;ion for them as I do: But
<PB N="7" REF="8">
he &s;ees my Apprehen&s;ivene&s;s, at times, tho' I endea|vour to conceal it; and no Husband was ever &s;o &s;oothing and &s;o indulgent as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> He gives me the be&s;t Advice, as to my Malady, if I may call it one: Treats me with redoubled Tenderne&s;s; talks to me upon the Subjects I mo&s;t delight to dwell upon; as of my worthy Parents; what they are doing at this time, and at that; of our intended Journey to <HI>London</HI>; of the Diver&s;ions of the Town; of Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s Company; and when he goes abroad, &s;ends up my good Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> to me, be|cau&s;e I &s;hould not be alone. At other times, takes me abroad with him; brings this Neighbour and that Neighbour to vi&s;it me; and carries me to vi&s;it them: Talks of our Journey to <HI>Kent,</HI> and into <HI>Lin|coln&s;hire,</HI> and to my Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s, to <HI>Bath,</HI> to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and I can't tell whither, when the appre||hended Time &s;hall be over&mdash;In fine, my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> you cannot imagine one half of his tender Goodne&s;s and Politene&s;s to me! Indeed you cannot!&mdash;Then, as to what you call <HI>re&s;pectful,</HI> he watches every Motion of my Eye, every Turn of my Countenance; &s;eldom gives his Opinion upon Subjects that he kindly imagines within my Capa|city, till he has heard mine; and I have the le&s;s Fear of falling into mean Compliances, becau&s;e his Genero&s;ity is my Guardian, and never fails to exalt me, more than I can deba&s;e my&s;elf, or than it is po&s;&s;ible I can de&s;erve. Then he hardly ever goes out to any Di&s;tance, but he brings me &s;ome pretty Pre&s;ent, that he thinks will be grateful to me: When at home, is &s;eldom out of my Company; delights to teach me <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> and reads me Pieces of manu&s;cript Poetry, in &s;everal of the modern Tongues (for he &s;peaks them all); explains to me every thing I under&s;tand not; delights to an&s;wer all my Que&s;tions, and to incourage my Inqui&s;itive|ne&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="9">
and Curio&s;ity; tries to give me a Notion of Pictures and Medals, and reads me Lectures upon them, for he has a fine Collection of both; and every now and then will have it, that he has been improved by my Que&s;tions and Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you to the&s;e things, my dear Mi&s;s? Do they come up to your fir&s;t Que&s;tion? or do they not? Or is not what I have &s;aid, a full An&s;wer, were I to &s;ay no more, to <HI>all</HI> your Inquiries? Can there be any &s;uch thing as <HI>undue Compliances</HI> to &s;uch an Husband, on my Side, think you? And when I have charm'd to &s;leep, by my grateful Duty, that watch|ful Dragon <HI>Prerogative,</HI> as Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> in one of her Letters, calls it; and am re&s;olved not to awake it, if I can help it, by the lea&s;t di&s;obliging or wil|fully perver&s;e Act, what have I to apprehend from it?</P>
<P>O my dear Mi&s;s, I am thoroughly convinc'd, that half the Mi&s;under&s;tandings among marry'd People, are owing to Trifles, to petty Di&s;tinctions, to mere Words, and little captious Follies, to Over-weenings, or unguarded Petulances: And who would forego the &s;olid Satisfactions of Life, for the &s;ake of tri|umphing in &s;uch poor Contentions, if one could tri|umph?</P>
<P>Are &s;uch Foibles as the&s;e to be dignify'd by the Name of <HI>Inclinations,</HI> and <HI>Humours,</HI> which, to be given up, would be making &s;uch a <HI>Sacrifice, as &s;hall render the married Life little de&s;irable to free and generous Minds?</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But &s;ay not, my dear Mi&s;s, to <HI>free</HI> and <HI>generous Minds:</HI> For every high Spirit de&s;erves not tho&s;e Epi|thets: Nor think what I &s;ay, a Partiality in behalf of my own Conduct, and an Argument for Tamene&s;s of Spirit, and &s;uch an one as would lick the Du&s;t; for, let me tell you, my dear Friend, that dearly as I love and honour my Mr. <HI>B.</HI> if he were to require
<PB N="9" REF="10">
of me any thing that I thought it was my Duty not to comply with, I &s;hould be the unhappie&s;t Crea|ture in the World; becau&s;e I am &s;ure I &s;hould with|&s;tand his Will, and de&s;ire him to excu&s;e my Com|pliance.</P>
<P>But then I would re&s;erve my Strength for the&s;e <HI>greater</HI> Points, and would never di&s;pute with him the <HI>&s;maller,</HI> altho' they were not intirely to my Like|ing: And this would give both Force and Merit to the Oppo&s;ition, when I found it nece&s;&s;ary: But to conte&s;t every little Point, where nothing but one's &s;tubborn Will was in the Que&s;tion, what an inex|cu&s;able Perver&s;ene&s;s would that be! How ready to enter the Li&s;ts again&s;t an Husband, would it make one appear to him? And where, be&s;ides, is the Me|rit of Obliging, were we only to yield to what will oblige our&s;elves?</P>
<P>But you next require of me an In&s;tance, where, in Complai&s;ance to <HI>my</HI> Will, he has receded from <HI>his own?</HI> I don't know, Mi&s;s, what to &s;ay to this. When Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is all Tenderne&s;s and Indulgence, as I have &s;aid, and requires of me nothing, that I can have a material Objection to; ought I <HI>not</HI> to oblige him? <HI>Can</HI> I have a Will, that is not his? Or would it be excu&s;able, if I <HI>had?</HI> All little Matters, as I have &s;aid, I chearfully give up: Great ones have not yet occurr'd between us, and I hope never will. One Point, indeed, I have &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion <HI>may</HI> hap|pen; and that, to be plain with you, is, We have had a Debate or two on the Subject (which I main|tain) of a Mother's Duty to nur&s;e her own Child; and, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, he &s;eems more determin'd than I wi&s;h he were, again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I hope it will not proceed &s;o far, as to awaken the &s;leeping Dragon I mention'd, <HI>Prerogative</HI> by Name; but I doubt I cannot give up this Point very contentedly: But as to le&s;&s;er Points, had I been
<PB N="10" REF="11">
a Duche&s;s born, I think I would not have conte&s;ted them with my Husband.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole of this Que&s;tion then, I have really had no Will of my own to contend for, &s;o generous is Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and &s;o ob&s;ervant and &s;o grateful have I thought it my Duty to be; yet I could give you many re&s;pectful In&s;tances, too, of his receding, when he has de&s;ir'd to &s;ee what I have been writing, and I have told him to whom, and begg'd to be ex|cus'd. One &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;tance I can give &s;ince I began this Letter. This is it.</P>
<P>I put it in my Bo&s;om, when he came up: He &s;aw me do &s;o.</P>
<P>Are you writing, my Dear, what I mu&s;t not &s;ee?</P>
<P>I am writing to Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> Sir; and &s;he, begg'd, you might not, at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>This augments my Curio&s;ity, <HI>Pamela.</HI> What can two &s;uch Ladies write, that I may not &s;ee?</P>
<P>If you won't be di&s;plea&s;ed, Sir, I had rather you would not, becau&s;e Mi&s;s de&s;ires you may not &s;ee her Letter, nor this my An&s;wer, till the latter is in her Hands.</P>
<P>Then I will not, return'd Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>Will this In&s;tance, my dear Mi&s;s, come up to your Demand for one, where he recedes from his own Will, in Complai&s;ance to mine?</P>
<P>But now, as to what both our Notions and our Practice are on the Article of my Retirements, and whether he breaks in upon them unceremoniou&s;ly, and without Apology, let the Conver&s;ation I pro|mi&s;ed, inform you, which began on the following Occa&s;ion:</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> rode out early one Morning, within a few Days pa&s;t, and did not return till the Afternoon, an Ab&s;ence I had not been u&s;ed to of late; and break|fa&s;ting and dining without him being al&s;o a new thing to me, I had &s;uch an Impatiency to &s;ee him, having
<PB N="11" REF="12">
expected him at Dinner, that I was forced to retire to my Clo&s;et, to try to divert it off, by writing; and the gloomy Conclu&s;ion of my la&s;t, was then the Subject. He return'd about Four o'Clock, and in|deed did <HI>not</HI> tarry to change his Riding-dre&s;s, as your Politene&s;s, my dear Friend, would perhaps have expected, but came directly up to me, with an Im|patiency to &s;ee me, equal to my own, when he was told, upon Inquiry, that I was in my Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>I heard his welcome Step, as he came up-&s;tairs; which generally, after a longer Ab&s;ence than I expect, has &s;uch an Effect upon my fond Heart, that it gives, a re&s;pon&s;ive Throb for every Step he takes towards me, and beats quicker and fa&s;ter, as he comes nearer and nearer, till, tapping my Brea&s;t, I &s;ay to it &s;ometimes, Lie &s;till, bu&s;y Fool as thou art! Can&s;t thou not forbear letting thy di&s;cerning Lord &s;ee thy non&s;en&s;ical Emotions? I love to in|dulge thee, in them, my&s;elf, 'tis true; but then let nobody el&s;e ob&s;erve them; for, generous as thy Ma&s;ter is, thou may&s;t not perhaps meet with &s;uch favourable Interpretations as thou de&s;erve&s;t, when thou art always fluttering thus, as he approaches, and playe&s;t off all thy little joyful Frolicks into the glowing Cheek, and brighten'd Eye, of thy Mi&s;tre&s;s; which makes her look, as if &s;he were con&s;cious of &s;ome Mi&s;demeanour; when all the time, it is nothing in the world but grateful Joy, and a Love &s;o inno|cent, that the pure&s;t Mind might own it.</P>
<P>This little Flutter and Chiding of the bu&s;y Sim|pleton, made me meet him but at the Clo&s;et-door, in&s;tead of the Entrance of my Chamber, as &s;ome|times I do.&mdash;So, my dear Love, how do you? folding his kind Arms about me, and &s;aluting me with Ardour. Whenever I have been but a few Hours from you, my Impatience to &s;ee my Beloved, will not permit me to &s;tand upon the Formality of a
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Me&s;&s;age to know how you are ingag'd; but I break in upon you, even in my Riding-dre&s;s, as you &s;ee.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, you are very obliging. But I have no Notion of <HI>mere</HI> Formalities of this kind (How unpo|lite this, my dear Mi&s;s, in your Friend!) in a married State; &s;ince 'tis impo&s;&s;ible a virtuous Wife can be imploy'd about any thing, that her Husband may not know; and &s;o need not fear Surprizes.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear you &s;ay this, my <HI>Pamela</HI>; for I have always thought the extraordinary Civilities and Di&s;tances of this kind, which I have ob&s;erved among &s;everal Per&s;ons of Rank, altogether unaccountable. For, if they are exacted by the Lady, I &s;hould &s;u|&s;pect &s;he had Re&s;erves, which &s;he her&s;elf believ'd I could not approve of. If not exacted, but practi&s;ed of Choice by the Gentleman, it carries with it, in my Opinion, a fal&s;e Air of Politene&s;s, little le&s;s than affrontive to the Lady, and di&s;honourable to him|&s;elf; for does it not look, as if he &s;uppo&s;ed, and <HI>allowed,</HI> that; probably, &s;he might be &s;o imployed, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to appri&s;e her of his Vi&s;it, left he &s;hould make Di&s;coveries not to her Credit, or his own?</P>
<P>One would not, Sir, (for I thought his Conclu|&s;ion too &s;evere) make &s;uch a har&s;h Suppo&s;ition as this, neither: For there are little Delicacies and Moments of Retirement, no doubt, in which a mode&s;t Lady would be glad to be indulged by the tendere&s;t Husband.</P>
<P>It may be &s;o, in an <HI>early</HI> Matrimony, before the Lady's Confidence in the Honour and Di&s;cretion of the Man &s;he has cho&s;en, has di&s;ingag'd her from her Bridal Re&s;erves.</P>
<P>Bridal Re&s;erves! dear Sir; permit me to give it, as my humble Opinion, That a Wife's Behaviour ought to be as pure and as circum&s;pect, in Degree, as that of a Bride, or even of a maiden Lady, be her Con|fidence
<PB N="13" REF="14">
in her Husband's Honour and Di&s;cretion, ever &s;o great. For, indeed, I think, a gro&s;s or a carele&s;s Demeanour little becomes that Mode&s;ty, which is the peculiar Excellency and Di&s;tinction of our Sex.</P>
<P>You account very well, my Dear, by what you now &s;ay, for your own over-nice Behaviour, as I have &s;ometimes thought it. But are we not all apt to argue for a Practice we make our own, becau&s;e we <HI>do</HI> make it our own, rather than from the Rea&s;on of the Thing?</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, that is not the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e with me; for, permit me to &s;ay, That an over-free or negli|gent Behaviour in a Lady in the marry'd State, mu&s;t be a Mark of Di&s;re&s;pect to her Con&s;ort; and would &s;hew, as if &s;he was very little &s;olicitous about what Appearance &s;he made in his Eye. And mu&s;t not this beget in him, a &s;light Opinion of her, and her Sex too, as if, &s;uppo&s;ing the Gentleman had been a free Liver, &s;he would convince him, there was no other Difference in the Sex, but as they were with|in or without the Pale; licens'd by the Law, or act|ing in Defiance of it?</P>
<P>I under&s;tand the Force of your Argument, <HI>Pamela.</HI> But you was going to &s;ay &s;omething more.</P>
<P>Only, Sir, permit me to add, That when, in my particular Ca&s;e, you injoin me to appear before you always <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 207, 214.</NOTE> dre&s;s'd, even in the early Part of the Day, it would be wrong, if I was le&s;s regardful of my Be|haviour and Actions, than of my Appearance.</P>
<P>I believe you are right, my Dear, if a preci&s;e or unnece&s;&s;ary Scrupulou&s;ne&s;s be avoided, and where all is unaffected, ea&s;y, and natural, as in my <HI>Pamela.</HI> For I have &s;een marry'd Ladies, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> who have kept a Husband at greater Di&s;tance, than they have exacted from &s;ome of his
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Sex, who have been more intitled to his Re&s;entment, than to his Wife's Intimacies.</P>
<P>But to wave a Subject, in which, as I can with Plea&s;ure &s;ay, neither of us have much Concern, tell me, my Deare&s;t, how you were imploy'd before I came up? Here are Pen and Ink: Here too is, Paper; but it is as &s;potle&s;s as your Mind: To whom was you directing your Favours now? May I not know your Subject?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H</HI>'s Letter was a Part of it; and &s;o I had put it by, at his Approach; and not chu&s;ing he &s;hould &s;ee that; I am writing, reply'd I, to Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford:</HI> But I think you mu&s;t not ask me to &s;ee what I have, written <HI>this</HI> time. I put it a&s;ide, that you &s;hould not, when I heard your welcome Step. The Sub|ject is our parting with our noble Gue&s;ts; and a little of my Apprehen&s;ivene&s;s, on an Occa&s;ion upon which our Sex may write to one another; but, for &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons we have been mentioning, Gentlemen &s;hould not de&s;ire to &s;ee.</P>
<P>Then I will not, my deare&s;t Love (So here, Mi&s;s, is another In&s;tance&mdash;I could give you an hun|dred &s;uch,&mdash;of his receding from his own Will, in Complai&s;ance to mine): Only, continued he, let me warn you again&s;t too much Apprehen&s;ivene&s;s, for your own &s;ake, as well as mine; for &s;uch a Mind, as my <HI>Pamela</HI>'s, I cannot permit to be habitually over|clouded. And yet there now hangs upon your Brow an Over-thoughtfulne&s;s, which you mu&s;t not in|dulge.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I was a little too thoughtful, from my Subject, before you came; but your Pre&s;ence, like the Sun, has di&s;&s;ipated the Mi&s;ts that hung upon my Mind. See you not, and I pre&s;s'd his Hand with my Lips, they are all gone already? &s;miling upon him, with a Delight unfeigned.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">Not quite, my obliging Charmer; and therefore, if you have no Objection, I will change my Dre&s;s, and attend you in the Chariot for an Hour or two, whither you plea&s;e, that not one Shadow may remain vi&s;ible in this dear Face. And then he &s;aluted me with Ardour.</P>
<P>Whither you plea&s;e, Sir. A little Airing with you, will be highly agreeable to me.</P>
<P>The dear Obliger went and chang'd his Dre&s;s in an In&s;tant; and he led me to the Chariot, with his u&s;ual tender Politene&s;s, and we had a charming Air|ing of &s;everal Miles; returning quite happy, chear|ful, and delighted with each other's Conver&s;ation, without calling in upon any of our good Neigh|bours: For what need of that, my dear Mi&s;s, when we could be the be&s;t Company in the World to each other?</P>
<P>Now, Mi&s;s, do the&s;e In&s;tances come up to your Que&s;tions? Do they, or do they not?&mdash;If you think not, I could give you our Conver&s;ation in the Chariot; for I wrote it down, at my fir&s;t Lei&s;ure, &s;o highly was I delighted with it: For the Subject was my deare&s;t Parents; a Subject &s;tarted by him|&s;elf, becau&s;e he knew it would oblige me. But be|ing tir'd with writing, I may re&s;erve it, till have the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, if you think it worth asking for. And &s;o I will ha&s;ten to a Conclu&s;ion of this long Letter.</P>
<P>You will perceive, my dear Mi&s;s, by what I have written, in what Sen&s;e it may be <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> &s;aid, That Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is <HI>mo&s;t</HI> complai&s;ant to me before Company, perhaps, politically, as you &s;ay, to do Credit to his own generous Choice:&mdash;But that he is more ten|der, yea, <HI>re&s;pectfully</HI> tender, (for that's the Word with you) and not le&s;s polite to me, in our retired Hours, you will have no Doubt, from what I have related; and could further relate, if it was nece&s;&s;ary: For
<PB N="16" REF="17">
every Day produces In&s;tances equal to what I have given you.</P>
<P>Then, my dear Mi&s;s, let me &s;ay to you, what I could not &s;o freely &s;ay to any other young Lady; That I never could have hoped I &s;hould be &s;o happy as I am, in other Particulars, from a Gentleman who has given him&s;elf the Liberties Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has done: For I never hear from him, in Company, or when alone, the lea&s;t &s;hocking Expre&s;&s;ion, or &s;uch frothy Je&s;ts, as tend to convey impure Ideas to the mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive Mind. There is indeed the le&s;s Won|der in this, and that we can glory in a true conju|gal Cha&s;tity, as I have the Vanity to think, his Love, as well as my own, is the Love of the Mind, rather than that of Per&s;on; and our tendere&s;t and mo&s;t affecting Moments, are tho&s;e which lift us up above Sen&s;e, and all that Sen&s;e can imagine. But this is a Subject too delicate to be dwelt upon, even to you: And you'll better comprehend all I mean, when your pure Mind meets with a Gentleman of exalted Sen&s;e, like Mr. <HI>B.</HI> whom, if you <HI>find</HI> not &s;o good as you wi&s;h, your Example will <HI>make</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>Permit me to add, for the &s;ake of you, my dear Parents, as well as for tho&s;e of my much-re&s;pected Friends, who have join'd in the kind Caution you give me, my dear Mi&s;s, again&s;t getting into too thoughtful and gloomy a way, that there is no great Fear, that I &s;hould continue long in it, when I have &s;o kind and &s;o generous a Comforter as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> For, at his Pre&s;ence, all my fearful Apprehen&s;ions are di&s;&s;ipated, and vani&s;h like a Morning Dream. And depend upon it, that &s;o &s;ure as the Day &s;uc|ceeds to the Night, &s;o &s;ure will my Mind, while capable of the lea&s;t Sen&s;e of Gratitude, be illumi|nated the Moment he &s;hines out upon me, let it be ever &s;o over-ca&s;t in his Ab&s;ence, thro' imaginary Doubts and apprehended Evils.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">I have only further to add, for my Comfort, that next <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Sev'nnight, if nothing hinders, we are to &s;et out for <HI>London.</HI> And why do you think I &s;ay <HI>for my Comfort?</HI> Only that I &s;hall then &s;oon have the Opportunity, to a&s;&s;ure you per&s;onally, as you give me Hope, how much I am, my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Mi&s;s,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ONE more Letter, and I have done for a great while; becau&s;e I hope your Pre&s;ence will put an End to the Occa&s;ion. I &s;hall now tell you of my &s;econd Vi&s;it to the Dairy-hou&s;e, where we went to Breakfa&s;t, in the Chariot and Four, becau&s;e of the Di&s;tance, which is Ten pretty long Miles.</P>
<P>I tran&s;crib'd for you, from Letters written for|merly to my dear Parents, an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 359.</NOTE> Account of my for|mer Dairy-hou&s;e Vi&s;it, and what the People were, and whom I &s;aw there; and altho' I be&s;ought you to keep that Affair to your&s;elf, as too touching a Point to the Reputation of my Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to be known but to you only, and even to de&s;troy it, when you had peru&s;ed it; yet, I make no doubt, you remember the Story, and &s;o I need not repeat any Part of that Account.</P>
<P>When we arrived there, we found at the Door, expecting us, (for they heard the Chariot-wheels at a Di&s;tance) my pretty Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> accompanied by two other Mi&s;&s;es, who had earned their Ride, and
<PB N="18" REF="19">
attended by the Governe&s;s's Daughter, a di&s;creet young Gentlewoman. As &s;oon as I &s;tepp'd out, Mi&s;s|ran into my Arms with great Eagerne&s;s, and I as ten|derly embraced her, and leading her into the Par|lour, asked her abundance of Que&s;tions about her Work, and her Le&s;&s;ons; and among the re&s;t, If &s;he had merited this Di&s;tinction of the Chai&s;e and Dairy-hou&s;e Breakfa&s;t, or if it were owing to her Uncle's Favour, and to that of her Governe&s;s? The young Gentlewoman a&s;&s;ur'd me it was to both, and &s;hew'd me Mi&s;s's Needleworks, and Penman&s;hip, and the Child was highly plea&s;ed with my Commendations.</P>
<P>I took a good deal of Notice of the other two Mi&s;&s;es, for thair Schoolfellow's &s;ake, and made each of them a Pre&s;ent of &s;ome little Toys; and my Mi&s;s, of a Number of pretty Trinkets, with which &s;he was highly delighted, and I told her, that I would wait upon her Governe&s;s, when I came from <HI>London</HI> into the Country again, and &s;ee in what Order &s;he kept her little Matters; for, above all things, I loved pretty hou&s;ewi&s;ely Mi&s;&s;es; and then, I would bring her more.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> ob&s;erv'd, with no &s;mall Satisfaction, the Child's Behaviour, which is very pretty, and appeared as fond of her, as if he had been <HI>more</HI> than her <HI>Uncle,</HI> and yet &s;eemed under &s;ome Re&s;traint, le&s;t it &s;hould be taken, that he <HI>was.</HI> Such Power has &s;ecret Guilt, poor dear Gentleman! to le&s;&s;en and re&s;train a Plea&s;ure, that would, in a happier Light, have been &s;o laudable to have manife&s;ted! But how commendable is this his Love to the dear Child, compar'd to that of mo&s;t wicked Libertines, who have no Delight, but in de&s;troying Innocence; and care not what becomes of the unhappy Infant, or of the &s;till more unhappy Mother!</P>
<P>I am going to let you into a charming Scene, re&s;ulting from this Perplexity of the dear Gentleman
<PB N="19" REF="20">
A Scene that has afforded me high Delight ever &s;ince; and always will, when I think of it: But I will lead to it, as gradually as it happen'd.</P>
<P>The Child was very fond of her Uncle, and told him, She loved him dearly, and always would love and honour him, for giving her &s;uch a good Aunt. &mdash;You talked, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, when I &s;aw you before, that I &s;hould come and live with you&mdash; Will you let me, Madam? Indeed I will be very good, and do every thing you bid me, and mind my Book, and my Needle; indeed I will.</P>
<P>Ask your Uncle, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s, &s;aid I; I &s;hould like your pretty Company of all things.</P>
<P>She went to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and &s;aid, Shall I, Sir, go and live with my Aunt? Pray let me, when you come from <HI>London</HI> again.</P>
<P>You have a very good Governe&s;s, Mi&s;s, &s;aid he; and &s;he can't part with you.</P>
<P>Yes, but &s;he can, Sir; &s;he has a great many Mi&s;&s;es, and can &s;pare me well enough; and if you plea&s;e to let me ride in your Coach &s;ometimes, I can go and vi&s;it my Governe&s;s, and beg a Holiday for the Mi&s;&s;es, now-and-then, when I am almo&s;t a Woman, and then all the Mi&s;&s;es will love me.</P>
<P>Don't the Mi&s;&s;es love you now, Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin?</HI> &s;aid he. Yes, they love me well-enough, for mat|ter of that; but they'll love me better, when I can beg them a Holiday. Do, dear Sir, let me go home to my new Aunt, next time you come into the Country.</P>
<P>I was much plea&s;ed with the dear Child's Earne&s;t|ne&s;s; and permitted her to have her full Argument with her beloved Uncle; but was much moved, and he him&s;elf was under &s;ome Concern, when the dear Mi&s;s &s;aid,&mdash;But you &s;hould, in Pity, let me live with you, Sir; for I have no Papa, nor Mamma neither: They are &s;o far off!&mdash;But I will love
<PB N="20" REF="21">
you both as if you were my own Papa and Mamma; &s;o, dear now, my good Uncle, promi&s;e the poor Girl that has never a Papa nor Mamma!&mdash;</P>
<P>I withdrew to the Door: It will rain, I believe, &s;aid I, and looked up. And, indeed, I had almo&s;t a Shower in my Eye; and had I kept my Place, could not have refrained &s;hewing how much I was affected.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> as I &s;aid, was a little mov'd; but for fear the young Gentlewoman &s;hould take notice of it, How! my Dear, &s;aid he, No Papa and Mamma!&mdash; Did they not &s;end you a pretty Black Boy to wait upon you, a while ago? Have you forgot that?&mdash; That's true, reply'd Mi&s;s: But what's a Black Boy to living with my new Aunt?&mdash;That's better a great deal than a Black Boy! Indeed it is.</P>
<P>Well, your Aunt and I will con&s;ider of it, when we come from <HI>London.</HI> Be a good Girl, mean time, and do as your Governe&s;s would have you, and then you don't know what we may do for you! Well then, Mi&s;s <HI>Bett,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to her young Governe&s;s, let me be &s;et two Tasks in&s;tead of one, and I will learn all I can, to de&s;erve to go to my Aunt.</P>
<P>In this manner the little Prattler diverted her&s;elf. And as we returned from them, the Scene I hinted at, open'd as follows:</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, What a poor Figure does the proude&s;t Mind make, my dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> under the Sen&s;e of a concealed Guilt, in Company of the Innocent who know it, and tho&s;e who do not! Even the ca&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ion of a Baby &s;hall &s;trike back Shame upon a guilty Heart, and make one unable to look up without Confu&s;ion. I blu&s;h'd for my&s;elf, continued he, to &s;ee how you was affected for me, and yet withdrew, to avoid reproaching me &s;o much as with your Eye; for then, the whole Power of Innocence, triumphing over my Guilt,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
how like a Fool I look'd! Surely I made a mo&s;t contemptible Figure, <HI>Pamela!</HI>&mdash;Did you not di&s;|dain me, at that Moment?</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Sir! how can you &s;peak &s;uch a Word? A Word I cannot repeat after you! For at that very Time, I beheld you with the more Reverence, for &s;eeing your noble Heart touch'd with a Sen&s;e of your Error; and it was &s;uch an Earne&s;t to me of the happie&s;t Change I could ever wi&s;h for, and in &s;o young a Gentleman, that it was one half Joy for that, and the other half Concern at the little Charmer's accidental Plea, to her be&s;t and neare&s;t Friend, for coming home to her hew Aunt, that affected me &s;o &s;en&s;ibly as you &s;aw.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not talk to me of the Child's coming home, after this Vi&s;it, <HI>Pamela</HI>; for how, at this rate, &s;hall I &s;tand the Reproaches of my own Mind, were I to &s;ee the little Prater every Day before me, and to think of what her poor Mamma has &s;uffered on my Account! 'Tis enough, that in <HI>you,</HI> my Dear, I have an hourly Reproach before me, for my At|tempts on your Virtue; and I have nothing to boa&s;t, but that I gave way to your Triumphs: And what then is my Boa&s;t?</P>
<P>What is your Boa&s;t, deare&s;t sir? You have every thing to boa&s;t, that is worthy of being boa&s;ted of: &mdash;Brought up to an affluent Fortune, uncontroul|able in your Will, your Pa&s;&s;ions unbridled; God has touched your truly noble Heart, and you have &s;een your Error, at a Time of Life, when others are ru&s;hing into Vices, in the mid&s;t of which, perhaps, they are cut off.</P>
<P>You act generou&s;ly, and with a laudable Affection, to a de&s;erving Baby, which &s;ome would have left friendle&s;s to the wide World, and have made more mi&s;erable, perhaps, than they had made the very mi&s;erable Mother: And you have the Comfort to
<PB N="22" REF="23">
think, that thro' God's Goodne&s;s, this <HI>Mother</HI> is not unhappy; and that there is not a lo&s;t <HI>Soul,</HI> any more than a lo&s;t <HI>Body,</HI> to lay to your Charge.</P>
<P>You have in&s;pirited, by your generous Example, and inabled, by your &s;plendid Fortune, another Per|&s;on, whom you have made the happie&s;t Creature in the World, to do more Good, if &s;he may &s;ay &s;o with|out Vanity, than Twenty wicked Libertines have done Mi&s;chief; be&s;ides making every one, that ap|proaches you, ea&s;y and happy, with the Bounty of your own Hands.</P>
<P>You are the be&s;t of Husbands, the be&s;t of Land|lords, the be&s;t of Ma&s;ters, the be&s;t of Friends; and with all the&s;e Excellencies, and a Mind, as I hope, continually improving, and more and more affected with the Sen&s;e of its pa&s;t Mi&s;takes, will you ask, dear Sir, What is your Boa&s;t?</P>
<P>O my deare&s;t, dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and then I pre&s;s'd his Hand with my Lips, whatever you are to your&s;elf, when you give way to Reflections &s;o hopeful, you are the Glory and the Boa&s;t of your grateful <HI>Pamela!</HI> And permit me to add, Tears &s;tanding in my Eyes, and holding his Hand between mine, That I never beheld you in my Life, in a more amiable Light, than when I &s;aw your manly Countenance manife&s;t|ing the Struggle your Heart labour'd with, as it &s;eem'd to me, between Grace and Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. O Sir! this was a Sight of Joy, of true Joy! to one who loves you for your dear Soul's &s;ake, more than for that of your Per&s;on; and who looks forward to a Companion&s;hip with you, beyond the Term of this tran&s;itory Life!</P>
<P>The dear Gentleman look'd down &s;ometimes, and &s;ometimes upon me, without offering to interrupt me; and when I had done &s;peaking, I began to fear, by his Silence, that I had offended him, remember|ing,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
ju&s;t then, one of his former <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 156.</NOTE> Cautions to me, not to throw a Gloom, by my Over-&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, upon his innocent Injoyments; and I &s;aid, putting my Arms round his Arm, as I fat, my fearful Eye watching his, I fear, Sir, I have been too &s;erious! I have perhaps broken one of your Injunctions! Have ca&s;t a Gloomine&s;s over your Mind! And if I have, dear Sir, forgive me!</P>
<P>He cla&s;ped his Arm around me: O my beloved <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he; thou dear Augmenter of my Ho|nour! and Confirmer of all my better Purpo&s;es! how &s;hall I acknowlege (for reward I never can) your inexpre&s;&s;ible Goodne&s;s to me? I &s;ee every Day more and more, my dear Love, what Confidence I may repo&s;e in your Genero&s;ity and Di&s;cretion! You want no Forgivene&s;s; and my Silence was owing to much better Motives, than to tho&s;e you were apprehen&s;ive of.</P>
<P>Judge ye, my honoured Parents, and you, my dear Mi&s;s, the Joy that over&s;pread my Heart, incouraged in a manner &s;o agreeable to all my Wi&s;hes. O Sir, Sir! &s;aid I, after a &s;hort Pau&s;e, your Goodne&s;s had &s;truck me dumb for a Moment; but my Silence could hold but for that Moment: For had I been naturally dumb, and never &s;poken before, my Joy for this your Kindne&s;s, and the futute Hope you rai&s;e in my Brea&s;t, would have unbarr'd the Doors of my Speech, or my Heart would have been made vocal, had my Tongue remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Forgive me, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s, the&s;e &s;lightly Ex|pre&s;&s;ions: I know they are above my&s;elf, and per|haps out of Nature; but &s;o, in a manner, was your Friend, when &s;he &s;poke them. If ever it be your Lot to marry &s;uch a Gentleman as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> one Who is capable of generous and noble Sentiments, and
<PB N="24" REF="25">
yet has not been &s;o good as you wi&s;h him to be, whenever it &s;hall happen, that the Divine Grace, and your Example, &s;hall touch his Heart, and awa|ken his better Faculties, you'll then know a Joy like this which I have de&s;cribed; which will not only exalt your Heart and Speech, but, upon Reflection, will irradiate many a gloomy Apprehen&s;ion, that, at times, will ca&s;t a Shadow over the brighte&s;t and happie&s;t Pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>The Chariot brought us home &s;ooner than I wi&s;h|ed, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> handed me into the Parlour. Here, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid he, meeting her in the Pa&s;&s;age, receive your Angel-Lady. I mu&s;t take a little Tour without you, <HI>Pamela</HI>; for I have had <HI>too much</HI> of your dear Company, and mu&s;t leave you, to de&s;cend again into my&s;elf; for you have rai&s;ed me to &s;uch a Pitch, that it is with Pain I bear it.</P>
<P>He ki&s;&s;ed my Hand, and went into his Chariot again; for it was but half an Hour after Twelve, and &s;aid, he would be back by Two, at Dinner.

<P>I Know you will be plea&s;ed to hear, that we ar|rived &s;afely in Town la&s;t Night. We found a &s;tately, well-furni&s;h'd, and convenient Hou&s;e; and I had my Clo&s;et, or Library, and my Withdrawing-room, all in complete Order, which Mr. <HI>B.</HI> gave me Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, in a manner the mo&s;t obliging that can be imagined.</P>
<P>I am in a new World, as I may &s;ay, and &s;ee &s;uch va&s;t Piles of Building every-where, and &s;uch a Con|cour&s;e of People, and hear &s;uch a Rattling of Coaches in the Day, that I hardly know what to make of it, as yet. Then the nightly Watch, going their hourly Rounds, di&s;turbed me la&s;t Night. But I &s;hall &s;oon be us'd to that, and &s;leep the &s;ounder perhaps, for the Security it a&s;&s;ures to us.</P>

<P>I am impatient for the Arrival of my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>; who&s;e Company and Conver&s;ation will reconcile me, in a great mea&s;ure, to this new World.</P>
<P>Our Family, at pre&s;ent, are Mr. <HI>Colbrand,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and &s;ix Men-&s;ervants, including the Coachman. The four Maids are al&s;o with us.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. From Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> to Lady <HI>Davers.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Mu&s;t beg Pardon, for having been in this great Town, more than a Week, and not having found an Opportunity to tender my Devoirs to your Lady|&s;hip. You know, dear Madam, what Hurries and Fatigues mu&s;t attend &s;uch a Journey, to one in my way, and to an intire new Settlement, in which an hundred things mu&s;t be done, and attended to, with a Preference to other Occa&s;ions, however delight|ful. Yet, I mu&s;t own, we found a &s;tately, a well-order'd, and a convenient Hou&s;e: But although it is not far from Fields, and has an airy Opening to its back Part, and its Front a Square, as it is called, yet I am not reconcil'd to it, &s;o intirely as to the be|loved Man&s;ion we left.</P>
<P>My dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has been, and is, bu&s;ily im|ploy'd in ordering &s;ome few Alterations, to make things &s;till more commodious. He has furni&s;h'd me out a little pretty Library; and has allotted me very
<PB N="28" REF="29">
convenient Apartments be&s;ides: And the Furniture of every Place is rich, as befits the Mind and For|tune of the generous Owner. But I &s;hall not offer at Particulars, becau&s;e we hope to have the Honour of a Vi&s;it from my good Lord, and your Lady&s;hip, before the Winter Weather &s;ets in, to make the Roads too dirty and deep; but it is proper to mention, that the Hou&s;e is &s;o large, that we make a great Number of Beds, the more conveniently to receive the Honours your Lady&s;hip, and my Lord, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s other Friends will do us.</P>
<P>I have not yet been at any of the publick Di|ver&s;ions. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has carry'd me, by gentle Turns, out of his Workmens way, Ten Miles round this over-grown Capital, and through the principal of its numerous Streets. The Villages, that lie &s;pangled about this va&s;t Circumference, as well on the other Side the noble <HI>Thames,</HI> (which I had before a Notion of, from Sir <HI>John Denbam</HI>'s celebrated <HI>Cooper's Hill</HI>) as well as on the <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> Side, are beautiful, both by Buildings and Situation, beyond what I could con|ceive, and &s;everal of them &s;eem larger than many of our Country Towns of Note. But it would be impertinent to trouble your Lady&s;hip with the&s;e Matters, who are no Stranger to what is worthy of Notice in <HI>London.</HI> But I was &s;urpris'd, when Mr. <HI>B.</HI> ob&s;erved to me, that this whole County, and the Two Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> are repre&s;ented by no more than Eight Members of Parliament, when &s;o many Borough Towns in <HI>England</HI> are inferior to the meane&s;t Villages about <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I am in daily Expectation of the Arrival of Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> and then I &s;hall wi&s;h (accompanied by a young Lady of &s;o polite a Ta&s;te) to &s;ee a good Play. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has already &s;hewn me the Opera-hou&s;e, and the Two Play-hou&s;es, tho' &s;ilent, as I may &s;ay; that, as he was plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, they &s;hould not be
<PB N="29" REF="30">
new to me, and that the Sight might not take off my Attention to the Performance, when I went to the Play: So that I can conceive a tolerable Notion of every thing, from the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Seats, the Boxes, the Galleries, the Pit, the Mu&s;ick, the Scenes, and the Stage; and &s;o &s;hall have no Occa&s;ion to gaze about me like a Country Novice, whereby I might attract a Notice, that I &s;hould not with, either for my own Credit, or your dear Brother's Honour.</P>
<P>I have had a Plea&s;ure, which I wi&s;hed for, and had not in <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI>; and that is, that on <HI>Sunday</HI> I was at Church, without gaping Crouds to attend us, and Wi&s;hes too loud for my own. Yet, I was more gaz'd at, (and &s;o was Mr. <HI>B.</HI>) than I expected, con|&s;idering there were &s;o many well-dre&s;s'd Gentry, and &s;ome Nobility there; and <HI>they</HI> &s;tar'd as much as any body; but will not do &s;o, I hope, when we cea&s;e to be a Novelty.</P>
<P>We have already had &s;everal Vi&s;itors to welcome Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to Town, and to congratulate him on his Marriage;&mdash;but &s;ome, no doubt, to &s;ee, and to find Fault with, his Ru&s;tick; for it is impo&s;&s;ible, you know, Madam, that a Gentleman &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd by his Merit and Fortune, &s;hould have taken a Step of &s;uch Con&s;equence to him&s;elf and Family, and not be known by every body &s;o to have done.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Atkyns</HI> is in Town, and has taken Apartments in the new-built &s;tately Pile of Edifices, called <HI>Hanover|&s;quare</HI>; and he brought with him a younger Brother of Mr. <HI>Arthur</HI>'s who, it &s;eems, is a Merchant.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>F.</HI> has been to pay his Re&s;pects to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> likewi&s;e, who&s;e School-fellow he was <HI>Eaton,</HI> the little time Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was there. His Lord&s;hip pro|mi&s;es, that his Lady &s;hall make me a Vi&s;it, and ac|company me to the Opera, as &s;oon as we are fully &s;ettled.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">A Gentleman of the <HI>Temple,</HI> Mr. <HI>Turner</HI> by Name, and Mr. <HI>Fan&s;haw,</HI> of <HI>Grey's-Inn</HI> both Lawyers, and of Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s former Acquaintance, very &s;prightly and modi&s;h Gentlemen, have al&s;o welcom'd us to Town, and made Mr. <HI>B.</HI> abundance of gay Compliments on my account, to my Face, all in the common frothy Run.&mdash;</P>
<P>They may be polite Gentlemen; but I can't &s;ay, I over-much like them.&mdash;There is &s;omething &s;o forward, &s;o opinionated, &s;o &s;eemingly in&s;en&s;ible of Rebuke, either from <HI>within</HI> or <HI>without,</HI> and yet not promi&s;ing to avoid de&s;erving one occa&s;ionally, that I could as <HI>lieve</HI> wi&s;h Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and they would not re|new their former Acquaintance.</P>
<P>I am very bold, your Lady&s;hip will &s;ay?&mdash;But you command me to write freely: Yet I would not he thought to be unea&s;y, with regard to your dear Brother's Morals, from the&s;e Gentlemen; for, Oh, Madam, I am a ble&s;&s;ed Creature, and am hourly happier and happier in the Confidence I have as to that Particular: But I imagine they will force them|&s;elves upon him, more than he him&s;elf may wi&s;h, or would permit, were the Acquaintance now to begin; for they are not of his Turn of Mind, as it &s;eems to me; being, by a Sentence or two that dropt from them, very free, and very frothy, in their Conver&s;ation; and by their laughing at what they &s;ay them&s;elves, taking that for Wit, which will not &s;tand the Te&s;t, if I may be allow'd to &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>But they have heard, no doubt, what a Character Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Goodne&s;s to me, has lifted into Notice; and they think them&s;elves warranted to &s;ay any thing before his Country Girl.</P>
<P>He was plea&s;ed to ask me, when they were gone, How I liked his two Lawyers? And &s;aid, they were Per&s;ons of Family and Fortune.</P>
<P>I am glad of it, Sir, &s;aid I; for their own &s;akes.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">Then you don't approve of them, <HI>Pamela?</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>They are <HI>your</HI> Friends, Sir; and I cannot have any Di&s;like to them.</P>
<P>They &s;ay good Things <HI>&s;ometimes,</HI> returned he.</P>
<P>I don't doubt it, Sir: But you &s;ay good Things <HI>always.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis happy for me, my Dear, you think &s;o. But tell me; What think you of 'em?</P>
<P>I &s;hall be better able, Sir, to an&s;wer your Que|&s;tion, if I &s;ee them a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>But we form Notions of Per&s;ons, at fir&s;t Sight, &s;ometimes, my Dear; and you are &s;eldom mi&s;taken in yours.</P>
<P>I only think, Sir, That they have neither of them any Diffidence: But their Profe&s;&s;ion, perhaps, may, &s;et them above that.</P>
<P>They don't <HI>practi&s;e,</HI> my Dear; their Fortunes re|quire it not of them; and they are too &s;tudious of their Plea&s;ures, to give them&s;elves any Trouble they are not oblig'd to take.</P>
<P>They &s;eem to me, Sir, to be <HI>qualified</HI> for Pra|&s;tice: They would make great Figures at the Bar, I fan&s;y.</P>
<P>Why &s;o?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, Sir, they &s;eem, if I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;peak, Gentle|men of great Elocution!&mdash;</P>
<P>How do you di&s;cover that, my Dear?&mdash;</P>
<P>Only, that they &s;eem prepared to think <HI>well</HI> of what they &s;hall &s;ay <HI>them&s;elves</HI>; and <HI>lightly</HI> of what <HI>other People</HI> &s;ay, or may think of <HI>them.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>That indeed, my Dear, is the nece&s;&s;ary Character of a publick Speaker, be he Lawyer, or what he will: The Man who cannot doubt him&s;elf, and can judge contemptibly of his Auditors, never fails to &s;peak with <HI>Self-applau&s;e</HI> at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>But you'll pardon me, good Sir, for &s;peaking my Mind &s;o freely, and &s;o early, of the&s;e <HI>your Friends.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">I never, my Love, ask you a Que&s;tion, I wi&s;h you not to an&s;wer; and always expect your An&s;wer &s;hould be without Re&s;erve; for many times I may ask your Opinion, as a Corrective or a Confirmation of my own Judgment.</P>
<P>How kind, how indulgent was this, my good Lady?&mdash;But you know, how generou&s;ly your dear Brother treats me, on all Occa&s;ions; and this makes me &s;o bold as I often am.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary, my dear Lady, to give you an Account of our Vi&s;itors, in order to make the future Parts of my Writing the more intelligible; becau&s;e what I may have to write, may turn &s;ome|times upon the Company we &s;ee: For which Rea&s;on, I &s;hall al&s;o ju&s;t mention Sir <HI>George Stuart,</HI> a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Gentleman, with whom Mr. <HI>B.</HI> came acquainted in his Travels, who &s;eems to be a polite, and (Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, is) a learned Man, and a Virtuo&s;o: He, and a Nephew of his of the &s;ame Name, a ba&s;hful Gen|tleman, and who, for that Rea&s;on, I imagine, has a Merit that lies deeper than a fir&s;t Ob&s;ervation can reach, are ju&s;t gone from us, and were received with &s;o much Civility by Mr. <HI>B.</HI> as intitles them to my re&s;pectful Regard.</P>
<P>Thus, Madam, do I run on, in a manner, with|out Materials; and only to &s;hew you the Plea&s;ure I take in obeying you. I hope my good Lord <HI>Davers</HI> continues in Health, and me in his Favour; which I value extremely, as well as your Lady&s;hip's. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> I hope, likewi&s;e enjoys his Health.

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Write to you both, at this time, for your Ad|vice in a particular Ca&s;e, that is the only one, that I have had, or I hope ever &s;hall have, with my dear Benefactor, by way of Di&s;pute; and as he is plea&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t upon his way, and it is a Point of Con&s;cience with me, I mu&s;t re&s;olve, I think, to be determin'd by your joint Advice; and if my Father and Mother, and Husband, are of one Opinion, I mu&s;t yield up my own:</P>
<P>This is the Subject: I think a Mother ought, if &s;he can, to be the Nur&s;e to her own Children.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, he will not permit it.</P>
<P>It is the fir&s;t <HI>will not</HI> I have heard from him; or given Occa&s;ion for: And I tell him, that as it is a Point of Con&s;cience with me, I hope he will indulge me: But the dear Gentleman has an odd way of arguing, that &s;ometimes puzzles me. He pretends to an&s;wer me from Scripture; but I have &s;ome Doubts of <HI>his</HI> Expo&s;ition; and he gives me Leave to write to you, tho' yet he won't promi&s;e to be determin'd by your Opinions, if they are not the &s;ame with his own; and I &s;ay to him, Is this fair, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI>? Is it?&mdash;</P>
<P>He has got the Dean's Opinion with him; for our Debate began before we came to Town: But then he would not let me &s;tate the Ca&s;e; but did it him&s;elf; and yet 'tis but an half Opinion, as I may &s;ay, neither. For it is, That if the Husband is &s;et upon it, it is a Wife's Duty to obey.</P>
<P>But I can't &s;ee how that is; for if it be the <HI>natu|ral</HI> Duty of a Mother, it is a <HI>Divine</HI> Duty; and
<PB N="34" REF="35">
how can a Husband have Power to di&s;charge a Di|vine Duty?&mdash;As great as a Wife's Obligation is to obey her Husband, which is, I own, one Indi&s;|pen&s;able of the Marriage Contract, it ought not to interfere with what one takes to be a &s;uperior Duty: And mu&s;t not one be one's own Judge of Actions, by which we mu&s;t &s;tand or fall?&mdash;</P>
<P>I'll tell you my Plea:</P>
<P>I &s;ay, That where a Mother is unhealthy; &s;ubject to communicative Di&s;tempers, as &s;crophulous, or &s;corbutick, or con&s;umptive Di&s;orders, which have infected the Blood or Lungs; or where they have not Plenty of Nouri&s;hment for the Child, as, I have heard, is the Ca&s;e of &s;ome; that in the&s;e Ca&s;es, a Di&s;pen&s;ation lies of cour&s;e.</P>
<Q><P>But where there is good Health, free Spirits, and plentiful Nouri&s;hment; I think it an indi&s;pen&s;a|ble Duty.</P>
<P>For this was the Cu&s;tom, of old, of all the good Wives we read of in Scripture.</P>
<P>Then the Nouri&s;hment of the Mother mu&s;t be mo&s;t natural to the Child.</P>
<P>Then a Nur&s;e may have a bad Husband, may have Di&s;tempers, may have private Vices, as to Liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be carele&s;s, and a Self-lover; while a Mother prefers the Health of her Child to her own private Satisfactions, or Appetites.</P>
<P>A Nur&s;e may be of a &s;ordid Nature; and when I have heard Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;o &s;atirical on Lords and Gentlemen in Coach-boxes, why may not Cha|rity make one think, that the Lady of the Fa|mily was innocent of &s;ordid and unpardonable Crimes, imputed by &s;evere Judges; and that the Child, when grown up, owes its Ta&s;te to the Coach-box, to its Nur&s;e's being the Coachman's Wife, or the Wife of one of like
<PB N="35" REF="36">
Degree, who may not have a Mind or Quali|ties above that Degree; for, as the Blood and Spirits are augmented, with the Child's Growth, by the Food it takes in, a &s;ordid Nature may as well be communicated from a &s;ound Woman, as bad Health by an un&s;ound, as I &s;hould ima|gine.</P>
<P>Then the Child, by the De&s;ignation of Nature, generally brings its Nouri&s;hment into the World with it: And Art mu&s;t be u&s;ed, as I pre&s;ume, to dry up the Fountains of &s;uch its Nouri&s;hment: And is not this quite unnatural?</P>
<P>And is not what is unnatural, &s;inful?</P>
<P>Then I have lately read, my Circum&s;tances having made me curious on this Subject; that a new-born Child has, in its little Bowels, a pitchy Sub|&s;tance, that wants to be purged off; and when it is not, occa&s;ions tho&s;e Gripings and Convul|&s;ions which de&s;troy &s;o many mi&s;erable Infants, even (as one finds by the weekly Bills here in Town) more than half of tho&s;e who die in In|fancy: Whereas Nature has de&s;ign'd, it &s;eems, a Cure for this, in the purgative Quality, and fine thin Bluene&s;s given to the fir&s;t Milk, which in three Weeks or a Month, or may be le&s;s, carries off that pitchy Sub&s;tance, and gives Freedom and Ea&s;e to the Bowels of Babies; a Quality which, not being in &s;taler Milk, the poor Child often falls a Sacrifice to this Negli|gence or Inattention; and the Mother's Pains, and Hazards, are all ca&s;t away; and her Griefs, at lo&s;ing the dear Infant, are much greater than her Joys, at its Birth, when all the Danger was over.</P>
<P>Then, dear Sir, &s;aid I, there is another Point, re&s;pecting the Health of our Sex.&mdash;Great Hurts to one's Con&s;titution may ari&s;e from too fre|quently
<PB N="36" REF="37">
being in this Circum&s;tance; and, for my own Part, you have made me &s;o happy, that I cannot help being <HI>covetous</HI> of Life, if I may &s;o &s;ay.&mdash;But the Sin, dear Sir, the Sin of committing that Task to others, which is &s;o right to be performed by one's &s;elf, if one has Health and Strength to perform it, is the chief thing with me; and, you know, Sir, that even a Husband's Will is not &s;ufficient to excu&s;e one from a natural or divine Obligation.</P></Q>
<P>The&s;e were my Pleas, among others: And this is his An&s;wer; for he was &s;o good to give it me in writing:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As to what you allege, my Dear, of old Cu|&s;toms; Times and Fa&s;hions are much changed.

<P>Upon Condition, therefore, that he requires not to &s;ee this my Letter, nor your An&s;wer to it, unle&s;s I plea&s;e, I write for your Advice; for you both have always made a Con&s;cience of your Duties, and taught me to do &s;o too, or perhaps I had not been what I am; and I know, morever, that nobody is more conver&s;ant with the Scriptures than you are; and, &s;ome how or other, he has got the Dean again&s;t me; and I care not to be &s;o free with the worthy Mini|&s;ter of our Pari&s;h here, and &s;till le&s;s with the younger Clergymen I am acquainted with.</P>
<P>But this I &s;ee plainly enough, that he will have his own Way; and if I cannot get over my Scruples, what &s;hall I do?

Then weak Minds will have their Doubts, and the Law allows a Toleration for &s;crupulous and tender Con&s;ciences: But my beloved Husband, my Lawgiver, and my Prince, I doubt, will allow none to poor me!</P>
<P>As to the Liberty he gives me for a Month, I &s;hould be loth to take it; for one does not know the Inconveniences that may attend a Change of Nouri&s;hment; or if I did, I &s;hould rather&mdash;But I know not what I would &s;ay; for I am but a young Creature to be in this Way, and very unequal to it in every re&s;pect!

<P>I Thank you, my deare&s;t Parents, for your kind Letter; it was given to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and he brought it to me him&s;elf, and was angry at me: Indeed he was; as you &s;hall hear:</P>
<P>'Tis from the good Couple, my Dear, I &s;ee. I hope they are of my Opinion. But whether they be or not&mdash;But I will leave you; and do you, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;tep down to my Clo&s;et when you have, perus'd it.</P>

<P>I will, Sir&mdash;I will&mdash;as &s;oon as I can&mdash;for this being my fir&s;t Check, &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly given, my Heart was full. But as I knew he would be angry, and think me ob&s;tinate, if I did not &s;peak; I &s;aid, full
<PB N="49" REF="50">
of Concern&mdash;I wi&s;h, Sir&mdash;I wi&s;h&mdash;you had been plea&s;ed to &s;pare me longer, a little longer, for the &s;ame kind, very kind Con&s;ideration!&mdash;</P>
<P>But is it not better, my Dear, to tell you I <HI>was</HI> a little out of Humour, than that I <HI>am?</HI>&mdash;But you had been very earne&s;t with me on this Point more than once; and you put me upon a hated, becau&s;e an ungenerous, Nece&s;&s;ity of pleading my Preroga|tive, as I call it: And yet this would not do, but you would appeal again&s;t me in the Point I was deter|min'd upon, for Rea&s;ons altogether generous, and in your Favour; and if this was not like my <HI>Pamela,</HI> excu&s;e me, my deare&s;t Love, that I could not help being a little unlike my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ah! thought I, this is not &s;o very unlike your dear Self, if I were to give the lea&s;t Shadow of an Occa|&s;ion; for it is of a Piece with your Le&s;&s;ons for|merly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 311, 312, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, &s;aid I, I was not in the lea&s;t aware, that I had offended!&mdash;But I was too little circum|&s;pect. I had been u&s;ed to your Goodne&s;s for &s;o long a Time, that I expected it, it &s;eems; and thought I was &s;ure of your favourable Con&s;truction.</P>
<P>Why &s;o you may be, my Dear, in every thing <HI>almo&s;t.</HI> But I don't love to &s;peak <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>p.</HI> 317.</NOTE> twice my Mind on the &s;ame Subject; you know I don't; and you have really di&s;puted this Point with me Five or Six times: In&s;omuch, that I wonder'd what was come to my Deare&s;t!&mdash;</P>
<P>I thought, Sir, you would have di&s;tingui&s;h'd between a Command where my Con&s;cience was concerned, and a common Point: You know, Sir, I never had any Will but yours in common Points. &mdash;But indeed you make me fearful, becau&s;e my
<PB N="50" REF="51">
Task is render'd too difficult for my own weak Judgment. But then, Sir&mdash;But I &s;hall offend again&mdash;</P>
<P>And then what? Say all you would &s;ay, <HI>Pamela.</HI> &mdash;And then what?</P>
<P>Why, Sir, if I mu&s;t &s;peak&mdash;You threaten me &s;o at every Turn with that cruel Word <HI>Polygamy,</HI> that it &s;hews me, it is too much in your Mind&mdash; But I &s;hall make you angry again.</P>
<P>Was not the Patriarch Husbands Practice, <HI>Pamela,</HI> a fit Thing to be oppos'd to that of the Patriarch Wives? But do you &s;ay, I <HI>threaten</HI> you with that Word? Take care, my Love: You have been a <HI>faultle&s;s Angel</HI> hitherto. Don't let me find you ready to make &s;uch har&s;h Con&s;tructions as a <HI>mere Woman</HI> is accu&s;tom'd to make, when &s;he is di&s;|pos'd to be captious; altho' a better Con&s;truction lies before her.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent, but by my Tears.</P>
<P>Now I doubt, <HI>Pamela,</HI> your Spirit is high. You won't &s;peak, becau&s;e you are out of Humour at what I &s;ay. I will have no &s;ullen Re&s;erves, my Deare&s;t. What means that heaving Sob? I know, my dear Love, that this is a Time with your Sex, when, &s;adden'd with your Apprehen&s;ions, and indulged becau&s;e of them, by the fond Husband, it is need|ful, for both their &s;akes, to watch over the Changes of their Temper. For Ladies in your Way, are often like incroaching Subjects: They are apt to extend what they call their Privileges, on the Indul|gence &s;hewed them; and the Husband never again recovers the A&s;cendant he had before.</P>
<P>You know the&s;e Things better than I, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> But I had no Intention to invade your Province, or go out of my own. Yet I thought I had a Right to a little Free-will, a very little; e&s;pecially on &s;ome greater Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">Why &s;o you have, my Dear. But you mu&s;t not plead one Text of Scripture in Behalf of your own Will; and refu&s;e to another its due Weight, when it makes for mine.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I have one Advan|tage above others of my Sex: For if Wives in my Circum&s;tance are apt to grow upon Indulgence, I am very happy, that your kind and watchful Care will hinder me from falling into that Danger.</P>
<P>He gave me a kind Tap on the Neck: Let me beat my beloved Sawcebox, &s;aid he: Is it thus you railly my watchful Care over you for your own Good? But tell me truly, <HI>Pamela,</HI> are you not a little &s;ullen? Look up to me, my Dear&mdash;Are you not?</P>
<P>I believe I am; but 'tis but a very little, Sir&mdash;It will &s;oon go off&mdash;Plea&s;e to let me withdraw, that I may take my&s;elf to Task about it;&mdash;for at pre&s;ent, I know not what to do, becau&s;e I did not expect the Di&s;plea&s;ure I have incurr'd.</P>
<P>Is it not the &s;ame Thing, reply'd he, if this our fir&s;t Quarrel end here, without your withdrawing? &mdash;I forgive you heartily, my <HI>Pamela</HI>; and give me one Ki&s;s, and I will think of your &s;aucy Appeal again&s;t me no more.</P>
<P>I will comply with your Conditions, dear Sir; but I have a great Mind to be &s;aucy. I wi&s;h you would let me for this once.</P>
<P>What would you &s;ay, my Deare&s;t? Be &s;aucy then, as you call it, as &s;aucy as you can.</P>
<P>Why then, Sir, I am a little &s;ullen at pre&s;ent, that I am:&mdash;And I am not fully convinc'd, whe|ther it mu&s;t be I that forgive you, or you me.&mdash; For indeed, till I can recollect, I cannot think my Fault &s;o great in this Point, that was a Point of Con&s;cience to me, as (pardon me) Sir, to &s;tand in need of your Forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">Well then, my Deare&s;t, &s;aid he, cla&s;ping his kind Arms about me, we will forgive another: but take this with you, That it is my Love to you, that makes me more delicate than otherwi&s;e I &s;hould be; and you have inur'd me &s;o much to a faultle&s;s Conduct, that I can hardly bear with natural Infirmi|ties from you.&mdash;But, giving me another Tap, Get you gone; I leave you to your Recollection; and let me know what Fruits it produces; for I mu&s;t not be put off with a Half-compliance; I mu&s;t have your whole <HI>Will</HI> with me, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>So I went up, and recollecting every thing, <HI>&s;acri|fic'd to my Sex,</HI> as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> calls it, when he talks of a Wife's Reluctance to give up a favourite Point; for I &s;hed a good many Tears, becau&s;e my Heart was &s;et upon it; and this Patriarchal Retort hung heavy upon my Mind.</P>
<P>And &s;o, my dear Father and Mother, Twenty charming Ideas and Plea&s;ures, which I had formed to my&s;elf, had I obtained this Permi&s;&s;ion, are vani&s;hed from me, and my Mea&s;ures are quite broken. But after my Heart was relieved by my Eye, I was lighter and ea&s;ier. And the Re&s;ult is, we have heard of a good &s;ort of Body, that is to be my poor <HI>Baby's Mother,</HI> when it comes; and &s;o your kindly-offer'd Inquiries are needle&s;s, I believe.</P>
<P>I can't tell but this &s;ort of Rebuff might be a little nece&s;&s;ary, after all; for I had forgotten, thro' Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s pa&s;t Indulgence for &s;o long a Time, his Injun|ctions and Le&s;&s;ons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 311, &amp;c. <HI>before cited.</HI></NOTE>; and this awfully-inforced Re|membrance &s;hews me, that the Rules he formerly pre&s;cribed, were not Words of Cour&s;e, but that he intended to keep me up to the Letter of them.&mdash; So I mu&s;t be a little more circum&s;pect, I find that, then of late I thought I had Occa&s;ion to be.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="54">But he is the be&s;t and tendere&s;t of Husbands, for all this; and yet I was forced to accept of <HI>his</HI> For|givene&s;s, and he did not think him&s;elf obliged to me for <HI>mine</HI>; and has carry'd his Point all to nothing, as the Racing Gentlemen &s;ay. But I can &s;ee one Thing, neverthele&s;s, on this Occa&s;ion, that the Words <HI>Command</HI> and <HI>Obey</HI> are not quite blotted out of his Vocabulary, as he &s;aid they &s;hould be <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 317.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, truly, I did not imagine before, that the Husband had &s;o very exten&s;ive a Prerogative neither. &mdash;Nor do I believe, that many Ladies would &s;it down &s;o &s;atisfy'd with it, as I am forced to do.&mdash; Yet he vows, that it mu&s;t have been &s;o, had he marry'd a <HI>Prince&s;s</HI>;&mdash;and that it is not becau&s;e of the former Inequality of Condition between us.</P>
<P>I can't tell what to &s;ay to that: But I fan&s;y there would then have been &s;ome <HI>princely</HI> Struggles between them, had it been &s;o.&mdash;It may be, if he could not have conquer'd, he would not have liv'd with her; or, perhaps, would have run into his wicked Poly|gamy Notions.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to my further great <HI>Comfort,</HI> has ju&s;t been telling me, how little a Wife of his mu&s;t expect from her Tears; and his mo&s;t nicely been di&s;tin|gui&s;hing between Tears of <HI>Sullenne&s;s,</HI> and Tears of <HI>Penitence:</HI> The one, he declares, &s;hall always meet with his Indulgence and Kindne&s;s, and never pa&s;s unrewarded: But the other, being the la&s;t Re&s;ources of the Sex, after they are di&s;armed of all others, and by which they too often, as he &s;ays, carry all their Purpo&s;es, he will never &s;uffer to have any Force at all upon him.</P>
<P>Very heroick, truly!&mdash;One &s;tands a poor Chance in a Conte&s;t with &s;uch an Husband.&mdash;It mu&s;t be all pure unmixed Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion! And
<PB N="54" REF="55">
I find half the Tears a poor Wife might &s;hed in matrimonial Bickerings, (&s;o frequent with &s;ome, even of tho&s;e not unhappily married, as the World goes) would be of no Effect, were all Men of his Mind.</P>
<P>'Tis well for our Sex in general, that there are not many Gentlemen who di&s;tingui&s;h thus nicely. For, I doubt, there are but very few &s;o well intitled to their Ladies Ob&s;ervances as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is; and who would act &s;o generou&s;ly and &s;o tenderly by a Wife as he does, in every material In&s;tance on which the Happine&s;s of Life depends.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. From Lady <HI>Davers</HI> to Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> Pamela,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;ent you a Pre&s;ent, the complete&s;t I could procure, of every thing that may &s;uit your approaching happy Circum&s;tance; as I hope it will be to you, and to us all. But it is with a Hope annex'd, That altho' both Sexes are thought of in it, yet that you will not put us off with a Girl: No, Child, we will not permit, may we have our Wills, that you &s;hall <HI>think</HI> of giving us a Girl, till you have pre&s;ented us with half a dozen fine Boys. For our Line is gone &s;o low, that we expect that human Security from you in your fir&s;t Seven Years, or we &s;hall be di&s;appointed, I can tell you that.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">And now, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I will give you their Names, if my Brother and you approve of them: Your Fir&s;t &s;hall be BILLY; my Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> and the Earl of C&mdash;, &s;hall be Godfathers; and it mu&s;t be doubly God-mother'd too, or I am afraid the Coun|te&s;s and I &s;hall fall out about it. Your Second, &s;hall be DAVERS; be&s;ure remember that&mdash;Your Third, &s;hall be CHARLEY; your Fourth, JEMMY; your Fifth, HARRY; your Sixth&mdash;DUDLEY, if you will&mdash;and your Girl, if you had not rather call it PAMELA, &s;hall be BARBARA&mdash;The re&s;t you mu&s;t name as you plea&s;e.&mdash;And &s;o, my Dear, I wi&s;h all Seven happily over with you.</P>
<P>I am glad you got &s;afe to Town; and long to hear of Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s Arrival, becau&s;e I know you'll be out of your Bia&s;s in your new Settlement till then. She is a fine Lady; and writes the mo&s;t to my Ta&s;te of any one of her Sex, that I know, next to you. I wi&s;h &s;he'd be &s;o kind to corre&s;pond with me. But be&s;ure don't omit to give me the Sequel of her Si&s;ter and <HI>Murray</HI>'s Affair, and what you think will plea&s;e me in relation to her. You do well to &s;ave your&s;elf the Trouble of de&s;cribing the Town and the publick Places. We are no Strangers to them; and they are too much our Table-talk, when any Country Lady has, for the fir&s;t time, been carried to Town, and return'd: Be&s;ides, what <HI>London</HI> affords, is nothing that de&s;erves Mention, compar'd to what we have &s;een at <HI>Paris,</HI> and at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and other of the <HI>French</HI> Palaces. You exactly, therefore, hit our Ta&s;tes, and an&s;wer our Expectations, when you give us, in your pecu|liar manner, Sentiments on what we may call the <HI>Soul of Things,</HI> and &s;uch Characters as you draw with a Pencil borrow'd from the Hand of Nature, inter|mingled with tho&s;e fine Lights and Shades, of Re|flections
<PB N="56" REF="57">
and Ob&s;ervations, that make your Pictures glow, and in&s;truct as well as inform.</P>
<P>There, <HI>Pamela,</HI> is Incouragement for you to proceed in obliging us. We are all of one Mind in this re&s;pect; and more than ever, &s;ince we have &s;een your Actions &s;o well an&s;wer to your Writings; and that Theory and Practice, with regard to every Excellence that can adorn a Lady, is the &s;ame thing with you.</P>
<P>We are pleas'd with your Lawyers Characters. There are Life and Nature in them; but never avoid giving all the Characters that occur to you; for that &s;eems to be one of your Talents; and in the uglie&s;t you can draw, there will be Matter of In&s;truction; e&s;pecially as you &s;eem naturally to fall upon &s;uch as are &s;o general, that no one who conver&s;es, but mu&s;t &s;ee in them the Picture of one or other he is acquainted with.</P>
<P>By this Time, perhaps, Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> will be with you&mdash;Our Re&s;pects to her, if &s;o.&mdash;And you will have been at &s;ome of the Theatrical Entertain|ments. So will not want Subjects to oblige us.&mdash; 'Twas a good Thought of your dear Man's, to carry you to &s;ee the &s;everal Hou&s;es, and to make you a Judge, by that Means, of the Di&s;po&s;ition and Fa&s;hion of every thing in them. Tell him, I love him bet|ter and better. I am proud of my Brother, and do nothing but talk of what a charming Husband he makes. But then, he gives an Example to all who know him, and his uncontrouled Temper, (which makes again&s;t many of us) that it is po&s;&s;ible for a good Wife to make even a bad Man a worthy Husband: And this affords an In&s;truction, which may &s;tand all our Sex in good &s;tead.&mdash;But then they mu&s;t have been cautious fir&s;t, that they have cho&s;en a Man of natural good Sen&s;e, and good Manners, and not a brutal or abandon'd Debauchee.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">But hark-ye-me, my &s;weet Girl, what have I done to you, that you won't write your&s;elf <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> to me? I could find in my Heart to be angry with you on this Account. Before my la&s;t Vi&s;it, indeed, I was &s;crupulous to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf &s;o to <HI>you.</HI> But &s;ince I have &s;een my&s;elf &s;o much &s;urpa&s;s'd in all manner of Excellence, that I would take Plea&s;ure in the Name, you a&s;&s;ume a Pride in your Turn, and think it an undervaluing of your&s;elf, I &s;uppo&s;e, to call <HI>me</HI> &s;o.&mdash;Ay, that's the Thing, I doubt&mdash;Altho', I can tell you, I have endeavour'd, by &s;everal Regulations &s;ince my Return, (and the Counte&s;s, too, keeps your Example in di&s;tant View, as well as I) to be more worthy of the Appellation. If, therefore, you would avoid the Reproaches of &s;ecret Pride, under the Shadow of &s;o remarkable an Humility, for the future never omit &s;ub&s;cribing, as I do, with great Plea&s;ure,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. In An&s;wer to the preceding.</HEAD>
<P>HOW you overwhelm me with your Goodne&s;s, my deare&s;t Lady, in every Word of your la&s;t welcome Letter, is beyond my Power to expre&s;s! How nobly has your Lady contrived, in your ever-valu'd
<PB N="58" REF="59">
Pre&s;ent, to encourage a doubting and appre|hen&s;ive Mind! And how does it contribute to my Joy and my Glory, that I am deemed by the noble Si&s;ter of my be&s;t Beloved, not wholly unworthy of being the humble Means to continue, and, perhaps, to perpetuate, a Family &s;o antient and &s;o honoura|ble!&mdash;</P>
<P>This, Madam, when I contemplate, and look upon what I was&mdash;What can I &s;ay!&mdash;How &s;hall I expre&s;s the Sen&s;e of the Honour, done me!&mdash;And when, skipping over for a few Moments, the other enga|ging Particulars in your Lady&s;hip's Letter, I come to the la&s;t charming Paragraph, I am doubly affected to &s;ee my&s;elf &s;eemingly upbraided, but &s;o politely imbolden'd to a&s;&s;ume an Appellation, that otherwi&s;e I hardly dar'd to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>I&mdash;<HI>humble I</HI>&mdash;who never had a Si&s;ter before! &mdash;To find one now in <HI>Lady</HI> DAVERS! O Madam, you, and <HI>only</HI> you, can teach me Words fit to expre&s;s the Joy and the Gratitude that fill my delighted Heart!&mdash;But thus much I am taught, and thus much I can &s;ay, tho' at a Lo&s;s for other Words, that there is &s;omething more than the Low-born can imagine in Birth and Education. This is &s;o evi|dent in your Lady's Actions, Words, and Manner, that it &s;trikes one with a becoming Reverence; and we look up with Awe to a Condition we emulate in vain, when rai&s;ed by partial Favour, like what I have found; and are confounded, when we &s;ee Gran|deur of Soul join'd with Grandeur of Birth and Condition; and a noble Lady, acting thus nobly, as Lady <HI>Davers</HI> acts.</P>
<P>My be&s;t Wi&s;hes, and a thou&s;and Ble&s;&s;ings, attend your Lady&s;hip in all you undertake! And I am per|&s;uaded the latter will, and a Peace and Satisfaction of Mind incomparably to be preferr'd to whatever el&s;e this World can afford, in the new Regulations,
<PB N="59" REF="60">
which you, and my dear Lady Counte&s;s, have &s;et on Foot in your Families: And when I can have the Happine&s;s to know what they are, I &s;hall, I am con|fident, greatly improve my own Methods by them. Were we to live for ever in this Life, we might be carele&s;s and indifferent about the&s;e Matters; but when &s;uch an Uncertainty as to the Time, and &s;uch a Certainty as to the Event, is before us, a prudent Mind will be always preparing, till prepared; and what can be a better Preparative, than charitable Actions to our Fellow-creatures in the Eye of that Maje&s;ty, which wants nothing of us him&s;elf, but to do ju&s;t and merciful Things to one another? Par|don me, my deare&s;t Lady, for this my free Style. Methinks I am out of my&s;elf; I know not how to de&s;cend all at once from the Height to which you have rai&s;ed me: And you mu&s;t forgive the Refle|ctions to which you your&s;elf, and your own noble Actions, have given Birth!</P>
<P>Here, having taken Re&s;pite a little, I find I natu|rally enough &s;ink into <HI>Body</HI> again.&mdash;And will not your Lady&s;hip confine your Expectations from me within narrower Limits?&mdash;I hope you will.&mdash;For, Oh! my excellent Lady, I cannot, even with my Wi&s;hes, &s;o &s;wiftly follow your Expectations, if &s;uch they are! But, however, leaving Futurity to HIM, who only can govern Futurity, and who conducts us all, and our Affairs, as &s;hall be&s;t an&s;wer his own Divine Purpo&s;es, I will proceed, as well as I can, to obey your Lady&s;hip in tho&s;e Articles, which are, at pre|&s;ent, more within my own Power.</P>
<P>My dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> then, let me acquaint your Lady&s;hip, arrived here on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> la&s;t: She had given us Notice, by a Line, of the Day &s;he &s;et out; and Sir <HI>Simon</HI> and Lady <HI>Darnford</HI> &s;aw her Ten Miles on the Way to the Stage-coach in Sir
<PB N="60" REF="61">
<HI>Simon</HI>'s Coach, Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> attending her on Hor&s;e|back; they parted with her, as was ea&s;y to gue&s;s from her Merit, with great Tenderne&s;s; and we are to look upon the Vi&s;it, (as we do) as a high Favour from her Papa and Mamma; who, however, charge her not to exceed a Month in and out, which I regret much. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> kindly propo&s;ed to me, as Mi&s;s came in the Stage-coach, attended with one Maid-&s;ervant, to meet her Part of the Way in his Coach and Six, if, as he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, it would not be too fatiguing to me; and we would go &s;o early, as to dine at <HI>St. Albans.</HI> I gladly con|&s;ented, and we got thither about One o'Clock, attended by Mr. <HI>Colbrand, Abraham</HI> and <HI>John</HI>; and while Dinner was preparing, he was plea&s;ed to &s;hew me the great Church there, and the curious Vault of the Good Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and al&s;o the Monu|ment of the Great Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon</HI> in St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s Church; all which, no doubt, your Lady&s;hip has &s;een.</P>
<P>There happen'd to be Six Pa&s;&s;engers in the Stage-coach, and Mi&s;s was exceedingly glad to be relieved from them, tho' the Weather was cold enough, Two of the Pa&s;&s;engers being not very agreeable Com|pany, one a rough military Man, the other a po&s;i|tive humour&s;ome old Gentlewoman; and the other Two, not &s;uch as &s;he had Rea&s;on to regret parting with; Two Si&s;ters, who jangled now-and-then, &s;aid Mi&s;s, as much as <HI>my</HI> Si&s;ter, and my Si&s;ter's <HI>Si&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip will judge how joyful this Meet|ing was to Mi&s;s and to me. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was no le&s;s delighted, and &s;aid, He was infinitely obliged to Sir <HI>Simon</HI> for this precious Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s &s;aid, I came with double Plea&s;ure to &s;ee the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity in <HI>England,</HI> an Husband and a Wife, who have not, in &s;o many Months, that you

<P>There might, &s;aid &s;he, if there were more &s;uch Husbands as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> makes.&mdash;Oh! you are a charming Man!&mdash;I hated you once, and I thought you very wicked; but I revere you now.</P>
<P>If you will <HI>revere</HI> any body, my dear Mi&s;s, &s;aid he, let it be this good Girl; for it is all owing to her Conduct and Di&s;cretion, that I make a tolera|ble Husband: Were there more &s;uch Wives, I am per&s;uaded, there would be more &s;uch Husbands, than there are.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear Mi&s;s, &s;aid I, what it is to be wedded to a generous Mind! Mr. <HI>B.</HI> by his noble Treatment of me, creates a Merit in me, and di&s;claims the natural Effects of his own Good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, you're a charming Couple&mdash;Per&s;on and Mind, I know not any Equal either of you have. &mdash; But, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I will not compliment you too highly. I may make <HI>you</HI> proud, for Men are &s;aucy Creatures; but I cannot make your <HI>Lady</HI> &s;o: And in this Doubt of the one, and Confidence in the other, I mu&s;t join with you, that <HI>her</HI> Merit is the greate&s;t&mdash;Since, excu&s;e me, bold Gentleman, as I know you have been! her Example has reformed her Rake; and you have only confirm'd in her the Virtues you found ready formed to your Hand.</P>
<P>That Di&s;tinction, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is worthy of Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s Judgment.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t Mi&s;s, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid I, take|ing each by the Hand, how can you go on thus! &mdash;As I look upon every kind thing, Two &s;uch dear Friends &s;ay to me, as Incentives for me, to endea|vour to de&s;erve them, you mu&s;t not task me too
<PB N="62" REF="63">
high; for then, in&s;tead of encouraging, you'll give me De&s;pair.</P>
<P>The dear Gentleman cla&s;ped us both in his Arms, and &s;aluted each&mdash;And called us his Two Non-pareils.</P>
<P>He led us into the Coach, placing Mi&s;s and me on the Front-&s;eat, and him&s;elf on the other, with Mi&s;s's Maid-&s;ervant, a genteel, prudent young Body, whom her Lady would fain have left in the Stage, to avoid the Honour of &s;itting with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> And in a free, ea&s;y, joyful Manner, not in the lea&s;t tir'd or fatigu'd, did we reach the Town and Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Hou&s;e; with which, and its Furniture, and the Apartments allotted for her, Mi&s;s is highly plea|&s;ed.</P>
<P>But the dear Lady put me into &s;ome little Con|fu&s;ion, when &s;he &s;aw me fir&s;t, taking Notice of my Improvements, as &s;he called them, before Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I look'd at him, and look'd at her&mdash;Dear Mi&s;s! &s;aid I, with a blu&s;hing Cheek and down-ca&s;t Eye. He &s;miled at Mi&s;s, and &s;aid, Would <HI>you,</HI> my good Mi&s;s, look &s;o &s;illy, after &s;uch a Length of Time, with an Husband you had no Occa&s;ion to be a&s;ham'd of?&mdash;No, indeed, Sir, not I, I'll a&s;&s;ure you; nor will I forgive tho&s;e Maiden Airs in a Wife &s;o happy as you are. I &s;aid nothing. But I wi&s;h'd my&s;elf, in Mind and Behaviour, to be ju&s;t what Mi&s;s <HI>Darn|ford</HI> is.</P>
<P>But, my dear Lady, Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> has had tho&s;e early Advantages from Conver&s;ation, which I had not; and &s;o I mu&s;t never expect to know how to deport my&s;elf with that mode&s;t Freedom and Ea&s;e, which, altho' &s;ome of my Favourers attribute to me, yet I know I want, and &s;hall always want. For, I am every Day more and more &s;en&s;ible of the great Difference there is in being us'd to the polite&s;t. Conver&s;ation as an Inferior, and in being born to
<PB N="63" REF="64">
bear a Part in it: In the one, all is &s;et, &s;tiff, auk|ward, and the Per&s;on ju&s;t &s;uch an Ape of Imitation as poor I. In the other, all is natural Ea&s;e and Sweetne&s;s&mdash;like Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Knowing this, I don't indeed aim at what I am &s;en&s;ible I cannot attain; and &s;o, I hope, am le&s;s expo&s;ed to Ridicule, than I &s;hould be, if I did. For, I have heard Mr. <HI>B.</HI> ob&s;erve with regard to Gentle|men who build fine Hou&s;es, and make fine Gardens, and open fine Pro&s;pects, that Art &s;hould never take place of, but be &s;ub&s;ervient to Nature; and a Gentleman, if he is confin'd to a Situation, had bet|ter conform his De&s;igns to that, than to do as at <HI>Chat&s;worth</HI> was done, that is to &s;ay, level a Mountain at a mon&s;trous Expence; which, had it been &s;uf|fered to remain, in &s;o wild and romantick a Scene as <HI>Chat&s;worth</HI> affords, might have been made one of the greate&s;t Beauties of the Place.</P>
<P>So I, Madam, think I had better endeavour to make the be&s;t of tho&s;e natural Defects I cannot ma&s;ter, than by a&s;&s;uming Airs and Dignities in Appearance, to which I was not born, act neither Part tolerably. By this means, in&s;tead of being thought neither Gentlewoman nor Ru&s;tick, as Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> hinted, (<HI>Lin&s;ey-wol&s;ey,</HI> I think, was his Term too) I may be look'd upon as an Original in my Way; and all Originals pa&s;s Mu&s;ter well enough, you know, Madam, even with Judges.</P>
<P>Now I am upon this Subject, I can form to my&s;elf, if your Lady&s;hip will excu&s;e me, two &s;uch polite Gentlemen, as my Lawyers, mention'd in my former, who, with a true <HI>London</HI> Magna|nimity and Penetration,&mdash;(For, Madam, I fan&s;y your <HI>London</HI> Criticks will be the &s;evere&s;t upon the Country Girl) will put on mighty &s;igni|ficant Looks, forgetting, may-be, they have any Faults them&s;elves, and apprehending they have
<PB N="64" REF="65">
nothing to do, but to &s;it in Judgment upon others, expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves after this manner:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why, truly, <HI>Jack,</HI> the Girl is well enough!&mdash;<HI>con&s;idering</HI> &mdash;I can't &s;ay"</Q>
&mdash; (then a Pinch of Snuff, per|haps, adds Importance to their Air)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but a Man might love her for a Month or two."</Q>
(The&s;e Sparks talk'd in this manner of other Ladies before me) &mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"She behaves better than I expected from her&mdash; <HI>con&s;idering</HI>"</Q>
&mdash;again will follow &mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So I think, cries the other; and to&s;&s;es his Tye behind him with an Air partly of Contempt, and partly of Rakery. &mdash;As you &s;ay, <HI>Jemmy,</HI> I expected to find an aukward Country Girl; but &s;he tops her Part, I'll a&s;&s;ure ye!&mdash;Nay, for that matter, behaves very tolerably for <HI>what &s;he was</HI>&mdash;And is right, not to &s;eem de&s;irous to drown the Remembrance of her Original in her Elevation&mdash;And, I can't but &s;ay"</Q>
&mdash;(for &s;omething like it they did &s;ay)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is mighty pretty, and pa&s;&s;ably genteel."</Q>
And thus, with their poor Prai&s;e of Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Girl, they think they have made a fine Compliment to his Judg|ment.</P>
<P>But for <HI>his</HI> &s;ake&mdash;for as to my own, I am not &s;olicitous about <HI>&s;uch</HI> Gentlemens good Opinions, I owe them a Spite; and believe, I &s;hall find an Oppor|tunity to come out of their Debt. For I have the Vanity to think, now your Lady&s;hip has made me proud by your kind Incouragements and Approba|tion, that the Country Girl will make 'em look about 'em with all their <HI>genteel Contempts,</HI> which they mi&s;cal <HI>Prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But how I run on! Your Lady&s;hip expects me to write as freely, as I u&s;ed to do to my Parents. I have the Merit of obeying you, that I have; but, I doubt, too much to the Exerci&s;e of your Patience. This (like all mine) is a long Letter; and I will only add to it Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s humble Re&s;pects
<PB N="65" REF="66">
and Thanks for your Lady&s;hip's kind Mention of her, which &s;he receives as no &s;mall Honour.</P>
<P>And now, Madam, with a greater Plea&s;ure than I can expre&s;s, will I make u&s;e of the Liberty your Lady&s;hip &s;o kindly allows me to take, of &s;ub&s;cribing my&s;elf, with that profound Re&s;pect which becomes me,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. From Lady <HI>DAVERS</HI> to Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> Pamela,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER I have thanked you for your la&s;t agree|able Letter, which has added the Earl, and Lord <HI>John,</HI> and Lady <HI>Jenny,</HI> to the Number of your Ad|mirers, (you know Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> their Si&s;ter, was &s;o before) I &s;hall tell you, that I now write, at all their Reque&s;ts, as well as at tho&s;e of my Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> the Counte&s;s you &s;o dearly love, and Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> for your Deci&s;ion of an odd Di&s;pute, that, on read|ing your Letter, and talking of your dome&s;tick Ex|cellencies, happen'd among us.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Betty</HI> would have it, That notwith&s;tanding any Aukwardne&s;s which you attribute to your&s;elf, &s;he cannot but decide, by all &s;he has &s;een of you, and has heard us &s;ay, that yours is the perfecte&s;t Character &s;he ever heard or read of.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s &s;aid, That you wrong your&s;elf, in &s;uppo&s;ing, that you are not every thing that is polite
<PB N="66" REF="67">
and genteel, in your Behaviour, as well as Per&s;on; and that &s;he knows not any Lady in <HI>England,</HI> who better becomes her Station than you do.</P>
<P>Why then, &s;aid Lady <HI>Jenny,</HI> Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> mu&s;t be quite perfect; that's certain. So &s;aid her Brother, Lord <HI>John.</HI> So &s;aid the Earl, their Father. So &s;aid they all. And Lord <HI>Davers</HI> confirm'd, that you were. And <HI>Jackey &s;wore</HI> to it.</P>
<P>Yet, as we are &s;ure, there cannot be &s;uch a Cha|racter, in this Life, as has not one Fault, altho' we could not tell where to fix it, the Counte&s;s &s;tarted a whim&s;ical Motion:&mdash;Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, pray do you write to Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> and acquaint her with our Subject; and as it is impo&s;&s;ible, that one who can act as &s;he does, &s;hould not know her&s;elf better than any body el&s;e can do, de&s;ire her to acquaint us with &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;ecret Foibles, that leave room for her to be &s;till more perfect.</P>
<P>A good Thought! &s;aid I: A good Thought! &s;aid they all.&mdash;And this is the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion of my writing; and pray &s;ee, that you accu&s;e your&s;elf of no more than you know your&s;elf guilty: For Over-mode&s;ty borders &s;o nearly on Pride, and too liberal Accu&s;ations &s;eem to be but &s;o many Traps for Acquittal with Applau&s;e, that you (whatever other Ladies might) will not be forgiven, if you deal with us in a way &s;o poorly artful: Let them, there|fore, be &s;uch Faults, as you think we can &s;ub&s;cribe to, from what we have <HI>&s;een</HI> of <HI>you,</HI> and <HI>read</HI> of <HI>yours,</HI> and you mu&s;t try to extenuate them too, as you give them, le&s;t we &s;hould think you above that Nature, which in the mo&s;t and <HI>be&s;t</HI> Ca&s;es is your undoubted Talent.</P>
<P>I congratulate you and Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> on her Ar|rival: She is a charming young Lady; but tell her, that we &s;hall not allow her to take you at your Word, and to think, that &s;he excels you in any one thing:
<PB N="67" REF="68">
Only, indeed, we think you nicer in &s;ome Points, than you need to be, as to your pre&s;ent agreeable Circum&s;tance. And yet, let me tell you, that the ea&s;y and unaffected conjugal Purity, in Word and Behaviour, between your good Man and you, is worthy of Imitation; and what the Counte&s;s and I have with Plea&s;ure contemplated &s;ince we left you, an hundred times, and admire in you both: And 'tis good Policy too, Child, as well as high Deco|rum; for it is what will make you ever new and re&s;pectful to one another.</P>
<P>But <HI>You</HI> have the Honour of it all, who&s;e &s;weet, natural, and ea&s;y Mode&s;ty, in Per&s;on, Behaviour, and Conver&s;ation, forbid Indecency, even in Thought, much more in Word, to approach you; in&s;omuch that no Rakes can be Rakes in your Pre&s;ence, and yet they hardly know to what they owe their Re|&s;traint.</P>
<P>However, as People who &s;ee you, will take it for granted, that you and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> have been very inti|mate together, I &s;hould think you need not be a&s;ham'd of your Appearance, becau&s;e, as he rightly ob&s;erves, you have no Rea&s;on to be a&s;ham'd of your Husband.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e my Plea&s;antry, my Dear: And an&s;wer our Demand upon you, as &s;oon as you can; which will oblige us all; particularly</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT a Task have you impo&s;ed upon me! And, according to the Terms you annex to it, how &s;hall I acquit my&s;elf of it, without incurring
<PB N="68" REF="69">
the Cen&s;ure of Affectation, if I freely accu&s;e my&s;elf as I may de&s;erve, or of Vanity, if I do not? Indeed, Madam, I have a great many Failings; and you don't know the Labour it co&s;ts me to keep them under; not &s;o much for fear the World &s;hould &s;ee them, for, I ble&s;s God, I can hope they are not capital, as for fear they &s;hould become capital, if I were to let them grow upon me.</P>
<P>And this, &s;urely, I need not have told your Lady|&s;hip, and my Lady Counte&s;s, who have read my Papers, and &s;een my Behaviour in the kind Vi&s;it you made to your dear Brother, and had from <HI>both</HI> but too much Rea&s;on to cen&s;ure me, did not your gene|rous and partial Favour make you overlook my greater Failings, and pa&s;s under a kinder Name ma|ny of my le&s;&s;er: For, &s;urely, my good Ladies, you mu&s;t both of you have ob&s;erved, in what you have read and &s;een, that I am naturally of a &s;piteful, &s;aucy Temper; and, with all my appearing Meekne&s;s and Humility, can re&s;ent, and &s;ting too, when I think my&s;elf provoked.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o di&s;cover'd in my&s;elf, on many Occa|&s;ions, (of &s;ome of which I will by-and-by remind your Lady&s;hip) a Malignancy of Heart, that, it is true, la&s;ts but a little while&mdash;not had it need&mdash;but for which I have often called my&s;elf to Account&mdash; to very little Purpo&s;e, hitherto.</P>
<P>And, indeed, Madam, (now for a little Extrenua|tion, as you expect from me) I have &s;ome Diffi|culty, whether I ought, in the Station to which I am rai&s;ed, to take much Pains to &s;ubdue my&s;elf in &s;ome In&s;tances, that otherwi&s;e it would have become me to attempt to do: For it is no ea&s;y Task, for a Per&s;on in my Circum&s;tances, to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the <HI>ought</HI> and the <HI>ought not</HI>; to be humble without Meanne&s;, and decent without Arrogance. And let me add, That if every body thought as ju&s;tly
<PB N="69" REF="70">
as I flatter my&s;elf I do, of the Inconveniencies, as well as Conveniences, which attend the being rais'd to a Condition above them, they would not imagine all the World was their own, when they come to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd as I have been: For, what with the Contempts of &s;uperior Relations on one &s;ide, (which all &s;uch mu&s;t undergo at fir&s;t) the Envy of the World, and low Reflections ari&s;ing from that Envy, on the other, from which no one mu&s;t hope to be totally exempted, and the Aukwardne&s;s, be&s;ides, with which they &s;upport their elevated Condition, if they have Sen&s;e to judge of their own Imperfections; and if the Gentleman be not &s;uch an one as mine&mdash; (and where will &s;uch another be found?)&mdash;On all the&s;e Accounts, I &s;ay, they will be made &s;en&s;ible, That whatever they might once think, Happine&s;s and an high E&s;tate, are Two very different things.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall be too grave, when your Lady&s;hip, and all my kind and noble Friends, expect, perhaps, I &s;hould give the uncommon Subject a plea&s;anter Air: Yet what mu&s;t that Mind be, that is not &s;eri|ous, when it is oblig'd to recollect, and give Account of, its Defects?</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not <HI>only</HI> accu&s;e my&s;elf, it &s;eems: I mu&s;t give <HI>Proofs,</HI> &s;uch as your Lady&s;hip can &s;ub|&s;cribe to, of my Imperfections. There is &s;o much <HI>real Kindne&s;s</HI> imply'd in this <HI>&s;eeming Hard&s;hip,</HI> that I will obey you, Madam, and produce Proofs in a Moment, which cannot be controverted.</P>
<P>Let me then, in the fir&s;t Place, as to the Self-accu&s;ation of <HI>Spitefulne&s;s,</HI> refer your Lady&s;hip, and tho&s;e of my noble Friends who have read my Papers, to the Character I gave in them of poor Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 146.</NOTE>; al&s;o to hone&s;t Mr. <HI>Colbrand</HI>'s Character, as I gave it, when I &s;u&s;pected he was to be imploy'd for the wor&s;t Purpo&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid <HI>p.</HI> 220.</NOTE>; both of which, tho' not
<PB N="70" REF="71">
untrue in the main, are &s;o drawn, as to &s;hew a very &s;piteful Nature in the Characterizer.</P>
<P>And as to my <HI>Saucine&s;s,</HI> tho&s;e Papers will give an hundred In&s;tances again&s;t me&mdash;as well to your dear Brother, as to others&mdash;Indeed, to extenuate, as you command me, as I go along, the&s;e were mo&s;tly when I was apprehen&s;ive for my Honour, that they were.</P>
<P>And then, my dear Lady, I have a little Tincture of <HI>Jealou&s;y,</HI> which &s;ometimes has made me more unea&s;y than I ought to be, as the Papers you have not &s;een, would have demon&s;trated, particularly in Mi&s;s <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s Ca&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 325, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, and in my Conver&s;ation with your Lady&s;hips, in which I have frequently betray'd my Apprehen&s;ions of what might happen when we came to <HI>London:</HI> Yet, to extenuate again, I have examin'd my&s;elf very &s;trictly on this Head; and I really think, that I can a&s;cribe a great Part of this Jealou&s;y to laudable Motives; no le&s;s than the Con|cern I have for your dear Brother's future Happine&s;s, in the Hope, that I may be an humble Means in the Hands of Providence, to induce him to abhor tho&s;e Crimes in which young Gentlemen too often indulge them&s;elves, and to bring him over to the Practice of tho&s;e Virtues, in which he will for ever have Cau&s;e to rejoice.&mdash;Yet, my Lady, &s;ome other Parts of the Charge mu&s;t &s;tand again&s;t me; for, as, to be &s;ure, I love his Per&s;on, as well as his Mind, I have Pride in my Jealou&s;y, that would nor permit me, I verily think, to &s;upport my&s;elf as I ought, under the Trial of a Competition, in this tender, very tender Point.</P>
<P>And this obliges me to own, that I have a little&mdash; not a little, perhaps&mdash;Spark of <HI>&s;ecret Pride</HI> and <HI>Vanity,</HI> that will ari&s;e, now-and-then, on the Ho|nours done me; but which I keep under as much
<PB N="71" REF="72">
as I can: And to this Pride, let me tell your Lady|&s;hip, I know no one contributes, or can contribute, more largely than your&s;elf.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee, my dear Lady, what a naughty Heart I have, and how far I am from being a faultle&s;s Creature&mdash;I hope I &s;hall be better and better, how|ever, as I live longer, and have more Grace, and more Wit: For here, to recapitulate my Faults, is, in the fir&s;t Place, <HI>Vindictivene&s;s,</HI> I will not call it downright Revenge, that I will not&mdash;For, as the Poet &s;ays,
<Q><L>Revenge is but a Frailty, incident</L>
<L>To craz'd and &s;ickly Minds; the poor Content</L>
<L>Of little Souls, unable to &s;urmount</L>
<L>An Injury, too weak to bear Affront.</L></Q>
And I would not be thought to have a <HI>little Mind,</HI> becau&s;e I know I would not do a <HI>little Thing.

<P>I Arriv'd &s;afely in <HI>London</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> after a to|lerable Journey, con&s;idering <HI>Deb.</HI> and I made Six in the Coach, (Two having been taken up on the Way, after you left me) and none of the Six highly agreeable.

<P>We are happy beyond Expre&s;&s;ion: Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is a charming Husband; &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o pleas'd with, and &s;o tender of his Lady; and &s;he &s;o much All that we &s;aw her in the Country, as to Humility and Affabi|lity, and improv'd in every thing el&s;e, which we hardly thought po&s;&s;ible &s;he could be&mdash;that I never knew &s;o happy a Matrimony.&mdash;All that <HI>Prerogative Saucine&s;s,</HI> which we apprehended would &s;o emi|nently di&s;play it&s;elf in his Behaviour to his Lady, had &s;he been ever &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Birth and For|tune, is vani&s;h'd, and no Traces of it left. I did not think it was in the Power of an Angel, if our Sex could have produc'd one, to have made &s;o ten|der and &s;o fond an Husband of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> as he makes. And &s;hould I have the Sen&s;e to follow Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s Example, if ever I marry, I &s;hould not de&s;pair of making my&s;elf happy, let it be to whom it would, provided he was not a Brute, nor &s;ordid in his Tem|per, which two Characters are too obvious to be conceal'd, if Per&s;ons take due Care, and make pro|per
<PB N="73" REF="74">
Inquiries, and if they are not led by blind Pa&s;|&s;ion. May Mr. <HI>Murray,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy,</HI> make ju&s;t &s;uch an happy Pair!</P>
<P>You commanded me, my honour'd Mamma, to write to you an Account of every thing that pleas'd me&mdash;I &s;aid I would: But what a Task &s;hould I then have!&mdash;I did not think I had undertaken to write Volumes!&mdash;You mu&s;t therefore allow me to be more brief than I had intended.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, It would take up five or &s;ix long Letters to do Ju&s;tice to the Oeconomy ob&s;erved in this happy Family. You know, (and we have often admir'd and applauded her for it) that Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> has not chang'd one of the Servants of the Family, and only added her <HI>Polly</HI> to the Number. This is an unexampled thing, e&s;pecially as they were all her <HI>Fellow-&s;ervants,</HI> as we may &s;ay: But &s;ince they have the Sen&s;e to admire &s;o good an Example, and are proud to follow it, each to his and her Power, I think it one of her peculiar Felicities to have conti|nued them, and to chu&s;e to reform &s;uch as were exceptionable, rather than di&s;mi&s;s them.</P>
<P>Their Mouths, <HI>Deb.</HI> tells me, are continually full of their Lady's Prai&s;es, and Prayers, and Ble&s;&s;ings, utter'd with &s;uch Delight and Fervour for the happy Pair, that it makes her Eyes, &s;he &s;ays, ready to run over to hear them.</P>
<P>Moreover, I think it an extraordinary Piece of Policy, whether de&s;ign'd or not&punc; to keep them (as they were hone&s;t and worthy Folks); for had &s;he turn'd them all off, what had &s;he done but made as many Enemies as Per&s;ons; and as many more, as tho&s;e Per&s;ons had Friends and Acquaintance? And we all know, how much the Reputation of Families lies at the Mercy of Servants; and 'tis ea&s;y to gue&s;s to what Cau&s;e each would have imputed their Di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion. And &s;o &s;he has e&s;caped, as &s;he ought to
<PB N="74" REF="75">
e&s;cape, the Character of Pride; and has made every one, in&s;tead of reproaching her with her De&s;cent, find tho&s;e Graces in her, which turn that very Di&s;|advantage to her Glory.</P>
<P>She is exceeding affable to every one of them; always &s;peaks to them with a Smile; but yet has &s;uch a Dignity in her Manner, that it &s;ecures her their Re&s;pect and Reverence; and they are ready to fly at a Look, and &s;eem proud to have any Com|mands of hers to execute: In&s;omuch that the Words, <HI>My Lady commands &s;o or &s;o,</HI> from one Ser|vant to another, are &s;ure to meet with an indi&s;puta|ble Obedience, be the Duty requir'd what it will.</P>
<P>If any one of them is the lea&s;t out of Order, her Care and Tenderne&s;s for them ingage the Duty, and the Veneration, and Gratitude, of all the re&s;t, who &s;ee in that In&s;tance, how kindly they will be treated, &s;hould they ail any thing them&s;elves. And in all this, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, &s;he is very happy in Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> who is an excellent Second to her admirable Lady; and is treated by her with as much Re&s;pect and Affection, as if &s;he was her Mother.</P>
<P>You may remember, Madam, that in the Account &s;he gave us of her <HI>benevolent Round,</HI> as Lady <HI>Davers</HI> calls it, &s;he &s;ays, That as &s;he was going to <HI>London,</HI> &s;he &s;hould leave Directions with Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> about &s;ome of her <HI>Clients,</HI> as I find &s;he calls her Poor, to avoid a Word, that her Delicacy accounts har&s;h with regard to them, and o&s;tentatious with re&s;pect to her&s;elf. I ask'd her, how (&s;ince, contrary to her then De&s;ign, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> was permitted to be in Town with her) &s;he had provided to an&s;wer her In|tention as to tho&s;e her Clients, whom &s;he had re|ferr'd to the Care of that good Woman?</P>
<P>She &s;aid, That Mr. <HI>Barlow</HI> her Apothecary was a very worthy Man, and &s;he had given him a plenary Power in that Particular, and likewi&s;e de&s;ir'd him to
<PB N="75" REF="76">
recommend any new and worthy Ca&s;e to her, that no di&s;tre&s;sful Circum&s;tance among the de&s;erving and de&s;titute &s;ick Poor, might be unreliev'd by rea&s;on of her Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>And here in <HI>London</HI> &s;he has applied her&s;elf to Dr. &mdash; (her Pari&s;h-mini&s;ter, a fine Preacher, and &s;ound Divine, who promi&s;es at all Opportunities to pay his Re&s;pects to Mr. <HI>B.</HI>) to recommend to her any poor Hou&s;ekeepers, who will be glad to accept of &s;ome private Benefactions, and yet, having liv'd credita|bly, till reduced by Misfortunes, are a&s;ham'd to ap|ply for publick Relief: And &s;he has &s;everal of the&s;e already on her <HI>benevolent Li&s;t,</HI> to &s;ome of whom &s;he &s;ends Coals now on the Entrance of the wintry Sea&s;on, to &s;ome a Piece of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> or <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Linen, or &s;o many Yards of <HI>Norwich</HI> Stuff, for Gowns and Coats for Girls, or <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Cloth for the Boys; and to &s;ome, (of who&s;e Prudence &s;he is mo&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd in laying it out in the way they be&s;t can judge of) Money. And &s;he has moreover <HI>mortify'd,</HI> as the <HI>Scots</HI> call it, 150 <HI>l.</HI> as a Fund for Loans, without Intere&s;t, of 5, 10, or 15, but not exceeding 20 <HI>l.</HI> to an&s;wer &s;ome pre&s;ent Exigence in &s;ome worthy Families, who find the be&s;t Security they can to repay it in a given Time; and this Fund &s;he pur|po&s;es, as &s;he grows richer, &s;he &s;ays, to increa&s;e; and prides her&s;elf every now-and-then, upon her Fruga|lity, to have &s;av'd &s;o much Money already; and e&s;timates plea&s;antly her Worth by this Sum, &s;aying &s;ometimes, Who would ever have thought I &s;hould have been worth 150 <HI>l.</HI> already? I &s;hall be a rich Body in time. But in all the&s;e things &s;he injoins Secrecy, which the Doctor has promis'd.</P>
<P>She told the Doctor, what Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Office was in her Family; and hop'd, &s;he &s;aid, he would give her his Sanction to it; a&s;&s;uring him, That &s;he thought it her Duty to ask it, as &s;he was one of his
<PB N="76" REF="77">
Flock, and he, on that account, her principal Shep|herd, which made a &s;piritual Relation between them, the Requi&s;ites of which, on her Part, were not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with. You may be &s;ure, the good Gentleman very chearfully and applaudingly gave her his Con&s;ent; and when &s;he told him, how well Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> was provided for, and that &s;he &s;hould apply to him to &s;upply her with a Town-Chaplain; when &s;he was depriv'd of him, he wi&s;h'd, that the other Duties of his Function (for he has a large Pari&s;h), would permit him to be the happy Per&s;on him&s;elf; &s;aying, That till &s;he was &s;upply'd to her Mind, either he or his Curate would take care, that &s;o laudable a Method &s;hould be kept up.</P>
<P>You will do me the Ju&s;tice, Madam, to believe, that I very chearfully join in my dear Friend's <HI>Sun|day</HI> Duties, and am not a little edify'd with the good Example, and with the Seriou&s;ne&s;s, Harmony, and Good-will, that this lovely Method contributes to keep up in the Family.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, I never &s;aw &s;uch a Family of Love in my Life: For here, under the Eye of the be&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pected of Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, they twice every <HI>Sunday</HI> &s;ee one another all together, as in the Coun|try, in a Body, &s;uperior as well as inferior Servants; and <HI>Deb.</HI> tells me, after Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> and I are with|drawn, there are &s;uch friendly Salutations among them, that &s;he never heard the like&mdash;Your Servant, good Mai&s;ter <HI>Longman</HI>; Your Servant, Mai&s;ter <HI>Col|brand,</HI> cries one and another: How do you, <HI>John?</HI> I'm glad to &s;ee you, <HI>Abraham!</HI>&mdash;All ble&s;&s;edly met once more! cries <HI>Jonathan</HI> the venerable Butler, with his &s;ilver Hairs, as Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> always di&s;tingui&s;hes him: Good Madam <HI>Jervis,</HI> cries another, you look purely this ble&s;&s;ed Day, thank GOD!&mdash;And they return to their &s;everal Vocations, &s;o light, &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o pleas'd, &s;o even-temper'd in their Minds, as their
<PB N="77" REF="78">
chearful Countenances, as well as Expre&s;&s;ions, te&s;tify, that it is an Heaven of an Hou&s;e: And being wound up thus con&s;tantly once a Week, like a good Eight-day Clock, no Piece of Machinery, that ever was made, is &s;o regular and uniform, as this Family is.</P>
<P>What an Example does this dear Lady &s;et to all who &s;ee her, to all who know her, and to all who hear of her, and have the Grace to imitate her!&mdash; What a publick Ble&s;&s;ing would &s;uch a Mind as hers be, could it be ve&s;ted with the Robes of Royalty, and adorn the Sovereign Dignity!&mdash;But what are the Princes of the Earth, look at them, in every Nation, and what have they been for Ages pa&s;t, compar'd to this Lady? who acts from the Impul&s;es of her own Heart, unaided by any human Example. And how can one avoid thinking of In&s;piration in this Ca&s;e; or that &s;he was dropp'd down, when the creating MIND was forming Angels, (forgive the Enthu&s;ia&s;m, which the Contemplation of her innu|merable Excellencies rai&s;es) to be received into bodily Organs, and to live among Men and Women, in order to &s;hew what the fir&s;t of the Species was de&s;igned to be?</P>
<P>This reminds me of what my honoured Papa &s;aid once at our own Hou&s;e to Mr. <HI>B</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 266.</NOTE> That there was but one &s;uch Angel de&s;cended from Heaven in a thou&s;and Years, and he had got her.</P>
<P>And yet, here is the Admiration: That one &s;ees all the&s;e Duties performed in &s;uch an ea&s;y and plea&s;ant manner, as any body may perform them, for they interfere not with any Parts of the Family Manage|ment; take up no Time from the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Imployments; but rather aid and in&s;pirit every one in the Di&s;charge of all their dome&s;tick Services; and, moreover, keep their Minds in a State of Pre|paration
<PB N="78" REF="79">
for the more &s;olemn Duties of the Day; and all without the lea&s;t Intermixture of Affectation, Enthu&s;ia&s;m, or O&s;tentation. O my dear Papa and Mamma! permit me but to tarry here till I am per|fect in all the&s;e good Le&s;&s;ons, and how happy &s;hall I be!</P>
<P>I am mindful, my dear Mamma, of yours and our good Neighbours Reque&s;ts to Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> to oblige you with the Conver&s;ations &s;he mentioned, the one with the young Ladies related to Mrs. <HI>Towers</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Arthur</HI>; the other with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> on her Father and Mother; a Subject, which always, however humble, rai&s;es her admired Pen, and of Con&s;equence our Expectations; and I will prevail upon her to let me tran&s;cribe them for your Entertainment. She writes down every thing that pa&s;&s;es, which &s;he thinks may one Day be of U&s;e to Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and to her own Children, if &s;he &s;hall live to have any, and to &s;ee them grown up. What a charming Mamma, as well as Wife and Mi&s;tre&s;s, will this dear Lady make!</P>
<P>As to the Town, and the Diver&s;ions of it, I &s;hall not trouble you with any Accounts of them, becau&s;e you know the one, and from the Time we pa&s;&s;ed here la&s;t Winter, as well as your former thorough Knowledge of both, you will want no Information about the other; for, generally &s;peaking, all who re&s;ide con&s;tantly in <HI>London,</HI> allow, that there is lit|tle other Difference in the Diver&s;ions of one Win|ter and another, than &s;uch as are in Cloaths; a few Variations of the Fa&s;hions only, which are mo&s;tly owing to the ingenious Contrivances of Per&s;ons who are to get their Bread by diver&s;ifying them.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> has undertaken to give Lady <HI>Davers</HI> an Account of Matters as they pa&s;s, and her Sentiments on what &s;he &s;ees. There mu&s;t be &s;omething new in her Ob&s;ervations, becau&s;e &s;he is a Stranger to the&s;e Diver&s;ions, and unbia&s;&s;ed intirely by Favour or Preju|dice;
<PB N="79" REF="80">
and &s;o will not play the partial Critick, but give to a Beauty its due Prai&s;e, and to a Fault its due Cen|&s;ure, according to that Truth and Nature which are the unerring Guides of her Actions, as well as Senti|ments. The&s;e I will procure for you, as &s;he gives me Leave to tran&s;cribe what &s;he writes; and you'll be &s;o good as to return them when perus'd, becau&s;e I will lend them, as I u&s;ed to do her Letters, to her good Parents; and &s;o I &s;hall give her a Plea&s;ure at the &s;ame time, in the accommodating them with the Knowlege of all that pa&s;&s;es, which &s;he makes it a Point of Duty to do, becau&s;e they take Delight in her Writings.</P>
<P>My Papa's Ob&s;ervation, that a Woman never takes a Journey that &s;he don't forget &s;omething, is ju&s;tify'd by me; for with all my Care, I have forgot my Diamond Buckle, which Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy</HI> will find in the inner Till of my Bureau, wrapt up in Cot|ton; and I beg it may be &s;ent me, by the fir&s;t Op|portunity.

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. From Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> to Lady <HI>DAVERS.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My good Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU command me to acquaint you with the Proceedings between Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> and Mi&s;s
<PB N="81" REF="82">
<HI>Nanny Darnford</HI>: And Mi&s;s <HI>Polly</HI> makes it very ea&s;y for me to obey you, in this Particular, and in very few Words; for &s;he &s;ays, Every thing was adju&s;ted before &s;he came away, and the Ceremony, &s;he be|lieves, may be performed by this Time. She rejoices that &s;he was out of the way of it: For &s;he &s;ays, Love is &s;o aukward a Thing to Mr. <HI>Murray,</HI> and Good-humour &s;o uncommon an one to Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy,</HI> that &s;he hopes &s;he &s;hall never &s;ee &s;uch another Court&s;hip.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> teizes Mi&s;s, that &s;he is a little piqu'd, and that &s;he &s;hew'd it by a &s;atirical Fling or two in a former Letter to me, that her humble Servant took her at her Word: And yet he acknowleges, that he believes &s;he de&s;pi&s;es him, as by his Conduct he has &s;hewn, that he de&s;erves to be de&s;pi&s;ed by her.</P>
<P>She &s;ays, nothing has piqu'd her in the whole Affair, but the Triumph it gave to <HI>that ill-natur'd Girl,</HI> as &s;he ju&s;tly calls her Si&s;ter, who has in&s;ulted her unmercifully on that Account; and yet with &s;o low and mean a Spite, that &s;he has been vex'd at her&s;elf to &s;hew the lea&s;t Concern on the Occa&s;ion. But un|generous Teizing is an intolerable thing, as &s;he &s;ays; and often repeated, will vex a Mind naturally above it: Had it, &s;ays &s;he, come from any body el&s;e, I &s;hould not have heeded it; but how can one de&s;pi&s;e a Si&s;ter?</P>
<P>We have been at the Play-hou&s;e &s;everal times; and give me Leave to &s;ay, Madam, (for I have now read as well as &s;een &s;everal) That I think the Stage, by proper Regulations, might be made a profitable Amu&s;ement. But nothing more convinces one, than the&s;e Repre&s;entations, of the Truth of the com|mon Ob&s;ervation, That the be&s;t Things, corrupted, may prove the wor&s;t. The Terror and Compun|ction for evil Deeds, the Compa&s;&s;ion for a ju&s;t Di|&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="82" REF="83">
and the general Beneficence which tho&s;e lively Exhibitions are &s;o capable of rai&s;ing in the human Mind, may be of great Service, when directed to right Ends, and induced by proper Motives; where the Actions which the Cata&s;trophe is de&s;igned to puni&s;h, are not &s;et in &s;uch advantageous Lights, as &s;hall de&s;troy the End of the Moral, and make the Vice that ought to be cen&s;ured, imitable; where the Di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;es from proper Motives; where In|&s;truction is kept in View all the Way; and Vice is puni&s;hed, and Virtue rewarded.</P>
<P>But give me Leave to &s;ay, that I think there is hardly one Play I have &s;een or read hitherto, but has too much of Love in it, as that Pa&s;&s;ion is gene|rally treated. How unnatural in &s;ome, how inflame|ing in others, are the De&s;criptions of it!&mdash;In mo&s;t, rather Rant and Fury, like the Loves of the fiercer Brute Animals, as <HI>Virgil,</HI> tran&s;lated by <HI>Dryden,</HI> de|&s;cribes them, than the &s;oft, &s;ighing, fearfully-hope|ful Murmurs, that &s;well the Bo&s;oms of our gentler Sex; and the re&s;pectful, timorous, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Com|plainings of the other, when the Truth of the Pa&s;|&s;ion humanizes, as one may &s;ay, their more rugged Hearts.</P>
<P>In particular, my dear Lady, what &s;trange Inde|licates do the&s;e Writers of Tragedy often make of our Sex? They don't enter into the Pa&s;&s;ion at all, if I have any Notion of it: But when the Authors want to paint it &s;trongly, (&s;uch as in tho&s;e Plays I have &s;een and read) their Aim &s;eems to be to rai&s;e a Whirlwind, as I may &s;ay, which &s;weeps down Rea|&s;on, Religion, and Decency, and carries every laud|able Duty away before it; &s;o that all the Example can &s;erve to &s;hew, is, how a di&s;appointed Lover may rage and &s;torm, re&s;ent and revenge.</P>
<P>The Play I fir&s;t &s;aw, was the Tragedy of the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s'd Mother,</HI> and a great many beautiful Things
<PB N="83" REF="84">
I think there are in it: But half of it is a tempe&s;tu|ous, cruel, ungoverned Rant of Pa&s;&s;ion, and ends in Cruelty, Blood&s;hed, and De&s;olation, which the Truth of Story not warranting, as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> tells me, makes it the more Pity, that the original Author (for it is a <HI>French</HI> Play tran&s;lated, you know, Madam) had not conducted it, &s;ince it was in his Choice, with le&s;s Terror, and with greater Propriety, to the Pa&s;|&s;ions intended, and actually rai&s;ed in many Places.</P>
<P>I need not tell your Lady&s;hip what the Story is; and yet it is nece&s;&s;ary, as you demand my Opinion, that I &s;hould give a little Sketch of it. It is this then:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Achilles,</HI> is betrothed to <HI>Hermione,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Menelaus</HI>; but <HI>Hector</HI>'s Widow, <HI>Andromache,</HI> with <HI>A&s;tyanax,</HI> her Son by <HI>Hector,</HI> in the Divi&s;ion of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Captives, falls to the Lot of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> who &s;light|ing <HI>Hermione,</HI> (actually &s;ent to his Court, and <HI>in</HI> his Court, waiting his good Plea&s;ure to e&s;pou&s;e her) falls in Love with <HI>Andromache.

<P>This is, in brief, the Story.

<P>And fir&s;t, I could not but ob&s;erve, that the Plea of the Princes of <HI>Greece</HI> for the Murder of <HI>A&s;tyanax,</HI> a helple&s;s Infant, to procure which, and for nothing el&s;e, they &s;end one of the chief Princes or <HI>Greece</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> is a very poor one, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd. &mdash; For thus <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> &s;ays, among other very pompous Things:
<Q><L>Have you &s;o &s;oon forgot the mighty <HI>Hector?</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Greeks</HI> remember his <HI>high-brandi&s;h'd</HI> Sword,</L>

<P>What Tragedy Pomp is this! How poor the Plea, from Princes and Heroes, when it is &s;o ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd by <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> in this manner!

<P>But, what if this very <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> after twenty humane and generous Things, which the Poet makes him &s;ay, &s;hews, that all this right Thinking is only owing to his Pa&s;&s;ion for the Mother?

<Q><L>&mdash;And would with Tran&s;port hear</L>

<L>A Husband by your Conque&s;ts: Such a Husband,</L>
<L>Tormenting Thought! who&s;e Death alone has made</L>
<L>Your Sire immortal!&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88">This inrages the Hero; and what he &s;hould have admir'd her for, had his Soul been half as noble as hers, he thus re&s;ents:

<L>The <HI>Son</HI> &s;hall an&s;wer for his <HI>Mother</HI>'s Scorn.</L>
<L>The <HI>Greeks</HI> demand him: Nor will I indanger</L>
<L>My Realms, to plea&s;ure an ungrateful Woman.</L></Q></P>
<P>Accordingly he re&s;olves to &s;acrifice the Child; to do Ju&s;tice to <HI>Hermione,</HI> out of Spite to <HI>Andromache:</HI> And, mo&s;t ungenerou&s;ly, knowing <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> loves <HI>Hermione</HI> to Di&s;traction, tells him, he &s;hall grace his Nuptial Rites, and he will receive <HI>Hermione</HI> from his Hands.</P>
<P>But now again, &s;ee what &s;ucceeds to this: One Look of Favour from <HI>Andromache</HI> rever&s;es all his new Re&s;olves, makes him throw new Indignities on <HI>Her|mione,</HI> new Contempts upon the <HI>Greek</HI> Princes, and &s;hew, that if he acts right in one Point, the &s;aving of the Child, it is from wrong and unju&s;tifiable Motives; and yet the Poet &s;eems to de&s;ign him an amiable Character.</P>
<P>Now, Madam, could not a Di&s;tre&s;s have been formed in this Story from more laudable and proper Motives? Should this Pa&s;&s;ion of unbridled Love be repre&s;ented in &s;uch a &s;trong, &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible Light, to an Audience, who mu&s;t be taught, that the highe&s;t Ingratitude, the mo&s;t rageful Extreme of &s;en&s;ual Pa&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable Actions, and the Sacrifice of all Con&s;iderations of publick Good, and private Right, had Examples all in this Piece to warrant them?</P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> is puni&s;h'd by a cruel A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion &mdash; <HI>Hermione</HI> falls by her own Hand for murder|ing him by the Hands of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and the Phren&s;y of <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> becomes his Puni&s;hment: But what a Scene of Terror does all this rai&s;e? How unlikely
<PB N="88" REF="89">
to be an Exemplar either to publick or private Life? And what a hard Fate is that of <HI>Hermione,</HI> &s;lighted, de&s;pi&s;ed, in&s;ulted, by the Man &s;he lov'd, to whom &s;he was betro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed, and who&s;e Re&s;entment therefore was warranted, had it &s;hewn it&s;elf in almo&s;t any Act &s;hort of the Murder, which, in the Violence of her Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he commanded <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> to perpetrate?</P>
<P>Then, Madam, the Love of <HI>Hermione</HI> for <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> is not, I think, of that delicate Sort which ought to be &s;et before our Sex for an Example.&mdash;'Tis Rage, not Love, that of a Woman &s;lighted; and, however ju&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing our Sex to have &s;uch revenge|ful Hearts, when &s;lighted by the Man they love, is not &s;o exemplary as one would wi&s;h: And be&s;ides, &s;he is repre&s;ented as &s;ometimes <HI>&s;ighing and wi&s;hing for</HI> Ore&s;tes; when a true Love bears not the Thought of any Object, but that one it &s;ighs for, even &s;hould that be ungrateful. Thus it is &s;aid of <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> by her Confidante:
<Q><L><HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> who&s;e Return you oft had wi&s;h'd,</L>
<L>The Man who&s;e Suff'rings you &s;o oft lamented,</L>
<L>And often prais'd his Con&s;tancy and Love.</L></Q></P>
<P>Then <HI>Hermione</HI> repeats her Woman's Words:
<Q><L>That Love, that Con&s;tancy, &s;o ill requited&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>Upbraids</HI> me to my&s;elf; I blu&s;h, to think</L>
<L>How I have us'd him; and would &s;hun his Pre&s;ence.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Motive for this, however, is neither Ju&s;tice nor Genero&s;ity, but Pride; indeed, it mu&s;t be own'd, a Pride too natural to a Female Mind, in &s;uch a Circum&s;tance as hers:
<Q><L>What will be my Confu&s;ion, when he &s;ees me</L>
<L>Neglected and for&s;aken, like him&s;elf?</L>
<L>"Her In&s;olence at la&s;t is well repaid!"</L>
<L>I cannot bear the Thought.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="90">And then, the Moment &s;he &s;ees him, &mdash; this is her blunt Que&s;tion to him, notwith&s;tanding all her Shame to &s;ee him:
<Q><L>How am I to interpret, Sir, this Vi&s;it?</L>
<L>Is it a Compliment of Form or Love?</L></Q></P>
<P>Does this, Madam, &s;hew any thing of the Deli|cacy of Sex or Condition? &mdash; And would one think it right, after &s;he has thus extorted from him a repeated Confe&s;&s;ion of his Love, or <HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> as he calls it, to upbraid him, that it ill becomes the Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Greece, to talk of Love or Dying?</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, Madam, I think none of the Love in this Piece is &s;uch a Love, however &s;uited to <HI>Her|mione</HI>'s Character and Circum&s;tance, as is fit to be recommended to our Example: 'Tis a Love that &s;hocks one, and is rather Rage and Tumult than Love, and &s;ucceeds accordingly. So that of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> is ungovern'd, wild, unju&s;t, ungenerous Caprice. <HI>Her|mione</HI>'s is founded in confe&s;s'd Ingratitude to <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> and &s;he per&s;everes in it to <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> when the Indig|nities put upon her &s;hould have made her &s;ooner wi&s;h for Death than for &s;o perjur'd a Man; and yet, I think, &s;he &s;hews an incon&s;i&s;tent Tenderne&s;s for <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> (as I have hinted) while her Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> flames out with &s;o much Violence.</P>
<P>The Motive of <HI>Andromache,</HI> (for hers is the mo&s;t perfect Character in the Piece, and de&s;igned to be &s;o by the Poet) to &s;ave her Son, is the be&s;t a Woman could have to excu&s;e her for marrying the Man who had &s;laughter'd all her Relations: But the Uncertainty of &s;ecuring that Point, by the mere Formality of joining Hands with <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> and her Re&s;olution to de&s;troy her&s;elf, in Defiance of her Vows ju&s;t plighted to be his, was a &s;trange Expedient to pre&s;erve her Widowhood, and her Child: For was it very
<PB N="90" REF="91">
likely, that a Man &s;o wildly in Love with her, as to forego all other ju&s;t and prudent Con&s;iderations for her, (and who had &s;hewn, that he would have de&s;troy'd her Son, but for the &s;ake of <HI>her</HI> Per&s;on) would, when di&s;appointed by &s;o great a Ra&s;hne&s;s, have hazarded his Realms in Defence of her Son?</P>
<P>But of all Things, commend me to the noble Regard for <HI>Self,</HI> of her Woman and Confidante <HI>Cephi&s;a,</HI> to whom <HI>Andromche</HI> communicates her ra&s;h Pur|po&s;e, injoining her a willing Secrecy; the only way the Poet had to let us know it, as it was not put in Execution; for &s;he &s;hews that Regard to her dear Self, in this tragick Performance, which, in a Comedy, would have rai&s;ed a Laugh, no doubt, as a Satire on Lady's Women:
<Q>Alas! I <HI>fear,</HI> I never &s;hall outlive you!</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Things &s;truck me, Madam, when I &s;aw the Play; and when I came to read it, I was more con|firm'd in my Sentiments. But now I will tran&s;cribe &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, which plea&s;ed me much.</P>
<P>The Storms, and Doubts, and Uncertainty of wild ungovern'd Love, is very naturally, I humbly think, painted in &s;everal Scenes of this Play, in the Characters of <HI>Hermione</HI> and <HI>Pyrrhus</HI>; and no-where more affectingly than in the Upbraidings of <HI>Hermione</HI> to <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> after &s;he found her bloody Purpo&s;es too well comply'd with. Thus:
<Q><L>What, if tran&s;ported by my boundle&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>I could not bear to &s;ee him wed another?</L>
<L>Were you t' obey a jealous Woman's Phren&s;y?</L>
<L>You &s;hould have div'd into my inmo&s;t Thoughts:</L>
<L>My Heart, tho' full of Rage, was free from Malice;</L>
<L>And all my Anger was Exce&s;s of Love.</L>
<L>Why did you take me at my Word? You &s;aw</L>

<L>Why did you not return? Why not con&s;ult me</L>

<Q><L>Ah! Madam, whither, whither do you fly?</L>
<L>Where can your Eyes behold a Sight more plea&s;ing</L>
<L>Than <HI>Hector</HI>'s Widow, &s;uppliant, and in Tears?</L>

<L>But oh! I have a Son: &mdash;And you, one Day,</L>
<L>Will be no Stranger to a Mother's Fondne&s;s.</L></Q></P>
<P>Was not this, Madam, a moving and intere&s;t|ing Plea? And is not what follows affectingly noble?</P>
<Q><L>But Heav'n forbid, that you &s;hould ever know</L>
<L>A <HI>Mother</HI>'s Sorrow for an <HI>only</HI> Son,</L>
<L>Her Joy! her Bli&s;s! her la&s;t &s;urviving Comfort!</L>

<L>Alas! what Danger is there in a Child,</L>
<L>Sav'd from the Wreck of a whole ruin'd Empire?</L>
<L>Let me go hide him in a de&s;art I&s;le.</L>
<L>You may rely upon my tender Care</L>
<L>To keep him far from Perils of Ambition:</L>
<L>All he can learn of me, will be to weep.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">This is &s;weetly moving, nobly pathetick.

<P>Very nobly &s;aid! But I cannot forbear making one Ob&s;ervation on occa&s;ion of Self-murder, which, however the Poets may be ju&s;tify'd by the Examples of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> when they draw their Stories from them, yet, in &s;uch a gloomy, &s;aturnine Nation as ours, where Self-murders are more fre|quent, than in all the Chri&s;tian World be&s;ides, me|thinks all tho&s;e Stories &s;hould be avoided, for pub|lick Entertainment: Or, where there is a Nece&s;&s;ity, as in <HI>Cato,</HI> for Example, to introduce &s;uch a wicked Practice, the bad Example &s;hould be obviated, and the Poi&s;on it may admini&s;ter, antidoted by more forcible Le&s;&s;ons than what the&s;e few doubtful Words expre&s;s&mdash;
<Q>I fear I've been too ha&s;ty!&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>So, in this Tragedy I am &s;peaking of, when <HI>Her|mione</HI> de&s;troys her&s;elf, and <HI>Andromache</HI> de&s;igns to do the like, &s;hould the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poet have left this Pra|ctice unguarded or unaccompany'd by proper Le&s;|&s;ons and Cen&s;ures in &s;uch a Country as ours?</P>
<P>The &s;taggering Doubts and Di&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Hermione,</HI> after &s;he had ingaged-<HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> in the Murder of <HI>Pyr|rhus,</HI> between her Love and her Re&s;entment; her Que&s;tions to her Woman, that as he approach'd the Temple to marry her Rival, in Breach of his Vows of Betrothment to her, whether his Countenance &s;hewed not &s;ome Tokens of Remor&s;e; are very natural to one in her amorous Circum&s;tance, I fan&s;y:
<PB N="96" REF="97">
<Q><L>But, &s;ay, <HI>Cleone,</HI> did&s;t thou mark him well?</L>
<L>Was his Brow &s;mooth? Say, did there not appear</L>
<L>Some Shade of Grief? Some little Cloud of Sorrow?</L>
<L>Did he not &s;top? Did he not once look back?</L>
<L>Did&s;t <HI>thou</HI> approach him? Was he not confounded?</L>
<L>Did he not&mdash;Oh! be quick, and tell me all.</L></Q></P>
<P>This, Madam, I think, is charmingly natural. And on <HI>Cleone</HI>'s An&s;wer, That he went to the Tem|ple all Joy and Tran&s;port, unguarded, and all his Cares imploy'd to gratify <HI>Andromache</HI> in her Son's Safety, the Poet palliates a little, for a rageful Mind to &s;ay,
<Q>Enough! he dies!&mdash;the Traitor!&mdash;Where's <HI>Ore&s;tes?</HI></Q></P>
<P>There are &s;everal Circum&s;tances of Horror in this Play, that &s;hocked me much; but I think none like the De&s;cription the Poet puts into the Mouth of <HI>Pylades,</HI> the in&s;eparable Friend of <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> who, far from avoiding to &s;hock the Soul of his Friend, by gently in&s;inuating the Fate of that <HI>Hermione,</HI> on whom he had fixed his Happine&s;s, thus terribly, with all the Aggravations that could attend &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, points out the horrid Action; taking care even to make her as impious in her Re|proaches of the Deity for her own Ra&s;hne&s;s, as &s;he was in the Violence by which &s;he dies; and &s;o leav|ing a dreadful Example, that I pre&s;ume was not needful to be left, of a final Impenitence, e&s;peci|ally in a &s;uffering Character, that had not merited the Evils &s;he met with.</P>
<P>Thus it is mentioned; and I am affected with the Tran&s;cription of a Pa&s;&s;age, which the Poet has la|bour'd more than he ought, I think, to &s;hew the Force of his de&s;criptive Vein:
<Q><L>Full of Di&s;order, Wildne&s;s in her Looks,</L>
<L>With Hands expanded, and di&s;hevell'd Hair,</L>
<L><PB N="97" REF="98">Breathle&s;s and pale, with Shrieks &s;he &s;ought the Temple.</L>
<L>In the Mid-way &s;he met the Corps of <HI>Pyrrhus:</HI></L>
<L>She &s;tartled at the Sight: Then, &s;tiff with Horror,</L>
<L>Gaz'd frightful! Waken'd from the dire Amaze,</L>
<L>She rai&s;'d her Eyes to Heav'n, with &s;uch a Look,</L>
<L>As &s;poke her Sorrows, and <HI>reproach'd the Gods.</HI></L>
<L>Then plung'd a Poniard deep within her Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And fell on <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> gra&s;ping him in Death.</L></Q></P>
<P>This, from a Friend to a Lover of the mi&s;erable <HI>Hermione,</HI> tho' the Poet might think it the only Way he had left to make <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> run quite di&s;tracted, yet was not, I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, very judiciou&s;ly put into the Mouth of a beloved Friend anxious for his Safety, and to get him off, after the Murder; and who&s;e Part, till now, had been rather that of &s;oothing, like a true Friend, the Sorrows of his Mind.</P>
<P>The Moral of the Story only regards <HI>Andromache</HI>; nor is there, indeed, any thing but Violence and Terror in the re&s;t of the Story and Characters, as if the Poet was determin'd to &s;ink all into one, and make that great, at the Expence of the re&s;t. 'Tis, however, in my humble Opinion, a good one, to &s;hew, that Per&s;ons in Di&s;tre&s;s ought never to de&s;pond, be their Afflictions what they <HI>will</HI>; and ought to have weigh'd with <HI>Andromache</HI> her&s;elf, to make her avoid the Crime of Suicide, which &s;he had re&s;olved upon, &s;ince this Moral is put into her Mouth; but &s;o late, that it &s;eems rather to make her good by an Event &s;he could not fore&s;ee, than by the Prudence of her Reflections, which would not without that Event, have prevented her from a ra&s;h Action, that would have rendered the Moral ineffectual.</P>
<Q><L>Tho' plung'd in Ills, and exerci&s;'d in Care,</L>
<L>Yet never let the noble Mind de&s;pair.</L>
<L>Where pre&s;s'd by Dangers, and be&s;et with Foes,</L>
<L>The Gods their timely Succour interpo&s;e;</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="99">And when our Virtue &s;inks, o'erwhelm'd with Grief,</L>
<L>By unfore&s;een Expedients bring Relief.</L></Q>
<P>Now, Madam, good as this Moral is, I &s;hould rather, in Genero&s;ity, have had it recommended from any Mouth than that of <HI>Andromache</HI>: For what is the Con&s;olation &s;he receives? What are the Expe|dients &s;he &s;o much rejoices in? Why, in the fir&s;t place, the Murder of a Prince who lov'd her more than his own Glory, and to whom &s;he had ju&s;t given her Faith, as a &s;econd Husband, tho' forced to it, from a laudable Motive: And next, The Self-murder of <HI>Hermione,</HI> the Di&s;traction of <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> and the Pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding with her Son to the Throne of the murder'd Prince; from which, how|ever, &s;he could not expect but to be driven, and her Son at la&s;t to be de&s;troy'd, by tho&s;e vengeful Confederates, who had joined, by a &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;y, to demand his Life, and who now, by his Elevation, had &s;tronger Rea&s;ons to apprehend Danger from him; and the le&s;s Difficulty to effect his Ruin, as <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> was no more.</P>
<P>But, judge, my dear Lady, what, after the Play was over, I mu&s;t think of the Epilogue, and indeed of the Audience, who call'd out for it: An Epilogue &s;poken by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> in the Character of <HI>Andro|mache,</HI> that was more &s;hocking to me, than the mo&s;t terrible Parts of the Play; as by lewd, and even &s;en&s;ele&s;s <HI>Double-entendre,</HI> it could be calculated only to efface all the tender, all the virtuous Sentiments, which the Tragedy was de&s;ign'd to rai&s;e.</P>
<P>The Plea&s;ure this was receiv'd with by the Men, was equally barbarous and in&s;ulting; every one turn|ing him&s;elf to the Boxes, Pit, and Galleries, where Ladies were, to &s;ee how they lock'd, and how they &s;tood an emphatical and too-well pronounc'd Ridi|cule, not only upon the Play in general, but upon the
<PB N="99" REF="100">
Part of <HI>Andromache</HI> in particular, which had been &s;o well &s;u&s;tain'd by an excellent Actre&s;s; and I was ex|tremely mortify'd to &s;ee my favourite (and the only perfect) Character, debas'd and de&s;poil'd, and the Widow of <HI>Hector</HI> Prince of <HI>Troy,</HI> talking Na&s;tine&s;s to an Audience, and &s;etting it out with all the wicked Graces of Action, and affected Archne&s;s of Look, Attitude, and Empha&s;is.</P>
<P>I &s;tood up&mdash;Dear Sir!&mdash;Dear Mi&s;s!&mdash;&s;aid I&mdash;</P>
<P>What's the matter, my Love? &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;mile|ing, who expected, as he told me afterwards, to &s;ee me mov'd by this vile Epilogue&mdash;for it is always call'd for, it &s;eems.</P>
<P>Why have I wept the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the injur'd <HI>Hermione?</HI> whi&s;per'd I: Why have I been mov'd by the Murder of the brave <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> and &s;hock'd by the Madne&s;s of <HI>Ore&s;tes?</HI> Is it for this? See you not <HI>Hector</HI>'s Widow, that noble <HI>Andromache,</HI> inverting the De&s;ign of the whole Play, &s;atirizing her own Sex, but indeed mo&s;t of all ridiculing and &s;haming, in <HI>my</HI> Mind, that Part of the Audience, who can call for this vile Epilogue, and tho&s;e who can be delighted with it, after &s;uch Scenes of Horror and Di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>He was pleas'd to &s;ay, &s;miling, I expected, my Dear, that your Delicacy, and Mi&s;s's too, would be &s;hock'd on this prepo&s;terous Occa&s;ion. I never &s;aw this Play, Rake as I was, but the Impropriety of the Epilogue &s;ent me away di&s;&s;atisfy'd with it, and with human Nature too: And you only &s;ee, by this one In&s;tance, what a Character that of an Actor and Actre&s;s is, and how capable they are to per&s;onate any thing for a &s;orry Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Well, but, Sir, &s;aid I, are there not, think you, extravagant Scenes and Characters enough in mo&s;t Plays, to ju&s;tify the Cen&s;ures of the Virtuous upon them, that the wicked Friend of the Author mu&s;t crown the Work in an Epilogue, for fear the Audi|ence

<P>In this wild way, talk'd I; for I was quite out of Patience at this unnatural and unexpected Piece of Ridicule, tack'd to &s;o &s;erious a Play, and coming after &s;uch a Moral.</P>
<P>Here is a Specimen, my dear Lady, of my Ob|&s;ervations on the fir&s;t Play I &s;aw. How ju&s;t, or how impertinent, I mu&s;t leave to your better Judg|ment.

<P>I GAVE you in my la&s;t, my bold Remarks upon a TRAGEDY&mdash;<HI>The Di&s;tre&s;s'd Mother</HI>&mdash;I will now give you my &s;hallow Notions of a COMEDY&mdash;<HI>The Tender Hu&s;band.</HI></P>
<P>I lik'd this Title; tho' I can't &s;ay I was pleas'd at all with its &s;econd; with an explanatory <HI>Or,&mdash;The

Accompli&s;h'd Fools.</HI> But when I was told it was written by Sir <HI>Richard Steele,</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> had given &s;ome Hints towards it, if not &s;ome Cha|racters, O dear Sir, &s;aid I, give us your Company to this Play; for the Authors of the <HI>Spectators</HI> can|not po&s;&s;ibly produce a faulty Scene!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> indeed &s;mil'd; for I had not then read the Play: And the Earl of <HI>F.</HI> his Counte&s;s, Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and my&s;elf, agreed to meet with a Niece of my Lord's in the Stage-Box, which was taken on purpo&s;e:</P>
<P>There &s;eems to me, my dear Lady, to be a great deal of Wit and Satire in the Play: But, upon my Word, I was grievou&s;ly di&s;appointed as to the Mo|rality of it: Nor, in &s;ome Places, is <HI>Probability</HI> pre|&s;erved; and there are divers Speeches &s;o very free, that I could not have expected to meet with &s;uch from the Names I mention'd.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be afraid of being cen&s;ur'd for my Pre|&s;umption, were I to write to any body le&s;s indulgent to my Boldne&s;s, than your Lady&s;hip: But I will make no Apologies to you, Madam.&mdash;Let me &s;ee, then, can I give you the brief Hi&s;tory of this Co|medy, as I did of the Tragedy?&mdash;I profe&s;s I hardly know, whether I can or not; at lea&s;t, whether I &s;hould or not.&mdash;But I'll try.</P>
<P>The Tender Husband, MR. CLERIMONT, has for his Wife a Lady who has travell'd, and is far gone in all the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hions: "She brought me," &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a noble Fortune; and I thought, &s;he had a Right to &s;hare it; therefore carry'd her to &s;ee the World, for&s;ooth, and make the Tour of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> where &s;he learn'd to lo&s;e her Money gracefully, to admire every Vanity in <HI>our</HI> Sex, and contemn every Virtue in <HI>her own</HI>; which, with ten thou&s;and other Perfections, are the or|dinary Improvements of a travell'd Lady."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103">Tender as the Husband was to be &s;uppos'd to the Wife, which, by the way, is not extremely appa|rent, in <HI>proper</HI> or <HI>right</HI> In&s;tances of Tenderne&s;s, I pre&s;ume to think, he &s;hews no great Delicacy to the Sex in general in this Speech.</P>
<P>But what is the Method he takes to reclaim the Lady?&mdash;Why this: He &s;ets a former Mi&s;tre&s;s of his own to work, in Man's Cloaths, to in&s;nare his Lady: And thus he declares him&s;elf&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now I can neither mortify her Vanity, that I may live at Ea&s;e with her, or quite <HI>di&s;card</HI> her, till I have catch'd her a little inlarging her innocent Free|doms, as &s;he calls them. For this End I am con|tent to be a <HI>French</HI> Husband, tho', now-and-then, with the &s;ecret Pangs of an <HI>Italian</HI> one; and therefore, Sir, or Madam,"</Q>
(to his Mi&s;tre&s;s LUCY, under the Name of MR. FAINLOVE, in the Dre&s;s of a young Coxcomb)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are thus equipp'd to attend and acco&s;t her Lady&s;hip."</Q>
A Speech un|nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>Fainlove,</HI> who was dre&s;s'd before for that Purpo&s;e, and had actually won Money, in that Character, of Mrs. <HI>Clerimont.</HI> But the Poet had no other way to let the Audience know it, as it &s;hould &s;eem.&mdash;"It concerns you," continues he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to be diligent: If we (<HI>i.e.</HI> he and his Lady) wholly part&mdash;I need &s;ay <HI>no more:</HI> If we do <HI>not</HI>&mdash;I'll &s;ee thee <HI>well provided</HI> for."</Q></P>
<P>Here's a fine moral Scene open'd, my Lady, with regard to Mr. <HI>Clerimont,</HI> his Lady, and his kept Mi&s;tre&s;s! Mr. <HI>Fainlove,</HI> alias Mrs. <HI>Lucy,</HI> under|takes the Task, in Hopes to live with Mr. <HI>Cleri|mont,</HI> in ca&s;e of a Divorce from his Wife; or to be provided for, in ca&s;e the Plot does not &s;uc|ceed: Which looks pretty plainly, that, to &s;ay no|thing of his Morality, the poor <HI>Lucy</HI> had not met with a generous Man in Mr. <HI>Clerimont,</HI> &s;ince, after the Forfeiture of her Honour, &s;he was &s;till to do a
<PB N="103" REF="104">
more infamous Jobb, if po&s;&s;ible, to procure for her|&s;elf a Provi&s;ion from him.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Clerimont</HI> proceeds to in ctruct the new-made Man, how to behave like a Coxcomb, in or|der to ingage his Lady's Attention, and to join in all her Foibles, till &s;he can furni&s;h him with an Oppor|tunity to detect them in &s;uch a way, as &s;hall give a Pretence for a Divorce; and this in &s;uch free Language and Action, as mu&s;t di&s;gu&s;t any mode&s;t Body.</P>
<P>Then the Poet cau&s;es this faithful Mi&s;tre&s;s, in order to make her Character &s;hine above that of the Wife, and indeed above his own likewi&s;e, to pre&s;ent her Imployer with Bills for 500 <HI>l.</HI> which &s;he tells him &s;he won of his Wife the preceding Night; and makes up 2000 <HI>l.</HI> which Mr. <HI>Clerimont</HI> &s;ays, this unprovided-for Mi&s;tre&s;s of his has won from his Lady, and ho|ne&s;tly given him; or el&s;e he could not, he &s;ays, have &s;upply'd her Gaming Lo&s;&s;es. And <HI>Lucy</HI> declares, &s;he will gain him for ever from his Lady, if &s;he can: Yet, you'll &s;ee, by-and-by, that it is not Love to his particular Per&s;on, more than any other, that is her Inducement: Of cour&s;e then, it mu&s;t be Wicked|ne&s;s for Wickedne&s;s &s;ake!</P>
<P>The next Character is CAPTAIN CLERIMONT, Brother to the other Gentleman, a Man of Fa&s;hion and the World, who being a younger Brother, has his Fortune to make; and we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently, how he propo&s;es to make it.</P>
<P>The next is POUNCE, an infamous Jobber or Broker of Stocks, Marriages, or any thing&mdash;who&s;e Character be pleas'd to take in his own Words:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now 'tis my Profe&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;i&s;t a <HI>free-hearted</HI> young Fellow again&s;t an <HI>unnatural long-liv'd</HI> Fa|ther&mdash;to di&s;incumber Men of Plea&s;ure of the Vexation of unwieldy E&s;tates; to &s;upport a feeble Title to an Inheritance!"</Q>
&mdash;One that Mr. <HI>Clerimont</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="105">
&s;ays, by way of Prai&s;e, he has &s;een prompting a &s;tammering Witne&s;s in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,</HI> that wanted In&s;truction; and could venture his Ears with great Bravery for his Friend.</P>
<P>A wor&s;e Character than this, can there be? Yet is it not produc'd to be puni&s;hed, neither.</P>
<P>The next Per&s;on introduc'd is HEZEKIAH TIPKIN, a Banker in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> of an infamous and &s;or|did Character, and a vile U&s;urer: Who has a beau|tiful Niece, Mi&s;s BRIDGET TIPKIN, over-run with Affectation and Romance; with a great Fortune in Money, which &s;o attracts the Captain, that he &s;up|po&s;es, in &s;ordid, but witty manner enough, all ima|ginable Perfections in her Per&s;on, before he has a Sight of it. This young Lady, by a Treaty be|tween her Uncle <HI>Tipkin</HI> and Sir HARRY GUBBIN, a tyrannical, po&s;itive, hot-headed Country Gentle|man, is de&s;ign'd to be marry'd to HUMPHREY the Son of Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> a Creature &s;o &s;avage, &s;o rough, and &s;o &s;tupid, that there cannot be drawn a &s;tronger Contra&s;te between his Character and that of Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pounce,</HI> who is imploy'd as a Broker in <HI>their</HI> Match, is, for a Reward of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> to cheat them and poor <HI>Humphrey,</HI> and to procure this young Lady for Captain <HI>Clerimont.</HI> Admirable Ju&s;tice and Mo|rality, all round! you'll &s;ay, my Lady.&mdash; For this Pur|po&s;e, Mr. <HI>Pounce</HI> finds Mr. <HI>Humphrey</HI> &s;o great a Fool, that, tho' he never &s;aw him before, he very e&s;ily &s;ets him again&s;t his Father, and again&s;t his Cou|&s;in <HI>Bridget,</HI> and all this on the Wedding-day, in or|der to induce him to make Court to a Per&s;on he tells him of, but never &s;aw: And who &s;hould be this Per&s;on, but the Si&s;ter of <HI>Fainlove, Clerimont</HI>'s Man-dre&s;s'd Mi&s;tre&s;s, which Si&s;ter, however, was to be <HI>Fainlove,</HI> or <HI>Lucy</HI> her&s;elf, with a worthy Intent to impo&s;e upon him as a Wife, this ca&s;t-off Mi&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="105" REF="106">
of <HI>Clerimont:</HI> A ju&s;t, a generous, an exemplary Plot this!</P>
<P>The next Character is an old Maiden Gentlewo|man, AUNT to Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> an antiquated Virgin, who, as <HI>Pounce</HI> &s;ays, has a mighty Affectation for Youth, and is a great Lover of Men and Money&mdash; and &s;he is &s;et over her Niece as a Promoter of the Match with <HI>Humphrey</HI>&mdash;Over this Lady Mr. <HI>Pounce</HI> has a great A&s;cendant, half for &s;ordid Rea&s;ons, and half for amorous ones, which makes her a thorough ridiculous Character; and he introduces Captain <HI>Clerimont</HI> into the Company of the Aunt and Niece; and entertains the former, while the Captain ingages the latter on the Subject of her beloved Romance. The&s;e, with Mrs. <HI>Clerimont</HI>'s Maid <HI>Jenny,</HI> are the principal Characters.</P>
<P>I need not, my Lady, take up much of your Time, or my own, to tell you how they proceed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clerimont,</HI> then, after bearing from his Wife, what hardly any Gentleman could bear, &s;urpri&s;es <HI>Fainlove</HI> as a Man (and a very wicked Scene it is in every Part) taking &s;hocking Freedoms with her: And falling into a feigned Rage, threatening to kill <HI>Fainlove,</HI> the Lady at fir&s;t menaces, and is haughty and arrogant; but finding by her Husband's Beha|viour to <HI>Lucy,</HI> whom he then addre&s;&s;es with Fond|ne&s;s before her Face, that &s;he is trick'd by a Wo|man in Man's Habit, in her Turn would kill the Impo&s;tor as <HI>Lucy,</HI> whom as <HI>Fainlove</HI> &s;he try'd to &s;ave; and a Scene on this Occa&s;ion occurs, to my thinking, very ridiculous. Mr. <HI>Clerimont</HI> then up|braids her Guilt; and, what was hardly ever known in Nature, &s;he reforms <HI>in&s;tantly</HI> on the Spot, and expre&s;&s;es all the Signs of Contrition imaginable. He forgives and receives her, guilty as &s;he is in her In|tention, her Per&s;on only untainted, and an Adultre&s;s in her Mind, as &s;he would have been in Fact, had

<HI>Fainlove</HI> been a Man: And a moving Scene, had it been from proper Motives, follows. <HI>Yet,</HI> (&s;till more prepo&s;terous, excu&s;e me, Madam) afterwards &s;he re&s;umes all her travell'd and non&s;en&s;ical Airs, all her Follies, to help to &s;upport the Piot in favour of Captain <HI>Clerimont</HI> upon Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> and that of <HI>Pounce</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Clerimont</HI>'s again&s;t poor <HI>Humphry,</HI> the only <HI>innocent</HI> Character in the Play, and the only <HI>&s;uffering</HI> one; and this latter, as well as the for|mer Plot, being brought about, a laughing Scene is produced, by Sir <HI>Harry</HI>'s &s;oundly cudgelling his &s;tu|pid Son, for permitting him&s;elf to be &s;o fooli&s;hly drawn in.</P>
<P>Now, my good Lady, can you &s;ee one Character, and, I think, I have given them ju&s;tly, fit to be &s;et up for an Example in this celebrated Play of an Au|thor &s;o celebrated? I mu&s;t own, as I &s;aid before, I was greatly di&s;appointed in my Expectations of it. There is, indeed, a great deal of &s;prightly Wit, and Knowlege of the wicked Part of the World, di&s;|play'd in it, as it &s;eems to me, by what I have heard Mr. <HI>B.</HI> talk &s;ometimes; but there is not one Cha|racter in it, but what is &s;hockingly immoral, and, at the &s;ame time, either <HI>above</HI> or <HI>below</HI> Nature; &s;o that the Ridicule which is intended in it, on the bad Characters, cannot, in my poor Opinion, be ju&s;t or efficacious.</P>
<P>For, fir&s;t, there never, I believe, could be a Gen|tleman, &s;o fooli&s;hly tender, yet &s;o plottingly cruel, to his Lady, as Mr. <HI>Clerimont.</HI></P>
<P>There never could be &s;uch a very fanta&s;tical Lady, as Mrs. <HI>Clerimont.</HI>&mdash;And there is &s;uch an Improba|bility in the intimate Acce&s;s, which <HI>Lucy</HI> in Man's Cloaths has to her; in that Creature's lewd Views, yet faithful and generous Conduct in giving back to <HI>Clerimont,</HI> who had not provided for her, 2000 <HI>l.</HI> won of the fanta&s;tical Lady; and yet in her being &s;o
<PB N="107" REF="108">
little delicate in her <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>Clerimont,</HI> which one would expect &s;hould be her Motive, as to join to trick and marry one of the greate&s;t Fools in the World; that it was &s;urpri&s;ing to me, that it could pa&s;s either Author or Audience.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Tipkin</HI>'s Character is unnaturally, &s;tupidly, yet knavi&s;hly bad.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Harry Gubbin</HI> is a Father, who never could have his Fellow; and after furiou&s;ly bearing his Son, is reconciled to his Marriage, as in&s;tantly as Mrs. <HI>Clerimont</HI> is converted; and that to an unknown Per&s;on, who appears to <HI>him</HI> in Man's Cloaths, for the &s;ake of 3000 <HI>l.</HI> Fortune only, altho' he had been quarrelling with <HI>Tipkin,</HI> about 1000 <HI>l.</HI> out of 10000 <HI>l.</HI> which his Son was to have with <HI>Bridget.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Numps,</HI> his Son, is a Character, take it all toge|ther, quite out of Nature and Probability: 'Tis hard|ly po&s;&s;ible, that a Savage, brought up in a Wood, who never convers'd with Man or Woman, could be &s;o &s;tupid; and ea&s;ily might a Poet form a Plot for a Play, if &s;uch a Character could be admitted, as <HI>Numps</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Aunt is credulous and affected beyond Pro|bability al&s;o.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> delicately indelicate in many Places, and improbably fanta&s;tick in all.</P>
<P><HI>Pounce</HI> &s;hamele&s;sly glorying, and <HI>&s;ucceeding</HI> in his Villainy, and deeming the wor&s;t of Rogueries a Pa|negyrick: And &s;uch Immoralities, mingled with Ob|&s;cenities, that I was glad when the Play was over.</P>
<P>But yet, to &s;ay Truth, there are very pretty De|&s;criptions, and a great deal of Wit and Humour in it. The Dialogue is lively. The Painter's Scene entertaining; and that between Sir <HI>Harry</HI> and <HI>Tipkin,</HI> diverting, tho' low; which, together with the fan|ta&s;tick Airs of Mrs. <HI>Clerimont</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> and the farcical Humours of <HI>Numps,</HI> make it the le&s;s
<PB N="108" REF="109">
Wonder, that &s;uch as did not attend to Nature, Probability, and Morality, were &s;truck with the Life and Spirit of the Performance: And e&s;pecially as Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> who acted Captain <HI>Clerimont,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Oldfield,</HI> who acted Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget,</HI> &s;o incom|parably perform'd their Parts, as mu&s;t have &s;aved a Play even of a wor&s;e Tendency than the <HI>Accom|pli&s;h'd Fools.</HI></P>
<P>The Moral I will tran&s;cribe, altho', I doubt, it is a very inapplicable one to the Characters; and &s;o is far from making Amends for a long Performance, that in &s;uch a Variety of Characters has not <HI>one</HI> mo|ral one in it; not &s;o much as one ju&s;t or generous De&s;ign pur&s;ued throughout the Play:
<Q><L>You've &s;eem th' Extremes of the dome&s;tick Life,</L>
<L>A Son too much confin'd&mdash;too free a Wife.</L>
<L>By gen'rous Bonds you either &s;hould re&s;train,</L>
<L>And only on their Inclinations gain.</L></Q></P>
<P>This I call inapplicable, becau&s;e it was needle&s;s Advice to &s;uch Husbands as Mr. <HI>Clerimont,</HI> for whom it &s;eems de&s;ign'd; for he was generous to Exce&s;s, carrying her abroad to <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and paying all her Debts of Honour implicitly: Whence the Name of the Play, <HI>The Tender Husband.</HI></P>
<Q>Wives, to obey, mu&s;t LOVE&mdash;</Q>
<P><HI>Clerimont</HI> did everything to make a grateful Woman love him, before his &s;trange Plot to reclaim her.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Children <HI>REVERE,</HI></L>
<L>While only <HI>SLAVES</HI> are govern'd by their Fear.</L></Q>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Clerimont</HI> was not treated like a <HI>Slave,</HI> yet is reclaim'd only by <HI>Fear.</HI> So that the Moral &s;eems to be calculated for the <HI>Numps</HI>'s (the Fools and Idiots) and the Sir <HI>Harries</HI>; two Characters, that, as I hum|bly
<PB N="109" REF="110">
apprehend, never were in Nature, any more, it is to be hoped, than are the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It looks to me, in &s;hort, as if the Author had for|got the Moral all the way; and being put in mind of it by &s;ome kind Friend, (Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> perhaps) was at a Lo&s;s to draw one from &s;uch Characters and Plots as he had produc'd; and &s;o put down what came uppermo&s;t, for the &s;ake of Cu&s;tom, without much regard to Propriety. And truly, I &s;hould imagine likewi&s;e, that the Play was begun with a De&s;ign to draw more amiable Characters, an&s;werable to the Title of <HI>The Tender Husband</HI>; but that the Author being drawn away by the Luxuriancy of a Genius, which he had not the Heart to prune, on a general Survey of the Whole, di&s;tru&s;ting the Propriety of that Title, added the under-one: With an &mdash; OR, <HI>The Accompli&s;h'd Fools,</HI> in Ju&s;tice to his Piece, and Compliment to his Audience. And, pardon me, Madam, had he called it <HI>The Accompli&s;h'd Knaves,</HI> I would not have been angry at him, becau&s;e there would have been more Propriety in the Title.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could, for the &s;ake of the Authors, have prai&s;ed every Scene of this Play: I hoped to have Rea&s;on for it. Judge then, my dear Lady, what a Mortification it was to me, not to be able to &s;ay I liked above one, the <HI>Painter's Scene,</HI> and am forc'd to di&s;approve of every Character in it, and the Views of every one.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHO' I cannot tell how you receiv'd my Ob&s;ervations on the Tragedy of <HI>The Di&s;tre&s;s'd Mother,</HI> and the Comedy of <HI>The tender Husband</HI>;
<PB N="110" REF="111">
yet will I proceed to give your Lady&s;hip my Opi|nion of the Opera I was at la&s;t Night.</P>
<P>But what can I &s;ay, when I have mention'd what you &s;o well know, the fine Scenes, the genteel Company, the charming Voices, and delightful Mu&s;ick?</P>
<P>If, Madam, like the Nightingale, one were all Voice, or were all Ear, and lo&s;t to every Sen&s;e but that, and Harmony, &s;urely the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera would be a tran&s;porting Thing! &mdash; But when one finds good Sen&s;e, and In&s;truction, and Propriety, &s;acrific'd to the Charms of Sound, what an unedifying, what a mere temporary Delight does it afford! For what does one carry home, but the Remembrance of having been pleas'd &s;o many Hours by Air, well beaten and play'd upon; which being but Sound, you cannot bring away with you; and mu&s;t there|fore enter the Time pa&s;s'd in &s;uch a Diver&s;ion, into the Account of tho&s;e blank Hours, from which one has not reap'd &s;o much as one improving Le&s;&s;on?</P>
<P>I &s;peak this with regard to my&s;elf, who know nothing of the <HI>Italian</HI> Language: But yet I may not be very unhappy, that I do not, if I may form my Opinion of the Sentiments by the enervating Softne&s;s of the Sound, and the unmanly Attitudes and Ge&s;tures made u&s;e of to expre&s;s the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Men-Performers, and from the amorous Com|plainings of the Women; as vi&s;ible in the &s;oft, the too-&s;oft, Action of each.</P>
<P>Then, tho' I cannot but &s;ay, That the Mu&s;ick is mo&s;t melodious, yet to &s;ee a Hero, as an <HI>Alexander,</HI> or a <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> warbling out his Achievements in War, his military Conque&s;ts, as well as his Love, in a &s;oft Song, it &s;eems to me to be making a Je&s;t of both.</P>
<P>And how much more ab&s;urd is it &s;till, to hear &s;ome dying Chieftain, &s;ome unfortunate Hero, chant|ing forth his Woes and his Calamities, and taking
<PB N="111" REF="112">
his Leave of the World (with le&s;s Propriety than our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Criminals at the fatal Tree) in a Sonetta! What can this move, how can this <HI>pierce,</HI> be the Story ever &s;o di&s;mal, any thing but one's Ears?</P>
<P>Every Nation, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, has its peculiar Excel|lence: The <HI>French</HI> Ta&s;te is Comedy and Harlequin|ery; the <HI>Italian,</HI> Melody and Opera; the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> ma&s;culine and nervous Sen&s;e, whether in Tragedy or Comedy. &mdash;Why can't one, methinks, keep to one's own particular national Excellence, and let others retain theirs? For Mr. <HI>B.</HI> ob&s;erves, That when once Sound is preferr'd to Sen&s;e, we &s;hall depart from all our own Worthine&s;s, and, at be&s;t, be but the Apes, yea, the Dupes, of tho&s;e whom we may <HI>&s;trive</HI> to imitate; but never can reach; much le&s;s excel.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, &s;ometimes, that this Ta&s;te is almo&s;t the only good Fruit our young Nobility gather, and bring home from their foreign Tours; and that he found the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation much ridicul'd on this Score by tho&s;e very People who are benefited by the Depravity. And if this be the be&s;t, what mu&s;t the other Qualifications be, which they bring home? &mdash;Yet every one does not return with &s;o little Improvement, it is to be hop'd.</P>
<P>But what have I &s;aid, what can I &s;ay, of an <HI>Ita|lian</HI> Opera?&mdash;Only, little to the Purpo&s;e as it is, I wonder how I have been able to &s;ay &s;o much: For who can de&s;cribe Sound? Or what Words &s;hall be found to imbody Air?&mdash;And when we return, and are ask'd our Opinion of what we have &s;een or heard, we are only able to an&s;wer, as I hinted above, The Scenery is fine; The Company &s;plendid and genteel; The Mu&s;ick charming for the Time; &mdash;The Action not extraordinary; The Language unintelligible; and, for all the&s;e Rea&s;ons&mdash;The In&s;tru|ction none at all.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="113">This is all that the Thing it&s;elf gives me to &s;ay of the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera; very probably, for want of a polite Ta&s;te, and a Knowlege of the Language.</P>
<P>In my next, I believe I &s;hall give you, Madam, my Opinion of a Diver&s;ion or Amu&s;ement, which, I doubt, I &s;hall like &s;till le&s;s; and that is a <HI>Ma&s;que|rade</HI>; for I fear I &s;hall not be excus'd going to one, altho' I have no manner of Liking to it; e&s;pecially in my pre&s;ent Way.

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> coming up, ju&s;t as I had concluded my Letter, asked me, What was my Subject? I told him, I was giving your Lady&s;hip my Notions of the <HI>Italian</HI> Opera. Let me &s;ee, &s;aid he, what they are, my Dear; for this is a Subject, that very few of tho&s;e who admire them, and fewer &s;till of tho&s;e who decry them, know any thing of.</P>
<P>He read the above, and was plea&s;ed to commend it. <HI>Italian</HI> Operas, &s;aid be, are very &s;ad Things in <HI>England,</HI> to what they are in <HI>Italy.</HI> And the Tran&s;la|tions given of them, abominable; and, indeed, our Language will not do them Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Every Nation, as you take notice, has its Excel|lencies; and you &s;ay well, that ours &s;hould not quit the manly nervous Sen&s;e, which is the Di&s;tinction of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Drama. One Play of our celebrated <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> will give infinitely more Plea&s;ure to a &s;en&s;ible Mind, than a dozen <HI>Engli&s;h Italian</HI> Operas. But, my Dear, in <HI>Italy</HI> they are quite another Thing: And the Sen&s;e is not, as here, &s;acrific'd &s;o
<PB N="113" REF="114">
much to the Sound, but that they are both very compatible.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed, Sir, to give me your Ob&s;ervation on this Head in Writing, and then I &s;hall have &s;ome|thing to &s;end worthy of Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s Acceptation. Do, Sir, pray do.</P>
<P>I will, my Dear; and he took the Pen in his Hand, and wrote the inclo&s;ed; which I beg your Lady&s;hip to return me; becau&s;e I will keep it by me, for my In&s;truction, if I &s;hould be led to talk of this Subject in Company. You mu&s;t let my Si&s;ter know, &s;aid he, that I have given my&s;elf no Time to re-peru&s;e what I have written. She will do well therefore to correct it, and return it to you.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In <HI>Italy,</HI> Judges of Operas are &s;o far from thinking the Drama a Poetical Part of their Opera's Non&s;en&s;e, as the Unskilled in <HI>Italian</HI> ra&s;hly conclude in <HI>England,</HI> that if the <HI>Libretto,</HI> as they call it, is not approved, the Opera, not|with&s;tanding the Excellence of the Mu&s;ick, will be condemned. For the <HI>Italians</HI> ju&s;tly determine, that the very Mu&s;ick of an Opera cannot be com|plete and plea&s;ing, if the Drama be incongruous, as I may call it, in its Compo&s;ition; becau&s;e, in order to plea&s;e, it mu&s;t have the nece&s;&s;ary Con|tra&s;te of the Grave and Light; that is, the Diverting, equally blended through the Whole. If there be too much of the fir&s;t, let the Mu&s;ick expre&s;s, as I may &s;ay, Love and the Tender, ever &s;o much, it will come out heavy and tire&s;ome; if the latter prevail, it will &s;urfeit with Jig and Minuit: Wherefore it is the Poet's Bu&s;ine&s;s to adapt the Words for this agreeable Mixture: For the Mu&s;ick is but &s;econdary and &s;ub&s;ervient to the Words; and if there be an artful Contra&s;te in the Drama, there will be the &s;ame in the Mu&s;ick, &s;uppo&s;ing the Compo&s;er to be a skilful Ma&s;ter.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>WELL, now, my dear Lady, I will give you my poor Opinion of a Ma&s;querade, to which Mr. <HI>B.</HI> per&s;uaded me to accompany Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>; for,
<PB N="115" REF="116">
as I hinted in my former, I had a great Indifference, or rather Di&s;like, to go, and Mi&s;s therefore wanted &s;o powerful a Second, to get me with her; becau&s;e I was afraid the Freedoms which I had heard were u&s;ed there, would not be very agreeable to my apprehen&s;ive Temper, at <HI>this</HI> Time e&s;pecially.</P>
<P>But finding Mr. <HI>B.</HI> cho&s;e to have me go, if, as he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, I had no Objection; I &s;aid, I <HI>will</HI> have none, Sir, I <HI>can</HI> have none, when you tell me it is your Choice; and &s;o &s;end for the Habits you like, and that you would have me appear in, and I will chearfully attend you.</P>
<P>The Habit Mr. <HI>B.</HI> pitch'd upon, was that of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Don, and it well befitted the Maje&s;ty of his Per&s;on and Air, and Mi&s;s cho&s;e that of a young Wi|dow; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> recommended that of a Quaker for me. We all admir'd one another in our Dre&s;&s;es; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> promi&s;ing to have me always in his Eye, we took Coach, and went thither.</P>
<P>But I never de&s;ire to be pre&s;ent at another. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was &s;ingled out by a bold Nun, who talk'd <HI>Italian</HI> to him with &s;uch free Airs, that I did not much like it, tho' I know not what &s;he &s;aid; for I thought the dear Gentleman no more kept to his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gravity, than &s;he to the Requi&s;ites of the Habit &s;he wore: When I had imagin'd, that all that was tolerable in a Ma&s;querade, was the acting up to the Characters each Per&s;on a&s;&s;um'd: And this gave me no Objection to the Quaker's Dre&s;s; for I thought I was prim enough for that naturally.</P>
<P>I &s;aid &s;oftly, Dear Mi&s;s, (for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and the Nun were out of Sight in a Moment) What is become of that Nun? &mdash; Rather, whi&s;per'd &s;he, What is become of the <HI>Spaniard?</HI></P>
<P>A Cardinal attack'd me in&s;tantly in <HI>French:</HI> But I an&s;wer'd in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> not knowing what he &s;aid, Quakers are not fit Company for Red-hats.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">They are, &s;aid he, in the &s;ame Language for a Quaker and a Je&s;uit is the &s;ame Thing.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s was addre&s;s'd by the Name of the &s;prightly Widow: Another ask'd, How long &s;he intended to wear tho&s;e Weeds? And a Footman, in a rich Livery, an&s;wer'd for her Eyes, thro' her Mask, that it would not be a Month.</P>
<P>But I was &s;tartled, when a Presbyterian Par&s;on came up to me, and bid me look after my <HI>Mu&s;ido|rus</HI> &mdash;So that I doubted not by this, it mu&s;t be &s;ome|body who knew my Name to be <HI>Pamela</HI>; and I pre&s;ently thought of one of my Lawyers, who&s;e Characters I gave in a former Letter.</P>
<P>Indeed, he needed not to bid me; for I was &s;orry, on more Accounts than that of my Timorou&s;|ne&s;s, to have lo&s;t Sight of him: Out upon the&s;e na&s;ty Ma&s;querades! thought I; I can't abide them already!</P>
<P>An egregious beaui&s;h Appearance came up to Mi&s;s, and &s;aid, You hang out a very pretty <HI>Sign,</HI> Widow.&mdash;</P>
<P>Not, reply'd Mi&s;s, to invite &s;uch Fops as you to my Shop.</P>
<P>Any Customer would be welcome, return'd he, in my Opinion. &mdash; I whi&s;per this as a Secret.</P>
<P>And I whi&s;per another, &s;aid Mi&s;s, That no Place warrants ill Manners.</P>
<P>Are you angry, Widow?</P>
<P>She affected a Laugh: No, indeed; it i'n't worth while.</P>
<P>He turn'd to me&mdash;and I was afraid of &s;ome &s;uch Hit as he gave me&mdash;I hope, Friend, thou art pre|par'd with a Father for the Light within thee?&mdash; That was his free Word.</P>
<P>Is this Wit? &s;aid I, turning to Mi&s;s: I have enough of this Diver&s;ion, where nothing but coar&s;e Je&s;ts appear <HI>barefac'd.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">At la&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> acco&s;ted us, as if he had not known us: So lovely a Widow, and &s;o &s;weet a Friend! no wonder you do not &s;eparate: For I &s;ee not in this various A&s;&s;embl&eacute;e a third Per&s;on of your Sex fit to join with you.</P>
<P>Not one, Sir! &mdash; &s;aid I &mdash; Will not a penitent Nun make a good Third with a mournful Widow, and a prim Quaker?</P>
<P>Not for more than Ten Minutes, at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly the Nun, a fine Per&s;on of a Lady, with a noble Air, tho' I did not like her, join'd us, and &s;poke in <HI>Italian</HI> &s;omething very free, as it &s;eem'd by her Manner, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s &s;miling An&s;wer; but neither Mi&s;s nor I under&s;tood that Language, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> would not explain it to us.</P>
<P>But &s;he gave him a Signal to follow her, &s;eem|ing to be much taken with his Per&s;on and Air; for tho' there were three other <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Habits there, he was call'd <HI>The &s;tately Spaniard</HI> by one, and <HI>The hand&s;ome Spaniard</HI> by another, in our Hearing, as he pa&s;s'd with us to the De&s;&s;ert, where we drank each of us a Gla&s;s of Champaign, and eat a few Sweet-meats, with a Croud about us; but we appear'd not to know one another: While &s;everal odd Appear|ances, as One <HI>Indian</HI> Prince, One <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Manda|rin, &s;everal Domine's, of both Sexes, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Skip|per, a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rabbi, a <HI>Greek</HI> Monk, an Harlequin, a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ba&s;haw, and a <HI>Capuchin</HI> Frier, glided by us, as we return'd into Company, &s;ignifying, that we were Strangers to them, by &s;queaking out, <HI>I know you!</HI> &mdash; Which is half the Wit of the Place.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> had more Attacks made upon him by Ladies, than we had by Gentlemen; and his fine Per&s;on, noble Air, and a Deportment &s;o &s;uited to his Habit, (only in the Encounter of the Nun, when he had more of the <HI>French</HI> Freedom, as I thought, than the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gravity) made him many Admirers;
<PB N="118" REF="119">
and more, when the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter, who was there in a <HI>French</HI> Dre&s;s, &s;poke to him in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and receiv'd a polite An&s;wer from him in the &s;ame; while there were &s;everal who per&s;onated Foreign Characters, and knew nothing of the Language of the Country, who&s;e Habits they a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>There were divers Antick Figures, &s;ome with Caps and Bells, one dre&s;s'd like a Punch; &s;everal Harle|quins, and other ludicrous Forms, that jump'd and ran about like mad; and &s;eem'd as if they would have it thought, that all their Wit lay in their Heels.</P>
<P>Two Ladies, one in a very fanta&s;tick party-colour'd Habit, with a Plume of Feathers, the other in a ru&s;tick one, with a Garland of Flowers round her Head, were much taken notice of for their Freedom, and having &s;omething to &s;ay to every body. They were as &s;eldom &s;eparated as Mi&s;s and I, and were follow'd by a Croud, where-ever they went.</P>
<P>The party-colour'd one came up to me: Friend, &s;aid &s;he, there is &s;omething in thy Per&s;on, that attracts every one's Notice: But if a Sack had not been a profane Thing, it would have become thee almo&s;t as well.</P>
<P>I thank thee, Friend, &s;aid I, for thy Coun&s;el; but if thou had&s;t been pleas'd to look at home, thou would&s;t not have taken &s;o much Pains to join &s;uch Advice, and &s;uch an Appearance, together, as thou make&s;t!</P>
<P>This made every one that heard it, laugh &mdash; One &s;aid, The Butterfly had met with her Match.</P>
<P>She return'd, with an affected Laugh &mdash; Smartly &s;aid! &mdash; But art thou come hither, Friend, to make thy Light &s;hine before Men or Women?</P>
<P>Verily, Friend, neither, reply'd I; but out of mere Curio&s;ity to look into the <HI>Minds</HI> of both Sexes; which I read in their <HI>Dre&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>A general Satire on the A&s;&s;embl&eacute;e, by the Ma&s;s! &s;aid a fat Monk.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">The Nun whisk'd to us: We're all concern'd in my Friend's Remark.&mdash;</P>
<P>And no Di&s;grace to a fair Nun, return'd I, if her Behaviour an&s;wer her Dre&s;s &mdash; Nor to a Reve|rend Frier, turning to the Monk, if his Mind be not a Di&s;credit to his Appearance &mdash; Nor yet to a Country Girl, turning to the party-colour'd Lady's Companion, if &s;he has not Weeds in her Heart to di&s;grace the Flowers on her Head.</P>
<P>An odd Figure, repre&s;enting a <HI>Merry Andrew,</HI> took my Hand, and &s;aid, I had the mo&s;t piquant Wit he had met with that Night: And, Friend, &s;aid he, let us be better acquainted!</P>
<P>Forbear, &s;aid I, withdrawing my Hand, not a Companion for a Jack-pudden neither!</P>
<P>A <HI>Roman</HI> Senator ju&s;t then acco&s;ted Mi&s;s; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;eeing me &s;o much ingag'd, 'Twere hard, &s;aid he, if our Nation, in Spite of <HI>Cervantes,</HI> pro|duc'd not one Cavalier to protect a fair Lady thus &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>Tho' &s;urrounded, not di&s;tre&s;s'd, my good Knight-Errant, &s;aid the Nun: The fair Quaker will be too hard for half a dozen Antagoni&s;ts, and wants not your Protection: &mdash; But your poor Nun be&s;peaks it, whi&s;per'd &s;he, who has not a Word to &s;ay for her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> an&s;wer'd her in <HI>Italian,</HI> (I wi&s;h I under|&s;tood <HI>Italian!</HI>)&mdash;and &s;he had recour&s;e to her Beads.</P>
<P>You can't imagine, Madam, how this Nun haunted the dear Gentleman!&mdash;Indeed, my Lady, you can't imagine it!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I don't like the&s;e Ma&s;querades at all. Many Ladies, on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, are &s;o very free, that the Cen&s;orious will be apt to blame the whole Sex for <HI>their</HI> Conduct, and to &s;ay, their Hearts are as faulty as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t culpable Men, &s;ince they &s;cruple not to &s;hew as much, when
<PB N="120" REF="121">
they think they cannot be known by their Faces. But it is my humble Opinion, that could there be a Standard fix'd, by which one could determine readily what <HI>is,</HI> and what is <HI>not</HI> Wit, Decency would not be &s;o often wounded, by Attempts to be witty, as it is. For here every one, that can give him&s;elf the Liberty to &s;ay Things that &s;hock a mode&s;ter Per&s;on, not meeting with due Rebuke, but perhaps a Smile, (without con&s;idering whether it be of Contempt or Approbation) mi&s;takes Courage for Wit; and every thing &s;acred or civil becomes the Subject of his frothy Je&s;t.</P>
<P>How el&s;e can one account for the Liberties of Expre&s;&s;ion and Behaviour taken by &s;ome of tho&s;e who per&s;onated Bi&s;hops, Cardinals, Prie&s;ts, Nuns, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> &mdash; For the free&s;t Things I heard &s;aid, were from Per&s;ons in tho&s;e Habits; who behav'd with &s;o much Levity and Indecorum, as if they were re&s;olved, as much as in them lay, to throw tho&s;e venerable Characters into Ridicule, for no other Rea&s;on, than becau&s;e they are by the Generality of the World deem'd <HI>venerable:</HI> But if it was once determin'd, that nothing &s;hould be call'd true Wit, as nothing certainly ought, but what will &s;tand the Te&s;t of Examination, but what is con&s;i&s;tent with Decency and good Manners, and what will make an innocent Heart brilliant and chearful, and give its Sanction to the happy Expre&s;&s;ion, by trying to keep up and return the Ball in like virtuous and lively Raillery; then we &s;hould have our publick Entertainments &s;uch as the mo&s;t Scrupulous might join to counte|nance and applaud.</P>
<P>But what a Moralizer am I! will your Lady&s;hip &s;ay: Indeed I can't help it: &mdash; And e&s;pecially on &s;uch a Subject as a <HI>Ma&s;querade,</HI> which I di&s;like more than any thing I ever &s;aw. I could &s;ay a great deal more on this Occa&s;ion; but, upon my Word, I am quite
<PB N="121" REF="122">
of Humour with it; for I liked my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mr. <HI>B.</HI> better than my <HI>Spaniard</HI>; and the Nun I approved not by any means; tho' there were &s;ome who ob&s;erved, that &s;he was one of the gracefulle&s;t Figures in the Place. And indeed, in &s;pite of my own Heart, I could not help thinking &s;o too.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip knows &s;o well what <HI>Ma&s;querades</HI> are, that I may well be excus'd &s;aying any thing further on a Subject I am &s;o little plea&s;ed with: For you only de&s;ire my Notions of tho&s;e Diver&s;ions, becau&s;e I am a Novice to them; and this, I doubt not, will doubly &s;erve to an&s;wer that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only therefore add, That after an hundred other Impertinencies &s;poken to Mi&s;s and me, and retorted with Spirit by Mi&s;s, and as well as I could by my&s;elf, quite &s;ick of the Place, I feign'd to be more indi&s;po&s;ed than I was, and &s;o got my beloved <HI>Spa|niard</HI> to go off with us, and reached Home by Three in the Morning.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Mind is &s;o wholly ingro&s;s'd by Thoughts of a very different Nature from tho&s;e which the Diver&s;ions of the Town and Theatres in&s;pire, that I beg to be di&s;pens'd, for the pre&s;ent, from the&s;e lighter Subjects. But yet, if it plea&s;e God to &s;pare my Life, as your Lady&s;hip does not di&s;approve of my Remarks, I intend to make a little Book, which I will pre&s;ent to your Lady&s;hip, containing my poor Ob&s;ervations
<PB N="122" REF="123">
on all the Dramatick Entertainments I have &s;een, and &s;hall &s;ee, this Winter; and for this Purpo&s;e I have made brief Notes in the Margin of the printed Plays I have bought, as I &s;aw them, with a Pencil; by referring to which, as Helps to my Memory, I &s;hall be able to give your Lady&s;hip my Thoughts at the Time of &s;eeing them, pretty nearly with the &s;ame Advantage as if I had written them at my Return from each.</P>
<P>I have obtained of Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> and Lady <HI>Darn|ford,</HI> the very great Plea&s;ure of their Permi&s;&s;ion to Mi&s;s to &s;tay with me, till it &s;hall be &s;een how it will plea&s;e God to deal with me; and I owe this Favour partly to a kind Letter written in my Behalf to Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> by Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and partly to Mi&s;s's earne&s;t Reque&s;t to her Papa, to oblige me; Sir <HI>Simon</HI> have|ing made &s;ome Difficulty to comply, as Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> and his Bride have left them, and he &s;ays, he cannot live long, if he has not the Company of his beloved Daughter.</P>
<P>I cannot but &s;ay, I have many more Anxieties and Apprehen&s;ions, than perhaps I ought, on the approaching Occa&s;ion; but I was always a &s;ad Coward, and too thoughtful a good deal: But I have &s;o <HI>much</HI> to lo&s;e; &s;uch a dear, dear Gentle|man to part with, if I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> part with him; &s;uch generous Friends and Lovers, as I may &s;ay, of both Sexes: And then the Circum&s;tance it&s;elf has &s;o many Terrors to an apprehen&s;ive Mind, attending it, that I am out of Breath &s;ometimes at the Thoughts of it, and want to run away from my&s;elf, if I could. &mdash;But it cannot be; and when I charge my Mind with the Reflections that Religion in&s;pires, and ask my&s;elf, Who it was that gave me all the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings? and, Who it is that has a Right to recall them, if He plea&s;es, and <HI>when,</HI> and in <HI>what way,</HI> He plea&s;es? and that if I leave them not <HI>now,</HI> I mu&s;t be &s;eparated
<PB N="123" REF="124">
from them <HI>another</HI> Day; I endeavour to bring my Mind to a Re&s;ignation to the Divine Will.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall I &s;ay, Madam, when I find my Frailty is &s;o much increa&s;ed, that I cannot, with the &s;ame Inten&s;ene&s;s of Devotion, that I u&s;ed to be ble&s;t with, apply my&s;elf to the Throne of Grace, nor, of Con&s;equence, find my Invocations an&s;wer'd by that Delight, and inward Satisfaction, with which I u&s;ed to plea&s;e my&s;elf, when the pre&s;ent near Pro&s;pect was more remote?</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall not be de&s;erted in the Hour of Trial, and that this my Weakne&s;s of Mind will not be puni&s;h'd with a &s;piritual Dereliction, for &s;uffering my&s;elf to be too much attach'd to tho&s;e worldly Delights and Plea&s;ures which no Mortal ever injoy'd in a more exalted Degree than my&s;elf. And I be&s;eech you, my deare&s;t Lady, let me be always remember'd in your Prayers &mdash; <HI>Only</HI> for a Re&s;igna|tion to the Divine Will; a <HI>chearful</HI> Re&s;ignation! I pre&s;ume not to pre&s;cribe to His gracious Providence; for if one has but <HI>that,</HI> one has every thing that one need to have. Yet, my dear Lady, there is &s;uch a natural Repugnance between Life and Death, that Nature will &s;hrink, when one comes to the Trial, let one have never &s;o much Fortitude at a Di&s;tance. Yet, I hope, I may be forgiven; for now-and-then I comfort my&s;elf with the Divine Exemplar, which prayed in bloody Sweats for the bitter Cup to be removed; but gave us the Example of Re&s;ignation, that I am wi&s;hing to be able to follow: <HI>However, not mine, but thy Will be done!</HI></P>
<P>Forgive me, my deare&s;t Lady, for being &s;o deeply &s;erious. I have ju&s;t now been contending with a &s;evere Pang, that is, for the pre&s;ent, gone off; what Effect its Return may have, God only knows.

<P>ALTHO' I believe it is needle&s;s to put a Gen|tleman of your generous Spirit in mind of doing a worthy Action; yet, as I do not know whether you have thought of what I am going to hint to you, I cannot forbear a Line or two with regard to the good old Couple in <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;ure, if, for our Sins, God Almighty &s;hould take from us my incomparable Si&s;ter, (forgive me, my dear Brother, but to intimate what <HI>may</HI> be, altho' I hourly pray, as her trying Minute approaches, that it will not) you will, for her &s;ake, take care that her hone&s;t Parents have not the Lo&s;s of your Favour, to deepen the incon&s;olable one, they will have, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, of the be&s;t of Daughters.</P>

dutiful and grateful Heart; and I do not know, if it will not contribute, more than any <HI>one</HI> Thing, to make her go thro' her Task with Ea&s;e and Safety.</P>
<P>I know how much your Heart is wrapp'd up in the dear Creature: And you are a worthy Brother, to let it be &s;o! &mdash; You will excu&s;e me therefore, I am &s;ure, for this my Officiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

I have only therefore to acknowlege, with the deepe&s;t Sen&s;e of your Goodne&s;s to me, and with the mo&s;t Heart-affecting Gratitude, that from the happy, the thrice happy Hour, that you &s;o generou&s;ly made me yours, till <HI>this</HI> Moment, you have not left me one Thing, on my own Part, to wi&s;h for, but the Continuance and Increa&s;e of your Felicity, and that I might be worthier and worthier of the unexampled Goodne&s;s, Tenderne&s;s, and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, where|with you have always treated me.</P>
<P>No, my deare&s;t, my be&s;t beloved Ma&s;ter, Friend, Husband, my <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> my <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and <HI>only</HI> Love! believe me, I have nothing to wi&s;h for but your Honour and Felicity, temporary and eternal; and I make no doubt, that God, in his infinite Goodne&s;s and Mercy, will perfect his own good Work, begun in your dear Heart; and whatever may now happen, give us a happy Meeting never more to part from one another. For, altho', as you were plea&s;ed to que&s;tion t'other Day, when you were re&s;olving &s;ome of my Doubts&mdash;(and, Oh! what a &s;weet Expo&s;itor have you been to me upon all tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, on which my diffident Mind led me to you for Information and Direction!) whether the Happine&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ed was not too exalted an Happine&s;s to be &s;ubjected to

the poor Ties of Relation&s;hip and Sen&s;e, which now delight, and attach &s;o much to them, our narrow Minds and Conceptions; yet cannot I willingly give up the plea&s;ing, the <HI>charming</HI> Hope, that I &s;hall one Day rejoice, <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hingly</HI> rejoice, in the Society of my be&s;t beloved Husband and Friend, and in that of my dear Parents; and I will keep and incou|rage this dear Hope, &s;o con&s;olatory to us in the Separation, which deare&s;t Friends <HI>mu&s;t</HI> experience, &s;o long as it can &s;tand me in any &s;tead; and till I &s;hall be all Intellect, and above the &s;oothing Impre&s;&s;ions which are now &s;o agreeable to Sen&s;e, and to conjugal and filial Piety.</P>
<P>Let me then beg of you, my deare&s;t Protector, and be&s;t Friend, to pardon all my Imperfections and Defects; and if, ever &s;ince I have had the Honour to be yours, I have in <HI>Looks,</HI> or in <HI>Word,</HI> or in <HI>Deed,</HI> given you Cau&s;e to wi&s;h me other than I was, that you will kindly put it to the Score of natural Infirmity (for in Thought or Intention, I can truly boa&s;t, I never wilfully err'd).

and among the re&s;t, a little Parcel, indor&s;ed, Mr. <HI>H:</HI> and P. <HI>Barlow.</HI> The Title will &s;urpri&s;e you; but as I know not what may happen to make Doubts and Puzzles in the Affair mentioned in tho&s;e Papers, when I cannot obviate them, I thought it was be&s;t to give a brief Hi&s;tory of it in Writing, with his Letter to me on the Occa&s;ion; and I humbly beg, the Whole may be kept within your own Brea&s;t, unle&s;s that vile Affair, which has much di&s;turb'd me, &s;hould be reviv'd: Altho' I have no Rea&s;on to ap|prehend it will, becau&s;e the poor Girl, I hope, is &s;incerely penitent, and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> him&s;elf &s;eems in an|other way of thinking as to her.</P>
<P>Will you be plea&s;ed, Sir, to be&s;tow on my deare&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> as a Remembrance of her Aunt's true Love, the Diamond Solitaire, and the &s;econd Pair of Ear-rings? Perhaps, my deare&s;t Lady <HI>Davers</HI> would not di&s;dain to wear, as a Pre&s;ent from her beloved Brother, my be&s;t Diamond Ring. And if my mo&s;t beloved and mo&s;t valued Ring of all, the dear fir&s;t Pledge of my Happine&s;s, were, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince I was honoured with it, by your own putting it on, taken from my Finger and inamell'd, it would be a mournful, yet a plea&s;ing Token for my poor Mother, and a &s;weet <HI>Memento</HI> of your Bounty to them, and of your inexpre&s;&s;ible Good|ne&s;s and Favour to her poor Daughter! &mdash; But how I pre&s;ume! And yet ju&s;t now &s;aid, I had no|thing to ask!</P>
<P>Now I am, unawares to my&s;elf, upon the Subject of petitioning, how it would plea&s;e me, could I know it, if the dear Child I have ju&s;t named, were given to the Care and Example of my excellent Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> if &s;he would be plea&s;ed to accept of the Tru&s;t; and if Lady <HI>Davers</HI> has no Objection, and would not chu&s;e to take the pretty Soul under her own Wing!</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">I had once great Plea&s;ure in the Hope of having this dear Mi&s;s committed to my Care&mdash; But what Plea&s;ures, what Happine&s;s, have I not had crouded into this la&s;t, and this fir&s;t happy, thrice happy Year&mdash; even more than mo&s;t of my Sex have had to boa&s;t of, and tho&s;e not unhappy neither, in a long, long Life! Every Day has brought with it &s;ome new Felicity, &s;ome new Happine&s;s, as unlook'd for, as unde&s;erv'd; for, Oh! be&s;t Beloved of my Heart, how have you always met me in your Comings-in, left me at your Goings-out, with Smiles and Complacency, the <HI>latter</HI> only di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the <HI>former,</HI> by a kind Regret, as the <HI>other</HI> was from <HI>that,</HI> by a Joy, next to Tran&s;port, when all <HI>your</HI> dear generous Heart appeared in your noble Coun|tenance, and &s;et <HI>my</HI> faithful one into re&s;pon&s;ive Flutters, to meet and receive it with all the grateful Emotions that the cha&s;te&s;t conjugal Flame could in&s;pire!&mdash;</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not dwell upon the&s;e charming, charm|ing Reflections!&mdash; My pre&s;ent Doubts will not per|mit me to indulge them!

<P>But let me &s;ay one Word for my dear worthy Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI> Her Care and Fidelity will be very

nece&s;&s;ary for your Affairs, dear Sir, while you remain &s;ingle, which I hope will not be long. But when|ever, Sir, you make a &s;econd Choice, be plea&s;ed to allow her &s;uch an Annuity as may make her inde|pendent, and pa&s;s away the Remainder of her Life with Comfort and Ea&s;e. And this the rather I pre|&s;ume to reque&s;t, as my late honoured Lady <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. III. p. 203.</NOTE> once intimated the &s;ame thing to your Genero&s;ity. If I were to name what that may be, it would not be with the Thought of <HI>heightening,</HI> but of <HI>limiting</HI> rather, the natural Bounty of your Heart; and Fifty Pounds a Year would be a rich Provi&s;ion in her Opinion, and will intail upon you, dear Sir, the Ble&s;&s;ings of one of the faithfulle&s;t and worthie&s;t Hearts in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Nor will Chri&s;tian Charity permit me to forget the once wicked, but now penitent <HI>Jewkes.</HI> I un|der&s;tand by Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> that &s;he begs for nothing but to have the Plea&s;ure of dying in your Service, and of having, by that means, an Opportunity given her of atoning for &s;ome &s;mall Slips and Mi&s;takes in her Accounts, which &s;he had made formerly, as &s;he accu&s;es her&s;elf; for &s;he will have it, that Mr. <HI>Long|man</HI> has been better to her than &s;he de&s;erv'd in pa&s;|&s;ing one <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See, for a Hint of this, <HI>Vol. I. p. 87.</HI></NOTE> Account particularly, to which he had, with too much Rea&s;on, objected. Do, dear Sir, if your <HI>future</HI> happy Lady has no <HI>great</HI> Di&s;like to the poor Woman, be plea&s;ed to grant her Reque&s;t, ex|cept her own Mind &s;hould alter, and &s;he de&s;ire her Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion: And be plea&s;ed to pre&s;ent her with my little Book of &s;elect Devotions, with my Notes in the Inter-leaves: It is in the bottom Drawer of the Right-hand, among my devotional Mi&s;cellanies: Or rather, much rather, be plea&s;ed to order a Copy of

it to be made out for her, and to give the Original, being mo&s;tly my own Hand-writing, to my dear Father. This is a better Thought by much; for the dear good Man will e&s;teem it the more for that. I wonder I did not think of this before.&mdash;</P>
<P>To the other Servants, I have only to leave my Thanks, and be&s;t Wi&s;hes, for their re&s;pectful Love and dutiful Behaviour to one, who from being once hardly the Equal to &s;ome of them, has been exalted to the honourable Station of their Mi&s;tre&s;s, by your &s;uperlative Goodne&s;s and Favour. No Servants, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> ever de&s;erved a Mi&s;tre&s;s's Thanks, if they do not; for they, every one of them, mo&s;t chearfully came into all my little Schemes and Regu|lations, and they have incouraged me, by their ready Obedience, and their re&s;pectful Loves, to pur&s;ue to them the natural Dictates of my own Heart, and have made all A&s;&s;umings and Pride as unnece&s;&s;ary, as they would have been grievous to me, and cen|&s;urable by every one el&s;e: For was it not my high Concern &s;o to behave my&s;elf to all, Low as well as High, that my be&s;t beloved Benefactor &s;hould not, by <HI>my</HI> Arrogance or Inattention, have Cen&s;urers of <HI>him,</HI> added to Enviers of <HI>me,</HI> for the Step he had taken, &s;o derogatory to his own Honour, and to that of his antient and &s;plendid Family?</P>
<P>To the Favour of the be&s;t of Ma&s;ters I therefore leave them, with this Te&s;timony of their Merits, and my kind Regard to them, which makes me venture to call them, without one Exception, from my Silver-hair'd <HI>Jonathan,</HI> to the lowe&s;t Menial, <HI>The be&s;t Set of Servants</HI> that Gentleman ever had: Nor, by Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s Account of the Behaviour of tho&s;e at the Hall, do I find them at all unworthy of being cla&s;s'd with the&s;e here, in the happy Character. And let me &s;ay, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that I have been not a little attentive to their re&s;pective Behaviours,
<PB N="133" REF="134">
as well from my own, as (more particularly) from Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations; becau&s;e I thought it my Duty, as well in Ju&s;tice to your dear Self, as to them.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Polly Barlow,</HI> to whom I was willing to behave with an Eye to my dear good Lady's Kind|ne&s;s to my&s;elf, I have nothing to &s;ay, by way of Di&s;tinction from the re&s;t; having hinted to Mrs. <HI>Jer|vis</HI> to give her <HI>her</HI> Advice, from time to time, and that if a good hone&s;t Husband &s;hould offer, &s;he &s;hould advi&s;e the poor Girl not to decline it.</P>
<P>Forgive me, deare&s;t Sir, for thus mentioning to you, in this &s;olemn Letter, &s;o particularly, your Ser|vants. But the Plea&s;ure which their Regularity and Worthine&s;s have given me, together with the Know|lege I have of their Fidelity and affectionate Duty to You, methinks call for this Te&s;timony of my Sa|tisfaction in them, and Recommendation of them to your Favour.</P>
<P>And now, what have I farther to &s;ay, but to beg of God to &s;hower down his mo&s;t precious Ble&s;&s;ings upon you, my deare&s;t, my <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> my <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and my <HI>only</HI> Love! and to return to You an hundred-fold, the Benefits, which you have conferr'd upon Me and Mine, and upon &s;o many poor Souls, as you have ble&s;s'd thro' my Hands! And that you may in your next Choice be happy with a Lady, who may have every thing I want; and who may love and honour you, with the &s;ame affectionate Duty, which has been my Delight, and my Glory to pay you: For in this, I am &s;ure, no one <HI>can</HI> exceed me!&mdash; And after having given you long Life, Pro&s;perity, and Increa&s;e of Honour, tran&s;late you into a ble&s;&s;ed Eternity, where, through the Merits of our common Redeemer, I hope I &s;hall be allowed a Place, and be permitted (O let me indulge that plea&s;ing, that <HI>con|&s;olatory</HI> Thought!) to receive and rejoice in my re|&s;tored

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. From Mi&s;s <HI>DARNFORD</HI> to Lady <HI>DARNFORD.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My honoured Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot conceive how you and my dear Papa have delighted the Heart of my good Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> and obliged her Mr. <HI>B.</HI> by the Permi&s;&s;ion you have given me to attend her till the important Hour &s;hall be over with her; for the dear Lady is exceed|ingly apprehen&s;ive, and one can hardly blame her; for I don't believe there is &s;uch a happy Couple in the World.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear, that the Ceremony is over, &s;o much to both your Satisfactions: May this Matrimony be but a Tenth Part as happy, as that I am Witne&s;s to; and Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Murray</HI> will have that to boa&s;t of, which few married People have, even among tho&s;e we call happy!</P>
<P>For my Part, I believe I &s;hall never care to marry at all; for tho' I cannot be &s;o de&s;erving, yet I &s;hall not bear to think of an Husband much le&s;s excellent than Mr. <HI>B.</HI> And by what I &s;ee in <HI>her</HI> Apprehen&s;ions, and by what I can conceive of the <HI>Circum&s;tance,</HI> I don't think a young Lady can be requited with a <HI>le&s;s</HI> worthy one, for all &s;he &s;uffers on an Husband's
<PB N="135" REF="136">
Account, and for the &s;ake of <HI>his</HI> Family and Name.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Andrews,</HI> a di&s;creet worthy Soul, as ever I knew, and who in her A&s;pect and Behaviour, is far from being a Di&s;grace even to Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Lady, is with her dear Daughter, to her no &s;mall Satisfaction, as you may &s;uppo&s;e; who now-and-then &s;ays, What a fooli&s;h Creature, my dear Mother, have you for a Daughter!&mdash; <HI>You</HI> did not behave &s;o weakly as I do, when you were in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, I dare &s;ay; and yet you had a dear good Husband, tho' not a rich one, to hope to live for!&mdash;But, come, I will have a good Heart, to make my&s;elf as worthy of the Company and Chearings of Three &s;uch Friends, as I am ble&s;s'd with, in my Mother, my Mi&s;s <HI>Darn|ford,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Jervis!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> ask'd my Advice Ye&s;terday, about having in the Hou&s;e a Midwife, to be at hand, at a Mo|ment's Warning. I told him I fear'd the Sight of &s;uch a Per&s;on would terrify her: And &s;o he in&s;tantly &s;tarted an Expedient, which her Mother, Mrs. <HI>Jer|vis,</HI> and my&s;elf, approved of, and have put into Practice; for, this Day, I have Mrs. <HI>Harris,</HI> a di|&s;tant Relation of <HI>mine,</HI> tho' not of yours, Sir and Madam, come to make me a Vi&s;it from <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was &s;o good as to prevail upon her, in <HI>Com|pliment to me,</HI> as was pretended, to accept of her Board in his Hou&s;e, while &s;he &s;tays in Town, which, &s;he &s;ays, will be about a Week.</P>
<P>Now, you mu&s;t know, that this Mrs. <HI>Harris</HI> be|ing a di&s;creet, mode&s;t, matron-like Per&s;on, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> took a Liking to her at fir&s;t Sight, and is already very familiar with her; and under&s;tanding that &s;he is a Gentlewoman who was a Doctor of Phy&s;ick's Lady, and takes as much Delight in admini&s;tring to the Health of her own Sex, as her Husband u&s;ed to do to that of both, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, It is very fortunate,
<PB N="136" REF="137">
that &s;he has &s;o experienc'd a Lady to con&s;ult, as &s;he is &s;uch a Novice in her own Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> however, to carry on the hone&s;t Impo|&s;ture better, ju&s;t now, in Pre&s;ence of Mrs. <HI>Harris,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Andrews,</HI> and me, ask'd the former, If it was not nece&s;&s;ary to have in the Hou&s;e the good Woman? This frighted Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> who turn'd pale, and &s;aid &s;he could not bear the Thoughts of it. Mrs. <HI>Harris</HI> &s;aid, It was highly nece&s;&s;ary, that Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> if &s;he would not permit the Gentlewoman to be in the Hou&s;e, &s;hould &s;ee her; and that then, &s;he apprehended, there would be no Nece&s;&s;ity, as &s;he &s;uppos'd &s;he did not live far off, to have her in the Hou&s;e, &s;ince Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> was &s;o unea&s;y upon that Ac|count. This pleas'd Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> much, and Mrs. <HI>Tho|mas</HI> was admitted to attend her.</P>
<P>Now, you mu&s;t know, that this is the A&s;&s;i&s;tant of my new Relation; and &s;he, being appris'd of the Matter, came; but never did I &s;ee &s;o much Shy|ne&s;s and Apprehen&s;ion as Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;hew'd all the time Mrs. <HI>Thomas</HI> was with her, holding &s;ometimes her Mother, &s;ometimes Mrs. <HI>Harris,</HI> by the Hand, and being ready to &s;weat with Terror.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Harris</HI> &s;crap'd Acquaintance with Mrs. <HI>Tho|mas,</HI> who, pretending to recollect her, gave Mrs. <HI>Harris</HI> great Prai&s;es; which increas'd Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s Con|fidence in her: And &s;he undertakes to govern the Whole &s;o, that the dreaded Mrs. <HI>Thomas</HI> need not come till the very Moment; which is no &s;mall Plea|&s;ure to the dear over-nice Lady. And &s;he &s;eems every Hour to be better pleas'd with Mrs. <HI>Harris,</HI> who, by her prudent Talk, will more and more fa|miliarize her to the Circum&s;tance, unawares to her|&s;elf in a manner. But notwith&s;tanding this Precau|tion, of a Midwife in the Hou&s;e, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> intends to have a Gentleman of the Profe&s;&s;ion in Readine&s;s, for fear of the wor&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="138">I tell Mr. <HI>B.</HI> he is very happy, in this Stratagem; but that, I &s;uppo&s;e, he has been more us'd to Contri|vances of this &s;ort, than he ought; and was &s;o free as to add, That I pre&s;um'd his Lady is hardly the fir&s;t he has cheated into a Child. And, indeed, I think, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s Merit to the re&s;t of her Sex, is very great, were it only in reforming &s;uch an un|commonly agreeable and manly Rake as this; for no doubt he has done, and would have done, a world of Mi&s;chief among the Thoughtle&s;s and In|di&s;creet in Upper Life; for his Ta&s;te, when at the wor&s;t, always lay, it &s;eems, above the Vulgar.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> has written a Letter, and the Super&s;cri|ption following will tell you to whom it is directed:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To the ever honour'd and ever dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> with Prayers for his Health, Honour, and Pro&s;perity in this World, and everla&s;ting Felicity in that to come. <HI>P. B.</HI>"</Q>
It is &s;eal'd with black Wax, and &s;he gave it me this Moment, on her being taken ill, to give to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> if &s;he dies. But GOD, of his Mercy, avert that! and pre&s;erve the dear Lady, for the Honour of her Sex, and the Happine&s;s of all that know her, and particularly for that of your <HI>Polly Darnford</HI>; for I cannot have a greater Lo&s;s, I am &s;ure, while my honour'd Papa and Mamma are living: And may that be for many, very many, hap|py Years!</P>
<P>I will not clo&s;e this Letter, till all is over: Hap|pily, as I hope! &mdash; Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> is better again, and has, occa&s;ionally, made &s;ome fine Reflections, directing her&s;elf to me, but de&s;ign'd for the Benefit of her <HI>Polly,</HI> on the Subject of the Incon&s;ideration of &s;ome of our Sex, with regard to this Circum&s;tance; in|ferring, that if <HI>&s;uch</HI> are <HI>her</HI> Apprehen&s;ions, tho' a lawful Wife, and <HI>&s;uch</HI> the Danger attending this Ca&s;e, how mu&s;t it leave a poor Creature de&s;titute of all

&s;piritual Con&s;olation, (as well as of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Comfortings of the neare&s;t Friends, and of a kind Husband) when &s;he has &s;acrific'd her Honour, and cannot think of any thing &s;o probable, as the Moment approaches, but that God will puni&s;h her <HI>in Kind,</HI> as &s;he called it; that is to &s;ay, added &s;he, by the very Sufferings, which are the natural Con&s;e|quences of the Sin &s;he has &s;o wickedly committed!</P>
<P>I knew what her De&s;ign was, and &s;aid, Ay, <HI>Polly,</HI> let you and me, and every &s;ingle young Body, bear the&s;e Reflections in Mind, pronounced by &s;o excel|lent a Lady, in Moments &s;o arduous as the&s;e!</P>
<P>The Girl wept, and very movingly fell down by the Door, on her Knees, praying to God to pre&s;erve her dear Lady, and &s;he &s;hould be happy for ever! &mdash;<HI>That,</HI> as Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;o often prettily writes, <HI>was her Word!</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> is exceedingly pleas'd with my new Re|lation, Mrs. <HI>Harris,</HI> as we call her, who behaves with &s;o much Prudence, that &s;he &s;u&s;pects nothing, and told Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;he wi&s;h'd nobody el&s;e was to come near her. And as &s;he goes out (being a Per&s;on of Eminence in her way) two or three times a Day, and la&s;t Night &s;taid out late, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, &s;he hop'd &s;he would not be out, when &s;he &s;hould wi&s;h her to be at home.</P>
<P>I have the Plea&s;ure, the very great Plea&s;ure, my dear Papa and Mamma, to acquaint you, and I know you will rejoice with me upon it, that ju&s;t half an Hour ago, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> was brought to-bed of a fine Boy.</P>
<P>We are all out of our Wits for Joy almo&s;t. I ran down to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> my&s;elf, who receiv'd me with trembling Impatience. A Boy! a fine Boy! dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid I: A Son and Heir indeed!</P>

<P>A Man and Hor&s;e is di&s;patch'd already to Lady <HI>Davers</HI>; and another order'd to <HI>Kent,</HI> to the good old Man.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> when I went up, &s;aid, &s;he mu&s;t go down, and relea&s;e the good Folks from their Knees; for, half an Hour before, they declar'd they would not &s;tir from that Po&s;ture, till they heard how it went with their Lady; and when the happy News was brought them of her Safety, and a young Ma|&s;ter, they were quite ec&s;tatick, &s;he &s;ays, in their Joy, and not a dry Eye among them, &s;haking Hands, and congratulating one another, Men and Maids: Which mu&s;t make it one of the mo&s;t affecting Sights that can be imagin'd.

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My honoured Papa and Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have nothing but Joy and Fe&s;tivity in this Hou&s;e; and it would be endle&s;s to tell you the Congratulations the happy Family receives every Day, from Tenants and Friends. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> you know, was always deem'd one of the kinde&s;t Landlords in <HI>England</HI>; and his Tenants are &s;o overjoy'd, at the happy Event which has given them a young Land|lord of his Name, (for all tho&s;e who live in that large Part of the E&s;tate, which came by Lady <HI>B.</HI> his Mother, were much afraid of having any of Sir <HI>Jacob Swynford</HI>'s Family for their Landlord, who, they &s;ay, are all made up of Pride and Cruelty, and would have racked them to Death) that they had a voluntary Meeting of about Twenty of the princi|pal of them, to rejoice on the Occa&s;ion, and it was unanimou&s;ly agreed to make a Pre&s;ent of a Piece of gilt Plate to &s;erve as a Ba&s;on for the Chri&s;tening, to the Value of One hundred Guineas; on which is to be ingraven the following In&s;cription:
<Q><P>In Acknowlegement of the Humanity and Gene|ro&s;ity of the Be&s;t of Landlords, and as a Token of his Tenants Joy on the happy Birth of a Son and Heir, who will, it is hoped, inherit his Fa|ther's Genero&s;ity, and his Mother's Virtues, this Piece of Plate, is, with all due Gratitude, pre|&s;ented, as a Chri&s;tening Ba&s;on to all the Chil|dren that &s;hall proceed from &s;uch worthy Pa|rents,
<PB N="142" REF="143">
and their De&s;cendants, to the End of Time,</P>
<P>By the obliged and joyful Tenants of the mater|nal E&s;tate in <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> the Initials of who&s;e Names are under-ingra|ven; <HI>viz.</HI>&mdash;</P></Q></P>
<P>Then are to follow the fir&s;t Letters of each Per|&s;ons Chri&s;tian and Surname.&mdash;</P>
<P>What an Honour is this to a Landlord! In my Opinion far, very far, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the <HI>mi&s;-nomer'd</HI> Free-gifts that we read of in &s;ome Kingdoms on extraordinary Occa&s;ions, &s;ome of them like this! For here it is all truly &s;pontaneous&mdash;A Free Gift <HI>indeed</HI>; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> took it very kindly, and has put off the Chri&s;tening for a Week, to give Time for its being completed and in&s;cribed as above.</P>
<P>Such good Tenants, &s;uch a good Wife, &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings from Heaven following him, nobody, I tell Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has &s;o much Incouragement to be good, as he has; and if hereafter he &s;hould &s;werve, he would not have the lea&s;t Excu&s;e, and would be the ungratefulle&s;t Man breathing.</P>
<P>The Earl and Counte&s;s of <HI>C</HI>&mdash;, and Lord and Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> are here, to &s;tand in Per&s;on at the Chri&s;tening; and you cannot conceive how greatly my Lady <HI>Davers</HI> is tran&s;ported with Joy, to have a Son and Heir to the E&s;tate: She is, every Hour almo&s;t, thanking her dear Si&s;ter for him; and reads in the Child all the great Qualities &s;he forms to her|&s;elf in him. 'Tis, indeed, a charming Boy, and has a great deal (if one may judge of a Child &s;o very young) of his Father's manly A&s;pect. The dear Lady her&s;elf is &s;till but weak; but the Joy of all around her, and her Spou&s;e's Tenderne&s;s and Polite|ne&s;s, give her chearful and free Spirits, and &s;he is all Serenity, Ea&s;e, and Thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144">Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> as &s;oon as the Danger was over, asked me for her Letter with the black Seal. I had been very earne&s;t to get it from Mr. <HI>B.</HI> but to no Pur|po&s;e: So I was forced to tell her who had it. She &s;aid, but very compo&s;edly, &s;he was &s;orry for it, and hop'd he had not open'd it.</P>
<P>He came into her Chamber &s;oon after, and I demanded it before her. He &s;aid, he had de&s;igned to ask her Leave to break the Seal, which he had not yet done; nor would, without her Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee nothing in it, Sir, &s;aid the dear Lady, but a grateful Heart, a faithful Love, and my Prayers, that God will be as good to You, as you have been to Me.</P>
<P>Will you give me Leave, my Dear, &s;aid he, to break the Seal? If you do, Sir, let it not be in my Pre&s;ence; but it is too &s;erious. Not, my Dear, now the Apprehen&s;ion is &s;o happily over: It may now add to my Joy and my Thankfulne&s;s on that Account. Then do as you plea&s;e, Sir: But I had rather you would not.</P>
<P>Then here it is, Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>; I had it from you: It was put into your Hands; and there I place it again. That's &s;omething like, &s;aid I, con&s;idering the Gentleman. Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> I hope we &s;hall bring him into good Order between us in time.</P>
<P>So I return'd it to the dear Writer; who lifted up her Eyes, and her Lips moving, &s;hew'd a thank|ful Ejaculation, that &s;he was &s;pared to receive it back again; and put it into her Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I related to Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> when &s;he came, this Circum&s;tance; and &s;he, I believe, has got Leave to take it with her. She is very proud of all Opportu|nities now of ju&s;tifying her Brother's Choice, and doing Honour to his Spou&s;e, with Lady <HI>Betty C.</HI> who is her great Favourite, and who delights to read Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s Letters.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145">You de&s;ire to know, my honoured Papa, how Mr. <HI>B.</HI> pa&s;&s;es his Time, and whether it be in his Lady's Chamber? No, indeed! Catch Gentlemen, the be&s;t of them, in too great a Complai&s;ance that way, if you can. What then, does he pa&s;s his Time with me, you are plea&s;ed to ask? What a Di&s;advan|tage a Man lies under, who has been once a Rake! But I am &s;o generally with Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> that when I tell you, Sir, that his Vi&s;its to her are pretty much po|lite Form, I believe I an&s;wer all you mean by your Que&s;tions; and e&s;pecially when I remind you, Sir, thai Lady and Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> and the Earl and Coun|te&s;s, and your unworthy Daughter, are at Dinner and Supper-time always together; for Mrs. <HI>Andrews,</HI> who is not yet gone back to <HI>Kent,</HI> breakfa&s;ts, dines, and &s;ups with her beloved Daughter, and is hardly ever out of her Room.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and the Earl, and Lord <HI>Da|vers,</HI> give pretty con&s;tant Application to the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of Parliament; and, now-and-then, &s;up abroad&mdash; So, Sir, we are all upon Honour; and I could wi&s;h, (only that your Plea&s;antry always gives me Joy, as it is a Token, that you have your much-de&s;ired Health and Freedom of Spirits) that, even in Je&s;t, my <HI>Mamma</HI>'s Daughter might pa&s;s unque&s;tioned.</P>
<P>But I know why you do it: It is only to put me out of Heart to ask to &s;tay longer. Yet I wi&s;h&mdash; But I know you won't permit me to go thro' the whole Winter here&mdash;Will my dear Papa grant it, do you think, my honoured Mamma, if you were to lay the highe&s;t Obligation upon your dutiful Daughter, and petition for me? And &s;hould you care to try?</P>
<P>I dare not hope it my&s;elf, you &s;ee, Madam: But when one &s;ees a Gentleman here, who denies his Lady nothing that &s;he asks, it makes one be ready
<PB N="145" REF="146">
to wi&s;h, methinks, that Lady <HI>Darnford</HI> was as happy in that Particular as Lady <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Your</HI> Indulgence, for this Winter, this <HI>one</HI> Winter, or, rather, this &s;mall <HI>Remainder</HI> of Winter, I make not &s;o much doubt of, you &s;ee, Madam. I know you'll call me a bold Girl; but then you always, when you do, conde&s;cend to grant my Reque&s;t: And I will be as good as ever I can afterwards. I will fetch up all the lo&s;t Time; ri&s;e an Hour &s;ooner in the Morning, go to-bed an Hour &s;ooner at Night; flower my Papa any thing he plea&s;es; read him to &s;leep, when he plea&s;es; put his Gout into good Hu|mour, when it will be &s;oothed&mdash;And Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> will, to crown all, come down with me, by Permi&s;&s;ion of her &s;overeign Lord, who will attend her, you may be &s;ure; and will not <HI>all</HI> this do, to procure me a Month or two more?&mdash;If it won't, why then, I will thank you for your pa&s;t Indulgence, and, with all Duty and Chearfulne&s;s, bid Adieu to this dear <HI>London,</HI> this dearer Family, and attend a <HI>&s;till</HI> dearer Papa and Mamma; who&s;e dutiful Daughter I will ever be, whil&s;t</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. To the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My honoured Papa and Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received your joint Commands, and int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd to &s;et out on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> next Week. I hope I &s;hall find my Papa in better Health than he is at pre&s;ent, and in better Humour too; for I am very &s;orry he is di&s;plea&s;ed with my petitioning for a little longer Time in <HI>London.</HI> It is very &s;evere to impute
<PB N="146" REF="147">
to me Want of Duty and Affection to you both, which would, if de&s;erved, make me very unworthy of your Indulgence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and his dear Lady are re&s;olved to accom|pany me in their Coach and Six, till your Chariot meets me, if you will be plea&s;ed to permit it &s;o to do; and even &s;et me down at your Gate, if it do not; but he vows, that he will not alight at your Hou&s;e, nor let his Lady neither. But I &s;ay, that this is a mi&s;placed Re&s;entment, becau&s;e I ought to think it a Favour, that you have indulg'd me &s;o much as you have. And yet even this is likewi&s;e a Favour on <HI>their</HI> Side to me, becau&s;e it is an In&s;tance of their Fondne&s;s for your unworthy Daughter's Company.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> is, if po&s;&s;ible, more lovely &s;ince her Ly|ing-in, than before. She has &s;o much Delight in her Nur&s;ery, that I fear it will take her off from her Pen, which will be a great Lo&s;s to all whom &s;he u&s;ed to oblige with her Corre&s;pondence. Indeed, this new Object of her Care is a charming Child; and &s;he is exceedingly plea&s;ed with her Nur&s;e;&mdash;for &s;he is not permitted, as &s;he very much de&s;ired, to perform that Office her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She makes a great Proficiency in the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Languages; and well &s;he may; for &s;he has the be&s;t Schoolma&s;ter in the World, and one whom &s;he loves better than Lady ever loved a Tutor. He is lofty, and won't be di&s;puted with; but I never &s;aw a more polite and tender Husband, for all that; and well may a Lady, ble&s;s'd as &s;he is, bear with a little Imperiou&s;ne&s;s &s;ometimes; which, however, &s;he nips in the Bud, by her Sweetne&s;s of Temper, and ready Compliance. But then he is a Man of Sen&s;e; and a Lady need be the le&s;s concern'd to yield a Point to a Man of Sen&s;e, and of Genero&s;ity, as he is: Who is incapable of treating her the wor&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="148">
for her Re&s;ignation and Complacency. Whenever I marry, it &s;hall be to a Man of Sen&s;e, and a gene|rous Man, again&s;t the World; for &s;uch an one can|not treat a Woman ill; as Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> often ob&s;erves.</P>
<P>We had a &s;plendid Chri&s;tening, and exceedingly well order'd, and every body was highly delighted at it. The Quality Go&s;&s;ips went away but on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI>; and my Lady <HI>Davers</HI> took Leave of her charming Si&s;ter, with all the Ble&s;&s;ings, and all the Kindne&s;s, and affectionate Fondne&s;s to her, that could be ex|pre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Andrews,</HI> that worthy old Man, came up to &s;ee his Grand&s;on Ye&s;terday, and in order to attend his Wife down. You would never have forgotten the good Man's Behaviour (had you &s;een it) to his Daughter, and to the charming Child: I wi&s;h I could de&s;cribe it to you; but I am apt to think Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> will take notice of it to Lady <HI>Davers</HI>; and if &s;he enters into the De&s;cription of it while I &s;tay, I will beg a Copy of it, to bring down with me; becau&s;e I know you were pleas'd with the &s;en&s;ible, plain, good Man, and his Ways, when at the Hall in your Neighbourhood,</P>
<P>The Child is named <HI>William,</HI> that I &s;hould have told you; but I write without any manner of Con|nection, ju&s;t as things come uppermo&s;t: But don't, my dear Papa, con&s;true this too as an In&s;tance of Di&s;re&s;pect. I wi&s;h you was not &s;o angry with me; it makes me almo&s;t afraid to &s;ee you!&mdash;As I &s;aid, I &s;hall &s;et out next <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> in Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Coach and Six; and as we &s;hall keep the main Road all the Way, I &s;hall &s;ee, by my being met, how I am to be received, or whether pardon'd or not. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, he will take me back again, if my dear Papa frown at me ever &s;o little, and he will not deliver me up into any other Hands but his neither.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="149">We have been at &s;everal Plays, and at the Opera divers times; for we make the be&s;t of our Time, as it is &s;o &s;hort; and we fear'd how it would be; tho' I hoped I &s;hould not have Anger neither. Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> is taken up with writing, between whiles, Remarks upon the Plays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;he &s;ees, in a little Book, for Lady <HI>Davers.</HI> She &s;ent that Lady her Re|marks upon one or two, with which &s;he is &s;o well plea&s;ed, that &s;he will not let even her Nur&s;ery pa&s;s for an Excu&s;e from writing on upon tho&s;e Subjects; and this will &s;o ingro&s;s the dear Lady's Pen, that I &s;hall not be favour'd &s;o much as I u&s;ed to be; but Lady <HI>Davers</HI> promi&s;es me to lend me the Book, when &s;he has read it; &s;o that will be &s;ome Sati&s;|faction.</P>
<P>I &s;ee but one thing that can po&s;&s;ibly happen to di&s;turb the Felicity of this charming Couple; and that I will mention, in Confidence. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> and my&s;elf, were at the Ma&s;querade, before &s;he lay-in: There was a Lady greatly taken with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> She was in a Nun's Habit, and followed him where-ever he went; and Mr. <HI>Turner,</HI> a Gen|tleman of one of the Inns of Court, who vi&s;its Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ometimes, and is an old Acquaintance of his, tells me by the Bye, that the Lady took an Op|portunity to unmask to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> Mr. <HI>Turner</HI> has &s;ince found &s;he is the young Counte&s;s Dowager of &mdash;, a fine Lady; but not the mo&s;t prudent in her Conduct of late, &s;ince her Widowhood. And he has &s;ince di&s;covered, as he &s;ays, that a Letter or two has pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and that Lady, if not more.</P>
<P>Now Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> with all her Perfections, has, as &s;he owns, a little Spice of Jealou&s;y; and &s;hould &s;he be once alarm'd, I tremble for the Con&s;equences to both their Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">It is my Opinion, that if ever any thing makes a Mi&s;under&s;tanding between them, it will be from &s;ome &s;uch Quarter as this. But 'tis a thou&s;and pities it &s;hould. And I hope, as to the actual Corre&s;pon|dence begun, Mr. <HI>Turner</HI> is mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But be it as it will, I would not for the World, the fir&s;t Hints of this Matter &s;hould come from me. &mdash;Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is a very enterpri&s;ing and gallant Gentleman, is a fine Figure of a Man, and very genteel, and I don't wonder a Lady may like him. But be &s;eems &s;o pleas'd, &s;o &s;atisfy'd with his Lady, and carries it to her with &s;o much Tenderne&s;s and Affection, that I hope her Merit, and this his Affection for her, will &s;ecure his conjugal Fidelity.</P>
<P>If it prove otherwi&s;e, and &s;he di&s;covers it, I know no one that would be more mi&s;erable than Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> as well from Motives of Piety and Virtue, as from the exce&s;&s;ive Love &s;he bears him.&mdash;But I hope for better Things, for both their &s;akes.&mdash;</P>
<P>My humble Thanks for all your Indulgences to me, with Hopes, that you will not, my dear Papa and Mamma, hold your Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t me, when I throw my&s;elf at your Feet, as I now &s;oon hope to do, conclude me</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. From Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> to Lady <HI>DAVERS.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are ju&s;t return'd from accompanying the worthy Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> as far as <HI>Bedford,</HI> in her Way home; where her Papa and Mamma met
<PB N="150" REF="151">
her in a Coach and Four. Sir <HI>Simon</HI> put on his plea&s;ant Airs, and &s;chooled Mr. <HI>B.</HI> for per&s;uading his Daughter to &s;tay &s;o long from him; <HI>me</HI> for put|ting her upon asking to &s;tay longer; and <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> for being per&s;uaded by us.</P>
<P>I think he is wor&s;e than ever, in his way of Talk, and for my Rebukes to him; for he ran on a deal of Stuff about me, and my late Circum&s;tance; and would have it, that I am &s;o much improv'd, that I ought to make a Court'&s;y to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> once an Hour. He &s;aid, when I was angry at him, and his Lady blam'd him, that it was all pure Revenge for my Letter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. III. <HI>p.</HI> 106&mdash;113.</NOTE>, and for keeping Mi&s;s &s;o long from him.</P>
<P>We tarry'd two Days together at <HI>Bedford</HI>; for we knew not how to part; and then we took a mo&s;t affectionate Leave of each other.</P>
<P>We &s;truck out of the Road a little, to make a Vi&s;it to the dear Hou&s;e, where we tarry'd one Night; and next Morning, before any body could come to congratulate us, (de&s;igning to be <HI>incog.</HI>) we pro|ceeded on our Journey to <HI>London,</HI> and found my deare&s;t, dear Boy, in charming Health.</P>
<P>What a new Plea&s;ure has God Almighty's Good|ne&s;s be&s;tow'd upon me; which, after every little Ab|&s;ence, ri&s;es upon me, in a true maternal Tenderne&s;s, every Step I move toward the dear little Ble&s;&s;ing!&mdash; Yet, &s;ometimes, I think your dear Brother is not &s;o fond of him, as I wi&s;h him to be. He &s;ays, 'tis time enough for him to mind him, when he can return his Notice, and be grateful! &mdash; A negligent Word, i'n't it, Madam?&mdash; Con&s;idering&mdash;</P>
<P>My dear Father came to Town, to accompany my good Mother down to <HI>Kent,</HI> and they &s;et out three or four Days after your Lady&s;hip left us. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the Joy with which his
<PB N="151" REF="152">
worthy Heart overflow'd, when he congratulated us on the happy Event. And as he had been appre|hen&s;ive for his Daughter's Safety, judge, my Lady, what his Tran&s;ports mu&s;t be, to &s;ee us all &s;afe and well, and happy, and a Son given to dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> by his greatly honoured Daughter.</P>
<P>I was in the Nur&s;ery when he came. So was my Mother. Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> al&s;o was there. And Mr. <HI>B.</HI> who was in his Clo&s;et at his Arrival, after having received his mo&s;t re&s;pectful Congratulations him|&s;elf, brought him up (tho' he has not been there &s;ince: indeed he han't!): <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid the dear Gen|tleman! &s;ee who's here.</P>
<P>I &s;prung to him, and kneeled for his kind Ble&s;&s;ing: O my Father! &s;aid I, &s;ee! pointing to the dear Baby at the Nur&s;e's Brea&s;t, how God Almighty has an|&s;wer'd all our Prayers!</P>
<P>He dropp'd down on his reverend Knees by me, cla&s;ping me in his indulgent Arms: O my Daugh|ter!&mdash;O my ble&s;&s;ed Daughter!&mdash;And do I once more &s;ee you! And &s;ee you &s;afe and well!&mdash;I do! I do!&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed be thy Name, O gracious GOD, for the&s;e thy Mercies!</P>
<P>While we were thus joined, happy Father, and happy Daughter, in one Thank&s;giving Prayer, the &s;weet Baby having fallen a&s;leep, the Nur&s;e had put it into the Cradle; and when my Father ro&s;e from me, he went to my Mother, God ble&s;s my dear <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;aid he: I long'd to &s;ee you, after this Sepa|ration. Here's Joy! Here's Plea&s;ure! O how happy are we! And taking her Hand, he kneeled down on one Side the Cradle, and my Mother on the other, both looking at the dear Baby, with Eyes running over; and, Hand in Hand, he prayed, in the mo&s;t fervent manner, for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon the dear Infant; and that God Almighty would make him an Honour to his Father's Family, and to his Mother's Virtue
<PB N="152" REF="153">
that was his kind Word,) and that, in the Words of Scripture, <HI>he might grow on, and be in Favour both with the Lord, and with Men!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>They both ro&s;e, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> taking my Hand, and Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s; (your Lady&s;hip may gue&s;s how <HI>we</HI> were moved! for Mi&s;s is a &s;weet-natur'd Lady, you know, Madam) My dear <HI>Pamela!</HI> How the&s;e kind, the&s;e grateful Hearts affect me!&mdash; Do you often, my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> &s;ee Scenes wrought up by the Poets to this moving Height?&mdash; Here we behold and admire that noble Simplicity, in which Nature always triumphs over her Hand-maid Art!&mdash; And which makes a Scene of Joy as affecting to a noble Mind, as that of the deepe&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s! El&s;e, how could it di&s;play its Force thus &s;weetly on your lovely Cheek! And he &s;aluted the dear Mi&s;s, and me too!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has ju&s;t put into my Hands Mr. <HI>Lockes</HI>'s Treati&s;e on Education, and he commands me to give him my Thoughts upon it in Writing. He has a very high Regard for this Author, and tells me, That my Tenderne&s;s for <HI>Billy</HI> will make me think &s;ome of the fir&s;t Advice given in it, a little har&s;h, perhaps; but altho' he has not read it through, only having dipp'd into it here and there, he believes, from the Name of the Author, I cannot have a better Di|rectory: And my Opinion of it, after I have well con&s;idered it, will inform him, he &s;ays, of my own Capacity and Prudence, and how far he may rely upon both in the Point of a <HI>fir&s;t Education.</HI></P>
<P>I ask'd, If I might not be excus'd Writing, only making my Ob&s;ervations here and there, to him&s;elf, as I found Occa&s;ion? But he &s;ays, I &s;hall my&s;elf better con&s;ider it, and be more a Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Subject, and he &s;hall the better attend to my Rea|&s;onings, when they are put into Writing: And &s;urely, my Dear, &s;aid he, you may, in &s;uch an important Point as this, as well oblige <HI>me</HI> with a little of your Penman&s;hip, as our other dear Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154">After this, your Lady&s;hip will judge, I had not another Word to &s;ay. He cuts one to the Heart, when he &s;peaks &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>I have look'd a little into it. It is a Book quite accommodated to my Ca&s;e, being written to a Gentle-Gentleman, the Author's Friend, for the Regulation of his Conduct towards his Children. But how &s;hall I do, Madam, if in &s;uch a fam'd and renowned Author, I &s;ee already &s;ome few things, that I think want clear|ing up? Won't it look like intolerable Vanity, in &s;uch a one as me, to find fault with &s;uch a Genius as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s?</P>
<P>But I will con&s;ider of the Matter thoroughly, before I &s;et Pen to Paper; for, altho' he writes in a very familiar and intelligible Style, perhaps I may not under&s;tand him at once reading.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t, on this Occa&s;ion, give your Lady&s;hip the Particulars of a &s;hort Conver&s;ation between your dear Brother and me; which, however, perhaps, will not be to my Advantage, becau&s;e it will &s;hew you what a teizing Body I can be, if I am indulged.&mdash; But Mr. <HI>B.</HI> will not &s;poil me neither in that way: No fear of that, I dare &s;ay!&mdash; Your Lady&s;hip will &s;ee this in the very Dialogue I &s;hall give you.</P>
<P>Thus it was. I had been reading in Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Book, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> asked me, How I lik'd it? Ex|ceedingly well, Sir. But I have a Propo&s;al to make, which, if you will be plea&s;ed to comply with, will give me a charming Opportunity of under&s;tanding Mr. <HI>Locke.</HI></P>
<P>What is your Propo&s;al, my Dear? I &s;ee it is &s;ome very particular one, by that &s;weet Earne&s;tne&s;s in your Look.</P>
<P>Why &s;o it is, reply'd I: And I mu&s;t know, whe|ther you are in a high good Humour with me, be|fore I make it. I think you look grave upon me; and my Propo&s;al will not then do, I'm &s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">You have all the amu&s;ing Ways of your Sex, my dear <HI>Pamela.</HI> But tell me what you would &s;ay: You know I don't love Su&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>May be you're bu&s;y, Sir. Perhaps I break in upon you. I believe you were going into your Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>True Woman!&mdash; &s;aid he; how you love to put one upon the Tenters! Yet, my Life for yours, by your Parade, what I ju&s;t now thought important, is &s;ome pretty Trifle.&mdash; Speak it at once, or I'll be angry with you; and tapp'd my Cheek.</P>
<P>Well, I wi&s;h I had not come ju&s;t now!&mdash;I &s;ee you are not in a quite good Humour enough for my Propo&s;al.&mdash; So, pray, Sir, excu&s;e me, till To|morrow.</P>
<P>He took my Hand, and led me to his Clo&s;et, calling me his pretty Impertinent; and then urging me, I &s;aid&mdash; You know, Sir, I have not been us'd to the Company of Children. Your dear <HI>Billy</HI> will not make me fit, for a long time, to judge of any Part of Education. I can learn of the charming Boy nothing but the Baby Conduct: But now, if you would permit me to take into the Hou&s;e &s;ome little Ma&s;ter of three or four Years old, or Mi&s;s of five or &s;ix, I &s;hould watch over all their little Ways; and now reading a Chapter in the <HI>Child,</HI> and now a Chapter in <HI>the Book,</HI> I &s;hall be inabled to look for|ward, and with Advantage, into the Subject; and to go thro' all the Parts of Education tolerably, for one of my Capacity; for, Sir, I can, by my own Defects, and what I have wi&s;hed to mend, know how to judge of, and &s;upply that Part of Life, which carries one up to Eleven or Twelve Years of Age, which was mine, when my Lady took me.</P>
<P>A pretty Thought, <HI>Pamela!</HI> But tell me, Who will part with their Child, think you? Would <HI>you</HI> do it, if it were your own Ca&s;e, altho' you were ever &s;o
<PB N="155" REF="156">
well a&s;&s;ur'd of the Advantages your Little-one would reap by it?&mdash; For, don't you con&s;ider, my Dear, that the Child ought to be wholly &s;ubjected to your Authority? That its Father or Mother ought &s;eldom to &s;ee it; becau&s;e it &s;hould think it&s;elf ab&s;olutely de|pendent upon you?&mdash; And where, my Dear, will you meet with Parents &s;o re&s;ign'd?&mdash; Be&s;ides, one would have the Child de&s;cended of genteel Parents, and not &s;uch as could do nothing for it; otherwi&s;e the Turn of Mind and Education you would give it, might do it more Harm than Good.</P>
<P>All this is true, Sir, very true. But would you have no other Objection, if one could find a gen|teelly de&s;cended young Ma&s;ter? And would you join to per&s;uade his Papa to give me up this Power, only from three Months to three Months, as I liked, and the Child liked, and as the Papa approved of my Proceedings?</P>
<P>This is &s;o rea&s;onable, with the&s;e la&s;t Conditions <HI>Pamela,</HI> that I &s;hould be plea&s;ed with your Notion, if it could be put in Practice, becau&s;e the Child would be benefited by your In&s;truction, and you would be improved in an Art, that I could wi&s;h to &s;ee you an Adept in.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, Sir, you had rather it were a Mi&s;s, than a Ma&s;ter!</P>
<P>I had, my Dear, if a Mi&s;s could be found, who&s;e Parents would give her up to you: But I &s;uppo&s;e you have &s;ome Ma&s;ter in your Head, by your put|ing it upon that Sex at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ee, Sir, You &s;ay you are in a good Hu|mour! Let me &s;ee, if you be!&mdash; Looking boldly in his Face.</P>
<P>He &s;aluted me: What now would the pretty Fool be at?</P>
<P>Only, Sir, that you have nothing to do, but to &s;peak the Word, and there is a Mi&s;s who&s;e Papa, and
<PB N="156" REF="157">
Mamma too, I am &s;ure, would con&s;ent to give up to me, for my own In&s;truction, as well as for her &s;ake; and if, to &s;peak in the Scripture Phra&s;e, I have found <HI>Grace in your Sight,</HI> kind Sir, &s;peak this Word to the dear Mi&s;s's Papa.</P>
<P>And have you thus come over with me, <HI>Pamela!</HI>&mdash; Go, I am half angry with you, for leading me on in this manner again&s;t my&s;elf. This looks &s;o artful, that I won't love you!&mdash; Dear Sir!&mdash; And dear Madam! too! Begone, I &s;ay!&mdash; You have &s;urpris'd me by Art, when your Talent is Nature, and you &s;hould keep to that!</P>
<P>I was &s;adly balk'd and vex'd, and had neither Power to go nor &s;tay!&mdash; At la&s;t, &s;eeing I had put him into a kind of Flutter, as now he had put me, I moved my unwilling Feet towards the Door.&mdash; He took a Turn about the Clo&s;et mean time.&mdash; Yet &s;tay, &s;aid he, there is &s;omething &s;o generous in your Art, that, on Recollection, I cannot part with you.</P>
<P>He took Notice of the &s;tarting Tear&mdash; I am to blame!&mdash; You had &s;urpris'd me &s;o, that my ha&s;ty Temper got the better of my Con&s;ideration. Let me ki&s;s away this pearly Fugitive. Forgive me, my deare&s;t Love!

<P>But &s;ay, my <HI>Pamela</HI>; can you forgive my Ha&s;ti|ne&s;s?&mdash; Can I, Sir!

<P>We have heard &s;ome idle Rumours here, as if you were a little unea&s;y of late; and having not had a Letter from you for this Fortnight pa&s;t, it makes me write, to ask, How you all do? and whether you expected an An&s;wer from me to your la&s;t?</P>

My Lord is re&s;olv'd to put his Proxy into another Hand, and intends, I be|lieve, to take my Brother's Advice in it. Both the Earl and his Lord&s;hip are highly pleas'd with my Brother's moderate and independent Principles. He has got great Credit among all unprejudic'd Men, by the Part he acted throughout the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, in which he has &s;hewn, that he would no more join to di&s;tre&s;s and clog the Wheels of Government, by an unrea&s;onable Oppo&s;ition, than he would do the dirty Work of any Admini&s;tration. As he has &s;o noble a Fortune, and wants nothing of any Body, he would be doubly to blame, to take any other Part than that of his Country, in which he has &s;o great a Stake.</P>
<P>May he act <HI>out</HI> of the Hou&s;e, and <HI>in</HI> the Hou&s;e, with equal Honour; and he will be his Country's Pride, and your Pride, and mine too! Which is the Wi&s;h of</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> cannot be unpolite; but he is cold, and a little cro&s;s, and &s;hort in his Speeches to me.

Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> from whom I &s;eldom hide any thing, as &s;he is on the Spot with me, hears not my Complainings, nor my Unea&s;ine&s;s; for I would not le&s;&s;en the dear Gentleman.

<P>The poor unhappy Lady, God forgive her! is to be pity'd: She loves him, and having &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions, and being unus'd to be controul'd, is lo&s;t to a Sen&s;e of Honour and Ju&s;tice; poor, poor Lady! &mdash; O the&s;e wicked Ma&s;querades!

<P>I am all Patience in Appearance, all Unea&s;ine&s;s in Reality. I did not think I could, e&s;pecially in <HI>this</HI> Point, this mo&s;t <HI>affecting</HI> Point, be &s;uch an Hypocrite.

Lady&s;hip, in one of my former <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this <HI>Vol.</HI> p. <HI>30.</HI></NOTE>, that two Gentle|men, brought up to the Law, but above the Practice of it, tho', I doubt, not above Practices le&s;s honour|able, had vi&s;ited us, on coming to Town.</P>
<P>They have been often here &s;ince, Mr. <HI>Turner</HI> particularly; and &s;ometimes by him&s;elf, when Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has happen'd to be out; and he it was, as I gue&s;s'd, that gave me, at the wicked Ma&s;querade, the Caution of looking after my <HI>Mu&s;idorus</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>p.</HI> 116.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I did not like their Vi&s;its, and <HI>his</HI> much le&s;s: For he &s;eem'd to me a Man of an intriguing Spirit. But about Three Weeks ago, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;etting out upon a Party of Plea&s;ure to <HI>Oxford,</HI> he came, and pre|tending great Bu&s;ine&s;s with me, and I happening to be at Breakfa&s;t in the Parlour, only <HI>Polly</HI> attending me, admitted him to drink a Di&s;h of Chocolate with me. And when <HI>Polly</HI> had &s;tept down, he told me, after many Apologies, that he had di&s;cover'd who the Nun was at the Ma&s;querade, that had ingag'd Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aid, It was very indifferent to me, who the Lady was.</P>
<P>He reply'd, (making &s;till more Apologies, and pretending great Reluctance to &s;peak out) That it was no le&s;s a Lady than the young Counte&s;s Dow|ager of &mdash;, a Lady noted for her Wit and her Beauty; but of a gay Character, tho' he believ'd not yet culpable.</P>
<P>I was alarm'd; but would not let him &s;ee it; and he run into the Topick of the Inju&s;tice of marry'd Gentlemen, who had virtuous Wives, and gave them&s;elves up to Intrigues of this kind.</P>
<P>I remember'd &s;ome of Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s Le&s;&s;ons formerly, of which I once gave your Lady&s;hip a Tran&s;cript<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 318.</NOTE>, particularly, that of drawing a kind Veil over his
<PB N="166" REF="167">
Faults, and extenuating tho&s;e I could not Hide; and &s;till more particularly that Caution, that if ever Rakes attempted a marry'd Lady, their Incourage|ment proceeded from the Slights and Contempts with which they endeavour'd to in&s;pire her again&s;t her Husband; and I told Mr. <HI>Turner,</HI> That I was &s;o well &s;atisfy'd in Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Affection for me, and his well-known Honour, that I could not think my|&s;elf obliged to any Gentleman, who &s;hould endea|vour to give me a le&s;s Opinion of either, than I ought to have.</P>
<P>He then bluntly told me, that the very Party Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was upon, was with the Counte&s;s for one, and the Lord &mdash;, who had marry'd her Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I was glad he was in &s;uch good Company, and wi&s;hed him all manner of Plea&s;ure in it.</P>
<P>He hoped, he &s;aid, he might tru&s;t to my Di&s;cre|tion, that I would not let Mr. <HI>B.</HI> know from whom I had the Information: That, indeed, his Motive was Self-intere&s;t in mentioning it to me; for that he had pre&s;um'd to make &s;ome Overtures of an honour|able Nature to the Counte&s;s, in his own Behalf; which had been rejected &s;ince that Ma&s;querade Night: And that he hoped the prudent U&s;e I would make of the Intimation, might, &s;ome-how, be a Means to break off that Corre&s;pondence, before it was attended with bad Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I told him, coldly, tho' it &s;tung me to the Heart, That I &s;hould not interfere in the Matter at all: That I was fully a&s;&s;ur'd of Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Honour; and was &s;orry, he, Mr. <HI>Turner,</HI> had &s;o bad an Opinion of a Lady, for whom he profe&s;&s;ed &s;o high a Con|&s;ideration. And ri&s;ing up, Will you excu&s;e me, Sir, that I cannot attend at all to &s;uch a Subject as this; and think I ought not; and &s;o mu&s;t withdraw?</P>
<P>Only, Madam, one Word. He offer'd to take my Hand, but I would not permit it &mdash; And then he
<PB N="167" REF="168">
&s;wore a great Oath, that he had told me his true and his only Motive: And that Letters had pa&s;&s;ed between the Counte&s;s and Mr. <HI>B.</HI>; adding, That one Day I would blame my&s;elf for not endeavouring to &s;tifle a Flame, that might now perhaps be kept under; but which, if it got Head, would be of more fatal Con&s;equence to my Repo&s;e than I at pre&s;ent imagin'd. &mdash; But, &s;aid he, I beg you'll keep it in your own Brea&s;t; el&s;e it may, from two &s;uch ha&s;ty Spirits, as his and mine, po&s;&s;ibly be attended with &s;till wor&s;e Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I will never, Sir, enter into a Subject, that is not proper to be communicated, every Tittle of it, to Mr. <HI>B.</HI>; and this mu&s;t be my Excu&s;e for withdraw|ing. And away I went from him.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip will judge with how unea&s;y an Heart; which became more &s;o, when I &s;at down to reflect upon what he had told me. But I was re&s;olved to give it as little Credit as I could, or that any thing would come of it, till Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s own Behaviour &s;hould convince me, to my Affliction, that I had &s;ome Rea&s;on to be alarm'd: So I open'd not my Lips about it to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> or any body.</P>
<P>At Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Return, I receiv'd him in my u&s;ual affectionate and unre&s;erved Manner; and he behav'd him&s;elf with as great Goodne&s;s and Kindne&s;s to me as u&s;ual; or, at lea&s;t, with &s;o little Difference, that had not the Gentleman's Officiou&s;ne&s;s made me more watchful, I &s;hould not have perceived it.</P>
<P>But, next Day, a Letter was brought by a Foot|man for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> He was out: So <HI>John</HI> gave it to me. The Super&s;cription was a Lady's Writing: The Seal, the Dowager Lady's, with a Coronet. This gave me great Unea&s;ine&s;s: And when Mr. <HI>B.</HI> came in, I &s;aid, Here is a Letter for you, Sir; and from a Lady too!</P>
<P>What then? &mdash; &s;aid he with Quickne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">I was balked, and withdrew. For I &s;aw him turn the Seal about and about, as if he would &s;ee if I had endeavour'd to look into it.</P>
<P>He needed not to have been &s;o afraid; for I would not have done &s;uch a Thing, had I known my Life was to depend upon it.</P>
<P>I went up, and could not help weeping at his quick An&s;wer; yet I did my Endeavour to hide it, when he came up.</P>
<P>Was not my Girl a little inqui&s;itive upon me, ju&s;t now?</P>
<P>I &s;poke plea&s;antly, Sir! &mdash; But you were very quick upon your Girl.</P>
<P>'Tis my Temper, my Dear&mdash;You know I mean nothing. You &s;hould not mind it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not, Sir, if I had been <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to it.</P>
<P>He look'd at me with Sternne&s;s. &mdash; Do you doubt my Honour, Madam?</P>
<P><HI>Madam!</HI> did you &s;ay, Sir! &mdash; I won't take that Word! &mdash; Dear Sir, call it back &mdash; I won't be call'd <HI>Madam!</HI> &mdash; Call me your Girl, your Ru&s;tick, your <HI>Pamela</HI> &mdash; Call me any thing but <HI>Madam!</HI></P>
<P>My Charmer, then, my Life, my Soul; will any of tho&s;e do? and &s;aluted me: But whatever you do, let me not &s;ee, that you have any Doubts of my Honour to you.</P>
<P>The very Mention of the Word, dear Sir, is a Security to me; I want no other; I cannot doubt: But if you &s;peak &s;hort to me, how &s;hall I bear that!</P>
<P>He withdrew, &s;peaking nothing of the Contents of his Letter; as I dare &s;ay he would, had the Subject been &s;uch as he cho&s;e to mention to me.</P>
<P>We being alone, after Supper, I took the Liberty to ask him, Who was of his Party to <HI>Oxford?</HI> He nam'd the Vi&s;counte&s;s &mdash; and her Lord, Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> and his Daughter, Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> and his Lady: And I had a Partner too, my Dear, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre&s;ent you.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">I am much obliged to the Lady, Sir, be &s;he who &s;he would.</P>
<P>Why, my Dear, you are <HI>&s;o</HI> ingag'd in your Nur|&s;ery! Then this was a &s;udden Thing; as, you know, I told you.</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, as long as it was agreeable to you, I had nothing to do, but to be pleas'd with it.</P>
<P>He watched my Eyes, and the Turn of my Countenance&mdash;You look, <HI>Pamela,</HI> as if you'd be glad to return the Lady Thanks in Per&s;on. Shall I ingage her to vi&s;it you? She longs to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>Sir,&mdash;Sir,&mdash;he&s;itated I&mdash;as you plea&s;e &mdash;I can't be&mdash;I can't be&mdash;di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;plea&s;ed!</HI> &mdash; interrupted he; why that Word? And why that He&s;itation in your An&s;wer? You &s;peak very volubly, my Dear, when you're not moved.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, almo&s;t as quick as him&s;elf, Why &s;hould I be moved? What Occa&s;ion is there for it? I hope you have a better Opinion of me than &mdash;</P>
<P>Than what?&mdash;<HI>Pamela</HI>&mdash;What would you &s;ay? I know you're a little jealous Slut. I know you are.</P>
<P>But, dear Sir, why &s;hould you think of imputing Jealou&s;y to me on <HI>this</HI> Score?&mdash;What a Creature mu&s;t I be, if you could not be abroad with a Lady, but I mu&s;t be jealous of you?&mdash;No, Sir, I have Rea&s;on to rely upon your Honour; and I <HI>do</HI> rely upon it; and&mdash;</P>
<P>And what? Why, my Dear, you are giving me A&s;&s;urances, as if you thought the Ca&s;e requir'd it!</P>
<P>Ah! thought I, &s;o it does, I &s;ee too plainly, or apprehend I do; but I dur&s;t not &s;ay &s;o; nor give him any Hint about my Informant; tho' now I was enough confirmed of the Truth of what Mr. <HI>Turner</HI> had told me.</P>
<P>Yet, I re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, not to alter my Conduct. But my frequent Weepings, when by
<PB N="170" REF="171">
my&s;elf, could not be hid as I wi&s;hed; my Eyes not keeping my Heart's Coun&s;el.</P>
<P>And this gives Occa&s;ion to &s;ome of the &s;tern Words which I have mention'd above.</P>
<P>All that he further &s;aid, at this Time, was, with a negligent, yet a determin'd Air&mdash;Well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> don't be doubtful of my Honour. You know how much I love you. But, one Day or other, I &s;hall gratify this Lady's Curio&s;ity, and will bring her to pay you a Vi&s;it, and you &s;hall &s;ee you need not be a&s;ham'd of her Acquaintance!&mdash;Whenever you plea&s;e, Sir, &mdash;was all I car'd to &s;ay farther; for I &s;aw he was upon the Catch, and look'd &s;tedfa&s;tly upon me whenever I mov'd my Lips; and I am not a fini&s;h'd Hypocrite; and he can read the Lines of one's Face, and the Motions of one's Heart, I think.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure mine is a very unea&s;y one. But 'till I reflected and weigh'd well the Matter, it was wor&s;e, and my natural Imperfection of this &s;ort made me &s;ee a Nece&s;&s;ity to be the more watchful over my|&s;elf, and to doubt my own Prudence. And thus I rea&s;on'd when he withdrew:</P>
<P>Here, thought I, I have had a greater Proportion of Happine&s;s, without Alloy, fallen to my Share, than any of my Sex; and I ought to be prepar'd for &s;ome Trials.</P>
<P>'Tis true, this is of the &s;ore&s;t Kind; 'tis wor&s;e than Death it&s;elf to me, who had an Opinion of the dear Gentleman's Reformation, and prided my&s;elf not a little on that Account. So that the Blow is full upon my &s;ore Place. 'Tis on the Side I could be the mo&s;t ea&s;ily penetrated. But <HI>Achilles</HI> could be touched only in his Heel; and if he was to die by an Enemy's Hand, mu&s;t not the Arrow find out that only vulnerable Place? &mdash; My Jealou&s;y is that Place with me, as your Lady&s;hip ob&s;erves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this <HI>Vol.</HI> p. <HI>162.</HI></NOTE>; but is
<PB N="171" REF="172">
&s;eated deeper than the Heel: It is in my <HI>Heart,</HI> and the barbed Dart has found it out, and there it &s;ticks up to the very Feathers.</P>
<P>Yet, thought I, I will take care, that I do not exa&s;perate him by Upbraidings, when I &s;hould try to move him by Patience and Forbearance. For the Breach of <HI>his</HI> Duty cannot warrant the Neglect of <HI>mine.</HI> My Bu&s;ine&s;s is to reclaim, and not to pro|voke. And when, if it plea&s;e God, this Storm &s;hall be over-blown, let me not, by my pre&s;ent Beha|viour, leave any Room for Heart-burnings; but, like a skilful Surgeon, &s;o heal the Wound to the Bottom, tho' the Operation be painful, that it may not fe&s;ter, and break out again with fre&s;h Violence, on future Mi&s;under&s;tandings, if any &s;hall happen.</P>
<P>He is a young Gentleman, has been u&s;ed to have his own Will, thought I. This may be a permitted Stumbling-block in his Way, to make him &s;tand the firmer, when recover'd. The Lady may be unhappy that &s;he cannot conquer her faulty Love. They may both &s;ee their Error, and &s;top &s;hort of Crime. If not, he is a Gentleman of fine Sen&s;e; he may run an undue Length, but may reclaim; and then I &s;hall be <HI>his</HI> Superior, by my pre&s;erved Virtue and Duty, and have it in my Power to forgive the dear Gentleman, and &s;o repay him &s;ome of tho&s;e Obli|gations which I &s;hall never otherwi&s;e have it in my Power to repay;&mdash;nor indeed wi&s;h to have it, in this way, if it plea&s;e God to prevent it.</P>
<P>Then, thought I, how much better is it to be the <HI>&s;uffering</HI> than the <HI>offending</HI> Per&s;on!&mdash;But yet, Madam, to have &s;o fine a Gentleman, who had advanced &s;o far up the Hill of Virtue, to &s;lide back all at once; and (between your Lady&s;hip and me) to have him &s;ink down to the Character he had de&s;pi&s;ed; and, at la&s;t, if his dear Life &s;hould be &s;pared, (as is my hourly Prayer) to have him carry
<PB N="172" REF="173">
his Vices into advanced Years, and become &s;uch a poor Gentleman, as we &s;ee Sir <HI>Simon Darnford,</HI> retaining a Love of his juvenile Follies, even after the Practice has left him; how my Heart &s;hudders at &s;uch a Thought for my Mr. <HI>B.!</HI></P>
<P>Well, but, thought I, let the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, he may perhaps be &s;o good as to permit me to pa&s;s the Remainder of my Days, with my dear <HI>Billy,</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> with my Father and Mother; and &s;o, when I cannot rejoice in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a virtuous Husband, I &s;hall be imploy'd in praying for him, and injoy a two fold Happine&s;s, that of doing my own Duty to my dear Baby,&mdash;and a plea&s;ing Enter|tainment that will be!&mdash;and that of comforting my worthy Parents, and being comforted by them; &mdash; and no &s;mall Con&s;olation this!&mdash;And who knows, but I may be permitted to &s;teal a Vi&s;it now-and-then to dear Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> and be called Si&s;ter, and be deem'd a <HI>faultle&s;s</HI> Si&s;ter too!&mdash;and that will be a fine Thing! But, remember, my dear Lady, that if ever it come to this, I will not bear, that for my &s;ake, you &s;hall, with too much A&s;perity, blame your dear Brother; for I will be ingenious to find Excu&s;es or Extenuations for him; and I will now-and-then, in &s;ome di&s;gui&s;ed Habit, &s;teal the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him, and his happier Counte&s;s; and give him, with a &s;ilent Tear, my Ble&s;&s;ing for the Good I and mine have reaped at his dear Hands.</P>
<P>But, oh! if he takes from me my dear <HI>Billy,</HI> who mu&s;t, after all, be his Heir, and gives him to the cruel Counte&s;s, he will at once bur&s;t a&s;under the Strings of my Heart! For, Oh my happy Rivale&s;s! if you tear from me my Husband, he is in his own Di&s;po&s;al, and I cannot help it: &mdash; Nor can I indeed, if he will give you my <HI>Billy.</HI> But this I am &s;ure of, that my Child and my Life mu&s;t go together!</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">Your Lady&s;hip will think I rave. Indeed I am almo&s;t crazed at times. For the dear Gentleman is &s;o negligent, &s;o cold, &s;o haughty! that I cannot bear it. He &s;ays, ju&s;t now, You are quite alter'd, <HI>Pamela.</HI> I believe I am, Madam. But what can I do! He knows not, that I know &s;o much. I dare not tell him. For he will have me then reveal my Intelli|gencer: And what may be the Ca&s;e between them?</P>
<P>I weep in the Night, when he is a&s;leep; and in the Day, when he is ab&s;ent: And I am happy when I can, unob&s;erv'd, &s;teal this poor Relief. I believe already I have &s;hed as many Tears as would drown my poor Baby. How many more I may have to &s;hed, God only knows! &mdash; For oh! Madam, after all my Fortitude, and my Recollection, to fall from &s;o much Happine&s;s, and &s;o &s;oon, is a trying Thing!</P>
<P>But I will hope &s;till the be&s;t, and re&s;ign to God's Will, and his, and &s;ee how far the dear Gentleman will be permitted to exerci&s;e me. So don't, my good Lady, be over-much concern'd for me&mdash;For you know I am apt to be too apprehen&s;ive!

I pretend 'tis all Fal&s;hood and Malice. Yet Lady <HI>Betty</HI> will have it, that there is more in it than I will own, and that I know my Brother's Wicked|ne&s;s, by my pen&s;ive Looks. She will make a Vow, &s;he &s;ays, never to marry any Man living.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Thou&s;and Thanks for your kind, your truly Si&s;terly Letter and Advice. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is ju&s;t return'd from a Tour to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> I believe, with the Counte&s;s; but am not &s;ure.</P>
<P>Here I am forc'd to leave off&mdash;Let me &s;cratch thro' this la&s;t Surmi&s;e. It &s;eems, &s;he was not with him. This is &s;ome Comfort, however.</P>
<P>He is very kind; and <HI>Billy</HI> not being well, when he came in, my Grief pa&s;&s;ed off without Blame. He has &s;aid a great many kind Things to me: But added, That if I gave my&s;elf &s;o much Unea&s;i|ne&s;s every Time the Child ailed any thing, he would hire the Nur&s;e to over-lay him. Ble&s;s me, Madam! what hard-hearted, what &s;hocking Things are the&s;e Men capable of &s;aying!&mdash;The farthe&s;t from their Hearts, indeed; &s;o they had need!&mdash;For he was as glad of the Child's being better as I could be.</P>
<P>In the Morning he went out in the Chariot for about an Hour, and return'd in a very good Humour, &s;aying twenty agreeable Things to me, which makes me &s;o proud, and &s;o pleas'd!</P>
<P>He is gone out again.</P>
<P>Could I but find this Matter happily conquer'd, for his own Soul's &s;ake!&mdash;But he &s;eems, by what your Lady&s;hip mentions, to have carry'd this Polygamy Point with the Lady.</P>
<P>Can I live with him, Madam,&mdash;Ought I&mdash;if this be the Ca&s;e? I have it under his Hand, that the
<PB N="176" REF="177">
Laws of his Country were &s;ufficient to deter him from this Practice. But oh! he knew not this Counte&s;s then! They &s;ay, &s;he is a fine Woman!&mdash;</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t break off. He is return'd, and coming up. Go into my Bo&s;om, for the pre&s;ent, O Letter dedicated to dear Lady <HI>Davers</HI>&mdash;Come to my Hand, the Play Imployment, &s;o un&s;uited to my pre&s;ent afflicted Mind!&mdash;Here he comes!</P>
<P>O but, Madam, Madam! my Heart is almo&s;t broken!&mdash;Ju&s;t now Mr. <HI>B.</HI> tells me, that the Counte&s;s-Dowager, and the Vi&s;counte&s;s her Si&s;ter, are to be here to &s;ee my <HI>Billy,</HI> and to drink Tea with me, this very Afternoon!</P>
<P>I was all Confu&s;ion, when he told me this. I looked around and around, and upon every thing but him.</P>
<P>Will not my Friends be welcome, <HI>Pamela?</HI> &s;aid he, &s;ternly.</P>
<P>O yes, Sir, very welcome!&mdash;But I have tho&s;e na&s;ty Vapours &s;o, that I wi&s;h I might be excus'd. &mdash;I wi&s;h I might be allow'd to take an Airing in the Chariot for two or three Hours; for I &s;hall not be fit to be &s;een by &s;uch&mdash;Ladies&mdash;&s;aid I, half out of Breath.</P>
<P>You'll be fit to be &s;een by nobody, my Dear, if you go on thus.&mdash;But, do as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>He was going, and I took his Hand: Stay, dear Sir, let me know what you would have me to do. If you would have me &s;tay, I will.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure I would.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, then I will. For it is hard, thought I, if an innocent Per&s;on cannot look up, in her own Hou&s;e too, as it is at pre&s;ent, as I may &s;ay, to a guilty one!&mdash;Guilty in her Heart, at lea&s;t!&mdash;Tho', poor Lady, I hope &s;he is not &s;o in Fact, and, if
<PB N="177" REF="178">
God hears my Prayers, never will, for all Three of our &s;akes.</P>
<P>But, Madam, think for me, what a Task I have! How my Heart throbs in my Bo&s;om! How I trem|ble! How I &s;truggle with my&s;elf! What Rules I form for my Behaviour to this naughty Lady! How they are da&s;h'd in Pieces as &s;oon as form'd, and new ones taken up! And yet I doubt my&s;elf, when I come to the Te&s;t.</P>
<P>But one Thing will help me. I <HI>pity</HI> the poor Lady; and as &s;he comes with the Heart of a Rob|ber, to invade me in my lawful Right, I pride my|&s;elf in a Superiority over this Counte&s;s; and will endeavour to &s;hew her the Country-Girl in a Light which would better become <HI>her</HI> to appear in.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be forced to leave off here; for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is ju&s;t come in to receive his Gue&s;ts; and I am in a &s;ad Flutter upon it. All my Re&s;olution fails me: What &s;hall I do!&mdash;O that this Counte&s;s was come, and gone! &mdash; I tremble &s;o, that I &s;hall behave like a guilty one before the Guilty, who will injoy their Minds, I'll warrant, as if they were innocent! &mdash; Why &s;hould that be? &mdash; But, &s;urely, if all was bad, as this <HI>Turner</HI> has &s;aid, they could not act thus bar|barou&s;ly by me! For I have not de&s;erv'd to be given up to be in&s;ulted! I hope I have not! &mdash; For what have I done?</P>
<P>I have one Comfort, however, in the mid&s;t of all my Griefs; and that is in your Lady&s;hip's Good|ne&s;s, who gives me Leave to a&s;&s;ume the honour'd Title, that, let what will happen, will always give me equal Pride and Plea&s;ure, in &s;ub&s;cribing my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Will now pur&s;ue my la&s;t affecting Subject; for the Vi&s;it is over: But a &s;ad Situation I am in with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> for all that: But I'll try to forget it, till I come to it in cour&s;e, bad as it is.</P>
<P>At Four in the Afternoon Mr. <HI>B.</HI> came in to re|ceive his Gue&s;ts, whom he expected at Five. He came up to me. I had ju&s;t clo&s;ed my la&s;t Letter; but put it up, and &s;et before me your Lady&s;hip's Play Subjects.</P>
<P>So, <HI>Pamela!</HI>&mdash;How do you now?</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip may gue&s;s, by what I wrote before, that I could not give any extraordinary Account of my&s;elf.&mdash;As well&mdash;As well, Sir, as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;Half out of Breath.</P>
<P>You give your&s;elf &s;trange melancholy Airs of late, my Dear!&mdash;You don't do well!&mdash;All that Chearful|ne&s;s which u&s;ed to delight me whenever I &s;aw you, I'm &s;orry for it, is quite vani&s;h'd of late.&mdash;You and I mu&s;t &s;hortly have a little &s;erious Talk together.</P>
<P>When you plea&s;e, Sir.&mdash;I believe it is only not be|ing us'd to this &s;moaky thick Air of <HI>London!</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall be better when you carry me into the Country.&mdash;I dare &s;ay I &s;hall!&mdash;But I never was in <HI>London</HI> &s;o long before, you know, Sir.</P>
<P>All in good time, <HI>Pamela.</HI> &mdash; But is this the be&s;t Appearance you chu&s;e to make to receive &s;uch Gue&s;ts?</P>
<P>If it di&s;plea&s;e you, Sir, I will dre&s;s otherwi&s;e in a Minute.</P>
<P>You look well in any thing.&mdash;But I thought you'd have had your Jewels&mdash;Yet they would never have
<PB N="179" REF="180">
le&s;s become you; for of late your Eyes have lo&s;t that Brilliancy that u&s;ed to &s;trike me with a Lu&s;tre, much &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that of the fine&s;t Diamonds.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for it, Sir.&mdash;But as I never could pride my&s;elf in de&s;erving &s;uch a kind Compliment, I &s;hould be too happy, forgive me, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> if the Failure be not rather in <HI>your</HI> Eyes than <HI>my own.</HI></P>
<P>He looked at me &s;tedfa&s;tly!&mdash;I fear, <HI>Pamela</HI>&mdash; But, don't be a Fool!</P>
<P>You are angry with me, Sir!</P>
<P>No, not I.</P>
<P>Would you have me dre&s;s better?</P>
<P>No, not I&mdash;If your Eyes look'd a little more bril|liant, you want no Addition.</P>
<P>Down he went.</P>
<P>Strange, &s;hort Speeches, the&s;e, my Lady, to what you have heard from his dear Mouth!&mdash;Yet they &s;hall not rob me of the Merit of a patient Sufferer, I am re&s;olv'd, thought I.</P>
<P>Now, my Lady, as I doubted not, my Rival would come adorn'd with every outward Ornament, I put on only a white Damask Gown, having no De&s;ire to vie with her in Appearance; for a virtuous and hone&s;t Heart is my Glory, I ble&s;s God! I wi&s;h the Counte&s;s had the &s;ame to boa&s;t of!</P>
<P>About Five, their Lady&s;hips came in the Coun|te&s;s's new Chariot; for &s;he has not been long out of her tran&s;itory Mourning, and dre&s;s'd as rich as Jewels and a Profu&s;ion of Expence could make her.</P>
<P>I &s;aw them from the Window alight. O how my Heart throbb'd!&mdash;Lie &s;till, &s;aid I, bu&s;y Thing! Why all this Emotion?&mdash;Tho&s;e &s;hining Ornaments cover not &s;uch a guilele&s;s Flutterer as thou. Why then, all this Emotion?</P>
<P>I would not be &s;o officious as to be below to re|ceive them. <HI>Polly Barlow</HI> came up in&s;tantly, from Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181">I ha&s;tened down; tremble, tremble, tremble, went my Feet, in &s;pite of all the Re&s;olution I had been &s;o long endeavouring to collect together.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> pre&s;ented the Counte&s;s to me, both of us cover'd with Blu&s;hes; but from very different Mo|tives, as I imagine.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of&mdash;, my Dear.</P>
<P>She &s;aluted me, and looked, as I thought, half with Envy, half with Shame: But one is apt to form Peoples Countenances by what one judges of their Hearts.</P>
<P>O too lovely! too charming Rivale&s;s! thought I. &mdash;Would to Heaven I &s;aw le&s;s Attractions in you!&mdash; For indeed, indeed, Madam, &s;he is a charming Lady! &mdash;Yet &s;he could not help calling me Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> that was &s;ome Pride; and &s;aid, She had heard me &s;o much prai&s;ed, that &s;he quite long'd to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>Oh! the&s;e villainous Ma&s;querades, thought I!&mdash; You would never have wanted to &s;ee me, but for them, poor naughty Nun, that was!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> pre&s;ented al&s;o the Vi&s;counte&s;s to me: I &s;a|luted her Lady&s;hip; her Si&s;ter &s;aluted me.</P>
<P>She is a graceful Lady; better, as I hope, in Heart; but not equal in Per&s;on to her Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>You have taken no Pains, my Dear, in your Dre&s;s To-day.</P>
<P>The Ladies will excu&s;e it, Sir; I am &s;o often in the Nur&s;ery, when you are ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> an&s;wers her Character, &s;aid the Counte&s;s; &s;he wants no Ornaments. You have a charming little Ma&s;ter, I am told, Madam; but no Wonder, from &s;uch a Pair!</P>
<P>O dear Heart, thought I, i'n't it &s;o!&mdash;Your Lady|&s;hip may gue&s;s, what I thought further.</P>
<P>Will your Lady&s;hip &s;ee him now? &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>He did not look down, no, not one bit!&mdash;tho' the Counte&s;s play'd with her Fan, and looked at him,
<PB N="181" REF="182">
and looked at me, and then looked down, by Turns, a little con&s;ciou&s;ly: While I wrapt up my&s;elf in my Innocence, my fir&s;t Flutters being over, and thought I was &s;uperior, by rea&s;on of that, to a Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>With all my Heart, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>I rang. <HI>Polly,</HI> bid Nur&s;e bring <HI>my Billy</HI> down&mdash; <HI>My,</HI> &s;aid I, with an Empha&s;is.</P>
<P>I met the Nur&s;e at the Stairs Foot, and brought in my dear Baby in my Arms: Such a Child, and &s;uch a Mamma, &s;aid the Vi&s;counte&s;s!</P>
<P>Will you give Ma&s;ter to my Arms, one Moment, Madam? &s;aid the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>Yes, thought I, much rather than my dear naughty Gentleman &s;hould any other.</P>
<P>I <HI>yielded</HI> it to her: I thought &s;he would have &s;tifled it with her warm Ki&s;&s;es! Sweet Boy! Charming Creature! And pre&s;s'd it to her too lovely Bo&s;om, with &s;uch Emotion, looking on the Child, and on Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that I liked it not by any means.</P>
<P>Go, you naughty Lady! thought I:&mdash;But I dur&s;t not &s;ay &s;o. And go, naughty Man, too! thought I; for you &s;eem to look too much gratify'd in your Pride, by her Fondne&s;s for your Boy. I wi&s;h I did not love you &s;o well as I do!&mdash;But neither, your Lady&s;hip may believe, did I &s;ay this.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> looked at me, but with a Bravery, I thought, too like what I had &s;een him look in &s;ome former Scenes, in as bad a Cau&s;e.&mdash;But, thought I, GOD delivered me <HI>then:</HI> I will confide in Him.&mdash; He will <HI>now,</HI> I doubt not, re&s;tore thy Heart to my Prayers; untainted, I hope! for thy own dear &s;ake, as well as mine.</P>
<P>The Vi&s;counte&s;s took the Child from her Si&s;ter, and ki&s;&s;ed him with great Plea&s;ure. She is a mar|ry'd Lady. Would to GOD! the Counte&s;s was too; for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> never corre&s;ponded, as I told your Lady|&s;hip
<PB N="182" REF="183">
once <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. III. <HI>p.</HI> 235, 236.</NOTE>, with marry'd Ladies: So I was not afraid of her Love to my <HI>Billy.</HI>&mdash;But let me, &s;aid the Vi&s;counte&s;s, have the Plea&s;ure of re&s;toring Ma|&s;ter to his charming Mamma. I thought, added &s;he, I never &s;aw a lovelier Sight in my Life, than when in his Mamma's Arms.</P>
<P>Why, I <HI>can't &s;ay,</HI> &s;aid the Counte&s;s, but Ma&s;ter and his Mamma do Credit to one another. Dear Madam let us have the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him &s;till on your Lap, while he is &s;o good.</P>
<P>I wonder'd the dear Baby was &s;o quiet; tho' he is generally &s;o: But <HI>he</HI> might &s;urely, if but by Sympathy, have complained for his poor Mamma, tho' &s;he dur&s;t not for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>How apt one is to ingage every thing in one's Di&s;tre&s;s, when it is deep! And one wonders too, that Things animate and inanimate look with the &s;ame Face, when we are greatly moved by any ex|traordinary and intere&s;ting Event!</P>
<P>I &s;at down with my Baby on my Lap, looking, I believe, with a righteous Boldne&s;s (I will call it &s;o; for well &s;ays the Text, <HI>The Righteous is as bold as a Lion!</HI>) now on my <HI>Billy,</HI> now on his dear Papa, and now on the Counte&s;s, with &s;uch a <HI>Triumph</HI> in my Heart! for I &s;aw her blu&s;h, and look down, and the dear Gentleman &s;eem'd to eye me with a kind of con&s;cious Tenderne&s;s, as I thought.</P>
<P>A Silence of five Minutes, I believe, &s;ucceeded, we all Four looking upon one another, and the little Dear was awake, and &s;tared full upon me with &s;uch innocent Smiles, as if he promi&s;ed to love me, and make me Amends for all.</P>
<P>I ki&s;&s;ed him, and took his pretty little Hand in mine&mdash;You are very good, my Charmer, in this noble Company! &s;aid I.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">I remember'd, Madam, a Scene that made greatly for me in the Papers you have &s;een <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 90.</NOTE>, when, in&s;tead of recriminating, as I might have done, before Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> for hard U&s;age, (for Oh! my Lady, your dear Brother has a hard Heart, indeed he has, when he plea&s;es) I only prayed for him on my Knees.</P>
<P>And I hope I was not now too mean; for I had Dignity and a proud Superiority in my vain Heart, over them all.&mdash;Then it was not my Part to be up|on Defiances, where I lov'd, and where I hoped to reclaim. Be&s;ides, what had I done by it, but ju&s;ti|fy'd, &s;eemingly, by After-Acts in a pa&s;&s;ionate Re|&s;entment, to their Minds, at lea&s;t, their too wicked Treatment of me? Moreover, your Lady&s;hip will remember, that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> knew not, that I was ac|quainted with his Intrigue, I mu&s;t call it &s;o!&mdash;If he had, he is too noble to in&s;ult me by &s;uch a Vi&s;it; and he had told me, I &s;hould &s;ee the Lady he was at <HI>Oxford</HI> with.</P>
<P>And this, breaking Silence, he mention'd; &s;aying, I gave you Hope, my Dear, that I &s;hould procure you the Honour of a Vi&s;it from the Lady who put her&s;elf under my Care at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>I bow'd my Head to the Counte&s;s; but my Tears being ready to &s;tart, I ki&s;s'd my <HI>Billy:</HI> Deare&s;t Baby, &s;aid I, you are not going to cry, are you?&mdash;I would have had him ju&s;t then to cry, in&s;tead of me.</P>
<P>The Tea Equipage was brought in. <HI>Polly,</HI> carry the Child to Nur&s;e. I gave it another Ki&s;s, and the Counte&s;s de&s;ired another. I grudged it, to think her naughty Lips &s;hould &s;o clo&s;ely follow mine. Her Si&s;ter ki&s;&s;ed it al&s;o, and carry'd him to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> Take him away, <HI>Polly,</HI> &s;aid he:&mdash;I owe him my Ble&s;&s;ing!</P>
<P>Oh! the&s;e young Gentlemen Papa's! &s;aid the Counte&s;s&mdash;They are like young unbroken Hor&s;es,
<PB N="184" REF="185">
ju&s;t put into the Traces.!&mdash;Are they &s;o, thought I! &mdash;Matrimony mu&s;t not expect your good Word! I doubt!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> after Tea, at which I was far from being talkative, (for I could not tell what to &s;ay; tho' I try'd, as much as I could, not to appear &s;ullen) de|&s;ir'd the Counte&s;s to play one Tune upon the Spinnet. She did, and &s;ung, at his Reque&s;t, an <HI>Italian</HI> Song to it, very prettily; too prettily, I thought! I wanted to find &s;ome Faults, &s;ome great Faults in her: But Oh! Madam! &s;he has too many outward Excellen|cies! Pity &s;he wants a good Heart.</P>
<P>He could ask nothing, that &s;he was not ready to oblige him in! Indeed he could not!</P>
<P>She de&s;ired <HI>me</HI> to touch the Keys. I would have been excus'd: but could not. And the Ladies com|mended my Performance: But neither my Heart to play, nor my Fingers in playing, de&s;erv'd their Prai&s;es. Mr. <HI>B. &s;aid</HI> indeed, You play better &s;ome|times, my Dear!&mdash;Do I, Sir? was all the An&s;wer I made.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s hoped, &s;he &s;aid, I would return her Vi&s;it; and &s;o &s;aid the Vi&s;counte&s;s.</P>
<P>I reply'd, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> would command me whenever he pleas'd.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, She hoped to be better acquainted&mdash;(I hope not, thought I) and that I would give her my Company for a Week or &s;o, upon the Fore&s;t: It &s;eems &s;he has a Seat upon <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, added &s;he, you can't ride a &s;ingle Hor&s;e; but we'll learn you there. 'Tis a &s;weet Place for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>How came Mr. <HI>B.</HI> thought I, to tell <HI>you</HI> that, Madam? I &s;uppo&s;e you know more of me than I do my&s;elf. Indeed, my Lady, this may be too true; for &s;he may know what is to become of me!</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186">I told her, I was very much oblig'd to her Lady|&s;hip; but Mr. <HI>B.</HI> directed all my Motions.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you, Sir? &s;aid the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>I can't promi&s;e that, Madam; for Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> wants to go down to <HI>Kent,</HI> before we go to <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> and I am afraid I can't give her my Company thither.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, I &s;han't chu&s;e to go without you.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e not, my Dear. But, if you are di&s;|po&s;ed to oblige the Counte&s;s for a Week, as you never were at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, interrupted I, what with my little Nur&s;ery, and <HI>one</HI> thing or <HI>another,</HI> I mu&s;t deny my|&s;elf that Honour, for this Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, then I'll expect you in <HI>Pallmall.</HI></P>
<P>I bow'd my Head, and &s;aid, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> would com|mand me.</P>
<P>They took Leave with a Politene&s;s natural to them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> as he handed them to their Chariot, &s;aid &s;omething in <HI>Italian</HI> to the Counte&s;s: The Word <HI>Pamela</HI> was in what he &s;aid: She an&s;wer'd him, with a downca&s;t Look, in the &s;ame Language, half pleas'd, half &s;erious; and the Chariot drove away.</P>
<P>I would give, &s;aid I, a good deal, Sir, to know what her Lady&s;hip &s;aid to you; &s;he look'd with &s;o particular a Meaning, if I may &s;o &s;ay.</P>
<P>I'll tell you, truly, <HI>Pamela</HI>: I &s;aid to her, Well, now your Lady&s;hip has &s;een my <HI>Pamela</HI>!&mdash;Is &s;he not the charming'&s;t Girl in the World?</P>
<P>She an&s;wer'd, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> is very grave, for &s;o young a Lady: But I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, She is a lovely Crea|ture.</P>
<P>And did you &s;ay &s;o, Sir? And did her Lady&s;hip &s;o an&s;wer?&mdash;And my Heart was ready to leap out of my Bo&s;om for Joy.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">But my Folly &s;poil'd all again; for, to my own Surprize and great Regret, I bur&s;t out into Tears; tho' I even &s;obb'd to have &s;uppre&s;s'd them, but could not; and &s;o I lo&s;t a fine Opportunity to have talked to him while he was &s;o kind: For he was angry with me.</P>
<P>What made me &s;uch a Fool, I wonder! But I had &s;o long &s;truggled with my&s;elf; and not expecting &s;o kind a Que&s;tion from the dear Gentleman, or &s;uch a favourable An&s;wer from the Counte&s;s, I had no longer any Command of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>What ails the little Fool? &s;aid he, with a wrathful Countenance, that made me wor&s;e.&mdash;Take care, take care, <HI>Pamela</HI>!&mdash;You'll drive me from you in &s;pite of my own Heart.</P>
<P>So he went into the be&s;t Parlour, and put on his Sword, and took his Hat, &mdash; Sir, Sir! with my Arms expanded, was all I could &s;ay; but he avoided me, putting on his Hat with an Air, and out he went, bidding <HI>Abraham</HI> follow him.</P>
<P>This is the Dilemma, into which, as I hinted at the Beginning of this Letter, I have brought my&s;elf with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> How &s;trong, how prevalent, is the Pa&s;&s;ion of Jealou&s;y, that thus it will &s;hew it&s;elf uppermo&s;t, when it is uppermo&s;t, in &s;pite of one's mo&s;t watchful Regards!</P>
<P>My Mind is &s;o perplex'd, that I mu&s;t lay down my Pen: And, indeed, your Lady&s;hip will wonder, all Things con&s;ider'd, that I could write the above Account as I have done, in this cruel Su&s;pen&s;e, and with &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions. But Writing is all the Diver&s;ion I have, when my Mind is oppre&s;s'd. 'Tis a temporary Relief; and this Interview was &s;o intere&s;ting, that it took up a great deal of my Atten|tion while I wrote: But now I am come to a Period of it, and &s;o unhappy an one, as has re&s;ulted from my ungovern'd Pa&s;&s;ion, my Apprehen&s;ions are return'd

<P>How &s;hall I do to look up to him now on his Return! To be &s;ure, he plainly &s;ees, to what my Emotion is owing!&mdash;Yet I dare not tell him either my Information, or my Informant, becau&s;e if he knows the one, he will know the other; and then what may be the Con&s;equence!</P>

<P>I Would not have you &s;it up for me.

<P>My bu&s;y Apprehen&s;ion immediately &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that I was to be terrified, with a high Hand, into a Compliance with &s;ome new Scheme or other that was projecting. But I had re&s;olved to make their Way as clear to one another as was in my Power, if they would have it &s;o; and &s;o I try'd to allay my Grief as much as I could; and it being near One, and hearing nothing from Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I bid <HI>Polly</HI> go to Bed, thinking &s;he would wonder at our Intercour&s;e by Letter, if I &s;hould &s;end again.</P>
<P>So down I ventur'd, my Feet, however, trem|bling, all the way, and tapp'd at the Door of his Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Who's that?</P>
<P>I, Sir: One Word, if you plea&s;e. Don't be more angry, however, Sir.</P>
<P>He open'd the Door: Thus poor <HI>He&s;ter,</HI> to her Royal Husband, ventur'd her Life, to break in upon him unbidden. But that <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Monarch, great as he was, extended to the fainting Suppliant the golden Sceptre!</P>
<P>He took my Hand: I hope, my Dear, by this Tragedy Speech, we are not to expect any &s;ad Ca|ta&s;trophe to our pre&s;ent Mi&s;under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191">I hope not, Sir. But 'tis all as God and you &s;hall plea&s;e. I am re&s;olv'd to do my Duty, Sir, if po&s;&s;ible. But, indeed, I cannot bear this cruel Su&s;|pen&s;e! Let me know what is to become of me.&mdash; Let me know but what is de&s;ign'd for me, and you &s;hall be &s;ure of all the Acquie&s;cence that my Duty and Con&s;cience can give to your Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>What <HI>means</HI> the dear Creature! What <HI>means</HI> my <HI>Pamela!</HI>&mdash; Surely your Head, Child, is a little af|fected!</P>
<P>I can't tell, Sir, but it may!&mdash; But let me have my Trial, that you write about. Appoint my Day of Hearing, and &s;peedily too; for I would not bear &s;uch another Month, as the la&s;t has been, for the World.</P>
<P>Come, my Dear, &s;aid he, let me attend you to your Chamber. But your Mind has taken much too &s;olemn a Turn, to enter further now upon this Subject. Think as well of me, as I do of you, and I &s;hall be happy as ever.</P>
<P>I wept&mdash;Be not angry, dear Sir: Your kind Words have ju&s;t the &s;ame Effect upon me now, as in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>Your Apprehen&s;ions, my Dear, mu&s;t be very &s;trong, that a kind Word, as you call it, has &s;uch an Effect upon you! But let us wave the Subject for a few Days, becau&s;e I am to &s;et out on a little Journey at Four, and had not intended to go to Bed for &s;o few Hours.</P>
<P>When we came up, I &s;aid, I was very bold, Sir, to break in upon you; but I could not help it, if my Life had been the Forfeit: And you receiv'd me with more Goodne&s;s than I could have expected. But will you pardon me, if I ask, Whither you go &s;o &s;oon? And if you had intended to have gone without taking Leave of me?</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="192">I go to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> my Dear. I &s;hould have &s;tept up, and taken Leave of you before I went.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, I will not ask you, Who is of your Party?&mdash; I will not&mdash; No, putting my Hand to his Lips&mdash; Don't tell me, Sir: It mayn't be proper.&mdash;</P>
<P>Don't fear, my Dear; I won't tell you: Nor am I certain whether it be <HI>proper</HI> or not, till we are come to a better Under&s;tanding.&mdash;Only, once more, think as well of me, as I do of you!</P>
<P>Would to Heaven, thought I, there was the &s;ame Rea&s;on for the one as the other!</P>
<P>I intended (for my Heart was full) to enter fur|ther into this Subject, &s;o fatal to my Repo&s;e: But the dear Gentleman had no &s;ooner laid his Hand on the Pillow, but he fell a&s;leep, or &s;eem'd to do &s;o, and that was as prohibitory to my Talking, as if he had. So I had all my own entertaining Reflections to my&s;elf; which gave me not one Wink of Sleep; but made me of &s;o much Service to him, as to tell him when the Clock &s;truck Four, that he &s;hould not (tho' I did not &s;ay &s;o, you may think, Madam) make my ready Rivale&s;s (for I doubted not her being one of the Party) wait for him.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e, and was dre&s;s'd in&s;tantly; and &s;aluting me, bid me be ea&s;y and happy, while it was <HI>yet</HI> in my own Power.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, He &s;hould be back on <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, as he believ'd. And I wi&s;h'd him, mo&s;t fervently, I am &s;ure! Health, Plea&s;ure, and Safety.</P>
<P>Here, Madam, mu&s;t I end this Letter. My next will, perhaps, contain my Trial, and my Sentence: God give me but Patience and Re&s;ignation, and then, whatever occurs, I &s;hall not be unhappy: E&s;pe|cially while I can have, in the la&s;t Re&s;ource, the Plea|&s;ure of calling my&s;elf</P>

<P>Ju&s;t above I called my State, a State of <HI>cruel Su&s;pen&s;e</HI>! But I recall the Words: For now it is no longer Su&s;pen&s;e; &s;ince, if this Letter &s;ays Truth, I know the wor&s;t: And there is too much Appear|ance that it does, let the Writer be who it will, or his or her Motive what it will; for, after all, I am apt to fan&s;y this, a Contrivance of Mr. <HI>Turner</HI>'s; tho', for fear of ill Con&s;equences, I will not &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>And now, Madam, I am endeavouring, by the Help of Religion, and cool Reflection, to bring my Mind to bear this heavy Evil, and to recollect, what I <HI>was,</HI> and how much more honourable an E&s;tate I <HI>am in,</HI> than I could ever have expected to be; and that my Virtue and good Name are &s;ecur'd; and I can return innocent to my dear Father and Mo|ther: And the&s;e were once the only Pride of my Hope.</P>
<P>Then, additional to what I was, at that Time, (and yet I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with my Pro&s;pects, poor as they were) I have hone&s;t Parents bountifully provided for, thank God, and your ever dear Brother, for this Ble&s;&s;ing!&mdash;and not only provided for&mdash;but made
<PB N="194" REF="195">
u&s;eful to him, to the Amount of their Provi&s;ion, well nigh! There is a Pride, my Lady!</P>
<P>Then I &s;hall have better Conditions from his Ge|nero&s;ity to &s;upport my&s;elf, than I can wi&s;h for, or make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Then I have my dear, charming <HI>Billy</HI>&mdash; O! be contented, too charming, and too happy Rivale&s;s, with my Husband! and tear not from me my deare&s;t Baby, the Pledge, the beloved Pledge of our hap|pier Affections, and the dear Remembrance of what I once was.&mdash; But if, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> you doubt the Education I can give him, fit for the Heir to your great Fortune, (for &s;uch he mu&s;t be, de&s;pi&s;ed or abandon'd as his poor Mother may be!) and will remove him from me, and Grief kill me not before that &s;ad Hour, let me have &s;ome Office, not in|compatible with that of his Tutor, to in&s;til Virtue into his ductile Mind; for Tutors, altho' they may make Youth learned, do not always make them virtuous; and let me watch over his Steps, and where-ever he goes, let me go: I &s;hall value no Dangers nor Ri&s;ques; the mo&s;t di&s;tant Clime &s;hall be native to me, where-ever my <HI>Billy</HI> is; &s;o that I may be a Guard, under God, to his Morals, that he make no Virgin's Heart &s;igh, nor Mother's bleed, as mine has done in both States.</P>
<P>But how I rave, will your Lady&s;hip be apt to &s;ay?&mdash; This is no good Symptom, you'll think, that I have reap'd at pre&s;ent that Con&s;olation from religious Con&s;iderations, which, to a right Turn of Mind, they will afford in the heavie&s;t Misfortunes. But this was only in fear they would take my <HI>Billy</HI> from me: A thou&s;and plea&s;ing Pro&s;pects, that had begun to dawn on my Mind, I can bear to have di&s;&s;ipated; but I cannot permit my dear Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s Son and Heir to be torn from me.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196">Yet I hope they will not be &s;o cruel; for I will give them no Provocation to do it, if I can help it. No Law-&s;uits, no Complainings, no A&s;perities of Expre&s;&s;ion, much le&s;s bitter Reflections, &s;hall they ever have from me. I will be no Con&s;cience to them: They will be puni&s;hed too much, greatly too much, in their own, for what I wi&s;h; and they &s;hall always be followed by my Prayers. I &s;hall have Lei&s;ure for that Exerci&s;e, and &s;hall be happy and &s;erene when, I doubt, I doubt, they will not be &s;o!</P>
<P>But &s;till I am running on in a Strain that &s;hews my Impatience, rather than my Re&s;ignation: Yet &s;ome Struggles mu&s;t be allow'd me; I could not have loved, as I love, if I could ea&s;ily part with my In|tere&s;t in &s;o beloved a Husband.&mdash; For, Madam, my Intere&s;t I will part with, and will &s;ooner die, than live with a Gentleman, who has another Wife, tho' I was the fir&s;t. &mdash; Let Counte&s;&s;es, if they can, and Ladies of Birth, chu&s;e to humble them&s;elves to this Ba&s;ene&s;s&mdash;The low-born <HI>Pamela</HI> cannot &s;toop to &s;uch Meanne&s;s.

<P>He's come! He's come! now, ju&s;t now, come! I will have my Trial over before this Night be pa&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible.

<P>The dear Gentleman has receiv'd me with great Affection and Tenderne&s;s. Sure he cannot be &s;o bad!&mdash; Sure he cannot!</P>
<P>I know, my Dear, &s;aid he, I left you in great Anxiety; but 'tis an Anxiety you have brought upon your&s;elf; and I have not been ea&s;y ever &s;ince I left you.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for it, Sir.</P>
<P>Why my dear Love, there is &s;till a melancholy Air in your Countenance: Indeed it &s;eems mingled with a kind of Joy, I hope at my Return to you. But 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee which of the two is the mo&s;t natural.</P>

<P>I am &s;orry you cannot, reply'd he. But I am come Home to hear all your Grievances, and to redre&s;s them, if in my Power.</P>
<P>When, Sir, am I to come upon my Trial? I have a great deal to &s;ay to you. I will tell you every thing I think! And as it may be the la&s;t Griev|ances,

<P>Don't let it alarm you, Sir! I mean you nothing but Good!&mdash; But I have been preparing my&s;elf to tell you all my Mind.

<P>O, Sir, Sir, treat me not thus kindly! Put on an awfuller Brow, or how &s;hall I retain my Purpo&s;e! How &s;hall I!</P>
<P>Dear, dear Creature! make not u&s;e of <HI>all</HI> your Powers to melt me! <HI>Half</HI> of them is enough.

<P>For, my dear Lady, this is a Point of high Im|portance. It has touched and rais'd my Soul be|yond its Pitch: I am a <HI>new Pamela,</HI> as he &s;ays, and a <HI>proud Pamela,</HI> as he will find&mdash; For, Madam, the Per&s;on who can &s;upport her&s;elf under an Injury like this, and can re&s;olve to forgive it, has a Supe|riority to the Injurer, let him be a Prince, tho' &s;he were but a Beggar-born. But the Difficulty will be, how to avoid being melted by my own Softne&s;s, and Love for the Man, more dear to me than Life; yea, more dear to me, than my <HI>Billy,</HI> and than all my Hopes in the charming Boy. But here he comes!</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Pamela</HI>&mdash; Now, &s;ee what thou can&s;t do!&mdash; Thou knowe&s;t the wor&s;t! Remember that!&mdash; And may'&s;t not be unhappy, even <HI>at</HI> the wor&s;t, if thou tru&s;te&s;t in GOD.</P>
<P>I am commanded, my dear Lady, now to write particularly my Trial, for a Rea&s;on I &s;hall mention to you in the Conclu&s;ion of this Letter; and I mu&s;t beg you to favour me with the Return of all my
<PB N="201" REF="202">
Letters to you, on this affecting Subject.&mdash; The Rea&s;on will appear in its Place&mdash; And Oh! congra|tulate me, my dear, dear Lady; for I am happy, and &s;hall be happier than I ever was; and that I thought, &s;o did every body, was impo&s;&s;ible. But I will not anticipate the Account of my Trial, and the Effects, the ble&s;&s;ed Effects, it has produced. Thus then it was:</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> came up, with great Impatience in his Looks. I met him at my Chamber-door, with as &s;edate a Countenance, as I po&s;&s;ibly could put on, and my Heart was high with my Purpo&s;e, and &s;up|ported me better than I could have expected. &mdash; Yet, on Recollection, now, I impute to my&s;elf &s;omething of that kind of noble Enthu&s;ia&s;m, that was wont to in&s;pire the innocent Sufferers of old, for a &s;till worthier Cau&s;e than mine; though their Motives could hardly be more pure, in that one Hope I had to be an humble Means of &s;aving the Man I love and honour, from Errors that might be fatal to his Soul.</P>
<P>I took his Hand with Boldne&s;s: Dear Sir, leading him to my Clo&s;et, Here is the Bar, at which I am to take my Trial, pointing to the Backs of three Chairs, which I had placed in a join'd Row, leav|ing ju&s;t Room to go by on each Side&mdash; You mu&s;t give me, Sir, all my own Way; this is the fir&s;t, and perhaps the la&s;t Time, that I &s;hall de&s;ire it.&mdash; Nay, dear Sir, turning my Face from him, look not upon me with an Eye of Tenderne&s;s; if you do, I may lo&s;e my Purpo&s;es, important to me as they are; and however fanta&s;tick my Behaviour may &s;eem to you, I want not to move your Pa&s;&s;ions, but your Rea&s;on; and if that can be done, I am &s;afe, and &s;hall fear no Relap&s;e: The others will rai&s;e but a tran&s;ient Hope, which the Winds of Sen&s;e may ea&s;ily di&s;&s;ipate; and I regard it accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">What means all this Parade, my Dear? Let me peri&s;h, that was his Word, if I know how to ac|count for <HI>You,</HI> or your <HI>Humour.</HI></P>
<P>You will pre&s;ently, Sir. But give me all my Way&mdash; I pray you do, this once&mdash; this one Time only!</P>
<P>Well, &s;o, this is your Bar, is it? There's an Elbow-chair, I &s;ee; take your Place in it, <HI>Pamela,</HI> and here I'll &s;tand to an&s;wer all your Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>No, Sir, that mu&s;t not be. So I boldly led <HI>him</HI> to the Elbow-chair. You are the Judge, Sir; it is I that am to be try'd. Yet I will not &s;ay I am a Criminal. I know I am not. But that mu&s;t be proved, Sir, you know.</P>
<P>Well, take your way; but I fear for your Head, my Dear, in all this.</P>
<P>I fear only my Heart, Sir, that's all: But there you mu&s;t &s;it&mdash; So here (retiring to the three Chairs, and leaning on the Backs, here) I &s;tand.</P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> you mu&s;t begin fir&s;t: When you &s;hew'd me the Hou&s;e of Peers, their Bar, at which Cau&s;es are heard, and &s;ometimes Peers are try'd, look'd awful to me, and the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion requires, that this &s;hould. Now, dear Sir, you mu&s;t be my Accu&s;er, as well as my Judge.</P>
<P>I have nothing to accu&s;e you of, my Dear, if I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> give into your moving Whim&s;y. You are every thing I wi&s;h you to be. But for the la&s;t Month you have &s;eem'd to be unea&s;y, and have not done me the Ju&s;tice to acquaint me with your Rea|&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>I was in hopes, Sir, my Rea&s;ons might prove to be no Rea&s;ons; and I would not trouble you with my ungrounded Apprehen&s;ions. But now, Sir, we are come directly to the Point; and methinks I &s;tand here as <HI>Paul</HI> did before <HI>Felix</HI>; and, like that poor Pri&s;oner, if I, Sir, rea&s;on of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Tempe|rance</HI> and <HI>Judgment to come,</HI> even to make you, as
<PB N="203" REF="204">
the great <HI>Felix</HI> did, tremble, don't put me off <HI>to another Day,</HI> to a <HI>more convenient Sea&s;on,</HI> as that Governor did <HI>Paul</HI>; for you mu&s;t bear patiently with all I have to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Strange, uncommon Girl! how unaccountable is all this!&mdash; Pr'ythee, my Dear, and he pulled a Chair by him, Come and &s;it down by me, and without the&s;e romantick Airs let me hear all you have to &s;ay; and teize me not with this Parade.</P>
<P>No, Sir, let me &s;tand, if you plea&s;e, while I <HI>can</HI> &s;tand; when I am weary, I will &s;it down at my Bar.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, as you are &s;o good as to &s;ay, you have nothing but Change of Temper to accu&s;e me of, I am to an&s;wer to that, and a&s;&s;ign a Cau&s;e; and I will do it without Eva&s;ion, or Re&s;erve: But, I be&s;eech you, &s;ay not one Word, but Yes, or No, to my Que&s;tions, 'till I have &s;aid all I have to &s;ay; and then you &s;hall find me all Silence and Re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Well, my &s;trange Dear!&mdash; But &s;ure your Head is a little turn'd!&mdash; What is your Que&s;tion?</P>
<P>Whether, Sir, the Nun &mdash; I &s;peak boldly; the Ca&s;e requires it&mdash;who followed you at the Ma&s;querade every-where, is not the Counte&s;s of &mdash;?</P>
<P>What then, my Dear? (&s;peaking with Quickne&s;s) &mdash; I <HI>thought</HI> the Occa&s;ion of your Sullenne&s;s and Re&s;erve was this! &mdash; But, <HI>Pamela</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, interrupted I, only Yes, or No, if you plea&s;e: I will be all Silence by-and-by.</P>
<P>Yes, then.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, then let me <HI>tell</HI> you, for I <HI>ask</HI> you not, (it may be too bold in me to multiply Que&s;tions) that &s;he <HI>loves</HI> you; that you corre&s;pond by Letters with her &mdash; Yes, Sir, <HI>before</HI> that Letter from her Lady&s;hip came, which you receiv'd from my Hand in &s;o &s;hort and angry a manner, for fear I &s;hould have had a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee its Contents, which would have been inexcu&s;able in me, I own, if I had. You
<PB N="204" REF="205">
have talked over to her all your Polygamy Notions, and her Lady&s;hip &s;eems &s;o well convinc'd of them, that &s;he has declar'd to her noble Uncle, (who expo|&s;tulated with her on the Occa&s;ions &s;he gave for Talk) that &s;he had rather be a certain Gentleman's &s;econd Wife, than the fir&s;t to the greate&s;t Man in <HI>England</HI>; and you are but ju&s;t return'd from a Journey to <HI>Tun|bridge,</HI> in which that Lady was a Party; and the Motive for it, I am acquainted with, by a Letter here in my Hand.</P>
<P>He was di&s;plea&s;ed, and frowned: I look'd down, being re&s;olv'd not to be terrified, if I could help it.</P>
<P>I have caution'd you, <HI>Pamela</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>I know you have, Sir, interrupted I; but be plea&s;ed to an&s;wer me, Has not the Counte&s;s taken a Hou&s;e or Lodgings at <HI>Tunbridge?</HI></P>
<P>She has: &mdash; And what then?</P>
<P>And is her Lady&s;hip there, or in Town?</P>
<P><HI>There:</HI> And what then?</P>
<P>Are you to go to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> Sir, &s;oon, or not? Be plea&s;ed to an&s;wer me but that one Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I will know, ri&s;ing up in Anger, your Informants, <HI>Pamela.</HI></P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;o you &s;hall, in proper Time; you &s;hall know all, as &s;oon as I am convinc'd, that your Wrath will not be attended with bad Con&s;equences to your|&s;elf and others. That is wholly the Cau&s;e of my Re&s;erve in this Point; for I have not a Thought, and never had, &s;ince I have been yours, that I wi&s;h to be concealed from you. &mdash; But, dear Sir, your Know|lege of the Informants makes nothing at all as to the Truth of the Information. &mdash; Nor will I pre&s;s you too home. I doubt not, you are &s;oon to go down to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> again.</P>
<P>I <HI>am:</HI> And what then? &mdash; Mu&s;t the Con&s;equence be Crime enough to warrant your Jealou&s;y?</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206">Dear Sir, don't be &s;o very angry, &s;till looking down; for I dur&s;t not tru&s;t my&s;elf to look up. I don't do this, as you charged me in your Letter, in a Spirit of matrimonial Recrimination: If you don't <HI>tell</HI> me, that you &s;ee the Counte&s;s with Plea&s;ure, I <HI>ask</HI> it not of you; nor have I any thing to &s;ay by way of Up|braiding. 'Tis my Misfortune, that &s;he is too lovely, and too attractive; and it is the le&s;s Wonder, that a fine young Gentleman as you are, and a fine young Lady as &s;he is, &s;hould engage one another's Affe|ctions.</P>
<P>I knew all this, except what this Letter, which you &s;hall read pre&s;ently, communicates, when you brought the two noble Si&s;ters to vi&s;it me: Hence proceeded my Grief; and &s;hould I, Sir, have de&s;erv'd to be what I am, if I was <HI>not</HI> griev'd? Religion has helped me, Sir, and God has an&s;wer'd my Supplica|tions, to inable me to act this new and uncommon Part before you, at this imaginary Bar. You &s;hall &s;ee, Sir, that as, on one hand, I want not, as I &s;aid before, to move your Pa&s;&s;ions in my Favour; &s;o, on the other, I &s;hall not be terrified by your Di&s;|plea&s;ure, dreaded by me as it u&s;ed to be, and as it will be again, the Moment that my rai&s;ed Spirits &s;ink down to their u&s;ual Level; or are diverted from this my long meditated Purpo&s;e, to tell you all my Mind.</P>
<P>I repeat then, Sir, that I knew all this, when the two noble Si&s;ters came to vi&s;it your poor Girl, and your <HI>Billy.</HI> Yet, <HI>grave,</HI> as the Counte&s;s called me, (dear Sir! might I not well be grave, knowing what I knew?) did I betray any Impatience of Speech or Action, any Di&s;compo&s;ure?</P>
<P>No, Sir, patting my Hand on my Brea&s;t, <HI>here</HI> all the Di&s;compo&s;ure lay, &s;truggling, vehemently &s;truggling, now-and-then, and wanting that Vent at my Eyes, which, it &s;eems, (overcome by my Joy, to

hear my&s;elf favourably &s;poken of by you and the Lady) it <HI>too &s;oon</HI> made it&s;elf. But I could not help it&mdash;You might have &s;een, Sir, I could not!</P>
<P>But I want neither to recriminate, nor expo&s;tulate, nor yet, Sir, to form Excu&s;es for my general Con|duct; for that you accu&s;e not in the main. &mdash; But be plea&s;ed, Sir, to read this Letter. It was brought by the Peny-Po&s;t, as you'll &s;ee by the Mark. Who the Writer is, I know not. And did <HI>you,</HI> Sir, that Know|lege, and your Re&s;entment upon it, will not alter the Fact, or give it a more favourable Appearance.</P>
<P>I &s;tepp'd to him, and giving him the Letter, came back to my Bar, and &s;at down on one of the Chairs while he read it, drying my Eyes; for they would overflow as I talked, do what I could.</P>
<P>He was much moved at the Contents of this Letter. Called it d&mdash;n'd Malice, and hoped he might find out the Author of it, &s;aying he would adverti&s;e 500 Guineas Reward for the Di&s;coverer.</P>
<P>He put the Letter in his Pocket, Well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you believe all that you have &s;aid, no doubt; and this Matter has a black Appearance indeed, if you do. But who was your <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Informant? Was that by Letter, or per&s;onally? That d&mdash;n'd <HI>Turner,</HI> I doubt not, is at the Bottom of all this. The vain Coxcomb has had the In&s;olence to imagine the Counte&s;s would favour an Addre&s;s of his; and is inraged to meet with a Repul&s;e; and has taken Liberties upon it, that have given Birth to all the Scandals which have been &s;catter'd about on this Occa&s;ion. Nor do I doubt, but he has been the Serpent at the Ear of my <HI>Eve.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;tood up at my Bar, and &s;aid, Don't be too ha&s;ty, Sir, in your Judgment&mdash;You <HI>may</HI> be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But <HI>am</HI> I mi&s;taken, <HI>Pamela?</HI>&mdash;You never yet told me an Untruth in Ca&s;es the mo&s;t arduous. <HI>Am</HI> I mi&s;taken?</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">Dear Sir, if I &s;hould tell you it is <HI>not</HI> Mr. <HI>Turner,</HI> you'll gue&s;s at &s;omebody el&s;e: And what avails all this to the Matter in Hand? You are your own Ma&s;ter, and mu&s;t &s;tand and fall by your own Con|&s;cience. God grant, that <HI>that</HI> may acquit you!&mdash; But my Intention is not either to accu&s;e or upbraid you.</P>
<P>But, my Dear, to the Fact then: This is a mali|cious and a villainous Piece of Intelligence! given you, perhaps, for the &s;ake of De&s;igns and Views, that may not yet be proper to be avow'd.</P>
<P>By God's Grace, Sir, I defy all De&s;igns and Views of any one, upon my Honour!</P>
<P>But, my Dear, the Charge is ba&s;ely fal&s;e: We have not agreed upon any &s;uch way of Life.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, all this only proves, that the Intelli|gence may be a little premature. But now let me, Sir, &s;it down one Minute or two, to recover my failing Spirits, and then I'll tell you all I purpo&s;e to do, and all I have to &s;ay, and that with as much Brevity as I can, for fear neither my Head nor my Heart &s;hould perform the Parts I have been &s;o long endeavouring to prevail upon them to perform.</P>
<P>I &s;at down then, he taking the Letter out of his Pocket, and looking upon it again, with much Vexation and Anger in his Countenance; and after a few Tears and Sobs, that would needs be &s;o offi|cious as to offer their Service, unbidden and un|de&s;ired, to introduce what I had to &s;ay; I ro&s;e up, my Feet trembling, as well as my Knees; which however, leaning again&s;t the Seats of the Chairs, which made my Bar, as my Hand, held by the Back, tole|rably &s;upported me, I cleared my Voice, wiped my Eyes, and &s;aid:</P>
<P>You have all the Excu&s;es, dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that a Gentleman can have, in the Object of your pre&s;ent Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="209">Pre&s;ent Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>Pamela!</HI></P>
<P>Dear Sir, hear me out, without Interruption.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s is a charming Lady. She excels your poor Girl in all tho&s;e outward Graces of Form, that your kind Fancy (more valu'd by me than the Opinion of all the World be&s;ides) had made you attribute to me. And &s;he has all tho&s;e additional Advantages, as Noblene&s;s of Birth, of Alliance, and Deportment, which I want (Happy for you, Sir, that you had known her Lady&s;hip &s;ome Months ago, before you di&s;grac'd your&s;elf by the Honours you have done me!). This, therefore, frees you from the aggravated Crime of tho&s;e, who prefer to their own Ladies le&s;s amiable and le&s;s de&s;erving Per&s;ons; and I have not the Sting that the&s;e mu&s;t have, who are contemn'd and ill-treated for their Inferiors. Yet cannot the Counte&s;s love you better than your Girl; not even for your Per&s;on, which mu&s;t, I doubt, be <HI>her</HI> principal Attachment; when I can truly &s;ay, all noble and attracting to the outward Eye as you are, that is the lea&s;t Con&s;ideration by far with me: No, Sir, it is your Mind, your generous and beneficent Mind, that is the principal Object of my Affection; and the Pride I took in hoping, that I might be an humble Means, in the Hands of Providence, to ble&s;s you <HI>hereafter</HI> as well as <HI>here,</HI> gave me more Joy than all the Ble&s;&s;ings I reaped from your Name or your Fortune. Judge then, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> what my Grief and my Di&s;appointment mu&s;t be!</P>
<P>But I will not expo&s;tulate; I <HI>will not,</HI> becau&s;e it mu&s;t be to no Purpo&s;e; for could my Fondne&s;s for you, and my watchful Duty to you, have kept you &s;teady, I &s;hould not now have appear'd before you in this &s;olemn manner; and I know the Charms of my Rivale&s;s are too powerful for me to contend with. Nothing but Divine Grace can touch your
<PB N="209" REF="210">
Heart; and that I expect not, from the Nature of the Ca&s;e, &s;hould be in&s;tantaneous.</P>
<P>I will therefore, Sir, dear as you are to me, (don't look with &s;uch tender Surprize upon me!) give up your Per&s;on to my happier, to my <HI>worthier</HI> Rivale&s;s. For, &s;ince &s;uch is your Will, and &s;uch &s;eem to be your Ingagements, what avails it me to oppo&s;e them?</P>
<P>I have only to beg, therefore, that you will be &s;o good as to permit me to go down to <HI>Kent,</HI> to my dear Parents, who, with many more, are daily rejoicing in your Favour and Bounty.</P>
<P>I will there (holding up my folded Hands) pray for you every Hour of my Life; and for every one, who &s;hall be dear to you, not excepting your charming Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>I will never take your Name into my Lips, nor &s;uffer any other in my Hearing, but with Reverence and Gratitude, for the Good I and mine <HI>have</HI> reap'd at your Hands; nor will I wi&s;h to be freed from my Obligations to you, except you &s;hall chu&s;e to be divorced from me; and if you &s;hould, I will give your Wi&s;hes all the Forwardne&s;s that I honourably can, with regard to my own Character, and yours, and that of my beloved Baby.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t give me &s;omething worth living for along with me; your <HI>Billy</HI> and mine! &mdash; Unle&s;s it is your De&s;ire to kill me quite; and then, 'tis done, and nothing will &s;tand in your happy Counte&s;s's Way, if you tear from my Arms my <HI>&s;econd</HI> earthly Good, after I am depriv'd of You, my <HI>fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I will there, Sir, dedicate all my Time to my fir&s;t Duties; happier far, than once I could have hoped to be! And if, by any Accident, any Mi&s;under|&s;tanding, between you, you &s;hould part by Con&s;ent, and you will have it &s;o, my Heart will be ever yours, and my Hopes will be re&s;um'd of being an

In&s;trument &s;till for your future Good, and I will receive your returning ever valu'd Heart, as if nothing had happen'd, the Moment I can be &s;ure it will be wholly mine.</P>
<P>For, think not, dear Sir, whatever be your Notions of Polygamy, that I will, were my Life to depend upon it, con&s;ent to live with a Gentleman, dear as, God is my Witne&s;s, (lifting up my tearful Eyes) you are to me, who lives in what I cannot but think open Sin with another! You <HI>know,</HI> Sir, and I appeal to you for the Purity, and I will aver Piety, of my Motives, when I &s;ay this, that I <HI>would not</HI>; and as you do know this, I cannot doubt, but my Propo&s;al will be agreeable to you both. And I beg of you, dear Sir, to take me at my Word! and don't let me be tortur'd, as I have been &s;o many Weeks, with &s;uch Angui&s;h of Mind, that nothing but reli|gious Con&s;iderations can make &s;upportable to me.</P>
<P>And are you in Earne&s;t, <HI>Pamela?</HI> &s;aid the dear Gentleman, coming to me, and folding me in his Arms over the Chair's Back, the Seat of which &s;up|ported my trembling Knees &mdash; Can you &s;o ea&s;ily part with me?</P>
<P>I can, Sir, and I will! &mdash; rather than divide my Intere&s;t in you, knowingly, with any Lady on Earth. But &s;ay not, however, Can I part with you, Sir; it is you that part with me; And tell me, Sir, tell me, but what you had intended &s;hould become of me?</P>
<P>You talk to me, my deare&s;t Life, as if all you had heard again&s;t me was true; and you would have me an&s;wer you, (would you?) as if it was?</P>
<P>I want nothing to convince me, Sir, that the Counte&s;s loves you: You know the re&s;t of my Information: Judge for me, what I can, what I ought to believe! &mdash; You know the Rumours of the World concerning you: Even I, who &s;tay &s;o much at home, and have not taken the lea&s;t Pains to find

out my Wretchedne&s;s, nor to confirm it, &s;ince I knew it, have come to the Hearing of it; and if you know the Licen&s;e taken with both your Cha|racters, and yet corre&s;pond &s;o openly, mu&s;t it not look to me, that you value not your Honour in the World's Eye, nor my Lady hers? I told you, Sir, the An&s;wer &s;he made to her Uncle.</P>
<P>You told me, my Dear, as you were told. Be tender of a Lady's Reputation &mdash; for your own &s;ake. No one is exempted from Calumny; and even Words &s;aid, and the Occa&s;ion of &s;aying them not known, may bear a very different Con&s;truction from what they would have done, had the Occa&s;ion been told.</P>
<P>This may be all true, Sir: I wi&s;h my Lady would be as tender of her Reputation as I would be, let her injure me in your Affections as &s;he will. But can you &s;ay, Sir, that there is nothing between you, that &s;hould <HI>not</HI> be, according to <HI>my</HI> Notions of Virtue and Honour, and according to your <HI>own,</HI> Sir, which I took Pride in, before that fatal Ma|&s;querade?</P>
<P>You an&s;wer me not, continu'd I; and may I not fairly pre&s;ume you are not able to an&s;wer me as I wi&s;h to be an&s;wer'd? But come, deare&s;t Sir, (and I put my Arms round his Neck) let me not urge you too boldly. I will never forget your Benefits and your pa&s;t Kindne&s;s to me. I have been a happy Creature; no one, till within the&s;e few Weeks, was ever &s;o happy as I. I will love you &s;till with a Pa&s;&s;ion as ardent as ever I loved you. Ab&s;ence cannot le&s;&s;en &s;uch a Love as mine: I am &s;ure it cannot.</P>
<P>I &s;ee your Difficulties. You have gone too far to recede. If you can make it ea&s;y to your Con|&s;cience, I will wait with Patience my happier De&s;tiny; and I will wi&s;h to live, (if I can be con|vinc'd
<PB N="212" REF="213">
you wi&s;h me not to die) in order to pray for you, and to be a Directre&s;s to the fir&s;t Educa|tion of my deare&s;t Baby.</P>
<P>You &s;igh, dear Sir; repo&s;e your beloved Face next to my fond Heart. 'Tis all your own: And ever &s;hall be, let it be worthy of the Honour in your E&s;timation or not.</P>
<P>But, yet, my dear Sir, if one could as ea&s;ily, in the Prime of &s;en&s;ual Youth, look Twenty Years forward, as one can Twenty Years backward, what an empty Vanity, what a mere Nothing, will be all tho&s;e gro&s;&s;er Satisfactions, that now give Wings of De&s;ire to our deba&s;ed Appetites?</P>
<P>Motives of Religion <HI>will</HI> have their due Force upon <HI>your</HI> Mind one Day, I hope; as, ble&s;&s;ed be God, they have inabled <HI>me</HI> to talk to you on &s;uch a touching Point (after infinite Struggles, I own) with &s;o much Temper and Re&s;ignation; and then, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> when we come to that la&s;t Bed, from which the Pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of our Friends &s;hall lift us, but from which, we &s;hall never be able to rai&s;e our|&s;elves; for, dear Sir, your Counte&s;s, and you, and your poor <HI>Pamela,</HI> mu&s;t all come to this! &mdash; we &s;hall find what it is will give us the true Joy, and inable us to &s;upport the Pangs of the dying Hour.&mdash;Think you, my deare&s;t Sir, and I pre&s;&s;ed my Lips to his Forehead, as his Head was reclin'd on my throbbing Bo&s;om, that <HI>then,</HI> in that important Moment, what now gives us &s;o much Plea&s;ure, will have any Part in our Con&s;ideration, but as it may give us Woe or Comfort in the Reflection?</P>
<P>But, I will not, I will not, O be&s;t Beloved of my Soul, thus afflict you!&mdash;Why &s;hould I thus &s;adden all your gaudy Pro&s;pects? I have &s;aid enough to &s;uch a Heart as yours, if Divine Grace touches it. And if not, all I can &s;ay, will be of no Avail!&mdash;I will leave you therefore to That, and to your own
<PB N="213" REF="214">
Reflections. And after giving you ten thou&s;and Thanks for your kind, your indulgent Patience with me, I will only beg, that I may &s;et out in a Week for <HI>Kent,</HI> with my dear <HI>Billy</HI>; that you will receive one Letter from me, at lea&s;t, of Gratitude and Ble&s;|&s;ings; it &s;hall not be of Upbraidings and Exclamations.</P>
<P>But my Child you mu&s;t not deny me; for I &s;hall haunt, like his Shadow, every Place wherein you &s;hall put my <HI>Billy,</HI> if you &s;hould be &s;o unkind to deny him to me!&mdash;And if, moreover, you will permit me to have the dear Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI> with me, as you had almo&s;t given me room to hope, I will read over all the Books of Education, and dige&s;t them as well as I am able, in order to &s;end you my Scheme, and to &s;hew you how fit I hope your <HI>Indulgence,</HI> at lea&s;t, will make you think me, of having two &s;uch precious Tru&s;ts repo&s;ed in me!</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent, waiting in Tears his An&s;wer. But his generous Heart was touch'd, and &s;eem'd to labour within him for Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He came round to me at la&s;t, and took me in his Arms: Exalted Genero&s;ity! &s;aid he, Noble-minded <HI>Pamela!</HI> Let no Bar be put between us hence|forth! No Wonder, when one looks back to thy fir&s;t promi&s;ing Dawn of Excellence, that thy fuller Day &s;hould thus irre&s;i&s;tibly dazzle &s;uch weak Eyes as mine. Whatever it co&s;ts me, and I have been incon&s;iderately led on by blind Pa&s;&s;ion for an Object too charming, but which I never thought equal to my <HI>Pamela,</HI> I will (for it is yet, I ble&s;s God, in my Power) re&s;tore to your Virtue an Husband all your own.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, Sir, (and I &s;hould have &s;unk down with Joy, had not his kind Arms &s;upported me) what have you &s;aid?&mdash;Can I be &s;o happy as to behold you innocent as to Deed; God, of his infinite Good|ne&s;s, continue you both &s;o!&mdash;And Oh! that the dear Lady would make me as truly love her, for the

Graces of her Mind, as I admire her for the Advan|tages of her Per&s;on!</P>
<P>You are Virtue it&s;elf, my deare&s;t Life; and from this Moment I will reverence you as my tutelary Angel. I &s;hall behold you with Awe, and implicitly give up my&s;elf to all your Dictates; for what you <HI>&s;ay,</HI> and what you <HI>do,</HI> mu&s;t be ever right.&mdash;But I will not, my deare&s;t Life, too lavi&s;hly promi&s;e, le&s;t you &s;hould think it the &s;udden Effect of Pa&s;&s;ions thus movingly touch'd, and which may &s;ub&s;ide again, when the Soul, as you ob&s;erv'd in your own Ca&s;e, &s;inks to its former Level: But this I promi&s;e you, (and I hope you believe me, and will pardon the Pain I have given you, which made me fear, more than once, that your dear Head was affected, &s;o uncommon, yet &s;o like your&s;elf, has been the man|ner of your Acting) that I will break off a Corre|&s;pondence, that has given you &s;o much Unea&s;ine&s;s; And my <HI>Pamela</HI> may believe, that if I can be as good as my Word in this Point, &s;he will never more be in Danger of any Rivale&s;s whatever.</P>
<P>But &s;ay, my dear Love, (added the charming, charming Man) &s;ay you forgive me; and re&s;ume but your former Chearfulne&s;s, and affectionate Regards to me; el&s;e I &s;hall &s;u&s;pect the Sincerity of your Forgive|ne&s;s: And you &s;hall indeed go to <HI>Kent</HI>; but not without me, nor your Boy neither; and if you in&s;i&s;t upon it, the poor Mi&s;s, you have wi&s;h'd &s;o often, and &s;o generou&s;ly to have, &s;hall be given up ab&s;o|lutely to your Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>Do you think, my Lady, I could &s;peak any one di&s;tinct Sentence! No indeed I could not&mdash;Pardon! Pardon <HI>You,</HI> dear Sir!&mdash;and I &s;unk down on my Knees, from his Arms&mdash;All I beg&mdash;All I hope&mdash; <HI>Your</HI> Pardon&mdash;<HI>my</HI> Thankfulne&s;s.&mdash;O &s;pare me&mdash; &s;pare me but Words&mdash;And indeed I was ju&s;t choak'd with my Joy; I never was &s;o in my whole

<P>We were forced to &s;eparate &s;oon after; for there was no bearing each other, &s;o exce&s;&s;ive was my Joy, and his Goodne&s;&s;s. He left me, and went down to his own Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Judge my Imployment you will, I am &s;ure, my dear Lady. I had new Ec&s;ta&s;y to be ble&s;t with, in a Joy and Thankfulne&s;s &s;o exalted, that they left me all light and plea&s;ant, as if I had &s;hook off Body, and trod in Air; &s;o much Heavine&s;s had I lo&s;t, and &s;o much Joy had I received! From two &s;uch Extremes, how was it po&s;&s;ible I could pre&s;ently hit the Medium!&mdash;For when I had given up my beloved Husband, as lo&s;t to me, and had dreaded the Con&s;equences to his future State; to find him not only untainted as to Deed, but, in all Probability, mine upon better and &s;urer Terms than ever&mdash;O, Madam! is not this a Joy beyond all Joy, and &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing all Expre&s;&s;ion!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR joyful Corre&s;pondent has obtained Leave to get every thing ready to quit <HI>London</HI> by <HI>Friday</HI> next, when your kind' Brother promi&s;es to
<PB N="219" REF="220">
carry me down to <HI>Kent,</HI> and allows me to take my Charmer with me. There's Happine&s;s for you, Madam! To &s;ee, as I hope I &s;hall &s;ee, upon one ble&s;&s;ed Spot, a dear faithful Husband, a beloved Child, and a Father and Mother whom I &s;o much love and honour!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> told me this voluntarily, this Morn|ing at Breakfa&s;t; and then, in the kinde&s;t man|ner, he took Leave of me, and &s;et out for <HI>Bedford|&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>But I &s;hould, according to my Promi&s;e, give your Lady&s;hip a few Particulars of our Breakfa&s;t Conference.</P>
<P>I bid <HI>Polly</HI> withdraw, when her Ma&s;ter came up to Breakfa&s;t; and I ran to the Door to meet him, and threw my&s;elf on my Knees: O forgive me, deare&s;t, dear Sir, all my Boldne&s;s of Ye&s;terday!&mdash; My Heart was &s;trangely affected&mdash;or I could not have acted as I did. But never fear, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that my future Conduct &s;hall be different from what it u&s;ed to be, or that I &s;hall keep up to a Spirit, that you hardly thought had Place in the Heart of your dutiful <HI>Pamela,</HI> till &s;he was thus &s;everely try'd.</P>
<P>I have weigh'd well your Conduct, my dear Life, &s;aid the generous Gentleman, rai&s;ing me to his Bo|&s;om; and I find an Uniformity in it, that is &s;ur|pri&s;ingly ju&s;t.</P>
<P>There is in your Compo&s;ition indeed, the &s;trange&s;t Mixture of Meekne&s;s and high Spirit, that ever I met with. Never was a &s;aucier dear Girl, than you, in your Maiden Days, when you thought your Honour in Danger: Never a more conde&s;cending Goodne&s;s, when your Fears were at an End. Now again, when you had Rea&s;on, as you believ'd, to apprehend a Conduct in me, un|worthy
<PB N="220" REF="221">
of my Obligations to you, and of your Pu|rity, you ri&s;e in your Spirit, with a Dignity that becomes an injured Per&s;on; and yet you forget not, in the Height of your Re&s;entments, that angelick Sweetne&s;s of Temper, and Readine&s;s to forgive, which &s;o well become a Lady who lives as you live, and practi&s;es what you practi&s;e. My deare&s;t <HI>Pa|mela,</HI> I &s;ee, continued he, &s;erves not GOD for nought: In a better Sen&s;e I &s;peak it, than the Ma|ligner &s;poke it of <HI>Job:</HI> Since in every Action and Motion of yours, the heavenly Direction you &s;o con&s;tantly invoke, &s;hews it&s;elf thus beautifully.</P>
<P>And now again, this charming Conde&s;cen&s;ion, the Moment you are made ea&s;y, is an A&s;&s;urance that your affectionate Sweetne&s;s is return'd: And I cannot fear any thing, but that I &s;hall never be able to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>He led me to the Tea-Table, and &s;at down clo&s;e by me. <HI>Polly</HI> came in. If every thing, &s;aid he, be here, that your Lady wants, you may withdraw; and let Mr. <HI>Colbrand</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> know, I &s;hall be with them pre&s;ently. Nobody &s;hall wait upon me but you, my Dear.</P>
<P><HI>Polly</HI> withdrew.</P>
<P>You are all Goodne&s;s, Sir: And how generou&s;ly, how kindly, do you account for that Mixture in my Temper you &s;peak of!&mdash;Depend upon it, dear Sir, that I will never grow upon this your Indul|gence.</P>
<P>I always <HI>lov'd</HI> you, my Deare&s;t, &s;aid he, and that with a pa&s;&s;ionate Fondne&s;s, which has not, I dare &s;ay, many Examples in the marry'd Life: But I revere you now. And &s;o great is my Reverence for your Virtue, that I cho&s;e to &s;it up all Night, as now to leave you for a few Days, until, by di&s;in|gaging my&s;elf from all Intercour&s;es that have given
<PB N="221" REF="222">
you Unea&s;ine&s;s, I can convince you, that I have render'd my&s;elf as worthy as I can be of &s;uch an An|gel, even upon your own Terms. I will account to you, continued he, for every Step I <HI>&s;hall</HI> take, and will reveal to you every Step I <HI>have</HI> taken: For this I can do, becau&s;e the Lady's Honour is un|tainted, and wicked Rumour has treated her wor&s;e than &s;he could de&s;erve.</P>
<P>I told him, that &s;ince <HI>he</HI> had been plea&s;ed to name my Lady, I would take the Liberty to &s;ay, I was glad, for her own &s;ake, to hear that. He changing the Subject a little precipitately, as if it gave him Pain, told me, as above, that I might prepare on <HI>Friday</HI> for <HI>Kent</HI>; and I parted with him, with greater Joy and Gratitude than ever I did in my Life. So nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes are Affli|ctions, not only to teach one how to &s;ubdue one's Pa&s;&s;ions, and to make us, in our happie&s;t States, know we are &s;till on Earth, but even when they are ever-blown, to augment and redouble our Joys.</P>
<P>I am now giving Orders, my dear Lady, for my beloved Journey, and quitting this undelightful Town, as it has been, and is, to me. My next will be from <HI>Kent,</HI> I hope; and perhaps I &s;hall then have an Opportunity to acquaint your Lady&s;hip with the Particulars, and (if GOD an&s;wers my Prayers) the Conclu&s;ion of the Affair, which has given me &s;o much Unea&s;ine&s;s.

<P>INclo&s;ed are all the Letters you &s;end for.

<P>What Care ought the&s;e young Widows to take of their Reputation?&mdash;And how watchful ought they to be over them&s;elves?&mdash;She was hardly out of her Weeds, and yet mu&s;t go to a Ma&s;querade, and tempt her Fate, with all her Pa&s;&s;ions about her, with an Independence, and an Affluence of Fortune, that made her able to think of nothing but gratifying them.</P>
<P>Then her Lord and &s;he had been marry'd but barely Two Years; and one of them, &s;he was forc'd, with the gaye&s;t Temper in the World, to be his Nur&s;e: For, always inclin'd to a con&s;umptive In|di&s;po&s;ition, he langui&s;h'd, without Hope, a Twelve|month, and then dy'd.</P>
<P>She has good Qualities&mdash;is generous&mdash;noble&mdash;but has &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions, and is thoughtle&s;s and precipi|tant.</P>
<P>My Lord came home to me la&s;t <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> with a long Story of my Brother and her; for I had kept the Matter as &s;ecret as I could, for his &s;ake and

I hope &s;he is innocent, as to Fact; but I know not what to &s;ay to it. He ought to be hang'd, if he did not &s;ay &s;he was. Yet I have a great Opinion of his Veracity: And yet he is &s;o bold a Wretch!&mdash;And her Incon|&s;ideration is &s;o great!&mdash;</P>
<P>But le&s;t I &s;hould alarm your Fears, I will wait till I have the Account he gives you of this dark Affair; till when, I congratulate you upon the Leave you have obtain'd to quit the Town, and on your &s;etting out for a Place &s;o much nearer to <HI>Tunbriige</HI> (forgive me, <HI>Pamela</HI>; but he is an intriguing Wretch, and I would not have you to be too &s;ecure, le&s;t the Di&s;ap|pointment &s;hould be wor&s;e for you, than what you knew before): For as&s;ure your&s;elf, that I am, in all Ca&s;es and Events,</P>

<P>Your Lady&s;hip mu&s;t needs think, how much we were all overjoy'd at this Meeting: For my own Part, I cannot expre&s;s how much I was tran&s;ported when we arrived at the Farm-hou&s;e, to &s;ee all I de|lighted in, upon one happy Spot together!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is much plea&s;ed with the Alterations made here<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. III. <HI>Letter</HI> I.</NOTE>, and it is a &s;weet, rural, and convenient Place.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="226">We were at Church together on <HI>Sunday,</HI> and welcom'd into the&s;e Parts by the Bells, and by the Mini&s;ter, and the People of mo&s;t Note.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is to &s;et out on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> for <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> with my Papers. A happy I&s;&s;ue attend that Affair, I pray GOD! He has given me the following Parti|culars of it, to the Time of my Trial, beginning at the Ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, That at the Ma&s;querade, when, plea&s;ed with the fair Nun's Shape, Air, and Voice, he had followed her to a Corner mo&s;t unob&s;erved, &s;he &s;aid, in <HI>Italian,</HI> Why are my Retirements invaded, au|dacious <HI>Spaniard?</HI></P>
<P>Becau&s;e, reply'd he, my dear Nun, I hope you would have it &s;o.</P>
<P>I can no otherwi&s;e, return'd &s;he, &s;trike dead thy bold Pre&s;umption, than to &s;hew thee my Scorn and Anger thus&mdash;And unma&s;king, &s;he &s;urpris'd me, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> with a Face as beautiful, but not &s;o &s;oft, as my <HI>Pamela</HI>'s!&mdash;And I, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to &s;hew I can defy your Re&s;entment, will &s;hew you a Countenance as intrepid, as yours is lovely. And &s;o he drew a&s;ide his Ma&s;k too.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, he ob&s;erved his fair Nun followed, where|ever &s;he went, by a Ma&s;k habited like <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> in <HI>Sir Courtly Nice,</HI> who&s;e Attention was fixed upon them; and he doubted not, that it was Mr. <HI>Turner.</HI> So he and the fair Nun, took different Ways, and he joined me and Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> and found me in|gag'd in the manner I related to your Lady&s;hip; and his Nun at his Elbow, unexpected.</P>
<P>That afterwards, as he was ingag'd in <HI>French</HI> with a Lady who had the Dre&s;s of an <HI>Indian</HI> Prin|ce&s;s, and the Ma&s;k of an <HI>Ethiopian,</HI> his fair Nun

&s;aid, in broken <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> Art thou at all Comple|ctions?&mdash;By St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> I believe thou'rt a Rover!</P>
<P>I am trying, reply'd he, in <HI>Italian,</HI> whether I can meet with any Lady comparable to my lovely Nun.</P>
<P>And what is the Re&s;ult?</P>
<P>Not one; no, not one.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you could not help being in Earne&s;t, &s;aid &s;he; and &s;lid from him.</P>
<P>He ingag'd her next at the Side-board, drinking under her Veil a Gla&s;s of Champaign. You know, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he, there never was a &s;weeter Mouth in the World, than the Counte&s;s's, except your own. She drew away the Gla&s;s, as if, unob&s;erved by any body, to &s;hew me the lower Part of her Face.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, continued he, but I was &s;truck with her charming Manner, and an Unre&s;ervedne&s;s of Air and Behaviour, that I had not before &s;een &s;o becom|ing.&mdash;The Place, and the Freedom of Conver&s;ation and Deportment allowed there, gave her Manner great Advantages, in my Eye, altho' her Habit re|quir'd, as I thought, continued he, a little more Gravity and Circum&s;pection: And I could not tell how to re&s;i&s;t a &s;ecret Pride and Vanity, which is but too natural to both Sexes, when they are taken no|tice of by Per&s;ons &s;o worthy of Regard.</P>
<P>Naturally fond of any thing that carry'd the Face of an Intrigue, I long'd to know, proceeded he, who this charming Nun was.&mdash;And next Time I in|gag'd her, My good Si&s;ter, &s;aid I, how happy &s;hould I be, if I might be admitted to a Conver&s;ation with you at your Grate?</P>
<P>An&s;wer me, thou bold <HI>Spaniard,</HI> (for that was a Name &s;he &s;eem'd fond to call me by, &s;aid he, which
<PB N="227" REF="228">
gave me to imagine, that Boldne&s;s was a Qualifica|tion with which &s;he was not di&s;plea&s;ed: 'Tis not unu&s;ual with our vain Sex, ob&s;erved he, to con&s;true even Reproaches to our Advantage) Is the Lady here, who&s;e Shackles thou weare&s;t?</P>
<P>Do I look like a Man &s;hackled, my faire&s;t Nun?</P>
<P>N&mdash;No! not much like &s;uch an one. But I fan&s;y thy Wife is either a <HI>Widow,</HI> or a <HI>Quaker</HI>?</P>
<P>Neither, reply'd I, taking, by Equivocation, her Que&s;tion literally.</P>
<P>And art thou not a marry'd Wretch? An&s;wer me quickly!&mdash;We are ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>No&mdash;&s;aid I.</P>
<P>Swear to me, thou art not.&mdash;</P>
<P>By St. <HI>Ignatius</HI> then: For, my Dear, I was no <HI>Wretch,</HI> you know.</P>
<P>Enough! &s;aid &s;he&mdash;and &s;lid away; and the Fana|tick would fain have ingag'd her, but &s;he avoided him as indu&s;triou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Before I was aware, continued Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;he was at my Elbow, and, in <HI>Italian,</HI> &s;aid, That fair Quaker yonder is the Wit of the A&s;&s;embl&eacute;e: Her Eyes &s;eem always directed to thy Motions: And her Per&s;on &s;hews &s;ome Intimacies have pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ome|body It is with thee?</P>
<P>It would be my Glory if it was, &s;aid I, were her Face an&s;werable to her Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Is it not?</P>
<P>I long to know, reply'd Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>I am glad thou do&s;t not.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear my fair Nun &s;ay that.</P>
<P>Do&s;t thou, &s;aid &s;he, hate Shackles? Or is it, that thy Hour is not come?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h! reply'd he, this be not the Hour, the very Hour&mdash;pretending (naughty Gentleman!&mdash; What Ways the&s;e Men have!&mdash;) to &s;igh.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="229">She went again to the Side-board, put her Hand kerchief upon it. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> followed her, and ob|&s;erved all her Motions. She drank a Gla&s;s of Le|monade, as he of Burgundy; and a Per&s;on in a Domine, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the King, taking every one's Attention, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> eying her Hand|kerchief, which he doubted not &s;he laid on purpo&s;e to forget taking up, &s;he left it there; and &s;lipping by him, he, unob&s;erv'd, as he believes, took it, and put it in his Pocket, and at one Corner found the Cover of a Letter, To the Right Honourable the Counte&s;s Dowager of &mdash;.</P>
<P>That after this, the fair Nun was &s;o &s;hy, &s;o re|&s;erv'd, and &s;eem'd &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid him, that he had no Opportunity to return her Handkerchief; and the Fanatick ob&s;erving how &s;he &s;hunned him, &s;aid, in <HI>French,</HI> What, Mon&s;ieur, have you done to your Nun?</P>
<P>Found her to be a very Coquet; and told her &s;o &mdash;and &s;he is offended.</P>
<P>How could you affront a Lady, reply'd he, with &s;uch a <HI>charming Face?</HI></P>
<P>By that, I had Rea&s;on to think, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that he had &s;een her unma&s;k; and I &s;aid&mdash;It be|comes not any Character, but that you wear, to pry into the Secrets of others, in order to make ill-natur'd Remarks, and perhaps to take ungentle|manly Advantages.</P>
<P>No Man would make that Ob&s;ervation, return'd he, who&s;e Views would bear prying into.</P>
<P>I was nettled, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> at this warm Retort, and drew a&s;ide my Ma&s;k: Nor would any Man, who wore not a Ma&s;k, tell me &s;o!</P>
<P>He took not the Challenge, and &s;lid from me, and I &s;aw him no more that Night.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="230">So, thinks I, another In&s;tance this might have been of the glorious Con&s;equences of Ma&s;querading. &mdash;O my Lady, the&s;e Ma&s;querades are abominable Things!&mdash;</P>
<P>The King, they &s;aid, met with a free Speaker that Night: In Truth, I was not very &s;orry for it; for if Monarchs will lay a&s;ide their &s;overeign Di&s;tin|ctions, and mingle, thus in Ma&s;querade with the wor&s;t as well as the highe&s;t (I cannot &s;ay <HI>be&s;t</HI>) of their Subjects, let 'em take the Con&s;equence.&mdash;Per|haps they might have a Chance to hear more Truth here than in their Palaces&mdash;the only Good that po&s;|&s;ibly can accrue from them&mdash;that is to &s;ay&mdash;If they made a good U&s;e of it when they heard it. For, you &s;ee, my Monarch, tho' told the Truth, as it happened, received the Hint with more Re&s;entment than Thankfulne&s;s!&mdash;So, 'tis too likely, did the Monarch of us both!</P>
<P>And now, my Lady, you need not doubt, that &s;o polite a Gentleman would find an Opportunity to return the Nun her Handkerchief!&mdash;To be &s;ure he would: For what Man of Honour would rob a Lady of any Part of her Apparel? And &s;hould he that wanted to &s;teal a Heart, content him&s;elf with a Handkerchief?&mdash;No, no, that was not to be ex|pected.&mdash;So what does he do, but, the very next Day, after Dinner, the &s;oone&s;t Opportunity he could well take, becau&s;e of the late Hours the Night before, re&s;olve to pur&s;ue this Affair! Accordingly, the poor Quaker little thinking of the Matter, away goes her naughty <HI>Spaniard,</HI> to find out his Nun at her Grate, or in her Parlour rather.</P>
<P>He a&s;ks for the Counte&s;s. Is admitted into the outward Parlour&mdash;Her Woman comes down; re|quires his Name, and Bu&s;ine&s;s. His Name he men|tioned not. His Bu&s;ine&s;s was, to re&s;tore into her

Lady's own Hands, &s;omething &s;he had dropt the Night before.&mdash;Was de&s;ir'd to wait.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told your Lady&s;hip, that he was dre&s;s'd very richly&mdash;having no De&s;ign at all, to make Conque&s;ts; no, not he!&mdash;O this wicked Love of Intrigue!&mdash;A kind of Olive-colour'd Velvet, and fine brocaded Wai&s;tcoat. I &s;aid, when he took Leave of me, You're a charming Mr. <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;and &s;a|luted him, more pre&s;&s;ingly than he return'd it; but little did I think, when I plaited &s;o &s;mooth his rich-lac'd Ruffles, and Bo&s;om, where he was going, or what he had in his plotting Heart.&mdash;He went in his own Chariot, that he did: So that he had no De&s;ign to conceal who he was&mdash;But Intrigue, a new Con|que&s;t, Vanity, Pride!&mdash;O the&s;e Men!&mdash;They had need talk of Ladies!&mdash;But it is half our own Fault; indeed it is, to incourage their Vanity!</P>
<P>Well, Madam, he waited till his Stateline&s;s was moved to &s;end up again, That he would wait on her Lady&s;hip &s;ome other Time.&mdash;So down &s;he came, dre&s;s'd mo&s;t richly, Jewels in her Brea&s;t, and in her Hair, and Ears&mdash;But with a very re&s;erved and &s;tately Air&mdash;He approached her&mdash;Methinks I &s;ee him, dear &s;aucy Gentleman. You know, Madam, what a noble manner of Addre&s;s he has!</P>
<P>He took the Handkerchief, from his Bo&s;om, with an Air; and ki&s;&s;ing it, pre&s;ented it to her, &s;aying, This happy E&s;tray, thus re&s;tor'd, begs Leave, by me, to acknowlege its lovely Owner!</P>
<P>What mean you, Sir?&mdash;Who be you, Sir?&mdash; What mean you?</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip will excu&s;e me: But I am inca|pable of meaning any thing but what is honourable. &mdash;(No to be &s;ure!)&mdash;This, Madam, you left la&s;t Night, when the Domine took up every one's At|tention

but mine, which was much better ingag'd; and I take the Liberty to re&s;tore it to you.</P>
<P>She turn'd to the Mark; a Coronet, at one Cor|ner. 'Tis true, Sir, I &s;ee now it is one of mine: But &s;uch a Trifle was not worthy of being brought by &s;uch a Gentleman as you &s;eem to be; nor of my Trouble to receive it in Per&s;on. Your Servant, Sir, might have delivered the Bagatelle to mine.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;hould be called &s;o, that belongs to the Counte&s;s of &mdash;.</P>
<P>She was no Counte&s;s, Sir, that <HI>dropt</HI> that Hand|kerchief; and a Gentleman would not attempt to penetrate <HI>unbecomingly,</HI> thro' the Di&s;gui&s;es that a Lady thinks proper to a&s;&s;ume, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a Place, where every Inquiry &s;hould begin and end.</P>
<P>This, Madam, from a Lady, who had unma&s;ked &mdash;becau&s;e <HI>&s;he would not be known!</HI>&mdash;Very pretty, indeed!&mdash;Oh! the&s;e &s;light Cobweb Airs of Mode&s;ty! &s;o ea&s;ily &s;een thro'&mdash;Hence &s;uch Advantages again&s;t us are taken by the Men.</P>
<P>She had looked out of her Window, and &s;een no Arms quartered with his own; for you know my Lady, I would never permit any to be procured for me: So, &s;he doubted not, it &s;eems, but he was an unmarried Gentleman, as he had intimated to her the Night before.</P>
<P>He told her, it was impo&s;&s;ible, after having had the Opportunity of &s;eeing the fine&s;t Lady in the World, not to wi&s;h to &s;ee her again; and that he hop'd, he did not, <HI>unbecomingly,</HI> break thro' her Lady&s;hip's Re&s;erves: Nor had he made any Inqui|ries either on the Spot, or off of it; having had a much better Direction by Accident.</P>
<P>As how, Sir? &s;aid &s;he, as he told me, with &s;o bewitching an Air, between Attentive and Plea&s;ant, that, bold Gentleman, forgetting all manner of Di|&s;tance,
<PB N="232" REF="233">
&s;o early too! he cla&s;ped his Arms round her Wai&s;t, and &s;aluted her, &s;truggling with Anger and Indignation, he &s;ays: But I think little of that!&mdash;</P>
<P>Whence this In&s;olence?&mdash;How-now, Sir!&mdash;Be|gone! were her Words, and &s;he rung the Bell; but he &s;et his Back again&s;t the Door&mdash;(I never heard &s;uch Boldne&s;s in my Life, Madam!)&mdash;till &s;he would forgive him.&mdash;And it is plain, &s;he was not &s;o angry as &s;he pretended; for her Woman coming, &s;he was calmer: <HI>Nelthorpe,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, fetch my Snuff-box, with the Lavender in it.</P>
<P>Her Woman went; and then &s;he &s;aid, You told me, Sir, la&s;t Night, of your Intrepidne&s;s: I think you are the bolde&s;t Man I ever met with: But, Sir, &s;urely you ought to know, that you are not now in the <HI>Hay-market.</HI></P>
<P>I think, truly, Madam, the Lady might have &s;av'd her&s;elf that Speech; for, upon my Word, they neither of 'em wore Ma&s;ks&mdash;Tho' they ought both to have put on one of Blu&s;hes.&mdash;I am &s;ure I do for 'em, while I am writing.</P>
<P>Her irre&s;i&s;tible Loveline&s;s &s;erved for an Excu&s;e, that &s;he could not di&s;approve from a Man &s;he di&s;|liked not; and his irre&s;i&s;tible&mdash;may I &s;ay, A&s;&s;urance, Madam?&mdash;found too ready an Excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Well, but, Sir, &s;aid I, pray, when her Lady&s;hip was made acquainted, that you were a marry'd Gen|tleman, how then?&mdash;I long to hear, how then!&mdash; Pray, did <HI>&s;he</HI> find it out, or did <HI>you</HI> tell her?</P>
<P>Patience, my Dear!</P>
<P>Well, pray, Sir, go on.&mdash;What was next?</P>
<P>Why, next, I put on a more re&s;pectful and ten|der Air: I would have taken her Hand indeed, but &s;he would not permit it; and when &s;he &s;aw I would not go, till her Lavender Snuff came down, (for &s;o I told her, and her Woman was not in Ha&s;te) &s;he
<PB N="233" REF="234">
&s;eated her&s;elf, and I took my Place by her, and be|gan upon a Subject of a charming Lady I &s;aw the Night before, after I had parted with her Lady&s;hip, but not equal by any means to her: And I was con|fident this would ingage her Attention; for I never knew the Lady, who thought her&s;elf hand&s;ome, that was not taken by this Topick. Flattery and Admi|ration, <HI>Pamela,</HI> are the two principal Engines by which our Sex make their fir&s;t Approaches to yours; and if you li&s;ten to us, we are &s;ure, either by the Sap or the Mine, to &s;ucceed, and blow you up, whenever we plea&s;e, if we do but take care to &s;uit our&s;elves to your particular Foibles; or, to carry on the Metaphor, point our Batteries to your weak Side: For the &s;tronge&s;t Fortre&s;&s;es, my Dear, are weaker in one Place than another!&mdash;A fine thing, Sir, &s;aid I, to be &s;o learned a Gentleman!&mdash;I wi&s;h tho' you had always come hone&s;tly by your Know|lege, thought I.</P>
<P>When the Lavender Snuff came down, conti|nued he, we were ingaged in an agreeable Di&s;puta|tion, that I had rai&s;ed on purpo&s;e to excite her Op|po&s;ition, &s;he having all the Advantage in it; and in order to give it up, when &s;he was intent upon it, as a Mark of my Con&s;ideration for her.</P>
<P>I the le&s;s wonder, Sir, &s;aid I, at your Boldne&s;s (pardon the Word!) with &s;uch a Lady, in your fir&s;t Vi&s;it, becau&s;e of her Freedoms, when ma&s;k'd; her Unma&s;king, and her Handkerchief, and Letter-cover. To be &s;ure the Lady, when &s;he &s;aw next Day, &s;uch a fine Gentleman, and &s;uch an hand&s;ome Equipage, had little Rea&s;on, after her other Free|doms, to be &s;o very nice with you, as to decline an in&s;naring Conver&s;ation, calculated on purpo&s;e to in|gage her Attention, and to lengthen out your Vi|&s;it. But did &s;he not a&s;k you, who you were?</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">Her Servants did of mine.&mdash;And her Woman (for I knew all afterwards, when we were better ac|quainted) came, and whi&s;pered her Lady, that I was Mr. <HI>B.</HI> of <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI>; and had an immen&s;e E&s;tate, to which they were &s;o kind as to add two or three thou&s;and Pounds a Year, out of pure Good|will to me: I thank them.</P>
<P>But pray, dear Sir, what had you in View in all this? Did you intend to carry this Matter at fir&s;t, as far as ever you could?</P>
<P>I had, at fir&s;t, my Dear, no View, but &s;uch as Pride and Vanity &s;ugge&s;ted to me. I was carried away by Incon&s;ideration, and the Love of Intrigue, without &s;o much as giving my&s;elf any Thought about the Con&s;equences. The Lady, I ob&s;erved, had abundance of fine Qualities. I thought I could con|ver&s;e with her, on a very agreeable Foot; and her Honour, I knew, at any Time, would pre&s;erve me mine, if ever I &s;hould find it in Danger: And, in my Soul, I preferr'd my <HI>Pamela</HI> to all the Ladies on Earth, and que&s;tioned not, but that, and your Virtue, would be another Barrier to my Fidelity.</P>
<P>As to the Notion of <HI>Polygamy,</HI> I never, but in the Levity of Speech, and the Wantonne&s;s of Argu|ment, like other lively young Fellows, who think they have Wit to &s;hew, when they advance &s;ome|thing out of the common way, had it in my Head. I thought my&s;elf doubly bound by the Laws of my Country, to di&s;courage that way of Thinking, as I was a Five hundredth Part of one of the Branches of the Legi&s;lature; and incon&s;iderable as that is, yet it makes one too con&s;iderable, in my Opinion, to break tho&s;e Laws, one &s;hould rather join all one's Intere&s;t to inforce.</P>
<P>In a Word, therefore, Pride, Vanity, Thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, were my Mi&s;guiders, as I &s;aid. The Coun|te&s;s's
<PB N="235" REF="236">
Honour and Character, and your Virtue and Merit, my Dear, and my Obligations to you, were my Defences: But I find one &s;hould avoid the fir&s;t Appearances of Evil. One knows not one's own Strength. 'Tis pre&s;umptuous to depend upon it, where Wit and Beauty are in the Way on one Side, and Youth and &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions on the other.</P>
<P>You certainly, Sir, &s;ay right. But be plea&s;ed to tell me, what her Lady&s;hip &s;aid, when &s;he knew you were marry'd?</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s's Woman was in my Intere&s;t, and let me into &s;ome of her Lady's Secrets, having a great Share in her Confidence; and particularly ac|quainted me, how loth her Lady was to believe I was marry'd. I had paid her three Vi&s;its in Town, and attended her once to her Seat upon the Fore&s;t, before &s;he heard that I was. But when &s;he was a&s;&s;ured of it, and directed her <HI>Nelthorpe</HI> to a&s;k me about it, and I readily own'd it, &s;he was greatly in|cen&s;ed, tho' nothing but general Civilities, and Inti|macies not incon&s;i&s;tent with honourable Friend&s;hip, had pa&s;&s;ed between us. The Con&s;equence was, &s;he forbid me ever &s;eeing her again, and &s;et out with her Si&s;ter, and the Vi&s;count, for <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> where &s;he &s;tay'd about three Weeks.</P>
<P>I thought I had already gone too far, and blamed my&s;elf for permitting her Lady&s;hip &s;o long to believe me a &s;ingle Man; and here the Matter had dropp'd, in all Probability, had not a Ball, given by Lord &mdash;, to which, unknown to each other, we were both, as al&s;o the Vi&s;counte&s;s, invited, brought us again into one another's Company. The Lady withdrew, after a while, with her Si&s;ter, to another Apartment; and being re&s;olved upon per&s;onal Recrimination, (which is what a Lady, who is re&s;olved to break with a favoured Object, &s;hould never tru&s;t her&s;elf with)
<PB N="236" REF="237">
&s;ent for me, and reproached me on my Conduct, in which her Si&s;ter join'd.</P>
<P>I own'd frankly, that it was rather Gaiety than De&s;ign, that made me give Cau&s;e, at the Ma&s;que|rade, for her Lady&s;hip to think I was not marry'd; for that I had a Wife, who had a thou&s;and Excel|lencies, and was my Pride, and my Boa&s;t: That I held it very po&s;&s;ible for a Gentleman and Lady to carry on an innocent and honourable Friend&s;hip, in a <HI>Family</HI> way; and I was &s;ure, when &s;he and her Si&s;ter &s;aw my Spou&s;e, they would not be di&s;plea&s;ed with her Acquaintance; and all that I had to re|proach my&s;elf with, was, that after having, at the Ma&s;querade, given Rea&s;on to think I was not mar|ry'd, I had been loth, <HI>officiou&s;ly,</HI> to &s;ay I was, altho' it never was my Intention to conceal it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I acquitted my&s;elf &s;o well to both La|dies, that a Family Intimacy was con&s;ented to.</P>
<P>I renew'd my Vi&s;its, and we accounted to one another's Honour, by entering upon a kind of <HI>Plato|nick</HI> Sy&s;tem, in which Sex was to have no manner of Concern.</P>
<P>But, my dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> I mu&s;t own my&s;elf ex|tremely blameable, becau&s;e I knew the World, and human Nature, I will &s;ay, better than the Lady, who never before had been tru&s;ted into it upon her own Feet; and who, notwith&s;tanding that Wit and Vivacity which every one admires in her, gave her|&s;elf little Time for Con&s;ideration, as &s;he had met with a Man who&s;e Per&s;on and Conver&s;ation &s;he did not di&s;like, and who&s;e Circum&s;tances and Spirit &s;et him above &s;ordid or mercenary Views: And be&s;ides, I made my&s;elf u&s;eful to her in &s;ome of her Affairs, wherein &s;he had been gro&s;ly abu&s;ed; which brought us into more intimate and frequent Conver&s;ations, than otherwi&s;e we &s;hould have had Opportunities for.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238">I ought therefore to have more carefully guarded again&s;t Inconveniencies, that I knew were &s;o likely to ari&s;e from &s;uch Intimacies; and the rather, as I hinted, becau&s;e the Lady had no Apprehen&s;ion at all of any: So that, my Dear, if I have no Excu&s;e from human Frailty, from Youth, and the Charms of the Object, I am intirely de&s;titute of any.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, dear Sir, &s;aid I, there is a great deal to be &s;aid for the Lady. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay there was for the Gentleman. But &s;uch a fine Lady had been &s;afe, with all her Incon&s;ideration, and &s;o, forgive me, Sir, would the Gentleman, with all his intrigu|ing Spirit, had it not been for the&s;e vile Ma&s;que|rades. Never, dear Sir, think of going to another.</P>
<P>Why, my Dear, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, tho&s;e are lea&s;t of all to be tru&s;ted at tho&s;e Diver&s;ions, who are mo&s;t de&s;irous to go to them.&mdash;Of this I am now fully convinced.</P>
<P>Well, dear Sir, I long to hear the further Parti|culars of this Story: For this generous Openne&s;s, now the Affair is over, cannot but be grateful to me, as it &s;hews me you have no Re&s;erves; and as it tends to convince me, that the Lady was le&s;s blameable than I apprehended &s;he was: For dearly do I love, for the Honour of my Sex, to find Ladies of Birth and Quality innocent; who have &s;o many Opportunities of knowing and practi&s;ing their Duties, above what meaner Per&s;ons can have&mdash;El&s;e, what <HI>one</HI> fails in thro' Surprize and Ignorance, it will look as if the <HI>others</HI> did from Inclination: And what a Di&s;grace is that upon the Sex in general? And what a Triumph to the wicked ones of yours?</P>
<P>Well ob&s;erved, my Dear: This is like your gene|rous and deep way of Thinking.</P>
<P>Well, but dear Sir, proceed, if you plea&s;e.&mdash; Your Reconciliation is now effected: A Friend&s;hip
<PB N="238" REF="239">
Quadrupartite is commenced. And the Vi&s;counte&s;s and my&s;elf are to find Cement for the erecting of an Edifice, that is to be devoted to <HI>Platonick</HI> Love. What, may I a&s;k, came next? And what did you de&s;ign &s;hould come of it?</P>
<P>The <HI>Oxford</HI> Journey, my Dear, followed next; and it was my Fault, that you made not a Party in it: For both Ladies were very de&s;irous of your Com|pany: But it being about the Time you were going abroad, after your Lying-in, I excu&s;ed you to them. Yet they both long'd to &s;ee you; e&s;pecially, as by this Time, you may believe, they knew all your Story: And be&s;ides, whenever you were mentioned, I always did Ju&s;tice, as well to your Mind, as your Per&s;on; and this, not only for the Sake of Ju&s;tice, but, to &s;ay Truth, becau&s;e it gave the two Si&s;ters, and the Vi&s;count, (who&s;e &s;oftly Character, and his Lady's prudent and re&s;pectful Conduct to him, not|with&s;tanding that, are both &s;o well known) le&s;s Cau&s;e of Su&s;picion, that I had any di&s;honourable De&s;igns upon the Dowager Lady.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> will have it, permit me, my dear Lady, to ob&s;erve, that I have &s;ome Merit, with Re|gard to the re&s;t of my Sex, if I am inabled to reform &s;uch a dangerous Spirit of Intrigue, as your dear Brother po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: And the Hi&s;tory of this Affair from his own Mouth, made me begin to pride my|&s;elf on this Head: For was he not, think you, my Lady, in this Ca&s;e, a &s;ad Gentleman!&mdash;And how deeply was he able to lay his Mi&s;chiefs! And how much had this fine Lady been to be pity'd, had &s;he fallen by his Arts, who was the only Man, almo&s;t, that from the Gracefulne&s;s of his Per&s;on, the Noble|ne&s;s of his Mind, his Genero&s;ity, Courage, ample Fortunes, and Wit, could have made her unhappy! &mdash;GOD be prai&s;ed, that it was &s;topt in Time, tho',
<PB N="239" REF="240">
as it &s;eems, but ju&s;t in Time, as well for the poor Lady's &s;ake, as for Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s, and my own!</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Madam, for this Digre&s;&s;ion. But yet, for what I am going to repeat, I &s;hall &s;till want further Excu&s;e; for I cannot re&s;i&s;t a little ri&s;ing Vanity, upon a Compari&s;on (tho' only as to Features) drawn, by your dear Brother, between the Counte&s;s and me; which, however the Prefer|ence he gives me in it, may be unde&s;erved, yet it cannot but be very agreeable, in this particular Ca&s;e of a Rivalry, to one who takes &s;o much Pride in his good Opinion, and who makes it her chief Study, by all hone&s;t and laudable Means, to pre&s;erve it; but who, el&s;e, I hope, is far from con&s;idering &s;uch a tran&s;itory Advantage, (had I it in as great a De|gree as his kind Fancy imputes to me) but as it de|&s;erves. I will give it, as near as I can, in his own Words:</P>
<P>It may not be altogether ami&s;s, my Dear, now I have mentioned the Ju&s;tice I always did your Cha|racter and Merit, to give you a brief Account of a Compari&s;on, which once the Counte&s;s's Curio&s;ity drew from me, between your Features and hers.</P>
<P>She and I were alone in the Bow-window of her Library, which commands a fine View over <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Fore&s;t, but which View we could not enjoy; for it rain'd, and blew a Hurricane almo&s;t, which, tho' ready dre&s;s'd to go abroad, detain'd us within.</P>
<P>I began a Subject, which never fails to make the wor&s;t of Weather agreeable to a fine Lady; that of prai&s;ing her Beauty, and the Symmetry of her Fea|tures, telling her, how much I thought every grace|ful one in her Face adorn'd the re&s;t, as if they were all form'd to give and receive Advantage from each other. I added, approaching her, as if the more attentively to peru&s;e her fine Face, that I believ'd it
<PB N="240" REF="241">
po&s;&s;ible, from the tran&s;parent Whitene&s;s of her Skin, and the clear Bluene&s;s of her Veins, to di&s;cover the Circulation, without a Micro&s;cope.</P>
<P>Keep your Di&s;tance, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid &s;he. Does your magnifying thus egregiou&s;ly the Graces you im|pute to my outward Form, agree with your <HI>Plato|nick</HI> Scheme? Your Eye, penetrating as you ima|gine it, pierces not deep enough for a <HI>Platonick,</HI> if you cannot look farther than the White and the Blue, and di&s;cover the Circulation of the Spirit; for our Friend&s;hip is all Mind, you know.</P>
<P>True, Madam; but if the Face is the Index of the Mind, when I contemplate yours, I &s;ee and re|vere the Beauties of both in one. And what <HI>Plato|nick</HI> Laws forbid us to do Ju&s;tice to the one, when we admire the other?</P>
<P>Well, &s;it you down, bold Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;it you down, and an&s;wer me a Que&s;tion or two on this Subject, &s;ince you will be always rai&s;ing my Vanity upon it.</P>
<P>I did, &s;aluting her Hand <HI>only</HI> (That was his Word, which I took notice of in the dear <HI>Platonick,</HI> tho' I &s;aid nothing).</P>
<P>Tell me now of a Truth, with all the Charms your too agreeable Flattery gives me, Which is the mo&s;t lovely, your <HI>Pamela,</HI> or my&s;elf?</P>
<P>I told her, you were both inimitable, in a diffe|rent Way.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid &s;he, I give up the Per&s;on and Air in general, becau&s;e I have heard, that &s;he is &s;lenderer, and better &s;hap'd, than mo&s;t Ladies; but for a few Particulars, as to <HI>Face,</HI> (invidious as the Campari|&s;on may be, and concern'd as you are to ju&s;tify your Choice) I'll begin with the <HI>Hair,</HI> Mr. <HI>B.</HI> Who&s;e HAIR is of mo&s;t Advantage to her Complection?&mdash; Come, I fan&s;y, I &s;hall, at lea&s;t, divide Perfections with your <HI>Pamela.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="242">Your Lady&s;hip's delicate light Brown is extremely beautiful, and infinitely better becomes your Com|plection and Features, than would that lovely &s;hine|ing Auburn, which &s;uits be&s;t with my Girl's.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I always called you my Girl, to her, as I do frequently to your&s;elf and others.</P>
<P>So &s;he excels me there, I find!</P>
<P>I don't &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>Well, but as to the FOREHEAD. Mr. <HI>B.?</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, my Girl has &s;ome Advantage, I pre&s;ume to think, in her Forehead: She has a no|ble Openne&s;s and Freedom there, that be&s;peaks her Mind, and every body's Favour, the Moment &s;he appears: Not but that your Lady&s;hip's, next to hers, is the fine&s;t I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>So!&mdash;<HI>Next</HI> to hers! rubbing her Forehead&mdash;Well, BROWS, Mr. <HI>B.</HI>?</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip's fine Arch-Brow is a Beauty in your fair Face, that a Pencil cannot imitate; but then your fairer Hair &s;hews it not to that Advan|tage, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that her darker Hair gives her; for, as to COMPLECTION, your are both &s;o charmingly fair, that I cannot, for my Life, give a Preference to either.</P>
<P>Well, well, fooli&s;h Man, &s;aid &s;he, peevi&s;hly, thou art &s;trangely taken with thy Girl!&mdash;I wi&s;h thou would&s;t go about thy Bu&s;ine&s;s!&mdash;What &s;ignifies a little bad Weather to Men?&mdash;But if her Comple|ction is as good as mine, it mu&s;t look better, be|cau&s;e of her dark Hair.&mdash;I &s;hall come poorly off, I find!&mdash;Let's have the EYES, however.</P>
<P>For black Eyes in my Girl, and blue in your La|dy&s;hip, they are both the lovelie&s;t I ever beheld.&mdash; And, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I was wicked enough to &s;ay, That it would be the &s;weete&s;t Travelling in the World,
<PB N="242" REF="243">
to have you both placed at Fifty Miles Di&s;tance from each other, and to pa&s;s the Prime of one's Life from Black to Blue, and from Blue to Black; and it would be impo&s;&s;ible to know which to prefer, but the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Ah! naughty Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid I, were you not wor&s;e than the Counte&s;s a great deal?</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s is not bad, my Dear. I was all in Fault.</P>
<P>But what, Sir, did &s;he &s;ay to you?</P>
<P>Say! why, the &s;aucy Lady did what very few Ladies have ever done: She made the Powder fly out of my Wig, by a &s;mart Cuff, with her nimble Fingers.</P>
<P>And how, Sir, did you take that?</P>
<P>How, my Dear!&mdash;Why I ki&s;s'd her in Revenge.</P>
<P>Fine Doings between two <HI>Platonicks!</HI> thought I.</P>
<P>But I will own to you, Madam, that my Vanity in this Compari&s;on, was too much &s;oothed, not to wi&s;h to hear how it was carried on.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, did you proceed further in your Com|pari&s;on?</P>
<P>I knew, my Dear, you would not let me fini&s;h at half your Picture.&mdash;O <HI>Pamela</HI>&mdash;Who &s;ays, you are ab&s;olutely perfect? Who &s;ays, there is no <HI>Sex</HI> in your <HI>Mind</HI>? and tapp'd my Neck.</P>
<P>All is owing, Sir, to the Pride I take in your Opinion. I care not how indifferent I appear in the Eyes of all the World be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The CHEEK came next, proceeded Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I allow'd her Lady&s;hip to have a livelier Carmine in hers; and that it was &s;omewhat rounder, her Lady|&s;hip being a little plumper than my Girl; but that <HI>your</HI> Face, my Dear, being rather &s;maller featur'd of the two, there was an inimitably finer Turn in your Cheek, than I had ever &s;een in my Life.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="244">Her Lady&s;hip &s;troked her Cheek-bones, which, however, Madam, I think, are far from being high, (tho', to be &s;ure, &s;he is a little larger featur'd; in excellent Proportion, for all that, as &s;he is of a taller and a larger Make than me) and &s;aid, Very well, Sir; you are determined to mortify me. But, added her Lady&s;hip, (which &s;hewed, Madam, &s;he little depended upon <HI>Platonici&s;m</HI> in him) if you have a <HI>View</HI> in this, you will be greatly mi&s;taken, I'll a&s;&s;ure you: For, let me tell you, Sir, the Lady who can think meanly of her&s;elf, is any Man's Pur|chace.</P>
<P>The NOSE I left in doubt, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> but al|low'd, that each were exqui&s;itely beautiful on its own proper Face.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip was &s;ure of a Preference in her MOUTH. I allow'd, that her LIPS were &s;omewhat plumper&mdash;and, &s;aluting her by Surprize, (for which I had much ado to pre&s;erve my Wig from another Di&s;order&mdash;) a little &s;ofter, of Con&s;equence; but not quite &s;o red&mdash;for, &s;aid I, I never &s;aw a Lip of &s;o rich and balmy a Red in my Life, as my Girl's.</P>
<P>But <HI>your</HI> SMILES, Madam, are more bewitch|ingly free and attractive; for my Girl is a little too grave.</P>
<P>And, my Lady, charming as your TEETH are, I think hers not a whit inferior in Whitene&s;s and Regularity.</P>
<P>Her CHIN, my Lady, is a &s;weet Addition to her Face, by that ea&s;y &s;oft half Round, that looks as if Nature had begun at Top, and gave that as her fini&s;hing Stroke to the re&s;t: While, my dear Lady, yours is a little, little too &s;trong featur'd; but &s;uch as &s;o infinitely becomes your Face, that my Girl's Chin would not have half the Beauty upon your Face.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="245">Her EARS, my Lady, are ju&s;t &s;uch as your own. &mdash;Mu&s;t they not be beautiful then? Her NECK, tho' it mu&s;t not pre&s;ume&mdash;let me &s;ee, Madam, approaching her&mdash;(Keep your Di&s;tance, Sir. I was forced to do &s;o)&mdash;tho' it mu&s;t not pretend to excel yours for Whitene&s;s, yet, except yours, did I never &s;ee any Neck &s;o beautiful. But your Lady&s;hip, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, being a little plumper in Per&s;on, has the Advantage <HI>here.</HI></P>
<P>I had a &s;mart Rap on my Knuckles with her Fan. And &s;he would hear no more. But was re&s;olv'd &s;he would &s;ee you, &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>And, my Dear, I am the more particular in re|peating this comparative De&s;cription of the two charming'&s;t Per&s;ons in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e you will &s;ee the Rea&s;on, (and that it was not to in&s;ult you, as you rightly judg'd in your Letter to my Si&s;ter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>133.</HI> l. <HI>17.</HI></NOTE>, but to your Advantage) that I gave way to the Im|portunity of the Countes to &s;ee you; for I little thought you were &s;o well acquainted with our Inti|macy; much le&s;s, that we had been made more intimate, to you, than ever, in Truth, we were, or, perhaps, might have been: And when I a&s;ked you, Why you were not richer dre&s;s'd, and had not your Jewels, you may believe, (as I had no Rea&s;on to doubt, that the Counte&s;s would come in all her Ornaments) I was not willing my Girl &s;hould give way to the noble Emulatre&s;s in any thing; being concern'd for your own Honour, as well as mine, in the Superiority of Beauty I had &s;o ju&s;tly given you.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, to be &s;ure, this was kind, very kind; and little was I di&s;po&s;ed (knowing what I knew) to pa&s;s &s;o favourable a Con&s;truction on your Genero|&s;ity to me.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="246">My Que&s;tion to her Lady&s;hip, continued Mr. <HI>B.</HI> at going away, Whether you was not the charming'&s;t Girl in the World, which, &s;eeing you together at one View, rich as &s;he was dre&s;t, and plain as you, gave me the double Plea&s;ure (a Plea&s;ure &s;he &s;aid afterwards I exulted in) of deciding in your Fa|vour; my Readine&s;s to explain to you what we both &s;aid, and her not ungenerous An&s;wer, I thought would have intitled me to a better Return than a Flood of Tears; which confirm'd me, that your pa&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s was a Jealou&s;y, I was not willing to allow in you; tho' I &s;hould have been more indulgent to it, had I known the Grounds you thought you had for it: And this was the Rea|&s;on of my leaving you &s;o abruptly as I did.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOW I will proceed with my former Subject; and with the greater Plea&s;ure, as what follows makes &s;till more in favour of the Counte&s;s's Cha|racter, than what went before, altho' that &s;et it in a better Light, than it had once appeared to me in. I began, as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="247">Will you be plea&s;ed, Sir, to favour me with the Continuation of our la&s;t Subject? I will, my Dear. You left off, Sir, with acquitting me (as knowing what I knew) for breaking out into that Flood of Tears, which occa&s;ioned your abrupt Departure. But, dear Sir, will you be plea&s;ed to &s;atisfy me about that affecting Information, of your Intention and my Lady's, to live at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> together?</P>
<P>'Tis ab&s;olutely Malice and Fal&s;hood. Our Inti|macy had not proceeded &s;o far; and, thoughtle&s;s as my Si&s;ter's Letters &s;uppo&s;e the Lady, &s;he would have &s;purn'd at &s;uch a Propo&s;ition, I dare &s;ay.</P>
<P>Well, but then, Sir, as to the Expre&s;&s;ion to her Uncle, that &s;he had rather have been a certain Gen|tleman's &s;econd Wife?</P>
<P>I believe, &s;he might &s;ay &s;omething like it in Pa&s;|&s;ion to him: He had been teizing her (from the time that I held an Argument in favour of that fooli&s;h To|pick <HI>Polygamy,</HI> in his Company, and his Niece's, and in that of her Si&s;ter and the Vi&s;count) with Cautions again&s;t conver&s;ing with a Man, who, having, as he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay behind my Back, marry'd beneath him, wanted to ingage the Affe|ctions of a Lady of Birth, in order to recover, by doubling the Fault upon her, the Reputation he had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>She de&s;pis'd his In&s;inuation enough to an&s;wer him, That &s;he thought my Arguments in Behalf of <HI>Polygamy</HI> were convincing. This &s;et him a raving, and he threw &s;ome coar&s;e Reflections upon her, which could not be repeated, if one may gue&s;s at them, by her being incapable to tell me what they were; and then, to vex him more, and to revenge her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid &s;omething like what was reported: And this was Handle enough for her Uncle, who took care to propagate it with an Indi&s;cretion
<PB N="247" REF="248">
peculiar to him&s;elf; for I heard of it in three differ|ent Companies, before I knew any thing of it from her&s;elf; and when I did, it was &s;o repeated, as you, my Dear, would hardly have cen&s;ur'd her for it, the Provocation con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>Well, but then, dear Sir, there is nothing at all ami&s;s, at this Rate, in the Corre&s;pondence between my Lady and you?</P>
<P>Not on her Side, I dare &s;ay, if her Lady&s;hip can be excu&s;ed to Punctilio, and for having a greater E&s;teem for a married Man, than he can de&s;erve, or than may be &s;trictly defended to a Per&s;on of your Purity and Nicene&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, this is very noble in you. I love to hear the Gentlemen generous in Points where the Honour of our Sex is concern'd.</P>
<P>But, pray, Sir, what then was there on <HI>your</HI> Side, in that Matter, that made you give me &s;o patient and &s;o kind a Hearing?</P>
<P>Now, my Dear, you come to the Point: At fir&s;t it was, as I have &s;aid before, nothing in me but Vanity, Pride, and Love of Intrigue, to try my Strength, where I had met with &s;ome Encou|ragement, as I thought, at the Ma&s;querade; where the Lady went further too than &s;he would have done, had &s;he not thought I was a &s;ingle Man. For by what I have told you, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you will ob&s;erve, that &s;he endeavour'd to &s;atisfy her&s;elf on that Head, as &s;oon as &s;he well could. Mrs. <HI>Nel|thorpe</HI> acquainted me afterwards, when we were better known to one another, That her Lady was &s;o partial in my Favour, (Who can always govern their Fancies, my Dear?) as to think, &s;o early as at the Ma&s;querade, that if every thing an&s;wer'd Ap|pearances, and that I were a &s;ingle Man, &s;he, who has a noble and independent Fortune, might po&s;&s;i|bly
<PB N="248" REF="249">
be induc'd to make me happy in her Choice.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then, that I was unmarry'd, &s;he left a Signal for me in her Handkerchief. I vi&s;ited her; had the Honour, after the cu&s;tomary fir&s;t Shy|ne&s;s, of being well receiv'd by her; and continued my Vi&s;its, till, perhaps, &s;he would have been glad I had not been marry'd: But, when &s;he found I was, &s;he avoided me, as I have told you; till the Accident I mention'd, threw us again upon one another, which renew'd our Intimacy upon Terms perhaps too incon&s;iderate on one Side, and too de|&s;igning on the other.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, what can I &s;ay? Only that you (without Cau&s;e, as I thought) gave me great Di&s;|gu&s;ts by your unwonted Reception of me: Ever in Tears and Grief; the Counte&s;s ever chearful and lively: And apprehending, that your Temper was intirely changing; I believ'd I had no bad Excu&s;e to make my&s;elf ea&s;y and chearful abroad, &s;ince my Home became more irk&s;ome to me, than ever I believ'd it could be. Then, as we naturally love tho&s;e, who love us, I had Vanity, and &s;ome Rea|&s;on for my Vanity (indeed all vain Men believe they have)&mdash;to think the Counte&s;s had more than an In|difference for me. She was &s;o exa&s;perated by the wrong Methods taken with an independent Lady of her generous Spirit, to break off the Acquaint|ance with me, that in Revenge &s;he deny'd me le&s;s than ever Opportunities of her Company. The Plea&s;ure we took in each other's Conver&s;ation, was reciprocal. The World's Reports had united us in one common Cau&s;e; and you, as I &s;aid, had made Home le&s;s delightful to me, than it us'd to be: What might not then have been apprehended from
<PB N="249" REF="250">
&s;o many Circum&s;tances concurring with the Lady's Beauty and my Frailty?</P>
<P>I waited on her to Tunbridge. She took an Hou&s;e there. Where Peoples Tongues will take &s;o much Liberty, when they have no Foundation for it at all, and where the utmo&s;t Circum&s;pection is us'd, what will they not &s;ay, where &s;o little of the latter is aim'd at? No wonder then, that Terms were &s;aid to be agreed upon between us: From her Uncle's Story, of <HI>Polygamy</HI> propos'd by me, and agreed to by her, no wonder that all your <HI>Thoma&s;ine-Fuller</HI>'s Information was &s;urmi&s;ed.</P>
<P>And thus &s;tood the Matter, when I was deter|min'd to give your Cau&s;e for Unea&s;ine&s;s a fair Hear|ing, and to take my Mea&s;ures according to what &s;hould re&s;ult from that Hearing.</P>
<P>From this Account, dear Sir, &s;aid I, it will not be &s;o difficult, as I was afraid it would be, to end this Affair even to her <HI>Lady&s;hip</HI>'s Satisfaction!</P>
<P>I hope not, my Dear.</P>
<P>But, if, now, Sir, the Counte&s;s &s;hould &s;till be de&s;irous not to break with you; from &s;o charming a Lady, who knows what may happen!</P>
<P>Very true, <HI>Pamela:</HI> But, to make you &s;till ea&s;ier, I will tell you, That her Lady&s;hip has a fir&s;t Cou&s;in marry'd to a Per&s;on with a publick Cha|racter to &s;everal of the <HI>Italian</HI> Courts; and had it not been for my Per&s;ua&s;ions, &s;he would have ac|cepted of their earne&s;t Invitations, and pa&s;s'd a Year or two in <HI>Italy</HI> where &s;he once re&s;ided for three Years together, which makes her &s;o perfect a Mi|&s;tre&s;s of <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P>Now I will let her know, additional to what I have written to her, the Unea&s;ine&s;s I have given you, and, &s;o far as it is proper, what is come to your Ears, and your generous Account of her, and
<PB N="250" REF="251">
the Charms of her Per&s;on, of which &s;he will not be a little proud; for &s;he has really noble and gene|rous Sentiments, and thinks well (tho', her Si&s;ter, in Plea&s;antry, will have it, a little enviou&s;ly) of you: And when I &s;hall endeavour to per&s;uade her to go, for the &s;ake of her own Character, to a Place and Country of which &s;he was always fond, I am apt to think &s;he will come into it; for &s;he has a greater Opinion of my Judgment, than it de&s;erves: And I know a young Lord, that may be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to follow her thither, and bring her back his Lady, if he can obtain her Con&s;ent: And what &s;ay you, <HI>Pamela,</HI> to this?</P>
<P>O, Sir! I believe I &s;hall begin to love the Lady dearly, and that is what I never thought I &s;hould. I hope this will be brought about.</P>
<P>But I &s;ee, give me Leave to &s;ay, Sir, how dan|gerou&s;ly you might have gone on, both you and my Lady, under the Notion of this <HI>Platonick</HI> Love, till two precious Souls might have been lo&s;t: And this &s;hews one, as well in Spirituals as Temporals, from what &s;light Beginnings the greate&s;t Mi&s;chiefs &s;ometimes &s;pring; and how ea&s;y at fir&s;t a Breach may be &s;topp'd, that, when neglected, the Waves of Pa&s;&s;ion will improve, and bear down all before them.</P>
<P>Your Ob&s;ervation, my Dear, is ju&s;t, reply'd he; and tho' I am confident the Lady was more in Ear|ne|&s;t than my&s;elf in the Notion of <HI>Platonick</HI> Love, yet am I convinc'd, and always was, That <HI>Plato|nick</HI> Love is <HI>Platonick</HI> Non&s;en&s;e: 'Tis the Fly buzzing about the Blaze, till its Wings are &s;corch'd: Or, to &s;peak &s;till &s;tronger, It is a Bait of the Devil to catch the Unexperienc'd and Thoughtle&s;s: Nor ought &s;uch Notions to be pretended to, till the Par|ties are Five or Ten Years on the other Side of their

<P>Here, Madam, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> fini&s;hed his Narrative. He is now &s;et out for <HI>Tunbridge</HI> with all my Papers. I have no Doubt in his Honour, and kind A&s;&s;urances, and hope my next will be a joyful Let|ter; and that I &s;hall inform you in it, that the Affair which went &s;o near my Heart, is ab&s;olutely con|cluded to my Satisfaction, to Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s, and to the <HI>Counte&s;s</HI>; for if it be &s;o to all three, my Happi|ne&s;s will be founded on a permanent Ba&s;is, I hope.

<P>A New Misfortune, my dear Lady!&mdash;But this is of God Almighty's &s;ending; &s;o mu&s;t bear it patiently. My dear Baby is taken with the Small-pox! To how many Troubles are the happie&s;t of us &s;ubjected, in this Life! One need not multiply them by one's own wilful Mi&s;managements!&mdash;I am able to mind nothing el&s;e!</P>
<P>I had &s;o much Joy (as I told your Lady&s;hip in the Beginning of my la&s;t Letter but one) to &s;ee, on our Arrival at the Farm-hou&s;e, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="253">
my beloved Baby, and my good Father and Mother, all upon one happy Spot together, that I fear I was too proud.&mdash;Yet I was truly thankful&mdash;I am &s;ure I was!&mdash;But I had, notwith&s;tanding, too much Pride and too much Plea&s;ure, on this happy Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I told your Lady&s;hip, in my la&s;t, that your dear Brother &s;et out on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Morning for <HI>Tunbridge</HI> with my Papers: And I was longing to know the Re&s;ult, hoping that every thing would be concluded to the Satisfaction of all Three: For, thought I, if this be &s;o, my Happine&s;s mu&s;t be permanent. But, alas! alas! There is nothing permanent in this Life. I feel it by Experience now!&mdash;I knew it before by Theory! But that was not &s;o near and &s;o intere&s;t|ing by half!</P>
<P>For in the Mid&s;t of all my Plea&s;ures and Hopes; in the Mid&s;t of my dear Parents Joy and Congratu|lations on our Arrival, and on what had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o happily &s;ince we were la&s;t here together, (in the Birth of the dear Child, and my Safety, for which they had been &s;o apprehen&s;ive) the dear Baby was taken ill. It was on that very <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Afternoon, his Papa &s;et out for <HI>Tunbridge</HI>: But we knew not it would be the Small-pox till <HI>Thur&s;day!</HI> Oh! Ma|dam! how are all the Plea&s;ures I had form'd to my|&s;elf, &s;icken'd now upon me! for my <HI>Billy</HI> is very bad.</P>
<P>They talk of a kind Sort; but, alas! they talk at random: for they come not out at all! How then can they &s;ay they are kind?&mdash;I fear the Nur&s;e's Con&s;titution is too hale and too rich for the dear Baby!&mdash;Had <HI>I</HI> been permitted&mdash;But, hu&s;h! all my repining <HI>Ifs!</HI>&mdash;Except one <HI>If</HI>; and that,&mdash;<HI>If</HI> it be got happily over, it will be be&s;t he had it &s;o young, and while at the Brea&s;t!</P>

<P>They want to &s;end for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to keep me from him!&mdash;But I forbid it!&mdash;For what &s;ignifies Life or any thing, if I cannot &s;ee my Baby, while he is &s;o dangerou&s;ly ill?</P>
<P>My Father and Mother are, for the fir&s;t time, quite cruel to me; they have forbid me, and I ne|ver was &s;o de&s;irous of di&s;obeying them before, to at|tend the Darling of my Heart: And why?&mdash;For fear of this poor Face!&mdash;For fear I &s;hould get it my|&s;elf!&mdash;But I am living low, very low, and have taken proper Precautions by Bleeding, and the like, to le&s;&s;en the Di&s;temper's Fury, if I &s;hould have it: And the re&s;t I leave to Providence. And if Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Value is confin'd &s;o much to this poor tran&s;itory Sightline&s;s, he mu&s;t not break with his Counte&s;s, I think; and if I am ever &s;o deform'd in Per&s;on, my poor Intellects, I hope, will not be impair'd, and I &s;hall, if GOD &s;pare my <HI>Billy,</HI> be u&s;eful in his fir&s;t Education, and be helpful to dear Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI>&mdash; or to any Babies&mdash;with all my Heart&mdash;he may make me an humble Nur&s;e to!&mdash;How peevi&s;h, &s;infully &s;o, I doubt, does this Accident, and their affection|ate Contradiction, make one!</P>

I am the more rejoic'd, as her &s;weet Face is not likely to &s;uffer by the Malady; for, be the Beauties of the Mind what they will, tho&s;e of Per&s;on are no &s;mall Recommendation, with &s;ome Folks, I am &s;ure; and I began to be afraid, that when it was hardly po&s;&s;ible for <HI>both conjoined</HI> to keep a roving Mind con&s;tant, that <HI>one only</HI> would not be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>This News gives me the more Plea&s;ure, becau&s;e I am well inform'd, that a certain gay Lady was plea&s;ed to give her&s;elf Airs upon hearing of my Si&s;ter's Illne&s;s; as, That &s;he could not be &s;orry for it; for now &s;he &s;hould look upon her&s;elf as the prettie&s;t Woman in <HI>England.</HI> She meant only, I &s;uppo&s;e, as to <HI>outward</HI> Prettine&s;s, Brother!</P>

<P>But however that be, the Rod &s;eems to have been held up, as a Warning&mdash;and that the Blow, in the irreparable Deprivation, is not given, is a Mercy, that I hope will be de&s;erved; tho' you never can tho&s;e very &s;ignal ones you receive at the Divine Hands, beyond any Gentleman I know. For even (if I &s;hall not be deemed cen&s;orious again) your very Vices have been turned to your Felicity, as if GOD would try the Noblene&s;s of the Heart he has given you, by overcoming you (in An&s;wer to my Si&s;ter's con&s;tant Prayers, as well as mine) by Mercies rather than by Judgments.</P>
<P>I might give In&s;tances of the Truth of this 0b|&s;ervation, in almo&s;t all the Actions and Attempts of your pa&s;t Life: And take care, (if you <HI>are</HI> di&s;|plea&s;ed, I <HI>will</HI> &s;peak it) take care, thou bold Wretch, that if this Method be ingratefully &s;lighted, the uplifted Arm fall not down with double Weight on thy devoted Head!</P>

<P>This leads me to mention to your Lady&s;hip, what my Illne&s;s would not permit me to do before, that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> met with &s;uch a Reception and Audience from the Counte&s;s, when he attended her, in all he had to offer and propo&s;e to her, and in her patient Hearing of what he thought fit to read her from your Lady&s;hip's Letters and mine, that he &s;aid, Don't be jealous, my dear <HI>Pamela</HI>; but I mu&s;t admire her, as long as I live.</P>
<P>He gave me the Particulars, &s;o much to her Lady|&s;hip's Honour, that I told him, he &s;hould not only be welcome to admire her Lady&s;hip, but that I would admire her too.</P>
<P>They parted very good Friends, and with great Profe&s;&s;ions of E&s;teem for each other&mdash;And as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> had undertaken to in&s;pect into &s;ome exceptionable Accounts and Managements of her Lady&s;hip's Bai|liff, one of her Servants brought a Letter for him on <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t, wholly written on that Subject. But her Lady&s;hip was &s;o kindly con&s;iderate, as to &s;end it un&s;ealed, in a Cover directed to me. When I open'd it, I was frighted, to &s;ee it begin, to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and I ha&s;tened to find him, in the Walk up to the new-rais'd Mount.&mdash;Dear Sir&mdash;Here's &s;ome Mi&s;take&mdash;You &s;ee the Direction is to Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>
<PB N="264" REF="265">
&mdash;'Tis very plain&mdash;But upon my Word, I have not read it.</P>
<P>Don't be unea&s;y, my Love!&mdash;I know what the Subject mu&s;t be; but I dare &s;wear there is nothing, nor will there ever be, but what you or any body may &s;ee.</P>

<P>I told him, I was intirely ea&s;y and unapprehen|&s;ive; and, after all his Goodne&s;s to me, &s;hould be &s;o, if he &s;aw the Counte&s;s every Day.

<P>He went in with me, and wrote an An&s;wer, which he &s;ent by the Me&s;&s;enger; but would make me, whether I would or not, read it, and &s;eal it up with his Seal. But all this needed not to me

<P>I really am better pleas'd with this Corre&s;pondence than I &s;hould have been, had it not been carry'd on; becau&s;e the Servants, on both Sides, will &s;ee, by my Deportment on the Occa&s;ion, (and I will officiou&s;ly, with a &s;miling Countenance, throw my&s;elf in their Ob&s;ervation) that it is quite innocent; and this may help to &s;ilence the Mouths of tho&s;e who have &s;o freely cen&s;ur'd their Conduct.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, I think I have received no &s;mall Good my&s;elf by that Affair, which once lay &s;o heavy upon me: For I don't believe I &s;hall ever be jealous again; indeed, I don't think I &s;hall.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Mi&s;s</HI> DARNFORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE you are happy and well. You kindly &s;ay you can't be &s;o, till you hear of my perfect Recovery. And this, ble&s;&s;ed be God! you have heard already from Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>As to your Intimation of the fair Nun, 'tis all happily over. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, for that too: And I have a better and more indearing Husband than ever. Did you think that could be?</P>
<P>My <HI>Billy</HI> too improves every Day: And my dear Father and Mother &s;eem to have their Youth renew'd like the Eagle's. How many Ble&s;&s;ings have I to be thankful for!</P>
<P>We are about to turn Travellers, to the Northern Counties, I think, quite to the Borders; and after|wards to the We&s;tern, to <HI>Bath,</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and I know not whither my&s;elf. But among the re&s;t, to
<PB N="267" REF="268">
<HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> that you may be &s;ure of. Then how happy &s;hall I be in my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford!</HI></P>
<P>I long to hear whether poor Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> is bet|ter or wor&s;e for the Advice of the Doctor, whom I order'd to attend her from <HI>Stamford</HI>; and in what Frame her Mind is.</P>
<P>Do, my dear Mi&s;s, vouch&s;afe her a Vi&s;it, in my Name; tell her, if &s;he be low-&s;pirited, what God has done for me, as to my Recovery, and comfort her all you can; and bid her &s;pare neither Expence nor Attendance, nor any thing her Heart can wi&s;h for, nor the Company of any Relations or Friends &s;he may de&s;ire to be with her.</P>
<P>If &s;he is in her <HI>la&s;t Stage,</HI> poor Soul! how noble will it be in you to give her Comfort and Con&s;o|lation in her dying Hours!</P>
<P>Altho' we can merit nothing at the Hand of God, yet I have a Notion, that we cannot de&s;erve more of one another, and, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, for that Rea&s;on, of HIM, than in our Charities on &s;o trying an Exi|gence! When the poor Soul &s;tands &s;hivering, as it were, on the Edge of Life, and has nothing &s;trong, but its Fears and Doubts!&mdash;Then a little Balm pour'd into the Wounds of the Mind, a little comforting Advice to rely on God's Mercies, from a good Per&s;on; how con&s;olatory mu&s;t it be! And how, like Morning Mi&s;ts before the Sun, mu&s;t all Diffidences and gloomy Doubts be cha&s;ed away by it!</P>
<P>But, my dear Mi&s;s, the great Occa&s;ion of my writing to you ju&s;t now, is, by Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s De&s;ire, on a quite different Subject. She knows how we love one another. And &s;he has &s;ent me the following Lines by her Kin&s;man, who came to <HI>Kent,</HI> purpo&s;ely to inquire how my Face far'd in the Small|pox; and accompany'd us from <HI>Kent</HI> hither, (<HI>i. e.</HI> to <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI>) and &s;ets out To-morrow for Lord <HI>Davers</HI>'s.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Now, my dear Mi&s;s, as my Lady has &s;o well &s;tated the Ca&s;e, I beg you to inable me to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn an
<PB N="269" REF="270">
An&s;wer. I will not &s;ay one Word <HI>pro</HI> or <HI>con.</HI> till I know your Mind &mdash; Only, that I think he is good-humour'd, and might be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to any thing a Lady &s;hould think rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>And now, I mu&s;t tell you another Piece of News in the matrimonial way. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> has been here to congratulate us, on our multiply'd Ble&s;&s;ings; and he has acquainted Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that an Overture has been made him by his new Patron, (for I &s;uppo&s;e you know, that all is adju&s;ted accord|ing to the Scheme I formerly acquainted you with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. III. <HI>p.</HI> 297, 299.</NOTE>, between Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> and him, and both are &s;ettled in their re&s;pective Livings; only, that I ought to have to have told you, that Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> on mature Con&s;ideration, declin'd the &s;tipulated 80 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> from Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> as he thought it would have a Simo|niacal Appearance) of a Kin&s;woman of his Lord|&s;hip's, a Lady of Virtue and Merit, and a Fortune of 3000 <HI>l.</HI> to make him Amends, as the Earl tells him, for quitting a better Living to oblige him; and that he is in great Hope of obtaining the Lady's Con|&s;ent, which is all that is wanting. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is very much plea&s;ed with &s;o good a Pro&s;pect in Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s Favour, and has been in the Lady's Com|pany formerly at a Ball, at <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>; and he &s;ays, &s;he is a prudent and de&s;erving Lady; and offers to make a Journey on Purpo&s;e to forward it, if he can be of Service.</P>
<P>But now my Hand's in, let me tell you of a third matrimonial Propo&s;ition, which gives me more Puzzle and Di&s;like a great deal. And that is, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> has, with great Reluctance, and after abundance of ba&s;hful Apologies, reque&s;ted of me, to know, If I have any Objection to his making his Addre&s;&s;es to <HI>Polly Barlow?</HI> Which, however, he told me, he had
<PB N="270" REF="271">
not mention'd to her, nor to any body living, becau&s;e he would fir&s;t know whether I &s;hould take it ami&s;s, as her Service was &s;o immediately about my Per&s;on.</P>
<P>This unexpected Motion perplex'd me a good deal. The Gentleman is a worthy and a pious Man. He has now a very good Living; but is but ju&s;t enter'd upon it; and I think, according to his accu|&s;tom'd Prudence in other re&s;pects, had better have turn'd him&s;elf about fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But that is not the Point with me neither. I have a great Regard to the Function. I think it is as ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to pre&s;erve the Re&s;pect due to the Clergy, that their Wives &s;hould be nearly, if not quite, as unblemi&s;h'd, and as circum&s;pect, as them&s;elves; and this, for the Gentleman's own &s;ake, as well as in the Eye of the World; for how &s;hall he pur&s;ue his Studies with Comfort to him&s;elf, if he be made unea&s;y at home? or how &s;hall he expect his Female Pari&s;hio|ners will regard his <HI>publick</HI> Preaching, when he cannot influence the <HI>private</HI> Practice of his Wife?</P>
<P>I can't &s;ay, excepting in the In&s;tance of Mr. <HI>H.</HI> but <HI>Polly</HI> is a good &s;ort of Body enough; &s;o far as I know: But that is &s;uch a Blot in the poor Girl's E&s;cutcheon, a Thing not <HI>accidental,</HI> not <HI>&s;urpris'd</HI> into, not owing to <HI>Inattention,</HI> but to cool <HI>Preme|ditation,</HI> after &s;he had &s;lept over and over upon it; that, I think, I could wi&s;h Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> a Wife more unexceptionable.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> knows not this; &mdash; but <HI>that</HI> is one of my Difficulties. If I tell him, I &s;hall hurt the poor Maiden irreparably, and deprive her of a Gentleman for a Husband, to whom &s;he may po&s;&s;i|bly make a good Wife &mdash; For &s;he is not very meanly de&s;cended &mdash; much better than my&s;elf, as the World would account it, were they to judge from my my Father's low E&s;tate, when I was exalted.&mdash;I never, dear Mi&s;s, &s;hall be a&s;ham'd of the&s;e Retro&s;pections!</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="272">She is genteel, has a very innocent Look, a good Face, is neat in her Per&s;on, and not addicted to any Exce&s;s, that I know of. But, <HI>&s;till,</HI> my dear Mi&s;s, that one <HI>premeditated</HI> Fault, is &s;o &s;ad a one, that tho' &s;he might make a good Wife, for any mid|dling Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, &mdash; yet &s;he wants, methinks, that Purity, that Conduct, which I would always have in the Wife of a good Clergyman.</P>
<P>Then, be&s;ides, &s;he has not apply'd her Thoughts to that &s;ort of Oeconomy, which is proper for the Wife of a Country Clergyman to know &s;omething of: And &s;he has a Turn to Dre&s;s and Appearance, that I can &s;ee, if indulg'd, &s;he would not be one that would help to remove the Scandal which &s;ome &s;evere Remarkers are apt to throw upon the Wives of <HI>Par&s;ons,</HI> as they call them.</P>
<P>The Maiden, I believe, likes Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> not a little. She is very courteous to every body, but mo&s;t to him of any body, and never has mi&s;s'd being pre&s;ent at our <HI>Sunday</HI> Duties; and five or &s;ix times, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> tells me, &s;he has found her de&s;irous to have Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> expound this Text, and that Diffi|culty; and the good Man is taken with her Piety: Which, and her Reformation, I hope, is &s;incere: But, Oh! Mi&s;s! &s;he is very &s;ly, very &s;ubtle, as I have found in &s;everal In&s;tances, as fooli&s;h as &s;he was in the Affair I hint at.</P>
<P>So, &s;ometimes, I &s;ay to my&s;elf, The Girl may love Mr. <HI>Adams:</HI> Ay, but then I an&s;wer, So &s;he did Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and on his own very bad Terms too. &mdash; In &s;hort &mdash; but I won't be too cen&s;orious neither.</P>
<P>So I'll &s;ay no more, than that I was perplexed; and yet &s;hould be very glad to have <HI>Polly</HI> well marry'd; for, &s;ince <HI>that</HI> Time, I have always had &s;ome Diffidences about her &mdash; Becau&s;e, you know, Mi&s;s &mdash; her Fault was &s;o enormous, and &s;o premedi|tated!
<PB N="272" REF="273">
I wanted you to advi&s;e with &mdash; But this was the Method I took.</P>
<P>I appointed Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> to drink a Di&s;h of Tea with me in the Afternoon. <HI>Polly</HI> attended, as &s;he generally does; for I can't &s;ay I love Men Attendants in the&s;e womanly Offices &mdash; A Tea-kettle in a Man's Hand, that would, if there was no better Imployment for him, be fitter to hold a Plough, or handle a Flail, or a Scythe, has &s;uch a Look with it! &mdash;This is like my low Breeding, &s;ome would &s;ay, perhaps &mdash; But I cannot call Things polite, that I think un&s;eemly; and, moreover, let me tell you, Lady <HI>Davers</HI> keeps me in Countenance in this my Notion; and who doubts her Politene&s;s?</P>
<P>Well, but <HI>Polly</HI> attended, as I &s;aid; and there were &s;trange Simperings, and Bowing, and Court'&s;ying, between them; the hone&s;t Gentleman &s;eeming not to know how to let his Mi&s;tre&s;s wait upon him; while &s;he behav'd with as much Re&s;pect and Offici|ou&s;ne&s;s, as if &s;he could not do too much for him.</P>
<P>Very well, thought I; I have &s;uch an Opinion of your Veracity, Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> that I dare &s;ay you have not, becau&s;e you told me you have not, mention'd the Matter to <HI>Polly:</HI> But, between her Officiou&s;ne&s;s, and your mutual Simperings, and Complai&s;ance, I &s;ee you have found out a Language between you, that is full as &s;ignificant as plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Words. <HI>Polly,</HI> thought I, &s;ees no Difficulty in <HI>this</HI> Text; nor need you, Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> have much Trouble to make her under&s;tand, when you come to expound on <HI>this</HI> Subject.</P>
<P>I was forced, in &s;hort, to put on a &s;tatelier and more re&s;erv'd Appearance than u&s;ual, to make them avoid Acts of Complai&s;ance for one another, that might not be proper to be &s;hewn before me, from one who &s;at as my Companion, to my Servant.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274">When &s;he withdrew, the mode&s;t Gentleman hem'd, and look'd on one Side, and turn'd to the right and left, as if his Seat was unea&s;y to him, and I &s;aw knew not how to &s;peak; &s;o I began in mere Com|pa&s;&s;ion to him, and &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> I have been thinking of what you mention'd to me, as to <HI>Polly Barlow.</HI></P>
<P>Hem! Hem! &s;aid he; and pull'd out his Hand|kerchief, and wip'd his Mouth &mdash; Very well, Madam; &mdash; I hope, no Offence, Madam!</P>
<P>No, Sir, none at all.

<P>Madam &mdash; Madam, &s;aid the ba&s;hful Gentleman he&s;itatingly &mdash; I do &mdash; I mu&s;t needs &s;ay &mdash; I can't but own &mdash; that &mdash; Mrs. <HI>Mary</HI> &mdash; is a Per&s;on &mdash; whom I think very agreeable; and no le&s;s mode&s;t and vir|tuous.</P>
<P>You know, Sir, your own Circum&s;tances. To be &s;ure you have a very pretty Hou&s;e, and a good Living to carry a Wife to.

It has been an Expence to you, rather, that you will not pre&s;ently get up: Do you propo&s;e an early Mar|riage, Sir? Or were it not better, that you &s;u&s;pended your Intentions of that &s;ort for a Year or two more?</P>
<P>Madam, if your Lady&s;hip chu&s;e not to part with&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> interrupted I, I &s;ay not any thing for my own &s;ake in this Point; that is out of the Que&s;tion with me. I can very willingly part with <HI>Polly,</HI> were it To-morrow, for her Good and yours.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="275">Madam, &s;aid he, I humbly beg Pardon; but&mdash; but &mdash; Delays&mdash; may breed Dangers.</P>
<P>Oh! very well! thought I; I'll be further, if the artful Girl has not let him know, by &s;ome Means or other, that &s;he has &s;ome other humble Servant.</P>
<P>And &s;o, Mi&s;s, it has proved &mdash; For, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing my Gentleman, with a&s;&s;uring him, that I had no Ob|jection at all to the Matter, or to parting with <HI>Polly,</HI> as &s;oon as it &s;uited with their Conveniency &mdash; I founded her, and asked, If &s;he thought Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> had any Affection for her?</P>
<P>She &s;aid, He was a very good Gentleman.</P>
<P>I know it, <HI>Polly</HI>; and are you not of Opinion, he loves you a little?</P>
<P>Dear Ma'm, good your Lady&s;hip &mdash; love me! &mdash; I don't know what &s;uch a Gentleman, as Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> &s;hould &s;ee in me, to love me!</P>
<P>Oh! thought I, does the Objection lie on <HI>that</HI> Side then? &mdash; I &s;ee 'tis not of <HI>thine.</HI></P>
<P>Well, but, <HI>Polly,</HI> if you have <HI>another</HI> Sweetheart, you &s;hould do the fair Thing, that you &s;hould; it would be wrong, if you encourag'd any body el&s;e, if you thought of Mr. <HI>Adams.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, Ma'm, I had a Letter &s;ent me &mdash; A Letter that I receiv'd &mdash; from &mdash; from a young Man in <HI>Bedford</HI>; but I never gave an An&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>Oh! thought I, then thou would&s;t not encourage <HI>two at once</HI>; this was as plain a Declaration as I wanted, that &s;he had Thoughts of Mr. <HI>Adams.</HI></P>
<P>But how came Mr. <HI>Adams, Polly,</HI> to know of this Letter?</P>
<P>How came Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> to know of it, Ma'm! &mdash; repeated &s;he &mdash; half &s;urpris'd &mdash; Why, I don't know, I cann't tell how it was &mdash; but I dropp'd it near his Desk &mdash; pulling out my Handkerchief, I believe, Ma'm; and he brought it after me; and gave it me again.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276">Well, thought I, thou'rt an intriguing Slut, I doubt, <HI>Polly &mdash; Delays may breed Dangers,</HI> quoth the poor Gentleman! &mdash; Ah! Girl, Girl! thought I, but did not &s;ay &s;o, thou de&s;erve&s;t to be blown up, and to have thy Plot &s;poiled, that thou do&s;t &mdash; But if thy Forwardne&s;s &s;hould expo&s;e thee afterwards to Evils, which thou may&s;t avoid, if thy Schemes take Place, I &s;hould very much blame my&s;elf.

<P>And &s;o I di&s;mi&s;s'd her, telling her, That whoever thought of being a Clergyman's Wife, &s;hould re&s;olve to be as good as him&s;elf; to &s;et an Example to all her Sex in the Pari&s;h, and &s;hew how much his Doctrines had Weight with her; &s;hould be humble, circum&s;pect, gentle in her Temper and Manners, frugal, not proud, nor vying in Dre&s;s with the Ladies of the Laity; &s;hould re&s;olve to &s;weeten his Labours, and to be obliging in her Deportment to Poor as well as Rich, that her Husband got no Di&s;credit thro' her Means, which would weaken his Influence upon His Auditors; and that &s;he mu&s;t be mo&s;t of all obliging to him, and &s;tudy his Temper, that his Mind might be more di&s;ingag'd, in order to pur&s;ue his Studies with the better Effect.</P>
<P>And &s;o much, my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> for <HI>your</HI> humble Servant; and for Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s matrimonial Pro&s;pects &mdash; And don't think me di&s;re&s;pectful, that I have mention'd my <HI>Polly</HI>'s Affair in the &s;ame Letter with yours.

<HEAD>LETTER XLV. From Mi&s;s <HI>DARNFORD,</HI> in An&s;wer to the preceding.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Mrs.</HI> B.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been &s;everal times (in Company with Mr. <HI>Peters</HI>) to &s;ee Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI> The poor Woman is very bad, and cannot live many Days. We comfort her all we can; but &s;he often accu&s;es her&s;elf of her pa&s;t Behaviour to &s;o excellent a Lady; and, with Ble&s;&s;ings upon Ble&s;&s;ings, heaped upon you, and her Ma&s;ter, and your charming little Boy, &s;he is continually declaring how much your Goodne&s;s to her exa&s;perates her former Faults to her own Con|&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="278">She has her Si&s;ter-in-law and her Niece with her, and has &s;ettled all her Affairs, and thinks &s;he is not long for this World.</P>
<P>Her Di&s;temper is an inward Decay, all at once, as it were, from a Con&s;titution that &s;eem'd like one of Iron; and &s;he is a mere Skeleton: You would not know her, I'm &s;ure.</P>
<P>I will &s;ee her every Day; and &s;he has given me up all her Keys, and Accompts, to give Mr. <HI>Long|man</HI>; who is daily expected, and I hope will be here &s;oon; for her Si&s;ter-in-law, &s;he &s;ays her&s;elf, is a Woman of <HI>this World,</HI> as <HI>&s;he</HI> has been.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> calling on me to go with him to vi&s;it her, I will break off here.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> is much as &s;he was; but your faith|ful Steward is come. I am glad of it &mdash; and &s;o is &s;he. &mdash; Neverthele&s;s I will go every Day, and do all the Good I can for the poor Woman, according to your charitable De&s;ires, and excellent Intentions.</P>
<P>I thank you, Madam, for your Communication of Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s Letter. I am much obliged to my Lord, and her Lady&s;hip; and &s;hould have been proud of an Alliance with that noble Family: But with all Mr. <HI>H.</HI>'s good Qualities, as my Lady paints them out, I could not, for the World, make him my Husband.</P>
<P>I'll tell you one of my Objections, in Confidence tho' (for you are only to <HI>&s;ound</HI> me, you know); and I would not have it mention'd, that I have taken any Thought about the Matter, becau&s;e a &s;tronger Rea&s;on may be given, &s;uch an one as my Lord and Lady will both allow; which I will communicate to you by-and-by.</P>
<P>My Objection ari&s;es even from what you intimate of Mr. <HI>H.</HI>'s Good-humour, and his Per&s;uadable|ne&s;s, if I may &s;o &s;ay. Now, Madam, were I of a boi&s;terous Temper, and high Spirit, &s;uch an one as
<PB N="278" REF="279">
required great Patience in a Husband, to bear with me, then Mr. <HI>H.</HI>'s Character of Good-humour might have been a Con&s;ideration with me. But when I have (I pride my&s;elf in the Thought) a Temper not wholly unlike your own, and &s;uch an one as would not want to contend for Superiority with a Husband, it is no Recommendation to me, that Mr. <HI>H.</HI> is a good-humour'd Gentleman, and will bear with Faults I de&s;ign not to be guilty of.</P>
<P>But, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> my Husband mu&s;t be a Man of Sen&s;e, and mu&s;t give me Rea&s;on to think, he has a &s;uperior Judgment to my own, or I &s;hall be unhappy. He will otherwi&s;e do wrong-headed Things: I &s;hall be forced to oppo&s;e him in them: He will be ob&s;tinate and tenacious, and will be taught to talk of Prerogative, and to call him&s;elf a Man, without knowing how to behave as one, and I to de&s;pi&s;e him of cour&s;e; and &s;o be deem'd a bad Wife, when I hope I have Qualities that would make me a tolerable good one, with a Man of Sen&s;e, for my Husband. You know who &s;ays,
<Q><L>For Fools</L></Q> 
(pardon me this har&s;h Word, 'tis in my Author)
<Q><L>For Fools are &s;tubborn in their Way,</L>
<L>As Coins are harden'd by th' Allay;</L>
<L>And Ob&s;tinacy's ne'er &s;o &s;tiff,</L>
<L>As when 'tis in a wrong Belief.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t not think I would di&s;pen&s;e with real Good-humour in a Man. No, I make it one of my <HI>Indi&s;pen&s;ables</HI> in a Husband. A good-natur'd Man will put the be&s;t Con&s;tructions on what hap|pens: But he mu&s;t have Sen&s;e to <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h</HI> the be&s;t. He will be kind to little, unwilful, unde&s;igned Failings: But he mu&s;t have Judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h what <HI>are</HI> or are <HI>not</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>H.</HI>'s Good-humour is Softne&s;s, as I may call it; and my Husband mu&s;t be &s;uch an one, in
<PB N="279" REF="278">
&s;hort, as I need not be a&s;ham'd to be &s;een with in Company; one, who being my Head, mu&s;t not be beneath all the Gentlemen he may happen to fall in with; and who, every time he is adju&s;ting his Mouth for Speech, will give me Pain at my Heart, and Blu&s;hes in my Face, even before he &s;peaks.</P>
<P>I could not bear, that every Gentleman, and every Lady, we encounter'd, &s;hould be prepar'd&punc; whenever he offer'd to open his Lips, by their con|temptuous Smiles, to expect &s;ome weak and &s;illy Things from him; and when he <HI>had</HI> &s;poken, that he &s;hould, with a booby Grin, &s;eem plea&s;ed that he had not di&s;appointed them.</P>
<P>The only recommendatory Point in Mr. <HI>H.</HI> is, that he dre&s;&s;es exceedingly &s;mart, and is no con|temptible Figure of a Man. But, dear Madam, you know, that's &s;o much the wor&s;e, when the Man's Talent is not Taciturnity, except before his Aunt, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and you; when he is not con&s;cious of internal Defect, and values him&s;elf upon outward Appearance.</P>
<P>As to his Attempt upon your <HI>Polly,</HI> tho' I don't like him the better for it, yet it is a Fault &s;o wickedly common among Gentlemen, that when a Lady re&s;olves never to marry, till a quite virtuous Man addre&s;&s;es her, it is, in other Words, re&s;olving to die &s;ingle: So that I make not this the <HI>chief</HI> Objection; altho', I mu&s;t tell you, I would abate in my Expect|ations of half a dozen other good Qualities, rather than that one of Virtue in a Husband.</P>
<P>But, when I reflect upon the Figure Mr. <HI>H.</HI> made in that Affair, I cannot bear him; and if I may judge of other Coxcombs by him, what Wretches are the&s;e &s;mart, well-dre&s;&s;ing, Querpo-fellows, many of which you and I have &s;een admiring them&s;elves at the Plays and Operas!</P>
<P>This is one of my infallible Rules, and I know it is yours too; That he who is taken up with the
<PB N="280" REF="281">
Admiration of his own &s;weet Per&s;on, will never admire a Wife's. His Delights are centred in him|&s;elf, and he will not wi&s;h to get out of that narrow, that exceeding narrow Circle; and, in my Opinion, &s;hould keep no Company, but that of Tailors, Wig|puffers, and Milaners.</P>
<P>But I will run on no further upon this Subject; but will tell you a Rea&s;on, that you <HI>may</HI> give to Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> why her kind Intentions to me cannot be an&s;wer'd; and which &s;he'll take better than what I <HI>have &s;aid,</HI> were &s;he to know it, as I hope you won't let her: And this is, My Papa has had a Pro|po&s;al made to him from a Gentleman you have &s;een, and have thought polite<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. III. <HI>p.</HI> 257.</NOTE>. It is from Sir <HI>W. G.</HI> of this County, who is one of <HI>your</HI> great Admirers, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s too; and that, you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, makes me have never the wor&s;e Opinion of him, or of his Under&s;tanding; altho' it requires no great Sagacity or Penetration to &s;ee how much you adorn our Sex, and human Nature too.</P>
<P>Every thing was adju&s;ted between my Papa and Mamma, and Sir <HI>William,</HI> on Condition we approv'd of each other, before I came down, which I knew not, till I had &s;een him here four times, and then my Papa &s;urpris'd me into an half Approbation of him: And this, it &s;eems, was one of the Rea&s;ons I was &s;o hurry'd down from you.</P>
<P>I can't &s;ay, but I like the Gentleman as well as mo&s;t I have &s;een; he is a Man of Sen&s;e and Sobri|ety, to give him his Due; and is in very ea&s;y Cir|cum&s;tances, and much re&s;pected by all who know him; and that's no bad Earne&s;t, you are &s;en&s;ible, in a Marriage Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>But hitherto, he &s;eems to like me better than I do him. I don't know how it is; but I have often ob&s;erv'd, that when any thing is in our own Power, we are not half &s;o much taken with it, as we &s;hould
<PB N="281" REF="282">
be, perhaps, if we were kept in Su&s;pen&s;e! Why &s;hould this be?</P>
<P>But this I am convinc'd of, There is no Com|pari&s;on between Sir <HI>William</HI> and Mr. <HI>Murray.</HI></P>
<P>Now I have nam'd this Brother-in-law of mine; what do you think?</P>
<P>Why, that good Couple have had their Hou&s;e on Fire three times already, and that very danger|ou&s;ly too; for once it was put out by Mr. <HI>Murray</HI>'s Mother, who lives near them; and twice Sir <HI>Simon</HI> has been forced to carry Water to extingui&s;h it; for, Truly, Mrs. <HI>Murray</HI> would go home again to her Papa: She would not live with &s;uch a &s;urly Wretch: And it was, With all his Heart: A fair Riddance! for there was no bearing the Hou&s;e with &s;uch an ill-natur'd Wife:&mdash;Her Si&s;ter <HI>Polly</HI> was worth a thou&s;and of her!</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, heartily &s;orry, for their Unhappine&s;s: But could &s;he think every body mu&s;t bear with her, and her fretful Ways?</P>
<P>They'll jangle on, I reckon, till they are better us'd to one another; and when he &s;ees &s;he can't help it, why he'll bear with her, as Husbands gene|rally do with ill-temper'd Wives; that is to &s;ay, he'll try to make him&s;elf happy abroad, and leave her to quarrel with her Maids in&s;tead of him; for &s;he mu&s;t have &s;omebody to vent her Spleen upon; poor <HI>Nancy!</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to hear of Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s good Fortune.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> knows not <HI>Polly</HI>'s Fault, and it was prevented in time, they may be happy enough. She is a <HI>&s;ly</HI> Girl. I always thought her &s;o: Something &s;o innocent, and yet &s;o artful in her very Looks! She is an odd Compound of a Girl. But the&s;e worthy and piou&s;ly turn'd young Gentlemen, who have but ju&s;t quitted the College, are mere Novices, as to the World: indeed, they are <HI>above</HI> it, while <HI>in</HI> it;
<PB N="282" REF="283">
they therefore give them&s;elves little Trouble to &s;tudy it, and &s;o depending on the Goodne&s;s of their own Hearts, are more liable to be impo&s;ed upon, than People of half their Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I think, as he &s;eems to love her, you do right not to hinder the Girl's Fortune. But I wi&s;h &s;he may take your Advice, in her Behaviour to <HI>him,</HI> at lea&s;t; for as to her Carriage to her Neighbours, I doubt &s;he'll be one of the Heads of the Pari&s;h, pre|&s;ently, in her own E&s;timation.</P>
<P>'Tis pity, methinks, any worthy Gentleman of the Cloth &s;hould have a Wife, who, by a bad Ex|ample, &s;hould pull down, as fa&s;t as he, by a good one, can build up.</P>
<P>This is not the Ca&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Peters,</HI> however; who&s;e Example I wi&s;h was more generally follow'd by Gentlewomen, who are made &s;o by marrying a good Clergyman, if they were not &s;o before.</P>
<P>Don't be &s;urpris'd, if you &s;hould hear, that poor <HI>Jewkes</HI> is given over!&mdash;She made a very exem|plary&mdash; Full of Ble&s;&s;ings&mdash; And more ea&s;y and re|&s;ign'd, than I apprehended &s;he would be.</P>
<P>I know you'll &s;hed a Tear for the poor Woman:&mdash; I cann't help it my&s;elf. But you will be pleas'd, that &s;he had &s;o much Time given her, and made &s;o good U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> has been every thing that one would wi&s;h one of his Function to be, in his Attendances, and Advice, to the poor Woman. Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> will take proper Care of every thing.</P>
<P>So, I will only add, That I am, with the &s;incere&s;t Re&s;pects, in Hopes to &s;ee you &s;oon, (for I have a Multitude of things to talk to you about) Dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> Pamela,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> is likely to be &s;o happy in a Husband, as Sir <HI>W. G.</HI> will certainly make her. I was afraid, that the Propo&s;al I made, would not do with Mi&s;s, had &s;he not had &s;o good a Tender. I want <HI>too,</HI> to have the fooli&s;h-Fellow marry'd&mdash; for &s;everal Rea&s;ons; one of which is, He is con|tinually teizing us to permit him to go up to Town, in order for him to re&s;ide there for &s;ome Months, to <HI>&s;ee the World,</HI> as he calls it. But we are con|vinc'd he would <HI>feel</HI> it, as well as <HI>&s;ee</HI> it, if we gave way to his Reque&s;t: For, in Under&s;tanding, Dre&s;s, and incon&s;iderate Vanity, he is &s;o exactly &s;iz'd and cut out for a Town Fop, Coxcomb, or pretty Fel|low, as it is called, that he will undoubtedly fall into all the Vices of tho&s;e People; and, perhaps, having &s;uch Expectations as he has, will be made the Pro|perty of Rakes and Sharpers. He complains, that we u&s;e him like a Child in a Go-cart, or a Baby with Leading-&s;trings, and that he mu&s;t not be tru&s;ted out of our Sight. 'Tis a &s;ad thing, that the&s;e <HI>Bodies</HI> will grow up to the Stature of Men, when the <HI>Minds</HI> improve not at all with them, but are &s;till tho&s;e of Boys and Children. Yet, he would certainly make a fond Husband; for, at pre&s;ent, he has no very bad Qualities. But is &s;uch a <HI>Narci&s;&s;us!</HI>&mdash; But this between our&s;elves; for his Uncle is wrapt up in the Fellow&mdash;And why? Becau&s;e he is good-humour'd, that's all. He has vex'd me lately, which makes me
<PB N="285" REF="286">
write &s;o angrily about him&mdash; But 'tis not worth troubling you with the particulars.</P>
<P>I hope Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> is happy, as you &s;ay! &mdash; Poor Woman! &s;he &s;eemed to promi&s;e for a longer Life! But what &s;hall we &s;ay?</P>
<P>Your Compliment to me, of my <HI>Beck</HI>'s Si&s;ter, is a very kind one. I am greatly obliged to you for it. Mrs. <HI>Oldham</HI> is a &s;ober, grave Widow, a little afore|hand in the World, but not much; has liv'd well; under&s;tands Hou&s;ehold Management thoroughly; is diligent, and has a Turn to &s;erious Things, which will make you like her the better.</P>
<P>I'll order <HI>Beck</HI> and her to wait on you in a Chai&s;e and Pair, and &s;he will &s;atisfy you in every thing, as to what you may, and may not, expect of her.</P>
<P>You cann't think how kindly I take this Motion from you. You forget nothing that can oblige your Friends. Little did think you would remember me, of (what I had forgotten in a manner) my fa|vourable Opinion and Wi&s;hes for her, expre&s;s'd &s;o long ago&mdash; But you are, what you are&mdash; a dear, obliging Creature.</P>
<P><HI>Beck</HI> is all Joy and Gratitude upon it; and her Si&s;ter had rather &s;erve you, than the Prince&s;s. You need be under no Difficulties about Terms: She would &s;erve you for nothing, if you would accept of her Service.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip will &s;ee how I was circum&s;crib'd and limited; otherwi&s;e I would have told the good Lady (what I have mention'd, more than once) how I admire and honour her for her Penitence, and that noble Re&s;olution, which enabled her to do what Thou&s;ands could not have had the Heart to do, abandon her Country, her Relations, Friends, Baby, and all that was dear to her, as well as the wicked Seducer, whom &s;he too well loved, and hazard the Sea, the Dangers of Pirates, and po&s;&s;ibly of other wicked Attempters of the mi&s;chievous Sex, in a World &s;he knew nothing of, among Strangers; and all to avoid repeating a Sin, &s;he had been unhap|pily drawn into; and for which the dear good Lady &s;till abhors her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="296">Mu&s;t not &s;uch a Lady as this, dear Madam, have as much Merit, as many even of tho&s;e, who, having not had her Temptations, have not fallen? This, at lea&s;t, one may aver, that next to not committing an Error, is certainly the Re&s;olution to retrieve it all that one may, to repent of it, and &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid the Repetition of it. But who, be&s;ides this excellent Mrs. <HI>Wright&s;on,</HI> having &s;o fallen, and, being &s;till &s;o ardently &s;olicited and pur&s;ued (and flatter'd, perhaps, by fond Hopes, that her Spoiler would, one Day, do her all the Ju&s;tice he <HI>could</HI>&mdash; For who, can do complete Ju&s;tice to a Lady he has robb'd of her Honour)&mdash; could re&s;olve as &s;he re&s;olved, and act as &s;he acted?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s is a &s;weet pretty Dear; but permit me to &s;ay, has a little of her Papa's Spirit; ha&s;ty, yet gene|rous and acknowleging, when &s;he is convinc'd of her Fault; a little haughtier and prouder than I wi&s;h her to be; but in every thing el&s;e de&s;erves the Character I give of her to her Mamma.</P>
<P>She is very fond of fine Cloaths, is a little too lively to the Servants&mdash; Told me once, when I took notice, that Softne&s;s and Mildne&s;s of Speech be|came a young Lady; That they were <HI>but</HI> Servants; and &s;he could &s;ay no more, than <HI>Pray,</HI> and <HI>I de&s;ire,</HI> and <HI>I wish you'd be &s;o kind</HI>&mdash;to her Uncle or to me.</P>
<P>I told her, Our Servants were not common Ser|vants, and de&s;erved any civil Di&s;tinctions; and that &s;o long as they were ready to oblige her in every thing, by a kind Word, it would be very wrong to give them imperative ones, which could &s;erve for no other End, but to convince every one of the Haughtine&s;s of one's own Temper; and looked, as if one would que&s;tion their Compliance with one's own Will, unle&s;s we would exact it with an high Hand; which might ca&s;t a Slur upon the Com|mand we gave, as if we thought it was hardly &s;o
<PB N="296" REF="297">
rea&s;onable, as otherwi&s;e to obtain their Ob&s;ervation of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, my Dear, &s;aid I, you don't con&s;ider, that if you &s;peak as haughtily and commandingly to them on common, as on extraordinary Occa&s;ions, you weaken your own Authority, if ever you &s;hould be permitted to have any, and they'll regard you no more in the one Ca&s;e, than in the other.</P>
<P>She takes great Notice of what I &s;ay, and when her little proud Heart is &s;ubdued by Rea&s;onings &s;he cannot an&s;wer, &s;he will &s;it as if &s;he were &s;tudying what to &s;ay, that &s;he may come off as flyingly as &s;he can: And as the Ca&s;e requires, I let her off ea&s;ily, or I pu&s;h the little Dear to her la&s;t Refuge, and make her quit her Po&s;t, and yield up her Spirit, captive to Rea&s;on and Di&s;cretion, two excellent Commanders, with whom, I tell her, I mu&s;t bring her to be intimately acquainted.</P>
<P>Yet, after all, till I can be &s;ure, that I can in&s;pire her with the Love of Virtue, for <HI>its own</HI> Sake, I will rather try to conduct her Spirit to proper Ends, than endeavour totally to &s;ubdue it; being &s;en&s;ible our Pa&s;&s;ions are given us for excellent Ends, and may, by a proper Direction, be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the noble&s;t Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>I tell her &s;ometimes, there is a decent Pride in Hu|mility, and that it is very po&s;&s;ible for a young Lady to behave with &s;o much <HI>true</HI> Dignity, as &s;hall com|mand Re&s;pect by the Turn of her Eye, &s;ooner than by A&s;perity of Speech; and that &s;he may depend upon it, that the Per&s;on who is always finding Faults, fre|quently cau&s;es them; and that it is no Glory to be better born than Servants, if &s;he is not better be|hav'd too.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I tell her, Humility is a Grace that &s;hines in an <HI>high</HI> Condition, but cannot equally in a <HI>low</HI> one; becau&s;e that is already too much humbled, perhaps:
<PB N="297" REF="298">
And that, tho' there is a Cen&s;ure lies again&s;t being <HI>poor and proud,</HI> yet I would rather forgive Pride in a poor Body, than in a rich; for in the Rich it is In&s;ult and Arrogance, proceeding from their high Condition; but in the Poor it may be a Defen&s;ative again&s;t Di&s;hone&s;ty, and may &s;hew a natural Bravery of Mind, perhaps, if properly directed, and manife&s;ted on right Occa&s;ions, that the Frowns of Fortune cannot depre&s;s.</P>
<P>She &s;ays, She hears every Day Things from me, that her Governe&s;s never taught her.</P>
<P>That may very well be, I tell her, becau&s;e her Governe&s;s has <HI>many</HI> young Ladies to take care of, I but <HI>one</HI>; and that I want to make her wi&s;e and prudent betimes, that &s;he may be an Example to other Mi&s;&s;es; and that Governe&s;&s;es and Mamma's &s;hall &s;ay to their Mi&s;&s;es, When will you be like Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin?</HI> Do you ever hear Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI> &s;ay a naughty Word? Would Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> think you, have done &s;o or &s;o?</P>
<P>She threw her Arms about my Neck, on one &s;uch Occa&s;ion as this: Oh, &s;aid &s;he, What a charming Mamma have I got! I will be in every thing as like you, Madam, as ever I can!&mdash; And then You will love me, and &s;o will my Uncle, and Every-body el&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> whom, now-and-then &s;he &s;ays, &s;he loves as well as if he were her own Papa, &s;ees, with Plea&s;ure, how we go on; and loves us both, if po&s;&s;ible, better and better. But &s;he tells me, I mu&s;t not have any Daughter but her&punc; and is very jealous on the Oc|ca&s;ion, about which your Lady&s;hip &s;o kindly re|proaches me.</P>
<P>There is a Pride, you know, Madam, in &s;ome of our Sex, that &s;erves to u&s;eful Purpo&s;es, and is a good Defence again&s;t improper Matches, and mean Actions; and this is not wholly to be &s;ubdu'd, for that
<PB N="298" REF="299">

So I will not quite di&s;courage my dear Pupil neither, till I &s;ee what Di&s;cretion, and riper Years, may add to her di&s;tingui&s;hing Faculty. For, as &s;ome have no No|tion of Pride, &s;eparate from Imperiou&s;ne&s;s and Ar|rogance; &s;o others know no Difference between Humility and Meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a golden Mean in every thing; and if it plea&s;e God to &s;pare us both, I will endeavour to point her Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch even of tho&s;e Foibles, which &s;eem too deeply rooted to be &s;oon eradicated, to u&s;eful Purpo&s;es, chu&s;ing to imitate Phy&s;icians, who in certain Chronical Illne&s;&s;es, as I have read in Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> rather proceed by Palliatives, than by har&s;h Ex|tirpatives, which, thro' the Re&s;i&s;tance given to them by the Con&s;titution, may create &s;uch Ferments in it, as may de&s;troy that Health it was their Intention to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>But, whither am I running?&mdash; Your Lady&s;hip, I hope, will excu&s;e this parading Freedom of my Pen: For tho' the&s;e Notions are well enough with regard to Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> they mu&s;t be very imper|tinent to a Lady, who can &s;o much better in&s;truct Mi&s;s's Tutore&s;s, than that vain Tutore&s;s can her Pu|pil.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Lady</HI> Davers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have Three Marriages to acquaint you with, in One Letter. In the fir&s;t Place, Sir <HI>W. G.</HI> has &s;ent, by the particular De&s;ire of my dear Friend, that he was made one of the happie&s;t Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI> on the 18th pa&s;t; and &s;o I have no longer any Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> to boa&s;t of. I have a very good Opinion of the Gentleman; but if he be but half as good an Husband, as &s;he will make a Wife, they will be exceedingly happy in one an|other.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s Marriage to a Kin&s;woman of his Noble Patron, (as you have heard was in Treaty) is the next; and there is great Rea&s;on to believe from the Character of both, that they will likewi&s;e do Credit to the State.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="301">The third is Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> and <HI>Polly Barlow</HI>; and I wi&s;h them, for both their Sakes, as happy as either of the former. They are &s;et out to his Liv|ing, highly pleas'd with one another; and I hope will have Rea&s;on to continue &s;o to be.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, I did not indeed think, the Affair would have been &s;o &s;oon concluded; and Mi&s;s kept it off &s;o long, as I under&s;tand, that her Papa was angry with her: And indeed, as the Gentleman's Family, Circum&s;tances, and Character, were &s;uch, that there could lie no Objection again&s;t him, I think it would have been wrong to have delay'd it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have written to your Lady&s;hip before; but have been favour'd with Mr. <HI>B.'s</HI> Company into <HI>Kent,</HI> on a Vi&s;it to my good Mother, who was in|di&s;pos'd. We tarry'd there a Week, and left both my dear Parents, to my thankful Satisfaction, in as good Health as ever they were in their Lives.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Judy Swynford,</HI> or Mi&s;s <HI>Swynford</HI> (as &s;he refu&s;es not being call'd, now-and-then) has been with us for this Week pa&s;t, and &s;he expects her Brother, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> to fetch her away about a Week hence.</P>
<P>It does not become me to write the lea&s;t Word, that may appear di&s;re&s;pectful of any Per&s;on, who has the Honour to bear a Relation to your Lady|&s;hip and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> Otherwi&s;e I &s;hould &s;ay, That the <HI>B.'s</HI> and the <HI>S&mdash;s</HI> are directly the Oppo&s;ites of one another. But yet, as &s;he &s;ays, &s;he never &s;aw your Lady&s;hip but once, you will forgive me to mention a Word or two about this Lady, becau&s;e &s;he is a Character, that is in a manner new to me.</P>
<P>She is a Maiden Lady, as you know, Madam; and tho' &s;he will not part with the green Leaf from her Hand, one &s;ees by the Grey-goo&s;e Down on her Brows and her Head, that &s;he cannot be le&s;s than Fifty-five.&mdash; But &s;o much Pains does &s;he take,
<PB N="301" REF="302">
by Powder, to have never a dark Hair in her Head, becau&s;e &s;he has one Half of them white, that I am &s;orry to &s;ee, what is a Subject for Reverence, &s;hould be deem'd, by the good Lady, Matter of Conceal|ment.</P>
<P>She is often, in Conver&s;ation, indeed, &s;eemingly reproaching her&s;elf, that &s;he is an <HI>old Maid,</HI> and an <HI>old Woman</HI>; but it is very di&s;cernible, that &s;he expects a Compliment, that &s;he is <HI>not &s;o,</HI> every time &s;he is &s;o free with her&s;elf: And if nobody makes her one, &s;he will &s;ay &s;omething of that &s;ort in her own Behalf.</P>
<P>She takes particular Care, that of all the publick Tran&s;actions which happen to be talked of, her Me|mory will never carry her back above Thirty Years, and then it is, About Thirty Years ago, when I was a Girl, or, when I was in Hanging-&s;leeves; and &s;o &s;he makes her&s;elf, for Twenty Years of her Life, a very u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant Per&s;on.</P>
<P>If her Teeth, which, for her Time of Life, are very good, tho' not over-white, (and which, by the Care &s;he takes of them, &s;he &s;eems to look upon as the la&s;t Remains of her better Days) would but fail her, I imagine it would help her to a Conviction, that would &s;et her Ten Years forwarder at lea&s;t. But, poor Lady! &s;he is &s;o <HI>young,</HI> in Spite of her Wrinkles, that I am really concern'd for her Affectation; be|cau&s;e it expo&s;es her to the Remarks and Ridicule of the Gentlemen, and gives one Pain for her.</P>
<P>Surely, the&s;e Ladies don't act prudently at all; &s;ince, for every Year Mrs. <HI>Judy</HI> would take from her Age, her Cen&s;urers add two to it; and, be|hind her Back, make her going on towards Seventy; whereas, if &s;he would lay Claim to her <HI>Reve|rentials,</HI> as I may &s;ay, and not endeavour to con|ceal her Age, &s;he would have a great many Com|pliments for looking &s;o well at her Time of Life.
<PB N="302" REF="303">
And many a young Body would hope to be the better for her Advice and Experience, who now are afraid of affronting her, if they &s;uppo&s;e &s;he has lived much longer in the World than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Then &s;he laughs back to the Years &s;he owns, when more flippant Ladies, at the Laughing-time of Life, delight to be frolick: She tries to &s;ing too, altho', if ever &s;he had a Voice, &s;he has outliv'd it; and her Songs are of &s;o antique a Date, that they would betray her; only as &s;he tells us, they were learnt her by her Grandmother, who was a fine Lady at the Re&s;toration: She will join in a Dance; and tho' her Limbs move not &s;o pliantly, as might be expected of a Lady no older than &s;he would be thought to be, and who&s;e Dancing-days are not intirely over, yet that was owing to a Fall from her Hor&s;e &s;ome Years ago, which, &s;he doubts, &s;he &s;hall never recover, &s;o as to be quite well; tho' &s;he finds &s;he grows better and better <HI>every Year.</HI></P>
<P>Thus &s;he lo&s;es the Re&s;pect, the Reverence, &s;he might receive, were it not for this mi&s;erable Affecta|tion; takes Pains, by aping Youth, to make her&s;elf unworthy of her Years, and even le&s;s valuably di&s;creet than &s;he would be thought, for fear &s;he &s;hould be imagined older, if &s;he appear'd wi&s;er.</P>
<P>What a &s;ad Thing is this, Madam?&mdash;What a mi&s;taken Conduct?&mdash;We pray to live to old Age; and it is promi&s;ed as a Ble&s;&s;ing, and as a Reward, for the Performance of certain Duties; and yet, when we come to it, we had rather be thought as fooli&s;h as Youth, than to be deemed wi&s;e, and in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. And &s;o we &s;hew how little we de&s;erve what we have been &s;o long coveting; and yet covet on: For what? Why, to be more and more a&s;ham'd, and more and more unworthy of what we covet!</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="304">How fanta&s;tick a Character is this! &mdash;Well may irreverent, unthinking Youth de&s;pi&s;e, in&s;tead of revering, the hoary Head, which the Wearer is &s;o much a&s;ham'd of.</P>
<P>Will you forgive me, Madam? The Lady boa&s;ts a Relation&s;hip to you, and to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and, I think, I am very bold. But my Reverence for Years, and the Di&s;gu&s;t I have to &s;ee any Body behave unworthy of them, makes me take the greater Liberty: Which, however, I &s;hall wi&s;h I had not taken, if it meets not with that Allowance, which I have always had from your Lady&s;hip in what I write.</P>
<P>God knows whether ever I may enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ing I &s;o much revere in others. For now my heavy Time approaches. But I was &s;o apprehen&s;ive before, and &s;o trouble&s;ome to my be&s;t Friends, with my vapouri&s;h Fears, that now (with a perfect Re&s;igna|tion to the Divine Will) I will only add, That I am</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM once more, ble&s;&s;ed be God for all his Mercies to me! enabled to dedicate to you the fir&s;t Fruits of my Penman&s;hip, on my Up&s;it|ting,
<PB N="304" REF="305">
to thank you, and my noble Lord, for all your kind Solicitudes for my Welfare. <HI>Billy</HI> every Day improves, Mi&s;s is all I wi&s;h her to be, and my &s;econd dear Boy continues to be as lovely and as fine a Baby as your Lady&s;hip was plea&s;ed to think him; and their Papa, the be&s;t of Gentlemen, and of Husbands!</P>
<P>I am glad to hear Lady <HI>Betty</HI> is likely to be &s;o happy. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, her noble Admirer is as wor|thy a Gentleman as the Peerage boa&s;ts; and I beg of your Lady&s;hip to congratulate the dear Lady, and her noble Parents, in my Name, if I &s;hould be at a Di&s;tance, when the Nuptials are celebrated.</P>
<P>I have had the Honour of a Vi&s;it from my Lady, the Counte&s;s Dowager, on Occa&s;ion of her leaving the Kingdom for one Year, for which Space &s;he de&s;igns to re&s;ide in <HI>Italy</HI>; principally at <HI>Naples</HI> or <HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was abroad when her Lady&s;hip came, having taken a Turn to <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> the Day before, and I expected him not till the next Day. Her Lady&s;hip &s;ent her Gentleman, the preceding Even|ing, to let me know, that Bu&s;ine&s;s had brought her as far as <HI>Wooburn</HI>; and if it would not be unaccept|able, &s;he would pay her Re&s;pects to me, at Break|fa&s;t, the next Morning, being &s;peedily to leave <HI>England.</HI> I return'd, that I &s;hould be very proud of that Honour. And about Ten her Lady&s;hip came.</P>
<P>She was exceedingly fond of my two Boys, the little Man, and the pretty Baby, as &s;he called them; and I had very different Emotions from the Expre&s;|&s;ion of her Love to them, and her Vi&s;it to me, from what I had once before. She was &s;orry, &s;he &s;aid, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was abroad; tho' her Bu&s;ine&s;s was princi|pally with me. For, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid &s;he, I come to tell you all that pa&s;s'd between Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and my&s;elf, that you may not think wor&s;e of either of us than
<PB N="305" REF="306">
we de&s;erve; and I could not leave <HI>England,</HI> till I had done my&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of waiting on you for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I was very &s;orry, I had ever been unea&s;y, when I had two Per&s;ons of &s;o much Honour &mdash; Nay, &s;aid &s;he, interrupting me, you have no need to apologize: Things look'd bad enough, as they were repre&s;ented to you, to ju&s;tify greater Unea&s;i|ne&s;s than you expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>She ask'd me, Who that pretty genteel Mi&s;s was? &mdash; I &s;aid, a Relation of Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> who was intru&s;ted lately to my Care. Then, Mi&s;s, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, and ki&s;&s;ed her, you are very happy.</P>
<P>Believing the Counte&s;s was de&s;irous of being alone with me, I &s;aid, My dear Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> won't you go to your little Nur&s;ery, my Love? For &s;o &s;he calls my la&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing &mdash; You'd be &s;orry the Baby &s;hould cry for you &mdash; For Mi&s;s was &s;o taken with the charming Lady, that &s;he was loth to leave us &mdash; But on my &s;aying this, withdrew.</P>
<P>When we were alone, the Counte&s;s began her Story with a &s;weet Confu&s;ion, that added to her Loveline&s;s. She &s;aid, She would be brief, becau&s;e &s;he &s;hould exact all my Attention, and not &s;uffer me to interrupt her till &s;he had done.</P>
<P>She began with acknowleging,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That &s;he thought, when &s;he &s;aw Mr. <HI>B.</HI> fir&s;t at the Ma&s;querade, that he was the fine&s;t Gentleman &s;he had ever &s;een; that the allow'd Freedoms of the Place had made her take Liberties in following him, and engaging him where-ever he went. She blamed him very freely for pa&s;&s;ing for a &s;ingle Gentleman; for, that &s;he &s;aid, as &s;he had &s;o &s;plendid a Fortune of her own, was all &s;he was &s;olicitous about; having never, as &s;he confe&s;s'd, &s;een a Gentleman &s;he could like &s;o well; her former Marriage having been in
<PB N="306" REF="307">
&s;ome &s;ort forced upon her, at an Age, when &s;he knew not how to di&s;tingui&s;h; and that &s;he was very loth to believe him marry'd, even when &s;he had no Rea&s;on to doubt it. Yet, this, I mu&s;t &s;ay, Madam, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, I never heard a Gentle|man, when he owned he was married, expre&s;s him|&s;elf of a Lady, with more affectionate Regard and Fondne&s;s, than he, when he &s;poke of you to me; which made me long to &s;ee you: For I had a great Opinion of tho&s;e per&s;onal Advantages, which every one flatter'd me with: And I was very un|willing to yield the Palm of Beauty to you.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I believe you will cen&s;ure me, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid &s;he, for permitting his Vi&s;its, after I knew how happy he was in &s;uch a Lady &mdash; the&s;e were her Words. To be &s;ure, that was a thoughtle&s;s and a faulty Conduct in me &mdash; But the World's &s;aucy Cen&s;ures, and my Friends indi&s;creet Interpo&s;als, incen&s;ed me; and, knowing the Uprightne&s;s of my own Heart, I was re&s;olved to di&s;regard both, when I found they could not think wor&s;e of me than they did.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am naturally, &s;aid &s;he, of a haughty Spirit, impatient of Contradiction, always gave my&s;elf Freedoms, for which, &s;atisfy'd with my own Innocence and Honour, I thought my&s;elf above being accountable to any body &mdash; And then Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has &s;uch noble Sentiments, a Courage and Fearle&s;s|ne&s;s, which I &s;aw on more Occa&s;ions than one, that all Ladies, who know the Weakne&s;s of their own Sex, and how much they want the Protection of the Brave, are taken with. Then his per&s;onal Addre&s;s was &s;o peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hing, that hav|ing an Opinion of his Honour, I was imbara&s;s'd greatly how to deny my&s;elf his Conver&s;ation; altho', you'll pardon me, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> I began to be afraid,
<PB N="307" REF="308">
that my Honour might &s;uffer in the World's Opi|nion for the Indulgence.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then, &s;aid &s;he, when I had re&s;olv'd, as &s;everal times was the Ca&s;e, to &s;ee him no more, &s;ome unfore&s;een Accident threw him in my way again, at one publick Entertainment or other; for I love Balls, and Concerts, and publick Diver&s;ions, per|haps, better than I ought; and I had all my Re&s;olves to begin again.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yet this, &s;aid &s;he, I can truly &s;ay, whatever his Views were, I never heard from his Lips the lea&s;t indecent Expre&s;&s;ion, nor &s;aw in his Behaviour to me, aught that might make me very appre|hen&s;ive; &s;aving, that I began to fear, that by his in&s;inuating Addre&s;s, and noble Manner, I &s;hould be too much in his Power, and too little in my own, if I went on &s;o little doubting, and &s;o little alarm'd, if ever he &s;hould pull off the Mask, and avow di&s;honourable De&s;igns.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I had often lamented, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, that our Sex were prohibited, by the De&s;igns of the other upon their Honour, and by the World's Cen&s;ures, from conver&s;ing with the &s;ame Ea&s;e and Freedom with Gentlemen, as with one another. And when once I asked my&s;elf, To what this Con|ver&s;ation might tend at la&s;t? And where the Plea|&s;ure each &s;eem'd to take in the other's might po&s;&s;ibly end? I re&s;olv'd to break it off; and told him my Re&s;olution next time I &s;aw him. But he &s;topp'd my Mouth with a romantick Notion, as I &s;ince think it, (tho' a &s;orry Plea will have Weight in favour of a Propo&s;al one has no Aver|&s;ion to) of <HI>Platonick</HI> Love; and we had an Intercour&s;e by Letters, to the Number of Six or Eight, I believe, on that and other Subjects.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All this time, I was the le&s;s apprehen&s;ive, con|tinued her Lady&s;hip, becau&s;e he always &s;poke &s;o
<PB N="308" REF="309">
tenderly, and even with Delight, whenever he mention'd his Lady; and I could not find, that you were at all alarm'd at our Acquaintance; for I never &s;crupled to &s;end my Letters, by my own Livery, to your Hou&s;e, &s;ealed with my own Seal.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At la&s;t, indeed, he began to tell me, that from the &s;weete&s;t and the evene&s;t Temper in the World, you &s;eem'd to be leaning towards Melancholy, were always in Tears, or &s;hew'd you had been weeping, when he came home; and that you did not make his Return to you &s;o agreeable as he u&s;ed to find it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I asked, If it was not owing to &s;ome Alteration in his own Temper? If you might not be unea&s;y at our Acquaintance? And at his frequent Ab&s;ence from you, and the like? He an&s;wer'd, No!&mdash; that you were above Di&s;gui&s;es, were of a noble and frank Nature, and would have taken &s;ome Oppor|tunity to hint it to him, if you had.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This, however, gave me but little Satisfaction, and I began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of the Matter, and was more and more convinced, that my Honour requir'd it of me, to break off this Intimacy.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And altho' I permitted Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to go with me to <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> when I went to take a Hou&s;e there, yet I was unea&s;y, as he &s;aw.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His Unea&s;ine&s;s, he told me, was upon your Account, and he &s;ent you a Letter to excu&s;e him&s;elf for not waiting on you on <HI>Saturday,</HI> and

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is there no Rea&s;on, think you, &s;aid I, continu'd the Counte&s;s, to imagine, that your Acquaintance and mine gives her Unea&s;ine&s;s?

<P>In this manner the Counte&s;s concluded her Nar|rative; and I told her, That I was greatly obliged to her Lady&s;hip for the Honour &s;he did me in this Vi&s;it, and the kind and con&s;iderate Occa&s;ion of it: But that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> had made me intirely happy in every Particular, and had done her Lady&s;hip the Ju&s;tice &s;he &s;o well de&s;erv'd, having taken upon him|&s;elf the Blame of pa&s;&s;ing as a &s;ingle Gentleman, at his fir&s;t Acquaintance with her Lady&s;hip.</P>

con&s;ider'd, thought her a bad Wife; and her Lord's Goodne&s;s to her, at his Death, had demon&s;trated his own favourable Opinion of her by Deeds, as he had done by Words, upon all Occa&s;ions: But that &s;he was yet young; a little too gay and un&s;ettled; and had her Head turn'd towards <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> for one Tour, of a Year at lea&s;t, having pa&s;s'd &s;ome Time in tho&s;e Countries, which &s;he thought of with Plea&s;ure, tho' then but a Girl of Twelve or Thir|teen: That for this Rea&s;on, and having been on a late Occa&s;ion &s;till more un&s;ettled, (looking down with Blu&s;hes, which often overspread her lovely Face, as &s;he talked) &s;he had refu&s;ed &s;ome Offers, not de&s;pi&s;able: That, indeed, Lord <HI>C</HI>&mdash; threatened to follow her to <HI>Italy,</HI> in hopes of meeting better Succe&s;s there; but if he did, tho' &s;he would make no Re&s;olutions, &s;he believ'd &s;he &s;hould be too much offended with him, to give him Rea&s;on to boa&s;t of his Journey.</P>
<P>She wi&s;h'd to &s;ee Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and to take Leave of him, but not out of my Company, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay.

And if your Lady&s;hip will give me the Plea&s;ure of knowing when it will be mo&s;t acceptable, I will beg of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to oblige me with his Company to return this Favour, the fir&s;t Vi&s;it I make abroad.</P>
<P>You are very kind, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid &s;he: But I think to go to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> for a Fortnight, when I have di&s;po&s;ed of every thing for my Imbarkation, and &s;o &s;et out from thence. And if you &s;hould then be both in <HI>Kent,</HI> I &s;hould be glad to take you at your Word.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, I &s;aid, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> at lea&s;t, would attend her Lady&s;hip there, if any thing &s;hould happen to deprive me of that Honour; and if it would be

<P>You are a generous Lady! &s;aid the Counte&s;s &mdash; I take great Concern to my&s;elf, for having been the Means of giving you a Moment's Unea&s;ine&s;s for|merly: But I mu&s;t now endeavour to be circum&s;pect, in order to retrieve my Character, which has been &s;o ba&s;ely traduc'd by that pre&s;umptuous Fellow <HI>Turner,</HI> that was her Word, who hoped, I &s;uppo&s;e, thereby to bring me down to his Level.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip would not be prevailed upon to &s;tay Dinner, and &s;aying, She &s;hould be at <HI>Wooburn</HI> all the next Day, took a very kind and tender Leave of me, wi&s;hing me all manner of Happine&s;s, as I did her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> came home in the Evening, and next Morning rode to <HI>Wooburn,</HI> to pay his Re&s;pects to the Counte&s;s, and came back in the Evening. Thus happily, and to the Satisfaction of all Three, as I hope, ended this perplexing Affair.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> asks me, Madam, How I reli&s;h Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s <HI>Treati&s;e of Education?</HI> which he put into my Hands &s;ome time &s;ince, as I told your Lady&s;hip. I an&s;wer'd, Very well; and I thought it an excellent Piece, in the main.</P>
<P>I'll tell you, &s;aid he, what you &s;hall do. You have not &s;hew'd me any thing you have written for a good while. I would be glad, you would fill up your Lei&s;ure-time, as you cannot be without Pen and Ink, with your Ob&s;ervations on that Treati&s;e, that I may know what you can object to it; for you &s;ay, <HI>In the main,</HI> which &s;hews, that you do not intirely approve of every Part of it.</P>
<P>But will not that be pre&s;umptuous, Sir?</P>
<P>I admire Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> reply'd he; and I admire my <HI>Pamela.</HI> I have no Doubt of his Excellencies;

<P>As to my&s;elf, Sir, &s;aid I, who, in the early Part of my Life, have not been brought up too tenderly, you will hardly meet with any Objection to the Part which I imagine you have heard mo&s;t objected to by Ladies who have been more indulgently treated in their fir&s;t Stage. But there are a few other Things that want clearing up to my Under&s;tanding; but which, however, may be the Fault of that.</P>
<P>Then, my Dear, &s;uppo&s;e me at a Di&s;tance from you, cannot you give me your Remarks in the &s;ame manner as if you were writing to Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> or Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> that was?</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, depending on your kind Favour to me, I believe I could.</P>
<P>Do then, return'd he; and the le&s;s Re&s;traint you write with, the more I &s;hall be plea&s;ed with it. But I confine you not to Time or Place. We will make our Excur&s;ions as I once propo&s;ed to you; and do you write me a Letter now-and-then upon the Subject; for the Places and Remarkables you will &s;ee, will be new only to your&s;elf; nor will either of tho&s;e Ladies expect from you an Itinerary, or a particular De&s;cription of Countries, which they will find better de&s;cribed by Authors, who have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to treat upon tho&s;e Subjects. By this Means, you will be u&s;efully imploy'd in your own way, which may turn to good Account to us both, and to the dear Children, which it may plea&s;e God to be&s;tow upon us.</P>
<P>You don't expect, Sir, any thing regular or dige&s;ted from me?</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="316">I don't, my Dear. Let your Fancy and your Judgment be both imploy'd; and I require no Method; for I know, in your ea&s;y, natural way, that would be a Confinement, that would cramp your Genius, and give what you write a &s;tiff, formal Air, that I might expect in a Pedagogue, but not in my <HI>Pamela.</HI></P>
<P>Well, but, Sir, &s;aid I, altho' I may write nothing to the Purpo&s;e, yet if Lady <HI>Davers</HI> is de&s;irous to give it a Reading, will you allow me to tran&s;mit, what I &s;hall write, to her Hands, when you have perus'd it your&s;elf?

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My deare&s;t Mr.</HI> B:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been con&s;idering of your Commands, in relation to Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Book; and as you are pleas'd to give me Time to acquit my&s;elf of the Task, I &s;hall take the Liberty to propo&s;e to include in a little Book my humble Sentiments, as I did to
<PB N="316" REF="317">
Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> in that I &s;hew'd you in relation to the Plays I had &s;een. And, &s;ince you confine me not to Time or Place, perhaps, I &s;hall be three or four Years in completing it, becau&s;e I &s;hall re&s;erve &s;ome Subjects to my further Experience in Chil|drens Ways and Tempers, and in order to benefit my&s;elf by tho&s;e good Le&s;&s;ons and In&s;tructions, which I &s;hall receive from your delightful Conver&s;ation, in that Compa&s;s of Time, if God &s;pare us to one another: And then it will, moreover, be more worthy, than it can otherwi&s;e be, of the Peru&s;al of the mo&s;t honour'd and be&s;t-beloved of all my Cor|re&s;pondents, much honour'd and beloved, as they all are.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that this is a Subject to which I was always particularly attentive; and among the Charities your bountiful Heart permits me to di&s;pen&s;e to the Poor and Indigent, I have had always a watchful Eye upon the Children of &s;uch, and endeavour'd, by Que&s;tions put to them, as well as to their Parents, to inform my&s;elf of their little Ways and Tempers, and how Nature delights to work in different Minds, and how it might be pointed to their Good, according to their re&s;pective Capa|cities; and I have for this Purpo&s;e erected, with your Approbation, a little School of Seven or Eight Children, among which are Four in the earlie&s;t Stages, when they can but ju&s;t &s;peak, and call for what they want, or love: And I am not a little pleas'd to ob&s;erve, when I vi&s;it them in their School-time, that Principles of Goodne&s;s and Virtue may be in&s;till'd into their little Hearts much earlier than is u&s;ually imagin'd. And why &s;hould it not be &s;o? For may not the Child, that can tell its Wants, and make known its Inclination, be ea&s;ily made &s;en&s;ible of <HI>yours,</HI> and what you expect from it, provided you take a proper Method? For, &s;ome|times,
<PB N="317" REF="318">
Signs and Tokens, (and even Looks) uni|formly practis'd, will do as well as Words; as we &s;ee in &s;uch of the Young of the Brute Creation, as we are di&s;pos'd to dome&s;ticate, and to teach to practi&s;e tho&s;e little Tricks, of which the Aptne&s;s or Docility of their Natures makes them capable.</P>
<P>But yet, deare&s;t Sir, I know not enough of the next Stage, or the <HI>maturer</HI> Life, to touch upon that, as I wi&s;h to do; and yet there is a natural Connection and Progre&s;&s;ion from the one to the other: And I would not be thought a vain Crea|ture, who believes her&s;elf equal to <HI>every</HI> Subject, becau&s;e &s;he is indulg'd with the good Opinions of her Friends, in a <HI>few,</HI> that are &s;uppo&s;ed to be within her own Capacity. For,</P>
<P>I humbly conceive, that it is no &s;mall Point of Wi&s;dom to know, and not to mi&s;take, one's own Talents; and for this Rea&s;on, permit me, dear Sir, to &s;u&s;pend, till I am better qualify'd for it, even my own Propo&s;al of beginning my little Book; and, in the mean time, to touch upon a few Places of the admirable Author you have put into my Hand, that &s;eem to me to warrant another way of Thinking, than that which he pre&s;cribes.</P>
<P>But, dear Sir, let me premi&s;e, that all that your dear Babies can demand of my Attention for &s;ome time to come, is their Health; and it has pleas'd God to ble&s;s them with &s;uch &s;ound Limbs, and, to all Appearance, good Con&s;titutions, that I have very little to do, but to pray for them every time I pray for their dear Papa; and that is hourly, and yet not &s;o often as you confer upon me Benefits, and Fa|vours, and new Obligations, even to the Prevention of all my Wi&s;hes, were I to &s;it down to &s;tudy for what mu&s;t be the next.</P>
<P>As to this Point of <HI>Health,</HI> Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> gives the&s;e plain and ea&s;y to be ob&s;erved Rules.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="319">He pre&s;cribes, Fir&s;t, <HI>Plenty of open Air.</HI> That this is right, the Infant will inform one, who, tho' it cannot &s;peak, will make Signs to be carry'd abroad, and is never &s;o well pleas'd, as when it is enjoying the open and free Air; for which Rea&s;on I con|clude, that this is one of tho&s;e natural Pointings, as one may call it, that is implanted in every Creature, teaching it to chu&s;e its Good, and to avoid its Evil.</P>
<P><HI>Sleep</HI> is the next, which he injoins to be indulg'd to its utmo&s;t Extent: An admirable Rule, as I humbly conceive; &s;ince &s;ound Sleep is one of the greate&s;t Nouri&s;hers in Nature, both to the <HI>once</HI> Young, and to the <HI>twice</HI> Young, if I may &s;o phra&s;e it. And I the rather approve this Rule to Children, becau&s;e it keeps the Nur&s;e unimploy'd, who other|wi&s;e, perhaps, would be doing it the greate&s;t Mi&s;|chief, by cramming and &s;tuffing its little Bowels, till they were ready to bur&s;t. And, if I am right, what an incon&s;iderate and fooli&s;h, as well as pernicious Practice is it, for a Nur&s;e to <HI>waken</HI> the Child from its nouri&s;hing Sleep, for fear it &s;hould &s;uffer by Hunger, and in&s;tantly pop the Brea&s;t into its pretty Mouth, or provoke it to feed, when it has no Incli|nation to either; and, for want of Dige&s;tion, mu&s;t have its Nutriment turn to Repletion, and bad Humours!</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, dear Sir, the&s;e le&s;&s;er Particulars. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> begins with them; and &s;urely they may be allow'd to a young <HI>Mamma,</HI> writing (however it be to a Gentleman of Genius and Learning) to a <HI>Papa,</HI> on a Subject, that in its lowe&s;t Beginnings ought not to be unattended to by either. I will therefore pur&s;ue my excellent Author without further Apology, &s;ince you have put his Work into my Hands.</P>
<P>The next Thing then, which he pre&s;cribes, is <HI>plain Diet.</HI> This &s;peaks for it&s;elf; for the Baby can
<PB N="319" REF="320">
have no corrupt Ta&s;te to gratify: All is pure, as out of the Hand of Nature; and what is not plain and natural, mu&s;t vitiate and offend.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>no Wine,</HI> or <HI>&s;trong Drink.</HI> Equally just; and for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Little</HI> or <HI>no Phy&s;ick.</HI> Undoubtedly right. For the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of Phy&s;ick, without Nece&s;&s;ity, or by way of <HI>Precaution,</HI> as &s;ome call it, begets the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of Phy&s;ick; and the very <HI>Word</HI> &s;uppo&s;es <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> or <HI>Di&s;order</HI>; and where there is none, would a Parent beget one, or render its &s;alutary Force inef|fectual, by frequent U&s;e, when it was wanted?</P>
<P>Next, he forbids <HI>too warm</HI> and <HI>too &s;treight Cloathing.</HI> Dear Sir, this is ju&s;t as I wi&s;h it. How has my Heart ached, many and many a time, when I have &s;een poor Babies roll'd and &s;wath'd, ten or a dozen times round, then Blanket upon Blanket, Mantle upon that; its little Neck pinn'd down to one Po&s;ture; its Head, more than it frequently needs, triple-crown'd like a young Pope, with Cover|ing upon Covering; its Legs and Arms, as if to prevent that kindly Stretching, which we rather ought to promote, when it is in Health, and is aiming at Growth and Inlargement, the former bundled up, the latter pinn'd down; and how the poor Thing lies on the Nur&s;e's Lap, a mi&s;erable little pinion'd Captive, goggling and staring with its Eyes, the only Organs it has at Liberty, as if it was &s;up|plicating for Freedom to its fetter'd Limbs! Nor has it any Comfort at all, till, with a Sigh or two, like a dying Deer, it drops a&s;leep; and happy then will it be, till the officious Nur&s;e's Care &s;hall awaken it for its unde&s;ired Food, ju&s;t as if the good Woman were re&s;olv'd to try its Con&s;titution, and were willing to &s;ee how many Difficulties it could overcome.</P>
<P>Then this Gentleman advi&s;es, that the Head and Feet &s;hould be kept cold; and the latter often us'd
<PB N="320" REF="321">
to cold Water, and expos'd to Wet, in order to lay the Foundation, as he &s;ays, of an healthy and hardy Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, what a Plea&s;ure is it to your Girl, that her Notions, and her Practice too, fall in &s;o exactly with this learned Gentleman's Advice, that, excepting one Article, which is, that your <HI>Billy</HI> has not yet been accu&s;tom'd to be <HI>wet-&s;hed</HI>; every other Par|ticular has been ob&s;erv'd!&mdash;And don't you &s;ee what a charming, charming Baby he is?&mdash;Nay, and &s;o is your little <HI>Davers,</HI> for his Age&mdash;pretty Soul!</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome, were they to &s;ee this, would not be &s;o ready, as I know you will be, to excu&s;e me; and would be apt to &s;ay, What Nur&s;ery Imperti|nencies are the&s;e, to trouble a Man with!&mdash;But, with all their Wi&s;dom, they would be mi&s;taken; for if a Child has not good Health, (and are not the&s;e Rules, the moral Foundation, as I may &s;ay, of that Ble&s;&s;ing?) its animal Organs will play but poorly in a weak or cra&s;y Ca&s;e. The&s;e, therefore, are nece&s;&s;ary Rules to be ob&s;erved for the fir&s;t two or three Years; for then the little Buds of their Minds will begin to open, and their watchful Mamma will be imploy'd, like a skilful Gardener, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting and encouraging the charming Flower thro' its &s;everal hopeful Stages to Perfection, when it &s;hall become one of the principal Ornaments of that delicate Garden, your honour'd Family. Pardon me, Sir, if in the above Paragraph I am too figurative. I begin to be afraid I am out of my Sphere, writing to your dear Self, on the&s;e important Subjects.</P>
<P>But be that as it may, I will here put an End to this my fir&s;t Letter, (on the earlie&s;t Part of my Subject) rejoicing in the Opportunity you have given me of producing a fre&s;h In&s;tance of that Duty and Affection, wherewith I am, and &s;hall ever be, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>

You can never hope to teach him to ma&s;ter it, whil&s;t you compound for the Check you give his Inclination in one Place, by the Satisfaction you propo&s;e to it in another: To make a good, a wi&s;e, and a virtuous Man, 'tis fit he &s;hould learn to cro&s;s his Appetite, and deny his Inclination to Riches, Finery, or plea&s;ing his Palate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="323">This, Sir, is excellently &s;aid; but is it not a little too philo&s;ophical and ab&s;tracted, not only for the Generality of Children, but for the Age he &s;uppo&s;es them to be of, if one may gue&s;s by the Apples and the Sugar-plums propo&s;ed for the Rewards of their Well-doing? Would not this, Sir, require in Child|ren, that Memory and Reflection, which the &s;ame Author, in another Place, calls the Concomitant of Prudence and Age, and not of Childhood?</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly very right, to check an unrea&s;on|able Appetite, and that at its fir&s;t Appearance. But if &s;o &s;mall and &s;o rea&s;onable an Inducement will prevail, &s;urely, Sir, it might be comply'd with. A generous Mind takes Delight to win over others by good U&s;age and Mildne&s;s, rather than by Severity; and it mu&s;t be a great Pain to &s;uch an one, to be always inculcating, on his Children or Pupils the Doctrine of Self-denial, by Methods quite grievous to his own Nature.</P>
<P>What I would then humbly propo&s;e, is, That the Encouragements offer'd to Youth, &s;hould, indeed, be innocent ones, as the Gentleman injoins, and not &s;uch as would lead to Luxury, either of Food or Appa|rel: But I humbly think it nece&s;&s;ary, that Rewards, <HI>proper</HI> Rewards, &s;hould be propos'd as Incentives to laudable Actions: For is it not by this Method, that the whole World is influenc'd and govern'd? Does not GOD him&s;elf, by Rewards and Puni&s;hments, make it our <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> as well as our <HI>Duty,</HI> to obey HIM? And can we propo&s;e to our&s;elves, for the Government of our Children, a better Example than that of the Almighty?</P>
<P>This fine Author &s;eems, dear Sir, to think he had been a little of the &s;tricte&s;t, and liable to &s;ome Exception. "I &s;ay not this," proceeds he, (&sect; 53.)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that I would have Children kept from the Con|veniencies or Plea&s;ures of Life, that are not inju|rious to their Health or Virtue. On the contrary,
<PB N="323" REF="324">
I would have their Lives made as plea&s;ant and as agreeable to them as may be, in a plentiful Enjoy|ment of what&s;oever might innocently delight them."</Q>
And yet, dear Sir, he immediately &s;ubjoins a very hard and difficult Provi&s;o to the Indulgence he has ju&s;t granted&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Provided," &s;ays he,
"it be with this Caution, That they have tho&s;e Enjoyments only as the Con&s;equences of the State of E&s;teem and Acceptation they are in with their Parents and Governors."</Q></P>
<P>I doubt, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> this is expecting &s;uch a Di&s;tinction and Di&s;cretion in Children, as they are &s;eldom capable of in their tender Years, and requiring &s;uch Capacities as are not commonly to be met with: So that it is not pre&s;cribing to the <HI>Generality,</HI> as this excellent Author intended. 'Tis, I humbly conceive, next to impo&s;&s;ible, that their tender Minds &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h beyond Facts: They covet this or that Plaything, and have no other Motive than being gra|tify'd in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they de&s;ire. The Parent, or Governor, has another Motive in obliging the Child: He takes Advantage of its De&s;ires, and annexes to the Indulgence which the Child hopes for, &s;uch or &s;uch a Task or Duty, as a Condition; and &s;hews him&s;elf pleas'd with its Compliance with it: So the Child wins its Plaything, and receives the Prai&s;e and Commendation &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to lead on young Minds to laudable Pur&s;uits. But, dear Sir, &s;hall it not be &s;uffer'd to enjoy the innocent Reward of its Compliance, unle&s;s it can give Satisfaction, that its greate&s;t Delight is not in having the Thing coveted, but in performing the Task, or obeying the Injunctions, impos'd upon it as a Condition of its being oblig'd? I doubt, Sir, this is a little too &s;trict, and not to be expected from Children. A Servant, full-grown, would not be able to &s;hew one, that, on Condition he comply'd with &s;uch and &s;uch
<PB N="324" REF="325">
Terms, (which, it is to be &s;uppos'd by the <HI>Offer,</HI> he would not have comply'd with, but for that Inducement) that he &s;hould have &s;uch and &s;uch a Reward; I &s;ay, he would hardly be able to &s;hew one, that he preferr'd the Plea&s;ure of performing the requi&s;ite Conditions to the &s;tipulated Reward. How then is it to be expected from a Child, who is le&s;s capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing?</P>
<P>Let therefore, if, Sir, I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay &s;o, innocent Rewards be propos'd, and let us be con|tented to lead on the ductile Minds of Children to a Love of their Duty, by obliging them with &s;uch: We may tell them what we <HI>expect</HI> in this Ca&s;e; but we ought not, I humbly conceive, to be too rigorous in <HI>exacting</HI> it; for, after all, the Inducement will certainly be the uppermo&s;t Con&s;ideration with the Child: 'Tis out of Nature to &s;uppo&s;e it otherwi&s;e; nor had it been offer'd to it, if the Parent him&s;elf had not thought &s;o. And therefore we can only let the Child know his Duty in this re&s;pect, and that he <HI>ought</HI> to give a Preference to that, and then re&s;t our&s;elves contented, altho' we &s;hould di&s;cern, that the Reward is the chief Incentive, if it do but oblige to the Performance of it. For this, from whatever Motive inculcated, may beget a Habit in the Child of doing it; and then, as it improves in Years, one may hope, that Rea&s;on will take place, and enable him, from the mo&s;t &s;olid and durable Motives, to give a Preference to the Duty.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, then, may I, Sir, venture to &s;ay, That we &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t upon it, that the Child &s;hould &s;o nicely di&s;tingui&s;h away its little <HI>innate</HI> Pa&s;|&s;ions, as if we expected it to be born a Philo&s;opher? Self-denial is indeed a mo&s;t excellent Doctrine, to be inculcated in Children, and it mu&s;t be done <HI>early</HI> too: But we mu&s;t not be too &s;evere in our exacting it; for a Duty too rigidly in&s;i&s;ted upon, will make
<PB N="325" REF="326">
it odious. This Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> him&s;elf excellently ob&s;erves in another Place, on the Head of too great Severity; which he illu&s;trates by a familiar Compari&s;on: "Offen&s;ive Circum&s;tances," &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ordinarily infect innocent Things, which they are joined with. And the very Sight of a Cup, wherein any one u&s;es to take nau&s;eous Phy&s;ick, turns his Sto|mach; &s;o that nothing will reli&s;h well out of it, tho' the Cup be never &s;o clean and well-&s;hap'd, and of the riche&s;t Materials."</Q></P>
<P>Permit me, dear Sir, to add, That Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> proceeds to explain him&s;elf &s;till more rigorou&s;ly on the Subject of Rewards; which I quote, to &s;hew I have not mi&s;under&s;tood him. "But the&s;e Enjoy|ments," &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;hould <HI>never</HI> be offer'd or be&s;tow'd on Children, as the Rewards of this or that particular Performance, that they &s;hew an Aver&s;ion to, or to which they would not have apply'd them&s;elves without that Temptation."</Q>
If, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Minds of Children <HI>can</HI> be led on by innocent Inducements to the Performance of a Duty, of which they are capable, what I have humbly offer'd, is enough, I pre&s;ume, to convince one, that it <HI>may</HI> be done. But if ever a particular Study be propos'd to be ma&s;ter'd, or a Byas to be overcome, that is not an <HI>indi&s;pen&s;able</HI> Requi&s;ite to his future Life or Morals, to which the Child &s;hews an Aver&s;ion, I would not, methinks, have him be too much tempted or compell'd to conquer or &s;ub|due it, e&s;pecially if it appear to be a <HI>natural</HI> or rivetted Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>For, Sir, permit me to ob&s;erve, That the Edu|cation and Studies of Children ought, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to be &s;uited to their Capacities and Incli|nations: And, by this means, we may expect to have always <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> and often <HI>great</HI> Men, in different Profe&s;&s;ions: For that Genius, that will not take to
<PB N="326" REF="327">
one Study, may &s;hine in another no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary Part of Science. But, if innocent, the Promi&s;e of innocent, Rewards, will conquer this <HI>Aver&s;ion,</HI> as it is call'd; it will then hardly bear that Name; and let them, by all means, if I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay &s;o, be propos'd for their Encouragement. Neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t repeat, that if, as the Child grows up, and is capable of &s;o much Rea&s;on, that, from the Love of the <HI>Inducement,</HI> one can rai&s;e his Mind to the Love of the <HI>Duty,</HI> it &s;hould be done by all means. But, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I am afraid, that <HI>that</HI> Parent or Tutor will meet but with little Succe&s;s, who, in a Child's <HI>tender</HI> Years, &s;hall refu&s;e to comply with its Foibles, till he &s;ees it values its Duty, and the Plea&s;ure of obeying its Commands, beyond the little Enjoyment on which its Heart is fixed. For, as I humbly conceive, that Mind, which can be brought to prefer its Duty to its Appetites, will want little of the Perfection of the wi&s;e&s;t Philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Sir, permit me to &s;ay, That I am afraid, this perpetual Oppo&s;ition between the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Child, and the Duty to be inforced, e&s;pecially when he &s;ees how other Children are indulg'd, (for if this Regimen could be ob&s;erv'd by <HI>any,</HI> it would be impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould become <HI>general,</HI> while the fond and the incon&s;iderate Parents are &s;o large a Part of Mankind) will cow and di&s;pirit a Child; and will, perhaps, produce a Nece&s;&s;ity of making u&s;e of Severity to &s;ubdue him to this Temper of Self-denial; for if the Child refu&s;es, the Parent <HI>mu&s;t</HI> in&s;i&s;t; and what will be the Con&s;equence? &mdash; Mu&s;t it not introduce a har&s;her Di&s;cipline than this Gen|tleman allows of?&mdash;And which, I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, did never yet do Good to any but to &s;lavi&s;h and ba&s;e Spirits, if to them.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My deare&s;t Mr.</HI> B.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL continue my Subject, altho' I have not had an Opportunity to know whether you approve of my Notions or not, by rea&s;on of the Excur&s;ions you have been pleas'd to allow me to make in your beloved Company, to the Sea-ports of this King|dom, and to the more noted inland Towns of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> which have given me infinite Delight and Plea&s;ure, and inlarg'd my Notions of the Wealth and Power of the Kingdom, in which God's Goodne&s;s has given you &s;o con&s;iderable a Stake.</P>
<P>My next Topick will be upon an Home Educa|tion, which Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> prefers, for &s;everal weighty Rea&s;ons, to a School one, provided &s;uch a Tutor can be procur'd, as he makes next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility to procure. The Gentleman has &s;et forth the Inconve|niencies of both, and was him&s;elf &s;o di&s;courag'd on a Review of them, that he was ready, as he &s;ays, to throw up his Pen. My chief Cares, dear Sir, on this Head, are threefold: 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The Difficulty, which, as I &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> makes almo&s;t in&s;uperable,
<PB N="328" REF="329">
to find a Tutor qualify'd. 2<HI>dly,</HI> The Nece&s;&s;ity there is, according to Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> of keeping the Youth out of the Company of the meaner Servants, who may &s;et him bad Examples. And, next, Tho&s;e &s;till greater Difficulties, which will ari&s;e from the Exam|ples of his Parents, if they are not very di&s;creet and circum&s;pect.</P>
<P>As to the Qualifications of the Tutor, Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, that he is to be &s;o learned, &s;o di&s;creet, &s;o wi&s;e, in &s;hort, &s;o <HI>perfect</HI> a Man, that, I doubt, and &s;o does Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> &s;uch an one is hardly po&s;&s;ible to be met with for this <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>&s;lavi&s;h</HI> Imploy|ment. I pre&s;ume, Sir, to call it &s;o, becau&s;e of the too little Regard that is generally paid to the&s;e u&s;e|ful Men in the Families of the Great, where they are too frequently put upon a Foot with the upper|mo&s;t Servants, and the rather, if they happen to be Men of Mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>"I would," &s;ays this Gentleman,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"from Child|rens fir&s;t beginning to talk, have &s;ome di&s;creet, &s;ober, nay, <HI>wi&s;e</HI> Per&s;on about them, who&s;e Care it &s;hould be to fa&s;hion them right, and to keep them from all Ill; e&s;pecially the Infection of bad Company."</Q>
I think," continues he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this Pro|vince requires great Sobriety, Temperance, Ten|derne&s;s, Diligence, and Di&s;cretion; Qualities hardly to be found united in Per&s;ons that are to be had for ordinary Salaries, nor ea&s;ily to be found any|where."</Q></P>
<P>If this, Sir, be the Ca&s;e, does not this excellent Author recommend a Scheme, that is render'd in a manner impracticable from this Difficulty?</P>
<P>As to the&s;e Qualities being more rarely to be met with in Per&s;ons that are to be had for <HI>ordinary Sala|ries,</HI> I cannot help being of Opinion, (altho', with Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> I think, no Expence &s;hould be &s;pared, if that <HI>would</HI> do) that there is as good a Chance of
<PB N="329" REF="330">
finding &s;uch an one among the needy Scholars, as among tho&s;e better provided for: Becau&s;e the Ne|ce&s;&s;ities of the former, as they became a Spur to his own Learning and Improvement, &s;o will they, at fir&s;t &s;etting out in the World, quicken his Diligence, and, in Hopes of recommending him to a worthier Lot, make him be glad of embracing an Offer of this kind, in a Family, which has Intere&s;t enough to prefer him.</P>
<P>I &s;ay not this, dear Sir, to encourage that wretched Niggardline&s;s, which this Gentleman ju&s;tly cen&s;ures, of tho&s;e who grudge an hand&s;ome Con&s;ideration to &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and painful a Labour as that of a Tutor, which, where a de&s;erving Man can be met with, cannot be too genteelly rewarded, nor him&s;elf too re&s;pectfully treated. I only take the Liberty to deliver my Opinion, that an humble Condition is as likely as any other to produce a Gentleman of the&s;e good Qualities, as well for the Rea&s;on I have hinted at, as for others, which might be mention'd. To which, to name no more, the Merit of Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> will bear Witne&s;s.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> proceeds with his Difficulties in this Particular:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To form a young Gentleman as he &s;hould be,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'tis fit his Governor &s;hould be well-bred, under&s;tand the Ways of Carriage, and Mea&s;ures of Civility, in all the Variety of <HI>Per&s;ons, Times,</HI> and <HI>Places</HI>; and keep his Pupil, as far as his Age requires, con&s;tantly to the Ob&s;ervation of them. This is an Art,"</Q>
con|tinues he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not to be learnt or taught by Books. Nothing can give it, but good Company, and Ob&s;ervation, join'd together."</Q></P>
<P>And in another Place,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Be&s;ides being well-bred, the Tutor &s;hould know the World well; the Ways, the Humours, the Follies, the Cheats, the Faults of the Age he is fallen into, and particularly of
<PB N="330" REF="331">
the Country he lives in: The&s;e he &s;hould be able to &s;hew to his Pupil, as he finds him capable; teach him Skill in Men, and their Manners; pull off the Mask, which their &s;everal Callings and Pretences cover them with; and make his Pupil di&s;cern what lies at the Bottom, under &s;uch Ap|pearances, that he may not, as unexperienc'd young Men are apt to do, if they are unwarn'd, take one thing for another, judge by the Out&s;ides, and give him&s;elf up to Shew, and the In&s;inuation of a fair Carriage, or an obliging Application: Teach him to gue&s;s at, and beware of, the De|&s;igns of Men he hath to do with, neither with too much Su&s;picion, nor too much Confidence."</Q></P>
<P>This, dear Sir, is excellently &s;aid: 'Tis noble <HI>Theory.</HI> And if the Tutor is a Man void of Re|&s;entment and Caprice, and will not be govern'd by partial Con&s;iderations in his own Judgment of Per|&s;ons and Things, it will be well: But if otherwi&s;e, he may take Advantage of the Confidence plac'd in him, to the Injury of &s;ome worthy Per&s;on, and by Degrees monopolize the young Gentleman to him|&s;elf, and govern his Pa&s;&s;ions as ab&s;olutely, as I have heard &s;ome Fir&s;t Mini&s;ters have done tho&s;e of their Prince, equally to his own per&s;onal Di&s;reputation, and to the Di&s;advantage of his People. But,</P>
<P>All this, and much more, according to Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> is the Duty of a Tutor; and on the finding out &s;uch an one, depends his Scheme of an Home Educa|tion. No Wonder then, that he him&s;elf &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When I con&s;ider the Scruples and Cautions, I here lay in your Way, methinks it looks as if I advi&s;ed you to &s;omething, which I would have offer'd at, but in Effect not done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Permit me, dear Sir, in this Place, to expre&s;s my Fear, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible for any one, of Talents inferior to tho&s;e of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> him&s;elf, to come up to the
<PB N="331" REF="332">
Rules he has laid down on this Subject; and 'tis to be que&s;tion'd, whether even <HI>he,</HI> with all that va&s;t Stock of natural Rea&s;on, and &s;olid Sen&s;e, for which, as you tell me, Sir, he was &s;o famous, had attain'd to the&s;e Perfections, at his fir&s;t &s;etting out into Life.</P>
<P>Now, therefore, dear Sir, you can't imagine, how the&s;e Difficulties perplex me, as to my knowing how to judge which is be&s;t, an Home or a School Education!&mdash; For hear what this excellent Author &s;o ju&s;tly ob&s;erves on the latter, among other things no le&s;s to the Purpo&s;e:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;ure, he who is able to be at the Charge of a Tutor at Home, may there give his Son a more genteel Carriage, more manly Thoughts, and a Sen&s;e of what is worthy and becoming, with a greater Proficiency in Learning into the Bargain, and ripen him up &s;ooner into a Man, than any at School can do. Not that I blame the School-ma&s;ter, in this,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"or think it to be laid to his Charge. The Differ|ence is great between two or three Pupils in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, and three or four&s;core Boys lodg'd up and down: For, let the Ma&s;ter's Indu&s;try and Skill be never &s;o great, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have 50 or 100 Scholars under his Eye, any longer than they are in the School together."</Q>
But then, Sir, if there be &s;uch a Difficulty, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;ays, to meet with a proper Tutor, what a perplexing thing is this? And what &s;hall one &s;ay, as to the Preference he gives to an Home Education, in which &s;uch a Tutor is to be &s;uppos'd nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>But then, according to this Gentleman, there is another Difficulty attending an Home Education; and is, what I hinted at before, in my &s;econd Article, The Nece&s;&s;ity there is to keep the Youth out of the Company of the meaner Servants, who may &s;et him bad Examples. For thus he &s;ays:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here is another great Inconvenience, which Children
<PB N="332" REF="333">
receive from the ill Examples, which they meet with from the meaner Servants. They are <HI>wholly,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, to be kept from &s;uch Conver&s;ation: For the Contagion of the&s;e ill Precedents, both in Civility and Virtue, horribly infects Children, as often as they come within Reach of it. They frequently learn from unbred or debauched Ser|vants, &s;uch Language, untowardly Tricks, and Vices, as otherwi&s;e they would be ignorant of, all their Lives. 'Tis an hard Matter wholly to prevent this Mi&s;chief,"</Q> continues he; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you will have very good Luck, if you never have a clowni&s;h or vicious Servant, and if from them your Child|ren never get any Infection."</Q></P>
<P>Then, Sir, my next Point (which I mention'd in the Beginning of this Letter) is a &s;till greater Dif|ficulty, as it may happen in an Home Education; to wit, The Example of the Parents them&s;elves, if they be not very circum&s;pect and di&s;creet.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Difficulties in an Home Education be|ing put together, let me, dear Sir, humbly propo&s;e it, as a Matter for your Con&s;ideration and Deter|mination, Whether there be not a middle way to be found out in a School Education, that may re|medy &s;ome of the&s;e Inconveniencies? For &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you cannot, as the Task is &s;o difficult, get a Tutor &s;o qualified, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> thinks he ought to be, for your <HI>Billy,</HI> as he grows up. Suppo&s;e there is Danger from your meaner Servants; and &s;uppo&s;e we his Parents &s;hould not be able to lay our&s;elves under the requi&s;ite Re&s;traints, in order to form his Mind by our own Examples, which, I hope, by GOD's Grace, however, will not be the Ca&s;e&mdash; Cannot &s;ome Ma&s;ter be found out, who &s;hall be &s;o well rewarded for his Care of a <HI>few</HI> young Gentlemen, as &s;hall make it worth his while to be contented with tho&s;e <HI>few?</HI> &s;uppo&s;e Five, Six, Seven,
<PB N="333" REF="334">
or Eight at mo&s;t; who&s;e Morals and Breeding he may attend to, as well as to their Learning? The farther this Ma&s;ter lives from the young Gentlemens Friends, the better it may be. We will hope, that he is a Man of a mild Di&s;po&s;ition, but &s;trict in his Di&s;cipline, and who &s;hall make it a Rule not to give Correction for &s;mall Faults, or till every other Method has been try'd; who carries &s;uch a ju&s;t Dignity in his Manner, without the Appearance of Tyranny, that his Looks may be of greater Force, than the Words of &s;ome, and his Words than the Blows of others; and who will rather endeavour to &s;hame than terrify a Youth out of his Faults. Then, Sir, &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an one was to allot &s;uch a Portion of Time for the <HI>more learned</HI> Studies; and before the Youth was tir'd with <HI>them,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an|other Portion was allotted for the <HI>Writing</HI> and <HI>Arith|metick</HI> Parts; and then, to relieve his Mind from both, &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Dancing-ma&s;ter</HI> &s;hould take his Part; and innocent Exerci&s;es of mere Diver&s;ion, to fill up the re&s;t, at his own Choice, in which, di|verted by &s;uch a Rotation of Imployments, (all thus render'd delightful by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Variety) he would hardly wi&s;h to pa&s;s much Time. For the Dancing of it&s;elf will an&s;wer both Parts, that of good Breeding, and that of Exerci&s;e: And thus dif|ferent Studies, at one time, may be ma&s;ter'd.</P>
<P>Moreover the Emulation, which will be in&s;pir'd, where there are &s;everal young Gentlemen, will be of inconceivable U&s;e both to Tutor and Pupil, in le&s;&s;ening the Trouble of the one, and advancing the Learning of the other, which cannot be expected, where there is but a &s;ingle young Gentleman to take care of.</P>
<P>Such a Ma&s;ter will know it to be his Intere&s;t, as well as his Duty, to have a watchful Eye over the Conduct and Behaviour of his Servants. His A&s;|&s;i&s;tants,

in the different Branches of Science and Education, will be Per&s;ons of approved Prudence, for whom he will think him&s;elf an&s;werable, &s;ince his own <HI>Reputation</HI> will depend upon their Beha|viour, as well as his <HI>Livelihood.</HI> The young Gentle|men will have young Gentlemen for their Com|panions, all under the Influence of the &s;ame Pre|cepts and Directions; and if &s;ome cho&s;en Period were fixed, once a Week, as a Reward for &s;ome Excellence, where, at a little Desk, rais'd a Step or two above the other Seats, the excelling Youth &s;hould be &s;et to read, under the Ma&s;ter's Direction, a little Portion from the be&s;t Tran&s;lations of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians, and even from the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Authors; this might, in a very engaging manner, initiate them into the Knowlege of the Hi&s;tory of pa&s;t Times, and of their own Country, and give them a Curio&s;ity to pa&s;s &s;ome of their vacant Hours in the &s;ame laudable Pur&s;uit: For, dear Sir, I mu&s;t &s;till in&s;i&s;t, that Rewards, and inno|cent Gratifications, as al&s;o little Honours and Di&s;tin|ctions, mu&s;t needs be very attractive to the Minds of Youth.</P>

<L>Our Appetites are apt to change, as theirs,</L>
<L>And full as craving too, and full as vain.</L></Q></P>
<P>Permit me, Sir, to tran&s;cribe four or five Lines more, for the Beauty of the Thought:
<Q><L>And yet the Soul, &s;hut up in her dark Room,</L>
<L>Viewing &s;o clear <HI>abroad,</HI> at <HI>home</HI> &s;ees nothing:</L>
<L>But like a Mole in Earth, bu&s;y and blind,</L>
<L>Works all her Folly up, and ca&s;ts it outward</L>
<L>To the World's open View&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Improving the Thought; methinks, I can &s;ee the dear little Mi&s;s, who has, in &s;ome eminent Task, borne away the Palm, making her publick Entry, as I may call it, after her Dairy Breakfa&s;t, and pretty Airing, into her Governe&s;s's Court-yard, through a Row of her School-fellows, drawn out on each Side, to admire her; her Governe&s;s and A&s;&s;i&s;tants receiving her at the Porch, their little Capitol, and lifting her out with Applau&s;es and Encomiums, with a <HI>Thus &s;hall it be done to the Mi&s;s, whom her Go|verne&s;s delighteth to honour!</HI> I &s;ee not, my Mr. <HI>B.</HI> why the dear Mi&s;s, in this Ca&s;e, as &s;he moves thro' her admiring School-fellows, may not have her little Heart beat with as much Delight, be as gloriou&s;ly elated, proportionally, as that of the greate&s;t Hero in his Triumphal Car, who has return'd from Ex|ploits, perhaps, much le&s;s laudable.</P>
<P>But how I ramble!&mdash; Yet, &s;urely, Sir, you don't expect Method or Connexion from your Girl. The Education of our Sex will not permit that, where it is be&s;t. We are forced to &s;truggle for Knowlege,
<PB N="336" REF="337">
like the poor feeble Infant, in the Month, who, as I de&s;crib'd in my fir&s;t Letter on this Subject, is pinn'd and fetter'd down upon the Nur&s;e's Lap; and who, if its little Arms happen, by Chance, to e&s;cape its Nur&s;e's Ob&s;ervation, and offer but to expand them&s;elves, are immediately taken into Cu&s;tody, and pinion'd down to their pa&s;&s;ive Behaviour. So, when a poor Girl, in &s;pite of her narrow Education, breaks out into Notice, her Genius is immediately tamed by trifling Imployments, le&s;t perhaps &s;he &s;hould become the Envy of one Sex, and the Equal of the other.

<P>WELL, but, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> you will, perhaps, think from my la&s;t rambling Letter, that I am mo&s;t inclin'd to a <HI>School</HI> Education for your <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;ome Years hence, if it &s;hall plea&s;e GOD to &s;pare him to us. But indeed I cannot &s;ay, that I am: I only lay &s;everal things together in my u&s;ual indige&s;ted and roving way, to take your Opinion upon, which, as it ought, will be always deci&s;ive
<PB N="337" REF="338">
with me. And indeed I am &s;o throughly convinc'd by Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Rea&s;ons, where the Behaviour of Servants can be &s;o well an&s;wer'd for, as that of yours can be, where the Example of the Parents will be, as I hope, rather edifying than otherwi&s;e, that, without being &s;way'd, as I think, by maternal Fondne&s;s, in this Ca&s;e, I mu&s;t needs give a Prefer|ence to the Home Education; and the little Scheme I pre&s;um'd to form in my la&s;t, was only, as you will be pleas'd to remember, on a Suppo&s;ition, that tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Points could not be &s;o well &s;ecur'd.</P>
<P>In my Ob&s;ervations on this Head, I &s;hall take the Liberty, Sir, in one or two Particulars, a little to differ from an Author, that I admire exceedingly; and that is the pre&s;ent De&s;ign of my writing the&s;e Letters; for I &s;hall hereafter, if God &s;pare my Life, in my little Book, (when you have kindly decided upon the Points in which I pre&s;ume to differ from that Gentleman) &s;hew you, Sir, my great Reverence and E&s;teem for him; and &s;hall then be able to let you know all my Sentiments on this important Sub|ject, and that more undoubtingly, as I &s;hall be more improv'd by Years, and your dear Conver&s;ation; e&s;pecially, Sir, if I have the Honour and Happine&s;s of a foreign Tour with you, of which you give me Hope; &s;o much are you pleas'd with the Delight I take in the&s;e improving Excur&s;ions, which you have now favour'd me with, at times, thro' more than half the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Well then, Sir, I will proceed to con&s;ider a little more particularly the Subject of an Home Educa|tion, with an Eye to tho&s;e Difficulties, which Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> takes notice of, as I have mention'd in my la&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, the Difficulty of finding a qualify'd Tutor; we mu&s;t not expect &s;o much Perfection, I doubt, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> lays down as nece&s;&s;ary. What, therefore, I humbly conceive is be&s;t to be done,
<PB N="338" REF="339">
will be to avoid chu&s;ing a Man of bigotted and nar|row Principles, who yet &s;hall not be tainted with &s;ceptical or heterodox Notions; who &s;hall not be a mere Scholar or Pedant; who has travell'd, and yet pre&s;erv'd his moral Character untainted; and who&s;e Behaviour and Carriage is ea&s;y, unaffected, un|formal, and genteel, as well acquiredly as naturally &s;o, if po&s;&s;ible; who &s;hall not be dogmatical, po&s;i|tive, overbearing, on one hand; nor too yielding, &s;uppliant, fawning, on the other; who &s;hall &s;tudy the Child's natural Bent, in order to direct his Stu|dies to the Point, in which he is mo&s;t likely to ex|cel. In order to pre&s;erve the Re&s;pect due to his own Character from every one, he mu&s;t not be a Bu&s;y-body in the Family, a Whi&s;perer, a Tale-bearer; but be a Per&s;on of a benevolent Turn of Mind, ready to compo&s;e Differences: who &s;hall avoid, of all things, that Foppi&s;hne&s;s of Dre&s;s and Appearance, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Petits-ma&icirc;tres, and <HI>French</HI> U&s;hers, (that I have &s;een at &s;ome Boarding-&s;chools) for Coxcombs, rather than Guides of Education: For, as I have heard you, my be&s;t Tutor, often ob&s;erve, the Peculiarities of Habit, where a Per&s;on aims at &s;ome|thing fanta&s;tick, or out of Character, are an un|doubted Sign of a wrong Head: For &s;uch an one is &s;o kind, as always to hang out on his Sign, what &s;ort of Furniture he has in his Shop, to &s;ave you the Trouble of a&s;king Que&s;tions about him; &s;o that one may know what he <HI>is,</HI> as much as one can know a Widow by her Weeds.</P>
<P>Such a Per&s;on as I have thus negatively de&s;crib'd, may be found without very much Difficulty perhaps, becau&s;e &s;ome of the&s;e Requi&s;ites are per&s;onal, and others are &s;uch as are obvious, at fir&s;t Sight, to a common Penetration; or, where not &s;o, may be found out by Inquiry into his general Character
<PB N="339" REF="340">
and Behaviour: And to the Care of &s;uch an one, dear Sir, let me for the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;e your <HI>Billy</HI> is committed: And &s;o we acquit our&s;elves of the fir&s;t Difficulty, as well as we can, that of the Tu|tor; who, to make him&s;elf more perfect, may form him&s;elf, as to what he wants, by Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s ex|cellent Rules on that Head.</P>
<P>But before I quit this Subject, will you give me Leave, Sir, to remind you of your own Opinion upon it, in a Conver&s;ation that pa&s;s'd between you and Sir <HI>George Stuart,</HI> and his Nephew, in <HI>London</HI>; in which you &s;eem'd to prefer a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Gentleman for a Tutor, to tho&s;e of your own Nation, and &s;till more than to tho&s;e of <HI>France.</HI> Don't you remember it, dear Sir? And how much tho&s;e Gentlemen were pleas'd with your facetious Freedom with their Country, and &s;aid, You made them Amends for that, in the Preference you gave to their learned and travell'd Youth? If you have forgot it, I will here tran&s;cribe it from my <HI>Records,</HI> as I call my Book of Memorandums; for every time I am pleas'd with a Conver&s;ation, and have Lei&s;ure, before it goes out of my Memory, I enter it down as near the very Words as I can; and now you have made me your Corre&s;pondent, I &s;hall &s;ometimes perhaps give you back &s;ome Valuables from your own Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Turner,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fan|&s;haw,</HI> were pre&s;ent, I well remember. The&s;e are your Words, as I have them written down:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Since the Union of the Two Kingdoms, we have many Per&s;ons of Condition, who have taken Tutors for their Sons from <HI>Scotland</HI>; which Practice, to &s;peak impartially, has been attended with &s;ome advantageous Circum&s;tances, that &s;hould not be overlook'd. For, Sir <HI>George,</HI> it
<PB N="340" REF="341">
mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that notwith&s;tanding your narrow and &s;tiff manner of Education in <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Spirit of manly Learning, a kind of poetick Liberty, as I may call it, has begun to exert it|&s;elf in that Part of the I&s;land. The blu&s;tering North, forgive me Gentlemen, &s;eems to have harden'd the Foreheads of her hungry Sons; and the Keenne&s;s with which they &s;et out for Prefer|ment in the kindlier South, has taught them to know a good deal of the World betimes. Thro' the ea&s;y Terms on which Learning is generally attain'd there, as it is earlier inculcated, &s;o it may, probably, take deeper Root: And &s;ince 'tis hardly po&s;&s;ible, forgive me, dear Sir <HI>George,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Stuart,</HI> they can go to a wor&s;e Coun|try on this Side <HI>Greenland,</HI> than &s;ome of the Northern Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI>; &s;o their Education, with a View to travel, and to better them&s;elves by Settlements in other Countries, may perhaps be &s;o many Rea&s;ons for them to take greater Pains to qualify them&s;elves for this Imployment, and may make them &s;ucceed better in it; e&s;pe|cially when they have been able to &s;hake off the Fetters which are rivetted upon them under the narrow Influences of a too tyrannical Kirk-di&s;ci|pline, which you, Sir <HI>George,</HI> have ju&s;t now &s;o freely cen&s;ur'd.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER LV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Deare&s;t Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Now re&s;ume my Subject. I had gone thro' the Article of the Tutor, as well as I could; and now let me trouble you with a few Lines upon what Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;ays, That Children are wholly, if po&s;|&s;ible, to be kept from the Conver&s;ation of the meaner Servants; whom he &s;uppo&s;es to be, as too frequently they are, <HI>unbred and debauch'd,</HI> to u&s;e his own Words.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, let me ob&s;erve, on this Head, that I think it is very difficult to keep Children from the Conver&s;ation of Servants at all times. The Care of per&s;onal Attendance, e&s;pecially in the Child's early Age, mu&s;t fall upon Servants of one Denomi|nation or other, who, little or much, mu&s;t be con|ver&s;ant with the inferior Servants, and &s;o be liable
<PB N="344" REF="345">
to be tainted by their Conver&s;ation; and it will be difficult in this Ca&s;e to prevent the Taint being com|municated to the Child. Wherefore it will be a <HI>&s;urer,</HI> as well as a more <HI>laudable</HI> Method, to in&s;i&s;t upon the regular Behaviour of the whole Family, than to expect the Child, and its immediate Attend|ant or Tutor, &s;hould be the only good ones in it.</P>
<P>Nor is this &s;o difficult a thing to bring about, as may be imagin'd. Your Family, dear Sir, affords an eminent In&s;tance of it: The Good have been con|firm'd, the Remi&s;s have been reform'd, the Pa&s;&s;ion|ate have been tam'd; and there is not a Family in the Kingdom, I will venture to &s;ay, to the Honour of every Individual of it, more uniform, more regu|lar, and freer from Evil, and more regardful of what they &s;ay and do, than yours. And, I believe, Sir, you will allow, that tho' they were always ho|ne&s;t, yet they were not always &s;o laudably, &s;o ex|emplarily virtuous, as of late: Which I mention only to &s;hew the Practicablene&s;s of a Reformation, even where bad Habits have taken place&mdash;For your <HI>Pamela,</HI> Sir, arrogates not to her&s;elf the Honour of this Change: 'Tis owing to the Divine Grace &s;hining upon Hearts naturally good; for el&s;e an Ex|ample &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o plain, &s;o &s;imple, from &s;o young a Mi&s;tre&s;s, who, moreover, had been exalted from their own Station, could not have been attended with &s;uch happy Effects.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, dear Sir, what a Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s's Example could do, with a poor Soul &s;o far gone as Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI> And I dare be confident, that if, on the Hiring of a new Servant, Sobriety of Man|ners, and a virtuous Conver&s;ation, were in&s;i&s;ted up|on; and they were told, that a general Inoffen&s;ive|ne&s;s in Words, as well as Actions, was expected from them, as indi&s;pen&s;able Conditions of their Ser|vice;
<PB N="345" REF="346">
and that a Breach of that kind would be no more pa&s;s'd over, than a wilful Fraud, or Act of Di&s;hone&s;ty; and if, added to the&s;e Requi&s;ites, their Principals take care to &s;upport the&s;e Injunctions by their own Example; I &s;ay, in this Ca&s;e, I dare be confident, that if &s;uch a Service did not <HI>find</HI> them good, it would <HI>make</HI> them &s;o.</P>
<P>And why, indeed, &s;hould we not think this a very practicable Scheme, when it is con&s;ider'd, that the Servants we take, are at Years of Di&s;cretion, and have the &s;trong Tie of <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> &s;uperadded to the Obligations we require of them; and which, they mu&s;t needs know (let 'em have what bad Habits they will) are right for <HI>them&s;elves</HI> to di&s;charge, as well as for <HI>us</HI> to exact?</P>
<P>We all know of how much Force the Example of Superiors is to Inferiors. It is generally and too ju&s;tly &s;aid, That the Courts of Princes abound with the mo&s;t profligate of Men, in&s;omuch that you can|not well give a Man a more &s;ignificantly bad Title, than by calling him a COURTIER: Yet even among the&s;e, one &s;hall &s;ee the Force of <HI>Example,</HI> as I have heard you, Sir, frequently ob&s;erve: For let but the Land be ble&s;t with a pious and religious Prince, who makes it a Rule with him to counte|nance and promote none but Men of Virtue and Probity; and, to put the Ca&s;e &s;till &s;tronger, let &s;uch an one even &s;ucceed to the mo&s;t libertine Reign, wherein the Manners of the People have &s;eem'd to be wholly deprav'd; yet a wonderful Change will be immediately effected.

<P><PB N="346" REF="347">There was a Time, the Reign of King <HI>Richard</HI> III. when, as I have read, Deformity of Body was the Fa&s;hion, and the Nobility and Gentry of the Court thought it an indi&s;pen&s;able Requi&s;ite of a graceful Form to pad for them&s;elves a round Shoulder, be|cau&s;e the King was crooked. And can we think human Nature &s;o ab&s;urdly wicked, that it would not much rather have try'd to imitate a per&s;onal Perfection, than a Deformity &s;o &s;hocking in its Ap|pearance, in People who were naturally &s;trait?</P>
<P>'Tis a melancholy thing to reflect, that of all Pro|fe&s;&s;ions of Men, the Mariners, who mo&s;t behold the Wonders of Almighty Power di&s;play'd in the great Deep, (a Sight that has &s;truck me with Awe and Reverence only from a Coa&s;t Pro&s;pect) and who every Moment of their Lives, while at Sea, have but one frail Plank betwixt them&s;elves and inevitable De&s;truction; are yet, generally &s;peaking, as I have often heard it ob&s;erv'd, the mo&s;t abandon'd In|vokers and Bla&s;phemers of the Name of that GOD, who&s;e Mercies they every Moment unthankfully, altho' &s;o vi&s;ibly, experience. Yet, as I heard it once remark'd at your Table, Sir, on a particular Occa&s;ion, we have now living one Commander in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Navy, who, to his Honour, has &s;hewn the Force of an excellent Example &s;upporting the be&s;t Precepts: For on board of his Ship not an Oath or Cur&s;e was to be heard; while Volleys of both (i&s;&s;ued from im|pious Mouths in the &s;ame Squadron out of his Knowlege) &s;eem'd to fill the Sails of other Ships with guilty Breath, calling aloud for that Perdition to overtake them, which perhaps his worthy In|junctions might be of Weight to &s;u&s;pend.</P>
<P>If &s;uch then, dear Sir, be the Force of a good Example, what have Parents to do, who are di&s;|pos'd to bring up a Child at home under their own

Eye, according to Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Advice, but, fir&s;t, to have a &s;trict Regard to <HI>their own</HI> Conduct? This will not want its due Influence on the Ser|vants; e&s;pecially if a proper Care and Scrutiny be made into their Characters, before they are enter|tain'd, and a watchful Eye be had over them, to keep them up to tho&s;e Characters afterwards. And when they know they mu&s;t forfeit the Favour of a worthy Ma&s;ter, and their Places too, (which may be thought to be the be&s;t of Places, becau&s;e an <HI>uni|form</HI> Character mu&s;t make all around it ea&s;y and happy) they will readily ob&s;erve &s;uch Rules and Di|rections as &s;hall be pre&s;crib'd to them&mdash;Rules and Directions, which their own Con&s;ciences will tell them are <HI>right</HI> to be pre&s;crib'd; and even <HI>right</HI> for them to follow, were they <HI>not</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon by their Superiors: And this Conviction mu&s;t go a great way towards their <HI>thorough</HI> Reformation: For a Per&s;on wholly convinc'd, is half reform'd. And thus the Hazard a Child will run of being corrupted by con|ver&s;ing with the Servants, will be remov'd, and all Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s other Rules be better inforc'd.</P>
<P>I have the Boldne&s;s, Sir, to make another Obje|ction; and that is, to the Di&s;tance which Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> pre&s;cribes to be kept between Children and Servants: For may not this be a Means to fill the Minds of the former with a Contempt of tho&s;e below them, and an Arrogance that is not warranted by any Rank or Condition, to their Inferiors of the &s;ame Species?</P>
<P>I have tran&s;crib'd, Sir <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See p.</HI> 331, 332.</NOTE>, what Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has injoin'd in relation to this Di&s;tance, where he &s;ays, That the Children are by all means to be kept <HI>wholly</HI> from the Conver&s;ation of the meaner Ser|vants.&mdash;But how much better Advice does the &s;ame
<PB N="348" REF="349">

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Another way," &s;ays he, [&sect; 111.) "to in&s;til Sentiments of Humanity, and to keep them lively in young Folks, will be, to accu&s;tom them to Civility in their Language and Deportment to|wards their Inferiors, and the meaner &s;ort of People, particularly Servants. It is not unu&s;ual to ob&s;erve the Children in Gentlemens Families treat the Servants of the Hou&s;e with domineering Words, Names of Contempt, and an imperious Carriage, as if they were of another Race and Species beneath them. Whether ill Example, the Advantage of Fortune, or their natural Va|nity, in&s;pire this Haughtine&s;s, it &s;hould be pre|vented or weeded out; and a gentle, courteous, affable Carriage towards the lower Ranks of Men, plac'd in the Room of it. No Part of their Superiority,"</Q>
continues this excellent Au|thor,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"will be hereby lo&s;t, but the Di&s;tinction in|creas'd, and their Authority &s;trengthen'd, when Love in Inferiors is join'd to outward Re&s;pect, and an E&s;teem of the Per&s;on has a Share in their Submi&s;&s;ion: And Dome&s;ticks will pay a more ready and chearful Service, when they find them|&s;elves not &s;purn'd, becau&s;e Fortune has laid them below the Level of others at their Ma&s;ter's Feet."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e, dear Sir, are certainly the Sentiments of a generous and inlarg'd Spirit: But I hope I &s;hall be forgiven, if I ob&s;erve, that the great Di&s;tance Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> before injoins to be kept between Chil|dren and Servants, is not very con&s;i&s;tent with the
<PB N="349" REF="350">
above-cited: For if we would prevent this undue Contempt of Inferiors in the Temper of Children, the be&s;t way, as I humbly pre&s;ume to think, is not to make it &s;o unpardonable a Fault for them, e&s;pe|cially in their early Years, to be in their Company. For can one make the Children &s;hun the Servants, without rendering them odious or contemptible to them, and repre&s;enting them to the Child in &s;uch di&s;advantageous Lights, as mu&s;t needs make the Servants vile in their Eyes, and them&s;elves lofty and exalted in their own? and thereby cau&s;e them to treat them with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"domineering-Words, and an impe|rious Carriage, as if they were of another Race or Species beneath them; and &s;o,"</Q>
as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"nur&s;e up their natural Pride into an habi|tual Contempt of tho&s;e beneath them: And then,"</Q>
as he adds,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"where will that probably end, but in Oppre&s;&s;ion and Cruelty?"</Q>
&mdash;But this Matter, dear Sir, as I pre&s;ume to think, will all be happily accommodated and reconcil'd, when the Servants good Behaviour is &s;ecur'd by the Ex|ample and Injunctions of the Principals.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, then, of what Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> has injoin'd, and what I have taken the Liberty to &s;ug|ge&s;t on this Head, it &s;hall be my Endeavour, in that early Part of your dear <HI>Billy</HI>'s Education, which your Goodne&s;s will intru&s;t to me, to incul|cate betimes in his Mind the Principles of univer&s;al Benevolence and Kindne&s;s to others, e&s;pecially to Inferiors.</P>
<P>Nor, dear Sir, &s;hall I fear, that the little Dear will be wanting to him&s;elf in a&s;&s;uming, as he grows up, an Air of Superiority and Di&s;tance of Behaviour equal to his Condition, or that he will de&s;cend too low for his Station. For, Sir, there is a Pride and Self-love natural to human Minds, that will &s;eldom
<PB N="350" REF="351">
be kept &s;o low, as to make them humbler than they ought to be.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erv'd, before now, In&s;tances of this, in &s;ome of the Families we vi&s;it, between the young Ma&s;ters or Mi&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e Children of lower De|gree, who have been brought to play with them, or divert them. On the Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;&s;es Side, I have always &s;een, they lead the Play, and pre|&s;cribe the Laws of it, be the Diver&s;ion what it will; while, on the other hand, their lower-rank Play|fellows have generally given into their little Humours, tho' ever &s;o contrary to their own; and the Differ|ence of Dre&s;s and Appearance, and the Notion they have of the more eminent Condition of their Play-fellows Parents, have begot in them a kind of Awe and Re&s;pect, that perhaps more than &s;uffi|ciently &s;ecures the Superiority of the one, and the Subordination of the other.</P>
<P>The Advantage of this univer&s;al Benevolence to a young Gentleman, as he grows up, will be, as I humbly conceive, that it will &s;o diffu&s;e it&s;elf over his Mind, as to influence all his Actions, and give a Grace to every thing he does or &s;ays, and make him admir'd and re&s;pected from the be&s;t and mo&s;t durable Motives; and will be of greater Advantage to him for his attaining an hand&s;ome Addre&s;s and Be|haviour, (for it will make him con&s;cious, that he <HI>merits</HI> the Di&s;tinction he will meet with, and en|courage him &s;till <HI>more</HI> to merit it) than the be&s;t Rules that can be given him for that Purpo&s;e</P>
<P>I will therefore teach the little Dear Courteou&s;|ne&s;s and Affability, from the propere&s;t Motives I am able to think of; and will in&s;truct him in only one Piece of Pride, That of being above doing a mean or low Action. I will caution him not to behave in a lordly or in&s;olent manner, even to the
<PB N="351" REF="352">
lowe&s;t Servants. I will tell him, as I do my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> That that Superiority is the mo&s;t commendable, and will be be&s;t maintain'd, that is owing to Humanity and Kindne&s;s, and which is grounded on the Perfections of the <HI>Mind,</HI> rather than on the <HI>accidental</HI> Advantages of <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Condition</HI>: That if his Conduct be &s;uch as it ought to be, there will be no Occa&s;ion to tell a Servant, that he <HI>will</HI> be ob&s;erv'd and re&s;pected: That <HI>Hu|mility,</HI> as I once told my Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See p.</HI> 296. <HI>l.</HI> 35.</NOTE>, is a charming Grace, and mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly charming in Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction; for that the Poor, who are humbled by their Condition, cannot glory in it, as the Rich may; and that it makes the lower Ranks of People love and admire the High-born, who can &s;o conde&s;cend: Whereas <HI>Pride,</HI> in &s;uch, is Mean|ne&s;s and In&s;ult, as it owes its Boa&s;t and its Being to accidental Advantages; which, at the &s;ame time, are &s;eldom of <HI>his</HI> procuring, who can be &s;o mean as to be proud: That even I would &s;ooner forgive Pride in a low Degree, than in an high; for it may be a Security in the fir&s;t, again&s;t doing a ba&s;e thing: But in the Rich, it is a ba&s;e thing it&s;elf, and an impolitick one too; for the more Di&s;tinction a proud Mind gra&s;ps at, the le&s;s it will have; and every poor de|&s;pis'd Per&s;on can whi&s;per &s;uch an one in the Ear, when &s;urrounded with, and adorn'd by, all his glittering Splendors, that he <HI>was</HI> born, and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> die, in the <HI>&s;ame manner</HI> with tho&s;e whom he de&s;pi&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus will the Doctrine of Benevolence and Affa|bility, inculcated early in the Mind of Youth, and duly cultivated, as he grows up, in&s;pire the young Gentleman with the requi&s;ite Conduct to command
<PB N="352" REF="353">
Re&s;pect from <HI>proper</HI> Motives; and at the &s;ame time that it will make the Servants ob&s;erve a Deco|rum towards him, it will oblige them to have a Guard upon their Words and Actions in the Pre|&s;ence of one, who&s;e Manner of Education and Training-up would be &s;o great a Reproach to them, if they were gro&s;ly faulty: So that hereby, as I con|ceive, a mutual Benefit would flow to the Manners of each, and <HI>his</HI> good Behaviour would render him, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an in&s;tructive Monitor to the whole Family.</P>
<P>But permit me, Sir, to inlarge on the Hint I have already given, in relation to the Example of the Parents, in ca&s;e a Preference be given to the Home Education. For if this Point cannot be &s;e|cur'd, I &s;hould always imagine it were be&s;t to put the Child to &s;uch a School, as I have taken the Li|berty to mention <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>332.</HI></NOTE>. But yet the Subject, Sir, might be &s;par'd by me in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, as I write with a View only to your Family; tho' you will remember, that while I follow Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> who&s;e Work is publick, I mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd as if I was directing my&s;elf to the Generality of the World: For, Sir, I have the Plea&s;ure to &s;ay, That your Conduct in your Family is unexception|able; and the Pride to think, that mine is no Di&s;|grace to it. No one hears a Word from your Mouth unbecoming the Character of a polite Gen|tleman; and I &s;hall always endeavour to be very regardful of what falls from mine. Your Temper, Sir, is equal and kind to all your Servants, and they love you, as well as awefully re&s;pect you: And well does your Genero&s;ity, and bountiful and con&s;iderate Mind, de&s;erve it of them all&punc; And they, &s;eeing I am
<PB N="353" REF="354">
watchful over my own Conduct, &s;o as not to be|have unworthy of your kind Example, regard me as much as I could wi&s;h they &s;hould; for well do they know, that their beloved Ma&s;ter will have it &s;o, and greatly honours and e&s;teems me him&s;elf.&mdash; Your Table-talk is &s;uch as Per&s;ons of the &s;tricte&s;t Principles may hear, and join in: Your Gue&s;ts, and your Friends, are, generally &s;peaking, Per&s;ons of the genteele&s;t Life, and of the be&s;t Manners:&mdash; So that Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> would have advis'd <HI>you,</HI> of all Gentlemen, had he been living, and known you, to give your Children an Home Education, and a&s;&s;ign'd the&s;e, and &s;till &s;tronger Rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>But, dear Sir, were we to &s;peak to the Gene|rality, it is to be fear'd, this would be an almo&s;t in|&s;uperable Objection to it. For (I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, but) when one turns one's Eyes to the bad Pre|cedents given by the Heads of &s;ome Families, it is hardly to be wonder'd at, that there is &s;o little Vir|tue and Religion among Men. For can tho&s;e Pa|rents be &s;urpris'd at the Ungraciou&s;ne&s;s of their <HI>Children,</HI> who hardly ever &s;hew them, that their <HI>own</HI> Actions are govern'd by rea&s;onable or moral Motives? Can the gluttonous Father expect a &s;elf-denying Son? With how ill a Grace mu&s;t a Man who will often be di&s;guis'd in Liquor, preach So|briety? A pa&s;&s;ionate Man, Patience? An irreligious Man, Piety? How will a Parent, who&s;e Hands are &s;eldom without Cards or Dice, be ob&s;erv'd in Le&s;&s;ons again&s;t the pernicious Vice of Gaming? Can the profu&s;e Father, who is &s;quandering away the Fortunes of his Children, expect to be regarded in a Le&s;&s;on of Frugality? 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould, except it were, that the Youth, &s;eeing how perni|cious his Father's Example is, &s;hould have the Grace to make a proper U&s;e of it, and look upon it as a
<PB N="354" REF="355">
Sea-mark, as it were, to enable him to &s;hun the dan|gerous Rocks, on which he &s;ees his Father &s;plitting. And even in this <HI>be&s;t</HI> Ca&s;e, let it be con&s;ider'd, how much Shame and Di&s;grace this thoughtle&s;s Parent ought to take to him&s;elf, who can admoni&s;h his Child by nothing but the <HI>Odiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of his own Vice; and how little it is owing to him, that his Guilt is not <HI>doubled,</HI> by his Son's treading in his Steps! Let &s;uch an unhappy Parent duly weigh this, and think how likely he may be, by his bad Ex|ample, to be the Cau&s;e of his Child's Perdition, as well as his own, and &s;tand un&s;hock'd and un|amended, if he can!</P>
<P>Give me Leave to add, That it is then of no Avail to wi&s;h for di&s;creet Servants, if the Conduct of the Parents is faulty. If the Fountain-head be polluted, how &s;hall the Under-currents run clear? That Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;s, who would exact from their Servants a Behaviour which they them&s;elves don't practi&s;e, will be but ill ob&s;erv'd. And that Child, who di&s;covers great Exce&s;&s;es and Errors in his Parents, will be found to be le&s;s profited by their good Precepts, than prejudic'd by their bad Exam|ples. Exce&s;&s;ive Fondne&s;s this Hour, violent Pa&s;|&s;ions, and perhaps Execrations, the next; unguarded Je&s;ts, an Admiration for fa&s;hionable Vanities, ra&s;h Cen&s;ures, are perhaps the be&s;t, that the Child &s;ees in, or hears from, tho&s;e who are mo&s;t concern'd to inculcate good Precepts into his Mind. And where it is &s;o, an Home Education is not by any means, &s;urely, to be cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Having, Sir, as well as my &s;lender Abilities will permit, pre&s;um'd to deliver my Opinion upon Three great Points, <HI>viz.</HI> The Qualifications of a Tutor; The Nece&s;&s;ity of having an Eye to the Morals of Servants; and, The Example of Parents (all which,
<PB N="355" REF="356">
being taken care of, gives a Preference, as I ima|gine, to an Home Education); permit me, dear Sir, to offer one more Point, on this Subject, to your Con&s;ideration, altho' I ju&s;t touch'd upon it before.</P>
<P>It is that of <HI>Emulation</HI>; which I humbly con|ceive to be of great Efficacy to lead Children on in their Duties and Studies. And how, dear Sir, &s;hall this Advantage be procur'd for a young Ma&s;ter, who has no Schoolfellows, and who has no Exam|ple to follow, but that of his Tutor, whom he can|not, from the Di&s;parity of Years, and other Cir|cum&s;tances, without Pain, (becau&s;e of this Di&s;parity) think of emulating? And this, I conceive, is a very great Advantage to &s;uch a School Education, as I mentioned in my former Letter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>332.</HI></NOTE>, where there are no more Scholars, than the Ma&s;ter can with Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure in&s;truct.</P>
<P>But one way, in my humble Opinion, is left to an&s;wer this Objection, and &s;till pre&s;erve the Rea|&s;on for the Preference which Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> gives to an Home Education; and that is, what I formerly hinted to you, dear Sir <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See p.</HI> 154, 155.</NOTE>, to take into your Family the Child of &s;ome hone&s;t Neighbour of but middling Circum&s;tances, and like Age with your own, but who &s;hould give apparent Indications of his natural Promptitude, ingenuous Temper, obliging Beha|viour, and good Manners; and to let him go hand-in-hand with yours in his &s;everal Studies and Le&s;&s;ons under the &s;ame Tutor.</P>
<P>This Child would be &s;en&s;ible of the Benefit, as well as the Di&s;tinction he receiv'd, and con&s;equently of what was expected from him, and would double his Diligence, and exert all his good Qualities, which would in&s;pire the young Gentleman with the
<PB N="356" REF="357">
wi&s;h'd-for Emulation, and, as I imagine, would be &s;o promotive of his Learning, that it would even greatly compen&s;ate the Tutor's Pains with the addi|tional Scholar; for the young Gentleman would be a&s;ham'd to be out-done by one of like Years and Stature with him&s;elf. And little Rewards might be propos'd to the greate&s;t Proficient, in order to heighten the Emulation.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, permit me to add, That the <HI>Gene|ro&s;ity</HI> of &s;uch a Method, to a Gentleman of your Fortune, and beneficent Mind, would be its own Reward, were there no other Benefit to be receiv'd by it.</P>
<P>Moreover, &s;uch an ingenious Youth might, by his good Morals and Indu&s;try, hereafter, be of Ser|vice in &s;ome Place of Tru&s;t in the Family; and it would be ea&s;y for a Gentleman of your Intere&s;t in the World, if &s;uch a thing offer'd not, to provide for the Youth in the Navy, in &s;ome of the publick Offices, or among your private Friends&mdash;If he prov'd faulty in his Morals, his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion would be in your own Power, and would be Puni&s;hment enough.</P>
<P>But if, on the other hand, he prov'd a &s;ober and hopeful Youth, &s;uch an one would make an excel|lent Companion for your <HI>Billy</HI> in riper Years; as he would be, in a manner, a Corroborator of his Morals; for, as his Circum&s;tances would not &s;upport him in any Extravagance, &s;o tho&s;e Circum&s;tances would be a Check upon his Inclinations; and this being &s;econded by the Hopes of future Preferment from your Favour and Intere&s;t, which he could not expect but upon the Terms of his Per&s;everance in Virtue, he would find him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting &s;uch an Example, as might be of great Benefit to his Companion: Who &s;hould be watch'd as he grew up,
<PB N="357" REF="358">
that he did not (if his ample Fortune became dan|gerous to his Virtue) contribute of his Affluence to draw the other after him into Extravagance. And to this End, as I humbly conceive, the noble Do|ctrine of <HI>Independence</HI> &s;hould be early in&s;till'd into both their Minds, and, upon all Occa&s;ions, inculcated and inforc'd; which would be an Inducement for the one to endeavour to <HI>improve</HI> his Fortune by his hone&s;t Indu&s;try, le&s;t he &s;hould never be inabled to ri&s;e out of a State of Dependence; and to the other, to <HI>keep,</HI> if not <HI>improve,</HI> his own, le&s;t he &s;hould ever fall into &s;uch a &s;ervile State, and thereby lo&s;e the glorious Power of conferring Obligations on the De&s;erving; which &s;urely is one of the highe&s;t Plea|&s;ures that a generous Mind can know.</P>
<P>A Plea&s;ure, Sir, which you have oftener expe|rienc'd than Thou&s;ands of Gentlemen: And which may you &s;till continue to experience for a long, long, and happy Succe&s;&s;ion of Years to come, is the Prayer of one, the mo&s;t oblig'd of all others in her own Per&s;on, as well as in the Per&s;ons of her deare&s;t Relations; and who owes to this glorious Beneficence the Honour &s;he boa&s;ts, of being</P>

<P>BUT now, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> if you will indulge me in a Letter or two more, preparative to my little Book, that I mention'd, I will take the Li|berty to touch upon one or two other Places, where|in I differ from this learned Gentleman. But, fir&s;t, permit me to ob&s;erve, that if Parents are, above all
<PB N="358" REF="359">
things, to avoid giving bad Examples to their Chil|dren, they will be no le&s;s careful to &s;hun the Pra|ctice of &s;uch fond Fathers and Mothers, as are wont to indulge their Children in bad Habits, and give them their Head, at a time when, like Wax, their tender Minds may be moulded into what Shape they plea&s;e. This is a Point, that, if it plea&s;e GOD, I will carefully attend to, becau&s;e it is the Foundation, on which the Super&s;tructure of the whole future Man is to be erected. For, according as he is in|dulg'd or check'd in his childi&s;h Follies, a Ground is laid for his future Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery; and if once they are &s;uffer'd to become habitual to him, it cannot but be expected, that they will grow up with him, and that they will hardly ever be eradicated. "Try it," &s;ays Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> &s;peaking to this very Point,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in a Dog, or an Hor&s;e, or any other Creature, and &s;ee whether the ill and re&s;ty Tricks they have learn'd when young, are ea&s;ily to be mended, when they are knit&punc; And yet none of the&s;e Creatures are half &s;o wilful and proud, or half &s;o de&s;irous to be Ma&s;ters of them&s;elves, as Men."</Q></P>
<P>And this brings me, dear Sir, to the Head of <HI>Puni&s;hments,</HI> in which, as well as in the Article of <HI>Rewards,</HI> which I have touch'd upon, I have a lit|tle Objection to &s;omewhat advanc'd by Mr. <HI>Locke.</HI></P>
<P>But permit me, Sir, however, to premi&s;e, that I am exceedingly pleas'd with the Method laid down by this excellent Writer, rather to &s;hame the Child out of his Fault, than beat him; which latter &s;erves generally for nothing but to harden his Mind.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;tinacy,</HI> and telling a <HI>Lye,</HI> and committing a <HI>wilful</HI> Fault, and then <HI>per&s;i&s;ting</HI> in it, are, I agree with this Gentleman, the only Cau&s;es for which the Child &s;hould be puni&s;h'd with Stripes: And I
<PB N="359" REF="360">
admire the Rea&s;ons he gives again&s;t a too rigorous and &s;evere Treatment of Children.</P>
<P>But I will give Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Words, to which I have &s;ome Objection.</P>
<P>"It may be doubted," &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"concerning Whipping, when, as the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Remedy, it comes to be nece&s;&s;ary, at <HI>what time,</HI> and by <HI>whom,</HI> it &s;hould be done; whether pre&s;ently, upon the committing the Fault, whil&s;t it is yet fre&s;h and hot&mdash;I think it &s;hould not be done pre&s;ently,"</Q>
adds he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"le&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion mingle with it; and &s;o, tho' it exceed the ju&s;t Proportion, yet it lo&s;e of its due Weight. For even Children di&s;cern when|ever we do things in a Pa&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg Leave, dear Sir, to differ from Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> in this Point; for I think it ought rather to be a Rule with Parents, who &s;hall cha&s;tize their Children, to conquer what would be extreme in <HI>their own</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion on this Occa&s;ion, (for tho&s;e Pa|rents, who cannot do it, are very unfit to be Pu|ni&s;hers of the wayward Pa&s;&s;ions of their Children) than to <HI>defer</HI> the Puni&s;hment, e&s;pecially if the Child knows its Fault has reach'd its Parent's Ear. It is otherwi&s;e, methinks, giving the Child, if of an ob|&s;tinate Di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o much more Time to harden its Mind, and bid Defiance to its Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t now, dear Sir, your <HI>Billy</HI> is brought into my Pre&s;ence, all &s;miling, crowing to come to me, and full of heart-chearing Promi&s;es; and the Subject I am upon goes to my Heart. Surely, &s;urely, I can never beat your <HI>Billy!</HI>&mdash;Dear little Life of my Life! how can I think thou can&s;t ever de&s;erve it, or I can ever inflict it?&mdash;No, my Baby, that &s;hall be thy Papa's Ta&s;k, if ever thou art &s;o heinou&s;ly naughty; and whatever <HI>he</HI> does, mu&s;t be right.&mdash;Pardon my fooli&s;h Fondne&s;s, dear Sir!&mdash;I will proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="361">If then, I humbly pre&s;ume to advi&s;e, the Fault be &s;o atrocious as to de&s;erve Whipping, and the Pa|rent be re&s;olv'd on this exemplary Puni&s;hment, by no means, I &s;hould imagine, ought the Child,&mdash;poor dear little Soul!&mdash;to come into one's Pre&s;ence with|out meeting his due Reward. For el&s;e, I &s;hould think, a Fondne&s;s too natural to be re&s;i&s;ted, will get the Upper-hand of one's Re&s;entment, and how &s;hall one be able to whip the dear Creature one can|not be angry with? Then after he has once &s;een one without meeting his Puni&s;hment, will he not be inclin'd to hope for Connivance at his Fault? And may he not be apt (for Childrens Re&s;entments are &s;trong) to impute to Cruelty, a Correction, that &s;hould always appear to be inflicted with Reluctance, and thro' Motives of Love?</P>
<P>If, from Anger at his Fault, one &s;hould go <HI>above the due Proportion,</HI> (I am &s;ure I might be tru&s;ted for this!) let it take its Cour&s;e!&mdash;How barbarou&s;ly, methinks, I &s;peak!&mdash;He ought to <HI>feel</HI> the La&s;h, fir&s;t, Becau&s;e he <HI>de&s;erves</HI> it, poor little Creature! Next, Becau&s;e it is <HI>propos'd</HI> to be exemplary. And la&s;tly, Becau&s;e it is not intended to be <HI>often</HI> us'd: And the very Pa&s;&s;ion or Di&s;plea&s;ure one expre&s;&s;es, (if it be not enormous) will &s;hew one is in Earne&s;t, and in&s;pire him with a nece&s;&s;ary Awe, and make him be afraid to offend again. The <HI>End</HI> of the Correction is to &s;hew him the Difference betwixt a kind Parent, and a provok'd one: And as it is pro|per to take him at his fir&s;t Offer of a full Submi&s;&s;ion and Repentance, (and not before) and in&s;tantly di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate one's &s;elf, and &s;hew him the Difference by Acts of Pardon and Kindne&s;s, (which will let him &s;ee, that one puni&s;hes him out of Nece&s;&s;ity ra|ther than Choice) &s;o one would not be afraid to make him &s;mart &s;o &s;ufficiently, that he &s;hould not
<PB N="361" REF="362">
&s;oon forget the Severity of the Di&s;cipline, nor the Di&s;grace of it. There's a cruel Mamma for you, Mr. <HI>B.!</HI> What my <HI>Practice</HI> may be, I can't tell; but this <HI>Theory,</HI> I pre&s;ume to think, is right.</P>
<P>As to the Act it&s;elf, I much approve Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Advice, to do it by Pau&s;es, mingling Stripes and Expo&s;tulations together, to &s;hame and terrify the more; and the rather, as the Parent, by this &s;low manner of inflicting the Puni&s;hment, will le&s;s need to be afraid of giving too violent a Correction; for tho&s;e Pau&s;es will afford <HI>him,</HI> as well as the <HI>Child,</HI> Opportunities for Con&s;ideration and Reflection.</P>
<P>But as to the Per&s;on, by whom the Di&s;ci|pline &s;hould be perform'd, I humbly conceive, that this excellent Author is here al&s;o to be objected to.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If you have a di&s;creet Servant," &s;ays he, "capable of it, and has the Place of governing your Child, (for if you have a Tutor, there is no Doubt) I think it is be&s;t the Smart &s;hould come immediately from another's Hand, tho' by the Parent's Order, who &s;hould &s;ee it done; whereby the Parent's Authority will be pre&s;erv'd, and the Child's Aver&s;ion for the Pain it &s;uffers, rather be turn'd on the Per&s;on that immediately inflicts it. For I would have a Father &s;eldom &s;trike the Child, but upon very urgent Nece&s;&s;ity, and as the la&s;t Remedy."</Q></P>
<P>'Tis in &s;uch an urgent Ca&s;e, dear Sir, that we are &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould be done at all. If there be not a Rea&s;on &s;trong enough for the Father's whip|ping the Child him&s;elf, there cannot be any &s;uffi|cient for his ordering any other to do it, and &s;tand|ing by to &s;ee it done: But, I humbly pre&s;ume to think, that if there be a Nece&s;&s;ity for it, no one can be &s;o fit as the Father him&s;elf to do it. The Child cannot di&s;pute <HI>his</HI> Authority to puni&s;h, from whom
<PB N="362" REF="363">
he receives and expects all the good Things of this Life: He cannot que&s;tion <HI>his</HI> Love to him, and, after the Smart is over, and his Obedience &s;ecur'd, mu&s;t believe that &s;o tender, &s;o indulgent a Father, could have no other End in whipping him, but his Good. Again&s;t him, he knows, he has no Re|medy, but mu&s;t pa&s;&s;ively &s;ubmit; and when he is convinc'd he <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> he will in time conclude, that he <HI>ought.</HI></P>
<P>But to have this &s;evere Office perform'd by a Servant, tho' at the Father's Command; and that profe&s;&s;edly, that the Aver&s;ion of the Child for the Pain it &s;uffers, &s;hould be turn'd on the Per&s;on who immediately inflicts it, is, I am humbly of Opi|nion, the <HI>Rever&s;e</HI> of what ought to be done. And <HI>more</HI> &s;o, if this Servant has any Direction of the Child's Education; and &s;till <HI>much</HI> more &s;o, if it be his Tutor, notwith&s;tanding Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;ays, there is no Doubt, if there be a Tutor, that it &s;hould be done by him.</P>
<P>For, dear Sir, is there no Doubt, that the Tutor &s;hould lay him&s;elf open to the Aver&s;ion of the Child, who&s;e Morals he is to direct, who&s;e Manners he is to form? Is it not the be&s;t Method a Tutor can take, in order to inforce the Le&s;&s;ons he would incul|cate, to endeavour to attract the Love and Attention of his Pupil by the mo&s;t winning, mild, and inviting Ways that he can po&s;&s;ibly think of? And yet is <HI>he,</HI> this very Tutor, <HI>out of all Doubt,</HI> to be the In&s;tru|ment of doing an har&s;h and di&s;graceful thing, and that in the la&s;t Re&s;ort, when all other Methods are found ineffectual; and that too, becau&s;e he ought to incur the Child's Re&s;entment and Aver&s;ion, ra|ther than the Father? No, &s;urely, Sir, it is not rea&s;onable it &s;hould be &s;o: Quite contrary, in my
<PB N="363" REF="364">
humble Notion, there can be no Doubt, that it &s;hould be <HI>otherwi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;hould, methinks, be enough for a Tutor, in ca&s;e of a Fault in the Child, to threaten to com|plain to his Father; but yet not to make &s;uch Com|plaint, without the Child ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ts in his Error, which, too, &s;hould be of a Nature to merit &s;uch an Appeal: And this, methinks, would highly contribute to pre&s;erve the Parent's Authority; who, on this Occa&s;ion, &s;hould never fail of extorting a Promi&s;e of Amendment, or of in&s;tantly puni&s;hing him with his own Hands. And, to heighten the E&s;teem of the Child to his Tutor, and to reconcile him to him for complaining of him, it might not, po&s;&s;ibly, be ami&s;s, that his Interpo&s;ition in the Child's Favour, if the Fault were not too flagrant, &s;hould be permitted to &s;ave him once or twice from the impending Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, that the Pa&s;&s;ions, if I may &s;o call them, of Affection and Aver&s;ion are very early di&s;|coverable in Children; in&s;omuch that they will, even before they can &s;peak, afford us Marks for the Detection of an hypocritical Appearance of Love to it before the Parents Faces. For the Fond|ne&s;s or Aver&s;ene&s;s of the Child to &s;ome Servants, as I have ob&s;erv'd in other Families, will at any time let one know, whether their Love to the Baby is uniform and the &s;ame, when one is ab&s;ent, as pre|&s;ent. For in one Ca&s;e the Child will reject with Sullenne&s;s all the little Sycophancies, that are made to it in one's Sight; while, on the other, its Fond|ne&s;s of one, who generally obliges it, is an infallible Rule to judge of &s;uch an one's Sincerity behind one's Back. This little In&s;tance &s;hews the Strength of a Child's Re&s;entments, and its Sagacity, at the ear|lie&s;t Age, in di&s;covering who obliges, and who di&s;|obliges
<PB N="364" REF="365">
it: And hence one may infer, how improper a Per&s;on <HI>he</HI> is, whom we would have a Child to love and re&s;pect, or by who&s;e Precepts we would have it directed, to be the Puni&s;her of his Faults, or to do any har&s;h or di&s;agreeable Office to it.</P>
<P>For my own Part, dear Sir, I mu&s;t take the Li|berty to declare, that if the Parent were not to in|flict the Puni&s;hment him&s;elf, I think it much better it &s;hould be given him, in the Parent's Pre&s;ence, by the Servant of the lowe&s;t Con&s;ideration in the Fa|mily, and one who&s;e Manners and Example one would be the lea&s;t willing of any other he &s;hould follow. Ju&s;t as the common Executioner, who is the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t flagitious Officer of the Com|monwealth, and who frequently de&s;erves, as much as the Criminal, the Puni&s;hment he is cho&s;en to in|flict, is pitch'd upon to perform, as a Mark of greater Ignominy, tho&s;e Sentences which are in|tended as Examples to deter others from the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of heinous Crimes. And this was the Me|thod the Almighty took, when he was di&s;pos'd to correct &s;everely his cho&s;en People: For in that Ca&s;e He generally did it by the Hands of the mo&s;t profli|gate Nations around them, as we read in many Places of the Old Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>But the following Rule, among a thou&s;and others, equally excellent, I admire in Mr. <HI>Locke:</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When," &s;ays he, "(for any Mi&s;demeanour) the Father or Mother looks &s;our on the Child, every one el&s;e &s;hould put on the &s;ame Coldne&s;s to him, and no|body give him Countenance till Forgivene&s;s a&s;k'd, and a Reformation of his Fault has &s;et him right again, and re&s;tor'd him to his former Credit. If this were con&s;tantly ob&s;erv'd,"</Q>
adds he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I gue&s;s there would be little Need of Blows or Chiding: Their own Ea&s;e or Satisfaction would
<PB N="365" REF="366">
quickly teach Children to court Commendation, and avoid doing that which they found every body condemn'd, and they were &s;ure to &s;uffer for, without being chid or beaten. This would teach them Mode&s;ty and Shame, and they would quickly come to have a natural Abhorrence for that which they found made them &s;lighted and neglected by every body."</Q></P>
<P>This affords me, dear Sir, a pretty Hint: For if ever your charming <HI>Billy</HI> &s;hould be naughty, what would I do, but proclaim throughout your worthy Family, that the little Dear was in Di&s;grace! And one &s;hould &s;hun him, another &s;hould decline an|&s;wering him, a third &s;hould &s;ay, No, Ma&s;ter, I cannot obey you, till your Mamma is pleas'd with you: A fourth, Who &s;hould mind what little Ma|&s;ters bid them do, when little Ma&s;ters won't mind what their Mamma's &s;ay to them? And when the dear little Soul found this, he would come in my Way, and I &s;ee (pardon me, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI>) he has &s;ome of his Papa's Spirit already, indeed he has! and I will direct my&s;elf with double Kindne&s;s to your beloved <HI>Davers,</HI> and to my Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and take no Notice at all of the dear Creature, if I can help it, till I &s;ee his Papa (forgive my Boldne&s;s, Sir) bani&s;h'd from his little &s;ullen Brow, and all his Mamma ri&s;e to his Eyes: And when his mu&s;ical Tongue &s;hall be unlock'd to own his Fault, and promi&s;e Amendment&mdash;O then! how &s;hall I cla&s;p him to my Bo&s;om! and Tears of Joy, I know, will meet his Tears of Penitence!&mdash;How the&s;e Flights, dear Sir, plea&s;e a body!&mdash;What Delights have tho&s;e Mamma's, (which &s;ome fa&s;hionable La|dies are quite unacquainted with) who can make their dear Babies, and their fir&s;t Educations, their Entertainment and Diver&s;ion!

<HEAD>LETTER LVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. <HI>Locke</HI> gives a great many very pretty In|&s;tructions relating to the Play-games of Chil|dren;
<PB N="367" REF="368">
but I humbly pre&s;ume to think what he &s;ays, in one or two Places, a little objectionable.</P>
<P>He would not indulge them in any Playthings, but what they make them&s;elves, or endeavour to make.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A &s;mooth Pebble, a Piece of Paper, the Mother's Bunch of Keys, or any thing they can|not hurt them&s;elves with,"</Q>
he rightly &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;erves as much to divert little Children, as tho&s;e more chargeable and curious Toys from the Shops, which are pre&s;ently put out of Order, and broken."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Playthings may certainly do well enough, as he ob&s;erves, for little ones: But, methinks, to a Per&s;on of ea&s;y Circum&s;tances, as the making the&s;e Toys imploys the indu&s;trious Poor, the buying them for the Child might be di&s;pens'd with, tho' they <HI>were</HI> ea&s;ily broken; and e&s;pecially as they are of all Prices, and &s;ome le&s;s co&s;tly, and more durable, than others.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tops, Gigs, Battledors," Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> ob|&s;erves,
"which are to be u&s;ed with Labour, &s;hould indeed be procur'd them&mdash;not for Variety, but Exerci&s;e: But if they had a Top, the Scourge-&s;tick and Leather-&s;trap &s;hould be left to their own making and fitting."</Q></P>
<P>But may I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, That whatever be the Good Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> propo&s;es by this, it cannot be equal to the Mi&s;chief Children may do them&s;elves in making the&s;e Playthings? For mu&s;t they not have Implements to work with? And is not a Knife, or other edg'd Tool, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible they can make or &s;hape a Scourge-&s;tick, or <HI>any</HI> of their Playthings, a fine In&s;trument in a Child's Hands? This Advice is the Rever&s;e of the Caution warranted from all Antiquity, <HI>That 'tis dangerous to meddle with edg'd Tools:</HI> And I am
<PB N="368" REF="369">
afraid, the Tutor mu&s;t often act the Surgeon, and follow the Indulgence with a Styptick and a Plai&s;ter; and the young Gentleman's Hands might be &s;o often bound up, that it might indeed perhaps be one way to cure him of his earne&s;t De&s;ire to play; but I can hardly imagine any other Good that it can do him: For I doubt, the excellent Con&s;equences propos'd by our Author from this Doctrine, &s;uch as to teach the Child Moderation in his De&s;ires, Application, Indu&s;try, Thought, Contrivance, and good Hu&s;|bandry, Qualities that, as he ob&s;erves, will be u&s;e|ful to him when he is a Man, are too remote to be ingrafted upon &s;uch Beginnings: Altho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> wi&s;ely ob&s;erves, good Habits and Indu&s;try cannot be too early inculcated.</P>
<P>But then, Sir, may I a&s;k, Are not the very Play and Sports, to which Children accu&s;tom them|&s;elves, whether they make their own Playthings or not, equivalent to the Work or Labour of grown Per&s;ons? Yes, Sir, I will venture to &s;ay, they are, and more than equivalent to the Exerci&s;es and La|bour of many.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> advi&s;es, that the Child's Playthings &s;hould be as few as po&s;&s;ible, which I intirely agree with: That they &s;hould be in his Tutor's Power, who is to give him but one at once: But as it is the Nature of the human Mind to court mo&s;t what is prohibited, and to &s;et light by what is in its own Power; &s;o I am half doubtful, (only that Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;ays it, and the Matter may not be &s;o very import|ant, as other Points, in which I have taken the Li|berty to differ from that Gentleman) Whether the Child's ab&s;olute Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own Playthings in &s;ome little Repo&s;itory, of which he may be per|mitted to keep the Key, e&s;pecially if he make no bad U&s;e of the Privilege, would not make him
<PB N="369" REF="370">
more indifferent to them; while the contrary Con|duct might po&s;&s;ibly inhance his Value of them. And if, when he had done with any Plaything, he were oblig'd to put it into its allotted Place, and was ac|cu&s;tom'd to keep Account of the Number and Places of them &s;everally, this would teach him Order, and at the &s;ame time in&s;truct him to make a proper Ac|count of them, and to avoid being a Squanderer or Wa&s;ter: And if he &s;hould omit to put them in their Places, or be carele&s;s of his Playthings, the Com|mand of them taken away for a time, or threatening to give them away to others, would make him be more heedful.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he has known a Child &s;o di&s;tracted with the Number and Variety of his Play-games, that he tired his Maid every Day to look them over: And was &s;o accu&s;tom'd to Abundance, that he never thought he had enough, but was always a&s;king, What more? What new thing &s;hall I have? A good Introduction,"</Q>
adds he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to moderate De&s;ires, and the ready way to make a contented happy Man!"</Q></P>
<P>All that I &s;hall offer to this, is, that there are few <HI>Men</HI> &s;o philo&s;ophical as one would wi&s;h them to be; much le&s;s <HI>Children.</HI> But no Doubt, that this Variety engag'd the Child's Activity; which, of the two, might be turn'd to better Purpo&s;es, than Sloth or Indolence; and if the Maid was tired, it might be, becau&s;e &s;he was not &s;o much alive, as the Child; and perhaps the Grievance might not be &s;o great, becau&s;e, if &s;he was his Attendant, 'tis pro|bable &s;he had nothing el&s;e to do.</P>
<P>However, in the main, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;ays, it is no matter how few Playthings the Child is indulg'd with: But yet I can hardly per&s;uade my&s;elf, that Plenty of them can have &s;uch bad Con&s;equences, as
<PB N="370" REF="371">
the Gentleman apprehends; and the rather, becau&s;e they will excite his Attention, and keep alive his In|du&s;try and Activity. His Inquiry after new Things, let him have few or many, is to be expected as a Branch of tho&s;e natural De&s;ires, which are im|planted in him, and will every Day increa&s;e: But this may be ob&s;erv'd, That as he grows in Years, he will be above &s;ome Playthings, and &s;o the Num|ber of the old ones will be always reducible, per|haps, in a greater Proportion, than the new ones will increa&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> ob&s;erves, on the Head of good Breed|ing, That
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There are two Sorts of ill Breeding; the one a &s;heepi&s;h Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and the other a mi&s;becoming Negligence and Di&s;re&s;pect in our Carriage; both which, &s;ays he, are avoided by duly ob&s;erving this one Rule, Not to think meanly of our&s;elves, and not to think meanly of others."</Q>
I think, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> explains this Rule, it is an excellent one. But on this Head I would beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that however di&s;com|mendable a ba&s;hful Temper is, in &s;ome In&s;tances, where it mu&s;t be deem'd a Weakne&s;s of the Mind, yet, in my humble Opinion, it is generally the Mark of an ingenuous one, and is always to be preferr'd to an undi&s;tingui&s;hing and hardy Confi|dence, which is, as it &s;eems to me, the genuine Production of unfeeling Ignorance.</P>
<P>What is faulty in it, which Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> calls <HI>Sheepi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> &s;hould indeed be &s;haken off as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e it is an Enemy to Merit in its Ad|vancement in the World: But were I to chu&s;e a Companion for your <HI>Billy,</HI> as he grows up, I &s;hould not think the wor&s;e of the Youth, who, not having had the Opportunities of knowing Men, or &s;eeing the World, had this Defect. On the contrary,

I &s;hould be apt to look upon it as an outward Fence or Inclo&s;ure, as I may &s;ay, to his Virtue, which might keep off the lighter Attacks of Immorality, the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> of Vice, as I may &s;ay, who are not able to carry on a formal Siege again&s;t his Morals; and I &s;hould expect &s;uch an one to be docile, hu|mane, good-humour'd, diffident of him&s;elf, and &s;o mo&s;t likely to improve as well in Mind as Behavi|our: While an harden'd Mind, that never doubts it&s;elf, mu&s;t be a Stranger to its own Infirmities, and, &s;u&s;pecting none, is impetuous, over-bearing, incorrigible; and if rich, a Tyrant; if not, po&s;&s;i|bly an Invader of other Mens Properties.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> propo&s;es (&sect; 148.) a very pretty Me|thod to cheat Children, as it were, into Learning: But then, he adds,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There may be Dice and Playthings with the Letters on them to teach Children the Alphabet by playing."</Q>
And in an|other Place, (&sect; 151.)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know a Per&s;on of great Quality&mdash;who by pa&s;ting on the &s;ix Vowels (for in our Language <HI>y</HI> is one) on the &s;ix Sides of a Die, and the remaining eighteen Con&s;onants on the Sides of three other Dice, has made this a Play for his Children, that he &s;hall win, who at one Ca&s;t throws mo&s;t Words on the&s;e four Dice; whereby his elde&s;t Son, yet in Coats, has <HI>play'd</HI> him&s;elf <HI>into Spelling</HI> with great Eagerne&s;s, and without once having been chid for it, or forced to it."</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that I &s;hould rather your <HI>Billy</HI> &s;hould be a Twelvemonth back|warder for want of this Method, than forwarded by it. For what may not be apprehended from &s;o early inculcating the U&s;e of Dice and Gaming upon the Minds of Children? Let Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> him&s;elf &s;peak for this in his &sect; 208. and I &s;hould be glad to be able
<PB N="372" REF="373">
to reconcile the two Pa&s;&s;ages in this excellent Au|thor.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As to Cards and Dice," &s;ays he, "I think the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t way is never to learn any Play upon them, and &s;o to be incapacitated for the&s;e dangerous Temptations, and incroach|ing Wa&s;ters of u&s;eful Time"</Q>
&mdash;and, he might have added, of the noble&s;t E&s;tates and Fortunes; while Sharpers and Scoundrels have been listed into Di&s;tinction upon their Ruins. Yet, in &sect; 153. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> proceeds to give particular Directions in rela|tion to the Dice he recommends.</P>
<P>But, after all, if &s;ome innocent Plays were fix'd upon to cheat Children into Reading, that, as he &s;ays, &s;hould look as little like a Ta&s;k as po&s;&s;ible, it mu&s;t needs be of U&s;e for that Purpo&s;e. But let every Gentleman, who has a Fortune to lo&s;e, and who, if he games, is on a foot with the vile&s;t Com|pany, who generally have nothing at all to ri&s;que, tremble at the Thoughts of teaching his Son, tho' for the mo&s;t laudable Purpo&s;es, the early U&s;e of Dice and Gaming.</P>
<P>But, dear Sir, permit me to &s;ay, how much I am charm'd with an Hint in Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> which makes your <HI>Pamela</HI> hope, &s;he may be of greater U&s;e to your Children, even as they <HI>grow up,</HI> than &s;he could ever have flatter'd her&s;elf to be.&mdash;'Tis a charming, charming Paragraph; I mu&s;t not &s;kip one Word of it. Thus it begins, and I will ob|&s;erve upon it as I go along.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&sect; 177. But under who&s;e Care &s;oever a Child is put to be taught,"</Q>
&s;ays Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"during the tender and flexible Years of his Life, this is certain, it &s;hould be one, who thinks <HI>Latin</HI> and Language the lea&s;t Part of Education."</Q></P>
<P>How agreeable is this to my Notions; which I dur&s;t not have avow'd, but after &s;o excellent a Scho|lar:
<PB N="373" REF="374">
For I have long had the Thought, that a deal of precious Time is wa&s;ted to little Purpo&s;e in the Attaining of <HI>Latin.</HI> Mr. <HI>H.</HI> I think, &s;ays, he was Ten Years in endeavouring to learn it, and, as far as I can find, knows nothing at all of the Matter neither!&mdash;Indeed he lays that to the wicked Picture in his Grammar, which he took for granted, as he has &s;aid &s;everal times, as well as once <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. III. <HI>p.</HI> 406.</NOTE> written, was put there to teach Boys to rob Orchards, in|&s;tead of improving their Minds in Learning, or common Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>But (for this is too light an In&s;tance for the Sub|ject) Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> proceeds&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"One who, knowing how much Virtue and a well-temper'd Soul is to be preferr'd to any &s;ort of <HI>Learning</HI> or <HI>Lan|guage,</HI>"</Q>
[What a noble Writer is this!]

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Which if once got, tho' all the re&s;t &s;hould be neglected,"</Q>

[Now comes the Place I am &s;o much delighted with!]
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And indeed, whatever Stir there is made about getting of <HI>Latin,</HI> as the great and difficult Bu&s;ine&s;s, his Mother"</Q>
[O thank you, thank you, dear Sir, for putting this excellent Author into my Hands!]

[Why, deare&s;t, dear Sir, you have taught me almo&s;t all this already; and you, my be&s;t and mo&s;t beloved Tutor, have told me often, I read and pronounce <HI>Latin</HI> more than tole|rably, tho' I don't under&s;tand it: But this Method will teach <HI>me,</HI> as well as your dear <HI>Children.</HI> But thus the good Gentleman proceeds:]
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And when &s;he under&s;tands the Evangeli&s;ts in <HI>Latin,</HI> let her in the &s;ame manner read <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s Fables, and &s;o proceed on to <HI>Eutropius, Ju&s;tin,</HI> and &s;uch other Books. I do not mention this,"</Q>
adds Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as an Imagination of what I fan&s;y <HI>may</HI> do, but as of a thing I have <HI>known</HI> done, and the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue got with Ea&s;e this way."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> proceeds to mention other Advantages, which the Child may receive from his Mother's In|&s;truction, which I will endeavour more and more to qualify my&s;elf for: Particularly, after he has inti|mated, That
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At the &s;ame time the Child is learn|ing <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> he may be enter'd al&s;o in Arithmetick, Geography, Chronology, Hi&s;tory, and Geometry too; for if,"</Q>
&s;ays he,

<PB N="375" REF="376">
will get a Knowlege in the&s;e Sciences, and the Language to boot:"</Q>
After he has intimated this, I &s;ay, he proceeds:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Geography, I think, &s;hould be begun with: For the learning of the Figure of the Globe, the Situation and Bounda|ries of the Four Parts of the World, and that of particular Kingdoms and Countries, being only an Exerci&s;e of the Eyes and Memory, a Child with Plea&s;ure will learn and retain them. And this is &s;o certain, that I now live in an Hou&s;e with a Child, whom his MOTHER has &s;o well instructed this way in Geography,"</Q>
[But had &s;he not, do you think, dear Sir, &s;ome of this good Gentleman's kind A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as he liv'd in the Hou&s;e with the Child?]
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he knew the Li|mits of the Four Parts of the World; would rea|dily point, being a&s;k'd, to any Country upon the Globe, or any County in the Map of <HI>Eng|land</HI>; knew all the great Rivers, Promontories, Streights, and Bays in the World, and could find the Longitude and Latitude of any Place, before he was &s;ix Years old."</Q></P>
<P>There's for you, dear Sir!&mdash;See what a Mother can do, if &s;he plea&s;es!</P>
<P>I remember, Sir, formerly, in that &s;weet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 61,&mdash;65.</NOTE> Cha|riot Conference, at the Dawning of my Hopes, when all my Dangers were over; a Conference I &s;till think of with Plea&s;ure; that you a&s;k'd me, how I would be&s;tow my Time, &s;uppo&s;ing the neighbour|ing Ladies would be above being &s;een in my Com|pany; when I &s;hould have no Vi&s;its to receive or return; no Parties of Plea&s;ure to join in; no Card-tables to imploy my Winter Evenings?</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="377">I then, Sir, tran&s;ported with my opening Pro&s;pects, prattled to you, how well I would endeavour to pa&s;s my Time in the Family Management and Ac|counts, in Vi&s;its now-and-then to the indigent and worthy Poor; in Mu&s;ick &s;ometimes; in Reading, in Writing, in my &s;uperior Duties&mdash;And I hope I have not behaved quite unworthily of my Promi&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My deare&s;t Mr.</HI> B.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving in my former Letters &s;aid as much as is nece&s;&s;ary to let you into my Notion of the excellent Book you put into my Hands, and having
<PB N="378" REF="379">
touch'd tho&s;e Points in which the Children of both Sexes may be concern'd, (with &s;ome <HI>Art</HI> in my In|tention, I own) in Hopes that they would not be &s;o much out of the way, as to make you repent of the Honour and Plea&s;ure you have done me in commit|ting the dear Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI> to my Care; I &s;hall now very quickly &s;et my&s;elf about the little Book which I have done my&s;elf the Honour to mention to you.</P>
<P>You have been &s;o good as to tell me, (at the &s;ame time that you have not di&s;approv'd the&s;e my Speci|men Letters, as I may call them) that you will kindly accept of my intended Pre&s;ent, and you en|courage me to proceed in it; and as I &s;hall leave one Side of the Leaf blank for your Corrections and Al|terations, tho&s;e Corrections will be a fine Help and In&s;truction to me in the plea&s;ing Ta&s;k, which I propo&s;e to my&s;elf, of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the early Education of the dear Children, which it has plea&s;ed God to give you. And altho' I &s;hall be Years in writing it, perhaps, as the dear Babies improve, and as I improve, by the Opportunities which their Advances in Years will give me, and the Experience I &s;hall gain, I &s;hall, perhaps, venture to give my Notions and Ob&s;ervations on the more material and nobler Parts of Education, as well as the inferior; for, (but that I think the Subjects above my pre&s;ent Abilities) Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Book would lead me into &s;everal Re|marks, that might not be unu&s;eful, and which ap|pear to me intirely new; tho' that may be owing to my &s;lender Reading and Opportunities perhaps.</P>
<P>But what, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I would now touch upon, is a Word or two &s;till more particu|larly upon the Education of my own Sex; a To|pick which naturally ri&s;es to me from the Subject of my la&s;t Letter. For there, dear Sir, we &s;aw, that
<PB N="379" REF="380">
the Mothers might teach the Child this Part of Science, and that Part of In&s;truction; and who, I pray, as our Sex is generally educated, &s;hall teach the <HI>Mothers?</HI> How, in a Word, &s;hall they come by their Knowlege?</P>
<P>I know you'll be apt to &s;ay, That Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI> gives all the Promi&s;es of a fine young Lady, and takes her Learning, and loves Reading, and makes very pretty Reflections on all &s;he reads, and a&s;ks very pertinent Que&s;tions, and is as knowing, at her Years, as mo&s;t young Ladies. This is very true, Sir; but it is not every one that can boa&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI>'s Capacity, and Goodne&s;s of Temper, which have enabled her to get up a good deal of lo&s;t Time, as I mu&s;t call it; for the fir&s;t four Years in the dear Child were a perfect Blank, as far as I can find, ju&s;t as if the pretty Dear was born the Day &s;he was four Years old: For what &s;he had to <HI>un|learn</HI> as to Temper, and Will, and &s;uch things, &s;et again&s;t what little Improvements &s;he had made, might very fairly be compounded for, as a Blank.</P>
<P>I would indeed have a Mi&s;s brought up to her Needle; but I would not have <HI>all</HI> her Time im|ploy'd in Samplers, and learning to mark, and to do tho&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary things, which &s;he will never, probably, be call'd upon to practi&s;e.</P>
<P>And why, pray, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> are not Girls intitled to the &s;ame fir&s;t Education, tho' not to the &s;ame Plays and Diver&s;ions, as Boys; &s;o far at lea&s;t, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> a Mother can in|&s;truct them?</P>
<P>Would not this lay a Foundation for their future Improvement, and direct their Inclinations to u&s;eful Subjects, &s;uch as &s;hould make them above the Im|putations of &s;ome unkind Gentlemen, who allot to their Parts common Tea-table Prattle, while they
<PB N="380" REF="381">
do all they can to make them fit for nothing el&s;e, and then upbraid them for it? And would not the Men find us better and more &s;uitable Companions and A&s;&s;i&s;tants to them in every u&s;eful Purpo&s;e of Life?&mdash;O that your lordly Sex were all like my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;I don't mean, that they &s;hould all take raw, uncouth, unbred, lowly Girls, as I was, from the Cottage, and, de&s;troying all Di&s;tinction, make &s;uch their Wives. I cannot mean this: Be|cau&s;e it is a far greater Likelihood, that &s;uch an one, when &s;he comes to be lifted up into &s;o dazzling a Sphere, would have her Head made giddy with her Exaltation, than that &s;he would balance her&s;elf well in it: And then to what a Blot, over all the fair Page of a long Life, would this little Drop of dirty Ink &s;pread it&s;elf! What a &s;tanding Di&s;reputation to the Choice of a Gentleman!</P>
<P>But <HI>this</HI> I mean, that after a Gentleman: had en|ter'd into the Marriage State with a young Creature (&s;aying nothing at all of Birth or De&s;cent) far infe|rior to him in Learning, in Parts, in Knowlege of the World, and in all the Graces that make Conver&s;ation agreeable and improving, he would, as you do, endeavour to make her fit Company for him&s;elf, as he &s;hall find &s;he is <HI>willing</HI> to improve, and <HI>capable</HI> of Improvement: That he would di|rect her Ta&s;te, point out to her proper Subjects for her Amu&s;ement and In&s;truction; travel with her now-and-then, a Month in a Year perhaps; and &s;hew her the World, after he has encourag'd her to put her&s;elf forward at his own Table, and at the Hou&s;es of his Friends, and has &s;een, that &s;he will not do him great Di&s;credit any-where. What Obligations, and Opportunities too, will this give her to love and honour &s;uch an Hu&s;band, every Hour, more and more! as &s;he will &s;ee his Wi&s;|dom
<PB N="381" REF="382">
in a thou&s;and In&s;tances, and experience his In|dulgence to her in ten thou&s;and, (for which other|wi&s;e no Opportunity could have &s;o fitly offer'd) to the Prai&s;e of his Politene&s;s, and the Honour of them bath!&mdash;And then, when &s;elect Parties of Plea&s;ure or Bu&s;ine&s;s engag'd him not abroad, in his home Conver&s;ation, to have him, as my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> does, delight to in&s;truct, and open her Pro&s;pects, and in&s;pire her with an Ambition to inlarge her Mind, and more and more to excel! What an intellectual Kind of marry'd Life, as I may call it, would &s;uch Per|&s;ons find theirs! And how &s;uitable to the Rules of Policy and Self-love in the Gentleman! For is not the Wife, and are not her Improvements, all <HI>his own? Absolutely</HI>&mdash;, as I may &s;ay, <HI>his own?</HI> And does not every Excellence &s;he can be adorned by, redound to her Husband's Honour, becau&s;e &s;he is <HI>his,</HI> even more than <HI>to her own?</HI>&mdash; In like manner as no Di&s;honour affects a Man &s;o much, as that which he receives from a bad Wife.</P>
<P>But where, would &s;ome &s;ay, were they to &s;ee what I write, is &s;uch a Gentlemen as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to be met with? Look around, and &s;ee, with all the Ad|vantages of Sex, of Education, of Travel, of Con|ver&s;ation in the open World, where a Gentleman of his Abilities to in&s;truct and inform, is to be found? And there are others, who, perhaps, will que&s;tion the Capacities and Inclinations of our Sex in general, to improve in u&s;eful Knowlege, were they to meet with &s;uch kind Indulgers, either in the Cha|racters of a Parent or Husband.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, I grant, that it is not ea&s;y to find &s;uch a Gentleman: But for the &s;econd, (would it be excus'd in me, who am one of the Sex, and &s;o may be thought partial to it) I could, by Compa|ri&s;ons drawn from the Gentlemen and Ladies within
<PB N="382" REF="383">
the Circle of my own Acquaintance, produce In|&s;tances to the Advantage of Ladies, which are &s;o flagrantly in their Favour, that might make it &s;u|&s;pected, that it is Policy more than Ju&s;tice, in tho&s;e who would keep our Sex unacquainted with that more eligible Turn of Education, which gives the Gentlemen &s;o many Advantages over us in <HI>that</HI>; and which will &s;hew, that they have none at all in <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Genius.</HI></P>
<P>I know you'll pardon me, dear Sir! for you are &s;o exalted above your <HI>Pamela,</HI> by Nature and Edu|cation too, that you cannot apprehend any Incon|venience from bold Compari&s;ons. I will take the Liberty therefore to mention a few In&s;tances among our Friends, where the Ladies, notwith&s;tanding their more cramp'd and confin'd Education, make more than an equal Figure with the Gentlemen in all the graceful Parts of Conver&s;ation, in Spite of the Con|tempts pour'd out upon our Sex by &s;ome witty Gentlemen, who&s;e Writings I have in my Eye.</P>
<P>To begin then with Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Darn|ford</HI> that was: Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> has the Reputation of Scholar&s;hip, and has travell'd too; but how infinitely is he &s;urpa&s;s'd in every noble and u&s;eful Quality, and in Greatne&s;s of Mind, and Judgment, as well as Wit, by the young Lady I have nam'd? This we &s;aw, when la&s;t at the Hall, in Fifty In&s;tances, where the Gentleman was, you know, Sir, on a Vi&s;it to Sir <HI>Simon</HI> and his Lady.</P>
<P>Next, dear Sir, permit me to ob&s;erve, that my good Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> with all his Advantages, born a Coun&s;ellor of the Realm, and educated accordingly; does not &s;urpa&s;s his Lady, your noble Si&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> Counte&s;s, as I delight to call her, and Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> her elde&s;t Daughter, greatly &s;urpa&s;s the Earl, and my Lord, her elde&s;t Brother, in every Point of
<PB N="383" REF="384">
Knowlege, and even Learning, as I may &s;ay, altho' both Ladies owe that Advantage principally to their own Cultivation and Acquirement.</P>
<P>Let me pre&s;ume, Sir, to name Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and when I <HI>have</HI> nam'd him, &s;hall we be puzzled to find any-where in our Sex, one Remove from vulgar Life, a Woman that will not out-do Mr. <HI>H.?</HI></P>
<P>Lady <HI>Darnford,</HI> upon all u&s;eful Subjects, makes a much brighter Figure than Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> who&s;e Knowlege of the World has not yet made him acquainted with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Arthur</HI> excels not his Lady.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> a Maiden Lady, is an Over-match for half a dozen of the neighbouring Gentlemen I could name, in what is call'd Wit and Politene&s;s, and not inferior to any of them in Judgment.</P>
<P>I could multiply In&s;tances of this Nature, were it needful, to the Confutation of that low, and I had almo&s;t &s;aid <HI>unmanly</HI> Contempt, with which a certain celebrated Genius treats our Sex in general, in mo&s;t of his Pieces that I have &s;een; particularly in his <HI>Letter of Advice to a new-marry'd Lady:</HI> A Letter written in &s;uch a manner, as mu&s;t di&s;gu&s;t, in|&s;tead of in&s;tructing, and looks more like the Advice of an Enemy to the Sex, and a partial one too, than a Friend to the particular Lady. But I ought to beg Pardon for this my Pre&s;umption, for two Rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, Becau&s;e of the truly admirable Talents of this Writer; and next, Becau&s;e we know not what Ladies the ingenious Gentleman may have fallen among in his younger Days.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole therefore I conclude, That Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the noble-minded Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is almo&s;t the only Gen|tleman, who excels <HI>every</HI> Lady I have &s;een; &s;o <HI>greatly</HI> excels, that even the Emanations of his Excellence irradiate a low Cottage-born Girl, and make her pa&s;s among Ladies of Birth and Education for Somebody.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="385">Forgive my Pride, dear Sir; but it would be almo&s;t a Crime in your <HI>Pamela</HI> not to glory in the mild Benignity of tho&s;e Rays, by which her beloved Mr. <HI>B.</HI> endeavours to make her look up to his own funny Sphere; while &s;he, by the Advantages only of his reflected Glory, in his Ab&s;ence, which makes a dark Night to her, glides along with her paler and fainter Beamine&s;s, and makes a di&s;tingui&s;hing Figure among &s;uch le&s;&s;er Planets, as can only poorly twinkle and glimmer, for want of the Aids &s;he boa&s;ts of: Tho', after all, her &s;ilvery Lu&s;tre is ea&s;ily over|&s;hadow'd by tho&s;e cro&s;&s;ing Clouds, that make his Glory &s;hine the brighter.</P>
<P>I dare not, dear Sir, conjecture, whence ari&s;es this more than Parity in the Genius of the Sexes, among the Per&s;ons I have mention'd, notwith&s;tand|ing the Di&s;parity of Education, and the Difference in the Opportunities of each. It might lead one into too proud a Thought in Favour of a Sex too contemptuou&s;ly treated by &s;ome <HI>other</HI> Wits I might name, who, indeed, are the le&s;s to be regarded, as they love to je&s;t upon all God Almighty's Works: Yet might I better do it, too, than any body, &s;ince, as I have intimated above, I am &s;o infinitely tran|&s;cended by my dear Gentleman, that no Compe|tition, Pride or Vanity, could be apprehended from me.</P>
<P>But, however, I would only beg of the Gentle|men, who are &s;o free in their Contempts of us, that they will, for <HI>their own</HI> &s;akes, (and that, with &s;uch, generally goes a great way) rather try to <HI>improve</HI> than <HI>depreciate</HI> us: We &s;hall then make bet|ter Daughters, better Wives, better Mothers, and better Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es: And who (permit me, Sir, to ask the&s;e People) would be &s;o much the better for the&s;e Opportunities and Amendments, as our Upbraiders them&s;elves?</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="386">On re-peru&s;ing what I have written, I mu&s;t re|peatedly beg your Excu&s;e, dear Sir, for the&s;e proud Notions in behalf of my Sex. I can truly &s;ay, That they are not, if I know my&s;elf, owing to Partiality, becau&s;e I have the Honour to be one of it; but to a better Motive by far: For what does this con|temptuous Treatment of one Half, if not the better Half, of the human Species, naturally produce, but Libertini&s;m, and abandon'd Wickedne&s;s? For does it not tend to make the Daughters, the Si&s;ters, the Wives of Gentlemen, the Subjects of profligate Attempts? &mdash; Does it not render the Sex vile in the Eyes of the mo&s;t Vile? And when a Lady is no longer beheld by &s;uch Per&s;ons with that Dignity and Reverence, with which, perhaps, the Graces of her Per&s;on, and the Innocence of her Mind, &s;hould &s;acredly, as it were, encompa&s;s her, do not her very Excellencies become &s;o many Incentives for ba&s;e Wretches to attempt her Virtue, and bring about her Ruin?</P>
<P>What then may not wicked Wit have to an&s;wer for, when its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors pro&s;titute it to &s;uch un|manly Purpo&s;es? And, as if they had never had a Mother, a Si&s;ter, a Daughter of their own, throw down, as much as in them lies, tho&s;e &s;acred Fences, which may lay the fair Inclo&s;ure open to the In|va&s;ions of every clum&s;ier and viler Bea&s;t of Prey, who, tho' destitute of <HI>their</HI> Wit, yet corrupted by it, &s;hall fill their Mouths, as well as their Hearts, with the borrow'd Mi&s;chief, and propagate it, from one to another, to the End of Time; and who, otherwi&s;e, would have pa&s;s'd by the uninvaded Fence, and only &s;hew'd their Teeth, and &s;narl'd at the well-&s;ecured Fold within it!</P>
<P>You cannot, my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I know you cannot, be angry at this Romantick Painting; &s;ince you are not affected by it: For when you were at wor&s;t, you acted (more dangerou&s;ly, 'tis true, for

<P>Then, dear Sir, &s;ince that noble Conver&s;ation, which you held with me at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in relation to the Con&s;equences, that might, had it not been for GOD's Grace intervening, have follow'd the Ma&s;querade Affair, I have the Plea&s;ure, the inex|pre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure, to find a thorough Reformation, from the <HI>be&s;t</HI> Motives, taking Place; and your join|ing with me in my Clo&s;et, (as Opportunity permits) in my Evening Duties, is the charming Confirma|tion of your kind, and voluntary, and, I am proud to &s;ay, your <HI>pious</HI> A&s;&s;urances! So that this makes me fearle&s;s of your Di&s;plea&s;ure, while I rather triumph in my Joy, for your precious Soul's &s;ake, than pre&s;ume to think of recriminating; and when, (only this one time for all, and for ever) I take the Liberty of looking back from the delightful <HI>Now,</HI> to the painful <HI>Formerly!</HI></P>

<P>I have, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, more Lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue my dome&s;tick Duties, which are increas'd upon me; and when I have &s;aid, That I am every Day more and more happy in my beloved Mr. <HI>B.</HI> in Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> my <HI>Billy,</HI> and my <HI>Davers,</HI> and now, newly, in my &s;weet little <HI>Pamela,</HI> (for &s;o, you know, Lady <HI>Davers</HI> would have her called, rather than by her own Name) what can I &s;ay more?</P>

<P>Lady G.

<P>If we are to do as Mr. <HI>B</HI> has it in his Thought, he intends to be out of <HI>England</HI> two Years: &mdash; But how can I bear that, if for your &s;akes only, and for tho&s;e of my dear Babies! &mdash; But this mu&s;t be my Time, my <HI>only</HI> Time, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> tells me, to ramble and &s;ee di&s;tant Places and Countries; for he is pleas'd to &s;ay, That as &s;oon as his Little-ones are capa|ble of my In&s;tructions, and begin to under&s;tand my Looks and Signs, he will not &s;pare me from them a Week together; and he is &s;o kind as to propo&s;e, that my dear bold Boy (for every one &s;ees how greatly he re&s;embles his Papa in his dear forward Spirit) &s;hall go with us; and this plea&s;es Mi&s;s <HI>Good|win</HI> highly, who is very fond of <HI>him,</HI> and my little
<PB N="390" REF="391">
<HI>Davers</HI>; but vows &s;he will never love &s;o well my little black-ey'd <HI>Pamela.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee what a &s;weet Girl Mi&s;s is, and you ad|mir'd her much: Did I tell you, what &s;he &s;aid to me, when fir&s;t &s;he &s;aw you both, with your &s;ilver Hairs, and reverend Countenances?&mdash; Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I dare &s;ay, your Papa and Mamma <HI>honoured their Father and Mother:</HI> They did, my Dear; but what is your Rea&s;on for &s;aying &s;o?&mdash; Becau&s;e, re|ply'd &s;he, <HI>they have lived &s;o long in the Land which the Lord their God has given them.</HI> I took the dear Charmer in my Arms, and ki&s;s'd her three or four times, as &s;he de&s;erv'd; for was not this very pretty in the Child?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t with inexpre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure write you Word, how happily GOD's Providence has turn'd for the be&s;t, that Affair, which once made me &s;o unea&s;y, in relation to the fine Counte&s;s, (who is gone abroad) of whom you and my Father had heard, as you told me, &s;ome Reports, which had you known at the Time, would have made you very apprehen&s;ive for Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Mo|rals, as well as for my Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>I will give you the Particulars of this dark Affair, &s;o far as &s;hall make you Judges of my pre&s;ent Joy.</P>
<P>There was but one thing wanting, my dear Pa|rents, to complete all the Happine&s;s I wi&s;h'd for in this Life; and that was the remote Hope I had en|tertain'd, that one Day, my dear Mr. <HI>.B</HI> who from a licentious Gentleman, became a Morali&s;t, would be &s;o touch'd by the Divine Grace, as to become, in time, more than a Moral, a <HI>Religious</HI> Gentleman, and that he would, at la&s;t, join in the Duties which he had the Goodne&s;s to countenance.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on I began with mere <HI>Inidi&s;pen&s;ables.</HI> I crouded not his Gate with Objects of Charity: I vi&s;ited them at their Homes, and reliev'd them; di&s;tingui&s;hing the worthy Indigent (made &s;o by un|avoidable
<PB N="391" REF="392">
Accidents and Ca&s;ualties) from the wil|fully, or perver&s;ly, or &s;otti&s;hly &s;uch, by <HI>greater</HI> Marks of my Favour.</P>
<P>I confin'd my Morning and Evening Devotions to my own Clo&s;et, as privately as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t I &s;hould give Offence and Di&s;couragement to &s;o gay a Tem|per, &s;o unaccu&s;tom'd, poor Gentleman! to Acts of Devotion and Piety; while I met his Hou&s;hold to|gether, only on Mornings and Evenings of the Sabbath-day, to prepare them for their publick Duties in the one, and in hopes to confirm them in what they had heard at Church in the other; leaving them to their own Reflections for the re&s;t of the Week; after I had &s;ugge&s;ted to them a Method I wi&s;h'd to be follow'd by them&s;elves, and in which they con&s;tantly obliged me.</P>
<P>This good Order had its de&s;ired Effect, and our Sabbath-day A&s;&s;emblies were held with &s;o little Parade, that we were hardly any of us mi&s;s'd. All, in &s;hort, was done with chearful Ea&s;e and Compo&s;ure; and every one of us was better di&s;pos'd to our dome&s;tick Duties by this Method: I to attend the good Plea&s;ure of my be&s;t Friend, and they to attend that of us both.</P>
<P>In this manner, we went on, very happily, my neighbourly Vi&s;its of Charity taking up no more Time than common Airings, and pa&s;&s;ing, many of them, for &s;uch; my <HI>private Duties</HI> being only be|tween my FIRST, my HEAVENLY BENEFACTOR, and my&s;elf, and my Family ones (per&s;onally) con|fin'd to the Day, &s;eparated for the&s;e be&s;t of Services: And Mr. <HI>B.</HI> pleas'd with my Manner, beheld the good Effects, and countenanc'd me by his Prai&s;es and his Endearments, <HI>as</HI> acting di&s;creetly, as not falling into Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and (as he u&s;ed to &s;ay) <HI>as</HI> not aiming at being <HI>righteous over-much.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;till I wanted, and I waited for, with humble Impatience, and I made it part of my con&s;tant
<PB N="392" REF="393">
Prayers, that the Divine Grace would at la&s;t touch his Heart, and make him <HI>more</HI> than a Countenancer, <HI>more</HI> than an Applauder, of my Duties: That he might, for his own dear &s;ake, become a Partaker, a Partner in them; and then, thought I, when we can Hand in Hand, Heart in Heart, one Spirit, as well as one Fle&s;h, join in the &s;ame Clo&s;et, in the &s;ame Prayers and Thank&s;givings, what an happy Creature &s;hall I be!</P>
<P>I &s;ay, <HI>Clo&s;et</HI>; for, I dur&s;t not a&s;pire &s;o high, as to hope he would favour me with his Company among his Servants, in our <HI>Sunday</HI> Devotions&mdash; I knew it would be going too far, in <HI>his</HI> Opinion, to expect it from him. In <HI>me</HI> their Mi&s;tre&s;s, had I been ever &s;o high-born, it was not ami&s;s, becau&s;e I, and they, <HI>every one</HI> of us, were <HI>his</HI>; I in one Degree, Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> in another, Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> in another&mdash;But from a Gentleman of his lordly Tem|per, and manner of Education, I knew I could never hope for it; &s;o would not lo&s;e <HI>every</HI> thing, by gra&s;p|ing at <HI>too much.</HI></P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e comfortable Pro|ceedings, and my further charming Hopes, a na&s;ty Ma&s;querade threw into the dear Gentleman's Way a Temptation, that, for a time, bla&s;ted all my Pro|&s;pects, and indeed made me doubt my own Head almo&s;t. For, judge what my Di&s;appointment mu&s;t be, when I found all my Wi&s;hes fru&s;trated, all my Prayers render'd ineffectual: His very Morality, which I had flatter'd my&s;elf, in time, I &s;hould be an humble In&s;trument to exalt into a religious Frame of Mind, &s;hock'd, and in Danger; and all the good Work to begin again, if offended Grace &s;hould ever again offer it&s;elf to the dear wilful Tre&s;pa&s;&s;er!</P>
<P>But who &s;hall pretend to &s;crutinize the Councils of the Almighty?&mdash; For out of this <HI>evil Appearance</HI> was to proceed the <HI>real Good,</HI> I had been &s;o long, and &s;o often, &s;upplicating for!</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="394">The dear Gentleman <HI>was</HI> to be on the Brink of relap&s;ing: It was proper, that I &s;hould be &s;o very unea&s;y, as to a&s;&s;ume a Conduct not natural to my Temper, and to rai&s;e his generous Concern for me: And, in the very Cri&s;is, Divine Grace interpo&s;ed, made him &s;en&s;ible of his Danger, made him re&s;olve again&s;t his Error, before it was yet too late; and his &s;liding Feet, quitting the &s;lippery Path he was in, collected new Strength, and he &s;tood the firmer, and more &s;ecure, for his Peril.</P>
<P>For, my dear Parents, having happily put an End to that Affair, he was pleas'd, when we were at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> together, and in very &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e on divine Subjects, to &s;ay to this Effect: Is there not, my <HI>Pamela,</HI> a Text, <HI>That the unbelieving Husband &s;hall be &s;aved by the believing Wife, while he beholds her cha&s;te Conver&s;ation coupled with Fear?</HI></P>
<P>I need not tell you, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that there is, nor where it is.</P>
<P>Then, my Dear, I begin to hope, that will be my Ca&s;e: For, from a late Affair, of which this Spot of Ground puts me more in mind, I &s;ee &s;o much Rea&s;on to doubt my own Strength, which I had built, and, as I thought, &s;ecurely, on <HI>moral</HI> Foundations, that I mu&s;t look out for a <HI>better</HI> Guide to conduct me, than the proud Word <HI>Honour</HI> can be, in the general Acceptation of it among us lively young Gentlemen.</P>
<P>How often, my deare&s;t Love, continued he, have I promi&s;ed, (and I never promi&s;ed, but I in|tended to perform) that I would be faithfully and only yours! How often have I declar'd, that I did not think I could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve my <HI>Pamela,</HI> till I could &s;hew her, in my own Mind, a Purity as nearly equal to hers, as my pa&s;t Conduct would admit of!</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="395">But I depended too much upon my own Strength: And I am now convinc'd, that nothing but RELIGIOUS CONSIDERATIONS, and a Re&s;olution to watch over the very <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Appear|ances of Evil, and to check them, as they ari&s;e, can be of &s;ufficient Weight to keep &s;teady to his good Purpo&s;es, a young vain Mind, <HI>too</HI> little accu&s;tom'd to Re&s;traint, and too much us'd to play upon the Brink of Dangers, from a Temerity, and Love of Intrigue, too natural to enterpri&s;ing Minds.</P>
<P>You &s;hall therefore, my <HI>Pamela,</HI> from this In|&s;tant, be my Guide; and, only taking care, that you do not all at once, by too <HI>rigorous</HI> Injunctions, damp and di&s;courage the ri&s;ing Flame, I will leave it to you to direct it as you plea&s;e, till, by degrees, it may be deem'd worthy to mingle with your own.</P>
<P>Judge, my dear Parents, how rapturous my Joy was upon this Occa&s;ion, and how ready I was to ble&s;s GOD for a Danger (&s;o narrowly e&s;cap'd) which was attended with the <HI>very</HI> Con&s;equences, that I had &s;o long pray'd for; and which I little thought the Divine Providence was bringing about by the very Means, that, I apprehended, would put an End to all my plea&s;ing Hopes and Pro&s;pects of that Nature.</P>
<P>It is in vain for me to think of finding Words to expre&s;s what I felt, and how I acted, on this Occa|&s;ion. I heard him out with twenty different and impatient Emotions; and then threw my&s;elf at his Feet, embracing his Knees, with Arms the mo&s;t ardently cla&s;ping! My Face lifted up to Heaven, and to his dear Face, by Turns, my Eyes overflowing with Tears of Joy, which half choak'd up the Pa&s;|&s;age of my Words &mdash; At la&s;t, his kind Arms cla&s;p|ing my Neck, and ki&s;&s;ing my tearful Cheek, I could only &s;ay&mdash; My Prayers, my ardent Prayers, are at la&s;t&mdash; at la&s;t&mdash; heard&mdash; May GOD Almighty, dear

<P>I wept for Joy, till I &s;obb'd again &mdash; and he rai&s;|ing me to his kind Arms, when I could &s;peak, I &s;aid, To have this <HI>heavenly</HI> Pro&s;pect, O be&s;t Beloved of my Heart! added to all my <HI>earthly</HI> Ble&s;&s;ings! &mdash; how &s;hall I contain my Joy!&mdash; For, Oh! to think that my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is, and will be, mine, and I' his, thro' the Mercies of GOD, when this tran&s;itory Life is pa&s;t and gone, to all Eternity; what a rich Thought is this!&mdash; Methinks, I am already, dear Sir, cea&s;ing to be mortal, and beginning to taste the Perfection of tho&s;e Joys, which this thrice welcome Declaration gives me Hope of, hereafter!&mdash; But, what &s;hall I &s;ay, oblig'd as I was beyond Expre&s;&s;ion before, and now doubly oblig'd in the rapturous View you have open'd to me, into an happy Fu|rurity!</P>
<P>He was pleas'd to &s;ay, He was delighted with me beyond Expre&s;&s;ion; that I was his ec&s;tatick Charmer! &mdash; That the Love I &s;hew'd for his future Good was the moving Proof of the Purity of my Heart, and my Affection for him! And that very Evening he was pleas'd to join with me in my retired Duties; and at all proper Opportunities favours me with his Company in the &s;ame manner; li&s;tening attentively to all my Le&s;&s;ons, as he calls my fond chearful Di&s;|cour&s;es on &s;erious Subjects.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Parents, do you not rejoice with me, in this charming, charming Appearance? For, <HI>before,</HI> I had the mo&s;t generous, the mo&s;t be|neficent, the mo&s;t noble, the mo&s;t affectionate; but, <HI>now,</HI> I am likely to have the mo&s;t <HI>pious</HI> of Husbands!

<P><PB N="396" REF="397">I was forc'd to leave off here, to enjoy the charm|ing Reflections, which this lovely Subject, and my ble&s;&s;ed Pro&s;pects, filled me with: And now proceed to write a few Lines more.</P>
<P>I am under &s;ome Concern on account of our going to travel into <HI>Roman-catholick</HI> Countries, for fear we &s;hould want the publick Opportuni|ties of Divine Service: For, I pre&s;ume, the Em|ba&s;&s;ador's Chapel will be the only Prote&s;tant Place of Wor&s;hip allow'd of; and <HI>Paris</HI> the only City in <HI>France</HI> where there is one. But we mu&s;t endeavour to make it up in our private and dome&s;tick Duties: For, as the Phra&s;e is, when we are at <HI>Rome,</HI> we mu&s;t do as they do at <HI>Rome</HI>; that is to &s;ay, &s;o far, as not to give Offence, on one hand, to the People we are among, nor Scandal, on the other, by Com|pliances hurtful to one's Con&s;cience. But my Pro|tector knows all the&s;e things &s;o well, (no Place in what is called the Grand Tour, being new to him) that I have no Rea&s;on to be very unea&s;y on the&s;e Accounts.</P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t dear honoured Parents, let me, by Letter, as I did on my Knees at Parting, beg the Continuance of your Prayers and Ble&s;&s;ings, and that GOD will pre&s;erve us to one another, and give us, and all our worthy Friends, a happy Meeting again.</P>
<P><HI>Kent,</HI> you may be &s;ure, will be our fir&s;t Vi&s;it, on our Return, for your &s;akes, for my dear <HI>Davers</HI>'s &s;ake, and for my little <HI>Pamela</HI>'s &s;ake, who will be both &s;ent down, and put into your Protection; while my <HI>Billy,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> (for &s;ince I began this Letter, it is &s;o determin'd) are to be my delight|ful Companions; for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> declar'd, His Boy &s;hall not be one Day out of my Pre&s;ence, if he can

help it, becau&s;e, he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, his Temper wants looking after, and his Notices of every thing are &s;trong and &s;ignificant.</P>
<P>Poor little Dear! he has indeed a little &s;ort of Perver&s;ene&s;s and Head&s;trongne&s;s, as one may &s;ay, in his Will: But he is but a Baby; and I &s;hall, I hope, manage him pretty well; for he takes great Notice of all I &s;ay, and of every Look of mine, already&mdash; He is, be&s;ides, very good-humour'd, and willing to part with any thing for a kind Word; and this gives me Hope of a docile and benevolent Di&s;po&s;ition, as he grows up.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Lady</HI> G.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your la&s;t Letter at <HI>Paris,</HI> as we were di&s;po&s;ing every thing for our Return to <HI>England,</HI> after an Ab&s;ence of near Two Years; in which, as I have inform'd you, from time to time, I have been a great Traveller, into <HI>Holland,</HI> the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> through the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Provinces of <HI>France,</HI> into <HI>Italy</HI>; and, in our Return to <HI>Paris</HI> again, (the principal Place of our Re&s;idence) through &s;everal Parts of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>I told you of the Favours and Civilities we re|ceiv'd at <HI>Florence,</HI> from the then Counte&s;s Dowager of &mdash; who, with her Humble Servant Lord <HI>C.</HI>&mdash; (that had &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attended her for &s;o many Months in <HI>Italy</HI>) accompany'd us from <HI>Florence</HI> to <HI>In&s;pruck.</HI></P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip made that worthy Lord happy in about a Month after &s;he parted from us; and the noble Pair gave us an Opportunity at <HI>Paris,</HI> in their Way to <HI>England,</HI> to return &s;ome of the Civilities, which we receiv'd from them in <HI>Italy:</HI> And they are now arriv'd at her Lady&s;hip's Seat on the Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Her Lord is exceedingly fond of her&punc; as he well may; for &s;he is one of the mo&s;t charming Ladies in <HI>England</HI>; and behaves to him with &s;o much Pru|dence and Re&s;pect, that they are as happy in each other, as can be wi&s;h'd. And let me ju&s;t add, That both in <HI>Italy</HI> and at <HI>Paris,</HI> Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Demeanour and her Lady&s;hip's to one another, was &s;o nobly open, and unaffectedly polite, as well as highly di&s;|creet, that neither Lord <HI>C.</HI> who had once been jealous of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> nor the <HI>other Party,</HI> who had
<PB N="399" REF="400">
had a Tincture of the &s;ame Yellow Evil, as you know, becau&s;e of the Counte&s;s, had &s;o much as a Shadow of Unea&s;ine&s;s remaining on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Davers</HI> has had his Health (which had be|gun to decline in <HI>England</HI>) &s;o well, that there was no per&s;uading Lady <HI>Davers</HI> to return before now; altho' I begg'd and pray'd I might not have another little <HI>Frenchman,</HI> for fear they &s;hould, as they grew up, forget, as I plea&s;antly u&s;ed to &s;ay, the Obli|gations which their Parentage lays them under to dearer <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t Friend, I have &s;hut up my Rambles for my whole Life; for Three little <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Folks, and One little <HI>Frenchman,</HI> (but a charming Baby, as well as the re&s;t, <HI>Charley</HI> by Name) and a near Pro&s;pect of a further Increa&s;e, you will &s;ay, are Family enough to employ all my Cares at home.</P>
<P>I have told you, from time to time, altho' I could not write to you &s;o often as I would, becau&s;e of our being &s;o con&s;tantly in Motion, what was mo&s;t worthy of your Knowlege relating to our Particular, and how happy we have all been in one another. And I have the Plea&s;ure to confirm to you what I have &s;everal times written, that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and my Lord and Lady <HI>Davers</HI> are all that I could wi&s;h and hope for, with regard to their fir&s;t Duties. Indeed, in|deed, we are an happy Family, united by the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olid Motives!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI> is a charming young Lady!&mdash; I cannot expre&s;s how much I love her. She is a per|fect Mi&s;tre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> Language, and &s;peaks <HI>Italian</HI> very prettily: And, as to my&s;elf, I have im|proved &s;o well under my dear Tutor's Le&s;&s;ons, to|gether with the Opportunity of conver&s;ing with the polite&s;t and mo&s;t learned Gentry of different Na|tions, that I will hold a Conver&s;ation with you in
<PB N="400" REF="401">
two or three Languages, if you plea&s;e, when I have the Happine&s;s to &s;ee you. There's a learned Boa&s;ter for you, my dear Friend! (if the Knowlege of dif|ferent Languages makes one learned). But I &s;hall bring you an Heart as intirely <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as ever, for all that!</P>
<P>We landed on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> la&s;t at <HI>Dover,</HI> and di|rected our Cour&s;e to the dear Farm-hou&s;e; and you can better imagine, than I expre&s;s, what a Meet|ing we had with my dear Father and Mother, and my beloved <HI>Davers</HI> and <HI>Pamela,</HI> who are charming Babies &mdash; But is not this the Language of every fond Mamma?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI> is highly delighted now with my &s;weet little <HI>Pamela,</HI> and &s;ays, She &s;hall be her Si&s;ter indeed! For, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, Mi&s;s is a Beauty!&mdash;And we &s;ee no <HI>French</HI> Beauties like Ma&s;ter <HI>Davers</HI> and Mi&s;s.</P>
<P>Beauty! my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> &s;aid I; what is Beauty, if &s;he be not a good Girl?&mdash; Beauty is but a &s;pecious, and, as it may happen, a dangerous Re|commendation, a mere skin-deep Perfection; and if, as &s;he grows up, &s;he is not as good as my Mi&s;s <HI>Good|win,</HI> &s;he &s;hall be none of my Girl.</P>
<P>What adds to my Plea&s;ure, my dear Friend, is to &s;ee them both &s;o well got over the Small-pox. It has been as happy for them, as it was for their Mamma and her <HI>Billy,</HI> that they had it under &s;o skilful and kind a Manager in that Di&s;temper, as my dear Mother. I wi&s;h, if it plea&s;e GOD, it was as happily over with my little pretty <HI>Frenchman.</HI></P>
<P>Every body is &s;urpris'd to &s;ee what the pa&s;t two Years have done for Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and my <HI>Billy.</HI> &mdash; O my dear Friend, they are both of them almo&s;t&mdash;nay, quite, I think, for their Years, all that I wi&s;h them to be.</P>
<P>In order to make them keep their <HI>French,</HI> which Mi&s;s &s;o well &s;peaks, and <HI>Billy</HI> &s;o prettily prattles, I make them, when they talk to one another, and
<PB N="401" REF="402">
are in the Nur&s;ery, &s;peak nothing el&s;e: But at Table, except on particular Occa&s;ions, when <HI>French</HI> may be &s;poken, they are to &s;peak in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; that is to &s;ay, when they <HI>do</HI> &s;peak: For I tell them, that little Ma&s;ters mu&s;t do nothing but ask Que&s;tions for In|formation, and &s;ay Yes, or No, till their Papa's or Mamma's give them Leave to &s;peak; nor little Ladies neither, till they are Sixteen: for, my dear Loves, cry I, You would not &s;peak before you know <HI>how:</HI> And Knowlege is obtain'd by <HI>Hearing,</HI> and not by <HI>Speaking:</HI> And &s;etting my <HI>Billy</HI> on my Lap, in Mi&s;s's Pre&s;ence, Here, &s;aid I, taking an Ear in the Fingers of each Hand, are two Ears, my <HI>Billy</HI>; and, then pointing to his Mouth, but one Tongue, my Love: So you mu&s;t be &s;ure to mind, that you <HI>hear</HI> twice as much as you <HI>&s;peak,</HI> even when you grow a bigger Ma&s;ter than you are now.</P>
<P>You have &s;o many pretty Ways to learn one, Madam, &s;ays Mi&s;s, now-and-then, it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould not regard what you &s;ay to us!</P>
<P>Several <HI>French</HI> Tutors, when we were abroad, were recommended to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> But there is one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, now on his Travels with young Mr. <HI>R.</HI> with whom Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has agreed; and in the mean time, my be&s;t Friend is pleas'd to compliment me, that the Children will not &s;uffer for want of a Tutor, while I can take the Pains I do: Which he will have to be too much for me; e&s;pecially, that now, on our Return, my <HI>Davers</HI> and my <HI>Pamela</HI> are added to my Cares. But what Mother can take too much Pains to cultivate the Minds of her Children?&mdash; If, my dear Lady <HI>G.</HI> it were not for the&s;e <HI>frequent</HI> Lyings-in!&mdash; But this is the Time of Life&mdash; Tho' little did I think, &s;o early, I &s;hould have &s;o many careful Ble&s;&s;ings!</P>
<P>I have as great Credit as Plea&s;ure from my little Family. All our Neighbours here in <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI>
<PB N="402" REF="403">
admire us more and more. You'll excu&s;e my &s;eem|ing (for it is but &s;eeming) Vanity; I hope I know better than to have it real&mdash;Never, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> who is &s;till a &s;ingle Lady, did I &s;ee, before, a Lady &s;o much advantag'd by her Re&s;idence in that fan|ta&s;tick Nation, (for &s;he loves not the <HI>French</HI>) and who brought home with her nothing of their Affect|ations!&mdash; She will have it, that the <HI>French</HI> Polite|ne&s;s, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frankne&s;s and Plainne&s;s of Heart, appear happily blended in all we &s;ay and do. And &s;he makes me a thou&s;and Compliments upon Lord and Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s Account, who, &s;he would fain per&s;uade me, owe a great deal of Improvement, (my Lord in his Conver&s;ation, and my Lady in her Temper) to living in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with us.</P>
<P>Indeed my Lady <HI>Davers</HI> is exceeding kind and good to me, is always magnifying me to every body, and &s;ays, &s;he knows not how to live from me; and that I have been a Means of &s;aving half an hundred Souls, as well as her dear Brother's. On an Indi&s;|po&s;ition of my Lord's at <HI>Montpelier,</HI> which made her Lady&s;hip very apprehen&s;ive, &s;he declar'd, that were &s;he to be depriv'd of his Lord&s;hip, &s;he would not let us re&s;t, till we had con&s;ented to permit her to live with us; &s;aying, that we had Room enough in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and &s;he would inlarge the <HI>Bedford|&s;hire</HI> Seat at her own Expence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H.</HI> is Mr. <HI>H.</HI> still; and that's the be&s;t I can &s;ay of him: For, I verily think, he is more an Ape than ever. His <HI>whole</HI> Head is now <HI>French.</HI> 'Twas <HI>half</HI> &s;o before. We had great Difficulties with him abroad: His Aunt and I endeavouring to give him a &s;erious and religious Turn, we had like to have turn'd him into a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick. For he was plea&s;ed much with the &s;hewy Part of that Religion, and the fine Pictures and Decorations in the Churches of <HI>Italy</HI>; and having got into Company with a <HI>Domi|nican</HI>
<PB N="403" REF="404">
at <HI>Padua,</HI> a <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> at <HI>Milan,</HI> and a <HI>Jesuit</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> they lay &s;o hard at him, in their Turns, that we had like to have lo&s;t him to each A&s;&s;ailant; &s;o were forced to let him take his own Cour&s;e; for, his Aunt would have it, that he had no other De|fence from the Attacks of Per&s;ons to make him embrace a faulty Religion, than to permit him to continue as he was; that is to &s;ay, to have none at all. So &s;he &s;u&s;pended attempting to pro&s;elyte the thoughtle&s;s Creature, till he came to <HI>England.</HI> I wi&s;h her Lady&s;hip Succe&s;s here; but, I doubt, he will not be a Credit to any Religion, for a great while. And as he is very de&s;irous to go to <HI>London,</HI> as he has always been, it will be found, when there, that any fluttering Coxcomb will do more to make him one of that Cla&s;s, in an Hour, than his Aunt's Le&s;&s;ons, to make him a good Man, in a Twelve|month. <HI>Where much is given, much is required.</HI> The contrary of this, I doubt, is all poor Mr. <HI>H.</HI> has to tru&s;t to.</P>
<P>Just now we have a Me&s;&s;enger to tell us, that his Father, who has been long ill, is dead. So, now, he is a Lord indeed! He flutters and &s;truts about mo&s;t &s;trangely, I warrant, and is wholly imploy'd in giving Directions relating to his Mourning Equi|page &mdash; And now there will be no holding of him in, I doubt; except his new Title has &s;o much Vir|tue in it, as to make him a wi&s;er and a better Man.</P>
<P>He will now have a Seat in the Hou&s;e of Peers of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; but I hope, for the Nation's &s;ake, he will not meet with many more like him&s;elf there! &mdash; For, to me, that is one of the mo&s;t venerable A&s;&s;emblies in the World; and it appears the more &s;o, &s;ince I have been abroad; for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gen|tleman is re&s;pected, if he be any thing of a Man, above a foreign Nobleman; and an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Noble|man, above &s;ome petty Sovereigns.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="405">If our travelling Gentry duly con&s;ider'd this Di|&s;tinction in their Favour, they would, for the Ho|nour of their Country, as well as for their own Credit, behave in a better manner, in their foreign Tours, than, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, &s;ome of them do. But what can one expect, from the unlick'd Cubs, par|don the Term, &s;ent abroad with only Stature, to make them look like Men, and Equipage to attract Re&s;pect, without one other Qualification to inforce it?</P>
<P>Here let me clo&s;e this, with a few Tears, to the Memory of my dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> my other Mother, my Friend, my Advi&s;er, my Protectre&s;s, in my &s;ingle State, and my faithful Second and Partaker in the Comforts of my higher Life, and better Fortunes!</P>
<P>What would I have given to have been pre&s;ent, as, it &s;eems, &s;he &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;hed, to clo&s;e her dying Eyes! I &s;hould have done it, with the Piety and the Concern of a truly affectionate Daughter. But that melancholy Happine&s;s was deny'd to us both; for, as I told you in the Letter on the Occa|&s;ion, the dear good Woman (who now is in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her ble&s;&s;ed Reward, and is rejoicing in God's Mercies) was no more, when the News reached me, &s;o far off, as at <HI>Heidelburgh,</HI> of her la&s;t Illne&s;s and Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear, every time I enter her Parlour, (where I u&s;ed to &s;ee, with &s;o much Delight, the good Woman &s;itting, always imploy'd in &s;ome u&s;e|ful or pious Work) &s;hedding a Tear to her Memory: And in my Sabbath Duties, mi&s;&s;ing <HI>her,</HI> I mi&s;s half a dozen Friends, methinks; and I &s;igh in Remem|brance of her; and can only recover that chearful Frame, which the Performance of tho&s;e Duties always gave me, by reflecting, that &s;he now is reaping the Reward of that &s;incere Piety, which us'd to edify and encourage us all.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="406">The Servants we brought home with us, and tho&s;e we left behind us, met in Tears at the Name of Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI> Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> lamented too, in the mo&s;t moving Strain, her Lo&s;s: And all I can do now, in Honour of her Memory and her Merit, is to be a Friend to tho&s;e &s;he lov'd mo&s;t, as I have already begun to be; and none of them &s;hall &s;uffer in tho&s;e Concerns that can be an&s;wer'd, now &s;he is gone.

Jonathan</HI> was not a common Servant; neither are <HI>any</HI> of ours &s;o: But <HI>Jonathan</HI> excell'd all that excell'd in his Cla&s;s! &mdash; I am told, That the&s;e two worthy Folks dy'd within two Days of one another; a Circum&s;tance you mention'd not in your Letter to me; on which Occa&s;ion I could not help &s;aying to my&s;elf, in the Words of <HI>David</HI> over <HI>Saul</HI> and his Son <HI>Jonathan,</HI> the Name&s;ake of our worthy Butler, <HI>They were lovely and plea&s;ant in their Lives, and in their Deaths they were not divided.</HI></P>
<P>I might have continu'd on in the Words of the Royal Lamenter; for, &s;urely, never did one Fellow-servant love another in my Maiden State, nor Ser|vant love a Mi&s;tre&s;s in my exalted Condition, better than <HI>Jonathan</HI> lov'd me! I could &s;ee in his Eyes a gli&s;tening Plea&s;ure, whenever I pa&s;s'd by him: If at &s;uch times I &s;poke to him, as I &s;eldom fail'd to do,

<P>YOU will excu&s;e my long Silence, when you are <HI>reminded</HI> of the Occa&s;ions to which it has been owing; for &s;ome of them you know; and when you are <HI>told</HI> the others.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, I was oblig'd to pay a dutiful and concerning Vi&s;it to <HI>Kent,</HI> where my good Father was taken ill of a Fever, and my Mother of an Ague: And think, Madam, how this mu&s;t affect me, from their Time of Life! &mdash; O Death!

<P>I had hardly return'd from <HI>Kent</HI> to <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> and look'd round, when I was oblig'd to &s;et out to attend Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> who &s;ent me word, that &s;he &s;hould <HI>die,</HI> that was her &s;trong Term, if &s;he &s;aw me not, to comfort and recover, by my Coun|&s;el and Pre&s;ence, &s;o &s;she was pleas'd to expre&s;s her|&s;elf, her &s;ick Lord, who was ju&s;t got out of an in|termittent Fever, which left him without any Spirits, and was occa&s;ion'd by fretting at the Conduct of her <HI>&s;tupid Nephew,</HI> tho&s;e al&s;o were her Words.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Lady</HI> G.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Remarks which, your Cou&s;in <HI>Fielding</HI> tells you, I have made on the Subject of young Gentlemens Travelling, and which you reque&s;t me to communicate to you, are Part of a little Book upon Education, which I wrote for Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Cor|rection and Amendment, on occa&s;ion of his putting Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Treati&s;e on that Subject into my Hands, and requiring my Ob&s;ervations upon it.</P>
<P>I cannot flatter my&s;elf, that they will an&s;wer your Expectation; for I am &s;en&s;ible they mu&s;t be unwor|thy even of the Opportunities I have had in the Excur&s;ions, in which I have been indulg'd by the be&s;t of Gentlemen.</P>
<P>But your Reque&s;ts are &s;o many Laws to me; and I will give you a &s;hort Ab&s;tract of what I read to Mi&s;s <HI>Fielding,</HI> who has &s;o greatly over-rated it to you.</P>
<P>That Gentleman's Book contains many excellent Rules on the Subject of Education: But this of Travel I will only refer you to at pre&s;ent. You will there &s;ee his Objections again&s;t the Age at which young Gentlemen are &s;ent abroad, from Sixteen to Twenty-one, the Time in all their Lives, he &s;ays, in which young Men are the lea&s;t &s;uited to the&s;e Improvements, and in which they have the lea&s;t Fence and Guard again&s;t their Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="414">The Age he propo&s;es is from Seven to Fourteen, becau&s;e of the Advantage they will then have to ma&s;ter Foreign Languages, and to form the Tongue to their true Accents, as well as that then they will be ea&s;ier directed by their Tutors or Governors. Or el&s;e he propo&s;es that more &s;edate Time of Life, when the Gentleman is able to travel without a Tutor, and to make his own Ob&s;ervations; and when he is thoroughly acquainted with the Laws and Fa&s;hions, the natural and moral Advantages and Defects of his own Country; by which means, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> wi&s;ely ob&s;erves, the Traveller will have &s;omething to ex|change with tho&s;e abroad, from who&s;e Conver&s;ation he hopes to reap any Knowlege. This Gentleman &s;upports his Opinion by excellent Rea&s;ons, to which I refer you.</P>
<P>What I have written in my little Book, which I have not yet quite fini&s;h'd, on <HI>this</HI> Head, relates principally to <HI>Home Travelling,</HI> which Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was always re&s;olv'd his Sons &s;hould undertake, before they enter'd upon a Foreign Tour. I have there ob&s;erv'd, That <HI>England</HI> abounds with Curio&s;ities, both of Art and Nature, worth the Notice of a diligent Inquirer, and equal with &s;ome of tho&s;e we admire in Foreign Parts; and that if the Youth be not &s;ent abroad at Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s earlie&s;t Time, from Seven to Fourteen, (which I can hardly think will be worth while, merely for the &s;ake of attaining a Per|fection in the Languages) he may with good Advan|tage begin, at Fourteen or Fifteen, the Tour of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> now-and-then by Excur&s;ions in the Summer Months, between his other Studies, and as a Diver|&s;ion to him.</P>
<P>This I &s;hould wi&s;h might be enter'd upon in his Papa's Company, as well as his Tutor's, if it could conveniently be done; who thus initiating both the Governed and the Governor in the Methods he
<PB N="414" REF="415">
would have ob&s;erv'd by both, will obtain no &s;mall Satisfaction and Amu&s;ement to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>For the Father would by this means be an Eye|witne&s;s of the Behaviour of the one and the other, and have a Specimen, how fit the young Man was to be tru&s;ted, or the Tutor to be depended upon, when <HI>they</HI> went abroad, and were out of his Sight; as <HI>they</HI> would of what was expected from them by the Father. And hence a thou&s;and Benefits, as I humbly conceive, would ari&s;e to the young Gentle|man from the Ob&s;ervations and Reflections he would receive from his Father, as Occa&s;ion offer'd, with regard to Expence, Company, Conver&s;ation, Hours, and &s;uch-like.</P>
<P>If the Father could not him&s;elf accompany his Son, he might appoint the Stages the young Gentle|man &s;hould take, and injoin both Tutor and Son to give, at every Stage, an Account of whatever they ob&s;erved curious and remarkable, not omitting the minute&s;t Occurrences, travelling Expences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By this means, and the Probability, that he might hear of them, and their Proceedings, from his Friends, Acquaintance, and Relations, who might fall in with them, or at who&s;e Seats they might &s;ometimes be entertained, they would know the In&s;pection they were under, and have a greater Regard to their Conduct.</P>
<P>By &s;eeing thus the different Cu&s;toms, Manners, and Oeconomy of different Per&s;ons and Families, (for in &s;o mix'd a Nation as ours is, there is as great a Variety of that &s;ort to be met with, as in mo&s;t) and from their different Treatment at their &s;everal Stages, a great deal of the World may be learn'd by the young Gentleman. He would be prepar'd to go abroad with more Delight to him&s;elf, as well as more Experience, and greater Reputation to his Family and Country. In &s;uch Excur&s;ions as the&s;e,
<PB N="415" REF="416">
the Tutor would &s;ee the Temper and Inclination of the young Gentleman, and might give proper Notices to the Father, if any thing was ami&s;s, that it might be &s;et right, while the Youth was yet in his Reach, and more under his In&s;pection, than he would be in a foreign Country: And the Ob&s;ervations the young Gentleman would make at his Return, as well as in his Letters&punc; would &s;hew how fit he was to be tru&s;ted, and how likely to improve, when at a greater Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>After <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> as well the inland Parts, as the Sea-coa&s;ts, let them, if they behave according to Expectation, take a Journey into <HI>Scot|land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and vi&s;it the principal I&s;lands, as <HI>Guern&s;ey, Jer&s;ey,</HI> &amp;c. the young Gentleman conti|nuing to write down his Ob&s;ervations all the way, and keeping a Journal of Occurrences: And let him imploy the little Time he will be on board of Ship in the&s;e &s;mall Trips from I&s;land to I&s;land, or Coa&s;t|wi&s;e, in ob&s;erving upon the noble Art of Naviga|tion, of the Theory of which, it will not be ami&s;s, that he has &s;ome Notion, as well as of the curi|ous Structure of a Ship, its Tackle, and Furniture: A Knowlege very far from being in&s;ignificant to a Gentleman who is an I&s;lander, and has a Stake in the greate&s;t maritime Kingdom in the World; and hence he will be taught to love and value that mo&s;t u&s;eful and brave Set of Men, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sailors, who are the natural Defence and Glory of the Realm.</P>
<P>Hereby he will confirm his Theory of the Geo|graphy of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions in <HI>Europe:</HI> He will be appris'd of the Situation, Conveniencies, Intere&s;ts and Con&s;titution of his own Country; and will be able to lay a Ground-work for the future Government of his Thoughts and Actions, if the Intere&s;t he bears in his native Country &s;hould call
<PB N="416" REF="417">
him to the publick Service in either Hou&s;e of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>With this Foundation, how excellently would he be qualify'd to go abroad? and how properly then would he add to the Knowlege he had attain'd of his own Country, that of the different Cu&s;toms, Manners, and Forms of Government of others? How would he be able to form Compari&s;ons, and to make all his Inquiries appear pertinent and manly? All the Occa&s;ions of that ignorant Wonder, which renders a Novice the Je&s;t of all about him, would be taken away. He would be able to ask Que&s;tions, and to judge without Leading-&s;trings. Nor would he think he has &s;een a Country, and an&s;wer'd the Ends of his Father's Expence, and his own Improve|ment, by running thro' a Kingdom, and knowing nothing of it, but the Inns and Stages, at which he &s;topp'd to eat and drink. For, on the contrary, he would make the be&s;t Acquaintance, and contract worthy Friend&s;hips with &s;uch as would court and reverence him as one of the ri&s;ing Genius's of his Country.</P>
<P>Whereas mo&s;t of the young Gentlemen, who are &s;ent abroad raw and unprepar'd, as if to wonder at every thing they &s;ee, and to be laugh'd at by all that &s;ee them, do but expo&s;e them&s;elves, and their Country. And if at their Return, by Intere&s;t of Friends, by Alliances or Marriages, they &s;hall hap|pen to be promoted to Places of Honour or Profit, their unmerited Preferment will only &s;erve to make tho&s;e Foreigners, who were Eye-witne&s;&s;es of their Weakne&s;s and Follies, when among them, conclude greatly in Disfavour of the whole Nation, or, at lea&s;t, of the Prince, and his Admini&s;tration, who could find no fitter Subjects to di&s;tingui&s;h.</P>
<P>This, my dear Friend, is a brief Extract from my Ob&s;ervations on the Head of qualifying young Gentlemen to travel with Honour and Improve|ment.
<PB N="417" REF="418">
I doubt you'll be apt to think me not a little out of my Element; but &s;ince you <HI>would</HI> have it, I claim the Allowances of a Friend; to which my ready Compliance with your Commands the rather intitles me.</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Murray</HI> are &s;o unhappy in each other. Were he a generous Man, the heavy Lo&s;s the poor Lady has &s;u&s;tained, as well as her Si&s;ter, my beloved Friend, in &s;o excellent a Mother, and &s;o kind a Father, would make him bear with her Infirmities a little.</P>
<P>But, really, I have &s;een on Twenty Occa&s;ions, that, notwith&s;tanding all the fine Things Gentlemen &s;ay to Ladies before Marriage, if the latter do not <HI>improve</HI> upon their Husbands Hands, their imputed Graces, when &s;ingle, will not protect them from Indifference, and, probably, from wor&s;e: While the Gentleman, perhaps, thinks <HI>he</HI> only, of the Two, is intitled to go backward in Acts of Kind|ne&s;s and Complai&s;ance. A &s;trange and a &s;hocking Difference, which too many Ladies experience, who, from fond Lovers, pro&s;trate at their Feet, find &s;urly Husbands, trampling upon their Necks!</P>
<P>You, my dear Friend, were happy in your Days of Court&s;hip, and are no le&s;s &s;o in your State of Wedlock. And may you continue to be &s;o to a good old Age, prays</P>

<P>THE Papers you have mi&s;laid, relating to the Conver&s;ation between me and the young Ladies, Relations of Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> and Lady <HI>Arthur,</HI> in Pre&s;ence of the&s;e two la&s;t-nam'd Ladies, Mrs. <HI>Brooks,</HI> and the worthy Dean, and Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> (of which, in order to perfect your kind Collection of my Com|munications, you reque&s;t another Copy) contained as follows:</P>
<P>I fir&s;t began with appri&s;ing you, that I had &s;een the&s;e three Ladies, twice or thrice before, as Vi&s;itors, at their Kin&s;womens Hou&s;es; &s;o that they and I were not altogether Strangers to one another: And my two Neighbours acquainted me with their re&s;pective Ta&s;tes and Di&s;po&s;itions, and gave me their Hi&s;tories, pre|parative to this Vi&s;it, to the following Effect:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That Mi&s;s STAPYLTON is over-run with the Love of Poetry and Romance, and delights much in flowery Language, and metaphorical Flouri&s;hes: Is about Eighteen, wants not either Sen&s;e or Po|litene&s;s; and has read her&s;elf into a Vein, that is more amorous (that was Lady <HI>Towers</HI>'s Word) than di&s;creet. Has extraordinary Notions of a <HI>Fir&s;t-&s;ight</HI> Love; and gives her&s;elf greater Liber|ties, with a Pair of fine Eyes, (in hopes to make &s;udden Conque&s;ts in pur&s;uance of that Notion) than is pretty in her Sex and Age; which makes tho&s;e who know her not, conclude her bold and forward; and is more than &s;u&s;pected, with a Mind thus prepared for in&s;tantaneous Impre&s;&s;ions, to have experienc'd the Argument to her own Di&s;advan|tage, and to be <HI>&s;truck</HI> (before &s;he has <HI>&s;tricken</HI>) by a Gentleman, whom her Friends think not at all worthy of her, and to whom &s;he was making &s;ome indi&s;creet Advances, under the Name of PHILO|CLEA to PHILOXENUS, in a Letter which &s;he in|tru&s;ted
<PB N="420" REF="421">
to a Servant of the Family, who, di&s;co|vering her De&s;ign, prevented her Indi&s;cretion for that Time.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That, in other re&s;pects, &s;he has no mean Ac|compli&s;hments, will have a fine Fortune, is gen|teel in her Per&s;on, tho' with &s;ome vi&s;ible Affecta|tion, dances well, &s;ings well, and plays prettily on &s;everal In&s;truments; is fond of Reading, but affects the Action, and Air, and Attitude, of a Tragedian; and is too apt to give an Empha&s;is in the wrong Place, in order to make an Author mean more &s;ignificantly than it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould, even where the Occa&s;ion is common, and in a mere hi&s;torical Fact, that requires as much Simplicity in the Reader's Accent, as in the Writer's Style: No Wonder then, that when &s;he reads a Play, &s;he will put her&s;elf into a Sweat, as Lady <HI>Towers</HI> &s;ays; di&s;torting very agreeable Features, and making a <HI>Multitude</HI> of wry Mouths, with <HI>one</HI> very pretty one, in order to convince her Hearers, what a near Neighbour her Heart is to her Lips.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Mi&s;s COPE is a young Lady of Nineteen, lovely in her Per&s;on, with a hand&s;ome Fortune in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and great Pro&s;pects. Has a &s;oft and gen|tle Turn of Mind, which di&s;po&s;es her to be ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon. Is addre&s;s'd by a Libertine of Quality, who&s;e Court&s;hip, while permitted, was Imperiou&s;ne&s;s; and Tenderne&s;s, In&s;ult; having found the young Lady too &s;u&s;ceptible of Impre&s;&s;ion, open and unre&s;erv'd, and even valuing him the more, as it &s;eem'd, for treating her with ungenerous Con|tempt; for that &s;he was always making Excu&s;es for Slights, Ill-manners, and even Rudene&s;s, which no other young Lady would forgive.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That this Facility on her Side, and this In&s;olence on his, and an over-free, and even indecent De|gree of Ramping, as it is called, with Mi&s;s, which
<PB N="421" REF="422">
once her Mamma &s;urpris'd them in, made her Papa forbid <HI>his</HI> Vi&s;its, and <HI>her</HI> receiving them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That this, however, was &s;o much to Mi&s;s's Regret, that &s;he was detected in a De&s;ign to elope to him out of the private Garden-door, where, in all Probability, the indelicate and di&s;honourable Peer would have triumphed over her Innocence; having given out &s;ince, that he intended to revenge him&s;elf on the Daughter, for the Di&s;grace he had received from the Parents.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That tho' &s;he was convinc'd of this, 'twas fear'd &s;he &s;till lov'd him, and would throw her&s;elf in his way the fir&s;t convenient Opportunity; urging, that his ra&s;h Expre&s;&s;ions were the Effect only of his Pa&s;&s;ion; for that &s;he knows he loves her too well, to be di&s;honourable to her: And, by the &s;ame Degree of favourable Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he will have it, That his brutal Roughne&s;s, is the Manline&s;s of his Nature; That his mo&s;t &s;hocking Expre&s;&s;ions, are Sincerity of Heart; That his Boa&s;ts of his former Lewdne&s;s, are but In&s;tances that he knows the World; That his Freedoms with her Per&s;on, are but Exce&s;s of Love, and innocent Gaiety of Temper; That his re&s;enting the Prohibition he has met with, and his Threats, are other In&s;tances of his Love and his Courage: And Peers of the Realm ought not to be bound down by little narrow Rules, like the Vulgar; for, truly, their <HI>Honour,</HI> which is regarded in the greate&s;t Ca&s;es, equal with the <HI>Oath</HI> of a common Gentleman, is a Security that a <HI>Lady</HI> may tru&s;t to, if he is not a Profligate indeed; and that Lord <HI>P. cannot</HI> be.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That excepting the&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es, Mi&s;s has many good Qualities; is charitable, pious, humane, hum|ble; &s;ings &s;weetly, plays on the Spinnet charmingly; is meek, fearful, and never was re&s;olute or cou|rageous enough to &s;tep out of the regular Path,
<PB N="422" REF="423">
till her too flexible Heart became touch'd with a Pa&s;&s;ion, that is &s;aid to tame Lions, and therefore her rough Peer has none of it; and animate the Dove, and Mi&s;s <HI>Cope</HI> has too much of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That Mi&s;s SUTTON, a young Lady of the like Age with the two former, has too lively and airy a Turn of Mind; affects to be thought well read in the Hi&s;tories of Kingdoms, as well as in polite Literature. Speaks <HI>French</HI> fluently, talks upon all Subjects much; and has a great deal of that flip|pant Wit, which makes more Enemies than Friends. However is innocent, and un&s;u&s;pectedly virtuous hitherto; but makes her&s;elf cheap and acce&s;&s;ible to Fops and Rakes, and has not the wor&s;e Opi|nion of a Man for being &s;uch. Li&s;tens eagerly to Stories told to the Di&s;advantage of Individuals of her own Sex; tho' affecting to be a great Stickler for the Honour of the Sex in general: Will unpity|ingly propagate &s;uch Stories: Thinks (without con|&s;idering to what the Imprudence of her own Con|duct may &s;ubject her) the Woman, that &s;lips, inex|cu&s;able: A&s;&s;erts, that it is the <HI>Man's</HI> Place <HI>to ask,</HI> the <HI>Woman's to deny</HI>; and by this means encou|rages the one in their vile Attempts, and gives up the other for their Weakne&s;s, in a kind of &s;illy Affectation, to &s;hew her Security in her own Vir|tue; at the very time, that &s;he is dancing upon the Edge of a Precipice, pre&s;umptuou&s;ly inat|tentive to her own Danger.'</Q></P>
<P>The worthy Dean, knowing the Ladies Inten|tion in this Vi&s;it to me, brought his Daughter with him, as if by Accident: For Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> with many good Qualities, is of a remarkably &s;oft Temper, tho' not &s;o incon&s;iderately &s;oft as Mi&s;s <HI>Cope:</HI> But is too credulous; and, as her Papa &s;u&s;pects, entertains more than a Liking to a wild young Gentleman, the
<PB N="423" REF="424">
Heir to a noble Fortune, who makes Vi&s;its to her, full of Tenderne&s;s and Re&s;pect, but without declare|ing him&s;elf. This gives the Dean a good deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s, and he is very de&s;irous, that Mi&s;s &s;hould be in my Company on all Occa&s;ions; as &s;he is &s;o kind to profe&s;s a great Regard to my Opinion and Judgment.</P>
<P>'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee the poor young Lady is in Love; and &s;he makes no doubt, that the young Gentleman loves <HI>her:</HI> But, alas! why then (for he is not a ba&s;hful Man, as you &s;hall hear) does he not &s;ay &s;o?&mdash;He has deceived already two young Creatures. His Father has caution'd the Dean again&s;t his Son. Has told him, that he is &s;ly, &s;ubtle, full of Strata|gem; yet has &s;o much Command of him&s;elf, (which makes him more dangerous) as not to precipitate his De&s;igns; but can wait with Patience, till he thinks him&s;elf &s;ecure of his Prey, and then pulls off the Mask at once; and, if he &s;ucceeds, glories in his Villainy.</P>
<P>Yet does the Father beg of the Dean to permit his Vi&s;its; for he would be glad he would marry Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> tho' greatly unequal in Fortune to his Son; wi&s;hing for nothing &s;o much, as that he <HI>would</HI> marry. And the Dean, owing his principal Prefer|ment to the old Gentleman, cares not to di&s;oblige him, or affront his Son, without &s;ome apparent Rea&s;on for the latter; e&s;pecially as the Father is bound up in him, all the Family Hopes depending upon him, having no other Child, and being him&s;elf half afraid of him, le&s;t, if too much thwarted, he &s;hould fly out intirely.</P>
<P>So here, Madam, are Four young Ladies of like Years, and different Inclinations and Tempers, all of whom may be &s;aid to have Dangers to encounter with, re&s;ulting from their re&s;pective Di&s;po&s;itions: And who, profe&s;&s;ing to admire my Character, and
<PB N="424" REF="425">
the Example I had &s;et, were brought to me, to be benefited, as Lady <HI>Towers</HI> was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, by my Conver&s;ation: And all was to be as if accidental, none of them knowing how well I was acquainted with their re&s;pective Characters.</P>
<P>How proud, my dear Lady G. would this Com|pliment have made me, from &s;uch a Lady as Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> had I not been as proud as proud could be before, in the good Opinion of four beloved Per|&s;ons, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> the Counte&s;s of <HI>C.</HI> and your dear Self!</P>
<P>We were attended only by <HI>Polly Barlow,</HI> who was as much concern'd as any body in &s;ome of the Points, that came before us. And as you know this was in the Time of the Vi&s;it paid us by Lord and Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> and that noble Counte&s;s, 'tis proper to &s;ay, they were abroad together upon a Vi&s;it, from which, knowing how I was to be engag'd, they excus'd me.</P>
<P>The Dean was well known to, and valu'd by, all the Ladies; and therefore was no manner of Re|&s;traint upon the Freedom of our Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I was above in my Clo&s;et when they came; and Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> having pre&s;ented each young Lady to me when I came down, &s;aid, being all &s;eated, I can gue&s;s at your Imployment, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;Writing, I dare &s;ay? I have often wi&s;h'd you for a Corre&s;pondent; for every one who can boa&s;t that Favour, exalts you to the Skies, and &s;ays, Your Letters exceed your Con|ver&s;ation; but I always in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that <HI>that</HI> was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> &s;aid I, is always &s;aying the mo&s;t obliging Things in the world of her Neighbours: But may not one &s;uffer, dear Madam, for the&s;e kind Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in the Opinion of greater Strangers, who will judge more impartially than your Favour will permit you to do?</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="426">That, &s;aid Lady <HI>Arthur,</HI> will be &s;o &s;oon put out of Doubt, when Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> begins to &s;peak, that we will refer to that, and &s;o put an End to every thing that looks like Compliment.</P>
<P>But, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> may one ask, What particular Subject was at this Time your Im|ployment?</P>
<P>I had been writing (you mu&s;t know, Lady <HI>G.</HI>) for the &s;ake of engaging Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton</HI>'s flowery Vein, a little Sketch of the Style &s;he is &s;o fond of; and hoped for &s;ome &s;uch Opportunity as this Que&s;tion gave me, to bring it on the Carpet; for my only Fear, with her, and Mi&s;s <HI>Cope,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Sutton,</HI> was, that they would deem me too grave; and &s;o what &s;hould fall in the Cour&s;e of Conver&s;ation, would make the le&s;s Impre&s;&s;ion upon them. For even the be&s;t In&s;tructions in the world, you know, will be ineffectual, if the Method of conveying them is not adapted to the Ta&s;te and Temper of the Per&s;on you would engage. Whence, as I take it, that excel|lent Rule of the Apo&s;tle, of <HI>becoming all Things to all Men.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd, That I had been meditating upon the Misfortune of a fine young Lady, who had been &s;educed and betrayed by a Gentleman &s;he loved; and who, notwith&s;tanding, had the Grace to &s;top &s;hort, (indeed, later than were to be wi&s;hed) and to abandon Friends, Country, Lover, in order to avoid any further Intercour&s;e with him; and that God had ble&s;&s;ed her Penitence and Re&s;olution, and &s;he was now very happy in a neighbouring Domi|nion.</P>
<P>A fine Subject, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton!</HI>&mdash;Was the Gentleman a Man of Wit, Madam? Was the Lady a Woman of Ta&s;te?</P>
<P>The Gentleman, Mi&s;s, was all that was de&s;irable in Man, had he been virtuous. The Lady, all that
<PB N="426" REF="427">
was excellent in Woman, had &s;he been more cir|cum&s;pect. But it was a fir&s;t Love on both Sides; and little did &s;he think he could have taken Advan|tage of her Innocence and her Affection for him.</P>
<P>A &s;ad, &s;ad Story! &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Cope:</HI> But, pray, Madam, did their Friends approve of their Vi&s;its? For Danger &s;ometimes, as I have heard, ari&s;es from the Cruelty of Friends, who force Lovers upon pri|vate and clande&s;tine Meetings; when, perhaps, there can be no material Objection, why the Gentleman and Lady may not come together.</P>
<P>Well ob&s;erv'd, Mi&s;s <HI>Cope,</HI> thought I! How we are for making every Ca&s;e applicable to our own, when our Hearts are fix'd upon a Point?</P>
<P>It cannot be called <HI>Cruelty</HI> in Friends, Mi&s;s, &s;aid I, when their Cautions, or even <HI>Prohibitions,</HI> are &s;o well ju&s;tify'd by the Event, as in <HI>this</HI> Ca&s;e&mdash;and <HI>generally</HI> by the wicked Arts and Practices of Se|ducers. And how happy is it for a Lady, when &s;he &s;uffers her&s;elf to be convinc'd, that tho&s;e who have lived <HI>Forty</HI> Years in the World, may know twice as much, at lea&s;t, of that World, as &s;he can po&s;&s;ibly know at <HI>Twenty,</HI> Ten of which moreover are almo&s;t a Blank! If they do <HI>not,</HI> the one mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed very ignorant; the other, very knowing.</P>
<P>But, Mi&s;s, the Lady, who&s;e hard Ca&s;e I was meditating, <HI>hop'd</HI> too much, and <HI>fear'd</HI> too little; that was her Fault; which made her give Opportu|nities to the Gentleman, which neither <HI>Liberty</HI> nor <HI>Re&s;traint</HI> could ju&s;tify in her. She had not the Di&s;|cretion, poor Lady! in this one great Point of all, that the Ladies I have in my Eye, I dare &s;ay, would have had in her Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I beg Pardon, &s;aid Mi&s;s, and blu&s;h'd. I know not the Ca&s;e, and ought to have been &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Ay, Mi&s;s, thought I, &s;o you would, had not you thought your&s;elf more affected by it, than were to be wi&s;h'd you were.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="428">I think, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Sutton,</HI> the Lady was the le&s;s to be pity'd, as &s;he mu&s;t know what her Character requir'd of her; and that Men will deceive, where|ever they are tru&s;ted. 'Tis <HI>their</HI> Place to ask; a <HI>Lady's</HI> to deny.</P>
<P>So, Mi&s;s, reply'd I, you are &s;uppo&s;ing a continual State of War between the Two Sexes; one offen&s;ive, the other defen&s;ive: And&punc; indeed, I think the Notion not ami&s;s; for a Lady will a&s;&s;uredly be le&s;s in Danger, when &s;he rather <HI>fears</HI> an <HI>Enemy,</HI> than <HI>hopes</HI> a <HI>Friend,</HI> where &s;o much depends upon the I&s;&s;ue, either of her Doubt, or of her Confidence.</P>
<P>I don't know <HI>neither,</HI> Madam, return'd Mi&s;s, very briskly, whether the Men &s;hould be &s;et out to us as &s;uch Bugbears, as our Mamma's generally repre&s;ent them. It is doing too much Honour to their Sex. It is making them too con&s;iderable; and is a kind of Reflection upon the Di&s;cretion and Virtue of our own, &s;uppo&s;ing us weak indeed.</P>
<P>The late Czar, I have read, continued Mi&s;s, took a better Method with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who had often beat him; when, after a great Victory, he made his Captives march in Proce&s;&s;ion, thro' the Streets of his principal City, to familiarize them to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es,</HI> and &s;hew them they were <HI>but</HI> Men.</P>
<P>Very well ob&s;erv'd, Mi&s;s, reply'd I: But then, did you not &s;ay, that this was thought nece&s;&s;ary to be done, becau&s;e the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> had been often <HI>defeated</HI> by the&s;e <HI>Swedes,</HI> and thought <HI>too highly</HI> of them; and when the <HI>Swedes,</HI> taking Advantage of that Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, had the <HI>greater Contempt</HI> for the <HI>Ru&s;&s;es?</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s looked a little di&s;concerted; and being &s;ilent, I proceeded;</P>
<P>I am very far, Mi&s;s, from thinking the Genera|lity of Men con&s;iderable, if our Sex do Ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, and to what their Characters require of them. Neverthele&s;s, give me Leave to &s;ay, that
<PB N="428" REF="429">
the Men I thought altogether <HI>incon&s;iderable,</HI> would not think worthy of my Company, nor give it to them, when I could avoid it. For when once they are per&s;uaded, that it is their Privilege to <HI>ask,</HI> and the Lady's only to <HI>deny,</HI> it will certainly imbolden them to &s;olicit, and to think them&s;elves acting in Character when they put the Lady upon exerting her le&s;s active Privilege. And yet I am humbly of Opinion with the Poet:
<Q>He comes <HI>too near,</HI> who comes to be <HI>deny'd.</HI></Q></P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, Mi&s;s, I was plea&s;ed with your Notion, that it would be be&s;t to look upon that Sex, e&s;pecially, if we allow them the Privilege you &s;peak of, in an <HI>ho&s;tile</HI> Light.</P>
<P>But permit me to ob&s;erve, with regard to the mo&s;t contemptible of the Species, Fops, Coxcombs, and pretty Fellows, that many a <HI>good</HI> General has been defeated, when, tru&s;ting to his &s;uperior Strength and Skill, he has de&s;pi&s;ed a <HI>truly weak</HI> Enemy.</P>
<P>I believe, Madam, return'd Mi&s;s, your Ob&s;erva|tion is very just. I have read of &s;uch In&s;tances. But, dear Madam, permit me to ask, Whether we &s;peak not too generally, when we condemn every Man who dre&s;&s;es well, and is not a Sloven, as a Fop or a Coxcomb?</P>
<P>No doubt, we do, when this is the Ca&s;e. But permit me to ob&s;erve, that you hardly ever in your Life, Mi&s;s, &s;aw a Gentleman who was <HI>very</HI> nice about his Per&s;on and Dre&s;s, that had any thing he thought of <HI>greater</HI> Con&s;equence to him&s;elf, to regard. 'Tis natural it &s;hould be &s;o; for &s;hould not the Man of <HI>Body</HI> take the greate&s;t Care to &s;et out and adorn the Part for which he thinks him&s;elf, mo&s;t valuable? And will not the Man of <HI>Mind</HI> be&s;tow his princi|pal Care in improving that Mind? Perhaps, to the Neglect of Dre&s;s, and outward Appearance, which
<PB N="429" REF="430">
is a Fault. But &s;urely, Mi&s;s, there is a Middle-way to be ob&s;erv'd between both, in the&s;e, as in mo&s;t other Ca&s;es; for a Man need not be a Sloven, any more than a Fop. He need not &s;hew a Contempt for Dre&s;s, and yet not think Appearance his fir&s;t and chief Concern; be ready to quarrel with a high Wind for di&s;compo&s;ing his Peruque, or to put on his Hat, for fear of depre&s;&s;ing his Foretop; be more afraid of a Spot upon his Cloaths, than twenty in his Mind: Be a Self-admirer, and always at the Gla&s;s, which he would perhaps never look into, could it &s;hew him the Deformity of his Mind, as well as the Finery of his Per&s;on:&mdash;Who has a Tailor for his Tutor, and a Milaner for his School-mi&s;tre&s;s; who laughs at Men of Sen&s;e (indeed, excu&s;ably perhaps in Revenge becau&s;e they laugh at him): Who calls Learning Pedantry; and looks upon the Knowlege of the Fa&s;hions, as the only u&s;eful Science to a fine Gentleman.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Ladies: I could proceed with the Character of this Species of Men; but I need not; becau&s;e every Lady pre&s;ent, I am &s;ure, would de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch an one, as much as I do, were he to fall in her way: And the rather, becau&s;e it is a certain Fact, that he who admires him&s;elf, will never admire his Lady as he ought; and if he maintains his Nicene&s;s after Marriage, it will be with a Preference to him|&s;elf again&s;t her: If not&mdash; will, &s;ink, very probably, into the worst of Slovens; for, the Mind that is capable of one Extreme, (in every Ca&s;e of human Life almo&s;t) when that goes off, if not a Man of Prudence, con&s;titutionally, in a manner, falls into its Oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>But to return to the former Subject, (for the general Attention encouraged me to proceed) per|mit me, Mi&s;s <HI>Sutton,</HI> to add, That a Lady mu&s;t run great Ri&s;ques to her Reputation, if not to her Vir|tue,
<PB N="430" REF="431">
who will admit into her Company, <HI>any</HI> Gen|tleman, who &s;hall be of Opinion, and <HI>know</HI> it to be <HI>hers,</HI> that it is <HI>his</HI> Province to ask a Favour, that &s;he thinks it becomes <HI>her</HI> to deny.</P>
<P>I believe, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s, I &s;poke the&s;e Words a little too generally: But I meant <HI>honourable</HI> Que|&s;tions, to be &s;ure.</P>
<P>There can be but <HI>one</HI> honourable Que&s;tion, thought I; and that is &s;eldom asked, but when the Affair is brought near a Conclu&s;ion, and there is a Probability of its being granted; and which a Single Lady, while &s;he has Parents or Guardians, &s;hould never think of permitting to be put to her&s;elf, much le&s;s of approving, nor, perhaps, as the Ca&s;e may be, of denying; but I would not pu&s;h her too far, altho' there was Room to have made the young Lady blu&s;h for her incon&s;iderate Notion.</P>
<P>So, I &s;aid, I don't <HI>doubt,</HI> Mi&s;s, but you meant honourable Que&s;tions. A young Lady of Mi&s;s <HI>Sutton</HI>'s good Sen&s;e, and worthy Character, could not mean otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And yet Mi&s;s appear'd to be under an agreeable Confu&s;ion, every Lady, by her Eye, &s;eeming to think &s;he had met with a de&s;erv'd Rebuke; and which not &s;eeming to expect, it abated her Liveli|ne&s;s all the Time after, and turn'd, as I may &s;ay, her <HI>Tongue</HI> into <HI>Ear.</HI></P>
<P>Lady <HI>Towers</HI> &s;ea&s;onably reliev'd us both from a Subject too <HI>applicable,</HI> if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, &s;aying, But, dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> will you favour us with the Re|&s;ult of your Meditation, if you have committed it to Writing, on the unhappy Ca&s;e you mention'd?</P>
<P>I was rather. Madam, exerci&s;ing my Fancy than my Judgment, &s;uch as it is, upon the Occa&s;ion. I was aiming at a kind of allegorical or metaphori|cal Style, I know not which to call it; and it is not fit to be read before &s;uch Judges, I doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="432">O pray, dear Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton,</HI> favour us with it <HI>to chu&s;e</HI>; for I am a great Admirer of that Style.</P>
<P>We &s;hall never know half your Excellencies, &s;aid Lady <HI>Arthur:</HI> I have a great Curio&s;ity, both from the <HI>Subject</HI> and the <HI>Style,</HI> to hear what you have written: And I beg you will oblige us all.</P>

<P>It is &s;hort and unfini&s;h'd. It is de&s;ign'd to be woven into a Letter to a dear Friend: And let it be ever &s;o cen&s;urable, I &s;hould be <HI>more</HI> &s;o, if I made any Difficulties after &s;uch an unanimous Reque&s;t. So taking it out of my Letter-ca&s;e, I read as fol|lows:</P>

<P>They were all greatly taken with what I read, and the Dean gave it Beauties by his kind Comments, which he him&s;elf could hardly think it merited, &s;up|po&s;ing, no doubt, that it might afford a Subject for the young Ladies to contemplate upon in their own Ta&s;te, as one may &s;ay. Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton</HI> particularly appear'd &s;o delighted with it, that &s;he de&s;ired a Copy of it; and the other Three young Ladies complai|&s;antly join'd in her Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Whereupon I &s;aid, That if it could have the Benefit of the Dean's Remarks upon it, it would be worthy of their Acceptance: But, however, it was at their Service; for I had the rough Sketch of it above.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton</HI> took it, promi&s;ing to give each a Copy, and honour'd it with a Place in her Bo&s;om. I mention this, becau&s;e it an&s;wer'd my End; and, &s;light as the Cau&s;e was, gave the young flighty Ladies an high Opinion of me, which made them li&s;ten with the greater Attention to all that &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Our Conver&s;ation, after this, took a more general Turn, as to the Air of it, if I may &s;ay &s;o, Which I thought right, le&s;t the young Ladies &s;hould imagine it was a de&s;igned Thing again&s;t them: But yet it was &s;uch, that every one of them found her Cha|racter and Ta&s;te little or much concerned in it; and all &s;eem'd, as Lady <HI>Towers</HI> afterwards ob&s;erv'd to me, by their Silence and Attention, to be bu&s;ied with private Applications.</P>
<P>The Dean began fir&s;t, with a View to his own Daughter; and &s;eeing his Drift, I humour'd it accord|ingly;
<PB N="433" REF="434">
and the rather, as Mi&s;s <HI>Cope</HI>'s Ca&s;e was included in that of Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> He was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That I &s;eem'd de&s;ign'd by Providence, as a Model, as well as an Exemplar, for my Sex; and it was Matter of great Surprize to him, that, my tender Years con|&s;ider'd, I &s;hould be capable of making tho&s;e Refle|ctions, by which Per&s;ons of twice my Age and Experience might be instructed. You &s;ee, Madam, &s;aid he, how attentive we all are, when your Lips begin to open; and I beg we may have nothing to do, but to <HI>be</HI> attentive.</P>
<P>I have had &s;uch Advantages, Sir, reply'd I, from the Ob&s;ervations and Cautions of my late excellent Lady, that did you but know half of them, you would rather wonder I had made <HI>no greater</HI> Improvement, than that I have made <HI>&s;o much.</HI> She u&s;ed to think me pretty, and not ill-temper'd, and, <HI>of cour&s;e,</HI> not incredulous, where I conceived a good Opinion; and was always arming me on that Side, as believ|ing I might be the Object of wicked Attempts, and the rather, as my low Fortunes &s;ubjected me to Danger. For, had I been born to Rank and Con|dition, as the&s;e young Ladies here, I &s;hould have had Rea&s;on to think of <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> as ju&s;tly, as, no doubt, <HI>they</HI> do, and, of con&s;equence, beyond the Reach of any vile Intriguer; as I &s;hould have been above the greate&s;t Part of that Species of Mankind, who, for want of Under&s;tanding or Honour, or thro' pernicious Habits, give them&s;elves up to Liber|tini&s;m.</P>
<P>Charming Humility! &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Cope,</HI> with her Hands lifted up. So &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e were great Advantages, no doubt, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Sutton</HI>; but in <HI>you,</HI> they met with a &s;urpri&s;ing Genius, 'tis very plain, Madam; and there is not, in my Opinion, a Lady in <HI>England</HI> of your Years, who would have improv'd by them, as you have done.</P>
<P><PB N="434" REF="435">I an&s;wer'd, That I was much obliged to her for her good Opinion: But that I had always ob&s;erv'd, that the Per&s;on who admir'd any good Qualities in another, gave a kind of <HI>natural</HI> Demon&s;tration, that &s;he had the &s;ame in an eminent Degree her&s;elf, altho', per|haps, her mode&s;t Diffidence would not permit her to trace the generous Principle to its Source.</P>
<P>The Dean, in order to bring us back again to our Subject, repeated my Remark, that it was &s;afer, in Ca&s;es where &s;o much depended upon the I&s;&s;ue, as a Lady's Honour and Reputation, to <HI>fear</HI> an <HI>Enemy,</HI> than to <HI>hope</HI> a <HI>Friend</HI>; and prai&s;ed my Ob&s;ervation, that even a <HI>weak</HI> Enemy is not to be too much de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I had very high Notions of the Honour and Value of my own Sex, and very mean ones of the gay and frothy Part of the other; in&s;omuch that I thought they could have no Strength, but what was founded in our Weakne&s;s: That, indeed, the Difference of Education must give Men Advan|tages, even where the Genius was naturally equal; and among others, Courage and Hardne&s;s of Hearts, which make Ladies, where they meet not with Men of Honour, to engage upon very unequal Terms; for that it was &s;o cu&s;tomary with them to make Vows and Promi&s;es, and to &s;et &s;o light by them, <HI>when made,</HI> that an innocent Lady cannot guard too watchfully again&s;t them; and, in my Opinion, &s;hould believe nothing they &s;aid, or even <HI>vow'd,</HI> but what carry'd Demon&s;tration with it.</P>
<P>I remember, continued I, my Lady u&s;ed often to ob&s;erve, That there was a Time of Life in all young Per&s;ons, which might properly be called, <HI>The Roman|tick,</HI> which was a very dangerous Period, and requir'd therefore a great Guard of Prudence: That the Ri&s;que was not a little augmented by reading Novels and Romances; and that the Poetical Tribe had much
<PB N="435" REF="436">
to an&s;wer for on this Head, by rea&s;on of their in|flaming and unnatural De&s;criptions, which did much Hurt to thoughtle&s;s Minds, and lively Imaginations. For to tho&s;e, &s;he would have it, were principally owing, the Ra&s;hne&s;s and Indi&s;cretion of even <HI>&s;oft</HI> and <HI>tender</HI> Di&s;po&s;itions; which, in Breach of their Duty, and even Decorum of Sex, too frequently &s;et them upon Enterprizes, like what they have read in tho&s;e pernicious Writings, which not &s;eldom make them fall a Sacrifice to the ba&s;e De&s;igns of &s;ome vile Intriguer; and even in Ca&s;es where their Precipita|tion ends the be&s;t, that is to &s;ay, in <HI>Marriage,</HI> they too frequently (in direct Oppo&s;ition to the Cautions and Commands of their <HI>try'd,</HI> their <HI>experienc'd,</HI> and <HI>unque&s;tionable</HI> Friends) throw them&s;elves upon an <HI>almo&s;t Stranger,</HI> who, had he not been unworthy of them, would not, nor <HI>needed</HI> to have taken indirect Methods to obtain their Favour.</P>
<P>And the Misfortune is, continu'd I, the mo&s;t innocent are generally the mo&s;t credulous. They would do no Harm to others them&s;elves, and can|not think others would do them any. And with regard to the particular Per&s;on who has obtain'd, perhaps, a Share in her Confidence, <HI>he</HI> cannot, &s;urely, &s;he thinks, be &s;o <HI>ingrateful,</HI> as to return Evil for Good! Were all the Men in the World, be&s;ides, to prove fal&s;e, the <HI>beloved</HI> Per&s;on cannot. 'Twould be unju&s;t to <HI>her own Merit,</HI> as well as to <HI>his Vows,</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e it: And &s;o <HI>De&s;ign</HI> on his Side, and <HI>Credulity</HI> and <HI>Self-opinion</HI> on the Lady's, at la&s;t inroll the unhappy Believer in the Li&s;t of the too-late Repenters.</P>
<P>And what, Madam, &s;aid the Dean, has not that Wretch to an&s;wer for, who makes Sport of de&s;troying a virtuous Character, and in being the wicked Means of throwing, perhaps, upon the Town, and into the Dregs of Pro&s;titution, a poor Creature, who&s;e Love
<PB N="436" REF="437">
for him, and Confidence in him, was all her Crime, and who otherwi&s;e might have made a worthy Figure at the Head of &s;ome reputable Family, propagating good Examples, in&s;tead of Ruin and Infamy, to Mankind; and &s;o have been an u&s;eful Member of the Commonwealth? To &s;ay nothing of, what is &s;till wor&s;e, the dreadful Crime of occa&s;ioning the Lo&s;s of a Soul; &s;ince final Impenitence too gene|nerally follows the fir&s;t Sacrifice which the poor Wretch is &s;educed to make of her Honour?</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Gentlemen in our Neighbour|hood, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Brooks,</HI> who might be benefited by this touching Reflection, if it was repre&s;ented in the &s;ame &s;trong Lights from the Pulpit. And permit me to &s;ay, Mr. Dean, that, I think, you &s;hould give us a Sermon upon this Subject, for the &s;ake of both Sexes; one for Caution, the other for Conviction.</P>
<P>I will think of it, reply'd he. But I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that we have too many among our younger Gentry, who would think them&s;elves pointed at, were I to touch this Subject ever &s;o cautiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> there cannot well be a more u&s;eful one; and the very Rea&s;on the Dean gives, is a convincing Proof of it to me.</P>
<P>When I have had the Plea&s;ure of hearing the further Sentiments of &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly as this, upon the delicate Subject, reply'd this polite Divine, I &s;hall be better enabled to treat it. And, pray, Ladies, proceed; for it is from your Conver&s;ation, that I mu&s;t take my Hints.</P>
<P>You have nothing to do then, &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> but to engage Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> to &s;peak; and you may be &s;ure, we will all be as attentive to <HI>her,</HI> as we &s;hall be to <HI>you,</HI> when we &s;hall have the Plea&s;ure to hear &s;o fine a Genius improving upon her Hints, from the Pulpit.</P>
<P>I bow'd, as the Dean did, to Lady <HI>Towers</HI>; and knowing, that &s;he prai&s;ed me &s;o highly, in order to
<PB N="437" REF="438">
induce the young Ladies to give the greater Attention to what &s;he wi&s;hed I &s;hould &s;peak, I &s;aid, It would be almo&s;t an unpardonable Pre&s;umption in me, after &s;o high a Compliment, to open my Lips. Never|thele&s;s, as I was &s;ure, by &s;peaking, I &s;hould have the Benefit of In&s;truction, whenever it made <HI>them</HI> &s;peak, I would not be backward to enter upon any Sub|ject; for that I &s;hould con&s;ider my&s;elf as a young Coun&s;el, in &s;ome great Cau&s;e, who &s;erved but to open it, and prepare the Way for tho&s;e of greater Skill and Abilities.</P>
<P>I beg then, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton,</HI> you will <HI>open the Cau&s;e,</HI> be the Subject what it will. And I could almo&s;t wi&s;h, that we had as many Gentlemen here as Ladies, who would have Rea&s;on to be a&s;ham'd of the Liberties they take in cen&s;uring the Conver|&s;ations of the Tea-table; &s;ince the Pulpit, as the worthy Dean gives us Rea&s;on to hope, may be beholden to that of Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is it much Wonder, reply'd I, when the Dean him&s;elf is with us, and it is grac'd by &s;o charming and di&s;tingui&s;h'd a Circle.</P>
<P>If many of our young Gentlemen were here, &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> they might improve them&s;elves in all the Graces of polite and &s;incere Complai&s;ance. But, compar'd to this, I have generally heard &s;uch trite and coar&s;e Stuff from our Race of Wou'd-be-wits, that what they &s;ay, may be compar'd to the Fawn|ings and Salutations of the A&s;s in the Fable, who emulating the Lap-dog, merited a Cudgel rather than Encouragement.</P>
<P>But, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> continued &s;he, begin, I pray you, to <HI>open</HI> and <HI>proceed</HI> in the Cau&s;e; for there will be no Coun&s;el imploy'd but you, I can tell you.</P>
<P>Then give me a Subject, that will &s;uit me, Ladies, and you &s;hall &s;ee how my Obedience to your Com|mands will make me run on.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="439">Will you, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton,</HI> give us a few Cautions and In&s;tructions on a Theme of your own, That a young Lady &s;hould rather <HI>fear</HI> too much, than <HI>hope</HI> too much? A nece&s;&s;ary Doctrine perhaps; but a difficult one to be practi&s;ed by a Lady, who has begun to love, and &s;uppo&s;es all Truth and Honour in the Object of her Favour.</P>
<P><HI>Hope,</HI> Mi&s;s, &s;aid I, in my Opinion, &s;hould never be unaccompany'd by <HI>Fear</HI>; and the more Rea&s;on will a Lady ever have to fear, and to &s;u&s;pect her&s;elf, and doubt her Lover, when &s;he once begins to find in her own Brea&s;t a Favour for him. For then her Danger is doubled, &s;ince &s;he has <HI>her&s;elf</HI> (perhaps, the more dangerous Enemy of the two) to guard again&s;t, as well as <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>She may &s;ecretly hope the be&s;t indeed; but what <HI>has been</HI> the Fate of others, <HI>may be</HI> her own; and tho' &s;he thinks it not <HI>probable</HI> from &s;uch a faithful Prote&s;ter, as he appears to her to be, yet while it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> &s;he &s;hould never be off her Guard: Nor will a prudent Woman tru&s;t to his Mercy, or Ho|nour, but to her own Di&s;cretion; and the rather, becau&s;e, if he mean well, he <HI>him&s;elf</HI> will value her the more for her Caution, &s;ince every Man de&s;ires to have a virtuous and prudent Wife; if not well, &s;he will detect him the &s;ooner; and &s;o, by her Pru|dence, fru&s;trate all his ba&s;e De&s;igns.</P>
<P>The Ladies &s;eeming, by their Silence, to approve what I &s;aid, I proceeded:</P>
<P>But let me, my dear Ladies, ask, What that Pa&s;|&s;ion is, which generally we dignify by the Name of <HI>Love</HI>; and which, when <HI>&s;o</HI> dignify'd, puts us upon a thou&s;and Extravagancies? I believe, if it were to be examined into, it would be found too generally to owe its Original to <HI>ungovern'd Fancy</HI>; and were we to judge of it by the Con&s;equences that u&s;ually attend it, it ought rather to be called <HI>Ra&s;hne&s;s, Incon&s;ideration, Weak|ne&s;s</HI>;
<PB N="439" REF="440">
any thing but <HI>Love</HI>; for, very &s;eldom, I doubt, is the <HI>&s;olid Judgment</HI> &s;o much concern'd in it, as the <HI>airy Fancy.</HI> But when once we dignify the wild Mi&s;leader with the Name of <HI>Love,</HI> all the Ab&s;urdities, which we have read in Novels and Romances, take Place, and we are induc'd to fol|low Examples that &s;eldom end happily but in <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>But, permit me further to ob&s;erve, that Love, as we call it, operates differently in the Two Sexes, as to its Effects. For in Woman it is a <HI>creeping</HI> Thing, in Man an <HI>Incroacher</HI>; and this ought, in my humble Opinion, to be very &s;eriou&s;ly attended to. Mi&s;s <HI>Sutton</HI> intimated thus much, when &s;he ob&s;erv'd, that it was the Man's Province to ask, the Lady's to deny &mdash; Excu&s;e me, Mi&s;s, the Ob&s;erva|tion was ju&s;t, as to the Mens Notions; altho', me|thinks, I would not have a Lady allow of it, except in Ca&s;es of Caution to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Doubt therefore, proceeded I, which a Lady has of her <HI>Lover's</HI> Honour, is needful to pre|&s;erve <HI>her own,</HI> and <HI>his</HI> too. And if &s;he does him Wrong, and he &s;hould be too ju&s;t to deceive her, &s;he can make him Amends, by In&s;tances of greater Confidence, when &s;he plea&s;es. But if &s;he has been accu&s;tom'd to grant him little Favours, can &s;he ea&s;ily recal them? and will not the <HI>Incroacher</HI> grow upon her Indulgence, pleading for a Favour To-day, which was not refu&s;ed him Ye&s;terday, and reproach|ing her want of Confidence, as a want of E&s;teem; till the poor Lady, who, perhaps, has given way to this <HI>creeping, in&s;inuating</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion, and has avow'd her E&s;teem for him, puts her&s;elf too much in his Power, in order to manife&s;t, as &s;he thinks, the <HI>Genero&s;ity</HI> of her Affection; and &s;o, by Degrees, is carry'd farther than &s;he intended, or nice Honour ought to have permitted; and all becau&s;e, to keep up to my Theme, &s;he <HI>hopes</HI> too much, and <HI>doubts</HI> too little? And,
<PB N="440" REF="441">
permit me, Ladies, to add, That there have been Ca&s;es, where a Gentleman him&s;elf, pur&s;uing the Dictates of his <HI>incroaching</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion, and finding a Lady <HI>too conceding,</HI> has taken Advantages, that, pro|bably, at fir&s;t, he did not pre&s;ume to think of.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton</HI> &s;aid, That <HI>Virtue</HI> it&s;elf &s;poke when I &s;poke; and &s;he was re&s;olv'd, when &s;he came home, to recollect as much of this Conver&s;ation as was po&s;&s;ible, and write it down in her Common-place Book, where it would make a better Figure than any thing &s;he had there.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, Mi&s;s, &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> your chief Collections are Flowers of Rhetorick, pick'd up from the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets, and Novel-writers. I would give &s;omething for the Plea&s;ure of having it two Hours in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fie, Madam, reply'd Mi&s;s, a little aba&s;h'd, How can you expo&s;e your Kin&s;woman thus, before the Dean and Mrs. <HI>B.?</HI></P>
<P>Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> Mi&s;s, &s;aid I, only &s;ays this to pro|voke you to &s;hew your Collections. I wi&s;h I had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them. I doubt not but your Common-place Book is a Store-hou&s;e of Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>There is nothing bad in it, I hope, &s;aid Mi&s;s; but I would not, that Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;hould &s;ee it, for the World. But, let me tell you, Madam, to Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> there are many beautiful Things, and good In&s;tructions, to be collected from Novels, and Plays, and Romances; and from the poetical Writers particu|larly, light as you are plea&s;ed to make of them. Pray, Madam, (to me) have you ever been at all conver&s;ant in &s;uch Writers?</P>
<P>Not a great deal, Mi&s;s; there were very few Novels and Romances, that my Lady would permit me to read; and tho&s;e I did, gave me no great Plea&s;ure; for either they dealt &s;o much in the <HI>Mar|vellous</HI> and <HI>Improbable,</HI> or were &s;o unnaturally
<PB N="441" REF="442">
<HI>inflaming</HI> to the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and &s;o full of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Intrigue,</HI> that hardly any of them but &s;eem'd calcu|lated to <HI>fire</HI> the <HI>Imagination,</HI> rather than to <HI>inform</HI> the <HI>Judgment.</HI> Tilts and Tournaments, breaking of Spears in Honour of a Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;wimming of Rivers, engaging with Mon&s;ters, rambling in Search of Adventures, making unnatural Difficulties, in order to &s;hew the Knight-Errant's Prowe&s;s in overcoming them, is all that is requir'd to con&s;titute the <HI>Hero</HI> in &s;uch Pieces. And what principally di&s;tingui&s;hes the Character of the <HI>Heroine,</HI> is, when &s;he is taught to con&s;ider her Father's Hou&s;e as an inchanted Ca&s;tle, and her Lover as the Hero who is to di&s;|&s;olve the Charm, and to &s;et her at Liberty from one Confinement, in order to put her into another, and, too probably, a wor&s;e: To in&s;truct her how to climb Walls, drop from Windows, leap Precipices, and do twenty other extravagant Things, in order to &s;hew the mad Strength of a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he ought to be a&s;ham'd of: To make Parents and Guardians pa&s;s for Tyrants, and the Voice of Rea&s;on to be drown'd in that of indi&s;creet Love, which exalts the other Sex, and deba&s;es her own. And what is the In&s;tru|ction, that can be gather'd from &s;uch Pieces, for the Conduct of common Life?</P>
<P>Then have I been ready to quarrel with the&s;e Writers for another Rea&s;on; and that is, The dan|gerous Notion which they hardly ever fail to pro|pagate, of a <HI>Fir&s;t-&s;ight Love.</HI> For there is &s;uch a Su&s;ceptibility &s;uppo&s;ed on both Sides, (which, how|ever it may pa&s;s in a Man, very little becomes a Lady's Delicacy) that they are &s;mitten with a Glance; the <HI>fictitious</HI> blind God is made a <HI>real</HI> Divinity; and too often Prudence and Di&s;cretion are the fir&s;t Offerings at his Shrine.</P>

In&s;tances of Peoples Loving at fir&s;t Sight, which have ended very happily.</P>
<P>No doubt of it, Mi&s;s, reply'd I. But there are three Chances to one, that &s;o precipitate a Liking does not. For where can be the Room for Caution, for Inquiry, for the Di&s;play of Merit, and Sincerity, and even the A&s;&s;urance of a <HI>grateful Return,</HI> to a Lady, who thus &s;uffers her&s;elf to be prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd? Is it not a Random Shot? Is it not a Proof of Weakne&s;s? Is it not giving up the Negative Voice, which belongs to the Sex, even while &s;he doubts to meet the Affirmative one from him &s;he wi&s;hes for?</P>
<P>Indeed, Ladies, continued I, I cannot help con|cluding, (and I am the le&s;s afraid of &s;peaking my Mind, becau&s;e of the Opinion I have of the Pru|dence of every Lady that hears me) that where this Weakne&s;s is found, it is no way favourable to a Lady's Character, and to that Di&s;cretion which ought to di&s;tingui&s;h it. It looks to me, as if a Lady's <HI>Heart</HI> were too much in the Power of her <HI>Eye,</HI> and that &s;he had permitted her <HI>Fancy</HI> to be much more bu&s;y than her <HI>Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton</HI> blu&s;h'd, and look'd around her.</P>
<P>But I have generally ob&s;erv'd, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> that whenever you cen&s;ure any Indi&s;cretion, you &s;eldom fail to give Cautions how to avoid it. And pray let us know what is to be done in this Ca&s;e? That is to &s;ay, How a young Lady ought to guard again&s;t and overcome the fir&s;t favourable Im|pre&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>What I imagine, reply'd I, a young Lady ought to do, on any the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> favourable Impre&s;&s;ions of this kind, is immediately to <HI>withdraw into her&s;elf,</HI> as one may &s;ay; to reflect upon what &s;he owes to her Pa|rents, to her Family, to her Character, and to her Sex; and to re&s;olve to check &s;uch a random Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="443" REF="440">
which may much more probably, as I hinted, make her a Prey to the Unde&s;erving than otherwi&s;e, as there are &s;o many of that Character to one Man of real Merit.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t that I apprehend a <HI>Fir&s;t-&s;ight</HI> Favour can do, is to in&s;pire a <HI>Liking</HI>; and a Liking is con|querable, if the Per&s;on will not brood over it, till &s;he hatches it into <HI>Love.</HI> Then every Man and Woman has a black and a white Side; and it is ea&s;y to &s;et the Imperfections of the Per&s;on again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed Perfections, while it is only <HI>Liking.</HI> But if the bu&s;y Fancy be permitted to work as it plea&s;es, uncheck'd, uncontroul'd, then, 'tis very likely, were it but to keep it&s;elf in Countenance for her fir&s;t Im|pre&s;&s;ions, &s;he will &s;ee Perfections in the Object, which no living Soul can &s;ee but her&s;elf. And it will hardly be expected, but that, as a Con&s;equence of her fir&s;t Indi&s;cretion, &s;he will confirm, as an Act of her Judgment, what her wild and ungovern'd Fancy had mi&s;led her to think of with &s;o much partial Favour. And too late, as it may too pro|bably happen, &s;he wilt &s;ee and lament her fatal, and, perhaps, undutiful Error.</P>
<P>We are talking of the Ladies only, added I (for I &s;aw Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton</HI> was become very grave): But I believe the Ca&s;e of Fir&s;t-&s;ight Love often operates alike in both Sexes, and the &s;ame Inconveniencies may ari&s;e to both, from a Ra&s;hne&s;s of this kind: And where it is &s;o, it will be very lucky, &s;hall I &s;ay? if either Gentleman or Lady find Rea&s;on, on cool Reflection, to approve a Choice, which they were &s;o ready to make without Thought.</P>
<P>'Tis allow'd, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> that ra&s;h and precipitate Love may operate pretty much alike in the Ra&s;h and Precipitate of both Sexes; and which-&s;oever loves, generally exalts the Per&s;on beloved, above his or her Merits: But I am
<PB N="444" REF="445">
de&s;irous, for the &s;ake of us Maiden Ladies, &s;ince 'tis a Science in which you are &s;o great an Adept, to have your Advice, how we &s;hould watch and guard again&s;t its fir&s;t Incroachments, and that you will tell us what you apprehend gives the Men mo&s;t Advan|tage over us.</P>
<P>Nay, now, Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> you railly my Pre&s;um|ption indeed!</P>
<P>I admire you, Madam, reply'd &s;he, and every thing you &s;ay and do; and I won't forgive you to call what I &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly <HI>&s;ay</HI> and <HI>think,</HI> Raillery. For my own Part, continued &s;he, I never was in Love yet, nor, I believe, were any of the&s;e young Ladies &mdash; (Mi&s;s <HI>Cope</HI> looked a little &s;illy upon this&mdash;) And who can better in&s;truct us to guard <HI>our</HI> Hearts, than a Lady who has &s;o well defended <HI>her own?</HI></P>
<P>Why then, Madam, if I mu&s;t &s;peak, I think, what gives the other Sex the greate&s;t Advantage, over even many of the mo&s;t De&s;erving of ours, is, that dangerous Foible, The <HI>Love of Prai&s;e,</HI> and the De&s;ire to be <HI>flatter'd</HI> and <HI>admir'd:</HI> A Pa&s;&s;ion that I have ob&s;erv'd to predominate, more or le&s;s, from Sixteen to Sixty, in mo&s;t of our Sex. We are too generally delighted with the Company of tho&s;e who extol our Graces of Per&s;on or Mind; for will not a <HI>grateful</HI> Lady &s;tudy hard to return a <HI>few</HI> Compli|ments to a Gentleman, who makes her <HI>&s;o many?</HI> She is concern'd to <HI>prove</HI> him a Man of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Sen&s;e, or a polite Man, at lea&s;t, in regard to what &s;he <HI>thinks</HI> of her&s;elf; and &s;o the Flatterer &s;hall be preferr'd to &s;uch of the Sincere and Worthy, as cannot &s;ay what they do not think. And by this means many an excellent Lady has fallen a Prey to &s;ome &s;ordid De&s;igner.</P>
<P>Then, I think, nothing gives Gentlemen &s;o much Advantage over our Sex, as to &s;ee how readily a virtuous Lady can forgive the capital Faults of the
<PB N="445" REF="446">
mo&s;t abandon'd of the other; and that &s;ad, &s;ad Notion, <HI>That a Reform'd Rake makes the be&s;t Hu&s;|band</HI>; a Notion that has done more Hurt, and Di&s;|credit too, to our Sex, (as it has given more En|couragement to the Profligates of the other, and more Di&s;couragement to the &s;ober Gentlemen) than can be ea&s;ily imagin'd. A fine thing indeed! as if the Wretch, who had run thro' a Cour&s;e of Iniquity to the endangering of Soul and Body, was to be deem'd the be&s;t Companion for Life, to an innocent and virtuous young Lady, who is to owe the Kindne&s;s of his Treatment of her, to his having never before accompany'd with a mode&s;t Woman; nor, till his Intere&s;t on one hand, (to which his Extravagance, perhaps, compels him to attend) and his impair'd Con&s;titution on the other, oblige him him to it, <HI>wi&s;h'd</HI> to accompany with one; and who always made a Je&s;t of the marry'd State, and, per|haps, of every thing &s;acred and ju&s;t!</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve very well, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers</HI>; but People will be apt to think, that you have le&s;s Rea&s;on than any of our Sex, to be &s;evere again&s;t the Notion you &s;peak of: For who was a greater Rake than a certain Gentleman, and who a better Husband?</P>
<P>Madam, reply'd I, the Gentleman you mean never was a common Town-Rake: He is a Gentleman of Sen&s;e, and fine Under&s;tanding; and his Refor|mation, <HI>&s;econdarily,</HI> as I may &s;ay, has been the natural Effect of tho&s;e extraordinary Qualities. But be&s;ides, Madam, I will pre&s;ume to &s;ay, That that Gentle|man, as he has not many Equals in the Noblene&s;s of his Nature, &s;o is not likely, I doubt, to have many Followers, in a Reformation begun in the Bloom of Youth, upon <HI>Self-conviction,</HI> and altoge|ther, humanly &s;peaking, <HI>&s;pontaneous!</HI>&mdash; Tho&s;e young Ladies, who would plead his Example, in &s;upport
<PB N="446" REF="447">
of this pernicious Notion, &s;hould find out the &s;ame generous Qualities in the Gentleman, before they tru&s;t to it; and it will then do le&s;s Harm: tho' even then, I could not wi&s;h it to be generally pro|pagated.</P>
<P>It is really unaccountable, &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> after all, as Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> I remember, once formerly &s;aid, That our Sex &s;hould not as much in&s;i&s;t upon Vir|tue and Sobriety, in the Character of a Gentleman, as the Gentleman, be he ever &s;uch a Rake, does in that of a Lady. And 'tis certainly a great Encou|ragement to Libertini&s;m, that a worn-out Debauchee &s;hall think him&s;elf at any time good enough for an Husband, and have the Confidence to imagine, that a mode&s;t Lady will accept of his Addre&s;s with a <HI>Preference.</HI></P>
<P>I can account for it but one way, &s;aid the Dean: And that is, that a mode&s;t Lady is apt to be <HI>diffident</HI> of her&s;elf, and &s;he thinks this Diffidence an Imper|fection. A Rake <HI>never is:</HI> So he has in Perfection a Quality &s;he thinks &s;he wants; and, knowing <HI>too little</HI> of the World, imagines &s;he mends the Matter by accepting of one who knows <HI>too much.</HI></P>
<P>That's well ob&s;erv'd, Mr. Dean, &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers:</HI> But there is another Fault in our Sex, which Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> has not touch'd upon; and that is, The fooli&s;h Pride &s;ome Ladies take in taming a wild Fellow; and that they have been able to do more than many of their Sex before them could do: A Pride that often co&s;ts them dear enough; as I know in more than one In&s;tance.</P>
<P>Another Weakne&s;s, &s;aid I, might be produc'd again&s;t &s;ome of our Sex; and that is, in joining too readily to droll upon, and &s;neer at, the Misfortune of any poor young Creature, who has &s;hewn too little Regard for her Honour: And that (in&s;tead of &s;peaking of it with Concern, and thinking them|&s;elves
<PB N="447" REF="448">
happy, it was not their own Ca&s;e, and inveigh|ing again&s;t the Seducer) they will too lightly &s;port with the unhappy Creature's Fall, propagate the Knowlege of it &mdash; (I would not look upon Mi&s;s <HI>Sutton,</HI> while I &s;poke this)&mdash; and avoid her, as an In|fection; yet, after a while, not &s;cruple to admit into their Company the vile Aggre&s;&s;or, and even &s;mile with him, at his barbarous Je&s;ts upon the poor Sufferer of their own Sex.</P>
<P>I have known three or four In&s;tances of this in my Time; &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> that Mi&s;s <HI>Sutton</HI> might not take it to her&s;elf; for &s;he look'd down, and was a little &s;erious.</P>
<P>This, rejoin'd I, puts me in mind of a little hu|mourous Copy of Ver&s;es, written, as I believe, by Mr. <HI>B.</HI> And which, to the very Purpo&s;e we are &s;peaking of, he calls</P>
<P>Benefit of making others Misfortunes our own.</P>
<Q><L>Thou'&s;t heard it, or read it, a Million of Times,</L>
<L>That Men are made up of Fal&s;hoods and Crimes:</L>
<L>Search all the old Authors, and ran&s;ack the new,</L>
<L>Thou'lt find in Love-Stories, &s;carce one Mortal true.</L>
<L>Then why this complaining? And why this wry Face?</L>
<L>Is it 'cau&s;e thou'rt affected <HI>mo&s;t,</HI> with <HI>thy own</HI> Ca&s;e?</L>
<L>Had&s;t thou &s;ooner made <HI>OTHERS</HI> Misfortunes thy own,</L>
<L>Thou never, <HI>THYSELF,</HI> this Di&s;a&s;ter had&s;t known;</L>
<L>Thy <HI>compa&s;&s;ionate Caution</HI> had kept thee from Evil,</L>
<L>And thou might&s;t have defy'd Mankind and the Devil.</L></Q>
<P>The Ladies were pleas'd with the Lines; but Lady <HI>Towers</HI> wanted to know, &s;he &s;aid, at what Time of Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Life they could be written. Becau&s;e, added &s;he, I never &s;u&s;pected before, that the good Gen|tleman ever took Pains to write Cautions or Ex|hortations
<PB N="448" REF="449">
to our Sex, to avoid the Delu&s;ions of his own.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ver&s;es, and this facetious, but &s;evere Re|mark of Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> made every young Lady look up with a chearful Countenance; becau&s;e it pu&s;hed the Ball from <HI>Self:</HI> And the Dean &s;aid to his Daugh|ter; So, my Dear, You, that have been &s;o atten|tive, mu&s;t let us know, what u&s;eful Inferences you can draw from what Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> and the other Ladies have &s;o excellently &s;aid?</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, Sir, &s;aid Mi&s;s, from the Faults the Ladies have &s;o ju&s;tly imputed to &s;ome of our Sex, that the Advantage the Gentlemen <HI>chiefly</HI> have over us, is from our own Weakne&s;s; and that it behoves a prudent Lady to guard again&s;t <HI>fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> of Favour, &s;ince &s;he will think her&s;elf oblig'd, in Com|pliment to <HI>her own</HI> Judgment, to find Rea&s;ons, if po&s;&s;ible, to confirm them.</P>
<P>But I would be glad to know, Ladies, added Mi&s;s, If there be any way, that a Lady can judge, whether a Gentleman means honourably or not, in his Ad|dre&s;s to her?</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> can be&s;t inform you of that, Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers:</HI> What &s;ay you, Mrs. <HI>B.?</HI></P>
<P>There are a few Signs, an&s;wer'd I, ea&s;y to be known, and, I think, almo&s;t infallible.</P>
<P>Pray let's have 'em, &s;aid Lady <HI>Arthur</HI>; and they all were very attentive.</P>
<P>The&s;e are they, reply'd I: I lay it down as an undoubted Truth, That true Love is one of the mo&s;t <HI>re&s;pectful</HI> Things in the World. It &s;trikes with Awe and Reverence the Mind of the Gentleman, who boa&s;ts its Impre&s;&s;ion. It is cha&s;te and pure in Word and Deed, and cannot bear to have the lea&s;t Indecency mingle with it.</P>
<P>If therefore a Gentleman, be his Birth or Quality what it will, the higher the wor&s;e, pre&s;ume to wound
<PB N="449" REF="450">
a Lady's Ears with indecent Words: If he endeavour, in his Expre&s;&s;ions or Sentiments, to convey gro&s;s or impure Ideas to her Mind: If he is continually pre&s;&s;ing for <HI>her Confidence</HI> in <HI>his</HI> Honour: If he re|que&s;ts Favours, which a Lady ought to refu&s;e: If he can be regardle&s;s of his Conduct or Behaviour to her: If he can u&s;e <HI>boi&s;terous</HI> or <HI>rude</HI> Freedoms, either to her <HI>Per&s;on</HI> or <HI>Dre&s;s</HI>&mdash; (Here poor Mi&s;s <HI>Cope,</HI> by her Blu&s;hes, bore Witne&s;s to her Ca&s;e&mdash;) If he avoids <HI>&s;peaking</HI> of <HI>Marriage,</HI> when he has a <HI>fair Opportunity</HI> of doing it (&mdash;Here Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> look'd down, and blu&s;h'd&mdash;) or leaves it <HI>once</HI> to a Lady to wonder that he does not:</P>
<P>In any, or in all the&s;e Ca&s;es, he is to be &s;u&s;pected, and a Lady can have little Hope of &s;uch a Per&s;on, nor, as I humbly apprehend, con&s;i&s;tent with Honour and Di&s;cretion, encourage his Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Ladies were &s;o kind, as to applaud all I &s;aid, and &s;o did the Dean. Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Cope,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> were to try to recollect it when they came home, and to write down what they could remember of the Conver&s;ation: And our noble Gue&s;ts coming in &s;oon after, with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Ladies would have departed; but he prevailed upon them, with &s;ome Difficulty, to pa&s;s the Evening; and Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> who has an admirable Finger at the Spinnet, as I have heretofore told you, obliged us with two or three Tunes. Each of the Ladies did the like, and prevailed upon me to play a Tune or two: But Mi&s;s <HI>Cope,</HI> as well as Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> &s;urpa&s;s'd me much. We all &s;ung too in Turns, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> took the Violin, in which he excels. Lord <HI>Davers</HI> oblig'd us on the Harp&s;ichord: Mr. <HI>H.</HI> play'd on the Flute, and &s;ung us a Fop's Song, and perform'd it in Character. So that we had an exceeding gay Evening, and parted with great Satisfaction on <HI>all</HI> Sides, and high Delight on the young Ladies; for this put them all
<PB N="450" REF="451">
into good Humour, and good Spirits, enlivening the former Scene, which otherwi&s;e might have clo&s;ed, perhaps, more gravely than efficaciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The Di&s;tance of Time &s;ince this Conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed, enables me to add what I could not do, when I wrote the Account of it, which you have mi&s;laid: And which take briefly, as follows:</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Stapylton,</HI> upon her Return home, was as good as her Word, and wrote down all &s;he could recollect of the Conver&s;ation; and &s;uffered it to have &s;uch an Effect upon her, as to turn the Cour&s;e of her Reading and Studies, to weightier and more &s;olid Subjects; and, avoiding the Gentleman &s;he had began to favour, gave way to her Parents Re|commendation; and is happily marry'd to Sir <HI>Jona|than Barnes.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Cope</HI> came to me a Week after this, with the Leave of both her Parents, and tarry'd with me Three Days; in which time &s;he open'd all her worthy Heart to me; and return'd in &s;uch a Di&s;|po&s;ition, and with &s;uch Re&s;olutions, that &s;he never would &s;ee her Peer again; nor receive Letters from him, which &s;he own'd to me &s;he had done clan-de&s;tinely before: And &s;he is now the happy Lady of Sir <HI>Michael Beaumont,</HI> who makes her the be&s;t of Husbands, and permits her to follow her charitable Inclinations, according to a Scheme, which &s;he pre|vail'd upon me to give her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> by the Dean's indulgent Prudence and Di&s;cretion, has e&s;caped her Rake; and, upon the Di&s;covery of an Intrigue he was carrying on with another, conceived a ju&s;t Abhorrence of him; and is &s;ince marry'd to Dr. <HI>Jenkins,</HI> as you know, with whom &s;he lives very happily.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Sutton</HI> is not quite &s;o well off, as the Three former; tho' not altogether unhappy neither, in her Way. She could not indeed conquer her Love of
<PB N="451" REF="452">
Dre&s;s and Tin&s;el; and &s;o became the Lady of Col. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI>: And they are thus far ea&s;y in the Marriage State, that, being &s;eldom together, in all Probabi|lity they &s;ave a Multitude of Mi&s;under&s;tandings; for the Colonel loves Gaming, in which he is generally a Winner; and &s;o pa&s;&s;es his Time mo&s;tly in Town. His Lady has her Plea&s;ures, neither laudable nor cri|minal ones, which &s;he pur&s;ues in the Country. And now-and-then a Letter pa&s;&s;es on both Sides, by the In&s;cription and Sub&s;cription of which, they remind one another, that they have been <HI>once</HI> in their Lives at <HI>one</HI> Church together.</P>

<P>YOU de&s;ired me to &s;end you a little Specimen of my <HI>Nur&s;ery Tales</HI> and <HI>Stories,</HI> with which, as Mi&s;s <HI>Fenwick</HI> told you, on her Return to <HI>Lincoln|&s;hire,</HI> I entertain my Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and my little Boys. But you make me too high a Compliment, when you tell me, it is for your own In&s;truction and Example.

tho&s;e very Stories with which Mi&s;s <HI>Fenwick</HI> was &s;o plea&s;ed, and of which &s;he has made &s;o favourable a Report.</P>
<P>Let me acquaint you then, that my Method is, To give Characters of Per&s;ons I have known in one Part or other of my Life, in feigned Names, who&s;e Conduct may &s;erve for Imitation or Warning to my dear attentive Mi&s;s; and &s;ometimes I give In&s;tances of good Boys and naughty Boys, for the &s;ake of my <HI>Billy,</HI> and my <HI>Davers</HI>; and they are continually coming about me, Dear Madam, a pretty Story now, cries Mi&s;s: And, Dear Mamma, tell me of good Boys, and of naughty Boys, cries <HI>Billy.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s is a &s;urpri&s;ing Child, for her Age, and is very familiar with many of the be&s;t Characters in the <HI>Spectators</HI>; and having a Smattering of <HI>Latin,</HI> and more than a Smattering of <HI>Italian,</HI> and being a perfect Mi&s;tre&s;s of <HI>French,</HI> is &s;eldom at a Lo&s;s for the Derivation of even &s;uch Words as are not of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Original. And &s;o I &s;hall give you a Story in feigned Names, with which &s;he is &s;o delighted, that &s;he has wrote it down. But I will fir&s;t tre&s;pa&s;s on your Patience with one of my childi&s;h Tales.</P>
<P>Every Day once or twice, if I am not hinder'd, I cau&s;e Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> who plays and &s;ings very prettily, to give a Tune or two to me and my <HI>Billy</HI> and <HI>Davers,</HI> who, as well as my <HI>Pamela,</HI> love and learn to touch the Keys, young as the latter is; and &s;he will have a &s;weet Finger, I can &s;ee that; and a charming Ear; and her Voice is Mu&s;ick it|&s;elf!&mdash;Oh! the fond, fond Mother, I know you will &s;ay, on reading this!</P>

<P>I began with a Story of Two little Boys, and Two little Girls, the Children of a fine Gentleman and a fine Lady, who loved them dearly: That they were all &s;o good, and loved one another &s;o well, that every body who &s;aw them, admired them, and talked of them far and near: That they would part
<PB N="454" REF="455">
with any thing to one another: Loved the Poor: Spoke kindly to the Servants: Did every thing they were bid to do; were not proud; and knew no Strife, but who &s;hould learn their Books be&s;t, and be the prettie&s;t Scholar: That the Servants loved them, and would do any thing they de&s;ired; that they were not proud of fine Cloaths; let not their Heads run upon their Playthings, when they &s;hould mind their Books; &s;aid Grace before they eat; their Prayers before they went to-bed, and as &s;oon as they ro&s;e; were always clean and neat; would not tell a Fib for the World, and were above doing any thing that requir'd one: That GOD ble&s;&s;ed them more and more, and ble&s;&s;ed their Papa and Mamma, and their Uncles and Aunts, and Cou&s;ins, for their &s;akes. And there was a happy Family, my dear Loves!&mdash;No one idle; all prettily imploy'd; the Ma&s;ters at their Books; the Mi&s;&s;es at their Books too, or their Needles; except at their Play-hours, when they were never rude, nor noi&s;y, nor mi&s;|chievous, nor quarrel&s;ome: And no &s;uch Word was ever heard from their Mouths, as, Why mayn't I have this or that, as well as <HI>Billy</HI> or <HI>Bobby?</HI>&mdash;Or, Why &s;hould <HI>Sally</HI> have this or that, any more than I?&mdash; But it was, As my Mamma plea&s;es; My Mamma knows be&s;t; and a Bow and a Smile, and no Surline&s;s, or &s;couling Brow to be &s;een, if they were deny'd any thing; for well did they know, that their Papa and Mamma loved them &s;o dearly, that they would refu&s;e them nothing that was for their Good; and they were &s;ure, when they were refu&s;ed, they a&s;ked for &s;omething that would have done them hurt, had it been granted. Never were &s;uch good Boys and Girls as the&s;e! And they grew up, and the Ma&s;ters became fine Scholars, and fine Gentlemen, and every body honour'd them; and
<PB N="455" REF="456">
the Mi&s;&s;es became fine Ladies, and fine Hou&s;ewives; and this Gentleman, when they grew to be Women, &s;ought to marry one of the Mi&s;&s;es, and that Gentleman the other; and happy was he that could be admitted into their Com|panies! So that they had nothing to do but pick and chu&s;e the be&s;t Gentlemen in the County: While the greate&s;t Ladies for Birth, and the mo&s;t remark|able for Virtue, (which, my Dears, is better than either Birth or Fortune) thought them&s;elves honour'd by the Addre&s;&s;es of the Two Brothers. And they marry'd, and made good Papas and Mammas, and were &s;o many Ble&s;&s;ings to the Age in which they lived. There, my dear Loves! were happy Sons and Daughters! For good Ma&s;ters &s;eldom fail to make good Gentlemen; and good Mi&s;&s;es, good La|dies; and GOD ble&s;&s;es them with as good Children as they were to their Parents; and &s;o the Ble&s;&s;ing goes round!&mdash;Who would not but be good?</P>
<P>Well, but, Mamma, we will all be good: Won't we, Ma&s;ter <HI>Davers,</HI> cries my <HI>Billy?</HI> Yes, Brother <HI>Billy.</HI> Then they ki&s;s one another, and if they have Playthings, or any thing they like, ex|change with each other, to &s;hew the Effect my Le&s;|&s;ons have upon them. But what will become of the naughty Boys? Tell us, Mamma, about the naughty Boys!</P>
<P>Why, there was a poor, poor Widow Woman, who had Three naughty Sons, and One naughty Daughter; and they would do nothing that their Mamma bid them do; were always quarreling, &s;cratching and fighting; would not &s;ay their Prayers; would not learn their Book; &s;o that the little Boys u&s;ed to laugh at them, and point at them, as they went along, for Blockheads; and nobody loved them, or took notice of them, except to beat and thump
<PB N="456" REF="457">
them about, for their naughty Ways, and their Un|dutifulne&s;s to their poor Mother, who worked hard to maintain them. As they grew up, they grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and more and more &s;tupid and ignorant, &s;o that they impoveri&s;h'd their poor Mo|ther, and at la&s;t broke her Heart, poor, poor Wi|dow Woman!&mdash;And her Neighbours joined toge|ther to bury the poor Widow Woman; for the&s;e &s;ad ungracious Children made away with what little &s;he had left, while &s;he was ill, before her Heart was quite broken: And this helped to break it the &s;ooner; for had &s;he liv'd, &s;he &s;aw &s;he mu&s;t have wanted Bread, and had no Comfort from &s;uch wicked Children.</P>
<P>Poor, poor Widow Woman! &s;aid my <HI>Billy,</HI> with Tears; and my little Dove &s;hed Tears too, and <HI>Davers</HI> was moved, and Mi&s;s wiped her fine Eyes.</P>
<P>But what became of the naughty Boys, and the naughty Girl, Mamma!&mdash;Became of them! Why one Son was forced to go to Sea, and there he was drowned: Another turned Thief; for he would not work, and he came to an untimely End: The third was idle, and ignorant, and nobody would imploy him, that knew how he had u&s;ed his poor Mother, and &s;o he was forced to go into a far Country, and beg his Bread. And the naughty Girl, having never lov'd Work, pined away in Sloth and Filthine&s;s, and at la&s;t broke her Arm, and died of a Fever, lamenting too late, that &s;he had been &s;o wicked a Daughter to &s;o good a Mo|ther!&mdash;And &s;o there was a &s;ad End of all the Four ungracious Children, who never would mind what their poor Mother &s;aid to them; and GOD puni&s;hed their Naughtine&s;s, as you &s;ee!&mdash;While the good Children I mentioned before, were the Ornament
<PB N="457" REF="458">
and the Glory of their Family, and the Delight of every body that knew them.</P>
<P>Who would not be good! was the Inference: And the Repetition from <HI>Billy,</HI> with his Hands clapt together, Poor, poor Widow Woman!&mdash;gave me much Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>So my childi&s;h Story ended, with a Ki&s;s of each pretty Dear, and their Thanks for my Story: And then came on Mi&s;s's Reque&s;t for a <HI>Woman</HI>'s Story, as &s;he called it. I di&s;mi&s;s'd my Babies to their Play|in the Apartment allotted for that purpo&s;e; and taking Mi&s;s's Hand, &s;he &s;tanding before me, all Attention, began in a more womanly Strain to <HI>her</HI>; for &s;he is very fond of being thought a Woman; and indeed is a prudent, &s;en&s;ible Dear, compre|hends any thing in&s;tantly, and makes very pretty Reflections upon what &s;he hears or reads, as you will ob&s;erve in what follows:</P>
<P>There is nothing, my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin,</HI> that young Ladies &s;hould be &s;o watchful over, as their Re|putation: 'Tis a tender Flower, that the lea&s;t Fro&s;t will nip, the lea&s;t cold Wind will bla&s;t; and when once bla&s;ted, it will never flouri&s;h again; but wither to the very Root. But this I have told you &s;o often, that I am &s;ure I need not repeat what I have &s;aid. So to my Story.</P>
<P>There were Four pretty Ladies lived in one gen|teel Neighbourhood, the Daughters of Four &s;everal Families; but all Companions, and Vi&s;itors; and yet all of very different Inclinations. COQUETILLA we will call one, PRUDIANA another, PROFU|SIANA the third, and PRUDENTIA the fourth; their &s;everal Names denoting their re&s;pective Qua|lities.</P>
<P>COQUETILLA a was the only Daughter of a wor|thy Baronet, by a Lady very gay, but rather indi&s;creet
<PB N="458" REF="459">
than unvirtuous, who took not due care of her Daughter's Education, but let her be over-run with the Love of Fa&s;hions, Dre&s;s, and Equipage; and when in <HI>London,</HI> Balls, Operas, Plays, the Park, the Ring, the Withdrawing-Room, took up her whole Attention. She admir'd nobody but her&s;elf, flutter'd about, laughing at, and de&s;pi&s;ing a Croud of Men-Followers, whom &s;he attracted by gay, thoughtle&s;s Freedoms of Behaviour, too nearly tread|ing on the Skirts of Immode&s;ty: Yet made &s;he not one worthy Conque&s;t, exciting, on the contrary, in all &s;ober Minds, that Contempt upon her&s;elf, which &s;he &s;o profu&s;ely would be thought to pour down upon the re&s;t of the World, After &s;he had &s;everal Years flutter'd about the dangerous Light, like &s;ome &s;illy Fly, &s;he at la&s;t &s;indged the Wings of her Repu|tation; for, being de&s;pi&s;ed by every worthy Heart, &s;he became too ea&s;y and cheap a Prey to a Man the mo&s;t: unworthy of all her Followers, who had Re&s;o|lution and Confidence enough to break thro' tho&s;e few cobweb Re&s;erves, in which &s;he had incircled her precarious Virtue; and which were no longer of Force to pre&s;erve her Honour, than till &s;he met with a Man more bold and more enterpri&s;ing than her&s;elf, and who was as de&s;igning as &s;he was thought|le&s;s. And what then became of <HI>Coquetilla?</HI>&mdash;Why &s;he was forced to pa&s;s over Sea, to <HI>Ireland,</HI> where nobody knew her, and to bury her&s;elf in a dull Ob|&s;curity; to go by another Name; and at la&s;t, un|able to &s;upport a Life &s;o un&s;uitable to the natural Gaiety of her Temper, &s;he pin'd her&s;elf into a Con|&s;umption, and dy'd unpity'd and unlamented, among Strangers, and having not one Friend but whom &s;he bought with her Money.</P>
<P>Poor Lady <HI>Coquetilla!</HI> &s;aid Mi&s;s; what a &s;ad thing it is, to have a wrong Education! And how
<PB N="459" REF="460">
happy am I, who have &s;o good a Lady to &s;upply the Place of a dear di&s;tant Mamma!&mdash;But be plea&s;ed; Madam, to proceed to the next.</P>
<P>PRUDIANA, my Dear, was the Daughter of a Gentleman who was a Widower, having, while the young Lady was an Infant, bury'd her Mamma. He was a good &s;ort of Man; but had but one Le&s;&s;on to teach to <HI>Prudiana,</HI> and that was, To avoid all manner of Conver&s;ation with the Men; but never gave her the right Turn of Mind, nor in&s;tilled into it that Sen&s;e of her religious Duties, which would have been her be&s;t Guard in all Temptations. For, &s;o as &s;he kept out of the Sight and Conver&s;ation of the Gentlemen, and avoided the Company of tho&s;e Ladies, who more freely conver&s;ed with the other Sex, it was all her Papa de&s;ired of her. This gave her a haughty, &s;ullen, and re&s;erved Turn; made her &s;tiff, formal, and affected. She had Sen&s;e enough to di&s;cover early the Faults of <HI>Coquetilla,</HI> and, in Di&s;like of them, fell the more ea&s;ily into that con|trary Extreme which her reclu&s;e Education, and her Papa's Cautions, naturally led her. So that Pride, Re&s;erve, Affectation, and Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, made up the E&s;&s;entials of her Character, and &s;he became more unamiable even than <HI>Coquetilla</HI>; and as the other was too acce&s;&s;ible, <HI>Prudiana</HI> was quite unapproachable by Gentlemen, and unfit for any Conver&s;ation, but that of her Servants, being al&s;o de&s;erted by tho&s;e of her own Sex, by whom &s;he might have improv'd, on account of her cen&s;orious Di&s;po&s;ition. And what was the Con&s;equence? Why this: Every worthy Per&s;on of both Sexes de|&s;pi&s;ing her, and &s;he being u&s;ed to &s;ee nobody but Ser|vants, at la&s;t throws her&s;elf upon one of that Cla&s;s: In an evil Hour, &s;he finds &s;omething that is taking to her low Ta&s;te in the Per&s;on of her Papa's Valet,
<PB N="460" REF="461">
a Wretch &s;o infinitely beneath her, (but a Coxcomb of a Servant) that every body attributed to her the Scandal of making the fir&s;t Advances; for, otherwi&s;e, it was pre&s;umed, he dur&s;t not have looked up to his Ma&s;ter's Daughter. So here ended all her Pride; all her Re&s;erves came to this! Her Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s of others, redoubled People's Contempts upon her|&s;elf, and made nobody pity her. She was, finally, turn'd out of Doors, without a Peny of Fortune: The Fellow was forced to &s;et up a Barber's Shop in a Country Town; for all he knew, was to &s;have, and dre&s;s a Peruque; and her Papa would never look upon her more: So that <HI>Prudiana</HI> became the Out|ca&s;t of her Family, and the Scorn of all that knew her; and was forced to mingle in Conver&s;ation and Company, with the Wretches of her Husband's Degree!</P>
<P>Poor, mi&s;erable <HI>Prudiana!</HI> &s;aid Mi&s;s.&mdash;What a &s;ad, &s;ad Fall was hers!&mdash;And all owing to the want of a proper Education too!&mdash;And to the Lo&s;s of &s;uch a Mamma, as I have an Aunt, and &s;o wi&s;e a Papa, as I have an Uncle!&mdash;How could her Papa, I wonder, re&s;train her Per&s;on as he did, like a poor Nun, and make her unacquainted with the gene|rous Re&s;traints of the Mind?</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, my dear good Aunt, it will be owing to you, that I &s;hall never be a <HI>Coquetilla,</HI> nor a <HI>Prudiana</HI> neither. Your Table is always &s;urrounded with the be&s;t of Company, with worthy Gentlemen as well as Ladies; and you in&s;truct me to judge of both, and of every new Gue&s;t, in &s;uch a manner, as makes me e&s;teem them all, and cen&s;ure nobody; but yet to &s;ee Faults in &s;ome to avoid, and Graces in others to imitate; but in nobody but Your&s;elf and my Uncle, any thing &s;o like Perfection, as &s;hall at|tract one's Admiration to one's own Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="462">You are young yet, my Love, and mu&s;t always doubt your own Strength; and pray to God, more and more, as your Years advance, to give you more and more Prudence, and Watchfulne&s;s over your Conduct.</P>
<P>But yet, my Dear, you mu&s;t think ju&s;tly of your|&s;elf too; for let the young Gentlemen be ever &s;o learned, and di&s;creet, your Education intitles you to think as well of your&s;elf, as of them: For, don't you &s;ee, the Ladies who are &s;o kind to vi&s;it us, that have not been abroad, as you have been, when they were young, yet make as good Figures in Conver&s;ation, &s;ay as good things, as any of the Gen|tlemen? For, my Dear, all that the Gentlemen know more than the Ladies, except here and there &s;uch an one as your dear Uncle, with all their learned Education, is only, that they have been <HI>di&s;ciplin'd</HI> perhaps, into an Ob&s;ervation of a few Accuracies in Speech, that, if they know no more, rather di&s;tin|gui&s;h the <HI>Pedant,</HI> than the <HI>Gentleman:</HI> Such as the avoiding of a fal&s;e Concord&punc; as they call it, and which you know how to do, as well as the be&s;t; not to put a <HI>was</HI> for a <HI>were,</HI> an <HI>are</HI> for an <HI>is,</HI> and to be able to &s;peak in Mood and Ten&s;e, and &s;uch like valuable Parts of Education: So that, my Dear, you can have no Rea&s;on to look upon that Sex in &s;o high a Light, as to depreciate your own: And yet you mu&s;t not be proud nor conceited neither; but make this one Rule your Guide:</P>
<P>In your <HI>maiden State,</HI> think your&s;elf <HI>above</HI> the Gentlemen, and they'll think you &s;o too, and ad|dre&s;s you with Reverence and Re&s;pect, if they &s;ee it is not arrogant Pride, but a con&s;cious Merit, a true Dignity, &s;uch as becomes Virgin Mode&s;ty, and untainted Purity of Mind and Manners, like that of an Angel among Men; for &s;o young Ladies
<PB N="462" REF="463">
&s;hould look upon them&s;elves to be, and will then be treated as &s;uch by the other Sex.</P>
<P>In your <HI>marry'd State,</HI> which is a kind of State of Humiliation for a Lady, you mu&s;t think your&s;elf &s;ubordinate to your Hu&s;band; for &s;o it has plea&s;ed GOD to make us. You mu&s;t have no Will of your own, in <HI>petty</HI> Things: And if you marry a Gentleman of Sen&s;e and Honour, &s;uch an one as your Uncle, he will look upon you as his Equal; and will exalt you the more, for your aba&s;ing your|&s;elf.&mdash;In &s;hort, my Dear, he will act by you, ju&s;t as your dear Uncle does by me: And then, what a happy Creature will you be!</P>
<P>So I &s;hall, Madam! To be &s;ure I &s;hall!&mdash;But I know I &s;hall be happy whenever I marry, becau&s;e I have &s;uch wi&s;e Directors, and &s;uch an Example before me: And if it plea&s;e GOD, I will never think of any Man, (in pur&s;uance of your con&s;tant Advice to young Ladies at the Tea-table) who is not a Man of Sen&s;e, and a virtuous Gentleman. But now, dear Madam, for your next Character. There are Two more yet to come, that's my Plea|&s;ure! I wi&s;h there were Ten!</P>
<P>Why the next was PROFUSIANA, you remem|ber, my dear Love. <HI>Profu&s;iana</HI> took another Cour&s;e to <HI>her</HI> Ruin. She fell into &s;ome of <HI>Coquet|illa</HI>'s Foibles, but pur&s;u'd them for another End, and in another Manner. Struck with the Grandeur and Magnificence of what weak People call the <HI>Upper Life,</HI> &s;he gives her&s;elf up to the Circus, to Balls, to Operas, Ma&s;querades, and A&s;&s;embl&eacute;es; affects to &s;hine at the Head of all Company, at <HI>Tun|bridge,</HI> at <HI>Bath,</HI> and every Place of publick Re&s;ort; plays high, is always receiving and paying Vi&s;its, giving Balls, and making Treats and Entertain|ments; and is &s;o much <HI>above</HI> the Conduct which
<PB N="463" REF="464">
mo&s;tly recommends a young Lady to the E&s;teem of the De&s;erving of the other Sex, that no Gentleman, who prefers &s;olid Happine&s;s, can think of addre&s;&s;ing her, tho' &s;he is a fine Per&s;on, and has many out|ward Graces of Behaviour. She becomes the fa|vourite Toa&s;t of the Places &s;he frequents, is proud of that Di&s;tinction; gives the Fa&s;hion, and delights in the Pride, that &s;he can make Apes by Imitation, whenever &s;he plea&s;es: But yet, endeavouring to avoid being thought proud, makes her&s;elf cheap, and is the Subject of the Attempts of every Coxcomb of Eminence; and with much ado, pre&s;erves her Vir|tue, tho' hardly her Character.</P>
<P>What, all this while, is poor <HI>Profu&s;iana</HI> doing? She would be glad, perhaps, of a &s;uitable Propo&s;al, and would, it may be, give up &s;ome of her Gaieties and Extravagancies; for <HI>Profu&s;iana</HI> has Wit, and is not totally abandon'd of Reflection, when &s;he &s;uffers her&s;elf to think. But her Conduct procures her not one &s;olid Friend&s;hip, and &s;he has not in a Twelvemonth, among a thou&s;and Profe&s;&s;ions of Ser|vice, one Devoir that &s;he can attend to, or a Friend that &s;he can depend upon. All the Women &s;he &s;ees, if &s;he excels them, hate her; the gay Part of the Men, with whom &s;he accompanies mo&s;t, are all in a Plot again&s;t her Honour. Even the Gentle|men, who&s;e Conduct in the general is govern'd by Principles of Virtue, come down to the&s;e publick Places to partake of the innocent Freedoms allowed there, and oftentimes give them&s;elves Airs of Gal|lantry, and never have it in their Thoughts to com|mence a Treaty of Marriage, with an Acquaintance begun upon that gay Spot. What &s;olid Friend&s;hips and Satisfactions then is <HI>Profu&s;iana</HI> excluded from?</P>
<P>Her Name indeed is written in every publick Window, and pro&s;tituted, as I may call it, at the
<PB N="464" REF="465">
Plea&s;ure of every Profligate, or Sot, who carries a Diamond to ingrave it: And that, it may be, with mo&s;t vile and barbarous Imputations and Freedoms of Words, added by Rakes, who very probably ne|ver exchang'd a Syllable with her. The wounded Trees are perhaps taught al&s;o to wear the Initials of her Name, linked, not unlikely, and widening as they grow, with tho&s;e of a Scoundrel. But all this while, &s;he makes not the least Impre&s;&s;ion upon one noble Heart: And at la&s;t, perhaps, having run on to the End of an uninterrupted Race of Follies, &s;he is cheated into the Arms of &s;ome vile Fortune-hunter; who quickly lavi&s;hes away the Remains of that Fortune which her Extravagance had left; and then, after the wor&s;t U&s;age, abandoning her with Contempt, &s;he &s;inks into an Ob&s;curity, that cuts &s;hort the Thread of her Life, and leaves no Remem|brance, but on the brittle Gla&s;s, and more faithful Bark, that ever &s;he had a Being.</P>
<P>Alas! alas! what a Butterfly of a Day, &s;aid Mi&s;s&mdash;an Expre&s;&s;ion &s;he remembered of Lady <HI>Towers</HI>'s&mdash;was poor <HI>Profu&s;iana!</HI>&mdash;What a &s;ad thing to be &s;o dazled by worldly Grandeur, and to have &s;o many Admirers, and not one real Friend!</P>
<P>Very true, my Dear; and how carefully ought a Per&s;on of a gay and lively Temper to watch over it! And what a Rock may publick Places be to a Lady's Reputation, if &s;he be not doubly vigilant in her Conduct, when &s;he is expo&s;ed to the Cen&s;ures and Ob&s;ervations of malignant Crouds of People; many of the wor&s;t of whom, &s;pare the lea&s;t, tho&s;e who are mo&s;t unlike them&s;elves!</P>
<P>But then, Madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s, would <HI>Profu&s;iana</HI> venture to play at publick Places? Will Ladies game, Madam? I have heard you &s;ay, that Lords, and Sharpers but ju&s;t out of Liveries, in Gaming, are
<PB N="465" REF="466">
upon a Foot in every thing, &s;ave that one has nothing to lo&s;e, and the other much, be&s;ides his Reputation? And will Ladies &s;o di&s;grace their Characters, and their Sex, as to pur&s;ue this pernicious Diver&s;ion in publick?</P>
<P>Yes, my Dear, they will, too often, the more's the Pity! And don't you remember when we were at <HI>Bath,</HI> how I hurried you by &s;ome Knots of genteel People, and you a&s;ked, What tho&s;e were doing? I told you, whi&s;peringly, They were Game|ing; and loth I was, that my Mi&s;s <HI>Goodwin</HI> &s;hould &s;top to &s;ee &s;ome Sights, to which, till &s;he arrived at Years of Di&s;cretion, it was not proper to familiarize her Eye; in &s;ome &s;ort acting like the antient <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> who would not a&s;&s;ign Puni&s;hments to certain atrocious Crimes, becau&s;e they were &s;uch Friends to human Nature, as to &s;uppo&s;e it incapable of com|mitting them: So I was not for having you, while a little Girl, &s;ee tho&s;e things, which I thought, when you grew older, &s;hould be new and &s;hocking to you: But now you are &s;o much a Woman in Di&s;|cretion, that I may tell you any thing.</P>
<P>She ki&s;s'd my Hand, and made me a fine Cour|te&s;y&mdash;And told me, That now &s;he long'd to hear of <HI>Prudentia</HI>'s Conduct. <HI>Her</HI> Name, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, promi&s;es better things, than tho&s;e of her Three Companions; and &s;o it had need: For how &s;ad is it to think, that out of Four Ladies of Di&s;tinction, Three of them &s;hould be naughty, and, <HI>of cour&s;e,</HI> unhappy&mdash;The&s;e two Words, <HI>of cour&s;e,</HI> my Dear, &s;aid I, were very prettily put in: Let me ki&s;s you for them: Since every one that is naughty, fir&s;t or la&s;t, mu&s;t be <HI>certainly</HI> unhappy.</P>
<P>Far otherwi&s;e than what I have related, was it with the amiable PRUDENTIA. Like the indu&s;tri|ous Bee, &s;he makes up her Honey-hoard from every
<PB N="466" REF="467">
Flower, bitter as well as &s;weet; for every Character is of U&s;e to her, by which &s;he can improve her own. She had the Happine&s;s of an Aunt, who loved her, as I do you, and of an Uncle, who doted on her, as yours does: For, alas! poor <HI>Prudentia</HI> lo&s;t her Papa and Mamma almo&s;t in her Infancy, in one Week: But was &s;o happy, in her Uncle and Aunt's Care, as not to mi&s;s them in her Education, and but ju&s;t to remember their Per&s;ons. By Reading, by Ob|&s;ervation, and by Attention, &s;he daily added new Advantages to tho&s;e which her Education gave her. She &s;aw and pitied the fluttering Freedoms and dan|gerous Flights of COQUETILLA. The &s;ullen Pride, the Affectation, and &s;tiff Re&s;erves which PRUDI|ANA a&s;&s;umed, &s;he penetrated, and made it her Study to avoid. And the gay, hazardous Con|duct, extravagant Temper, and Love of tin&s;ell'd Grandeur, which were the Blemi&s;hes of PROFU|SIANA's Character, &s;he dreaded, and &s;hunn'd. She fortifies her&s;elf with the excellent Examples of the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent Ages, and knows how to avoid the Faults of the Faulty, and to imitate the Graces of the mo&s;t perfect. She takes into her Scheme of that future Happine&s;s, which &s;he hopes to make her own, what are the <HI>true</HI> Excellencies of her Sex, and endeavours to appropriate to her&s;elf the dome|&s;tick Virtues, which &s;hall one Day make her the Crown of &s;ome worthy Gentleman's earthly Hap|pine&s;s; and which, <HI>of cour&s;e,</HI> as you prettily &s;aid, my Dear, will &s;ecure and heighten her own.</P>
<P>That noble Frankne&s;s of Di&s;po&s;ition, that &s;weet and unaffected Openne&s;s and Simplicity, (all uncon|&s;cious of Art or De&s;ign in her&s;elf, and undreading it from others, but yet her Prudence ever wakeful, and on its Guard) which &s;hine in all her Actions and Behaviour, commend her to the E&s;teem and
<PB N="467" REF="468">
Reverence of all Mankind; as her Humility and Affability, and a Temper uncen&s;orious, and ever making the be&s;t for the ab&s;ent Per&s;on, of either Sex, do to the Love of every Lady. Her Name in|deed is not pro&s;tituted on Windows, nor carved on the Barks of Trees in publick Places and Walks: But it &s;mells &s;weet to every delighted No&s;tril, dwells on every prai&s;eful Tongue, and is ingraved on every admiring Heart. She meets with no Addre&s;s but from Men of Honour and Probity: The fluttering Coxcomb, the inveigling Para&s;ite, the in&s;idious Deceiver, the mercenary Fortune-hunter, &s;pread no Snares for a Heart guarded by Di&s;cretion and Pru|dence, as hers is. They &s;ee, that all her amiable Vir|tues are the happy Re&s;ult of an uniform Judgment, and the Effects of her own Wi&s;dom, founded in an Education to which &s;he does the highe&s;t Credit. And at la&s;t after &s;everal worthy Offers, enough to perplex any Lady's Choice, &s;he ble&s;&s;es &s;ome one happy Gentleman, more di&s;tingui&s;h'd than the re&s;t, for Learning, good Sen&s;e, and <HI>true Politene&s;s,</HI> which is but another Word for <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI>; and &s;hines, to her la&s;t comfortable Hour, in all the Duties of dome&s;tick Life, as an excellent Wife, Mother, Mi&s;tre&s;s, Friend, and Chri&s;tian; and &s;o confirms all the Expectations of which her Maiden Life had given &s;uch &s;trong and &s;uch edifying Pre&s;ages.</P>
<P>Then folding my dear Mi&s;s in my Arms, and ki&s;&s;ing her, Tears of Plea&s;ure &s;tanding in her pretty Eyes, Who would not, &s;aid I, &s;hun the Examples of the COQUETILLA's, the PRUDIANA's, and the PROFUSIANA's of this World, and chu&s;e to imi|tate the Character of PRUDENTIA!&mdash;the Happy, and the Happy-making PRUDENTIA!</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="469">O Madam!

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>ALtho' it will be &s;een, and confe&s;s'd, (notwith|&s;tanding the Sheets, which compo&s;e the&s;e Two additional Volumes, might have been ea&s;ily formed into Three) how difficult it was to reduce Mate|rials &s;o ample within the Compa&s;s which the Editor had a&s;&s;igned them; yet, being unwilling to de&s;erve a Su&s;picion, that the Extent of this Work was to be mea&s;ur'd but by the Patience of its Readers, He thinks proper to conclude in this Place: Subjoining, in order to elucidate the Whole, a brief Note of the following Facts.</P>
<P>That Mr. <HI>B.</HI> continued (after the Affair that took Date at the Ma&s;querade, and &s;o happily con|cluded) to be one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t exemplary of Men, an Honour to his Country, both in his pub|lick and private Capacity, having, at the In&s;tances of &s;ome of his Friends, in very elevated Stations, accepted of an honourable Imployment abroad in the Service of the State; which he di&s;charged in &s;uch a manner, as might be expected from his Qualifica|tions, and Knowlege of the World: And on his Return, after an Ab&s;ence of Three Years, re&s;i&s;ting all the Temptations of Ambition, devoted him&s;elf to his privater Duties, and join'd with his excellent Lady in every pious Wi&s;h of her Heart: Adorning the married Life with all the Warmth of an elegant Tenderne&s;s: Beloved by his Tenants, re&s;pected by his Neighbours, rever'd by his Children, and almo&s;t ador'd by the Poor, in every County where his E&s;tates gave him Intere&s;t, as well for his own boun|tiful Temper, as for the Charities which he per|mitted
<PB N="470" REF="471">
to be di&s;pen&s;ed, with &s;o liberal a Hand, by the Repre&s;entative of his Heart, his dear Lady.</P>
<P>That &s;he made him the Father of Seven fine Chil|dren, Five Sons, and Two Daughters, all adorn'd and accompli&s;h'd by Nature, to be the Joy and Delight of &s;uch Parents; being educated, in every re&s;pect, by the Rules of their inimitable Mother, in that Book which &s;he mentions to have written for the Revi&s;al and Correction of her Con&s;ort; the Con|tents of which may be gather'd from her Remarks upon Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Treati&s;e of Education, in her Letters to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and in tho&s;e to Lady <HI>G.</HI></P>
<P>That Mi&s;s GOODWIN, at the Age of Eighteen, was marry'd to a young Gentleman of fine Parts, and great Sobriety and Virtue: And that both &s;he and her Spou&s;e, in every material Part of their Con|duct, and in their Behaviour to one another, emu|lated the great and good Examples &s;et them by Mr. and Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>That Lord DAVERS dying Two Years before this Marriage, his Lady went to re&s;ide at the Hall in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> the Place of her Birth, that &s;he might enjoy the Company and Conver&s;ation of her excel|lent Si&s;ter; who, for Conveniency of the Chapel, and Advantage of Room and Situation, had prevail'd upon Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to make that the chief Place of his Re&s;idence; and there the noble Lady lived long (in the &s;tricte&s;t Friend&s;hip with the happy Pair) a re&s;olv'd and an honourable Relict of her affectionate Lord.</P>
<P>That the worthy Mr. ANDREWS, and the happy good Woman his Wife, lived together in the calm, con&s;cious Sweetne&s;s, &s;et forth in their Letters, for the Space of Twelve Years, at the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Farm; where the good old Gentlewoman then died fir&s;t, full of Comfort and Years, her duti|ful
<PB N="471" REF="472">
Daughter performing the la&s;t pious Offices to &s;o beloved and &s;o loving a Parent: Her Hu&s;band &s;ur|viving her about a Year only.</P>
<P>That Lady <HI>G.</HI> Mi&s;s DARNFORD that was, after a happy Marriage of &s;everal Years, died in Childbed of her Fourth Child; to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Concern of her affectionate Con&s;ort, and of her dear Friend Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>That Mr. LONGMAN liv'd to a great Age in the worthy Family, much esteemed by every one, having trained up a diligent Youth, whom he had recommended, to ea&s;e him in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and who, an&s;wering Expectation, &s;ucceeded him in it.</P>
<P>That, at la&s;t, dying rich, out of his great Love and Gratitude to the honourable Family, in who&s;e Service he had acquir'd mo&s;t of his Fortune, and in Di&s;gu&s;t to his neare&s;t Relations, who had per|ver&s;ely di&s;oblig'd him, he bequeath'd to Three of them One hundred Pounds apiece, and left all the re&s;t to his honoured Principal Mr. <HI>B.:</HI> Who, as &s;oon as he came to know it, being at that Time abroad, directed his Lady to call together the Relations of the old Gentleman; and, after touching them to the Heart with a ju&s;t and effectual Reproof, when &s;he found them fill'd with due Sen&s;e of their Demerit, which had been the Cau&s;e of their &s;uffering, then to divide the Whole, which had been le&s;t him, among them, according to their Proximity of Blood: An Action worthy of &s;o generous and ennobled a Spi|rit; and which procured him the Prayers and Ble&s;|&s;ings, not only of the Benefited, but of all who heard of it. For it is ea&s;y to imagine, how chear|fully and how gracefully his benevolent Lady di&s;|charged a Command &s;o well &s;uited to her natural Genero&s;ity.</P>

<P>THERE being Rea&s;on to apprehend, from the former Attempts of &s;ome Imitators, who, &s;up|po&s;ing the Story of PAMELA a Fiction, have murder'd that excellent Lady, and mi&s;taken and mi&s;repre&s;ented other (&s;uppos'd imaginary) CHA|RACTERS, that Per&s;ons may not be wanting, who will impo&s;e new Continuations upon the Publick:</P>
<P>It is with a View to &s;ome De&s;igns of this Nature, that the Editor (who is &s;orry to find himself under a Nece&s;&s;ity of declaring di&s;agreeable Truths, and who both hates and would avoid all Occa&s;ion of Offence or Reflection) gives this publick A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by way of Prevention, That all the Copies of Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s Ob|&s;ervations and Writings, upon every Subject hinted at in the preceding Four Volumes, and in particu|lar tho&s;e relating to <HI>Devotion, Education, Plays,</HI> &amp;c. are now in <HI>One Hand Only:</HI> And that, <HI>if ever</HI> they &s;hall be publi&s;hed, (which at pre&s;ent is a Point undetermined) it mu&s;t not be, till after a certain Event, as unwi&s;hed, as deplorable: And <HI>then,</HI> &s;olely, at the A&s;&s;ignment of SAMUEL RICHARDSON, <HI>of Salisbury-Court, Fleet&s;treet,</HI> the Editor of the&s;e Four Volumes of <HI>PAMELA</HI>; or, VIRTUE REWARDED.</P>
