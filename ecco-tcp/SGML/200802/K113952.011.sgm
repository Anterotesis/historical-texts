<L>SEcure o'er the meadow, the valley, and grove,</L>
<L>My &s;teps in a &s;weet rural innocence rove;</L>
<L>All ea&s;e in my bo&s;om, nor mine is the care,</L>

<L>E'er my wi&s;hes I &s;peak, every want is &s;upplied,</L>
<L>And how can I err&mdash;when the Lord is my guide!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By the hand of indulgence each day am I ble&s;s'd,</L>
<L>And am lull'd every night on the pillow of re&s;t:</L>
<L>When hungry, my &s;hepherd his votary leads</L>
<L>To the banquet of nature, that &s;miles on the meads;</L>
<L>And commands, when I'm thir&s;ty, my fever to cea&s;e</L>
<L>With pure living &s;treams from the fountain of peace.</L>

<L>Thus calmly I wander the journey of life,</L>

<L>THE Lord is my &s;hepherd, my guardian, and guide;</L>
<L>What&s;oever I want he will kindly provide;</L>
<L>Ever &s;ince I was born, it is he that hath crown'd</L>
<L>The life that he gave me with ble&s;&s;ings all round:</L>
<L>While yet on the brea&s;t a poor infant I hung,</L>
<L>E'er time had unloo&s;en'd the &s;trings of my tongue,</L>
<L>He gave me the help which I could not then a&s;k;</L>
<L>Now therefore to thank him &s;hall be my tongue's ta&s;k.</L>
<L>Thro' my tendere&s;t years, with as tender a care,</L>
<L>My &s;oul, like a lamb, in his bo&s;om he bare;</L>
<L>To the brook he would lead me, whene'er I had need,</L>
<L>And point out the pa&s;ture where be&s;t I might feed:</L>
<L>No harm could approach me; for he was my &s;hield</L>
<L>From the fowls of the air, and the bea&s;ts of the field;</L>
<L>The wolf, to devour me, would oftentimes prowl,</L>
<L>But the Lord was my &s;hepherd, and guarded my &s;oul.</L>
<L>How oft, in my youth, have I wander'd a&s;tray?</L>
<L>And &s;till he hath brought me back to the right way!</L>
<L>When, lo&s;t in dark error, no path I could meet,</L>
<L>His word, like a lantern, hath guided my feet:</L>
<L>What wondrous e&s;capes to his kindne&s;s I owe!</L>
<L>When, ra&s;h and unthinking, I &s;ought my own woe:</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="118">My &s;oul had, long &s;ince, been gone down the deep,</L>
<L>If the Lord had not watched, when I was a&s;leep.</L>
<L>When&s;oe'er, at a di&s;tance, he &s;ees me afraid,</L>
<L>He &s;kips o'er the mountain, and comes to my aid;</L>
<L>Then leads me back gently, and bids me abide</L>
<L>In the mid&s;t of his flock, and feed clo&s;e by his &s;ide:</L>
<L>How &s;afe in his keeping, how happy and free,</L>
<L>Could I always remain where he bids me to be;</L>

<L>The fold it is full, and the pa&s;ture is green;</L>

<L>A &s;weet &s;melling &s;avour ince&s;&s;antly breathe:</L>
<L>The delight is renew'd of each &s;en&s;ible thing,</L>
<L>And beheld in their bloom all the beauties of &s;pring.</L>
<L>Or, if a quite different &s;cene he prepare,</L>
<L>And we march thro' the wilderne&s;s barren and bare;</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="119">By his wonderful works, we &s;ee plainly enough,</L>
<L>That the earth is the Lord's, and the fulne&s;s thereof:</L>
<L>If we hunger, or thir&s;t, and are ready to faint,</L>
<L>A relief in due &s;ea&s;on prevents our complaint:</L>
<L>The rain, at his word, brings us food from the &s;ky,</L>
<L>And rocks become rivers when we are adry.</L>
<L>From the fruitfulle&s;t hill to the barrene&s;t rock,</L>

<L>And the flock, in return, the Lord always confe&s;s</L>

<L>With a cheerful regard, we attend to his ways,</L>
<L>Our attention is prayer, and our cheerfulne&s;s prai&s;e.</L>
