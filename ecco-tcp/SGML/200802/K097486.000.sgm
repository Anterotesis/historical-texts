<P>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A <HI>PROTESTING CATHOLIC DISSENTER,</HI> AND A <HI>CATHOLIC</HI>; ON THE NATURE, TENDENCY AND IMPORT OF THE OATH LATELY OFFERED TO THE CATHOLICS OF ENGLAND.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Dialogue, it is hoped, may be of &s;ome &s;ervice, to many well meaning Catholics. We are called upon to take an oath, which our pa&s;tors have pronounced <HI>inadmi&s;&s;ible.</HI> Their &s;entence is called in que&s;tion. An appeal has been made to the Catholics at large, <HI>again&s;t the cen&s;ure of the Bi&s;hops;</HI> the grounds of this appeal have been repeatedly of|fered to the public. It will not then be improper to &s;tate the rea&s;ons again&s;t the oath, that an impar|tial public may have every information nece&s;&s;ary to form a judgment. A Dialogue was thought the mo&s;t candid method of examining the merits of the cau&s;e; for therein, the unbia&s;&s;ed reader may weigh the grounds of both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and &s;ix his principles accordingly. It will ea&s;ily be di&s;co|vered to whom the author wi&s;hes victory, but he is not con&s;cious of having omitted any rea&s;on of weight, on the other &s;ide, or of propo&s;ing any of them, in a weak manner.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;heets would have been offered to the pub|lic, &s;ome time back, had they not been with-held,
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
from an apprehen&s;ion of augmenting di&s;cord, and widening the fatal breach, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, at pre|&s;ent, among Engli&s;h Catholics. It was &s;aid that time and reflection would cool the ardour of pro|te&s;ting Catholic Di&s;&s;enters, as they are plea&s;ed to &s;tile them&s;elves, and that they would, in time, aban|don a plan, which they found reprobated, by a great majority of the body, if they were not rendered ob|&s;tinate, by re&s;i&s;tance. This expectation is now prov|ed vain. The pamphlets, which every day appear, in defence of the favourite &s;y&s;tem, are a clear proof, that nothing le&s;s than the mo&s;t re&s;olute oppo&s;ition can reclaim them to their duty. The complexion of the&s;e pamphlets is a demon&s;tration again&s;t the cau&s;e, in favour of which they are printed. If a &s;y&s;tem cannot be defended, but on the grounds of &s;chi&s;m and here&s;y; it can not be orthodox. The two fir&s;t, which appeared, dated <HI>Moorfields,</HI> breathe throughout in&s;ult and outrage again&s;t our worthy Prelates, and the Vicar of Chri&s;t. The fir&s;t, in particular, contains doctrines evidently heretical, condemned as &s;uch, by univer&s;ities, Popes and Councils. The direct object of the la&s;t publication is a &s;chi&s;matical &s;eparation from the See of Rome.</P>
<P>The author of the&s;e &s;heets had prepared for the pre&s;s a full confutation of the Layman's letter, on the election of Bi&s;hops: but he found the work done, by abler hands. Mr. Plowden has refuted this Layman, in a ma&s;terly manner, though not &s;o fully, as could be wi&s;hed, from a per&s;on &s;o well qua|lified for the undertaking. Mr. Millner however
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
has followed the Layman through all the mazes of his mangled quotations; and effectually driven him from every po&s;t.</P>
<P>What &s;till remains to be done is, to &s;hew this Layman and others &s;ome of the rights of the Prima|cy. He and many others have &s;o long been atten|tive to what the Pope <HI>is not,</HI> that they forget <HI>what he is.</HI> It may not therefore be ami&s;s to inform them. It is worth remarking that this Layman &s;eems to bear no greater re&s;pect to a General Council, than he does to his Holine&s;s: In his note, page 9. he a&s;&s;erts that the Canons of the Council of Trent give too great an authority to the Pope: we &s;hall next be told that this Council has e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>a lamentable abu&s;e, which has disfigured the religion of Chri&s;t.</HI> What could Luther have added to this?</P>
<P>That Chri&s;t our Redeemer gave to St. Peter the power of the Keys, Matth. xvi. and committed to him the care of his flock, John xxi. are go&s;pel truths: That the Roman Pontiff &s;ucceeded to this power and care is a fact equally admitted, by all &s;ucceeding ages. This is evident from the unanimous con&s;ent of Councils and Fathers: nor does this Layman, <HI>as yet,</HI> &s;eem to deny it. Here then we are agreed. But his opinion about the extent of the&s;e powers is <HI>a di&s;&s;ent</HI> from Catholic doctrine. I &s;hall then &s;hew him &s;ome few unexceptionable vouchers, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h the Catholic doctrine of the Primacy, beyond a reply. I &s;hall not produce tho&s;e authorities, which only prove the Roman Pontiff to be Primate or fir&s;t Bi&s;hop in the Church; this he will not deny: but &s;uch
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
only as have &s;ome connection with the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, and &s;hew that this power is extended much farther, than this Layman is aware of.</P>
<P>In the definition of faith, of both Greeks and La|tins, in the Council of Florence, is the following pa&s;&s;age: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We define that the holy Apo&s;tolical See, and the Roman Pontiff, holds the primacy over the whole world: and that the Roman Pontiff is the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of B. Peter the Prince of the Apo|&s;tles, and the true vicar of Chri&s;t, the head of the whole Church, and that he is the father and teacher of all Chri&s;tians: and that, to him, in the per&s;on of Peter, was granted, by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, a full power of feeding, directing and go|verning the whole Church; as is contained in the acts of general councils, and the &s;acred ca|nons."</Q> The <HI>ordinary juri&s;diction</HI> therefore of the See of Rome extends as wide as the Church it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>This remark is almo&s;t in &s;o many words defined in the fifth council of Lateran.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Roman Church, by the appointment of our Lord, holds the primacy of ordinary power over all others."</Q> (churches.)</P>
<P>Not to tire this Layman's patience, with quota|tions from Councils and Fathers, I &s;hall only add a few from among the French, who&s;e authority will be of greater weight, as they are the le&s;s &s;u&s;pected of giving <HI>too great authority to the Pope, as the Council of Trent has done.</HI> In the a&s;&s;embly of the Gallican Clergy 1681, it is &s;aid of the Pope: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he
<PB N="v" REF="6">
is the head of the Church and the centre of unity: he holds over us the primacy of autho|rity and juri&s;diction, committed to him by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the per&s;on of St. Peter: whoever di&s;&s;ents from the truth, would be a &s;chi&s;matic, and even an heretic."</Q></P>
<P>In 1728, the 4th of January, the &s;ame Clergy &s;peaking of the power of Bi&s;hops, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Je&s;us Chri&s;t by his own appointment, has pre&s;cribed limits to this power, which he has granted to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles; this he has &s;ubjected to the Chair of St. Peter, where he has placed the plenitude of apo&s;tolic authority."</Q></P>
<P>In 1657, they had almo&s;t tran&s;lated the words of the Council of Florence, which they quoted, and then they proceed; who that is orthodox can doubt, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but that he (the Pope,) by this quality, of Pri|mate, in ca&s;es and according to the forms of Law, can provide for (or in&s;pect over) the government of every Dioce&s;e, and all the pa&s;toral functions, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the good of &s;ouls."</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps Mr. Bo&s;&s;uet will weigh as much in this Layman's opinion, as any author on the earth: let us then hear him (Lett. des Card. Archev. &amp; Eveq. edit. 1728, page 56.) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A power, which is given to many, carries its own re&s;triction, by its being divided; whereas the power given to only one, (St. Peter) and over all others, and without excep|tion carries with it a plenitude of power: not being divided, with any other, it has no limits but the&s;e which are fixed, by rule. For this rea&s;on
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
our ancient Doctors of Paris . . . . with one voice, have always acknowledged, in the Chair of Peter, the fullne&s;s of apo&s;tolic authority: this point is decided and fini&s;hed. They only demanded, that the exertions of this authority &s;hall be regu|lated, by the Canons; that is, by the common laws of the whole Church."</Q> And again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thou art a rock, and on this rock I will build my Church; and I will give thee the Keys of the kingdom of heaven. Thou, who ha&s;t the autho|rity of preaching the faith, &s;halt al&s;o have the Keys, which denote the authority of govern|ment. Whatever thou &s;halt bind on earth, &s;hall be bound in heaven; and whatever thou &s;halt loo&s;e on earth &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven. All is &s;ubjected to the&s;e Keys: the king and his people; the pa&s;tors and their flocks. We publi&s;h it with joy; becau&s;e we love unity, our obedience is our boa&s;t. The command of loving more than other Apo&s;tles, was fir&s;t given to Peter, then that of feeding and governing all, the lambs and the &s;heep; the young and their mothers, the Pa&s;tors them&s;elves. Pa&s;tors with regard to the people, but &s;heep in relation to Peter, in whom they honour Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</Q> I &s;hall fini&s;h with one more quotation from the Gallican Clergy, in the before mentioned collection, page 53.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is nece&s;&s;ary, according to the Catholic faith, to acknowledge in the &s;overeign Pontiff, a pri|macy of honour and juri&s;diction al&s;o, as has been acknowledged, from the fir&s;t ages of the
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
Church. This juri&s;diction is not barely of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical right; it is of divine right, by the in&s;ti|tution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. A juri&s;diction, in virtue of which, the decrees of the &s;overeign Pontiff concern all the Churches, and each one in par|ticular; and each of the Bi&s;hops con&s;iders it as one of his mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential duties to re&s;pect the Pope as his &s;uperior, to &s;wear obedience to him to have recour&s;e to his authority, in &s;o many occa&s;ions, and to be &s;ubject to him, according to canonical ordination."</Q></P>
<P>From all the&s;e I find, that the &s;overeign Pontiff holds, by the expre&s;s appointment of Chri&s;t, a pri|macy not only of honour and pre-eminence, but of juri&s;diction al&s;o: in virtue of which he is the ordi|nary univer&s;al Pa&s;tor of all the faithful in the Church, whether Laity, Clergy, or Bi&s;hops. He has then a right, inherent in his office, of preaching, teaching, and governing, in every &s;piritual concern, the whole Chri&s;tian world: and every Chri&s;tian is bound to &s;ubmit, to his mandates, in matters of religion. This juri&s;diction is not limited or con|fined, but by the Canons of the Church, even according to the principles of the Gallican Church, which never yet prevaricated, <HI>as the Council of Trent did.</HI> Now to make this doctrine more explicit, in the pre&s;ent debate, I &s;hall point out nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equences admitted, by French Divines, as prive|leges, inherent in the primacy. I hope Dr. Hook will &s;uffice for the re&s;t, as he cannot be &s;u&s;pected of granting any one prerogative to the Pope, which
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
he did not think of divine origin. Had this Lay|man ever read the Doctor's Pricipia, I pre&s;ume he would not have advanced &s;o many errors.</P>
<P>Vol. 3. page 409. His propo&s;ition is,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Roman Pontiff, in virtue of the Primacy, can and ought, to watch with authority, over the ob&s;ervance and propagation of the Catholic faith, and the execution of the canons and cu&s;toms ap|pertaining to univer&s;al di&s;cipline: this how|ever with dependence on the whole order of Pa&s;tors."</Q></P>
<P>Page 411, Corol. 1. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Roman Pontiff, by virtue of his primacy, is the centre of Catholic communion."</Q></P>
<P>Page 413, Corol. 2. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Therefore the Roman Pontiff has, in the Church, a <HI>legi&s;lative, executive, and judiciary</HI> power; and his deci&s;ions concern|ing faith and univer&s;al di&s;cipline, pronounced ac|cording to the u&s;ual forms required by the canons, have the force of law; unle&s;s, through the oppo|&s;ition of the Bi&s;hops, they &s;hould not be accepted, and thus be aboli&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P>On this head the Doctor has, ibidem.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If a controver&s;y ari&s;es about faith, the &s;overeign Pontiff has a right, 1. to declare what is preci&s;ely the Catholic doctrine, in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y; and to condemn the doctrine, which is contrary to Catholic faith. 2. He has al&s;o a right to approve of tho&s;e doctrines which are con&s;i&s;tent with Ca|tholic faith, although they do not appertain to faith it&s;elf; and to condemn tho&s;e which are not
<PB N="ix" REF="10">
conformable to faith. 3. He has a right to approve of tho&s;e forms of &s;peech (expre&s;&s;ions) which are con&s;onant to faith; and to condemn tho&s;e which are not."</Q></P>
<P>N.B. We have heard much rea&s;oning, in fa|vour of the oath, becau&s;e it is not contrary to faith: as if nothing but direct faith it&s;elf &s;hould be attend|ed to. The Doctor goes on, page 415. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If a con|trover&s;y ari&s;es about di&s;cipline, the Roman Pon|tiff has a right, 1. to declare which canons or cu&s;toms are received, by the practice of all the churches; and to condemn tho&s;e, who will not ob&s;erve &s;uch canons and cu&s;toms. 2. To condemn or re&s;cind whatever is done, or introduced among Chri&s;tians, which <HI>he judges</HI> not con&s;i&s;tent with faith or Catholic di&s;cipline. 3. He can ordain or command whatever he thinks nece&s;&s;ary or greatly conducive to the execution of the canons, or the pre&s;ervation of faith."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In a word, the Roman Pontiff, <HI>as Primate of the Church,</HI> can enact decrees, in all tho&s;e concerns, which are &s;ubject to the deci&s;ions of the Church: all the&s;e things not only <HI>evidently follow from the (foregoing) conclu&s;ion, but are moreover confirmed, by perpetual practice:</HI> it would carry me too far to produce examples."</Q></P>
<P>Page 422. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cor. 3. The Roman Pontiff, in vir|tue of the Primacy, can receive appeals from all particular &s;entences concerning faith and general di&s;cipline; and in facts which might injure either."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="11">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Corol. 5. The Roman Pontiff, in virtue of the Primacy, can validly di&s;pen&s;e with the execution of the general canons, received in all the churches; when a &s;ufficient rea&s;on demands it; but not without cau&s;e, at his bare will and plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>Page 420. He expre&s;sly mentions the right of &s;ending legates, or appointing vicars of his pontifical authority.</P>
<P>I do not wi&s;h to &s;well this preface with unnece&s;&s;ary comments, on the&s;e plain words. A denial of any one right, <HI>evidently inherent in the Primacy,</HI> is to deny the Primacy it&s;elf; and con&s;equently heretical. Let any one judge, from this, what &s;entence &s;hould be pronounced, on the late publications, in favour of the oath. Should any future occa&s;ion require it, this &s;ubject &s;hall be treated more at large.</P>
<P>I expect to be called to an account for publi&s;hing the&s;e &s;heets; for, it will be &s;aid, the&s;e publications only irritate mens minds, and make ill wor&s;e. To this I &s;hall an&s;wer, in the words of the late worthy Archbi&s;hop of Paris, quoted, by the Cardinal Arch|bi&s;hop of Mechlin, in his declaration of la&s;t year: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is therefore true that Popes and Councils, Bi|&s;hops of the mo&s;t eminent &s;anctity, and the mar|tyrs have always reclaimed again&s;t the laws of &s;ilence, which confound truth with error. Laws favorable to here&s;y, but pernicious to religion: laws which are an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of per&s;e|cution and in&s;ults again&s;t Catholies; becau&s;e the attention, to enforce &s;uch laws, is always &s;ixt up|on the faithful, but leaves heretics at liberty to
<PB N="xi" REF="12">
violate them with impunity."</Q> We are advi&s;ed to be &s;ilent: but are our adver&s;aries &s;ilent? Have we not had a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of incendiary publica|tions, to the great &s;candal of religion, and the mani|fe&s;t danger of a &s;chi&s;m in the Church. It is high time to repell the&s;e dangerous attacks; and I hope to &s;ee every Catholic, who has talents to defend his religion, &s;tep forth and &s;hew to the world, that nei|ther the fear of lo&s;ing the favour of the great, nor even threats of per&s;ecution, can deter him from the defence of truth and orthodoxy.</P>
<P>Should it be &s;aid that I ought to have &s;ub&s;tituted an oath, in place of that of the Committee, which would &s;atisfy all parties: I an&s;wer, that, however ea&s;y the ta&s;k, it is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of a private per|&s;on; this &s;hould be done, by the Bi&s;hops. Let them be con&s;ulted, and without doubt they will &s;oon com|po&s;e our differences, and &s;atisfy government al&s;o, if the heads of admini&s;tration only wi&s;h to &s;ecure our allegiance. If any thing more is demanded, it &s;hould not be granted.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.C.D.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE pre&s;ent di&s;putes, about the oath of allegiance, have rai&s;ed &s;trange commotions through|out the kingdom, among the Catholics. I fear we &s;hall be a divided people. Pray, Sir, let you and I di&s;cu&s;s the matter together, perhaps we may clear the difficulty, by explaining our meaning.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h &s;omething of this &s;ort had been done &s;ome time back. I am per&s;uaded that a can|did and calm di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this bu&s;ine&s;s would have prevented the Committee from proceeding, with any thing, which they apprehended to be wrong; and on the other hand, would have en&s;ured the hearty concurrence of the Bi&s;hops, in every thing, where the rights of religion and con&s;cience were left un|touched. What can be done in the pre&s;ent &s;tage
<PB N="2" REF="14">
of the bu&s;ine&s;s, I do not know; but am very willing to di&s;cu&s;s the matter with you, provided that no har&s;hne&s;s or a&s;perity be admitted in our conver|&s;ation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed. Invectives embitter the heart, but never enlighten the mind. However I think it will be nece&s;&s;ary to advert occa&s;ionally to the conduct of the Bi&s;hops; as you, perhaps, may do, to that of the Committee; to point out the errors of either, with|out acrimonious cen&s;ures of their intentions, will not injure their characters, and may &s;erve to di&s;cover truth. I &s;incerely wi&s;h the Bi&s;hops had not been &s;o very intractable; they have, almo&s;t from the begin|ning, refu&s;ed to treat with the Committee; and this is the &s;ole cau&s;e of our pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps that may be true: but I believe the Bi&s;hops did not know how to to proceed, with &s;afety. They had, after all, &s;ome rea&s;ons to look on the pro|ceedings of the Committee, with a jealous eye. I fancy eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory will not furni&s;h a &s;ingle example of a &s;imilar nature. They are confe&s;&s;edly the guardians of religion, according to the in&s;titu|tion of Chri&s;t, and we are bound to hear and obey them, in matters of religion; the Committee there|fore were cen&s;urable, fir&s;t in attempting to impo&s;e an oath on the Catholics, without the previous ap|probation of the Bi&s;hops; 2dly, in attempting to &s;upport their proceedings again&s;t the po&s;itive cen|&s;ure the Bi&s;hops had jointly publi&s;hed: for although the two Bi&s;hops, from whatever motives, did not publi&s;h the Circular letter, in their re&s;pective di|&s;tricts,
<PB N="3" REF="15">
yet, it is well known, that the &s;aid letter was originally agreed to, by all four a&s;&s;embled. Now I wi&s;h to know, in what hi&s;tory we hear of any thing of the kind, in pa&s;t ages: either as to the attempt originally, or, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> where the attempt had been oppo&s;ed by the po&s;itive cen&s;ure of the Bi&s;hops.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Committee had proceeded, with calm|ne&s;s, under a clear conviction of doing good, and rendering e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the Catholic body. They had moreover two Bi&s;hops, and one of the mo&s;t learned eccle&s;ia&s;tics in the kingdom, at their head, they had the Prote&s;tation to guide them, which was &s;igned by the be&s;t heads and hearts in the nation; hence they framed an oath, &s;trictly conformable to the tenor of the prote&s;t, and never had a thought that it would be objected to. The two Bi&s;hops and the learned Doctor, their fellow members, had approved of the oath; and &s;till ap|prove of it, at lea&s;t the two &s;urviving per&s;ons. But the Bi&s;hops met, and cen&s;ured the oath as inadmi&s;|&s;ible, in general terms, without a&s;&s;igning any rea|&s;on. What could the Committee do, but write an apology, both to the Bi&s;hops them&s;elves and the Catholics at large? For although the Bi&s;hops are the natural guardians of religion, yet they are not the tyrants of their &s;ubjects. The Committee there|fore had an undoubted right to explain them&s;elves, to the Catholics of England, and to reque&s;t the Bi|&s;hops to re-con&s;ider the ca&s;e, and to in&s;i&s;t on know|ing their rea&s;ons for &s;o ra&s;hly cen&s;uring an oath,
<PB N="4" REF="16">
which was no more than a civil te&s;t of allegiance, in which they had no right to interfere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>This brings us to a very &s;erious debate, and which can not be managed &s;o well by a general an|&s;wer: if you plea&s;e, we will divide the &s;ubject, and treat the different parts &s;eparately. Let us then con&s;ider fir&s;t the article of the Prote&s;tation. 2. The right of the Bi&s;hops to cen&s;ure the oath without a&s;|&s;igning their rea&s;ons for &s;o doing; the Committee's appeal to the nation will be hinted at under the &s;e|cond head; you will &s;ee, that we &s;hall be obliged to examine whether the oath is a mere te&s;t of civil allegiance, or a religiou oath. I would not willing|ly enter upon a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the merits or talents of the three eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who were members of the Committee; we are to try the merits of the cau&s;e, even again&s;t the per&s;ons who &s;upported it: and therefore their authority, however great, is out of the que&s;tion. I could wi&s;h however that we &s;hould previou&s;ly di&s;cu&s;s the propriety of the title: <HI>Prote&s;t|ing Catholic Di&s;&s;enter:</HI> this comes in order, before the other heads, and, if you have no objection, we will examine if even this title it&s;elf be admi&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I willingly accept the challenge, both as to the divi&s;ion of the matter, and to the previous di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the title. We &s;hall then have another debate on the oath it&s;elf; for I wi&s;h to clear up every difficulty concerning the whole affair. I can|not however conceive what unea&s;ine&s;s the title &s;hould create. We are under legal re&s;trictions,

<P>It was a remark worthy of the Right Rev. Dr. Challoner, that it is no di&s;grace to the Church of Chri&s;t to be called, by any opprobrious appellations, by her rebellious children; this ever has, and will ever be the ca&s;e: but it is a &s;ure mark of here&s;y or &s;chi&s;m, when any body of Chri&s;tians adopt a di&s;tinc|tive appellation, different from their holy mother. The word Catholic, according to the doctrine of the Fathers, has ever been a mark of the true Church; and has always di&s;criminated her from every &s;et of &s;ectaries. To abandon this, or to adopt a new ap|pellation, is to allow that we do not belong to the true Church, but are really a new &s;ect. I will ven|ture to &s;ay, if the&s;e affairs go on, that the word Ca|tholic will &s;oon be left out of your title; then you will only be Prote&s;ting Di&s;&s;enters. <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> is a nick-name impo&s;ed upon us; this title is a&s;&s;umed by our&s;elves; the Committee have told us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that on the propriety of its invention, and its probable efficacy, the merits of this plan chiefly re&s;ts."</Q> It is then an appellation, a nick-name adopted, by them&s;elves: not impo&s;ed upon them, and would &s;oon, in fact, as in name, &s;eparate them from the
<PB N="6" REF="18">
great body of the Catholic Church. This Church will never admit, as its members, any per&s;ons, who give up her ancient hereditary &s;irname, and adopt a new denomination. If then our Legi&s;lators are &s;till &s;o far worked up, by their prejudices, or &s;o weak, as to fear popular commotions, that they will not grant us redre&s;s of our grievances, on any other terms; we ought to &s;ubmit to providence, and wait, with patience, for better times, rather than &s;hamefully di&s;grace our&s;elves, by &s;ubmitting to humiliating con|de&s;cen&s;ions, beneath the dignity of men, of Citi|zens, of Chri&s;tians and Catholics.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can not &s;ee this title in that light. We certainly are prote&s;ting again&s;t certain pernicious doctrines attributed to us: we belong to the great body of the Catholic Church: and we certainly di&s;&s;ent, or differ from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church: We are then Prote&s;ting Catholic Di&s;&s;enters. We can not expect that the legi&s;lature will grant us relief on our own terms: if this name in our &s;tatute books &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of that odious ap|pellation of Papi&s;t, where is the harm? After all, though the Committee have agreed to the appella|ion, it is not their own act and deed; they could not obtain relief on any other conditions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plea&s;e to recollect that the Committee were not bound to &s;eek relief; and therefore if it were not to be obtained, but on too hard conditions, the matter &s;hould have re&s;ted there. It is therefore &s;trictly true that this title is their own; and, as I remarked before, they glory in the invention. But Sir, though
<PB N="7" REF="19">
I grant we are prote&s;ting, yet I do not under&s;tand the addition of Di&s;&s;enters. There is a great di&s;|parity between <HI>differ</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;ent,</HI> in matters of religion. You may differ in opinion from one man, or from all the world: the word imports neither <HI>priority</HI> nor <HI>majority:</HI> but the word <HI>di&s;&s;ent</HI> implies both; you cannot then di&s;&s;ent from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, as a Catholic. Every &s;ect is a di&s;&s;ent from the Catholic Church: &s;he di&s;&s;ents from no other Church; &s;he cannot therefore adopt this title. How then can you, if you remain a Catholic? You have moreover a proof, from the Committee's letter to the Catholics, that they are leaning towards a &s;epa|ration from the Church, by dividing them&s;elves from its members. You recollect that the probable efficacy of this title depends intirely on the &s;up|po&s;ition, that Prote&s;ting Catholic Di&s;&s;enters are not of the &s;ame belief, with tho&s;e per&s;ons, who are always di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;tile and title of Papi&s;ts, in our penal &s;tatutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, Papi&s;ts are tho&s;e, who hold doc|trines, again&s;t which, we prote&s;t. Doctrines inimical to Civil government, and who, of cour&s;e, are not worthy of protection. The penal laws are enacted again&s;t &s;uch per&s;ons, and in my opinion very ju&s;tly. I am quite of the opinion of our Committee, that the pre&s;ent oath will &s;hew who are Papi&s;ts, and who are not, and tho&s;e who are, and dare avow them|&s;elves, let them meet their de&s;erts, in the execution of the laws. I can &s;ee no harm in &s;eparating from
<PB N="8" REF="20">
&s;uch per&s;ons, whom I con&s;ider as mon&s;ters in &s;ociety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is har&s;h indeed. You con&s;ented to my propo&s;al, that no a&s;perity &s;hould be admitted in our conver&s;ation. I have often heard that language, but never without horror. I allow that the penal laws are enacted again&s;t per&s;ons called Papi&s;ts. I allow al&s;o that Prote&s;tants, in general, mi&s;repre&s;ent them, as holding doctrines incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the &s;tate. But I po&s;itively deny that the penal &s;tatutes were either enacted again&s;t &s;uch only, who avowed tho&s;e doctrines, or on account of holding them. The &s;tatutes &s;peak for them&s;elves. They are again&s;t the doctrines of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, invo|cation of &s;aints and other articles of our creed. They are again&s;t Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits, again&s;t being reconciled to the Church of Rome, &amp;c. &amp;c. not a word, that I remember, of tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed doctrines of reputed Papi&s;ts. And although Prote&s;tants have generally &s;uppo&s;ed all Papi&s;ts to be dangerous &s;ubjects, this idle &s;uppo&s;ition &s;hould be traced to its proper &s;ource, the venom and hatred, which the enemies of the Church have ever entertained again&s;t its members: and &s;hould be treated with the &s;ame contempt, as the &s;landers of the Pagans during the ten per&s;ecutions. Indeed, Sir, you mu&s;t know well, that mo&s;t of the doctrines again&s;t which we prote&s;t, never were the opinions of any number of Catholics in the world. Moreover the infallibility of the Pope and his indirect power, in &s;ome extra|ordinary ca&s;es, over their temporal authority, which
<PB N="9" REF="21">
I think, are the only doctrines that have been maintained, by tho&s;e, whom you &s;tile Papi&s;ts, are no part of their religion: no more than the denial of the&s;e doctrines is a part of your own. Why then would you wi&s;h to &s;eparate from them? Did any one of them hold the re&s;t of the doctrines abjured, by the oath, he would neither be Catholic nor Papi&s;t, even according to the new fa&s;hioned interpre|tation of the word. In fine, Sir, the penal &s;tatutes are enacted again&s;t tho&s;e, who profe&s;s the Catholic religion, whether they do or do not hold any of the doctrines, which you prote&s;t again&s;t. The pre&s;ent oath is a bad criterion to di&s;cover tho&s;e, whom you &s;tile Papi&s;ts; as, &s;hould it pa&s;s into a law, every one who refu&s;es to take it, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be &s;tigma|tized as a Papi&s;t, though he &s;hould abjure every one of tho&s;e doctrines, as &s;incerely and heartily as your&s;elf. Now, Sir, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert that a great majority of the Catholics in England will refu&s;e to take this captious, equivocal oath. Though perhaps not one in a thou&s;and maintains any of the doctrines abjured by it: and although no one Catholic &s;hould maintain any of the doctrines, which are, even con&s;tructively, contrary to the &s;afety of the &s;tate. Thus, Sir, you wi&s;h to &s;eparate, not only from real Papi&s;ts, as you call them, which I firmly believe do not exi&s;t, only in the brain of the Com|mittee, but even from per&s;ons, who are as good &s;ubjects and <HI>better</HI> Catholics than your&s;elf: you moreover wi&s;h to &s;ee the &s;word of per&s;ecution once more un&s;heathed again&s;t them; and by &s;upporting
<PB N="10" REF="22">
the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, as much as depends on you, you imbrue your hands in all the innocent blood, that may be &s;hed on that account. I think, Sir, it would redound more to the credit of the Committee to abandon the cau&s;e, which mu&s;t produce a di|vi&s;ion fatal to religion, if no wor&s;e comes of it, than ob&s;tinately to per&s;evere in the mea&s;ure, again&s;t the po&s;itive commands of the Bi&s;hops, and again&s;t the inclinations and wi&s;hes of &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the body.</P>
<P>To &s;um up all this. We were happy and content: but if the Committee, on honourable terms, could have procured a <HI>relaxation</HI> or repeal of the laws, which, as yet, are in force again&s;t Catholics, we &s;hould have acknowledged our obligation; but I fear this new appellation is neither honourable nor &s;afe. It &s;hould not then have been adopted, or &s;ubmitted to. It can never &s;erve as a criterion to di&s;cover real Papi&s;ts; it is both a fal&s;e title, and an u&s;ele&s;s, nay a pernicious expedient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed hard for any con&s;cientious per|&s;ons to be involved in the di&s;agreeable dilemma, of taking the oath again&s;t their con&s;ciences: or being reputed Papi&s;ts for refu&s;ing it: but after all, it is their own faults. They &s;igned the prote&s;tation; the Committee had every right to &s;uppo&s;e, that they would &s;wear to what they had &s;igned. The Com|mittee had drawn up an oath according to the tenor of the prote&s;t, with very few additions or alterations, the&s;e trivial in them&s;elves and required by the heads
<PB N="11" REF="23">
of admini&s;tration: thus they were compelled to abide by the oath, or forfeit their credit as men of honour, by revoking their &s;ignatures to the prote&s;tation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is harder &s;till that this dilemma &s;hould be the con&s;equence of mea&s;ures adopted and pur&s;ued by the Committee. Their own rules pre&s;cribed that nothing of any con&s;equence, regarding the generality of Catholics, &s;hould be done, without the approbation of a previous general meeting. A pe|tition from the North was pre&s;ented to them, re|que&s;ting that nothing, which concerned religion, &s;hould even be treated of, without the concurrence of the Vicars Apo&s;tolic. This drew a declaration from the noble chairman, at a &s;ub&s;equent meeting, that nothing of the kind had been, or would in future be done, without their con&s;ent and appro|bation. They have therefore infringed their own rules, have exceeded the limits of their delegated power, and broken their own promi&s;es: and thus have involved them&s;elves and us in a very di&s;agree|able &s;ituation. Either they mu&s;t commit them&s;elves to the Mini&s;try, by abandoning the project, to &s;atisfy tho&s;e, who refu&s;e to take the oath; or they mu&s;t throw a great number of con&s;cientious Catho|lics into the far wor&s;e dilemma ju&s;t mentioned. I do not he&s;itate to &s;ay that the former is the more generous, and what, I think, they are &s;trictly bound to. The prote&s;tation is no plea in their favour. From its internal evidence, and from the means made u&s;e of to bring it about, it is an in|&s;trument,
<PB N="12" REF="24">
which can never authori&s;e the pre&s;ent proceedings, nor give &s;anction to the oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? Sir. But this brings us to the &s;econd part according to the divi&s;ion we agreed upon: or rather the fir&s;t part, as, thus far we have only been di&s;cu&s;&s;ing preliminaries. If the oath does not differ from the prote&s;tation; how can we refu&s;e it? As to the means you mention, I am not acquainted with any improper ones. The prote&s;t was framed by Prote&s;tants, they had offered their objections again&s;t our principles, in as much as they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be inimical to Civil government; they had al&s;o an&s;wered the&s;e objections, in terms, which they deemed &s;atisfactory to government, and to the na|tion. This compo&s;ition, entirely their own, was pre&s;ented to the Committee; the&s;e Gentlemen, after &s;ome alterations, approved of it, pre&s;ented it to the Clergy, in a numerous meeting, who all &s;igned it; and it was afterwards &s;igned, by all the Clergy and Gentry in the nation, with very few exceptions; if we recede from this, we &s;hall really prove what Prote&s;tants object again&s;t us; that nothing will bind us, that we will not abide by any prote&s;tations or oaths what&s;oever; for I &s;ee no difference between one and the other; I &s;hould make no &s;cruple of &s;wearing to any deed or in&s;trument, to which I had &s;igned my name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under favour, Sir, there was another tri|bunal to which this matter &s;hould have been referred, previous to the approbation of the Committee. The Bi&s;hops &s;hould have taken the lead. It belongs to
<PB N="13" REF="25">
their province to approve religious doctrines, or to abjure and renounce fal&s;e ones. Then indeed the Committee would have had &s;ome plea for their &s;ub|&s;equent proceedings: but they fir&s;t gave their fiat, and then endeavoured to bar out alterations. How|ever there is a great difference between an oath and a prote&s;tation.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under favour, Sir, you, in your turn, do not ob&s;erve the bounds of moderation agreed on between us. What in&s;inuations you throw out! What were tho&s;e means and endeavours you &s;peak of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the Committee were convinced that the prote&s;t could and ought to be &s;igned, but appre|hending that &s;ome per&s;ons, from &s;cruples, others from too much zeal for &s;chola&s;tic accuracy, would object again&s;t it; hence they made u&s;e of means, which they thought effectual, and which proved &s;uch, to elude every argument, and obtain the &s;ig|natures of the meeting, without any alterations. The&s;e were as follows: Letters were &s;ent to corre|&s;pondents in the country to di&s;po&s;e the minds of the Clergy and Gentry: they were informed that the prote&s;t had been agreed to, by every one, object|ed to, by no one; and this, when <HI>no one</HI> knew that &s;uch a thing exi&s;ted, except them&s;elves, and a very few of their confidents. Then a meeting was called of a cho&s;en few of the clergy, about twelve in num|ber, at which the Secretary to the Committee pre|&s;ided. The be&s;t part of the&s;e gentlemen, already in the &s;ecret, being gained over, were to engage the re&s;t, to e&s;pou&s;e the good cau&s;e. Objections were
<PB N="14" REF="26">
&s;tarted again&s;t the wording of it; the an&s;wers were; that the prote&s;t was a bare abjuration of the perni|cious doctrines, which prote&s;tants fal&s;ely imputed to us; that it was only a declaration of our civil alle|giance, which had no connection with religious te|nets, &s;tated in the objections; and finally that no alteration would be admitted. Nothing of all this however could &s;atisfy one of the characters pre&s;ent, till they agreed to &s;ign an explanatory prote&s;t, in which they declared the &s;en&s;e, in which it was pre|&s;ented, in which them&s;elves under&s;tood and &s;igned it. As this explanation had done away the difficul|ties of tho&s;e, who oppo&s;ed the prote&s;tation, they all &s;igned it, and by this, were bound to &s;upport it, in the general meeting of the Clergy held &s;oon after. In this meeting, the &s;ame means were made u&s;e of, per&s;ons were employed to &s;ound and per&s;uade the leading characters, who invariably a&s;&s;erted that no oath would be exacted, that no alteration would be &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The meeting was then opened by the right reve|rend Pre&s;ident. The Secretary of the Committee read the con&s;ultations of the univer&s;ities, which were foreign to the purpo&s;e, not one of their an|&s;wers having any reference to what was objected again&s;t the prote&s;t. Then a &s;ort of explication was read which was con&s;idered, by many, as introduced to intimidate, and enforce the Gentlemen to &s;ub|&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Several however did object, not again&s;t the gene|neral tenor of the prote&s;t; but again&s;t the wording
<PB N="15" REF="27">
of it; not again&s;t renouncing any doctrine, con&s;i|&s;idered as pernicious, or inimical to civil govern|ment, but again&s;t the terms in which they were ab|jured. They thought that the abjuration of tho&s;e doctrines was done in &s;uch loo&s;e, inaccurate, ambi|guous and equivocal terms, that &s;ound doctrines, as well as pernicious were equally rejected, that truth as well as fal&s;ehood were equally renounced, or might con&s;tructively be abjured and rejected, accord|ing to the plain, common and natural &s;en&s;e of the words of the prote&s;tation. Then again the u&s;ual an&s;wers. None of the abettors of the prote&s;t pre|tended to call in que&s;tion the principles of religion, which the oppo&s;ers of it held forth as injured, by it; but they contended, that the prote&s;t went no farther than to &s;ecure our civil allegiance, by re|nouncing the doctrines, which were con&s;idered as incon&s;i&s;tent with the rights of government, that the preamble declared it &s;uch, that the meaning of the fra|mers of it was &s;uch; and finally that no alteration would be admitted. A third declaration, from the Chair, <HI>that we were not called together to examine and di&s;|cu&s;s, but to &s;ign,</HI> put an end to the debate; and all pre&s;ent &s;igned it on that day, or the next; and &s;oon after great part of the Clergy and Laity in the na|tion followed the example, by &s;igning them&s;elves, or <HI>&s;ome one &s;igning for them.</HI> I have heard and read of &s;uch proceedings among Arians, Iconocla&s;ts, Jan|&s;eni&s;ts, &amp;c. but never among Catholics.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ee how you can complain of the Committee. They are not an&s;werable for what
<PB N="16" REF="28">
others may do. They intended an open meeting, a free and candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the matter; if this was hindered, by the Pre&s;ident, he is to blame; but after all, how came you to let your&s;elves be drawn in, if you di&s;approved of the mea&s;ure? you &s;hould have &s;tood out like men. You &s;igned however and are bound by your &s;ignatures. If you retract, you fall under the ju&s;t cen&s;ure of Prote&s;tants; ca&s;t an odium on the tenets of your religion, and hinder the Catholics from emancipating them&s;elves from the pre&s;&s;ure of the penal laws.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not indeed think, that all the members of the Committee were engaged in the&s;e mea&s;ures: I think that &s;everal knew nothing of them. But &s;ure|ly &s;ome of them &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e mea&s;ures to per&s;ons whom they thought proper to conduct them: The fact is, they were practi&s;ed. The character of the Pre&s;ident renders this beyond a doubt, that he ne|ver would have proceeded in the manner he did, if he had not been tampered with. In this ca&s;e the per&s;on, who drew him into the &s;nare, is more to blame than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t &s;tanding out; I own they were to blame in giving a &s;anction to what might be made an ill u&s;e of. But &s;wayed as they were, by &s;uch an appearance of eandour, on the one hand, &s;uch plau|&s;ible explications, and po&s;itive a&s;&s;everations of the meaning of the prote&s;t, on the other; then again the great authority which awed them, it is no won|der that they fell into the &s;nare, They had no &s;u&s;|picions of intrigue or deceit, and hone&s;tly thought
<PB N="17" REF="29">
them&s;elves authori&s;ed to &s;ign a declaration of their principles, in a modified &s;en&s;e, as they thought; but which was the real &s;en&s;e of the prote&s;t, according to the abettors of it, notwith&s;tanding they allowed that it was loo&s;ely and inaccurately worded. It was, on all hands, agreed, that the principles of religion &s;hould remain untouched, and that the doctrines, abjured in the prote&s;t, were pernicious, except the infallibility of the Pope, which we &s;hall examine hereafter: it was al&s;o agreed, by the abettors of the prote&s;t, that the &s;en&s;e in which the oppo&s;ers &s;igned, was the only &s;en&s;e in which they them&s;elves could con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;et their names to it. The&s;e me|thods have often &s;ucceeded, in other occa&s;ions; and once were employed with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t a Council of about 300 Bi&s;hops. I dare not even think that the &s;ame malevolent intention guided the promoters of the prote&s;t; but it &s;eems to have had the &s;ame effect, thus far, and &s;hews how we ought to guard again&s;t every &s;pecies of novelty, even in u&s;ing new words to expre&s;s our ideas, in matters of religious import. This I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that, if the matter had been fairly and candidly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the prote&s;t would never have pa&s;&s;ed without &s;everal alterations, to ren|der it both clear and accurate, for as it &s;tands, it is neither one nor the other. In the pre&s;ent &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s, it &s;eems that we are pledged to take the oath, by having &s;igned the prote&s;t. This is certainly a mi&s;take; for it is well known, that &s;everal have retracted their &s;ignatures; on account of the ill u&s;e that has been made of them, and becau&s;e they are
<PB N="18" REF="30">
apprehen&s;ive that the &s;en&s;e, in which they &s;igned, is not the plain and obvious &s;en&s;e of the words, as they were told it was. The&s;e cannot take the oath, But even tho&s;e who have not retracted their &s;igna|tures, can not be bound to take the oath. For, as I &s;aid, there is a great difference.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Previous to that di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, pray reflect on the difficulties and danger of &s;upporting that doctrine. How will Prote&s;tants ever give credit even to our oaths, if we retract our &s;ignatures &s;o &s;olemnly pledg|ed? What can they think of our principles and our practice? How can we hope for redre&s;s of our grievances, if we confirm them, in one of the wor&s;t of their prejudices again&s;t us, that no oaths can bind us. Fir&s;t an&s;wer this, and then I will attend to your proceeding with what you have twice at|tempted, excu&s;e the interruption.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Prote&s;tants are candid, they will applaud us, and condemn you. They will &s;ee that we retract, not becau&s;e we think our oaths or promi&s;es do not bind us, but becau&s;e we fear that we have ra&s;hly, though hone&s;tly &s;igned an in&s;trument, which we ought not to have &s;igned. Not that we approve of any of the pernicious doctrines abjured in the pro|te&s;t; but becau&s;e we fear le&s;t the loo&s;e and cap|tious terms, in which they are abjured, &s;hould, either by implication or directly involve the principles of religion. They mu&s;t then approve of our conduct. But they will &s;ee that undue influence has been u&s;ed to procure &s;ub&s;criptions, and the &s;u&s;picion will fall heavy on the Committee and their abettors, they will

naturally infer that &s;uch per&s;ons are ready to &s;wal|low any oaths, to get indulgences, acquire the rights of citizens, &amp;c.

<P>It can not be &s;uppo&s;ed that Prote&s;tants will condemn us for &s;tanding to our &s;ignatures. But let me hear what difference you find between an oath and a prote&s;tation.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>They differ widely. I may &s;ign my name to a prote&s;tation, <HI>as an opinion.</HI> But I can not &s;wear to an opinion. In a prote&s;tation I may pa&s;s over tri|vial inaccuracies of the framer; in an oath, I mu&s;t have the nice&s;t accuracy, in the wording of it. In a prote&s;tation I may admit an accommodated mode of expre&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially if it is the declared &s;en&s;e of the author; in an oath, this would be perjury, if we &s;wear to the plain, natural and obvious &s;en&s;e of the words. For an accommodated &s;en&s;e, is certain|ly an expo&s;ition foreign to the natural import of the terms. The preamble may &s;ix the &s;en&s;e of a prote&s;t, but can not fix that of an oath.</P>

<P>It would go beyond the limits of our plan to treat this &s;ubject at large. Plea&s;e to refre&s;h your memory with your former ideas on the con&s;tant doctrine of the Church, in her approved divines, and I believe you will find that ju&s;tice, judgment and truth, which have ever been thought nece&s;&s;ary conditions of a lawful oath, will go to prove the conditions I require: moreover an oath &s;tands upon its own ground, without any reference to a preamble, or to any accommodated &s;en&s;e of the propo&s;er; and therefore no preamble can affect the intrin&s;ic merits of it; and where the &s;trict and natural &s;en&s;e of the words is &s;worn to, any accommodated &s;en&s;e, unle&s;s it were known and agreed to, would be a mental re&s;triction; which is not ju&s;ti&s;iable in any oath what&s;oever.</P>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>As this is only a conver&s;ation, on amicable terms, between us, I wi&s;h not to pu&s;h this matter any further, at pre&s;ent; we may both find it worth our while to look over the treati&s;e <HI>De juramento,</HI> in &s;ome approved Divine, and have another di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject, on &s;ome future occa&s;ion. I think we may here leave the &s;ubject of the prote&s;tation; as to its intrin&s;ic merits, we &s;hall occa&s;ionally advert to them, when we come to di&s;cu&s;s the oath. Let us therefore pa&s;s to the &s;econd article, of our propo&s;ed plan; the right of the Bi&s;hops to cen&s;ure the oath, <HI>in globo,</HI> without a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on for &s;o doing; we have a right to know their rea&s;ons, and they are bound to give them, in a <HI>tone of &s;obriety.</HI> I &s;ay ra|ther
<PB N="21" REF="33">
they had no righr at all to <HI>interfere,</HI> as the oath is a mere civil te&s;t of allegiance, no ways connected with religion: and therefore by no means &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hops.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, this is &s;trange language, and which I never expected to have heard from any one, who pretends to be a Catholic. I always under&s;tood, by the article of my creed, <HI>the holy Catholic Church,</HI> that the Bi&s;hops are con&s;tituted and appointed, as our fathers in religion, to in&s;truct, govern and direct us, in the paths of faith and virtue, and that we are bound to hear and obey them in matters appertain|ing to their charge. It was therefore the duty of the Bi&s;hops to con&s;ider whether the oath left the rights of religion untouched; on this they met, and de|cided in the negative. It was then the duty of their flock to &s;ubmit; at lea&s;t till their &s;entence &s;hould be rever&s;ed, by a &s;uperior tribunal: but it appears that you Gentlemen Di&s;&s;enters do not wi&s;h to ap|peal to Rome; but to the Catholics of England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that right in the Bi&s;hops, they are bound to give their rea&s;ons. They are our fathers, but not our ma&s;ters; they are appointed to <HI>feed us,</HI> as the Greek text has it, but they are not authori&s;ed to domineer over us; much le&s;s <HI>to fleece or butcher us.</HI> We are not bound to blind obedience; and therefore we in&s;i&s;t on knowing what harm the oath will do to religion; this they will not, dare not, or can not tell us. We complain of this: and appeal to our fellow Catholics, by explaining our conduct and our motives, that they may all &s;ee how injuri|ou&s;ly
<PB N="22" REF="34">
we are treated. I &s;ay, <HI>we,</HI> for I mo&s;t heartily approve of the Committee's letter. We &s;hall not appeal to ultramontane principles, for the deci&s;ion of a cau&s;e, to which we think our&s;elves perfectly competent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant that Bi&s;hops are fathers, not tyrants, that they are appointed to feed us, if you will, for I can &s;ee no difference; how can they &s;eed us, unle&s;s we are bound to boey? You &s;eem to allow a &s;ort of obedience, but will not &s;ubmit blindly. So far I agree. But pray who is to decide between a Bi&s;hop and his flock? According to the original appoint|ment of Bi&s;hops, they are the guardians of religion, they are to guide their flocks into &s;alutary pa&s;tures, and point out the poi&s;onous weeds, which they occa|&s;ionally meet with; thus far is their duty; the man|ner how they are to perform it, is left to their di&s;|cretion. They are not to exerci&s;e a haughty and im|perious command over their &s;ubjects; but this ought never to be &s;uppo&s;ed, much le&s;s urged again&s;t them, without manife&s;t rea&s;ons, which admit of no doubt. They are an&s;werable to God for their conduct; but not to their flocks. It is true we are not bound to blind obedience; i. e. to &s;ubmit again&s;t the dictates of rea&s;on: but where &s;hall we &s;ix the limits? If we are always to in&s;i&s;t upon their giving rea&s;ons for their conduct, we &s;hall &s;oon do away their autho|rity: If we are to be the judges of their proceed|ings, then we are their &s;uperiors. An appeal from them to the public at large, in that ca&s;e, would be legal and proper. But I dare a&s;&s;ert that there never
<PB N="23" REF="35">
has been a &s;chi&s;m in the Church, no re&s;i&s;tance ever happened to epi&s;copal authority, which would not be ju&s;tifiable on the &s;ame grounds. Let the abettors of any &s;chi&s;matical divi&s;ion only appeal from the au|thority of Bi&s;hops to the public, or rather to their own judgment, and then the epi&s;copal authority will be &s;ubjected to the private judgment of every capri|cious innovator. Pray, Sir, what has the refor|mation done more?</P>
<P>In one word. The Bi&s;hops, though &s;uperiors, have no right to exact unlimitted and blind obedi|ence. But neither have their flocks an unlimited right to examine and decide on the exerci&s;e of their authority. Now, by your leave, Sir, I will point out the land mark, which was originally fixed, and firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the great founder of our reli|gion, and which has ever been acknowledged, by all true Catholics from the fir&s;t foundation of Chri|&s;tianity. Every Bi&s;hop is a competent judge of controver&s;y to his flock, and they are bound to &s;ubmit to his deci&s;ion, in every ca&s;e, what&s;oever, unle&s;s, 1&s;t. his deci&s;ion is evidently wrong; or 2d. unle&s;s his &s;entence &s;hould be rever&s;ed, by a &s;uperior court; and to this court, you frankly own, you dare not appeal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I to clo&s;e with you on your own terms, I &s;hould &s;till have good grounds to a&s;&s;ert that the Bi|&s;hops are in the wrong, and therefore we are not obliged to &s;ubmit to their deci&s;ion. I apprehend that even your&s;elf, Sir, will require two conditions, in the &s;entence emanent from Epi&s;copal authority, without which, it will never have the force of law:
<PB N="24" REF="36">
the 1&s;t. that the Bi&s;hops &s;hall proceed with calmne&s;s and deliberation, and not pronounce finally, till they have duly weighed and properly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject in debate: the 2d. that the matter it&s;elf &s;hall be &s;ubjected to their authority, and not purely of a temporal nature; for otherwi&s;e, any &s;entence of Bi&s;hops would be out of the province of their juri&s;|diction; and of no force whatever: now, Sir, as to the fir&s;t condition; it is very well known <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Bi&s;hops, on their arrival in London, were vi&s;ibly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they did not con&s;ult any individual in London, and proceeded without the lea&s;t deli|beration or di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to cen&s;ure indi&s;criminately the bill, the prote&s;tation and the oath; whereas, in &s;trict ju&s;tice, nothing ought to have been the &s;ubject of their deliberations, but that part of the oath, which differs from the prote&s;tation."</Q> As to the &s;econd condition, I &s;hall beg leave to ob&s;erve, that, as the oath is barely a te&s;t of Civil allegiance, that, religion is no ways concerned in it, only in as much as we are called upon to abjure tho&s;e perni|cious tenets, which our adver&s;aries have fal&s;ely attributed to our religion, it does not appertain to the juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hops: and therefore their cen&s;ure is null and void, for want of competency in the judges; even if they had proceeded with that calmne&s;s and deliberation, which becomes their dig|nity, and which, I ob&s;erved, they did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admit your two conditions; but you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that there are certain degrees of deliberation and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, <HI>not all,</HI> equally nece&s;|&s;ary in every controver&s;y. Sometimes the que&s;tion
<PB N="25" REF="37">
is ob&s;cure and perplexed; on other occa&s;ions it is clear and obvious: The Bi&s;hops, therefore, are to proceed with calmne&s;s, and that nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which the matter requires: and here again they only are competent to judge, when they have taken the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps for information. Every inno|vator, the mo&s;t daring heretic, from the &s;ame principle, might call in que&s;tion the deci&s;ions of every Bi&s;hop, and every general Council from the origin of Chri&s;tianity, till this day: he has only to &s;ay that they did not proceed with all the caution nece&s;&s;ary on the occa&s;ion, and therefore the deci|&s;ion is informal; whether given by four Vicars Apo&s;tolic, or by five hundred Bi&s;hops in a general Council. This, you &s;ee, is a method of &s;etting a&s;ide their authority, as effectual as any that has ever been attempted, by any heretic that ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>You &s;ay the Bi&s;hops were vi&s;ibly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; I believe they were; this again is an objection which Luther might equally have urged again&s;t the Coun|cil of Trent, the Iconocla&s;ts again&s;t the &s;econd of Nice, and Arius again&s;t the fir&s;t, &amp;c. The Bi|&s;hops are jealous of the rights of religion; are ever watchful over the &s;acred depo&s;itum committed to their care, and as they are commanded to deliver it to after generations, without &s;pot or blemi&s;h, as they had received it from their fathers, they &s;tart at the lea&s;t innovation. Should they afterwards proceed to cen&s;ure, they mu&s;t be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the im|pre&s;&s;ions of truth again&s;t error and novelty. But they con&s;ulted no one in London? Really, Sir, this is not quite the truth. But I &s;uppo&s;e you mean
<PB N="26" REF="38">
that they con&s;ulted none of the Committee, or of their friends. Indeed I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity they had to con&s;ult any one on this &s;ide of the que&s;tion. They had already received all the information they had any right to expect from that quarter. They had a book in folio to in&s;truct them, and a po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance that not one tittle of the oath would be &s;uffered to be altered; as if the &s;ame mea&s;ures were again to &s;uc|ceed, as had been practi&s;ed with regard to the pro|te&s;tation. The Bi&s;hops, however, by this time, found they had been drawn into a &s;nare, and there|fore were re&s;olved that their &s;ignature of the prote&s;t &s;hould be no hindrance to the &s;entence they deter|mined to pa&s;s upon the oath. They had previou&s;ly had the opinions of &s;ome of the be&s;t Divines of their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, and moreover took the advice of tho&s;e, even in London, whom they thought they could tru&s;t, and then proceeded to condemn, not, as you &s;ay, the Bill, the Prote&s;tation, and the Oath; but the oath only; and &s;ome re&s;tric|tive cau&s;es of the bill, by which we were placed in a wor&s;e condition, than before, and to which, they thought, we ought not to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e therefore appearing clear, they had every degree of information nece&s;&s;ary; and there|fore their deci&s;ion was regular and legal. Our &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t follow of cour&s;e, unle&s;s this &s;entence is rever&s;ed, by a higher court, which, I fancy, you will never &s;olicit, and &s;hould you, it would not be granted. I &s;hall now proceed to examine the right of interference in the Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="39">
I own I am perfectly a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;uch a plea &s;hould ever be made. I once more return to my retortion. This plea would equally &s;erve to &s;upport every error that ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>The author and promoter of every here&s;y might &s;ay, and has always &s;aid, that the interference of Bi&s;hops is illegal, that they mean not to infringe on the rights of religion, that they &s;upport no doctrines contrary to faith, &amp;c. Let the oath of &s;upremacy it&s;elf be propo&s;ed as a te&s;t of Civil allegiance, why could not this be equally taken, on the &s;ame grounds? At all events, that oath might go down, by means of an explication. We need only be told that the Committee have con&s;ulted per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rate abilities, who have long been exerci&s;ed in con&s;ti|tutional di&s;qui&s;itions, from whom the people of England receive their notions, both of names and things; that the&s;e great men do not under&s;tand the oath of &s;upremacy, as &s;ubver&s;ive of the Pope's juri&s;|diction, in as much as it is purely &s;piritual; but only &s;o far as it is coercive, and to be enforced, by means of a temporal nature: if then is added, that go|vernment and the public are tho&s;e who are to be &s;atisfied, that they in&s;i&s;t on this oath, and will accept of no other, then, I &s;ay, we have &s;ummed up the be&s;t rea&s;ons for the pre&s;ent oath; and which are equally &s;trong in favour of that of &s;upremacy, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>May not government require, as a te&s;t of our Civil allegiance, that we renounce tran&s;ub&s;tanti|ation, or any other article of our creed? You
<PB N="28" REF="40">
might equally &s;wallow that, and pretend that you only reject it &s;o far, as it is inimical to Civil govern|ment, viz. none at all; to what ab&s;urdities would the&s;e principles lead us? A te&s;t of civil allegiance! why then are religious topics introduced? A mere te&s;t of allegiance has nothing to do with religion. We are ready to &s;wear allegiance to his Maje&s;ty, in as full and ample a manner, as any government in the world has a right to exact it, from a &s;ubject of any denomination. But we mu&s;t renounce certain opinions inimical to civil government? or they cannot tru&s;t, even to our oaths? What ab&s;urdity! If they will not believe our actions, they would not believe, though even one was to ri&s;e from the dead, to a&s;&s;ure them of our &s;idelity. If they &s;uppo&s;e that no oaths can bind us; how can this one? If we can get di&s;pen&s;ations for oaths, or evade their force, by mental re&s;trictions; why have we not done &s;o with tho&s;e oaths, which have all along been exacted by government? Why have we, for two hundred years, &s;uffered di&s;abilities, &s;ines, impri&s;onment, and death it&s;elf; when a di&s;pen&s;ation, or mental re&s;tric|tion would have &s;et us on a level with our fellow &s;ubjects? or were tho&s;e our real principles, could we not equally follow them, in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion? we certainly &s;hould follow them, and take the oath without further examination, and then get over it, either by a mental re&s;triction or di&s;pen&s;ation. But after all we are ready to &s;atisfy them, and renounce tho&s;e principles, which are any ways repugnant to the duties of civil and &s;ocial life. Yet we are told
<PB N="29" REF="41">
that this is to be done, in terms pre&s;cribed, by men in power, and that they mu&s;t be &s;atisfied. An oath is therefore framed for the purpo&s;e, which equally rejects truth with &s;al&s;ehood, &s;ound doctrines with error.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir, this is too much. Were that the ca&s;e, I &s;hould not attempt to defend it. The oath of &s;upremacy, and others you have hinted at, cannot be taken by a Catholic, as they reject the principles of our faith. But the pre&s;ent oath is a mere te&s;t of civil allegiance, and no ways affects the rights of religion. Although <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this oath has been before government and the nation for above a year, yet no one has ever been able to point out a &s;ingle deviation from the rules of faith or morality."</Q> It is therefore only a te&s;t of civil allegiance, and the Bi&s;hops had no right to interfere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, a bare a&s;&s;ertion is no proof. However, you mu&s;t grant that if this oath does contain any thing contrary to &s;ound doctrine, then it cannot be taken: therefore the que&s;tion finally re&s;ts on the intrin&s;ic merits of the oath: the oath then mu&s;t be examined; by whom? once more I a&s;&s;ert, it belongs to the Bi&s;hops to examine, whether an oath con|tains any thing contrary to religion: they have done this, and condemned it. Shall we adhere to our Pa&s;tors, or to the Committee? The Bi&s;hops &s;ay, children take not that oath; it contains a poi&s;on, which will contaminate your &s;ouls. The Committee &s;ays, Gentlemen, do not mind your Bi&s;hops, the oath is only a te&s;t of allegiance. Their
<PB N="30" REF="42">
proof of this is, the C&mdash; the M&mdash; &amp;c. un|der&s;tand it only in that &s;en&s;e. Is this the way that Chri&s;tians u&s;ed formerly to rea&s;on on the tenets of their religion? Did they go to the Emperors or their mini&s;ters, to be informed what was &s;ound doctrine, and what was not?</P>
<P>But no one has ever been able to point out wherein it deviates from faith or morality? Indeed, Sir, &s;everal propo&s;itions have been pointed out, which, without doubt, expre&s;s doctrines contrary to the principles of our religion, either directly, or by ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary inference, the only an&s;wer that has ever been given is, in effect, that the oath does not mean what it &s;ays. But, if you plea&s;e, we will now examine the oath it&s;elf: for after all your preliminaries and a&s;&s;ertions, your cau&s;e mu&s;t be decided by the intrin&s;ic merits of the oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own that the que&s;tion mu&s;t be &s;inally deter|mined, by the oath it&s;elf. I have heard &s;ome diffi|culties, but none of any con&s;equence. They were all grounded either in an apprehen&s;ion of being trappaned into error; or too &s;trong an adhe&s;ion to &s;chola&s;tic nicety. However I am willing to di&s;cu&s;s the oath it&s;elf: and wi&s;h you to &s;tate your difficul|ties again&s;t it, from beginning to end; that we may leave nothing unexamined which can be objected again&s;t it.</P>

<P>I &s;hall then begin with the clau&s;e, in the oath, by which we &s;wear to maintain, &s;upport and defend the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line exclu|&s;ively. What right has any government on earth to
<PB N="31" REF="43">
exact &s;uch a clau&s;e in an oath of allegiance? &s;o compleatly foreign to the purpo&s;e of &s;uch an oath? I could write a treati&s;e again&s;t it; but &s;hall only remark for the pre&s;ent, that, if government required it, we might as well &s;wear to maintain, &s;upport and defend all the penal laws, which &s;tand in our &s;tatute books, to the &s;candal of an enlightened age, and the di&s;grace of a nation, which boa&s;ts of its freedom. In this &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;hould the nation at large, with its King at their head, be reconciled to the Catholic Church, by virtue of this curious oath, I am bound to fight, till death, again&s;t the King and the nation, becau&s;e they have jointly come over to my religion! Nay even, though on one in the nation, &s;hould turn to the Catholic religion; &s;hould the decendants of Sophia, Duche&s;s of Hanover, at any future period, forfeit their right to the crown, and another family be placed on the throne, I &s;hould equally be bound, by this oath, to enli&s;t under the banners of Don Quixote, and encounter every windmill or &s;lock of &s;heep, which &s;hould declare in favour of the new King, again&s;t the family of Brun&s;wick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions are too lu|dicrous to de&s;erve a &s;erious an&s;wer. However, &s;up|po&s;e the ca&s;es propo&s;ed, this law would be rever&s;ed by the nation, and therefore this oath would no longer be binding. But, Sir, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this is the oath of abjuration taken by all the King's &s;ubjects, and which for the &s;ake of unformity, the pre&s;ent government in&s;i&s;ts on being tendered equally to

Catholics, as to every other de&s;cription of men. The Catholics have in fact already taken it; and the Crown lawyers have determined that the oath of 1778 involves every con&s;equence of the common oath of allegiance and abjuration. Whoever op|po&s;es the act of &s;ettlement incurs a premunire, if in di&s;cour&s;e; high trea&s;on, if in writing or action. By recognizing his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, to be lawful kings of this realm, their title to the throne is equally recognized; and that title is grounded &s;olely on the act of &s;ettlement."</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are knock down arguments, with a wit|ne&s;s. It is high trea&s;on to oppo&s;e the act of &s;ettle|ment; therefore I am obliged in con&s;cience to &s;wear to maintain, &s;upport and defend it: I have &s;worn to &s;upport the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his Maje&s;ty's family; therefore I have &s;worn to oppo&s;e any of his Maje|&s;ty's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hould they come over to my faith: I have &s;worn to depo&s;e even his Maje&s;ty now on the throne, &s;hould he become a Catholic! This is a depo&s;ing power, which I &s;wear to &s;upport and de|fend; and this power is to be exerci&s;ed, for no other rea&s;on, than a con&s;cientious practice of that religion, which I believe to be the only true one: in one part I &s;wear again&s;t the depo&s;ing power, here I &s;wear to maintain, &s;upport and defend it. But, the Crown lawyers have defined and decided the que|&s;tion; &s;o I am bound, by oath, to every con&s;equence, which their learned heads can draw from an oath, by wre&s;ting it, from its plain and obvious &s;en&s;e! I &s;hall endeavour to prove, that this oath de&s;troys the
<PB N="33" REF="45">
boa&s;ted <HI>omnipotence</HI> of Parliament: this is a con&s;e|quence which the Crown Lawyers probably have not attended to, but to which I equally &s;wear as to the other. For, Sir, by virtue of this oath, the reigning family is as firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne, as if it were appointed, by God him&s;elf, or had an hereditary right altogether indefea&s;ible: and there|fore the Parliament, even with the con&s;ent of the nation at large, can never alter the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, in any given ca&s;e what&s;oever? You &s;ay indeed, in the ca&s;es referred to before, that this law would be rever&s;ed. But, Sir, the per&s;on who &s;hould propo&s;e the repeal of the act of &s;ettlement would be perjured, he who &s;econds it would be perjured, eve|ry man in the nation that a&s;&s;ents to it would equally be perjured; and even every one who does not u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to prevent the repeal would incur the guilt of perjury. I may then truly &s;ay, that this act can never be repealed, while this oath &s;tands; as it cannot be repealed without &s;tigmatizing a whole nation with the guilt of perjury. I think this oath is a flat contradiction to the very funda|mental principles of our happy con&s;titution: Let the act of &s;ettlement remain till Parliament and the nation think proper to repeal it, but let no man be bound to &s;wear to maintain, &s;upport and defend it to the utmo&s;t of his power; for this is evidently o|verturning the con&s;titution, as &s;ettled, by that very act.</P>
<P>I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that the omnipotence of Parliament has its bounds: there is another court,
<PB N="34" REF="46">
before which the members of the Briti&s;h &s;enate mu&s;t one day appear; they will then know whether they had a right to deprive a man of his Crown, his e&s;tate or his life on account of his religion. Till then I &s;hall neither oppo&s;e nor write again&s;t the act of &s;ettlement; but I can not, in honour and con|&s;cience, as an Engli&s;hman, who admires the con&s;ti|tution of his country, I can not &s;wear to maintain, &s;upport and defend it, to the utmo&s;t of my power: for at &s;ome future period, the wi&s;dom of the nation may think proper to alter it; it may, for any thing we know, be nece&s;&s;ary to alter it, and this can never be effected, while this oath &s;tands. I hope, Sir, you will not &s;ay that Parliament can di&s;pen&s;e with the obligation of this oath. Will you plea&s;e to drop this &s;ubject, as it is of too delicate a nature to be treated with freedom.</P>

<P>With all my heart. What then is the next clau&s;e you object to? I hope you are not &s;o nar|row-minded as to cavil at the word <HI>heretical.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No Catholic he&s;itates, to call the depo&s;ing and king-killing doctrines antichri&s;tian, contrary to the word of God and the tradition of the fathers: ma|terially heretical in one part, and both materially and formally heretical in the other. Be&s;ides this is the oath of the kingdom, and if Catholics wi&s;h to &s;hare in the privileges of citizens, they mu&s;t bind them&s;elves by the &s;ame ties, with their fellow &s;ubjects."</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I do make &s;o very &s;erious an ob|jection again&s;t that word, that, although every other
<PB N="35" REF="47">
difficulty &s;hould be removed, I would not take the oath. For that doctrine, however fal&s;e, erroneous or whatever el&s;e it be called, is not heretical. He|re&s;y has always been defined an error in articles of faith; you know well, that nothing can be an ar|ticle of faith, unle&s;s 1, it be a revealed doctrine, and 2, unle&s;s it be propo&s;ed, by the Church, to be believed as &s;uch. I hope you will not pretend that the oppo&s;ite doctrine to the depo&s;ing tenet is pro|po&s;ed by the Church, to be believed as revealed. Then the contrary doctrine is not heretical.</P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervation of material here&s;y is not ju&s;t. For what is only materially heretical, is not properly heretical in the plain and obvious &s;en&s;e of the word, to which we &s;wear. Hence, &s;wearing that you be|lieve that doctrine to be heretical, is perjury, unle&s;s you re&s;train the term from its plain and obvious meaning, to an improper &s;en&s;e: and this is a mental re&s;triction, contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the oath, which the illiterate multitude do not under&s;tand, and which tho&s;e, who framed, or tho&s;e, who tender the oath, have never thought of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, although it is not &s;trictly heretical in a Catholic &s;en&s;e, it is heretical, as Prote&s;tants un|der&s;tand it; and this is quite &s;ufficient for me to &s;wear it; as I mu&s;t take the oath, in that &s;en&s;e, in which it is propo&s;ed. Now, Sir, that doctrine is heretical, in their &s;en&s;e of the term, which is con|trary to the word of God: I hope, you will allow this doctrine to be contrary to the word of God: it is then heretical.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="48">
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, I might equally &s;wear that the contrary doctrine is an article of faith. What! becau&s;e Prote&s;tants have given a wrong ex|plication of the term, I may &s;wear to it, without explication or qualification? Indeed, Sir, if Prote|&s;tants ever are informed of the&s;e principles, I fear they will think that you make very light of oaths. You will, however, plea&s;e to remember the argu|ment of John Almond, <HI>alias</HI> Lathome, urged a|gain&s;t Dr. King Bi&s;hop of London, recorded in the Memoirs of Mi&s;&s;ionary Prie&s;ts, by which he &s;ilen|ced the Bi&s;hop, and proved, beyond a reply, that the depo&s;ing doctrine is not heretical, even in the prote&s;tant &s;en&s;e of the word: his argument was this: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No po&s;ition, <HI>on your grounds,</HI> can be heretical, un|le&s;s it be <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> cen&s;ured for heretical, by the word of God, or the contradictory <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> con|tained in the word of God; but this po&s;ition (the depo&s;ing doctrine) is not <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> cen&s;ured for heretical, by the word of God; nor is the con|tradictory <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> contained in the word of God: <HI>ergo</HI> it is not heretical."</Q> This was his argument, it is now mine. Should you a&s;k, with the Bi&s;hop, <HI>you would have it cen&s;ured in expre&s;s words?</HI> I an|&s;wer, with the martyr, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are bound to bring a cen&s;ure in expre&s;s words; which becau&s;e I &s;ee you can not, an&s;wer this con&s;equence; this po&s;i|tion is not &s;et down at all in the bible: <HI>ergo</HI> it can not be cen&s;ured, by the bible."</Q> The only an&s;wer the Bi&s;hop made was, <HI>that Almond was a proud ar|rogant Jack.</HI> This, Sir, you mu&s;t know is an unan|&s;werable

argument, in prote&s;tant principles; which cannot admit of an article of faith, without expre&s;s warrant from &s;cripture. In a word, the depo&s;ing doctrine is not properly heretical, either in the Ca|tholic or the Prote&s;tant acceptation of the term: therefore this oath can not lawfully be taken, either by Catholics or Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>To what you add, that this is the oath of the kingdom, &amp;c. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that the &s;ame political motives would equally prove the lawfulne&s;s of the oath of &s;upremacy, or any other, which di&s;grace our &s;tatute books, to the eternal &s;hame of an enlightened age.</P>

<P>I do not &s;ee any &s;en&s;e in this logical acutene&s;s; too clo&s;e an adhe&s;ion to &s;chola&s;tic accuracy, is very ill timed: we may &s;ometimes over-&s;hoot the mark, by too great nicety: I think it is a pity that &s;uch cavils &s;hould hinder our emancipation from the pre&s;|&s;ure of the penal laws. Suppo&s;e the word heretical were not exactly accurate, as it is only in&s;erted for a &s;trong mark of aver&s;ion to &s;uch doctrines, I do not &s;ee why we may not be authori&s;ed to admit of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, this doctrine will not do, when we &s;wear to the plain and ordinary &s;en&s;e of the words. I &s;uppo&s;e you remember, that the ta&s;k of qualifying bad doctrines, by proper epithets, is per|haps one of the harde&s;t, in dogmatical theology. There are doctrines, which, though not heretical, are neverthele&s;s, <HI>nearly heretical, &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y;</HI> others, though not &s;chi&s;matical, are <HI>leading to</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="50">
<HI>&s;chi&s;m;</HI> others again <HI>erroneous, &s;u&s;picious, &s;canda|lous, ra&s;h, offen&s;ive of pious ears,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. It is, I &s;ay, a very difficult matter to fix the preci&s;e quali|fication to every propo&s;ition: but where the qualifi|cation is evidently wrong, which is really the ca&s;e, in our pre&s;ent debate, no Catholic can, in con&s;ci|ence, &s;ub&s;cribe to it; for that defect fal&s;ifies the whole propo&s;ition. For although it be true, that the depo&s;ing doctrine is <HI>fal&s;e, erroneous, &s;editious,</HI> and perhaps <HI>impious,</HI> in as much as it is a violation of our duty to Kings, commanded, by the fourth precept of the law, yet it is mo&s;t certainly not here|tical. As for the word damnable, I do not &s;ee what preci&s;e &s;en&s;e it bears, and therefore would have it expunged as u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h my ob&s;ervations on this head, with a remark on the ungenerous treatment we are forced to &s;ubmit to, from our prote&s;tant brethren, in this particular.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is a known fact, that the Popes have never yet attempted to dethrone Princes, who were born and bred up Prote&s;tants, but &s;uch only as were Catho|lics, and excommunicated for their crimes, real or &s;uppo&s;ed, or inva&s;ion of the rights of the Church: It is al&s;o a notorious lamentable fact, that mo&s;t of the principal reformers preached and practi&s;ed, when in their power, the depo&s;ing doctrine of Catholic prin|ces, whenever they oppo&s;ed the preaching of the word of God, as they termed it. The expul&s;ion of the Queen of Scots, by her rebellious &s;ubjects, and the &s;ub&s;equent murder of that independent &s;overeign
<PB N="39" REF="51">
Prince&s;s, by Queen Elizabeth, are an indelible di&s;|grace to Great Britain. However, we are &s;till to be abu&s;ed and reviled, for teaching the king-killing doctrine, which we have ever abhorred, and the depo&s;ing doctrine, which never was a principle of our religion, and which we are all ready to abjure, in any terms, which do not imply a fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to reflect, Sir, that this very act, by which Catholics are permitted to enjoy &s;ome few only of the inalienable rights of man, enforces this very doctrine of depo&s;ing kings, by declaring a Ca|tholic to be deprived of the right to the crown. Prote&s;tants, who have preached and practi&s;ed the&s;e doctrines, are willing to grant a legal exerci&s;e of our religion, which they are a&s;hamed to refu&s;e, yet &s;till confined under &s;uch legal re&s;trictions, as are never el&s;ewhere e&s;tabli&s;hed; and all this on condition that we &s;hall be compelled to abjure and renounce as <HI>heretical</HI> a doctrine, which was the univer&s;al doc|trine of the fir&s;t reformers, without which the refor|mation had never been propagated, and which is &s;upported and confirmed, by this very act! Sure, Sir, this is an indignity to which I hope you will not &s;ubmit. It is mo&s;t certainly a di&s;grace to Prote&s;tants, to propo&s;e it. If you plea&s;e, we will pa&s;s to the next clau&s;e in the oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed. I &s;uppo&s;e it is that about the Pope's authority. But Catholics are not called upon to explain, how far the authority of the Pope really extends. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They are only required to &s;ay that it does not affect the con&s;titution, nor the <HI>legal</HI> e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
<PB N="40" REF="52">
of the Church, nor the rights of the &s;ubject; all temporal concerns undoubtedly; and when by a negative oath Catholics have di&s;claim|ed any temporal interference, they are left at full liberty to believe and practi&s;e whatever their con|&s;ciences may tell them to be conformable to the revelation of Chri&s;t, or the decrees of the Church."</Q> I hope you do not allow of any power or right in the Pope to interfere in temporals.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I am as willing as your&s;elf to ab|jure the Pope's right of interference in concerns of a temporal nature; but the oath, as it &s;tands, either directly, or by ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences, ab|jures al&s;o his &s;piritual juri&s;diction, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to which it has always been believed to extend. I will point out the particular difficulty, in this paragraph, and then we will examine it calmly and candidly.</P>
<P>I abjure, with you, all right of interference which can directly or indirectly affect the independence, &s;overeignty or con&s;titution of this kingdom, or with the civil government thereof; or with the tempo|ral rights, or civil liberty or property of the &s;ubject. But as to the <HI>laws</HI> of the nation, the <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical government,</HI> as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> of the &s;ubjects of the&s;e realms, I think no Catholic can &s;wear away the right of the Pope's interference, without abjuring the Catholic doctrine of his prima|cy. Now, Sir, if you plea&s;e we will di&s;cu&s;s the&s;e articles &s;eparately, for the &s;ake of per&s;picuity.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, as to the laws: I was once of opinion that this might be admitted, if the &s;trict definition
<PB N="41" REF="53">
of law were attended to: becau&s;e a nece&s;&s;ary con|dition of a law is that it &s;hall be ju&s;t and lawful, I thought that the &s;anguinary penal laws, as al&s;o eve|ry other &s;tatute, in this kingdom, if repugnant to the laws of God or the Church, would not be com|prehended under that name. And, as I do not allow any right of interference with the ju&s;t laws of any nation, it appeared that the laws in England could not be &s;ubjected to any &s;ort of controul of the Pope. But the nation at large would certainly under&s;tand every act of parliament as comprehended under the name of law; and therefore to abjure the right of interference, in the Pope, in this unlimited man|ner, would be abjuring his &s;piritual &s;upremacy and juri&s;diction, which he holds from God alone. For, in virtue of his primacy, he is bound to watch over the laws of God and the Church, and to enforce the ob&s;ervance of both, by commands, cen&s;ures and other &s;piritual means: and of cour&s;e, to command the non-ob&s;ervance of the laws of any kingdom, when &s;uch laws are contrary to tho&s;e of God and the Church. In England, not to mention other matters, &s;everal impediments of matrimony are done away, by the laws of the realm. Should then Ca|tholics marry, under any of the&s;e di&s;abilities, which have not the &s;ame effect, by the laws of the land; the Pope, in virtue of his primacy, has an undoubt|ed right to command a &s;eparation, to enforce his commands, by eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I apprehend this is to interfere in the laws of the land, at lea&s;t in an indirect manner. To
<PB N="42" REF="54">
recall or abrogate the laws, would be a direct inter|ference; to command, or bind the con&s;cience to the non-ob&s;ervance of the laws, would be interfering indirectly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree to your divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject. Now to what you have advanced on the right of inter|ference in the laws of the land, I have only to remark, that the difficulty evidently originates in mi&s;conception. The legal meaning and force of the terms are chiefly to be con&s;idered. Words, in every language, may alter their prior &s;ignification, and carry a different import. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The lawyers and tho&s;e who&s;e lives are &s;pent in attending to great legi&s;lative que&s;tions . . . from whom the people of England are in the habit of deriving their notions both of words and things."</Q> Such men, I &s;ay, are the be&s;t qualified to a&s;certain the preci&s;e meaning and import of the oath. Now our Committee a&s;&s;ures us that they have not met a &s;ingle per&s;on of this de|&s;cription, who does not under&s;tand and rea&s;on on the expre&s;&s;ion, in que&s;tion, in the &s;ame manner as they do: that is, that the oath only abjures an interference of a coercive nature: they &s;ay, that they only intend to deny the right <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to legi&s;late in tem|poral concerns; or to enforce his (the Pope's) &s;piritual legi&s;lation, by a coercion of a temporal nature."</Q> Surely you will not allow any &s;uch power in the Pope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow of no temporal power in the primacy; whatever territorial juri&s;diction he may have, from grants of &s;overeign Princes, or otherwi&s;e, in as much
<PB N="43" REF="55">
as &s;uch authority is given, by men as to a Prince, not, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t as to a Bi&s;hop and Primate of the Church, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be confined to his own dominions; out of which he has no tem|poral authority what&s;oever. But, Sir, in virtue of his &s;piritual authority, he is bound to watch over the laws of God and the Church, and to enforce the ob&s;ervance of them, any temporal laws or con|&s;titutions to the contrary notwith&s;tanding. When|ever then the laws of a kingdom, are contrary to the laws of God or the Church, as was always and &s;till is the ca&s;e, where the Catholic is not the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion, the Pope, by virtue of his &s;piritual authority, is bound to exert the power of the Keys committed to him, by commanding the non-ob&s;er|vance of &s;uch temporal laws: and &s;hould the Pa&s;tors be remi&s;s in watching over the execution of &s;uch his commands, he has an undoubted right to compell them to obedience, by cen&s;ures of excommuni|cation, &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or interdict as he judges nece&s;|&s;ary. It were tri&s;ling with the plain and ordinary &s;en&s;e of words to &s;ay, that this is not the inter|ference meant, by the oath. This oath expre&s;sly abjures every right of interference, direct or indirect in the laws of the land: I cannot conceive how a command to violate the laws, or cen&s;ure again&s;t any one for not violating them, can be &s;aid not to interfere, at lea&s;t indirectly. There is not a dictionary extant that will authori&s;e the &s;uppo&s;ition. The Committee's appeal to the lawyers, &amp;c. is foreign to the purpo&s;e; it is not to any new expo&s;i|tion
<PB N="44" REF="56">
or import of the words, nor to any learned interpretation of them, that we are called to &s;wear, but to the plain obvious and <HI>ordinary</HI> &s;en&s;e; which of cour&s;e, ought to be as well under&s;tood, by every man of &s;ound judgment in the nation, as by the Lord Chancellor him&s;elf. I beg leave, Sir, to a&s;&s;ert, from the Committee's Letter to the Bi&s;hops, that a <HI>com|mand</HI> or cen&s;ure is an <HI>interference. My Lords,</HI> they &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to this imprudent <HI>interference</HI> of Paul the Vth, Engli&s;h Catholics may a&s;cribe, in a great mea|&s;ure, all the odium, and all the oppre&s;&s;ion under which they have &s;ince groaned."</Q> Paul the Vth, then really did interfere; the Committee ibid. will tell you how; <HI>he &s;ulminated a condemnation of this political oath:</HI> meaning the oath of James I. <HI>he declared it incon&s;i&s;tent with faith, and ho&s;tile to &s;alvation,</HI> and enjoined the Engli&s;h Catholics not to take it, as they &s;ay in their <HI>appeal from the cen&s;ure of the Bi&s;hops to the Catholics of England.</HI> A com|mand, a prohibition, a cen&s;ure are therefore an interference, even as the Committee under&s;tand the term: but they allow a right of commanding, &amp;c. in the la&s;t mentioned letter,: page 6. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If one province of a kingdom, were, without ju&s;tice or rea&s;on to rebel again&s;t the &s;tate . . . . if one &s;tate were to exerci&s;e undue &s;overeignty over another&mdash;if the con&s;titution of a &s;tate were e&s;&s;entially wicked&mdash;if the government of a &s;tate were to be tyranical and unju&s;t, &amp;c. are not the&s;e as much &s;ins in the eye of God, as they are crimes in the eye of man? As &s;uch, are they not &s;ubject to the
<PB N="45" REF="57">
&s;piritual power of the Church, to her teaching, preaching, and cen&s;uring."</Q> In this pa&s;&s;age they only mention the Church, but from their manner of rea&s;oning, in the fifth page, they evidently &s;up|po&s;e this &s;ame right in the Pope: he then has a right to i&s;&s;ue his commands, prohibitions and cen|&s;ures; but, as you have &s;een, from the letter to the Bi&s;hops, commands, or prohibitions and <HI>a fortiori</HI> cen&s;ures are a real interference. He has then an undoubted right to interfere in the laws, when they are contrary to the laws of God or the Church.</P>
<P>I own I was rather &s;urpri&s;ed at reading the la&s;t quoted pa&s;&s;age; it gives a power to the Church, or the Pope, which &s;uppo&s;es a right of in&s;pection over the politi|cal con&s;titution, the right of &s;overeignty, or re&s;i|&s;tance; for without &s;uch a right, how can he pronounce, in any of the ca&s;es above mentioned. I rather think this was an unguarded conce&s;&s;ion, as a few lines below we find the following words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Church has no juri&s;diction or authority, that can directly or indirectly, affect or interfere with the civil independence, &s;overeignty, con|&s;titution or government of a &s;overeign &s;tate is acknowledged, by our be&s;t writers."</Q> He has no right to interfere in the Civil independence, or &s;overeignty of a &s;tate; yet he may pronounce again&s;t the independence of any part of an empire, &s;hould it unju&s;tly rebel. He has no right to interfere in the con&s;titution, but he may pronounce it e&s;&s;entially wicked: he has no right to interfere in the govern|ment of a &s;tate, but he may declare it tyranical
<PB N="46" REF="58">
and unju&s;t. What can all this mean? I fear we mu&s;t go to the C&mdash; to under&s;tand it. The Committee here grants a power to the Pope, which very few Pontiffs have ever a&s;&s;umed. The Pope did not attempt to decide whether Great Britain was tyranical, or America unju&s;t in rebel|ling. The pre&s;ent Pope indeed has written to the Bi&s;hops in the Netherlands, to exhort them to u&s;e their influence in re-e&s;tabli&s;hing order, and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to their new Prince; but the Bi&s;hops thought proper to judge for them&s;elves, and an&s;wered his Holine&s;s accordingly, though with due re&s;pect: we have not heard of his <HI>interfering</HI> any further.</P>
<P>As for the word <HI>Coercion,</HI> it is perhaps equally ambiguous, as the term interference.</P>
<P>Should a man be forced by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or excommunication to re&s;tore the Church's patri|mony unju&s;tly &s;eized, or &s;hould a kingdom be laid under an interdict to enforce a compliance with the laws of God or the Church, would not the&s;e means be called coercive? It were folly to &s;wear that the Pope has no right to &s;end an army to enforce &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his mandates.</P>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, this too clo&s;e adhe&s;ion to nicety will do us no good. We have a fair and candid expo&s;ition of the oath, given by the Committee; they declare po&s;itively that this expo&s;ition is the real &s;en&s;e of it, and that it is under&s;tood in that &s;en&s;e, by all the great men in the nation: you know it is a maxim in law, that you mu&s;t take an oath in the &s;en&s;e of the framer and propo&s;er of it; why therefore &s;hould we refu&s;e this oath, on account of
<PB N="47" REF="59">
this clau&s;e, which confe&s;&s;edly only abjures <HI>coercive interference;</HI> which even your&s;elf do not allow of? The explication of the Committee is orthodox, and moreover gives the true &s;en&s;e of the oath.</P>

<P>I am very willing to &s;ubmit to the judgment of a man, in his own art, of which I am ignorant. Granting then every degree of competency, to the deci&s;ions of tho&s;e great men, you allude to, in legal and con&s;titutional di&s;qui&s;itions, am I al&s;o to allow them to be competent judges, in religious que&s;tions? Mu&s;t I give them an infallibility, in this <HI>dogmatical fact,</HI> which they require of me to refu&s;e to the Pope, even <HI>in doctrines?</HI> Mu&s;t I appeal to the adver&s;aries of my faith, to know how far their tenets injure my Creed?

Would you, Sir, take the oath of &s;upremacy, were the Chancellor to tell you, that no &s;piritual juri&s;diction is meant to be abjured thereby, except &s;uch as is enforced, by coercive mea&s;ures, of a temporal nature? I mu&s;t then &s;ay, I cannot admit of their expo&s;ition; which, if it be the right one, they can have no rational objection to alter; that the terms expre&s;&s;ing their meaning, &s;hall otherwi&s;e be &s;o couched, as to calm the fears of Catholics.</P>
<P>The explication of the Committee is not ortho|dox, in the article of di&s;pen&s;ing with the obligation of oaths; nor in the abjuration of the Pope's infal|libility, as a <HI>pernicious doctrine.</HI> It is captious and en&s;naring, in the abjuration of the &s;piritual power of the Pope, and the title of Prote&s;ting Catholic Diffenter. It does not touch upon &s;everal real
<PB N="48" REF="60">
difficulties; it is not then admi&s;&s;ible. The true, plain, obvious and ordinary &s;en&s;e of an oath appears naturally on the fir&s;t reading of it, not from learned expo&s;itions. What was the &s;en&s;e of the oath, in the opinion of almo&s;t all Catholics, previous to the explication? What is &s;till the opinion of our Di|vines abroad? Even the explication it&s;elf has not convinced one half of the nation. It remains then not plainly and obviou&s;ly orthodox, but at be&s;t ob&s;cure and equivocal: it &s;hould not then be ad|mitted.</P>
<P>What you &s;ay, of the maxim of Canon Law, is very ju&s;t, in this &s;en&s;e, that you are not to wre&s;t an oath, from the &s;en&s;e of the propo&s;ers, by private interpretation, mental re&s;triction, &amp;c. But this will not authori&s;e you to &s;wear to an error, in the plain and ordinary &s;en&s;e of the words; although perhaps the error would be removed, by a private interpretation of the framers of it.</P>
<P>Remember, Sir, the private intrepretation given, by Ur&s;arius and Valens, in the Council of Ariminum; and of the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, when they granted the &s;upremacy to King Henry the VIIIth. Re|member al&s;o, the fatal con&s;equences of acceding to mea&s;ures, which were not lawful, without the&s;e private interpretations. You know well, that the Bi&s;hops &s;hamefully prevaricated, in both ca&s;es. In the former, they &s;acrificed the word con&s;ub&s;tantial, con&s;ecrated by the Council of Nice. In the latter, they gave up an article of faith. Have we not every rea&s;on to fear the &s;ame dire effects in our
<PB N="49" REF="61">
times? Suppo&s;e we take the oath, in the explained &s;en&s;e; put the following ca&s;e, &s;hould any Catholic take advantage of the laws of the land, having divorced his wife for <HI>Crim. Con.</HI> marry again, dur|ing her life time; in this ca&s;e I &s;ay, &s;hould the Pope interfere, by commands or cen&s;ures, would not every per&s;on, who accedes to, or &s;ubmits to this interference, be con&s;idered as a prevaricator, again&s;t his oath? The&s;e rea&s;ons, you &s;ee, equally prove the other two exceptions, of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical go|vernment, and the per&s;ons of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, to be inadmi&s;&s;ible. For if he has a right to com|mand, and if commanding is a real interference, then this oath cannot be reconciled with the rights of his primacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not &s;ee what the Pope has to do with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government of the nation, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; for as &s;uch, it is a civil and temporal concern, in which you do not allow of any inter|ference. As to the per&s;ons of Engli&s;hmen, he has no further to do with them, than to teach them their duty as their Primate, when it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary, to exert his authority &s;o far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I &s;uppo&s;e, were this oath taken, and the act pa&s;t, that you would deny the Pope every right of juri&s;diction over the Catholic religion, as, in that ca&s;e, it would al&s;o be e&s;tabli&s;hed, by law, and of cour&s;e a temporal concern, as you are plea&s;ed to term it. But, Sir, whether the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed, by law, be Catholic or Prote&s;tant, we Catholics cannot deny, but that the &s;overeign Pontiff is the
<PB N="50" REF="62">
real Pa&s;tor of every one, who has entered the Church, by bapti&s;m: and that he is, by right of the primacy, the proper &s;uperior of every lawful eccle|&s;ia&s;tical government; and moreover that he is in|ve&s;ted with a right of controul over ever unlawful eccle&s;ia&s;tical government. You &s;ee, Sir, from the quo|tation above, that the Committee allows a right of in&s;pection even over the civil government, when it is e&s;&s;entially wicked or tyranical; Is not every un|lawful &s;piritual Government &s;uch? I mu&s;t indeed ob&s;erve, that, when an eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, whether e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, or not, has ca&s;t off the authority of the See of Rome, e&s;pecially when it has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for a long &s;eries of years, it would be idle and nugatory, in the &s;overeign Pontiff to i&s;&s;ue his commands or cen&s;ures, where, he mu&s;t know, they would be equally di&s;regarded. But the <HI>right</HI> of chief Pa&s;tor is one thing; the <HI>power</HI> of exerci&s;ing this right is another. It were folly to &s;wear again&s;t the power of executing his decrees; for plain fact declares that he has none; but we are called upon to &s;wear again&s;t the <HI>right,</HI> which, as Catholics, we cannot do: for, Sir, no violent divi&s;ion of unity, or &s;eparation from the communion of the Catholic Church, can ever deprive him of the right of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical controul, which he has received from God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;ay the &s;ame as to the per&s;ons; for, in quality of primate of the Church, all Catholics owe him eccle&s;ia&s;tical obedience: now his cen&s;ures or com|mands, although in matters purely &s;piritual, might have, at lea&s;t, an indirect interference, with the
<PB N="51" REF="63">
liberty and per&s;ons of Catholics. I fancy a &s;entence of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, depo&s;ition or excommunication ful|minated again&s;t any Clergyman on account of the oath, would &s;it very unea&s;ily on his &s;houlders, and would no doubt be con&s;idered as interfering, with his liberty and per&s;on too. Nay, I dare &s;ay, it would be called an interference, in temporals, by the abet|tors of the Committee, who are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that the oath is merely civil and political.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed, to the next clau&s;e in the oath; which I &s;hall only note, becau&s;e it is very ill worded, and might induce &s;ome ignorant per&s;on to think that we abjured the power of forgiving &s;in, by means of the &s;acrament of penance. This we cannot do, any more than Prote&s;tants can abjure the power of forgiving &s;ins, by means of bapti&s;m. It is indeed very true that no Prie&s;t or Prelate can forgive &s;ins at his will and plea&s;ure, without the previous and nece&s;&s;ary conditions of a &s;incere re|pentance: and although I believe that the Com|mittee under&s;tand it, in this &s;en&s;e, yet, as it &s;tands, worded, by our adver&s;aries, it is very &s;u&s;picious, and as &s;uch not admi&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no doubt, but that the Committee, and the framers of it, under&s;tand this clau&s;e, in the &s;en&s;e in which you have explained it; this &s;crupu|lous exactne&s;s, which you require throughout; as I have all along remarked, greatly injures our cau&s;e. Pray what is your next nicety?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the Prote&s;tation compells us to be cautious, in admitting any thing, which might, perhaps, be mi&s;con&s;trued, and wre&s;ted from
<PB N="52" REF="64">
our real meaning. My next difficulty is, that no breach of faith with any per&s;on can ever be ju&s;tified, under pretence that &s;uch per&s;on is an in&s;idel. I have no difficulty in the clau&s;e as far as it concerns here|tics; nor even as it touches in&s;idels, provided that the <HI>breach of faith</HI> be re&s;trained to common deal|ings, promi&s;es, or engagements between men. But, as you have ob&s;erved, I am become &s;o very nice, that I will not admit of any expre&s;&s;ion, which is not &s;trictly accurate; now, Sir, you will plea&s;e to recollect that a marriage with an in&s;idel, or one, who has not been baptized, is null and void, by the laws of the Church; would not a &s;eparation, from &s;uch per&s;on, after a marriage contracted, be deemed a breach of &s;aith, pledged in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and awful manner? It is however ju&s;tifiable, &s;hould that per&s;on refu&s;e to be bapti&s;ed, and re-married, barely becau&s;e that per&s;on is an in&s;idel.</P>
<P>I will pa&s;s, with your leave, from nicety, to a difficulty of a more &s;erious nature, contained, in the next clau&s;e, wherein, I am called upon to &s;wear, that <HI>no eccle&s;ia&s;tical power whatever can di&s;pen&s;e with the obligation of any oath what&s;oever.</HI> I have extracted thus much only, of this clau&s;e, becau&s;e, I allow of no power of di&s;pen&s;ing, in civil compacts or bargains, nor yet in oaths of allegiance. But this univer&s;al propo&s;ition, which denies the power of di&s;pen&s;ing in any oath whatever, is erroneous, and, not to &s;ay more of it, contrary to the univer&s;al practice of the Church.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean, I &s;uppo&s;e, promi&s;&s;ory oaths made to God. But, Sir, <HI>the bill does</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not refer to vows, or other &s;olemn promi&s;es made to God,"</Q> but only &s;uch as affect the rights of third per&s;ons. Now, Sir, in &s;uch promi&s;&s;ory oaths, between man and man, no prie&s;t or prelate can di&s;pen&s;e. An oath may be taken under &s;uch circum&s;tances as to be ab&s;olutely void; and then no di&s;pen&s;ation is nece&s;&s;ary: for example, in ca&s;e an <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"oath were extorted, by great per&s;onal violence, or threats of immediate death. In &s;uch ca&s;es, there may be a que&s;tion, whether the obligations exi&s;t: but if they do exi&s;t, no power can di&s;pen&s;e from them."</Q> This is the doc|trine of our Committee, page the 6th of their letter to the Catholics of England: and which they learned from &s;ome of the able&s;t divines of the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, this &s;trange explication does not amend the clau&s;e: but rather adds to its malignity. Although the Bill does not mention vows, yet it cer|tainly comprehends every oath, even tho&s;e made to God alone; and roundly a&s;&s;erts that no power can di&s;pen&s;e with the obligation of any &s;uch oath; this, I once more a&s;&s;ert, is erroneous. If you pretend, as &s;ome have done, that &s;uch oaths are to be con&s;i|dered as vows, I have only to an&s;wer, that your ex|plication is equally erroneous, with the a&s;&s;ertion: no orthodox Divine ever yet pretended to confound the nature of an oath, with that of a vow. They differ widly; as you will ea&s;ily di&s;cover, on the &s;lighte&s;t in&s;pection, into any approved Divine. I mu&s;t refer you to tho&s;e, who have treated the mat|ter,
<PB N="54" REF="66">
as it would go beyond our limits, to enter into particulars.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the Committee, is not accurate. Tho&s;e able Divines, who taught them, &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;chool to re-&s;tudy their le&s;&s;on. I grant, that, in &s;ome ca&s;es, an oath may be null and void, as when it is unlawful to be taken, then indeed there is no need of a di&s;pen&s;ation: but in the ca&s;es al|luded to, of an oath extorted, either by per&s;onal vio|lence, or &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity, the oath is not void, unle&s;s the thing promi&s;ed be wicked, or the oath be otherwi&s;e invalidated. A &s;imple promi&s;e given, and accepted, creates an obligation, in ju&s;tice, to the performance: &s;hould this promi&s;e be con|firmed, by oath, then there ari&s;es an obligation from the tie of religion. Force, violence or fraud would de&s;troy the obligation of ju&s;tice, ari&s;ing from the promi&s;e; but not the tie of religion, ari&s;ing from the oath: for although the man, who has extorted the oath, has no right to exact the performance; yet the reverence due to the &s;acred name of God, re|quires that I &s;hould perform, what I have &s;worn to do, when I can lawfully do it. This obligation therefore &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, until it is taken away, by di&s;|pen&s;ation. This is the doctrine of orthodox Di|vines; and would not have been called in que&s;tion, by the Committee Divines, but for the crooked purpo&s;es of worldly policy. When they, like Me|lancthon, had advanced too far to retreat, they were driven to the&s;e paltry &s;hifts to defend a bad cau&s;e. They may deceive the Committee, and perhaps
<PB N="55" REF="67">
them&s;elves too, but will never deceive an orthodox Divine of any information.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under favour, Sir, you are too hard upon tho&s;e good men, with whom the Committee have di&s;cu&s;|&s;ed this matter. By a di&s;pen&s;ation I under&s;tand, <HI>a declaration, that the law has cea&s;ed to bind.</HI> Hence the rea&s;ons for di&s;pen&s;ing are either good and &s;uffi|cient, and then nothing is wanted, but the declara|tion; or they are bad, and then no power on earth can or ought to grant a di&s;pen&s;ation. Now, Sir, it may happen that the rea&s;ons, for di&s;pen&s;ing, are too plain and obvious to &s;tand in need of a declaration, as is really the ca&s;e, where fraud or violence are made u&s;e of to extort an oath; and therefore no di&s;pen&s;ation is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>From one error you are driven to another. The fir&s;t error is, that no oath can be di&s;pen&s;ed with; to &s;upport this, you a&s;&s;ert another error, that all oaths made to God are vows. In oaths made to man, you again deny a power of di&s;pen&s;ing; ano|ther error; but finding that &s;ome &s;uch oaths admit of a di&s;pen&s;ation, you take your la&s;t refuge under the protection of a new definition of a di&s;pen&s;ation; and this definition is perhaps as erroneous, as any of your former a&s;&s;ertions. Pray, Sir, what orthodox Divine, ever before, gave &s;uch a definition? Even Canoni&s;ls are not &s;o loo&s;e: they give the following de&s;cription of <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation; it is a prudent relaxa|tion of the common law.</HI> Divines, however, are more accurate, and &s;ay; <HI>it is a prudent relaxation of the common law, in particular ca&s;es, where it would other|wi&s;e</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="68">
<HI>bind.</HI> This addition is only for the &s;ake of per|&s;picuity: for, even according to Canoni&s;ls, a di&s;pen|&s;ation is not a mere declaration that the law cea&s;es, but a relaxation of the law; then it takes away an obligation, which would otherwi&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Were your definition admitted, a di&s;pen&s;ation could not relea&s;e or take away any obligation, but only de|clare it already removed: now, Sir, let us &s;ee a few ab&s;urdities, which would nece&s;&s;arily follow: were there &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to grant a di&s;pen&s;ation for any of the impediments of matrimony, for example, for a &s;ub-deacon to marry; for cou&s;in-germans, &amp;c. &amp;c. the law would really be removed, previous to the di&s;pen&s;ation; and &s;hould the Pope refu&s;e to grant it, from whatever motives, and the parties marry without a di&s;pen&s;ation, the marriage would be va|lid: all that could be objected again&s;t &s;uch a mar|riage, would be, that it would be irregular; but it could not be void; becau&s;e the law forbidding the union had really cea&s;ed: a Deacon, Prie&s;t or Bi|&s;hop might pretend that he had rea&s;ons equally for|cible, in his favour; and, by the &s;ame rea&s;on, might marry, and might laugh at every command, or cen|&s;ure, which &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him.</P>
<P>I forbear urging this further. If you plea&s;e we will proceed to examine the next and la&s;t exception|able clau&s;e, in the oath, the infallibility of the &s;o|vereign Ponti&s;&s;.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreed: but I wi&s;h previou&s;ly to note, that we only deny his per&s;onal infallibility, independent of the general body of the Church. This &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="57" REF="69">
I can not &s;ee a difficulty; it is no part of our reli|gion, it is exploded from every univer&s;ity, and is not believed, by any one, on this &s;ide the Alps. Prote&s;tants think, that, if we believe the Pope to be infallible, he may command us to do what he plea|&s;es, and we are bound to obey. To remove this odium, we are called upon to renounce this infal|libility; if we do it, it will be one great means of rooting out the inveterate prejudices of our prote|&s;tant brethren, conceived on account of our &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ubjection to the See of Rome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very kind and indulgent to the pre|judices of Prote&s;tants: but why content them, by halves? Renounce the infallibility of the Church, and you will &s;atisfy them compleatly.</P>
<P>The opinion of the &s;overeign Pontiff's infallibi|lity is as harmle&s;s, as that of the Church's infallibi|lity; we are not bound to obey his <HI>commands,</HI> be|cau&s;e he is infallible; but becau&s;e he is our lawful &s;uperior; and this he certainly is, whether he is, or is not infallible; hence we are bound to obey, whenever his commands are just, though we &s;hould abjure this infallibility, which you affect to call <HI>per|&s;onal,</HI> or independent of the body of the Church; pray, Sir, what is the meaning of this? What other infallibility did Bellarmine contend for? Now, Sir, although a per&s;on &s;hould not allow of any &s;ort of infallibility, in his Holine&s;s, and therefore might lawfully &s;ign a declaration again&s;t it; yet no one I think can &s;wear again&s;t it. Might he not alter his opinion? how then could he take this oath, if ten|dered
<PB N="58" REF="70">
a &s;econd time? How terrible the con&s;equence of his refu&s;al? Should any one believe his Holine&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this prerogative, he could not take this oath; he mu&s;t then be branded with the titles of a dangerous &s;ubject, ho&s;tile and dangerous to the &s;tate; in one word, he mu&s;t be a modern Papi&s;t! What folly this? and how foreign to an oath of allegiance?</P>
<P>But, Sir, this is not all; the Committee, in their letter to the Catholics, have told us, that we are called upon to renounce this opinion, among others, as a <HI>pernicious</HI> doctrine. page 3. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If the doctrines prote&s;ted again&s;t, by the oath, be <HI>pernicious,&mdash;</HI>the propriety of the expre&s;&s;ion, Prote&s;ting Catholic Di&s;&s;enter, is unque&s;tionable."</Q> What the&s;e doc|trines are, they tell us a few lines below; among the re&s;t is, <HI>that the Pope is in&s;allible.</HI> It is then to be abjured, in the oath, as a <HI>pernicious doctrine.</HI> Will you &s;wear &s;imply, and without explication, that it is a pernicious doctrine, becau&s;e Prote&s;tants think it &s;uch?</P>
<P>By way of confirmation of what I have &s;aid before of that odious title, I &s;hall remark, from the &s;ame letter, ibid. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that, if, by the oath, any doctrine be prote&s;ted again&s;t, which is not pernicious: or, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> if any doctrine be prote&s;ted again&s;t, which is an article of faith, the preamble (the title Prote&s;ting Catholic Di&s;&s;enter) cannot be acquie&s;|ced in, by any Catholic, with a &s;afe con&s;cience."</Q> They promi&s;e to examine later, whether any doc|trines, abjured in the oath, be pernicious, or articles
<PB N="59" REF="71">
of faith; but this we are yet to look for. Now, Sir, I will a&s;&s;ert, 1. that the doctrine of the Pope's infallibility will never be proved pernicious to the &s;tate: 2. That &s;everal other doctrines abjured in the oath, are &s;o clo&s;ely connected with articles of faith, that without them faith it&s;elf would be altered: and this I hope I have proved: Then, Sir, no Catholic can, with a &s;afe con&s;cience acquie&s;ce, in the title, or take the oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think we are now at an end of our examina|tion, and I mu&s;t own that your rea&s;ons have not made me a convert Let every man therefore think for him&s;elf, and let him that can, take the oath. We need not quarrel for this difference of opinion in temporal concerns: if your delicacy will not allow you to take the oath, you ought not to hinder tho&s;e, who think they ought to &s;tand forth, and regain their rights as citizens, by removing the odium, which in|veterate prejudice has ca&s;ton their religion.</P>

<P>This doctrine is evidently calculated to de|&s;end and &s;upport a &s;chi&s;m among Engli&s;h Catholics. Although what I have &s;aid has not convinced you, that the oath contains heterodox doctrines; you &s;hould be convinced, that the que&s;tion, between us, is not purely of a political and temporal nature: no, Sir, it is of a <HI>dogmatical fact:</HI> which mu&s;t be ultimately &s;ubmitted to the &s;upreme eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court; that is, <HI>whether this oath does, or does not contain doctrines, which a Catholic cannot &s;ub&s;cribe to.</HI> When the &s;overeign Pontiff had condemned the five celebrated propo&s;itions of Jan&s;enius; his fol|lowers,
<PB N="60" REF="72">
after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, acquie&s;ced in the cen|&s;ure; but, to &s;upport their &s;inking cau&s;e, contended that the&s;e propo&s;itions were not found in the book intitled <HI>Augu&s;tinus:</HI> This al&s;o was condemned by the Pope, who declared, that they were really ex|tracted, from the &s;aid book, in the &s;en&s;e therein ex|pre&s;&s;ed. You know, Sir, that the Church di&s;per&s;ed aquie&s;ced, in the &s;entence; and that tho&s;e who ap|pealed from it, to a future General Council, were ever con&s;idered as cut off from the body of the Church. Should the &s;overeign Pontiff declare this oath unlawful to be taken, as incon&s;i&s;tent with faith, and ho&s;tile to &s;alvation, if the Bi&s;hops di&s;per&s;ed were &s;ilent, would you &s;till think it lawful; would you &s;till call it a mere temporal and political con|cern? if &s;o, what would become of the infallibility of the Church di&s;per&s;ed? Would not &s;uch or &s;uch|like pretences excu&s;e any &s;chi&s;matic that ever ex|i&s;ted? Indeed, Sir, if this que&s;tion were decided, by the Pope, and the Church di&s;per&s;ed did not reclaim again&s;t the &s;entence, I &s;hould think my&s;elf bound, in con&s;cience, not only to &s;ubmit to the decree; but al&s;o to &s;eparate from every refractory per&s;on, who &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, or appeal.</P>
