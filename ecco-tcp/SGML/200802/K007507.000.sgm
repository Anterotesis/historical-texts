<P>PROPOSALS FOR PUBLISHING BY SUBSCRIPTION, DEDICATED, WITH PERMISSION, TO THE MOST NOBLE THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY, <HI>A COMPLETE HISTORY</HI> OF THE ENGLISH STAGE. INTERSPERSED with a comparative and comprehen&s;ive review of the ASIATIC, the GRECIAN, the ROMAN, the SPANISH, the ITALIAN, the PORTU|GESE, the GERMAN, the FRENCH, and OTHER THEATRES from their ORIGIN to the PRESENT TIME; and involving BIOGRAPHICAL TRACTS and ANECDOTES, in&s;tructive and amu&s;ing, concerning a prodigious number of AUTHORS, COMPOSERS, PAINTERS, ACTORS, SINGERS, and PA|TRONS of DRAMATIC PRODUCTIONS IN ALL COUNTRIES; with an intention to place the STAGE IN GENERAL, and the ENGLISH STAGE IN PARTICULAR, in an eligible point of view, as an object of national con&s;equence, by con&s;idering it as a criterion of ta&s;te and a regulator of human manners. The whole written, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of intere&s;ting documents, collected in the cour&s;e of Five and Thirty Years, by MR. DIBDIN.</P>
<P>THIS work will be publi&s;hed on a fine wove paper, and with a beautiful new type by FRY, in THIRTY-FIVE Numbers, at ONE SHILLING each number, making, with the dedication and preface, which will be given as an addition to the la&s;t number, FIVE HANDSOME VOLUMES IN OCTAVO.</P>
<P>TO be continued MONTHLY, from the FIRST of MAY, 1797, on which Day the FIRST NUMBER will be publi&s;hed.</P>

<P>NEVER was there le&s;s difficulty in de&s;cribing the nece&s;&s;ity, the advantage, and the utility of a work than of this. To fa&s;cinate the mind into the exerci&s;e of morality, to ridicule folly into a love of &s;ocial duty, to inculcate virtue through the medium of plea&s;ure, and to beget an abhorrence of vice by rendering it hideous, was origin|ally intended by the in&s;titution, and has, to the infinite benefit of the mind, the gra|tification of the &s;en&s;es, and the improvement of the under&s;tanding, continued to be, but with little abatement, the province and operation of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>WITH the pulpit, and the bar, the &s;tage has ever been properly cla&s;&s;ed; and it will readily be granted that if the regulation and care of our religious principles, and the protection and &s;ecurity of our worldly property, are objects of national im|portance, the poli&s;h and refinement of our &s;ocial manners cannot make up an in|con&s;iderable part of our character as rational beings; &s;ince, without the inoffen&s;ive plea&s;ures of life, the more &s;erious con&s;iderations of &s;piritual and temporal concerns could no more render the enjoyments of the mind complete, than, without health, could the comforts of piety, and the advantages of fortune, tho&s;e of the body.</P>
<P>THIS publication, if it &s;hould be executed with full effect, will certainly operate to a mo&s;t eligible extent. To tho&s;e who chu&s;e to con&s;ider it &s;uperficially, it will yet be an important object, for, perhaps, more novelty and information will grow out of it than is contained in any work extant. As the anecdotes and the ob&s;ervations relate to all countries, and the Stage, in con&s;equence of conveying in&s;truction through its influence on the &s;en&s;es, has at all times boa&s;ted admirers, from its highe&s;t patrons down to the lowe&s;t orders of &s;ociety; it cannot fail of being in|tere&s;ting to every &s;ort of reader; to facilitate which, care will be taken to keep the &s;tyle of the narrative nervous, per&s;picuous, and &s;imple. To tho&s;e who have been de&s;irous, but not accu&s;tomed to read hi&s;tory, much information will be gathered from tho&s;e circum&s;tances in which &s;ome particular periods of the Stage will na|turally lead to an elucidation of national events.</P>
<P>AGAIN. The Hi&s;tory of the Theatre nece&s;&s;arily connects it&s;elf with the Hi&s;tory of the Opera. Mu&s;ic, therefore, as far as it relates to nature, and its effects on the pa&s;&s;ions, and which has been be&s;t felt through the medium of the Drama, will at different opportunities be treated on at con&s;iderable length; which will, of cour&s;e, branch out the &s;ubject into Dance, Pantomime, and all tho&s;e extraneous objects which, according as their modes of introduction have varried, have &s;ometimes cor|rupted, and &s;ometimes ornamented the Theatre; nor will Painting e&s;cape ob&s;erva|tion, that &s;o the Hi&s;tory of the Stage, as far as it goes, may comprehend a Hi&s;tory of the Arts.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3">IN &s;hort, there cannot be a &s;ubject &s;o full of intere&s;t, amu&s;em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, and in|&s;truction as the Stage.

An attempt, therefore, to review this exten&s;ive theme, and by compari&s;on to place the Engli&s;h Stage in a light &s;uperior to any other, is &s;ubmitted to the Engli&s;h reader in a more dige&s;ted form than has hitherto been attempted, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> as a cla&s;&s;ical work, in which the ta&s;te, the judgment, and the manners of the countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> are materially intere&s;ted.</P>
