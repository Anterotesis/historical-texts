<HEAD>THE VOYAGES OF CAPTAIN COOKE.</HEAD>
<P>THE rich cargo of the annual &s;hip from Ma|nilla to Acapulco, has ever been the ob|ject which private adventurers to the South Seas have had in view; while, on the other hand, the annual &s;hip from Acapulco to Manilla has been the pur&s;uit of the &s;hips of war. This difference has ari&s;en from the different con&s;titution of the two &s;hips; for the galleon, when &s;he &s;ets &s;ail from Manilla, being deep laden with a variety of bulky goods, (&s;uch as Chine&s;e &s;ilks and ma|nufactures, va&s;t quantities of Indian &s;tuffs, calli|coes, and chintz, be&s;ides the minuter articles of gold&s;miths work, embroidery, &amp;c. wrought at Manilla by the Chine&s;e,) &s;he has not the con|veniency of mounting her lower tier of guns, but generally carries them in her hold. Her hands too are as few as are con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afe na|vigation of the &s;hip, that &s;he may be the le&s;s en|cumbered by the &s;towage of provi&s;ions; &s;o that being but weakly manned, and indifferently pro|vided for defence, &s;he is thereby more expo&s;ed to the attacks of &s;mall privateers, and more ea&s;y
<PB N="2" REF="3">
to be made their prey; and, though &s;he does not contain &s;o great a trea&s;ure as the other, yet &s;he is &s;ufficiently rich to recompen&s;e the under|takers, and to enrich the captors, her cargo be|ing generally e&s;timated at three millions of dol|lars.</P>
<P>But the &s;hip from Acapulco making her re|turn chiefly in &s;ilver and gold, and having little or no bulky goods on board, as her cargo lies in le&s;s room, her lower tier is always mounted be|fore &s;he leaves the port, and her crew is aug|mented with a &s;upply of &s;ailors, and with one or two companies of foot, which are intended to reinforce the garri&s;on at Manilla. Be&s;ides, there being many merchants who take their pa&s;&s;age to Manilla on board the galleon, her whole number of hands on her return is u&s;ually little &s;hort of 600 fighting men; &s;o that &s;he is more than a match for &s;uch &s;mall privateers as are generally &s;ent upon hazardous expeditions, and a prize only for a royal &s;hip of war; and has therefore never been attempted by any other.</P>
<P>The voyage we are now about to relate was purpo&s;ely fitted out with a view to intercept the Manilla &s;hip at the in&s;tance of Dampier, in con|cluding of who&s;e character (from reading the accounts written by him&s;elf) we were led into an error, which the pre&s;ent voyage, written by Captain Cooke, has enabled us to correct. The ill &s;ucce&s;s that attended the voyage to the South Seas, under the immediate command of Dam|pier, of which a brief relation is given in the fir&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="4">
volume of this work, was &s;o far from di&s;courag|ing that enterprizing officer from pur&s;uing his favourite project of making prize of the Manilla &s;hip, that, after his return, when he had wearied the merchants of London with fruitle&s;s &s;olicita|tions, he repaired to Bri&s;tol, where his repre&s;en|tations were better under&s;tood, and where they were attended with better effect. By his &s;olid remon&s;trances he prevailed upon nineteen of the principal merchants and gentlemen of that city to unite and form a company, for the pur|po&s;e of fitting out two private &s;hips of war, to &s;hew what advantages might be derived from a well-conducted enterprize again&s;t the Spaniards in the South Seas: and it may, perhaps, be attri|buted to his judgment and experience, that they were more properly adapted to the &s;ervice on which they were to be &s;ent, and were better pro|vided again&s;t every accident to which they might be expo&s;ed, than any privateers that ever were fitted out before them. Add to this, that their crews were furni&s;hed with better regulations, and &s;ubjected to &s;tricter rules, and under &s;everer penalties, than men li&s;ted to go on hazardous adventures are generally willing to &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P>Their principal officers were gentlemen of experience, or highly intere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage; being the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cribers, and the chief promoters of the undertaking; and the&s;e al&s;o were a&s;&s;i&s;ted with a &s;econd &s;et of officers, equally able and experienced, who, in ca&s;e of accidents, were ready to &s;upply the places of tho&s;e who might be di&s;abled.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">But, be&s;ides being awed by penalties from tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing the articles of agreement that were &s;igned by every man on board from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, they were likewi&s;e encouraged by rewards to behave gallantly; every common &s;ailor who &s;hould lo&s;e a limb in time of action being entitled to a douceur of 30l. and &s;o in proportion to officers according to their re&s;pec|tive ranks: yet, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e pre|cautions, we find them ever ready to mutiny.</P>
<P>The two &s;hips, thus fitted up and regulated, were called the Duke and Dutche&s;s; the fir&s;t, of 300 tons, 36 guns, and 183 men, was com|manded by Woodes Rogers; the other, of 270 tons, 30 guns, and 151 men, by Captain Ste|phen Courtney.</P>
<P>Captain Rogers, who commanded in chief, was a bold, active man, an indefatigable officer, one who would not give up his opinion readily to others, nor be flattered by other people's giving up their opinion, without being convinc|ed, to him. He had been, according to Har|ris, a large &s;ufferer by the French, and was na|turally no great friend to that nation; but his mo&s;t &s;ingular quality, and that which indeed recommended him to this command, was a pe|culiar art he had of maintaining his authority, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;erving his influence, over his &s;eamen; an <HI>art,</HI> or <HI>gift</HI> rather, in which Captain Dampier was remarkably deficient.</P>
<P>Captain Courtney was a man of birth, for|tune, and of many amiable qualities; he con|tributed
<PB N="5" REF="6">
largely to the expence of the voyage, and took a &s;hare in it to &s;uperintend the ma|nagement, and to interpo&s;e and qualify the dif|ferences that might ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of a te|dious and dangerous navigation; being a per&s;on of an admirable temper, and remarkable for moderation in all his deci&s;ions, in which almo&s;t all men were ready to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e two gentlemen, who were fir&s;t in command, Dr. Thomas Dover (the &s;ame, who, about forty years ago, &s;o effectually re|commended the u&s;e of quick&s;ilver in a little book, entitled Dr. Dover's La&s;t Legacy to his Country, that ladies as well as gentlemen of rank and fortune be&s;pangled the floors and carpets with quick&s;ilver, and &s;cattered their diamonds wherever they met to dance, or to play) was &s;econd Captain on board the Duke; and Cap|tain Edward Cooke, our author, was &s;econd to Captain Courtney.</P>
<P>Dover was a con&s;iderable contributor to the voyage, but he was of a rough ungovernable temper, &s;eldom plea&s;ed with either mea&s;ures or men; but incapable of forming any party to &s;upport his own notions, becau&s;e no party could ever be brought to approve them.</P>
<P>Captain Cooke was an able and experienced &s;eaman, had been twice taken pri&s;oner, and twice relea&s;ed by the enemy, and now embarked his All in this bottom with a view to make one effort more to gain a fortune.</P>
<P>Captain Dampier, who projected the voyage,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
was made pilot on board the Duke to direct it. Of him the reader has already heard enough in the former volume of this Work; and from the character of the leaders it is natural to infer, that they were choice in the appointment of their in|ferior officers, and that even the common men were not of the meaner &s;ort.</P>
<P>The general in&s;tructions of the owners were, fir&s;t, to repair to Ireland to take in provi&s;ions, and then to proceed with all po&s;&s;ible expedition to the South Sea; if luckily they met with any prizes by the way, they were either to &s;end them home or to America, as &s;hould be&s;t &s;uit; they were ordered by all means to keep together, and to act in concert; to undertake no enter|prize of con&s;equence without fir&s;t deliberating the matter in a general council of officers in both &s;hips; to be particularly careful in a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other in every circum&s;tance of nece&s;&s;ity; and that in giving relief in times of danger, or in &s;upplying provi&s;ions or water in ca&s;e of want, they &s;hould be as one &s;hip, and that on no pre|tence the one &s;hould be &s;uffered to want while the other had any thing to &s;upply; but, as they were to &s;hare alike in all advantages, they &s;hould &s;hare alike too in all &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Thus fitted out and thus in&s;tructed, and the officers of both &s;hips being provided with legal commi&s;&s;ions to crui&s;e again&s;t her Maje&s;ty's ene|mies, the French and Spaniards, in the South Seas, on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1708, they un|moored from King-road, and on the 4th of the
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&s;ame month ca&s;t anchor at the Cove in Cork, where they continued victualling, and adju&s;ting their men, changing &s;ome and enli&s;ting others, among whom were many foreigners, till the fir&s;t of September, when they &s;ailed in company with the Ha&s;tings man of war, having fir&s;t a|greed, in ca&s;e of &s;eparation, to meet at Ma|deira, there to take in wine and brandy for the remainder of the voyage.</P>
<P>[Here it is nece&s;&s;ary to apprize the reader, that, as there are TWO very authentic accounts of this voyage, one written by Captain Rogers, and one written by our author, we &s;hall endea|vour to reduce them into ONE, by &s;upplying from Captain Rogers what is wanting in Cap|tain Cooke, and &s;hall, contrary to the method pur&s;ued in Harris, continue the narrative in the per&s;on of Captain Cooke, though &s;ometimes we may be obliged to u&s;e the words of Captain Rogers. And this being premi&s;ed, we will now proceed:]</P>
<P>On the 10th of September, &s;ays Captain Cooke, we &s;pied a &s;ail, which we chaced and came up with. She happened to be a Swede, bound for Cadiz; and though from &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances there was rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that &s;he had contraband goods on board, yet it being difficult to prove it, and we being in ha&s;te, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed her. This cau&s;ed a mutiny on board the Duke, headed by the boat&s;wain and three in|ferior officers, who per&s;uaded the men not to give her up. Captain Rogers confined the au|thors
<PB N="8" REF="9">
of this di&s;order, in which there was not one foreigner concerned. He put ten of the mutineers in irons, a &s;ailor being fir&s;t &s;oundly whipped for exciting the re&s;t to join him; others le&s;s guilty he puni&s;hed and di&s;charged; but the chief officers continued armed, fearing what might happen, the &s;hip's company &s;eeming too much to favour the mutineers. They had af|terwards a great deal of trouble with the&s;e fel|low, who did more mi&s;chief when in irons than before, by &s;tirring up the men to relea&s;e them, pretending that they &s;uffered in the cau&s;e of the crew, and therefore the crew ought to ri&s;e and relea&s;e them. This determined the Captain to make &s;ome examples, but not to irritate too much; he therefore began by removing the boat&s;wain from his office, and appointing ano|ther in his room, without intending any thing further. But on the 14th this inte&s;tine &s;torm ro&s;e higher than ever; for then a &s;ailor, with the be&s;t part of the &s;hip's company at his heels, went up to the Captain, and demanded the boat&s;wain out of cu&s;tody. With this man the Captain de&s;ired to &s;peak alone, and when he came upon the quarter-deck, the officers &s;eized him, and cau&s;ed one of his chief comrades to whip him. Thus by different corrections of the like kind, the officers on board the Duke broke the combination, and allayed the tumult. The boat&s;wain they &s;ent home in the Crown Gal|ley in irons; the other pri&s;oners they relea&s;ed upon their humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; &s;uch among
<PB N="9" REF="10">
them as were petty officers they re&s;tored to their commands, and all on board were forbidden to di&s;obey or reproach them: and thus ended an in&s;urrection, which, had it &s;ucceeded, would have put a &s;top at once to the farther pro&s;ecu|tion of the voyage.</P>
<P>On the 15th, finding our&s;elves to the &s;outh|ward, and at the &s;ame time &s;omewhat to the ea&s;tward of Madeira, we changed our place of rendezvous, and bore away for the Canaries.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 18th, at five in the morning, we &s;aw a &s;ail right a-head, to which we gave chace. About ten, we came up with, and took her, being a &s;mall Spani&s;h bark bound from Te|neriff to Fuertaventura, with &s;everal men and women pa&s;&s;engers on board, and laden with &s;undry &s;orts of goods. Next day we bore away for Oratavia-road, where we &s;tood off and on, and &s;ent away the prize's boat with one of our owner's agents, a prie&s;t, and the ma&s;ter of the prize, to treat about the ran&s;om of her, and to get wine, provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;aries, for the refre&s;hment of both the &s;hips. About eight next morning, a boat came from the town, with a letter from the Engli&s;h merchants re&s;iding there, wherein they expo&s;tulated with us for making prize of the bark, alledging that there was a free trade agreed to in the&s;e i&s;lands be|tween her Maje&s;ty of Great Britain and the Kings of France and Spain, &s;o religiou&s;ly ob|&s;erved by the latter, that they had cau&s;ed an Engli&s;h &s;hip taken there by a French privateer,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
to be re&s;tored; and farther, repre&s;enting the danger that might ari&s;e to them&s;elves, living by permi&s;&s;ion in an enemy's country, if the bark was not immediately given up, for which repri|&s;als would be made on them; as al&s;o, that we &s;hould be an&s;werable at home for interrupting the &s;ettled commerce. This letter was &s;igned by the Con&s;ul and three capital merchants. Our Captains immediately returned for an&s;wer, that, having no in&s;tructions relating to the Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els trading among tho&s;e i&s;lands, they could not ju&s;tify the relea&s;ing of the &s;hip on their bare opinions, without &s;ome order or proclamation of her Maje&s;ty, the Engli&s;h being protected there only on anchoring ground, and the bark being taken in the open &s;eas; that, in ca&s;e Mr. Van|brugh, the owners agent, was not re&s;tored, they would carry away all the pri&s;oners they had; and, if they apprehended any detriment to the factory, they might ran&s;om the bark, and &s;eek their redre&s;s in England. They de&s;ired di&s;patch, there being no time to lo&s;e; and, upon &s;ending back Mr. Vanbrugh, they would relea&s;e the pri|&s;oners. At night another letter came in an&s;wer to theirs, from the Con&s;ul, importing, that the Engli&s;h men-of-war were civilly received there, and never committed any ho&s;tilities; and that it was &s;trange we &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on ran&s;oming any Spaniards, who were never made pri&s;oners in England, or el&s;ewhere; and the Governor there delivered up to him any Engli&s;h pri&s;oners that were brought in by Spani&s;h privateers; where|fore
<PB N="11" REF="12">
he in&s;i&s;ted, that tho&s;e in our cu&s;tody &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the bark di&s;charged, accepting a pre&s;ent of wine in return. With this from the Con&s;ul at the city of Laguna, came another letter from the merchants at Oratavia-port, much to the &s;ame purport, only offering to pay to the value of 450 pieces of eight, the &s;um de|manded for the bark, in wine, brandy, &s;ugar, oil, barley, and greens, to prevent incen&s;ing the na|tives again&s;t them, not doubting but that repa|ration would be made them in England. Our Captains replied, by threatening to crui&s;e among the i&s;lands to avail them&s;elves for their lo&s;s of time, and to cannonade the town of Oratavia, unle&s;s they received in&s;tant &s;atisfaction. On the 22d, at four in the morning, we &s;tood in for the &s;hore, making a clear &s;hip; but, &s;oon after, we &s;aw a boat coming with our owners agent, and Mr. Cro&s;s, one of the Engli&s;h merchants, bring|ing five buts of wine, and other refre&s;hments. We lay off the town, took the goods out of the prize, &s;old the bark to Mr. Cro&s;s, and put the pri&s;oners on board her. Thus ended this trou|ble&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, which being unanimou&s;ly ap|proved of at a council of officers of both &s;hips, they proceeded on their voyage; and, &s;eeing a &s;ail to the we&s;tward, gave chace to her, but, night coming on, lo&s;t her.</P>
<P>On the 24th we cro&s;&s;ed the Tropic of Cancer, and, the Sunday following, performed the cere|mony of dipping the men of both &s;hips who had
<PB N="12" REF="13">
not cro&s;&s;ed it before; a ceremony that cau&s;es a good deal of mirth among the common men.</P>
<P>On the 30th we pa&s;&s;ed by Santa Lucia, one of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands, and by eight in the morning came in fight of St. Vincent, and about eleven came to an anchor in ten fathom water within the rock.</P>
<P>As we knew the i&s;land not to be inhabited, we were not a little &s;urprized to &s;ee &s;ome people on &s;hore; and, in order to learn who they were, and what their bu&s;ine&s;s was, I armed the pinnace, and went on &s;hore, when we found them to be Portugue&s;e come from the i&s;land of St. Anthony to catch turtle, who told us we might here wood and water.</P>
<P>This i&s;land lies in lat. 16 deg. 55 min. N. and in 25 deg. 36 min. W. long. from the meridian of London. There are on it Guinea-hens, hogs, and goats, and about the &s;hore plenty of fi&s;h. In the woods there are &s;piders as large as little birds, who&s;e webs are not ea&s;ily broken through, being woven with a &s;ub&s;tance nearly as &s;trong as ordi|nary thread.</P>
<P>The Cape Verd i&s;lands are eleven in number, St. Anthony, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, St. Nicholas, Sal, Bona Vi&s;ta, Mayo, St. Jago, Fogo, Romes, and Brava; and take their general name from a promontory on the African &s;hore. They belong to the Portugue&s;e, but are not all inhabited.</P>
<P>While we lay at St. Vincent's, new di&s;turbances aro&s;e among the men in relation to plunder; for
<PB N="13" REF="14">
here they had an opportunity of trading, and therefore every man wi&s;hed to have &s;omething to exchange. The effects taken in the late prize occa&s;ioned a general murmur throughout both the &s;hips; to put an end to which, and to fix the people in a firm re&s;olution of doing their duty, we determined to &s;ettle the matter at once, by framing &s;uch articles, as, without giving our owners any ground of complaint, might in&s;pire the &s;eamen with courage and con&s;tancy, and make them as willing to obey as their officers were ready to command. It co&s;t &s;ome trouble to adju&s;t the articles; but that was fully com|pen&s;ated, by their effectually an&s;wering the pur|po&s;e. And now, having compo&s;ed all differences, the men again chearfully returned to their duty, all but two or three of the Duke's men, who made their e&s;cape on &s;hore; among whom was their lingui&s;t, who probably had no mind to be left behind; but, having &s;taid beyond his leave of ab&s;ence, and paid no regard to the orders that were &s;ent him to repair on board, it was thought proper, by way of example, to depart without him. Accordingly on the 7th of October we unmoored, and, on the 8th, after lying by all night for our con&s;ort, we &s;et &s;ail together for the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il. But on our pa&s;&s;age thither, &s;ome fre&s;h di&s;putes aro&s;e among our men; and, after various con&s;ultations to accommodate the differences, it was re&s;olved, that Mr. Page, who was our &s;econd mate, &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;erve on board the Duke, and Mr. Ballet to come from
<PB N="14" REF="15">
the Duke to &s;erve on board the Dutche&s;s in his room. This was not to be effected without force, Page refu&s;ing to obey the order; and when it was on the point of being put in execu|tion, he re&s;i&s;ted; but, being overpowered, and carried on board the Duke, he was there charged with mutiny. He de&s;ired to go to the head, for a nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e, before he made his de|fence, and was permitted &s;o to do; when he in&s;tantly jumped over-board, with the de&s;ign of getting back again to the Dutche&s;s, but was taken up, tried, and puni&s;hed, which put an end to the di&s;turbance for that time.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 27th we cro&s;&s;ed the Line, and on Sunday the 14th of November &s;aw land at a great di&s;tance, and at noon made Cape Frio, on the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il. On the 18th we anchored before I&s;lo Grande, and on the 19th moored our &s;hip in ten fathom water. Here one of our men going from the &s;hip without leave, giving the fir&s;t Lieutenant foul language, and threatening &s;oon to be revenged, was put in irons; and his me&s;&s;mates and confederates de|manding his relea&s;e, or de&s;iring to &s;hare in his puni&s;hment, &s;even voluntarily went into irons.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t I went on &s;hore in the pinnace with a pre&s;ent to the Governor, and to acquaint him we were friends. At our fir&s;t landing they fired &s;everal &s;hot, taking us for French; but afterwards made an apology, and received us civilly. On the 23d two of the mutineers were whipped, and put in irons again. On the 24th
<PB N="15" REF="16">
four of the eight men in irons were relea&s;ed, on their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and two men went on &s;hore, de&s;igning to leave the &s;hip, and, having bar|gained with a canoe to carry them to the main, they were by mi&s;take put a&s;hore at a di&s;tant part of the i&s;land, where, finding them&s;elves on an uninhabited coa&s;t, they began to relent; and, after &s;taying a night in the woods, where they were terrified with the roaring of wild bea&s;ts, they came in &s;ight of the &s;hip, and made &s;igns of repentance, humbling them&s;elves in the mo&s;t &s;uppliant manner, and on their knees, with their hands lifted up, endeavouring to move compa&s;|&s;ion. After &s;ome time the boat went off, and brought them on board, where they were con|fined in irons till the next day, and then ordered to be flogged and relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 25th two Iri&s;h landmen &s;tole away from the Duke, and &s;ecreted them&s;elves in the woods, in like manner as the two &s;eamen had done from the Dutche&s;s. About four next morning the watch on the quarter deck &s;pied a canoe, and hailed her to come on board; but the rowers not an&s;wering, but &s;triving to e&s;cape, the Duke's pinnace pur&s;ued the canoe, fired into her, and mortally wounded one of the Indian rowers. He that owned and &s;teered the canoe was a friar, and had a quantity of gold on board, which, after running the canoe a&s;hore, he had ju&s;t time to hide before the Duke's pinnace reached the land. A Portugue&s;e, who was in the canoe, and who had no gold to lo&s;e, would not follow
<PB N="16" REF="17">
the friar; but, on the contrary, knowing the Engli&s;h to be friends, called the Father back, who, upon his return, was carried with the wounded Indian on board the Duke, where the poor man was dre&s;&s;ed by the &s;urgeon, but died in a few hours. The officers in both &s;hips were very &s;orry for this unfortunate accident, and en|tered their prote&s;t again&s;t it, and cau&s;ed the man to be buried on &s;hore in a very &s;olemn manner. The friar, however, who had lo&s;t his gold, was not to be appealed, but threatened to &s;eek for ju&s;tice in Portugal or England.</P>
<P>In towing the &s;hip about the ea&s;ternmo&s;t part of the i&s;land, we &s;pied the Duke's two men waiting tor a canoe to carry them over to the main; and two of our Lieutenants manned the boat, and, landing &s;ome men in a convenient place to get behind them, to prevent their e&s;|caping to the woods, they rowed to the place where the fellows were &s;een to lurk. When they found them&s;elves be&s;et, they endeavoured to fly; but, being intercepted, they were brought on board, put in irons, and &s;ent to their own &s;hip, where they were afterwards &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the 27th the principal officers on board both &s;hips went in their pinnaces to the town of Angra dos Reys on the main, carrying the &s;hips mu&s;ic along with them. They were kindly re|ceived and entertained by the Governor and Fa|thers, who with their &s;ervants are the principal inhabitants, there not being more than 50 or 60
<PB N="17" REF="18">
low-built hou&s;es in the place. They have a guard-hou&s;e, where, at our landing, we were received by the Governor, with about 20 men under arms, and treated with a dinner, &s;weet|meats, and rum. The Governor and Fathers de&s;ired we would go to &s;ee their Franci&s;can mona&s;tery and church, that day being a fe&s;tival with them, and the people coming from the plantations in the country to celebrate it. We complied; and, at their reque&s;t, our mu&s;ick, con|&s;i&s;ting of trumpets, hautboys, and violins, played in a gallery belonging to the church, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in heightening the &s;olemnization, to the no &s;mall &s;atisfaction of the Fathers. After divine &s;ervice we likewi&s;e joined in proce&s;&s;ion with them, and accompanied them from the church in the even|ing, every one carrying a large wax candle in his hand, according to the cu&s;tom of the coun|try on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The proce&s;&s;ion being clo&s;ed, we were conducted into a great hall, and treated by the Fathers with an elegant &s;upper of fi&s;h, &s;weet meats, and fruits of various &s;orts in the highe&s;t perfection. At our coming away, they gave us &s;ome vollies with their &s;mall arms, and we returned the compliment by a flouri&s;h of trumpets, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fifteen days journey up the country there is &s;aid to be a very rich gold mine; and it was not long &s;ince the French plundered a bark with 800 weight of gold-du&s;t on board, which it was bringing from the mine. Some men of credit told me, that the mines here are more
<PB N="18" REF="19">
profitable than even Mexico or Peru; but that the Tapoyars, who inhabit the inland plains, are an unconquerable race of men, taller and &s;trong|er than the Portugue&s;e, and not to be brought to labour. The Bra&s;ilian women are very fruitful, have ea&s;y labours, retire to the woods, where they are delivered alone, and return no more till after a certain time allotted for purification.</P>
<P>On tue&s;day the 30th of November we weighed anchor; but a tornado coming on, we tacked, and &s;tood under the i&s;land till its fury abated. On the 1&s;t of December both &s;hips &s;ailed out of the bay, and pur&s;ued their cour&s;e to the &s;outhward till the 21&s;t, without meeting with any remarkable occurrence; but on that day a young man fell from the mizen-top-&s;ail yard, and fractured his &s;kull.</P>
<P>On the 23d we made land, which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be Falkland's I&s;land, in lat. 51 deg. 25 min. S. by e&s;timation.</P>
<P>On the 24th, as we ran along &s;hore, the land looked like &s;ome part of England, having &s;eve|ral good bays and vallies, but believe it to be wholly uninhabited.</P>
<P>On the 5th of January, 1709, we had a vio|lent gale of wind at north-we&s;t, and very bad weather. At two in the afternoon we reefed both cour&s;es, then lowered our fore yard, and lay by till five, at which time our wa&s;te was filled with water, and we expected the &s;hip to &s;ink every moment: got down our fore-yard as
<PB N="19" REF="20">
well as we could, and loo&s;ed the &s;prit-&s;ail to wear the &s;hip, which at la&s;t we accompli&s;hed; but in wearing we thought we &s;hould have foun|dered with the weight of water that was in her wa&s;te. Thus we &s;cudded before the wind, the Duke following, and at nine &s;hipped a &s;ea in the poop, as we in the cabbin were going to &s;up|per. It beat in all the cabbin-windows and bulk-head, and hove the fir&s;t Lieutenant half|way between the decks, with &s;everal mu&s;kets and pi&s;tols that hung there, darting a &s;word that was again&s;t the bulk-head of the cabbin through my man's hammock and rug, which hung again&s;t the bulk-head of the &s;teerage; and, had not the bulk-head of the great cabbin given way, all we who were there mu&s;t inevitably have been drowned before the water could have been di&s;|charged. Our yaul was &s;taved on the deck, and it was a wonder that many were not killed with the &s;hutters, the bulk-head, and the arms, which were driven with a prodigious force; but Providence delivered us from this and many other dangers; only one man or two were hurt, and &s;ome brui&s;ed; but not one rag of dry cloaths was left us, our che&s;ts, beds, and bedding, be|ing all &s;oaked in &s;ea-water. Next day the &s;torm abated, and we continued our cour&s;e, coa&s;ting very far to the &s;outh, where we endured much cold, by which many of our men were greatly affected, in&s;omuch that a third part of both &s;hips companies fell &s;ick, occa&s;ioned, as I &s;up|po&s;e, by their being long wet and cold. We
<PB N="20" REF="21">
were now in lat. 61 deg. 48 min. S. long. from Falkland's I&s;les 18 deg. 5 min. W.</P>
<P>Monday 17, by a good ob&s;ervation I found that we were got round Cape Horn, Terra del Fuego, and the Straits of Magellan, and to the northward of Cape Vileria. On the 19th I reckoned we were to the northward of Port St. Stephen on the coa&s;t of Patagonia in the Great South Sea.</P>
<P>On Monday the 31&s;t, at eight in the morning, made the I&s;land of Juan Fernandes, where we de&s;igned to wood and water. In the afternoon Capt. Dover went off in the Pinnace to get &s;ome provi&s;ions, and in the evening &s;aw a fire a&s;hore, which made us conclude there were &s;hips in the road, as we were a&s;&s;ured the i&s;land had no inha|bitants: we therefore made the &s;ignal for the boat to return, and &s;he accordingly came on board about twelve at night.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day Feb. 1, we rowed and towed into the great bay, and came to an anchor in 50 fathom water. All this day we had a clear &s;hip expect|ing a rencounter; but were much di&s;appointed, when, in&s;tead of a valuable prize, we di&s;cover|ed only an odd figure of a man, who had been the &s;ole re&s;ident on the i&s;land for more than four years. His name was Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman, who had been Ma&s;ter of the Cinque|ports, the &s;hip that accompanied Dampier in his voyage to the South Seas, and was, as Dampier &s;aid, one of the be&s;t men in her. Captain Ro|gers immediately agreed with him to be his mate.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">It was this man who made the fire in the night when he &s;aw our &s;hips, which he judged to be Engli&s;h. During his &s;tay here, he &s;aw &s;everal &s;hips pa&s;s by; but only two came to an anchor. As he went to view them, he found them to be Spaniards, and retired from them; upon which they &s;hot at him. Had they been French he would have &s;ubmitted, but cho&s;e to ri&s;que his dying alone on the i&s;land rather than fall into the hands of the Spaniards, becau&s;e he appre|hended they would either murder, or make a &s;lave of him in the mines; for he feared they would &s;pare no &s;tranger that might be capable of di&s;covering the South Seas. The Spaniards had landed before he knew what they were, and they came &s;o near him that he had much ado to e&s;cape; for they not only &s;hot at him, but pur|&s;ued him to the woods, where he climbed to the top of a tree, at the foot of which they charged their pieces, and killed &s;everal goats ju&s;t by, but went off again without di&s;covering him. He told us, that he was born at Largo, in the county of Fife, and was bred a &s;ailor from his youth. The rea&s;on of his being left here was a difference between him and his Captain, which, together with the &s;hip's being leaky, made him willing rather to &s;tay here, than to go along with him at fir&s;t, and when he was at la&s;t willing to go his Captain would not receive him. He had been at the i&s;land before to wood and water, when two of the &s;hip's company were left upon it for &s;ix months, till the &s;hip returned, being
<PB N="22" REF="23">
chaced thence by two French South Sea &s;hips. He had with him his cloaths and bedding, with a firelock, &s;ome powder, bullets, and tobacco; a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a bible, &s;ome practical pieces, and his mathematical in&s;tru|ments and books. He diverted and provided for him&s;elf as well as he could; but for the fir&s;t eight months he had much ado to bear up a|gain&s;t melancholy, and the terror of being left alone in &s;uch a de&s;olate place. He built two huts in Piemento-trees, covered them with long gra&s;s, and lined them with the &s;kins of goats which he killed with his gun as he wanted, &s;o long as his powder la&s;ted, which was but a pound, and that being almo&s;t &s;pent, he got fire by rubbing two &s;ticks of Piemento wood toge|ther upon his knee. In the le&s;&s;er hut, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the other, he dre&s;t his victuals, and in the larger he &s;lept, and employed him&s;elf in reading, &s;inging p&s;alms, and praying; &s;o that he &s;aid he was a better Chri&s;tian while in this &s;olitude than ever he was before, or than, he was afraid, he &s;hould ever be again.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he never eat any thing till hunger con&s;trained him, partly for grief, and partly for want of bread and &s;alt, nor did he go to bed till he could watch no longer. The Piemento wood, which burnt very clear, &s;erved him both for fire and candle, and refre&s;hed him with its fragrant &s;mell. He might have had fi&s;h enough, but could not eat them for want of &s;alt, becau&s;e they occa&s;ioned a loo&s;ene&s;s, except crayfi&s;h,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
which are as large as lob&s;ters, and very good. The&s;e he &s;ometimes boiled, and at other times broiled, as he did his goat's-fle&s;h, of which he made good broth. He kept an account of 500 that he killed while there, and caught as many more, which he marked in the ear and let go. When his powder failed he took them by &s;peed of feet, for his way of living and continual ex|erci&s;e cleared him of all gro&s;s humours, &s;o that he ran with wonderful &s;wiftne&s;s through the woods and up the rocks and hills, as we per|ceived, when we employed him to catch goats for us. We had a bull-dog which we &s;ent with &s;everal of our nimble&s;t runners to help him to catch goats; but he di&s;tanced and tired both the dog and the men, caught the goats, and brought them to us on his back. He told us that his agility in pur&s;uing a goat had once like to have co&s;t him his life. He pur&s;ued it with &s;o much eagerne&s;s that he catched hold of it on the brink of a precipice of which he was not aware, the bu&s;hes hiding it from him; &s;o that he fell with the goat down the precipice a great height, and was &s;o brui&s;ed with the fall that he narrowly e&s;caped with his life; and, when he came to his &s;en&s;es, found the goat dead under him. He lay there about twent-four hours, and was &s;carce able to crawl to his hut, which was about a mile di&s;tant, or to &s;tir abroad again in ten days. He came at la&s;t to reli&s;h his meat without &s;alt or bread. He had a con&s;tant &s;up|ply of good turneps, which had been &s;own there by
<PB N="24" REF="25">
Captain Dampier, and have now over&s;pread &s;ome acres of ground. He had good cabbage from the cabbage-trees that grow wild upon the i&s;land, and &s;ea&s;oned his meat with the fruit of the Piemento-trees, which is the &s;ame as Jamai|ca pepper, and &s;mells deliciou&s;ly. He found al&s;o a black-pepper, called Malageta, which was very good to expel wind and &s;trengthen the &s;to|mach. He &s;oon wore out all his &s;hoes and cloaths by running in the woods; and at la&s;t, being forced to &s;hift without them, his feet be|came &s;o hard, that he ran every where without difficulty; and it was &s;ome time before he could wear &s;hoes after we found him; for, not being u&s;ed to any &s;o long, his feet &s;welled when he came to wear them again. After he had con|quered his melancholy, he diverted him&s;elf &s;ome|times with cutting his name upon the trees, &s;ome|times with contrivances to vary and increa&s;e his &s;tock of tools, and &s;ometimes in clear evenings in counting the &s;tars. He was at fir&s;t much pe&s;tered with cats and rats that had bred in great numbers from &s;ome of each &s;pecies which had got a&s;hore from &s;hips that put in there to wood and water. The rats gnawed his feet and cloaths while he &s;lept, which obliged him to cheri&s;h the cats with his goat's fle&s;h, by which many of them became &s;o tame, that they would be about him in hundreds, and &s;oon delivered him from the rats. He likewi&s;e tamed &s;ome kids; and, to vary his diver&s;ions, would now and then &s;ing and teach them to dance; &s;o that

by his natural flow of humour, and the vigour of his youth, being now but 30 years old, he came at la&s;t to conquer all the inconveniences of his &s;olitude, and to be very ea&s;y. When his cloaths were worn out, he made him&s;elf a coat and a cap of goat's &s;kins, which he &s;titched to|gether with little thongs of the &s;ame that he cut with his knife. He had no other needle but a nail; and, when his knife was worn out to the back, he made others of &s;ome iron hoops that were a&s;hore, which he beat thin, and ground upon &s;tones. Having &s;ome linnen cloth by him, he &s;ewed him&s;elf &s;ome &s;hirts with a nail, and &s;titched them with the wor&s;ted of his old &s;tockings, which he pulled out on purpo&s;e. He had his la&s;t &s;hirt on when we found him on the i&s;land. At his coming on board us, he had &s;o much forgot his language for want of u&s;e, that we could &s;carce under&s;tand him; for he &s;eemed to &s;peak his words by halves. We offered him a dram; but he would not touch it, having drank nothing but water &s;ince his being there; and it was &s;ome time before he could reli&s;h our victuals. He could give us no account of any other product of the i&s;land than what we have mentioned, except &s;ome black plumbs, which are very good, but hard to come at, the trees which bear them growing on high mountains and rocks.</P>
<P>The officers that went fir&s;t on &s;hore were in|vited to his retreat; but the way to it being very rugged and intricate, only a very few of

them had curio&s;ity enough to vi&s;it it, He had conceived an irreconcileable aver&s;ion to an offi|cer on board the Cinque Ports, who, he was in|formed, was on board the Duke; but, not be|ing a principal in command, he was prevailed upon to wave that circum&s;tance, and to accom|pany Captain Dampier, for whom he had a friend&s;hip. He was very u&s;eful while the &s;hips &s;taid at Juan Fernandez, in &s;upplying them with fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and in facilitating the bu&s;ine&s;s of taking in wood and water. He &s;aid, he had &s;een &s;now and ice in July, which is the middle of winter in that climate; but the months of September, October, and November, are incon|ceivably plea&s;ant; the air being perfumed with a fragrance that cheri&s;hes and revives the &s;pirits, and has a wonderful effect upon animals, as well as men, which Selkirk remarked by their play|wardne&s;s and plumpne&s;s. He particularly di|rected us to a plant not much unlike feverfew, of a mo&s;t grateful and cordial &s;cent, with which we &s;trewed the tents of the &s;ick, who were there|by much comforted, and their cure facilitated. We gathered many bundles of it, dried them in the &s;hade, and &s;ent them on board.</P>
<P>On the 13th of February, a general council of officers was held on board the Duke, when many nece&s;&s;ary regulations were agreed to, for the maintenance of order, di&s;cipline, and &s;ecrecy; among which, two in&s;pectors were appointed from on board the Duke, to take account of all p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">s taken by the Dutche&s;s; and the like
<PB N="27" REF="29">
number from the Dutche&s;s, to regi&s;ter &s;uch as &s;hould be taken by the Duke.</P>
<P>While we continued in this bay the carpen|ters fitted up the pinnaces, the frames of which were ready prepared at Bri&s;tol, at our fir&s;t &s;et|ting out.</P>
<P>On the 14th the pinnaces were launched, and having each a gun fitted to her prow, were tried in the bay, to &s;ee how they would &s;ail, being in|tended to &s;erve as &s;mall &s;hips of war, to examine the harbours where the large &s;hips could not venture to approach the &s;hore. And now, hav|ing all things in readine&s;s, we began to prepare for our departure, all our &s;ick men being re|covered, except two who died, and were buried on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 15th we cleared the bay, and pur&s;ued a northerly cour&s;e till the 24th, when we cro&s;&s;ed the Tropic of Capricorn, and &s;hot &s;ome Tropic birds about the &s;ize of a partridge, with only a &s;ingle feather in their tails, but that very long, and very taper. We had now the &s;ea as &s;mooth as a pond; and, having little to do, we ordered the men to attend prayers regularly twice a day, prohibited gaming, to prevent the artful from taking advantage of the &s;imple; and impo&s;ed a penalty again&s;t &s;wearing, by which that vice was almo&s;t excluded the &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>On Monday the 28th I ordered three of our men to be put in irons, for cutting the meat in the &s;teep-tub, and hiding it; and on the 2d of
<PB N="28" REF="30">
March, Captain Courtney cau&s;ed them to be whipped and pickled, by way of example.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day he 14th of March, Captain Rogers, Captain Dover, and Captain Dampier, came on board the Dutche&s;s; and concluded, that the &s;trict, ob&s;ervation of Lent having pre|vented the Spaniards from trafficking in tho&s;e &s;eas, the mo&s;t eligible plan would be to bear away under an ea&s;y &s;ail for Lobos, and there to &s;upply our&s;elves with boats to land at Guaya|quil; but in the afternoon &s;aw a &s;ail, gave chace, and took her She came from Guayaquil, and was bound for Cheripe to load flour, and had been out 16 days. The crew were all Indians, except one Spani&s;h pa&s;&s;enger. They had no|thing on board but about 50 l. in money to pay for their cargo, and told us, that part of the new town of Guayaquil had lately been burnt; that the Je&s;us Maria, formerly a man-of-war, was coming from Lima to be there rebuilt; that another large &s;hip was expected from Panama at Payta; and that they had heard nothing of any Engli&s;h men-of-war or privateers being in tho&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>On the 16th we made the i&s;land of Lobos, and in the evening anchored in the road. It lies in lat. 6 deg. 5 min. S. about 16 leagues from the continent, is barren, and affords neither wood nor water; but there is good riding for &s;hips, and harbours proper for repairing and careening. Here the prize was fitted up, and it was agreed, that I &s;hould go out in her with 35 men, to crui&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="31">
in company with the Dutche&s;s; and with that view &s;he was new named, and called <HI>The Begin|ning Galley.</HI></P>
<P>On the 26th, at day-break, we &s;aw a &s;hip &s;tanding to the &s;outhward, and &s;oon came up with her. She was a bark of 50 tons, bound from Guayaquil to Truxillo, with timber and cocoa-nuts. It was agreed, that Captain Courtney &s;hould &s;tand in with her in the night; and that I &s;hould continue to crui&s;e till farther orders, which on the 27th I received, and the &s;ame even|ing came to an anchor by the Duke and Dutch|e&s;s in Lobos-Road. Next day, the pri&s;oners be|ing examined, reported, that a &s;hip of 36 bra&s;s guns was expected from Lima with the Viceroy of Mexico and his mother on board; and that they were bound to Panama. Upon this intelli|gence it was re&s;olved in full council to crui&s;e in que&s;t of this &s;hip, and if &s;he e&s;caped to attack Guayaquil.</P>
<P>While the Duke lay at Lobos, the carpenters built a large boat to land men, in ca&s;e of an at|tack; and, having made all nece&s;&s;ary prepara|tions, and the &s;ick men from both &s;hips being put on board the la&s;t prize, which was called the <HI>Increa&s;e,</HI> our fir&s;t Lieutenant was ordered to command the <HI>Beginning Galley</HI>; and on the 31&s;t of March we left Lobos, and agreed to crui&s;e &s;ix leagues to the windward of the Saddle of Payta, as the mo&s;t likely &s;tation to &s;ucceed in our enterprize.</P>
<P>On the 2d of April we fell in with a large
<PB N="30" REF="32">
&s;hip, of 400 tons, from Panama, heavily laden with dry goods, commanded by Captain Morel, and thought to be one of the large&s;t merchant-&s;hips in all tho&s;e &s;eas. He had 50 or 60 blacks on board, be&s;ides &s;everal pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>The next day we took another prize of &s;mall value, having only about 90 or 100 l. in plate, and a &s;mall quantity of timber. She was of 50 tons burthen, commanded by Juan Perezillo Ba&s;tillo, who told us that a bi&s;hop was coming by &s;ea from Panama to Lima with 200,000 pieces of eight, and a con&s;iderable quantity of family plate; but no &s;hip appearing in &s;ight from the 3d to the 9th, it was then upon con|&s;ultation agreed to call in the crui&s;ers, and to attempt the conque&s;t of Puna and Guayaquil. This re&s;olution being taken in council, it was next debated, who &s;hould command in chief on &s;hore; and, after a warm conte&s;t, it was at length agreed, that Captain Rogers and Captain Court|ney &s;hould each command a company of &s;eamen, and Captain Dover a party of landmen; that Captain Dover &s;hould give the word of command the fir&s;t night, and the other two Captains take their turns.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 10th, Mr. Vanbrugh, the owner's agent, was removed from the council, and Mr. Samuel Hopkins was cho&s;en in his room; the charge again&s;t him was founded on killing the Indian, as already mentioned, and engaging to vote with Captain Rogers upon all occa&s;ions. Captain Dover likewi&s;e charged
<PB N="31" REF="33">
him with in&s;olence, and with di&s;obeying or|ders.</P>
<P>On the 12th, the attack of Guayaquil was finally &s;ettled, and the whole fleet &s;et &s;ail for that harbour. Some new regulations were framed, and fre&s;h encouragement propo&s;ed to animate the men to behave re&s;olutely.</P>
<P>The three commanding officers &s;elected each their re&s;pective parties, Captain Dover the ma|rines, and the Captains Rogers and Courney two parties of &s;ailors, 75 men in each; Cap|tain Dampier commanded the artillery, and was to form a body of re&s;erve, to act as occa&s;ion &s;hould offer. The whole number employed in this &s;ervice amounted to 238 effective men. The care of the &s;hips and prizes was at the &s;ame time entru&s;ted to the Captains Cooke and Fry, who, be&s;ides a &s;mall complement of &s;ailors, had 226 Indians and blacks on board.</P>
<P>Friday 15. Saw a &s;ail near the &s;hore, and, having little wind, the Duke's boat commanded by Captain Fry, and ours by my&s;elf, made di|rectly for her, going off in &s;uch ha&s;te that nei|ther of us had the &s;wivel guns we u&s;ed to carry, nor our full complement of men. The Duke's boat nearing her fir&s;t, &s;he put out Spani&s;h co|lours, fired a gun, and hoi&s;ted her Spani&s;h flag at the main-top-ma&s;t head. The Duke's boat then lay by for us to come up. We &s;aw &s;he was French-built, and, by the de&s;cription the pri&s;oners had given us, concluded it mu&s;t be the &s;hip we had been &s;o long crui&s;ing for, which
<PB N="32" REF="34">
was to carry the Bi&s;hop. Our &s;hips being almo&s;t out of &s;ight, and the Spaniards &s;o near the coa&s;t, we re&s;olved to lay her on board on each bow, and accordingly fell to it. The di&s;pute was hot for a long time, we keeping a con&s;tant fire, and the enemy returning it, who killed two of Captain Fry's men, be&s;ides wounding one of his and two of mine. One of the killed was Mr. John Rogers, our &s;econd Lieutenant, and brother to Captain Rogers. The Duke's boat, finding the enterprize de&s;perate, bore away; and &s;ome time after we did the like: but Cap|tain Fry having put &s;ome of his men aboard of us, given us &s;ome powder and &s;hot, and taken in our wounded, I made again to the chace, re|&s;olving to keep her from the &s;hore, and, rather than fail, to clap her aboard. The Spaniards, perceiving our de&s;ign, edged off to &s;ea, and we followed them. Our &s;hips came up apace, and the Dutche&s;s having fired a &s;hot or two, &s;he &s;truck her colours, and &s;urrendered. The men begged for good quarter, and we promi&s;ed them all civility. This &s;hip came from Panama, and was bound for Lima, to be fitted out for a man of war. There were 70 blacks, and many pa&s;|&s;engers, with a con&s;iderable quantity of pearls, on board: the lading con&s;i&s;ted of bale goods, and &s;ome things belonging to the Bi&s;hop; but they had &s;et him, with his attendants, a&s;hore at point St. Helena, from whence he was to go by land to Guayaquil. While the French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this ve&s;&s;el, &s;he was called La Lune d'Or. She
<PB N="33" REF="35">
was of 270 tons burden, and commanded by Don Jo&s;eph de Arizabella.</P>
<P>Saturday 16. Took a &s;mall bark laden with hides and &s;ome flour, and buried our Lieute|nant, being all much concerned for the lo&s;s of &s;o good an officer.</P>
<P>Sunday 17. All things being now in order, our men went aboard the two barks in order to land, and Captain Fry and I took charge of the &s;hips, prizes, and pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Monday 18. At one in the morning, being near the i&s;land Santa Clara, our two barks with the land forces left us.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 19. The boats rowed with 45 men towards the i&s;land Puna, and came to a grap|pling clo&s;e under the land, out of &s;ight of the look-outs. We &s;eized the Governor of the i&s;land, and &s;ent our carpenter and two or three hands along the &s;hore, to cut all the bark-logs, and canoes in pieces, for fear they &s;hould get away and alarm the town of Guayaquil.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 21. I &s;ent the Beginning a-head, for fear of danger, who, &s;eeing a ve&s;&s;el riding clo&s;e under point Arena, fired two &s;wivel guns at her; but found nobody on board. She was a new Spani&s;h bark going to load &s;alt, and had nothing in her but a few jars of water. At five in the afternoon the tran&s;ports rowed for the town of Guayaquil, and at eleven at night were &s;o near as to hear one centinel call to another for fire to be brought. Perceiving we were di&s;|covered, we rowed over to the other &s;ide, and
<PB N="34" REF="36">
&s;aw a fire made where the centinels talked, and &s;oon after many lights all over the town. We heard them likewi&s;e ring the alarm-bell, and fire &s;everal volleys; and we ob&s;erved them to light a fire on the hill to give the town notice of our being come up the river. Hereupon the boats came to a grappling, when &s;uch a hot di&s;|pute aro&s;e among &s;ome of our chief officers, that they were heard a&s;hore; the officers differ|ing in their opinions, whether to land immedi|ately, or &s;tay till morning; however, at la&s;t it was agreed, that, &s;ince we did not know the ground, it was be&s;t to &s;tay till day-light.</P>
<P>Friday 22. Our forces being all joined, we &s;ent a flag of truce, with the Captain of the French-built &s;hip, and another pri&s;oner, to the Corregidor, who a&s;ked him our number, which the Captain magnified. The Corregidor &s;ugge&s;ted that we were mere boys; but the Captain re|plied, he would find we were men, for we had fought him bravely in our open boats, though he had killed one of the Commander's brothers, and wounded and killed others; and therefore advi&s;ed him to agree for the ran&s;om of the town.</P>
<P>Saturday 23. The pinnace went up the river after &s;ome ve&s;&s;els, and brought &s;ix of them to anchor by our barks; and we al&s;o took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of two new &s;hips, of about 400 tons each. We then went a&s;hore with a flag of truce, and the Governor came on board to agree about the ran&s;om of the town and &s;hips; but this not
<PB N="35" REF="37">
being then concluded, he promi&s;ed to meet the Captain at &s;even in the evening, but was not &s;o good as his word.</P>
<P>Sunday 24. The Governor came off again to treat, and our Captains would have &s;eized him for having forfeited his word; but he al|ledging that it was incompatible with his com|ing with a flag of truce, was &s;et a&s;hore again, and all things were made ready for the attack. Accordingly the men landed, and, being com|manded to proceed, they went on with &s;o much bravery, that the Spaniards fired only their fir&s;t volley and fled, our people pre&s;&s;ing and pur&s;u|ing them to their cannon, which they &s;oon de|&s;erted, the gunner only, who was an Iri&s;hman, &s;tanding by them till he was wounded in four places, of which wounds he &s;oon after died. Our men then marched in a body through both towns, drove out the enemy, and, placing three guards in the three churches, &s;et fire to five or &s;ix hou&s;es adjoining to the wood, le&s;t the enemy &s;hould annoy our guard, which was within pi&s;|tol-&s;hot. All this night they kept firing out of the woods at our centinels, but did them no harm. In the mean time the Dutche&s;s's pin|nace, commanded by Lieutenant Connely, went up the river, landed at every hou&s;e, took the plate, and what el&s;e of value they found, and had &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes with the enemy, in which one of our men was wounded.</P>
<P>Monday 25. In the night one of our centi|nels &s;hot another belonging to us, who was go|ing
<PB N="36" REF="38">
from his po&s;t, and did not an&s;wer when challenged three times; our fir&s;t Lieutenant's pi&s;tol went off by his &s;ide, and wounded him in the leg; and another of our men was al&s;o &s;hot through the foot by one of our own people: moreover, our &s;urgeon cut off a man's arm who had been hurt by one of our grenadoe &s;hells, which broke in the bark when fired out of the cohorne. The afternoon was &s;pent in &s;hipping off provi&s;ions from the town, and di&s;po&s;ing all things in ca&s;e of an attack in the night.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 26. A flag of truce came to treat concerning ran&s;oming the town, which was at la&s;t agreed on for 30,000 dollars. We were to have three ho&s;tages, and to &s;tay at Puna till they could rai&s;e the money.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 27. The ho&s;tages came on board; and we took down our Union flag, and hoi&s;ted a flag of truce, firing a gun for a &s;ignal that the Spaniards might come into the town, and that no farther ho&s;tilities &s;hould be committed on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 28. Our barks weighed with the beginning of the ebb, the Duke's pinnace making the be&s;t of her way down to the &s;hips; and the float, after going a&s;hore to fetch off the great guns, weighed al&s;o, and fell down the ri|ver.</P>
<P>Friday 29. Captain Rogers came aboard, and gave us an account that they had taken, plundered, and ran&s;omed the town of Guaya|quil; that three of our men had been killed,
<PB N="37" REF="39">
two by our own people, and one by the Spa|niards, and four wounded, that the inhabitants, whil&s;t treating, had carried off their money and plate, retiring to the woods, and leaving their guns, four whereof were taken, with a con&s;i|derable quantity of meal, pea&s;e, &s;ugar, brandy, and wine, all which was coming down in the barks. This day Hugh Tidcomb, who was &s;hot by his fellow-centinel, died. At four in the afternoon, &s;pied a &s;ail &s;tanding up the river with the tide of flood: we &s;ent both &s;hips boats after her, and before night they brought her in. She was a &s;mall Spani&s;h bark from Cheripe, having on board 330 bags of meal, 35 hundred weight of &s;ugar, &s;ome onions, quinces, and pomegranates. This, with the &s;ix barks, and two great &s;hips ran&s;omed by the town of Guayaquil, made fourteen prizes taken in tho&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>Sunday 30. Captain Rogers went aboard the French built &s;hip to carry her up to Puna, in hopes of di&s;po&s;ing of her cargo and &s;ome of the blacks, who only &s;erved to eat up our provi|&s;ions; as al&s;o to bring down what water and provi&s;ions could be got; Captain Courtney being gone there before on the &s;ame account.</P>
<P>Monday, May 1. A boat came down from the town with part of the ran&s;om, whereupon mo&s;t of the pri&s;oners were &s;et on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 5. Captain Rogers returned with the French-built &s;hip, the Spaniards having brought none of her cargo; but they had paid
<PB N="38" REF="40">
24,000 dollars, part of the 30,000 ran&s;om; upon which, the Governor of Puna, one of the ho&s;ta|ges, was di&s;charged, but the others kept.</P>
<P>Friday 6. In the afternoon the Duke and the prizes joined us, when we were &s;even &s;ail in all. A boat came down with about 3000 dollars more, in money and plate; and the men told us, that the other 3000 dollars would &s;oon come, and 12,000 more to purcha&s;e goods: but this we &s;uppo&s;ed to be a trick to keep us till the men-of-war &s;hould come from Lima; whereupon we made all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch to get out of the bay, kept three of the ho&s;tages, and &s;ent the pri|&s;oners a&s;hore. The Beginning, being of no other u&s;e, &s;ince we had better ve&s;&s;els, we &s;old to the Spaniards for the value of 50l. in pearl, gold chains, &amp;c. and put the pri&s;oners aboard, but kept pilots, and a man that could &s;peak Engli&s;h, the Pre&s;ident of Panama's &s;on, and the ho&s;tages. The weather being very hot, &s;ome of our men fell into fevers; and in a few days we had near 100 &s;ick, and among the number Capt. Court|ney.</P>
<P>Sunday 8. Sailed with a &s;mall breeze at N. W. At noon it began to blow fre&s;h; but nothing material happened till the 13th, when, believing our&s;elves near the longitude of the Gallapagoes, where we de&s;igned to water, fit our &s;hips, and refre&s;h our men, we lay by from &s;ix in the even|ing till four the next morning, for fear of run|ning by tho&s;e i&s;lands in the night.</P>
<P>Monday 16. Mr. Hopkins, Lieutenant of the
<PB N="39" REF="41">
marines, and one of the doctors of the Duke, died.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 17. Saw land, being one of the Gal|lapagoe i&s;lands. Next day the Duke's boat went on &s;hore to &s;eek for water, but could find none in any of them, tho' Captain Cowley, in his voyage round the round, &s;ays there is good water in one of them; but we mi&s;&s;ed the place.</P>
<P>The 20th, 21&s;t, and 22d, we &s;pent in plying among the i&s;lands, where the boats found abun|dance of turtle, large rock-fi&s;h, and guanos. The&s;e la&s;t named creatures are larger here than tho&s;e in other parts of the We&s;t Indies, and are of &s;everal colours and &s;izes. They are eaten by the &s;eamen, and reckoned good meat, though their deformity made me loathe them.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 26. Captain Rogers and Captain Dover came aboard the Dutche&s;s, and, after holding a council, it was re&s;oled to run in for the i&s;land of Plata to water, and &s;o come off again, for fear of meeting with two French &s;hips, one of 60, and the other of 46 guns, and the Spani&s;h men-of-war, which, we were told, would be &s;hortly in &s;earch of us. Some days before this we lo&s;t Mr. Hatley, who was in one of the prizes, with five or &s;ix white men, four blacks, and an Indian, having on board little or no pro|vi&s;ions or water, and no boat; and we never more heard of them.</P>
<P>Monday 30. The officers of the Duke came aboard, to con&s;ult about the propere&s;t place to ca|reen and water at; and 'twas agreed to go to the
<PB N="40" REF="42">
i&s;land Gorgona, to &s;ee whether any Spani&s;h &s;hips were there, and from thence to Mangla, where are &s;ome indians, enemies to the Spaniards, who, it was &s;aid, would &s;upply us with &s;wine and fowls, good water, turtle, plantains, and other refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, June 1. Some of our men were told, that a con&s;piracy was forming on board the galleon among the pri&s;oners and blacks. We examined the Spaniards, who prote&s;ted they knew nothing of it; then put matches between the fingers of two blacks, making them believe we would burn them to the bone if they would not confe&s;s. They owned there had been a talk of killing the Engli&s;h among the Indians and blacks, but they believed it was not in earne&s;t; however, they were di&s;per&s;ed into &s;everal &s;hips to break, the combination.</P>
<P>Sunday 5. Saw a &s;ail right-a-head of us, chaced, and at eight in the evening came up with her, fired a chace-gun, and &s;he &s;truck. The ve&s;&s;el was of about 80 tons burden, bound from Panama for Guayaquil, was laden with iron and other merchandize, and had two wo|men and &s;everal pa&s;&s;engers of note on board, one of whom was going Governor to Baldivia, who&s;e name wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Don Juan Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o, and who had been not long before taken on the other &s;ide by the Jamaica cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ers.</P>
<P>Monday 6. Made the be&s;t of our way for Gorgona; and at three in the afternoon next day, the Duke with the galleon came to an an|chor
<PB N="41" REF="43">
in that harbour. Same day &s;aw a &s;ail bear|ing down towards the i&s;land, till &s;pying the gal|leon in the offing, &s;he &s;tood to the we&s;tward. I went out in the pinnace well-manned, and at noon took and brought her to an anchor. She was a bark of 50 tons, called El Soldado, came out of a &s;mall port the night before, and was bound for Guayaquil, to load &s;alt, brandy, &amp;c. She had in her in gold chains and money to the value of 5 or 6 hundred pounds, de&s;igned to pur|cha&s;e her cargo.</P>
<P>Monday 13. Held a full council on board the Duke, and re&s;olved to careen our &s;hips here as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Here we continued till Sunday, Augu&s;t the 7th; and in the mean time plundered a &s;ettlement on the main, right oppo|&s;ite the i&s;land, &s;et mo&s;t of our pri&s;oners on &s;hore on the continent, and brought &s;even beeves, 14 hogs, &s;ome poultry, about 50 bu&s;hels of Indian wheat, and a few goats on board: at the &s;ame time a black born in Jamaica, who &s;poke very good Engli&s;h, and had been taken with &s;ome Jamaica-men eight years before, came over to us in a canoe. Captain Morel, too, formerly com|mander of the galleon, brought &s;ome money and fruit, and a merchant or two, who bought &s;ome of our blacks. During our &s;tay at this i&s;land, Captain Rogers, Captain Courtney, my&s;elf, and &s;ome other officers, underwent much fatigue in fitting up the Marquis, for which &s;hip we were forced to get entirely new ma&s;ts and yards, make mo&s;t of the &s;ails, and a great deal of new cor|dage.
<PB N="42" REF="44">
The &s;mith al&s;o made much new work; as did the carpenters, &s;ail makers, riggers, and rope-makers, who all came to help us from each &s;hip.</P>
<P>The 6th of Augu&s;t, I received my orders to command the Marquis, carrying 20 guns, 60 white men, and 16 blacks; and, the &s;hips having taken in their loading from the prizes, and all our bu&s;ine&s;s being over at the i&s;land of Gorgona, we weighed anchor at 10 in the morning, and ran to the north of the i&s;land: but the ma&s;ts of the Marquis being new and heavy, and a great weight of goods between decks, I found &s;he proved crank, and &s;ailed dull upon the wind; &s;o that the Duke and Dutche&s;s were fain to &s;pare a great deal of &s;ail for me to keep up with them.</P>
<P>Friday 12. Held a con&s;ultation about &s;end|ing the Marquis and a bark laden with bale-goods directly for India, to &s;ave provi&s;ions and gain time; but this was oppo&s;ed by Captain Courtney, and others, in regard to the Marquis, which being a good ve&s;&s;el, might be of great u&s;e in ca&s;e we &s;hould meet with the Manilla &s;hip, or the men-of-war we &s;uppo&s;ed were look|ing for us.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, Augu&s;t 18. At &s;ix in the morning &s;aw a &s;ail a-head, gave chace, and the Dutche&s;s &s;oon coming up with her, and firing a few guns, &s;he &s;truck, being a bark of about 70 tons, bound from Panama to Troxillo, with merchants goods, pa&s;&s;engers, and blacks, on board. The ma&s;ter told us, he had been detained three months at Panama by an embargo, which being taken off
<PB N="43" REF="45">
upon advice that we were going to the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, he had &s;et &s;ail. Enquiring what &s;hips were out in que&s;t of us, the pri&s;oners &s;aid, they had advice at Panama of five or &s;ix &s;hips being ordered after us, two of them French, of 48 guns each, and &s;ome Spani&s;h, of the like force, and good &s;ailors. They could tell no other news, than that the whole coa&s;t was alarmed.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 19. The Duke and Dutche&s;s fired &s;ome vollies to exerci&s;e their men. Next day we fell in with land about a league to the lee|ward of Tacames, ran within a league of the &s;hore, and on the 24th ca&s;t anchor in the bay, from whence the Dutche&s;s &s;ent her pinnace a&s;hore for water, but could get none. Tacames is a village of only &s;even hou&s;es and a church, &s;tanding in a bay, about &s;even leagues to the northward of Cape Franci&s;co. The hou&s;es are built of &s;plit bamboes, and covered with Pal|meto-leaves, &s;tanding on &s;tilts or po&s;ts; and, in|&s;tead of &s;tairs, they have a piece of timber cut in notches to a&s;cend by. The men employ them&s;elves in killing wild &s;wine with bows and arrows, and &s;triking fi&s;h with their lances, at both which they are very dexterous. The wo|men have only a piece of baize tied about their middle, and carry their children at their backs. They are under the authority of the Spani&s;h prie&s;ts, and are not permitted to trade without their licence.</P>
<P>On the 27th. They received a letter of leave,
<PB N="44" REF="46">
and our boats went a&s;hore to the hou&s;es for cattle; and on the 28th and 29th continued trading and watering till we had &s;ufficiently &s;upplied the &s;hips. In return for the civility of the&s;e Fathers, I &s;ent as a pre&s;ent to the church at Tacames four large images, one of which was the Virgin Mary with our Lord and Saviour in her arms; and I believe Captain Rogers and Captain Courtney al&s;o gave &s;omething to adorn their church. On Wedne&s;day the 31&s;t of Augu&s;t we &s;et &s;ail, the wind being at S. W.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, Sept 1. Saw abundance of water-&s;nakes, one of which was coming up the &s;ide of our &s;hip, and our men beat it off. The Spa|niards &s;ay, there is no cure for &s;uch as are bit by them; and one of our blacks happened to fall under that misfortune, and died, notwith|&s;tanding the utmo&s;t care was taken by our &s;ur|geons to recover him.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, Sept. 7. Made one of the Gallapagoe i&s;lands. On the 10th, &s;tood clo&s;e in for the head-land, &s;ending our boat on &s;hore for water and turtle. At night our boat came aboard, bringing 13 turtle, &s;ome weighing 200 weight; the other boats got near 50 each; and the Dutche&s;s's &s;everal land-turtle, but no water. Our men &s;aw &s;everal jars, and &s;ome of the wreck and rudder of a ve&s;&s;el, and &s;hould have gue&s;&s;ed it to be the prize, Captain Hatley, lo&s;t when here before, but the rudder was too &s;mall for her.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 14. The Dutche&s;s, Marquis, and &s;mall prize, weighed, ran out, and lay by for the
<PB N="45" REF="47">
Duke, which could not get out for want of wind. On the 15th, &s;et &s;ail in the morning; and, con|&s;idering the &s;un was directly over our heads, the weather was cold, occa&s;ioned, as I believe, by the &s;outherly winds, which are colde&s;t in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, Sept. 22. The Marquis kept the pump continually going, having &s;prung two leaks, not being well caulked at Gorgona; there|fore weared her on the other tack, and &s;topt one leak, but could not find the other, being about the &s;tern. Weared again, and &s;tood to the we&s;t|ward.</P>
<P>Friday 22. At a con&s;ultation on board the Duke, it was agreed to &s;teer to the i&s;lands Ma|rias, for a convenient place to refit, wood, and wa|ter; then to crui&s;e in que&s;t of the Manilla &s;hip, which was large, and of great value, being re|ported by the Spaniards to be worth 2,000,000 &s;terling.</P>
<P>On the 3d of October. Cape Corientes ap|peared, bearing N. E. 10 leagues; and on the 4th in the morning we made the i&s;lands called Tres Marias, at the di&s;tance of about 16 leagues; but could not fetch them till the 6th, when we got under the lee of one of them. I lay off with the &s;hip, and &s;ent the boat a&s;hore for water and turtle; but neither the one nor the other was to be got, becau&s;e of the &s;urff.</P>
<P>Before our coming to this place, we di&s;cover|ed the white rock, formerly mentioned by Dam|pier, and took it for a &s;hip; on the &s;ight of which the Dutche&s;s let go the bark &s;he had in tow, tel|ling
<PB N="46" REF="48">
her to make the be&s;t of her way to the middle i&s;land; under the lee of which both the Duke and Dutche&s;s came to an anchor on the 7th and 8th; and I might have been there as &s;oon, had I not &s;een the bark &s;ix or &s;even leagues to lee|ward. It was fortunate that I came in time to relieve her, otherwi&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have peri&s;hed, having neither wood nor water on board, and not being able to make up again&s;t the wind and current to reach the land. I bore down to her, &s;upplied her wants, and took her in tow till the 20th in the morning, when the middle i&s;land bearing north, di&s;tant about &s;even leagues, we &s;aw a &s;ail coming from the i&s;land before the wind, which proved the Dutche&s;s, who came in &s;earch of us, and was glad to find us &s;afe; brought us &s;ome water and turtle, and told us there was game enough in the i&s;land, if we could bear up to it. Captain Courtney took us in tow, to help us in the &s;ooner, having cleaned his &s;hip's bot|tom before he &s;et &s;ail to come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 11th, I came to an anchor, after much trouble and fatigue in plying &s;o long again&s;t the wind and current. Seven of Captain Rogers's be&s;t blacks this day left him, and ran away. We continued in this bay till</P>
<P>Monday the 24th, when a general council was held, at which it was re&s;olved to crui&s;e off Cape St. Lucas for the Manilla &s;hip, all our &s;hips be|ing now very well fitted, wooded, watered, and provided with turtle. Several warm debates hap|pened in council among our chief officers; and,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
Captain Dover quitted the Duke, and went on board the Dutche&s;s, by his own free choice. I endeavoured to accommodate the&s;e differences, but to no purpo&s;e, which gave &s;everal of us great concern.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands of Tres Marias, where we anchor|ed, abound with animals of various kinds, and the &s;hores with fi&s;h; among the&s;e the &s;ea and land turtle may be accounted of mo&s;t u&s;e to na|vigators. Of the &s;ea-turtle there are various &s;orts; as the green, which are the &s;weete&s;t and be&s;t; the hawk's-bill, which are very good; and the logger-head, which the &s;ailors never re|fu&s;e when the others are not to be caught. The method of taking them is by turning them, and when they are on their backs, they appear as in the Plate, fig. 1.</P>
<P>The land-turtle lives con&s;tantly a&s;hore, feeds upon gra&s;s, moves very &s;low, and, when an enemy approaches, covers it&s;elf under its &s;hell, &s;quatting clo&s;e to the ground, from which it is not ea&s;ily di&s;cernible, appearing like a bare patch without verdure. The &s;hells of the&s;e animals are &s;o hard, that a man may tread upon them without hurting them. Their fle&s;h is very good and nouri&s;hing. They will live five or &s;ix weeks without food, and appear to be never the wor&s;e. They lay round eggs, about the &s;ize of a hen's, and are very good to eat. Some of the &s;ea-turtle taken in the bay where we anchored had 200 eggs in them. Our men liv|ed almo&s;t wholly upon turtle, and their eggs, from the time they went fir&s;t to the Gallapagoes
<PB N="48" REF="50">
till their departure for the Ea&s;t Indies, &s;aving their &s;hip-provi&s;ions till their run acro&s;s the South Seas. For the land-turtle, &s;ee fig. 2.</P>
<P>At the&s;e i&s;lands our men caught plenty of the fi&s;h called old wives. They have very &s;mall mouths, large eyes, a high fin on the back, and &s;haped as you &s;ee fig. 3. The colour of the body is a deep blue; the fins of a lighter colour, tipped with yellow. Others are of an a&s;h colour on the back, and white under the belly.</P>
<P>The rock-fi&s;h we caught in the i&s;land of Tres Marias were large, had great mottled fins, yellow backs, red bellies, and red and black tails. See fig. 4.</P>
<P>Another fi&s;h our men caught was the cavallo, in &s;hape not much unlike the dolphin, with a large bright eye, black back, white belly, a long &s;treak from his gills to the middle of his tail, and is about the &s;ize of a mackarel. See fig. 5.</P>
<P>A &s;mall fi&s;h we found there, about &s;ix inches long, was very delicious; the back of an indigo blue, a deep yellow &s;treak running from the gills to the tail, the belly white, and the tail forked. It &s;eems peculiar to the&s;e i&s;lands, and wants a name. See fig. 6.</P>
<P>Of the animals, the racoon was the mo&s;t plen|tiful. It has a large black eye, whi&s;kers and no&s;e like a pig, tail and feet like a rat, a browni&s;h fur on his back, and a white belly. See fig. 7.</P>
<P>Of the venomous creatures, the &s;corpion is the mo&s;t noxious; its tail is jointed with a &s;mall &s;ting at the tip; it has two claws like tho&s;e of

<PB N="49" REF="52">
the lob&s;ter; and its head and feet have a near re|&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the &s;ame fi&s;h. See fig. 8.</P>
<P>Among the &s;inging-birds found in tho&s;e i&s;lands, the cardinal bird was &s;een in greate&s;t abundance. It is a very beautiful bird, with &s;carlet feathers, and on its head the male has a tuft of the &s;ame colour. They are of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e we call the Virginia Nightingale; but the Spaniards call them cardinal birds, from their &s;carlet feathers. See fig. 9.</P>
<P>Among the vegetables we found the Mag|ney-plant, or &s;ilk-gra&s;s, of which the Indians make ropes, &s;ails, &s;acks, and all their curious netting. It al&s;o yields a liquor of which they make wine, honey, and a good bal&s;am. The liquor as it comes from the plant is as &s;weet as &s;ugar; after &s;tanding it becomes a wine, and will intoxicate powerfully. It has thick juicy leaves, not unlike tho&s;e of the hou&s;eleek, but grows up to a con&s;iderable height in the form repre&s;ented by fig. 10. And, when it has &s;tood about &s;ix years, the Indians cut out the middle leaves, leaving the heart of the plant hollow, which of it&s;elf fills with the juice, and is every morning during the &s;ea&s;on taken out and pre&s;er|ved. Of this juice the Spaniards make &s;pirits; and it is &s;o univer&s;ally u&s;ed in one &s;hape or other by the Spaniards and Indians in New Spain, that the duty ari&s;ing from it in one year is &s;aid to have amounted to 110,000 pieces of eight at the port of Angels alone.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53">The prickly tree found on tho&s;e i&s;lands is e&s;teem|ed a great curio&s;ity. The trunk of it is angular, and covered with prickles; is of a pale green, and yields a gum which the druggi&s;ts call euphor|bium, which is &s;aid to be powerful in removing pains in the head. It grows about 12 feet high, in the form repre&s;ented in the plate, fig. 11.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the principal peculiarities ob&s;erv|able in the animal and vegetable tribes at the i&s;lands of Tres Marias.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, Oct 2, at two in the afternoon, we weighed, and &s;et &s;ail for Cape St. Lucas, where we &s;pread our&s;elves for fear the Manilla &s;hip &s;hould pa&s;s by un&s;een. The Duke crui&s;ed about two leagues to the &s;outhward of the Dutche&s;s, the Dutche&s;s in the middle, and the Marquis two leagues to the northward of her. Place of rendezvous &s;ix or &s;even leagues in &s;ight of Cape St. Lucas.</P>
<P>Nov. 1. The Marquis &s;prang two great leaks, and broke the collar of the fore-&s;tay, which obliged me to wear the &s;hip to fix the &s;tay, and then hauled up after the other &s;hips, and &s;top|ped the leaks.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 2. All the officers and men on board the Marquis &s;igned an in&s;trument, oblig|ing them&s;elves to &s;tand by the articles agreed to by the companies of the other &s;hips.</P>
<P>Nov. 4. I &s;poke with Captain Courtney, and changed &s;tations with him, he having better boats than mine to &s;end a&s;hore for water and
<PB N="51" REF="54">
turtle; or, in ca&s;e of &s;eeing the Manilla &s;hip, to prevent her &s;ending the pa&s;&s;engers a&s;hore with their wealth. The 10th, the Duke and Dutche&s;s having &s;poken with each other, changed &s;tations, the Duke going in for the &s;hore, and the Dutch|e&s;s off to the outward &s;tation.</P>
<P>Nov. 22. Captain Rogers informed me, that the bark and his boat had been in with the &s;hore, and had &s;poken with the natives, who &s;eemed very civil, and had pearl and &s;ome grain to di&s;|po&s;e of; and that there was wood and water enough. Nothing material happened till</P>
<P>Dec. 13, when we had a con&s;ultation on board the Dutche&s;s, to enquire into the &s;tock of provi&s;ions on board the &s;hips, and found by the accounts given in, that only three months meat at &s;hort allowance, and two months bread, re|mained unexpended; and, as there was no ap|pearance of the Manilla &s;hip, though the u&s;ual time of her coming was elap&s;ed, it was agreed to make all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch in fitting up the &s;hips, in order to make the be&s;t of our way acro&s;s the Pacific Ocean, that we might take the advantage of the trade-winds to carry us to Guam on our return home. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, I was ordered into harbour, as the Marquis want|ed more con&s;iderable repairs than either of the other two, and the Duke and Dutche&s;s pro|po&s;ed to crui&s;e a few days longer, while I was getting forward to be in readine&s;s to accompany them to Europe.</P>
<P>On the 14th, I bore away for Puerto Segura,
<PB N="52" REF="55">
and on the 15th entered the harbour at mid|night.</P>
<P>On the 16th proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s, my fir&s;t orders being to return again to crui&s;e as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; but the&s;e orders were afterwards coun|termanded, it being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that all the &s;hips &s;hould rendezvous together before their final departure from the American coa&s;t.</P>
<P>This place is inhabited by about 200 Indians, living in huts made of boughs of trees and reeds, built like a bower, with a fire in the middle, round which they lie and &s;leep. They all go naked, only the women have &s;hort petticoats made of &s;ilk gra&s;s, or el&s;e of pelicans or deers &s;kins. The men are &s;traight, and well limbed; live by fi&s;hing and hunting, and value knives, &s;ci&s;|&s;ars, nails, or iron, beyond gold and &s;ilver. They have long black hair, and are of a dark brown complexion. The women are very ordinary, and employ them&s;elves in gathering and grinding corn, and in making fi&s;hing-lines. They are very hone&s;t and very civil. They a&s;&s;i&s;ted in fit|ting up the &s;hips, and took nothing away but what was given them. Our people at their fir&s;t coming got &s;ome pearls among them, but I ne|ver could &s;ee any afterwards. I made &s;igns for them to bring gold; but they pointed up to the mountains. They u&s;e bows and arrows, and even the boys are &s;o dexterous as to kill birds flying with them.</P>
<P>Dec. 22. Being bu&s;y about our repairs, at 10 in the morning heard &s;ome guns firing in the
<PB N="53" REF="56">
offing: I bent my &s;ails to ha&s;ten to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my con&s;orts, but the &s;ea breeze coming on rendered it impo&s;&s;ible; whereupon I a&s;cended an adjacent hill, and &s;aw our &s;hips engage and take the Manilla &s;hip, which we had been &s;o long expecting,</P>
<P>The account Captain Rogers gives of the en|gagement is as follows: <Q REND="inline">"At day-break, &s;ays he, we &s;aw the chace upon our weather-bow about a league from us, the Dutche&s;s a-head of her to leeward, near about half as far. Towards &s;ix in the morning our boat came on board, having kept very near the chace all night, and received no damage; but told us the Dutche&s;s pa&s;&s;ed by her in the night, and &s;he fired two &s;hot at him; but they returned none. We had no wind, but got out eight of our &s;hip's oars, and rowed about an hour, when there &s;prung up a &s;mall breeze. I ordered a large kettle of chocolate to be made for our &s;hip's company, having no &s;pirituous li|quors to give them. Then we went to prayers; and before we had concluded, were di&s;turbed by the enemy's firing at us. They had barrels hanging at each yard-arm that looked like pow|der-barrels, to deter us from boarding them. About eight o'clock we began to engage her by our&s;elves, for the Dutche&s;s being to leeward, and having little wind, did not come up. The enemy fired her &s;tern chace upon us fir&s;t, which we returned with our fore-chace &s;everal times, till we came nearer, and went clo&s;e on board each other. We gave her &s;everal broad&s;ides, plying
<PB N="54" REF="57">
our &s;mall arms very bri&s;kly, which they return|ed as thick for a while, but did not ply their great guns with the &s;ame alacrity. After &s;ome time, we &s;hot a little a-head of them, lying thwart her haw&s;e, clo&s;e aboard; and plied her &s;o warmly, that &s;he &s;oon &s;truck her colours two-thirds down. By this time the Dutche&s;s came up, and fired about five guns, with a volley of &s;mall &s;hot; but the enemy, having &s;ubmitted, made no return. We &s;ent our pinnace on board, and brought the Captain with the officers away; and, having examined them, found there came another &s;hip out from Manilla with them of larger burden, having about 40 bra&s;s guns mounted, and as many patararoes; but they told us they lo&s;t her company about three months ago, and reckoned &s;he was got to Acapulco be|fore this time, &s;he &s;ailing better than this &s;hip.
<P>This prize was called by the &s;welling name of No&s;tra Signiora de la Incarnacion De&s;engenio, Sir John Pichberty Commander. She had 20 guns, 20 patararoes, and 193 men on board, whereof nine were killed, ten wounded, and &s;e|veral blown up with powder. We engaged them about three gla&s;&s;es, in which time we had only my&s;elf and another man wounded. I was &s;hot through the left check; the bullet &s;truck away part of my upper jaw, and &s;everal of my teeth, part of which dropt down upon the deck where I fell; and the other, an Iri&s;h landman, was &s;lightly wounded in the hip. They did us
<PB N="55" REF="58">
no great damage in our rigging, but their &s;hot di&s;abled our mizzen-ma&s;t. I was forced to write what I had to &s;ay to prevent the lo&s;s of blood, and becau&s;e of the pain I &s;uffered by &s;peaking.</P>
<P>On the 23d of December, after putting our &s;hips to rights, we &s;tood in for the harbour, which was di&s;tant about &s;even leagues to the N. E. Our &s;urgeons went on board the prize to dre&s;s their wounded men. About four in the afternoon we came to an anchor, and received the compli|ments of all on board the Marquis on our &s;ud|den and unexpected &s;ucce&s;s, which gave us no &s;mall &s;atisfaction. We found that &s;hip in good condition, ready to &s;ail, and all the men on board her very bri&s;k, and eager for action.</P>
<P>At eight in the evening, we held a con&s;ulta|tion on the two great points; fir&s;t, what &s;hould be done with the pri&s;oners and ho&s;tages; and next, how we &s;hould act with regard to the other Manilla &s;hip, which we thought at lea&s;t there was a great probability of taking.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, we propo&s;ed, as the ho&s;tages from Guayaquil were men of honour, and as we had good rea&s;on to believe that the Chevalier Pichberty, being brother to the famous M. du Ca&s;s, was the &s;ame, to make the be&s;t terms we could with them, and &s;et them at liberty. Accordingly, we put a part of the goods on board the bark into the prize, and then offered the remainder with the bark, together with what remained unpaid of the ran&s;om, for 6000 pieces of eight, and to take the Chevalier's bills pay|able
<PB N="56" REF="59">
at London for the money. This they ac|cepted, and gave us an acknowledgment at the &s;ame time, that they thought it a good bargain. When this was &s;ettled, we had nothing more to do than to provide for our own &s;ecurity, and to look after the other galleon.</P>
<P>I was very de&s;irous of going out with the Dutche&s;s to crui&s;e for her; but there having been &s;ome reflections ca&s;t, on account of the Dutch|e&s;s's not engaging our la&s;t prize &s;o &s;oon as it was thought &s;he might have done, Captain Courtney was ab&s;olutely bent on going out with the Mar|quis; and the officers of both &s;hips voting for this in council, my propo&s;al was over-ruled, and we were forced to &s;tay in the harbour again&s;t our will. It was, however, agreed, that we &s;hould put 10 of our be&s;t hands on board the Dutche&s;s; and on Chri&s;tmas-eve &s;he and the Marquis &s;ail'd."</P></Q>&mdash;We now return to Captain Cooke in the Marquis.</P>
<P>Sunday 25. At eight in the morning, being two leagues off Cape St. Lucas, we &s;aw a &s;ail di&s;|tant about &s;even leagues, which we concluded to be the &s;hip we were in pur&s;uit of. The Dutch|e&s;s was two leagues to the we&s;tward, and we both gave chace. At noon the enemy bore &s;outh, di&s;tant about five leagues. At 12 at night, the Dutche&s;s got along-&s;ide, and began to engage her. Captain Courtney fought her bravely about four gla&s;&s;es, and then lay by to &s;ecure his ma&s;ts, and knot his rigging, which were much wounded and &s;hattered. Our &s;hip not being &s;o
<PB N="57" REF="60">
good a &s;ailor as the Dutche&s;s, could not come up.</P>
<P>Monday 26. As &s;oon as it was day, we &s;aw the Spaniard's flag, and knew him to be the Ad|miral of the Manilla. At eight we perceived the Duke coming out to us. At two in the after|noon we got along&s;ide the enemy; but the wind &s;hifting, could fetch no nearer than about half mu&s;ket-&s;hot to leeward of her. She then fired two &s;hot at us, and we returned a broad&s;ide and vollies of &s;mall arms, beginning the combat with three cheers. When we had fought two gla&s;&s;es, the Dutche&s;s came up under her &s;tern, and raked her fore and aft, and then fell a&s;tern again, we &s;till continuing hot at her for five gla&s;&s;es: then weared, and &s;tood to the we&s;t|ward, to fetch nearer up to her; for firing &s;o many guns had laid us to leeward. The Dutch|e&s;s went up, and engaged again very bri&s;kly for half an hour, and then &s;tretched a-head of her. We could perceive many &s;hot in her be|tween wind and water. At five we tacked, and raked her fore and aft with our &s;tarboard broad|&s;ide, then weared under her &s;tern, and did the &s;ame with our larboard broad&s;ide; and firing &s;everal vollies while we loaded our larboard guns again, gave her the other broad&s;ide. By this time it grew dark, and we fell a &s;tern, to &s;peak with the Dutche&s;s, and to get more ammunition, having but three rounds of &s;hot for mo&s;t of our guns left. At eight I went on board the Dutch|e&s;s, and found her much di&s;abled in her ma&s;ts
<PB N="58" REF="61">
and rigging, and had &s;even men killed and wounded. Capt Courtney and I agreed to be yard-arm and yard-arm with the enemy in the morning, he to lie on the bow, and I on the quarter; and if he boarded, I was to clap him aboard, and enter my men over him. Being &s;upplied with more ammunition, I returned on board the Marquis, both of us keeping clo&s;e under the chace's quarter, and firing guns all night, to annoy the enemy, and to give the Duke notice where we were. Before day the Duke joined us. The chace, mi&s;taking him for her con&s;ort, had made &s;ignals all night, and had edged away to meet him, otherwi&s;e the Duke could not have come up, there being but very little wind, and that contrary.</P>
<P>Then we all three agreed to fall upon the ene|my at once, as &s;oon as it was light; but while we lay athwart her haw&s;e, tho&s;e guns that mi&s;&s;ed the enemy flew through the Duke's ma&s;ts and rigging, which obliged him to change his &s;tation, and to draw up along-&s;ide clo&s;e aboard her, where he kept up a con&s;tant fire of round &s;hot, all other &s;hot proving ineffectual, becau&s;e of the &s;trength of the &s;hip's &s;ides, which no other &s;hot would penetrate; and as none of the Spaniards appeared in &s;ight, but all kept to clo&s;e quarters, it was in vain to make u&s;e of &s;mall arms, except now and then, when a man appeared to ob&s;erve our &s;ituation, and to keep an eye upon their en|&s;ign. In this manner, the Dutche&s;s lying upon her haw&s;e, the Duke along her broad&s;ide, and
<PB N="59" REF="62">
the Marquis athwart her &s;tern, we kept pelting her for four gla&s;&s;es; and, in the mean time, the Duke received a &s;hot in his main-ma&s;t, which much di&s;abled it; and, in &s;hifting, both he and the Dutche&s;s came back clo&s;e under the enemy, and had like to have been all aboard her. The Duke, in endeavouring to recover his &s;tation, received a fire ball, which lighting upon his quarter deck, blew up a che&s;t of arms and car|touch-boxes, all loaded, and &s;everal cartridges of powder in the &s;teerage, by which means Mr. Vanbrugh, our agent, and two others, were very much burnt; the Dutche&s;s going to la&s;h to the enemy, was forced to ca&s;t off, and get clear, for fear of being &s;et on fire. The enemy fired at us all three at once, but &s;lowly, &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ing our ma&s;ts and rigging, and &s;ometimes hulling us. After lying near half an hour along the chace's &s;ide, the Dutche&s;s lay by to &s;top her leaks, and &s;ecure her fore-ma&s;t, being very much di&s;abled, having 25 men killed and wounded, and the &s;ails and rigging much &s;hattered. Captain Rogers &s;ome time after lay by to &s;ecure his ma&s;t. Then I lay athwart the enemy's haw&s;e till I had fired three broad&s;ides, &s;ome odd guns, and &s;everal vollies; then gave another broad&s;ide and &s;ome vollies into her &s;tern. The Duke came up again, and fired &s;everal guns, and both fell a-&s;tern the chace, keeping under &s;ail, and &s;tanding to the we&s;tward. We knotted &s;ome of our rigging, and &s;topt our leaks made with twelve pounders. Our main-ma&s;t was di&s;abled al&s;o, the &s;ails and
<PB N="60" REF="63">
rigging much &s;hattered; but the enemy, aiming to di&s;able my ma&s;ts, I had the good fortune to have only my &s;econd mate, and &s;ome others, blown up with powder. The &s;hip was once &s;et on fire by the enemy's &s;tink-pots, but we &s;oon put it out. About eleven I wore the &s;hip, and de&s;igned to have attacked the enemy again; but, &s;eeing the Duke and Dutche&s;s lying by, the one with a waift in his en&s;ign, and the other with a Spani&s;h jack, the &s;ignals to &s;peak with one another, I brought to. Captain Courtney came on board of me, and we both went on board the Duke; where we con&s;idered the condition the three &s;hips were in, their ma&s;ts and rigging being much damaged in a place where we could get no recruit; that if we en|gaged her again we could propo&s;e to do no more than what we had already done, which was evident did her no great hurt, becau&s;e we could perceive few of our &s;hot entered her &s;ides to any purpo&s;e, and our &s;mall arms availed le&s;s, there being not a man to be &s;een above board; that the lea&s;t thing in the world would bring the Duke's main-ma&s;t, and likewi&s;e the Dutch|e&s;s's forema&s;t, by the board, either of which by its fall might carry away another ma&s;t, and lay us a perfect butt for the enemy, having nothing to command our &s;hips with; &s;o that by his heavy guns he might either &s;ink or take us; that, if we went to board him, we &s;hould run a great hazard in lo&s;ing a great many men with little hope of &s;ucce&s;s, they having above treble the number on board to oppo&s;e us, and there
<PB N="61" REF="64">
being now, in all our three &s;hips, not above 120 men fit for boarding, and tho&s;e but weak, having been very &s;hort of provi&s;ions; &s;o that, if we had boarded her, and been forced off, or left any of our men behind, the enemy by that means would have known our &s;trength, and then gone into the harbour, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prize in &s;pite of all we could do to pre|vent it. Be&s;ides our ammunition was very &s;hort, having only enough to engage a few gla&s;&s;es longer. All this being &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, and knowing the difficulty we &s;hould have to get ma&s;ts, and the time and provi&s;ions we mu&s;t &s;pend before we could get them fitted, we re|&s;olved to forbear attempting her farther, &s;ince our battering her &s;ignified little, and we had not &s;trength enough to board her; therefore, we a|greed to keep her company till night, and then to lo&s;e her, and make the be&s;t of our way into the harbour to &s;ecure the prize we had already taken. We engaged fir&s;t and la&s;t about &s;even hours, during all which time they had on board the Duke but eleven men wounded, among whom was the Captain for the &s;econd time, who had part of his heel-bone &s;truck out with a &s;plinter, and all under his ancle cut above half through with the &s;ame; on board the Dutche&s;s, they had eleven killed, and more than that number wounded; and on board us only two men &s;corched with gun-powder. The enemy's was a brave, lofty, new &s;hip, named the Vir|ginia, and this the fir&s;t voyage &s;he had made. Her burden was 900 tons, and her complement
<PB N="62" REF="65">
of men 450, be&s;ides pa&s;&s;engers, 150 of whom were European pirates, who, having now got all their wealth on board, were re&s;olved to defend it to the la&s;t. The gunner, who had a po&s;t at Manilla, was an expert man, and had provided for her defence with great &s;kill. He had filled up all the &s;pace between the guns with bales to &s;ecure the men. We &s;hattered her &s;ails and rig|ging very much, &s;hot away her mizzen-yard, and killed two of her men out of her tops, which was all the damage we could &s;ee done, though we could not place le&s;s than 500 &s;hot in her hull. Thus ended our attempt.</P>
<P>The&s;e large &s;hips are built at Manilla, of ex|cellent timber that will not &s;plinter; and their &s;ides are thicker and &s;tronger than tho&s;e of &s;hips of the &s;ame burden con&s;tructed in Europe. Had we been together at fir&s;t, and boarded her, we might, perhaps, have taken her; but, after her netting and clo&s;e quarters were fixed, &s;he valued us but little. We might, indeed, have burnt her, at the expence of one of our &s;hips; but that was objected to, not only from a principle of huma|nity, but becau&s;e we had goods of great value on board all our &s;hips.</P>
<P>The enemy had heard at Manilla, that there were two &s;hips fitted out at Bri&s;tol to crui&s;e in the South Seas, and that Captain Dampier was to be their pilot; they had, therefore, provided for their own defence accordingly. However, to do them ju&s;tice, they fought gallantly; and, had the two &s;hips been together, it is more than pro|bable, that neither of them had been taken;
<PB N="63" REF="66">
but as it happened, had not our unrea&s;onable &s;quabbles prevented our &s;ailing out together, the chance would have rather been in our fa|vour: yet this mi&s;carriage, in&s;tead of leading to a reconciliation, &s;erved only as a foundation for new di&s;putes.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of Jan. 1710, we returned again into port, and determined to ha&s;ten home with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. The fir&s;t thing of con&s;e|quence was to di&s;charge our pri&s;oners, and to provide for their voyage to Acapulco; and this being di&s;patched, we applied to the &s;ettling of our own affairs. We &s;pent our time till the 7th in repairing the damage our &s;hips had received from the enemy, in taking in wood and water for our voyage to the Ea&s;t Indies, and in taking an account of the goods and &s;tores on board the prize: and it was no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to find as much bread on board the prize as with our own &s;tock would &s;erve us, at &s;hort allowance, during our long run to Guam.</P>
<P>About this time a warm conte&s;t aro&s;e about appointing a Commander of the Manilla &s;hip, which was looked upon as a tru&s;t of no &s;mall con&s;equence. Captain Dover, being an owner, de&s;ired he might command in chief on board her. Captain Rogers and &s;everal officers of the council contended, that, as Captain Dover was wholly unacquainted with the navigating part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, the command &s;hould be given to Captain Fry, or my&s;elf; but, as I had already the command of the Marquis, I declined any
<PB N="64" REF="67">
farther charge, and voted for Captain Dover; at the &s;ame time recommending Captain Fry and Captain Stretton to act under him; again&s;t which Captain Rogers and his officers entered their prote&s;t. However, on the 9th of January, at a full council, it was carried again&s;t them, and voted by a great majority, that the Captains Fry and Stretton &s;hould both act in equal po&s;t in the &s;ole navigating the Batchelor Frigate (for that was the name now given to the Manilla prize), and in fighting her, if occa&s;ion &s;hould require, under Captain Dover, who at the &s;ame time was re&s;trained from interrupting them in their bu&s;ine&s;s, but charged to be careful of what was in the &s;hip, and to &s;ee that nothing was acted on board contrary to the intere&s;t of the owners and captors. The matter being thus qualified, the nominal command given to Cap|tain Dover, and the executive power ve&s;ted in the naval officers, Captain Rogers withdrew his pro|te&s;t, and the council proceeded to the choice of the inferior officers, appointing Alexander Sel|kirk ma&s;ter, and Jo&s;eph Smith, chief mate: they al&s;o agreed to furni&s;h her complement of men, by &s;electing 30 from the Duke, 25 from the Dutche&s;s, and 13 from the Marquis, which, with 36 La&s;cars taken on board her, formed a tolerable crew of more than 100 mariners. This bu&s;ine&s;s being thus fully &s;ettled, and the i&s;land of Guam pitched upon as the place of rendez|vous in ca&s;e of &s;eparation, on the 10th of Janu|ary we weighed anchor, and ran out at midnight.
<PB N="65" REF="68">
At 12 the next day Cape St. Lucas bore north, di&s;tant about five leagues. We &s;teered away for &s;ome days S. W. by S. till we got into the trade-winds, and then our cour&s;e was uniform.</P>
<P>All the natives of California that we &s;aw dur|ing our &s;tay at Puerto Seguro did not amount to 300. They had large limbs, were very &s;traight and tall, and of a much darker complexion than any other people that we had met with in the South Seas. Their hair was long, lank, and black, and hung down upon their hips. The men were all &s;tark-naked; but the women had a covering about their wai&s;ts made of the &s;ilk-gra&s;s already mentioned, fringed and knotted. All of them that we &s;aw were old, and mi&s;erably wrinkled; perhaps they concealed from us their maidens, for rea&s;ons that need not be explained. The language of the natives was guttural, very har&s;h, and unplea&s;ant. They &s;eemed to covet nothing that we had, except axes, &s;aws, and knives; and even the&s;e they did not attempt to &s;teal. Their huts were low, and wholly made up of branches of trees; and &s;eemed rather a kind of temporary coverings than &s;ettled dwel|lings. While we lay in port they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted chiefly on fi&s;h; and though they neither made u&s;e of nets or lines, yet they had a method of &s;triking them with lances that was very dexte|rous, and at which they were very expert. They were be&s;ides mo&s;t excellent divers, and in&s;tead of canoes made u&s;e of rafts. They were very civil and inoffen&s;ive; and were ob&s;erved to pay
<PB N="66" REF="69">
great re&s;pect to one among them, who&s;e head was adorned with feathers very artificially com|bined, and who probably was their wizard, or cunning man. Some of them had &s;trings of pearls, and party-coloured &s;hells &s;o prettily in|termixed, that, though we had gla&s;s-beads, and other &s;howy trinkets, yet they paid no &s;ort of attention to any of them; but prized their own ornaments above every thing but cutting in&s;tru|ments. Their arms are bows and arrows, in the u&s;e of which their boys were &s;o expert as to &s;hoot birds flying by way of amu&s;ement. They grew very familiar with us while we &s;taid, and came frequently to gaze at the men as they cut wood and filled water, but never offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t in any thing like labour. They get fire like other Indians, by rubbing two &s;ticks together, which kindle almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly.</P>
<P>From this harbour we departed but very &s;len|derly provided, having but little live-&s;tock, and hardly any liquors but what were found in the prize. As &s;oon as we were out of &s;ight of land, we were all put to &s;hort allowance, officers and men: to the latter four-and-twenty ounces of flour, four pounds of meat, and two gallons of water, to a me&s;s of five men in 24 hours. But in a few days, the Batchelor made a &s;ignal to give us &s;ome bread, they having found a large quantity concealed, with &s;ome &s;weet-meats. We had 500 weight for our &s;hare, the Duke 1000 weight, and the Dutche&s;s as much; in return for which we &s;ent back to the prize &s;ome ca&s;ks
<PB N="67" REF="70">
of flour, and a barrel of Engli&s;h beef; and the like pre&s;ent was returned from the other &s;hips. From this time till the 10th of March nothing remarkable happened.</P>
<P>On that day we made the i&s;land Saraua, one of the Ladrones, and the &s;ame evening came in &s;ight of Guam, di&s;tant about three leagues. Next day we came to anchor in the port of Umatta, at about a mile di&s;tance from the hou&s;es, in lat. 13 deg. 30 min. N. by e&s;tima|tion; long from Cape St. Lucas, 100 deg. 19 min. W. We went in with French and Spani&s;h colours, that they might not &s;u&s;pect us to be enemies. Several of their boats came about our &s;hips; but none would venture on board, till being off the anchoring-place, one was &s;ent by the Spani&s;h Governor, de&s;iring to know who we were, and what we wanted. We pre&s;ently di&s;patched our interpreter with a letter, purport|ing, that we were &s;ubjects of Great Britain, and driven by nece&s;&s;ity to &s;top at tho&s;e i&s;lands to purcha&s;e provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries; that, if our wants were &s;upplied with civility, we &s;hould pay generou&s;ly; but, on the contrary, if our re|que&s;t was denied, we &s;hould proceed to act ac|cording to the laws of war. To this letter we received a very obliging an&s;wer from the Spa|ni&s;h Governor. Don Juan Antonio Pimental, and were furni&s;hed with hogs, oxen, rice, maize, poultry, and other nece&s;&s;aries in a more plentiful manner, and at a cheaper rate, than we could ex|pect. We continued at Guam till the 21&s;t of
<PB N="68" REF="71">
March, during which time reciprocal civilities daily pa&s;&s;ed between the officers on board and the gentlemen of the i&s;land; and we parted per|fectly &s;atisfied with each other's behaviour. We found the variation in the&s;e parts only half a point to the ea&s;tward, though in our run acro&s;s the Great South Sea, we had it 12 degrees: the rea&s;on I take to be, the unevenne&s;s of the globe, and its unequal mixture of much matter differ|ing in it&s;elf as to the magnetical quality; as hav|ing large and &s;toney mountains, &s;pacious vallies, deep &s;eas, long continued continents, with migh|ty &s;cattered rocks of load-&s;tone, iron mines, and other magnetical &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>The natives of Guam are of a dark com|plexion, but not &s;o black as the Indians of Cali|fornia. They are in general the large&s;t and be&s;t limbed men I ever &s;aw, and &s;ome of them hairy, and very &s;trong. The women are &s;traight and tall, and in the neighbourhood of the Spaniards go decently cloathed; but in the remote parts of the i&s;land they go quite naked. They are &s;aid to be man-eaters, and to have no &s;ettled way of wor&s;hip, but every one pays a kind of adoration to they know not what. The i&s;land is plentifully &s;upplied with cattle, and might be made the gar|den of the world, if the Spaniards were not as idle as the Indians; but as nature &s;pontaneou&s;ly produces &s;ufficient for &s;u&s;tenance, they avail them&s;elves but little of cultivation. Of all the works of art for which the Indians are re|markable, the paroas, or boats, of this i&s;land
<PB N="69" REF="72">
are certainly the mo&s;t wonderful, as they ex|ceed in &s;wift &s;ailing every other ve&s;&s;el yet &s;een throughout the world. We were a&s;&s;ured upon the be&s;t authority, that they will &s;ail 20 leagues an hour; and the Captain of the Spani&s;h guard &s;aid, he would lo&s;e his head if they did not per|form it.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, March 21, 1710, we were un|der &s;ail, and &s;teered away W. by S. with mode|rate gales from the N. N. E. which continued &s;o for &s;ome weeks; but about the middle of April the blowing weather came on, and conti|nued till the 27th of that month, during which time mo&s;t of our main-&s;hrouds, &s;everal of our &s;tays, mo&s;t of our running-ropes, and the miz|zen gears, gave way, &s;o that the yard came by the board, and by its fall wounded the fir&s;t Lieutenant, &s;o that we feared he never would have recovered. Mo&s;t of our &s;ails too were &s;plit; but, being &s;upplied with new &s;hrouds by Captain Rogers, and with other ropes by Cap|tain Courtney, I bent new &s;ails; but found the &s;hip very leaky. The Duke and Dutche&s;s too &s;uffered much by the tempe&s;tuous weather, and the Batchelor &s;plit her &s;ails; but being other|wi&s;e &s;toutly built and rigged, nothing but run|ning again&s;t a rock could hurt her. I had no conception of meeting with &s;uch boi&s;terous wea|ther &s;o near the Line, which proved as bad as that we encountered in &s;urrounding Cape Horn, with this difference only, that the one was in|ten&s;ely cold, and the other intolerably hot. And
<PB N="70" REF="73">
being now cro&s;&s;ed by variable winds, &s;ometimes lying by, &s;ometimes &s;cudding before the wind, and unable to pur&s;ue our direct cour&s;e, our pro|vi&s;ions began to fail, and on board of us rats ro&s;e to a very high price. The &s;hips were be|&s;ides leaky, and our men began to &s;icken with exce&s;&s;ive labour and hard living. A general council was therefore called to con&s;ider what was be&s;t to be done in our pre&s;ent condition, when it was agreed to make the i&s;land of Talao, that of Ternate, or, if neither of them could be reached, then to put into &s;ome part of Min|danao.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, May the 2d, we ob&s;erved a ring about the &s;un, and were apprehen&s;ive of more bad weather. In the night we pa&s;&s;ed by Talao without &s;eeing it; and Captain Dampier, who had been twice in the&s;e &s;eas before, gave out, that, if we could not reach Ternate, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for us to get refre&s;hment on the coa&s;t of New Guinea, which proved true; yet it was with the greate&s;t difficulty the men could be prevailed upon to &s;ubmit to &s;hort allowance.</P>
<P>Monday the 8th, having had tempe&s;tuous weather, we perceived that a &s;trong current had &s;et in to the ea&s;tward; and to our a&s;toni&s;hment we found the land in &s;ight to be Cape Noba, a promontory at the ea&s;t end of Gilolo, bearing S. S. E. di&s;tant 15 leagues. Perceiving now that we could not get to the i&s;land of Ternate, nor to that of Mindanao, we re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of our way through the &s;traits of Gi|lolo:
<PB N="71" REF="74">
but, notwith&s;tanding our utmo&s;t efforts, we continued &s;ailing among a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, mo&s;t of them uninhabited, but all capable of producing &s;pices, during the whole month of May, without being able to avail our&s;elves of any of their refre&s;hments, On the 20th of May we came in &s;ight of the i&s;land of Ceram, as we then thought, but afterwards found it to be the i&s;land of Bouro.</P>
<P>On the 25th, we came in &s;ight of a low i&s;land right-a head of us, and about noon ob|&s;erved an opening, which, when we came near, we found to be a pa&s;&s;age between two little i&s;lands that almo&s;t joined. They were very full of green trees, and by the &s;ea-&s;ide we beheld many groves of cocoa-nut, plantain, and other fruit-trees, that exhibited a very plea&s;ant ap|pearance.</P>
<P>In a capacious bay we likewi&s;e took notice of a little town, and &s;aw &s;everal inhabitants pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing along the &s;hore. We &s;ent in our boats for provi&s;ions and pilots, and the Duke and my&s;elf turned up towards the village, but on &s;ounding found no ground. The natives in|formed us, there was a bank oppo&s;ite a cer|tain land-mark, on which we might anchor. A|bundance of people came off with Indian wheat, cocoa nuts, yams, potatoes, papas, poultry, and &s;everal beautiful birds, which they exchanged for knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and other toys, being very civil, and to all appearance hone&s;t. They are Mahometans, of a middle &s;tature, and tawney;
<PB N="72" REF="75">
but the women are fairer than the men, having very long, lank, black hair; their mouths, lips, and no&s;es remarkably &s;mall. The women were decently covered; but the men in general were naked. The&s;e i&s;lands were named Camhava and Wan&s;hut; but, not an&s;wering our purpo&s;e, we agreed to &s;teer for Bonton, where we arrived on Monday the 29th of May; and, the &s;ame day, Captain Dampier, Mr. Connely, and Mr. Van|brugh, went with a pre&s;ent to the King of Bon|ton, at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting him to &s;upply us with provi&s;ions, and to &s;end us a pilot to carry us to Batavia.</P>
<P>On the 30th, a paroa came from the King with one of his nobles on board, and a pilot to carry us into harbour. He put on an air of im|portance, and a&s;ked, How we dared to come to an anchor there, without leave from the Great King of Bonton? However, he brought each Commander a piece of his country-cloth, a bottle of arrack, &s;ome rice in ba&s;kets, as a pre&s;ent from the King; as al&s;o a letter from the officers we had &s;ent on &s;hore, giving an account, that they had been well received, and that the town where the King re&s;ides was large, walled, fortified, and defended after the European manner with a number of heavy cannon. Another pre&s;ent was returned, and five guns fired by every &s;hip at the me&s;&s;enger's going off; at which he &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed. Our people trafficked with the natives for poultry, maize, pompions, pa|pas, lemons, Guinea-corn, &amp;c. and gave them in
<PB N="73" REF="76">
exchange knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, old cloaths, and old nails. The people were civil; but our officers making a longer &s;tay than they intended, we began to &s;u&s;pect that the Moors had detained them; for they are very treacherous. However, we heard from them every day; and at length the Dutche&s;s's pinnace came down with Lieu|tenant Connely, who told us, they had purcha&s;|ed four la&s;t of rice, which co&s;t 600 dollars; and that Mr. Vanbrugh was detained for the payment of the money. The next morning it came, and was equally di&s;tributed among the four &s;hips, &s;ome great men coming to deliver it, and re|ceive the money.&mdash;The town of Bonton is very populous, and by it runs a fine river, but is barred &s;o that &s;hips of burden cannot approach it. About 50 i&s;lands are tributary to this king, who gives audience in a chair of &s;tate covered with &s;carlet-cloth, and is always attended by a guard of nine men, armed, after the European manner, with mu&s;quets and &s;cymitars. He has, be&s;ides, four or five &s;laves, who &s;it at his feet, and are ready whenever he commands to do the mo&s;t &s;ervile offices. The petty princes and great men &s;it on his left hand, and the &s;trangers &s;tand before him.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, June the 7th, all the provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries which this town could &s;upply being brought on board, and the officers who went to wait upon the King, returned, the &s;ignal was given to weigh, and at four in the afternoon we &s;et &s;ail without a pilot, there being none to be

had on this i&s;land. Captain Dampier pretended to be acquainted with the pa&s;&s;age, and mentions the &s;ame in his book, but now he remembered nothing of it but the &s;tory.</P>
<P>On Friday the 9th, we came in &s;ight of Solayo, lying clo&s;e to the i&s;land of Celebes, and in|habited by Malayans, who are tributaries to the Dutch. Between the &s;outh-end of Celebes and the i&s;land of Solayo, are three &s;mall low i&s;lands, and the be&s;t pa&s;&s;age is between that which lies next to Solayo, and a little one lying to the northward of it. It is very dangerous going to the &s;outh|ward of Solayo, the Dutch never daring to at|tempt it.</P>
<P>On the 10th we made prize of a country pa|roa, and brought the Ma&s;ter on board the Dutche&s;s. He was a Malayan belonging to Ma|ca&s;&s;ar, bound thither, came la&s;t from Bonton, and undertook to pilot us to Batavia for a good reward, provided we would promi&s;e to keep the matter a &s;ecret from the Dutch, to both which conditions we very readily agreed; and the man performed what he undertook with great &s;kill and fidelity. We pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;traits of Salango, having always from five to &s;even fa|thom water in our pa&s;&s;age; then &s;teering to the we&s;tward, our pilot's boat attended us till we were through the la&s;t &s;trait, and then bore away towards Maca&s;&s;ar.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 20th of June, 1720, accord|ing to our reckoning, we came to an anchor in Batavia road; but with the Dutch it was Wed|ne&s;day,
<PB N="75" REF="78">
June 21; for we had lo&s;t 18 hours in going round to the we&s;tward, and they had gained &s;ix in &s;ailing to the ea&s;tward, which made a whole day difference between our account and theirs. The rea&s;on is, that a &s;hip &s;ailing to the we&s;tward, and &s;o following the cour&s;e of the &s;un, makes every day &s;omething longer than in any fixed &s;tation it would be. Thus in every 15 degrees &s;he removes to the we&s;tward from the meridian from whence &s;he fir&s;t &s;et out, &s;he gains an hour; in 90 degrees, &s;ix hours; and in 360, which compo&s;e the whole circumference of the globe, &s;he will find a whole day &s;hort in her reckoning, according to the account of the place &s;he arrives at. The contrary happens to the &s;hip that &s;ails ea&s;tward; for, as &s;he advances a|gain&s;t the cour&s;e of the &s;un, &s;he lo&s;es &s;o much of every day, which is thereby &s;hortened, and becomes le&s;s than 24 hours, by con&s;equence lo&s;|ing an hour in every 15 degrees, and con&s;equent|ly will be a day before the account of the place &s;he arrives at. By this it appears, that the &s;hip which &s;ails round the world we&s;tward, lo&s;es a whole day, and that which performs the &s;ame voyage ea&s;tward gains a day. So we having made the greater part of the circumference, and the Dutch at Batavia the other part the contrary way, our lo&s;s and their gain made up the twenty-four hours; and thus we came to differ a day.</P>
<P>When we came to an anchor, the Dutche&s;s fired thirteen guns to &s;alute the Dutch flag; but
<PB N="76" REF="79">
it being night, the Commandant did not then an|&s;wer; but in the morning &s;ent his boat to make an apology, and then fired gun for gun with every &s;hip. Soon after this friendly &s;alute taken on both &s;ides, the Commanders went on &s;hore; and, after waiting upon the Shebander, were introduced to the Governor, who received us with civility, examined our commi&s;&s;ion, and en|quired much concerning the &s;ucce&s;s of our voyage; but, not being King's &s;hips, would not permit us to heave down in the States dock at Orere&s;t, but gave us leave to careen at the i&s;land of Hern, which is at no great di&s;tance from the other, and allowed us &s;ome Malayan caulkers to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;topping our leaks.</P>
<P>As the Marquis was in the wor&s;t condition, &s;he was ordered to be laid down fir&s;t; but upon examination &s;he was judged unfit to proceed upon the voyage; and therefore was unladen and put up to &s;ale. We then hove down the Duke and Dutche&s;s, and found their &s;heathing much worm-eaten; but otherwi&s;e not much da|maged: the Batchelor wanted no repairs but in her rigging. The weather was extremely hot during our &s;tay at this city: many of our men and officers fell &s;ick; and I was among the num|ber. The ma&s;ter of the Duke, the gunner of the Dutche&s;s, and &s;everal of the common men, fell a &s;acrifice to this unfriendly climate. One Read, a young man belonging to the Dutche&s;s, venturing to &s;wim, had both his legs &s;napt off by a &s;hark, which at the &s;econd bite, before we
<PB N="77" REF="80">
could get him on board, cut him in two in the middle, and put an end to his mi&s;ery. During our &s;tay, though we had the run of the markets, we found it very difficult to procure &s;alt provi|&s;ions, to lay in a &s;tock to &s;erve us till we &s;hould arrive at the Cape of Good Hope, and therefore were obliged to purcha&s;e live cattle, and to kill and pickle them our&s;elves. All manner of traf|fic, except for provi&s;ions, was prohibited with the natives or inhabitants of the city, upon the &s;evere&s;t penalties, to avoid every occa&s;ion of di&s;pute with the Ea&s;t-India Companies of both nations: and, having &s;ettled all our affairs in a very amicable manner, new rigged our &s;hips, and di&s;po&s;ed of the men belonging to the Mar|quis among the other &s;hips, we began on the 15th of September to prepare for &s;ailing, when I was appointed &s;econd Captain in the Dutche&s;s, and Mr. Ballot, ma&s;ter; Capt. Pope, fir&s;t Lieutenant of the Duke, and Mr. Selkirk, ma&s;ter; Capt. Dampier, &s;econd Captain in the Batchelor, and Mr. Knolman, ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>On the 20th we repaired on board; but be|fore we were ready to &s;ail, it was the 14th of October; when, about &s;ix in the morning, we weighed anchor; but in the afternoon the &s;ea-breeze took us, and we were forced to return.</P>
<P>On the 19th we made &s;ail with a fre&s;h breeze, and at two in the afternoon came to an anchor off Java-head, when two Engli&s;h gentlemen came off to us, to demand the relea&s;e of a man who had concealed him&s;elf, unknown to the
<PB N="78" REF="81">
officers, on board the Batchelor, and who was given up without oppo&s;ition. In the mean time, while the gentlemen were in conver&s;ation with the officers, a party from the &s;hip went off with their boat to buy fowls, for which they gave in exchange knives, toys, and other trifles, which the natives value more than money.</P>
<P>On the 23d the gentlemen took their leave; and the party who went off to truck for fowls having reported that there were buffaloes in abundance to be had for &s;hooting, another party were &s;ent off to bring &s;ome on board; but they returned without &s;ucce&s;s. They came in &s;ight of whole herds, but &s;o exceeding wild, that the moment they &s;aw the appearance of a man, they all took the alarm, and fled to the woods with &s;o much &s;wiftne&s;s, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to come within mu&s;ket-&s;hot of them. One of the party, who had ventured to follow them into the woods, was &s;urprized by a tyger, who was within le&s;s than a hundred yards of him before he thought proper to make his retreat; and was pur&s;ued by the creature &s;o clo&s;e, that, had he not reached the water, he mu&s;t have been devoured. His companions fired more than twenty &s;hot at the tyger before he went off, which he did at la&s;t, though &s;orely wounded.</P>
<P>We &s;taid here till the 26th, when we made &s;ail, and about noon Java-head bore E. by N. di&s;tant about &s;even leagues. From hence to the Cape of Good Hope we met with nothing re|markable; and, on the 30th of December, came
<PB N="79" REF="82">
to an anchor in Table-bay, in &s;even fathom wa|ter. We &s;aluted the fort with nine guns; and they returned &s;even. As &s;oon as the &s;hips were moored, the Captains and principal officers went a&s;hore to pay their compliments to the Gover|nor, by whom they were honourably received. The place and people have been &s;o often de|&s;cribed already, that we &s;hall not di&s;gu&s;t the reader with u&s;ele&s;s repetitions.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay here, we employed the time in victualling, watering, and refitting our &s;hips, for the remaining part of our voyage home. The Duke, commanded by Captain Rogers, had been leaky ever &s;ince her departure from Cali|fornia; and, notwith&s;tanding all that could be done both at Batavia and this place, it could not be &s;topped; but what was remarkable, in a few days after we left the Cape, it &s;topt of it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here we had an opportunity of writing to our owners, by means of an Ea&s;t-India &s;hip ju&s;t rea|dy to &s;ail when we arrived. In the letter we ac|quainted them with our having made prize of a &s;mall Manilla &s;hip, and of our having her in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and al&s;o, that we intended to take the advantage of returning home in company with the Dutch Ea&s;t-India fleet, who were hourly expected, which would occa&s;ion us to tarry till the latter end of March, when it was imagined they would be ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P>On February the 22d, the Dutch fleet arrived, being in all 12 &s;ail. We &s;aluted the Admiral at
<PB N="80" REF="83">
his coming with &s;even guns, as did likewi&s;e the fort. There were at this time in the harbour 17 Dutch &s;hips, and &s;ix Engli&s;h. The town was crowded, and many of our men were ill. Mr. Vanbrugh, the owners chief agent, died, as did Mr. Appleby, mate of the Duke, and &s;eve|ral others. We began to be impatient; and found it nece&s;&s;ary to begin to furni&s;h our&s;elves with provi&s;ions as early as po&s;&s;ible, as every thing began to increa&s;e in price as the town began to fill. The Batavia fleet was &s;oon followed by four &s;hips from Ceylon. Six came from that i&s;land; but near Madaga&s;car met with &s;uch a violent &s;torm, that &s;ome were forced to cut away their main-ma&s;ts, and throw over &s;ome of their lee-guns, having much water at the &s;ame time in their holds. The four came into the Cape much damaged, and believed the other two had foundered at &s;ea. Several Engli&s;h Indiamen ar|rived al&s;o in the road; as al&s;o a Portugue&s;e &s;hip from Rio de Janeiro on the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il, bound for Mezambique, to take in &s;laves.</P>
<P>At length, on April the 6th, all the homeward bound &s;hips being ready to &s;ail, we weighed in the morning, and &s;ailed with a &s;mall breeze of wind at E.S.E. and by noon came to an anchor at Penguin i&s;land, the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land bear|ing &s;outh-we&s;terly. At three we &s;ailed again, being in all 25 &s;ail of Engli&s;h and Dutch, all good &s;hips, under the command of Admiral Peter de Vos. At &s;ix the Cape of Good Hope bore S. by W. half W. di&s;tant about &s;even
<PB N="81" REF="84">
leagues; and thus, having taken our depar|ture, we proceeded on our voyage April the 23d, which being Sr. George's-day, and the an|niver&s;ary of her Maje&s;ty of Great Britain, the Duke and Dutche&s;s &s;aluted each other with drums, trumpets, and other formalities, in ho|nour of the day; and in the evening the re&s;pec|tive Captains gave an entertainment, of which all the officers on board partook.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 3, 1711, we made the i&s;land of St. Helena, in lat. 16 deg. S. It lies 1000 miles at lea&s;t from any land, and is not more than 10 leagues in length, and about eight in breadth, &s;urrounded with rocks, and elevated above the &s;ea by towering mountains, that look at a di&s;|tance like lofty buildings ri&s;ing to the clouds. The&s;e mountains are covered with whole&s;ome herbs and plants; and the vallies are &s;o fruitful, that they yield an increa&s;e of whatever is &s;own in them an hundred-fold. The Portugue&s;e fir&s;t di&s;covered this little &s;pot accidentally, as they were ranging along the coa&s;t of Africa, in order to find their way to the Ea&s;t-Indies. It was then uninhabited; and, according to their cu&s;tom, they &s;et &s;ome live goats and &s;wine on &s;hore, which multiplied to that degree, that ever &s;ince there have been enough to &s;upply the &s;hips that touch at that i&s;land with &s;ea&s;onable refre&s;hment. The Dutch fir&s;t inhabited, and afterwards aban|doned it, and removed their &s;ettlement to the Cape of Hood Hope. The Engli&s;h then took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; when the Dutch, who did not
<PB N="82" REF="85">
think it worth keeping before, returned, fell upon the Engli&s;h, and drove them out. The Dutch in their turn were expelled by the Eng|li&s;h, who have now been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, have erected a very &s;trong fort for their &s;ecurity, and built a town near the little bay, where &s;hips generally anchor in their way to and from the Ea&s;t Indies. It is of infinite u&s;e in relieving the &s;ailors from that dreadful di&s;temper the &s;ea|&s;curvy; for, as it naturally produces lemons, oranges, and other fruits, and as greens and roots are planted in abundance, tho&s;e who are langui&s;hing under the la&s;t &s;tage of the &s;curvy are frequently recovered by the u&s;e of tho&s;e re|fre&s;hments without any other phy&s;ic. It would be delightful living in this i&s;land, were it larger, or more frequented; but the confinement in &s;o &s;mall a place in the middle of a va&s;t ocean &s;o remote from all communication with the re&s;t of the world, renders the re&s;idence there &s;o lonely, that it has rather the appearance of living in exile than in a land of freedom. And indeed, what makes it &s;till more uncomfortable, our own &s;hips find &s;o much better entertainment at the Cape than can be expected in this little &s;pot, that many of them &s;tore them&s;elves there &s;o plentifully, and recover their &s;ick men &s;o effec|tually, as not to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of touch|ing at St. Helena, whereby not only the re&s;i|dence of the inhabitants is rendered more dull, but their means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is very much re|&s;trained; for as they have nothing to depend
<PB N="83" REF="86">
upon but their traffic with the &s;hips that call to refre&s;h, every one that pa&s;&s;es by without touch|ing is a diminution of their profits: &s;o that in fact the people have little or no encouragement to continue there, and many of them make heavy complaints. Indeed, the &s;urrounding &s;ea, that abounding in fi&s;h is a con&s;iderable help, and the fertility of the &s;oil, which is &s;ure to re|ward the pains of the cultivator, exempt them from famine; but for cloaths and all other con|veniences, their dependance is upon &s;trangers.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of May we took our departure from this i&s;land, and on the 7th made the i&s;land of A&s;cen&s;ion, which is &s;till uninhabited. As the &s;prings, which were di&s;covered by Dampier, lie remote from the &s;hore, very few &s;hips attempt to water, or indeed &s;top at A&s;cen&s;ion; &s;ome indeed, who are in want of fre&s;h provi&s;ions, fi&s;h here for turtle, of which there are great plenty all round the coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened in the cour&s;e of our voyage till May the 27th, when two of our Dutch &s;ailors died, and were decently buri|ed according to the cu&s;tom of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>About this time all the flag-&s;hips &s;truck their flags, the Admiral hoi&s;ted a broad pendant, and all the other &s;hips did the &s;ame. This was done with a view to deceive the enemy, that in ca&s;e any crui&s;ers &s;hould come in &s;ight, they might take us for a &s;quadron of Dutch men of-war.</P>
<P>On the 12th, a mutiny happened among our men; and two Dutchmen who were the ring-leaders
<PB N="84" REF="87">
were whipped and put in irons. For &s;ome days we had but little wind, being in the calm latitude, which we reckon from 22 deg. to 28 deg. N.</P>
<P>June the 13th, the Dutch Admiral made the &s;ignal tor each &s;hip to keep the Line, and we blacked our &s;hip to make her look the more like a Dutchman.</P>
<P>On the 15th, in the morning, the Admiral made the &s;ignal for all the Engli&s;h Commanders, and &s;ome of the Dutch &s;kippers, to come on board him, where we were &s;umptuou&s;ly entertain|ed at Dinner, and the frank humour of the Dutch|men made the company jolly before we parted.</P>
<P>June 23, a Dutch &s;hip being in di&s;tre&s;s fired &s;everal guns; upon which the whole fleet &s;hor|tened &s;ail. Her damage being &s;oon repaired, the &s;ignal was given to continue our cour&s;e, and we took the Batchelor in tow, being a heavy &s;ailor, and forced to croud the canva&s;s to keep company; but, it blowing hard the next day, we were forced to ca&s;t her off.</P>
<P>On the 26th, the Batchelor's pinnace had her back broke, by the &s;hip's running over her; but the men that were in her were all miraculou&s;ly &s;aved, by means of the haw&s;er which they were carrying from our &s;hip to take her in tow&punc; In the evening the King William Indiaman took her in tow, and next morning ca&s;t her off.</P>
<P>On the 28th, being got into the latitude o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> 51 deg. N. we had thick foggy weather, with
<PB N="85" REF="88">
the wind at &s;outh, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;everal days, and all the white the Adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ept firing two guns every hour, and each &s;hip in the fleet an|&s;wered with one. This was done to keep the fleet together, and it an&s;wered the purpo&s;e very well; for when the fog di&s;per&s;ed, and the wea|ther came clear, there was not one &s;hip mi&s;&s;ing. The Dutch convoy, however, took care after|wards to be well paid for his wa&s;te of powder.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened till the 12th of July, when the Donnegall Indiaman lo&s;t her fore-top ma&s;t, and made the &s;ignal for the fleet to &s;horten &s;ail. Being now in near 60 deg. N. la|titude, we had no might, but cold drizzling wea|ther; yet nothing to compare to the cold in the &s;ame latitude in going round Cape Horn &s;outh|ward; for there the cold was &s;o inten&s;e that many of our men &s;ickened; and yet we were here and at Cape Horn much about the &s;ame time of the year, allowing for the difference of the two climates.</P>
<P>On the 14th, we came in &s;ight of Bera, and &s;poke with a Dani&s;h &s;hip bound to Dublin, who told us the war &s;till continued, and that he had &s;poke a day or two before with a Dutch &s;qua|dron of 10 men of war, and three victuallers, lying off Shetland to wait for us; &s;o that by keeping between that and Fair I&s;land, we could not po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;s &s;eeing them. Next day we came in &s;ight of them, when all the fleet &s;a|luted the Commodore, and he made the &s;ignal for all the Commanders to come aboard of him
<PB N="86" REF="89">
for failing orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&punc; The Captains Courtney and Dover went accordingly, and were courteou&s;ly received, and given to under&s;tand, that they might be &s;upplied with whatever provi&s;ions they &s;tood in need of, on paying for the &s;ame, he hav|ing brought victuallers from Holland for that purpo&s;e. We lay off Shetland &s;ome days, and caught ling and cod in abundance, during which time the Shetlanders came off to us, and brought fowls and &s;heep, which we purcha&s;ed at much cheaper rates than of our Dutch victuallers.</P>
<P>We were now very &s;ickly, having been more than three months in our pa&s;&s;age from the Cape to this place; and we were be&s;ides very peevi&s;h and quarrel&s;ome among our&s;elves; now that we came near home, jealou&s;ies aro&s;e about embezzle|ments. The agents had been to the Duke to demand the gold, plate, pearl, and jewels, on board; and they were returned not very well &s;atisfied with their reception. But, while the&s;e di&s;putes were at their height, orders were given to &s;et &s;ail. In the mean time letters were di&s;|patched to London and Am&s;terdam, acquainting the owners with our progre&s;s, and pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion, and de&s;iring their in&s;tructions to regulate our future proceedings. Before we left Shetland we took four hog&s;heads of beer on board from the Dutch Commodore, which &s;erved us till we arrived on the 23d in &s;ight of Holland, in the evening of which day we came to an anchor in the Texel road.</P>
<P>On the 27th, we received a general letter from
<PB N="87" REF="90">
our owners, dated, Bri&s;tol, june 6th, 1711, in which they acquainted us, that the Ea&s;t-India Company were incen&s;ed again&s;t us, and had ap|pointed a &s;ecret committee to in&s;pect their char|ter as to privileges; and that they were re&s;olved to take all advantages, in ca&s;e of the lea&s;t in|fringement on what they pretended to be their ex|clu&s;ive right of trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies. This letter likewi&s;e recommended the greate&s;t caution on our part with regard to the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company; or from that Company as well as from our own, they had rea&s;on to fear all po&s;|&s;ible ob&s;truction. It was therefore mo&s;t &s;trictly enjoined, that neither officer nor &s;ailor &s;hould, on any pretence whatever, be &s;uffered to take any goods on &s;hore; nor were we to allow any &s;tranger to come on board to purcha&s;e the lea&s;t trifle; for that, if any &s;uch thing &s;hould be proved, the whole cargo would be forfeited.</P>
<P>It was a great relief to us, when, on the 5th of Augu&s;t, Mr. Hollidge, one of our principal owners came on board us; for, though we kept the &s;tricte&s;t watch, it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to pre|vent the &s;ailors from running things a&s;hore in the night. On this gentleman's arrival, it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to draw up a &s;hort account of our voyage from the journals of the re&s;pective Commanders, and an affidavit was made to the truth of it. In this memorial we &s;et forth, that we went out as private men-of-war, and not as trading &s;hips; and that no &s;ort of merchandize was &s;hipped on board our &s;hips at any of the
<PB N="88" REF="91">
i&s;lands or ports we touched at in the Ea&s;t Indies, nor any traffic carried on there, other than for nece&s;&s;aries and provi&s;ions for the &s;hips and &s;hips company. To this all the officers and mo&s;t of the &s;eamen voluntarily &s;wore and &s;et their hands. We continued in Holland, without any remark|able event, till the 30th of September, 1711, when we &s;ailed from the Texel, under convoy of her Maje&s;ty's &s;hips, E&s;&s;ex, Canterbury, Med|way, and Dullidge, and anchored in the Downs on the 2d of October. On the 13th, the Duke and Dutche&s;s came up to Eriff, where the Batchelor had been moored &s;ome time before: and here all the &s;hips continued till they were unloaded. The produce of the cargo, and the trea&s;ure brought home in the&s;e &s;hips, were &s;uppo&s;|ed to amount to between 3 and 400,000 l. for, after all charges of convoy, agency, law-&s;uits, embezzlements, of which great complaint was made, and of every kind of thievery practi&s;ed in &s;uch ca&s;es, the nett profits, that were after|wards fairly divided, amounted to 170,000 l.</P>
<P>Among the di&s;a&s;ters that befel the adventurers in this voyage, that of lo&s;ing Mr. Hatley, with his little crew, near the i&s;lands of Gallapagoes, was mo&s;t to be deplored; yet, though his death was &s;uppo&s;ed to be certain, having little or no provi&s;ions on board, and &s;till le&s;s water, after the conclu&s;ion of the war, he returned home, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all who knew him. It then appeared, that, when he parted company with the Duke, having no re&s;ource, he made directly

for the main; and, falling in with Cape Pa&s;&s;ao, his little crew almo&s;t fami&s;hed, and him&s;elf in a mi&s;erable weak condition, he formed the re&s;olu|tion, with the con&s;ent of his people, to &s;urren|der them&s;elves pri&s;oners to the enemy; but, un|fortunately, the enemy to whom they &s;urren|dered were not the civilized Spaniards, but a mixed breed of Indians and Mulattos, who bore an implacable hatred to all white men, from a rooted aver&s;ion to the Spani&s;h tyranny. The&s;e wretches u&s;ed their helple&s;s pri&s;oners barbarou&s;|ly, tied their hands behind them, and la&s;hed them to po&s;ts, where they half-fleed them with whips; and mo&s;t certainly would have tortured them to death, had it not been for the interpo|&s;ition of their prie&s;t, to whom the&s;e half-heathen converts pay great re&s;pect. Being, by the hu|manity of this good Padre, re&s;cued out of the hands of tho&s;e barbarians, and conveyed to a Spani&s;h &s;ettlement, Mr. Hatley was received with kindne&s;s, and u&s;ed with much civility; and, when peace was declared, was &s;et at li|berty, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to return to his country, where he afterwards engaged in a &s;econd expe|dition to the &s;ame &s;eas, and again fell into the hands of the &s;ame enemy.</P>
<P>We have not yet been able to learn the future proceedings of the officers who conducted this enterprize. It is more than probable, that, hav|ing enriched them&s;elves by the voyage, they re|tired and lived private. We find, indeed, a Mr. Cooke engaged in a &s;ucceeding voyage,
<PB N="90" REF="94">
but it does not appear that it was the Captain Cooke of who&s;e voyage we have ju&s;t given an account. Mr. Hatley, indeed, who fell into the hands of the Spaniards, was employed as &s;econd Captain under Shelvock, and of him we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak largely hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>THE VOYAGE OF CAPTAIN CLIPPERTON ROUND THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN John Clipperton (or, as &s;ome write, Clippington) was born at Yarmouth, in the county of Norfolk; and his friends being mo&s;t of them &s;ea-faring people, he was from his infancy bred up a mariner. His di&s;po&s;ition naturally inclining him to ramble, he embraced every opportunity to embark in new voyages, and there was hardly a corner of the earth which he had not vi&s;ited before he was thirty years of age. When he was made choice of to take the command of the expedition of which we are now to give an account, he was e&s;teemed, and that perhaps ju&s;tly, the mo&s;t ex|perienced &s;eaman of his time. He had been frequently in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies; had been in the Northern and Mediterranean Seas, and had once &s;urrounded the whole globe. He was that Clippington, who, in 1704, with a bark, of only 10 tons, two ma&s;ts, two &s;quare-&s;ails, two pattararoes, and 21 men, left Cap|tain
<PB N="92" REF="96">
Dampier on the coa&s;t of Mexico; and, af|ter in&s;ulting Rio Leon, where he took two Spani&s;h &s;hips at anchor, one of which was ran|&s;omed for 4000 pieces of eight, and after vi&s;it|ing the gulph of Salinas, where he cleaned and refitted his little bark, undertook to &s;ail in her from that coa&s;t round half the globe; a great part of which he performed in a track never be|fore attempted, pur&s;uing his cour&s;e in the 18th degree of north latitude, which former naviga|tors had pur&s;ued after each other in the 13th; and, in that direction, he reached the Philip|pines in 54 days, without &s;eeing land, or meet|ing with any cro&s;s accident to interrupt his pa&s;&s;age. While he was embarra&s;&s;ed among tho&s;e i&s;lands, there came off a canoe with a friar on board, to enquire concerning &s;o uncommon a ve&s;&s;el, the like of which was never &s;een before in tho&s;e &s;eas. He detained the friar till his crew were furni&s;hed with fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and then re|lea&s;ed him.</P>
<P>From the Philippines we &s;teered to Pulo Con|dore, where he expected to have met with an Engli&s;h &s;ettlement; but, to his great mortifica|tion, he there learnt, that, &s;ome time before his arrival, the Engli&s;h had been all murdered by their Indian guards. Upon this melancholy news, he bore away for Macao, a port in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Portugue&s;e, near the mouth of the river Canton, in China, already frequently men|tioned, and lately made famous by the arrival of &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian adventurers from Kamp&s;chatka,
<PB N="93" REF="97">
who, by that navigation, have confirmed the reality of a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the coa&s;ts of China. At this Port he arrived, where Shel|vock affirms that near half his crew were hang|ed for pirates, that the re&s;t e&s;caped, &s;ome to one place, and &s;ome to another; that Clipperton him&s;elf being deprived of his little boat, found means to get on board an Engli&s;h Ea&s;t India|man at Canton, and arrived in England in 1706.</P>
<P>Clipperton was a blunt, rough, free-&s;poken &s;ailor, had not much the air of a gentle|man, and therefore never affected it; was free and ea&s;y among his &s;eamen; and, though he was pa&s;&s;ionate, he was &s;oon appea&s;ed, and, if in the wrong, ever ready to acknowledge his error, and to repair any injury his ha&s;ty temper be|trayed him to commit. He had a &s;trict regard to what he thought his duty, and was not to be diverted from the principles of moderation, which ever inclined him to acts of mercy and humanity towards tho&s;e over whom the chance of war gave him the &s;uperiority. Having re|turned almo&s;t de&s;titute from his fir&s;t voyage round the world, he &s;ettled in the north of Ire|land, to which retreat he was traced, after more than twelve years retirement, and per&s;uaded to undertake this &s;econd voyage, as a means to re|pair his broken fortune.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s that had attended the voyage of the Duke and Dutche&s;s to the South Seas under the command of Captain Rogers, had revived the
<PB N="94" REF="98">
&s;pirit of privateering, which, by former mi&s;car|riages, had been reduced to a very low ebb. Dampier, as has already been noticed, was un|able, with all his &s;kill and all his experience, to per&s;uade the London merchants to engage in a &s;econd expedition into tho&s;e &s;eas, after having failed in the fir&s;t, and was obliged to apply to Bri&s;tol to rai&s;e a new company of adventurers to &s;econd his views; but &s;uch is the nature of man|kind, that emulous, not to &s;ay envious, of the &s;ucce&s;s of others, they are ever ready to croud the road that has led to fortune, without con&s;i|dering how unfit they are to undertake the jour|ney. The owners of the Duke and Dutche&s;s had been particularly careful to make choice of gentlemen, not only of ability, to conduct the voyage which proved &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, but who al&s;o had confidence in, and friend&s;hip for, each other; and yet, with all this care and caution, it was with the greate&s;t difficulty in the world that they were per&s;uaded to keep together, and to act in concert. On the contrary, the Commanders in the pre&s;ent expedition, were gentlemen of oppo|&s;ite tempers, oppo&s;ite views, and already, before they &s;et out, engaged in oppo&s;ite parties; it was therefore very unlikely that two &s;uch Com|manders &s;hould unite in one common intere&s;t, or that the one &s;hould &s;hare the danger where the other was to reap the glory. The event will &s;hew, that the mi&s;carriage of this enterprize was not more owing to the mi&s;takes in the voyage, than in the wrong &s;etting out.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="99">The impatience of the undertakers was &s;o great, and their confidence of making them&s;elves rich by the plunder of the Spaniards &s;o certain, that, unwilling to tru&s;t to an eventual rupture between Great Britain and Spain, they took oc|ca&s;ion, from the war that then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Emperor and Spain, to apply to the Imperial Court for a commi&s;&s;ion to carry their plan of ho&s;tilities into execution. With this view, hav|ing equipped two &s;tout &s;hips, the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> and the <HI>Speedwell,</HI> it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to find out &s;ome gentleman who had &s;erved on board the royal navy, that might take upon him the com|mand of the expedition, and be able to act with propriety in a joint commi&s;&s;ion, wherein Flemi&s;h &s;oldiers and Engli&s;h &s;ailors were to be united in the &s;ame de&s;ign.</P>
<P>For this difficult ta&s;k no man was thought more fit than Captain George Shelvock, who had been bred from his childhood in the royal navy, had been thirty years in the &s;ervice, and arrived at the rank of Fir&s;t Lieutenant of one of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war, which he had borne with great reputation; was in his per&s;on and behaviour a fine gentleman, and was confe&s;&s;edly a very expert and able &s;eaman. He was, be&s;ides, of quick parts, ready &s;peech, and very winning addre&s;s, but withal rather too &s;en&s;ible of his own accompli&s;hments. This gentleman the un|dertakers thought them&s;elves happy in having found; and they accordingly not only inve&s;ted him with the command, but entru&s;ted to him the
<PB N="96" REF="100">
grand bu&s;ine&s;s of the commi&s;&s;ion, and for that purpo&s;e he received in&s;tructions to repair to O&s;tend with the Speedwell, and there, as &s;oon as the commi&s;&s;ion was obtained, to take on board the complement of Flemings that were to give countenance to the undertaking; and to join the Succe&s;s in the Downs, which there lay ready un|der the command of Capt. Mitchel. On this oc|ca&s;ion the names of the &s;hips were changed; the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> was called the <HI>Prince Eugene,</HI> and the <HI>Speed|well</HI> the <HI>Starenberg,</HI> in compliment to the Prince and the Imperial Prime Mini&s;ter. Capt. Shelvock was, be&s;ides, in&s;tructed to lay in &s;uch a &s;tock of wines and &s;pirituous liquors, as he &s;hould judge &s;ufficient for the u&s;e of both &s;hips in a voyage where &s;uch refre&s;hments would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and without which the climate of Cape Horn could hardly be endured.</P>
<P>In this bu&s;ine&s;s, however, the Captain gave &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t. He was either too extravagant, too o&s;tentatious, or too remi&s;s; and the voyage which the owners had &s;o much at heart, was thought already to have &s;uffered by unnece&s;&s;ary delay. But, what was &s;till wor&s;e, the Flemi&s;h &s;oldiers, 90 in number, commanded by their own officers, had hardly arrived in the Downs before they became &s;o in&s;olent, that it was pre&s;ently di&s;|covered, that the &s;cheme of their acting in con|cert with Engli&s;h &s;ailors was utterly impracti|cable: &s;o that after all this delay and ex|pence, the commi&s;&s;ion was returned, the Flemi&s;h &s;oldiers di&s;charged, and a new plan formed,
<PB N="97" REF="101">
which gave the fir&s;t occa&s;ion to tho&s;e di&s;&s;entions that in the end proved the ruin of the voyage.</P>
<P>Captain Shelvock's management had much le&s;&s;ened his credit, and his friends were unable to &s;upport his intere&s;t. The rea&s;on for his ad|vancement no longer exi&s;ted; and it was found, that the di&s;cipline to which he had been accu&s;|tomed on board the royal navy, was not the di&s;|cipline to be practi&s;ed on board privateers. It was nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, as the circum&s;tances of things were changed, war with Spain declared, and no extraordinary accompli&s;hment required, to look out for an officer to take the command, who had experience in the bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was to be employed; who knew the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of America, and was acquainted with the genius of the people with whom he was to con|tend, as well as the tempers of tho&s;e with whom he was to attack.</P>
<P>On this new regulation, the character of Cap|tain Clipperton was called to mind. He was known to &s;ome of the owners, and &s;trongly re|commended by other merchants, as of all men then living the fitte&s;t to be entru&s;ted with the conduct of &s;uch an expedition. The owners, who had already expended more than 15,000 l. began to con&s;ider their own intere&s;t without re|&s;pect to per&s;ons; and, therefore, they &s;ought out and inve&s;ted Captain Clipperton with the chief command, continuing Captain Shelvock Com|mander of the Speedwell, and appointing Cap|tain Mitchell &s;econd to Captain Clipperton, and
<PB N="98" REF="102">
Captain Hatley &s;econd Captain to Shelvock. The &s;hips were re&s;tored to their former names, an Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ion procured for the Command|ers, and every thing prepared while the &s;hips lay in the Downs for their immediate departure.</P>
<P>The in&s;tructions given to the re&s;pective Com|manders were, in &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ame with tho&s;e given to the Commanders of the Duke and Dutche&s;s, &s;trongly recommending unanimity. But this precaution proved wholly u&s;ele&s;s. The expedition wore an unfortunate a&s;pect from the beginning. The &s;hips were obliged to lie three months at Plymouth, waiting for a wind. Fac|tions were in the mean time formed, in which the crews as well as the Commanders were involved. Captain Shelvock highly re&s;ented the affront that had been offered in depriving him of the chief command; and Captain Clipperton, being a boi&s;terous man, having him&s;elf &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and not having art to conceal them, knowing Captain Shelvock's prejudices, nothing but di&s;&s;ention and di&s;cord prevailed. Every po&s;t brought the owners fre&s;h complaints; and every po&s;t carried fre&s;h reproofs to the Commanders. In this humour the parties continued while the &s;hips lay at Plymouth. At length,</P>
<P>On the 13th of February, 1719, the Succe&s;s, of 36 guns, and 180 men, commanded by Cap|tain Clipperton, and the Speedwell, of 24 guns, and 106 men, of which Captain Shelvock was Commander, &s;ailed with a fair wind; but, by an
<PB N="99" REF="103">
unaccountable over-&s;ight, the Speedwell had on board the whole &s;tock of wine and brandy, and the Succe&s;s the greate&s;t &s;hare of other &s;tores.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days they had fre&s;h gales, &s;qually, with rain, and the Succe&s;s was often obliged to &s;horten &s;ail for the Speedwell. Captain Shel|vock tells us, that he complained to Captain Clipperton of the crankne&s;s of his &s;hip, and de|&s;ired him to &s;end for his wine and brandy, that he might &s;trike down &s;ome of his guns into the hold, which would enable him to &s;ail much bet|ter than he did: but this, it &s;eems, was neglect|ed; a proof that Clipperton had no intention to de&s;ert the Speedwell, though it was a &s;light, which Shelvock could not but re&s;ent. On the 19th, a violent &s;torm aro&s;e, which obliged both &s;hips to take in their top-&s;ails. The gale in|crea&s;ing, the Succe&s;s made a &s;ignal for the Speed|well to bring to; which Captain Shelvock readily obeyed; and, by eleven at night, both &s;hips were under bare poles. On the 20th, in the afternoon, the &s;torm abated, and Captain Clipperton made &s;ail, &s;teering S. by E. where|as Captain Shelvock, according to his journal, &s;tood north we&s;t; &s;o that from this day they never &s;aw each other, till they met in the South Seas by mere accident. Here then pro|perly begins the hi&s;tory of Captain Clipperton's voyage round the world. He was now at &s;ea without liquors, and without his con&s;ort. The fir&s;t place of rendezvous appointed by them, was the Canary I&s;lands; and, therefore, he &s;ail|ed
<PB N="100" REF="104">
thither, and arrived at Gomera on the 5th of March. Having taken in &s;ome wine and re|fre&s;hments, for which he had great occa&s;ion, he continued crui&s;ing at the Canaries ten days for his con&s;ort; but, mi&s;&s;ing her here, he continued his voyage to the next place of rendezvous, at the Cape de Verd or Green i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The former i&s;lands, called by the ancients the Fortunate I&s;lands, from their fertility and tempe|rate air, were di&s;covered by the Spaniards in 1402, who named them the Canaries, or the I&s;lands of Dogs, becau&s;e no other creatures were found on them. They are eight in number. The Great Canary is the large&s;t, is far di&s;tant from the others, and contains 9000 inhabitants. It is the &s;eat of the Bi&s;hop, the Inqui&s;ition, and of the Council Royal. There is a mountain on the Teneriff, called the Pike of Teneriff, which, according to the common opinion, is the highe&s;t in the world. It may be di&s;tinctly &s;een at &s;ixty leagues di&s;tance. It is three days journey to the top of it, which, except in the months of July and Augu&s;t, is always covered with &s;now. Fero is one of the large&s;t, but &s;o dry, that there is not one drop of fre&s;h water to be found in it, except in a few places by the &s;ea-&s;ide: but Pro|vidence has furni&s;hed a &s;upply to remedy that inconvenience; for there grows all over this i&s;land a &s;ort of tree, which is pretty large, and full of leaves, that are always green, and co|vered with a little cloud that wets the leaves by its dew, &s;o that a fine clear water di&s;tills from
<PB N="101" REF="105">
them into little pails, which the inhabitants &s;et to catch it. This water falls in &s;uch quantities, that it not only abundantly &s;upplies the nece&s;&s;ity of the people, but it is &s;ufficient al&s;o to water the cattle. The Canaries in general are very fertile, and abound with wine that is tran&s;ported into all parts of the world. On the right-hand of tho&s;e i&s;lands, about 100 leagues off, the ma|riners very often perceived an i&s;land named St. Baranora, inhabited, they &s;ay, by Chri&s;tians; but no man can tell of what denomination they are, nor what language they &s;peak. The Spa|niards have often attempted to enter it, but could never find the way; which has rai&s;ed an opinion in the people, that it is an inchanted i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t they &s;aw St. Vincent's, and the next morning anchored in the bay. Here they &s;pent ten days crui&s;ing in hopes of meeting with their con&s;ort, but in vain; which &s;o di&s;heartened the crew, that Capt. Clipperton found it diffi|cult to per&s;uade them to continue the voyage for the Straits of Magellan, without wine or brandy to keep up their &s;pirits in that uncom|fortable navigation. Some are of opinion, that the&s;e i&s;lands were called Green I&s;lands from the Green Cape of Africa, over-again&s;t which they lie; others, becau&s;e the &s;ea that &s;urrounds them is &s;o covered with a green herb, that you can hardly &s;ee the water; nor can &s;hips &s;ail through it, but with a &s;tiff gale of wind. It produces berries, much like white goo&s;eberries;
<PB N="102" REF="106">
but without ta&s;te. Nobody can tell how it grows; for there is no ground where it &s;toats upon the water, and it cannot come from the bottom, the &s;ea being in many places unfathom|able.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of April they left St. Vincent's, and on the 29th of May they had an ob&s;erva|tion, and found them&s;elves in lat. 52 deg. 15 min. S. being then off Cape Virgin Mary, the north point of the entrance of the Straits of Magellan. The next day they entered the Straits, and &s;ent their pinnace on &s;hore on the main, to a fre&s;h-water river, which was at this time frozen up. They &s;aw large flocks of gee&s;e and ducks, but very &s;hy. The &s;urgeon's mate, by &s;ome accident, was left on &s;hore; and next morning, when brought aboard, was near dead with cold. They anchored at Queen Elizabeth's I&s;land, and found great plenty of &s;mallage, which was of infinite &s;ervice to tho&s;e &s;ick of the &s;curvy. They eat it raw, boiled it in their &s;oups, and kept the juice of it in bottles. They met with plenty of wild-fowl and &s;hell-fi&s;h, filled their ca&s;ks with water, and continued their cour&s;e. On the 22d they anchored in a fine bay, which, from its depth, they called No-bottom Bay. The trees were high, loaded with &s;now, and exhibited a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing pro&s;pect. On the 29th came a canoe, with four Indians. They were of a middle &s;tature, dark com|plection, their faces broad and round, low fore|heads, black hair very lank and &s;hort, with no
<PB N="103" REF="107">
cloathing, except a piece of &s;kin to cover their middles. What &s;eemed mo&s;t remarkable, was a circle round their wri&s;ts, of a bright azure. It &s;eems the&s;e &s;avages are extremely jealous of their women; for, notwith&s;tanding all that could be &s;aid to them, they would not permit a wo|man, who was of their party, to come on board. Bougainville, and the Engli&s;h voyagers who lately pa&s;&s;ed the Straits, make the &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion. Capt. Clipperton ordered them bread and chee&s;e, and a dram of brandy, though it was very &s;carce. The former they eat very heartily, or rather greedily; but the latter they could not be prevailed upon to ta&s;te. They had bows and arrows, and &s;ome fi&s;hing-tackle along with them. After about two hours &s;tay, they rowed a&s;hore, making &s;igns that they would come again. The next day the pinnace was &s;ent a&s;hore, and returned in the evening with the Indian canoe laden with mu&s;cles, which the Indians had ex|changed for bread, knives, and other trifles. In the beginning of the month of July they found the weather moderate. The&s;e natives were a harmle&s;s people: one of the crew, being left on &s;hore, lived with them two nights and a day, and was very kindly treated by them; which &s;hews, that, if they are well u&s;ed, they are not treacherous. All this time their &s;hip's company were very &s;ickly, and &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;ed but &s;ome one or other died. On July 8 they buried their ma&s;ter-gunner. They cau&s;ed a &s;trong plank to be driven at the head of his
<PB N="104" REF="108">
grave, on which was the following in&s;cription: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. William Pridham, gunner of the Succe&s;s, decea&s;ed July 7, 1719, in this Strait, and lies buried here."</Q> On the 20th Capt. Mitchell and Lieut. David&s;on went in the pinnace to Terra del Fuego, in order to make di&s;covery of the pa&s;&s;age that a French Tartan is &s;aid to have went through into the South Sea, May 1713, and to &s;ee if there was any anchoring beyond Cape Quad. On the 29th they returned, having found the pa&s;&s;age, but &s;o narrow, that it was judged hazardous to go that way. They found likewi&s;e &s;everal good bays to the north-we&s;t of Cape Quad to anchor in. The Indians brought them a &s;eal, which they broiled and roa&s;ted, and &s;aid it eat like veni&s;on.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 1, they re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute their voyage thro' the Straits, which, with much dan|ger and difficulty, they accompli&s;hed. Aug. 18, they arrived in the South Seas, but &s;o weak, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to undertake any thing immediately; they therefore &s;teered directly for the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, the third and la&s;t place of rendezvous, where they arrived Sept. 7, and &s;earched diligently in hopes of finding &s;ome token of the Speedwell, but to to manner of purpo&s;e. According to his in&s;tructions, Clip|perton continued to crui&s;e a full month, and, before he took his departure, ordered an in&s;crip|tion to be cut on a remarkable tree fronting the landing-place; &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;hip's crew to come a&s;hore, and not &s;ee
<PB N="105" REF="109">
it. The in&s;cription thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"CAPTAIN JOHN W. MAGEE, 1719."</Q> This William Magee was &s;urgeon on board the Succe&s;s, was well-known to Capt. Shelvock, and all the &s;hip's company, and therefore his name was made choice of rather than the Captain's, for a blind in ca&s;e the in&s;cription &s;hould be read by the Spaniards. Here the &s;ick were &s;et a&s;hore, and every means u&s;ed for their recovery; but the very thoughts of being without any cordial to comfort them, dejected them exce&s;&s;ively. The weather was changeable; abundance of rain fell; and they had al&s;o &s;ome hard gales of wind. They took goats in plenty, which not only &s;erved them for the pre&s;ent, but likewi&s;e in|crea&s;ed their &s;ea &s;tore, having &s;alted a great number with &s;alt they found on the i&s;land ready-made. They likewi&s;e wooded and watered, and cleaned their &s;hip, ready for action in the South-Seas, where it was now vi&s;ible they were to crui&s;e alone; for Clipperton was of opinion the Speedwell was lo&s;t; or at lea&s;t he gave out &s;o, to pacify his company, who were continually cur&s;ing Capt. Shelvock for running away with their liquors. One thing remarkable was, the beauty and fertility of this i&s;land, added to the &s;tories they had heard of others, tempted four of Clipperton's men, with a view of remaining there, to betake them&s;elves to the mountains, where two of them were made pri&s;oners by the goat-hunters, who were forced to fire at them &s;everal times before they would &s;urrender.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="110">October 7, they prepared to &s;ail; and, in the mean time, Captain Mitchell went on &s;hore, to &s;et up a cro&s;s already cut for that purpo&s;e, at the foot of which he buried a bottle, in which was contained a letter for Captain Shelvock, direct|ing another place of rendezvous, and &s;ome pro|per &s;ignal to know each other by at &s;ea. At eight in the morning they weighed from the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, and left their two men in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, of whom more hereafter.</P>
<P>After leaving this i&s;land, Captain Clipperton &s;ailed northward, till he was in the parallel of Lima, where he intended to act, though he was now in a very indifferent condition, having lo&s;t thirty men &s;ince his pa&s;&s;ing the Equator; and the remaining crew expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s in relation to plunder, he cau&s;ed a paper to be fix|ed to the main-ma&s;t, which was a&s;&s;ented to by the whole &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>On October 25, they gave chace to a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and took her. Being their fir&s;t prize, &s;he was an ill omen of their future &s;ucce&s;s. She was a &s;how of 40 tons, laden with &s;and and rubbi&s;h for manure, had &s;even Indians and two negroes on board; and all the captors could find worth taking, was two jars of eggs, as much treacle, and a couple of pieces of eight in ready money. The next day, they met with a &s;hip called the St. Vincent, of 150 tons, laden with wood from Guiaquil, with two friars, &s;ixteen Indians, and four negroes aboard. On the 30th, they took a large &s;hip called the Trinity, of 400 tons, taken
<PB N="107" REF="111">
by Captain Rogers when he plundered Guiaquil ten years before. She had a great many pa&s;&s;en|gers on board, and a cargo of con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P>On Nov. 2, they took another prize, of 70 tons, with the Counte&s;s of Laguna and &s;everal other pa&s;&s;engers on board, a great deal of money, and upwards of 400 jars of wine and brandy, articles very much wanted. Captain Clipperton de&s;ired the Counte&s;s to make her choice, either to &s;tay on board the prize, or accept of the ac|commodations they were able to afford her on board the Succe&s;s. She cho&s;e the former; and the Captain &s;ent an officer with &s;trict orders to &s;uffer nobody to enter her cabbin but her own dome&s;tics: he likewi&s;e appropriated a part of the wine and brandy found on board the prizes for the u&s;e of his &s;eamen, to whom, no doubt, it was a welcome refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>He had already detached &s;everal officers, and above a third part of his company, to take care of his prizes; and yet was as eager to take more, as if, in&s;tead of a privateer weakly manned, he had commanded a &s;quadron of &s;hips of war. On the 12th he di&s;covered, at &s;ome di&s;tance, a Lon|don-built pink, of 200 tons, laden with wood, named the Ro&s;ario, the Ma&s;ter of which being a very cunning fellow, &s;oon &s;aw the error that Clip|perton had committed, and re&s;olved to take ad|vantage of it. He gue&s;&s;ed, by the number of prizes, that many men could not be &s;ent on board his &s;hip; and, having about a dozen pa&s;|&s;engers, he directed them, under the command
<PB N="108" REF="112">
of a French boat&s;wain, to hide them&s;elves in the hold, with orders, on his making a certain &s;ignal, to &s;eize as many of the Engli&s;h as came down; a&s;&s;uring them, that he, with the &s;hip's company, would be able to manage the re&s;t. As &s;oon as the &s;hip &s;truck, Captain Clipperton &s;ent Lieu|tenant Serjeant&s;on, with eight men, to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her; who, as &s;oon as he came on board, ordered all that appeared into the great cabin, and placed a centinel at the door of it. Think|ing every thing &s;ecure, and not in the lea&s;t ap|prehen&s;ive of danger, he with &s;ome of his men went into the hold to &s;ee what was in the &s;hip; on which the pa&s;&s;engers, who were concealed, &s;allied out, knocked mo&s;t of them down, and the French boat&s;wain, coming behind Mr. Ser|jeant&s;on, knocked him down likewi&s;e, and then ordered them to be all bound. The Spaniards in the great cabin &s;ecured the centinel; and, hav|ing thus recovered their &s;hip, made in&s;tantly for the &s;hore, where their own company and the pri&s;oners were all in equal danger of peri&s;hing; which the Captain no &s;ooner perceived, than he ordered the Engli&s;h to be unbound; and, by good fortune every man e&s;caped upon the rocks, again&s;t which the Spaniard in his eagerne&s;s had run his ve&s;&s;el, and again&s;t which &s;he was da&s;hed to pieces. Lieutenant Serjeant&s;on and his peo|ple were &s;ecured, and &s;ent pri&s;oners to Lima. The Viceroy of Peru was no &s;ooner acquainted with this gallant action, than he ordered a new &s;hip to be built at Guiaquil for the Captain, and

taxed the traders towards the expence of her, intending this as a reward for the &s;ervice he had rendered the public, and hoping thereby to en|courage others to behave as nobly. On the ar|rival of the pri&s;oners at Lima, they were clo&s;ely examined; and one of them gave a full account of every thing he knew, particularly of the two men left upon the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, and of the bottle with a letter in it; upon which, the Viceroy ordered a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to be fitted out, to fetch both the one and the other, which was accordingly performed.</P>
<P>It was not till the 20th that Captain Clipper|ton perceived that his la&s;t prize was retaken; when, con&s;idering what was be&s;t to be done, he prudently determined to &s;et his Spani&s;h pri&s;oners at liberty, as well to &s;ave provi&s;ions, which, at that time, he could very ill &s;pare, as that their good u&s;age might be &s;peedily known, and re|turned to &s;uch of his men as were in the enemy's power.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the 27th, they came to an anchor with all their prizes, at the i&s;land of La Plata, and, in his way, took another prize, call|ed the Cayetan, of 200 tons, having on board 40 negroes, and 30 Spaniards, mo&s;t of them pa&s;&s;en|gers. Here the Captain began &s;eriou&s;ly to con|&s;ider how he &s;hould make the mo&s;t of this ex|pedition for his owners, as well as him&s;elf, and his company. He knew that all the coa&s;t was alarmed; and that two men of war, one of fifty, and one of thirty guns, were fitted out on pur|po&s;e
<PB N="110" REF="114">
to take him: he was &s;en&s;ible, that the goods he had on board were not likely to be ran&s;omed in that part of the world; and that they would prove mere drugs, if brought into this; and therefore laid all the&s;e things toge|ther; and, reflecting on a propo&s;ition made by Captain Woods Rogers, to &s;end a cargo of &s;uch prize-goods to Brazil, he re&s;olved to try the experiment; and, accordingly, he fitted out the bark in which he took the Counte&s;s of La|guna; mounted her with eight guns; and, putting on board of her thirteen Engli&s;hmen, and ten negroes, with what provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries he could &s;pare, he &s;ent her with a cargo of European commodities, valued at 10,000 pounds, for Brazil, under the command of Captain Mitchell, his &s;econd in command. As &s;oon as he was gone, the Captain parted with all his other prizes, pre&s;enting them to the Spa|ni&s;h pri&s;oners, after taking out of them what he thought valuable, and detaining only the Captain of one of them for his pilot, and all the negroes; after which he &s;ailed from that i&s;land, in order to cruize in his former &s;tation.</P>
<P>December 12, they &s;aw a &s;ail about five in the evening, and, at &s;even, took her. She was called the Ro&s;ary, and laden with provi&s;ions. The launch and pinnace were all the next day employed in bringing on board the cargo, and having got out of her as much as they could &s;tow, they cut her main-ma&s;t by the board, le&s;t
<PB N="111" REF="115">
&s;he &s;hould over&s;et, and &s;o let her go. The pri|&s;oners informed them that the men taken by the Ro&s;ario were &s;ent to Lima by land. On the 27th they looked into Guanchaco bay, and found two &s;hips at anchor. They fired a &s;hot at each, but they made no return. Sending then their boats aboard, they found them abandoned, and could di&s;cover nothing left, except &s;ome bread, and a few jars of water. They hung out a flag of truce, and fired two guns at half an hour's interval, hoping they would have come aboard to ran&s;om their &s;hips. They were an&s;wered from &s;hore; but no boat coming, they waited till next day, and then &s;et them on fire.</P>
<P>It was now re&s;olved to bear away for refre&s;h|ment to the Gallapagos i&s;lands, where they might remain unmole&s;ted till the alarm of their being in tho&s;e &s;eas &s;hould be over; and, ac|cordingly, put their de&s;ign in execution. On January 9, 1720, they anchored on the north &s;ide of the Duke of York's i&s;land, immediately under the Equinoctial, where they found good water, and cleaned their &s;hip, which confirms the account given by Captain Cowley, though Captain Rogers could not find the place.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of January they ob&s;erved a &s;ail, and about eleven at night came up with her; and, on firing of their fir&s;t gun, &s;he &s;truck. She was called the Prince Eugene, and had on board the Marquis de Villa Roche, and all his family, who were going to Lima.</P>
<P>On February 26th, a Spaniard dying of a
<PB N="112" REF="116">
wound he had received at the taking this &s;hip, the Marquis de&s;ired he might be buried accord|ing to their ceremonies; which was granted. When the office for the dead had been perform|ed, and the corp&s;e thrown over board, with a large bag of balla&s;t tied at his feet, the Spaniards crying thrice, as their cu&s;tom is on &s;uch occa|&s;ion, <HI>Bon Voiage,</HI> i. e. a good voyage, the body, to the admiration of every one, pre&s;ently floated, and continued floating as far as they could &s;ee it; which the Marquis concluded to be an ill omen, and declared that &s;ome &s;urpri&s;|ing accident would be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>On March 8, a prie&s;t, who was on board the Prince Eugene, de&s;ired leave to go on &s;hore on the i&s;land of Velas; which was granted, on his promi&s;ing to per&s;uade the inhabitants to drive &s;ome black cattle to the &s;hore, in order to ex|change them for what goods they liked be&s;t. On the 16th, he returned with four head of black cattle, &s;ome fowls, and fruit, as a pre&s;ent to the Marquis; but at the &s;ame time declared, that the Governor would not &s;uffer the inhabi|tants to trade. He &s;aid, Captain Mitchell had been a&s;hore there, and had &s;hot &s;ome of their cattle; but that 200 men appearing under arms, they had forced him to retire. The next day &s;ome letters from the Marquis were intercepted, very little to his honour, &s;ince they tended to &s;tir up the people to &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;ecure the boat when it came next a&s;hore to water. Upon this, Captain Clipperton confined him for &s;ome
<PB N="113" REF="117">
days; yet, on the 20th, he allowed both the Marquis and his lady to go a&s;hore, leaving their only child as an ho&s;tage.</P>
<P>On April 14, the Marquis, his lady, and the Governor, came aboard; and, an agreement be|ing made for their ran&s;om, the lady and child were &s;ent on &s;hore, and the Marquis only re|mained as an ho&s;tage. In this tran&s;action Clip|perton appears to have been outwitted by this nobleman, who ba&s;ely broke his word, and pro|voked the crew for tru&s;ting him. On April 20th, they anchored in the gulph of Amapala; and, not being able to water there, repaired to the i&s;land of Tigers, where they did it with great ea&s;e. On June 4, they &s;ailed to Gorgona on the &s;ame errand, and were well &s;upplied. On the 24th, they made prize a &s;econd time of the St. Vincent, now commanded by Don Clement de Andrado, laden with timber and cocoa-nuts. On Augu&s;t 11, they anchored, with their prize, at the i&s;land of Lobos de la Mar, where they &s;et up tents on the &s;hore, &s;crubbed and cleaned their &s;hip, and where the crew talked over their affairs, till they began to think them de&s;perate. Sometimes, they reflected on the Captain, for pretending to remain in the&s;e &s;eas without their con&s;ort; at other times, they blamed him for giving in to the Spani&s;h Marquis's project for ran&s;oming his &s;hip, which, they believed, would never be performed: and, now-and-then, the &s;hip's corporal, one James Roch, a bold, bu&s;y, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ntriguing fellow, threw in &s;ome &s;ly in&s;inuations,
<PB N="114" REF="118">
that, if they mu&s;t go through &s;uch hard&s;hips, it was better they &s;hould do it for their own &s;akes, than for other peoples; and one Jo&s;eph Maynard, the boat&s;wain's mate, pu&s;hing things &s;till further, a plot was at la&s;t formed for &s;eizing the Captain, the re&s;t of the officers, and run|ning away with the &s;hip. They likewi&s;e agreed, that, when their de&s;ign was brought to bear, the officers &s;hould be &s;et on &s;hore on the i&s;land of Lobos, and all who afterwards oppo&s;ed them &s;hot without mercy. This wicked combination, however, was happily di&s;covered, the two ring|leaders &s;everely puni&s;hed, and the re&s;t pardoned; by which wi&s;e conduct the con&s;piracy was &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. On the 17th they took a fi&s;hing-boat, with a large quantity of &s;alt-fi&s;h well cured; but found the St. Vincent, which they had left at an anchor under the i&s;land of Lobos, driven a&s;hore, and &s;unk: here they put thirty-eight Spani&s;h pri&s;oners on board the fi&s;hing-boat, and &s;ent them away.</P>
<P>Nov. 1, they entered the bay of Conception, where, mi&s;&s;ing a prize that out&s;ailed them, they bore away for Coquimbo, and took a &s;hip laden with tobacco, &s;ugar, and cloth, in their pa&s;&s;age. On the 6th, in the afternoon, they opened that harbour, where they &s;aw three men of war lying, with their top-&s;ails loo&s;e; and the&s;e no &s;ooner &s;pied them, than they cut their cables, and &s;tood after them. The Succe&s;s hauled clo&s;e on a wind, and the prize did the &s;ame; upon which the Spani&s;h man of-war that &s;ailed be&s;t gave
<PB N="115" REF="119">
chace to the latter, and took her. The other two &s;hips crouded all the &s;ail they could to come up with the Succe&s;s, but &s;he out&s;ailing them, made her e&s;cape. In the Spani&s;h prize they lo&s;t their third Lieutenant, Mr. James Milne, and twelve of their be&s;t men. The Captain who took him was the famous Don Blas de Le&s;&s;o, Governor of Carthagena, when attacked by Ad|miral Vernon. Don Blas treated his pri&s;oner a little roughly at fir&s;t, being enraged to find he had mi&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h privateer, and only re|taken a Spani&s;h prize; and, in the fir&s;t tran&s;port of his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;truck Mr. Milne on the head with the flat of his &s;word; but, when he came to him&s;elf, he &s;ent for him, and, finding him &s;tripped by his &s;oldiers, generou&s;ly a&s;ked his pardon, ordered him a new &s;uit of cloaths, and kept him for &s;ome time on board his &s;hip. He afterwards procured his liberty at Lima, paid or his pa&s;&s;age to Panama, where he gave him a jar of brandy, and another of wine, for his &s;ea-&s;tores, put 200 pieces of eight in his pocket, and &s;ent him to England. This unlucky acci|dent of lo&s;ing their prize revived the ill humours among Clipperton's men, who did not indeed plot again, but became exceedingly dejected. On the 16th they &s;aw another &s;ail, and gave chace, which, after a few guns fired on both &s;ides, bore away, being a clean &s;hip, and left them, which proved a lucky e&s;cape; for this was likewi&s;e a &s;hip of force, fitted out to take Capt. Shelvock, and commanded by one Fitz|gerald,
<PB N="116" REF="120">
who, knowing this was not Shelvock's &s;hip, and doubting what &s;trength &s;he might be of, had no great &s;tomach to engage her. The&s;e repeated di&s;appointments, as they broke the &s;pirits of his crew, &s;o they had a very bad ef|fect on Capt. Clipperton him&s;elf, who began now to betake him&s;elf to drinking; and, as this vice generally grows upon people under misfor|tunes, he drank at la&s;t to &s;uch an exce&s;s, that he was hardly ever quite cool or &s;ober. It was chiefly owing to this unhappy practice, that he fell into many errors in his future conduct. They were now in want of provi&s;ions, and they re&s;olved to continue crui&s;ing to the north, to &s;eek a &s;upply. In this crui&s;e they had but in|different &s;ucce&s;s; and, therefore, on the 27th, they &s;et a&s;hore their Spani&s;h pri&s;oners, and then determined to go once more to the Gallapagos in order to refre&s;h. In their pa&s;&s;age to the&s;e i&s;lands, they began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome error in their log-line; and, upon mea&s;uring, found it three fathoms too &s;hort.</P>
<P>On the 4th of December, they lo&s;t their pur|&s;er; and the &s;ame day found them&s;elves very near the Gallapagos i&s;lands, but could find no anchoring-place, nor any fre&s;h-water, though they had found a fine road on their fir&s;t vi&s;it, which gave Shelvock occa&s;ion to charge Clipper|ton with want of &s;kill; they therefore made the be&s;t way they could to the I&s;le of Cocoas, where they hoped certainly to get &s;ome fi&s;h, fowl, and cocoa-nuts, mo&s;t of their people being very &s;ick
<PB N="117" REF="121">
and weak. On the 17th in the morning they came in &s;ight of it, which filled them with in|expre&s;&s;ible joy. On the 18th, all that could be &s;pared went on &s;hore to build a kind of booth for the reception of their &s;ick, who were all con|veniently lodged. The Captain opened here the la&s;t ca&s;k of brandy for the u&s;e of the &s;hip's com|pany, and gave every man a dram a day; and, on New-Year's-day, he allowed a gallon of &s;trong beer to every me&s;s; and, by having here plenty of nouri&s;hing food and much ea&s;e, the crew began to recover, and were able to wood and water, though with much difficulty.</P>
<P>On the 17th of January, 1721, the Captain made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions for &s;ailing; but, when they came to mu&s;ter the men, there were no le&s;s than eleven mi&s;&s;ing, three Engli&s;hmen, and eight negroes, who cho&s;e rather to remain in this unfrequented i&s;land, than continue ex|po&s;ed to dangers and fatigues on board, and to their living con&s;tantly at &s;hort allowance.</P>
<P>On the 25th, they arrived on the coa&s;t of Mexico, where, di&s;covering a &s;ail, they &s;ent their pinnace to give her chace; to whom &s;he in&s;tantly &s;truck. She proved to be Je&s;u Maria, commanded by Capt. Shelvock; and the account he gave was, That he had no more than forty men alive, the re&s;t being all dead, or di&s;per&s;ed; that he had lo&s;t the Speedwell at Juan Fernan|dez, where they built a bark out of the wreck; that they had coa&s;ted along Chili and Peru, till they came to Pi&s;co, near Lima, where they took
<PB N="118" REF="122">
this prize; that they had no regular command among them; that they had cho&s;en a quarter|ma&s;ter, carrying every thing by a majority of votes; and that they had quite broken their ar|ticles with their owners, and had &s;hared all among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>On the 27th, Captain Shelvock came aboard, being &s;ent for by Captain Clipperton and the agent, to give an account of his tran&s;actions. The boat brought Mr. Dod, Lieutenant of ma|rines, having been u&s;ed very ill for his attach|ment to the owners; at lea&s;t &s;o he a&s;&s;erted, and was firmly believed by Captain Clipperton, and his officers. The next day Captain Shelvock &s;ent on board them &s;ix che&s;ts of pitch and dam|mer, and two barrels of tar, with &s;ix &s;labs of copper: Captain Clipperton &s;pared him twenty-four quarter-deck guns, &s;ome great &s;hot, a com|pa&s;s, and a few other nece&s;&s;aries: his people purcha&s;ed cloaths, &s;hoes, hats, and other nece&s;|&s;aries; and Mr. Hendric the pur&s;er, and Mr. Dod, continued in the Succe&s;s, de&s;igning never more to &s;ail with Shelvock.</P>
<P>In the beginning of March, both time and place favouring, they determined to attempt the Manilla &s;hip, before &s;he entered Acapulco.</P>
<P>On the 13th, they again met Captain Shel|vock, and, at a general con&s;ultation, agreed to make the attempt jointly. But, previous to the &s;igning this agreement, it was propo&s;ed by Cap|tain Clipperton to form a joint &s;tock, to bury all former mi&s;carriages in oblivion, and again to
<PB N="119" REF="123">
act in concert for the good of the owners. This propo&s;ition was rejected by Captain Shelvock and his people, who did not care to part with what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; upon which Captain Clip|perton and his company, perceiving there was nothing to be expected from their con&s;ort, and that they were too weak of them&s;elves to effect their purpo&s;e, determined to &s;ail directly to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and in&s;tantly put their re&s;olution in execution, without waiting for or con&s;ulting Captain Shelvock.</P>
<P>The run from the coa&s;t of Mexico to the i&s;land of Guam, they performed in fifty-three days; and, May the 13th, anchored in the road of Umatta,&mdash;from whence they &s;ent their pin|nace a&s;hore, with a flag of truce, in order to obtain &s;ome provi&s;ions, which met at fir&s;t with a favourable reception, being told that, if they behaved civilly, and paid hone&s;tly, they &s;hould be furni&s;hed with what the i&s;land could afford. Soon after the launch arrived, and brought on board &s;ome cattle, bread, &s;ugar, greens, palm-wine, and brandy, from the Governor, with a large quantity of chocolate. In return for which, his health was drank by the whole &s;hip's crew, under a &s;alvo of &s;even guns: this was the la&s;t act of civility that pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>On the 18th of May, their pri&s;oner, the Mar|quis de Ville Roche, went a&s;hore, in company with the agent, the fir&s;t lieutenant and doctor, having previou&s;ly agreed with the Governor about his ran&s;om. Our launch was employed
<PB N="120" REF="124">
&s;ix days in bringing wood, water, and provi&s;ion aboard; during which time, the Governor de|&s;ired he might have &s;ome arms and ammunition in exchange: accordingly Captain Clipperton &s;ent him twelve fuzees, three jars of powder, &s;ixty round &s;hot, four pair of pi&s;tols, be&s;ides cutla&s;&s;es, long &s;words, and daggers. The 25th, they received a letter, in which the Governor demanded the Marquis's jewels, &s;ome con&s;ecrat|ed plate, and two negroes, being Chri&s;tians, and &s;ubjects to the King of Spain; as al&s;o a certificate, under the Captain and officers hands, that peace was proclaimed, detaining Mr. God|frey and Mr. Pritty till all this was performed. The Captain returned for an&s;wer, that the Solidad, the la&s;t prize taken on the coa&s;t of Chili, declared there was peace between Eng|land and Spain; but, withal, a&s;&s;ured the Go|vernor, that, if he did not, in twenty-four hours, &s;end the ran&s;om with the two gentlemen, he would demoli&s;h the hou&s;es upon the &s;hore, burn the &s;hip in the harbour, and do all the mi&s;chief he could at the Philippine i&s;lands.</P>
<P>After this declaration, ho&s;tilities commenced on both &s;ides. The people on &s;hore had rai&s;ed a battery from whence they fired at the pinnace. The &s;hip ran a-ground between two fires, one from the battery over their heads, and another from the &s;hip in the harbour. In endeavouring to get their &s;hip off, they ran foul of the rocks. The enemy fired &s;o warmly with &s;tones and &s;hot, that they &s;uffered extremely in their hull and

rigging. They had three men wounded, be|&s;ides the misfortune of lo&s;ing Mr. David&s;on, their fir&s;t Lieutenant, who was an hone&s;t man, and a good officer.</P>
<P>In this emergency, the Captain being over|come with liquor, the officers &s;igned a paper in|demnifying Mr. Cook for taking upon him the command. They cleared away the hold, ready to &s;tart their water, to make the &s;hip lighter; and got their upper and lower-deck guns forward, to bring her by the head, the &s;hip hanging abaft on the rock.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t twenty-four hours, they had happily only one man wounded; but the &s;hip was wretchedly torn and mangled between wind and water. The 30th, at &s;ix in the afternoon, the &s;hip floating, they cut away the yawl, &s;he being &s;unk with the &s;hot; the other boats were much da|maged; they hove to their &s;mall bower, then cut it away, and the other two haw&s;ers, and &s;ent their pinnace a-head, to tow the &s;hip off. Ju&s;t as they got afloat, the enemy fired &s;o &s;martly from the new battery, that their &s;hot raked them through between wind and water, killing one of their people, and wounding two others. They lo&s;t both their bow-anchors and cables, the &s;tern and kedge anchors, four haw&s;ers, four of their lower-deck guns, and nineteen barrels of powder, two men killed, and &s;ix wounded, having &s;tood for no le&s;s than fifty hours a fair mark for the enemy to fire at; and, if they had not got clear, it was believed they would have been &s;unk before
<PB N="122" REF="127">
morning. At ten in the forenoon they brought to, and began to &s;plice their rigging, not a rope of which e&s;caped a &s;hot. Their carpenters were employed in fixing the ma&s;ts and yards, and the re&s;t of their people in fixing the rigging. At &s;ix in the afternoon they took their departure, leav|ing Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Pritty in the hands of the enemy. This was certainly one of the wor&s;t errors committed by Clipperton; for he &s;hould never have quitted the Marquis, without having the ran&s;om in his hands.</P>
<P>On the 24th of June, they were in &s;ight of the Ba&s;hee I&s;lands; and, on the la&s;t day of the month, they &s;aw the i&s;land-&s;hoals of Prata.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of July, they fell in with other i&s;lands, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal boats that were fi&s;hing, though no &s;uch i&s;lands are laid down in any chart. They anchored under one of the&s;e i&s;lands, and di&s;patched their pinnace for intelligence; but not being able to learn their cour&s;e to Macao, nor to get a pilot, they determined to &s;ail for Amoy; before which port they arrived on the 5th in the evening, but were afraid to enter it in the night, and therefore plied off and on till day-light. They took notice of a great number of &s;nakes in the &s;ea, which were brought down by the ri|vers that empty them&s;elves on that coa&s;t. In the evening of the 6th of July, they entered the port, and were well plea&s;ed to find them&s;elves once more in a place where they might hope to obtain refre&s;hments, and to be able to repair the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r &s;hip; but they were no &s;ooner anchored in
<PB N="123" REF="128">
this port, than they had 10 cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers put on board them. The fir&s;t thing the&s;e cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e officers demanded was, what the &s;hip was reputed to be, and what bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he had there. Captain Clipperton an&s;wered, the &s;hip belonged to the King of Great Britain, and that &s;he put in there by &s;tre&s;s of weather, in order to obtain provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries. Next morn|ing, the men mutinied, and in&s;i&s;ted on being immediately paid their prize-money. Mr. Tay|lor, to whom we are indebted for this account, interpo&s;ing, one Edward Boreman told him, he had be&s;t de&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s he had a mind to have a brace of balls through his head. Mr. Cook, who commanded in the affair of Guam, and who &s;ucceeded Mr. David&s;on as Fir&s;t Lieutenant, now demanded thirty &s;hares, in right of his office; in which he was &s;upported by the men. Captain Clipperton, and the re&s;t of the officers, &s;eeing the turn things were likely to take, were very de&s;irous, that &s;ome allowance &s;hould be made to the officers that were taken pri&s;oners, and to Mr. Hendry and Mr. Dod, who joined them from the Speedwell: but the men would hear of no &s;uch allowances. Whil&s;t the&s;e di&s;putes la&s;ted, &s;ome took it into their heads to go a&s;hore, without a&s;king leave; and, when Captain Clip|perton would have corrected them, the whole company declared on their &s;ide, and prevented it. After this, all things fell into confu&s;ion: the men refu&s;ed to work till they had their prize-money; and, upon complaint, a guard of
<PB N="124" REF="129">
&s;oldiers was &s;ent on board, with a peremptory order from the Mandarin to Captain Clipperton to comply.</P>
<P>On September 16, the di&s;tribution was made; and no allowance being re&s;erved for &s;uch as were taken pri&s;oners, the repre&s;entatives of tho&s;e who were dead, or the two gentlemen who had &s;erv|ed on board the Speedwell, the prize-money of a fore-ma&s;t-man was 419 dollars. According to this di&s;tribution, the owners &s;hare in ready mo|ney, wrought &s;ilver, gold, and jewels, amounted to between 6 and 7000 l. &s;terling, which Cap|tain Clipperton cau&s;ed to be immediately put on board a Portugue&s;e Ea&s;t-Indiaman, called the Queen of Angels, Don Franci&s;co la Vero Com|mander, which &s;hip was unfortunately burnt at Rio Janeiro, on the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il, June 6, 1722. So that of the&s;e effects the owners received no more, the charges of &s;alvage deducted, than 1800.</P>
<P>On September 30, they weighed anchor from the bay of Amoy, which lies in the province of Tonkin, after having paid, under the article of port charges, the mo&s;t exorbitant &s;um of 1700 dollars; and then proceeded to Macao, in the road of which they anchored, Oct. 4. As &s;oon as Capt. Clipperton entered the port, he &s;aluted the fortre&s;s; which compliment being returned, he went on &s;hore, and found there the Captain of the Portugue&s;e man-of-war, who had undertaken to carry what belonged to the owners to Bra&s;il. The mutinous crew found them&s;elves at a lo&s;s
<PB N="125" REF="130">
here, the Portugue&s;e Captain declaring ab&s;olute|ly in favour of their Commander; and, there|fore, Captain Cook, and another officer, took pa&s;&s;age to Canton, to con&s;ult Mr. Winder, &s;u|percargo to an Ea&s;t-Indiaman, and &s;on to one of the principal proprietors, as to the mea&s;ures which &s;hould be taken about carrying the Suc|ce&s;s home; and, upon their return, the &s;hip was &s;urveyed, condemned, and &s;old for 4000 dollars: but Capt. Clipperton, to &s;hew his opinion of her, agreed with the per&s;ons who bought her, for his pa&s;&s;age in her to Batavia; a plain indication, that there was no danger of her foundering at &s;ea. The &s;hip being &s;old, every man thought him&s;elf at liberty to &s;hift as well as he could, and to u&s;e his be&s;t endeavour to &s;ave what little was left him. They were, by this time, &s;atisfied, that Captain Mitchell, his crew, and cargo, were all gone to the bottom, or el&s;e fallen into the hands of the Spaniards; which was to them pret|ty much the &s;ame thing; and, therefore, what they had now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was all they had to expect. Twenty of them, however, who had agreed to give &s;ix dollars a-piece for a pa&s;&s;age in a Chine&s;e ve&s;&s;el to Canton, were taken by a pirate, and mo&s;t of them lo&s;t all their effects. After a &s;hort &s;tay at Macao, Mr. Taylor, the chief mate, got &s;afe to Canton in an armed boat, for which he, and the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h &s;ea|men that &s;taid with him, paid 20 dollars a-head: and when they arrived, they were well received, and promi&s;ed all imaginable a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards
<PB N="126" REF="131">
getting home. There were, at this time, &s;everal &s;hips there ready to &s;ail. The Captains of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els being &s;olicited by the factory to take Captain Clipperton's men on board, they met, and agreed to carry them to Great Britain for five pounds a man; and accordingly they all paid their money. Mr. Taylor arrived &s;afely at Batavia in the month of December, &s;ailed from thence to the Cape of Good Hope in February, came to St. Helena in March, and, in May 1722, arrived in London. The re&s;t of the &s;hip's com|pany returned, &s;ome &s;ooner, &s;ome later, as op|portunities offered; but, as for Capt. Mitchell, who was &s;ent to Bra&s;il with a &s;mall crew, he was never heard of, and mo&s;t probably was de&s;troy|ed on the i&s;land of Velas, where he went a&s;hore for the &s;ake of getting fre&s;h provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Captain Clipperton &s;ailed in the Succe&s;s, after &s;he was &s;old, as a pa&s;&s;enger, from Macao to Ba|tavia; from whence he procured a pa&s;&s;age home in a Dutch Ea&s;t-India &s;hip, and arrived, in the beginning of July, 1722, at Galway, in Ireland, where he died in le&s;s than a week of a broken heart.</P>
<P>Thus ended the unfortunate voyage of Cap|tain Clipperton; that of Captain Shelvock re|mains to be related.</P>

<HEAD>THE VOYAGE OF CAPTAIN SHELVOCK ROUND THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already given an account, in the introduction to the preceding voyage, of the motives that influenced the owners to under|take it, and of the difficulties and di&s;courage|ments that attended the fir&s;t &s;etting out. It re|mains now only to relate the proceedings of Captain Shelvock, the &s;econd in command, who has him&s;elf been very circum&s;tantial in laying before the public the following particulars.</P>
<P>On the 13th of February, 1719, we &s;ailed from Plymouth, in company with the Succe&s;s, of 36 guns, Captain John Clipperton, who, in con&s;ideration of his knowledge of the coa&s;ts and cu&s;toms of Chili, Peru, and Mexico, was to act as chief of the expedition.</P>
<P>On the 15th, I came under his lee, complain|ed of the crankne&s;s of my &s;hip, and de&s;ired him to &s;end for his wine and brandy, which he neg|lecting, lo&s;t his &s;ea &s;tock of liquors; for we never &s;aw any thing of each other till about two years afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="133">Thur&s;day 19, a &s;torm aro&s;e, and about mid|night a &s;ea drove in our quarter and one of our &s;tern dead lights. For a con&s;iderable time we were under apprehen&s;ions of foundering; a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of prodigious &s;eas drove over us; and in this melancholy &s;tate, the chain pump was the only means of our deliverance.</P>
<P>February 20, we had no &s;ight of the Succe&s;s, and at midnight &s;et the top-&s;ails and &s;tood to the north-we&s;tward.</P>
<P>This &s;torm &s;o terrified my &s;hip's company, that no le&s;s than 70 of them were re&s;olved upon bearing away for England, there to make com|plaint again&s;t the &s;hip. But, on the 23d, per|ceiving their di&s;content, I ordered them all on deck, and u&s;ed what arguments with them I was ma&s;ter of, to encourage them to proceed; but all I could &s;ay was but to little purpo&s;e. They continued in their re&s;olution to clap the helm a <HI>weather</HI>; and grew to that height of in&s;olence at la&s;t, that I was obliged to call upon my officers to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing the mutineers to rea&s;on. For this end mo&s;t of them appeared armed; and the &s;ight of this &s;o &s;tartled the ringleaders, that they very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively begged I would forgive them; as I did, upon promi&s;e for the future to behave as became them. After this, &s;eeing them inclin|ed to be tractable, I ordered them &s;ome brandy, and they drank to our pro&s;perous voyage. But the very next evening, Simon Hatley, my &s;econd Captain, had like to have thrown every thing in|to confu&s;ion, by telling me upon deck, before
<PB N="129" REF="134">
mo&s;t of the &s;hip's company, that he had private orders from one of the chief of the gentlemen adventurers, and Captain Clipperton, to take the charge of the &s;hip upon him&s;elf. I a&s;ked him, if he had a private commi&s;&s;ion too? but to this he returned nothing but expre&s;&s;ions of contempt. This un&s;eamanlike behaviour, immediately after my &s;eparation from my con&s;ort, laid me under a nece&s;&s;ity of behaving with all po&s;&s;ible circum|&s;pection, to prevent our being divided into par|ties, which would infallibly fru&s;trate the ends of our expedition.</P>
<P>We had a very tedious pa&s;&s;age to our fir&s;t place of rendezvous, the Canary I&s;lands; and did not arrive there till the 17th of March, where having fini&s;hed our crui&s;e without any thing remarkable, except taking an open boat with &s;alt, and wine, hearing nothing of the Succe&s;s, on March the 29th, we took our departure from the i&s;land of Ferro, in hopes of meeting with Captain Clip|perton among the i&s;lands of Cape de Verd, and we took our prize along with us. But in our pa&s;&s;age, my people began again to murmur; and one Turner Stevens, my gunner, very gravely made a propo&s;al to me, in the hearing of all the other officers, to go a crui&s;ing in the Red Sea; for, &s;aid he, there can be no harm in robbing tho&s;e Mahometans; but, as for the poor Spaniards, continued he, they are good Chri&s;tians, and it would, doubtle&s;s, be a &s;in to injure them. Upon this, I ordered him under confinement; and the man, after that, having threatened, in a
<PB N="130" REF="135">
very outrageous manner, to blow up the &s;hip, I, at his own reque&s;t, di&s;charged him as &s;oon as we arrived, together with my chief mate, who had likewi&s;e been guilty of many and great mi&s;de|meanors.</P>
<P>On the 14th of April, we made the I&s;le of May; and, running along &s;hore, &s;aw a wreck, which we were told was the Vanzittern Indiaman, Cap|tain Hide, who three weeks before had been ca&s;t away. I endeavoured to avail my&s;elf of this ac|cident, to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;aries we &s;tood in need of; but could procure nothing but two or three &s;heathing-boards. At this place I &s;old our prize for 150 dollars to the Governor; and filled all our water ca&s;ks, and gave my &s;hip a very good heel. Six of my people having de&s;erted, I ap|plied in vain to the officer on &s;hore to deliver them up to me; but, threatening the Ma&s;ter of a Portugue&s;e &s;hip to make repri&s;als, he brought me off two of them, which happened to be the be&s;t. They fell on their knees, and a&s;ked par|don, a&s;&s;uring me the Commander on &s;hore had &s;educed them, his de&s;ign being to &s;end the bark I &s;old him on the Vanzittern's wreck, where he &s;aid they might all make their fortunes; &s;o I lo&s;t the other four.</P>
<P>Finding I could neither hear of the Succe&s;s, nor get what might be &s;erviceable to us in this place, and having read in Frezier's voyage, that in the i&s;land of St. Catherine's, on the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il, in latitude 27 deg. 30 min. S. every thing might be had that we &s;tood in need of, I
<PB N="131" REF="136">
concluded it would be be&s;t for me to put in there.</P>
<P>April 20, we &s;ailed from the I&s;le of May, having wrenched the drum-head of our cap|&s;tane in weighing anchor, which took us up the remainder of the day to repair. We were 55 days in going to St. Catherine's, during which little remarkable happened; except that on June the 5th we &s;aw a &s;hip &s;temming with us, and &s;poke with her. I ordered the five-oar'd boat to be hoi&s;ted out, and &s;ent Captain Hatley in her, to enquire after news, and gave him money to buy us tobacco. The Succe&s;s, among&s;t other things, had got our &s;tock of tobacco, and had made what the &s;eamen call a we&s;t-country famine on board of us. When Hatley returned, he told me &s;he was a Portugue&s;e from Rio Janeiro, and bound to Fernambuco. In&s;tead of tobacco, which he &s;aid the &s;hip had none to di&s;po&s;e of, he had laid out my money in china ware, &s;weet-meats, and the like; and, upon my expre&s;&s;ing my di&s;&s;atisfaction at his having &s;quandered away my money in &s;o &s;illy a manner, his an&s;wer was, that he had laid out his own in the &s;ame manner. My reply was, I did not like his proceedings.</P>
<P>On Friday, June 19, we made the i&s;land of St. Catherine's; and at ten the next morning anchored in ten fathom water, the i&s;land of Gall bearing E. N. E. di&s;tant two leagues, and the ea&s;termo&s;t point of St. Catherine's E. and by S. di&s;tant four leagues. The fir&s;t thing I did, was to &s;end the carpenter on &s;hore, with all the
<PB N="132" REF="137">
people that could be u&s;eful to him in felling of trees, and &s;awing them into plank, and to order the cooper and his crew to trim the ca&s;ks, and fill them with water. Tho&s;e who remained on board, I employed in different &s;ervices. Mean while the inhabitants came off to us every day with the product of the place, which we pur|cha&s;ed with &s;alt.</P>
<P>On July 2, we were alarmed, at break of day, by the appearance of a large &s;hip at anchor four or five miles below the place where we lay. I &s;ent an officer in the launch, well manned and armed, to &s;ee what he could make of her, and put my &s;hip into the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence I could. About noon my launch returned, and brought word that this &s;hip was the Ruby, for|merly an Engli&s;h man-of-war, and now one of M. Martinet's &s;quadron; that &s;he came from the South Seas, and was commanded by M. la Jon|quiere; that he, his officers, and &s;eamen, to the number of 420, were all French; and tho' in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice, they had not the lea&s;t de|&s;ign to mole&s;t us. My Lieutenant became thus punctually informed, by a direct breach of or|ders in going aboard, and his temerity might have co&s;t me very dear; for, had they been ene|mies, I &s;hould have lo&s;t 23 of my be&s;t hands; but their return confirmed the truth of his &s;tory: yet it was a great misfortune, that I had not, to the be&s;t of my knowledge, one man of expe|rience or capacity &s;ufficient to enable him to per|form the common duty of an officer.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="138">The next day, the Ruby turned up towards us, and the Captain &s;ent one of his lieutenants and a prie&s;t, to a&s;&s;ure me of his friend&s;hip, and to de&s;ire I would dine with him, which I did, and met with a very hand&s;ome reception, with offers of what money I would have upon my bills on London, or in general any thing el&s;e his &s;hip afforded. He informed me that the Spa|niards in the South Seas had advice of our two &s;hips, and that they talked of fitting out &s;ome men of war to receive us.</P>
<P>About this time there was a report &s;pread, that Hatley had taken a bribe of the Ma&s;ter of the Portugue&s;e we met on the 5th of June, or had robbed him of 80 or 100 moidores, had given ten to his cock&s;wain, and &s;ix to each of his boat's crew, not to divulge it. I charged him with what had been &s;aid again&s;t him; his an&s;wer was, He had done nothing he was a&s;ham|ed of, or that he could not ju&s;tify. All I could do was to prote&s;t again&s;t him, and I gave the prote&s;t to Captain Clipperton in the South Seas.</P>
<P>July 6, M. la Jonquiere, accompanied by &s;everal of his officers and pa&s;&s;engers, came to dine with me; but in the mid&s;t of our enter|tainment, my boat&s;wain took it into his head to create a di&s;turbance, becau&s;e he had not been invited into the cabbin as a gue&s;t. He fir&s;t a&s;|&s;aulted Betagh the Captain of marines, and then Mr. Adams the &s;urgeon. This outrage, which was &s;upported by a party he had formed, being, by the help of my officers and the French
<PB N="134" REF="139">
gentlemen, pretty well quieted, M. la Jonquiere declared, that, if they per&s;i&s;ted in their di&s;obe|dience, he would &s;ee the ringleaders puni&s;hed by carrying them home in irons; and as they grew a little quieter, he expo&s;tulated with them, and appealed to them&s;elves, whether they did not think it mon&s;trous for people to behave them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner.</P>
<P>The next morning I was informed, that the authors of the di&s;turbance were mo&s;t of them &s;orry for what had happened the night before, attributing the whole blame to the boat&s;wain, and the effect of too much liquor. I was glad to hear this, and therefore pa&s;&s;ed it all over with only threatening how I would manage them, if ever they were guilty of the like again. I had re&s;olved to puni&s;h the boat&s;wain in the &s;evere&s;t manner; but I was prevailed on not to do it, he, in very humble plight, a&s;king my pardon, and begging I would not u&s;e any &s;everity to|wards him. He &s;aid it was drink that had made him mad, and withal de&s;ired I would give him leave to go home in the French &s;hip. This I willingly agreed to, he being a very odd &s;ort of a fellow, and always incen&s;ing the people again&s;t the number of officers, whom he termed Blood|&s;uckers.</P>
<P>July 15, we &s;aw a great &s;hip plying into the harbour's mouth; but when &s;he di&s;covered us, &s;he made the be&s;t of her way out again. This po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed M. la Jonquiere with a notion of her being our con&s;ort, and put him into a hurry to
<PB N="135" REF="140">
be gone. Accordingly, when night came on, he weighed, and went to &s;ea the next morning, and at his departure &s;aluted me with five guns. Three Frenchmen, belonging to me, went away with him; but I had two Frenchmen, and one Morphew, an Iri&s;hman, in lieu of them.</P>
<P>During all this, our carpenter went on but &s;lowly in the woods; and at la&s;t, when we came to ca&s;e the &s;tern all over with thick plank, we could find, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment, no nails fit for that u&s;e. I was now told, that the fir&s;t carpenter, and his crew, had &s;old mo&s;t of the &s;tores before the &s;hip came to Plymouth, which was before I commanded her.</P>
<P>July 25, a large &s;hip came in, called the Wi&s;e Solomon, of St. Malo's of 40 guns, and about 160 men, commanded by M. Dumain Girard, and bound to the coa&s;ts of Chili and Peru to trade. She was the &s;ame &s;hip we &s;aw coming in before, and had &s;poke with the Ruby at &s;ea. This gentleman, I &s;oon perceived, notwith&s;tand|ing a little forced civility at his fir&s;t arrival, was a de&s;igning mercenary man, and full of all the conceit and vanity a&s;cribed to his nation.</P>
<P>De&s;iring him to &s;pare me &s;ome nails, he readi|ly an&s;wered he would; but, at the &s;ame time, gave me to under&s;tand that he could not afford them for le&s;s than 32 dollars a hundred, which &s;um I was fain to give him; I likewi&s;e bought of him 60 chee&s;es, and 300 weight of butter; &s;o that it happened well for me, that I had &s;ome money from one of the Ruby's people. This
<PB N="136" REF="141">
done, I now thought of making a quick di&s;|patch from this place, when there came a letter from my &s;hip's company to me, with articles an|nexed to it for the immediate divi&s;ion of prize-money, which they &s;aid they were re&s;olved to in|&s;i&s;t on, alledging that they knew by woeful ex|perience how they were u&s;ed on board the Duke and Dutche&s;s, that they were never paid one tenth of their due, and that they had been well informed what a payma&s;ter a certain gentleman would make, if ever their fortunes &s;hould fall into his hands. They were &s;o very importunate with me to comply with their articles, that both my&s;elf, and all my chief officers, thought it would be be&s;t and mo&s;t advi&s;eable to &s;ign their papers with them, rather than run the ri&s;que of their proceeding, when they &s;hould get out to &s;ea, to acts of piracy. As &s;oon as they had gained their point, they expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction, and promi&s;ed to be always ready to hazard their lives in any undertaking I &s;hould think condu|cive to the ends we were fitted out for.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 3, there came in here the St. Franci&s;co Xavier, a Portugue&s;e man-of-war, of 40 guns, and 300 men, from Li&s;bon, bound to Macao in China, commanded by Captain la Riviere, a Frenchman. I made no doubt but that Captain Hatley's affair would be reported to this gentle|man, and, therefore, I told Hatley, that I ex|pected he would go and vindicate him&s;elf to the Portugue&s;e Captain, to prevent any di&s;turbances
<PB N="137" REF="142">
that might ari&s;e on his account. To which he readily replied he would.</P>
<P>Hatley, at his return, told me, the Captain &s;eemed to be angry with him for thinking he could harbour any ill thought of a gentleman bound on a voyage, which, to his knowledge, could hardly fail of an&s;wering the large&s;t expec|tations.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 6, three of my men de&s;erted, and the mate and his party went up to the Portugue&s;e plantations in &s;earch of them. It being almo&s;t mid|night, the inhabitants took the alarm, and plant|ed them&s;elves in ambu&s;cade to de&s;troy them as they came back. No &s;ooner had they returned into the boat, than they heard them ru&s;hing out of the woods, crying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Kill the dogs, kill all the Engli&s;h dogs."</Q> This outery was in|&s;tantly followed by a volley of &s;mall arms, which wounded three of my men, two through the thigh, and another through the arm.</P>
<P>I &s;ent a letter of complaint, by Hatley, to the Captain of the Portugue&s;e man-of-war in the harbour: but Hatley, at his entrance into the &s;hip, was furiou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted by Emanuel Man&s;a (the Captain of the i&s;land), crying out, This was the man who had committed &s;o many in&s;olencies towards them, and that this was he who had burnt one of their hou&s;es, and had made it a common practice to abu&s;e and affront him with the op|probrious name of cuckold. Upon this excla|mation, the &s;hip's company &s;ided with Man&s;a, and fell upon Hatley, and would certainly have u&s;ed both him and his boat's crew very &s;everely,
<PB N="138" REF="143">
had not the Captain and his officers, with much difficulty, prevented it; for the Portugue&s;e &s;ea|men were exa&s;perated to that degree, that it is more than likely they would have murdered him, had they not been timely hindered.</P>
<P>The Captain, in his an&s;wer to my letter, ex|pre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow for what had happened, &s;aid the people were without law, and that it was out of his power to puni&s;h them; that they were wild and lurked in the woods; and that in &s;eeking revenge, it would only expo&s;e my men to butchery. He a&s;ked my pardon for the ill u&s;age my officer had met with on board his &s;hip; but withal gave me to under&s;tand, there could be no greater provocation to the people of that na|tion, than that which Hatley was accu&s;ed of by Man&s;a. That his &s;hip's company had got Hat|ley among&s;t them before he knew any thing of the matter, and that he was obliged to call his prie&s;t to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, before he could get him out of their hands, and in a very hand|&s;ome manner touched upon Hatley's &s;tory. I made no long &s;tay after this di&s;a&s;ter, but took our departure from the northernmo&s;t point of St. Catherine's on the 9th of Augu&s;t; and on the 19th, Mr. La Port, my third Lieutenant, broke his leg.</P>
<P>From the time we left St. Catherine's, till now, we had for the mo&s;t part &s;qually weather. As we advanced to the &s;outhward, my people's &s;tomachs increa&s;ed with the &s;harpne&s;s of the air to that degree, that the allowance which the go|vernment gives in the navy was not &s;ufficient to
<PB N="139" REF="144">
&s;atisfy their hunger. Some of my officers, in particular Mr. Betagh, my Captain of marines, who had been formerly a pur&s;er of a man-of-war, and a man whom I had a great regard for, was the champion for an addition of allowance at my table; for he told me he had orders from the adventurers to eat with me; and what was my table, if I did not eat better than the cook? He did not &s;top here, but urged by his intemperance, and finding me unwilling to &s;quander away our provi&s;ions, without knowing when or where we might get any more, he at length had the in&s;o|&s;ence to tell me publicly, that the voyage &s;hould be &s;hort with me, which he often repeat|ed. I &s;hould have had rea&s;on to fear it, had he been capable of commanding; but, for his pu|ni&s;hment, I excluded him both from my me&s;s and the great cabbin. Upon this, finding I was in earne&s;t with him, and fearing &s;ome heavier pu|ni&s;hment, he &s;ent me a letter, a&s;king my pardon for what he had done; upon which I again re|&s;tored him in a hand&s;omer manner than he after|wards de&s;erved, as will appear by the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Between St. Catherine's and the river of Plate, the whales, grampu&s;&s;es, and other fi&s;h of mon|&s;trous bulk, are in &s;uch numbers, that I cannot &s;ee why a trade for blubber might not be carried on here. I may venture to affirm, it is a &s;afer navigation than that carried on to the northward, and I am apt to believe here is a greater certainty of &s;ucce&s;s in making up a cargo.</P>
<P>Sept 19, about midnight I perceived the wa|ter to be di&s;coloured all at once, and upon heav|ing
<PB N="140" REF="145">
the lead, we found our&s;elves in 26 fathom water; this done, I &s;tood off again to &s;ea, but we did not deepen our water in the running of five leagues. This &s;eems to be a bank very near the entrance of the &s;traits of Magellan. I had a fine opportunity of going through the&s;e &s;traits: but Captain Clipperton in his plan pretended, out of the abundance of his judgment and expe|rience, that the &s;traits of Le Mair would be the be&s;t navigation for us, though he him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;traits of Magellan. From this I might have conjectured, that he, who never was fond of having a con&s;ort with him, de&s;igned to make u&s;e of this as a likely expedient to &s;epa|rate him&s;elf; for he was a man that would do any thing, though ever &s;o di&s;hone&s;t or inhuman;&mdash;[a reflection, however, that carries more of ma|lice than of truth on the face of it.]</P>
<P>Sept. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">, the fog clearing up, we had a full, but melancholy pro&s;pect, of the mo&s;t de&s;olate country that can be conceived, &s;eeming no other than continued ridges and chains of mountains, one within another, perpetually buried in &s;now. Towards noon we were becalmed within three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">gues of the mountains called the Three Bro|thers, &s;o named from their equal height, near re&s;emblance, and proximity to one another. Till now, we had not been &s;en&s;ible of any helps or hin|drances by currents; but this afternoon we were hurried with incredible rapidity into the &s;traits, and ju&s;t as we had gained &s;omewhat more than the mid-pa&s;&s;age, the northern tide came ru&s;hing
<PB N="141" REF="146">
upon us with a violence equal to that of the tide which had brought us in, and, to our great a&s;to|ni&s;hment, drove us out of the &s;traits again at a great and extraordinary rate, notwith&s;tanding we had a fre&s;h and fair gale with us at N. W. Upon the &s;hifting of this tide to windward, there aro&s;e &s;uch a &s;hort, and, while it la&s;ted, &s;o hollow a &s;ea, and &s;o lofty withal, that we alternately dipped our bow&s;prit end, and poop lanthorns, into the wa|ter. Our &s;hip laboured in the mo&s;t alarming manner, and became in&s;en&s;ible of the guidance of her helm; but at midnight the tide &s;hifted, and we put through the &s;traits without &s;eeing the land on either &s;ide, and in the morning had a very good offing to the &s;outhward. We had found it very cold before we came this length, but now we began to feel the extreme of it. The bleak we&s;terly winds of them&s;elves would have been &s;ufficiently piercing, but they were always attended with drifts either of &s;now or &s;leet, which, continually beating on our &s;ails and rigging, ca&s;ed the ma&s;ts and every rope with ice, &s;o that there was no handling them. It was common with us to be two or three days together lying to under bare poles, expo&s;ed all the while to the a&s;&s;aults of prodigious &s;eas, much larger than any I had ever ob&s;erved before. The winds reign|ing thus tempe&s;tuou&s;ly, without intermi&s;&s;ion, in the we&s;tern board, we had &s;tretched away into lat. 61 deg. 30 min. S. where we were in con|tinual dread of falling foul of i&s;lands of ice, and
<PB N="142" REF="147">
where we found the variation to be 22 deg. 6 min. to the north-ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>October 1, as we were furling the main-&s;ail, one William Camell cried out, that his hands were &s;o benumbed, he could not hold him&s;elf; but before tho&s;e who were next to him could lay hold of him, he fell into the &s;ea, and the &s;hip making fre&s;h way, and the &s;ea running high, we lo&s;t &s;ight of him before we could bring to. In|deed, one would imagine it impo&s;&s;ible that any thing could live in &s;o rigid a climate; and, truly, we &s;aw neither fi&s;h nor bird, except one &s;oli|tary albitro&s;s, which accompanied us for &s;eve|ral days, and hovered about us, till Hatley con|cluding, in a gloomy fit, that the company of this melancholy bird brought us ill luck, re&s;olv|ed to de&s;troy him, in hopes we might then have better weather.</P>
<P>October 22, at eight at night, we carried away our fore-top-ma&s;t, and rigged another next morning. We crept by very &s;low degrees, after we had ventured to tack and &s;tand to the north|ward, in hopes to weather our way into the Great South Seas; and indeed it may be averred, that from the time we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traits of Le Mair, till we had the fir&s;t &s;ight of the coa&s;t of Chili, we had been continually di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the winds, and di&s;couraged by bad weather.</P>
<P>Nov. 14, we &s;aw the coa&s;t of Chili, di&s;tant 10 leagues, lat. by ob&s;ervation 47 deg. 28 min. S.</P>
<P>Being now arrived on the confines of the Spa|ni&s;h &s;ettlements, we found our&s;elves under an
<PB N="143" REF="148">
ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of contriving &s;ome means by which we might recruit our wood and water. We had but &s;even buts of water remaining, and a much le&s;s proportion of wood. I thought it would be be&s;t for us to go fir&s;t to Narborough's i&s;land, and accordingly directed our cour&s;e to that place.</P>
<P>Nov. 21, at &s;even in the morning, we had &s;oundings in 28 fathom water, of fine grey and black &s;and. But here we found a wild road, which could not be deemed fafe for us&mdash;[Here Capt. Shelvock laments it as a great misfortune, that he could not reach Juan Fernandez, in la|titude 33 deg. 30 min. S. without &s;topping: tho' at the &s;ame time it is plain, that he lo&s;t more time in &s;earching for a nearer place of re|fre&s;hment, than the direct pa&s;&s;age to that i&s;land would have taken him up. But the imputation he would throw upon Clipperton is applicable only to him&s;elf: he never intended to act under him; and all his excu&s;es are mere &s;hifts.]</P>
<P>Surrounded with doubts and apprehen&s;ions, &s;ays he, le&s;t we &s;hould be obliged to advance too far on the&s;e coa&s;ts, without a competent &s;tock of provi&s;ions, one Jo&s;eph de la Fontaine, a French|man, a&s;&s;ured me, that, if I would go to the i&s;land of Chiloe, which was at that time a little to the northward of us, there was no place for our pur|po&s;e like it in all the South Seas; that the towns of Chacao and Calibuco, the fir&s;t on the i&s;land it&s;elf, and the &s;econd on the continent, were rich
<PB N="144" REF="149">
places; that the former was the u&s;ual place of re&s;idence of the Governor, and that at the latter there was a wealthy college of Je&s;uits; and that there were con&s;iderable magazines kept up, which were always well &s;tocked with provi&s;ions of all kinds.</P>
<P>On the&s;e con&s;iderations I formed a re&s;olution of going to Chiloe; and on the 30th of Novem|ber we entered the channel, with an intent to &s;urprize and attack the towns of Chacao and Ca|libuco: but, immediately after we had come to, the windward tide made out with prodigious ra|pidity, which in&s;tantly cau&s;ed a great &s;ea; and the wind increa&s;ing at the &s;ame time, the chan|nel all about us appeared like one continued breach. In the mid&s;t of this our &s;hip laid a great &s;train upon her cable, which unfortunately part|ed, and we lo&s;t our anchor. We pa&s;&s;ed by two commodious bays; and, at length, we rounded a point of land out of the tide's way, where we were commodiou&s;ly &s;heltered from all inconveni|ences; and, the next morning, I &s;ent my &s;econd Lieutenant to make a di&s;covery of the towns of Chacao and Calibuco, and, at the &s;ame time, Captain Hatley, to find out a watering place for us. He &s;oon returned again, and brought with him an Indian, who gave us hopes of a &s;ufficient &s;upply of all we wanted, but afterwards came in the evening to tell us, the country was forbidden to &s;upply us with any thing The Lieutenant not being yet returned, this information made me
<PB N="145" REF="150">
apprehend the enemy had taken him, and by that means had learned who we were.</P>
<P>December 3, there came to us a Spani&s;h offi|cer, in a piragua rowed by eight Indians, who was &s;ent by the Governor to be informed who we were. As &s;oon as we had a &s;ight of the piragua, I hoi&s;ted French colours, and, when the Spaniard came on board, I told him, we were a homeward-bound French &s;hip, called the St. Ro&s;e, and that my name was le Janis le Breton. Under this notion he &s;taid with us all. night, and next morning departed, not &s;eeming to &s;u&s;pect us. I wrote to the Governor by this gentleman, &s;ignifying that I wanted a &s;upply of provi&s;ions to carry me back to France, de&s;iring him to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in what he could; and received for an&s;wer a complaint again&s;t the violences of our men, in killing their &s;heep, and driving away their cattle, by which I knew that they had &s;een my Lieutenant. But I was in de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing him, or the people who were with him, any more. I therefore &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Governor, that provi&s;ions I wanted, and provi|&s;ions I mu&s;t have, and that very &s;peedily; and that all the forces of Chacao, Calibuco, Carel|mapo, or Ca&s;tro, &s;hould not frighten or deter me from &s;upplying my&s;elf. Soon after, there came a piragua with a me&s;&s;age, &s;ignifying, that if I would &s;end an officer to Chacao, he would treat with me. But I gave him for an&s;wer, that I would treat no where but on board my own &s;hip; and farther, that it was now too late, &s;ince
<PB N="146" REF="151">
I had already di&s;patched 80 men to take all they could find.</P>
<P>Soon after the pinnace arrived, which I had &s;o long given over for lo&s;t, with all her crew; but they were &s;o terrified, that I had no hopes of their being fit for &s;ervice in any rea&s;onable time. The officer had no excu&s;e for not return|ing as &s;oon as he had got a &s;ight of the town, but that the tide hurried him away at unawares, and that in the fright he had forgot he had a graplin in the boat to come to with, till the tide had &s;hifted. I &s;aid but little to him; and only made the officer &s;en&s;ible of his mi&s;management, which had been the ruin of the advantageous views I might have had, in taking either Chacao or Calibuco.</P>
<P>December 16, we had now our decks full of live cattle, &s;uch as European &s;heep, hogs, gua|nicces, poultry in abundance, and hams, &amp;c. as al&s;o a good quantity of wheat, barley, pota|toes, maize, or Indian corn; and, in &s;hort, I com|puted that I had added four months provi&s;ions to what remained of our Engli&s;h &s;tock, and that without the lea&s;t hindrance or mole&s;tation from the enemy.</P>
<P>December 17, we began to unmoor, and at noon we weighed, and &s;ailed out with the wind at W. S. W. The night before we departed, one of our men made his e&s;cape into the woods. It was beyond all di&s;pute that this fellow would give a full account of us. This, added to the ill conduct of my Lieutenant, together with the
<PB N="147" REF="152">
contrary execution of all my orders, by tho&s;e officers whom I had hitherto entru&s;ted in affairs of importance, made me de&s;pair of ever having any thing done to the purpo&s;e; and on this oc|ca&s;ion, I could not forbear reflecting on the mi&s;|management of &s;ome gentlemen in England, who blindly made u&s;e of their intere&s;t to prefer per|&s;ons to po&s;ts for which they were utterly unfit.</P>
<P>I &s;ailed from Chiloe with a de&s;ign to go &s;traight to the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, but was prevented by my people, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with notions of va&s;t advantages to be made by going to the port of Conception. It was our Frenchman, who had been &s;o in&s;trumental in our Chiloenian attempt, who was the cau&s;e of this. Finding his accounts hitherto tolerably ju&s;t, they once more li&s;tened to him; and every one of my &s;hip's company, who could &s;ay any thing at this juncture, did not fail to &s;peak his mind &s;ome|what in&s;olently; particularly William Morphew, one of the men I had out of the Ruby, and who had been in the&s;e &s;eas &s;everal years, took upon him to tell me, that it could not &s;ignify much whether we arrived two or three days &s;ooner or later at Juan Fernandez; that I was a &s;tranger here, but that the Frenchman and him&s;elf were &s;o well acquainted with the&s;e &s;eas, that every body hoped I would be advi&s;ed and go to Con|ception, and not put a mere punctilio to orders in the balance again&s;t a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, if we were &s;o happy as to arrive at that port in time. Con&s;idering now how ea&s;ily they might be
<PB N="148" REF="153">
brought to throw off command, and how little I &s;hould be able to help my&s;elf, alone, as I might be &s;aid to be, if they came to that ex|tremity, I complied with them, and re&s;olved to &s;pend two or three days in going to Concep|tion; and, on December the 23d, we came abrea&s;t of the Teats of Bio Bio, and in the even|ing arrived in the bay, from whence I ordered the boats, well manned and armed, to go up in the night to &s;urprize what &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els might be in the harbour, and to make what ob&s;ervations they could concerning the place.</P>
<P>About noon, Captain Hatley returned in the pinnace, and informed me he had taken the So|lidad d'Anday, of 150 tons, the only &s;hip in the road or port, lately come from Baldivia, laden with timber; had no body on board except the boat&s;wain, an old negroe, and two Indian boys. He took al&s;o a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el of about 25 tons, near the i&s;land of Quiriquine, which belonged to a prie&s;t who had been gathering fruits, and was now made a pri&s;oner in her, together with four or five Indians. This ve&s;&s;el we found very u&s;eful, and called her the Mercury, being well built, and ready upon all occa&s;ions to look into port. There was another &s;mall ve&s;&s;el that pa&s;&s;ed within pi&s;tol-&s;hot, but Capt. Hatley never once offered to follow her, or bring her to. Hatley, truly, &s;aid, he did not mind her, though his boat's crew all agreed &s;he was full of men. This ve&s;&s;el was bringing advice of us from Chiloe. I
<PB N="149" REF="154">
did not fail to reprimand him for this, but to what effect!</P>
<P>Dec. 26, the prie&s;t being very &s;olicitous to ran&s;om his bark, he left my &s;hip in the morning, and, in my pinnace rowed by Indians, went a&s;hore to get money for that purpo&s;e. At noon, Mr. Brooks, fir&s;t Lieutenant, brought down the &s;hip we had taken, and anchored her about half a mile &s;hort of us. The boat&s;wain of her had not been on board above two hours before he gave me in|formation of a ve&s;&s;el laden with wine, brandy, and other valuable things, bound to the i&s;land of Chiloe, lying at anchor in the bay of Herradura, about two leagues to the northward of us. Thi|ther I ordered Mr. Randall, our &s;econd Lieu|tenant, with the boat&s;wain of the Solidad, and 25 men, to go; with po&s;itive orders not to &s;et a foot on &s;hore, or make any hazardous attempt whatever. But the next evening they returned with a di&s;mal &s;tory, that they went into the bay, and finding the ve&s;&s;el hauled dry on &s;hore, the officer ordered his people to land, and bring a|way what they could out of her; but their ca|reer was &s;oon &s;topped; for they had no &s;ooner got upon the bank, than they di&s;covered the enemy ru&s;hing out furiou&s;ly upon them. They all e&s;caped except five, who were overtaken in &s;hoal water, and they all agreed that tho&s;e five were cut to pieces. The Spaniards came down upon them, preceded by 20 or 30 hor&s;es a-brea&s;t, linked to each other. The&s;e were two deep; then came the enemy, mounted, and lying upon
<PB N="150" REF="155">
their hor&s;es necks, driving the others before them. They were not once &s;een to &s;it upright in their &s;addles, except when there was no danger, or to fire their mu&s;quets. This new addition to our misfortunes quite di&s;pirited the greate&s;t part of my &s;hip's company. Nothing was now heard but murmuring, and damning the South Seas, and declaring that, if this was making their for|tune, they had better have &s;taid at home and begged about the &s;treets; but ju&s;t as I was ex|po&s;tulating with Mr. Randall, who conducted this unfortunate undertaking, I was agreeably &s;urprized with the &s;ight of a large &s;hip, which we &s;aw coming about the northernmo&s;t point of the i&s;land of Quiriquine. It was almo&s;t dark, and &s;he could not perceive what we were, &s;o that &s;he &s;tood towards us without fear. As &s;oon as &s;he approached near enough, I hailed her, to which &s;he returned no an&s;wer, and I fired into her. This was no &s;ooner done, than &s;he came to, and called for quarter. She was called the St. Fermin, came from Callao, burthen about 300 tons, and laden with &s;ugar, mela&s;&s;es, rice, coar&s;e French linnen, and &s;ome cloths of Quito, together with a &s;mall quantity of chocolate, and about 5 or 6000 dollars in money and wrought plate. I &s;ent Mr. Hendry (the agent for prizes) to in&s;pect her lading, and to order every thing he could find valuable out of her, and the &s;hip's company &s;ent their agent likewi&s;e. In the after|noon they returned, and brought all the bales, boxes, che&s;ts, portmanteaus, &amp;c. that were in
<PB N="151" REF="156">
her; and al&s;o all the rice, with a large quantity of &s;ugar, mela&s;&s;es, and chocolate, and about 7000 weight of good ru&s;k, with all her eatables, and &s;tores.</P>
<P>Don Franci&s;co Larrayn, her Captain, de&s;ired to ran&s;om his &s;hip, to which I willingly con&s;ent|ed, and &s;uffered him to go in his own launch to rai&s;e money for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Dec. 30, there came a boat with an officer and a flag of truce, who brought word, that three only of our people in the &s;kirmi&s;h at Har|radura were killed, the other two wounded, and in a fair way of recovery, and that the boat had brought advice of us, as I &s;u&s;pected, from that i&s;land. The officer brought me &s;even jars of very good wine, a pre&s;ent from the Governor, and a letter full of civility, but written with a great deal of craft. He de&s;ired to &s;ee my com|mi&s;&s;ion, and then he would treat with me ac|cording to the laws of arms.</P>
<P>January 1, Captain Betagh went to Concep|tion with a copy of my commi&s;&s;ion, the declara|tion of war, &amp;c. and &s;oon after he returned with a Flemi&s;h je&s;uit, a Spani&s;h lawyer, and an Engli&s;h|man and a Scotchman. The je&s;uit a&s;&s;ured me he was only come to pay his re&s;pects to me, and to do his utmo&s;t to promote the affair of the ran&s;om, and bring it to an immediate conclu&s;ion. Therefore the fir&s;t thing I did, was to &s;hew my commi&s;&s;ion to the Engli&s;hman, who read it in Spani&s;h. The je&s;uit then told me, that the Cap|tains of the St. Fermin and Solidad had re|&s;olved
<PB N="152" REF="157">
to give me 12,000 dollars for the ran&s;om of both the &s;hips, and the Mercury included, in&s;tead of 16000 dollars which I had in&s;i&s;ted on for the St. Fermin only. To this I po&s;itively an&s;wered, that all their per&s;ua&s;ions, artifices, and pretences, &s;hould never make me agree with them. We had taken in the St. Fermin, ten large &s;ilver candle&s;ticks, each of them weighing above twenty-five pounds &s;terling. The holy father, in a &s;uppliant manner, repre&s;ented to me that they were a legacy to his convent, and hop|ed I would make no di&s;pute of &s;o noble a charity as it would be to put them into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e for whom they were de&s;igned. I offer|ed to let him have them for their weight in dol|lars, which, con&s;idering the great price they pay in tho&s;e parts for the fa&s;hion of wrought plate, was a very advantageous offer. But he &s;aid they never bought any thing for &s;acred u&s;es; and that, as the workmen put a great deal of al|lay into plate, it would be difficult to determine the different values of the dollars and the candle|&s;ticks; &s;o, after a deal of needle&s;s di&s;pute and entreaties, both about this, and the ran&s;om of the &s;hips, the je&s;uit and the re&s;t affirming that the Captains of the St. Fermin, &amp;c. were not able to rai&s;e above 12,000 dollars, there was nothing done.</P>
<P>Two days pa&s;&s;ing without news from the Go|vernor, I began to be certainly convinced they had &s;omething el&s;e in view more than the accom|modation of the ran&s;oms; but on January the
<PB N="153" REF="158">
4th, my two wounded men came on board, and with them brought a letter, importing, that, as he had now &s;ent back the pri&s;oners, he hoped no difficulty would remain to prevent my &s;end|ing on &s;hore all the pri&s;oners belonging to him.</P>
<P>January 6, the morning pa&s;&s;ed away without any news from the town. I now began to make preparations for &s;ailing, and in tho&s;e preparations &s;pent the greate&s;t part of the day. There being no appearance of any boat coming off to us, I ordered the St. Fermin to be &s;et on fire. Her cotton &s;ails being loo&s;ed, made a prodigious blaze. I had already &s;et fire to the Solidad, to quicken their motions; and now, having con|cluded the treaty, I immediately got under &s;ail, much chagrined at the lo&s;s of &s;o many days without reaping any advantage. I was afterwards informed, that, if they had thought I would have de&s;troyed the St. Fermin, they would have given even 20 or 30,000 dollars to have &s;aved her; for &s;he was one of the be&s;t &s;ailers and the be&s;t fitted out &s;hip of any of the Peruvian traders. I now directed our cour&s;e to the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, taking the Mercury with us.</P>
<P>January 8, the &s;ea was all day perfectly red, appearing as if va&s;t quantities of blood had been thrown into it, and curdled by the water. This, the Spaniards &s;ay, is occa&s;ioned by the &s;pawn of prawns, which mu&s;t certainly be a mi&s;take. In our pa&s;&s;age, the plunder was &s;old before the ma&s;t, by the &s;hip's company's agent, at very extrava|gant
<PB N="154" REF="159">
prices. At the &s;ame time the account of every thing being taken, and the value of the &s;hares calculated, the &s;hip's company de&s;ired me to let them have their dividend, according to the articles at St. Catherine's, which reque&s;t I could not with&s;tand. The prize-money and plunder amounting to ten pieces of eight per &s;hare, was thereupon di&s;tributed; and all the bales of coar&s;e cloth, bays, linnen, ribbons, lace, &s;ilk, and &s;everal other &s;orts of mercery wares, were equally divided, half to the owners, and half to the &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>Jan. 11, at &s;ix in the morning, we &s;aw the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, and from that day till the 15th I kept &s;tanding off and on the &s;hore for my boats, which were a fi&s;hing, who not having hitherto di&s;covered any marks whereby we might conclude that Clipperton had been here, I thought it proper to render my coming hither &s;erviceable in &s;ome re&s;pect, and therefore &s;ent the Mercury on &s;hore to &s;top her leaks, while the boats continued catching fi&s;h, of which we &s;alted as much as filled five puncheons. At length, going on &s;hore to make a nicer &s;earch, &s;ome of my men accidentally &s;aw the word MAGEE, which was the name of Clipperton's &s;urgeon, and CAPT. JOHN cut out under it up|on a tree, but no directions left, as was agreed on by him in his in&s;tructions to me. His actions being thus gro&s;ly repugnant to his in&s;tructions, it was evident he never meant I &s;hould keep him company, or ever join with him again,&mdash;[This
<PB N="155" REF="160">
reflection may with great ju&s;tice be retorted on the writer him&s;elf, and can in no &s;hape affect Clipperton who followed his in&s;tructions in the mo&s;t &s;crupulous manner.]&mdash;However, being by this confirmed in the certainty of Clipperton's arrival, I directly made the be&s;t of my way, and &s;ailed to the northward.</P>
<P>Jan. 21, having a de&s;ign to look into Copiapo as I went along &s;hore, I &s;ent Mr. Dodd, &s;econd Lieutenant of Marines, with eight men, as a rein|forcement to the Mercury's crew, and the next evening they left us &s;teering in for the land, whil&s;t I kept a proper offing, to prevent our being di&s;covered. The next day the officer re|turned and told me, he had looked into the port, but could &s;ee no &s;hipping there, upon which I made him &s;en&s;ible of his error, and &s;ent him to the right place, which was about &s;ix leagues to the northward of us, and ordered him to be ready to look into Caldera by day-light the next morning. They did &s;o, and &s;aw nothing; but, in&s;tead of making u&s;e of the land wind to come off to me, they kept along &s;hore, till the &s;ea breeze came on, and could not come to me till the morning after, by which means they hinder|ed me almo&s;t a whole day and night's &s;ailing; and in this vexatious manner were my orders al|ways executed!</P>
<P>Feb. 5th, I di&s;patched Mr. Brooks a-head to di&s;cover if there were any &s;hipping at Arica, and next day, I had a &s;ight of the head land of A|rica, and the i&s;land of Guano, with a &s;hip at an|chor
<PB N="156" REF="161">
on the northern &s;ide of it, and &s;aw the Mercury &s;tanding out of the bay, by which I judged the &s;hip was too warm for her, and there|fore made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to get up to her with our &s;hip. When I came into the port, I found her already taken, and that the Mercury only went accidentally adrift. This prize was called the Ro&s;ario, of about 100 tons, laden with cor|morants dung, which the Spaniards call guana, and is brought from the i&s;land of Iquique, for the culture of the agi, or cod-pepper, in the vale of Arica. There was no white face in her but the pilot, whom I &s;ent to &s;ee if her owner would ran&s;om her. At &s;even o'clock in the morn|ing I received a letter from the owner, expre&s;|&s;ing his poverty, and declaring his readine&s;s to comply to the utmo&s;t of his power: and the ho|ne&s;t man was as good as his word.</P>
<P>I agreed upon re&s;toring to him his &s;hip, and &s;ix negroes, for 1500 pieces of eight; and he was &s;o punctual and expeditious, that at 10 the next night he brought the &s;um agreed on. Soon after the receipt of this, we took a ve&s;&s;el of about 10 tons, as &s;he was coming into the road, with a cargo of dried fi&s;h and guana, within a mile of the town. The ma&s;ter of this bark likewi&s;e came off upon a bal&s;e, which is an odd &s;ort of an em|barkation, made of two large &s;eal-&s;kins &s;eparate|ly blown up like bladders, and then made fa&s;t and joined together by a frame of wood. On this he brought off two jars of brandy, and 40 pieces of eight, for his ran&s;om, which, con&s;ider|ing
<PB N="157" REF="162">
his mean appearance, was as much as I could have expected. One part of his freight was va|luable, which was his dried fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Feb. 9, 1720, I &s;ailed from Arica, and as I went out, the inhabitants placed them&s;elves round the bay, and made a very good hedge fire after me for about half an hour. I judged there could not be le&s;s than 5 or 600 of them. I &s;haped my cour&s;e for the road of Hilo, which we had a &s;ight of the next day at three in the afternoon, where we &s;aw one large &s;hip and three &s;mall ones at anchor. The great &s;hip imme|diately hoi&s;ted French colours, and in the end proved to be the Sage Solomon, of 40 guns, com|manded by Mon&s;. Dumain, whom I had left at St. Catherine's, and who was now re&s;olved to pro|tect the ve&s;&s;els that were with him, and ob&s;truct my coming in. I at fir&s;t thought of &s;hewing my re&s;entment, but, upon &s;econd thoughts, I clap|ped the helm a-weather, and &s;tood out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>Feb. 12, in the morning, the &s;hip's company had their moiety of the money taken at Arica divided among&s;t them, according to their num|ber of &s;hares.</P>
<P>Feb. 22, I came a-brea&s;t of Callao, the port for Lima, which is the metropolis of Peru; but there being no great pro&s;pect of performing much here in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I had nothing to do but to &s;lip away from hence in the night, by the help of a favourable breeze.</P>
<P>Feb. 26, the officers in the Mercury de&s;ired to be relieved, and it being Capt. Hatley's turn
<PB N="158" REF="163">
to go in her, he propo&s;ed to me that he might continue along &s;hore, till we had got the length of Lobos, an i&s;land in about &s;even degrees of &s;outh latitude. I could not but approve of this, con&s;idering the probability there was of his meeting with the Panama &s;hips; and every body being well plea&s;ed, I added to their complement of men, and gave them a month's provi&s;ions, and mounted two of our quarter-deck guns on the Mercury, and lent Captain Hatley my pinnace. As &s;oon as every thing was ready for their de|parture, Captain Betagh, who&s;e duty and turn it was to relieve the marine officer in the Mercury, being unwilling to go on this party, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the people, and with a fearful counte|nance told them, that he, and the re&s;t who were to go with him, were &s;ent for a &s;acrifice, with many other expre&s;&s;ions tending to create a gene|ral mutiny. I now imagined no le&s;s than that he was about to act what he had threatened when he told me, it &s;hould be a &s;hort voyage with me; and, therefore, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the &s;hip's company, de&s;ired to know who among&s;t them were of Betagh's opinion? Their an&s;wer was with one voice, None. This done, I ordered the Mercury along&s;ide, and Hatley and Betagh went on board of her; and, putting off from us, gave three cheers, and &s;tood right in for the land, in the latitude by ob&s;ervation of 10 deg. 9 min S.</P>
<P>The very next day they took a &s;mall bark la|den with rice, chocolate, wheat, flour, and the
<PB N="159" REF="164">
like. The day following they took another. On the fourth day of their ab&s;ence they be|came ma&s;ters of a &s;hip of near 200 tons, worth 150,000 pieces of eight. Flu&s;hed with this &s;uc|ce&s;s, it &s;eems Betagh prevailed on Hatley, and the greate&s;t part of the people with them, to lay hold of this opportunity and go to India: but they no &s;ooner clapped their helm a-weather, than they &s;aw a &s;ail &s;tanding towards them, which, in &s;hort, proved to be a Spani&s;h man-of-war, who caught them, and put an end to their Indian voyage. The Engli&s;h were treated very indifferently; but Betagh, it &s;eems, who was of their religion, and of a nation which the Spa|niards affect to be fond of, was made an officer, and u&s;ed very re&s;pectfully. This he certainly de&s;erved at their hands; for he gave them an account of the whole &s;cheme of our voyage; and not only informed them of what we had done, but al&s;o of what I de&s;igned to do; &s;o that they did not doubt but I my&s;elf &s;hould be in their hands very &s;peedily.</P>
<P>Feb. 29, at &s;ix in the morning, we &s;aw a &s;ail at anchor in the road of Guanchaco; at eleven we came up, and anchored along &s;ide of her. There was no body on board of her but two Indiamen and a boy. They informed us, there was a rich &s;hip in the cove of Payta.</P>
<P>March 21, at three in the afternoon, we &s;aw the Pena Oradado, or the <HI>Hole in the Rock</HI>; and in an hour afterwards, we entered the cove of Payta with French colours flying. There we
<PB N="160" REF="165">
found only a &s;mall &s;hip at anchor with her fore|ma&s;t out, and her main-top-ma&s;t unrigged; but the taking of this town being con&s;idered in the &s;cheme of our voyage as a matter of great im|portance, I con&s;ulted with my officers concern|ing the propere&s;t methods of going about it. At two of the clock the next morning I landed with 46 men, leaving Mr. Cold&s;ea the ma&s;ter, and &s;ome others, to bring the &s;hip nearer in, that we might the more expeditiou&s;ly embark the plunder we might get. Being now on &s;hore, I marched up to the great church without meet|ing any oppo&s;ition; and indeed I found the town entirely de&s;erted by the inhabitants. At day|light we &s;aw what &s;eemed great bodies of men on the hills, on each &s;ide of us, who, I expected, when they had viewed our &s;trength, would have paid us a vi&s;it; but I found, that as we marched up towards them, we drove them before us. The remainder of the day was &s;pent in &s;hipping off what plunder we had got, which con&s;i&s;ted of hogs, fowls, brown and white calavances, beans, Indian corn, wheat, flour, &s;ugar, and as much cocoa-nut as we were able to &s;tow away, with pans, and other conveniences for preparing it; &s;o that we were &s;upplied with breakfa&s;t-meat for the whole voyage, and full of provi&s;ions of one kind or other. In the afternoon there came to us a me&s;&s;enger, to know what I would take for the ran&s;om of the town and &s;hip; to which I an&s;wered, I would have 10,000 pieces of eight, and tho&s;e to be paid in twenty-four hours, if they
<PB N="161" REF="166">
intended to &s;ave the town, or &s;hip either. But the Governor gave me to under&s;tand in plain terms, that he neither could nor would ran&s;om the town, and did not care what I did with it, &s;o that I &s;pared the churches. Having received this negative an&s;wer, and got every thing &s;er|viceable out of the town, I in&s;tantly ordered it to be &s;et on fire; and the hou&s;es, being ex|tremely dry, con&s;umed away a-pace. But no &s;ooner was Payta in a blaze than tho&s;e on board made &s;ignals for me to come off, and kept in|ce&s;&s;antly firing towards the mouth of the har|bour. Upon which I ordered all hands off, and went fir&s;t on board my&s;elf in a canoe, with three men only; but, before I had got half way, &s;aw a large &s;hip lying with her fore-top &s;ail aback, and with a Spani&s;h flag flying at her fore-top-ma&s;t-head. At this pro&s;pect two of my three people were ready to &s;ink; and when I looked back on the town, I could not forbear wi&s;hing that I had not been &s;o ha&s;ty. As the Admiral was coming in with all his &s;ails &s;pread, Mr. Cold&s;ea, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the few on board, fired at him &s;o &s;martly, that he &s;topped the ene|my's career. The Spaniard apprehending he &s;hould have hot work with us, brought his &s;hip to, that he might put him&s;elf into a condition of making a vigorous attack upon us. This in|activity of the enemy gave me an opportunity of getting on board, and &s;uffered my men to come off, about 50 in number, but the Spaniard was within pi&s;tol-&s;hot before they had all got
<PB N="162" REF="167">
into the &s;hip; upon which, we cut our cable, and our &s;hip falling the wrong way, I had but ju&s;t room enough to fill clear of him. Being now clo&s;e by one another, his formidable ap|pearance &s;truck an univer&s;al damp on every one's &s;pirits; and I my&s;elf could fore&s;ee nothing but that we &s;hould be torn to pieces by him, and longed for an opportunity to try our heels with him, while our ma&s;ts were &s;tanding. I ex|pected every minute that he would board us, and, upon hearing a &s;houting among&s;t them, and &s;eeing their foreca&s;tle full of men, I concluded they had now come to that re&s;olution; but I pre&s;ently &s;aw that the occa&s;ion of this joy was their having &s;hot down our en&s;ign-&s;taff; upon which, they, &s;eeing our en&s;ign trailing in the water, were in hopes we had &s;truck: but I &s;oon undeceived them, by &s;preading a new en&s;ign in the mizzen-&s;hrouds. Upon &s;ight of this they lay &s;nug, and held their way clo&s;e upon our quarter; at la&s;t, de&s;igning to do our bu&s;ine&s;s at once, they clapped their helm well a &s;tarboard, to bring their whole broad&s;ide to point at us; but their fire had little or no effect. All &s;tood fa&s;t with us, and they muzzled them&s;elves; which gave me time both to get a-head, and to windward of him, before he could fill his &s;ails again; and now I found, that, if our ma&s;ts, which were by this time but &s;lenderly &s;upport|ed, would bear what &s;ail we had abroad, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;teal away from him. After this he was in a great hurry to get his &s;prit&s;ail-yard
<PB N="163" REF="168">
fore and aft, threatening us very hard, and ply|ing us with his fore-chace: but we &s;oon were out of his reach, and all hands were immediate|ly employed in repairing our damages. This &s;hip was called the Peregrine, of 56 guns, with upwards of 450 men on board of her.</P>
<P>During this action, we had not a man killed or wounded, although the enemy often hulled us, and once, in particular, a &s;hot coming into one of our ports, di&s;mounted one of our guns between decks, tearing off the nut of the gun, and breaking it&s;elf into a great many pieces, which flew fore and aft in the mid&s;t of a crowd of people, without hurting any one of them. Our &s;tern was al&s;o much &s;hattered, and our rigging much di&s;abled. Our main ma&s;t was a little wounded, yet &s;tood a long while with only-one good &s;hroud to &s;upport it; our fore-ma&s;t fared little better, yet I kept all the canva&s;s, ex|cept the main-top-gallant-&s;ail, at hard bats end. An unlucky &s;hot took the bow of our launch, as &s;he lay upon the quarter, and &s;et fire to &s;ome cartridges of powder, which were negligently left in her, and which blew away her moorings, and we lo&s;t her. Seeing a great &s;moke ari&s;e on the quarter, I at fir&s;t imagined &s;ome accident had happened within board. In &s;hort, in about three gla&s;&s;es we got quite clear of the Admiral, who tacked, and &s;tood in for Payta, and we &s;hortened &s;ail. A narrower e&s;cape from an enemy could not well have been made, con&s;ider|ing the va&s;t difference between us, as to force.
<PB N="164" REF="169">
The Spaniard had 56 guns; we, on the contrary, had but 20 mounted: they had 450 men; we, on our part, did not exceed 73; and 11 negroes and two Indians were included in that number. He had farther this great odds over us, of being in a &s;ettled readine&s;s, whil&s;t we were in the ut|mo&s;t confu&s;ion. As for our &s;mall arms they were wet and u&s;ele&s;s to us; and, what is more, in the mid&s;t of the engagement, one third of my people, in&s;tead of fighting, were hard at work, to make farther preparation for an ob&s;tinate re|&s;i&s;tance, if we had been pu&s;hed to extremities; and particularly the carpenter and his crew were bu&s;ied in making ports for &s;tern-chace-guns, which, as it happened, we made no u&s;e of. Upon the whole, we had the good fortune to e&s;cape this danger, which was the more to be dreaded, be|cau&s;e, as we had &s;et fire to the town, they were probably exa&s;perated upon the account of the churches, which I never intended to de&s;troy; and, if I had fallen into their hands, they might have given us but uncomfortable quarters. At the be&s;t, however, it cannot but be allowed to have been a mo&s;t unfortunate di&s;a&s;ter. The lo&s;s of my boat and anchor was irreparable, and may be &s;aid to be the cau&s;e of that &s;cene of trouble which will take up the remainder of this narra|tive; for we had now but one anchor, that at Payta being the third we had lo&s;t, and were be|&s;ides entirely de&s;titute of a boat of any kind.</P>
<P>At five, the &s;ame evening, we &s;aw a &s;ail under our lee-bow, which I took to be the prize we
<PB N="165" REF="170">
had left to crui&s;e for us near the Saddle of Payta; and we, therefore, &s;tood to the we&s;t|ward all night, and the next morning we &s;aw two &s;ail a-&s;tern of us. I tacked, and &s;tood to|wards them, and in a little time could &s;ee that one of them was &s;tanding in for Payta, while the other kept &s;temming with us; but the nearer I approached her, the le&s;s I liked her, and could not but think it advi&s;eable to put my &s;hip about, and crowd &s;ail from her. However, &s;he gained upon us, and advanced near enough to &s;hew us &s;he was the Brilliant, the Admiral's con&s;ort. She was a French built &s;hip, of 36 guns, manned with people of that nation, and other Europeans. She was hand&s;omely rigged, which is rare to be &s;een in tho&s;e parts, and &s;ailed almo&s;t two foot for our one; &s;o that, notwith&s;tanding we had almo&s;t a calm all the heat of the day, &s;he near|ed us apace. But, night coming on, I made u&s;e of the old &s;tratagem (I thought it might be new here), of turning a light adrift in a half tub, in|&s;tead of a boat, darkening one part of the lan|thorn, that it might the more appear to be a &s;hip's light, and then immediately altered my cour&s;e. As the day broke I hauled all my &s;ails, and in full day-light could perceive nothing of the enemy. This was the &s;hip wherein Betagh, my late Captain of marines, was &s;o much re|&s;pected; and by his advice it was, as I have been told, that the Admiral ordered his con&s;ort to ply up to windward to Lobos, our fir&s;t place of rendezvous, whil&s;t he him&s;elf came to Payta
<PB N="166" REF="171">
in &s;earch of us. This &s;eparation, though intend|ed as a &s;ure means to catch us, proved to be very fortunately the means of our pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Being thus clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, I took an offing of thirty leagues from the &s;hore, and then brought to, to con&s;ider what I had be&s;t to do. I was &s;till in the dark, as to my con&s;ort; an em|bargo, as I was told at Payta, was laid on aft &s;hipping to leeward for the term of &s;ix months; and our prize, which I de&s;igned to make a fire|&s;hip of, was taken by the Brilliant; I had but one anchor, and no boat at all; and I was as yet ignorant of what had become of the Mercury.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this peril and perplexity, I called my officers together, to let them know, it was my opinion, we had, as we were thus cir|cum&s;tanced, a much better pro&s;pect to the wind|ward than to the leeward; that on the coa&s;t of Chili we &s;hould not be in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, and &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, in the mo&s;t effec|tual manner, e&s;cape the enemy's men-of-war; that, after taking in water at Juan Fernandez, we might crui&s;e out the whole &s;ea&s;on off the ports of Conception, Valparai&s;o, and Coquimbo, where among the &s;hipping we might be &s;tocked with anchors, cables, boats, and a ve&s;&s;el to make a fire-&s;hip of, on which I mightily depended. All this being univer&s;ally approved of, we got our tacks on board, and &s;tretched away to windward.</P>
<P>My intentions after this were fixed upon the
<PB N="167" REF="172">
coa&s;t of Mexico. There I propo&s;ed to run the height of Tres Marias and California, as the mo&s;t likely places to meet with the Succe&s;s. The&s;e two places would have been commodi|ous; the fir&s;t for &s;alting of turtle, and the la&s;t for wooding and watering at, and for laying my|&s;elf in the track of the Manilla &s;hip, which, if I &s;hould have had the fortune to meet with, and, having a fire-&s;hip with me, I would have tried what I could have done with her.</P>
<P>March 26, having well &s;ecured our ma&s;t, and bent a new &s;uit of &s;ails, we &s;tood to the &s;outh|ward, expecting to gain our pa&s;&s;age to wind|ward in about five weeks.</P>
<P>March 31, as they were pumping the &s;hip, the water which came out of the well, was not only in greater quantity than u&s;ual, but was al&s;o as black as ink. This made me judge that &s;ome water had got to our powder; and accordingly going into the powder-room, we heard the wa|ter come in like a little &s;luice. This had quite &s;poiled the greate&s;t part of our powder; &s;o that we only &s;aved the quantity of &s;ix barrels. We found upon &s;earch a leak to be on the bow, un|der the lower cheek of the head, occa&s;ioned by a &s;hot which had been lodged there in our late en|gagement, and which falling out by the working of the &s;hip in an head &s;ea, had left room for a &s;tream of water; but we brought the &s;hip by the &s;tern, and, with great difficulty, &s;topped it &s;ecurely.</P>
<P>May 11, we &s;aw the great i&s;land of Juan
<PB N="168" REF="173">
Fernandez, bearing ea&s;t half &s;outh. Here I plied on and off till the 21&s;t, but could not get off as much water as we daily expended.</P>
<P>May 21, a hard gale of wind came out of the &s;ea upon us, and brought in with it a tumbling &s;well; &s;o that in a few hours, our cable, which was never wet before, parted, and inevitable &s;hipwreck appeared before our eyes. But Pro|vidence &s;o far interpo&s;ed in our behalf, that, if we had &s;truck but a cable's length farther to the ea&s;tward or we&s;tward of the place where we did &s;trike, we mu&s;t certainly all have peri&s;hed. Our main-ma&s;t, fore-ma&s;t, and mizzen-top-ma&s;t, went all away together; and happy it was for us that they did &s;o; for, by making them &s;erve by way of raft, and by the help of tho&s;e who were a&s;hore before the wind came on, we were all &s;aved, except one man. In the mid&s;t of this &s;urprize, the fir&s;t thing I took care of, was my commi&s;&s;ion; and, remembering the powder to be uppermo&s;t in the bread-room, I got mo&s;t of it up, with about &s;even or eight bags of bread: the&s;e we &s;aved, as the &s;hip did not come to pieces immediately. In a few minutes, however, after &s;he fir&s;t &s;truck, &s;he was full of water. We &s;aved, notwith&s;tanding, two or three compa&s;&s;es, &s;ome of our mathematical in&s;truments, and books.</P>
<P>When we fir&s;t got on &s;hore, we were without any one thing nece&s;&s;ary for our relief; not &s;o much as a &s;eat whereon to re&s;t our harra&s;&s;ed limbs, except the wet ground, which, as far as
<PB N="169" REF="174">
we could &s;ee, was al&s;o like to be our bed and pillow, and indeed it proved to be &s;o.</P>
<P>In the evening, all the officers came to con&s;ult with me, how we &s;hould get &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries out of the wreck; and, having by this time lighted a fire, we wrapt our&s;elves in what we could get, laid our&s;elves round it, and, notwith&s;tanding the badne&s;s of the weather, we &s;lept very &s;oundly; but, the next morning, getting up with the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of day-light, we looked at each other like men awakened out of a dream; &s;o great and &s;o &s;udden was the melancholy change in our condition, that we could &s;carce tru&s;t to our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>I went immediately among the people to &s;et them about the work we had re&s;olved upon the night before; but they were &s;o &s;cattered, there was no getting them together, or we might, pro|bably, have regained all our beef and pork. This opportunity, however, was lo&s;t, by their eager|ne&s;s to build huts and tents, in order to &s;ettle them&s;elves for good; for, while they were thus employed, a furious gale of wind came on, which de&s;troyed all the provi&s;ions in the &s;hip, except one ca&s;k of beef, and one of farina de pao, which were wa&s;hed whole on the &s;trand. I had &s;aved 1100 dollars belonging to the gentlemen adventurers, which were kept in my che&s;t in the great cabbin; the re&s;t, being in the bottom of the bread-room for &s;ecurity, could not po&s;&s;ibly be come at. I need not &s;ay how di&s;con&s;olate my reflections were on the &s;ad accident that had
<PB N="170" REF="175">
happened. My fir&s;t thoughts were on the means whereby to pre&s;erve our lives, and on &s;ome &s;cheme of oeconomy to be ob&s;erved a|mong&s;t the people, in relation to the di&s;tribu|tion of &s;uch quantities of provi&s;ions as &s;hould from time to time be obtained.</P>
<P>I found a very commodious &s;pot of ground about half a mile from the &s;ea, on which I &s;et up my tent. There was a fine run of water within a &s;tone's ca&s;t of it on each &s;ide, with fir|ing near at hand, and trees proper for our u&s;e. The people &s;ettled within call about me, in as good a manner as they could: and having all &s;ecured our&s;elves again&s;t the inclemency of the weather, we u&s;ed to pa&s;s our time in the even|ing round a great fire, roa&s;ting craw-fi&s;h in the embers.</P>
<P>I now began to think of building &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el from the wreck as might carry us all off at once from this i&s;land; and for that purpo&s;e con&s;ult|ed with the carpenter; but was a&s;toni&s;hed at his an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">'he could not make brick, he &s;aid, without &s;traw,'</Q> and walked away from me in a &s;urly humour. From him I went to the ar|mourer, and a&s;ked him what he could do to|wards building a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el for us; to which he an&s;wered, that he hoped he could do all the iron work; that he had, with much labour, got his be&s;tows out of the wreck, and that he did not doubt but we &s;hould find a great many other u&s;eful things, when we came to &s;et about a &s;earch for them in good earne&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="176">June 8, we laid the blocks, and got the bow|&s;prit ready to make a keel. The carpenter for a little while went on with &s;eeming good temper, but &s;uddenly turning &s;hort upon me as I &s;tood by him, he &s;wore a great oath, he would not &s;trike another &s;troke, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he truly would be no body's &s;lave, and thought him&s;elf now upon a footing with my&s;elf.'</Q> This provoked me to u&s;e him a little roughly with my cane; but af|terwards came to an agreement with him to give him a four-pi&s;tole piece as &s;oon as the &s;tem and &s;tern-po&s;t were up, and 100 pieces of eight when the bark was fini&s;hed. He then went to work on the keel, and in two months time we made a tolerable &s;how, owing to the diligence and ingenuity of Popple&s;tone, the armourer, who made us hammers, chi&s;&s;els, files, gimlets, bullet-moulds, and an in&s;trument to bore our cartouch boxes. The&s;e la&s;t we covered with &s;eals &s;kins, and contrived them &s;o as to be both handy and neat. He, be&s;ides all this, began and fini&s;hed with his own hands, a large &s;erviceable boat, which was what we very much &s;tood in need of.</P>
<P>For a few days the people behaved them&s;elves very regularly and diligently, half of them work|ing one day, and half another. But the time &s;oon arrived when we fell into &s;uch confu&s;ion and outrageous di&s;order, that it was a miracle we ever got off from this place by any a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our own; for, one afternoon, I mi&s;&s;ed all the people, and could &s;ee no body but Mr. Adams,
<PB N="172" REF="177">
our &s;urgeon, Mr. Hendry the agent, my &s;on, and Mr. Dodd, lieutenant of marines, who, for &s;ome rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, had a mind to act the madman. At night I was informed, they had a&s;&s;embled together at a great tree, had formed a new regulation and new articles, had excluded the gentlemen adventurers in England from having any part of what we &s;hould take for the future, and had dive&s;ted me of the authority of their Captain, having regulated them&s;elves ac|cording to the di&s;cipline of Jamaica. They had cho&s;en Morphew to be their champion and &s;peaker. This man addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and told me, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that, as the Speedwell was ca&s;t away, they were now of con&s;equence at their own di&s;po&s;al, &s;o that their obligations to the owners and me were of no validity, the &s;hip being now no more; they therefore, he &s;aid, had now thought fit to frame &s;uch articles as would be mo&s;t conducive to their own intere&s;t; and, if I would &s;ign them, well; if not, they would not tru&s;t them&s;elves under my conduct, as they &s;hould always be apprehen&s;ive that I &s;hould &s;erve them as Clipperton had &s;erved &s;ome of his men, who (they heard) happening to be taken &s;eparately, he denied them, and &s;uffered eight of them to be hanged as pirates before his race.'</Q></P>
<P>In the&s;e articles, be&s;ides ca&s;ting off the own|ers, I found my&s;elf reduced from &s;ixty &s;hares to &s;ix. I was at a lo&s;s what to do in this di|lemma; but at la&s;t I found my&s;elf under an in|di&s;pen&s;ible
<PB N="173" REF="178">
nece&s;&s;ity of &s;igning the articles, in order to get off from the i&s;land, where otherwi&s;e I might have been forcibly left behind.</P>
<P>And now, having very unwillingly &s;atisfied them in all I thought they could a&s;k, I recom|mended to them the ve&s;&s;el we had begun, not doubting, but after this they would have u&s;ed their con&s;tant endeavours to fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h her, that they might have an opportunity of putting their pro|ject in execution; and they &s;aid they would.</P>
<P>But early the next morning, going down to the beach as u&s;ual, and expecting to find every one employed, I &s;aw none of them, except the carpenter, and two or three more; for, notwith|&s;tanding they were abettors of the de&s;igns that were carrying on, yet the hopes of a little money from me had made them work pretty diligently, though I cannot &s;ay they fatigued them&s;elves. Upon enquiry, I was informed, that the re&s;t of the people were again adjourned to the great tree; and it was not long before I was made acquaint|ed with the re&s;ult of their meeting; for, betimes the next morning, they &s;urrounded my tent, while Morphew, and Stewart, their agent, came in to me, and told me. They came in the name of all the people to demand every thing be|longing to the gentlemen adventurers out of my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and particularly 750 weight in Pinna or virgin &s;ilver, a &s;ilver di&s;h weighing 75 ounces, and 250 dollars in money, I did not ea&s;ily part with all this: but they de&s;ired I would make no di&s;pute; for, as all this came out of the wreck,
<PB N="174" REF="179">
they in&s;i&s;ted, the owners could have nothing to do with it, and they were determined to have it. In &s;hort, I was obliged to give it all up, and they &s;hared it among&s;t them that very moment, according to their new regulation.</P>
<P>After this, they entirely de&s;troyed what little power they had allowed me over them; and the meane&s;t of them were taught they were as good as I. They &s;ometimes denied me a quota of the fi&s;h, and wondered I could not go out to catch it as well as they; at be&s;t, they would give my &s;ervant who u&s;ed to fetch it but the leavings, af|ter they had cho&s;en the prime: and, to complete their in&s;ults, my fir&s;t lieutenant, who u&s;ed &s;ome|times to eat with me, entirely de&s;erted my me&s;s to join Morphew, to partake of his better fare.</P>
<P>Quite tired out with their ince&s;&s;ant mutinies, I became at length &s;o de&s;perate, that I began to think of preferring the dangers of the &s;ea, in a &s;mall open boat, to what I thought my&s;elf ex|po&s;ed to on this place from my &s;hip's company. I apprehended, they would never re&s;t till they had made them&s;elves entirely their own ma&s;ters, by privately making away with me; and this made me melancholy and pen&s;ive, preparing my&s;elf for the wor&s;t that could happen. They perceiving this change in me, grew &s;u&s;picious that I was now contriving &s;ome means to reduce them; and, therefore, they determined to get the arms out of my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. To this purpo&s;e they all came in a body, headed by Brooks and Morphew, who, in the pre&s;ence of all the
<PB N="175" REF="180">
people, u&s;ed me with in&s;upportable impudence; and even went &s;o far as to threaten the life of my &s;on, for only telling Morphew, that every one pre&s;ent had not cho&s;en him for his &s;peaker.</P>
<P>Having gained that point al&s;o, they had the plea&s;ure of &s;quandering away their time, and powder and &s;hot, in firing at cats, or any thing el&s;e, to wa&s;te the ammunition.</P>
<P>What I hare now related, is the &s;ub&s;tance of what occurred from May 24 till Augu&s;t 15, when we had &s;ight of a large &s;hip, which put us into a great hurry, and gave us a con&s;iderable alarm. Before &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the bay, I ordered all the fires to be put out, and confined the negroes and Indians, le&s;t the &s;hip &s;hould be becalmed under the land, and any of them &s;hould attempt to &s;wim off to her. However, I was not long in fear, for &s;he kept away large, and at too great a di&s;tance to perceive any thing di&s;tinctly of us.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion I got mo&s;t of the people under arms, and was glad to &s;ee &s;o many of them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, obedient to command. I told them, I was plea&s;ed to &s;ee their arms in &s;uch good order; to which they an&s;wered im|pertinently, that it was for their own &s;akes. But this alarm was &s;carce &s;ub&s;ided before they be|came divided among them&s;elves. The que&s;tion &s;tarted was, whether or no the bark &s;hould be carried on, or, whether they &s;hould not build two large &s;hallops, and &s;et what was done of the bark on fire. The workmen, and a con&s;idera|ble majority of the re&s;t, &s;ided with me in be|half
<PB N="176" REF="181">
half of the bark: but at night the carpenter &s;ent me word, that, if I did not deliver him the money agreed on at the beginning, notwith&s;tand|ing the terms of the payment of it were not yet fulfilled, I &s;hould not &s;ee his face again; &s;o I was obliged to treat this gentleman as he plea&s;ed to have me, and rai&s;e the money for him.</P>
<P>To complete the number of our divi&s;ions and di&s;&s;entions, there aro&s;e a third party, who were re&s;olved to have nothing to do with the other two, they purpo&s;ing to &s;tay on the i&s;land. The&s;e were to the number of 12, who accord|ingly &s;eparated them&s;elves from the re&s;t, and never appeared among&s;t us, except in the night, when they u&s;ed to come about our tents, and the bark we were building, to &s;teal powder, lead, and axes, and in &s;hort, whatever el&s;e they could lay their hands on. The&s;e, however, I found means to manage, and took from them all their arms, ammunition, and the re&s;t of their plunder, and threatened, that, if they were found within mu&s;quet-&s;hot of our tents, they &s;hould be treat|ed as enemies.</P>
<P>In a little time the&s;e divi&s;ions had &s;o far weakened the whole body, that, by degrees, they began to li&s;ten a little to what I &s;aid to them; and I prevailed &s;o far as to get mo&s;t of them into a working humour. Mr. Brooks now came with a feigned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ired he might eat with me again; but this, in the main, abated nothing of his e&s;teem for Morphew. His di&s;&s;imulation, however, proved of &s;ignal &s;ervice,
<PB N="177" REF="182">
as it contributed to the &s;peedy fini&s;hing of the bark. This claimed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all our heads and hands; for when we came to plank her bottom, we had mo&s;t di&s;heartening difficul|ties to encounter; for, having no plank but pieces of the wreck's deck, we found it &s;o dry and &s;tubborn, that fire and water had &s;carce any effect in making it pliable and fit for u&s;e. It rent and &s;plit, and flew like gla&s;s; &s;o that now I had &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to believe, after all our labour, that we mu&s;t patiently wait to be taken off from hence by &s;ome Spani&s;h &s;hip, and, after all our troubles, be led to a pri&s;on, to reflect on our misfortunes pa&s;t. However, by con&s;tant labour, and a variety of contrivances, we, in the end, patched our bark up in &s;uch a manner, that I dare &s;ay the like was never &s;een, and I may venture to affirm, that &s;uch a bottom never &s;wam on the &s;urface of the &s;ea before.</P>
<P>Sept. 9, the boat, which I have already men|tioned to be begun by the armourer, was launch|ed; and, being now in a fair way of compleating our bark, there yet remained, uncon&s;idered and undetermined, what provi&s;ions we &s;hould get to &s;upport us in our pre&s;ent voyage. All the &s;tock we had con&s;i&s;ted of but one ca&s;k of beef, five or &s;ix bu&s;hels of farina or Ca&s;&s;ader flour, together with four or five live hogs.</P>
<P>I made &s;everal experiments to cure both fi&s;h and &s;eal, but found it impo&s;&s;ible. At length, we luckily thought on a method of curing the conger-eel, by &s;plitting it, and taking out the
<PB N="178" REF="183">
back-bone, then dipping it in &s;alt-water, and af|terwards hanging it up to dry in a great &s;moke. As no other fi&s;h could be pre&s;erved after this manner, the fi&s;hermen were ordered to catch what congers they could. And now &s;everal of the people, who had not yet &s;truck a &s;troke, began to repent of their folly, as they grew weary of living on this place, and offered their &s;ervice to go a fi&s;hing, every one making &s;ome fooli&s;h excu&s;e or other, for having been &s;o long idle. The new boat being &s;ent to try her for|tune, returned at night, and brought in a great parcel of fi&s;h of &s;everal &s;orts, among&s;t which were 200 conger-eels. This was a good begin|ning, and every tent took a proportion of them to cure.</P>
<P>Having this conveniency of a large boat, I de&s;ired Mr. Brooks, our only diver, to try what he could recover from that part of the wreck which lay under water. He accordingly under|took it, and could find but one &s;mall gun, which he weighed and brought on &s;hore, together with two pieces of a large church candle&s;tick, which was a part of the plate which belonged to the gentlemen adventurers.</P>
<P>Our boat was now daily employed in fi&s;hing. The armourer con&s;tantly &s;upplied them with hooks, and there was no want of lines, which were made of twi&s;ted ribbon. In the mean time, tho&s;e who were a&s;hore, made twice layed &s;tuff for rigging and other u&s;es. We patched up the canvas for &s;ails; the cooper completed
<PB N="179" REF="184">
his ca&s;ks; and, in a &s;hort time, we had ma&s;ts an-end tolerably well rigged, and thought we made a comfortable figure.</P>
<P>And now, having done all we could, when we came to put in water, to try the tightne&s;s of our work, it was followed by an univer&s;al outcry, <HI>A &s;ieve! a &s;ieve!</HI> I was afraid the people would have de&s;paired, and de&s;i&s;ted from u&s;ing any far|ther means: but, in a little time, and by ince&s;|&s;ant labour, we repaired the &s;hip's pumps, and fitted them to our bark. The next &s;pring-tide we found means to launch her, which fell out on the 5th of October, by which time we had &s;aved about 2300 conger-eels, weighing, one with another, about one pound each, and made about 60 gallons of &s;eals oil to fry them in. This, with what I mentioned before, was all our &s;ea-&s;tock. As &s;he went off the blocks, I named her the <HI>Recovery,</HI> though I was &s;adly afraid of hearing ill news from tho&s;e afloat in her; but all proved indifferently well; and, knowing it to be dangerous for her to lie here long, e&s;pecially having no other anchor than a great &s;tone, and a &s;light rope to hold her with, and that the lea&s;t puff of wind might have driven and de&s;troyed her upon the rocks, we got all the water off that day, which we did &s;o much ea&s;ier and quicker, becau&s;e the ca&s;ks were ready &s;towed in the hold. She had two ma&s;ts, and was of about the burthen of twenty tons; and, to my great &s;atisfaction, I found, that one pump, con&s;tantly working, kept her free. The next day, October the 6th, we
<PB N="180" REF="185">
got every one on board and embarked, leaving behind us eleven or twelve of tho&s;e who had de&s;erted us. They were deaf to all per&s;ua&s;ions; and, in &s;hort, &s;ent me word, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'They were not yet prepared for the other world;'</Q> &s;o they, with the like number of blacks and Indians, remained behind on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>This i&s;land enjoys a fine whole&s;ome air, in&s;o|much that, out of 70 of us that were on it for the &s;pace of five months and eleven days, not one of us had an hour's &s;ickne&s;s, notwith&s;tanding we fed on foul diet, without bread or &s;alt. For my own part, I mu&s;t acknowledge the bounty of Providence; for, although I lo&s;t much of my fle&s;h, I became one of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t active men on the i&s;land, from being before very corpulent, and almo&s;t crippled with the gout. On the tops of &s;ome of the mountains of this i&s;land, are plains covered with groves of the Italian laurel. Palm-trees are likewi&s;e found in mo&s;t parts, growing in &s;mooth joints like a cane, &s;ome 30, &s;ome 40 feet high. What &s;eamen call palm-cabbage is the very &s;ub&s;tance of the head of this tree, which being cut off, you find in|clo&s;ed a white and tender young cabbage: but, for every one we got, we were obliged to cut down a fine lofty tree.</P>
<P>The northern part of this i&s;land is very well watered, and the water keeps well at &s;ea, and is, I dare &s;ay, as good as any in the world. Down the we&s;tern peak de&s;cend two ca&s;cades, to ap|pearance, at lea&s;t 300 feet perpendicular; which,

with the palm-trees that grow up clo&s;e by the edges of them, exhibit a very grand and roman|tic pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>We might have found goats enough in the mountains, if we had been able to follow them; and cats are &s;o numerous, that there is hardly taking a &s;tep without &s;tarting one. Tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tomachs could bear their fle&s;h for food, found a more &s;ub&s;tantial relief from hunger by one meal of it, than from four or five of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, who fir&s;t &s;tocked this i&s;land with goats, have &s;ince endeavoured to de&s;troy the&s;e goats by dogs, which are likewi&s;e very nu|merous; but the goats have many inacce&s;&s;ible places of refuge, where no dogs can follow them; and they &s;till continue to afford a plen|tiful &s;upply to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>While we were here, it was the &s;ea&s;on for the &s;ea-lione&s;&s;es to come to land, to bring forth their young. The&s;e have bodies of a mon&s;trous bulk, being from 10 to 12 feet long, and near as much in circumference. I may venture to affirm, that, one with another, they would yield each a butt of train oil. They are &s;o indolent, that, as &s;oon as they have gained the land, they fall a&s;leep, and in that condition remain a month together &s;o torpid, that you might fire a pi&s;tol at their heads without di&s;turbing them; but where the &s;ea-lione&s;&s;es lie, as they do in companies after they have yeaned, to give &s;uck to their young, there is always an old lion, of the large&s;t &s;ize, ince&s;&s;antly on the watch, and at the approach of
<PB N="182" REF="188">
an enemy makes a hideous roaring, threatening death to him who &s;hould be &s;o hardy as to mo|le&s;t his charge; and, in truth, were they not &s;o unweildy, they would be a de&s;perate creature to encounter. We were accu&s;tomed to walk a|mong&s;t them without dread; for all, but tho&s;e who were to take care of the young, were lo&s;t in the profounde&s;t &s;lumbers. On the land they in|gender, and bring forth their young, who ingen|der al&s;o before they go off, again&s;t the next &s;ea|&s;on; &s;o quick and &s;uddenly do they increa&s;e and propagate.</P>
<P>The &s;eals here may properly be called &s;ea-wolves, from the re&s;emblance of their heads to the heads of wolves, differing in that particular from the &s;eals in the northern hemi&s;phere, where their heads are more like the dog's. They are naturally &s;urly, and &s;narl in an angry manner, on the approach of any body. Two fins compo&s;e their tails, and with the help of the&s;e they get along much fa&s;ter than the lions.</P>
<P>Every thing one &s;ees or hears in this i&s;land is different from what is el&s;ewhere to be found. The very &s;tructure of the i&s;land, in all its parts, appears with a certain &s;avage, irregular beauty, nor ea&s;y to be expre&s;&s;ed. The &s;everal pro&s;pects of lofty inacce&s;&s;ible hills in the day, and the &s;o|litarine&s;s of the gloomy narrow vallies in the night, added to the mixed, confu&s;ed noi&s;e of the &s;urge continually beating again&s;t the &s;hore, the tumbling of the waters from an immen&s;e precipice, the roaring of &s;ea lions and &s;ea-wolves,
<PB N="183" REF="189">
who&s;e voices are more or le&s;s &s;hrill or hoar&s;e according to their youth or age, compo&s;e &s;o wild and horrible a medley, that the &s;toute&s;t man mu&s;t long be accu&s;tomed to it, before he can ta&s;te the &s;weets of refre&s;hing &s;leep, or wholly dive&s;t him&s;elf of terror.</P>
<P>October 6, we &s;et &s;ail, with nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on at &s;ea but the before-mentioned &s;moked con|gers, one ca&s;k of beef, and four live hogs, toge|ther with three or four bu&s;hels of farina. We were upwards of forty of us crowded together, and lying upon bundles of eels, with no conve|nience of keeping the men clean, nor any thing to defend us from their abominable &s;tench; not a drop of water to be had without &s;ucking it out of the ca&s;k through a pipe, which being u&s;ed pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly, became intolerably nau&s;eous. The un&s;avoury mor&s;els we daily ate created perpetual quarrels among&s;t us, every one contending for the frying-pan. All the conveniency we had for firing, was an half tub filled with earth, which made our cooking &s;o tedious, that we had a con|tinual noi&s;e of frying from morning till night.</P>
<P>Thus we traver&s;ed the ocean: happy, how|ever, in the thought of being once more afloat, and cheri&s;hing the hope that &s;omething would &s;peedily fall into our hands. Every day, while the &s;ea-breeze continued, we were hard put to it, for not having above 16 inches free board, and our bark tumbling prodigiou&s;ly, the water con|tinually ran over us; and, having only a grating
<PB N="184" REF="190">
deck, and no tarpaulin to cover it, our pumps would but ju&s;t keep us free.</P>
<P>October 10, being the fourth day of our new expedition, we fell in with a large &s;hip, which I could plainly &s;ee was Europe built. This &s;truck me with the dread of her being a man-of-war; however, our ca&s;e being de&s;perate, I &s;tood for her, and, before we could get quite up with her, the enemy di&s;covered the brownne&s;s of our can|vas, and, &s;u&s;pecting us, wore &s;hip, and hauled clo&s;e on a wind to the we&s;tward. This done, they hoi&s;ted their colours, fired a gun, and crouded away from us at a great rate; but, in about two hours it fell calm, and we had re|cour&s;e to our oars. In the mean time we over|hauled our arms, which we found to be in very bad condition, one-third of them being without flints, and we had but three cutla&s;&s;es; &s;o that we were but ill prepared for boarding, which was the only means we could have of taking any &s;hip. We had but one &s;mall cannon, which we could not mount, and therefore were obliged to fire it as it lay along upon the deck; and to &s;upply it we had no more ammunition than two round &s;hot, a few chain-bolts and bolt-heads, the clap|per of the Speedwell's bell, and &s;ome bags of beach-&s;tones to &s;erve for partridge. In about four hours we came up with this &s;hip, and every one &s;eemed as ea&s;y in his mind as if actually in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her. But, as we advanced nearer, I &s;aw her guns and patararoes, and a con&s;iderable number of men upon deck, with their arms glit|tering

in the &s;un, who called out to us by the name of Engli&s;h dogs, defying us, in a &s;cornful way, to come on board of them, and at the &s;ame time gave us a volley of great and &s;mall &s;hot, which killed our gunner, and almo&s;t brought our fore-ma&s;t by the board. This warm recep|tion &s;taggered a great many of my men who before &s;eemed the forwarde&s;t, in&s;omuch that they lay upon their oars for &s;ome time, in &s;pite of all I could do to make them keep their way. We recovered our&s;elves again, and rowed clo&s;e up with the enemy, and engaged them till all our &s;mall &s;hot was expended, which obliged us to fall a&s;tern to make &s;ome &s;lugs. In this man|ner we made three attempts, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>All the night it was calm, and we were bu&s;ied in making &s;lugs, and had provided a large quan|tity by the next morning, when we came to a final determination of either carrying the &s;hip, or of &s;ubmitting to her; and accordingly, at day-break, I ordered twenty men in our yaul, to lay her athwart the haw&s;e, whil&s;t I boarded her in the bark. The people in the boat put off, giving me repeated a&s;&s;urances of their good behaviour; but, at the very juncture we were coming to action, a gale &s;prang up, and &s;he went away from us.</P>
<P>This &s;hip was called the Margarita, and was the &s;ame which had been a privateer belonging to St. Malo's, and mounted forty guns, all the la&s;t war. In the &s;kirmi&s;hes we had with her,
<PB N="186" REF="192">
we had none killed, except Gilbert Hender&s;on, our gunner; and only three were wounded, viz. Mr. Brooks, Fir&s;t Lieutenant, through the thigh, Mr. Cold&s;ea, the Ma&s;ter, through the groin, and one of the fore-ma&s;t-men through the &s;mall of his back. Two of the&s;e did very well, and I think there was &s;omething extraordinary in their cure; for the &s;urgeon had nothing to apply to their wounds, but what he him&s;elf had prepared with &s;eals-oil, and other matters he had found on the i&s;land. Mr. Cold&s;ea, indeed, lingered in a mi&s;erable manner for nine or ten months; but at length recovered.</P>
<P>Our condition now grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e; for &s;oon after we had parted from this &s;hip, a bard gale came on, which la&s;ted four days with|out cea&s;ing, during all which time we had not an hour's hope of living a minute. We were obliged to &s;cud away under bare poles, with our yaul in tow; and, having but a &s;hort &s;cope of boat-rope, we were, on the de&s;cent of every &s;ea, in the greate&s;t danger of having the bark's &s;tern beat in by the violence of the boat's pre|cipitate fail after us; and, once in particular, a great hollow &s;ea had like to have thrown her upon our deck, which would have put an end to our voyage immediately. The exce&s;&s;ive fright of this &s;torm made many of our people form a re&s;olution of going on &s;hore the very fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>In this extremity, calling to mind M. Fre|zier's account of Iquique, I mentioned the &s;ur|prizal
<PB N="187" REF="193">
of that place to the crew, which being univer&s;ally approved of, we directed our cour&s;e to that i&s;land.</P>
<P>It was three weeks before we got this length; and having nothing to ride the bark with, we were obliged to keep the &s;ea with her, whil&s;t the boat went in between the rocks, and was received by &s;ome Indians on the &s;trand with a &s;ort of welcome. The men, being landed, went to the Lieutenant's hou&s;e, broke it open, and rummaged the whole village, where they found a booty more valuable to us at that time than gold and &s;ilver. It con&s;i&s;ted of about &s;ixty bu&s;hels of wheat-flour, 120 of Calavances and corn, &s;ome jerked beef, pork and mutton, &s;ome thou&s;and weight of well-cured fi&s;h, a good number of fowls, &s;ome ru&s;k, and four or five days eating of &s;oft bread, together with five or &s;ix jars of Peruvian wine and brandy; and, to crown all, they had the good fortune to find a large boat near the &s;hore, to bring off the booty with, which otherwi&s;e would have been of little u&s;e to us, our own boat being already &s;uffi|ciently laden with the men.</P>
<P>Words cannot expre&s;s the joy that reigned among us when they came on board: the &s;cene was now changed from famine to plenty; the loaves of &s;oft bread were di&s;tributed to every one, and the jars of wine were broached; but I took care they &s;hould drink but moderately of it, each man having no more than half a pint to his &s;hare: and, after a day or two's
<PB N="188" REF="194">
living on whole&s;ome diet, we wondered how our &s;tomachs had been able to dige&s;t our rank and nau&s;eous eels fried in train oil, and could &s;carcely believe we had lived upon nothing el&s;e for a month pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Randall, our Second Lieutenant, who commanded in this enterprize, told me, they did not meet with the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, and that the few Indians they found &s;eemed to be as glad of this opportunity of pillaging the Spaniards as we were.</P>
<P>The &s;ettlement at Iquique con&s;i&s;ts of about 60 &s;cattered ill-built hou&s;es, which hardly de&s;erve that name, and a &s;mall church. There is not the lea&s;t verdure to be &s;een in or about it, nor does it afford the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of life, of its own product, not even water, which they are obliged to fetch in boats from Pi&s;agua, ten leagues to the northward.</P>
<P>By two Indian pri&s;oners we took here, we were informed, that the Lieutenant's boat was then at Pi&s;agua, and that it would not be long before her return; however, being determined to make &s;ome attempt in the road of le Na&s;co, in lat 16 deg. S. and at Pi&s;co, in lat. 13 deg. 45 min. S. we &s;et &s;ail, and the very morning we came off the Sierra or high-land of le Na&s;co, two hours before day-light, we fell in with a large &s;hip. The circum&s;tances of our meeting and engaging her were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the &s;ame with tho&s;e we had with the Margarita. We met with both at the &s;ame time in the
<PB N="189" REF="195">
morning, and, whil&s;t in pur&s;uit of both, had the misfortune of being becalmed. We &s;trug|gled with this la&s;t for &s;ix or &s;even hours, and were at length obliged to leave her, becau&s;e the &s;ea-breeze came in &s;o &s;trong, and the &s;ea ran &s;o high, that, had &s;he been of no force, our &s;light bark mu&s;t have been in pieces before a third part of us could have entered her. This &s;hip was called the St. Franci&s;co Palacio&punc; of 700 tons, eight guns and ten pete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">aroes, and was well manned and provided with &s;mall arms.</P>
<P>It happened very unfortunately, that we &s;hould thus mi&s;s two of the be&s;t equipped &s;hips in the private trade at that time in the South Seas. This la&s;t repul&s;e was made a pretence for much murmuring; many, de&s;pairing of ever being able to take any thing as our condition was, were for &s;urrendering to the enemy, who was all the night becalmed near us. To pre|vent their de&s;ign, I took care to remove the two boats out of their power, by ordering two men in each of them, &s;uch as I thought I could tru&s;t, and to ca&s;t off from us at a little di&s;tance, that none might e&s;cape in them. But, notwith&s;tanding the confidence I had in the&s;e four, the two in the be&s;t boat ran away with her; and the next day I was informed, that the Fir&s;t Lieutenant and Morphew had made a party, too &s;trong for me to oppo&s;e, to go away with the boat that was left; but, it blow|ing fre&s;h the next night, they were prevented from executing their de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="196">The next day we &s;tood into the road of Pi&s;co, as we had de&s;igned, where we di&s;covered what appeared to be a large &s;hip. We bore down to her with a re&s;olute de&s;pair, and laid her athwart the haw&s;e; but, to our great &s;atis|faction, we met with no re&s;i&s;tance, and were received by the Captain and his Officers with their hats off, in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner a&s;king for quarter. Before we came up, I had ordered our boat to intercept theirs, which was going on &s;hore. They clapped her on board, but, not holding fa&s;t, they fell a&s;tern, and could not fetch up with her again; &s;o that in this boat was conveyed away every thing that might have been valuable in the prize. She was a good &s;hip, of about 200 tons, called the Je&s;us-Maria, almo&s;t laden with pitch, tar, copper, and plank, but nothing el&s;e. The Captain offer|ed 1600 dollars for her ran&s;om, but I could not give ear to it in the condition which I was then in.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h Captain informed me, that the Margarita had been arrived &s;ome time at Callao, where &s;he had given a full account of us; that the Captain of her, and three more, were killed in the action with us, and that the Prie&s;t and &s;everal others were wounded; and that &s;he was now ready to put to &s;ea again, with an addition of ten guns and fifty men; to crui&s;e for us: and, moreover, that the Flying fi&s;h, a frigate of 28 guns, was already out with the &s;ame in|tent. Upon this advice, having cleared our
<PB N="191" REF="197">
bark, we gave her to the Spani&s;h Captain, and as &s;oon as the breeze &s;prang up, we weighed, and went to &s;ea, and in going out met with our boat, which I have mentioned to have left us in the night; they edged towards us, imagining we were Spaniards, by which means we got them again. The two fellows in her were almo&s;t dead, having ate or drank nothing for three days, and had ju&s;t been a&s;hore on a &s;mall i&s;land, to kill &s;eals to drink their blood. They had no excu&s;e for them&s;elves, but that they fell a&s;leep, and the faint breezes of the night had wafted us in the bark away from them.</P>
<P>Pi&s;co being 40 leagues to the windward of Callao, I kept clo&s;e hauled till I had gained a two degrees offing, and kept that di&s;tance till we had got well to the northward of Callao, and hauled in again for the land, a little to the &s;outh|ward of Truxillo, and looked into the roads of Guanchaco, Malabriga, and Cheripe; but, &s;ee|ing no &s;hip at tho&s;e places, I pa&s;&s;ed between the i&s;land of Lobos de Tierra and the continent; and, Nov. 25, found our&s;elves near the Saddle of Payta, where having made &s;ome pri&s;oners, I examined them concerning the condition of the town, which they an&s;wered was very poor at pre|&s;ent, there being neither money nor provi&s;ions in it, and &s;hewed me a &s;mall bark on the &s;hore, which Captain Clipperton had &s;ent in here a little while before with &s;ome of his pri&s;oners, which had given them &s;uch an alarm, that every thing had been again removed into the country. This
<PB N="192" REF="198">
unwelcome news did not hinder us from keep|ing on our way, with our Spani&s;h colours flying, till we came to the place of anchorage.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was our anchor down than I &s;ent away Mr. Brooks, with both the boats, armed with 24 men; no more of them, however, ap|peared than tho&s;e who rowed, and two or three &s;itters in each, the re&s;t, with their arms, lying in the bottom of the boat. Thus they advanced towards the town, without giving the lea&s;t um|brage to the inhabitants, who were &s;o thoroughly per&s;uaded of our being Spaniards, that, when the people landed, they found the children playing on the beach, who were the fir&s;t that took the alarm, and ran away at the &s;ight of armed men. In an in&s;tant the whole place was in confu&s;ion; the town was de&s;erted, and nothing left in it but a few bales of coar&s;e cloth, about 500 of dried tole or dog-fi&s;h, two or three pedlars packs, and an incon&s;iderable quantity of bread and &s;weet|meats; &s;o that we unluckily had but little em|ployment for our boats.</P>
<P>As we lay at an anchor in the &s;hip, we took a boat with about fifty jars of Peruvian wine and brandy, the ma&s;ter of which told us, he was come by &s;tealth from Callao, there being orders that none but &s;hips of &s;ome force &s;hould &s;tir out. This man was the fir&s;t who acquainted me with Captain Hatley's being taken, and the value of his prizes; and likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured me, that, if Captain Clipperton had landed the fir&s;t time he was here, there were 400,000 pieces of eight in
<PB N="193" REF="199">
it, be&s;ides a great quantity of je&s;uits bark, and other valuable commodities, of all which he might ea&s;ily have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter; but he wanted courage. Some of the King of Spain's trea&s;ure is frequently lodged under the Governor's care; and, if he had made an attempt, even the &s;econd time, it would have been worth his while. As for Collan, which is two miles to the north|ward of this, &s;ituated near the mouth of a little river, it is a mean place, being entirely inhabit|ed by Indians.</P>
<P>From this place we directed our cour&s;e for the i&s;land of Gorgona, in the bay of Panama, and in our pa&s;&s;age thither built a tank, or wooden ci&s;tern, big enough to hold 10 tons of water, wherewith to &s;upply our want of ca&s;ks, as without the help of &s;ome &s;uch contrivance we &s;hould have but little hopes of being ever able to return home. In our way we made the i&s;land of Plate, Cape St. Francis, and Gorgonella; and on Dec. 2, we came to anchor to the leeward of the northernmo&s;t point of Gorgona, within le&s;s than a quarter of a mile of the &s;hore. Here we had the advantage of filling our water-ca&s;ks in the boat, the water running in &s;mall &s;treams into the &s;ea, and cut down our wood at high water mark; &s;o that in le&s;s than 48 hours we had done our bu&s;ine&s;s here, and hurried away to &s;ea, for fear of tho&s;e who might be in que&s;t of us.</P>
<P>Having got out of the track of the enemies &s;hips, we con&s;ulted on the be&s;t methods of pro|ceeding, when the majority were for going di|rectly
<PB N="194" REF="200">
over to the coa&s;ts of A&s;ia. Upon this we changed our &s;hip's name from the Je&s;us Maria to the Happy Return, and applied all our en|deavours towards abandoning the&s;e coa&s;ts; but the winds and currents were aver&s;e to it; and &s;ome of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed our departure, did &s;o much damage clande&s;tinely to our tank, that the greate&s;t part of our water leaked out. This, to|gether with continual contrary winds and dead calms, which detained us till our provi&s;ions were much exhau&s;ted, rendered us incapable to un|dertake &s;o long a run; and therefore, to furni&s;h our&s;elves with what we wanted, I propo&s;ed a de|&s;cent on the i&s;land of Quibo, in lat. 7 deg. 40 min. N. where, by Captain Rogers's account, I gue&s;&s;ed there mu&s;t be inhabitants who lived in a plentiful manner on the product of the country.</P>
<P>On January 13, 1721, we anchored between Quibo and the i&s;le of Quivetta, in a &s;andy bay, commodious for wooding and watering. The morning after our arrival, we &s;aw two large pi|raguas rowing in for the i&s;le of Quivetta, one of them with Spani&s;h colours flying; and, after a little debate, whether it would be prudent for us to attack them in our boat or not, it was re|&s;olved, at all hazards, to go after them in our yaul. This enterprize was commanded by Mr. Brooks, our Fir&s;t Lieutenant, who found the men on &s;hore, brought away their piraguas, and two pri&s;oners, the one a Mulatto, and the other a Negro; the re&s;t &s;ought for refuge in the woods. The Mulatto mortified us very much, by telling
<PB N="195" REF="201">
us, that a ve&s;&s;el laden with provi&s;ions had pa&s;&s;|ed by very near us in the night; but, to make amends, promi&s;ed to conduct us to a place where we might &s;upply our&s;elves without any hazard, provided we were not above two or three days about it. No news could be more welcome to us than this, wherefore we were very bri&s;k in getting off our wood and water; and, on Janu|ary the 19th, we got &s;afe in between Mariato and the i&s;land of Sebaco, and anchored in &s;ix fathom water, over again&s;t a green field, which is in|&s;truction &s;ufficient, there being but that clear &s;pot hereabouts. Our guide de&s;ired we might be going at lea&s;t three hours before day-light, and that then we &s;hould be in good time at the plantations. Accordingly I embarked at two the next morning in our own boat, and ordered the two lieutenants in the two piraguas, leaving my &s;on and a few men with him, to take care of the &s;hip. Our guide carried us up &s;ome part of the river St. Martin, and out of that into &s;everal branches of very narrow creeks among&s;t man|groves, where we had not room to row, which made me &s;u&s;pect he had no good de&s;ign in his head; but we landed ju&s;t at day-break on a fine &s;avannah, or plain; and, after a march of about three miles, came to two farm-hou&s;es, who&s;e owners had made their e&s;cape, except the wife and children of one hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The place an&s;wered the man's de&s;cription, being &s;urrounded by numerous herds of black cattle, hogs, and plenty of fowls of all &s;orts;
<PB N="196" REF="202">
and here we found &s;ome dried beef, plantains, and Indian corn; and, for pre&s;ent u&s;e, were en|tertained with a whol&s;ome breakfa&s;t of hot cake and milk, a diet we had been long unacquainted with When it came to be broad day, I &s;aw our &s;hip clo&s;e by us, upon which I a&s;ked our Mu|latto, How he came to bring us &s;o far about? He an&s;wered, There was a river between us, and he did not know whether it was fordable or not. I therefore &s;ent &s;ome to try, who found it was not above knee deep. Wherefore, to avoid the trouble of carrying our plunder &s;o far as we had been led, I ordered our boats to row out of the river St. Martin, and to come to the beach over again&s;t the &s;hip. We had not been long here before the ma&s;ter of the family we were with, being anxious for their &s;afety, returned, and made an offer of as many of his black cattle as we &s;hould think &s;it to require; which offer we kindly received: and he brought us the number we thought we could &s;ave; for, hav|ing but little &s;alt, and not being able to &s;pare water to keep them alive when at &s;ea, our de|mands were moderate; and the few we requir|ed, as &s;oon as they were carried on board, were k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ed. Their fle&s;h we pre&s;erved by cutting it into long &s;lips of the thickne&s;s of a finger, and then &s;prinkling it with &s;o &s;mall a quantity of &s;alt, that we did not u&s;e above four or five pounds to a hundred weight; then letting it he together two or three hours, we hung it up to dry in the &s;un, which perfectly cured it, and
<PB N="197" REF="203">
that better than it could have been done by any other way.</P>
<P>Having done all we propo&s;ed in coming here, we departed with our decks full of fowls and hogs, among&s;t which there was one with its navel, or &s;omething like it, on its back. The Spaniards &s;ay, that this, when wild in the woods, is a terrible animal to meet with, although at full growth it be but &s;mall.</P>
<P>January 25, we made a &s;ail about two leagues to the leeward of us: we gave her chace till we found &s;he was of European &s;tructure; and fear|ing &s;he might be one of the enemy's &s;hips of war, I clapped on a wind, and in half an hour's time it fell calm. Soon after, we &s;aw a boat rowing towards us, which proved to be the Suc|ce&s;s's pinnace, commanded by Mr. David&s;on, their Fir&s;t Lieutenant. My fir&s;t interview with him was attended by an a&s;toni&s;hment equal on both &s;ides; he could hardly believe that he &s;aw us in &s;o mean and forlorn a condition; and I could &s;carce believe that the Succe&s;s (if in being) had been all this while wandering up and down the&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>I entertained him with a rehear&s;al of the con|&s;tant run of misfortunes which had befallen us in the long interval &s;ince we &s;eparated near the coa&s;t of England, till our pre&s;ent meeting that day; and he, on his part, entertained me with &s;everal remarkable incidents, which had happened to them in the cour&s;e of their voyage. Particularly, he told me, that, about a twelve-month
<PB N="198" REF="204">
before, they had taken a new French-built brigantine, and put their officers and &s;hip's company's plunder on board of her, which they valued at ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; that their &s;econd Captain, Mr. Mitchel, was in|tru&s;ted with the command of her, and was or|dered to go to &s;ome i&s;land on the coa&s;t of Mexico, and to &s;tay there till Captain Clipper|ton &s;hould join him with his &s;hip; but that they never could find the i&s;land &s;ince, and, therefore, judged that poor Mitchel, and his men, were either &s;tarved, or murdered by the Spaniards or Indians, or that he had peri&s;hed with the i&s;land, &s;uch &s;ubmer&s;ions being frequent on tho&s;e coa&s;ts. The &s;tory of Captain Mitchel, who was a very worthy man, and an expert &s;ailor, is, in all its circum&s;tances, a very tragi|cal one. There was always a jealou&s;y between him and his Captain, who ordered him to a place, and pretended to give him infallible di|rections to find it, which never could be found afterwards, and, tis my opinion, never was above water; and the unfortunate gentleman, without doubt, peri&s;hed in &s;ome ob&s;cure, mi&s;erable man|ner, in que&s;t of a place that was never yet, and perhaps never may be di&s;covered. In our di&s;|cour&s;e, I a&s;ked Mr. David&s;on the value of the booty they had made, and he a&s;&s;ured me it did not exceed 70,000 dollars&mdash;but that they had lo&s;t great opportunities&mdash;that in October, 1720, they were in the bay of Conception, and had the misfortune to leave three laden &s;hips
<PB N="199" REF="205">
behind them, and mi&s;&s;ed a fourth, which was coming into the bay, and which was &s;o near as to hail and talk to them, be&s;ides being becalmed by them;&mdash;that though it was probable their launch could have taken them all four, yet, through their Captain's deafne&s;s to advice, they took none of them:&mdash;that, moreover, they had never yet cleaned their bottom, notwith&s;tanding they had had it in their power to do it; and that this negligence had like to have co&s;t them dear; for that, in their return from Conception, they looked into Coquimbo, where they &s;aw five &s;hips at anchor, three of which let &s;lip after them, and overtook them apace, but by the favour of thick weather, and a hard gale of wind, they got clear of them; and further, that, off the port of Callao, they fell in with the Flying-fi&s;h frigate, which was crui&s;ing for me in the bark, and which, by unpardonable mi&s;management on the part of Clipperton, got &s;afe from them, although deeply laden with a valuable cargo de&s;igned for Cadiz. I have been &s;ince informed of this by one of my &s;urgeon's mates, who was taken in the Mercury, and was &s;urgeon of the Flying-fi&s;h at that time.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of my di&s;cour&s;e with Mr. David&s;on, when, in the mean time, a gale &s;prung up, which interrupted us, and I bore down to the Succe&s;s, and went on board of her. I gave Captain Clipperton, and Mr. Godfrey, the agent-general, the whole hi&s;tory of my voyage hitherto, and expected that I &s;hould
<PB N="200" REF="206">
have been treated by them as one belonging to the &s;ame intere&s;t, but found I was mi&s;taken; for they were unwilling to have any thing to do with me &s;ince my &s;hip was lo&s;t. However, I conceived, that he could not be &s;o inhuman, as to deny me the &s;upply of &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as I wanted, and he could conveniently &s;pare. The an&s;wer I had to this was, that I &s;hould know more of his mind the next day. Among&s;t the re&s;t of the di&s;cour&s;e I had with him, he told me he was ju&s;t come from the i&s;land of Cocos, that his people were &s;ickly, and at very &s;hort allowance. Upon this, I offered my &s;ervice to pilot him to Mariato, which was not above thirty leagues di&s;tant from us, where he might have refre&s;hed his people, and &s;upplied him&s;elf with what he would. But this was not accepted, he being re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of his way to the Tres Marias, where, he &s;aid, there was tur|tle enough to be had; &s;o I left him for that night.</P>
<P>The next morning, as I was going on board of him again, with &s;ome of my officers, he &s;ud|denly &s;pread all his canvas, and crouded away from us, who were in the boat: upon which I returned to our &s;hip again, and made &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s, and fired our gun &s;everal times, which was not regarded by him, till his very officers cried out on his barbarity, and, at la&s;t, he brought to. When I had &s;ailed up with him, (being exa&s;perated at &s;uch inhuman treat|ment) I &s;ent Mr. Brooks, our Fir&s;t Lieutenant,
<PB N="201" REF="207">
to know the rea&s;on of his abrupt departure, and to tell him that we &s;tood in need of &s;everal ne|ce&s;&s;aries, which, if he was not inclined to give, I would purcha&s;e of him. Upon the&s;e terms he &s;pared me two of his quarter-deck guns, &s;ixty round &s;hot, &s;ome mu&s;quet-balls and flints, and a Spani&s;h chart of the coa&s;t of Mexico and part of India and China, a half-hour, and a half-minute gla&s;s, a compa&s;s, and about 300 weight of &s;alt; but with all the arguments I could u&s;e, I could not prevail on him to &s;pare us the lea&s;t thing out of his &s;urgeon's che&s;t for the relief of Mr. Cold|&s;ea, our ma&s;ter, who had been ready to die of his wounds received in the engagement with the Margarita, for above three months pa&s;t. When this was concluded, I again a&s;ked him, if I could be of any &s;ervice to him, and a&s;&s;ured him, I had a pretty good &s;hip under foot, though &s;he made but a poor figure, and believed I could hold him way, and that he knew our cargo was pretty valuable. To all this he an&s;wered, that, if I had a cargo of gold, he had no bu&s;ine&s;s with me, and that I mu&s;t take care of my&s;elf. Mr. Hendry, the agent, and Mr. Rainer and Mr. Dodd, Lieu|tenants of marines, &s;eeing but little pro&s;pect that we &s;hould ever get home, and being weary of the work that was impo&s;ed upon them, de&s;ired I would let them go on board the Succe&s;s, for a pa&s;&s;age to England; which I con&s;enting to, they went on board accordingly, and Clipperton left us to &s;hift for our&s;elves, near the i&s;land of Cano. Having purcha&s;ed this &s;upply, I was for going to
<PB N="202" REF="208">
the &s;outhward into the bay of Panama, to try our fortune there; but the majority oppo&s;ed me through fear, and were for going to the Tres Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">as, to &s;alt turtle there, and then &s;tretch over for India. We directed our cour&s;e thither; and, a few days after, met with the Succe&s;s in que&s;t of Son&s;onnate, where they expected to receive the Marquis of Villa Roche's ran&s;om. That noble|man had been &s;ome time a pri&s;oner with them, and his wife was now at Guatimali, a city within 30 leagues of that port. We ranged clo&s;e under their &s;tern, and a&s;ked how Captain Clipperton and the re&s;t of the gentlemen did, but it was not thought proper to return any an&s;wer; &s;o without any concern, he &s;teered one way, and we another. After this, calms, and contrary winds, and unaccountable currents, reduced us to a very &s;mall allowance, which we were oblig|ed to dimini&s;h daily, and &s;hould have been in deeper di&s;tre&s;s than ever, had it not been for the turtle which we took on the &s;urface of the wa|ter. We had a continual look-out for them, and they were ea&s;ily known, at a great di&s;tance, by the number of &s;ea-birds that perched on their backs. Upon &s;ight of the&s;e, we u&s;ed to lay a&s;ide the advantages we might have made of the wind, to embrace the opportunity of prolonging our provi&s;ions. Upon the whole, though we lo&s;t &s;ome of our way in pur&s;uit of turtle after this manner, it was not the greate&s;t inconvenience that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">tended us; the dre&s;&s;ing it made a great con&s;umption of our water, the quantity of which
<PB N="203" REF="209">
decrea&s;ed upon us very &s;uddenly, by the conti|nual u&s;e of it in boiling the turtle with plantain flower. This relap&s;e into a &s;tate of famine, threatening us with &s;peedy and certain perdition, if means were not u&s;ed to avert it, made me propo&s;e the plundering of &s;ome &s;mall town as we coa&s;ted along the &s;hore. Guatulco was the neare&s;t to us: but the very morning we were &s;teering in for this place, at &s;un-ri&s;ing we &s;aw a &s;ail a con&s;iderable way to leeward of us. We thought it would be better to take this &s;hip than to venture on &s;hore, and therefore we bore down to her, who in the end proved to be the Succe&s;s. We now met with a double baulk, both as to our hopes of Guatulco and the &s;hip; for we were by this accident got &s;o far to the leeward of Guatulco, that it was needle&s;s to beat up &s;o far again&s;t the wind for an uncertainty, when we had a gale, that, had it continued, would have carried us to &s;ome better port.</P>
<P>But the winds were but a few hours propi|tious, and were &s;ucceeded by perpetual con|trary gales, which de&s;troyed all our hopes, and brought us down to a &s;mall earthen plate of ca|lavances, a kind of &s;mall bean, for 24 hours, which not being &s;ufficient to keep us alive, we had recour&s;e to the remainder of our &s;moked congers, which had for &s;ome months been neg|lected, and lain &s;oaking and rotting in the bulge water. They were certainly as di&s;agree|able food as ever men eat.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e calamitous circum&s;tances did we
<PB N="204" REF="210">
meet with the Succe&s;s a fourth time, near the port of Angels; and, after having made the ap|pointed &s;ignal, we &s;tood &s;o near to one another, that, to u&s;e the &s;ea phra&s;e, a bi&s;ket might have been to&s;&s;ed from &s;hip to &s;hip, but we did not change a word with each other; for, Captain Clipperton, as I have &s;ince been informed, had ordered all his officers and &s;hip's company to take no notice of us: and, though he was &s;o truly &s;en&s;ible of the difficulties and hazards we had to cope with, if our de&s;ign was to go for India, that he &s;aid, The child that was born the day before would be grey headed with age be|fore we &s;hould arrive there (intimating by that expre&s;&s;ion, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to do it), yet, notwith&s;tanding, he, without any remor&s;e, could &s;ee us on the brink of &s;uffering the great|e&s;t &s;everities our ill fortune could load us with, and not lend us a helping hand to deliver us from the impending ruin.</P>
<P>Thus &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by pre&s;ent want and threatening di&s;a&s;ters, we, on the 12th of March, being off the port of Acapulco, &s;aw a &s;hip between us and the &s;hore. I bore down to her, till perceiving her to be a large Europe-built &s;hip, with Spani&s;h colours flying, I con|cluded &s;he was the Peregrine, who, as I had been informed, had carried the Prince of St. Bu|eno, who had been Viceroy of Peru, to this port in his way to Spain. With the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, be|ing as yet unwilling to run our&s;elves &s;o immedi|ately into the enemy's clutches, I hauled again
<PB N="205" REF="211">
on a wind, which he &s;eeing, he pulled down his Spani&s;h, and hoi&s;ted an Engli&s;h en&s;ign, and made the &s;ignal agred on between Clipperton and me for knowing one another. Had they been in any other part, I &s;hould have been &s;o far from enter|taining any thoughts of &s;uch a change in him, that I &s;hould have looked on all his &s;ignals as the artifices of the enemy, who might have ac|quainted them&s;elves with them by the informa|tion of &s;uch of our men as they might have taken pri&s;oners. But now, making no doubt that it was he, I bore down to him, and being come along his &s;ide, he &s;ent Captain Cook, his &s;econd Lieutenant, in his yaul, with an obliging letter to me, to inform me, he was crui&s;ing for the homeward-bound Manilla &s;hip, and de&s;iring I would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the enterprize, and come on board of him the next morning, propo&s;ing a union of our two &s;hip's companies. I was very well plea&s;ed with this offer, and, without he&s;ita|tion, returned him word that I would be with him early.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I read over his letter pub|licly to my people, and exhorted them &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of the great benefits that would ac|crue to us on all &s;ides from it. Upon which they all expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t re&s;igned willingne&s;s to join in the undertaking. But, as Clipperton had u&s;ed us &s;o unhand&s;omely before, they de&s;ired I would get &s;ome &s;ecurity for their &s;hares, &s;igned by Cap|tain Clipperton, Mr. Godfrey the agent, and the re&s;t of their officers. I went on board, and, ac|cording
<PB N="206" REF="212">
to their reque&s;t, Capt. Clipperton, and Mr. Godfrey, the owners agent, immediately drew up an in&s;trument fully worded for the purpo&s;e, and they and all the other officers &s;igned it. This was all my people wanted to make them ea&s;y.</P>
<P>We then proceeded upon our main bu&s;ine&s;s; and, after mature deliberation, it was thought mo&s;t advi&s;eable, that I &s;hould &s;end the greate&s;t part of my men on board the Succe&s;s, as &s;oon as we &s;aw the Manilla &s;hip come out of Acapulco, and leave only a boat's crew with me to bring me away, in ca&s;e I &s;hould have occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of my &s;hip as a fire-&s;hip, or a &s;moaker, which we jointly propo&s;ed to do, if we found the ene|my too hard for us; and it was determined to board her at once, as we &s;hould otherwi&s;e have much the wor&s;t of it, on account of their &s;uperior weight of metal, and the better capa|city of their &s;hips, which are built very &s;trong, to bear a cannonading. Clipperton a&s;&s;ured me, he was certain of the time when &s;he would &s;ail from this port, which the Spaniards &s;ay is always within a day or two after Pa&s;&s;ion-week, of which we had a fortnight yet to come.</P>
<P>Before I returned to my own &s;hip, I acquaint|ed Captain Clipperton with our &s;lender &s;tock of provi&s;ions, but particularly with our &s;hortne&s;s of water; and he told me he had 80 tons of it on board, and he would &s;pare me as much of it as I would have, or any thing el&s;e his &s;hip afforded.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="213">I had now the plea&s;ure of being re&s;tored to my command in as regular a manner as ever; every one, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, ex|pre&s;&s;ing the &s;atisfaction he had in the pro&s;pect before us. But Morphew, that ringleader of all our di&s;orders, fearing my re&s;entment, thought it was his be&s;t way, to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the favour of the Captain and Officers of the Suc|ce&s;s, which he did effectually, by an humble, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, outward deportment, and prevailing pre&s;ents. In &s;hort, he had his end, and left me; but, the next morning, Mr. Rainer, who acted with us afterwards as Captain of marines, came on board of us to vi&s;it his old &s;hipmates, and &s;o continued.</P>
<P>Thus we crui&s;ed in good order, and with a great deal of hope, until March 17, when, to|wards evening, Clipperton, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, &s;tretched a-head of us about two leagues, without lowering &s;o much as a top-gallant-&s;ail for us to come up with him. I could not but be a little &s;tartled at this, as being quite contrary to his u&s;ual method. However, I kept &s;tanding after him, as I thought, in the night, till we were almo&s;t in the breakers on the &s;hore, which of cour&s;e obliged us to tack, and &s;tand out to &s;ea again, admiring all the time that we had had no &s;ignal for going about. The next morn|ing we had no &s;ight of any &s;hip near us, which laid me under the mo&s;t terrible apprehen&s;ions, con&s;idering the bad condition we were in for want of water, and the va&s;t di&s;tance we were at
<PB N="208" REF="214">
from any place where we could expect to get a recruit of any, having now no choice left, but either to beat up 220 leagues again&s;t the wind, to go to the Tres Marias, or bear away a much more con&s;iderable di&s;tance for the gulph of Amapala, or the i&s;land of Cocos.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding our di&s;tre&s;s, I kept our crui&s;ing &s;tation for him two or three days. At la&s;t it was re&s;olved to bear away to the fir&s;t con|venient place to water at; and, in truth, it was time, for we were now 40 odd men, who had but three buts of water for a run of 300 leagues and upwards, on a coa&s;t &s;ubject to long calms, variable winds, and uncertain currents.</P>
<P>It was afterwards told me, that the night Clipperton left us, he a&s;&s;embled all his officers, and told them it was his intention immediately to quit the coa&s;t. His officers remon&s;trated to him on the barbarity of doing this without ac|quainting Captain Shelvock with his intention, and &s;paring us &s;ome water. But he put off their &s;erious expo&s;tulations with an inhuman &s;neer, &s;aying, That, if I &s;hould, through want, be obliged to &s;urrender to the enemy, I &s;hould only &s;hare the &s;ame fate, that, perhaps, &s;ome others had met with before me.</P>
<P>Thus this man, perhaps, through an exce&s;s of mean-&s;piritedne&s;s, and dreading the engage|ment with a &s;hip that was always known to de|fend it&s;elf with &s;ome ob&s;tinacy, neglected as fine an opportunity as mo&s;t of our nation have ever had of taking this &s;hip, which, as I was informed,
<PB N="209" REF="215" MS="y">
by &s;ome Spaniards from Manilla, when I was in China, came out of Acapulco about a week after we left the cruize&mdash;[For Capt. Clipperton's ac|count of this tran&s;action we refer the reader to the preceding voyage.]</P>
<P>On March 30, in the evening, we entered the road of Son&s;onnate, and, as the &s;un &s;et, &s;aw a &s;hip at anchor there. It being a moon-light night, I &s;ent the fir&s;t Lieutenant, with &s;ome of the be&s;t hands, to di&s;cover what this &s;hip might be. On his return he informed me, the &s;hip was a large one, of one tier of guns at lea&s;t. I neverthele&s;s continued to ply in all the night, and prepared for action. At day-light we found they had hoi&s;ted a jar of powder, con|taining about ten gallons, with lighted match, at each main and fore yard arm, and at the bow&s;prit end, with de&s;ign to let them fall on our decks if we boarded them. This contri|vance, if it had taken effect, would have &s;oon made an end of both &s;hips, and of all that were in them. Seeing them &s;o de&s;perate in their pre|parations, I expected a warm di&s;pute with them; and, by what I could &s;ee, they were, in all points, &s;uperior by much to us in &s;trength.</P>
<P>At eleven in the morning, the &s;ea-breeze came in, and ran us upon them very fa&s;t, whil&s;t our &s;mall arms were bri&s;kly and effectually em|ployed to break their powder jars, before we came to board them, which we did without de|lay, and, after the exchange of a few &s;hot when on board of each other, they &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="216">This &s;hip was called the Sacra Familia, of 300 tons, &s;ix guns, and 70 men; be&s;ides a great number of &s;mall arms, with &s;ome grenade &s;hells and &s;hot. She had been, for &s;ome time before, arrived from Callao, with wine and brandy; but had now nothing in her but fifty jars of gunpowder, and a &s;mall parcel of ru&s;k and jerked beef. In &s;hort, &s;he could hardly be &s;aid to be worth the trouble we took, and the ri&s;ques we ran for her: but &s;he was reputed to be a better &s;ailor, and was vi&s;ibly better fitted out than our own; wherefore I changed &s;hips, and we all went on board our prize, which was equipped in the warlike manner we found her, and commi&s;&s;ioned, on purpo&s;e to take us.</P>
<P>A merchant, the e&s;crivan of the &s;hip, being On board, de&s;ired we would &s;ell him the Je&s;us Maria, which we agreed to, and &s;ent him on &s;hore to rai&s;e the money for that purpo&s;e; and at night he came off with another Spani&s;h gen|tleman, and brought us a letter of advice from the Governor on &s;hore, &s;ignifying that there was a treaty of peace on foot between their Bri|tannic and Catholic Maje&s;ties, which was what we had not before heard of. However, I &s;ent to the Governor, &s;ignifying that I &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee the proclamation and articles; and that thereupon, I &s;hould be ready to obey the commands of my Sovereign; &s;o we came to an agreement with the Governor to lye in the road till he &s;ent to Guatimala, 50 leagues di&s;|tant, for tho&s;e papers, provided he would &s;up|ply
<PB N="211" REF="217">
us with water and provi&s;ions. On the 5th of April, the Governor &s;ent on board two papers, which, by the be&s;t interpretation we could get of them, did not appear to us to be in the form of proclamations. We told tho&s;e who brought the papers aboard, that we were in great want of an interpreter; upon which they &s;aid, there were &s;ome Engli&s;hmen at Guati|mala, whom they would &s;end for, if we would &s;tay three days for them, and that they would &s;upply us with water and provi&s;ions till that time; which we agreed to, and they de&s;ired we would &s;end our boat on &s;hore every morning for the &s;upply. Accordingly, on the 7th of April, we &s;ent our boat on &s;hore with Mr. Brooks, our fir&s;t Lieutenant, and five men. This officer, men, and boat, the Governor detained under a flag of truce, and, at night, &s;ent off a &s;mall boat, with two of our men, with a letter from him&s;elf, and another from Mr. Brooks. His letter &s;ignified, that, if we did not deliver up our &s;hip to him, he would declare us pirates. And Mr. Brooks, by his, informed me, that it was his opinion, that the Governor was endea|vouring to bully me into a &s;urrender, having &s;poken very ambiguou&s;ly of a ce&s;&s;ation of arms: notwith&s;tanding which, I &s;ent the Governor a letter, &s;ignifying, that, if we could be &s;ecured of a &s;afe and &s;ure conduct for our&s;elves and ef|fects to Panama, and from thence, by the way of Porto Bello, be conveyed to any of our Briti&s;h plantations, we would come to a farther
<PB N="212" REF="218">
treaty; which if he intended, he was de&s;ired to &s;ignify it by firing two guns as &s;oon as he had received this advice, and by &s;ending back my officer and men; if not, nece&s;&s;ity would oblige us to &s;ail. At three in the morning, (the Governor having &s;hewn no &s;ignal, nor &s;ent any word) we weighed our anchor, yet lay to in the bay till ten, but then made &s;ail, being forced thereto for want of water; having, however, no other in|tent, in ca&s;e of the certainty of a peace, than to deliver up the &s;hip we were now in at the fir&s;t convenient port, as was &s;ignified to the Go|vernor by letter.</P>
<P>Being now got out to &s;ea, we reduced our|&s;elves to a pint of water for 24 hours each man, and directed our cour&s;e for the gulph of Ama|pala, which was about 35 leagues to the E.S.E. of this place, in order to get a fre&s;h &s;upply. The lo&s;s of my officer and boat's crew, &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed the number of white faces, and we &s;hould have been &s;o much weakened by it, that we &s;hould never have been able to manage this great &s;hip, with her heavy cotton &s;ails, if we had not taken with us our negro pri&s;oners, who proved to be very good &s;ailors. The lo&s;s of our boat was al&s;o a very great inconvenience to us; but as I only thought of taking water enough to carry us to Panama, where we were fully re&s;olved to &s;urrender, if it was really peace, I imagined we might make &s;hift without her, and get &s;uch a quantity as we might want in two or three days time.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="219">The winds were favourable, and we arrived there on the tenth following in the evening. As &s;oon as we had entered the gulph we found our|&s;elves in the mid&s;t of &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, one of which was the i&s;land of Tygers, where we expected to find water; but our expectations proved vain, for, after a hazardous and fruitle&s;s &s;earch not only on that, but on &s;ome of the greene&s;t of the other i&s;les, there was not the lea&s;t drop of fre&s;h water to be found, by us, on any of them.</P>
<P>In this mi&s;erable condition, threatened on all &s;ides with inevitable de&s;truction, unfit for the &s;ea, fearful of tru&s;ting our&s;elves in the cruel hands of the inhabitants on the &s;hore, quite di&s;|pirited by the continued cour&s;e of misfortunes which had hitherto been our con&s;tant atten|dants; but, above all, lamenting this unhappy baulk in not finding water where we &s;o much expected it, which had reduced us to &s;uch extre|mities as we had never known before; in &s;hort, ready to &s;ink under the burden of our calami|ties, we weighed our anchor on the 13th of April before day-break, and &s;tood out from this gulph. And now having the open &s;ea be|fore us, I brought my people in general to an ob&s;tinate re&s;olution not to &s;urrender on this part of the coa&s;t, let the con&s;equences be ever &s;o mi&s;erable. Upon this unanimous agreement, with not 40 gallons of water in the &s;hip, and no other liquids to &s;upply the want of it, we came to &s;o &s;mall an allowance as half a pint of
<PB N="214" REF="220">
water for 24 hours; and even this allowance was rather too large, there being no place, that we knew of, where we could get any more, nearer than Quibo, to which i&s;land, about 200 leagues di&s;tant from us, we &s;haped our cour&s;e, but having very uncertain winds and weather, we were 13 days at this allowance. Our &s;uffer|ings from the extremity of thir&s;t are hardly to be conceived; &s;ome drank their own water to allay the burning heat within them, but though this moi&s;tened their mouths, it increa&s;ed their mi&s;ery; &s;ome drank large draughts of &s;ea-water, which was near putting a period to their lives; while others eat ju&s;t enough of the calavances moi&s;tened with water to &s;u&s;tain life, and the&s;e &s;uffered the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>At length we were fortunately relieved, by falling in unexpectedly with the i&s;land of Cano, in lat. 9 deg. N. where &s;eeing a run of water, Mr. Randall, without dreading the dangerous &s;urf, pa&s;&s;ed through the breakers, and, to the un&s;peak|able joy of all the company, &s;oon returned on board with his jars filled; but as he could not bring off more than 60 or 70 gallons, I took care to re&s;train our people in the u&s;e of it, allow|ing to each man only a quart for their imme|diate u&s;e: and I was the more &s;trict in this di&s;tri|bution, becau&s;e Mr. Randall a&s;&s;ured me, the breakers were &s;o dangerous, that he believed we &s;hould not be able to get at any more.</P>
<P>Being willing, however, to make another trial, I next day &s;ent the boat&s;wain, to endeavour to
<PB N="215" REF="221">
procure a further &s;upply; but, after wa&s;ting the whole day in &s;earch of a &s;mooth beach to land upon, he could not &s;ee one &s;pot where he dur&s;t venture on &s;hore. Therefore, thinking we had a &s;tock &s;ufficient to carry us to Quibo, I weigh|ed anchor, and in ranging the i&s;land I acciden|tally di&s;covered a &s;mooth beach, where the lit|tle boat getting on &s;hore, the crew filled nine jars, which la&s;ted till we arrived at Quibo, where we anchored at the &s;ame place we had twice an|chored at before. Here we con&s;ulted about &s;ur|rendering our&s;elves to the Spaniards, being within 80 leagues of Panama, a place of little or no &s;trength towards the &s;ea, and but little frequented by the enemy's &s;hips of war, where we could treat with them at a di&s;tance, and be truly informed how affairs &s;tood in Europe. During our deliberations we wooded and wa|tered at lei&s;ure; and &s;ome &s;earched the woods for fruits to refre&s;h us, by way of prevention again&s;t the &s;curvy, which we had been all along le&s;s &s;ubject to than any &s;hip I ever &s;aw or heard of in &s;uch long runs. Tho&s;e who were thus u&s;efully employed brought us papas, guayavas, ca&s;&s;ia, limes, and a &s;mall kind of white &s;our plumb, which was much eaten and admired by mo&s;t of us; but, by its violent operation, it put a &s;top to our proceedings for &s;ome days. How|ever, we &s;oon recovered, without any bad &s;ymp|toms, and made an end of wooding and water|ing, and &s;et &s;ail, fully determined to &s;urrender at Panama.

<P>May 15, a &s;mall bark, taking us for Spaniards, bore down to us, the ma&s;ter of which was in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation when he found his mi&s;take, but recovered when he heard we were bound for Panama to &s;urrender, and readily offered his pilot thither, his ve&s;&s;el, called the Holy Sacrament, being bound to that port, laden with dried beef, pork, and live hogs, which, as &s;he was leaky, he de&s;ired that I would take in tow. I was glad this bark fell into our hands, and readily com|plied with his reque&s;t, becau&s;e, if we found the Governor of Son&s;onnate's account to be fal&s;e, we might be thoroughly enabled by this help to go to India. In the mean while, it had remained a point yet undetermined, who &s;hould be the per|&s;on entru&s;ted with the flag of truce; for my peo|ple, having known much treachery, were appre|hen&s;ive the per&s;on &s;ent would only, or chiefly, make good his own ca&s;e and that of his friends to the Governor, and not care what became of the common men. At la&s;t, my &s;on was judged the fitte&s;t to go, as he would &s;urely re|turn, if it were purely for my &s;ake. Other dif|ficulties were &s;tarted that could not &s;o ea&s;ily be removed, notwith&s;tanding which, we kept on our way, fully fixed in our re&s;olution.</P>
<P>May 17, another &s;mall bark came down upon us, but having &s;tood pretty near to us, &s;he bore away again, and ran on &s;hore directly, at the ha|zard
<PB N="217" REF="225">
of the lives of every &s;oul on board. This unaccountable behaviour, gave us good rea&s;on to believe, that the governor of Son&s;onnate's ac|count of a ce&s;&s;ation of arms was groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>May 19, we &s;aw a &s;ail a-head of us, &s;tanding along &s;hore, and being de&s;irous of &s;peaking with her, I let go the bark we had in tow, and made all the &s;ail we could after her. We gained very little upon her all the day; but had, neverthe|le&s;s, got a great way a-head of our bark, wherein were four of our own people and five Spaniards. However, notwith&s;tanding night came on, all our &s;ail was kept abroad, and next morning we were within gun-&s;hot of her. I immediately or|dered our colours to be &s;pread, fired a gun to leeward, and &s;et a man to wave a flag of truce; but, on &s;ight of our Engli&s;h en&s;ign, &s;he fired at us, and &s;o continued to do, with her decks full of men, abu&s;ing us with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t appellations. I made no return until I came clo&s;e upon their quarter, and then I &s;ent one of their countrymen to the bow&s;prit end, to inform them in Spani&s;h, that we were bound to Panama, and de&s;ired to treat peaceably with them, and hoped, at lea&s;t, they would have &s;ome regard to the white flag which they &s;aw flying; but they &s;till continued their fire; and pre&s;uming, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, by our quiet behaviour, that we were unable to defend our&s;elves, they were preparing to board us, which I no &s;ooner perceived than I met them with our helm, and gave them &s;o warm a &s;alute, that they &s;teered round off from us. We ju&s;t mi&s;&s;ed get|ting
<PB N="218" REF="226">
hold of them, but it falling almo&s;t imme|diately calm, we continued our engagement for the &s;pace of two or three hours at the di&s;tance of mu&s;quet-&s;hot. At length, a breeze wafting us nearer to them, we found that as fa&s;t as we ap|proached, &s;o fa&s;t did their courage cool. Their Captain, however, &s;till bravely encouraging his people, and expo&s;ing him&s;elf in the opene&s;t manner, was &s;hot through the body, and drop|ped down dead; upon which they immediately, and with one voice, cried out for quarter, and put an end to the di&s;pute. Mr. Randall, and two or three more, went on board the prize, and found the pri&s;oners in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive po&s;|ture, a&s;king for mercy, which was granted, though they had no great rea&s;on to expect it, after their direct breach of the laws of arms and nations in firing at a flag of truce.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable pri&s;oners, being brought on board, informed me, that their &s;hip, called the Conception de Recova, belonging to Callao, was of the burthen of 200 tons, and laden with flour, loaves of &s;ugar, bales of boxes of malmalade, jars of pre&s;erved peaches, grapes, limes, and the like, mounted &s;ix guns, and had 70 odd men on board. In this engagement, the Spani&s;h Cap|tain and a negroe were killed, and one or two &s;lightly wounded. On our part, our gunner was &s;lightly wounded by a pi&s;tol ball, and our main-ma&s;t had a &s;mall piece carried out of the &s;ide of it. We had now about 80 pri&s;oners of all co|lours, though we our&s;elves were not above 26.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="227">Among&s;t our pri&s;oners we had &s;everal of note, particularly Don Baltazzar de Abarca, Conde de Ro&s;a, an European nobleman, who had beeen Go|vernor of Pi&s;co, and was now upon his return to Spain, together with Captain Morel, who had formerly been taken by Captain Rogers. They were all treated with the utmo&s;t civility, which they the more wondered at, becau&s;e, from a &s;elf-conviction of their own ungenerous behaviour towards us, they could not but expect to have been dealt with quite otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The winds and calms prevented our joining the Holy Sacrament, the prize we had left be|hind us, till May 22, when we bore down to her, and were &s;urprized to find no &s;oul on board, but that her decks and quarters were covered with blood. By many circum&s;tances it plainly ap|peared, that the Spani&s;h crew had butchered tho&s;e who were left to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, while they were a&s;leep; otherwi&s;e it could not have hap|pened, that five unarmed Spaniards could have overpowered four Engli&s;hmen completely pro|vided with arms for their defence. It is very probable, however, that the&s;e murderers paid with their lives, the lo&s;s of tho&s;e lives they had taken away; for, being above four leagues from the land, and having no boat with them, they probably jumped into the &s;ea on our approach, fearing, if they fell into our hands, to meet the vengeance due for &s;o horrid a crime. That part of the deck which was dyed with gore they endea|voured to cover, by throwing the flocks and
<PB N="220" REF="228">
&s;tuffings of beds over it; &s;o that till the&s;e were removed, the blood was not to be &s;een.</P>
<P>This tragical accident put a damp to the plea|&s;ure we had enjoyed for a day or two pa&s;t on the account of our late prize. Our pri&s;oners, at &s;uch a &s;ad and &s;udden change, began to be alarmed, and looked at one another as if they all ex|pected to be the victims of our revenge upon this unhappy occa&s;ion. On the other hand, I was fearful le&s;t the&s;e apprehen&s;ions &s;hould urge them to &s;ome de&s;perate attempt, they being 80 in number, and we not above 17 on board of our own &s;hip, and, when we were all together, not above 25 that could &s;tand to arms. In this dilemma, I ordered all the pri&s;oners into the &s;tern gallery, except the nobleman, and &s;ome of the chief officers, and a guard to be kept in the great cabbin.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h gentlemen ob&s;erving this, let fall &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions whereby I perceived they were afraid I intended to proceed to &s;everities towards their people; but I a&s;&s;ured them, that, if I was of &s;o revengeful a nature, the laws of my coun|try forbad me from indulging it; that I acted under my King's commi&s;&s;ion; and that the na|tural abhorrence our nation had to barbarity, might quiet their fears, and make them perfect|ly ea&s;y. They then, on their part, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner di&s;claimed the very thought of an attempt upon our lives; and a&s;&s;ured us, on their honour, that they thought they &s;hould never be able to make a ju&s;t return for the
<PB N="221" REF="229">
generous treatment they had met with. It was, however, prudent to &s;ecure our pri&s;oners of the meaner &s;ort, and when we had &s;o done, we hauled the Holy Sacrament along-&s;ide of us. She was half full of water, and the greate&s;t part of her dried beef was wet and &s;poiled, but all that was not damaged we took out, together with &s;ome live logs. We al&s;o took out of the Conception a twelvemonth's provi&s;ion of bread, flour, &s;ugar and &s;weetmeats, and a like propor|tion for the Succe&s;s, whom I expected to find at the Tres Marias, being then a &s;tranger to Clip|perton's faithle&s;s de&s;ertion. I likewi&s;e took from them their launch and their negroes; for con&s;idering we had a large &s;hip, and a run of 175 degrees of longitude to &s;ail, which was little le&s;s than half way round the world, I thought we could do no other than reinforce our&s;elves with the&s;e blacks, who are common|ly good &s;ailors in the&s;e parts; and, indeed, we afterwards found we &s;hould never have reached the coa&s;ts of A&s;ia without them.</P>
<P>Thus having &s;upplied our&s;elves with every thing the Conception afforded, I &s;uffered our pri&s;oners to return to their own &s;hip again; but the chief of them would not leave me till they had drawn up a writing, which they &s;igned, whereby they acknowledged the circum&s;tances of our engagement, in the manner I have already related. In &s;hort, no people, circum&s;tanced as we were, could part in a more friendly manner than we did.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="230">Thus were we put by our de&s;ign of &s;urrendering, and were going to undertake a long and hazar|dous voyage to A&s;ia. Our &s;trength was indeed con&s;iderably augmented, for we had now 15 guns, and ammunition enough to &s;upply them.</P>
<P>Before we proceeded any farther, it was nece&s;|&s;ary to get in a full &s;tock of water. The i&s;land of Quibo was hazardous for us, being too near Panama; it was therefore determined to ply up to Cano, where, having a good boat, we &s;oon did our bu&s;ine&s;s. In our pa&s;&s;age thither, the &s;weetmeats of all kinds, which we had taken out of our late prize, were divided among the me&s;&s;es. It happened that one of the fellows, one day, com|plained he had a box of malmalade which he could not &s;tick his knife into, and de&s;ired it might be changed. I opened it, and found in it a cake of virgin &s;ilver, moulded on purpo&s;e to fill &s;uch boxes, and being very porous, it was of near the &s;ame weight of &s;o much mal|malade. In overhauling the re&s;t, we found five more of the&s;e boxes. This was a contrivance to defraud the King of Spain of his fifths, which he claims in all the &s;ilver taken out of any of the mines in Peru. We doubtle&s;s left a great many of the&s;e boxes behind us, &s;o that this de|ceit &s;erved them in a double capacity, to defraud their king's officers, and blind their enemies. An affair as vexatious as this, is &s;aid to have been di&s;covered too late on board a prize the Succe&s;s had taken, where they found a very
<PB N="223" REF="231">
con&s;iderable quantity of Pinna's or virgin &s;ilver, in the form of bricks, very artfully plai&s;tered over with clay, and dried in the &s;un, which be|ing all the con&s;i&s;tence they give their bricks in that country, they were taken to be really &s;uch, and a great number of them were thrown over|board as &s;o much rubbi&s;h, without any di&s;co|very of what they were, till the four or five la&s;t pieces. How true this may be I can't &s;ay, but it was reported to be, as matter of fact, by &s;everal of the officers belonging to Captain Clipperton.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that every thing we took in the Conception was divided among us ac|cording to the Juan Fernandian articles, and that I had no more than &s;ix in&s;tead of &s;ixty &s;hares. They would not &s;o much as allow me the money I had laid out at St. Catherine's, which was upwards of a hundred pounds. I had &s;ome difficulty to per&s;uade them to run to the north|ward &s;o far as California; and was obliged to u&s;e many arguments to prevail upon them to believe that the harbour of Puerto Seguro was the only port of &s;ecurity where we could &s;afe|ly lay down and refit our &s;hip; but having at la&s;t obtained their con&s;ents, I weighed from Cano, &s;teering to the northward, and had fa|vourable gales for 48 hours; but then came on the con&s;tant, or what may be called the trade wind on this coa&s;t, which being as contrary to us as they well could be, I was willing to try how far off the&s;e winds might prevail, which,
<PB N="224" REF="232">
in my opinion, may be called the eddy of the true trade wind, who&s;e cour&s;e may be perverted by the interpo&s;ition of this va&s;t mountainous continent.</P>
<P>Accordingly I found, that, at the di&s;tance of 60 leagues, we had light winds and variable, and that, at the di&s;tance of between 70 and 80 leagues, it &s;ettled at E. N. E. and N. E. I therefore kept at this di&s;tance from the land till we had run up to the height of 20 degrees north. In all this pa&s;&s;age, we were not in the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of any currents, and entirely out of the way of certain riplings and overfalls of wa|ter, which we frequently met with nearer to the land, and which often &s;urprized us when we were becalmed in deep water.</P>
<P>In this pa&s;&s;age we were accompanied by va&s;t &s;hoals of fi&s;h, and were continually incommoded by numerous flocks of the birds called boobies, making our &s;hip their re&s;ting place, which fouled our yards and deck with their dung as fa&s;t as we could clean them. However, for change of diet, &s;ome of my people made ra|gouts of them, and the &s;moakers made &s;tems for their pipes of their long wing-bones.</P>
<P>We fell in with Cape Corientes in the begin|ning of the month of Augu&s;t, and were carried away to the i&s;lands called the Tres Marias, by a hard gale at &s;outh, and came to an anchor under the lee of the middlemo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands, but could &s;ee no &s;ign of the Succe&s;s having been there. After a tedious &s;earch on all the three
<PB N="225" REF="233">
i&s;lands for fre&s;h water, there was nothing like a &s;tream of it that we could find. This was the more a&s;toni&s;hing to us, as one or two of our late navigators have reported that fre&s;h water is to be found there in &s;ufficient plenty. It may have been &s;o when they were there; but we were unfortunate enough to &s;eek, when none was to be found.</P>
<P>After employing three days in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch, I &s;tretched over for the coa&s;t of Cali|fornia, and arrived there on the 11th of Augu&s;t. The inhabitants, as &s;oon as they di&s;covered us, made fires all along the &s;hore as the &s;hip ran by them; and, towards the evening, it falling calm, two of them came off to us on a bark-log, but were a long time before they would accept of our invitation to come on board of us. At length, they ventured in; when, in a moment, &s;eeing our blacks promi&s;cuou&s;ly &s;tanding toge|ther with us white men, they, with very angry countenances, &s;eparated them from us, and would hardly &s;uffer them to look at us. They talked to us with great vehemence, but we could comprehend nothing more of their meaning, than that they rejoiced to &s;ee us. Night coming on, they took their leave, and we gave them a knife or two, an old coat, and &s;ome other trifles, which &s;eemed to plea&s;e them very well. They expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves by &s;igns in &s;uch a manner, that we could gue&s;s they gave us repeated invi|tations to go on &s;hore with them.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="234">On Sunday the 13th of Augu&s;t, at day-break, we found our&s;elves near Puerto Seguro, which may be readily known by three white rocks, not much unlike the Needles of the I&s;le of Wight, and you mu&s;t keep clo&s;e on board the outermo&s;t to fetch into the bay. We entered Puerto Seguro, &s;urrounded by numbers of &s;mall embarkations of the inhabitants, while the &s;hore, on all &s;ides, was crouded with Indians, who&s;e numbers vi&s;ibly increa&s;ed by multitudes which flocked together from the adjacent parts. Our anchor was no &s;ooner down, than they came off to us in &s;hoals, &s;ome few on their bark-logs, but mo&s;t of them &s;wimming, talking and call|ing out to one another in a noi&s;y and confu&s;ed manner, but &s;uch as plainly &s;hewed how de&s;irous they were to come to us. Our &s;hip was in an in&s;tant full of the&s;e &s;warthy gentlemen quite naked, and among&s;t the re&s;t was their King, or Chief man, who, unexpectedly, delivered to me his batoon, or en&s;ign of royalty, which I imme|diately returned to him. This man, notwith|&s;tanding the wildne&s;s of his appearance to us, had a good countenance, and his behaviour had &s;omething that was very engaging in it. I was, at fir&s;t, at a lo&s;s to know how to entertain our numerous gue&s;ts, but at length I thought of re|galing them with &s;ome of our liquid &s;weetmeats, which we had in great plenty. This they liked extremely, and the &s;poons, which were mo&s;tly &s;ilver, they returned with great hone&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="235">Having thus commenced a friend&s;hip with them, at day-break next morning our boat went on &s;hore to cut wood and fill water; and before the &s;un was up, we were again crouded with our former gue&s;ts, who &s;eemed as if they could never be weary of gazing at us. To keep up the amity we had already contracted with them, I ordered a great boiler to be carried on &s;hore, with good &s;tore of flour and &s;ugar, and a negroe cook, who was continually boiling of ha&s;ty pudding for the numbers of &s;pectators on the beach; and it really behoved us to en|deavour to keep in their favour, for on &s;eeing a few of our men rolling great and cumber&s;ome ca&s;ks of water over the heavy &s;and, it inclined them to help us. To this may be added, a &s;en&s;e of the kind treatment they met with from us, and the particular readine&s;s of their chief to &s;erve us, by &s;hewing his people a good example; for, after Mr. Randall, my Lieutenant, he him|&s;elf took up the &s;econd log of wood to carry to the boat, and was immediately followed by two or three hundred of them, who, encouraged by his example, all took to the work, repaying our civilities with their &s;ervices, and every day they &s;eemed more and more fond of us.</P>
<P>Mean while, the rumour of our arrival was &s;pread through all the neighbouring parts, and &s;ome of the clans, different from tho&s;e who in|habited the &s;hores, came daily to take a view of us. Tho&s;e who came from any di&s;tance in the country could not &s;wim; and that they were dif|ferent
<PB N="228" REF="236">
from tho&s;e we had fir&s;t &s;een on our arrival here, appeared by their manner of painting them&s;elves, and by other little di&s;tinctions which were vi&s;ible among&s;t them; but they all united to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, nor were any of them idle but the women, who u&s;ed to &s;it in companies on the &s;corching &s;and, waiting for their &s;hare of what was going forward, which they u&s;ed to re|ceive very thankfully and without quarrelling.</P>
<P>Having done all our bu&s;ine&s;s here, in the &s;pace of five days, on the 18th of Augu&s;t, in the morning, we prepared for our departure in the afternoon. We employed the morning in making a large di&s;tribution of &s;ugar among&s;t the women. To the men we gave a great many knives, old axes, and old iron, which we had taken in our prizes. The&s;e were the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful things to them, and of which they &s;tood mo&s;t in need; in return for which, &s;ome of them gave us bows and arrows, deer-&s;kin bags, live foxes, &s;quirrels, and the like. Great many of the men &s;taid in the &s;hip all the while we were purcha&s;ing our anchor, and it was not till we were under weigh that they all jumped over|board to join in the lamentations of their coun|trymen on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The men in this &s;outhern part of California, are tall, &s;traight, and well made; their limbs are large, their hair coar&s;e and black, and bare|ly reaches down to their &s;houlders. Their women are of a much &s;maller &s;ize; their hair is much longer than the mens, and with it &s;ome of their

faces are almo&s;t covered. The men go quite naked, and have not the lea&s;t thing to cover any part of them, except their heads, round which they wear a band of red and white &s;ilk-gra&s;s, adorned on each &s;ide with a tuft of hawk's fea|thers. The women, on the contrary, wear a thick fringe of &s;ilk-gra&s;s, which hangs down to their knees, and have either a deer's &s;kin, or the &s;kin of a large bird, carele&s;ly wrapped over their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more wild and &s;avage to look at, than the&s;e people at fir&s;t &s;ight: but there is a wide difference between what they &s;eem, and what they really are; for, by all we could di&s;|cern in their behaviour towards one another, and in their deportment towards us, they are endued with great good nature.</P>
<P>They &s;eem to lead a carele&s;s life, and to en|joy every thing in common among&s;t them; and, having nothing but their daily food to provide, they are &s;trangers to tho&s;e numerous grati|fications, the want of which multiply di&s;tre&s;&s;es among nations more civilized and more refined. Their contentment makes them hone&s;t, for they never offered to &s;teal even the things mo&s;t u&s;e|ful to them. In a word, they &s;eem to pa&s;s their lives, according to the notions we have of the pure&s;t &s;implicity of the earlie&s;t ages of the world, before di&s;cord and contention were heard of a|mong&s;t men. Having no enemies, they live in perfect peace and harmony with one another. Hunting and fi&s;hing are their only employ|ments,
<PB N="230" REF="239">
except making the in&s;truments they u&s;e in the&s;e pur&s;uits, which are the &s;imple&s;t that can be. They have no canoes, and go to &s;ea on bark-logs; but they are the mo&s;t expert divers I ever beheld By their &s;imple manner of living, and their continual exerci&s;e, they live to a great age; and yet, what is very &s;urprizing, they do not ap|pear to be very numerous, con&s;idering the extent of their country. Their only enemies are the wild bea&s;ts, and of the&s;e there are plenty in the woods and fore&s;ts. They do not appear to be &s;o jea|lous of their women as they have been repre&s;ent|ed; for we had the company of &s;ome hundreds of them, young and old, without any re&s;traint from the men. Two things were remarkable, that they never would &s;uffer us to take &s;nuff, but would earne&s;tly take it from us whenever we attempted it; nor would they ever &s;uffer us to look through a &s;pying-gla&s;s, which I had frequent re&s;ort to, to &s;ee how our work of wood|ing and watering went on. In the&s;e two in|&s;tances, they always took upon them to con|troul us, and in the&s;e two only; the cau&s;es of which we could never learn.</P>
<P>They go out to &s;ea on their bark-logs, which are only compo&s;ed of five logs of a light wood, made fa&s;t to each other by wooden pegs, rowing with a double paddle; and with their harpoons, which are made of a &s;ort of hard wood, they &s;trike the large&s;t albicores, and bring them in when &s;truck. This was altogether &s;urprizing to us, who had &s;o often experienced the &s;trength

of that fi&s;h, and the difficulty of getting them into our &s;hip, when either hooked or &s;truck. One would imagine, that as &s;oon as the&s;e Indi|ans had &s;truck one of the&s;e albicores, on his light embarkation, it would run away with him and his bark-log; but they either &s;trike them &s;o as to give them &s;ome mortal wound, or have &s;ome particular way of managing them, for they &s;truggle and re&s;i&s;t in vain. When we were in this port, it was apparently their fi&s;hing &s;ea|&s;on; but by the number of deer-&s;kins one &s;ees among&s;t them, it is natural to conclude they have al&s;o their &s;ea&s;on for hunting. The &s;kins of their deer are grey, and &s;o are the &s;kins of their foxes and &s;quirrels; of all which, it is like|ly, they eat indifferently, as of mo&s;t other ani|mals that become their prey.

<P>What the&s;e Indians u&s;ed in&s;tead of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ead is very remarkable. It is a &s;mall black &s;eed of an oily &s;ub&s;tance, which they grind much the &s;ame way as we do our chocolate, and afterwards make it up in &s;ome &s;uch manner. The look of the&s;e black lumps or rolls &s;o made up, is not very inviting, yet the ta&s;te is not very di&s;agreeable. When they want to drink, they go to the river.</P>
<P>Their arms are bows and arrows. Their bows are about &s;ix feet in length, and their arrows &s;eem to be &s;omewhat too long for their bows. Their bow-&s;trings are made of deer's &s;inews, and their arrows are compo&s;ed of a hollow cane for

two-thirds of their length, and the other third next the point is of a heavy kind of wood, which is headed with a piece of flint, and &s;ome|times with a kind of agate, the edges of which are indented, or cut in teeth like a &s;aw. They made no manner of &s;hew of their arms to us, and it was rarely that we &s;aw them in the hands of any of the men. The women had them in the woods in &s;earch of game, which may be thence pre&s;umed to be &s;ome part of their em|ployment. Upon the whole, they may be truly &s;aid to be a happy people.</P>
<P>Aug. 18, I &s;ailed, as before-mentioned, from Puerto Suguro, and the &s;ame evening we took our departure from Cape St. Lucar, in latitude 23 deg. 50 min. N. bound to Canton, in China, the mo&s;t likely place where we could hope to meet with Engli&s;h &s;hips homeward bound for Europe.</P>
<P>Aug. 21, we di&s;covered an i&s;land bearing W. S. W. 110 leagues di&s;tant from Cape St. Lucar. I endeavoured to get in with it; but night coming on, I could not lo&s;e time to view it. This i&s;le my people called after my name. From hence we &s;teered gradually into the paral|lel of 13 deg. N. but had our way &s;topped for two or three days by we&s;terly winds. We were a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch an unfore&s;een delay, and be|gan to dread we might meet with many &s;uch rever&s;es of winds in this pa&s;&s;age; nor could we conjecture, or conceive what might be the cau&s;e or cau&s;es of them. In the mid&s;t of this, the
<PB N="233" REF="243">
u&s;ual trade-wind prevailed again, and delivered us from the fears and apprehen&s;ions we had been involved in upon this occa&s;ion. With this we proceeded on our pa&s;&s;age, keeping the pa|rallel or track of the thirteenth degree of north|ern latitude, except when we judged our&s;elves to be near the &s;hoals of St. Bartholomew. We then ventured to &s;ail a degree more northerly, and &s;o continued to do for a run of 60 or 70 leagues.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after we had left California, my people, who had hitherto enjoyed an unin|terrupted &s;tate of health, began to be afflicted with a &s;ickne&s;s which particularly affected their &s;tomachs. This we took to be owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to the quantities of &s;weetmeats they were continually devouring, together with the dried beef, half devoured with ants, cock|roaches, and other vermin, which was their daily food. This &s;ickne&s;s increa&s;ed every day, in&s;o|much that, out of our &s;mall number, we once buried two in one day, one of whom was John Popple&s;tone, our ingenious armourer, who was of &s;uch u&s;e to us on the i&s;land of Juan Fernan|dez. Before we had &s;tretched with favourable gales the length of Guam, mo&s;t of my people were &s;ick and di&s;abled, my &s;hip began to be very leaky, and, to add &s;till to our misfortunes, we had the ill luck to have one of our pumps &s;plit, and rendered u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, we met with black and di&s;mal weather, with tempe&s;tuous winds,
<PB N="234" REF="244">
flying and varying all round the compa&s;s. The&s;e boi&s;terous gales rai&s;ed &s;uch a tumbling &s;ea, and our &s;hip laboured &s;o much in it, that the knee of her head, and the whole beak-head, became loo&s;e; &s;o that the bow&s;prit fetched way, and played with the motion of the &s;hip, which it continued to do all the time we were out at &s;ea, and till we arrived at Canton. Our main-ma&s;t &s;tood for &s;ome time without &s;hrouds on the lar|board &s;ide, till we could unlay our be&s;t cable to make more, having knotted and &s;pliced the old &s;hrouds till our labour was in vain.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, I my&s;elf was taken violently ill, and had no hope to recover till a fit of the gout gave me &s;ome re|lief. Great was our want of every thing fit or comfortable for per&s;ons in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ick|ne&s;s; yet, about the beginning of October, we pa&s;&s;ed by Guam; and, though upon the very brink of peri&s;hing, we dared not venture in, for fear the inhabitants &s;hould take the advantage of our weakne&s;s, and make &s;ome attempt upon our lives.</P>
<P>From Guam I directed my cour&s;e for the i&s;land of Formo&s;a. And now, though the length of our voyage was decrea&s;ing very fa&s;t, our &s;ick|ne&s;s was daily increa&s;ing upon us in a much greater proportion; and mo&s;t truly it may be &s;aid, that both our &s;hip and our&s;elves were no longer fit for the &s;ea. It was the 3d of No|vember before we had &s;ight of that i&s;land, and the 10th, before we could get any &s;ort of direc|tions
<PB N="235" REF="245">
to enable us to reach our intended port. At length, as we were pa&s;&s;ing through a very narrow channel, between a couple of i&s;lands, a fi&s;herman took notice, by our cautious manner of working, that we were &s;trangers, and made &s;igns to us to bring our &s;hip to, till he came up with us; when we made him under&s;tand in general, that we were bound to Macao, and he made &s;igns that he would conduct us thither, if we would give him as many pieces of &s;ilver as he counted little fi&s;h out of his ba&s;ket, which amounted to 40. We accordingly counted out 40 dollars into a hat, and next day he took us in charge, and anchored us &s;afe in the road of Macao, near the entrance of the river of Canton.</P>
<P>Soon after our arrival, there came off to us a great many of the Succe&s;s's people, to make us a vi&s;it; I was amazed at the &s;ight of them, and was very glad to hear their &s;tory. They &s;aid, their Commander, Clipperton, left me de&s;igned|ly; that they went directly to Guam, where they were very well refre&s;hed, and &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions; that their Captain &s;old the Governor a great quantity of powder and &s;hot, and &s;everal other valuable things, and permitted the Mar|quis of Villa Rocha, who was his pri&s;oner, to go on &s;hore there; that Mr. Godfrey the agent, and a marine officer, went to &s;ettle the accounts for what &s;upplies of things they had had; and that, as &s;oon as they were landed, and the boat come off again, Captain Clipperton weighed with his &s;hip, in order to attack a &s;hip of 20 guns from
<PB N="236" REF="246">
Manilla, that had lain quietly in the road in company with him all the time: that in ap|proaching her he ran his own &s;hip upon the rocks, and &s;oon found the enemy was prepared for him: that, his condition being de&s;perate, and &s;uppo&s;ing the lo&s;s of his &s;hip inevitable, he had recour&s;e to his ca&s;e of brandy, and took &s;o abundantly of it, that he fell on the deck, and &s;nored out his time in a bea&s;tly manner, whil&s;t his Fir&s;t Lieutenant, David&s;on, in his &s;tead, un|dertook the command of the &s;hip, which he bravely executed till he was killed: he was &s;ucceeded by Captain Cook, their Second Lieu|tenant, who made a hand&s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, and got the &s;hip afloat again, after &s;he had lain on the rocks forty-eight hours: that they lo&s;t their pri&s;oner the Marquis de la Rocha, and al&s;o Mr. Godfrey, the agent-general, with the officer already mentioned; which gave the &s;hip's company &s;o much di&s;ta&s;te, that they would not &s;uffer him to have the command of them any more, and, locking him up in his cabbin, cho&s;e Captain Cook to take charge of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>They had, it &s;eems, much bad weather be|tween Guam and Amoy in China, whither they got with much difficulty; and there made a dividend of all they had taken, half to the owners, and half to the &s;hip's company. Clip|perton de&s;igned for the &s;traits of Malacca; but his people, fearing he had no good intentions, would go no farther with him than Macao, that being a Chri&s;tian port. Upon their arrival
<PB N="237" REF="247">
there, the Governor ordered Clipperton into cu&s;tody. It &s;eems he had broke pri&s;on for|merly from thence, where he had been confined (as far as could be learned) on account of his having run away with Dampier's com|mi&s;&s;ion and one of his prizes; but upon pro|ducing his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion now for the Succe&s;s, they gave him no farther trouble, and only contented them&s;elves with fleecing him a little. Here he &s;old his &s;hip, the Succe&s;s, for about 1000l. &s;terling.&mdash;[Such is the account given by Captain Shelvock, for the informa|tion, as he &s;ays, of the gentlemen-owners, who will never, either publickly or privately, be let into the truth of that &s;tory.]</P>
<P>But to go on, Nov. 12, about noon, a pilot came off to us, and we immediately weighed, and entered the river of Canton, where, finding the Bonita and Ha&s;tings, two Engli&s;h country|&s;hips, I anchored, and &s;ent off an officer, to de&s;ire them to in&s;truct us how to behave our|&s;elves in this port, and to acquaint me with the cu&s;toms of it. To this they an&s;wered, that, &s;ince the Cadogan and Frances, two European Engli&s;h &s;hips were lying at Wampo, they would advi&s;e me to &s;end up to their factories at Canton, to acquaint them of our arrival, and with the rea&s;ons which obliged me to come into that river, which I accordingly did the next day. I now thought I was going to re&s;t a little from my labours; but, to my misfortune, I &s;uffered as much here, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, as
<PB N="238" REF="248">
I had in any former part of my voyage; for the evening we anchored at Wampo, where the Engli&s;h &s;hips commonly lie, there happened an accident which gave occa&s;ion to much trouble. One of my men, being in a hurry to remove his effects on board the Bonita, in order to go in her to Fort St. George, the Bonita's boat was, in her way to their &s;hip, pur&s;ued by a Hoppo, or cu&s;tom-hou&s;e boat, who wanted to &s;earch her. The fellow, being in liquor, and fearing they would take away the &s;ilver he had with him, fired a mu&s;quet at the pur&s;uers, and killed the officer. Early the next morning, the corp&s;e was laid at the door of one of the Engli&s;h hou&s;es or factories, where Chine&s;e officers, appointed for that purpo&s;e, waited for the fir&s;t con&s;iderable Engli&s;hman that &s;hould come out, without any regard to whom this act of violence and murder was to be imputed. It happened that the Super|cargo belonging to the Bonita, was the fir&s;t that came out; on him they &s;eized, put him in chains, and led him, by way of example, about the &s;ub|urbs of Canton. All that could be &s;aid or done by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Chine&s;e mer|chants who were in commerce with the Eng|li&s;h, availed nothing; till my man, who com|mitted the fact, was delivered to them, and then the Bonita's Supercargo was &s;oon after re|lea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is the cu&s;tom in China, at lea&s;t at Canton, to exact a certain &s;um of money from all &s;hips that come there, according to their mea&s;ure|ment, which is divided into rates or portions of
<PB N="239" REF="249">
fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third. I therefore every day expected the Hoppo to come to mea&s;ure my &s;hip, but was given to under&s;tand, that I mu&s;t go up to Canton before that could be done, though even at the hazard of my life. I ac|cordingly went, and &s;taid two days at the Ca|dogan's factory, during which time I was hour|ly alarmed by &s;uch &s;tories as made me fear that I &s;hould, indi&s;po&s;ed as I was, be dragged away from my bed, and put in irons: but at the end of two days, I was obliged to go down again to the &s;hip, to be pre&s;ent at the mea&s;ure|ment; and a day afterwards the Hoppo came with a numerous retinue, and &s;eemed to do his bu&s;ine&s;s very quietly, but would not let me know what was the &s;um he intended to exact. This gave me much trouble, for I began to think the Chine&s;e, through a fal&s;e report of our great riches, had an intention to gratify their love of money by a heavy impo&s;ition; and in this I was not mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>I had not been here many days before I was de&s;erted by all my officers and &s;hip's company, who were continually employed in removing their effects from on board my &s;hip to &s;ome of the Europeans, without my knowledge, as I was all the time confined to my bed. My officers were engaging the Indian gentlemen in their in|tere&s;t, and had left me and my &s;on, with a few negroes, to look after the &s;hip. In &s;hort, my &s;hip's company had &s;o many ways of di&s;po&s;ing of their effects, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to oblige
<PB N="240" REF="250">
them to do what I &s;hould have thought ju&s;tice to the gentlemen in England and to my&s;elf. In a word, they were all &s;oon recovered of their il|ne&s;s by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they met with here, and were become their own ma&s;ters. The gentle|men who pre&s;ided over the trade, &s;o little con|&s;idered our ca&s;e, that they had half a mind to refu&s;e me a pa&s;&s;age in one of their &s;hips; and, in effect, I was treated by them almo&s;t as one enemy might treat another in a neutral port.</P>
<P>The Captains Hill and New&s;ham, when they fir&s;t came to &s;ee me, were a&s;toni&s;hed at the ruin|ous appearance of my &s;hip; and when I had given them a &s;hort hi&s;tory of my voyage, and de&s;ired they would receive me with my effects, they an&s;wered, that, &s;ince they plainly &s;aw my &s;hip was in no condition to &s;tir any farther, upon paying our pa&s;&s;age, they would entertain us as &s;oon as we plea&s;ed. This I depended upon, and expected to have no farther trouble than to re|move our&s;elves at any time; but, on the contrary, I found that I had ignorantly applied to the wrong per&s;ons, and that my addre&s;s &s;hould have been to the Supercargoes, by which means I was left neglected, while the Engli&s;h Captains were ordered to fall down with their &s;hips five or &s;ix miles below us. Thus was I left de&s;titute in the company of five foreign &s;hips, who, perceiving my own countrymen to be &s;o carele&s;s of me, were &s;o kind as to offer me their &s;ervice, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ted me with what they could; and, had it not been for them, I don't know what I might have
<PB N="241" REF="251">
&s;uffered, for I was under perpetual alarms that the Chine&s;e had a de&s;ign to chop my &s;hip, that is, to &s;eize her.</P>
<P>Having found out my error in applying to the Captains, and not to the Supercargoes, I &s;ent up a letter to them, not to de&s;ire, but to de|mand a pa&s;&s;age for me, my officers, and &s;hip's company, which I was &s;en&s;ible they could not refu&s;e, and indeed they did not; but their con|de&s;cen&s;ion was accompanied with a charge to the Engli&s;h Captains, not to receive any thing belonging to us, except it was con&s;igned to the India Company in England. This was an ar|ticle which my people utterly rejected, vowing they would as &s;oon throw what they had into the &s;ea, as comply with &s;uch a demand; for my part, it gave me no concern, being con&s;cious to my&s;elf that I had infringed none of their privi|leges. At the &s;ame time that I was acquainted with this intention of receiving us as pa&s;&s;engers, I was al&s;o informed of the Hoppo's demand for anchorage in the river, which was no le&s;s than 6000 tahel; and, to quicken me in the payment of this exorbitant &s;um, there was a penalty an|nexed to this extortion of 500 additional tahel for every day we failed in the payment of it. In &s;hort, there was no means by which I could evade this uncon&s;cionable impo&s;ition; and as it was a day before I could po&s;&s;ibly &s;end the 6000 tahel up to Canton, they required 500 tahel more for neglect of payment; &s;o that they received from me, upon this extraordinary occa&s;ion, the
<PB N="242" REF="252">
full &s;um of 6500 tahel, equal to 2166l. 13s. 4d. Engli&s;h money. This was, as is apprehended, about &s;ix times as much as the Cadogan paid, which was the large&s;t Engli&s;h &s;hip there, and mea&s;ured a third more than mine. It was now high time to get out of my &s;hip; but before I quitted her, I &s;old her for 2000 tahel, which money, and the re&s;t of my effects, were con|&s;igned to the India Company.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of December, 1722, I &s;ailed in the Cadogan, commanded by Captain John Hill, in company with the Frances, Cap|tain New&s;ham, who, &s;ailing better than we, left us as &s;oon as we were out at &s;ea. Captain Hill, finding his &s;hip very tender, put into Batavia, where we continued about 10 days, and were informed there were &s;everal pirates in tho&s;e &s;eas; we, therefore, when we departed from Batavia, joined the Dutch homeward-bound fleet in Ban|tam-bay. The Dutch Commodore promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in wooding and watering at Mew-i&s;land, the water at Batavia being very bad; but on our joining Capt. New&s;ham in the &s;traits of Sunda, the Dutch made that a pretence to leave us be|fore we got the length of Mew-i&s;land; and Capt. New&s;ham al&s;o de&s;erted us the &s;ame evening, &s;o that we were left to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>We continued at Mew-i&s;land &s;ix or &s;even days, during which time &s;everal boats came to us from Princes i&s;land, and brought us turtle, cocoa|nuts, pine-apples, and other fruits.</P>
<P>Some of the people having &s;een wild cattle
<PB N="243" REF="253">
grazing near the &s;trand, went on &s;hore with de|&s;ign to kill them; but before they had advanc|ed near enough, they di&s;covered a &s;mall tyger, and &s;aw the track of an old one, upon which they retired to the boat. At this place &s;ome of the gentlemen belonging to this &s;hip, in their outward-bound pa&s;&s;age, &s;aw a rhinoceros.</P>
<P>From Mew-i&s;land we had a very plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age to and about the Cape of Good Hope, which, in my opinion, was greatly owing to Cap|tain Hill's good conduct, in coming in with the land betimes, I mean upon the ea&s;ternmo&s;t part of the bank, and keeping a moderate di&s;tance from the land. I cannot be po&s;itive, but I think we never exceeded a degree in di&s;tance from it, generally le&s;s, and &s;ometimes even made the land it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this cour&s;e, I do not remember that we took in our top-&s;ails above twice; once for a &s;quall, which was over in an hour's time: and, another time, being threatened by the appearance of bad weather, Capt. Hill made all the requi&s;ite pre|parations to receive it, which done, he &s;tood in for the land; and, in a few hours, we had fair weather, a favourable gale, and all our &s;mall &s;ails &s;et, at the &s;ame time that there remained great appearance of foul weather to the &s;outhward of us, which continued for &s;everal days afterwards.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved before, that the Frances and the Dutch &s;hips had &s;even days the advantage of us, by leaving us in the &s;traits of Sunda, not|with&s;tanding which, we gained the Cape about
<PB N="244" REF="254">
as many days before the Frances, although &s;he &s;ailed &s;o much better than we: and, as to the Dutch &s;hips, there was no appearance at all of their arrival when we left the Cape.</P>
<P>The officers of our &s;hip, by comparing their accounts with tho&s;e of &s;ome of the Gentlemen belonging to the Frances, found that &s;he had &s;uffered a great deal of bad weather; whil&s;t we, who were 10 leagues, or thereabout, to the northward of them, or nearer the &s;hore, enjoyed fine plea&s;ant weather and fair wind continually, till we arrived in the Table-bay, which we did the latter end of March. This I &s;hould think of &s;ufficient weight for any other to pur&s;ue the &s;ame track. Here we found Governor Boon, in the London Ea&s;t Indiaman, and others, bound for England.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we lay at the Cape of Good Hope, nothing remarkable occurred, and it has been &s;o often de&s;cribed, that I can &s;ay nothing of it that has not been &s;aid by mo&s;t who have been there before.</P>
<P>From the Cape of Good Hope we had an agreeable pa&s;&s;age to the i&s;land of St. Helena, and from thence to England.</P>
<P>We made the Land's-end in the latter end of July; and, being come into the Briti&s;h channel, met with bri&s;k gales from the we&s;tern quarter, with thick foggy weather.</P>
<P>On July the 30th, in the evening, we an|chored under Dungene&s;s, and the &s;ame night &s;ome of the Supercargoes and pa&s;&s;engers, and
<PB N="245" REF="255">
among&s;t the re&s;t my&s;elf, hired a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to carry us to Dover, where we arrived early the next morning, and the &s;ame day proceeded to|wards London, where we arrived on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus ended a long and unfortunate voyage of three years, &s;even months, and &s;ome days; after having &s;ailed very con&s;iderably more than round the circumference of the earth, and hav|ing gone through a great variety of dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, both on &s;ea and &s;hore.</P>

<HEAD>COMMODORE ANSON's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN, in the year 1739, the Spani&s;h depredations had rou&s;ed the national re&s;entment, and the pacific mini&s;try who then were entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of affairs, found it impo&s;&s;ible any longer to prevent a war with Spain, &s;everal projects were propo&s;ed, and &s;everal plans formed, for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the enemy in the mo&s;t effectual manner, by cutting off the re&s;ources by which alone they were encouraged to continue their in&s;ults, and by which alone they could be enabled to &s;upport a war.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, two expeditions were planned by Sir Charles Wager, then at the head of the admiralty, and two gentlemen named by him for carrying them into execution; which were no &s;ooner laid before the privy council to be examined than they were unanimou&s;ly approved.</P>
<P>Captain An&s;on, who was nominated to com|mand the one, being out upon a crui&s;e, a ve&s;&s;el was di&s;patched to order him to return with his &s;hip, the Centurion, to Port&s;mouth; and Mr. Cornwall, who was appointed to command the other, was acquainted with the honour con|ferred upon him, and directed to prepare ac|cordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="257">There are not to be found in the annals of Britain two expeditions, remote in the de&s;tina|tion, yet having a connection one with the other, that promi&s;ed equal advantages with the&s;e to the nation, equal honour to the promoters, or equal wealth and glory to the commanders: but by what fatality the&s;e expeditions were changed, or by what &s;tate-craft one came to be laid a&s;ide, and the other delayed,&mdash;who were the traitors that betrayed the &s;ecret of their de&s;tina|tion, or who the demon of &s;eduction was that perverted the grand de&s;ign to the pitiful purpo&s;e of one &s;ingle pilfering project,&mdash;remains at pre|&s;ent among tho&s;e &s;ecrets, which, perhaps, a &s;e|cond Dalrymple, in &s;ome remote period of time, may di&s;cover; when it will probably appear how much the influence of Chilian gold had operated in defeating the mo&s;t formidable project for the humiliation of Spain that ever was devi&s;ed; and how ea&s;y it is for a prime mini&s;ter of Eng|land, in the plenitude of power, to defeat the be&s;t concerted mea&s;ures, backed and &s;upported by the King in his council, when either pride, envy, avarice, or emulation, may prompt him to oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The project, as fir&s;t intended, was to con&s;i&s;t of two &s;trong &s;quadrons; one under Captain An&s;on was to take on board three independent companies of 100 men each, and Bland's regi|ment of foot (who was him&s;elf to command the land forces), and was to &s;ail with all po&s;|&s;ible expedition by the Cape of Good Hope to

the city of Manilla, in the i&s;land of Luconia, of which city and i&s;land frequent mention has al|ready been made in the cour&s;e of this work; while that commanded by Captain Cornwall, of equal force, was to proceed round Cape Horn into the South Seas, there to range the coa&s;ts of Chili, Peru, and Mexico; and when the Com|mander in Chief had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the royal trea&s;ures in that quarter, he was then to direct his cour&s;e to the Philippines, and join the &s;quadron of Captain An&s;on.

The reader will perceive, at fir&s;t view, the va&s;t importance of this noble undertaking, calculated at once to enrich the nation, and to determine the war without the effu&s;ion of much blood; for the places intended to be attacked were at that time incapable of re&s;i&s;tance; and as they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the royal trea&s;ures, any failure in the return of which mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity oblige Spain to &s;ue for peace, that haughty nation mu&s;t thus have been &s;ubdued without a battle. But po&s;terity will &s;tand amazed when they are told the i&s;&s;ue of this project, on which Sir Charles Wager was &s;o intent, that, tho' it was the 10th of September before Captain An&s;on arrived in town, yet by the 18th he had received orders to take under his command the Argyle, Severn, Pearl, Wager, and Trial &s;loop, and to proceed to victual the &s;ame with the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="249" REF="259">
mo&s;t expedition. Before the end of December &s;uch di&s;patch had been made by that vigilant officer, that the &s;hips were in readine&s;s to take the troops on board; but in January, when Captain An&s;on attended the Board to receive further orders, he was told by Sir Charles, that the Manilla expedition was laid a&s;ide, for what rea&s;ons he knew not, but that the expedition to the South Seas was &s;till intended; and that he and his &s;quadron, as their fir&s;t de&s;tination was now countermanded, &s;hould be employed in that &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Accordingly on the 10th of January, 1740, he received his commi&s;&s;ion as Commodore; yet it was not till the 10th of June that he obtained from the Duke of Newca&s;tle his Maje&s;ty's in|&s;tructions; and even then &s;o many ob&s;tacles were thrown in the way, &s;o many difficulties &s;tarted, and &s;o many delays contrived, that, be|fore he was permitted to &s;ail, which was not till the latter end of September, the Spaniards were &s;o well informed of his de&s;igns, that a per&s;on who had been employed in the South-Sea Company's &s;ervice, arrived from Panama, and was able to relate to the Commodore mo&s;t of the particulars of his &s;trength and de&s;tina|tion, from what he had learnt among the mer|chants before he left the South-Seas: but a &s;till more extraordinary proof of their early and perfect intelligence was di&s;covered afterwards, in the cour&s;e of the voyage, when the Pearl, being &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the &s;quadron,
<PB N="250" REF="260">
in a &s;torm, on the coa&s;t of Brazil, fell in with the Spani&s;h fleet, that, during the unprecedented de|lay, had been purpo&s;ely fitted out to ruin the ex|pedition, and found Admiral Pi&s;arro &s;o well in|&s;tructed in the form and make of Com. An&s;on's broad pendant, and tho&s;e he employed had imi|tated it &s;o exactly, that Capt. Mitchell, who com|manded the Pearl, was decoyed by it within gun|&s;hot, before he was able to di&s;cover his mi&s;take.</P>
<P>All delays being at length overcome, the &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of five men of war, a &s;loop of war, and two victualling &s;hips, namely, the Centurion, of 60 guns, 400 men, commanded by Captain An&s;on, as Commodore; the Glou|ce&s;ter, of 50 guns, 300 men, of which Richard Norris, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was commander; the Severn, of 50 guns, 300 men, the Hon. Edward Legg, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Commander; the Pearl, of 40 guns, 250 men, Matthew Mitchell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Commander; the Wager, of 28 guns, 160 men, the Hon. John Murray, Commander; two victuallers, the In|du&s;try and Ann pinks, the large&s;t of about 400, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ther about 200 tons burthen; were or|dered to take the troops on board at St. Helen's. But how much the numbers, &s;trength, and pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s, of this &s;quadron, were dimi|ni&s;hed by the various incidents that took place in near a twelvemonth's procra&s;tination, may fully be conceived by what has already been &s;aid. Had the honourable Board from whence the fir&s;t idea of the expedition originated been permitted to direct, all the old and ordinary
<PB N="251" REF="261">
&s;eamen on board the &s;hips would have been ex|changed for &s;uch as were young and able; the full complement of each &s;hip would have been made up; and the &s;alt provi&s;ions which had been &s;o long on board in the Channel would have been remanded on &s;hore, and fre&s;h provi|&s;ions replaced in their room: but, in&s;tead of the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary precautions, the Captains were glad to retain their old crews; the deficiency in the numbers of which, amounting to more than 300 men, was no otherwi&s;e made up than by &s;ending on board about 100 cripples from the ho&s;pitals, and a party of raw marines who had never been at &s;ea before: nor were they more fortunate in the change that was made in the land forces; for, in&s;tead of three indepen|dent companies, of 100 men each, and Bland's regiment of foot, as fir&s;t promi&s;ed, they had only 400 invalids from Chel&s;ea allotted them, one part of whom was incapable of action by their age and infirmities, and the other part u&s;e|le&s;s by their ignorance of their duty. But this diminution of &s;trength was not the greate&s;t mi&s;|fortune that attended the&s;e mea&s;ures; the im|portance of the time which was wilfully wa&s;ted was in its con&s;equences the &s;ource of all tho&s;e calamities to which the enterprize was after|wards expo&s;ed, by obliging the Commodore to make his pa&s;&s;age round the Cape in the mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on, when, as it was fore&s;een, almo&s;t all the invalids, to a man, peri&s;hed long before they arrived at the place of action, ex|piring

in a mo&s;t lamentable condition when they came to be attacked with the &s;curvy, with their wounds bleeding afre&s;h, which had been healed &s;ome of them 20, &s;ome 30, and &s;ome 40 years before.</P>
<P>But to proceed: Of this voyage there are two very authentic and well-written accounts; one by Pa&s;co Thomas, the mathematical ma&s;ter on board the Centurion, who &s;ailed in her out of the Briti&s;h Channel, and returned with her in &s;afety when &s;he arrived at Port&s;mouth, and was an eye-witne&s;s and careful ob&s;erver of all that pa&s;&s;ed: the other by the Rev. Mr. Richard Walters, Chaplain to the above &s;hip, who re|ceived his materials, and every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary to authenticate his narration, from the Commander in Chief.</P>
<P>We have cho&s;en to follow the former in the narrative of facts, as mo&s;t exact and lea&s;t liable to impo&s;ition; but, in the explanatory part, we &s;hall copy the latter; becau&s;e, though Mr. Tho|mas &s;uffered nothing material that pa&s;&s;ed to e&s;cape his notice, there were many things tran|&s;acted, the motives for which he could only gue&s;s at; but the&s;e motives Mr. Walters has, by means of the Commodore's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, been able to explain.</P>

&s;ailed in company with the Lark and St. Alban's, two of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips, and &s;everal merchant|&s;hips, be&s;ides our own &s;quadron; and Saturday evening &s;aw &s;ome men-of-war, and a large fleet of merchantmen, waiting for us at Torbay. At one in the afternoon we joined them; and the Commodore hoi&s;ted his broad pendant, which was &s;aluted by all his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips in the fleet with 13 guns each. The King's &s;hips which joined us here were, the Dragon, Chatham, Winche&s;ter, and South-Sea-Ca&s;tle, and near 200 &s;ail of merchantmen under convoy, &s;ome of whom were bound to the Mediterranean, and others to &s;everal parts of North America. We had at pre&s;ent the command of the whole fleet; and this &s;ame afternoon, &s;eeing a &s;hip to the &s;outh-we&s;t, we made the Dragon a &s;ignal for cha&s;|ing her; but &s;he proved one of our own &s;hips, too far a-head of her &s;tation. At four this af|ternoon, the Start Point bore from us E. by N. at the di&s;tance of eight leagues.</P>
<P>Monday the 22d, we &s;aw two &s;ail to the we&s;t|ward, and &s;ent the Trial Sloop to &s;peak with them. They were Dutch &s;hips bound to Cura|&s;oe, with &s;oldiers for their garri&s;ons there.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day the 25th, the Winche&s;ter and South-Sea-Ca&s;tle, with the merchant-&s;hips under their convoy for Virginia, and other parts of North-America, parted from us, and proceeded on their re&s;pective voyages. And Monday the 29th, the Dragon, Chatham, St. Alban's, and Lark, with the merchant-&s;hips in their charge for the

Mediterranean, did the like; and we had now no &s;hips left in company but our own proper &s;quadron.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day the 30th, we &s;poke with a Dutch man-of-war, who came from Malta, bound for Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>Friday, October the 3d, we &s;poke with two Engli&s;h merchant-&s;hips from Li&s;bon for New-York, and the 8th we &s;poke with a French &s;loop from Rochelle. The 13th, one Philip Merrit, a common &s;ailor, died, which I mention becau&s;e he was the fir&s;t man we lo&s;t on the voyage. The next day, by an order from the Commodore, we went to &s;hort allowance; that is, one third of the allowance granted by government is kept back, in order to make our provi&s;ions hold out the longer. The 23d, we &s;poke with a &s;hip from Liverpool, and the next day with another from Gla&s;gow, for the Cape de Verde i&s;lands; as al&s;o with a &s;mall brigantine from Falmouth for Madeira, who kept us company thither. The next day we &s;poke with a Dutch &s;hip from Surinam for Holland. The 26th, at 6 o'clock in the morning, we &s;aw the land bearing W. N. W. di&s;tance &s;ix leagues, and at four in the even|ing anchored in Fonchale road, in forty fathom water, a-brea&s;t the town of Fonchale, and about a mile and a half from it. During this whole pa&s;&s;age, we had almo&s;t continually contrary wind, and boi&s;terous uncertain weather; by which means, a pa&s;&s;age which is very common|ly made in 10 or 12 days, took us up 38.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="265">Our bu&s;ine&s;s in this place was only to water, and take in wine, and &s;ome private &s;tocks: but, &s;oon after our arrival, we were informed, that they had &s;een from the i&s;land, to the we&s;tward, about 16 or 18 &s;ail of &s;hips for &s;everal days to|gether, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be a junction of French and Spani&s;h Ships of war; and as we had rea&s;on to imagine that our expedition had long been known, there was little room to doubt, but that tho&s;e &s;hips were de&s;igned to intercept and de&s;troy us before we could attempt any thing to the prejudice of Spain. On this news the Com|modore &s;ent out an Engli&s;h privateer which lay in the road, with one of his own officers, to &s;ee if they could di&s;cover them at &s;ea, and what they were; but &s;he returned the next day, having made no di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Nov. 2, Captain Norris, at his own reque&s;t, being in an ill &s;tate of health, with the con&s;ent of the Commodore quitted the command of the Glouce&s;ter, in order to return to England. The Glouce&s;ter was hereupon given to Captain Mit|chel, the Pearl to Captain Kidd, the Wager to the Hon. Captain Murray, and the Trial &s;loop to David Cheap, our Fir&s;t Lieutenant; and as one of the Lieutenants of the Glouce&s;ter had quitted with Captain Norris, our two mates, who had long depended on the Commodore, were preferred to be Lieutenants on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The 4th, at four in the afternoon, we weigh|ed and put to &s;ea, with all the &s;quadron under
<PB N="256" REF="266">
our command. An Engli&s;h &s;loop, which lay in the road, &s;aluted us at our departure with nine guns, to which we returned five.</P>
<P>The 6th, at four o'clock in the evening, we &s;aw the i&s;land of Palma, one of the Canary i&s;lands, in the latitude of 29 degrees north, and longitude from the meridian of London 19 de|grees 44 minutes we&s;t. The &s;ame day we &s;poke with a French &s;hip from Mar&s;eilles bound to Mar|tinico, and the next morning with a Dutch &s;hip from Am&s;terdam bound to Batavia, the metropo|lis of the Dutch &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>The 11th, about four in the morning, we cro&s;&s;ed the Northern Tropic for the fir&s;t time in this voyage, in long. 24 deg. 24 min. we&s;t from London.</P>
<P>The 16th, being in the latitude of about 12 deg. 20 min. and the contract with our victual|lers expiring in that latitude, the Anne Pink fired a gun, and hoi&s;ted a red flag at her fore|top ma&s;t-head, to give us notice of it.</P>
<P>On the next day all the Lieutenants of the &s;quadron were by a &s;ignal ordered on board the Centurion, and orders were given to unlade the Indu&s;try Pink, and each &s;hip to take on board from her their re&s;pective quotas of provi&s;ions; in pur&s;uance of which we immediately began to unlade her, lying by in the day, and making an ea&s;y &s;ail in the night.</P>
<P>The 19th, having unloaded and di&s;charged the Indu&s;try, at eight in the evening &s;he parted
<PB N="257" REF="267">
from us, in order to proceed to Barbadoes, whither &s;he was bound; but the Commodore having entered into a new contract with the ma&s;ter of the Anne pink, &s;he was detained with us for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, our &s;hips being too much encumbered to admit of taking on board any more provi&s;ions at this time.</P>
<P>The 28th, about five in the morning, we cro&s;&s;|ed the Equinoctial, in the longitude of 28 deg. 15 min. W. from London, the variation of the compa&s;s at that place being 35 min. E.</P>
<P>December the 2d, at eight in the morning, we &s;aw a &s;ail to the north-we&s;t, to which we gave chace. At night we lo&s;t &s;ight of her; but next morning we &s;aw her and gave chace again, but in the afternoon quitted her. We imagined this &s;ail to be a tender on the Spani&s;h fleet, &s;ent pur|po&s;ely to get intelligence of us: but on our ar|rival at the Cape of Good Hope, in our return home, we learned that &s;he was the Ea&s;t-India-Company's packet bound for the i&s;land of St. Helena.</P>
<P>The 10th, expecting to be near the coa&s;t of Brazil, we &s;ounded, and found 67 fathom water, on which we fired a gun for a &s;ignal, and alter|ed our cour&s;e more to the &s;outhward. This day died Thomas Waller, our &s;urgeon, who was &s;uc|ceeded by Henry Ettrick, &s;urgeon of the Wa|ger; the &s;urgeon of the Trial &s;ucceeded him, and Jo&s;eph Allen, our &s;urgeon's fir&s;t mate, was made &s;urgeon of the trial.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="268">The 11th, we &s;poke with a Portugue&s;e bri|gantine from Rio Janeiro, bound to Santos, one of the principal Portugue&s;e &s;ettlements in the Brazils. The 13th, we cro&s;&s;ed the South Tropic for the fir&s;t time, in long. 38 deg. 36 min. W. from London.</P>
<P>The 14th died Robert Welden, our pur&s;er, who was &s;ucceeded by John Rule, pur&s;er of the Wager, and Commodore's Secretary; Thomas Harvey, one of our mid&s;hipmen, was made pur|&s;er of the Wager, in the room of Mr. Rule.</P>
<P>The 17th, we &s;aw the land of the Brazils, from W. to W. S. W. very mountainous, and full of woods. I have, for &s;everal days la&s;t pa&s;t, found, by my ob&s;ervations, a &s;trong current on this coa&s;t, &s;etting to the &s;outhward near three quarters of a mile an hour, which, perhaps, may be occa&s;ioned by the neighbourhood of the va&s;t river of Rio de la Plata; another ob&s;ervation, which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to make after our leaving the coa&s;t of Brazil, will very much cor|roborate this conjecture.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, at four in the evening, we had 40 fathom of water, muddy ground; the i&s;land of Alvoredo, a &s;mall i&s;land at the north-ea&s;t end of the large i&s;land of St. Katharine's, then bear|ing N. W. by N. about eight leagues di&s;tant; and the next day at &s;even in the evening we came to an anchor in twelve fathom water, the north-ea&s;t end of St Catharine's bearing S. S. W. about three miles di&s;tant, and the i&s;land of Al|voredo, N. N. E. about &s;ix miles di&s;tant. Here
<PB N="259" REF="269">
we found the tide to &s;et S. S. E. and N. N. W. We &s;ent a&s;hore a Lieutenant to the fort to com|pliment the Governor, and to de&s;ire a pilot to carry us into the road. The Governor returned a very civil an&s;wer, and granted our reque&s;t. The next morning we weighed and ran up the harbour, and about noon anchored in five fa|thom and a half water, in a place they there call Boon Porto; but being &s;till too far from the watering-place, we on the 20th, about ele|ven in the morning, weighed and ran farther up between St. Katherine's and the main land of Brazil, and in the afternoon anchored and moored in five fathom water, about two miles from the watering-place; and the &s;ame even|ing our third Lieutenant went a&s;hore with ma|terials for building a tent, to &s;helter the people who were to be employed in watering. We likewi&s;e &s;aluted the Portugue&s;e fort with eleven guns, who returned us the like number.</P>
<P>Our &s;hips beginning to be very &s;ickly, tents were erected on &s;hore, one for every &s;hip, and the &s;ick were &s;ent a&s;hore to them, with &s;urgeons and proper attendance.</P>
<P>The agents for victualling, of which we had two with us, were ordered to procure what fre&s;h provi&s;ions we could expend during our &s;tay here, which they accordingly did; but though their meat, which is altogether beef, was both cheap and plenty, it was for the greate&s;t part mi&s;erably bad, and &s;carce fit to be eaten.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="270">The men throughout the whole &s;quadron be|gan now to drop off apace with fevers and fluxes, occa&s;ioned chiefly, I believe, by the vio|lent heat of the climate, and the bad air; the country being &s;o very woody that the air mu&s;t thereby be &s;tagnated, and rendered unhealthful.</P>
<P>We continued here wooding, watering, and overhauling our rigging, till Sunday, Jan. 18, 1741, during which time we had variable un|certain weather, &s;ometimes &s;ea and land breezes, at other times &s;trong gales of wind, with heavy rain, thunder and lightning, but always exce&s;|&s;ive heat.</P>
<P>While we lay here, we gave our &s;hip a tho|rough clean&s;ing, &s;moaked her between decks, in order to de&s;troy the vermin, and wa&s;hed every part with vinegar, which I mention be|cau&s;e it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in large &s;hips, the &s;tench of &s;o many &s;ick per&s;ons being noi&s;ome in hot climates.</P>
<P>Dec. 21, I ob&s;erved an eclip&s;e of the moon, and by comparing the time of the end of it, with a calculation I purpo&s;ely made of it in the me|ridian of London, from Sir I&s;aac Newton's New Theory of the Moon, I found the place where the &s;hip then lay to be 49 deg. 53 min. to the we&s;t|ward of the meridian of London. The calcula|tion it&s;elf, and the time it ended at St. Katha|rine's, I have unfortunately lo&s;t; but as the longitude is thereby &s;ettled, they are of no far|ther u&s;e, and not worth retrieving at the trouble of a new calculation.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="271">Before we arrived at this i&s;land, we had re|ceived from the de&s;criptions of M. Frezier, a French author, and &s;ome other per&s;ons who had been on the &s;pot, &s;uch accounts as, together with the climate in which it is &s;ituated, gave us very great ideas of its fruitfulne&s;s, and hopes of a plentiful &s;upply of every thing we wanted for a long run; but we found our&s;elves mi&s;erably mi&s;taken in almo&s;t every article we expected.</P>
<P>As here are &s;everal fine &s;andy bays, we had very good fi&s;hing with a &s;eine, for mullets, old wives, &s;ting-rays, maids, turbots, and other flat fi&s;h, &s;ilver fi&s;h, ba&s;s, a very boney long fi&s;h like a ba&s;s, but which our &s;eamen call a ten-pounder, and &s;ome other &s;orts. We likewi&s;e had fre&s;h beef for pre&s;ent expending plenty e|nough, but &s;carce better than the carrion that we gave to our dogs. As for lemons, limes, plantains, bananaes, potatoes, and other roots, fruits, and greens, with which tho&s;e climates generally abound, which the authors above mentioned aver to be extremely plentiful here, and which we principally depended on for &s;ea-&s;tores, there were &s;o few at the time of our be|ing here, that I believe we could have con|&s;umed all that came to our knowledge of tho&s;e things in one day. The officers, however, no doubt, found plenty; as Mr. Walters agrees in his report with Frezier, that there was no want of pine-apples, peaches, grapes, lemons, ci|trons, melons, apricots, and adds, there were be&s;ides potatoes and onions for &s;ea-&s;tores. Sa&s;|&s;afra&s;s
<PB N="262" REF="272">
is here in great plenty, and we cut much of it among other wood for fuel. Guaiacum they report to be very plenty here likewi&s;e, but I &s;aw none of it, nor heard of any per&s;on who did during our &s;tay. Rum and &s;ugar they have in &s;mall quantities, but very indifferent and dear. The inhabitants are a mixture of Portu|gue&s;e and Indians incorporated together, and appear to be very poor, idle, lazy, ignorant, and rude. I believe the original of the Portu|gue&s;e here was chiefly from felons, who fled hi|ther from other parts of the Brazils to &s;helter them&s;elves from ju&s;tice; they never till lately having any government among them, except a Chief cho&s;en from among them&s;elves, who was more like a Captain of thieves and robbers, than the Commander of a colony. At pre&s;ent there are &s;ome European Soldiers, and a Gover|nor from Rio Janeiro, who&s;e name was Don Jo&s;&s;e Sylva de Paz, an expert engineer, who, as Mr. Walters ob&s;erves, under&s;tood one branch of his bu&s;ine&s;s very well, which is the advan|tages which new works bring to tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the care of erecting them; for, be&s;ides a battery on a neck of land that nar|rows the channel to a little more than a quar|ter of a mile, there were three other forts car|rying on for the defence of the harbour, none of which were then compleated.</P>
<P>The country, both the main and the i&s;land, is mountainous, and all over-grown with thick
<PB N="263" REF="273">
woods, and tho&s;e &s;o entangled with the under|growth of thorny briars, brambles, and the like, that in mo&s;t places they are &s;carce penetrable. The&s;e woods are reported to be full of very fierce tygers, which makes any excur&s;ions into the country dangerous, unle&s;s you go well arm|ed, and even then much caution is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>They have here &s;ome hogs and fowls, but I believe not very plenty; and in the woods are monkeys, apes, armadilloes, and other wild creatures unknown to me; as al&s;o parrots, par|roquets, and many other &s;orts of birds proper to the climate. Alligators are &s;aid to be plenty near the &s;hores and in the lakes, but we &s;aw none of them.</P>
<P>The country appears to me to be a good &s;oil, and very capable of improvement, were the in|habitants more civilized and indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>This i&s;land lies in latitude 27 deg. 30 min. S. longitude, as before determined, 49 deg. 53 min. W. from London; and the variation of the compa&s;s 11 deg. 20 min. ea&s;terly.</P>

the peace, and made that a pretence for &s;ending Don Pi&s;arro the mo&s;t circum&s;tantial intelligence of our force and condition, as we afterwards found by letters intercepted in the South Seas.</P>
<P>January 18, 1741, we left this i&s;land, having had a melancholy proof how much the healthi|ne&s;s of this place had been over-rated by for|mer writers; for we found, that, though the Centurion alone had buried no le&s;s than 28 men &s;ince our arrival, the number of the &s;ick in the &s;ame interval had increa&s;ed to 96; and this very day we had three men die.</P>
<P>Before our departure the Commodore took every precaution to prevent a &s;eparation; but con&s;idering that, in &s;uch boi&s;terous &s;eas as we were about to encounter, he him&s;elf might be di&s;abled, he called the officers together, and in a full council &s;o ordered it, that, if but one &s;hip e&s;caped, the expedition &s;hould not be a|bandoned. Proper places of rendezvous were ap|pointed; the time was &s;ettled for &s;taying at the&s;e places; and, if the Commodore did not arrive in that time, the Captains were ordered to put them&s;elves under the command of the &s;enior, and to proceed without farther delay.</P>
<P>The 22d in the morning, we had very &s;tormy weather, with &s;ome thunder, lightning, and rain; and the Trial carried away the head of her main-ma&s;t. A thick fog &s;ucceeding, we lay to, and &s;oon after lo&s;t &s;ight of the Pearl, the Trial, and the Anne pink. In the afternoon we got &s;ight of and joined company with the
<PB N="265" REF="275">
Trial and the Anne, but the Pearl was &s;till mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>From hence to February the 13th, very va|riable weather, mo&s;tly foggy, from latitude 35, or thereabouts, to latitude 39; the re&s;t a mix|ture not much unlike our weather in England in the month of October, except that we had pretty often thunder and lightning, which are not &s;o frequent with us in that month. Being pa&s;t the latitude of 36 degrees to the &s;outhward, I ob&s;erved the current, which had hitherto con|&s;tantly &s;et &s;outherly, now on the contrary, &s;et to the northward; and the great river of Rio de la Plata being &s;ituated in between 35 and 36 degrees &s;outh, &s;trengthens my conjecture that tho&s;e currents are occa&s;ioned by the flux and reflux of that mighty river.</P>
<P>February 13, we &s;aw the land from S. by W. to S. half E. appearing plain, with very few ri&s;|ings, and of a very moderate height, our &s;ound|ings at that time from 46 to 56 fathom, the fir&s;t mud, the latter &s;tony ground. This day, at four in the evening, we were within about four miles of Cape Blanco on the coa&s;t of Patagonia, and in 12 fathom water; on which we hauled off, and ran along the coa&s;t, the &s;oundings from 20 to 60 fathom water. At five the next morning we &s;aw the land from W. by N. to S. W. half W. with an opening near the middle; which I believe to be the harbour of Port De|&s;ire, &s;o called by Sir John Narborough. The northernmo&s;t land in &s;ight is Cape Blanco,
<PB N="266" REF="276">
and the &s;outhermo&s;t Penguin I&s;land, &s;o called from the great numbers of penguins about it, of which birds Sir John's &s;hip's company killed and &s;alted large quantities for provi&s;ions, and which he reports to be very good and whole&s;ome food. Cape Blanco is in the latitude of 47 deg. 10 min. S longit. from St. Katharine's 17 deg. 38 min. W. which makes it from London 67 deg. 20 min. W. taking the N. E. point of St. Katharine's in 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> deg. 42 min. W. to be about 11 minutes to the ea&s;tward of the place where the &s;hip lay when I fixed it by ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The 17th, in the evening, we anchored about 17 or 18 leagues &s;hort of the harbour of Port St. Julian, &s;o called by Sir Francis Drake, who touched there in his voyage round the globe, and where he condemned and executed Mr. Doughty, the next per&s;on in command to him|&s;elf, on pretence of a con&s;piracy to murder him and ruin the expedition; whence a &s;mall i&s;land within the harbour is to this day called the I&s;land of True Ju&s;tice. The next morning we &s;aw a &s;ail at S. by E. which we believing to be the Pearl, made the &s;ignal for the return of all cruizers; but &s;he not minding it, as I &s;uppo&s;e not &s;eeing it, we ordered the Glouce&s;ter to cha&s;e, and at two in the afternoon the Glouce&s;ter and her chace, which to our great &s;atisfaction proved to be the Pearl, joined us. They informed us, that, on January the 31&s;t, their Commander, Captain Dandy Kidd, died; and that on the
<PB N="267" REF="277">
7th in&s;tant they were chaced by five large &s;hips, which they believed to be Spani&s;h men-of-war, and were &s;ome time within gun-&s;hot of them, though they never fired a gun, having endea|voured to decoy the Pearl by hoi&s;ting a broad red pendant, like that of the Engli&s;h Commo|dore, at the Admiral's main-top-ma&s;t head, and hoping by that means to be taken for our Com|modore, and &s;o to inveigle and make &s;ure of their prey; Capt. Mitchell, thus decoyed, narrowly e&s;|caped them, by running through a &s;pace of water, where the tides or currents making a great rip|ling, the Spaniards, who thought it was rocky and broken ground, were afraid to follow her. The&s;e &s;hips we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Spani&s;h &s;quadron, commanded by Admiral Pi&s;arro, the &s;ame who got &s;o great a name among them for his con|duct in bringing home their &s;lota &s;afe into Port Andero the la&s;t year, eluding the vigilance of our &s;quadrons who waited for them off Cadiz, and was therefore looked on as the propere&s;t per&s;on to be &s;ent to intercept us. We &s;hould not have been di&s;plea&s;ed, however, to have met them with our whole force, and did not much doubt to have either de&s;troyed or di&s;abled them. But the time of their de&s;truction was not yet come; their mi&s;erable fate &s;hall be related in its proper place.</P>
<P>We were now, being the 18th, &s;ailing along &s;hore for the harbour of St. Julian. I found the tide to &s;et here north and &s;outh, about a mile an hour. The time of flowing here on the
<PB N="268" REF="278">
full and change days is N. E. by E. and S. W. by W. neare&s;t. We &s;ent one of our boats with an officer in-&s;hore, to &s;ound and endeavour to di&s;cover the mouth of the harbour. At &s;ix in the evening we came to an anchor in 12 fathom water. At eight the Lieutenant returned, hav|ing found the harbour. We &s;ent a&s;hore our boats to make farther di&s;coveries, and to endea|vour &s;ome to get fre&s;h water, and others to pro|cure &s;alt, (of which Sir J. Narborough ob&s;erved, when he was here, that in February there was enough of it to load 1000 &s;hips) for the u&s;e of the &s;quadron in the South Seas. We continued here till the 27th, during which time we &s;tove mo&s;t of our empty ca&s;ks, in order to clear our &s;hips as much as po&s;&s;ible, and got up and mounted &s;uch of our guns as we had before &s;truck down into the hold in order to ea&s;e the &s;hips; for now, not knowing how &s;oon we might meet with the Spani&s;h &s;quadron, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have them all in readine&s;s. We could find no fre&s;h water here, and but a very &s;mall quantity of &s;alt, and no other refre&s;hments whatever; all the country, as far as we could di&s;cover, being quite barren and de&s;olate. We got &s;ome provi&s;ions out of the Anne victualler on board each of the other &s;hips, repaired the Trial's ma&s;t, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her and the victualler to overhaul and new-fix mo&s;t of their rigging. Having lo&s;t the hopes of a &s;upply of water here, we were put to the allowance of one quart a man for one day, and three pints for
<PB N="269" REF="279">
another, alternately; but, con&s;idering our pa&s;|&s;age had hitherto proved extremely &s;tormy and cold, and a dead time of the year coming on very fa&s;t, it was thought proper, in order to keep the people in as good heart as po&s;&s;ible, to give them whole allowance of all other provi|&s;ions, which was ordered accordingly.</P>
<P>Here we farther &s;ecured our lower-deck guns, by nailing quoins under the trucks, in ca&s;e the tackles, breechings, or iron-work, might give way, or fail in the &s;tormy weather, which we had much rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>Here likewi&s;e the Commodore removed the Honourable Captain Murray into the Pearl, in the room of Captain Kidd; and Captain Cheap into the Wager in the room of Captain Murray. He advanced Mr. Charles Saunders, his Fir&s;t Lieutenant, to be Commander of the Trial &s;loop, in the room of Captain Cheap; and made Mr. Piercy Brett, Fir&s;t Lieutenant of the Glouce&s;ter, Second Lieutenant of his own &s;hip. The Trial being repaired, and the Pearl, who had thrown about 14 ton of water overboard when chaced by the Spaniards, being &s;upplied from the other &s;hips, we made ready to pro&s;ecute our voyage.</P>
<P>This harbour of Port St. Julian is a barred harbour, only fit to receive &s;mall &s;hips and ve&s;|&s;els. We lay off in the road about two miles from the mouth of it. It is not to be &s;een open from where we lay, one point &s;hutting in ano|ther; and before any &s;mall &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el pre|tends to venture into the harbour, they ought
<PB N="270" REF="280">
to &s;end in their boats at low water, and fix poles or buoys on the ends of the &s;hoals, which, in a manner, block up the pa&s;&s;age. The country about it is pretty much on the level, except a few copling hillocks to the northward, and a pretty high one in the bay, which bears W.S.W. from the place where we lay at anchor. The la|titude of Port St. Julian is 49 deg. 10 min. S. its longitude from London 69 deg. 48 min. W. and the variation of the compa&s;s 17 deg. 20 min. E. We had here uncertain boi&s;terous weather, with much rain, &s;ome &s;now, and generally thick fog, with &s;o much wind and &s;ea as made us ride hard, and ha&s;tened our departure from this un|ea&s;y &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Sir John Narborough and &s;ome others write, that they have often &s;een and conver&s;ed with the inhabitants in this and other parts of Patagonia, and have given wonderful de&s;criptions of them; but as we &s;aw none of them, I have nothing to &s;ay of that &s;ort, nor indeed do I think there is any thing in this wild part of the world worthy of the lea&s;t notice.</P>
<P>The 27th, at &s;ix in the morning, we made the &s;ignal, weighed, and put to &s;ea; but the Glou|ce&s;ter being long in weighing her anchor, and the weather proving thick and hazy, we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of her, and at one in the afternoon, tacked, and lay by for her coming up; at &s;even we fired a gun, a &s;ignal for her, and &s;oon after &s;he joined us, having broke her main-yard in the &s;lings.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="281">Previous to our leaving this port, a council was held on board the Centurion, at which all the officers by &s;ea and land attended, when it was propo&s;ed by the Commodore, that their fir&s;t attempt, after their arrival in the South Seas, &s;hould be the attack of the town of Bal|divia, the principal frontier of the di&s;trict of Chili. To this propo&s;ition the council unani|mou&s;ly agreed; in con&s;equence of which, new in&s;tructions were given to the Captains of the &s;quadron, by which they were directed, in ca&s;e of &s;eparation, to rendezvous at the i&s;land of Neu&s;tra Senoro del Secoro, and there crui&s;e for 10 days; after which, they were ordered to re|pair to the height of Baldivia, and there be|tween 40 deg. and 40 deg. 30 min. to continue to crui&s;e 14 days longer; and, if in that time they were not joined by the re&s;t of the &s;quadron, they were then to quit that &s;tation, and direct their cour&s;e to the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez.</P>
<P>March the 4th, in the morning, we pa&s;&s;ed by the Streights of Magellan, &s;o near that we &s;aw them very plain; the northernmo&s;t point of which, known by the name of Cape Virgin Mary, I found to be in the latitude of 52 deg. 28 min. S. longitude from London 70 deg. 55 min. W. variation of the compa&s;s 18 deg. 40 min. E. the &s;oundings, when it bears about S. W. by W. at the di&s;tance of eight leagues, from 32 to 50 fathom, the bottom black-grey &s;and and mud. The afternoon of this day be|ing very bright and clear, with &s;mall breezes,
<PB N="272" REF="282">
inclinable to calm, mo&s;t of the Captains took the opportunity of this favourable weather to pay a vi&s;it to the Commodore; but, while they were in company together, they were all great|ly alarmed by a &s;udden flame which bur&s;t out on board the Centurion, and which was &s;uc|ceeded by a cloud of &s;moak. However, they were &s;oon relieved from their apprehen&s;ions, by receiving information, that the bla&s;t was occa|&s;ioned by a &s;park of fire from the forge light|ing on &s;ome gunpowder, and other combu&s;tibles, which the officers on board were preparing for u&s;e, in ca&s;e we &s;hould fall in with the Spani&s;h fleet; and that it had been extingui&s;hed with|out any danger to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>The 6th, in the morning, we &s;aw the land of Terra del Fuego, con&s;i&s;ting of high craggy hills, towering above each other, mo&s;tly covered with &s;now, with deep horrid vallies, &s;ome few &s;catter|ed trees, no plains, nor one chearful green through all the di&s;mal pro&s;pect; &s;o that the whole may not improperly be termed the Land of De&s;olation; and I much que&s;tion whether a more dreary a&s;pect is to be &s;een in any other part of the habitable earth; for voyagers &s;ay this is inhabited, but &s;urely its inhabitants mu&s;t be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of human beings. This evening we lay by, that we might not over&s;hoot the Streights of Le Maire in the night; though I believe, had we kept on, and pa&s;&s;ed round Staten Land, a &s;mall i&s;land or two, which lie to the ea&s;tward of tho&s;e Streights, and together
<PB N="273" REF="283">
with Terra del Fuego frame them, it would have been more to our advantage than by pa&s;|&s;ing through them.</P>
<P>The 7th, at eight in the morning, we were very near a point of land on Terra del Fuego, called Cape St James, bearing E. S. E. another called Cape St. Vincent, S. E. half E. the mid|dlemo&s;t of the Three Brothers, being three high hills on Terra del Fuego, appearing almo&s;t con|tiguous to each other, S. by W. and a very high Sugar-loaf Hill, called Monte Gorda, farther up in the country, and appearing above them, bore &s;outh from us. It is by the&s;e marks that you know you are near Strait Le Maire; and in|deed we began to open them in this po&s;ition. By noon we were almo&s;t through them, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a very &s;trong tide with much rippling, and which made to the &s;outhward &s;omewhat before 10 o'clock in the morning. The cour&s;e through is almo&s;t directly &s;outh, and there are no &s;hoals nor rocks in the pa&s;&s;age from whence you may incur any danger; the only thing you have to fear is, the tide's turning again&s;t you while you are in the &s;traits, for in that ca&s;e you are certainly hurried back again, and can have no pa&s;&s;age there till the next turn of the tide. The breadth of this &s;trait may be about &s;ix or &s;even leagues, and its length about &s;even or eight; which being pa&s;&s;ed, you enter into a va&s;t open ocean, commonly known by the name of the South Sea. This &s;trait lies in latitude 55 deg. &s;outh, longitude from London 67 deg.
<PB N="274" REF="284">
30 min. we&s;t, variation of the compa&s;s 21 deg. 36 min. ea&s;t, &s;oundings in the &s;traits from 43 to 58 fathom, the bottom black &s;and and peb|ble-&s;tones. In pa&s;&s;ing through here, our joy was increa&s;ed by the brightne&s;s of the &s;ky and the &s;erenity of the weather, which was indeed remarkably plea&s;ing, for though the winter was now advancing apace, yet the morning of this day, in its brilliancy and mildne&s;s, gave place to none we had &s;een &s;ince our departure from England. But we here found what was con|&s;tantly verified by all our ob&s;ervations in the&s;e high latitudes, that fair weather was ever the forerunner of a &s;ucceeding &s;torm, and that &s;un|&s;hine and tempe&s;t followed one another like light and &s;hade. We had &s;carcely reached the &s;outhern extremity of the &s;traits, when the &s;ere|nity of the &s;ky, which had &s;o much flattered our expectations, was all at once ob&s;cured, the wind &s;hifted to the &s;outhward, and the &s;ea be|gan to &s;well to an a&s;toni&s;hing height. Before night the tempe&s;t aro&s;e, and the tide, which had hitherto favoured us, turned furiou&s;ly again&s;t us; &s;o that, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing our in|tended cour&s;e, we were driven to the ea&s;tward, by the united force of wind and current, with &s;o much precipitation, that in the morning we found our&s;elves &s;even leagues to the ea&s;tward of Streight Le Maire. From this time we had &s;uch a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tempe&s;tuous weather as &s;urprized the olde&s;t and mo&s;t ex|perienced mariners on board, and obliged them
<PB N="275" REF="285">
to confe&s;s, that what they had hitherto called &s;torms were incon&s;iderable gales compared with the violence of the&s;e winds, which rai&s;ed &s;uch &s;hort and at the &s;ame time &s;uch mountainous waves, as greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in danger all &s;eas known in any other part of the globe: and it was not without rea&s;on that this unu&s;ual ap|pearance filled us with continual terror; for, had any one of the&s;e waves broke fairly over us, it mu&s;t in all probability have &s;ent us to the bottom. Nor did we e&s;cape with terror only; for the &s;hip rolling ince&s;&s;antly gunwale to, gave us &s;uch quick and violent motions, that the men were in perpetual danger of being da&s;hed again&s;t the ma&s;ts or &s;ides of the &s;hip: and though we were extremely careful to &s;ecure our&s;elves from the&s;e &s;hocks by gra&s;ping at &s;ome fixed body, yet many of our people were forced from their holds, &s;ome of whom were killed, and others greatly injured; in particular, one of our be&s;t &s;eamen was carried over-board and drowned, another di&s;located his neck, a third was thrown into the main hold, and broke his thigh, and one of our boat&s;wain's mates broke his collar-bone twice; not to mention many other accidents of the &s;ame kind. The&s;e tem|pe&s;ts, &s;o dreadful in them&s;elves, though unat|tended by any other unfavourable circum&s;tance, were rendered more mi&s;chievous to us by their inequality, and the deceitful intervals which they at &s;ome times afforded; for, though we were often obliged to lie to for days together
<PB N="276" REF="286">
under a reefed mizzen, and were frequently re|duced to lie at the mercy of the waves under our bare poles, yet now and then we ventured to make &s;ail with our cour&s;es double reefed; and the weather proving more tolerable, would perhaps encourage us to &s;et our top-&s;ails; after which, the wind, without any previous notice, would return upon us with redoubled force, and would in an in&s;tant tear our &s;ails from the yards. And, that no circum&s;tance might be wanting which could aggravate our di&s;tre&s;s, the&s;e bla&s;ts generally brought with them a great quantity of &s;now and &s;leet, which ca&s;ed our rigging, and froze our &s;ails, thereby rendering them and our cordage brittle, and apt to &s;nap upon the &s;lighte&s;t &s;train, adding inexpre&s;&s;ible difficulty and labour to the working of the &s;hip, benumbing the limbs of the people em|ployed in handing the &s;ails, or handling the ropes, and making them incapable of exerting them&s;elves with their u&s;ual activity, and even di&s;|abling many by mortifying their toes and fingers.</P>
<P>And now, as it were to add the fini&s;hing &s;troke to our misfortunes, our people began to be univer&s;ally afflicted with that mo&s;t terrible, ob&s;tinate, and, at &s;ea, incurable di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;curvy, which quickly made a mo&s;t dreadful havock among us, beginning at fir&s;t to carry off two or three a day, but &s;oon increa&s;ing, and at la&s;t carrying off eight or ten; and as mo&s;t of the living were very ill of the &s;ame di&s;temper,

and the little remainder who pre&s;erved their healths better, in a manner, quite worn out with ince&s;&s;ant labour, I have &s;ometimes &s;een four or five dead bodies, &s;ome &s;own up in their ham|mocks, others not, wa&s;hing about the decks, for want of help to bury them in the &s;ea. But as the particulars of all the various di&s;a&s;ters and &s;ufferings of various kinds that befel us, would be endle&s;s, I &s;hall only mention a few.</P>
<P>The 10th, 11th, and 12th, very &s;tormy wea|ther, with &s;now and &s;leet, and a very great over|grown &s;ea from the S. W.</P>
<P>The 15th, one William Baker fell overboard and was drowned. The 16th, the Anne pink, which had &s;eparated from us the 11th in the &s;torm, again joined us, in lat. 59 deg. 20 min. S.</P>
<P>Part of the 17th, 18th, and 19th, very &s;trong gales, and a great rolling &s;ea from the N. W.</P>
<P>The 18th, we had again &s;trong gales of wind with extreme cold, and at midnight the main-top-&s;ail &s;plit, and one of the &s;traps of the main dead-eyes broke.</P>
<P>The 23d, and part of the 24th, a mo&s;t vio|lent &s;torm of wind, hail, and rain, with a very lofty &s;ea. The 23d, in the evening, we &s;prung the main-top-&s;ail yard, and &s;plit the main-&s;ail into rags, the greate&s;t part of which was blown overboard. On the&s;e accidents we furled all our other &s;ails, and lay-to under a mizzen.</P>
<P>The latter part of the 24th proving more mo|derate, we bent a new main-&s;ail, got down the
<PB N="278" REF="288">
broken main top-&s;ail yard, and got up and rig|ged another in its place.</P>
<P>The 25th, it blew a very hurricane, and re|duced us to the nece&s;&s;ity of lying-to under our bare poles. As our &s;hip kept the wind better than any of the re&s;t, we were obliged in the af|ternoon to wear &s;hip; in doing of which, we had no other expedient but clapping the helm a-weather, and manning the fore-&s;hrouds; in the execution of which we had one of our be&s;t men canted overboard. We perceived, that, not|with&s;tanding the prodigious agitation of the waves, he &s;wam very &s;trong; and it was with the utmo&s;t concern that we found our&s;elves in|capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him. Indeed we were the more grieved at his unhappy fate, as we lo&s;t &s;ight of him &s;truggling with the waves, and conceiv|ed, from the manner in which he &s;wam, that he might continue &s;en&s;ible for a con&s;iderable time longer of the horror attending his irretrievable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The 26th being &s;omewhat more moderate, we found two of our main-&s;hrouds broke, which we repaired; we likewi&s;e bent our main-top-&s;ail, and made &s;ail.</P>
<P>The 30th, in the evening, the Glouce&s;ter made a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s; and, on &s;peaking with her, we found &s;he had broke her main-yard in the &s;lings; an accident the more grievous, as it tended unavoidably to delay us in the&s;e inho&s;|pitable latitudes, where every moment we were in danger of peri&s;hing. The weather proving
<PB N="279" REF="289">
favourable, all the carpenters were ordered on board the Glouce&s;ter, and next day &s;he was ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P>The 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th of April, a conti|nued &s;torm of wind and rain; a dreadful &s;ea, and very cold weather. We lowered our yards, furled our cour&s;es, and lay by for the mo&s;t part under a mizzen and mizzen-&s;tay &s;ail. The 3d, about 11 o'clock at night, a raging &s;ea took us on the larboard quarter, where it &s;tove in the quarter gallery, and ru&s;hed into the &s;hip like a deluge. For &s;ome time it laid the &s;hip down upon her &s;ide; but &s;he providentially righted again, though &s;lowly; it threw down and half drowned all the people on the deck, broke one of the &s;traps of the main dead-eyes, and &s;haped a mizzen and puttock &s;hroud. This was the greate&s;t &s;ea which we had encountered &s;ince we came into tho&s;e parts, and we met with but one &s;uch &s;troke more in the whole voyage; two or three &s;uch &s;ucceeding mu&s;t certainly have &s;ent us to the bottom.</P>
<P>The 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th, continued very &s;tormy and &s;qually, with &s;now, hail, rain, and a large &s;ea; the weather continuing very cold.</P>
<P>The 8th, at four in the evening, the Anne pink made a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s; and, on &s;peak|ing with her, we found &s;he had &s;prung her fore|&s;tay, and the gammoning of her bow&s;prit. This was the more unfortunate, as none of the car|penters were yet returned from the Glouce&s;ter. Nor was the Anne the only &s;hip that &s;uffered in
<PB N="280" REF="290">
this &s;torm; the Wager lo&s;t her mizzen-ma&s;t and main-top-&s;ail yard, owing to the badne&s;s of the iron work. In this dilemma we were obliged to bear away till the&s;e &s;hips had made all fa&s;t.</P>
<P>The 10th, foggy and hazy. This afternoon the Severn and Pearl were far a-&s;tern, and &s;eem|ed to me to lag de&s;ignedly. We made a very ea&s;y &s;ail all day, and lay by at night, and fired &s;everal guns as a &s;ignal for them to join us; the weather being pretty moderate, and the wind fair for them, they might have effected it with ea&s;e. By the clo&s;e of the evening we could but ju&s;t &s;ee them, and from that time &s;aw them no more. However, we heard afterwards in the South Seas, by letters taken on board &s;ome of the Spani&s;h &s;hips, of their arrival at Rio Janeiro, in the Brazils.</P>
<P>The 15th, the weather proved &s;omewhat more moderate. At half an hour pa&s;t one in the morning we &s;aw two i&s;lands right a-head, at about two leagues di&s;tance; we immediately wore our &s;hip, and &s;tood off to the &s;outhward. Tho&s;e i&s;lands were very unexpected, as well as unwelcome, we imagining we had been to the we&s;tward of all lands and i&s;lands of the coa&s;t of Terra del Fuego; but we now found our mi&s;|take, and that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of our &s;tand|ing farther to the &s;outhward, in order to get a &s;ufficient we&s;ting. Tho&s;e i&s;lands I find to lie in the latitude of 54 deg. 20 min. S. longitude from London 84 deg. 10 min. W. Mr. Wal|ters &s;uppo&s;es the land we fell in with on this
<PB N="281" REF="291">
occa&s;ion to be Cape Noir, and a part of Terra dei Fuego.</P>
<P>From this time to the 23d we had nothing remarkable, the weather continuing very uncer|tain and variable, with a large &s;ea and a very cold air; and the 21&s;t, at nine at night, we were in the latitude of 60 deg. 5 min. S. being the greate&s;t &s;outh latitude we made during the voyage.</P>
<P>The 23d very hard gales and &s;qualls, with much rain. This evening we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Glouce&s;ter, Wager, Trial, and Anne Pink, be|ing all the remainder of our &s;quadron, after the defection of the Severn and Pearl. The Wager's unfortunate cata&s;trophe is well known; the others afterwards joined us at Juan Fernan|dez, as &s;hall be related in its proper place.</P>
<P>The 24th, 25th, and 26th, the wind being mo&s;tly fair, though &s;till blowing hard, we made pretty good runs under an ea&s;y &s;ail to the north|we&s;tward. The 24th, it blew a hurricane, and the men endeavouring to hand the top-&s;ails, the clew-lines and bunt lines broke, and the &s;heet being half flown, every &s;eam in the fore-top&s;ail was &s;oon &s;plit from top to bottom, and the main-top&s;ail &s;hook &s;o &s;trongly in the wind, that it carried away the top lanthorn, and endangered the head of the ma&s;t; however, at length, &s;ome of the mo&s;t dar|ing of our men ventured upon the yard, and cut the &s;ail away clo&s;e to the reefs, though with the utmo&s;t hazard of their lives, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time the fore-top&s;ail beat about the yard with
<PB N="282" REF="292">
&s;o much fury that it was &s;oon blown to &s;hreds: nor was our attention to our top&s;ails our &s;ole employment; for the main&s;ail blew loo&s;e, which obliged us to lower the yard to &s;ecure the &s;ail, and the fore-yard being likewi&s;e lowered, we lay to under a mizen. The 25th, we found much of our running rigging broken, which we repaired. The 27th, we bent other top&s;ails in the places of tho&s;e &s;plit. Nothing more re|markable the re&s;t of this month and the fir&s;t week in the next, but &s;tormy uncertain wea|ther, and great &s;ickne&s;s and mortality among our people.</P>
<P>Friday, May 8, at &s;even in the morning, &s;aw the main land of Patagonia appearing in high mountains covered mo&s;tly with &s;now. We likewi&s;e &s;aw &s;everal i&s;lands, one of which we took to be the I&s;land del Soccoro, &s;o called by Sir John Narborough, in his account of his voyage into tho&s;e parts; and from the fine de|&s;cription this gentleman had given of this i&s;land, (having been there in the very height of &s;um|mer), this place was appointed for our fir&s;t gene|ral rendezvous in the South Seas. An unhappy appointment it was in its con&s;equences; for when the people, already reduced to the la&s;t ex|tremity, found this to be the place of rendez|vous, where they had hoped to meet the re&s;t of their companions with joy, and what a mi&s;erable part of the world it appeared to be, their grief gave way to de&s;pair; they &s;aw no end of their &s;uf|ferings, nor any door open to their &s;afety. Tho&s;e
<PB N="283" REF="293">
who had hitherto been well and in heart, now full of de&s;pondency, fell down, &s;ickened, and died; and, to &s;um up this melancholy part, I verily believe, that our touching on this coa&s;t, the long &s;tay we made here, and our hinderance by cro&s;s winds, which we &s;hould have avoided in a direct cour&s;e to Juan Fernandez, lo&s;t us at lea&s;t 60 or 70 of as &s;tout and able men as any in the navy. This un&s;peakable di&s;tre&s;s was &s;till aggravated by the difficulties we found in work|ing the &s;hip, as the &s;curvy had by this time de|&s;troyed no le&s;s than 200 of our men, and had in &s;ome degree affected almo&s;t the whole crew. It were, indeed, endle&s;s to recite minutely the various di&s;a&s;ters, fatigues, and terrors, which we encountered on this coa&s;t; all the&s;e went on in|crea&s;ing till the 22d of May, at which time the fury of all the &s;torms which we had hitherto ex|perienced, &s;eemed to be combined, and to have con&s;pired our de&s;truction. In this hurricane al|mo&s;t all our &s;ails were &s;plit, and great part of our &s;tanding rigging broken; and, about eight in the evening, a mountainous overgrown &s;ea took us on our &s;tarboard quarter, and gave us &s;o prodigious a &s;hock, that &s;everal of our &s;hrouds broke with the jerk, by which our ma&s;ts were in danger of coming by the board; our balla&s;t and &s;tores too were &s;o &s;trangely &s;hifted, that the &s;hip heeled afterwards two &s;treaks a-port. Indeed, it was a mo&s;t tremendous blow, and we were thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, from the apprehen&s;ion of in&s;tantly foundering. Our de|plorable
<PB N="284" REF="294">
&s;ituation allowing no longer any room for deliberation, we &s;tood for the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez; and, to &s;ave time, which was now very precious, our men dying four, five, and &s;ix in a day, we endeavoured to hit the i&s;land upon a meridian cour&s;e. On the 28th of May, being nearly in the parallel in which it is laid down, we expected to have &s;een it, and indeed the Com|modore was per&s;uaded that he did &s;ee it; but all the other officers being of opinion that it was only a cloud, to which the hazine&s;s of the wea|ther gave too much colour, we made &s;ail to the ea&s;tward, and by &s;o doing lo&s;t near 14 days in recovering our we&s;ting again. This was a mo&s;t fatal di&s;appointment; for in this run we lo&s;t about 80 of our men, which, probably, had the Commodore's advice been attended to, would mo&s;t of them have been &s;aved.</P>
<P>The 8th of June, at &s;ix in the evening, we at length &s;aw the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, bearing N. by E. half E. about 15 or 16 leagues off. The 10th, at two in the morning, we an|chored in 56 fathom, clo&s;e under the N. E. end of the i&s;land. At 10 in the morning of the 11th, we with much labour and difficulty weighed our anchor, and at noon happily moored our &s;hip in the Great Bay, about a mile from the &s;hore, in 52 fathom water, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, hav|ing been from St. Katharine's in the Brazils to this place 148 days, on &s;uch a dreadful and fa|tal pa&s;&s;age as I believe very few other per&s;ons ever experienced.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="295">The 11th, at two in the afternoon, the Trial &s;loop appeared in the offing. We immediately &s;ent &s;ome of our hands on board her, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he was brought to an anchor between us and the land. We &s;oon found that the &s;loop had not been exempted from the like calamities which we had &s;o &s;everely felt; for her Com|mander, Captain Saunders, waiting on the Com|modore, informed him, that, out of his &s;mall complement, he had buried 34 of his men; and tho&s;e who recovered were &s;o univer&s;ally afflicted with the &s;curvy, that only him&s;elf, his Lieute|nant, and three of his men, were able to &s;tand by the &s;ails.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day we got out our long-boat, and &s;ent her on &s;hore with materials for building tents for the &s;ick, and with orders to bring on board &s;ome water.</P>
<P>The 15th, we &s;ent our pinnace to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Trial, &s;he being driven from her anchors to &s;ea, by the violent flaws of wind which blow off the high lands. This and the next day we put a&s;hore 75 &s;ick men, in &s;o weak a condition, that we were obliged to carry them out of the &s;hip in their hammocks, and to convey them afterwards in the &s;ame manner from the water-&s;ide over a &s;toney beach to the tents prepared for their re|ception. In this work of humanity, not only the officers, but the Commodore him&s;elf, chear|fully lent their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The 17th, the Trial came again to an anchor, and moored. This day and the next we &s;ent
<PB N="286" REF="296">
on &s;hore the remainder of our &s;ick people, the whole number now on &s;hore being 135, many of whom, being too far gone in the &s;curvy, died one after another to the number of not le&s;s than &s;ixty.</P>
<P>We now began to &s;end on &s;hore materials for tents for the coopers, &s;ail-makers, and &s;ome of the officers; a copper oven which we had with us for baking &s;oft bread for the &s;hip's company, and the &s;mith's forge for making or repairing &s;uch iron-work as was nece&s;&s;ary: and, after a &s;hort interval of relaxation, all hands were bu&s;ily employed, &s;ome in cutting large quantities of wood for the &s;hip's u&s;e, &s;ome in making char|coal for the &s;mith, and for a farther &s;tore; the bakers in baking bread, the coopers in making up and cleaning the ca&s;ks for water, the &s;ail-makers in mending the &s;ails and making others; &s;ome in fi&s;hing for the &s;ick, and the re&s;t were otherways employed: and here being very great plenty of fine fi&s;h, all taken by the hook, two or three people could never fail to take us as much in about two hours as all the &s;hip's company could eat: be&s;ides this we took great quantities for &s;alting and curing; and &s;ome private per|&s;ons who had hooks and lines fi&s;hed for them|&s;elves, and never failed of enough for their own u&s;e, and to give to tho&s;e who had none. The people on board were employed in cleaning the &s;hip, which was in a very filthy condition, and in &s;tripping the ma&s;ts, and overhauling the rig|ging. One of the boat&s;wain's mates, with &s;ome
<PB N="287" REF="297">
a&s;&s;i&s;tants, having run up a rope-walk on &s;hore, was employed in making what &s;mall cordage we might want; others in watering, and, in &s;hort, in every thing that might contribute to put us in as good a condition, and in as &s;hort a time as po&s;&s;ible; and as fa&s;t as the &s;ick recovered, they were put on the like employments.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t &s;ight of this i&s;land, it appeared with a mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect, being extremely mountainous, rugged, and irregular; but, upon our nearer approach, it improved upon us; and when we were landed, we found all the vege|tables which are u&s;ually e&s;teemed to be pecu|liarly adapted to the cure of tho&s;e &s;corbutic di&s;|orders which are contracted by &s;alt diet, and long continuance at &s;ea; for here we found wa|ter-cre&s;&s;es and pur&s;lain, wild-&s;orrel, and Sicilian-radi&s;hes, in profu&s;ion. The&s;e vegetables, not to mention the turneps which now abound in every plain, with the fi&s;h and fle&s;h we got here, were not only grateful to us in the extreme, but were likewi&s;e very refre&s;hing to the &s;ick, and contributed not a little to the recovery of tho&s;e who were not already too far advanced in the di&s;order to admit of relief; and to the re&s;toring of others to their wonted vigour, who, though not apparently under the malignancy of the di&s;temper, and its baneful concomitants, were yet greatly debilitated by continual watching and anxiety of mind, from which not a &s;oul on board was exempt.</P>
<P>During the time of our re&s;idence here, we
<PB N="288" REF="298">
found the inland parts of the i&s;land no ways to fall &s;hort of the &s;anguine prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions we had fir&s;t entertained in its favour; for the woods, which covered mo&s;t of the &s;teepe&s;t hills, were free from all bu&s;hes and underwood, and afford|ed an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age through every part of them; and the irregularities of the hills and precipices, in the northern part of the i&s;land, nece&s;&s;arily traced out, by their various combinations, a great number of romantic vallies, mo&s;t of which had a &s;tream of the cleare&s;t water running through them, that tumbled in ca&s;cades from rock to rock, as the bottom of the valley by the cour&s;e of the neighbouring hills was at any time broken into a &s;udden &s;harp de&s;cent. Some particular &s;pots occurred in the&s;e vallies, where the &s;hades and fragrance of the contiguous woods, the loftine&s;s of the over-hanging rocks, and the tran&s;parency and frequent falls of the neigh|bouring &s;treams, pre&s;ented &s;cenes of &s;uch ele|gance and dignity, as would with difficulty be rivalled in any other part of the globe. It is in this place, perhaps, that the &s;imple productions of una&s;&s;i&s;ted nature may be &s;aid to excel all the fictitious de&s;criptions of the mo&s;t animated ima|gination. The &s;pot where the Commodore pitched his tent, and where he cho&s;e, during his &s;tay, to fix his re&s;idence, exceeded in beauty any thing that words can be &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent. It was a delightful little lawn, that lay on an ea&s;y a&s;cent at the di&s;tance of about half a mile from the &s;ea, and was probably the very &s;pot on

which Shelvock twenty years before had pitched his tent. In front there was a large avenue cut through the woods to the &s;ea-&s;ide, which &s;lop|ing to the water with a gentle de&s;cent, opened a pro&s;pect to the bay and the &s;hips at anchor. This lawn was &s;creened behind by a tall wood of myrtle, &s;weeping round it in the form of a theatre, the &s;lope on which the wood &s;tood ri&s;ing with a much &s;harper a&s;cent than the lawn it&s;elf, though not &s;o much but that the hills and pre|cipices within land towered up con&s;iderably above the tops of the trees, and added to the grandeur of the view. There were, be&s;ides, two &s;treams of chry&s;tal water, which ran on the right and left of the tent, within an hundred yards di&s;tance, and were &s;haded by the trees that &s;kirted the lawn on either &s;ide, and com|pleted the &s;ymmetry of the whole. Add to the&s;e, the gentle murmuring of the di&s;tant brooks, the mu&s;ic of the birds among the myrtles, the &s;weet aromatic odour of the &s;pice-trees that every where perfumed the air with their fragrance, and you may form in imagination a faint idea of this &s;econd paradi&s;e, which could only be exceeded by the perfection of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing, that, among all the voyagers who have vi&s;ited this fortunate i&s;land before us, and who have obliged the world with de&s;crip|tions of it, none of them have mentioned a charming little bird that, with its wild, various, and irregular notes, enchants the ear, and makes the woods re&s;ound with its melody. This untu|tored
<PB N="290" REF="301">
choiri&s;ter is &s;omewhat le&s;s in &s;ize than the goldfinch, its plumage beautifully intermixed with red and other vivid colours, and the gold|en crown upon its head &s;o bright and glowing, when &s;een in the full light of the &s;un, that it &s;urpa&s;&s;es all de&s;cription. The&s;e little birds are far from being uncommon or unfamiliar; for they perched upon the branches of the myrtle-trees &s;o near us, and &s;ung &s;o chearfully, as if they had been con&s;cious we were &s;trangers, and came to give us welcome.</P>
<P>There is, be&s;ides the above, another little bird, unnoticed by any former writer, and which &s;eems likewi&s;e peculiar to the i&s;land, and con&s;e|quently without a name; it is &s;till le&s;s than the former in &s;ize, but not inferior in beauty, tho' not &s;o mu&s;ical; the back, wings, and head, are of a lively green, intermixed with fine &s;hining golden &s;pots, and the belly a &s;now white ground, with ebony coloured &s;pots, &s;o elegantly varied as no art can imitate. To the catalogue of birds mentioned by former writers as inhabi|tants of this i&s;land, &s;hould al&s;o be added black birds and thru&s;hes very like tho&s;e in England; and owls, but of a diminutive &s;ize.</P>
<P>Of four-footed animals we &s;aw none but dogs, cats, rats, and goats; and of the latter but few, as the dogs of various kinds, grey|hounds, ma&s;tifs, pointers, &s;paniels, and mun|grels, have thinned them in the plains, and driv|en them to the inacce&s;&s;ible mountains; yet &s;ome
<PB N="291" REF="302">
were &s;hot by the hunters, and were preferred by them to the be&s;t veni&s;on. Among tho&s;e pre&s;ented to the Commodore were two or three venerable through age, that had been marked more than thirty years before by Selkirk, who trained them for his &s;port, &s;lit their ears, and turned them loo&s;e to graze the mountains.</P>
<P>I remember we had once an opportunity of ob|&s;erving a remarkable di&s;pute betwixt a herd of tho&s;e animals and a number of dogs; for going in our boat into the ea&s;tern bay we perceived &s;ome dogs run very eagerly upon the foot, and being willing to di&s;cover what game they were af|ter, we lay upon our oars &s;ome time to view them, and at la&s;t &s;aw them take a hill, where, look|ing a little farther, we ob&s;erved upon the ridge of it an herd of goats, which &s;eemed drawn up for their reception. There was a very narrow path &s;kirted on each &s;ide by precipices, in which the leader of the herd po&s;ted him&s;elf fronting the enemy, the re&s;t of the goats being ranged behind him where the ground was more open; as this &s;pot was inacce&s;&s;ible by any other path, excepting where this champion had placed him&s;elf, the dogs, though they ran up hill with great alacrity, yet when they came within about twenty yards, found they dur&s;t not encounter this formidable Goliah, for he would infallibly have driven the fir&s;t that approached him down the precipice; they therefore quietly laid them|&s;elves down, panting, and did not offer to &s;tir while we remained in &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="303">The&s;e dogs have multiplied prodigiou&s;ly, and have de&s;troyed mo&s;t of the cats as well as goats: the rats, however, keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and were very trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts in the night, when they generally paid us their vi&s;its. It is not ea&s;y to determine in what manner &s;uch a multitude of dogs &s;ub&s;i&s;t, as they are much more numerous than all the other four-footed creatures upon the i&s;land. Our people, indeed, were inclined to think, that they lived in a great mea&s;ure upon the young &s;ea-lions and &s;eals, and &s;upported their opinion by the report of the &s;ailors, &s;ome of whom killed the dogs for food, who &s;aid they ta&s;ted fi&s;hy: and, truly, there is hardly any other way of accounting for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the&s;e animals; for, as has been &s;aid, they have already de&s;troyed all the goats in the ac|ce&s;&s;ible parts of the country; &s;o that there now remain only a few among the crags and pre|cipices, where the dogs cannot follow them. The&s;e are divided into &s;eparate herds of 20 or 30 each, which inhabit di&s;tinct fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, and never mingle with each other; by this means we found it extremely difficult to kill them, and yet we were &s;o de&s;irous of their fle&s;h, that we di&s;co|vered, I believe, all their herds, and it was thought, by comparing their numbers, that they &s;carcely exceeded 200 upon the whole i&s;land. The dogs had de&s;troyed the pardellas, too, of which former writers have given a large ac|count, &s;o that there was not one of them to be &s;een; we found indeed their boroughs in the
<PB N="293" REF="304">
earth, which leaves no room to doubt of their being found in plenty in Selkirk's time, as well as cats, of which there is now &s;carce one alive.</P>
<P>Fle&s;h meat being thus extremely &s;carce, our people, being tired of fi&s;h, though excellent in their kind, at length conde&s;cended to eat &s;eals, which, by degrees, they came to reli&s;h, and called them lamb. Of the&s;e, it being their brooding time, the numbers were incredible;&mdash;and likewi&s;e of the &s;ea-lion&mdash;the&s;e animals have frequently furious battles among them|&s;elves, principally about their females; and we were one day &s;urprized by the &s;ight of two animals, which, at fir&s;t, &s;eemed different from all we had ever ob&s;erved; but, on a nearer ap|proach, they proved to be two &s;ea-lions that had been goring one another with their tu&s;hes, and were covered with blood, with which they plentifully abound. This led us to watch them more clo&s;ely, and one was ob&s;erved larger than the re&s;t, and from his driving off other males, and keeping a great number of females to him|&s;elf, he was by the &s;eamen humorou&s;ly &s;tiled the Ba&s;haw. To this pre-eminence, however, he had not arrived without many bloody con|te&s;ts; for, on our people's attacking him in the mid&s;t of his &s;eraglio of females, he made a de&s;perate defence, and, when overpowered, the &s;ignals of his bravery appeared in numerous &s;cars on every part of his body.</P>
<P>We had now been ten days on this i&s;land, when &s;ome of our people from an eminence di&s;|cerned
<PB N="294" REF="305">
a &s;hip to leeward with her cour&s;es even with the horizon, without any other &s;ail abroad than her main top&s;ail; from which circum|&s;tance, it was immediately concluded, that it was one of our own &s;quadron; but the weather being hazy, no definitive conjecture could be formed concerning her. She again di&s;appeared for &s;ome days, and we were all thrown into the deepe&s;t concern, fearing the weakne&s;s of her condition had di&s;abled her from working to windward, and that all her people had peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>We continued our employ till the 26th, when we again &s;aw the &s;ame &s;hip; and, on her nearer approach, could di&s;tingui&s;h her to be the Glou|ce&s;ter; and, making no doubt of her being in di&s;tre&s;s, the Commodore &s;ent our boat on board her with water and refre&s;hments. We found her in a mi&s;erable condition, not many above 100 people alive, and almo&s;t all tho&s;e helple&s;s with the &s;curvy; their water &s;o very &s;hort, that they were obliged to allow but one pint a day to a man; and the continual flaws off the land, to|gether with their being di&s;abled in their &s;ails and yards, hindered them from getting into the bay. The next day we &s;ent them a fre&s;h &s;upply of fi&s;h, greens, water, and men to help to work the &s;hip; &s;oon after which the flaws drove them off again, and the &s;hip appeared no more till the 30th, when at two in the afternoon &s;he fired a gun, and made a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s. She continued in this manner off and on, &s;ometimes in &s;ight, and &s;ometimes not, till July 23, during which
<PB N="295" REF="306">
time, though we often relieved the people on board with water and other nece&s;&s;aries, yet their &s;ufferings were in&s;upportable, and their whole complement were reduced to about 96 living per&s;ons, all of whom mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in a few days more, had not the wind proved favour|able to bring them into the bay; but providen|tially a fre&s;h gale &s;prung up from the &s;ea, and brought them to an anchor. We immediately &s;ent men on board to a&s;&s;i&s;t in mooring the &s;hip, and continued our con&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tance afterwards, during our &s;tay at this place.</P>
<P>The 5th of Augu&s;t, the Commodore &s;ent the Trial &s;loop to &s;earch the i&s;land of Little Juan Fernandez, le&s;t any of the &s;quadron &s;hould have mi&s;taken that i&s;land for the place of rendezvous, and might remain there in expectation of meet|ing the re&s;t of the fleet.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the Anne pink, which was &s;e|parated from us with the re&s;t of the &s;quadron the 23d of April, appeared in &s;ight. Her arrival gave us new &s;pirits, &s;he being laden principally with provi&s;ions, and we immediately were order|ed full allowance of bread. This &s;hip had been about two months in a &s;afe harbour, on the main land, near the &s;ame parallel with del Soc|coro, where &s;he had been directed by Provi|dence, and where &s;he lay in &s;ecurity, enjoyed plenty, and her people, 16 in number, being once freed from their fears of &s;hipwreck, very &s;oon recovered their wonted vigour, having ex|perienced none of tho&s;e hard&s;hips that were en|dured
<PB N="296" REF="307">
by the re&s;t of the fleet. They told us they had &s;een &s;ome Indians, and one time took one of their canoes with a man, a woman, &s;ome children, a dog, a cat, &amp;c. and &s;ome implements for fi&s;hery; but in a day or two the whole fa|mily, the dog excepted, made their e&s;cape from them in the &s;hip's &s;mall boat, and left them their canoe in her &s;tead. Tho&s;e Indians, they &s;ay, under&s;tood a few Spani&s;h words, and probably might have &s;ome little corre&s;pondence with the &s;outhern Spaniards of Chili, or their nearer bor|dering Indians; or, perhaps, &s;ome of the Fa|thers for propagating the faith may now and then have been among them. The principal refre&s;hments they met with in this port, were wild celery, nettletops, and &s;orrel; cockles and mu&s;cles of an extraordinary &s;ize; good &s;tore of gee&s;e, &s;heep, and penguins. They judged it to lie in lat. 45 deg. 30 min. S. and it may be known by an i&s;land which faces it, and which the inha|bitants call <HI>Inchin,</HI> and by a river in which they found excellent fi&s;h.</P>
<P>This ve&s;&s;el, the Anne pink, was the la&s;t that joined us at Juan Fernandez. The remaining &s;hips of the &s;quadron were the Severn, the Pearl, and the Wager &s;tore-&s;hip. The Severn and Pearl, as has been already ob&s;erved, parted company off Cape Noir, and, as we afterwards learned, put back to the Brazils; &s;o that of all the &s;hips that came into the South Seas, the Wager was the only &s;hip that was mi&s;&s;ing. Captain Cheap, who commanded her, knowing the importance
<PB N="297" REF="308">
of the charge he had in tru&s;t, without which no enterprize on &s;hore could be undertaken, was extremely &s;olicitous to reach Baldivia as the la&s;t place of rendezvous, and the fir&s;t to be attack|ed, before the re&s;t of the &s;quadron &s;hould have fini&s;hed their crui&s;e, that no blame might re&s;t upon him, if the attack of that city &s;hould be judged improper to be carried into execution. But, whil&s;t this brave officer was exerting him&s;elf in endea|vouring to keep clear of the land in making the i&s;land of del Soccoro, he had the misfortune to di&s;locate his &s;houlder, and thereby to di&s;able him&s;elf from pro&s;ecuting with vigour the pur|po&s;e he had in view. The &s;hip being little better than a wreck, the crew in a mi&s;erable de|&s;ponding condition, the officers quite exhau&s;ted, the weather cold and &s;tormy, and the wind and currents bearing in-&s;hore, all the&s;e unlucky cir|cum&s;tances concurring, &s;o entangled the &s;hip with the land, that all the efforts of the feeble crew could not prevent her from running upon a &s;unken rock; where &s;he grounded between two &s;mall i&s;lands, not a mu&s;quet &s;hot from the &s;hore. In this &s;ituation &s;he continued entire till every one on board might have reached the land in &s;afety, and might have &s;tored them&s;elves with provi&s;ions, and every nece&s;&s;ary for their pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and future e&s;cape: but the moment the &s;hip &s;truck, all &s;ubordination cea&s;ed; one part of the crew got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the liquors, intoxicated them&s;elves in a bea&s;tly manner, and grew frantic in their cups; another part began
<PB N="298" REF="309">
to furni&s;h them&s;elves with arms, and to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the money and things of mo&s;t value on board; while the Captain, and &s;ome of the principal officers, endeavoured in vain to maintain their authority, and to pre&s;erve a proper di&s;cipline among them, in order to ef|fect the deliverance of as many as it was po&s;&s;ible from the common danger in which all of them were involved; but the mutinous di&s;po&s;ition that prevailed rendered every effort for their pre&s;ervation ineffectual. Tho&s;e who remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hip and her &s;tores, pointed the cannon, and fired at tho&s;e who had gained the land; tho&s;e at land grew riotous for want of provi&s;ions; nothing but anarchy and confu|&s;ion prevailed; and, what added to the cata&s;|trophe, a mid&s;hipman, named Cozens, who had bu&s;ied him&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to all good govern|ment, was, by the Captain, &s;hot dead upon the &s;pot. This put an end at once to all manner of &s;ub&s;erviency; and after this every one thought him&s;elf at liberty to pur&s;ue what &s;cheme he thought be&s;t for his own pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Of about 130 per&s;ons who reached the &s;hore, 30 died on the place; about 80 others, hav|ing converted the long boat into a &s;chooner, &s;ailed to the &s;outhward, attended by the cutter. The&s;e, being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of provi&s;ions in re-doubling Cape Horn, and having lo&s;t their cutter in a &s;torm, &s;uffered unprecedented hard|&s;hips in their return to the coa&s;t of Brazil, where only 30 of them arrived to give an account of
<PB N="299" REF="310">
the mi&s;erable fate of their companions, &s;everal of whom died of hunger; others de&s;ired to be &s;et on &s;hore; and &s;ome, beginning to be muti|nous, they landed and de&s;erted. Of the 19 who were left behind in Wager-I&s;land with the Captain, 16 embarked on board the barge and the yawl, and attempted to e&s;cape to the north|ward; of the&s;e one was drowned in the yawl, and four were left on a de&s;art part of the coa&s;t, where it is probable they all peri&s;hed; the re|maining 11, after a fruitle&s;s attempt to weather a point of land, called by the Spaniards Cape Tre&s;mentes, were forced to return to Wager I&s;land, from whence they fir&s;t &s;et out, where meeting with a Chiloen Indian, who could &s;peak a little Spani&s;h, they agreed with him to pilot them to Chiloe; but, after coa&s;ting along for four days, the Captain and his officers being on &s;hore, five in number, the other &s;ix per&s;uaded the Indian to put to &s;ea without them, by which the re&s;t were reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of tra|velling near 600 miles, &s;ometimes by land, and &s;ometimes by water, till at length, after a va|riety of misfortunes and hard&s;hips not to be pa|rallelled in romance, four of them, namely, Cap|tain Cheap, the Hon. Mr. Byron, who lately went round the world, Mr. Hamilton, and Mr. Campbell, arrived at Chiloe, where they were received by the Spaniards with great humanity. After &s;ome &s;tay at Chiloe, the Captain and his three officers were &s;ent to Valparai&s;o, and thence to St. Jago, the capital of Chili, where they con|tinued
<PB N="300" REF="311">
above a year; but on advice of a cartel, the Captain, Mr. Byron, and Mr. Hamilton, were permitted to return to Europe; and Mr. Camp|bell, who in the mean time had changed his re|ligion, cho&s;e to embark for Spain; but not meet|ing there with the encouragement he expected, he &s;oon after returned to England, where he publi&s;hed an account of his adventures, but men|tioned not a word of changing his religion, nei|ther does he a&s;&s;ign his rea&s;on for leaving Spain.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that the place where the Wager &s;truck upon the rock, was &s;o near the harbour where the Anne pink found &s;helter during the winter, that the Wager's people were within hearing of the Pink's evening and morn|ing gun, yet never had the thought to follow the &s;ound, or to look out for any &s;traggler from their own &s;quadron.</P>
<P>On the 22d, the Trial arrived from &s;earch|ing the i&s;land of Little Fernandez, and reported that it lies about 20 leagues due we&s;t from this where we lay; that it is about three leagues in compa&s;s, being very mountainous, with &s;ome woods and good runs of water, with multitudes of goats, fi&s;h, &s;ea-lions, and &s;eals, as with us; but no &s;hips were to be &s;een, nor any marks of any having been there.</P>
<P>While we continued at Juan Fernandez, be|&s;ides our nece&s;&s;ary employments, we likewi&s;e began, and pretty far advanced, a wharf for the better landing and embarking &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries
<PB N="301" REF="312">
as we had occa&s;ion for. We kept two ovens employed in baking bread for the &s;hip's com|panies, two &s;mith's forges for repairing old and fitting new iron work, and made abundance or charcoal for future u&s;e. The Commodore likewi&s;e ordered the carpenters to take a care|ful &s;urvey of the Anne Pink, the ma&s;ter of which &s;et forth, that &s;he was in &s;o rotten a condition, as not to be fit to proceed nor return without very con&s;iderable repairs; which repre&s;entation upon a &s;urvey being found to be true, the Com|modore purcha&s;ed her materials at a fair valua|tion, and ordered her to be broke up, and her crew to be put on board the Glouce&s;ter, that &s;hip not having hands enough left to navigate her, much le&s;s to fight her, in ca&s;e of an attack from the enemy.</P>
<P>This i&s;land lies in latitude 33 deg. 40 min. S. and longitude 87 deg 37 min. W. from Lon|don; di&s;tance from the main continent 105 leagues; compa&s;s, by the be&s;t accounts of tho&s;e who had been round it, 12 or 13 leagues. There are two &s;mall and very commodious bays within the points, which form the large one where we lay, one to the ea&s;tward, the other to the we&s;t|ward of us, and no doubt &s;everal others in other parts of the i&s;land; variation, by an ob&s;ervation July 2, in the morning, 8 deg. 4 min. half E. 'Twas reported, that the S. W. end of the i&s;land is much more flat and level than that where we re&s;ided, and the goats more numerous, but wood &s;carcer.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="313">On Tue&s;day, Sept. the 8th, at noon, we &s;aw a &s;ail at &s;ea bearing N. E. by E. and, perceiving, by our gla&s;&s;es that &s;he could be none of our &s;quadron, nor an Engli&s;h-built &s;hip, we fired a gun as a &s;ignal for getting all our people on board; and, having taken &s;everal men out of the Trial, bent our &s;ails, &s;et up our rigging, and &s;lipt our &s;mall bower cable; at &s;ix in the evening we weighed in pur&s;uit of her. In the morning of the next day we got down our &s;tumps, which are generally &s;et up in bad wea|ther in&s;tead of top-gallant ma&s;ts, and in their place get up our top-gallant ma&s;ts and yards, rigged them, and bent their &s;ails. At eleven the &s;ame morning we mu&s;tered and quartered the &s;hip's company. At noon the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez bore W. half S. di&s;tance eight leagues; the two next days we &s;aw nothing of the chace, nor any thing remarkable.</P>
<P>Saturday, Sept. 12, at five in the morning we &s;aw a &s;ail to windward, which bore down to|wards us, and at about two leagues di&s;tance &s;he hawled up the lee clue-garnet of her fore&s;ail, &s;hewed her Spani&s;h colours, and fired a gun, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;ignal concerted be|tween her and others which came out in com|pany with her; but we not an&s;wering nor re|garding it, &s;he hauled clo&s;e on a wind and &s;tood from us, endeavouring to e&s;cape; upon which we gave chace, and it proving &s;ometimes hazy and foggy, we were in danger of lo&s;ing &s;ight of her. About nine in the morning we tacked,
<PB N="303" REF="314">
and at noon coming within gun-&s;hot, we fired five &s;hot at her rigging to bring her to; but &s;he keeping on her cour&s;e, we fired four more, on which &s;he &s;truck her colours, and &s;urrendered without making any oppo&s;ition. This &s;hip hap|pened not to be the &s;ame we went out after. She proved a rich merchant &s;hip, having on board 18,000l. &s;terling in dollars and plate, with &s;ome jewels, and abundance of gold and &s;ilver twi&s;t; but the bulk of her cargo con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ugars and bale goods, mo&s;t of the latter Eu|ropean, but &s;ome the produce of the country. She was called the Nue&s;tra Senora del Monte Carmelo. She was of about 500 tons, was com|manded by Don Manuel Zamorra, and had on board 13 pa&s;&s;engers, mo&s;t of them per&s;ons of fortune, among&s;t whom was the &s;on of the Go|vernor of the city of St. Jago, the capital of Chili. She came from Callao, a port of Lima, the capital of the empire of Peru, bound for Valparai&s;o in Chili, where tho&s;e &s;hips annually trade, exchanging &s;ilver in return for gold and corn, the latter being very &s;carce in Peru, Some of the pri&s;oners informed us, that, if we had taken her in her return from Chili to Peru, we &s;hould have met with as much gold in her as we had now found &s;ilver. She had in the whole a board her 67 per&s;ons, many of them Indians and black &s;laves, who were afterwards very u&s;eful to us in a&s;&s;i&s;ting towards the &s;hip's duty. She had been 27 days from Callao, and
<PB N="304" REF="315">
wanted not above two days &s;ail to compleat her voyage when we took her.</P>
<P>We found in this &s;hip, on &s;earch among the letters from &s;ome merchants in Lima to their friends in Chili, an account of the fate of the Spani&s;h &s;quadron which had been &s;ent after us, viz. that, in attempting to pa&s;s the Cape, they had been forced to put back, after encounter|ing the mo&s;t terrible &s;torms and mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing famine, being reduced to two ounces of bread and half a pint of water each man a day; that, be&s;ides being grievou&s;ly attacked by the &s;curvy, which had made greater havock among them than among us, their &s;hips were almo&s;t en|tirely di&s;abled, their ma&s;ts, &s;ails, yards, rigging and hulls in a manner &s;hattered and torn to pieces; that Admiral Pi&s;arro, and one more of his &s;qua|dron, after having &s;uffered the greate&s;t extremi|ties, had got, with the utmo&s;t difficulty, to Buenos Ayres, on the River Plate; that another of the &s;quadron, a &s;hip of 70 guns, had been entirely lo&s;t near Rio Grande, and that two more had never been heard of; that on their return they had &s;een two large &s;hips pa&s;s by very near them, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be two &s;hips of our &s;quadron, but the weather proving &s;tormy, and the &s;ea running mountains high, they could not interfere with or attack each other. Tho&s;e &s;hips of ours we believed to be the Severn and the Pearl, and hoped they were &s;afely arrived at &s;ome port of the Brazils. Tho&s;e letters came over land from Buenos Ayres to Lima,
<PB N="305" REF="316">
and with them came others containing Admiral Pi&s;arro's advice and in&s;tructions to the Vice|roy of Peru concerning us; wherein he told him, that, though he him&s;elf had been forced back in &s;uch a mi&s;erable condition, not having above 80 or 100 of his men living, and his &s;hips in &s;o ill a &s;tate, that, till &s;ufficient rein|forcements could come to him from Old Spain, he could not po&s;&s;ibly come into tho&s;e &s;eas, yet as the Engli&s;h were a &s;tubborn and re&s;olute peo|ple, and daring enough to per&s;i&s;t ob&s;tinately in the mo&s;t de&s;perate undertakings, he did be|lieve &s;ome of us might po&s;&s;ibly get round; but as he experimentally knew what of nece&s;&s;ity we mu&s;t have &s;uffered in that dreadful pa&s;&s;age, he made no doubt but we &s;hould be in a very weak and defencele&s;s condition; he therefore advi&s;ed the Viceroy to fit out all the &s;trength of &s;hipping he could, and &s;end them to crui&s;e at the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, where we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity touch to refre&s;h our people, and to repair our &s;hips; and farther advi&s;ed, that, in ca&s;e of meet|ing us, they &s;hould not &s;tand to fight or can|nonade at a di&s;tance, in which po&s;&s;ibly we might have the advantage, or make our e&s;cape, but &s;hould board us at once &s;word in hand; which mu&s;t, if well executed, in our weak condition, infallibly prove the means of taking us.</P>
<P>This was a well-laid &s;cheme, and in pur|&s;uance of it the Viceroy equipt three &s;hips at Callao, one of 50, one of 30, and one of 20 guns, all double manned with the choice&s;t men
<PB N="306" REF="317">
they could po&s;&s;ibly procure, and &s;ent them to wait for us accordingly. Tho&s;e &s;hips arrived at Juan Fernandez &s;ome time, I think, in May, and continued till about June the 6th, when, imagining that we mu&s;t be either put back or lo&s;t, they quitted their &s;tation, and &s;ailed for the port of Conception in Chili, and by this means we luckily mi&s;&s;ed them: had it happened other|wi&s;e, as we arrived there with only our &s;ingle &s;hip, in &s;uch a defencele&s;s condition, and had they put their orders in execution with any tolerable degree of re&s;olution, we mu&s;t in all human probability have fallen into their hands.</P>
<P>Our pri&s;oners informed us further, that tho&s;e &s;hips, during their crui&s;e, had met with a &s;torm, in which they had received &s;o much damage, that it mu&s;t be at lea&s;t two months before they could again be fit to go to &s;ea. The whole of his intelligence was as favourable as we could have wi&s;hed; and now we were at no lo&s;s to account for the fre&s;h marks we found at Juan Fernandez, of that i&s;land's having been lately vi&s;ited by &s;ome white people.</P>
<P>Sunday the 13th, having got on board mo&s;t of the pri&s;oners of note, and all the &s;ilver, we made &s;ail for Juan Fernandez; and the weather proving very moderate, at &s;ix in the evening that i&s;land bore N. W. by N. at the di&s;tance of five leagues. At three the next morning we fired three guns, as a &s;ignal to the &s;hips in the bay. At four we anchored, got in our &s;mall
<PB N="307" REF="318">
bower cable, which we had &s;lipped at leaving the place, and moored our &s;hip.</P>
<P>The 15th we employed in watering, and &s;et|ing up our rigging, in order to pur&s;ue our voyage. And this day, the Commodore being informed that &s;everal merchant-&s;hips were now pur&s;uing their trade without fear of any &s;ur|prize, the Trial was ordered out on a crui&s;e, and proceeded immediately.</P>
<P>The 16th we got up a new top-gallant-ma&s;t, and wanting &s;ome cordage we were &s;upplied with it from the Glouce&s;ter. This and the following days, until the 19th, we &s;pent in getting every thing ready for &s;ea with the utmo&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>The 19th we &s;ent 28 of our pri&s;oners on board the Glouce&s;ter, &s;he being weakly manned, and tho&s;e pri&s;oners being good &s;ailors. We likewi&s;e &s;upplied the prize with two months provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, at full allowance, for 20 men; put all the guns belonging to the Anne pink on board of her; and, having left orders with Captain Mitchell, of the Glouce&s;ter, to burn the pink, together with her u&s;ele&s;s &s;tores, and appointed him his &s;tation off the town of Payta, which is the place where the &s;hips be|tween Lima and Panama generally touch to de|liver part of their cargoes to be di&s;per&s;ed through the inland parts of Peru, with orders to &s;ail to that &s;tation as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, we weighed, and took leave of our winter re&s;i|dence, in company with the prize, which the
<PB N="308" REF="319">
Commodore had fitted up to crui&s;e again&s;t the enemy.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t, at four in the evening, we had the la&s;t &s;ight of this i&s;land, it then bearing from us W. by N. at the di&s;tance of 17 leagues. The remaining days, until the 24th, we had variable and uncertain weather, in which we &s;plit our main-top-&s;ail and fore-&s;ail, and received &s;ome other &s;light damage.</P>
<P>The 24th, at five in the evening, being &s;ome|what hazy, we &s;aw two &s;ail to windward, on which we cleared &s;hip, in order to be ready to engage, the large&s;t of the two &s;hips bearing down upon us. At &s;even &s;he came &s;o near, that we haled her in Spani&s;h, and &s;he an&s;wered in Engli&s;h, and told us, that &s;he was a prize taken by the Trial, and that her con&s;ort was the Trial it&s;elf, which was very much di&s;abled. At 11 the next morning, there being a hard gale and high &s;ea, the Trial fired two guns as a &s;ig|nal of di&s;tre&s;s, and bore away before the wind, and we after her. The &s;ame day half an hour pa&s;t noon we &s;poke with the Trial, and found &s;he had &s;prung her main-ma&s;t, and that her main-top-ma&s;t had come by the board: and as we were all of us &s;tanding to the ea&s;tward next morning, with a fre&s;h gale at &s;outh, &s;he had the additional misfortune to &s;pring her fore-ma&s;t; &s;o that now &s;he had not a ma&s;t left. This was a great ob&s;truction; for now we had intelligence by the Trial's prize, that there were many &s;hips at &s;ea richly laden, and that they
<PB N="309" REF="320">
had no apprehen&s;ions of being attacked by us, having received intelligence that our &s;quadron was either put back or de&s;troyed. In the cour&s;e, therefore, of the 48 hours we were de|tained in waiting upon the Trial, I am per|&s;uaded we mi&s;&s;ed the taking many valuable prizes. The re&s;ult was, that a council being called, and all the officers convened together on board our &s;hip, it was there concluded, that in her pre&s;ent condition the Trial could be of no farther &s;ervice; and the Commodore, being re&s;olved to &s;eparate the &s;hips, in order to crui&s;e upon the coa&s;t to the greate&s;t advantage, gave orders to Captain Charles Saunders, the Com|mander, to burn the Trial, and in her room commi&s;&s;ioned the Trial's prize for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, with the &s;ame Commander, officers, and people. This &s;hip, the Trial's prize, was called by the Spaniards the Nue&s;tra Senora de Arin|zazie; but, being now commi&s;&s;ioned for his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ervice, &s;he was henceforth called the Trial's Prize. She was the large&s;t &s;hip we took in tho&s;e &s;eas, being between five and &s;ix hun|dred tons, and loaded with bale goods, &s;ugar, and other commodities, to a con&s;iderable value, and about 5000l. in &s;pecie and wrought &s;ilver.</P>
<P>The 28th, at nine in the morning, we parted with the Trial and both the prizes.</P>
<P>The 30th, we &s;aw the main land of Chili. This day we began to exerci&s;e our people with &s;mall arms, which was the fir&s;t time we had done it &s;ince we came into tho&s;e &s;eas, and which
<PB N="310" REF="321">
we continued at all proper opportunities during the voyage.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of October we came in &s;ight of the high land of Valparai&s;o, bearing N. E. half E. at the di&s;tance of about 14 leagues. This city lies in the latitude of 32 deg. 58 min. S. its longitude from London is by my account 80 deg. 37 min. W.</P>
<P>On the 5th, the Commodore, being informed that there were murmurings among&s;t the peo|ple, becau&s;e the prize-money was not immedi|ately divided, ordered the articles of war to be read; and after that remon&s;trated to them on the danger of mutiny, and &s;aid he had heard the rea&s;on of their di&s;content, but a&s;&s;ured them their properties were &s;ecured by act of parliament as firmly as any one's own inheritance, and that the money, plate, &amp;c. were weighed and marked in public; &s;o that any capable per&s;on, if he plea&s;ed, might take an inventory of the whole. He then read an account of the parti|culars, and told them they might (if they plea&s;ed) make choice of any per&s;on to take an inventory for them, or buy their parts. This &s;pread a vi&s;ible joy, and gave content to every one. We continued crui&s;ing off the coa&s;t of Valparai&s;o till the 8th, when at twelve at night we broke the main top-&s;ail yard in the &s;lings, on which we unbent the top-&s;ail and got down the broken yard. At ten in the morning we &s;aw the high land of Choapa, and over it the Cordillera mountains, being part of that long
<PB N="311" REF="322">
ridge of mountains called the Andes, which run from one end of South America to the o|ther, appearing exce&s;&s;ively high, with their tops covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>The 14th we cro&s;&s;ed the &s;outh Tropic to the northward, and from this time, till we were &s;ome degrees to the northward of the Equator, met with nothing but fair weather and a &s;mooth &s;ea.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t, at noon, the high land of Morro Quemado bore E. by N. at the di&s;tance of four leagues; and here we continued crui&s;ing off and on till Nov. 2, when, about &s;ix in the morning, we &s;aw two &s;ail of &s;hips &s;tanding to|wards us; upon which we made a clear &s;hip, and immediately gave them chace, when we &s;oon perceived that they were the Trial and Centurion prizes. As we had the wind of them, we brought to, and waited their coming up, when Captain Saunders came on board, and ac|quainted the Commodore that he had cleared the Trial pur&s;uant to his orders, and having &s;cuttled her, he remained by her till &s;he &s;unk; but that it was not till the 4th of October be|fore this was effected, by rea&s;on of the great &s;well and hollow &s;ea; that, during his attend|ance on the &s;loop, they were all driven &s;o far to leeward, that they were afterwards obliged to &s;tretch a long way to the we&s;tward, to regain the ground they had lo&s;t; that in their crui&s;e they had met no prize, nor had &s;een any ve&s;&s;el on all the coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="323">Nov. the 3d, at five in the evening, the i&s;land of A&s;ia, in lat. 13 deg. 5 min. S. long. 84 deg. 43 min. W. bore from us N. E. by E. di&s;tance five leagues.</P>
<P>The 5th, at four in the evening, we &s;aw the high land of Barranca, bearing N. E. by E. di&s;tant eight or nine leagues; and half an hour after we &s;aw a &s;ail to the northward, to whom we gave chace, and cleared our &s;hip for engag|ing. At 10 in the evening we came up with her, fired eight guns, and took her. She came from Guaiaquil, and was bound for Callao, with timber, cacao, cordage, tobacco, cacao-nuts, and a &s;mall trunk with bale goods; all of little value to us, though a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s to the Spaniards. She was called the Santa Tere&s;a, commanded by Don Bartolo Urrunaga, with between 30 and 40 people on board, pa&s;&s;engers included, and five or &s;ix women, be&s;ides children. Our Third Lieutenant, two other officers, and a party of &s;ailors, were &s;ent on board to command and take care of her; and our other prizes being far a-&s;tern, occa&s;ioned by our chacing this &s;hip, we lay by till four the next morning, and fired a gun every hour as a &s;ignal for their joining us. This day I find, by the difference of our dead reckoning and ob&s;ervations, a current to &s;et a|long this coa&s;t to the northward of near a mile an hour.</P>
<P>The 7th, we were employed in getting aboard &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores, as planks, cordage, and the like, from our la&s;t prize, for the u&s;e of the
<PB N="313" REF="324">
&s;quadron. The &s;ea here appeared for &s;everal miles of a blood-red colour, which the pri&s;oners informed us was common in tho&s;e parts, and of which mention has been made more than once already in this work. This day we found aboard the prize, in &s;pecie and plate, 50 pounds averdu|pois weight.</P>
<P>The 9th, we brought from on board the Te|re&s;a 10 &s;erons of cacao, one of wax, and 180 fa|thom of three and a half rope.</P>
<P>The 10th, we brought from on board our fir&s;t prize the Carmelo, the following goods, viz. cloth two bales, bays five ditto, &s;ugar 182 loaves, &s;traw mats two, tar one &s;kin, rai&s;ons three bales, indigo four &s;erons, cotton cloth one bale, hats two ca&s;es, and 25 loo&s;e ones, &s;kins one parcel, chocolate one bag, camlet one bale and two parcels, &s;ilks one box, lead four pigs, and combs one &s;mall parcel.</P>
<P>The 12th, at five in the morning, we &s;aw a &s;ail, to which we gave chace; but there being very little wind, we manned and armed our barge, pinnace, and the Trial's pinnace, and &s;ent them to take her, and at eight they boarded and took her, and brought her to us at half an hour pa&s;t 10. She was called the Carmen, com|manded by Signior Marcus Marina, and came out of Payta the day before, bound to Callao, laden with iron and cloth, being a very valuable cargo. We found on board an Iri&s;hman, nam|ed John Williams, who pretended him&s;elf a pri|&s;oner among&s;t them, and with much &s;eeming
<PB N="314" REF="325">
joy entered with us. He informed us, that, a|mong&s;t other &s;hips in the Port of Payta, they left in the road a bark which was taking in 400,000 dollars, with which &s;he would &s;ail for Panama in a day or two at farthe&s;t; and the Spani&s;h pri&s;oners being examined, and confirm|ing the intelligence, and farther giving &s;ome ac|count of the &s;trength of the place, the Commo|dore re&s;olved to attack it this very night, and made preparations accordingly. Mr. Thomas Simmers, mate of our &s;hip, with one mid&s;hip|man and about 10 or 12 men, were &s;ent to com|mand and take cate of this la&s;t prize. At four in the afternoon, Point Nonura bore E. by S. half S. di&s;tant eight leagues. At 10 at night, we &s;ent our barge, pinnace, and Trial's pinnace, to attack the town of Payta, by &s;urprize. They had 49 men well armed, and were commanded by the Lieutenants Brett, Dennis, and Hughes, who had orders, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ecure the Gover|nor of Payta, and &s;end him pri&s;oner on board, in order by that means to procure a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, and a ran&s;om for the town. Half an hour after 11 we &s;ounded, and found 43 fathom water, the ground mud, the i&s;land of Lobos bearing N. N. E. at the di&s;tance of three or four miles. At &s;even in the morning, Point Onado, being the point that forms the bay of Payta, bore S. S. E. two miles di&s;tant; and the town of Payta at the &s;ame time began to open in a direct line with it, di&s;tant about four miles; &s;oon after which we &s;aw our Briti&s;h colours fly|ing
<PB N="315" REF="326">
on the ca&s;tle. At 10, the Trial's boat came on board, loaded with gold and &s;ilver, corn, wrought plate, jewels, and rich moveables. They informed us, that they took the town about two in the morning; and that, though the Spaniards had &s;ome time before been ap|prized of our intent, they yet made a very faint re&s;i&s;tance, having fired but two guns from their ca&s;tle before our men landed, and a few &s;mall arms afterwards, when they all quitted the town with the greate&s;t precipitation. The Governor and his family made their e&s;cape in &s;o much ha&s;te, that his lady was handed out of a window with no other cloaths to cover her but her &s;hift. All the inhabitants fled in the like confu&s;ion, ex|cept &s;ome negro women and children. In this action we lo&s;t one man, Peter Obrian, the Com|modore's &s;teward, who was &s;hot through the brea&s;t by a mu&s;quet ball; and had two wounded, to wit, Arthur Lu&s;k, a quarter-ma&s;ter, and the Spani&s;h pilot of the Tere&s;a, whom we had made u&s;e of as a guide; the fir&s;t through the fle&s;hy part of the arm near the &s;houlder, the &s;econd through the wri&s;t, but neither dangerou&s;ly: and I have had it reported from &s;everal officers then on &s;hore, that our men ran to the attack, and fired in &s;o irregular a manner, that it was, and &s;till remains a doubt, whether tho&s;e were not &s;hot by our people rather than by the enemy.</P>
<P>The town of Payta, at the time of the attack, had a fort with eight guns mounted, which com|manded the town and harbour; and the balcony
<PB N="316" REF="327">
of the Governor's hou&s;e, which again command|ed that fort, together with &s;everal other hou&s;es, was lined with armed men, of which there might be about 400 in the town; but the&s;e people having enjoyed a long peace, and being enervat|ed by the luxury &s;o cu&s;tomary in tho&s;e parts, their arms in a bad condition, and no per&s;on of experience or courage to head them, it is no wonder that they made &s;o &s;mall a re&s;i&s;tance, and were all driven out of the town in le&s;s than half an hour by only 49 men; but I believe the noi&s;e of two drums which we made u&s;e of, together with the &s;uddenne&s;s of the &s;urprize, contributed to intimidate them, and facilitated our &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>On our getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle, our commanding-officer very incon&s;iderately order|ed the guns to be thrown over the walls, which accordingly was executed; but &s;ome time after reflecting on the ill con&s;equence which might attend that proceeding, he ordered two of them to be got up and re mounted.</P>
<P>At 11, our barge came on board, loaded with money, plate, and jewels. This town contains about 140 or 150 hou&s;es; there are in it two churches, which, together with the Governor's hou&s;e and ca&s;tle, are the only remarkable build|ings. There are &s;everal large &s;tore-hou&s;es full of rich European, A&s;ian, and American goods, all which were de&s;troyed when we &s;et the town on fire; of which in its place. The town lies in latitude 5 deg. 3 min. S. and longitude from London 88 deg. 48 min. W. This afternoon
<PB N="317" REF="328">
we employed our&s;elves in getting off the plun|der, and provi&s;ions of hogs and fowls, which were here in great plenty. In the evening we anchored in 10 fathom water, the town bearing from us S. by E. half E. at about three miles di&s;tance, not being able to get farther in, by rea&s;on of the flaws of wind from off the land.</P>
<P>From this time to the 15th we were employed in getting on board the plunder, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of rich brocades, laced cloaths, bales of fine linens and woolens, Britannia's, &s;lays, and the like; together with a great number of hogs, &s;ome &s;heep and fowls, ca&s;es of Spani&s;h brandies and wines, a great quantity of onions, olives, &s;weet-meats, and many other things too tedious to name; all which the &s;ailors hoped would have been equally divided among the &s;hips companies, but they found them&s;elves di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>We found in the road, one &s;hip, two &s;nows, one &s;chooner, and two quarter-gallies, all which we took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. The 14th, in the morn|ing, we &s;aw a bark-log as they call it, being a &s;ort of raft made of the &s;tumps of trees fa&s;tened together, overlaid with poles, and covered with for all twigs twi&s;ted mat wi&s;e, with &s;everal peo|ple in her coming along &s;hore from the &s;outh|ward. She had a &s;ort of ma&s;t and &s;ail in her, and at fir&s;t &s;ight we knew not what to make of her; and none of our own boats being on board, we &s;ent the carmen's boat, with Mr. Langdon, a mid&s;hipman, who commanded in the &s;econd place on board that &s;hip, and &s;ome armed peo|ple,
<PB N="318" REF="329">
to pur&s;ue them, who perceiving it put on &s;hore, and made their e&s;cape over the rocks. Mr. Langdon took their bark-log, which he found to be laden with dried fi&s;h, which we &s;uppo&s;e they were carrying to Payta for a mar|ket. This evening the Spaniards, who had all along appeared in great numbers from the hills, and were now con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, making a &s;hew of warlike preparations, as if they de&s;igned in the night to attack our people in the town, they thereupon barricaded the &s;treets, and kept very &s;trict watches, to prevent a &s;ur|prize. Several negroes delivered them&s;elves up, de&s;iring to be made pri&s;oners, that they might have &s;ome food, and more e&s;pecially water, to keep them from peri&s;hing; for the country thereabouts being for many miles round quite barren and &s;andy, without either water or any other thing nece&s;&s;ary for life, and the neare&s;t town to them, named as I think Sancta Cruz, whence relief might be got, being a day and a half or two days journey off, the people who had left the town were in a &s;tarving condition, and we had melancholy accounts of &s;everal dy|ing among them for want chiefly of water dur|ing our &s;mall &s;tay; and yet &s;o greatly were they infatuated or frightened, that they never offered to treat for the ran&s;om of the place, which if they had done, I believe it would not have been de|&s;troyed; in which ca&s;e they might have &s;ecur|ed to them&s;elves not only their habitations, but provi&s;ions and water enough (till they could
<PB N="319" REF="330">
have got a fre&s;h recruit), which we &s;hould on that condition have readily left them.</P>
<P>The town &s;eems to be very unhappily &s;ituat|ed on that and &s;ome other accounts, they hav|ing no water but what is brought them by land-carriage from &s;everal leagues off; &s;o that they are obliged to keep very con&s;iderable quantities by them in earthen jars, not only for their own u&s;e, but for the &s;hips who frequently touch here, where they likewi&s;e often unload, and take in fre&s;h cargoes. They are in the &s;ame ca&s;e as to grain, bread, and almo&s;t all other nece&s;&s;aries of life; and lie &s;o open to an enemy, that the town has been often taken and ruined by the Engli&s;h, Dutch, and French; all which inconveniencies, one would imagine, &s;hould tempt them to change their &s;ituation: but then the conveniency of their trade is &s;o great, being the only proper place they can pitch on for a mart between Panama and Peru, that they prefer this lucrative conve|nience to all other con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Among the &s;laves who had de&s;ired to be en|tertained in our &s;ervice, was one, who, having been a &s;lave in Jamaica, had on the death of his ma&s;ter obtained his liberty, and thereupon en|tered him&s;elf a &s;ervant to one of the South-Sea Company's factors, whom he accompanied to Porto Bello and Panama, and there got into the &s;ervice of a Spani&s;h gentleman, who took a great fancy to him, and with whom he went to Lima in Peru, where this ma&s;ter likewi&s;e dying left him a very con&s;iderable legacy; but the power
<PB N="320" REF="331">
being now in the hands of his executors, they not only defrauded him of this legacy, but made him a &s;lave a &s;econd time. He was now at Payta with one of his new ma&s;ters, on his pa&s;|&s;age from Lima to Panama, when he took this opportunity to come over to us; and being a very handy fellow, and accu&s;tomed to wait on gentlemen, he was immediately taken into the Commodore's &s;ervice, came with us into Eng|land, and, I believe, continued with him till his death. This per&s;on gave us &s;ome information of the de&s;igns of the Spaniards on &s;hore, and told us we had killed one or two of them, and wounded &s;everal others; but this account was never, that I know of, farther confirmed.</P>
<P>The 15th, in the morning, we &s;ent on &s;hore all our Spani&s;h, and &s;everal of our Indian pri|&s;oners, keeping all the blacks and &s;ome of the Indians, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in working the &s;hips, &amp;c. To the blacks, who were all or mo&s;t of them &s;laves, was promi&s;ed their liberty in England, in ca&s;e they would &s;tand by and a&s;&s;i&s;t us again&s;t our enemies the Spaniards; which they all promi&s;|ed very cordially: but we could &s;oon di&s;cover, that, notwith&s;tanding their &s;eeming conde&s;cen|&s;ion, mo&s;t of them would have much rather con|tinued in the &s;ervice of their old ma&s;ters, than fail to accept of liberty with us; not that I be|lieve tho&s;e people were in love with &s;lavery, or would not willingly have had their liberty, but then it mu&s;t be on their own terms, the Spa|niards in tho&s;e parts being in great awe of the
<PB N="311" REF="332">
Indians, whom, though they have &s;ubdued, and &s;eem to have incorporated among them, they dare not tru&s;t, but keep the&s;e blacks as guards, and u&s;e them well. The truth is, tho&s;e Indians have &s;till pre&s;erved, by tradition from father to &s;on, the memory of the great cruelties which the fir&s;t Spaniards exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e parts, and are angry enough at their pre&s;ent hard u&s;age. They look on them&s;elves as the natural lords of the coun|try, and the Spaniards as covetous intruders, and cruel inhuman tyrants; and want only op|portunity to make them &s;en&s;ible of their re&s;ent|ment, and to recover their lo&s;t country and li|berty. 'Tis on this account that the Spaniards are very kind to their black &s;laves, whom they cheri&s;h and encourage highly, and look on them in the &s;ame light of a &s;tanding militia, always ready to arm again&s;t tho&s;e Indians; &s;o that, though the negroes in all other plantations in the We&s;t Indies are ever ready for revolts and rebellions, the&s;e, on the contrary, are always rea|dy to defend their kind ma&s;ters with their lives. In effect they live very ea&s;y, are favoured by the Spaniards, and &s;corn and in&s;ult the poor In|dians, who in return hate and dete&s;t both them and their ma&s;ters; that being all that is left in their power.</P>
<P>This day an order was given to Mr. Brett, the then commanding officer on &s;hore, to burn and de&s;troy the town entirely, the two churches, which &s;tood a little out of the way of the re&s;t, only excepted; the Spaniards, as has been al|ready
<PB N="322" REF="333">
&s;aid, never having made any advance to|wards treating for its ran&s;om.</P>
<P>But now, before I entirely quit the relation of our tran&s;actions at this place, it may, perhaps, be expected, that I &s;hould give a more particular account of the booty we made, and of the lo&s;s the Spaniards &s;u&s;tained. I have already ob&s;erv|ed, that there were great quantities of valuable effects in the town; but, as mo&s;t of them were what we could neither di&s;po&s;e of, nor carry away, the total of this merchandize can only be rudely gue&s;&s;ed at. The Spaniards, in their repre&s;enta|tions &s;ent to the court of Madrid (as we were afterwards a&s;&s;ured), e&s;timated their whole lo&s;s at a million and a half of dollars; and when it is con&s;idered, that no &s;mall part of the goods we left behind us, were of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t ex|pen&s;ive &s;pecies, as broad-cloths, &s;ilks, cambrics, velvets, &amp;c. I cannot but think their valuation &s;ufficiently moderate.</P>
<P>As to our&s;elves, the acqui&s;ition we made, though incon&s;iderable in compari&s;on of what we de&s;troyed, was yet far from de&s;picable; for the wrought plate, dollars, and other coin, which fell into our hands, amounted to upwards of 30,000 l. be&s;ides &s;everal rings, bracelets, and jewels, who&s;e intrin&s;ic value we could not then e&s;timate: and over and above all this, the plun|der, which became the property of the immediate captors, was very great; &s;o that, upon the whole, it was by much the mo&s;t important booty we met with upon that coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="334">There remains &s;till another matter to be re|lated, which on account of the &s;ignal honour which our national character in tho&s;e parts has thence received, and the reputation which our Commodore in particular has thereby acquired, merits a di&s;tinct and circum&s;tantial di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I have already ob&s;erved, that all the pri&s;oners taken by us were, before our departure, put on &s;hore, and di&s;charged, among&s;t whom there were &s;ome per&s;ons of con&s;iderable di&s;tinction, e&s;pecially a youth of about 17 years of age, &s;on of the Vice-Pre&s;ident of the Council of Chili. As the barbarity of the buccaneers, and the art|ful u&s;es the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had made of it, had filled the natives of tho&s;e countries with the mo&s;t ter|rible ideas of Engli&s;h cruelty, we always found our pri&s;oners, at their fir&s;t coming on board us, to be extremely dejected, and under great hor|ror and anxiety; particularly this youth, who, having never been from home before, lamented his captivity in the mo&s;t moving manner, regret|ting, in very plaintive terms, his parents, his bro|thers, his &s;i&s;ters, and his native country; of all which, he was fully per&s;uaded, he had taken his la&s;t farewel, believing that he was now devoted for the remaining part of his life to an abject and cruel &s;ervitude. Indeed, his companions on board, and all the Spaniards that came into our power, had the &s;ame de&s;ponding opinion of their &s;ituation. Mr. An&s;on con&s;tantly exerted his ut|mo&s;t endeavours to efface tho&s;e terrifying im|pre&s;&s;ions they had received of us, always taking
<PB N="324" REF="335">
care, that as many of the principal people among them as there was room for &s;hould dine at his table by turns; and giving the mo&s;t peremp|tory orders, too, that they &s;hould always be treat|ed with the utmo&s;t decency and humanity: but, notwith&s;tanding this precaution, it was generally ob&s;erved, that for the fir&s;t day or two they did not quit their fears, &s;u&s;pecting the gentlene&s;s of their u&s;age to be only preparatory to &s;ome un|thought of calamity. However, being at length convinced of our &s;incerity, they grew perfectly ea&s;y in their &s;ituation, and remarkably chearful; &s;o that it was often di&s;putable, whether or no they con&s;idered their being detained by us as a misfortune: for the youth I have above men|tioned, who was near two months on board us, had at la&s;t &s;o far conquered his melancholy &s;ur|mi&s;es, and had taken &s;uch an affection to Mr. An&s;on, that it is doubtful to me, whether, if his own opinion had been a&s;ked, he would not have preferred a voyage to England in the Centurion, to the being &s;et on &s;hore at Payta, where he was at liberty to return to his country and friends.</P>
<P>This conduct of the Commodore to his pri|&s;oners, which was continued without interruption or deviation, gave them all the highe&s;t idea of his humanity and benevolence, and occa&s;ioned them, likewi&s;e, (as mankind are fond of form|ing general opinions) to entertain very favour|able thoughts of the whole Engli&s;h nation. But whatever they might be di&s;po&s;ed to think of Mr. An&s;on before the capture of the Tere&s;a,

their veneration for him was prodigiou&s;ly in|crea&s;ed by his conduct towards the ladies whom he took in that ve&s;&s;el; for, being informed that there were among them a mother and two daughters of exqui&s;ite beauty, who were of quality, he not only gave orders that they &s;hould be left in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own apartments, but al&s;o forbid, on the &s;evere&s;t pe|nalties, any of the common people on board from approaching them; and, that they might be the more certain of having the&s;e orders com|plied with, or of having the means of com|plaining if they were not, he permitted the pilot, who in Spani&s;h &s;hips is generally the &s;e|cond per&s;on on board, to &s;tay with them as a guardian and protector. The&s;e were mea&s;ures that &s;eemed &s;o different from what might have been expected from an enemy and an heretic, that the Spaniards on board, though they had them&s;elves experienced his beneficence, were &s;ur|prized at this new in&s;tance of it; and the more &s;o, as all this was done without &s;olicitation, and without the interpo&s;ition of one friend to inter|cede in their favour. The ladies were &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of the obligations they owed him for the care and atention with which he protected them, that they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go to &s;hore at Payta, till they had been permitted to wait on him on board the Centurion to return him thanks in per&s;on. Indeed, all the pri&s;oners left us with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of their grateful remembrance of his uncommon treat|ment:
<PB N="326" REF="337">
a je&s;uit, in particular, whom the Com|modore had taken, and who was an eccle&s;ia&s;tic of &s;ome di&s;tinction, could not help expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with great thankfulne&s;s for the civili|ties he and his countrymen had found on board, declaring that he &s;hould con&s;ider it as his duty to do Mr. An&s;on ju&s;tice at all times, adding that his u&s;age of the men pri&s;oners was &s;uch as could never be forgotten, and &s;uch as he &s;hould never fail to acknowledge upon all occa&s;ions; but that his behaviour to the ladies was &s;o ex|traordinary, and &s;o extremely honourable, that he doubted if all the regard due to his own eccle&s;ia&s;tical character would be &s;ufficient to render it credible. Indeed, we were afterwards informed, that he and the re&s;t of our pri&s;oners had not been &s;ilent on this head; but that, both at Lima and at other places, they had given the greate&s;t encomiums to our Commodore; that the je&s;uit, in particular, as we were told, on his account, interpreted in a lax and hypothetical &s;en&s;e, that article of his church which a&s;&s;erts the impo&s;&s;ibility of heretics being &s;aved&mdash;But to return:</P>
<P>After we had fini&s;hed our bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;et the town in flames, and got the trea&s;ure on board, Mr. Brett, the officer who commanded the attack, having collected his men together, was directing his march towards the beach where the boats waited to take them on board, when the Spaniards on the hill behind the town, ob&s;erving his retreat, re&s;olved to try if
<PB N="327" REF="338">
they could not precipitate his departure, and thereby lay &s;ome foundation for future boa&s;ting. To this end a party of hor&s;e, all picked men &s;ingled out for this daring enterprize, marched down the hill with much &s;eeming re&s;olution; &s;o that, had we not entertained a ju&s;t opinion of their prowe&s;s, we might have imagined, that, now we were upon the open beach, with no advantages of &s;ituation, they would certainly have charged us: but we pre&s;umed, and we were not mi&s;taken, that all this was mere o&s;ten|tation; for, notwith&s;tanding the pomp and pa|rade they at fir&s;t came on with, Mr. Brett had no &s;ooner ordered his men to halt and face a|bout, than the enemy &s;topt their career, and never dared to advance a &s;tep farther.</P>
<P>When our people arrived at their boats and were ready to go on board, they were for &s;ome time retarded by mi&s;&s;ing one of their number; and being unable, on their mutual enquiries a|mong each other, to inform them&s;elves where he was left, or by what accident detained, they, after a con&s;iderable delay, re&s;olved to get into their boats and to depart without him: but, when the la&s;t man was actually embarked, and the boats were ju&s;t putting off, they heard him calling to them to take him in. The place was by this time &s;o thoroughly on fire, and the &s;moke covered the beach &s;o effectually, that they could &s;carcely di&s;cern him, though they heard his voice. However, the Lieutenant in|&s;tantly ordered one of the boats to his relief,
<PB N="328" REF="339">
who found him up to the chin in water, for he had waded as far as he dur&s;t, being extremely frightened with the apprehen&s;ions of falling into the hands of an enemy, enraged, as they doubt|le&s;s were, at the pillage and de&s;truction of their town. On enquiring into the cau&s;e of his &s;tay|ing behind, it was found that he had taken that morning too large a do&s;e of brandy, which had thrown him into &s;o &s;ound a &s;leep, that he did not awake till the fire came near enough to &s;corch him. He was &s;trangely amazed, at fir&s;t opening his eyes, to &s;ee the hou&s;es on a blaze on one &s;ide, and &s;everal Spaniards and Indians not far from him on the other. The greatne&s;s and &s;uddenne&s;s of his fright in&s;tantly reduced him into a &s;tate of &s;obriety, and gave him &s;ufficient pre&s;ence of mind to pu&s;h through the thicke&s;t of the &s;moke, as the likelie&s;t means to e&s;cape the enemy; and, making the be&s;t of his way to the beach, he ran as far into the water as he dur&s;t (for he could not &s;wim), before he ventured to look back.</P>
<P>By the time our people had helped their com|rade out of the water, and were making the be&s;t of their way to the &s;quadron, the flames had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every part of the town, and burnt &s;o furiou&s;ly, both by means of the combu&s;|tibles that had been di&s;tributed for that purpo&s;e, and by the &s;lightne&s;s of the materials of which the hou&s;es were compo&s;ed, and their aptitude to take fire, that it was &s;ufficiently apparent no ef|forts of the enemy (though they flocked down
<PB N="329" REF="340">
in great numbers) could po&s;&s;ibly put a &s;top to it, or prevent the entire de&s;truction of the place, and all the merchandize contained therein. Mr. Brett had the curio&s;ity to delineate its appear|ance, together with that of the &s;hips in the har|bour, as may be &s;een in the Plate.</P>
<P>Our detachment having now &s;afely joined the &s;quadron, the Commodore prepared to leave the place the &s;ame evening. At &s;even, Cape Blanco, in lat. 4 deg. 28 min. S. and long. 88 deg. 16 min. W. from London, bore from us S. S. E. half E. about &s;even or eight miles di&s;tant. This afternoon and the next day we were employed in taking the mo&s;t u&s;eful and valuable things out of the Santa Tere&s;a and the Payta bark: we likewi&s;e de&s;igning to take every nece&s;&s;ary thing which we conveniently could out of the Santa Tere&s;a, in order to de&s;troy her, and bring our &s;trength into a le&s;s compa&s;s, we took her in tow, and &s;et the Payta bark on fire with the &s;ame view. The next day we de&s;troyed the Santa Tere&s;a in the &s;ame manner, having got out of them both &s;ome anchors, cables, haw&s;ers, yards, and top-ma&s;ts, blocks, bales of goods, and &s;everal other nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>The 17th at three in the afternoon, the Glou|ce&s;ter, with a prize of her's in tow, joined us. This prize was called the Del Oro, and was chiefly laden with wine; however, out of her and a &s;mall boat which they took going along &s;hore, they got, in gold, &s;ilver, and wrought plate, to about the value of 17 or 18000 l.
<PB N="330" REF="341">
The&s;e two were all the prizes the Glouce&s;ter took in tho&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>On board this prize of this Glouce&s;ter were two hor&s;es, which being, I &s;uppo&s;e, fat, and probably better food than their &s;alt beef or pork, they killed and eat them; and this, I imagine, gave ground to that fiction which one of the &s;purious accounts of our voyage has giv|en, of our eagerly hunting and eating wild hor&s;es, whereas in reality we never &s;aw nor heard of a wild hor&s;e during the voyage.</P>
<P>The Glouce&s;ter had chaced two or three &s;hips which had e&s;caped her, and one of tho&s;e touch|ed at Payta; and though they could give no certain account that the &s;hip which had chaced them was an enemy, yet the circum&s;tances they gave were &s;o &s;trong, that it put the people of Payta upon &s;ecuring their trea&s;ure, and the be&s;t of their effects, not caring to be too well provid|ed for the profit of &s;uch unwelcome vi&s;itants.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t, at half pa&s;t five in the morning, we &s;aw the i&s;land of Plata, &s;o called from Sir Francis Drake's having, as it is &s;aid, divided the trea&s;ure he took in the South Seas at this place. At two this afternoon, the port of Manta bore S. E. by E. di&s;tant about eight or nine leagues. We at this time &s;ent &s;ix months provi&s;ions on board the Carmen; and all the &s;hips had orders, in ca&s;e of &s;eparation, for &s;everal rendezvou&s;es on the coa&s;t of Mexico, or, in ca&s;e of not meeting there, to make the be&s;t of their way to Macao,
<PB N="331" REF="342">
in China, where they were to await the arrival of the Commodore.</P>
<P>The 22d, a divi&s;ion was made of the plunder of Payta, and the Commodore not appearing in that affair, it was done at the plea&s;ure, and to the entire &s;atisfaction, of five or &s;ix (no doubt) very di&s;intere&s;ted officers; and, indeed, mo&s;t things of this nature, during the cour&s;e of the voyage being managed with the &s;ame di&s;cretion and honour, no room was left for complaining of particular partialities.</P>
<P>Here, however, we cannot help remarking a very con&s;iderable difference between the relation given by Pa&s;coe Thomas, and that given by Mr. Walters; the former having a&s;&s;erted, that the Commodore did <HI>not</HI> interfere in the di&s;tribution; the latter, that it was by his prudent manage|ment, that a jealou&s;y, which had ari&s;en between tho&s;e who were the real captors, and tho&s;e who remained on board the &s;hip, was accommodated. Mr. Walters' account will &s;et this matter in a true light: <Q REND="inline">"And now, &s;ays he, (while the &s;hips lay-to, in hopes of joining the Glouce&s;ter,) a jea|lou&s;y, which had taken its ri&s;e at Payta, between tho&s;e who had been commanded on &s;hore for the attack, and tho&s;e who had continued on board, grew to &s;uch a height, that the Commodore, be|ing made acquainted with it, thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to interpo&s;e his authority to oppo&s;e it. The ground of this animo&s;ity was the plunder gotten at Payta, which tho&s;e who had acted on &s;hore had appropriated to them&s;elves, con&s;idering it
<PB N="332" REF="343">
as a reward for the ri&s;ques they had run, and the re&s;olution they had &s;hewn in that &s;ervice. But tho&s;e who had remained on board looked on this as a very partial and unju&s;t procedure, urging, that, had it been left to their choice, they &s;hould have preferred the acting on &s;hore to the continuing on board; that their duty while their comrades were on &s;hore was ex|tremely fatiguing; for, be&s;ides the labour of the day, they were con&s;tantly under arms all night, to &s;ecure the pri&s;oners, who&s;e numbers exceeded their own, and of whom it was then nece&s;&s;ary to be extremely watchful, to prevent any at|tempts they might have formed in that critical conjuncture: that, upon the whole, it could not be denied, but that the pre&s;ence of a &s;ufficient force on board was as nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize, as the action of the others on &s;hore; and, therefore, tho&s;e who had continued on board maintained, that they could not be de|prived of their &s;hare of the plunder without ma|nife&s;t inju&s;tice. The&s;e were the conte&s;ts among&s;t our men, which were carried on with great heat on both &s;ides; and, though the plunder in que&s;|tion was a very trifle in compari&s;on of the trea|&s;ure taken in the place (in which there was no doubt but tho&s;e on board had an equal right), yet as the ob&s;tinacy of &s;ailors is not always regu|lated by the importance of the matter in di&s;|pute, the Commodore thought it nece&s;&s;ary to put a &s;top to this ferment betimes. According|ly, the morning after our leaving Payta, he or|dered
<PB N="333" REF="344">
all hands upon the quarter-deck, where addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to tho&s;e who had been de|tached on &s;hore, he commended their behaviour, and thanked them for their &s;ervices on that oc|ca&s;ion; but then, repre&s;enting to them the rea|&s;ons urged by tho&s;e who had continued on board, for an equal di&s;tribution of the plunder, he told them, that he thought the&s;e rea&s;ons very con|clu&s;ive, and that the expectations of their com|rades were ju&s;tly founded; and therefore, he in|&s;i&s;ted, that, not only the men, but all the officers likewi&s;e who had been employed in taking the place, &s;hould produce the whole of their plun|der immediately upon the quarter-deck, and that it &s;hould be impartially divided among&s;t the whole crew, in proportion to each man's rank and commi&s;&s;ion; and, to prevent tho&s;e who had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the plunder from murmur|ing at this diminution of their &s;hare, the Com|modore added, that, as an encouragement to others who might be hereafter employed on like &s;ervices, he would give his entire &s;hare to be di&s;tributed among&s;t tho&s;e who had been detach|ed for the attack of the place. Thus, this trouble&s;ome affair, which, if permitted to have gone on, might, perhaps, have been attended with mi&s;chievous con&s;equences, was, by the Commodore's prudence, &s;oon appea&s;ed, to the general &s;atisfaction of the &s;hip's company: not but there were &s;ome few who&s;e &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;i|tions were uninfluenced by the ju&s;tice of this procedure, and who were incapable of di&s;cern|ing
<PB N="334" REF="345">
the force of equity, however glaring, when is tended to deprive them of any part of what they had once got into their hands."</Q></P>
<P>Being now joined by the Glouce&s;ter and her prize, it was re&s;olved that we &s;hould &s;tand to the northward, and make the be&s;t of our way either to Cape St. Lucas on California, or to Cape Corientes on the coa&s;t of Mexico. In|deed, the Commodore, when at Juan Fernan|dez, had determined to touch in the neigh|bourhood of Panama, and to endeavour to get &s;ome corre&s;pondence over land with the fleet under the command of Admiral Vernon; for when we departed from England, we left a large force at Port&s;mouth, which was intended to be &s;ent to the We&s;t Indies, there to be em|ployed in an expedition again&s;t &s;ome of the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements. And Mr. An&s;on, taking it for granted that this enterprize had &s;ucceed|ed, and that Porto Bello perhaps might be then garri&s;oned by Briti&s;h troops, he hoped that, on his arrival at the i&s;thmus, he &s;hould ea&s;ily pro|cure an intercour&s;e with our countrymen on the other &s;ide, either by the Indians, who were greatly di&s;po&s;ed in our favour, or even by the Spaniards them&s;elves, &s;ome of whom for pro|per rewards might be induced to carry on this intelligence; which, after it was once begun, might be continued with very little difficulty; &s;o that Mr. An&s;on flattered him&s;elf, that he might by this means have received a reinforce|ment of men from the other &s;ide, and that, by
<PB N="335" REF="346">
&s;ettling a prudent plan of operations with our Commanders in the We&s;t Indies, he might have taken even Panama it&s;elf, which would have given to the Briti&s;h nation the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that i&s;thmus, whereby we &s;hould have been in ef|fect ma&s;ters of all the trea&s;ures of Peru.</P>
<P>Such were the projects which the Commo|dore revolved in his thoughts, at the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez, notwith&s;tanding the feeble condition to which he was then reduced; but in examining the papers which were found on board the Carmelo, the fir&s;t prize we took, we learned, that our attempt again&s;t Carthagena had failed, and that there was no probability that our fleet in that part of the world would engage in any new enterprize that would at all facilitate this plan. Mr. An&s;on therefore gave over all hopes of being reinforced acro&s;s the i&s;thmus, and con&s;equently had no inducement at pre&s;ent to proceed to Panama, as he was in|capable of attacking the place, and there was great rea&s;on to believe that, by this time, there was a general embargo on all the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The only fea&s;ible mea&s;ure, then, which was left us, was to &s;teer as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to the &s;outhern parts of California, or to the adjacent coa&s;t of Mexico, there to crui&s;e for the Manilla galleon, which we knew was now at &s;ea, bound to the port of Acapulco; and we doubted not but to get on that &s;tation time enough to inter|cept her: but there was a bu&s;ine&s;s which we fore|&s;aw would occa&s;ion &s;ome delay, and that was the
<PB N="336" REF="347">
recruiting our water, it being impo&s;&s;ible to think of venturing upon this pa&s;&s;age to the coa&s;t of Mexico till we had procured a fre&s;h &s;upply. It was for &s;ome time a matter of de|liberation, where we &s;hould take in this nece&s;|&s;ary article; but, by con&s;ulting the accounts of former navigators, and examining our pri&s;on|ers, we at la&s;t re&s;olved for the i&s;land of Quibo, &s;ituated at the mouth of the bay of Panama. Nor was it but on good grounds that the Commodore conceived this to be the propere&s;t place for wa|tering the &s;quadron. Indeed, there was a &s;mall i&s;land called Cocos, which was le&s;s out of our way than Quibo, where &s;ome of the buccaneers had pretended to find water; but none of our pri&s;oners knew any thing of it, and it was thought 100 dangerous to ri&s;que the &s;afety of the &s;quadron, by expo&s;ing our&s;elves to the hazard of not meeting with water when we came there, on the mere authority of tho&s;e legendary writers, of who&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations and fal&s;ities we had almo&s;t daily experience. Determined, there|fore, to take in water at Quibo, we directed our cour&s;e northward, being eight &s;ail in com|pany, and con&s;equently having the appearance of a very formidable fleet; and on the 19th, at day-break, we di&s;covered Cape Blanco, bearing S. S. E. half E. &s;even miles di&s;tant. By this time we found that our la&s;t prize, the Solidad, was far from an&s;wering the character given of her as a good &s;ailor; and &s;he and the Santa Te|re&s;a delaying us con&s;iderably, the Commodore
<PB N="337" REF="348">
commanded them to be cleared of every thing that might prove u&s;eful to the re&s;t of the &s;hips, and then to be burnt. And having given proper in&s;tructions, and appointed a rendezvous to the Glouce&s;ter, and to the prizes, in ca&s;e of &s;epara|tion, we proceeded in our cour&s;e for Quibo.</P>
<P>On the 25th, Point Manta bore S. E. by E. at &s;even miles di&s;tance, and there being a town of the &s;ame name in the neighbourhood, Cap|tain Mitchell in the Glouce&s;ter took the oppor|tunity of &s;etting on &s;hore &s;everal of his pri&s;oners. The boats were now daily employed in di&s;tri|buting provi&s;ions on board the prizes, to com|pleat their &s;tock for &s;ix months; and that the Centurion might be the better prepared to give the Manilla &s;hip a warm reception, if happily &s;he &s;hould fall in our way, the carpenters were ordered to fix eight &s;tocks on the main and fore tops, which were properly fitted for the mounting of &s;wivel guns.</P>
<P>On the 25th we had &s;ight of the i&s;land of Gallo; and from hence we cro&s;&s;ed the bay of Panama, &s;haping our cour&s;e in a direct line for Quibo. Here we found, in a few days, a very con&s;iderable alteration in the climate; for, in|&s;tead of that uniform temperature, where neither the exce&s;s of heat or cold was prevalent, we had now clo&s;e and &s;ultry weather, like that we met with on the coa&s;t of Brazil. We had, be&s;ides, frequent calms and heavy rains, which we at fir&s;t a&s;cribed to the neighbourhood of the Line,
<PB N="338" REF="349">
where this kind of weather is ob&s;erved to obtain at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year; but, finding that it attended us for more than &s;even degrees of north latitude, we began to &s;u&s;pect that the &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on, or, as the Spaniards call it, the Vandewals, was not yet pa&s;t; though many writers, particularly Captain Shelvock, a&s;&s;ert, that this &s;ea&s;on begins in June, and ends in November: but, perhaps, its end may not be always regular.</P>
<P>On the 27th, Capt. Mitchell having cleared his large&s;t prize, &s;he was likewi&s;e &s;et on fire; and now our fleet con&s;i&s;ted only of five &s;hips, and we were fortunate enough to find them all good &s;ailors. On the 3d of December we had a view of the i&s;land of Quibo, the ea&s;t end of which bore from us N. N. W. four leagues di&s;|tant, and the i&s;land of Quicara W. N. W. at about the &s;ame di&s;tance. When we had thus got &s;ight of land, we found the wind to hang we&s;terly; and therefore night coming on, we thought it advi&s;eable to &s;tand off till morning, as there are &s;aid to be &s;ome &s;hoals at the en|trance of the channel. At &s;ix the next morn|ing, Point Marrato bore N. E. half N. three or four leagues di&s;tant. In weathering this point, all the &s;quadron, except the Centurion, were very near it; and the Glouce&s;ter, being the leeward-mo&s;t &s;hip, was forced to tack and &s;tand to the &s;outhward; &s;o that we lo&s;t &s;ight of her; and, the wind proving unfavourable, we &s;aw her no more till we quitted the i&s;land. At
<PB N="339" REF="350">
&s;even in the evening we anchored in the Canal Bueno, or Good Channel, which is at lea&s;t &s;ix miles in breadth, muddy ground. Next morn|ing an officer was di&s;patched on &s;hore to di&s;|cover the watering-place, who, having found it, returned before noon; and then we &s;ent our long-boat for a load of water, and at the &s;ame time weighed and &s;tood further in with our &s;hips, for the convenience of being &s;ooner &s;up|plied; &s;o that we were little more than two days in laying in all the wood and water we wanted. Whil&s;t the &s;hip continued here at anchor, the Commodore, attended by &s;ome of his officers, went in a boat to examine a bay which lay to the northward, and they afterwards ranged all along the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;land. In the places where they put on &s;hore, in the cour&s;e of this expedition, they generally found the &s;oil to be rich, and met with great plenty of excellent water. In particular, near the north|ea&s;t point of the i&s;land, they di&s;covered a natu|ral ca&s;cade, which &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, as they conceived, every thing of this kind which human art had ever yet produced. It was a river of tran&s;|parent water, about 40 yards wide, which rolled down a declivity of near 150 feet in length. The channel it&s;elf was very irregular, intirely compo&s;ed of rocks, both its &s;ides and bottom being made up of large detached blocks, and by the&s;e the cour&s;e of the water was frequently interrupted; for in &s;ome parts it ran &s;loping with a rapid but uniform motion, whil&s;t in
<PB N="340" REF="351">
others it tumbled over ledges of rocks with a perpendicular de&s;cent. On the neighbourhood of this &s;tream was a fine wood; and even the huge ma&s;&s;es of rock which over-hung the wa|ter, and which by their various projections formed the inequalities of the channel, were covered with lofty fore&s;t trees. Whil&s;t the Commodore, with tho&s;e who accompanied him, were attentively viewing this place, and were remarking the different blendings of the water, the rocks, and the wood, there came in &s;ight, as it were to heighten and animate the pro&s;pect, a prodigious flight of Mackaws, which, hover|ing over this &s;pot, and often wheeling and playing on the wing above it, afforded a mo&s;t brilliant appearance, by the glittering of the &s;un, and their variegated plumage; &s;o that &s;ome of the &s;pectators cannot refrain from a kind of tran&s;port when they recount the beauties which occurred in this extraordinary waterfal.</P>
<P>In three days we compleated our bu&s;ine&s;s in this place, and were impatient to depart, that we might arrive time enough on the coa&s;t of Mexi|co, to intercept the galleon; but the wind, be|ing contrary, detained us a night; and next day, when we had gained an offing, while we were hovering about in hopes of getting &s;ight of the Glouce&s;ter, we on the 20th di&s;cerned a &s;mall &s;ail to the northward of us, to which we gave chace, and coming up with her took her. She proved to be a bark from Panama, called the Je&s;u Nazareno, laden with oakum, rock &s;alt,

and a &s;mall quantity of money to purcha&s;e a car|go of provi&s;ions at Cheripe, an incon&s;iderable village on the continent, which, however, has a good market, from whence future voyagers, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, may be plentifully &s;upplied.</P>
<P>On the 12th of September we joined the Glouce&s;ter, who informed us, that, in tacking to the &s;outhward, on her fir&s;t approach towards the i&s;land, &s;he had &s;prung her fore-top-ma&s;t, which had di&s;abled her from working to wind|ward, and prevented her from joining us &s;ooner. We now &s;cuttled and &s;unk the Je&s;u Nazareno, and, on the 12th of December, &s;tood to the we&s;tward, having previou&s;ly delivered fre&s;h in&s;tructions for the conduct of the fleet. We had now little doubt of arriving &s;oon e|nough upon our intended &s;tation, as we expect|ed, upon the increa&s;ing our offing from Quibo, to fall in with the regular trade-wind, but, to our extreme vexation, we were baffled for near a month, &s;o that it was the 25th of December before we &s;aw the i&s;land of Cocos, which, ac|cording to our reckoning, was only 100 leagues from the continent, and even then we had the mortification to make &s;o little way, that we did not lo&s;e &s;ight of that i&s;land again in five days. This i&s;land we found to be in the lat. of 5 deg. 20 min. N.</P>
<P>We had flattered our&s;elves, that the uncertain and we&s;tern gales we met with were owing to the neighbourhood of the continent, from which,
<PB N="342" REF="353">
as we got more di&s;tant, we hoped to be relieved by falling in with the ea&s;tern trade-wind; but in this too being di&s;appointed, we began at length to de&s;pair of the great purpo&s;e we had in view. This produced a general dejection a|mong us, as we had at fir&s;t con&s;idered the pro|ject as almo&s;t infallible, and had indulged our|&s;elves in the mo&s;t boundle&s;s hopes of the advan|tages we &s;hould thence receive. However, our de&s;pondency was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, alleviated by a favourable change of the wind; and, as we now advanced a-pace towards our &s;tation, our hopes began again to revive. On the 17th of January, we were advanced to the lat. of 12 deg. 50 min. N. and, on the 26th of Ja|nuary, finding our&s;elves to the northward of Acapulco, we tacked and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward, with a view of making the land; and we ex|pected, by our reckonings, to have fallen in with it on the 28th, yet, though the weather was perfectly clear, we had no &s;ign of it at &s;un|&s;et; about ten at night we di&s;covered a light on the larboard bow, bearing from us N. N. E. and, &s;oon after, the Trial's prize made the &s;ig|nal for &s;eeing a &s;ail. As we had none of us any doubt but that what we &s;aw was a &s;hip's light, we were all extremely animated with a firm per&s;ua|&s;ion that it was the Manilla galleon, that had been &s;o long the object of our wi&s;hes. We immediately ca&s;t off the Carmelo, and pre&s;&s;ed forward with all our canvas, making a &s;ignal for the Glouce&s;ter to do the &s;ame. Thus we
<PB N="343" REF="354">
chaced the light, keeping all our hands at their re&s;pective quarters, under an expectation of en|gaging within half an hour, as we &s;ometimes con|ceived the chace to be about a mile di&s;tant, and at other times to be within reach of our guns. In this con&s;tant and eager attention we conti|nued all night, always pre&s;uming that another quarter of an hour would bring us up to this Manilla &s;hip, who&s;e wealth we now e&s;timated at round millions: but, when day-light came, we were mo&s;t vexatiou&s;ly di&s;appointed, by finding that the light which had occa&s;ioned all this ex|pectancy, was only a fire on the &s;hore. At &s;un|ri&s;ing, after this mortifying delu&s;ion, we found our&s;elves about nine leagues off land, extending from the N. W. to E. half N. On this land we ob&s;erved two remarkable hammocks, which bore N. from us, and which a Spani&s;h pilot and two Indians affirmed to be over the harbour of Acapulco; but we found them egregiou&s;ly mi&s;|taken, the&s;e being in 17 deg. 56 min. whereas Acapulco lies in 17 deg. only.</P>
<P>Being now in the track of the Manilla gal|leon, it was a doubt with us, as it was near the end of January, whether &s;he was or was not ar|rived: but, examining our pri&s;oners about it, they a&s;&s;ured us, &s;he was &s;ometimes known to come in after the middle of February; and they endeavoured to per&s;uade us, that the fire we had &s;een on &s;hore was a proof that &s;he was yet at &s;ea, it being cu&s;tomary, as they &s;aid, to make u&s;e of the&s;e fires as &s;ignals for her direction when
<PB N="344" REF="355">
&s;he continued out longer than ordinary. On this rea&s;oning of our pri&s;oners, we re&s;olved to crui&s;e for her &s;ome days, and we accordingly &s;pread our &s;hips at the di&s;tance of 12 leagues from the coa&s;t, in &s;uch a manner that it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould pa&s;s us unob&s;erved; however, not &s;eeing her &s;oon, we were very &s;olicitous to gain &s;ome po&s;itive intelligence. With this view the Commodore re&s;olved to &s;end a boat under cover of the night into the harbour of Acapulco, to &s;ee if the Manilla &s;hip was there or not. To ex|ecute this enterprize, the barge was di&s;patched the 6th of February, carrying a &s;ufficient crew and two officers, as al&s;o a Spani&s;h pilot and an Indian. Our barge did not return till the 11th, when the officers acquainted Mr. An&s;on, that they had mi&s;taken the harbour, and that Aca|pulco lay a con&s;iderable di&s;tance more to the ea&s;tward, and that, not having a &s;ufficient quan|tity of provi&s;ions for their pa&s;&s;age thither, they were obliged to return to make known their di&s;|appointment. On this intelligence we made &s;ail to the ea&s;tward, and the next day we di&s;patched the barge, with particular in&s;tructions to keep at a &s;ufficient di&s;tance not to be &s;een from the &s;hore. We watched &s;ix days without receiving any intelligence, &s;o that we began to be unea&s;y for her &s;afety; but on the 7th day &s;he returned with advice, that, being at the very place they &s;ought for, though they were then ignorant of their &s;ituation, they &s;urprized a fi&s;hing canoe with three negroes, who told us that the Manilla
<PB N="345" REF="356">
galleon arrived at Acapulco on the 9th of Ja|nuary, but that, having delivered her cargo, &s;he was taking in water and provi&s;ions in order to return; and that the Viceroy of Mexico had by proclamation fixed her departure from Aca|pulco to the 14th of March. This la&s;t news was mo&s;t joyfully received by us, &s;ince we had no doubt but &s;he mu&s;t fall into our hands; and it was much more eligible to &s;eize her on her return, than it would have been to have taken her before her arrival, as the money for which &s;he had &s;old her cargo, and which &s;he would now have on board, would be much more e&s;teemed by us than the cargo it&s;elf. Thus we were a &s;econd time engaged in an eager expec|tation of meeting with this Manilla &s;hip, which, by the &s;ame of its wealth, we had been taught to con&s;ider as the mo&s;t de&s;irable capture that was to be made on any part of the ocean.</P>
<P>As it was the 19th of February when the barge returned, and brought us our intelligence, and the galleon was not to &s;ail till the 3d of March, the Commodore re&s;olved to continue the great|e&s;t part of the intermediate time in his pre&s;ent &s;tation to the we&s;tward of Acapulco, in order to avoid a di&s;covery from the &s;hore. During this interval we were employed in getting all things in readine&s;s to engage; and, when the long-wi&s;hed-for 3d of March came, we were all &s;o &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the certainty of our intelligence, and with an a&s;&s;urance of her com|ing out of port, that &s;ome or other of us were
<PB N="346" REF="357">
con&s;tantly imagining that they di&s;covered one of our cutters returning with a &s;ignal; but, to our extreme vexation, both this day and the &s;uc|ceeding night pa&s;&s;ed away without any news of her approach. However, we did not yet de|&s;pair, nor did we abate of our vigilance: but, after remaining till the 25th of March, we at length concluded, and we afterwards found it to be true, that we had been di&s;covered, and that in con&s;equence an embargo had been laid upon the galleon, and her departure po&s;tponed till the next year.</P>
<P>The cutters, having on that day fini&s;hed their crui&s;e before the harbour, returned to the &s;qua|dron, and the &s;ignal being given for the fleet to join, it was determined to retire to Chequetan, to take in a fre&s;h &s;upply of water, which was then nearly exhau&s;ted. In the mean time, a cutter, commanded by Mr. Hughes, Lieutenant of the Trial's prize, was ordered to continue off the harbour of Acapulco for 24 days, in order that, if the galleon &s;hould &s;et &s;ail in that time, we might be &s;peedily informed of it.</P>
<P>On the 5th of April we entered the harbour of Chequetan, in lat. 17 deg. 36 min. N. about 30 leagues to the we&s;tward of Acapulco. The watering-place has the appearance of a large &s;tanding lake, without any vi&s;ible outlet into the &s;ea, from which it is &s;eparated by a part of the &s;trand. The origin of this lake is a &s;pring that bubbles out of the ground, near half a mile within the country. We found its water a little
<PB N="347" REF="358">
bracki&s;h, but more con&s;iderably &s;o towards the &s;ea &s;ide; for the nearer we advanced towards the &s;pring-head, the &s;ofter and fre&s;her it proved. This laid us under a nece&s;&s;ity of filling all our ca&s;ks from the farthe&s;t part of the lake, which was facilitated by means of canoes which tra|ver&s;ed the lake, and brought a number of &s;mall ca&s;ks to the &s;ide next the beach; thence the wa|ter was &s;tarted into larger ve&s;&s;els in the boats, and by that contrivance brought on board with very little trouble.</P>
<P>As the country hereabouts, particularly the tract of coa&s;t contiguous to Acapulco, appear|ed to be well peopled and cultivated, we hoped to have ea&s;ily procured from thence &s;ome fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and other refre&s;hments, which we now &s;tood much in need of. To facilitate the&s;e views, the Commodore, the morning after we came to an anchor, ordered a party of 40 men well armed to march into the country, and to endeavour to di&s;cover &s;ome town where they were to attempt to &s;et on foot a corre&s;pondence with the inhabitants; for, when we had once begun this intercour&s;e, we doubted not but by proper pre&s;ents we &s;hould allure them to bring down to us whatever fruits or fre&s;h provi&s;ions were in their power. As our prizes abounded with various &s;orts of coar&s;e merchandize, which were of little con&s;equence to us, though to them they would be extremely valuable, our people were directed on this occa&s;ion to proceed with the greate&s;t circum&s;pection, and to make as little
<PB N="348" REF="359">
o&s;tentation of ho&s;tility as po&s;&s;ible; for we were &s;en&s;ible we could find no wealth in tho&s;e parts worth our notice; and what nece&s;&s;aries we real|ly wanted, we expected would be better, and more abundantly &s;upplied, by an open, amicable traffic, than by violence and force of arms. But this endeavour of opening a commerce with the inhabitants proved ineffectual, and therefore we de&s;i&s;ted from any more attempts of the &s;ame nature, contenting our&s;elves with what we could procure for our&s;elves in the neighbourhood of the port where we lay. We caught fi&s;h in abun|dance; among the re&s;t cavallies, bream, mul|lets, &s;oals, fiddle-fi&s;h, and lob&s;ters; and we here, and in no other place, met with that extraordi|nary fi&s;h called the Torpedo, which is in &s;hape very much re&s;embling the fiddle-fi&s;h, and is on|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed from it in appearance by a brown circular &s;pot of about the bigne&s;s of a crown-piece near the center of its back. This fi&s;h is, indeed, of a mo&s;t &s;ingular nature, be|numbing whoever touches it all over his body, but more particularly that limb which happens to come in immediate contact with it. The &s;ame effect, too, will be in &s;ome degree produced by touching the fi&s;h with any thing held in the hand; and it has lately been di&s;covered, that it may be communicated like the electrical &s;hock to a large circle, by means of a certain appara|tus much more &s;imple than that which is u&s;ed in experiments in electricity.</P>
<P>The animals which we met with on &s;hore
<PB N="349" REF="360">
were chiefly guanoes, with which the country abounds, and which are by &s;ome reckoned deli|cious food. We &s;aw no bea&s;ts of prey, except we &s;hould e&s;teem that amphibious creature the alligator as &s;uch, &s;everal of which our people di&s;covered, but none of them very large. It is, however, certain, that there were great numbers of tygers in the woods, though none of them happened to make their appearance while we remained upon the coa&s;t. Parrots and phea|&s;ants were found in plenty, but by no means proper for food, being dry and ta&s;tele&s;s, though they were often killed and eaten, being by &s;ome thought preferable to &s;alt provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The papah, lime, and a little &s;our plumb, were all the fruits the woods furni&s;hed, and of the&s;e there were but a &s;canty portion; nor was there any other u&s;eful vegetable, except brook|lime, which, being e&s;teemed an anti&s;corbutic, was frequently eaten, though from its bitterne&s;s it was exceedingly unpalatable.</P>
<P>While we lay at Chequetan, it was re&s;olved, after mature deliberation, to de&s;troy all our prizes, as the whole number of men on board our &s;quadron did not amount to the comple|ment of a fourth-rate man of-war. It was there|fore judged mo&s;t prudent to &s;et fire to the &s;hips, and to divide the men between the Centurion and Glouce&s;ter, now preparing to &s;et &s;ail for China. Be&s;ides the nece&s;&s;ary repairs for a voyage of &s;uch length, the removal of their &s;tores and cargoes into the men-of-war took up &s;o much
<PB N="350" REF="361">
time, that it was the end of April before we were in a condition to leave the place.</P>
<P>It &s;hould have been remarked, that, from this harbour of Chequetan we di&s;covered but one pathway through the woods into the country; and as this was much beaten, we were from that circum&s;tance convinced, that it was not unfre|quented by the natives. As it pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;pring-head, and was the only avenue by which the Spaniards could approach to &s;urprize us, we at &s;ome di&s;tance beyond the &s;pring-head felled &s;everal large trees, and laid them one upon ano|ther acro&s;s the path, and at this barricadoe we con&s;tantly kept a guard. We, be&s;ides, ordered our men employed in watering, to have their arms always in readine&s;s, in ca&s;e of an alarm, and to march in&s;tantly to this po&s;t. And, though our principal intention herein was to prevent our being di&s;turbed by the enemy's hor&s;e, yet it an|&s;wered another purpo&s;e, which was, to hinder our people from &s;traggling &s;ingly into the coun|try, where we had rea&s;on to believe they would be &s;urprized by the Spaniards, who would doubt|le&s;s be very &s;olicitous to pick up &s;ome of them, in hopes of getting intelligence of our future de&s;igns. To avoid this inconvenience the &s;tric|te&s;t orders were given to the centinels, to let no per&s;on whatever pa&s;s beyond this po&s;t; but, notwith&s;tanding this precaution, we mi&s;&s;ed one Lewis Legere, who was the Commodore's cook. As he was a Frenchman and a Roman Catholic, it was at fir&s;t imagined that lie had de&s;erted
<PB N="351" REF="362">
with a view of betraying all that he knew to the enemy; though this appeared, by the event, to be an ill-grounded &s;urmi&s;e; for it was after|wards known, that he had been taken by &s;ome Indians, who carried him pri&s;oner to Acapulco, from whence he was tran&s;ported to Mexico, and thence to Vera Cruz, where he was &s;hipped on board a ve&s;&s;el bound to Old Spain. But, the ve&s;&s;el being obliged, by &s;ome accident, to put into Li&s;bon, Legere e&s;caped on &s;hore, and was by the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul &s;ent from thence to Eng|land; where he gave the fir&s;t authentic account of the &s;afety of the Commodore, and of his principal tran&s;actions in the South Seas.</P>
<P>The relation he gave of his own &s;eizure, was, that he rambled into the woods, at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the barricadoe where he had fir&s;t attemped to pa&s;s, but had been &s;topt and threatened to be puni&s;hed; that his principal view was to gather a quantity of limes for his ma&s;ter's &s;tores; and that in this occupation he was &s;urprized unawares by four Indians, who &s;tript him naked, and carried him in that con|dition to Acapulco, expo&s;ed to the &s;corching heat of the &s;un, which at that time of the year &s;hone with its greate&s;t violence; that afterwards, at Mexico, his treatment was &s;ufficiently &s;evere; &s;o that the whole cour&s;e of his captivity was a continued in&s;tance of the hatred which the Spa|niards bear to all tho&s;e who endeavour to di&s;|turb them in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the coa&s;ts of the South Seas. Indeed, Legere's
<PB N="352" REF="363">
fortune was, upon the whole, extremely &s;ingu|lar; as, after the hazards he had run in the Commodore's &s;quadron, and the &s;everities he had &s;uffered in his long confinement among the enemy, a more fatal di&s;a&s;ter attended him on his return to England; for though, when he arrived in London, &s;ome of Mr. An&s;on's friends intere&s;ted them&s;elves in relieving him from the poverty to which his captivity had reduced him, yet he did not long enjoy the benefit of their humanity, &s;ince he was killed in an in&s;ignificant night-brawl, the cau&s;e of which could &s;carcely ever be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>When we were nece&s;&s;itated to proceed to Chequetan to recruit our water, the Commo|dore con&s;idered that our arrival in that harbour would &s;oon be known at Acapulco; and there|fore he hoped, that on the intelligence of our being employed in that port, the galleon might put to &s;ea, e&s;pecially as Chequetan is &s;o very remote from the cour&s;e generally &s;teered by the galleons: he therefore ordered the cutter, as has already been noticed, to crui&s;e twenty-four days off the Port of Acapulco, and her Commander was directed, on perceiving the galleon under &s;ail, to make the be&s;t of his way to the Com|modore at Chequetan. As the Centurion was certainly a much better &s;ailor than the galleon, Mr. An&s;on, in this ca&s;e, re&s;olved to have got to &s;ea as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and to have pur&s;ued the galleon acro&s;s the Pacific Ocean; however,
<PB N="353" REF="364">
the Viceroy of Mexico ruined this project, by detaining the galleon in port all the year.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of April, all things being in readine&s;s for &s;ailing, the Centurion and Glouce&s;ter weighed anchor; and, after having gained an offing, the prizes were &s;et on fire, and a canoe fixed to a grapple in the middle of the harbour, with a bottle in it, well corked, inclo&s;ing a letter to Mr. Hughes, directing him to go back immediately to his former &s;tation before Acapulco, where he would find Mr. An&s;on, who re&s;olved to crui&s;e for him in that &s;tation &s;ome days. Indeed, it was no &s;mall mor|tification to us, now we were at &s;ea, and the &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on approaching, that we were de|tained by the ab&s;ence of the cutter, and under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tanding towards Acapulco in &s;earch of her. As the time of her crui&s;e had been expired near a fortnight, we &s;u&s;pected that &s;he had been di&s;covered from the &s;hore, and that the Governor of Acapulco had there|upon &s;ent out: force to &s;eize her; which, as &s;he carried but &s;ix hands, was no very difficult enterprize. However, this being only conjec|ture, the Commodore, as &s;oon as he was got clear of the harbour of Chequetan, &s;tood along the coa&s;t to the ea&s;tward in &s;earch of her; and, to prevent her from pa&s;&s;ing by us in the dark, we brought-to every night, and carried lights which the cutter could not but perceive.</P>
<P>By the 2d of May we were advanced within three leagues of Acapulco; and, having &s;een
<PB N="354" REF="365">
nothing of our boat, we gave her over for lo&s;t; which, be&s;ides the compa&s;&s;ionate concern for our &s;hipmates, and for what it was apprehended they might have &s;uffered, was in it&s;elf a mi&s;|fortune, which in our pre&s;ent &s;carcity of hands we were greatly intere&s;ted in; &s;ince the crew of the cutter were the flower of our people, pur|po&s;ely picked out for this &s;ervice, as known to be, every one of them, of tried and approved re&s;olution, and as &s;kilful &s;eamen as ever trod a deck. However, as it was the general belief among us, that they were taken and carried into Acapulco, the Commodore's prudence &s;ugge&s;ted a project which we hoped would recover them. This was founded on our having many Spani&s;h and Indian pri&s;oners on board, &s;ome of them of quality. The Commodore, therefore, wrote a letter to the Governor of Acapulco, telling him, that he would relea&s;e them all, provided the Governor returned the cutter's crew. This letter was di&s;patched by a Spani&s;h officer, of who&s;e honour we had a high opinion, and who was furni&s;hed with a launch belonging to one of our prizes, and a crew of Spaniards, who gave their parole for their return. The Spani&s;h officer, too, be&s;ides the Commodore's letter, car|ried with him a joint petition, &s;igned by all the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners, be&s;eeching the Governor to acquie&s;ce in the terms propo&s;ed for their li|berty. But while we were thus contriving their relea&s;e, the centinel called out from the ma&s;t-head, that he &s;aw a boat under &s;ail at a con&s;i|derable
<PB N="355" REF="366">
di&s;tance to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward, which, to our un&s;peakable joy, upon her nearer ap|proach, we found was our own cutter, the wan and meagre countenances of who&s;e crew, the length of their beards, and the feeble and hol|low tone of their voices, convinced us that they had &s;uffered much greater hard&s;hips than could be expected from even the &s;everities of a Spa|ni&s;h pri&s;on. They were obliged to be helped into the &s;hip, and were immediately put to bed; where, by re&s;t, and nouri&s;hing diet, with which they were plentifully &s;upplied from the Com|modore's table, they recovered their health and vigour. And now we learnt that they had kept the &s;ea the whole time of their ab&s;ence, which was above &s;ix weeks; that, when they had fini&s;hed their crui&s;e, and had ju&s;t begun to ply to the we&s;tward, in order to join the &s;quadron, a &s;trong adver&s;e current had forced them upwards of 80 leagues to leeward, where they found every where &s;o great a &s;urf, that there was no po&s;&s;i|bility of landing; that they pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days in the mo&s;t dreadful &s;ituation, without water, having no other means left them to allay their thir&s;t than &s;ucking the blood of the turtles which they caught; that at la&s;t, giving up all hopes of &s;uccour, the heat of the climate too augmenting their nece&s;&s;ities, and rendering their &s;ufferings in&s;upportable, they abandoned them|&s;elves to de&s;pair, fully per&s;uaded that they &s;hould peri&s;h by the mo&s;t terrible of all deaths; but that &s;oon after a mo&s;t unexpected incident
<PB N="356" REF="367">
happily relieved them; for there fell &s;o heavy a rain, that, on &s;preading their &s;ails horizontally, and putting bullets in the centers of them, they caught as much water as filled their ca&s;ks; that immediately upon this fortunate &s;upply, they &s;tood to the we&s;tward in que&s;t of the Commodore, and being now luckily favoured by a &s;trong current, they joined him in le&s;s than 50 hours from that time, after having been ab|&s;ent in the whole full 43 days.</P>
<P>And now having, to our entire &s;atisfaction, got on board our people, and the &s;ea&s;on of the year for &s;ailing to A&s;ia being far (we found it too far) advanced, the Commodore re&s;olved not to wait for any return from Acapulco, but gave orders to equip two large prize launches, to carry on &s;hore the Spani&s;h and Indian pri&s;oners, both from our&s;elves and the Glouce&s;ter; and, having given them provi&s;ions and all nece&s;&s;aries for Panama, whither they intended to &s;ail, a|bout four in the evening they left us, to the number of about &s;ixty per&s;ons, having fir&s;t, though enemies, ob&s;erved the cu&s;tom of &s;ea|faring people at parting, and wi&s;hed us a pro&s;|perous voyage.</P>
<P>From the 6th of May, the day we took our departure, we met with little remarkable for above a month, except that the true trade-wind, which is &s;aid never to fail at about &s;ixty or &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">venty leagues from the &s;hore of Mexico at the farthe&s;t, was &s;o far from an&s;wering our ex|pectations, that we had nothing but cro&s;s winds,

&s;qualls, rain, thunder and lightning, till by ac|count we were 600 leagues to the we&s;tward of Acapulco, having been above 40 days in getting &s;o far. The 9th, we found the forema&s;t &s;prung in a dangerous manner, and thereupon fi&s;hed and &s;ecured it very &s;trongly.</P>
<P>The 22d in the evening, we &s;prung a leak, making 12 inches water in a watch, and on a &s;earch found it to be on the larboard &s;ide, a|brea&s;t the main hatch-way, and not quite under water. The carpenters &s;oon &s;topt it with very little trouble.</P>
<P>The 11th of June, we found a current to &s;et to the &s;outhward, about 24 miles a day, but could not di&s;cover whether to the ea&s;t or we&s;t, for want of opportunity to try it. This was by account about 450 leagues from Acapulco; and, much about this time, abundance of &s;corbutic &s;ymptoms, &s;uch as blackne&s;s in the &s;kin, hard nodes in the fle&s;h, &s;hortne&s;s of breath, and a general la&s;&s;itude and weakne&s;s of all the parts, began to prevail, almo&s;t univer&s;ally, among our people. This, with the great mortality we experienced from this di&s;temper in our Cape Horn pa&s;&s;age, and the time we might &s;till ex|pect to be at &s;ea, having yet 1800 leagues to tho&s;e i&s;lands called, by Sir Francis Drake, the Ladrones, or I&s;lands of Thieves, from the thievi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants, but by the Spaniards the Marian I&s;lands, where only we could expect our next refre&s;hments; and no trade-wind being yet &s;ettled;&mdash;the&s;e con&s;i|derations,
<PB N="358" REF="369">
I &s;ay, gave us dreadful apprehen|&s;ions of what this pa&s;&s;age might terminate in; and the event &s;hewed that we had but too much rea&s;on for them.</P>
<P>The 14th, at five in the evening, the Glou|ce&s;ter, having &s;prung the head of her main-ma&s;t, 12 feet below the tru&s;&s;el-trees, fired a gun as a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, on which we brought to, and waited for her; and, after enquiring into, and hearing the cau&s;e, we &s;ent them on board two carpenters to a&s;&s;i&s;t in fi&s;hing and &s;ecuring it; but the carpenters in concert, having viewed and con&s;idered the damage, reported, the next day, that the ma&s;t was unfit to &s;tand, and would not bear repairing; but that it mu&s;t be &s;hortened 26 feet from the head, and the top-ma&s;t be &s;et on the &s;tump. This, therefore, was concluded on, and ordered accordingly.</P>
<P>The 23d, we found our own main-top-ma&s;t &s;prung in the wake of the cap; whereupon we reefed it 20 inches, that is, we lowered it &s;o much, and &s;ecured it there, and fleeted and &s;et up the &s;hrouds and back-&s;tays.</P>
<P>The 24th, in the evening, we got the top-ma&s;t down, and put up another in its place, and a man falling overboard, we brought the &s;hip to, and took him up &s;afe; likewi&s;e, the &s;lings of our cro&s;sjack-yards being broke, we fixed new ones, and the next day got up the fore-top-gal|lant ma&s;t and yard.</P>
<P>The 27th, we made the Glouce&s;ter &s;ignal, and &s;ent our boat on board of her.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="370">The 28th, we received from the Glouce&s;ter half an anchor-&s;tock, for a farther &s;ecurity to the fore-ma&s;t.</P>
<P>The 29th, the Glouce&s;ter fini&s;hed her jury-ma&s;t, and made &s;ail on it. Nothing farther remarkable till</P>
<P>July 1&s;t, we had fre&s;h gales, and cloudy wea|ther, with &s;ome lightning.</P>
<P>The 2d, we unbent the fore-&s;ail, and bent ano|ther. We had, not only now, but for almo&s;t our whole pa&s;&s;age, abundance of birds of prey, al&s;o flying fi&s;h, which are their proper food, and va&s;t quantities of &s;kipjacks, albicores, &amp;c. whereof we took a great number, which contri|buted much to our refre&s;hment after the lo&s;s of the tortoi&s;es, that generally leave all &s;hips about twenty or thirty leagues off the land. I think this the more worthy of notice, becau&s;e Dampier, Rogers, Cook, Cowley, and mo&s;t other voyagers, &s;ome of whom have been not only once, but &s;everal times on this voyage, have reported, that they never &s;aw a fi&s;h or fowl in this whole run. I will not &s;ay, as Mr. Cook frequently does, when any other per&s;on's account does not happen to &s;quare exactly with what him&s;elf has ob&s;erved, viz. <Q REND="inline">"What credit is to be given to &s;uch authors?"</Q> never making allowances for contingencies which might or might not happen, and which would better have di&s;played his own impartiality, than a dogmatical condemnation of every other per&s;on, without
<PB N="260" REF="371">
examination. For my part, I readily believe and conclude, that this difference in our ob&s;er|vations and accounts is really occa&s;ioned by the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year in which we happen|ed to perform this pa&s;&s;age; it being a known truth, and confirmed by the experience of thou|&s;ands in all ages, that mo&s;t fi&s;h have their diffe|rent &s;ea&s;ons for their different rendezvou&s;es.</P>
<P>The 10th, we &s;aw three gannets, or, as they call them in Scotland, &s;oland gee&s;e; being, by what I can learn from the mo&s;t intelligent of that nation whom I have conver&s;ed with, and who often have opportunity to ob&s;erve them in &s;everal different parts, of one and the &s;ame &s;pe|cies; we likewi&s;e &s;aw &s;ome &s;ee weeds; both which circum&s;tances made us imagine that &s;ome i&s;lands or &s;hoals were not far off, tho&s;e fowls never being ob&s;erved to fly very far out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>The 10th, we unbent the fore-top-&s;ail, and bent another.</P>
<P>The 12th, at noon, we were, by my account, 180 deg. 11 min. to the we&s;tward of the meri|dian of London, which is ju&s;t 11 min. more than half round the globe, for which rea&s;on I note it. We were at this time, by my account, 1429 leagues di&s;tant from the port of Acapulco.</P>
<P>From this time till the 16th we had fre&s;h gales, with &s;qualls and rain.</P>
<P>The 17th and 18th, we had moderate and cloudy weather.</P>
<P>The 19th and 20th, fre&s;h gales, with abun|dance
<PB N="361" REF="372">
of rain. We made this ob&s;ervation, that, with rainy weather, or even &s;light tran&s;ient &s;howers, the fi&s;h bit more freely, and were caught in greater numbers, than with fair wea|ther; which made our fi&s;hermen the more at|tentive at &s;uch times. It was likewi&s;e remark|ed, that the Glouce&s;ter, when they could find opportunity to fi&s;h, had always much greater &s;ucce&s;s than we; whether their fi&s;hermen had more art than ours, or whatever el&s;e occa&s;ioned it, the fact is true. They had al&s;o a better way of di&s;po&s;ing of them, when taken, if I may be allowed to judge, than we; for Capt. Mitchell con&s;tantly ordered &s;everal boys, who were very dexterous at it, to catch fi&s;h for the &s;hip's company, e&s;pecially the &s;ick; and tho&s;e were very ju&s;tly and regularly divided among them: whereas our fi&s;hermen were left at liberty to make their advantage of what they took, and to prey upon their &s;uffering &s;hipmates; and they took care not to over&s;lip the opportunity, for the lea&s;t fi&s;h you could purcha&s;e of them would co&s;t you a bottle of brandy; which, at this time, was worth four, or perhaps &s;ix, and &s;ometimes even eight &s;hillings, or half a guinea; and you mu&s;t be very thankful, and acknowledge your&s;elf to be highly obliged into the bargain, or el&s;e ex|pect none next time, and very often fail of it notwith&s;tanding. About this time our people began to die very fa&s;t, and, I believe, above five parts out of &s;ix of the &s;hip's company were ill, and expected to follow in a &s;hort time.
<PB N="362" REF="373">
Tho&s;e, who&s;e breath was any ways affected, dropt off immediately; but tho&s;e. who were attacked fir&s;t in the more remote parts of the body, langui&s;hed generally a month or &s;ix weeks; the di&s;temper advancing, in the mean time, towards the lungs, by a very regular and &s;en&s;ible approach. As I was my&s;elf one of tho&s;e who were &s;everely afflicted in this latter manner, I &s;hall give &s;uch an account of its pro|gre&s;s, as I found by experience in my&s;elf, and corroborated by the &s;imilar report of my fellow-&s;ufferers. I was fir&s;t taken, about the begin|ning of this month, with a &s;light pain on the joint of my left great toe; but, having hurt that a little while before, I imagined it to be the effect of that hurt, and minded it the le&s;s&mdash;(but here I &s;hall ob&s;erve, once for all, that if ever any part of the body had received a brui&s;e, &s;train, or contu&s;ion, if not perfectly cured, the &s;curvy was &s;ure to attack that part fir&s;t); but, in a lit|tle time, a large black &s;pot appearing on the part affected, with very inten&s;e pains at the bone, gave me to under&s;tand my ca&s;e. I now took phy&s;ic often, by way of prevention, but to little purpo&s;e: &s;everal hard nodes now began to ri&s;e in my legs, thighs, and arms, and not only many more black &s;pots appeared in the &s;kin, but tho&s;e &s;pread, till my legs and thighs were for the mo&s;t part as black as a negroe; and this ac|companied with &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive pains in the joints of the knees, ancles, and toes, as I thought, before I experienced them, that human nature
<PB N="363" REF="374">
could never have &s;upported. It next advanced to the mouth; all my teeth were pre&s;ently loo&s;e, and my gums, over-charged with extrava&s;ated blood, fell down almo&s;t quite over my teeth: this occa&s;ioned my breath to &s;mell much, yet without affecting my lungs; but, I believe, one week more at &s;ea would have ended me, and le&s;s than a month more, all the re&s;t. One thing was very remarkable, and likewi&s;e univer|&s;al, which was, that, when the di&s;temper had far prevailed, if the afflicted per&s;on lay quiet in his hammock, he &s;eemed to be perfectly well and hearty; but, if he was removed out of it, on any nece&s;&s;ity, he immediately fainted away; and this was always a &s;ure &s;ign of the party's di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Since our pa&s;&s;ing Cape Horn, our &s;urgeon, Henry Ettrick, who was a very good practical &s;ur|geon, had been very bu&s;y in dige&s;ting a theory of &s;curvies, wherein he enumerated many ca&s;es very particularly, having been allowed to open and examine as many bodies as were abundantly &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. His &s;y&s;tem was principally grounded on the ob&s;ervations made on a long pa&s;&s;age in a very cold climate. He took abundance of pains to prove, by many in&s;tances, that the tone of the blood was broken by the cold nipping air, and rendered &s;o thin, as to be unfit for circulation, or any other of the u&s;es of life; and being thus deprived of a proper force and vigour, &s;tagnation and death mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue. From this &s;uppo&s;ition,
<PB N="364" REF="375">
he had laid it down as an infallible rule, that food of a glutinous nature, &s;uch as &s;alt fi&s;h, bread, and &s;everal &s;orts of grain, were alone proper on &s;uch voyages. As for liquids, I know not which he had pitched on, as the mo&s;t &s;alu|tary, on this occa&s;ion. But this pa&s;&s;age, in a very hot climate, where the &s;ymptoms were not only more dreadful, but the mortality much more quick and fatal, in proportion to the num|ber of people, put our &s;cheming doctor to a &s;ad non-plus: he could not account for this on the &s;ame principles with the other; nay, they mu&s;t be, in a manner, diametrically oppo&s;ite. All this obliged him at la&s;t (though he was &s;till endeavouring to reconcile contradictions), to own, that, though &s;ome of the concurrent cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e were plain enough, yet the grand cau&s;e was certainly the long continu|ance at &s;ea, or an entire &s;ecret; and that no cure but the &s;hore would ever be effectual. The Commodore, on this great mortality, having by him a quantity of Ward's pills and drops, in order to experience whether they would be of any u&s;e, fir&s;t tried them on him&s;elf, and then gave what he had left to the &s;urgeon, to admi|ni&s;ter to &s;uch of the &s;ick people as were willing to take them. The &s;urgeon would not recom|mend them to any per&s;on, but &s;everal took them; though I know of none who believed they were of any &s;ervice to them. They worked mo&s;t people who took them very violently, both by vomit and &s;tool: after which, as &s;everal told
<PB N="365" REF="376">
me, they would &s;eem to be a little ea&s;ier, tho' weaker, for perhaps a day or two, but then they always relap&s;ed, and became wor&s;e than before; and this, together with the inefficacy of all that our &s;urgeons could do in the ca&s;e, &s;ufficiently &s;hewed the vanity of attempting the cure of this di&s;temper at &s;ea.</P>
<P>And here, before I quit this &s;ubject, I &s;hall endeavour to remove a prejudice, under which the afflicted have long &s;everely &s;uffered; and that is, from the notion generally prevalent, that none but the lazy are attacked with this di&s;order; whereas, the direct contrary is the truth; our experience having abundantly &s;hewn, that the mo&s;t laborious, active, &s;tirring per&s;ons were oftene&s;t &s;eized with this di&s;ea&s;e; and the continuation of their labour, in&s;tead of curing, only helped to kill them the &s;ooner.</P>
<P>Many undeniable in&s;tances might be given of this in our voyage; and, if future voyagers will give them&s;elves the trouble of ob&s;erving this hereafter, I am certain that the event will corre&s;pond with my a&s;&s;ertion; nor does this di&s;temper, in a general way, incline people to indolence, till it is come to that height, that, at the lea&s;t motion, the per&s;on is ready to faint. It is certain, that, if the per&s;on afflicted de&s;ires to lengthen out his life as long as he can, his be&s;t way is to &s;tir as little as po&s;&s;ible. This I have &s;een verified by many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>The 23d and 24th, we reefed and repaired our
<PB N="366" REF="377">
rigging, which had &s;uffered much in the va|riable weather.</P>
<P>The 26th, being, according to our reckoning, 300 leagues from the Ladrones, we met with a we&s;terly wind, which did not come about again in four days. This was a mo&s;t di&s;piriting inci|dent, as we were all that while forced to lie to, the current in&s;en&s;ibly driving us out of our cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The 27th, our gunner, Henry Kipps, died of the &s;curvy, being one of the mo&s;t able-bodied men, as well as the mo&s;t active in the &s;hip: he had taken Ward's medicines once or twice.</P>
<P>On the 28th, we had calms with much rain, and received from the Glouce&s;ter 20 ca&s;ks of flour and four of groats. Having here an oc|ca&s;ion of mentioning flour, it may not be ami&s;s to take notice, that, &s;ince our departure from Juan Fernandez, the principal officers had al|ways &s;oft bread new baked, the bi&s;cuit being &s;o much worm-eaten, it was &s;carce any thing but du&s;t, and a little blow would reduce it to that &s;tate immediately. Our beef and pork were like|wi&s;e very ru&s;ty and rotten; and the &s;urgeon en|deavoured to per&s;uade us from eating it, alledg|ing it was, though a &s;low, yet a &s;ure poi&s;on; but very little other food being to be had, we were reduced to a very deplorable condition.</P>
<P>The 29th, in the morning, the Glouce&s;ter's fore cap &s;plitting, her fore-top-ma&s;t came by the board, and, in its fall, meeting with the fore-yard, broke it in the &s;lings. As &s;he was hereby ren|dered
<PB N="367" REF="378">
incapable of making any &s;ail for &s;ome time, we were under a nece&s;&s;ity, as &s;oon as a gale &s;prung up, to take her in tow, and near 20 of the healthie&s;t and able&s;t of our &s;eamen were re|moved from the duty of our own &s;hip, and were continued eight or ten days together to a&s;&s;i&s;t in repairing her damages; but the&s;e things, morti|fying as we thought them, were only the com|mencement of our misfortunes; for, &s;carce had our people fini&s;hed their bu&s;ine&s;s in the Glou|ce&s;ter, before we met with a mo&s;t violent &s;torm from the we&s;tern board, which obliged us to lie to. This &s;torm la&s;ted from the 10th to the 13th of Augu&s;t, attended with rain, thunder, and lightning, and &s;uch a lofty and dangerous &s;ea as I have &s;eldom &s;een, and could not have believed in latitudes between the Tropics, e&s;pecially for &s;uch a long duration. Mo&s;t of the time we lay to, we drove to the northward; abundance of our people died daily; and, the &s;hip proving very leaky, every per&s;on who could &s;tir, the principal officers not excepted, was obliged to take his turn at the pumps, and all little enough to keep us above water.</P>
<P>The 13th of Augu&s;t, at 10 in the morning, the Glouce&s;ter made a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s, and, being to windward, bore down towards us; but we ob&s;erved &s;he was long in wearing, rolled very much, and made bad &s;teerage. About half an hour after noon they &s;poke with us, and told us that they were &s;o leaky that they mu&s;t quit their &s;hip; that they had &s;even feet water in the hold;
<PB N="368" REF="379">
and that all the men they had capable of &s;tirring were quite exhau&s;ted with pumping, and could work no longer. This was an additional mis|fortune, and &s;eemed to be without re&s;ource; for, whil&s;t the Glouce&s;ter's crew were thus enfeebled, our own &s;ick were now &s;o much increa&s;ed, and tho&s;e who &s;till remained in health, &s;o over-fa|tigued with labour, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to lend them any aid: all, therefore, that could be done was to &s;end our boat on board for a more particular account of the &s;hip's condition; as it was &s;oon &s;u&s;pected, that the taking her people on board us, and then de&s;troying the Glouce&s;|ter, was the only mea&s;ure that could be pro&s;e|cuted in the pre&s;ent emergency both for the pre&s;ervation of their lives and of our own.</P>
<P>Our boat &s;oon returned with a repre&s;entation of the melancholy &s;tate of the Glouce&s;ter, and of her &s;everal defects, &s;igned by Capt. Mitchell and all his officers; by which it appeared, that the &s;hip was decayed in every part; that her crew was greatly reduced; that there remained alive no more than 77 men, officers included, 18 boys, and two pri&s;oners; that of the whole number, only 16 men and 11 boys were capable of keeping the deck, and &s;everal of the&s;e very infirm; that the water was &s;o deep in the hold, that tho&s;e who were yet alive were &s;tarving, and could neither come at fre&s;h water nor provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>From this repre&s;entation, which was in no one in&s;tance exaggerated, the Commodore &s;ent im|mediately
<PB N="369" REF="380">
an order to Capt. Mitchell, to bring his people on board the Centurion, and to take out &s;uch &s;tores as could mo&s;t ea&s;ily be come at, among which he was very de&s;irous of &s;aving two cables, and a &s;heet anchor; but the &s;hip rolled &s;o much, and the men were &s;o exce&s;&s;ively fatigued, that it was with the greate&s;t difficulty the prize-money was &s;ecured, (the prize-goods amounting to many thou&s;and pounds being abandoned): nor could any other provi&s;ions be got at, than five ca&s;ks of flour, (three of which were &s;poiled by the &s;alt-water), a &s;mall quantity of brandy, and &s;ome living &s;tock. Even this little bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;o langui&s;hingly performed, that two days were wa&s;ted in the execution, during which time three or four of the &s;ick peri&s;hed on being removed.</P>
<P>As the weather was now calm, and we were uncertain how far di&s;tant we might be from Guam, a &s;ettlement in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy, to whom the wreck of &s;uch a &s;hip with guns and ammunition on board would have been a very valuable acqui&s;ition, the Commodore judg|ed the mo&s;t effectual way to prevent her from falling into their hands was to &s;et her on fire: and accordingly, as &s;oon as the Captain and his Offi|cers had quitted her, the combu&s;tibles placed for that purpo&s;e were lighted, and &s;he continu|ed burning the whole night, and at &s;ix the next morning &s;he blew up. Thus peri&s;hed his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;hip the Glouce&s;ter; and now, it might have been expected, that, being freed from
<PB N="370" REF="381">
the embarra&s;&s;ment in which her frequent di&s;a&s;|ters had involved us, we &s;hould have proceeded on our way much bri&s;ker than we had hitherto done. However, we were &s;oon taught, that our anxieties were not yet to be relieved.</P>
<P>We were at this time in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; the &s;hip con&s;iderably lumbered with prize-goods, and the &s;mall room we had left thronged with the &s;ick, who&s;e numbers were now very much increa&s;ed with tho&s;e from the Glouce&s;ter; the dirt, nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;tench, almo&s;t every where intolerable; more people daily di&s;abled with the di&s;ea&s;e; no &s;ign of land, nor but very little wind, and that not fair but variable; very bad provi&s;ions and water, and the &s;hip very leaky; and, though we di&s;covered the leak to be in her bows on each &s;ide the &s;tern, it lay in &s;uch a manner that we could not &s;top it, nay the attempting it rather made it wor&s;e. In this di&s;tre&s;s we made the be&s;t of every little &s;purt of wind.</P>
<P>Nothing farther remarkable happened till Sunday the 22d, when, about eight in the even|ing, we di&s;covered two i&s;lands, one bearing W. half S. and the other S. W. by W. at the di&s;|tance of about 10 leagues. We were overjoyed at this &s;ight, and &s;tood toward them with all our &s;ail; but, there being little wind, we did not get near them till the next day about noon, when being about three miles off the large&s;t and mo&s;t promi&s;ing of them, which appeared very hilly and full of trees, we &s;ent on &s;hore one of our Lieutenants in the cutter to make di&s;coveries,
<PB N="371" REF="382">
who returned at nine in the evening, and gave us but a very indifferent account of the &s;hore. The trees were mo&s;tly cocoa-nut-trees, of which there were prodigious quantities; about 60 co|coa nuts they brought on board with them, but they could find no water, nor any good place to anchor in: on this account it was thought fit to &s;tand further to the &s;outhward, for &s;ome more proper place. This was a &s;evere di&s;appointment to mo&s;t of the &s;ick, who, on the &s;ight of land, (or hearing that we were &s;o near it) had begun &s;en&s;ibly to revive: but as per&s;ons in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances are &s;oon driven to de&s;pond, when an aid they had depended upon de&s;erts them, &s;o this di&s;appointment de&s;troyed our hopes, and increa&s;ed our dejection. We feared, that, if we met with more i&s;lands in the &s;ame run, they might be either as bad, wor&s;e, or inhabited by our enemies the Spaniards, who, in our weak condition, might ea&s;ily be able to hinder us from proper refre&s;hments: add to this, how near ma|ny of us were to death, and how little we could expect to &s;urvive any time in &s;earching for other i&s;lands. I know not whether the&s;e were the ge|neral thoughts of the &s;ick, but I mu&s;t own they were mine, and made our &s;ituation at that time appear ten times wor&s;e to me than at any other in the whole cour&s;e of our voyage. I was indeed very ill, and my illne&s;s might po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion every thing to appear in its wor&s;t light, yet I never was one of tho&s;e who were frightened at the apprehen&s;ion, or even the vi&s;ible approach

of death; it had no unrea&s;onable terrors in any of its pro&s;pects to me; and I always could, and I hope always &s;hall be ready to meet it with calmne&s;s and perfect re&s;ignation: but I believe the healthie&s;t and &s;toute&s;t at that time had pro|bably the greate&s;t apprehen&s;ions; and I have &s;ince heard it from many of tho&s;e, that they ex|pected all to have peri&s;hed, had we been &s;o little as three weeks longer at &s;ea; and I much que&s;|tion whether they were not right in that expec|tation.</P>
<P>On the 26th, at five in the morning, we &s;aw three other i&s;lands, bearing from S. E. by S. to N. E. the middlemo&s;t of the three, which was the large&s;t, due E.</P>
<P>The 27th, at three in the afternoon, being got pretty near the &s;hore of the middlemo&s;t i&s;land, we &s;ent our cutter and pinnace in-&s;hore for di&s;covery. At four the pinnace came off, and brought with her an Indian paroo, with a Spaniard and four Indians, whom they took in her. They likewi&s;e told us, that they had in|&s;hore a &s;mall bark of about 16 tons, and between 20 and 30 more people on the i&s;land, all of whom had been &s;ent there from Guam to kill cattle and hogs, and make jerked beef and cocoa-nut-oil, &amp;c. for the Spani&s;h garri&s;on there; and that there are con&s;tantly people &s;ent on that account, who, after &s;ome months &s;tay at that place, are relieved by fre&s;h parties for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. We &s;ecured both bark and paroo, together with all the Indians who fell into our hands, to hin|der
<PB N="373" REF="384">
their carrying intelligence of us to the Spa|niards at Guam. One of tho&s;e Indians was a carpenter by trade, and his father was one of the principal builders at Manilla. This young man, having been ill u&s;ed by the Governor at Guam, voluntarily entered with us, and became one of our carpenter's crew, and proved a very u&s;eful handy fellow.</P>
<P>The Spaniard being examined as to the &s;tate of the i&s;land we were now approaching, the ac|count he gave &s;urpa&s;&s;ed even our mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes; and, tho' uninhabited, he &s;aid, it wanted none of tho&s;e accommodations with which the be&s;t cultivated countries are furni&s;hed. On mu&s;|tering up our whole force, as we drew near, all the hands we could collect capable of any kind of duty, even on the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions, amounted to no more than 71 men, officers in|cluded. This number, incon&s;iderable as it may &s;eem, were all of the united crews of the Cen|turion, Glouce&s;ter, and Trial, that could move without being a&s;&s;i&s;ted, notwith&s;tanding that, when we left England, they con&s;i&s;ted of near 1000 men.</P>
<P>When we had entered the road, our fir&s;t bu|&s;ine&s;s, after furling the &s;ails and &s;ecuring the &s;hip, was to provide an ho&s;pital on &s;hore for the &s;ick; but the officer and &s;eamen who were &s;ent upon this &s;ervice, returned joyfully, and acquainted us, that the Indians on &s;hore had &s;av|ed them that trouble, and had provided for us better than we could have done for our&s;elves;
<PB N="374" REF="385">
for, having erected a number of little cabbins for their accommodation during their re&s;idence on the i&s;land, and one in particular, which they made u&s;e of by way of &s;torehou&s;e to &s;tow their provi&s;ions in, there could be nothing more &s;uit|ably adapted for the reception both of the &s;ick and the healthy than the&s;e erections. Accord|ingly, we in&s;tantly began &s;ending a&s;hore as many of the &s;ick as could po&s;&s;ibly be conveyed, among which number I my&s;elf was one; I &s;ay, as many as could po&s;&s;ibly be conveyed, for we were all &s;o extremely feeble and helple&s;s, that we were no otherwi&s;e to be landed than by being carried in our hammocks, both in and out of the boats, on mens &s;houlders, in which &s;ervice both the Commodore him&s;elf and his officers very hu|manely a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and, indeed, they were almo&s;t the only per&s;ons on board capable of perform|ing it; the healthie&s;t &s;eamen being &s;o much en|feebled, that they had but ju&s;t &s;trength enough left to help them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The next day, being the 29th, the remainder of the &s;ick were brought on &s;hore, of whom 21 men died; but the greate&s;t part of the re&s;t re|covered &s;urprizingly. As &s;oon as I was ca|pable of &s;tirring about, I found the i&s;land to lie in lat. 14 deg. 58 min. N. [Walters &s;ays 15 deg. 8 min.] and in long. 223 deg. 35 min. W. from London, being, according to my reckoning, 117 deg. 7 min W. from Acapulco. [Walters &s;ays 114 deg. 50 min.] And here it is ob&s;erv|able, how writers of the fir&s;t characters for ve|racity
<PB N="375" REF="386">
differ in their accounts of the &s;ame places, by writing them at different periods. The de|&s;cription of this i&s;land of Tinian by Commodore Byron, who lately vi&s;ited it in his voyage round the world, bears no &s;imilitude to that we are now about to recite; nor can any one conceive how an interval of only 30 years could occa&s;ion &s;o remarkable an alteration. But to proceed:</P>
<P>The &s;oil, upon examination, we found to be every where dry and healthy; and being withal &s;omewhat &s;andy, it was thereby the le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to a rank and over-luxuriant vegetation: and hence the meadows and woods were neater and &s;moother than is u&s;ual in hot climates. The vallies and hills were mo&s;t beautifully diver&s;i|fied by the mutual encroachments of woods and lawns, which &s;kirted each other, and traver&s;ed the i&s;land in large tracts. The woods con&s;i&s;ted of tall and well-&s;pread trees, &s;ome celebrated for their beauty, and &s;ome for their fruit; whil&s;t the lawns were generally crouded with herds of cattle, of which it was not uncommon to &s;ee thou&s;ands feeding in a herd, and, being all milk-white, it is no wonder that &s;uch an appearance excited our longings, and increa&s;ed our impa|tience, to kill and eat. Add to the&s;e, the innu|merable &s;warms of poultry that crouded the woods, and, by their frequent crowings, gave us in idea the plea&s;ing apprehen&s;ion of being in the neighbourhood of farms and villages; and we even fancied, that in the covert of the woods
<PB N="376" REF="387">
we &s;hould find &s;uch concealed. The cattle we had &s;ight of were computed at 10,000; and, be&s;ides the&s;e and the poultry, we likewi&s;e found abundance of wild hogs, which were excellent food, but fierce, and not ea&s;ily ma&s;tered. At fir&s;t we killed them by &s;hooting; but, our am|munition failing, owing to an accident, we at la&s;t hunted them down with dogs, &s;everal of which joined us on the i&s;land, and, being train|ed to the &s;port by the Indians, readily enough followed us, and afforded us good diver&s;ion. In their conflicts with the boars, &s;ome indeed were killed; but tho&s;e that came off victorious, were &s;till more eager to engage in every new pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was no le&s;s fortunate to us in its vegetable than in its animal productions; more particularly abounding in &s;uch fruits and plants as were be&s;t adapted to the cure of that di&s;ea&s;e by which we had been &s;o dreadfully debilitated. In the woods cocoa nuts were to be gathered without number; and, what is remarkable, cab|bages grew on the &s;ame trees. There were, be|&s;ides, guavas, limes, &s;weet and &s;our oranges, and, what is common to all the Tropical i&s;lands, bread-fruit. In the plains we found water melons, dandelion, creeping-pur&s;lain, mint, &s;curvy-gra&s;s, and &s;orrel; all which, together with the fre&s;h-meats of the place, were &s;uch &s;alutary refre&s;h|ments, that the &s;ick, who were at death's-door when they landed, before they had been a week on &s;hore, put on very different countenances,
<PB N="377" REF="388">
and with their new complexions received a fre&s;h recruit of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t &s;uch a variety of provi&s;ions as the land furni&s;hed, it was thought unnece&s;&s;ary to in|dulge our&s;elves in tho&s;e offered us by the &s;ea. From fi&s;h, therefore, we wholly refrained; and the rather, as &s;ome we caught at our fir&s;t arrival &s;urfeited tho&s;e who eat of them. This, how|ever, was not regretted, as beef, pork, poultry, and wild-fowl, were in &s;uch plenty, that, except the trouble of bringing them from a con&s;ide|able di&s;tance &s;ometimes, there was no dif|ficulty attending their procurement. It were, indeed, an endle&s;s ta&s;k to recount all the excel|lencies and delicacies we met with in this de|lightful i&s;land: nor is it ea&s;y to &s;ay which to prefer where every thing is worthy of admira|tion; the neatne&s;s of its lawns, the &s;tateline&s;s, fre&s;hne&s;s, and fragrance of its woods, the happy inequality of its &s;urface, and the variety and ele|gance of the views it afforded,&mdash;all the&s;e con&s;pir|ed to charm the &s;ight, while at the &s;ame time the excellency of its productions could not fail to gratify the appetite. And the&s;e advantages were greatly enhanced by the healthine&s;s of the climate, by the almo&s;t con&s;tant cool breezes that prevailed, and by the frequent gentle &s;howers that &s;eemed to fall ju&s;t to refre&s;h the earth, and add to its fertility; for the&s;e, in&s;tead of the long-continued rains that in other countries fill the air with noxious vapours, and overflow the earth with wa&s;teful inundations, &s;eemed ju&s;t enough
<PB N="378" REF="389">
to purify the air, and to refre&s;h the &s;oil; which was ob&s;ervable enough by the effect it had in increa&s;ing our appetites, and promoting our di|ge&s;tion. This effect was, indeed, remarkable, &s;ince tho&s;e among&s;t our officers, who were at all other times &s;pare and temperate eaters, were here in appearance transformed into gluttons; for in&s;tead of one rea&s;onable fle&s;h-meal a day, they were &s;carcely &s;atisfied with three: and yet our dige&s;tion &s;o well corre&s;ponded to the keen|ne&s;s of our appetites, that we were neither di&s;|ordered nor even loaded by this uncommon re|pletion; for, after having made a large beef breakfa&s;t, it was not long before we began to con&s;ider the approach of dinner as a very de&s;ire|able, and even &s;omewhat tardy event.</P>
<P>The principal inconveniences that attended our re&s;idence upon this i&s;land aro&s;e from the va&s;t number of mu&s;ketos and other trouble&s;ome flies, by which we were perpetually teized; there was likewi&s;e a venomous little in&s;ect, that, like the &s;heep-ticks in England, would bury its head in the &s;kin, and, if not in&s;tantly removed, would cau&s;e an inflammation.</P>
<P>Running water there was none in the i&s;land; but that defect was &s;upplied by a large lake, or lagoon, almo&s;t in the center of it, to which the cattle, in times of drought, generally re&s;orted; but the fre&s;hne&s;s of their pa&s;ture, and the co|pious dews and gentle &s;howers that often moi&s;t|ened it, rendered that re&s;ource almo&s;t unnece&s;|&s;ary. There were, be&s;ides, &s;prings of excellent
<PB N="379" REF="390">
water, and near the &s;urface wells might every where be dug, who&s;e waters, in any other place, would not have been complained of.</P>
<P>But the great danger we had to dread remains to be told. During four months in the year, that is, from the middle of June to the middle of October, when the we&s;tern mon&s;oons pre|vail, the winds, about the full and change of the moon, are variable, and blow with &s;uch fury, that the &s;toute&s;t cables afford no &s;ecurity to &s;hips riding at anchor in the road: and what adds to the danger is the rapidity of the tide, which &s;ets to the S. E. and occa&s;ions &s;uch a hollow and over-grown &s;ea as is not to be con|ceived; in&s;omuch that, though we were in a &s;ixty-gun &s;hip, we were under the dreadful ap|prehen&s;ion of being pooped by it. During the re&s;t of the year the weather is con&s;tantly &s;ettled, and &s;hips have nothing to fear, if their cables are well armed, which otherwi&s;e will &s;uffer from the foulne&s;s of the ground.</P>
<P>From the 29th of Augu&s;t, when our &s;ick were all put on &s;hore, to the 12th of Septem|ber, when the Commodore him&s;elf landed, tho&s;e who remained on board were chiefly em|ployed in mooring and &s;ecuring the &s;hip, in &s;hifting her guns to come at her leaks, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ackling the cables, to prevent their being gall|ed by the friction again&s;t the rocky bottom. At the &s;ame time an anchor and cable were put on board the Spani&s;h bark, her own being on|ly a heavy log of wood, and a rope made of
<PB N="380" REF="391">
ba&s;s; and &s;ome barrels of powder to be dried and recovered, which by long keeping was become moi&s;t.</P>
<P>From the 12th to the 18th, the hands were continually &s;hifting, tho&s;e who were &s;o well re|covered as to be capable of duty were &s;ent on board, and tho&s;e who had born the burden of the labour were relieved and &s;ent on &s;hore.</P>
<P>On the 19th, the weather began to alter, and to threaten a &s;torm: on that day, the next, and the 21&s;t, it blew hard; however, we rode it out, and flattered our&s;elves that the prudence of our mea&s;ures had &s;ecured us from accidents, On the 22d, the hurricane came on, and our only hope of &s;afety &s;eemed to depend on our putting out to &s;ea; but the Commodore was on &s;hore, and all communication with the land ab|&s;olutely cut off. At five in the afternoon, the &s;mall bower parted, and the &s;hip &s;prung off to the be&s;t bower. As night approached, the violence of the &s;torm increa&s;ed; yet, not|with&s;tanding its inexpre&s;&s;ible fury, the rapidity of the tide was &s;uch as to prevail over it, and to force the &s;hip before it, as it were, in de&s;pight of its utmo&s;t rage. It was now that the &s;ea broke all round us in a mo&s;t tremendous manner; and that a large tumbling &s;well threatened to ingulph us in its bo&s;om: the long-boat, which was moored a &s;tern, was on a &s;udden canted &s;o high that it broke the tran&s;um of the Commo|dore's gallery, and would, doubtle&s;s, have ri&s;en as high as the tafferel, had it not been for the
<PB N="381" REF="392">
&s;troke, which &s;tove the boat to pieces; but yet the poor boat-keeper, though much brui&s;ed, was &s;aved almo&s;t by miracle. About eight, the tide &s;lackened; but, the wind not abating, the the be&s;t bower cable, by which alone we rode, parted at eleven. In this extremity, Mr. Sau|marez, our Fir&s;t Lieutenant, who commanded in the ab&s;ence of the Commodore, ordered guns to be fired, and lights to be &s;hewn, as &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s; and, in a &s;hort time after, the night being exce&s;&s;ively dark, the &s;torm raging, the thunder roaring, and nothing to be &s;een but the blue lightning fla&s;hing through the rain, we were driven to &s;ea, and, by this cata&s;trophe, the whole crew, both by &s;ea and land, reduced to a &s;tate of de&s;pair; tho&s;e on &s;hore concluding they had now no means left them ever to get home; whil&s;t tho&s;e on board, being utterly un|prepared to &s;truggle with the fury of &s;uch &s;eas and winds, expected each moment to be their la&s;t. In this &s;tate of de&s;pondency, while tho&s;e on board were every moment in expectation of being da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks of Aiguigan, an i&s;land at about three leagues from Tinian, tho&s;e on &s;hore were per&s;uaded the &s;hip could not &s;ur|vive the &s;torm, the whole channel between the two i&s;lands appearing from the land like one continued breach, the &s;ea &s;welling, breaking, and roaring, like mountains rolling over moun|tains, and forming the mo&s;t awful and terrify|ing &s;ight that the mind of man can po&s;&s;ibly conceive. Indeed, the condition of tho&s;e on
<PB N="382" REF="393">
board was truly pitiable; they were in a leaky &s;hip, with three cables in their haw&s;es, to one of which hung their only remaining anchor; they had not a gun on board la&s;hed; nor a port barred in; their &s;hrouds were loo&s;e; and their fore top-ma&s;t unrigged; and they had &s;truck their fore and main yards down before the hur|ricane came on, &s;o that there was no &s;ail they could &s;et except the mizzen: to add to their misfortunes, they were no &s;ooner at &s;ea, than, by the labouring of the &s;hip, whole floods of water ru&s;hed in through the haw&s;e-holes, ports, and &s;cuppers; which, with the u&s;ual leakage, kept the pumps con&s;tantly at work. Per&s;uaded that their de&s;truction was inevitable, &s;inking, however, was only their &s;econdary concern; they judged, by the driving of the &s;hip, that they were making towards the land, and that, in the darkne&s;s of the night, they &s;hould no otherwi&s;e perceive it than by &s;triking upon it; but day|light relieved them from that unea&s;y appre|hen&s;ions, and &s;hewed them that the i&s;land they &s;o much dreaded was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and that a &s;trong northern current had proved the means of their pre&s;ervation. It was not, however, till after three days that the turbulent weather that had driven them from Tinian be|gan to abate; when every man in the &s;hip was &s;o worn out with fatigue, that they found it im|po&s;&s;ible to man the pumps, and hand the &s;ails at the &s;ame time. They had twice attempted to heave up the main and fore yards, in which
<PB N="383" REF="394">
they had as often mi&s;carried by the breaking of the jeers, and in the la&s;t effort one of their be&s;t men peri&s;hed. During all this time the &s;hip was driving to leeward, and dragging her &s;heet anchor, the only one &s;he had left, with two cables an end at her bows. This was a circum|&s;tance of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, and required a &s;peedy remedy; for, though upon a third exertion of their whole force, they had replaced their yards, they dur&s;t not, while the anchor continued in that &s;ituation, venture to &s;pread their canvas. Some re&s;t and refre&s;hment be|came nece&s;&s;ary before a work of &s;uch labour could be propo&s;ed to a feeble and dimini&s;hed crew, who hardly con&s;i&s;ted of 100 men: It was, therefore, five days after their departure be|fore they could &s;ecure their anchor; and now they &s;et their cour&s;es, and, for the fir&s;t time, &s;tood to the ea&s;tward, in hopes of &s;oon regain|ing the i&s;land, and rejoining their Commander and the re&s;t of their company: but in this they were unhappily di&s;appointed; for having run, as they thought, the di&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary for making the i&s;land, and being in full expec|tation of &s;eeing it, they found them&s;elves be|wildered by the irregularity of the currents, and knew not what cour&s;e to &s;teer, till, after &s;everal days uncertainty, they came at la&s;t in &s;ight of Guam, from whence they directed their cour&s;e with infinite labour to Tinian, the wind being con&s;tantly again&s;t them, and the tide variable. This &s;evere employment held till the 11th of
<PB N="384" REF="395">
October, when, after nineteen days ab&s;ence, they appeared again in the offing, and were rein|forced from the &s;hore, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the whole crew.</P>
<P>A few days after the &s;hip was driven off, &s;ome of the people on &s;hore cried out, <HI>A &s;ail!</HI> and this &s;pread a general joy, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the Centurion returning; but pre&s;ently a &s;econd &s;ail was de&s;cried, which wholly de&s;troyed the fir&s;t conjecture, and made it difficult to gue&s;s who they were. The Commodore turning his gla&s;s towards them, &s;aw they were two boats; and in&s;tantly concluding that the Centurion was gone to the bottom, and that tho&s;e were her boats returning with the remains of her people, this &s;udden &s;ugge&s;tion wrought &s;o pow|erfully upon him, that, to conceal his emo|tion, he was obliged to retire to his tent, where he pa&s;t &s;ome bitter moments in the firm per&s;ua|&s;ion that all his hopes were now at an end, and that, in&s;tead of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the enemy, he mu&s;t him&s;elf with his people fall a prey to their re|lentle&s;s cruelty. He was, however, &s;oon re|lieved from this mortifying thought, they ap|pearing, upon their nearer approach, to be In|dian proas, directing their cour&s;e towards the bay, with a view, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, to relieve their countrymen, or to take on board their provi&s;ions. On this intelligence, the Commo|dore ordered his people to conceal them&s;elves; but the proas, after advancing within a quarter of a mile of the &s;hore, lay by for the &s;pace of
<PB N="385" REF="396">
a few hours, and probably ob&s;erving &s;ome change in the appearance of the place, which might rai&s;e their &s;u&s;picion that an enemy lay in ambu&s;h, they got again under &s;ail, and &s;teered to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>After this incident an opinion began gene|rally to prevail, that the Centurion would never more appear at this i&s;land; and that &s;he was either lo&s;t, or forced upon the coa&s;t of China, from whence, in her crazy condition, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for her ever to return. Though the Commodore did not apparently give into this opinion, yet he was not without his fears; and, therefore, to provide again&s;t the wor&s;t, he propo&s;ed cutting a&s;under the Indian bark which they took on their fir&s;t arrival, and lengthening her in &s;uch a manner as to be capable of taking on board all who were then upon the i&s;land, and following the &s;hip, if peradventure &s;he &s;hould be driven to Mocao. After &s;ome he&s;itation, owing to the difficulty attending the execution, the men were at length prevailed upon to engage in the work, and the Commodore by his example en|couraged their diligence; for, being always at work by day-break him&s;elf, it was thought a di&s;grace to be idle when their Chief was employ|ed. It fortunately happened, that the Carpen|ters both of the Glouce&s;ter and Trial were on &s;hore, and that they had brought for &s;afety their che&s;ts of tools with them. The &s;mith, too, was on &s;hore with his forge, but his bellows was &s;till in the &s;hip. This defect occa&s;ioned &s;ome
<PB N="386" REF="397">
delay; but was &s;oon &s;upplied by the ingenuity of his &s;hip-mates, one or other of them never be|ing at a lo&s;s for expedients on &s;uch occa&s;ions: they limed a fre&s;h hide for leather, the carpen|ters &s;haped out a wooden frame, and a gun bar|rel &s;erved for a nozel. The &s;mith being now in readine&s;s to prepare the iron-work, &s;ome were employed in cutting down trees, nnd &s;aw|ing them into plank, whil&s;t the main-body were bu&s;ied in digging out a draw-dock to receive the bark, and in laying of ways to heave her up and down. All, in &s;hort, were variou&s;ly employed; and the work went on &s;ucce&s;sfully for 16 days, in which time the bark was &s;awn a&s;under, her two parts &s;eparated, and placed at the proper di&s;tance from each other; and, the materials be|ing all in readine&s;s before-hand, they proceeded with no &s;mall di&s;patch in the enlargement, in&s;o|much that they fixed the 5th of November as the day when they &s;hould be ready to depart. The alacrity with which this bu&s;ine&s;s was carried on, left no room for reflection among the common &s;ailors, though their &s;uperiors were not without their fears. They had no &s;ea-provi&s;ions, except &s;ome jerked beef, which the Indians had pre|pared and abandoned when they fled, and they had a run of 600 leagues before they could pre|&s;ume upon a &s;upply; they had no bread, and the bread fruit on the i&s;land could not be pre|&s;erved at &s;ea; they wanted &s;alt; and, what was &s;till a more nece&s;&s;ary article in their pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation, they wanted ammunition for their defence,

in ca&s;e of an attack from the enemy; for, upon the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch, no more than 90 charges of powder could be collected, which was &s;hort of one round a-piece for each of the company; they were, too, in an unknown &s;ea, and wanted in&s;truments to direct their cour&s;e: in &s;hort, though the common men had no other thought but how they &s;hould get on board, the officers fore&s;aw a thou&s;and difficulties, which were al|mo&s;t in&s;urmountable to human apprehen&s;ion, but which they carefully concealed, that the main bu&s;ine&s;s might not be retarded.</P>
<P>But, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e gloomy apprehen|&s;ions, which, the nearer the time of their de|parture approached, &s;till became the more &s;erious, and when all hope of &s;eeing the Cen|turion at Tinian had &s;ub&s;ided, one of the Glouce&s;ter's men, being upon a hill at a di&s;|tance looking out for cattle, perceived, as he fancied, &s;omething like a &s;hip in the clouds, which, on &s;teadily ob&s;erving it, &s;eemed to move &s;lowly towards the land. It was not long be|fore he was &s;en&s;ible of its approach, and per|&s;uading him&s;elf it was the Centurion, he in an extacy ran towards the landing-place, crying to his comrades, <HI>The &s;hip! The &s;hip!</HI> This being heard by the neare&s;t, was echoed from mouth to mouth till it reached the &s;pot where the Commodore was at work, who, on hearing the joyful news, threw down his axe, and joined in the general tran&s;port. In a few hours the Cen|turion appeared in the offing, and a boat with
<PB N="388" REF="399">
18 men was &s;ent off to reinforce her, and to carry fre&s;h meats, fruits, and refre&s;hments, for the crew. In the afternoon of the 11th of October &s;he happily ca&s;t anchor, the Commo|dore went in&s;tantly aboard, and the joy and congratulations on that occa&s;ion were equally &s;incere and mutual.</P>
<P>The labour of the artificers was now at an end, and another kind of employment &s;ucceeded, which was that of laying in water for the re|mainder of the voyage. Now al&s;o hunting, &s;houting, &s;etting, and every device that could be contrived to catch live cattle, hogs, and poul|try, for &s;tores, took, place; while, at the &s;ame time, the Commodore and Officers amu&s;ed them|&s;elves with traver&s;ing the i&s;land, and examining more minutely its &s;everal parts. In one of the&s;e excur&s;ions, being on a ri&s;ing ground, they ob|&s;erved, in a valley beneath them, the appear|ance of a &s;mall thicket, which, by attending to it, &s;eemed to have a progre&s;&s;ive motion, as in|deed it had; but was no other than a parcel of cocoa-bu&s;hes trailed upon the ground by per|&s;ons concealed beneath them. From this un|common circum&s;tance, it was immediately con|cluded, that the Indians, who&s;e boat they had &s;urprized upon their fir&s;t arrival, mu&s;t be the per&s;ons who were dragging the bu&s;hes, and that it could not be far to the place of their con|cealment; they therefore kept their eye upon them, and traced them to their cell; but, to their &s;urprize, when they came to enter it, they
<PB N="389" REF="400">
found it abandoned, though all things were rea|dy prepared for dinner, and &s;tood &s;moaking hot on a table of turf. The officers, having in vain endeavoured to track them, returned, and, with an appetite increa&s;ed by the keenne&s;s of the pur&s;uit, &s;at down to that meal which the poor hungry &s;avages had abandoned. It con&s;i&s;ted of &s;alted &s;pareribs, cocoa-nuts, and bread fruit; all which they found ready dre&s;t, and in quan|tity as much as they all could eat.</P>
<P>On the third day after the &s;econd arrival of the &s;hip, the Commodore being on board, a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind aro&s;e, and again brought home our anchor, and drove us out to &s;ea. Our chief officers were now all on board; and only about 70 of our men, with a mid&s;hipman or two to command them, were employed on &s;hore in filling water and catching cattle. Of the&s;e about 30 came off to us in the cutter, and the eighteen-oared barge was &s;ent for the re&s;t; but they not being in readine&s;s, and the &s;hip quickly driving out of &s;ight, it was no longer in their power to join us. However, as the weather &s;oon proved favourable, and we were now &s;tronger and healthier than at our fir&s;t di|&s;a&s;ter, in about five days we regained the road, and anchored &s;afe in our former &s;tation. On our return we found the Spani&s;h bark re&s;tored to her old dimen&s;ions, and the parts brought together, and in good forwardne&s;s to be com|pleated; for the few remaining people, de&s;pair|ing of the return of the &s;hip, had determined
<PB N="390" REF="401">
to follow her to her de&s;tined port. We now laboured indefatigably to get in our water, in order to &s;ail, in which &s;ervice two of our men employed in the well unfortunately peri&s;hed; for the &s;ides of the well being loo&s;e earth, by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e above, in not properly attending the filling, the bank gave way by the weight of a heavy ca&s;k, and both that and the bank fell in upon them together. Some other misfortunes happened through ha&s;te in rafting the ca&s;ks to the &s;hip; yet, notwith&s;tanding, be|ing &s;uch as are generally accounted trifling on board a man of war, our watering went on &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that by the 20th of October it was compleated; and on that day leave was given for a man from each me&s;s to go a&s;hore, and gather as many oranges, lemons, cocoa-nuts, and other fruits of the i&s;land, as &s;hould be &s;ufficient for us all while at &s;ea. This being accompli&s;hed, the Spani&s;h bark &s;et on fire, the men returned on board, and the boats hoi&s;ted in, on the 21&s;t we &s;et &s;ail; and the wind being fair, and the weather mode|rate, nothing remarkable happened till we ar|rived on the coa&s;ts of China, except that while we were pa&s;&s;ing by the rocks of Vele Rete, near the &s;outh end of the i&s;land Formo&s;a, we were alarmed by a cry of fire on the foreca&s;tle, which brought the whole crew together in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, &s;o that it was difficult for &s;ome time to reduce them to order; but, as &s;oon as di&s;cipline took place, and a proper exa|mination
<PB N="391" REF="402">
could be made, it was found to pro|ceed from the furnace, where the bricks, being over-heated, had begun to communicate the fire to the wood-work, which, had it not been timely di&s;covered, might have been of the mo&s;t dread|ful con&s;equence; but, as it fell out, it was extin|gui&s;hed with the greate&s;t facility, and the brick|work &s;o &s;ecured, that no accident of the like kind could again happen.</P>
<P>From the i&s;land of Formo&s;a we directed our cour&s;e &s;o as to fall in with the coa&s;t of China, to the ea&s;tward of Pedro Blanco, as that rock is generally e&s;teemed the be&s;t direction for &s;hips bound to Mocao; and, on the 6th of Novem|ber we fell in with it, when we were pre&s;ently &s;urrounded by an incredible number of fi&s;hing-boats, which covered the &s;urface of the &s;ea as far as the eye could reach. Nor was this &s;warm of fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els peculiar to that place; for, as we ran on to the we&s;tward, we found them as abundant on every other part of the coa&s;t. From among the&s;e we had no &s;ort of doubt of procuring a pilot to Mocao; but, when we thought our&s;elves near it, though we tempted them with &s;hewing them bags of Spani&s;h dol|lars, for which, it is &s;aid, a Chine&s;e would &s;ell his father, yet not one of them would venture to come on board us, nor give us the lea&s;t in|telligence; neither did our &s;hip, the like of which, &s;o armed and fitted, had never before appeared upon their coa&s;ts, &s;eem to excite in them any curio&s;ity: they continued their fi&s;h|ing
<PB N="392" REF="403">
with the &s;ame apparent indifference as if any trading &s;hip had been pa&s;&s;ing by; and, when we made them &s;ignals, they di&s;regarded them as much, though they certainly under&s;tood them, as if we had been only in &s;port. The next day, however, about two in the afternoon, as we were &s;tanding to the we&s;tward within two leagues of the &s;hore, &s;till &s;urrounded as before, we ob&s;erved that a boat a-head of us waved a red flag, and blew a horn. This we apprehend|ed was a &s;ignal for us, and accordingly we hoi&s;t|ed out our cutter, and &s;ent to know the mean|ing of it; when we pre&s;ently di&s;covered our mi&s;take, and that it was only the u&s;ual notice to leave off fi&s;hing, which the whole fleet in&s;tantly obeyed. Being thus di&s;appointed, we kept on our crui&s;e till we came to a group of i&s;lands, round the we&s;ternmo&s;t of which we were direct|ed to pa&s;s, and then to haul up. While we were thus employed, a Chine&s;e pilot came on board, and in broken Portugue&s;e undertook to pilot us into harbour for 30 dollars, and on the 12th of November anchored us &s;afe in Mocao-road; where the fir&s;t thing we did was to &s;alute the fort, and to &s;end to the Portugue&s;e Gover|nor to advi&s;e with his Excellency in what man|ner to behave to avoid giving offence to the Chine&s;e. The difficulty the Commodore prin|cipally apprehended related to the port charges u&s;ually paid by &s;hips in the river Canton, from which charges men-of-war are exempted in every port of Europe, and which the Commodore was
<PB N="393" REF="404">
determined not to be forced to pay in this. In the evening the boat returned with two officers, who delivered it as the Governor's opinion, that, if the Centurion ventured into the river of Canton, the duty would mo&s;t certainly be expected; and, therefore, if the Commodore approved of it, he would &s;end a pilot to conduct the &s;hip into ano|ther harbour, called the Typa, where it was pro|bable the port charges would never be demand|ed. To this propo&s;al the Commodore agreed, the pilot was &s;ent, and the &s;hip &s;afely moored.</P>
<P>Next day the Commodore paid a vi&s;it in per|&s;on to the Governor, to &s;olicit a &s;upply of provi|&s;ions, and of naval &s;tores to refit the &s;hip. The Governor very frankly acquainted the Commo|dore, that he dur&s;t not openly furni&s;h either the one or the other; for that he him&s;elf nei|ther received provi&s;ions for his garri&s;on but from day to day, by permi&s;&s;ion from the Chine&s;e go|vernment, nor any thing el&s;e but what his pre|&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities required: however, he a&s;&s;ured the Commodore in a friendly manner, that he would give him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power. On this declaration, the Commodore determin|ed to go to Canton him&s;elf, to procure a licence from the Viceroy to purcha&s;e a &s;upply, and, with this view, hired a Chine&s;e boat for him&s;elf and his attendants to carry them into port: but ju&s;t as they were ready to embark, the Hoppo refu&s;ed to grant them a permit; nor would he, notwith&s;tanding all the intere&s;t the Com|modore could make, withdraw the prohibition,
<PB N="394" REF="405">
till he was threatened to be compelled to it by force. This operated when fair means had fail|ed; a permit was next day &s;ent on board, and the Commodore proceeded to the Engli&s;h fac|tory, to con&s;ult with the principal officers there about the cautions that were to be u&s;ed, le&s;t the factory &s;hould &s;uffer by violent mea&s;ures, which he was &s;olicitous to avoid. They advi&s;ed him to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s by the mediation of the Chine&s;e merchants, who at fir&s;t undertook to accompli&s;h it; but, after trifling with him more than a month, they declared they dur&s;t not interfere in it. The merchants then under|took to procure him provi&s;ions clande&s;tinely; but that would not &s;uffice. Upon his return, he found the &s;hip &s;o much out of repair, that &s;he could not proceed without being hove down; he, therefore, next day wrote a letter to the Viceroy, acquainting him, that he was Commo|dore of a &s;quadron of his Britannic Maje&s;ty's &s;hips that had been crui&s;ing in the South Seas again&s;t the Spaniards, who were at war with his nation; that his &s;hip was leaky; that his peo|ple were in want of provi&s;ions; that he had put into Mocao, a friendly port, for a &s;upply, but that, being a &s;tranger to the cu&s;toms of the country, he had been unable to &s;ucceed; and, therefore, reque&s;ted, that he might be permitted to employ workmen to repair his &s;hip, and that he might be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions at the ac|cu&s;tomed rates at which the articles he &s;tood in need of were generally &s;old. Another difficulty
<PB N="395" REF="406">
was now &s;tarted as to the delivery of this let|ter, the Hoppo at fir&s;t refu&s;ing to intermeddle with it; but, on the Commodore's expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome re&s;entment, and threatening to convey it to Canton by his own me&s;&s;engers, he at length undertook not only to deliver it, but to procure an an&s;wer: accordingly, though the letter was only dated on the 17th of December, on the 19th a Mandarine of the fir&s;t rank, together with two others of an inferior cla&s;s, and their attendants, having in their retinue 18 half gal|lies, decorated with &s;treamers, and furni&s;hed with bands of mu&s;ic, came to a grapple a-head of the Centurion, whence the Mandarine &s;ent in form to acquaint the Commodore, that he came by order of the Viceroy to examine the condition of the &s;hip, and to report the &s;ame as it &s;hould appear to him upon a ju&s;t &s;urvey. On this me&s;&s;age, preparations were in&s;tantly made to re|ceive him; in particular, a hundred of the mo&s;t &s;ightly men on board, uniformly dre&s;&s;ed in the regimentals of the marines, were drawn up un|der arms on the main-deck again&s;t his arrival. When he entered the &s;hip, he was &s;aluted by the drums and military mu&s;ic, and conducted by &s;ome of the principal officers to the quarter|deck, where he was received in &s;tate by the Commodore, and then introduced to the great cabbin, where he explained his commi&s;&s;ion, and pre&s;ented the per&s;ons he had brought with him to take the &s;urvey. The Mandarine appeared to be a per&s;on of &s;uperior abilities, and endowed
<PB N="396" REF="407">
with a frankne&s;s and hone&s;ty not u&s;ually to be met with among the ordinary ranks of Chine&s;e officers; and, being an eye-witne&s;s of the dangerous &s;tate of the leaks, and of the nece&s;&s;ity there was for a thorough repair, he expre&s;&s;ed his entire acqui|e&s;cence in the report that had been given, and promi&s;ed to lay the &s;ame immediately before the council upon his return. He was exceeding curious in in&s;pecting the &s;hip, in examining her guns, and poi&s;ing her great &s;hot. He ex|pre&s;t his a&s;toni&s;hment at her &s;trength and her magnitude; and the Commodore, to increa&s;e his wonder, and &s;hew his own power, let him know how ea&s;y it would be for him to de&s;troy the whole navigable force of China, and lay the city of Canton in ruins; but, neverthele&s;s, he a&s;&s;ured him, that not the lea&s;t violence &s;hould be offered, provided his wants were &s;upplied upon rea&s;onable terms.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Commodore complain|ed of the behaviour of the officers at Mocao, who had prohibited the country people from &s;elling provi&s;ions to his company, though they had paid for what they purcha&s;ed in &s;terling &s;ilver. The Mandarine heard the complaint without emotion, but &s;aid it &s;hould be remedied for the future. After the bu&s;ine&s;s was over, dinner was ordered, and the Commodore apolo|gi&s;ed for the meanne&s;s of the fare from the diffi|culty he had to procure better: but the two inferi|or Mandarines, who were the only per&s;ons of their retinue permitted to &s;it at table with them, &s;hew|ed
<PB N="397" REF="408">
no di&s;like to any thing &s;et before them, ex|cept the beef, to which they have the &s;ame di&s;|like as the Jews have to pork, from an early prejudice derived from their ance&s;tors; of this the Commodore was not apprized, nor were they offended at its being &s;et before them. They were, indeed, very aukward at the u&s;e of knives and forks, and it was found nece&s;&s;ary to intro|duce their own &s;ervants to carve for them, be|fore they could make an end of their dinners. But if they were deficient in their manner of eating, they were no novices in putting about the gla&s;&s;es; for there was not an officer at table that dur&s;t engage with them. Seeing they were fond of Frontiniac, and that they pre&s;ently emptied four or five bottles of it without any effect, the Commodore ordered a bottle of Ci|tron water to be brought up, which, on ta&s;ting, they liked, and, the Commodore excu&s;ing him|&s;elf on account of an illne&s;s he had not yet re|covered, they clapped a ruddy-faced officer on the &s;houlder, and de&s;ired him to pledge them, &s;aying, by their interpreter, they were &s;ure he could not plead illne&s;s for declining his gla&s;s. When the bottle was out, they all ro&s;e from table, without appearing to be in the lea&s;t di&s;or|dered, and, after the u&s;ual ceremonies, depart|ed, very well plea&s;ed with their entertainment.</P>
<P>The Commodore now impatiently expected the licence he had reque&s;ted; but it was &s;everal days before it pa&s;&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ary forms, chief|ly owing to the intrigues of a Frenchman, who,
<PB N="398" REF="409">
having the advantage of &s;peaking the language fluently, was at no lo&s;s in traver&s;ing the mea|&s;ures of the friendly Mandarine in favour of Mr. An&s;on; but a repetition of the threats already referred to, produced, at la&s;t, the de&s;ir|ed effect. On the 6th of January, the licence was received, and the carpenters were &s;et to work; but, previous to this, the prohibition was taken off, and provi&s;ions were every day brought to the &s;hip in plenty.</P>
<P>It was, however, the beginning of April be|fore the repairs could be compleated, and the Chine&s;e began to be very unea&s;y at their long &s;tay. They had frequently &s;ent me&s;&s;ages to the Commodore to ha&s;ten his departure, not know|ing or believing that he was no le&s;s in earne&s;t to be gone, than they were to be freed from the dread of his &s;tay. At length, on the 3d of April, two Mandarines came on board from Mocao, with a peremptory command addre&s;&s;|ed to the Commodore, requiring him to depart; to which he made an&s;wer, in a determined tone, that he would go when he thought proper, and not when they pre&s;umed to command him. After this rebuke, however, all communication was forbidden, and no more provi&s;ions were &s;uffered to go on board; and &s;o &s;trictly were tho&s;e injunctions carried into execution, that from thenceforwards nothing could be purcha&s;|ed at any rate whatever. On the 6th of April, the Centurion weighed, and warped to the &s;outhward; and, by the 15th, &s;he was &s;afe in
<PB N="399" REF="410">
Mocao road, having compleated her water as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along. On the 19th, &s;he again weigh|ed anchor, and put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>But long before this, that is, &s;ome time in November, Captain Saunders, Commander of the Tryal's prize, took pa&s;&s;age on board a Swedi&s;h &s;hip with di&s;patches from the Com|modore to the government. And &s;oon after, that is, about the middle of December, Cap|tain Mitchell, Col. Crackerode, Mr. Ta&s;well, with his nephew Mr. Charles Herriot, and the Rev. Mr. Walter, embarked on board the com|pany's &s;hips on their return home. About this time we received the fir&s;t news of the &s;afe ar|rival of the Severn and Pearl (the two &s;hips of our &s;quadron that parted from us in doubling Cape Horn) at Rio Janeiro, on the coa&s;t of Brazil. The Severn had been remarkable for the extraordinary &s;ickne&s;s that had been more fatal on board her than on board of any other in the whole &s;quadron, in&s;omuch that her hands had been twice recruited from the Cen|turion during her voyage to the &s;traits of Le Maire; and yet when &s;he parted company &s;he wanted hands to navigate her in a &s;torm, which was the rea&s;on of her return. It was from the knowledge of this uncommon mortality that prevailed among the crew, that the Commodore concluded the Severn to be lo&s;t. The news, therefore, of her and the Pearl's &s;afety was re|ceived with the greater plea&s;ure, as we had long
<PB N="400" REF="411">
entertained an opinion that both of them had peri&s;hed. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion:</P>
<P>From the 1&s;t to the 15th of April, we had &s;tormy weather, with heavy rains and &s;uch a|mazing and terrifying claps of thunder and fla&s;hes of lightning as nothing of the kind I had ever &s;een or heard bore any proportion to. This was upon the breaking-up of the ea&s;terly mon|&s;oon, when &s;uch &s;torms are u&s;ual in the coun|try, accompanied &s;ometimes with dreadful gu&s;ts of wind, called here by the name of Tuffoons, of the effects of which the Chine&s;e relate very wonderful &s;tories.</P>
<P>While we were warping out of the harbour, the Commodore went on &s;hore to Mocao, to take leave of the Portugue&s;e Governor, who had, to the utmo&s;t of his power, behaved in a very friendly manner; and, at his coming from the fort, he was &s;aluted with 15 guns.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay we had entered about 20 fre&s;h hands, being chiefly La&s;cars, Per&s;ians, and Dutchmen; &s;o that our whole complement, when we &s;ailed, amounted to 224 men and boys, among whom were &s;ome of all nations, languages, and religions.</P>
<P>Being now at &s;ea, we were &s;ome time in a &s;tate of uncertainty what cour&s;e the Commo|dore intended to &s;teer. He gave out at Mo|cao, that he was bound to Batavia, and thence to England; but his real de&s;ign was very dif|ferent. The project the Commodore had re|&s;olved upon in his own mind, was, to crui&s;e
<PB N="401" REF="412">
for the annual &s;hip from Acapulco to Manilla; and, not di&s;couraged by his former di&s;a&s;ters, he determined again to ri&s;que the ca&s;ualties of the Pacific Ocean, and to take his &s;tation off Cape Spirito Santo on the i&s;land of Jamal, being the fir&s;t land the Acapulco &s;hips always make in approaching the Philippines.</P>
<P>Being now at &s;ea, it was no longer nece&s;&s;ary to conceal this project; he, therefore, &s;um|moned all his people on the quarter-deck, and in a &s;hort, but &s;pirited &s;peech, informed them of his de&s;ign; which was received by them with the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive tokens of general approba|tion: and &s;uch a confidence of &s;ucceeding dif|fu&s;ed it&s;elf through all the &s;hip's company, that the Commodore, who had taken &s;ome Chine&s;e &s;heep to &s;ea with him for his own provi&s;ion, en|quiring one day of his butcher, why he had late|ly &s;een no mutton at his table? the man replied dryly, that in truth there were only two &s;heep left, and the&s;e, with his honour's leave, he pro|po&s;ed to re&s;erve for the entertainment of the General of the galleons.</P>
<P>When the Centurion left the port of Mocao, &s;he &s;tood for &s;ome days to the we&s;tward; and, on the fir&s;t of May, pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land of For|mo&s;a; and, &s;teering to the &s;outhward, on the 4th in the evening they came in &s;ight of the Ba&s;hee I&s;lands, which they &s;u&s;pected to be wrong laid down by Dampier, and from ob|&s;ervation found them 25 leagues too far to the we&s;tward. On the 20th of May, they came in
<PB N="402" REF="413">
&s;ight of E&s;pirito Santo. As it was known there were centinels placed upon the Cape to make &s;ignals to the Acapulco &s;hips, the Commodore immediately tacked, and ordered the top-gal|lant-&s;ails to be taken in, to prevent a di&s;covery: and this being the &s;tation in which he propo&s;ed to crui&s;e, he fixed the limits between the latitude of 12 deg. 50 min. N. and 13 deg. 5 min. the Cape it&s;elf lying in 12 deg. 40 min. N. and in 4 deg. of ea&s;t longitude from P&s;otel Tobago Xi|ma. It was now the time when the Manilla &s;hip was every hour expected; for they &s;eldom or never fail of making land in the month of June, and &s;ometimes &s;ooner, and it was now the la&s;t day of May, according to their &s;tile, when the Commodore took his &s;tation.</P>
<P>It were tedious to entertain the reader with the various conjectures, &s;urmi&s;es, doubts, and anxieties, that agitated the minds of the people on board, from the day they came in &s;ight of the Cape till the day that Mr. Charles Proby, a mid&s;hipman, called out from the ma&s;t-head, <HI>A &s;ail!</HI> This was on the 20th of June, ju&s;t one month after their arrival at the Cape. There did not remain a doubt but that it was one of the galleons (for two were expected this year, as none had been permitted to &s;ail the year pre|ceding); and the Commodore accordingly &s;tood towards her. At half after &s;even in the morn|ing, they could &s;ee her from the deck, at which time &s;he fired a gun to leeward, and took in her top-gallant-&s;ails, as a &s;ignal, as it was then &s;up|po&s;ed,

to her con&s;ort; but in reality, as a &s;ignal to her own people to prepare for action. The Commodore was &s;urprized to &s;ee her &s;teadily pur&s;ue her cour&s;e, and was now in no fear of lo&s;ing &s;ight of her, as at noon he could fetch her wake. Her con&s;ort not appearing, it was con|cluded they had parted company; and it now became vi&s;ible, that the galleon did not intend to fly, but to fight. Every preparation had been previou&s;ly made on board the Centurion, and all hands properly in&s;tructed; &s;o that every man on board repaired to his po&s;t with as much regula|rity and unconcern as if preparing for a review. Thirty of the be&s;t mark&s;men lined the tops; two men placed them&s;elves at a gun to load them; and gangs of ten men each were appointed to go from gun to gun, to run them out, and fire them as fa&s;t as they were loaded. A con&s;tant running fire was by this means kept up, and no interval allowed for the enemy to &s;tand to their guns in &s;afety, as is common when whole broad&s;ides are di&s;charged at once.</P>
<P>About one in the afternoon, the galleon haul|ed up her fore-&s;ail, and brought to under top-&s;ails, with her head to the northward, hoi&s;ting Spani&s;h colours, and having the &s;tandard of Spain flying at the top-gallant-ma&s;t-head. About the &s;ame time the Centurion hoi&s;ted her broad pen|dant and colours, being within gun-&s;hot of the enemy; and the Commodore, &s;eeing them clear|ing their decks of their cattle and lumber, gave orders to fire the chace-guns, to di&s;turb them in
<PB N="404" REF="415">
their work. The galleon returned the fire with two of her &s;tern-guns, one of which carried away one of our fore-&s;hrouds, and our fore&s;tay tackle, which could not have been done by an ordinary ball. The Centurion &s;etting her &s;prit-&s;ail fore-and aft for boarding, the galleon, out of a bra|vado, did the &s;ame. Soon after, the Centurion &s;hot a-brea&s;t of the enemy within pi&s;tol-&s;hot, and now the engagement became hot. For the fir&s;t half hour the Centurion over-reached the gal|leon, and lay on her bow, and, by the widene&s;s of her ports, could traver&s;e almo&s;t all her guns upon the enemy, whil&s;t the galleon could only bring a part of her's to bear upon the Centurion in return. In the heat of the action, the mats with which the galleon had &s;tuffed her netting took fire, and burnt violently, blazing up near as high as the mizzen-top. This accident threw the enemy into the utmo&s;t terror, and al&s;o alarmed the Commodore, for fear the galleon &s;hould be burnt, and for fear he him&s;elf might &s;uffer by being clo&s;ely grappled by her. Happily, how|ever, that danger was averted, and the fire ex|tingui&s;hed, by cutting away the netting, and let|ting the whole tumble into the &s;ea. All this while the Commodore kept his fir&s;t advanta|geous po&s;ition, firing with great regularity and bri&s;kne&s;s; while at the &s;ame time the galleon's decks lay open to our top-men, who, having at their fir&s;t volley driven the Spaniards from their tops, made prodigious havock with their &s;mall arms, killing or wounding every officer but one
<PB N="405" REF="416">
that appeared upon the quarter-deck, and wound|ing in particular the General of the galleon him|&s;elf. Thus the action continued for more than half an hour; but then the Centurion lo&s;t the &s;uperiority of her &s;ituation, and came clo&s;e along|&s;ide of the galleon, when the enemy continued their fire with great activity for near an hour longer; yet, even in this po&s;ition, the Commo|dore's grape-&s;hot &s;wept their decks &s;o effectual|ly, and the number of the dead and wounded be|came &s;o con&s;iderable, that they began to fall in|to great confu&s;ion, e&s;pecially as the General, who was the life of the action, was no longer able to exert him&s;elf. The di&s;order was &s;o great, that their officers were &s;een from the Centurion run|ning about to prevent the de&s;ertion of their men from their po&s;ts: but all their endeavours were in vain; for, after having, as a la&s;t effort, fired five or &s;ix guns with more judgment than u&s;ual, they yielded up the conte&s;t; and, the galleon's colours being &s;inged off the en&s;ign-&s;taff at the beginning of the engagement, &s;he &s;truck the &s;tandard at the main top-gallant-ma&s;t-head; but even this office would have been at the peril of the man's life, had not the Commodore, ob&s;erv|ing what he was about, given expre&s;s orders to leave off firing.</P>
<P>The Commodore, when the action was ended, re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of his way with his prize to the river Canton, being in the mean time fully employed in &s;ecuring his pri&s;oners, and in removing the trea&s;ure from on board the
<PB N="406" REF="417">
galleon into the Centurion. His fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was to commi&s;&s;ion the &s;hip, and put her under the command of proper officers: Lieut. Saumarez was appointed Captain, and was immediately or|dered on board to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his charge.</P>
<P>But, ju&s;t as the galleon had &s;truck, the officer who commanded between decks cam cup, &s;eem|ingly to congratulate the Commodore on his conque&s;t, but at the &s;ame time privately whi&s;per|ed to him, that the Centurion was dangerou&s;ly on fire near the powder-room. It &s;eems one of the lads, called powder-monkies, being heedle&s;s, a cartridge that he was carrying blew up in his hands; this fired another, and that three of the lower-deck guns on the off &s;ide of the &s;hip, which being happily loaded and laid down for &s;ervice, and the ports hauled up to vent the &s;moke, they did not occa&s;ion the lea&s;t mi&s;chief; however, the cartridges and guns together rai&s;ed &s;uch a &s;mother, that it was at fir&s;t doubtful whe|ther it proceeded from the explo&s;ion, or from a part of the &s;hip being on fire. In fact, upon ex|amination, it was found to proceed from both; for, part of a cartridge having fallen between the planks of the cieling, clo&s;e aft by the &s;cuttle of the Chaplain's cabbin, not only a con&s;ider|able &s;moke i&s;&s;ued out, but a very &s;en&s;ible heat, and, had it not been immediately extingui&s;hed, the con&s;equence would have been dreadful: to be brief, a few pails of water &s;ea&s;onably applied did more than all the water of the ocean could had effected after an hour's delay.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="418">This alarm being thus happily &s;ub&s;ided, we draughted out 50 of our people (of whom my|&s;elf was one) to board and man the prize. I had heard we had killed them 60 men, and wounded as many more, and expected to have &s;een the horrid &s;pectacle of mangled limbs, dead carca&s;&s;es, and decks covered with blood; but no &s;uch &s;pectacle appeared; a party having been properly &s;tationed, during the time of action, to wa&s;h away the blood, and to throw the dead over-board. We found, however, many de&s;perately wounded, and among them the General, who had received a mu&s;ket-ball in his brea&s;t, and was &s;o ill, or pretended to be &s;o ill, that it was judged un&s;afe to move him from him cabbin; but all the other officers, to|gether with the pa&s;&s;engers of note, were &s;ent on board the Centurion. Among the latter was an old gentleman, Governor of Guam, who was going to Manilla to renew his commi&s;&s;ion, and who had &s;carce mounted the Centurion's &s;ide before he was received with open arms by Mr. Crooden, Captain of marines, who 36 years before, at the battle of Almanza, had been his pri&s;oner, and honourably u&s;ed by him. The&s;e two renewed their old acquaintance, and Captain Crooden had a long-wi&s;hed for opportu|nity of returning the favours he had formerly re|ceived, and which he gratefully remembered.</P>
<P>The &s;hip, upon examination, was found to contain to the value of more than a million and
<PB N="408" REF="419">
a half of dollars, was called the Nue&s;tra Signora de Cabadonga, Don Jeronimo de Montero Commander, by nation a Portugue&s;e, and ac|counted the mo&s;t intrepid officer employed in the Spani&s;h mercantile &s;ervice: and, indeed, in my opinion, he was more brave than prudent; for, &s;urely, no wi&s;e man, intru&s;ted with &s;uch a cargo, &s;ix leagues to the windward of a man-of-war purpo&s;ely &s;tationed to intercept him, would have borne down upon his enemy, and braved him to his teeth, when, with the advan|tage of the wind, he might have gone &s;afe to port, from whence he was not more than 10 or 12 leagues di&s;tant, and where he might then have &s;et his pur&s;uer at defiance.</P>
<P>His galleon was indeed larger than the man-of-war, was pierced for 64 guns, but had only 36 mounted, mo&s;t of them 12 pounders, and 17 of them bra&s;s: &s;he had, be&s;ides, 28 petera|roes, in her gunwale, quarters, and tops, car|rying each a 4 lb. ball; and, before the engage|ment, &s;he mu&s;tered 640 men capable of bear|ing arms, officers and pa&s;&s;engers included. She was, be&s;ides, well furni&s;hed with &s;mall arms, and was particularly provided again&s;t boarding, both by her clo&s;e quarters, and by a &s;trong net|work of two-inch rope laced over her wa&s;te, and fortified with half-pikes placed in the man|ner of cheveaux de frize; but, notwith&s;tand|ing all her defences, &s;he had 64 men killed, and 84 wounded, whil&s;t the Centurion had only two men killed, and a Lieutenant and 16 men
<PB N="409" REF="420">
wounded, all of whom recovered, one man only excepted.</P>
<P>And now the Commodore learnt from &s;ome of the pri&s;oners, that the other &s;hip, which he had kept in the port of Acapulco the year be|fore, in&s;tead of returning in company with this, as was expected, had &s;ailed earlier in the &s;ea&s;on than u&s;ual, and was probably got into Manilla before the Centurion &s;et &s;ail from Mocao; &s;o that, notwith&s;tanding our pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s, we had rea&s;on to regret the lo&s;s of time occa&s;ioned by the delays of the Chine&s;e, which prevented our taking two rich prizes in&s;tead of one; though, to &s;ay the truth, it would not have been an ea&s;y ta&s;k to di&s;po&s;e of the pri&s;oners, which, even as it fell out, was a matter that gave the Commodore no &s;mall di&s;quietude; for they were above double the number of our own people; and &s;ome of them ob&s;erved, when they were brought aboard, how &s;lenderly we were manned; and the General him&s;elf could not help expre&s;&s;ing his indignation to be thus beaten by a handful of boys. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary for our own pre&s;ervation to prevent their ri&s;ing; and that could not be &s;ecurely ef|fected without exerci&s;ing a degree of &s;everity, which in any other circum&s;tances could not have been ju&s;tified on the principles of huma|nity; for there was no method practicable but that of &s;towing the men in the holds of the two &s;hips; and as for the officers, 17 in num|ber, they were confined in the Fir&s;t Lieutenant's
<PB N="410" REF="421">
cabbin, under a guard of &s;ix men, fir&s;t depriv|ing them of their arms, and then keeping a &s;trict watch on all their motions. Indeed, the &s;ufferings of the common men, &s;uch of them in particular who were not employed in navi|gating the &s;hip, were much to be pitied; for, the weather being extremely hot, the &s;tench of the holds loath&s;ome beyond conception, and their allowance of water but ju&s;t &s;ufficient to keep them alive, being only a pint a day for each man, it was next to a miracle that not a man of them died during their confinement, except five of the wounded, who expired the very night they were brought aboard the Cen|turion. Thus circum&s;tanced, the motives of humanity, as well as intere&s;t, &s;trongly urged the Commodore to ha&s;ten his return to China; and the prize being much damaged, both in her hull and rigging, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to take her in tow for the quicker di&s;patch.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of June it blew a &s;torm, which continued till the 25th, when the &s;ea ran moun|tains high: in this &s;torm the Centurion lo&s;t her long-boat, and the prize a launch.</P>
<P>On the 2d of July we pa&s;&s;ed between the Ba&s;hee I&s;lands, though the rippling of the &s;ea &s;eemed to indicate breakers or rocky ground; but the wind being &s;o far to the northward as to render it difficult to weather them, we ri&s;qued the danger to &s;horten the voyage. On the 8th of July we made the coa&s;t of China, and on the 11th came to an anchor off the city of
<PB N="411" REF="422">
Mocao; from thence we proceeded to the river of Canton, where we met with the u&s;ual ob|&s;tructions from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, and where the Commodore was again obliged, as it were, re&s;olutely to force his way to his in|tended &s;tation. The officer who came to take the dimen&s;ions of his &s;hips, in the u&s;ual man|ner, &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed when he talked of being exempted from the accu&s;tomed rates, and gave him to under&s;tand that the emperor's duty mu&s;t be paid by every &s;hip that came into his ports; and the pilot had private in&s;tructions not to carry the &s;hips through the Bocca Tygris, or narrow pa&s;s that forms the entrance into the river of Canton, till &s;ecurity was given for the accu&s;tomed charges.</P>
<P>And here it may be nece&s;&s;ary ju&s;t to mention, that this pa&s;s, not more than a quarter of a mile in breadth, is defended by two forts on the oppo&s;ite &s;ides; but the&s;e the Commodore di&s;regarding, and being determined to enter the river without delay, as the &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on was approaching, he cau&s;ed the pilot to be brought before him, and in a determined tone threaten|ed to hang him to the yard arm, if he did not in&s;tantly take charge of the &s;hip, and carry her &s;afe, without &s;triking ground, through the Bocca Tygris into the open river. The poor pilot performed his office, but did not e&s;cape puni&s;h|ment for what he could not help. He was in|&s;tantly &s;eized on being relea&s;ed from the Cen|turion, committed to pri&s;on, and rigorou&s;ly
<PB N="412" REF="423">
di&s;ciplined with the bamboo. However, he found means to get acce&s;s to the Commodore afterwards, to &s;upplicate a recompence, who, ever ready to reward the &s;ufferers in his &s;ervice, gave him &s;uch a &s;um as more than contented him for his whipping. Nor was the poor pilot the only &s;ufferer; for the Governors of the forts were both di&s;placed for not preventing what it was in vain for them to attempt to oppo&s;e, and for not doing what all the council mu&s;t know was impo&s;&s;ible to be done.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the Commodore &s;ent his Second Lieutenant to Canton, with a letter to the Vice|roy, a&s;&s;igning his rea&s;ons for putting into that port, demanding a licence for purcha&s;ing pro|vi&s;ions and &s;tores, and intimating an intention of waiting upon his Excellency in per&s;on to make his acknowledgements. The Lieutenant was civilly received, and promi&s;ed an an&s;wer the next day. In the mean time, the principal of|ficers of the prize de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to go to Canton on their parole, which was readily granted. The&s;e no &s;ooner arrived, than they were called before the magi&s;tracy, and examin|ed; when they generou&s;ly and frankly acknow|ledged, that they fell into the hands of the Commodore by the chance of war, and that though they were pri&s;oners, they were notwith|&s;tanding at liberty to treat for their relea&s;e: they &s;aid farther, that it was not the cu&s;tom among European nations to put pri&s;oners to death; but that the laws of war authorized
<PB N="413" REF="424">
much &s;everer treatment than they had hitherto met with from their conquerors. This confe&s;&s;ion from an enemy had great weight with the Chi|ne&s;e, who, till then, though they had revered the Commodore's naval force, had yet &s;u&s;pect|ed his morals, and had con&s;idered him rather as a lawle&s;s free-booter, than as one commi&s;&s;ioned by the &s;tate for the revenge of public injuries.</P>
<P>On the 20th of July, three Mandarines with their retinue came on board, and brought the Viceroy's permit for a daily &s;upply of provi&s;ions, and for pilots to carry the &s;hips up the river as high as the &s;econd bar; and, at the &s;ame time, they delivered a me&s;&s;age from the Viceroy, in an&s;wer to that part of the Commodore's letter which related to his vi&s;iting his Excellency; the &s;ub&s;tance of which me&s;&s;age was, that the Vice|roy wi&s;hed the Commodore to defer his vi&s;it till the hot &s;ea&s;on was over, but that, in September, when the weather would be more temperate, he &s;hould be glad to receive him. This the Com|modore looked upon as a fine&s;&s;e, knowing an expre&s;s was &s;ent up to the Emperor's court at Peking; whence the real motive for putting off the vi&s;it &s;eemed to be to gain time to receive the Emperor's in&s;tructions concerning the cere|mony to be ob&s;erved at his reception. The Mandarines, having di&s;patched this part of their commi&s;&s;ion, next entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the port charges; whereupon the Commodore at once cut them &s;hort, by telling them, that,
<PB N="414" REF="425">
as he did not come to trade, he was not to be treated upon the &s;ame footing with trading &s;hips; that his Britannic Maje&s;ty's &s;hips never paid cu&s;toms in the ports of Europe, nor ever would be &s;ubject to any pecuniary impo&s;ts in any other port whatever. Finding nothing to be gained on this head, they told the Commo|dore, that they had &s;till another matter in charge, and that was the relea&s;e of the pri&s;on|ers taken on board the galleon; for that the Emperor would never permit the &s;ubjects of princes with whom he was in alliance to be held in bondage in his dominions, nor could the Viceroy an&s;wer it to his Sovereign, if he &s;uffered it; and that, therefore, his Excellency hoped that the Commodore would give immediate orders for their relea&s;e.</P>
<P>Though nothing could be more agreeable to the Commodore, who wanted much to be rid of the incumbrance, than this requi&s;ition, yet, to inhance the favour, he at fir&s;t rai&s;ed difficul|ties; but at length &s;uffered him&s;elf to be pre|vailed upon by their intreaties, and concluded, by a&s;&s;uring them, that, to &s;hew his readine&s;s to oblige, he would deliver up the pri&s;oners when|ever the Viceroy would plea&s;e to order boats to fetch them. Matters being thus adju&s;ted, the Mandarines departed: and, in a few days, two Chine&s;e junks were &s;ent from Canton to carry them to Mocao, under the direction of one Captain Fial, Commander of a Spani&s;h mer|chant-man, to who&s;e &s;hip we gave chace in our
<PB N="415" REF="426">
pa&s;&s;age from the Ba&s;hee I&s;lands to Mocao, but lo&s;t &s;ight of her in the night.</P>
<P>To this gentleman the General of the galleon, and all his officers, except one who accompanied us to England, were delivered up. And now I have occa&s;ion to mention the General, I can|not help relating an affair which gave us on board the prize a great deal of concern, and &s;ufficient|ly &s;hewed the meanne&s;s of his &s;pirit, and his beggarly craft. I have already taken notice of his being wounded in the engagement, and of his being indulged with the u&s;e of his own cabbin till he was fit to be removed. The Com|modore, over and above this indulgence, &s;ent him a &s;urgeon from his own &s;hip, upon a com|plaint that the Spani&s;h &s;urgeon on board the galleon was quite ignorant in his profe&s;&s;ion; but at the &s;ame time he &s;ent an officer to demand his commi&s;&s;ion. Pretending to the officer that he was unable to move, he referred him to a &s;mall box in a locker of his private cabbin, in which, he &s;aid, it was, and likewi&s;e a &s;word-belt &s;et with diamonds of great value, his own property; but, upon &s;earch, neither the com|mi&s;&s;ion nor the belt could be found: and, as &s;ome of our people had been rummaging both that and other parts of the &s;hip, he prote&s;ted, that, if they could not be there found, they mu&s;t have been taken away and concealed. Under colour of this concealment, though he never produced his commi&s;&s;ion, he all along re|ceived the mo&s;t humane and gentlemanlike
<PB N="416" REF="427">
treatment that the mo&s;t worthy officer could de|&s;ire or expect; and &s;uch was continued till his departure, when neither his che&s;ts, of which he had two very large ones, nor any of his trunks or ca&s;es were &s;uffered to be &s;earched: but every thing which he claimed as his per&s;o|nal effects were delivered to him with the great|e&s;t care and punctuality; though, as I was af|terwards informed, he had many valuable ven|tures concealed, which ought to have been deli|vered up as prize to the captors; but, as that was never examined into, he carried them off with the re&s;t, and, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, was not the lea&s;t among the gainers by the capture of his &s;hip. He per&s;i&s;ted, however, to the la&s;t in the lo&s;s of his commi&s;&s;ion and belt, and, though there were none on board on whom he could charge the theft, yet the Commodore &s;ufficiently ex|pre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the whole by the prohibition he laid upon us, as &s;oon as the prize came to an anchor in the river, by which all communication was cut off between us and the country people, and no boat &s;uffered to come near us but our own; by which &s;evere order we were entirely debarred from purcha&s;ing our own provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries from the Chine&s;e, which the people in the Centurion were at full liberty to do; neither could we employ the Chine&s;e trade&s;men to &s;upply us with apparel, of which we &s;tood greatly in need, though in that too the Centurion's people were indulg|ed: and all this for no other rea&s;on, that was
<PB N="417" REF="428">
ever a&s;&s;igned, but that, if the jewels the Gene|ral had lo&s;t were concealed, the Commodore was determined the &s;ecreter &s;hould have no op|portunity of di&s;po&s;ing of them without being di&s;covered. Had this precaution been taken, as it ought, for the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who &s;uffered under the &s;everity of the cen&s;ure, and had the effects of the Spani&s;h General been pro|perly in&s;pected, the &s;ecreter would have been publicly expo&s;ed; for, when we afterwards fell down to Mocao with the &s;hips, where we &s;old the prize, I was my&s;elf told by an Iri&s;h prie&s;t, that the General had both his commi&s;|&s;ion and his belt; that he made no &s;ecret of the matter at Mocao; and that he had offered the jewels (being only made up by way of blind) among the merchants for &s;ale.</P>
<P>But to return: during our &s;tay in the river Can|ton, our people were employed in repairing the Centurion, over-hauling her &s;ails and rigging, clean&s;ing and ventilating her decks and quarters below, and in paying and decorating her hull; in&s;omuch, that when &s;he came to &s;ail, &s;he had more the appearance of a &s;hip newly fitted out, than one that had been a three-year's voyage in traver&s;ing the globe. While the&s;e things were doing on board the Centurion, we in the prize were bu&s;ied in rummaging for trea&s;ure, till a|bout the latter end of Augu&s;t, when we made a full end of our &s;earch, and found, upon ac|count of the captors, in &s;pecie, 1,278,546 dol|lars, and 1,324 of wrought plate and virgin
<PB N="418" REF="429">
&s;ilver. The jewels we found were not then valued.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that the inferior officers and &s;eamen were employed in the&s;e different &s;ervices, the Commodore had a &s;till more im|portant bu&s;ine&s;s in hand. He knew it was im|po&s;&s;ible for us to proceed to Europe without an ample &s;upply of provi&s;ions and other &s;ea-&s;tores; and, though we were furni&s;hed with a daily allowance, yet no order had been obtained for victualling us for our intended voyage. Ap|plication had indeed been made, and terms a|greed upon with the contractors to furni&s;h what|ever was nece&s;&s;ary; and they had undertaken to procure the Viceroy's permi&s;&s;ion for the de|livery; but when, about the middle of Septem|ber, the proper officer was &s;ent to enquire what forwardne&s;s the&s;e things were in, he found that neither the baker had begun to bake the bread, nor the butcher to kill the oxen, nor was the lea&s;t &s;tep taken to comply with any one article of the agreement. We could no otherwi&s;e ac|count for this faithle&s;s procedure of the Chi|ne&s;e, than by &s;uppo&s;ing they meant to &s;tarve us into a compliance with their accu&s;tomed de|mands for port charges, with which the Com|modore was determined never to acquie&s;ce. In|deed, it was &s;u&s;pected, that the contractors them&s;elves had &s;ome intere&s;t in promoting the delay, though it was not ea&s;y to penetrate the views by which they were influenced, as it may with truth be a&s;&s;erted, that in artifice, fal&s;hood,
<PB N="419" REF="430">
and attachment to all kinds of lucre, the Chi|ne&s;e, as a nation, are not to be paralleled by any other people under the &s;un. It were end|le&s;s to recount all the artifices, extortions, and frauds, which were practi&s;ed on the Commo|dore and his people by this intere&s;ted race. The method of buying provi&s;ions in China be|ing by weight, the tricks made u&s;e of to make them heavy are almo&s;t incredible. At one time a number of fowls and ducks being brought for the &s;hip's &s;tore, the greate&s;t part of them pre|&s;ently died, which &s;pread a general alarm on board le&s;t they &s;hould have died of poi&s;on; but, on examination, it was di&s;covered that they had been crammed with &s;mall &s;tones and gravel to increa&s;e their weight. The hogs, too, bought of the Chine&s;e butchers ready killed, were found to have had water injected into the car|ca&s;es for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and when, to avoid this cheat, the hogs were bought alive, it was found that &s;alt had been given them to increa&s;e their thir&s;t, that methods had been u&s;ed to &s;uppre&s;s their urine, and that the tortured ani|mals had been &s;old in that inflated &s;tate. Mr. Walter adds&mdash;[for it is on his authority that the&s;e in&s;tances are reported]&mdash;that, as the Chi|ne&s;e never &s;cruple to eat the animals that die of them&s;elves, they contrived, by their &s;ecret prac|tices, when the Commodore put to &s;ea, that part of his live &s;ea-&s;tore &s;hould die in a &s;hort time after it was put on board: in order, there|fore, to make a &s;econd profit of the dead car|ca&s;es
<PB N="420" REF="431">
which they expected would be thrown over-board, they followed in boats to pick up the carrion; and, accordingly, two thirds of the hogs dying before they were out of &s;ight of land, their labour could not be in vain.</P>
<P>The treachery of the contractors being now di&s;covered, the Commodore determined to re|new his former requi&s;ition for an audience with the Viceroy. With this view, he notified his intention to the proper Mandarine, and de&s;ired that he would fix the time with the Viceroy when he would be plea&s;ed to receive him; at the &s;ame time giving him to under&s;tand, that, on the fir&s;t of October, he intended to proceed in his boat to Canton. The Mandarine return|ed for an&s;wer, that he would acquaint the Vice|roy with the Commodore's intentions. As it was apprehended, that the payment of the cu&s;|tomary duties would be demanded at this inter|view, the Commodore took the nece&s;&s;ary pre|cautions to prevent the Chine&s;e from facilitating the &s;ucce&s;s of their preten&s;ions by having him in their power at Canton, and, therefore, gave the command of the Centurion to his Fir&s;t Lieut. Mr. Brett (now Sir Piercy), with orders, if he &s;hould be detained, to lie at the mouth of the river, and &s;uffer no &s;hip or boat to pa&s;s or re|pa&s;s till he was relea&s;ed, by which the whole navigation of the river would be immediately ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>This being known to the Chine&s;e, they were now more than ever embarra&s;&s;ed in their deli|berations.
<PB N="421" REF="432">
The morning of the fir&s;t of October arrived, and ju&s;t as the boat's crew, eighteen in number, which the Commodore propo&s;ed to take with him, appeared in their uniform, namely, &s;carlet jackets and blue &s;ilk wai&s;tcoats, the whole trimmed with &s;ilver, with &s;ilver badges on their jackets and caps, his lingui&s;t came to him from the Mandarine, to tell him, that a letter had been received from the Vice|roy, de&s;iring the Commodore to defer his in|tended purpo&s;e for two or three days, which not being doubted, the men were ordered to be undre&s;t, and the preparations were all laid a&s;ide; but, in the afternoon of the &s;ame day, another lingui&s;t came on board, &s;eemingly in a great panic, informing him, that the Viceroy had ex|pected him up that day; that the council was a&s;|&s;embled, and the troops under arms to receive him; and that the Viceroy was highly incen&s;ed at the di&s;appointment, and had &s;ent the Com|modore's lingui&s;t to pri&s;on, chained, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be the &s;ole cau&s;e of the contempt. This plau&s;ible tale gave the Commodore great unea&s;ine&s;s, not at that time &s;u&s;pecting any im|po&s;ition; and though it afterwards appeared to be all a mere farce, yet the fal&s;hood was &s;o well &s;upported by the artifices of the Chine&s;e merchants, that three days afterwards the Com|modore received a letter, &s;igned by all the Su|percargoes of the Engli&s;h &s;hips then at the place, expre&s;&s;ing their unea&s;ine&s;s at what had happen|ed, and intimating their fears that &s;ome in&s;ult
<PB N="422" REF="433">
would be offered to his boat, if he attempted to come to Canton before the Viceroy was fully &s;a|tisfied of the mi&s;take. To this letter the Com|modore replied, that he did not believe there had been a mi&s;take, but was per&s;uaded it was a forgery of the Chine&s;e to prevent his vi&s;iting the Viceroy; that, therefore, he would certainly come up to Canton on the 13th of October, confident that the Chine&s;e would not dare to offer him any in&s;ult, as well knowing he &s;hould want neither power nor inclination to make them a proper return.</P>
<P>On the 13th of October, the Commodore continuing firm to his re&s;olutions, all the Super|cargoes of the Engli&s;h, Dani&s;h, and Swedi&s;h &s;hips, came on board the Centurion, to accom|pany him to Canton, for which place he &s;et out in his barge the &s;ame day, attended by his own boats, and by tho&s;e of the trading &s;hips, which on this occa&s;ion were &s;ent to augment his reti|nue. As he pa&s;&s;ed by Wampo where the Eu|ropean ve&s;&s;els by, he was &s;aluted by all of them except the French, and in the evening he ar|rived &s;afely at Canton.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e merchants, who affected to ap|pear very much plea&s;ed that he had met with no oppo&s;ition in his way, pretended that the Viceroy was then &s;o fully employed in preparing his di&s;patches for Peking, that there was no get|ting admittance to him; but that they had en|gaged one of the officers of his court, as &s;oon as he was at lei&s;ure, to notify the Commodore's
<PB N="423" REF="434">
arrival, and endeavour to fix the audience. Though the Commodore knew this to be a fal&s;ehood, yet he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be per&s;uad|ed by the European Supercargoes not to appear to doubt it, provided the Chine&s;e merchants would undertake that his bread &s;hould be bak|ed, his meat &s;alted, and his &s;tores in readine&s;s, within the &s;pace of 40 days; after which time, if the lea&s;t article was pretended to be forgot|ten, he would force his way to the Viceroy, and prefer his complaint. During the interval, while the contractors were endeavouring in earne&s;t to fulfil the terms of the agreement on their part, (which by the way they in&s;i&s;ted &s;hould be paid for in advance on his), a fire broke out in the &s;uburbs of Canton, which on the fir&s;t alarm might ea&s;ily have been extingui&s;hed, by pulling down &s;ome of the adjoining &s;heds; which the Commodore with his officers and crew ob&s;erv|ing, were in&s;tantly about to carry into execu|tion; but they were told, that whatever they pulled down they mu&s;t build up again at their own expence, and that none but a Mandarine mu&s;t pre&s;ume to direct upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. The Commodore, on this admonition, di&s;patched his people to the Engli&s;h factory to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;ecuring their effects, as it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that no di&s;tance was &s;afe from fire, where the common people contented them&s;elves with gaz|ing at it, and now-and-then holding up an idol or two to extingui&s;h it. At length, however, a Mandarine came out of the city, with 4 or 500
<PB N="424" REF="435">
firemen, who made &s;ome very feeble efforts to pull down the neighbouring hou&s;es; but by this time the fire had extended it&s;elf, and had &s;pread among the merchants warehou&s;es, where the Chine&s;e firemen had neither &s;pirit nor &s;kill to encounter it; &s;o that it was feared the whole city would have been laid in a&s;hes. In this emergency, the Viceroy vouch&s;afed to make his appearance, and a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to the Com|modore, reque&s;ting his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Accordingly, he ha&s;tened a &s;econd time, with about 40 of his people, to the place where the fire raged with the mo&s;t violence, and in &s;ight of the whole city performed &s;uch daring, and, to the people who beheld them, &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing feats, that they looked upon them as &s;alamanders, and cried out, that they could live in fire. In truth, it was no uncommon thing to &s;ee the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t ac|tive among them tumble on the roofs amid&s;t the ruins of the hou&s;es which their own efforts had brought down under them. And thus, by their re&s;olution and agility, the fire was very &s;oon &s;ub|dued, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the Chine&s;e who were &s;pectators of the wonders they performed. On this occa&s;ion the Swedi&s;h was the only Euro|pean factory that &s;uffered; yet on my arrival in England, to my no &s;mall diver&s;ion, I read in the Paris Gazette, that the city of Canton had been almo&s;t wholly de&s;troyed; and that, in particular, the Engli&s;h, Dutch, Dani&s;h, and Portugue&s;e factories, had been burnt down, and almo&s;t all their effects con&s;umed; but that the French
<PB N="425" REF="436">
factory had providentially e&s;caped, their goods being all &s;hipped before the conflagration reach|ed the quarter allotted for their re&s;idence.</P>
<P>This &s;ignal a&s;&s;i&s;tance gained the Admiral much re&s;pect, he was the next day waited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">on by the principal inhabitants with pre&s;ents and thanks; and &s;oon after, a me&s;&s;age came from the Viceroy appointing the 30th of No|vember for the day of audience. Being highly plea&s;ed with this la&s;t intimation, he in&s;tantly gave orders for the nece&s;&s;ary preparations; and engaged Mr. Flint, a gentleman belonging to the Engli&s;h factory, for his interpreter, who, being trained up from his infancy among the Chine&s;e, &s;poke their language fluently, and who was not afraid to declare with boldne&s;s what the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">miral delivered him in charge, a part which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Chine&s;e interpreters would not have dared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> performed with equal fidelity.</P>

Thus happily concluded this long-expected audience; and, in pur&s;uance of the Viceroy's promi&s;es, the provi&s;ions were begun to be &s;hipped the very next day: and now all the preparations for put|ting to &s;ea were pur&s;ued with &s;o much expedition, that by the 9th the Centurion and her prize were ready to unmoor, and on the 10th pa&s;&s;ed through the Bocca Tygris into the open road, and on the 12th anchored before the town of Mocao. While they lay here, the Portugue&s;e merchants entered into treaty with the Commo|dore for the purcha&s;e of the prize, for which they would give no more than 6000 dollars, though worth double that &s;um; but the impa|tience of the Commodore to be gone, that he might him&s;elf be the me&s;&s;enger of his own good fortune, and thereby prevent the enterprizes of the enemy to intercept him, prevailed upon him to conclude the bargain; and, &s;he being deliver|ed on the 15th of December, and the money received, in the afternoon of the &s;ame day he hoi&s;ted &s;ail, and took his departure for his na|tive home. On the 3d of January he came to an anchor on Prince's I&s;land, in the &s;traits of Sunda, where he &s;taid the be&s;t part of five days to wood and water, and on the 8th weighed and continued his cour&s;e. From this time till
<PB N="428" REF="439">
the 20th we had foul and &s;tormy weather, &s;o bad, that I thought it impo&s;&s;ible to meet with &s;uch in latitudes &s;o near the Equator; and the wind blowing directly again&s;t us, we were driven pretty near the coa&s;t of New Holland; and, had it continued blowing from the &s;ame quarter, with equal violence, for 48 hours longer, we &s;hould have found it difficult to have cleared that coa&s;t; but, on the 21&s;t, the wind abated, and the weather became moderate. On the 24th, the trade-wind &s;et in, and we then pro|ceeded on our pa&s;&s;age with the highe&s;t alacrity.</P>
<P>On the 22d of February, at half after four in the morning, I di&s;covered a comet to the ea&s;tward, near the horizon, being, as I judged, lately emerged from the &s;un's rays. Its tail was at this time about 10 degrees in length; but in le&s;s than a fortnight it increa&s;ed and ex|tended it&s;elf to near 40 degrees. Its head ap|peared very large and bright; and, on a nice in&s;pection, I have perceived it when the &s;un has been about a diameter above the horizon. The next time I ob&s;erved its di&s;tance from the planet Venus to be 26 deg. 50 min. following the order of the planets; but not having in|&s;truments proper for taking altitudes without a very obvious &s;en&s;ible horizon, I was prevent|ed from making more &s;atisfactory ob&s;ervations. From this time, till the 6th of March, we had plea&s;ant weather, with few exceptions; but on that and the three following days, being near the Cape of Good Hope, we had &s;ome boi&s;te|rous

&s;torms; yet, when we arrived at Table|bay, on the 11th, the Dutch knew not that any &s;uch had happened. We found riding here two Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indiamen, the Sali&s;bury and Warwick, each of which &s;aluted us with 13 guns, and we returned 11. We al&s;o found five Dutch &s;hips, one of which having, as Admi|ral, a flag at his main-top-ma&s;t-head, &s;aluted us with 9 guns, to which we returned 7. At 11 at night we parted our be&s;t bower cable and haw&s;er, both of which were very rotten, and the next day moored again with others pur|cha&s;ed from the Dutch. Here the Commodore continued till the beginning of April, highly delighted with the place, and during his &s;tay entered about 40 new men. On the 3d of May, having compleated our water and provi|&s;ions, we on that day weighed and put to &s;ea. On the 19th of April we pa&s;&s;ed within &s;ight of the i&s;land of St. Helena, which, however, we did not vi&s;it. On the 26th we caught on board the &s;hip a &s;nake that mea&s;ured in length &s;ix feet and two inches, which our &s;urgeon, on examination, pronounced to be perfectly harm|le&s;s. It was &s;uppo&s;ed to be brought on board with our wood, at Prince's I&s;land, in the &s;traits of Sunda. The 30th, being before the wind, with a fine breeze, and a gentle rain, a violent and &s;udden &s;quall took us a-head, threw all the &s;hip's &s;ails a-back, carried away her fore-top-&s;ail yard, &s;plit the fore-&s;ail, the fore-top-&s;ail, the fore-top-gallant-&s;ail, and the mizzen and

<P>The 9th of June, in the evening, it being a thick fog, we on a &s;udden &s;aw a &s;hip clo&s;e by us; we fired a &s;hot, and brought her too. She proved an Engli&s;h &s;hip from Am&s;terdam, bound for Philadelphia or Carolina, with Palatine emi|grants. She gave us the fir&s;t notice of a war with France, and proceeded on her voyage. The 10th of June we came into &s;oundings. The 11th, at half pa&s;t eleven in the morning, we di&s;covered three &s;ail, and at one in the after|noon &s;poke with one of them, being a Dutch &s;hip from Dublin. At the &s;ame time, the &s;e|cond, being pretty near us, &s;hewed Dutch co|lours. The third, who had been in chace of the others the whole day, perceiving we de|&s;igned to &s;peak with her, &s;tood from us with all the &s;ail &s;he could crowd. We gave chace to her for about three hours, when, finding we did not gain upon her, we re&s;umed our former cour&s;e. On the 12th, in the morning, the fog clearing up, we perceived the Lizard Point: but that the &s;ignal perils, which had &s;o often threatened us, and from which we had been more than once providentially delivered, might be di&s;coverable to the la&s;t, we were afterwards told, that there was a French fleet of con&s;ide|rable force crui&s;ing in the chops of the chan|nel

But this plot was prevented, when ju&s;t upon the point of execution, by means of the prie&s;t on board, who, having taken the confe&s;&s;ion of one of the con&s;pirators as he lay at the point of death, pur&s;ued proper mea&s;ures to defeat their bloody purpo&s;es, and to bring three of the ring-leaders to condign puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>But, though this combination failed of its effect, there were other di&s;tre&s;&s;es that multiplied upon them, and which could not be prevented. Hunger and thir&s;t, the mo&s;t dreadful of all other calamities, daily became more grievous; the &s;hips grew continually more and more leaky, and the men le&s;s able to &s;tand at the pumps; nothing was to be &s;een but de&s;pon|dency in every countenance; nothing heard but lamentations and complaints, which were em|bittered by the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of reliev|ing them. Under the weight of the&s;e affecting circum&s;tances, the A&s;ia was near &s;inking, when &s;he arrived at Monte Vedio with &s;carce half her crew alive. The E&s;tevan, when &s;he anchored in the bay of Barragan, had in like manner lo&s;t about the &s;ame number of her hands; but, what was &s;till wor&s;e, and is almo&s;t incredible, the E&s;|peranza, out of a crew of 450 &s;eamen which &s;he brought from Spain, had only 58 that reached the &s;hore, and the whole regiment of &s;oldiers, 60 men only excepted, peri&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="447">Being now in want of all kinds of nece&s;&s;aries, ma&s;ts, yards, rigging, provi&s;ions, and money, Pizarro di&s;patched an expre&s;s over land to St. Jago, in Chili, to be from thence forwarded to the Viceroy of Peru, de&s;iring a remittance of 200,000 dollars; and what mu&s;t a&s;toni&s;h the reader is, that the Indian who was charged with this di&s;patch, though in the depth of winter, when the Cordilleras are judged impa&s;&s;able by rea&s;on of the &s;now, was only 13 days in his journey from Buenos Ayres to St. Jago, places di&s;tant from each other 300 Spani&s;h leagues. At the &s;ame time an advice-boat was &s;ent with a letter of credit to Rio Janeiro, to purcha&s;e what was wanting of the Portugue&s;e; but nei|ther the one nor the other of the&s;e di&s;patches &s;ucceeded to the wi&s;h of the Spani&s;h Admiral. The Viceroy, in&s;tead of 200,000 dollars, &s;ent him only 100,000; and the Portugue&s;e, in&s;tead of furni&s;hing him with ma&s;ts and yards, the principal articles of naval &s;tores that he wanted, &s;pared him only &s;ome pitch, tar, and cordage, with which he was obliged to be contented: but a more mortifying di&s;appointment he had &s;till to &s;uffer; for a carpenter, whom, after the re|turn of the money, he had tru&s;ted with a con|&s;iderable &s;um, and whom he had &s;ent up into the country of Puraguay to cut ma&s;ts, in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting the bu&s;ine&s;s with which he was entru&s;ted, married in the country, and &s;ettled out of his reach, refu&s;ing to return.</P>
<P>In this dilemma, the only thing that could
<PB N="437" REF="448">
be done, was, to &s;hift the ma&s;ts of the E&s;pe|ranza into the A&s;ia, and to fit up the E&s;tevan with what &s;pare ma&s;ts and yards they could mu&s;ter, and with the&s;e two &s;hips to hazard a &s;econd attempt to double Cape Horn, as it was now &s;ummer, and the weather le&s;s &s;evere. But a certain fatality &s;eemed to pre&s;ide over every part of this unfortunate expedition. The E&s;te|van, as &s;he was coming down the river Plate, ran on a &s;hoal and beat off her rudder; and the A&s;ia, though &s;he proceeded alone with mode|rate weather and a favourable gale, yet when &s;he came to the height of Cape Horn, and was tacking to change her cour&s;e to the we&s;t|ward, by &s;ome mi&s;conduct in wearing the &s;hip, rolled away her ma&s;ts, and was a &s;econd time forced back to the river of Plate; from whence Pizarro undertook to cro&s;s the conti|nent by land, and with &s;ome difficulty accom|pli&s;hed his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>By this time Don Mindinuetta, Captain of the Guipu&s;coa, wrecked, as has been &s;aid, on the coa&s;t of Brazil, arrived, with tho&s;e of his crew who e&s;caped, at the place of general ren|dezvous; and, finding the E&s;peranza without ma&s;ts, applied a &s;econd time to the Portugue&s;e, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he completed her repair, and, in 1742, doubled the Cape, and arrived in the South Seas, where he was met by Pizarro, who claimed the command of the E&s;peranza, which Mindinuetta di&s;puting, an irreconcileable quarrel aro&s;e between the two Commanders,

which the Viceroy of Peru in vain endeavoured to reconcile. In 1745, they both returned over land to the coa&s;t of Brazil, where they found the A&s;ia &s;till in a &s;hattered condition. This &s;hip, however, they determined to carry to Europe, and, with this view, they fitted her up in the be&s;t manner they could; and, having manned her partly with Portugue&s;e, partly with Engli&s;h pri&s;oners, and partly with Spaniards, together with &s;ome Indians whom they forced out of the country, they &s;et &s;ail from Monte Vedio for Eu|rope about the beginning of November; but they had not been long at &s;ea before the In|dians, eleven in number, formed a con&s;piracy to de&s;troy the Spaniards, and to regain their liberty, in which they had hopes of being joined by the Engli&s;h and Portugue&s;e, whom the Spa|niards u&s;ed with great in&s;olence. At the head of this con&s;piracy was their Chief Orellana; and one evening, about nine o'clock, he and his companions came all together on the quar|ter-deck, and drew towards the door of the great cabbin. The boat&s;wain immediately repri|manded them, and ordered them to be gone; on this Orellana &s;poke to his followers in his native language, when four of them drew off, two towards each gangway, and the Chief and the remaining &s;ix &s;eemed to be &s;lowly quitting the quarter-deck.
