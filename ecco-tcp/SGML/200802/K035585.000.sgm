<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE world is obliged to an unknown author for the following excellent poems. They were &s;ent to Mr <HI>Donald&s;on,</HI> with intention to be publi&s;hed in the &s;econd volume of his collection of poems, which will appear next winter. But, upon being examined by &s;ome gentlemen of ta&s;te, they were thought to have &s;o much merit, that they are here offered to the public by them|&s;elves. As none need be a&s;hamed of encou|raging genius, the gentlemen who&s;e opinions were con&s;ulted, have permitted them to be printed with the initials of their names. It is to be hoped that any inaccuracies in the letters will be excu&s;ed, as they were wrote in a great hurry, with little regard to &s;tyle, being indeed nothing more than the warm overflowings of &s;ouls &s;u&s;ceptible of the ra|vi&s;hing beauties of genuine poetry.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ju&s;t now favoured with your obliging letter, inclo&s;ing &s;ome copies of ver&s;es. I return you thanks for the favourable opinion you entertain of my ta&s;te: but permit me to &s;ay, that C&mdash;n E&mdash; has no occa&s;ion to call in the aid of any other judg|ment, to enable him to determine the merit of works of ta&s;te and genius, e&s;pecially of the poetic kind. A good author mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a &s;ound critic; and one who di&s;covers &s;o much fire, and, at the &s;ame time, correctne&s;s, in his own produc|tions, is well qualified to judge of the beauties and defects of others. But as extreme mode&s;ty is of|ten the attendant of con&s;ummate merit, I &s;uppo&s;e you don't care to rely &s;olely on your own judgment in a matter of this con&s;equence. You are anxious that Mr Donald&s;on's collection &s;hould be uniform, and that the &s;econd volume &s;hould contain nothing unworthy of the fir&s;t; for which rea&s;on, perhaps,
<PB N="6" REF="4">
you with to have your own opinion of the&s;e two poems confirmed by mine; on which, I am afraid, you rely more than it de&s;erves. Probably the laws of Parna&s;&s;us, like tho&s;e of our own country, re|quire two witne&s;&s;es to a&s;certain any fact of import|ance.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed: I am a&s;toni&s;hed how, during this long preamble, I have been able to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e exclamations of applau&s;e, which I utter in&s;en|&s;ibly every time I read or think of the&s;e poems. By heavens! I never &s;aw any thing that plea&s;ed me more. Nor do I know to which the preference is due. In the elegy however, I am apt to think, the author's genius appears mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly; and, if I am not mi&s;taken, his turn rather leads him to the plaintive &s;trains of Terence, than to the gay and animated compo&s;itions of Tibullus. The &s;ub|ject too is happily cho&s;en. The bard &s;eems to be young; and what &s;ubject &s;uits the warm imagina|tion and delicate &s;en&s;ibility of a juvenile poet, bet|ter than the early, premature, and unexpected death of a lady, for whom he probably entertained the mo&s;t refined affection! It is upon occa&s;ions of this
<PB N="7" REF="5">
kind that a poet can give way to tho&s;e emotions of grief and angui&s;h, which never fail to affect every reader of ta&s;te with &s;adne&s;s and melancholy. When the mind is truly agitated, it de&s;pi&s;es trivial orna|ments; it overlooks &s;mall inaccuracies. To this is to be imputed your meeting with nothing very orna|mented or figurative in the diction, and now and then with a hard word, ill &s;pelled, and wor&s;e cho&s;en. Does not the native &s;implicity of the poet, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, atone for the&s;e defects?
<Q><L><HI>Thou number'd lies among the numerous dead.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>How pretty is that recurrence of numbers in the &s;ame line! yet happily is it varied: and, if you will try, as Mr Sheridan directs you, to pronounce the&s;e words frequently, you will ob&s;erve how trippingly they go off the tongue, <HI>numerous number, numerous number;</HI> and there is a cadence on the la&s;t &s;yllable, <HI>ber,</HI> that I defy you not to pronounce. You may ob&s;erve al&s;o the propriety of the epithet <HI>numerous,</HI> when applied to the dead.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">
THE conclu&s;ion al&s;o is mo&s;t tender and affecting, and contains that abruptne&s;s, and tho&s;e repetitions which con&s;titute the language of grief.
<Q><L><HI>Adieu,&mdash;adieu,&mdash;a long&mdash;a la&s;t farewell.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I HAVE only to add, that in&s;tead of advi&s;ing Mr Donald&s;on to re&s;erve the&s;e poems for his collection, or even indeed, in compliance with the author's re|que&s;t, to bury them in a Magazine, I &s;hould think he would do both him&s;elf and the author more ju|&s;tice to publi&s;h them on a &s;mall detached quarto of two or three pages. By this means they would be univer&s;ally known and admired, and would certainly add lu&s;tre and eclat to the collection in which they &s;hould afterward appear. It is by this obvious and ingenious method that my good friend Mr Dod&s;ley at London has e&s;tabli&s;hed his reputation as a man of ta&s;te, enriched him&s;elf, and become the only book|&s;eller in that city, really known to, and e&s;teemed by people of fa&s;hion and rank. In great ha&s;te, I &s;ub|mit the&s;e ob&s;ervations to you; but I wi&s;h you would
<PB N="9" REF="7">
al&s;o con&s;ult Mr B&mdash;, who really has a very &s;ound judgment in matters of this kind.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t now received your epi&s;tle, which contains, I think, the mo&s;t candid critici&s;m I ever &s;aw: I was only &s;orry to &s;ee it &s;o &s;hort; every line of poetry, I am &s;ure, de&s;erves two of ob&s;erva|tions; but what I am remarkably plea&s;ed with, is the &s;trange coincidence between your &s;entiments and mine. I may really and with truth &s;ay, that the fir&s;t time I beheld you, I &s;aw in your face a true feeling and ju&s;t reli&s;h of the fine arts, particularly poetry, (poetry &s;ent down by the gods, to chear us
<PB N="10" REF="8">
in this gloomy, forlorn, and dreary wa&s;te of life); I &s;aw numbers (both blank ver&s;es and rhymes) im|printed upon your countenance; and if you had pre|&s;ented me with an epic poem &s;uperior to Homer's, I &s;hould not have been &s;urpri&s;ed. Euripides, the famous Greek poet, has a line &s;o agreeable to what I am &s;aying, that I cannot forbear &s;ending you a tran&s;lation of it:
<Q><L><HI>Apollo light'ned in his cat-grey eyes.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>IN fact, the only way of judging the merit of a poet is by his eyes. It was in this manner Homer was found out, although he was blind. Your mo|de&s;ty has, I know, as yet only &s;uffered you to pu|bli&s;h in the <HI>Scots Magazine;</HI> but, alas! one might as well pretend to exhibit a little cow as a &s;how in the highlands of Scotland, a pur&s;e of gold as &s;omewhat remarkable on the coa&s;t of Guinea, or a t&mdash;d as an extraordinary &s;pectacle in the &s;treets of Edinburgh, as endeavour to become con&s;picuous in that ill-fated collection. Would you believe it, Sir? A fable of mine, full of the <HI>naivette</HI> or &s;implicity ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, after being in&s;erted there, was never, (with a&s;toni&s;hment I &s;peak it, and
<PB N="11" REF="9">
with amazement you &s;hall hear it), I &s;ay, never heard of more; lo&s;t like a goodly city &s;uddenly &s;wallowed up by an earthquake, like a lou&s;e annihilated in a large fire, or a human excrement dropped in a full capacious chamberpot. Oh! my friend, let this deter you; and, for heaven's &s;ake, chu&s;e &s;ome other me|thods of making your compo&s;itions public. In this ca&s;e, what expedient &s;o readily offers as making u&s;e of the humane and benevolent Mr D&mdash;, a gentle|man, who, like a friendly &s;tar, helps every dark and benighted poet into the haven of general appro|bation. By his help, the rays of my genius have diverged with uncommon and rapid &s;treams of lumi|nary particles, into the remote&s;t and mo&s;t unenlight|ened corners of the&s;e kingdoms: by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance Mr B&mdash; is to fix the nave of that wheel, who&s;e &s;pokes will reach &s;uch a prodigious di&s;tance. Would to GOD we three could live to late&s;t po&s;terity, and be witne&s;&s;es of our applau&s;e from ages yet to come, world without end. Prai&s;e is the food of poets; notwith&s;tanding Mr D&mdash; frequently gives them very good dinners. This of cour&s;e brings me back to the &s;ubject of this letter, which I did not think &s;o &s;oon to have entered upon, as I had a few more
<PB N="12" REF="10">
points to di&s;cu&s;s. But to proceed: The bard, of who&s;e poems we have been all this time talking, &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s the true elegiac humanity of Glu|theros, who flouri&s;hed before or about the time of Homer. It is true, he is not &s;o merry as Lucretius, nor &s;o &s;ad as Horace; neither is he altogether &s;o &s;oft and tender as Juvenal in his &s;atires; he is not quite &s;o <HI>&s;implex</HI> in his <HI>munditiis</HI> as Lucan, neither has his work the modern air of the old poet Ennius; but the&s;e are &s;light faults. I cannot pretend to &s;ay whe|ther he writes elegies like Terence, as I never &s;aw that book in which they are contained, the only copy of which, they &s;ay, is lodged in the bend of the hanging tower at Pi&s;a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Father Montfaucon's antiquities of Italy.</NOTE>. Here I cannot help re|gretting that I have as yet travelled very little; how happy are you, Sir, in that re&s;pect? I think it was at Rome you got your copy of the great Glutheros, which is an invaluable curio&s;ity. For my part, I once drank a gla&s;s of old hock out of Buchanan's head at Copenhagen, which was the only remarkable in|cident that happened me in a long voyage up the Mediterranean. I agree with you in thinking that the bard, of whom we have all this time been talk|ing,
<PB N="13" REF="11">
di&s;covers here and there a noble negligence of grammar and &s;pelling; this is what Mr Pope calls (who by the by was a very bad poet) catching a grace beyond the reach of art; but the&s;e two arts, as Mr Sheridan &s;ays, I am afraid we know little about. I dare &s;ay he goes upon &s;ure ground, and has good rea&s;ons for what he does; not that I have any particular rea&s;on for &s;aying &s;o. The epi&s;tle after the elegy &s;eems to be much in the &s;tyle of Pliny; there is nothing like it in our language. Ea&s;y and pathetic, &s;ublime and natural, it pre&s;ents us with a picture of love and friend&s;hip not to be parallelled; it is really a capital piece. The&s;e two poems ought indeed to be printed &s;eparately. I mu&s;t here con|clude; but I fir&s;t congratulate Mr D&mdash; on this, I may &s;ay, the &s;econd revival of letters. I did not indeed think of being guilty of the fault which I ac|cu&s;ed you of in the beginning of my letter; but as I intend to dine with you to-day, I &s;hall re&s;ume this &s;ubject when I take leave of you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACCEPT the mo&s;t &s;incere thanks of a mind full of gratitude, for the favour you have this day loaded me with. The exqui&s;ite entertain|ment which I have received from the peru&s;al of the inclo&s;ed poems, is rather to be conceived than ex|pre&s;&s;ed. The critical letters upon the&s;e pieces by Mr D&mdash; and your&s;elf, I admire beyond mea&s;ure. The greate&s;t compliment I can pay them, is to tell, without di&s;gui&s;e, the &s;imple, or, to u&s;e a better word, naked truth; which is, that I could read them with &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction, even after an immediate peru&s;al of the poems them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I CONGRATULATE with my country, that we now behold, with eyes full of intrepid wonder and pre|mature a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;uch a poet! and &s;uch critics!</P>
<P>IT is doing me too much honour to be cla&s;&s;ed with Mr E&mdash; and Mr D&mdash;, of both who&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="13">
abilities the world has already had, and is likely to have &s;o many glaring proofs; whil&s;t I can only a|&s;pire to the appellation of, as it were, a hackney|coachman of Helicon. You &s;ee I am apt to run in|to the figurative &s;tyle, which, I hope, you will im|pute to an imagination heated by a recent peru&s;al of &s;uperlative poe&s;y.</P>
<P>DEAR SIR, why do you a&s;k me to give my opi|nion?&mdash;Or, indeed, what other opinion can I give than what has already been &s;o amply given?&mdash;But as you in&s;i&s;t upon my &s;aying &s;omething, I &s;hall do &s;o.</P>
<P>THE elegy is perhaps the complete&s;t thing of the kind I have ever &s;een. Even you C&mdash;n E&mdash;, who plume your&s;elf &s;o much on your tender, &s;igh|ing, breathing, and &s;peaking lines, mu&s;t not be of|fended, though I frankly own that you have not gone &s;o great lengths as this gentleman.</P>
<P>THE PRIDE OF PRIME is an expre&s;&s;ion which you have not as yet attained to. I que&s;tion much if you ever will.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="14">
THE ingenious author of an e&s;&s;ay on the &s;ublime and beautiful gives it as his opinion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a cer|tain inflated and incohe&s;ive rotundity of diction, is one of the leading &s;ources of what is grand and lofty."</Q> Our author has certainly reached that dizzy &s;ummit in this memorable line,
<Q><L><HI>To &s;uch maje&s;tic, &s;uch exalting &s;trains.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THE epi&s;tle affords a &s;triking example of the ele|vated &s;tyle.&mdash;At fir&s;t, indeed, I imagined our au|thor had been a plagiary, and &s;tolen whole &s;tanzas from Dryden's Alexander's Fea&s;t.&mdash;But, upon comparing the two poems together, with all the attention and accuracy that I po&s;&s;ibly could, I di&s;|covered that I lay under a very palpable mi&s;take, and had done the author much inju&s;tice: for, &s;o far has he been from &s;tooping to filch from Jack Dry|den, (as the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of Bangor u&s;ed to &s;ay), that, upon my word, there was not the lea&s;t atom of &s;imilarity either in thought or language.</P>
<P>I HAD almo&s;t forgot to take notice of one pecu|liar circum&s;tance, which has eluded the penetration
<PB N="17" REF="15">
of you, as well as that of Mr D&mdash;, although it is perhaps as material a perfection as any in the whole work: and that is the mention that is made of Wilkie, who&s;e poem, called the <HI>Epigoniad,</HI> we have, with infinite regret, beheld but too too much neglected.</P>
<P>DOES it not kindle a flame in every patriot brea&s;t, to think that now the modern epic poem of Scot|land &s;hall &s;tand upon a firm ba&s;is, &s;hall &s;wim in a pellucid whirlpool, when it is at la&s;t hoi&s;ted upon the &s;houlders of a Brobdignagian genius (according to Swift), or rather, (to u&s;e the words of Sir Wil|liam Temple, in his hi&s;tory of the Netherlands), when it is held forth to the applau&s;e and admiration of <HI>po&s;terity,</HI> by a giant of Parna&s;&s;us?</P>
<P>I ENTIRELY agree with my two good friends and fellow-rhym&s;ters, that Mr Donald&s;on &s;hould make a di&s;tinct publication of them; as they will, by this means, be better known, and con&s;equently more univer&s;ally applied to u&s;e by every reader of any di&s;cernment.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16">
I CANNOT conclude without an eulogium upon the ju&s;tne&s;s and propriety of that line, when, draw|ing to a clo&s;e, he exclaims, with all the rapture and poetic fury of the Pythian prie&s;te&s;s,
<Q><L><HI>I cea&s;e, I cea&s;e the empty lay.</HI></L></Q>
I am per&s;uaded no human mortal can po&s;&s;ibly read this without a con&s;cious home-felt &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I HAVE now tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed too long on your patience, &s;o &s;hall break off with a&s;&s;uring you that I am</P>

<L>How often did our foot&s;teps &s;tray</L>
<L>O'er the gay banks of &s;ilver Clyde,</L>
<L>Where Nature's native charms re&s;ide.</L>
<L>Oft-times in the enamell'd mead,</L>
<L>Or &s;eated in a leafy &s;hade,</L>
<L>Sweet poetry our &s;en&s;es charm'd,</L>
<L>And our imaginations warm'd;</L>
<L>What time in WILKIE'S flowing &s;trains,</L>
<L>WILKIE the HOMER of our plains,</L>
<L>We view'd the fair Aetolian maid,</L>
<L>By love, by too fond love betray'd.</L>
<L>Love too did oft our &s;peech employ,</L>
<L>Love the pure &s;ource of &s;ocial joy:</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="22">
Love&mdash;but what vi&s;ions &s;trike mine eyes!</L>
<L>What forms, what heav'nly forms ari&s;e?</L>
<L>AMMONIA here!&mdash;ah me! excu&s;e</L>
<L>The &s;allies of a wanton mu&s;e,</L>
<L>That flies on fancy's wing away.</L>
<L>I cea&s;e,&mdash;I cea&s;e the empty lay.</L>
<L>Farewell, my friend.&mdash;Ye zephyrs bear</L>
<L>My wi&s;hes to MENALCAS' ear.</L>
