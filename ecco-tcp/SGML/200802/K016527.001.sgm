<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor of the following Letters takes Leave to ob&s;erve, that he has now, in this Publication, completed the Plan, that was the Object of his Wi&s;hes, rather than of his Hopes, to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>How &s;uch remarkable Collections of pri|vate Letters fell into his Hands, he hopes the Reader will not think it very nece&s;&s;ary to enquire.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Collection, intitled PAMELA, exhibited the Beauty and Superiority of Virtue in an Innocent and unpoli&s;hed Mind, with the Reward which often, even in this Life, a pro|tecting Providence be&s;tows on Goodne&s;s. A young Woman of low Degree, relating to
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
her hone&s;t Parents the &s;evere Trials &s;he met with from a Ma&s;ter who ought to have been the Protector, not the A&s;&s;ailer, of her Honour, &s;hews the Character of a Libertine in its truly contemptible Light. This Libertine, however, from the Foundation of good Principles laid in his early Years by an excellent Mother; by his Pa&s;&s;ion for a virtuous young Woman; and by her amiable Example, and unwearied Patience, when &s;he became his Wife; is, after a Length of Time, perfectly reclaimed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Collection, publi&s;hed under the Title of CLARISSA, di&s;played a more melancholy Scene. A young Lady of higher Fortune, and born to happier Hopes, is &s;een involved in &s;uch Variety of deep Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, as lead her to an untimely Death; affording a Warning to Parents again&s;t forcing the Inclina|tions of their Children in the mo&s;t important Article of their Lives; and to Children again&s;t hoping too far from the faire&s;t A&s;&s;urances of a Man void of Principle. The Heroine, how|ever, as a truly <HI>Chri&s;tian Heroine,</HI> proves &s;upe|rior to her Trials; and her Heart, always ex|cellent, refined and exalted by every one of them, rejoices in the Approach of a happy Eternity. Her cruel De&s;troyer appears wretch|ed and di&s;appointed, even in the boa&s;ted Suc|ce&s;s
<PB N="v" REF="4">
of his vile Machinations: But &s;till (buoyed up with Self-conceit and vain Pre&s;umption) he goes on, after every &s;hort Fit of imperfect, yet terrifying Conviction, hardening him&s;elf more and more; till, unreclaimed by the mo&s;t affect|ing Warnings, and repeated Admonitions, he peri&s;hes mi&s;erably in the Bloom of Life, and &s;inks into the Grave oppre&s;&s;ed with Guilt, Re|mor&s;e, and Horror. His Letters, it is hoped, afford many u&s;eful Le&s;&s;ons to the gay Part of Mankind again&s;t that Mi&s;u&s;e of Wit and Youth, of Rank and Fortune, and of every outward Accompli&s;hment, which turns them into a Cur&s;e to the mi&s;erable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as well as to all around them.</P>
<P>Here the Editor apprehended he &s;hould be obliged to &s;top, by rea&s;on of his precarious State of Health, and a Variety of Avocations which claimed his fir&s;t Attention: But it was in&s;i&s;ted on by &s;everal of his Friends who were well a&s;&s;ured he had the Materials in his Power, that he &s;hould produce into public View the Character and Actions of a Man of TRUE HONOUR.</P>
<P>He has been enabled to obey the&s;e his Friends, and to complete his fir&s;t De&s;ign: And now, therefore, pre&s;ents to the Public, in Sir
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
CHARLES GRANDISON, the Example of a Man acting uniformly well thro' a Variety of trying Scenes, becau&s;e all his Actions are re|gulated by one &s;teady Principle: A Man of Religion and Virtue; of Liveline&s;s, and Spi|rit; accompli&s;hed and agreeable; happy in him&s;elf, and a Ble&s;&s;ing to others.</P>
<P>From what has been premi&s;ed, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the pre&s;ent Collection is not pub|li&s;hed ultimately, nor even principally, any more than the other two, for the Sake of En|tertainment only. A much nobler End is in View. Yet it is hoped the Variety of Charac|ters and Conver&s;ations nece&s;&s;arily introduced into &s;o large a Corre&s;pondence, as the&s;e Vo|lumes contain, will enliven as well as in&s;truct: The rather, as the principal Corre&s;pondents are young Ladies of polite Education, and of lively Spirits.</P>
<P>The Nature of familiar Letters, written, as it were, to the <HI>Moment,</HI> while the Heart is agi|tated by Hopes and Fears, on Events undecided, mu&s;t plead an Excu&s;e for the Bulk of a Col|lection of this Kind. Mere Facts and Charac|ters might be compri&s;ed in a much &s;maller Compa&s;s: But, would they be equally intere&s;t|ing? It happens fortunately, that an Account
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
of the juvenile Years of the principal Per&s;on is narratively given in &s;ome of the Letters. As many, however, as could be &s;pared, have been omitted. There is not one Epi&s;ode in the Whole; nor, after Sir CHARLES GRANDISON is introduced, one Letter in&s;erted, but what tends to illu&s;trate the principal De&s;ign. Tho&s;e which precede his Introduction, will not, it is hoped, be judged unnece&s;&s;ary on the Whole, as they tend to make the Reader acquainted with Per&s;ons, the Hi&s;tory of whom is clo&s;ely inter|woven with that of Sir Charles.</P>

<P>YOUR re&s;olution to accompany Mrs. Reeves to London, has greatly alarmed your three Lovers. And two of them, at lea&s;t, will let you know that it has. Such a lovely girl as my Harriet, mu&s;t expect to be more accountable for her &s;teps than one le&s;s excellent and le&s;s attractive.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, in his u&s;ual re&s;olute way, threatens to follow you to London; and there, he &s;ays, he will watch the motions of every man who approaches you; and, if he find rea&s;on for it, will <HI>early</HI> let &s;uch man know <HI>his</HI> preten&s;ions, and the danger he may run into, if he pretend to be his competitor. But let me not do him inju&s;tice; though he talks of a rival thus har&s;hly, he &s;peaks of you more highly than man ever &s;poke of woman. Angel and Godde&s;s are phra&s;es you have been u&s;ed to from him; and tho' &s;poken in
<PB N="2" REF="9">
his humorous way, yet I am &s;ure he mo&s;t &s;incerely admires you.</P>
<P>Mr. Fenwick, in a le&s;s determined manner, de|clares, that he will follow you to town, if you &s;tay there above <HI>one</HI> fortnight.</P>
<P>The gentle Orme &s;ighs his apprehen&s;ions, and wi&s;hes you would change your purpo&s;e. Tho' hope|le&s;s, he &s;ays, it is &s;ome plea&s;ure to him, that he can think him&s;elf in the &s;ame county with you; and much more, that he can tread in your foot&s;teps to and from church every Sunday, and behold you there. He wonders how your grandmamma, your aunt, your uncle, can &s;pare you. Your cou&s;in Reeves's &s;urely, he &s;ays, are very happy in their influences over us all.</P>
<P>Each of the gentlemen is afraid, that by increa&s;ing the number of your admirers, you will increa&s;e his difficulties: But what is that to them, I a&s;ked, when they already know, that you are not inclined to fa|vour any of the three?</P>
<P>If you hold your re&s;olution, and my cou&s;in Reeves's their time of &s;etting out, pray let me know, and I will attend you at my uncle Selby's, to wi&s;h you a good journey, much plea&s;ure in town, and a re|turn with a &s;afe and &s;ound heart. My &s;i&s;ter, who, poor dear girl, continues extremely weak and low, will &s;pare me for a purpo&s;e &s;o indi&s;pen&s;able. I will not have you come to <HI>us.</HI> I know it would grieve you to &s;ee her in the way &s;he is in. You too much take to heart the infirmities of your friends which you cannot cure; and as your grandmamma lives upon your &s;miles, and you rejoice all your friends by your chearfulne&s;s, it would be cruel to make you &s;ad.</P>
<P>MR. GREVILLE has ju&s;t left us. He dropt in upon us as we were going to dinner. My grand|mother Selby you know is always plea&s;ed with his rat|tling. She prevailed on him to alight, and &s;it down with us. All his talk was of you. He repeated his
<PB N="3" REF="10">
former <HI>threatenings</HI> (as I called them to him) on your going to town. After dinner, he read us a Letter from Lady Frampton relating to you. He read us al&s;o &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from the copy of his an&s;wer, with de&s;ign, I believe, that I &s;hould a&s;k him to leave it behind him. He is a vain creature, you know, and &s;eemed fond of what he had written. I <HI>did</HI> a&s;k him. He pretended to make a &s;cruple of <HI>your</HI> &s;eeing it; but it was a faint one. However he called for pen and ink; and when it was brought him, &s;cratched o|ver two pa&s;&s;ages, and that with &s;o many little flou|ri&s;hes (as you will &s;ee) that he thought they could not be read. But the ink I furni&s;hed him with hap|pening to be paler than his, you will find he was not cunning enough. I promi&s;ed to return it.</P>
<P>Send me a line by the bearer, to tell me if your re&s;olution holds as to the day.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t Harriet. May angels protect and guide you whither&s;oever you go!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. Mr. <HI>GREVILLE,</HI> To Lady <HI>FRAMPTON.</HI> Inclo&s;ed in the preceding.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Northampton,</HI> <DATE><HI>January 6.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Lady&s;hip demands a de&s;cription of the Per&s;on of the celebrated Mi&s;s Byron in our neighbourhood; and to know, whether, as report tells you, Love has li&s;ted me in the number of her par|ticular admirers?&mdash;<HI>Particular</HI> admirers you well di|&s;tingui&s;h; &s;ince every one who beholds her admires her.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip confines your enquiries to her <HI>Per|&s;on,</HI> you tell me; and you own, that women are much more &s;olicitous about the beauties of <HI>that,</HI> than of the <HI>Mind.</HI> Perhaps it may be &s;o; and that their envy is much &s;ooner excited by the one than by the others
<PB N="4" REF="11">
But who, madam, can de&s;cribe the per&s;on of Mi&s;s Harriet Byron, and her per&s;on only; animated as every feature is by a mind that be&s;peaks all human excellence, and dignifies her in every Air, in every Look, in every Motion?</P>
<P>No man living has a greater pa&s;&s;ion for beauty than I have. Till I knew Mi&s;s Byron, I was one of tho&s;e who regarded nothing el&s;e in the Sex. Indeed, I con|&s;idered all intellectual attainments as either u&s;ele&s;s or impertinent in women. Your Lady&s;hip knows what were my free notions on this head, and has rebuked me for them. A wi&s;e and learned Lady, I con&s;idered as a very unnatural character. I wanted women to be all Love, and nothing el&s;e. A <HI>very</HI> little Prudence allow'd I to enter into their compo|&s;ition; ju&s;t enough to di&s;tingui&s;h the Man of Sen&s;e from the Fool; and that for my <HI>own</HI> &s;ake: You know I have vanity, madam: But lovely as Mi&s;s By|ron's per&s;on is, I defy the greate&s;t Sen&s;uali&s;t on earth not to admire her mind more than her per&s;on. What a triumph would the devil have, as I have often thought, when I have &s;tood contemplating her per|fections, e&s;pecially at church, were he able to rai&s;e up a man that could lower this Angel into Woman?&mdash;Pardon me!&mdash;Your Lady&s;hip knows my mad way of &s;aying every thing that ri&s;es to my thoughts.</P>
<P>Sweetne&s;s of temper mu&s;t make plain featuresglow: What an effect mu&s;t it then have upon fine ones? Never <HI>was</HI> there a &s;weeter-temper'd woman. Indeed from Sixteen to Twenty, all the Sex (kept in humour by their hopes, and by their attractions) are <HI>&s;aid</HI> to be good-temper'd; but &s;he is remarkably &s;o. She is ju&s;t turned of Twenty, but looks not more than Seven|teen. Her beauty, hardly yet in its full blow, will la&s;t longer, I imagine, than in an earlier blo&s;&s;om. Yet the prudence vi&s;ible in her whole a&s;pect, gave her a di&s;tinction, even at Twelve, that promi&s;ed, what &s;he would be at a riper age.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="12">
Yet with all this reigning good-nature vi&s;ible in her face and manner, there is &s;uch a native dignity in all &s;he &s;ays, in all &s;he does (tho' mingled with a frankne&s;s that &s;hews her mind's &s;uperiority to the minds of almo&s;t all other women) that it damps and &s;uppre&s;&s;es, in the mo&s;t audacious, all imaginations of bold familiarity.</P>
<P>I know not, by my &s;oul, how &s;he does this nei|ther: But &s;o it is. She je&s;ts; &s;he rallies: But I can|not rally her again. Love, it is &s;aid, dignifies the adored object. Perhaps it is <HI>that</HI> which awes me.</P>
<P>And now will your Lady&s;hip doubt of an affirma|tive an&s;wer to your &s;econd que&s;tion, Whether Love has li&s;ted me in the number of her particular admi|rers?</P>
<P>He has: And the devil take me if I can help my|&s;elf: And yet I have no encouragement&mdash;Nor any body el&s;e; that's my con&s;olation. Fenwick is deeper in, if po&s;&s;ible, than I. We had at our fir&s;t acquaint|ance, as you have heard, a tilting-bout on the occa&s;i|on: But are &s;worn friends now; each having agreed to try his fortune by patience and per&s;everance; and being a&s;&s;ured that the one has no more of her favour to boa&s;t of than the other <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The pa&s;&s;ages in this Letter thus mark'd ("), are tho&s;e which in the preceding one, are &s;aid to be &s;cratched out; and yet were legible by holding up the Letter to the light.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have indeed blu&s;tered away between us half a &s;corce more of her admirers. Poor whining Orme, however, per|&s;everes. But of him we make no account: He has a watry head, and tho' he finds a way, by his &s;i&s;ter, who vi&s;its at Mr. Selby's, and is much e&s;teemed there, to let Mi&s;s Byron know his pa&s;|&s;ion for her, notwith&s;tanding the negative he has received; yet doubt we not, that &s;he is &s;afe from a flame that he will quench with his tears, before it can ri&s;e to an head to di&s;turb us.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You Ladies love men &s;hould whine after you: But never yet did I find, that where a blu&s;tering fellow was a competitor, the Lady married the milk&s;op."</Q></P>
<P>But let me in this particular do Mi&s;s Byron ju&s;tice: How &s;he manages it, I can't tell; but &s;he is cour|teous to all: nor could ever any man charge her either with pride or cruelty. All I fear, is, that &s;he has &s;uch an equality in her temper, that &s;he can hardly find room in her heart for a particular Love: Nor will, till &s;he meets with one who&s;e mind is near as faultle&s;s as her own; and the general tenor of who&s;e life and actions calls upon her di&s;cretion to give her <HI>leave</HI> to love. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This apprehen&s;ion I owe to a con|ver&s;ation I had with her grandmother Shirley; a Lady that is an ornament to old age; and who hinted to me, that her grand-daughter had excep|tions both to Fenwick and me, on the &s;core of a <HI>few</HI> indulgences that perhaps have been <HI>too</HI> public; but which all men of fa&s;hion and &s;pirit give them|&s;elves, and all women, but <HI>this,</HI> allow of, or hate not men the wor&s;e for. But then what is her ob|jection to Orme? He is a &s;ober dog."</Q></P>
<P>She was but eight years old when her mother died. <HI>She</HI> al&s;o was an excellent woman. Her death was brought on by grief for that of her hu&s;band; which happened but &s;ix months before&mdash;A rare in&s;tance!</P>
<P>The grandmother and aunt, to whom the girl is dutiful to a proverb, will not interfere with her choice. If <HI>they</HI> are applied to for their intere&s;t, the an&s;wer is con&s;tantly this: The approbation of their Harriet mu&s;t fir&s;t be gained, and then their con&s;ent is ready.</P>
<P>There is a Mr. Deane, a man of an excellent cha|racter for a Lawyer; but indeed he left off practice on coming into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an hand&s;ome e&s;tate: He was the girl's godfather. He is allowed to have great influence over them all. Harriet calls him papa.
<PB N="7" REF="14">
To him I have applied: But his an&s;wer is the very &s;ame: His <HI>daughter</HI> Harriet mu&s;t choo&s;e for her&s;elf: All motions of this kind mu&s;t come fir&s;t from her.</P>
<P>And ought I to de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding with the girl <HI>her&s;elf?</HI> I, her Greville! not contemptible in per&s;on; in air&mdash;free and ea&s;y, <HI>at lea&s;t;</HI> having a good e&s;tate in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; fine expectances be&s;ides; dre&s;&s;ing well, &s;inging well, dancing well, and ble&s;t with a moderate &s;hare of confidence; which makes <HI>other</HI> women think me a clever fellow: She a girl of twenty; her fortune between ten and fifteen thou&s;and pounds on|ly; for her father's con&s;iderable e&s;tate, on his demi&s;e, for want of male heirs, went with the name: Her grandmother's jointure not more than 500<HI>l.</HI> a year&mdash;And what though her uncle Selby has no chil|dren, and loves her, yet has he nephews and nieces of his own, whom he al&s;o loves; for this Harriet is his wife's niece.</P>
<P>I will <HI>not</HI> de&s;pair. If re&s;olution, if per&s;everance, will do, and if &s;he be a woman, &s;he &s;hall be mine&mdash;And &s;o I have told her aunt Selby, and her un|cle too; and &s;o I have told Mi&s;s Lucy Selby, her cou&s;in, as &s;he calls her, who is highly and de&s;ervedly in her favour; and &s;o indeed have I more than once told the girl her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But now to the de&s;cription of her per&s;on&mdash;Let me die, if I know where to begin. She is all over love|line&s;s. Does not every body el&s;e who has &s;een her, tell you &s;o? Her Stature; &s;hall I begin with her &s;ta|ture? She cannot be &s;aid to be tall; but yet is &s;ome|thing above the middling. Her Shape&mdash;But what care I for her &s;hape? I, who hope to love her &s;till more, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion may make me admire her le&s;s, when &s;he has not that to boa&s;t of? We young fellows who have been abroad, are above regarding Engli&s;h &s;hapes, and prefer to them the French negligence. By the way, I think the foreign Ladies in the right, that they aim not at what they cannot attain. Whe|ther

<HI>we</HI> are &s;o much in the right to come into their ta&s;te, is another thing. But be this as it will, there is &s;o much ea&s;e and dignity in the per&s;on, in the dre&s;s, and in every air and motion of Mi&s;s Harriet Byron, that fine &s;hapes will ever be in fa&s;hion where &s;he is, be either native or foreigner the judge.</P>
<P>Her complexion is admirably fair and clear. I have &s;at admiring her complexion, till I have imagined I have &s;een the life-blood &s;lowing with equal cour&s;e thro' her tran&s;lucent veins.</P>
<P>Her Forehead, &s;o nobly free and open, &s;hews dig|nity and mode&s;ty, and &s;trikes into one a kind of <HI>awe,</HI> &s;ingly contemplated, that (from the <HI>delight</HI> which ac|companies the <HI>awe)</HI> I know not how to de&s;cribe. Every &s;ingle feature, in &s;hort, will bear the nice&s;t ex|amination; and her whole Face, and her Neck, &s;o admirably &s;et on her finely-proportioned Shoulders&mdash;let me peri&s;h, if, taking all together, I do not hold her to be the mo&s;t unexceptionable beauty I ever beheld. But what &s;till is her <HI>particular</HI> Excellence, and di&s;tingui&s;hes her from all other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> women (for it mu&s;t be acknowleged to be a characteri&s;tic of the French women of quality) is, the grace which that people call <HI>Phy&s;iognomy,</HI> and we may call <HI>Ex|pre&s;&s;ion:</HI> Had <HI>not</HI> her &s;eatures and her complexion been &s;o fine as they are, that grace alone, that Soul &s;hining out in her lovely a&s;pect, joined with the ea&s;e and gracefulne&s;s of her Motion, would have made her as many admirers, as beholders.</P>
<P>After this, &s;hall I de&s;cend to a more particular de|&s;cription?&mdash;I will.</P>
<P>Her Cheek&mdash;I never <HI>&s;aw</HI> a cheek &s;o beautifully turn'd; illu&s;trated, as it is, by a charming Carmine flu&s;h, which denotes &s;ound health. A mo&s;t bewitch|ing dimple takes place in each, when &s;he &s;miles; and &s;he has &s;o much rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with her&s;elf, and with all about her (for &s;he is the idol of her rela|tions) that I believe from infancy, &s;he never frowned;
<PB N="9" REF="16">
nor can a frown, it is my opinion, &s;it upon her face for a minute. Would to heaven I were con&s;iderable enough with her to prove the contrary!</P>
<P>Her Mouth&mdash;There never <HI>was</HI> &s;o lovely a mouth. But no wonder; &s;ince &s;uch ro&s;y Lips, and &s;uch ivory and even Teeth, mu&s;t give beauty to a mouth le&s;s charming than hers.</P>
<P>Her No&s;e adds dignity to her other features. Her Chin is &s;weetly turned, and almo&s;t imperceptibly dimpled.</P>
<P>Her Eyes!&mdash;Ay, madam, her Eyes!&mdash;Good Hea|ven! what a lu&s;tre; yet not a fierce, but a mild lu&s;tre! How have I de&s;pi&s;ed the romancing Poets for their unnatural de&s;criptions of the Eyes of their heroines! But I have thought tho&s;e de&s;criptions, tho' ab&s;urd enough in con&s;cience, le&s;s ab&s;urd (allowing &s;ome|thing for poetical licence) ever &s;ince I beheld tho&s;e of Mi&s;s Harriet Byron.</P>
<P>Her Hair is a real and unlaboured ornament to her. All natural its curls: Art has no &s;hare in the lu&s;tre it gives to her other beauties.</P>
<P>I mentioned her Neck&mdash;Here I dare not tru&s;t my|&s;elf&mdash;Inimitable creature! All-attracting loveline&s;s!</P>
<P>Her Arm&mdash;Your Lady&s;hip knows my pa&s;&s;ion for a delicate Arm.&mdash;By my Soul, madam, your own does not exceed it.</P>
<P>Her Hands are extremely fine. Such Fingers! And they accu&s;tomed to the Pen, to the Needle, to the Harp&s;ichord; excelling in all&mdash;O madam! wo|men <HI>have</HI> Souls. I am now convinced they have.

learning, and, from his public employments abroad, as polite as learned. This Girl, from Seven years of age, when he came to &s;ettle in England, to Fourteen, when &s;he lo&s;t him, was his delight; and her educa|tion and in&s;truction the amu&s;ement of his vacant hours. This is the Period, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, in which the foundations of all female goodne&s;s are to be laid, &s;ince &s;o &s;oon after Fourteen they leap into women.</P>
<P>The dead languages he aimed not to teach her, le&s;t he &s;hould overload her young mind: But in the Italian and French he made her an adept.</P>
<P>Nor were the advantages common ones which &s;he received from his Lady, her grandmother, and from her aunt Selby, her father's &s;i&s;ter, a woman of equal worthine&s;s.

<P>I Return you inclo&s;ed, my Lucy, Mr. Greville's &s;trange Letter. As you a&s;ked him for it, he will have no doubt but you &s;hewed it to me. It is better therefore, if he make enquiry whether you did or not, to own it. In this ca&s;e he will be curious to know my &s;entiments upon it. He is &s;en&s;ible that my whole heart is open to you.</P>
<P>Tell him, if you think proper, in &s;o many words, that I am far more di&s;plea&s;ed with him for his impe|tuo&s;ity, than gratified by his flattery.</P>
<P>Tell him, that I think it very hard, that, when my neare&s;t relations leave me &s;o generou&s;ly to my liberty, a man, to whom I never gave cau&s;e to treat me with di&s;re&s;pect, &s;hould take upon him&s;elf to threaten and controul me.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="19">
A&s;k him, What are his pretences for following me to London, or el&s;ewhere?</P>
<P>If I had not had rea&s;ons <HI>before</HI> to avoid a more than neighbourly civility to him, he has now furni&s;hed me with very &s;trong ones. The threatening Lover mu&s;t certainly make a tyrant Hu&s;band. Don't you think &s;o, Lucy?&mdash;But make not &s;uppo&s;als of Lover, or Hu&s;band to him: The&s;e bold men will turn &s;hadows into &s;ub&s;tance, in their own favour.</P>
<P>A woman who is &s;o much exalted above what &s;he <HI>can</HI> de&s;erve, has rea&s;on to be terrified, were &s;he to marry the complimenter (even <HI>could</HI> &s;he &s;uppo&s;e him &s;o blinded by his pa&s;&s;ion as not to be ab&s;olutely in|&s;incere) to think of the height &s;he mu&s;t fall from, in his opinion, when &s;he has put it into his power to treat her but as what &s;he is.</P>
<P>Indeed I both <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> and <HI>fear</HI> a very high compli|menter.&mdash;<HI>De&s;pi&s;e</HI> him for his de&s;igning flattery, &s;up|po&s;ing him not to believe him&s;elf; or, if he <HI>mean</HI> what he &s;ays, for his injudiciou&s;ne&s;s. I <HI>fear</HI> him, le&s;t he &s;hould (as in the former ca&s;e he mu&s;t hope) be able to rai&s;e a vanity in me, that would &s;ink me be|neath his meanne&s;s, and give him cau&s;e to triumph over my folly, at the very time that I am full of my own wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>High-&s;train'd compliments, in &s;hort, always pull me down; always make me &s;hrink into <HI>my&s;elf.</HI> Have I not &s;ome vanity to guard again&s;t? I have no doubt but Mr. Greville wi&s;hed I &s;hould &s;ee this Letter: And this gives me &s;ome little indignation again&s;t <HI>my|&s;elf;</HI> for does it not look as if, from &s;ome faults in my conduct, Mr. Greville had formed hopes of &s;uc|ceeding, by treating me like a fool?</P>
<P>I hope the&s;e gentlemen will not follow me to town, as they threaten. If they do, I will not &s;ee them, if I can any way avoid it. Yet, for me to appear to <HI>them</HI> &s;olicitous on this head, or to de&s;ire them <HI>not</HI> to go, will be in &s;ome mea&s;ure to lay my&s;elf under an obligation to

their acquie&s;cence. It is not therefore for me to hope to influence them in this matter; &s;ince they expect too much in return for it from me; and &s;ince they will be ready to found a merit in their pa&s;&s;ion, even for di&s;|obliging me.</P>
<P>I cannot bear, however, to think of their dangling after me where-ever I go. The&s;e men, my dear, were we to give them importance with us, would be greater infringers of our natural freedom than the mo&s;t &s;evere Parents; and for <HI>their own &s;akes:</HI> Where|as Parents, if ever &s;o de&s;potic (if not unnatural ones indeed) mean <HI>&s;olely our good,</HI> tho' head&s;trong girls do not always think &s;o. Yet &s;uch, even <HI>&s;uch,</HI> can be teazed out of their wills, at lea&s;t out of their duty, by the men who &s;tile them&s;elves <HI>Lovers,</HI> when they are invincible to all the entreaties and commands of their <HI>Parents.</HI></P>
<P>O that the next eight or ten years of my life, if I find not in the interim a man, on whom my whole undivided heart can fix, were happily over! As hap|pily as the la&s;t alike important four years! To be able to look down from the <HI>elevation</HI> of thirty years, my principles fix'd, and to have no capital folly to re|proach my&s;elf with, what an happine&s;s would that be!</P>
<P>My Cou&s;in Reeves's time of &s;etting out holds; the indulgence of my deare&s;t Friends continues; and my re&s;olution holds. But I will &s;ee my Nancy before I &s;et out. What! &s;hall I enter upon a party of plea|&s;ure, and leave in my heart room to reflect, in the mid&s;t of it, that there is a dear &s;uffering friend who had rea&s;on to think I was afraid of giving my&s;elf pain, when I might, by the balm of true love and friendly &s;oothings, admini&s;ter comfort to her wounded heart?&mdash;No, my Lucy, believe me, if I have not genero&s;ity enough, I have <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> enough, to make me avoid a &s;ting &s;o &s;evere as <HI>this</HI> would be, to</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Gro&s;venor-Street,</HI> <DATE><HI>Tue&s;day, Jan. 24.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE are ju&s;t arrived. We had a very agreeable journey.</P>
<P>I need not tell you that Mr. Greville and Mr. Fen|wick attended us to our fir&s;t baiting; and had a gen|teel dinner ready provided for us: The gentlemen will tell you this, and all particulars.</P>
<P>They both renewed their menaces of following me to London, if I &s;tay'd above one month. They were &s;o good as to &s;tretch their fortnight to a month.</P>
<P>Mr. Fenwick, in very pathetic terms, as he found an opportunity to engage me alone for a few minutes, be&s;ought me to <HI>love</HI> him. Mr. Greville was as earne&s;t with me to declare, that I <HI>hated</HI> him. Such a de|claration, he &s;aid, was all he at pre&s;ent wi&s;hed for. It was &s;trange, he told me, that he neither could prevail on me to encourage his Love, nor to declare my Hatred. He is a whim&s;ical creature.</P>
<P>I rallied him with my u&s;ual freedom; and told him, that if there was one per&s;on in the world that I was capable of hating, I could make the le&s;s &s;cruple to oblige <HI>him.</HI> He thank'd me for that.</P>
<P>The two gentlemen would fain have proceeded farther: But as they are never out of their way, I dare &s;ay, they would have gone to London; and there have dangled on till we &s;hould not have got rid of them, for my whole time of being in town.</P>
<P>I was very gravely earne&s;t with them to leave us, when we &s;tept into the coach in order to proceed. Fenwick, you dog, &s;aid Mr. Greville, we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> re|turn; Mi&s;s Byron looks grave. Gravity, and a ri&s;ing colour in the fine&s;t face in the world, indicates as much as the frowns of other Beauties. And in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner they both took leave of me;
<PB N="15" REF="22">
in&s;i&s;ting, however, on my hand, and that I would wi&s;h them well.</P>
<P>I gave each my hand; I wi&s;h you very well, gen|tlemen, &s;aid I: And I am obliged to your civility in &s;eeing me &s;o far on my journey: E&s;pecially as you are &s;o kind as to leave me here.</P>
<P>Why, dear Madam, did you not &s;pare your <HI>E&s;pe|cially,</HI> &s;aid Mr. Greville?&mdash;Come, Fenwick, let us re|tire, and lay our two loggerheads together, and live over again the pa&s;t hour, and then hang our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Orme! The coach, at our fir&s;t &s;etting out, pa&s;&s;ed by his Park-gate, you know. There was he&mdash;on the very ridge of the highway. I &s;aw him not till it was near him. He bowed to the very ground, with <HI>&s;uch</HI> an air of di&s;con&s;olatene&s;s!&mdash;Poor Mr. Orme!&mdash;I wi&s;h'd to have &s;aid one word to him, when we had pa&s;&s;ed him: But the coach flew&mdash;Why did the coach fly?&mdash;But I waved my hand, and leaned out of the coach as far as I could, and bowed to him.</P>
<P>O Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid Mrs. Reeves (&s;o &s;aid Mr. Reeves) Mr. Orme is the happy man. Did I think as you do, &s;aid I, I &s;hould not be &s;o de&s;irous to have &s;poken to him: But, methinks, I &s;hould have been glad to have once &s;aid, Adieu, Mr. Orme; for Mr. Orme is a good man.</P>
<P>But, Lucy, my heart was &s;oftened at parting with my dear relations and friends; and when the heart is &s;oftened, light impre&s;&s;ions will go deep.</P>
<P>My cou&s;ins hou&s;e is &s;uitable to their fortune: Very hand&s;ome, and furni&s;hed in ta&s;te. Mrs. Reeves, knowing well what a &s;cribbler I am, and am expected to be, has provided me with pen, ink, and paper, in abundance. She readily allowed me to take early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my apartment, that I might pay punctual obedience to the commands of all my friends on &s;et|ting out. The&s;e, you know, were, to write in the
<PB N="16" REF="23">
fir&s;t hour of my arrival: And it was allowed to be to you, my dear. But, writing thus early, what can have occurred?</P>
<P>My apartment is extremely elegant. A well-fur|ni&s;h'd book-ca&s;e, is, however, to me the mo&s;t attract|ing ornament in it&mdash;Pardon me, dear Pen and Ink! I mu&s;t not prefer any thing to you, by who&s;e means, I hope to &s;pend &s;ome part of every day at Selby-Hou&s;e; and even at this di&s;tance, amu&s;e with my prat|tle tho&s;e friends that are always &s;o partial to it.</P>
<P>And now, my dear, my revered grandmamma, I a&s;k your ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;Yours, my ever-indulgent aunt Selby&mdash;And yours, my honoured and equally beloved uncle Selby. Who knows but you will, now in ab&s;ence, take le&s;s delight in teazing your ever-dutiful Harriet? But yet I unbe&s;peak not my monitor.</P>
<P>Continue to love me, my Lucy, as I &s;hall endea|vour to de&s;erve your Love: And let me know how our dear Nancy does.</P>
<P>My heart bleeds for her. I &s;hould have held my|&s;elf utterly inexcu&s;able, had I accepted of your kind|ly-intended di&s;pen&s;ation, and come to town for three whole months, without repeating to her, by word of mouth, my Love, and my &s;ympathi&s;ing concern for her. What merit does her patience add to her other merits! How has her calamity endeared her to me! If ever I &s;hall be heavily afflicted, God give me her amiable, her almo&s;t meritorious patience in &s;ufferings!</P>

<P>YOU rejoice me, my dear, in the hopes which you tell me, Dr. Mitchell from London gives
<PB N="17" REF="24">
you in relation to our Nancy. May our ince&s;&s;ant prayers for the re&s;toration of her health be an&s;wered!</P>
<P>Three things my aunt Selby, and you, in the name of every one of my friends, enjoined me at parting. The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> To write often, <HI>very</HI> often, were <HI>your</HI> words. This injunction was not needful: My heart is with you; and the good news you give me of my grand|mamma's health, and of our Nancy, enlarges that heart. The <HI>&s;econd,</HI> to give you a de&s;cription of the per&s;ons and characters of the people, I am likely to be conver&s;ant with in this great town. And, <HI>thirdly,</HI> Be|&s;ides the general account which you all expected from me of the vi&s;its I made and received, you enjoined me to accquaint you with the very <HI>beginnings</HI> of every ad|dre&s;s (and even of every <HI>&s;ilent and re&s;pectful</HI> di&s;tincti|on, were <HI>your</HI> words) that the girl whom you all &s;o greatly favour, might receive on this excur&s;ion to town.</P>
<P>Don't you remember what my uncle Selby an&s;wer'd to this?&mdash;<HI>I</HI> do: And will repeat it, to &s;hew, that his correcting cautions &s;hall not be forgotten.</P>
<P>The vanity of the Sex, &s;aid he, will not &s;uffer any thing of this &s;ort to e&s;cape our Harriet. Women, continued he, make them&s;elves &s;o cheap at the public places, in and about town, that new faces are more enquired after than even fine faces con&s;tantly &s;een. Harriet has an hone&s;t artle&s;s bloom in her cheeks; &s;he may attract notice as a novice: But wherefore do you fill her head with an expectation of conque&s;ts? Women, added he, offer them&s;elves at every pub|lic place, in rows, as at a market. Becau&s;e three or four &s;illy fellows here in the country (like people at an auction, who rai&s;e the price upon each other above its value) have bid for her, you think &s;he will not be able to &s;et her foot out of doors, without increa&s;ing the number of her followers.</P>
<P>And then my uncle would have it, that my head would be unable to bear the <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> which the partiality of my other friends gave me.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="25">
It is true, my Lucy, that we young women are too apt to be plea&s;ed with the admiration <HI>pretended</HI> for us by the other Sex. But I have always endeavour'd to keep down any fooli&s;h pride of this &s;ort, by &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e: That flattery is the vice of men: That they &s;eek to rai&s;e us, in order to lower us, and in the end to exalt them&s;elves on the ruins of the pride they either hope to find or in&s;pire: That hu|mility, as it &s;hines brighte&s;t in an high condition, be&s;t becomes a flattered woman of all women: That &s;he who is puffed up by the prai&s;es of men, on the &s;up|po&s;ed advantages of per&s;on, an&s;wers <HI>their end</HI> upon her; and &s;eems to own, that &s;he thinks it a principal part of <HI>hers,</HI> to be admired by them: And what can give more importance to them, and le&s;s to her&s;elf, than this? For have not women &s;ouls as well as men, and &s;ouls as capable of the noble&s;t attainments, as theirs? Shall they not, therefore, be mo&s;t &s;olicitous to cultivate the beauties of the mind, and to make tho&s;e of per&s;on but of inferior con&s;ideration? The bloom of beauty holds but a very few years; and &s;hall not a woman aim to make her&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e per|fections that will dignify her advanced age? And then may &s;he be as wi&s;e, as venerable&mdash;as my grand|mamma. <HI>She</HI> is an example for us, my dear: Who is &s;o much re&s;pected, who is &s;o much beloved, both by old and young, as my grandmamma Shirley?</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the &s;econd injunction, I will now de|&s;cribe &s;ome young ladies and gentlemen who paid my cou&s;ins their compliments on their arrival in town.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Alle&s;tree, daughter of Sir John Alle&s;tree, was one. She is very pretty, and very genteel, ea&s;y, and free. I believe I &s;hall love her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bramber was the &s;econd. Not &s;o pretty as Mi&s;s Alle&s;tree; but agreeable in her per&s;on and air; a little too talkative, I think.</P>
<P>It was one of my grandfather's rules to me, Not impertinently to &s;tart &s;ubjects, as if I would make an
<PB N="19" REF="26">
o&s;tentation of knowledge; or as if I were fond of in|dulging a talking humour: But frankne&s;s and com|plai&s;ance required, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that we women &s;hould unlock our bo&s;oms, when we were called upon, and were expected to give our &s;entiments upon any &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Bramber was <HI>eager</HI> to talk. She &s;eemed, even when &s;ilent, to look as if &s;he was &s;tudying for &s;omething to &s;ay, altho' &s;he had exhau&s;ted two or three &s;ubjects. This charge of volubility I am the rather in|clined to fix upon her, as neither Mr. nor Mrs. Reeves took notice to me of it, as a thing extraordinary; which, probably, they would have done, if &s;he had exceeded her u&s;ual way. And yet, perhaps, the joy of &s;eeing her newly-arrived friends might have opened her lips. If &s;o, your pardon, &s;weet Mi&s;s Bramber!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Sally, her younger &s;i&s;ter, is very amiable and very mode&s;t; a little kept down, as it &s;eems, by the vivacity of her elder &s;i&s;ter; between who&s;e ages there are about &s;ix or &s;even years: So that Mi&s;s Bramber &s;eems to regard her &s;i&s;ter as one whom &s;he is willing to remember as the <HI>girl</HI> &s;he was two or three years ago; for Mi&s;s Sally is not above &s;eventeen.</P>
<P>What confirmed me in this, was, that the younger Lady was a good deal more free when her &s;i&s;ter was withdrawn, than when &s;he was pre&s;ent; and again pur&s;ed-up her really pretty mouth when &s;he returned: And her &s;i&s;ter addre&s;&s;ed her always by the word <HI>Child,</HI> with an air of elder&s;hip; while the other called her <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> with a look of ob&s;ervance.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Ladies.</P>
<P>The two gentlemen who came with them, were Mr. Barnet, a nephew of Lady Alle&s;tree, and Mr. Somner.</P>
<P>Mr. Somner is a young gentleman lately married; very affected, and very opinionated. I told Mrs. Reeves, after he was gone, that I believed he was a dear Lover of his per&s;on; and &s;he owned he was.
<PB N="20" REF="27">
Yet had he no great rea&s;on for it. It is far from extra|ordinary; tho' he was very gaily dre&s;&s;ed. His wife, it &s;eems, was a young widow of great fortune; and till &s;he gave him con&s;equence by falling in love with him, he was thought to be a mode&s;t good &s;ort of young man; one that had not di&s;covered any more perfec|tions in him&s;elf, than other people beheld in him; and this gave her an excu&s;e for liking him. But now he is loquacious, forward, bold; thinks meanly of the Sex; and, what is wor&s;e, not the higher of the Lady, for the preference &s;he has given him.</P>
<P>This gentleman took great notice of me; and yet in &s;uch a way, as to have me think, that the appro|bation of &s;o excellent a judge as him&s;elf, did me no &s;mall honour.</P>
<P>Mr. Barnet is a young man, that I imagine will be always young. At fir&s;t I thought him <HI>only</HI> a fop. He affected to &s;ay &s;ome things, that, tho' trite, were &s;en|tentious, and carried with them the air of ob&s;ervation. There is &s;ome degree of merit in having &s;uch a me|mory, as will help a per&s;on to repeat and apply other mens wit with &s;ome tolerable propriety. But when he attempted to walk alone, he &s;aid things that it was impo&s;&s;ible a man of common &s;en&s;e could &s;ay. I pro|nounce therefore boldly about <HI>him:</HI> Yet by his outward appearance he may pa&s;s for one of your pretty fel|lows; for he dre&s;&s;es very gaily. Indeed if he has any ta&s;te, it is in dre&s;s; and this he has found out; for he talked of little el&s;e, when he <HI>led</HI> the talk; and boa&s;ted of &s;everal parts of <HI>his.</HI> What fini&s;hed him with me, was, that as often as the conver&s;ation &s;eemed to take a &s;erious turn, he aro&s;e from his &s;eat, and hummed an Italian air; of which, however, he knew nothing: But the &s;ound of his own voice &s;eemed to plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>This fine gentleman recollected &s;ome high-flown compliments, and, applying them to me, looked as if he expected I &s;hould value my&s;elf upon them.</P>
<P>No wonder that men in general think meanly of
<PB N="21" REF="28">
us women, if they believe we have ears to hear, and folly to be plea&s;ed with, the frothy things that pa&s;s under the name of <HI>compliments</HI> from &s;uch <HI>random|&s;hooters</HI> as the&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Stevens paid us a vi&s;it this afternoon. She is daughter of Colonel Stevens, a very worthy man. She appears &s;en&s;ible and unaffected; has read, my cou&s;in &s;ays, a good deal; and yet takes no pride in &s;hewing it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Darlington came with her. They are related.</P>
<P>This young Lady has, I find, a pretty ta&s;te in poetry. Mrs. Reeves prevailed on her to &s;hew us three of her performances. And now, as it was with &s;ome re|luctance that &s;he &s;hewed them, is it fair to &s;ay any thing about them? I &s;ay it only to you, my friend.&mdash;One was, <HI>on the parting of two Lovers;</HI> very &s;en|&s;ible; and &s;o tender, that it &s;hewed the fair writer knew how to de&s;cribe the pangs that may be inno|cently allowed to ari&s;e on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.&mdash;One <HI>on the Morning-dawn,</HI> and Sun-ri&s;e; a &s;ubject that gave credit to her&s;elf; for &s;he is, it &s;eems, a very early ri&s;er. I petitioned for a copy of this, for the &s;ake of two or three of my dear cou&s;ins, as well as to confirm my own practice; but I was mode&s;tly refu&s;ed.&mdash;The third was on the death of a favourite Linnet; a little too pathetic for the occa&s;ion; &s;ince were Mi&s;s Dar|lington to have lo&s;t her be&s;t and deare&s;t friend, I ima|gine that &s;he had in this piece, which is pretty long, exhau&s;ted the &s;ubject; and mu&s;t borrow from it &s;ome of the images which &s;he introduces to heighten her di|&s;tre&s;s for the lo&s;s of the little &s;ong&s;ter. It is a very diffi|cult matter, I believe, for young per&s;ons of genius to rein-in their imaginations. A great flow of &s;pirits, and great &s;tore of images crouding in upon them, carry them too frequently above their &s;ubject; and they are apt rather to &s;ay all that <HI>may</HI> be &s;aid on their favourite topics, than what is <HI>proper</HI> to be &s;aid. But it is a pretty piece, however.</P>

<P>Lady Betty Williams &s;upped with us the &s;ame even|ing. She is an agreeable woman, the widow of a very worthy man, a near relation of Mr. Reeves. She has a great and ju&s;t regard for my cou&s;in, and con|&s;ults him in all affairs of importance. She &s;eems to be turned of Forty; has a &s;on and a daughter; but they are both abroad for education.</P>
<P>It hurt me to hear her declare, that &s;he cared not for the trouble of education; and that &s;he had this plea&s;ure, which girls brought up at home &s;eldom give their mothers; that &s;he and Mi&s;s Williams always &s;aw each other, and always parted, as Lovers.</P>
<P>Surely there mu&s;t be &s;ome fault either in the tem|per of the mother, or in the behaviour of the daughter; and if &s;o, I doubt it will not be amended by &s;eeing each other but &s;eldom. Do not Lovers thus cheat and impo&s;e upon one another?</P>
<P>The young gentleman is about Seventeen; his &s;i&s;ter about Fifteen: And, as I under&s;tand, &s;he is a very lively, and, 'tis feared, a forward girl; &s;hall we wonder, if in a few years time &s;he &s;hould make &s;uch a choice for her hu&s;band as Lady Betty would lea&s;t of all choo&s;e for a &s;on-in-law? What influence can a mother expect to have over a daughter from whom &s;he &s;o voluntarily e&s;tranges her&s;elf? and from who&s;e example the daughter can receive only hear&s;ay benefits?</P>
<P>But after all, methinks I hear my correcting uncle a&s;k, May not Lady Betty have <HI>better</HI> rea&s;ons for her conduct in this particular, than &s;he gave you?&mdash;She may, my uncle, and I hope &s;he has: But I wi&s;h &s;he had conde&s;cended to give tho&s;e better rea&s;ons, &s;ince &s;he gave any; and then you had not been troubled with the impertinent remarks of your &s;aucy kin&s;|woman.</P>
<P>Lady Betty was &s;o kind as to take great notice of me. She de&s;ired to be one in every party of plea&s;ure that I am to be engaged in. Per&s;ons who were often
<PB N="23" REF="30">
at publick places, &s;he ob&s;erved, took as much delight in accompanying &s;trangers to them, as if they were their own. The apt compari&s;ons, &s;he &s;aid; the new remarks; the pretty wonder; the agreeable pa&s;&s;ions excited in &s;uch, on the occa&s;ion, always gave her high entertainment. And &s;he was &s;ure from the ob&s;ervation of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a young Lady, civilly bowing to me, &s;he &s;hould be equally delighted and improved. I bowed in &s;ilence. I love not to make di&s;qualifying &s;peeches; by &s;uch we &s;eem to intimate, that we believe the complimenter to be in earne&s;t, or perhaps, that we think the compli|ment our due, and want to hear it either repeated or confirmed; and yet, po&s;&s;ibly, we have not that pretty confu&s;ion, and tho&s;e tran&s;ient blu&s;hes, ready, which Mr. Greville archly &s;ays are always to be at hand when we affect to di&s;claim the prai&s;es given us.</P>
<P>Lady Betty was &s;o good as to &s;top there; tho' the mu&s;cles of her agreeable face &s;hewed a polite promp|titude, had I, by di&s;claiming her compliments, pro|voked them to perform their office.</P>
<P>Am I not a &s;aucy creature?</P>
<P>I know I am. But I di&s;like not Lady Betty, for all that.</P>
<P>I am to be carried by her to a Ma&s;querade, to a Ri|dotto; when the &s;ea&s;on comes, to Ranelagh and Vaux|hall: In the mean time, to Balls, Routes, Drums, and &s;o-forth; and to qualify me for the&s;e latter, I am to be taught all the fa&s;hionable games. Did my dear grandmamma, twenty or thirty years ago, think &s;he &s;hould live to be told, That to the Dancing-ma&s;ter, the Singing or Mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, the high mode would require the Gaming-ma&s;ter to be added for the com|pleting of the female education?</P>
<P>Lady Betty will kindly take the lead in all the&s;e diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>And now, Lucy, will you not repeat your wi&s;hes, that I return to you with a &s;ound heart? And are you not afraid that I &s;hall become a modern fine Lady? As
<PB N="24" REF="31">
to the latter fear, I will tell you <HI>when</HI> you &s;hall &s;u&s;pect me&mdash;If you find that I prefer the highe&s;t of the&s;e en|tertainments, or the Opera it&s;elf, well as I love mu&s;ic, to a good Play of our favourite Shake&s;peare, then, my Lucy, let your heart ake for your Harriet: Then, be apprehen&s;ive that &s;he is laid hold on by levity; that &s;he is captivated by the Eye and the Ear; that her heart is infected by the modern ta&s;te; and that &s;he will carry down with her an appetite to pernicious gaming; and, in order to &s;upport her extravagance, will think of puni&s;hing &s;ome hone&s;t man in marriage.</P>
<P>James has &s;ignified to Sally his wi&s;hes to be allow|ed to return to Selby-hou&s;e. I have not therefore bought him the new liveries I de&s;igned for him on coming to town. I cannot bear an unchearful brow in a &s;ervant; and he owning to me, on my talking with him, his de&s;ire to return, I have promi&s;ed that he &s;hall, as &s;oon as Mr. Reeves has provided me with another &s;ervant.&mdash;Silly fellow! But I hope my aunt will not di&s;mi&s;s him upon it. The &s;ervant I may hire may not care to go into the country perhaps, or may not &s;o behave, as that I &s;hould choo&s;e to take him down with me. And James is hone&s;t, and his mother would break her heart, if he &s;hould be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed our &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Several &s;ervants have already offered them&s;elves; but, as I think people are an&s;werable for the character of &s;uch as they choo&s;e for their dome&s;tics, I find no &s;mall difficulty in fixing. I am not of the mind of that great man, who&s;e good-natur'd rea&s;on for &s;ome|times preferring men no-ways de&s;erving, was, that he loved to be a friend to tho&s;e whom no other per&s;on would befriend. This was carrying his goodne&s;s very far (if he made it not an excu&s;e for him&s;elf, for have|ing promoted a man who proved bad <HI>afterwards,</HI> rather than as &s;uppo&s;ing him to be &s;o at the <HI>time);</HI> &s;ince el&s;e, he &s;eemed not to con&s;ider, that every bad man he promoted, ran away with the reward due to a better.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="32">
Mr. and Mrs. Reeves are &s;o kind to me, and their &s;ervants are &s;o ready to oblige me, that I &s;hall not be very unea&s;y, If I cannot &s;oon get one to my mind. Only if I could fix on &s;uch a one, and if my grand|mamma's Oliver &s;hould leave her, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es he will, now he has married Ellen, as &s;oon as a good Inn offers, James may &s;upply Oliver's place, and the new &s;ervant may continue mine in&s;tead of James.</P>
<P>And now that I have gone &s;o low, don't you wi&s;h me to put an end to this Letter?&mdash;I believe you do.</P>
<P>Well then, with Duty and Love, ever remembred where &s;o ju&s;tly due, believe me to be, my dear Lucy,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>SELBY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. Jan. <HI>28.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS to what you &s;ay of Mr. Greville's concern on my ab&s;ence (and, I think, with a little too much feeling for him) and of his declaring him&s;elf unable to live without &s;eeing me; I have but one fear about it; which is, that he is forming a pretence from his <HI>Violent</HI> Love, to come up after me: And if he does, I will not &s;ee him, if I can help it.</P>
<P>And do you indeed believe him to be &s;o much in Love? By your &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s on the occa&s;ion, you &s;eem to think he is. O my Lucy! What a good heart you have! And did he not weep when he told you &s;o? Did he not turn his head away, and pull out his handkerchief?&mdash;O the&s;e di&s;&s;emblers! The hyaena, my dear, was a <HI>male</HI> devourer. The men in malice, and to extenuate their own guilt, made the creature
<PB N="26" REF="33">
a <HI>female.</HI> And yet there may be male and female of this &s;pecies of mon&s;ters. But as women have more to lo&s;e with regard to reputation than men, the male hyaena mu&s;t be infinitely the more dangerous creature of the two; &s;ince he will come to us, even into our very hou&s;es, fawning, cringing, weeping, licking our hands; while the den of the female is by the highway|&s;ide, and wretched youths mu&s;t enter into it, to put it in her power to devour them.</P>
<P>Let me tell you, my dear, that if there be an art|ful man in England, with regard to us women (artful equally in his free &s;peaking, and in his &s;ycophancies) Mr. Greville is the man. And he <HI>intends</HI> to be &s;o too, and values him&s;elf upon his art. Does he not as boldly as con&s;tantly in&s;inuate, That flattery is dearer to a woman than her food? Yet who &s;o gro&s;s a flat|terer as him&s;elf, when the humour is upon him? And yet at times he wants to build up a merit for &s;inceri|ty or plain-dealing, by &s;aying free things.</P>
<P>It is not difficult, my dear, to find out the&s;e men, were we earne&s;t to detect them. Their chief &s;trength lies in our weakne&s;s. But however weak we are, I think we &s;hould not add to the triumph of tho&s;e who make our weakne&s;s the general &s;ubject of their &s;atire. We &s;hould not prove the ju&s;tice of their ridicule by our own indi&s;cretions. But the traitor is within us. If we guard again&s;t our&s;elves, we may bid defiance to all the arts of man.</P>
<P>You know, that my great objection to Mr. Gre|ville is for his immoralities. A man of free principles, &s;hewn by practices as free, can hardly make a tender hu&s;band, were a woman able to get over con&s;idera|tions that &s;he ought <HI>not</HI> to get over. Who &s;hall tru&s;t for the performance of his <HI>&s;econd</HI> duties, the man who avowedly de&s;pi&s;es his <HI>fir&s;t?</HI> Mr. Greville had a good education: He mu&s;t have taken <HI>pains</HI> to render vain the pious precepts of his worthy father; and &s;till more, to make a je&s;t of them.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="34">
Three of his women we have heard of, be&s;ides her whom he brought with him from Wales. You know he has only affected to appear decent, &s;ince he has ca&s;t his eyes upon me. The man, my dear, mu&s;t be an abandoned man, and mu&s;t have a very hard heart, who can pa&s;s from woman to woman, without any re|mor&s;e for a former, whom, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, he has by the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows &s;educed. And who&s;e leavings is it, my dear, that a virtuous woman takes, who marries a profligate?</P>
<P>Is it not reported, that his Wel&s;hwoman, to whom, at parting, he gave not &s;ufficient for a twelvemonth's &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is now upon the town? Vile man! He thinks it to his credit, I have heard, to own it a &s;eduction, and that &s;he was not a vicious creature till he made her &s;o.</P>
<P>One only merit has Mr. Greville to plead in this black tran&s;action: It is, That he has, by his whole conduct in it, added a warning to our Sex. And &s;hall I, de&s;pi&s;ing the warning, marry a man, who, &s;pecious as he is in his temper, and lively in his conver&s;ation, has &s;hewn &s;o bad a nature?</P>
<P>His fortune, as you &s;ay, is great. The more inex|cu&s;able therefore is he for his niggardline&s;s to his Wel&s;hwoman. On his fortune he pre&s;umes: It will procure him a too ea&s;y forgivene&s;s from others of our Sex: But fortune without merit will never do with me, were the man a prince.</P>
<P>You &s;ay that if a woman re&s;olves not to marry till &s;he finds her&s;elf addre&s;&s;ed to by a man of &s;trict vir|tue, &s;he mu&s;t be for ever &s;ingle. If this be true, what wicked creatures are men! What a dreadful a|bu&s;e of pa&s;&s;ions, given them for the noble&s;t purpo&s;es, are they guilty of!</P>
<P>I have a very high notion of the marriage-&s;tate. I remember what my uncle once averred; That a woman out of wedlock is half u&s;ele&s;s to the end of her being. How indeed do the duties of a good Wife,
<PB N="28" REF="35">
of a good mother, and a worthy matron, well per|formed, dignify a woman! Let my aunt Selby's ex|ample, in her enlarged &s;phere, &s;et again&s;t that of any &s;ingle woman of like years moving in her narrow circle, te&s;tify the truth of the ob&s;ervation. My grandfather u&s;ed to &s;ay, that families are little com|munities; that there are but few &s;olid friend&s;hips out of them; and that they help to make up worthily, and to &s;ecure, the great community, of which they are &s;o many miniatures.</P>
<P>But yet it is my opinion, and I hope, that I never by my practice &s;hall di&s;credit it, that a woman who, with her eyes open, marries a profligate man, had, generally, much better remain &s;ingle all her life; &s;ince it is very likely, that by &s;uch a &s;tep &s;he defeats, as to her&s;elf, all the good ends of &s;ociety. What a dreadful, what a <HI>pre&s;umptuous</HI> ri&s;que runs &s;he, who marries a wicked man, even hoping to reclaim him, when &s;he cannot be &s;ure of keeping her own princi|ples!&mdash;<HI>Be not deceived; evil communication corrupts good manners;</HI> is a caution truly apo&s;tolical.</P>
<P>The text you mention of the <HI>unbelieving hu&s;band</HI> being converted by the <HI>believing wife,</HI> re&s;pects, as I take it, the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity; and is an in|&s;truction to the converted wife to let her unconverted hu&s;band &s;ee in her behaviour to him, <HI>while he beheld her cha&s;te conver&s;ation coupled with fear,</HI> the efficacy upon her own heart of the excellent doctrines &s;he had embraced. It could not have in view the woman who, <HI>being &s;ingle,</HI> cho&s;e a <HI>pagan hu&s;band</HI> in hopes of <HI>converting him.</HI> Nor can it give encourgement for a woman of virtue and religion to marry a profligate in hopes of <HI>reclaiming</HI> him. <HI>Who can touch pitch, and not be defiled?</HI></P>
<P>As to Mr. Fenwick, I am far from having a better opinion of him than I have of Mr. Greville. You know what is whi&s;pered of him. He has more de|cency however: He <HI>avows</HI> not free principles, as the
<PB N="29" REF="36">
other does. But you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved how much he &s;eems to enjoy the mad talk and free &s;entiments of the other: And that other always brightens up and ri&s;es in his freedoms and impiety, on Mr. Fen|wick's &s;ty applau&s;es and encouraging countenance. In a word, Mr. Fenwick, not having the &s;ame lively things to &s;ay, nor &s;o lively an air to carry them off, as Mr. Greville has, tho' he would be thought not to want &s;en&s;e, takes pains to &s;hew that he has as corrupt an heart. If I thought anger would not give him con|&s;equence, I &s;hould hardly forbear to &s;hew my&s;elf di&s;|plea&s;ed, when he points by a leering eye, and by a broad &s;mile, the free je&s;t of the other, to the per&s;on pre&s;ent whom he thinks mo&s;t apt to blu&s;h, as if for fear it &s;hould be lo&s;t; and &s;till more, when on the mantling cheek's &s;hewing the &s;en&s;ibility of the per&s;on &s;o in&s;ulted, he breaks out into a loud laugh, that &s;he may not be able to recover her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Surely the&s;e men mu&s;t think us women egregious hypocrites: They mu&s;t believe that we only affect mode&s;ty, and in our hearts approve of their freedom. For can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch as call them&s;elves gentlemen, and who have had the education and op|portunities that the&s;e two have had, would give them|&s;elves liberties of &s;peech on <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> to affront us?</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall find the London gentlemen more polite than the&s;e our neighbours of the Fox-chace. And yet hitherto I have &s;een no great cau&s;e to prefer them to the others. But about the Court, and at the fa&s;hionable public places, I expect wonders. Pray Heaven, I may not be di&s;appointed!</P>
<P>Thank Mi&s;s Orme, in my name, for the kind wi&s;hes &s;he &s;ends me. Tell her, that her doubts of my affec|tion for her are not ju&s;t; and that I do really and in|deed love her. Nor &s;hould &s;he want the mo&s;t explicit declarations of my Love, were I not more afraid of her in the character of a <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> to a truly re&s;pectable man, than doubtful of her in that of a friend to me:
<PB N="30" REF="37">
In which latter light, I even joy to con&s;ider her. But &s;he is a little naughty, tell her, becau&s;e &s;he is always leading to one &s;ubject. And yet, how can I be an|gry with her for it, if her good opinion of me in|duces her to think it in my power to make the bro|ther happy, whom &s;he &s;o dearly and de&s;ervedly loves? I cannot but e&s;teem her for the part &s;he takes.&mdash;And this it is that makes me afraid of the artle&s;ly-artful Mi&s;s Orme.</P>
<P>It would look as if I thought my Duty, and Love, and Re&s;pects, were que&s;tionable, if in every Letter I repeated them to my equally honoured and beloved benefactors, friends, and favourers. Suppo&s;e them therefore always included in my &s;ub&s;cription to you, my Lucy, when I tell you, that I am, and will be,</P>

<P>WELL! and now there wants but a London Lover or two to enter upon the &s;tage, and <HI>Vanity-Fair</HI> will be proclaimed, and directly opened. Greville every-where magnifying you, in order to ju&s;tify his flame for you: Fenwick exalting you above all women: Orme adoring you, and by his humble &s;ilence &s;aying more than any of them: Propo&s;als be&s;ides from this man: Letters from that: What &s;cenes of &s;lattery and non&s;en&s;e have I been witne&s;s to for the&s;e pa&s;t three years and half, that young Mr. Elford began the dance? Single! Well may you have remained &s;ingle till this your twentieth year, when you have &s;uch choice of admirers, that you don't know which to have. So in a Mercer's &s;hop, the trade&s;man has a fine time with you women; when variety of his rich wares di&s;tract you; and fifty to one at la&s;t, but
<PB N="31" REF="38">
as well in <HI>men</HI> as <HI>&s;ilks,</HI> you choo&s;e the wor&s;t, e&s;pecially if the be&s;t is offered at fir&s;t, and refu&s;ed: For women know better how to be &s;orry, than to amend.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is true, &s;ay you, that we young women are apt to be plea&s;ed with admiration&mdash;"</Q> O-ho! Are you &s;o? And &s;o I have gained one point with you at la&s;t; have I?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But I have always endeavoured" [And I, Harriet, wi&s;h you had &s;ucceeded in your endeavours] to keep down any fooli&s;h pride"</Q>&mdash;Then you own that pride you have?&mdash;Another point gained! Con&s;cience, hone&s;t con&s;cience, <HI>will</HI> now-and-then make you wo|men &s;peak out. But now I think of it, here is vanity in the very humility. Well &s;ay you <HI>endeavoured,</HI> when female pride, like Love, tho' hid under a barrel, will flame out at the bung.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, to your aunt Selby, to your grand|mamma, and to your cou&s;in Lucy, when we all met to &s;it in judgment upon your Letters, now I hope you'll never di&s;pute with me more on this flagrant love of admiration, which I have &s;o often ob&s;erved &s;wallows up the hearts and &s;ouls of you all; &s;ince your Harriet is not exempt from it; and &s;ince with all her &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s, with all her prudence, with all her caution, &s;he (taken with a qualm of con&s;cience) owns it.</P>
<P>But, no, truly! All is right that you <HI>&s;ay:</HI> All is right that you <HI>do</HI>&mdash;Your very confe&s;&s;ions are brought as &s;o many demon&s;trations of your diffidence, of your ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, and I cannot tell what.</P>
<P>Why, I mu&s;t own, that no father ever loved his daughter, as I love my niece: But yet, girl, your faults, your vanities, I do not love. It is my glory, that I think my&s;elf able to judge of my friends as they <HI>de&s;erve;</HI> not as being <HI>my</HI> friends. Why, the be&s;t be|loved of my heart, your aunt her&s;elf&mdash;you know, I value her now more, now le&s;s, as &s;he de&s;erves. But with all tho&s;e I have named, and with all your rela|tions
<PB N="32" REF="39">
indeed, their Harriet cannot be in fault. And why? Becau&s;e you are related to <HI>them;</HI> and becau&s;e they attribute to them&s;elves &s;ome merit from the re|lation they &s;tand in to you. <HI>Supererogatorians</HI> all of them (I <HI>will</HI> make words whenever I plea&s;e) with their <HI>attributions</HI> to you; and becau&s;e you are of their Sex, for&s;ooth; and becau&s;e I accu&s;e you in a point in which you are all concerned, and &s;o make a common cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Here one exalts you for your <HI>good &s;en&s;e;</HI> becau&s;e you have a knack, by help of an happy memory, of making every thing you read, and every thing that is told you, that you like, your own (your grand|father's precepts particularly); and becau&s;e, I think, you pa&s;s upon us, as your own, what you have borrow|ed, if not &s;tolen.</P>
<P>Another prai&s;es you for your <HI>good-nature</HI>&mdash;The duce is in it, if a girl who has crouds of admirers after her, and a new Lover where-ever &s;he &s;hews her be|witching face; who is ble&s;t with health and &s;pirits; and has every-body for her friend, let her de&s;erve it or not; can be <HI>ill</HI>-natur'd. Who can &s;uch a one have to quarrel with, trow?</P>
<P>Another extols you for your <HI>chearful wit,</HI> even when di&s;played, bold girl as you are, upon your uncle; in which indeed you are upheld by the wife of my bo&s;om, whenever I take upon me to tell you what ye all, even the be&s;t of ye, are.</P>
<P>Yet &s;ometimes they prai&s;e your <HI>mode&s;ty:</HI> And <HI>why</HI> your mode&s;ty? Becau&s;e you have a &s;kin in a manner tran&s;parent; and becau&s;e you can blu&s;h&mdash;I was going to &s;ay, whenever you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>At other times, they will find out, that you have features equally delicate and regular; when I think, and I have examined them jointly and &s;eparately, that all your <HI>takingne&s;s</HI> is owing to that open and chearful countenance, which gives them a glo&s;s (or what &s;hall I call it?) that we men are apt to be plea&s;ed with at fir&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="40">
&s;ight. A glo&s;s that takes one, as it were, by &s;urprize. But give me the beauty that grows upon us every time we &s;ee it; that leaves room for &s;omething to be found out to its advantage, as we are more and more ac|quainted with it.</P>
<P>"Your correcting uncle," you call me. And &s;o I will be. But what hope have I of your amendment, when every living &s;oul, man, woman, and child, that knows you, puffs you up? There goes Mr. Selby, I have heard &s;trangers &s;ay&mdash;And who is Mr. Selby, another &s;tranger has a&s;k'd? Why, Mr. Selby is un|cle to the celebrated Mi&s;s Byron.&mdash;Yet I, who have lived fifty years in this county, &s;hould think I might be known on my <HI>own</HI> account; and not as the <HI>uncle</HI> of a girl of twenty.</P>
<P>"Am I not a &s;aucy creature?" in another place you a&s;k. And you an&s;wer, "I know I am." I am glad you do. Now may I call you &s;o by your own authority, I hope. But with your aunt, it is only the effect of your <HI>agree-able</HI> vivacity. What abomi|nable partiality! E'en do what you will, Harriet, you'll never be in fault. I could almo&s;t wi&s;h&mdash;But I won't tell you what I wi&s;h neither. But &s;omething mu&s;t betide you, that you little think of; depend upon that. All your days cannot be halcyon ones. I would give a thou&s;and pounds with all my &s;oul, to &s;ee you heartily in love: Ay, up to the very ears, and unable to help your&s;elf! You are not <HI>thirty</HI> yet, child. And, indeed, you &s;eem to <HI>think</HI> the time of danger is <HI>not over.</HI> I am glad of your <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> my dear. Shall I tell Greville of your doubts, and of your difficulties, Harriet? As to the ten <HI>coming</HI> years, I mean? And &s;hall I tell him of your prayer to pa&s;s them &s;afely?&mdash;But is not this wi&s;h of yours, that ten years of bloom were over-pa&s;t, and that you were ar|rived at the thirtieth year of your age, a very &s;ingular one?&mdash;A flight! A mere flight! A&s;k ninety-nine of your Sex out of an hundred, if they would adopt it.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="41">
In another Letter you a&s;k Lucy, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If Mr. Greville has not &s;aid, that flattery is dearer to a woman than her food."</Q> Well, niece, and what would you be at? Is it not &s;o?&mdash;I do averr, that Mr. Greville is a &s;en&s;ible man; and makes good ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mens chief &s;trength, you &s;ay, lies in the weak|ne&s;s of women."</Q> Why &s;o it does. Where el&s;e &s;hould it lie? And this from their immea&s;urable love of admiration and flattery, as here you &s;eem to ac|knowlege of your own accord, tho' it has been &s;o often perver&s;ly di&s;puted with me. Give you women but rope enough, you'll do your own bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>However, in many places you have plea&s;ed me. But no-where more than when you recollect my <HI>averr|ment</HI> (without contradicting it; which is a rarity!) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that a woman out of wedlock is half u&s;ele&s;s to the end of her being."</Q> Good girl! That was an a&s;&s;er|tion of mine, and I will abide by it. Lucy &s;imper'd when we came to this place, and look'd at me. She expected, I &s;aw, my notice upon it; &s;o did your aunt: But the confe&s;&s;ion was &s;o frank, that I was generous, and only &s;aid, True as the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I have written a long Letter: Yet have not &s;aid one quarter of what I intended to &s;ay when I began. You will allow that you have given your <HI>correcting</HI> Uncle, ample &s;ubject. But you fare &s;omething the better for &s;aying, "you unbe&s;peak not your monitor."</P>
<P>You <HI>own,</HI> that you have &s;ome vanity. Be more free in your acknowlegements of this nature (you <HI>may;</HI> for are you not a woman?) and you'll fare &s;ome|thing the better for your ingenuouine&s;s; and the ra|ther, as your acknowlegements will help me up with your aunt and Lucy, and your grandmamma, in an argument I will not give up.</P>
<P>I have had fre&s;h applications made to me&mdash;But I will not &s;ay from whom: Since we have agreed long ago, not to pre&s;cribe to &s;o di&s;creet a girl, as, in the main, we all think you, in the articles of Love and Marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="42">
With all your faults I mu&s;t love you. I am half a&s;hamed to &s;ay how much I mi&s;s you already. We are all naturally chearful folks: Yet, I don't know how it is; your ab&s;ence has made a &s;trange cha&s;m at our table. Let us hear from you every po&s;t: That will be &s;omething. Your doting aunt tells the hours on the day &s;he expects a Letter. Your grandmother is at pre&s;ent with us, and in heart I am &s;ure regrets your ab&s;ence: But as your tenderne&s;s to her has kept you from going to London for &s;o many years, &s;he thinks &s;he ought to be ea&s;y.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day, Jan. <HI>31.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM already, my dear Lucy, quite contrary to my own expectation, enabled to obey the third general injunction laid upon me, at parting, by you, and all my dear friends; &s;ince a gentleman, not incon&s;idera|ble in his family or fortune, has already beheld your Harriet with partiality.</P>
<P>Not to heighten your impatience by unnece&s;&s;ary parade, his name is <HI>Fowler.</HI> He is a young gentle|man of an hand&s;ome independent fortune, and &s;till larger expectations from a Wel&s;h uncle now in town, Sir Rowland Meredith, knighted in his Sheriffalty, on occa&s;ion of an addre&s;s which he brought up to the King from his County.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland, it &s;eems, requires from his Nephew, on pain of forfeiting his favour for ever, that he mar|ries not without his approbation: Which, he declares, he never will give, except the woman be of a good fa|mily; has a gentlewoman's fortune; has had the benefit
<PB N="36" REF="43">
of a religious education; which he con&s;iders as the be&s;t &s;ecurity that can be given for her good behaviour as a wife, and as a <HI>mother;</HI> &s;o forward does the good knight look! Her character un&s;ullied: Acquainted with the theory of the dome&s;tic duties, and not a&s;ha|med, occa&s;ionally, to enter into the direction of the practic. Her fortune, however, as his nephew will have a good one, he declares to be the lea&s;t thing he &s;tands upon; only that he would have her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of from &s;ix to ten thou&s;and pounds, that it may not ap|pear to be a match of mere Love, and as if his ne|phew were <HI>taken in,</HI> as he calls it, rather by the eyes, than by the under&s;tanding. Where a woman can have &s;uch a fortune given her by her family, tho' no greater, it will be an earne&s;t, he &s;ays, that the family &s;he is of, have <HI>worth,</HI> as he calls it, and want not to owe obligations to that of the man &s;he marries.</P>
<P>Something particular, &s;omething that has the look of foreca&s;t and prudence, you'll &s;ay, in the old knight.</P>
<P>O but I had like to have forgot; his future niece mu&s;t al&s;o be hand&s;ome. He values him&s;elf, it &s;eems, upon the breed of his hor&s;es and dogs; and makes polite compari&s;ons between the <HI>more</HI> noble, and the <HI>le&s;s</HI> noble animals.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland him&s;elf, as you will gue&s;s by his par|ticularity, is an old bachelor, and one who wants to have a woman made on purpo&s;e for his nephew; and who po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ts upon qualities, before he knows her, not one of which, perhaps, his future niece will have.</P>
<P>Don't you remember Mr. Tol&s;on of Derby&s;hire? He was determined never to marry a widow. If he did, it &s;hould be one, who had a va&s;t fortune, and who never had a child. And he had &s;till a more par|ticular exception; and that was to a woman who had red hair. He held the&s;e exceptions till he was forty; and then being looked upon as a <HI>determin'd</HI> bachelor, no family thought it worth their while to make pro|po&s;als
<PB N="37" REF="44">
to him: No woman to throw out a net for him (to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the &s;tile of the gay Mr. Greville); and he at la&s;t fell in with, and married, the laughing Mrs. Turner: A widow, who had little or no fortune, had one child, a daughter, living, and that child an ab&s;olute idiot; and, to complete the perver&s;ene&s;s of his fate, her hair not only red, but the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable of reds. The hone&s;t man was grown &s;plenetic: di&s;regarded by every|body, he was become di&s;regardful of him&s;elf: He hoped for a cure of his gloomine&s;s, from her chearful vein; and &s;eemed to think him&s;elf under obligation to one who had taken notice of him, when nobody el&s;e would. Bachelors wives! Maids children! The&s;e old &s;aws always mean &s;omething.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler &s;aw me at my cou&s;in Reeves's the fir&s;t time. I cannot &s;ay he is di&s;agreeable in his <HI>per&s;on:</HI> But he &s;eems to want the <HI>mind</HI> I would have a man ble&s;s'd with, to whom I am to vow love and honour. I purpo&s;e, whenever I marry, to make a very good and even a dutiful wife [Mu&s;t I not vow obedience? And &s;hall I break my marriage-vow?]: I would not, therefore, on any con&s;ideration, marry a man, who&s;e want of knowlege might make me &s;tagger in the per|formance of my duty to him; and who would per|haps command, from caprice or want of under&s;tanding, what I &s;hould think unrea&s;onable to be complied with. There is a plea&s;ure and a credit in yielding up even one's judgment in things indifferent, to a man who is older and wi&s;er than one's &s;elf. But we are apt to doubt in one of a contrary character, what in the other we &s;hould have no doubt about: And doubt, you know, of a per&s;on's merit, is the fir&s;t &s;tep to di&s;re|&s;pect: And what, but di&s;obedience, which lets in every evil, is the next?</P>
<P>I &s;aw in&s;tantly that Mr. Fowler beheld me with a di&s;tingui&s;hed regard. We women, you know [Let me for once be aforehand with my uncle] are very quick in making di&s;coveries of this nature. But every|body
<PB N="38" REF="45">
at table &s;aw it. He came again next day, and be&s;ought Mr. Reeves to give him his intere&s;t with me, without a&s;king any que&s;tions about my fortune; tho' he was even generou&s;ly particular as to his own. He might, &s;ince he has an unexceptionable one. Who is it in the&s;e ca&s;es that forgets to &s;et foremo&s;t the advan|tages by which he is di&s;tingui&s;hed? While fortune is the la&s;t thing talk'd of by him who has little or none: And then <HI>Love, Love, Love,</HI> is all his cry.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves, who has a good opinion of Mr. Fow|ler, in an&s;wer to his enquiries, told him, that he be|lieved I was di&s;engaged in my affections: Mr. Fow|ler rejoiced at that. That I had no que&s;tions to a&s;k; but tho&s;e of duty; which indeed, he &s;aid, was a &s;tronger tie with me than intere&s;t. He prai&s;ed my temper, and my frankne&s;s of heart; the latter at the expence of my Sex; for which I lea&s;t thank'd him, when he told me what he had &s;aid. In &s;hort, he acquainted him with every-thing that was nece&s;&s;ary, and more than was nece&s;&s;ary, for him to know, of the favour of my family, and of my good Mr. Deane, in referring all propo&s;als of this kind to my&s;elf; min|gling the detail with commendations, which only could be excu&s;ed by the goodne&s;s of his own heart, and accounted for by his partiality to his cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler expre&s;&s;ed great apprehen&s;ions on my cou&s;in's talking of the&s;e references of my grand|mother, aunt, and Mr. Deane, to my&s;elf, on occa|&s;ions of this nature; which, he &s;aid, he pre&s;umed had been too frequent for his hopes.</P>
<P>If you have any hope, Mr. Fowler, &s;aid Mr. Reeves, it mu&s;t be in your good character; and that much preferably to your clear e&s;tate and great expec|tations. Altho' &s;he takes no pride in the number of her admirers, yet is it natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that it has made her more difficult; and her difficulties are en|hanced, in proportion to the generous confidence which all her friends have in her di&s;cretion. And
<PB N="39" REF="46">
when I told him, proceeded Mr. Reeves, that your fortune exceeded greatly what Sir Rowland required in a wife for him; and that you had, as well from inclination, as education, a &s;erious turn; Too much, too much, in one per&s;on, cried he out. As to fortune, he wi&s;h'd you had not a &s;hilling; and if he could ob|tain your favour, he &s;hould be the happie&s;t man in the world.</P>
<P>O my good Mr. Reeves, &s;aid I, how have you over-rated my merits! Surely, you have not given Mr. Fowler your intere&s;t? If you <HI>have,</HI> &s;hould you not, for <HI>his</HI> &s;ake, have known &s;omething of my mind before you had &s;et me out thus, had I even de&s;erved your high opinion? or Mr. Fowler might have rea|&s;on to repent the double well-meant kindne&s;s of his friend, if men in the&s;e days were u&s;ed to break their hearts for Love.</P>
<P>It is the language I do and mu&s;t talk of you in, to every-body, return'd Mr. Reeves: Is it not the lan|guage that tho&s;e mo&s;t talk who know you be&s;t?</P>
<P>Where the world is inclined to favour, replied I, it is apt to <HI>over</HI>-rate, as much as it will <HI>under</HI>-rate where it disfavours. In this ca&s;e, you &s;hould not have proceeded &s;o far as to engage a gentleman's hopes. What may be the end of all this, but to make a compa&s;&s;ionate nature, as mine has been thought to be, if Mr. Fowler &s;hould be greatly in earne&s;t, unea&s;y to it&s;elf, in being obliged to &s;hew Pity, where &s;he cannot return Love?</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid, I have &s;aid, replied Mr. Reeves. Pity is but one remove from Love. Mrs. Reeves (There &s;he &s;its) was fir&s;t brought to pity me; for ne|ver was man more madly in love than I; and then I thought my&s;elf &s;ure of her. And &s;o it proved. I can tell you I am no enemy to Mr. Fowler.</P>
<P>And &s;o, my dear, Mr. Fowler &s;eems to think he has met with a woman who would make a fit wife for him: But your Harriet, I doubt, has not in Mr.
<PB N="40" REF="47">
Fowler met with a man whom &s;he can think a fit Hu&s;band for her.</P>
<P>The very next morning, Sir Rowland him&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>But now, my Lucy, if I proceed to tell you all the fine things that are &s;aid <HI>of</HI> me and <HI>to</HI> me, what will my uncle Selhy &s;ay? Will he not attribute all I &s;hall repeat of this &s;ort, to that pride, to that vanity, to that &s;ond|ne&s;s of admiration, which he, as well as Mr. Greville, is continually charging upon all our Sex?</P>
<P>Yet he expects that I &s;hall give a minute account of every thing that pa&s;&s;es, and of every conver&s;ation in which I have any part. How &s;hall I do to plea&s;e him? And yet I know I &s;hall <HI>be&s;t</HI> plea&s;e him, if I give him room to find fault with me. But then &s;hould he for my faults blame the whole Sex? Is that ju&s;t?</P>
<P>You will tell me, I know, that if I give &s;peeches and conver&s;ations, I ought to give them ju&s;tly: That the humours and characters of per&s;ons cannot be known unle&s;s I repeat <HI>what</HI> they &s;ay, and their <HI>manner</HI> of &s;ay|ing: That I mu&s;t leave it to the &s;peakers and com|plimenters to an&s;wer for the likene&s;s of the pictures they draw: That I know be&s;t my own heart, and whether I am puffed up by the prai&s;es given me: That if I <HI>am,</HI> I &s;hall di&s;cover it by my &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s, and be enough puni&s;hed on the di&s;covery, by incurring, from tho&s;e I love, de&s;erved blame, if not contempt, in&s;tead of pre&s;erving their wi&s;hed-for e&s;teem.&mdash;Let me add to all this, that there is an author (I forget who) who &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is lawful to repeat tho&s;e things, tho' &s;poken in our prai&s;e, that are nece&s;&s;ary to be known, and cannot otherwi&s;e be come at."</Q></P>
<P>And now let me a&s;k, Will this preamble do, once for all?</P>
<P>It will. And &s;o &s;ays my aunt Selby. And &s;o &s;ays every one but my uncle. Well then, I will proceed, and repeat all that &s;hall be &s;aid, and that as well to my di&s;advantage as advantage; only re&s;olving not to be exalted with the one, and to do my endeavour to
<PB N="41" REF="48">
amend by the other. And here, pray tell my uncle, that I do not de&s;ire he will &s;pare me; &s;ince the faults he &s;hall find in his Harriet &s;hall always put her upon her guard&mdash;Not, however, to conceal them from his di&s;cerning eye; but to amend them.</P>
<P>And now, having, as I &s;aid, once for all, prepared you to guard again&s;t a &s;urfeit of &s;elf-prai&s;e, tho' de|livered at &s;econd or third hand, I will go on with my narrative&mdash;But hold&mdash;my paper reminds me, that I have written a mon&s;trous letter&mdash;I will therefore, with a new &s;heet, begin a new one. Only adding to this, that I am, and ever will be,</P>

<P>THE very next morning Sir Rowland him&s;elf paid his re&s;pects to Mr. Reeves.</P>
<P>The knight, before he would open him&s;elf very freely as to the bu&s;ine&s;s he came upon, de&s;ired that he might have an opportunity to &s;ee me. I knew no|thing of him, nor of his bu&s;ine&s;s. We were ju&s;t going to breakfa&s;t. Mi&s;s Alle&s;tree, Mi&s;s Bramber, and Mi&s;s Dolyns, a young Lady of merit, were with us.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="49">
Ju&s;t as we had taken our &s;eats, Mr. Reeves intro|duced Sir Rowland, but let him not know which was Mi&s;s Byron. He did nothing at fir&s;t &s;itting down, but peer in our faces by turns; and fixing his eye upon Mi&s;s Alle&s;tree, he jogged Mr. Reeves with his elbow&mdash;Hay, Sir?&mdash;audibly whi&s;pered he.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves was &s;ilent. Sir Rowland, who is &s;hort|&s;ighted, then look'd under his bent brows, at Mi&s;s Bramber; then at Mi&s;s Dolyns; and then at me&mdash;Fay, Sir? whi&s;pered he again.</P>
<P>He &s;at out the fir&s;t di&s;h of tea with an impatience equal, as it &s;eemed, to his uncertainty. And at la&s;t taking Mr. Reeves by one of his buttons, de&s;ired a word with him. They withdrew together; and the knight, not quitting hold of Mr. Reeves's button, Ads-my-life, Sir, &s;aid he, I hope I am right. I love my Nephew as I love my&s;elf. I live but for him. He ever was dutiful to me his uncle. If that be Mi&s;s Byron who &s;its on the right-hand of your Lady, with the coun|tenance of an angel, her eyes &s;parkling with good humour, and blooming as a May-morning, the bu&s;i|ne&s;s is <HI>done.</HI> I give my con&s;ent. Altho' I heard not a word pa&s;s from her lips, I am &s;ure &s;he is all in|telligence. My boy <HI>&s;hall</HI> have her. The other young Ladies are agreeable: But if this be the Lady my kin&s;man is in Love with, he <HI>&s;hall</HI> have her. How will &s;he out&s;hine all our Caermarthen Ladies; and yet we have charming girls in Caermarthen!&mdash;Am I, or am I not right, Mr. Reeves, as to my nephew's <HI>flame,</HI> as they call it?</P>
<P>The Lady you de&s;cribe, Sir Rowland, is Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>And then Mr. Reeves, in his u&s;ual partial manner, let his heart overflow at his lips in my favour.</P>
<P>Thank God, thank God! &s;aid the knight. Let us return. Let us go in again. I will &s;ay &s;omething to her to make her &s;peak. But not a word to da&s;h her. I expect her voice to be mu&s;ic, if it be as har|monious
<PB N="43" REF="50">
as the re&s;t of her. By the &s;oftne&s;s or har&s;h|ne&s;s of the voice, let me tell you, Mr. Reeves, I form a judgment of the heart, and &s;oul, and manners of a Lady. 'Tis a <HI>criterion,</HI> as they call it, of my own; and I am hardly ever mi&s;taken. Let us go in again, I pray ye.</P>
<P>They returned, and took their &s;eats; the knight making an aukward apology for taking my cou&s;in out.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland, his forehead &s;moothed, and his face &s;hining, &s;at &s;welling, as big with meaning, yet not knowing how to begin. Mrs. Reeves and Mi&s;s Alle|&s;tree were talking at the re-entrance of the gentle|men. Sir Rowland thought he mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething, however di&s;tant from his main purpo&s;e. Breaking &s;ilence therefore; You, Ladies, &s;eemed to be deep in di&s;cour&s;e when we came in. Whatever were your &s;ubject, I beg you will re&s;ume it.</P>
<P>They had fini&s;hed, they a&s;&s;ured him, what they had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland &s;eemed &s;till at a lo&s;s. He hemm'd three times; and look'd at me with particular kind|ne&s;s. Mr. Reeves then, in pity to his fulne&s;s, a&s;ked him how long he propo&s;ed to &s;tay in town?</P>
<P>He had thought, he &s;aid, to have &s;et out in a week; but &s;omething had happened, which he believed could not be completed under a <HI>fortnight.</HI> Yet I want to be down, &s;aid he; for I had ju&s;t fini&s;hed, as I came up, the new-built hou&s;e I de&s;ign to pre&s;ent to my nephew when he marries. I pretend, plain man as I am, to be a judge, both of ta&s;te and elegance. Sir Rowland was now &s;et a going. All I wi&s;h for is to &s;ee him happily &s;ettled. Ah, Ladies! that I need not go further than this table for a wife for my boy?</P>
<P>We all &s;miled, and look'd upon each other.</P>
<P>You young Ladies, proceeded he, have great ad|vantages in certain ca&s;es over us men; and this (which I little thought of till it came to be my own ca&s;e)
<PB N="44" REF="51">
whether we &s;peak for our kindred or for our&s;elves. But will you, madam, to Mrs. Reeves, will you, Sir, to Mr. Reeves, an&s;wer my que&s;tions&mdash;as to the&s;e Ladies?&mdash;I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have a niece among them. My ne|phew, tho' I &s;ay it, is one whom any Lady may love. And as for fortune, let me alone to make him, in <HI>addition</HI> to his own, all clear as the &s;un, worthy of any woman's acceptance, tho' &s;he were a Duche&s;s.</P>
<P>We were all &s;ilent, and &s;miled upon one another.</P>
<P>What I would a&s;k then, is, Which of the Ladies before me&mdash;Mercy! I believe by their &s;miling, and by their pretty looks, they are none of them engag|ed. I will begin with the young lady on your right|hand. She looks <HI>&s;o</HI> lovely, <HI>&s;o</HI> good-natur'd, and <HI>&s;o</HI> conde&s;cending!&mdash;Mercy! what an open forehead!&mdash;Hem!&mdash;Forgive me, madam; but I believe you would not di&s;dain to an&s;wer my que&s;tion your&s;elf.&mdash;Are you, madam, are you ab&s;olutely and <HI>bona fide,</HI> di&s;engaged? or are you not?</P>
<P>As this, Sir Rowland, an&s;wer'd I, is a que&s;tion I can be&s;t re&s;olve, I frankly own, that I am di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>Charming! charming!&mdash;Mercy! Why now what a noble frankne&s;s in that an&s;wer!&mdash;No je&s;ting mat|ter! You may &s;mile, Ladies.&mdash;I hope, madam, you &s;ay true. I hope I may rely upon it, that your affec|tions are not engaged.</P>
<P>You may, Sir Rowland. I do not love, even in je&s;t, to be guilty of an untruth.</P>
<P>Admirable!&mdash;But let me tell you, madam, that I hope you will not many days have this to &s;ay. Ad's-my-life! &s;weet &s;oul! how I rejoice to &s;ee that charm|ing flu&s;h in the fine&s;t cheek in the world! But heaven forbid that I &s;hould da&s;h &s;o &s;weet a creature!&mdash;Well, but now there is no going further. Excu&s;e me, Ladies; I mean not a &s;light to any of you: But now, you know, there is no going further:&mdash;And will you, madam, permit me to introduce to you, as a Lover, as an humble Servant, a very proper and
<PB N="45" REF="52">
agreeable young man? <HI>Let</HI> me introduce him: He is <HI>my</HI> nephew. Your looks are all graciou&s;ne&s;s. Per|haps you have &s;een him: And if you are really di&s;en|gaged, you can have no objection to him; of that I am confident. And I am told, that you have nobody that either <HI>can</HI> or <HI>will</HI> controul you.</P>
<P>The more controulable for that very rea&s;on, Sir Rowland.</P>
<P>Ad's-my-life, I like your an&s;wer. Why, madam, you mu&s;t be full as good as you look to be. I wi&s;h I were a young man my&s;elf for <HI>your &s;ake!</HI> But tell me, madam, will you permit a vi&s;it from my nephew this afternoon?&mdash;Come, come, dear young lady, be as gracious as you look to be. Fortune mu&s;t do. Had you not a &s;hilling, I &s;hould rejoice in &s;uch a niece: And that is more than I ever &s;aid in my life before. My nephew is a &s;ober man, a mode&s;t man. He has a good e&s;tate of his own: A clear 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a year. I will add to it in my life-time as much more. Be all this good company witne&s;&s;es for me. I am no flincher. It is well known that the word of Sir Rowland Mere|dith is as good as his bond at all times. I love the&s;e open doings. I love to be above-board. What &s;ig|nifies &s;hilly-&s;hally? What &s;ays the old proverb?</P>
<Q><L>Happy's the wooing</L>
<L>That is not long a doing.</L></Q>
<P>But, Sir Rowland, &s;aid I, there are proverbs that may be &s;et again&s;t your proverb. You hint that I have &s;een the gentleman: Now I have never yet &s;een the man who&s;e addre&s;&s;es I could encourage.</P>
<P>O, I like you the better for that. None but the <HI>giddy</HI> love at fir&s;t &s;ight. Ad's-my-life, you would have been &s;napt up before now, young as you are, could you ea&s;ily have returned love for love. Why, madam, you cannot be above &s;ixteen?</P>
<P>O, Sir Rowland, you are mi&s;taken. Chearfulne&s;s, and a contented mind, make a difference to advan|tage
<PB N="46" REF="53">
of half a dozen years at any time. I am much nearer twenty-one than <HI>nineteen,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Nearer to twenty-one than <HI>nineteen,</HI> and yet &s;o free|ly tell your age without a&s;king!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron, Sir Rowland, &s;aid Mrs. Reeves, is young enough at twenty, &s;urely, to own her age.</P>
<P>True, madam; but at twenty, if not before, time always &s;tands &s;till with women. A Lady's age once known, will be always remembred; and that more for Spite than Love. At twenty-eight or thirty, I be|lieve mo&s;t Ladies are willing to &s;trike off half a dozen years at lea&s;t&mdash;And yet, and yet (&s;miling, and looking arch) I have always &s;aid (pardon me, Ladies) that it is a &s;ign, when women are &s;o de&s;irous to conceal their age, that they think they &s;hall be good for-nothing when in years. Ah, Ladies! &s;haking his head, and laughing, women don't think of that. But how I admire you, madam, for your frankne&s;s! Would to the Lord you were twenty-four!&mdash;I would have no woman marry under twenty-four: And that, let me tell you, Ladies, for the following rea&s;ons&mdash;&s;tand|ing up, and putting the fore-finger of his right-hand, extended with a flouri&s;h, upon the thumb of his left.</P>
<P>O, Sir Rowland! I doubt not but you can give very good rea&s;ons. And I a&s;&s;ure you, I intend not to marry on the wrong &s;ide, as I call it, of twenty-four.</P>
<P>Admirable, by Mercy! but that won't do neither. The man lives not, young Lady, who will &s;tay your time, if he can have you at his. I love your noble frankne&s;s. Then &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s of countenance (&s;itting down, and audibly whi&s;pering, and jogging my cou&s;in with his elbow) &s;uch dove-like eyes, daring to tell all that is in the hone&s;t heart!&mdash;I am a phy&s;iognomi&s;t, madam (rai&s;ing his voice to me). Ad's-my-life, you are a perfect paragon! Say you will encourage my boy, or you'll be wor&s;e off; for (&s;tanding up again) I will come and court you my&s;elf. A good e&s;tate gives

a man confidence; and, when I &s;et about it&mdash;Hum!&mdash;(one hand &s;tuck in his &s;ide; flouri&s;hing with the other) no woman yet, I do a&s;&s;ure you,&mdash;ever won my heart as you have done.</P>
<P>O, Sir Rowland, I thought you were too wi&s;e to be &s;wayed by fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions: None but the <HI>giddy,</HI> you know, love at fir&s;t &s;ight.</P>
<P>Admirable! admirable indeed! I knew you had wit at will; and I am &s;ure you have wi&s;dom. Know you, Ladies, that <HI>wit</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> are two different things, and are very rarely &s;een together? Plain man, as I appear to be (looking on him&s;elf fir&s;t on one &s;ide, then on the other, and unbuttoning his coat two but|tons to let a gold braid appear upon his wai&s;tcoat) I can tell ye, I have not lived all this time for nothing. I am con&s;idered in Wales&mdash;Hem!&mdash;But I will not prai&s;e my&s;elf.&mdash;Ad's-my-life! how do this young Lady's perfections run me all into tongue!&mdash;But I &s;ee you all re&s;pect her as well as I; &s;o I need not make apology to the re&s;t of you young Ladies, for the di&s;tin|ction paid to her. I wi&s;h I had as many nephews as there are Ladies of ye di&s;engaged: By Mercy, we would be all of kin.</P>
<P>Thank you, Sir Rowland, &s;aid each of the young Ladies, &s;miling, and diverted at his oddity.</P>
<P>But as to my ob&s;ervation, continued the knight, that none but the <HI>giddy</HI> love at fir&s;t &s;ight: There is no general rule, without exception, you know: Every man <HI>mu&s;t</HI> love <HI>you</HI> at fir&s;t &s;ight. Do I not love you my&s;elf? and yet never did I &s;ee you before, nor any body like you.</P>
<P>You know not what you do, Sir Rowland, to rai&s;e thus the vanity of a poor girl. How may you make conceit and pride run away with her, till &s;he become contemptible for both in the eye of every per&s;on who&s;e good opinion is worth cultivating?</P>
<P>Ad's-my-life, that's prettily &s;aid! But let me tell you, that the <HI>&s;he</HI> who can give this caution in the
<PB N="48" REF="55">
mid&s;t of her prai&s;ings, can be in no danger of being run away with by her vanity. Why, madam! you <HI>extort</HI> prai&s;es from me! I never ran on &s;o glibly in prai&s;e of mortal woman before. You mu&s;t cea&s;e to look, to &s;mile, to &s;peak, I can toll you, if you would have me cea&s;e to prai&s;e you.</P>
<P>'Tis well you are not a young man, Sir Rowland, &s;aid Mi&s;s Alle&s;tree. You &s;eem to have the art of en|gaging a woman's attention. You &s;eem to know how to turn her own artillery again&s;t her; and as your &s;ex generally do, exalt her in court&s;hip, that you may have it in your power to aba&s;e her afterwards.</P>
<P>Why, madam, I mu&s;t own, that we men live to &s;ixty, before we know how to deal with you Ladies, or with the world either; and then we are not fit to engage with the one, and are ready to quit the other. An old head upon a young pair of &s;houlders would make rare work among ye. But to the main point (looking very kindly on me) I a&s;k no que&s;tions about you, madam. Fortune is not to be mentioned. I want you not to have any. Not that the Lady is the wor&s;e for having a fortune: And a man may &s;tand a chance for as good a wife among tho&s;e who have fortunes, as among tho&s;e who have none. I adore you for your frankne&s;s of heart. Be all of a piece now, I be&s;eech you. You are di&s;engaged, you &s;ay: Will you admit of a vi&s;it from my nephew? My boy may be ba&s;hful. True Love is always mode&s;t and diffident. You don't look as if you would di&s;like a man for being mode&s;t. And I will come along with him <HI>my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>And then the old knight look'd important, as one who, if he lent his head to his nephew's &s;houlders, had no doubt of &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P>What, Sir Rowland! admit of a vi&s;it from your nephew, in order to engage him in a three years court&s;hip? I have told you that I intend not to mar|ry till I am twenty-four.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="56">
Twenty-four, I mu&s;t own, is the age of marriage I &s;hould choo&s;e for a Lady; and for the rea&s;ons afore|&s;aid.&mdash;But, now I think of it, I did not tell you my rea&s;ons&mdash;The&s;e be they&mdash;Down went his cup and &s;awcer; up went his left-hand ready &s;pread, and his crooked finger of his right-hand, as ready to enume|rate.</P>
<P>No doubt, Sir Rowland, you have very good rea|&s;ons.</P>
<P>But, madam, you mu&s;t <HI>hear</HI> them&mdash;And I &s;hall prove&mdash;</P>
<P>I am convinced, Sir Rowland, that twenty-four is an age early enough.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall prove, madam, that you at twenty, or at twenty-one&mdash;</P>
<P>Enough! enough! Sir Rowland: What need of proof when one is convinc'd?</P>
<P>But you know not, madam, what I was driving at&mdash;</P>
<P>Well but, Sir Rowland, &s;aid Mi&s;s Bramber, will not the rea&s;ons you could give for the proper age at twenty-four, make again&s;t your wi&s;hes in this ca&s;e?</P>
<P>They will make again&s;t them, madam, in general ca&s;es. But in this particular ca&s;e they will make for me. For the Lady before me is&mdash;</P>
<P>Not in my opinion, perhaps, Sir Rowland, will your rea&s;ons make for you: And then your exception in my favour will &s;ignify nothing. And be&s;ides, you mu&s;t know, that I never can accept of any compli|ment that is made me at the expence of my Sex.</P>
<P>Well then, madam, I hope you forbid me in fa|vour to my plea. You are loth to hear any thing for twenty-four again&s;t twenty-one, I hope?</P>
<P>That is another point, Sir Rowland.</P>
<P>Why, madam, you &s;eem to be afraid of hearing my rea&s;ons. No man living knows better than I, how to behave in Ladies company. I believe I &s;hould not be &s;o little of a gentleman, as to offend the nice&s;t
<PB N="50" REF="57">
ear. No need indeed! no need indeed! looking archly; Ladies on certain &s;ubjects are very quick.</P>
<P>That is to &s;ay, Sir Rowland, interrupted Mrs. Reeves, that mode&s;ty is ea&s;ily alarmed.</P>
<P>If any thing is &s;aid, or implied, upon certain &s;ubjects that you would not be thought to under&s;tand, Ladies know how to be ignorant. And then he laughed.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, Sir Rowland, &s;aid I, &s;uch company as this, need not be apprehen&s;ive, that a gentleman, like you, &s;hould &s;ay any thing un&s;uitable to it. But do you really think affected ignorance can be ever graceful, or a proof of true delicacy? Let me rather &s;ay, That a woman of virtue would be wanting to her character, if &s;he had not courage enough to ex|pre&s;s her re&s;entment of any di&s;cour&s;e, that is meant as an in&s;ult upon mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Admirably &s;aid again! But men will &s;ometimes forget, that there are Ladies in company.</P>
<P>Very favourably put for the men, Sir Rowland. But pardon me, if I own, that I &s;hould have a mean opinion of a man, who allowed him&s;elf to talk even to <HI>men</HI> what a woman might not hear. A pure heart, whether in man or woman, will be always, in every company, on every occa&s;ion, pure.</P>
<P>Ad's-my-life, you have excellent notions, madam! I wanted to hear you &s;peak ju&s;t now: And now you make me, and every one el&s;e, &s;ilent&mdash;Twenty-one! why what you &s;ay would &s;hame <HI>Sixty-one.</HI> You mu&s;t have kept excellent company all your life!&mdash;Mercy! if ever I heard the like from a Lady &s;o young!&mdash;What a glory do you reflect back upon all who had any hand in your education! Why was I not born within the pa&s;t thirty years? I might then have had &s;ome hopes of you my&s;elf.&mdash;And this brings me to my for|mer &s;ubject, of my nephew&mdash;But, Mr. Reeves, one word with you, Mr. Reeves. I beg your pardon, Ladies. But the importance of the matter will excu&s;e

me: And I mu&s;t get out of town as &s;oon as I can.&mdash;One word with you, Mr. Reeves.</P>
<P>The gentlemen withdrew together: For breakfa&s;t by this time was over. And then the knight open'd all his heart to Mr. Reeves, and be&s;ought his intere&s;t. He would afterwards have obtained an audience, as he called it, of me: But the three young Ladies have|ing taken leave of us, and Mrs. Reeves and I being retired to dre&s;s, I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>He then reque&s;ted leave to attend me to-morrow evening: But Mr. Reeves pleading engagements till Monday evening, he be&s;ought him to indulge him with his intere&s;t in that long <HI>gap of time,</HI> as he called it, and for my being then in the way.</P>
<P>And thus, Lucy, have I given you an ample ac|count of what has pa&s;&s;ed with regard to this new &s;ervant, as gentlemen call them&s;elves, in order to become our ma&s;ters.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday Night.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SOME amu&s;ement, my Lucy, the day has afford|ed: Indeed more than I could have wi&s;hed. A large pacquet, however, for Selby-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Lady Betty received us mo&s;t politely. She had company with her, to whom &s;he introduced us, and pre&s;ented me in a very advantageous character.</P>
<P>Shall I tell you how their fir&s;t appearance &s;truck me, and what I have &s;ince heard and ob&s;erved of them?</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="59">
The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention was Mi&s;s Cantillon; very pretty; but vi&s;ibly proud, affected, and conceited.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Mi&s;s Clements; plain; but of a fine under&s;tanding, improved by reading; and who have|ing no per&s;onal advantages to be vain of, has, by the cultivation of her mind, obtained a preference in e|very one's opinion over the fair Cantillon.</P>
<P>The third was Mi&s;s Barnevelt, a Lady of ma&s;culine features, and who&s;e mind belied not tho&s;e features; for &s;he has the character of being loud, bold, free, even fierce when oppo&s;ed; and affects at all times &s;uch airs of contempt of her own Sex, that one almo&s;t wonders at her conde&s;cending to wear petticoats.</P>
<P>The gentlemens names were Walden and Single|ton; the fir&s;t, an Oxford &s;cholar of family and for|tune; but quaint and opinionated, de&s;pi&s;ing every one who has not had the benefit of an Univer&s;ity education.</P>
<P>Mr. Singleton is an harmle&s;s man; who is, it &s;eems, the object of more ridicule, even down to his very name, among all his acquaintance, than I think he by any means ought, con&s;idering the apparent in|offen&s;ivene&s;s of the man, who did not give <HI>him&s;elf</HI> his intellects; and his con&s;tant good humour, which might intitle him to better quarter; the rather too as he has one point of knowlege, which tho&s;e who think them&s;elves his &s;uperiors in under&s;tanding, do not al|ways attain, the knowlege of him&s;elf; for he is hum|ble, mode&s;t, ready to confe&s;s an inferiority to every one: And as laughing at a je&s;t is by &s;ome taken for high applau&s;e, he is ever the fir&s;t to be&s;tow that com|mendation on what others &s;ay; tho' it mu&s;t be own|ed, he now-and-then mi&s;takes for a je&s;t, what is none: Which, however, may be generally more the fault of the &s;peakers than of Mr. Singleton; &s;ince he takes his cue from their &s;miles, e&s;pecially when tho&s;e are &s;econded by the laugh of one of whom he has a good opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="60">
Mr. Singleton is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good e&s;tate which makes amends for many defects: He has a turn, it is &s;aid, to the well-managing of it; and no|body under&s;tands his own intere&s;t better than he; by which knowlege, he has opportunities to lay obliga|tions upon many of tho&s;e, who behind his back think them&s;elves intitled, by their &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uperior &s;en&s;e, to deride him: And he is ready enough to ob|lige in this way: But it is always on &s;uch &s;ecurities, that he has never given cau&s;e for &s;pendthrifts to laugh at him on that account.</P>
<P>It is thought that the friends of the fair Cantillon would not be aver&s;e to an alliance with this gentle|man: While I, were I <HI>his</HI> &s;i&s;ter, &s;hould rather wi&s;h, that he had &s;o much wi&s;dom in his weakne&s;s, as to de|vote him&s;elf to the worthier Pulcheria Clements (La|dy Betty's wi&s;h as well as mine) who&s;e fortune, tho' not de&s;picable, and who&s;e humbler views, would make her think her&s;elf repaid the obligation &s;he would lay him under, by her acceptance of him.</P>
<P>No-body, it &s;eems, thinks of an <HI>husband</HI> for Mi&s;s Barnevelt. She is &s;neeringly &s;poken of rather as a <HI>young fellow,</HI> than as a woman; and who will one day look out for a <HI>wife</HI> for her&s;elf. One rea&s;on in|deed, &s;he every-where gives, for being &s;atisfied with being a woman; which is, <HI>that &s;he cannot be married to a</HI> WOMAN.</P>
<P>An odd creature, my dear. But &s;ee what women get by going out of character. Like the Bats in the fable, they are look'd upon as mortals of a doubtful &s;pecies, hardly owned by either, and laugh'd at by both.</P>
<P>This was the company, and all the company, be|&s;ides us, that Lady Betty expected. But mutual civi|lities had hardly pa&s;&s;ed, when Lady Betty, having been called out, return'd, introducing, as a gentle|man, who would be acceptable to every one, Sir Har|grave Pollexfen. He is, whi&s;per'd &s;he to me, as he
<PB N="54" REF="61">
&s;aluted the re&s;t of the company, in a very gallant manner, a young Baronet of a very large e&s;tate, the greate&s;t part of which has lately come to him by the death of a grandmother, and two uncles, all very rich.</P>
<P>When he was pre&s;ented to me, by name, and I to him, I think my&s;elf very happy, &s;aid he, in being ad|mitted to the pre&s;ence of a young Lady, &s;o celebrated for her graces of per&s;on and mind. Then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Lady Betty, Much did I hear, when I was at the la&s;t Northampton races, of Mi&s;s Byron: But lit|tle did I expect to find report fall &s;o &s;hort of what I &s;ee.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cantillon bridled, play'd with her fan, and look'd as if &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;lighted; a little &s;corn intermingled with the airs &s;he gave her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Clements &s;miled, and look'd plea&s;ed, as if &s;he enjoyed, good-naturedly, a compliment made to one of the Sex which &s;he adorns, by the goodne&s;s of her heart.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Barnevelt &s;aid, &s;he had, from the moment I fir&s;t entered, beheld me with the eye of a Lover. And freely taking my hand, &s;queezed it.&mdash;Charming crea|ture! &s;aid &s;he, as if addre&s;&s;ing to a country innocent, and perhaps expecting me to be cover'd with blu&s;hes and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Baronet, excu&s;ing him&s;elf to Lady Betty, a&s;|&s;ured her, that &s;he mu&s;t place this his bold intru&s;ion to the account of Mi&s;s Byron; he having been told that &s;he was to be there.</P>
<P>Whatever were his motive, Lady Betty &s;aid, he did her favour; and &s;he was &s;ure the whole company would think them&s;elves <HI>doubly</HI> obliged to Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>The Student look'd as if he thought him&s;elf eclip&s;ed by Sir Hargrave, and as if, in revenge, he was putting his fine &s;peeches into Latin, and trying them by the rules of grammar; a broken &s;entence from a cla&s;&s;ic author bur&s;ting from his lips; and at la&s;t, &s;tanding up, half on tip-toe (as if he wanted to look down upon
<PB N="55" REF="62">
the Baronet) he &s;tuck one hand in his &s;ide, and pa&s;&s;ed by him, ca&s;ting a contemptuous eye on his gaudy dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Singleton &s;miled, and look'd as if delighted with all he &s;aw and heard. Once, indeed, he try'd to &s;peak: His mouth actually open'd, to give pa&s;&s;age to his words; as &s;ometimes &s;eems to be his way before the words are quite ready: But he &s;at down &s;atisfied with the effort.</P>
<P>It is true, people who do not make them&s;elves con|temptible by affectation &s;hould not be de&s;pi&s;ed. Poor and rich, wi&s;e and unwi&s;e, we are all links of the &s;ame great chain. And you mu&s;t tell me, my dear, if I, in endeavouring to give true de&s;criptions of the per|&s;ons I &s;ee, incur the cen&s;ure I be&s;tow on others who de&s;pi&s;e any-one for defects they cannot help.</P>
<P>Will you forgive me, my dear, if I make this Let|ter as long as my la&s;t?</P>
<P>No, &s;ay.</P>
<P>Well then, I thank you for a freedom &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with our friend&s;hip: And I will conclude with a&s;&s;ure|ances, that I am, and ever will be,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>IT was convenient to me, Lucy, to break off ju&s;t where I did in my la&s;t; el&s;e I &s;hould not have been &s;o very &s;elf-denying as to &s;uppo&s;e you had no curio&s;ity to hear, what undoubtedly I wanted to tell. Two girls talking over a new &s;et of company, would my uncle Selby &s;ay, are not apt to break off very abrupt|ly; not &s;he e&s;pecially of the two, who has found out a fair excu&s;e to repeat every compliment made to her|&s;elf; and when perhaps there may be a new admirer in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="63">
May there &s;o, my uncle? And which of the gen|tlemen do you think the man? The Baronet, I war|rant, you gue&s;s.&mdash;And &s;o he is.</P>
<P>Well then, let me give you, Lucy, a &s;ketch of him. But con&s;ider; I form my accounts from what I have &s;ince been told, as well as from what I ob&s;erv|ed at the time.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave Pollexfen is hand&s;ome and genteel; pretty tall; about twenty-eight or thirty. His com|plexion is a little of the faire&s;t for a man, and a little of the pale&s;t. He has remarkably bold eyes; rather approaching to what we would call goggling; and he gives him&s;elf airs with them as if he wi&s;h'd to have them thought raki&s;h: Perhaps as a recommendation, in his opinion, to the Ladies. Mi&s;s Cantillon, on his back being turned, Lady Betty prai&s;ing his per&s;on, &s;aid, Sir Hargrave had the fine&s;t eyes &s;he ever &s;aw in a man. They were manly, <HI>meaning</HI> ones.</P>
<P>He is very voluble in &s;peech; but &s;eems to owe his volubility more to his want of doubt, than to the ex|traordinary merit of what he &s;ays. Yet he is thought to have &s;en&s;e; and if he could prevail upon him&s;elf to hear more, and &s;peak le&s;s, he would better de&s;erve the good opinion he thinks him&s;elf &s;ure of. But as he can &s;ay any-thing without he&s;itation, and excites a laugh by laughing him&s;elf at all he is going to &s;ay, as well as at what he has ju&s;t &s;aid, he is thought in|finitely agreeable by the gay, and by tho&s;e who wi&s;h to drown thought in merriment.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave, it &s;eems, has travelled: But he mu&s;t have carried abroad with him a great number of fol|lies, and a great deal of affectation, if he has left any of them behind him.</P>
<P>But, with all his foibles, he is &s;aid to be a man of enterprize and courage; and young Ladies, it &s;eems, mu&s;t take care how they laugh with him: For he makes ungenerous con&s;tructions to the di&s;advantage of a woman whom he can bring to &s;eem pleas'd with
<PB N="57" REF="64">
his je&s;ts. I will tell you hereafter, how I came to know this, and even wor&s;e, of him.</P>
<P>The ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent age &s;eems to be dre&s;s: No wonder, therefore, that &s;uch a man as Sir Hargrave aims to excel in it. What can be mi&s;be&s;towed by a man on his per&s;on, who values it more than his mind? But he would, in my opinion, better become his dre&s;s, if the pains he undoubtedly takes before he ventures to come into public, were le&s;s apparent: This I judge from his &s;olicitude to pre&s;erve all in exact order, when in company; for he forgets not to pay his re&s;pects to him&s;elf at every gla&s;s; yet does it with a &s;eeming con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, as if he would hide a vanity too appa|rent to be concealed; breaking from it, if he finds him&s;elf ob&s;erved, with an half-carele&s;s, yet &s;eemingly di&s;&s;atisfied air, pretending to have di&s;covered &s;omething ami&s;s in him&s;elf. This &s;eldom fails to bring him a compliment: Of which he &s;hews him&s;elf very &s;en&s;i|ble, by affectedly di&s;claiming the merit of it; perhaps with this &s;peech, bowing, with his &s;pread hand on his brea&s;t, waving his head to and fro&mdash;By my Soul, Madam (or Sir) you do me too much honour.</P>
<P>Such a man is Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. He placed him&s;elf next to the country girl; and laid him&s;elf out in fine &s;peeches to her, running on in &s;uch a manner, that I had not for &s;ome time an opportunity to con|vince him that I had been in company of gay people before. He would have it, that I was a perfect beauty, and he &s;uppo&s;ed me very young&mdash;Very &s;illy of cour&s;e: And gave him&s;elf &s;uch airs, as if he were &s;ure of my admiration.</P>
<P>I viewed him &s;teadily &s;everal times; and my eye once falling under his, as I was looking at him, I dare &s;ay, he at that moment pitied the poor fond heart, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was in tumults about him; when, at the very time, I was con&s;idering, whether, if I were obliged to have the one or the other, as a puni&s;hment for &s;ome great fault I had committed, my choice would
<PB N="58" REF="65">
fall on Mr. Singleton, or on him. I mean, &s;uppo&s;ing the former were not a remarkably ob&s;tinate man; &s;ince ob&s;tinacy in a weak man, I think, mu&s;t be wor&s;e than tyranny in a man of &s;en&s;e&mdash;If indeed a man of &s;en&s;e can be a tyrant.</P>
<P>A &s;ummons to dinner relieved me from his more par|ticular addre&s;&s;es, and placed him at a di&s;tance from me.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave, the whole time of dinner, received advantage from the &s;upercilious looks and behaviour of Mr. Walden; who &s;eemed, on every-thing the Baronet &s;aid, (and he was &s;eldom &s;ilent) half to de|&s;pi&s;e him; for he made at times &s;o many different mouths of contempt, that I thought it was impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>&s;ame</HI> features to expre&s;s them. I have been making mouths in the gla&s;s for &s;everal minutes, to try to recover &s;ome of Mr. Walden's, in order to de&s;cribe them to you, Lucy; but I cannot for my life &s;o di&s;tort my face as to enable me to give you a notion of one of them.</P>
<P>He might perhaps have been better ju&s;tified in &s;ome of his contempts, had it not been vi&s;ible, that the con&s;equence which he took from the Baronet, he gave to him&s;elf; and yet was as cen&s;urable one way, as Sir Hargrave was the other.</P>
<P>Mirth, however in&s;ipid, will occa&s;ion &s;miles; tho' &s;ometimes to the di&s;advantage of the mirthful. But gloom, &s;everity, moro&s;ene&s;s, will always di&s;gu&s;t, tho' in a Solomon. Mr. Walden had not been taught that: And indeed it might &s;eem a little ungrateful [Don't you think &s;o, Lucy?] if women failed to re|ward a man with their &s;miles, who &s;crupled not to make him&s;elf a&mdash;monkey (&s;hall I &s;ay?) to plea&s;e them.</P>
<P>Never before did I &s;ee the difference between the man of the Town, and the man of the College, di&s;played in a light &s;o &s;triking as in the&s;e two gen|tlemen in the conver&s;ation after dinner. The one
<PB N="59" REF="66">
&s;eemed re&s;olved not to be plea&s;ed; while the other laid him&s;elf out to plea&s;e every-body; and that in a manner &s;o much at his own expence, as frequently to bring into que&s;tion his under&s;tanding. By a <HI>&s;econd</HI> &s;illy thing he bani&s;h'd the remembrance of a <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> by a <HI>third</HI> the <HI>&s;econd;</HI> and &s;o on: And by continually laughing at his own ab&s;urdities, left us at liberty to &s;uppo&s;e that his folly was his choice; and that, had it not been to divert the company, he could have made a better figure.</P>
<P>Mr. Walden, as was evident by his &s;corn&s;ul brow, by the contemptuous motions of his lip, and by his whole face affectedly turn'd from the Baronet, grudged him the &s;mile that &s;at upon everyone's countenance; and for which, without di&s;tingui&s;hing whether it was a &s;mile of <HI>approbation</HI> or <HI>not,</HI> he look'd as if he pity'd us all, and as if he thought him&s;elf ca&s;t into unequal company. Nay, twice or thrice he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, in preference to every one el&s;e, to hone&s;t &s;impering Mr. Singleton: Who, for his part, as was evident, much better reli&s;hed the Baronet's flippances, than the dry &s;ignificance of the Student. For, whenever Sir Hargrave &s;poke, Mr. Singleton's mouth was open: But it was quite otherwi&s;e with him, when Mr. Wal|den &s;poke, even at the time that he paid him the di|&s;tinction of addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to him, as if he were the principal per&s;on in the company.</P>
<P>But one word, by the bye, Lucy&mdash;Don't you think it is very happy for us fooli&s;h women, that the gene|rality of the Lords of the <HI>creation</HI> are not much wi&s;er than our&s;elves? Or, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in other words, That <HI>over</HI>-wi&s;dom is as fooli&s;h a thing to the full, as <HI>moderate</HI> &s;olly?&mdash;But, hu&s;h! I have done&mdash;I know that at this place my Uncle will be ready to ri&s;e again&s;t me.</P>
<P>After dinner, Mr. Walden, not chu&s;ing to be any longer &s;o egregiou&s;ly eclip&s;ed by the man of the Town, put forth the Scholar.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="67">
By the way, let me a&s;k my uncle, if the word <HI>&s;cholar</HI> means not the <HI>learner,</HI> rather than the <HI>learned?</HI> If it originally means no more, I would &s;uppo&s;e that formerly the mo&s;t learned men were the mo&s;t mode&s;t, contenting them&s;elves with being thought but <HI>learners;</HI> a mode&s;ty well becoming a learned man; &s;ince, va&s;t is the field of &s;cience, as my revered fir&s;t in&s;tructor u&s;ed to &s;ay, and the more a man knows, the more he will find he has to know.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir Hargrave, &s;aid Mr. Walden, may I a&s;k you&mdash;You had a thought ju&s;t now, &s;peaking of Love and Beauty, which I know you mu&s;t have from Tibullus [And then he repeated the line in an heroic accent; and, pau&s;ing, look'd round upon us women] Which Univer&s;ity had the honour of fini&s;hing your &s;tudies, Sir Hargrave? I pre&s;ume you were brought up at one of them.</P>
<P>Not I, &s;aid the Baronet: A man, &s;urely, may read Tibullus, and Virgil too, without being indebted to either Univer&s;ity for his learning.</P>
<P>No man, Sir Hargrave, in my <HI>humble</HI> opinion [With a deci&s;ive air he &s;poke the word <HI>humble]</HI> can be well-grounded in any branch of learning, who has not been at one of our famous Univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>I never yet propo&s;ed, Mr. Walden, to qualify my|&s;elf for a degree. My Chaplain is a very pretty fel|low. He under&s;tands Tibullus, I believe [Immoderately laughing, and by his eyes ca&s;t in turn upon each per|&s;on at table, be&s;peaking a general &s;mile]&mdash;And of Oxford, as you are. And again he laughed: But his laugh was then &s;uch a one, as rather &s;hewed ridicule than mirth; a provoking laugh, &s;uch a one as Mr. Greville often affects when he is in a di&s;puta|tious humour, in order to da&s;h an opponent out of countenance, <HI>by getting the laugh,</HI> in&s;tead of the ar|gument, on his &s;ide.</P>
<P>My uncle, you know, will have it &s;ometimes, that his girl has a &s;atirical vein. I am afraid &s;he has&mdash;
<PB N="61" REF="68">
A bold hu&s;&s;y!&mdash;But this I will &s;ay, I mean no ill-na|ture: I love every-body; but not their faults; as my uncle in his Letter tells <HI>me:</HI> And wi&s;h not to be &s;pared for my own. Nor, very probably, <HI>am</HI> I, if tho&s;e who &s;ee me, write <HI>of</HI> me to their cho&s;en friends as I do to mine, of them. Shall I tell you what I imagine each per&s;on of the company I am writing about (writing in character) would &s;ay of me to <HI>their</HI> corre&s;pondents?&mdash;It would be digre&s;&s;ing too much, or I would.</P>
<P>Mr. Walden in his heart, I dare &s;ay, was revenged on the Baronet. He gave him &s;uch a look, as would have grieved me the whole day, had it been given me by one whom I valued.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave had too much bu&s;ine&s;s for his eyes with the Ladies, in order to obtain their countenance, to trouble him&s;elf about the looks of the men. And indeed he &s;eemed to have as great a contempt for Mr. Walden, as Mr. Walden had for him.</P>
<P>But here I &s;hall be too late for the po&s;t. Will this &s;tuff go down with you at Selby-hou&s;e, in want of better &s;ubjects?</P>
<P>Every thing from you, my Harriet&mdash;</P>

<P>WHAT is your opinion, my charming Mi&s;s By|ron? &s;aid the Baronet: May not a man of for|tune, who has not receiv'd his education and <HI>poli&s;h</HI> [He pronounced the word <HI>poli&s;h</HI> with an empha&s;is, and another laugh] at an Univer&s;ity, make as good a figure in &s;ocial life, and as ardent a Lover, as if he had?</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="69">
I would have been &s;ilent: But, &s;taring in my face, he repeated, What &s;ay <HI>you</HI> to this, Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P>The World, Sir Hargrave, I have heard called an Univer&s;ity: But, in my humble opinion, neither a learned, nor what is called a <HI>fine</HI> education, has any other value than as each tends to improve the morals of men, and to make them wi&s;e and good.</P>
<P><HI>The world an Univer&s;ity!</HI> repeated Mr. Walden. Why, truly, looking up to Sir Hargrave's face, and then down to his feet, di&s;dainfully, as if he would mea&s;ure him with his eye, I cannot but &s;ay, twi&s;ting his head on one &s;ide, and with a drolling accent, that the world produces very pretty &s;cholars&mdash;for the Ladies&mdash;</P>
<P>The Baronet took fire at being &s;o contemptuou&s;ly mea&s;ured by the eye of the Scholar; and I thought it was not ami&s;s, for fear of high words between them, to put my&s;elf forward.</P>
<P>And are not women, Mr. Walden, re&s;umed I, one half in number, tho' not perhaps in value, of the human &s;pecies?&mdash;Would it not be pity, Sir, if the knowlege that is to be obtained in the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> Univer|&s;ity &s;hould make a man de&s;pi&s;e what is to be acquired in the <HI>greater,</HI> in which that knowlege was principally intended to make him u&s;eful?</P>
<P>This diverted the Baronet's anger: Well, Mr. Walden, &s;aid he, exultingly rubbing his hands, what &s;ay you to the young Lady's ob&s;ervation? By my Soul it is worth your notice. You may carry it down with you to <HI>your</HI> Univer&s;ity; and the be&s;t &s;cholars there will not be the wor&s;e for attending to it.</P>
<P>Mr. Walden &s;eemed to collect him&s;elf, as if he were inclined to con&s;ider me with more attention than he had given me before; and waving his hand, as if he would put by the Baronet, as an adver&s;ary he had done with, I am to thank you, madam, &s;aid he, it &s;eems, for your ob&s;ervation. And &s;o the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> Univer&s;ity&mdash;</P>

I have great veneration, Mr. Walden, interrupted I, for learning, and great honour for learned men&mdash;But this is a &s;ubject&mdash;</P>

<P>I am &s;orry to hear you &s;ay &s;o, Sir&mdash;But indeed I mu&s;t.</P>
<P>The company &s;eemed plea&s;ed to &s;ee me &s;o likely to be drawn in; and this encouraged Mr. Walden to pu&s;h his weak adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>Know you, madam, &s;aid he, any-thing of the learned languages?</P>
<P>No, indeed, Sir&mdash;Nor do I know which, particu|larly, you call &s;o.</P>
<P>The Greek, the Latin, madam.</P>
<P>Who, I, a woman, know any thing of Latin and Greek! I know but one Lady who is mi&s;tre&s;s of both; and &s;he finds her&s;elf &s;o much an owl among the birds, that &s;he wants of all things to be thought to have unlearned them.</P>
<P>Why, Ladies, I cannot but <HI>&s;ay,</HI> that I &s;hould ra|ther choo&s;e to marry a woman whom I could teach &s;omething, than one who would think her&s;elf quali|fied to teach me.</P>
<P>Is it a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> con&s;equence, Sir, &s;aid Mi&s;s Cle|ments, that knowlege, which makes a man &s;hine, &s;hould make a woman vain and pragmatical?

<P>We know, Mi&s;s Clements, replied Mr. Walden, that you are a well-read Lady. But I have nothing to &s;ay to ob&s;ervations that are in every-body's mouth&mdash;Pardon me, Madam.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="71">
Indeed, Sir, &s;aid Mr. Reeves, I think Mi&s;s Cle|ments &s;hould <HI>not</HI> pardon you. There is, in my opinion, great force in what &s;he hinted.</P>

<P>Pardon me, Sir. But I cannot return the compli|ment. I cannot argue.</P>
<P>And yet, madam, I will not let you go off &s;o ea&s;ily. You &s;eem to be very happy in your elocution, and to have &s;ome pretty notions, for &s;o young a Lady.</P>

<P>Every one made the &s;ame reque&s;t. I was &s;ilent, look'd down, and play'd with my fan.</P>
<P>When Mr. Walden had liberty to &s;ay what he plea&s;ed, he &s;eemed at a lo&s;s him&s;elf, for words.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, I a&s;ked you, madam, I a&s;ked you (he&s;i|tatingly began he) whether you knew any thing of the learned languages? It has been whi&s;pered to me, that you have had great advantages from a grand|father, of who&s;e learning and politene&s;s we have heard much. He was a &s;cholar. He was of Chri&s;t's, in our Univer&s;ity, if I am not mi&s;taken&mdash;To my que&s;tion you an&s;wered, That you knew not particularly which were the languages that I called the learned ones: and you have been plea&s;ed to throw out hints in rela|tion to the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> and to the <HI>greater</HI> Univer&s;ity; by all which you certainly mean &s;omething&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, Mr. Walden, &s;aid I&mdash;</P>
<P>And pray, Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;I am afraid of all &s;matterers in learning. Tho&s;e who know a little&mdash;and Ladies cannot know to the bottom&mdash;They have not the hap|pine&s;s of an Univer&s;ity education&mdash;</P>
<P>Nor is every man at the <HI>Univer&s;ity,</HI> I pre&s;ume, Sir, a Mr. Walden.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="72">
He took it for a compliment&mdash;Why, as to that, madam&mdash;bowing&mdash;But this is a misfortune <HI>to</HI> Ladies, not a fault <HI>in</HI> them&mdash;But, as I was going to &s;ay, Tho&s;e who know little, are very &s;eldom &s;ound, are very &s;eldom orthodox, as we call it, whether re&s;pecting <HI>religion</HI> or <HI>learning:</HI> And as it &s;eems you lo&s;t your Grandfather too early to be well-grounded in the latter (in the for|mer Lady Betty, who is my informant, &s;ays, you are a very <HI>good</HI> young Lady) I &s;hould be glad to put you right if you happen to be a little out of the way.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir, bowing, and (Simpleton!) &s;till playing with my fan. But, tho' Mr. Reeves &s;aid no|thing, he did not think me very politely treated. Yet he wanted, he told me afterwards, to have me drawn out. He &s;hould not have &s;erved me &s;o, I told him; e&s;pecially among &s;trangers, and men.</P>
<P>Now, madam, will you be plea&s;ed to inform me, &s;aid Mr. Walden, Whether you had any <HI>particular</HI> meaning, when you an&s;wered, that you knew not which I called the learned languages? You mu&s;t know, that the Latin and Greek are of tho&s;e &s;o called!</P>
<P>I beg, Mr. Walden, that I may not be thus &s;ingled out&mdash;Mr. Reeves&mdash;Sir&mdash;<HI>you</HI> have had Univer&s;ity-edu|cation. Pray relieve your cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves &s;miled, bowed his head, but &s;aid no|thing.</P>
<P>You were plea&s;ed, madam, proceeded Mr. Wal|den, to mention one learned Lady; and &s;aid that &s;he looked upon her&s;elf as an owl among the birds&mdash;</P>
<P>And you, Sir, &s;aid, that you had rather (and I believe mo&s;t men are of your mind) have a woman you could teach&mdash;</P>
<P>Than one who would &s;uppo&s;e &s;he could teach me. I did &s;o.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, and would you have me be guilty of an o&s;tentation that would bring me no credit, if I had had &s;ome pains taken with me in my education? But indeed, Sir, I know not any-thing of tho&s;e you call
<PB N="66" REF="73">
the learned languages. Nor do I take all learning to con&s;i&s;t in the knowlege of languages.</P>
<P><HI>All</HI> learning!&mdash;Nor I, madam&mdash;But if you place not learning in language, be &s;o good as to tell us what <HI>do</HI> you place it in?</P>
<P>He nodded his head with an air, as if he had &s;aid, This pretty Mi&s;s is got out of her depth. I believe I &s;hall have her now.</P>
<P>I would rather, Sir, &s;aid I, be an hearer than a &s;peaker; and the one would better become me than the other. I an&s;wered Sir Hargrave, becau&s;e he thought proper to apply to me.</P>
<P>And <HI>I,</HI> madam, apply to you likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, I have been taught to think, that a learned man and a lingui&s;t may very well be two per|&s;ons: In other words, That &s;cience, or knowlege, and not language merely, is learning.</P>
<P>Very well. Be plea&s;ed to proceed, madam.</P>
<P>Languages, I own, Sir, are of u&s;e, to let us into the knowlege for which &s;o many of the antients were famous&mdash;But&mdash;</P>
<P>Here I &s;topt. Every one's eyes were upon me. I was a little out of countenance.</P>
<P>In what a &s;ituation, Lucy, are we women?&mdash;If we have &s;ome little genius, and have taken pains to cul|tivate it, we mu&s;t be thought guilty of affectation, whether we appear de&s;irous to conceal it, or &s;ubmit to have it called forth.</P>
<P><HI>But,</HI> what, madam? Pray proceed, eagerly &s;aid Mr. Walden&mdash;<HI>But,</HI> what, madam?</P>
<P><HI>But</HI> have not the moderns, Sir, if I mu&s;t &s;peak, if they have equal genius's, the &s;ame heavens, the &s;ame earth, the &s;ame works of God, or of <HI>nature,</HI> as it is called, to contemplate upon, and improve by? The fir&s;t great genius's of all had not human example, had not human precepts&mdash;</P>
<P>Nor were the fir&s;t genius's <HI>of all</HI> (with an empha&s;is, replied Mr. Walden) &s;o perfect, as the ob&s;ervations
<PB N="67" REF="74">
of the genius's of after-times, which were built upon their foundations, made <HI>them;</HI> and <HI>they</HI> others. Learn|ing, or knowlege, as you choo&s;e to call it, was a pro|gre&s;&s;ive thing: And it became nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand the different languages in which the &s;ages of antiquity wrote, in order to avail our&s;elves of their learning.</P>
<P>Very right, Sir, I believe. You con&s;ider &s;kill in languages then as a <HI>vehicle</HI> to knowlege&mdash;Not, I pre|&s;ume, as <HI>&s;cience</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was &s;orry the Baronet laughed; becau&s;e his laugh|ing made it more difficult for me to get off, as I wanted to do.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir Hargrave, &s;aid Mr. Walden, let not <HI>every</HI> thing that is &s;aid be laughed at. I am fond of talking to this young Lady: And a conver&s;ation upon this topic may tend as much to <HI>edification,</HI> perhaps, as mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects with which we have been hi|therto <HI>entertained.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Hargrave took an empty gla&s;s, and with it hu|mourou&s;ly rapped his own knuckles, bowed, &s;miled, and was &s;ilent; by that act of yielding, which had gracefulne&s;s in it, gaining more honour to him&s;elf, than Mr. Walden obtained by his rebuke of him, however ju&s;t.</P>
<P>But this humourous acknowlegement hindered not Mr. Walden from &s;hewing, by a nod, given with an a&s;&s;uming air, that he thought he had obtained a victory over the Baronet: And then he again applied him&s;elf to me.</P>
<P>Now, madam, if you plea&s;e [and he put him&s;elf into a di&s;puting attitude] a word or two with you, on your <HI>vehicle,</HI> and &s;o-&s;orth.</P>
<P>Pray &s;pare me, Sir: I am willing to &s;it down quietly. I am unequal to this &s;ubject. I have done.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid the Baronet, you mu&s;t <HI>not</HI> &s;it down quiet|ly, madam: Mr. Walden has promi&s;ed us <HI>edification;</HI> and we all attend the effect of his promi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="75">
No, no, madam, &s;aid Mr. Walden, you mu&s;t not come off &s;o ea&s;ily. You have thrown out &s;ome ex|traordinary things for a <HI>Lady,</HI> and e&s;pecially for &s;o young a Lady. From <HI>you</HI> we expect the opinions of your worthy grandfather, as well as your own no|tions. He no doubt told you, or you have read, that the competition &s;et on foot between the learning of the antients and moderns, has been the &s;ubject of much debate among the learned in the latter end of the la&s;t century.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I know nothing of the matter. I am <HI>not</HI> learned. My grandfather was chiefly intent to make me an Engli&s;h, and, I may &s;ay, a <HI>Bible</HI> &s;cholar. I was very young when I had the misfortune to lo&s;e him. My whole endeavour has been &s;ince, that the pains he took with me, &s;hould not be ca&s;t away.</P>
<P>I have di&s;covered you, madam, to be a <HI>Parthian</HI> Lady. You can fight flying, I &s;ee. You mu&s;t not, I tell you, come off &s;o ea&s;ily for what you have thrown out. Let me a&s;k you, Did you ever read <HI>The Tale of a Tub?</HI></P>
<P>The Baronet laughed-out, tho' evidently in the wrong place.</P>
<P>How apt are laughing &s;pirits, &s;aid Mr. Walden, looking &s;olemnly, to laugh, when perhaps they ought&mdash;There he &s;topt&mdash;<HI>[to be laugh'd at,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he had in his head]. But I will not, however, be laugh'd out of my que&s;tion&mdash;Have you, madam, read Swift's <HI>Tale of a Tub?</HI>&mdash;There is <HI>&s;uch</HI> a book, Sir Hargrave; looking with a leer of contempt at the Baronet.</P>
<P>I know there is, Mr. Walden, replied the Baronet, and again laughed&mdash;<HI>Have you,</HI> madam; to me? Pray let us know, what Mr. Walden drives at.</P>
<P>I have, Sir.</P>
<P>Why then, madam, re&s;umed Mr. Walden, you no doubt read, bound up with it, <HI>The Battle of the Books;</HI> a very fine piece, written in favour of the an|tients, and again&s;t the moderns; and thence mu&s;t be
<PB N="69" REF="76">
acquainted with the famous di&s;pute I mentioned. And this will &s;hew you, that the moderns are but pygmies in &s;cience compared to the antients. And, pray, &s;hall not the knowlege which enables us, to under&s;tand and to dige&s;t the wi&s;dom of the&s;e immortal antients, be accounted learning?&mdash;Pray, madam, nodding his head, an&s;wer me that.</P>
<P>O how the&s;e pedants, whi&s;pered Sir Hargrave to Mr. Reeves, &s;trut in the livery and bra&s;s buttons of the antients, and call their &s;ervility, learning!</P>
<P>You are going beyond my learning, or capacity, Sir. I mu&s;t agree, that the knowlege which enables us to comprehend the wi&s;dom of the antients, and to be improved by it, de&s;erves to be called learning. Yet the antients may be read, I &s;uppo&s;e, and not under|&s;tood?&mdash;But pray, Sir, let the Parthian fly the field. I promi&s;e you that &s;he will not return to the charge. <HI>E&s;cape,</HI> not <HI>victory,</HI> is all &s;he contends for.</P>
<P>All in good time, madam&mdash;But who, pray, learns the language but with a view to under&s;tand the au|thor?</P>
<P>No-body, I believe, Sir. But yet &s;ome who read the antients, may fail of under&s;tanding them, or at lea&s;t, of improving by them; for every &s;cholar, I pre&s;ume, is not, nece&s;&s;arily, a man of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The Baronet was wicked here, in pointing by a laugh, as particular &s;atire, what I meant but as ge|neral ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the knowlege of the&s;e antients, con|tinued I, as great as you plea&s;e, is it not to be lament|ed; is it not, indeed, &s;trange, that none of the modern learned, notwith&s;tanding the advantage of <HI>their</HI> works (mo&s;t of which they have taught to &s;peak our language); notwith&s;tanding the later important di&s;coveries in many branches of &s;cience; notwith&s;tanding a Revela|tion from Heaven, to which the religion of the Pagans was <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> (and on which fooli&s;hne&s;s, however, I am told, mo&s;t of the works of antiquity are founded);
<PB N="70" REF="77">
&s;hould have de&s;erved a higher con&s;ideration in the compari&s;on, than as <HI>pygmies</HI> to <HI>giants?</HI></P>
<P>I was going to &s;ay &s;omething farther; but the Ba|ronet, by his loud applau&s;es, di&s;concerted me; and I was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Proceed, madam.&mdash;No triumph, no cau&s;e of tri|umph, here, Sir Hargrave!&mdash;Pray, madam, proceed&mdash;You have not done, I perceive.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be very glad, Sir, to have done. Pray change either the &s;ubject, or choo&s;e another di&s;putant.</P>
<P>Every one called upon me to proceed; and Mr. Walden urged me to &s;ay what I was going to &s;ay.</P>
<P>But will you not, my Lucy, be glad of a little re|lief from this argument.&mdash;Yes, &s;ay.</P>
<P>Here then I conclude this Letter, to begin another. But it mu&s;t be after I return from the play this night, or early in the morning before I go to church.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>URGED thus by every one, What I had further in my thoughts to &s;ay, re&s;umed I, was from what I read in my Bible. The fir&s;t man &s;eems to have had an intuitive knowlege given him of almo&s;t all that concerned him to know: And his early de&s;cendants, while there was but <HI>one</HI> language, and long before the Greek and Roman &s;ages exi&s;ted, under&s;tood Hu&s;band|ry and Mu&s;ic, were Artificers in Bra&s;s and Iron, built that &s;urpri&s;ing naval &s;tructure the Ark; attempted a yet greater piece of architecture, the Tower of Babel; and therefore mu&s;t have had &s;kill in many other parts of &s;cience which are not particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>And &s;o, madam, you really &s;eem to think, that the knowlege we gather from the great antients is hardly worth the pains we take in acquiring the languages in which they wrote?</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="78">
Not &s;o, Sir. I have great re&s;pect even for <HI>lingui&s;ts:</HI> Do we not owe to them the tran&s;lation of the &s;acred Books?&mdash;But methinks I could wi&s;h that &s;uch a di&s;tin|ction &s;hould be made between <HI>language</HI> and <HI>&s;cience,</HI> as &s;hould convince me, that That confu&s;ion of tongues, which was intended for a puni&s;hment of pre&s;umption in the early ages of the world, &s;hould not be thought to give us our greate&s;t glory in the&s;e <HI>more enlightened</HI> times.</P>
<P>Well, madam, Ladies mu&s;t be treated as Ladies. But I &s;hall have great plea&s;ure, on my return to Ox|ford, in being able to acquaint my learned friends, that they mu&s;t all turn fine gentlemen and <HI>laughers</HI> [Mr. Reeves had &s;miled as well as the Baronet] and de&s;pi&s;e the great antients as men of &s;traw, or very &s;hortly they will &s;tand no chance in the Ladies favour.</P>
<P>Good Mr. Walden! Good Mr. Walden! laughed the Baronet, &s;haking his embroider'd &s;ides, let me, let me, beg your patience, while I tell you, that the young gentlemen at both Univer&s;ities, are already in more danger of becoming <HI>fine gentlemen</HI> than <HI>fine &s;cholars</HI>&mdash;And then again he laughed; and looking round him, be&s;poke, in his u&s;ual way, a laugh from the re&s;t of the company.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves, a little touch'd at the &s;cholar's reference to him, in the word <HI>laughers,</HI> &s;aid, It were to be wi&s;h'd, that in all nur&s;eries of learning, the <HI>manners</HI> of youth were propo&s;ed as the principal end. It is too known a truth, &s;aid he, that the attention paid to lan|guages, has too generally &s;wallowed up all other and more important con&s;iderations; in&s;omuch that &s;ound morals and good breeding them&s;elves, are obliged to give way to that which is of little moment, but as it promotes and inculcates tho&s;e. And learned men, I am per&s;uaded, if they <HI>dared</HI> to &s;peak out, would not lay &s;o much &s;tre&s;s upon languages as you, Mr. Walden, &s;eem to do.</P>
<P>Learning <HI>here,</HI> reply'd Mr. Walden, a little peevi&s;h|ly,
<PB N="72" REF="79">
has not a fair tribunal to be try'd at. As it is &s;aid of the advantages of birth or degree, &s;o it may be &s;aid of learning; No one de&s;pi&s;es it that has preten&s;ions to it. But, proceed, Mi&s;s Byron, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Very true, I believe, Sir, &s;aid I: But, on the other hand, may not tho&s;e who have either, or both, value them&s;elves too much on that account? I knew once an excellent &s;cholar, who thought, that too great a por|tion of life was be&s;towed in the learning of languages; and that the works of many of the antients were more to be admired for the &s;tamp which antiquity has fixed upon them, and for the &s;ake of their purity in languages that cannot alter (and who&s;e works are therefore be|come the &s;tandard of tho&s;e languages) than for the lights obtained from them by men of genius, in ages that we have rea&s;on to think more enlightened, as well by new di&s;coveries as by revelation.</P>
<P>And then I was going to a&s;k, whether the reputa|tion of learning was not oftener acquir'd by &s;kill in tho&s;e branches of &s;cience which principally &s;erve for amu&s;ement to inqui&s;itive and curious minds, than by that in the more u&s;eful &s;ort: But Mr. Walden broke in upon me with an air that had &s;everity in it.</P>
<P>I could <HI>almo&s;t</HI> wi&s;h, &s;aid he (and <HI>but</HI> almo&s;t, as you are a <HI>Lady)</HI> that you knew the works of the great an|tients in their original languages.</P>
<P>Something, &s;aid Mi&s;s Clements, &s;hould be left for <HI>men</HI> to excel in. I cannot but approve of Mr. Wal|den's word <HI>almo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>She then whi&s;per'd me; Pray, Mi&s;s Byron, proceed (for &s;he &s;aw me a little out of countenance at Mr. Walden's &s;evere air)&mdash;Strange, added &s;he, &s;till whi&s;|pering, that people who know lea&s;t how to argue, &s;hould be mo&s;t di&s;putatious. Thank Heaven, all &s;cholars are not like this.</P>
<P>A little encouraged, Pray, Sir, &s;aid I, let me a&s;k one que&s;tion&mdash;Whether you do not think, that our Milton, in his <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> &s;hews him&s;elf to be a
<PB N="73" REF="80">
very learned man:&mdash;And yet that work is written wholly in the language of his own country, as the works of Homer and Virgil were in the language of theirs:&mdash;And they, I pre&s;ume, will be allowed to be learned men.</P>
<P>Milton, madam, let me tell you, is infinitely ob|liged to the great antients; and his very frequent allu|&s;ions to them, and his knowlege of their mythology, &s;hew that he is.</P>
<P>His knowlege of their mythology, Sir!&mdash;His own &s;ubject &s;o greatly, &s;o nobly, &s;o divinely, above that mythology!&mdash;I have been taught to think, by a very learned man, that it was a conde&s;cen&s;ion in Milton to the ta&s;te of per&s;ons of more reading than genius, in the age in which he wrote, to introduce, &s;o often as he does, his allu&s;ions to the pagan mythology: And that he neither rai&s;ed his &s;ublime &s;ubject, nor did credit to his va&s;t genius, by it.</P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;ion, &s;aid Mr. Walden, is a writer admired by the <HI>Ladies.</HI> Mr. Addi&s;on, madam, as you will find in your Spectators [Sneeringly he &s;poke this] gives but the &s;econd place to Milton, on comparing &s;ome pa&s;&s;age of his with &s;ome of Homer.</P>
<P>If Mr. Addi&s;on, Sir, has not the honour of being admired by the <HI>gentlemen,</HI> as well as the <HI>ladies;</HI> I dare &s;ay Mr. Walden will not allow, that his authority &s;hould decide the point in que&s;tion: And yet, as I remember, he greatly extols Milton.&mdash;But I am going out of my depth&mdash;Only permit me to &s;ay one thing more&mdash;If Homer is to be preferred to Milton, he mu&s;t be the &s;ublime&s;t of writers; and Mr. Pope, admirable as his tran&s;lation of the Iliad is &s;aid to be, cannot have done him ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>You &s;eem, madam, to be a very deep <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;cho|lar. But &s;ay you this from your own ob&s;ervation, or from that of any other?</P>
<P>I readily own, that my lights are borrowed, replied I. I owe the ob&s;ervation to my godfather Mr. Deane.
<PB N="74" REF="81">
He is a &s;cholar; but a greater admirer of Milton than of any of the antients. A gentleman, his particular friend, who was as great an admirer of Homer, un|dertook from Mr. Pope's tran&s;lation of the Iliad, to produce pa&s;&s;ages that in &s;ublimity exceeded any in the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t. The gentlemen met at Mr. Deane's hou&s;e, where I then was. They allowed me to be pre&s;ent; and this was the i&s;&s;ue: The gentleman went away convinced, that the Engli&s;h poet as much ex|celled the Grecian in the grandeur of his &s;entiments, as his &s;ubject, founded on the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, &s;urpa&s;&s;es the pagan.</P>
<P>The debate, I have the vanity to think, &s;aid Mr. Walden, had <HI>I</HI> been a party in it, would have taken another turn.</P>
<P>The baronet expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf highly delighted with me, and was running over with the prai&s;es he had heard given me at la&s;t Northampton races; when I en|deavoured to &s;top him, by &s;aying, Surely, Sir, it mu&s;t be your too low opinion of the qualifications of our Sex, that can induce you to think &s;uch obvious remarks as I have been drawn in to make, at all con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>But this hindered not Sir Hargrave from being even noi&s;y in his applau&s;es. He would have it, that I mu&s;t know a va&s;t deal, becau&s;e I happened to touch upon &s;ome things that had not taken <HI>his</HI> attention. He drowned the voice of Mr. Walden, who two or three times was earne&s;t to &s;peak; but not finding him&s;elf heard, drew up his mouth as if to a contemptuous whi&s;tle, &s;hrugg'd his &s;houlders, and &s;at collected in his own con&s;cious worthine&s;s: His eyes, however, were often ca&s;t upon the pictures that hung round the room, as much better objects than the living ones before him.</P>
<P>But what extremely di&s;concerted me, was, a freedom of Mi&s;s Barnevelt's; taken upon what I la&s;t &s;aid, and upon Mr. Walden's he&s;itation, and Sir Hargrave's ap|plau&s;es: She pro&s;e&s;&s;ed that I was able to bring <HI>her own</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="82">
<HI>Sex</HI> into reputation with her. Wi&s;dom, as I call it, &s;aid &s;he, notwith&s;tanding what you have mode&s;tly alleged to depreciate your own, proceeding thro'teeth of ivory, and lips of coral, give a grace to every word. And then cla&s;ping one of her manni&s;h arms round me, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed my cheek.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed, and offended; and with the more rea&s;on, as Sir Hargrave, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, declared, that &s;ince merit was to be approved in that manner, he thought him&s;elf obliged to follow &s;o good an ex|ample.</P>
<P>I &s;tood up, and &s;aid, Surely, Sir, my compliance with the reque&s;t of the company, too much I fear at my own expence, calls rather for civility than freedom, from a gentleman. I beg, Sir Hargrave&mdash;There I &s;topt; and I am &s;ure looked greatly in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>He &s;tood &s;u&s;pended till I had &s;peaking; and then, bowing, &s;at down again; but, as Mr. Reeves told me afterwards, he whi&s;pered a great oath in his ear, and declared, that he beheld with tran&s;port his future wife; and cur&s;ed him&s;elf if he would ever have another; vowing, in the &s;ame whi&s;per, that were a thou&s;and men to &s;tand in his way, he would not &s;cruple any means to remove them.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Barnevelt only laughed at the freedom &s;he had taken with me. She is a loud and fearle&s;s laugher. She hardly knows how to &s;mile: For as &s;oon as any|thing catches her fancy, her voice immediately bur&s;ts her lips, and widens her mouth to its full extent&mdash;For|give me, Lucy: I believe I am &s;piteful.</P>
<P>Lady Betty and Mi&s;s Clements, in low voices, prai&s;ed me for my pre&s;ence of mind, as they called it, in check|ing Sir Hargrave's forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t here, Lucy, I laid down my pen, and &s;tept to the gla&s;s, to &s;ee whether I could not plea&s;e my&s;elf with a wi&s;e frown or two; at lea&s;t with a &s;olemnity of countenance, that, occa&s;ionally, I might da&s;h with it my childi&s;hne&s;s of look; which certainly encouraged
<PB N="76" REF="83">
this freedom of Mi&s;s Barnevelt. But I could not plea&s;e my&s;elf. My mu&s;cles have never been u&s;ed to any-thing but &s;miling: So favoured, &s;o beloved, by every one of my dear friends; an heart &s;o grateful for all their fa|vours&mdash;How can I learn now to frown; or even long to look grave?</P>
<P>All this time the &s;cholar &s;at <HI>unea&s;ily-carele&s;s.</HI> Can you connect together, my Lucy, ideas &s;o very different as the&s;e two words joined will give you?</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Reeves, having &s;ent for from his &s;tudy, Bi&s;hop Burnet's Hi&s;tory of his own Times, &s;aid he would, by way of moderator&s;hip in the pre|&s;ent debate, read them a pa&s;&s;age, to which he be|lieved all parties would &s;ub&s;cribe: And then read what I will tran&s;cribe for you from the conclu&s;ion to that performance:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I have often thought it a great error to wa&s;te young gentlemens years &s;o long in learning Latin, by &s;o tedious a grammar. I know tho&s;e who are bred to the profe&s;&s;ion in literature, mu&s;t have the Latin correctly; and for that the rules of grammar are nece&s;&s;ary: But the&s;e rules are not at all requi&s;ite to tho&s;e, who need only &s;o much Latin, as thorough|ly to under&s;tand and delight in the Roman authors and poets. But &s;uppo&s;e a youth had, either for want of memory, or of application, an incurable a ver&s;ion to Latin, his education is not for that to be de&s;pair|ed of: There is much noble knowlege to be had in the Engli&s;h and French languages: Geography, Hi&s;tory, chiefly that of our own country, the know|lege of Nature, and the more <HI>practical</HI> parts of the Mathematics (if he has not a genius for the <HI>demon|&s;trative)</HI> may make a gentleman very knowing, tho' he has not a word of Latin' [And why, I would fain know, &s;aid Mr. Reeves, not a gentlewoman?] 'There is a finene&s;s of thought, and a noblene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, indeed, in the Latin authors' [This makes for your argument, Mr. Walden] 'that will make
<PB N="77" REF="84">
them the entertainment of a man's whole life, if he once under&s;tands and reads them with delight' [Very well, &s;aid Mr. Walden!]: 'But if this cannot be attained to, I would not have it reckoned that the education of an ill Latin &s;cholar is to be given over.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus far the Bi&s;hop. We all know, proceeded Mr. Reeves, how well Mr. Locke has treated this &s;ubject. And he is &s;o far from di&s;couraging the fair Sex from learning languages, that he gives us a me|thod in his Treati&s;e of Education, by which a mother may not only learn Latin her&s;elf, but be able to teach it to her <HI>&s;on.</HI> Be not therefore, Ladies, a&s;hamed either of your talents or acquirements. Only take care, you give not up any knowlege that is more laudable in your Sex, and more u&s;eful, for learning; and then I am &s;ure, you will, you <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> be the more agreeable, the more &s;uitable companions to men of &s;en&s;e. Nor let any man have &s;o narrow a mind as to be apprehen|&s;ive for his own prerogative, from a learned woman. A woman who does not behave the <HI>better</HI> the more &s;he knows, will make her hu&s;band unea&s;y, and will think as well of her&s;elf, were &s;he utterly illiterate; nor would any argument convince her of her duty. Do not men marry with their eyes open? And cannot they court whom they plea&s;e? A conceited, a vain mind in a woman cannot be hid. Upon the whole, I think it may be fairly concluded, that the more a woman knows, as well as a man, the wi&s;er &s;he will generally be; and the more regard &s;he will have for a man of &s;en&s;e and learning.</P>
<P>Here ended Mr. Reeves. Mr. Walden was &s;ilent; yet &s;hrugged his &s;houlders, and &s;eemed un&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation then took a more general turn, in which every one bore a part. <HI>Plays, Fa&s;hion, Dre&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>Public Entertainments,</HI> were the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cantillon, who had till now &s;at a little unea&s;y, &s;eemed re&s;olved to make up for her &s;ilence: But did not
<PB N="78" REF="85">
&s;hine at all where &s;he thought her&s;elf mo&s;t intitled to make a figure.</P>
<P>But Mi&s;s Clements really &s;hone. Yet in the eye of &s;ome people, what advantages has folly in a pretty face, over even wi&s;dom in a plain one? Sir Hargrave was much more &s;truck with the pert things &s;poken, without fear or wit, by Mi&s;s Cantillon, than with the ju&s;t ob&s;ervations that fell from the lips of Mi&s;s Cle|ments.</P>
<P>Mr. Walden made no great figure on the&s;e fa&s;hion|able &s;ubjects; no, not on that of <HI>Plays:</HI> For he would needs force into conver&s;ation, with a preference to our Shake&s;peare, his Sophocles, his Euripides, his Terence; of the merits of who&s;e performances, except by tran&s;|lation, no one pre&s;ent but Mr. Reeves and him&s;elf, could judge.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave &s;poke well on the &s;ubject of the reign|ing fa&s;hions, and on modern dre&s;s, &s;o much the foible of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>Lady Betty and Mrs. Reeves &s;poke very properly of the decency of dre&s;s, and propriety of fa&s;hions, as well as of public entertainments.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Clements put in here al&s;o with advantage to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nor would Mr. Walden be excluded this topic. But, as the ob&s;ervations he made on it, went no deeper than what it was pre&s;umed he might have had at &s;e|cond-hand, he made a wor&s;e figure here, than he did on his more favourite &s;ubject. He was, however, heard, till he was for bringing in his Spartan jacket, I forget what he called it, de&s;cending only to the knees of the women, in place of hoops; and the Roman toga for the men.</P>
<P>My uncle will be plea&s;ed to remember, that Mr. Walden has given my letters the <HI>learned jaundice.</HI> Had not that gentleman been one of the company, not a word of all this jargon would my uncle have had from his Harriet. And yet all I have &s;aid is but
<PB N="79" REF="86">
from common reading. And, let me a&s;k, why, be|cau&s;e we know but little, we are to be &s;uppo&s;ed to know nothing?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Barnevelt broke in upon the Scholar; but by way of approbation of what he &s;aid; and went on with &s;ubjects of heroi&s;m, without permitting him to rally and proceed, as he &s;eemed inclined to do. After prai&s;ing what he &s;aid of the Spartan and Roman dre&s;&s;es, &s;he fell to enumerating <HI>her</HI> heroes, both antient and mo|dern. Achilles, the &s;avage Achilles, charmed her. Hector was a good <HI>clever</HI> man, however: Yet &s;he could not bear to think of his being &s;o mean as to beg for his life, tho' of her heroic Achilles. He de|&s;erved for it, &s;he &s;aid, to have his corp&s;e dragged round the Trojan walls at the wheels of the victor's chariot. Alexander the Great was her dear creature; and Julius Cae&s;ar was <HI>a very pretty fellow.</HI> The&s;e were Mi&s;s Barnevelt's <HI>antient</HI> heroes. Among the moderns, the great Scanderbeg, our Henry V. Henry IV. of France, Charles XII. of Sweden, and the great Czar Peter, who my grandfather u&s;ed to &s;ay was worth them all, were her favourites.</P>
<P>All this while hone&s;t Mr. Singleton had a &s;mile at the &s;ervice of every &s;peaker, and a loud laugh always ready at the baronet's.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave &s;eemed not a little plea&s;ed with the hone&s;t man's complai&s;ance; and always directed him|&s;elf to <HI>him,</HI> when he was di&s;po&s;ed to be merry. Laugh|ing, you know, my dear, is almo&s;t as catching as gaping, be the &s;ubject ever &s;o &s;illy: And more than once he &s;hewed by his eyes, that he could have devoured Mi&s;s Cantillon, for generally adding her affected Te-he (twi&s;ting and bridling behind her fan) to his louder, Hah, hah, hah, hah.</P>
<P>What a length have I run! How does this narra|tive Letter-writing, if one is to enter into minute and characteri&s;tic de&s;criptions and conver&s;ations, draw one on! I will leave off for the pre&s;ent. Yet have not
<PB N="80" REF="87">
quite di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the company (tho' I have done with the argument) that I thought to have parted with before I concluded this Letter.</P>
<P>But I know I &s;hall plea&s;e my uncle in the <HI>livelier</HI> parts of it, by the handle they will give him again&s;t me. My grandmother and aunt Selby will be plea&s;ed, and &s;o will <HI>you,</HI> my Lucy, with <HI>all</HI> I write, for the writer's &s;ake: Such is their and your partial Love to</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>BY the time tea was ready, Lady Betty whi&s;peringly congratulated me on having made &s;o con&s;iderable a conque&s;t, as &s;he was &s;ure I had, by Sir Hargrave's looks, in which was mingled reverence with admira|tion, as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf. She took notice al&s;o of a gallant expre&s;&s;ion of his, uttered, as &s;he would have it, with an earne&s;tne&s;s that gave it a meaning be|yond a common compliment. My cou&s;in Reeves had a&s;ked Mi&s;s Clements if &s;he could commend to me an hone&s;t, mode&s;t man-&s;ervant? <HI>I,</HI> &s;aid Sir Hargrave <HI>can.</HI> I my&s;elf &s;hall be proud to wear Mi&s;s Byron's livery; and that for life.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Cantillon, who was within hearing of this, and had &s;eemed to be highly taken with the baronet, could hardly let her eyes be civil to me; and yet her really pretty mouth, <HI>occa&s;ionally,</HI> worked it&s;elf into forced &s;miles, and an affectation of complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave was extremely ob&s;equious to me all the tea-time; and &s;eemed in <HI>earne&s;t</HI> a little unea&s;y in him&s;elf: And after tea he took my cou&s;in Reeves into the next room; and there made your Harriet the &s;ub|ject of a &s;erious conver&s;ation; and de&s;ired his intere&s;t with me.</P>
<P>He prefaced his declaration to Mr. Reeves, with
<PB N="81" REF="88">
a&s;&s;uring him, that he had &s;ought for an opportunity more than once, to be admitted into my company, when he was la&s;t at Northampton; and that he had not intruded him&s;elf then into this company, had he not heard I was to be there. He made prote&s;tations of his honourable views; which look'd as if he thought they might be doubted, if he had not given &s;uch a&s;&s;urances. A tacit implication of an imagined &s;uperiority, as well in con&s;equence as fortune.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves told him, It was a rule which all my relations had &s;et them&s;elves, not to interfere with my choice, let it be placed on whom it would.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave called him&s;elf an <HI>happy man</HI> upon this intelligence. He afterwards, on his return to com|pany, found an opportunity, as Mrs. Reeves and I were talking at the furthe&s;t part of the room, in very ve|hement terms, to declare him&s;elf to me an admirer of perfections of his own creation; for he volubly enumerated many; and begg'd my permi&s;&s;ion to pay his re&s;pects to me at Mr. Reeves's.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves, Sir Hargrave, &s;aid I, will receive what vi&s;its he plea&s;es in his own hou&s;e. I have no per|mi&s;&s;ion to give.</P>
<P>He bowed, and made me a very high compliment, taking what I &s;aid for a permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What can a woman do with the&s;e &s;elf-flatterers?</P>
<P>Mr. Walden took his leave: Sir Hargrave his: He wanted, I &s;aw, to &s;peak to me, at his departure; but I gave him no opportunity.</P>
<P>Mr. Singleton &s;eemed al&s;o inclined to go, but knew not how; and having lo&s;t the benefit of their example by his irre&s;olution, &s;at down.</P>
<P>Lady Betty then repeated her congratulations. How many Ladies, &s;aid &s;he, and fine Ladies too, have &s;igh'd in &s;ecret for Sir Hargrave. You will have the glory, Mi&s;s Byron, of fixing the wavering heart of a man who has done, and is capable of doing, a great deal of mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="89">
The Ladies, madam, &s;aid I, who can &s;igh in &s;ecret for &s;uch a man as Sir Hargrave, mu&s;t either de&s;erve a great deal of pity, or none at all.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave, &s;aid Mi&s;s Cantillon, is a very fine gentleman; and &s;o looked upon, I a&s;&s;ure you: And he has a noble e&s;tate.</P>
<P>It is very happy, reply'd I, that we do not all of us like the &s;ame per&s;on. I mean not to di&s;parage Sir Hargrave; but I have compa&s;&s;ion for the Ladies who &s;igh for him in &s;ecret. One woman only can be his wife; and perhaps &s;he will not be one of tho&s;e who &s;igh for him; e&s;pecially were he to know that &s;he does.</P>
<P>Perhaps not, reply'd Mi&s;s Cantillon: But I do a&s;|&s;ure you, that I am not one of tho&s;e who &s;igh for Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P>The Ladies &s;miled.</P>
<P>I am glad of it, madam, &s;aid I. Every woman &s;hould have her heart in her own keeping, till &s;he can find a worthy man to  be&s;tow it upon.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Barnevelt took a tilt in heroics. Well, Ladies, &s;aid &s;he, you may talk of Love and Love as much as you plea&s;e; but it is my glory, that I never knew what Love was. I, for my part, like a brave man, a gallant man: One in who&s;e loud prai&s;e fame has crack'd half a dozen trumpets. But as to your milk|&s;ops, your dough-baked Lovers, who &s;tay at home and &s;trut among the women, when glory is to be gain'd in the martial field; I de&s;pi&s;e them with all my heart. I have often wi&s;h'd that the fooli&s;h heads of &s;uch fellows as the&s;e, were all cut off in time of war, and &s;ent over to the heroes to fill their cannon with, when they batter in breach, by way of &s;aving ball.</P>
<P>I am afraid, &s;aid Lady Betty, humouring this ro|mantic &s;peech, that if the heads of &s;uch per&s;ons were as &s;oft as we are apt &s;ometimes to think them, they would be of as little &s;ervice abroad as they are at home.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90">
O, madam, replied Mi&s;s Barnevelt, there is a good deal of lead in the heads of the&s;e fellows. But were their brains, &s;aid the &s;hocking creature, if any they have, made to fly about the ears of an enemy, they would &s;erve both to blind and terrify him.</P>
<P>Even Mr. Singleton was affected with this horrid &s;peech; for he clapt both his hands to his head, as if he were afraid of his brains.</P>
<P>Lady Betty was very urgent with us to pa&s;s the e|vening with her; but we excu&s;ed our&s;elves; and when we were in the coach, Mr. Reeves told me, that I &s;hould find the Baronet a very trouble&s;ome and re&s;o|lute Lover, if I did not give him countenance.</P>
<P>And &s;o, Sir, &s;aid I, you would have me do, as I have heard many a good woman <HI>has</HI> done, marry a man, in order to get rid of his importunity.</P>
<P>And a certain cure too, let me tell you, cou&s;in, &s;aid he, &s;miling.</P>
<P>We &s;ound at home, waiting for Mr. Reeves's re|turn, Sir John Alle&s;tree: A worthy &s;en&s;ible man, of plain and unaffected manners, upwards of fifty.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves mentioning to him our pa&s;t entertain|ment and company, Sir John gave us &s;uch an account of Sir Hargrave, as helped me not only in the cha|racter I have given of him, but let me know that he is a very dangerous and enterpri&s;ing man. He &s;ays, that laughing and light as he is in company, he is malici|ous, ill-natured, and de&s;igning; and &s;ticks at nothing to carry a point on which he has once &s;et his heart. He has ruined, Sir John &s;ays, three young creatures already under vows of marriage.</P>
<P>Sir John &s;poke of him as a managing man, as to his fortune: He &s;aid, That tho' he would at times be lavi&s;h in the pur&s;uit of his plea&s;ures; yet that he had &s;ome narrowne&s;&s;es which made him de&s;pi&s;ed, and that mo&s;t by tho&s;e for who&s;e regard a good man would principally wi&s;h; his neighbours and tenants.</P>
<P>Could you have thought, my Lucy, that this laugh|ing,
<PB N="84" REF="91">
fine-dre&s;&s;ing man, could have been a man of malice; of re&s;entment; of enterprize; a cruel man? Yet Sir John told two very bad &s;tories of him, be&s;ides what I have mentioned, which prove him to be all I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>But I had no need of the&s;e &s;tories to determine me again&s;t receiving his addre&s;&s;es. What I &s;aw of him was &s;ufficient; though Sir John made no manner of doubt (on being told by Mr. Reeves, in confidence, of his application to him for leave to vi&s;it me) that he was quite in earne&s;t; and, making me a compliment, added, that he knew Sir Hargrave was inclined to marry; and the more, as one half of his e&s;tate, on failure of i&s;&s;ue male, would go at his death to a di&s;tant relation whom he hated; but for no other rea&s;on than for admoni&s;hing him, when a &s;chool-boy, on his low and mi&s;chievous pranks.</P>
<P>His e&s;tate, Sir John told my cou&s;in, is full as con|&s;iderable as reported. And Mr. Reeves, after Sir John went away, &s;aid, What a glory will it be to you, cou&s;in Byron, to reform &s;uch a man, and make his great fortune a ble&s;&s;ing to multitudes; as I am &s;ure would be your endeavour to do, were you Lady Pol|lexfen!</P>
<P>But, my Lucy, were Sir Hargrave king of one half of the globe, I would not go to the altar with him.</P>
<P>But if he be a very trouble&s;ome man, what &s;hall I &s;ay to him? I can deal pretty well with tho&s;e, who will be kept at arms length; but I own, I &s;hould be very much perplex'd with re&s;olute wretches. The ci|vility I think my&s;elf obliged to pay every one who pro|&s;e&s;&s;es a regard for me, might &s;ubject me to inconve|niencies with violent &s;pirits, which, protected as I have been by my uncle Selby, and my good Mr. Deane, I never yet have known. O my Lucy, to what evils, but for that protection, might I not, as a &s;ole, an in|dependent young woman, have been expo&s;ed? Since men, many men, are to be look'd upon as &s;avages,
<PB N="85" REF="92">
as wild bea&s;ts of the de&s;art; and a &s;ingle and indepen|dent woman they hunt after as their proper prey.</P>
<P>To have done with Sir Hargrave for the pre&s;ent, and I wi&s;h I may be able to &s;ay, for ever; early in the morning, a billet was brought from him to Mr. Reeves, excu&s;ing him&s;elf from paying him a vi&s;it that morn|ing (as he had intended) by rea&s;on of the &s;udden and de&s;perate illne&s;s of a relation, who&s;e &s;eat was near Reading, with whom he had large concerns, and who was de&s;irous to &s;ee him before he died. As it was impo&s;&s;ible that he could return under three days, which, he &s;aid, would appear as three years to him, and he was obliged to &s;et out that moment; he could not di&s;pen&s;e with him&s;elf for putting in his <HI>claim,</HI> as he called it, to Mi&s;s Byron's favour, and confirming his declaration of ye&s;terday. In very high &s;trains, he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf her admirer; and begg'd Mr. and Mrs. Reeves's intere&s;t with her. One felicity, he &s;aid, he hoped for from his ab&s;ence, which was, that as Mi&s;s Byron, and Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, would have time to con&s;ider of his offers; he pre&s;um'd to hope he &s;hould not be &s;ubjected to a repul&s;e.</P>
<P>And now, my Lucy, you have before you as good an account as I can give you of my two new Lovers. How I &s;hall manage with them, I know not: But I begin to think that tho&s;e young women are happie&s;t, who&s;e friends take all the trouble of this &s;ort upon <HI>them;</HI> only con&s;ulting their daughters inclinations as preliminaries are adju&s;ting.</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> friends indeed pay an high compliment to my di&s;cretion, when they &s;o generou&s;ly allow me to judge for my&s;elf: And we young women are fond of be|ing our own mi&s;tre&s;&s;es: But I mu&s;t &s;ay, that to <HI>me</HI> this compliment has been, and is a painful one; for two rea&s;ons; That I cannot but con&s;ider their good|ne&s;s as a ta&s;k upon me, which requires my utmo&s;t cir|cum&s;pection, as well as gratitude; and that they have &s;hewn more genero&s;ity in di&s;pen&s;ing with their autho|rity,
<PB N="86" REF="93">
than I have done whenever I have acted &s;o as to appear, tho' <HI>but</HI> to appear, to accept of the di&s;pen&s;ati|on: Let me add be&s;ides, that now, when I find my|&s;elf likely to be addre&s;&s;ed to by mere &s;trangers, by men who grew not into my knowlege in&s;en&s;ibly, as our neighbours Greville, Fenwick, and Orme, did, I cannot but think it has the appearance of confidence, to &s;tand out to receive, as a creature uncontroulable, the fir&s;t motions to an addre&s;s of this awful nature. Awful indeed might it be called, were one's heart to incline towards a particular per&s;on.</P>
<P>Allow me then for the future, my revered grand|mamma, and you, my beloved and equally honoured uncle and aunt Selby, allow me, to refer my&s;elf to you, if any per&s;on offers to whom I may happen to have no &s;trong objections. As to Mr. Fowler, and the Baronet, I mu&s;t <HI>now</HI> do as well as I can with them. It is much ea&s;ier for a young woman to &s;ay <HI>No,</HI> than <HI>Yes.</HI> But for the time to come I will not have the a&s;&s;urance to act for my&s;elf. I know your partiality for your Harriet, too well, to doubt the merit of your recommendation.</P>
<P>As Mr. and Mrs. Reeves require me to &s;hew them what I write, they are fond of indulging me in the employment. You will therefore be the le&s;s &s;urpris'd that I write &s;o much in &s;o little a time. <HI>Mi&s;s Byron is in her Clo&s;et; Mi&s;s Byron is writing;</HI> is an excu&s;e &s;ufficient, they &s;eem to think, to every-body, becau&s;e they allow it to be one to them: But be&s;ides, I know they believe they oblige you all by the opportunity they &s;o kindly give me of &s;hewing my Duty and Love, where &s;o ju&s;tly due.</P>
<P>I am, however, &s;urpris'd at ca&s;ting my eye back.&mdash;Two &s;heets! and &s;uch a quantity before! Uncon|&s;cionable, &s;ay; and let me, Echo-like, repeat, Un|con&s;cionable</P>

As long as I can con|tribute to his amu&s;ement; as long as I know that he rather &s;ometimes delights to &s;ay what <HI>may be</HI> &s;aid, than what he really thinks; as long as I have my good aunt Selby for my advocate; as long as my grand|mamma is plea&s;ed and diverted with what I write; as well as with his plea&s;antries on her girl; and as long as you, my Lucy, &s;tand up for your Harriet; I will proceed; and when my mea&s;ure is full, and runs over, in his opinion, then let him a&s;cribe vanity and what he plea&s;es to me. I am but a woman: And he knows that I mu&s;t love him the better for his &s;tripes. Only let him take care, that, when he lays at my door faults of which I think I can acquit my|&s;elf, he increa&s;es not in me the vanity he is &s;o ready to attribute to me.</P>
<P>Well, but will you not, my Harriet, methinks you a&s;k, write with le&s;s openne&s;s, with more re&s;erve, in apprehen&s;ion of the rod which you know hangs over your head?</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="95">
Indeed I will not. It is my glory, that I have not a thought in my heart which I would conceal from any one whom it imported to know it, and who would be gratified by the revealing of it. And yet I am a little chagrin'd at the wager which you tell me my uncle has actually laid with my grandmamma, that I &s;hall not return from London with a &s;ound heart.</P>
<P>And does he teaze <HI>you,</HI> my Lucy, on this &s;ubject, with reminding you of your <HI>young</HI> partiality for Cap|tain Duncan, in order to make good his a&s;&s;ertion of the &s;u&s;ceptibility of us all!</P>
<P>Why &s;o let him. And why &s;hould you deny, that you <HI>were</HI> &s;u&s;ceptible of a natural pa&s;&s;ion? You mu&s;t not be prudi&s;h, Lucy. If you are <HI>not,</HI> all his raillery will lo&s;e its force. What better a&s;&s;urance can I give to my uncle, and to all my friends, that if I were caught, I would own it, than by advi&s;ing <HI>you</HI> not to be a&s;hamed to confe&s;s a &s;en&s;ibility which is no di&s;grace, when duty and prudence are our guides, and the ob|ject worthy?</P>
<P>Your man indeed was <HI>not</HI> worthy, as it proved; but he was a very &s;pecious creature; and you knew not his bad character, when you &s;uffered <HI>liking</HI> to grow into <HI>love.</HI> But when the Love-fever was at the height, did you make any-body unea&s;y with your pa&s;&s;ion? Did you run to woods and groves, to record it on the barks of trees?&mdash;No!&mdash;You &s;ighed in &s;ilence indeed: But it was but for a little while. I got your &s;ecret from you; not, however, till it betray'd it&s;elf in your pined countenance; and then the man's di&s;cover'd un|worthine&s;s, and your own di&s;cretion, enabled you to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion to which you had given way, &s;up|po&s;ing it unconquerable, becau&s;e you thought it would co&s;t you pains to contend with it.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, you know I have hitherto been on my guard. I have been careful ever to &s;hut the door of my heart again&s;t the blind deity, the moment I could
<PB N="89" REF="96">
imagine him &s;etting his incroaching foot on the <HI>thre&s;h|hold,</HI> which I think <HI>liking</HI> may be called. Had he once gained entrance, perhaps I might have come off but &s;imply.</P>
<P>But I hope I am in the le&s;s danger of falling in love with any man, as I can be civil and courteous to all. When a &s;tream is &s;luiced off into &s;everal channels, there is the le&s;s fear that it will overflow its banks. I really think I never &s;hall be in love with any-body, till duty directs inclination.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Lucy. I do now-and-then, you know, get into a boa&s;ting humour. But then my puni&s;h|ment, as in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, follows my fault: My uncle pulls me down, and &s;hews me, that I am not half &s;o good as the re&s;t of my friends think me.</P>
<P>You tell me, that Mr. Greville will be in London in a very few days. I can't help it. He pretends bu&s;ine&s;s, you &s;ay; and (&s;ince that calls him up) intends to give him&s;elf a month's plea&s;ure in town, and to take his &s;hare of the public entertainments. Well, &s;o let him. But I hope that I am not to be either his bu&s;ine&s;s or entertainment. After a civil neighbourly vi&s;it, or &s;o, I hope, I &s;hall not be tormented with him.</P>
<P>What happened once betwixt Mr. Fenwick and him, gave me pain enough; expo&s;ed me enough, &s;urely! A young woman, tho' without her own fault, made the occa&s;ion of a rencounter between two men of for|tune, mu&s;t be talked of too much for her own liking, or &s;he mu&s;t be a &s;trange creature. What numbers of people has the unhappy ra&s;hne&s;s of tho&s;e two men brought to &s;tare at me? And with what difficulty did my uncle and Mr. Deane bring them into &s;o odd a compromi&s;e, as they at la&s;t came into, to torment me by joint con&s;ent, notwith&s;tanding all I could &s;ay to them; which was the only probable way, &s;hocking creatures! to prevent murder?&mdash;And may I not be ap|prehen&s;ive of what may happen, &s;hould Sir Hargrave
<PB N="90" REF="97">
per&s;i&s;t in his pre&s;ent way of thinking?&mdash;Mr. Greville is a ra&s;h creature; and Sir John Alle&s;tree &s;ays, Sir Hargrave wants no re&s;olution.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Fenwick will come up, if the other does. But pray, my Lucy, let them know&mdash;Yet &s;hould you tell them that I am greatly aver&s;e to &s;eeing them, and that I will not &s;ee them if I can help it; that will be giving them con&s;equence in their own opinion; and as the one pleads bu&s;ine&s;s, it will be, in the inter|pretation of &s;o bold a man as Mr. Greville, making my&s;elf a part of it; and denying his vi&s;it before it is offered. They mu&s;t, in &s;hort, do as they will; if they are re&s;oved to haunt me at the public places to which I am to go, I am not &s;o fond of &s;hew and glit|ter, but I can forbear going often to them.</P>
<P>But to have done with the&s;e men&mdash;What an odd thing is it in my uncle, to take hold of what I &s;aid in one of my Letters, that I had a good mind to give you a &s;ketch of what I might &s;uppo&s;e the company at Lady Betty's would &s;ay of your Harriet, were each to write her character, to their confidents or corre|&s;pondents, as &s;he has done theirs to you!</P>
<P>I am apprehen&s;ive that his command on this occa|&s;ion is owing to his hope to find room from what I write, to charge me the heavier: But be this as it may, I will endeavour to obey him; and the more readily, as the ta&s;k will be an exerci&s;e to my fancy.&mdash;Which of you, my dear friends, was it, that once called me <HI>a fanciful girl?</HI></P>
<P>To begin&mdash;Lady Betty, who owns &s;he thinks fa|vourably of me, I will &s;uppo&s;e would write to her Lucy, in &s;uch terms as the&s;e: But &s;hall I &s;uppo&s;e every one to be &s;o happy, as to have her Lucy?</P>

<P>Mr. Walden (him&s;elf a Pa&s;quin) would thus per|haps have written to his Marforio:</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="100">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The fir&s;t Lady, whom, as the greate&s;t &s;tranger, I &s;hall take upon me to de&s;cribe, is Mi&s;s Harriet Byron of Northampton&s;hire. In her per&s;on &s;he is not di&s;agreeable; and mo&s;t people think her pretty. But, what is prettine&s;s? Why, neverthele&s;s, in a woman, prettine&s;s is&mdash;<HI>pretty:</HI> what other word can I &s;o fitly u&s;e of a per&s;on who, tho' a little <HI>&s;ightly,</HI> cannot be called a beauty? I will allow, that we men are not wrong in admiring <HI>mode&s;t</HI> women for the graces of their <HI>per&s;ons:</HI> But let them <HI>be</HI> mode&s;t; let them return the compliment, and revere <HI>Us</HI> for our capaciou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>mind:</HI> And &s;o they will, if they are brought up to know their own weakne&s;s, and that they are but dome&s;tic animals of a &s;uperior order. Even ignorance, let me tell you, my Mar|forio, is pretty in a woman. Humility is one of their principal graces. Women hardly ever &s;et them|&s;elves to acquire the knowlege that is proper to men, but they neglect for it, what more indi&s;pen&s;ably be|longs to women. To have them come to their hu&s;bands, to their brothers, and even to their lovers, when they have a mind to know any-thing out of their way, and beg to be in&s;tructed and informed, in&s;pireth them with the becoming humility which I have touched upon, and giveth us importance with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Indeed, my Marforio, there are very few topics that ari&s;e in conver&s;ation among men, upon which women ought to open their lips. Silence becomes them. Let them therefore hear, wonder, and im|prove, in &s;ilence.

vation. But there was another Lady pre&s;ent, Mi&s;s Clements, who (if there be any merit to a <HI>woman</HI> in it) appeareth to me to excel her in the compa&s;s of her reading; and that upon the &s;trength of her own diligence and abilities; for this Mi&s;s Harriet hath had &s;ome pains taken with her by her late grand|father, a man of erudition, who had his education among <HI>us.</HI> This old gentleman, I am told, took it into his head, having no grand&s;on, to give this girl a <HI>booki&s;h</HI> turn; but he wi&s;ely &s;topt at her mo|ther-tongue! only giving her a &s;mattering in French and Italian.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'As I &s;aw that the eyes of every one were upon her, I was willing to hear what &s;he had to &s;ay for her&s;elf. Poor girl!

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I therefore trifled a little with her.

You know, Marforio, that a man, when he is provok'd to fight with an over|grown boy, hath every-body again&s;t him: So hath a &s;cholar who engageth on learned topics with a woman. The Sex mu&s;t be flatter'd at the expence of truth. Many things are thought to be pretty from the mouth of a woman, which would be egregiou&s;ly weak and &s;illy proceeding from that of a man. His very eminence in learning, on &s;uch a contention, would tend only to exalt her, and de|preciate him&s;elf. As the girl was every-body's favourite, and as the Baronet &s;eemed to eye her with particular regard, I &s;pared her. A man would not, you know, &s;poil a girl's fortune.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="102">
But how &s;hall I be able to tell you what I imagine Sir Hargrave would have written? Can I do it, if I place him in the light of a Lover, and not either un|der-do his character as &s;uch, or incur the cen&s;ure of vanity and conceit?</P>
<P>Well, but are you &s;ure, Harriet, methinks my uncle a&s;ks, that the Baronet is really and truly &s;o egre|giou&s;ly &s;mitten with you, as he pretended he was?</P>
<P>Why, ay! That's the thing, Sir!</P>
<P>You girls are &s;o apt to take in earne&s;t the compli|ments made you by men!</P>
<P>And &s;o we are. But our credulity, my dear Sir, is a greater proof of <HI>our</HI> innocence, than mens profe&s;&s;ions are of <HI>their</HI> &s;incerity. So, let lo&s;ers &s;peak, and win|ners laugh.</P>
<P>But let him be in je&s;t, if he will. In je&s;t or in earne&s;t, Sir Hargrave mu&s;t be extravagant, I ween, in love-&s;peeches. And that I may not be thought wholly to decline this part of my ta&s;k, I will &s;uppo&s;e him profe&s;&s;ing with Hudibras, after he has prai&s;ed me beyond mea&s;ure, for graces of his own creation;</P>

<P>Writing, Mi&s;s Byron, all day! &s;aid Mrs. Reeves. We have greatly mi&s;&s;ed you.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in &s;eemed to &s;ay this, on purpo&s;e to give me time to recover my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="106">
I have blotted &s;everal &s;heets of paper, &s;aid I, and had ju&s;t concluded.</P>
<P>I hope, madam, &s;aid the knight, leaning forward his whole body, and peering in my face under his bent brows, that <HI>we</HI> have not been the cau&s;e of ha&s;ten|ing you down.</P>
<P>I &s;tared. But as he &s;eemed not to mean any-thing, I would not help him to a meaning by my own over|quickne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler had done an extraordinary thing, and &s;at down, hemmed, and &s;aid nothing; looking, how|ever, as if he was at a lo&s;s to know whether he or his uncle was expected to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The cold weather was then the &s;ubject; and the two gentlemen rubbed their hands, and drew nearer the fire, as if they were the colder for talking of it. Many hems pa&s;&s;ed between them, now the uncle look|ing on the nephew, now the nephew on the uncle: At la&s;t they fell into talk of their new-built hou&s;e at Caermarthen; and the furni&s;hing of it.</P>
<P>They mentioned afterwards their very genteel neighbourhood, and gave the characters of half a dozen people, of whom none pre&s;ent but them&s;elves ever heard; but all tending to &s;hew how much they were valued by the be&s;t gentry in Caermarthen&s;hire.</P>
<P>The knight then related a conver&s;ation that had once pa&s;&s;ed between him&s;elf and the late Lord Man&s;ell, in which that nobleman had complimented him on an e&s;tate of a clear 3000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, be&s;ides a good deal of ready ca&s;h, and with &s;uppo&s;ing that he would &s;et up his nephew when at age (for it was &s;ome years ago) as a repre&s;entative for the county. And he repeated the <HI>prudent</HI> an&s;wer he gave his Lord&s;hip, di&s;avowing &s;uch a de&s;ign, as no better than a gaming <HI>propen&s;ity,</HI> as he called it, which had ruined many a fair e&s;tate.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of talk, in which his nephew <HI>could</HI> bear a part (and indeed they had it all between them) held the tea-time; and then having given them&s;elves the
<PB N="100" REF="107">
con&s;equence they had &s;eemed to intend, the knight, drawing his chair nearer me, and winking to his ne|phew, who withdrew, began to &s;et forth the young gentleman's good qualities; to declare the pa&s;&s;ion he had for me; and to beg my encouragement of &s;o worthy, &s;o <HI>proper,</HI> and &s;o <HI>well-favoured</HI> a young man; who was to be his &s;ole heir; and for whom he would do &s;uch things, on my account, as, during his life, he would not do for any other woman <HI>breathing.</HI></P>
<P>There was no an&s;wering a di&s;cour&s;e &s;o &s;erious with the air of levity, which it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to avoid a&s;&s;uming, on the fir&s;t vi&s;it of the knight.</P>
<P>I was vexed that I found my&s;elf almo&s;t as ba&s;hful, as &s;illy, and as &s;ilent, as if I had thoughts of encourage|ing Mr. Fowler's addre&s;&s;es. My cou&s;ins &s;eemed plea&s;ed with my ba&s;hfulne&s;s. The knight, I once thought, by the tone of his voice and his hum, would have &s;truck up a Wel&s;h tune, and danced for joy.</P>
<P>Shall I call in my kin&s;man, madam, to confirm all I have &s;aid, and to pour out the whole &s;oul at your feet? My boy is ba&s;hful: But a little favour from that &s;weet countenance will make a man of him. Let me, let me, call in my boy. I will go for him my&s;elf; and was going.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ay one word, Sir Rowland&mdash;before Mr. Fowler comes in&mdash;before you &s;peak to him&mdash;You have explained your&s;elf unexceptionably. I am oblig|ed to you and Mr. Fowler for your good opinion: But this can never be.</P>
<P>How, madam! can <HI>never</HI> be!&mdash;I will allow that you &s;hall take time for half a dozen vi&s;its, or &s;o, that you may be able to judge of my nephew's qualities and under&s;tanding, and be convinced from his own mouth, and heart and &s;oul, as I may &s;ay, of his Love for you. No need of time for <HI>him.</HI> He, poor man! is fixed; immoveably fixed: But &s;ay you will take a week's time, or &s;o, to con&s;ider what you <HI>can</HI> do, what you <HI>will</HI> do&mdash;And that's all I at pre&s;ent crave, or indeed, madam, can <HI>allow</HI> you.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="108">
I cannot doubt <HI>now,</HI> Sir Rowland, of what my mind will be a week hence, as to this matter.</P>
<P>How, madam!&mdash;Why we are all in the <HI>&s;uds</HI> then!&mdash;Why, Mr. Reeves, Mrs. Reeves!&mdash;Whew! with an half-whi&s;tle&mdash;Why, madam, we &s;hall, at this rate, be all <HI>untwi&s;ted!</HI>&mdash;But (after a pau&s;e) by Mercy I will not be thus an&s;wered!&mdash;Why, madam, would you have the con&s;cience to break my poor boy's heart?&mdash;Come, be as gracious as you look to be&mdash;Give me your hand&mdash;[He &s;natched my hand. In re&s;pect to his years I withdrew it not] And give my boy your heart.&mdash;Sweet &s;oul! Such &s;en&s;ible, &s;uch good-natured man|tlings!&mdash;Why you can't be cruel, if you would!&mdash;Dear Lady! Say you will take a little time to con&s;i|der of this matter. Don't repeat tho&s;e cruel words, "It can never be."&mdash;What have you to object to my boy?</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler, both by character and appearance, Sir Rowland, is a worthy man. He is a mode&s;t man; and mode&s;ty&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, and &s;o he is&mdash;Mercy! I was afraid that his mode&s;ty would be an objection&mdash;</P>
<P>It cannot, Sir Rowland, with a mode&s;t woman. I love, I revere, a mode&s;t man: But, indeed, I cannot <HI>give</HI> hope, where I mean not to <HI>encourage</HI> any.</P>
<P>Your objection, madam, to my nephew&mdash;You mu&s;t have &s;een &s;omething in him you di&s;like.</P>
<P>I do not ea&s;ily <HI>di&s;-like,</HI> Sir; but then I do not ea|&s;ily <HI>like.</HI> And I never will marry any man, to whom I cannot be more than indifferent.</P>
<P>Why, madam, he adores you&mdash;He&mdash;</P>
<P>That, Sir, is an objection, unle&s;s I could return his Love. My gratitude would be endangered.</P>
<P>Excellent notions!&mdash;With the&s;e notions, madam, you could not be ungrateful.</P>
<P>That, Sir, is a ri&s;que I will never run. How many bad wives are there, who would have been good ones, had they not married either to their di&s;like, or with
<PB N="102" REF="109">
indifference? Good beginnings, Sir Rowland, are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to good progre&s;&s;es, and to happy conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Why &s;o they are. But beginnings that are <HI>not</HI> bad, with good people, will make no <HI>bad</HI> progre&s;&s;es, no <HI>bad</HI> conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>No bad</HI> is not <HI>good,</HI> Sir Rowland; and in &s;uch a world as this, &s;hall people lay them&s;elves open to the danger of acting contrary to their duty? Shall they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be bribed, either by convenien|cies, or &s;uperfluities, to give their hands, and leave their hearts doubtful or indifferent? It would not be hone&s;t to do &s;o.</P>
<P>You told me, madam, the fir&s;t time I had the ho|nour to &s;ee you, that you were ab&s;olutely and <HI>bon&acirc;+fide</HI> di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>I told you truth, Sir.</P>
<P>Then, madam, we will <HI>not</HI> take your denial. We will per&s;evere. We will <HI>not</HI> be di&s;couraged. What a <HI>duce!</HI> Have I not heard it &s;aid, that <HI>faint heart ne|ver won fair Lady?</HI></P>
<P>I never would give an ab&s;olute denial, Sir, were I to have the lea&s;t doubt of my mind. If I could ba|lance, I would con&s;ult my friends, and refer to them; and their opinion &s;hould have due weight with me. But for your <HI>nephew</HI>'s &s;ake, Sir Rowland, while his e&s;teem for me is young and conquerable, urge not this matter farther. I would not give pain to a wor|thy heart.</P>
<P>As I hope for mercy, madam, &s;o well do I like your notions, that if you will be my niece, and let me but conver&s;e with you once a day, I will be contented with an hundred pounds a year, and &s;ettle upon you all I have in the world.</P>
<P>His eyes gli&s;tened; his face glowed; an hone&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s appeared in his countenance.</P>
<P>Generous man! good Sir Rowland! &s;aid I. I was affected. I was forced to withdraw.</P>
<P>I &s;oon returned, and found Sir Rowland, his hand|kerchief
<PB N="103" REF="110">
in his hand, applying very earne&s;tly to my cou&s;ins. And they were &s;o much affected, too, that on his re&s;uming the &s;ubject to me, they could not help putting in a word or two on his &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">de of the que|&s;tion.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland then propo&s;ed to call in his nephew, that he might &s;peak for him&s;elf. My boy may be over-awed by Love, madam: True Love is always fearful: Yet he is no milk&s;op, I do a&s;&s;ure you. To <HI>men</HI> he has courage. How he will behave to <HI>you,</HI> madam, I know not; for really, notwith&s;tanding that &s;weetne&s;s of a&s;pect, which I &s;hould have thought would have led one to &s;ay what one would to you (in mode&s;ty I mean) I have a kind of I cannot-tell-what for you my&s;elf. Reverence it is not, neither, I think.&mdash;I only reverence my Maker&mdash;And yet I believe it is. Why, madam, your face is one of God Almighty's wonders in a little compa&s;s&mdash;Pardon me&mdash;You may blu&s;h&mdash;But <HI>be</HI> gracious now!&mdash;Don't &s;hew us, that, with a face &s;o encouragingly tender, you have an hard heart.</P>
<P>O Sir Rowland, you are an excellent advocate: But pray tell Mr. Fowler&mdash;</P>
<P>I will call him in&mdash;And was ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>No, don't. But tell Mr. Fowler that I regard him, on a double account; for his own worth's &s;ake, and for his uncle's: But &s;ubject me not, I once more entreat you, to the pain of repul&s;ing a worthy man. I repeat, that I am under obligation to him for the value he has for me: I &s;hall be under more, if he will accept of my thanks as all I have to return.</P>
<P>My dear Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid Mr. Reeves, oblige Sir Rowland &s;o far, as to take a little time to con&s;ider&mdash;</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you on earth and in heaven, Mr. Reeves, for this! You are a good man&mdash;Why, ay, take a lit|tle time to con&s;ider&mdash;God ble&s;s you, madam, take a little time. Say you will con&s;ider. You know not what a man of under&s;tanding my nephew is. Why,
<PB N="104" REF="111">
madam, mode&s;t as he is, and awed by his Love for you, he cannot &s;hew half the good &s;en&s;e he is ma|&s;ter of.</P>
<P>Mode&s;t men mu&s;t have merit, Sir. But how <HI>can</HI> you, Mr. Reeves, make a difficult ta&s;k more difficult? And yet all is from the goodne&s;s of your heart. You &s;ee Sir Rowland thinks me cruel: I have no cruelty in my nature. I love to oblige. I wi&s;h to match <HI>you</HI> in genero&s;ity, Sir Rowland&mdash;A&s;k me for any-thing but <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> and I will endeavour to oblige you.</P>
<P>Admirable, by mercy! Why, every-thing you &s;ay, in&s;tead of making me de&s;i&s;t, induces me to per&s;evere. There is no yielding up &s;uch a prize, if one can obtain it. Tell me, Mr. Reeves, where there is &s;uch another woman to be had, and we may give up Mi&s;s Byron: But I hope &s;he will con&s;ider of it.&mdash;Pray, madam&mdash;But I will call in my nephew. And out he went in ha&s;te, as if he were afraid of being again forbidden.</P>
<P>Mean time my cou&s;ins put it to me&mdash;But before I could an&s;wer them, the knight, followed by his ne|phew, returned.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler entered, bowing in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner. He looked much more dejected than when he approached me at my fir&s;t coming down. His uncle had given him an hint of what had pa&s;&s;ed between us.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler and I had but ju&s;t &s;at down, when the knight &s;aid to Mr. Revees (but took him not by the button, as in his fir&s;t vi&s;it) One word with you, Sir&mdash;Mr. Reeves, one word with you, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>They withdrew together; and pre&s;ently after Mrs. Reeves went out at the other door; and I was left alone with Mr. Fowler.</P>
<P>We both &s;at &s;ilent for about three or four minutes. I thought I ought not to begin; Mr. Fowler knew not how. He drew his chair nearer to me; then &s;at a little farther off; then drew it nearer again; &s;troked his ruffles, and hemmed two or three times; and, at la&s;t, You cannot, madam, but ob&s;erve my confu&s;ion; my
<PB N="105" REF="112">
concern, my, my, my confu&s;ion!&mdash;It is all owing to my reverence, my re&s;pect, my <HI>reverence,</HI> for you&mdash;hem!&mdash;He gave two gentle hems, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>I could not enjoy the mode&s;t man's aukwardne&s;s.&mdash;Every feature of his face working, his hands and his knees trembling, and his tongue faltering, how bar|barous had I been, if I could!&mdash;O Lucy, what a di&s;|qualifier is Love, if &s;uch agitations as the&s;e are na|tural effects of <HI>that</HI> pa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>Sir Rowland has been acquainting me, Sir, &s;aid I, with the good opinion you have of me. I am very much obliged to you for it. I have been telling Sir Rowland&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah, madam! Say not what you have been telling Sir Rowland: He has hinted it to me. I mu&s;t indeed confe&s;s my unworthine&s;s; yet I cannot forbear a&s;pire|ing to your favour. Who that knows what will make him the happie&s;t of men, however unworthy he may be, can forbear &s;eeking his happine&s;s? I can only &s;ay, I am the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men, if&mdash;</P>
<P>Good Mr. Fowler, interrupted I, indulge not an hope that cannot be an&s;wered. I will not pretend to &s;ay, that I &s;hould not merit your e&s;teem, if I could return it; becau&s;e, to whom&s;oever I &s;hould give my hand, I would make it a point of duty to de&s;erve his affection: But, for that very rea&s;on, and that I may have not temptation to do otherwi&s;e, I mu&s;t be con|vinced in my own mind, that there is not a man in the world whom I could value more than him I cho&s;e.</P>
<P>He &s;ighed. I was <HI>a&s;&s;ured,</HI> madam, &s;aid he, that your heart was ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged: On that a&s;&s;ur|ance I founded my pre&s;umptuous hope.</P>
<P>And &s;o it is, Mr. Fowler. I have never yet &s;een a man whom I could wi&s;h to marry.</P>
<P>Then, madam, may I not hope, that time, that my a&s;&s;iduities, that my profound reverence, my un|bounded Love&mdash;</P>
<P>O Mr. Fowler, think me not either in&s;en&s;ible or
<PB N="106" REF="113">
ungrateful: But time, I am &s;ure can make no alter|ation in this ca&s;e. I can only e&s;teem <HI>you,</HI> and that from a motive which I think has &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in it, be|cau&s;e you have &s;hewn a regard for <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in this motive; madam, it is amiable gratitude: And if all the &s;ervices of my life, if all the adoration&mdash;</P>
<P>I have a very indifferent notion of &s;udden impre&s;|&s;ions, Mr. Fowler: But I will not que&s;tion the &s;ince|rity of a man I think &s;o worthy. Sir Rowland has been very urgent with me: He has wi&s;hed me to take time to con&s;ider. I have told him I <HI>would,</HI> if I could doubt: But that I cannot. For <HI>your own</HI> &s;ake, there|fore, let me entreat you to place your affections el&s;e|where. And may you place them happily!</P>
<P>You have, madam, I am afraid, &s;een men whom you could prefer to me&mdash;</P>
<P>Our acquaintance, Mr. Fowler, is very &s;hort. It would be no wonder if I had. Yet I told you truly, that I never yet &s;aw a man whom I could wi&s;h to marry.</P>
<P>He looked down, and &s;ighed.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Fowler, to be &s;till more frank and explicit with you, as I think you a very worthy man; I will own, that were any of the gentlemen I have hitherto known, to be my lot, it mu&s;t be, I think, in com|pa&s;&s;ion (in <HI>gratitude</HI> I had almo&s;t &s;aid) one (who neverthele&s;s it cannot be) who has profe&s;&s;ed a love for me ever &s;ince I was a child. A man of honour, of virtue, of mode&s;ty; &s;uch a man as I believe Mr. Fow|ler is. His fortune indeed is not &s;o con&s;iderable as Sir Rowland &s;ays yours will be: But, Sir, as there is no other rea&s;on on the compari&s;on, why I &s;hould prefer Mr. Fowler to him, I &s;hould think the wor&s;e of my|&s;elf as long as I lived, if I gave a preference over &s;uch a tried affection to fortune only. And now, Sir, I expect that you will make a generous u&s;e of my frank|ne&s;s, le&s;t the gentleman, if you &s;hould know him,
<PB N="107" REF="114">
may hear of it. And this I reque&s;t for <HI>his &s;ake,</HI> as I think I can never be his; as for <HI>yours</HI> I have been thus explicit.</P>
<P>I can only &s;ay, that I am the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men!&mdash;But will you, madam, give me leave to vi&s;it Mr. Reeves now-and-then?</P>
<P>Not on my account Mr. Fowler. Under&s;tand it &s;o; and if you &s;ee me, let it be with indifference, and without expectation from me; and I &s;hall always be|have my&s;elf to you, as to a man who has obliged me by his good opinion.</P>
<P>He bowed: Sat in &s;ilence: Pulled out his hand|kerchief.&mdash;I pitied him.</P>
<P>But let me a&s;k all you, my friends, who Love Mr. Orme, Was I wrong? I think I never could Love Mr. Fowler, as a wife ought to love her hu&s;band.&mdash;May he meet with a worthy woman who can! And &s;urely &s;o good, &s;o mode&s;t a man, and of &s;uch an ample for|tune, ea&s;ily&punc; may: While it may be my lot, if ever I marry, to be the wife of a man, with whom I may not be &s;o happy, as either Mr. Orme or Mr. Fowler would probably make me; could I prevail upon my|&s;elf to be the wife of either. O my uncle, often do I reflect on your mercer's &s;hop.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler aro&s;e, and walked di&s;con&s;olately about the room, and often profoundly, and, I believe <HI>(not</HI> Greville-like) &s;incerely &s;ighed. His motion &s;oon brought in the knight and Mr. Reeves at one door, and Mrs. Reeves at the other.</P>
<P>Well! What news? What news?&mdash;Good, I hope, &s;aid the knight, with &s;pread hands&mdash;Ah my poor boy! Thus alamort! Surely, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>There he &s;topt, and looked wi&s;tfully at me; then at my cou&s;ins&mdash;Mr. Reeves, Mrs. Reeves, &s;peak a good word for my boy. The heart that belongs to that countenance cannot be adamant &s;urely.&mdash;Dear young Lady, let your power be equalled by your mercy.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler, Sir Rowland, has too much genero&s;ity
<PB N="108" REF="115">
to upbraid me, I dare &s;ay. Nor will you think me either perver&s;e or ungenerous, when he tells you what has pa&s;&s;ed between us.</P>
<P>Have you given him hope, then? God grant it, tho' but di&s;tant hope! Have you &s;aid you will con&s;i|der&mdash;Dear ble&s;&s;ed Lady!&mdash;</P>
<P>O Sir, interrupted I, how good you are to your nephew! How worthily is your Love placed on him! What a proof is it of <HI>his</HI> merit, and of the goodne&s;s of <HI>your</HI> heart!&mdash;I &s;hall always have an e&s;teem for you both!&mdash;Your excu&s;e, Sir Rowland: Yours, Mr. Fowler. Be &s;o good as to allow me to withdraw.</P>
<P>I retired to my own apartment, and throwing my|&s;elf into a chair, reflected on what had pa&s;&s;ed; and after a while recollected my&s;elf to begin to write it down for you.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had withdrawn, Mr. Fowler, with a &s;orrowful heart, as my cou&s;ins told me, related all that I had &s;aid to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves was &s;o good as to prai&s;e me for what he called my genero&s;ity to Mr. Orme, as well as for my frankne&s;s and civility to Mr. Fowler.</P>
<P>That was the duce of it, Sir Rowland &s;aid, that were they to have no remedy, they could not find any fault in me to comfort them&s;elves with.</P>
<P>They put it over and over to my cou&s;in, Whether time and a&s;&s;iduity might not prevail with me to change my mind? And whether an application to my friends in the country might not, on &s;etting-every thing fairly before them, be of &s;ervice? But Mr. Reeves told them, that now I had opened &s;o freely my mind, and had &s;poken &s;o unexpectedly, yet &s;o gratefully, in favour of Mr. Orme, he feared there could be no hopes.</P>
<P>However, both gentlemen, at taking leave recom|mended them&s;elves to Mr. and Mrs. Reeves for their intere&s;ts; and the knight vowed that I &s;hould not come off &s;o ea&s;ily.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="116">
So much, and adieu, my Lucy, for the addre&s;&s;es of worthy Mr. Fowler. Pray, however, for your Har|riet, that &s;he may not draw a wor&s;e lot.</P>

<P>AT a private concert la&s;t night with my cou&s;ins and Mi&s;s Clements; and again to be at the play this night; I &s;hall be a racketer, I doubt.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler called here this morning. Mrs. Reeves and I were out on a vi&s;it. But Mr. Reeves was at home, and they had a good deal of di&s;cour&s;e about me. The worthy man &s;poke &s;o de&s;pairingly of his &s;ucce&s;s with me, that I hope, for his own &s;ake, I &s;hall hear no more of his addre&s;&s;es; and with the more rea&s;on, as Sir Rowland will in a few days &s;et out for Caermarthen.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland called afterwards: But Mr. Reeves was abroad; and Mrs. Reeves and I were gone to Ludgate-hill, to buy a gown, which is to be made up in all ha&s;te, that I may the more fa&s;hionably at|tend Lady Betty Williams to &s;ome of the public en|tertainments. I have been very extravagant: But it is partly my cou&s;in's fault. I &s;end you inclo&s;ed a pattern of my &s;ilk. I thought we were high in the fa&s;hion in Northampton&s;hire; but all my cloaths are altering, that I may not <HI>look frightful,</HI> as the phra&s;e is.</P>
<P>But &s;hall I as ea&s;ily get rid of the Baronet, think you, as I hope I have of Mr. Fowler? He is come to town, and by his own invention (in a card to Mr. Reeves) is to be here to-morrow afternoon. What &s;ignifies my getting out of the way? He will &s;ee me at another time; and I &s;hall increa&s;e my own difficulties, and his con&s;equence, if he thinks I am afraid of him.</P>

<P>SIR Hargrave came before &s;ix o'clock. He was richly dre&s;&s;ed. He a&s;ked for Mr. Reeves. I was in my clo&s;et, writing. He was not likely to be the better received for the character Sir John Alle&s;tree gave of him.</P>
<P>He excu&s;ed him&s;elf for coming &s;o early, on the &s;core of his impatience, and that he might have a lit|tle di&s;cour&s;e with them, if I &s;hould be engaged be|fore tea-time.</P>
<P>Was I within?&mdash;I was.&mdash;Thank heaven!&mdash;I was very good.</P>
<P>So he &s;eemed to imagine that I was at home, in compliment to him.</P>
<P>Shall I give you, from my cou&s;ins, an account of the conver&s;ation before I went down? You know Mrs. Reeves is a nice ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>He had had, he told my cou&s;ins, a mo&s;t unea&s;y time of it, ever &s;ince he &s;aw me. The devil fetch him, if he had had one hour's re&s;t! He never &s;aw a woman before, whom he could love as he loved me. By his &s;oul, he had no view, but what was &s;trictly honourable.</P>
<P>He &s;ometimes &s;at down, &s;ometimes walked about the room, &s;trutting, and now-and-then adju&s;ting &s;ome|thing in his dre&s;s that nobody el&s;e &s;aw wanted it. He gloried in the happy pro&s;pects before him: Not but he knew I had a little <HI>army</HI> of admirers: But as none of them had met with encouragement from me, he hoped there was room for him to flatter him&s;elf that <HI>he</HI> might be the happy man.</P>
<P>I told you, Mr. Reeves, &s;aid he, that I will give you <HI>carte blanche</HI> as to &s;ettlements. What I do for
<PB N="111" REF="118">
&s;o prudent a woman, will be doing for my&s;elf. I am not u&s;ed, Mr. Reeves, to boa&s;t of my <HI>fortune</HI> [Then, it &s;eems, he went up to the gla&s;s, as if his <HI>per&s;on</HI> could not fail of being an <HI>additional</HI> recommendation] but I will lay before you, or before any of Mi&s;s Byron's friends (Mr. Deane, if &s;he plea&s;es&mdash;) my rent-rolls. There never was a better-conditioned e&s;tate. She &s;hall live in town, or in the country, as &s;he thinks fit; and in the latter, at which of my &s;eats &s;he plea&s;es. I know I &s;hall have no will but hers. I doubt not <HI>your</HI> friend&s;hip, Mr. Reeves. I hope for <HI>yours,</HI> madam. I &s;hall have great plea&s;ure in the al|liance I have in view, with every individual of your family&mdash;As if he would &s;atisfy them of his friend|&s;hip, in the near relation, as the only matter that could bear a doubt.</P>
<P>Then he ran on upon the part I bore in the conver|&s;ation at Lady Betty Williams's&mdash;By his &s;oul, <HI>only</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t, the wittie&s;t, the mo&s;t gracefully mode&s;t of women&mdash;<HI>that was all</HI>&mdash;Then Ha, ha, ha, hah, poor Walden! What a &s;illy fellow! He had <HI>caught a Tar|tar!</HI>&mdash;Ha, ha, ha, hah&mdash;Shaking his head and his gay &s;ides: Devil take him if ever he &s;aw a <HI>Prig</HI> &s;o fairly taken in!&mdash;But I was a &s;ly little rogue!&mdash;He &s;aw that!&mdash;By all that's good, I mu&s;t my&s;elf <HI>&s;ing &s;mall</HI> in <HI>her</HI> company!&mdash;I will never meet at hard-edge with her&mdash;If I did&mdash;(and yet I have been thought to carry a good one) I &s;hould be confoundedly gapped, <HI>I can &s;ee that</HI> [alluding to two knives, I &s;uppo&s;e, gapping each other; and winking with one eye; and, as Mrs. Reeves de&s;cribed him, looking as wi&s;e as if he would make a compliment to his <HI>penetration,</HI> at the expence of his <HI>under&s;tanding]:</HI> But, continued he, as a woman is more an hu&s;band's than a man is a wife's [Have all the men this prerogative-notion, Lucy? You know it is a better man's] I &s;hall have a pride worth boa&s;ting of, if I can call &s;uch a jewel mine. Poor Walden!&mdash;Rot the fellow!&mdash;I warrant he would not have &s;o
<PB N="112" REF="119">
knowing a wife for the world.&mdash;Ha, ha, ha, hah! He is right: It is certainly right for &s;uch narrow pedants to be afraid of learned women!&mdash;Methinks, I &s;ee the fellow, conjurer-like, circum&s;cribed in a narrow circle, putting into Greek what was better expre&s;&s;ed in Engli&s;h; and forbidding every one's approach within the di&s;tance of his wand!&mdash;Hah, hah, hah!&mdash;Let me die, if ever I &s;aw a tragi-comical fellow better handled!&mdash;Then the faces he made&mdash;Saw you ever, Mr. Reeves, &s;aw you ever in your life &s;uch a parcel of di&s;a&s;trous faces made by one man?</P>
<P>Thus did Sir Hargrave, laughingly, run on: Nor left he hardly any-thing for my cou&s;ins to &s;ay, or to do, but to laugh <HI>with</HI> him, and to &s;mile <HI>at</HI> him.</P>
<P>On a me&s;&s;age that tea was near ready, I went down. On my entering the room, he addre&s;&s;ed me with an air of kindne&s;s and freedom: Charming Mi&s;s Byron! &s;aid he, I hope you are all benignity and compa&s;&s;ion. You know not what I have &s;uffered &s;ince I had the honour to &s;ee you la&s;t; bowing very low; then rear|ing him&s;elf up, holding back his head; and &s;eemed the taller for having bowed.</P>
<P>Hand&s;ome fop! thought I to my&s;elf. I took my &s;eat; and endeavoured to look ea&s;y and free, as u&s;ual; finding &s;omething to &s;ay to my cou&s;ins, and to him. He begged that tea might be po&s;tponed for half an hour; and that, before the &s;ervants were admitted, I would hear him relate the &s;ub&s;tance of the conver&s;a|tion that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mr. and Mrs. Reeves.</P>
<P>Had not Sir Hargrave intended me an honour, and had he not a very high opinion of the efficacy of eight thou&s;and pounds a year in an addre&s;s of this kind, I dare &s;ay, he would have &s;uppo&s;ed a little more pre|facing nece&s;&s;ary: But, after he had told me, in few words, how much he was attracted by my character before he &s;aw me, he thought fit directly to refer him|&s;elf to the declaration he had made at Lady Betty Wil|liams's,
<PB N="113" REF="120">
both to Mr. Reeves and my&s;elf; and then talked of large &s;ettlements; boa&s;ted of his violent pa&s;&s;ion; and be&s;ought my favour with the utmo&s;t ear|ne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>I would have played a little female trifling upon him, and affected to take his profe&s;&s;ions only for polite raillery, which men call <HI>making love</HI> to young women, who perhaps are frequently but too willing to take in earne&s;t what the wretches mean but in je&s;t; but the fervour with which he <HI>renewed</HI> (as he called it) his declaration, admitted not of &s;ooling; and yet his <HI>vo|lubility</HI> might have made que&s;tionable the &s;incerity of his declarations. As therefore I could not think of encouraging his addre&s;&s;es, I thought it be&s;t to an&s;wer him with openne&s;s and unre&s;erve.</P>
<P>To &s;eem to que&s;tion the &s;incerity of &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions as you make, Sir Hargrave, might appear to you as if I wanted to be a&s;&s;ured: But be plea&s;ed to know that you are directing your di&s;cour&s;e to one of the plaine&s;t|hearted women in England; and you may therefore expect from me nothing but the &s;imple&s;t truth. I thank you, Sir, for your good opinion of me; but I cannot encourage your addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>You <HI>cannot,</HI> madam, <HI>encourage my addre&s;&s;es!</HI> And expre&s;s your&s;elf &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly! Good heaven! [He &s;tood &s;ilent a minute or two, looking upon me, and upon him&s;elf; as if he had &s;aid, fooli&s;h girl! knows &s;he whom &s;he refu&s;es?] I have been a&s;&s;ured, madam, re|covering a little from his &s;urprize, that your affections are not engaged. But &s;urely it mu&s;t be a mi&s;take; Some happy man&mdash;</P>
<P>Is it, interrupted I, a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that the woman who cannot receive the addre&s;&s;es of Sir Hargrave Pollex&s;en, mu&s;t be engaged?</P>
<P>Why, madam&mdash;As to that&mdash;I know not what to &s;ay&mdash;But a man of my fortune, and I hope, not <HI>ab|&s;olutely</HI> di&s;agreeable either in per&s;on or temper; of <HI>&s;ome</HI> rank in life&mdash;He pau&s;ed; then re&s;uming&mdash;What,
<PB N="114" REF="121">
madam, if you are as much in earne&s;t as you &s;eem, can be your objection? Be &s;o good as to name it, that I may know, whether I cannot be &s;o happy as to get over it?</P>
<P>We do not, we <HI>cannot,</HI> all like the &s;ame per&s;on. Women, I have heard &s;ay are very capricious. Per|haps I am &s;o. But there is a <HI>&s;omething</HI> (we cannot always &s;ay what) that attracts or di&s;gu&s;ts us.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;gu&s;ts!</HI> madam&mdash;<HI>Di&s;gu&s;ts!</HI> Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>I &s;poke in general, Sir; I dare &s;ay, nineteen women out of twenty would think them&s;elves favoured in the addre&s;&s;es of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen.</P>
<P>But <HI>you,</HI> madam, are the twentieth that I mu&s;t love: And be &s;o good as to let me know&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, a&s;k me not a rea&s;on for a <HI>peculiarity.</HI> Do you not your&s;elf &s;hew a peculiarity in making me the twentieth?</P>
<P><HI>Your</HI> merit, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>It would be vanity in me, Sir, interrupted I, to allow a force to that plea. You, Sir, may have more merit, than perhaps the man I may happen to approve of better; but&mdash;<HI>&s;hall</HI> I &s;ay? (Pardon me, Sir) You do not&mdash;You do not, he&s;itated I&mdash;hit my fancy&mdash;Pardon me, Sir.</P>
<P>If pardon depends upon <HI>my</HI> breath, let me die if I <HI>do!&mdash;Not hit your fancy,</HI> madam! [And then he look'd upon him&s;elf all round] <HI>Not hit your fancy,</HI> madam!</P>
<P>I told you, Sir, that you mu&s;t not expect any-thing from me but the &s;imple&s;t truth. You do me an honour in your good opinion; and if my own heart were not, in this ca&s;e, a very determined one, I would an&s;wer you with more politene&s;s. But, Sir, on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion as this, I think it would not be honourable, it would not be ju&s;t, to keep a man in an hour's &s;u&s;pen&s;e, when I am in none my&s;elf.</P>
<P>And are you then (angrily) &s;o determined, Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="122">
I am, Sir,</P>
<P>Confound me!&mdash;And yet I am enough confounded!&mdash;But I will not take an an&s;wer &s;o contrary to my hopes. Tell me, madam, by the &s;incerity which you boa&s;t; are you not engaged in your affections? Is there not &s;ome one happy man, whom you prefer to all men?</P>
<P>I am a free per&s;on, Sir Hargrave. It is no impeach|ment of &s;incerity, if a free per&s;on an&s;wers not every que&s;tion that may be put to her, by tho&s;e to whom &s;he is not accountable.</P>
<P>Very true, madam. But as it is no impeachment of your freedom to an&s;wer this que&s;tion either negatively or affirmatively, and as you glory in your frankne&s;s, let me be be&s;eech you to an&s;wer it; Are you, madam, or are you not, di&s;engaged in your affections?</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Sir Hargrave; I don't think you are intitled to an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. Nor, perhaps, would you be determined by the an&s;wer I &s;hould make to it, whether negative or affirmative.</P>
<P>Give me leave to &s;ay, madam, that I have &s;ome little knowledge of Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Greville, and of their addre&s;&s;es. They have both owned, that no hopes have you given them; yet declare that they <HI>will</HI> hope. Have you, madam, been as explicit to them, as you are to me?</P>
<P>I have, Sir.</P>
<P>Then <HI>they</HI> are not the men I have to fear&mdash;Mr. Orme, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Is a good man, Sir.</P>
<P>Ah! madam!&mdash;But why then will you not &s;ay that you are engaged?</P>
<P>If I own I <HI>am;</HI> perhaps it will not avail me: It will much le&s;s, if I &s;ay I am <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Avail</HI> you! dear Mi&s;s Byron! I have pride, madam. If I had not, I &s;hould not a&s;pire to <HI>your</HI> favour: But give me leave to &s;ay [and he reddened with anger] that my fortune, my de&s;cent, and my ardent affection
<PB N="116" REF="123">
for you, con&s;idered, it may not <HI>di&s;</HI>-avail you. Your relations will at lea&s;t think &s;o, if I may have the ho|nour of your con&s;ent for applying to them.</P>
<P>May your fortune, Sir Hargrave, be a ble&s;&s;ing to you. It <HI>will,</HI> as you do good with it. But were it twice as much, that <HI>alone</HI> would have no charms for me. My duties would be increa&s;ed with my power. My fortune is an humble one; but were it le&s;s, it would &s;atisfy my ambition while I am &s;ingle; and if I marry, I &s;hall not de&s;ire to live beyond the e&s;tate of the man I choo&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon my &s;oul, madam, you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be mine. Every word you &s;peak, adds a rivet to my chains.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, let us &s;ay no more upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He then laid a title to my gratitude from the pa&s;&s;ion he avowed for me.</P>
<P>That is a very poor plea, Sir, &s;aid I, as you your&s;elf would think, I believe, were one of our &s;ex, whom you could not like, to claim a return of love from you upon it.</P>
<P>You are too refined, &s;urely, madam.</P>
<P>Refined! what meant the man by the word in this place?</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, we differ very widely in <HI>many</HI> of our &s;entiments.</P>
<P>We will not differ in <HI>one,</HI> madam, when I know yours; &s;uch is the opinion I have of your prudence, that I will adopt them, and make them my own.</P>
<P>This may be <HI>&s;aid,</HI> Sir; but there is hardly a man in the world that, &s;aying it, would keep his word: Nor a woman, who ought to <HI>expect</HI> he &s;hould.</P>
<P>But you will allow of my vi&s;its to your cou&s;ins, madam?</P>
<P>Not on my account, Sir.</P>
<P>You will not withdraw if I come? You will not refu&s;e &s;eeing me?</P>
<P>As you will be no vi&s;itor of mine, I mu&s;t be allowed to act accordingly. Had I the lea&s;t thought of encou|raging
<PB N="117" REF="124">
your addre&s;&s;es, I would deal with you as openly as is con&s;i&s;tent with my notions of mode&s;ty and de|corum.</P>
<P>Perhaps, madam, from my gay behaviour at Lady Betty Williams's, you think me too airy a man. You have doubts of my &s;incerity: You que&s;tion my ho|nour.</P>
<P>That, Sir, would be to injure my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Your <HI>objections,</HI> then, dear madam? Give me, I be&s;eech you, &s;ome one material objection.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, &s;hould you urge me thus?&mdash;When I have no <HI>doubt,</HI> it is unnece&s;&s;ary to look into my own mind for the particular rea&s;ons that move me to di&s;|approve of the addre&s;&s;es of a gentleman who&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions of regard for me, notwith&s;tanding, intitle him to civility and acknowlegement.</P>
<P>By my &s;oul, madam, this is very comical:</P>
<LG>
<L>I do not like thee Dr. <HI>Fell;</HI></L>
<L>The rea&s;on why, I cannot tell&mdash;</L>
<L>But I don't like thee, Dr. <HI>Fell.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>Such, madam, &s;eem to me to be your rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>You are very plea&s;ant, Sir. But let me &s;ay, that if you are in earne&s;t in your profe&s;&s;ions, you could not have quoted any-thing more again&s;t you than the&s;e humorous lines; &s;ince a di&s;like of &s;uch a nature as is implied by them, mu&s;t be a di&s;like ari&s;ing from &s;omething re&s;embling a natural aver&s;ion; whether ju&s;t or not, is little to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I was not aware of that, replied he: But I hope yours to me is not &s;uch a one.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, cou&s;in, &s;aid I, turning to Mrs. Reeves: But I believe I have talked away the tea-time.</P>
<P>I think not of tea, &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Hang tea, &s;aid Mr. Reeves.</P>
<P>The devil fly away with the tea-kettle, &s;aid Sir Hargrave; let it not have entrance here, till I have &s;aid what I have further to &s;ay. And let me tell you,
<PB N="118" REF="125">
Mi&s;s Byron, that tho' you may not have a dying lover, you &s;hall have a re&s;olute one: For I will not cea&s;e pur&s;uing you till you are mine, or till you are the wife of &s;ome other man.</P>
<P>He &s;poke this fiercely, and even rudely. I was di&s;|gu&s;ted as much at his manner, as with his words.</P>
<P>I cannot, replied I, but congratulate my&s;elf on <HI>one</HI> felicity, &s;ince I have been in your company, Sir; and that is, That in this whole conver&s;ation, (and I think it much too long) I have not one thing to reproach my&s;elf with, or be &s;orry for.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, madam, bowing:&mdash;But I am of the <HI>contrary</HI> opinion. By heaven, madam [with anger, and an air of in&s;olence] I think you have pride, madam.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Pride,</HI> Sir!</P>
<P>Cruelty.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Cruelty,</HI> Sir!&mdash;</P>
<P>Ingratitude, madam.</P>
<P>I thought it was &s;taying to be in&s;ulted. All that Sir John Alle&s;tree had &s;aid of him came into my head.</P>
<P>Hold, Sir, (for he &s;eemed to be going on) <HI>Pride, Cruelty, Ingratitude,</HI> are crimes black enough. If you think I am guilty of them, excu&s;e me that I retire for the benefit of recollection.&mdash;And, making a low courte&s;y. I withdrew in ha&s;te. He be&s;ought me to return; and followed me to the &s;tairs foot.</P>
<P>He &s;hewed <HI>his</HI> pride, and his ill-nature too, before my cou&s;ins, when I was gone. He bit his lip: He walked about the room; then &s;itting down, he la|mented, defended, accu&s;ed, and re-defended him&s;elf; and yet be&s;ought their intere&s;t with me.</P>
<P>He was greatly di&s;turbed, he owned, that with <HI>&s;uch</HI> honourable <HI>intetnions,</HI> with &s;o much POWER to make me happy, and <HI>&s;uch</HI> a WILL to do &s;o, he &s;hould be re|fu&s;ed; and this without my a&s;&s;igning one rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>And my cou&s;ins (to whom he again referred on that head) an&s;wering him, that they believed me di&s;engaged in my affections&mdash;D&mdash;him, he &s;aid, if he could ac|count <HI>then</HI> for my behaviour to him.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="126">
He, however, threatned Mr. Orme: Who (if <HI>any)</HI> he &s;aid, was the man I favoured. I had acknowleged, that neither Greville nor Fenwick were. My proud repul&s;e had &s;tung him, he owned. He begged, that they would &s;end for me down in their names.</P>
<P>They liked not the humour he &s;eemed to be in well enough to comply with his reque&s;t; and he &s;ent up in his own name.</P>
<P>But I returned my compliments: I was bu&s;y in writing [And &s;o I was&mdash;to you, my Lucy]; I hoped Sir Hargrave, and my cou&s;ins, would excu&s;e me. I put <HI>them</HI> in, to &s;often my refu&s;al.</P>
<P>This &s;till more di&s;plea&s;ed him. He be&s;ought <HI>their</HI> pardon&punc; but he would haunt me like a gho&s;t. In &s;pite of man and devil I &s;hould be his, he had the pre&s;ump|tion to repeat: And went away with a flaming face.</P>
<P>Don't you think, my dear, that my cou&s;in Reeves was a little too mild in his own hou&s;e; as I am under his guardian&s;hip? But perhaps he was the more pa|tient for that very rea&s;on; and he <HI>is</HI> one of the be&s;t|natured men in England. And then 8000<HI>l.</HI> a year!&mdash;Yet why &s;hould a man of my cou&s;in's independent fortune&mdash;But grandeur will have its charms!</P>
<P>Thus did Sir Hargrave confirm all that Sir John Alle&s;tree had &s;aid of his bad qualities: And I think I am more afraid of him than ever I was of any man before. I remember, that <HI>mi&s;chievous</HI> is one of the bad qualities Sir John attributed to him: And <HI>revenge|ful</HI> another. Should I ever &s;ee him again, on the &s;ame errand, I will be more explicit, as to my being ab|&s;olutely di&s;engaged in my affections, if I can be &s;o without giving him hope, le&s;t he &s;hould do private mi&s;chief to &s;ome one on my account. Upon my word, I would not, of all the men I have ever &s;een, be the wife of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen.</P>
<P>And &s;o much for this fir&s;t vi&s;it of his. I wi&s;h his pride may be enough piqued to make it the la&s;t.</P>
<P>But could you have thought he would have &s;hewn
<PB N="120" REF="127">
him&s;elf &s;o &s;oon?&mdash;Yet he had paraded &s;o much, be|fore I went down, to my cou&s;ins, and &s;o little expect|ed a direct and determined repul&s;e, that a man of his &s;elf-con&s;equence might, perhaps, be allowed to be the more ea&s;ily piqued by it.</P>
<P>Lady Betty has &s;ent us notice, that on Thur&s;day next, there will be a ball at the Opera-hou&s;e in the Hay-market. My cou&s;ins are to choo&s;e what they will be; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ts, that my dre&s;s &s;hall be left to her. I am not to know what it is to be, till the day before, or the very day. If I like it not, &s;he will not put me to any expence about it.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily imagine, upon &s;uch an alternative, I &s;hall approve of it, be it what it will. I have only reque&s;ted, that I may not be &s;o remarkably dre&s;&s;ed, as to attract the eyes of the company: If I am, I &s;hall not behave with any tolerable pre&s;ence of mind.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, Feb. 10.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ONE of Mr. Greville's &s;ervants has ju&s;t been here, with his ma&s;ter's compliments. So the wretch is come to town. I believe I &s;hall &s;oon be able to oblige him: He wi&s;hes, you know, to provoke me to &s;ay I <HI>hate</HI> him.</P>
<P>Surely I draw inconveniencies upon my&s;elf by being &s;o willing to pay civility for e&s;teem. Yet it is in my nature to do &s;o, and I can't help it without commit|ting a kind of violence on my temper. There is no merit, therefore, in my behaviour, on &s;uch occa&s;ions. Very pretty &s;elf-deception!&mdash;I &s;tudy my own ea&s;e, and (before I con&s;ider) am ready to call my&s;elf patient, and good-humoured, and civil, and to attribute to my&s;elf I know not how many kind and complai&s;ant things, when I ought, in mode&s;ty, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>virtue</HI> and the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></P>

I never was uncivil, as I call it, but to one young gentleman; a man of quality (you know who I mean); and that was, becau&s;e he wanted me to keep &s;ecret his addre&s;&s;es to me, for family con&s;iderations. The young woman who engages to keep her lover's &s;ecrets in this particular, is often brought into a plot again&s;t her&s;elf, and oftener &s;till again&s;t tho&s;e to whom &s;he owes unre|&s;erved honour and duty: And is not &s;uch a conduct al&s;o an indirect confe&s;&s;ion, that you know you are en|gaging in &s;omething wrong and unworthy?</P>

<P>I SHALL have nothing to trouble you with, I think, but &s;cenes of court&s;hip. Sir Rowland, Sir Hargrave, and Mr. Greville, all met ju&s;t now at our breakfa&s;t|time.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland came fir&s;t; a little before breakfa&s;t was ready. After enquiries of Mr. Reeves, whether I held in the &s;ame mind, or not; he de&s;ired to have the fa|vour of one quarter of an hour's conver&s;ation with me alone.</P>
<P>Methinks I have a value for this hone&s;t knight. Hone&s;ty, my Lucy, is good &s;en&s;e, politene&s;s, amiable|ne&s;s, all in one. An hone&s;t man mu&s;t appear in every light with &s;uch advantages, as will make even <HI>&s;ingu|larity</HI> agreeable. I went down directly.</P>
<P>He met me; and taking my not-withdrawn hand, and peering in my face, Mercy, &s;aid he; the &s;ame kind a&s;pect! The &s;ame &s;weet and obliging countenance! How can this be? But you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be gracious! You <HI>will.</HI> Say you will.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not urge me, Sir Rowland. You will give me pain if you lay me under a nece&s;&s;ity to re|peal&mdash;</P>
<P>Repeat what? Don't &s;ay a re&s;u&s;al. Dear madam,
<PB N="122" REF="129">
don't &s;ay a re&s;u&s;al! Will you not &s;ave a life? Why, madam, my poor boy is ab&s;olutely and <HI>bona fide</HI> broken-hearted. I would have had him come with me: But, no, he could not bear to teaze the beloved of his &s;oul! Why there's an in&s;tance of love now! Not for all his hopes, not for his life's &s;ake, could he bear to teaze you! None of your &s;luttering Jack-a dandy's, now, would have &s;aid this! And let not &s;uch &s;ucceed, where mode&s;t merit fails!&mdash;Mercy! You are &s;truck with my plea! Don't, don't, God ble&s;s you now, don't harden your heart on my ob&s;ervation. I was re&s;olved to &s;et out in a day or two: But I will &s;tay in town, were it a month, to &s;ee my boy made happy. And, let me tell you, I would not wi&s;h him to be happy unle&s;s he could make you &s;o.&mdash;Come, come&mdash;</P>
<P>I was a little affected. I was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Come, come, be gracious; be merciful. Dear lady, be as good as you look to be. One word of comfort for my poor boy. I could kneel to you for one word of comfort&mdash;Nay, I <HI>will</HI> kneel; taking hold of my other hand, as he &s;till held one; and down on his knees dropt the hone&s;t knight.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed. I knew not what to &s;ay, what to do. I had not the courage to attempt to lift him up. Yet to &s;ee a man of his years, and who had given him&s;elf a claim to my e&s;teem, kneel; and, with gli&s;ten|ing eyes, looking up to me for <HI>mercy,</HI> as he called it, on his <HI>boy;</HI> how was I affected!&mdash;But, at la&s;t, Ri&s;e, dear Sir Rowland, ri&s;e, &s;aid I: You call out for mercy to me; yet have none upon me. O how you di&s;tre&s;s me!</P>
<P>I would have withdrawn my hands; but he held them fa&s;t. I &s;tamped in tender pa&s;&s;ion [I am <HI>&s;ure</HI> it was in <HI>tender</HI> pa&s;&s;ion] now with one foot, now with the other; Dear Sir Rowland, ri&s;e! I cannot bear this. I be&s;eech you ri&s;e [And down I dropt involun|tarily on one knee]. What can I &s;ay? Ri&s;e, dear Sir,
<PB N="123" REF="130">
on <HI>my</HI> knee I beg of you kneel not to me? Indeed, Sir, you greatly di&s;tre&s;s me! Pray let go my hands.</P>
<P>Tears ran down his cheeks&mdash;And <HI>do</HI> I di&s;tre&s;s you, madam! And <HI>do</HI> you vouch&s;afe to kneel to me?&mdash;I will <HI>not</HI> di&s;tre&s;s you: For the <HI>world</HI> I will not di&s;tre&s;s you.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e, and let go my hands, I aro&s;e too, aba&s;hed. He pulled out his handkerchief, and ha&s;tening from me to the window, wiped his eyes. Then turning to me, What a fool I am! What a mere child I make of my&s;elf! How can I blame my boy? O madam! have you not one word of comfort to &s;end by me to my boy? Say, but, you will &s;ee him. Give him leave to wait on you: Yet, poor &s;oul! (wiping his eyes again) he would not be able to &s;ay a word in his own behalf.&mdash;Bid me bring him to you: Bid us come together.</P>
<P>And &s;o I could, and &s;o I would, Sir Rowland, if no other expectations were to be formed than tho&s;e of civility. But I will go farther to &s;hew my regard for you, Sir: Let me be happy in your friend&s;hip, and good opinion: Let me look upon you as my Fa|ther: Let me look upon Mr. Fowler as my Brother: I am not &s;o happy, as to have either father or brother. And let Mr. Fowler own me as his Si&s;ter; and every vi&s;it you make me, you will both, in the&s;e characters, be dearer to me than before.&mdash;But, O my father! (already will I call you father!) Urge not your daugh|ter to an impo&s;&s;ibility&punc;</P>
<P>Mercy! Mercy! What will become of me! What will become of my boy, rather!</P>
<P>He turned from me, with his handkerchief at his eyes again, and even &s;obbed: Where are all my pur|po&s;es&punc; Irre&s;i&s;tible Lady!&mdash;But mu&s;t I give up my hopes? Mu&s;t my boy be told&mdash;And yet, do you call me <HI>fa|ther;</HI> and do you plead for my indulgence as if you were my <HI>daughter?</HI></P>
<P>Indeed I do; indeed I mu&s;t. I have told Mr. Fow|ler,
<PB N="124" REF="131">
with &s;o much regard for him, as an hone&s;t, as a worthy man&mdash;</P>
<P>Why that's the weapon that wounds him, that cuts him to the heart! Your gentlene&s;s, your openne&s;s&mdash;And <HI>are</HI> you determined? Can there be <HI>no</HI> hope?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fowler</HI> is my <HI>brother,</HI> Sir; and <HI>you</HI> are my <HI>fa|ther.</HI>&mdash;Accept me in tho&s;e characters.</P>
<P>Accept you! Mercy! Accept you?&mdash;Forgive me, madam (catching my hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it with his lips) you do me honour in the appellation: But if your mind &s;hould change on con&s;ideration, and from motives of pity&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, indeed, Sir Rowland, it cannot change.</P>
<P>Why then, I, as well as my nephew, mu&s;t acquie&s;ce with your plea&s;ure. But, madam, you don't know what a worthy creature he is. I will not, however, teaze you?&mdash;But how, but how, &s;hall I &s;ee Mr. Reeves? I am a&s;hamed to &s;ee him with this baby in my face.</P>
<P>And I, Sir Rowland, mu&s;t retire before I can ap|pear. Excu&s;e me, Sir (withdrawing); but I hope you will breakfa&s;t with us.</P>
<P>I will drink tea with you, madam, if I can make my&s;elf fit to be &s;een, were it but to claim you for my <HI>daughter:</HI> But yet had much rather you would be a farther remove in relation: Would to God you would let it be <HI>neice!</HI></P>
<P>I courti&s;ied, as a daughter might do, parting with her real father; and withdrew.</P>
<P>And now, my Lucy, will you not be convinced that one of the greate&s;t pains (the lo&s;s of dear friends excepted) that a grateful mind can know, is to be too much beloved by a worthy heart, and not to be able to return his love?</P>
<P>My &s;heet is ended. With a new one I will begin another Letter.&mdash;Yet a few words in the margin&mdash;I tell you not, my dear, of the public entertainments to which lady Betty is continually contriving to draw me out. She intends by it to be very obliging, and is
<PB N="125" REF="132">
&s;o: But my pre&s;ent reluctance to go &s;o very often, mu&s;t not be overcome, as it po&s;&s;ibly would be too ea&s;ily done, were I to give way to the temptation. If it be, your Harriet may turn gadfly, and never be ea&s;y but when &s;he is forming parties, or giving way to them, that may make the home, that hitherto has been the chief &s;cene of her plea&s;ures, undelightful to her. Bad habits are &s;ooner acquired than &s;haken off, as my grandmamma has often told us.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>WHO would have thought that a man of Sir Row|land's time of life, and a woman &s;o young as I, could have &s;o much di&s;compo&s;ed each other? I obey'd the &s;ummons to breakfa&s;t, and enter'd the room at one door, as he came in at the other. In vain had I made u&s;e of the &s;hort retirement to conceal my emo|tion from my cou&s;ins. They al&s;o &s;aw Sir Rowland's by his eyes, and looked at him, at me, and at each other.</P>
<P>Mercy! &s;aid Sir Rowland, in an accent that &s;eem'd between crying and laughing, You, you, you, madam, are a &s;urpri&s;ing lady! I, I, I, never was &s;o affected in my life. And he drew the back of his hand cro&s;s fir&s;t one eye, then the other.</P>
<P>O Sir Rowland, &s;aid I, you are a good man. How affecting are the vi&s;ible emotions of a manly heart!</P>
<P>My cou&s;ins &s;till looked as if &s;urpriz'd; but &s;aid no|thing.</P>
<P>O my cou&s;ins, &s;aid I, I have found a father in Sir Rowland; and I acknowlege a brother in Mr. Fowler.</P>
<P>Be&s;t of women! Mo&s;t excellent of creatures! And do you <HI>own</HI> me? He &s;natched my hand, and ki&s;s'd it. What pride do you give me in this open acknowlege|ment! If it mu&s;t not be <HI>niece,</HI> why then I will en|deavour to rejoice in my <HI>daughter,</HI> I think. But yet,
<PB N="126" REF="133">
my boy, my poor boy&mdash;But you are all goodne&s;s: And with him I &s;ay, I mu&s;t not teaze you.</P>
<P>What you have been &s;aying to each other alone, &s;aid Mrs. Reeves, I cannot tell: But I long to know.</P>
<P>Why, madam, I will tell you&mdash;if I know how&mdash;You mu&s;t know, that I, that I, came as an amba&s;&s;a|dor-extraordinary from my &s;orrowful boy: Yet not de&s;ired; not &s;ent; I came of my own accord, in hopes of getting one word of comfort, and to bring matters on before I &s;et out for Caermarthen.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant coming in, and a loud rap, rap, rap, on the footman's mu&s;ical in&s;trument, the knocker of the door, put a &s;top to Sir Rowland's narrative. In apprehen&s;ion of company, I breathed on my hand, and put it to either eye; and Sir Rowland hemmed twice or thrice, and rubbed his, the better to conceal their redne&s;s, tho' it made them redder than before. He got up, look'd at the gla&s;s: Would have &s;ung. <HI>Toll, doll</HI>&mdash;Hem, &s;aid he; as if the mu&s;cles of his face were in the power of his voice. Mercy! All the infant &s;till in my eye&mdash;<HI>Toll, doll</HI>&mdash;Hem!&mdash;I would &s;ing it away if I could.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave enter'd bowing, &s;craping to me, and with an air not ungraceful.</P>
<P>Servant, Sir, &s;aid the knight (to Sir Hargrave's &s;ilent &s;alute to him) bowing, and looking at the baronet's genteel morning dre&s;s, and then at his own&mdash;Who the duce is <HI>he!</HI> whi&s;pering to Mr. Reeves; Who then pre&s;ented each to the other by nam&eacute;.</P>
<P>The baronet approached me; I have, madam, a thou&s;and pardons to a&s;k&mdash;</P>
<P>Not one, Sir.</P>
<P>Indeed I have&mdash;And mo&s;t heartily do I beg&mdash;</P>
<P>You are forgiven, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>But I will not be &s;o <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> forgiven.</P>
<P>Mercy! whi&s;pered the knight to Mr. Reeves, I don't liken, Ah! my poor boy: No wonder at this rate!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="134">
You have not much to fear, Sir Rowland, (re|whi&s;per'd my cou&s;in) on this gentleman's account.</P>
<P>Thank you, thank you&mdash;And yet 'tis a fine figure of a man! whi&s;per'd again Sir Rowland: Nay, if &s;he can with&s;tand <HI>him</HI>&mdash;But a word to the wi&s;e, Mr. Reeves!&mdash;Hem!&mdash;I am a little ea&s;ier than I was.</P>
<P>He turned from my cou&s;in with &s;uch an air, as if from contra&s;ted plea&s;ure and pain, he would again have &s;ung <HI>Toll, doll.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ervant came in with the breakfa&s;t: And we had no &s;ooner &s;at down, as before, than we were alarmed by another modern rapping. Mr. Reeves was called out, and return'd, introducing Mr. Greville.</P>
<P>Who the duce is <HI>he?</HI> whi&s;per'd to me Sir Rowland (as he &s;at next me) before Mr. Reeves could name him.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville profoundly bowed to me. I a&s;ked after the health of all our friends in Northampton|&s;hire.</P>
<P>Have you &s;een Fenwick, madam?&mdash;No, Sir.</P>
<P>A dog! I thought he had played me a trick. I mi&s;&s;ed him for three days&mdash;But (in a low voice) if you have not &s;een him, I have &s;tolen a march upon <HI>him!</HI>&mdash;Well, I had rather a&s;k <HI>his</HI> pardon than he &s;hould a&s;k <HI>mine.</HI> I rejoice to &s;ee you well, madam! (rai&s;ing his voice)&mdash;But what!&mdash;looking at my eyes.</P>
<P>Colds are very rife in London, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>I am glad it is no wor&s;e; for your grandmamma, and all friends in the country, are well.</P>
<P>I have found a papa, Mr. Greville (referring to Sir Rowland) &s;ince I came to town. This good gentle|man gives me leave to call him father.</P>
<P>No <HI>&s;on!</HI>&mdash;I hope, Sir Rowland, you have no &s;on, &s;aid Mr. Greville; The relation comes not about that way, I hope. And laughed, as he u&s;ed to do, at his own &s;martne&s;s.</P>
<P>The very que&s;tion, I was going to put, by my &s;oul, &s;aid the baronet.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="135">
No!&mdash;&s;aid the knight: But I have a <HI>nephew,</HI> gentlemen&mdash;A very pretty young fellow! And I have this to &s;ay before ye all (I am downright Dun&s;table) I had much rather call this Lady <HI>niece,</HI> than <HI>daughter.</HI> And then the knight forced a laugh, and looked round upon us all.</P>
<P>O Sir Rowland, replied I, I <HI>have</HI> uncles, more than one&mdash;I <HI>am</HI> a niece: But I have not had for many years till now the happine&s;s of a father.</P>
<P>And do you own me, madam, before all this gay company?&mdash;The fir&s;t time I beheld you, I remember I called you a perfect paragon. Why, madam, you are the mo&s;t excellent of women!</P>
<P>We are &s;o much convinced of this, Sir Rowland, &s;aid the Baronet, that I don't know, but Mi&s;s Byron's choo&s;ing you for a <HI>father,</HI> in&s;tead of an <HI>uncle,</HI> may have &s;aved two or three throats. And then he laugh'd. His laugh was the more &s;ea&s;onable, as it &s;often'd the &s;hockingne&s;s of his expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville and the Baronet had been in company twice before in Northampton&s;hire at the races: But now-and-then look'd upon each other with envious eyes; and once or twice were at cro&s;s-purpo&s;es: But my particular notice of the knight made all pa&s;s lightly over.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland went fir&s;t away. He claimed one word with his <HI>daughter,</HI> in the character of a <HI>father.</HI></P>
<P>I withdrew with him to the farther end of the room.</P>
<P>Not <HI>one</HI> word of comfort? not <HI>one</HI> word, madam?&mdash;to my boy? whi&s;per'd he.</P>
<P>My compliments (&s;peaking low) to my <HI>brother,</HI> Sir&punc; I wi&s;h him as well and as happy as I think he de&s;erves to be.</P>
<P>Well but&mdash;Well but&mdash;</P>
<P>Only remember, Sir Rowland, that you act in cha|racter. I followed you hither, on the &s;trength of your authority, as a <HI>father;</HI> I beg, Sir, that you will pre&s;erve to me that character.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="136">
Why God in heaven ble&s;s my daughter, if <HI>only</HI> daughter you can be. Too well do I under&s;tand you! I will &s;ee how my poor nephew will take it. If it <HI>can</HI> be no otherwi&s;e, I will prevail upon him, I think, to go down with me to Caermarthen for a few months.&mdash;But as to tho&s;e two fine gentlemen, madam&mdash;It would grieve me ('tis a folly to deny it) to &s;ay I have &s;een the man that is to &s;upplant my nephew.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> will act in character, Sir Rowland: As your <HI>daughter,</HI> you have a right to know my &s;entiments on this &s;ubject&mdash;You have not <HI>yet</HI> &s;een the man you &s;eem to be afraid of.</P>
<P>You are all goodne&s;s, madam&mdash;my <HI>daughter</HI>&mdash;and I cannot bear it!</P>
<P>He &s;poke this loud enough to be heard; and Mr. Greville and the baronet both, with &s;ome emotion, ro&s;e, and turned about to us.</P>
<P>Once more, Sir Rowland, &s;aid I, my compliments to my <HI>brother</HI>&mdash;Adieu!</P>
<P>God in heaven ble&s;s you, madam, that's all&mdash;Gen|tlemen, your &s;ervant; Mrs. Reeves, your mo&s;t obe|dient humble &s;ervant. Madam, to me, you will allow me, and my nephew too, one more vi&s;it, I hope be|fore I &s;et out for Caermarthen.</P>
<P>I courte&s;ied, and joined my cou&s;ins. Away went the knight, bru&s;hing the ground with his hat, at his going out. Mr. Reeves waited on him to the outward door.</P>
<P>'Bye, 'bye, to you, Mr. Reeves&mdash;with &s;ome emo|tion (as my cou&s;in told me afterwards)&mdash;A wonderful creature! By mercy, a wonderful creature!&mdash;I go away with my heart full; yet am plea&s;ed; I know not why, neither, that's the je&s;t of it&mdash;'Bye, Mrs. Reeves: I can &s;tay no longer.</P>
<P>An odd mortal! &s;aid the <HI>man of the town</HI>&mdash;But he &s;eems to know on which &s;ide his bread is buttered.</P>
<P>A whim&s;ical old fellow! &s;aid the <HI>man of the country.</HI> But I rejoice that he has not a <HI>&s;on;</HI> that's all.</P>
<P>A good many frothy things pa&s;&s;ed not worth relate|ing.
<PB N="130" REF="137">
I wanted them both to be gone. They &s;eemed each to think it time; but looked as if neither cared to leave the other behind him.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Mr. Greville, who hinted to me, that he knew I loved not too long an intru&s;ion, bowed, and, politely enough, took his leave. And then the Baronet began, with apoligizing for his behaviour at taking leave on his la&s;t vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen, I &s;aid, had one way, &s;ome an|other, of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves on particular occa&s;ions. He had thought fit to &s;hew me what was his.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed a little di&s;concerted. But quickly recover|ing him&s;elf, he could not indeed excu&s;e him&s;elf, he &s;aid, for having then called me <HI>cruel</HI>&mdash;Cruel, he hoped he &s;hould not find me&mdash;<HI>Proud</HI>&mdash;I knew not what pride was. <HI>Ungrateful</HI>&mdash;I could not be guilty of ingratitude. He begged me to forgive his peremptorine&s;s&mdash;He had hoped (as he had been a&s;&s;ured, that my affections were ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged) that the propo&s;als he had to make, would have been acceptable; and &s;o po&s;itive a re&s;u&s;al, without any one rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, and on his fir&s;t vi&s;it, had indeed hurt his pride (he owned, he &s;aid, that he had &s;ome pride) and made him forget that he was addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to a woman who de|&s;erved, and met with, the veneration of every one who approached her. He next expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with ap|prehen&s;ions on Mr. Greville's arrival in town. He &s;poke &s;lightly of him. Mr. Greville, I doubt not, will &s;peak as &s;lightly of Sir Hargrave. And if I believe them both, I fan&s;y I &s;hall not injure either.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville's arrival, I &s;aid, ought not to concern me. He was to do as he thought fit. I was only de|&s;irous to be allowed the &s;ame free agency that I was ready to allow to others.</P>
<P>That could not be, he &s;aid. Every man who &s;aw me mu&s;t wi&s;h me to be his; and endeavour to obtain his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>And then making vehement profe&s;&s;ions of Love, he
<PB N="131" REF="138">
offered me large &s;ettlements; and to put it in my power to do all the good that he knew it was in my heart to do&mdash;And that I &s;hould pre&s;cribe to him in every thing as to place of re&s;idence, excur&s;ions, even to the going abroad to France, to Italy, and where|ever I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>To all which I an&s;wered as before; and when he in&s;i&s;ted upon my rea&s;ons for re&s;u&s;ing him, I frankly told him, tho' I owned it was with &s;ome reluctance, that I had not the opinion of his morals that I mu&s;t have of tho&s;e of the man to whom I gave my hand in marriage.</P>
<P>Of my <HI>morals,</HI> madam! (&s;tarting; and his colour went and came) My <HI>morals,</HI> madam!&mdash;I thought he looked with malice: But I was not intimidated: And yet my cou&s;ins looked at me with &s;ome little &s;urprize for my plain dealing, tho' not as blaming me.</P>
<P>Be not di&s;plea&s;ed, Sir, with my freedom. You call upon me to make objections. I mean not to upbraid you; that is not <HI>my</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s; but thus called upon, I mu&s;t repeat&mdash;I &s;topt.</P>
<P>Proceed, madam; angrily.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir Hargrave, you mu&s;t pardon me on <HI>this</HI> occa&s;ion, if I repeat that I have not that opinion of your morals&mdash;</P>
<P>Very well, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>That I mu&s;t have of tho&s;e of the man on who&s;e worthine&s;s I mu&s;t build my hopes of <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> happine&s;s, and to who&s;e guidance intru&s;t my <HI>future.</HI> This, Sir, is a very material con&s;ideration with me, tho' I am not fond of talking upon it, except on <HI>proper</HI> occa&s;ions, and to <HI>proper</HI> per&s;ons: But, Sir, let me add, that I am determined to live longer &s;ingle. I think it too early to engage in a life of care: And if I do not meet with a man to whom I can give my whole heart, I never will marry at all [O how maliciou&s;ly looked the man!]&mdash;You are angry, Sir Hargrave, added I; but you have no right to be &s;o. You addre&s;s me as
<PB N="132" REF="139">
one who is her own mi&s;tre&s;s. And tho' I would not be thought rude, I value my&s;elf on my openne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e from his &s;eat. He walked about the room muttering, "You have no opinion of my morals"&mdash;By heaven, madam!&mdash;But I will bear it all&mdash;Yet, "No opinion of my morals!"&mdash;I cannot bear that&mdash;</P>
<P>He then clenched his fi&s;t, and held it up to his head; and &s;natching up his hat, bowing to the ground to us all, his face crim&s;oned over (as the time before) he withdrew.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves attended him to the door&mdash;"Not like my morals!" &s;aid he&mdash;I have <HI>enemies,</HI> Mr. Reeves&mdash;"Not like my morals!"&mdash;Mi&s;s Byron treats politely every body but me, Sir. Her &s;corn may be repaid&mdash;Would to God I could &s;ay with &s;corn, Mr. Reeves.&mdash;Adieu. Excu&s;e my warmth.&mdash;Adieu.</P>
<P>And into his chariot he &s;tept, pulling up the gla&s;&s;es with violence; and, as Mr. Reeves told us, rearing up his head to the top of it, as he &s;at &s;welling. And away it drove.</P>
<P>His menacing airs, and abrupt departure, terrified me. I did not recover my&s;elf in an hour.</P>
<P>A fine hu&s;band for your Harriet would this half madman make!&mdash;O Mr. Fowler, Sir Rowland, Mr. Orme, what good men are you to Sir Hargrave! Should I have known half &s;o much as I do of his ill qualities, had I not refu&s;ed him? Drawn in by his profe&s;&s;ions of Love, and by 8000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, I might have married him; and, when too late, found my&s;elf mi&s;erable, yoked with a tyrant and madman, for the remainder of a life begun with happy pro&s;pects, and glorying in every one's Love!</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, February 13.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received my uncle's long Letter: And I thank him for the pains he has taken with me. He is very good: But my grandmamma and my aunt are equally &s;o, and, in the main, much kinder, in ac|quitting me of &s;ome charges which he is plea&s;ed to make upon his poor Harriet. But, either for caution, or reproof, I hope to be the better for his Letter.</P>
<P>James is &s;et out for Northampton&s;hire: Pray re|ceive him kindly. He is hone&s;t: And Sally has given me an hint, as if a &s;weet-heart is in his head: If &s;o, his impatience to leave London may be accounted for. My grandmamma has ob&s;erved, that young people of &s;mall or no fortunes &s;hould not be di&s;couraged from marrying: Who that could be ma&s;ters or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es would be &s;ervants? The hone&s;t poor, as &s;he has of|ten &s;aid, are a very valuable part of the creation.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves has &s;een &s;everal footmen, but none that he gave me the trouble of &s;peaking to, till ju&s;t now; when a well-looking young man, about twenty|&s;ix years of age, offered him&s;elf, and whom I believe I &s;hall like. Mrs. Reeves &s;eems mightily taken with him. He is well-behaved, has a very &s;en&s;ible look, and &s;eems to merit a better &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves has written for a character of him to the la&s;t ma&s;ter he lived with; Mr. Bagenhall, a young gentleman in the neighbourhood of Reading: Of whom he &s;peaks well in the main; but mode&s;tly ob|jected to his hours, and free way of life. The young man came to town but ye&s;terday, and is with a widow &s;i&s;ter, who keeps an inn in Smithfield. I have a <HI>mind</HI> to like him, and this makes me more particular about him.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="141">
His name is William Wil&s;on: He a&s;ks pretty high wages: But wages to a good &s;ervant are not to be &s;tood upon. What &s;ignify forty or fifty &s;hillings a year? An hone&s;t &s;ervant &s;hould be enabled to lay up &s;omething for age and infirmity. Hire him at once, Mrs. Reeves &s;ays. She will be an&s;werable for his hone&s;ty, from his looks, and from his an&s;wers to the que&s;tions a&s;ked him.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave has been here again. Mrs. Revees, Mi&s;s Dolyns, Mi&s;s Clements, and I, were in the back room together. We had drank tea; and I excu&s;ed my&s;elf to his me&s;&s;age, as engaged.</P>
<P>He talked a good deal to Mr. Reeves: Sometimes high, &s;ometimes humble. He had not intended, he &s;aid, to have renewed his vi&s;its. My di&s;dain had &s;tung him to the heart: Yet he could not keep away. He called him&s;elf names. He was determined I &s;hould be his; and &s;wore to it. A man of his fortune to be refu&s;ed, by a Lady who had not (and whom he wi&s;hed not to have) an an&s;werable fortune, and no pre&s;erable liking to any other man [There Sir Har|grave was mi&s;taken; for I like almo&s;t every man I know, better than him]; his per&s;on not contemptible [And then, my cou&s;in &s;ays, he &s;urveyed him&s;elf from head to foot in the gla&s;s]; was very, <HI>very</HI> unaccountable.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked if Mr. Greville came up with any hopes?</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves told him that I was offended at his coming; and he was &s;ure he would not be the better for his journey.</P>
<P>He was glad of that, he &s;aid. There were two or three free things, proceeded he, &s;aid to me in conver|&s;ation by Mr. Greville; which I knew not well what to make of: But they &s;hall pa&s;s, if he has no more to boa&s;t of than I. I know Mr. Greville's blu&s;tering character; but I wi&s;h the carrying of Mi&s;s Byron were to depend upon the &s;word's point between us. I would not come into &s;o paltry a compromi&s;e with him as Fenwick has done. But &s;till the imputing
<PB N="135" REF="142">
want of <HI>morals</HI> to me, &s;ticks with me. Surely I am a better man in point of morals, than either Greville or Fenwick. What man on earth does not take li|berties with the Sex? Hay, you know, Mr. Reeves! Women were made for us: And they like us not the wor&s;e for loving them. <HI>Want of morals!</HI>&mdash;And ob|jected to me by a <HI>lady!</HI>&mdash;Very extraordinary, by my &s;oul!&mdash;Is it not better to &s;ow all one's wild oats before matrimony, than run riot afterwards?&mdash;What &s;ay you, Mr. Reeves?</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves was too patient with him. He is a mild man: Yet wants not &s;pirit, my cou&s;in &s;ays, on occa&s;ion. He gave Sir Hargrave the hearing; who went away, &s;wearing, that I &s;hould be his, in &s;pite of man or devil.</P>

<P>MR. Greville came in the Evening. He begged to be allowed but ten words with me in the next room. I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. You know, Sir, &s;aid I, that I never complied with a reque&s;t of this nature, at Selby-hou&s;e. He looked hard at my cou&s;ins; and fir&s;t one, then the other, went out. He then was &s;olicitous to know what were Sir Hargrave's expecta|tions from me. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf unea&s;y upon his account. He hoped &s;uch a man as <HI>that</HI> would not be encouraged. Yet his ample fortune&mdash;Woman! woman!&mdash;But he was neither a wi&s;er nor a better man than him&s;elf: And he hoped Mi&s;s Byron would not give a preference to fortune <HI>merely,</HI> again&s;t a man who <HI>had</HI> been her admirer for &s;o long a time; and who wanted neither will nor power to make her happy.</P>
<P>It was very irk&s;ome to me, I an&s;wered, to be ob|liged &s;o often to repeat the &s;ame things to him. I would not be thought a&s;&s;ronting to any-body, e&s;pe|cially to a neighbour with whom my friends were upon good terms: But I did not think my&s;elf an&s;wer|able to him, or to any one out of my own family,
<PB N="136" REF="143">
for my vi&s;itors; or for whom my cou&s;in Reeves's thought fit to receive as theirs.</P>
<P>Would I give him an a&s;&s;urance, that Sir Hargrave &s;hould have no encouragement?</P>
<P>No, Sir, I will not. Would not that be to give you indirectly a kind of controul over me? Would not that be to encourage an hope, that I never <HI>will</HI> en|courage?</P>
<P>I love not my own &s;oul, madam, as I love you: I mu&s;t, and will per&s;evere. If I thought Sir Hargrave had the lea&s;t hope, by the great God of heaven, I would pronounce his days numbered.</P>
<P>I am but too well acquainted with your ra&s;hne&s;s, Mr. Greville. What formerly pa&s;&s;ed between you and another gentleman, gave me pain enough. In &s;uch an enterprize your own days might be numbered as well as another's. But I enter not into this &s;ub|ject&mdash;<HI>Henceforth</HI> be &s;o good as not to impute incivility to me, if I deny my&s;elf to your vi&s;its.</P>
<P>I would have withdrawn&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear Mi&s;s Byron (&s;tepping between me and the door) leave me not in anger. If matters <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;tand as they were, I hope you <HI>can,</HI> I hope you <HI>will,</HI> a&s;&s;ure me, that this Sir Fopling&mdash;</P>
<P>What right have you, Sir, to any a&s;&s;urance of this nature from me?</P>
<P>None, madam.&mdash;But from your goodne&s;s&mdash;Dear Mi&s;s Byron, <HI>conde&s;cend</HI> to &s;ay, that this Sir Hargrave &s;hall not make any impre&s;&s;ion on your heart. For <HI>his &s;ake</HI> &s;ay it, if not for <HI>mine.</HI> I know you care not what becomes of <HI>me;</HI> yet let not this milk-faced, and tyger-hearted fop, for that is his character, obtain fa|vour from you. Let your choice, if it mu&s;t fall on another man, and not on me, fall on one to who&s;e &s;uperior merit, and to who&s;e good fortune, I can &s;ub|&s;cribe. For your own fame's &s;ake, let a man of un|que&s;tionable honour be the happy man; and vouch|&s;afe as to a neighbour, and as to a well-wi&s;hing friend,
<PB N="137" REF="144">
only (I a&s;k it not in the light of a Lover) to tell me that Sir Hargrave Pollexfen &s;hall not be the man?</P>
<P>What, Mr. Greville, let me a&s;k you, is your bu&s;i|ne&s;s in town?</P>
<P>My <HI>chief</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s, madam, you may gue&s;s at. I had an hint of this man's intentions given me; and that he has the vanity to think he &s;hall &s;ucceed. But if I can be a&s;&s;ured, that you will not be prevailed upon in favour of a man who&s;e fortune is &s;o ample&mdash;</P>
<P>You will then return to Northampton&s;hire?</P>
<P>Why, madam, I can't but &s;ay that now I am in town, and that I have be&s;poke a new equipage, and &s;o-forth&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, it is nothing to me, what you will or will not do: Only be plea&s;ed to remember, that as in Northampton&s;hire your vi&s;its were to my uncle Selby, not to me, they will be here in London, to my cou&s;in Reeves's only.</P>
<P>Too well do I know that you can be cruel if you will: But is it your <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> that I return to the country?</P>
<P>My <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> Sir! Mr. Greville is &s;urely to do as he plea&s;es. I only wi&s;h to be allowed the &s;ame li|berty.</P>
<P>You are &s;o very delicate, Mi&s;s Byron! So very much afraid of giving the lea&s;t advantage&mdash;</P>
<P>And men are &s;o ready to take advantage&mdash;But yet, Mr. Greville, not &s;o delicate as ju&s;t. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that if I were not determined&mdash;</P>
<P>Determined!&mdash;Yes, yes! You can be <HI>&s;teady,</HI> as Mr. Selby calls it! I never knew &s;o determined a woman in my life. I own, it was a little inconvenient for me to come to town ju&s;t now: And &s;ay, that you would <HI>wi&s;h</HI> me to leave London; and that neither <HI>this Sir Hargrave,</HI> nor <HI>that other man,</HI> your <HI>new fa|ther's</HI> nephew (What do you call him? Fore-gad, madam, I am afraid of the&s;e new relations) &s;hall make any impre&s;&s;ion on your heart; and that you will not
<PB N="138" REF="145">
withdraw when I come here; and I will &s;et out next week; and write this very night to let Fenwick know how matters &s;tand, and that I am coming down but little the better for my journey: And this may &s;ave you &s;eeing your other tormentor, as your cou&s;in Lucy &s;ays you once called that poor devil, and the &s;till poorer devil before you.</P>
<P>You are &s;o ra&s;h a man, Mr. Greville (and <HI>other</HI> men may be as ra&s;h as you) that I cannot &s;ay but it would &s;ave me &s;ome pain&mdash;</P>
<P>O take care, take care, Mi&s;s Byron, that you expre&s;s your&s;elf &s;o cautiou&s;ly, as to give no advantage to a poor dog, who would be glad to take a journey to the farthe&s;t part of the globe to oblige you. But what &s;ay you about this Sir Hargrave, and about your <HI>new brother?</HI>&mdash;Let me tell you, madam, I am &s;o much afraid of tho&s;e whining, in&s;inuating, creeping dogs, attacking you on the &s;ide of your compa&s;&s;ion, and be d&mdash;n'd to them (Orme for that) that I mu&s;t have a declaration. And now, madam, can't you give it with your u&s;ual caution? Can't you give it, as I put it, as to a <HI>neighbour,</HI> as to a <HI>well wi&s;her,</HI> and &s;o-forth, not as to a Lover!</P>
<P>Well then, Mr. Greville, as a <HI>neighbour,</HI> as a <HI>well|wi&s;her;</HI> and &s;ince you own it was inconvenient to your affairs to come up&mdash;I advi&s;e you to go down again.</P>
<P>The devil! how you have hit it! Your delicacy ought to thank me for the loope-hole. The condition, madam, The condition; if I take your <HI>neighbourly</HI> advice?</P>
<P>Why, Mr. Greville, I do mo&s;t &s;incerely declare to you, as to a neighbour and well-wi&s;her, that I never, <HI>yet,</HI> have &s;een the man to whom I can think of giving my hand.</P>
<P>Yes, you have! By heaven you have (&s;natching my hand): You &s;hall give it to <HI>me!</HI>&mdash;And the &s;trange wretch pre&s;&s;ed it &s;o hard to his mouth, that he made prints upon it with his teeth.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="146">
Oh! cried I, withdrawing my hand, &s;urprized, and my face, as I could feel, all in a glow.</P>
<P>And <HI>Oh!</HI> &s;aid he, mimicking (and &s;natching my other hand, as I would have run from him) and pat|ting it, &s;peaking thro' his clo&s;ed teeth, You may be glad you have an hand le&s;t. By my &s;oul, I could eat you.</P>
<P>This was your di&s;con&s;olate, fallen-&s;pirited, Gre|ville, Lucy!</P>
<P>I ru&s;hed into the company in the next room. He followed me with an air altogether unconcerned, and begged to look at my hand; whi&s;pering to Mrs. Reeves; By Jupiter, &s;aid he, I had like to have eaten up your lovely cou&s;in. I was beginning with her hand.</P>
<P>I was more offended with this in&s;tance of his a&s;&s;ure|ance and unconcern, than with the freedom it&s;elf; becau&s;e that had the appearance of his u&s;ual gaiety with it. I thought it be&s;t, however, not to be too &s;erious upon it. But the next time he gets me by him&s;elf, he &s;hall eat up both my hands.</P>
<P>At taking leave, he hoped his mad flight had not di&s;compo&s;ed me. See, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, what you get by making an hone&s;t fellow de&s;perate!&mdash;But you in&s;i&s;t upon my leaving the town? As a <HI>neighbour,</HI> as a <HI>well-wi&s;her,</HI> you <HI>advi&s;e</HI> it, madam? Come, come, don't be afraid of &s;peaking after me, when I endea|vour to hit your cue.</P>
<P>I do <HI>advi&s;e</HI> you&mdash;</P>
<P>Conditions, remember! You know what you have declared&mdash;Angel of a woman! &s;aid he again thro' his &s;hut teeth.</P>
<P>I left him, and went up &s;tairs; glad I had got rid of him.</P>
<P>He has &s;ince &s;een Mr. Reeves, and told him, he will make me one vi&s;it more before he leaves London: And pray tell her, &s;aid he, that I have actually written to my <HI>brother-tormentor</HI> Fenwick, that I am returning to Northampton&s;hire.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="147">
I told you, that Mi&s;s Clements was with me when Sir Hargrave came la&s;t. I like her every time I &s;ee her, better than before.

<P>She has engaged me to breakfa&s;t with her to-morrow morning; when &s;he is to &s;hew me her books, needle|works, and other curio&s;ities. Shall I not fan&s;y my&s;elf in my Lucy's clo&s;et?

<P>I Have pa&s;&s;ed an agreeable two hours with Mi&s;s Clements, and am ju&s;t returned. She is extremely ingenious, and perfectly unaffected. I am told, that &s;he writes finely; and is a madame de Sevigne to her corre&s;pondents. I hope to be one of them. But &s;he has not, I find, &s;uffered her pen to run away with her needle; nor her reading to interfere with that hou&s;e|wifry which the be&s;t judges hold &s;o indi&s;pen&s;able in the character of a good woman.</P>
<P>I revere her for this, as her example may be pro|duced as one, in an&s;wer to &s;uch as object (I am afraid &s;ometimes too ju&s;tly, but I hope too generally) again&s;t learning in women. Methinks, however, I would not have learning the <HI>principal</HI> di&s;tinction of the woman I love. And yet, where talents are <HI>given,</HI> &s;hould we wi&s;h them to be either uncultivated or unacknowleged? Surely, Lucy, we may pronounce, that where no duty is neglected for the acquirement; where mode&s;ty,
<PB N="141" REF="148">
delicacy, and a teachable &s;pirit, are pre&s;erved, as characteri&s;tics of the Sex, it need not be thought a di&s;grace to be &s;uppo&s;ed to know &s;omething.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Clements is happy, as well as your Harriet, in an aunt, that loves her. She has a mother living, who is too great a &s;elf-lover, to regard any-body el&s;e as &s;he ought. She lives as far off as York, and was &s;o unnatural a parent to this good child, that her aunt was not ea&s;y till &s;he got her from her. Mrs. Wim|burn looks upon her as her daughter, and intends to leave her all &s;he is worth.</P>
<P>The old Lady was not very well; but &s;he obliged us with her agreeable company for half an hour.</P>
<P>We agreed to fall in occa&s;ionally upon each other without ceremony.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told you, that the la&s;t ma&s;ter of the young man, William Wil&s;on, having given him in writing a very good character, I have entertained him; and his fir&s;t &s;ervice was attending on me to Mi&s;s Clements.</P>
<P>Lady Betty called here in my ab&s;ence. She is, it &s;eems, very full of the dre&s;&s;es, and mine in particular: But I mu&s;t know nothing about it, as yet. We are to go to her hou&s;e to dre&s;s, and to proceed from thence in chairs. She is to take care of every-thing. You &s;hall know, my Lucy, what figure I am to make, when I know it my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The baronet al&s;o called at my cou&s;ins while I was out. He &s;aw only Mr. Reeves. He &s;taid about a quarter of an hour. He was very moody and &s;ullen, it &s;eems. Quite another man, Mr. Reeves &s;aid, than he had ever &s;een him before. Not one laugh; not one &s;mile. All that &s;ell from his lips was Yes or No; or by way of invective again&s;t the Sex. It was"The devil of a Sex." It was a cur&s;ed thing, he &s;aid, that a man could be neither happy with them, nor without them. <HI>Devil's baits</HI> was another of his com|pliments to us. He hardly mentioned my name.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="149">
Mr. Reeves at la&s;t began to rally him on his moo|dine&s;s; and plainly &s;aw, that to avoid &s;hewing more of his petulance (when he had not a right to &s;hew any) to a man of Mr. Reeves's con&s;ideration, and in his own hou&s;e, he went away the &s;ooner. His footmen and coachman, he believed, had an ill time of it; for, without rea&s;on, he cur&s;ed them, &s;wore at them, and threatened them.</P>
<P>What does the man haunt us for?&mdash;Why brings he &s;uch odious humours to Mr. Reeves's?</P>
<P>But no more of &s;uch a man, nor of any thing el&s;e till my next. Only,</P>

<P>MR. Greville took leave of us ye&s;terday evening, in order to &s;et out this morning, on his return home. He would fain have engaged me for half an hour, alone. But I would not oblige him.</P>
<P>He left London, he &s;aid, with &s;ome regret, becau&s;e of the <HI>fluttering</HI> Sir Hargrave, and the <HI>creeping</HI> Mr. Fowler: But depended upon my declaration, that I had not in <HI>either of them</HI> &s;een the man I could encou|rage. <HI>Either</HI> of them were the words he cho&s;e to u&s;e; for, in compliment to him&s;elf, he would not re|peat my very words, that I had not yet &s;een <HI>any man</HI> to whom I could give my hand. Shall I give you a few particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed between me and this very whim&s;ical man? I will.</P>
<P>He had been enquiring, he &s;aid, into the character and preten&s;ions of my <HI>bother</HI> Fowler; and intended, if he could bring Orme and him together, to make a match between them, who would out-whine the other.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="150">
<HI>Heroes,</HI> I told him, ought not to make a je&s;t of tho&s;e, who, on compari&s;on, gave them all their ad|vantages.</P>
<P>He bowed, and called him&s;elf my &s;ervant&mdash;And, with an affected laugh, Yet, madam, yet, madam, I am not afraid of tho&s;e <HI>piping</HI> men: Tho' you have compa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch <HI>watry-headed</HI> fellows, yet you have <HI>only</HI> compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Re&s;pectful Love, Mr. Greville, is not always the indication either of a weak head, or a faint heart; any more, than the contrary is of a true &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;o, madam. But yet I am not afraid of the&s;e two men.</P>
<P>You have no <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to be afraid of any-body, on my account, Mr. Greville.</P>
<P>I hope not.</P>
<P>You will find, Sir, at la&s;t, that you had better take my meaning. It is obvious enough.</P>
<P>But I have no mind to hang, drown, or pi&s;tol my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville &s;till! Yet it would be well if there were not many Mr. Greville's.</P>
<P>I take your meaning, madam. You have explained it heretofore. It is, That I am a libertine; that we have all one dialect; and that I can &s;ay nothing new, or that is worthy of your attention&mdash;There, madam! May I not be always &s;ure of your meaning, when I con&s;true it again&s;t my&s;elf?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, Sir, that my <HI>neighbour</HI> would give me leave to behave to him as to my <HI>neighbour</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>And could you, madam, &s;uppo&s;ing Love out of the que&s;tion (which it cannot be) could you, in <HI>that</HI> ca&s;e, regard me as your neighbour?</P>
<P>Why not, Sir?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e I believe you hate me; and I only want you to tell me that you do.</P>

But if you hate any one man more than another, is it not me? [I was &s;ilent] Strange, Mrs. Reeves, turning to her, that Mi&s;s Byron is not &s;u&s;ceptible either of Love or Hatred.</P>

<P>The man is out of his right mind, Mrs. Reeves. I don't choo&s;e to &s;tay in his company.</P>
<P>I would have withdrawn. He be&s;ought me to &s;tay; and &s;tood between me and the door. I was angry.</P>

<P>The&s;e are the airs, you know, Lucy, for which I u&s;ed to &s;hun him.</P>

<P>Mad!&mdash;And &s;o I am. Mad for <HI>you.</HI> I care not who knows it. Why don't you hate me? He &s;natched at my hand; but I &s;tarted back. You own that you never yet loved the man who loved you. Such is your gratitude! Say, you hate me.</P>

<P>Why <HI>then</HI> (as if I had &s;aid I did not <HI>hate</HI> him) &s;ay you love me; and I will look down with contempt upon the greate&s;t prince on earth.</P>
<P>We &s;hould have had more of this&mdash;But the rap of con&s;equence gave notice of the vi&s;it of a per&s;on of con&s;ideration. It was the baronet.</P>
<P>The devil pick his bones, &s;aid the &s;hocking Greville. I &s;hall not be civil to him.</P>
<P>He is not <HI>your</HI> gue&s;t, Mr. Greville, &s;aid I&mdash;afraid that &s;omething affronting might pa&s;s between two &s;pirits &s;o unmanageable; the one in an humour &s;o whim&s;ical, the other very likely to be moody.</P>
<P>True, true; replied he. I will be all &s;ilence and ob&s;ervation. But I hope you will not <HI>now</HI> be for retiring.</P>
<P>It would be too particular, thought I, if I am: Yet I &s;hould have been glad to do &s;o.</P>
<P>The baronet paid his re&s;pects to every one in a very &s;et and formal manner; nor di&s;tingui&s;hed me.</P>
<P>Silly, as vain! thought I: Hand&s;ome fop! to imagine thy di&s;plea&s;ure of con&s;equence to me!</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, &s;aid Sir Hargrave, the town I under&s;tand is going to lo&s;e you.</P>

<P><PB N="146" REF="153">
Very ea&s;ily, when he has u&s;ed him&s;elf to it,  Hargrave, and has &s;een abroad in greater perfecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, than you can have them here, the kind of diver&s;ions you all run after with &s;o keen an appetite.</P>
<P>In <HI>greater</HI> perfection! I que&s;tion that, Mr. Greville: And I have been abroad; tho' too early, I own, to make critical ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> may que&s;tion it, Sir Hargrave; but <HI>I</HI> don't.</P>
<P>Have we not from Italy the mo&s;t famous &s;ingers, Mr. Greville, and from thence and from France, for our money, the mo&s;t famous dancers in the world?</P>
<P>No, Sir. They &s;et too great a value in Italy, let me tell you, upon their fine&s;t voices, and upon their fine&s;t compo&s;ers too, to let them turn &s;trollers.</P>
<P>Strollers do you call them? Ha, ha, ha, hah!&mdash;<HI>Princely</HI> &s;trollers, as we reward them!&mdash;and as to compo&s;ers, have we not Handel?</P>
<P>There you &s;ay &s;omething, Sir Hargrave. But you have but one Handel in England. They have &s;everal in Italy.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible? &s;aid every one.</P>
<P>Let me die, &s;aid the baronet, with a forced laugh, if I am not ready to think that Mr. Greville has run into the fault of people of le&s;s genius than him&s;elf. He has got &s;uch a ta&s;te for foreign diver&s;ions, that he can|not think tolerably of tho&s;e of his own country, be they ever &s;o excellent.</P>
<P>Handel, Sir Hargrave, is not an Engli&s;hman. But I mu&s;t &s;ay, that of every per&s;on pre&s;ent, I lea&s;t expec|ted from Sir Hargrave Pollexfen this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>[He then returned the baronet's laugh, and not without an air of mingled anger and contempt.]</P>
<P>Nor I this ta&s;te for foreign performances and com|po&s;itions from Mr. Greville; for &s;o long time as thou ha&s;t been a downright country gentleman.</P>
<P>[Indeed, thought I to my&s;elf, you &s;eem both to have changed characters. But I know how it comes about: Let one advance what he will, in the pre&s;ent humour

of both, the other will contradict it. Mr. Greville knows nothing of mu&s;ic: What he &s;aid was from hear&s;ay: And Sir Hargrave is no better grounded in it.]</P>
<P>A <HI>downright country gentleman!</HI> repeated Mr. Gre|ville, mea&s;uring Sir Hargrave with his eye, and put|ting up his lip.</P>
<P>Why, pr'ythee now, Greville, thou What-&s;hall-I-call thee; thou art not offended, I hope, that we are not all of one mind; Ha, ha, ha, hah!</P>
<P>I am offended at nothing you <HI>&s;ay,</HI> Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P>Nor I at any-thing you <HI>look,</HI> my dear; Ha, ha, ha, hah!</P>
<P>Yet his looks &s;hewed as much contempt for Mr. Greville, as Mr. Greville's did for him. How ea&s;ily might the&s;e combu&s;tible &s;pirits have blown each other up! Mr. Reeves was once a little apprehen&s;ive of con|&s;equences from the airs of both.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville turned from Sir Hargrave to me: Well, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he; but as to what we were talking about.</P>
<P>This he &s;eemed to &s;ay, on purpo&s;e, as I thought by his air, to alarm the baronet.</P>
<P>I beg pardon, &s;aid Sir Hargrave; turning with a &s;tiff air to me; I beg pardon, Mi&s;s Byron, if I have intruded&mdash;</P>
<P>We were talking of indifferent things, Sir Har|grave, an&s;wered I&mdash;Mere matters of plea&s;antry.</P>
<P>I was more in <HI>earne&s;t</HI> than in <HI>je&s;t,</HI> Mi&s;s Byron, re|plied Mr. Greville.</P>
<P>We all, I believe, thought you very whim&s;ical, Mr. Greville, returned I.</P>
<P>What was &s;port to you, madam, is death to me.</P>
<P>Poor Greville! Ha, ha, ha, hah (affectedly laughed the baronet). But I know you are a joker. You are a man of wit [This a little &s;oftened Mr. Greville, who had begun to look grave upon Sir Hargrave] Come, pr'ythee, man, give thy&s;elf up to me for this night; and I will carry thee to a private concert, where none

<P>Mu&s;ic! Ay, if Mi&s;s Byron will give us a &s;ong, and accompany it with the harp&s;ichord, I will de&s;pi&s;e all other harmony.</P>
<P>Every one joined in his reque&s;t: And I was not backward to oblige them, as I thought the conver|&s;ation bore a little too rough a ca&s;t, and was not likely to take a &s;moother turn.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, who always enjoys any je&s;t that tends to reflect on our Sex, begged me to &s;ing that whim&s;ical &s;ong &s;et by Galliard, which once my uncle made me &s;ing at Selby-hou&s;e, in Mr. Greville's hearing. You were not there, Lucy, that day; and perhaps may not have the book, as Galliard is not a favourite with you.</P>

<L><HI>CHLOE,</HI> by all the pow'rs above,</L>

<L>A ro&s;e adorn'd her &s;weeter brea&s;t:</L>
<L>She on a leaf the vow impre&s;t:</L>
<L>But Zephyr, by her &s;ide at play,</L>
<L><HI>Love, vow,</HI> and <HI>leaf,</HI> blew quite away.</L>
</LG>
<P>The gentlemen were very lively on the occa&s;ion; and encored it: But I told them, That as they mu&s;t be better plea&s;ed with the je&s;t on our Sex contained in it, than they could be with the mu&s;ic, I would not, for the &s;ake of their own politene&s;s, oblige them.</P>
<P>You will favour us, however, with your <HI>Di&s;creet Lover,</HI> Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid Mr. Greville. That is a &s;ong written entirely on your own principles.</P>
<P>Well then I will give you, &s;aid I, &s;et by the &s;ame hand,</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>THE DISCREET LOVER.</HEAD>
<L>Ye fair, that would be ble&s;t in Love,</L>

<L>Let the &s;wain whom you approve,</L>
<L>Rather <HI>like</HI> you, than <HI>adore.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="149" REF="156">
Love, that ri&s;es into pa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>Soon will end in hate or &s;trife:</L>
<L>But from tender inclination,</L>
<L>Flow the <HI>la&s;ting</HI> joys of life.</L>
</LG>
<P>The&s;e two light pieces put the gentlemen into good humour, and a deal of &s;illy &s;tuff was &s;aid to me, by way of compliment, on the occa&s;ion, by Sir Hargrave and Mr. Greville; not one word of which I believed.</P>
<P>The baronet went away fir&s;t, to go to his concert. He was very cold in his behaviour to me at taking leave, as he had been all the time.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville &s;oon after left us, intending to &s;et out this morning.</P>
<P>He &s;natched my hand at going. I was afraid of a &s;econd &s;avage freedom, and would have withdrawn it.&mdash;Only one &s;igh over it, but one &s;igh. Oh&mdash;! &s;aid he, an Oh, half a yard long&mdash;and pre&s;&s;ed it with his lips&mdash;But remember, madam, you are watched: I have half a dozen &s;pies upon you; and the moment you find the man you can favour, up comes your Greville, cuts a throat, and flies his country.</P>
<P>He &s;topt at the parlour-door&mdash;One Letter, Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;Receive but one Letter from me.</P>
<P>No, Mr. Greville: But I wi&s;h you well.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hes! that, like the Bi&s;hop's ble&s;&s;ing, co&s;t you nothing. I was going to &s;ay <HI>No,</HI> for you: But you were too quick. It had been &s;ome plea&s;ure, to have denied <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> and prevented the mortification of a denial from you.</P>
<P>He went away; every one wi&s;hing him a good journey, and &s;peaking favourably of the odd creature. Mrs. Reeves, in particular, thought fit to &s;ay, that he was the mo&s;t entertaining of all my Lovers: But if &s;o, what is it they call entertaining? And what are tho&s;e <HI>others,</HI> whom they call my Lovers?</P>
<P>The man, &s;aid I, is an immoral man: And had he not got above blu&s;hes, and above being hurt by
<PB N="150" REF="157">
Love, he could not have been &s;o gay, and &s;o <HI>enter|taining,</HI> as you call it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron &s;ays true, &s;aid Mr. Reeves. I never knew a man who could make a je&s;ting matter of the pa&s;&s;ion, in the pre&s;ence of the object, &s;o very deeply in Love, as to be hurt by a di&s;appointment. There &s;its my &s;aucebox. Did I ever make a je&s;t of my Love to you, madam?</P>
<P>No indeed, Sir: Had I not thought you mo&s;t <HI>de|plorably</HI> in earne&s;t, you had not had any of my pity.</P>
<P>Why look you there, now! That's a declaration in point. Either Mr. Orme, or Mr. Fowler, mu&s;t be the happy man, Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>Indeed, neither.</P>
<P>But why? They have both good e&s;tates. They both adore you. Sir Hargrave I &s;ee you cannot have. Mr. Greville dies not for you, tho' he would be glad to live with you. Mr. Fenwick is a &s;till le&s;s eligible man, I think. Where can you be better, than with one of the two I have named?</P>
<P>You &s;peak &s;eriou&s;ly, cou&s;in: I will not an&s;wer lightly: But neither of tho&s;e gentlemen can be the man: Yet I e&s;teem them both becau&s;e they are good men.</P>
<P>Well, but don't you pity them?</P>
<P>I don't know what to &s;ay to that: You hold, that Pity is but one remove from Love: And to &s;ay I <HI>pity</HI> a man who profe&s;&s;es to love me, becau&s;e I cannot con|&s;ent to be his, carries with it, I think, an air of arro|gance, and looks as if I believed he mu&s;t be unhappy without me, when, po&s;&s;ibly, there may be hundreds of women, with any one of whom he might be more truly happy.</P>
<P>Well, this is in character from you, Mi&s;s Byron: But may I a&s;k you now, Which of the two gentlemen, Mr. Orme, or Mr. Fowler, were you obliged to have <HI>one</HI> of them, would you choo&s;e?</P>
<P>Mr. Orme, I frankly an&s;wer. Have I not told Mr. Fowler &s;o?</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="158">
Well, then, what are your objections, may I a&s;k, to Mr. Orme? He is not a di&s;agreeable man in his per&s;on. You own that you think him a good man. His &s;i&s;ter loves you; and you love her. What is your objection to Mr. Orme?</P>
<P>I don't know what to &s;ay. I hope I &s;hould perform my duty to the man to whom I &s;hall give my vows, be he who he will: But I am not in ha&s;te to marry. If a &s;ingle woman <HI>knows</HI> her own happine&s;s, &s;he will find that the time from eighteen to twenty-four is the hap|pie&s;t part of her life. If &s;he &s;tay till &s;he <HI>is</HI> twenty-four, &s;he has time to look about her, and if &s;he has more Lovers than one, is enabled to choo&s;e without having rea&s;on, on looking back, to reproach her&s;elf for ha&s;tine&s;s. Her fluttering, her romantic age (we all know &s;omething of it, I doubt) is over by twenty-four, or it will hold too long; and &s;he is then fit to take her re&s;olutions, and to &s;ettle. I have more than once hinted, that I &s;hould be afraid to engage with one who thinks <HI>too highly</HI> of me beforehand. Nothing violent can be la&s;ting, and I could not bear, when I had given a man my heart with my hand (and they never &s;hall be &s;eparated) that he &s;hould behave to me with le&s;s affection than he &s;hewed to me before I was his. As I wi&s;h not <HI>now</HI> to be made an idol of, I may the more rea&s;onably expect the con&s;tancy due to friend|&s;hip, and not to be affronted with his indifference after I have given him my whole &s;elf. In other words, I could not bear to have my Love &s;lighted; or to be de&s;pi&s;ed for it, in&s;tead of being encouraged to &s;hew it. And how &s;hall extravagant pa&s;&s;ion warrant hopes of this nature&mdash;if the man be not a man of gratitude, of principle, and a man who&s;e Love is founded in rea&s;on, and who&s;e object is <HI>mind,</HI> rather than <HI>per&s;on?</HI></P>
<P>But Mr. Orme, replied Mr. Reeves, is all this. <HI>Such,</HI> I believe, in his Love.</P>
<P>Be it &s;o. But if I cannot love him &s;o well as to wi&s;h to be his (a man, I have heard my uncle&punc; as
<PB N="152" REF="159">
well as Sir Hargrave, &s;ay, is <HI>his own;</HI> a woman is a <HI>man's);</HI> if I cannot take delight in the thought of bearing my part of the yoke with him; in the belief, that, in ca&s;e of a contrariety of &s;entiments, I cannot give up <HI>my</HI> judgment, in points indifferent, from the good opinion I have of <HI>his;</HI> what, but a fondne&s;s for the &s;tate, and an irk&s;omene&s;s in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, could bya&s;s me in favour of <HI>any</HI> man? Indeed, my cou&s;in, I mu&s;t love the man to whom I could give my hand, well enough to be able, on cool deliberation, to <HI>wi&s;h</HI> to be his wife; and for <HI>his</HI> &s;ake (with my whole heart) choo&s;e to quit the &s;ingle &s;tate, in which I am very happy.</P>
<P>And you are &s;ure that your indifference to Mr. Orme is not either directly or indirectly owing to his ob&s;equious Love of you; and to the <HI>milkine&s;s of his nature,</HI> as Shake&s;peare calls it?</P>
<P><HI>Very,</HI> &s;ure! All the leaning towards him that I have in preference, as I think, to every other man who has beheld me with partiality, is, on the contrary, owing to the grateful &s;en&s;e I have of his re&s;pect to me, and to the gentlene&s;s of his nature. Does not my behaviour to Mr. Greville, to Mr. Fenwick, to Sir Hargrave, compared with my treatment of Mr. Orme and Mr. Fowler, confirm what I &s;ay?</P>
<P>Then you are, as indeed, I have always thought you, a non&s;uch of a woman.</P>
<P>Not &s;o; your own Lady, whom you fir&s;t brought to pity you, as I have heard you &s;ay, is an in&s;tance that I am not.</P>
<P>Well, that's true: But is &s;he not, at the &s;ame time, an example, that pity <HI>melts the &s;oul to Love?</HI></P>
<P>I have no doubt, &s;aid Mrs. Reeves, but Mi&s;s Byron may be brought to love the man &s;he can pity.</P>
<P>But, madam, &s;aid I, did you not let pity grow into Love before you married Mr. Reeves?</P>
<P>I believe I did; &s;miling.</P>
<P>Well then I promi&s;e you, Mr. Reeves, when that
<PB N="153" REF="160">
comes to be the ca&s;e with me, I will not give pain to a man I can like to marry.</P>
<P>Very well, replied Mr. Reeves: And I dare &s;ay, that at la&s;t Mr. Orme will be the man. And yet how you will get off with Sir Hargrave, I cannot tell. For Lady Betty Williams, this very day, told me, That he declared to her, he was re&s;olved you &s;hould be his. And &s;he has promi&s;ed him all her intere&s;t with you, and with us; and is a&s;toni&s;hed that you can refu&s;e a man of his fortune and addre&s;s, and who has many, very many, admirers, among people of the fir&s;t rank.</P>

<P>SIR Hargrave is ju&s;t gone. He de&s;ired to talk with me alone. I thought I might very well decline oblige|ing him, as he had never &s;crupled to &s;ay to me all he had a mind to &s;ay before my cou&s;ins; and as he had thought him&s;elf of con&s;equence enough to behave moodily; and even made <HI>this</HI> reque&s;t rather with an air of expectation, than of re&s;pect; and I accordingly de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. He &s;talked about. My cou&s;ins, fir&s;t one, then the other, withdrew. His behaviour had not been &s;o agreeable, as to de&s;erve this compli|ance: I was vexed they did.</P>
<P>He offered, as &s;oon as they were gone, to take my hand.</P>
<P>I withdrew it.</P>
<P>Madam (&s;aid he, very impertinently angry) you would not do thus to Mr. Greville: You would not do thus to <HI>any</HI> man but me.</P>

<P>You &s;ee, madam, that I cannot forbear vi&s;iting you. My heart and &s;oul are devoted to you. I own I have pride. Forgive me; it is piqued.

<P>No hope can I give you, Sir. It would be cheating, it would be deluding you, it would not be hone&s;t, to give you hope.</P>
<P>You objected to my morals, madam: Have you any other objection?</P>
<P>Need there any other?</P>
<P>But I can clear my&s;elf.</P>
<P>To God, and to your con&s;cience, then do it, Sir: I want you not to clear your&s;elf to me.</P>
<P>But, madam, the clearing my&s;elf to you, would be clearing my&s;elf to God, and my con&s;cience.</P>
<P>What language is this, Sir? But you can be no|thing to me: Indeed you can be nothing to me&mdash;Ri&s;e, Sir, ri&s;e; or I leave you.</P>
<P>I made an effort to go. He caught my hand; and aro&s;e&mdash;Then ki&s;&s;ed it, and held it between both his.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, Sir Hargrave&mdash;</P>
<P>Your objections? I in&s;i&s;t upon knowing your ob|jections. My <HI>per&s;on,</HI> madam&mdash;Forgive me, I am not u&s;ed to boa&s;t&mdash;My <HI>per&s;on,</HI> madam&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Pray,</HI> Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P>&mdash;Is not contemptible. My <HI>fortune</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you, Sir, with your fortune.</P>
<P>&mdash;Is not incon&s;iderable. My <HI>morals</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Pray,</HI> Sir Hargrave! Why this enumeration to me?</P>
<P>&mdash;Are as unexceptionable as tho&s;e of mo&s;t young men of fa&s;hion in the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>[I am &s;orry if this be true, thought I to my&s;elf.]</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="163">
You have rea&s;on I hope, Sir, to be glad of that.</P>
<P>My <HI>de&s;cent</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Is honourable, Sir, no doubt.</P>
<P>My <HI>temper</HI> is not bad. I am thought to be a man of vivacity, and of chearfulne&s;s.&mdash;I have <HI>courage,</HI> ma|dam&mdash;And this &s;hould have been &s;een, had I found rea&s;on to dread a competitor in your favour.</P>
<P>I thought you were enumerating your <HI>good</HI> qualities, Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P>Courage, madam, magnanimity in a man ma|dam&mdash;</P>
<P>Are great qualities, Sir. Courage in a right cau&s;e, I mean. Magnanimity, you know, Sir, is greatne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>And &s;o it is; and I hope&mdash;</P>
<P>And I, Sir Hargrave, hope you have great rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with <HI>your</HI>-&s;elf. But it would be very grievous to me, if I had not the liberty &s;o to act, &s;o to govern my&s;elf, in e&s;&s;ential points, as &s;hould leave me as well &s;atisfied with <HI>my</HI>-&s;elf.</P>
<P>This, I hope, <HI>may</HI> be the ca&s;e, madam, if you encourage my pa&s;&s;ion: And let me a&s;&s;ure you, that no man breathing ever loved a woman as I love you. My <HI>per&s;on,</HI> my <HI>fortune,</HI> my <HI>morals,</HI> my <HI>de&s;cent</HI> my <HI>temper</HI> (a man in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this may be allowed to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice) all unexceptionable; let me die if I can account for your&mdash;your&mdash;your refu&s;al of me in &s;o peremptory, in &s;o unceremonious a manner, &s;lap-da&s;h, as I may &s;ay, and not one objection to make, or which you will conde&s;cend to make!</P>
<P>You &s;ay, Sir, that you love me above all women: Would you, <HI>can</HI> you be &s;o little nice, as to wi&s;h to marry a woman who does not prefer you to all men?&mdash;If you <HI>are,</HI> let me tell you, Sir, that you have a&s;&s;igned a rea&s;on again&s;t your&s;elf, which I think I ought to look upon as conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>I make no doubt, madam, that my behaviour to you after marriage, will induce you in gratitude as well as ju&s;tice, to prefer me to all men.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="164">
Your behaviour <HI>after</HI> marriage, Sir!&mdash;Never will I tru&s;t to that, where&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Where</HI> what, madam?</P>
<P>No need of entering into particulars, Sir. You &s;ee that we cannot be of the &s;ame mind. You, Sir Hargrave, have no doubt of your <HI>merit</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I know, madam, that I &s;hould make it the bu&s;ine&s;s as well as plea&s;ure of my life, to de&s;erve you.</P>
<P>You value your&s;elf upon your <HI>fortune,</HI> Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Only, as it gives me power to make you happy.</P>
<P>Riches never yet, of them&s;elves, made any-body happy. I have already as great a fortune as I wi&s;h for. You think your&s;elf <HI>polite</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Polite, madam!&mdash;And I hope&mdash;</P>
<P>The whole of what I mean, Sir Hargrave, is this: You have a very high opinion of your&s;elf: You may have rea&s;on for it; &s;ince you mu&s;t know your&s;elf, and your own heart, better than I can pretend to do. But would you, let me a&s;k you, make choice of a wo|man for a wi&s;e, who frankly owns, that &s;he cannot think &s;o highly, as you imagine &s;he <HI>ought</HI> to think of you?&mdash;In ju&s;tice to your&s;elf, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>By my Soul, madam, haughtily, you are the only woman who could thus&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, Sir, perhaps I am. But will not this &s;ingu|larity convince you, that I can never make you happy, nor you me? You tell me, that you think highly of me; but if I cannot think &s;o highly of you, pray, Sir, let me be intitled to the &s;ame freedom in my refu&s;al that governs you in your choice.</P>
<P>He walked about the room; and gave him&s;elf airs that &s;hewed greater inward than even outward emo|tion.</P>
<P>I had a mind to leave him; yet was not willing to withdraw abruptly, intending, and hoping, to put an end to all his expectations for the future. I therefore in a manner a&s;ked for leave to withdraw.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, Sir, that nothing remains to be &s;aid but
<PB N="158" REF="165">
what may be &s;aid before my cou&s;ins. And, courte|&s;ying, was going.</P>
<P>He told me, with a pa&s;&s;ionate air, that he was half|di&s;tracted; and complained of the u&s;e I made of the power I had over him. And as I had near opened the door, he threw him&s;elf on his knees to me again&s;t it, and unde&s;ignedly hurt my finger with the lock.</P>
<P>He was grieved. I made light of it, tho' in pain, that he might not have an opportunity to flouri&s;h upon it, and to &s;hew a tenderne&s;s which I doubt is not very natural to him.</P>
<P>How little was I affected with <HI>his</HI> kneeling, to what I was with the &s;ame po&s;ture in Sir Rowland! Sir Har|grave &s;upplicated me as before. I was forced, in an&s;wer, to repeat &s;ome of the &s;ame things that I had &s;aid before.</P>
<P>I would fain have parted civilly. He would not permit me to do &s;o. Though he was on his knees, he mingled pa&s;&s;ion, and even indirect menaces, with his &s;upplications. I was forced to declare, that I never more would receive his vi&s;its.</P>
<P>This declaration he vowed would make him de|&s;perate, and he cared not what became of him.</P>
<P>I often begged him to ri&s;e; but to no purpo&s;e, till I declared that I would &s;tay no longer with him: And then he aro&s;e, rapt out an oath or two; again called me proud and ungrateful; and followed me into the other room to my cou&s;ins. He could hardly be civil to them: he walked two or three turns about the room: At la&s;t, Forgive me, Mr. Reeves: Forgive me, Mrs. Reeves, &s;aid he, bowing to them; more &s;tiffly to me&mdash;And you <HI>forbid</HI> my future vi&s;its, madam, &s;aid he, with a face of malice.</P>
<P>I do, Sir; and that for both our &s;akes. You have greatly di&s;compo&s;ed me.</P>
<P>Next time, madam, I have the honour of attend|ing you, it will be, I hope&mdash;[He &s;topt a moment, but &s;till looking fiercely] to an happier purpo&s;e. And away he went.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166">
Mr. Reeves was offended with him, and di&s;couraged me not in my re&s;olution to avoid receiving his future vi&s;its. You will now, therefore, hear very little farther in my Letters of this Sir Hargrave Pollexfen.</P>
<P>And yet I wi&s;h I do not &s;ee him very &s;oon. But it will be in company enough, if I do: At the Ma&s;que|rade, I mean, to-morrow night; for he never mi&s;&s;es going to &s;uch entertainments.</P>
<P>OUR dre&s;&s;es are ready. Mr. Reeves is to be an Hermit; Mrs. Reeves a Nun; Lady Betty a Lady Abbe&s;s: But I by no means like mine, becau&s;e of its gaudine&s;s: The very <HI>thing</HI> I was afraid of.</P>
<P>They call it the dre&s;s of an Arcadian Prince&s;s: But it falls not in with any of my notions of the Pa&s;toral dre&s;s of Arcadia.</P>
<P>A white Paris net &s;ort of cap, glittering with &s;pan|gles, and incircled by a chaplet of artificial flowers, with a little white feather perking from the left ear, is to be my head-dre&s;s.</P>
<P>My ma&s;que is Venetian.</P>
<P>My hair is to be complimented with an appearance, becau&s;e of its natural ringlets, as they call my curls, and to &s;hade my neck.</P>
<P>Tucker and ruffles blond lace.</P>
<P>My &s;hape is al&s;o &s;aid to be con&s;ulted in this dre&s;s. A kind of wai&s;tcoat of blue &s;atten trimmed with &s;ilver Point d'E&s;pagne, the &s;kirts edged with &s;ilver fringe, is made to &s;it clo&s;e to my wai&s;t by double cla&s;ps, a &s;mall &s;ilver ta&s;&s;el at the ends of each cla&s;p; all &s;et off, with bugles and &s;pangles, which make a mighty glitter.</P>
<P>But I am to be allowed a kind of &s;carf of white Per&s;ian &s;ilk; which gathered at the top, is to be fa&s;tened to my &s;houlders, and to fly loo&s;e behind me.</P>
<P>Bracelets on my arms.</P>
<P>They would have given me a crook; but I would not &s;ubmit to that. It would give me, I &s;aid an air
<PB N="160" REF="167">
of confidence to aim to manage it with any tolerable freedom; and I was apprehen&s;ive, that I &s;hould not be thought to want <HI>that</HI> from the dre&s;s it&s;elf. A large Indian fan was not improper for the expected warmth of the place; and that contented me.</P>
<P>My petticoat is of blue &s;atten, trimmed and fringed as my wai&s;tcoat. I am not to have an hoop that is perceivable. They wore not hoops in Arcadia.</P>
<P>What a &s;parkling figure &s;hall I make! Had the Ball been what they call a Sub&s;cription Ball, at which peo|ple dre&s;s with more glare, than at a common one, this dre&s;s would have been more tolerable.</P>
<P>But they all &s;ay, that I &s;hall be kept in countenance by ma&s;ques as extravagant, and even more ridiculous.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, I wi&s;h the night were over. I dare &s;ay, it will be the la&s;t diver&s;ion of this kind I ever &s;hall be at; for I never had any notion of ma&s;|querades.</P>
<P>Expect particulars of all in my next. I reckon you will be impatient for them. But pray, my Lucy, be fanciful, as I &s;ometimes am, and let me know how you think every-thing will be beforehand; and how many Pretty-fellows you imagine, in this dre&s;s, will be &s;lain by</P>

<P>NO one, at pre&s;ent, but your&s;elf, mu&s;t &s;ee the contents of what I am going to write.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not be too much &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>But how &s;hall I tell you the news; the dreadful news?&mdash;My wife has been &s;ince three this morn|ing in violent hy&s;terics upon it.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not&mdash;But how &s;hall I &s;ay, <HI>You</HI> mu&s;t not,
<PB N="161" REF="168">
be too much affected, when <HI>we</HI> are unable to &s;upport our&s;elves?</P>
<P>O my cou&s;in Selby!&mdash;We know not what is be|come of our deare&s;t Mi&s;s Byron!</P>
<P>I will be as particular as my grief and &s;urprize will allow. There is a nece&s;&s;ity for it, as you will find.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, as I apprehend&mdash;But to particulars fir&s;t.</P>
<P>We were la&s;t night at the Ball in the Hay-market.</P>
<P>The chairmen who carried the dear creature, and who as well as <HI>our</HI> chairmen, were engaged for the night, were inveigled away to drink &s;omewhere. They promi&s;ed Wil&s;on, my cou&s;in's &s;ervant, to re|turn in half an hour.</P>
<P>It was then but little more than twelve.</P>
<P>Wil&s;on waited near two hours, and they not re|turning, he hired a chair to &s;upply their place.</P>
<P>Between two and three, we all agreed to go home. The dear creature was fatigued with the notice every-body took of her. Every-body admired her. She wanted to go before; but Lady Betty prevailed on her to &s;tay a little longer.</P>
<P>I waited on her to her chair, and &s;aw her in it be|fore I attended Lady Betty and my wife to theirs.</P>
<P>I &s;aw that neither the chair, nor the chairmen, were tho&s;e who brought her. I a&s;k'd the meaning; and receiv'd the above particulars after &s;he was in the chair.</P>
<P>She hurried into it becau&s;e of her dre&s;s, and being warm; and no le&s;s than four gentlemen following her to the very chair.</P>
<P>It was then near three.</P>
<P>I order'd Wil&s;on to bid the chairmen &s;top when they had got out of the croud, till Lady Betty's chair, and mine, and my wife's, joined them.</P>
<P>I &s;aw her chair move, and Wil&s;on with his lighted &s;lambeaux before it; and the four ma&s;ques who fol|low'd her to the chair return into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="169">
When our &s;ervants could not find that her chair had &s;topt, we &s;uppo&s;ed that in the hurry, the fellow heard not my orders; and directed our chairmen to pro|ceed; not doubting but we &s;hould find her got home before us.</P>
<P>We had before agreed to be carried directly home; declining Lady Betty's invitation to re&s;ume our own dre&s;&s;es at her hou&s;e, where we dre&s;&s;ed for the Ball.</P>
<P>We were very much &s;urpri&s;ed at finding her not arrived: But concluding that, by mi&s;take, &s;he was carried to Lady Betty's, and was there expecting us, we &s;ent thither immediately.</P>
<P>But, good God! what was our con&s;ternation, when the &s;ervants brought us word back, that Lady Betty had not either &s;een or heard of her!</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, as I apprehend&mdash;</P>
<P>But let me give you all the lights on which I ground my &s;urmi&s;es.</P>
<P>La&s;t night Lady Betty Williams had an hint given her, as &s;he informed me at the Ma&s;querade, that Mr. Greville, who took leave of my cou&s;in on Tue&s;day evening in order to &s;et out for Northampton&s;hire the next morning, was neither gone, nor intended to go; being, on the contrary, re&s;olved to continue in town perdue, in order to watch my cou&s;in's vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>He had indeed told her, that &s;he would have half a dozen &s;pies upon her; and threw out &s;ome hints of jealou&s;y of two of her vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave Pollexfen in an Harlequin dre&s;s was at the Ball: He &s;oon di&s;cover'd our lovely cou&s;in, and, notwith&s;tanding his former ill-nature on being reject|ed by her, addre&s;&s;ed her with the politene&s;s of a man accu&s;tomed to public places.</P>
<P>He found me out at the &s;ide-board a little before we went off; and a&s;k'd me, if I had not &s;een Mr. Greville there? I &s;aid, No.</P>
<P>He a&s;k'd me, If I had not ob&s;erved a ma&s;k di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a broad-brim'd half-&s;louched hat, with a
<PB N="163" REF="170">
high flat crown, a &s;hort black cloak, a dark lantern in his hand, holding it up to every one's ma&s;que; and who, he &s;aid, was &s;aluted by every-body as Guido Vaux? That per&s;on he &s;aid was Mr. Greville.</P>
<P>I did indeed ob&s;erve this per&s;on; but recollected not, that he had the air of Mr. Greville; but thought him a much more bulky man. But that, as he in|tended to have it &s;uppo&s;ed he had left the town, might be ea&s;ily managed.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, you know, is a man of enterprize.</P>
<P>He came to town, having profe&s;&s;edly no other ma|terial bu&s;ine&s;s but to give ob&s;truction to my cou&s;in's vi&s;itors. He &s;aw &s;he had two new ones. He talk'd at fir&s;t of &s;taying in town, and partaking of its diver|&s;ions, and even of be&s;peaking a new equipage.</P>
<P>But all of a &s;udden, tho' expecting Mr. Fenwick would come up, he pretended to leave the town, and to &s;et out directly for Northampton&s;hire, without hav|ing obtained any conce&s;&s;ion from my cou&s;in in his favour.</P>
<P>Laying all the&s;e circum&s;tances together, I think it is hardly to be doubted, but Mr. Greville is at the bottom of this black affair.</P>
<P>You will therefore take &s;uch &s;teps on the&s;e lights as your prudence will &s;ugge&s;t to you. If Mr. Greville is not come down&mdash;If Mr. Fenwick&mdash;What would I &s;ay?</P>
<P>The le&s;s noi&s;e, however, the affair makes, till we can come at certainty, the better.</P>
<P>How I dread what that certainty may be!&mdash;Dear creature!</P>
<P>But I am &s;ure you will think it advi&s;eable to keep this dreadful affair from her poor grandmother. And I hope your good lady&mdash;Yet <HI>her</HI> prudent advice may be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I have &s;ix people out at different parts of the town, who are to make enquiries among chairmen, coach|men, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="171">
Her new &s;ervant cannot be a villain&mdash;What can one &s;ay?&mdash;What can one think?</P>
<P>We have &s;ent to his &s;i&s;ter, who keeps an inn in Smithfield. She has heard nothing of him.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent after the chairmen who carried her to this cur&s;ed Ma&s;querade. Lady Betty's chairmen, who had provided the chairs, know them, and their number. They are traced with a fare from White's to Berkeley-&s;quare.</P>
<P>Something may be di&s;covered by means of tho&s;e fellows, if they were tamper'd with. They are afraid, I &s;uppo&s;e, to come to demand their but half-earned money. Woe be to them if they come out to be ra&s;cals!</P>
<P>I had half a &s;u&s;picion of Sir Hargrave, as well from the character given us of him by a friend of mine, as becau&s;e of his unpolite behaviour to the dear creature on her rejecting him: And &s;ent to his hou&s;e in Ca|vendi&s;h-&s;quare, to know if he were at home; and if he were, at what time he returned from the Ball.</P>
<P>An&s;wer was brought, that he was in bed, and they &s;uppo&s;ed would not be &s;tirring till dinner-time; when he expected company: And that he returned not from the Ball till between four and five this morning.</P>
<P>We &s;ent to Mr. Greville's lodgings. He has actually di&s;charged them; and the people think (as he told them &s;o) that he is &s;et out for the country. But he is ma&s;ter of contrivances enough to manage this. There can be no thought that he would give out otherwi&s;e to them, than he did to us. Happy! had we &s;ound him not gone.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be the man!</P>
<P>You will be &s;o good, as to di&s;patch the bearer in|&s;tantly with what information can be got about Mr. Greville.</P>

<P>O Mr. Reeves!&mdash;Dear &s;weet child!&mdash;Flower of the world!&mdash;</P>
<P>But how could I keep &s;uch dreadful tidings within my own brea&s;t?&mdash;</P>
<P>How could I conceal my con&s;ternation!&mdash;My wife &s;aw it. She would know the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I could not tell her the fatal news&mdash;Fatal news in|deed! It will be immediate death to her poor grand|mother&mdash;</P>
<P>We mu&s;t keep it from her as long as we can!&mdash;But <HI>keep</HI> it from her!&mdash;And <HI>is</HI> the deare&s;t creature &s;pirited away?&mdash;O Mr. Reeves!&mdash;</P>
<P>I gave my wife your letter. She fainted away, before &s;he had read it thro'.</P>
<P>Ma&s;querades, I have generally heard &s;aid, were more &s;illy than wicked: But they are now, I am con|vinced, the mo&s;t profligate of all diver&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Almo&s;t</HI> di&s;tracted, cou&s;in!&mdash;You may <HI>well</HI> be &s;o: We &s;hall all be <HI>quite</HI> di&s;tracted&mdash;Dear, dear creature! What may &s;he not have &s;uffered by this time?</P>
<P>Why parted we with &s;uch a Jewel out of your &s;ight!</P>
<P>You <HI>would</HI> not be denied: You <HI>would</HI> have her to that cur&s;ed town.</P>
<P>Some damn'd villain, to be &s;ure!&mdash;Greville it is not.</P>
<P>Greville was &s;een late la&s;t night, alighting at his own hou&s;e from a po&s;t-chai&s;e. He had no-body with him.</P>
<P>In half an hour, late as it was, he &s;ent his com|pliments to us to let us know that he had left the dear child well, and (in his u&s;ual &s;tile) happier than &s;he would make him. He knows that our lives are bound up in hers.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="173">
Find out where &s;he is: And find her &s;afe and well: Or we will never forgive tho&s;e who were the cau&s;e of her going to London.</P>

<P>The &s;weete&s;t, obliging creature!&mdash;What is now become of her!&mdash;What by this time may &s;he not have &s;uffered!&mdash;</P>

<P>GREVILLE was this moment here.</P>
<P>We could not &s;ee him. We did not let him know the matter.</P>
<P>He is gone away, in great &s;urprize, on the &s;ervants telling him that we had received &s;ome bad news, which made us unfit to &s;ee any-body. The &s;ervants could not tell him what: Yet they all gue&s;s by your livery, and by our grief, that &s;omething has befallen their beloved young lady.

<HEAD>LETTER XXV. Mr. <HI>REEVES,</HI> To <HI>GEORGE SELBY,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> In Continuation of Letter XXIII.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>LADY Betty's chairmen have found out the fir&s;t chairmen.</P>
<P>The fellows were made almo&s;t dead drunk. They are &s;ure &s;omething was put into their liquor. They have been hunting after the footmen, who enticed them, and drank them down. They de&s;cribe their livery to be brown, trimmed and turned up with yellow; and are in the &s;ervice of a merchant's relict, who lives either in Mark-lane, or Mincing-lane; they forgot which; but have not yet been able to find them out. Their lady, they &s;aid, was at the Ma&s;querade. They were very officious to &s;crape acquaintance with them. We know not any-body who gives this livery: So no lights can be obtained by this part of the infor|mation. A cur&s;ed deep-laid villainy&mdash;The fellows are re&s;olved, they &s;ay, to find out the&s;e footmen, if above-ground; and the chairmen who were hired on their failure.</P>
<P>Every hour we have one me&s;&s;enger or other return|ing with &s;omething to &s;ay; but hitherto with nothing to the purpo&s;e. This has kept me within. O Mr. Selby, I know not what to direct! I know not what to do! I &s;end them out again as fa&s;t as they return: Yet rather &s;hew my de&s;pair, than my hope.</P>
<P>Surely this villainy mu&s;t be Mr. Greville's. Tho' I have but ju&s;t di&s;patched away my &s;ervant to you, I am impatient for his return.</P>
<P>I will write every hour, as any-thing offers, that I may have a letter ready to &s;end you by another man, the moment we hear any-thing. And yet I expect not to hear any thing material, but from you.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="175">
We begin to &s;u&s;pect the &s;ervant (that Wil&s;on) whom my cou&s;in &s;o lately hired. Were <HI>he</HI> clear of the mat|ter, either he or the chairmen he hired, mu&s;t have been heard of. He would have returned. They could not all three be either murdered or &s;ecreted.</P>
<P>The&s;e cur&s;ed Ma&s;querades!&mdash;Never will I&mdash;</P>
<P>O Mr. Selby! Her &s;ervant is, mu&s;t be a villain! Sarah, my dear cou&s;in's &s;ervant (My poor wife can think of nothing. She is extremely ill) Sarah took it into her head to have the &s;pecious ra&s;cal's trunk broke open. It felt light, and he had talk'd, but the night be|fore, of his &s;tock of cloaths and linen, to the other &s;er|vants. There was nothing of value found in it; not of <HI>&s;ix</HI>-pence value. The mo&s;t &s;pecious villain, if a villain. Every-body liked him. The dear creature her&s;elf was plea&s;ed with him. He knew every-thing and every-body.&mdash;Cur&s;ed be he for his adroitne&s;s and knowlege! We had made too many enquiries after a &s;ervant for her.</P>

<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from Smithfield. From the vil|lain's &s;i&s;ter. He comes out to be a villain&mdash;This Wil&s;on I mean&mdash;A practi&s;ed villain!</P>
<P>The woman &s;hook her head at the enquiry which I made, half out of breath, after what was become of him. She was afraid, &s;he &s;aid, that all was not right: But was &s;ure her brother had not robbed.</P>
<P>He had been guilty, I &s;aid, of a villainy, that was a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than robbery.</P>
<P>She was inqui&s;itive about it; and I hinted to her what it was.</P>
<P>Her brother, &s;he &s;aid, was a young man of parts and under&s;tanding, and would be glad, &s;he was &s;ure, of getting a livelihood by hone&s;t &s;ervices. It was a &s;ad thing that there &s;hould be &s;uch ma&s;ters in the world, as would put &s;ervants upon bad practices.</P>
<P>I a&s;k'd after the character of that Bagenhall, who&s;e
<PB N="169" REF="176">
&s;ervice her brother la&s;t lived in? and imprudently I threatened her brother.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir! was all the an&s;wer &s;he made, &s;haking her head.</P>
<P>I repeated my que&s;tion, Who was that Bagen|hall?&mdash;</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Sir, &s;aid &s;he. I will give no other an|&s;wer, till I hear whether my brother's life may be in danger or not. She abhorred, &s;he &s;aid, all ba&s;e practices as much as any-body could do; and &s;he was &s;orry for the Lady, and for me.</P>
<P>I then offer'd to be the making of her brother, were it po&s;&s;ible to engage him before any violence was done to the Lady. I a&s;k'd, If &s;he knew where to &s;end to him?</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he did not. She dared to &s;ay, &s;he &s;hould not hear of him for one while. Whenever he had been drawn in to a&s;&s;i&s;t in any out-of-the-way pranks [See, Mr. Selby, a practi&s;ed villain!] he kept away from her till all was blown over. Tho&s;e who would take &s;uch &s;teps, &s;he feared, would by this time have done the mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>How I raved!</P>
<P>I offered her money, a hand&s;ome &s;um, if &s;he would tell me what &s;he knew of that Begenhall, or of any of her brother's employers: But &s;he refu&s;ed to &s;ay one word more, till &s;he knew whether her brother's life were likely to be affected or not.</P>
<P>I left her, and ha&s;tened home, to enquire after what might have happened in my ab&s;ence. But will &s;oon &s;ee her again, in hopes &s;he may be wrought up|on to drop &s;ome hints, by which &s;omething may be di&s;cover'd&mdash;But all this time, What may be the fate of the dear &s;ufferer!&mdash;I cannot bear my own thoughts!</P>
<P>Lady Betty is inexpre&s;&s;ibly grieved&mdash;</P>
<P>I have di&s;patched a man and hor&s;e (God knows to what purpo&s;e) to a friend I have at Reading, to get him to enquire after the character of this Bagenhall.
<PB N="170" REF="177">
There <HI>is</HI> &s;uch a man, and he is a man of plea&s;ure, as, Sir John Alle&s;tree informs me&mdash;Accur&s;ed villain, this Wil&s;on!

<P>LADY Betty's chairmen have &s;ound out, and they brought with them, one of the fellows whom that vile Wil&s;on hired. The other was afraid to come. I have &s;ecured this fellow: Yet he &s;eems to be ingenu|ous; and I have promi&s;ed, that if he prove innocent, he &s;hall be rewarded in&s;tead of puni&s;h'd; and the two chairmen, on this promi&s;e, are gone to try to prevail upon his partner to come, were it but to relea&s;e the other, as both in&s;i&s;ted upon their innocence.</P>
<P>And now will you be impatient to know what ac|count this fellow gives.</P>
<P>O Mr. Selby! The dear, dear creature&mdash;But be|fore I can proceed, I mu&s;t recover my eyes.</P>

<P>THIS fellow's name is Macpher&s;on. His partner's Mc Dermot. This is Macpher&s;on's account of the matter.</P>
<P>Wil&s;on hired them to carry this young Lady to Pad|dington&mdash;To Paddington! A vile dog!&mdash;</P>
<P>They objected di&s;tance and danger; the latter, as Macpher&s;on owns, to highten the value of the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As to the danger, Wil&s;on told him, they would be met by three others of his fellow-&s;ervants, armed, at the fir&s;t fields: And as to the di&s;tance, they would be richl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> rewarded; and he gave them a crown a piece earne&s;t, and treated them be&s;ides with brandy.</P>
<P>To prevent their curio&s;ity, and entirely to remove their difficulties, the villain told them, that his young Lady was an heire&s;s, and had agreed to go off from the Ma&s;querade with her lover: But that the gentle|man
<PB N="171" REF="178">
would not appear to them till &s;he came to the very hou&s;e, to which &s;he was to be conveyed.</P>
<P>She thinks, &s;aid the helli&s;h villain, that &s;he is to be carried to May-Fair Chapel, and to be married di|rectly; and that the mini&s;ter (un&s;ea&s;onable as the hour is) will be there in readine&s;s. But the gentleman, who is a man of the utmo&s;t honour, intends fir&s;t to try whether he cannot obtain her friend's con&s;ent. So when &s;he finds her way lengthened, proceeded the vile wretch, &s;he will perhaps be frightned, and will a&s;k me que&s;tions. I would not for the world di&s;oblige her; but here &s;he mu&s;t be cheated for her own &s;ake; and when all is over, will value me the more for the inno|cent impo&s;ture. But whatever orders &s;he may give you, ob&s;erve none but mine, and follow me. You &s;hall be richly rewarded, repeated the mi&s;creant. Should &s;he even cry out, mind it not: She is full of fears, and hardly holds in one mind for an hour to|gether.</P>
<P>He further cautioned them not to an&s;wer any que|&s;tions which might po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;k'd of them, by the per&s;on who &s;hould conduct his young Lady to her chair; but refer to him&s;elf: And in ca&s;e any other chairs were to go in company with hers, he bid them fall behind, and follow his flambeaux.</P>
<P>Macpher&s;on &s;ays, that &s;he drew the curtains clo&s;e (becau&s;e of her dre&s;s, no doubt) the moment I had le&s;t her, after &s;eeing her in the chair.</P>
<P>The fellows thus prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and in&s;tructed, &s;peed|ed away, without &s;topping for our chairs. Yet the dear creature mu&s;t have heard me give that direction.</P>
<P>They had carried her a great way before &s;he called out; and <HI>then</HI> &s;he called three times before they would hear her: At the third time they &s;topt, and her &s;er|vant a&s;ked her commands. Where am I, William, &s;aid &s;he? Ju&s;t at home, madam, an&s;wered he. Surely you have taken a &s;trange round-about way. We <HI>are</HI>
<PB N="172" REF="179">
come about, &s;aid the ra&s;cal, on purpo&s;e to avoid the croud of chairs and coaches.</P>
<P>They proceeded onwards, and were joined by three men, as Wil&s;on had told them they would; but they fan&s;ied one of them to be a gentleman; for he was muffled up in a cloak, and had a &s;ilver-hilted &s;word in his hand: But he &s;poke not: He gave no directions: And all three kept aloof, that they might not be &s;een by her.</P>
<P>At Maribone, &s;he again called out; William, Wil|liam, &s;aid &s;he, with vehemence: The Lord have mercy upon me! Where are you going to carry me? Chairmen, &s;top! Stop, chairmen! Set me down!&mdash;William!&mdash;Call my &s;ervant, chairmen!&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear &s;oul! Her &s;ervant! Her devil!</P>
<P>The chairmen called him. They lifted up the head. The &s;ide-curtains were &s;till undrawn, and M^c.Dermot &s;tood &s;o clo&s;e, that &s;he could not &s;ee far before her. Did you not tell me, &s;aid the villain to them, that it was not far about?&mdash;See how you have frighted my Lady!&mdash;Madam, we are now almo&s;t at home.</P>
<P>They proceeded with her, &s;aying, they had indeed mi&s;taken their way; but they were ju&s;t there; and hurried on.</P>
<P>She then undrew the &s;ide-curtains&mdash;Good God of heaven protect me! they heard her &s;ay&mdash;I am in the mid&s;t of fields&mdash;They were then at Li&s;&s;om-Green.</P>
<P>They heard her pray; and Macpher&s;on &s;aid, He be|gan then to conclude, that the Lady was too much frighten'd, and <HI>too pious,</HI> to be in a love-plot.</P>
<P>But, neverthele&s;s, backoned by their villainous guide, they hurried on: And then &s;he &s;creamed out, and happening to &s;ee one of the three men, &s;he begg'd his help for God's &s;ake.</P>
<P>The fellow blu&s;tered at the chairmen, and bid them &s;top. She a&s;ked for Gro&s;venor-&s;treet. She was to be carried, &s;he &s;aid, to Gro&s;venor-&s;treet.</P>
<P>She was ju&s;t there, that fellow &s;aid&mdash;It can't be,
<PB N="173" REF="180">
Sir! It can't be!&mdash;Don't I &s;ee fields all about me?&mdash;I am in the mid&s;t of fields, Sir.</P>
<P>Gro&s;venor-Square, madam, reply'd that villain; the trees and garden of Gro&s;venor-Square.</P>
<P>What a &s;trange way have you come about, cry'd her mi&s;creant! And then trod out his flambeaux; while another fellow took the chairmens lantern from them; and they had only a little glimmering &s;tar-light to guide them.</P>
<P>She then, poor dear &s;oul! &s;creamed &s;o di&s;mally, that Macpher&s;on &s;aid, it went to his heart to hear her. But they followed Wil&s;on, who told them they were ju&s;t <HI>landed,</HI> that was his word, he led them up a long garden-walk, by a back-way. One of the three men having got before, opened the garden-door, and held it in his hand; and by the time they got to the hou&s;e to which the garden &s;eemed to belong, the dear crea|ture cea&s;ed &s;creaming.</P>
<P>They too well &s;aw the cau&s;e, when they &s;topt with her. She was in a fit.</P>
<P>Two women, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the per&s;on in the cloak, helped her out, with great &s;eeming tenderne&s;s. They &s;aid &s;omething in prai&s;e of her beauty, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves concerned for her, as if they were afraid &s;he was pa&s;t recovery: Which apparently &s;tart|led the man in the cloak.</P>
<P>Wil&s;on entered the hou&s;e with tho&s;e who carried in the dear creature; but &s;oon came out to the chairmen. They &s;ay the man in the cloak (who hung about the villain, and hugg'd him, as in joy) give the ra&s;cal money; who then put a guinea into each of their hands; and conveyed them thro' the garden again, to the door at which they entered; but refu&s;ed them light even &s;o much as that of their own candle and lantern. However he &s;ent another man with them, who led them over rough and dirty by-ways into a path that pointed London-ward; but plainly &s;o much about with
<PB N="174" REF="181">
de&s;ign to make it difficult for them to find out the place again.</P>
<P>THE other fellow is brought hither: He tells ex|actly the &s;ame &s;tory</P>
<P>I a&s;k'd of both, what &s;ort of man he in the cloak was: But he &s;o carefully muffled him&s;elf up, and &s;o little appeared to them, either walking after them, or at the hou&s;e, that I could gain no light from their de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>On their promi&s;e to be forth-coming, I have &s;uf|fered them to go with Lady Betty's chairmen to try if they can trace out their own foot&s;teps, and find the place.</P>
<P>How many hopele&s;s things mu&s;t a man do, in an exigence, who knows not what is right to be done!</P>
<P>I HAVE enquired of Lady Betty, Who it was that told her, Mr. Greville was not gone out of town; but intended to lie perdue; and &s;he named her in|formant. I a&s;k'd how the di&s;cour&s;e came in? She own'd, a little aukwardly. I a&s;k'd whether that Lady knew Mr. Greville? She could not &s;ay whether &s;he did, or not.</P>
<P>I went to that Lady: Mrs. Pre&s;ton, in New Bond|&s;treet. She had her intelligence, &s;he told me, from Sir Hargrave Pollexfen; who had hinted to her, that he &s;hould take &s;uch notice of Mr. Greville, as might be attended with con&s;equences; and &s;he was the readier to intimate this to Lady Betty, in order to pre|vent mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Now, Mr. Selby, as the intimation that the dark|lantern figure at the Ma&s;querade was Mr. Greville, came from Sir Hargrave, and nobody el&s;e; and we &s;aw nothing of him our&s;elves; how do we know&mdash;And yet Mr. Greville intended that we &s;hould believe him to be out of town&mdash;Yet even that intimation came from Sir Hargrave&mdash;And furthermore, was it
<PB N="175" REF="182">
not likely that he would take as much care to conceal him&s;elf from Sir Hargrave, as from us?&mdash;But I will go in&s;tantly to Sir Hargrave's hou&s;e. He was to dine at home, and with company. If I cannot &s;ee him; If he &s;hould be ab&s;ent&mdash;But no more till I return.</P>
<P>O MR. Selby! I believe I have wrong'd Mr. Gre|ville. The dear &s;oul, I am afraid, is fallen into even wor&s;e hands than his.</P>
<P>I went to Sir Hargrave's hou&s;e. He was <HI>not</HI> at home. He <HI>was</HI> at home. He had company with him. He was not to be &s;poken with. The&s;e were the different an&s;wers given me by his porter, with as much confu&s;ion, as I had impatience; and yet it was evident to me, that he had his le&s;&s;on given him. In &s;hort, I have rea&s;on to think, that Sir Hargrave came not home all night. The man in the cloak, I doubt, was he. Now does all that Sir John Al|le&s;tree &s;aid of the malicious wickedne&s;s of this de|vili&s;h man, and his arrogant behaviour to our dear Mi&s;s Byron, on her rejecting him, come fre&s;h into my memory. And is &s;he, can &s;he be, fallen into the power of &s;uch a man?&mdash;Rather, much rather, may my fir&s;t &s;urmi&s;es prove true. Greville is &s;urely (ex|ceptionable as he is) a better man, at lea&s;t, a better-natured man, than this; and he can have no thoughts le&s;s honourable than marriage: But this villian, if he <HI>be</HI> the villian&mdash;I cannot, I dare not pur&s;ue the thought.</P>
<P>THE four chairmen are ju&s;t returned. They think they have found the place; but having gained &s;ome intelligence (intelligence which di&s;tracts me!) they hurried back for directions.</P>
<P>They had a&s;ked a neighbouring alehou&s;e-keeper, if there were not a long garden (belonging to the hou&s;e they &s;u&s;pected) and a back-door out of it to a dirty lane and fields. He an&s;wered in the affirmative. The front of this hou&s;e faces the road.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="183">
They called for &s;ome hot liquors; and a&s;ked the landlord after the owners. He knew nothing of harm of them, he &s;aid. They had lived there near a twelve|month in reputation. The family con&s;i&s;ted of a wi|dow, who&s;e name is Awberry, her &s;on and two daugh|ters. The &s;on (a man of about thirty years of age) has a place in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and only came down on a Saturday, and went up on Monday. But an odd circum&s;tance, he &s;aid, had alarmed him that very morning.</P>
<P>He was at fir&s;t a little &s;hy of telling what it was. He loved, he &s;aid, to mind his own bu&s;ine&s;s: What other people did was nothing to him: But, at la&s;t, he told them, that about &s;ix o'clock in the morning he was awaken'd by the trampling of hor&s;es; and look|ing out of his window, &s;aw a chariot-and-&s;ix, and three or four men on hor&s;eback at the widow Awber|ry's door. He got up. The footmen and coachmen were very <HI>hu&s;h,</HI> not calling for a drop of liquor, tho' his doors were open: A rare in&s;tance, he &s;aid, where there were &s;o many men-&s;ervants together, and a coachman one of them. This, he &s;aid, could not but give a greater edge to his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>About &s;even o'clock, one of the widow's daughters came to the door, with a lighted candle in her hand, and directed the chariot to drive up clo&s;e to the hou&s;e. The alehou&s;e-keeper then &s;lipt into an arbour-like porch, next door to the widow's; where he had not been three minutes before he &s;aw two per&s;ons come to the door; the one a tall gentleman in laced cloaths, who had his arms about the other, a per&s;on of mid|dling &s;tature, wrapt up in a &s;carlet cloak; and re&s;i&s;t|ing, as one in great di&s;tre&s;s, the other's violence, and begging not to be put into the chariot, in a voice and accent, that evidently &s;hewed it was a woman.</P>
<P>The gentleman made vehement prote&s;tations of honour; but lifted the Lady into the chariot. She &s;truggled, and &s;eemed to be in agonies of grief; and
<PB N="177" REF="184">
on being lifted in, and the gentleman going in after her, &s;he &s;creamed out for help; and he ob&s;erved in the &s;truggling, that &s;he had on, under her cloak, a &s;ilver|laced habit [The Ma&s;querade habit, no doubt!] Her &s;creaming grew fainter and fainter, and her voice &s;ounded to him, as if her mouth were &s;topped. And the gentleman &s;eemed to &s;peak high, as if he threat|ened her.</P>
<P>Away drove the chariot. The &s;ervants rode after it.</P>
<P>In about half an hour, a coach and four came to the widow's door; the widow and her two daughters went into it, and it took the &s;ame road.</P>
<P>The alehou&s;e-keeper had afterwards the curio&s;ity to a&s;k the maid-&s;ervant, an ignorant country wench, whither her mi&s;tre&s;&s;es went &s;o early in the morning? She an&s;wered they were gone to Wind&s;or, or that way, and would not return, &s;he believed, in a week.</P>
<P>O this damn'd Sir Hargrave! He has a hou&s;e upon the fore&s;t. I have no doubt but he is the villain. Who knows what injuries the dear creature might have &s;u&s;tained before &s;he was forced into the chariot?&mdash;God give me patience! Dear &s;oul! Her prayers! Her &s;truggling! Her crying out for help! Her mouth &s;topt!&mdash;O the villain!</P>
<P>I have ordered as many men and hor&s;es as two of my friends can furni&s;h me with, to be added to two of my own (we &s;hall be nine in all) to get ready with all &s;peed. I will pur&s;ue the villain to the world's end, but I will find him.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t cour&s;e &s;hall be to his hou&s;e at Wind&s;or. If we find him not there, we will proceed to that Ba|genhall's, near Reading.</P>
<P>It would be but le&s;ing time, were I to go now to Paddington. And when the vile widow and her daughters are gone from home, and only an ignorant wench left, what can we learn of her more than is already told to us?</P>
<P>I have, however, accepted Lady Betty's offer of her
<PB N="178" REF="185">
&s;teward's going with the two chairmen, to get what farther intelligence he can from Paddington, again&s;t my return.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take what I have written with me, to form from it a letter le&s;s hurrying, le&s;s alarming, for your peru&s;al, than this that I have written at &s;uch &s;natches of time, and under &s;uch dreadful uncertainties, would be to you, were I to &s;end it; that is to &s;ay, if I have time, and if I am able to write with any certainty&mdash;O that dreaded certainty!</P>
<P>At four in the morning the &s;ix men I borrow, and my&s;elf, and two of my &s;ervants, well armed, are to rendezvous at Hyde-Park Corner. It is grievous that another night mu&s;t pa&s;s. But &s;o many people cannot be got together as two or three might.</P>
<P>My poor wife has made me promi&s;e to take the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of peace-officers, where-ever I find either the villain, or the &s;uffering angel.</P>

<P><HI>In fits!&mdash;Has been cruelly treated!&mdash;Many hours &s;peechle&s;s!&mdash;Cannot be removed!</HI>&mdash;Her &s;olicitude, tho' hardly her&s;elf, <HI>for our ea&s;e!</HI>&mdash;Deare&s;t, dear creature!&mdash;But you will rejoice with me, my cou&s;ins, that &s;he is in &s;uch honourable hands.</P>
<P>What I have written mu&s;t now go. I have no time to tran&s;cribe.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent to my two friends to let them know, that I &s;hall not have occa&s;ion for their peoples a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>She is at a nobleman's hou&s;e, the Earl of L. near Colnebrooke.</P>
<P>My wife, hara&s;&s;ed and fatigued in mind as &s;he has been on this occa&s;ion, and poorly in health, want|ed to go with me: But it is be&s;t fir&s;t for me to &s;ee how the dear creature is.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;et out before day, on hor&s;eback. My &s;er|vant &s;hall carry with him a portmanteau of things, ordered by my wife. My cou&s;in mu&s;t have made a &s;trange appearance in her Ma&s;querade dre&s;s, to her deliverer.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t man who brought the Letter [He looks remarkably &s;o; but had he a le&s;s agreeable counte|nance, he would have been received by us as an an|gel, for his happy tidings] was but ju&s;t returned from Wind&s;or, whither he had been &s;ent early in the morn|ing, to tran&s;act &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, when he was di&s;patched
<PB N="180" REF="187">
away to us with the welcome Letter. He could not therefore be &s;o particular as we wi&s;hed him. What he gathered was from the hou&s;ekeeper; the men-&s;er|vants, who were in the fray [A fray there was!] be|ing gone to town with their ma&s;ter. But what we learnt from him, is, briefly, as follows:</P>
<P>His ma&s;ter is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; a gentleman who has not been long in England. I have often heard mention of his father, Sir Thomas, who died not long ago. This hone&s;t man knew not when to &s;top in his ma&s;ter's prai&s;e. He gives his young Lady al&s;o an excellent character.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was going to town in his chariot-and-&s;ix when he met (mo&s;t happily met!) our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave <HI>is</HI> the villain.</P>
<P>I am heartily &s;orry for &s;u&s;pecting Mr. Greville.</P>
<P>Sir Charles had earne&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s in town; and he proceeded thither, after he had re&s;cued the dear crea|ture, and committed her to the care of his &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;God for ever ble&s;s him!</P>
<P>The vile Sir Hargrave, as the &s;ervant under&s;tood, was wounded. Sir Charles it &s;eems was al&s;o hurt. Thank God it was &s;o &s;lightly, as not to hinder him from pur&s;uing his journey to town after the glorious act.</P>
<P>I would have given the hone&s;t man a hand&s;ome gratuity: But he &s;o earne&s;tly be&s;ought me to excu&s;e him, declaring that he was under an obligation to the mo&s;t generous of ma&s;ters to decline all gifts, that I was obliged to withdraw my hand.</P>
<P>I will &s;peed this away by Richard Fennell. I will &s;oon &s;end you farther particulars by the po&s;t: Not unhappy ones, I hope.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e, mean time, all that is ami&s;s in a Letter the greate&s;t part of which was written in &s;uch dreadful uncertainty, and believe, that I will be</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. Mr. <HI>REEVES,</HI> To <HI>GEORGE SELBY,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sat. Feb. 18.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from vi&s;iting my beloved cou&s;in. You will be glad of every minute particular, as I can give it to you, relating to this &s;hocking affair; and to her protector and his &s;i&s;ter. There are not &s;uch another brother and &s;i&s;ter in England.</P>
<P>I got to the ho&s;pitable man&s;ion by nine this morning. I enquired after Mi&s;s Byron's health; and, on giving in my name, was &s;hewn into a hand&s;ome parlour, elegantly furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Immediately came down to me a very agreeable young Lady; Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. I gave her a thou&s;and thanks for the honour of her Letter, and the joyful in|formation it had given me of the &s;afety of one &s;o de|&s;ervedly dear to us.</P>
<P>She <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be an excellent young Lady, an&s;wered &s;he, I have ju&s;t left her&mdash;You mu&s;t not &s;ee her yet&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah, madam, &s;aid I, and looked &s;urpri&s;ed and grieved, I believe&mdash;</P>
<P>Don't affright your&s;elf, Sir. Mi&s;s Byron will do very well. But &s;he mu&s;t be kept quiet. She has had a happy deliverance&mdash;She&mdash;</P>
<P>O madam, interrupted I, your generous, your no|ble brother&mdash;</P>
<P>Is the be&s;t of men, Mr. Reeves: His delight is in doing good.&mdash;And, as to this adventure, it has made him, I am &s;ure, a very happy man.</P>
<P>But is my cou&s;in, madam, &s;o ill, that I cannot be allowed to &s;ee her for one moment?</P>
<P>She is but ju&s;t come out of a fit. She fell into it in the relation &s;he would have made of her &s;tory, on mentioning the villain's name by whom &s;he has &s;uf|fered. She could give only broken and imperfect ac|counts
<PB N="182" REF="189">
of her&s;elf all day ye&s;terday, or you had heard from me &s;ooner. When you &s;ee her, you mu&s;t be very cautious of what you &s;ay to her. We have a &s;kilful phy&s;ician, by who&s;e advice we proceed.</P>
<P>God for ever ble&s;s you, madam!</P>
<P>He has not long left her. He advi&s;es quiet. She has had a very bad night. Could &s;he compo&s;e her&s;elf, could &s;he get a little natural re&s;t, the cure is per|formed. Have you breakfa&s;ted, Sir?</P>
<P>Breakfa&s;ted, madam! My impatience to &s;ee my cou&s;in allowed me not to think of breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t breakfa&s;t with me, Sir. And when that is over, if &s;he is tolerable, we will acquaint her with your arrival, and go up together. I read your impa|tience, Sir: We will make but a very &s;hort break|fa&s;ting. I was ju&s;t <HI>going</HI> to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>She rang. It was brought in.</P>
<P>I longed, I &s;aid, as we &s;at at tea, to be acquainted with the particulars of the happy deliverance.</P>
<P>We avoid a&s;king any que&s;tions that may affect her. I know very little of the particulars my&s;elf. My bro|ther was in ha&s;te to get to town. The &s;ervants that were with him at the time, hardly di&s;mounted: He doubted not but the Lady (to whom he referred me for the gratifying my curio&s;ity) would be able to tell me every-thing. But &s;he fell into fits, and, as I told you, was &s;o ill, on the recollection of what &s;he had &s;uffered&mdash;</P>
<P>Good God! &s;aid I, what <HI>mu&s;t</HI> the dear creature have &s;uffered!</P>
<P>&mdash;That we thought fit to re&s;train our curio&s;ity, and &s;o mu&s;t you, till we &s;ee Sir Charles. I expect him before noon.</P>
<P>I am told, madam, that there was a &s;kirmi&s;h. I hope Sir Charles&mdash;</P>
<P>I hope &s;o too, Mr. Reeves, interrupted &s;he. I long to &s;ee my brother as much as you can do to &s;ee your cou&s;in&mdash;But on my apprehen&s;ions, he a&s;&s;ured me
<PB N="183" REF="190">
upon his honour, that he was but very &s;lightly hurt. Sir Charles is no qualifier, Sir, when he &s;takes his honour, be the occa&s;ion either light or &s;erious.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I doubted not but &s;he was very much &s;ur|pri&s;ed at a Lady's being brought in by Sir Charles, and in a dre&s;s &s;o fanta&s;tic.</P>
<P>I was, Sir. I had not left my chamber: But ha&s;tened down at the fir&s;t word, to receive and wel|come the &s;tranger. My maid, out of breath, bur&s;t into my room&mdash;Sir Charles, madam, be&s;eeches you this moment to come down. He has &s;aved a Lady from robbers (that was her report) a very fine Lady! and is come back with her. He begs that you will come down this in&s;tant.</P>
<P>I was too much &s;urpri&s;ed at my brother's unexpect|ed return, and too much affected with the Lady's vi&s;i|ble grief and terror, to attend to her dre&s;s, when I fir&s;t went down. She was &s;itting, dreadfully trem|bling, and Sir Charles next her, in a very tender man|ner, a&s;&s;uring her of his and of his &s;i&s;ter's kinde&s;t pro|tection. I &s;aluted her, continued the Lady: Welcome, welcome, thrice welcome to this hou&s;e, and to me&mdash;</P>
<P>She threw her&s;elf on one knee to me. Di&s;tre&s;s had too much humbled her. Sir Charles and I rai&s;ed her to her &s;eat. You &s;ee before you, madam, &s;aid &s;he, a &s;trange creature; and looked at her dre&s;s: But I hope you will believe I am an innocent one. This vile ap|pearance was not my choice. Fie upon me! I mu&s;t be thus dre&s;&s;ed out for a Ma&s;querade: Hated diver&s;ion! I never had a notion of it. Think not hardly, Sir, turning to Sir Charles, her hands cla&s;ped and held up, of her whom you have &s;o generou&s;ly delivered. Think not hardly of me, madam, turning to me: I am not a bad creature. That vile, vile man!&mdash;She could &s;ay no more.</P>
<P>Charlotte, &s;aid my brother, you will make it your fir&s;t care to rai&s;e the &s;pirits of this injured beauty: Your next, to take her directions, and inform her
<PB N="184" REF="191">
friends of her &s;afety. Such an admirable young Lady as this, cannot be mi&s;&s;ed an hour, without exciting the fears of all her friends for her. I repeat, madam, that you are in honourable hands. My &s;i&s;ter will have plea&s;ure in obliging you.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed to be conveyed to town; but looking at her dre&s;s, I offered her cloaths of mine; and my brother &s;aid, if &s;he were very earne&s;t, and thought her&s;elf able to go, he would take hor&s;e, and leave the chariot, and he was &s;ure that I would attend her thi|ther.</P>
<P>But before &s;he could declare her acceptance of this offer, as &s;he &s;eemed joyfully ready to do, her &s;pirits failed her, and &s;he &s;unk down at my feet.</P>
<P>Sir Charles ju&s;t &s;taid to &s;ee her come to her&s;elf; and then&mdash;Si&s;ter, &s;aid he, the Lady cannot be removed. Let Dr. Holmes be &s;ent for in&s;tantly. I know you will give her your be&s;t attendance. I will be with you before noon to-morrow. The Lady is too low, and too weak, to be troubled with que&s;tions now. John&s;on will be back from Wind&s;or. Let him take her commands to any of her friends. Adieu, dear madam&mdash;[Your cou&s;in, Sir, &s;eemed likely to faint again] Support your&s;elf. Repeating, You are in &s;afe and honourable hands; bowing to her, as &s;he bowed in return: but &s;poke not&mdash;Adieu, Charlotte: And away went the be&s;t of brothers.</P>
<P>And God Almighty ble&s;s him, &s;aid I, where-ever he goes!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on then told me, that the hou&s;e I was in belonged to the Earl of L. who had lately mar|ried her elder &s;i&s;ter: About three months ago, they &s;et out, &s;he &s;aid, to pay a vi&s;it to my Lord's e&s;tate and relations in Scotland, for the fir&s;t time, and to &s;ettle &s;ome affairs there: They were expected back in a week or fortnight: She came down but la&s;t Tue&s;day, and <HI>that</HI> in order to give directions for every-thing to be prepared for their reception. It was happy for
<PB N="185" REF="192">
your cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he, that I obtained the favour of my brother's company; and that he was obliged to be in town this morning. He intended to come back to carry me to town this evening. We are a family of love, Mr. Reeves. We are true brothers and &s;i&s;ters&mdash;But why do I trouble you with the&s;e things now? We &s;hall be better acquainted. I am charmed with Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>She was &s;o good as to hurry the breakfa&s;t; and when it was over, conducted me up &s;tairs. She bid me &s;tay at the door, and &s;tept gently to the bed-&s;ide and opening the curtain, I heard the voice of our cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Dear madam, what trouble do I give! were her words.</P>
<P><HI>Still</HI> talk of trouble, Mi&s;s Byron! an&s;wered Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, with an amiable familiarity; you will not forbear&mdash;Will you promi&s;e me not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the arrival of your cou&s;in Reeves?</P>
<P>I do promi&s;e&mdash;I &s;hall rejoice to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on called to me. I approached, and catching my cou&s;in's held-out hand, Thank God, thank God, be&s;t beloved of an hundred hearts! &s;aid I, that once more I behold you! that once more I &s;ee you in &s;afe and honourable hands!&mdash;I will not tell you what we have all &s;uffered.</P>
<P>No, don't, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;You need not&mdash;But, O my cou&s;in! I have fallen into the company of angels.</P>
<P>Forbear, gently patting her hand, forbear the&s;e high flights, &s;aid the kind Lady, or I &s;hall beat my charm|ing patient. I &s;hall not think you in a way to be quite well, till you <HI>de&s;cend.</HI></P>
<P>She whi&s;pered me, that the doctor had expre&s;&s;ed fears for her head, if &s;he were not kept quiet. Then rai&s;ing her voice, Your cou&s;in's gratitude, Mr. Revees, is exce&s;&s;ive. You mu&s;t allow me, &s;miling, to beat her. When &s;he is well, &s;he &s;hall talk of angels, and of what &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="193">
But, my dear Mr. Selby, we who know how her heart overflows with &s;entiments of gratitude, on every common obligation, and even on but <HI>intentional</HI> ones, can ea&s;ily account for the high &s;en&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have of tho&s;e &s;he lies under for &s;uch a deliverance from the brother, and of &s;uch kind treatment from the &s;i&s;ter, both ab&s;olute &s;trangers, till her di&s;tre&s;&s;es threw her into their protection.</P>
<P>I will only a&s;k my dear Mi&s;s Byron <HI>one</HI> que&s;tion, &s;aid I (forgetting the caution given me below by Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on) Whether this villain, by his violence&mdash;[meant marriage, I was going to &s;ay] But interrupting me, You &s;hall not, Mr. Reeves, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;miling, a&s;k half a que&s;tion, that may revive di&s;agree|able remembrances. Is &s;he not alive, and here, and in a way to be well? Have patience till &s;he is able to tell you all.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in was going to &s;peak: My dear, &s;aid the Lady, you &s;hall not an&s;wer Mr. Reeves's que&s;tion, if it be a que&s;tion that will induce you to look backward. At pre&s;ent you mu&s;t look only forward. And are you not in my care, and in Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's pro|tection?</P>
<P>I have done, madam, &s;aid I, bowing&mdash;The de&s;ire of taking vengeance&mdash;</P>
<P>Hu&s;h, Mr. Revees!&mdash;Surely!&mdash;Smiling, and hold|ing her finger to her lip.</P>
<P>It is a patient's duty, &s;aid my cou&s;in to &s;ubmit to the pre&s;criptions of her kind phy&s;ician: But were I ever to forgive the author of my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, it mu&s;t be for his being the occa&s;ion of bringing me into the knowlege of &s;uch a Lady: And yet to lie under the weight of obligations that I never can return&mdash;Here &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>I took this as a happy indication that the la&s;t vio|lence was not offered: If it had, &s;he would not have mentioned forgiving the author of her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>As to what you &s;ay of obligation, Mi&s;s Byron, re|turned
<PB N="187" REF="194">
Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, let <HI>your</HI> heart an&s;wer for <HI>mine,</HI> had you and I changed &s;ituation. And if, on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, you can think, that your humanity would have been &s;o <HI>extraordinary</HI> a matter, then &s;hall you be at liberty, when you are recovered, to &s;ay a thou&s;and fine things: Till when, pray be &s;ilent on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Then turning to me, See how much afraid your cou&s;in Byron is of lying under obligation. I am afraid &s;he has a proud heart: Has &s;he not a <HI>very</HI> proud heart, Mr. Reeves?</P>
<P>She has a very <HI>grateful</HI> one, madam, replied I.</P>
<P>She turned to my cou&s;in: Will you, Mi&s;s Byron, be ea&s;y under the obligations you talk of, or will you not?</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit to your &s;uperiority, madam, in every-thing, replied my cou&s;in; bowing her head.</P>
<P>She then a&s;ked me, if I had let her friends in the country know of this &s;hocking affair?</P>
<P>I had &s;u&s;pected Mr. Greville, I &s;aid; and had written in confidence to her uncle Selby&mdash;</P>
<P>O my poor grandmamma&mdash;O my good aunt Selby, and my Lucy&mdash;I hope&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on interpo&s;ed, humorou&s;ly interrupt|ing&mdash;I will have nothing &s;aid that begins with <HI>O.</HI> In|deed, Mi&s;s Byron, Mr. Reeves, I will not tru&s;t you together&mdash;Cannot you have patience&mdash;</P>
<P>We both a&s;ked her pardon. My cou&s;in de&s;ired leave to ri&s;e&mdash;But the&s;e odious cloaths, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;</P>
<P>If you are well enough, child, replied Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on, you &s;hall ri&s;e, and have no need to &s;ee tho&s;e odious cloaths, as you call them. I told them Mrs. Reeves had &s;ent her &s;ome of her cloaths. The portmanteau was ordered to be brought up.</P>
<P>Then Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;itting down on the bed by my cou&s;in, took her hand; and, feeling her pul&s;e, Are you &s;ure, my patient, that you &s;hall not &s;uffer if you are permitted to ri&s;e? Will you be calm, &s;erene, ea&s;y?
<PB N="188" REF="195">
Will you bani&s;h curio&s;ity? Will you endeavour to avoid recollection?</P>
<P>I will do my endeavour, an&s;wered my cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on then rung, and a maid-&s;ervant coming up, Jenny, &s;aid &s;he, pray give your be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to my lovely patient. But be &s;ure don't let her hurry her &s;pirits. I will lead Mr. Reeves into my dre&s;&s;ing-room. And when you are dre&s;&s;ed, my dear, we will either return to you here, or expect you to join us there, at your plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>And then &s;he obligingly conducted me into her dre&s;&s;ing-room; and excu&s;ed her&s;elf for refu&s;ing to let us talk of intere&s;ting &s;ubjects. I am rejoiced, &s;aid &s;he, to find her more &s;edate and compo&s;ed than hitherto &s;he has been. Her head has been greatly in danger. Her talk, for &s;ome hours, when &s;he <HI>did</HI> talk, was &s;o wild and incoherent, and &s;he was &s;o full of terror, on every one's coming in her &s;ight, that I would not &s;uffer any-body to attend her but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I left her not, continued Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, till ele|ven; and the hou&s;ekeeper, and my maid, &s;at up in her room all the re&s;t of the night.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e before my u&s;ual time to attend her. I &s;lept not well my&s;elf. I did nothing but dream of robbers, re&s;cues, and murders: Such an impre&s;&s;ion had the di&s;tre&s;s of this young Lady made on my mind.</P>
<P>They made me a poor report, proceeded &s;he, of the night &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed. And, as I told you, &s;he fainted away this morning a little before you came, on her endeavouring to give me &s;ome account of her affecting &s;tory.</P>
<P>Let me tell you, Mr. Reeves, I am as curious as you can be, to know the whole of what has befallen her. But her heart is tender and delicate. Her &s;pirits are low; and we mu&s;t not pull down with one hand, what we build up with the other: My brother al&s;o will expect a good account of my charge.</P>
<P>I ble&s;&s;ed her for her goodne&s;s. And finding her
<PB N="189" REF="196">
de&s;irous of knowing all that I could tell her, of our cou&s;in's character, family, and Lovers, I gave her a brief hi&s;tory, which extremely plea&s;ed her. Good God! &s;aid &s;he, what a happine&s;s is it, that &s;uch a Lady, in &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hould meet with a man as excellent, and as much admired, as her&s;elf! My bro|ther, Mr. Reeves, can never marry but he mu&s;t break half a &s;core hearts. Forgive me, that I bring <HI>him</HI> in, whenever any good per&s;on, or thing, or action, is &s;poken of. Every-body, I believe, who is &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ubject, makes every-thing &s;een, heard, or read of, that bears the lea&s;t re&s;emblance, turn into and illu&s;trate that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But here I will conclude this Letter, in order to &s;end it by the po&s;t. Be&s;ides, I have been &s;o much fatigued in body and mind, and my wife has al&s;o been &s;o much di&s;turbed in <HI>her</HI> mind, that I mu&s;t give way to a call of re&s;t.</P>
<P>I will pur&s;ue the &s;ubject, the now agreeable &s;ubject, in the morning; and perhaps &s;hall di&s;patch what I &s;hall farther write, as you mu&s;t be impatient for it, by an e&s;pecial me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>Sir Rowland was here twice ye&s;terday, and once to|day. My wife cau&s;ed him to be told, that Mi&s;s Byron, by a &s;udden call, has been obliged to go a little way out of town for two or three days.</P>
<P>He propo&s;es to &s;et out for Caermarthen the begin|ning of next week. He hoped he &s;hould not be denied taking his <HI>corporal</HI> leave of her.</P>
<P>If our cou&s;in has a good day to-morrow, and no return of her fits, &s;he propo&s;es to be in town on Mon|day. I am to wait on her, and Sir Charles and his &s;i&s;ter, at breakfa&s;t on Monday morning, and to attend her home; where there will be joy indeed, on her arrival.</P>
<P>Pray receive for your&s;elf, and make for me to your Lady, and all friends, my compliments of congratu|lation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. From Mr. <HI>REEVES,</HI> To <HI>GEORGE SELBY,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>MISS Grandi&s;on went to my cou&s;in, to &s;ee how &s;he bore ri&s;ing, &s;uppo&s;ing her near dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>She &s;oon returned to me. The mo&s;t charming woman, I think, &s;aid &s;he, I ever &s;aw! But &s;he trem|bles &s;o, that I have per&s;uaded her to lie down. I an&s;wered for you, that you would &s;tay dinner.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg excu&s;e, madam. I have an excellent wife. She loves Mi&s;s Byron as her life: She will be impatient to know&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, well, well, &s;ay no more, Mr. Reeves: My brother has redeemed one pri&s;oner, and his &s;i&s;ter has taken another: And glad you may be, that it is no wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I bowed, and looked &s;illy, I believe.</P>
<P>You <HI>may</HI> look, and beg, and pray, Mr. Reeves. When you know me better, you'll find me a very whim&s;ical creature: But you mu&s;t &s;tay to &s;ee Sir Charles. Would you go home to your wife with half your errand? She won't thank you for that, I can tell you, let her be as good a woman as the be&s;t. But, to comfort you, we give not into every modern fa&s;hion, We dine earlier, than mo&s;t people of our condition. My brother, tho' in the main above &s;ingularity, will, neverthele&s;s, in things he thinks right, be govern'd by his own rules, which are the laws of rea&s;on and con|venience. You are on hor&s;eback; and, were I you, &s;uch good news as I &s;hould have to carry, con&s;idering
<PB N="191" REF="198">
what <HI>might</HI> have happened, would give me wings, and make me fly thro' the air with it.</P>
<P>I was about to &s;peak: Come, come, I will have no denial, interrupted &s;he: I &s;hall have a double plea&s;ure, if you are pre&s;ent when Sir Charles comes, on hearing his account of what happened. You are a good man, and have a <HI>rea&s;onable quantity</HI> of <HI>wonder</HI> and <HI>gratitude,</HI> to heighten a common ca&s;e into the <HI>marvellous.</HI> So &s;it down, and be quiet.</P>
<P>I was equally delighted and &s;urpri&s;ed at her hu|morous raillery; but could not an&s;wer a &s;ingle word. If it be midnight before you will &s;uffer me to depart, thought I, I will not make another objection.</P>
<P>While this amiable Lady was thus entertaining me, we heard the trampling of hor&s;es&mdash;My brother! &s;aid &s;he, I hope!&mdash;He comes! pardon the fondne&s;s of a &s;i&s;ter, who &s;peaks from &s;en&s;ible effects&mdash;A father and a brother in one!</P>
<P>Sir Charles entered the room. He addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to me in a mo&s;t polite manner. Mr. Reeves! &s;aid he, as I under&s;tand from below&mdash;Then turning to his &s;i&s;ter, Excu&s;e me Charlotte. I heard this worthy gentleman was with you: And I was impatient to know how my fair gue&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron is in a good way, I hope, interrupted &s;he, but very weak and low-&s;pirited. She aro&s;e and dre&s;&s;ed; but I have prevailed on her to lie down again.</P>
<P>Then turning to me, with a noble air, he both welcomed and congratulated me.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is indeed a fine figure. He is in the bloom of youth. I don't know that I have ever &s;een an hand&s;omer or genteeler man. Well might his &s;i&s;ter &s;ay, that if he married, he would break half a &s;core hearts. O this vile Pollexfen! thought I, at the moment; Could he draw upon, has he hurt, &s;uch a man as this?</P>
<P>After pouring out my acknowlegements, in the name
<PB N="192" REF="199" MS="y">
of &s;everal families, as well as my own, I could not but enquire into the nature of the hurt he had received.</P>
<P>A very trifle!&mdash;My coat only was hurt, Mr. Reeves. The &s;kin of my left &s;houlder raked a little, putting his hand upon it.</P>
<P>Thank God, &s;aid I: Thank God, &s;aid Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on&mdash;But &s;o <HI>near!</HI>&mdash;O the villain! what might it have been!&mdash;</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave, pent up in a chariot, had great di&s;|advantage. My reflexions on the event of ye&s;terday, yield me the more plea&s;ure, as I have, on enquiry, under&s;tood that he will do well again, if he will be ruled. I would not, on any account, have had his in&s;tant death to an&s;wer for. But no more of this ju&s;t now. Give me the particulars of the young Lady's &s;tate of health. I left her in a very bad way.&mdash;You had advice?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on gave her brother an account of all that had been done; and of every-thing that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince he went away; as al&s;o of the character and ex|cellencies of the Lady whom he had re&s;cued.</P>
<P>I confirmed what &s;he &s;aid in my cou&s;in's favour; and he very gratefully thanked his &s;i&s;ter for her care, as a man would do for one the neare&s;t and deare&s;t to him.</P>
<P>We then be&s;ought him to give an account of the glorious action, which had re&s;tored to all that knew her, the darling of our hearts.</P>
<P>I will relate all he &s;aid, in the fir&s;t per&s;on, as nearly in his own words as po&s;&s;ible; and will try to hit the coolne&s;s with which he told the agreeable &s;tory.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You know, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, the call I had to town. It was happy, that I yielded to your importunity to attend you hither.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'About two miles on this &s;ide Houn&s;low, I &s;aw a chariot-and-&s;ix driving at a great rate. I al&s;o had ordered Jerry to drive pretty fa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The coachman &s;eemed inclined to di&s;pute the

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The curtain of the chariot we met, was pulled down. I &s;aw not who was in it. But on turning out of the way, I knew by the arms it was Sir Har|grave Pollexfen's.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'There was in it a gentleman, who immediately pulled up the canvas.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I &s;aw, however, before he drew it up, another per&s;on, wrapt up in a man's &s;carlet cloak.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'For God's &s;ake! help, help! cried out the per&s;on: For God's &s;ake help!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I ordered my coachman to &s;top.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Drive on, &s;aid the gentleman; cur&s;ing his coach|man: Drive on when I bid you.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Help! again cried &s;he, but with a voice as if her mouth was half &s;topt.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I called to my &s;ervants on hor&s;eback to &s;top the po&s;tition of the other chariot. And I bid Sir Har|grave's coachman proceed at his peril.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Sir Hargrave called out on the contrary &s;ide of the chariot (his canvas being &s;till up on that next me) with vehement execrations to drive on.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I alighted, and went round to the other &s;ide of the chariot.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Again the Lady endeavoured to cry out. I &s;aw Sir Hargrave &s;truggle to pull over her mouth an handkerchief, which was tied round her head. He &s;wore outrageou&s;ly.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The moment &s;he beheld me, &s;he &s;pread out both her hands For God's &s;ake&mdash;</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You are impertinent, Sir. Who the devil are you?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Are you, madam, Lady Pollexfen? &s;aid I.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O no! no! no!&mdash;was all &s;he could &s;ay&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Two of my &s;ervants came about me; a third held the <HI>head</HI> of the hor&s;e on which the po&s;tilion &s;at.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Three of Sir Hargrave's approached on their hor&s;es; but &s;eemed as if afraid to come too near, and parley'd together.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Have an eye to tho&s;e fellows, &s;aid I. Some ba&s;e work is on foot. You'll pre&s;ently be aided by pa&s;&s;en|gers. Sirrah, &s;aid I to the coachman (forhela&s;h'd the hor&s;es on) proceed at your peril.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Sir Hargrave then, with violent cur&s;es and threat|enings, ordered him to drive over every one that op|po&s;ed him.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Coachman, proceed at your peril, &s;aid I. Madam, will you&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O Sir, Sir, Sir, relieve, help me for God's &s;ake! I am in a villain's hands! Trick'd, vilely trick'd, into a villain's hands. Help, help, for God's &s;ake!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Do you, &s;aid I, to Frederick, cut the traces, if you cannot otherwi&s;e &s;top this chariot. Bid Jerry cut the reins; and then &s;eize as many of tho&s;e fel|lows as you can. Leave Sir Hargrave to me.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The lady continued &s;creaming and crying out for help.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Sir Hargrave drew his &s;word, which he had held between his knees in the &s;cabbard; and then called upon his &s;ervants to fire at all that oppo&s;ed his pro|gre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'My &s;ervants, Sir, Hargrave, have fire-arms as well

as yours. They will not di&s;pute my orders. Don't provoke me to give the word.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Then addre&s;&s;ing the Lady, Will you, madam, put your&s;elf into my protection?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O yes, yes, yes, with my whole heart&mdash;Dear good Sir, protect me!</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I opened the chariot-door. Sir Hargrave made a pa&s;s at me. Take <HI>that,</HI> and be damn'd to you, for your in&s;olence, &s;coundrel! &s;aid he.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I was aware of his thur&s;t, and put it by; but his &s;word a little raked my &s;houlder.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'My &s;word was in my hand; but undrawn.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The chariot-door remaining open (I was not &s;o ceremonious, as to let down the foot-&s;tep to take the gentleman out) I &s;eized him by the collar before he could recover him&s;elf from the pa&s;s he had made at me; and with a jerk, and a kind of twi&s;t, laid him under the hind-wheel of his chariot.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I wrench'd his &s;word from him, and &s;napp'd it, and flung the two pieces over my head.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'His coachman cried out for his ma&s;ter. Mine threatened <HI>his</HI> if he &s;tirred. The po&s;tilion was a boy. My &s;ervant had made him di&s;mount, before he joined the other two, whom I had ordered aloud to endeavour to &s;eize (but my view was only to ter|rify) wretches, who, knowing the badne&s;s of their cau&s;e, were before terrified.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Sir Hargrave's mouth and face were very bloody. I believe I might hurt him with the pommel of my &s;word.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'One of his legs, in his &s;prawling, had got between the &s;pokes of his chariot-wheel. I thought that was a fortunate circum&s;tance for preventing further mi&s;|chief; and charged his coachman not to &s;tir with the chariot for his ma&s;ter's &s;ake.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He cried out, cur&s;ed, and &s;wore. I believe he was brui&s;ed with the fall. The jerk was violent, So little able to &s;upport an offence, Sir Hargrave,
<PB N="196" REF="203">
upon his own principles, &s;hould not have been &s;o ready to give it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I had not drawn my &s;word: I hope I never &s;hall be provoked to do it in a private quarrel. I &s;hould not however, have &s;crupled to draw it, on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion as this, had there been an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Lady, though greatly terrified, had di&s;|engaged her&s;elf from the man's cloak. I had not lei&s;ure to con&s;ider her dre&s;s; but I was &s;truck with her figure, and more with her terror.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I offered my hand. I thought not now of the foot-&s;tep, any more than I did before: She not of any-thing, as it &s;eemed, but her deliverance.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Have you not read, Mr. Reeves (Pliny, I think, gives the relation) of a frighted bird, that, pur&s;ued by an hawk, flew for protection into the bo&s;om of a man pa&s;&s;ing by?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'In like manner your lovely cou&s;in, the moment I returned to the chariot-door, in&s;tead of accepting of my offered hand, threw her&s;elf into my arms.&mdash;O &s;ave me! &s;ave me!&mdash;She was ready to faint. She could not, I believe, have &s;tood.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I carried the lovely creature round Sir Hargrave's hor&s;es, and &s;eated her in my chariot Be a&s;&s;ured, madam, &s;aid I, that you are in honourable hands. I will convey you to my &s;i&s;ter, who is a young Lady of honour and virtue.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'She look'd out at one window, then at the other, in vi&s;ible terror, as if fearing &s;till Sir Hargrave. Fear nothing, &s;aid I: I will attend you in a moment. I &s;hut the chariot-door.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I then went backward a few paces (keeping, how|ever, the Lady in my eye) to &s;ee what had become of my &s;ervants.</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Their con&s;ciences put them to &s;light.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'My &s;ervants pur&s;ued them a little way; but were returning to &s;upport their ma&s;ter, ju&s;t as I had put the lady into my chariot.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I &s;aw Sir Hargrave at a di&s;tance, on his legs, &s;up|ported by his coachman. He limped, leaned his whole weight upon his &s;ervant; and &s;eemed to be in agonies.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I bid one of my &s;ervants tell him who I was.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He cur&s;ed me, and threatened vengeance. He cur&s;ed my &s;ervants; and &s;till more outrageou&s;ly his own &s;coundrels, as he called them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I then &s;tept back to my chariot.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Mi&s;s Byron had, thro' terror, &s;unk down at the bottom of it; where &s;he lay panting, and could only &s;ay, on my approach, Save me! Save me!</Q></P>

<P>We were both about to break out in grateful ap|plau&s;es; but Sir Charles, as if de&s;igning to hinder us, proceeded.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You &s;ee, Mr. Reeves, what an ea&s;y conque&s;t this was. You &s;ee what a &s;mall degree of merit falls to my &s;hare. The violator's con&s;cience was again&s;t him. The con&s;ciences of his fellows were on my &s;ide. My own &s;ervants are hone&s;t worthy men. They love their ma&s;ter. In a good cau&s;e I would &s;et any three of them again&s;t &s;ix who were engag'd in a bad one. Vice is the greate&s;t coward in the world, when it knows it will be re&s;olutely oppos'd.
<PB N="198" REF="205">
And what have good men, engaged in a right cau&s;e, to fear,?'</Q></P>
<P>What an admirable man is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on!&mdash;Thus thinking! Thus acting!</P>
<P>I explained to Sir Charles who this Wil&s;on was, whom the others con&s;ulted and were directed by: and what an implement in this black tran&s;action.</P>
<P>To what other man's protection in the world, Mr. Selby, could our kin&s;woman have been obliged, and &s;o little mi&s;chief followed?</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave, it &s;eems, returned back to town. What a recreant figure, my dear Mr. Selby, mu&s;t he make, even to him&s;elf!&mdash;A villain!</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;ays, that the turnpike-men at Small|bury Green told his &s;ervants, on their attending him to town after the happy re&s;cue, a formidable &s;tory of a robbery committed a little beyond Houn&s;low by half a dozen villains on hor&s;eback, upon a gentleman in a chariot and &s;ix; which had pa&s;&s;ed thro' that turnpike but half an hour before he was a tacked; and that the gentleman, about an hour and half before Sir Charles went thro', returned to town, wounded, for advice; and they heard him groan as he pa&s;&s;ed through the turnpike.</P>
<P>I &s;hould add one circum&s;tance, &s;aid Sir Charles: Do you know, Charlotte, that you have a rake for your brother?&mdash;A man on hor&s;eback, it &s;eems, came to the turnpike-gate, whil&s;t the turnpike-men were telling my &s;ervants this &s;tory. Nothing in the world, &s;aid he, but two young rakes in their chariots-and-&s;ix, one robbing the other of a lady. I, and two other pa&s;&s;engers, added the man, &s;tood aloof to &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of the affair. We expected mi&s;chief: And &s;ome there was. One of the by-&s;tanders was the better for the fray; for he took up a &s;ilver-hilted &s;word, broken in two pieces, and rode off with it.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave, &s;aid Sir Charles, &s;miling, might well give out that he was robbed; to lo&s;e &s;uch a prize as Mi&s;s Byron, and his &s;word be&s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="206">
I a&s;ked Sir Charles, If it were not advi&s;able to take mea&s;ures with the villain?</P>
<P>He thought it be&s;t, he &s;aid, to take as little notice of the affair as po&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s the aggre&s;&s;or &s;tirr'd in it. Ma&s;querades, added he, are not creditable places for young ladies to be known to be <HI>in&s;ulted</HI> at them. They are diver&s;ions that fall not in with the genius of the Engli&s;h commonalty. Scandal will have &s;ome|thing to &s;ay from that circum&s;tance, however cau&s;e|le&s;s. But mi&s;s Byron's &s;tory, told by her&s;elf, will en|able you to re&s;olve upon your future mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>So, Sir Charles &s;eems not to be a friend to Ma&s;que|rades.</P>
<P>I think, were I to live an hundred years, I never would go to another. Had it not been for Lady Betty&mdash;She has, indeed, too gay a turn for a woman of forty, and a mother of children. Mi&s;s Byron, I dare &s;ay, will be afraid of giving the lead to her for the future. But, excepting my wife and &s;elf, nobody in town has &s;uffered more than Lady Betty on this occa&s;ion. Indeed &s;he is, I mu&s;t &s;ay, an obliging, well|meaning woman: And &s;he al&s;o declares (&s;o much has &s;he been affected with Mi&s;s Byron's danger, of which &s;he takes her&s;elf to be the innocent cau&s;e) that &s;he will never again go to a Ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>I long to have Mi&s;s Byron's account of this horrid affair.&mdash;God grant, that it may not be &s;uch a one, as will lay us under a nece&s;&s;ity&mdash;But as our cou&s;in has a great notion of female delicacy&mdash;I know not what I would &s;ay&mdash;We mu&s;t have patience a little while longer.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's eyes &s;hone with plea&s;ure all the time her brother was giving his relation.</P>
<P>I can only &s;ay, my brother, &s;aid &s;he, when he had done, that you have re&s;cued an angel of a woman; and you have made me as happy by it, as your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have a generous &s;i&s;ter, Mr. Reeves, &s;aid Sir Charles.</P>
<P>Till I knew my brother, Mr. Reeves, as I now
<PB N="200" REF="207">
know him, I was an incon&s;iderate, unreflecting girl. Good and evil which immediately affected not my &s;elf, were almo&s;t alike indifferent to me. But he has awakened in me a capacity to enjoy the true plea&s;ure that ari&s;es from a benevolent action.</P>
<P>Depreciate not, my Charlotte, your own worth. Ab&s;ence, Mr. Reeves, endears. I have been long abroad. Not much above a year returned: But when you know us better, you will find I have a partial &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves will not then think me &s;o. But I will go and &s;ee how my fair patient does.</P>
<P>She went accordingly to my cou&s;in.</P>
<P>O Sir Charles, &s;aid I, what an admirable woman is Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on!</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter Charlotte, Mr. Reeves, is indeed, an ex|cellent woman. I think my&s;elf happy in her. But I tell her &s;ometimes, that I have &s;till a <HI>more</HI> excellent &s;i&s;ter. And it is no &s;mall in&s;tance of Charlotte's greatne&s;s of mind, that &s;he her&s;elf will allow me to &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in the ladies: The two charming creatures entered together, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;upporting my trembling cou&s;in: But &s;he had fir&s;t acquainted her, that &s;he would find Sir Charles in <HI>her</HI> dre&s;&s;ing room.</P>
<P>She look'd indeed lovely, tho' wan, at her fir&s;t en|trance: But a fine glow over&s;pread her cheeks, at the &s;ight of her deliverer.</P>
<P>Sir Charles approached her, with an air of calmne&s;s and &s;erenity, for fear of giving her emotion. She ca&s;t her eyes upon him, with a look of the mo&s;t re&s;pectful gratitude.</P>
<P>I will not oppre&s;s my fair gue&s;t with many words: But permit me to congratulate you, as I hope I may, on your recovered &s;pirits&mdash;Allow me, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>And he took her almo&s;t motionle&s;s hand, and con|ducted her to an ea&s;y chair that had been &s;et for her. She &s;at down, and would have &s;aid &s;omething; but
<PB N="201" REF="208">
only bowed to Sir Charles, to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, and me; and reclined her head again&s;t the check of the chair.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on held her &s;alts to her.</P>
<P>She took them into her own hands, and &s;melling to them, rai&s;ed her head a little: Forgive me, madam! Pardon me, Sir!&mdash;O my cou&s;in, to me&mdash;How can I&mdash;So oppre&s;&s;ed with obligations!&mdash;Such goodne&s;s!&mdash;No words!&mdash;My gratitude!&mdash;My full heart!&mdash;</P>
<P>And then &s;he again reclined her head, as giving up hopele&s;ly the effort &s;he made to expre&s;s her gratitude.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not, madam, &s;aid Sir Charles, &s;itting down by her, over-rate a common benefit.&mdash;Dear Mi&s;s Byron (Permit me to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you, as of long acquaintance) by what Mr. Reeves has told my &s;i&s;ter, and both have told me, I mu&s;t think ye&s;ter|day one of the happie&s;t days of my life. I am &s;orry that our acquaintance has begun &s;o much at your co&s;t: But you mu&s;t let us turn this evil appearance into real good. I have two &s;i&s;ters: The world produces not more worthy women. Let me henceforth boa&s;t that I have three: And &s;hall I not then have rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on to re|joice in the event that has made &s;o lovely an addition to my family?</P>
<P>Then taking her pa&s;&s;ive hand with the tenderne&s;s of a truly affectionate brother, con&s;oling a &s;i&s;ter in cala|mity, and taking his &s;i&s;ter's, and joining both; Shall I not, madam, pre&s;ent my Charlotte to a &s;i&s;ter? And will you not permit me to claim as a brother under that relation?&mdash;Our Mi&s;s Byron's chri&s;tian name, Mr. Reeves?</P>
<P>Harriet, Sir.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter Harriet, receive and acknowlege your Charlotte. My Charlotte&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on aro&s;e and &s;aluted my cou&s;in; who look'd at Sir Charles with reverence, as well as grati|tude; at Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on with delight; and at me with eyes lifted up. And, after a little &s;truggle for

<P>I was afraid &s;he would have fainted.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t endeavour, Mr. Reeves, &s;aid Sir Chales to me, to le&s;&s;en the &s;en&s;e <HI>our</HI> Mi&s;s Byron has of her pa&s;t dan|ger, in order to bring down to rea&s;onable limits, the no|tion &s;he has of her obligation for a common relief.</P>

<P>The women, Mr. Selby, are ever looking forward on certain occa&s;ions. Lady Betty and my wife ex|tended their wi&s;hes &s;o far, as that they might be able to call Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on and our Mi&s;s Byron &s;i&s;ters; but by a claim that &s;hould exclude Sir Charles as a brother to one of them.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="210">
Should Sir Charles&mdash;But no more on this &s;ubject&mdash;Yet one word more: When the ladies had mention'd it, I could not help thinking that this graceful and truly fine gentleman &s;eems to be the only man, whom our cou&s;in has yet &s;een, that would meet with no great difficulty from her on &s;uch an application.</P>
<P>But Sir Charles has a great e&s;tate, and &s;till greater expectations from my Lord W. His &s;i&s;ter &s;ays, he would break half a &s;core hearts, were he to marry&mdash;So for that matter would our Mi&s;s Byron. But once more&mdash;Not another word however on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed to dine with this amiable brother and &s;i&s;ter.

I took leave of her, at her quitting the table.</P>

<P>I WILL write one more letter, my dear cou&s;in Selby, and then I will give up my pen to our be|loved cou&s;in.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="211">
I got to Colnebrooke by nine this morning. I had the plea&s;ure to find our Mi&s;s Byron recovered beyond my hopes. She had a very good night on Saturday; and all Sunday, &s;he &s;aid, was a cordial day to her from morning till night; and her night was quiet and happy.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;taid at home ye&s;terday to keep my cou&s;in company. Sir Charles pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the day in the library. The two ladies were hardly ever &s;eparated. My cou&s;in expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf in rap|tures whenever &s;he &s;peaks of this brother and &s;i&s;ter. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;he &s;ays (and indeed every one mu&s;t &s;ee it) is one of the franke&s;t and mo&s;t communicative of women. Sir Charles appears to be one of the mo&s;t unre&s;erved of men, as well as one of the mo&s;t polite. He makes not his gue&s;ts unea&s;y with his civilities: But you &s;ee freedom and ea&s;e in his whole deport|ment; and the &s;tranger cannot doubt but Sir Charles will be equally plea&s;ed with freedom and ea&s;e, in re|turn. I had an encouraging proof of the ju&s;tne&s;s of this ob&s;ervation this morning from him, as we &s;at at breakfa&s;t. I had expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, occa&s;ionally, in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hewed more re&s;pect than freedom: My dear Mr. Reeves, &s;aid he, kindred minds will be inti|mate at fir&s;t &s;ight. Receive me early into the li&s;t of your friends; I have already numbered you among mine. I &s;hould think ami&s;s of my&s;elf, if &s;o good a man as I am a&s;&s;ured Mr. Reeves is, &s;hould by his di&s;tance &s;hew a diffidence of me, that would not permit his mind to mingle with mine.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, my cou&s;in &s;ays, put her on relate|ing to her, her whole hi&s;tory; and the hi&s;tories of the &s;everal per&s;ons and families to whom &s;he is related.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron concluding as well as I, that Sir Charles would rather take his place in the coach, than go on hor&s;eback to town; and being &s;o happily recovered, as not to give us apprehen&s;ion about her bearing tole|rably the little journey, I kept my hor&s;e in our return,
<PB N="205" REF="212">
and Sir Charles went in the coach. This motion coming from Mi&s;s Byron, I raillied her upon it when I got her home: But &s;he won't forgive me, if &s;he knows that I told you, who&s;e the motion was. And yet the dear creature's eyes &s;parkled with plea&s;ure when &s;he had carried her point.</P>
<P>I was at home near half an hour before the coach arrived; and was a welcome gue&s;t.</P>
<P>My dear Mrs. Reeves told me &s;he had expected our arrival before dinner, and hoped Sir Charles and his &s;i&s;ter would dine with us. I hoped &s;o too, I told, her.</P>
<P>I found there Lady Betty and Mi&s;s Clements, a fa|vourite of us all, both impatiently waiting to &s;ee my cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Don't be jealous, Mr. Reeves, &s;aid my wife, if after what I have heard of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, and what he has done for us, I run to him with open arms.</P>
<P>I give you leave my dear to love him, replied I; and to expre&s;s your love in what manner you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have no doubt, &s;aid Lady Betty, that I &s;hall break my heart, if Sir Charles takes not very particular no|tice of me.</P>
<P>He &s;hall have my prayers as well as my prai&s;es, &s;aid Mi&s;s Clements.</P>
<P>She is acquainted with the whole &s;hocking affair.</P>
<P>When the coach &s;topt, and the bell rung, the &s;er|vants contended who &s;hould fir&s;t run to the door. I welcomed them at the coach. Sir Charles handed out Mi&s;s Byron, I Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: Sally, &s;aid my cou&s;in, to her raptured maid, take care of Mrs. Jenny.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was received by Mrs. Reeves, as I ex|pected. She was almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s with joy. He &s;aluted her: But I think, as I tell her, the fir&s;t mo|tion was hers. He was then obliged to go round; and my cou&s;in, I do a&s;&s;ure you, looked as if &s;he would not wi&s;h to have been neglected.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the ladies could &s;peak, they poured out
<PB N="206" REF="213">
their ble&s;&s;ings and thanks to him; and to Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on; whom, with a mo&s;t engaging air, he pre&s;ented to each lady; and &s;he, as engagingly, &s;aluted her &s;i&s;ter Harriet by that tender relation, and congratulated them, and Mi&s;s Byron, and her&s;elf, upon it; kindly be&s;peaking a family relation for her&s;elf thro' her dear Mi&s;s Byron, were her words.</P>
<P>When we were &s;eated, my wife and Lady Betty wanted to enter into the particulars of the happy de|liverance, in prai&s;e of the deliverer; but Sir Charles interrupting them, My dear Mrs. Reeves, &s;aid he, you cannot be too careful of this jewel. Every-thing may be tru&s;ted to her own di&s;cretion; but how can we well blame the man who would turn thief for &s;o rich a trea&s;ure? I do a&s;&s;ure you, my &s;i&s;ter Harriet (Do you know, Mrs. Reeves, that I have found my third &s;i&s;ter? Was &s;he not &s;tolen from us in her cradle?) that if Sir Hargrave will repent, I will forgive him for the &s;ake of the temptation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Reeves was plea&s;ed with this addre&s;s, and has talked of it &s;ince.</P>
<P>I never can forgive him, Sir, &s;aid Mi&s;s Byron, were it but&mdash;</P>
<P>That he has laid you under &s;uch an obligation, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, patting her hand with her fan, as &s;he &s;at over-again&s;t her: But hu&s;h, child! You &s;aid that before!&mdash;And then turning to Mrs. Reeves, Has not our new-found &s;i&s;ter a very proud heart, Mrs. Reeves?</P>
<P>And, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, reply'd my &s;miling, delighted cou&s;in, did you not a&s;k that que&s;tion be|fore?</P>
<P>I did, child, I did; but not of Mrs. Reeves&mdash;A compromi&s;e however&mdash;Do you talk no more of <HI>obli|gation,</HI> and I'll talk no more of <HI>pride.</HI></P>
<P>Charlotte ju&s;tly chides her Harriet, &s;aid Sir Charles. What mu&s;t the man have been that had declined his aid in a di&s;tre&s;s &s;o alarming? Not one word more therefore upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="214">
We were all di&s;appointed, that this amiable brother and &s;i&s;ter excu&s;ed them&s;elves from dining with us. All I mean of our own family; for Lady Betty and Mi&s;s Clements, not being able to &s;tay, were glad <HI>they</HI> did not.</P>
<P>They took leave, amid&s;t a thou&s;and grateful ble&s;&s;|ings and acknowlegements; Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on promi&s;ing to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ter Harriet very &s;oon again; and kindly renewing her wi&s;hes of intimacy.</P>
<P>When they went away, There goes your heart, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid Mrs. Reeves.</P>
<P>True, an&s;wered Mi&s;s Byron, if my heart have no place in it for any-thing but gratitude, as I believe it has not.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, added &s;he, is the mo&s;t agreeable of women&mdash;</P>
<P>And Sir Charles, rejoined Mrs. Reeves, archly, is the mo&s;t <HI>di&s;</HI>-agreeable of men.</P>
<P>Forbear, cou&s;in, reply'd Mi&s;s Byron, and blu&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;aid Lady Betty, you need not, my dear, be a&s;hamed, if it be &s;o.</P>
<P>Indeed you need not, joined in Mi&s;s Clements. I never &s;aw a finer man in my life. Such a lover, if one <HI>might</HI> have him&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>If, if</HI>&mdash;replied Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;But till <HI>if</HI> is out of the que&s;tion, &s;hould there not be &s;uch a thing as di&s;cretion, Mi&s;s Clements?</P>
<P>No doubt of it, returned that young Lady; and if it <HI>be</HI> to be &s;hewn by any woman on earth, where there is &s;uch a man as this in the que&s;tion, and in &s;uch circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t be by Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron was not &s;o thoroughly recovered, but that her &s;pirits began to &s;tag. We made her retire, and at her reque&s;t excu&s;ed her coming down to dinner.</P>
<P>I told you I had accepted of the offer made by La|dy Betty, when we were in dreadful uncertainty, that her &s;teward &s;hould make further enquiries about the
<PB N="208" REF="215">
people at Paddington. Nothing worth mentioning has occurred from tho&s;e enquiries; except confirming that the widow and her daughters are not people of bad characters. In all likelihood they thought they &s;hould intitle them&s;elves to the thanks of all Mi&s;s Byron's friends, when the marriage was completed with a man of Sir Hargrave's fortune.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger that I &s;ent to enquire after that Ba|genhall's character, has informed us, that it is a very profligate one; and that he is an intimate of Sir Har|grave: But no more is nece&s;&s;ary now, God be prai&s;ed, to be &s;aid of him.</P>
<P>The vile wretch him&s;elf, I hear, keeps his room; and it is whi&s;pered that he is more than half-crazed; in&s;omuch that his very attendants are afraid to go near him. We know not the nature of his hurt; but hurt he is, tho' in a fair way of recovery. He threatens, it &s;eems, de&s;truction to Sir Charles the moment he is able to go abroad. God pre&s;erve one of the worthie&s;t and be&s;t of men!</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave has turned off all the &s;ervants, we are told, that attended him on his &s;hocking but happily|di&s;appointed enterprize.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron intends to write to her Lucy by to|morrow's po&s;t (if &s;he continue mending,) an ample account of all that &s;he &s;uffered from the date of her la&s;t letter, to the hour of her happy deliverance. I am to give her minutes to the be&s;t of my recollection of what I have written to you, that &s;o the account may be as complete as po&s;&s;ible, and that &s;he may write no more than is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;eries, which &s;he is required to pre&s;erve. She begins this evening, &s;he bids me tell you, that you may be as little a while in &s;uppen&s;e about her as po&s;&s;ible. But if &s;he cannot fini&s;h by to-morrow night, &s;he will have an opportu|nity to di&s;patch her letter on Wedne&s;day by a &s;ervant of Mr. Greville's, whom he left in town with &s;ome commi&s;&s;ions, and who promi&s;es to call for any-thing we may have to &s;end to Selby-hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="216">
Sir Rowland&mdash;But let my cou&s;in write to you upon that and other matters. She knows what to &s;ay on that &s;ubject better than I do.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, Feb. 20.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IS it again given me to write to you, my Lucy! and in you, to all my revered friends! To write with chearfulne&s;s! To call upon you all to rejoice with me!&mdash;God be prai&s;ed!</P>
<P>What dangers have I e&s;caped! How have my head and my heart been affected! I dare not, as yet, think of the angui&s;h you all endured for me.</P>
<P>With what wretched levity did I conclude my la&s;t Letter! Giddy creature, that I was, vain and fooli&s;h!</P>
<P>But let me begin my &s;ad &s;tory. Your impatience all this while mu&s;t be too painful. Only let me pre|mi&s;e, that gaily as I boa&s;ted, when I wrote to you &s;o conceitedly, as it might &s;eem, of my dre&s;s, and of conque&s;ts, and I know not what non&s;en&s;e, I took no plea&s;ure at the place, in the &s;hoals of fools that &s;wam after me. I de&s;pi&s;ed my&s;elf and them. <HI>De&s;pi&s;ed!</HI> I was &s;hocked at both.</P>
<P>Two Luci&s;ers were among them: But the wor&s;t, the very wor&s;t Lucifer of all, appeared in a Harle|quin dre&s;s. He hopped and &s;kipt, and played the fool about me; and at la&s;t told me, He knew Mi&s;s Byron; and that he was, as he called him&s;elf, the de&s;pi&s;ed, the rejected, Sir Hargrave Pollexfen.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217">
He behaved, however, with complai&s;ance; and I had no apprehen&s;ion of what I was to &s;uffer from his villainy.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves has told you, that he &s;aw me into the chair provided for me by my vile new &s;ervant. O my Lucy! One branch of my vanity is intirely lopt off. I mu&s;t pretend to &s;ome &s;ort of &s;kill in phy&s;iognomy! Never more will I, for this fellow's &s;ake, pre&s;ume to depend on my judgment of peoples hearts framed from their countenances.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves has told you every-thing about the chair, and the chairmen. How can I de&s;cribe the mi&s;givings of my heart when I fir&s;t began to &s;u&s;pect treachery! But when I undrew the curtains, and found my&s;elf further deluded by another fal&s;e heart, who&s;e help I implored, and in the mid&s;t of fields, and &s;oon after the lights put out, I pierced the night air with my &s;creams, till I could &s;cream no more. I was taken out in fits: And when I came a little to my &s;en&s;es, I found my&s;elf on a bed, three women about me, one at my head, holding a bottle to my no&s;e, my no&s;trils &s;ore with hart&s;horn, and a &s;trong &s;mell of burnt fea|thers; but no man near me.</P>
<P>Where am I? Who are you, madam? And who are you? Where am I? Were the que&s;tions I fir&s;t a&s;ked.</P>
<P>The women were a mother and two daughters. The mother an&s;wered, You are not in bad hands.</P>
<P>God grant you &s;ay truth! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>No harm is intended you; only to make you one of the happie&s;t of women. We would not be con|cerned in a bad action.</P>
<P>I hope not: I hope not: Let me engage your pity, madam. You &s;eem to be a mother. The&s;e young gentlewomen, I pre&s;ume, are your daughters. Save me from ruin; I be&s;eech you, madam: Save me from ruin, as you would your daughters.</P>
<P>The&s;e young women <HI>are</HI> my daughters. They are &s;ober and mode&s;t women. No ruin is intended you.
<PB N="211" REF="218">
One of the riche&s;t and noble&s;t men in England is your admirer. He dies for you. He a&s;&s;ures me that he intends honourable marriage to you. You are not engaged, he &s;ays: And you mu&s;t and you &s;hall be his. You may &s;ave murder, madam, if you con&s;ent. He re&s;olves to be the death of any Lover whom you encourage.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be the vile contrivance of Sir Hargrave Pollex&s;en, immediately cried I out: Is it not? Is it not? Tell me; I <HI>beg</HI> of you to tell me.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e, and &s;at on the bed-&s;ide; and at that mo|ment in came the vile, vile Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P>I &s;creamed out. He threw him&s;elf at my feet. I reclined my head on the bo&s;om of the elderly per&s;on, and by hart&s;horn and water they had much ado to keep me out of a fit. Had he not withdrawn; had he kept in my &s;ight; I &s;hould certainly have fainted. But holding up my head, and &s;eeing only the women, I revived: And began to pray, to beg, to offer rewards, if they would facilitate my e&s;cape; or procure my &s;afety. But then came in again the hated man.</P>
<P>I beg of you, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, with an air of greater haughtine&s;s than before, to make your&s;elf ea&s;y, and hear what I have to &s;ay. It is in your own choice, in your own power, to be what you plea&s;e, and to make <HI>me</HI> what you plea&s;e. Do not therefore need|le&s;ly terrify your&s;elf. You &s;ee I am a determined man. Ladies, you may withdraw&mdash;</P>
<P>Not and leave me here!&mdash;And as they went out, I pu&s;hed by the mother, and between the daughters, and followed the foremo&s;t into the parlour; and then &s;unk down on my knees, wrapping my arms about her: O &s;ave me! &s;ave me! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>The vile wretch entered. I left her, and kneeled to him. I knew not what I did. I remember, I &s;aid, wringing my hands, If you have mercy; If you have compa&s;&s;ion; let me now, now, I be&s;eech you, Sir, this moment, experience your mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="219">
He gave them &s;ome motion, I &s;uppo&s;e, to with|draw (for by that time the widow and the other daughter were in the parlour); and they all three re|tired.</P>
<P>I have be&s;ought <HI>you,</HI> madam, and on my <HI>knees</HI> too, to &s;hew <HI>me</HI> mercy; but none would you &s;hew me, inexorable Mi&s;s Byron! Kneel, if you will; in your turn kneel, &s;upplicate, pray; you cannot be more in earne&s;t, than I was. Now are the tables turned.</P>
<P>Barbarous man! &s;aid I, ri&s;ing from my knees. My &s;pirit was rai&s;ed: But it as in&s;tantly &s;ub&s;ided. I be|&s;eech you, Sir Hargrave, in a quite frantic way, wringing my hands, and coming near him, and then running to the window, and then to the door (with|out meaning to go out at either, had they been open; for whither could I go?) and then again to him; Be not, I be&s;eech you, Sir Hargrave, cruel to me. I never was cruel to any-body. You know I was civil to you; I was <HI>very</HI> civil&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, yes, and very determined. You called me no names. I call you none, Mi&s;s Byron. You were very civil. Hitherto <HI>I</HI> have not been uncivil. But remember, madam&mdash;But, &s;weet and ever-adorable creature, and he cla&s;ped his arms about me, your very terror is beautiful! I can <HI>enjoy</HI> your terror, ma|dam&mdash;And the &s;avage would have ki&s;&s;ed me. My averted head fru&s;trated his intention; and at his feet I be&s;ought him not to treat the poor creature whom he had &s;o vilely betrayed, with indignity.</P>
<P>I don't hit your fancy, <HI>madam!</HI></P>
<P>Can you be a malicious man, Sir Hargrave?</P>
<P>You don't like my morals, <HI>madam!</HI></P>
<P>And is this the way, Sir Hargrave, are the&s;e the means you take, to convince me that I ought to like them?</P>
<P>Well, madam, you &s;hall prove the mercy in me you would not &s;hew. You &s;hall &s;ee that I cannot be a malicious man; a revengeful man: And yet you
<PB N="213" REF="220">
have rai&s;ed my pride. You &s;hall find me a <HI>moral</HI> man.</P>
<P>Then, Sir Hargrave, will I ble&s;s you from the bot|tom of my heart!</P>
<P>But you know what will ju&s;tify me in every eye for the &s;teps I have taken. Be mine, madam. Be le|gally mine. I offer you my hone&s;t hand. Con&s;ent to be Lady Pollexfen&mdash;No puni&s;hment, I hope&mdash;Or, take the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>What, Sir! ju&s;tify by &s;o poor, &s;o <HI>very</HI> poor a com|pliance, &s;teps that you have &s;o ba&s;ely taken!&mdash;Take my life, Sir: But my hand and my heart are my own: They never &s;hall be &s;eparated.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e from my knees, trembling; and threw my|&s;elf upon the window-&s;eat, and wept bitterly.</P>
<P>He came to me. I looked on this &s;ide and on that, wi&s;hing to avoid him.</P>
<P>You cannot fly, madam. You are &s;ecurely mine: And mine &s;till more &s;ecurely you &s;hall be. Don't provoke me: Don't make me de&s;perate. By all that's Good and Holy&mdash;</P>
<P>He ca&s;t his eyes at my feet; then at my face; then threw him&s;elf at my feet, and embraced my knees with his odious arms.</P>
<P>I was terrified. I &s;creamed. In ran one of the daughters&mdash;Good Sir! Pray, Sir!&mdash;Did you not &s;ay you would be honourable?</P>
<P>Her mother followed her in&mdash;Sir, Sir! In my hou&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>Thank God, thought I, the people here are better than I had rea&s;on to apprehend the were. But, O my Lucy, they &s;eemed to believe, that marriage would make amends for every outrage.</P>

<P>WHAT a plague, &s;aid the wretch to the women, do you come in for? I thought you knew your own Sex better than to mind a woman's &s;qualling. They are always ready, &s;aid the odious fellow, to put us in mind of the occa&s;ion we ought to give them for crying out. I have not offered the lea&s;t rudene&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>I hope not, Sir. I hope my hou&s;e&mdash;So &s;weet a creature&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear ble&s;&s;ed, ble&s;&s;ed women (frantic with terror, and mingled joy, to find my&s;elf in better hands than I expected&mdash;Standing up, and then &s;itting down, I believe at every &s;entence) Protect me! Save me! Be my advocate! Indeed I have not de&s;erved this trea|cherous treatment. Indeed I am a good &s;ort of body (I &s;carce knew what I &s;aid): All my friends love me. They will break their hearts, if any mi&s;hap be&s;al me: They are all good people: You would love them dearly if you knew them: Sir Hargrave may have better and richer wives than I: Pray prevail upon him to &s;pare me to my friends, for <HI>their</HI> &s;ake. I will forgive him for all he has done.</P>
<P>Nay, dear Lady, if Sir Hargrave will make you his lawful and true wife, there can be no harm done, &s;urely.</P>
<P>I will, I will, Mrs. Awberry, &s;aid he. I have pro|mi&s;ed, and I will perform. But if &s;he &s;tand in her own light&mdash;She expects nothing from my <HI>morals</HI>&mdash;If &s;he &s;tand in her own light; and looked fiercely&mdash;</P>
<P>God protect me! &s;aid I; God protect me!</P>
<P>The gentleman is without, Sir, &s;aid the woman. O how my heart at that moment &s;eemed to be at my throat! What gentleman! thought I: Some one come to &s;ave me!&mdash;O no!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="222">
And in&s;tantly entered the mo&s;t horrible-looking clergyman that I ever beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ld.</P>
<P>This, as near as I can recollect, is his de&s;cription&mdash;A va&s;t tall, big-boned, &s;play-footed man. A &s;habby gown; as &s;habby a wig; an huge red pimply face; and a no&s;e that hid half of it, when he looked on one &s;ide, and he &s;eldom looked fore right when I &s;aw him. He had a dog's-eared common-prayer book in his hand, which once had been gilt; opened, horrid &s;ight! at the page of matrimony!</P>
<P>Yet I was &s;o intent upon making a friend, when a man, a clergyman, appeared, that I heeded not, at his entrance, his frightful vi&s;age, as I did afterwards. I pu&s;hed by Sir Hargrave, turning him half round with my vehemence, and made Mrs. Awberry totter; and throwing my&s;elf at the clergyman's feet, Man of God, &s;aid I, my hands cla&s;ped, and held up; Man of God! Gentleman! Worthy man!&mdash;A good clergyman mu&s;t be all this!&mdash;If ever you had children! &s;ave a poor creature! ba&s;ely tricked away from all her friends! innocent! thinking no harm to any-body! I would not hurt a worm! I love every-body!&mdash;Save me from violence! Give not your aid to &s;anctify a ba&s;e action.</P>
<P>The man &s;nuffled his an&s;wer through his no&s;e. When he opened his pouched mouth, the tobacco hung about his great yellow teeth. He &s;quinted upon me, and took my cla&s;ped hands&punc; which were buried in his huge hand, Ri&s;e, madam! Kneel not to me! No harm is intended you. One que&s;tion, only: Who is that gen|tleman before me, in the &s;ilver-laced cloaths? What is his name?&mdash;</P>
<P>He is Sir Hargrave Pollex&s;en, Sir: A wicked, a very wicked man, for all he looks &s;o!</P>
<P>The vile wretch &s;tood &s;miling, and enjoying my di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>O madam! A very hon-our-able man! bowing, like a &s;ycophant, to Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="223">
And who pray, madam, are you? What is your name?</P>
<P>Harriet Byron, Sir: A poor innocent creature, (looking at my dre&s;s) though I make &s;uch a vile appear|ance&mdash;Good Sir, your pity! And I &s;unk down again at his feet.</P>
<P>Of Northampton&s;hire, madam? You are a &s;ingle woman! Your uncle's name&mdash;</P>
<P>Is Selby, Sir. A very good man&mdash;I will reward you, Sir, as the mo&s;t grateful heart&mdash;</P>
<P>All is fair: All is above-board: All is as it was repre&s;ented. I am above bribes, madam. You will be the happie&s;t of women before day break&mdash;<HI>Good people!</HI>&mdash;The three women advanced.</P>
<P>Then I &s;aw what an ugly wretch he was!</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave advanced. The Two horrid creatures rai&s;ed me between them. Sir Hargrave took my &s;truggling hand: And then I &s;aw another ill-looking man enter the room, who I &s;uppo&s;e was to give me to the hated man.</P>
<P><HI>Dearly beloved,</HI> began to read the &s;nuffling mon|&s;ter&mdash;</P>
<P>O my Lucy! Does not your heart ake for your Harriet? Mine has &s;eemed to turn over and over, round and round, I don't know how, at the recital&mdash;It was ready to choak me at the time.</P>

<P>I WAS again like one frantic. Read no more! &s;aid I; and in my phren&s;y, da&s;hed the book out of the mini&s;ter's hand, if a mini&s;ter he was. I beg your pardon, Sir, &s;aid I; but you mu&s;t read no further. I am ba&s;ely betrayed hither. I cannot, I will not, be his.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="224">
Proceed, proceed, &s;aid Sir Hargrave, taking my hand by force; virago as &s;he is, I will own her for my wife&mdash;Are <HI>you</HI> the <HI>gentle,</HI> the <HI>civil</HI> Mi&s;s Byron, madam? looking &s;neeringly in my face.</P>
<P>Alas! my Lucy, I was no virago: I was in a perfect phren&s;y: But it was not an unhappy phren&s;y; &s;ince in all probability it kept me from falling into fits; and fits, the villain had &s;aid, &s;hould not &s;ave me.</P>
<P><HI>Dearly beloved,</HI> again &s;nuffled the wretch. O my Lu|cy! I &s;hall never love the&s;e words. How may odious circum&s;tances invert the force of the kinde&s;t words! Sir Hargrave &s;till detained my &s;truggling hand.</P>
<P>I &s;tamped, and threw my&s;elf to the length of my arm, as he held my hand. No <HI>dearly beloved's,</HI> &s;aid I. I was ju&s;t be&s;ide my&s;elf. What to &s;ay, what to do, I knew not.</P>
<P>The cruel wretch laughed at me; <HI>No dearly be|loved's!</HI> repeated he: Very comical, faith! and laugh|ed again: But proceed, proceed, doctor.</P>
<P>We are gathered together here in the &s;ight of God, <HI>read he on.</HI></P>
<P>This affected me &s;till more. I adjure you, Sir, to the mini&s;ter, by that God in who&s;e &s;ight, you read, we are gathered together, that you proceed no further. I adjure you, Sir Hargrave, in the &s;ame tremendous Name, that you &s;top further proceedings. My life take: With all my heart, take my life: But my hand never, never, will I join with yours.</P>
<P>Proceed, doctor: Doctor, pray proceed, &s;aid the vile Sir Hargrave. When the day dawns, &s;he will be glad to own her marriage.</P>
<P>Proceed at your peril, Sir, &s;aid I. If you are really and truly a mini&s;ter of that God who&s;e pre&s;ence what you have read &s;uppo&s;es, do <HI>not</HI> proceed: Do not make me de&s;perate.&mdash;Madam, turning to the widow, you are a mother, and have given me room to hope you are a good woman; look upon me as if I were one of tho&s;e daughters, whom I &s;ee before me: Could

Plead for me! Be my advocate! Each of you, if ye are women, plead for me, as you would your&s;elves wi&s;h to be pleaded for, in my circum&s;tances, and were thus barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed!</P>
<P>The young women wept. The mother was moved.</P>
<P>I wonder I kept my head. My brain was on fire.</P>
<P>Still, &s;till, the unmoved Sir Hargrave cried out, Pro|ceed, proceed, doctor: To-morrow before noon, all will be as it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>The man who &s;tood aloof (the &s;lie&s;t, &s;odden-faced creature I ever &s;aw) came nearer&mdash;To the que&s;tion, doctor, and to my part, if you plea&s;e!&mdash;Am not I her father?&mdash;To the que&s;tion, doctor, if you plea&s;e!&mdash;The gentlewomen will prepare her for what is to fol|low.</P>
<P>O thou <HI>man!</HI> Of heart the mo&s;t obdurate and vile! And will ye, looking at every per&s;on, one hand held up (for &s;till the vile man griped the other quite be|numbed hand in his iron paw) and adjuring each, Will ye &s;ee this violence done to a poor young creature?&mdash;A &s;oul, gentlewomen, you may have to an&s;wer for. I <HI>can</HI> die. Never, never, will I be his.</P>
<P>Let us women talk to the Lady by our&s;elves, Sir Hargrave. Pray your honour, let us talk to her by our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Ay, ay, ay, &s;aid the par&s;on, by all means: Let the Ladies talk to one another, Sir. She may be brought to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>He let go my hand. The widow took it. And was leading me out of the room&mdash;Not up &s;tairs, I hope, madam, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>You &s;han't then, &s;aid &s;he. Come, Sally; come, Deb; let us women go out together.</P>
<P>They led me into a little room adjoining to the par|lour:
<PB N="219" REF="226">
And then, my &s;pirits &s;ub&s;iding, I thought I &s;hould have fainted away. I had more hart&s;horn and water poured down my throat.</P>
<P>When they had brought me a little to my&s;elf, they pleaded with me Sir Hargrave's great e&s;tate.&mdash;What are riches to me? Dirt, dirt, dirt&punc; I hate them. They cannot purcha&s;e peace of mind: I want not riches.</P>
<P>They pleaded his honourable Love&mdash;I my invinci|ble Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was a hand&s;ome man&mdash;The mo&s;t odious in my eyes of the human &s;pecies. Never, never, &s;hould my con&s;ent be had to &s;anctify &s;uch a ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>My danger! And that they &s;hould not be able to &s;ave me from wor&s;e treatment&mdash;</P>
<P>How!&mdash;<HI>Not able!</HI>&mdash;Ladies, madam, is not this your own hou&s;e? Cannot you rai&s;e a neighbourhood? Have you no neighbours? A thou&s;and pounds will I order to be paid into your hands for a pre&s;ent before the week is out; I pledge my honour for the payment&punc; if you will but &s;ave me from a violence, that no worthy woman can &s;ee offered to a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed young creature!&mdash;A thou&s;and pounds!&mdash;Dear Ladies! Only to &s;ave me, and &s;ee me &s;afe to my friends!</P>
<P>The wretches in the next room, no doubt, heard all that pa&s;&s;ed. In at that moment came Sir Hargrave: Mrs. Awberry, &s;aid he, with a vi&s;age &s;welled with malice, young Ladies, we keep you up; we di&s;turb you. Pray retire to your own re&s;t: Leave me to talk with this perver&s;e woman. She is mine.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir Hargrave, &s;aid Mrs Awberry&mdash;</P>
<P>Leave her to <HI>me,</HI> I &s;ay:&mdash;Mi&s;s Byron, you <HI>&s;hall</HI> be mine. Your Grevilles, madam, your Fenwicks, your Ormes, when they know the pains and the expence I have been at, to &s;ecure you, &s;hall confe&s;s me their &s;u|perior&mdash;Shall confe&s;s&mdash;</P>

<HI>You</HI> talk of cruelty, Mi&s;s Byron! triumphing over &s;cores of pro&s;trate Lovers, madam! You remember your treatment of me, madam! Kneeling, like an abject wretch, at your feet!

<P>Vile, vile, deba&s;ement! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>To exalt Mi&s;s Byron into Lady Pollexfen. And yet if you hold not out your hand to me&mdash;</P>
<P>He would have &s;natched my hand. I put it behind me. He would have &s;natched the other: I put that behind me too: And the vile wretch would then have ki&s;&s;ed my undefended neck: But, with both my hands, I pu&s;hed his audacious forehead from me. Charming creature! he called me, with pa&s;&s;ion in his look and accent: Then, cruel, proud, ungrateful: And &s;wore by his Maker, that if I would not give my hand in|&s;tantly, in&s;tead of <HI>exalting</HI> me, he would <HI>humble</HI> me. Ladies, pray withdraw, &s;aid he. Leave her to me: Either Lady Pollexfen, or what I plea&s;e; rearing him|&s;elf proudly up! She may be happy if &s;he will. Leave her to me.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, &s;aid the younge&s;t of the two daughters; and wept for me.</P>

<P>Madam, <HI>pray,</HI> madam, &s;aid the widow to me, con|&s;ider what you are about, and whom you refu&s;e. Can you have a hand&s;omer man? Can you have a man of a greater fortune? Sir Hargrave means nothing but what is honourable. You are in his power&mdash;</P>
<P>In <HI>his</HI> power, madam! returned I: I am in <HI>yours.</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="228">
You are mi&s;tre&s;s of this hou&s;e. I claim the protection of it. Have you not neighbours? <HI>Your</HI> protection I put my&s;elf under.

<P>The wicked man took the mother and younge&s;t daughter each by her hand, after he had di&s;engaged the former from my cla&s;ping arms, and led them to the door. The elder followed them of her own ac|cord. They none of them &s;truggled again&s;t going. I begged, prayed, be&s;ought them not to go; and, when they did, would have thru&s;t my&s;elf out with them. But the wretch, in &s;hutting them out, &s;queezed me dreadfully, as I was half in, half out; and my no&s;e gu&s;hed out with blood.</P>
<P>I &s;creamed: He &s;eemed frighted: But in&s;tantly re|covering my&s;elf&mdash;So, &s;o, you have done your wor&s;t!&mdash;You have killed me, I hope.

<P>I was in dreadful pain. I talked half wildly, I re|member. I threw my&s;elf in a chair&mdash;So, &s;o, you have killed me, I hope&mdash;Well, now I hope, now I hope, you are &s;atisfied.

<P>I Under&s;tood afterwards that he was in the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;ternation. He had fa&s;tened the door upon me and him&s;elf; and for a few moments was not enough pre&s;ent to him&s;elf to open it. Yet crying out upon his God to have mercy upon him, and running about the room, the women ha&s;tily rapped at the door. Then he ran to it, opened it, cur&s;ed him&s;elf, and be|&s;ought them to recover me, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>They &s;aid I had death in my face: They lamented over me: My no&s;e had done bleeding: But, careful of his own &s;afety in the mid&s;t of his terror, he took my bloody handkerchief; if I did not recover, he &s;aid, <HI>that</HI> &s;hould not appear again&s;t him; and he ha&s;ten'd into the next room, and thru&s;t it into the fire; by which were &s;itting, it &s;eems, the mini&s;ter and his hel|per, over &s;ome burnt brandy.</P>
<P>O gentlemen! cried the wretch, nothing can be done to night. Take this; and gave them money. The Lady is in a &s;it. I wi&s;h you well home.</P>
<P>The younger daughter reported this to me after|wards, and what follows: They had de&s;ired the maid, it &s;eems, to bring them more firing, and a jug of ale; and they would &s;it in the chimney-corner, they &s;aid, till peep of day: But the &s;ame young woman who was taken off from her errand, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, finding me, as they all thought, not likely to recover, ran in to them, and declared, that the Lady was dead, cer|tainly dead; and what, &s;aid &s;he, will become of us all? This terrified the two men. They &s;aid, It was then time for them to be gone. Accordingly, taking each of them another dram, they &s;natched up their hats and &s;ticks, and away they hurried; hoping, the doctor &s;aid, that as they were innocent, and only
<PB N="223" REF="230">
meant to &s;erve the gentleman, their names, whatever happened, would not be called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>When I came a little to my&s;elf, I found the three women only with me. I was in a cold &s;weat, all over &s;hivering. There was no fire in that room: They led me into the parlour, which the two men had quitted&punc; and &s;et me down in an elbow chair; for I could hardly &s;tand, or &s;upport my&s;elf; and cha&s;ed my temples with Hungary-water.</P>
<P>Wretched creatures, men of this ca&s;t, my Lucy, thus to &s;port with the healths and happine&s;s of poor creatures whom they pretend to love&punc; I am afraid I never &s;hall be what I was. At times I am very &s;en&s;i|ble at my &s;tomach of this violent &s;queeze.</P>
<P>The mother and elder &s;i&s;ter left me &s;oon after, and went to Sir Hargrave. I can only gue&s;s at the re&s;ult of their deliberations by what followed.</P>
<P>The younger &s;i&s;ter, with compa&s;&s;ionate frankne&s;s, an&s;wered all my que&s;tions, and let me know all the above particulars. Yet &s;he wonder'd that I could refu&s;e &s;o hand&s;ome and &s;o rich a man as Sir Hargrave.</P>

Her mother would not do an ill thing, &s;he &s;aid, for the world: And &s;he had a brother who had a place in the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, and was as hone&s;t a man, tho' &s;he &s;aid it, as any in it. She owned that &s;he knew my new vile &s;er|vant; and prai&s;ed his fidelity to the ma&s;ters he had &s;erved, in &s;uch high terms, as if &s;he thought all du|ties were compri&s;ed in that one, of obeying his prin|cipal, right or wrong.

I &s;oon found that the &s;imple girl was in love with this vile, this &s;pecious fellow. She could not bear to hear me hint any-thing in his di&s;|favour, as, by way of warning to her, I would have done.

<P>We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ere broken in upon, as I was intending to a&s;k more que&s;tions (for I find this Wil&s;on was the prime agent in all this mi&s;chief) when the elder &s;i&s;ter called out the younger: And in&s;tantly came in Sir Har|grave.</P>
<P>He took a chair, and &s;at down by me, one leg thrown over the knee of the other; his elbow upon that knee, and his hand &s;upporting his bow'd-down head; biting his lips; looking at me, then from me, then at me again, five or &s;ix times, as in malice.</P>
<P>Ill-natured, &s;piteful, moody wretch! thought I, (trembling at his &s;trange &s;ilence, after &s;uch hurt as he had done me, and what I had endur'd, and &s;till felt in my &s;tomach and arm) what an odious creature thou art!</P>
<P>At la&s;t I broke &s;ilence. I thought I would be as mild as I could, and not provoke him to do me fur|ther mi&s;chief. Well have you done, Sir Hargrave, (have you not?) to commit &s;uch a violence upon a poor young creature that never did nor thought you evil!</P>
<P>I pau&s;ed. He was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>What di&s;traction have you given to my poor cou&s;in Reeves's! How my heart bleeds for them!</P>
<P>I &s;topt. He was &s;till &s;ilent.</P>

<P>I &s;topt, thinking he would go on: But he &s;aid no more; only changing his po&s;ture; and then re&s;ume|ing it.</P>
<P>The&s;e people, Sir, &s;eem to be hone&s;t people. I hope you de&s;igned only to terrify me. Your bringing me into no wor&s;e company is an a&s;&s;urance to me that you meant better, than&mdash;</P>

I thought he was going on; but he grinned, &s;hook his head, and then again reclined it upon his hand.</P>
<P>I forgive you, Sir, the pain you have given me.&mdash;But my friends&mdash;As &s;oon as day breaks (and I hope that is not far off) I will get the women to let my cou&s;in Reeves&mdash;</P>
<P>Then up he &s;tarted&mdash;Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, you are a <HI>woman;</HI> a <HI>true</HI> woman&mdash;And held up his hand, clenched. I knew not what to think of his intention.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron, proceeded he, after a pau&s;e, you are the mo&s;t con&s;ummate hypocrite that I ever knew in my life: And yet I thought that the be&s;t of you all could fall into fits and &s;woonings whenever you plea&s;ed.</P>

<P>I wept. I <HI>could not</HI> then &s;peak.</P>
<P>Can't you go into fits again? Can't you? &s;aid the barbarian; with an air of a piece with his words; and u&s;ing other words of the lowe&s;t reproach.</P>
<P>God deliver me, prayed I to my&s;elf, from the hands of this madman!</P>
<P>I aro&s;e, and as the candle &s;tood near the gla&s;s&punc; I &s;aw in it my vile figure, in this abominable habit,
<PB N="226" REF="233">
to which, till then, I had paid little attention. O how I &s;corned my&s;elf!</P>
<P>Pray, Sir Hargrave, &s;aid I, let me <HI>beg</HI> that you will not terrify me further. I will forgive you for all you have hitherto done, and place it to my own account, as a proper puni&s;hment for con&s;enting to be thus marked for a vain and fooli&s;h creature. Your abu&s;e, Sir, give me leave to &s;ay, is low and unmanly: But in the light of a puni&s;hment I will own it to be all de&s;erved: And let here my puni&s;hment end, and I will thank you and forgive you with my whole heart.</P>
<P>Your fate is <HI>determined,</HI> Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in a &s;ervant-maid with a capuchin, who whi&s;pered &s;omething to him: To which he an|&s;wered, <HI>That's well</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>He took the capuchin; the maid withdrew; and approached me with it. I &s;tarted, trembled, and was ready to &s;aint. I caught hold of the back of the el|bow chair.</P>

And t'other Mi&s;s&mdash;I forget your names&mdash;If you a e good creatures, as I hoped you were&mdash;</P>

<P>And &s;o am I, &s;aid the wicked man.&mdash;Pray, Mi&s;s Sally, put on this Lady's capuchin!</P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me, for why? for what? I have no capuchin!</P>
<P>I would not permit her to put it on, as &s;he would have done.</P>
<P>The &s;avage then wrapt his arms about mine, and made me &s;o very &s;en&s;ible by his force, of the pain I had had by the &s;queeze of the door, that I could not help crying out. The young woman put on the ca|puchin whether I would or not.</P>
<P>Now, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, make your&s;elf ea&s;y&punc; or command a fit, it is all one: My end will be better &s;erved by the latter&mdash;Mi&s;s Sally, give orders.</P>
<P>She ran out with the candle. Frank, give me the cloak, &s;aid Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P>The fellow had a red cloak on his arm. His bar|barous ma&s;ter took it from him. To your po&s;ts, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>The two men withdrew in ha&s;te. Now, my deare&s;t life, &s;aid he, with an air of in&s;ult, as I thought, you command your fate, if you are ea&s;y.</P>
<P>He threw the cloak about me.</P>
<P>I begged, prayed, would have kneeled to him: But all was in vain: The tyger-hearted man, as Mr. Greville had truly called him, muffled me up in it, and by force carried me thro' a long entry to the fore|door. There was ready a chariot-and-&s;ix; and that Sally was at the door with a lighted candle.</P>
<P>I called out to her. I called out for her mother; for the other &s;i&s;ter. I be&s;ought him to let me &s;ay but &s;ix words to the widow.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="235">
But no widow was to appear; no younger &s;i&s;ter: She was perhaps more tender-hearted than the elder: And in &s;pite of all my &s;truggles, prayers, re&s;i&s;tance, he lifted me into the chariot.</P>
<P>Men on hor&s;eback were about it. I thought <HI>that</HI> Wil&s;on was one of them; and &s;o it proved. Sir Hargrave &s;aid to that fellow, You know what tale to tell, if you meet with impertinents. And in, he came him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;cream'd. Scream on, my dear, upbraidingly &s;aid he; and barbarou&s;ly mocked me, imitating, low wretch! the bleating of a &s;heep [Could you not have killed him for this, my Lucy?] Then rearing him&s;elf up, Now am I Lord of Mi&s;s Byron! exulted he.</P>
<P>Still I &s;creamed for help; and he put his hand before my mouth, tho' vowing honour, and &s;uch &s;ort of &s;tuff; and, with his unmanly roughne&s;s, made me bite my lip. And away la&s;hed the coachman with your poor Harriet.</P>

<DIV2 N="33" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>AS the chariot drove by hou&s;es, I cried out for help once or twice, at &s;etting out. But under pretence of preventing my taking cold, he tied an handkechief over my face, head, and mouth, having fir&s;t muffled me up in the cloak; pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t my arm with his whole weight, &s;o that I had not my hands at liberty. And when he had done, he &s;eized them, and held them both in his left hand, while his right-arm thrown round me, kept me fa&s;t on the &s;eat. And except that now-and-then my &s;truggling head gave me a little opening, I was blinded.</P>
<P>But at one place on the road, ju&s;t after I had &s;cream|ed, and made another effort to get my hands free, I heard voices, and immediately the chariot &s;topt. Then
<PB N="229" REF="236">
how my heart was filled with hope! But, alas! it was but momentary. I heard one of his men &s;ay (that Wil&s;on I believe) The be&s;t of hu&s;band's, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, and &s;he is the wor&s;t of wives.</P>
<P>I &s;creamed again. Ay, &s;cream and be d&mdash;n'd, I heard &s;aid in a &s;tranger's voice, if that be the ca&s;e. Poor gentleman! I pity him with all my heart. And immediately the coachman drove on again.</P>
<P>The vile wretch laughed; That's <HI>you,</HI> my dear, and hugged me round. <HI>You</HI> are the d&mdash;n'd wife. And again he laughed: By my &s;oul I am a charming contriver! Greville, Fenwick, Orme, where are you now?&mdash;By my &s;oul, this will be a pretty &s;tory to tell when all your fears are over, my Byron!</P>
<P>I was ready to faint &s;everal times. I begged for air: And when we were in an open road, and I &s;uppo&s;e there was nobody in &s;ight, he vouch&s;afed to pull down the blinding handkerchief, but kept it over my mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h; &s;o that except now-and-then, that I &s;truggled it a&s;ide with my head (and my neck is &s;till, my dear, very &s;tiff with my efforts to free my face) I could only make a murmuring kind of noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The curtain of the fore-gla&s;s was pulled down, and generally the canvas on both &s;ides drawn up. But I was &s;ure to be made acquainted when we came near hou&s;es, by his care again to blind and &s;tifle me up.</P>
<P>A little before we were met by my deliverer, I had, by getting one hand free, unmuffled my&s;elf &s;o far as to &s;ee (as I had gue&s;&s;ed once or twice before by the &s;tone pavements) that we were going thro' a town; and then I again vehemently &s;creamed. But he had the cruelty to thru&s;t an handkerchief into my mouth, &s;o that I was almo&s;t &s;tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">led; and my mouth was hurt, and is &s;till &s;ore, with that and his former violence of the like nature.</P>
<P>Indeed, he now-and-then made apologies for the cruelty, to which, he &s;aid&punc; he was compelled, by my invincible ob&s;tinacy, to have recour&s;e. I was &s;orely
<PB N="230" REF="237">
hurt, he &s;aid, to be the wife of a man of his con&s;ider|ation! But I <HI>&s;hould</HI> be that, or wor&s;e. He was <HI>in for it</HI> (he &s;aid more than once) and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> proceed. I might &s;ee that all my re&s;i&s;tance was in vain. He had me in his net: And d&mdash;n him, if he were not revenged for all the trouble I had given him. You keep no terms with me, my Byron, &s;aid he once; and d&mdash;n me, if I keep any with you!</P>
<P>I doubted not his malice: His Love had no tender|ne&s;s in it: But how could I think of being con&s;enting, as I may &s;ay, to &s;uch barbarous u&s;age, and by a man &s;o truly odious to me? What a &s;lave had I been in &s;pirit, could I have qualified on &s;uch villainous treatment as I had met with! or had I been able to de&s;ert my&s;elf!</P>
<P>At one place the chariot drove out of the road, over rough ways, and little hillocks, as I thought by its rocking; and then, it &s;topping, he let go my hands, and endeavoured to footh me. He begged I would be pacified, and offered, if I would forbear crying out for help, to leave my eyes unmuffled all the re&s;t of the way. But I would not, I told him, give &s;uch a &s;anc|tion to his barbarous violence.</P>
<P>On the chariot's &s;topping, one of his men came up, and put an handkerchief into his ma&s;ter's hands, in which were &s;ome cakes and &s;weet-meats; and gave him al&s;o a bottle of &s;ack, with a gla&s;s. Sir Hargrave was very urgent with me to take &s;ome of the &s;weet-meats, and to drink a gla&s;s of the wine: But I had neither &s;tomach nor will to touch either.</P>
<P>He eat him&s;elf very cordia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ly God forgive me, I wi&s;hed in my heart, there were pins and needles in every bit he put in his mouth.</P>
<P>He drank two gla&s;&s;es of the wine. Again he urged me. I &s;aid, I hoped I had cat and drank my la&s;t.</P>
<P>You have no dependence upon my honour, madam, &s;aid the villain; &s;o cannot be di&s;appointed mach, do what I will. Ungrateful, proud, vain, ob&s;tinate, he called me.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="238">
What &s;ignifies, &s;ays he, &s;hewing politene&s;s to a wo|man who has &s;hewn none to me, tho' &s;he was civil to every other man? Ha, ha, ha, hah! What, my &s;weet Byron, I don't hit your <HI>fancy! You don&punc;t like my morals!</HI> Laughing again. My lovely fly, &s;aid the in&s;ulting wretch, hugging me round in the cloak&punc; how prettily have I wrapped you about in my web!&mdash;</P>
<P>Such a provoking, low wretch!&mdash;I &s;truggled to free my&s;elf; and unhooked the curtain of the fore-gla&s;s: But he wrapt me about the clo&s;er, and &s;aid he would give me his garter for my girdle, if I would not &s;it &s;till, and be orderly. Ah. my charming Byron, &s;aid he, your opportunity is over&mdash;All your &s;truggles will not <HI>avail</HI> you&mdash;Will not <HI>avail</HI> you. That's a word of your own you know. I will, however, forgive you, if you promi&s;e to love me now. But if you &s;tay till I get you to the allotted place; then, madam, take what follows.</P>
<P>I &s;aw that I was upon a large, wild, heath-like place, between two roads, as it &s;eemed. I a&s;ked nothing about my journey's end. All I had to hope for as to an e&s;cape (tho' then I began to de&s;pair of it) was upon the road, or in &s;ome town. My journey's end, I knew, mu&s;t be the beginning of new dials; for I was re&s;olved to &s;uffer death, rather than to marry him. What I now was mo&s;t apprehen&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e about, was, of fail|ing into fits; and I an&s;wered to his barbarous in&s;ults as little as po&s;&s;ible, that I might not be provoked be|yond the little &s;trength I had left me.</P>
<P>Three or four times he offered to ki&s;s me; and cur&s;ed my pride for re&s;i&s;ting him; making him cla&s;p a cloud, was his &s;peech (aiming at wit) in&s;tead of his Juno; calling the cloak a cloud.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Byron, &s;aid he, if you will not come to a compromi&s;e with me, I mu&s;t dre&s;s you again for the journey. We will &s;top at a town a little further (beckoning to one of his men and on his ap|proaching, whi&s;pering to him, his whole body out of
<PB N="232" REF="239">
the chariot) and there you &s;hall alight; and a very worthy woman, to whom I &s;hall introduce you, will per&s;uade you, perhaps to take refre&s;hment, though I cannot.</P>
<P>You are a very barbarous man, Sir Hargrave. I have the misfortune to be in your power. You may dearly repent the u&s;age I have already received from you. You have made my life of no e&s;timation with me. I will not contend.</P>
<P>And tears ran down my cheeks. Indeed, I thought my heart was broke.</P>
<P>He wrapt me up clo&s;e, and tied the handkerchief about my mouth and head. I was quite pa&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>The chariot had not many minutes got into the great road again, over the like rough and &s;ometimes pla&s;hy ground, when it &s;topt on a di&s;pute be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ween the coachman, and the coachman of another chariot-and-&s;ix, as it proved.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave had but ju&s;t drawn my handkerchief clo&s;er to my eyes, when this happened. Hinder not my tears from flowing, &s;aid I; &s;truggling to keep my eyes free, the cloak enough muffling me, and the hand|kerchief being over my mouth; &s;o that my voice could be but ju&s;t heard by him, as I imagine.</P>
<P>He looked out of his chariot, to &s;ee the occa&s;ion of this &s;top; and then I found means to di&s;engage one hand.</P>
<P>I heard a gentleman's voice directing his own coach|man to give way.</P>
<P>I then pu&s;hed up the handkerchief with my di&s;en|gaged hand, from my mouth, and pulled it down from over my eyes, and cried out for help: Help for God's &s;ake.</P>
<P>A man&punc;s voice (it was my deliverer's, as it happily proved) bid Sir Hargrave's coachman proceed at his peril.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave, with terrible oaths and cur&s;es, ordered him to proceed, and to drive thro' all oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="240">
The gentleman called Sir Hargrave by his name; and charged him with being upon a bad de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The vile wretch &s;aid, he had only &s;ecur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d a runaway wife, eloped to, and intended to elope from, a ma&s;|querade, to her adultere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d!]: He put a&s;ide the cloak, and appealed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words"> dre&s;s.</P>
<P>I cried out, No, no, no, five or &s;ix times repeated; but could &s;ay no more at that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, holding up then both my di&s;engaged hands for protection.</P>
<P>The wicked man endeavoured to mu&s;&s;le me up again, and to force the handkerchief, which I had then got under my chin, over my mouth; and brutally cur&s;ed me.</P>
<P>The gentleman would not be &s;atisfied with Sir Har|grave's &s;tory. He would &s;peak to <HI>me.</HI> Sir Hargrave called him impertinent, and other names, and a&s;ked, Who the devil he was? with rage and contempt.&mdash;The gentleman, however, a&s;ked me, and with an air that promi&s;ed deliverance, if I were Sir Hargrave's wife.</P>
<P>No, no, no, no,&mdash;I could only &s;ay.</P>
<P>For my own part, I could have no &s;cruple, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as I was, and made de&s;perate, to throw my&s;elf into the protection, and even into the arms, of my deli|verer; tho' a very fine young gentleman. It would have been <HI>very</HI> hard, had I fallen from bad to bad; had the &s;acred name of protector been abu&s;ed by <HI>an|other</HI> Sir Hargrave, who, would have had the <HI>ad|ditional</HI> crime of betraying a confidence to an&s;wer for. But, however this had proved, an e&s;cape from the pre&s;ent evil was all I had in my head at the time.</P>
<P>But you may better conceive, than I can expre&s;s, the terror I was in, when Sir Hargrave drew his &s;word, and pu&s;hed at the gentleman with &s;uch words as de|noted (for I could not look that way) he had done him mi&s;chief. But when I found my oppre&s;&s;or, my low|meaning, and &s;oon after low-laid oppre&s;&s;or, pulled out of the chariot, by the brave, the gallant man (which
<PB N="234" REF="241">
was done with &s;uch force, as made the chariot rock) and my protector &s;afe; I was near fainting with joy, as before I had been with terror. I had &s;haken off the cloak, and united the handkerchief.</P>
<P>He carried me in his arms (I could not walk) to his own chariot.</P>
<P>I heard Sir Hargrave cur&s;e, &s;wear, and threaten. I was glad however, he was not dead.</P>
<P>Mind him not, madam, fear him not, &s;aid Sir Charles Grandi&s;on [You know his noble name, my Lucy&punc;] coachman, drive not over your ma&s;ter: Take care of your ma&s;ter; or &s;ome &s;uch words he &s;aid, as he lifted me into his own chariot. He came not in, but &s;hut the chariot-door, as &s;oon as he had &s;eated me.</P>
<P>He ju&s;t &s;urveyed, as it were, the &s;pot, and bid a &s;ervant let Sir Hargrave know who he was; and then came back to me.</P>
<P>Partly thro' terror, partly thro' weakne&s;s, I had &s;unk to the bottom of the chariot. He opened the door, entered, and, with all the tenderne&s;s of a brother, &s;oothed me, and lifted me on the &s;eat once more. He ordered his coachman to drive back to Colnebrooke. In accents of kindne&s;s, he told me, that he had there at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t virtuous and prudent of &s;i&s;ters, to who&s;e care he would commit me, and then proceed on his journey to town.</P>
<P>How irre&s;i&s;tably welcome to me was his &s;upporting arm, thrown round me, as we <HI>flew</HI> back, compared to that of the vile Sir Hargrave!</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves has given you an account, from the angelic &s;i&s;ter&mdash;O my Lucy, they are a pair of an|gels!</P>

Did I not find that my veneration of both is equal; did I not, on examination, find, that the amiable &s;i&s;ter is as dear to me, from her experi|enced tenderne&s;s, as her brother from his remembered bravery (which mu&s;t needs mingle awe with my e&s;teem); in &s;hort, that I love the &s;i&s;ter, and revere the brother; I &s;hould be afraid of my gratitude.</P>
<P>I have over-written my&s;elf. I am tired. O my grandmamma, you have never yet, while I have been in London, &s;ent me your over-valued ble&s;&s;ing under your own hand: Yet, I am &s;ure I had it; and <HI>your</HI> ble&s;&s;ings, my dear uncle and aunt Selby; and your prayers my Lucy, my Nancy, and all my Loves; el&s;e my deliverance had not perhaps followed my pre|&s;umptuous folly, in going dre&s;&s;ed out like the fanta&s;|tic wretch I appeared to be, at a vile, a fooli&s;h ma&s;|querade.&mdash;How often, throughout the &s;everal &s;tages of my di&s;tre&s;s, and even in my deliverance, did I turn my eye <HI>to</HI> my&s;elf, and <HI>from</HI> my&s;elf, with the di&s;gu&s;t that made a part, and that not a light one, of my puni&s;hment!</P>
<P>And &s;o much, my Lucy, for ma&s;querades, and ma&s;querade-dre&s;&s;es, for ever!</P>
<P>Pray let not any-body unnece&s;&s;arily be acquainted with this &s;hocking affair; particularly neither Mr. Gre|ville, nor Mr. Fenwick. It is very probable, that they (e&s;pecially Mr. Greville) would be for challenging Sir Hargrave, were it only on a &s;uppo&s;ition that it would give him an intere&s;t in me in the <HI>eye of the world.</HI> You know that Mr. Greville watches for all opportunities to give him&s;elf con&s;equence with me.</P>
<P>Were any farther mi&s;chief to happen to any-body, I &s;hould be grieved beyond mea&s;ure. Hitherto I have
<PB N="236" REF="243">
rea&s;on to think, that a tran&s;action &s;o &s;hocking is not very unhappily concluded. May the vile man &s;it him|&s;elf down &s;atisfied, and I &s;hall be willing to do &s;o too; provided I never more behold his face.</P>
<P>MR. Reeves will &s;end you with the above paccuet, a Letter from Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, inclo&s;ing one from that vile Wil&s;on. I can write no more ju&s;t now, and they will &s;ufficiently explain them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t Lucy. I need not &s;ay how much I am, and will ever be,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclo&s;ed long Letter is ju&s;t now brought to me. I pretend not to judge of the writer's peni|tence. Yet his confe&s;&s;ions &s;eem ingenuous; and he was not under any obligation to put them on paper.</P>
<P>As I pre&s;ume that you will not think it advi&s;eable to make the <HI>ineffectual</HI> attempt upon Mi&s;s Byron public by a pro&s;ecution, perhaps your conde&s;cending to let the man's &s;i&s;ter know, that her brother, if in earne&s;t, may &s;ecurely pur&s;ue the hone&s;t purpo&s;es he mentions, may &s;ave the poor wretch from taking &s;uch cour&s;es as might be fatal, not only to him&s;elf, but to innocent per&s;ons, who otherwi&s;e may &s;uffer by his being made de&s;perate.</P>
<P>The man, as you will &s;ee by his Letter, if you had not a &s;till <HI>&s;tronger</HI> proof, has abilities to do mi&s;chief. He has been in bad hands, as he tells us, from his youth upwards, or he might have been an u&s;eful mem|ber of &s;ociety. He is a young man; and if yet he could be made <HI>&s;o,</HI> his reformation will take from the
<PB N="237" REF="244">
number of the profligate, and add to that of the hope|ful; and who knows how wide the circle of his ac|quaintance is, and how many of them may be influ|enced by his example either way? If he marry the not-di&s;hone&s;t young woman, to whom he &s;eems to be contracted, may not your lenity be a means of &s;ecuring a whole future family on the &s;ide of moral hone&s;ty?</P>
<P>His crime, as the attempt was fru&s;trated, is not capital: And, not to metion the &s;ervice of &s;uch an evidence as this, &s;hould Sir Hargrave &s;eek for a legal redre&s;s, as he &s;ometimes weakly threatens, my hope makes me &s;ee a further good that may be brought about by this man's reformation: Wicked ma&s;ters cannot execute their ba&s;e views upon the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> of the innocent, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of wicked &s;ervants. What a ne&s;t of vipers may be cru&s;hed at once, or, at lea&s;t, rendered unhurtful, by depriving the three mon|&s;ters he names of the aid of &s;uch an agent? Men who want to &s;ave appearances, and have e&s;tates to forfeit, will &s;ometimes be hono&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, rather than put them&s;elves into the power of <HI>untried</HI> villains.</P>
<P>You will be &s;o good as to make my compliments to your Lady, and to <HI>our</HI> lovely ward. You &s;ee, Sir, that I join my&s;elf with you in the honour of that agreeable relation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. To the Honourable Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON,</HI> Bart.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Saturday, Feb. 18.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN what an odious light mu&s;t that wretch appear be|fore the worthie&s;t of men, who cannot but abhor him&s;elf!</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="245">
I am the unhappy man who was hired into the &s;er|vice of the be&s;t of young Ladies: Whom I was the means of betraying into the power of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen, from the Ball in the Hay-market on Thur&s;|day night la&s;t.</P>
<P>Your honour has made your&s;elf an <HI>intere&s;t</HI> in Mi&s;s Byron's fate, as I may &s;ay, by your powerful protec|tion. Pardon me if I give you &s;ome account of my|&s;elf, and of tran&s;actions which perhaps will otherwi&s;e never be known: And this in ju&s;tice to all round.</P>
<P>My parentage was hone&s;t: My education was above my parentage. I &s;et out with good principles: But I fell into a bad &s;ervice. I was young, and of a good natural di&s;po&s;ition; but had not virtue enough to re&s;i&s;t a temptation: I could not &s;ay No, to an unlawful thing, when my principles commanded my a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>I was, at <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;etting out, by favour of friends, taken as clerk to a merchant. In profe&s;s of time I tran&s;acted his bu&s;ine&s;s at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. He taught me to make light of oaths of office; and this by degrees made me think light of all moral obliga|tions, and laid the foundation of my ruin.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter's name was Bagenhall. He died; and I was to &s;eek. His brother &s;ucceeded to his fortune, which was very large: He was brought up to no bu|&s;ine&s;s: He was a gentleman: His &s;eat is near Read|ing. I was recommended by him to the &s;ervice of a gentleman who was nominated to go abroad on a fo|reign emba&s;&s;y. I will name his name, le&s;t your ho|nour &s;hould imagine I have any de&s;ign to evade the &s;tricte&s;t truth; Sir Chri&s;topher Lucas. I was to be this gentleman's ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e abroad.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ervice my new ma&s;ter employed me in, was to try to get for him the pretty daughter of an hone&s;t farmer.</P>
<P>I had been out of place for a twelvemonth. Had I had twenty &s;hillings aforehand in the world, I would, I think, have &s;aid No. Neverthele&s;s I con&s;ulted, in
<PB N="239" REF="246">
confidence, my late ma&s;ter's brother upon it. The advice he gave me was, not to boggle at it: But if, he &s;aid, I could manage the matter &s;o, as to cheat Sir Chri&s;topher, and get the girl for him, and keep the &s;ecret, he would give me 50 <HI>l.</HI> I abhorred the double treachery of young Mr. Bagenhall: But undertook to &s;erve Sir Chri&s;topher; and carried on a treaty with the farmer for his daughter; as if &s;he were to be the wife of Sir Chri&s;topher; but not to be owned till he re|turned from abroad; no, not even if &s;he &s;hould prove with child.</P>
<P>I found, in the cour&s;e of my vi&s;its at the farmer's, &s;o much hone&s;ty both in father and mother, and &s;o much innocence in the daughter, that my heart relented; and I took an opportunity to reveal Sir Chri&s;topher's ba&s;e de&s;ign to them; for the girl was de&s;igned to be ruined the very fir&s;t moment that Sir Chri&s;topher could be alone with her. Your honour may belive, that I injoined all three &s;trict &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s this contriving devil of a ma&s;ter found a way to get the young woman by other means; and, in amorous dalliance, &s;he told him to whom he was obliged for not &s;ucceeding before.</P>
<P>In rage he turned me out of his &s;ervice, in the mo&s;t di&s;graceful manner; but without giving any other rea&s;ons, than that he knew me to be a villain; and that I knew my&s;elf to be one: Nor would he give me a character: So I was quite reduced; and but for the kindne&s;s of a &s;i&s;ter, who keeps an inn in Smithfield, I &s;hould have &s;tarved, or been obliged to do wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have told your honour, that the poor farmer and his wife both died of grief in half a year. An ho|ne&s;t young man, who dearly loved the young woman, was found drowned &s;oon after: It is feared he was his own executioner. Sir Chri&s;topher went not on his emba&s;&s;y. His preparations for it, and his expen&s;ive way of life, before and after, reduced him: And he has been long a beggar, as I may &s;ay. The poor
<PB N="240" REF="247">
young woman is now, if living, on the town. I &s;aw her about half a year ago in St. Martin's Round-hou&s;e, taken up as a common pro&s;titute, and charged with picking a pocket. She was a pretty creature, and had a very pious turn, when I knew her fir&s;t. Her father had gone beyond him&s;elf in her education: And this was the fruit. What has &s;uch a man as Sir Chri&s;to|pher to an&s;wer for!&mdash;But it is come home to him. I re|joice that this wickedne&s;s was not added to my &s;core.</P>
<P>But heavy &s;cenes I had enough afterwards. Being utterly de&s;titute, except what my &s;i&s;ter did for me, and not enduring to be a burden to her, I threw my|&s;elf on my ma&s;ter Bagenhall. He employed me in mean offices, till his pander died (he is a very profli|gate man, Sir!); and then he <HI>promoted</HI> me to a <HI>&s;till meaner.</HI></P>
<P>In this way, I grew a &s;hamele&s;s contriver. He in|troduced me to Sir Hargrave Pollexfen, and to Mr. Merceda, a Portugu&s;e Jew. In the &s;ervice of the&s;e three ma&s;ters, good heaven forgive me! what villainies was I not the means of perpetrating! Yet I never was &s;o hardened, but I had temporary remor&s;es. But the&s;e three gentlemen would never let me re&s;t from wicked|ne&s;s: Yet they kept me poor and nece&s;&s;itous, as the only means to keep me what they called <HI>hone&s;t;</HI> for they had often rea&s;on to think, that had I had any other means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, I would have been <HI>really</HI> hone&s;t.</P>
<P>I was now Mr. Bagenhall's con&s;tant &s;ervant. Sir Hargrave and Mr. Merceda u&s;ed to borrow me: But I mu&s;t &s;ay Sir Hargrave is an innocent man to the other two. They care&s;&s;ed me, I &s;peak it to my &s;hame, as a man fit for their turn. I had contrivance; tem|per; I knew &s;omething of every-body. But my &s;i&s;ter knows my frequent compunctions; and that I hated the vile cour&s;e I was in. She u&s;ed to lecture me enough. She is a good woman.</P>
<P>Will your honour have patience with me a little longer?</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="248">
Sir Hargrave on the &s;eventh of this month came to my ma&s;ter Bagenhall at Reading, with whom he had double bu&s;ine&s;s: One was to take a bond and judg|ment of him (Sir Hargrave is no better than an u&s;urer): Mr. Bagenhall has lived a mo&s;t extravagant life: The other was to borrow me. Mr. Merceda had a &s;cheme on foot at the &s;ame time, which he was earne&s;t to engage me in; but it was too &s;hocking; and Mr. Ba|genhall came into Sir Hargrave's.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave told them, he de&s;igned nothing <HI>more</HI> than a <HI>violation,</HI> if he could get my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of the mo&s;t beautiful woman in the world. And, Sir, to &s;ee the villainy of the other two; they both, unknown to each other, made propo&s;als to me, to trick Sir Hargrave, and to get the Lady, each for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But to <HI>me,</HI> Sir Hargave &s;wore, that he was fully r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;olved to leave this wicked cour&s;e of life. Bagen|hall and Merceda, he &s;aid, were devils; and he would marry, and have no more to &s;ay to them. All that was in his view was hone&s;t marriage. He &s;aid he had never been in the Lady's company but once, and that was the day before at Lady Betty Williams's. He &s;aid he went thither, knowing &s;he was to be there; for having for &s;ome time had it in his head to marry, this was the Lady he had pitch'd upon in his mind, from the character he had of her from every mouth at the Northampton races.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid he, I &s;hall have &s;ome difficulty to ob|tain her, notwith&s;tanding my fortune is &s;o great; for every one who &s;ees her is in love with her: And he named &s;everal gentlemen who laid clo&s;e &s;iege to her.</P>
<P>She brought a &s;ervant up with her, &s;aid he, who hones after the country, and is actually gone, or &s;oon will. Her cou&s;in enquires of every one after a proper &s;er|vant for her. You, Wil&s;on, &s;aid he, are hand&s;ome and genteel: He was plea&s;ed to &s;ay &s;o. You have a mode&s;t humble look: You know all the duties of a &s;ervant: Get your&s;elf entertain'd, and your fortune is
<PB N="242" REF="249">
made for life, if by your means I obtain the Lady. I have already tender'd my&s;elf, &s;aid he. Perhaps &s;he will have me in a few days. I don't expect to be de|nied, if &s;he be di&s;engaged, as it is &s;aid &s;he is. If you can get into her &s;ervice, you will find out every thing. This is all that is to be done: But you mu&s;t never mention my name, nor ever know any-thing of me, as I go and come.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave declared, that his heart was <HI>burnt up</HI> with the Love of the Lady: And if he &s;ucceeded (as he had little doubt even without my help, had I been ac|tually in Merceda's &s;ervice) you will, &s;aid he, as my Lady's &s;ervant, be mine of cour&s;e; you &s;hall never wear a livery; and you &s;hall be my gentleman, till I can get a place for you in the Cu&s;toms. This, may it plea&s;e your honour, he knew I had long aimed at, and it had been often promi&s;ed by him&s;elf, and my other two ma&s;ters; and was their fir&s;t promi&s;e when they wanted to engage me in any of their &s;chemes; tho' they never thought more of it when the &s;ervice was over. If I got but my&s;elf engaged, I was, on the day I entered into my Lady's &s;ervice, to have as an earne&s;t ten guineas.</P>
<P>Encouraged by &s;uch promi&s;es, (and the project be|ing an hone&s;ter one than ever Sir Hargrave, or either of the other two, had &s;ought to engage me in) I of|fered my &s;ervice to my Lady; and, on Mr. Bagen|hall's writing a good character of me, was accepted.</P>
<P>I could have been happy in the &s;ervice of this Lady, all the days of my life. She is all goodne&s;s: All the &s;ervants, every-body, gentle and &s;imple, adored her: But &s;he, unexpectedly, refu&s;ing to have Sir Hargrave, and he being afraid that one of her three or four Lovers would <HI>cut him out,</HI> he re&s;olved to take more violent mea&s;ures than he had at fir&s;t intended.</P>
<P>If any man was ever mad in Love, it was Sir Hargrave. But then he was as mad with anger to be refu&s;ed. Sir Hargrave was ever thought to be one of the proude&s;t
<PB N="243" REF="250">
men in England: And he complained that my lady u&s;ed him wor&s;e than &s;he did any-body el&s;e. But it was not <HI>her</HI> way to u&s;e any-body ill, I &s;aw that.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s he was re&s;olved to &s;trike a <HI>bold &s;troke for a wife,</HI> as were his words from the title of a play: And between us we &s;ettled the matter in one night: For I had found means to get out unknown to the family.</P>
<P>It will be tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing too much upon your honour's patience, to be very particular in our contrivances. I will be as brief as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>My Lady was to go to a Ma&s;querade. I got into the knowledge of every thing how and about it. The maids were as full of the matter as their ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>It was agreed to make the chairmen fuddled. Two of <HI>Mr. Merceda's footmen</HI> were to undertake the ta&s;k. Brandy was put into their liquor to ha&s;ten them.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon overcome. The weather was cold: They drank bri&s;kly, and were laid up &s;afe. I then hired two chance chairmen and gave them orders as had been contrived.</P>
<P>I had twenty guineas given me in hand for my en|couragement; in which were included the promi&s;ed ten.</P>
<P>I had, when I was my fir&s;t ma&s;ter Bagenhall's clerk, made acquaintance with &s;everal clerks of the Cu&s;tum|hou&s;e, particularly with one Awberry, a &s;ober mode&s;t man; who has two &s;i&s;ters; to one of whom I am con|tracted, and always for two years pa&s;t, intended to make my wife, as &s;oon as I &s;hould be in any way to maintain her. The mother is a widow. All of them are very hone&s;t people.</P>
<P>Mr. Awberry the brother being a&s;&s;ured by me (and I was well a&s;&s;ured of it my&s;elf, and had no doubt about it) that marriage was intended; and knowing Sir Hargrave's great e&s;tate (and having indeed &s;een Sir Hargrave on the occa&s;ion, and received his prote&s;ta|tions
<PB N="244" REF="251">
of honour) engaged his mother and &s;i&s;ter in it; and the re&s;ult, as to them and me, was, that I was to receive, as &s;oon as the knot was tied, an hundred guineas be&s;ides the twenty; and moreover an ab&s;olute promi&s;e of a place; and twenty pounds a year till I got it; and then my marriage with young Mrs. Aw|berry was to follow.</P>
<P>The widow has an annuity of thirty pounds, which, with their &s;on's &s;alary, keeps them above want.</P>
<P>She lives at Paddington. There is a back-door and garden, as it happens, convenient to bring any-body in, or carry any-body out, &s;ecretly; and hither it was re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, that the lady &s;hould be brought, and a Fleet par&s;on and his clerk ready &s;tation'd, to per|form the ceremony; and then all that the bridegroom wi&s;h'd was to follow of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave doubted not (tho' he was fruitful in contrivances, and put many others in practice) but he &s;hould be detected if he carried the Lady to his own hou&s;e. And as he was afraid that the chairmen (not|with&s;tanding &s;everal other artful contrivances) would be able to find out the place they carried her to, he had ordered his chariot-and-&s;ix to be at the widow Awberry's by &s;ix in the morning, with three &s;ervants on hor&s;eback, armed, and a hor&s;e and pi&s;tols be&s;ides. After marriage and con&s;ummation, he was re&s;olved to go to his hou&s;e on the fore&s;t, but not to &s;tay there; but to go to Mr. Merceda's hou&s;e near Newberry, where he doubted not but he &s;hould be &s;ecret till he thought fit to produce the lady, as Lady Pollexfen: And often, very often, did he triumph on the victory he &s;hould obtain over her other Lovers, and over her own proud heart, as he would have it to be.</P>
<P>The par&s;on, Sir, came: The clerk was there: But what with fits, prayers, tears, and one thing or other (at one time the Lady being thought irrecover|able having received &s;ome unintended hurt in her &s;truggling to get out of a door, as I heard it was) Sir
<PB N="245" REF="252">
Hargrave in terror di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the par&s;on; and re&s;olved to carry the lady (who by that time was recovered) in the chariot to his &s;eat at Wind&s;or; and then, &s;tay|ing there only to marry, go to Newberry: And from thence break out by degrees, as the matter &s;hould be taken.</P>
<P>My lady &s;creamed, re&s;i&s;ted, and did all that woman could do, to get free: And more than once people who heard her cry out for help were put on a wrong &s;cent: And had we not met with your honour (who would &s;ee with your own eyes, and hear with your own ears) the affair had been all over in the way Sir Hargrave wi&s;hed, and was at &s;o much pains and ex|pence to effect. For, Sir, the chariot generally drove &s;o fa&s;t, that before pa&s;&s;engers could have <HI>re&s;olved</HI> whe|ther to interfere or not, we &s;hould have been out of &s;ight or reach.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave is in the greate&s;t rage with us all, be|cau&s;e we &s;tood not better by him. He refu&s;es any fa|vour to me, and threatens to pi&s;tol me the moment he &s;ees me. That's to be my reward.</P>
<P>We were four at &s;etting out from Paddington; but one of the &s;ervants was di&s;patch'd to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s an old &s;ervant of Sir Hargrave's mother, at Colnebrooke, who keeps there a kind of haberda&s;hery &s;hop; and where he propo&s;ed to get &s;ome refre&s;hment for the lady, if he could make her take any. For my part I wonder how &s;he kept out of fits on the road. She had enow of them at Paddington.</P>
<P>The two &s;ervants who &s;taid about Sir Hargrave, are di&s;charged with all the marks of indignation that a ma&s;ter incen&s;ed by &s;uch a di&s;appointment could ex|pre&s;s; and, as I &s;aid before, he is re&s;olved to pi&s;tol me the moment he &s;ees me. Yet I too well &s;erved him for the peace of my con&s;cience.</P>
<P>A coach-and-four was ordered to carry the widow and her two daughters to Reading, to the New-Inn there, where they were to re&s;ide for a week or &s;o, till
<PB N="246" REF="253">
all was blown over; and that they might be out of the way of an&s;wering que&s;tions: And my <HI>brother</HI> Awberry, as I call him, and hope to make him (for he is a very hone&s;t man) was to go to them there.</P>
<P>And there, in all probability, had Sir Hargrave &s;uc|ceeded, and been as good as his word, &s;hould I have been the hu&s;band of as tender-hearted a young wo|man as any in the pari&s;h &s;he lives in.</P>
<P>Here is a very long letter, may it plea&s;e you, Sir. I have &s;hortened it however as much as I could: But in hatred to my&s;elf, and the vile ways I have, by exce&s;s of good-nature, and by meeting with wicked ma&s;ters, been drawn into&mdash;For the clearing of my &s;i&s;ter's cha|racter, who lives in credit among her neighbours, and of every other per&s;on who might otherwi&s;e have been &s;u&s;pected&mdash;In ju&s;tice to Mrs. Awberry's, and her two daughters, and her &s;on's characters&mdash;And in ju&s;tice <HI>&s;o far</HI> to Sir Hargrave's, as that he intended marriage (and had he <HI>not,</HI> he would have found no friends in his de&s;igns at Paddington) and &s;o far as to clear him of having not offered the lea&s;t incivility to my lady&mdash;[Had he intended, or been provoked &s;o to do, he was too well watch'd by the widow, and her daugh|ters, to have been permitted; and that by my own re|que&s;t, which was, that they &s;hould be ready to run in whenever they heard her cry out, and that they would not leave Sir Hargrave alone with my Lady for &s;ix mi|nutes, till their hands were joined in wedlock]&mdash;In ju&s;tice I &s;ay to all the&s;e per&s;ons, I thought proper thus to give you, Sir, all that I knew relating to this wicked tran&s;action. And if, may it plea&s;e your ho|nour, I were to be taken up, I could &s;ay no more be|fore a magi&s;trate; except this, which I had like to have forgot; which is, that had it not been for me, &s;ome mi&s;chief might have been done, between Sir Hargrave's &s;ervants and yours, if not to your honour's per&s;on.</P>
<P>All that I mo&s;t humbly beg, is, the pardon of &s;o
<PB N="247" REF="254">
&s;weet a lady. I have cho&s;en, ever-to-be-honoured Sir, to write to you, who&s;e goodne&s;s is &s;o generally talk'd of, and who have &s;o nobly redeemed and protected her. Mr. Reeves, I know, has &s;uffered too much in his mind to forgive me. He is a worthy gentleman. I am &s;orry for the di&s;turbance I have given him. I have hopes given me, that I &s;hall get employment on the Keys, or as a tide-waiter extraordinary.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e the Lord, I will never, never more, be the tool of wicked ma&s;ters. All I wi&s;h for is, to be able to do ju&s;tice to the love of an hone&s;t young woman; and I am re&s;olved, whether &s;o enabled or not, to &s;tarve, rather than to go any more, no, not for a &s;ingle hour, into the &s;ervice of the iniquitous gentle|men I have &s;o often named in this long Letter.</P>
<P>If I might be a&s;&s;ured, that I may pur&s;ue unmole&s;t|ed, any hone&s;t calling, &s;o as that I may not be tempted or driven into unhappy cour&s;es, my heart would be at re&s;t.</P>
<P>There might have been murder in this affair: That &s;hocks me to think of. O Sir, good, excellent, brave, and the mo&s;t worthy of gentlemen, you have given to <HI>me</HI> as great a deliverance, as you have to the <HI>lady:</HI> Yea, greater; for mine may be a deliverance, if I make a proper u&s;e of it, of &s;oul as well as body.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>SELBY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, Feb. 24.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY cou&s;in Reeves has given a&s;&s;urance to the &s;i&s;ter of that Wil&s;on, that he may, unmole&s;ted by any of us, pur&s;ue the be&s;t means he can fall upon for the obtaining of an hone&s;t livelihood.</P>
<P>In every-thing it is determined to follow the advice of my deliverer.</P>
<P>What a letter is that fellow's! What men are there in the world!</P>
<P>Of &s;uch we have read: But I hoped, that I might have e&s;caped &s;uffering by any &s;uch.</P>
<P>We are extremely di&s;turbed at the fellow's po&s;t|&s;cript; and the more, as we are told by &s;everal peo|ple, that Sir Hargrave will not &s;it down quietly; but threatens vengeance upon Sir Charles. I wi&s;h I had not come to London.</P>
<P>I hope my grandmamma's &s;pirits are not affected by what &s;he knows of the matter. It was very good of my aunt Selby to take the mea&s;ures &s;he did, in &s;often|ing every circum&s;tance, and not to let her know any|thing till the danger was over. But indeed it was but the natural effect of that prudence which regulates all the actions of my honour'd aunt.</P>
<P>My grandmamma has &s;uch &s;trength of mind, that now &s;he knows I am &s;afe, and not unhappy, I dare &s;ay &s;he will by degrees bear to hear my <HI>narrations</HI> read. She will be more unea&s;y if &s;he thinks any-thing is kept from her.</P>
<P>Yet I know that her tenderne&s;s and her love for her Harriet will co&s;t her &s;ome angui&s;h, &s;ome &s;ighs, &s;ome tears, as &s;he reads, or hears read, the cruelty her girl has been treated with: Who, &s;o tenderly brought up, &s;o greatly indulg'd, never before knew what har&s;h|ne&s;s
<PB N="249" REF="256">
was, and had only read of the words <HI>cruelty, bar|barity,</HI> and &s;uch-like words. But then &s;he will have more joy I hope, in my deliverance than &s;he will have pain in my &s;ufferings. And pray let her know, that I am every day le&s;s and le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the pain in my &s;tomach, of which I was &s;o apprehen&s;ive, as really at the time to think it a mortal blow. My grandmamma has told us girls, you know, my Lucy, twenty and twenty frightful &s;tories of the vile enterprizes of men, again&s;t innocent creatures; and will therefore call to mind &s;tories which have concluded much wor&s;e than, ble&s;&s;ed be God, mine has done.</P>
<P>JUST now I have received a congratulatory pacquet of Letters:</P>
<P>One from my aunt Selby, &s;uch a &s;weetly kind, &s;uch a truly maternal Letter!</P>
<P>One from my deare&s;t grandmamma. I will put it next my heart, whenever I feel there any of that pain, of which &s;he is &s;o kindly apprehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>One from Nancy&mdash;Dear girl!&mdash;She is very, very generous to forget her own malady to condole and con|gratulate me. Your brother James, my Lucy, has written me a very kind Letter. He is a good young man: God keep him &s;o! What a mi&s;chievous crea|ture is a bad man!</P>
<P>I have a charming Letter, by the po&s;t, from my god|father Deane: He has heard nothing of what has hap|pened; and I am &s;ure is too &s;ollicitous for my welfare, to take it well, if I do not let him know &s;omething about it: I will therefore &s;oon write to him.</P>
<P>But <HI>your</HI> Letter, my Lucy!&mdash;What, I warrant, you thought I had forgot <HI>your</HI> Letter in the enumerati|on of the contents of the precious pacquet! If I <HI>had,</HI> your goodne&s;s, your love, might have made you for|give me: But I never would have forgiven my&s;elf.</P>
<P>But you and I, my dear, write for all to &s;ee what we write: And &s;o I re&s;erved yours to be la&s;t-mention'd.
<PB N="250" REF="257">
Only I &s;lid in my godfather Deane's between; not be|cau&s;e I love him better than I do my Lucy&mdash;No, that is impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;But becau&s;e I had a mind to &s;hew you, that I was ha&s;tening to be quite well, and &s;o a&s;&s;umed my little &s;aucy tricks, and &s;urprizes, as if it were <HI>po&s;&s;i|ble</HI> for me to be heedle&s;s, where my love to my Lucy was in the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>And &s;o you expect the particular character and de|&s;cription of the per&s;ons of this more than amiable brother and &s;i&s;ter. Need you to have told me that you do? And could you think that after having wa&s;ted &s;o many quires of paper in giving you the characters of people, many of whom de&s;erved not to be drawn out from the common croud of mortals, I would forbear to give you tho&s;e of per&s;ons who adorn the age in which they live, and even human nature?</P>
<P>You don't que&s;tion, you &s;ay, if I begin in their prai&s;es, but my gratitude will make me write in a <HI>&s;ub|lime &s;tile;</HI> &s;o you phrai&s;e it; and are ready, you pro|mi&s;e me, to take with allowance, all the fine things from me, which Mr. Reeves has already taught you to expect.</P>
<P>You may be right, in your expectations, as far as I know; for my grandfather (&s;o many years ago) u&s;ed to &s;ay, that his little Byron was an enthu&s;ia&s;t in her gratitude. But, however, when I &s;ay any-thing of the exalted minds, of the expanded hearts, of the amia|able manners, of this happy brother and &s;i&s;ter, which &s;eems to exceed, in my prai&s;es, the bounds you will all be willing to &s;et me, then let the over flowings be car|ried to account of the <HI>grateful</HI> enthu&s;ia&s;m, and <HI>only</HI> to that.</P>
<P>Which &s;hall I begin with? You will have a &s;harp look-out upon me, you &s;ay: Ah, my Lucy! I know what you mean. But I am &s;afe from every-thing but my gratitude, I will a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>And &s;o, if I begin with the character of the Bro|ther, then will you join with my uncle, &s;hake your
<PB N="251" REF="258">
head, and cry, Ah! my Harriet! If I begin with the &s;i&s;ter, will you not &s;ay, that I &s;ave my choice&s;t &s;ub|ject for the la&s;t? How difficult is it to avoid cen&s;ure, when there is a re&s;olution taken to be cen&s;orious!</P>
<P>Well, but keep a <HI>look-out,</HI> if you plea&s;e, my Lucy: Not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of re&s;erve &s;hall it give to my heart: My pen &s;hall be hone&s;t to that heart; and I &s;hall be benefited, I am &s;ure, by the <HI>faithful wounds</HI> of &s;uch affectionate, and equally-beloved as revered <HI>friends</HI>&mdash;And &s;o, Pen, take thy cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on&mdash;Yes, my volant, my &s;elf-conduct|ed quill, begin with the &s;i&s;ter, &s;ay my Lucy what &s;he plea&s;es&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on is about twenty-four: Of a fine &s;ta|ture: She has dignity in her a&s;pect; and a very pene|trating black eye, with which &s;he does what &s;he plea|&s;es: Her hair is black, very fine, and naturally curls: She is not fair, but her complexion is delicate and clear, and promi&s;es a long duration to her loveline&s;s: Her features are generally regular: Her no&s;e is a little aquiline; but that is &s;o far from being a blemi&s;h, that it gives a kind of maje&s;ty to her other features: Her teeth are white and even: Her mouth is perfectly lovely; and a mode&s;t archne&s;s appears in her &s;miles, that makes one both love and fear her, when &s;he begins to &s;peak. She is finely &s;haped; and, in her air and whole appearance, perfectly genteel.</P>
<P>She her&s;elf &s;ays, That before her brother came to England, &s;he was thought to be proud, pert, and lof|ty: But I hardly believe her; for the man lives not, it is my belief, who in fourteen months time (and Sir Charles has not been longer arrived) could &s;o totally eradicate tho&s;e qualities in a mind of which they had taken&punc;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as that they &s;hould not occa&s;ionally &s;hew them&s;elves.</P>
<P>She has charming &s;pirits. I dare &s;ay, &s;he &s;ings well, from the air &s;he now-and-then warbles in the gaiety of her heart, as &s;he goes up and down &s;tairs: She is
<PB N="252" REF="259">
very polite; yet has a vein of raillery, that were &s;he <HI>not</HI> polite, would give one too much apprehen&s;ion for one's ea&s;e: But I am &s;ure &s;he is frank, ea&s;y, and good-humoured: And, by turning over all the ju&s;t and hand&s;ome things which are attributed to her&s;elf, to her brother's credit, &s;he mu&s;t be equally humble and generous.</P>
<P>She &s;ays, &s;he has but lately taken a very great like|ing to reading: But I am ready to que&s;tion what &s;he &s;ays, when &s;he &s;peaks any-thing that &s;ome would con|&s;true to her di&s;advantage. She pretends, that &s;he was too volatile, too gay, too airy, to be confined to &s;e|dentary amu&s;ements. Her father, however, accord|ing to the genteele&s;t and mo&s;t laudable modern educa|tion for women, had given her a ma&s;ter, who taught her Hi&s;tory and Geography; in both which &s;he <HI>acknow|ledges</HI> &s;he made &s;ome progre&s;s. In Mu&s;ic, &s;he <HI>owns</HI> &s;he has &s;kill: But I am told by her maid who attended me by her young Lady's direction, and who delights to prai&s;e her mi&s;tre&s;s, that &s;he reads and &s;peaks French and Italian; that &s;he writes finely, and is greatly ad|mired for her wit, prudence, and obligingne&s;s. No|body, &s;aid Jenny (who is a &s;en&s;ible young woman a clergyman's daughter, well educated, and very oblige|ing) can &s;tand again&s;t her good-natured raillery: Her brother, &s;he &s;ays, is not &s;pared: But he takes delight in her vivacity, and gives way to it; when it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that he could take her down, if he plea&s;ed. And then, added this good young woman, &s;he is an excellent manager in a family, finely as &s;he is edu|cated [I rejoiced to hear that, for the honour of our reading Ladies, as in Mi&s;s Clements's ca&s;e]: She knows every-thing, and how to direct what &s;hould be done, from the private family-dinner, to a &s;umptuous entertainment: And every day in&s;pects, and approves, or alters, the bill of fare: By the way, my Lucy, &s;he is an early ri&s;er&mdash;Do you mind that? And &s;o can do every-thing with ea&s;e, plea&s;ure, and without hurry
<PB N="253" REF="260">
and confu&s;ion: For all her &s;ervants are early ri&s;ers of cour&s;e. What &s;ervants can for &s;hame be in bed, at a rea&s;onable hour to be up, when they have a ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s's example for early ri&s;ing?</P>
<P>Yet this fine Lady loves to go to the public places, and often goes, and makes a brilliant figure there. She has time for them, and earns her plea&s;ures by her early ri&s;ing?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, Jenny tells me, has two humble &s;ervants [I wonder &s;he has not two-and-twenty]: One is Sir Walter Watkyns, a man of a large e&s;tate in So|mer&s;et&s;hire; the other is Lord G. &s;on of the Earl of G.; but neither of them highly approved by her: Yet Jenny &s;ays, they are both of them hand&s;ome men, and admired by the Ladies: This makes me afraid, that they are modern men; and pay their court by the exterior appearance, rather than by interior worth. Who, my Lucy, that has heard what my late grand|father has &s;aid, and my grandmamma &s;till &s;ays, of the men in their youthful days, will not &s;ay, that we have our lots ca&s;t in an age of Petits Maitres, and In|&s;ignificants.</P>
<P>Such an amiable woman is Mi&s;s Charlotte Grandi|&s;on&mdash;May I be found, on further acquaintance, but half as lovely in her eyes, as &s;he is in mine!&mdash;Don't be jealous, Lucy, I hope I have a large heart. I hope there is room in it for half a dozen &s;weet female friends!&mdash;Yes, altho' another Love were to intervene. I could not bear, that even the affection due to the man of my choice, were I to marry, &s;hould, like Aaron's rod, &s;wallow up all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But now for her brother&mdash;My deliverer!</P>
<P>But pray now, Lucy, don't you come with your &s;harp <HI>look-out:</HI> I warrant you will expect on this oc|ca&s;ion to read the tumults of the poor girl's heart in her character and de&s;cription of a man, to whom &s;he is &s;o much obliged!&mdash;But what if &s;he di&s;appoints you, and yet do ju&s;tice to his manifold excellencies?
<PB N="254" REF="261">
What if &s;he find &s;ome faults in him, that his &s;i&s;ter has not?</P>
<P>Parading Harriet, methinks you &s;ay! Teazing girl! Go on, go on, leave it to <HI>us</HI> to find you out: And take care that the very faults you pretend to di&s;cover, do not pa&s;s for a colour only, and lead to your de|tection.</P>
<P>Thank you, Lucy, for your caution: But I will not be obliged to it. My pen &s;hall follow the dictates of my heart; and if it be as hone&s;t to me, as I think it is to every-body el&s;e, I hope I have nothing to fear either from <HI>your</HI> look-out, or, which is &s;till a &s;harper, my uncle Selby's.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, in his per&s;on, is really a very fine man. He is tall; rather &s;lender than full: His face in &s;hape is a fine oval: He &s;eems to have florid health; health confirmed by exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>His complexion &s;eems to have been naturally too fine for a man: But as if he were above being regard|ful of it, his face is over&s;pread with a manly &s;unnine&s;s [I want a word] that &s;hews he has been in warmer climates than England: And &s;o it &s;eems he has; &s;ince the Tour of Europe has not contented him. He has vi&s;ited &s;ome parts of A&s;ia, and even of Afric, Egypt particularly.</P>
<P>I wonder what bu&s;ine&s;s a <HI>man</HI> has for &s;uch fine teeth, and &s;o fine a mouth, as Sir Charles Grandi&s;on might boa&s;t of, were he vain.</P>
<P>In his a&s;pect there is &s;omething great and noble, that &s;hews him to be of rank. Were kings to be cho&s;en for beauty and maje&s;ty of per&s;on, Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on would have few competitors. His eye&mdash;Indeed, my Lucy, his eye &s;hews, if po&s;&s;ible, more of &s;parkling intelligence than that of his &s;i&s;ter&mdash;</P>
<P>Now pray be quiet, my dear uncle Selby! What is beauty in a man to me? You all know that I never thought beauty a qualification in a man.</P>
<P>And yet, this grandeur in his per&s;on and air is ac|companied
<PB N="255" REF="262">
companied with &s;o much ea&s;e and freedom of man|ners, as engages one's love with one's reverence. His good breeding renders him very acce&s;&s;ible. His &s;i&s;ter &s;ays, he is always the fir&s;t to break thro' the re&s;traints, and to bani&s;h the diffidences, that will generally at|tend per&s;ons on a quite new acquaintance. He <HI>may,</HI> for he is &s;ure of being acceptable in whatever he does or &s;ays.</P>
<P>Very true, Lucy: Shake your head if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In a word, he has &s;uch an ea&s;y, yet manly polite|ne&s;s, as well in his dre&s;s, as in his addre&s;s (no &s;ingu|larity appearing in either) that were he <HI>not</HI> a fine figure of a man, but were even plain and hard-featured, he would be thought (what is far more eligible in a man, than mere beauty) very agreeable.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, my dear, has travelled we may &s;ay, to &s;ome purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Well might his &s;i&s;ter tell Mr. Reeves, that when|ever he married, he would break half a &s;core hearts.</P>
<P>Upon my word Lucy, he has too many per&s;onal ad|vantages for a woman who loved him with <HI>peculiarity,</HI> to be ea&s;y with, whatever may be <HI>his</HI> virtue, from the foible our &s;ex in general love to indulge for hand|&s;ome men. For, O my dear, womens eyes are &s;ad giddy things; and will run away with their &s;en&s;e, with their under&s;tandings, beyond the power of being over|taken either by &s;top theif, or hue-and-cry.</P>
<P>I know that here you will bid me take care not to increa&s;e the number of the giddy. And &s;o I will, my Lucy.</P>
<P>The good &s;en&s;e of this real fine gentleman is not, as I can find, ru&s;ted over by &s;ourne&s;s, by moro&s;ene&s;s: He is above quarreling with the world for trifles: But he is &s;till more above making &s;uch compliances with it, as would impeach either his honour or con&s;cience. Once Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;peaking of her brother, &s;aid, My brother is valued by tho&s;e who know him be&s;t, not &s;o much for being an hand&s;ome man; not &s;o
<PB N="256" REF="263">
much for his birth and fortune; nor for this or that &s;ingle worthine&s;s; as for being, in the great and yet comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the word, a <HI>good man.</HI> And at another time &s;he &s;aid, that he lived to him&s;elf, and to his own heart; and that tho' he had the happine&s;s to plea&s;e every-body, yet he made the judgement or approbation of the world matter but of &s;econd con&s;i|deration. In a word, added &s;he, Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on, my <HI>Brother</HI> (and when &s;he looks proud, it is when &s;he &s;ays, <HI>my Brother)</HI> is not to be mi&s;led either by fal&s;e glory, or fal&s;e &s;hame, which he calls, The great &s;nares of virtue.</P>
<P>What a man is this, &s;o to act!&mdash;What a woman is this, &s;o to di&s;tingui&s;h her brother's excellencies!</P>
<P>What a poor creature am I, compared to either of them! And yet I have had my admirers. So perhaps may &s;till more faulty creatures among their inferiors. If, my Lucy, we have &s;o much good &s;en&s;e as to make fair compari&s;ons, what have we to do but to look for|ward rather than backward, in order to obtain the grace of humility?</P>
<P>But let me tell you, my dear, that Sir Charles does not <HI>look</HI> to be &s;o great a &s;elf-denier, as his &s;i&s;ter &s;eems to think him, when &s;he &s;ays, he lives to him&s;elf, and to his own heart, rather than to the opinion of the world.</P>
<P>He dre&s;&s;es to the fa&s;hion, rather richly, 'tis true, than gaudily; but &s;till richly: So that he gives his fine per&s;on its full con&s;ideration. He has a great deal of vivacity in his whole a&s;pect; as well as in his eye. Mrs. Jenny &s;ays, that he is a great admirer of hand|&s;ome women. His equipage is perfectly in ta&s;te, tho' not &s;o much to the glare of ta&s;te, as if he aimed either to in&s;pire or &s;hew emulation. He &s;eldom travels with|out a &s;et, and &s;uitable attendants; and, what I think &s;eems a little to favour of &s;ingularity, his hor&s;es are not docked: Their tails are only tied up when they are on the road. This I took notice of when we came
<PB N="257" REF="264">
to town. I want, methinks, my dear, to find &s;ome fault in his outward appearance, were it but to make you think me impartial; my gratitude to him, and my veneration for him, notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But if he be of opinion that the tails of the&s;e noble animals are not only a natural ornament, but are of real u&s;e to defend them from the vexatious in&s;ects that in &s;ummer are &s;o apt to annoy them (as Jenny ju&s;t now told me was thought to be his rea&s;on for not de|priving his cattle of a defence, which nature gave them) how far from a di&s;prai&s;e is this humane con&s;ideration! And how, in the more minute, as well as we may &s;up|po&s;e in the greater in&s;tances, does he de&s;erve the cha|racter of the man of mercy, who will be merciful to his bea&s;t!</P>
<P>I have met with per&s;ons, who call tho&s;e men <HI>good,</HI> that yet allow them&s;elves in liberties which no good man can take. But I dare &s;ay, that Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on means by <HI>good,</HI> when &s;he calls her brother, with &s;o much pride, <HI>a good man,</HI> what I, and what you, my Lucy, would under&s;tand by the word.</P>
<P>With &s;o much &s;pirit, life, and gallantry in the fir&s;t appearance of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, you may &s;up|po&s;e, that had I not been &s;o dreadfully terrified and ill|u&s;ed, and &s;o ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive of wor&s;e treatment; and had I been offered another protection; I &s;hould hardly have acted the frighted bird flying from the hawk, to which, as Mr. Reeves tells me, Sir Charles (tho' politely, and kindly enough, yet too &s;en&s;ibly for my recollection) compared me.</P>
<P>Do you wonder, Lucy, that I cannot hold up my head, when I recollect the figure I mu&s;t make in that odious Ma&s;querade-habit, hanging by my cla&s;ping arms about the neck of &s;uch a young gentleman? Can I be more effectually humbled than by &s;uch a re|collection? And yet is not this an in&s;tance of that <HI>fal&s;e &s;hame</HI> in me, to which Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is &s;o greatly &s;uperior?</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="265">
Surely, &s;urely, I have <HI>had</HI> my puni&s;hment for <HI>my</HI> compliances with this fooli&s;h world. Fal&s;e glory, and fal&s;e &s;hame, the poor Harriet has never been totally above. Why was I &s;o much indulged? Why was I allowed to &s;top &s;o many miles &s;hort of my journey&punc;s end, and then complimented, as if I had no farther to go?&mdash;but &s;urely, I was pa&s;t all <HI>&s;hame,</HI> when I gave my con&s;ent to make &s;uch an appearance, as I made, among a thou&s;and &s;trangers, at a Ma&s;querade!</P>
<P>But now, I think, &s;omething offers of blame in the character of this almo&s;t faultle&s;s man, as his &s;i&s;ter, and her Jenny, repre&s;ent him to be.</P>
<P>I cannot think, from a hint given by Mi&s;s Grandi|&s;on, that he is quite &s;o frank, and &s;o unre&s;erved, as his &s;i&s;ter is. Nay, it was more than a hint: I will repeat her very words: She had been mentioning her own openne&s;s of heart, and yet confe&s;&s;ing that &s;he would have kept one or two things from him, that affected him not. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But as for my brother, &s;aid &s;he, he winds one about, and about, yet &s;eems not to have more curio&s;ity than one would wi&s;h him to have. Led on by his &s;miling benignity, and fond of his attention to my prattle, I have caught my&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a tale of which I intended not to tell him one &s;yllable.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O Sir Charles, where am I got? have I &s;aid; and &s;uddenly &s;topt.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Proceed, my Charlotte! No re&s;erves to your neare&s;t friend.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Yet he has <HI>his,</HI> and I have winded and winded about him, as he had done about me; but all to no purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Neverthele&s;s, he has found means, in&s;en&s;ibly, to &s;et me on again with my own &s;tory, till I had told him all I knew of the matter; and all the time I was intending only that my frankne&s;s &s;hould be an exam|ple to him; when he, in&s;tead of an&s;wering my wi&s;hes, double-locked the door of his heart, and left
<PB N="259" REF="266">
not &s;o much as the key-hole uncovered, by which I might have peeped into it; and this in one or two points, that I thought it imported me to know. And then have I been ready to &s;cold.'</Q></P>
<P>Now this re&s;erve to &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter, and in points that &s;he thinks it imports her to know, is what I do not like in Sir Charles. A <HI>friend</HI> as well as &s;i&s;ter! ought there to be a &s;ecret on on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ide, when there is none on the other? Very likely, he would be as re&s;erved to a wife: And is not marriage the highe&s;t &s;tate of friend|&s;hip that mortals can know? And can friend&s;hip and re&s;erve be compatible? Surely, No.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter, who cannot think he has one fault, ex|cu&s;es him, and &s;ays, that her brother has no other view in drawing her on to reveal her own heart, but the better to know how to &s;erve and oblige her.</P>
<P>But then, might not the &s;ame thing be &s;aid in be|half of the curio&s;ity of &s;o generous a &s;i&s;ter? Or, is Sir Charles &s;o con&s;cious of his own &s;uperiority, as to think he can give advice to her, but wants not hers to him? Or, thinks he meanly of our Sex, and highly of his own? Yet there are but two years difference in their age: And from &s;ixteen to twenty-four, I be|lieve women are generally more than two years afore|hand with the men in ripene&s;s of under&s;tanding; tho', after that time, the men may ripen into a &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation is not my own; for I heard a very wi&s;e man once &s;ay, That the intellects of women u&s;ually ripen &s;ooner than tho&s;e of men; but that tho&s;e of men, when ripened, like trees of &s;low growth, generally hold longer, are capable of higher perfec|tion, and &s;erve to nobler purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Sir Charles has &s;een more of the world, it may be &s;aid, than his &s;i&s;ter has: He has travelled. But is not human nature the &s;ame in every country, allowing only for different cu&s;toms?&mdash;Do not Love, hatred, an|ger, malice, <HI>all</HI> the pa&s;&s;ions in &s;hort, good or bad, &s;hew them&s;elves by like effects in the faces, hearts,
<PB N="260" REF="267">
and actions of the people of every country? And let men make ever &s;uch &s;trong preten&s;ions to knowledge, from their far-fetch'd and dear-bought experience, can|not a penetrating &s;pirit learn as much from the pa&s;&s;ions of a Sir Hargrave Pollexfen in England, as it could from a man of the &s;ame or the like ill qualities, in Spain, in France, or in Italy? And why is the Gre|cian Homer, to this day, &s;o much admired, as he is in all the&s;e nations, and in every other nation where he has been read, and will be, to the world's end, but be|cau&s;e he writes to nature? And is not the language of nature one language throughout the world, tho' there are different modes of &s;peech to expre&s;s it by?</P>
<P>But I &s;hall go out of my depth. All I mean (and, from the frankne&s;s of my own heart, you will expect from me &s;uch a declaration) is, that I do not love that a man &s;o <HI>nearly</HI> perfect, be his motives what they will, &s;hould have re&s;erves to &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter. Don't you think, Lucy, that this &s;eems to be a kind of <HI>fault</HI> in Sir Charles Grandi&s;on? Don't you think, that it would mingle &s;ome <HI>fear</HI> in a &s;i&s;ter's Love of him? And &s;hould one's Love of &s;o amiable a brother be da&s;hed or allayed with <HI>fear?</HI> He is &s;aid to be a good man: And a good man I dare &s;ay he <HI>is:</HI> What &s;ecrets can a good man have, that &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter, living with him in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and di&s;daining not, but, on the contrary, prid|ing her&s;elf in, the title of her brother's <HI>hou&s;ekeeper,</HI> &s;hould not be made acquainted with? Will a man &s;o generous look upon her as he would upon a <HI>mere</HI> hou&s;ekeeper?&mdash;Does not confidence engage confi|dence?&mdash;And are they not by <HI>nature,</HI> as well as incli|nation, friends?</P>
<P>But I fancy I am acting the world, in its malevo|lence, as well as impertinence: That world, which thinks it&s;elf affronted by great and &s;uperior merit; and takes delight to bring down exalted worth to its own level. But, at lea&s;t, you will collect from what I have written, an in&s;tance of my <HI>impartiality;</HI> and
<PB N="361" REF="268">
&s;ee, that, tho' bound to Sir Charles by a tie of gra|titude which never can be di&s;&s;olved, I cannot excu&s;e him, if he be guilty of a diffidence and re&s;erve to his generous &s;i&s;ter, which &s;he is above &s;hewing to him.</P>
<P>If I am allowed to be &s;o happy, as to cultivate this de&s;irable acquaintance [And I hope it is not their way to leave tho&s;e whom they have relieved and rai&s;ed, in order to &s;hine upon, and ble&s;s only <HI>new</HI> objects of com|pa&s;&s;ion] then will I clo&s;ely watch every &s;tep of this excellent man; in hope, however, to find him as per|fect as report declares him, that I may fearle&s;ly make him my theme, as I &s;hall delight to make his &s;i&s;ter my example. And if I were to find any <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> faults in him, never fear, my dear, but my gratitude will enlarge my charity in his favour. But I &s;hall, at the &s;ame time, arm my heart with tho&s;e remembred fail|ings, le&s;t my gratitude &s;hould endanger it, and make me a hopele&s;s fool.</P>
<P>Now, my uncle, do not be <HI>very</HI> hard on your niece. I am &s;ure, very &s;ure, that I am not in danger <HI>as yet:</HI> And indeed I will tell you, by my Lucy, whenever, I find out that I am. Spare, therefore, my dear uncle Selby, all your <HI>conjectural con&s;tructions.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed you &s;hould in pity &s;pare me, my dear Sir, at pre&s;ent; for my &s;pirits are &s;till weak: I have not yet forgiven my&s;elf for the ma&s;querade affair; e&s;pecially &s;ince Mr. Reeves has hinted to me, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on (as he judges from what he dropt about that fooli&s;h amu&s;ement) approves not of ma&s;|querades. And yet &s;elf-partiality has &s;ugge&s;ted &s;everal &s;trong pleas in my favour; indeed by way of extenua|tion only. How my judge, CONSCIENCE, will de|termine upon tho&s;e pleas, when coun&s;el has been heard on both &s;ides, I cannot &s;ay: Yet I think, that an acquittal from this brother and &s;i&s;ter, would go a great way to make my con&s;cience ea&s;y.</P>
<P>I have not &s;aid one half of what I intended to &s;ay of this extraordinary man. But having imagined, from

the equal Love I have to his admirable &s;i&s;ter, that I had found &s;omething to blame him for, my impartiality has carried me out of my path; and I know not how to recover it, without going a great way back.

<P>But yet I will not &s;uffer any other &s;ubject to inter|fere with that which fills my heart with the prai&s;es, the due prai&s;es of this worthy brother and &s;i&s;ter; to which I intended to con&s;ecrate this rambling and very imperfect Letter: And which here I will conclude, with a&s;&s;urances (however needle&s;s I hope they are) of duty, Love, and gratitude, where &s;o much due from</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Feb. 24, &amp; 25.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOW have I near a week to go back, my Lucy, with my current narrative, having been thrown behind-hand by the long Letters I have been obliged to write, to give you an account of my di&s;tre&s;s, of my deliverance, of the characters of this noble brother and &s;i&s;ter, and a multitude of coincidences and re|flexions, which all my dear friends expect, as they fall in, from the pen of their Harriet. And this Letter &s;hall therefore be a kind of diary of that week; only that I will not repeat what my cou&s;in Revees has told me he has written.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> I was conducted home in &s;afety, by my kind protector, and his amiable &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Reeves, Lady Betty, and Mi&s;s Clements, are in Love with them both.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in has told you, how much they di&s;ap|pointed us, in declining to &s;tay dinner. What &s;hall we
<PB N="263" REF="270">
do, if they are not as fond of our company as we are of theirs? We are not u&s;ed to be &s;lighted, you know: And to be &s;lighted by tho&s;e we love, there can be no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">earing of that. But I hope this will not be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>At tea, the name of Sir Rowland Meredith carried me in&s;tantly down.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves had old the good Knight, on his calling on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and on this day, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re we returned from Colnebrooke&punc; that I had been over-fatigued at the Ma&s;querade on Thur&s;day night <HI>[And &s;o I was];</HI> and was gone a little way out of town. <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ried</HI> he &s;hould have &s;aid: I was carried with a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tne&s;s!</P>
<P>Sir Rowland took notice, that I mu&s;t have had a &s;mart illne&s;s for the time, by my alter'd countenance. You are, and mu&s;t be, ever lovely, Mi&s;s Byron: But I think you look not quite &s;o &s;erene, you don't look &s;o <HI>compo&s;ed</HI> as you u&s;ed to do. But I was afraid you were denied to my longing &s;ight. I was afraid you would let your papa go down to Caermarthen, without giving him an opportunity to ble&s;s his cro&s;s girl. It is in vain, I fear, to urge you&mdash;He &s;topt, and look'd full in my face&mdash;Pray, Sir Rowland, &s;aid I, how does my <HI>brother</HI> Fowler?</P>
<P>Why, ay, that's the duce of it! Your <HI>brother</HI> Fowler. But as the hone&s;t man &s;ays, &s;o &s;ay I; I will not teaze you. But never, never, will you have&mdash;But no more of that&mdash;I come to take my leave of you. I &s;hould have &s;et out this very morning, could I have &s;een you on Saturday or Ye&s;terday. But I &s;hall go to-morrow morning early. You are glad of that, madam, I am &s;ure.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir Rowland, I &s;hall always re&s;pect and value you. And I hope I &s;hall have your good wi&s;hes, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, yes, madam, you need not doubt it. And I will humble all the proud women in Wales, by telling them of Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="271">
You tell me, my Lucy, that you were all moved at one of the conver&s;ations I gave you between the Knight, Mr. Fowler, and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Were I to be as particular in my account of what pa&s;&s;ed on Sir Rowland's taking leave of me, as I was on that other occa&s;ion, and were you to judge by the effect his hone&s;t tenderne&s;s had on me, as I craved his ble&s;&s;ing, and as he ble&s;&s;ed me (the big tears, unheeded by him&s;elf, &s;traying down his reverend cheeks) I think you would have been in like manner affected.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler is to go down after him&mdash;If&mdash;if&mdash;if, &s;aid the Knight, looking fervently in my face&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad, I &s;aid, to &s;ee, and to wi&s;h my <HI>brother</HI> a good journey.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> morning early I had a kind enquiry after my re&s;t, from Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, in her brother's name, as well as in her own. And about eleven o'clock came the dear Lady her&s;elf. She would run up &s;tairs to me, following Sally&mdash;In her dre&s;&s;ing-room, &s;ay you?&mdash;She &s;hall not come down.</P>
<P>She entered with the maid&mdash;Writing, my dear! &s;aid &s;he. I one day hope, my Harriet, you will &s;hew me all you write.&mdash;There, there (&s;itting down by me) no bu&s;tle. And how <HI>does</HI> my fair friend?&mdash;<HI>Well</HI>&mdash;I &s;ee <HI>very</HI> well&mdash;<HI>To</HI> a Lover&mdash;or <HI>of</HI> a Lover&mdash;that's the &s;ame thing.&mdash;</P>
<P>Thus, &s;weetly familiar, ran &s;he on.</P>
<P>Mrs. Reeves entered: Excu&s;e me, madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: This is but one of my flying vi&s;its&punc; as I call them: My next &s;hall be to <HI>you.</HI> But perhaps I may not make it in form neither: We are relations, you know. How does Mr. Reeves? He is a good man. At home?&mdash;</P>
<P>He is, madam, and will be rejoiced&mdash;</P>
<P>I know he will&mdash;Why, madam, this our Byron, our Harriet, I &s;hould &s;ay, looks charmingly!&mdash;You had be&s;t lock her up. There are many more Sir Har|grave's in the world, than there are Mi&s;s Byron's.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="272">
She told me, that Sir Charles had &s;et out that morn|ing early for Canterbury. He will be ab&s;ent two or three days, &s;aid &s;he. He charged me with his com|pliments. He did nothing but talk of his new-found &s;i&s;ter, from the time he parted with you. I &s;hall pro|mote <HI>your</HI> intere&s;t with him, in order to &s;trengthen <HI>my own.</HI> I want to find him out.</P>
<P>Some love-engagements, I &s;uppo&s;e, madam? &s;aid Mrs. Reeves&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible, but the Ladies&mdash;</P>
<P>The Ladies! Ay, that's the thing&punc; The duce is in them! They will not &s;tay to be a&s;ked. The&s;e men, the be&s;t of them, love nothing but what is attended with difficulty. But all his Love-matters he keeps to him&s;elf; yet knows all mine&mdash;Except one little <HI>entan|glement</HI>&mdash;Mr. Reeves hears not what we &s;ay (looking about her): But you, my dear, &s;hall reveal to me your <HI>&s;neaking</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, if you have one, and I will di&s;cover mine&mdash;But not to <HI>you,</HI> Mrs. Reeves. No married women &s;hall I tru&s;t with what lies in the innermo&s;t fold of my heart. Your hu&s;bands are always the wi&s;er <HI>for what you</HI> know; tho' <HI>they</HI> can keep their own coun&s;el; and then, Harriet, Satan-like, the ungene|rous wretches, becoming both tempters and accu&s;ers, laugh at us, and make it wonderful for a woman to keep a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>The Ladies will not &s;tay to be a&s;ked, <HI>Lucy!&mdash;An odd hint!</HI>&mdash;The&s;e men, the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of them, love nothing but what comes to them with difficulty.&mdash;He keeps all his Love matters to him&s;elf. <HI>ALL, my Lucy!&mdash;But in|deed &s;he had &s;aid before, that if Sir Charles married,</HI> half a dozen hearts would be broken!</P>
<P>This is nothing to <HI>me</HI> indeed. But, once more, I wonder why a man of a turn &s;o laudable, &s;hould have <HI>any</HI> &s;ecrets? The more a good man permits any one to know of his heart, the more good he might do, by way of example.&mdash;And has he, can he have, <HI>&s;o many</HI> Love-&s;ecrets, and yet will he not let them tran|&s;pire to &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter?&mdash;Whom (and &s;o &s;he once hinted)
<PB N="266" REF="273">
it imported to know &s;omething of them. But, <HI>he</HI> knows be&s;t. I am very impertinent to be more con|cerned for his &s;i&s;ter, than &s;he is for her&s;elf. But I do love her. And one can no more bear to have tho&s;e &s;lighted whom we love, than one's &s;elf.</P>
<P>It is very difficult, Lucy, to know one's &s;elf. I am afraid I have a little &s;pice of cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s in my tem|per, which I knew nothing of till now: But, no, it is not cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s neither: I cannot be &s;o mean, as to be cen&s;orious: And yet I can now, methinks (for the fir&s;t time) a little account for tho&s;e dark &s;pirits who may be too much obliged; and who, de&s;pairing to be able ever to return the obligation, are ready to quarrel with the obliger.</P>
<P>Spiteful men &s;ay, that we women know not our|&s;elves; know not our own hearts. I believe there is &s;omething of truth in the a&s;per&s;ion: But as men and women are <HI>brothers and &s;i&s;ters,</HI> as I may &s;ay, are not the men <HI>equally</HI> cen&s;urable? And &s;hould not we wo|men <HI>&s;ay</HI> &s;o, were we to be as &s;piteful as they? Mu&s;t it needs be, that a <HI>daughter</HI> of the &s;ame father and mo|ther mu&s;t be more &s;illy, more un&s;teady, more ab&s;urd, more impertinent, than her brother?&mdash;I hope not.</P>
<P>Mrs. Reeves not knowing, as &s;he &s;aid afterwards, but Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on might have &s;omething to &s;ay to me, withdrew.</P>
<P>I believe I told you la&s;t Sunday, &s;aid Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on, of a cou&s;in that we have: A good-natured young fellow: He &s;upped with us la&s;t night. Sir Charles was &s;o full of your prai&s;es, yet not letting him into your hi&s;tory, that he is half-wild to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>God forbid, thought I, when &s;he had gone only thus far, that this <HI>cou&s;in</HI> &s;hould be propo&s;ed&mdash;What an ea&s;y thing is it, my Lucy, to alarm a woman on the &s;ide of her vanity!</P>
<P>He breakfa&s;ted with me this morning, continued &s;he, after Sir Charles had &s;et out; and knowing that I intended to make you a flying vi&s;it, he be&s;ought me
<PB N="267" REF="274">
to take him with me: But I would not, my dear, bring an inundation of new admirers upon you: He has a great acquaintance; and is very hold, tho' not indecent: He is thought to be a modern wit, you mu&s;t know; and, to &s;peak after an admirable writer, a <HI>minute</HI> philo&s;opher; and thinks he has &s;omething to &s;ay for him&s;elf when his cou&s;in is not pre&s;ent. Be|fore Sir Charles arrived, and when we were in ex|pectation of his coming, being appris'd that Sir Charles had a &s;erious turn, he threatened to play upon him, and, as he phra&s;ed it, to <HI>bamboozle</HI> him; for the&s;e wits and witlings have a language peculiar to them&s;elves. But on Sir Charles's arrival, in two con|ver&s;ations, he drew in his horns, as we &s;ay; and now reverences tho&s;e good qualities which, however, he has not the grace to imitate. Now I will not an&s;wer, but you may have a vi&s;it from him, to &s;ee the lovelie&s;t woman in England. If he comes, &s;ee him, or not, as you plea&s;e; and think not your&s;elf under any civil obligation to my brother, or me, to go out of your own way: But I hope he will not be &s;o impertinent. I don't wi&s;h you to &s;ee him out of my brother's com|pany; becau&s;e you will &s;ee him then to his own ad|vantage. And yet he has &s;uch a notion that we wo|men love to be admired, and to have hand&s;ome things &s;aid to us, that he imagines, the vi&s;it of a man, made for <HI>that</HI> purpo&s;e, will give him as free a welcome to the fine&s;t woman in the world, as painters give to tho&s;e who come to &s;ee their pictures, and for the like rea&s;on. But no more of Mr. Grandi&s;on. Yet I thought proper to prepare you, if he &s;hould take &s;o confident a liberty.</P>
<P>I thanked her.</P>
<P>Well but, my dear, you &s;eem to have a long parcel of writing before you: One, two, three, four&mdash;Eight leaves&mdash;Upon my word!&mdash;But Mr. Reeves told me you are a writer; and that you gave an account of all that befel you, to <HI>our</HI> grandmother Shirley, to <HI>our</HI>

uncle and aunt Selby, to <HI>our</HI> cou&s;ins Lucy and Nancy&mdash;You &s;ee I remember every name: And will you one day let me &s;ee what you write?</P>

<P><HI>Madam!</HI> interrupted &s;he. So formal! <HI>Charlotte</HI> &s;ay. With all my heart, my ever-amiable, my ever|kind, Charlotte.</P>
<P>So, &s;o&mdash;Well may the men &s;ay, we love flattery, when rather than want it, we will flatter one another.</P>
<P>I was going to di&s;claim flattery: Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, hu&s;h, my dear, I doubt not your &s;incerity. You are a grate|ful and good girl: But dare you, will you, &s;hew me all and every-thing about that Greville, that Orme, that Fowler, that Fenwick?&mdash;You &s;ee, I forget none of the names that your cou&s;in Reeves told me of on Saturday la&s;t, and which I made you talk of la&s;t Sun|day.</P>
<P>All and every-thing, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: But will you tell me of <HI>your</HI> gentleman?</P>
<P>Will I! No doubt of it: How can young women be together one quarter of an hour, and not lead one another into talk of their Lovers! Lord, my dear, tho&s;e &s;ecrets, Sir Charles once &s;aid, are the cement of young womens friend&s;hips.</P>
<P>And could Sir Charles&mdash;</P>
<P>Could Sir Charles!&mdash;Yes, yes, yes. Do you think a man can be a judge of human nature, and leave <HI>women</HI> out of the que&s;tion? Why, my dear, he finds us out in a minute. Take care of your&s;elf, Har|riet&mdash;If&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall be afraid of him&mdash;</P>
<P>What if you have a good con&s;cience, my dear!&mdash;She then looked very archly. She made me blu&s;h. She look'd <HI>more</HI> archly. I blu&s;h'd, I believe, a deeper dye.</P>
<P>Did I not tell you, Lucy, that &s;he could do what &s;he plea&s;ed with her eyes?&mdash;But what did &s;he <HI>mean</HI> by this?</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276">
In my con&s;cience, my Harriet, little or much, I believe we women are all rogues in our hearts.</P>
<P>And does Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;ay that from her own con&s;cience?</P>
<P>I believe I do: But I mu&s;t fly: I have ten more vi&s;its to pay before I go home to dre&s;s. You will tell me all about your fellows, you &s;ay?</P>
<P>And you will tell me about your <HI>entanglement,</HI> as you called it.</P>
<P>Why that's a difficulty upon me: But you mu&s;t encourage me by your freedom, and we will take up our wretches and lay them down again, one by one, as we run them over, and bid them lie &s;till and be quiet till we recal them to our memory.</P>
<P>But I have not one Lover, my Charlotte, to tell <HI>you</HI> of: I always gave them their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;</P>
<P>And I have but two, that at pre&s;ent I care to own; and they <HI>won't</HI> be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: But then I have half a dozen, I believe, that have &s;aid extravagant things to me; and we mu&s;t look upon them as Lovers elect, you know, who, only want to be coquetted with.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, I hope, cannot think of coquet|ting?</P>
<P>Not much: only a little now-and-then, to pay the men in their own coin.</P>
<P>Charming vivacity! &s;aid I. I &s;hall be undone, if you don't love me.</P>
<P>No fear, no fear of that!&mdash;I am a whim&s;ical crea|ture; but the &s;un is not more con&s;tant in his cour&s;e than I am &s;teady in my friend&s;hips. And the&s;e com|munications on both &s;ides will rivet us to each other, if you treat me not with re&s;erve.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e to go in a hurry. Abate, my bear Char|lotte, of half your other vi&s;its, and favour me with your company a little longer.</P>
<P>Give me &s;ome chocolate then; and let me &s;ee your cou&s;in Reeves's: I like them. Of the ten vi&s;its, &s;ix of the ladies will be gone to &s;ales, or to plague trade&s;men,
<PB N="270" REF="277">
and buy nothing: Any-where rather than at home: The devil's at home, is a phra&s;e: And our modern ladies live as if they thought &s;o. Two of the other four called upon me, and hardly alighted: I &s;hall do &s;o by them. The other two I &s;hall have paid my com|pliments to in one quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>I rang for chocolate; and to beg my cou&s;ins com|pany.</P>
<P>They wanted but the word; In they came. My apartment (which the was plea&s;ed to admire) then be|came the &s;ubject of a few moments conver&s;ation: And then a much better took place: Sir Charles, I mean.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, if her brother had any relations at Can|terbury?</P>
<P>I prote&s;t I don't know, &s;aid &s;he: But <HI>this</HI> I know, That I have none there. Did I not hint to you, that Sir Charles has his &s;ecrets?&mdash;But he &s;ometimes loves to play with my curio&s;ity: He knows, I have a rea|&s;onable quantity of that.</P>
<P>Were I his &s;i&s;ter&mdash;</P>
<P>Then you mu&s;t do as he would have you, Harriet. I know him to be &s;teady in his purpo&s;es: But he is be&s;ides &s;o good, that I give up any-thing to oblige him&mdash;</P>
<P>Your <HI>entanglement,</HI> Charlotte? a&s;ked I, &s;miling. Mr. Reeves knows nothing from that word.</P>
<P>Why, yes, my <HI>entanglement;</HI> and yet I hate to think of it: So no more of that. It is the only &s;ecret I have kept from him; and that is, becau&s;e he has no &s;u&s;picion of the matter: if he had, tho' my life were to be the forfeit, I believe he would have it.</P>
<P>She told us, that &s;he expected us &s;oon to dine with her in St. James's Square: But that &s;he mu&s;t fix Sir Charles. I hope, &s;aid &s;he, you will often drop in upon me; as I will upon you. From this time, we will have nothing but conver&s;ation-vi&s;its between us; and we will leave the modern world to them&s;elves; and be Queen Elizabeth's women. I am &s;orry to tell you&mdash;Let me whi&s;per it.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="278">
And &s;he did; but loud enough for every one to hear: Altho' I follow the fa&s;hion, and make one fool the more for it, I de&s;pi&s;e above one half of the wo|men I know.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, affectedly whi&s;pered I again, &s;hould <HI>not</HI> do &s;o; becau&s;e her example is of weight enough to mend them.</P>
<P>I'll be hang'd if Mi&s;s Byron thinks &s;o, re-whi&s;per'd &s;he. The age is too far gone. Nothing but a national calamity can do it. But let me tell you, that, at the &s;ame time, I de&s;pi&s;e <HI>more</HI> than one half of the men. But, &s;peaking out, you and I will try to think our|&s;elves wi&s;er than any-body el&s;e; and we &s;hall have this comfort, we &s;hall not ea&s;ily find any of our &s;ex, who by their &s;uperior wi&s;dom will give us rea&s;on to think our&s;elves mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But adieu, adieu, and adieu, my agreeable friends! Let me &s;ee you, and you, and you, turning to each of the three, as often as is convenient, without cere|mony: And remember we have been acquainted the&s;e hundred years.</P>
<P>Away &s;he hurried, forbidding me to go out of my apartment. Mrs. Reeves could not overtake her. Mr. Reeves had much ado to be in time to make his com|pliments. She was in her chariot before he could offer his hand.</P>
<P>How pretty it was, my Lucy, in Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, to remember the names of all my dear friends! She told me indeed, on Sunday, that &s;he &s;hould.</P>
<P>If travelling into foreign countries gives ea&s;e and politene&s;s, would not one think that Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on has vi&s;ited every European court, as well as her bro|ther? If &s;he has not, was it <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for Sir Charles to go abroad to acquire that freedom and ea&s;e which his &s;i&s;ter has &s;o happily attained without &s;tirring out of the kingdom?</P>
<P>The&s;e men had not be&s;t de&s;pi&s;e us, Lucy. There is not, I hope, &s;o much difference in the genius's of
<PB N="272" REF="279">
the two &s;exes as the proud ones among theirs are apt to imagine; e&s;pecially when you draw compari&s;ons from equal degrees in both.</P>
<P>O Mr. Walden, take care of your&s;elf, if ever again you and I meet at Lady Betty's!&mdash;But this abominable Sir Hargrave! Not one word more of meeting at Lady Betty's! There &s;aw I fir&s;t the wretch that &s;till, on recollection, &s;trikes terror into my heart.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> a vi&s;it from Mi&s;s Clements and Lady Betty took me off my writing about two hours; yet I over-writ my&s;elf, and was obliged to lie down for about two more. At night we had Sir John Alle&s;tree, and his nephew, and Mi&s;s Alle&s;tree, and Mi&s;s Cle|ments, and Lady Betty, at &s;upper, and cards. But, my &s;tomach paining me, about eleven I was permit|ted to retire to bed.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> I fini&s;hed my Letters, relating my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and deliverance. It was a dreadful &s;ubject. I rejoiced when I had concluded it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day Mr. Reeves received Sir Charles's Letter, inclo&s;ing that of the wretched Wil&s;on. I have of|ten heard my grandfather ob&s;erve, that men of truly great and brave &s;pirits are mo&s;t tender and merciful; and that, on the contrary, men of ba&s;e and low minds are cruel, tyrannical, in&s;olent, where-ever they have power. What this &s;hort Letter, &s;o full of lenity, of mercy, of generous and humane care for the future good of a criminal, and extended to unborn families, as well as to all his acquaintance and friends in being, enables one to judge of the truly heroic Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; and what I have experienced of the low, groveling, unmanly in&s;ults of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen (I a poor defencele&s;s &s;illy girl, trick'd into his power); are flagrant proofs of the ju&s;tice of the ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, with all my heart, that the be&s;t woman in the world were queen of a great nation; and that it were in my power, for the &s;ake of enlarging Sir Charles's ability to do good, to make him her con&s;ort: Then
<PB N="273" REF="280">
am I morally &s;ure, that I &s;hould be the humble means of making a whole people happy!</P>
<P>But as we had all been informed from other hands, of Sir Hargrave's threatnings of Sir Charles's life, Wil|&s;on's po&s;t&s;cript has fa&s;tened a weight on my heart, that will not be removed till the danger is overblown.</P>
<P>This day I had Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's compliments, with tender enquiries, brought me; and a de&s;ire, that as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed my fir&s;t vi&s;it would be one of thankful duty, meaning to Church (for &s;o I had told her it &s;hould) my next might be to her.</P>
<P><HI>Ye&s;terday</HI> I received the welcome packet, from &s;o many kind friends: And I pro&s;ecuted with the more vigour, for it, my writing-ta&s;k. How ea&s;ily do we glide into &s;ubjects that plea&s;e us!&mdash;How &s;wiftly flies the pen!&mdash;The characters of Sir Charles and of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on were the &s;ubjects; and I was amazed to find how much I had written in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;ent me in the evening of this day her compliments, joined with tho&s;e of her brother, who was but ju&s;t returned from Canterbury.</P>
<P>I wonder what Sir Charles could do at Canterbury &s;o many days, and to have nobody there whom his &s;i&s;ter knows.</P>
<P>She would have made me a vi&s;it, &s;he &s;ent me word; but that as &s;he expected her brother in the morning, &s;he had intended to have brought him with her. She added, that this morning <HI>(Saturday)</HI> they &s;hould both &s;et out for Colnebrooke, in hopes of the Earl and Coun|te&s;s of L. arriving there as this night from Scotland.</P>
<P>Do you think, Lucy, it would not have been ge|nerous in Sir Charles to have made <HI>one</HI> vi&s;it, before he &s;et out for &s;o many days, to <HI>that</HI> Canterbury, to the creature on whom he had laid &s;uch an obligation? I can only mean as to the <HI>civility</HI> of the thing, you mu&s;t think; &s;ince he was &s;o good to join in, nay, to propo&s;e, the farther intimacy, as a brother, and friend, and &s;o-forth&mdash;I wi&s;h that Sir Charles be as &s;incere in
<PB N="274" REF="281">
his profe&s;&s;ions as his &s;i&s;ter. He may in his travels (po&s;|&s;ibly he may) have mi&s;taken &s;ome gay weeds for fine flowers, and pick'd them up, and brought them with him to England: And yet, if he has done &s;o, he will, even then, be &s;uperior to thou&s;ands, who travel, and bring home nothing, but the weeds of foreign cli|mates.</P>
<P>He once &s;aid, as Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on told me, that the Counte&s;s of L. is &s;till a more excellent woman than my Charlotte. Ah! Sir Charles! You can tell fibs, I believe. I will not forgive in you, tho&s;e &s;lighter de|viations, which we are too apt to pa&s;s by in other, even tolerable, men.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you may be in earne&s;t, my good Sir, in pro|po&s;ing to cultivate an intimate friend&s;hip with me, as that of a brother to a &s;i&s;ter [Shake your head, my Lucy, if you will, I mean no more] that I may be intitled to tell you your faults, as I &s;ee them. In your &s;i&s;ter <HI>Harriet,</HI> you &s;hall find, tho' a re&s;pectful, yet an open|eyed monitor. Our Charlotte thinks you cannot be wrong in any-thing.</P>
<P>All I fear is, that Sir Charles's tenderne&s;s was de&s;ign|ed to be excited, only while my &s;pirits were weak. Yet he be&s;poke a brotherly relation to me, before Mr. Reeves, when he brought me home, and &s;uppo&s;ed me &s;tolen from his family in my infancy. That was going farther than was nece&s;&s;ary, if he thought to drop the fraternal character &s;oon.</P>
<P>But might not my own behaviour alarm him? The kind, the con&s;iderate man, is perhaps compa&s;&s;ionate in his intention. Not di&s;tingui&s;hing aright my ba&s;h|ful gratitude, and down-ca&s;t eye, he might be afraid, le&s;t I &s;hould add one to the half-&s;core, that his &s;i&s;ter &s;ays, will die if he marry.</P>
<P>If this be &s;o, what, my dear, will your Harriet de|&s;erve, if <HI>his</HI> caution does not teach <HI>her</HI> &s;ome?</P>
<P>After all, I believe, the&s;e men in general, think our hearts are made of &s;trange combu&s;tible materials. A
<PB N="275" REF="282">
&s;park &s;truck, a match thrown in&mdash;But the be&s;t of men, this admirable man, will, I hope, find him&s;elf mi&s;taken, if he think &s;o of your Harriet.</P>
<P>What ails me, that I am grown &s;uch a boa&s;ter! Surely, this horrid attempt of Sir Hargrave has not affected my brain. Methinks I am not, &s;ome how or other, as I u&s;ed to be in my head, or heart, I know not which.</P>
<P>Do you, Lucy, bring me back again, by your reminding Love, if you think there is any alteration in your Harriet, for the wor&s;e: And the rather, as it may prevent my uncle&mdash;</P>
<P>But what makes me &s;o much more afraid of my uncle, than I u&s;ed to be?&mdash;Yet men&punc; in their raillery, [Don't, however, read this paragraph to him] are &s;o&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;&s;o <HI>un</HI>-tender&mdash;But let me fall into the hands of my indulgent grandmamma, and aunt Selby, and into your gentle hands, and all will be as it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>But what was my &s;ubject, before this la&s;t &s;eized, and ran away with, my pen? I did not u&s;e to wander thus, when I had a beaten path before me. O this vile, vile Sir Hargrave! if I have a fault in my head, that did not u&s;e to be there, it is entirely owing to him. I am &s;ure my heart is not wrong.</P>
<P>But I can write nothing now but of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on and her brother. What entirely new &s;cenes are opened to me by my di&s;tre&s;s?&mdash;May I have cau&s;e, as Sir Charles wi&s;hed, to reap good from the evil!</P>
<P>I will endeavour to bring Mi&s;s Clements into an acquaintance with the&s;e worthie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">; that is to &s;ay, if I have my&s;elf the intere&s;t to pre&s;erve my footing in their favour.</P>
<P>Lady Betty re&s;olves to recommend <HI>her&s;elf.</HI> She <HI>will</HI> be acquainted with them, &s;he &s;ays, whether they will or not. And yet I could not bear for Lady Betty that &s;he &s;hould be &s;lighted by tho&s;e whom &s;he dotes upon&punc; That, &s;urely, is one of the heavie&s;t of evils&punc;

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU might ea&s;ily believe, that the affair betwixt Sir Hargrave Pollexfen and Sir Charles Grandi&s;on could not, after &s;o violent an in&s;ult as the former re|ceived from the latter, end without con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="284">
By all that's &s;acred, Sir Hargrave knows not that I write.</P>
<P>There is but one way that I can think of to prevent blood&s;hed; and that, madam, &s;eems to be in your own power.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that he meant you no|thing but honour. You know the u&s;e or abu&s;e of the power he had obtained over you. If he behaved with indecency, he tells me not the truth.</P>
<P>To make a young Lady, whatever were her merit, the wife of a man of near 10,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, and who had declared him&s;elf ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged in her af|fections, was not doing di&s;honour to her, &s;o much as to him&s;elf, in the violent mea&s;ures his Love obliged him to take to make her &s;o.</P>
<P>Now, madam, as Sir Charles Grandi&s;on was utterly a &s;tranger to you; as Sir Hargrave intended &s;o ho|nourably by you; and, as you are not engaged in your affections; if you will con&s;ent to be Lady Pol|lexfen; and if Sir Charles Grandi&s;on will a&s;k pardon for his unprovoked knight-errantry; I will not be Sir Hargrave's &s;econd in the affair, if he refu&s;e to accept of &s;uch &s;atisfaction in full for the violence he &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>I &s;olemnly repeat, that Sir Hargrave knows nothing of my writing to you. You may (but I in&s;i&s;t upon it, as in confidence to every-body el&s;e) con&s;ult your cou&s;in Reeves on the &s;ubject. Your honour given, that you will in a month's time be Sir Hargrave's, will make me exert all my power with him (and I have rea&s;on to think that is not &s;mall) to induce him to compro|mi&s;e on tho&s;e terms.</P>
<P>I went to Sir Charles's hou&s;e ye&s;terday afternoon, with a Letter from Sir Hargrave. Sir Charles was ju&s;t &s;tepping into his chariot to his &s;i&s;ter. He opened it; and, with a civility that became his character, told me he was ju&s;t going with his &s;i&s;ter to Colnebrooke, to meet dear friends on their return from Scotland: That he &s;hould return on Monday; that the plea&s;ure he
<PB N="278" REF="285">
&s;hould have with his long-ab&s;ent friends, would not permit him to think of the contents till then: But that the writer &s;hould not fail of &s;uch an an&s;wer as a gentleman ought to give.</P>
<P>Now, madam, I was &s;o much charm'd with Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's &s;ine per&s;on, and politene&s;s, and his character is &s;o extraordinary, that I thought this interval between this night and Monday morning an happy one. And I took it into my head to make the above propo&s;al to you; and I hope you will think it behoves <HI>you,</HI> as much as it does <HI>me,</HI> to prevent the fa|tal mi&s;chief that may otherwi&s;e happen, to men of their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I have not the honour of being per&s;onally known to you, madam; but my character is too generally e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for any one to impute to me any other motives for this my application to you, than tho&s;e above given. A line left for me at Sir Hargrave's, in Cavendi&s;h|&s;quare, will come to the hands of, madam,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>O MY dear! What a Letter!&mdash;Mr. Reeves, Mrs. Reeves, are grieved to the heart. Mr. Reeves &s;ays, that if Sir Hardgrave in&s;i&s;ts upon it, Sir Charles is ob|liged, in honour, to meet him&mdash;Murderous, vile word <HI>honour!</HI> What, at this rate, is honour! The very oppo&s;ite to duty, goodne&s;s, piety, religion; and to every thing that is or ought to be &s;acred among men.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I look Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on in the face? Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on will hate me! To be again the occa&s;ion of endangering the life of &s;uch a brother!</P>
<P>But, what do you think?&mdash;Lady Betty is of opinion&mdash;Mr. Reeves has con&s;ulted Lady Betty Williams, in confidence&mdash;Lady Betty &s;ays, that if the matter <HI>can</HI> be prevented&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me! &s;he &s;ays, I <HI>ought</HI> to prevent it!&mdash;What! by becoming the wife of &s;uch a
<PB N="279" REF="286">
man as Sir Hargrave! &s;o unmanly, &s;o malicious, &s;o low a wretch!&mdash;What does Lady Betty mean?&mdash;Yet were it in my power to &s;ave the life of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, and I refu&s;ed to do it; for &s;elfi&s;h rea&s;ons refu&s;ed, for the &s;ake of my worldly happine&s;s; when there are thou&s;ands of good wives, who are mi&s;erable with bad hu&s;bands&mdash;But will not the &s;acrifice of <HI>my</HI> life be accepted by this &s;anguinary man! That, with all my heart, would I make no &s;cruple to lay down. If the wretch will plunge a dagger in my bo&s;om, and take that for &s;atisfaction, I will not he&s;itate one mo|ment.</P>
<P>But my cou&s;in &s;aid, that he was of opinion, that Sir Charles would hardly be brought to a&s;k pardon. How can I doubt, &s;aid I, that the vile man, if he may be induced by this Bagenhall to compromi&s;e on my being his wife, will di&s;pen&s;e with that punctilio, and wreak on me, were I to be his unhappy property, his whole unmanly vengeance? Is he not &s;piteful, mean, malicious?&mdash;But, abhorred be the thought of my yeild|ing to be the wife of &s;uch a man!&mdash;Yet, what is the alternative? Were I to die, that wretched alternative would &s;till take place: His malice to the be&s;t of men would rather be whetted than blunted, by my irrevo|cable de&s;tiny! O my Lucy! violent as my grief was, dreadful as my apprehen&s;ions were, and unmanly as the treatment I met with from the ba&s;e man, I never was di&s;tre&s;s'd till now!</P>

And is not calamity nece&s;&s;ary to wean our vain hearts from it? And if my motive be a motive of ju&s;tice and gratitude, and to &s;ave a life much more valuable to the world than my own; and which, but for me,

<P>O Lucy!

How near may be the life of this dear brother to a period, when he congratulates the &s;afe arrival of <HI>his</HI> brother and &s;i&s;ter!

<P>Mr. Reeves thinks, that no &s;tep ought to be, or can be, taken in this &s;hocking affair, till Sir Charles returns, or Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on can be con&s;ulted. He has taken mea&s;ures to know every motion of the vile Sir Hargrave.</P>

<P>HERE is a &s;weet &s;prightly billet. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on cannot know, the Counte&s;s cannot know, any-thing of the dreadful affair, that has given to my counte|nance, and I am &s;ure will continue on it, an appear|ance, that, did I not always dre&s;s when I aro&s;e for the morning, would make me regardle&s;s of <HI>that</HI> Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on hints at.</P>
<P>What joy, at another time, would the honour of this vi&s;it have given us! But even now, we have a melancholy plea&s;ure in it: Ju&s;t &s;uch a one, as the &s;or|rowing friends of the de&s;perate-&s;ick, experience, on the coming-in of a long-expected phy&s;ician, altho' they are in a manner hople&s;s of his &s;ucce&s;s. But a coach &s;tops.&mdash;</P>
<P>I ran to the dining-room window. O my dear! It is a coach; but only the two Ladies! Good God!&mdash;Sir Charles at this moment, at this moment, my bod|ing heart tells me&mdash;</P>

<P>My heart is a little lighter: Yet not unapprehen|&s;ive&mdash;Take my narrative in cour&s;e, as I &s;hall endea|vour to give you the particulars of every-thing that pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t more than agreeable three hours.</P>
<P>I had ju&s;t got down into the great parlour, before the Ladies entered. Mr. Reeves waited on them at their coach. He handed in the Counte&s;s. Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on, in a charming humour, entered with them.
<PB N="284" REF="291">
There, Lady L. fir&s;t know our cou&s;in Reeves, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, after &s;aluting Mrs. Reeves, turned to me&mdash;There, Lady L. &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, That's the girl! That's our Harriet!&mdash;Her lady&s;hip &s;aluted me&mdash;But how now! &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on looking earne&s;tly in my face. How now, Harriet!&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Lady L.

<P>Lively and ever-amiable Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, thought I, how will, by-and-by, all this &s;weet &s;un-&s;hine in your countenance be &s;hut in!</P>
<P>Come, come, I <HI>will</HI> know, proceeded &s;he, making me &s;it down, and taking my hand as &s;he &s;at by me, her fan in the other hand; I <HI>will</HI> know the whole of this matter.&mdash;That's my dear, for I try'd to &s;mile&mdash;An April eye&mdash;Would to heaven the month was come which my Harriet's eye anticipates.</P>
<P>I &s;ighed. Well, but why that heavy &s;igh, &s;aid &s;he?&mdash;Our grandmother Shirley&mdash;</P>
<P>I hope, madam, is very well.</P>
<P>Our aunt Selby? Our uncle Selby? Our Lucy?</P>
<P>All well I hope.</P>
<P>What a duce ails the girl then? Take care I don't have cau&s;e to beat you?&mdash;Have any of your fellows hanged them&s;elves?&mdash;And are you concerned they did not &s;ooner find the rope&mdash;But come, we will know all by-and-by.</P>
<P>Charlotte, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, approaching me [I &s;tood up] you oppre&s;s our new &s;i&s;ter: I wi&s;h, my dear, you would borrow a few of our younger &s;i&s;ter's blu&s;hes. Let me take you out of this lively girl's hands; I have much ado to keep her down, tho' I am her elder &s;i&s;ter. Nobody but my brother can manage her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, madam, is all goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="292">
We have been all di&s;turbed, &s;aid Mrs. Reeves [I was glad to be help'd out] in the fear that Sir Har|grave Pollexfen&mdash;</P>
<P>O madam! He dare not; he will not;&mdash;He'll be glad to be quiet, if you'll let him, &s;aid the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>It was plain they knew nothing of the challenge.</P>
<P>You have not heard any-thing particular, a&s;ked Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, of Sir Hargrave?</P>
<P>I hope your <HI>brother,</HI> madam, has not, an&s;wered I.</P>
<P>Not a word, I dare &s;ay.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t believe, ladies, &s;aid I, that I mu&s;t be greatly affected, were any-thing likely to happen to my deliverer; as all mu&s;t have been laid at my door. Such a family harmony to be interrupted&mdash;</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, this is very good of you: This is like a &s;i&s;ter: But I hope my Brother will be here by-and-by.</P>
<P>And Lord L. added the obliging Counte&s;s, wants to &s;ee you, my dear. Come, my love, if Charlotte is naught, we will make a party again&s;t her; and &s;he &s;hall be but my &s;econd-be&s;t &s;i&s;ter. I hope my Lord and Sir Charles will come together, if they can but &s;hake off wicked Everard, as we call a kin&s;man, whom Sir Charles has no mind to introduce to you, without your leave.</P>
<P>But we'll not &s;tay breakfa&s;t for them, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: They were not certain; and <HI>de&s;ired</HI> we would not.&mdash;Come, come, get us &s;ome breakfa&s;t; Lady L. has been up before her hour; and I have told you, Harriet, that I am an early ri&s;er. I don't choo&s;e to eat my gloves.&mdash;But I mu&s;t do &s;omething to divert my hunger: And &s;tepping to the harp&s;ichord, &s;he touch'd the keys in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hew'd &s;he could make them &s;peak what language &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I attended to her charming finger: So did every one. But breakfa&s;t coming in&mdash;No but I won't, &s;aid &s;he, anticipating our reque&s;ts; and continuing the air by her voice, ran to the table: Hang ceremony, &s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="286" REF="293">
&s;itting down fir&s;t; let &s;lower &s;ouls compliment: And taking &s;ome muffing, I'll have breakfa&s;ted before the&s;e <HI>Pray madams,</HI> and <HI>Pray my dears,</HI> are &s;eated.</P>
<P>Mad girl! Lady L. called her. The&s;e, Mrs. Reeves, are always her airs with us: But I thought &s;he would have been re&s;trained by the example of her &s;i&s;ter Harriet. We have utterly &s;poiled the girl by our fond indulgence. But, Charlotte, is a good heart to be <HI>every-where</HI> pleaded for a whim&s;ical head?</P>
<P>Who &s;ees not the elder &s;i&s;ter in that &s;peech, re|ply'd Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on? But I am the mo&s;t generous creature breathing; yet nobody &s;inds it out. For why do I a&s;&s;ume the&s;e &s;illy airs, but to make <HI>you,</HI> Lady L. &s;hine at my expence?</P>
<P>Still, Lucy, the contents of that Bagenhall's letter hung heavy at my heart. But, as I could not be &s;ure but Sir Charles had his rea&s;ons for concealing the mat|ter from his &s;i&s;ters, I knew not how to enter directly into the &s;ubject: But, thought I, cannot I fi&s;h &s;ome|thing out for the quiet of my own heart; and leave to Sir Charles's di&s;cretion, the manner of his reveal|ing the matter to his &s;i&s;ters, or otherwi&s;e?</P>
<P>Did your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid I to Lady L. arrive on Sa|turday [I knew not how to begin] at the ho&s;pitable hou&s;e at Colnebrooke, my a&s;ylum?</P>
<P>I did: And &s;hall have a greater value for that hou&s;e than ever I had before, for its having afforded a &s;helter to &s;o valued a lady.</P>
<P>You have been told, Ladies, I &s;uppo&s;e, of that Wil&s;on's letter to Sir Charles?</P>
<P>We have: And rejoice to find, that &s;o deep a plot was &s;o happily fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>His po&s;t&s;cript gives me concern.</P>
<P>What were the contents of it?</P>
<P>That Sir Hargrave breathed nothing but revenge.</P>
<P>Sir Charles told us nothing of that: But it is not unlikely that a man &s;o greatly di&s;appointed &s;hould rave and threaten. I am told that he is &s;till, either by &s;hame or illne&s;s, confined to his chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="294">
At that moment, a chariot &s;topt at the door: And in&s;tantly, It is Lord L. and Sir Charles with him, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>I dared not to tru&s;t my&s;elf with my joy. I hurried out at one of the doors, as if I had forgot &s;omething, as <HI>they</HI> entered at the other. I ru&s;h'd into the back parlour&mdash;Thank God! Thank God! &s;aid I.&mdash;My gra|titude was too &s;trong for my heart: I thought I &s;hould have fainted.</P>
<P>Do you wonder, Lucy, at my being &s;o much affect|ed, when I had been in &s;uch a dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and had formed &s;uch terrible ideas of the danger of one of the be&s;t of men, all owing to his &s;erving and &s;ave|ing me?</P>
<P>Surprizes from joy, I fancy, and where gratitude is the principal &s;pring, are &s;ooner recovered from, than &s;ur|prizes which rai&s;e the more &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions. Mrs. Reeves came in to me: My dear! Your withdrawing will be noticed. I was ju&s;t coming in, &s;aid I: And &s;o I was. I went in.</P>
<P>Sir Charles bowed low to me: So did my Lord. Permit me, madam, &s;aid Sir Charles, to pre&s;ent Lord L. to you: He is our brother&mdash;Our late-found &s;i&s;ter Harriet, my Lord.</P>
<P>Yes, but, Sir Charles, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, Mi&s;s Byron, and Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, have been torment|ing them&s;elves about a po&s;t&s;cript to that footman's letter. You told not us of that po&s;t&s;cript.</P>
<P>Who minds po&s;t&s;cripts, Charlotte? Except indeed to a Lady's Letter. One word wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h you, good Mi&s;s Byron; taking my hand, and leading me to the win|dow.</P>
<P>How the fool colour'd! I could feel my face glow.</P>
<P>O Lucy! What a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inferiority fills a mind not ungenerous, when it labours under the &s;en&s;e of obligations it cannot return!</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter Charlotte, madam, was impatient to pre&s;ent to you her beloved &s;i&s;ter. Lady L. was as impatient to
<PB N="288" REF="295">
attend you. My Lord L. was equally de&s;irous to claim the honour of your acquaintance. They in&s;i&s;ted upon my introducing my Lord. I thought it was too precipitant a vi&s;it, and might hurt your delicacy, and make Charlotte and me appear, as if we had been o&s;tentatiou&s;ly boa&s;ting of the opportunities that had been thrown into our hands, to do a very common &s;er|vice. I think I &s;ee that you are hurt. Forgive me, madam, I will follow my own judgment another time. Only be a&s;&s;ured of this, that your merits, and not the &s;ervice, have drawn this vi&s;it upon you.</P>
<P>I could not be di&s;plea&s;ed at this polite addre&s;s, as it helped me to an excu&s;e for behaving &s;o like a fool, as he might think, &s;ince he knew not the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>You are very obliging, Sir. My Lord and Lady L. do me great honour. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on cannot do any|thing but what is agreeable to me. In &s;uch company, I am but a common per&s;on: But my gratitude will never let me look upon your &s;ea&s;onable protection as a common &s;ervice. I am only anxious for the con|&s;equences to your&s;elf. I &s;hould have no pretence to the gratitude I &s;peak of, if I did not own, that the reported threatnings, and what Wil&s;on writes by way of po&s;t&s;cript, have given me di&s;turbance, le&s;t your &s;afety &s;hould, on my account, be brought into hazard.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron &s;peaks like her&s;elf: But whatever were to be the con&s;equences, can you think, madam, that a man of any &s;pirit could have acted otherwi&s;e than I did? Would I not have been glad, that any man would have done ju&s;t the &s;ame thing, in favour of my &s;i&s;ter Charlotte? Could I behave with greater mo|deration? I am plea&s;ed with my&s;elf on looking back; and that I am not always: There &s;hall no con&s;equences follow, that I am not forced upon in my own ne|ce&s;&s;ary defence.</P>
<P>We &s;poke loud enough to be heard: And Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, joining us, &s;aid, But pray, brother, tell us,
<PB N="289" REF="296">
if there be grounds to apprehend any-thing from what the footman writes?</P>
<P>You cannot imagine but Sir Hargrave would blu&s;ter and threaten: To lo&s;e &s;uch a prize, &s;o near as he thought him&s;elf to carrying his point, mu&s;t affect a man of his ca&s;t: But are Ladies to be troubled with <HI>words?</HI> Men of true courage do not threaten.</P>
<P>Shall I beg one word with you, Sir Charles? &s;aid my cou&s;in Reeves.</P>
<P>They withdrew to the back parlour; and there Mr. Reeves, who had the Letter of that Bagenhall, &s;hew|ed it to him.</P>
<P>He read it&mdash;A very extraordinary Letter! &s;aid he; and gave it back to him&mdash;But pray, what &s;ays Mi&s;s Byron to it?&mdash;Is <HI>&s;he</HI> willing to take this &s;tep in con|&s;ideration of my &s;afety?</P>
<P>You may believe, Sir Charles, &s;he is greatly di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As a tender-hearted woman, and as one who thinks already much too highly of what was done, &s;he <HI>may</HI> be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: But does &s;he he&s;itate a moment upon the part &s;he ought to take? Does &s;he not de&s;pi&s;e the writer and the writing?&mdash;I thought Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;topt, it &s;eems, and &s;poke and looked warm; the fir&s;t time, &s;aid Mr. Reeves, that I thought Sir Charles, on occa&s;ion, pa&s;&s;ionate.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, Lucy, that he had not &s;topt. I wi&s;h he had &s;aid <HI>what</HI> he thought Mi&s;s Byron. I own to you; that it would go to my heart, if I knew that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on thought me a mean creature.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t think, Sir Charles, that Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, Mr. Reeves, forgive me for interrupting you, what &s;teps have been taken upon this Letter.</P>
<P>None, Sir.</P>
<P>It has <HI>not</HI> been honoured with notice; not with the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> notice.</P>
<P>It has not.</P>
<P>And could it be &s;uppo&s;ed by the&s;e mean men (All

men are mean, Mr. Reeves, who can be <HI>premeditatedly</HI> guilty of a ba&s;ene&s;s) that I would be brought to a&s;k par|don for my part in this affair? No man, Mr. Reeves, would be more ready than my&s;elf to a&s;k pardon, even of my inferior, had I done a wrong thing: But never &s;hould a <HI>prince</HI> make me &s;toop to di&s;avow a right one.</P>
<P>But, Sir Charles, let me a&s;k you; Has Sir Hargrave challenged you? Did this Bagenhall bring you a Let|ter?</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave has: Bagenhall did: But what of that Mr. Reeves? I promi&s;ed an an&s;wer on Monday. I would not &s;o much as think of &s;etting pen to paper on &s;uch an account, to interrupt for a moment the hap|pine&s;s I had hoped to receive in the meeting of a Si&s;ter and her Lord, &s;o dear to me! An an&s;wer I have ac|cordingly &s;ent him this day.</P>
<P>You <HI>have</HI> &s;ent him an an&s;wer, Sir!&mdash;I am in great apprehen&s;ions&mdash;</P>
<P>You have no rea&s;on, Mr. Reeves, I do a&s;&s;ure you. But let not my &s;i&s;ters nor Lord L. know of this mat|ter. Why &s;hould I, who cannot have a moment's un|ea&s;ine&s;s upon it, for <HI>my own</HI> &s;ake, have the needle&s;s fears and apprehen&s;ions of per&s;ons to whom I wi&s;h to give nothing but plea&s;ure, to contend with? An ima|ginary di&s;tre&s;s, to tho&s;e who think it more than ima|ginary, is a real one: And I cannot bear to &s;ee my <HI>freinds</HI> unhappy.</P>
<P>Have you accepted, Sir&mdash;Have you&mdash;</P>
<P>I have been two much engaged, Mr. Reeves, in &s;uch cau&s;es as this: I never drew my &s;word but in my own defence, and when no other means could defend me. I never could bear a de&s;igned in&s;ult. I am na|turally pa&s;&s;ionate. You know not the pains it has co&s;t me, to keep my pa&s;&s;ion under: But I have &s;uffered too much in my after-regret, when I have been hur|ried away by it, not to endeavour to re&s;train its fir&s;t &s;allies.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, you will not meet&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="298">
I will not meet any man, Mr. Reeves, as a duelli&s;t. I am not &s;o much a coward, as to be afraid of being branded for one. I hope my &s;pirit is in general too well known for any one to in&s;ult me on &s;uch an im|putation. Forgive the &s;eeming vanity, Mr. Reeves; but I live not to the world: I live to my&s;elf; to the monitor within me.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves applauded him with his hands and eyes; but could not in words. The <HI>heart</HI> &s;poke the&s;e la&s;t words, &s;aid my good cou&s;in. How did his face &s;eem to &s;hine in my eyes!</P>
<P>There are many bad cu&s;toms, Mr. Reeves, that I grieve for: But for none &s;o much as this of preme|ditated duelling. Where is the magnanimity of the man that cannot get above the vulgar breath? How many fatherle&s;s, brotherle&s;s, &s;onle&s;s families have mourned all their lives the unhappy re&s;ort to this dread|ful practice! A man who defies his fellow-creature into the field, in a private quarrel, mu&s;t fir&s;t de&s;y his God; and what are his <HI>hopes,</HI> but to be a murderer to do an irreparable injury to the innocent family and dependents of the murdered?&mdash;But &s;ince you have been let into the matter &s;o far by the unaccount|able Letter you let me &s;ee, I will &s;hew you Sir Har|grave's to me.&mdash;This is it, pulling it out of his pock|et-book.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>YOU did well, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, to leave your name.

<P>I have a copy of my an&s;wer &s;omewhere&mdash;Here it is. You will wonder, perhaps, Mr. Reeves, on &s;uch a &s;ubject as this, to &s;ind it a long one. Had Sir Har|grave known me better than he does, &s;ix lines might have been &s;ufficient.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Bagenhall gave me yours on Saturday la&s;t, ju&s;t as I was &s;tepping into my chariot to go out of town. Neither the general contents, nor the time mentioned in it, made it nece&s;&s;ary for me to alter my mea&s;ures. My &s;i&s;ter was already in the chariot. I had not done well to make a woman unea&s;y. I have many friends; and I have great <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> in promoting <HI>theirs.</HI> I promi&s;ed an an&s;wer on Monday.</P>
<P>My an&s;wer is this&mdash;I have ever refu&s;ed (and the oc|ca&s;ion has happened too often) to draw my &s;word up|on a &s;et and formal challenge. Yet I have rea&s;on to think, from the &s;kill I pretend to have in the weapons, that in declining to do &s;o, I con&s;ult my con&s;cience ra|ther than my &s;afety.</P>
<P>Have you any friends, Sir Hargrave? Do they love you? Do you love them? Are you de&s;irous of life for their &s;akes? for your own?&mdash;Have you enemies to whom your untimely end would give plea&s;ure?&mdash;Let the&s;e con&s;iderations weigh with you: They do, and always did, with me. I am cool: You cannot be &s;o. The cool per&s;on, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, &s;hould
<PB N="293" REF="300">
put the warm one on thinking: This however as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But one more que&s;tion let me a&s;k you&mdash;If you think I have injured you, is it prudent to give me a chance, were it <HI>but</HI> a chance, to do you a &s;till greater injury?</P>
<P>You were engaged in an unlawful enterprize. If you would not have done by me in the &s;ame &s;ituation&punc; what I did by you, you are not, let me tell you, Sir Hargrave, the man of honour, that a man of honour &s;hould be &s;ollicituous to put upon a foot with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I took not an unmanly advantage of you, Sir Har|grave: You drew upon me: I drew not in return. You had a di&s;advantage in not quitting your chariot; after the lunge you made at me, you may be thank|ful that I made no u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have been &s;orry, had I been able to give the Lady the protection &s;he claimed, with le&s;s hurt to your&s;elf: For I could have no malice in what I did: Altho' I had, and have &s;till, a ju&s;t abhorrence of the voilence you were guilty of to an helple&s;s woman; and who I have found &s;ince merited better treatment from you; and indeed merits the be&s;t from all the world; and who&s;e life was endangered by the violence.</P>
<P>I write a long Letter, becau&s;e I propo&s;e <HI>only</HI> to write. Pardon me for repeating, that the men who have acted as you and I have acted, as well with regard to the <HI>Lady,</HI> as to <HI>each other,</HI> cannot, were their principles &s;uch as would permit them to meet, meet upon a foot.</P>
<P>Let any man in&s;ult me upon my refu&s;al, and put me upon my defence, and he &s;hall find that numbers to my &s;ingle arm &s;hall not intimidate me. Yet, even in <HI>that</HI> ca&s;e, I would much rather choo&s;e to clear my|&s;elf of them as a man of honour &s;hould wi&s;h to do, than either to kill or maim any man. My life is not my own: Much le&s;s is another man's mine. Him who thinks differently from me, I can de&s;pi&s;e as hearti|ly as he can de&s;pi&s;e me. And if &s;uch a one imagines,
<PB N="294" REF="301">
that he has a title to my life, let him take it: But it mu&s;t be in my own way, not in his.</P>
<P>In a word, If any man has aught again&s;t me, and will not be concluded by the Laws of his country, my goings out, and comings in, are always known; and I am any hour of the day to be found, or met with, where-ever I have a natural call. My &s;word is a &s;word of defence, not of offence. A pi&s;tol I only carry on the road, to terrify robbers: And I have found a le&s;s dangerous weapon &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to repel a &s;udden in&s;ult. And now, if Sir Hargrave Pol|lexfen be wi&s;e, he will think him&s;elf obliged for this not unfriendly expo&s;tulation, or whatever he plea&s;es to call it, to</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Reeves be&s;ought Sir Charles to let him &s;hew me the&s;e Letters.</P>
<P>You may, Mr. Reeves, &s;aid he; &s;ince I intend not to meet Sir Charles in the way he pre&s;cribes.</P>
<P>As I a&s;ked not leave, Lucy, to take copies of them, I beg they may not be &s;een out of the venerable circle.</P>
<P>I know I need not &s;ay how much I am plea&s;ed with the contents of the latter: I doubt not but you all will be equally &s;o: Yet, as Sir Charles him&s;elf expects not that Sir Hargrave will re&s;t the matter here; and indeed &s;ays he cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with the vulgar no|tions of honour; do you think I can be ea&s;y, as all this is to be placed to my account?</P>
<P>But it is evident, that Sir Charles <HI>is.</HI> He is go|verned by another &s;et of principles, than tho&s;e of fal&s;e honour; and &s;hews what his &s;i&s;ter &s;ays to be true, that he regards fir&s;t his duty, and then what is called honour. How does the knowlege of the&s;e his excellen|cies rai&s;e him in my mind! Indeed, Lucy, I &s;eem &s;ome|times to feel, as if my gratitude had rai&s;ed a throne or him in my heart; but yet as for a dear friend, as
<PB N="295" REF="302">
a beloved brother only. My reverence for him is too great&mdash;A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, my dear, that this reverence will always keep me right.</P>
<P>Sir Charles and Mr. Reeves returning into com|pany, the conver&s;ation took a general turn. But, op|pre&s;&s;ed with obligations as I am, I could not be lively. My heart, as Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;ays, is, I believe, a proud one. And when I thought of what might &s;till happen (who knows, but from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, in re&s;ent|ment of &s;ome very &s;pirited &s;trokes in Sir Charles's Letter, as well as from the di&s;grace the wretch mu&s;t carry in his face to the grave?) I could not but look upon this fine man, who &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s his own &s;oul in peace, &s;ometimes with concern, and even with tender grief, on &s;uppo&s;ing, that now, lively and happy, as he &s;eemed to be, and the joy of all his friends, he might po&s;&s;ibly, and perhaps in a few hours&mdash;How can I put down my horrid thoughts!</P>
<P>At other times, indeed, I ca&s;t an eye of &s;ome plea|&s;ure on him (when he looked another way) on think|ing him the only man on earth, to whom, in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, I could have wi&s;hed to owe the obligations I am under to him. His mode&s;t merit, thought I, will not make one unea&s;y: He thinks the protection af|forded but a common protection. He is accu&s;tomed to do great and generous things. I might have been obliged to a man who&s;e fortune might have made it convenient for him to hope &s;uch advantages from the ri&s;que he run for me, as prudence would have made objections to comply with, not a little embarra&s;&s;ing to my gratitude.</P>
<P>But here my heart is left free. And O, thought I, now-and-then, as I looked upon him, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is a man with whom I would not <HI>wi&s;h</HI> to be in Love. I, to have &s;o many rivals! He to be &s;o much admired! Women not to &s;tay till they are a&s;ked, as Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on once &s;aid; his heart mu&s;t be proof again&s;t tho&s;e tender &s;en&s;ations, which grow into ardour,
<PB N="296" REF="303">
and glow, in the bo&s;om of a man pur&s;uing a <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>only</HI> Love.</P>
<P>I warrant, my Lucy, if the truth were known, altho' Sir Charles has at Canterbury, or at one place or other, his half-&s;core Ladies, who would break their hearts if he were to marry, yet he knows not any <HI>one</HI> of them whom he loves better than another. And all but right! All but ju&s;tice, if they will not &s;tay till they are a&s;ked!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on invited Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, and me, to dinner, on Wedne&s;day, and for the re&s;t of the day and evening. It was a welcome invitation.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf plea&s;ed with me. Poor and &s;piritle&s;s as was the figure which I made in this whole vi&s;it, her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in my favour from Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on mu&s;t have been very great and generous.</P>
<P>And will you not, before now, have expected, that I &s;hould have brought you acquainted with the per&s;ons of Lord and Lady L. as I am accu&s;tomed to give you de&s;criptions of every one to whom I am intro|duced?</P>
<P>To be &s;ure we have, &s;ay you.</P>
<P>Well, but my mind has not always been in tune to gratify you. And, upon my word, I am &s;o much hum|bled with one thing and another, that I have lo&s;t all that pertne&s;&s;, I think, which u&s;ed to give &s;uch a liveline&s;s to my heart, and alertne&s;s to my pen, as made the writing ta&s;k plea&s;ant to me, becau&s;e I knew that you all conde&s;cended to like the flippant airs of your Harriet.</P>
<P>Lady L. is a year older than Sir Charles: But has that true female &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy in her features, which make her perfectly lovely; and &s;he looks to be two or three years younger than &s;he is. She is tall and &s;lender; and enjoys the ble&s;&s;ing of health and &s;pirits in an high degree. There is &s;omething of more dig|nity and &s;prightline&s;s in the air and features of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, than in tho&s;e of Lady L: But there is in
<PB N="297" REF="304">
tho&s;e of the latter, &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s and complacency, that you are not &s;o much afraid of her as you are of her &s;i&s;ter. The one you are &s;ure to love at fir&s;t &s;ight: The other you will be ready to a&s;k leave to let you love her; and to be ready to promi&s;e that you will, if &s;he will &s;pare you: And yet, whether &s;he will or not, you cannot help it.</P>
<P>Lady L. is &s;uch a wife, I imagine, as a good wo|man &s;hould wi&s;h to be thought. The behaviour of my Lord to her, and of her to my Lord, is free, yet re&s;pectful; affectionate, but not api&s;hly fond. One &s;ees their Love for each other in their eyes. All Love|matches are not happy: This was a match of Love; and does honour to it. Every-body &s;peaks of Lady L. with equal affection and re&s;pect, as a di&s;creet and pru|dent woman. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, by her livelier manner, is not &s;o well under&s;tood in tho&s;e lights as &s;he ought to be; and, &s;atisfied with the worthine&s;s of her own heart, is above giving her&s;elf concern about what the world thinks of it.</P>
<P>Lord L. is not hand&s;ome; but he is very agreeable. He has the look of an hone&s;t good man; and of a man of under&s;tanding. And he is what he looks to be. He is genteel, and has the air of a true Briti&s;h nobleman; one of tho&s;e, I imagine, that would have been re&s;pected by his appearence and manners, in the pure&s;t times, an hundred or two years (or how long?) ago.</P>
<P>I am to have the family-hi&s;tory of this Lord and Lady, on both &s;ides, and of their Loves, their difficul|ties, and of the obligations they talk of being under to their brother, to whom both my Lord and Lady be|have with Love that carries the heart in every word, in every look.</P>
<P>What, my dear, &s;hall we &s;ay to this brother? Does he lay every-body that knows him under obligation? And is there no way to be even with him in any one thing? I long to have &s;ome intimate conver&s;ation with
<PB N="298" REF="305">
Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, by which I &s;hall perhaps find out the art he has of making every-body proud of acknow|ledging an inferiority to him.</P>
<P>I almo&s;t wi&s;h I could, while I &s;tay in town, devote half my time to this amiable family, without break|ing in upon them, &s;o much as to be thought imperti|nent. The other half ought to be with my kind cou&s;in Reeves's. I never &s;hall make them amends for the trouble I have given them.</P>
<P>How I long for Wedne&s;day, to &s;ee all the family of the Grandi&s;on's&mdash;They are all to be there&mdash;On &s;everal accounts I long for that day: Yet this Sir Hargrave&mdash;</P>
<P>I have written, my dear, as u&s;ual, very unre&s;ervedly. I know that I lie more open than ever to my uncle's ob&s;ervations. But if he will not allow for weakne&s;s of heart, of head, and for having been frighted out of my wits, and cruelly u&s;ed; and for further apprehen|&s;ions; and for the &s;en&s;e I have of obligations that never can be returned; why then I mu&s;t lie wholly at his mercy&mdash;But if he &s;hould find <HI>me</HI> to be ever &s;o &s;illy a creature, I hope he will not make his particular con|clu&s;ions general in disfavour of the Sex.</P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t <HI>Harriet,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHO' we have long ago taken a re&s;olution, ne|ver to dictate to your choice; yet we could not excu&s;e our&s;elves, if we did not acquaint you with any propo&s;al that is made to us, on your account, that you might encourage it, or otherwi&s;e, as you thought fit.</P>
<P>The dowager Lady D. wrote me a Letter &s;ome time ago (as you will &s;ee by the date): But in&s;i&s;ted, that I
<PB N="299" REF="306">
&s;hould keep the contents a &s;ecret in my own bo&s;om, till &s;he gave me leave to reveal it. She has now given me that leave, and reque&s;ted that I will propo&s;e the matter to you. I have &s;ince &s;hewn what has pa&s;&s;ed between her Lady&s;hip and me, to your grandmamma, Mr. Selby, and Lucy. They are all &s;ilent upon it; for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, that I give you not my opinion; that is to &s;ay, till you a&s;k it.</P>
<P>But do we not &s;ee, my deare&s;t child, that &s;omething has happened, within a very few days pa&s;t, that mu&s;t di&s;tance the hope of every one of your admirers, as they come to be acquainted with the circum&s;tances and &s;ituation you are now in? My dear love, you will never be able to re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;es of that gratitude which always opened and expanded your worthy heart.</P>
<P>Your uncle's tenderne&s;s for you, on &s;uch a pro&s;pect, has made him &s;uppre&s;s his inclination to railly you. He profe&s;&s;es to pity you, my dear. While, &s;ays he, the &s;weet girl was vaunting her&s;elf, and refu&s;ing this man, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing that; and imagining her&s;elf out of the reach of the deity, to which &s;ooner or later, all women bow, I &s;pared her not: But now, that I &s;ee &s;he is likely to be over head and ears in the pa&s;&s;ion, and has &s;o much to be &s;aid for her excu&s;e if &s;he is caught: and as our &s;ide mu&s;t perhaps be the hoping &s;ide, the gentleman's the triumphant; I pitty her too much for what <HI>may</HI> be the ea&s;e, to teaze her with my animadver&s;ions; e&s;pecially after what &s;he has &s;uffered from the vile Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P>By &s;everal hints in your Letters, it is impo&s;&s;ible, my dear, that we <HI>can</HI> be beforehand with your inclinations. Young women in a beginning Love are always willing to conceal them&s;elves from them&s;elves; they are de&s;i|rous to &s;mother the fire, before they will call out for help, till it blazes, and frequently becomes too power|ful to be extingui&s;hed by <HI>any</HI> help. They will call the pa&s;&s;ion by another name; as, <HI>gratitude,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e: But, my Harriet, gratitude &s;o properly &s;ounded as yours
<PB N="300" REF="307">
is, can be but another name for <HI>Love.</HI> The object &s;o worthy, your own heart &s;o worthy, con&s;ent of minds mu&s;t bring it to Love on one &s;ide; perhaps on both, if the half &s;core of Ladies you have heard of, are all of them but <HI>mere moderns.</HI> But that, my dear, is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed; &s;ince worthy hearts find out, and a&s;&s;imilate with, each other. Indeed, tho&s;e Ladies may be &s;uch as are captivated with outward figure. An hand&s;ome man need not to have the great qualities of a Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, to engage the hearts of the generality of our Sex. But a good man, and an hand|&s;ome man, if he has the vivacity that di&s;tingui&s;hes Sir Charles, may marry whom he plea&s;es. If we women love an hand&s;ome man, for the &s;ake of our eye, we mu&s;t be poor creatures indeed, if we love not good men, for the &s;ake of our hearts.</P>
<P>What makes us apprehen&s;ive for you, my Harriet is this: That we every one of us, are in Love our&s;elves with this fine young gentleman. Your uncle has fallen in with Mr. Daw&s;on, an attorney of Notting|ham, who acts for Sir Charles in &s;ome of his affairs; and gives him &s;uch a character, re&s;pecting his goodne&s;s to his tenants and dependents <HI>only,</HI> as will render cre|dible all that even the fonde&s;t Love, and warme&s;t gra|titude, can &s;ay in his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>We can hardly &s;ometimes tell how to regret (tho' your accounts of your &s;ufferings and danger cut us to the heart as we read them) the ba&s;e attempt of Sir Har|grave: Were all to end as we wi&s;h, we &s;hould not regret it: But that, my Harriet, is our fear. What will become of me, &s;aid your grandmamma, if, at la&s;t, the darling of my heart &s;hould be entangled in an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>If this is likely to be the ca&s;e, while the fire I &s;poke of is but &s;mothering, and while but here and there a &s;park e&s;capes your &s;trugging efforts to keep it down, re&s;olve, my dear, to throw cold water on it, and quench it quite. And how is this to be done, but
<PB N="301" REF="308">
by changing your per&s;onal friend&s;hip with the amiable family, into a corre&s;pondence by pen and ink, and returning to our longing arms, before the flame gets a head?</P>
<P>When you are with us, you may either give hope to the worthy Orme, or encourage the propo&s;al I in|clo&s;e, as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>As you are not capable of the mean pride of &s;eeing a number of men in your train, and have always been unea&s;y at the per&s;everance of Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Greville&mdash;As you have &s;uffered &s;o much from the natural goodne&s;s of your heart, on the urgency of that hone&s;t man Sir Rowland Meredith in his nephew's favour; and &s;till more from the ba&s;ene&s;s of that wicked Sir Hargrave&mdash;As your good character, and lovely per&s;on, engage you more and more admirers&mdash;And, la&s;tly, As it would be the highe&s;t comfort that your grandmamma and your uncle, and I, and all your friends and well-wi&s;hers, could know, to &s;ee you hap|pily married&mdash;We cannot but wi&s;h for this plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction: The &s;ooner you give it to us, the better.</P>
<P>But could there be any hope&mdash;You know what I mean&mdash;A royal diadem, my dear, would be a de&s;pi|cable thing in the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Adieu, my be&s;t Love. You are called upon, in my opinion, to a greater trial than ever yet you knew, of that prudence for which you have hitherto been &s;o much applauded by every one, and particularly by</P>

<PB N="302" REF="309">
occa&s;ion; and, at the &s;ame time, to beg of you to keep &s;ecret, even from Mr. Selby, and the party to be named as &s;till <HI>more</HI> immediately concerned in the &s;ubject, till I give my con&s;ent; as no one creature of my family, not even the Earl of D. my &s;on, does, or &s;hall from me, till you approve of it.</P>
<P>My Lord has ju&s;t entered into his twenty-fifth year. There are not many better young men among the no|bility. His minority gave an opportunity to me, and his other Tru&s;tees, to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when he came of age, of a very noble and clear e&s;tate; which he has not impaired. His per&s;on is not to be found fault with. He has learning, and is allowed to have good &s;en&s;e, which every <HI>learned</HI> man has not. His conduct, his di&s;cretion, in his travels, procured him re&s;pect and reputation abroad. You may make en|quiry privately of all the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>We are, you mu&s;t believe, very &s;ollicitous to have him happily married. He is far from being an un|dutiful &s;on. Indeed he was <HI>always</HI> dutiful. A dutiful &s;on gives very promi&s;ing hopes of making a good hu&s;band. He a&s;&s;ures me that his affections are di&s;|engaged, and that he will pay the mo&s;t particular re|gard to my recommendation.</P>
<P>I have ca&s;t about for a &s;uitable wife for him. I look farther than to the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of a woman; tho' my Lord will by no means have Beauty left out in the qualifica|tions of a wife. I look to the family to whom a Lady owes her education and training-up. Quality, how|ever, I &s;tand not upon. A man of quality, you know, confers quality on his wife. An antient and good gentleman's family is all I am &s;ollicitous about in this re&s;pect. In this light, yours, madam, on all &s;ides, and for many de&s;cents, is unexceptionable. I have a de|&s;ire, if all things &s;hall be found to be mutually agree|able, to be related to it: And your character, as the young Lady has been brought up under your eye, is a great inducement with me.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="310">
Your niece Byron's beauty, and merits, as well as &s;weetne&s;s of temper, are talked of by every-body. Not a Day pa&s;&s;es, but we hear of her to her great ad|vantage. Now, madam, will you be plea&s;ed to an&s;wer me one qu&s;tion, with that explicitne&s;s which the importance of the ca&s;e, and my own intended expli|citne&s;s to you, may require from woman to woman? E&s;pecially, as I a&s;k it of you in confidence.</P>
<P>Are then Mi&s;s Byron's affections ab&s;olutely di&s;en|gaged? We are very nice, and mu&s;t not doubt in this matter.</P>
<P>This is the only que&s;tion I will a&s;k at pre&s;ent. If this can be an&s;wered as I wi&s;h, others, in a treaty of this important nature, will come into con&s;ideration on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The favour of a line, as &s;oon as it will &s;uit your con|venience, will oblige, madam,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLII. Mrs. <HI>SELBY,</HI> To the Counte&s;s Dowager of <HI>D.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Jan. 27.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM greatly obliged to your Lady&s;hip for your good opinion of me, and for the honour you do me, and all our family, in the propo&s;ed alliance.</P>
<P>I will an&s;wer your Lady&s;hip's que&s;tion with the re|qui&s;ite explicitne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Greville, Mr. Orme, and Mr. Fenwick, all of this county, have re&s;pectively made application to us for our intere&s;t, and to Mi&s;s Byron for her favour: But hitherto without effect; tho' the terms each pro|po&s;es might entitle him to con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron profe&s;&s;es to honour the married &s;tate, and one day propo&s;es to make &s;ome man happy in it, if it be not his own fault: But declares, that &s;he has
<PB N="304" REF="311">
not yet &s;een the man to whom with her hand &s;he can give her heart.</P>
<P>In truth, madam, we are all neutrals on this oc|ca&s;ion. We have the highe&s;t opinion of her di&s;cre|tion. She has read, &s;he has conver&s;ed; and yet there is not in the county a better hou&s;ewife, or one who would make a more prudent manager in a family. We are all fond of her, even to doting. Were &s;he <HI>not</HI> our child, we &s;hould love her for her good qua|lities, and &s;weetne&s;s of manners, and a frankne&s;s that has few examples among young women.</P>
<P>Permit me, madam, to add one thing; about which Mi&s;s Byron, in her turn, will be very nice. Your Lady&s;hip is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that my Lord's af|fections are di&s;engaged. Were his Lord&s;hip a prince, and hoped to &s;ucceed with her, they mu&s;t not be &s;o, after he had &s;een and conver&s;ed with her. Yet the future happine&s;s, and not pride, would be the con&s;i|deration with her; for &s;he has that diffidence in her own merits, from which the worthy of both Sexes cannot be totally free. This diffidence would increa&s;e too much for her happine&s;s, were &s;he to be thought of with indifference by any man on earth, who hoped to be more than indifferent to <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>As to other que&s;tions, which, as this is an&s;wered, your Lady&s;hip thinks may come to be a&s;ked, I choo&s;e <HI>un</HI>-a&s;ked (having no re&s;erves) to acquaint your Lady|&s;hip that Mi&s;s Byron has not, in her own power, quite 15,000<HI>l.</HI> She has, 'tis true, rever&s;ionary expectations: But we none of us wi&s;h that they &s;hould for many years take place; &s;ince that mu&s;t be by the death of Mrs. Shirley, her grandmother, who is equally revered and beloved by all that know her; and who&s;e life is bound up in the happine&s;s of her grand-daughter.</P>
<P>I will &s;trictly obey your Lady&s;hip in the &s;ecrecy en|joined; and am, madam,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Feb. 23.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD &s;ooner have an&s;wered yours, had I not waited for the return of my &s;on, who had taken a little journey into Wales, to look into the condition of a &s;mall e&s;tate he has there; which he finds capable of great improvement; and about which he has given proper orders.</P>
<P>I took the fir&s;t opportunity to que&s;tion him in rela|tion to his inclinations to marriage, and whether he had a regard to any particular woman: And having received an an&s;wer to my wi&s;hes, I mentioned Mi&s;s Byron to him, as a young Lady that I &s;hould think, from the general good character &s;he bore, would make him an excellent wife.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he had heard her much talked of, and al|ways to her advantage. I then &s;hewed him, as in confidence, my Letter, and your An&s;wer. There can be, &s;aid I (on purpo&s;e to try him) but one objection on your part; and that is fortune: 15000<HI>l.</HI> to a noble|man, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of 12000<HI>l.</HI> a year, and has been offered four times the portion, may be thought very inadequate. The le&s;s to be &s;tood upon, replied he, where the fortune on my &s;ide is &s;o con&s;iderable. The very an&s;wer, my dear Mrs. Selby, that I wi&s;hed him to make.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, if I &s;hould begin a formal treaty with you, upon what he &s;aid. He an&s;wered, that he had heard from every mouth, &s;o much &s;aid in prai&s;e of Mi&s;s Byron's mind, as well as per&s;on, that he de&s;ired I would; and that I would directly endeavour to ob|tain leave for him to vi&s;it the young Lady.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e it accordingly. I under&s;tand, that &s;he is at pre&s;ent in London. I leave it to your choice, ma|dam,
<PB N="306" REF="313">
and Mrs. Shirley's, and Mr. Selby's (to whom now, as al&s;o to Mi&s;s Byron, you will be &s;o good as to communicate the affair) whether you will &s;end for her down to receive my Lord's vi&s;it and mine; or whe|ther we &s;hall wait on her in town.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e very high &s;atisfaction to my&s;elf, if the young people approve of each other, in an alliance &s;o much to my wi&s;hes in every re&s;pect. I &s;hall love the Counte&s;s of D. as well as any of you can do Mi&s;s Byron. And as &s;he has not at pre&s;ent a mother, I &s;hall with plea&s;ure &s;upply that tender relation to her, for the &s;ake of &s;o many engaging qualities, as com|mon fame, as well as good Mrs. Selby, &s;ays &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of.</P>
<P>You will di&s;patch an an&s;wer as to the interview. I am impatient for it. I depend much upon the frank|ne&s;s of the young Lady, which you make a part of her agreeable character. And am, madam,</P>

<P>INDEED, my dear and ever-indulgent aunt Selby, you have given me pain; and yet I am very un|grateful, I believe, to &s;ay &s;o: But if I feel the pain (tho' perhaps I ought not) &s;hould I not own it?</P>
<P>What <HI>circum&s;tances,</HI> what <HI>&s;ituation,</HI> am I in, ma|dam, that I cannot be mi&s;tre&s;s of my&s;elf? That &s;hall turn my uncle's half-feared, tho' always agreeable, raillery into <HI>pity</HI> for me?</P>
<P>"Over head and ears in the pa&s;&s;ion"&mdash;"I to be on the hoping &s;ide; the gentleman on the trium|phant"&mdash;"It is impo&s;&s;ible for you my friends to be aforehand with my inclinations"&mdash;"A beginning Love to be mentioned, in which one is willing to

<P>And yet &s;ome very tender &s;trokes are in it, that no <HI>man,</HI> that hardly any-body but you among <HI>women,</HI> could write.</P>
<P>But what do you <HI>do,</HI> madam, when you tell your Harriet of your own prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of a man, who, as you thought, had before in my eye too many advantages? Indeed you &s;hould have taken care not to let me know, that his great qualities had impre&s;&s;ed you all &s;o deeply: And my grandmamma to be &s;o <HI>very</HI> apprehen&s;ive too for the <HI>entangled girl.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;aid &s;he? <HI>Entangled in an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion!</HI> O let me die before this &s;hall be de&s;erved to be &s;aid of your Harriet!</P>
<P>Then again ri&s;es to your pen, <HI>&s;mothering</HI> and <HI>e&s;caped &s;parks;</HI> and I am de&s;ired to hurry my&s;elf to get <HI>cold water</HI> to quench the <HI>flame</HI>&mdash;Dear, dear madam, what images are here? And applied&mdash;To whom?&mdash;And by whom?&mdash;Have I written any thing &s;o <HI>very</HI> blazing!&mdash;Surely I have not. But you &s;hould not &s;ay you will all forgive me, if this be my &s;ad &s;ituation. You &s;hould not &s;ay, How much you are <HI>your&s;elves, all of you,</HI> in love with this excellent man; and talk of Mr. Daw|&s;on, and of what he &s;ays of him: But you &s;hould have told me, that if I &s;uffer my gratitude to grow into Love, you will never forgive me; then &s;hould I have had a call of duty to check or controul a pa&s;&s;ion, that you were afraid could not be gratified.</P>
<P>Well, and there is no way left me, it &s;eems, but to fly for it! To hurry away to Northampton&s;hire, and either to begin a new treaty with Lord D. or to give hope to an old Lover. Poor Harriet Byron! And is it indeed &s;o bad with thee? And does thy aunt Selby think it is!</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="315">
But is there no hope, that the man will take <HI>pity</HI> of thee? When he &s;ees thee &s;o &s;adly <HI>entangled,</HI> will he not vouch&s;afe to lend an extricating hand?</P>
<P>Oh, no!&mdash;Too much obliged, as thou already art, how can&s;t thou expect to be further obliged? Obliged in the highe&s;t degree?</P>
<P>But let me try if I cannot play round this bright, this beamy taper, without &s;ingeing my wings! I fancy it is not yet quite &s;o bad with me! At lea&s;t, let me &s;tand this one vi&s;it of to-morrow: And then if I find rea&s;on to think I cannot &s;tand it, I may take the kind advice, and fly for it; rather than add another hopele&s;s girl to the half-&s;core that perhaps have been long &s;ighing for this be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>But even then, my aunt, that is to &s;ay, were I to fly and take &s;helter under your protecting wings, I &s;hall not, I hope, think it <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, to light up one flame, in order to extingui&s;h another. I &s;hall always value Mr. Orme as a friend; but indeed I am le&s;s than ever inclined to think of him in a nearer light.</P>
<P>As to Lady D's propo&s;al, it admits not with me of half a thought. You know, my deare&s;t aunt, that I am not yet <HI>rejected</HI> by one with whom you are all in love&mdash;But this <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> I will own (and yet I hope nothing but my gratitude is engaged, and that indeed is a very powerful tie) that &s;ince I have &s;een and known Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, I have not only (as before) an <HI>indifference,</HI> but a <HI>di&s;like,</HI> to all other men. And I think, if I know my own heart, I had rather con|ver&s;e but an hour in a week with him, and with Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, than be the wife of any man I have ever &s;een or known.</P>
<P>If this &s;hould end at la&s;t in Love, and if I &s;hould be <HI>entangled in an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> the object of it would be Sir Charles Grandi&s;on: He could not in&s;ult me; and, mean as the word <HI>pity</HI> in &s;ome ca&s;es founds, I had rather have his pity, than the love of any other man.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="316">
You will, upon the &s;trength of what I have &s;aid, be &s;o good, dear madam, as to let the Counte&s;s of D. know, that I think my&s;elf highly obliged to her, for her favourable opinion of me: That &s;he has by it in|tere&s;ted all my good wi&s;hes in her &s;on's happine&s;s; and that I was always of opinion, that equality of fortune and degree, tho' not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to matrimonial felicity, was however a circum&s;tance not to be &s;lighted: But you, madam, can put my mean|ing in better, in fitter words, when you are a&s;&s;ured, that it is my meaning, to give an ab&s;olute, tho' grate|ful, negative to this propo&s;al. And I do a&s;&s;ure you, that &s;uch <HI>is</HI> my meaning; and that I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, were I capable of keeping one man in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, even had I hope of <HI>your</HI> hope, while I was balancing in favour of another.</P>
<P>I believe, madam, I have been a little petulant, and very &s;aucy, in what I have written: But my heart is not at ea&s;e: And I am vexed with the&s;e men, one after another, when Sir Hargrave has given me a &s;ur|feit of them; and only that the bad has brought me into the knowledge of the be&s;t, or I could re&s;olve never more to hear a man talk to me, no not for one mo|ment, upon a &s;ubject, that is become &s;o ju&s;tly painful to one who never took plea&s;ure in their any adulation.</P>
<P>I know you will, with your u&s;ual goodne&s;s, and &s;o will my grandmamma, and &s;o will my uncle Selby, pardon all the imperfections of, deare&s;t madam,</P>

<P>Mr. Bagenhall came to Sir Charles ye&s;terday even|ing with a me&s;&s;age from Sir Hargrave, demanding a meeting with him, the next morning, at a particular hour, at Ken&s;ington Gravel-pits. Sir Charles took Mr. Bagenhall with him into his Study, and a&s;king him to &s;it down, Mr. Bagenhall &s;aid, That he was once concerned in an affair of this nature, which had been very much mi&s;repre&s;ented afterwards; and that he had been advi&s;ed to take a &s;tep which Sir Charles might think extraordinary; which was, that he had brought with him a young gentleman, whom he hoped, for Sir Hargrave's &s;atisfaction, as well as to do ju&s;tice to what &s;hould pa&s;s between them, Sir Charles would permit to take minutes of their conver&s;ation: And that he was in the Hall.</P>
<P>Let not a gentleman be left in the Hall, &s;aid Sir Charles; and, ringing, directed him to be &s;hewn into the Study to them. Yet, Mr. Bagenhall, &s;aid he, I &s;ee no occa&s;ion for this. Our conver&s;ation on the &s;ub|ject you come to talk of, <HI>can</HI> be but &s;hort.</P>
<P>Were it to hold but two minutes, Sir Charles.</P>
<P>What you plea&s;e, Mr. Bagenhall.</P>
<P>The young gentleman entered; and pen and ink were &s;et before him. He wrote in &s;hort-hand: And read it to the gentlemen; and Sir Charles, as it was to be tran&s;cribed for Sir Hargrave, de&s;iring a copy of it, it was &s;ent him the &s;ame night.</P>

<P>And you have no other an&s;wer to return?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only this. Let Sir Hargrave engage him&s;elf in a like unworthy enterprize; and let the Lady, as this did, claim my protection; and I will endeavour
<PB N="313" REF="320">
to give it to her, altho' Sir Hargrave were &s;urrounded by as many men armed, as he has in his &s;ervice; that is to &s;ay, if a legal redre&s;s were not at hand: If it were, I hold it not to be a point of bravery to in&s;ult magi&s;tra|cy, and to take upon my&s;elf to be my own judge; and, as it might happen, another man's executioner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is nobly &s;aid, Sir Charles: But &s;till Sir Hargrave had not injured <HI>you,</HI> he &s;ays. And as I had heard you were a man of an excellent character, and as I know that Sir Hargrave is a man of courage, I took it into my head, for the prevention of mi&s;chief, to make a propo&s;al in writing to the Lady, whom Sir Hargrave loves as his own &s;oul; and if &s;he had come into it&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>A &s;trange propo&s;al, Mr. Bagenhall. Could you expect any-thing from it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, Sir Charles? She is di&s;engaged, it &s;eems. I pre&s;ume, Sir, you do not intend to make court to her your&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are in&s;en&s;ibly got into a parley, upon a &s;ubject that will not bear it, Mr. Bagenhall. Tell Sir Hargrave&mdash;or, write it down from my lips, Sir, (&s;peaking to the writer) That I wi&s;h him to take time to enquire after my character, and after my motives in refu&s;ing to meet him, on the terms he expects me to &s;ee him. Tell him, That I have, before now, &s;hewn an in&s;olent man, that <HI>I may be</HI> provoked: But that, when I have been &s;o, I have had the happine&s;s to cha&s;ti&s;e &s;uch a one without murdering him, and without giv|ing any advantage over my own life, to his &s;ingle arm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is great talking, Sir Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, Mr. Bagenhall. And I &s;hould be &s;orry to have been put upon it, were I not in hope, that it may lead Sir Hargrave to &s;uch enquiries as may be for <HI>his</HI> &s;ervice, as much as for <HI>mine.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h, that two &s;uch &s;pirits were better ac|quainted with each other, or that Sir Hargrave had not
<PB N="314" REF="321">
&s;uffered &s;o much as he has done, both in per&s;on and mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does all this tend to, Mr. Bagenhall? I look upon you as a gentleman; and the more, for having &s;aid, You were &s;ollicitous to prevent further mi&s;chief, or I &s;hould not have &s;aid &s;o much to &s;o little purpo&s;e. And once more, I mu&s;t refer to my Letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I admire you for your &s;pirit, Sir. But it is amazing to me, that a man of your &s;pirit can refu&s;e to a gentleman the &s;atisfaction which is de|manded of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is owing to my having &s;ome &s;pirit, that I can, fearle&s;s of con&s;equences, refu&s;e what you call &s;atisfaction to Sir Hargrave, and yet be fearle&s;s of in|&s;ult upon my refu&s;al. I con&s;ider my&s;elf, as a mortal man: I can die but once: Once I mu&s;t die: And if the cau&s;e be &s;uch as will ju&s;tify me to my own heart, I, <HI>for my own &s;ake,</HI> care not, whether my life be de|manded of me to-morrow, or forty years hence: But, Sir (&s;peaking to the writer) Let not this that I have now &s;aid, be tran&s;cribed from your notes: It may to Sir Hargrave found o&s;tentatiou&s;ly. I want not, that any|thing &s;hould be read or &s;hewn to him, that would ap|pear like giving con&s;equence to my&s;elf, except for Sir Hargrave's own &s;ake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg, that it may not be &s;pared. If you are capable of acting as you &s;peak; by what I have heard <HI>of</HI> you in the affair on Houn&s;low-Heath; and by what I have heard <HI>from</HI> you in this conver&s;ation; and <HI>&s;ee</HI> of you; I think you a wonder of a man; and &s;hould be glad it were in my power to reconcile you to each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could not hold friend&s;hip, Mr. Bagenhall, with a man that has been capable of acting as Sir Har|grave has acted, by an innocent and helple&s;s young Lady. But I will name the terms on which I can take by the hand, where-ever I meet him, a man to whom I can have no malice: The&s;e are they, That he lay at
<PB N="315" REF="322">
the door of mad and violent pa&s;&s;ion the illegal at|tempt he made on the be&s;t of women: That he ex|pre&s;s his &s;orrow for it; and, on his knees, if he plea&s;es, (it is no di&s;grace for the <HI>brave&s;t</HI> man to kneel to an injured lady) beg her pardon; and confe&s;s her clemen|cy to be greater than he de&s;erves, if &s;he give it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good God! Shall that be tran&s;cribed, Sir Charles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir. Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means: And if Sir Hargrave is a man that has in his heart the lea&s;t &s;park of mag|nanimity, he will gladly embrace the opportunity of acting accordingly: And put down, Sir, That &s;orrow, that cont rition, is all the atonement that can be made for a perpetrated evil.</P>

<P>DOES not your heart glow, my Lucy, now you have read (as I &s;uppo&s;e you have) this paper? And do not the countenances of every one of my revered friends round you [Pray look!] &s;hine with admiration of this excellent man? And yet you all loved him before: And &s;o you all think I did. Well, I can't help your thoughts!&mdash;But I hope I &s;hall not be un|done by a <HI>good</HI> man!</P>
<P>You will imagine, that my heart was a little agi|tated, when I came to read Mr. Bagenhall's que&s;tion, Whether Sir Charles intended to make court to me him&s;elf? I am &s;orry to tell you, Lucy, that I was a little more affected than I wi&s;hed to be. Indeed, I &s;hall keep a <HI>look-out,</HI> as you call it, upon my&s;elf. To &s;ay truth, I laid down the paper at that place, and was afraid to read the an&s;wer made to it. When I took it up, and read what followed, I might have &s;pared, I &s;aw, my fooli&s;h little tremors. See how frank I continue to be: But if you come not to this para|graph
<PB N="316" REF="323">
before you are aware, you need not read it to my uncle.</P>
<P>Mr. Bagenhall went away &s;o much plea&s;ed with Sir Charles (as he owned) that Mr. Reeves encourages me to hope, &s;ome way may be found to prevent fur|ther mi&s;chief. Yet the condition, which Sir Charles has propo&s;ed for my forgiving the wretch&mdash;Upon my word, my dear, I de&s;ire not to &s;ee Sir Hargrave either upon his knees, or upon his feet: I am &s;ure I could not &s;ee him without very violent emotions. His bar|barity, his malice, his cruelty, have impre&s;&s;ed me &s;trongly: Nor can I be glad to &s;ee the wretch with his disfigured mouth and lip. His lip, it &s;eems, has been &s;ewed up, and he wears a great black-&s;ilk patch, or plai&s;ter, upon the place.</P>
<P>I can't find that Sir Charles has heard from the ex|a&s;perated man, &s;ince Mr. Bagenhall left him ye&s;ter|day.</P>
<P>I hope nothing will happen to over-cloud to-mor|row. I propo&s;e to my&s;elf as happy a day, as, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things, can be given to</P>
