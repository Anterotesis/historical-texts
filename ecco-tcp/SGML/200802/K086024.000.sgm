<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_TO in&s;i&s;t on the Value of Works of this Nature, when they come from Men of real Knowledge and Under&s;tanding, were only to repeat what the wi&s;e&s;t Men have often &s;aid for us. The Reader, we believe, will be convinced that Sir <HI>John</HI> was a Per&s;on very equal to the Task he undertook; and having &s;uch Opportunities of prying, as it were, into the Hearts of the greate&s;t Mini|&s;ters and Princes of his Time, it had been unpardonable in him to have refrained from communicating the many important Matters he &s;o a&s;&s;uredly knew. The Reader, will,
<PB REF="3" MS="y">
we hope, find in him an Impartiality rare|ly met with in Writers, who have been, like him, of a Party; for being a Man of the &s;tricte&s;t Honour, and nice&s;t Con&s;cience, he it &s;eems thought it as unju&s;t not to ap|plaud an Enemy for any good he had done, as weak not to accu&s;e a Friend when, through human Frailty&punc; he hapned to de&s;erve it. This, and what goes before, might be &s;ufficient to be&s;peak the Reader in his Fa|vour, even tho' he had related no Fact but &s;uch as had been an hundred Times repeat|ed before this Appearance of his Book; but as he abounds with Things new, or what is the &s;ame, with Matters known to very few living, and which will much a&s;&s;i&s;t us in forming a right Idea of the Times he lived in, he mu&s;t claim a greater Share of At|tention. But we will now leave Sir <HI>John</HI> to plead his own Cau&s;e, and &s;hall only add, that we flatter our &s;elves with the Appro|bation of the Public for our thus retrieving him from the Rece&s;&s;es of Privacy.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF SIR <HI>JOHN RERESBY.</HI> From the Year 1658 to the Year 1689.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Sir <HI>JOHN</HI> having very minutely acquainted us with his Birth, Education and Travels, which could neither affect the Reader, nor be admitted as Part of what we promi&s;e to print of him, we &s;hall &s;et out from the Year <HI>1658.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THIS Year, &s;ays he, died <MILESTONE N="1658" UNIT="date"> the Protector <HI>Oliver Crom|well,</HI> <MILESTONE N="Sept. 3." UNIT="date"> one of the greate&s;t and brave&s;t Men, had his Cau&s;e been good, the World ever &s;aw. His Actions I leave to the Hi&s;torian; and having been very near his Per&s;on but once, at an Audience of an Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> I can only &s;ay that his Figure did not come up to his Character; he was indeed a likely Per&s;on, but not hand&s;om, nor had he a very bold look with him. He
<PB N="2" REF="5" MS="y">
 was plain in his Apparel, and rather negli|gent than not. Tears he had at will, and was doubtle&s;s, the deepe&s;t Di&s;&s;embler on Earth.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had at|tended <MILESTONE N="Aug. 12." UNIT="date"><MILESTONE N="1659" UNIT="date"> the King in his Exile, had di&s;obliged, and left his Maje&s;ty &s;ome time before, and was now endeavouring to marry the Daugh|ter and Heire&s;s of <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> formerly the Parliament's General, and un|to whom had been granted the greate&s;t Part of the &s;aid Duke's E&s;tate. This Duke was the fine&s;t Gentleman, both for Per&s;on and Wit, I think I ever &s;aw; but he knew not how to be long &s;erious, or mindful of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and had behaved with &s;ome In&s;olence to the King, which was the Cau&s;e of their Separation. It was now that I fir&s;t became acquainted with him, and he from the very fir&s;t Moment expre&s;&s;ed a Kindne&s;s for me.</P>
<P>It was now ea&s;y to perceive that a way was paved to facilitate the King's Return; but &s;till the Rump kept up &s;ome Face of State; and I remember to have been pre|&s;ent at a Dinner, given by the City of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> to <HI>Lambert</HI> and other Officers of the Army, by far more co&s;tly and &s;plendid, than any I ever &s;aw given afterwards to his
<PB N="3" REF="6" MS="y">
Maje&s;ty; &s;o much is Awe more prevalent  than Love. <MILESTONE N="Oct. 20." UNIT="date"></P>
<P>Continuing but in an indifferent State of Health, I, partly for that Rea&s;on, and partly for others, returned to <HI>Paris,</HI> where I had no &s;ooner put my &s;elf into &s;ome Equi|page, but I endeavoured to be known at our Queen Mother's Court, which &s;he then kept at the Palais Royal. Her Maje&s;ty had none of her Children with her, but the Prince&s;s <HI>Henrietta Maria;</HI> and few of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> making their Court there, I was the better received. As I &s;poke the Language of the Country and danced pretty well, the young Prince&s;s, then about fifteen Years of Age, behaved towards me with all the civil Freedom that might be; &s;he made me dance with her, played on the Harp&s;icord to me in her Highne&s;s's Chamber; &s;uffered me to wait on her as &s;he walked in the Garden, and &s;ometimes to to&s;s her in a Swing between two Trees, and, in fine, to be pre&s;ent at all her innocent Diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Queen commanded me to attend as often as I conveniently could; &s;he had a great affection for <HI>England,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Severity of U&s;age &s;he and hers had met with there. With the great Men and La|dies
<PB N="4" REF="7" MS="y">
 of <HI>France,</HI> &s;he di&s;cour&s;ed much in Prai&s;e of the People and Country, of their Courage, their Genero&s;ity, their good Nature, and would excu&s;e all the late Misfortunes, as brought about by &s;ome de&s;perate Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, rather than proceeding from the Genius and Temper of the Nation. To give a lit|tle In&s;tance of her Inclination for the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> I hapned to carry an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentle|man with me one Day to Court, and he, to be very fine, had got him a Garniture of rich Ribbon to his Suit, in which was a Mixture of Red and Yellow; which the Queen ob&s;erving, called to me, and bad me advi&s;e my Friend to mend his Fancy a lit|tle, as to his Ribbons, the two Colours he had joined, being ridiculous in <HI>France,</HI> and might give the <HI>French</HI> Occa&s;ion to laugh at him.</P>
<P>I had three Cou&s;ins then in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Convent at <HI>Paris,</HI> one of them an antient Lady, and &s;ince Abbe&s;s of the Hou&s;e: Hi|ther the Queen was wont often to retire for &s;ome Days; and the Lady would tell me that Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> &s;ince St. <HI>Albans,</HI> had the Queen greatly in awe of him, and indeed it was obvious that he had great Intere&s;t with her Concerns; but that he was marri|ed to her, or had Children by her, as &s;ome
<PB N="5" REF="8" MS="y">
have reported, I did not then believe, tho <MILESTONE N="1660" UNIT="date"> the Thing was certainly &s;o.</P>
<P>The Court of <HI>France</HI> was very &s;plendid this Winter; a grand Mask was danced at the <HI>Louvre,</HI> where the King and Prince&s;s <HI>Henriette</HI> of <HI>England</HI> danced to Admiration: But there was now a greater Re&s;ort to the Palace than the <HI>French</HI> Court; the good Humour and Wit of our Queen Mother, and the Beauty of the Prince&s;s her Daugh|ter being more inviting than any thing that appeared in the <HI>French</HI> Queen, who was a <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen Mother received the News of his Maje&s;ty's happy Re&s;toration, with all imaginable Demon&s;trations of Joy, and a|mong other Things, gave a noble Ball at her Court, to which every Body of the greate&s;t Quality was invited. and to which all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, then at <HI>Paris,</HI> had Admittance. Having been ill &s;ome Time before, I would have been excu&s;ed from Dancing, but the Queen commanded me to take out the Cardinal's Niece, I o|beyed.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed at <HI>Paris</HI> till <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and received more Honours from the Queen and the Prince&s;s her Daughter than I de&s;erved, or could acknowledge, but by the mo&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="9" MS="y">
 con&s;tant Duty and Attendance in my Power.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Aug. 2." UNIT="date"> On the 2d In&s;tant I &s;at out for <HI>England;</HI> but before my Departure, I waited on the Queen for her Commands; &s;he told me &s;he would write by me, and ordered me to at|tend next Morning for her Letter. Hav|ing received it and taken my Leave, I de|&s;ired to know if it required Ha&s;te? Her Maje&s;ty &s;aid, No, for that it contained but little be&s;ides a particular Recommendation of me to her Son the King.</P>
<P>At <HI>London</HI> I met my Mother and mo&s;t of my Relations, who were come up, as from all Parts of <HI>England</HI> they did, to &s;ee the King, and was pre&s;ented by the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> then but Marqui&s;s, to his Maje&s;ty in the privy Chamber at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and de|livering him the Queen's Letter, he asked me &s;everal Que&s;tions, both concerning her and my Voyage.</P>
<P>The Court at <HI>Whitehall</HI> &s;oon became very magnificent, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> having his Court apart, and the Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> his: The Kingdom was now very rich, and Men were generally &s;atisfied with the King's Return, tho' &s;ome Malecontents of &s;everal Sorts there were; and how &s;hould it be o|therwi&s;e? But the King did not much ad|here
<PB N="7" REF="10" MS="y">
to Bu&s;ine&s;s: All was calm and ea&s;y,  he had a Parliament ready to yield to any Thing that was rea&s;onable, as the Acts they made &s;ufficiently declare, and the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> then Chancellor, was at the Helm. The King, who was at an Age and Vigor for it, pur&s;ued his Plea&s;ures; and if Love prevailed with him more than any other Pa&s;&s;ion, he had this for Excu&s;e, be|&s;ides that his Complection was of an amo|rous Sort, the Women &s;eemed to be the Aggre&s;&s;ors; and I have &s;ince heard the King &s;ay That they would &s;ometimes offer them&s;elves to his Embraces: Nor were the two Dukes, his Brothers, more aver&s;e to the Sex than his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="Nov." UNIT="date"> About this Time the King's Aunt (the Queen of <HI>Bohemia)</HI> came over from the <HI>Hague,</HI> as did al&s;o his Si&s;ter, the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange;</HI> but they both dyed &s;oon after their Arrival: as did al&s;o the Duke of <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen Mother often asked me if the King had done any thing for me, and what it was I had fixed my Mind on, that &s;he might &s;peak a Word for me; but in truth I did not at that Time pur&s;ue my own Advan|tage as I might have done; and went to Court rather to conver&s;e and look about me,
<PB N="8" REF="11" MS="y">
 than to &s;ollicit any Favour: I chiefly relied on the Queen's Kindne&s;s to me, and the Influence &s;he had over the King; but all the plea&s;ing Super&s;tructure fell to the Ground; the Queen left <HI>England</HI> &s;oon after the Death of her Children, taking the Prin|ce&s;s <HI>Henrietta</HI> away with her to <HI>Paris,</HI> and I was di&s;appointed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Jan. 6." UNIT="date"> At this Time a &s;mall Rebellion was rai&s;|ed in <HI>London</HI> by one <HI>Venner,</HI> which in its very Ri&s;e was defeated by a Party of the Guards; but running out of Town they rallied again in <HI>Cane-wood</HI> near <HI>Highgate</HI>-Having a mind therefore to &s;ee a little A|ction, I mounted one of my Coach-hor&s;es, and mounted my Man upon the other, and joined Sir <HI>Thomas Sands,</HI> who commanded the Party of the Guards that went in pur|&s;uit of the Incendiaries. Having &s;earch'd the Wood till Midnight, we came to a lit|tle Hou&s;e, where the People told us they had been de&s;iring &s;ome Victuals but a little while before, and that they could not be far off. Accordingly, about an Hour after this, we found &s;ome of them in the thicke&s;t Part of the Wood. They di&s;charged their Pieces at us, but the Moon &s;etting they got from us, and hurried back again to <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="12" MS="y">
where they met with the Fate every <MILESTONE N="1661" UNIT="date"> Body knows. Their Captain and about twenty more were hanged, drawn and quar|tered: About twenty of them were killed in their &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes, and about as many of the King's Men, one of which was &s;hot not far from me in <HI>Cane-Wood.</HI></P>
<P>It was this Summer that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> fir&s;t took any particular Notice of me. I hapned to be in Di&s;cour&s;e with the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;ome other Gentlemen of his Nation, in the Pre&s;ence at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and the Duke joined us, he being a great Lover of the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, and kind to tho&s;e who &s;poke it. The next Night he talked with me a long while, as he was at Supper with the King.</P>
<P>Now it was that the King went to re|ceive <MILESTONE N="1662" UNIT="date"> the Infante of <HI>Portugal</HI> at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> <MILESTONE N="May 19." UNIT="date"> attended by the greate&s;t Court I ever &s;aw in any Progre&s;s. But though, upon this Occa|&s;ion, every thing was gay and &s;plendid, and profu&s;ely joyful, it was ea&s;y to di&s;cern that the King was not exce&s;&s;ively charmed with his new Bride, who was a very little Woman with a pretty tolerable Face; &s;he, neither in Per&s;on nor Manners, had any one Article to &s;tand in Competition with the Charms of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Ca&s;tlemain,</HI> (&s;ince
<PB N="10" REF="13" MS="y">
 Dutche&s;s of <HI>Cleveland)</HI> the fine&s;t Woman of her Age. It is well known that the Lord Chancellor had the Blame of this unfruitful Match, and that the Queen was &s;aid to have had a con&s;tant Fluor upon her, which ren|der'd her incapable of Conception.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1664" UNIT="date"> This Year the War broke out between us and the Dutch; and I re&s;olved to &s;erve as Vo|lunteer in our Fleet, hoping to be on Board the Duke's own Ship. I accordingly equipped my &s;elf with Nece&s;&s;aries for the Sea, and went to procure the King's Leave to go on board, and to receive his Commands to the Duke, intending to be gone the next Day. The King told me he was willing I &s;hould go, but had Letters to write to the Duke, which he would &s;end by me, and ordered me to &s;tay for them day after day (expecting, it &s;eems, fir&s;t to hear from the Duke) till at la&s;t his Maje&s;ty told me he &s;hould not write, and that I needed not now to go, for that the Duke would be &s;peedily on Shore, he not having been able to bring the <HI>Dutch</HI> to Action.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1665" UNIT="date"> A dreadful Plague raged this Summer in <HI>London,</HI> and &s;wept away 97309 Per&s;ons. It was u&s;ual for People to drop down in the Streets as they went about their Bu&s;ine&s;s; and a Story is reported for a certain Truth,
<PB N="11" REF="14" MS="y">
That a Bagpiper being exce&s;&s;ively overcome  with Liquor, fell down in the Street and there lay a&s;leep. In this Condition he was taken up and thrown into a Cart, betimes the next Morning, and carried away with &s;ome dead Bodies. Mean while he awoke from his Sleep, it being now about Day|break, and ri&s;ing up began to play a Tune, which &s;o &s;urpriz'd the Fellows that drove the Cart, who could &s;ee nothing di&s;tinctly, that in a Fright they betook them to their Heels, and would have it that they had taken up the Devil in the Di&s;gui&s;e of adead Man.</P>
<P>But to re&s;ume other Things, I married, and was thereby prevented from being an Eye|witne&s;s of the <HI>Dutch</HI> War; and &s;o I &s;hall only &s;ay that his Highne&s;s obtained a glori|ous Victory over that Republick.</P>
<P>His Royal Highne&s;s the Duke and his Duche&s;s came down to <HI>York,</HI> where it was <MILESTONE N="Aug. 5." UNIT="date"> ob&s;erved that Mr. <HI>Sydney,</HI> the hand&s;ome&s;t Youth of his Time, and of the Duke's Bed|chamber, was greatly in love with the Duche&s;s, and indeed he might well be excu&s;|ed, for the Duche&s;s Daughter to Chancellor <HI>Hide,</HI> was a very hand&s;om Per&s;onage, and a Woman of fine Wit. The Duche&s;s on her Part &s;eemed kind to him, but very innocently: But he had the Misfortune to be bani&s;hed
<PB N="12" REF="15" MS="y">
 the Court afterwards for another Rea&s;on, as was reported.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Oct. 5." UNIT="date"> I went to <HI>Oxford</HI> to put the King in mind of a former Promi&s;e, to make me High She|riff of the County of <HI>York,</HI> the Year next en&s;uing; but hearing that Sir <HI>Francis Cob</HI> (who had been at &s;ome extraordinary Charge in receiving and attending the Court at <HI>York)</HI> obtained a Grant to continue in that Office for another Year, at his High|ne&s;s's Interce&s;&s;ion I waited on the Duke, acquainted him with my Claim, and begged his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. He told me he wi&s;hed he had known my Claim in time, that he &s;hould have been ready to &s;erve me, and that I had neverthele&s;s his Leave to &s;ollicit his Maje&s;ty's Promi&s;e. I thank'd him, but &s;aid I could not appear in any Degree of Oppo&s;ition to his Highne&s;s's Intere&s;t and Plea&s;ure, and would therefore defer my Preten&s;ions to a better Opportunity. This he took very kindly, went with me to the King, and pre&s;ented me to him for the next Year; his Maje&s;ty gave me his Hand to ki&s;s, and his Word once more that I &s;hould be Sheriff as I had de&s;ired.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1666" UNIT="date"> <MILESTONE N="July 25." UNIT="date"> A great and happy Victory was obtained over the <HI>Dutch</HI> by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and a &s;ad and di&s;mal
<PB N="13" REF="16" MS="y">
Fire laid the va&s;t and noble City of <HI>London</HI>  in A&s;hes, but the&s;e being Events that have been of late largely de&s;cribed already, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve of the latter, that the dreadful De&s;truction was not more extraor|dinary than the Speed, Regularity, and Co&s;t wherewith it was retrieved, and a new <HI>London,</HI> far exceeding the old, erected.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Oct. 2." UNIT="date"> I went to <HI>London</HI> to put the King and Duke in mind of their Promi&s;e, that I &s;hould be High Sheriff for the County of <HI>York</HI> for the Year next en&s;uing; and no &s;ooner did I appear before the Duke than he &s;aid to me, <HI>I remembered you tho' you was not here, and Your Bu&s;ine&s;s is done for you.</HI> And, to &s;ay the Truth, there was no Prince at that Time ob&s;erved to be more punctual to his Word. I found what the Duke told me to be perfectly true, the King did graciou&s;ly confirm what he had &s;aid, and named me Sheriff for the County of <HI>York,</HI> tho' I was not of the three pre&s;ent|ed to him by the Judges.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> had been &s;ome <MILESTONE N="1667" UNIT="date"> Time in Di&s;grace at Court; and being &s;u&s;|pected of &s;ome evil Practices again&s;t the King, a Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out to ap|prehend <MILESTONE N="March 8." UNIT="date"> him. I confe&s;s I was at a Lo&s;s to know how to act in this Matter, between the Obligation of my Office as Sheriff, and
<PB N="14" REF="17" MS="y">
 the Re&s;pect I had for the Duke: But the Judges coming down to the A&s;&s;izes, advi&s;ed me by all means to proclaim it, which I did, and It for ever after le&s;&s;ened me in the E|&s;teem of that Lord.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Southampton,</HI> Lord High Trea|&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> being lately dead, the Ad|mini&s;tration of that great Office was tran&s;act|ed by four Commi&s;&s;ioners, the Duke of <HI>Albe|marle,</HI> Lord <HI>A&s;hley Cooper,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> Sir <HI>William Coventry,</HI> Secretary to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Duncomb.</HI> It was now that the Parliament fell upon the great Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> who having &s;urren|dred the Seals, a few Months afterwards as much as po&s;&s;ible to avoid the Heat of his Enemies, retired privately into <HI>France.</HI> His greate&s;t Enemy in the Hou&s;e of Lords was the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Sir <HI>Thomas O&s;borne,</HI> &s;ince Earl of <HI>Danby;</HI> by this Step, and by the help of his Grace the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who was now ab&s;olute Favourite, it was that Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> more e&s;pecially ro&s;e to his height of Dignity.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> now acted as prime Mini&s;ter: The King con&s;ulted him chiefly in all Concerns of Moment; the Fo|reign Mini&s;ters were to apply to him, be|fore
<PB N="15" REF="18" MS="y">
they could be admitted to an Audience.  But he was &s;uch a Foe to Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch a Friend to Plea&s;ure, and &s;o apt to turn the Day into Night, and the Night into Day, that he could neither attend regularly on the King, nor di&s;patch Bu&s;ine&s;s, as it ought to be, with tho&s;e who had any Thing to negociate with him; &s;o his Mini&s;try proved of no long Duration.</P>
<P>This Spring I carried my Family up to <MILESTONE N="1668" UNIT="date"> Town, where the Court and City were all gay and jovial; for Peace was now con|cluded with <HI>France,</HI> with <HI>Spain,</HI> with <HI>Den|mark,</HI> and the <HI>States General.</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors extraordinary were now &s;ent and received with the greate&s;t Pomp and Splendor.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="April. 5." UNIT="date"> And now the Prince of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> with a Retinue and Equipage &s;uita|ble <MILESTONE N="1669" UNIT="date"> to his high Quality, and was at fir&s;t magnificently entertained by the King; but after &s;ome Time, he kept Hou&s;e at his own Expence, and had Plenty of all the porta|ble Rarities for Food and Drink, <HI>Italy</HI> had to afford. I dined with him twice; he was very kind to me, as he was to all tho&s;e who had travelled into <HI>Italy,</HI> and &s;poke the Lan|guage. And this Spring the Prince of <HI>Den|mark</HI> was in <HI>London,</HI> the &s;ame who &s;ome

 Years afterwards married the Prince&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Aug. 10." UNIT="date"> But all this Jollity was turned into Mourn|ing for the Death of the Queen Mother, who about this Time departed this Life at <HI>Paris:</HI> She was a great Prince&s;s, and my very good Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1670" UNIT="date"> This Summer the Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleans,</HI> the King's Si&s;ter, came over to <HI>Dover,</HI> where &s;he was met by the King, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and the whole Court. Here it was that &s;he confirmed his Highne&s;s the Duke in the Popi&s;h Super&s;tition, of which he had as yet been but barely &s;u&s;pected; and it is &s;aid to have been his grand Argument, for &s;uch his Adherence to tho&s;e Tenets, That his Mother had, upon her la&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing, com|manded him to be firm and &s;tedfa&s;t thereto. Before this, it was thought he was rather a Friend to the Presbyterians; for not long before, a Nonconformi&s;t Mini&s;ter be|ing pro&s;ecuted at <HI>Pomfret,</HI> for preaching in a Conventicle, it was reported that his Highne&s;s, and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> then principal Mini&s;ter of State, had writ|ten in his Favour to the Ju&s;tices: But the Duke as I was one Day attending on him in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park, called me to him, and di&s;cour&s;ing over the Thing to me, declared
<PB N="17" REF="20" MS="y">
what was reported to be a Mi&s;take, that he  had not concerned him&s;elf at all with it, tho' he was &s;o much a Friend to that Sort of People, that he could wi&s;h the Law had not been put in Execution again&s;t him, or to that Effect, and that ab&s;olutely he did not write. At the &s;ame Time he told me to repre&s;ent him, upon Occa&s;ion, as no E|nemy to &s;uch. Hereupon I acquainted his Highne&s;s, that there was a Kin&s;man of mine, one Mr. <HI>Vincent,</HI> in Town, who was a lead|ing Man of that Party; his Highne&s;s or|dered me to bring him to Court, which I did, and the Duke took him a&s;ide, and talked with him a great while. It was ge|nerally believed that the Duke, in this, acted the politician &s;uitable to the Time; for it was now rumoured about, the King would be divorced from his Queen, which, by thus courting all Parties, he propo&s;ed to prevent.</P>
<P>But however this was, our Royal Family lo&s;t another of its Number; for the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> had for &s;ome time before been jea|lous of his Wife, and, if all that is &s;aid be true, not without good Ground: The Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> it &s;eems, had been a Favourite with her, and now &s;he is &s;aid to have fallen in Love with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> while &s;he was at <HI>Dover;</HI> in &s;hort, Things were &s;o

<P><MILESTONE N="October." UNIT="date"> This Month the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came to <HI>London</HI> to pay a Vi&s;it to the King. The Parliament being now met, pur&s;uant to Pro|rogation, it hapned that Sir <HI>John Coventry,</HI> in a Speech he made, reflected on the King's Wenching; which being reported to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> he ordered Sir <HI>Thomas Sands</HI> (an Officer of the Guards) and three or four more, to way-lay him as he went late home to his Lodging; which they ac|cordingly did, and, taking him out of his Coach, &s;lit his No&s;e. But complaint there|of being made to the Hou&s;e, it cau&s;ed &s;uch a Heat, that thence proceeded the Act a|gain&s;t malicious Maiming and Wounding.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> remaining in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and making his Addre&s;&s;es to the Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> elde&s;t Daughter to the Duke, the King entertained him with great Splendor, as well on that Account, as becau&s;e of his Relation to him, and great per&s;onal Merit. One Night at a Supper, given by the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the King made him drink very hard: the Prince was naturally aver&s;e to it, but being once entered, was more frolic and gay than the re&s;t of the Compa|ny;

<P>The Parliament of the&s;e Days, had from the Beginning, which was &s;oon after the Re&s;toration, been perfectly well inclined to the King: They had given him a very great Revenue upon Tonnage and Poundage, as al&s;o by an Exci&s;e upon &s;everal Sorts of Liquors, Hearth-Money, not to mention Temporary Taxes, the whole amounting to above three times more than had been en|joyed by any King of <HI>England</HI> before. The Country groaned under this Pre&s;&s;ure, and began to be di&s;&s;atisfied; which having an Influence on &s;ome Gentlemen of both Hou&s;es, gave Birth to two Parties, the one for the Country, the other for the Court. The former pretended in an impartial Manner to e&s;pou&s;e the Cau&s;e of the People, in their Liberties and Properties, and whatever is dear to <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> to a&s;&s;ert the Religion and Government by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed: The latter pretended to the &s;ame, but thought the King was to have a competent Income, and be inve&s;ted with a due Power for the
<PB N="23" REF="26" MS="y">
Exerci&s;e of his regal Office, without having  too great a Dependance on the People, a Cau&s;e which had been of &s;uch pernicious Effects to his Royal Father. Hence it was that Gentlemen be&s;tirred them&s;elves more than u&s;ual to be elected into a Seat in Par|liament; &s;o that great was the Competition between the Candidates, and at great Ex|pences they were, even from One or Two Hundred, to Two Thou&s;and Pounds. But the Concerns of the Public were not what alone actuated all Men; &s;ome wanted to be in the Hou&s;e to be &s;creened from their Debts, this Parliament having &s;at a long while; and &s;ome had obtained great Emo|luments from the Court to &s;tand up for that Intere&s;t; &s;o that it is no wonder I had no le&s;s than five Competitors when I offered my&s;elf for <HI>Audborough.</HI> And not to drop this Matter here, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that Mr. <HI>Ben&s;on</HI> was the mo&s;t formidable of the five; a Man of no Birth, but who from a Clerk to a Country Attorney, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to be Clerk of the Peace at the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> Clerk of A&s;&s;ize of the Northern Circuit, as al&s;o to an E&s;tate of two thou&s;and five hun|dred Pounds, tho' not without &s;ome Reflec|tions on his Way of getting it.

 this Gentleman, and in the <HI>January</HI> follow|ing I moved the Hou&s;e to determine the Merit of the Return; but before a Hearing came on, a Prorogation intervened, &s;o that I had the Charge of bringing up Witne&s;&s;es, to no Manner of Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Towards the latter End of this Year the Duke declared his Marriage with <HI>Ma|ry,</HI> Daughter to the Duke of <HI>Modena,</HI> not long before arrived with the Duche&s;s her Mother.

<P><MILESTONE N="January" UNIT="date"> The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was now again in Di&s;grace, for which he was indebted to the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Lady, and now the mo&s;t ab&s;olute of all the King's Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; a very fine Woman &s;he was, but mo&s;t think &s;he was &s;ent on Purpo&s;e to en&s;nare the King, who mo&s;t readily ran in|to Toils of that Sort. His Grace in vain made U&s;e of the Mediation of the Lord Trea&s;urer: And to &s;ay the Truth, his Lord|&s;hip was not altogether &s;o zealous for his Grace as he ought to have been, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that it was to him he owed the White Staff he bore.

The King was at this time particularly <MILESTONE N="1674" UNIT="date"> di&s;plea&s;ed with his Grace, for that being &s;ummoned by the Hou&s;e of Commons to give an Account of &s;ome Malver&s;ations when he was Mini&s;ter; he did not only appear, being a Peer, and that without the King's Leave, but to excu&s;e him&s;elf reflected on others, and upon the whole, behaved in that A&s;&s;embly in too mean and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive a Manner; which however was of no avail to him again&s;t the Commons, who addre&s;&s;ed the King to lay him a&s;ide with regard to all Offices of Tru&s;t or Profit. His Grace was al&s;o called to the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Peers, for &s;candalou&s;ly living with the Lady <HI>Shrew&s;|bury</HI> as Man and Wife, he being a married Man, and for having killed my Lord <HI>Shrew&s;|bury</HI> after he had debauch'd his Wife.</P>

<P>Being thus received into the Hou&s;e, I found the two Parties in great Extremes

 again&s;t each other. The Court-&s;ide was very pre&s;&s;ing and urgent for Money for the King's pre&s;ent Occa&s;ions; the Country Par|ty thought of nothing le&s;s, except &s;ome Laws were enacted for the better Security of the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the grand Point of Property. But the two were &s;o equal that nothing more than Words pa&s;&s;ed between them; meer Words without any Effect, for neither dared &s;tand the Chance <MILESTONE N="May 15." UNIT="date"> of a Que&s;tion put. In the mid&s;t of this, Doctor <HI>Shirley</HI> prefers a Petition to the Hou&s;e of Lords again&s;t Sir <HI>John Fag,</HI> a Member of the Lower Hou&s;e, to appear and an&s;wer in a Cau&s;e he had brought before the Lords, and a Summons was &s;ent to Sir <HI>John,</HI> accordingly; which the Commons con&s;ider|ing as a Breach of Privilege, great Heats aro&s;e among them, and high Expre&s;&s;ions be|ing, upon this Occa&s;ion, mutually vented again&s;t each other by both Hou&s;es, the King thought fit to adjourn their Time of Sitting for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="October." UNIT="date"> They no &s;ooner &s;at again than my Com|petitor <HI>Ben&s;on,</HI> and another, Mr. <HI>Long,</HI> pe|titioned again&s;t me. They would have had a &s;hort Day, but it was my Bu&s;ine&s;s to get as long a one as I could, and I accordingly did &s;o. In &s;hort, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="30" MS="y">
was of &s;uch Con&s;equence, that the Proro|gation  came on before our Cau&s;e could be heard. I took a particular Account of what was tran&s;acted this Se&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t extra|ordinary Particulars of which were &s;umma|rily the&s;e.</P>
<P>The King had in his Speech acquainted us, That he was four Millions in Debt, ex|clu&s;ive of what he owed to the God&s;miths or Bankers, a va&s;t Sum more, for which he paid neither Principal nor Intere&s;t, to the Ruin of many Families. It being upon this put to the Vote whether Money &s;hould be given or not, It was carried in the Nega|tive by four Voices, and that, when near four hundred Members were in the Hou&s;e. But it appearing that both the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> exceeded us in the Proportion and Number of their Shipping, a Sum of Three Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds was voted to the King for the Building of twenty Ships, namely, One of the Fir&s;t Rate, Five of the Second, and Fourteen of the Third.</P>
<P>Several Ways were debated for the Rai|&s;ing of this Sum, as upon Land, upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> by Way of Poll, or upon <HI>French</HI> Commodities, and la&s;tly upon our own Con|&s;umption, and upon Merchandi&s;e. At length it was to be levied upon Land, and paid in
<PB N="28" REF="31" MS="y">
 eighteen Months; to be lodged apart in the Exchequer, and appropriated to that particular U&s;e, with very &s;evere Penalties upon the Officers that &s;hould apply it to any other: But the Sum it&s;elf, the time it was to be rai&s;ed in, and other Circum&s;tances, were by no means grateful to the Court. It was farther voted That the Cu&s;toms having been formerly given to the King for the Maintenance of the Fleet, a Clau&s;e to that effect and purpo&s;e &s;hould be in&s;erted in this Bill, or a new one prepared to confirm it.</P>
<P>The State of the Fleet was now given in, whereby it appeared that we had no more than eight Fir&s;t Rates, nine Second Rates, and forty Three Third Rates; while the <HI>French</HI> exceeded us in the Number of the&s;e Rates by &s;ix and twenty, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> by fourteen.</P>
<P>It was moreover voted that the Athei&s;m, Debauchery, and Impiety of the pre&s;ent Age be in&s;erted, as Grievances to be redre&s;|&s;ed: And it being violently &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome Members of the Hou&s;e did receive Gratuities from the Court to Vote on that &s;ide; it was put that a Committee &s;hould be appointed to form a Kind of Oath or Te&s;t, to di&s;cover what Sums of Money and Offices had been given to Parliament Men to gain their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32" MS="y">
The <HI>French</HI> Trade al&s;o was complained of,  as being Thirteen Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds an overbalance for ours; and upon the Matter it appeared, that every Thou|&s;and Pounds a Year had &s;ince the Re&s;tora|tion paid a Hundred Pounds in Taxes to the Crown.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o voted a Grievance, that Ju&s;|tices of the Peace &s;hould be &s;ummoned to appear before the Council, to account for what they did in their judicial Capacity.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Novemb." UNIT="date"> The Bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o of <HI>Luzance</HI> took up &s;ome time in the Hou&s;e. This <HI>Luzance</HI> was a <HI>French</HI> Je&s;uit, but becoming a Convert to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> inveighed again&s;t the Fallacies of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in a Ser|mon he preached in the <HI>French</HI> Church in the <HI>Savoy.</HI> This alarmed the Papi&s;ts, and particularly one Doctor <HI>Burnet,</HI> a Je&s;uit, and Confe&s;&s;or to the Duche&s;s of <HI>York,</HI> who finding him alone in his Chamber, and po&s;t|ing Three Men at the Door, threatned to murder him if he did not make Satisfaction for the Injury, eat his Words, and &s;peedily return to <HI>France.</HI> The Man in this de&s;|perate Dilemma promi&s;ed faithfully what|ever was required of him, 'till he got his Liberty, when pre&s;ently going to Doctor <HI>Breval,</HI> a converted Je&s;uit as well as him|&s;elf,
<PB N="30" REF="33" MS="y">
 he told him the whole Story; <HI>Breval</HI> the next Day acquainted me with it, and I communicated it to the Hou&s;e. The Com|mons took Fire at this, and &s;trait appointed a Committee to examine into the Matter, and ordered me to produce <HI>Luzance</HI> the next Day. He appeared accordingly, and averred the Thing for a Truth. This was the fir&s;t time I pre&s;umed to &s;peak in that great A&s;&s;embly, or in any Committee; but the next Day I was obliged to do it &s;everal times in what concerned this violent Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the Report made from the Com|mittee to the Hou&s;e, my Lord <HI>Cavendi&s;h</HI> cal|led me up to give an Account of &s;ome other things I had had from <HI>Luzance.</HI> One was that Two <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants, being Mer|chants of great Sub&s;tance and Credit, had been threatned by certain Papi&s;ts, that if they were not le&s;s &s;evere upon the Ro|mani&s;ts, they &s;hould ere long &s;ee the Pro|te&s;tant Blood flow in <HI>London</HI> Streets. A Committee was appointed to enquire into the Truth of this Matter; and <HI>Luzance</HI> be|ing &s;ummoned, gave Evidence to the very &s;elf &s;ame Effect, and gave it under his own Hand. The Parties he had his Information from being &s;ent for, appeared al&s;o, and de|clared
<PB N="31" REF="34">
&s;uch Threats to have been u&s;ed to|wards  them by &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Papi&s;ts; but, to what Cau&s;e it was owing is uncertain, they gave in only &s;uch Names as were of Per&s;ons either ab&s;ent, or of no E&s;timation; &s;o that little came of this Bu&s;ine&s;s. But the&s;e and other &s;uch Informations, concerning the Height and In&s;olence of the Papi&s;ts, did &s;o exa&s;perate the Hou&s;e, that many Motions were made to humble them. Some were for a &s;peedy Confinement of them to the Coun|try, others for Bani&s;hment, and &s;ome again for di&s;arming them, and the like.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after, the Matter of Doctor <HI>Shirley</HI>'s Petition to the Lords again&s;t Sir <HI>John Fag,</HI> was again renewed, tho' it had broke up the Parliament the la&s;t time. There were tho&s;e who thought the King had con&s;ented to it, di&s;liking the warm Pro|ceedings of both Hou&s;es: While others were of Opinion that the Lords of the Country Intere&s;t had per&s;uaded the Doctor thereto, with a View thereby to kindle &s;uch a Flame between the two Hou&s;es, that the King &s;hould be obliged either to prorogue, adjourn, or di&s;&s;olve them: The &s;aid Lords apprehending that if this Parliament &s;hould &s;it much longer, the Majority might be gained over by Money and Places, &s;o as to
<PB N="32" REF="35" MS="y">
 become quite ob&s;equious to the Court; and this My Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> (then in the Intere&s;t of Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> his Uncle, who was upon ill Terms with the Court, being no longer Lord Chancellor) told me was his Opinion.</P>
<P>But whatever the Cau&s;e was, the Effect was &s;uch That the Commons refu&s;ing to let their Member plead at the Bar of the Lords during a Time of Privilege, it was re&s;olved That the Lords by receiving an Appeal from any Court, either of Law or Equity, again&s;t a Member of the Lower Hou&s;e, du|ring a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, were thereby Infringers of the Privileges of the Commons of <HI>England;</HI> and that &s;uch Lawyers as &s;hould attend as Coun&s;el to plead in any &s;uch Cau&s;e at the Lords Bar, &s;hould be deemed as Be|trayers of the Rights of the Commons of <HI>England;</HI> and that the &s;aid Vote be affixed to the Door of the Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> and the Inns of Court; which was accordingly done: And the &s;ame Day it was voted by the Lords, that the &s;ame was Illegal and Unparliamentary, and tended to the Di&s;&s;olution of the Go|vernment: And upon the whole, that they would not recede from their Right of Ju|dicature by Appeals from the Courts of Equity.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36" MS="y">
It was then put to the Que&s;tion, If the  King &s;hould not be petitioned to di&s;&s;olve this Parliament, and it was carried in the Negative by no more than Two Votes.</P>
<P>This Mi&s;under&s;tanding between the Hou&s;es was very di&s;&s;atisfactory to the King. The Lords who had voted for the Di&s;&s;olu|tion of this Parliament, entered their Pro|te&s;t in the Journal of their Hou&s;e, together with their Rea&s;ons &s;or &s;o doing; &s;o that Things being at this Pa&s;s, the only Expe|dient left, was to di&s;mi&s;s the Parliament, which the King did, by Prorogation to the 10th of <HI>February</HI> next.</P>

The Coroner accordingly &s;um|mons a Jury, and does his Office; but when they came to uncover the Brea&s;t, it was &s;o putrified they would go no further; &s;o that upon the Examination of Eleven Witne&s;&s;es, &s;ome that laid him out, and &s;ome that &s;aw him naked, &s;everal, becau&s;e of his Colour, having a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee him after he was dead, they gave their Verdict, that he died <HI>Ex Vi&s;itatione Dei,</HI> by the Hand of God.</P>

<P>A black and mo&s;t ridiculous Piece of Ma|lice this; for had their Sugge&s;tion been prov|ed a Fact, all their Art could never have &s;o fix|ed it, as to have indangered either my Per&s;on or E&s;tate.

 &s;o and &s;o of the King, and upon &s;uch Con|ditions promi&s;ed to come over.</P>

<P>The Conde&s;cen&s;ion of the King, in giving this Satisfaction to &s;o mean a Per&s;on, con|vinced me very much of the Truth of what he &s;aid; as did al&s;o his natural Temper and Con&s;titution; for he was not an active, bu&s;y, or ambitious Prince, but perfectly a Friend to Ea&s;e, and fond of Plea&s;ure; he &s;eemed to be chiefly de&s;irous of Peace and Quiet for his own Time.</P>

Upon this Occa&s;ion I declar|ed that at the Time I &s;aw him, he laboured under all the Symptoms of Lunacy and Di|&s;traction.

<P>My An&s;wer to this Me&s;&s;age was, That I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the Compliment from a Gen|tleman to whom I intended none, what I had &s;aid having been with a due Regard to Truth: That however I was not &s;orry I had happened to oblige his Lord&s;hip by it; and that &s;ince he had denied all concern in the iniquitous Affair of my dead Servant, I would prevent his Lord&s;hip, and wait on him my &s;elf; as I did two or three Days afterwards. He received me with all the Civility and Kindne&s;s imaginable, and wi&s;hed that nei|ther him&s;elf or Pro&s;perity might pro&s;per, if he was any way aiding or a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the Plot laid again&s;t me.

<P>I very often vi&s;ited and dined with my Lord Trea&s;urer, and often waited on the King, who, when he &s;aw me, would ask

His Maje&s;ty would pa&s;s their Bills; a Me&s;|&s;age  that was accordingly delivered.</P>
<P>My Lord Trea&s;urer &s;ent for me among o|thers, de&s;iring us to a&s;&s;i&s;t what we could, towards the Reconciliation of a Difference likely to take place between the two Hou&s;es, about framing the Bill for the &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Pounds, to be given to the King, which might endanger the Lo&s;s of the &s;ame: For the Commons had made a Clau&s;e there|in, injoining the Officers of the Exchequer to give them an Account of the Disbur&s;ment and Di&s;tribution of the &s;aid Sum; while the Lords had a&s;&s;erted they &s;hould be accounta|ble to both Hou&s;es. This the Commons would not &s;uffer, alledging the Lords could neither add to nor take away from a Mo|ney-Bill; for that as it was peculiar to them only to give Money, it was to them only that Account was to be given how it was ap|plied. The Lords to this replied, That to de|ny them the Power of calling the Officers of the Exchequer to a Reckoning, was to abridge them of the Privilege of Judicature they un|doubtedly had as the &s;upreme Court; and by way of Precedent ob&s;erved, That when the Convention gave Money for the Disbanding of the Army, an Account of the &s;ame was or|dered to be laid before their Hou&s;e as well
<PB N="46" REF="49" MS="y">
 as the other. They both adhered tenaci|ou&s;ly to their Point, till the King at length prevailed with the Lords to era&s;e their Clau&s;e; and &s;o the Commons got the better of the Day.</P>
<P>It was not long before this, That the King of <HI>France,</HI> having obtained a Victory over the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> did in his Return by <HI>Calais</HI> &s;end over the Duke of <HI>Crequy,</HI> and the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Rheims,</HI> to pay a Com|pliment to our King, who returned it by my Lord <HI>Sunderland.</HI> This gave ju&s;t Cau&s;e to think there would be no War between the two Kings, contrary to what the Parliament had &s;o earne&s;tly advi&s;ed. I &s;aw a Copy of the Letter the&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors brought with them; beginning with this Stile or Title, <HI>Tres haut, tres Excellent &amp; tres Pui&s;&s;ent Prince, tres cher tres aim&eacute; bon Fr&eacute;re Cou&s;in &amp; Alli&eacute;:</HI> And in truth our King's Neutrality de&s;erved all this from <HI>France,</HI> and much more.</P>

His Lord&s;hip was upon this Occa&s;ion &s;o o|pen with me as to tell me, That tho' the King denied &s;carce any thing to the Duke, his Brother, he certainly did not love him at his Heart.</P>
<P>He told me al&s;o That the King had no mind to fall out with <HI>France;</HI> and that if the Parliament would effectually engage him in that War, their Way would be to furni&s;h him with Sums of Money to prepare for it, and that no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Pounds would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for that Purpo&s;e. That if the King accepted of this, he would be obliged to carry on the War; but that if the Parliament would not tru&s;t him, he was in the right not to em|bark him&s;elf, and might ju&s;tly argue, <HI>How can I depend on my Parliament to furni&s;h me with regular and equal Supplies to carry on a War, which they will not &s;o much as enable me to prepare for?</HI> But I ea&s;ily &s;aw through this; I plainly perceived it was all Artifice to get the fingering of Money.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51" MS="y">
 He moreover &s;aid, That the King could not in Honour join the Confederates again&s;t <HI>France:</HI> That in all the Treaties the King of <HI>England</HI> had been mentioned as Principal in the War: That in the Beginning he did actually join with <HI>France,</HI> and that for him now to turn his Arms again&s;t that Crown, would look neither ju&s;t nor honourable in the Eye of the World. This his Lord&s;hip told me was the King's own Way of argu|ing, whenever War hapned to be the Sub|ject of their Di&s;cour&s;e together; but that his An&s;wer to his Maje&s;ty was, That he needed not be &s;o regardful of that Tran&s;action, the <HI>French</HI> King having plaid him the very &s;ame Trick when Chancellor <HI>Hyde</HI> was chief Mi|ni&s;ter. To this he replied, That the <HI>French</HI> King had a Pique again&s;t the Lord Chan|cellor: To which the Trea&s;urer &s;ubjoined, That whatever was the Cau&s;e, the thing was as he had &s;aid.</P>
<P>He was &s;o free al&s;o as to tell me &s;till fur|ther, That the Duke was the Grand Promo|ter of the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, and that he now made his Court to the Sectaries and Fana|ticks, only to give Strength and Vigour to the Popi&s;h Intere&s;t: That his Highne&s;s was &s;o very a Bigot, that tho' the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Rheims</HI> made no Scruple to go into our
<PB N="49" REF="52" MS="y">
Churches, and even kneel down during the  Time of divine Service, the Duke at the &s;ame time could not be prevailed on &s;o much as to &s;tep within the Doors. He ob&s;erved that the Duke was particularly unhappy in his Servants, a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Pack; but that in|deed his Confe&s;&s;or was a notable Man, and one that had a great Influence over him; being as well as his Ma&s;ter aver&s;e to a War with <HI>France.</HI> His Lord&s;hip however declared him&s;elf for it.</P>
<P>The next Day I went to vi&s;it the Duke and Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lautherdale,</HI> at their fine Hou&s;e at <HI>Ham.</HI> After Dinner, her Grace en|tertained me in her Chamber with much Di&s;|cour&s;e upon Affairs of State.

<P>Upon this I prevailed with my Lord Trea&s;urer to go with me to the King, of whom I begged two Things, namely, That he would be plea&s;ed to order Mr. Secretary <HI>William&s;on</HI> to eraze a <HI>Caveat</HI> that had been en|tered with him, upon his Maje&s;ty's granting away my E&s;tate to Mr. <HI>Felton,</HI> reputed to be forfeited by my pretended felonious Pra|ctices with the Blackamoor that died in my Service: And that al&s;o he would be plea&s;ed to lay his Commands upon my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Rainsford,</HI> to di&s;cover to me at who&s;e Sollicitation, or upon what Sugge&s;tion it was his Lord&s;hip i&s;&s;ued out his Warrant to the Coroner to take up the Body after it had been &s;o long interred.</P>

<P>It was, at this Time, generally believed that Peace was concluded between us, the Confederates, and the King of <HI>France.</HI> We blamed the States for their ready Comply|ance; the States blamed the <HI>Spaniard</HI> who was full of his Offers, while he had neither Men, Arms, or Money in <HI>Flanders</HI> to defend it; and they both fell upon the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> who when they &s;hould have given Money; and made other Preparations for the War, were wa&s;ting their Time in quarrelling at home with the Government, and with each other.</P>
<P>The Parliament met, pur&s;uant to adjourn|ment, when the King &s;poke to them a little <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="date"> more briskly than u&s;ual.

 his Speech, it was owing to their Refu&s;al of Money, till &s;omething was done for the Se|curity of their Religion; their Negligence to direct or advi&s;e him concerning the in|tended War, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t him till he had changed Councellors, and con&s;equently the little Hopes the Confederates could have of Help from him; that this, together with the low Condition of <HI>Spain,</HI> had prompted them to lend an Ear to the Offers of Peace; not to &s;peak of the &s;luggi&s;h Motion of the <HI>Germans,</HI> the Difficulty of getting them to|gether, their Princes being influenced by &s;uch di&s;cordant Views and Intere&s;ts, and the pre&s;ent Poverty of the States General, all which had contributed towards the Ce&s;|&s;ation of the War.</P>
<P>But &s;till our King was chiefly condemned in this great Affair, as he &s;o long deferred to engage in this Alliance; which, had he &s;ooner done, the <HI>French</HI> King had never dared to per&s;i&s;t in the War; at lea&s;t he could not have made &s;o great a Progre&s;s in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> or have been able to make &s;o good a Market for him&s;elf, as he did by this Peace.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="Nov. 6, 7."

<P>To pa&s;s over other Things more generally known, a Jealou&s;y now &s;eemed to ari&s;e be|tween the Duke and the Lord Trea&s;urer. The Duke thought his Lord&s;hip was within him&s;elf for his leaving the Court, that &s;o he might have the King the more ab&s;olutely in his own Power: And my Lord (tho' I be|lieve he endeavoured to &s;erve the Duke all he could, tho' no Friend to his Religion)
<PB N="71" REF="74" MS="y">
re&s;ented the Duke's Su&s;picion. Much was,  at this time, done and tran&s;acted, in disfa|vour <MILESTONE N="Nov. 13."

<P>The Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI>'s Re&s;ident had, it &s;eems, reported the Lord Trea&s;urer to be in the Pay and Pen&s;ion of <HI>France.</HI> Thus, at lea&s;t, had his Lord&s;hip been informed, and &s;ending for him, he &s;ent for me al&s;o to be pre&s;ent at the Examination; but the Re&s;i|dent ab&s;olutely denied what was laid to his Charge. To make amends for this, I, a few Days after, acquainted his Lord&s;hip, That the &s;ame Gentleman had a&s;&s;ured me, the Commons would mo&s;t certainly fall up|on him, and that it was in his Power to turn the Edge of one that was mo&s;t violent again&s;t him.

<P>In preparing the Bill for purging the Hou&s;e of Lords of &s;uch as refu&s;ed the new Te&s;t, it was put to the Que&s;tion, Whether or no his Royal Highne&s;s &s;hould be excu&s;ed from taking it, and it was carried in the affirmative, but by no more than two Votes: Had it been carried in the negative, he would, in the next Place, have been voted

<P><MILESTONE N="Decem. 1." UNIT="date"> Having proceeded thus far, the Commons voted an Addre&s;s to the King, from that Hou&s;e, to repre&s;ent the ill State of the Na|tion, and the Danger it was in, by his Ma|je&s;ty's adhering to private Councils rather than to his two Hou&s;es of Parliament: This aimed at my Lord Trea&s;urer, and &s;ome o|thers of the Cabinet Council. This was car|ried by two and twenty Votes, and even &s;ome of the Courtiers were for it; whence it was by &s;ome &s;urmi&s;ed, That the Duke, being no longer in Councils, was grown jealous of the Trea&s;urer, and had a mind he &s;hould be removed. It was now &s;aid the Duke had been per&s;uaded (but unju&s;tly) that his Lord&s;hip endeavoured to in&s;inuate into the King, that there was &s;omething of Pro|bability in the Accu&s;ation again&s;t the Queen, purely that he might hearken to a Divorce, and marry another more likely to bring Chil|dren to the Crown.</P>
<P>The Commons were now intent upon di&s;|banding the Army, rai&s;ing of Money for that Purpo&s;e, and the Conviction of Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants; during which the Right of the Lords to interfere in a Money-Bill was

UNIT="date"> nice a Subject, the King cau&s;ed Mr. <HI>Mon|tague</HI>'s Papers to be &s;eized, and acquainted the Hou&s;e of Commons, That having been his Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>French</HI> Court, he had taken on him to treat with the Pope's Nun|cio, without any Commi&s;&s;ion from him for &s;o doing; and that he had &s;eized his Papers to come at the Purport of the &s;aid Treaty. But <HI>Montague</HI> a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e, that this was a mere Artifice, a Contrivance of the Trea&s;urer's to &s;ave him&s;elf; but that his Lord&s;hip had therein failed, for that altho' mo&s;t of his Letters were &s;eized, he had by good Look &s;aved the mo&s;t material. One of them, dated the 25th of <HI>March</HI> 1678, in|&s;tructed him to acquaint that Court with the great Difficulties he met withal here in the Affair of Peace between us and them, and the Fear there was the Parliament &s;hould di&s;|cover it: That however he had Orders from the King to bid him treat with them for a Peace, as well between them and the Confe|derates, as our &s;elves; upon Condition, the <HI>French</HI> King would give ours &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Livers <HI>per Annum,</HI> for three Years together, after the Conclu&s;ion of the Peace&punc; for that as our King would thereby di&s;gu&s; the Parliament, he could expect no Money

<P><HI>Danby.</HI></P>
<P>This put the Hou&s;e into a Flame, and a Motion was in&s;tantly made, that the Trea|&s;urer &s;hould be impeach'd of High Trea&s;on; for that he had endeavoured to e&s;trange the King from his Parliament, and make it of no U&s;e to him; and one Mr. <HI>Powel</HI> ob&s;erv|ed, That this was u&s;urping a Power to the Exclu&s;ion of other Councellors, who had a Right to advi&s;e the King as well as him&s;elf; the very Trea&s;on that was laid to the Charge of the <HI>Spencers,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Days of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>But it was an&s;wered, That it was no &s;uch great Offence to write this by the King's own Order, as was expre&s;&s;ed in the Letter it &s;elf, and would be owned, as &s;uppo&s;ed, by the King at this Time. That the King had certainly a Power to advi&s;e with which of his Councellors he plea&s;ed; and that if his Maje&s;ty fore&s;aw the Confederates would &s;trike up a Peace, which we mu&s;t comply with, where was the Harm of making what Advantage we could of it to our &s;elves, and at the &s;ame Time of &s;paring the Pur&s;es of the Subject?</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79" MS="y">
 A &s;econd Letter was produced, which gave A&s;&s;urance of Inclinations for a very fair Un|der&s;tanding between us and his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty; together with Advice to ha&s;ten the Peace; becau&s;e the Duke &s;eemed every Day more and more aver&s;e to it; and mentioned &s;ome Towns to be given up, by the <HI>French,</HI> as cautionary, to the Confederates, upon the Conclu&s;ion of this Peace. Mr. <HI>Montague</HI> then declared in the Hou&s;e, That the <HI>French</HI> King was willing to deliver up two Towns more than he did by the former Treaty; but that my Lord Trea&s;urer was &s;o earne&s;t and pre&s;&s;ing for Money, that he thereby made the Terms much wor&s;e for the Confederates; but at the &s;ame Time acknowledged he could not &s;ay he knew of any Money paid either to him or to his Maje&s;ty. Other Things were now laid to the Trea&s;urer's Charge, as the Male-admini&s;tration of his Office, and the Lowne&s;s of the Exchequer: But to this it was an&s;wered, by his Lord&s;hip's Friends, That a Debt of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Pounds had been paid off &s;ince he had been in Office, tho' no Money had in all that Time been given to the King, but what had been ap|propriated to the U&s;es de&s;igned.</P>
<P>He was farther accu&s;ed, (this Letter bear|ing Date the 25th of <HI>March</HI> 1678, and the

<P>Mr. <HI>Montague</HI> was, in this Ca&s;e, ju&s;tly cen&s;ured, for di&s;clo&s;ing what had pa&s;&s;ed through his Hands, when a public Mini&s;ter, without the King's Leave.

 But a Debate aro&s;e, whether, &s;uppo&s;ing any of the&s;e Articles to be true, they amount|ed to High Trea&s;on, none of them being within the Statute of <HI>Edward</HI> III. At length the Que&s;tion being put, Whether or no an Impeachment of High Trea&s;on, founded up|on the &s;aid Articles again&s;t his Lord&s;hip, &s;hould be carried up to the Hou&s;e of Lords, <MILESTONE N="Dec. 23."

<P>The Commons began to be angry with the Trea&s;urer, for that the Speaker they had propo&s;ed had been rejected by the King; &s;aying he was the cau&s;e of it, becau&s;e, truly, the Gentleman was not his Lord&s;hip's Friend.

<P>The Storm now begins to fall heavy upon the Lord Trea&s;urer, in&s;omuch that he has Thoughts of delivering up his Staff, and with it his Office, in hopes by &s;uch Re&s;ignation to allay the Heats again&s;t him.

<P>Some would have pe&s;uaded his Lord&s;hip to take Refuge abroad, as what would ap|pea&s;e both Hou&s;es: And indeed the Lords had a Conference with the Commons about preparing a Bill to bani&s;h him, and the Com|mons de&s;ired &s;ome Days to con&s;ider of it, in hopes he would have withdrawn in that <MILESTONE N="March 24."

<P>A mo&s;t unhappy thing it is to &s;erve a fickle Prince, which, it mu&s;t be owned, was Part of our Ma&s;ter's Character.

It was replied, that this Expedient was by far more to be avoided than the former; that it was depriving the Duke of his Birthright; that if his Highne&s;s &s;urvived, he had as clear a Claim to &s;ucceed the King, if he died Childle&s;s, as any Man whatever had to &s;uc|ceed to his Father's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; that proba|bly a Prince of his Spirit would not ea&s;ily &s;ubmit to be &s;o di&s;inherited; that &s;uch a Di|&s;turbance of the Succe&s;&s;ion had never, in this Kingdom, been of any la&s;ting Effect; that Right had always prevailed at la&s;t; that Ci|vil Wars, upon the like Occa&s;ions had been di&s;a&s;trous to <HI>England;</HI> that Succe&s;s would rever&s;e all Attainder; and that &s;hould his Highne&s;s force his way to the Crown, the overthrow of Religion and Government were more, much more, to be feared, than by his peaceful Acce&s;&s;ion.</P>

He was impeached by the Commons, and being deemed to be weaker than the other Lords in the Tower, for the &s;ame Crime, and le&s;s able to labour his De|fence, was purpo&s;ely marked out to be the fir&s;t brought on; but he deceived them &s;o far as to plead his Cau&s;e to a Miracle.

He heard his Accu&s;ers, and defended him&s;elf with great Steadine&s;s and Re&s;olution, and re|ceived his Sentence with great Courage and Compo&s;ure; nor did he &s;toop beneath the Weight of his Doom, till he &s;ubmitted his Head to the Block, with his la&s;t Breath pro|te&s;ting his Innocence, and the cruel Wrong he &s;uffered.

That if for the future the King &s;hould have Occa&s;ion for him, in any thing that was ju&s;t, he &s;hould be ready to &s;erve him: That if I would repo&s;e a Confidence in him, he would let me know when it was Time to appear for the King's Service, and that I &s;hould &s;hare Fortunes with him, and &s;o on.

<P>Not to in&s;i&s;t on the Impeachment of <HI>Fitz-harris,</HI> which was done not to de&s;troy, but to &s;erve him in oppo&s;ition to the Court; the grand Argument for the Bill of Exclu&s;ion

was, That nothing could pre&s;erve us from  Popery but that alone. Now the whole Hou&s;e was of Opinion, that Popery was to be kept out, the Di&s;pute was only as to the Means of effecting it. The King had, in his Speech, offered to agree to any thing that might &s;erve to quiet the Minds of the People as to that particular, the utter Exclu|&s;ion of his Brother only excepted. It was therefore moved by Sir <HI>Thomas Littleton,</HI> That a Bill, to &s;ecure the Prote&s;tant Religi|on, &s;hould be brought in, and con&s;i&s;t of the following Heads; That the Duke of <HI>York</HI> &s;hould enjoy the Title, and the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> exerci&s;e the Power. That if a Par|liament &s;hould be in Being, when it &s;hould plea&s;e God to take away the pre&s;ent King, they &s;hould have Power to &s;it: That the Judges, and all other Officers of the Crown, &s;hould be continued, till Liberty and Pro|perty were &s;ecured: That if there was no Parliament &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, one &s;hould a&s;&s;emble of Cour&s;e: And that to prevent the Duke's interfering to prevent this, he &s;hould, by the &s;ame Act, be bani&s;hed to the Di&s;tance of 500 Miles from <HI>England,</HI> not to return as long as the King lived. To this it was objected, That the Name and Power of King were in&s;eparable by the Laws
<PB N="118" REF="121" MS="y">
<MILESTONE N="1681" UNIT="date"> of <HI>England;</HI> that the Father would &s;oon find a way to dive&s;t the Daughter of her Power; that a Regency was never known but in Ca&s;es of Lunacy and Minority; and that the Duke was not of a turn of Di&s;po&s;ition to be ea&s;ily governed.

Some of the adver&s;e &s;ide, had, in the Hou&s;e, bab|bled out, That the Bill of Exclu&s;ion was not the only material Bill they intended to get pa&s;&s;ed this Se&s;&s;ion, in order to &s;ecure the People of <HI>England</HI> from falling a Prey to Po|pery, and arbitrary Power: That it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary the Military and Civil Power too &s;hould be lodged in other Hands, and that the pre&s;ent Officers of both &s;hould be called to an Account and changed: Whence the King being told, That if he quitted his Bro|ther, it would be but an immediate Step taken to ruin all his Friends and Servants, and to become him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the Will and Wi&s;hes of tho&s;e, whom he had no Rea|&s;on to think were over and above affected to him, the King dreaded the Con&s;equences, and re&s;olved accordingly.</P>
<P>I was at the King's Couch&eacute;e, as I was

 three Times in one Week; his Di&s;cour&s;e ran <MILESTONE N="April 20."

And now we begin to have a Pro&s;pect of Halcyon Days again; for his Maje&s;ty having, &s;ince the la&s;t Parliament was di&s;&s;olved, i&s;&s;ued out a Declaration fraught with the faire&s;t Pro|mi&s;es to his People, and a&s;&s;uring them of his firm Intentions to govern inviolably accord|ing to Law, and the like; it had &s;o happy an Effect, that he received the Thanks of the City of <HI>London,</HI> by the Lord Mayor, and of &s;everal Counties and Corporations in <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>

The &s;ame Day, one of the under Secretaries told me, the King was re|&s;olved to pro&s;ecute him to the utmo&s;t, and that there was no want of very &s;ufficient Matter again&s;t him.</P>

to ob&s;erve by the way, that my Lord <HI>Halli|fax,</HI>  being by no means a Friend to <HI>France,</HI> was upon no good footing with the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> which gave the King &s;ome Trouble, as it proved a Hindrance to the Currency of his Affairs; wherefore he &s;ought <MILESTONE N="Nov. 20."

He &s;poke not him&s;elf, but did it by the Lord Chancellor, and or|dered them to be more vigilant, mindful, and active for the time to come.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day, having been to vi&s;it the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> my Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> took me home with him from <HI>Whitehall.</HI> On the Way, I acquainted him that the general Report was, That his Lord&s;hip oppo&s;ed the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Intere&s;t with the King, and his Return from <HI>Scotland,</HI> which his High|ne&s;s mo&s;t urgently pre&s;&s;ed. His Reply was, That it was well if the Duke's overha&s;tine&s;s did not turn to his Di&s;advantage; that his Highne&s;s had a &s;ort of hungry Servants a|bout him, who were eternally pre&s;&s;ing for his Return, nor would ever let him be at re&s;t, till, with a View to their own Intere&s;t, they put their Ma&s;ter upon what might prove much to his Prejudice. And true it is that whil&s;t his Highne&s;s was near the King's Per&s;on, every Body believed his Maje&s;ty to be principally &s;wayed and actuated by his
<PB N="130" REF="133">
 Advice; and con&s;equently That Popi&s;h Councils were then uppermo&s;t; whereas he did a great deal of good in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by keeping a watchful Eye over that mutinous Kingdom. But the Papi&s;ts, and others, his Highne&s;&s;es Creatures, pretended he was kept in <HI>Scotland</HI> That his Enemies might the more ea&s;ily work him out of his Brother's good Opinion; and that the Mini&s;ters might have the King all to them&s;elves, and guide him according to their own Will and Plea|&s;ure. Upon this Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> ob&s;erved There was great Partiality in the Judgment of Men; for that in common Ju&s;tice they ought to take as much Notice of Things that were managed for the Duke's Advan|tage, as of what &s;eemed to be otherwi&s;e: That, for In&s;tance, no Body had commend|ed the Mini&s;ters for getting the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> to be Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e in pre|judice to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> tho' it mu&s;t prove a great Ob&s;tacle to his Return to the King's Per&s;on, and tho' mo&s;t evident it was That no greater Service could be done to his Highne&s;s, than to keep the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI> from Court.</P>
<P>About this Time I had a View of going <MILESTONE N="Jan. 4." UNIT="date"> Envoy to <HI>Denmark,</HI> but to wave that, I this Day carried a Gentleman, one Mr. <HI>Grant,</HI> a

At the &s;ame time I conducted a Gentleman to my Lord, to ask his Pardon for &s;ome Things he had been reported to have &s;aid again&s;t his Lord|&s;hip. In good Policy, we ought to &s;uffer no Man to be our Enemy, if we can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it; but &s;uch was his Lord&s;hip's natural Di&s;po&s;ition, that, in the whole Cour&s;e of my Life, I never knew a Man more ready, at all Times, to forgive, and &s;hall never forget his Expre&s;&s;ion upon this Occa&s;ion, <HI>Sir, if you did not &s;ay the Words I am very glad of it, and even if you did, I am glad you find Cau&s;e to be of another Mind.</HI> In a private Conver|&s;ation I, at the &s;ame time, had with his Lord&s;hip, he told me, That the People about the Duke of <HI>York</HI> made him mad; that there was &s;carce one of them that had a Grain of Sen&s;e; and intimated that a Parliament could not be far off.</P>

<P>I &s;everal Times afterwards attended on the King, both in private and in Council, from time to time to give him Information, as fre&s;h matter occurred, or appeared; and upon the whole it was di&s;covered, partly by the Confe&s;&s;ion of the Parties concerned, and partly by the Information of others, That the <HI>German</HI> Captain had been for eight Years an Intimate with Count <HI>Coning&s;mark,</HI> one of the greate&s;t Men in the Kingdom of <HI>Sweden,</HI> his Uncle being at that time Governor of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and near upon marrying the King's Aunt; and moreover that during the Time he was in <HI>England</HI> before, he had made his Addre&s;&s;es to Lady <HI>Ogle,</HI> the only Daugh|ter and Heire&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Northumber|land,</HI> who had been marryed to the deceas'd Mr. <HI>Thynn,</HI> and that the &s;aid Count had re&s;ent|ed &s;omething as an Affront from Mr. <HI>Thynn:</HI> That the Captain, moved thereto out of pure Friend&s;hip to the Count, tho' not at all with

<P><MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="date"> A few Days afterwards, Mon&s;. <HI>Foubert</HI> who kept the Academy in <HI>London,</HI> came and de&s;ired me to put him in a way how to &s;ave Count <HI>Coning&s;mark</HI>'s Life, in&s;inuating to me, That as he was a Man of va&s;t Fortune, he could not make a better U&s;e of it than to &s;upport his own Innocence, and &s;hield him|&s;elf from the Edge of the Law, in a &s;trange Country. I told him, That if the Count was really innocent, the Law would natural|ly acquit him, as much tho' a Foreigner as if he was a Native; but that he ought to be cau|tious how he made any Offers to pervert&punc;Ju|&s;tice; for that it were to make all Men of Ho|nour his Enemies, in&s;tead of gaining them to be his Friends. This was one of the fir&s;t Bribes of Value ever offered to me, which I might have accepted without any Danger of Di&s;co|very, and without doing much for it: But my Opinion has always been that what is &s;o acquired is no Addition to our Store, but rather the Cau&s;e of its Wa&s;te, according to the Saying, <HI>Male parta male delabuntur;</HI> I therefore rejected this now as I had done o|thers before, and as I hope I &s;hall always do for the time to come.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t be by all confe&s;&s;ed that his Grace in this acted a very imprudent Part, for he mu&s;t needs have known that his thus que|&s;tioning a Privy Councellor concerning Ad|vice given by him at the Board, would &s;ound

 very har&s;h to the King: And on the other Hand, if his Intentions were really for a Quarrel, he might have cho&s;en a more pro|per Place, and have &s;aid more, or nothing at all.

<P>Two Days afterwards, I went to &s;ee Lord <HI>Danby</HI> in the Tower, and found him to expre&s;s him&s;elf much more obligingly towards Lord Privy Seal, than he had been u&s;ed to do here|tofore; among other Things, he &s;aid his Lord|&s;hip
<PB N="159" REF="162">
had taken a prudent and becoming  Cour&s;e in declaring him&s;elf for a Parliament, and that he was very glad of it upon a pri|vate Account; for that he de&s;paired of be|ing enlarged till there was a Sitting. He &s;aid, Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and his Party might &s;upport them&s;elves for a while, but that the Intere&s;t they built upon was no better than a &s;andy Foundation.</P>
<P>The next Day I communicated this to Lord <HI>Hallifax,</HI> who on his Part &s;eemed al|&s;o to be more favourably inclined towards Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> than he had for &s;ome time been: He &s;aid he had already Enemies enough, and that what he had to &s;ay a|gain&s;t that Lord was now out of his Mind; but that however he would not now make him&s;elf Enemies by being his Friend, as he had formerly done by being otherwi&s;e; &s;o that I found Lord Privy Seal was making up his Intere&s;t on the one hand, as Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was on the other, for the latter had &s;ent for <HI>Seymour</HI> to Court, and pro|mi&s;ed to be his Friend. Lord Privy Seal told me that <HI>Seymour</HI> had made &s;ome Ad|vances to clo&s;e with him, and that a general Reconciliation was endeavouring on the part of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>'s Friends. I told his Lord&s;hip, That, in my poor Opinion, he had much
<PB N="160" REF="163">
 better &s;tand by him&s;elf, now that he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the Intere&s;t of the Na|tion, by the Means of what he had done in Oppo&s;ition to Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> that if he clo&s;ed in with that Side again, he might run the Hazard of lo&s;ing the good Opinion of his Country, which he now &s;o de&s;ervedly enjoyed, whereas if he kept him&s;elf &s;epa|rate, he might be Ma&s;ter of both the one and the other; and that &s;et the Ca&s;e he &s;hould fall, the King would &s;oon be &s;en&s;i|ble of &s;uch a want of him, that he could not long be &s;pared from Court. To this his Lord&s;hip replyed, It would be matter of great Difficulty for him to &s;tay there with Men, who&s;e Intere&s;t it was to remove him. That they would be apt to play him Tricks, knowing that while he was in any Play, their Carriage and Conduct would be no Secrets to his Maje&s;ty; but that if they did engro&s;s the King all to them&s;elves they would not long keep their Hold; for that the King had one Quality which would al|ways pre&s;erve him from being long in ill Hands, meaning his facility to hear all Per|&s;ons, and to admit of all Informations from a Back-door, while the Favourites did not in the lea&s;t dream of &s;uch his Atttention. His Lord&s;hip then lamented the prodigious
<PB N="161" REF="164">
Influence the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> had o|ver  the King, complaining that &s;he betray|ed him not in his Councils only, but his Bed al&s;o, and that &s;he certainly lay with the Grand Prior of <HI>France,</HI> who often came over, under the Mask of Love, the better and more effectually to tran&s;mit Intelligence and Information to his Ma&s;ter the <HI>French</HI> King. He urged it That the King was too pa&s;&s;ive with regard to the&s;e Things, and ob&s;erved it as his greate&s;t Fault, That no Argument could prevail on him to re&s;ent what he clear|ly &s;aw he ought to re&s;ent, and that he de|&s;cended too low &s;rom the &s;ublime Elevation of his Dignity. His Lord&s;hip then took Notice, that I al&s;o, in my Station was the Subject of much Envy, and advi&s;ed me, when I returned again into the Country, to demean my &s;elf &s;o as to gain as great a Mea|&s;ure of Favor and Benevolence as I decent|ly could.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I perceived that the Lord Privy Seal had the better and more approved Cau&s;e, and that the Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> had the more potent and overuling Intere&s;t; that the Lord Privy Seal de&s;ervedly weigh|ed with the Body of the Nation, and that the Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> weighed, tho' unde&s;erv|edly enough, only with the Duke of <HI>York,</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="165">

<P><MILESTONE N="1683" UNIT="date"> I now returned to <HI>York,</HI> and heard that <MILESTONE N="April."

The Duche&s;s took this very kindly, and upon receiving the Patent for that Office, which the City pre&s;ented to the young Duke in a Gold Box, her Grace &s;ent my Lord Mayor a Letter of Thanks, wherein &s;he &s;aid the King was ve|ry well plea&s;ed that the &s;econd City in <HI>Eng|land</HI> had had that Regard for her Son, and a&s;&s;ured him and the Corporation of her ut|mo&s;t

<P><MILESTONE N="June 26." UNIT="date"> In <HI>June</HI> following, we were alarmed with a Report of a dangerous Con&s;piracy again&s;t the King, of &s;uch as had been di&s;appointed of Preferments at Court, and of Prote&s;tant Di&s;|&s;enters. The &s;ame Con&s;piracy was al&s;o again&s;t the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and the De&s;ign was to have &s;hot both his Maje&s;ty and his Highne&s;s as they came from <HI>Newmarket,</HI> the Day of their Return being fixed. This was to have been ex|ecuted by forty Men, who, the Blow given, were to have &s;coured to <HI>London,</HI> and to have reported it to have been done by the Papi&s;ts. In <HI>London</HI> it was &s;aid there were a Body of Men ready to ri&s;e, and to take immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the City and Tower, and con&s;e|quently of the whole Nation, and that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was ready to head the In|&s;urrection.</P>
<P>This was miraculou&s;ly defeated by a fire which burned down a great Part of the
<PB N="164" REF="167">
 Town of <HI>Newmarket,</HI> and cau&s;ed the King's Departure from thence ten Days &s;ooner than was at fir&s;t intended. The De&s;ign thus fru|&s;trated, it was afterward renewed to kill the two Royal Brothers as they came from <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> but the King being alone they po&s;tponed it, their View being to de|&s;troy both or neither. The&s;e and the like Di&s;appointments put it into the Head of one of the melancholy Con&s;pirators, That God to u&s;e his own Phra&s;e, was again&s;t them, which wrought on him to di&s;clo&s;e the whole Affair, and he accordingly did. Upon this, many of the Con&s;pirators, and Abettors withdrew; the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> fled, Lord <HI>Grey</HI> made his E&s;cape after he had been taken, but Sir <HI>Thomas Arm&s;trong</HI> was apprehended and committed to the Tower, together with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> of <HI>Eskrick,</HI> Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> and many others; and Orders were &s;ent down, to us in the North, to keep a watchful Eye, and a ready Hand over all &s;u&s;picious Per&s;ons, and particularly to look out for one Mr. <HI>Goodenough,</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Nelthorp,</HI> who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have made their way towards us. By &s;ome Scotchmen we intercepted and examined, we under&s;tood this Con&s;piracy to have been general with the Fanatics and

Di&s;contented in both Kingdoms, and that  the Corre&s;pondence was carried on, between them, by the <HI>Scotch</HI> Pedlars, and other E|mi&s;&s;aries in di&s;gui&s;e, which cau&s;ed great Scru|tiny and Search to be made and ob&s;erved with Regard to all &s;uch People from the North: But to dwell on the Particulars of this Plot, and the Proofs made, out again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;uffered for it, were needle&s;s, af|ter what has been &s;aid and recorded by ma|ny both privately and publickly concern|ing it; &s;o I &s;hall only &s;ay, that in the Con|clu&s;ion it proved fatal to Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> the elde&s;t Son and Heir to the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and others of more inferior Note.</P>

 the Emperor's General, and partly by the Electors of <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Bavaria:</HI> But the bare mention of this being as much as can be re|quired at my Hands, I &s;hall return to the Po&s;ture and Current of our own Affairs.</P>
<P>In <HI>October,</HI> I had a Letter from my Lord <HI>Hallifax,</HI> to acquaint me that I had the King's Leave to come to Town, which I had de|&s;ired, as thinking it to be nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould be near the King's Per&s;on, at a Time when I thought he would be taking of new Mea|&s;ures and making of new Regulations, with Regard to Affairs in general, and Officersin particular, for his own and the Nation's greater Security after the late horrid Ma|chinations: accordingly I &s;at out the latter End of this Month for <HI>London,</HI> where I ar|rived in <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>I went to vi&s;it my Lord Privy Seal, and found him &s;till rooted in the King's good E&s;teem; but that the Duke was not altoge|ther &s;o grateful to him as he ought to have been. I found al&s;o that the Differences be|tween his Lord&s;hip and Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> not only &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;till, but with more Acrimony and Warmth than before; and under&s;tood that the Lord Mayor of <HI>York</HI> was &s;ent for up, by an Order of Council, on account of &s;ome Words he had &s;poken. The King re|ceived
<PB N="167" REF="170">
me very graciou&s;ly, and the Duke  &s;eemed kind to me, nor did my Lord <HI>Ro|che&s;ter,</HI> whom I vi&s;ited, &s;cruple to favour me with a decent Reception.</P>
<P>But I found the Hopes of a Parliament to be &s;till at a very great Di&s;tance, tho' <HI>Flanders</HI> was in Danger of falling next Spring under the Yoke of <HI>France,</HI> and tho' the Na|tion was much di&s;&s;atisfied at the tedious De|lay, that Part of the Nation, I mean, that was in Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t. And ju&s;t now it hapned that the Grand Pri|or of <HI>France</HI> being in <HI>England,</HI> and ob&s;erved to be very fond of the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and &s;he of him, the King conceived &s;o great a Jealou&s;y thereat he &s;ent him away; and it was &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected the Duche&s;s would not be long behind him, which few People &s;eemed to be very &s;orry for.</P>
<P>I had heard, from a great Man, that &s;omething would &s;hortly happen very much to the Mortification of the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and his Party, a My&s;tery which &s;eemed in a few Days afterwards to be explained. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> being &s;u&s;pected to have taken Refuge &s;omewhere abroad, on account of the Con&s;piracy, &s;urrenders him&s;elf to Mr. Secre|tary <HI>Jenkins,</HI> at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> where the Thing being before concerted, the King and Duke
<PB N="168" REF="171">
 went to him, and, after an Hour's Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uffered him to go to his Lodgings at the Cockpit, attended by his own Servants, and under no other Re&s;traint than that of a Ser|jeant at Arms; but what was &s;aid or done at this Interview, may be conjectured &s;ooner than known.</P>
<P>This was matter of Surpri&s;e to all People, and waiting on Lord Privy Seal, he told me, He doubted not but the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>'s Affair, his Grace having that Day ki&s;&s;ed the King's Hand, the Duke's and the Queen's, would be the Subject of great Spe|culation, and that various Gue&s;&s;es would be made as to the Interce&s;&s;ion that brought it to pa&s;s. I told him the World &s;aid the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> had done it, and that it was publickly known That the King had the Day before in Coun|cil &s;aid, It was at the Reque&s;t of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> to whom his Grace had made Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, and di&s;claimed all Competition with for the Crown. His Lord&s;hip an&s;wered, that the Thing was far from &s;o, for that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> and tho&s;e in his Intere&s;t, had oppo&s;ed it to the very la&s;t; and thereupon owned him&s;elf to have been chiefly in&s;tru|mental therein; and gave me &s;everal Rea|&s;ons both public and private, tho' not pro|per
<PB N="169" REF="172">
to be here enumerated, why he labour|ed  to that End. By this it plainly appear|ed to me, That notwith&s;tanding the extra|ordinary Strength of the Intere&s;t combined again&s;t him, this noble Lord had great Power with his Maje&s;ty. His Lord&s;hip moreover gave me to under&s;tand that his Grace had made Confe&s;&s;ion of the late Plot, but would not give any public Evidence a|gain&s;t the Con&s;pirators. But to di&s;mi&s;s this, certain it is that whoever wrought &s;o indu|&s;triou&s;ly, with the King, in favour of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf may be &s;aid to have had a large Share therein. He had a paternal Affection for him, nor could refrain from the mo&s;t open and pub|lic Expre&s;&s;ions of it wherever he &s;aw him; and the Duke on his Part paid all the Re|&s;pect and Duty imaginable in attending up|on, and following the King. Mean while, <MILESTONE N="Aug. 28."

UNIT="date"> next Day Mr. <HI>Algernon Sydney</HI> was executed upon Tower Hill, as one of the Con&s;pirators, but &s;aid nothing before he &s;uffered. He only left a Paper with the Sheriff, which I heard the King &s;ay was very trea&s;onable and eva|&s;ive, tho' not wholly negative of the Fact laid to his Charge; but, however, it was not thought proper to be printed. And now I found that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was not at all plea&s;ed with the Lord Privy Seal, tho' he made open &s;hew of the contrary, for that he was not con&s;ulted on the Re&s;toration of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> and it was his Lord|&s;hip's own Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>That the Duke would never forgive it him.</HI> But the King having been the chief Promoter of it, it did not ap|pear that his Lord&s;hip had lo&s;t any Ground with him. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> would not perform what was expected of him, and how could his Lord&s;hip help it?</P>
<P>The Confederates, <HI>Spain, Holland, Swe|den,</HI> and the re&s;t, who were now preparing to re&s;i&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and to pre&s;erve <HI>Flanders,</HI> were very angry with us, for that we &s;till &s;upinely per&s;i&s;ted in our Neutrality, and particularly the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who &s;aid it was a Breach of our League with him; but all Re|mon&s;trances
<PB N="173" REF="176">
of this Sort were to none ef|fect;  our King pretended his own Affairs were in &s;o ill a Po&s;ture at Home, that he could not &s;o much as think of involving him|&s;elf in a War; which confirmed the Jealou|&s;y of our adhering to the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, and of a private Commerce kept up with them, by the intervention of the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and others.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Dec. 11." UNIT="date"> The Talk of the Town now was, That the Lord Privy Seal was not well with the King, and that at Court he met with Di&s;|couragements of &s;uch a Nature, as to make him retire from Bu&s;ine&s;s. I communicated this to his Lord&s;hip, who told me, He had, indeed, met with Di&s;couragements from &s;ome, but none at all from the King, for that he was as well there as ever; and that there would be a farther Production of Af|fairs in a little time than was expected, and &s;o pointed at the Thing that I ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed what he meant. A few Days afterwards I was with the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> who told me he was &s;orry to find That Lord Privy Seal, purely to out do his Antagoni&s;t <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> &s;hould have had &s;o great a Hand in bringing in <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and thereby have incurred the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Di&s;plea&s;ure, as well as the Di&s;like of a great Number of the Loyali&s;ts,
<PB N="174" REF="177">
 who were before his Friends. That, not many Hours before, the Duke had told him, That if the Lord Privy Seal had had no Friend&s;hip for him in any other Capacity, yet as being the King's Brother, he might have let him into the Secret, and not have brought in <HI>Monmouth</HI> quite without his Pri|vity: That indeed he never could forget what the Lord Privy Seal had formerly done to &s;erve him; but that he took a Way, if po&s;&s;ible, to make him forget it; and that to his Knowledge, his Lord&s;hip was &s;till ex|erting his Labours to reunite the King and <HI>Monmouth.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI> then ob|&s;erved, That his Highne&s;s knew his Relati|on to the Lord Privy Seal, but that the Loy|alty and Re&s;pect he bore to his Highne&s;s was more con&s;idered by him than all that, and that he hoped his Lord&s;hip de&s;igned him no Di&s;&s;ervice in this Affair, with much more to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; in &s;hort, his Grace &s;eemed much to lament what his Lord&s;hip had done in Favor of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> His Grace added, That if the Privy Seal would but tru&s;t him, he would tell him how to be too hard for <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> without recurring to &s;uch unpopular Methods.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Jan. 2." UNIT="date"> I communicated the Particulars of this Conver&s;ation to his Lord&s;hip, who an&s;wer|ed,
<PB N="175" REF="178">
That he thereby perceived the Duke had  a Mind to be upon better Mea&s;ures with him; but that, ab&s;olutely, he had not &s;een the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;ince he la&s;t left the Court; that as to what he had done for his Grace, it was purely in Obedience to the King's Commands; and that as the King would not allow him, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to have di&s;clo&s;ed the Matter to his Highne&s;s; and concluded, that he was to dine with the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> the <HI>Wed|ne&s;day</HI> following, and &s;hould the better know what to &s;ay to his Grace, if he touched up|on this Affair, &s;ince I had taken Care to apprize him of his Thoughts.</P>
<P>I learnt from a great Man, that we were in no Way of having a Parliament, there be|ing &s;ome near the King, who advi&s;ed him to another Way of ruling the Kingdom. The &s;ame Gentleman, at the &s;ame time, la|mented, That now the Fanatics had nothing el&s;e to &s;ay again&s;t the Government, they mu&s;t have &s;ufficient Cau&s;e of Complaint up|on this Account, as well as on Account of &s;everal other Points now in Agitation. Some Days afterwards, my Lord Privy Seal told me, He had been very earne&s;t with the King to call a Parliament, and had repre&s;ented to him, That tho' he had &s;lipped the Opportu|nity
<PB N="176" REF="179">
 of calling one immediately after the late Plot, when he could not po&s;&s;ibly have failed of one according to his Mind, and might fear he &s;hould meet with no good one now, he would do well to con&s;ider, that the long|er he deferred the Thing, the wor&s;e it would be, and indeed &s;o very bad, That it might be u&s;ed as an Argument never to call one more. That nothing ought to have that Weight with him, as his Word given to the People; that the Law required a Parliament to be called every three Year; and that, up|on the la&s;t Di&s;&s;olution, his Maje&s;ty had pro|mi&s;ed a religious Ob&s;ervance of the Laws, by a Proclamation &s;etting forth his Rea&s;ons for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing that Parliament: That the ge|neral Con&s;truction put upon this was, that he intended to call another within the three Years, and that he feared an ill U&s;e might be made of his not doing what it was &s;o ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed he certainly would: That tho' the Antimonarchi&s;ts were now at a ve|ry low Ebb, and under great Di&s;courage|ments, &s;uch his Maje&s;ty's procedure might rai&s;e a Spirit of Di&s;content where it was lea&s;t expected, meaning among tho&s;e, who tho' they were Friends to the Crown, were, at the &s;ame time, de&s;irous he &s;hould govern according to Law, and not only de&s;ired, but
<PB N="177" REF="180">
expected it, &s;ince he had given his Royal  Word, that he would do &s;o: That if, how|ever, his Maje&s;ty thought not well of this, he would be neverthele&s;s &s;o far from relin|qui&s;hing his Service, that he would make it his Study to find out Excu&s;es to make him ea&s;y with the People. So then there was no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eeing a Parliament a&s;&s;embled, but by &s;ome Compul&s;ion from a foreign Cau&s;e, and no Body could tell, but that if the War went on, the Confederates might be pro|voked to declare again&s;t us.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Affairs were now chiefly under the Management of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who carried every Thing with a very lofty hand; but, what is very &s;trange, the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> was on the Point of &s;tepping out of the Tower, tho' again&s;t his Highne&s;s's Con&s;ent. My Lord Privy Seal a&s;&s;ured me his Enlargement was at hand; that he him&s;elf had been his Lord&s;hip's chief Friend, and that the King had made both the Duke and Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;eeming|ly &s;et their Hands to it. The Duke, in|deed, appeared to be hearty in it, and that the King was &s;o, there could be no doubt; but <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Sunderland</HI> did underhand oppo&s;e it with might and main, and &s;o con|trived that the Judges delayed to bail out his Lord&s;hip 'till the very la&s;t Day of the Term; tho&s;e two Lords dreading, That
<PB N="178" REF="181" MS="y">
 <HI>Danby</HI> might join with <HI>Hallifax</HI> to weaken <MILESTONE N="Feb. 10." UNIT="date"> their Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>And now it was re&s;olved to bring a <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> if with any Colour of Ju&s;tice it could be done, again&s;t the Charter of <HI>York;</HI> and two Days afterwards, Lord <HI>Danby</HI> was bailed out of his long Confinement of five Years, as were all the Popi&s;h Lords that had been under Durance ever &s;ince the Time of the fir&s;t Plot. Lord <HI>Danby</HI> came the &s;ame Day to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ty's Hand in the Bed|chamber, where I hapned to be pre&s;ent. The King received him very kindly, and when the Earl complained of his long Im|pri&s;onment, his Maje&s;ty told him, he knew it was again&s;t his Con&s;ent, which his Lord|&s;hip thankfully acknowledged; but they had no Manner of private Di&s;cour&s;e together. My Lord Privy Seal came into the Pre&s;ence pre&s;ently after, and the two Lords &s;aluted each other; but it was very &s;lightly done on both Sides, The next Day, however, I went from the Lord Privy Seal, to wait upon the Earl, when his Lord&s;hip de&s;ired me to pre&s;ent his Service to him, and to tell him, That he &s;hould have taken a more particular Sort of Notice of him, but that he thought it would not prove &s;o much for his Service: And the Earl &s;aid, It was for the very &s;elf &s;ame Rea&s;on he had behaved
<PB N="179" REF="182" MS="y">
&s;o indifferently towards his Lord&s;hip; for  there was at that Time great Jealou&s;y of a Friend&s;hip between them. Lord <HI>Danby</HI> told me, he would retire to his Hou&s;e out of Town, nor concern him&s;elf with Bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' he doubted not but he might if he would, but not upon the national Foundati|on he de&s;ired, and therefore would have no|thing to do with it, declaring his Aver&s;ion to a <HI>French</HI> or a Popi&s;h Intere&s;t. He told me al&s;o, the Sub&s;tance of what had pa&s;&s;ed between the Duke and him, at the Vi&s;it he made to his Highne&s;s, after he had been with the King, and I thereby under&s;tood his Lord&s;hip was upon no very affectionate Terms with that Prince. He &s;aid his High|ne&s;s told him, he had heard he had &s;poken &s;lightingly of him, and that he an&s;wered, It was true he had often been &s;o unfortunate as to differ with him in Opinion, and could not help &s;aying, That he had never yet found any Cau&s;e to repent him of it; but that for expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf any how again&s;t his Per&s;on, if he heard &s;o, they were Whi&s;|pers and Lies; and de&s;ired to know who were his Informers; but the Duke evaded that. In &s;hort, I found by my Lord Privy Seal, That he and the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> had a good Under&s;tanding together.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="183" MS="y">
 The King went to <HI>Newmarket,</HI> and I fol|lowed <MILESTONE N="March 1."

The Manner of the King's dividing his Time at this Place was thus: He walked in the Morning 'till ten of the Clock; then he went to the Cockpit 'till Dinner-time; about three he went to the Hor&s;e-races; at &s;ix he returned to the Cockpit, for an Hour only; then he went to the Play, tho' the Actors were but of a terrible Sort; from thence to Supper; then to the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>'s 'till Bed-time; and &s;o to his own Apartment to take his Re&s;t.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="May 25."

<P>I returned to the North, and the <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following, we had the grateful News that <HI>Buda</HI> had been taken for the Emperor, by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> as al&s;o, that a Truce was made between the Emperor and the King of <HI>France,</HI> which looked as if a gene|ral Peace was at Hand, that the Chri&s;tian Powers might the better exert them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the pre&s;umptuous Arms of the Infidel.

<PB N="185" REF="188">
Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> had been removed from the  Head of the Trea&s;ury Board, to that of the Council; in which, tho' he was advanced in Honour, he was put backward in Profit and Power: It was therefore mo&s;t evident|ly what he never &s;ought for, and as plain, that Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> had brought it to pa&s;s: Thus it was that Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> now in the Country, conjectured; and it was &s;oon con|firmed to me, by a Letter from my Lord <HI>Marqui&s;s</HI> him&s;elf, wherein he made U&s;e of the&s;e Words; <HI>You may believe I am not at all di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch an Adver&s;ary removed from the only Place that could give him Power and Advantage; and he bears it with &s;o little Phi|lo&s;ophy, that, if I had ill Nature enough, he gives me &s;ufficient Occa&s;ion to triumph.

But what &s;erved in very great Mea&s;ure to quiet the Minds and allay the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men, was King <HI>James</HI>'s Decla|ration to the Privy Council immediately af|ter the Breath was out of his Brother's Body, Whereby he promi&s;ed to defend the Government of <HI>England,</HI> both in Church and State, and carefully to tread in the Foot|&s;teps of his late Maje&s;ty, with regard to his Kindne&s;s and Lenity towards his People; and that as on the one Hand, he would de|fend the ju&s;t Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, &s;o on the other, he would invade no Man's Property.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed at <HI>York</HI> a few Days to keep the Peace, and, in the mean time, had Notice
<PB N="190" REF="193">
 from the proper Hands, that I was continu|ed in my Command, and that I had leave to &s;et out for <HI>London,</HI> as I, indeed had de|&s;ired. <MILESTONE N="Feb. 16." UNIT="date"> But now there began to be great Changes at Court; Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was made Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>England;</HI> Lord Privy Seal was made Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council; which tho' it was a Step higher as to Place, it was much doubted that it was not at his Lord&s;hip's De&s;ire; the Tru&s;t and Profit of the Privy Seal being judged to be an overbalance for the Honour of the other. And now we had the agreeable Pro&s;pect of of a Parliament, which it was &s;aid his Ma|je&s;ty intended &s;hould meet in <HI>May</HI> next.</P>
<P>It was now beyond all Doubt that the <MILESTONE N="April 13."

<PB N="191" REF="194" MS="y">
Endeavours to &s;erve the King, and that he  would continue to do the &s;ame; but that he hoped his Maje&s;ty would not think of im|po&s;ing his Religion on him; which he &s;eem|ed &s;orrowfully to apprehend, the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Po&s;ts in the Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI> being now put into the Hands of Papi&s;ts. His Lord&s;hip then recalled to me &s;everal In&s;tan|ces of the late King's Kindne&s;s to him, and certainly no Man was deeper in his Favour, when his Maje&s;ty was unfortunately &s;natch|ed away, than my Lord Marqui&s;s. A few <MILESTONE N="April 22." UNIT="date"> Days afterwards, I waited on his Maje&s;ty, ki&s;&s;ed his Hand, and at the &s;ame time pre|&s;ented him with an Addre&s;s from the young Men of the City of <HI>York,</HI> who had petition|ed me for leave to exerci&s;e them&s;elves at Arms on certain Days of the Year, which the King received very kindly.</P>
<P>The next Day my Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> told me he had had two private Audiences of the King, and that he had in &s;uch plain Terms told him his Mind, upon the grand Point of Government, that he much wondered the King, con&s;idering his natural Temper, took it with that Calmne&s;s and Compo&s;ure he did. His Lord&s;hip then ob&s;erved, It po&s;&s;ibly might be in&s;i&s;ted on, that &s;ome Acts &s;hould, in the en&s;uing Parliament, be repealed, which
<PB N="192" REF="195" MS="y">
 would require a weighty and mature Deli|beration; and touched on &s;ome Things not altogether &s;o fit to be in&s;erted in this Place.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="April 23." UNIT="date"> The King was crowned and the Queen in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> with all imaginable Pomp and magnificence, except that there was no Cavalcade thorough the City, as the Cu&s;tom had formerly been.</P>
<P>Their Maje&s;ties went privately to the Pa|lace at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> where they, the Nobili|ty, and all the Officers of the Crown put on their Robes, Formalities, and En&s;igns, and thence proceeded thorough <HI>Palace-yard,</HI> rail|ed in and prepared for that Purpo&s;e, in Pro|ce&s;&s;ion to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> whence the Ce|remony being compleated, they all returned to the Hall, to a mo&s;t &s;umptuous Dinner. And now the Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons began to con&s;ider what the Court might demand of them, as well as what might be granted at the approaching Se&s;&s;i|on, the Parliament con&s;i&s;ting of a great Number of Loyal Gentlemen, who were neverthele&s;s, good Patriots, and true Pro|te&s;tants. The Report went, that there would be more required in Behalf of Pope|ry, than the Laws now in Force would al|low of; and that the King expected the Settlement of a con&s;tant Revenue upon him,
<PB N="193" REF="196" MS="y">
&s;uitable to that of the late King, be&s;ides a  Sum of ready Money to &s;ubvene his pre&s;eut Occa&s;ions. That in favour of Popery it would be propo&s;ed to repeal the <HI>Habeas Cor|pus</HI> Act, which I found was much oppo&s;ed by &s;ome great ones, in their private Di&s;|cour&s;e, as well as by &s;ome of us; and to en|act a general Toleration or Liberty of Con|&s;cience, which &s;ome &s;eemed willing enough to &s;ub&s;cribe to; tho' at the &s;ame time, the Re&s;olution was to admit of no Alteration to capacitate Papi&s;ts to enjoy any Place or Im|ployment in or under the Government. As for the Affair of Money, Men in general &s;eemed willing to &s;ettle an hand&s;ome Reve|nue upon the King, and to give him Mo|ney, but whether their Grant &s;hould be per|manent or only temporary, and to be renew|ed from time to time by Parliament, that the Nation might be the oftner con&s;ulted, was the Que&s;tion: In all this, I re&s;olved punctually to do my Duty to the Crown, but not to be unmindful of a due Regard for my Country, and my Religion.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="May 4." UNIT="date"> I had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with Mr. <HI>Hilliard,</HI> Sir <HI>Roger Martin,</HI> and other, Gentlemen of great Con&s;ideration with the Popi&s;h Party: They told me, The King would expect a Repeal of the Sanguinary Laws; that the

That the King would never divide the regal Power by admitting of that of the Pope; that his Maje&s;ty was too fond of Power to be guilty of that Over&s;ight; and that his adhering to the Defence of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> would on the other Hand, deter the Pope from pre&s;&s;ing him to admit of his Supremacy; in &s;hort, That it was but rea&s;onable the King &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on the Repeal of the &s;everer penal Laws a|gain&s;t the Papi&s;ts; for that if he &s;hould die, he would leave them in as ill a plight as he found them: But what Wi&s;dom or Sen&s;e there was in tho&s;e who, at this time, could offer at &s;uch Arguments, need not be &s;aid.</P>
<P>I waited on the King in his Barge from <HI>Whitehall</HI> to <HI>Somer&s;et-hou&s;e,</HI> where he went to vi&s;it the Queen Dowager: It was upon this Day, that the noted Doctor <HI>Oates</HI> was convi|cted of Perjury, it being proved, that he was at

The King then &s;ubjoined, That <HI>Oates</HI> being thus convicted, the Popi&s;h Plot was now dead; to which I an&s;wering, That it had been long &s;ince dead, and that now it would be buried; his Maje&s;ty &s;o well ap|proved of the Turn, that going with him afterwards to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s, I heard him repeat it to her.</P>
<P>Three or four Days afterwards, we had Advice, That a Store of Arms had been bought up in <HI>Holland,</HI> and conveyed into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that Lord <HI>Argyle,</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> and &s;ome &s;aid the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> were actually gone with them, or after them.</P>

He de&s;ired of us &s;uitable Returns in &s;ettling the Revenue on him for Life, as in the Days of the late King; and conclud|ed with an Account he had received from <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> was landed with Men and Arms, on the We&s;tern I&s;lands of that Kingdom; and that the &s;aid Lord had publi&s;hed two Declarations, in both of which he charged him with Tyranny and U&s;urpation.</P>

And now all Things &s;eemed to &s;mile with a very au&s;picious Countenance, the King forbearing the lea&s;t Advances to|wards a Change of Religion, and &s;eeming to be bent quite the contrary Way.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="June 23." UNIT="date"> The next Day the King had Notice, that <HI>Monmouth</HI> had &s;ent a Letter to the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> under the Stile and Title of his mo&s;t tru&s;ty and well-beloved Cou&s;in and Councellor, <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> charging him upon his Allegiance to come into his Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance; in a Word, That he now took upon him to be King; that he was marched from <HI>Taunton</HI> towards <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> with about 5000 Men and Boys, and that <HI>Albemarle</HI> was at his Heels.</P>
<P>The next Day I hapned to dine with Sir <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="date"> <HI>James Smith,</HI> the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> whom I had formerly known intimately well, and who was of a very Loyal Club in the City, where I u&s;ed to go, while the Fanatic Plot was in agitation. This Gen|tleman complained to me, That he enjoyed no more than the bare Title of Lord Mayor, the Lord chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Jefferies</HI> u&s;urping the Power; that the City had no Sort of Inter|cour&s;e with the King, but by the Intervention of that Lord; that whatever was well done in the City, was attributed to his Influence and Management; and that him&s;elf and the Aldermen were by the Court looked upon no better than his Tools: That upon all Oc|ca&s;ions
<PB N="208" REF="211" MS="y">
 his Lord&s;hip was &s;o forgetful of the high Dignity of the City as to u&s;e him and his Brethren with Contempt; in fine, that the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice was to be pitied; that his Haughtine&s;s would be the ruin of him; and that he actually intended to let the King into the My&s;tery of the&s;e Things; but that he thought the pre&s;ent Time was not altogether &s;o proper, &s;eeing a Remon|&s;trance of this Tendency might be con&s;trued into Mutiny and Di&s;affection. I an&s;wered, That the King was too well acquainted with the Lord Mayor's Services and Integrity to &s;u&s;pect him of that, and that, in my Opini|on, now was the fitte&s;t Time for expo&s;ing a Man in that Credit at Court; for that now the greate&s;t Notice would be taken of all &s;uch Grievances. Indeed I was &s;orry at my Heart to &s;ee &s;uch good Men di&s;&s;atisfied in any Degree; but I was as glad to find this proud Man &s;een through; for he had to my Knowledge u&s;ed the City of <HI>York</HI> as &s;curvi|ly as it was po&s;&s;ible for him to u&s;e the City of <HI>London.</HI> For at <HI>York</HI> he put out five Aldermen tho' he had &s;olemnly engaged to keep them in, and that, without &s;o much as allowing them to be heard as to the Crimes they &s;tood accu&s;ed of. The Lord Mayor &s;aid the very fame had been frequently pra|cti&s;ed
<PB N="209" REF="212" MS="y">
in <HI>London,</HI> and that many had been  turned out of their Employments without &s;o much as being &s;uffered to make their De|fence. In &s;hort, I was at the very &s;ame Time told by one of the Lieutenancy of the City, That &s;hould the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> give a Blow to the King's Forces, it was much to be feared there would be an In&s;ur|rection in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="July. 2." UNIT="date"> This Day, both Hou&s;es attended the King in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and his Maje&s;ty having pa&s;&s;ed five Bills, ordered the Hou&s;e to be adjourned to the 4th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which was done accordingly. And now the Fears of tho&s;e who were Friends to the Govern|ment, added to the Hopes of tho&s;e who were aver&s;e to it. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Army was &s;welled to a Body of 12000 Foot, and 1500 Hor&s;e, which moved from Place to Place, in the hilly and inclo&s;ed Country of the We&s;t, where tho' the King's Army kept pretty clo&s;e in with them; they could not offer to give Battle. The King's Army, that was neare&s;t to <HI>Monmouth,</HI> was command|ed by Lord <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and did not con&s;i&s;t of above 3000 Foot, and five hundred Hor&s;e, but then they were mo&s;tly of the Guards. In a Day or two the King had Advice, that <HI>Monmouth</HI> had got into <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> that he
<PB N="210" REF="213">
 intended to fortify him&s;elf there whil&s;t he refre&s;hed his Army, and that Lord <HI>Fever|&s;ham</HI> was clo&s;e after him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="July 6." UNIT="date"> The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> being then inform|ed, That Lord <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> lay incamped at not above three Miles from <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> that his Army was as yet but &s;mall, that he was in Expectation of being reinforced by three <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and three <HI>Scotch</HI> Regiments from <HI>Holland,</HI> and that a Body of Hor&s;e was on its March from <HI>London</HI> to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; he &s;teals out about one in the Morn|ing, with his whole Army, and moves to|wards the Royal Camp, and that with &s;uch Silence and good Order, That the King's People knew nothing of the Approach 'till alarmed by the Fire of one of their out Sen|tries. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> marched at the Head of the Foot, and Lord <HI>Grey</HI> led up the Hor&s;e, and they brought their Cannon to play within Pi&s;tol-&s;hot. On the other Hand, our People got into Order as fa&s;t, and received them as well as could be ex|pected, but were &s;o overpowered by Num|bers, that 'till Lord <HI>Grey</HI> went off with the Hor&s;e, which were frightned at the Cannon, we were in very imminent Danger of lo&s;ing the Day: But for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> he &s;tood 'till a great Part of his Foot was cut
<PB N="211" REF="214" MS="y">
to Pieces, and then made off; but &s;o nar|rowly  that his Coat, his Papers, and his Se|cretary were taken. <HI>Fergu&s;on,</HI> that Arch|presbyterian Prie&s;t and Rebel, and Lord <HI>Grey</HI> was taken in Di&s;gui&s;e, three Days af|terwards.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had, from the ve|ry Beginning of this de&s;perate Attempt, be|haved with the Conduct of a great Captain, as was allowed even by the King, who, in my Hearing, &s;aid he had not made one fal&s;e Step. And thus was this great Storm, which gathered from a &s;mall Cloud, the Number that landed with the Duke not exceeding 150, thus I &s;ay, was this great Storm for|tunately not to &s;ay &s;urpri&s;ingly allayed. Had <HI>Monmouth</HI> obtained a Victory, it was much to be feared, that the Di&s;affected would have ri&s;en in &s;uch Numbers, in the &s;everal Parts of <HI>England,</HI> as to have made the Crown <MILESTONE N="July 9." UNIT="date"> precarious. But to complete the King's good Fortune, came News, that the Duke him&s;elf had been taken in Di&s;gui&s;e in a Wood, by a Parcel of Country Fellows who were in que&s;t of him, together with one Count <HI>Horn,</HI> who being fir&s;t di&s;covered in a Bu&s;h, told them the Duke him&s;elf was not far off; and the &s;ame Day the Duche&s;s of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and her two Sons were &s;ent to
<PB N="212" REF="215" MS="y">
 the Tower. The Duke, when he was ta|ken, was almo&s;t &s;pent, not having been in a Bed for three Weeks; he was quite un|provided with Arms, nor made any Defence, being de&s;titute of every thing but a Watch he had in his Pocket, and about three hun|dred Pounds in Gold, which was all the Money he had left. His Maje&s;ty, and no wonder, was extremely well plea&s;ed at this News; but he was of a Temper &s;o very e|qual, that he never appeared tran&s;ported upon any Occa&s;ion; and &s;urely he never could have a greater Rea&s;on for it than now, that he &s;aw the Rebellion plucked up by the very Roots, and him&s;elf firmer &s;eated on the Throne, by the Endeavours that had been u&s;ed to &s;hake him out of it.</P>
<P>When his Grace came to Town, the King, at his own Reque&s;t, &s;aw him at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> where he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Dete&s;tation of his Attempt; threw the Blame on the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and <HI>Fergu&s;on,</HI> who had &s;tirred him up to it; di&s;claiming all Title to the Crown, and &s;aid he was put upon a&s;&s;uming the Stile of King, with a View that the Quality would the &s;ooner come in to him; all this I heard the King &s;ay, but what he farther confe&s;&s;ed, was not then known. He concluded with a De&s;ire of Pardon, and, on his Knees,
<PB N="213" REF="216" MS="y">
begged his Life of the King; and for the  &s;ame, he, by Letters, &s;ollicited the two Queens, 'till his Head was at five Blows &s;e|vered from his Body, on <HI>Tower-hill.</HI> When he came to &s;uffer, he &s;ubmitted with great Unconcern, renounced all Pretence to the Crown, and unkindly, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, di&s;|owned his Duche&s;s, who to him, who had nothing of his own, had brought a Fortune of ten thou&s;and Pounds a Year; &s;aying &s;he was given to him as his Wife in the Days of his Minority, but that the Wife of his own Choice, was the Lady <HI>Henrietta Wentworth,</HI> the only Daughter and Heire&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> whom he had debauched; with whom he confe&s;&s;ed he had lived according to the Rules of his own Convenience, tho' not according to the Laws of the Land, for two Years pa&s;t. He then &s;aid he was &s;orry for the Effu&s;ion of Blood he had cau&s;ed, but, throughout his whole Di&s;cour&s;e, made no mention of a Rebellion; and out of his Pocket were taken Books, in his own hand Writing, containing Charms or Spells to o|pen the Doors of a Pri&s;on, to obviate the Danger of being wounded in Battle, toge|ther with Songs and Prayers; &s;uch was the latter End of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI></P>
<P>Towards the Clo&s;e of this Month, I
<PB N="214" REF="217" MS="y">
 returned to my Government, where no|thing occurring of a Nature general enough to be worthy of public Notice, I &s;hall hur|ry on to the End of <HI>October,</HI> when we had the bad News, That my Lord Marqui&s;s of <HI>Hallifax,</HI> Lord Pre&s;ident of the Privy Coun|cil, was fallen into Di&s;grace with the King, and quite di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the Board; he had ever been a true and kind Patron to me; but what was more, he was a Man of great Integrity and mo&s;t happy Talents, which made it feared the Public might feel the want of him as &s;en&s;ible as his Friends; but it being the King's Plea&s;ure, it became all good Subjects to &s;ubmit to it: But two or three Days afterwards, being with the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Gooderick,</HI> they told me, It was true the King had laid a&s;ide the Lord Pre&s;ident, but that he had a&s;&s;igned no Cau&s;e for it, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Jealou|&s;y, That the King would offer at &s;omething this Se&s;&s;ion, in favour of Popery.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Nov. 9." UNIT="date"> And now the Term of the la&s;t Adjourn|ment being elap&s;ed, I repaired to <HI>London;</HI> where I found the Hou&s;e of Commons had deferred the Con&s;ideration of the King's Speech, on the Day of their Meeting, which was the 9th, to the 13th In&s;tant. The Hou&s;e of Lords had voted their Thanks;
<PB N="215" REF="218">
but the Commons being moved to the &s;ame,  made Head again&s;t it, as we have hinted. The King in this Speech told the Hou&s;es He was glad to meet them in better Times than when he parted with them; that the Rebellion was now perfectly qua&s;hed; but that, however, the Government might be in like Manner attempted for the future, it being experienced, that the Militia of the Kingdom was of no U&s;e; that therefore as the &s;tanding Force was but &s;mall, he had rai&s;ed it to a con&s;iderable Number, which would be an additional Charge upon him, for the Time to come; that, in con&s;ideration thereof, he de&s;ired a proportionable Aid: That it was true There were &s;ome popi&s;h Officers in this Army, but that he hoped it would make no Difference between him and his Parliament; for that tho' they were not qualified by Law, they were &s;uch as had &s;hewn their Principles by their Loyalty; and that having had Experience of this, he would not expo&s;e them to Shame by parting with them, or to that Effect; and that, in fine, he would venture his Life for the true Inte|re&s;t of the Nation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Nov. 13." UNIT="date"> The 13th in&s;tant being come, the Com|mons voted a Supply to his Maje&s;ty, for his pre&s;ent Occa&s;ions; but would neither &s;peci|fy
<PB N="216" REF="219" MS="y">
 the <HI>Quantum,</HI> nor the particular U&s;e it was de&s;igned for. Upon this a long Debate aro&s;e, and the Que&s;tion being put, they di|vided, the No's being 250, and the Ay's 125. They afterwards, the &s;ame Day, came to a Divi&s;ion upon the Que&s;tion, Whether that Hou&s;e &s;hould fir&s;t proceed upon the Sup|ply to the King, or upon the &s;econd Para|graph of his Maje&s;ty's Speech, concerning the popi&s;h Officers in the Army; and it was carryed for po&s;tponing the Supply, by one Voice only; in which Divi&s;ion, the King was told That &s;everal of his Servants, and Officers of the Army, that were of the Hou&s;e, were again&s;t him. The next Day I waited on the King to ki&s;s his Hand, and imme|diately <MILESTONE N="Nov. 14." UNIT="date"> he asked me when I came to Town? I told him, the night before: He &s;aid, He was &s;orry I had not been here &s;ooner, for that if I had, he &s;hould not have lo&s;t the Day before, for one &s;ingle Vote, which he &s;aid was hard, and the more &s;o becau&s;e it was owing to his own Officers; which I took to be an oblique Piece of Admonition to me. This &s;ame Day, The &s;econd Part of the King's Speech was taken into Con&s;iderati|on, and the Re&s;ult was, That an Addre&s;s &s;hould be drawn up and pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, to repre&s;ent to him, that the Re|ception
<PB N="217" REF="220">
of Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants into the Army  was quite contrary to Law, and to de&s;ire that they might be removed from their Po&s;ts. A Committee was appointed for this Purpo&s;e, and likewi&s;e to frame a Bill for the indemnifying the &s;aid Officers, in Con&s;idera|tion that they had entered into the Service at a Time of &s;uch imminent Danger. Wait|ing this Day on Lord <HI>Hallifax,</HI> he told me the Particulars of his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion: He &s;aid he might have continued with greater Ad|vanges than ever, if he could but in Con&s;ci|ence have concurred in &s;ome Things which he &s;aw in Embryo; that the King parted with him with &s;eeming Kindne&s;s, but would a&s;&s;ign no Cau&s;e for it, and that he would name no Body into his Place. This Lord being generally e&s;teemed a wi&s;e Man, and an excellent Subject, the Removal of him, e&s;pecially in almo&s;t the Infancy of a Parlia|ment, was Matter of A&s;toni&s;hment to great Numbers, and injected a Fear, That a Change of Councils was in con&s;equence to en&s;ue a Change of Councellors.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Nov. 19." UNIT="date"> Now the Debate, concerning the Aid to be granted to his Maje&s;ty came on. The Motion was at fir&s;t for two hundred thou|&s;and Pounds, and then four hundred thou|&s;and Pounds on the Part of the Country;
<PB N="218" REF="221" MS="y">
 while tho&s;e of the Court in&s;i&s;ted on twelve hundred thou&s;and Pounds, for the Payment of the new rai&s;ed Forces, for a Term of five Years to come. But the Hou&s;e would give no Ear to &s;uch an Application of the Money they might give, le&s;t it &s;hould prove a Foun|dation for the Support of a &s;tanding Army; they rather cho&s;e to give it to the King to do with it as he would; and at length &s;e|ven hundred thou&s;and Pounds was propo&s;ed, and granted. In the Cour&s;e of this Debate, the U&s;efulne&s;s of a &s;tanding Army, e&s;peci|ally 'till the Ferment of the Rebellion was quite &s;ettled, was much in&s;i&s;ted on by the one Side, while the other expo&s;ed the Dan|ger of it, the Infolency of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Soldiery, the ill Example they were of to the Country, and the heavy Burthen of free Quarters: But there was a Compromi&s;&s;ion of all this, by the Hou&s;es declaring its Intention to make the Militia of more U&s;e for the Time to come, and 'till then it was agreed on, as a Thing nece&s;&s;ary, that the Army &s;hould be kept on Foot.</P>
<P>The Addre&s;s again&s;t popi&s;h Officers being prepared, was this Day read, and agreed to; but a Debate aro&s;e, Whether the Concur|rence of the Lords &s;hould be de&s;ired or not: The Courtiers were again&s;t it, that the King
<PB N="219" REF="222">
might have the better Excu&s;e not to comply  with it, and the Country Gentlemen were, for that Rea&s;on, for enforcing it the more; and upon this Occa&s;ion I divided with the Country, but we lo&s;t it by &s;ome forty Voices. The next Day we con&s;idered of the Ways and Means for rai&s;ing the &s;even hundred thou&s;and Pounds we had granted, and the &s;ame Day we went in a Body, with our Addre&s;s to the King, who had appointed that to be the Time for his receiving it: But his An&s;wer was, That he did not expect &s;uch an Addre&s;s from &s;uch a Hou&s;e of Commons e&s;pecially as he had &s;o lately offered to our Con&s;ideration the great Advantages of an Union between him and us, the good Effects of which had been already experienced: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I had, &s;aid he, Rea&s;on to hope the Repu|tation God has ble&s;&s;ed me with in the World, might have created and confirm|ed in you, a greater Confidence of me, and of all I &s;ay to you: But however you, on your Part, proceed, I, on mine, &s;hall be &s;teady to all the Promi&s;es I have made, and be very ju&s;t to my Word given in e|very one of my Speeches;"</Q> this he utter|ed with great Warmth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Nov. 18." UNIT="date"> The Hou&s;e, the next Day, con&s;ulted on the Means to make the Militia of more ef|fectual
<PB N="220" REF="223" MS="y">

At the &s;ame time it was moved by Mr. <HI>Wharton,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Lord <HI>Wharton,</HI> That a Day might be appointed for the Con&s;ideration of the King's An&s;wer to our Addre&s;s; which was &s;econded by Mr. <HI>Cook,</HI> of <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> a Gentleman of three thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> who was &s;o warm as, upon this Oc|ca&s;ion, to &s;ay, <HI>We were all Engli&s;hmen, and that he hoped we &s;hould not be frightned from our Duty, by a few high Words:</HI> But the Hou&s;e re&s;ented this as an Expre&s;&s;ion of great In|decency, and, in great Anger, &s;ending their Member to the Tower, deferred the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s <HI>&s;ine Die.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day, the Lords began to con&s;i|der that Part of his Maje&s;ty's Speech, relat|ing to popi&s;h Officers, and grew very warm in their Debate, which was adjourned to the 23d in&s;tant. The King hapned to be pre|&s;ent, as he was generally con&s;tant in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and was much concerned at the Freedom which they &s;aid was u&s;ed upon this Subject. And, in truth, it gave great Di&s;&s;atisfaction, that the Law in this Point particularly, would be thus invaded and &s;et at nought; and the very be&s;t of the King's Friends, as well as his Officers whe|ther
<PB N="221" REF="224">
Civil or Military, except &s;uch as were  popi&s;hly inclined, were &s;trangely alarmed thereat, and expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with great Freedom whenever it hapned to be the To|pic of their Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Nov. 20." UNIT="date"> In the mid&s;t of this, the King, in the u&s;ual State, comes and, by the Lord Chan|cellor, acquaints both Hou&s;es, That for cer|tain weighty Rea&s;ons, his Maje&s;ty thought fit to prorogue this Parliament untill the 10th of <HI>February</HI> next, and that it was pro|rogued accordingly. This gave Birth to many Conjectures: Some &s;aid the King had &s;o good a Revenue, and was &s;o good a Ma|nager, that he had it in his Power to &s;ub&s;i&s;t both his Fleet and his Army without more Money; and that therefore he would &s;carce have Occa&s;ion for any more Parliaments; that this &s;eemed the more likely as he had, by this Prorogation, refu&s;ed the Sum of &s;e|ven hundred thou&s;and Pounds, which the Commons were preparing to give him: While others believed the King would cer|tainly meet us again, at the Term prefixed, and that, in the mean Time, he would find out &s;ome Expedient to &s;atisfy the Hou&s;es as to the only Article they complained of, meaning the Affair of the popi&s;h Officers; which though it was &s;aid, might be &s;hrewd|ly

<P>To pa&s;s over Lord <HI>Brandon</HI>'s Trial and Condemnation, for the Concern he had had with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> we mu&s;t now ob&s;erve, That the popi&s;h Party behaved with great In&s;olence; which was the more re|marked, as the King of <HI>France</HI> was now in the Height of per&s;ecuting his Prote&s;tant Subjects, who many of them fled as they could, poor and naked; being &s;tripped of all they had. This &s;o great and cruel an In|&s;tance of the Spirit that, for the mo&s;t part, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es tho&s;e of this delu&s;ive Per&s;ua&s;ion, was now the Talk of all thinking People, who began to be of Opinion, that every thing ju&s;t and lawful, ought to be done to obviate the Growth, and abate the pre&s;ent Pride of the Papi&s;ts in our Dominions.

a great Act of Mercy in his Maje&s;ty, this  Lord having been pardoned in the late Reign, for breaking a Boy's Neck, when he was in his Cups, of which being convict|ed, he was condemned as guilty of Mur|ther.</P>
<P>At this Time the favourites at Court, be|gan to be at Strife with each other; the Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> was made Pre&s;ident of the Council, and continued Secretary of State; his Lord&s;hip having artfully in&s;inuated to the Queen (he had then a Mi&s;under&s;tanding with the Trea&s;urer) That the Friends and Relations of the King's fir&s;t Wife, as <HI>Ro|che&s;ter, Clarendon, Dartmouth,</HI> and others, were in greate&s;t Favour, and in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t Places, while her Friends, tho' &s;he was Queen Con&s;ort, were but &s;lenderly pro|vided for; and her Friends being reckoned to be, Lord <HI>Sunderland,</HI> the Lord Chancel|lor, and the Lord <HI>Churchill,</HI> they began to play their private Batteries again&s;t each o|ther.</P>

 her; in which he &s;eemed to act the Part of a wi&s;e Man. But tho' &s;uch is my own private Opinion, I cannot help conti|nuing my Story: One of my Soldiers being upon Guard about eleven in the Night, at the Gate of <HI>Clifford Tower,</HI> the very Night after the Witch was arraigned, he heard a great Noi&s;e at the Ca&s;tle, and going to the Porch, he there &s;aw a Scroll of Paper creep from under the Door, which as he imagin|ed, by Moon&s;hine, turned fir&s;t into the Shape of a Monkey, and thence a&s;&s;umed the Form of a Turky Cock, which pa&s;&s;ed to and fro by him.

This extraordinary Story I had from the Mouth of both the one and the other: And now leave it to be be|lieved or disbelieved as the Reader may be inclined this Way or that.</P>
<P>It is fit we ob&s;erve, That the Way of deal|ing with Men, who propo&s;ed any Bu&s;ine&s;s to them&s;elves in the Government, and e&s;pecially the Members of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, that were in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Places, and near the King, was thus: His Maje&s;ty took them

Elated, &s;eemingly, with this, the King goes on in his old Cour&s;e of di&s;placing Gentlemen that had Po&s;ts, but particularly &s;uch as were of the Parliament, and ob&s;tinate enough to with&s;tand his Wi&s;hes; and now the Parlia|ment

All this Inequality of U&s;age wrought but upon few Prote&s;tants either of E&s;tate or Quality to change their Faith, little or not at all allured by the Baits thrown in their Way, or terrified by the King's Frowns and im|placable Di&s;plea&s;ure: Honour therefore now was the grand Bulwark of our Religion, Gentlemen di&s;daining to have thought they could &s;acrifice the Sweets of Con&s;cience to the mercenary Views of a Reward: In the Mid&s;t of this, dies the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> a Man once of va&s;t E&s;tate, and oftentimes in high Favour with the late King, tho' never with the pre&s;ent; a Man of the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite Wit of his Time, the hand&s;ome&s;t, and be&s;t bred; but unfortunately given up to Plea&s;ures, un&s;teady in his Ways, and, in all Re&s;pects, an Enemy to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>While Addre&s;&s;es of Thanks were every Day pre&s;ented to the King, on the Part of the various Denominarions of Di&s;&s;enters, and from &s;ome even of the Church of <HI>Eng|land;</HI> I had frequent Alarms that the Papi&s;ts were in a Way of per&s;uading the King to

grant them the Mannor of <HI>York,</HI> as a Semi|nary  for the In&s;truction of Youth in the Principles of their Faith; and I this Day heard it was granted accordingly to one <MILESTONE N="June 24."

Surpri&s;ed at this, I wrote to the Lord <HI>Bel|la&s;&s;is,</HI> the principal Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, remon&s;trating, That I had had it by my Commi&s;&s;ion of Governor, grant|ed to my&s;elf by the late King, and confirm|ed by this; that it was worth &s;ixty Pounds a Year to me, and that it had co&s;t me above two hundred Pounds in Repairs, &s;ince I had enjoyed it; and that as I had been allowed nothing for this Expence, I de&s;ired it might be either continued to me, or that his Ma|je&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to grant me &s;uch a Compen&s;ation in lieu thereof, and con&s;ider me in my Disbur&s;ment, in &s;uch Manner and Proportion, as in his great Ju|&s;tice and Wi&s;dom he &s;hould think fit. A few Days afterwards, a Proclamation came to hand, bearing Date the 2d of <HI>July,</HI> where|by the King di&s;&s;olved the Parliament, and at once &s;tunned the main Body of the Nati|on.

<P>In the mid&s;t of the impending Dangers which &s;eemed to threaten us, there was a Nobleman, the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> who had by his Conduct per&s;uaded &s;ome People to think him mad, tho' he certainly acted

upon Principles of great human Prudence.  This Gentleman pa&s;&s;ing thro' <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> in his Way to <HI>London,</HI> I went to pay him a Vi&s;it. He had four Coaches and an hun|dred Hor&s;es in his Retinue, and &s;taid ten Days at a Hou&s;e he borrowed in our Parts. His Cu&s;tom was to dine at &s;ix or &s;even in the Evening, and his Meal always la&s;ted 'till &s;ix or &s;even the next Morning; during which he &s;ometimes drank; &s;ometimes he li&s;tned to Mu&s;ic; &s;ometimes he fell into Di&s;|cour&s;e; &s;ometimes he took Tobacco, and &s;ometimes he ate his Victuals; while the Company had free Choice to &s;it or ri&s;e, to go or come, to &s;leep or not. The Di&s;hes and Bottles were all the Time before them on the Table; and when it was Morning he would hunt or Hawk, if the Weather was fair; if not, he would dance, go to Bed at eleven, and repo&s;e him&s;elf 'till the Evening. Notwith&s;tanding this Irregularity, he was a Man of great Sen&s;e, and though, as I ju&s;t now &s;aid, &s;ome took him to be mad, it is cer|tain his Meaning was to keep him&s;elf out of the Way of more &s;erious Cen&s;ure in the&s;e tickli&s;h Days, and pre&s;erve his E&s;tate, which he took great Care of.</P>

that he de&s;ired a Repeal of the Te&s;t and  penal Laws, for their Ea&s;e and Security, as much as in Behalf of the Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>A &s;trange Look it had, That the very People, who had lately been &s;o indefatiga|bly bu&s;y to dive&s;t him of his Right, and even to deprive him of Life, it having been, in one Parliament, attempted to impeach him of High Trea&s;on, upon the Statute a|gain&s;t a Reconciliation with the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> I &s;ay it looked &s;trange, that the&s;e very Men &s;hould be preferred to tho&s;e who had pre&s;erved him out of their Hands, not in Parliament only, but in the Field al&s;o; but it &s;eems all Con&s;iderations are of no Worth or Validity with a hearty Zeal for the Prie&s;thood of <HI>Rome,</HI> and that Oblivion is &s;o far from being Ingratitude, that it is highly to be commended, a mo&s;t &s;alutary Expedient, when for the Advantage of Mo|ther Church.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="Nov. 5." UNIT="date"> At this Time it was my Turn to feel a Part of the Storm which had hitherto blown over me, or at &s;ome Di&s;tance on each Side from me. I received a Letter from Father <HI>Law&s;on,</HI> the Prie&s;t I formerly mentioned, to give me Notice, That the King having made him a Grant of his Hou&s;e, the Man|nor of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s in <HI>York,</HI> for the Honour of God and the good of his People, he ex|pected from my u&s;ual Civility, that I would give him free and ea&s;y Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. To which I an&s;wered, that I held it by Virtue of a Commi&s;&s;ion that con&s;tituted me Governor of <HI>York;</HI> that he could not think I would dive&s;t my &s;elf of it by my own Act and Deed; that I had too great a Veneration for the King's Bounty, and was too proud of his Service to do that; but that if his Maje&s;ty po&s;itively commanded it, I &s;hould have no|thing to do but to obey; with this Re&s;erve
<PB N="251" REF="254" MS="y">
however, That if his Maje&s;ty gave it away,  I hoped, and in Ju&s;tice it was a Duty in|cumbent on him to endeavour it, I was to have &s;ome Equivalent for the Lo&s;s. Seve|ral Letters pa&s;&s;ed between us, 'till at length the Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> &s;ent me Word, that it was actually granted; while <HI>Law&s;on</HI> flatter|ed me with Expectations that the King would con&s;ider me one way or other, and informed me of &s;everal kind Things his Ma|je&s;ty &s;hould &s;ay of me.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Dec. 7." UNIT="date"> At length Father <HI>Law&s;on</HI> comes in Per|&s;on, and claims Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it being in vain to conte&s;t with him, I ordered my Hou&s;e|keeper to give him Admittance; but he left it again for the pre&s;ent, 'till I could move my Goods. The clear Profits of this Place to me, be&s;ides the U&s;e of the Hou&s;e for my &s;elf and Friends, and Gra&s;s and Hay for my Hor&s;es while I &s;taid in Town, amounted to about forty Pounds a Year. After this, I expected the re&s;t would &s;oon follow; for the King had cau&s;ed or ordered the Lord Lieutenants of mo&s;t, if not all, of the Coun|ties in <HI>England,</HI> to call together their Depu|ties and the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and ask them the&s;e three Que&s;tions, (1.) If in Ca&s;e the King &s;hould call a Parliament, and they &s;hould be cho&s;en Members of it, Whether
<PB N="252" REF="255">
 or no they would Vote to take away the Te&s;t and penal Laws? (2.) Whether or no they would give their Vote for &s;uch Members as they believed would be for the Repeal for the &s;ame? (3.) Whether or no they would live peaceably, and as Chri&s;ti|ans ought to live, with &s;uch as differed from them in Religion. Some Lord Lieutenants who refu&s;ed to comply with this Order, were turned out to give Place to Papi&s;ts, and the Deputy Lieutenants and Ju&s;tices of the Peace who did not return a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer, were for the mo&s;t Part dive&s;ted of Office.</P>
<P>This certainly was pu&s;hing the Point by much too far, nor could Men forbear won|dering to what Purpo&s;e it could be meant; for what An&s;wer could any Gentleman pre|tend to give 'till he had heard the Rea&s;on|ings and Debates of the Hou&s;e? And who could pretend to an&s;wer for the Man he voted to be a Member; or pretend to be &s;ure of what Sort of a Mind he would be when he got to his Seat in the Hou&s;e? If the ge|neral Inclination had been to deceive the King, how ea&s;y was it for Men to expre&s;s them&s;elves one way and re&s;olve another? Be&s;ides it was &s;triking at the very Founda|tion of Parliaments, thus to pre-engage the
<PB N="253" REF="256">
Members, who according as Things, upon  their Meeting, appeared to them, are by the Laws of the Land allowed Freedom of Speech, and Freedom of Judgment. But the mo&s;t general An&s;wer that was returned by the Prote&s;tants of the Church of <HI>England</HI> was, That they, if of the Hou&s;e, would &s;o Vote as the Rea&s;ons of the Debate &s;hould prevail with them; that they would vote for &s;uch as they thought would do the &s;ame; and that they would live quietly with all Men as good Chri&s;tians and loyal Subjects. A|bout this Time there were great Removes of Officers, Civil and Military, and mo&s;t Cor|porations were purged of their Church of <HI>England</HI> Aldermen, and Papi&s;ts or Di&s;&s;en|ters appointed to &s;ucceed them. The King, however, &s;oon after &s;eemingly abated of the rigor of this Scrutiny, tho' the Lord Lieute|nants continued the Inquiry in mo&s;t Coun|ties, but with very little Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>While this was tran&s;acting in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King was engaged in a high Di&s;pute with his Holine&s;s of <HI>Rome,</HI> concerning the Immunities and Franchi&s;es of Amba&s;&s;adors in that City, which tho' all the Princes of the Catholic Religion &s;ubmitted to the Re|gulation of, the King of <HI>France</HI> would not&punc; His Amba&s;&s;ador, who would have demand|ed
<PB N="254" REF="257">
 the antient Rights, was denied Audience, and per&s;i&s;ting in the Thing, was declared ex|communicated; the Cardinals were forbid|den to vi&s;it him as an Amba&s;&s;ador; and the Church of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> reputed the parochial Church of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, whither the Amba&s;&s;ador and his Retinue repaired to the midnight Ma&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s,</HI> was interdict|ed, for admitting him to partake of the Devotions of the Sea&s;on. Upon Notice of this, the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> was a&s;&s;embled, and the Attorney General drew up an Ap|peal from <HI>Rome</HI> to the next general Council, &s;etting forth that the Pope had no ju&s;t Claim to Infallibility; that he had no Power to excommunicate Princes; that his prie&s;tly Authority was of no Weight in Temporals; and that the Power of the Keys was abu&s;ed when &s;ub&s;ervient to evil Ends. That his Holine&s;s had not only in this acted contra|dictorily to his Character as Vicar, but al&s;o in refu&s;ing Bulls to &s;uch as his Maje&s;ty had nominated and recommended to the vacant Bi&s;hoprics in his own Kingdom, for no Rea|&s;on but becau&s;e they would not acknowlege him to be infallible, or as the <HI>Italian</HI> Doctors call him <HI>Univer&s;al Monarch;</HI> that by this Means there were no fewer than thirty Va|cancies un&s;upplied at this Day; and that the
<PB N="255" REF="258">
Pope's Ob&s;tinacy ought to be controled, as  as the Cu&s;tom had formerly been with the Church, by OEcumenic, or National Coun|cils, After this, and much more, the At|torney withdrew, and was by the Parlia|ment admitted as an Appellant in the Ca&s;e; the Pope's Bull was at the &s;ame Time de|clared void; it was forbidden to di&s;per&s;e it within any Part of the Kingdom, and or|dered that the King &s;hould be humbly en|treated to exert his Authority as to the Im|munities and Franchi&s;es of his Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Rome;</HI> and to call &s;uch Councils, or A&s;|&s;emblies of great Men, as might apply a Re|medy to the Di&s;orders that had ari&s;en from the long Vacancies of Archbi&s;hoprics and Bi&s;hoprics, and la&s;tly, that he would prohi|bit all Commerce with the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> nor &s;uffer any Money to be &s;ent thither.</P>
<P>This was a &s;trange Sort of a Scene to us in <HI>England.</HI> It was thought we were mo&s;t in|&s;eparably linked together with our neigh|bour Kingdom; but while the one is abject|ly endeavouring to crouch to the La&s;h, the other is &s;eemingly re&s;olved to &s;lip her Neck out of the Collar.

For according to the Suppo&s;ition, he was to be either in Parliament, or out of it; if he him&s;elf &s;hould be elected, he could not hone&s;tly promi&s;e which Way he &s;hould vote 'till he came to his Seat, and heard the Debates; and that if he was not elected, it would be quite im|po&s;&s;ible in any Degree to an&s;wer for the Man he &s;hould chu&s;e for his Repre&s;entative; that I believed mo&s;t Men thought a Liberty of Con&s;cience might be of U&s;e and Advan|tage to the Nation, if &s;ettled upon a proper Foundation, and with true Regard to the Rights and Privileges of the Church of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> To this he replied, that the King had openly declared the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould have any rea&s;onable Equivalent &s;he could de&s;ire for her Security, provided an

<P>Having at two &s;everal Times obtained Leave to repair to <HI>London,</HI> I there found Af|fairs to &s;tand much in the Po&s;ture I expected. The popi&s;h Party was very urgent with the King to pre&s;s the Repeal of the Laws again&s;t them, and the other as ob&s;tinate and head|&s;trong again&s;t it; and what brought the Di|&s;pute to a &s;till greater Degree of Warmth, was owing to what follows: His Maje&s;ty had lately renewed his Proclamation for Liberty of Con&s;cience, and given Order to the Bi&s;hops, to cau&s;e it be read in the Churches of their re&s;pective Dioce&s;es. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Order, remon&s;trated again&s;t this; &s;etting forth, in a Petition they pre&s;ented to the King, That they could not pay his Maje&s;ty Obedience in what he was plea&s;ed to require of them; that no Bi&s;hop, or Mini&s;ter of the Church of <HI>England</HI> could a&s;&s;ent to the Pro|clamation, which mu&s;t of cour&s;e be implyed

 by their reading it or cau&s;ing it to be read; that a Declaration of the &s;ame Nature, on the Part of the King, had been in Parlia|ment condemned twice in the late Reign; that therefore they might be liable to be called to an Account hereafter, for doing what had been adjudged contrary to Law; that tho' the King of him&s;elf could do no wrong, his Mini&s;ters or Agents were re&s;pon|&s;ible for whatever was done infractory of the Law; and tho' his Maje&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to declare a Liberty of Con&s;cience, it was, neverthele&s;s, the Duty of the Clergy, as much as in them lay, to per&s;uade Men into an adherence to their Communion; that for them to publi&s;h the King's Plea&s;ure, in the Manner required, would be the &s;ame as if they told the People They needed not to come to Church except they plea&s;ed; and that by the &s;ame Rule he might command them to read Ma&s;s in their Churches, and be found to obey: The&s;e and many other Arguments were, upon this Occa&s;ion, offer|ed by the Bi&s;hops; at which the King con|ceived &s;o violent a Di&s;plea&s;ure, that they were commanded to appear in Council be|fore him, on the 8th of <HI>June.</HI></P>

This they refu&s;ed to do, &s;aying they were not to engage them&s;elves under any Security of the Kind, 'till the Information or Indictment was found, and that by &s;o doing they &s;hould not only run counter to the Law, but betray the Liberty of the Peerage; upon which the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and his &s;ix Bre|thren, were committed Pri&s;oners to the Tower, a Severity mo&s;t deeply re&s;ented by the whole Church.

The Impri&s;on|ment of the Bi&s;hops was now uppermo&s;t in the Minds of mo&s;t of the People, who flocked to them in &s;uch Numbers, for their Ble&s;&s;ing, and to condole their hard U&s;age, that great and very extraordinary Remarks were made both of Per&s;ons and Behaviour.

 but the real Cau&s;e was to appea&s;e the Sea|men, who were ready to mutiny, on Ac|count of &s;ome of their Captains, who had publickly celebrated Ma&s;s in their Ships. The King flattered them all he could; went from Ship to Ship; called them his Chil|dren; &s;aid he had nothing to do with their Religion, and that he granted Liberty of Con&s;cience to all; but that he expected they would behave like Men of Honour and Courage when there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion for their Service; tho' they were &s;o far grati|fied that all the Prie&s;ts were ordered on Shore.

Some Days afterwards, carrying my Wife and

This, con&s;idering the Jealou&s;ies we were under on Account of Religion, the violent Di&s;contents about the Army, and the ill Time of the Day it was to call a Parliament for fre&s;h Supplies of Mo|ney, did very ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably di&s;quiet the Court. And now the fir&s;t Thing the <MILESTONE N="Aug. 24."

<P>De&s;igning for <HI>York,</HI> I took Leave of his <MILESTONE N="28" UNIT="date"> Maje&s;ty, but with terrible Apprehen&s;ions that he would put the &s;ame Que&s;tion to me

Ju&s;t at this Time I had News, that the Que&s;tion had been put, the Week before, to all our Ju&s;tices of the We&s;t-Riding, and that they had all an&s;wered in the Negative; &s;o that I could not but think I had a lucky e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I &s;ent Notice to the Mayor and others of <HI>York,</HI> that I intended to &s;tand for one of their Repre&s;entatives, at the en&s;uing Electi|on, and found the Magi&s;tracy would be for the mo&s;t Part again&s;t me, tho' I had good Encouragement from the other Citizens. The Truth is, I was at &s;ome Lo&s;s to know how to act in this Matter; I was not de&s;i|rous to be of this Parliament, not only be|cau&s;e I was grown infirm and almo&s;t unfit to attend the Duty of the Hou&s;e, but al&s;o becau&s;e I was afraid the King would expect more from me than my Con&s;cience would extend to; for as I was determined not to violate this on the one Side, &s;o I could hard|ly re&s;olve to offend &s;o good a Ma&s;ter on the other. In the&s;e Straits, I went to the King at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and &s;hewed him the Letters I
<PB N="269" REF="272" MS="y">
had &s;ent to <HI>York,</HI> and the An&s;wers I had  received thereto; de&s;iring his Maje&s;ty to indulge me with Replies to three Queries I had to make, (1.) Whether, &s;eeing the Conte&s;t was like to be both chargeable and difficult, and the Succe&s;s extremely doubt|ful, it was his Plea&s;ure I &s;hould &s;tand? He replied po&s;itively, I &s;hould. (2.) Whether, as the Oppo&s;ition was very &s;trong again&s;t me, he would impute it to my Remi&s;sne&s;s if I mi&s;carried? He promi&s;ed he would not. (3.) Whether he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me all he could to prevent my being baffled, and particular|ly by &s;uch Means as I &s;hould propo&s;e to him? His An&s;wer was, Yes; and he gave immediate Orders to the Lords for purging of Corporations, to make whatever Change or Alteration I de&s;ired in the City of <HI>York,</HI> and to put in or out, which the King it &s;eems had re&s;erved to him&s;elf by the la&s;t Charter, ju&s;t as I plea&s;ed. But I was care|ful of what I did in this Regard: I con&s;i|dered that if I put out none, it would look as if I had no Power, and deba&s;e me into Contempt; and that if I di&s;placed too ma|ny, it might exa&s;perate the City again&s;t me, make them believe I was too deep in the Court Intere&s;t, and prevent my Succe&s;s on the other Hand; I therefore only de&s;ired
<PB N="270" REF="273" MS="y">
 that the Lord Mayor might be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his Office, and Sir&mdash;<HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> appointed in his &s;tead, which would prevent his being a Member of Parliament; and that too, Mr. <HI>Edward Tom&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ram&s;den,</HI> who were my principal Friends in the former Election of me for <HI>York,</HI> and were afterwards turned out partly on my Account, might be re|&s;tored as Aldermen. Then taking leave of the King, and pre&s;ented him with &s;ome <HI>Roman</HI> Medals, which he took very kindly, he again charged me to do what I could to be cho&s;en.</P>
<P>I afterwards de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Brent,</HI> the Agent for Corporation Matters, that if he had the Power, I might with &s;ome others I &s;hould name, be added to the Bench of Ju&s;tices in that City, by a Writ of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he promi&s;ed me &s;hould be done. To leave this Affair for the pre&s;ent, there had at this Time been fifty <HI>Iri&s;hmen</HI> and Papi&s;ts &s;ent for from <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> in order to be incorporated into his Regiment. Every Captain was to have &s;ome; but Lieu|tenant Colonel <HI>Beaumont,</HI> and five Captains more, who were all that were then on the Spot, in Quarters at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> refu&s;ed to take a Man of them, &s;aying their Companies were complete, and that they were not to

part with good Soldiers and <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> to  make Room for &s;uch as were inferior to them and Foreigners; de&s;iring they might chu&s;e their own Men, or throw up their Commi&s;&s;ions. The Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> took great Offence at this, and &s;ending an Ac|count of it to the King, he di&s;patched twen|ty Hor&s;e to bring them up in Cu&s;tody to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Ca&s;tle, where they were to be tryed by a Council of War; and they were brought up accordingly.

<P>Mean while, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador had lately given the King A&s;&s;urances that their Preparations were not again&s;t us; but his Maje&s;ty, as if he made a Doubt of it, ordered great Things towards a Fleet for the Spring; and I was po&s;itively told, by one, that he had actually twenty five hundred thou&s;and Pounds in his Cof|fers.</P>

The next Day his Grace called together his De|puty Lieutenants, and asked them, If there was any Thing meant by their A&s;&s;embly on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> more than to make a Declaration of Loyalty to his Maje&s;ty? Whereupon Sir <HI>Henry Gooderick,</HI> who was one of them, de|clared plainly, That he intended to petition for a free Parliament, and hoped that the re&s;t, who &s;hould meet, would concur there|in, after the Example of a late Petition from &s;ome Bi&s;hops, and &s;ome Temporal Lords. The Duke took this &s;o much ami&s;s, that he declared he would not &s;tay to be af|fronted or overuled by his Deputies, and that he would be gone the next Day.

But he went away according to his Word, &s;aying no Body had been of his Side but my &s;elf.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Nov. 22." UNIT="date"> And now came the Day of Meeting; a fatal one I think. I would not go to them at the Common Hall, which was the Place appointed; nor indeed was I very well able, by rea&s;on of &s;ome Brui&s;es I had received by my Hor&s;e's falling upon me: But I heard that in the Mid&s;t of about a hundred Gen|tlemen who met, Sir <HI>Henry Gooderick</HI> deli|vered him&s;elf to this Effect; That there having been great Endeavours made by the Government of late Years to bring Popery into the Kingdom, and by many Devices to &s;et at nought the Laws of the Land, there could be no proper Redre&s;s of the many Grievances we laboured under, but by a free Parliament; that now was the only Time to prefer a Petition of the Sort; and that they could not imitate a better Pattern than had been &s;et before them by &s;everal Lords Spiritual and Temporal. There were tho&s;e
<PB N="286" REF="289" MS="y">
 who differed with him in Opinion, and would have had &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in the Pa|per moderated and amended; and ob&s;erved that at the &s;ame time they petitioned as they de&s;igned, it would be but their Duty to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty, They would &s;tand firm by him in the mid&s;t of the Dangers which threatned both him and his King|doms, at the Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes; but this was overuled. When therefore the Draught was completed ac|cording to the Mind of Sir <HI>Henry Gooderick</HI> and his Friends, tho' &s;everal di&s;liked it and went away, they proceeded to &s;ign; but be|fore a third Man could &s;ub&s;cribe it, in comes one Mr. <HI>Tankard</HI> with a rueful Story That the Papi&s;ts were ri&s;en; and that they had actually fired upon the Militia Troops. A|larmed at this, the Gentlemen ran out; and tho&s;e that were privy to the De&s;ign betook them to their Hor&s;es, which were conveni|ently at hand for their Purpo&s;e. Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> mean while in his Lodging, waited for the fal&s;e Alarm, and mounted, with his Son, Lord <HI>Lumley,</HI> Lord <HI>Horton,</HI> Lord <HI>Wil|loughby</HI> and others, who, together with their Servants, formed a Body of Hor&s;e, con|&s;i&s;ting of a Hundred in Number, well mount|ed, and well accoutred. The&s;e rode up to
<PB N="287" REF="290" MS="y">
the four Militia Troops, drawn out on ano|ther  Account, and cryed out <HI>A free Parlia|ment, the Prote&s;tant Religion, and no Popery.</HI> The Captains of the&s;e Troops were Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Gower,</HI> Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> and Captain <HI>Tankard,</HI> who being admitted of the Secret the Night before, tho' prompt and ready enough in their Nature for any Action of the Kind, immediately cryed out the &s;ame, and led their Troops over to them. In the fir&s;t Place they went to the main Guard of the &s;tanding Company, which, the Number not exceeding twenty, they &s;urpri&s;ed, before I had the lea&s;t Notice or even Jealou&s;y of what was in Agitation; not thinking it po&s;&s;ible that Men of &s;uch Qua|lity, &s;uch E&s;tates, could give Way to their Di&s;content, however great and ju&s;t it might be, to the Degree of engaging them&s;elves in an Attempt &s;o de&s;perate, and &s;o contrary to the Laws they boa&s;ted, and the Religi|on they profe&s;&s;ed. But I had no &s;ooner No|tice of what had been tran&s;acted, than I &s;ent for the Officers and the Guard, and un|der&s;tood they were Pri&s;oners. I then &s;ent to each Captain of the four Troops, injoin|ing him to bring his Troop to me as the King's Governor, as al&s;o to the Main Guard of the Militia Foot; but they would not
<PB N="286" REF="291" MS="y">
 &s;tir a Step; they would hearken to no Or|ders. I then &s;ent for my own Hor&s;es, and was ju&s;t ready to go to the Troops, in hopes, by my Pre&s;ence, to regain them to the King's Service, when Sir <HI>Henry Bella&s;&s;is,</HI> who had commanded a Regiment in <HI>Holland,</HI> under the Prince, and had lurked about a long while in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> for his Highne&s;s's Service, drew up a Party of thirty Hor&s;e before my Door, and prevented my &s;tirring abroad till Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> and his principal Companions, came up to me.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip told me that to re&s;i&s;t were to no manner of End or Purpo&s;e; that him|&s;elf, and the Gentlemen with him, were in Arms for a free Parliament, and the Pre&s;er|vation of the Prote&s;tant Religion and Go|vernment, as by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed, which the King had almo&s;t brought to nothing, and which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was come to re|&s;tore; and that he hoped I would join them in &s;o laudable an Effort. I made An&s;wer that I was for a free Parliament and the Pro|te&s;tant Religion as well as they, but that I was al&s;o for the King: His Lord&s;hip re|plyed, that he was &s;o too, and that he hop|ed as we agreed in Principles, we &s;hould concur in Action: I told him tho' we exact|ly agreed in the Matter, we differed widely
<PB N="287" REF="292" MS="y">
as to the Manner; and I could not conceive  it lawful to extort any Thing from the Crown by any manner of Force; and that as I had the Honour of being his Maje&s;ty's Gover|nor for <HI>York,</HI> it was impo&s;&s;ible, whatever the Con&s;equences might be, for me to join in Concert with tho&s;e who openly and avow|edly acted in repugnance to and contempt of his Authority and Commi&s;&s;ion. His Lord|&s;hip then &s;aid, he mu&s;t impri&s;on me; to which I made An&s;wer, that I was naked and de&s;titute of Friends and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that I acknowledged my &s;elf in his Lord|&s;hips Power to do with me as he would: But after &s;ome &s;hort Con&s;ultation, his Lord|&s;hip told me, he knew me to be a Man of Honour, and that he &s;hould think my En|gagement not to &s;tir, to be as &s;ure and as clo&s;e a Re&s;traint upon me, as a Guard or a Pri&s;on; &s;o that upon the Pledge of my Ho|nour I was to confine my &s;elf to my Room; his Lord&s;hip, however, recommended what he had offered to my farther Con&s;ideration. They then &s;eized on all the Gates, po&s;ted &s;trong Guards every where, and &s;uffered none to go in or out; they &s;ecured &s;uch Per&s;ons as betrayed a Di&s;like to their Pro|ceedings, and e&s;pecially the Officers of the

They &s;eized al&s;o on a Company of Foot new rai&s;ed, but not yet armed, in their Quarters at <HI>Tadca&s;ter,</HI> and a Company of Grenadiers as they were on their March for <HI>London,</HI> by the Way of <HI>York;</HI> but as yet they touched the Property of no Man but the Kings, the Papi&s;ts and my &s;elf excepted, for they made very free with my Coals, and other Provi&s;ion I had &s;aid in for the U&s;e of the Garri&s;on.</P>

This Declaration
<PB N="289" REF="294" MS="y">
being the next Day printed, there appeared  of Hands of Lords to it, &s;ix; of Lords Sons, three; of Baronets, five; of Knights, &s;ix; of E&s;quires and Gentlemen, &s;ixty &s;ix; and of Citizens of <HI>York,</HI> fifty &s;ix. We had now News from <HI>Nottingham,</HI> that the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> Lord <HI>Delamere,</HI> and many more Noblemen and Gentlemen were ri&s;en al&s;o in tho&s;e Parts, and that great Numbers flocked in to them.</P>
<P>Mean while the King was on his March to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> which he had appointed to be the general Rendezvous of his whole Army, having &s;ent the young Prince, his Son, to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> as the Report was by &s;ome, but to <HI>France</HI> according to others. In a Day or two, I made it my Reque&s;t to the Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> that he would give me leave to be a Pri&s;oner at my own Hou&s;e in the Country, where I promi&s;ed to act nothing to his Pre|judice, but to aquie&s;ce, and abide by my Word as a true Pri&s;oner. Hereupon he &s;ent for me to come and dine with him; and at my coming into the Room told me, That to give me the better Stomach to my Meal, I might, upon the Terms I had pro|po&s;ed, depart whenever I plea&s;ed. At Din|ner his Lord&s;hip told me the Duke of <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI>'s Ab&s;ence had been what principally
<PB N="290" REF="295" MS="y">
 favoured their De&s;ign; and that he doubted not but I had &s;ome Fear or Su&s;picion of what was going forward: I an&s;wered, that I did indeed believe they would go very high in their Petition, but never imagined &s;o many Gentlemen of their Rank and Qua|lity would have ventured upon &s;o perilous an Expedient; and that if I had been aware of it, I &s;hould certainly have made a Re&s;i|&s;tance, tho' to ever &s;o little Purpo&s;e, or at lea&s;t have made my E&s;cape out of the Town. I had Di&s;cour&s;e with &s;everal of the&s;e Gen|tlemen, and perceived that they began to reflect on what they had done, as of more Danger than they at fir&s;t thought of, and found they were troubled, that Men come in &s;o &s;lowly to them. Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> &s;aid it was the fir&s;t Time that any <HI>Bertie</HI> had been concerned again&s;t the Crown; that it was a Grief to him, but that the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Times was fatally &s;uch, that there had been no avoiding it. To this I ob&s;erved, that the flagrant Inva&s;ion on our Rights might have been re&s;trained without a Re|pe&s;&s;ing Force, and that a thorough and plain repre&s;entation of our Injuries, properly urg|ed on the Part of the whole Kingdom, could not have failed to reduce the King to a bet|ter and ju&s;ter Sen&s;e of what he was about;
<PB N="291" REF="296" MS="y">
that the great want of Money, the violent  Di&s;traction of the Nation, and a plain Di&s;|covery that Popery could never again be impo&s;ed upon us, would have obliged his Maje&s;ty, for his own Sake, for his own Safety and Intere&s;t, to have altered the Te|nor of his Conduct. Sir <HI>Henry Gooderick</HI> would then have per&s;uaded me to &s;ign their Declaration, but I told them I could not po&s;&s;ibly do it; for that tho' I &s;hould be of a Mind with them, as to the Matter it con|tained, yet being now in Arms I could not, in my Judgment, conceive but a Concur|rence with them, as to the Contents of their Paper, might be ju&s;tly con&s;trued into a join|ing with them in the Force. Mr. <HI>Tankard</HI> al&s;o mo&s;t earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed me to be with them, but I held out. In the mid&s;t of this comes the Clerk of the Peace to give me No|tice of a new Commi&s;&s;ion that was brought down, which re&s;tored all the Gentlemen of the We&s;t Riding I have formerly ob&s;erved to have been turned out; but that my&s;elf and two more were omitted. Lord <HI>Danby</HI> immediately took up this, and told me it was plain There was a Re&s;entment again&s;t me, and that it was very evident I &s;hould meet with wor&s;e Quarter on the other Side, than from them; but all this had no manner
<PB N="292" REF="297" MS="y">
 of Effect upon me. The next Day the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> &s;ent Orders to his Captains of Hor&s;e to di&s;mi&s;s the Militia Troops; but they in&s;tead of obeying his Orders, laughed at him for his ill-timed Me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>This Day I obtained a Pa&s;s of their Ge|neral&s;hips to go to my own Home, upon my Parole that I would confine my &s;elf there, nor exceed the Bounds of five Miles about, and live peaceably and quietly, and ab&s;tain from all Manner of ho&s;tile Action. We had now News as if the Army had voted for a free Parliament, tho' at the &s;ame Time they declared they would defend his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on from all Men without Exception; the very Matter I de&s;ired to be the Con|tents of our <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Petition.

<P>The Rabble had been before &s;ufficiently incen&s;ed again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, but now appre|hending, and rea&s;onably enough, That the King had withdrawn him&s;elf by their Ad|vice, or rather at their In&s;tigation, they grew to that Height of Outrage, that ri&s;ing in prodigious Multitudes, and dividing them|&s;elves

<P>The King, however, upon his Departure wrote to the general Officers of his Army, &s;ignifying, That Things being brought to Extremities, and being obliged to &s;end a|way the Queen and the Prince, he was forced to follow him&s;elf; but hoped it might, at &s;ome Time or other, plea&s;e God to touch the Hearts of this Nation with true Loyalty and Honour. That could he but have tru&s;ted to his Troops, he would at lea&s;t have had one Blow for it; but that tho' there were &s;ome loyal and brave Men among them, both Of|ficers and Soldiers, it was their Advice to him not to venture him&s;elf at their Head, or to fight the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with them. He thanked tho&s;e for their Fidelity who had been true to him; and added, That tho' he did not expect they &s;hould expo&s;e them&s;elves, by re&s;i&s;ting a foreign Army, and a poi&s;oned Nation, he hoped they would pre&s;erve them&s;elves di&s;engaged from A&s;&s;o|ciations and all &s;uch evil Doings.

Being brought to Shore, he went to Lord <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI>'s, where he was taken with ano|ther Fit of Bleeding at the No&s;e, which made him very weak and very &s;ick.

<P>The Prince, upon his Arrival, &s;eemed more inclined to the Presbyterians than to the Members of the Church, which &s;tartled the Clergy; he ordered as many of the King's Forces to be gathered together as po&s;&s;ible, and confined Lord <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Ca&s;tle for having disbanded them, and for other Matters laid to his Charge; nor mu&s;t we forget, That his Highne&s;s a&s;|&s;umed &s;o much to him&s;elf, as to make the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> wait full four Hours before he would give him Admittance.

Their Lord&s;hips took &s;ome Time to con&s;ider on the An&s;wer they were to make; but while they were in the mid&s;t of their Deliberation, he gratifyed him&s;elf in his own De&s;ire, and went private|ly away.

<PB N="311" REF="316" MS="y">
wondered my Friend, the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Hal|lifax,</HI>  had been &s;o eager for the King's hav|ing abdicated the Government, when he ab|&s;olutely knew his Maje&s;ty had never gone, if he had not been frightned into it. She a&s;&s;ured me his Lord&s;hip had treated with the King to come again into Bu&s;ine&s;s, a few Weeks before the Prince's Intention was certainly known: That &s;he was the very Per&s;on his Lord&s;hip &s;ent to the King; that the King actually gave him a Meeting at her Hou&s;e: That they had agreed upon Terms; nay, what is more, that his Lord&s;hip had treated with &s;ome Prie&s;ts for his Return to Court. That upon this Account his Maje&s;ty particularly depended upon him, when he named him one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to go to the Prince; that after having conferred with his Highne&s;s, he &s;ent the King a private Letter, intimating an ill De&s;ign a|gain&s;t his Per&s;on, and that this was the real Cau&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's Flight, and the De|parture of the Queen. That after the King was brought back, Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> was one of the Peers that came and admoni&s;hed him, on Behalf of the Prince, to leave <HI>Whitehall,</HI> for <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Ham,</HI> within the &s;hort Space of two Hours; and that his Lord&s;hip's Rea|&s;on for conveying this ungrateful Me&s;&s;age to
<PB N="312" REF="317">
 his Maje&s;ty, was, That he was a&s;&s;ured the Prince's Party had in Council re&s;olved to &s;eize on his Per&s;on, and impri&s;on him: That upon the whole it mu&s;t be notoriou&s;ly known to his Lord&s;hip that the King had no man|ner of Inclination to withdraw either the fir&s;t or the &s;econd Time; and that he was compelled thereto out of a Principle of mere Self-pre&s;ervation. She farther imparted to me That the the King was &s;o terribly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of his Danger, and &s;o deeply afflicted when the Prince&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> went away, that it di&s;ordered him in his Under&s;tanding, but that he recovered pretty well upon his Re|turn. She continued, That the &s;econd Time he went away he &s;o little de&s;igned any &s;uch Thing, that he knew not which way to &s;et forward; one while he re&s;olved to go north|ward, and throw him&s;elf into the Hands of the Lord <HI>Danby;</HI> another, he had Thoughts of going to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> or the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter;</HI> that &s;he her&s;elf was &s;ent to the&s;e la&s;t, to know if they would re|ceive and &s;ecure him, and that they neither accepted the Motion, nor rejected it. She told me moreover, That the Lords intend|ed to make U&s;e of the Marqui&s;s for the Prince's Service, but were far from intend|ing him any Advantage thereby: That his
<PB N="313" REF="318">
Lord&s;hip having been the fir&s;t that advi&s;ed  the taking away of the Charters, he would be in &s;ome Danger of being called to an Ac|count for it, as &s;oon as the Government was well &s;ettled; as well as for other Articles, he having great Enemies among the Party to which he adhered; at la&s;t &s;he de&s;ired me if po&s;&s;ible &s;o to contrive that &s;he might &s;peak to his Lord&s;hip, and endeavour to moderate him &s;o far as to make him think well of a Regency, and not hurry on &s;o fa&s;t for a Forfeiture or Abdication. I told her I would do what I could in it; but was &s;en&s;ible his Lord&s;hip was too far engaged to recede. The &s;ame Lady again told me a great Lord of <HI>Scotland</HI> had, but a few Days before, a&s;&s;ured her, That in Ca&s;e the two Hou&s;es agreed to make the Government vacant, that Kingdom would chu&s;e for her&s;elf, be no more a Province to <HI>England,</HI> nor give no longer Attendance at the Door of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court.</P>
<P>The Lords this Day did nothing more than order the 8th of <HI>February,</HI> which u&s;ed to be kept as the Anniver&s;ary of his Ma|je&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion, to be no longer ob&s;erv|ed as a Fe&s;tival; and &s;ent down their Re|&s;olution to the Commons concerning the Abdication and other Matters thereto re|lating: Which the Commons, the Day af|ter,

<PB N="317" REF="322">
That &s;he then remon&s;trated to him that  though he was &s;o deeply at pre&s;ent imbark|ed in another Intere&s;t, he could not be well too cautious; for that the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> would mo&s;t certainly get the Start of him, and play him the &s;ame Game in this Court, Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> had in the other; that all they were now doing tottered upon an un|certain Foundation; that <HI>Scotland</HI> would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly chu&s;e her own King; that <HI>Ireland</HI> was probably lo&s;t and gone, the Lord Deputy <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> being there at the Head of an Army of 40000 Men; and that <HI>England</HI> her&s;elf was much divided, and in great Di&s;traction, with much more to the &s;ame Effect; That his Lord&s;hip him&s;elf con|fe&s;&s;ed there were but &s;mall Hopes of a la&s;t|ing Peace from this Settlement, tho' by far the be&s;t that could be formed at this Time of the Day; and that as he was well aware of the great Intere&s;t &s;he had with the King, he hoped &s;he would upon Occa&s;ion be his Friend, as he would be hers whenever &s;he might &s;tand in Need of him. The Truth is, &s;he dealt more roundly with him than any Body el&s;e could have ventured to do with &s;o great a Man; but his Lord&s;hip knew her well, and was prepared for all &s;he had to &s;ay;

<P>There were mo&s;t certainly great and vio|lent Di&s;contents at this Time, and the Cau&s;es thereof were the&s;e; The Prince had declared he had no De&s;ign upon the Crown, and now &s;ought it all he could; he came to &s;ettle the Prote&s;tant Religion, and yet brought over 4000 Papi&s;ts with him in his Army, a Number not far &s;hort of what the King had in his, but then the former were Foreigners, the latter, for the mo&s;t Part, <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> public Declaration had been made that the Birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was fal&s;e or &s;uppo&s;itious; that there was a pri|vate Treaty made with <HI>France</HI> to in&s;lave <HI>England,</HI> that the Murder of the late King and of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> would be amply made out; and yet nothing of all this ap|peared, excepting &s;ome &s;mall Circum&s;tances relating to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex:</HI> Then the Prince kept his <HI>Dutch</HI> Forces in Town, while the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were marched off to re|mote Quarters; his Highne&s;s declared he intended to keep his own Men here, and to &s;end ours to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> the Prin|ce&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI> was po&s;t-poned in the Succe&s;&s;ion; &s;everal Noblemen were di&s;ap|pointed

<P>The two Hou&s;es having agreed upon a Li&s;t of Grievances and U&s;urpations, and the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> being now &s;afe ar|rived, they both in a Body attended their Highne&s;s's, who &s;at in two Chairs of State, in the banquetting Hou&s;e, <HI>Whitehall,</HI> where <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="date"> the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Lords having read their Grievances and de&s;ired Redre&s;s, at the &s;ame Time made them an Offer of the Crowns of <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with all the Dependancies and Dominions thereunto belonging. The Prince in a &s;hort Speech told them He did accept of the &s;ame, and would do all he could for the Pre&s;ervation of their Liberties; and then went away with the Prince&s;s; while the Heralds and &s;everal of the Nobility pro|ceeded to proclaim them King and Queen,
<PB N="320" REF="325" MS="y">
 in the u&s;ual Form. The Remainder of the Day was &s;pent in Joy and Acclamation; tho' &s;ome there were who had but a &s;orrow|ful Countenance in the mid&s;t thereof.</P>
<P>The chief of the Articles the Convention demanded Redre&s;s of, were, Su&s;pen&s;ion of the Laws, or their Execution by the King, without the Con&s;ent of Parliament; the pre|tended Power to di&s;pen&s;e with Laws; the Court of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ioners; the rai&s;ing of Money by Prerogative; the keep|ing up a &s;tanding Force in Times of Peace, without the Con&s;ent of Parliament; the Ob|&s;tructions made to the free Choice of Mem|bers to repre&s;ent the People; the Bars to Freedom of Speech in Parliament; and the Impo&s;ition of exce&s;&s;ive Bail, or Fines. The Hou&s;es then de&s;ired the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the two following taken in their &s;tead; <HI>I</HI> A B, <HI>do &s;incerely promi&s;e and &s;wear that I will be faithful and bear true Allegiance to their Ma|je&s;ties King</HI> William <HI>and Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>&s;o help me God.&mdash;I</HI> A.

<P>The Days following, the Hou&s;es being adjourned for &s;ome Time, were taken up in Congratulations to the new King, who&s;e Numbers, on this Occa&s;ion, were un&s;peaka|ble; in naming and &s;wearing a new privy Council; by who&s;e Advice his Maje&s;ty be|gan fir&s;t with appointing the great Officers of the Court and the Kingdom; while the grand Expectation was, who would have the Preference <HI>Hallifax</HI> or <HI>Danby.</HI> The latter certainly hoped to be Lord Trea&s;urer; but the former a&s;&s;ured me he was di&s;ap|pointed, and obliged to take up with the Pre&s;idency of the Council, a Place of great Honour and Credit, but very &s;mall Profit; while <HI>Hallifax</HI> him&s;elf was made Lord Pri|vy Seal, of his own Choice, an Office of great Tru&s;t, and worth full three thou&s;and Pounds a Year. Before this was publickly known, his Lord&s;hip told me <HI>Danby</HI> was down in the Mouth, and would not &s;uffer his Neighbours to be a little quiet about him, and that for his own Part, as they yet
<PB N="322" REF="327" MS="y">
 &s;tood &s;eemingly fair together, he would give him no ju&s;t Occa&s;ion of Offence.</P>
<P>The King being thus &s;eated in the Throne, the great Bu&s;ine&s;s was to procure &s;uch a Parliament as would confirm what the Convention had done; and becau&s;e a new Election might carry &s;ome Hazard with it, or, as was pretended, might be the Lo&s;s of Time, when the Exigencies of the State required &s;uch immediate Di&s;|patch, it was, after great Di&s;putes between the Lawyers as to the Legality of the Thing, and warm Debates in both Hou&s;es agreed That the Convention &s;hould be con|verted <MILESTONE N="Feb. 23." UNIT="date"> into a Parliament; which was ac|cordingly done by a Bill framed for that Purpo&s;e, which having fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Lords, was tran&s;mitted down to the Commons, who having pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame, it was at length offered to the Royal A&s;|&s;ent, which was granted of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And thus was a Parliament obtained, af|ter an extraordinary Manner it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, but being thus con&s;tituted they proceeded to prepare &s;everal Bills, and particularly one for a Comprehen&s;ion, and <MILESTONE N="28" UNIT="date"> another for the Toleration of Prote&s;tant Di&s;|&s;enters, which being moved by Lord <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Peers, was &s;e|conded
<PB N="323" REF="328" MS="y">
by &s;ome Bi&s;hops, tho' more out of  Fear than Inclination; and a third for the rai&s;ing of 400,000 Pounds by a Tax upon Land.</P>
<P>And now Lord <HI>Arran,</HI> who had been a little before a&s;&s;aulted in <HI>Leice&s;ter-Fields</HI> by eight Ruffians, and had, at a Meeting of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Nobility in <HI>London,</HI> propo&s;ed to recall King <HI>James,</HI> was committed Pri&s;oner to the Tower, and many of the &s;ame No|bility being on the Point of &s;etting for|ward for the Convention in their King|dom, were &s;topped. The &s;ame Day, I dined with the Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> who treated me with more Intimacy and Freedom than I expected; his Lord&s;hip &s;aid He had made a fair Report of me to the King, when he gave him an Account of the Sur|pri&s;al of <HI>York;</HI> but I found him extremely cooled with regard to Affairs, as now ma|naged. He &s;aid that being embarked with his All, he was &s;orry to &s;ee Things no bet|ter conducted; that <HI>Ireland</HI> was in a man|ner become invincible by our Neglect of &s;ending Forces thither before now; that with regard to this, and other material Points, equally unheeded, he had been pre&s;&s;ing with the King to a Degree even of Incivility; that he had told his Maje|&s;ty,
<PB N="324" REF="329" MS="y">
 He plainly &s;aw he did all he could to encourage the Presbyterians and to di&s;hear|ten the Church, which could not but be ab|&s;olutely prejudicial both to him&s;elf and the Government; tho' he at the &s;ame Time ob|&s;erved that his Maje&s;ty interfered but little in Councils, being prevented therefrom partly by Inclination, and partly by want of Health. Indeed the King looked but ill, and the Difficulty he laboured under in &s;wallowing, &s;eemed to foretel him a Man of &s;hort Continuance in this World. His Lord&s;hip farther told me He had been ap|pointed Pre&s;ident of the Council quite a|gain&s;t his Will, after the King had declar|ed he could not give him the Staff of Trea|&s;urer, determined, as he was, that the Trea&s;ury &s;hould be in the Hands of Com|mi&s;&s;ioners; that he had been offered to be Secretary of State and Pre&s;ident both at the &s;ame Time, and that he had declined the fir&s;t; that all he had asked of the King for him&s;elf, was a Patent to which he had a Right by a former Grant, and that he would al&s;o be plea&s;ed to gratify &s;ome Gen|tlemen who had, upon this Revolution, joined him in the North; in fine, that the King had told him It would be by no Means for his Intere&s;t to be out of all Bu&s;ine&s;s; and
<PB N="325" REF="330" MS="y">
that he had, in a Manner, forced the Pre&s;i|dent&s;hip  upon him, His Lord&s;hip expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf doubtful of the Continuance of Af|fairs, as they now &s;tood, and informed me That King <HI>James</HI> had &s;ent down to him in the North, offering to throw him&s;elf into his Hands before he went away. To this, he &s;aid, his An&s;wer was, by <HI>Charles Bertie</HI> who brought the Me&s;&s;age, That his own Force, which he depended upon in the North, was not &s;ufficient to tru&s;t to; but that if his Maje&s;ty would bring a con&s;idera|ble Party with him, and come without his Papi&s;ts, he would &s;ooner lo&s;e his Life than he &s;hould &s;uffer the lea&s;t Injury; but that the King having no Mind to part with his Romans, would not come. His Lord&s;hip then &s;aid That if the King would but quit his Papi&s;ts, it might po&s;&s;ibly not be too late yet for him. He then ob&s;erved That the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> a Papi&s;t, and Governor of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Ca&s;tle, the only Magazine in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was lately ready and willing to &s;urrender it to any Body, now held it out ob&s;tinately for King <HI>James;</HI> and that the Di&s;contents in <HI>England</HI> grew greater daily and greater. He then reflected on Lord <HI>Hallifax,</HI> the King, and all about him, as mo&s;t &s;trangely infatuated with Notions
<PB N="326" REF="331" MS="y">
 of their own Security; and particularly ani|madverted on the la&s;t mentioned Lord for in&s;i&s;ting with &s;uch Violence, in a Speech of his, That the Prince &s;hould be entitled Le|gal and Rightful King of this Realm, (which I &s;uppo&s;e the Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> did with a View of continuing the old Oaths of Alle|giance and Supremacy, and to obviate all Scruple about taking the new) &s;aying it was mere Non&s;en&s;e; for that had the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> been made King, he could never have been deemed our lawful Sovereign, while his Father lived. But his Lord&s;hip neverthele&s;s appeared very &s;erious and ur|gent about the Legality of taking the new Oaths, and condemned the Bi&s;hops for their Squeami&s;hne&s;s in that Re&s;pect, tho' they them&s;elves had had &s;o large a Hand in bring|ing about this great and extraordinary Change; and thereupon quoted Lord <HI>Not|tingham</HI>'s Speech, who, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, had ob&s;erved That tho' he had ne|ver in the lea&s;t con&s;ented to this Revoluti|on, but had with all his Might oppo&s;ed the Prince's Acce&s;&s;ion, as contrary to Law; yet &s;ince his Highne&s;s was here, and we mu&s;t owe our Protection to him as King <HI>de facto,</HI> he thought it but ju&s;t and legal to &s;wear Al|legiance to him. I have been the more ex|act
<PB N="327" REF="332" MS="y">
in the particulars of this Conver&s;ation,  to give the better In&s;ight into the Thoughts of the greate&s;t Men upon this Occa&s;ion; tho' I wondered his Lord&s;hip would venture to be &s;o very undi&s;gui&s;ed with me; but he was &s;ure I would not betray him, tho' even to Lord <HI>Hallifax.</HI></P>
<P>The very &s;ame Day, after &s;everal At|tempts of the Sort, the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Hallifax,</HI> now again Lord Privy Seal, pre&s;ented me to the King, having before reque&s;ted him that a young Son of mine might have my Com|pany, and that he might be excu&s;ed from Duty a Year or two, on Account of his E|ducation; but his Maje&s;ty thought it an ill Precedent, and would give no Ear to it. Having ki&s;&s;ed his Hand, I told him I had had the Honour of a Tru&s;t upon me from the late King to the very la&s;t, having been a Stranger to his De&s;igns till I &s;aw them in Execution, and that I could not then, in Honour or Ju&s;tice, comply with them; but that I was a firm Prote&s;tant, and had upon that Account been a Sufferer in my E&s;tate, concluding that I &s;hould be &s;trictly faithful to my Duty where&s;oever I &s;erved. My Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> then de&s;ired I might keep my Company without paying any Attendance, to which I &s;ubjoined, <HI>Sir, If you have re&s;olved</HI>

Having an Opportunity of &s;peaking to  him accordingly, I failed not to be as good as my Word; tho' I mu&s;t own, the Topic being of &s;o nice and tender a Sort, I did it with great Caution. However, I gave him plainly to under&s;tand That the chief Motive which induced the Lady to de&s;ire a Meet|ing with him, was to impart to him what might be for his own Good, and the Ser|vice of the Public. Hereupon he began to be more free and open with me than he had hitherto been, on this Chapter; and I told him, in general, that great De&s;igns were on Foot; he &s;aid He believed it, and that tho' Men &s;eemed to be for the pre&s;ent Inte|re&s;t, as mo&s;t prevalent, it was not altoge|ther di&s;creet to venture too far; that if Matters really were as I had &s;aid, it was but &s;afe to carry it fair with tho&s;e in the Oppo|&s;ition, and to let &s;ome People know He &s;poke always with great Re&s;pect of King <HI>James;</HI> that if we came to Blows, it was uncertain who would &s;trike harde&s;t; and that he &s;hould be glad to meet the Lady at my Hou&s;e, whenever &s;he plea&s;ed. But his Lord&s;hip, however, &s;aid all imaginable Care would be taken to ward off any Danger that might threaten us; that an Army of 20000 Men would be pre&s;ently rai&s;ed; that all &s;u&s;|picious
<PB N="330" REF="335" MS="y">
 Per&s;ons would be &s;ecured, the Par|liament intending to inve&s;t the King with a Power to impri&s;on whom he plea&s;ed, and to keep them in &s;afe Cu&s;tody till they came to a Tryal; and in fine, that the Parliament would mo&s;t plentifully furni&s;h the King for the Pro&s;ecution of the War. At this Time &s;everal Lords and Gentlemen of both Hou&s;es withdrew to their &s;everal Countries; and I was told That &s;ome who were out|wardly great Friends to the pre&s;ent Go|vernment, were treating for Terms on the other Side; which I communicated to his Lord&s;hip, and particularly made mention of &s;ome he little &s;u&s;pected.

<P>I waited on Lord <HI>Bella&s;&s;is,</HI> fir&s;t Commi&s;|&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury under the late King, who told me that tho' he was him&s;elf a Pa|pi&s;t, he had been quite aver&s;e to the Mea|&s;ures which had been taken to promote the Catholic Religion; but that his Council ne|ver had Weight, the Warm-ones having in|&s;inuated

to the King That it came from a  Man old and timerous, who having a great E&s;tate did not care to run any Hazard of it.

rather to march off in a Body with their  Arms and four Pieces of Cannon, towards <HI>Scotland,</HI> than obey Orders, which were to embark and &s;ail for <HI>Holland.</HI> Lord Privy Seal doing me the Honour of a Vi&s;it this Day, told me The King had &s;ent two Re|giments of <HI>Dutch</HI> Hor&s;e, and one of Dra|goons, after them; that if the <HI>Scotch</HI> Regi|ment had done this without Confederacy they were all lo&s;t; but that if any other of our Forces were in the Secret, and under Engagement to join and &s;upport them, there might be Danger in the Thing.

<P><MILESTONE N="March 22."

His Lord&s;hip continued That there was now great Hopes of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and in|deed the Kirk Party, which declared for King <HI>William,</HI> was by much the &s;tronge&s;t there. King <HI>James</HI> appeared too late in <HI>Ireland;</HI> but he had this to plead, the Winds would not permit him to &s;tir out of <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> &s;ooner than he did.

<P>The Affairs of all <HI>Europe</HI> were now &s;eem|ingly at a Stand, tho' Preparations were e|very where making for War; the Empire was mu&s;tering up all her Quota's again&s;t <HI>France</HI> on the one Hand, and the Turk on the other; <HI>Spain</HI> betrayed a Willingne&s;s to &s;ide with the Emperor; <HI>Sweden, Holland,</HI> and <HI>England</HI> were ready to do the &s;ame; while <HI>Denmark</HI> &s;eemed to be fixed to a Neutrality.

 of the whole Town; Mr. <HI>Temple,</HI> Son to Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> who had marryed a <HI>French</HI> Lady with 20,000 Pi&s;toles, a &s;edate and accompli&s;hed young Gentleman, who had lately, by King <HI>William,</HI> been made Secretary of War, took a Pair of Oars, and drawing near the Bridge, leapt into the <HI>Thames</HI> and drowned him&s;elf, leaving a Note behind him in the Boat, to this Effect, My Folly in Undertaking what I could not per|form, whereby &s;ome Misfortunes have be|fallen the King's Service, is the Cau&s;e of my putting my &s;elf to this &s;udden End; I wi&s;h him Succe&s;s in all his Undertakings, and a better Servant. A dangerous Thing it is for &s;ome Con&s;titutions to give Way to Di&s;|content, and imaginary Notion, but not to digre&s;s on this melancholy Subject;</P>
<P>The Parliament proceeded to rai&s;e Mo|ney, but upon Terms and Per&s;ons, that gave great Di&s;&s;atisfaction. The Poll was quite &s;trict, &s;carce a Soul being exempted therefrom, but &s;uch as received Alms, the Hou&s;e con&s;enting to a Grant of no le&s;s than four Millions for one Year only. And now Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> told me That the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen</HI>'s Retirement into the Country, his Pretences to be &s;ick, and his &s;o &s;eldom appearing at Court in&s;tilled fre&s;h Jealou&s;ies
<PB N="347" REF="352" MS="y">
of him; That he had heard he &s;hould &s;ay  Things could not long continue thus; That his Relations and Friends were very dange|rous in in their Di&s;cour&s;e, and that he him|&s;elf was very open; That he found this new Marqui&s;s had no Mind to be inward or inti|mate with him; That he &s;uppo&s;ed his Lord|&s;hip might imagine he had kept him at a Di|&s;tance from the Trea&s;urer's Staff; but that imagine what he would, he did not alto|gether de&s;erve it; that, of all Men, in the World, the King never would have inve&s;t|ed him with that Office, nor, indeed, with any other that was very con&s;iderable, as he would find, if Affairs but held out till <HI>Sep|tember.</HI> Hereupon I acquainted his Lord|&s;hip with &s;ome Grounds that made it &s;u&s;pe|cted the Pre&s;ident was di&s;contented. His Lord&s;hip then continued That for his own Part he found the King very well affected towards him&s;elf, that his Maje&s;ty did not only carry it fair to him, per&s;onally, but that from third Hands he had it That the King u&s;ed very kind Expre&s;&s;ions of him be|hind his Back; for that he gave him but ve|ry little Trouble either on account of him|&s;elf, or of other People, while the Lord Pre&s;ident knew no End of his Importunities. This urged me to &s;ay, That I did not know
<PB N="348" REF="353" MS="y">
 what his Lord&s;hip might thereby be a Lo&s;er with the King, but that he gained much with others I was certain; for that it was a common Saying No Lord u&s;ed his good Offices for his Countrymen but the Lord Pre&s;ident; and this I ob&s;erved, becau&s;e the Lord Privy Seal, tho' otherwi&s;e very kind and free with me, did not e&s;pou&s;e my Inte|re&s;t as I expected he would. But his Lord|&s;hip farther told me That the King being &s;o very inacce&s;&s;ible as he was, and confining him&s;elf &s;o to <HI>Hampton,</HI> when there was &s;uch ab&s;olute Need of the mo&s;t &s;tirring Action, was the De&s;truction of all Bu&s;ine&s;s. That he had de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty but to lye &s;ome|times in Town, and that his An&s;wer was, It was not to be done except his Lord&s;hip de&s;ired to &s;ee him dead, which, &s;aid my Lord, was a very &s;hort An&s;wer. To con|clude, he proceeded to &s;ay That if the King &s;urvived this Summer, which he thought he fairly might, notwith&s;tanding his con&s;umptive Diforder, or e&s;caped the murderous Hands of the Papi&s;ts, he doubted not but the Government would &s;tand firm tho' it devolved to the Queen &s;ingly; but that however the Concern he had for his Fa|mily would naturally tempt him to act with all the Moderation that might be; that up|on
<PB N="349" REF="354" MS="y">
this Con&s;ideration it was he had taken no  great or additional Places, no new Honours, no blue Ribbon, as others had done.</P>
<P>The next Day I was to go to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, where his Lord&s;hip was to meet me and pre&s;ent me to the King before I went into the Country. His Lord&s;hip repeated his Promi&s;es to do for me what he could, but &s;aid It would be but Di&s;cretion to let two or three Months pa&s;s over-head, be|fore I pre&s;&s;ed Matters too much, to the End we might the better &s;ee what was likely to become of Things.</P>
