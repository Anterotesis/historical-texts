<P>IT has been a general, and allow'd Cu&s;tom, in all Ages, for Poets, to lay their Works at &s;ome Great Man's Feet, and always to chu&s;e &s;uch as are eminently Con&s;picuous for their Ver|tues. This made <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ingle out <HI>Mecenas,</HI> and <HI>Terence</HI> court the Protection of <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius;</HI> which encourages me, in humble Imitation of tho&s;e Great Men, to beg <HI>your Grace's</HI> Pratro|nage for the following Scenes. It would be a kind of Poetical Sacrilege to offer them el&s;e where, &s;ince it wou'd rob <HI>your Grace</HI> of the Homage, to which your Quality, Sen&s;e, and good Nature, your Indulgence to Poetry, and your Judgment as well as Love for Mu&s;ick, give you an indi&s;put|able Title. Mu&s;ick is the Soul of Poe&s;y, and
<PB REF="4">
Numbers &s;ound mo&s;t &s;weet, when grac'd with &s;oft harmonious Strains.</P>
<P>I am the more forward, to pay this ju&s;t Debt, <HI>My Lord,</HI> becau&s;e without the help of Fiction, con&s;equently without the help of Flattery, I have a large Field for a Panegyrick; which, however, I &s;hall prudently decline, for fear of degrading your Vertues through my Inability and Meanne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion. Yet I cannot forbear mentioning the Excellency of <HI>your Grace's</HI> Temper, your Good|ne&s;s and Affability, and the Regard you have for that generous Cu&s;tom, which formerly di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, from all the re&s;t of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> Ho&s;pitality: which makes <HI>your Grace</HI> admired, and beloved to a degree, next Adoration, by all, who are &s;o happy as to approach you.</P>
<P><HI>Your Grace,</HI> is a true Pattern of Nobility: The prudent Management of your Affairs; your Voluntary Retreat from Noi&s;e and Vice, &s;hew you have a right Conception of the Joys of Life, as <HI>Cowley</HI> has de&s;crib'd them. To favour your Retirement, Nature &s;eems to have taken peculiar Care to indulge <HI>your Grace's</HI> Solitude, with all her choice Productions: For your Gardens exceed all that Poets feign.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">
That <HI>your Grace,</HI> may long enjoy tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings in perfect Health, and unmole&s;ted Peace, together with your Beauteous Lady; and that your Con|nubial Joys may produce a perfect Copy of their Parents, which may adorn the Age to come, with the &s;ame Singularity of Goodne&s;s, as <HI>your Grace</HI> does the pre&s;ent; are, <HI>My Lord,</HI> the &s;incere Wi&s;hes of,</P>
