<HEAD>THE LIFE OF THOMAS PARNELL, D.D.</HEAD>
<P>THE life of a &s;cholar &s;eldom abounds with adventure. His fame is ac|quired in &s;olitude, and the hi&s;torian who only views him at a di&s;tance, mu&s;t be content with a dry detail of actions by which he is &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of man|kind. But we are fond of talking of tho&s;e who have given us plea&s;ure; not that we have any thing important to &s;ay, but becau&s;e the &s;ubject is plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Thomas Parnell, D. D. was de&s;cended from an ancient family, that had for &s;ome centuries been &s;ettled at Congleton in Che&s;hire. His
<PB N="2" REF="4">
father, Thomas Parnell, who had been attach|ed to the commonwealth party, upon the re|&s;toration went over to Ireland; thither he car|ried a large per&s;onal fortune, which he laid out in lands in that kingdom. The e&s;tates he pur|cha&s;ed there, as al&s;o that of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Che&s;hire, de&s;cended to our poet, who was his elde&s;t &s;on, and &s;till remain in the family. Thus want, which has compelled many of our greate&s;t men into the &s;ervice of the Mu&s;es, had no influence upon Parnell; he was a poet by inclination.</P>
<P>He was born in Dublin, in the year 1679, and received the fir&s;t rudiments of his educati|on at the &s;chool of Doctor Jones in that city. Surpri&s;ing things are told us of the greatne&s;s of his memory at that early period, as of his be|ing able to repeat by heart forty lines of any book at the fir&s;t reading; of his getting the third book of the Iliad in one night's time, which was given in order to confine him for &s;ome days. The&s;e &s;tories, which are told of al|mo&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="5">
every celebrated wit, may perhaps be true. But for my own part, I never found any of tho&s;e prodigies of parts, although I have known enough that were de&s;irous, among the ignorant, of being thought &s;o.</P>
<P>There is one pre&s;umption, however, of the early maturity of his under&s;tanding. He was admitted a member of the college of Dublin at the age of thirteen, which is much &s;ooner than u&s;ual, as at that univer&s;ity they are a great deal &s;tricter in their examination for entrance, than either at Oxford or Cambridge. His progre&s;s through the college cour&s;e of &s;tudy was probably marked with but little &s;plendour; his imagination might have been too warm to reli&s;h the cold logic of Burger&s;dicius, or the dreary &s;ubtleties of Smigle&s;ius; but it is certain, that as a cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, few could equal him. His own compo&s;itions &s;hew this, and the dif|ference which the mo&s;t eminent men of his time paid him upon that head, put it beyond a doubt. He took the degree of Ma&s;ter of

Arts the ninth of July, 1700, and in the &s;ame year, he was ordained a deacon, by William, bi&s;hop of Derry, having a di&s;pen&s;ation from the primate, as being under twenty-three years of age. He was admitted into prie&s;t's orders about three years after, by William, arch|bi&s;hop of Dublin, and on the ninth of Fe|bruary, 1705, he was collated by Sir George A&s;he, bi&s;hop of Clogher, to the archdeaconry of Clogher. About that time al&s;o he married Mi&s;s Anne Minchin, a young lady of great merit and beauty, by whom he had two &s;ons, who died young, and one daughter, who is &s;till living. His wife died &s;ome time before him, and her death is &s;aid to have made &s;o great an impre&s;&s;ion on his &s;pirits, that it &s;erved to ha&s;ten his own. On the thirty-fir&s;t of May, 1716, he was pre&s;ented, by his friend and patron archbi&s;hop King, to the vicarage of Fingla&s;s, a benefice worth about four hundred pounds a year in the dioce&s;e of Dublin, but he lived to enjoy his preferment a very &s;hort time. He died at Che&s;ter, in July, 1717, on
<PB N="5" REF="9">
his way to Ireland, and was buried in Trinity church in that town, without any monument to mark the place of his interment. As he died without male i&s;&s;ue, his e&s;tate devolved to his only nephew, Sir John Parnell, baronet, who&s;e father was younger brother to the arch|deacon, and one of the ju&s;tices of the King's Bench in Ireland.</P>
<P>Such is the very unpoetical detail of the life of a poet. Some dates, and &s;ome few facts &s;carce more intere&s;ting than tho&s;e that make the ornaments of a country tomb-&s;tone, are all that remain of one who&s;e labours now begin to excite univer&s;al curio&s;ity. A poet, while living, is &s;eldom an object &s;ufficiently great to attract much attention; his real merits are known but to a few, and the&s;e are generally &s;paring in their prai&s;es. When his fame is in|crea&s;ed by time, it is then too late to inve&s;ti|gate the peculiarities of his di&s;po&s;ition; the dews of the morning are pa&s;t, and we vainly
<PB N="6" REF="10">
try to continue the chace by the meridian &s;plendour,</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any man but might be made the &s;ubject of a very intere&s;ting and amu&s;ing hi&s;tory, if the writer, be&s;ides a thorough ac|quaintance with the character he draws, were able to make tho&s;e nice di&s;tinctions which &s;e|parate it from all others. The &s;tronge&s;t minds have u&s;ually the mo&s;t &s;triking peculiarities, and would con&s;equently afford the riche&s;t ma|terials: but in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, from not knowing Doctor Parnell, his peculiarities are gone to the grave with him, and we are obliged to take his character from &s;uch as knew but little of him; or who, perhaps, could have given very little information if they had known more.</P>
<P>PARNELL, by what I have been able to col|lect from my father and uncle, who knew him, was the mo&s;t capable man in the world to make the happine&s;s of tho&s;e he conver&s;ed with,
<PB N="7" REF="11">
and the lea&s;t able to &s;ecure his own. He want|ed that evenne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition which bears di&s;|appointment with phlegm, and joy with in|difference. He was ever very much elated or depre&s;&s;ed; and his whole life &s;pent in agony or rapture. But the turbulence of the&s;e pa&s;&s;i|ons only affected him&s;elf, and never tho&s;e about him, he knew the ridicule of his own character, and very effectually rai&s;ed the mirth of his companions, as well at his vexations as at his triumphs.</P>
<P>How much his company was de&s;ired, ap|pears from the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his connexions, and the number of his friends. Even before he made any figure in the literary world, his friend&s;hip was &s;ought by per&s;ons of every rank and party. The wits at that time differed a good deal from tho&s;e who are mo&s;t eminent for their under&s;tanding at pre&s;ent. It would now be thought a very indifferent &s;ign of a writer's good &s;en&s;e to di&s;claim his private friends for happening to be of a different party in politics;
<PB N="8" REF="12">
but it was then otherwi&s;e, the Whig wits held the Tory wits in great contempt, and the&s;e retaliated in their turn. At the head of one party were Addi&s;on, Steele, and Congreve; at that of the other, Pope, Swift, and Arbuth|not. Parnell was a friend to both &s;ides, and with a liberality becoming a &s;cholar, &s;corned all tho&s;e trifling di&s;tinctions, that are noi&s;y for the time, and ridiculous to po&s;terity. Nor did he emancipate him&s;elf from the&s;e without &s;ome oppo&s;ition from home. Having been the &s;on of a commonwealth's man, his Tory con|nexions on this &s;ide of the water, gave his friends in Ireland great offence; they were much enraged to &s;ee him keep company with Pope, and Swift, and Gay; they blamed his undi&s;tingui&s;hing ta&s;te, and wondered what plea&s;ure he could find in the conver&s;ation of men who approved the Treaty of Utrecht and di&s;liked the duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>His conver&s;ation is &s;aid to have been ex|tremely plea&s;ing, but in what its peculiar ex|cellence
<PB N="9" REF="13">
con&s;i&s;ted is now unknown. The let|ters which were written to him by his friends, are all full of compliments upon his talents as a companion, and his good nature as a man. I have &s;everal of them now before me. Pope was particularly fond of his company, and &s;eems to regret his ab&s;ence more than any of the re&s;t. A letter from him follows thus:<LETTER>

<P>I Wi&s;h it were not as ungenerous as vain to complain too much of a man that for|gets me, but I could expo&s;tulate with you a whole day upon your inhuman &s;ilence; I call it inhuman; nor would you think it le&s;s, if you were truly &s;en&s;ible of the unea&s;ine&s;s it gives me. Did I know you &s;o ill as to think you proud, I would be much le&s;s concerned than I am able to be, when I know one of the be&s;t-natured men alive neglects me; and if you know me &s;o ill as to think ami&s;s of me, with regard to my friend&s;hip for you,

you really do not de&s;erve half the trouble you occa&s;ion me. I need not tell you, that both Mr. Gay and my&s;elf have written &s;everal let|ters in vain; and that we are con&s;tantly en|quiring of all who have &s;een Ireland, if they &s;aw you, and that (forgotten as we are) we are every day remembering you in our mo&s;t agreeable hours. All this is true, as that we are &s;incerely lovers of you, and deplorers of your ab&s;ence, and that we form no wi&s;h more ardently than that which brings you over to us, and places you in your old &s;eat between us. We have lately had &s;ome di&s;|tant hopes of the Dean's de&s;ign to revi&s;it England; will not you accompany him? or is England to lo&s;e every thing that has any charms for us, and mu&s;t we pray for bani&s;h|ment as a benediction?&mdash;I have once been witne&s;s of &s;ome, I hope all of your &s;plenetic hours, come and be a comforter in your turn to me, in mine. I am in &s;uch an un&s;ettled &s;tate, that I can't tell if I &s;hall ever &s;ee you, unle&s;s it be this year; whether I do or not,

be ever a&s;&s;ured, you have as large a &s;hare of my thoughts and good wi&s;hes as any man, and as great a portion of gratitude in my heart as would enrich a monarch, could he know where to find it. I &s;hall not die with|out te&s;tifying &s;omething of this nature, and leaving to the world a memorial of the friend|&s;hip that has been &s;o great a plea&s;ure and pride to me. It would be like writing my own epitaph, to acquaint you what I have lo&s;t &s;ince I &s;aw you, what I have done, what I have thought, where I have lived, and where I now repo&s;e in ob&s;curity. My friend Jervas, the bearer of this, will inform you of all particulars concerning me, and Mr. Ford is charged with a thou&s;and loves, and a thou&s;and commi&s;&s;ions to you on my part. They will both tax you with the neglect of &s;ome promi&s;es which were too agreeable to us all to be forgot; if you care for any of us tell them &s;o, and write &s;o to me.

<P>Pope him&s;elf was not only exce&s;&s;ively &s;ond of his company, but under &s;everal literary obli|gations to him for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the tran&s;la|tion of Homer. Gay was obliged to him upon another account; for being always poor, he was not above receiving from Parnell, the copy|money which the latter got for his writings. Several of their letters, now before me, are proofs of this, and as they have never appear|ed before, it is probable the reader will be much better plea&s;ed with their idle effu&s;ions, than with any thing I can hammer out for his amu&s;ement.</P>

For my own, I beg earne&s;tly of you to return to us as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. You know how very much I want you, and that however your bu&s;ine&s;s may depend upon any other, my bu|&s;ine&s;s depends entirely upon you, and yet &s;till I hope you will find your man, even though I lo&s;e you the mean while. At this time, the more I love you, the more I can &s;pare you; which alone will, I dare &s;ay, be a rea&s;on to you to let me have you back the &s;ooner. The minute I lo&s;t you, Eu&s;tathius with nine hun|dred pages, and nine thou&s;and contractions of the Greek characters, aro&s;e to view!

All the&s;e ru&s;hed upon my &s;oul at once, and whelmed me under a fit of the head|ach. I cur&s;ed them all religiou&s;ly, damn'd my be&s;t friends among the re&s;t, and even bla&s;phemed Homer him&s;elf. Dear Sir, not only as you are a friend, and a good-natured man; but as you are a chri&s;tian and a divine, come back &s;peedily, and prevent the increa&s;e of my &s;ins; for at the rate I have begun to rave, I &s;hall not only damn all the poets and commentators who have gone before me, but be damn'd my&s;elf by all who come after me. To be &s;erious, you have not only left me to the la&s;t degree impatient for your return, who at all times &s;hould have been &s;o; (tho' never &s;o much as &s;ince I knew you in be&s;t health here) but you have wrought &s;everal miracles upon our family; you have made old people fond of a young and gay per&s;on, and inve|terate

that I carry about with me, and which ri&s;es to my mind whenever I think of you; I have many an agreeable reverie, through tho&s;e woods and downs, where we once rambled together; my head is &s;ometimes at the Bath, and &s;ometimes at Letcomb, where the Dean makes a great part of my imaginary enter|tainment, this being the cheape&s;t way of treating me; I hope he will not be di&s;plea&s;ed, at this manner of paying my re&s;pects to him, in&s;tead of following my friend Jarvas's exam|ple, which to &s;ay the truth, I have as much inclination to do as I want ability.

</LETTER>
<P>From the&s;e letters to Parnell, we may con|clude, as far as their te&s;timony can go, that he was an agreeable, a generous, and a &s;incere man. Indeed he took care that his friends &s;hould always &s;ee him to the be&s;t advantage; for when he found his fits of &s;pleen and unea&s;i|ne&s;s, which &s;ometimes la&s;ted for weeks to|gether, returning, he returned with all expedi|tion to the remote parts of Ireland, and there made out a gloomy kind of &s;atisfaction, in giving hideous de&s;criptions of the &s;olitude to
<PB N="22" REF="26">
which he retired. It is &s;aid of a famous painter, that being confined in pri&s;on for debt, his whole delight con&s;i&s;ted in drawing the faces of his creditors in caricatura. It was ju&s;t &s;o with Parnell. From many of his unpubli&s;hed pieces which I have &s;een, and from others that have appeared, it would &s;eem, that &s;carce a bog in his neighbourhood, was left without reproach, <HI>and &s;carce a mountain rear'd its head un&s;ung.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can ea&s;ily,"</Q> &s;ays Pope, in one of his letters, in an&s;wer to a dreary de&s;cription of Parnell's. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can ea&s;ily image to my thoughts the &s;olitary hours of your eremitical life in the moun|tains, from &s;omething parallel to it in my own retirement at Binfield;"</Q> and in another place; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We are both mi&s;erably enough &s;ituated, God knows; but of the two evils, I think the &s;olitudes of the South are to be pre|ferred to the de&s;arts of the We&s;t."</Q> In this manner Pope an&s;wered him in the tone of his own complaints; and the&s;e de&s;criptions of the imagined di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his &s;ituation, &s;erved to give him a temporary relief: they threw off
<PB N="23" REF="27">
the blame from him&s;elf, and laid upon for|tune and accident, a wretchedne&s;s of his own creating.</P>
<P>But though this method of quarrelling in his poems with his &s;ituation &s;erved to relieve him|&s;elf, yet it was not &s;o ea&s;ily endured by the gen|tlemen of the neighbourhood, who did not care to confe&s;s them&s;elves his fellow &s;ufferers. He received many mortifications upon that account among them; for being naturally fond of com|pany, he could not endure to be without even theirs, which however, among his Engli&s;h friends, he pretended to de&s;pi&s;e. In fact, his conduct, in this particular, was rather &s;plendid than wi&s;e; he had either lo&s;t the art to engage, or did not employ his &s;kill, in &s;ecuring tho&s;e more permament, tho' more humble connex|ions, and &s;acrificed for a month or two in England a whole year's happine&s;s by his country fire-&s;ide at home.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="28">
However, what he permitted the world to &s;ee of his life, was elegant and &s;plendid; his fortune (for a poet) was very con&s;iderable, and it may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed he lived to the very extent of it. The fact is, his expences were greater than his income, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or found the e&s;tate &s;omewhat impaired at his de|cea&s;e. As &s;oon as ever he had collected in his annual revenues, he immediately &s;et out for England, to enjoy the company of his deare&s;t friends, and laugh at the more prudent world that were minding bu&s;ine&s;s and gaining money. The friends, to whom, during the latter part of his life, he was chiefly attached, were Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, Jervas, and Gay. Among the&s;e he was particularly happy, his mind was entirely at ea&s;e, and gave a loo&s;e to every harmle&s;s folly that came uppermo&s;t. Indeed it was a &s;ociety, in which, of all others, a wi&s;e man might be mo&s;t &s;ooli&s;h without in|curring any danger or contempt.

<P>When a man is con&s;cious that he does no good him&s;elf, the next thing is to cau&s;e others to do &s;ome. I may claim &s;ome merit this way, in ha&s;tening this te&s;timonial from your friends above-writing: their love to you in|deed wants no &s;pur, their ink wants no pen, their pen wants no hand, their hand wants no heart, and &s;o forth, (after the manner of <HI>Rabelais;</HI> which is betwixt &s;ome meaning
<PB N="30" REF="34">
and no meaning;) and yet it may be &s;aid; when pre&s;ent thought and opportunity is wanting, their pens want ink, their hands want pens, their hearts want hands, &amp;c. till time, place and conveniency, concur to &s;et them a writing, as at pre&s;ent, a &s;ociable meeting, a good dinner, warm fire, and an ea&s;y &s;ituation do, to the joint labour and plea|&s;ure of this epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>Wherein if I &s;hould &s;ay nothing I &s;hould &s;ay much, (much being included in my love) though my love be &s;uch, that if I &s;hould &s;ay much, I &s;hould yet &s;ay nothing, it being (as Cowley &s;ays) equally impo&s;&s;ible either to conceal or to expre&s;s it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>If we regard this letter with a critical eye, we &s;hall find it indifferent enough; if we con|&s;ider it as mere effu&s;ion of friend&s;hip, in which every writer contended in affection, it will ap|pear
<PB N="32" REF="36">
much to the honour of tho&s;e who wrote it. To be mindful of an ab&s;ent friend in the hours of mirth and fea&s;ting, when his com|pany is lea&s;t wanted, &s;hews no &s;light degree of &s;incerity. Yet probably there was &s;till an|other motive for writing thus to him in con|junction. The above-named, together with Swift and Parnell, had &s;ometime before formed them&s;elves into a &s;ociety, called the Scribblerus Club, and I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e they commemorated him thus, as being an ab&s;ent member.</P>
<P>It is pa&s;t a doubt that they wrote many things in conjunction, and Gay u&s;ually held the pen. And yet I don't remember any pro|ductions which were the joint effort of this &s;ociety, as doing it honour. There is &s;ome|thing feeble and queint in all their attempts, as if company repre&s;&s;ed thought, and genius wanted &s;olitude for its bolde&s;t and happie&s;t ex|ertions. Of tho&s;e productions in which Parnell had a principal &s;hare, that of the Origin of the Sciences from the Monkies in Ethiopia, is par|ticularly
<PB N="33" REF="37">
mentioned by Pope him&s;elf, in &s;ome manu&s;cript anecdotes which he left behind him. The Life of Homer al&s;o, prefixed to the tran&s;lation of the Iliad, is written by Parnell and corrected by Pope; and as that great poet a&s;&s;ures us in the &s;ame place, this correction was not effected without great labour. <HI>It is &s;till &s;tiff,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and was written &s;till &s;tiffer, as it is, I verily think it co&s;t me more pains in the correcting, than the writing it would have done.</HI> All this may be ea&s;ily credited; for every thing of Parnell's, that has appeared in pro&s;e, is written in a very aukward inelegant manner. It is true, his productions teem with imagina|tion, and &s;hew great learning, but they want that ea&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s for which his poetry is &s;o much admired, and the language is al&s;o mo&s;t &s;hamefully incorrect. Yet, tho' all this mu&s;t be allowed, Pope &s;hould have taken care not to leave his errors upon record again&s;t him, or put it in the power of envy to tax his friend with faults that do not appear in what he has left to the world. A poet has a right to ex|pect
<PB N="34" REF="38">
the &s;ame &s;ecrecy in his friend as in his confe&s;&s;or; the &s;ins he di&s;covers are not divulg|ed for puni&s;hment but pardon. Indeed Pope is almo&s;t inexcu&s;able in this in&s;tance, as what he &s;eems to condemn in one place, he very much applauds in another. In one of the let|ters from him to Parnell, abovementioned, he treats the Life of Homer with much greater re&s;pect, and &s;eems to &s;ay, that the pro&s;e is ex|cellent in its kind. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed how|ever, that he is by no means incon&s;i&s;tent; what he &s;ays in both places may very ea&s;ily be reconciled to truth, but who can defend his candour and his &s;incerity.</P>
<P>It would be hard, however, to &s;uppo&s;e that there was no real friend&s;hip between the&s;e great men. The benevolence of Parnell's di&s;|po&s;ition remains unimpeached; and Pope, tho' &s;ubject to &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion and envy, yet never mi&s;&s;ed an opportunity of being truly &s;erviceable to him. The commerce between them was carried on to the common intere&s;t of both.
<PB N="35" REF="39">
When Pope had a mi&s;cellany to publi&s;h, he ap|plied to Parnell for poetical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the latter as implicitly &s;ubmitted to him for cor|rection. Thus they mutually advanced each other's intere&s;t or fame, and grew &s;tronger by conjunction. Nor was Pope the only per&s;on to whom Parnell had recour&s;e for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. We learn from Swift's letters to Stella, that he &s;ubmitted his pieces to all his friends, and readily adopted their alterations. Swift, among the number, was very u&s;eful to him in that particular; and care has been taken that the world &s;hould not remain ignorant of the obligation.</P>
<P>But in the connexion of wits, intere&s;t has generally very little &s;hare; they have only plea&s;ure in view, and can &s;eldom find it but among each other. The Scribblerus club, when the members were in town, were &s;eldom a&s;un|der, and they often made excur&s;ions together into the country, and generally on foot. Swift was u&s;ually the butt of the company, and if a
<PB N="36" REF="40">
trick was played, he was always the &s;ufferer. The whole party once agreed to walk down to the hou&s;e of Lord B&mdash;, who is &s;till living, and who&s;e &s;eat is about twelve miles from town. As every one agreed to make the be&s;t of his way, Swift, who was remarkable for walking, &s;oon left all the re&s;t behind him, fully re&s;olved, upon his arrival, to chu&s;e the very be&s;t bed for him&s;elf, for that was his cu&s;tom. In the mean time Parnell was de|termined to prevent his intentions, and taking hor&s;e, arrived at Lord B&mdash;'s, by another way, long before him. Having apprized his lord&s;hip of Swift's de&s;ign, it was re&s;olved at any rate to keep him out of the hou&s;e, but how to effect this was the que&s;tion. Swift never had the &s;mall-pox, and was very much afraid of catching it: as &s;oon therefore as he appear|ed &s;triding along at &s;ome di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, one of his lord&s;hip's &s;ervants was di&s;|patched, to inform him, that the &s;mall-pox was then making great ravages in the family, but that there was a &s;ummer-hou&s;e with a
<PB N="37" REF="41">
field-bed at his &s;ervice, at the end of the gar|den. There the di&s;appointed Dean was obliged to retire, and take a cold &s;upper that was &s;ent out to him, while the re&s;t were fea&s;t|ing within. However, at la&s;t, they took com|pa&s;&s;ion on him; and upon his promi&s;ing never to chu&s;e the be&s;t bed again, they permitted him to make one of the company,</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;atisfactory in the&s;e ac|counts of the follies of the wi&s;e, they give a natural air to the picture, and reconcile us to our own. There have been few poetical &s;o|cieties, more talked of, or productive of a greater variety of whim&s;ical conceits than this of the Scriblerus club, but how long it la&s;ted I cannot exactly determine. The whole of Par|nell's poetical exi&s;tence was not of more than eight or ten years continuance; his fir&s;t excur|&s;ions to England began about the year 1706, and he died in the year 1718, &s;o that it is pro|bable the club began with him, and his death ended the connexion. Indeed the fe&s;tivity of
<PB N="38" REF="42">
his conver&s;ation, the benevolence of his heart, and the genero&s;ity of his temper, were qualities that might &s;erve to cement any &s;ociety, and that could hardly be replaced when he was taken away. During the two or three la&s;t years of his life, he was more fond of com|pany than ever, and could &s;carce bear to be alone. The death of his wife, it is &s;aid, was a lo&s;s to him that he was unable to &s;upport or recover. From that time he could never ven|ture to court the mu&s;e in &s;olitude. where he was &s;ure to find the image of her who fir&s;t in|&s;pired his attempts. He began therefore to throw him&s;elf into every company, and to &s;eek from wine, if not relief, at lea&s;t in&s;en&s;ibility. Tho&s;e helps that &s;orrow fir&s;t called in for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, habit &s;oon rendered nece&s;&s;ary, and he died before his fortieth year, in &s;ome mea&s;ure a martyr to conjugal fidelity.</P>
<P>Thus in the &s;pace of a very few years, Parnell attained a &s;hare of fame, equal to what mo&s;t of his cotemporaries were a long life in
<PB N="39" REF="43">
acquiring. He is only to be con&s;idered as a poet, and the univer&s;al e&s;teem in which his poems are held, and the reiterated plea&s;ure they give in the peru&s;al, are a &s;ufficient te&s;t of their merit. He appears to me to be the la&s;t of that great &s;chool that had modelled it&s;elf upon the ancients, and taught Engli&s;h poetry to re&s;emble what the generality of mankind have allowed to excel. A &s;tudious and correct ob&s;erver of antiquity, he &s;et him&s;elf to con|&s;ider nature with the lights it lent him, and he found that the more aid he borrowed from the one, the more delightfully he re&s;embled the other. To copy nature is a ta&s;k the mo&s;t bungling workman is able to execute; to &s;elect &s;uch parts as contribute to delight, is re&s;erved only for tho&s;e whom accident has ble&s;t with uncommon talents, or &s;uch as have read the ancients with indefatigable indu&s;try. Parnell is ever happy in the &s;election of his images, and &s;crupulou&s;ly careful in the choice of his &s;ubjects. His productions bear no re&s;emblance to tho&s;e tawdry things, which it has for &s;ome
<PB N="40" REF="44">
time been the fa&s;hion to admire; in writing which the poet &s;its down without any plan, and heaps up &s;plendid images without any &s;e|lection; where the reader grows dizzy with prai&s;e and admiration, and yet &s;oon grows weary, he can &s;carce tell why. Our poet, on the contrary, gives out his beauties with a more &s;paring hand; he is &s;till carrying his reader forward, and ju&s;t gives him refre&s;hment &s;uffi|cient to &s;upport him to his journey's end. At the end of his cour&s;e the reader regrets that his way has been &s;o &s;hort, he wonders that it gave him &s;o little trouble, and &s;o re&s;olves to go the journey over again.</P>
<P>His poetical language is not le&s;s correct than his &s;ubjects are plea&s;ing. He found it at that period, in which it was brought to its highe&s;t pitch of refinement; and ever &s;ince his time it has been gradually deba&s;ing. It is indeed ama&s;ing, after what has been done by Dryden, Addi&s;on, and Pope, to improve and harmonize our native tongue, that their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould
<PB N="41" REF="45">
have taken &s;o much pains to involve it in pri&s;|tine barbarity. The&s;e mi&s;guided innovators have not been content with re&s;toring antiqua|ted words and phra&s;es, but have indulged them&s;elves in the mo&s;t licentious tran&s;po&s;iti|ons, and the har&s;he&s;t con&s;tructions, vainly imagining, that the more their writings are un|like pro&s;e, the more they re&s;emble poetry. They have adopted a language of their own, and call upon mankind for admiration. All tho&s;e who do not under&s;tand them are &s;ilent, and tho&s;e who make out their meaning, are willing to prai&s;e, to &s;hew they under&s;tand. From the&s;e follies and affectations, the poems of Parnell are entirely free; he has con&s;idered the language of poetry as the language of life, and conveys the warme&s;t thoughts in the &s;imple&s;t expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Parnell has written &s;everal poems be&s;ides the&s;e publi&s;hed by Pope, and &s;ome of them have been made public with very little credit to his reputation. There are &s;till many more
<PB N="42" REF="46">
that have not yet &s;een the light, in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Sir John Parnell his nephew, who from that laudable zeal which he has for his Uncle's reputation, will probably be &s;low in publi&s;hing what he may even &s;u&s;pect will do it injury. Of tho&s;e in the following collection, &s;ome are indifferent, and &s;ome moderately good, but the greater part are excellent. A &s;light &s;tricture on the mo&s;t &s;triking, &s;hall conclude this ac|count, which I have already drawn out to a di&s;proportioned length.</P>
<P><HI>He&s;iod,</HI> or <HI>the Ri&s;e of Woman,</HI> is a very fine illu&s;tration of an hint from He&s;iod. It was one of his earlie&s;t productions, and fir&s;t ap|peared in a mi&s;cellany, publi&s;hed by Ton&s;on.</P>
<P>Of the three &s;ongs that follow, two of them were written upon the lady he afterwards mar|ried; they were the genuine dictates of his pa&s;|&s;ion, but are not excellent in their kind.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="47">
The Anacreontic, beginning with, <HI>When Spring came on with fre&s;h delight,</HI> is taken from a French poet, who&s;e name I forget, and, as far as I am able to judge of the French lan|guage, is better than the original. The Ana|creontic that follows, <HI>Gay Bacchus,</HI> &amp;c. is al&s;o a tran&s;lation of a Latin poem, by Aurelius Au|gurellus, an Italian poet, beginning with
<Q><L><HI>Invitat olim Bacchus ad coenam &s;uos</HI></L>
<L><HI>Comum, Jocum, Cupidinem.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Parnell, when he tran&s;lated it, applied the characters to &s;ome of his friends, and as it was written for their entertainment, it probably gave them more plea&s;ure than it has given the pub|lic in the peru&s;al. It &s;eems to have more &s;pirit than the original; but it is extraordinary that it was publi&s;hed by an original and not as a tran|&s;lation. Pope &s;hould have acknowledged it, as he knew.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="48">
The <HI>Fairy Tale</HI> is inconte&s;tably one of the fine&s;t pieces in any language. The old dialect is not perfectly well pre&s;erved, but that is a very &s;light defect where all the re&s;t is &s;o excellent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pervigilium Veneris,</HI> (which, by the bye, does not belong to Catullus) is very well ver&s;ified, and in general all Parnell's tran&s;lati|ons are excellent. <HI>The Battle of the Frogs and Mice,</HI> which follows, is done as well as the &s;ubject would admit; but there is a defect in the tran&s;lation, which &s;inks it below the ori|ginal, and which it was impo&s;&s;ible to remedy. I mean the names of the combatants, which in the Greek bear a ridiculous allu&s;ion to their natures, have no force to the Engli&s;h reader. A Bacon Eater was a good name for a Mou&s;e, and Pternotractas in Greek, was a very good &s;ounding word, that conveyed that meaning. Puff-cheek would &s;ound odiou&s;ly as a name for a Frog, and yet Phy&s;ignathos does admira|bly well in the original.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="49">
The letter to Mr. Pope is one of the fine&s;t compliments that ever was paid to any poet; the de&s;cription of his &s;ituation at the end of it is very fine, but far from being true. That part of it where he deplores his being far from wit and learning, as being far from Pope, gave particular offence to his friends at home. Mr. Coote, a gentleman in his neighbourhood, who thought that he him&s;elf had wit, was very much di&s;plea&s;ed with Parnell for ca&s;ting his eyes &s;o far off for a learned friend, when he could &s;o conveniently be &s;upplied at home.</P>
<P>The tran&s;lation of a part of the Rape of the Lock into monki&s;h ver&s;e, &s;erves to &s;hew what a ma&s;ter Parnell was of the Latin; a copy of ver&s;es made in this manner, is one of the mo&s;t difficult trifles that can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined. I am a&s;&s;ured that it was written upon the fol|lowing occa&s;ion. Before the Rape of the Lock was yet completed, Pope was reading it to his friend Swift, who &s;at very attentively,
<PB N="46" REF="50">
while Parnell, who happened to be in the hou&s;e, went in and out without &s;eeming to take any notice. However he was very dili|gently employed in li&s;tening, and was able, from the &s;trength of his memory to bring away the whole de&s;cription of the toilet pretty exactly. This he ver&s;ified in the manner now publi&s;hed in his works, and the next day when Pope was reading his poem to &s;ome friends, Parnell in&s;i&s;ted that he had &s;tolen that part of the de&s;cription from an old monki&s;h manu|&s;cript. An old paper with the Latin ver&s;es was &s;oon brought forth, and it was not till after &s;ome time that Pope was delivered from the confu&s;ion which it at fir&s;t produced.</P>
<P>The <HI>Book-Worm</HI> is another unacknowledged tran&s;lation from a Latin poem by Beza. It was the fa&s;hion with the wits of the la&s;t age, to conceal the places from whence they took their hints or their &s;ubjects.

The <HI>Night Piece</HI> on <HI>Death,</HI> de&s;erves every prai&s;e, and I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, with very little amendment, might be made to &s;urpa&s;s all tho&s;e night pieces and church-yard &s;cenes that have &s;ince appeared. But the poem of Parnell's, be&s;t known, and on which his be&s;t reputation is grounded, is the <HI>Hermit.</HI> Pope, &s;peaking of this, in tho&s;e manu&s;cript anecdotes already quoted, &s;ays, <HI>that the poem is very good. The &s;tory,</HI> continues he, <HI>was written originally in Spani&s;h, whence probably Howel had tran&s;lated it into pro&s;e, and in&s;erted it in one of his letters. Addi&s;on liked the &s;cheme, and was not di&s;inclined to come into it.</HI> However this may be, Dr. Henry More, in his Dialogues, has the very &s;ame &s;tory; and I have been informed by &s;ome, that it is originally of Arabian in|vention.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the pro&s;e works of Parnell, I have mentioned them already; his fame is too well grounded for any defects in them to &s;hake it. I will only add, that the Life of

<HI>Zoilus,</HI> was written at the reque&s;t of his friends, and de&s;igned as a &s;atire upon Dennis and Theobald, with whom his club had long been at variance.

<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Mu&s;t own I have long owed you a letter, but you mu&s;t own, you have owed me one a good deal longer. Be&s;ides, I have but two people in the whole kingdom of Ireland to take care of; the Dean and you: but you have &s;everal who complain of your neglect in England. Mr. Gay complains, Mr. Har|court complains, Mr. Jarvas complains, Dr. Arbuthnot complains, my Lord complains; I complain. (Take notice of this figure of iteration, when you make your next &s;ermon) &s;ome &s;ay, you are in deep di&s;content at the
<PB N="49" REF="53">
new turn of affairs; others, that you are &s;o much in the Archbi&s;hop's good graces, that you will not corre&s;pond with any that have &s;een the la&s;t mini&s;try. Some affirm, you have quarrel'd with Pope, (who&s;e friends they ob|&s;erve daily fall from him on account of his &s;atyrical and comical di&s;po&s;ition) others, that you are in&s;inuating your&s;elf into the opinion of the ingenious Mr. What-do-ye-call-him. Some think you are preparing your &s;ermons for the pre&s;s, and others that you will trans|form them into e&s;&s;ays and moral di&s;cour&s;es. But the only excu&s;e, that I will allow, is, your attention to the Life of <HI>Zoilus,</HI> the Frogs already &s;eem to croak for their tran&s;portation to England, and are &s;en&s;ible how much that Doctor is cur&s;ed and hated, who introduced their &s;pecies into your nation; therefore, as you dread the wrath of St. Patrick, &s;end them hither, and rid your kingdom of tho&s;e perni|cious and loquacious Animals.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="54">
I have at length received your poem out of Mr. Addi&s;on's hands; which &s;hall be &s;ent as &s;oon as you order it, and in what manner you &s;hall appoint. I &s;hall in the mean time give Mr. Tooke a packet for you, con&s;i&s;ting of divers merry pieces. Mr. Gay's new Farce, Mr. Burnet's Letter to Mr. Pope, Mr. Pope's Temple of Fame, Mr. Thomas Burnet's Grumbler on Mr. Gay, and the Bi&s;hop of Ail&s;bury's Elegy, written either by Mr. Cary or &s;ome other hand.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Pope is reading a letter, and in the mean time, I make u&s;e of the pen</HI> to te&s;tify my unea|&s;ine&s;s in not hearing from you. I find &s;uc|ce&s;s, even in the mo&s;t trivial things, rai&s;es the indignation of &s;cribblers: for I, for my What-d'-ye-call-it, could neither e&s;cape the fury of Mr. Burnet, or the German Doctor; then where will rage end, when Homer is to be tran&s;lated? Let <HI>Zoilus</HI> ha&s;ten to your friend's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and envious critici&s;m &s;hall be no more. I am in hopes that we may order our
<PB N="51" REF="55">
affairs &s;o as to meet this &s;ummer at the Bath; for Mr. Pope and my&s;elf have thoughts of taking a trip thither. You &s;hall preach, and we will write lampoons; for it is e&s;teemed as great an honour to leave the Bath, for fear of a broken head, as for a Terrae Filius of Ox|ford to be expelled. I have no place at court, therefore, that I may not entirely be without one every where, &s;hew that I have a place in your remembrance;</P>

<P>*I cannot fini&s;h this trifle, without returning my &s;incere&s;t ac|knowledgments to Sir John Parnell, for the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was plea&s;ed to give me, in furni&s;hing me with many materials, when he heard I was about writing the life of his Uncle; as al&s;o to Mr. and Mrs. Hayes, relations of our poet; and to my very good friend Mr. Steevens, who being an ornament to letters him|&s;elf, is very ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t all the attempts of others.</P>
