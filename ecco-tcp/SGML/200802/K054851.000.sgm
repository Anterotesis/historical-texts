<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE pious De&s;igns, and the magnificent Works, of our Ance&s;tors are Themes, on which every Reader of a liberal Curio&s;ity receives Information with Plea|&s;ure. But the following Work is more immediately calculated for the peculiar Convenience of the Traveller; and is principally de&s;igned as a <HI>local Guide</HI> to Strangers, who may be tempted to vi&s;it the curious and entertaining Particulars which it profe&s;&s;es to de|&s;cribe and illu&s;trate.</P>
<P>For the Satisfaction of the Reader it may be nece&s;&s;ary &s;till further to premi&s;e, that our Account is compiled from the be&s;t private Information, from an attentive Examination on the Spot, and from a Variety of Ma|terials relating to the Subject, incidentally di&s;per&s;ed in different Books, which have been carefully collected, and &s;uccinctly dige&s;ted.

<HEAD>THE CITY.</HEAD>
<P>WINCHESTER appears to have been a City of con&s;iderable Note among the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> by whom it was called <HI>Caer Guen,</HI> or the <HI>White City,</HI> from its Situation upon a chalky Soil. Many reputable Hi&s;torians report, that it was founded by <HI>Ludor Rous Hudibras,</HI> 892 Years before the Birth of Chri&s;t. It afterwards became a Roman Station, and probably one of their Cities, as appears from the Di&s;covery of a Pavement of Brick, and Coins of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, found in digging the Foundat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">on of the Royal Palace of <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>Camden</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But. p. 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Ed.

<PB N="6" REF="6">
Saxon Heptarchy the <HI>We&s;t Saxon</HI> Kings re&s;ided in this City; who adorned it with magnificent Churches, and an Epi&s;copal See. King <HI>Ethel&s;tan</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed here &s;ix Mints for the Coinage of Money. The <HI>Dome-boc</HI> of <HI>Alfred</HI> was repo&s;ited in the Cathedral of this City, thence called <HI>Codex Wintonien&s;is;</HI> as was afterwards the pre|&s;ent <HI>Dome&s;day</HI> book of the <HI>Conqueror</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Kennet's Paroch. Ant. pag. 63.</NOTE>. From its fir&s;t Foundation to the la&s;t mentioned Period, it was three Times de&s;troyed by Fire. In the Civil Wars between King <HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Maud</HI> the Empre&s;s, this Place was almo&s;t totally de&s;olated; but the Misfortune was amply repaired by <HI>Ed|ward</HI> III. who fixed here a Staple<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Leland acquaints us, that the Staple Hou&s;es <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"lay from the We&s;t Gate in a back Way to the North Gate."</Q> Itiner. vol. iii. pag. 86, ed. 2.</P></NOTE> for Wool, and Woollen Manufactures<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Camden, ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid to have been fir&s;t fortified with Walls by <HI>Guidorius,</HI> Anno Dom. 179. The pre&s;ent Walls are reported to have been erected by <HI>Mo|leutius Dunwallo,</HI> Anno Dom. 341. On the South and Ea&s;t Sides, for &s;ome Di&s;tance, they remain entire, and many Fragments of them are continued to a con&s;iderable Extent on the North and We&s;t, particularly to the We&s;tward, on which is to be &s;een a Ba&s;tion, called the <HI>Hermit's Tower.</HI> Their Circumference is one Mile and

an Half. There were formerly &s;ix City Gates, the four principal of which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, as does one of the Po&s;terns called the <HI>King's Gate</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland &s;ays that St. Michael's Gate is &s;poken of by an|tient Writers, and conjectures that <HI>King's Gate</HI> was &s;ometimes &s;o called, on account of St. Michael's Church &s;tanding near it.

The vacant Spaces within the Walls, now formed into Gardens, demon&s;trate that the Town has been greatly depopulated.</P>
<P>Near the We&s;t Gate we &s;urvey the Ruins of a &s;trong and &s;tately Ca&s;tle, which according to Tradition was built by King <HI>Arthur</HI> Anno Dom. 523; and was a Place of remarkable Defence in the Reign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> again&s;t who&s;e At|tacks it was bravely maintained by <HI>Maud</HI> the Empre&s;s for a con&s;iderable Time. By a Plan of it drawn Anno Dom. 1630, it appears to have been a quadrangular Structure, with a Tower at each Angle: And by a &s;mall Sketch in <HI>Speed,</HI> Anno Dom. 1614, we di&s;cover, that the En|trance from the We&s;t was over a Bridge thrown

acro&s;s the We&s;tern Fo&s;s, leading to a Gate-way contiguous to the South We&s;t Angle of the Building.

The Chapel of the Ca&s;tle, which was, as at pre&s;ent, originally a detached Building, is &s;till entire, and is a mag|nificent Edifice, con&s;i&s;ting of three Iles, 110 Feet in Length and 55 in Breadth. In this Chapel a famous Cau&s;e concerning the Superiority of

the See of <HI>Canterbury</HI> over that of <HI>York</HI> was tried Anno Dom. 1072, before <HI>Hubert</HI> the Pope's Legate, King <HI>William,</HI> and all the Bi&s;hops and Abbots in <HI>England</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wharton's Angl.

<P>The A&s;&s;izes for the County of <HI>Hants</HI> were ori|ginally kept in this Ca&s;tle; at lea&s;t as early as the Year 1272, as we learn from the <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> An|nali&s;t, who frequently remarks that the Royal Fa|mily quitted their Re&s;idence at this Place to make Room for the Judges; but at pre&s;ent the Chapel, of which I have been ju&s;t &s;peaking, is appropriated to this Purpo&s;e. At the End hangs what is com|monly called King <HI>Arthur's Round Table,</HI> which is 18 Feet in Diameter. It would be needle&s;s to multiply Authorities for a Proof that this Table is of modern Date. However it is of higher Antiquity than it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be: For <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript, Region.</NOTE>, who wrote above two hundred Years ago, relates, that it was &s;hewn to the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. and that at that Time many Marks of its Antiquity had been de&s;troyed, the Names of the Knights having been then ju&s;t written afre&s;h, and the whole Table, with its Ornaments, newly repaired. Turnaments being
<PB N="10" REF="10">
often held at <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> before the Court and Parliament, this Table might probably have been u&s;ed, on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, for entertaining the Combatants; which, on that Account, was pro|perly in&s;cribed with the Names of <HI>Arthur</HI>'s twenty-four Knights; either in Commemora|tion of that Prince, who was the reputed Founder and Patron of Tilts and Turnaments; or be|cau&s;e he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have e&s;tabli&s;hed the&s;e martial Sports at <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI> In later Times the&s;e Exerci&s;es were called <HI>Men&s;a Rotunda</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thom. Wal&s;ing. edit. i. pag. 49. See al&s;o Selden, De Duello, pag. 64. Works, Fol. vol. iii.</NOTE>. The Names of the Knights in&s;cribed on the Table are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e we find in an old Romance concerning King <HI>Arthur</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Called <HI>Morte Arthur,</HI> &amp;c. printed by Caxton, 1484.</NOTE>, viz.

<P>On or near the Site of this Ca&s;tle <HI>Charles</HI> II. Anno Dom. 1683, laid the Foundation of a magnificent Royal Palace, only the Shell of which was fini&s;hed. A Cupola was de&s;igned 30 Feet higher than the Roof, which would have been &s;een at Sea; and a Street was intended leading from the We&s;t End of the Cathedral to the Centre of the Front. The Length of the whole is 328 Feet. A Park was al&s;o projected ten Miles in Circum&s;erence: but the Death of the
<PB N="11" REF="11">
King prevented the Progre&s;s and Execution of this noble Plan. The Palace is at pre&s;ent converted into a commodious Pri&s;on for <HI>French</HI> Pri&s;oners of War.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> contains eight Pari&s;h Churches. It had formerly 45, or more, many of which were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Bi&s;hop <HI>Fox</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. as in&s;ufficient to maintain their re&s;pective Incumbents<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Leland, ut &s;upra, pag. 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a Meadow, called <HI>Denemrch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ead,</HI> be|tween Hyde Abbey and the City Wall, <HI>Guy</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> is &s;aid to have encountered and conquered <HI>Colbrand</HI> the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Giant.

<P>On the oppo&s;ite Hill, called <HI>Catharine</HI> Hill, <HI>Leland</HI> acquaints us, there was a fair Chapel de|dicated to that Saint. It was endowed with Lands, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ut &s;upra, pag. 87.</NOTE>.</P>

The Pro&s;pect from either of the&s;e Hills is very delightful. The City, inter&s;per&s;ed with Trees and Gardens, magnificent Structures and vene|rable Ruins, and the Country con&s;i&s;ting of watered winding Vallies, bordered by Decli|vities of a prodigious Height, gradually ri&s;ing into exten&s;ive Downs bounded by di&s;tant Woods, mu&s;t charm every Lover of romantic or rural beauty.</P>
<P><HI>St. John's Hou&s;e</HI> is appointed for the public Meetings of the Mayor and Aldermen. It has an Ho&s;pital annexed, and is &s;aid to have been founded by <HI>William Lamb,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> 1554. In <HI>Le|land</HI>'s Time it was an Ho&s;pital for the Sick, and in the Chapel was a Statute of St. <HI>Bri&s;tan</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> who probably was the Founder<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ut &s;upra, pag. 85.</NOTE>.

On the North Side of the Cathedral is a decent College founded by Bi&s;hop <HI>Morley,</HI> A.D. 1672, for ten Widows of Clergymen.</P>
<P>The County Ho&s;pital in this City is a magnifi|cent Edifice, the Front of which is 224 Feet in Length. It was opened for Patients at <HI>Michael|mas,</HI> A.D. 1759.

<P>Be&s;ides the College and Cathedral, which will be &s;eparately de&s;cribed, there have been &s;e|veral religious Foundations in this City.

<P>THE College of St. <HI>Mary of Winche&s;ter,</HI> commonly called Winche&s;ter College, is &s;ituated to the South Ea&s;t of the Cathedral, ju&s;t without the City Wall. The Front is extended to the Length of 249 Feet, and con&s;i&s;ts of Offices on the We&s;t Side of the Gateway, and of a Part of the Warden's Lodgings on the Ea&s;t. Under the Gateway, the Tower of which is adorned with a Statue of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> we enter the fir&s;t Court. On the left are the War|den's Lodgings, which are commodious and am|ple. That Part of them which fronts the Garden was erected at the Expence of Warden <HI>Nicholas</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">. the Year 1692. That Part which faces the Street, was rai&s;ed in the Warden&s;hip of Dr. <HI>John Harmar,</HI> as appears by the Initials, J.H. and the Date 1597. The North Front of the &s;econd Quadrangle lo&s;es much of its intended Effect by Means of another Part of the&s;e Lodgings, built A.D. 1613. which runs at right Angles again&s;t it on the left.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="24">
We enter the &s;econd Quadrangle under a &s;tately Tower, called the Middle Gate, adorned with the Statues of the Founder, the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and an Angel. This Court is 96 Feet over. The lower Rooms, on either Side of the Gate|way, and of the whole Ea&s;tern Side of this Court, are the Lodging Rooms of the Scholars; over which are the Apartments of the Fellows. The Stair Ca&s;e adjoining to the North We&s;t Angle, leads to the Apartments of the School|ma&s;ter, which are &s;pacious, and elegantly fur|ni&s;hed. On the We&s;t is the Kitchen, and a con|venient Conduit.</P>
<P>The whole South Side is magnificently formed by the Chapel and Hall. The latter is a noble Gothic Room 63 Feet in Length, and 33 in Breadth; in which the Scholars dine at Twelve, and &s;up at Six. In the uppermo&s;t Window, on the North Side, are the Arms of <HI>England,</HI> and of the Marquis of <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Chapel is equal to mo&s;t, and &s;uperior to many, in our Univer&s;ities; whether we regard its Dimen&s;ions, its Furniture, and the Solemnity which &s;trikes us at our Entrance. It is 102 Feet long, and 33 broad. The Screen, Stalls, and Altar-piece, which is of the <HI>Ionic</HI> Order, were executed in the Warden&s;hip of Dr. <HI>Nicholas</HI> abovementioned. The Altar is adorned with a beautiful Salutation Piece, painted by <HI>Le Moine,</HI>

<P>Contiguous to the College, on the We&s;t, is a &s;pacious quadrangular Building, in which the young Gentlemen not on the Foundation, who are called Commoners, live in a Collegiate Manner, under the Care of the &s;econd Ma&s;ter or U&s;her; a Situation which mu&s;t be acknow|ledged to be far more convenient &s;or the Purpo&s;es of Learning, and good Di&s;cipline, than the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of our great Schools, where the Youth are boarded in the Town, and are at a Di&s;tance from the con&s;tant and immediate In|&s;pection of their proper Governors. On one Side of the Area of this Structure is a commodious Cloy&s;ter. There is al&s;o a noble Hall, 50 Feet in Length, and 30 in Breadth, in which the Commoners dine, and, when ab&s;ent from the School, pur&s;ue their private Studies.</P>
<P>This College was founded by that magnificent Prelate <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wykeham,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Win|che&s;ter,</HI> for one Warden, ten Fellows, one School|ma&s;ter, one U&s;her, three Chaplains, &s;eventy Scholars, three Clerks, and &s;ixteen Chori&s;ters.</P>

The fir&s;t Stone was laid <HI>March</HI> the 26, 1387, at Nine o'Clock in the Morning, near a School in which <HI>Wykeham</HI> when a Boy was educated.

Notwith&s;tanding the po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertions above, concerning <HI>Walkelyne</HI>'s entire Demolition of the old Church, I am per&s;uaded that the low-built Iles at the Ea&s;t End of the Choir, exi&s;ted before the Time of <HI>Walkelyne,</HI> and are a Part of the old Church erected by the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings. This ap|pears from &s;everal demon&s;trative Proofs: For, they are in a more &s;imple and confined Style of Architecture, than any Part of <HI>Walkelyne</HI>'s new Work; and, admitting that <HI>Walkelyne</HI> demoli&s;hed great Part of the old Church, it &s;eems probable that he &s;hould leave that Part of it &s;tanding in which many of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and Bi&s;hops his Predece&s;&s;ors, are confe&s;&s;edly buried. Another Evidence of this Hypothe&s;is are the <HI>Crypts</HI> on which the&s;e low Iles &s;tand to this day; and which, as appears from a Latin Epi&s;tle in Ver&s;e of <HI>Wol&s;tan</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apud Leland.

yet at lea&s;t they point out the original Situation of the Church; and invalidate tho&s;e Te&s;timonies which a&s;&s;ert that <HI>Walkelyne</HI> entirely demoli&s;hed the old Church, and cho&s;e a new Ground-plot for his new Structure.</P>
<P>There is another Circum&s;tance mentioned by <HI>Rudbourne</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 270, 271, apud Whart. Angl. Sacr. vol. i.</NOTE>, which &s;till further corroborates my Suppo&s;ition.

mo&s;t convenient and u&s;eful for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; and they allow the whole Materials of the old Building to be applied to the U&s;e of the new.

As the Church of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> is &s;ituated in low Ground, which, without great Precaution and Expence, affords no very &s;ure Foundation for &s;o weighty a Structure, <HI>Wykeham</HI> thought it &s;afe&s;t to confine him&s;elf to the Plan of the for|mer Building, and to make U&s;e of a Founda|tion already tried, and &s;ubject to no Hazard.

The&s;e Circum&s;tances, in which Stability and Security were very wi&s;ely in the fir&s;t Place con&s;ulted, have been attended however with &s;ome Inconvenience, as it &s;eems owing to them, that this Building has not that Lightne&s;s and Freedom, and that Elegance of Proportion, which might have been expected from <HI>Wykeham</HI>'s known Ta&s;te in Architecture, and from the Style and Manner of his other Works in this Kind; of which we have evident Examples in the Chapels of both his Colleges, e&s;pecially in the We&s;tern Part of that of <HI>New College</HI> in <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> which is remarkably beautiful.

<P>In the Grand Rebellion, the Altar-Screen, ju&s;t mentioned, was artfully protected from the Vio|lence of the Pre&s;byterians, by Means of an ex|temporaneous Wall, or Partition, erected in a parallel Line ju&s;t before it, &s;o as entirely to con|ceal its Beauties from the Ob&s;ervation of the &s;a|crilegious Intruders.

<P>At the Ea&s;t End of the Northern Partition Wall is interred <HI>Stephen Gardiner,</HI> Bi&s;hop of this See, under a Shrine of plain Architecture. He died A.D. 1555. The recumbent Figure of the Bi&s;hop was much injured in the Civil Wars.</P>
<P>Behind the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum</HI> is a traver&s;e Wall, at the Bottom of which we di&s;cern the Entrance into the Vault, where the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings already mentioned were fir&s;t buried. Over it is this In&s;cription.</P>

<P>In the Area, on the Ea&s;t Side of this Wall, is a &s;umptuous and &s;tately Monument, to the Memory of <HI>Henry Beaufort,</HI> Cardinal of St. <HI>Eu|&s;ebius,</HI> and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI> His Effigies is repre&s;ented in the Cardinal's Habit.

the munificent Founder of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College in <HI>Oxford.</HI> He is repre&s;ented on the Tomb in his Epi&s;copal Habit, gra&s;ping his Heart between his Hands. The Roof and Spire Work of the Shrine is perhaps &s;uperior, in Exuberance of Orna|ment, and Height of fini&s;hing, to any Structure of the &s;ame Kind. It was gratefully repaired by <HI>Magdalen</HI> College A.D. 1741. Hedied A.D. 1486.</P>
<P>We&s;tward of this are the Traces of the Effigies of a Bi&s;hop, &s;aid to be St. <HI>Swythun.</HI></P>
<P>Near the&s;e is a Monument, rai&s;ed &s;omewhat higher than the Pavement, &s;aid to be that of <HI>Lucius</HI> the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King. It has no In|&s;cription to illu&s;trate this improbable Conjecture.</P>
<P>At the Bottom of the Steps, on the South Side of the Choir, are two very ancient Monuments; one of which has no In&s;cription, the other be|longs to a Prior of the Convent, who died A.D. 1295, and is thus in&s;cribed.</P>
