<HEAD>A COMPENDIOUS <HI>HISTORY</HI> OF THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>WHO fir&s;t publi&s;hed the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t in North Britain, we know not. But, from our ance&s;tors zealous attachment to ob&s;erve their Ea&s;ter upon the 14th day of the moon, we are tempt|ed to think, that &s;ome of their fir&s;t preachers had come from the <HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia,</HI> after that &s;uper&s;tition had become fa&s;hionable there. It is &s;aid, that about A. D. 203, King Donald I. and his queen, with &s;e|veral of his nobles, embraced the Chri&s;tian religion; and that Cratilinth, about &s;eventy years after, more fully e&s;tabli&s;hed it, and aboli&s;hed heatheni&s;m.&mdash;Pro|bably the terrible per&s;ecution rai&s;ed by Diocletian, the Roman emperor, about A. D. 302, obliged both preachers and other Chri&s;tians, in the &s;outh parts of the i&s;land, to flee northward, where his power could not reach them.&mdash;Palladius, coming from Rome, in the 5th century, to a&s;&s;i&s;t out preachers in their op|po&s;ition to the Pelagian here&s;y, is &s;aid to have intro|duced dioce&s;an prelacy; and to have &s;ent St. Patrick from near Gla&s;gow to Ireland, in order to chri&s;tia|nize the inhabitants, or to introduce bi&s;hops among them. But &s;o incon&s;iderable was the power of the&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="6">
primary bi&s;hops, that it was not till about &s;ix hun|dred years afterward, that they had any fixed dio|ce&s;es in Scotland. About this time, Hildebert, Se|dulius, Columba, and other learned men, flouri&s;hed here, and were encouraged by Congall out king. And in this, or the next century, Kintogern, Bal|dred, Conval, Mornan, Cormack, Hebred, Du&s;tan, Jonas, Gabrian, Gall, and Columban, were famed preachers. The two la&s;t travelled into France and Switzerland, if not al&s;o into part of Italy.</P>
<P>About A. D. 520, the Saturnalian fe&s;tivals of the heathens, which had in other places been before tran&s;|ferred to the pretended honour of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were introduced into Scotland, and &s;till continue to be ob|&s;erved in our revels of Chri&s;tma&s;s and the new year, under pretence of honouring the birth and circum|ci&s;ion of our Saviours. In the 7th century, Thomian, Columban, Chroman, Bathan, Herman, Lau&s;tran, Stellan, Sergan, Corman, Aidan, Finan, Colman, A|daman, Chilian, Wiro, Plechelm, Sam&s;on, and Cle|mens, made a re&s;pectable figure in the clerical order. But mo&s;t of them were terribly harra&s;&s;ed by Augu&s;tin, Wilfrid, Boniface, and other Pontifical mi&s;&s;ionaries from Rome, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to &s;ubject their con|&s;ciences or country to his Papal Maje&s;ty, and oppo&s;ed the ob&s;ervation of Ea&s;ter on the day appointed at Rome, as well as the impo&s;ition of celibacy on the clergy, and of their &s;having of their heads in the form of a cro&s;s, to mark their mi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t. In the 8th cen|tury, we find a con&s;iderable number of learned men, of whom John of Air, Alcuin, Clemens, and Raban, favourites of Charles the Great of Germany and France, appear to have been the chief; but whether they were all natives of Scotland, I know not.</P>
<P>About A. D. 860, a Synod held at Scoon enacted, That all clergymen &s;hould re&s;ide at their charges; in&s;truct their people by their example, as well as by their doctrine; that they &s;hould keep no hawks or hounds for hunting; that they &s;hould neither carry warlike weapons, nor plead any civil cau&s;es. Con|&s;tantine,
<PB N="7" REF="7">
the king, al&s;o enacted, That drunkenne&s;s &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death; and that none &s;hould take above one meal a-day, or accu&s;tom them&s;elves to ly on &s;oft beds. About A. D. 904, King Grego|ry, in a convention of &s;tates at Forfar, is &s;aid to have exempted the clergy from all taxes, &s;ervice in war, or &s;ubjection to civil courts;&mdash;and to have given them power to draw tithes, enact eccle&s;ia&s;tical ca|nons, and judge of matrimonial and te&s;tamentary cau&s;es. It was moreover enacted, that every king, at his coronation, &s;hould &s;wear to maintain all the clerical privileges. About A. D. 977, Beornel, or Bernet, a Scotch bi&s;hop, and others, were &s;ummon|ed to England, to have their heretical principle of the lawfulne&s;s of prie&s;ts marriage di&s;proved and con|demned. Dun&s;tan, bi&s;hop of Canterbury, their prin|cipal opponent, by cau&s;ing the beams of the floor, on which they &s;at, to be &s;ecretly cut, that it might &s;ink under every one but him&s;elf, pretended, that their fall, while he remained &s;afe, plainly marked the deci&s;ion of heaven in his favours. About the beginning of the <HI>eleventh</HI> century, King Malcolm fix|ed the bi&s;hops to particular dioce&s;es, and erected the bi&s;hoprics of St. Andrews, Gla&s;gow, Murray, Caith|ne&s;s, Murthlack, and Aberdeen. Turgot was the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of St. Andrews. In this century, Ma|rian, Patern, Amichad, Sigebert, and Elias, Scotch, preachers, made a re&s;pectable figure in Germany. Kings began to be anointed at their in&s;talment. A|bout A. D. 1198, King Alexander, &s;u&s;pecting the intru&s;ive ambition of Thur&s;tan, archbi&s;hop of York, de&s;ired Radolf of Canterbury to provide a bi&s;hop for St. Andrews: and notwith&s;tanding all that Thur&s;tan could do to oppo&s;e it, one Eadmer was &s;ent. But he, refu&s;ing to profe&s;s his &s;ubjection to the Canter|burian &s;ee, was &s;oon obliged to return to England.</P>
<P>In the 12th century, kings and others appeared madly intent on promoting Monki&s;h devotion. The abbeys of Scoon, St. Columbe, Jedburgh, Kel&s;o, Melro&s;s, Newbottle, Holyroodhou&s;e, Kinlo&s;s, Cam|bu&s;kenneth,
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Dundrennan, Holm and Coultram, and two convents at Newca&s;tle; and one at Berwick, and another at Carli&s;le for Nuns, were built, and endowed with revenues mo&s;tly by King David, who al&s;o erected the bi&s;hoprics of Ro&s;s, Brichen, Dun|keld, and Dunblain, and was rewarded with the ho|nour of a Papal <HI>Saint.</HI> His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors founded the abbies of Cowpar, Angus, Sawtry, Aberbrothick, Balmerino, and the convent of Maxwel. The prior of St. Andrews, Richard a canon, and David a pre&s;|byter, were the mo&s;t noted for learning. The Scotch clergy, being cited to a council at Northampton, boldly refu&s;ed all &s;ubjection to the archbi&s;hop of York. Gilbert, a young canon, was their principal di&s;putant. The convent of St. Andrews' election of an Engli&s;hman to that &s;ee, occa&s;ioned a furious con|te&s;t between King William and the Pope, who had laid the whole kingdom under an <HI>Interdict</HI> of all reli|gious &s;ervice, had not Scot, the elected bi&s;hop, by his earne&s;t &s;upplications, prevented it.</P>
<P>In the 13th century, the Franci&s;can and Domini|can monks &s;pread them&s;elves into Scotland. King Alexander II. having a&s;&s;i&s;ted the French again&s;t K. John of England, now an ab&s;olute &s;lave and deputy of the Pope, his Holine&s;s laid his whole kingdom un|der an <HI>Interdict.</HI> When his Legate afterward came to declare the nation ab&s;olved from this dreadful cur&s;e, he &s;o terribly oppre&s;&s;ed them, that they were forced to complain of his conduct at Rome. An|other Legate quickly followed, to rai&s;e contributions for carrying on the <HI>holy war</HI> in Canaan. Having &s;pent what he got in debauchery, as he returned, he pretended, that he had been robbed of it. Another Legate was &s;ent from Rome to demand new contri|butions: but king Alexander prohibited him, or any other, on any &s;uch errand, to enter his kingdom. &mdash;Not long after, Ottobon, and afterward Ru&s;tani, were &s;ent to require payment of the Pontifical dues. But as king Alexander III. prohibited the rai&s;ing of money in his kingdom, without his &s;pecial allowance,
<PB N="9" REF="9">
they dared not to enter the country. In this centu|ry were founded the mona&s;teries of Plu&s;cardy, Beau|ly, and Archattan, the nunneries of Haddington and North Berwick, the abbey of Culro&s;s, and another in Galloway, and the famed cro&s;s of Peebles. Gil|bert, earl of Strathearn, be&s;towed one third of his e&s;tate on the &s;ee of Dunblain, and another on the abbey of Inchaffray.&mdash;From the death of Alexan|der, in A. D. 1285, to the end of the next century, the furious contentions between the BRUCES and BALIOLS for the royal dignity, and the treacherous inva&s;ions and oppre&s;&s;ions of the Engli&s;h, thereby oc|ca&s;ioned, diverted the Scots from their mad &s;uper|&s;tition, and almo&s;t de&s;olated the country. Neither party regarded the Papal mandates of peace, but as they tended to their own intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>In A. D. 1407, Re&s;by, an Engli&s;hman, and in 1431, Paul Craw, a Bohemian, were burnt as here|tics, by order of Henry Wardlaw, bi&s;hop of St. An|drews, who founded an univer&s;ity there, about 1412. Bi&s;hop Kennedy, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, built the college of St. Salvator. Patrick Graham, who &s;ucceeded him in 1466, got him&s;elf declared an <HI>archbi&s;hop,</HI> to whom all the other dioce&s;ans were required to be &s;ubject. But their oppo&s;ition, and the &s;trugglings of Shevez for the office of archdeacon, made him delirious. Shevez, by the Pope's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, obtained the &s;ee. He and Blackater, who was made archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow about 1480, &s;pent their &s;trength in fierce contentions about pre-eminence. Meanwhile, &s;ome Walden&s;es or Wickliffites had taught in the counties of Kyle and Cuningham, <HI>That no images ought to be made or wor&s;hipped; nor relicks of &s;aints adored; that it is not lawful to propagate the Chri&s;tian religion by force; that Chri&s;t gave the power of binding and loo&s;ing to Peter, but not to the bi&s;hops of Rome as his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: that Chri&s;t appointed no clerical con&s;ecrations; that the bread and wine in the Lord's &s;upper retain their origi|nal &s;ub&s;tance after their con&s;ecration; that no tithes ought to be paid to the clergy; that every believer in
<PB N="10" REF="10">
Chri&s;t is a prie&s;t; that the Pope is not the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Peter, unle&s;s in his Satanical hinderance of Chri&s;t's work; that he deceives the people with his Bulls and Indulgences; that ma&s;&s;es are of no u&s;e to &s;ouls in Purgatory: that clerical benedictions are of no value; that the Pope &s;ets him&s;elf above and again&s;t God; that he cannot remit the pains of Purgatory; that clerical excommunications are not to be feared; that it is never lawful for Chri&s;tians to &s;wear: that true Chri&s;tians every day feed upon the body of Chri&s;t:</HI> For &s;preading of the&s;e opinions, perhaps partly mi&s;repre&s;ented by their enemies, about thirty per&s;ons were &s;ummoned before the privy council. But they an&s;wered with &s;uch confidence and &s;trength of rea&s;oning, that it was thought &s;afe&s;t to di&s;mi&s;s them.</P>
<P>While king James IV's brother, and ba&s;tard &s;on were archbi&s;hops of St. Andrews, things went on pretty quietly. But after the death of the la&s;t, a furious contention for that wealthy &s;ee, between Douglas of Dunkeld, Forman of Murray, and Hep|burn prior of St. Andrews, took place. At la&s;t, Douglas yielded, and Forman obtained it, on con|dition of his paying a life rent of 3000 crowns to Hepburn. Meanwhile, or afterward, the learned doctors of the univer&s;ity were bu&s;ied in di&s;puting, Whether the Lord's prayer might be addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;aints! Pretended relicks being in great repute, a Romi&s;h pedlar, who had a large &s;tock of them, o|pened his pack near Haddington. Among other ra|rities, he pre&s;ented a bell which had a rent in it, &s;aid to have been occa&s;ioned by a fal&s;e oath; and pretend|ed, that &s;uch was its &s;acred &s;en&s;ibility, that if any per&s;on with his hand on it, dared to &s;wear fal&s;hood, it would rend, and the &s;wearer's hand cleave to it; but, if nothing but truth was &s;worn, it would not rend, or the &s;wearer's hand &s;tick to it. One Fermor, a &s;en&s;ible man, bent upon expo&s;ing this pretence, begged allowance to &s;wear with his hand on this bell; and holding it up to the multitude, that they might &s;ee in what condition it and his hand were, he laid
<PB N="11" REF="11">
his hand upon it, and &s;olemnly &s;wore, <HI>That the Pope was Antichri&s;t, and his cardinals, archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts, and monks, locu&s;ts come from hell to delude men from God, and that they would return to hell.</HI> Li&s;ting his hand freely from the bell, he held it up to the multi|tude, that they might &s;ee that no change had been made upon it; and that, according to its owner, he had &s;worn nothing but the truth. The pedlar &s;lipt off a&s;hamed, nor did any more of his &s;ort trouble the nation.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, about A. D. 1528, Patrick Hamilton, abbot of Ferm, having in Germany drunk in con&s;i|derable knowledge of the truth from Luther, Me|lancthon, Lambert, and others, he, on his return, communicated it to his friends. He was accu&s;ed of maintaining <HI>That men's &s;inful corruption of nature re|mained after their bapti&s;m; that no man can, by the power of his own free will, perform any thing &s;piritu|ally good; that no man is without &s;in in this life; that every true Chri&s;tian may know him&s;elf to be &s;uch; that men are not ju&s;tified by good works, but by faith only; that good works do not make a man good, but a man be|ing made good by God's Spirit, performs good works; that evil works repented of do not make a man bad; that faith, hope, and charity are in&s;eparably connected; that without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's gracious influence we can do nothing but &s;in: that it is devili&s;h doctrine to a&s;&s;ert, that men's actual penance can purcha&s;e God's pardon of their &s;in; that auricular confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; that there is no Purgatory; that the Old Te&s;tament &s;aints were in heaven before Chri&s;t's death; that the Pope is Antichri&s;t, and hath no more power than any ordinary prie&s;t.</HI> He maintained before their court, that the fir&s;t &s;even of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions were certainly true, and that he could not condemn the &s;even la&s;t, till he &s;aw better rea&s;on than ever he had done. He was therefore condemned to be burnt. While he was in the flames, Friar Campbel and &s;ome others plagued him with intreaties to recant. He &s;olemnly &s;ummoned Campbel &s;peedily to an&s;wer at
<PB N="12" REF="12">
God's tribunal for his conduct &s;o contrary to his own con&s;cience. Campbel &s;oon after died mi&s;erably, frantic and de&s;perate. Mr. Hamilton's brother James and his &s;i&s;ter Katharine, were al&s;o pro&s;ecuted for he|retics: but king James &s;ecretly conveyed them out of the way.</P>
<P>While Boethius, principal of the college of Aber|deen, and Mair, profe&s;&s;or of divinity, and afterward provo&s;t of that of St. Andrews, by their Latin hi&s;to|ries of their nations encouraged others to the &s;tudy of learning, the burning of Hamilton rou&s;ed multi|tudes to examine whether his principles were truth or error, and found them &s;upported by &s;cripture. Friar Seaton taught, <HI>That the law of God is the only rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s; that no man can &s;atisfy for his own &s;in; that pardon of it is only obtained by true faith in the merits of Chri&s;t and an unfeigned repentance; that the &s;cripture requires bi&s;hops to preach the go&s;pel.</HI> Being per&s;ecuted by his &s;uperiors, he fled into Eng|land. Gavin Loggy and William Airth began to perceive the truth, and in their &s;ermons to expo&s;e the wickedne&s;s of the clergy. Henry Forre&s;t of Lin|lithgow, a &s;imple prie&s;t, who u&s;ed an Engli&s;h New Te&s;tament, having been decoyed by his Confe&s;&s;or to acknowledge, that he thought Mr. Hamilton a good man, and his articles defen&s;ible, he was treacherou&s;|ly di&s;covered, impri&s;oned, and burnt. Several were pro&s;ecuted for here&s;y, but recanted. David Straiton, who had been converted from a mo&s;t furious and turbulent profligate, and Norman Gourlay, were condemned to the flames for their denial of Purga|tory, and of the Pope's juri&s;diction in Scotland. Ale&s;&s;e, Fife, M'Dougal, and M'Bee compeared not, but fled into England. After the death of lord Cromwel, the fir&s;t three retired thence into Saxony; and at la&s;t Fife returned to Scotland. M'Bee retired to Denmark, and was remarkably u&s;eful in promot|ing the reformation of that country. In 1538, Kil|lore, Belfrage, friars, Sim&s;on, a prie&s;t, Forrat, a ca|non,
<PB N="13" REF="13">
and R. Forre&s;ter, were burnt for heretics. The bi&s;hop of Dunkeld had warned Forrat, that his preaching every Sabbath rendered him &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y, and advi&s;ed him never to preach on the e|pi&s;tle or go&s;pel of the day, but when it was a good one; and thanked his Maker, that he had lived well many years, without knowing either Old or New Te&s;tament.

<P>James Beaton, archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, dying, his nephew, the Cardinal, &s;ucceeded him. He im|mediately commenced a pro&s;ecution again&s;t Sir John Borthwick for holding, <HI>That the Pope had no greater authority than other bi&s;hops; that his indulgences and remi&s;&s;ions but deceived the people; that clergymen might lawfully marry; that the reformed principles, wor&s;hip, and government embraced in England, were commen|dable; that clergymen ought not to po&s;&s;e&s;s temporalities, but kings &s;hould convert ecele&s;ia&s;tical revenues to other pious u&s;es; that the canon law can be of no force, becau&s;e it is contrary to the law of God; that the friars and monks ought to be aboli&s;hed; that the Pope was guilty of &s;imony, in his &s;elling of &s;piritual things:</HI>&mdash;as al&s;o for refu&s;ing to acknowledge the Pope's authority, and for reading and di&s;tributing copies of the Engli&s;h New Te&s;tament, and other heretical books. But to &s;ave him&s;elf from the frames, Sir John e&s;caped in|to England.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII. of England, having &s;ent to his nephew, king James V. &s;ome books of the Eng|li&s;h Reformers for his illumination, and &s;olicited a friendly meeting with him at York, in order to ad|vi&s;e him to a &s;imilar reformation of religion in Scot|land, the Scotch clergy, dreading the mo&s;t fatal con|&s;equences to them&s;elves, warmly remon&s;trated to James, how inoffen&s;ive &s;uch an interview with his heretical uncle, would be to his Holine&s;s and all good men; and how dangerous to him&s;elf. They pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="14" REF="14">
him an yearly compliment of 50,000 crowns, and in&s;i&s;ted, that, by confi&s;cating the e&s;tates of &s;uch noblemen, as were guilty of herefy and rebellion, he might rai&s;e 100,000 more. Per&s;uaded by their &s;oli|citations, he declared war again&s;t his uncle. Some terrible vi&s;ions, and the death of his two &s;ons in one day, were thought to be warnings from God again&s;t proceeding in this war.&mdash;He had no &s;ooner heard of the defeat and &s;hameful rout of his army of 10,000, who, under Oliver Sinclair, had marched into Eng|land, by about four or five hundred undi&s;ciplined pea&s;ants, than he died of grief, A. D. 1542. Not long after, the Committee of E&s;tates allowed the na|tion to read the Engli&s;h bible, till the bi&s;hops &s;hould publi&s;h a better. But cardinal Beaton, having got a te&s;tament forged for the late king, which declared him&s;elf the principal Regent of the kingdom, for Mary the royal infant; and having got out of pri|&s;on, and even decoyed Hamilton, earl of Arran, in|to his views, he commenced a furious per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tant heretics, particularly in Perth. Some were executed, others bani&s;hed, and lord Ruthven deprived of his provo&s;t&s;hip. In Angus many were pro&s;ecuted for reading the New Te&s;tament, which was pretended to have been forged by Luther. Some were executed for refu&s;ing to pray to the Virgin Ma|ry; and five, on &s;u&s;picion that they had eaten a goo&s;e on <HI>Friday.</HI></P>
<P>In 1544, George Wi&s;hart, a native of Mearns, began to preach the go&s;pel, e&s;pecially at Montro&s;e and Dundee. Beaton drove him from the latter, but not till he had warned the inhabitants, that God would &s;peedily puni&s;h their contempt of the go&s;pel. To the inexpre&s;&s;ible vexation of the archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, Wi&s;hart, with great zeal, and no incon&s;i|derable &s;ucce&s;s, retired to the we&s;t of Scotland, and there preached the glad tidings of &s;alvation. Being informed there, that on the 4th day after he had left Dundee, the plague had broken out among the inhabitants, he ha&s;tened back to them with the of|fers
<PB N="15" REF="15">
of mercy, in the mid&s;t of their di&s;tre&s;s. He &s;oon afterward preached at Haddington, and ob&s;erv|ing, that though thou&s;ands attended a &s;tage play, yet &s;carce an hundred attended his &s;ermons, he de|nounced the vengeance of God again&s;t the inhabi|tants; which &s;oon after overtook them by means of the French and Engli&s;h in the fiege and defence of the place. After &s;everal narrow e&s;capes, he was ap|prehended at Ormi&s;ton in Ea&s;t Lothian. Contrary to the &s;olemn promi&s;e of Bothwel his apprehender, he was at la&s;t delivered up to Cardinal Beaton, carri|ed to St. Andrews, and there condemned to be burnt. After he had received the Lord's &s;upper in his pri&s;on, together with the captain of the ca&s;tle, he chearfully &s;uffered, foretelling the unhappy death of the Car|dinal, who, from his window, plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the view of his torments;&mdash;as he had formerly done the remarkable illumination of the kingdom with the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>To the great &s;atisfaction of the Popi&s;h clergy, Bea|ton had appointed, that none &s;hould pray for the &s;oul of the heretical Wi&s;hart, under the highe&s;t pains. But not long after, two Le&s;lies, William Kirkaldy, James Melvil, and a few others, &s;urpri&s;ed the Car|dinal in his ca&s;tle, and having killed him, &s;hewed him to the mob from that very window, from which he had glutted his cruel eyes with the burning of Wi&s;h|art. In killing him, James Melvil &s;olemnly prote&s;ted to him, that he bore him no private grudge, but la|boured to avenge his treacherous and horrid murder of that man of God. The con&s;pirators and their friends, to the number of about 140, defended them&s;elves in the ca&s;tle, till they obtained a capitulation. John Rough, an Engli&s;hman, was their preacher in the ca&s;tle, and afterward John Knox, a native of Ea&s;t Lothian, came and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him. They were accu&s;|ed of preaching in the ca&s;tle and town, <HI>That no mor|tal man can be head of the church; that the Pope is Antichri&s;t, and not &s;o much as a member of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical body; that every man is bound to receive the
<PB N="16" REF="16">
religion received from God; that the &s;acraments ought to be admini&s;tered in the manner pre&s;cribed by Chri&s;t, and exemplified by his apo&s;tles; that the Ma&s;s is abo|minable idolatry, and a bla&s;phemous reproach of our Sa|viour's death; that &s;uch bi&s;hops as do not preach are not true ones; that the law of God doth not nece&s;&s;arily ap|propriate the tithes to the clergy.</HI> But as Mair, the provo&s;t of the univer&s;ity and prior of the abbey, fa|voured their tenets, they e&s;caped with an admoniti|on. Rough returned to England, and there, by Bonner's influence, died a martyr in 1557.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their capitulation, the be&s;ieged, judging the Pontifical remi&s;&s;ion obtained for them in|&s;ufficient, refu&s;ed to &s;urrender the ca&s;tle, and were therefore anew be&s;ieged, and at la&s;t obliged to &s;ur|render on the &s;ole condition of having their lives &s;pared. In 1550, Knox, and others of them, who had been put into gallies or pri&s;ons, were liberated in con&s;equence of the remarkable victory of the Eng|li&s;h at Mu&s;&s;elburgh. But no &s;ooner had the Scotch managers obtained peace from the Engli&s;h, than they renewed their per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tants. Adam Wallace, a &s;imple man, being apprehended at Win|ton in Ea&s;t Lothian, was condemned and burnt for teaching his neighbours, and for baptizing his own child for want of a faithful mini&s;ter; and for de|nial of Purgatory; and for maintaining that pray|ers for the dead were &s;uper&s;titious, the Ma&s;s an ido|latrous &s;ervice, and the bread and Wine in the Lord's &s;upper not turned into the body and blood of Chri&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding their hard work in determining how the Lord's prayer &s;hould be directed to God, and how to the &s;aints, the clergy found time to publi&s;h a mo&s;t pitiful explication of it, and of the ten command|ments, which, from its price, was called the <HI>Two-penny faith.</HI></P>
<P>RETURNING from England, on account of the Marian per&s;ecution, there begun, John Willock, and John Knox, along with Harlow an Engli&s;hman,

preached the go&s;pel, and declaimed again&s;t the abo|minations of Popery. The clergy quickly com|menced a proce&s;s again&s;t Knox, and &s;oon after a|gain&s;t the other preachers. But &s;o many of their friends attended them at their trial, and even in the Regent's pre&s;ence threatened to avenge the injury done them on their pro&s;ecutors, as quite di&s;pirited them, and made them glad to de&s;ert the diet. At the reque&s;t of his old congregation there, Knox re|tired to Geneva, and thence directed his Appeal to the Nobles, Gentry, and Commons of Scotland, from the bi&s;hops, who had rai&s;ed a new proce&s;s again&s;t him in his ab&s;ence, and burnt him in effigy. Much about the &s;ame time, he directed his Appeal to a free General Council, and to the Queen Regent and her &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Dury, bi&s;hop of Galloway, and Panther of Ro&s;s, two principal per&s;ecutors, dying as brutes, the burghs of Dundee, Perth, Montro&s;e, Cowpar, St. Andrews, Edinburgh, Stirling, and others;&mdash;not a few of the nobility, the duke of Ca&s;tlerault, now <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the earls of Argyle, Glencairn, Arran, Monteith, Rothes, Mar&s;hal, and Morton; Lord James Stewart, after|ward earl of Murray; the lords Lorn, Ruthven, Lind&s;ay, Ochiltree, Boyd, Gray, Ye&s;ter, and San|quhar; Sir David Lind&s;ay, Sir James Sandilands, and other gentry, with multitudes of the commons of Cuningham, Kyle, Carrick, Angus, Murray, Lo|thian, Fife, and Strathern, in&s;tructed by Knox and other preachers, and by reading the &s;cripture and Chri&s;tian conference, began to dete&s;t the clerical ty|ranny, and to doubt of the lawfulne&s;s of attending Ma&s;s, or offering their children to Popi&s;h bapti&s;m, or of a&s;&s;i&s;ting Government in their maintenance of popi&s;h idolatry, or per&s;ecuting men for their adhe|rence to truth; or even of quietly permitting their fellow &s;ubjects to be murdered for the &s;ake of religi|on. They quickly perceived it to be their duty, to make an open confe&s;&s;ion of their faith, and to at|tempt a reformation from the&s;e evils, of which they
<PB N="18" REF="18">
had &s;ecretly complained. Being convinced of their obligation to exert them&s;elves to their utmo&s;t for the aboli&s;hment of idolatry, &s;uper&s;tition, and tyranny, and to promote the pure admini&s;tration of go&s;pel doctrines and wor&s;hip, they re&s;olved to examine their own &s;trength. For this purpo&s;e, while they agreed to hold &s;ocial meetings at &s;et times for prayer and reading of the &s;criptures, till they could be pro|vided with preachers, and Argyle and others took preachers into their families,&mdash;they employed &s;ome of their mo&s;t proper hands, e&s;pecially in Fife and Angus, to travel through the kingdom and &s;olicit the nobility, gentlemen, and burghers, to make an open confe&s;&s;ion of the truth, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t one ano|ther in the defence of it. The&s;e agents appear to have carried about with them <HI>forms</HI> of an <HI>a&s;&s;ociation,</HI> to be &s;ub&s;cribed by &s;uch as inclined. Soon after, they elected ruling elders among them, to whom they promi&s;ed &s;ubjection in the Lord. From their frequent meetings, they began to be called the CON|GREGATION. Laying their account with per&s;ecu|tion from the Popi&s;h clergy and their &s;upporters, &s;everal noblemen and others, in A. D. 1557, enter|ed into a <HI>&s;olemn covenant</HI> to promote the reformati|on of religion, and to defend each other in &s;o doing; which was &s;ub&s;cribed by the earls of Argyle, Glen|cairn, and Morton; lord Lorn, John Er&s;kine of Dun, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Finding, by the return of their copies of a&s;&s;ocia|tion, which they had &s;ent through the kingdom, that their reforming intentions were approven by the mo&s;t of the nation, they appointed Sir James Sandilands to pre&s;ent their reque&s;ts to the queen Regent, and to in&s;i&s;t, that public prayers, and the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, &s;hould be in their own language; that mini&s;ters &s;hould be elected by their people; that the life and doctrine of candi|dates for the holy mini&s;try &s;hould be carefully tried, and all mini&s;ters ignorant or &s;candalous, depo&s;ed, and others, that were &s;it, &s;ub&s;tituted in their &s;tead.

They repre&s;ented to her, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of their open confe&s;&s;ion of their principles, and of their pro|tecting one another again&s;t the cruelty of the Popi&s;h prie&s;ts. In order to procure their con&s;ent to the &s;ettlement of the crown upon the dauphin of France, who had lately married her daughter Mary, the heir of it, the Queen Regent pretended to allow them their public wor&s;hip in their own language, providing, that it &s;hould be performed without any tumults,&mdash;and that their preachers &s;hould not offi|ciate publicly in Edinburgh or Leith.</P>
<P>But, the Earl of Argyle, after much faithful re|&s;i&s;tance of the Archbi&s;hops &s;olicitations, having died, witne&s;&s;ing to the truth, and other well affect|ed noblemen, being removed, probably by poi&s;on, in France,&mdash;the Popi&s;h clergy, provoked by the a|bove conce&s;&s;ions, and &s;ecretly countenanced by the Queen Regent, re&s;umed their courage in 1558, and fell upon Walter Mill an aged prie&s;t. Firmly ad|hering to the truth, he was condemned to the flames, which he endured with remarkable chearfulne&s;s. His &s;peech at the &s;take left a very deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of &s;pectators. They al&s;o procured a &s;entence of outlawry and bani&s;hment again&s;t Paul Methven, who had preached about Dundee and o|ther places of Angus. But, notwith&s;tanding all their malice, the people attended his &s;ermons, and afforded him nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport. At fir&s;t, the Popi&s;h doctors offered a public di&s;putation on the points of difference. But, as the Reformed in&s;i&s;ted, that the <HI>&s;criptures,</HI> not the <HI>canon law,</HI> &s;hould be the &s;tandard of judgment, and that their bani&s;hed brethren &s;hould be allowed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at it, they refu&s;ed to comply with their terms.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of Knox's publi&s;hed appeal from the clerical deci&s;ion again&s;t him, the Lords, and o|ther principal men of the congregation, in&s;i&s;ted, that the laws impowering the bi&s;hops to proceed a|gain&s;t heretics, &s;hould be repealed; that nothing &s;hould be reckoned <HI>here&s;y,</HI> but what was contrary
<PB N="20" REF="20">
to the fundamental doctrines of God's word; and that &s;uch as were pro&s;ecuted for it before civil judg|es, &s;hould be allowed to except again&s;t the witne&s;&s;es, and propo&s;e their own defences, as well as other cri|minals. The Queen Regent kept their petition in her pocket, pretending, that it was not expedient to have it read in parliament, as the clerical members would oppo&s;e her de&s;igns; and that it would be more proper, fir&s;t to procure the favour of the convocati|on. The Lords yielded, for the time: but, before the parliament was di&s;&s;olved, they &s;olemnly prote&s;t|ed, That, &s;ince they could not obtain a ju&s;t refor|mation according to the word of God, it &s;hould be lawful for them to believe and act in matters of re|ligion, as they could an&s;wer to God and their own con&s;cience, till once the Popi&s;h clergy &s;hould prove them&s;elves true mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and purge them|&s;elves of &s;uch crimes, as they were ready to lay to their charge; that no Prote&s;tant &s;hould incur any danger, for non-ob&s;ervance of the laws and rites of the Popi&s;h church; that as they de&s;ired nothing but an orderly reformation of religion, no tumults, occa&s;ioned by the diver&s;ity of religions, or violent reformation of abu&s;es, &s;hould be imputed to them. But, by her fair promi&s;es to remember the&s;e points, and to rectify matters to their &s;atisfaction, the Queen Regent prevented the marking of their prote&s;t in the minutes of Parliament.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;ily fore&s;een, that all application for re|dre&s;s to the Convocation, in which the principal corrupters of religion, and who&s;e carnal intere&s;t was clo&s;ely connected with the corruptions complain|ed of, had the fole &s;way, could be to no purpo&s;e. The Queen Regent, having got her point, relative to the &s;ettlement of the crown on Francis her &s;on-in-law and countryman, &s;ettled, and being offended with the freedom of &s;ome of the Reformed, gave plain hints of her intention to cru&s;h them, and make examples of &s;ome of their chiefs, in order to terrify the re&s;t. Accordingly, in next &s;pring, 1559,
<PB N="21" REF="21">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, requiring all her &s;ubjects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o ob&s;erve the fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter, in the wonted Po|poi&s;h manner. Such mini&s;ters as refu&s;ed compliance, were &s;ummoned before her privy council at Stirling, on the tenth of May. The Reformers &s;ent the earl of Glencairn and Sir Hugh Campbel to &s;olicit her favour to their mini&s;ters, and to put her in mind of her promi&s;es. But &s;he told them in a fury, that in de&s;pite of all their &s;upporters, the&s;e mini&s;ters &s;hould be bani&s;hed from the kingdom, and that the promi|&s;es of princes were not to be urged upon them any further, than con&s;i&s;tent with their own convenience. The commi&s;&s;ioners replied, that if &s;he renounced her promi&s;es to them, they would renounce their &s;ubjection to her; and de&s;ired her &s;eriou&s;ly to pon|der the con&s;equences. Finding that va&s;t multitudes, chiefly from Angus and Mearns, were on their way to attend the mini&s;ters at their trial, and to make an open confe&s;&s;ion of their faith, and being advanced to Perth, had &s;ent John Er&s;kine of Dun to a&s;&s;ure her of their peaceable approach, &s;he, by flattery, and &s;olemnly declaring, that the diet of council again&s;t the mini&s;ters &s;hould be de&s;erted, and nothing done to their prejudice, engaged him to per&s;uade his con|&s;tituents to &s;top, and di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves home|ward. But no &s;ooner had &s;he heard of their return, than &s;he held the meeting of council, and outlawed the mini&s;ters in their ab&s;ence. Highly offended with her <HI>Gui&s;ian</HI> treachery, and &s;ome other attempts to ruin her Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, Er&s;kine po&s;ted to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rth, excu&s;ed his former advice relative to their di&s;per&s;ion, informed them of the Regent's proce|dure again&s;t their mini&s;ters, and warned them to prepare for the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>A multitude of the Reformed quickly rea&s;&s;embled at Perth; and Knox, having ju&s;t returned from Ge|neva, preached a warm di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t the Popi&s;h idolatry. He had &s;carce fini&s;hed it, when a pre|&s;umptuous prie&s;t began to celebrate <HI>high ma&s;s,</HI> and &s;truck a boy, who exclaimed again&s;t his un&s;ufferable

impudence. A tumult immediately en&s;ued, and e|very monument of idolatry in that church was de|&s;troyed. The mob, a&s;&s;embling, fell on the mona|&s;teries, de&s;troyed all the monuments of idolatry they could find, and levelled the buildings almo&s;t with the ground; but permitted the monks to carry off the &s;poil. Not one of the Prote&s;tants took for his own u&s;e the value of a groat. The inhabitants of Cowpar in Fife and other places, &s;erved the monu|ments of idolatry in much the &s;ame manner. In|formed of the&s;e things, the Regent vowed to de|&s;troy every inhabitant of Perth, man, woman, and child, and to burn the town to an heap of a&s;hes and &s;ow the place with &s;alt. She repre&s;ented the Prote&s;tants, as intending nothing but rebellion. To refute her calumnies, the principal Reformers made her a &s;olemn offer of wonted obedience, providing they could have the word of God truly preached to them, and the &s;acraments rightly admini&s;tered. They certified her, that if &s;he did not put a &s;top to her cruelty, they would defend their brethren, take arms again&s;t their enemies, and manife&s;t their inno|cence to Francis and Mary their &s;overeigns, and to other Chri&s;tian princes. They warned her French troops, that if they attacked them, it &s;hould be at their peril. They intreated the Popi&s;h Lords to re|frain their fury till their cau&s;e &s;hould be tried, and they have opportunity to manife&s;t the abominable practices of the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, and the fal&s;ene&s;s of their religion. They warned the Prote&s;tants, that if any of them &s;hould take arms again&s;t their bre|thren, they &s;hould be held traitors to God, and ex|communicated from their &s;ociety. They boldly de|clared, that with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they would de|fend them&s;elves and their brethren again&s;t their e|nemies, though ten times their number. The&s;e re|&s;olute declarations of the ma&s;ter of Lind&s;ay, laird<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Balvaird and Lundy, and &s;ome other barons of Angus and Fife, made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Regent's adherents.

the lawfulne&s;s of per&s;ecuting men, who offered all due obedience to civil authority, and required no|thing but liberty of con&s;cience, and to have their religion tried by the word of God. As the prelates and their clerical agents, to their utmo&s;t, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the &s;pread of their petitions, and inflamed their fel|low &s;ubjects again&s;t them, the Reformers publi&s;hed a declaration, bearing, That if they per&s;evered in &s;uch conduct, and did not mitigate tho&s;e whom they had inflamed, they would apprehend them, where|ever they could find them, and treat them as open enemies to God and man; and that they would make no peace with them, till they &s;hould de&s;i&s;t from their public idolatry and cruel per&s;ecution of God's children.</P>
<P>Informed, that multitudes were marching from the &s;outh we&s;t parts of the kingdom to join this re|&s;olute body,&mdash;and finding, that lord James Stewart prior of St. Andrews, the ba&s;tard brother of Queen Mary, and the earl of Argyle, who had married her ba&s;tard &s;i&s;ter, her commi&s;&s;ioners to the congregation at Perth, were convinced that their Prote&s;tant bre|thren had been fal&s;ely charged with rebellious inten|tions, the Regent and D' O&s;elle her French general re&s;olved to &s;trike up an agreement with them upon as hard terms as po&s;&s;ible. But the earl of Glencairn, with 2500 of his friends, having, with almo&s;t in|credible expedition, marched over the mountains we&s;tward of Stirling, came up before it was fini&s;hed, and obliged her to grant more advantageous terms, <HI>viz.</HI> That none of the towns, &s;hould be challenged for de&s;troying the monuments of idolatry; that the profe&s;&s;ion and practice of the Prote&s;tant religion &s;hould be freely allowed through the whole king|dom; that no French &s;oldiers &s;hould come within three miles of Perth; and that all other matters &s;hould be left to the determination of the Parlia|ment. But, the Reformers returning to their own homes, the Regent was &s;carcely admitted into Perth, when &s;he changed the magi&s;trates, fined and bani&s;h|ed

many of the inhabitants, and left behind her a guard of Scotch &s;oldiers in French pay.</P>
<P>Before their departure from Perth, the Reformers had <HI>&s;olemnly covenanted</HI> jointly to promote the refor|mation of religion in the nation, and to defend one another in &s;o doing. The earls of Argyle and Glen|cairn, lord James Stewart, Boyd, Ochiltree, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ub|&s;cribed it. Argyle, and lord James Stewart, who had mediated in order to obtain the late treaty, lord Ruthven, the earl of Monteith, and the laird of Tul|libarden, finding that it had been &s;o &s;hamefully vio|lated, de&s;erted the Regent; and the two fir&s;t, with their a&s;&s;i&s;tants, de&s;troyed the monuments of idolatry at St. Andrews, Stirling, Linlithgow, and Edinburgh, and &s;et up the reformed wor&s;hip; and re&s;tored it at Perth. She thought to have cut them off at St. Andrews: but being informed of her de&s;ign, they offered battle to her troops at Cowpar moor. She fled to Dunbar, though her forces were ten to one of their opponents: but being informed, that ma|ny of the Reformers had gone home, &s;he in vain attempted to &s;urpri&s;e the Prote&s;tant lords at Edin|burgh. Neverthele&s;s, as &s;he had the ca&s;tle, and the French troops on her &s;ide, they entered into a new treaty with her, bearing, That no Prote&s;tants &s;hould be mole&s;ted for what innovations they had made, till the parliament &s;hould &s;ettle the&s;e matters, and none of their mini&s;ters be hindered from preaching; that the Popi&s;h idolatry &s;hould not be re&s;tored, where it had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and that no &s;oldiers &s;hould be quartered in Edinburgh. The Reformers would not admit the ma&s;s to be celebrated in that city; but the Regent re&s;tored it at Leith and Holy|rood hou&s;e. The duke of Chatelerault having re|turned to them, and his &s;on the earl of Arran hav|ing joined them, the Prote&s;tant lords again <HI>covenant|ed</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t and defend one another in the mainten|ance of their religion. But the Regent, receiving a reinforcement of French troops, re&s;olved to force them back to the Romi&s;h delu&s;ions. After &s;ome
<PB N="25" REF="25">
mi&s;&s;ives had been exchanged, the war began. The Regent's troops were &s;tationed at Leith, and tho&s;e of the Lords at Edinburgh. The Lords declared her <HI>&s;u&s;pended</HI> from her regency, on account of her habitual di&s;regard of the welfare of her &s;ub|jects, and her oppre&s;&s;ion of them by French troops. But the nece&s;&s;ity of their affairs, and the de&s;er|tion of &s;ome of their party to her, obliged them to retreat to Stirling, in no &s;mall perplexity. Here Knox, in a &s;ermon, &s;harply reproved them, for put|ting their tru&s;t in the duke of Chatelerault and his &s;on, rather than in God, who had formerly enabled them to perform what appeared far beyond their a|bility; and he encouraged them to pray and hope, that he would further interpo&s;e in their favour. They applied to Queen Elizabeth of England for &s;ome a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in men and money. A &s;um of money was &s;ent them; but Bothwel, a friend of the Regent, took it by the way. About eighth thou&s;and Engil&s;h al&s;o came to their aid. The Lords having renewed their mutual covenant, &s;olemnly engaged to concur with them, in expelling the French, whom they be|&s;ieged in Leith, with con&s;iderable lo&s;s on both &s;ides. The French troops, having repul&s;ed the allies, and &s;lain a con&s;iderable number of them, piled up their naked bodies, along the &s;ide of the wall. The Re|gent, from the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, beholding the horrid &s;petacle, was tran&s;ported with joy, and cried, That it was the fine&s;t tape&s;try ever &s;he had &s;een; and wi&s;hed, that all the fields between Leith and the ca&s;tle were adorned in like manner. Not long after, &s;he died of a &s;hameful and loth&s;ome di&s;temper, lamenting the mi&s;ery which &s;he had brought on her &s;ubjects, by employing French troops again&s;t them, and pro|fe&s;&s;ing that &s;he expected &s;alvation only through the blood of Chri&s;t. As &s;he could not obtain Popi&s;h funeral in Scotland, her corp&s;e, after about five months, was tran&s;ported to France.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort truce, a treaty of peace was fini&s;hed in July 1560, between Queen Elizabeth of England,
<PB N="26" REF="26">
and Francis and Mary of Scotland, in which the intere&s;ts of our Reformers were included; and the articles of which were, That Francis and Mary &s;hould never more claim the &s;overeignty of England or Ireland, and &s;hould era&s;e the royal arms of the&s;e kingdoms from all their e&s;cutcheons and hou&s;hold furniture; that the tran&s;actions of the preceeding year &s;hould be buried in oblivion, on both &s;ides; that both French and Engli&s;h forces &s;hould return home with all convenient &s;peed; that Francis and Mary &s;hould make no war without the advice of their privy council and e&s;tates of Parliament; nor any of the Scotch nobility a&s;&s;emble &s;oldiers, in any ca&s;e not allowed by the laws and cu&s;toms of the country, without con&s;ent of their Sovereign and his council; that no foreigners &s;hould be put into places of power or tru&s;t; and that a free parliament &s;hould meet in Augu&s;t next, for &s;ettling the religion and liberties of the kingdom.</P>
<P>After ob&s;erving a &s;olemn thank&s;giving to God for their remarkable deliverance, the Reformers di&s;po&s;|ed of their twelve principal preachers to the be&s;t ad|vantage, John Knox to Edinburgh; Chri&s;topher Goodman to St. Andrews; Adam Herriot to Aber|deen; John Row to Perth; William Chri&s;ti&s;on to Dundee; David Fergu&s;on to Dunfermline; and Paul Methven to Jedburgh; John Spot&s;wood was appointed &s;uperintendent of Lothian and Mer&s;e; John Winram of Fife; John Er&s;kine of Dun of Angus and Mearns; John Willock of Clyd&s;dale and Air, and places adjacent; and John Car&s;wel of Argyle &s;hire and the We&s;tern i&s;les.</P>
<P>The e&s;tates of Parliament a&s;&s;embled Augu&s;t 1560; but as Francis and Mary had not fulfilled their pro|mi&s;e, in &s;ending up a commi&s;&s;ioner to repre&s;ent them in it, there was &s;ome di&s;pute, whether its meeting was lawful and valid. But it was at la&s;t re&s;olved in the affirmative. The Prote&s;tant nobility, gentry, burge&s;&s;es, and others, pre&s;ented a petition, craving, That the corruptions of the Popi&s;h church might be
<PB N="27" REF="27">
condemned and aboli&s;hed, and the wor&s;hip of the primitive church re&s;tored; that the authority of the Pope &s;hould be renounced and prohibited; and the patrimony of the church applied to &s;upport mini|&s;ters, teachers, and the poor. All the&s;e demands were readily granted, except the la&s;t; the nobles, who had &s;eized upon the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues for them&s;elves, being very loth to lo&s;e their prey.&mdash;The mini&s;ters were appointed to draw up a confe&s;&s;ion of that faith, the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of which they re|que&s;ted: for hitherto the Reformers had u&s;ed the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Geneva,</HI> as their eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tandard. Being exhibited to the parliament on the fourth day after, it was approved, without the lea&s;t alteration, and without a contrary vote, except of Athole, Sommervil and Borthwick, who &s;aid, They were re&s;olved to believe as their fathers had done. The ten Popi&s;h clergymen pre&s;ent, who&s;e intere&s;t tempt|ed them to oppo&s;e it, were perfectly &s;ilent, which made the earl of Mar&s;hal in&s;ultingly to &s;ay, that <HI>certainly it contained the very truth of God.</HI>&mdash;The parliament al&s;o aboli&s;hed the Pope's juri&s;diction in this realm, re&s;cinded all acts in favours of idolatry, and appointed, that &s;uch as &s;aid or heard MASS &s;hould be impri&s;oned for the fir&s;t fault, bani&s;hed for the &s;econd, and hanged for the third. But whether this or a &s;ub&s;equent meeting appointed the Prote&s;tant clergy to meet in a General A&s;&s;embly, twice every year, I know not. Sir James Sandilands, a knight of Malta, who had behaved him&s;elf very neutrally in the late broils, was &s;ent over to France with the above mentioned acts, to get them ratified by Francis and Mary: but his me&s;&s;age was treated with the ut|mo&s;t contempt. Neverthele&s;s, the Reformers the le&s;s regreted the want of their ratification, as they had &s;o &s;olemn a warrant for the holding of parlia|ment. Francis' death prevented the execution of Mary's re&s;entment, as well as the ma&s;&s;acre of the Prote&s;tants at Orleans,&mdash;for which her <HI>Gui&s;ian</HI> uncles had got every thing prepared. Both Papi&s;ts and
<PB N="28" REF="28">
Prote&s;tants immediately di&s;patched their commi&s;&s;ion|ers to invite Mary home to her native country; and the contempt &s;he &s;uffered in France, after her hu&s;|band's death, cau&s;ed her gladly to accept the invi|tation, and ha&s;ten her return.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the twelve mini&s;ters above-mentioned, with thirty two ruling elders of note, met in their fir&s;t General A&s;&s;embly, December 20th, 1560, and approved of the di&s;po&s;al of the mini&s;ters, and pre&s;ent|ed a <HI>form</HI> and <HI>order</HI> for the election of &s;uperintend|ents, mini&s;ters, elders, and deacons. As, in their Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, they had &s;carcely touched upon church government and di&s;cipline, and did not fully agree with the Order of Geneva re&s;pecting funeral &s;ermons and &s;et forms of prayer, they appointed Me&s;&s;rs. Knox, Willock, Winram, Spot&s;wood, Row, and Douglas, to draw up a <HI>Form of church govern|ment and di&s;cipline.</HI> They fini&s;hed it in a few weeks, and pre&s;ented it to the privy council about the middle of January 1561, for their ratification. But &s;ome of the members, perceiving that their behaviour was to be more &s;trictly watched, and that it inferred a recovering of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, which they had &s;eized, and required an application of them to pious u&s;es, it could not obtain a judicial ratificati|on. But, in&s;tigated by Knox, the duke of Chatel|rault, the earls of Argyle, Arran, Glencairn, Mar|&s;hal, Morton, and Rothes, and the lords James Stewart, Ye&s;ter, Boyd, Ochiltree, Herreis, and Lind|&s;ay, the ma&s;ters of Maxwel and Lind&s;ay, George Gordon, bi&s;hop of Galloway, Alexander Campbel, dean of Murray, and others, barons, or burge&s;&s;es, &s;ub&s;cribed an extrajudicial approbation of it.</P>
<P>This <HI>fir&s;t book of di&s;cipline</HI> required the aboli&s;h|ment of &s;uper&s;titious days, vows, meats, prayers, and of idolatry and all monuments thereof. It pre&s;cribed the manner of admini&s;tring and receiv|ing bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, and other ordi|nances of public wor&s;hip; the form of in&s;talling mini&s;ters, ruling elders, deacons, &s;uperintendents,
<PB N="29" REF="29">
and readers of the &s;cripture, in the church, and their work; the form of cen&s;uring &s;candalous per|&s;ons; the order of the weekly meetings of mini&s;ters for the joint exerci&s;e of their preaching gifts; the form of celebrating marriages and managing burials; and rules for towns, pari&s;hes, univer&s;ities, church revenues, and reparations of kirks. Our Reformers con&s;idered their &s;uperintendents as a mere temporary expedient for promoting the welfare of their infant church, widely different from dioce&s;an bi&s;hops. They were to be elected by all the kirks within the bounds of their vi&s;itation,&mdash;to be examined, and admitted by the mini&s;ters and neighbouring &s;uperintendents. They were obliged to preach thrice every week, and as much oftener as po&s;&s;ible, and to vi&s;it the &s;everal congregations in their bounds thrice a year, and put every thing to rights. They had no &s;ole power of excommunication or ordination allowed them; but were them&s;elves &s;ubjected to the cen&s;ures of the mini&s;ters of their province or &s;ynod, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of the General A&s;&s;embly, to which they were bound, twice every year, to give an account of their conduct. In the <HI>book of di&s;cipline,</HI> ten or twelve of them were propo&s;ed: but, I &s;uppo&s;e, through want of nece&s;&s;ary &s;alaries to bear their expences, their number never exceeded five. Public readers of the &s;criptures were nece&s;&s;ary in that infant &s;tate of the church, in which not one of an hundred was capable of reading them. Their work was to read &s;ome chapters of the Engli&s;h bible to the peo|ple, e&s;pecially when, as was often the ca&s;e, they had none to preach to them.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the convention of e&s;tates had no inclination to ratify the <HI>book of di&s;cipline,</HI> they ap|pointed the Popi&s;h cloi&s;ters and mona&s;teries to be demoli&s;hed; in con&s;equence of which, many co&s;tly buildings, much eccle&s;ia&s;tical furniture, and even many valuable regi&s;ters and libraries, were de&s;troy|ed. But the Popi&s;h bi&s;hops, abbots, and priors, being allowed to retain much of their wonted re|venues,
<PB N="30" REF="30">
they di&s;po&s;ed of what had been reckoned the property of the church as civil property, to their ba&s;|tards or otherwi&s;e. After the news of king Francis' death, the Popi&s;h clergy and mob of Edinburgh, made &s;ome attempts again&s;t the Prote&s;tant religion, to which the care and courage of the Reformers gave a timely check, &s;o as, for &s;ome months, &s;carce|ly any dur&s;t celebrate ma&s;s, or manife&s;t them&s;elves Papi&s;ts by their manner of wor&s;hip. But, no &s;ooner had Queen Mary returned, in Augu&s;t 1561, than &s;he re&s;tored the <HI>ma&s;s</HI> in her own abbey chapel. High|ly offended, many of the Prote&s;tants declared, that they could not be unconcerned &s;pectators of &s;uch gro&s;s corruption of the wor&s;hip of God, nor would &s;uffer the land again to be defiled therewith in their pre&s;ence. To deter them, Mary i&s;&s;ued forth a <HI>pro|clamation</HI> for protecting her dome&s;tics in their idola|trous devotion. The earl of Arran prote&s;ted, That notwith&s;tanding this proclamation, it &s;hould be held as lawful to puni&s;h her &s;ervants for &s;aying or partak|ing of <HI>ma&s;s</HI> or other idolatrous practices, as if they were murderers. Knox, in his &s;ermons, and other|wi&s;e, boldly declaimed again&s;t the Prote&s;tant cour|tiers, who, contrary to their &s;olemn oath, &s;uffered the idolatry of the ma&s;s to be committed; and add|ed, that one tolerated ma&s;s was more terrible to him than ten thou&s;and armed forces invading the king|dom, as it would provoke God to give them up to ruin. To Mary's face, he boldly averred, That the <HI>ma&s;s</HI> was an idolatrous wor&s;hip; and that Papi&s;ts betook them&s;elves to fire and &s;word, becau&s;e they could not &s;upport their cau&s;e by &s;cripture or rea&s;on. He vindicated his own conduct, and maintained, that if princes furiou&s;ly oppre&s;s and murder their &s;ubjects, they may be re&s;trained and impri&s;oned. Not long after, the town council of Edinburgh enac|ted, That no ob&s;tinate Papi&s;t, ma&s;s-prie&s;t, drunk|ard, fornicator, or adulterer, &s;hould be received in|to their city. In revenge hereof, Mary impri&s;oned the provo&s;t, declared the city free to all her &s;ubjects,
<PB N="31" REF="31">
appointed the council to elect a new provo&s;t, and cau&s;ed her own ma&s;s to be more publicly and pom|pou&s;ly celebrated.</P>
<P>The &s;econd General A&s;&s;embly, meeting in De|cember, Lethington, one of Mary's zealous Prote|&s;tant &s;upporters, gave them &s;ome trouble relative to the lawfulne&s;s of their convention without her allowance, and in oppo&s;ing their &s;upplication of her to procure them a civil ratification of their <HI>book of di&s;cipline.</HI> The A&s;&s;embly &s;u&s;tained them&s;elves im|powered by Je&s;us Chri&s;t as head of his church; nor, for twenty years after, had any commi&s;&s;ioner from the &s;overeign any place in their meetings. In February 1562, the privy council, by an act, a&s;&s;ign|ed two parties of the remaining revenues of the church to the Popi&s;h clergy, and the other third to the Popi&s;h queen, out of which &s;he was to pay &s;ti|pends to the Prote&s;tant mini&s;ters, &s;ome of whom had 100, others 200, and &s;ome 300 marks, a&s;|&s;igned them; which were of the &s;ame value as ten or twelve times as much at pre&s;ent. Knox ob&s;erv|ed, That it boded ill to the church, when the devil had the two fir&s;t parts of her revenues firmly &s;ecur|ed to him, and God had but a poor chance for the <HI>la&s;t third.</HI></P>
<P>In their General A&s;&s;embly, which met in June 1562, the Reformers agreed upon an uniformity in the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, according to the Genevan <HI>book of common order;</HI> and that the life, doctrine, diligence, and faithfulne&s;s of the &s;uperintendents, &s;hould be tried in every a&s;&s;embly. They earne&s;tly petitioned her maje&s;ty to remove the idolatrous ma&s;s out of her family and kingdom, and take care, That adulterers, fornicators, bla&s;phem|ers, and open contemners of God, and his &s;abbaths and &s;acraments, &s;hould be condignly puni&s;hed; that mini&s;ters and poor &s;hould be properly provided for, and kirks duly repaired. Me&s;&s;rs. Knox and Hay were appointed as occa&s;ional &s;uperintendents to vi&s;it the counties of Galloway, Kyle, Carrick, and Cun|ningham.
<PB N="32" REF="32">
In his travels, Knox &s;o effectually re|pre&s;ented the danger of the Prote&s;tant religion from the then prevalence of the Popi&s;h courtiers and their friends, that a great part of the barons and gentry in the three la&s;t mentioned places, entered into a <HI>fifth &s;olemn engagement</HI> to promote the true Prote&s;tant religion, &s;upport their mini&s;ters, and protect each other; which was &s;ub&s;cribed by the earl of Glen|cairn, the lords Boyd, Cathcart, Ochiltree, and about 170, or 180 others. At the next General A&s;&s;embly, in December, Winram &s;uperintendent of Fife, was accu&s;ed of &s;lackne&s;s in his vi&s;itations; and of being addicted to worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, negligent of preaching, ra&s;h in his excommunications, and rigid in his exaction of tithes. Er&s;kine of Angus was ac|cu&s;ed of admitting men to be mini&s;ters, and exhort|ers or probationers, without any due trial; and Po|pi&s;h prie&s;ts, and other wicked or ignorant per&s;ons, to be Readers; and &s;candalous per&s;ons to be ruling elders; and of conniving at mini&s;ters not re&s;iding at their charges, and not duly attending the weekly exerci&s;es of prophe&s;ying or mutual improvement. Methven of Jedburgh was accu&s;ed, depo&s;ed, and excommunicated for uncleanne&s;s with his &s;ervant maid. No doubt, the&s;e blemi&s;hes in three of the twelve reforming mini&s;ters, did, in the awful provi|dence of God, much hurt their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In June 1563, the a&s;&s;embly finding, that the &s;u|perintendents had not been duly laborious and faith|ful, or had too much work on their hands, appoint|ed Knox and &s;ome others, whom they accounted mo&s;t learned and faithful, to vi&s;it particular di&s;tricts, plant churches, promote the de&s;truction of idola|trous monuments, &s;u&s;pend, depo&s;e, and tran&s;plant mini&s;ters, as the &s;uperintendents did, and with the &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance from congregations, &s;ynods, meet|ings for exerci&s;e, or learned men. Such as found them&s;elves injured by their mini&s;ters, elders, or deacons, were allowed to appeal to the &s;uperinten|dents and their &s;ynod, and from the&s;e to the General
<PB N="33" REF="33">
A&s;&s;embly, which, for about 22 years, met once in &s;ix months. They al&s;o appointed the earl of Mar|&s;hal, lord Ruthven, Lethington, and the celebrated George Buchanan, to revi&s;e their <HI>book of di&s;cipline,</HI> in order to procure a parliamentary ratification of it. But they do not appear to have fulfilled their ta&s;k. Lord James Stewart having been advanced to be earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> became much more negligent of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, and of puni&s;hing ma&s;s prie&s;ts, which occa&s;ioned a difference between him and Knox. In a &s;et di&s;pute with the time &s;erving Lethington, Knox and Row boldly maintained, That it was lawful for &s;ubjects to re&s;i&s;t tyrannical princes, and to refu&s;e her maje&s;ty the u&s;e of her idolatrous ma&s;s. Knox was pro&s;ecuted before the privy council for writing &s;ome letters calculated to conveen his Prote&s;tant brethren for con&s;ultation, when he apprehended their religion and liberties were in danger; but, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of Mary and her courtiers to ruin him, he was ac|quitted.</P>

<P>Mary's intentions to extirpate the Prote&s;tant reli|gion, daily became more and more evident. In 1565, Hamilton, ba&s;tard brother of the earl of Arran, was re&s;tored to his dignity and revenues of Archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews. Her pretended kind|ne&s;s and flatteries gained many of the Prote&s;tant chiefs to her intere&s;t. The earl of Murray and &s;ome others were highly offended with Knox and his faithful brethren, for their pulpit declamations a|gain&s;t her Popi&s;h idolatry. In order to obtain their con&s;ent to her marriage with Henry her Popi&s;h cou|&s;in, &s;hw fawned upon the Prote&s;tants, and &s;eemed almo&s;t ready to concur with their articles for the a|boli&s;hment of Popery, and for provi&s;ion to their mini&s;ters, &s;chools and colleges; and for the puni&s;h|ment of horrible crimes. But &s;he had no &s;ooner gained her own purpo&s;e, than &s;he peremptorily told them, That &s;he would never part with her ma&s;s; and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to concur with any laws a|gain&s;t Popery or profanene&s;s, or to allow the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical

<P>Meanwhile, the General A&s;&s;embly had enacted, That no &s;uperintendents &s;hould depo&s;e any mini&s;ter, exhorter, or reader, without the advice of the near|e&s;t di&s;creet mini&s;ters, and no longer than till the fol|lowing A&s;&s;embly, which might re&s;tore, or further cen&s;ure, the offenders, as they thought proper; and that they &s;hould excommunicate no delinquents, in places where there were no reformed congregations, without the advice of &s;uch as were neare&s;t.

They wrote a letter to the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops, in favours of their Puritan brethren, that were per&s;ecuted for their non-compliance with the <HI>&s;urplice, cornered cap,</HI> and other remains of Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition; and al&s;o approved the late&s;t <HI>Helvetian confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> except as to the ob&s;ervation of holy days.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a preceding agreement, many noblemen and barons met in the A&s;&s;embly 1567, between the depo&s;ition of Mary and the coronation of James her &s;on; and agreed, That the acts of 1560, for e&s;tabli&s;hing of the Prote&s;tant religion, and giving the mini&s;ters a third part of the antient be|nefices, ought to be duly executed; and that, in the
<PB N="36" REF="36">
en&s;uing parliament, they &s;hould exert them&s;elves to their utmo&s;t to have the Prote&s;tant religion e&s;tabli&s;h|ed upon a &s;ure footing, and to have every future king bound by his coronation oath to maintain and practi&s;e it, as a condition of his &s;ubjects allegiance to him;&mdash;and to have the Ma&s;s and other relicks of idolatry aboli&s;hed, and the Prote&s;tant religion intro|duced into every part of the realm; and to have the horrid crimes of adultery, whoredom, bla&s;phemy, and the like, duly puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>After the Parliament, which met that year, had confirmed the election of the Earl of Murray to be Regent for James his infant nephew and king, they ratified the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith compiled in 1560, and declared, That all, who &s;hould oppo&s;e it, or refu&s;e to receive the &s;acraments in the Prote&s;tant manner, &s;hould be held as no members of this church. They enacted, That all kings, princes, and magi&s;|trates, at their in&s;talment, &s;hould &s;wear to maintain the true Prote&s;tant religion now e&s;tabli&s;hed, and a|boli&s;h every thing contrary to it,&mdash;and root out all heretics and enemies to the true wor&s;hip of God, when duly convicted: They appointed the <HI>thirds</HI> of eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices to be paid to the reformed mi|ni&s;ters, till the church &s;hould obtain full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the tithes as her proper patrimony; and that, though Patrons may appeal from &s;uperintendents and provincial Synods, the General A&s;&s;embly &s;hall have the final deci&s;ion relative to all pre&s;entations, from which none may appeal. They ordained, that no eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction be acknowledged within this realm, but what is e&s;tabli&s;hed in, and proceeds from this reformed kirk, concerning the preaching of God's word, admini&s;tration of &s;acraments, and cor|rection of manners: They appointed Me&s;&s;rs. Knox, Craig, Er&s;kine, and Spot&s;wood, to mark out what properly belonged to eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, and report to next meeting of Parliament.</P>
<P>Next year, the General A&s;&s;embly appointed Me&s;&s;. Craig, Row, Pont, Chri&s;ti&s;on, Lind&s;ay, and Wil|lock,
<PB N="37" REF="37">
to revi&s;e the <HI>Order of excommunication</HI> draw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> up by Knox, and report their judgment. It was a|greed to, and printed before their P&s;alm book, and plainly &s;hews, That they reckoned their &s;uperinten|dents as merely <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> officers, that had no &s;ole power of any kind. They al&s;o appointed an order of electing commi&s;&s;ioners to their General A&s;&s;em|blies, bearing, That &s;uperintendents and commi&s;&s;io|ners for vi&s;itation of kirks &s;hould all have power of voting in them; that mini&s;ters and commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;hires &s;hould be cho&s;en by Synods; that commi&s;&s;io|ners from burghs &s;hould be cho&s;en by the council and kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place; and that mini&s;ters &s;hould be cho&s;en by turns. After the erection of Pre&s;byte|ries, mini&s;ters were elected by them.</P>
<P>The murder of the Regent, earl of Murray, by Hamilton of Bothwel haugh, occa&s;ioned no &s;mall contention about the choice of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. And the earls of Lennox and Mar filled his place but a|bout two years between them. During the regency of Murray and Lennox, religion pro&s;pered, eccle&s;i|a&s;tical courts enjoyed full freedom in planting of churches and cen&s;uring of offenders, and other parts of their work. In 1570, the General A&s;&s;embly e|&s;tabli&s;hed regulations of their meetings, that (1.) After a &s;ermon by the Moderator of the la&s;t A&s;&s;em|bly, a new Moderator &s;hould be cho&s;en. (2.) The conduct of &s;uperintendents and commi&s;&s;ioners for vi&s;itation of kirks &s;hould be tried. (3.) Penitents and &s;candalous per&s;ons &s;hall have their ca&s;es con&s;ide|red. (4.) Matters referred by the preceding A&s;&s;em|bly, or Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, &s;hall be con&s;idered. (5.) The conduct and accounts of eccle&s;ia&s;tical collectors &s;hall be examined. (6.) Petitions from &s;uperinten|dents, and appeals from Synods, &s;hall be heard. (7.) Que&s;tions propo&s;ed on the fir&s;t or &s;econd days of the meeting, &s;hall be con&s;idered. (8.) And la&s;tly, Bills and complaints &s;hall be judged. The A&s;&s;embly al&s;o enacted, That every candidate for the mini&s;try
<PB N="38" REF="38">
&s;hould, at his admi&s;&s;ion, &s;olemnly engage never to de&s;ert his office under pain of infamy and perjury.</P>
<P>In 1571, the A&s;&s;embly ordained, That all adulte|rers, murderers, ince&s;tuous per&s;ons, and other more heinous offenders, &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted before the provincial &s;ynods, which met twice every year; and that all que&s;tions &s;hould be fir&s;t propo&s;ed to Synods, and only &s;uch as were too hard for them &s;hould be laid before every A&s;&s;embly. Me&s;&s;rs. Knox, Er&s;kine, Winram, Pont, and Row, having drawn up articles concerning the <HI>proper object</HI> of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;dicti|on, bearing, That it belonged to the church to judge of true and fal&s;e religion, doctrine, here&s;y, and eve|ry thing annexed to the preaching of the word, and admini&s;tration of &s;acraments;&mdash;to elect, examine, admit, &s;u&s;pend, or depo&s;e all &s;uch as have charge of &s;ouls, or enjoy eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices;&mdash;to admoni&s;h, rebuke, and excommunicate the &s;candalous, and re|ceive to repentance, and ab&s;olve the penitents;&mdash;to judge of eccle&s;ia&s;tical pleas between church officers, and of cau&s;es relative to marriage and divorce. They approved the&s;e articles, and pre&s;ented them to the Parliament for their ratification, along with a petiti|on, That eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices &s;hould only be con|ferred on &s;uch as the church &s;hould find qualified for the charge. But the earl of Morton, who now managed that court, and &s;ome other lords, abu&s;ed the commi&s;&s;ioners from the A&s;&s;embly with in&s;olent language. Morton even obliged John Douglas, whom he had ju&s;t before pre&s;ented to the archbi&s;ho|prick of St. Andrews, in the room of Hamilton, who had been hanged for a traitor,&mdash;to vote in the Par|liament as a bi&s;hop, under pain of trea&s;on; though the &s;uperintendent had prohibited him to vote, un|der pain of excommunication.</P>
<P>In preferring Douglas to the archbi&s;hoprick, Mor|ton had &s;ecured mo&s;t of the revenues for him&s;elf, and left Douglas little more than a high &s;ounding character, and a chance of &s;ome Antichri&s;tian power. The gain, which Morton made by this infamous bar|gain,
<PB N="39" REF="39">
tempted him and Mar the Regent, a great part of who&s;e e&s;tate con&s;i&s;ted of church property, to en|large their incomes in the &s;ame &s;candalous manner, by preferring to bi&s;hopricks, &s;uch pitiful wretches, as could be content with epi&s;copal titles and &s;hadows of power, and allow their promoters the mo&s;t of the revenues claimed by their &s;ees. The&s;e the people called <HI>tulchan</HI> bi&s;hops, in allu&s;ion to calves &s;kins, &s;tuff|ed with &s;traw, and placed before cows, to make them give their milk &mdash;An occasional meeting of mini&s;ters and others, that u&s;ed to be members of the General A&s;&s;embly, pretended to have the power of it, and marked their &s;trong inclination to comply with that of the two infamous earls. Pont was allowed to be a Lord of Se&s;&s;ion, providing that he continued his mini&s;terial work. Encouraged by their compliances, Mar and his privy council appointed Morton the chancellor, Ruthven the trea&s;urer, Adam nominal bi&s;hop of Orkney, and Robert commendator of Dun|fermline, &s;ecretary, and four others, to meet with the &s;uperintendents or their commi&s;&s;ioners, and a|long with them to conclude a <HI>Form of church policy,</HI> and method of &s;upporting mini&s;ters and the royal dignity,&mdash;which might be binding till his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be of full age, or at lea&s;t till the E&s;tates of Parliament &s;hould aboli&s;h it.</P>
<P>This convention was quickly held at Leith. But it doth not appear, that any mini&s;ters, but Er&s;kine, Winram, Hay, Lind&s;ay, Pont, and Craig, were pre|&s;ent. They agreed, That the titles of archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, deans, and the forms of dioce&s;es, &s;hould be retained as before the Reformation; that a chapter of learned mini&s;ters &s;hould be annexed to every epi&s;|copal &s;ee; that in ca&s;e of a vacancy the dean or pre|&s;ident of this chapter &s;hould exerci&s;e the epi&s;copal power; that bi&s;hops &s;hould have no more power than the &s;uperintendents, till it &s;hould be agreed on; that they &s;hould be &s;ubject to the General A&s;&s;embly in every &s;piritual affair; that they &s;hould admit none to the mini&s;try without the advice of &s;ix of their
<PB N="40" REF="40">
chapter:&mdash;they agreed on the manner of the creation of &s;uch as &s;hould be pre&s;ented by the king to bi&s;ho|pricks; and that every one admitted to eccle&s;ia&s;tical functions or livings, &s;hould &s;wear an adherence to the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and an allegiance to his ma|je&s;ty. They al&s;o made &s;ome rules concerning abbots, priors, or commendators, That they &s;hould be men of learning, and might be Lords of Se&s;&s;ion or mem|bers of Parliament, repre&s;enting the church. They further agreed, That no mini&s;ter &s;hould leave his charge forty days in the year, without expre&s;s licence from the king or his bi&s;hop; that Readers might admini&s;ter bapti&s;m, or celebrate marriage, if it had been duly intimated. They al&s;o enacted &s;ome regu|lations of eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, and of the orders and offices in colleges. The mo&s;t of their agree|ments marked an Antichri&s;tian and carnal mind. Morton took care, that nothing &s;hould be &s;ecured to the clergy, but their tithes, which he knew not how to take from them, unle&s;s in donative pen&s;ions to noblemen's &s;ervants, or by cau&s;ing them to di&s;pone them in fee to their ma&s;ters. Mar, being epi&s;copal|ly inclined, highly approved the above regulations. To the great grief of Knox and others, John Dou|glas, who was remarkable for nothing but compli|ance with the covetous humour of Morton, was &s;o|lemnly admitted archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews. Knox, not only refu&s;ed to con&s;ecrate him, but al&s;o publicly denounced a cur&s;e upon the giver and the receiver of that office. Informed of the&s;e proceedings, Beza of Geneva, begged of Knox and his brethren, to be|ware of re-introducing the plague of Prelacy, which they had thru&s;t out in their reformation. Neverthe|le&s;s, James Boyd was made archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, John Paton bi&s;hop of Dunkeld, and A. Graham of Dunblain. Soon after, we find G. Douglas bi&s;hop of Murray, and &s;ome others,&mdash;of Caithne&s;s, Brichen, I&s;les, Galloway, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the end of this year 1571, died John Knox, our principal Reformer, in a truly humble and Chri&s;|tian
<PB N="41" REF="41">
manner. His zeal for, and tru&s;t in his God, made him fearle&s;s of every thing but &s;in. Morton, who hated him, after his death, atte&s;ted, that he ne|ver feared the face of man. The maje&s;ty of his ma&s;|ter Chri&s;t, appearing in him, made his enemies &s;tand in awe of him. Q. Mary, notwith&s;tanding all her levity and wickedne&s;s, owned, that &s;he was more a|fraid of his prayers, than of ten thou&s;and armed men. He foretold a multitude of unlikely events, which were exactly fulfilled, particularly, That the thick walls of the ca&s;tle of St. Andrews &s;hould prove as egg &s;hells in defence of the con&s;pirators again&s;t car|dinal Beaton; that the Engli&s;h would not deliver them, but they would fall into the hand of their e|nemies, and be carried into a foreign country; that notwith&s;tanding manifold repul&s;es, God would per|fect the reformation of religion in Scotland; that Queen Mary would be compelled to hear the word of God; that &s;ince Henry her hu&s;band had burnt the P&s;alm book to plea&s;e her, God &s;hould &s;trike them both head and tail; and &s;ince he went to Ma&s;s to plea&s;e her, God &s;hould make her the in&s;trument of his de&s;truction; that the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh &s;hould fpue Sir William Kirkaldy over its walls, and he &s;hould be hanged for his ob&s;tinate adherence to the wicked Queen; and that its St. David's tower &s;hould run down like a &s;and gla&s;s; that, if Morton did not &s;tudy to promote the welfare of the church and nati|on, his regency &s;hould have an ignominious end; that Thomas Maitland &s;hould die mi&s;erably among &s;trangers, and Lethington unhappily at home, as the puni&s;hment of their treacherous oppo&s;ition to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Alarmed by the articles of the convention at Leith, the faithful mini&s;ters, notwith&s;tanding all the power and influence of Morton, now Regent, &s;et them|&s;elves to oppo&s;e them. The General A&s;&s;embly 1573, declared it impo&s;&s;ible for any man faithfully to fulfil the work of a mini&s;ter, and of a civil judge; and prohibited every mini&s;ter, after Pont, to accept of a
<PB N="42" REF="42" MS="y">
place in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. The complaints again&s;t Pont for his neglect of vi&s;iting the county of Mur|ray, as he had been appointed, ju&s;tified their con|duct. They likewi&s;e appointed every meeting of the clergy for exerci&s;e of their gifts to have a copy of the acts of a&s;&s;embly; and that every province &s;hould have copies of the orders given to &s;uperintendents that they right ob&s;erve, whether they did faithful|ly execute them or not. After the General A&s;&s;em|blies had, for eight years, laboured in limiting the power of the new bi&s;hops, and in cen&s;uring them for exceeding their bounds, and for their admi&s;&s;ion of ignorant and &s;candalous per&s;ons into eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices, and for their per&s;onal negligence and immo|ralities, they, notwith&s;tanding much oppo&s;ition from Morton, and even from the young king, put them down altogether, as dregs of Popery. And, with much deliberation, formed the <HI>&s;econd book of di&s;cip|line,</HI> and declared, That the office of Readers, Ex|horters, and Vi&s;iters of the church, being but <HI>tem|porary,</HI> &s;hould now cea&s;e. Some of the corruptions complained of, in the eleventh chapter of that book, were &s;oon after aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The French zealots and Spaniards had formed a <HI>&s;acred league</HI> to extirpate the Prote&s;tant religion, and their Popi&s;h brethren in Britain were di&s;po&s;ed to join them; di&s;pen&s;ations had been &s;ent them from Rome, allowing them to enter into any engagement by oath or otherwi&s;e, in favour of the Prote&s;tant religion, providing they continued firm adherents to the Pope and his religion in their heart. King James, now about 14 years of age, under one of his religious fits, or prompted by &s;ome church-men, or by his favourites, Stewart of Aubigne his father's cou&s;in, now made earl of Lennox, and Stewart of Ochiltree, now made earl of Arran, who, about this time, for different ends, profe&s;&s;ed great zeal for the Prote&s;tant religion,&mdash;required John Craig his mini&s;ter, to form a COVENANT or oath, &s;o expre&s;ly pointed again&s;t Popery, that no Papi&s;t, who&s;e con|&s;cience
<PB N="43" REF="43">
was not utterly debauched, might be capable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;wear it. Craig drew up what hath &s;ince been ordinarily called the <HI>national covenant,</HI> which was &s;ub&s;cribed by James and his privy council, the earls of Argyle, Lennox, Bothwel, Ruthven, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ords Ogilvy, Cathcart, James Stewart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the beginning of 1581. James al&s;o appeared extremely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ealous for e&s;tabli&s;hing order in the church, and making provi&s;ion for her clergy. He propo&s;ed, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he 924 pari&s;hes in the kingdom &s;hould be reduced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o 600, and the&s;e cla&s;&s;ed into <HI>fifty</HI> Pre&s;byteries; and that of the&s;e 600 mini&s;ters, 100 &s;hould have 500 marks; 200 of them 300 marks; other 200 of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut 200 marks; and the other 100 about 100 marks Scots, for their yearly &s;tipend; the lea&s;t of which being then an equivalent of 80 bolls of oat-meal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e &s;alaries were not &s;o de&s;picable as we are apt to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">magine, had they not been mi&s;erably paid.</P>
<P>Glad to find the court in &s;uch a temper, the A&s;|&s;embly quickly formed the&s;e pre&s;byteries, and &s;up|plicated his maje&s;ty and council, that there might be a Judge appointed at Edinburgh, to judge of wrongs done to mini&s;ters, and an act of Parliament declaring the particular grounds of the depo&s;ition of clergymen; and that vacant benefices &s;hould be be&s;towed upon &s;uch as mini&s;ter in the church, not upon laymen. They cited the Popi&s;h abbots, com|mendators, priors, priore&s;&s;es, and bi&s;hops, who &s;till enjoyed the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, and were ba&s;ely dilapidating them, to compear before next A&s;&s;em|bly, to an&s;wer for their conduct. Upon his maje&s;|ty's demanding how the third e&s;tate of Parliament was to be now &s;upplied, when bi&s;hops were put down, they agreed, That commi&s;&s;ioners from the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould fill their place. But I do not find, that they intended that the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he clergymen.&mdash;They al&s;o appointed the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which had been lately &s;ub&s;cribed by James and his council, to be &s;ub&s;cribed by all ranks in the kingdom, and that &s;uch &s;hould be cen&s;ured, who refu&s;ed to do
<PB N="44" REF="44">
&s;o. They prohibited all private celebration of bap|ti&s;m or marriage, under pain of depo&s;ition to mini|&s;ters.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Lennox, lately converted from Popery, got rid of Morton his rival, than he laid a&s;ide his religious appearances, and pre&s;ented Mont|gomery, mini&s;ter of Stirling, to the archbi&s;hoprick of Gla&s;gow in the room of Boyd, and got him ad|mitted by force; but &s;ecured for him&s;elf a great part of the epi&s;copal revenues. He, and Adam&s;on of St. Andrews, by their &s;candalous behaviour, and by their fraudulent and violent oppo&s;ition to reforming mea&s;ures, gave their brethren no &s;mall trouble, in their a&s;&s;emblies. Montgomery was excommunicated; but Lennox &s;upported him. Balcanquel, A. Melvin, Dury, and no doubt other faithful mini&s;ters, thun|dered forth their declamations again&s;t the court's en|croachments upon the &s;piritual power of the church. Balcanquel and Melvin were pro&s;ecuted, and Dury was bani&s;hed on that account.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of their trouble with Montgomery, the A&s;&s;embly 1582, under pain of excommunication, prohibited all indirect methods of entering into ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical offices; all a&s;king of pre&s;entations from magi&s;trates or patrons; and all attempts to free them&s;elves from the juri&s;diction and di&s;cipline of the church by appeals to great men, or courting their favour.&mdash;They declared all deprivation from eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices, as well as examination and ad|mi&s;&s;ion to them, to belong to the governors of the church; and that deprivation is from <HI>office,</HI> as well as from the &s;alary. They declared here&s;y, Popery, common &s;wearing, bla&s;phemy, perjury, adultery, ince&s;t, fornication, man-&s;laughter, theft, common oppre&s;&s;ion, common drunkenne&s;s, taking of immo|derate u&s;ury, non-re&s;idence at their charges, unne|ce&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence from them, or neglect of the duties thereof for forty days in a year, without very rele|vant grounds, or their holding of more benefices than one at the &s;ame time, or their dilapidation of
<PB N="45" REF="45">
the church-rents, or their &s;imony, to he &s;ufficient grounds of <HI>depo&s;ing</HI> mini&s;ters. They remon&s;trated to king James, That, by the advice of his coun&s;el|lors, he had, to the di&s;honour of Chri&s;t, a&s;&s;umed a &s;piritual head&s;hip over the church, &s;omewhat &s;imilar to that of the Pope; that eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices were be&s;towed upon men that were violently intrud|ed into the mini&s;terial office; that pre&s;byteries, &s;y|nods, and General A&s;&s;emblies were, by letters of horning, hindered from cen&s;uring the &s;candalous; that while Dury was &s;u&s;pended and bani&s;hed for his faithfulne&s;s, Montgomery, though &s;candalous and excommunicated, was entertained and required to preach; that the privy council had by an act preten|ded to annul his excommunication; that &s;uch as a|bu&s;ed, hurt, or murdered mini&s;ters or others, con|cerned in the pro&s;ecution of Montgomery, and other &s;candalous per&s;ons, were not puni&s;hed, but favour|ed; that, contrary to his promi&s;e, Lennox had ne|ver reformed his family from Popery or Papi&s;ts; and that the laws, which had been made for the mainte|nance of the true religion, and for puni&s;hment of its open enemies, were not executed;&mdash;and in|&s;i&s;ted for the redre&s;s of the&s;e grievances. Lennox and Arran thought to intimidate and pro&s;ecute the pre&s;enters of this remon&s;trance. But when they &s;aw how boldly A. Melvin &s;ub&s;cribed it, before their face, they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them in &s;afety, &s;u&s;pecting that they were &s;upported by &s;ome &s;ecret influence.</P>
<P>While James, and Lennox, and Arran his direc|tors, continued oppre&s;&s;ing the church, the nominal bi&s;hops, fearle&s;s of cen&s;ure, abandoned them&s;elves to their wonted enormities. But the nobles having re&s;cued James out of their hands, and taken Arran pri&s;oner, and charged Lennox to return home to France, the General A&s;&s;embly appointed particular Pre&s;byteries to pro&s;ecute the bi&s;hops of Murray, Aberdeen, Brechin, Dunkeld, St. Andrews, and Dunblain, for neglecting their mini&s;terial work, and for their familiarity with excommunicated per|&s;ons,
<PB N="46" REF="46">
wa&s;ting of the church's patrimony, and other per&s;onal &s;candals. They &s;upplicated his maje&s;ty and E&s;tates, That the acts of Parliament relative to the liberties and juri&s;diction of the church, be &s;o ex|plained and enlarged, as that &s;he may have the &s;ole power of the admi&s;&s;ion or deprivation of mini&s;ters, trial of their doctrine, and &s;topping of, or loo&s;ing from, cen&s;ure; that pre&s;byteries of pa&s;tors and rul|ing elders be legally authori&s;ed, and an adequate puni&s;hment denounced again&s;t &s;uch as oppo&s;e their meetings; that Synodical and General A&s;&s;emblies be authori&s;ed to meet as often they find nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the church, and have full power to ap|point their own time and place of meeting; that no league be made with the Papi&s;ts abroad, and that &s;uch as have, contrary to their oath, apo&s;tatized to Popery, be puni&s;hed with bani&s;hment or otherwi&s;e, as traitors to God; that proper methods be taken to recover the patrimony of the church, and pro|vide for her mini&s;ters; that all pre&s;entations be di|rected to Pre&s;byteries; that mini&s;ters di&s;abled for their work by age or trouble enjoy their &s;alaries for life. They al&s;o declared all bapti&s;m of infants by laicks to be void and null.</P>
<P>For ten months, while the Lords had the directi|on of James, mini&s;ters had full liberty to execute their office; Papi&s;ts, excommunicated and licentious per&s;ons, either left the country, or a&s;&s;umed an ap|pearance of Prote&s;tant religion and &s;ober conver&s;a|tion: the friend&s;hip between Scotland and England revived. James him&s;elf, in a multitude of forms,&mdash; the convention of E&s;tates, and the General A&s;&s;em|bly, had all declared the nobles taking him out of the hands of Lennox and Arran his evil coun&s;ellors, to be a lawful, hone&s;t, and good &s;ervice, to him and the nation,&mdash;for which they &s;hould never be pur&s;u|ed. But James' new tutors being more intent to in&s;truct him in the methods of virtue and lawful go|vernment, than to flatter his pride and other pre|dominant lu&s;ts, he &s;oon wearied of them, and made

his e&s;cape from them, in June 1583. And, not|with&s;tanding all the remon&s;trances of the General A&s;&s;embly, Papi&s;ts were as highly favoured by him as ever. Archbi&s;hop Adam&s;on, a drunken glutton, under pretence of drinking &s;paw water, repaired to England, to contrive with the managers there, the proper methods of effectually introducing Epi&s;copacy into Scotland.&mdash;Though &s;carcely &s;eventeen years of age, James returned to his former work of per&s;e|cuting &s;uch as faithfully te&s;tified again&s;t the proceed|ings of him and his favourites. Dury was charged to remove from Edinburgh, and remain at Montro&s;e. A. Melvin was cited before the privy council for &s;ome &s;peeches he was &s;aid to have uttered at a public fa&s;t. The univer&s;ity of St. Andrews pre&s;ented a &s;olemn atte&s;tation of his innocence, &s;ub&s;cribed by 30 of the principal per&s;ons in the college and place. But James and his courtiers di&s;regarded every thing that was in favours of &s;uch mini&s;ters as were faith|ful and zealous; it was only pitiful and &s;candalous wretches, that they inclined to protect. Melvin compeared, and after prote&s;ting, that it belonged to eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts to judge of his doctrine, he re|peated and vindicated his words. While James and his council raged, he laid down his Hebrew bible be|fore them, and told them, that there were his in|&s;tructions for preaching. After admitting his ene|mies to be witne&s;&s;es, they could find nothing in his words to make an handle of; and therefore re&s;olv|ed to impri&s;on him in the ca&s;tle of Blackne&s;s, on ac|count of his refu&s;ing them to be proper judges of his doctrine. But he retired into England. All the&s;e that had been principally concerned in re&s;cuing James from his wicked directors, were charged to leave the country, and never to return to Britain or Ireland, without his expre&s;s licence; and all their &s;ervants were prohibited to come within ten miles of his re&s;idence.</P>
<P>But few of the mini&s;ters dared to meet in the A&s;&s;embly 1584. Nor dur&s;t even the&s;e tran&s;act any
<PB N="48" REF="48">
bu&s;ine&s;s. Faithful mini&s;ters were every where per|&s;ecuted. Spies were employed to watch their &s;er|mons, and inform the court, if they uttered any words, on which they might be pro&s;ecuted. Pat|rick Galloway &s;uffered no &s;mall trouble for denounc|ing the ju&s;t judgments of God again&s;t tho&s;e that &s;ubverted the Prote&s;tant religion, and abu&s;ed his ma|je&s;ty and his authority. David&s;on, Carmichael, Pol|wart, and others, were obliged to flee into England. After Adam&s;on had laboured to render our faithful mini&s;ters as odious as po&s;&s;ible, and concerted how to conform the Scotch church to the Engli&s;h, he returned home. A Parliament was &s;oon after held in May, with &s;uch &s;ecre&s;y and di&s;patch, that it was almo&s;t ended, before it was heard of. Adam&s;on and Montgomery repre&s;ented the E&s;tate of bi&s;hops in it A lord of the articles having informed &s;ome mini&s;|ters of Edinburgh of it, they, in vain, attempted to get acce&s;s to it. This Parliament enacted, That his maje&s;ty had the &s;upreme authority in all cau&s;es <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> as well as civil; that all refu&s;ing to ac|knowledge the privy council as judges in any matter, or pretending that things merely eccle&s;ia&s;tical did not belong to the civil juri&s;diction, or attempting to di|mini&s;h the power and privileges of bi&s;hops, that were the 3d e&s;tate in Parliament, &s;hould be held and puni&s;hed as high trea&s;on; that all holding of a&s;&s;em|blies, eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil, without his maje&s;ty's &s;pecial permi&s;&s;ion or appointment, or the uttering of any fal&s;e or reproachful &s;peeches again&s;t him or his ance&s;tors or mini&s;ters, from pulpits or otherwi&s;e, &s;hould be capitally puni&s;hed. When the&s;e acts were proclaimed, Balcanquel and Pont prote&s;ted again&s;t them. James, having ordered the magi&s;trates of Edinburgh to impri&s;on all &s;uch as dared, from the pulpit, to utter one word again&s;t the&s;e acts, Balcan|quel and Law&s;on fled into England, and remitted a faithful warning to their people; to which James ob|liged the town council to return a mo&s;t abu&s;ive an|&s;wer. The mini&s;ters replied in a di&s;creet vindication
<PB N="49" REF="49">
of them&s;elves. Another Parliament, that year, e|nacted, That every mini&s;ter, reader, and ma&s;ter of a college, &s;hould within forty days &s;ub&s;cribe the above acts of Parliament, and &s;olemnly engage to ob&s;erve them, and to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to bi&s;hops as their ordinaries, under pain of lo&s;ing their &s;tipends.&mdash; Craig, and too many others, complied; but mo&s;t of the more faithful mini&s;ters fled into England.</P>
<P>In 1585, Elizabeth having taken offence at the &s;laughter of &s;ome of her &s;ubjects by the Scotch bor|derers, the fugitive lords returned; and a pe&s;tilence prevailing in Edinburgh and places about, they got James into their management, and reduced Arran to his original meanne&s;s. But they manife&s;ted more zeal for the recovery of their own civil property, power, and dignity, than for the redre&s;s of eccle&s;i|a&s;tical grievances. When the Parliament met at Lin|lithgow, the commi&s;&s;ioners from the church pre&s;ent|ed to his Maje&s;ty, a remon&s;trance again&s;t the Era&s;tian acts of the preceding year, to which he gave a &s;oft, but not very important, reply. They were thank|ful, that it was not wor&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted, that he would confer with &s;ome of their mo&s;t judicious and godly mini&s;ters concerning the di&s;cipline of the church, in order to have it di&s;tinctly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Parlia|ment. Not long after, a conference was held between &s;ome of the privy coun&s;ellors and &s;ome clergymen, who, from their allowance of power to bi&s;hops and their chapters, appear to have been none of the &s;tricte&s;t.</P>
<P>In 1586, the Synod of Fife excommunicated arch|bi&s;hop Adam&s;on, for his wicked intru&s;ion of him&s;elf into that Antichri&s;tian office, and his wicked and contemptuous behaviour in it: But he appealed from them to his Maje&s;ty, E&s;tates of Parliament, and Privy Council; and drawing up a form of <HI>excommu|nication</HI> again&s;t James and Andrew Melvins, and o|thers of the more faithful members of the Synod, he cau&s;ed his boy, attended by one or two of his jack|men, to read it in the church; and notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="50" REF="50">
his own excommunication, and a preceding &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion, he would preach.&mdash;In con&s;equence of his &s;ham &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, corroborated by James' &s;olicitation, the next A&s;&s;embly took off, or rather declared null, his Synodical excommunication; again&s;t which Andrew Melvin and Thomas Buchanan entered their &s;olemn prote&s;t. From the declarations of the Synods of Mer&s;e, Teviotdale, and Tweed ale, it appears, that the mini&s;ters were far enough from unanimity of &s;en|timent concerning the &s;ub&s;cription of the Era&s;tian acts of 1584. But it is &s;till more plain, that, to &s;e|cure re&s;t for archbi&s;hop Adam&s;on, the privy council appointed A. Melvin, profe&s;&s;or of divinity at St. An|drews, to traver&s;e the counties of Angus, Perth, and Mearns, for confuting and converting the trafficking Je&s;uits; and Adam&s;on to &s;upply his place, by teach|ing two le&s;&s;ons of divinity every week. But as this change was like to have ruined the college by the de|parture of all the foreign and other &s;tudents of divi|nity, king James, at the univer&s;ity's reque&s;t, per|mitted A. Melvin to return to his work. But his per&s;ecution of Gib&s;on and Cowper, manife&s;ts, that James &s;till hated all tho&s;e that dared to te&s;tify again&s;t his conduct from the pulpit. He at once bani&s;hed all the mini&s;ters of Edinburgh, becau&s;e they would not pray for his mother's life, before they had pro|per evidence of the inju&s;tice of her condemnation. He &s;upported Montgomery and Adam&s;on, who&s;e con|duct was ba&s;e, and their con&s;ciences alway at his nod. Pont was pre&s;ented to the bi&s;hoprick of Caithne&s;s; but it &s;eems, he refu&s;ed to accept of it. Le&s;ly, a &s;tanch Papi&s;t, who had &s;o zealou&s;ly &s;upported Mary in England, was re&s;tored to his bi&s;hoprick of Ro&s;s.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a remon&s;trance from the mini|&s;ters, the Parliament, 1587, enacted, That Je&s;uits and trafficking prie&s;ts, hearers of ma&s;s, and apo&s;tates to Popery, &s;hould be duly pro&s;ecuted and puni&s;hed. The preceding laws relative to the Prote&s;tant religion were renewed and confirmed, by a general act.&mdash; And, from regard to the king's pur&s;e, the epi&s;copal

About the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ime, the General A&s;&s;embly prohibited archbi&s;hop Adam&s;on to marry the Popi&s;h earl of Huntly; and al&s;o ob&s;erved two fa&s;ts, the one upon Thur&s;day, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he other on the Lord's day;&mdash;and agreed, that there|after, the fir&s;t day of every General A&s;&s;embly, &s;hould be employed in <HI>fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>humiliation.</HI> Another &s;o|lemn fa&s;t was ob&s;erved about the end of October, on three &s;everal Sabbaths,&mdash;with which they connected the admini&s;tration of the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the remarkable defeat of the pon|tifically ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Spani&s;h Armada</HI> in 1588, the earls of Huntly, Errol, Crawfurd, and others, maintained a corre&s;pondence with Philip of Spain, and with the Duke of Parma, in order to promote a Spani&s;h inva|&s;ion. The di&s;covery of their treachery procured pompous, but &s;carce ever executed, laws again&s;t the Papi&s;ts. Upon a &s;upplication from the A&s;&s;embly, the <HI>Bond</HI> for religion was again ratified in council. Orders were i&s;&s;ued for about ninety-&s;ix mini&s;ters, in the different parts of the nation, to conveen the <HI>god|ly and well affected</HI> of all ranks, and admini&s;ter to them the <HI>national covenant,</HI> and take their &s;ub&s;crip|tions to it, and to the late <HI>bond</HI> for maintenance of religion and his Maje&s;ty's authority. To prevent tu|mults by Papi&s;ts, about 130 of the nobility and gen|try were appointed to attend and &s;upport them, in this work. The zeal of the Pre&s;byterian clergy for James' &s;afety, manife&s;ted in this and other matters of
<PB N="52" REF="52">
that critical juncture, and their keeping of his king|dom in &s;uch order, while he took his romantic voyage to bring home his new queen from Denmark, &s;o in|gratiated them, that, taking one of his religious fits, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf in their General A&s;&s;embly, and extolled their con&s;titution, as highly preferable to that of any other church upon earth. Archbi&s;hop Adam&s;on's dying recantation,&mdash;his profe&s;&s;ion of his &s;in in marrying Huntly in oppo&s;ition to the authority of the church, and in oppo&s;ing his Pre&s;bytery, and &s;landerou&s;ly defending the Era&s;tian acts of the Parlia|ment 1584,&mdash;and of his &s;orrow for the &s;ame, and his earne&s;t &s;olicitation to be ab&s;olved from the excom|munication pronounced again&s;t him by the Synod of Fife, al&s;o encouraged the faithful part of the clergy.</P>
<P>For the confirmation of their Pre&s;byterian govern|ment, the A&s;&s;embly had required all mini&s;ters and intrants to &s;ub&s;cribe their <HI>&s;econd Book of di&s;cipline.</HI> James, who had rendered him&s;elf odious to many of his &s;ubjects, by his continued favour to the Popi&s;h lords, and by neglecting to avenge the murder of the late earl of Murray, upon Huntly, one of them, was become fond of their favour. At their reque&s;t, and perhaps by means of Maitland his chancellor, who needed to wipe off &s;u&s;picions of his having a hand in that murder, he held a conference with &s;ome of the principal of them,&mdash;in con&s;equence of which an act was made by the Parliament, June 1592, <HI>ratify|ing Pre&s;byterian government, and appointing the regu|lar meeting of A&s;&s;emblies, and a&s;&s;igning to Synods, Pre&s;|byteries, and Se&s;&s;ions, their re&s;pective work:</HI> and an|nulling all former acts in the time of Popery, con|trary hereto, and declaring, that the acts of 1584, &s;hould not hinder the church to exerci&s;e her own in|trin&s;ic power in judging eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es,&mdash;and an|nulling the act which granted commi&s;&s;ions to bi&s;hops, and appointing all pre&s;entations to eccle&s;ia&s;tical char|ges to be directed to Pre&s;byteries,&mdash;and appointing them to accept of candidates pre&s;ented by his Maje&s;|ty or other patrons, if duly qualified. This Parlia|ment
<PB N="53" REF="53">
further enacted, That if patrons did not time|ou&s;ly pre&s;ent a qualified candidate, the right of pre|&s;entation &s;hould devolve on the Pre&s;bytery.&mdash;And they prohibited all markets on the Lord's day, or erection of church lands or tithes into temporal lord|&s;hips.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this favourable act, it appears, from the rea&s;ons of their fa&s;t on two Sabbaths of December, That a con&s;iderable part of the nation continued peri&s;hing in ignorance for want of teach|ers; that many of all ranks, e&s;pecially of the nobility, were inclined to Popery and Athei&s;m; that Je&s;uits, and other Popi&s;h prie&s;ts, &s;warmed without controul; that bla&s;phemy of God's name, contempt of his word, and of civil magi&s;trates,&mdash;trea&s;on, murder, a|dultery, witchcraft, and other like abominations, mightily prevailed. The A&s;&s;embly appointed Me&s;&s;. John David&s;on, Robert Bruce, Walter Balcanquel, David Lind&s;ay, and four others, as a &s;tanding com|mittee, to e&s;py the dangers of the church; and ap|pointed brethren in the different parts of the nation to give them proper information concerning Papi&s;ts and immoralities.</P>
<P>By letters intercepted in the end of this year, it was found, that the earls of Huntly, Errol, and An|gus, and others of inferior rank, had continued their trea&s;onable corre&s;pondence with Philip of Spain, and that it was intended, that 30,000 Spaniards &s;hould invade the kingdom, either at Kirkudbright in Gal|loway, or at the mouth of the Clyde, we&s;tward of Gla&s;gow. Hereupon, James emitted a proclamation again&s;t the guilty, and called his &s;ubjects to make a re&s;olute &s;tand for the defence of their country; and he, and a con&s;iderable number of his nobles, barons, and others, entered into a &s;olemn a&s;&s;ociation or co|venant, to exert them&s;elves to their utmo&s;t in defence of the Prote&s;tant religion, and in puni&s;hing the trai|tors. But notwith&s;tanding all this parade, James took care to protect his Papal friends, who &s;ought his life, and the Parliament 1593, as good as ab&s;olv|ed
<PB N="54" REF="54">
them, under pretence, that no proper proof could be had again&s;t them. This rendered them and their brethren more and more in&s;olent. The Synod of Fife made this a ground of fa&s;ting; and, to James' great vexation, delivered up unto Satan, Huntly, Errol, Angus, and Home, and their principal a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants, as apo&s;tates to Popery; and Huntly and the laird of Auchindown, as al&s;o murderers of the earl of Murray. The General A&s;&s;embly, not only form|ed 48 particular Pre&s;byteries, appointed rules for the vi&s;itation of them, and prohibited mini&s;ters to pub|li&s;h any &s;lander again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, but al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted with him to bring the excommunicated lords to their trial. Chancellor Maitland got that matter referred to the convention of E&s;tates, in which, upon a &s;ham &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;ent up in writ, the&s;e traitors were ab|&s;olved from all pa&s;t trea&s;ons, providing they be good &s;ubjects and Prote&s;tants, for the future, and pay a certain fine. This ab&s;urd indulgence of the ob&s;ti|nate enemies of the religion and liberties of the nati|on, highly provoked the zealous Prote&s;tants, e&s;pe|cially when they ob&s;erved them, regardle&s;s of the terms of their ab&s;olution, proceeding in their wonted cour&s;es. The A&s;&s;embly 1594 confirmed the &s;en|tence of excommunication inflicted by the Synod of Fife, and in&s;i&s;ted with James for their condign pu|ni&s;hment; and that proper methods &s;hould be taken to &s;top the increa&s;e of Popery. He returned them &s;oft words, which, it is probable, he never intend|ed to regard. Lord Home got him&s;elf reconciled to the church. The re&s;t, to whom Bothwel, who had for a time terribly di&s;turbed the nation with his vio|lences, joined him&s;elf, were declared outlaws, and their e&s;tates forfeited. In 1595, we find little more than the A&s;&s;embly's appointment of commi&s;&s;ioners to vi&s;it colleges, plant vacant churches, and try per&s;ons that enjoyed eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices.</P>
<P>Chancellor Maitland, perhaps chiefly to &s;upport him&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to Bothwel, had for &s;ome time pa&s;t favoured the church. After his death, the manage|ment
<PB N="55" REF="55">
of matters chiefly depended on the EIGHT commi&s;&s;ioners for the now &s;uper-expended royal re|venues,&mdash;&s;ome of which were reckoned concealed Papi&s;ts. In the beginning of 1596, James emitted a proclamation, requiring all his &s;ubjects to with&s;tand the Spaniards and all their agents; but he took care not to mention the Popi&s;h lords as any of them. Nay, while, in his beggared condition, he was &s;oli|citing the General A&s;&s;embly for a public contribution in all their congregations to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t the Spaniards, he allowed the wives and friends of the outlawed Papi&s;ts to enjoy the whole of their re|venues.</P>
<P>The General A&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of about 400 mini&s;ters, having met in March, applied them&s;elves to &s;earch out the cau&s;es of the Lord's controver&s;y with the nation, and to appoint mea&s;ures for the better pre&s;ervation of their religion and liberties. They began with an enquiry into the &s;ins of the mi|ni&s;try; and, for remedies of the corruptions which they found among them, they appointed, That all candidates, at their admi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be carefully tried concerning their knowledge, prudence, and &s;piritual experience; that they &s;hould be &s;olemnly interrogated, what had moved them to accept of the charge; that <HI>none</HI> who ingyred them&s;elves, or &s;oli|cited admi&s;&s;ion to a place or charge, <HI>&s;hould be admit|ted,</HI> nor any of the Pre&s;bytery, who had &s;olicited for one, be allowed to act in his election or admi&s;&s;ion; that none &s;hould a&s;k a pre&s;entation, without advice of the Pre&s;bytery, in who&s;e bounds the charge lay; that &s;uch mini&s;ters as &s;hould not be given to prayer and diligent &s;tudy, particularly of the &s;criptures,&mdash; or, who &s;hould not &s;tudy to be &s;piritual and power|ful in their mini&s;trations, and to apply their doctrine in oppo&s;ition to the prevalent corruptions of the place and time; or, who &s;hould preach in a dry, &s;chola&s;tic, and ob&s;cure manner; or who &s;hould be carele&s;s about promoting religion, negligent in vi&s;it|ing the &s;ick, or in taking care of the poor; or, who

Not a few of the clergy being ab&s;ent, the A&s;&s;embly appointed, that there &s;hould be like humiliation and covenanting with God in their &s;ynodical meetings; and in Pre&s;byteries, for the &s;ake of &s;uch as could not attend at Synods.&mdash; The covenant was al&s;o renewed in many congregati|ons; and where it was not, the &s;ub&s;equent defection quickly appeared.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly further repre&s;ented to all ranks in the nation their abounding wickedne&s;s,&mdash;in the de|cay of zeal for the cau&s;e of God,&mdash;the prevailing ig|norance and contempt of God's ordinances,&mdash;the ne|glect of his wor&s;hip in families, or ma&s;ters turning over the performance of it upon their cooks, or other &s;ervants,&mdash;the neglect of &s;piritual conver&s;e, and pre|valence of that which is carnal and profane,&mdash;the countenancing of idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition,&mdash;the ob|&s;ervation of Popi&s;h fe&s;tivals, bonefires, pilgrimages, &s;inging of carols at Chri&s;tma&s;s, <HI>&amp;c;</HI>&mdash;bla&s;phemy of God's name, or cur&s;ing in common di&s;cour&s;e; pro|fanation of the Sabbath, by the labours of &s;eed time and harve&s;t, and by journies and try&s;ts about civil bu&s;ine&s;s, or by carnal &s;ports and recreations, dancing, drinking, or keeping of markets;&mdash;neglect of rela|tive duties, and of the religious education of chil|dren

<P>They repre&s;ented to the courts of civil judicature, their great wickedne&s;s, in their almo&s;t univer&s;al ne|glect of doing ju&s;tice between man and man; their remi&s;&s;ions or reprives in ca&s;es of murder, ince&s;t, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> adultery; the advancement of weak and wicked men into the office of judges; the neglect of puni&s;hing Papi&s;ts, particularly the Popi&s;h lords, and their ad|herents, but allowing the rents of their forfeited e|&s;tates to their wives and friends, who &s;upported them; the allowing of pretended bi&s;hops, abbots, or priors to vote in parliament, in name of the church; buying of pleas; delaying or wre&s;ting of ju&s;tice for the &s;ake of bribes; and &s;uffering about four hundred pari&s;hes to continue without any &s;ixed go&s;|pel mini&s;trations, for want of provi&s;ion to mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>They no le&s;s faithfully repre&s;ented to the king him&s;elf, the &s;ins of his family, that &s;ometimes fami|ly wor&s;hip, and even the reverent a&s;king of God's ble&s;&s;ing upon meals, or giving thanks for them, were neglected; that they made no con&s;cience of attend|ing the &s;ermons on week days; that he and his fa|vourites &s;ometimes conver&s;ed in time of &s;ermon; that he and his courtiers were guilty of profane cur|&s;ing and &s;wearing; that murderers, Papi&s;ts, and ex|communicated per&s;ons, were countenanced in his

<P>IN the end of 1596, the Popi&s;h lords, finding their foreign quarters not to their wi&s;h, re&s;olved to return home, and make their peace with their coun|try, on the ea&s;ie&s;t terms. As it was &s;u&s;pected, that James encouraged, if he did not formally invite them to return, the mini&s;ters took the alarm, and the A&s;|&s;embly and their commi&s;&s;ioners remon&s;trated again&s;t their continuance in the country, as they were noto|rious enemies to its religion and liberties,&mdash;and a|gain&s;t James' allowing the Popi&s;h counte&s;s of Hunt|ly to be pre&s;ent at the bapti&s;m of his daughter Eli|zabeth, and his intru&s;ting that prince&s;s to the care of the Popi&s;h lady of Living&s;ton, who was upon the point of being excommunicated by the church. An|drew Melvin, in his bold and zealous manner, faith|fully repre&s;ented to him his and his council's wick|edne&s;s, in labouring to bear down the faithful mini|&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and to a&s;&s;ume authority in &s;piritual cau&s;es, and to protect the Popi&s;h lords. James gave them no &s;atisfaction, but told them, That he and they would never agree, till the limits of their re&s;pec|tive juri&s;dictions &s;hould be di&s;tinctly fixed; and par|ticularly, till it &s;hould be enacted, that no mini&s;ter &s;hould, from the pulpit, meddle with his and his council's procedure;&mdash;that no General A&s;&s;embly &s;hould meet without his &s;pecial command, nor any deed of it be of any force, before it was ratified by
<PB N="60" REF="60">
him or his commi&s;&s;ioner; and that no church judi|catory &s;hould meddle with any cau&s;es again&s;t which the civil laws do &s;trike.</P>
<P>Not long after, James &s;ummoned Mr. David Black in St. Andrews, to appear before his privy council, to an&s;wer for &s;ome words, which he was &s;aid to have uttered from the pulpit, again&s;t the behaviour of him&s;elf, his queen and council. Black prote&s;ted, that the church was the proper judge of his doctrine at fir&s;t in&s;tance, and declined the authority of the council, as incompetent to be primary judge in this matter. Solemn atte&s;tations of his innocence of that which was laid to his charge, from a great number of his mo&s;t re&s;pectable hearers, in the magi&s;tracy and univer&s;ity, were produced before the council; but the&s;e were altogether di&s;regarded, and the depo|&s;ition of his enemies, however malicious, and of o|thers gro&s;ly ignorant, were &s;u&s;tained again&s;t him as proof: and he was bani&s;hed to the north &s;ide of Tay. About three or four hundred mini&s;ters &s;igned an ad|vice to Mr. Black, to decline the council. None was more active in procuring &s;ub&s;criptions than <HI>Spot&s;|wood,</HI> afterward <HI>archbi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>St. Andrews,</HI> who, at the &s;ame time, treacherou&s;ly informed James of all their procedure. The faithful mini&s;ters earne&s;tly remon&s;trated again&s;t his maje&s;ty and council's judg|ing and puni&s;hing their brother, Mr. Black. But all was in vain. He was determined to humble them.</P>
<P>Highly offended with the commi&s;&s;ioners, whom the church had appointed to watch again&s;t her dan|gers, on account of their faithful information of Pre&s;|byteries, and for their remon&s;trances again&s;t the fa|vour &s;hewn to the Popi&s;h lords, or the like, James charged every one of them to depart from Edin|burgh; and then &s;tretched every nerve, to decoy tho&s;e that remained, into his Era&s;tian mea&s;ures. He promi&s;ed his utmo&s;t efforts to procure better &s;ti|pends to the clergy, if they would demon&s;trate their loyalty, by &s;ub&s;cribing a BOND, which he had or in|tended to form. Fearing that &s;ome, by their pover|ty,
<PB N="61" REF="61">
might be induced to comply, the bani&s;hed com|mi&s;&s;ioners tran&s;mitted a warning to the &s;everal Pre&s;|byteries, to be on their guard. The bond, which James prepared for their &s;ub&s;cription, contained in it a promi&s;e of allegiance, and of &s;ubmitting their doctrine relative to things, which might be reckon|ed to concern the king and his council, to them as proper judges of it, and never to decline their juri&s;|diction as incompetent. Again&s;t the &s;ub&s;cription of this Bond, the mini&s;ters pled, That it was &s;uperflu|ous to bind them&s;elves to allegiance, &s;ince they had done that &s;ufficiently in the <HI>national covenant,</HI> which had been lately renewed; that their doing it, in the manner required in this bond, &s;uppo&s;ed them to have been formerly di&s;loyal; that this bond, proceeding from the church's enemies, was to be &s;u&s;pected as a &s;nare; that the infamy of tho&s;e that &s;ub&s;cribed a like bond, by the in&s;tigation of archbi&s;hop Adam|&s;on in 1584, was a warning to forbear &s;ub&s;cribing at pre&s;ent; that this bond re&s;trained faithful reproof, and means of repentance, and made the king head of the church as well as of the &s;tate, and was contra|ry to the word of God, and to the laws made for the liberties of this church.</P>
<P>Robert Bruce, and other mini&s;ters of Edinburgh, declined to confer with James, till he &s;hould recal the commi&s;&s;ioners of the church, whom he had ba|ni&s;hed from the city. Some courtiers, who hated the EIGHT managers of the royal revenues, by deal|ing with both parties, laboured to kindle &s;trife be|tween them and the church. To free him&s;elf of four hundred pounds Scots of debt, one Robert Stewart a macer, gave up to the king a li&s;t of &s;uch burgers in Edinburgh, as were mo&s;t careful for the &s;afety of faithful mini&s;ters; in con&s;equence of which, 24 of them were charged to depart from the city. Alarmed herewith, Me&s;&s;rs. Balcanquel and Bruce repre&s;ented the dangerous &s;ituation of the church to &s;uch as were well affected to her. They, after mu|tual con&s;ultation, appointed the lords Lind&s;ay and
<PB N="62" REF="62">
Forbes, Mr. Bruce and &s;ome others, to repre&s;ent to his maje&s;ty his duty to interpo&s;e his authority for the prevention of impending dangers: But he refu&s;ed to regard their reque&s;t. Some agents of the court, by rai&s;ing a report, that he had given an unfavour|able an&s;wer; and that the inhabitants were in arms; &mdash;and by crying at the doors of the churches, in which they were a&s;&s;embled, <HI>Save your&s;elves,</HI> and in the &s;treets, <HI>To arms,</HI> rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable mob,&mdash; &s;ome of which thought the king had been in danger, and others, that their mini&s;ters had been murdered. Notwith&s;tanding his &s;ickne&s;s, the provo&s;t ro&s;e, got out, and quelled the uproar.</P>
<P>Affrighted for the con&s;equences, James &s;ent for their petition that &s;ame night, and promi&s;ed to con|tent the mini&s;ters, and their &s;upporters. They in|&s;i&s;ted, that he &s;hould remove from his council, Sea|ton, Elphing&s;ton, and Hamilton, three of the OC|TAVIANS formerly mentioned, whom they judged troublers of the church, and &s;upporters of the ex|communicated Popi&s;h lords; and that the&s;e lords &s;hould be bani&s;hed the country, till they &s;hould offer proper &s;atisfaction to the church and nation;&mdash;and that the commi&s;&s;ioners of the church &s;hould, by a royal proclamation, be invited back to Edinburgh, whence they had been driven. But his fright being over, he refu&s;ed their agents acce&s;s to pre&s;ent the&s;e reque&s;ts to him: and at la&s;t, pretending to be pro|voked with the late tumults, he fled off to Linlith|gow, appointed all &s;trangers to depart from Edin|burgh, and prohibited the judges to hold any more courts in it. Me&s;&s;rs. Bruce, Balcanquel, Balfour, and Wat&s;on, mini&s;ters of Edinburgh, and Cran&s;ton of &mdash;, were &s;ummoned to appear before the privy council at Linlithgow, and an&s;wer as required; and warrants were i&s;&s;ued to apprehend five of the princi|pal burgers, that favoured their cour&s;es. Expecting no ju&s;tice, the mini&s;ters fled, but the burgers com|peared, and were ca&s;t into pri&s;on. The mini&s;ters and other friends of the church, were exceedingly griev|ed
<PB N="63" REF="63">
on accout of the tumult, as they perceived, how it would be improved to the reproach of the work of God in their hands. On the Sabbath after, Mr. Bruce publicly declared his dete&s;tation of it, and of the neutrality of too many mini&s;ters, and of the coun|tenance given to the Popi&s;h lords. After their flight, he, and Balfour, and Wat&s;on, remitted large vindi|cations of them&s;elves and brethren, from all &s;hare in the tumult.</P>
<P>Bent to have the Scotch church conformed to the Engli&s;h, in order that his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to Q. Elizabeth of England might be the ea&s;ier, James had already formed a li&s;t of his intended bi&s;hops; but as things were not yet quite ripe for e&s;tabli&s;hing them in their &s;ees, he publi&s;hed 55 que&s;tions, which he required the General A&s;&s;embly to an&s;wer, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether mat|ters relating to the external government of the church might not be di&s;puted?

For what enormities they may publicly blame magi&s;trates?

Whether the &s;e&s;&s;ion be judges of their mini&s;ter's doctrine? Whether ruling elders may ever moderate in &s;e&s;&s;ions?

<P>Soon after, James called an a&s;&s;embly at Perth, and took care to have an hitherto unparalleled number of north country clergymen to be members of it. Af|ter no &s;mall di&s;puting, the majority voted it to have the power of a <HI>General A&s;&s;embly.</HI> Dropping a num|ber of his above mentioned que&s;tions, James requir|ed them to declare, That it &s;hould be lawful for ei|ther the prince, or any pa&s;tor, to move their doubts, and crave information concerning any part of their government, which is not expre&s;ly appointed in the word of God; that no mini&s;ter &s;hould publicly med|dle with affairs of &s;tate, or with any of his Maje&s;ty's laws and ordinances; but if they think them wrong, privately complain to him&s;elf and his council; that no mini&s;ter &s;hall publicly point out any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, except fugitives and excommunicated per&s;ons, &s;o as the hearers may know them; that none &s;hall med|dle

<P>Few be&s;ides the commi&s;&s;ioners from Fife came up to the ordinary meeting of the General A&s;&s;embly in April 1597. After confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, they took a &s;olemn prote&s;tation for the liberties of the church.&mdash;In May, K. <HI>James' &s;econd A&s;&s;embly</HI> met at Dundee. As he had called them together, his will was their rule, and to plea&s;e him, and his coun|cil, was their great end. Upon information from the Pre&s;byteries of Murray, Aberdeen, and Angus, concerning the excommunicated lords, the&s;e Pre&s;by|teries were appointed further to deal with them, and to receive them upon terms much the &s;ame as above mentioned. They added &s;ome explications to the declarations, which had been required or given at Perth. They an&s;wered the re&s;t of James' en&s;nar|ing que&s;tions, as much to his content as they could. They appointed a commi&s;&s;ion of their number to confer with his maje&s;ty for promoting of perfect har|mony with him and his council, and to execute the articles which had been pa&s;&s;ed. Thus, I think began the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ions</HI> of the General A&s;&s;emblies, which have often tran&s;acted more public work, than the A&s;&s;embly it&s;elf.&mdash;The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, now appoint|ed, together with James and his agents, dre&s;&s;ed up matters to their plea&s;ure; and the A&s;&s;emblies as their tools turned their will into the form of acts. To prevent the faithful mini&s;ters from counteracting
<PB N="68" REF="68">
their de&s;igns, the principal of them were put out of the way. Black and Wallace were removed from St. Andrews. A. Melvin had been put from his rector&s;hip, and expelled the univer&s;ity, had not the clamour of the people and of the foreign &s;tudents obliged them to let him alone. But, to prevent his interfering with the government of the church, James and his eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ioners enacted, That no ma&s;ters or profe&s;&s;ors in univer&s;ities &s;hould vote in any church courts upon matters of di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The Popi&s;h lords being re&s;tored to the fellow&s;hip of the church, the Parliament, which met in De|cember, re&s;tored them to all their civil privileges and honours.&mdash;Some years before, mention had been made of eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;it in Parliament, as the 3d e&s;tate, in&s;tead of the dignita|ries of the Popi&s;h church; but without any hint, whether they &s;hould be clergymen or not. Now the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;ome mini&s;ters &s;hould have <HI>vote in Parliament</HI> in order to &s;ecure the intere&s;ts of the church. The abbots, priors, and lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, oppo&s;ed it, as derogatory to their power. But James got it carried; and the more ea|&s;ily, as the other e&s;tates of Parliament thought that no Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter would accept the Popi&s;h title of <HI>bi&s;hop, abbot, or prior,</HI> in order to enjoy &s;uch promotion. Having carried this point, James and his eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion appointed next General A&s;&s;embly to meet at Dundee, two months &s;ooner than had been intended. After it had met, and a|greed to bury &s;ome grievances, and appointed another commi&s;&s;ion, and James had allowed the bani&s;hed mi|ni&s;ters to return to their charges in Edinburgh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash;he, in a &s;olemn harangue, repre&s;ented to the A&s;|&s;embly the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome mini&s;ters voting in Par|liament, and prote&s;ted, that he had no intention to introduce any Popi&s;h or Engli&s;h bi&s;hops, but was merely concerned for the welfare of the church. The &s;peeches of tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ioners, that thir&s;ted for epi&s;copal &s;ees, were but an echo to
<PB N="69" REF="69">
his. After much warm debate, it carried, that a|bout <HI>fifty one</HI> mini&s;ters &s;hould have a vote in Parlia|ment as <HI>commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> from the church, but under &s;trict limitations, in order to prevent their a&s;&s;uming any power over their brethren. Mr. David&s;on of Pre&s;ton-pans entered a &s;olemn prote&s;tation again&s;t this act, but it was not allowed to be marked. The terror of his maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence kept many of his brethren from adhering to his prote&s;t. But he had no &s;ooner cro&s;&s;ed the Tay in his way home, than a|bout three or four&s;core &s;ub&s;cribed it, though it was afterward thought prudent to cut off their names. This A&s;&s;embly further enacted, That the minutes of Synods be brought up to every A&s;&s;embly in order to be examined; that none be married till they be thrice lawfully proclaimed; that &s;uch mini&s;ters as celebrate clande&s;tine marriages be depo&s;ed; and that the par|ties &s;atisfy the church by <HI>public repentance;</HI> that no images be carried about at burials; that pre&s;byteries meet every week; and that a propo&s;ition of divinity be handled in their meeting once a month; that e|very mini&s;ter have a weekly examination of part of his congregation; that every Pre&s;bytery &s;end up commi&s;&s;ioners to the A&s;&s;embly, not above three in their own name, and a ruling elder in name of the barons, and two ruling elders from Edinburgh, and one in the name of every other burgh.</P>
<P>About the beginning of 1599, James appears to have been &s;eized with a fit of zeal for the Romi&s;h a|bominations. Beaton, the old Popi&s;h archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, was re&s;tored to his dignity, and appointed amba&s;&s;ador to the court of France. James tran&s;mit|ted an affectionate mi&s;&s;ive to his Holine&s;s, and re|que&s;ted that the bi&s;hop of Vai&s;on, a Scotchman, might be created a cardinal, and empowered to act in the corre&s;pondence betwixt them. Edward Drummond was in&s;tructed by James to negotiate with the Pope and his cardinals for promoting this de&s;ign. This affair happening afterward to be divul|ged, &s;ecretary Elphing&s;ton, who had been made earl
<PB N="70" REF="70">
of Balmerino, took the blame upon him&s;elf, and had a &s;ham proce&s;s directed again&s;t him, on that ac|count. But few that con&s;ider James' con&s;tant regard to the Popi&s;h party, and the mean &s;hifts, with which he ordinarily attempted to cover his ba&s;e de&s;igns, will doubt of his being the real author of that let|ter. In his <HI>Ba&s;ilicon doron,</HI> publi&s;hed that year, he declares, That parity among mini&s;ters is incon&s;i&s;tent with monarchy; that without bi&s;hops, the three e&s;tates of Parliament cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed; that Pre&s;byterian zealots &s;eek to e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>democracy</HI> in the &s;tate; that kings ought to hate none more than proud Puritans, and ought never to &s;uffer their chiefs in any kingdom.</P>
<P>To make voting of mini&s;ters in Parliament go down the more quietly with the nation, &s;everal con|ferences were held concerning it. The&s;e of Falk|land, where the CAVEATS were con&s;idered, and of Holyroodhou&s;e, were the mo&s;t noted. In the la&s;t, after reading the act of A&s;&s;embly at Dundee, con|cerning the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners from the church to vote in Parliament, and the <HI>caveats for limiting their power,</HI> the mini&s;ters entered on the di&s;pute, but could nei|ther agree upon the lawfulne&s;s of their voting, or the title that &s;hould be given them. Highly pro|voked with the bold &s;peeches and unan&s;werable rea|&s;onings of Andrew Melvin and his friends, James threatened, that if they would not fill up the 3d e|&s;tate of Parliament with their eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;i|oners, he would fill it up as he plea&s;ed. His maje&s;|ty &s;till needing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the complai&s;ant clergy of the north, the A&s;&s;embly 1600 met at Mon|tro&s;e. This affair was introduced by a conference be|tween four on each &s;ide. Patrick Sharp, James Melvin, Patrick Simp&s;on, and David Barclay on the one hand maintained, That the acts of Parliament, and A&s;&s;embly, appointing mini&s;ters to vote in Par|liament, are directly contrary to the word of God,&mdash; as all eccle&s;ia&s;tical prelacy and carnal dignity are, Luke xxii. 25, 26. Matth. xx. 26. 1 Tim. iii. Tit. i.
<PB N="71" REF="71">
1 Pet. v. 1,&mdash;3.&mdash;as it makes men, who are &s;eparat|ed to the &s;ervice of God, turn back to the world and the offices of it, Num. iii. 44, 45. and xviii. 6. Deut. x. 8. and xviii. 12. Acts xiii. 1.2, 3. Rom. i. 1. &mdash;as it hinders mini&s;ters from their proper work, Luke ix. 59, 60. Deut. xxxiii. 8. Acts vi. 2. hinders them from preaching the word in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on, 1 Chron. ix. 33. 2 Tim. iv. 2. John xxi. 15, 16, 17. Acts xx. 20, 28.&mdash;as it repre&s;ents the mini|&s;terial charge to be light and incon&s;iderable, contrary to Ezek. iii; xxxiii. Zech. xi. 17. Acts xx. 20, 28, 31. 1 Pet. v. 2. 2 Cor. ii. 15,&mdash;17. Heb. xiii. 17.&mdash; as it confounds offices and juri&s;dictions, which God hath di&s;tingui&s;hed, Num. xviii, 4, 7. 2 Chron. xvii; xix. Matth. xxii. 21. Deut. xxii. 9,&mdash;11.&mdash;as it makes mini&s;ters to meddle with things not pertain|ing to their office, 1 Pet. iv. 15. John xvi. 15. and xviii. 36. Luke xii. 13, 14.

<P>So &s;trong was the rea&s;oning, and &s;o firm the oppo|&s;ition, that James, by all his authority and craft, could not obtain that the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be continued till death, or till &s;ome fault &s;hould render them unworthy of their power, but merely, that they &s;hould be cho&s;en every year. But he and his party got the act &s;o marked in the minutes, as to import no more, than that they &s;hould, every year, give an account of their conduct, and lay down their commi&s;&s;ion at the feet of the A&s;&s;embly. The CA|VEATS, formerly agreed upon in the conference at Falkland, were ingro&s;&s;ed into this act, and imported, That the A&s;&s;embly with advice of Pre&s;byteries and Synods &s;hould nominate &s;ix out every di&s;trict, from

whom his maje&s;ty &s;hould choo&s;e one; That the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould never propo&s;e any thing in name of the church, without &s;pecial direction from her, or &s;uch things as they can an&s;wer for to her; that, under pain of depo&s;ition, they &s;hould never forbear to oppo&s;e what was prejudicial to the liberty of the church; that, under pain of infamy and ex|communication, they &s;hould give account of their conduct to every A&s;&s;embly, and obtain a ratification of it; that they &s;hould re&s;t contented with whatever benefice the king allows them, without attempting to hurt the &s;alary of any other mini&s;ter; that they &s;hould neither directly nor indirectly dilapidate their benefices, nor grant any di&s;po&s;ition or lea&s;e of it, without content of his maje&s;ty and the General A&s;|&s;embly; that they &s;hould continue to execute the office of pa&s;tor to their congregation in all points, and be &s;ubject to the trial of Pre&s;bytery and Synod, as other brethren; that, under pain of deprivation, and of the nullity of every thing afterward tran&s;ac|ted by them, they &s;hould never claim any power a|bove their brethren in the exerci&s;e of church govern|ment; that in Pre&s;byteries, Synods, and General A&s;&s;emblies, they &s;hould in all things behave as other mini&s;ters; that before their admi&s;&s;ion to their <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ioner&s;hip,</HI> they &s;hould &s;wear to ob&s;erve the above <HI>limitations</HI> exactly; and that upon their depo&s;ition from the mini&s;try, they &s;hould lo&s;e their benefice and &s;eat in Parliament.&mdash;It was further ordained, That they &s;hould have no vote in General A&s;&s;emblies, unle&s;s by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion from their pre&s;byteries; and that their <HI>ambitus</HI> or u&s;ing of any means to ob|tain preferment, &s;hould be &s;u&s;tained a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of deprivation.&mdash;This A&s;&s;embly appointed a com|mi&s;&s;ion to fini&s;h their work, any nine of whom, with his maje&s;ty and his agent, made a <HI>quorum</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> number &s;ufficient for acting.</P>
<P>Convinced, that James' veracity was little to be depended upon, Me&s;&s;rs. Bruce, Balcanquel, Balfour, Wat&s;on, and Hall, mini&s;ters of Edinburgh, he&s;i|tated
<PB N="73" REF="73">
to publi&s;h his repre&s;entation of his danger and his deliverance from a con&s;piracy of the earl of Gowry and his brother at Perth, in the way of public thank&s;|giving to God. He therefore prohibited them to preach in his dominions, under pain of death. As the citizens would accept of no other in their &s;tead, he was obliged to permit them all to return, except Mr. Bruce, who therefore retired to France. Nor did James re&s;t, till he had got Balcanquel, Balfour, and Wat&s;on, tran&s;ported, and &s;ome of his own crea|tures put in their place.</P>
<P>To prevent the faithful mini&s;ters attendance, or ready oppo&s;ition of his mea&s;ures, James cau&s;ed the General A&s;&s;embly to meet at Burnti&s;land, in May 1601, ten weeks &s;ooner than had been appointed. Neverthele&s;s, Me&s;&s;rs. David&s;on of Pre&s;ton pans, and James Melvin of An&s;truther tran&s;mitted their moni|tory letters, obte&s;ting all the members to be faithful to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to the manifold corruptions then creeping in. To deceive the ho|ne&s;t party, James and his complai&s;ant dupes joined them in a&s;&s;ignation of the cau&s;es of the decay of re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igion, and of proper remedies thereof: <HI>viz.</HI> the wrath of God on account of the contempt of the go&s;pel; the &s;loth of mini&s;ters, and their neglect to di&s;cover apo&s;tates from the Prote&s;tant religion; the want of able mini&s;ters, e&s;pecially where the Popi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ords and other nobles re&s;ide; the ra&s;h admi&s;&s;ion of candidates into the mini&s;terial office; the untender conver&s;ation of mini&s;ters, and their &s;uiting of them|&s;elves to the humours of their people; the de&s;olation of the churches of Edinburgh; the advancement of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll affected per&s;ons into places of power and tru&s;t; the education of his maje&s;ty's children in the compa|ny of Papi&s;ts, and of the young nobility by &s;u&s;pected ma&s;ters; the decay of &s;chools; the overlooking of the re&s;tored lords non-performance of the terms of their reconcilement. They, however, took care to make no mention of their own attempts to overturn the reformation which had been attained, and to
<PB N="74" REF="74">
render the church dependent on the mere will of the civil magi&s;trate.&mdash;Not long after, Mr. Bruce wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> permitted to return home; but it was required o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him to imitate his other he&s;itating brethren, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|different places to intimate from the pulpit his belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of James' account of the perhaps altogether pretend|ed con&s;piracy. He abhorred &s;uch &s;inful and &s;neak|ing compliances, and &s;o continued under the roya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> frowns.</P>
<P>The next General A&s;&s;embly was appointed to mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at St. Andrews, in the end of July 1602: but James, to mark his &s;piritual &s;upremacy, transferred it to Ho|lyroodhou&s;e, on the 10th of November following. At the entry, James Mevin prote&s;ted again&s;t the change of the day. The mini&s;ters, who had been appointed to deal with Huntly, Errol, Angus, Home, and Herreis, reported their conduct: but, except that of tho&s;e who had attended Errol, it was little to the purpo&s;e. Notwith&s;tanding their former ne|gligence, young Spot&s;wood and the re&s;t were ap|pointed to deal further with them, and with the o|ther Popi&s;h lords, Maxwel and Semple. A nume|rous committee was appointed to vi&s;it the church, and enquire into the conduct of mini&s;ters, congre|gations, and Pre&s;byteries; and <HI>Rules of vi&s;itation</HI> were pre&s;cribed. But the leading men in it were too intent on prelatical dignities to execute this work to any good purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Synod of Fife pre&s;ented a number of grievan|ces; That General A&s;&s;emblies were not regularly held according to the laws of God and the land, or the nece&s;&s;ity of the church, but the diets of meeting altered without the knowledge or con&s;ent of either Pre&s;bytery or Synod; that mini&s;ters were &s;ummoned before the privy council at fir&s;t in&s;tance, to an&s;wer for their doctrine, or manner of di&s;cipline; that ap|plications in Pre&s;byterial exerci&s;es were condemned; that the government of the church was put into the hand of a few commi&s;&s;ioners, to the injury of Pre&s;by|teries and Synods; that the doctors of univer&s;ities

<P>But with much more plea&s;ure, the A&s;&s;embly con|&s;idered a plan for the enlargement of their &s;tipends; &mdash;and, at James' de&s;ire, allowed of the celebration of marriage on the Lord's day; and ordered, that all who made profe&s;&s;ion of the Prote&s;tant faith &s;hould have their children baptized. Young Spot&s;wood was accu&s;ed of attending ma&s;s in France: but James and his complai&s;ant clergy got this matter hu&s;hed. &mdash;This A&s;&s;embly was far from being FREE. Me&s;&s;. R. Bruce, J. David&s;on, and A. Melvin, were ex|pre&s;ly prohibited to come near it. Such as faithful|ly &s;poke their mind were upbraided and mocked by the king or the moderator, and commanded to be &s;ilent.&mdash;Not long after, &s;ome further pains were taken with Mr. Bruce to make him approve James' account of Gowry's con&s;piracy. But, finding, that no conde&s;cen&s;ion would procure his re&s;toration to his flock at Edinburgh, he would make none, and re|pre&s;ented his rea&s;ons to the town council. The Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly declared his kirk va|cant, and at the &s;ame diet, approved a marriage be|tween

two adulterers, both of who&s;e former yoke|fellows were &s;till living, and ab&s;olved them from the excommunication inflicted on them by the mini&s;ters of the &s;outh.</P>
<P>When James &s;et off for London to receive the Engli&s;h crown in A. D. 1603, all the impri&s;oned malefactors were liberated. But A. Melvin and J. David&s;on had their confinement continued, and R. Bruce continued &s;ecluded from his charge. Appre|hending, that James' communion with the Engli&s;h church would lead him to attempt a reducing of the Scotch to the &s;ame forms of wor&s;hip and govern|ment, the Synod of Fife in 1604, appointed &s;ome of their number to pre&s;ent their faithful advice to the A&s;&s;embly's commi&s;&s;ion, begging them to in&s;i&s;t for a Parliamentary ratification of all former laws made in favours of the church, and to prote&s;t, that any thing enacted contrary to the religion pre&s;ently e&s;tabli&s;hed by either commi&s;&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e, &s;hould be held null and void; and to in&s;i&s;t, that none &s;hould vote in parliament, in the name of the church, but &s;uch as bear office in her, and are appointed by her; and that &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall not, under pain of de|po&s;ition, propo&s;e any thing in Parliament in the name of the church, without expre&s;s direction from her; nor keep &s;ilence, when any thing detrimental to her intere&s;ts is propo&s;ed; and that care be taken, that no prejudice be done to her doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, or government, by the intended UNION of Scotland with England.</P>
<P>Spot&s;wood, now made archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, in|&s;tead of Beaton the Romi&s;h prie&s;t, Glad&s;tones bi&s;h|op of Galloway, and Lind&s;ay bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, being appointed commi&s;&s;ioners for regulating the terms of that UNION, marked an ab&s;olute unconcern about every thing religious. But the earl of Morton in|&s;i&s;ted for a clau&s;e in their commi&s;&s;ion, bearing, That the &s;tate of religion in doctrine and di&s;cipline &s;hould be pre&s;erved in Scotland.

<P>With K. James' own con&s;ent, the A&s;&s;embly at Ho|lyroodhou&s;e had appointed their next meeting at A|berdeen, in July 1604. But the eccle&s;ia&s;tical com|mi&s;&s;ioners to &s;it in Parliament, fearing to give ac|count of their conduct, procured a delay. James re|quired, that the meeting &s;hould be deferred till the union of the two kingdoms &s;hould be deliberately con&s;idered, and a new warrant for holding it emit|ted. Neverthele&s;s, the Pre&s;bytery of St. Andrews, zealous for the liberties of the church, appointed Me&s;&s;rs. James Melvin, William Er&s;kine, and Willi|am Murray, their commi&s;&s;ioners to attend it. Upon the day appointed, they repaired to the place of meet|ing in Aberdeen, and &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, That the hurt that &s;hould happen to Chri&s;t's church, by the neglect of this meeting, &s;hould not be imputed to them, or their con&s;tituents. In&s;tigated by &s;ome nor|thern mini&s;ters, the Pre&s;bytery of St. Andrews, by their mi&s;&s;ives and otherwi&s;e, procured &s;uch a num|ber of corre&s;pondents from other parts of the king|dom to attend at next Synod of Fife, that Lauri&s;ton, the king's commi&s;&s;ioner for eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, fear|ing that it would turn out a General A&s;&s;embly, pro|cured an order from the privy council to hinder their meeting. But finding, that they only claimed the powers of a Synod, he forbore. Heavy complaints were made, that the church's commi&s;&s;ioners to vote in Parliament did not ob&s;erve the CAVEATS; and that &s;ome, who had been nominated to bi&s;hopricks,
<PB N="78" REF="78">
voted without any commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The Synod agreed to petition his Maje&s;ty, That General A&s;&s;emblies might be regularly held, according to the act of Par|liament, and the former cu&s;tom of this church; that Papi&s;ts and contemners of church di&s;cipline might be pro&s;ecuted by the civil judges; that he him&s;elf would interpo&s;e for the protection of the per&s;ecuted Engli&s;h Puritans, and for the redre&s;s of &s;uch mi|ni&s;ters as had their &s;alaries injured by the la&s;t modi|fication of &s;tipends.</P>
<P>James had appointed the meeting of the General A&s;&s;embly at Aberdeen, July 2, 1605, unle&s;s he &s;hould conveen it &s;ooner. The fearful abounding of &s;candal, Popery, and almo&s;t every thing horrid, made Pre&s;byteries and Synods to &s;upplicate for the ha&s;ten|ing of this meeting. But Spot&s;wood, Hall, Glad|&s;tones, and Galloway, their commi&s;&s;ioners to his Maje&s;ty, betrayed them, and chiefly courted his fa|vour and prelatical preferments.&mdash;When the time of meeting drew near, James tran&s;mitted orders not to hold it. And to confound commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;ome co|pies of this order repre&s;ented the 2d, and others the 5th of July, as the day formerly appointed. No more than nineteen members met on the 2d day. When Lauri&s;ton &s;aw them determined to proceed regularly to bu&s;ine&s;s, he left them. Mr. John For|bes being cho&s;en Moderator, they read the order of the privy council requiring them to di&s;&s;olve, and to appoint no new diet of meeting: they agreed to pro|ceed to no further bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent; but appoint|ed their next meeting at Aberdeen, upon the la&s;t Wedne&s;day of September next, and appointed the &s;everal Pre&s;byteries to direct their commi&s;&s;ioners to it. As they were about to di&s;mi&s;s, Lauri&s;ton return|ed, and prote&s;ted, That from the beginning he did not acknowledge them a lawful A&s;&s;embly. Upon the 5th of July, Mr. John Wel&s;h and other &s;even com|mi&s;&s;ioners from the &s;outh and we&s;t came up, and finding the meeting di&s;&s;olved, prote&s;ted that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> came up to keep it, and that they approved of wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

had been done. Returning to the privy council&punc; Lauri&s;ton affirmed, That upon Monday the fir&s;t of July, he had, by a public proclamation at the cro&s;s of Aberdeen, prohibited the meeting of A&s;&s;embly in his maje&s;ty's name. But though multitudes were on the &s;pot the whole day, not one could te&s;tify, that he heard this public proclamation. To corroborate Lauri&s;ton's fal&s;e affirmation, it is &s;aid, that the clerk antedated the indor&s;ement of the charge.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters, who had kept this meeting of the A&s;&s;embly were immediately pro&s;ecuted before the privy council. The magi&s;trates of Aberdeen were charged to prevent the meeting in September; and Pre&s;byteries and Synods prohibited to own the vali|dity of the late meeting. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;|&s;ion readily declared it void and null to all intents. After three months impri&s;onment in Blackne&s;s ca&s;tle, &mdash;and vindication of their own conduct, and de|clining of the privy council as incompetent judges, Me&s;&s;rs. John Forbes, John Wel&s;h, Robert Dury, Andrew Duncan, Alexander Strachan, and John Sharp, were condemned to perpetual bani&s;hment from the kingdom, as guilty of high trea&s;on; and had probably been hanged, had not the terrible fer|ment of the nation intimidated James and his coun|cil. Me&s;&s;rs. Charles Fairholm, John Monro, Nath. Inglis, James Greig, William Forbes, John Ro&s;s, and Robert Young&s;on, after lying in different pri|&s;ons, were bani&s;hed to remote parts of the king|dom. All mini&s;ters were prohibited publicly to pray for, or make honourable mention of their condem|ned brethren.</P>
<P>Neither the terrible pe&s;tilence, of which about 70,000 are &s;aid to have died in or about London, and not a few about Edinburgh, St. Andrews, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor his own and his Engli&s;h Parliament's remarkable deliverance from immediate de&s;truction by the Popi&s;h <HI>gun powder plot,</HI> diverted James from his beloved work of per&s;ecuting the faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and introducing the Engli&s;h Epi&s;copacy into Scot|land.

Upon &s;ome new revival of Mr. Bruce's he&s;i|tation to believe his account of Gowry's con&s;piracy, he was confined to Inverne&s;s. A. and J. Melvins, James Balfour, William Scot, John Carmichael, Robert Wallace, Adam Coult, and William Wat&s;on, were called out of the way to London, under pretence of conferring with them concerning the lawfulne&s;s of the meeting at Aberdeen, and the proper method of holding General A&s;&s;emblies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> James Melvin died in his return home. After three years impri|&s;onment, on account of a &s;hort Latin &s;atyre on the Engli&s;h wor&s;hip in his Maje&s;ty's chapel, Andrew was permitted to retire to France, where he died.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, James having called a Parliament at Perth, in 1606, which &s;olemnly acknowledged his &s;upremacy in ALL cau&s;es; and appointed an oath of the &s;ame import to be &s;worn <HI>upon the go&s;pels.</HI> They al&s;o re&s;tored the e&s;tate of bi&s;hops to all their antient honours, rights, and revenues; and erected chap|ters for their re&s;pective &s;ees. Again&s;t this deed, the two Melvins, ju&s;t before they &s;et off for London, with about forty others, of whom Ballantyne, Aber|nethy, and Cooper, were afterward bi&s;hops, enter|ed a &s;olemn prote&s;tation, bearing, That it was con|trary to the word of God, their national covenant, the con&s;titutions of this church, and the laws, peace, and honour, of the kingdom. Their rea&s;ons were more largely explained in a tract then publi&s;hed un|der the title of <HI>The cour&s;e of conformity.</HI> An A&s;&s;em|bly was &s;oon after held at Linlithgow, which con&s;i&s;t|ed of &s;uch &s;tate&s;men, and of &s;uch clergymen, as James called up, without any regard to commi&s;&s;ions from their re&s;pective Pre&s;byteries. Under pretence of zeal again&s;t Popery, they appointed a mini&s;ter in every Pre&s;bytery, who &s;hould inform the privy coun|cil again&s;t Papi&s;ts, and who &s;hould have a yearly &s;a|lary of an hundred pound Scots for his pains, and al&s;o the honour of con&s;tantly moderating in his Pre&s;|bytery, till proper cour&s;e &s;hould be taken with the Papi&s;ts, and the peace of the church &s;ettled. They
<PB N="81" REF="81">
&s;upplicated his Maje&s;ty in favours of &s;uch of the ba|ni&s;hed mini&s;ters as &s;hould confe&s;s their faults to him. The nominated bi&s;hops prote&s;ted, That they intend|ed to u&s;urp no pre-eminence over their brethren. Some CAUTIONS were propo&s;ed for limitation of the power of the con&s;tant moderators. Neverthele&s;s, the managers, within about &s;ix months, had the mi|nute &s;o formed, as to bear, that the con&s;tant mode|rators of Pre&s;byteries &s;hould be con&s;tant members of General A&s;&s;emblies, and the bi&s;hops or their vicars con&s;tant moderators in Synods. Fully per&s;uaded, that his innovations would meet with warm oppo&s;i|tion, James, by a proclamation, &s;olemnly charged all the NOMINEES to accept of their new honours, and all Pre&s;byteries and Synods, under pain of re|bellion, to accept of their con&s;tant moderators. Ne|verthele&s;s, &s;everal of the mini&s;ters nominated to be con&s;tant moderators of Pre&s;byteries refu&s;ed that pro|motion. Many Pre&s;byteries, and all the Synods, except that of Angus, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed their con|&s;tant moderators. Some Pre&s;byteries admitted them only, when compelled to it under pain of rebellion, and upon condition that the matter &s;hould be can|va&s;&s;ed in a free and lawful General A&s;&s;embly, which they did not think that of Linlithgow to be. The principal oppo&s;ers were bani&s;hed, impri&s;oned, or o|therwi&s;e per&s;ecuted; &s;uch mini&s;ters as needed, or hoped for augmentation of their &s;tipends, could not obtain letters of pro&s;ecution for it, before the bi&s;hops or con&s;tant moderators granted them warrants for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>James intended to conveen another A&s;&s;embly at Linlithgow&punc; for promoting his introduction of bi|&s;hops. By cau&s;ing &s;ome commi&s;&s;ioners, who had been long before appointed to vi&s;it the Pre&s;byteries, and procure commi&s;&s;ioners to it; and by a zealous &s;preading of Dr. Downham's &s;ermon in favours of the Engli&s;h Epi&s;copacy, he and his agents laboured to promote their cau&s;e.

<P>Archbi&s;hop Spot&s;wood having become an extra|ordinary Lord of the SESSION, about the beginning of A. D. 1610, led the way for him&s;elf, and his cle|rical partizans, to &s;crew them&s;elves further into civil offices. Soon after, he, and Glad&s;tones, archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, had each of them a royal warrant to hold <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion courts</HI> within their re&s;pective boundaries, which might puni&s;h per&s;ons as they plea|&s;ed, in a civil or an eccle&s;ia&s;tical manner. Their appointed a&s;&s;i&s;tants were noblemen, bi&s;hops, gentle|men and mini&s;ters, &s;ome of which la&s;t appear to have been nominated merely for form &s;ake, as it could not be expected, that they would accept of any &s;uch an|tichri&s;tian and arbitrary power. But the archbi&s;hop, with any four that he plea&s;ed, were declared a <HI>quo|rum,</HI> &s;ufficient to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s. The bi&s;hops having become lords in Parliament, privy council, Exchequer, and Se&s;&s;ion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of exten&s;ive pro|perty and juri&s;diction, patrons of many benefices, mo|derators in Synods, &s;tated commi&s;&s;ioners of the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly, and principal members in the king's courts of high commi&s;&s;ion,&mdash;a General A&s;&s;embly was called at Gla&s;gow in June 1610, when no body ex|pected it, and ju&s;t after his maje&s;ty, by his procla|mation, had required another, appointed a few days before, not to be held. It con&s;i&s;ted of 169 mem|bers, <HI>viz.</HI> con&s;tant moderators of Synods and Pre&s;|byteries, who already had their annual &s;alaries of 100 pounds, and hoped for better at his maje&s;ty's hand, together with &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners from Pre&s;byteries, as were reckoned &s;educible into the mea&s;ures of the
<PB N="84" REF="84">
court. Plenty of bribes, under the name of <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence money,</HI> were di&s;tributed among them, and others had better &s;tipends promi&s;ed them. The northern clergy came up from the remote&s;t corners, and brought with them con&s;ciences &s;ufficiently complai&s;ant. The earl of Dunbar, attended by a troop of his maje&s;|ty's life guards, did all that he could to promote his ma&s;ter's intentions. They condemned the A&s;&s;embly of 1605, at Aberdeen, as an <HI>unlawful</HI> and <HI>&s;editious</HI> meeting. They acknowledged the power of calling A&s;&s;emblies to be an inherent right of the crown. They enacted, That no ordination of pa&s;tors &s;hould be confirmed unle&s;s it was con&s;ummated by the bi&s;h|op; that no mini&s;ter &s;hould be deprived without the con&s;ent of the bi&s;hop; that bi&s;hops or their vi|cars &s;hould pre&s;ide in all provincial &s;ynods and Ge|neral A&s;&s;emblies,&mdash;and have the &s;ole power of vi&s;it|ing the dioce&s;es. Under pretence of only changing the name of <HI>Pre&s;byteries,</HI> which they &s;aid was offen|&s;ive to his maje&s;ty, into the <HI>meetings of the mini&s;ters of their bounds,</HI> they left bi&s;hops at liberty to choo&s;e whom they plea&s;ed for <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> rather than <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants</HI> in their acts of juri&s;diction. They further enac|ted, That all pre&s;entations &s;hould be directed to bi&s;hops in&s;tead of Pre&s;byteries; that no excommu|nication or ab&s;olution &s;hould take place, without the bi&s;hop's direction; that mini&s;ters ab&s;enting of them|&s;elves from epi&s;copal vi&s;itations of their dioce&s;es &s;hould infer &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and depo&s;ition, if continued in; that every intrant &s;hould, at his admi&s;&s;ion to the mini&s;try, &s;wear allegiance to his maje&s;ty as &s;u|preme governor in the con&s;ervation and purgation of religion, as well as in things temporal; to which it &s;eems they afterward clande&s;tinely added <HI>obedience to his ordinary</HI> (i. e.) bi&s;hop of the bounds; <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;that marriage &s;hould be celebrated upon the Lord's day, if people de&s;ired it;&mdash;that the two archbi&s;hops, three other bi&s;hops, and three others appointed by them, &s;hould deal with his maje&s;ty for the planting of vacan|cies. They al&s;o formed &s;ome &s;ham directions for the
<PB N="85" REF="85">
bi&s;hops, and a&s;&s;erted the nece&s;&s;ity of General A&s;&s;em|blies, and their power over bi&s;hops: and finally e|nacted, That no mini&s;ter under pain of depo&s;ition &s;hould publicly &s;peak again&s;t their acts, or treat of the equality or inequality of mini&s;ters, in the church of Chri&s;t.&mdash;As Me&s;&s;rs. Patrick Sim&s;on and Walt. Balcanquel, and others, loudly inveighed again&s;t the apo&s;tacy and perjury of the bi&s;hops, James, by a proclamation, charged all his &s;ubjects, under the highe&s;t pains, not to impugn, but obey, all the acts of the A&s;&s;embly, and to inform the next magi&s;trate or &s;ome member of the privy council of every thing contrary, which they knew; and charged all judges and magi&s;trates immediately to impri&s;on all tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors, mini&s;ters or others.</P>
<P>As James and his votaries did not expect, that even their above packed A&s;&s;embly would di&s;tingui&s;h the office of a bi&s;hop from that of a pa&s;tor, in the manner of <HI>Bancroft,</HI> and other late high flyers, in England, no mention was made in it of the con&s;e|cration of bi&s;hops. But &s;oon after, Spot&s;wood of Gla&s;gow&punc; Lamb of Brechin, and Hamilton of Gal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oway, po&s;ted to London for it; and on their re|turn con&s;ecrated their brethren, without con&s;ulting either Pre&s;bytery or Synod.&mdash;Glad&s;tones of St. An|drews met with very little oppo&s;ition in the Synod of Angus, but in the&s;e of Fife and Lothian, with much more than he wi&s;hed.&mdash;When the Parliament met in 1612, they formally <HI>annulled</HI> their deed of 1592, <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing pre&s;bytery;</HI> they ratified the acts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate A&s;&s;embly of Gla&s;gow with explications, curtail|ments, enlargements, and alterations. By this act of Parliament, bi&s;hops were freed from all trial of their life or doctrine by the General A&s;&s;embly; they might depute whom they plea&s;ed to be moderators in Synods; they might di&s;po&s;e of all benefices to which the patron did not pre&s;ent a qualified candi|date within &s;ix months from the commencement of the vacancy: if the bi&s;hop refu&s;ed to admit his can|didate, the patron might appeal to the archbi&s;hop,
<PB N="86" REF="86">
and from him to the lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion or privy council, that they, by letters of horning, might oblige the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e to do his duty. In the oath for intrants to the mini&s;try, they mu&s;t &s;wear allegi|ance to the king as &s;upreme in all cau&s;es <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> as well as temporal, and &s;wear obedience to their ordinary.&mdash;It was not required, that men &s;hould be forty years of age, or ten years in the mi|ni&s;try, before their election to bi&s;hopricks; nor was the continuance of the weekly meetings of mini&s;ters, in the lea&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>After a little breathing, James and his agents pu&s;h|ed on their de&s;igns. In 1615, all adult &s;ubjects were commanded to receive the Lord's &s;upper at Ea&s;ter in all time coming. Spot&s;wood being now archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, and Law of Gla&s;gow, they united their <HI>high commi&s;&s;ion courts,</HI> in order to render their &s;entences more powerful and &s;triking; and four mem|bers, with one archbi&s;hop, had full power to tran|&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s. None might appeal from their deci&s;i|ons to either privy council, or lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion. As Popery &s;till increa&s;ed, and the earl of Huntly made con&s;iderable di&s;turbance in the country, the A&s;&s;em|bly of Aberdeen in 1616, made no &s;mall empty noi&s;e, how to check the increa&s;e of Popery and promote the conviction or puni&s;hment of Papi&s;ts. They pub|li&s;hed a new <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> chiefly directed a|gain&s;t the errors and corruptions of the Romi&s;h church; and to exclude the national covenant, they appointed all officers in the church, and &s;tudents in the colleges to &s;wear and &s;ub&s;cribe it. They al&s;o ap|pointed bi&s;hops Galloway, Hall, and Adam&s;on, to compo&s;e a &s;mall catechi&s;m for public u&s;e, in order to exclude tho&s;e of <HI>Craig</HI> and <HI>David&s;on.</HI> Upon &s;ome &s;ham &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they ab&s;olved the excommunicated earl of Huntly.

<P>BUT in vain either church or &s;tate expected happine&s;s under Charles I. who pur&s;ued the maxims and copied the pattern of his father.

This was reckoned the more grievous, as the <HI>articles of Perth</HI> had occa&s;ioned ma|nifold prejudices and contentions among tho&s;e that had formerly lived in the mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip. Charles having appointed a national fa&s;t on the 20th of July, the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters added to his rea|&s;ons others of their own.

In&s;tead of regarding it, Charles, by a letter to Spot&s;wood, in&s;tigated him and his fellow bi&s;hops, to proceed in the cour&s;e, in|to which his father had put them. They extolled his piety to the highe&s;t, and &s;o zealou&s;ly obeyed his orders, that if a mini&s;ter but conformed to Epi&s;copa|cy and the articles of Perth, he was almo&s;t in no danger of being quarreled for any thing el&s;e.</P>

<P>As few of the communicants in &s;everal churches, in or about Edinburgh, had <HI>kneeled</HI> at the &s;acrament at Ea&s;ter the preceding year, the general &s;e&s;&s;ion, which met before it in 1628, begged their mini&s;ters to di&s;pen&s;e it in the antient manner, for the avoid|ing of &s;trife and confu&s;ion. Some of the&s;e were for allowing every one to &s;it or kneel as he plea&s;ed. Others were for no kneeling, and for the communi|cants dividing the elements among them&s;elves. The Non-conformi&s;ts in&s;i&s;ted, That they &s;hould fir&s;t ce|lebrate the &s;acrament in the former manner, and then &s;upplicate his maje&s;ty's favour; if he were di&s;|plea&s;ed. But the Conformi&s;ts got it carried, fir&s;t to &s;upplicate his permi&s;&s;ion. In their &s;upplication, and by Syd&s;erf their commi&s;&s;ioner, they repre&s;ented, That
<PB N="96" REF="96">
few of their people now joined in the Lord's &s;upper&punc; and few of tho&s;e that did, would receive it <HI>kneeling;</HI> that notwith&s;tanding all their pains to extingui&s;h it, the contention was &s;till increa&s;ing, and had already become intolerable; that by means of it, mini&s;ters inveighed again&s;t, and people hated, one another; that athei&s;ts were tempted to reckon the whole of religion an indifferent thing, which might be altered at men's plea&s;ure; that kneeling at the communion had an appearance of &s;ymbolizing with Papi&s;ts, and encouraged them in their idolatrous wor&s;hip of the &s;acramental bread;&mdash;and be&s;ought him to di&s;pen&s;e with their obedience to the act of A&s;&s;embly and Par|liament impo&s;ing it. In&s;tead of granting their re|que&s;t, Charles appointed the archbi&s;hop of St. An|drews to cite them to his tribunal, and inflict &s;uch puni&s;hment upon their ring-leaders, as might effec|tually deter others from all &s;uch &s;upplications for the future; and to labour with all his might to e&s;tabli&s;h the form of wor&s;hip appointed by law. The&s;e things prevented the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Lord's &s;upper at Edinburgh for that &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;&mdash;Upon the two la&s;t Sabbaths of May, and the Wedne&s;day betwixt them, Charles appointed a &s;olemn fa&s;t to lament the trou|bled &s;tate of the churches abroad, and the &s;ins a|bounding at home, and to be&s;eech the Lord to avert his threatened judgments, and &s;ucceed his Maje&s;ty's arms again&s;t France. To the&s;e, &s;ome Non-confor|mi&s;ts added the innovations made upon the govern|ment and wor&s;hip of the church, and the per&s;ecuti|on of faithful mini&s;ters for oppo&s;ing them; which fomented the difference between the two parties. The Non-conformi&s;ts more and more gained the af|fections of the people, while the Conformi&s;ts, lo&s;ing their e&s;teem, in&s;tigated the bi&s;hops to per&s;ecute them, &mdash;who, having power on their &s;ide, threatened to excommunicate all &s;uch as &s;hould not &s;peedily con|form. Being excluded from all the churches of Edinburgh, Mr. Robert Bruce preached in &s;everal of the&s;e in the neighbourhood, whither multitudes
<PB N="97" REF="97">
of the citizens re&s;orted to hear him. Informed of this, Charles required his privy council to confine him to his own hou&s;e in Kinnaird, and within two miles around: but about the &s;ame time required the excommunication of the Popi&s;h earls of Angus, Nith&s;|dale, Abercorn, and their ladies, to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and no laws executed again&s;t them, till him&s;elf &s;hould come down to Scotland.</P>
<P>While, about the beginning of A. D. 1629, Dr. Forbes of Aberdeen, Wedderburn of St. Andrews, and Maxwel and Syd&s;erf of Edinburgh, occupied them&s;elves in venting their Arminian tenets, which now paved the way for preferment, the privy coun|cil, alarmed by repeated complaints of the increa&s;e and in&s;olence of the Papi&s;ts, appeared more than ordinary earne&s;t, in pro&s;ecuting them, particularly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f they were excommunicated; and in taking care of the Prote&s;tant education of their children. Not to appear behind them in zeal, the conforming clergy took up a li&s;t of about 500 gentry and others, and &s;ent up Maxwel to London to learn his maje&s;ty's plea|&s;ure concerning them. But Huntly, thro' the queen's influence, procured &s;uch an order of &s;oft dealing with them, as amounted to a kind of royal protection of them. Meanwhile, the Pre&s;byterians were more and more cruelly per&s;ecuted, many of the inhabitants of Edinburgh, Leith and places adjacent, being cited before the privy council and High Commi&s;&s;ion, and arbitrarily fined, if they did not an&s;wer to &s;atisfacti|on. Me&s;&s;rs. Lamb of Traquair, D. Forre&s;t of Leith, and George Dunbar of Air, were depo&s;ed for their oppo&s;ition to the cour&s;e of defection. Robert Mel|vil, a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the aged mini&s;ter of Culro&s;s, having in a &s;ermon, before him, boldly inveighed again&s;t the pride of Adam Ballantyne bi&s;hop of Dumblain, and his contempt of the faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, had no doubt al&s;o been pro&s;ecuted, if he could have been deprived of any legal &s;alary. The bi&s;hops re|garded the affronts, which they received from the poeple, the le&s;s, as his maje&s;ty highly favoured

<P>The pride of the bi&s;hops having rendered them o+dious to a great part of the nobility, a number of mi+ni&s;ters, about the end of this year, tran&s;mitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Repre&s;entation of 28 <HI>grievances</HI> to his maje&s;ty; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> begged, That he would interpo&s;e his influence fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the redre&s;s of them.

<P>In 1631, the apo&s;tacy &s;till increa&s;ed. Dr. Max|wel taught, That our Saviour at his death de&s;cended to hell, in order to deliver from it the &s;ouls of virtu|ous heathens; pretending, that this doctrine tended

much to his glory, and to the comfort of Chri&s;tians. John Adam&s;on of Libberton taught, That the church of Rome is a true church of Chri&s;t. Wedderburn of St. Andrews and Syd&s;erf, without controul, pub|li&s;hed their Arminian errors: Many of the conform clergy, and e&s;pecially the bi&s;hops, altogether aban|doned them&s;elves to drinking in taverns, and &s;ports on Sabbath afternoons.

<P>Nothing of importance relative to the church hap|pened in 1632. But, next year, Charles, attended by bi&s;hop Laud and many others, came down to E|dinburgh, in order to be crowned, and to aboli&s;h the remains of Pre&s;bytery, and perfect the religious con|formity of the two nations. After being crowned in the mo&s;t &s;plendid and ceremonious manner, he, on next Sabbath, was gratified with the Engli&s;h mode of wor&s;hip, and with the mo&s;t ful&s;om flattery from the pulpit, and the mo&s;t in&s;olent railing again&s;t &s;uch as &s;crupled at holy ve&s;tments, or any thing el&s;e,
<PB N="101" REF="101">
which he plea&s;ed to appoint in the wor&s;hip of God. The afternoon was &s;pent in extravagant fea&s;ting, at|tended with concerts of mu&s;ic, &s;ounding of trumpets, and the like profane, carnal parade. The Parliament having met, a&s;&s;erted his &s;upremacy over the church in all cau&s;es, and his power of pre&s;cribing proper ve&s;tments for clergymen, the la&s;t of which it &s;eems his father had never executed. They ratified all former acts in favours of the religion pre&s;ently pro|fe&s;&s;ed, that is, as they had dre&s;&s;ed it up with Epi&s;co|pacy and &s;uper&s;tition. Hence the faithful party op|po&s;ed their ratification. They ratified his revocation of his progenitor's grants of tithes and church lands. The faithful mini&s;ters delivered to Sir John Hay, clerk regi&s;ter, under form of prote&s;tation, a petition for <HI>redre&s;s of grievances,</HI> craving, That as the com|mi&s;&s;ioners from the church had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the CA|VEATS, they might be &s;u&s;pended from voting in Parliament, till they were heard again&s;t them on that point; that the alterations in the act of Parlia|ment 1612, from that of the A&s;&s;embly 1610, might be rectified; that the act 1592, e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;e&s;&s;ions, Pre&s;byteries, Synods, and General A&s;&s;emblies, might be revi&s;ed and ratified; that, as was promi&s;ed when they were introduced, none &s;hould be urged to ob|&s;erve the <HI>articles of Perth;</HI> and that all impo&s;ition of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aths not appointed by the A&s;&s;embly or Parliament <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Intrants, be prohibited. Sir John, being a &s;worn enemy to religion, and &s;lave to the bi&s;hops, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ighly offended with the petition, and e&s;pecially with Mr. Hog's &s;olemn manner of delivering it. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame mini&s;ters, by Mr. Hog, tran&s;mitted another &s;upplication to Charles him&s;elf, who lodged at Dal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eith, be&s;eeching him to favour their forementioned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etition in the Parliament.

In&s;tigated by the mini&s;ters, a number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he lords, barons, and burge&s;&s;es, pre&s;ented to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing and Parliament a petition, craving, That the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ovations</HI> lately introduced into the church, &s;hould

be aboli&s;hed; that &s;uch as had no intere&s;t in the happine&s;s of the kingdom, or had been declared in|capable of being judges in any court, &s;hould be de|barred from &s;eats in the Parliament. Charles hear|tily abhorred their reque&s;ts. Neverthele&s;s, he had no &s;mall difficulty to carry the ratification of his &s;pi|ritual &s;upremacy, and of the hierarchy and &s;uper&s;ti|tion, which his father had introduced. Notwith|&s;tanding all his &s;olicitations and threatenings, and even calling for a pen to mark their names that &s;erv|ed or oppo&s;ed him, <HI>fifteen</HI> earls and lords, with <HI>for|ty-four</HI> commi&s;&s;ioners from burghs, voted again&s;t that act. Bi&s;hop Burnet affirms, that it was really carried in the negative. But Hay the regi&s;ter, who collected the votes, affirming that it was carried in the affirmative, the earl of Rothes, who had oppo&s;ed it with great freedom and &s;trength of rea&s;oning, a|verred the contrary. Charles, meanly interpo&s;ing, told Rothes, that the clerk's declaration mu&s;t &s;tand, unle&s;s he, at the hazard of lo&s;ing his head, would prove him guilty of fal&s;ifying the records of Parlia|ment. Knowing that Charles, in&s;tigated by his bi&s;h|ops, would rain down his vengeance upon them, as &s;oon as he could get an opportunity, the nobles pre|pared a repre&s;entation of their de&s;igns and rea&s;ons thereof. But either their want of unanimity among them&s;elves; or their information of his intention to refu&s;e to hear it; or his &s;udden departure to Lon|don, prevented their pre&s;enting it to him.</P>
<P>Having returned home, and made Laud, his faith|ful attendant, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, he tran|&s;mitted an order to Ballantyne, bi&s;hop of Dumblain, and dean of his royal chapel at Edinburgh, to take care to have the communion there received on their knees, and in cups con&s;ecrated to the king's u&s;e, on the fir&s;t Sabbath of every month, and to cau&s;e all the lords of privy council and &s;e&s;&s;ion, advocates, clerks, and writers to the &s;ignet to receive it in due form, at lea&s;t once every year, as a pattern to others; and to report their obedience or di&s;obedience in this mat|ter

to him. Neverthele&s;s, it is &s;aid, that no more than &s;ix lords of privy council, &s;even of &s;e&s;&s;ion, two advocates, one writer to the &s;ignet, with the clerk of the bills, and two young lords, conformed to this order.</P>
<P>While Charles had been in Scotland, he had e|rected a new bi&s;hoprick at Edinburgh, and nominat|ed William Forbes, a mini&s;ter of the city, zealous for the reconcilement of the popi&s;h and prote&s;tant religions, to it. After a farce of election by the chapter, he was &s;olemnly con&s;ecrated, in January, 1634, in the pre&s;ence of the two archbi&s;hops and five bi&s;hops; and had the <HI>little</HI> and <HI>great kirks</HI> unit|ed to form his cathedral. Notwith&s;tanding his monki&s;h temper, he immediately di&s;per&s;ed his man|dates, requiring all mini&s;ters in his dioce&s;e, within fourteen days, to &s;ub&s;cribe an engagement to full conformity, and to admini&s;trate the &s;acraments to none, but tho&s;e of their own congregations, under pain of being puni&s;hed as &s;chi&s;matics. Mo&s;t of the Pre&s;bytery of Edinburgh &s;ub&s;cribed the engagement, on the &s;ame day that they received his mandate. Four of them took it to an advi&s;ement. But William Arthur at We&s;tkirk, and James Thom&s;on at Colling|ton, flatly refu&s;ed their &s;ub&s;cription. Other Pre&s;|byteries were much le&s;s complai&s;ant. Some expre&s;|ly refu&s;ed to come under any &s;uch engagement. The Pre&s;bytery of Greenlaw tran&s;mitted to him their rea&s;ons again&s;t compliance, and warned him, that the wrath of God would certainly overtake him, if he per&s;i&s;ted in requiring mini&s;ters to act contrary to their con&s;cience. He had &s;carcely threatened to make the be&s;t in Edinburgh kneel at the communion, or lo&s;e his Epi&s;copal gown, when a vomiting of blood put an end to his violent mea&s;ures, about two months after his in&s;talment. To obtain his fat benefice, Syd&s;erf laboured to imitate him in Arminiani&s;m, and in approaches towards Popery. But Charles, know|ing him to be much hated in Edinburgh, tran&s;ported

<P>A rude draught of the intended addre&s;s of the nobles to his maje&s;ty, at the conclu&s;ion of the above mentioned Parliament, having been left in the hands of Balmerino, one Dunmuir a writer, who had been allowed to view his library, clande&s;tinely took a copy of it, which he inadvertently &s;hewed to Hay of Naughton, who took a copy of it, while he &s;lept, and tran&s;mitted it to archbi&s;hop Spot&s;wood. He, as u&s;ual, po&s;ted off with it on the Lord's day for Lon|don; and repre&s;ented to Charles, That it amounted to lea&s;e-making again&s;t him and his government; and that copies of it were indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread by the noblemen concerned in it, in order to alienate his &s;ubjects, and make mini&s;ters to refu&s;e the ve&s;t|ments, and other rites pre&s;cribed by law. At la&s;t, he and his fellow bi&s;hops procured a commi&s;&s;ion for &s;ome ignorant, mercenary, or Popi&s;h creatures of the court, to try the authors and favourers of it, as guilty of trea&s;on.

John Mein merchant in Edinburgh was again pro&s;e|cuted for not ob&s;erving an anniver&s;ary fa&s;t, and at|tending his own pari&s;h church. The members of the <HI>college of ju&s;tice</HI> and people of Edinburgh, were
<PB N="106" REF="106">
mightily urged to perfect conformity, in all the no|vations introduced. Thus the bi&s;hops carried all be|fore them, leaving little el&s;e for the friends of re|formation, but to cry to the Lord becau&s;e of their oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1636, Maxwel bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, who was already a lord of the privy council, a lord of the exchequer, and an extraordinary lord of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, thought to have got the high trea&s;urer&s;hip, which Morton demitted. But the nobles, offended with Spot&s;wood's promotion to the chancellor&s;hip, procured that office for the earl of Traquair, who often proved a thorn in the &s;ide of the bi&s;hops. Tra|quair's procuring a pen&s;ion of 200 pound &s;terling for Maxwel, &s;ilenced him a little. But when he &s;olicit|ed the di&s;&s;olution of the commi&s;&s;ion for valuation of tithes, Traquair, by gaining not only the nobles, but even part of the bi&s;hops to the oppo&s;ition, pre|vented his &s;ucce&s;s. Spot&s;wood dur&s;t not appear a|gain&s;t Traquair, for fear he &s;hould detect his villan|ies. The archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow had obtained a roy|al grant of the fir&s;t fruits in his dioce&s;e; but Tra|quair found means to pocket them him&s;elf. He al&s;o thought to oblige the inhabitants of Gla&s;gow to pay their mini&s;ters &s;tipends, and to deprive their council of the Patronage of <HI>Blackfriars</HI> and the <HI>Low-kirks;</HI> but Traquair defeated his plea.</P>
<P>In 1630, Mr. Samuel Rutherfoord had been cit|ed before the high commi&s;&s;ion; but a &s;torm hinder|ing Spot&s;wood to cro&s;s the Forth, and Alexander Colvil, one of the judges, befriending him, the diet was de&s;erted. Some mini&s;ters in his pre&s;bytery, la|bouring to exa&s;perate Spot&s;wood again&s;t him, a new pro&s;ecution of him and Mr. Dalglei&s;h was intended in 1634. But Lord Kirkcudbright &s;creened Ruther|foord from his per&s;ecutors rage. In 1636, he was obliged by Syd&s;erf, to appear before the high com|mi&s;&s;ion for his non-conformity, and his preaching again&s;t the <HI>articles of Perth,</HI> and writing again&s;t the Arminians. He declined their juri&s;diction as un|lawful

Mr. David Dick&s;on, whom the earl of Eglinton had got re&s;tored to his charge, was on the point of being depo&s;ed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rchbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, for employing Me&s;&s;rs. Blair, Living&s;ton and others, whom the epi&s;copal per&s;ecu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ors had driven from Ireland.</P>
<P>BY this time Laud of Canterbury was deeply concerned to have a perfect conformity e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Scotti&s;h and Engli&s;h churches. He la|boured to per&s;uade the Scotch bi&s;hops to receive the <HI>Engli&s;h liturgy.</HI> But, in their pride, and to avoid all appearance of their dependence on England, they in&s;i&s;ted for a liturgy of their own compo&s;ition, but near to the Engli&s;h in both matter and form. This occa&s;ioned a dryne&s;s between them and the Canter|burian primate. But Charles, advi&s;ed by Laud and his underling bi&s;hops of London and Norwich, took the matter upon him&s;elf. He fixed upon the altera|tions, which he thought proper, and required the Scotch bi&s;hops to frame their <HI>&s;ervice book</HI> according to them, and particularly to retain all the Engli&s;h <HI>&s;aints days,</HI> and add the mo&s;t renowned of Scotland to them, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the royal family or epi&s;|copal order, and by no means to omit Sts. <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Patrick,</HI>&mdash;and to retain the phra&s;e, <HI>receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> in the Rubrick, for ordination;&mdash;and to in&s;ert among the le&s;&s;ons ordinarily read, Wi&s;dom of Solomon, i; ii; iii; iv; v; vi. and Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus i; ii; v; viii; x; xxv; xlix. And he further re|quired, that in all bi&s;hops hou&s;es, univer&s;ities, and
<PB N="108" REF="108">
colleges, this &s;ervice book &s;hould be u&s;ed twice e|very day.</P>
<P>While Maxwel, Syd&s;erf, Wedderburn, Ballantyne, and other bi&s;hops were forming this liturgy, it was fore&s;een, that a <HI>book of canons</HI> would be nece&s;&s;ary to enforce the u&s;e of it. Charles therefore authorized them to compo&s;e one, fal&s;ly pretending, That the &s;ub&s;tance of the acts of the General A&s;&s;emblles could not otherwi&s;e be properly known, as a fixed &s;tan|dard of management. Scarcely had the canons been publi&s;hed, when the whole body of Pre&s;byterians declared again&s;t them, as ob&s;cure or corrupt in many things; and as irregularly impo&s;ed. They particu|larly complained, That the 1&s;t, 12th, and 13th canons, advanced the king's prerogative too high, and left the church intirely at his mercy; that the 2d, 5th, and 15th, urged an implicit &s;ub&s;cription to a <HI>&s;ervice book</HI> or <HI>liturgy</HI> not yet fini&s;hed and publi&s;hed; that the 6th rendered mini&s;ters in part &s;laves to the bi&s;hops; that the 10th laid the innocent and guilty parties on a level in the ca&s;e of divorce; that the 16th &s;eemed to bind to the bidding of prayer, pre|&s;cribed in the 55th. Again&s;t the re&s;t they complain|ed, that bi&s;hops were e&s;tabli&s;hed with ab&s;olute juri&s;|diction, and Popi&s;h idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition revived by them;&mdash;that the whole &s;tructure of their antient and &s;o often ratified church policy was aboli&s;hed; &s;e&s;&s;ions and Pre&s;byteries condemned as conventicles; ruling elders and deacons rejected; and all eccle&s;i|a&s;tical cau&s;es dragged to epi&s;copal tribunals;&mdash;that they contained a number of Popi&s;h terms, as <HI>&s;acra|mental confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olution,</HI>&mdash;appointed all ranks to come to the Lord's &s;upper and <HI>all other &s;acraments</HI>; or contained ambiguous terms, as that mini&s;ters are ordained to urge the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of good works. The liturgy or book of <HI>common prayer,</HI> was at la&s;t fini&s;h|ed. It did not contain &s;o many le&s;&s;ons from the Apocrypha as the Engli&s;h; but tho&s;e which it had were appointed to be read, when the audience was like to be mo&s;t numerous. The p&s;alms of it were

But, in many things relative to al|tars, offering of the elements in the communion, prayer for the dead, mini&s;ters &s;tanding at the altar, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd &s;ometimes turning their face from the people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd with re&s;pect to Chri&s;t's corporeal pre&s;ence in the Euchari&s;t, it approached nearer to the Romi&s;h ma&s;s book than the Engli&s;h had done.&mdash;It was moreover <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oudly complained, that the&s;e books were impo&s;ed without being fir&s;t examined and approved by any General A&s;&s;embly; and that the canons, under pain of excommunication, prohibited all que&s;tioning of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he rectitude of any thing in them.</P>
<P>When Charles and his privy council i&s;&s;ued forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir proclamation for the ob&s;ervance of the&s;e books, &s;ome in&s;i&s;ted for a delay of the execution. But the young bi&s;hops, who had framed them, and Traquair, who, ro ruin them, pu&s;hed them forward, zealou&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y in&s;i&s;ted for immediate obedience to the royal man|date, and the new laws. Notwith&s;tanding the mi|ni&s;ters were urged to compliance in their dioce&s;an Synods, many of them would not &s;o much as pur|cha&s;e the books. The bi&s;hops fal&s;ly repre&s;ented to the council, that the mo&s;t judicious mini&s;ters had all dutifully complied, and obtained an act for rai&s;ing <HI>letters of horning</HI> again&s;t the reluctants, obliging each of them to provide two copies of the <HI>&s;ervice book</HI> for the u&s;e of their pari&s;h, within fifteen days after their charge, under pain of being held rebels again&s;t his maje&s;ty and his laws. But this act was only a tem|porary bug-bear. Zeal for the increa&s;e of their re|venues &s;omewhat diverted the attention of the two archbi&s;hops. Spot&s;wood hoped to draw the tithes and abbey of St. Andrews to him&s;elf; and by ob|taining a locality in each pari&s;h to enrich him&s;elf, and impoveri&s;h the family of Lennox, which had granted lea&s;es of the tithes. His brother of Gla&s;|gow expected to get 5000 pound &s;terling out of the annuities within his dioce&s;e. But, by procuring a royal di&s;&s;olution of the commi&s;&s;ion for valuation of
<PB N="110" REF="110">
tithes, and by other methods, Traquair, to their un&s;peakable vexation, defeated their de&s;igns. They re&s;olved on a journey to court, to complain of his conduct, and to procure redre&s;s to their pur&s;e. And in order to &s;ecure them&s;elves a favourable hearing, they laboured zealou&s;ly to promote the u&s;e of new the liturgy before they &s;et out. They procured a letter from Charles, and an order from his privy council, requir|ing his &s;ubjects in Edinburgh to u&s;e it as a pattern to the re&s;t. Spot&s;wood then conveened the mini&s;ters, and threatened them with immediate &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, if they &s;hould di&s;obey. It &s;eems that all of them pro|mi&s;ed compliance, except Me&s;&s;rs. Andrew Ram&s;ay and Henry Rollock; the immediate &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of whom did but &s;o awaken the indignation of the peo|ple, that they would not allow the re&s;t to comply, however willing they were to do it.</P>
<P>Dean Annan had &s;carce begun to read the &s;ervice in St. Giles' church, when the people began to make a noi&s;e. Bi&s;hop Lind&s;ay ha&s;ted to the pulpit to pa|cify them; but by ca&s;ting of &s;tools and the like at them, both bi&s;hop and dean were in danger of their life. Almo&s;t all the &s;ober people went home, bitter|ly reflecting upon the bi&s;hops, for bringing matters to &s;uch a pa&s;s, by their innovations. The magi&s;trates and privy coun&s;ellors, having driven from the church &s;uch as aimed their blows at the bi&s;hop and dean, the &s;ervice was got performed with &s;hut doors. But Annan, and e&s;pecially the bi&s;hop, was in no &s;mall danger as they went home. Fairlie bi&s;hop of Ar|gyle and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who attempted to introduce the liturgy into the Grayfriars church, had not much better encouragement. I do not find, that it was attempted in any other churches of the city. Not a &s;ingle per&s;on, except the mere rabble, appears to have been concerned in the&s;e tumults. But the bi&s;h|ops and their votaries, to the great grief of the pri|vy council, immediately &s;ent off an expre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, in which they repre&s;ented the citizens a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the authors or actors of all; and complained of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="111" REF="111">
ab&s;ence of Traquair, who had been detained by an heavy rain. After the privy council had made a thorough examination, Traquair, in their name, in|formed Charles, that the whole tumult was owing to the low rabble, e&s;pecially the mo&s;t abject. And, in a letter to the marquis of Hamilton, he laid the blame upon the folly and precipitancy of the bi&s;hops. The town council of Edinburgh wrote a letter to archbi&s;hop Laud, repre&s;enting the innocence of their citizens, and their own readine&s;s to receive the litur|gy; and they offered an additional &s;tipend to &s;uch mini&s;ters as would u&s;e it; and promi&s;ed them and their a&s;&s;i&s;tants protection in &s;o doing. But as none of the conforming clergy inclined to venture their heads on &s;uch terms, the bi&s;hops agreed to &s;u&s;pend the <HI>&s;ervice</HI> till his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure concerning the late tumult &s;hould be known. All &s;acred meetings on week days were dropt in the city, which, having an appearance of a Popi&s;h interdiction, inflamed the people more and more. As both mini&s;ters and ma|gi&s;trates de&s;ired to promote the &s;ervice; and the mi|ni&s;ters offered to read it them&s;elves till decent readers could be found and in&s;tructed, providing that the mini&s;ters in the &s;uburbs and neighbourhood, &s;hould be obliged to do the &s;ame, and that the city &s;hould give a&s;&s;urance for their indemnification, the privy council ordered a bond of a&s;&s;urance to be drawn up, and expeded, and appointed the magi&s;trates to make diligent &s;earch after the authors and abettors of the late tumult, and to provide readers for their church|es. But notwith&s;tanding all their diligence, &s;uffici|ent readers could not be had: and &s;o the &s;ervice was delayed, to the great mortification of Charles and his bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the two archbi&s;hops had done what they could, to promote the <HI>&s;ervice</HI> in the country, and had charged Me&s;&s;rs. Alexander Hender&s;on of Leuchars, and David Dick&s;on of Irvine, and many others, under pain of being immediately denounced rebels, to buy, each of them, two copies of the
<PB N="112" REF="112">
<HI>prayer book</HI> for the u&s;e of their pari&s;hes. Neverthe|le&s;s, not only were readers every where hard to be found, but the reluctant mini&s;ters, in four different petitions, begged the privy council to grant a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the bi&s;hops orders,&mdash;in which they point|ed forth the principal errors of the <HI>Canons</HI> and <HI>Li|turgy,</HI> and offered a friendly di&s;pute on the&s;e points; &mdash;they &s;hewed what bad con&s;equences had, or might attend the introduction of novations and impo&s;ition of liturgies; and that the church had no &s;ecurity at all, if princes might change her antient and innocent forms of wor&s;hip without her con&s;ent; and that his maje&s;ty had bound him&s;elf to make no alterations in this kingdom without the lawful advice and con&s;ent of all concerned. Many noblemen, by their letters, and gentlemen, by per&s;onal &s;olicitation, begged the privy coun&s;ellors to keep that yoke off the neck of mini&s;ters. The council therefore enacted, That <HI>letters of horning</HI> relative to the &s;ervice book, &s;hould extend no further than to the purcha&s;ing of it. They re|pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, that notwith&s;tanding all their endeavours to the contrary, the increa&s;ing op|po&s;ition to his new liturgy, had baffled all their at|tempts to introduce it; and begged that &s;ome of their number might be called up to give him full informa|tion of the critical &s;tate of the nation, in order tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> proper &s;teps might be taken to hu&s;h the commotions&punc; and introduce his liturgy.

<P>During the throng and hard labour of the harve&s;t the country was pretty quiet.

He peremptorily order|ed them, by their pre&s;ence and influence, to cau&s;e it to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Edinburgh without further delay; and that the other bi&s;hops &s;hould introduce it into their dioce&s;es, as had been done in tho&s;e of Ro&s;s and Dumblain; and that the council &s;hould warn all the burghs to choo&s;e none for their magi&s;trates, for who&s;e conformity they could not an&s;wer. Ne|verthele&s;s &s;ixty-eight different remon&s;trances again&s;t the introduction of the <HI>&s;ervice book,</HI> were pre&s;ented to the council, repre&s;enting it as contrary to the reli|gion pre&s;ently profe&s;&s;ed, and as irregularly impo&s;ed, without con&s;ent of the General A&s;&s;embly, and con|trary to acts of Parliament. From all the&s;e, the earls of Sutherland and Wemy&s;s formed one general remon&s;trance, which was &s;ub&s;cribed by a great num|ber of the nobles. Intent upon executing his ma|je&s;ty's directions, the council delayed an&s;wering of the&s;e petitions; but promi&s;ed to acquaint the peti|tioners with his plea&s;ure, a&s;&s;oon as it &s;hould be &s;ig|nified to them. And, by the duke of Lennox, they tran&s;mitted to him the general petition, and another from the city of Gla&s;gow, and a third from the dioce&s;e of Dumblain, in which he alleged the &s;ervice book had been cheerfully received. They al&s;o informed him of their diligence in executing his orders, and appointed Lennox to lay before him a true &s;tate of the circum&s;tances of the nation. Highly offended, that the council would not &s;acrifice their own con|&s;ciences, and the public peace and tranquility for

<P>After thanking the council for their good inclina|tions to redre&s;s their grievances, the petitioners re|turned home, and applied them&s;elves to &s;earch their own ways, and turn to the Lord, by confe&s;&s;ion, pray|er, and humiliation for &s;in,&mdash;to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in which work, Me&s;&s;rs. Hender&s;on, Dick&s;on, and Ker, drew up &s;ome directions. Their numbers mightily in|crea&s;ed. Sir John Hay, the new provo&s;t of Edin|burgh, had hindered the citizens from petitioning along with their brethren.

<P>After &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful addre&s;&s;es to the privy council, the numerous &s;upplicants returned home, having re&s;olved to meet again upon the 15th of No|vember.

Directed by his Maje&s;ty's letter, the coun|cil made three acts, declaring, that he had no inten|tion of altering the <HI>religion pre&s;ently profe&s;&s;ed,</HI> or the <HI>laws of the country;</HI> and appointing two meetings of council every week at Dalkeith, and thereafter at Stirling, of which that on the Thur&s;day &s;hould di&s;|cu&s;s complaints and grievances,&mdash;and appointing the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to meet in the beginning of February next 1038, for the admini&s;tration of civil affairs, which, for almo&s;t a year, had been totally interrupt|ed, or run into confu&s;ion.

Inform|ed of this intended prote&s;tation, the privy coun&s;el|lors promi&s;ed the deputies a hearing of their reque&s;ts upon the 21&s;t of December. The commi&s;&s;ioners therefore appointed the 12 deputies to pre&s;ent their &s;upplication and complaint to the council, and to do every thing nece&s;&s;ary for obtaining a proper an&s;wer to them. They al&s;o agreed upon the ob&s;ervation of a general Fa&s;t, leaving it to mini&s;ters and their &s;e&s;&s;i|ons to fix the time and a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;es of it;&mdash;and advi&s;ed mini&s;ters to &s;hew their people the heinous nature of the late innovations, and how contrary they were to the national covenant, which had been &s;worn about forty years before, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1596; and kindly to warn univer&s;ities again&s;t receiving the &s;er|vice book, or tolerating the teaching of any fal&s;e doctrine among them.</P>
<P>The council having met, and the bi&s;hops with|drawn,&mdash;con&s;i&s;ted only of laymen.

to deal with his maje&s;ty, and to their utmo&s;t endeavour their redre&s;s. He al&s;o pre&s;ented a <HI>decli|nature</HI> of the bi&s;hops as judges in their cau&s;e, &s;ince they had been contrivers, introducers, and urgers of the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>canons,</HI> and authors of their other grievances. He and Mr. Cuningham enforced their &s;upplications with mo&s;t affecting &s;peeches, the la&s;t of which, it is &s;aid, drew tears from &s;everal coun&s;el|lors, and gained Lord Lorn, afterwards Marquis of Argyle, to the Petitioners &s;ide. The council, from con&s;cience or from nece&s;&s;ity, found them&s;elves ob|liged to repre&s;ent the whole matter to his maje&s;ty, and not agreeing whether to depute Roxburgh or Traquair for that purpo&s;e, they left it to Charles to choo&s;e whom he plea&s;ed. After being impo&s;ed up|on by young Spot&s;wood, pre&s;ident of the &s;e&s;ion, and better informed by a letter which Rothes had &s;ent to the earl of Haddington, he called up Tra|quair, who refu&s;ed to look on, or carry along with him, an information from the deputies; but per|mitted Lord Orbi&s;ton, ju&s;tice clerk, one of his at|tendants, to carry it. Pre&s;ident Spot&s;wood had &s;o bia&s;&s;ed Charles, that Traquair had no &s;mall difficul|ty. Stirling, who, by Laud's direction, had kept back part of the information &s;ent by the council, was at la&s;t left in the lurch. In&s;tigated by a letter from old Spot&s;wood the archbi&s;hop, Charles re&s;olv|ed to have all the proceedings of the malecontents condemned, and every thing &s;imilar prohibited un|der pain of high trea&s;on. Traquair repeatedly re|mon&s;trated again&s;t this &s;tep, as calculated to endan|ger the public peace; but he was remanded with new in&s;tructions to the council.</P>
<P>After his return to Scotland, Traquair, to deceive the malecontent deputies, pretended, That he had brought no in&s;tructions relative to their affairs. But they, being informed of the truth by their friends at London, appointed four or five of their number to attend the council at Stirling. Traquair and Stir|ing laboured to di&s;&s;uade them from this, or at mo&s;t
<PB N="121" REF="121">
to &s;end up only two, whom, it &s;eems, Traquair intended to apprehend and impri&s;on in the ca&s;tle. Some of the bi&s;hops friends talking of this, the male|contents re&s;olved to go to Stirling in a body. Tra|quair diverted them from this, and per&s;uaded them to depute only a few. Finding them determined to pro&s;ecute their attempts for the pre&s;ervation of their religion and liberties, he, after informing them that the council was to &s;it at Stirling to-morrow, together with Roxburgh, &s;et out for it a little after midnight, intending to have his maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions approved and proclaimed before any of the deputies could come up. After having, to no purpo&s;e, waited two hours for a <HI>quorum</HI> of the council, they, about ten o'clock forenoon, proclaimed his maje&s;ty's mandates, bear|ing, That he, not the bi&s;hops, was the original cau&s;e of the di&s;puted <HI>canons</HI> and <HI>liturgy;</HI> that he con|demned all conventions of his &s;ubjects in order to form &s;upplications again&s;t the&s;e pious and innocent books, as altogether illegal and &s;editious, and pro|hibited all &s;uch meetings for the future, under pain of rebellion;&mdash;that none &s;hould approach his privy council without &s;pecial allowance; and that &s;uch as had, or were coming up, for any &s;uch purpo&s;e, &s;hould within &s;ix hours depart from Stirling, under pain of high trea&s;on. Informed by his own &s;ervant of the early departure of Traquair and Roxburgh, lord Lind&s;ay and the earl of Hume po&s;ted to Stirling; and were ready with a public notary to prote&s;t again&s;t the king's proclamation, as &s;oon as it was read.&mdash; They further remon&s;trated, That the &s;eeds of &s;u|per&s;tition and idolatry are contained in the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>canons,</HI> and many other novelties incon&s;i&s;tent with the liberties, laws, and religion of this king|dom;&mdash;that they and their con&s;tituents ought to be allowed to accu&s;e the bi&s;hops;&mdash;that the High Com|mi&s;&s;ion court is contrary to the fundamental laws of the nation, and calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h the tyranny of bi&s;hops; that they will not yield to the bi&s;hops as their judges, till they have manife&s;ted their inno|cence

in &s;ome competent court; and that all their meetings and &s;upplications had no other end, but the pre&s;ervation of the purity of religion and of his maje&s;ty's honour, and the liberty of church and &s;tate. The re&s;t of the malecontent commi&s;&s;ioners came up in the afternoon, but could not obtain a copy of the king's proclamation. They refu&s;ed to leave Stirling before the coun&s;ellors promi&s;ed to do nothing fur|ther in their affair; but were &s;carcely gone off, when the treacherous council met, and admitted the bi|&s;hops to judge, and approved his maje&s;ty's procla|mation.</P>
<P>Next morning the deputies waited upon the coun|cil, and &s;o effectually repre&s;ented the impropriety and &s;infulne&s;s of their conduct, as made the earls of Angus and Napier profe&s;s their &s;orrow for their ra&s;h approbation of the king's proclamation, and Sir Tho|mas Hope, his advocate, refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe it. When the proclamation was publi&s;hed at Linlithgow, the prote&s;t taken again&s;t it at Stirling was renewed. When it was read at Edinburgh, &s;ixteen noblemen, with a great number of barons, gentlemen, mini&s;ters and burge&s;&s;es, prote&s;ted again&s;t it, and that they &s;hould have immediate recour&s;e to his maje&s;ty and other competent judges, for redre&s;s of their grievan|ces; that the bi&s;hops &s;hould not be held their lawful judges, till they had purged them&s;elves of the crimes laid to their charge; that no deed of council made in their pre&s;ence, &s;hould be prejudicial to the &s;upplicants; that no danger &s;hould be incurred for di&s;regarding <HI>liturgy, canons, courts, acts,</HI> or <HI>procla|mations,</HI> introduced without, or contrary to, the &s;tanding laws of church or &s;tate; and that no bad con&s;equences of the council's refu&s;ing to hear their remon&s;trances, and redre&s;s their grievances, &s;hould be imputed to them.</P>
<P>Convinced, that Traquair and Roxburgh had but deceived them, in&s;tead of labouring to remove their radical grievances, the malecontents a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh in great numbers, in February 1638, to

After the original bond of 1581, and a li&s;t of many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts of Parliament, which manife&s;ted the &s;everal points to be &s;worn, as commanded, or allowed by the civil laws, they &s;ubjoined the <HI>new Bond,</HI> which alone was to be &s;worn and &s;ub&s;cribed. The earl of Ca&s;&s;ils, Mr. Bailie, and a few others, who had been edu|cated in high notions of his maje&s;ty's prerogatives, or of the lawfulne&s;s of Prelacy, had &s;ome difficulties; but after &s;ome rea&s;oning, and the alteration of a few words, all pre&s;ent agreed to it, except three or four clergymen from Angus. As &s;ome &s;crupled, directly to condemn the <HI>articles of Perth</HI> and other innovati|ons as <HI>unlawful</HI> in them&s;elves, the draught of the covenant bond referred all determination on that point to the fir&s;t free General A&s;&s;embly, and engag|ed the &s;wearers to no more than a <HI>forbearance</HI> of them till that &s;hould take place. By the <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> of the church they meant no more than the &s;ub&s;tantial points of it u&s;ed in 1581. Such as had &s;worn confor|mity to the <HI>novations</HI> introduced, were told, that they might neverthele&s;s engage to forbear the u&s;e of them for a time, on account of their offen&s;ivene&s;s. Such as &s;u&s;pected, that the Bond too much limited the maintenance of the king's authority, were told, that their &s;wearing to maintain his authority in the de|fence of the true religion, and of the laws and liber|ties of the kingdom, did not exclude their mainte|nance of it in other ca&s;es; that in the bond of 1581, they were &s;till more expre&s;ly bound to defend their religion; that they engaged to maintain the king's authority along with their religion, and therefore their defending of one another in the maintenance of religion, was no more than the laws of kingdom re|quired

of them. Some other difficulties were &s;tart|ed, but removed in a friendly manner.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters having, on the preceding Sabbath, repre&s;ented the breach of former covenants with God, as the peculiar &s;pring of all the calamities, under which the nation had groaned; and that the renovation of &s;uch a &s;olemn dedication of them&s;elves to God, was a proper mean of obtaining his favour and help for their deliverance,&mdash;the covenant was &s;worn on the fir&s;t Sabbath of March, with great &s;olemnity, and &s;ub&s;cribed by many thou&s;ands, <HI>viz.</HI> all the nobility, except the privy coun&s;ellors and four or five more; and by commi&s;&s;ioners from all the &s;hires in Scot|land, and commi&s;&s;ioners from all the burghs, except Aberdeen, St. Andrews, and Crail; and by a mul|titude of gentlemen and mini&s;ters. Copies of it were immediately &s;ent to every Pre&s;bytery, along with a demon&s;tration of the lawfulne&s;s of &s;ub&s;cribing it, and directions how it &s;hould be taken in pari&s;hes; and as the clergy of Aberdeen and Gla&s;gow chiefly adhered to their &s;cruples, &s;ome mini&s;ters were ap|pointed to deal with them. Before the end of A|pril, almo&s;t the whole adult per&s;ons in the kingdom, except the Papi&s;ts, who were then about 600, the courtiers, who feared his maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;ome clergymen who had &s;worn the oath of con|formity, had chearfully concurred in the covenant: And notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of their clerical doctors, the mo&s;t of the inhabitants of St. Andrews and Gla&s;gow, al&s;o joined in it. But at Aberdeen, the &s;hrewd rea&s;oning of the doctors, together with the general inclination to Prelacy and &s;uper&s;tition, had no &s;mall influence. We have el&s;ewhere prov|ed, from many authentic vouchers, that there were few adult per&s;ons in Scotland, who did not take the covenant, in one &s;hape or other, that year.</P>
<P>Having thus, under uncommon influence of the Spirit of God, dedicated them&s;elves to him, and be|gun to reform their practice and families, the cove|nanters tran&s;mitted a &s;upplication to his maje&s;ty, re|pre&s;enting
<PB N="125" REF="125">
the equity and legality of their proceedings, and the inju&s;tice of the bi&s;hops, who had oppo&s;ed them; and they be&s;ought the duke of Lennox, mar|quis of Hamilton, and &s;ome other noble courtiers, to interceed with him for a gracious an&s;wer. The privy council al&s;o &s;ent up Lord Orbi&s;ton to inform him of what had happened, and to beg that he would put a &s;top to the <HI>novations</HI> complained of, or at lea&s;t allow the con&s;ciences of his &s;ubjects a fair hearing. Spot&s;wood, deep drowned in debt, and other bi|&s;hops, who knew them&s;elves to be hated by the peo|ple, fled off to the court. Orbi&s;ton, according to his in&s;tructions, faithfully informed his maje&s;ty, and di&s;po&s;ed him to receive further information, for ob|taining of which, Traquair, Roxburgh, and Lorn, were called up to him. The Scotch lawyers being con&s;ulted, Whether the covenanters a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves, without his maje&s;ty's authority, prote&s;t|ing again&s;t his royal proclamations, and entering in|to covenant with God, and with each other, were warrantable by law, gave their opinion, That mo&s;t of their conduct was legal, and none of it again&s;t any expre&s;s law. It was even &s;u&s;pected, that they had walked by the direction of Sir Thomas Hope, the king's advocate, in the mo&s;t critical &s;teps of it. No &s;ooner had the three commi&s;&s;ioners got to London, than the Scotch affairs were taken into &s;erious con&s;i|deration. The bi&s;hops, chiefly of Brechin and Mur|ray, fore&s;eeing that they would be inevitably ruined, if Charles &s;hould incline to clemency, did all that lay in their power to exa&s;perate him to the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures again&s;t the covenanters. The noblemen with great zeal oppo&s;ed them. Lorn candidly laid open all that he knew of the grievances of his coun|try, and declared his di&s;like of the <HI>articles of Perth,</HI> the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>canons,</HI> and of the conduct of the bi|&s;hops; and that he was re&s;olved rather to leave his country, than to concur in binding the&s;e burdens upon his fellow &s;ubjects. As Traquair in&s;i&s;ted for peaceable methods, the bi&s;hops reproached him with
<PB N="126" REF="126">
giving the covenanters intelligence, while he, to a|venge him&s;elf, charged the mi&s;carriage of his maje&s;ty's de&s;igns on their imprudence and violence.&mdash;Fearing that the commencement of a war in Scotland, might give the Engli&s;h malecontents an opportunity of ob|taining their wi&s;hed redre&s;s, the Engli&s;h coun&s;ellors were no le&s;s aver&s;e to it, than the Scotch. Lennox, in a fine and warm oration, remon&s;trated, that there was no pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity for a war; nor were the mo|tives of &s;uch importance, as to plunge the two king|doms into a war, in which, be victorious who would, his maje&s;ty would lo&s;e a multitude of his &s;ubjects, or the hearts of &s;uch as &s;urvived it; and in&s;i&s;ted, that either the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent ferment &s;hould be removed out of the way, or time &s;hould be allowed for it gradually to work off, or his maje&s;ty might yield to the covenanters demands. The&s;e and like &s;peeches, with the news of Multitudes entering into the covenant, made Charles prefer peace, and made the bi&s;hops to be looked upon at the real enemies of the kingdom.</P>
<P>About this time, Pre&s;byteries, di&s;regarding their epi&s;copal &s;uperiors, began to ordain mini&s;ters, with|out con&s;ulting them, and removed their con&s;tant moderators. Rutherfoord returned to Anwoth in Galloway; Living&s;ton, Hamilton, M'Lellan, Blair, and Row, who had been driven from Ireland, were &s;ettled in vacancies, or as a&s;&s;i&s;tants to others. The Epi&s;copalian doctors of St. Andrews publi&s;hed their rea&s;ons for refu&s;ing the covenant, and Drs. Baron and Forbes of Aberdeen commenced a paper war with the covenanters. But both were quickly &s;ilenced by more nervous <HI>replies.</HI> The king's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the civil courts for about a year, tempted &s;ome highlan|ders of his party to plunder and oppre&s;s their neigh|bours, and &s;ome women and low rabble to abu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome conform clergy.&mdash;While the covenanting cler+gy did what they could to prevent or &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch riots, the bi&s;hops and their agents improved them
<PB N="127" REF="127">
to provoke his maje&s;ty to an open war with the whole covenanters.</P>
<P>Charles having re&s;olved for a time to yield &s;ome|thing to them, he was on the point of intru&s;ting that critical management to Traquair: but the bi&s;hops, who reckoned him their mortal enemy, by a long and trifling accu&s;ation, diverted him from this. The Marquis of Hamilton was therefore intru&s;ted with it. To prevent all divi&s;ion of the covenanters among them&s;elves, by any conce&s;&s;ions, which his maje&s;ty might offer, the earls of Rothes, Ca&s;&s;ils and Montro&s;e, drew up a draught of the <HI>lowe&s;t terms,</HI> upon which the religion and liberties of the nation could be &s;ettled in a &s;olid manner, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>&s;ervice book</HI> and <HI>book of canons</HI> &s;hould be di&s;charged; that the <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> court &s;hould be for ever di&s;|&s;olved; that the <HI>articles of Perth</HI> &s;hould not be urg|ed by authority; that no clergymen &s;hould have <HI>vote in Parliament,</HI> without an exact &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the CAVEATS fixed by the General A&s;&s;embly 1600; that no unlawful <HI>articles</HI> or <HI>oaths</HI> &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon Intrants to the mini&s;try; that proper &s;ecurity &s;hould be given for the holding of yearly General A&s;&s;em|blies; and that a Parliament &s;hould be called for the redre&s;s of grievances. To pre&s;erve unity among them&s;elves, the covenanters further agreed, That no an&s;wer &s;hould be given to &s;tate&s;men without com|mon con&s;ent; that a committee &s;hould be cho&s;en out of each table to prepare and manage matters; and that &s;ome gentlemen, mini&s;ters, and burgers, &s;hould meet with the nobles, that it might not be thought they took too much upon them; that all of them &s;hould attend at Edinburgh as appointed; that, to &s;hew their adver&s;aries that their principal &s;trength did not ly in their nobility, fewer of the&s;e &s;hould attend than formerly; that if any proclamation be i&s;&s;ued contrary to the de&s;ign of their former &s;uppli|cations, it &s;hould be an&s;wered by a prote&s;t, contain|ing for &s;ub&s;tance the <HI>eight articles</HI> above mentioned; that if his maje&s;ty prohibit the <HI>canons</HI> and <HI>liturgy,</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="128">
and limit the <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> they &s;hall in&s;i&s;t for the redre&s;s of their other grievances, and none re&s;t content with le&s;s than the &s;aid <HI>eight articles</HI> contain; that the number of commi&s;&s;ioners be doubled again&s;t the time of Hamilton's arrival; that the reports of the &s;ub&s;cription of the covenant be called up from every corner of the kingdom; and that they &s;hould ob&s;erve a &s;olemn <HI>fa&s;t,</HI> to confe&s;s their own &s;ins, and implore God's favour and help at their general mee|ting.</P>
<P>While the bi&s;hops, that remained in Scotland, gave all the information they could again&s;t the cove|nanters to court, Hamilton, having received 28 in|&s;tructions from his maje&s;ty, part of which he was to conceal or avow, as circum&s;tances required, prepar|ed for his journey to Scotland. But, fearing, that his furious countrymen might, by their advice, coun|teract his peaceful attempts in his ab&s;ence, he refu&s;|ed to leave the court, till as many of them as could be &s;pared, were ordered down before him. This was extremely di&s;agreeable to the bi&s;hops, and to pre&s;i|dent Spot&s;wood and Sir John Hay, formerly men|tioned, as they knew them&s;elves to be dete&s;ted at home; and &s;everal of them were in danger of pro|&s;ecutions for debt. No &s;ooner had Hamilton arriv|ed at Edinburgh, than he found, to his great di&s;&s;a|tisfaction, that the covenanters had agreed, that not one of them &s;hould wait upon him without the con|currence of all the re&s;t. Charles, on the other hand, &s;ent &s;ixty barrels of powder, and &s;ome hundred, &s;tands of arms and matches, to be lodged in the ca&s;tle, to be u&s;ed again&s;t them, if his propo&s;als &s;hould not &s;ucceed. Being &s;ecretly landed at Fi&s;herrow, and thence conveyed to Dalkeith, this occa&s;ioned a re|port, that Traquair had brought them to blow up the covenanters, when they &s;hould meet to confer with Hamilton; and his vindication of him&s;elf gave too much ground to &s;u&s;pect his Maje&s;ty's ho&s;tile in|tentions. It was al&s;o reported, that Hamilton, as he pa&s;&s;ed, had ordered the &s;herriffs of Northumber|land
<PB N="129" REF="129">
to have their trained bands in readine&s;s. Nor did he appear capable of clearing him&s;elf. It was al|&s;o reported, that the earls of Huntly, Herreis, A|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ercorn and Winton, intended to march their whole forces to Edinburgh for &s;upporting his maje&s;ty's plea|&s;ure. The covenanters, who, as yet appear to have purcha&s;ed no arms from abroad, let a watch upon the ca&s;tle, that it might not be reinforced or &s;uppli|ed with any thing more than nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The marquis of Hamilton having taken up his lodging at Dalkeith, the privy coun&s;ellors met with him there; all of whom the mini&s;ters &s;erved with an earne&s;t intreaty to &s;ub&s;cribe their <HI>covenant.</HI> The covenanters thinking it neither &s;afe, nor conveni|ent, to attend the privy council at Dalkeith, Hamil|ton, after &s;ome altercation, and a treaty, came to E|dinburgh, where, about 20,000 of them, five or &s;e|ven hundred of whom were mini&s;ters, met him; to|gether with the town council, inhabitants, and an infinity of women and children;&mdash;and old Mr. Wil|liam Living&s;ton welcomed him with a &s;hort addre&s;s. &mdash;In vain each party laboured to find out the &s;ecrets of the other.&mdash;At la&s;t, Hamilton told them, that his maje&s;ty was willing to aboli&s;h the <HI>Canons, Liturgy,</HI> and other grievances, providing they would give up with their covenant. By appointment, Mr. Alexan|der Hender&s;on drew up rea&s;ons again&s;t this, bearing, That it would involve them in perjury before God; &mdash;would imply an acknowledgment of the unlawful|ne&s;s of their covenanting;&mdash;would mark the vile&s;t ingratitude to God, who had &s;ingularly encouraged them in it;&mdash;would deny his commandment binding them to <HI>vow and pay</HI> to him;&mdash;would condemn what|ever like work had been, or might be, tran&s;acted in this church; that they could not give up their cove|nant without the con&s;ent of God and every per&s;on concerned in it;&mdash;that it could not be expected, that their &s;urrender of it would influence their oppo|nents to concur with them in &s;wearing to the &s;ame things by virtue of a new command, but would re|pre&s;ent

them as incon&s;tant, as breakers of their oath, and deniers of their faith, while God was calling them to confe&s;s it. The marquis could obtain no more, than that the body of the covenanters &s;hould retire from Edinburgh, leaving &s;ome deputies to tran&s;act with them in their name.

Chiefly intending to gain time, till his maje&s;ty &s;hould be ready to attack them with the &s;word, Hamilton propo&s;ed to the covenanters, that &s;ince his pre&s;ent in&s;tructions could not content them, he would ride po&s;t to London, and repre&s;ent their ca&s;e, in con&s;equence of which, he hoped quickly to return with more &s;atisfying propo&s;als. Ignorant of his wicked de&s;igns, they reli&s;hed his motion; and be&s;ought him to agent their cau&s;e with his maje&s;ty, and procure them a free A&s;&s;embly and Parliament; and added, that if he did not quickly return, they &s;hould be excu&s;ed, if they took it for a denial of their reque&s;t; that their cau&s;e &s;hould be no wi&s;e hurt by proclamations, or any thing el&s;e, before his re|turn; that in the mean time, no forts &s;hould be re|paired or fortified, or lawful commerce by &s;ea or land interrupted; that none of the bi&s;hops &s;hould repair to court, or, if called up, &s;hould return with, or before him; and that the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>canons</HI> &s;hould be of no force.</P>
<P>To deceive the covenanting commi&s;&s;ioners, and make mo&s;t of them return home, Hamilton pretend|ed to &s;et off for London; but returned next day, when he hoped there would be none to prote&s;t; publi&s;hed a proclamation, probably, drawn up by him&s;elf in his maje&s;ty's name, in which he promi&s;ed
<PB N="132" REF="132">
never to urge the ob&s;ervation of the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>ca|nons,</HI> but in a fair and legal manner; that he intend|ed no alteration of the religion or laws of the king|dom; that he would rectify the High Commi&s;&s;ion by advice of his council; that with the fir&s;t con|veniency he would call a free General A&s;&s;embly and Parliament, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the religion pre|&s;ently profe&s;&s;ed. The earl of Ca&s;&s;ils, Alexander Gib|&s;on laird of Dury, Archibald John&s;ton advocate, John Ker mini&s;ter of Pre&s;tonpans, and James Fletch|er provo&s;t of Dundee, prote&s;ted again&s;t it. Being informed, that the privy council was &s;olicited to ap|prove of this proclamation, the covenanters deliver|ed to the marquis, and every other member, a copy of their rea&s;ons again&s;t the ratification of it, bearing, That it did not di&s;allow or aboli&s;h the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>canons,</HI> but confirmed the proclamation of Febuary 19th, and directly avowed, that they might be le|gally impo&s;ed; that it did not aboli&s;h, but e&s;tabli&s;h the High Commi&s;&s;ion court; that it did not grant any of their reque&s;ts, but condemned their proce|dure as di&s;orderly and criminal; that it gave no ground to hope for freedom from the <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>Perth,</HI> but the contrary; that it altogether concealed the guilt of the bi&s;hops; that it gave no certainty of a free A&s;&s;embly or Parliament; that it did not acknow|ledge the&s;e things, of which they had complained, as innovations or &s;uper&s;titious; but repre&s;ented them as means of confirming religion. But before the coun&s;ellors got the&s;e rea&s;ons, all of them but Lorn and South E&s;k had &s;ub&s;cribed the proclamation, at their own hou&s;es, and atte&s;ted it to be &s;ufficient to content all his maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The di&s;appointed covenanters, after &s;olemn &s;up|plications to God, pre&s;ented to the marquis a com|plaint of the coun&s;ellors approbation of the procla|mation, bearing, That thereby the Lords had, with|out hearing them, condemned their proceedings as criminal, and part of them as trea&s;onable; had con|firmed all the calumnies of their adver&s;aries again&s;t
<PB N="133" REF="133">
them, and ju&s;tified the injuries which they had re|ceived; had &s;topt the cour&s;e of his maje&s;ty's favour toward them, or better information; had provoked him to u&s;e his power again&s;t them as di&s;obedient &s;ub|jects; had prematurely &s;hewed, that they would a&s;|&s;i&s;t his maje&s;ty in executing his threatenings again&s;t them;&mdash;and therefore, they begged them to re&s;cind their act. Moved herewith, the lords never re&s;ted till they got back their act and tore it to pieces. Ha|milton then offered the covenanters a more favour|able proclamation, prohibiting the ob&s;ervance of the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>canons,</HI> and re&s;cinding all acts of council in favours of them, and forbidding the High Com|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;it, till it &s;hould be duly regulated. But as this did not &s;atisfy the covenanters, it was not publi&s;hed. They neverthele&s;s promi&s;ed to behave quietly, till the marquis &s;hould go to London, and inform his maje&s;ty how things &s;tood, and return. Meanwhile, Charles carried on his preparations in England and Ireland, for a warlike inva&s;ion of his native country; and his doctors of Aberdeen did what they could, by publi&s;hing their objections and duplies, to oppo&s;e and di&s;grace the covenanters bond. But the&s;e were &s;o an&s;wered by Me&s;&s;rs. Hender&s;on and Dick&s;on, that a con&s;iderable number in and about Aberdeen, both mini&s;ters and people, &s;ub&s;crib|ed the covenant, notwith&s;tanding all that the doc|tors and earl of Huntly could do to re&s;train them.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of Hamilton's information con|cerning Scotch affairs, Charles, after declaring his own adherence to the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1560, empowered him to cau&s;e all the members of privy council to &s;ub&s;cribe it, together with a <HI>new bond</HI> for the maintenance of its doctrines, and of the king's authority. If they complied, he might call a General A&s;&s;embly, when and where they plea&s;|ed, but, it behoved him to take care, that the bi&s;h|ops &s;hould have power to vote, and one of them be moderator; that he might declare the <HI>articles of Perth</HI> indifferent, and that mini&s;ters &s;hould be ad|mitted,
<PB N="134" REF="134">
as before the late commotions; that he &s;hould re&s;trict the power of bi&s;hops as little as po&s;|&s;ible; and might, if he found proper, publi&s;h the la&s;t mentioned proclamation, and act of council. He had other private in&s;tructions to take care of <HI>prelacy</HI> and <HI>prelates.</HI></P>
<P>Returning to Edinburgh, Hamilton demanded of the covenanters, That all tho&s;e mini&s;ters, that had been &s;u&s;pended by Pre&s;byteries &s;ince January la&s;t, without warrant of their bi&s;hop, &s;hould be reponed in their charges; that all the former moderators of Pre&s;byteries, be reponed in their places; that &s;uch mini&s;ters as have been admitted &s;ince that time, leave their charges; that people re&s;ort to their own church|es; that no mini&s;ters come to the A&s;&s;embly, unle&s;s they be cho&s;en commi&s;&s;ioners; that all the lawful moderators of Pre&s;byteries, be commi&s;&s;ioners; that no lay per&s;on, <HI>i. e.</HI> ruling elder, &s;hould interfere in the choice of commi&s;&s;ioners from Pre&s;byteries; that they &s;hould either give up, or alter their cove|nant; that they &s;hould forbear their meetings in time coming; that mini&s;ters &s;hould have their &s;ti|pends paid, and be &s;ecured in their per&s;ons.&mdash;The covenanters, having an&s;wered the&s;e demands, in a manner that &s;hewed they could not be ea&s;ily im|po&s;ed on, Hamilton reduced them all to two, name|ly, That no lay elders or mini&s;ters of another Pre&s;|bytery, &s;hould vote in the choice of commi&s;&s;ioners to the A&s;&s;embly; and that the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould meddle with nothing which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Parliament, unle&s;s in remon&s;trances and petiti|ons to that &s;upreme court.

<P>Finding, that the covenanters were re&s;olved to have an A&s;&s;embly more free than his in&s;tructions permitted him to call, Hamilton with no &s;mall diffi|culty per&s;uaded them to delay all &s;teps toward calling one them&s;elves, till he &s;hould again po&s;t to London, and &s;olicit his maje&s;ty's concurrence with their views.

As not a few of the clergy were aver&s;e from ruling elders &s;itting with them, in Pre&s;byteries, Synods, or A&s;&s;emblies, co|pies of a paper, proving by a great many acts of A&s;|&s;embly and Parliament, that &s;uch officers had, and ought to be in this church, in order to procure rea|dy acce&s;s for them into Pre&s;byteries. Moreover &s;e|cret in&s;tructions were tran&s;mitted to the more tru&s;ty clergymen, bearing, That they &s;hould prote&s;t again&s;t the choo&s;ing of any for commi&s;&s;ioners, that were under any proce&s;s for &s;candal; that they &s;hould take care to have the bi&s;hops timely brought under pro|ce&s;s for their offen&s;ive behaviour; that mini&s;ters pre|pare them&s;elves for di&s;puting upon &s;uch points as are like to be handled in the A&s;&s;embly; that three mi|ni&s;ters be cho&s;en out of every Pre&s;bytery, where they can be had well affected to the cau&s;e of truth; that the well affected con&s;ult among them&s;elves be|fore the election, that their election may fall on the &s;ame per&s;ons; that the election of &s;uch as have cho|&s;en bi&s;hops, have &s;at in the High Commi&s;&s;ion, have countenanced the king's chapel ceremonies, or have offered to ob&s;erve the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>canons,</HI> or have been ju&s;tices of peace, be avoided, unle&s;s they have acknowledged the &s;infulne&s;s of their former cour&s;es; that where well affected noblemen or gentlemen may be commi&s;&s;ioned as ruling elders in different Pre&s;by|teries, they be cho&s;en in that Pre&s;bytery, in which there are fewe&s;t able mini&s;ters.

<P>While the court laboured to have all the magi&s;trate of burghs to their mind, the elections for the A&s;&s;em+bly went almo&s;t every where in favours of the cove+nanters.

<P>The Tables further advi&s;ed, That all the noble|men who had &s;ub&s;cribed their covenant, &s;hould meet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Gla&s;gow on the Saturday before the A&s;&s;embly; that every ruling elder cho&s;en for the A&s;&s;embly, &s;hould bring along with him four gentlemen as his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, whom he might con&s;ult in difficult ca&s;es; that each burgh &s;hould &s;end up from two to &s;ix of their mo&s;t judicious members for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; that, according to his maje&s;ty's proclamation, the fir&s;t Lord's day of November &s;hould be &s;pent in &s;olemn fa&s;ting in congregations for the Lord's direction, be|fore mini&s;ters &s;et off; that congregations take care, that no mini&s;ter be hindered from attendance, for want of nece&s;&s;ary charges; that &s;uch as had been de|coyed or compelled to &s;ub&s;cribe the king's covenant, declare the &s;ame in writing, or before their &s;e&s;&s;ions. To prevent a numerous attendance of the covenan|ters at the A&s;&s;embly, which might at once protect and encourage their friends, Hamilton and his party did what they could, prohibiting every per&s;on con|cerned to bring any with him but his own family and ordinary retinue. But the covenanters prote&s;ted, That all &s;hould have liberty to attend, who had in|tere&s;t as parties, witne&s;&s;es, judges, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; and that all might come with &s;uch retinue as the privy coun&s;ellors &s;hould give example of.

<P>When the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion met at Edinburgh on the fir&s;t day of November, Hamilton required them to &s;ub&s;cribe his maje&s;ty's covenant, intimating, that his declared meaning of it was con&s;i&s;tent with all the

<HI>novations</HI> introduced into the church &s;ince 1580. But, after a debate of three hours, only nine of them would &s;ub&s;cribe it. The Lords Dury, Craig-hall, Scotstarvet, and Innerteil, refu&s;ed, and pro|te&s;ted. Hamilton declared in the privy council, that it was his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, that Epi&s;copacy might be limited, but not that it &s;hould be aboli&s;hed; and therefore urged them to approve it, as a mean of de|terring the A&s;&s;embly from pre&s;uming to condemn it. But Sir Thomas Hope, lord advocate, &s;o vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this motion in a paper which he &s;ent to the council, that it mi&s;carried. Hamilton, almo&s;t infu|riated, charged Sir Thomas to repair to Gla&s;gow, and there defend Epi&s;copacy for his royal ma&s;ter, as he &s;hould an&s;wer at his peril. But Sir Thomas de|clined it, as a piece of &s;ervice, for which he could not an&s;wer to God and his con&s;cience. Upon which Hamilton prohibited him to go to that place at all. While the covenanters were &s;pending the 4th and &s;ome following days of November in &s;olemn fa&s;ting and prayer for direction in, and ble&s;&s;ing on, the en|&s;uing A&s;&s;embly, as <HI>Charles had appointed</HI> them, his de&s;ign of making war upon them, and forcing them to &s;ubmit to his impo&s;itions, became more and more manife&s;t.

Never had our church an A&s;&s;embly, in which &s;olid &s;en&s;e, &s;trict piety, bold and prudent zeal, and divine di|rection, &s;o remarkably appeared.

Hamilton, Traquair, and Lewis Stewart, who acted as king's advocate, vehemently pled, that the commi&s;&s;ions of the members &s;hould be fir&s;t tried, that &s;o it might appear who had right to vote in the election. But Rothes and Lowdon, with Me&s;&s;rs. Dick&s;on, Hen|der&s;on, and William Living&s;ton oppo&s;ed them, with equal zeal and &s;uperior &s;trength of argument. They pled, That it had been the con&s;tant practice fir&s;t to choo&s;e the moderator; that &s;uch re&s;pect was due to commi&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t of which were, doubtle&s;s, va|lid, as intitled them to vote in the choice of a mo|derator, that &s;o the promi&s;cuous meeting might be gradually formed into an A&s;&s;embly in&s;tructed with regular commi&s;&s;ions; that it belongs to the freedom of an A&s;&s;embly, that commi&s;&s;ioners choo&s;e their mo|derator immediately after the exhibition of their com|mi&s;&s;ion, le&s;t any thing be irregularly tran&s;acted in their pre&s;ence without their con&s;ent; that, in their &s;upplications, they had in&s;i&s;ted, that the matter and manner of a&s;&s;embling &s;hould be judged by the A&s;|&s;embly it&s;elf, which cannot be done till the modera|tor be cho&s;en; and that it would be a wronging of the churches, which had &s;ent up the&s;e commi&s;&s;ion|ers, not to &s;uffer them to embody them&s;elves in an orderly manner.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, after advi&s;ing with the privy coun&s;ellors, the Marquis permitted them to choo&s;e their modera|tor;
<PB N="144" REF="144">
&mdash;but prote&s;ted, That this &s;hould not import his approbation of any commi&s;&s;ion, which he &s;hould find ground to except again&s;t; and that the choice of the moderator &s;hould not prejudge the bi&s;hops of any office or dignity belonging to them. In oppo&s;i|tion to this, Rothes, in name of the commi&s;&s;ioners prote&s;ted, That the Marquis' prote&s;tation &s;hould no wi&s;e hurt any lawful commi&s;&s;ion to be produced, or mar the freedom of the A&s;&s;embly, which was to be fenced in the name of the Son of God; and that no prote&s;t in favours of the bi&s;hops could be admitted; till both they and their claims were tried and allow|ed. Lord Montgomery, in name of the pro&s;ecutors of the bi&s;hops, prote&s;ted, that the Marquis' prote&s;|tation &s;hould not hinder the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of their libel again&s;t them. Hamilton then pled, that a <HI>declinature</HI> which he had received from the bi&s;hops, &s;hould be immediately read. This being refu&s;ed, he in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;ix privy coun&s;ellors &s;hould be allowed to vote as his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, according as they had been directed in his maje&s;ty's letter;&mdash;which was al&s;o refu&s;ed. After both &s;ides became weary of altercation and prote&s;tation, they proceeded to the choice of their moderator. Mr. Bell, an old mini&s;ter of the place, who had opened the A&s;&s;embly as moderator <HI>pro temp,</HI> taking care to put none other on the leet, but &s;uch as were too infirm, be&s;ide the celebrated Mr. Alex|ander Hender&s;on, he was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en, who having anew con&s;tituted the court with prayer, made an hand&s;ome &s;peech for the direction and encourage|ment of his brethren.</P>
<P>Next day the Marquis, &s;upported by Traquair and Lewis Stewart, again un&s;ucce&s;sfully in&s;i&s;ted for the votes of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, which i&s;&s;ued in his new prote&s;t again&s;t the denial, and a counter-prote&s;t by Lowdon in name of the commi&s;&s;ioners to the A&s;&s;embly. For refu&s;ing Hamilton's demand, it was pled, That the A&s;&s;embly was an eccle&s;ia&s;tical meeting of eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers; that no political pre&s;es had any vote in the antient councils; that in the thirty-nine fir&s;t Genera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="145" REF="145">
A&s;&s;emblies of this church, there was not &s;o much as a king's commi&s;&s;ioner pre&s;ent; that after one was in|troduced, he never had more than one vote; that Hamilton's commi&s;&s;ion empowered none but him&s;elf; that as he repre&s;ented his maje&s;ty, the voting of a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors along with him as his equals, would derogate from the royal dignity; that though a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors had a power of rea&s;oning, it behoved to be only after the rea&s;oning of members, and in the way of propo&s;ing doubts.</P>
<P>The election of a clerk coming next upon the car|pet, Hamilton in&s;i&s;ted, that Thos. Sandilands &s;hould officiate for his aged father James, who had been cho&s;en by the A&s;&s;embly 1616. But the votes car|ried it almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly in favours of Archibald John&s;ton advocate, who, for almo&s;t two years, had faithfully &s;erved the covenanters without any reward. Upon enquiry for the regi&s;ters of former A&s;&s;emblies, Sandilands delivered up two volumes, which contain|ed, at lea&s;t part of the acts between 1590, and 1610, together with the minutes of 1616, 1617, and 1618, &s;igned by his father. A&s;&s;oon as it appeared, that no other member knew where any more could be had, John&s;ton their clerk, pre&s;ented four volumes, which contained all the acts from 1560, to 1590, except about 20 leaves, which had been villanou&s;ly cut out by archbi&s;hop Adam&s;on, together with a|nother volume, which contained the acts of that whole period, &s;omewhat abridged. A committee was appointed to examine the&s;e books; and upon an exhibition of 19 marks of their genuinene&s;s, the A&s;&s;embly &s;u&s;tained them as authentic regi&s;ters. Mr. William Scot of Cowpar, afterward produced ano|ther copy of the&s;e old minutes.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the marquis' earne&s;t &s;truggle to have the bi&s;hops <HI>declinature</HI> fir&s;t received, the A&s;|&s;embly proceeded to examine controverted commi&s;|&s;ions; and rejected &s;uch as proceeded on irregular election, or that were not rightly atte&s;ted.

To this the moderator made an hand&s;ome re|ply, in which he thanked his maje&s;ty for what kind|ne&s;s he had &s;hewed, and pointed out what power ci|vil magi&s;trates have with re&s;pect to the church and her A&s;&s;emblies. As they perceived the marquis in|tent upon breaking with, and leaving them, they were at great pains to obviate his pretended &s;cruples with re&s;pect to their commi&s;&s;ion, the freedom of their election, the conduct of the <HI>Tables,</HI> and the power of ruling elders. They &s;hewed him the im|propriety of allowing advocates to plead the cau&s;e of the bi&s;hops at their bar, as it was contrary to the na|ture of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, was not allowed in privy council, and had been refu&s;ed by the A&s;&s;embly 1576. But nothing could retain him. After repeatedly de|claring, that he would not &s;uffer them to judge the bi&s;hops, he, in his own and their name, prote&s;ted, that no act of the A&s;&s;embly &s;hould be binding on any of the &s;ubjects; and in his maje&s;ty's name di&s;&s;olved their meeting and prohibited them to proceed to a|ny bu&s;ine&s;s; but whether under any penalty, none of my credible vouchers inform. Rothes prote&s;ted again&s;t the di&s;&s;olution of the A&s;&s;embly; and that they could not di&s;&s;olve it, till their work was fini&s;h|ed, as it had been called by his maje&s;ty, and con&s;ti|tuted according to the word of God; as his maje&s;|ty's commi&s;&s;ioner had acknowledge&punc; it a lawful court, and &s;at &s;even days in it, and exhibited his maje&s;ty's declaration to be regi&s;tered in the minutes of it; that the continuance of it was nece&s;&s;ary for the ma|ny rea&s;ons contained in their former &s;upplications for it; that their covenant bound them to maintain the privileges which Chri&s;t had left to his church; that
<PB N="148" REF="148">
according to the laws of this church and kingdom, neither the king nor his commi&s;&s;ioner have power to di&s;&s;olve a General A&s;&s;embly; that the A&s;&s;embly had formerly &s;itten, notwith&s;tanding contrary require|ments of court; that to di&s;&s;olve now, after &s;o much preparation and progre&s;s towards redre&s;s of grievan|ces, without fini&s;hing their work, would offend God, and increa&s;e their mi&s;ery; that it was ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary to explain the meaning of the national covenant &s;ub&s;cribed in 1581, and 1590; and there|fore he prote&s;ted, That the A&s;&s;embly bad full power to continue and di&s;cu&s;s the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, for which it had conveened. Me&s;&s;rs. Hender&s;on, Dick&s;on, and others, by their &s;en&s;ible and affectionate &s;peech|es, encouraged their brethren to adhere to their du|ty, and &s;hew them&s;elves as faithful to Chri&s;t as the commi&s;&s;ioner had done him&s;elf to his king's com|mand. Deeply affected hereby, lord Er&s;kine, &s;on to the earl of Mar, with tears begged the A&s;&s;embly's allowance to &s;ub&s;cribe their covenant. Me&s;&s;rs. For|bes and M'Kail mini&s;ters, lately come from Holland, followed his example. Encouraged by this, and con&s;cious of their duty, the whole A&s;&s;embly, except four or five, by a vote, promi&s;ed to continue &s;itting at all hazard, till their bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be fini&s;hed: and immediately after, by another vote, &s;u&s;tained them|&s;elves lawful and competent judges of the bi&s;hops, notwith&s;tanding their declinature and prote&s;tation.</P>
<P>Next day, November 29th, a proclamation &s;ub|&s;cribed by the marquis and mo&s;t of the privy coun&s;el|lors was publi&s;hed over the cro&s;s of Gla&s;gow, pro|hibiting all the members of the A&s;&s;embly, under pain of high trea&s;on, to meet or judge any thing further; and charging them to leave Gla&s;gow within 24 hours; and declaring, that all their acts and deeds po&s;terior to ye&s;terday's di&s;&s;olution &s;hould be held null and void; and prohibiting the &s;ubjects to regard or obey the &s;ame. In an&s;wer to this, Archibald John&s;ton, lord Er&s;kine and others, read the prote&s;tation, which Rothes had given in the day before, as the mind of
<PB N="149" REF="149">
the court. And further prote&s;ted, that they and their brethren had no di&s;loyal de&s;igns; that all ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es of general concern ought to be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, and the peace of the church fully &s;ettled, and its peace and order re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, before the commi&s;|&s;ioners depart; that if the marquis would leave the church and kingdom in &s;uch di&s;order, it &s;hould be lawful for them to continue &s;itting till they had fi|ni&s;hed their work; that this A&s;&s;embly &s;hould be held lawful, and its deeds of equal force with tho&s;e of other free General A&s;&s;emblies; that no bad con|&s;equences en&s;uing upon the hindering or mole&s;ting of the freedom of this A&s;&s;embly &s;hould be imputed to them, but to the bad advice of the bi&s;hops;&mdash;on account of which, they are hereby again &s;ummoned to attend the A&s;&s;embly, hear proof led, and &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon them, according to ju&s;tice. In &s;ine, they prote&s;ted their adherence to all their former prote&s;tations, and left room for extending their paper or rea&s;ons, as they &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary for vindi|cating their procedure.</P>
<P>After the hurry of the proclamation, the A&s;&s;em|bly met, and the moderator recommended to them, as in the &s;ight of God, to behave them&s;elves in the mo&s;t pious, prudent, peaceable, and orderly man|ner, an&s;werable to their circum&s;tances. Lord Lorn <HI>i. e.</HI> Argyle, came back, and being de&s;ired by the moderator to countenance them, and witne&s;s the rectitude of their procedure, he promi&s;ed to do &s;o, and begged them to proceed wi&s;ely, with the utmo&s;t deference due to their &s;overeign. Some at fir&s;t look|ed upon him as a court &s;py and check upon them; but it &s;oon appeared, that he acted from an hearty love to Chri&s;t and his cau&s;e. About the &s;ame time, the earls of Wigton, Kinghorn, Galloway, Mar, and lord Napier, privy coun&s;ellors, joined the covenan|ters, which not a little encouraged the A&s;&s;embly. To wipe off the reproaches which had been ca&s;t up|on them, in the bi&s;hops declinature, Me&s;&s;rs. Blair, Living&s;ton, Hamilton, and M'Lellan, who had been
<PB N="150" REF="150">
driven from Ireland, &s;hewed that it had been mere|ly for their adherence to the doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;|cipline, and government of the church, &s;worn to in the late covenant. And Me&s;&s;rs. Dick&s;on, Ruther|foord, and the laird of Earl&s;toun, who had been cen|&s;ured by the High Commi&s;&s;ion, repre&s;ented their ca&s;e to the full &s;atisfaction of the whole A&s;&s;embly. On that day, and the next, committees were ap|pointed to enquire into the original &s;en&s;e of the na|tional covenant;&mdash;to prepare matters for the trial of the bi&s;hops;&mdash;to con&s;ider the new liturgy and ca|nons;&mdash;and to form an act nullifying the A&s;&s;emblies 1606,&mdash;1618.</P>
<P>After the moderator had largely &s;hewed the intrin|&s;ic power of the church, particularly in admini&s;tering di&s;cipline to her &s;candalous members, and Me&s;&s;rs. Dick&s;on and Ram&s;ay had &s;hewed the error and wic|kedne&s;s of the Arminian tenets, the A&s;&s;embly pro|ceeded to di&s;cu&s;s &s;ome ca&s;es of &s;candal, which had been referred to them. Mr. Mitchel, being proved chargeable with Arminian errors, and glorying in them; and with procuring an order by the bi&s;hops means for &s;topping his trial before his Pre&s;bytery; and with declining this A&s;&s;embly, was depo&s;ed and excommunicated. Dr. Panther being proved guilty of approaches towards the Popi&s;h doctrine of ju&s;tifi|cation by works, and towards the Pelagian, in deny|ing original &s;in; and of propagating Arminian er|rors, was referred to a committee, which depo&s;ed him. Dr. Glad&s;tones, being proved guilty of drun|kenne&s;s and Athei&s;tical profanene&s;s, was depo&s;ed. When the trial of the bi&s;hops came on, it was prov|ed again&s;t them all, That they had trampled on the CAVEATS of the A&s;&s;embly 1600;&mdash;had accepted con&s;ecration to their epi&s;copal office; and oppre&s;&s;ed the church with innovations. Again&s;t Spot&s;wood archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, it was further proved, that he had been an ordinary profaner of the Lord's day, playing at cards or dice in the time of public wor&s;hip, or riding through the country the whole
<PB N="151" REF="151">
day; that he &s;ometimes &s;at tippling in taverns till midnight; that he had fal&s;ified the acts of the A|berdeen A&s;&s;embly; and was an avowed reproacher of our old A&s;&s;emblies and national covenant; and it was further undertaken to prove him guilty of adul|tery, &s;acrilege, and frequent &s;imony. Again&s;t Syd|&s;erf of Galloway, it was proved, that he had taught Arminian errors; that he had kept a crucifix in his clo&s;et, and defended the u&s;e of it from his own comfortable experience; that, at his own hand, he had appointed two anniver&s;ary fa&s;ts in his dioce&s;e; that, at his Synod, he had compelled mini&s;ters to receive the communion upon their knees; that, for mere non-conformity to <HI>novations,</HI> he had depo&s;ed and procured the bani&s;hment of the mo&s;t eminent mini&s;ters, and had confined or fined &s;undry gentle|men; that he had &s;hewed kindne&s;s to excommuni|cated Papi&s;ts; that he had condemned family pray|ers; that he had profaned the Lord's day, buying hor&s;es, and tran&s;acting other &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s on it. Again&s;t Whiteford of Brichen, it was proved, that he had been guilty of &s;everal acts of adultery and ex|ce&s;&s;ive drinking; that he had u&s;ed a crucifix in his clo&s;et; that he had preached Arminian and Popi&s;h errors; and that he was generally infamous for &s;eve|ral other crimes. Again&s;t Lind&s;ay of Edinburgh, it was proved, that he had violently urged the late innovations; that he had refu&s;ed to admit &s;uch to the mini&s;try, as would not fir&s;t take the order of <HI>preaching deacons;</HI> that he u&s;ed to bow towards the altar, and wear the rochet; that he had domineered over Pre&s;byteries, allowed clande&s;tine marriages, and countenanced corrupt doctrines; that he had lifted up the elements in the Lord's &s;upper at the con&s;e|cration, and laboured to prove that Chri&s;t's man|hood was omnipre&s;ent. He might al&s;o have been proved guilty of profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, and of avowed neglect of lecturing. Again&s;t Ballantyne of Aberdeen, were proved frequent acts of &s;imony, violent pre&s;&s;ing of the <HI>liturgy</HI> and <HI>canons,</HI> &s;u&s;pending
<PB N="152" REF="152">
of mini&s;ters for fa&s;ting on the Lord's day, and or|dering all fa&s;ts to be held on Wedne&s;days: and that he had, in the Popi&s;h manner, con&s;ecrated the cha|pel of the infamous lady of Wardhou&s;e; and that he had &s;topped proce&s;&s;es again&s;t Papi&s;ts and ince&s;tuous per&s;ons. Again&s;t Maxwel of Ro&s;s, it was proved, that he had publicly read the <HI>liturgy</HI> in his own hou&s;e and cathedral; that he bowed towards the altar; that he depo&s;ed faithful mini&s;ters, and admitted known fornicators to the Lord's table; that he was a familiar companion of Papi&s;ts, and an ordinary player of cards and dice on the Lord's day, and once upon a communion Sabbath; that he had often ad|mini&s;tered Popi&s;h ab&s;olution to &s;ick per&s;ons; that he had con&s;ecrated preaching deacons; that he had robbed his va&s;&s;als of above 40,000 merks; that he kept &s;uper&s;titious fa&s;ts every Friday; that he ordinari|ly &s;et off on his journies on the Lord's day; and that he had been a principal in&s;trument of all the trouble which had lately befallen the church and nation. Again&s;t Wedderburn of Dumblain, it was proved, that he had been a principal compiler of the <HI>liturgy,</HI> and practi&s;er and urger of it, and other <HI>innovations;</HI> that he had been an a&s;&s;i&s;tant of arch|bi&s;hop Laud, and a propagator of Arminian errors. Again&s;t Lind&s;ay archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, it was prov|ed, that he had urged mini&s;ters to ob&s;erve the <HI>litur|gy</HI> and <HI>canons</HI> under pain of horning; that he had oppre&s;&s;ed his clergy with his exactions, and kept &s;ome of them altogether out of their &s;tipends; that he had &s;old the office of commi&s;&s;ary, that he had greatly oppre&s;&s;ed his va&s;&s;als; and that he had im|po&s;ed oaths of his own invention upon candidates for the mini&s;try. The&s;e eight were depo&s;ed from all power in the church, and &s;ummarily excommuni|cated, and delivered over to Satan. Again&s;t Graham of Orkney it was proved, that he had tyrannically domineered over his clergy; that he had openly pro|faned the Lord's day by curling on the ice; that he had dilapidated part of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues to
<PB N="153" REF="153">
his friends; that he overlooked adulterers and char|mers; that he neglected preaching him&s;elf, and withheld from mini&s;ters a part of their &s;tipends for the building of his cathedral. Again&s;t Guthry of Murray it was proved, that he had avowed confor|mity to the Engli&s;h Popi&s;h ceremonies; that at his daughter's marriage he had danced in his &s;hirt; that he had conveyed &s;ome women barefooted to a chapel, in order to do Popi&s;h penance; that he ordinarily rode about on the Lord's day, and had &s;aid, that he would borrow a part of that from God, and make it up &s;ome other way. Again&s;t Fairly of Argyle, it was proved, that he had urged wicked oaths up|on intrants to the mini&s;try, and the ob&s;ervance of the liturgy; that he had oppre&s;&s;ed his va&s;&s;als; and that he had preached Arminian errors, and had pro||faned the Lord's day. The&s;e three, together with Campbel of the I&s;les, were depo&s;ed from all power and function in the church, with certification, that they &s;hould be excommunicated, if they did not &s;pee|dily manife&s;t their repentance. Lind&s;ay of Dun|keld, and Abernethy of Caithne&s;s, though little bet|ter than their brethren, having &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the A&s;&s;embly, were only depo&s;ed from their preten|ded power of ruling over other mini&s;ters, and repre|&s;enting the church in Parliament, and &s;u&s;pended from the mini&s;try, with certification, that if they did not &s;ubmit to this cen&s;ure, they &s;hould be ex|communicated. A number of inferior clergymen were al&s;o tried and cen&s;ured for their &s;candalous be|haviour, part of it &s;o gro&s;s, as to be a reproach to hu|manity it&s;elf. Others were remitted to their Pre&s;by|teries, or to committees appointed by the A&s;&s;embly, by which they were &s;u&s;pended or depo&s;ed, as was reckoned mo&s;t ju&s;t and expedient.</P>
<P>In their intervals of cen&s;uring work, the A&s;&s;embly carried forward their other bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;ix A&s;|&s;emblies of 1606, 1608, 1610, 1616, 1617, 1618, which king James had packed and governed by his own will, were declared to have been no courts of

Chri&s;t, but null and de&s;titute of all authority. Up|on this the moderator ob&s;erved, that all tho&s;e that had entered to the mini&s;try under bi&s;hops, were now freed from their oath of conformity; that Pre&s;byte|ries did well in ca&s;ting off the bi&s;hops authority as early as po&s;&s;ible; and that it was now their duty to &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made them free. After Mr. Dick&s;on and lord Lowdon had largely &s;poken to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, an act was made, declaring the oaths impo&s;ed by the bi&s;hops upon Intrants to have been <HI>null</HI> and <HI>void</HI> from the beginning; that the power of Pre&s;byteries had been unju&s;tly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and therefore it was mo&s;t lawful for them to re&s;ume it, and to choo&s;e their modera|tors, and cen&s;ure, and admit to the mini&s;terial of|fice, or a &s;eat in the Pre&s;bytery, according to ju&s;tice. That &s;ame day, large tracts which had been formed again&s;t the <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> the <HI>formula of cleri|cal ordinations,</HI> and the <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> were read; and all the four condemned. They condemned the <HI>Liturgy</HI> or <HI>book of common prayer,</HI> becau&s;e it was de|vi&s;ed, and introduced, and pre&s;&s;ed by the bi&s;hops, without any direction or warrant from the church; becau&s;e it contained a Popi&s;h form of divine &s;ervice, and many Popi&s;h errors and ceremonies, the &s;eeds of manifold and gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry, and &s;o repugnant to the doctrine, di&s;cipline, and order of this church, and to the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, national covenant, and acts of A&s;&s;embly and Parliament e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the true religion. They condemned the <HI>book of canons,</HI> as devi&s;ed by the bi&s;hops without any warrant and direction from the church, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h their own tyrannical power over the wor&s;hip of God, and the con&s;ciences, liberties, and goods of men, and to overthrow the whole government of the church by A&s;&s;emblies, Synods, Pre&s;byteries, and Se&s;&s;ions, e&s;tabli&s;hed by her confe&s;&s;ion and con&s;titu|tions. They condemned the <HI>book of con&s;ecration and ordination,</HI> as introduced without any civil or eccle|&s;ia&s;tical warrant; as e&s;tabli&s;hing offices in God's
<PB N="155" REF="155">
hou&s;e without warrant of his word; as repugnant to the di&s;cipline and con&s;titutions of this church; as hindering faithful men from the mini&s;try, or from fulfilling the duties of it. They condemned the <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> as erected without the con&s;ent of either church or &s;tate; as &s;ubverting the ordinary judicatories of the church; as arbitrary, and not re|gulated by any laws; as mingling the civil and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical power, and &s;o as unlawful in it&s;elf, and prejudicial to the liberties of the church, and the king's honour in maintaining them.</P>
<P>The national covenant having been lately taken in <HI>three different &s;en&s;es,</HI> Argyle and others intreated, that they would &s;peedily manife&s;t the original mea|ning of it. From many old acts of A&s;&s;embly, in fa|vours of parity among mini&s;ters, and again&s;t Epi&s;|copacy, it was found evident, that Prelacy was con|&s;idered about 1581 and 1589, as a branch of the Romi&s;h hierarchy abjured in the national covenant; and therefore ought to be removed out of the church. Though about fifty members did not add the word <HI>abjured</HI> in their vote, yet only Mr. Bailie plainly manife&s;ted his doubt of all kind of Prelacy being renounced in that oath.&mdash;The A&s;&s;embly al&s;o, by comparing them with the word of God and old acts of A&s;&s;embly, found the <HI>articles of Perth</HI> to be abjured by the covenant 1581, and 1589; and therefore to be removed.</P>
<P>In their 23d and 24th &s;e&s;&s;ions, the A&s;&s;embly re|vived old, or framed new acts for promoting of re|formation among all ranks. They revived the act of 1596, relative to the <HI>corruptions</HI> of mini&s;ters, and <HI>re|medies</HI> of them, They approved the erection of &s;ome Pre&s;byteries, and erected others in Argyle&s;hire. They appointed that Pre&s;byteries be holden weekly; and that an exerci&s;e and additions be given in, and an exege&s;is exhibited and &s;u&s;tained at each; that Pre&s;byteries vi&s;it all the congregations in their bounds once every year, and examine how family wor&s;hip is ob&s;erved, and take care, that the youth be diligently

in&s;tructed; that &s;chools and colleges be vi&s;ited, and the orthodoxy, ability, and regularity of conver&s;ation of the ma&s;ters, tried; that no mini&s;ter be ab&s;ent from his congregation above 40 days in a year, with|out &s;pecial liberty; that &s;chools be planted in land|ward places, and the teachers catechi&s;e the common people; that Pre&s;byteries have the whole power of admitting mini&s;ters, and choo&s;ing their own mode|rators; that the Lord's &s;upper be more frequently admini&s;tered; that, in ordinary ca&s;es, mini&s;ters be 25 years of age before they be ordained; that burghs take proper care to change their markets, which are on Monday or Saturday, to &s;ome other day of the week; that the Lord's day be carefully &s;anctified; that there be afternoon &s;ermons in country pari&s;hes; and that Pre&s;byteries take care to have the <HI>old acts</HI> a|gain&s;t going of mills, &s;alt pans, or fi&s;hing of &s;almon, on that day, duly executed:&mdash;that ob&s;tinate frequen|ters of the company of excommunicated per&s;ons be excommunicated; that &s;uch as &s;peak or write again&s;t the late covenant of this A&s;&s;embly or its acts, be cen|&s;ured; that all Popi&s;h titles of <HI>abbots, priors, deans,</HI> or other eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity, be aboli&s;hed; that none be admitted into any office of <HI>pa&s;tor, reader,</HI> or <HI>teacher,</HI> contrary to the will of the congregation, to which they are appointed; that no marriages be ce|lebrated without due proclamation of banns; that funeral &s;ermons be di&s;u&s;ed, as &s;avouring of &s;uper&s;ti|tion; that the abilities and practice of candidates for the mini&s;try be carefully examined; that Pre&s;byte|ries take care to excommunicate &s;uch mini&s;ters as ac|quie&s;ce not in le&s;&s;er cen&s;ures inflicted by this A&s;&s;em|bly.&mdash;They al&s;o fixed a plan of 14 Synods, and a&s;|&s;igned &s;ix Pre&s;byteries to the Synod of Mer&s;e and Teviotdale; &s;ix to that of Lothian; four to that of Dumfries; three to that of Galloway; two to that of Air; five to that of Gla&s;gow; five to that of Ar|gyle; five to that of Stirling; four to that of Fife; four to that of Angus; &s;even to that of Aberdeen; three to that of Ro&s;s; three to that of Caithne&s;s;

two to that of Orkney; &s;ix to that of Murray; and appointed their fir&s;t meetings on particular days of A|pril next; and that they &s;hould all maintain a corre&s;|pondence with their next neighbours, and for that purpo&s;e &s;end one or two commi&s;&s;ioners to their meet|ings.&mdash;It is &s;carcely worth while to mention the tran&s;|portations reque&s;ted at this A&s;&s;embly, as of Mr. Dick|&s;on to Gla&s;gow; of Mr. Cant to Pit&s;ligo; of Me&s;&s;rs. Sharp and Hamilton to Pai&s;ley; of Mr. Douglas to Kirkaldy; and of Blair and Rutherfoord to St. An|drews. The two la&s;t warmly oppo&s;ed their own re|moval; nor would Rutherfoord at all accept of the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of divinity, without a congregation to which he might preach Chri&s;t. But, to <HI>prevent tran&s;|portation</HI> for the future, as much as po&s;&s;ible, it was re|commended to Pre&s;byteries to &s;ettle Me&s;&s;rs. David Cal|derwood, James Guthry, and about &s;ixty-eight others, who, in the late times, had been denied admi&s;&s;ion, and driven from their charges.</P>
<P>Next day the A&s;&s;embly condemned all <HI>civil power</HI> of mini&s;ters. They agreed to petition the Parlia|ment for a ratification of their acts. They a&s;&s;erted the divine right of ruling elders. Upon Dec. 20th, in their la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, they enacted, That none &s;hould print any thing relative to the church, without a li|cence from their clerk; that Pre&s;byteries and Synods &s;hould cen&s;ure &s;uch mini&s;ters as were &s;candalous, or would not acknowledge this A&s;&s;embly, and &s;ubmit to its requirements. They approved the late <HI>natio|nal covenant,</HI> and required all mini&s;ters, ma&s;ters of univer&s;ities, colleges, and &s;chools, and others, who had not &s;ub&s;cribed it, to take it &s;peedily, as abjuring <HI>Prelacy,</HI> the <HI>articles of Perth,</HI> and the <HI>civil places</HI> and <HI>power</HI> of mini&s;ters; and prohibit the taking of it in any other &s;en&s;e. They a&s;&s;erted the intrin&s;ic power of the church, and the divine, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil warrant of the General A&s;&s;embly to meet once every year, or oftener, as her nece&s;&s;ities require. They appointed their next meeting at Edinburgh on the 3d Wedne&s;day of July next; but required Pre&s;|byteries

rather to keep the king's diet, if he &s;hould appoint one. They formed a &s;upplication to his ma|je&s;ty, vindicating their conduct, and imploring his approbation and concurrence. They appointed the marvellous kindne&s;s of God towards them to be thankfully commemorated in their &s;everal congrega|tions and Pre&s;byteries, after their return home; and that they &s;hould read the acts of A&s;&s;embly to their congregations on the fir&s;t Sabbath, and on the next ob&s;erve a &s;olemn <HI>thank&s;giving</HI> to God. After an excellent &s;peech by the Moderator, in which he ex|horted all pre&s;ent to con&s;ider, and be thankful for the Lord's goodne&s;s to them, and to manife&s;t their gratitude to his maje&s;ty in earne&s;t prayer for him and con&s;cientious obedience to him; he was &s;econded by Me&s;&s;rs. Dick&s;on and Ram&s;ay;&mdash;and Argyle, de&s;ired by the Moderator, repre&s;ented their deep obligation to a careful performance of their duty toward &s;upe|riors, inferiors and equals. After concluding with prayer, the moderator added, Now we have ca&s;t down the walls of Jericho, let him, who rebuilds them, beware of the cur&s;e of Hiel the Bethelite.</P>
<P>On the 18th of December, a royal PROCLAMA|TION was read over the cro&s;s of Edinburgh, extol|ling his maje&s;ty's conde&s;cen&s;ion; vindicating the conduct of the marquis of Hamilton his commi&s;&s;io|ner, and charging the covenanters with many di&s;or|derly and di&s;loyal practices, in guarding the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, &s;topping importation of warlike ammu|nition to his maje&s;ty's hou&s;es, carrying arms with them to the Gla&s;gow A&s;&s;embly, contrary to his proclama|tion; and citing his privy coun&s;ellors to an&s;wer to him and his Parliament for their &s;ub&s;cription of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> late proclamation at Gla&s;gow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In their PRO|TEST, read in an&s;wer to this, the covenanters re+plied, That they had done nothing to the ca&s;tle o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Edinburgh, but watched it in order to prevent thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> own danger; that, by the laws of the land and max+ims of all nations, the public &s;afety is the &s;uprem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> law, and the end of all lawful power; that, by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

laws of the land, all fortifications are to be kept for the welfare of the &s;ubjects, as well as for his maje&s;ty's behoof; that they had carried arms to Gla&s;gow to defend them&s;elves from the outlawed clan Gregors, who ju&s;t before had ravaged the country about,&mdash;and had but followed the example of his maje&s;ty's com|mi&s;&s;ioner and his attendants; that, according to law, coun&s;ellors, who had given bad coun&s;el, ought to be pro&s;ecuted before proper judges, civil or eccle|&s;ia&s;tical. They further &s;hewed, that the prohibiti|on of obedience to the acts of A&s;&s;embly, and a&s;&s;u|rance of protection in di&s;obedience to them, contain|ed in the <HI>proclamation,</HI> were contrary to &s;cripture,&mdash; the practice of the primitive church,&mdash;the civil and canon law,&mdash;the law of nations,&mdash;the acts of former faithful A&s;&s;emblies,&mdash;and to the large confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and national covenant.</P>
<P>After the A&s;&s;embly, the court party appeared more and more furious. The old college of Aber|deen threatened Mr. Lundy their commi&s;&s;ioner with deprivation, becau&s;e he had continued in the A&s;&s;em|bly, after it was di&s;&s;olved in his maje&s;ty's name. They agreed to &s;hut their gates again&s;t the Commit|tee, which the A&s;&s;embly had appointed to vi&s;it their univer&s;ity, and that no member &s;hould acknowledge their power under pain of deprivation. The mar|quis of Huntly publi&s;hed the king's proclamation of Dec. 18th, and declared his re&s;olution to keep the country for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. The town council put their city into a po&s;ture of defence. Before Ha|milton &s;et off for London, in the beginning of Janu|ary 1639, &s;ome principal covenanters waited upon him, and be&s;ought him to interceed with his maje&s;|ty in their favours; but he an&s;wered them with threats of a &s;peedy execution of royal vengeance upon them. They neverthele&s;s tran&s;mitted their &s;uppli|cation to Charles him&s;elf, who received it with the utmo&s;t contempt, but &s;till di&s;gui&s;ed his warlike in|tentions, being not fully prepared to execute them. He meant to invade them with 60,000 forces from
<PB N="160" REF="160">
England and Ireland. But the Papi&s;ts and high fly|ing Epi&s;copalian clergy were almo&s;t the only willing contributers towards the charge. Scotchmen at court were required to abjure the late covenant and A&s;&s;embly, and to &s;wear, that they would a&s;&s;i&s;t his maje&s;ty again&s;t their country, whenever he &s;hould require them. Under pretence, that the Scots were arming to invade and extirpate Prelacy from England, Charles, on January 26th, i&s;&s;ued forth a proclama|tion, requiring all the Engli&s;h nobility and gentry to attend his &s;tandard at York; and appointed Huntly his lieutenant general for rai&s;ing of forces in Scot|land. Meanwhile, the covenanters proceeded in re|forming the country from wickedne&s;s, and in cen|&s;uring the &s;candalous. To vindicate them&s;elves, they carefully di&s;per&s;ed a paper through England, di|rected to all good Chri&s;tians there. Highly enraged at the due credit which it obtained, the Scotch bi|&s;hops in&s;tigated Charles to emit a proclamation, de|claring all the covenanters <HI>traitors</HI> and <HI>rebels,</HI> to be read from all the pulpits in England. The an&s;wer of the covenanters to it, which was al&s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed through England, rendered them more and more pitied, and their enemies proportionally abhorred.</P>
<P>Being at la&s;t fully convinced of Charles' intentions to attack them in war, they &s;tudied to have the law|fulne&s;s of taking up arms in their own defence fully cleared to their own con&s;ciences, as well as to the world. Mr. Bailie and the earl of Ca&s;&s;ils for a time much doubted, if it was lawful to re&s;i&s;t their &s;ove|reign, in a forcible manner. But Mr. Hender&s;on, by appointment, drew up a paper, which &s;olved their &s;cruples, and vindicated &s;uch conduct. Some mov|ed, that they &s;hould &s;upplicate a&s;&s;i&s;tance from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> French, Swedes or Dutch; but others doubting o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the propriety of confederacies with Lutherans, and much more with Papi&s;ts, they re&s;olved, by the help of God, to &s;tand by them&s;elves. Only they agree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;upplicate the French king, the States General
<PB N="161" REF="161">
the Prince of Orange, Queen of Sweden, and King of Denmark, to interceed with their own &s;overeign, that he would grant their reque&s;ts a fair and unbia&s;&s;ed hearing; which, had they done, it would have pre|vented much reproach of them in the nations around. Meanwhile, they earne&s;tly prepared for their own warlike defence. While general Le&s;ly invited home the Scotch officers from the Swedi&s;h army in Ger|many, and procured military &s;tores from Holland, Atgyle laboured to &s;ecure the peace of the North, and to fix as many as he could in the covenanters intere&s;t. But Huntly, his brother-in-law, was too much in the bi&s;hops, if not the Pope's intere&s;t, to attend their meeting when de&s;ired.</P>
<P>The danger of the covenanters was exceedingly alarming. The Scotch mariners, travellers and mar|chants in England and Ireland, were every where treated as rebels; their goods &s;eized, and their per|&s;ons impri&s;oned, unle&s;s they abjured the late nation|al covenant and Gla&s;gow A&s;&s;embly. The king's ar|my at York increa&s;ed fa&s;t. The marquis of Huntly and earls of Airly and Southe&s;k, and the citizens of Aberdeen, began to take arms, and threaten the covenanters in the&s;e parts with immediate de&s;truc|tion. In the &s;outh, the marquis of Douglas, lords Nith&s;dale, Herreis, and their followers, and tho&s;e of the marquis of Hamilton had, or were taking arms for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The earls of Galloway, Dumfries, Traquair, Roxburgh, Queen&s;berry, and the vi&s;count of Dalziel were &s;u&s;pected of an inclination to join them; and that, by the influence of Hamilton and others, the citizens of Gla&s;gow would be made to do the &s;ame. The earl of Antrim was preparing to tran&s;port hither ten or twelve thou&s;and of his Iri&s;h countrymen, probably mo&s;t of them cruel and mur|derous Papi&s;ts. Many of the Scotch M'Donalds had gone to join them, in hopes of robbing Argyle of Kintyre, as they returned. Hamilton conducted his maje&s;ty's navy for the firth of Forth, while he him|&s;elf brought northward the main army by land.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="162">Notwith&s;tanding all, the covenanters levied and trained their troops the be&s;t way they could. God delivered into their hand the &s;trong ca&s;tles of Edin|burgh and Dumbarton, without a &s;ingle drop of blood. Nor did the&s;e of Strathaven, Douglas, Tan|tallon, and Brodick co&s;t much more. In&s;tigated by Montro&s;e and Mar&s;hal, about &s;even or eight thou|&s;and, northward of the Tay, took arms, with whom Montro&s;e obliged the Aberdonians to &s;urrender their city, and obliged Huntly to &s;wear the covenant, as directed by the A&s;&s;embly, and to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners to concur with the other covenanted deputies at Edinburgh, in &s;upporting the common cau&s;e. Hav|ing fortified Leith, and put the country into a po&s;|ture of defence, the covenanters once and again, but without &s;ucce&s;s, attempted to &s;upplicate his maje&s;ty's friend&s;hip.&mdash;Meanwhile, providence marvellou&s;ly interpo&s;ed in their favours. Five or &s;ix thou&s;and Walloons and Iri&s;h, coming over again&s;t them, were by the Dutch admiral driven back to Dunkirk, which then pertained to England. The tyranny of Straf|ford, lieutenant of Ireland, rendered it un&s;afe to &s;end over any more than about 1500 ragamuffins, good for little el&s;e, but theft, robbery, and murder. Mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h either declined &s;erving in the in|va&s;ion, or were very unhearty in it. The Pope re|quired his votaries to withhold their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, unle&s;s upon condition of a &s;ecured open liberty for their religion. Contrary winds detained Hamilton's fleet till Huntly and his faction were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the covenanters had got mo&s;t of their warlike &s;tores im|ported from abroad.</P>
<P>Hamilton, at la&s;t arriving in the Forth, tran&s;mit|ted to the town council of Edinburgh, the king's proclamation, declaring them all <HI>traitors,</HI> who did not within eight days &s;ubmit to his will; and di&s;|poning their e&s;tates to their &s;uperiors or va&s;&s;als, that &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them,&mdash;to be publi&s;hed over their cro&s;s: If ready obedience was not given,

Charles had appointed him to pro&s;ecute them with fire and &s;word. The council begged to be excu&s;ed from publi&s;hing this proclamation till the E&s;tates of Parliament, which were to meet in a few days, &s;hould con&s;ider it. Meeting upon May 9th, they found, that as the proclamation was written and printed without the kingdom, and not warranted by the privy council, and was of &s;o dangerous con&s;equence, it could not be legally publi&s;hed; that by the laws of the land, no trea&s;on or forfeiture of life or e&s;tate, even of the meane&s;t &s;ubject, far le&s;s of peers, and the body of the nation, could be declared, but in the Parliament or &s;upreme court' of ju&s;tice, upon due citation and legal proof; and that, as the proclama|tion required a material renunciation of their cove|nant, they could not obey it without bringing a cur&s;e upon the nation. They tran&s;mitted their re&s;olution to the marquis. He, next day, wrote to the earl of Rothes, and after receiving a bold reply, returned an&s;wer, that he intended to die in his maje&s;ty's cau&s;e, and to the utmo&s;t of his power prove an enemy to his ob&s;tinate countrymen. He was neverthele&s;s more merciful than his party wi&s;hed, and laboured to per|&s;uade Charles to a treaty of peace.</P>
<P>The Parliament meeting on May 15th, they agreed to prorogue it till any day his maje&s;ty plea&s;ed. But, before they left Edinburgh, they appointed general Le&s;ly their military commander in chief. Mean|while, lord Aboyn, Huntly's &s;on, and other lords appointed by Charles, had rai&s;ed a new army in the north. An inva&s;ion from Ireland was hourly ex|pected. The inactivity of Charles' army on the north border of England, and of his fleet in the Forth, was apprehended to proceed from a de&s;ign to gain time, till the covenanters &s;hould be obliged to di&s;|per&s;e them&s;elves for want of provi&s;ions. After &s;o|lemn fa&s;ting and prayer, Montro&s;e, who was offend|ed that his late activity in the north was not reward|ed with the principal command, was di&s;patched to attack the royali&s;ts in the north. General Le&s;ly
<PB N="164" REF="164">
marched his army toward the border of England,&mdash; while the &s;elect committee fixed the proper methods of modelling and &s;upplying their troops. The ac|counts of their in&s;tructions, and of Le&s;ly's march, being conveyed to the Engli&s;h army at Birks, about three miles &s;outh from Berwick, threw many of them into a terrible con&s;ternation. Charles was obliged to i&s;&s;ue forth a proclamation, That he was de&s;irous of peace, and ready to grant the Scots their ju&s;t reque&s;ts. But, fearing, that information of the true &s;tate of affairs would render many of his officers and forces altogether aver&s;e to attack them, he commanded their army not to come within ten miles of his own; in which, to manife&s;t their de&s;ire of peace, and their readine&s;s to obey him in every thing lawful, they &s;ubmitted. The bi&s;hops per&s;uaded him, that fear had made them &s;top at the appointed di&s;tance,&mdash;and to re-publi&s;h his proclamation of April 25th, declar|ing them all <HI>rebels</HI> that did not lay down their arms within eight days, and &s;etting a price on the heads of their chiefs, and charging their va&s;&s;als and tenants to pay them no more rents. This was publi&s;hed at Dun&s;e. The earl of Holland, with 4000 men, was appointed to publi&s;h it at Kel&s;o: but colonel Monro, and the lords Fleming and Er&s;kine, with their for|ces, obliged them to retire with the utmo&s;t terror and precipitation. Le&s;ly advanced to Dun&s;elaw, with his army. Contemptible enough in his crooked &s;hape, and of no more than the rank of a gentleman, he behaved him&s;elf with &s;uch prudence and authori|ty, that all the nobles readily obeyed his commands, which he wi&s;ely i&s;&s;ued forth in the form of advices. His raw troops, being daily exerci&s;ed, made great progre&s;s in military &s;kill. They had &s;ermons and public prayers, every morning and evening, from their beloved mini&s;ters. Scarcely was there a &s;ingle tent in the whole army, in which joint prayers and prai&s;es were not twice every day offered to God.&mdash; The frame of their &s;ouls was no le&s;s &s;piritual and e|levated, than if they had been attending a noted
<PB N="165" REF="165">
communion. Per&s;ua&s;ion of the goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e, and of God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in it, made them alto|gether bold and re&s;olute for battle, if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>His army being increa&s;ed to 20,000, Le&s;ly inclin|ed advancing nearer to the Engli&s;h camp, that, if po&s;&s;ible, he might apprehend &s;ome of the principal incendiaries, who had kindled the war. Informed of his intentions, the Engli&s;h laboured in fortifying their camp; and being inferior in numbers and ar|dour, were earne&s;tly de&s;irous of peace. In order to deceive the covenanters, one Le&s;ly, a Scotch dome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tic of Charles', came to their camp at Dun&s;elaw; and, with &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ions of regard to his coun|try, fal&s;ely pretended, that the Engli&s;h forces were multiplying &s;o fa&s;t, that they were in the utmo&s;t danger of being quickly &s;wallowed up by them; and therefore begged that they would once more &s;uppli|cate his maje&s;ty for a treaty of peace, in which, he &s;aid, &s;everal of the Engli&s;h nobility would &s;econd them. The Scots, nothing terrified by his tidings, but looking on him as &s;ent by &s;ome of the Engli&s;h, conde&s;cended to tran&s;mit another humble &s;upplicati|on to Charles, along with a letter to the lords of his Engli&s;h council. Puffed up with pride, Charles in|&s;i&s;ted, that they &s;hould fir&s;t publi&s;h his above-men|tioned declaration of April 25th, at the head of their army. They &s;hewed Sir Edward Vernham their rea&s;ons for refu&s;ing to do &s;o; but to &s;hew their rea|dine&s;s to go as far as they could, they read it with great reverence at the general's table. Vernham gave &s;uch a favourable report of their conduct, as made Charles think, his order had been as good as obeyed.</P>
<P>Hereupon the earls of Arundel, E&s;&s;ex, Holland, Sali&s;bury and Berk&s;hire, and &s;ecretary Coke, were impowered to treat with the earls of Rothes, Dun|fermline, and Lowdon, Sir William Douglas &s;herriff of Teviotdale, Mr. Hender&s;on, and Archibald John|&s;ton. The Scots commi&s;&s;ioners had &s;carcely entered into Arundel's tent, when Charles him&s;elf came in,
<PB N="166" REF="166">
and upbraided them for accu&s;ing him of not li&s;tening to the reque&s;ts of his loyal &s;ubjects. After begging his permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak freely, they, to his di&s;ho|nour, plainly repre&s;ented their cau&s;e, and their ju&s;t defences of it. And in the conclu&s;ion of the confe|rence, Lowdon, upon his knees, declared, that they in&s;i&s;ted for nothing more than the free enjoy|ment of their religion and liberties, according to the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws of their kingdom. This, Charles profe&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to grant; but, in&s;tigated by the bi&s;hops of Ro&s;s and Aberdeen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he talked more tartly on the Monday after, and in|terrogated them, Whether he had the &s;ole power of indicting A&s;&s;emblies? Whether he had a negative voice in them? and, Whether they might &s;it, after he had commanded them to di&s;&s;olve? After &s;ugge&s;|ting, that the deci&s;ion of &s;uch que&s;tions properly belonged to the A&s;&s;embly it&s;elf, they, for them&s;elves, allowed kings to have a power of calling General A&s;&s;emblies, and expre&s;&s;ed their hopes that him&s;elf would allow, that in extreme nece&s;&s;ity the church might conveen of her&s;elf, and enact con&s;titutions for the pre&s;ervation of religion, the plain rea&s;onablene&s;s of which they &s;hewed.</P>
<P>Being informed, that their army intended to take their &s;tation nearer to his camp, he abandoned his <HI>Queries,</HI> and de&s;ired the commi&s;&s;ioners to fix the particulars which they required as terms of peace. They propo&s;ed, that the acts of the Gla&s;gow A&s;&s;em|bly &s;hould be ratified by the Parliament; that in all time coming church affairs &s;hould be finally deter|mined by the A&s;&s;embly, and civil affairs by the Par|liament; that all his maje&s;ty's forces by &s;ea or land &s;hould be recalled; that all arre&s;ted per&s;ons, &s;hips, and goods, &s;hould be re&s;tored; that all excommuni|cated per&s;ons who, for their own private ends, had promoted the public commotions, &s;hould be remit|ted to Scotland to &s;uffer condign cen&s;ure and puni&s;h|ment. They &s;ubjoined their rea&s;ons to each of the&s;e demands. After &s;ome perplexity, and taking the
<PB N="167" REF="167">
advice of his council, Charles replied, That though, for many rea&s;ons, he could not approve the A&s;&s;em|bly of Gla&s;gow, yet he would not only agree to take away the <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> and the <HI>High Commi&s;|&s;ion,</HI> but al&s;o di&s;pen&s;e with the <HI>articles of Perth,</HI> and order, that no oath &s;hould be required of Intrants to the mini&s;try, but what was appointed by act of Par|liament; and that bi&s;hops &s;hould be cen&s;urable accor|ding to their demerits by the General A&s;&s;embly; and further agree, that all matters eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;hould be finally determined by the A&s;&s;embly, and all civil af|fairs by civil courts; that General A&s;&s;emblies &s;hould be kept once a year, or oftener, as nece&s;&s;ity requir|ed; and that, for &s;ettling the pre&s;ent di&s;tractions, a free General A&s;&s;embly &s;hould be indicted on the 6th, and a Parliament on the 20th, of Augu&s;t next; that, upon their di&s;banding their army, di&s;&s;olving their <HI>Tables</HI> and conventicles, and re&s;toring his ca&s;|tles, forts, and ammunition, and re&s;toring to his &s;ubjects their lands and goods, which had been &s;eiz|ed &s;ince the late A&s;&s;embly, he would withdraw all his forces, and make re&s;titution of every thing detained on his part.</P>
<P>After &s;ome further conference, and &s;everal private conce&s;&s;ions by Charles, the Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners were almo&s;t &s;atisfied, and the <HI>articles of pacification</HI> were drawn up, bearing, That the covenanters for|ces &s;hould be di&s;banded within 48 hours after the publication of his above declaration is agreed upon; that all his ca&s;tles, forts, and ammunition &s;hall be delivered, as &s;oon after the &s;aid publication as he &s;hall &s;end his &s;ervants to receive them; that thereon all his &s;hips &s;hall depart with the fir&s;t fair wind, and till then &s;hall in no wi&s;e interrupt the trade or fi&s;h|ing; that he &s;hall re&s;tore all per&s;ons, goods, and &s;hips, which have been detained &s;ince November la&s;t; that there &s;hall be no meetings of the &s;ubjects in Scotland, but &s;uch as are warranted by act of Par|liament; that there be no further fortifications made, and the&s;e, that are, remitted to his maje&s;ty's plea|&s;ure;
<PB N="168" REF="168">
that all his good &s;ubjects have their lands, hou&s;es, and goods re&s;tored to them, which have been &s;eized &s;ince November la&s;t. As the articles, to which his maje&s;ty had agreed, at the private confe|rence, were not &s;ub&s;cribed, nor made public, the earl of Ca&s;&s;ils, after the reading of the public articles in the camp, read and prote&s;ted, upon a &s;hort informa|tion agreed to by the managers,&mdash;That though his maje&s;ty did not approve the Gla&s;gow A&s;&s;embly, he did not intend that the acceptance of his declaration &s;hould infer any di&s;approbation of it; and that their acceptance of it imported no &s;uch thing. This infor|mation was again read along with his maje&s;ty's declara|tion at the cro&s;s of Edinburgh. While the&s;e things were tran&s;acting at Birks, Montro&s;e had, with no &s;mall difficulty, levied an army in the north, and he and colonel Middleton had routed Aboyn's forces, and were ju&s;t going to plunder the city of Aberdeen, when an expre&s;s concerning the pacification preven|ted it.</P>
<P>Neither party were plea&s;ed with the above Treaty. The furious royali&s;ts pretended, That Charles had lo&s;t a glorious opportunity of compleatly cru&s;hing the covenanters, and had di&s;honoured him&s;elf, by allowing them &s;uch equal terms; and they loudly reproached Hamilton and others, as advi&s;ers to it. Many of the covenanters were di&s;plea&s;ed with the ob&s;curity of the articles, and e&s;pecially with the &s;ur|render of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and the fortifi|cations of Leith, without proper terms. Neverthe|le&s;s, they burnt their camp, di&s;banded their army, and gave up the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh to Hamilton, who committed it to Ruthven, who had acquired much military honour in the Swedi&s;h army. But Charles paid no &s;uch regard to his &s;olemn agreement, but left &s;trong garri&s;ons in Berwick and Carli&s;le, and di&s;banded his other forces very &s;lowly. And he and his friends ripened matters for a new rupture. In Edinburgh, Huntly and Aboyn his &s;on were &s;carcely liberated from pri&s;on, when Aboyn and Ruthven, in
<PB N="169" REF="169">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir drunken revels, provoked &s;ome common peo|ple to cha&s;ti&s;e their in&s;olence; this was loudly com|plained of. Grant and Dugair, two tools of Huntly, ravaged the territories of the earl of Mar&s;hal and other covenanters, in the north. The covenanters prote&s;t again&s;t his calling of the bi&s;hops to the next General A&s;&s;embly as members; their allowance of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence money to Le&s;ly and &s;ome other officers till they could be otherwi&s;e provided; their meeting to|gether, in order to pay off the debt which they had contracted in the war; their enemies fal&s;ly charging them with forcing the &s;ub&s;cription of their covenant, and &s;ome parts of it mi&s;under&s;tood; and their com|mi&s;&s;ioners divulging &s;ome of his private conce&s;&s;ions, provoked Charles again&s;t them. Under pretence of de&s;ired con&s;ultation with them, but really intending to apprehend, if not a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate them, he called up fourteen of their principal leaders to London. But the mob, having got &s;ome notice of his intentions, prevented their obeying him. This di&s;appointment &s;o enraged him, that he had recalled both A&s;&s;embly and Parliament, if Hamilton had not per&s;uaded him otherwi&s;e, and Traquair a&s;&s;ured him, that no act of Parliament, which pa&s;&s;ed without the bi&s;hops, who were the third E&s;tate, could have force in law.</P>
<P>Hamilton having refu&s;ed to be commi&s;&s;ioner to the next A&s;&s;embly, Traquair was appointed, and was in&s;tructed to declare again&s;t lay elders having any vote in the election of commi&s;&s;ioners from Pre&s;|byteries, or in any fundamental point of religi|on;&mdash;to &s;hift all que&s;tions relative to the la&s;t A&s;|&s;embly, or to the king's power in calling or di&s;&s;olv|ing A&s;&s;emblies;&mdash;to permit the aboli&s;hment of Pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acy, not as &s;inful in it&s;elf, but as nece&s;&s;ary to the peace of the kingdom;&mdash;to allow the &s;wearing of the covenant, providing that Prelacy be not abjured in it, as contrary to the word of God and Prote&s;tant re|ligion; to endeavour to have tho&s;e mini&s;ters, who have been depo&s;ed, &s;peedily reponed, upon their profe&s;&s;ion of repentance,&mdash;and that the king may
<PB N="170" REF="170">
have a power of choo&s;ing fourteen mini&s;ters to vote in Parliament in&s;tead of the bi&s;hops; to indict ano|ther A&s;&s;embly as far back in the following year as po&s;&s;ible;&mdash;to take heed that nothing civil be treated in the A&s;&s;embly, and no commi&s;&s;ioner &s;ent from it to the king; nor any act made for the continuance of the <HI>Tables</HI> or any like meetings. And, at the end, to prote&s;t, That if any thing prejudicial to the king's intere&s;t &s;hould have been granted, he &s;hould be heard for redre&s;s in his own time and place. From the&s;e in&s;tructions it appears, that Charles merely inclined to deceive the covenanters, whom he could not &s;ubdue; and that he really inclined to yield nothing at all important, and left him&s;elf an open door to revoke every conce&s;&s;ion made in his name. Accordingly, in a few days after, he wrote to Traquair, that he would not yield to a ratification of the Gla&s;gow A&s;&s;embly, nor to the a|boli&s;hment of Prelacy as contrary to the covenant of 1581, and the con&s;titutions of this church; nor to have the <HI>&s;ervice book</HI> and <HI>canons</HI> condemned as con|taining divers &s;eeds of Popery and &s;uper&s;tition, or the <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> condemned, as without law, or de&s;tructive to civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical judicatories,&mdash; nor the <HI>Articles of Perth</HI> as contrary to the <HI>national covenant,</HI>&mdash;or that the A&s;&s;emblies 1606,&mdash;1618, &s;hould be declared de&s;titute of authority;&mdash;and that if any &s;uch thing &s;hould be done, he &s;hould prote&s;t again&s;t it. He further in&s;tructed him, that he would not be bound to allow General A&s;&s;emblies every year; and that the covenant behoved to be &s;worn as it &s;tood in 1581, without any interpretation &s;ubjoined to it, unle&s;s the king approved it. Meanwhile, he admoni&s;hed the bi&s;hops not to go to the A&s;&s;embly, as nothing but partiality could be expected at it; and a&s;&s;ured them, that notwith&s;tanding his pre&s;ent con|ce&s;&s;ions, he was firmly determined to have their grievances redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The General A&s;&s;embly having met Augu&s;t 12th, Mr. Hender&s;on opened it with a &s;ermon from Acts

No &s;ooner had Mr. Dick|&s;on the new moderator fini&s;hed a like &s;peech, than Traquair excepted again&s;t all the commi&s;&s;ions of &s;uch as had been elected by more ruling elders than mini&s;ters, or for places in which they had not their re&s;idence,&mdash;or of elders elected for places in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey re&s;ided, but had not been originally cho&s;en to their office; or of &s;uch as were under horning and outlawry,&mdash;but named no body.

This act was voted with great harmony; and Tra|quair declared his approbation of it, and promi&s;ed that it &s;hould be ratified in the en&s;uing Parliament.

<P>Contrary to Traquair's inclination, the reports o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the commi&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t A&s;&s;embly relative to their cen&s;uring of &s;candalous clergymen were produced and approved.

They next con&s;idered the <HI>Large declaration</HI> publi&s;hed in his maje&s;ty's name, but really compo&s;ed by Dr. Balcanquel, without Charles having any knowledge of many of the facts, but by his mi&s;repre&s;entation. Nine mini&s;ters, the earls of Rothes, Ca&s;&s;ils, and Lowdon, the lords Kirkcud|bright and Burleigh, and two gentlemen, were ap|pointed as a Committee to examine it. They poin|ted out <HI>eight</HI> articles di&s;honourable to his maje&s;ty, <HI>thirteen</HI> di&s;honourable to this church, <HI>thirteen</HI> di&s;|honourable to the nation, <HI>twenty-&s;ix</HI> gro&s;s fal&s;hoods, and <HI>four</HI> mo&s;t wretched mi&s;repre&s;entations of their conduct. The A&s;&s;embly therefore &s;upplicated Char|les to call in the copies of it, and appoint the writers of it to be pro&s;ecuted for their calumnies. But either Traquair neglected to pre&s;ent their peti|tion, or Charles di&s;regarded it.&mdash;They al&s;o autho|ri&s;ed the &s;ub&s;cription of the national covenant, as explained by the Gla&s;gow A&s;&s;embly, and be&s;ought the privy council to require it of all the &s;ubjects with due expedition. Traquair &s;ub&s;cribed it, with a de|claration, which he &s;aid merely re&s;pected him as king's commi&s;&s;ioner; and he promi&s;ed to have their act ratified by the Parliament. They recommended to the Parliament a &s;upplication in favours of &s;ome mini&s;ters, who had been oppre&s;&s;ed by Huntly and other royali&s;ts, in the Highlands and I&s;lands. They approved &s;everal overtures, bearing, That a commit|tee

<P>As, by the in&s;tigation of Strafford, an oath ac|knowledging the king's &s;upremacy in <HI>all eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> and civil cau&s;es, and an abjuration of the Scotch covenant, and all like bonds, had been impo&s;ed up|on &s;uch Scot&s;men, as were found in England, and e&s;pecially in Ireland, where Strafford domineered, many who had been thereby oppre&s;&s;ed, be&s;ought the A&s;&s;embly to interceed in their favours, and de|clared them&s;elves ready to &s;wear the <HI>oath of allegiance,</HI> or any other declaration of loyalty con&s;i&s;tent with their covenant. The A&s;&s;embly recommended this affair to the en&s;uing Parliament. It is ob&s;ervable, that many tender Chri&s;tians, who fled from Ireland, to avoid the above oath, e&s;caped the ma&s;&s;acre, while tho&s;e, who complied with it from carnal con&s;iderati|ons, were quickly &s;tript of their lives and property by the Papi&s;ts.&mdash;After appointing their next meet|ing, Mr. Dick&s;on, in a &s;olemn &s;peech, repre&s;ented the mixture of God's mercy and ju&s;tice towards them for &s;ome time pa&s;t; and that, on account of his maje&s;ty's education and mi&s;information, they ought always to view his conduct in the mo&s;t favour|able light;&mdash;and commended Hamilton and Tra|quair for the &s;ervices, which they had done this church; and recommended to mini&s;ters and elders their re&s;pective duties, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.

Soon after the ri&s;ing of this A&s;&s;embly, a &s;olemn thank&s;giving was ob&s;erved through the kingdom, the cau&s;es of which were drawn up by the Pre&s;by|tery of Edinburgh.</P>
<P>When the Parliament met, Augu&s;t 31&s;t, it was propo&s;ed to have the following articles enacted into &s;tanding laws.

But Traquair the com|mi&s;&s;ioner, directed by Charles, or afraid that &s;uch deeds would enrage him, prevented their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, by proroguing the Parliament nine times in the months of September and October.&mdash;Finding them&s;elves thus re&s;trained, they deputed the earl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Lowdon and Dunfermline to implore Charles' al|lowance to proceed in their work: and meanwhile a &s;olemn fa&s;t was ob&s;erved for bewailing that their e|nemies were like to fru&s;trate their great expectati|ons; and that oppre&s;&s;ion and violence much prevail|ed in the northern parts of the kingdom; that there were few faithful labourers in the church; and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> due care taken of the &s;eminaries of learning; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ca&s;e of the truly poor was much overlooked&punc; while &s;turdy beggars ranged about without controul&punc; and that unthankfulne&s;s, carnal &s;ecurity, indolenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in promoting of the reformation, which they had &s;olemnly engaged, and neglect of God's wor&s;hip i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> public, private or &s;ecret, much abounded.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="175">Informed of the approach of Dunfermline and Lowdon, and &s;uppo&s;ing that they had no commi&s;&s;i|on from Traquair, Charles prohibited them to come within a mile of his pre&s;ence. By the Queen's, Strafford's, and Laud's influence, his private con|ce&s;&s;ions to the covenanters at the treaty of Birks, were openly impugned, and publicly burnt by the hangman. Traquair was charged to prorogue the Parliament till the 2d of June 1640; and to declare &s;uch as &s;hould refu&s;e to ri&s;e, guilty of <HI>high trea&s;on.</HI> When he executed his orders, November 14th, the E&s;tates read a &s;olemn declaration again&s;t his deed, narrating what had been done, and declaring the prorogation null and void: but that, to carry their obedience to the utmo&s;t length, that could con&s;i&s;t with a good con&s;cience, they would di&s;continue their meeting, till, by their committee, they had pre&s;ent|ed their remon&s;trances to his maje&s;ty. Commi&s;&s;ion|ers from this committee, were allowed to repair to Charles. But Traquair, to atone for the offence, which he had given by his conce&s;&s;ions in the A&s;&s;em|bly, after &s;everal attempts to divide the covenanters, or to exa&s;perate them by his arbitrary procedure, repaired to court, and there repre&s;ented their con|duct in the mo&s;t odious light, and &s;ugge&s;ted, that they could only be &s;ubdued by force, &s;ome methods of which he pointed out,&mdash;and thus inflamed the Eng|li&s;h courtiers. Dunfermline and Lowdon, and two gentlemen, were neverthele&s;s &s;ent up to his maje&s;ty, but directed to beware of acknowledging the Engli&s;h council as their judges;&mdash;to refute the mi&s;repre|&s;entations of Traquair; to &s;upport the articles which had been propo&s;ed to the Parliament; to in&s;i&s;t for a &s;peedy recal of that court; to remon&s;trate again&s;t filling the ca&s;tles of Edinburgh and Dumbarton with foreigners, or exacting from Scotchmen in England and Ireland any oath incon&s;i&s;tent with their cove|nant.&mdash;They managed their cau&s;e with great &s;pirit, &mdash;illu&s;trated the articles mentioned, and an&s;wered a multitude of objections made by Laud and Traquair.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="176">After Charles and his council had, for a time, pretended a de&s;ire of agreement, that they might carry on their warlike preparations the more unob|&s;ervably, the Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners were taken into cu&s;tody, and Lowdon committed to the Tower for a letter, which they pretended, he had &s;ent to the French king. The letter referred to had been drawn up a year before by Montro&s;e, when Charles was marching to invade Scotland, and had been tran|&s;cribed by Lowdon, and &s;ub&s;cribed by them two, and the lords Mar, Montgomery, Forre&s;ter, and general Le&s;ly; but never made u&s;e of; nor had ei|ther date or direction. One Goram getting hold of it, delivered it to Traquair, and he to Charles, who hoped to turn it to his own advantage, particularly in making a &s;acrifice of Lowdon, who had been a principal leader of the covenanters. Upon exami|nation, Lowdon readily acknowledged his own hand writing and &s;ub&s;cription; but pled, that the letter was written before the late pacification, when hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> maje&s;ty was marching to invade his native kingdom; and that, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, they thought none &s;o fit to <HI>interceed</HI> with him as his brother in law, than which their letter de&s;ired no more, Notwith&s;tand|ing, Charles was determined to have him a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and ordered Balfour, lieutenant of the Tower, to have his head &s;truck off, before nine o'clock nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> morning. After informing Lowdon, Balfour ac|quainted Hamilton with this mandate. He and Bal|four having got acce&s;s to Charles, &s;o repre&s;ented to him the infamous nature of murdering a nobleman&punc; to whom he had given a &s;afe conduct, and the ter|rible con&s;equences that might follow, that they go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him with reluctance, to tear his warrant. Some|time after, upon promi&s;e of concealing his treat|ment, and engaging to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to di&s;po&s;e his countrymen to &s;ubjection, Lowdon was permitted to return home.</P>
<P>In November 1639, Charles and his council had re&s;olved upon a new war with the Scots. But it was
<PB N="177" REF="177">
difficult to find money to bear the expences of it Strafford &s;ub&s;cribed for 20,000 pounds &s;terling, the dukes of Lennox and Richmond for as much, if not the double. Many of the Engli&s;h nobility and gen|try &s;ub&s;cribed largely enough, chiefly the Papi&s;ts, in|&s;tigated by their queen. By Strafford's influence, the Iri&s;h Parliament voted about 24,000 pounds. The Engli&s;h clergy voted an annual compliment of 20,000. All the&s;e being in&s;ufficient, Charles was obliged to call an Engli&s;h Parliament to provide more; but who&s;e &s;tubborn commons would allow him no money, unle&s;s in the way of &s;ecuring their own reli|gion and liberties, which he and his agents had fear|fully infringed. He therefore had recour&s;e to me|thods di&s;hone&s;t and infamous,&mdash;which gave the co|venanters time to prepare for their own defence. Meanwhile, Charles did them all the mi&s;chief that he could. Their &s;hips were arre&s;ted in England and Ireland; and the&s;e that were trafficking to other places were &s;eized, and the&s;e in them barbarou&s;ly impri&s;oned. The ca&s;tle of Edinburgh was repaired and reinforced, and the garri&s;on daily killing &s;ome of the inhabitants, or &s;poiling their hou&s;es. The Engli&s;h general had a commi&s;&s;ion to de&s;troy the whole Scotch nation. Charles publi&s;hed a <HI>declaration,</HI> requiring all his &s;ubjects in England and Ireland, to take arms again&s;t them, and treat them as rebels. The Iri&s;h Parliament declared them &s;uch. Alarmed by the&s;e things, the covenanters &s;ent Rothes and Lind&s;ay to &s;olicit the marquis of Hamilton to interceed for them with their king. But finding no help in man, they betook them&s;elves to God by fa&s;ting and prayer. The Pre&s;bytery of Edinburgh, which had been de&s;ired, by the Committee of E&s;tates, to warn the church of her approaching danger, propo&s;ed a &s;olemn fa&s;t on ac|count of the gro&s;s ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition, &s;orcery, profanation of the Lord's name and Sabbath, neglect of his wor&s;hip, uncleanne&s;s, intemperance, fraud and violence, contrary to their covenants,&mdash;and on ac|count of their perplexing outward circum&s;tances,

theeeby procured: They al&s;o &s;pread informatory remon&s;trances among their friends in England, part of which were burnt by the hangmen. Neverthele&s;s they did not begin their warlike preparations till June next year: Nor did they &s;tir, till the Parlia|ment had concluded on the war, and appointed the general officers. The&s;e in the we&s;t did not begin their march till Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>When the Parliament met at Edinburgh, June 2, 1640, Traquair dur&s;t not attend it, as Charles' com|mi&s;&s;ioner. But the lords Elphing&s;ton and Napier, Orbi&s;ton ju&s;tice clerk, and Lewis Stewart as king's advocate, were impowered in his ab&s;ence to prorogue their meeting. But, upon reading their commi&s;&s;ion, Elphing&s;ton and Napier doubted of the legality of their acting without Traquair's order, and the other two could do nothing but prote&s;t. The E&s;tates therefore voted them&s;elves a legal Parliament, and cho&s;e lord Burleigh for their pre&s;ident; and enacted all the articles propo&s;ed at their former meeting, with &s;ome variations. They ordained that this and all fu|ture meetings of Parliament &s;hould con&s;i&s;t only of noblemen, barons, and burge&s;&s;es, re&s;cinding all for|mer laws in favours of the voting of bi&s;hops or other clergymen;&mdash;that all future Parliaments &s;hall have the power of appointing a committee for drawing up <HI>articles</HI> to be laid before them,&mdash;the members of which each E&s;tate &s;hall choo&s;e from among them|&s;elves. They ratified the act of the la&s;t General A&s;|&s;embly condemning <HI>bygone corruptions,</HI> and appointed the late covenant to be &s;ub&s;cribed by all ranks under all civil pains; and particularly by members of Par|liament before admi&s;&s;ion to a &s;eat, and by all magi&s;|trates, mini&s;ters, and &s;tate officers, before their ad|mi&s;&s;ion. They declared, that the power of juri&s;dic|tion in the church &s;tands only in A&s;&s;emblies, Synods, Pre&s;byteries, and Se&s;&s;ions; and revived the act of 1592, <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing Pre&s;byterian government</HI> in all the heads of it; and re&s;cinded all laws in favours of <HI>Pre|lacy;</HI> but, for fear of giving an handle to their ex|a&s;perated

king, left unnoticed &s;ome former acts of Parliament e&s;tabli&s;hing his eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy. They declared <HI>null</HI> and <HI>void</HI> all the cen&s;ures inflicted by the late bi&s;hops or their agents; and that Pre&s;by|teries had the power of pre&s;enting mini&s;ters in the&s;e pari&s;hes, in which the bi&s;hops had claimed it; and ordained, that Pre&s;byteries, with con&s;ent of the con|gregation, &s;hould plant the&s;e pari&s;hes, which had lain &s;ix months vacant. They prohibited the going of mills and &s;alt pans, and the fi&s;hing of &s;almon on Lord's days, or the holding of fairs upon Mondays; and appointed ju&s;tices of peace and kirk &s;e&s;&s;ions to prevent the profanation of the Sabbath by the con|fluence of reapers, or of people to hire them in har|ve&s;t. They ratified all the former laws again&s;t Pa|pi&s;ts, excommunicated per&s;ons, and &s;uch as re&s;et them; and appointed letters of horning to be i&s;&s;ued forth again&s;t the bi&s;hops and other excommunicated per&s;ons. They approved the A&s;&s;embly's &s;upplication again&s;t the <HI>large declaration,</HI> and ordered the authors and &s;preaders of it to be puni&s;hed as guilty of <HI>lea&s;e-making</HI> and &s;owing divi&s;ion between his maje&s;ty and his loyal &s;ubjects. They enacted, That a free Par|liament &s;hould be held once, or oftener, in every three years; that the ca&s;tles of Edinburgh, Dum|barton, and Stirling, &s;hould be intru&s;ted only to natives, well affected to king and country; that none &s;hould vote in Parliament by proxy; that none &s;hould be nobilitated, who had not ten thou&s;and marks of yearly rent in the kingdom; that the Lords &s;hould no more be di&s;tingui&s;hed into temporal and <HI>&s;piritual;</HI> that the privy council &s;hould be accountable to his maje&s;ty and Parliament, and be puni&s;hable for giving wrong coun&s;el. They declared <HI>null</HI> and <HI>void</HI> all un|lawful proclamations i&s;&s;ued in his maje&s;ty's name, &s;ince the commencement of the late troubles; and that the antient acts of Parliament forbidding leagues and conventions among the &s;ubjects, did not extend to &s;uch as were made for the pre&s;ervation of the king's life or authority, or of the religion, laws, and li|berties

of the kingdom. They appointed twelve no|blemen, &s;ixteen barons, and twelve burge&s;&s;es, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> committee to give directions concerning the impend|ing war; and appointed a <HI>tenth</HI> of all land and hou&s;e rents, and a <HI>twentieth</HI> of all intere&s;t of money, to be rai&s;ed for carrying it on; and that the heirs, of &s;uch as &s;hould be &s;lain in the defence of their religion and country, &s;hould have a free entry to what belonged to them. They further appointed all the &s;ubjects to &s;ub&s;cribe a bond for the maintenance and defence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the acts of this Parliament; appointed general offi|cers for their army; and pa&s;&s;ed a &s;entence of forfei|ture upon general Ruthven for refu&s;ing to deliver up the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and for the daily mi&s;chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he did to the city. After nine days, the Parliament ro&s;e; and their committee &s;ent a copy of their acts to lord Lanerk &s;ecretary for Scotch affairs,&mdash;and &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that if the violences offered to their per&s;ons and goods without the kingdom, were not quickly repre&s;&s;ed, they behoved to provide for their own deliverance and &s;afety,&mdash;and a&s;&s;igned the rea&s;ons o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their conduct.&mdash;But Charles was &s;o far from being &s;a|tisfied, that he con&s;idered their parliamentary proce|dure, as a blow at the root of his authority.</P>
<P>The General A&s;&s;embly met at Aberdeen, July 28th, 1640; and, after enacting &s;ome <HI>rules</HI> for the ordering of their own meetings, they ordained, That all monuments of idolatry, particularly in the north, &s;hould be de&s;troyed; that the laws again&s;t witches and charmers &s;hould be carefully executed; that &s;uch as &s;hould &s;peak again&s;t the covenant after they had taken it, &s;hould be cen&s;ured; that candidates for the mini&s;try, who refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe it, &s;hould be declared incapable of teaching children, reading in kirks, preaching within Pre&s;byteries, or re&s;iding in burghs, univer&s;ities, or colleges,&mdash;and &s;hould be proce&s;&s;ed as &s;candalous, if they continued ob&s;tinate. They appointed a &s;olemn fa&s;t upon the 28th of Au|gu&s;t, on account of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. As in this northern A&s;&s;embly, there were many cler|gymen,
<PB N="181" REF="181">
who either did not believe Prelacy and the Articles of Perth to be &s;inful in them&s;elves, or were unwilling to acknowledge them as &s;uch, they did not attack the doctors of Aberdeen in their adhe|rence to the&s;e; but found them guilty of Arminia|ni&s;m. Dr. Forbes was &s;pared for the time, on ac|count of his ingenuity; and Scroggs on account of his health; but Sibbald, tenaciou&s;ly adhering to his errors, was depo&s;ed.</P>
<P>An affair relative to <HI>praying &s;ocieties,</HI> gave them much more trouble. During their want of faithful mini&s;ters, many &s;erious people, in Scotland and Ire|land, had met together on Sabbaths and other occa|&s;ions, for prayer and &s;piritual conference. Some, before they were driven from Ireland, had been a little infected with <HI>Browni&s;m</HI> from England, and had inclined to join the Independents in New England. The&s;e brought along with them &s;ome of their &s;ingu|larities, which were overlooked, on account of their remarkable piety, till an appearance thereof happen|ed in the charge of Henry Guthry of Stirling, after|ward worthle&s;s bi&s;hop of Dunkeld. The laird of Lecky, a man remarkable for knowledge and &s;erious godline&s;s, and who had been a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ufferer under the late bi&s;hops, much encouraged fellow&s;hip meetings for prayer and Chri&s;tian conference. Seve|ral of his neighbours, who could not read them&s;elves, or who thought his manner more edifying than their own, attended his family wor&s;hip. Some, who pro|bably came as &s;pies, alledged, that in prayer he u&s;ed &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions not duly honourable to Guthry his mini&s;ter. Guthry immediately pro&s;ecuted Lecky be|fore his Pre&s;bytery, and got fellow&s;hip meetings con|demned as prejudicial to the &s;tanding office of the mini&s;try, and got the magi&s;trates to extirpate them from the place. Not &s;atisfied with this, he laboured to have them utterly aboli&s;hed from the nation; and by collecting and exaggerating reports of their, im|prudences, he drew Mr. Hender&s;on and Mr. Calder|wood, who had &s;een the Browni&s;tical di&s;orders in
<PB N="182" REF="182">
Holland, and &s;ome other leading clergymen, to his &s;ide. In the A&s;&s;embly 1638, he had attempted to foi&s;t in a complaint again&s;t the&s;e meetings. But Me&s;&s;rs. J. Living&s;ton, S. Rutherfoord, and D. Dick|&s;on, and others, unwilling that many &s;erious &s;aints &s;hould be publicly di&s;credited for the imprudence of a few, got the affair kept from any public hearing; and it was agreed, that Guthry &s;hould preach up the duty of family wor&s;hip, upon which he &s;aid the&s;e meetings encroached, and that the eminently pious Me&s;&s;rs. Blair, Living&s;ton, and M'Lellan, who be|friended &s;uch &s;ocieties, &s;hould preach again&s;t night meetings, and the abu&s;es complained of. Their &s;oft and Chri&s;tian methods of correcting or preventing &s;uch abu&s;es not plea&s;ing Guthry, who hated to &s;ee or hear of any others more &s;erious than him&s;elf, he continued to exclaim again&s;t the&s;e meetings in gene|ral. To quench this flame of contention, Me&s;&s;rs. Hender&s;on and Borthwick upon the one &s;ide, and Dick&s;on and Blair upon the other, held a &s;olemn con|ference on the point. Hender&s;on drew up a paper of <HI>regulations</HI> or <HI>caveats</HI> for &s;uch meetings, bearing, That the members &s;hould be few, and &s;uch as were proper to meet together; that the meetings &s;hould not interfere with public or family wor&s;hip or relative duties, nor be held is the night; that they &s;hould be occa&s;ional, and no wi&s;e tending to &s;eparate the members from the re&s;t of the congregation; that no impertinent que&s;tions or uncharitable judging of o|thers &s;hould be allowed in them; that if any mem|bers in them had any objection again&s;t the common form of public wor&s;hip, (as <HI>bowing</HI> in the pulpit, and &s;inging the <HI>Gloria Patri</HI>) they &s;hould di&s;creetly lay them before the per&s;ons concerned; and finally, that all things relative to them &s;hould be conducted with holine&s;s, prudence, humility, and charity. This gave general &s;atisfaction. But Guthry and his a&s;&s;i&s;|tants pretending, that <HI>caveats</HI> brought in bi&s;hops, pu&s;hed the matter into this northern A&s;&s;embly, in which they expected their friends to be &s;tronge&s;t.
<PB N="183" REF="183">
Guthry poured forth torrents of accu&s;ation again&s;t the ab&s;ent Lecky, and the &s;ociety meetings. Sim|&s;on of Bathgate &s;econded him; and in the mo&s;t out|ragious manner upbraided Rutherfoord, Living&s;ton, and M'Lellan, as encouragers of them. Supported by the earl of Seaforth, and many of the northern clergy, Guthry and his faction thought to have car|ried an act for the utter &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of them. But Dick&s;on, Bailie, Rutherfoord, and others, &s;o warmly oppo&s;ed them, that they could only get it enacted, That people &s;hould ob&s;erve family wor&s;hip with the members of the family alone; that reading of pray|ers is lawful, where none can pray extempore; that none but preachers &s;hall explain &s;cripture; and that no innovation relative to the time, matter or manner of religious wor&s;hip, or the number or quality of joiners in it, be introduced without allowance from the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Charles and the covenanters prepared for war of another kind, and laboured to divert the blame of it from them&s;elves. Charles loudly com|plained, that they, by their own authority, had rai&s;|ed forces, provided large &s;tores of artillery, and im|po&s;ed taxes; that they had publi&s;hed &s;candalous pa|pers, under pretence of informing the Engli&s;h; had refu&s;ed materials for the reparation of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; had committed violence upon &s;ome of the garri&s;on, and prepared to block them up; had impri&s;oned lord Southe&s;k and others for their loyal|ty; had written to the French king for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and that the magi&s;trates of Edinburgh had, on &s;eve|ral occa&s;ions, refu&s;ed due obedience. The covenan|ters pled, That they had done nothing but what his maje&s;ty's refu&s;als to grant their ju&s;t and humble peti|tions for redre&s;s of grievances, and the violences committed by per&s;ons pretending his orders, had o|bliged them to; that they had granted favours to tho&s;e in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, notwith&s;tanding the unprovoked injuries, murders, and violences which they had &s;uffered from them; that they had
<PB N="184" REF="184">
but protected Southe&s;k and his fellows from the vio|lence of the mob; that the council and citizens of Edinburgh had done every thing in their power, as faithful and humble &s;ervants; that they never in|tended to a&s;k any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the French king, far le&s;s to &s;ubject them&s;elves to his authority, but merely de&s;ired to prevent his taking offence at them, and helping to de&s;troy them, and de&s;igned to &s;uppli|cate his mediation in their favours, in order that an unnatural war might be prevented; that they had nevet &s;ent him the letter referred to, nor &s;o much as ever directed or dated it; that they reckoned it a notorious breach of the law of nations, to have their deputies, under his maje&s;ty's &s;afe conduct, im|pri&s;oned by him, and Lowdon, who had no more hand in the above mentioned letter than others, pu|ni&s;hed, without &s;o much as a form of trial.</P>
<P>Argyle being appointed to deal with the di&s;affect|ed chieftains and clans of the north, invaded the ter|ritories of the earl of Athol, apprehended him&s;elf and fourteen other principal loyali&s;ts,&mdash;and obliged his va&s;&s;als to pay the contributions required by the Parliament, together with 10,000 pound Scots, for the &s;upport of his army, which had been rai&s;ed on their account. He u&s;ed the territories of Airly in much the &s;ame manner. But it doth not appear, that ever he allowed any thing to be taken from the people, but the common tax, and that which he found nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his troops. Robert Monro, who was di&s;patched again&s;t the mar|quis of Huntly, earl of Aboyn, and Sir James Ogil|vy of Bamff, was not &s;o delicate. He, at his own hand, impo&s;ed the covenant upon &s;uch as he thought di&s;affected, and remitted about forty of the citizens of Aberdeen and gentlemen about, pri&s;oners to E|dinburgh. He turned Huntly's palace into a garri|&s;on, and de&s;troyed Sir James' man&s;ion hou&s;e, and wherever he came, &s;eized on the effects of the roy|ali&s;ts.</P>

<P>It &s;carcely appears, that Charles really intended a pacification. In&s;tead thereof, he laboured to increa&s;e his army, procure provi&s;ions, and furni&s;h his garri|&s;ons, and required all the trained bands northward of the river Trent to be ready to march upon a day's warning. It was reported, that Strafford had &s;ent for ten thou&s;and Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts to join him. Le&s;ly therefore demanded four or five thou&s;and recruits from Scotland, which, with a band of gentlemen from Argyle&s;hire, immediately marched to his a&s;&s;i&s;|tance. But the Engli&s;h peers, meeting at York upon September 24th, appointed eight earls and as many lords to treat with the Scots. The earls of Morton, Traquair, and Lanerk, with Sir Lewis Stewart and Henry Vane, were appointed their a&s;&s;i&s;tants. But the Scots would not admit them. The earls of Rothes, Lowdon, and Dunfermline, A. Hender|&s;on, and Archibald John&s;ton, and &s;ix gentlemen, were commi&s;&s;ioners from the covenanters. After &s;ome conferences at Rippon, the place of treaty was
<PB N="190" REF="190">
transferred to London, and a ce&s;&s;ation of arms was immediately agreed upon, providing that the Scotch army &s;hould have 850 pounds Sterling <HI>per</HI> day allow|ed them for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, till the treaty &s;hould be fi|ni&s;hed; that no fortification &s;hould be erected on ei|ther &s;ide; that the river Tees &s;hould be the boun|daries between the two armies, unle&s;s the Scot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be obliged to appoint detachments to collect the contributions allotted them on the &s;outh &s;ide of it.</P>

<P>The Parliament of 1640, had been adjourned from time to time, till July 15th, 1641, when 39 noblemen, 49 barons, and 57 repre&s;entatives of burghs met; but re&s;olved to tran&s;act no important bu&s;ine&s;s, till his maje&s;ty &s;hould come down in the following month.

But the duke of Lennox, marquis of Hamilton, and earls of Morton, Roxburgh, Anan|dale, Kinnoul, Lauderdale, Perth, Lanerk, Gallo|way, and Dumfries, after &s;ome demur, yielded to the terms, and &s;o the number of peers was increa&s;ed to forty-eight.

But the breaking out of the Popi&s;h ma&s;&s;acre of the Prote&s;tants in Ireland prevented the execution of this, and obliged his maje&s;ty to po&s;t off to London, as &s;oon as this Parliament ended.

They excommunicated Roger Lind&s;ay for bla&s;phemy, and appointed John Seaton to put from his hou&s;e, a wo|man with whom it was &s;u&s;pected, he kept a criminal corre&s;pondence. They agreed upon a religious and &s;olemn covenant with the Engli&s;h Parliamentarians; and, at the reque&s;t of the We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly, ap|pointed Me&s;&s;rs. A. Hender&s;on, R.

<P>After the A&s;&s;embly and Convention of E&s;tates had approved of the <HI>&s;olemn league and covenant,</HI> it was tran&s;mitted to London, and with &s;ome &s;mall altera|tions approved by the A&s;&s;embly, and both hou&s;es of Parliament. Being remitted to Edinburgh, the Commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly, Oct. 11th, appointed it to be &s;worn and &s;ub&s;cribed through the whole church, and, by mi&s;&s;ives to Pre&s;byteries, di|rected them how to forward the &s;ame. In con&s;e|quence hereof, the Committee appointed by the Convention of E&s;tates next day appointed it to be &s;worn and &s;ub&s;cribed by all the &s;ubjects, under pain of being held and puni&s;hed as enemies to religion and his maje&s;ty's honour, and peace of the kingdoms, and to have their goods confi&s;cated for the u&s;e of the public, and not to be allowed to enjoy any bene|fit, place, or office within the kingdom, and ap|pointed &s;herriffs and other magi&s;trates, to a&s;&s;i&s;t mi|ni&s;ters in promoting this engagement.

<P>Nov. 29th, 1643, the Committee of E&s;tates and commi&s;&s;ioners from England fini&s;hed their treaty of friend&s;hip, bearing, That the <HI>&s;olemn league and covenant</HI> &s;hould be &s;worn and &s;ub&s;cribed by all ranks in both kingdoms; that 18,000 foot, and 3,000 hor&s;e &s;hould immediately march to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h Parliament, with victuals and pay for the &s;pace of forty days; that this army &s;hould be commanded by a Scotch general, but &s;ubject to the direction of the two Parliaments, and their committees; that the whole expences contracted by the Scots, &s;hould be repaid to them at the end of the war; that their ar|my &s;hould receive 30,000 pounds &s;terling <HI>per</HI> month out of the e&s;tates of the Engli&s;h papi&s;ts and other malignants, and have 100,000 pounds <HI>per</HI> advance; that the Scots &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t with their credit in rai&s;ing 200,000 pounds for that purpo&s;e, and for payment of their troops in Ireland, which &s;hall be repaid them at the end of the war; that no pacification &s;hall be made with his maje&s;ty, without the con&s;ent of both kingdoms; that the Scotch troops in Eng|land &s;hall be no wi&s;e employed, but to an&s;wer the ends of this treaty; that the Engli&s;h &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t the Scots in any like extremity; and that eight &s;hips &s;hall pro|tect their coa&s;ts and trade.</P>
<P>In January 1644, the Scots army, to the amount of 21,500, marched into England, under the com|mand of old General Le&s;ly, now earl of Leven, and John Bailie lieutenant general of the hor&s;e, and Da|vid

To oblige them to return home, that Charles might at lea&s;t recover the we&s;t of England, Montro&s;e, Crawford, Nith&s;dale, A|boyn, Ogilvy, Rae, Herreis, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> entered into an <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI> at Oxford, to return to Scotland, and rai&s;e forces for his maje&s;ty. Antrim undertook to &s;end them 10,000 Iri&s;h, under the command of Alexan|der M'Donald, a Scot. Huntly took the field with a con&s;iderable body, which Argyle quickly &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed. In returning northward, through We&s;tmore|land, Montro&s;e rai&s;ed a body of forces, and &s;et up his maje&s;ty's &s;tandard at Dumfries. But the &s;herriff of Teviotdale, marching a body of countrymen to|ward them, they fled at the &s;ight, and Montro&s;e him&s;elf e&s;caped to Carli&s;le. The commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly laid him under the le&s;&s;er excom|munication, and ordered it to be publi&s;hed from all the pulpits in the kingdom. Exa&s;perated by this, he pu&s;hed his way northward along with two others, and put him&s;elf at the head of the Iri&s;h ragamuffins, who, in &s;maller numbers than was expected, had ju&s;t landed in Argyle&s;hire, where they committed the mo&s;t barbarous ravages upon mini&s;ters and o|thers, whom they looked on as mo&s;t hearty in the covenanting intere&s;t. He conducted them ea&s;tward through Badenoch and Athol, where many joined them, and in Perth&s;hire, a whole regiment rai&s;ed by lord Kilpont. Argyle, with a body of undi&s;ciplined countrymen, thought to attack them: but Mon|tro&s;e fell upon them before they were ready; and, e&s;pecially in their flight, killed many of them. Af|ter ravaging Argyle&s;hire, and turning it into a kind of de&s;ert, he marched toward Lochaber and Glenco, in order to collect his friends in that country.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="205">Meanwhile, the Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners to the We&s;t|min&s;ter A&s;&s;embly were but coldly received by many; nor, till after a warm debate, were they allowed to be members.

None of them made a more &s;hining appear|ance than Gille&s;py the younge&s;t.

They declared the <HI>bond of a&s;&s;ociation</HI> at Ox|ford, framed by Montro&s;e and his fellow covenant-breakers, <HI>perfidious,</HI> and calculated to throw this church and kingdom into confu&s;ion; and empower|ed their commi&s;&s;ion to proceed again&s;t all that enter|ed into it to the highe&s;t excommunication, unle&s;s they &s;hould publicly acknowledge their offence. They appointed mini&s;ters to delate to their Pre&s;by|teries, all &s;uch as manife&s;ted di&s;&s;atisfaction to the co|venanted cau&s;e. They wrote to the churches in Holland, thanking them for &s;ending &s;upplies of mo|ney to their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren in Ireland, and in|forming them of their own critical circum&s;tances and covenant with God. They appointed mini&s;ters to be more diligent in rai&s;ing the fines annexed by law to &s;candals, and applying them to pious u&s;es. They appointed a contribution in favours of their Prote&s;tant brethren in Ireland, and gave order for &s;upplying their armies with mini&s;ters; and appoin|ted a &s;olemn fa&s;t to confe&s;s their &s;ins, lament their mi&s;eries, and &s;upplicate relief from God.</P>

The Parliament being therefore obliged to meet again in July, a raging pe&s;tilence kept them from Edinburgh, and drove them from Stirling to Perth. They appointed a new levy of ten thou&s;and troops to with&s;tand Montro&s;e; and devi&s;ed methods for paying them.

<P>Finding that the covenanted forces were a&s;&s;embled at Perth, Montro&s;e attempted to pu&s;h &s;outhward, to favour his junction with a body of hor&s;e, which he expected from his maje&s;ty: and, to draw off Bailie's attention, M'Donald, with his Iri&s;h, fell up|on the Campbells, near Cowpar Angus, murdering all that they met with.

But they, expecting reinforcements from Fife, would not &s;tir from their entrenchments. He therefore marched &s;outhward by Kinro&s;s; and then turning we&s;tward to Stirling, burnt into a de&s;art the pari&s;hes of Muckart and Dollar, which pertained to Argyle. Informed of his motions, the covenanters marched the near way to Stirling, burnt the hou&s;es of Men&s;try and Airth|ry, which belonged to malignants; but did no hurt to their tenants; and came up with him at Kil&s;yth, Augu&s;t, 15th, 1645, where he gave them battle, before their expected we&s;tern a&s;&s;i&s;tants came up; and,

To &s;hut them up to mutiny, de&s;ertion, or oppre&s;&s;ion of the coun+try by taking free quarters, they withheld their pay
<PB N="213" REF="213">
pretending, that the intere&s;t would &s;ufficiently ba|lance the delay of payment. Being thus obliged to take free quarters, the&s;e were di&s;hone&s;tly over-rated. Want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence obliged them to want mini&s;ters, which occa&s;ioned a profane licentiou&s;ne&s;s in &s;everals. Sometimes the Engli&s;h Parliament, for weeks, or even for months, neglected to an&s;wer the remon|&s;trances of their commi&s;&s;ioners. Their expre&s;&s;es were &s;ometimes intercepted, and their letters opened, while the hou&s;e of commons &s;creened the offenders. In their treaty with Charles at Uxbridge, they chang|ed almo&s;t every thing in the propo&s;itions made to his maje&s;ty, which marked the power of, or did ho|nour to the Scots, and a&s;&s;umed all to them&s;elves. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e provocations, the Scots, regardful of their &s;olemn covenant with God, did all that in them lay, and even renounced part of their own intere&s;t, in order to promote the peace and welfare of England.</P>
<P>In May 1646, Charles, after he had empowered Ormond and Digby to clap up a peace with the Iri&s;h Papi&s;ts, which almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed their religion to them, in order that he might obtain their faithful &s;ervice again&s;t his Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects in Britain,&mdash; he fled from Oxford when it was upon the point of being blocked up by the Parliament's army; and in company with two or three more, rode within a few miles of London; then directed his cour&s;e toward the &s;ea; and at la&s;t re&s;olved to throw him&s;elf into the Scotch army, which lay at Newca&s;tle; and con|tinued with them about eight months. Commi&s;&s;i|oners from the committee of E&s;tates pre&s;ented to him &s;ome propo&s;itions for peace; and the&s;e above-mentioned, from the A&s;&s;embly, laboured to remove his prejudices again&s;t Pre&s;bytery and the cove|nants. At lea&s;t pretending, that he believed Epi&s;|copacy to be of divine appointment; and that he had bound him&s;elf by his coronation oath to &s;upport it, he and Sir Robert Murray, debated this point in a &s;e|ries of letters with Mr. A. Hender&s;on;&mdash;in which he
<PB N="214" REF="214">
pretended, that the Engli&s;h, in their reformation, had <HI>preci&s;ely</HI> followed the apo&s;tolic appointment, and the univer&s;al pattern of the primitive church; and that where the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of epi&s;copal prie&s;thood cea&s;|eth, there is no valid admini&s;tration of the &s;acra|ments; that no reformation of churches is lawful, but under the direction of royal authority; that no real defects could be pointed out in the reformation e&s;tabli&s;hed by K. Edward and Q. Elizabeth; that Pre&s;byterian government was never known till Cal|vin introduced it at Geneva; that the unanimous con&s;ent of the Fathers is the true &s;tandard of inter|preting &s;cripture; and that the clau&s;e in his coro|nation oath re&s;pecting religion being in&s;erted in fa|vours of the church, the Parliament cannot di&s;&s;olve that obligation without her con&s;ent. In his replies, Mr. Hender&s;on &s;hewed, That many &s;erious Chri&s;ti|ans and learned divines, had all along complained of the imperfection of the Engli&s;h reformation; that, to the grief of other Prote&s;tant churches, it had oc|ca&s;ioned no &s;mall contention and &s;chi&s;m; that all &s;ubjects, being under the whole law of God, and bound to take care for their own and po&s;terity's eter|nal &s;alvation, ought to reform them&s;elves, if prin|ces be negligent or attached to prevalent corruptions; that, in the apo&s;tolical age, there was no difference between bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters; that not the prac|tice of the church &s;ome ages after Chri&s;t, or the con|&s;ent of Fathers, but the word of God, is our rule in religion; that it is now impo&s;&s;ible to know the univer&s;al practice of the primitive church, or the unanimous con&s;ent of the Fathers; that, according to the&s;e Fathers, the &s;criptures mu&s;t be interpreted by them&s;elves, and our faith not &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of men, but in the power of God;&mdash;that when the formal rea&s;on of an oath is removed, the obligation of it cea&s;eth; and when the Parliament repeal laws, the coronation oath doth not bind to oppo&s;e their deed; that his royal and learned father, never ad|mitted epi&s;copacy to be appointed by Chri&s;t or his
<PB N="215" REF="215">
apo&s;tles, and all the reforming divines, even of Eng|land, had reckoned it merely an human appoint|ment; that the We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly had proved Pre&s;byterian government founded on the &s;cripture; that magi&s;trates &s;upremacy over the church in &s;pi|ritual affairs, cannot be ju&s;tified from the word of God or right rea&s;on. The felt approaches of death, probably ha&s;tened by grief, that Charles, by his ob|&s;tinate refu&s;al to comply with his Parliament, was like to ruin him&s;elf and his kingdoms, obliged Mr. Hender&s;on to break off his an&s;wer to Charles' 4th letter, and retire to his country. The Epi&s;copalians gave out, that he died of remor&s;e, that he had oc|ca&s;ioned &s;o much trouble to &s;o pious a king, and publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed a forged recantation, as if made by him on te deathbed. But the General A&s;&s;embly declared it <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;candalous.</HI></P>
<P>Old General Le&s;ly, at the head of an hundred of his officers, on their knees, in an humble &s;upplica|tion, earne&s;tly be&s;ought Charles to &s;atisfy his Eng|li&s;h Parliament, and favour the &s;olemn league and covenant. Lord Lowdon repre&s;ented to him his ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of complying with their demands, if he inclined to keep the throne for him&s;elf, or his family. Meanwhile, the Independents and their friends, afraid of Charles' compliance with the Par|liament's demands, and particularly with Pre&s;by|tery by the Scots influence, got a vote carried in the Parliament, that there was no further need of their army in England. Hereupon their pay was withheld; their quarters were &s;traitened by the Parliament's forces; and they had almo&s;t nothing but the four northern counties to &s;upport them. Want of pay obliged them to take free quarters, which, by the Sectarians means, occa&s;ioned loud cries of oppre&s;&s;ion. They al&s;o publi&s;hed &s;currilous defamations of them, as covenant-breakers, apo&s;tates, and compliers with malignants. The&s;e and the like abu&s;es made the Scotch army heartily tired of England, and anxious to return home, a&s;&s;oon as they could &s;ecure the pay|ment
<PB N="216" REF="216">
of the arrears due to them. They produced proper claims for almo&s;t a million &s;terling: but, when the Engli&s;h offered them 200,000 pounds in hand, and &s;ecurity for 200,000 more, they, to te&s;tify their di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and love of peace, accepted it, September 2d, 1646, in place of full payment.</P>
<P>About &s;ixteen days after this pecuniary agreement was fully &s;ettled, Charles, in de&s;pite of all that had or could be &s;aid to per&s;uade him, refu&s;ed to comply with the Engli&s;h Parliament's propo&s;itions for peace. Hereupon that Parliament voted, that his per&s;on &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of as they thought fit. Again&s;t this deed the Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners earne&s;tly remon|&s;trated, and in&s;i&s;ted for a joint con&s;ultation with re|&s;pect to the di&s;po&s;al of his maje&s;ty's per&s;on. Low|don repre&s;ented to the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, That, by the <HI>&s;olemn league,</HI> both kingdoms were united to God, and to their king, and to one another; and that after the Scots had done &s;o much to promote the welfare of England, it was neither con&s;i&s;tent with honour, con&s;cience, or equity to di&s;po&s;e of his ma|je&s;ty's per&s;on, without con&s;ent of both kingdoms; and he, as in the above-mentioned remon&s;trance, in&s;i&s;ted that he might be allowed to re&s;ide in or near London, that &s;o an agreement between him and his Parliament might be &s;peedily effected;&mdash;or at lea&s;t that commi&s;&s;ioners might be again &s;ent to him to ex|plain their propo&s;itions, and endeavour to remove his &s;cruples. Argyle, in his addre&s;s to both hou&s;es of Parliament, begged them to promote the work of reformation according to the &s;olemn league, and nei|ther to per&s;ecute true piety, nor to allow lawle&s;s li|berty; and that they would endeavour to maintain the peace of the two kingdoms, and &s;tudy to reform, not ruin his maje&s;ty, and to regulate, but not de&s;|troy monarchy.</P>
<P>While the Scots were labouring to per&s;uade Charles to agree with his Engli&s;h Parliament, he, finding their army heartily attached to their &s;olemn league, &s;oon wearied of them, and repeatedly applied to his
<PB N="217" REF="217">
Engli&s;h Parliament for their allowance of his &s;afe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">welling in London or near to it. They appointed him Holmby in the county of Northampton for his re&s;idence, and agreed, That as &s;oon as he &s;hould come thither, and the Scots retire from England, they would concur with them in endeavouring to ob|tain his con&s;ent to their propo&s;itions. The&s;e re&s;o|lutions being tran&s;mitted to Charles, and to Scotland, the Parliament there earne&s;tly be&s;ought him to com|ply with the propo&s;als, &s;hewed him the rea&s;ons of &s;o doing, and the danger of his refu&s;ing, as they could not, in that ca&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;t him in recovering his king|dom; and that both kingdoms would be obliged to take &s;ome joint cour&s;e for di&s;po&s;ing of his per&s;on, till he &s;hould give &s;atisfaction to his Parliaments. While he was with the Scotch army, he earne&s;tly &s;olicited them to join with the Epi&s;copalians, that they might be enabled to de&s;troy their &s;ectarian ene|mies. But, his propo&s;als being laid before the A&s;|&s;embly in June, they declared as warmly again&s;t join|ing with the one as with the other. And the Com|mi&s;&s;ion in December, remon&s;trated again&s;t his com|ing to Scotland, as he would probably act up to his former principles, and endeavour to draw them from their <HI>&s;olemn league;</HI> and as it would confirm the Engli&s;h in their &s;u&s;picions of underhand dealing with him, before he came to their army; and as it would involve them in breach of covenant, and a bloody war with England.</P>
<P>When the Scotch Parliament met in January 1647, they, con&s;idering, that notwith&s;tanding his promi&s;e to their army when he came to it, and the many addre&s;&s;es pre&s;ented to him from this kingdom, he continued &s;tifly to refu&s;e the propo&s;itions, which the Engli&s;h Parliament had made to him; and that he had reque&s;ted &s;aid Parliament for allowance to re|&s;ide in or near London, and they had allowed him to re&s;ide at Holmby hou&s;e, they con&s;ented that he repair to either of the&s;e places, and there remain, till he &s;hould give &s;atisfaction to both kingdoms with

<P>Not &s;atisfied with this declaration, the Commi&s;&s;i|on, April 28th, remon&s;trated, That the breach o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> covenant was not chargeable upon all the Engli&s;h&punc; but merely upon the Sectarians, as it was no le&s;s up|on the malignants in Scotland; that &s;uch as encou|raged his maje&s;ty to decline giving &s;atisfaction, rela|tive to his &s;ecuring of religion, hindered his delive|rance; that they could not prove upon the Engli&s;h Parliament any &s;uch breaches of treaty, as could be &s;ufficient grounds of a war with them; that it would be incon&s;i&s;tent to de&s;ire the Engli&s;h Parliament to hold all the refu&s;ers of the <HI>&s;olemn league</HI> as enemies to religion and their country, while no &s;uch penalty had ever been executed again&s;t the &s;hifters of it in Scotland; that they ought not to in&s;i&s;t for his ma|je&s;ty's being allowed to re&s;ide in or near London&punc; without in&s;i&s;ting for his giving &s;atisfaction to his Parliament, concerning the &s;ecurity of their religion and peace of the kingdom; that there was as much need for preventing the ri&s;e of a Popi&s;h or prelatical party in the army, as for di&s;banding the Sectarians&punc; &mdash;and that the propo&s;ed engagement in war with the Engli&s;h, plainly tended to prevent the di&s;banding o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Sectarian army.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding this remon|&s;trance, the Scotch Parliament tran&s;mitted their de|mands to the Engli&s;h Parliament, and publi&s;hed their above mentioned <HI>declaration.</HI> The Commi&s;&s;ion, heartily grieved herewith, emitted a declaration, bearing, That they were ready to agree to the nati|on's engaging in a war with the Engli&s;h, if they were &s;atisfied concerning the &s;ufficiency of the grounds, and the lawfulne&s;s of the means for carrying it on.

favourable to the Popi&s;h, Prelatic, and malignant party,&mdash;incon&s;i&s;tent with the union of the kingdoms, and the &s;atisfaction of the Pre&s;byterians in England, and therefore contrary to the word of God and our &s;olemn covenants;&mdash;and that the managers of it pretended zeal again&s;t the Sectarians, merely for a cloak to the favour which they intended for malig|nants; and had even lately pled, That Scotland was in no danger from the Sectaries. Highly offended with the faithful oppo&s;ition of the Commi&s;&s;ion, the Parliament &s;ent letters to the several Pre&s;byteries complaining of it;&mdash;in an&s;wer to which the com|mi&s;&s;ion publi&s;hed a <HI>vindication</HI> of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Several Synods, Pre&s;byteries, and &s;hires, again petitioned the Parliament, That religion might be &s;ecured, and the union of the kingdoms pre&s;erved, and no war commenced without very weighty grounds maturely con&s;idered. The Parliament, after they had framed an an&s;wer to the&s;e, laid it a&s;ide, and pretended to a&s;k the advice of the commi&s;&s;ion con|cerning the proper method of &s;ecuring religion. Af|ter te&s;tifying their regard to the Parliament, and to his maje&s;ty's liberty and honour, they advi&s;ed, that the&s;e petitions &s;hould be granted; that the &s;urpriz|ing of Berwick and Carli&s;le be di&s;claimed, and no longer continued; that all peaceable methods of treating with England, and &s;upplication to his ma|je&s;ty be further tried, in order to compo&s;e differen|ces; that his conce&s;&s;ions mentioned by Lowdon be declared un&s;atisfactory; that they declare again&s;t any engagement for re&s;toring him to his hou&s;e with free|dom and &s;afety, which is almo&s;t equivalent to his having the exerci&s;e of his royal power, before he gave it under his hand and &s;eal, That he &s;hall, for him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, agree to the acts of Parlia|ment enjoining the <HI>&s;olemn league</HI> and <HI>covenant,</HI> and fully e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>Pre&s;byterian government,</HI> the <HI>direc|tory for wor&s;hip,</HI> and <HI>confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> in all his do|minions, and never make oppo&s;ition to, or endea|vour a change of any of them; that they &s;hould

make it evident, that they have no intention to enable his maje&s;ty to bring the proceedings of both nations relative to the &s;olemn league, into que&s;tion, or to abridge the power of his Parliaments; that they &s;hould take proper methods to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch Papi&s;ts, prelati&s;ts, or malignants, as had, or might take arms, to plunder and murder their fellow &s;ubjects; that nothing be done which may infringe the union of the two kingdoms, or di&s;oblige the Pre&s;byterian party in England; that all putting of &s;uch as had been indifferent neutrals, or oppo&s;ers of a covenan|ted reformation, into places of power and tru&s;t, &s;hould be quickly remedied; that there &s;hould be no engagement for the war without a &s;olemn oath, in which the church &s;hould have the &s;ame direction, as in the <HI>&s;olemn league;</HI> that &s;uch as have been op|pre&s;&s;ed for not contributing to the levies for the ar|my be refunded, and no &s;uch thing permitted for the future; that the profanene&s;s and in&s;olence of &s;oldiers be &s;everely puni&s;hed; that nothing be enac|ted detrimental to the liberty of the church, and no arbitrary power intru&s;ted to their officers or agents; ar any oath impo&s;ed tending to en&s;nare the con&s;ci|ences of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Regardle&s;s of the&s;e advices, the Parliament ap|pointed an army to be immediately rai&s;ed under the command of duke Hamilton, and the earl of Callen|der as his lieutenant; and laid an enormous tax up|on the nation, for defraying the expences of the war. Argyle, Sutherland, Ca&s;&s;ils, Eglinton, Lowdon, and Lothian, with many other lords, barons, and bur|ge&s;&s;es, prote&s;ted again&s;t their <HI>engagement.</HI> Colonels Ker, Strachan, Halket, and other officers, refu&s;ed to &s;erve in it; and had their places filled with &s;can|dalous malignants. Such as refu&s;ed to pay the new tax, were terribly oppre&s;&s;ed and &s;poiled by &s;oldiers quartered upon them. The Parliament next pre|pared a <HI>declaration</HI> to be &s;ent into England, recount|ing all that they thought criminal in the conduct of the &s;ectaries, and pretending that, as they had got
<PB N="227" REF="227">
no &s;atisfaction to their former demands, they had been nece&s;&s;arily obliged to this engagement in war; that they intended to pre&s;erve the reformation of re|ligion as e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in Scotland, and to re&s;cue his maje&s;ty from his ba&s;e impri&s;onment, that he may with &s;afety and honour come to one of his hou&s;es in, or near London, where he may treat with his Parliament,&mdash;and to re&s;tore freedom to his Engli&s;h Parliament, that they, together with the Scotch, might conclude the treaty with their Sovereign, an|&s;werably to the petitions pre&s;ented to him by the city of London, at Oxford and Newca&s;tle;&mdash;and to pro|cure the di&s;banding of the army under general Fair|fax,&mdash;and that none but covenanters and well affec|ted to religion and Pre&s;byterian church government, might hereafter be employed in troops, or garri&s;ons. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e pretences, many notorious malignants were principal agents in carrying on this engagement. Hence, the more &s;erious covenanters, generally di&s;liked, and, as they had opportunity, op|po&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The General A&s;&s;embly, which met July 12th, 1648, approved and ratified the proceedings of the late commi&s;&s;ion. The committee of E&s;tates, which the late Parliament had entru&s;ted with the execution of their de&s;igns, demanded, what they thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring of religion? The A&s;&s;embly re|plied, that they knew no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ecuring re|ligion, while this unlawful engagement was carried on, &s;ince none of the ju&s;t de&s;ires of the late commi&s;|&s;ion had been granted; that it was plainly calculated to break the union of the two kingdoms; that all proper means to prevent a war have been neglected, and malignants and incendiaries, have been joined with; that it hath been carried on in the way of polluting men's con&s;ciences by unlawful bands and oaths, and of oppre&s;&s;ing &s;uch in their per&s;ons and e&s;tates as had been mo&s;t zealous for the covenanted intere&s;t,&mdash;and of remarkable encroachments on the liberty of Chri&s;t's church. The committee there|fore
<PB N="228" REF="228">
required them, to demon&s;trate from the word of God, the unlawfulne&s;s of their <HI>engagement,</HI> and what intere&s;t the church had in the undertaking of wars; in an&s;wer to which the A&s;&s;embly emitted a large <HI>declaration,</HI> plainly illu&s;trating both the&s;e points from the &s;cripture. And, as the Parliament had re|quired all the &s;ubjects under pain of being held ene|mies to their king and country, &s;olemnly, by their oath and &s;ub&s;cription, to acknowledge all their acts relative to the engagement to be lawful, and to en|gage to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame as a mo&s;t proper mean of remedying former evils, and of pre&s;erving his ma|je&s;ty's authority along with the religion, laws, and liberties of the kingdom, the A&s;&s;embly declared&punc; That a &s;inful oath, tending to draw the &s;ubjects from their former principles and covenant with God, and importing a &s;olemn approbation of acts, which they had not yet &s;een,&mdash;of acts made in oppo&s;ition to the known mind of the church, and &s;inful in &s;everal re|&s;pects; and they warned all concerned to forbear &s;wearing of it, under pain of cen&s;ure; and they earne&s;tly be&s;ought the committee of E&s;tates, to con|&s;ider, what guilt they would incur by impo&s;ing &s;uch a &s;inful bond. They al&s;o remon&s;trated to his maje&s;ty, that his conce&s;&s;ions were not &s;atisfactory; and that the pre&s;ent engagement in war was not a proper mean of his deliverance; and that by his former re|fu&s;als to hearken to their advice, he had occa&s;ioned the death of many thou&s;ands of his &s;ubjects, and the fearful increa&s;e of Popery, profanene&s;s, and many other abominations, in his kingdom; and they be&s;ought him deeply to repent of his wickedne&s;s, &s;ecret and open, as a true mean of re&s;toration to his throne.&mdash;They appointed all mini&s;ters, under pain of cen&s;ure, to preach again&s;t the above engagement and bond, as well as the Sectarian errors, and in|crea&s;ing profanene&s;s. They appointed, that none but elders approved by the mini&s;ter and &s;e&s;&s;ion, be ad|mitted into the A&s;&s;embly as commi&s;&s;ioners from burghs; that commi&s;&s;ioners report their whole pro|cedure

to the next A&s;&s;embly at their fir&s;t meeting; that no collections for the poor, be made in the time of God's wor&s;hip; that no depo&s;ed mini&s;ters be re|poned without the con&s;ent of the A&s;&s;embly, if ma|lignant, to his former congregation; that forty high|land boys be educated for the mini&s;try at the public expence, in order to plant the vacant congregations in that country; that all &s;tudents, at their entry to the college, and others at their admi&s;&s;ion to the Lord's table, take the covenant; that <HI>duellers</HI> be cen&s;ured in much the &s;ame manner as <HI>fornicators.</HI> They approved the <HI>Larger and Shorter Catechi&s;ms,</HI> compiled by the We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly; and prohi|bited an erroneous catechi&s;m then publi&s;hed. After con&s;ideration of the prevalent &s;ins of that time, they pointed out proper remedies, civil, dome&s;tic, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and approved &s;everal overtures relative to excommunicated per&s;ons, Papi&s;ts, and their chil|dren. They returned friendly an&s;wers to &s;everal letters &s;ent them from the We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly, and appointed their commi&s;&s;ioners in it to exert them|&s;elves to their utmo&s;t for promoting a full and fixed uniformity in religion. And, as the times were &s;o critical, they appointed a large commi&s;&s;ion of 100 mini&s;ters, and 60 elders, of whom 13 mini&s;ters, and four elders were declared a quorum.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all oppo&s;ition, duke Hamilton, Lanerk his brother, and their friends carried on the <HI>engagement,</HI> and invaded England, &s;till pretend|ing regard to the covenant and Pre&s;byterian govern|ment.

Shocked with the&s;e things, both church and &s;tate appointed their commi&s;&s;ioners at London to exert them&s;elves to their utmo&s;t for preventing his trial.

They wrote a brotherly exhortation to their friends in Eng|land, bewailing the broken &s;tate of their church and kingdom, and be&s;eeching and encouraging them to cleave to their duty according to their covenant with God. In a letter to their young king, they declared their dete&s;tation of the murder of his father, and la|mented that he him&s;elf had contemned the repre&s;en|tations pre&s;ented to him by the church's commi&s;&s;io|ners;&mdash;held an intimacy with Montro&s;e, a perjured murderer of many thou&s;ands of his be&s;t &s;ubjects, and approved his conduct;&mdash;and had &s;ettled a peace with the Popi&s;h murderers in Ireland, and granted them a peace, and the full liberty of their idolatry and o|ther abominations;&mdash;and be&s;ought him, as he re|garded his own and his kingdom's happine&s;s, to &s;ub|mit to the laws of Chri&s;t, and the coun&s;els of truth and peace.

Thus multitudes <HI>then,</HI> and <HI>ever &s;ince,</HI> have been admitted to be the <HI>mini&s;ters of God for good</HI> to the nation, in a way of trampling on the law of God, and plain violation of our &s;olemn covenants with him.

<P>The&s;e reque&s;ts and propo&s;als being altogether di&s;|regarded, they pre&s;ented another paper, in which they ob&s;erve, how they had been contemned; how an A&s;&s;embly indicted by the null meeting of Dundee, had been pretended to be the only method of healing their divi&s;ions; how the&s;e, once hearty promoters of Prelacy, having gotten the a&s;cendant in judicato|ries,
<PB N="251" REF="251">
had more than ever manife&s;ted their contempt of their covenant engagements, and covenanted re|formation,&mdash;and had become per&s;ecutors of &s;uch as were endeavouring faithfully to adhere to the Lord and his cau&s;e, according to their &s;olemn vows:&mdash; they declare their adherence to their former te&s;timo|nies again&s;t their apo&s;tacy, and prote&s;t, That the con&s;titution and acts of this A&s;&s;embly &s;hall be held <HI>null</HI> and <HI>void,</HI> and not binding by virtue of any au|thority derived from them. (1.) Becau&s;e it derived its indiction and authority from the pretended A&s;&s;em|bly of St. Andrews and Dundee la&s;t year. (2.) It is for the mo&s;t part con&s;tituted of the &s;ame kind of per&s;ons as it, who have begun, &s;upported, and car|ried on a cour&s;e of defection, contrary to the word of God, and the covenants and con&s;titutions of this church. (3.) Becau&s;e, by the act of that pretended A&s;&s;embly, la&s;t year, which required all Pre&s;byteries and Synods to inflict cen&s;ures upon all mini&s;ters, pro|bationers, &s;tudents, and private Chri&s;tians, who op|po&s;ed the <HI>public re&s;olutions,</HI> and did not acquie&s;ce in their acts,&mdash;all oppo&s;ers are rendered incapable of e|lection, and in con&s;equence of it, &s;everal Synods and Pre&s;byteries, in their approbation of the deeds of that A&s;&s;embly, had made &s;everal prelimitations. (4.) Many Pre&s;byteries had refu&s;ed to &s;end up com|mi&s;&s;ioners to this meeting, as a General A&s;&s;embly of the church of Scotland; and the election of &s;uch as have come up as commi&s;&s;ioners, is generally contro|verted.&mdash;Regardle&s;s of all the&s;e things, the A&s;&s;em|bly proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s, and enacted, That &s;can|dalous mini&s;ters or others &s;hould be duly re&s;tored to their office and church fellow&s;hip, not without evi|dence of thorough repentance; and that none &s;hould be licen&s;ed to preach the go&s;pel, or ordained to be mi|ni&s;ters or ruling elders, or be commi&s;&s;ioned to Pre&s;|byteries or Synods, before they give it under their hand, that they approve of the <HI>public re&s;olutions,</HI> or at lea&s;t will never make any oppo&s;ition to them:&mdash; but refu&s;ed to approve a declaration in favours of
<PB N="252" REF="252">
Independency and toleration of errors, which &s;ome of the Engli&s;h had pre&s;ented to them.&mdash;&mdash;Finding the Scotch clergy extremely attached to their king, Cromwel would not allow them to hold any more General A&s;&s;emblies; and &s;ometimes his officers drove them out of their Synods. This did the le&s;s hurt, as the re&s;olutioners, in their courts, chiefly aimed at &s;upporting their own authority, and cru&s;hing their prote&s;ting brethren.</P>
<P>Deprived of civil a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Charles and his malignant favourites, to per&s;ecute the <HI>prote&s;tors</HI> by fines, impri&s;onment, or death, the public re&s;oluti|oners per&s;ecuted them with manifold reproaches, as ruiners of their king and country,&mdash;as favourers of the Engli&s;h &s;ectaries and their u&s;urpations,&mdash;as ren|ters of the church, and the like; and laboured to their utmo&s;t to keep the&s;e of their principles from any mini&s;terial charges, which, in divers places, oc|ca&s;ioned a prote&s;ting mini&s;ter and a re&s;olutioner in the &s;ame congregation. So terrible were their tor|rents of reproach and calumny, that even principal Bailie, notwith&s;tanding all his coolne&s;s, prudence, piety, and learning, appears, in his letters, ready to receive and &s;pread ill grounded calumnies to blacken the characters of his mo&s;t eminent, and, a little be|fore, dearly beloved brethren. The uncommonly meek and calm Mr. Guthrie of Stirling he repre&s;ents as a kind of forward flaming fire-brand; the almo&s;t too peaceful Mr. Living&s;ton as a violent pu&s;her; the pious and learned Mr. Sim&s;on of Airth as an arrant fool; holy Rutherfoord, and uniting Durham and Blair as working the ruin of the church; great M'Ward as guilty of being Rutherfoord's &s;ervant; and pious Andrew Gray and Hugh Binning, who&s;e &s;ermons the Lord then, and &s;ince, hath &s;o remark|ably ble&s;&s;ed, as romantic, new-fa&s;hioned, and un|&s;ub&s;tantial preachers; and, in &s;hort, the prote&s;tors &s;ettlements of mini&s;ters, carriage in judicatories, and at &s;olemn fa&s;ts, and &s;acramental occa&s;ions, which
<PB N="253" REF="253">
were attended with &s;uch marvellous power from on high, as a &s;cene of di&s;order, pride, and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>But the more their brethren reproached and per|&s;ecuted them as they could, the more the Lord coun|tenanced their labours, and made them &s;ing as in the days of their youth, about 1638 and 1649. Re|markably warned of, and dreading times of re&s;traint, they were exceedingly diligent in their mini&s;trations, and the&s;e were attended with amazing &s;ucce&s;s. Mul|titudes of the mo&s;t &s;erious attended their many <HI>&s;olemn fa&s;ts</HI> and their &s;acramental occa&s;ions; and &s;o mar|vellous was the influence they felt, that they were often in a kind of &s;piritual trance the whole time. After one &s;acramental occa&s;ion, about &s;ixty of the aged hearers, earne&s;tly applied them&s;elves to learn, that they might <HI>read</HI> the word of God.&mdash;"I have been many years" &s;ays Mr. Kirkton in his MSS me|moirs "in a pari&s;h, where I never heard an oath; and one might have rode many miles without hear|ing one. In a great part of the country, one could not have lodged in a family, where God was not dai|ly wor&s;hipped by reading, &s;inging of p&s;alms, and prayer. People were generally &s;o &s;ober, that the inn-keepers complained of the ruin of their trade." The Lord al&s;o gave them peculiar favour in the &s;ight of the Engli&s;h invaders, who reli&s;hed their unfavour|able apprehen&s;ions of K. Charles, and his malignants, Prelati&s;ts, and Papi&s;ts,&mdash;and repeatedly offered them the government of the country, which they always refu&s;ed. And indeed none were more zealous again&s;t compliance with Cromwel and his &s;ectaries, or for continued praying for Charles, than Lord Warri&s;ton, Mr. James Guthry, and other principal men among the <HI>Prote&s;tors.</HI> Even Argyle fell under their frown for &s;ome involuntary compliances that he had made.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h had the whole civil government of the nation in their hands. No newly placed mini&s;ter could plead in law for his &s;tipend, without a warrant from &s;ome of their judges. The Engli&s;h Parliament even gave their judges and &s;eque&s;trators a power to put
<PB N="254" REF="254">
out &s;candalous mini&s;ters or teachers in univer&s;ities, and prohibited mini&s;ters public praying for Charles as their king, under pain of lo&s;ing their &s;tipend. This both Prote&s;tors and Re&s;olutioners refu&s;ed to comply with; and &s;uch was their zeal for their wic|ked and treacherous prince, that the Lord's &s;upper was not di&s;pen&s;ed for &s;ome years in Edinburgh and &s;everal other places, becau&s;e they &s;crupled to admit the magi&s;trates to it, who had been obliged to crouch under the Engli&s;h conquerors. By means of Dur|ham, Blair, and &s;ome other pacificators, the Prote&s;|tors and Re&s;olutioners had &s;everal conferences in or|der to agreement in 1655; and the matter was car|ried up before Cromwel, who had u&s;urped the go|vernment of Britain; but without any effect. Wea|ried of the &s;crupulo&s;ity of the Prote&s;tors, and court|ed with large offers by Sharp, afterward archbi&s;hop, in name of the Re&s;olutioners, he gave both parties an equal liberty. As he indulged the Sectaries which abounded in his time with liberty to &s;pread their prin|ciples, and to re&s;train the Pre&s;byterians from foi&s;ting into their cau&s;es of fa&s;ting any thing in favours of Charles or again&s;t him&s;elf or his government, had taken the power of appointing general fa&s;ts, and fix|ing the cau&s;es thereof next to wholly into his own hands,&mdash;Rutherfoord and &s;ixteen other Prote&s;tors, in the counties of Fife and Perth, emitted a &s;olemn <HI>te&s;timony</HI> again&s;t the&s;e things, and in behalf of their covenanted reformation.</P>
<P>During the confu&s;ions, which happened after Cromwel's death in 1658, both Prote&s;tors and Re|&s;olutioners appeared pretty calm, and agreed to bury their differences.&mdash;In&s;tigated by Me&s;&s;rs. Robert Dou|glas, and James Sharp, Monk, who had command|ed the Engli&s;h forces in Scotland for &s;everal years, undertook to re&s;tore Charles to his throne, and, by the vile&s;t perjury and treachery, got it accompli&s;hed. Charles him&s;elf was wearied of his mi&s;erable and pinched circum&s;tances abroad, and &s;tuck at no di&s;&s;i|mulation by letters, to per&s;uade the nation of his vir|tues
<PB N="255" REF="255">
and good intentions. The nobles at home di&s;|dained crouching to Engli&s;hmen of no rank in the world. The &s;ubjects in general were tired of an un|&s;ettled government. Such as thought they had &s;erved Charles, though but in pillaging their neigh|bours hou&s;es, expected that he would richly reward them: his friends in general highly extolled his ex|cellencies. And though, in his travels, he had &s;o|lemnly profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Papi&s;t, &s;ome divines re|pre&s;ented him as the great in&s;trument by which God would fulfil the promi&s;es of Antichri&s;t's de&s;truction. Sharp, whom the Re&s;olutioners cho&s;e for their agent, to concert matters with General Monk and Charles, and to take care that no injury might be done to their church, notwith&s;tanding his mo&s;t &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ions of &s;incerity, betrayed them, and concerted with Charles, how to introduce Epi&s;copacy, in reward of which Charles gave him 20 chalders of corn, and the archbi&s;hoprick of St. Andrews; and, in the mean time, &s;tirred them up again&s;t the Prote&s;tors, whom he repre&s;ented as abhorred by his maje&s;ty; &s;o that it is hard to &s;ay, if the Prelatic per&s;ecution made their circum&s;tances a whit wor&s;e, than the Re&s;olutioners would have made them.</P>
<P>Convinced, that the Prote&s;tors would oppo&s;e their introduction of Prelacy, Charles and Sharp heartily agreed to ruin the principal of them as quickly as po&s;&s;ible. Charles therefore gave orders to impri&s;on the Marquis of Argyle, Lord Warri&s;ton, Sir James Stewart, provolt of Edinburgh, and Sir John Chief|ly, who &s;hewed the mo&s;t bold oppo&s;ition to the be|heading of his father; while he advanced to honour Sir John Fletcher, who had, among the fir&s;t, ab|jured him&s;elf, and Middleton and Sharp, who had &s;hewed not a little forwardne&s;s in taking the <HI>engage|ment</HI> of fidelity to the Engli&s;h commonwealth.&mdash; Sometime after, a &s;olemn thank&s;giving for Charles' re&s;toration, at Edinburgh, the afternoon of which was &s;pent in horrid drunkenne&s;s, debauchery, and madne&s;s,&mdash;the committee of E&s;tates appointed by the
<PB N="256" REF="256">
Parliament in 1651, all the members of which had concurred with their &s;overeign in taking the <HI>nationa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> covenant</HI> and <HI>&s;olemn league,</HI> and &s;ome of them had advi&s;ed him to make that <HI>&s;olemn declaration</HI> at Dun|fermline, Aug. 16th, 1650, met on the 2d of Aug. 1660.&mdash;Finding, that the Re&s;olutioners would nei|ther join with their prote&s;ting brethren to form a &s;upplication to his maje&s;ty, nor form one by them|&s;elves, Mr. James Guthry, and nine other mini&s;ters&punc; and two elders, met in a private hou&s;e in Edinburgh&punc; to form a draught of a &s;upplication to be laid before a larger meeting of their brethren, particularly the Synod of Gla&s;gow. In this draught, they repre&s;en|ted to his maje&s;ty, how hateful the procedure of the late u&s;urpers had been to them, in offering violence to the Parliament of England, in murdering his roy|al father, and in &s;ecluding him&s;elf from his govern|ment, and in their impious encroachments upon the kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;how thankfully they acknowledged the Lord's &s;ignal pre&s;ervation of his maje&s;ty's per&s;on, and in re&s;toring him to his throne; &mdash;how they did, and re&s;olved to pour forth their fer|vent &s;upplications to God for him; and hoped, that he would protect, countenance, and encourage them as their gracious &s;overeign,&mdash;what dangers threaten|ed religion and the work of reformation in the&s;e kingdoms, from the unremitted endeavours of Pa|pi&s;ts, Prelati&s;ts, and malignants on the one hand, and of the Sectaries on the other; and therefore humbly be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to employ his royal power for the pre&s;ervation of the reformed religion, in doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline and government in the church of Scotland; and for the reformation of religion in England and Ireland;&mdash;and that all places of tru&s;t might be filled with &s;uch as have taken the covenant, and are of approved integrity and known affection to the cau&s;e of God;&mdash;and that his maje&s;ty would remove the <HI>ceremonies</HI> and <HI>&s;ervice book</HI> from his church and family, and from other places of his do|minions, and publicly &s;ignify his approbation of the
<PB N="257" REF="257">
covenant, into which he had &s;o &s;olemnly entered, and of his purpo&s;e to adhere to it,&mdash;as it was the de&s;ire of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir &s;oul, that he might be like David, a man accor|ding to God's own heart, and to Solomon, of an un|der&s;tanding heart to judge the Lord's people, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The committee, hearing of their meeting, cau&s;ed ap|prehend them all, except one elder that e&s;caped, and without hearing them, impri&s;oned them in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, from whence the Parliament next <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear liberated them all, except Mr. Guthry. Next day, the committee emitted a proclamation again&s;t all unlawful meetings, without his maje&s;ty's &s;pecial authority, and again&s;t all &s;editious petitions and re|mon&s;trances, as every faithful one was now called.</P>
<P>By a flattering letter directed from Charles to the re&s;olutioners of the Pre&s;bytery of Edinburgh, in which he promi&s;ed to &s;upport their cau&s;e, and main|tain their religion, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed;&mdash;by a pro|clamation again&s;t Rutherfoord's <HI>Lex rex,</HI> and the <HI>cau&s;es of God's wrath,</HI> as containing many things in|jurious to his maje&s;ty, and laying the foundation and &s;eeds of rebellion, and the burning of what copies they could find, at Edinburgh, by the hangman;&mdash; and by a proclamation again&s;t <HI>Remon&s;trants</HI> and their <HI>adherents</HI>;&mdash;and by the confinement or impri&s;onment of &s;ome gentlemen or mini&s;ters, that they might have no influence upon the elections for the en&s;uing Parliament, or citing them to it as criminals,&mdash;pre|paration was made for its being wholly complai&s;ant. Great care was taken, that none &s;hould be elected commi&s;&s;ioners, but &s;uch as &s;hould in all things be &s;ub&s;ervient to the will of the court. For this rea&s;on, it &s;eems none el&s;e could be found fit in the burgh of Lanerk, but their <HI>piper.</HI> And care was taken to have the elections of tho&s;e that were otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed &s;et a&s;ide. The mo&s;t part of the members were ab|&s;olutely infamous, who wallowed in profanene&s;s, whoredom, and drunkenne&s;s. Only Lowdon, Ca&s;|&s;ils, Sutherland, Crawford, Borthwick, Torphichen,
<PB N="258" REF="258">
and a few other old covenanters, who often di&s;&s;ent|ed from the deeds of the re&s;t, retained their wonted &s;obriety. And indeed, drunkenne&s;s, whoredom, cur&s;ing and bla&s;phemy, were now reckoned badges of loyalty; and piety, or even common gravity, a mark of rebellion. Charles him&s;elf appears to have been a profligate Athei&s;t, abandoned to profane &s;wearing, drunkenne&s;s and whoredom, and capable of the mo&s;t ba&s;e di&s;&s;imulation. Sharp, his director and agent, was chiefly remarkable for activity, craft, and di&s;&s;imulation. Such as were intimately acquain|ted with him, reckoned him a downright Athei&s;t, who affected to believe, That there was neither God, hea|ven nor hell; he u&s;ed no private prayer, and &s;carcely had prayer in his family once a month; he lived, who knows how long, in whoredom with one I&s;obel Lind|&s;ay, and with his own hand &s;trangled the child, which &s;he bare to him. And there is not a little ground to believe, that he had entered into a &s;olemn compact with the devil, in order to pre&s;erve his life and carry on his de&s;igos.</P>
<P>The Parliament having met on the 21&s;t of Ja|nuary, 1661, after a faithful &s;ermon from Mr. Rob. Douglas, would choo&s;e their after preachers for them&s;elves; who, by their ful&s;ome harangues, ex|cited them to render his maje&s;ty ab&s;olute, and to e&s;|tabli&s;h &s;ome greater authority in the church to keep her mini&s;ters in order. Highly plea&s;ed with &s;uch &s;tuff, the Parliament appointed a new <HI>oath of allegi|ance,</HI> acknowledging the king's &s;upremacy over all per&s;ons, and in <HI>all cau&s;es.</HI> They enacted, That no conventions, leagues, or bonds, &s;hould be made without his maje&s;ty's con&s;ent, and prohibited the renewing of the &s;olemn league and covenant, or any other covenants or public oaths concerning the go|vernment of the church or kingdom, without his &s;pecial warrant and approbation; and appointed all per&s;ons in public offices to &s;wear the <HI>oath of allegiance</HI> or <HI>&s;upremacy</HI> before mentioned, and &s;ub&s;cribe the <HI>de|claration</HI> a&s;&s;erting his maje&s;ty's prerogative; bearing,
<PB N="259" REF="259">
that it was his and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;ole right, to choo&s;e and appoint officers of &s;tate, privy coun&s;ellors and lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion;&mdash;and to call, hold, and di&s;&s;olve all Parliaments and other conventions of the &s;tates; that no acts of Parliament are binding without his &s;pecial approbation or commi&s;&s;ion; that the power of mak|ing peace or war doth only re&s;ide in him, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; that it is <HI>high trea&s;on</HI> for any &s;ubjects to ri&s;e or continue in arms without his au|thority, or to meet for determining any matters, ci|vil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, except in the ordinary judgments, &mdash;or to make leagues and bonds, without his &s;pecial con&s;ent; that the &s;olemn league and covenant, and all treaties following upon it, are <HI>not obligatory</HI> upon any of the &s;ubjects of this kingdom; and that none could lawfully require the renewing of &s;aid covenant, or any other covenant, or renew the &s;ame, without his maje&s;ty's &s;pecial warrant and approbation: They declared the convention of E&s;tates 1643, which enjoin|ed the &s;olemn league and covenant, and all the Par|liaments between 1640 and 1649, inclu&s;ively, <HI>void</HI> and <HI>null</HI> in their very <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> and &s;o their deeds of no authority. They declared, that the Prote&s;tant religion was &s;ettled as before 1638, and the govern|ment of the church &s;hould be &s;ecured as his maje&s;ty found mo&s;t proper. They appointed the 29th of May to be kept as a <HI>yearly thank&s;giving</HI> to God; and by the preamble of this act, they laboured to bring in God and all the &s;ubjects as approvers of their fore|mentioned acts, and as &s;olemn reproachers of the whole covenanted work of reformation. And, in|fine, they re&s;tored Patronages, and required all pre|&s;entees to take the above <HI>oath of allegiance</HI> and <HI>decla|ration.</HI> The Parliament confirmed their &s;tatutes with the blood of the marquis of Argyle, who&s;e e&s;|tate Middleton the pre&s;ident expected, and of Mr. James Guthry, and with the harra&s;&s;ment, impri&s;on|ment, or bani&s;hment of his fellow petitioners, and other prote&s;tors;&mdash;mo&s;t of whom had &s;uffered for their attachment to his maje&s;ty, during Cromwel's

u&s;urpation. Had not God removed Rutherfoord by a triumphant death, he had al&s;o been &s;acrificed&punc; Meanwhile, by the influence of the re&s;olutioners&punc; and by the courts di&s;&s;olution of Synods, and by the general fainting of mini&s;ters, or their divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, not one judicial te&s;timony was lifted up again&s;t the wickedne&s;s of the Parliament, in Scot|land.</P>
<P>After the ri&s;e of the Parliament, Charles, in&s;tigat|ed by Middleton and Sharp, and a&s;&s;ured that the be&s;t part of the nation earne&s;tly wi&s;hed it, and that not &s;o much as twenty of the re&s;olutioners would oppo&s;e it,&mdash;by a proclamation, founded on his new|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;upremacy,&mdash;e&s;tabli&s;hed Epi&s;copalian government. Sharp was made archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, and Fairfoul of Gla&s;gow, under whom twelve others were made bi&s;hops. None of them had the lea&s;t appearance of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, except Leigh|ton of Dumblain. Meanwhile the earl of Tweedale was impri&s;oned for &s;ome words he had &s;poken in fa|vours of Mr. Guthry, and his not voting for his death. The privy council emitted a proclamation, prohibiting the election of any for magi&s;trates or coun&s;ellors in burghs, that were not hearty for bi&s;h|ops and the king's arbitrary power. And to prevent the printing or &s;pread of &s;uch &s;candalous and &s;editious papers, as Argyle's and Guthry's dying words, the <HI>covenanters plea,</HI> &amp;c. they prohibited the printing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any books or papers, without warrant from the king or Parliament.

In con&s;equence whereof, per&s;ons were called before them without information, accu&s;ation, or witne&s;s; and required to an&s;wer whatever que&s;tions were propo&s;|ed. If any offered any legal defence, he was required to take the <HI>oath of &s;upremacy,</HI> the refu&s;al of which was reckoned &s;ufficient guilt. They, in the manner of the Spani&s;h inqui&s;ition, and the privy council, in their wonted manner, proceeded to ruin every &s;eri|ous oppo&s;er. Such non-conform mini&s;ters, as yet remained in their charges by the favour of &s;ome of the nobility, or the like, were driven from them, and &s;oldiers were appointed to force people, who ab&s;ent|ed from the &s;ermons of their intruded curates, to pay twenty-pence for every time they &s;hould be ab&s;ent. Be&s;ides &s;everal proclamations for enforcing or exe|cuting the above mentioned acts of Parliament again&s;t non-conformi&s;ts and preachers, or attenders upon religious meetings not allowed by law, they emitted one again&s;t Brown's <HI>apologetical relation of the &s;uffer|ings of the faithful mini&s;ters and profe&s;&s;ors of that pe|riod,</HI> and ordered it to be burnt in the &s;treet of E|dinburgh by the hangman; and all that had copies of it to deliver them up to their &s;herriffs, or be liable to a fine of 2000 pounds Scots: and Mr. James Guthrie's widow and daughter were pro&s;ecuted for having it.</P>
<P>In 1666, the remains of the fines impo&s;ed by the Parliament of 1662, for &s;ome trifling compliances with the Engli&s;h u&s;urpers, or the like, were exacted with rigour by the king's troops, who took free quarters till they got them: no excu&s;e was accepted, unle&s;s by taking the oath of &s;upremacy, and &s;ub|&s;cribing the declaration; and &s;uch as could neither pay their fines, nor entertain the troops, were drag|ged to pri&s;on. Sir James Turner and his &s;oldiers were empowered to &s;ine the we&s;t country people for
<PB N="267" REF="267">
non-attendance on the mini&s;trations of their profligate curates,&mdash;and even to &s;ine gentlemen, if their ladies or &s;ervants did not attend; and to quarter on te|nants, if their landlords withdrew. No widowhood or poverty excu&s;ed from the fines. The &s;oldiers &s;natched the meat from the mouths of innocent chil|dren, and gave it to their dogs; and when they had con&s;umed all the provi&s;ion, they &s;old or burnt the furniture. In this manner, Turner and his troops levied almo&s;t 60,000 pounds Scots, from the two &s;hires of Galloway and Dumfries for their non-con|formity.&mdash;&mdash;Being obliged to give up the infamous <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> two regiments of foot, and &s;ix troops of hor&s;e were rai&s;ed, under General Dalziel, a profligate &s;avage, educated in the military &s;ervice of Ru&s;&s;ia, in order to force the non-conformi&s;ts to hear the curates. The council emitted a proclama|tion, requiring ma&s;ters to an&s;wer for the conformity of their &s;ervants, and heritors for that of their te|nants, and give bond accordingly, under pain of horning.</P>
<P>Sir James Turner, though it is &s;aid, he &s;carcely acted up to his orders, had almo&s;t wholly ruined the &s;outh we&s;t of Scotland, and obliged multitudes to leave their hou&s;es, and wander among mo&s;&s;es and mountains. Four countrymen in Galloway, being informed that his mercile&s;s &s;oldiers had apprehended a poor old man, and were going to roa&s;t him naked upon a red hot gridiron, went, and begged them to let him alone: but, in&s;tead of hearkening to this hu|mane de&s;ire, the &s;oldiers fell upon the men, who, getting the better of them, di&s;armed them, and re|lieved their friend;&mdash;and fearing, that the other &s;ol|diers in the pari&s;h would fall upon them, they, and &s;even or eight more, &s;urprized the party, which all laid down their arms, except one that was killed. The countrymen about, apprehending, that Turner would cruelly re&s;ent what had been done, upon them, without lo&s;s of time, went to Dumfries and &s;urprized him, and di&s;armed his troops without hurting any
<PB N="268" REF="268">
of them but one that was wounded;&mdash;and then, at the cro&s;s, publicly drank the king's health, and pro&s;|perity to his government. Informed hereof, the council publi&s;hed a proclamation, which could not reach tho&s;e concerned till it was too late, requiring them to lay down their arms, and &s;urrender them|&s;elves to his maje&s;ty's lieutenant general, or &s;ome o|ther officers, within 24 hours, and prohibiting all per&s;ons to a&s;&s;i&s;t, harbour, or keep any corre&s;pon|dence with the&s;e rebels,&mdash;but containing no promi&s;e of indemnity in ca&s;e of &s;urrender. After &s;ome deli|beration, that per&s;ecuted handful formed them&s;elves into a &s;mall army, and re&s;olved to march towards E|dinburgh, in order to give their per&s;ecuted friends an opportunity to join them; and at Lanerk, being a|bout 1500, they renewed their &s;olemn covenant with God; and about the &s;ame time drew up a Manife&s;to no wi&s;e di&s;owning his maje&s;ty's authority, but bear|ing, that they had taken arms to defend them&s;elves and their per&s;ecuted brethren, in their adherence to their covenants, into which the king him&s;elf had &s;o|lemnly entered, and to protect them&s;elves and friends from &s;uch cruelty and violence, as they had for &s;ome time pa&s;t &s;uffered. As Dalziel, with Charles' troops, marched up towards them, they marched ea&s;tward by Bathgate till they came to Collington, about three miles from Edinburgh. Greatly dimini&s;hed by their fatigue, in marching &s;o far, in one of the la&s;t nights of November, and di&s;appointed of their expected a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from the Lothians, they, about 900, march|ed by the ea&s;t end of Pentland hills, where, while they were quite di&s;pirited and fatigued, and expect|ing a peaceful negotiation, Dalziel, contrary to his promi&s;e of a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, fell upon them, and killed 50 of them, and took as many pri&s;oners. But the country people in the neighbourhood killed and took pri&s;oners not a few more. Notwith&s;tanding Charles him&s;elf was &s;o a&s;hamed of the illegal cruel|ties proved again&s;t Sir James Turner, that he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him from his &s;ervice, yet the privy council, to
<PB N="269" REF="269">
whom, ju&s;t before their &s;kirmi&s;h at Pentland, the poor people had begged leave to repre&s;ent their grie|vances for two or three years, per&s;ecuted, murdered, impri&s;oned, forfeited, or bani&s;hed them that had ta|ken arms, or that gave them any harbour or lodging. And &s;uch as got an indemnity, had it, at the expence of wounding their con&s;cience, by &s;ub&s;cribing what they called the <HI>Bond of peace,</HI> in which they engaged for them&s;elves and the&s;e under them, to <HI>live peace|ably;</HI> that is, to bear no te&s;timony again&s;t the abo|minations e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</P>
<P>As the nobles were wearied of per&s;ecuting mini&s;ters and people merely for not hearing of curates, many of them &s;hamefully ignorant or profligate; and as it was expected, that it would divide and weaken the Pre&s;byterian party, Charles, moved by Tweedale, by a letter in 1669, granted an INDULGENCE to them, under certain conditions, which, through the oppo|&s;ition of the bi&s;hops and their clergy, had no &s;mall difficulty to obtain the approbation of the council. In con&s;equence of this, about forty-three Pre&s;byte|rian mini&s;ters were indulged either in their own pa|ri&s;hes when vacant, or in &s;ome other pari&s;h, as the council judged meet. Another indulgence was gran|ted to about eighty in 1672, to keep matters quiet, while Lewis of France and Charles his pen&s;ionary laboured to de&s;troy the Dutch nation, which kindly &s;heltered their per&s;ecuted Prote&s;tant brethren. Some few of the per&s;ons, to whom the&s;e indulgences were offered, refu&s;ed to accept them. Some of them that did accept, te&s;tified again&s;t the conditions, or betook them&s;elves to filly &s;hifts to quiet their con&s;cience, and cover their &s;hame; while a con&s;iderable number boldly pled for their own compliance, and raged at the field preachers, who te&s;tified again&s;t it. It was pled in favours of it, That magi&s;trates, for ends known to them&s;elves, may prohibit mini&s;ters to preach for a time, and afterward permit them to preach; that though magi&s;trates have not power to &s;ilence mini&s;ters altogether, yet they have power to

<P>On the other hand it was pled, that the procla|mation for the indulgence plainly flowed from the king's &s;upremacy over the church, and maintains his council's power to depo&s;e mini&s;ters from, and re&s;tore them to the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try, as they find proper; and that it was granted to &s;ome mini&s;ters to prevent others from preaching to any, but their own families: and that it was clogged with &s;everal &s;inful conditions, as, That they behoved to utter no|thing again&s;t <HI>Prelacy,</HI> or the king's <HI>&s;upremacy;</HI> that, unle&s;s they attend the bi&s;hops Synods and Pre&s;byte|ries, they mu&s;t confine them&s;elves to the pari&s;hes in which they preach; that they &s;hould admit none to &s;ealing ordinances, or to marriage, who belonged to any other e&s;tabli&s;hed, or indulged mini&s;ter, without his allowance; that they give no countenance to peo|ple of other congregations coming to hear them; that they all admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper on the &s;ame day; that they preach only in their own chur|ches, under pain of being held keepers of conventi|cles; that all matters of di&s;cipline, which formerly belonged to Pre&s;byteries, mu&s;t &s;till belong to the bi|&s;hops, Pre&s;bytery of the bounds, or next to it:&mdash;that therefore (1.) The <HI>acceptance of the indulgence</HI> reflect|ed di&s;honour upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only king and head of his church, as it practically declared, that the accepters did not hold their mini&s;try wholly and only of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that they hold the exerci&s;e of it from the magi&s;trate, either &s;olely or in conjuncti|on with Chri&s;t; that thus they receive the office or exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try from men, who, in this deed, neither do, nor can act in a &s;ubordination to Chri&s;t, as the head and fountain of all church pow|er; that thus they acknowledge all the rules and di|rections pre&s;cribed by them for ordering of the exer|ci&s;e of the mini&s;try, to be in&s;ufficient; and that not Chri&s;t alone, but magi&s;trates, have power to pre|&s;cribe the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for the exerci&s;e of

the mini&s;try; that not Chri&s;t alone, but magi&s;trates al&s;o, have power to pre&s;cribe, how he will have &s;uch an officer &s;et over &s;uch a particular flock; and that hereby they concur with limitations in, and about the di&s;pen&s;ation of Chri&s;t's &s;piritual ordinances, not pre&s;cribed by him&s;elf, nor by any mini&s;terial power &s;ubordinated to him, but in oppo&s;ition to him, both in matter and manner. (2.) It is contrary to Pre&s;by|terian principles; &s;uch as, that it belongeth to the church, and to church officers, to try and examine qualifications of &s;uch as are to exerci&s;e the mini&s;teri|al office, and, by explaining and applying Chri&s;t's rules, to declare who are fit and qualified for it; that it belongs to the church, or church judicatories, to convey mini&s;terial office and power to per&s;ons qualified, and to grant them a pote&s;tative mi&s;&s;ion, authorizing them to exerci&s;e their mini&s;terial functi|on; and to plant and tran&s;plant mini&s;ters to particu|lar charges, or loo&s;e their relation to them, as the good of the church requireth; that it belongs to church judicatories to give injunctions concerning the exerci&s;e of the mini&s;try and di&s;pen&s;ation of the ordinances of Chri&s;t; that the power of cen&s;uring, &s;u&s;pending, or depo&s;ing mini&s;ters, belongs to the church, not to a king or his council. (3.) It &s;up|ports and confirms the king's Era&s;tian &s;upremacy. The acceptance of it, made the &s;ub&s;equent act, of almo&s;t unlimited hard&s;hip over the church, nece&s;&s;a|ry to warrant the granting of it; and that <HI>act of &s;u|premacy</HI> alone makes the king's indulgence a legal deed, and &s;ecures the indulged from being held &s;edi|tious per&s;ons in the eye of the law. All the particu|lars included in the two preceding arguments, belong to the king's claimed head&s;hip over the church. The matter of the indulgence is the very matter of the &s;upremacy allotted him to &s;ettle, enact, and emit con&s;titutions, acts, and orders concerning matters, meetings, and per&s;ons eccle&s;ia&s;tical, according to his royal plea&s;ure. The acceptance of a benefit flowing from an u&s;urped power, manife&s;tly homologates that

u&s;urped power. (4.) It wrongs the people concern|ed in them, in practically giving up their former re|lation to their flock, and taking a new charge with|out any call from the people. (5.) While it plainly confirms and adopts the Era&s;tian principle of the de|pendence of the mini&s;try upon the magi&s;tracy, and the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of it on the magi&s;trate's will, it tends to the remarkable hurt of the church. Ma|gi&s;trates thru&s;ting out faithful mini&s;ters, and putting in whom they plea&s;ed in their room, did, under the Arian emperors, and even under king James, much hurt to the church. According to this method, magi&s;trates may quickly deprive us of faithful, or e|ven Prote&s;tant mini&s;ters, and plant naughty, errone|ous, or Popi&s;h prie&s;ts in their &s;tead: nay, by the In|dulgence, the mo&s;t part of non-conform mini&s;ters are &s;hut up in one corner by twos or threes, in a pa|ri&s;h, while the re&s;t of the land is given up to the will of Prelati&s;ts, Papi&s;ts, or Quakers. It is intended to re&s;train the&s;e field meetings at which multitudes of &s;ouls have already found &s;o much &s;piritual benefit. It tends to introduce the &s;ubjection of all mini&s;ters to the council in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. It encourageth others to enter into the mini&s;try upon ba&s;e conditions. It abandons the di&s;cipline of the church to the bi|&s;hops and their curates. It gives up with an ordina|tion of a faithful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of faithful mini&s;ters to the church. (6.) It gives up with all our own and our fathers &s;ufferings for our oppo&s;ition to Patronage or Era&s;tian encroachments of king or council on the power of Chri&s;t and his church, and for the &s;ole head&s;hip of Chri&s;t, or for Pre&s;byterian government. (7.) It &s;trengthens the hands of Prelati&s;ts, as hereby mini&s;ters impri&s;on them&s;elves in congregations, under their influence. It tempts them to &s;eek collation from bi&s;hops. It withdraws them from helping their faithful &s;uffering brethren, and leaves the curates in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t of the nation, and &s;ecures it to them in all time coming.

Many were the ex|orbitant fines impo&s;ed upon gentlemen, and others, in the &s;hires of Dumbarton, Lanerk, Air, Galloway, Dumfries, and Renfrew, for mere non-conformity to Prelacy, and non-attendance on the mini&s;trations of ignorant and pro&s;ligate curates. The&s;e of eleven gentlemen in the &s;hire of Renfrew, amounted to near 31,000 pounds &s;terling.&mdash;Finding, that notwith|&s;tanding, the field meetings more and more increa&s;|ed, the council in June 1674, emitted two proclama|tions, the fir&s;t of which requires heritors to become bound for their tenants, and tenants for their fami|lies, cottars, and &s;ervants, that they &s;hould not, under the pain of twenty-five pounds Scots for each tenant,&mdash;twelve pounds for each cottar,&mdash;and a fourth part of their year's fee for each &s;ervant, and the half for each wife or child, be pre&s;ent at any hou&s;e con|venticle, nor at any field conventicle, under the pe|nalty of the double.

with remarkable countenance from God, &s;eve|ral conform mini&s;ters attended them, and joined the &s;ufferers. The council finding, that they could not get all the attendants pro&s;ecuted, not a few of which were ladies and their children, they rai&s;ed new re|giments of &s;oldiers, and &s;tationed them in a con&s;i|derable number of garri&s;ons in the&s;e places where conventicles were mo&s;t commonly held, in order that they might deter from them or ru&s;h forth upon the people, while they were met for public wor&s;hip; and the country about was required to furni&s;h them with all things nece&s;&s;ary. In con&s;equence hereof, &s;ome of the &s;ufferers began to take arms with them to their meetings, in order to defend them&s;elves, if attacked. They al&s;o i&s;&s;ued forth letters of <HI>intercom|muning</HI> again&s;t about ninety or an hundred mini&s;ters, gentlemen, ladies, and others for preaching, or hear|ing at conventicles, or not appearing when &s;ummon|ed, to renounce their principles, or fall a &s;acrifice to their per&s;ecutors rage. The&s;e letters cut them off from all &s;ociety in the kingdom of Scotland; and it was declared, that who&s;oever &s;hould receive, har|bour, or conver&s;e with them by word or writ, or &s;upply them with meat, drink, clothes, or any o|ther nece&s;&s;aries of life, &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted with rigour as guilty with them of the &s;ame crimes; and all &s;herriffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were ordered to apprehend them wherever they could be found. This year the fines levied by the earl of Hume in Berwick &s;hire, amoun|ted to near 27,000 pounds Scots. Meanwhile, God remarkably countenanced &s;ome &s;acramental occa&s;i|ons among the &s;ufferers, e&s;pecially one in Elgin &s;hire, where the real Chri&s;tians were generally &s;o filled with the con&s;olations of Chri&s;t, that they &s;carcely knew, whether they were in the body or not; and not a few were delightfully converted to the Lord.</P>

The highland ho&s;t and regu|lar forces, to the number of 10,000, with &s;uch a train of artillery, as if they had intended to be&s;iege fortifi|ed cities, marched thither; but, notwith&s;tanding all their free quartering, plunder, and other oppre&s;&s;i|ons, the heritors, and &s;everal noblemen among them, refu&s;ed to give bond for the conformity of their fa|milies or tenants; nor could the people be got pro|voked to take arms in their own defence, which would have given the managers an handle to murder them, or by forfeiture deprive them of every thing belonging to them. After &s;ome weeks, the mana|gers being a&s;hamed of their horrid cruelties, and &s;hamele&s;s robberies, ordered the highlanders, all but 500, home. They carried along with them hor&s;es and goods to the utmo&s;t of their power. To mention particular plunders&punc; would be endle&s;s. From the three &s;mall di&s;tricts of Kyle, Carrick, and Cunning|ham, they de&s;troyed and carried off about the value of 140,000 pounds Scots. The council pu&s;hed on the &s;ub&s;cription of the bond above mentioned, though generally without the &s;ucce&s;s they wi&s;hed, notwith|&s;tanding they in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;uch as refu&s;ed, &s;hould give lawborrows, or &s;ecurity for their kind behaviour to his maje&s;ty.

field meetings, or force people to hear the profligate and per&s;ecuting curates, a Convention of E&s;tates was called in 1678, which impo&s;ed a ce&s;s of 360,000 pounds yearly, for the &s;pace of five years, in order to maintain a &s;tanding army for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of field conventicles. The payment of this ce&s;s, as the indulgence had done before, to the great joy of the bi&s;hops, occa&s;ioned warm contentions among the Pre&s;byterians. Some thinking it lawful to pay it, as a tax laid on by authority, even as Chri&s;t paid tri|bute to Ce&s;ar, and advi&s;ed others to do the &s;ame;&mdash; others thinking it unlawful, as an impo&s;ition of ty|rants, and plainly intended to promote wicked ends. After the council had ordered &s;ixty-&s;even of the im|pri&s;oned &s;ufferers to be tran&s;ported to Virginia as a kind of &s;laves, and whom providence relieved at Lon|don; and had levied more troops, and formed a new military oath for &s;ecuring the &s;oldiers full execution of the cruel work committed to them, and pro&s;ecuted many particular per&s;ons, and puni&s;hed them by fines, impri&s;onment, or the like, a few of the &s;ufferers, who had formed a re&s;olution to kill one Carmichael, who had, for a con&s;iderable time, mo&s;t furiou&s;ly per&s;e|cuted the non-conformi&s;ts in Fife, fining and impri|&s;oning multitudes, and torturing &s;ervants to make them di&s;cover their ma&s;ters or their property, and beating wives and children to make them inform a|gain&s;t their hu&s;bands and parents,&mdash;not to mention his rapes, adulteries, and like abominable wickedne&s;s. After they had in vain &s;earched for him, where they were informed he was to hunt that day, and were ju&s;t going to &s;eparate, they were unexpectedly infor|med, that archbi&s;hop Sharp was at Ceres in his way home to St. Andrews. They thought that God had delivered into their hand this perjured de&s;troyer of their church, arch-per&s;ecutor, and murderer of mul|titudes of their brethren, and who &s;ought their own life; and &s;o reckoning them&s;elves in an open &s;tate of war with him, re&s;olved to take away his life, which they did, not without &s;ome difficulty, about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mile

&s;outh we&s;t from St. Andrews. It is certain, he richly de&s;erved to die by the hands of public ju&s;tice in the mo&s;t &s;hameful and mi&s;erable form. But how far, in their circum&s;tantiated ca&s;e, it was lawful and pru|dent for the&s;e per&s;ons to take away his life, I leave to the judgment of God, who&s;e providence pre&s;erved all that had an active hand in it from the fury of their murderous per&s;ecutors, notwith&s;tanding all they could do to apprehend them. It neverthele&s;s gave the managers, who repre&s;ented his death as a kind of martyrdom, an handle for proceeding in, or in|crea&s;ing their cruelties, and for en&s;naring many with that que&s;tion, <HI>Whether the killing of him was murder or not?</HI></P>
<P>The council having emitted a proclamation prepared by Sharp, before his death, repre&s;en|ting field conventicles as tending to the ruin of the Chri&s;tian religion, the introduction of Popery and here&s;y, the &s;ubver&s;ion of monarchy, and the contempt of all laws and government; and appoint|ing all judges and officers of the army to proceed a|gain&s;t all that went to them with arms, as traitors, and to execute the laws again&s;t all other attendants on them,&mdash;The per&s;ecuted, who&s;e numbers daily in|crea&s;ed, therefore found, that their &s;afety was pro|moted by their attending in large multitudes. Pu&s;h|ed by Robert Hamilton, brother to the laird of Pre&s;|ton, and the lady of Earl&s;toun, a pious Chri&s;tian, but perhaps too ra&s;h and head&s;trong, a number of them agreed upon a &s;olemn te&s;timony again&s;t the a|po&s;tacy, wicked laws, and cruel per&s;ecution of the managers; and he, and about 80 armed men, pub|li&s;hed it at the cro&s;s of Rutherglen, on the anniver|&s;ary thank&s;giving for Charles' re&s;toration, May 29th, 1679, and burnt a copy of the wicked acts, again&s;t which they te&s;tified. This more and more provok|ed the fury of the managers. Graham of Claver|hou&s;e, afterward vi&s;count of Dundee, a mo&s;t cruel and bloody mon&s;ter, having an unlimited power to kill and de&s;troy all that he found in arms, &s;eized Mr.

King and about 14 others, who neither were in arms, nor had any thing laid to their charge; and driving them before him, bound two by two, attack|ed a field meeting near Drumclog the day after, be|ing Sabbath, but was defeated with the &s;laughter of 20, if not near 40, of his &s;oldiers. Claverhou&s;e e|&s;caping to Gla&s;gow, alarmed the troops that were there. Hamilton and his friends, flu&s;hed with their &s;ucce&s;s, and perhaps too dilatory in their pur&s;uit, en|tered into Gla&s;gow next day; but, after the lo&s;s of &s;ix or eight, were, by the firing upon them from the hou&s;es, obliged to retreat to Hamilton, where they formed a &s;ort of camp for their own defence.</P>
<P>The council, by proclamation, required all tho&s;e who had taken arms, to lay them down, and &s;urren|der them&s;elves to &s;ome officer of the army or magi&s;|trate, within the &s;pace of 24 hours, but promi&s;ed no indemnity;&mdash;and required all heritors and heads of families to permit none of their tenants, children, or &s;ervants to join them, under pain of being looked up|on as di&s;affected per&s;ons;&mdash;and farther required all the militia in the kingdom, to join and act with the regular forces, under &s;evere penalties; and all heri|tors and freeholders to attend the king's ho&s;t. Find|ing, that tho&s;e who had appeared in arms, had no|thing to expect but tortures and death, their friends ha&s;tened from all places around to defend them, if po&s;&s;ible, in &s;o much, that the king's troops, fearing an attack, retreated from Gla&s;gow to Edinburgh, and begged that a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be &s;ent them from England. To render him odious to the non-confor|mi&s;ts both in England and Scotland, Charles his fa|ther, appointed the duke of Monmouth to command the army; and the council in&s;i&s;ted, that the barba|rous Dalziel &s;hould be his lieutenant. Meanwhile, the divi&s;ions which took place among the &s;ufferers, who were once about 4000, but many of them poorly armed, relative to the making of the <HI>Indulgence</HI> a cau&s;e of fa&s;ting, and the owning of Charles' <HI>kingly authority,</HI> made many leave them, and di&s;pirited &s;uch

as remained, that few of them behaved with any cou|rage, and &s;o were ea&s;ily routed at Bothwel-bridge, 400 being killed, mo&s;tly in the pur&s;uit, and 1200 &s;urrendered pri&s;oners, who were &s;tripped almo&s;t na|ked, and obliged to ly flat on the ground for a con&s;i|derable time; and if any but rai&s;ed him&s;elf a little, he was &s;hot dead in an in&s;tant. Some of the officers propo&s;ed to burn Gla&s;gow, Hamilton, and all the country about Bothwel-bridge. But Monmouth re|jected their motion with indignation.&mdash;His compa&s;&s;i|on to the &s;ufferers i&s;&s;ued in his being quickly recalled, and Dalziel, who was as cruel as either managers or devils could have wi&s;hed him, made general of the forces in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>Dreadful was the ca&s;e of the pri&s;oners at Edin|burgh. Many of them were tried and executed: others were &s;hipped off for Virginia to be &s;laves, and after mo&s;t barbarous u&s;age, were mo&s;tly drowned in a &s;torm on the coa&s;t of Orkney, the Popi&s;h captain having ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to open the hatches, to give them an opportunity to e&s;cape, as him&s;elf and the &s;ailors did. Struck with horror at the cruelty, a &s;ailor ri&s;ked his life, and, by cutting through the deck, got about 50 of them out alive, while &s;ome hundreds were thus wilfully drowned in the hold. Not only they who had been in arms, in the affair of Bothwel, but &s;uch as had harboured or a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with meat or drink, or who had not attended the king's ho&s;t, according to the proclamation, were cruelly pro&s;ecuted, and their e&s;tates or property for|feited, and given to &s;uch per&s;ecutors as his maje&s;ty and the council thought fit. Some that were thought le&s;s guilty, were relea&s;ed upon &s;igning a Bond, in which they acknowledged the ri&s;ing at Bothwel-bridge <HI>rebellion,</HI> and engaged never more to take up arms without, or again&s;t his maje&s;ty, or his authori|ty, even in &s;elf-defence; but they were to have no benefit of the indemnity, if ever they &s;hould be found in arms at any field conventicle. Many choo&s;ed ra|ther to continue pri&s;oners, and hazard even life it|&s;elf,

than &s;ub&s;cribe &s;uch a bond. About the &s;ame time, indulged mini&s;ters were required to &s;ub&s;cribe a bond, in which they engaged them&s;elves to live <HI>peaceably,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> give no plain te&s;timony again&s;t the managers apo&s;tacy and per&s;ecution) and to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the privy council, when called, and to have &s;ureties, who &s;hould engage them&s;elves, their heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for their &s;o doing, under pain of paying 6000 marks Scots, if they did not pre&s;ent them to the council. The&s;e bands, mo&s;t of the mini&s;ters thought lawful in their pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances. But others, chiefly the author of the <HI>Ban|ders di&s;banded,</HI> &s;hews that it was &s;inful, &s;candalous, and inconvenient to comply with them.</P>
<P>An indemnity was publi&s;hed, but with &s;o many exceptions of mini&s;ters and heritors, who were con|cerned in the rebellion, or any way contributed to it, or who did not come to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king's ho&s;t, and loaded with the condition of engaging never to bear arms again&s;t the king or his authority, nor to be pre|&s;ent at field conventicles, that it was almo&s;t good for nothing. Meanwhile, Claverhou&s;e, with his dra|goons, terribly oppre&s;&s;ed the we&s;t country by free quarters, plunders, tortures, and murders. Cir|cuit courts were appointed rigorou&s;ly to puni&s;h all &s;uch as did not lay hold on the indemnity; and all, who had been concerned in the ri&s;ings of Pentland and Bothwel, and the murder of the archbi&s;hop, or had any way &s;upplied or corre&s;ponded with them.

Great numbers were condemned and executed, &s;ometimes merely becau&s;e they &s;crupled to acknowledge the &s;laughter of the archbi&s;hop to be <HI>murder,</HI> and the ri&s;ing at Bothwel <HI>rebellion,</HI> or would not take the <HI>bond</HI> pre&s;cribed by the council.</P>
<P>Next year, 1680, Charles and his council agreed to appoint the &s;oldiers to attack all tho&s;e that had been forfeited by the Parliament or criminal court, all mini&s;ters and heritors who had been in the rebel|lion, or heritors, who had contributed any thing to it; all rebels, who had not taken the <HI>Bond,</HI> or had been at field conventicles &s;ince the 27th of July la&s;t; all tho&s;e who had injured the Epi&s;copal clergy; all a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, e&s;pecially the murderers of the archbi&s;hop; and appointed the man&s;ion-hou&s;es, ca&s;tles, or towers &s;tanding on the forfeited e&s;tates, to be u&s;ed by the forces as garri&s;ons, from which they might be ready to &s;ally forth upon the above and like per&s;ons. A paper found upon Henry Hall, when he was appre|hended at Queensferry, and a declaration publi&s;hed at Sanquhar, in which all allegiance to K. Charles was renounced, and e&s;pecially the &s;olemn excommu|nication, and deliverance to Satan, of K. Charles, dukes of York, Monmouth, Lauderdale, and Rothes, Sir George M'Kenzie, the king's advocate, and Ge|neral Dalziel, on account of their re&s;pective horrible crimes, by Mr. Donald Cargil, at the Torwood, not only terribly infuriated the per&s;ecuting managers, but drew upon the &s;trict party loads of reproach from their indulged brethren. But it is certain, that, in all the&s;e ca&s;es, what was done, was upon <HI>ju&s;t cau&s;es.</HI> It is certain, the actors were in uncommon circum|&s;tances, when both church and &s;tate were really un|hinged by per&s;ecution, apo&s;tacy, and tyranny. How far then private per&s;ons, or one mini&s;ter might law|fully, or even prudently, do what pertained to the e&s;tates of the nation, or a church judicatory, is not &s;afe for us to judge, unle&s;s we were certain we had an equal mea&s;ure of the directing Spirit of God. It is

certain, the nations of England and Scotland, abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eight years after, practically approved the rejection of Charles' tyrannical authority; and that God, in his providence, appeared to approve that excommu|nication, in the mi&s;erable ends of tho&s;e that were laid under it, as Cargil had foretold.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, multitudes of gentlemen were forfeit|ed in their ab&s;ence, for their &s;uppo&s;ed acce&s;&s;ion to the ri&s;ing at Bothwel. The &s;oldiers killed or took pri&s;oners the outlaws wherever they could find them; and if a per&s;on was but ob&s;erved with a Bible or other good book in his hand, he was in danger of his life. &mdash;At Air's-mo&s;s in Kyle, Bruce, with about 120 dragoons, attacked about 40 &s;ufferers, and killed nine, among whom was Richard Cameron, a prea|cher, and his brother Michael, and took Hack&s;toun of Rathillet, and others pri&s;oners. After much tor|ture, Hack&s;toun was condemned, hanged with un|common cruelty, and, before he was dead, his heart was taken out by the hangman, and held up on the point of a knife on all the &s;ides of the &s;caffold, and then burnt; and after that, his head fixed on the Netherbow, with Mr. Cameron's and others, and one quarter of his body fixed up at St. Andrews, a 2d at Burnti&s;land, a 3d at Leith, and a 4th at Gla&s;|gow.&mdash;&mdash;Before now, the managers had &s;carcely &s;tuck at any thing fal&s;e, unju&s;t, ba&s;e, or barbarous. Notwith&s;tanding their marking of it in their regi&s;ter of council, Rothes, Lauderdale, and Halton his bro|ther, and archbi&s;hop Sharp, had perjuriou&s;ly depon|ed again&s;t James Mitchel, that they had never given him a promi&s;e of his life, upon condition of his can|didly acknowledging that he di&s;charged a pi&s;tol at archbi&s;hop Sharp, &s;everal years before his death.&mdash; When they could not find witne&s;&s;es, they tortured people to force them to confe&s;s what they plea&s;ed. They fal&s;ely marked the acknowledgments they made. If they could find nothing el&s;e, they required them to take &s;ome of their unhallowed <HI>oaths, bonds,</HI> or <HI>de|clarations,</HI> that either compliance might wound their

con&s;cience, and divide them from their fellow &s;uffe|rers, or their refu&s;al might be an handle for fining, impri&s;onment, bani&s;hment, forfeiture, confi&s;cation of goods, or the like. Their &s;ervants in the army acted up to their heart's content, in oppre&s;&s;ing the people, till the whole of Scotland &s;outhward of the river Tay was generally rendered ab&s;olutely mi&s;erable by plunder, oppre&s;&s;ion, and blood&s;hed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But when the duke of York, a zealous Papi&s;t, little bet|ter than bani&s;hed from England, came into Scotland, in 1681, he rendered the per&s;ecution hotter than ever. No le&s;s than twenty men and women were formally condemned and executed, of which Mr. Cargil was one, in this one year, for cleaving to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Parliament &s;itting down on the 28th of July, after a cold ratification of all former laws relative to religion, a&s;&s;erted, That the kings of this realm de|rive their royal power from God alone, and &s;ucceed lineally thereto, according to their known degrees of proximity of blood; and that none can attempt to alter or divert it, without involving the nation in perjury and rebellion, and expo&s;ing them to all the fatal and dreadful con&s;equences of a civil war. They next offered a new &s;upply to the king, in order to &s;upport his army in bearing down field conventicles, and doubled the fines for attending them: and bur|ge&s;&s;es, be&s;ides their former fines, were to lo&s;e their burge&s;s&s;hip, and be bani&s;hed from the town. This Parliament al&s;o formed a TEST for all that &s;hould be capable of any office in church or &s;tate, or of electing or being elected members of Parliament, and from which none but the king's <HI>lawful</HI> &s;ons and brothers were exempted; in which they &s;olemnly &s;wore, That they owned and profe&s;&s;ed the true Prote&s;tant religi|on contained in the old <HI>Scotch Confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> and believed it to be founded on the written word of God, and that they &s;hould adhere to it all the days of their life, and educate their children in it, and never con&s;ent to any alteration contrary to it;&mdash;and

renounced all Popi&s;h and fanatical principles contra|ry to, or incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;aid Prote&s;tant religion and Confe&s;&s;ion of faith;&mdash;and &s;wore and affirmed, That Charles II. is the ONLY &s;upreme governor of this realm, and in all cau&s;es <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> as well as ci|vil;&mdash;and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t and defend all rights, juri&s;dictions, prerogatives, privileges, preheminen|ces, and authorities belonging to him, his heirs and lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;ors;&mdash;and further affirmed and &s;wore, that they judged it unlawful for &s;ubjects, upon any pretence what&s;oever, to enter into covenants or leagues, or to convocate or a&s;&s;emble in any meeting, to con&s;ult or determine in any matter of &s;tate, civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, <HI>without his maje&s;ty's command, or ex|pre&s;s licence,</HI>&mdash;or to take up arms again&s;t him, or any commi&s;&s;ioned by him, and that they &s;hould never &s;o ri&s;e in arms, or enter into &s;uch covenants or a&s;&s;em|blies; and that there lieth no obligation upon them, from the national covenant, or &s;olemn league, or any other manner of way what&s;omever, to endeavour any alteration in the government either of church or &s;tate, as it is now e&s;tabli&s;hed by the laws of this kingdom; and that they &s;hall, to their utmo&s;t, de|fend, a&s;&s;i&s;t, and maintain his maje&s;ty's juri&s;diction fore&s;aid, again&s;t all deadly, and &s;hall never decline his maje&s;ty's power and juri&s;diction, as they &s;hall an|&s;wer to God.</P>
<P>This oath was a medley of Popery, Prelacy, E|ra&s;tiani&s;m, and &s;elf contradiction. After &s;wearing to the Prote&s;tant religion, the &s;ole head&s;hip of Chri&s;t over his church, and the duty of &s;ubjects to repre&s;s tyranny, and defend and &s;ave the lives of oppre&s;&s;ed innocents from tyrants, the national covenant, that great bulwark again&s;t Popery, is renounced, the ut|mo&s;t extent of the king's ab&s;olute &s;upremacy over both church and &s;tate &s;worn to, and the bringing in of a Popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or,&mdash;and all taking up arms in &s;elf defence, again&s;t the king or his officers, or doing a|ny thing for rendering the government of either church or &s;tate more perfect, is abjured. Many of

the curates them&s;elves exceedingly &s;crupled at it. But, by an act of council, which had no power to explain an oath impo&s;ed by Parliament, e&s;pecially one which the taker &s;wore that he took in the <HI>literal</HI> &s;en&s;e of the words, declaring, That the oath did not bind to every particular article of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> but only in &s;o far as it contained the doctrine, upon which the Prote&s;tant churches had &s;ettled the <HI>refor|mation,</HI>&mdash;and that the TEST did not cut off &s;uch rights as the primitive church enjoyed for 300 years after Chri&s;t,&mdash;and a&s;&s;uring, that the king never in|tended to change the government of the church,&mdash; all of them, except about eighty, &s;wallowed it, ra|ther than lo&s;e their &s;tipends, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to per&s;ecution. The conform mini&s;ters of Aberdeen, drew up &s;everal queries again&s;t it, importing, that they knew not how to &s;wear, that the &s;aid Confe&s;&s;ion is the true &s;tandard of the Prote&s;tant religion, which forbids re&s;i&s;tance of magi&s;trates, only while they pa&s;s not over the bounds of their office, and declares the <HI>bearing down of tyranny</HI> a good work, and yet abjure all re&s;i&s;tance of magi&s;trates on whatever pre|tence; or, to &s;wear that the king is the ONLY &s;u|preme governor over all per&s;ons, in all cau&s;es, when the &s;aid confe&s;&s;ion obliged them to believe, that Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is the <HI>only Head</HI> of the church; or, how to believe the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed government of the church, to be of divine and apo&s;tolical authority, and yet that the king had power to alter it at his plea|&s;ure; or to &s;wear to it, if it was &s;o indifferent, as that he might change it at his plea&s;ure; or, how to &s;wear, to defend all the king's privileges, and prerogatives, before they had con&s;idered and found them all con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>principles of religion;</HI> &mdash;or, how to abjure, as <HI>unlawful,</HI> all entering into covenants without the king's con&s;ent, when it was certainly lawful to enter into a covenant with Chri&s;t, or with one another, for ca&s;ting off the yoke of heatheni&s;m or Popery, even contrary to the command of earthly &s;overeigns;&mdash;or, to abjure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <HI>unlawful, all meetings</HI> of &s;ubjects to con&s;ult or de|termine

<P>The duke of Hamilton, the duche&s;s of Rothes, who&s;e hu&s;band had lately died under great honor, amid&s;t the prayers of her Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, Hopeton, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of rank, al&s;o de|clined taking this TEST. The duke of Queen&s;bery was allowed to take it, with an explication. The earl of Argyle, being, through the hatred of the duke of York, required to take it again and again, a month before the time pre&s;cribed by law, ventured to take it with this explication, <HI>as far as con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and with the Prote&s;tant religion and his loyalty to the king.</HI> For this he was immediately pro|&s;ecuted, as a depraver of the king's laws, and con|demned to death as a traitor. But he e&s;caped from pri&s;on, and fled to Holland,&mdash;while not a few others, who refu&s;ed this Te&s;t, were turned out from their civil offices, and the&s;e filled with &s;uch as York and his party thought &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to oppre&s;s and murder every true Prote&s;tant. The laird of Mel|drum, who had extorted about 100,000 pounds Scots from the &s;hire of Teviotdale, and who had lately got his oppre&s;&s;ive powers again&s;t the faithful noncon|formi&s;ts enlarged, was appointed &s;heriff depute in Ea&s;t Lothian. And while the council and ju&s;ticiary court, proceeded in their forfeiting, impri&s;oning bani&s;hing, or murdering work, Claverhou&s;e, Grier|&s;on of Lagg, and other officers of the army, held military courts in the &s;outh and we&s;t parts of the kingdom, to which they &s;ummoned all men and wo|men, above &s;ixteen years of age, and cau&s;ed them
<PB N="295" REF="295">
to &s;wear, &s;ometimes under very odd and dreadful imprecations, whether they had ever been at <HI>field meetings,</HI> or countenanced any who frequented them? and what they knew of their neighbours or others in the pari&s;h?</P>
<P>The indulged mini&s;ters having gone far in their &s;in|ful compliances with defection, and tho&s;e, that were not indulged, forborn to preach in the fields, but only in hou&s;es, becau&s;e of the fury of the managers again&s;t field meetings, the more zealous &s;ufferers had none, whom they could hear, without &s;cruple, after the death of Cameron and Cargil, they therefore re&s;ol|ved to unite them&s;elves more clo&s;ely by a general meeting, once every three months, of corre&s;pon|dents from their particular meetings, for prayer and &s;piritual conference. In the&s;e meetings, which con|tinued, from 1681, till after the Revolution, they agreed upon &s;uch te&s;timonies again&s;t defections, or &s;upplications for reformation, as they judged proper; they concerted &s;chemes for obtaining go&s;pel mini&s;ters whom they could hear with freedom, and for hav|ing Mr. James Renwick and other &s;tudents, taught and ordained in Holland, for their &s;ervice; they la|boured, by repre&s;entations, to vindicate them&s;elves to their friends in Holland, and other places, from the invidious reproaches ca&s;t upon them by the per|&s;ecutors, and by the indulged, and other lukewarm Pre&s;byterian brethren. Neverthele&s;s, it had per|haps been better, they had dealt le&s;s in &s;ome tickli&s;h debates. One of their fir&s;t productions was their declaration publi&s;hed at Lanerk, January 12th, 1682, in which they, in an an&s;werablene&s;s to the disjoin|ted and confu&s;ed condition of both church and &s;tate, profe&s;&s;ed to ca&s;t off the authority of Charles Stewart, becau&s;e, in his fir&s;t Parliament, he had unhinged that excellent con&s;titution of church and &s;tate, which their ance&s;tors had formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed; he had exalted him&s;elf into an unlimited &s;upremacy in all matters, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical; he had adjourned and di&s;&s;olved Parliaments at his plea&s;ure; he had
<PB N="296" REF="296">
fearfully oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted the godly for con|&s;cience &s;ake; he had heavily taxed his &s;ubjects, and dilapidated the revenues of the crown, for keeping up a <HI>brothel,</HI> rather than a court; and had in the late Parliament &s;ecured the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown to his Popi&s;h brother, formed the Te&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;And they burnt the TEST and <HI>act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</HI> This conduct, and e&s;pecially, as &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions of the declaration were very incautious, more and more enraged the managers, and the council appointed this and the <HI>declarations</HI> of Rutherglen and San|quhar, along with the &s;olemn league and covenant, to be publicly burnt by the hangman, at the cro&s;s of Edinburgh, with great &s;olemnity. The bailie, who delivered the covenant into the hand of the hangman for this purpo&s;e, &s;oon after had all his hou&s;es in the Parliament clo&s;e, which were reckoned the mo&s;t &s;tately in Europe, burnt to a&s;hes, by unaccountably kindled, and unquenchable flames, which did &s;carce hurt any other.&mdash;</P>
<P>Thence forward to the death of Charles in 1685, there was a con&s;tant &s;cene of the mo&s;t horrid op|pre&s;&s;ion, murder and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the &s;aints of God, and of all &s;uch as &s;hewed them any favour. While Meldrum, Claverhou&s;e, Grier&s;on, White, and other officers of the army, and others of like bloody di&s;po&s;itions, held their circuit courts, thro' a great part of the &s;outh, and e&s;pecially &s;outh we&s;t of Scotland, particularly in the &s;hire of Lanerk, where the declaration had been proclaimed, and had li&s;ts of &s;uch as belonged to <HI>the &s;ocieties,</HI> or who had &s;hewed them any favour, in &s;o much as permitting them to travel through their fields, and had not rai&s;ed the <HI>hue and cry</HI> again&s;t them, and laboured to rai&s;e the country again&s;t them, or of &s;uch as did not con&s;tantly attend their pari&s;h churches,&mdash;pre&s;ented to them by the clerks of the places, or curates of the pari&s;hes,&mdash;and fined, impri&s;oned, tortured, or killed them, as they plea&s;ed. Wives were pro&s;e|cuted, for holding any conver&s;e with, or giving any
<PB N="297" REF="297">
&s;upply to their outlawed hu&s;bands, or parents with their children. Such as appeared not, were for|feited or denounced <HI>rebels</HI> and <HI>outlaws,</HI> or intercom|muned in their ab&s;ence. Such as did appear, and di&s;proved that which had been laid to their charge, were never a whit better, unle&s;s they took the <HI>Te&s;t,</HI> which was appointed to be tendered to all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons as a trial of their loyalty. The council enac|ted, that it &s;hould be held <HI>trea&s;onable,</HI> for any to &s;ay, that they owned the king's authority <HI>according to the covenants.</HI> Nothing would plea&s;e them from the pro&s;ecuted &s;ufferers, but an owning of it without any limitation.</P>
<P>Mr. Renwick having got ordination, came from Holland in 1683, and preached in the fields. He was &s;peedily intercommuned, and they that attended his &s;ermons, furiou&s;ly &s;ought for, by every method, to their utter de&s;truction. While the &s;ea ports were &s;hut up, that they might not e&s;cape out of the king|dom, they were every where pur&s;ued by the merci|le&s;s &s;oldiers. Every neighbour was &s;worn to di&s;cover them, and bound up from giving them meat, drink, or lodging. Informers were hired to find out their lurking places, and what per&s;ons were inclined to &s;hew them any kindne&s;s. They were put from un|der the protection of the laws of their country. No terms were allowed them, but a renouncing of their principles, and by horrid oaths, involving them&s;elves in the mo&s;t dreadful perjury. The corre&s;pondent &s;ocieties therefore publi&s;hed an <HI>apologetical declarati|tion,</HI> in which they warned all &s;uch, as &s;hould here|after, by their commands, informations, apprehen|&s;ions, or murders, manife&s;t, that they maliciou&s;ly thir&s;ted for their blood, might lay their account, that they would avenge their conduct in proportion to the degree of it, to the uttermo&s;t of their power. By this they hoped to deter, at lea&s;t informers and country people, from hunting them out. But the council improved it, as an excitement to empower every &s;oldier in the kingdom, to kill directly in hou|&s;es

<P>CHARLES having been, it is &s;aid, poi&s;oned by his brother, and certainly got his mittimus into eternity in the Popi&s;h form, JAMES was &s;olemnly proclaimed king, and an oath of unlimited obedience, included in the proclamation, February 10th, 1685. But he was never &s;o complai&s;ant, as to take their <HI>co|ronation oath.</HI> Some impri&s;oned gentlemen, and a number of indulged mini&s;ters were relea&s;ed: but the per&s;ecution again&s;t <HI>field conventicles</HI> and &s;uch as fa|voured them, &s;till raged: many were murdered by Claverhou&s;e, Grier&s;on, Douglas, and other officers and &s;oldiers; and not a few in Elgin&s;hire &s;adly har|ra&s;&s;ed by the earls of Errol and Kintore, and major general Monro. The laird of Brody was fined in 20,000 marks, for having a conventicle in his hou&s;e, which was given in compliment to colonel Maxwel, a Papi&s;t. The laird of Grant was fined, becau&s;e his lady, who was in a bad &s;tate of health, had not at|tended her own church for &s;ome time, nor the neigh|bouring church, at &s;ix or &s;even miles di&s;tance, when her own was 18 months vacant. On March 2, the new king's indemnity was publi&s;hed, but it excepted &s;o many of the principal &s;ufferers, that it was of lit|tle value.

<P>The Parliament having &s;at down, April 28th, 1685, made a cold and &s;hort act for the &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tant religion.

<P>The earl of Argyle, in order to make a diver&s;ion in favours of the duke of Monmouth's attempt upon England, having landed with about 300 men in the we&s;t of Scotland, was quickly apprehended, and all his friends either apprehended or di&s;per&s;ed.

went upon too broad a bottom, they publi&s;h|ed a <HI>declaration,</HI> in which they di&s;owned the royal authority of James, on account of his being an ex|communicated Papi&s;t, and murderous idolater; and declared their dete&s;tation of <HI>Popery, Sectariani&s;m,</HI> and <HI>malignancy,</HI>&mdash;and their dete&s;tation of all <HI>murde|rous</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating</HI> principles, and all manner of <HI>robbing</HI> of open enemies or others, and all unwarran|table practices, &s;uch as the killing of the curate at Car&s;phearn,&mdash;which had been fal&s;ely charged upon them.</P>
<P>Toward the end of this year, James began to ex|empt his favourites, Papi&s;ts, or others from taking the <HI>Te&s;t,</HI> while he required it to be impo&s;ed on all others, as the Parliament had ordered. But the per&s;ecutions again&s;t the &s;upporters of <HI>field conventi|cles,</HI> and again&s;t the partizans of Argyle, were car|ried on with great vigour. John Ni&s;bet of Hardhill, and Edward Mar&s;hal were publicly executed. O|thers were more privately murdered, or died in pri|&s;ons, and others &s;courged or bani&s;hed for their non-conformity. Notwith&s;tanding Sarah Stewart atten|ded the curate her&s;elf, &s;he had her hou&s;e plundered. She was driven, with a &s;ucking child leaving other three babes behind her, to the pri&s;on of Wigtoun; and lay there eleven weeks, becau&s;e &s;he would not engage to di&s;cover her hu&s;band, and never to conver&s;e with him.&mdash;The &s;oldiers continued to plunder the poor non-conformi&s;ts in the cruelle&s;t manner.&mdash; Meanwhile, many who had been with Argyle, or favoured his cau&s;e, were obliged to hide them&s;elves in dens and caves of the earth, and others were for|ced to pay prodigious compo&s;itions for their fines. About eighty of them, mo&s;tly of the name of <HI>Camp|bel,</HI> were indicted, and &s;entenced to be executed, when apprehended.</P>
<P>In the three following years, 1686,&mdash;1688, the re|gi&s;ters of the privy council are wanting.&mdash;And to lull the nation a&s;leep, for the more peaceable introduc|tion of Popery, James and his agents abated their

per&s;ecuting rage. But the contentions between the per&s;ecuted them&s;elves, rather increa&s;ed. The mo&s;t fal&s;e and groundle&s;s reproaches were invented and &s;pread again&s;t Mr. Renwick and his friends. The&s;e had not a little alienated holy Mr. Peden from him; but Mr. Renwick's conference with him on his death bed, fully removed all his prejudices, and made him &s;orry that ever he had &s;o credited the&s;e mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions of him. One of the mini&s;ters, who came over with Argyle, provoked, that Mr. Renwick and his friends did not readily join that nobleman, accu&s;ed them of overturning Pre&s;byterian government, and &s;etting up a popular confu&s;ion in&s;tead of it,&mdash;com|mitting the trial and cen&s;ure of &s;candals to men, that were not church officers;&mdash;of thru&s;ting them&s;elves into the magi&s;trate's room, as a <HI>convention of E&s;tates,</HI> and managing both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs by the fame per&s;ons, and in the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly;&mdash;and of impo&s;ing unhappy re&s;trictions on mini&s;ters, in the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try, and requiring all to be di&s;|owned, who were not preci&s;ely of their judgment with re&s;pect to debated points. Alexander Gordon, John Dick, and Robert Cathcart, exceedingly mi&s;|repre&s;ented and reproached Mr. Renwick and his ad|herents, both in Scotland and Holland, as, contrary to our covenants, acting like Papi&s;ts, who believe their church infallible,&mdash;in declining to hear a mini|&s;ter, be he ever &s;o faithful, for the lea&s;t alledged per|&s;onal failing;&mdash;like Independents, taking upon them to depo&s;e mini&s;ters,&mdash;and differing little from the Separati&s;ts;&mdash;in &s;ending over a youth &s;carcely read in the common heads of divinity, to be ordained at Groningen in Holland, a mo&s;t corrupt church, and &s;etting him up, as Jeroboam did his idol calves, in|&s;tead of the faithful mini&s;ters of the church of Scot|land;&mdash;and in judging of faults, di&s;pen&s;ing cen&s;ures, and making eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws and acts, as if they, though laicks, were a General A&s;&s;embly. The&s;e o|dious calumnies obliged Mr. Renwick and his friends

to publi&s;h their <HI>Informatory vindication,</HI> from which, as well as from <HI>Renwick's life,</HI> and the <HI>Minutes of their general corre&s;pondence</HI> lately publi&s;hed, it is a|bundantly manife&s;t, that Mr. Renwick was a young man of uncommon piety, &s;olid judgment, and great candour, humility, meekne&s;s, and prudence, with whom none of his reproachers, for ought I know, were worthy to be compared; that, by the kind pro|vidence of God, and the pious conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Dutch mini&s;ters concerned, he got his in&s;truction and ordination in a cleanly manner; that, neither he nor his friends, ever thought every per&s;onal fail|ing of a mini&s;ter a cau&s;e of depo&s;ing him, or even &s;o much as of withdrawing from him in the mo&s;t bro|ken &s;tate of the church; that, in their corre&s;pondent meetings, they did not judge either of &s;candal or cen&s;ure of offenders, but of their own duty with re|&s;pect to them, Whether the &s;candal was &s;uch as to warrant their withdrawment from them; which pow|er the &s;cripture allowed them, Rom. vi. 17. 2 The&s;&s;. iii. 6, 14; that, though they had rejected the au|thority of the pre&s;ent magi&s;trates as tyrants, who had no authority from God, nor according to the good laws of the land, yet they had no more &s;et up them|&s;elves or meetings in their room, than tho&s;e who had declined the authority of the bi&s;hops, had thru&s;t them&s;elves into their epi&s;copal office; that they ne|ver intended to lay any re&s;trictions on mini&s;ters, but only de&s;ired, That they would declare the whole coun&s;el of God, and would freely preach up all duties, and down all &s;ins. Mr. Renwick and &s;ome of his friends, having afterward met with Robert Cathcart, attacked him on his <HI>defamatory information,</HI> which he had been &s;o careful to &s;pread far and near, he was obliged to excu&s;e him&s;elf, by &s;aying, That he had wrote of them, not as what they were, but what they would be. <HI>How villanous &s;uch conduct, and how &s;hameful for Wodrow to give him and his infor|mation &s;uch honourable place in his hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="305">While Mr. Renwick was thus abu&s;ed by wide &s;pread calumnies, and &s;ometimes by prote&s;tations a|gain&s;t his preaching at places, given in by fellow &s;uf|ferers, e&s;pecially apo&s;tates from the corre&s;pondent &s;ocieties, K. James laboured with all his might to have all the penal laws again&s;t Popery annulled, in order that it might be &s;peedily e&s;tabli&s;hed. Thus Arminian principles, unconcern about any thing &s;e|rious, and lu&s;t of court favour, and the promotions which they expected from it, made mo&s;t of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed clergy ready to comply with his intentions. He therefore &s;ummoned a Parliament to meet in A|pril 1686. Great care was taken to prepare the mem|bers for compliance with his will. But Whitford, &s;on to one of the former bi&s;hops, who had long be|fore turned Papi&s;t, and had been concerned in the ma|&s;&s;acre of the remains of the Walden&s;es in Piedmont, having, notwith&s;tanding all that the Popi&s;h prie&s;ts could do or &s;ay, died in great horror, a few days be|fore the Parliament, confe&s;&s;ing his execrable mur|ders, and crying out again&s;t Popery, as that <HI>bloody religion!</HI> Sir Robert Sibbald, a mo&s;t learned anti|quary and phy&s;ician, having been lately per&s;uaded by the earl of Perth to turn Papi&s;t, had &s;carce|ly done &s;o, when he was a&s;hamed of his conduct, retired to London, and, after &s;ome months re|tirement from company, and clo&s;e &s;tudy, became &s;o fully convinced of the errors of Popery, that he could not be ea&s;y, till he had come down to Edin|burgh, to make a <HI>public recantation</HI> in the church, a few weeks before the Parliament met. The&s;e events, &s;o circum&s;tantiated, awakened many, e&s;pecially of the laity, to their old zeal again&s;t Popery. Notwith|&s;tanding James' earne&s;t letter, and all that his agents could deal with members, by promi&s;es or threaten|ings, the Parliament refu&s;ed to repeal the penal laws. Some of the principal oppo&s;ers were therefore turned out of their places, which they held under the crown, and their places, e&s;pecially in the privy council, &s;up|plied with Papi&s;ts. At the &s;ame time, Popi&s;h books
<PB N="306" REF="306">
were indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed through the nation, while all printing or &s;elling of any thing contrary to his maje&s;ty's ab&s;olute di&s;pen&s;ing power, or to his Po|pi&s;h religion, was carefully repre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having got the council modelled to his mind, James continued his zeal again&s;t <HI>field conventicles.</HI> An 100 pounds &s;terling was offered to any that &s;hould bring in Mr. Renwick, either dead or alive, and &s;ome o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his friends were murdered in the fields. Some al&s;o of Argyle's a&s;&s;i&s;tants were condemned to death in their ab&s;ence.

The council having publi&s;hed this procla|mation with all &s;olemnity, returned him an an&s;wer approving it, and intimating their readine&s;s to pro|&s;ecute the ends of it, and thanking him for his <HI>royal word</HI> for maintaining the Prote&s;tant religion, as the be&s;t &s;ecurity they could have. Duke Hamilton and the earls of Panmure and Dundonald, having refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe this an&s;wer, were by him quickly turned out of the council. And the council was required to &s;uffer no Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter to preach without their allowance, nor until they had &s;worn the above mentioned oath to maintain his unlimited and irre&s;i&s;t|ible power. But quickly after, he allowed the Pre&s;|byterian mini&s;ters to preach during his plea&s;ure, and &s;o long as they behaved agreeably to his will, without taking this oath. Amid&s;t all this lenity, &s;ixteen men and five women were bani&s;hed to America, becau&s;e they would not own the pre&s;ent authority to be ac|cording to the word of God, nor condemn the <HI>San|quhar declaration,</HI> nor engage never to hear Mr. Renwick.</P>
<P>Finding, that his two former <HI>indulgences</HI> had little effect, James, in July 1687, cau&s;ed his council pro|claim a third, in which he declared his protection of the bi&s;hops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the free exerci&s;e of <HI>their</HI> Pro|te&s;tant

After this, the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters began to hold Pre&s;byteries and Synods, as their circum&s;tances permitted.&mdash;Mr. Renwick and his followers, who were as much expo&s;ed as ever, paid no regard to this toleration, but publi&s;hed a <HI>te&s;|timony</HI> again&s;t it, and were much offended with the&s;e Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters who had complied with, and &s;olemnly thanked James, on account of it. They looked on the <HI>Granter</HI> as one, with whom they could not communicate in any &s;uch tran&s;action, being by his principles bound to keep no faith with heretics, and having repeatedly &s;hewed his treachery and di&s;&s;i|mulation;&mdash;and as an apo&s;tate, bigotted, and ex|communicated Papi&s;t, and, as &s;uch, under the cur&s;e of Chri&s;t, as well as under the imprecations of his grandfather, who wi&s;hed the cur&s;e of God to fall up|on &s;uch of his po&s;terity as &s;hould, at any time, turn Papi&s;ts.

<PB N="309" REF="309">
but, by the laws of the land, incapable of govern|ment, having neither given, nor being capable to give the &s;ecurity required by the coronation oath. They looked on the toleration it&s;elf, as plainly pro|ceeding from his u&s;urpation of an ab&s;olute and unli|mited power, incon&s;i&s;tent with the law of God and liberties of mankind; that it implied in it a di&s;pen&s;a|tion of all the penal laws again&s;t Papi&s;ts, and its pro|per tendency was to introduce a lawle&s;s loyalty, e&s;ta|bli&s;h royal tyranny, and unite the hearts of Prote&s;|tants to Papi&s;ts as &s;afe neighbours. They ob&s;erved, that, by means of it, Papi&s;ts were encouraged, their numbers increa&s;ed, and the executive power lodged in their hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They con&s;idered it as di&s;honou|rable to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, to be merely tolerated under the notion of a crime, and the exerci&s;e of it clogged with unlawful re&s;trictions of &s;peaking nothing again&s;t Popery, Prelacy, or ab&s;olute power of kings. They looked on it, as extending not only to archbi|&s;hops and bi&s;hops, but to all Quakers and Papi&s;ts, and &s;o opening a door for all bla&s;phemy and idolatry. &mdash;They looked on the acceptance of it as a &s;candal, which could not but offend the generation of the righteous. They con&s;idered the <HI>addre&s;&s;es</HI> of thanks made on this occa&s;ion as a train of ful&s;om and bla&s;|phemous flatteries, to the di&s;honour of God, the re|proach of his cau&s;e, the betraying of the church, the hurt of the nation, and the expo&s;ing of the addre&s;|&s;ers to contempt. With re&s;pect to the mini&s;ters <HI>ad|dre&s;s</HI> above mentioned, they ob&s;erved, how contrary it was to Pre&s;byterian principles to congratulate an antichri&s;tian u&s;urper, for undermining religion and overturning laws and liberties;&mdash;to ju&s;tify the abro|gation of the national covenants, in giving thanks for a liberty, by which all the laws confirming them, or confirmed in them, are ca&s;&s;ed and di&s;abled;&mdash;to thank their king for opening a door for bringing in Popery, which, by their &s;olemn covenants with God, they were deeply engaged to extirpate. Thus, like the body of the Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters, Renwick and his
<PB N="310" REF="310">

<P>Soon after, Mr. Renwick, who had been marvel|lou&s;ly pre&s;erved, notwith&s;tanding about 15 or 20 de&s;perate &s;earches for him, was apprehended in the beginning of 1688. Notwith&s;tanding none had &s;po|ken before the council or ju&s;ticiary, with more bold|ne&s;s and freedom, yet &s;uch was the &s;en&s;e, meekne&s;s, and candour with which he an&s;wered their que&s;tions, and &s;pake in his own defence, that even his per&s;ecu|tors were affected, and behaved with uncommon mildne&s;s to him, who had for &s;everal years been the di&s;tingui&s;hed butt of their malice. He, like the Marquis of Argyle, Me&s;&s;rs. Guthry, Cargil, Kid, and King, and the other martyrs, had his &s;oul ra|vi&s;hed with the con&s;olations of Chri&s;t for &s;ome time before, and at his death. And after it, few, except &s;ome of the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters who had been <HI>indulged</HI> and <HI>thanked</HI> James for his toleration, and the Papi&s;ts, &s;poke of him without reverence or regard. Nay, the faithful &s;ufferers in general, at their public wor&s;hip, their &s;ociety meetings, and pri|vate and &s;ecret exerci&s;es of religion, had generally &s;uch gales of divine influence on their &s;ouls, as ba|lanced
<PB N="311" REF="311">
all their outward troubles. Even in this world, they received their hundred fold with per&s;e|cution. So good a ma&s;ter is Chri&s;t to his faithful &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts be&s;tirred them|&s;elves to their utmo&s;t, to fill the country with <HI>cate|chi&s;ms</HI> and <HI>manuals of devotion.</HI> James and his agents laboured to cramp the liberties of the Pre&s;byterians as much as they could, and to pro&s;ecute and turn them out of their preaching hou&s;es, on any frivolous pretence; and &s;till more eagerly pro&s;ecuted the fol|lowers of Renwick. James declared his di&s;&s;olution of all judicatories and magi&s;trates in royal burghs; and that he would maintain all his former proclama|tions; and threatened tho&s;e that would not comply with his mea&s;ures. To debar Mary and Anne, his two Prote&s;tant daughters, from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, a pregnancy, and at la&s;t a delivery of a &s;on by his queen, was publicly a&s;&s;erted, and &s;olemn thank&s;givings to God, on that account, appointed. But mo&s;t of the Prote&s;tants believed the whole to be an impo&s;ture, in&s;tead of the miraculous effect of a vow her maje&s;ty had made to the virgin Mary of Lo|retto.&mdash;Informed, that William prince of Orange, the hu&s;band of his daughter Mary, invited by many per&s;ons of rank, intended to invade Britain, and at lea&s;t procure the &s;ubjects &s;ecurity for their religion and liberties, he amu&s;ed the Engli&s;h with hopes of a Parliament, and pretended to a&s;k the advice of the bi&s;hops. But the privy council and bi&s;hops of Scot|land, being entirely at his devotion, offered him their lives and fortunes for his &s;ervice, and were de|&s;ired to impri&s;on all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons. They order|ed all the heritors to get ready their be&s;t hor&s;es and men, and to a&s;&s;emble them in particular places, that they might, as need happened, march to his maje&s;|ty's defence or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In the beginning of No|vember, the bi&s;hops tran&s;mitted a letter to James, admiring what marvellous deliverance and pro&s;perity he had met with,&mdash;thanking God for giving him a

&s;on and heir to his throne,&mdash;and thanking him&s;elf for the a&s;&s;urance he had given them of protecting their e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; and their deep concern to hear of an unnatural inva&s;ion from Holland; and their fervent prayers, that all concerned in it, might be covered with &s;hame. And, as the prince of O|range had &s;ent a declaration, repre&s;enting as the grounds of his expedition, how the laws of the king|dom had been arbitrarily overturned; how Papi&s;ts had been put into places of power and tru&s;t, and means u&s;ed for a &s;peedy introduction of Popery; how the rights and privileges of burghs had been ta|ken from them by mere arbitrary power, without any citation, trial, or &s;entence;&mdash;how evil coun&s;el|lors had &s;ubjected all admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice to an ab&s;olute and de&s;potic power, and had turned out, and put in judges as the &s;overeign plea&s;ed; and what an exorbitant power had been exerci&s;ed in impo&s;ing bonds and oaths;&mdash;in impri&s;oning gentlemen with|out any alledged trea&s;on;&mdash;in forcing many by tor|tures to accu&s;e them&s;elves;&mdash;in impo&s;ing arbitrary fines, frighting and harra&s;&s;ing many parts of the country with intercommuning and circuit courts, mak|ing &s;ome incur forfeiture of life or property for the mo&s;t general and harmle&s;s conver&s;e with their neare&s;t relations outlawed;&mdash;empowering officers and &s;oldi|ers barbarou&s;ly to de&s;troy, hang, &s;hoot, and drown the &s;ubjects, without any form of law, or any re&s;pect to age or &s;ex,&mdash;not giving &s;ome of them time to pray to God for mercy; and all this, for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they would not &s;atisfy them in &s;uch que&s;|tions as they propo&s;ed to them without any warrant of law, and again&s;t the common intere&s;t of mankind, which frees all men from being obliged to di&s;cover their &s;ecret thoughts,&mdash;be&s;ides a great many other vi|olences and oppre&s;&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;the council emitted a proclamation to prevent the &s;pread of it; but it made people the more fond of &s;eeing it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their deep poverty, the follow|ers of Mr. Renwick, who had Mr. Linning ordained

for them in Holland, as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, had, a little before, collected 240 pounds &s;terling, and therewith ran&s;omed a number of their brethren, that had been tran&s;ported to be &s;laves in Barbadoes. They had &s;carcely heard of William's landing in England, when they warned the we&s;tern curates, peaceably to leave their charges; and &s;ome who did not, were more &s;harply u&s;ed. They al&s;o laid out them&s;elves to de|&s;troy all monuments of Popi&s;h idolatry, not only in the we&s;t, but &s;ome of them in Edinburgh. They, but with too little unanimity, renewed the cove|nants, at Le&s;mahago. They u&s;ed what influence they could, to have proper per&s;ons elected to be re|pre&s;entatives in the convention of E&s;tates; and with no great unanimity rai&s;ed a number of men to guard it, and otherwi&s;e promote the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Wil|liam on the throne. Many of them were formed into their regiment under lord Angus, which &s;erved again&s;t Claverhou&s;e and his malignants; but while their junction with the e&s;tabli&s;hed forces di&s;plea&s;ed many of their friends, they were not over well u&s;ed by the managers of the &s;tate and officers of the army at the battle of Gillicranky, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e &s;ocieties pre|pared an ADDRESS to the Prince of Orange, in or|der to have their grievances redre&s;&s;ed; but, by rea|&s;on of their divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, and &s;ome incidents which retarded it, till it was too late, it was never pre&s;ented, as neither was their petition to the convention of E&s;tates. They drew up a petition to the Parliament 1690, in which they complained, That the redre&s;s of grievances had been &s;o long de|layed; that, though Prelacy had been aboli&s;hed, yet many wicked acts &s;upporting it, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Pre&s;byterian government, were not yet repealed, and many of the curates continued in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e churches, into which they had been intruded; that many acts of forfeitures &s;tood unrepealed; that many acts condemning our cove|nants and covenanted reformation, as rebellion, and impo&s;ing wicked oaths and bonds, &s;tood yet unrepea|led;
<PB N="314" REF="314">
that many, who had been active in the lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> per&s;ecuting times, and even murderers of their bre|thren, continued, or admitted to places of power and tru&s;t,&mdash;and craved, that the&s;e grievances may be re+dre&s;&s;ed; and that Pre&s;byterian government may be re&s;tored as it was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1649; that a full and free General A&s;&s;embly of Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters and elders, be called, with full power to order church af|fairs, cogno&s;ce public &s;candals, remove intruders from churches, and plant them with faithful mini|&s;ters; that patronage, the king's <HI>&s;upremacy</HI> over ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, and all <HI>indulgences</HI> proceeding from it, and the late <HI>toleration,</HI> proceeding from ab&s;olute power, be condemned, as contrary to law, and aboli|&s;hed; that &s;ome proper method be devi&s;ed for renew|ing of the covenants; and the admini&s;tration hereof left to the General A&s;&s;embly.

<P>Meanwhile, another <HI>addre&s;s</HI> was drawn up in name of many thou&s;ands, repre&s;enting to William, &s;till Prince of Orange, how the prevailing party, who had apo&s;tatized from their former reformation, had by laws, bonds, and oaths, excluded &s;uch as were able and faithful, from all places of power and tru&s;t, both in church and &s;tate; had inve&s;ted the king with an ab&s;olute &s;upremacy over both church and &s;tate, by which he might di&s;pen&s;e with all laws, and i&s;&s;ue forth what commands he plea&s;ed, to be obeyed without gain&s;aying; had enacted and executed many laws, per&s;ecuting men by fines, impri&s;onment, death, or the like, for their adherence to the true religion, and particularly for preaching and hearing the go&s;|pel; had annulled all the reforming Parliaments be|tween 1638, and 1650, and all their acts, tho' part of them had been ratified by the king; had terribly oppre&s;&s;ed the nation by enormous taxes, and by an|nexing to the crown, (or be&s;towing on favourites) the e&s;tates of &s;uch as they plea&s;ed to puni&s;h with

But the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters pre&s;ented a &s;hort one, in which, after congratulating his appearance for their relief, and apologizing for their compliance with the late toleration, they be&s;eech him to take effectual methods for delivering them from the yoke of Pre|lacy, which had been obtruded contrary to the will of the church, and to the genius of the nation,&mdash; and for re&s;toring Pre&s;byterial church government, and Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters that were &s;till alive, to their former charges.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="316">THE <HI>Convention of E&s;tates</HI> having met in April 1689, found that James, being a profe&s;&s;ed Papi&s;t, had a&s;&s;umed the royal power, and acted as king with|out ever taking the coronation oath required by law; and had&mdash;invaded the fundamental con&s;titutions of this kingdom, and altered it from a legal limited monarchy, to an ab&s;olute and de&s;potic power; and had exerci&s;ed the &s;ame to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Pro|te&s;tant religion, and the violation of the laws and li|berties of the nation; and inverted the ends of go|vernment, by which he had forfaulted the crown, &mdash;and the throne was become vacant!

They acknowledged William and Ma|ry king and queen of Scotland, and declared it high trea&s;on to di&s;own or impugn the &s;ame; appointed the new oath of allegiance to them, to be &s;worn by all in public tru&s;t; and re&s;cinded all preceding laws and acts of Parliament in &s;o far as they impo&s;ed any other oaths of allegiance, &s;upremacy, declarations, and te&s;t except the oath of fidelity in admini&s;tering particular offices.

That many, who had &s;worn the wicked oaths, and &s;undry ways per&s;ecuted the godly, were admitted to &s;ealing ordi|nances; and that many, who had habitually compli|ed with Prelacy, and borne office under it, and had taken the above mentioned oaths and bonds, were admitted to be ruling elders; and &s;ome who had been trained up to be curates, admitted to the mini&s;try, without any proper evidence of their repentance.&mdash; And though they did not plead, That every one of the&s;e offences, or every degree of any &s;hould be pro|ceeded again&s;t by di&s;ciplinary cen&s;ure; yet they pled, That as the Convention and Parliament had found Prelacy, &s;upremacy, and the like, contrary to the laws of the land, the A&s;&s;embly would find the&s;e, and the fruits thereof, contrary to the laws of Chri&s;t, and &s;tate them as cau&s;es of a &s;olemn general fa&s;t;&mdash;that proper methods be taken for renewing our covenants, in a manner accommodated to their circum&s;tances, &mdash;none being forced to &s;wear or &s;ub&s;cribe, or &s;o &s;o much as admitted, unle&s;s they appear to have a competent knowledge and &s;en&s;e of the &s;ins acknow|ledged, and duties engaged to therein; and that, in an&s;werablene&s;s to the allowance of Parliament, due care be taken to purge out all curates, that are either <HI>in&s;ufficient, negligent, erroneous,</HI> or <HI>&s;candalous,</HI>&mdash;as the continuance of &s;uch had done much hurt after 1638; &mdash;the people are peri&s;hing in ignorance and irreligion under their mini&s;try, and their continuance will ex|ceedingly ob&s;truct the planting of the Lord's vine|yard with faithful pa&s;tors.&mdash;This <HI>large paper</HI> was gi|ven into the committee of overtures, and read by them; but, in their report of the impropriety of reading it, it was carried by one vote in the A&s;&s;em|bly, that it &s;hould not be read there. The printed act of A&s;&s;embly &s;ays, that the committee of over|tures

But Mr. Linning, in his pre|face to Shields on <HI>Church communion,</HI> &s;trongly avers, that the&s;e words were not in the original minutes, but afterwards fraudulently foi&s;ted in by the clerk and the correctors of that act for the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>In their <HI>&s;hort paper,</HI> they do little more than inti|mate, That, after laying their <HI>larger paper</HI> at the feet of the A&s;&s;embly, to be di&s;po&s;ed of as they &s;hould judge proper, they declared their &s;ubjection of <HI>them|&s;elves</HI> and doctrine to the judicatories, and promi&s;ed to live in union and communion with, and &s;ubjecti|on and due obedience to the authority of this church. This the A&s;&s;embly accepted of, and received them into church fellow&s;hip with them. The &s;ocieties with which Me&s;&s;rs. Linning, Shields, and Boyd were connected, likewi&s;e gave into the committee of over|tures a pretty large repre&s;entation of their grievances, the &s;ub&s;tance of which was much the &s;ame as that of their preachers. It was ordered to be put into the hands of tho&s;e that were to draw up the <HI>Cau&s;es of the general fa&s;t,</HI> that they might make a proper u&s;e of it. Notwith&s;tanding they were not &s;atisfied, ma|ny, if not mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;ocieties, e&s;pecially where they had more godly and faithful mini&s;ters in their pari&s;hes, joined in the e&s;tabli&s;hment, giving in te&s;ti|monies again&s;t what they took to be wrong, to the mini&s;ters or &s;e&s;&s;ions, at their junction.</P>

<P>No part of their work required more candour and faithfulne&s;s, than their act for a general fa&s;t, and no where were they more deficient. They indeed a&s;|&s;ign as grounds of humiliation, that the nation had dealt treacherou&s;ly with God, and been un&s;tedfa&s;t in his covenant;&mdash;the intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t, and privileges of his church, had been &s;acrificed to the lu&s;ts of men; the king's &s;upremacy over the church advanced in &s;uch a way, and to &s;uch an height, as no Chri&s;tian church had ever acknowledged; the government of the church altered, and Prelacy, which hath been alway grievous to this nation, introduced, and many of the then &s;tanding mini&s;try of Scotland had &s;ud|denly and readily complied with it; many faithful mini&s;ters had thereupon been ca&s;t out, and in&s;uffici|ent and &s;candalous men intruded on their charges; and many families ruined, becau&s;e they would not own them as their pa&s;tors;&mdash;ungodly unlawful oaths and bonds had been impo&s;ed and taken, and many ruined and oppre&s;&s;ed for not taking them;&mdash;iniquity had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and unrighteous &s;tatutes had been made and executed; and many had been cruelly per&s;ecuted for their con&s;cience towards God; there had been too general fainting, mini&s;ters not giving &s;ea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary te&s;timony again&s;t the defections of the times; the abomination of the ma&s;s had been &s;et up in many places, and Popi&s;h &s;chools erected, and &s;everals fallen into idolatry;&mdash;dreadful impiety, profanene&s;s, athei&s;m, profanation of God's name by ignorant &s;wearing and breaking of oaths, ne|glect of God's wor&s;hip, profanation of the Sabbath, violence and &s;hedding of innocent blood, &s;hameful &s;en&s;uality, mutual divi&s;ions and heats, and reproa|ches among the friends of truth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had greatly
<PB N="325" REF="325">
abounded.&mdash;&mdash;It gave no &s;mall offence to many of the mo&s;t &s;erious, that in the&s;e cau&s;es of fa&s;ting, the mini&s;ters had &s;hewed &s;uch aver&s;ion to mention their own &s;ins, particularly re&s;pecting the <HI>indulgences</HI> and <HI>toleration</HI> above mentioned; that they had not more plainly repre&s;ented all the&s;e evils as highly aggravated, being at once contrary to the word of God, and to the &s;o often repeated covenants of the nation with him; that the &s;everal horrid abominations of the preceding period were not more particularly, and much more plainly and &s;trikingly mentioned.</P>
<P>King William had been bred up in Era&s;tian notions of magi&s;trates power over the church, and perhaps al&s;o in the political maxim, That no particular form of church government is <HI>founded</HI> in the word of God, but Pre&s;bytery, Prelacy, or Independency, become mo&s;t <HI>agreeable</HI> to it, as they be&s;t &s;uit the inclinations or circum&s;tances of nations concerned. The &s;enti|ments of mo&s;t of his courtiers were much the &s;ame. Many per&s;ons of rank were &s;o concerned about their own temporal deliverance, and getting back their for|feited e&s;tates, that they much overlooked the &s;piri|tual intere&s;ts of the church. Not a few of the mini|&s;ters wanted proper zeal, and others were loth to break with them. Wearied of their long and dread|ful per&s;ecution, which had murdered or rendered outwardly mi&s;erable about eighteen or twenty thou|&s;and in Scotland, and &s;ixty thou&s;and in England, the Pre&s;byterians were generally willing to take up with le&s;s than they wi&s;hed, rather than to provoke Willi|am and the great ones to frown upon them, and di&s;|turb their quiet. Hence the reformation which took place between 1638 and 1650, was wilfully overlook|ed, and the wicked acts of Charles' fir&s;t Parliament in &s;o far as they buried it, or the Parliaments which e&s;tabli&s;hed it, left unre&s;cinded. The Parliament laid a&s;ide a draught of an act, which but debarred &s;uch as had been active in the per&s;ecuting work from places of power and tru&s;t. As the &s;tate did not re&s;cind all the laws in favours of Era&s;tiani&s;m or again&s;t our cove|nants,
<PB N="326" REF="326">
the church did not &s;o plainly a&s;&s;ert the <HI>&s;ole head&s;hip</HI> of Chri&s;t over his church, and her <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> power to manage all her &s;piritual concerns indepen|dent of the magi&s;trate, nor the <HI>divine right</HI> of Pre&s;|byterian government, nor the <HI>perpetual obligation</HI> of our &s;olemn covenants, as the oppo&s;ition thereto in the preceding period called for: nor were either church or &s;tate much inclined to put their necks afre&s;h under this yoke of God.</P>
<P>No doubt, encouraged by his courtiers, K. Wil|liam laboured to render the Pre&s;byterians and their judicatories as dependent on the civil authority as he could. By keeping the curates in their churches, al|lowing them their &s;tipends, and even procuring for many, perhaps &s;ome hundreds of them, an ea&s;y ac|ce&s;s to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, he laboured to pro|mote his own carnal intere&s;ts. By two letters to their Commi&s;&s;ion, and another to the <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> 1692, he &s;trongly urged Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters to proceed fur|ther in a&s;&s;uming the&s;e Epi&s;copalian curates into a &s;hare of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church government. And, becau&s;e the A&s;&s;embly did not &s;eem &s;o forward in this matter as he wi&s;hed, the earl of Lothian his com|mi&s;&s;ioner di&s;&s;olved their meeting, without naming a|ny future diet. Mr. Crighton, their moderator, re|mon&s;trated again&s;t this di&s;&s;olution, and, in their name boldly declared, <HI>That tho office bearers in the hou&s;e of God have a &s;piritual</HI> INTRINSIC <HI>power from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the</HI> ONLY HEAD <HI>of his church, to meet in A&s;&s;emblies about the affairs thereof, the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;ame being repre&s;ented to the magi&s;trate;</HI> and craved, That the di&s;&s;olution of this A&s;&s;embly without indict|ing a new one to a certain day, might not be to the prejudice of our yearly General A&s;&s;emblies, granted us by the laws of the kingdom,&mdash;and named the 2d of Augu&s;t next year for the diet of their next meet|ing. To this remon&s;trance all the members declared their adherence. This free, faithful and open te&s;ti|mony for the <HI>&s;ole head&s;hip of Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>intrin&s;ic power of his church,</HI> much gladdened the hearts of
<PB N="327" REF="327">
the godly, who were grieved for the neutrality and indifference about the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, which then prevailed. But &s;ome mini&s;ters addicted to the court, clande&s;tinely apologized for this hone&s;t dealing to his maje&s;ty, as if it had been improper; nor did any of them hold their appointed meeting of A&s;&s;embly next year.</P>
<P>Not only did king William, five or &s;ix times, in his reign, adjourn the meeting of the General A&s;|&s;embly, and was too readily obeyed; but the Par|liament 1693, by their 6th act, appointed the new <HI>oath of allegiance,</HI> together with an <HI>a&s;&s;urance,</HI> &s;incere|ly acknowledging William and Mary the only lawful and undoubted &s;overeigns of this realm by <HI>right,</HI> as well as by <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> and faithfully engaging to main|tain their title and government, again&s;t the late K. James, and all his adherents, and all others,&mdash;to be taken not only by all noblemen, and all civil and mi|litary officers, but al&s;o by all mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, clerks of church judicatories, precentors, and voters in the election of mini&s;ters, under pain of their being deprived of their offices and &s;alaries, or bani&s;hed, or otherwi&s;e puni&s;hed as the privy council &s;hould judge proper. By their 23d act, <HI>for &s;ettling the quiet and peace of the church,</HI> after a &s;olemn and perpetual confirmation of act 5th, 1690, ratifying the Con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith and catechi&s;ms, Pre&s;byterian govern|ment, in all the heads, articles, and clau&s;es thereof, they further enacted, That none, who had not fir&s;t taken and &s;ub&s;cribed the <HI>oath of allegiance,</HI> and &s;ub|cribed the <HI>a&s;&s;urance,</HI> and al&s;o &s;ub&s;cribed the Confe&s;&s;i|on of faith <HI>as the confe&s;&s;ion of his faith,</HI> and acknow|ledged Pre&s;byterian government, as now &s;ettled, to be the only government of this church, and promi&s;|ed to &s;ubmit thereto, and concur therewith, and ne|ver endeavour directly or indirectly the prejudice or &s;ubver&s;ion thereof,&mdash;be admitted, or hereafter con|tinued, a mini&s;ter or preacher within this church; &mdash;and, that all the curates, who had not yet been a&s;&s;umed by the Pre&s;byterian courts, &s;hould, within
<PB N="328" REF="328">
thirty days, offer them&s;elves for admi&s;&s;ion on the above terms; that if they did &s;o, they &s;hould have their maje&s;ties protection, unle&s;s they &s;hould, with|in thirty days after their &s;aid application, be proved <HI>&s;candalous, erroneous, negligent,</HI> or <HI>in&s;ufficient:</HI> And further ordained, That the privy council, and all o|ther magi&s;trates, judges, and officers of ju&s;tice give all due a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in rendering the &s;entences of church judicatories effectual. By their 27th act, 1695, the Parliament again required all mini&s;ters, Pre&s;byterian and Epi&s;copalian, who had not taken the above men|tioned engagements to the government, to qualify them&s;elves without delay, under pain of deprivation from both <HI>office and benefice.</HI> The Parliament 1693's appointing of a monthly fa&s;t on account of the war with France, and other grounds, had been le&s;s di&s;|liked by many, had not one publicly declared end of that war been to cau&s;e Lewis XIV. of France make <HI>reparation to the holy See of Rome</HI> for what&s;oever he had acted again&s;t it, and make void all the infamous proceedings of the Parliament of Paris again&s;t the <HI>holy father Pope Innocent XI.</HI></P>
<P>The bulk of the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters did what they could to comply with his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, They pretended, That the <HI>oath of allegiance</HI> and the <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> were impo&s;ed on them as &s;ubjects, and not as a condition of, or qualification for their holding or exerci&s;ing their office. But the words of the act impo&s;ing them, and e&s;pecially the exclu&s;ion of Mr. James Hogg from &s;itting in the A&s;&s;embly 1695, by the king's commi&s;&s;ioner and advocate, on account of his want of that legal qualification, plainly manife&s;t|ed the contrary. The&s;e mini&s;ters not only frowned on, reproached, and harra&s;&s;ed Mr. Hogg, and others no le&s;s loyal than them&s;elves, becau&s;e they looked on the impo&s;ition of &s;aid oath and a&s;&s;urance, as a poli|tical &s;nare di&s;gracing their office, and making them liable, on every change of civil government, &s;olemn|ly to acknowledge the rights of the pre&s;ent gover|nors; and as an era&s;tian addition to the mini&s;terial
<PB N="329" REF="329">
qualifications pre&s;cribed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Several proce&s;&s;es were at once commenced again&s;t the emi|nently pious and u&s;eful Mr. John Hepburn of Orr, in Galloway, on account of his open and perhaps &s;ome|times imprudent te&s;timonies again&s;t the taking of that oath, and other defects of the revolution church, and his preaching and baptizing within the bounds of &s;ome of his laxer brethren. After &s;u&s;pending him from the exerci&s;e of his mini&s;try, they &s;tirred up the magi&s;trates to puni&s;h him with a long impri|&s;onment at Edinburgh. He, at length, &s;ubmitted, and was re&s;tored to the exerci&s;e of his office, but, returning to his reprehended conduct, he was depo|&s;ed in 1705, as one that ob&s;tinately continued in er|roneous opinions, and &s;chi&s;matical cour&s;es. In 1694, The A&s;&s;embly agreed on a FORMULA for the recep|tion of the curates, in which, an&s;werably to the command of the Parliament above-mentioned, they &s;hould declare their belief of the whole doctrines contained in the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> and engage con|&s;tantly to maintain them, and &s;hould acknowledge Pre&s;byterian government now &s;ettled by law, to be the only government of this church, (N. B. not the only government pre&s;cribed by Chri&s;t in his word) and engage to &s;ubmit to, and concur with it, and to ob&s;erve an uniformity of public wor&s;hip, as at pre|&s;ent performed, and allowed in this church.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Parliament made &s;undry good acts for confirming the laws in favours of the Con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith and Pre&s;byterian church government; &mdash;and for re&s;training bla&s;phemy, profanene&s;s, clan|de&s;tine and irregular marriages, &s;pread of Popery, and holding of weekly markets on Saturdays and Mondays, in towns;&mdash;and for &s;ettlement of &s;chools, and encouragement of preachers, particularly in the <HI>north,</HI> &amp;c;&mdash;and application of vacant &s;tipends to promote &s;uch purpo&s;es.&mdash;The A&s;&s;embly fixed the proportion of commi&s;&s;ioners to its meetings <HI>viz.</HI> two mini&s;ters and one ruling elder, from Pre&s;byteries of not above twelve mini&s;ters; three mini&s;ters and one

elder from Pre&s;byteries of not above eighteen mini|&s;ters; four mini&s;ters and two elders from Pre&s;byte|ries of not above twenty-four mini&s;ters, and &s;o pro|portionally in larger Presbyteries; and that none &s;hould be admitted members but mini&s;ters and ruling elders.

And, for preventing tran&s;portation, they, afterward, in their <HI>Large Overtures concerning di&s;cipline and government,</HI> declare the power of &s;up|plying vacancies to belong only to their own Pre&s;by|tery, and that no mini&s;ter of another Pre&s;bytery ought &s;o much as occa&s;ionally to preach in them, but with advice of the neighbouring mini&s;ters, and the <HI>harmonious</HI> con&s;ent of the elders;&mdash;and that Pre&s;|byteries &s;hould labour <HI>by all means to prevent tran&s;|portation</HI> of mini&s;ters who are already u&s;efully &s;ettled; as tran&s;portation is often a <HI>great grievance,</HI> and is <HI>&s;eldom</HI> to be practi&s;ed.

<P>Finding, that former appointments of mini&s;ters to preach or be &s;ettled in the <HI>North,</HI> had exceeding|ly failed, the A&s;&s;embly 1698, formed a number of overtures for the &s;upply of that poor, de&s;titute and ignorant country; and appointed <HI>twenty</HI> probatio|ners to go and preach in it. They appointed the a|bove mentioned <HI>Large overtures</HI> to be further con|&s;idered by Pre&s;byteries; and afterwards framed o|thers for the repre&s;&s;ion of profanene&s;s,&mdash;checking the &s;pread of Popery, and preventing marriage with|out proclamation of banns for three &s;everal &s;abbaths. Not a few &s;erious people, e&s;pecially in the &s;outh and we&s;t, &s;till &s;crupling to join the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, on account of her original defects and &s;uperadded blemi&s;hes, the commi&s;&s;ion publi&s;hed their <HI>&s;ea&s;onable admonition,</HI> in which they very plainly a&s;&s;erted, the <HI>&s;ole head&s;hip of Chri&s;t</HI> over his church, <HI>her intrin&s;ic power</HI> derived from him, and <HI>the divine right of Pre&s;|byterian church government,</HI> and laboured to &s;hew, that the church was in &s;uch a &s;tate of purity, that

&s;he may be &s;afely joined with, and could not, with|out &s;in and danger, be de&s;erted.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly 1699, chiefly occupied them&s;elves in forming <HI>acts</HI> and <HI>overtures</HI> again&s;t profanene&s;s and Popery, and for the &s;pread of Chri&s;tian knowledge in the North, and for that end, planting &s;chools and mini&s;ters there,&mdash;and for cau&s;ing all mini&s;ters, pro|bationers, and &s;chool-ma&s;ters, &s;ub&s;cribe the <HI>Confe&s;|&s;ion of faith.</HI> They al&s;o tran&s;mitted to Pre&s;byteries, &s;everal <HI>overtures</HI> concerning the revi&s;al of the regi&s;|ters of judicatories,&mdash;&s;chool-ma&s;ters diligence in teaching the principles of the Prote&s;tant religion,&mdash; and concerning witchcraft,&mdash;ob&s;tinacy in &s;candal,&mdash; Papi&s;ts renunciation of their delu&s;ions,&mdash;and concer|ning the making and ob&s;ervation of acts of A&s;&s;em|bly. The A&s;&s;embly, 1700, did little more than form the la&s;t mentioned <HI>overtures</HI> into acts, and make further provi&s;ion of mini&s;ters for the <HI>North.</HI> The A&s;&s;embly, 1701, moreover condemned an <HI>Apo|logy for M.

as frequent as they wi&s;hed. This A&s;&s;embly recom|mended the more frequent admini&s;tration of it, and that the number of mini&s;ters a&s;&s;i&s;ting at it, &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened. They revived the acts of 1645 and 1649, again&s;t Lykwakes, abu&s;es at penny-weddings, and promi&s;cuous dancings. They tran&s;mitted to Pre&s;|byteries &s;ome overtures concerning &s;candalous per|&s;ons turning Papi&s;ts, in order to e&s;cape di&s;cipline, &mdash;Prote&s;tants marrying Papi&s;ts,&mdash;intimations of ex|communication through the whole Pre&s;bytery, or in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy, through every kirk in the nation, &mdash;or irregular ab&s;olution from cen&s;ure by curates or others; and concerning the &s;trict trial of candidates for the mini&s;try,&mdash;and the calling of Pre&s;byteries to account for their diligence in the re&s;training of pro|fanene&s;s.</P>
<P>King William dying ju&s;t after the A&s;&s;embly, 1702, had conveened, they did nothing that needs to be here recorded. Queen Anne having &s;ucceeded him, &s;everal Synods dreading her unfriendly di&s;po&s;ition, thought proper to form acts expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erting <HI>Chri&s;t's &s;ole head&s;hip</HI> over his church, her <HI>intrin&s;ic power</HI> and the <HI>divine right of Pre&s;bytery:</HI> and &s;ome of the more zealous mini&s;ters thought to have pu&s;hed an act of that kind in the A&s;&s;embly, 1703. But to prevent it, the haughty earl of Seafield, her commi&s;&s;ioner, di&s;&s;olved their meeting, when they had done little more, than to form &s;ome directions for planting of mini&s;ters in the North,&mdash;and to draw up an addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty in favour of their Pre&s;byterian govern|ment, and repre&s;enting the extraordinary growth of Popery, the di&s;orderly behaviour of the curates, and the abounding of immorality and profanene&s;s;&mdash;and had given &s;ome recommendations, for &s;upplying and pre&s;erving the regi&s;ters belonging to the A&s;&s;emblies, and their committees and commi&s;&s;ions,&mdash;part of which had been de&s;troyed by the dreadful fire in 1701; and concerning the <HI>Large overtures</HI> of 1697. &mdash;Many prote&s;tations from all corners of the hou&s;e were offered again&s;t this di&s;&s;olution of their meeting,
<PB N="336" REF="336">
and or the <HI>intrin&s;ic power</HI> of the church. But Mr. Meldrum, the moderator, was &s;o overwhelmed with abu&s;e by the commi&s;&s;ioner, and with confu&s;ion, that he concluded with prayer, before any thing could be regularly marked. Ever &s;ince, I think, the General A&s;&s;emblies have been fir&s;t di&s;&s;olved by the moderator in the name of Chri&s;t, and then by the commi&s;&s;ioner in the name of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Probably to lull the Pre&s;byterians a&s;leep, one act was made by Anne's Parliament, in 1702, and ano|ther in 1703, ratifying all former laws in favour of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byterian church govern|ment,</HI> particularly the act 5th, 1690. Many had fearful apprehen&s;ions of a de&s;ign to have Prelacy <HI>tole|rated,</HI> if not e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Parliament 1703, but the Lord threw the members into &s;uch heats and con|fu&s;ions, as i&s;&s;ued in declaring it trea&s;onable to alter the government of the church. Neverthele&s;s, a trea|ty of an incorporating union with England was almo&s;t immediately after projected, and, notwith&s;tanding much oppo&s;ition, carried on and concluded. When it was laid before the Parliament in 1706, and the majority of members appeared to favour it, both mi|ni&s;ters and people were exceedingly concerned, and pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es again&s;t it. The Commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly &s;at during the whole &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and was uncommonly numerous. They fir&s;t pre&s;ented an <HI>addre&s;s</HI> for an unalterable e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of their religion, in the pre&s;ent and all &s;ucceed|ing generations, as far as human laws could go. To &s;atisfy them, the Parliament enacted, That the per|petual e&s;tabli&s;hment of the doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;ci|pline, and Pre&s;byterian government of this church, &s;hould be held as an unalterable, fundamental, and e&s;&s;ential condition of the intended <HI>union,</HI> if it &s;hould be concluded. Many thought, that this would be a better &s;ecurity for their religion, than any act of the Scotch Parliament alone. But the mo&s;t part of the true Pre&s;byterians &s;till continued aver&s;e to an <HI>in|corporating union,</HI> or coming under the juri&s;diction
<PB N="337" REF="337">
of a Briti&s;h Parliament, in which the Engli&s;h Prela|ti&s;ts would be ten to one of the Scots. Notwith|&s;tanding great oppo&s;ition from noblemen and gentle|men, who expected temporal advantages by promot|ing the union, the Commi&s;&s;ion pre&s;ented a <HI>&s;econd addre&s;s,</HI> in which they repre&s;ented the danger they would be in of oaths, te&s;ts, and impo&s;itions incon|&s;i&s;tent with their principles, and that it was contrary to their principles and covenants to approve of the civil power of bi&s;hops, to twenty &s;ix of whom the nation would be &s;ubjected in the Briti&s;h Parliament. To this they got no an&s;wer, but a clau&s;e in&s;erted in|to the act for &s;ecuring the church, bearing, <HI>That no oath, te&s;t, or &s;ub&s;cription, &s;hould ever be impo&s;ed within the bounds of this church and kingdom, contrary to our Pre&s;byterian e&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> but leaving Scotchmen liable to &s;uch impo&s;itions in any other part of the Briti&s;h dominions. The Parliament thereafter de|clared, that the Parliament of England might provide for the <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> of their church within that kingdom, as they &s;hould think expedient. By this, they, con|trary to the word of God, and our &s;olemn covenants with him, particularly the &s;olemn league, con&s;ented to the &s;ecuring of <HI>Prelacy</HI> and the <HI>ceremonies</HI> in Eng|land, as an e&s;&s;ential and fundamental condition of the union. The Commi&s;&s;ion being informed of this, notwith&s;tanding great oppo&s;ition, pre&s;ented a <HI>third addre&s;s,</HI> craving, That there might be no &s;uch &s;ti|pulation or con&s;ent to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>hie|rarchy</HI> and <HI>ceremonies</HI> in England, as they would not involve them&s;elves and the nation in guilt. But the expectation of 400,000 pounds &s;terling to balance the lo&s;s of Darien to the Spaniards, thro' the treachery of the Engli&s;h, and the hopes of worldly advantages from the court, or in point of trade, made mo&s;t of the Parliamenters overlook every thing religious,&mdash; &s;o that the perpetual e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> and the <HI>ceremonies,</HI> in England, as well as of <HI>Pre&s;byterian government</HI> and the <HI>&s;implicity of go&s;pel wor&s;hip</HI> attend|ing it, in Scotland, were both fixed as fundamental
<PB N="338" REF="338">
and unalterable conditions of the union; and each nation, by a &s;olemn deed of their Parliament, gua|rantied to the other, an e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion not a little contrary to their own.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their labour in pro&s;ecuting and depo&s;ing Mr. John M'Millan in 1703, who, be&s;ides declaim|ing again&s;t the defects and blemi&s;hes of the Revoluti|on church, denied the authority of the civil magi&s;|trates, becau&s;e of their not taking the covenants, and wanting other qualifications required in &s;cripture, and by the laws between 1638 and 1650,&mdash;and of Mr. John Hepburn in 1705, on account of his re|lap&s;ing into his former conduct,&mdash;the principal ap|pointments of the A&s;&s;embly in 1704, are, That mi|ni&s;ters &s;hould lecture a con&s;iderable portion of &s;crip|ture at a time; that none &s;hould be commi&s;&s;ioners to the A&s;&s;emblies, but &s;uch as have &s;ub&s;cribed the <HI>Con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> and have relation to, and re&s;ide in, the place from which they are &s;ent; that &s;candalous per|&s;ons, who turn Papi&s;ts to e&s;cape cen&s;ure, be excom|municated; that excommunications be intimated in the bounds of Pre&s;bytery, Synod, or through the whole kingdom, as may be&s;t corre&s;pond with the ob&s;tinacy of the &s;candalous per&s;on; that candidates for licence and ordination be very &s;trictly tried, and that Synods take care that it be &s;o; that Synods call Pre&s;byteries to account with re&s;pect to their diligence in the re&s;training of profanene&s;s, and cau&s;ing the acts made again&s;t it to be read from all their pulpits twice every year; that Synods and Pre&s;byteries care|fully ob&s;erve, that none be permitted to vent any Arminian, Arian, or Socinian errors; that &s;tudents, who under&s;tand the Iri&s;h language, be preferred to bur&s;aries in colleges, before any others; that Pre&s;by|teries earne&s;tly travel in collecting money from no|blemen and others, in order to rai&s;e a fund for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> and form|ing libraries there; that proper means be concerted for printing a new edition of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> or <HI>Gaclic bible,</HI> and for tran&s;lating the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith</HI> and <HI>larger

About this time, the <HI>Large Overtures</HI> were again publi&s;hed in a more correct &s;tate. They contained directions for the right con&s;titution of church JUDICATORIES in general, and re&s;pecting their moderators, clerks, re|gi&s;ters, proceedings, behaviour of members in them, and conclu&s;ion of their meetings,&mdash;and more particu|larly for the con&s;titution of KIRK SESSIONS,&mdash;electi|on and ordination of elders and deacons,&mdash;marriage, &mdash;admi&s;&s;ion of infants to bapti&s;m,&mdash;admi&s;&s;ion to, or debarring from the Lord's table,&mdash;procedure with drunkards, &s;wearers, profaners of the Lord's day, forni|cators, adulterers, and other unclean per&s;ons,&mdash;privy cen&s;ures:&mdash;for the con&s;titution of PRESBYTERIES, &mdash;licen&s;ing of preachers, planting of vacant congre|gations,&mdash;ordination, or tran&s;portation, of mini&s;ters, appeals and references from &s;e&s;&s;ions, cen&s;uring of gro&s;s &s;candals, from which &s;e&s;&s;ions do not ab&s;olve, &mdash;proce&s;&s;es in order to the greater excommunication, Pre&s;byterial exerci&s;es,&mdash;privy cen&s;ures:&mdash;for the con&s;titution and opening of Synods,&mdash;procedure of their committees,&mdash;procedure in procce&s;&s;es,&mdash;privy cen&s;ure of Pre&s;byteries,&mdash;and conclu&s;ion of their meetings:&mdash;and for the con&s;titution and opening of General ASSEMBLIES,&mdash;procedure of their &s;eve|ral committees,&mdash;procedure in their own work,&mdash;ap|pointment and procedure of Commi&s;&s;ions,&mdash;and con|cluding their meetings.&mdash;But the indolence of Pre&s;byteries, the re&s;toration of patronages, and the embarra&s;&s;ment of the A&s;&s;emblies with other bu&s;ine&s;s, hindered the e&s;tabli&s;hment of many of the&s;e excellent

directions, from being formed into &s;tanding rules. &mdash;Mo&s;t of the acts of the A&s;&s;emblies, 1705, and 1706, were little more than enforcements of preced|ing ones relative to profanene&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;and for cal|ling in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of magi&s;trates to prevent abu&s;es at <HI>penny weddings,</HI> and for recommending the lately compo&s;ed <HI>&s;cripture &s;ongs;</HI> for giving in of Overtures and References to the A&s;&s;emblies, and the exact re|gi&s;tering of the minutes of church courts; and for &s;trict admi&s;&s;ion to the Lord's &s;upper; parochial vi&s;i|tations,&mdash;and mini&s;terial vi&s;itation of families.&mdash;The mo&s;t important acts of the A&s;&s;embly 1707, are the&s;e largely directing how to prevent the increa&s;e of Po|pery, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a mo&s;t excellent <HI>Form of proce&s;s</HI> chiefly extracted from the Large Overtures.</P>
<P>While the perjury and other evils of the union &s;et|tlement more and more confirmed Me&s;&s;rs. Hepburn and M'Millan in their former cour&s;es, the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, in her A&s;&s;embly 1708, e&s;tabli&s;hed excellent rules for mini&s;ters vi&s;itation of families; they formed new acts for preventing the profanation of the Lord's day, and other impieties; they enjoined Pre&s;byteries to beware of ra&s;hly licen&s;ing or ordaining any candi|dates, who&s;e qualifications were doubtful; they re|commended their forming an Overture for prevent|ing <HI>competition of calls,</HI> or giving a <HI>&s;econd call</HI> to any candidate before his former one was finally di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; they empowered their Commi&s;&s;ion finally to examine and e&s;tabli&s;h the public u&s;e of the <HI>&s;cripture &s;ongs,</HI> which had, for &s;everal years, been under con&s;idera|tion. In 1709, they recommended the utmo&s;t reve|rence in the public wor&s;hip of God, and ordered a warning to that purpo&s;e to be read from every pul|pit; they earne&s;tly called all under their in&s;pection to concur in promoting the erection of a <HI>Society for propagating Chri&s;tian knowledge</HI> in the <HI>Highlands</HI> and <HI>foreign parts</HI> of the world, and required mini&s;ters and elders to collect what they could from their people, as a fund for &s;upporting this excellent de&s;ign: They re|commended to each Pre&s;bytery to form a library for

it&s;elf, out of the books &s;ent by friends from England, and &s;uch others as they could obtain. They, as had been repeatedly done before, required Pre&s;byte|ries carefully to examine the <HI>Large Overtures,</HI> that they might have them &s;peedily e&s;tabli&s;hed as a <HI>com|plete directory</HI> for their judicial procedure.&mdash;The A&s;|&s;embly 1710, formed &s;ome new overtures for pre|venting the licen&s;ing of too many, or unqualified, preachers. They required all general fa&s;ts appointed by either church or &s;tate, for ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary cau|&s;es, to be duly ob&s;erved. They appointed all mini|&s;ters in who&s;e bounds Bourignian errors are &s;pread|ing, to preach particularly and faithfully again&s;t them; and all Pre&s;byteries, in who&s;e bounds they are vented, carefully to cau&s;e all &s;choolma&s;ters, tea|chers, chaplains, and governors of youth to &s;ub&s;cribe the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith</HI> as the <HI>confe&s;&s;ion of their faith;</HI> and that no heritors or heads of families retain in &s;uch &s;tations any that refu&s;e their &s;ub&s;cription; that Pre&s;|byteries tran&s;mit to the Commi&s;&s;ion an exact and full account of the principal propagators of the&s;e er|rors, and the profe&s;&s;ors of divinity publi&s;h a full col|lection and nervous confutation of them. They for|med directions for di&s;po&s;ing of bur&s;aries in colleges to &s;tudents, e&s;pecially &s;uch as had the Iri&s;h language. In an&s;wer to a Repre&s;entation of the &s;ociety for pro|pagating Chri&s;tian knowledge, they appointed all tho&s;e who had not made the above recommended collections, to do it without further delay, and en|joined Synods to point out to the Society what places had mo&s;t need of &s;chools and catechi&s;ts. Almo&s;t every A&s;&s;embly for a con&s;iderable number of years, i&s;&s;ued recommendations for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that u&s;eful Society, with collections of money, or other|wi&s;e. The A&s;&s;embly 1711, recommended to Pre&s;by|teries to have the Lord's &s;upper &s;o admini&s;tered in their bounds, that people might have acce&s;s to it every mouth of the year. They earne&s;tly enjoined Pre&s;by|teries to labour, to their utmo&s;t, to have the wor|&s;hip of God &s;et up, and daily performed, in all the

parts of it, in every family in their bounds. They formed a new act for the cautious and careful proce|dure of Pre&s;byteries in trying, licen&s;ing, and ordain|ing candidates for the mini&s;try; and e&s;tabli&s;hed a FORMULA of que&s;tions and engagements for them at <HI>licence</HI> and <HI>ordination,</HI> in which they &s;olemnly declare, That they believe the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament to be the word of God, and only rule of faith and manners; that they &s;incerely own and be|lieve the WHOLE doctrine contained in the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> and will, to the utmo&s;t of their power, con|&s;tantly maintain the &s;ame, along with the purity of wor&s;hip pre&s;ently practi&s;ed in this church,&mdash;and di&s;|own all Popi&s;h, Arian, Socinian, Arminian, Bou|rignian, and other doctrines, tenets, or opinions what&s;oever, incon&s;i&s;tent with, or contrary to &s;aid <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith;</HI>&mdash;that they believe the Pre&s;byteri|an government and di&s;cipline of this church to be <HI>founded on the word of God,</HI> and will maintain, &s;up|port, and defend the &s;ame all the days of their life; &mdash;that they will meekly &s;ubmit them&s;elves to their re&s;pective judicatories, and maintain the unity and peace of the church, and follow no divi&s;ive cour&s;e from her e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and government;&mdash;that zeal for the honour of God, love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and de&s;ire of &s;aving &s;ouls, are their great motives and chief inducements to enter into the holy mini&s;try, and not any worldly de&s;igns or intere&s;t;&mdash;that they have u&s;ed <HI>no undue methods, either by them&s;elves or others,</HI> in procuring their call; that in the &s;trength of Chri&s;t they will live an holy and circum&s;pect life, and faithfully, diligently, and cheerfully di&s;charge all the parts of the mini&s;terial work to the edification of the body of Chri&s;t, parti|cularly of the people intru&s;ted to them.

from their profe&s;&s;ors, pari&s;hes, and Pre&s;byte|ries; and appointed their Commi&s;&s;ion to acquaint mini&s;ters in foreign parts what te&s;timonials they may &s;afely receive from candidates that offer them&s;elves to <HI>licence</HI> or <HI>ordination</HI> with them.

<P>During the preceding twenty two years, the Re|volution church had continued in much the &s;ame condition. The Lord had not a little countenancad her mini&s;trations, e&s;pecially by the more faithful, for the in&s;truction, conviction, conver&s;ion, and edifica|tion of &s;ouls, which had been left by the curates in a mo&s;t ignorant or profligate ca&s;e. The clergy had &s;omewhat rectified &s;everal defects of their original erection with re&s;pect to the a&s;&s;erting of <HI>Chri&s;t's &s;ole head&s;hip</HI> over the church, her <HI>intrin&s;ic power,</HI> and the <HI>divine right of Pre&s;byterian government.</HI> The moderator of the A&s;&s;embly 1692, with con&s;ent of the members, boldly remon&s;trated to the king's com|mi&s;&s;ioner, that the office bearers in the hou&s;e of God have a <HI>&s;piritual intrin&s;ic power</HI> from Je&s;us Chri&s;t the <HI>only head</HI> of his church, to meet in A&s;&s;emblies a|bout the affairs thereof. Many prote&s;tations of the &s;ame kind were made in the A&s;&s;embly 1703, when the queen's commi&s;&s;ioner di&s;&s;olved it. The A&s;&s;embly 1704, plainly told her maje&s;ty, that they were now again met in a national A&s;&s;embly in the <HI>name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;and approved &s;everal Synod books, which contained new acts a&s;&s;erting Chri&s;t's <HI>&s;ole head&s;hip</HI> over his church, her <HI>intrin&s;ic pewer,</HI> and the <HI>divine right of Pre&s;bytery.</HI> The A&s;&s;embly 1705,
<PB N="344" REF="344">
in their 5th act, expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ert the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be the <HI>alone king and head</HI> of his church. The A&s;&s;embly 1707, in their 11th act, expre&s;ly declare, <HI>That our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath in&s;tituted a government and governors eccle&s;ia&s;tical in his own hou&s;e, with pow|er to meet for the order and government thereof.</HI> At the conclu&s;ion of each A&s;&s;embly, the moderator, before the king's commi&s;&s;ioner, publicly declares, that as the A&s;&s;embly met in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only king and head of his church, &s;o they part in the &s;ame.&mdash;The Commi&s;&s;ion 1698, in their <HI>Sea&s;onable admonition,</HI> publicly declare, <HI>We do believe and own, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the</HI> ONLY HEAD <HI>and</HI> KING <HI>of his church; and that he hath in&s;tituted in his church officers and ordinances, order and govern|ment, and not left it to the will of men, magi&s;trate or church, to alter it at their plea&s;ure. And we believe this government is neither Prelatical, nor congregatio|nal, but Pre&s;byterian,</HI> which now, through the mer|cy of God, is e&s;tabli&s;hed among us; and believe <HI>we have a better foundation for this our government than the inclinations of the people, or laws of men.</HI> This &s;ea&s;onable <HI>Admonition</HI> was ratified and approved by the A&s;&s;embly 1699, act xii. By the above mention|ed FORMULA of 1711, every candidate licen&s;ed to preach, or ordained to the mini&s;try, is required &s;o|lemnly and publicly to avow, That the Pre&s;byterian government and di&s;cipline of this church are <HI>founded on the word of God.</HI>&mdash;All along to 1710, the A&s;&s;em|blies, in their cau&s;es of fa&s;ting or otherwi&s;e, more or le&s;s acknowledged the binding obligation of our pub|lic covenants. In act 5th, 1700, they lament our continued unfaithfulne&s;s to God, notwith&s;tanding our <HI>&s;olemn covenants</HI> and engagements to the contrary. In act 9th, 1701, they &s;ay, Our &s;ins are the more ag|gravated, that they are again&s;t &s;o <HI>&s;olemn</HI> and repeated <HI>vows,</HI> and <HI>engagements,</HI> and <HI>covenants</HI> with God, which have been openly violated and broken by per|&s;ons of all ranks, and treated with public contempt and indignities. To the&s;e two acts, they, for &s;eve|ral
<PB N="345" REF="345">
years after, refer in their cau&s;es of fa&s;ting. In act 7th, 1710, they &s;ay, The crying &s;ins both of for|mer and pre&s;ent times are highly aggravated by the violation of our <HI>&s;olemn covenants</HI> and engagements to the contrary.</P>
<P>But, by this time, the temporal advantages of our incorporating union with England began to be more and more overbalanced by the introduction of &s;inful corruptions from that country. The Sabbath began to be greatly profaned by driving of cattle, and other unnece&s;&s;ary labours. The &s;ocieties for reformation of manners gradually dwindled away. Our nobility and gentry, by little and little, gave up with family religion, and dropt the very form of godline&s;s. Spen|ding much of their time in England, they either contracted a liking to the hierarchy and &s;uper&s;tition there u&s;ed, or lived much in the neglect of public wor&s;hip; and being there under no mini&s;terial in|&s;pection, they and their families followed their own inclinations without controul.&mdash;Public oaths in qua|lifying men for civil offices, or in collecting of tax|es, were exceedingly multiplied, and much perjury thereby increa&s;ed. The <HI>abjuration oath,</HI> which had for &s;ome years been u&s;ed in England, was extended to tho&s;e in places of power and tru&s;t in Scotland, to be taken along with the <HI>oath of allegiance,</HI> and the <HI>a&s;&s;urance.</HI> The epi&s;copalian party introduced the Engli&s;h ceremonies, and &s;ervice, which their fathers had refu&s;ed. And notwith&s;tanding the A&s;&s;embly, 1707, made an act again&s;t it, and the commi&s;&s;ion u&s;ed &s;ome means to prevent it, they were but the more forward to &s;et it up, or extol it, and to rail at the go&s;pel &s;implicity of the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip. Nay the idolatrous wor&s;hip of the Papi&s;ts was openly prac|ti&s;ed and connived at&punc; A &s;uper&s;titious form of &s;wear|ing by <HI>laying the hand on</HI> and <HI>ki&s;&s;ing the go&s;pel</HI> was in|troduced into &s;ome of our civil courts. Such Scot&s;|men, as &s;erved the &s;overeign in England, or Ireland, were required to take the Lord's &s;upper in the Eng|li&s;h manner, as a te&s;t of their loyalty, and otherwi&s;e
<PB N="346" REF="346">
conform to the liturgy and ceremonies. An ob&s;er|vation of &s;uper&s;titious holy days was encouraged by the vacation of our civil courts in the end of the year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Addre&s;&s;es to the Hou&s;e of Peers were rejected, unle&s;s they were directed to the <HI>Lord's &s;pi|ritual,</HI> as well as temporal.&mdash;Strongly attached to their Popi&s;h pretender, many of the epi&s;copal clergy, of whom, in 1707, 165 &s;till retained their churches and &s;tipends, began to plead for a <HI>middle &s;tate</HI> of &s;ouls after death, and <HI>prayers</HI> for the <HI>dead;</HI>&mdash;the Lord's &s;upper being a <HI>propitiatory &s;acrifice</HI> for &s;in;&mdash;the <HI>mix|ing</HI> of the &s;acramental wine with water;&mdash;the nece&s;|&s;ity of <HI>ab&s;olution by a prie&s;t,</HI> and <HI>confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins to him</HI> in order to forgivene&s;s of them;&mdash;the <HI>anointing with oil</HI> in bapti&s;m and other ca&s;es;&mdash;the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of epi&s;copal ordination and bapti&s;m to &s;alvation;&mdash;the <HI>bowing</HI> towards the altar, and at the name of Je&s;us; &mdash;the reception of the <HI>meaning</HI> of the &s;criptures <HI>from the church</HI> or clergy; &mdash;and the rejection of the Athana&s;ian creed, concerning the Trinity, u&s;ed in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice,&mdash;and to recommend Popi&s;h books, containing <HI>devotions</HI> and <HI>prayers</HI> to the virgin Mary and other &s;aints.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, contrary to the mo&s;t &s;olemn &s;ecurity granted to the Pre&s;byterian e&s;tabli&s;hment in the Treaty of union, the Briti&s;h Parliament, 1712, gran|ted the epi&s;copalians an almo&s;t unbounded <HI>toleration,</HI> providing their clerk took the oaths to the govern|ment, and prayed for Queen Anne, who was now &s;trai|ning every nerve, to bring her Popi&s;h &s;uppo&s;ed bro|ther to the throne,&mdash;prohibiting magi&s;trates to oblige them to appear before any e&s;tabli&s;hed church judica|tory, and requiring them to protect them in their public wor&s;hip, &s;o long as they did not turn Papi&s;ts or bla&s;phemers. To protect &s;uch of them as &s;hould &s;cruple at the <HI>oath</HI> of <HI>abjuration,</HI> which &s;olemnly re|nounced their Popi&s;h pretender, and avowed the rightful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the elector of Hanover to the crown in his &s;tead, the Parliament, now managed by Jacobitical influence, impo&s;ed that oath upon every

Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter, under a very heavy penalty, if they &s;hould continue to officiate without taking it. By the impo&s;ition of this oath, <HI>ambiguous</HI> or <HI>danger|ous,</HI> in &s;everal of its expre&s;&s;ions, and expre&s;ly &s;aid in the Engli&s;h act, fir&s;t impo&s;ing it to be calculated for the <HI>perpetual maintenance of the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> and in which one had to &s;wear to maintain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h crown AS li|mited by two acts of the Engli&s;h Parliament, one of which expre&s;ly provided, That the &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould be of the <HI>communion of the church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>&s;wear to maintain her as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> the Pre&s;|byterian clergy would either, by their general refu|&s;al, give the court an handle to overturn their e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, or at lea&s;t be divided and weakened, and the refu&s;ers appear as di&s;loyal as any of the Jacobites, though their &s;cruples were very differently founded. And to provoke the Pre&s;byterians the more, the Parliament re&s;tored <HI>patronages</HI> in their whole extent, providing only, that patrons took the oaths to go|vernment, and did not profe&s;s them&s;elves Papi&s;ts. The Jacobites doctrine of unlimited obedience to &s;o|vereigns and their di&s;tinction of them by <HI>right</HI> and by <HI>actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> qualified multitudes of them in Scot|land, as well as in England, to &s;wear the <HI>oath of ab|juration,</HI> when <HI>impo&s;ed by authority,</HI> and now plainly enough impo&s;ed, as a mean of enthroning their Po|pi&s;h pretender.</P>
<P>The&s;e acts, &s;o ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ed, exceedingly alarmed the Scotch Pre&s;byterians. The <HI>Toleration</HI> enervated their di&s;cipline, and encouraged the Jacobites in their rudene&s;s and influence towards the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, and clergy, and opened a door for almo&s;t every error and abomination in the wor&s;hip of God. The <HI>re&s;toration of Patronage</HI> was calculated to &s;ill the church with Jacobiti&s;h or naughty clergymen by means of &s;olicitations or fimoniacal pactions, and &s;o occa&s;ion much perjury in their ordination vows, and render their mini&s;trations contemptible, u&s;ele&s;s, and hurtful.

The com|mi&s;&s;ion al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed her with re&s;pect to the <HI>abjurati|no oath,</HI> and, in a &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion of their loyalty, declared their &s;en&s;e of it,&mdash;which &s;he &s;aid was accep|table to her. Hereupon the A&s;&s;embly, in another <HI>addre&s;s,</HI> begged that &s;he would interpo&s;e her influ|ence for preventing the pro&s;ecution of &s;crupulous refu&s;ers of it. Me&s;&s;rs. Car&s;tairs, Blackwell, and Bai|lie, were &s;ent to London to pre&s;ent the&s;e <HI>addre&s;&s;es,</HI> and to agent their cau&s;e, but all to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>As the abjuration oath produced the mo&s;t di&s;agree|ble divi&s;ions, the A&s;&s;embles, 1712, 1713, 1714, and 1715, by expre&s;s acts, recommended and obte&s;ted all mini&s;ters to cultivate peace and harmony, not|with&s;tanding their different views or practices with re&s;pect to it. The other more remarkable acts of the&s;e A&s;&s;embles, were, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting and encouraging the <HI>Society for propagating Chri&s;tian knowledge;</HI> for regular admi&s;&s;ion of infants to bapti&s;m; for more frequent admini&s;tration of the Lord's &s;upper; for purging the &s;candals of &s;oldiers; for directing the vi&s;itors of Synod regi&s;ters; for regulating the licen|&s;ing
<PB N="349" REF="349">
of preachers, and di&s;couraging unworthy bur|&s;ars; and for execution of former acts to prevent the growth of Popery.&mdash;The commi&s;&s;ion, 1713, emitted a <HI>&s;ea&s;onable warning</HI> to be read from every pulpit, intreating people to beware of being deluded by the &s;ubtile pretences of the Jacobites, who really labour|ed to bring them under the yoke of a Popi&s;h preten|der; and the A&s;&s;embly, 1714, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty, repre&s;enting the alarming increa&s;e of Popery. About this time, the curates were become extremely in&s;olent and abu&s;ive, intruded them&s;elves into vacant congregations, and encouraged their fol|lowers to mob &s;uch as were appointed by their Pre&s;|byteries to preach in them. But mo&s;t of them join|ing in the rebellion, 1715, they were turned out of their kirks by the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>After the acce&s;&s;ion of K. George I. to the throne in 1714, the A&s;&s;embly, 1715, tran&s;mitted to him and the members of Parliament, a new repre&s;entati|on of their grievances, relative to the <HI>toleration,</HI> and <HI>abjuration oath, patronages,</HI>&mdash;and the <HI>&s;acramental te&s;t,</HI> impo&s;ed on Scotchmen, while &s;erving the &s;ove|reign in England and Ireland. He got his Parlia|ment, that year, to turn the AS of reduplication on the two Engli&s;h acts mentioned in that oath, into WHICH, and to declare that it was not intended to oblige his &s;ubjects in Scotland to any thing incon&s;i&s;t|ent with their legal e&s;tabli&s;hment of their religion. And as, notwith&s;tanding this, many &s;till &s;crupled at that oath, the Parliament, 1719, removed all men|tion of their Engli&s;h acts out of the form of it im|po&s;ed upon mini&s;ters and &s;chool-ma&s;ters. In con&s;e|quence of this, the mo&s;t of the mini&s;ters took it, and the few that did not, became di&s;liked by their bre|thren, but more e&s;teemed by many of the people. About the &s;ame time, the Parliament enacted, That all pre&s;entations given by patrons to candidates for vacant congregations &s;hould be of no effect, unle&s;s the pre&s;entee accepted or declared his willingne&s;s to accept, which it was, for a time, expected, few or
<PB N="350" REF="350">
none would. At lea&s;t the church had full power to prohibit candidates to accept pre&s;entations, until they had fir&s;t the call of the congregation.</P>
<P>The union &s;ettlement, and e&s;pecially mini&s;ters taking the oath of abjuration, having given new ground of offence to Me&s;&s;rs. John M'Millan, late mi|ni&s;ter of Balmaghie, John Taylor of Wamphray, John Hepburn of Orr, and James Gilchri&s;t of Dun|&s;core, as well as to Me&s;&s;rs. John M'Neil, and John Adam&s;on, preachers,&mdash;they went about inveighing again&s;t the &s;ame. On this account the A&s;&s;emblies 1715, 1716, 1717, and their inferior judicatories pro&s;ecuted them, with no &s;mall &s;everity. No le&s;s than about twenty-four acts and overtures were pa&s;|&s;ed again&s;t the&s;e pious, but &s;ometimes imprudent and mi&s;taking, friends of our covenanted reformation, eleven of which re&s;pected Mr. Hepburn, and nine Mr. M'Millan. Mr. Hepburn had been driven from his charge, and &s;uffered a long impri&s;onment, be&s;ide many other harra&s;&s;ments. Mr. M'Millan had been driven from his charge, and another thru&s;t into his place. Mr. Gilchri&s;t was depo&s;ed and laid under a &s;entence of excommunication, appointed to be inti|mated in all the pari&s;h churches in Scotland.&mdash;Mean|while the&s;e, and the two following A&s;&s;emblies, made acts for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Society for propagating Chri&s;|tian knowledge,</HI> and for the &s;peedy &s;ettlement of mi|ni&s;ters in the <HI>Highlands,</HI>&mdash;and again&s;t Popery and profanene&s;s;&mdash;and repeatedly enjoined Pre&s;byteries, without delay, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the <HI>Large over|tures</HI> above-mentioned, in order to their being e&s;ta|bli&s;hed as a <HI>complete directory</HI> for <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>govern|ment;</HI>&mdash;and prohibited prelatical curates or Pre&s;by|terian &s;eparati&s;ts, to exerci&s;e di&s;cipline on any mem|bers of this church. The A&s;&s;embly, 1718, i&s;&s;ued a recommendation, for providing a fund for &s;upporting the indigent widows and orphans of mini&s;ters. The A&s;&s;embly, 1719, enjoined every mini&s;ter to take care to have <HI>deacons</HI> as well as <HI>ruling elders,</HI> in his congregation. They i&s;&s;ued a &s;olemn warning again&s;t
<PB N="351" REF="351">
&s;muggling of goods, and perjuries at cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, in matters of trade, to be read in all the pari&s;hes of Scotland, and enjoined Synods, Pre&s;byteries, and &s;e&s;&s;ions, to execute the acts of A&s;&s;embly again&s;t abu|&s;es at penny-weddings, and to apply to the magi|&s;trates to execute the civil laws again&s;t &s;uch as are found guilty. They al&s;o framed an overture for re|gulating the &s;ettlement of vacant congregations, e&s;|pecially where the patrons delay for &s;ix months had put that matter in the hands of the Pre&s;bytery, in which elders, and e&s;pecially heritors, a majority of whom is required, are repre&s;ented as the proper <HI>elec|tors,</HI> though, e&s;pecially where there are no elders, heads of families, and per&s;ons of good reputation in the congregation, are to be regarded.</P>
<P>But the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e A&s;&s;emblies re|&s;pected the <HI>doctrine</HI> of the church. In 1714, there commenced a flagrant report, that Mr. John Sim|&s;on, profe&s;&s;or of divinity in the college of Gla&s;gow, had taught Arminian and other gro&s;s errors. Mr. James Web&s;ter, a mo&s;t pious and zealous mini|&s;ter of Edinburgh, finding by conver&s;e with him, that there was too much ground for this report, laid the matter before the General A&s;&s;embly.&mdash;They un|rea&s;onably burdened him with the pro&s;ecution of Mr. Sim&s;on before his own Pre&s;bytery of Gla&s;gow. &mdash;Notwith&s;tanding all his &s;ubtile &s;hifts and quib|blings, it was found evident, from his an&s;wers to his libel, and his letters to Mr. Rowan, That he had taught, That nothing is to be admitted in religion, but what is con&s;onant to rea&s;on;&mdash;that regard to our own happine&s;s in the enjoyment of God ought to be our chief motive in &s;erving him, and that our glori|fying of God is &s;ubordinate to it;&mdash;that the heathen may know by the light of nature, that God hath provided a remedy for &s;in, and if they would pray &s;incerely for the di&s;covery of the way of &s;alvation, he would grant it to them;&mdash;that if men would with diligence, &s;incerity, and faith, u&s;e the means for ob|taining &s;aving grace, God hath promi&s;ed to grant it

to them; and that the u&s;ing of the&s;e means, in this manner, is not above the reach of their natural pow|ers;&mdash;that there was no proper covenant made by God with Adam for him&s;elf and his po&s;terity; and that he was not our federal head;&mdash;that it is incon|&s;i&s;tent with God's ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s, to create &s;ouls wanting original righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that the &s;ouls of infants &s;ince the fall are created pure and ho|ly;&mdash;that it is probable, there are more of mankind &s;aved than damned; and it is more than probable, that baptized infants dying in infancy are all &s;aved; &mdash;that there is no &s;inning in hell after the la&s;t judg|ment; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which erroneous tenets were fully re|futed by Me&s;&s;rs. M'Laren and Flint, mini&s;ters of Edinburgh. But &s;uch was the power of his friends in the A&s;&s;embly, 1717, which concluded his proce&s;s, that in their 9th act, they only &s;ay, that he had gi|ven offence, and had vented &s;ome opinions <HI>not nece&s;|&s;ary</HI> to be taught in divinity, and that have given more occa&s;ion for &s;trife, than to the promoting of edification; that he had u&s;ed &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, that bear and are u&s;ed by adver&s;aries in an un&s;ound &s;en&s;e, though he di&s;owns that un&s;ound &s;en&s;e; and for an|&s;wering the objections of adver&s;aries, he had adopted &s;ome hypothe&s;es different from what are commonly u&s;ed among orthodox divines, and are not <HI>evidently</HI> founded on &s;cripture, and tend to attribute too much to natural rea&s;on and the power of corrupt nature, which undue advancement of rea&s;on and nature is always to the di&s;paragement of Revelation and effi|cacious free grace; and therefore prohibit him to u&s;e &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, or to teach, preach, or other|wi&s;e vent &s;uch opinions, propo&s;itions, or hypothe&s;es, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>But the A&s;&s;emblies were far from being equally kind to &s;uch as earne&s;tly endeavoured a clear illu&s;tra|tion of the doctrines of God's free grace reigning through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Airth</HI> having publi&s;hed a catechetical treati&s;e con|cerning the <HI>covenants of works and grace,</HI> and the &s;a|craments
<PB N="353" REF="353">
of <HI>bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper,</HI> in a more evangelical &s;train than &s;ome wi&s;hed, the A&s;&s;embly 1710, prohibited all mini&s;ters or members of this church to print or di&s;per&s;e in writ any catechi&s;m, without the allowance of the Pre&s;bytery of the bounds, or the Commi&s;&s;ion. The Pre&s;bytery of Aughterar|der having begun to require candidates for licence to acknowledge it <HI>un&s;ound to teach that men mu&s;t for&s;ake their &s;ins in order to come to Chri&s;t,</HI> the A&s;&s;embly 1717, on the &s;ame day they had dealt &s;o gently with profe&s;&s;or Sim&s;on, declared their abhorrence of that propo&s;ition as <HI>un&s;ound</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t dete&s;table,</HI>&mdash;as if men ought only to come to Chri&s;t the alone Saviour from &s;ins, after they have got rid of them by repentance. Mr. James Hogg one of the holie&s;t mini&s;ters in the kingdom, having publi&s;hed or recommended a cele|brated and edifying tract of the Cromwellian age, called the <HI>Marrow of modern divinity,</HI> the A&s;&s;embly 1720, fell upon it with great fury, as if it had been replete with Antinomian errors, though it is believed, many of the&s;e zealots never read it, at lea&s;t had never peru&s;ed it, in connection with the 2<HI>d part</HI> of it, which is wholly taken up in manife&s;ting the obligation, meaning and advantages of ob&s;erving the law of God. They condemned the offering of Chri&s;t as a Saviour to all men, or to &s;inners as &s;uch,&mdash;and the doctrine of believers full deliverance from under the law as a broken covenant of works. They a&s;&s;erted men's ho|line&s;s to be a federal or conditional mean of their obtaining eternal happine&s;s. They condemned the&s;e almo&s;t expre&s;s declarations of &s;cripture, That believers are not under the law; that they do not commit &s;in; that the Lord &s;ees no &s;in in them; and cannot be angry with them,&mdash;as <HI>Antinomian paradoxes,</HI> and con|demned the di&s;tinction of the moral law as a <HI>covenant of works,</HI> and as a <HI>binding rule of duty in the hand of Chri&s;t,</HI> in order to explain the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions. Me&s;&s;. James Hogg, Thomas Bo&s;ton, Ebenezer and Ralph Er&s;kines, Gabriel Wil&s;on, and &s;even others remon|&s;trated to the next A&s;&s;embly again&s;t the&s;e deci|&s;ions,
<PB N="354" REF="354">
as injurious to the doctrine of God's grace; and, in their an&s;wers to the Commi&s;&s;ion's <HI>twelve queries,</HI> they illu&s;trated the&s;e doctrines with no &s;mall clearne&s;s and evidence. Perhaps influenced by this, as well as by the wide &s;pread dete&s;tation of their acts, 1720, on that point, the A&s;&s;embly 1722, re-con&s;i|dered the &s;ame, and made an act <HI>explaining</HI> and <HI>con|firming</HI> them. This was le&s;s gro&s;s and erroneous. Neverthele&s;s, the twelve Repre&s;enters prote&s;ted a|gain&s;t it as injurious to truth; but this prote&s;t was not allowed to be marked. The moderator, by the A&s;&s;embly's appointment, rebuked them for their re|flections on the A&s;&s;embly 1720, in their Repre&s;enta|tion, and admoni&s;hed them to beware of the like in all time coming; again&s;t which they prote&s;ted. Mr. Wil&s;on having preached an excellent &s;ermon before the Synod of Mer&s;e and Teviotdale in 1721, in which he had freely hinted his di&s;like of the legal doctrines and other corruptions then prevalent, after two years harra&s;&s;ment before the Synod and Commi&s;&s;ion, he was at la&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the A&s;&s;embly 1723, with an admonition.</P>
<P>Little more of importance was done in the&s;e A&s;|&s;emblies, unle&s;s that about 4200 pounds &s;terling were collected for the per&s;ecuted Prote&s;tants of Lithuania, and four of their &s;tudents appointed to be &s;upported by bur&s;aries while attending the &s;tudy of divinity at the college of Edinburgh. Several acts were made for preventing the increa&s;e of Popery, and, in 1722, they repre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty the danger of his go|vernment by it. Other acts were made again&s;t pro|fanene&s;s, and for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the <HI>Society for propagating Chri&s;tian knowledge,</HI> and for planting proper mini&s;ters and teachers in the <HI>North.</HI>&mdash;They enacted, That none &s;hould be admitted to, or continued in, the office of elders or deacons, unle&s;s they were circum&s;pect in their walk, punctual in their attendance on ordinan|ces, and &s;trict in their ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day, and in regularly keeping up the wor&s;hip of God in their families; and that none &s;hould be &s;ent to, or

admitted members of the General A&s;&s;embly, unle&s;s they were atte&s;ted by the Pre&s;byteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as thus qualified.</P>
<P>Many of the clergy, perhaps fond of avoiding eve|ry appearance of good will towards the <HI>Marrow of modern divinity,</HI> &s;eemed now more legal and Baxterian in their doctrine than formerly. This induced mul|titudes of &s;erious Chri&s;tians, who had been formerly not a little di&s;gu&s;ted by their &s;wearing of the <HI>Abjura|tion oath,</HI> to leave them, and hear the Repre&s;enters and their friends, whom the late di&s;pute, and their harra&s;&s;ment attending it, had made to &s;earch and &s;ee further into go&s;pel truth. The&s;e, notwith&s;tanding their eminent exemplification and earne&s;t urging of go&s;pel holine&s;s, were exceedingly traduced by the prevailing party, as <HI>new &s;chemers,</HI> and <HI>Antinomian</HI> encouragers of a licentious life. They had probably been more abundantly reproached and harra&s;&s;ed, had not the managers got their hands full of other bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Mr. Hepburn, above mentioned, dying, his friends in Angus&s;hire almo&s;t per&s;uaded Mr. Francis Archibald, mini&s;ter of Guthry, into their &s;entiments. By this and &s;ome concurrent circum&s;tances, more than ordinary noi&s;e concerning the <HI>national covenant</HI> and <HI>&s;olemn league</HI> happened in that country. Rou&s;ed hereby, Mr. John Gla&s;s, a young popular preacher in it, &s;et him&s;elf to rail at the&s;e covenants, as unwar|rantable under the New Te&s;tament, and not obliga|tory, and even again&s;t &s;ome articles of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith.</HI> He further taught, That national churches are unwarrantable under the New Te&s;tament; that the kingdom of I&s;rael was of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical nature, and its officers church officers; that then church and &s;tate were the &s;ame; and both intirely typical; that the Old Te&s;tament church was an earthly king|dom; that all church covenants, that bring her into any connexion with the &s;tate, are legal and earthly, and means of introducing profane per&s;ons into her. By his addre&s;s he decoyed Mr. Archibald into his notions, to which they &s;oon added others, as, That
<PB N="356" REF="356">
Confe&s;&s;ions of faith ought not to be &s;ub&s;cribed; that only congregational churches are warranted under the Go&s;pel; that illiterate men are fit for preaching the go&s;pel; that Chri&s;tian congregations have power to ordain their own teachers; that all members have a &s;hare in governing the church; that Chri&s;tian ma|gi&s;trates have no more power about religious matters than other men, and ought not to employ their power for advancing religion, or for re&s;training or puni&s;hing heretics, or for giving more encourage|ment to good Chri&s;tians, than to other good &s;ubjects. Notwith&s;tanding all means for reclaiming them, they ob&s;tinately went about preaching their principles in fields and &s;treets, or printing pamphlets in favours of them. They were therefore &s;u&s;pended in 1728, and becau&s;e they contemned this cen&s;ure, they were, about two years after, depo&s;ed. But notwith&s;tanding their laying out them&s;elves, to their utmo&s;t, to erect Independent churches of a new form, in every cor|ner, where they could find any encouragement, the A&s;&s;embly 1739, reponed them to their office, tho' not to their charges.&mdash;On the other hand, it be|gan to be loudly reported, that profe&s;&s;or Sim&s;on had not only continued to di&s;regard the prohibition of the A&s;&s;embly, 1717, and teach his above mentioned er|rors,&mdash;but al&s;o had taught, That <HI>Je&s;us Ckri&s;t is not nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent;&mdash;that the per&s;ons in the godhead are not the very &s;ame in&s;ub&s;tance;&mdash;that nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tence, &s;upreme deity, and being the only true God, may be ta|ken in a &s;en&s;e importing the per&s;onal property of the Fa|ther, and &s;o not belonging to the Son or Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Both libels were fully proven again&s;t him; but the fir&s;t was left undi&s;cu&s;&s;ed. In con&s;equence of his de|claring his mind on the latter points in orthodox lan|guage, and after much quibbling and tergiver&s;ation, profe&s;&s;ing his &s;orrow for &s;ome of the offen&s;ive expre&s;|&s;ions proved again&s;t him, the A&s;&s;embly 1728, <HI>&s;u&s;|pended</HI> him from all exerci&s;e of any eccle&s;ia&s;tical power or function, till another A&s;&s;embly &s;hould think fit to re&s;tore him. And the A&s;&s;embly 1729, further de|clared,
<PB N="357" REF="357">
That it was not fit that he &s;hould be any further intru&s;ted with the training up of &s;tudents for the holy mini&s;try. This <HI>&s;light cen&s;ure</HI> of an ob&s;tinate Arminian, and an Arian bla&s;phemer, exceedingly grieved and offended multitudes of the more &s;erious.</P>
<P>Scarcely was this pro&s;ecution of profe&s;&s;or Sim&s;on fini&s;hed, when Mr. Campbel, profe&s;&s;or of church hi&s;tory in the college of St. Andrews, began, from the pre&s;s, to ridicule clo&s;e walking with God, and acknowledging him in all our ways, as enthu&s;ia&s;m, and to aver, That in the interval between Chri&s;t's death and re&s;urrection, his di&s;ciples looked on him as a cheat and impo&s;tor;&mdash;that &s;elf love is the chief motive and &s;tandard of all virtuous and religious acti|ons;&mdash;that the exi&s;tence of God and the immortality of the &s;oul cannot be known by the light of nature; &mdash;that notwith&s;tanding, the laws of nature are a cer|tain and &s;ufficient rule to direct rational minds to happine&s;s, and the ob&s;ervation of them is the great mean of our real and la&s;ting felicity. For the&s;e he was proce&s;&s;ed before the judicatories; but, by his artful colourings of his tenets, and pretences to ad|here to the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> as profe&s;&s;or Sim&s;on had always done, he not only e&s;caped cen&s;ure, but drew the A&s;&s;embly 1736, which fini&s;hed his proce&s;s, into an approbation of his doctrine concerning <HI>&s;elf love.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. William Wi&s;heart, late principal of the col|lege of Edinburgh, was &s;oon after &s;ound to have taught from the pre&s;s, That men are not altogether, if at all, vitiated with original &s;in; that the light of nature may, in &s;ome in&s;tances, be &s;ufficient to lead mankind to complete happine&s;s; that freedom of enquiry &s;hould never be re&s;trained by any <HI>Formula</HI> of doctrine, or <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith;</HI> that the minds of children &s;hould not be bia&s;&s;ed to the principles of a party, by learning catechi&s;ms by heart; that civil magi&s;trates have no power to puni&s;h here&s;ies of any kind, but their juri&s;diction reacheth only to tho&s;e crimes, that are committed again&s;t the &s;tate; and that all men ought to have full liberty to &s;peak and

write as they plea&s;e, provided their &s;entiments do not endanger the welfare of civil &s;ociety.&mdash;His pro|ce&s;s came before the A&s;&s;embly 1738; but his artful colouring of his errors, and his profe&s;&s;ion of adhe|rence to the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> brought him off, without any cen&s;ure; in con&s;equence of which, he &s;oon after, from the pre&s;s, recommended Dr. <HI>Which|cot's</HI> &s;ermons to the &s;tudents of divinity to form up|on,&mdash;without the &s;malle&s;t warning again&s;t the armi|nian and &s;ocinian errors therein contained, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>as to moral duties, we have the full concurrence of all heathen authors that are any whit reformed;</HI> (accord|ing to which, dependance on Chri&s;t, walking with God, or wor&s;hipping him in three per&s;ons, in and through Chri&s;t as mediator, and the like, are not mo|ral duties,)&mdash;that <HI>the great differences between men in the &s;everal ages of the world, have not been about any nece&s;&s;ary truth or any thing plainly declared in &s;cripture,</HI> (according to which, the doctrine of three di&s;tinct per&s;ons in the God-head,&mdash;the true and &s;upreme God-head of Chri&s;t,&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity, reality, and vi|carious nature of his &s;atisfaction for our &s;ins,&mdash;free ju&s;tification by his imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s,&mdash;regene|ration and &s;anctification by the almighty influence of his &s;pirit;&mdash;and of original &s;in imputed or inhe|rent,&mdash;mens natural inability to will or perform that which is naturally good, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;are all excluded from being nece&s;&s;ary truths, or clearly revealed in the &s;cripture,)&mdash;that <HI>no perfection of God's nature in|clines him to puni&s;h &s;in, but to be reconcileable to all that repent;</HI>&mdash;that <HI>that repentance, which is in the power of every man, is the term or condition of the new covenant, renders men objects of the divine compa&s;&s;ion, and removes the nece&s;&s;ity of divine puni&s;hment;</HI>&mdash;that <HI>to be accepted in and thro' Chri&s;t, or ju&s;tified thro' his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, is to be a&s;&s;ured, that God, thro' the perfection of his own nature, is reconcileable to &s;inners,</HI> and <HI>is ab&s;olutely re&s;olved and engaged to pardon their &s;in in and through Chri&s;t, to all who repent and believe;</HI> that <HI>religion is ju&s;t a moving according to rea&s;on;</HI> that <HI>if men u&s;e their natu|ral

<P>While the errors, that were creeping into the church, were &s;o tenderly handled, and the &s;preaders of them di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the bar of General A&s;&s;emblies on the ea&s;ie&s;t terms, they, who &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the growing defections, were not a little oppre&s;&s;ed. For about a dozen of years after patronages had been re&s;tored by the Parliament, no candidates had cou|rage to improve a pre&s;entation for their own intru&s;i|on on reclaiming congregations. At fir&s;t, one or two probationers began to accept pre&s;entations: but the outcry again&s;t them was &s;o great, that they &s;oon retracted and pa&s;&s;ed from them. But, Mr. Cham|bers, principal of the college of Aberdeen, having accepted a pre&s;entation to <HI>old Machir,</HI> probationers and others took courage, and followed his example; and though they, at fir&s;t, qualified their acceptances, with having the peoples con&s;ent, yet they would not retract, after the people had &s;hewed their aver|&s;ion. About 1729, and 1730, intru&s;ion of mini&s;ters upon the footing of pre&s;entations was become pretty common, and were warmly &s;upported by the A&s;|&s;emblies, and e&s;pecially by their commi&s;&s;ions. This rendered the attempts of &s;ome Pre&s;byteries and Sy|nods to re&s;train them ineffectual. The king, ha|ving the patronage of very many pari&s;hes in his hand, &s;uch mini&s;ters as expected favours from the court, promoted the intru&s;ions with all their might; and, in judicatories, and printed pamphlets, denied and railed again&s;t the right of the Chri&s;tian people to elect their own pa&s;tors; while Me&s;&s;rs. Currie, Hill, and others, laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h that right.</P>
<P>Finding, that they were like to be much troubled with remon&s;trances, di&s;&s;ents and prote&s;tations, in A&s;&s;emblies, Commi&s;&s;ions, and inferior judicatories, the A&s;&s;embly, 1730, refu&s;ed to record them, and to prevent any &s;tanding te&s;timonies again&s;t their refu|&s;ing
<PB N="360" REF="360">
to a&s;&s;ert the truth, in direct oppo&s;ition to pro|fe&s;&s;or Sim&s;on's errors and bla&s;phemies, and their vi|olent procedure in the intru&s;ion of mini&s;ters, they enacted, that no rea&s;ons of di&s;&s;ent or prote&s;t &s;hould be recorded in their minutes. Several remon&s;tran|ces and petitions were given in to the Synods of Mer&s;e and Lothian, as well as to the A&s;&s;embly 1731, but no way regarded. A remon&s;trance by forty-two mini&s;ters and three elders, and another by about 1600 Chri&s;tian people, many of them ruling elders, were pre&s;ented to the A&s;&s;embly 1732, in which they repre&s;ented the many abounding defections, which grieved their &s;pirit, as well as di&s;honoured God, and tended to the ruin of his church, and begged, that the A&s;&s;embly would addre&s;s his maje&s;ty and Parliament, for re&s;cinding their acts impo&s;ing the <HI>&s;acramental te&s;t</HI> on the members of this church;&mdash; e&s;tabli&s;hing the <HI>toleration,</HI>&mdash;re&s;toring <HI>patronages,</HI> and for laying a&s;ide the new form of &s;wearing on the go&s;|pels,&mdash;and for allowing the addre&s;&s;es of this church, though not directed to the <HI>&s;piritual Lords;</HI> that the A&s;&s;embly would exert them&s;elves to put a &s;top to the intru&s;ion of mini&s;ters on reclaiming congregations; would re&s;train commi&s;&s;ions from countenancing it, even where neither the Pre&s;bytery nor congregation, in the lea&s;t, concur in the call, trial, or ordination, of the candidate; that no appeals from Synods be judged by the commi&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s the members of that &s;ederunt, be &s;upernumerary to the&s;e of the Sy|nod, in mini&s;ters, as well as elders; that, if any of the actings of the commi&s;&s;ion be contrary to the con|&s;titutions and known principles of this church, they &s;hall be rever&s;ed, and them&s;elves cen&s;ured; that in|&s;tead of judicatories being condemned any more for te&s;tifying their di&s;plea&s;ure at candidates offen&s;ive ac|ceptance of pre&s;entations, none may be licen&s;ed or ordained, that favour that cour&s;e; that the 7th act of A&s;&s;embly 1730, prohibiting the recording of rea|&s;ons of di&s;&s;ent may be repealed; that, according to the injunction of &s;ome former A&s;&s;emblies, an act

But neither of the&s;e remon&s;trances were allowed &s;o much as a hearing. But, in con&s;equence of an overture of the preceding A&s;&s;embly, not a little wor&s;e than that of 1719, and contrary to the in&s;tructions of mo&s;t part of Pre&s;byteries that &s;ent any, they enacted, that <HI>Pro|te&s;tant heritors</HI> of any denomination or character, <HI>and elders, &s;hould be the only electors of go&s;pel mini&s;ters.</HI> This act was reckoned by multitudes an overturning of Chri&s;t's &s;piritual kingdom, and a robbing of his peo|ple of their &s;piritual rights, in his name, and under pretence of his authority. But the next A&s;&s;embly prohibited the Pre&s;bytery of Dunfermline, and by con&s;equence all others, to admini&s;ter &s;ealing ordi|nances to any, who&s;e con&s;cience hindered them to &s;ubmit to the mini&s;trations of an intruder violently impo&s;ed upon them.</P>
<P>Several mini&s;ters in &s;ermons, before Synods or Pre&s;byteries, as well as others, te&s;tified again&s;t this act of 1732, re&s;pecting the election of mini&s;ters. A|mong others, Mr. Ebenezer Er&s;kine, who&s;e evange|lical, clear, and maje&s;tic manner of preaching made him highly re&s;pected by the people, but di&s;liked by many of his brethren, in his &s;ermon, before the Sy|nod of Perth in October, 1732, te&s;tified again&s;t that act, and patronage, and &s;ome other prevalent cor|ruptions. After three days warm di&s;putation, the Synod appointed him to be rebuked at their bar for the matter and manner of the quarrelled parts of his &s;ermon. Twelve mini&s;ters and two elders di&s;|&s;ented. He appealed to the next A&s;&s;embly, but in|&s;tead of receiving any redre&s;s or protection, he was ordered to receive a rebuke.

violating his con&s;cience, he could not &s;ubmit to the A&s;&s;embly's &s;entence,&mdash;and that he &s;hould be at liberty to give like te&s;timonies again&s;t the act, 1732, or other defections, on any proper occa&s;ion. Me&s;|&s;ieurs William Wil&s;on of Perth, Alexander Moncrief of Abernethy, and James Fi&s;her of Kinclaven, for exoneration of their own con&s;ciences, al&s;o prote&s;ted again&s;t the &s;entence. Without allowing the&s;e four mini&s;ters to attempt any defence of their conduct, the A&s;&s;embly appointed their commi&s;&s;ion in Augu&s;t next, to proceed again&s;t them, by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or high|er cen&s;ure, if they did not retract their prote&s;t, and profe&s;s their &s;orrow for taking it. When the Com|mi&s;&s;ion met, the&s;e mini&s;ters were, with great diffi|culty, allowed to repre&s;ent their mind, and adhering to their prote&s;t, they were all &s;u&s;pended from the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try. The Commi&s;&s;ion, in No|vember, finding them &s;till impenitent, did, by their moderator's ca&s;ting vote, loo&s;e them from their rela|tion to their congregations. They prote&s;ted for the <HI>validity</HI> of their office and <HI>continued relation</HI> to their congregations, and declared a SECESSION, not from the con&s;titution of the church of Scotland, but from the <HI>prevailing party,</HI> in her judicatories, ay and until they &s;hould return to their duty,&mdash;becau&s;e (1.) They were breaking down her Pre&s;byterian con&s;titution of church government,&mdash;in trampling on and mak|ing deci&s;ions contrary to the order pre&s;cribed by her <HI>barrier laws,</HI> enacted in her pure&s;t times, for &s;ecur|ing due deliberation in forming &s;tanding laws and general rules,&mdash;in exerci&s;ing a lordly power over the con&s;ciences of Chri&s;t's people, empowering heritors and elders to impo&s;e on them whatever &s;piritual guides and pa&s;tors they plea&s;ed,&mdash;in promoting vio|lent intru&s;ions of mini&s;ters on reclaiming congrega|tions;&mdash;in cen&s;uring and ejecting mini&s;ters merely for their prote&s;ting again&s;t a &s;inful act of A&s;&s;embly; &mdash;in allowing the commi&s;&s;ions to u&s;urp the power of Pre&s;byteries in the &s;ettlement of pa&s;tors, if they re|fu&s;ed to carry on violent intru&s;ions, &mdash;and in threa|tening

the highe&s;t cen&s;ures to &s;uch as admini&s;tered the &s;eals of God's covenant to tho&s;e, who&s;e con&s;ci|ence hindered them from &s;ubmitting to the mini&s;try of intruders. (2.) They were pur&s;uing methods evi|dently tending to corrupt the doctrines contained in their own <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI>&mdash;in &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the proce&s;s again&s;t profe&s;&s;or Sim&s;on, and refu&s;ing judicially to <HI>a&s;&s;ert the truth</HI> in oppo&s;ition to his errors and bla&s;phemies,&mdash;in care&s;&s;ing Mr. Campbel while he &s;preads his erroneous tenets,&mdash;and in permitting or encouraging preachers to entertain their hearers with dry harangues of almo&s;t mere heathen morali|ty in&s;tead of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. (3.) They were impo&s;ing on mini&s;ters &s;inful terms of communion, and breach of ordination vows, in requiring them to forbear proper and zealous oppo&s;ition of the preva|lent cour&s;e of apo&s;tacy from the doctrine, wor&s;hip, government and di&s;cipline, of this church. (4.) They continued ob&s;tinate in their evil cour&s;es, not|with&s;tanding all ordinary means u&s;ed to reclaim them.</P>
<P>Deeply affected with this rent, the hone&s;t party in the church, exerted them&s;elves, to their utmo&s;t, in the choice of proper members for the next A&s;&s;em|bly, in order to have the leading grievances redre&s;|&s;ed, and the breach healed. The A&s;&s;embly 1734, not without great oppo&s;ition, laboured to give an effectual check to the prevalent cour&s;e of defection. They renewed and &s;trengthened the old acts of A&s;|&s;embly 1639, 1641, 1695, 1697, 1700, and 1705, which had been made to be <HI>barriers</HI> and fences of our con&s;titution again&s;t <HI>innovations.</HI> They re&s;cinded the 7th act of A&s;&s;embly 1630, which hindered mem|bers to te&s;tify again&s;t wrong deeds of judicatories, by recording their rea&s;ons of di&s;&s;ent, becau&s;e it was not made according to the&s;e <HI>barrier</HI> acts. And, up|on the &s;ame account, they repealed the 8th act of A&s;&s;embly 1732, above-mentioned, becau&s;e it gave too much countenance to violent &s;ettlements, and too much power to di&s;affected heritors, and was
<PB N="364" REF="364">
unfavourable to the liberties of the Chri&s;tian people. They rever&s;ed a violent &s;ettlement of Aughtermuch|ty, made by the commi&s;&s;ion again&s;t the will of the congregation and Pre&s;bytery, and thus declared the deeds of the commi&s;&s;ion rever&s;ible. They had pro|bably ca&s;t out &s;ome other intruders, if complaints had been regularly tabled before them. They laid commi&s;&s;ions under &s;ome new regulations, and prohi|bited them to execute any &s;ettlements, when the Pre&s;bytery or Synod of the bounds declined it. They empowered the Synod of <HI>Perth</HI> and <HI>Stirling</HI> to re|&s;tore the four ejected mini&s;ters to their charges, without requiring any acknowledgments from them, &mdash;which was &s;oon after done. They, by an act, de|clared, that due and regular mini&s;terial freedom was &s;till left intire, notwith&s;tanding the acts of 1733 a|gain&s;t them. They appointed a committee to form an overture for the right preaching of the go&s;pel, and for re&s;training the new fa&s;hioned, legal, and heatheni&s;h harangues. They enjoined their com|mi&s;&s;ion to appoint a <HI>national fa&s;t,</HI> which had been for many years neglected, that all ranks might mourn for the prevailing defections of the church and land, which they quickly did, but many of the court par|ty neglected to ob&s;erve it. They al&s;o empowered their commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>addre&s;s</HI> the king and Parliament for relief from patronages, which they did, but in vain. The A&s;&s;embly 1735, appointed the Synod of Fife to grant &s;ealing ordinances to the people of Kin|ro&s;s, as they &s;hall find for mo&s;t edification;&mdash;and letters were &s;ent to &s;ome Pre&s;byteries allowing them to treat others who had been oppre&s;&s;ed by violent &s;et|tlements, in the &s;ame manner. The A&s;&s;embly 1736, by an act, declared it the principles of this church, <HI>That no mini&s;ter &s;hould be intruded into any pari&s;h, con|trary to the will of the congregation.</HI> By their 7th act, they enjoin mini&s;ters and preachers to warn their hearers again&s;t any thing that tends to athei&s;m, de|i&s;m, Ariani&s;m, Sociniani&s;m, Arminiani&s;m, Bourig|niani&s;m, Popery, Super&s;tition, Antinomiani&s;m,&mdash;
<PB N="365" REF="365">
and to in&s;i&s;t in their &s;ermons on men's lo&s;t e&s;tate by nature, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upernatural grace, and of faith in the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t,&mdash;and chiefly labour to lead &s;inners from the covenant of works to that of grace for life and &s;alvation, and from &s;in and &s;elf to Chri&s;t as a &s;urety and &s;aviour;&mdash; and in pre&s;&s;ing holine&s;s, to &s;hew them their inabili|ty for, and aver&s;ion to every thing &s;piritually good, and that union with Chri&s;t is the true and only &s;ource of all grace and holine&s;s,&mdash;and that men's be&s;t per|formances and attainments are but lo&s;s and dung in point of ju&s;tification before God. And they enjoin profe&s;&s;ors of divinity to in&s;truct their &s;tudents in preaching the go&s;pel according to this act; and re|quire Pre&s;byteries, at their privy cen&s;ures, to en|quire concerning the ob&s;ervation of it. But the countenance given by the&s;e two la&s;t A&s;&s;emblies to &s;ome violent intru&s;ions, or to profe&s;&s;or Campbel's er|rors, made their good acts little regarded; and made the four &s;eceding mini&s;ters lo&s;e all inclinations or hopes of returning to the fellow&s;hip of the church.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, one captain <HI>Porteous,</HI> a mo&s;t aban|doned profligate, had been condemned to death for &s;everal murders, but had been reprieved for a time, by the intere&s;t of &s;ome great men. Provoked here|by, the mob, conducted by &s;ome &s;kilful leaders, han|ged him at Edinburgh in September, 1736. En|raged by their bold conduct, and perhaps, ground|le&s;ly apprehen&s;ive, that &s;ome of the more &s;trict mi|ni&s;ters, who dete&s;ted the reprieving of &s;uch a noto|rious murderer, had encouraged the mob, the king and Parliament, having framed an act for the di&s;co|very of his murderers, appointed all the mini&s;ters of Scotland to read it in the time of God's public wor|&s;hip in their churches, every fir&s;t &s;abbath in the month, for a whole year, beginning in Augu&s;t, 1737, under this penalty, for the fir&s;t day's neglect, <HI>That they &s;hall be declared incapable of &s;itting or voting in any church judicatory.</HI> Many mini&s;ters looking on &s;eve|ral things in the act as incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and
<PB N="366" REF="366">
equity; and that it was not proper for Chri&s;t's amba|&s;&s;adors of the go&s;pel of peace, to become heralds or executors of the &s;anguinary laws of men; that the reading of &s;uch a civil act from the pulpit, on the Lord's day, in the time of divine &s;ervice, was a pro|fanation of his &s;abbath and wor&s;hip; and that they could not acquie&s;ce in the penalty annexed to the fir&s;t neglect, without practically owning the civil ma|gi&s;trate <HI>head of the church,</HI> having power to fix the qualifications and conditions of mini&s;ters exerci&s;e of their office in governing the church of God, which they reckoned, at once contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine of this church, and to their own &s;olemn en|gagements to maintain it. Many others, e&s;pecially &s;uch as had, or wi&s;hed for, court favours, made a &s;hift to come over tho&s;e &s;cruples, and read at lea&s;t part of the act, the whole or part of the time. The&s;e different views and practices produced &s;ome alienati|on between the parties for a time; but, after a few years, they harmoniou&s;ly agreed to bury it in obli|vion.</P>
<P>The Seceding mini&s;ters publication of their <HI>&s;econd Te&s;timony,</HI> in which they had repre&s;ented the back|&s;lidings of church and &s;tate from their covenanted doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and government, and laudable acts and con&s;titutions for &s;upporting it, more plainly than mo&s;t of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy wi&s;hed,&mdash; and their &s;upplying of people with &s;ermon, who could not &s;ubmit to intruders, or &s;crupled to hear the rea|ders of the act concerning captain Porteous,&mdash;having highly di&s;plea&s;ed the eccle&s;ia&s;tical managers,&mdash;The A&s;&s;embly 1738, therefore appointed their commi&s;&s;i|on to libel and cite them to the next A&s;&s;embly. When they, now increa&s;ed to the number of eight, appear|ed at the bar, they were informed by the A&s;&s;embly, 1739, that they were ready to drop all that was con|tained in their libel and every thing bygone, and re|ceive them with open arms, providing they would, for the future, forbear all &s;eparating cour&s;es, and join in the communion of the church. But, in&s;tead of
<PB N="367" REF="367">
&s;uch compliance, the&s;e mini&s;ters &s;olemnly declined the A&s;&s;embly and other e&s;tabli&s;hed judicatories, as not right con&s;titute courts of Chri&s;t in their pre&s;ent condition, becau&s;e, in&s;tead of purging out, they re|ceived and &s;upported, intruders and other &s;candalous per&s;ons, as members; becau&s;e they had generally, for many years pa&s;t, been active in carrying on a cour&s;e of defection, tolerating the erroneous, coun|tenancing error, and enacting laws, by which the li|berties of Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters and people were &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed; and becau&s;e, by their reading of the Parlia|ment's act concerning captain Porteous, they had &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the civil magi&s;trate, as <HI>head of the church,</HI> in&s;tead of Chri&s;t. This <HI>declinature</HI> &s;o galled the managers and others of the prevailing par|ty, that without finding them guilty of either error in doctrine or &s;candal in practice, the A&s;&s;embly 1740 depo&s;ed them from all exerci&s;e of their mini&s;terial office in this church.</P>
<P>Since that period, things have been nothing bet|tered, but rather grown wor&s;e. While practical godline&s;s in per&s;ons and families hath &s;adly decayed, and error and impiety of almo&s;t every kind have pre|vailed, and become fa&s;hionable, &s;ettlements of mi|ni&s;ters have proceeded on the footing of Patronage. But long cu&s;tom hath rendered the&s;e, and all their &s;oul-ruining con&s;equences, le&s;s affecting, even to many of the godly. Errors, and even &s;candalous practices, unle&s;s extremely gro&s;s, ordinarily pa&s;s un|cen&s;ured. Violations of the&s;e commands, which immediately re&s;pect God him&s;elf, are by many rec|koned very venial, or no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. Little more than gro&s;s acts of murder or approaches to it; gro&s;s and notorious uncleanne&s;s, and e&s;pecially direct theft and robbery is practically held as either cen&s;urable by the church, or puni&s;hable by the &s;tate. The Se|ceders have now about two hundred mini&s;ters &s;ettled in Britain and Ireland, be&s;ides others in America. But their falling from their fir&s;t love, indulgence of conformity to the world, and their angry divi&s;ions,
<PB N="368" REF="368">
about things which many of them&s;elves do not fully under&s;tand, have exceedingly marred their u&s;eful|ne&s;s in maintaining Chri&s;t's injured truths, and win|ning &s;ouls to his &s;ervice. The Reformed Pre&s;byte|ry was formed about 1743, by Mr. John M'Millan a|bove-mentioned, and Thomas Nairn, who left the <HI>Sece&s;&s;ion.</HI> In many things they re&s;emble the Seceders, but differ from them, in impugning the pre&s;ent civil government. Their &s;plitting into parties, on a de|bate concerning the <HI>extent of Chri&s;t's death</HI> weakened the&s;e <HI>old di&s;&s;enters,</HI> as they call them&s;elves, and re|tarded their increa&s;e. The Pre&s;bytery of Relief o|riginated from Mr. Thomas Gille&s;py, whom the General A&s;&s;embly in 1751 depo&s;ed, becau&s;e he would not, contrary to his con&s;cience, a&s;&s;i&s;t in a violent in|tru&s;ion,&mdash;and &s;ome other mini&s;ters of the church of Scotland, who, at their own hand, left their e&s;ta|bli&s;hed charges, and took up with &s;uch people as in|vited them, in other places. Their &s;cheme of ad|mitting per&s;ons of different denominations to &s;ealing ordinances, and giving their people an an&s;werable allowance in hearing and joining in &s;ealing ordi|nances, is exceedingly &s;uited to the ta&s;te of the age. &mdash;But divi&s;ions and other incidents have not a little retarded their expected increa&s;e. Be&s;ides all the&s;e, there are, I think, between twenty and thir|ty thou&s;and Papi&s;ts, who, notwith&s;tanding all the laudable diligence of the Society for propagating Chri&s;tian knowledge in that country, do chiefly &s;warm in the north. How many Epi&s;copalian mini|&s;ters or people there be in Scotland at pre&s;ent, I do not certainly know.</P>
