<HEAD>Two Great Que&s;tions con&s;idered, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Thought at the Writing each of the&s;e Papers, that the Part before me would be the la&s;t; and have been always Cautious of Crowding the Reader of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays with too many Subjects.</P>
<P>But every Day brings with it New Occa&s;ions of Debate, and 'tis in Vain for me to re&s;olve upon &s;ilence, unle&s;s I will aban|done Truth, and &s;ee it every Day in&s;ulted with Errors, both in Practice and in Opinion.</P>
<P>I have &s;tood &s;till, and &s;een the Parliament throng'd with Addre&s;&s;es or Petitions, and &s;ome of them in an Unu&s;ual Stile, a Stile Parliaments in other Kingdoms re&s;ent with more Severity a great deal; I have &s;een Authority in&s;ulted, Her Maje&s;ty in the Per&s;on of Her Repre&s;entative very ill Treated, and all pa&s;t over with Lenity and Gentlene&s;s.&mdash;To this I have thought my &s;elf oblig'd to &s;ay nothing, as not in my Sphere: His Grace the High Commi&s;&s;ioner and the Parliament kno' how to re&s;ent, and when to re&s;ent; and 'tis not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to pre&s;ume to Direct.</P>
<P>But after all this, I cannot but take Notice of the Dialect of &s;ome People here, which to me is very &s;trange; who have been talking very Confidently, of going to ask the Parliament for an An&s;wer to their Addre&s;&s;es;&mdash;this in Engli&s;h, I take to be Equivalent to Calling the Parliament to Account: and &s;ome Gentlemen have as good as call'd it &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">Indeed their Re&s;olution has not been equal to their Project, and they have not yet thought fit to put their Schemes in Practice: but I thought it nece&s;&s;ary, for the Informa|tion of tho&s;e who pretend to ju&s;tifie &s;uch a Method, to examine a little the Nature, Right and Obligation of Adre&s;|&s;ing or Petitioning our Superiors, and &s;tate the Point of Duty between both Addre&s;&s;ers and the Per&s;ons Addre&s;&s;ed. And this is the fir&s;t Article I &s;hall enter upon in this E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Petitioning Parliaments, and the Duty in that Ca&s;e both of Parliament and People.</HEAD>
<P>AS this is a nicer Subject than ordinary, and he that writes upon it, may ea&s;ily be mi&s;under&s;tood; &s;o I de&s;ire a little to explain my &s;elf, before I proceed to the Particulars.</P>
<P>And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> I de&s;ire to note, that I &s;hall not di&s;tingui&s;h in this Di&s;cour&s;e between Addre&s;&s;ing and Petitioning; not but that there are E&s;&s;ential Differences between them, and which u&s;ed to be ob&s;erved by the People: Petitioning being applied to Reque&s;ts only, and Addre&s;&s;ing to every thing, congratu|lating, or otherwi&s;e &s;ummary in repre&s;enting the Subject, it is upon.</P>
<P>But Cu&s;tom has now brought the&s;e things together, the Addre&s;s is call'd a Petition, and the Petition an Addre&s;s: and as the Age makes no Di&s;tinction, neither do I; and therefore I de&s;ire thro' out this Paper to be under&s;tood promi&s;cuou&s;ly of both.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> I note here, that I &s;hall in no wi&s;e di&s;pute, whether it be lawful upon all Occa&s;ions for the People to Addre&s;s to, or Petition the Parliament.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take it for granted, and agree with any Body in this, <HI>That it is the undoubted Right of the People of any free Na|tion,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4"><HI>but particularly of the three Kingdoms of</HI> Scotland, England <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>to pre&s;ent their Grievances to their re&s;pective Au|thorities, be it King or Parliament or both, and to do it by Peti|tion, Addre&s;s, or any other way within the limited Pre&s;cription of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>When the&s;e Things by way of Note are fir&s;t granted, I know nothing more in the way of my Di&s;cour&s;e, but to come directly to the Subject of Petitioning or Addre&s;&s;ing of Parlia|ments; and in this 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>The Nature</HI> of Petitioning or Addre&s;&s;ing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>The Manner</HI> of Pre&s;enting.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>1. The Nature of Addre&s;&s;ing or Petitioning.</HEAD>
<P>And me thinks, I need go no further than the very words them&s;elves, which without troubling my &s;elf to dive into their Etymologies and Original, do plainly and ex|pre&s;ly &s;ignify <HI>the Po&s;ture of Supplicants</HI>; a Petition is in its Nature <HI>a Prayer,</HI> a Begging or Entreating; and let the Sub|ject of the Petition be never &s;o much Matter of Right, it is, by the Nature of the Thing, &s;ubmitted to the Plea&s;ure <HI>of the Per&s;ons Petitioned,</HI> either when to grant it, or in &s;uch manner as they &s;hall &s;ee meet, or not to grant it at all.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, we have of late &s;een different Steps taken in this Ca&s;e, and &s;ome Gentlemen are plea&s;ed to tell us of Addre&s;&s;es to the Parliament, <HI>Commanding them, &amp;c.</HI> Others in their Addre&s;&s;es, come with a <HI>We hope and confidently Expect, &amp;c.</HI> Of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>However the&s;e Gentlemen think of their Method, I mu&s;t take the Liberty to tell &s;uch, if they will act fairly, and give every thing its proper Stile, they &s;hould call &s;uch things, <HI>Re|pre&s;entations or Remon&s;trances</HI>; not Addre&s;&s;es or Petitions.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">And therefore in our own Memories, when the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> applyed them&s;elves to the late King <HI>William</HI> for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of their Privileges, they did not call it an Ad|dre&s;s or a Petition, but <HI>a Claim of Right.</HI></P>
<P>To petition or addre&s;s mu&s;t certainly acknowledge a Right in the Per&s;ons addre&s;&s;ed to, <HI>either to grant or not to grant the thing addre&s;&s;ed for</HI>; referring the Manner and Sea&s;on of Granting to them, and contents it &s;elf with having laid the Reque&s;t be|fore them.</P>
<P>All other or further pur&s;uing the Subject, is Tumultuary, and tends to Riot and Di&s;order, the thing cea&s;es then to be an Addre&s;s or a Petition, and becomes a <HI>Demand,</HI> a Force or <HI>Threatning of Force</HI>; which in its Nature, is ab&s;olutely De|&s;tructive of the very Being and Sub&s;tance of Government, tends to all manner of Di&s;orders, and cannot be call'd Petiti|oning:</P>
<P>And therefore, that Reverend Divine, that lately Preached in the <HI>New Kirk</HI> in this City, &s;peaking of this very thing, had this mo&s;t pertinent Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>That when he con&s;idered &s;ome of the Addre&s;&s;es here, they had on the Fronti&s;piece the Words</HI> AN HUMBLE PETITION: <HI>but if they were to Corre&s;pond</HI> with the Sub&s;tance, <HI>they &s;hould have been Stil'd</HI> A BOLD DECLARATION, <HI>in Oppo&s;ition to Authority,</HI> and that <HI>he could not under&s;tand the Meaning of a Petition or Addre&s;s,</HI> Sword in Hand.</P>
<P>No truly, nor can any Man el&s;e under&s;tand it by the Words; for <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Sword in Hand,</HI> are two contraries, that do not Illu&s;trate, but really De&s;troy one another.</P>
<P><HI>In &s;hort,</HI> to Addre&s;s or Petition, is <HI>to Pray,</HI> to <HI>De&s;ire</HI> and to Submit to the Wi&s;dom and Authority of the Per&s;on you Peti|tion or Addre&s;s to, for the Granting or not Granting the Re|que&s;t, all that goes beyond this, is Excentrick, Remote and Incon&s;i&s;tent, not only with the Due Re&s;pect of Subjects to
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Authority, but with the Nature &amp; Sub&s;tance of the Thing it &s;elf, and indeed ought not to go by the Name of <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> or <HI>Petition.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Flemings,</HI> in the time of <HI>Philip</HI> the II. made the Famous Petition to the Lady <HI>Infanta,</HI> then Governe&s;s of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI>&mdash;tho they Petitioned for their Native Right and Liberty of Religion, yet they Voluntarily took upon them the Name of <HI>Geux</HI> or Beggars, and were call'd &s;o on both &s;ides, &s;ignifying, That tho' it was really their Right they Demanded, yet while they did it by way of Petition, it ought to be agreeable to the Nature of a Petition, <HI>viz.</HI> as a Prayer or Humble Reque&s;t. I omit the Application of this part, till the la&s;t, and proceed to Examine,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>2. The Manner of Petitioning.</HEAD>
<P>This re&s;pects the Words of the Petition, and the Method of Petitioning.</P>
<P><HI>As to the Words</HI> or Terms of the Petition. As every Ser|mon ought to Conform to the Text, every Book to its Title, every Application to the Doctrine, &s;o every &s;uch Application to Authority, ought to Conform to the Title, which always bears the term HUMBLE in the Front of it, <HI>An Humble Addre&s;s,</HI> or <HI>An Humble Petition,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>I Confe&s;s there is room for Reflection enough here, where Humility takes up the Title, and all manner of In&s;olencies, Scandals, Reproaches, and unju&s;t A&s;&s;ertions, fill up the Bo|dies of Addre&s;&s;es; and Petitions are made in the Language of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Beggars, who they &s;ay, beg an Alms with the Hat in one hand, and the Sword in the other.</P>
<P>What el&s;e can we &s;ay of the Addre&s;&s;ers, that tell the Parli|ament, they are <HI>Acting contrary to the Fundamental Rights of the Nation; that their Votes are Incon&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of</HI> Scotland, <HI>En&s;laving them to</HI> England, <HI>and Surrendering the Liberties and Freedoms</HI> of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation; in plain Words,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>Betraying their Native Country to the</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>and De&s;troying that Foundation, which is their Duty to pre&s;erve and defend,</HI> and the like?</P>
<P>In all Nations &s;uch Addre&s;&s;ings have been e&s;teemed con|trary to the Duty of Subjects, contrary to the Nature of Ad|dre&s;&s;ing, and contrary to the Dignity of Authority; and there|fore the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> in the Ca&s;e of the Famous <HI>Kenti&s;h Petition</HI> &s;how'd their Re&s;entment, not at Petitioning in General, for that every Body allowed, was the Privilege of the Subject, but at the manner or Expre&s;&s;ion, the Words of which were, <HI>That they would turn their Humble Addre&s;&s;es into Bills of Supply.</HI> Now, tho' it was no Breach of Duty to Pe|tition the Parliament to &s;upply the King's wants for the Pub|lick Good; yet in this particular turn, the Parliament thought the Petitioners took upon them to Reproach the Hou&s;e, with trifling their time away in Complements and Addre&s;&s;es when the nece&s;&s;ity of the Nation called for &s;upply|ing the Publick for Action.</P>
<P>This as out of the Sphere of a Petition they re&s;ented, and therefore Voted, it <HI>Scandalous, In&s;olent, and Seditious</HI>; &s;end for the Per&s;ons who pre&s;ented it in Cu&s;tody, and afterwards committed them to the Gate-hou&s;e, tho' Gentlemen of the be&s;t Quality in their Country.</P>
<P>I am not arguing from hence, what &s;hould be done here, the Government here is Gentle, Mild, and bear a great deal; but they ought not to have the more In&s;ult put upon them for that very Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The manner or method of a Petition, ought to Corre&s;pond with its Title, be Humble, the Expre&s;sion Mode&s;t, the Diction Decent, Soft, and Void of every thing Di&s;re&s;pectful, Unmannerly, and much le&s;s Untrue, I mean the Language of it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">As <HI>to the manner of Delivery,</HI> this ought to be &s;till, more Courteou&s;ly managed, and to &s;ute <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> the Cu&s;toms of the Place in the Ca&s;e of Petitions, <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Per&s;ons Peti|tioning, and <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Per&s;ons who are Petitioned or Ad|dre&s;&s;ed to.</P>
<P>The Decency due to Government, and e&s;pecially to <HI>the Au|thority of Parliament,</HI> requires all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect, as it is the Supreme Authority of the Nation, the Body cloathed with the Sanction of <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> on one Hand, and <HI>Sovereign Judica|ture</HI> on the other.&mdash;An humble Petition, and humbly pre&s;ented, is without doubt, the ju&s;t Debt of applying to this Power.&mdash;All manner of Tumultuous A&s;&s;emblings, all manner of Threatning Appearances or Speeches, are in this Ca&s;e <HI>Scandalous, In&s;olent, and Seditious,</HI> to lead, direct, Com|mand, much le&s;s threaten and &s;peak roughly to them, is an In&s;olence de&s;tructive to the very Nature of Government, and the Di&s;tance of Subjects.&mdash;What tho' they are the Ser|vants of the State, and accountable for Ju&s;tice, Truth, and Liberty; yet, are they not &s;ubjected to the In&s;ults of the Sub|ject in the Execution of their Great Tru&s;t?&mdash;The Authori|ty they exerci&s;e is Sacred, and ought not to be treated with Di&s;re&s;pect or Contempt.</P>
<P>The long di&s;puted Ca&s;e of their being accountable, never amounted to more, than that they are accountable in Con|&s;cience, Honour and Intere&s;t: But it remains to prove, that ever any Member repre&s;enting his Country, can be called to account in any Court for things done in Parliament, either in this Kingdom, or in <HI>England</HI>; if they were, no Man would &s;erve his Country at that Price.</P>
<P><HI>The Method of Petitioning</HI> therefore in your Neighbouring Kingdom is thus far Confin'd by Law, to prevent all manner of Tumultuous A&s;&s;emblies, that <HI>not more than five Per&s;ons can appear at the pre&s;enting any Petition,</HI> be the Subject of it of
<PB N="10" REF="9">
never &s;o Publick a Nature: and this has effectually prevented the great Mi&s;chiefs of <HI>Riotous Petitioning,</HI> which in their turn have proved Pernicious, both to Government and to People in <HI>England,</HI> and mu&s;t have ill Con&s;equences in any Country where &s;uch Exorbitances are unre&s;train'd.</P>
<P>But &s;ay the Objectors again&s;t this Doctrine, Have we com|mitted all our Power to our Repre&s;entatives, and is it in their Power to Ruin us all? This brings me to the Third Head.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>3. Of the Duty of the Petitioned.</HEAD>
<P>And here I lay &s;ome Heads down for others to inlarge upon, for in this &s;mall Tract I have not Room.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. All our Civil Rights are not &s;ubjected, no not to Parliament, as particularly, 'tis not in their Power to take away the Right of being Repre&s;ented, tho' without doubt it is in their Power to Enlarge, or <HI>Con|tract, Settle, and Limit</HI> the Number of the Repre&s;enta|tives and the &s;pace of the Countries they &s;hall Repre|&s;ent. And whereas &s;ome infer from hence, That then they may re&s;olve the whole Repre&s;entative into <HI>a &s;ingle Per&s;on,</HI> and they think they have a mighty Victory in this.&mdash;I An&s;wer,&mdash;Every part of the King|dom, which has been a &s;eparate Government, mu&s;t be &s;eparately Repre&s;ented; becau&s;e its Right of being Repre&s;ented, began <HI>in its &s;eparate State,</HI> and cannot be taken away.&mdash;But yet every Kingdom, that by them&s;elves or their Repre&s;entatives, Con&s;ent even to Su&s;pend their being Repre&s;ented at all, may doubtle&s;s do it for a time, <HI>tho it cannot be for their Po&s;terity</HI>; becau&s;e the Right of being Repre&s;etned de|&s;cends with the Land, and <HI>the Free-holder him&s;elf cannot give it away,</HI> Charters, Burghs, or Corpora|tions,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
may be Forfeited and Disfranchi&s;ed, <HI>but the Free-hold Land</HI> &s;hall ever Entitle the Po&s;&s;e&s;sor to a Right of being Repre&s;ented.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>According to Mr. <HI>Hodges</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>The Repre&s;entative has all the Right and Power of the Free-holder</HI> P&mdash;:"</Q> And if &s;o, then he has this Authority much more, and may <HI>give away all,</HI> but I dare not run that length.<LIST>
<ITEM>2. A Repre&s;entative cannot bind Con&s;cience, or oblige in Contradiction to the Laws of GOD.&mdash;All their Votes, all their Authority cea&s;es, when once they Contraveen the expre&s;s Laws of GOD, and in that Ca&s;e, their Power is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> Di&s;&s;olved, and <HI>they cea&s;e to be a Legi&s;lature,</HI> in &s;o far only as they Act a|gain&s;t, or in Oppo&s;ition to the Divine Law, the Apo&s;tles Que&s;tion in that Ca&s;e &s;trongly implying the Negation.&mdash;<HI>Whether it be lawful to obey GOD rather than Man, judge ye?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Nor can they make Laws again&s;t Nature or Rea&s;on, but in every thing el&s;e they have the full Legi&s;lative and Judicature committed to them, and it can not be Rational to &s;ubject them to the Tumultuous Authority of their Con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>I know it is affirm'd here, That the Barons have a Right, if they plea&s;e, to Decline a Repre&s;entative, and come up and &s;it in Per&s;on, as the Peers do.</P>
<P>Whether they have &s;uch a Right or no, is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to Debate here, <HI>but I'll offer one Negative to &s;uch an ab&s;urd No|tion,</HI> that I believe will &s;erve to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>they cannot have &s;uch a Right now,</HI> for this Current Parliament; they having by their Election, already concluded them&s;elves <HI>for this time</HI>; if ever they have &s;uch a Right, <HI>which neverthele&s;s I do not grant,</HI> it mu&s;t be when a new Parliament is to be cho&s;en.&mdash;But the Ca&s;e, for this Parliament is Determin'd, and cannot be altered.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"><HI>But how far then is a Parliament obliged by the Addre&s;&s;es of the Heretors or Con&s;tituents, and what is their Duty in &s;uch Ca&s;es</HI>? For this is the Grand Que&s;tion before us.</P>
<P><HI>I An&s;wer,</HI> Addre&s;&s;es if decently <HI>Worded,</HI> Dutifully with re&s;pect to Authority <HI>Pre&s;ented,</HI> and Significant in their Nature, <HI>ought to be received</HI>; and in this part, I mu&s;t own, The Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> have been over and above, regard|ful of their Duty, for that they have received <HI>&s;uch</HI> Addre&s;&s;es, containing <HI>&s;uch</HI> In&s;ulting of their Authority, <HI>&s;uch</HI> Arraigning their Proceedings, <HI>&s;uch</HI> Leading their Voices, <HI>&s;uch</HI> Limi|ting their Legal Power, and <HI>&s;uch</HI> Indecent and Di&s;re&s;pectful Treating their Per&s;ons, as no Subject in the&s;e Ages have ever, that I remember, done with Impunity, in any Nation but this;&mdash;and therefore, I think, <HI>with Submi&s;&s;ion,</HI> no Objection will ly again&s;t them on that Score.&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor is it the Duty of Repre&s;entatives to receive only the Addre&s;&s;es of the Subjects; but indeed they &s;eem to me to owe a Reading, and <HI>if the Sub&s;tance require it,</HI> to con&s;ider and debate the Matters laid before them in it. If any Man &s;hall ask &s;o weak a Que&s;tion, as who &s;hall be Judge, whether the Sub&s;tance require their Debates or no? <HI>The Nature of De|bating an&s;wers that,</HI> for they can debate upon nothing el&s;e but the Merits of the Petition; And if they find it fri|volous or vexatious, without que&s;tion they may either <HI>lay it a&s;leep in the hou&s;e</HI> by the &s;till Voice of a general Neglect, or <HI>ca&s;t it back with Re&s;entment,</HI> as the Ca&s;e in their Opinion de|&s;erves; <HI>If this be not in their Choice,</HI> then it is no more an Ad|dre&s;s or Petition, but a Precept or <HI>Mandamus,</HI> the People &s;ign|ing it are no more <HI>Addre&s;&s;ers,</HI> Petitioners or <HI>De&s;irers,</HI> but <HI>Di|rectors</HI> and <HI>Preceptors,</HI> and the whole Scale of Order inverts to Democracy and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. Doubtle&s;s, and I believe any Member of Parliament will allow me this, if the Parliament in Ca&s;e of an Addre&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="12">
pre&s;ented, receiv'd and con&s;idered, find <HI>Matter of Right</HI> in it, the Subjects Grievances <HI>truly</HI> repre&s;ented, and the Demand <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> if an Oppre&s;&s;ion to be remedied, if injurious Encroach|ments on Right and Property are to be removed, if any thing previous be there <HI>laid before them,</HI> in which they &s;ee the Sub|ject injur'd, and that 'tis in their Power to right him; tho the Addre&s;&s;er be never <HI>&s;o</HI> mean, <HI>&s;o</HI> low, or <HI>&s;o</HI> de&s;picable, and tho the Injury were back'd with never <HI>&s;o much Power,</HI> they are bound in Duty, in Con&s;cience, and in regard to the Tru&s;t committed to them, to an&s;wer the &s;aid Reque&s;t, redre&s;s, right, re&s;tore, and help the injur'd People, who&s;e Rights they are entru&s;ted to protect and defend.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enlarge on the Duty of a Repre&s;entative, I &s;ee no Members here &s;tand in need of my weak In&s;tructions, or that want to be put in mind of their Duty to their Country.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>4. Of the Duty of Petitioners.</HEAD>
<P>I come now to the la&s;t Article, and the main Occa&s;ion of this Tract, the Duty of Per&s;ons addre&s;&s;ing or petitioning; for without que&s;tion there is a Duty due there too, how negli|gent &s;oever People are of it, and how willing &s;oever &s;ome are to forget the Obligation.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t begin with Negatives, and I cannot but put you in mind of the hone&s;t Mini&s;ter at the New Kirk, who told ye, that he did not under&s;tand addre&s;&s;ing to Authority with SWORD IN HAND: This, as that Gentleman very well &s;aid, is rather a bold Declaration, than an humble Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>If People will addre&s;s&mdash;let them do it <HI>like an Addre&s;s</HI>; if they will petition, let it be <HI>a Petition</HI>&mdash;On the other hand, if they will remon&s;trate, let them remon&s;trate, and be plain; if they have Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, no doubt the Parliament will hear them both ways: But to remon&s;trate and addre&s;s both

in a breath, that's like the <HI>French</HI> King making War while <HI>he gives Peace to</HI> Europe. To have it be an Humble Addre&s;s in the Title, and <HI>a bold Declaration</HI> in the Body of the Paper, this is neither Peace nor War; it looks no way and every way, all together: In &s;hort, 'tis neither Hone&s;t nor Legal; 'tis not Legal, becau&s;e 'tis again&s;t Government, and does not corre&s;|pond with lawful Authority; and 'tis not hone&s;t, becau&s;e it does not corre&s;pond <HI>with it &s;elf,</HI> it calls it &s;elf one thing, &amp; really is an|other; it has a Silken Face and a Steely Heart, a Smile on the Brow and a Grin in the Thought, 'tis Unju&s;t and Unfair.</P>
<P>If you will be call'd Addre&s;&s;ers or Petitioners, you mu&s;t act as &s;uch, or el&s;e 'tis hone&s;ter <HI>to quit the Title.</HI></P>
<P>The Duty of Addre&s;&s;ers, in the next place, is to leave the Matter of their Addre&s;&s;es to the Con&s;ideration of the Per&s;ons addre&s;&s;ed or petitioned, and to acquie&s;ce in their Determina|tion or Judgment: An Addre&s;s that will have <HI>no Nay,</HI> is no more an Addre&s;s, but, as I &s;aid before, a Precept and Dire|ction.</P>
<P>To &s;uch, <HI>for &s;uch I find here,</HI> I cannot but &s;peak a word by way of Direction.&mdash;At the &s;ame time that you plead for a Right of Petitioning, I hope you do not demand a Right, or by it mean a Right of directing.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I am at &s;ome lo&s;s to know how &s;ome Gentlemen, who addre&s;s'd the pre&s;ent Parliament, would have us to under&s;tand the&s;e Words, WE HOPE AND CONFIDENTLY EXPECT; Words frequently u&s;ed in &s;ome Addre&s;&s;es I have &s;een here, whether they really have any <HI>Confidence</HI> in the Parliament or no, I cannot tell; 'tis my Opinion, they have ENOUGH in the Expre&s;sion.</P>
<P>A Right of Petitioning, I agree, is undoubted, but what Authority the&s;e Gentlemen will bring for a Right to oblige the Parliament to follow their Di|rections, I cannot imagine any more, than I can how
<PB N="15" REF="14">
they would properly be called a Parliament, or Re|pre&s;entative, if that Power were left in the Per&s;ons they repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>As therefore, I would by no means le&s;&s;en the Au|thority of the People, in the Re&s;erves of Right left them, and <HI>which are not Committed to the Repre&s;enta|tives</HI>; &s;o I would by no means Reduce Parliaments to Mobs and Rabbles, and make them pay their Homage every day to the <HI>Ab&s;olute Directions</HI> of their Con&s;titu|ents; this were indeed, to &s;acrifice to OUR SOVEREIGN LORD, THE PEOPLE; this were to level the Legi&s;lators, as a late Author has it, <HI>to the Will and Humour of the People,</HI> State of the Controver&s;ie. <HI>Page</HI> 4. This were to make the Members Repre&s;entatives, and the Mob be the Parliament.

<P>The People, without doubt, have Committed to their Re|pre&s;entatives, the Management of all their Civil Affairs, the power of Making, Explaining, Amending, Executing and Re|pealing Laws.&mdash;In the&s;e terms, are concluded all the Tru&s;ts, that are contain'd in Life, Limb, Property and E&s;tate.&mdash;This Management extends to Subjecting Life and E&s;tate to Puni&s;h|ment for Crimes, Stating Protection to Property, and Admi|ni&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, Regulating, Altering, Limiting, and Declaring all things belonging to Government, Succe&s;&s;ion, Con&s;titution, and Executive Power.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e things, you are to Acquie&s;ce and Submit to the Determination of the Repre&s;entatives; <HI>you,</HI> mark that, <HI>your &s;elves</HI> having Con&s;tituted and Appointed them by a Volunta|ry Legal Choice, your Deputies, your Plenipotentiaries, to Concert, Settle and E&s;tabli&s;h all the&s;e things in your behalf.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">If your neare&s;t Relations break the Laws they make, you follow them to the Gibbet with Regret and Lamentations, at the Misfortune in Committing the Crime; but no Complaint at the <HI>Makers of the Law,</HI> ye Acquie&s;ce in that, as the Act and Deed of the Parliament.</P>
<P>'Tis hard, we &s;hould Acquie&s;ce in &s;ome things, and &s;cruple others, &s;ince their Authority is Equal in all.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid on this Part, will however bear this ju&s;t Inference, and 'tis one of the be&s;t U&s;es I can turn the Di&s;cour&s;e to, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>This Doctrine quite overthrows the Legality of People, fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ing, and then a&s;&s;embling to make an open De|mand of an An&s;wer, or what el&s;e they plea&s;e to call it to their Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e Gentlemen that find fault with the late Procla|mation, for preventing &s;uch A&s;&s;embling, as Illegal, can ne|ver defend the Legality of their Part, to come in a Body, as &s;ome People call it, expecting therefore the more Re&s;pect: This can have no other nor better Con&s;truction, than to &s;ay, We will make &s;uch an Appearance as &s;hall awe the Parlia|ment by our Numbers to grant our Demands.</P>
<P>I would not be a forward Cen&s;urer of the De&s;igns of any Body, further than Rea&s;on ju&s;tifies; but I cannot &s;ee it will bear any other Con&s;truction, and if not, then it is directly contrary to the very Nature of Addre&s;&s;ing, as well as to the Duty and Deference owing to Parliamentary Authority.</P>
<P>What can the meaning of Number be but Strength, what their Appearing, <HI>but Force?</HI> The Government therefore are highly ju&s;tified in exerting the needful Authority entru&s;ted to them for that end, in preventing the early Beginnings of tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, that contrary to the Nature and true Mean|ing of Addre&s;&s;ers, de&s;ign'd to have aw'd or influenc'd the Parliament in their Appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">Tho&s;e Gentlemen, who ever they are, that contriv'd that De&s;ign, were in my Opinion &s;trangely mi&s;taken in their Mea|&s;ures, and have &s;omething to account for to their Di&s;cretion, if they had really a De&s;ign to have in&s;ulted the Parliament; for they could not but imagine, that an Attempt of drawing to|gether undi&s;cerned, mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible in a City no bigger than this, and in a Government that <HI>God be prai&s;ed</HI> has their Eyes about them.</P>
<P>Nor could they expect, but at the fir&s;t Appearance of a Concour&s;e of Strangers, the Town would be allarm'd, their De&s;ign be di&s;covered, and con&s;equently prevented.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t own, they made amends for their want of Fore|ca&s;t in the De&s;ign, by the Di&s;cretion of laying it a&s;ide at la&s;t, and not ruining them&s;elves and their Friends upon the cer|tain De&s;truction of an impracticable Attempt; and I doubt not, they will be &s;en&s;ible by this time, that they were in the wrong.</P>
<P>But this by the way; that Part I am upon is in &s;hort thus: All Tumultuary Parts of Management in Matters of Addre&s;|&s;ing or Petitioning Parliaments or Governours, is not contra|ry to the Laws only, but contrary to the Nature of Addre&s;|&s;ing, contrary to the Duty of Subjects, and ought rather to be call'd, Bold Declarations in Oppo&s;ition to Legal Autho|rity.</P>

<HEAD>II. Of the Obligation of National Oaths</HEAD>
<P>THis is a new Point, and if handled, in a way that may &s;eem &s;omething new, the Gentlemen concerned will, I hope, not be under any Surprize; &s;ince it will only di&s;cover, that &s;ome People rai&s;ed their Scruples, more for want of due Enquiry, than from the real Difficulty of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">Mo&s;t People who have entred upon this Article, have a|mu&s;ed us with the Enquiries into the Extent of the Oaths and Obligations, which this Nation lyes under, and with Debat|ing how far they are, or are not binding to the Po&s;terity of tho&s;e that took them; and the&s;e Enquiries have one peculi|ar, which &s;eems very natural to them, <HI>(Scilicet)</HI> To leave People as much or more in the Dark, than they found them.</P>
<P>The various Opinions, and weak Arguments on both &s;ides, entangle the Subject, and &s;erve only to leave it a doubtful Point, which no body can unravel; &amp; this is what the Enemies of the Truth aim at, and are very well &s;atisfied with, and in|deed it an&s;wers their end but too well.</P>
<P>The Broachers of Opinions in the World, have in all Ages fled to this Refuge, <HI>viz.</HI> When &s;trength of Rea&s;oning, would not &s;upport their Errors, they &s;truggle to cloud the Argument with ab&s;trufe Conjectures, ambiguous Interpretations, dark and difficult Sugge&s;tions, and any thing that may render the Subject my&s;terious; for, that if once the Doctrine has but dif|ficulty enough in it, to divide the Opinions of Men, and have &s;ome be of one mind, and &s;ome of another in the matter, they gain the Point; and 'tis odd, but &s;ome e&s;pou&s;e it, be the Error never &s;o gro&s;s.</P>
<P>To avoid this Evil in the Ca&s;e in hand, to take from the Adver&s;ary the Advantage of making this a <HI>Moot point,</HI> and that leaving People Doubting and Un&s;atisfied, they may bring them out of Love with the occa&s;ion. I &s;hall come quite ano|ther way, <HI>and I hope a nearer way</HI> to the Truth.</P>
<P>To &s;tate the Que&s;tion right, is the way to make this plain Truth <HI>yet plainer,</HI> and I think it lyes as follows.</P>
<P><HI>There are National Obligations, which have been taken in</HI> Scot|land, <HI>either by us our Fathers, and which we hold our &s;elves e|qually bound to,&mdash;which in their Nature interfere with our Incor|porating with</HI> England, <HI>in the pre&s;ent propo&s;ed &V;nion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">That this is the true &s;tate of the Que&s;tion, I could prove from <HI>too many</HI> of the weak and ill temper'd Arguments, which &s;ome People have made u&s;e of in Publick, to Defend their Clamours at the Treaty; and which I only Conceal, becau&s;e I would not record the folly of the Per&s;ons, who, I hope, may in time, come to be better Inform'd, and I am unwilling to leave them any thing to blu&s;h at.</P>
<P>But to put my Argument right, I mu&s;t back it with one Authentick Quotation, <HI>viz.</HI> Out of the &s;o well known Addre&s;s of the Presbytery of <HI>Hamilton</HI> to the Parliament; a Thing I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention again in the cour&s;e of this Tract, the Words are thus.</P>
<P><HI>But that which more e&s;pecially obliges us in Duty and Con&s;ci|ence,</HI> as Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel of Peace, <HI>mo&s;t Humb|ly to Interpo&s;e with your Grace and Lord&s;hips, is, the Lamen|table and Di&s;tracted &s;tate of the Kingdom, and particularly the People under our Pa&s;toral Charge, from the</HI> &s;ad Appre|hen&s;ion they have <HI>of the Woful Con&s;equences of</HI> &s;uch an U|nion, <HI>to their Liberties, Civil and Religious;&mdash;And that</HI> IT CANNOT BE ENTRED INTO <HI>by the Nation,</HI> in the Terms, <HI>without Incurring the Guilt of</HI> NATIONAL PERJURY.</P>
<P>This is plain to my purpo&s;e, and Ju&s;tifies my propo&s;ed &s;tate of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;pend the Readers time here, to &s;tate the Obli|gations; nor &s;hall I repeat the Oaths or Covenants, which are here meant, further than to lay it down, ju&s;t as the Gentle|men them&s;elves alledge, <HI>viz.</HI> That having taken an Oath, or entred into a Solemn Engagement, either they or their Fathers, <HI>for that they &s;ay is all one,</HI> obliging them&s;elves, as far as &s;hall be in their power, to Support and Maintain the Reformation, of Religion again&s;t all Error or Novations what&s;oever, together with an Obligation to Maintain and Defend the Kings Per&s;on,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
the Laws and Parliamentary Authority, all the lawful Juri&s;|dictions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as may be &s;een at large, in the National Con|fe&s;sion.</P>
<P>This, they &s;ay, obliges them to have no Union, with a Na|tion profe&s;&s;ing contrary to this Principle; much le&s;s, with a Na|tion, who&s;e Church is e&s;tabli&s;ht upon that very Epi&s;copacy, which they think them&s;elves obliged by their Oath, and in both their National and Church Capacity, to Aboli&s;h and pull down.</P>
<P>Then as to Civil Matters, they are oblig'd, <HI>they &s;ay by this Oath,</HI> to Maintain and Defend the Parliament, Government and Sovereignty of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the like, which they appre|hend, they do not do by the Union.</P>
<P>I'll do the Gentlemen that Ju&s;tice, to acknowledge, that they begin very much to decline the la&s;t Objection, being, <HI>as they &s;earch into it,</HI> further and further Convinc'd, of the Weak|ne&s;s of that part;&mdash;and e&s;pecially as a thing they are not &s;o Solicitous about.&mdash;But as to the fir&s;t, they &s;eem very po&s;itive and warm in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not lay the &s;tre&s;s of this Matter, where the&s;e People do, and therefore the Triumph they make, over tho&s;e that Argue again&s;t the Obligation of National Oaths, on the Po&s;te|rity of the People taking them, &s;hall &s;tand them in no &s;tead here, for I'll readily grant them for Argument &s;ake, <HI>whether I believe it or no is not material,</HI> That the National Oaths or Co|venant, or both, which their Fathers took, has all that Obli|gation they alledge, <HI>let that al&s;o be what it will,</HI> on us their Children; That they having eaten the&s;e &s;our Grapes, our Teeth are &s;et on edge by them, and that by no Shift, Eva&s;ion, Subterfuge, or whatever Contrivance, we can be cleared of the Bond.</P>
<P>Having granted this, I hope no Man will take it ill, if I very narrowly &s;earch all the unhappy Policies of this perver&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Generation, to bring us in Bound <HI>by the&s;e National Obligations</HI> not to unite with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis not at all to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, whether we are bound by the&s;e Oaths, but whether do the&s;e Oaths prevent our joining with <HI>England</HI> in the Terms of the Union, and whether it be true or no, as is quoted from the Presbytery of <HI>Hamilton, That it cannot be entred into without incurring the Guilt of National Perjury.</HI></P>
<P>To enquire directly into this,&mdash;it will be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h here the Obligation of the Oath, and the Sub&s;tance of the Treaty of Union.</P>
<P>The Obligation is again&s;t the Inva&s;ions of Error, and for pre&s;erving the Purity of Religion; 'tis an Oath to maintain and defend the Presbyterian Government and Di&s;cipline of the Church. This I take to be a fair Ab&s;tract of it.</P>
<P>Now again&s;t this let us &s;et the Treaty, and &s;ee what are the Stipulations between the Two Kingdoms; and without running thro' the Articles, they con&s;i&s;t in general Heads of Agreement and mutual Coalition in Matters of Civil Go|vernment, Communication of Privileges, Regulations of State and <HI>Po&s;tulata</HI> of Trade.&mdash;And pray Gentlemen, take it along with you, there is not in the Treaty one word of the things contain'd in the Oaths we are upon; nor are any of the Heads of tho&s;e Oaths concern'd here: Of which pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Next, let us di&s;tingui&s;h here of the Subjects of the&s;e Oaths on one hand, and the Subjects of the Treaty on the other hand, and the &s;everal Capacities of either, as they re&s;pect the Ca&s;e in hand; and here we &s;hall find them al&s;o as di&s;tinct and unconcern'd, as if they were not the &s;ame Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Subjects of the Oaths are the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Na|tionally con&s;ider'd, in their Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Capacity, or the Peo|ple of <HI>Scotland</HI> in their Religious Capacity, as Presbyterians, reform'd from Popery and Prelacy, and erected in a Na|tional
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Church, which they engage &s;olemnly to defend; and I would have them defend it to the end of the World.</P>
<P>The Subjects of the Treaty of Union are the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in their Politick Capacity, as a Government under a limited Monarchy, a Queen reigning ve&s;ted with a Legal, Undoubted and Undi&s;puted Right; a Parliament Repre&s;ent|ing, Sitting and acting by Law, and both together legally, and beyond the Power of Cavil, ve&s;ted with Right and Au|thority, to debate of and determine every thing which may be for the Publick Good of the Body to be Governed, and which relates to Civil Right, Law, Ju&s;tice and Policy.</P>
<P>That to di&s;tingui&s;h the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> thus in their &s;e|veral Capacities Politick and Religious, is ju&s;t and to the Pur|po&s;e, will ea&s;ily appear in that they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd &s;o alrea|dy, both in the Nature of the Thing and in the different Pacts of Government.</P>
<P>The Government of the State, including all the latter Branch of the above Di&s;tinction, is entirely &s;eparate from, Uncon|cern'd with, has no Influence upon, nor is at all influenc'd by the Government of the Church, which is the former Branch of the &s;aid Di&s;tinction. The Parliament repre&s;ents the People in their Civil Capacity; the Church has no Voice in the Election, nor is at all Repre&s;ented there; nor is any thing co|gnizable there, relating to the Religious Capacity of any In|dividual Subject of <HI>Scotland</HI>: The Civil Government has in|deed the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick in its Protection, and 'tis its Duty to defend and &s;upport it.&mdash;But even the Queen and Parlia|ment cannot, no not by Law, dethrone the Power and Con|&s;titution of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as Presbyterian,&mdash;be|cau&s;e it will for ever be ju&s;t, as is expre&s;s'd in the Claim of Right, That the People ought to have that Religion e&s;tabli&s;h'd which is their own Choice.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">Nor are they di&s;tinct in the Government only, but in the very Per&s;ons governing; the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in their Civil Capacities, are governed by the Queen; and the Laws, Ju&s;tice and Legi&s;lature is lodg'd in the Queen, and the Parliament; and all Men are Subject to it.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in their Religious Capacity are go|verned by the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Authority of Se&s;&s;ion, Presbytery, Synod and A&s;&s;embly; and to the&s;e even the Sovereign and Parliament in their Eccle&s;ia&s;tick and Separate Capacity are plea&s;ed to be Subject.</P>
<P>Thus I defend the Di&s;tinction as to the Subjects of the re|&s;pective Ca&s;es before us.</P>
<P>Things thus &s;et clear of one another, and examin'd apart, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, to me it is one of the profounde&s;t My&s;teries in Nature; and I can &s;ee no &s;hadow of a Di&s;covery, how the Union of two Nations in their meer Civil and Politick Con|cerns, can affect their Religious Concern:</P>
<P>But to come nearer yet,&mdash;The&s;e Things are not only divided and di&s;tingui&s;h'd in their own Nature, but they are expre&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;h'd in the Treaty it &s;elf, which profe&s;&s;es to unite the two Kingdoms in their Civil and Politick Capacity, as to Oeconomy, Government, Intere&s;t and Commerce; but expre&s;ly re&s;erves to each, the Separate State and Ab&s;olute Independency of all their Religious Affairs.</P>
<P>To make this more clear, care was taken to remove all manner of Jealou&s;ies on either hand, by expre&s;ly providing, limiting and forbidding, That the Commi&s;&s;ioners on either &s;ide, &s;hould have any Authority, to Treat of Matters relating to the Church.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on was plain, the Union was not concern'd in it; the Churches in either Kingdom were &s;ettled, fixt and E&s;tabli&s;hed, and were &s;o to remain; They were not to Unite or to Treat about Uniting: the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Union
<PB N="24" REF="23">
is not to bring them together, but to keep them a&s;under; not to bring them into one Government, but to &s;ecure them in their being two.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in their Religious Capacity, have no Concern in the Treaty, they are not at all Uniting, the Pale of Di&s;tinction is as firm, and if I may &s;ay it, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> better Secured, and bet|ter Fixt as to Humane Power, than ever it was before: hav|ing the Faith of a Treaty, perhaps more Solemn than ever was yet made in the World to Support her, and all the Men of Hone&s;ty and Principle in the whole I&s;land, to Support and Defend, to Recognize and &s;ee to the Execution of that Treaty.</P>
<P>If then the Independency of the Religious Government in <HI>Scotland</HI> be thus re&s;erv'd and &s;ecur'd, I cannot &s;ee which way the Oaths or Covenants of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Religious Matters, are any way infring'd, becau&s;e indeed, not any way concern'd in, or &s;ubjected to any Article of the Treaty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Objection I meet with here, is, Yet we are &s;ub|jected to the Legi&s;lation of Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>To this much might be &s;aid, as that they are Barons, and Vote in the Hou&s;e of Lords as &s;uch, but exerci&s;e no Spiritual Authority there: And I do not &s;ee, but if an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick in <HI>Scotland,</HI> either by Blood came to be a Peer, or by Vote was Cho&s;en a Repre&s;entative in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he might &s;it in Par|liament too; but I wave that. My direct An&s;wer here, is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You as a Church, have no hand in the placing them there; for in your Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Capacity, you have no Concern in the &V;nion at all, nor the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> neither.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To clear your Con&s;ciences from the Guilt, and your &s;elves from the Subjection, you Prote&s;t again&s;t your
<PB N="25" REF="24">
being Subjected in any Religious Matters to their Vote.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And let what Pretences &s;o ever be made here, I &s;ee no Room for any Que&s;tion, whether this does not effectually clear you, &s;ince you have neither Agency in the Fact, nor are &s;ubjected to the Con&s;equences. How then can the Oath be affected here?</P>
<P N="2">2. But &s;ay &s;ome Gentlemen, <HI>more willing to be Scrupulous than to be an&s;wered</HI>; We are bound, as far as lyes in us, to pull down Prelacy, even in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This is a wild Objection, I confe&s;s, and more wildly made u&s;e of by &s;ome People.</P>
<P>Either this is an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Obligation, or a Civil one, both it cannot be.</P>
<P>If it be a Civil Obligation, how will you under&s;tand it? Are you to do it by Force? If &s;o, the very Words, <HI>As far as in our Power</HI> are again&s;t you, <HI>&V;ltra po&s;&s;e non e&s;t e&s;&s;e.</HI> I pre|&s;ume, no Man will &s;ay, he is bound to the Attempt, whether po&s;&s;ible or no, like the Fifth Monarchy-mad-men in <HI>England,</HI> who were to Crown King <HI>Je&s;us</HI> with an Army of 25 Men, and &s;o went out <HI>to fight the Lord again&s;t the Mighty.</HI> 'Tis plain, the Impo&s;&s;ibility on that &s;ide Di&s;&s;olves the Nature of the Oath.</P>
<P>If it be an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Oath, it mu&s;t be executed in an Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical manner, and here all your Weapons are put into your Hands, and a fair Field given you; and I long, I con|fe&s;s, to &s;ee the War begun. But what are the Weapons? Tru|ly they are terrible ones, <HI>THE WORD</HI> and <HI>PRAYER</HI>; and here you may Execute your Engagements to the full, <HI>PRAY</HI> them down, and <HI>PREACH</HI> them down, and <HI>LIVE</HI> them down; and the &s;ooner this Strife begins, the better, I am &s;ure the Union will be far from Ob&s;tructing it; and I
<PB N="26" REF="25">
wi&s;h all the Strife in <HI>Britain,</HI> I mean as to Religion, was re|duced to this.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, to any that are willing to judge Impartially, it mu&s;t be evident, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has no manner of Concern in this Treaty as a Church, her E&s;tabli&s;hment is founded upon the Laws, which Laws are made Inviolable by the Treaty, no ways &s;ubjected to the Parliamentary Power that &s;hall follow, and Con&s;equently intirely free from the Legi&s;lation of the Epi&s;copal Clergy of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Foundation being laid, it mu&s;t follow, that the Oaths or Obligations in&s;i&s;ted upon here, are not at all affected by this &V;nion; And therefore, with Submi&s;sion to the <HI>Pre&s;|bytery of</HI> Hamilton, there can be no &s;hadow <HI>of National Perjury in it.</HI></P>
<P>As to any parts of the Oaths which &s;eems to engage the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> not to alter their Con&s;titution, it would be Ridiculous and Ab&s;urd. For then, (1<HI>mo.</HI>) They mu&s;t pretend they are Bound never to mend their Condition, tho' the greate&s;t Advantages in the World were to be offered them. (2<HI>do.</HI>) Tho' Subver&s;ion at Home, or Inva&s;ion Abroad, offered it &s;elf, they could not <HI>Unite</HI> with any Body, tho for the &s;upport &amp; Pre&s;ervation of them&s;elves, to bind them&s;elves to the&s;e things, would make it an unlawful Oath, for every Man, and every Go|vernment, is bound to do all po&s;sible and lawful things for the Good and Advantage of the Publick, and to Swear not to do that Good which is your Duty would be unlawful.</P>
<P>All the Cavils at the Form have been effectually an&s;wer'd already; I &s;hall repeat nothing, nor enquire any more into the Sugge&s;tions, of the Treaty being an entire Surrender of the Con&s;titution di&s;&s;olving, &s;ubjecting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The word U|NION is an An&s;wer to it; Union cannot be a Subjection; the word TREATY is another; How can a Treaty upon
<PB N="27" REF="26">
Conditions be a Surrender of Freedom? how can making of Agreements upon Articles be call'd a Subjection?</P>
<P>I &s;ee nothing needful to add to this Argument: I would be glad to hear what any Mens Scruples may dictate by way of further Objection; But till then I mu&s;t conclude, the Oaths and National Obligations of the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are not at all concern'd in this Union, how binding &s;oever they may be in other Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>To fill People then with Scruples at the Publick Affairs, and alarm them with breaking Oaths, National Perjury, and the like: Where the Oath is not at all concern'd, is nothing but the Effect of Party In&s;inuations, a Handle form'd to be taken hold of to &s;erve a Turn, and to fright Innocent People from joining in the Good of their Native Country.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I know not what to &s;ay to the Multiplying Oaths on either hand, and heartily wi&s;h, neither Nation were &s;o much encumbred with them, as they are. A General Uni|on of Temper and Affection, which, I hope, will at la&s;t fol|low the Union of Politicks, will &s;oon take away, not the Obli|gation, but the occa&s;ion of the&s;e Bonds from us all.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore &s;ufficiently Applaud the Prudence of the Publick, in the ca&s;e of a new invented Oath here, lately of|fered in the Commi&s;&s;ion, and afterward in Parliament, and Rejected in both.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think there are good Rea&s;ons to be given again&s;t Impo&s;ing Oaths of any &s;ort upon the Subject, other than the common Oath of Obedience to the Government, which is a Reciprocal Obligation; the King or Queen taking an Oath to Govern, and the Subjects to Obey, and both with this San|ction, as the Te&s;t of the Obligation, <HI>viz.</HI> ACCORDING TO LAW.</P>
<P>The frequency of Oaths, has in my Ob&s;ervation, the&s;e Fa|tal but Con&s;tant Mi&s;chiefs attending it. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it tends
<PB N="28" REF="27">
to le&s;&s;ening the Solemnity of the thing, by making a formal Swearing familiar to the People; and I could give &s;ad In&s;tan|ces of this in <HI>England,</HI> where the Word a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Oath is become &s;uch a Proverb, and the thing &s;uch a Je&s;t, that 'tis fitter to be called a Cu&s;tomary Oath; and in &s;ome other Ca&s;es, I believe, I could in&s;tance in &s;ome Oaths of Freedoms and Corporations, which I may &s;ay, 'tis Impo&s;&s;ible to keep.</P>
<P>If the&s;e things are true, as I do not de&s;ire to prove, be|cau&s;e I had rather conceal them; I think, they &s;hould caution any Nation again&s;t Crouding the People with Oaths, and e|&s;pecially unnece&s;&s;ary ones.</P>
<P N="2">2. In all kinds of Oaths relating to payment of Taxes, there are &s;nares to the People, and this effect follows of cour&s;e, that he gets mo&s;t Money who&s;e Con&s;cience is loo&s;e&s;t, he that can Swear harde&s;t, pays lea&s;t; and the Man of Con&s;cience, who dare not Tamper with his Maker, nor hurry up his Meaning in Suppo&s;itions, but when he is to Swear, con&s;iders of the Fact, and confines him&s;elf to the Truth, lyes under the Di&s;couragement of paying the mo&s;t Duties, and being Under|&s;old and Injured in his Trade.</P>
<P>This is my Ob&s;ervation, only on Oaths in general, but as to Religious Te&s;ts and Oaths, by way of Equivalent, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, there is &s;omething A&s;toni&s;hing in it, to &s;ee &s;ome Gentle|men warm for them, that have &s;o freely Cen&s;ured, and per|haps too ju&s;tly, their Neighbours, for making the like.</P>
<P>I frankly own, I believe the Sacramental Te&s;t Impo&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> a thing unlawful in its Nature, and Irreligious, as it is a Deba&s;ing the Sacred In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to U&s;es Differing, Remote and perhaps Contrary, to their Primitive In&s;titution; and I make no que&s;tion, but even the Church of <HI>England</HI> them&s;elves, when further Inlightned from Heaven, and the time of their Compleat Reformation &s;hall come, will free the Nation from tho&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Fetters, which are the
<PB N="29" REF="28">
only remains of the Tyranny and Popi&s;h Practices of the late Abdicated times.</P>
<P>But how it came into the Thoughts of any People here, <HI>who at the &s;ame time have been very free with</HI> England <HI>on that head,</HI> to fall into the &s;ame evil, and prepare the very &s;ame Chains for their Native Country, under which their Neighbours &s;o loudly groan, and for which they &s;o loudly have blam'd them, is a My&s;tery pa&s;t my under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The Parliament have therefore very wi&s;ely Rejected their Propo&s;al, as the Commi&s;&s;ion had done before; and the Gentle|men, who too ha&s;tily came in to it, will I doubt not, in time &s;ee, that they have cau&s;e to be Thankful, for being deliver|ed, tho' again&s;t their Wills.</P>
<P>I kno' 'twill be objected here, that the Oath propo&s;ed, was only de&s;ign'd for &s;uch of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that &s;hould come to enjoy Places of Tru&s;t or Profit in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But give me leave, to let &s;uch Gentlemen know, that ye had thereby opened the Door to the thing in general; and by Approving the placing Religious Oaths, on their Civil Im|ployments, tho now confin'd to Strangers, they for ever &s;top|ped their own Mouths, again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible Objection, if the &s;ame in time to come, &s;hould on any other occa&s;ion be ex|pected of them.</P>
<P>They could never have argued again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of the thing; they could never have fenc'd again&s;t the Propha|ne&s;s and Irreligion of it, the Dishonour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is to the In&s;titu|tion and Nature of an Oath, &s;ince their Mouths would be ef|fectually &s;topp'd, by telling them, That when it &s;erv'd their own turn, they could de&s;cend to the very &s;ame thing, and were for hampering the Con&s;ciences of others.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, who is it they would have bound to own the Pres|byterian Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> upon Oath? And let us examine a little the Rea&s;on and Kindne&s;s of it.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">The An&s;wer will be ready, I kno', <HI>'tis the</HI> Engli&s;h&mdash;Well, Gentlemen, and who among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would you entangle thus? the hone&s;t Men or the Knaves? 'Tis plain, the la&s;t will not be entangled by it, for they'll take fourty Oaths to get a good Place; there's none but the hone&s;t Men that you can have a De&s;ign upon, and 'tis a little hard you &s;hould contrive Methods to let the Knaves in among you, and &s;hut hone&s;t Men out.</P>
<P>Well, but &s;ays another warm Gentleman, We would keep Church of <HI>England</HI> Men out in general.&mdash;</P>
<P>Say you &s;o, Sir, Then you &s;hould have alter'd your Oath, and have made it, that the Per&s;on &s;hould have &s;worn, That he was not of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or to abjure Epi&s;copacy, or &s;ome Oath particularly bent again&s;t Prelacy in general, or the Church of <HI>England</HI> in particular: But 'tis plain, this Oath would as effectually have fore-clo&s;ed three parts in four of all the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> as well as all that were Con&s;cienti|ous among the Church; So that in &s;hort only one Sect of Di&s;|&s;enters might come among you; for which many of your hone&s;t Brethren of the Di&s;&s;enters, with whom you make no &s;cruple to join in Communion, when you come to <HI>England,</HI> are exclud|ed, for which they are very much beholding to you.</P>
<P>I might here enter upon a Debate again&s;t the making an Oath of Faith;&mdash;I believe there is room to que&s;tion, whe|ther in the Nature of the Thing, call'd Faith, every Man can &s;wear to what he believes, &s;wear that he believes this or that Church to be the only true Church, or this or that Wor|&s;hip to be the only true Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e I mu&s;t own, I think 'tis very hard to make any Man &s;wear, <HI>as in a certain Oath is expre&s;s'd,</HI> to continue in the Profe&s;&s;ion &amp; Obedience of this or that Religion or Opinion all the days of our Lives; whereas perhaps the Per&s;on may be &s;ome
<PB N="31" REF="30">
time or other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his Con&s;cience with Convictions, that he ought to alter &s;ome part of that Profe&s;&s;ion, either as to Doctrine or Di&s;cipline, Fundamental or Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>But I omit entring on this Debate, not that I think it dif|ficult, but with the Apo&s;tle I &s;ay, I hope without prophane&s;s, <HI>I have many things to &s;ay, but you cannot bear them now.</HI></P>
<P>The End of this Di&s;cour&s;e is in order to open the Eyes of tho&s;e well-meaning People, who &s;eem prejudic'd, that the Parliament has not agreed to the propo&s;ed Oaths, but has cau|tiou&s;ly refu&s;ed to put that Knife into their Hands, with which they would ha' wounded them&s;elves.</P>
<P>They can have no Rea&s;on to be unea&s;y at this, &s;ince 'tis what no Man can defend; 'tis the Burthen, the Bondage, and in my Opinion the Scandal of their Neighbour Nation; and what I could &s;ay, if the Sea&s;on were proper, this Treaty would in &s;ome mea&s;ure ha' delivered them from, had the Gentlemen here not thought fit to rai&s;e that Devil, which, I doubt, will not be in their Power to lay. But of this I may have occa&s;ion to &s;peak hereafter, and at pre&s;ent do not think it rea&s;onable to explain my &s;elf further.</P>
<P>I believe both Nations free&s;t from Bondage when they are free&s;t from Oaths of Di&s;tinction; and while they continue, I &s;hall never e&s;teem the Union as perfect in all its parts, to have, made new ones here therefore, would have been a Step to prevent, or at lea&s;t delay, that more Chri&s;tian Union of Hearts and Affections among all the Subjects of <HI>Britain:</HI> which all wi&s;e Men wi&s;h, and good Men pray for.</P>
