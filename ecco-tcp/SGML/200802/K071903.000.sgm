</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FOR all the u&s;eful and honourable purpo&s;es of national power, many circum&s;tances contri|buted to give us the lead of Europe, while the French revolution was depending. In the year 1792, we might have dictated a pacification to the contending parties; or, if that failed, a well-ordered and a well-armed neutrality would have kept us in peace. The riches of the world would have flowed into this i&s;land, not only from the &s;ources of its own commerce, improving and undi&s;turbed, but even from the calamities of other nations. The peculiar advantages of that fortunate &s;ituation were too obvious to be mi&s;taken. In departing from it, the mini&s;ter could have no ju&s;tification, but direct and irre&s;i&s;tible nece&s;&s;ity. To pre&s;erve &s;uch advan|tages, punctilios and formalities &s;hould have been di&s;regarded, and every di&s;po&s;ition, to explain and accommodate any &s;erious cau&s;e of offence, &s;hould have been accepted and encouraged. The guilt of the war, if it was voluntary, is to be mea&s;ured, as all criminal actions are, by its effects. When things are well, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s and duty of the executive government to keep them &s;o. Great and certain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is not to be hazarded for preca|rious acqui&s;ition; much le&s;s are &s;afety and happi|ne&s;s to be a &s;ubject of experiment. The actual &s;tate
<PB N="2" REF="4">
of England is the re&s;ult of other maxims. The dif|ficulties of the country have evidently grown with its exertions; and now we are called upon for efforts and contributions, which indicate a cri&s;is of immi|nent danger, to be averted by the wi&s;dom, or repel|led by the vigour of the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration. Whether the conduct and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the war furni&s;h a rational ground of confidence in their abilities, is a que&s;tion open to the under&s;tanding of all men. That which touches their integrity, is not &s;o ea&s;ily deter|mined, nor by the &s;ame &s;ort of evidence. But it is, if po&s;&s;ible, more important, and cannot be reviewed too often, or canva&s;&s;ed too minutely. Under <HI>any</HI> ad|mini&s;tration, the &s;pirit of the people is &s;ufficient to repel and defeat a direct attack. If it were po&s;&s;ible for the enemy to land in force, a great deal of tran|&s;itory mi&s;chief would en&s;ue; but, &s;ooner or later, they mu&s;t peri&s;h in the attempt. This is not by any means the mo&s;t di&s;couraging view of our &s;itu|ation. A war prolonged without action or enter|pri&s;e, an inva&s;ion threatened and &s;u&s;pended, and the expectation of it continually hanging over us, are the &s;ure&s;t, and, for the enemy them&s;elves, the &s;afe&s;t in&s;truments to accompli&s;h the ruin of England. In the nature of things, this plan, if they adhere to it, cannot fail. To talk of expecting moderation and candour from a government provoked by in|jury and incen&s;ed by in&s;ults, to call them traitors and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and in the &s;ame breath to reproach them with arrogance and treachery, as if the cha|racter and the qualities were incompatible, is mere folly and impertinence. The &s;erious que&s;tion is, not whether the&s;e people are good or bad, but by what means we are ever to be at peace with them. Then comes the importance of an inquiry into the principles and proceedings of our own government, as far as that of France has been affected by them. If the re&s;ult of it &s;hould lead to a conclu&s;ion, mo|rally
<PB N="3" REF="5">
certain, that the Directory will never treat with them but as with rancorous enemies, and as the wilful authors of all the calamities of France, it follows of nece&s;&s;ity that other men ought to be tried; unle&s;s it be contended, that the removal of &s;uch per&s;ons is too great a price to pay for the &s;alvation of the country.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters affirm, that, in 1793, the war was ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary on the part of Great Bri|tain; and that, in 1796 and 1797, their endeavours to make peace, and to renew the intercour&s;e with France, were &s;erious and &s;incere. On the other &s;ide it is a&s;&s;erted, that both the&s;e propo&s;itions may be fal&s;e, but that both of them cannot be true, unle&s;s it can be proved that, in 1796, the character of the war was altered by events, which made the conti|nuance of it, on its original principles, unju&s;t and unnece&s;&s;ary. The i&s;&s;ue to be tried is, whether the mini&s;try did all they could at fir&s;t to avoid the war, and, at la&s;t, to put an end to it.</P>
<P>On the 18th of June 1792, Mon&s;ieur Chauvelin, in the name of Louis the Sixteenth, invited his Maje&s;ty to <Q>find &s;ome means to put a &s;top to the progre&s;s of a confederacy again&s;t France, which threatened the peace, the liberty, and the hap|pine&s;s of Europe.</Q> In return to this amicable appeal to his Maje&s;ty's wi&s;dom, friend&s;hip, and good faith, he was informed that <Q>His Maje&s;ty thought that, in the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances of the war then begun the interpo&s;ition of his councils, or of his good offices, could be of no u&s;e, unle&s;s it was de&s;ired by <HI>all</HI> the parties con|cerned.</Q> The pretence is weak and in&s;ufficient; but it proves the di&s;po&s;ition. When <HI>all</HI> the parties in a war agree to de&s;ire the interpo&s;ition of a neu|tral power, no friendly offices are wanted to bring them back to a pacific temper.&mdash;Peace is almo&s;t as good as made, when <HI>all</HI> the contending parties are
<PB N="4" REF="6">
di&s;po&s;ed to de&s;ire it. The obvious duty of a com|mon friend, the true policy of a generous, or even of a prudent government, is to employ its good offices, and to exert its influence with tho&s;e powers, which may be le&s;s inclined to views of moderation, to encourage and promote a pacific di&s;po&s;ition, and to favour that party, which &s;eems the readie&s;t to li&s;ten to rea&s;onable overtures, and to make conce&s;|&s;ions for the benefit of general accommodation. Such were the wi&s;e and honourable duties of England, when his Maje&s;ty's mediation was &s;olicited and re|fu&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 27th of December 1792, Lord Grenville charged the French Convention with having pa&s;&s;ed a decree <HI>calculated to encourage di&s;cord and revolt in every country.</HI> The French mini&s;try denied and di&s;|claimed the &s;en&s;e attributed to the decree, and, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, di&s;avowed any intention, on the part of France, to act on the principles imputed to that government. When no act has been done, and when nothing but a &s;uppo&s;ed principle, or general di&s;po&s;ition, is complained of, an expre&s;s di&s;avowal of &s;uch principle and denial of &s;uch intention ought to be accepted; becau&s;e it is all that the ca&s;e admits of. A mini&s;ter, who had &s;eriou&s;ly meant to pre&s;erve peace, would have allowed them to know their own meaning, even tho' he had di&s;tru&s;ted their &s;incerity. In&s;tead of that, he &s;ays drily, <Q>I cannot conceal from you, that I have found nothing &s;atisfactory in the re&s;ult of your note, and we &s;hall continue our preparations.</Q></P>
<P>On the 31&s;t December 1792, he tells Mon&s;ieur Chauvelin, who had taken the &s;tyle of <HI>Mini&s;ter Ple|nipotentiary of France,</HI> <Q>that his letters of credence were from the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and that he could not be admitted to treat with the King's Mi|ni&s;ters in the quality he had a&s;&s;umed.</Q></P>
<P>On the 7th of January 1793, Mon&s;ieur Chauvelin
<PB N="5" REF="7">
appears to have addre&s;&s;ed two memorials to Lord Grenville. In the fir&s;t he complains, and demon|&s;trates beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of reply, that the Alien Bill, moved by His Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters and depen|ding in Parliament, and not making any exception in favour of France, was a direct violation of the Commercial treaty concluded in 1786, by which it was &s;tipulated <Q>that the &s;ubjects and inhabitants of the two countries &s;hould have liberty to pa&s;s and repa&s;s freely and &s;ecurely, without licence or pa&s;&s;|port,</Q> &amp;c. and that this propo&s;ed law, under a ge|neral term of de&s;ignation, was principally directed again&s;t the French.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd he repre&s;ents that &s;hips, freighted with corn for France, were &s;topt by order of Govern|ment, and that, when the prohibition was taken off generally, as far as regarded <HI>foreign</HI> wheat, it was &s;till enforced again&s;t France, and again&s;t France alone. The&s;e complaints were &s;upported by argu|ments in detail, which it would have been difficult to an&s;wer in the &s;ame form: but that, which can|not ea&s;ily be an&s;wered, may very ea&s;ily be &s;lighted. Lord Grenville returns the fir&s;t of the&s;e memorials, in a note of &s;ix lines, <HI>as totally inadmi&s;&s;ible.</HI> Why? Becau&s;e Mon&s;ieur Chauvelin a&s;&s;umes a character, which is not acknowledged. To the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;econd memorial he returns no an&s;wer at all. Why? Fir&s;t, <Q>becau&s;e it had been thought pre|ferable in France <HI>to bring forward difficulties of form.</HI></Q> Secondly, <Q>becau&s;e he did not know in what character Mon&s;ieur Chauvelin addre&s;&s;ed him.</Q> An objection to a diplomatic character, when there is no doubt of the authority, is a diffi|culty of form, and nothing el&s;e, and very unfit to be in&s;i&s;ted on in &s;o great and grave a que&s;tion as that of involving two nations in the mi&s;eries of war. The language of power may be laconic, and they, who cannot re&s;i&s;t, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to it. But &s;uch
<PB N="6" REF="8">
an&s;wers between equals are not to be endured. The noble Lord has been taught to lengthen his mono|&s;yllables. The provi&s;ions of the Alien Bill are in direct and evident contradiction to the Commercial Treaty. Do His Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters mean to &s;ay that a treaty, concluded by the Crown, may be an|nulled by a &s;ub&s;equent Act of Parliament? If it may, in the fir&s;t place, no foreign power is &s;afe in treating with the Crown; and then what right have we to deny that the French Directory may be re&s;trained by a previous act of their con&s;titution from making particular conce&s;&s;ions, or to affirm, as we have done, <Q>that there exi&s;ted a <HI>droit public</HI> in Europe paramount to any <HI>droit public</HI> they might think proper to e&s;tabli&s;h in their own domi|nions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Malme&s;bury, December 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, 1796.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>On the 20th of January 1793, Lord Grenville po&s;itively refu&s;ed to receive his new credentials from the Republic, and on the 24th, &s;ent him an order to quit the kingdom.</P>
<P>Very early in that year the French were humbled by a variety of rever&s;es and di&s;a&s;ters, and ready to &s;ubmit to any terms for an accommodation with England. On the 28th of February, another Mini&s;|ter Plenipotentiary (Mon&s;ieur Maret) arrived in England. It is not certain that his offers and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions were li&s;tened to at all; but it was &s;aid that they were rejected as incompatible with the honour and dignity of the Engli&s;h nation to accept; and, on the 4th of March, he was ordered to quit the kingdom in three days. In the beginning of April, Mon&s;ieur le Brun, Mini&s;ter for Foreign Affairs, wrote to Lord Grenville, to de&s;ire a pa&s;&s;port for a per&s;on ve&s;ted with full powers to terminate all dif|ferences with Great Britain. Of this reque&s;t no &s;ort of notice was taken. Short-&s;ighted pride makes no
<PB N="7" REF="9">
provi&s;ion for the returning days of humiliation and repentance. When pacific offers and &s;olicitations are neglected, or an&s;wered only with formalities, you may be &s;ure that the cavillers have taken their re&s;olution. The motives and the arguments <HI>follow</HI> the inclination.</P>
<P>In December 1792, the French, having got po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greater part of Flanders, re&s;olved to &s;end &s;ome of their ve&s;&s;els up the Scheldt to attack Antwerp. How this act was received by the Briti&s;h Government is fre&s;h in the memory of all men. If the French had &s;ent a fleet into the Thames, the outcry rai&s;ed again&s;t them could not have been more violent. Nobody could endure it, but the Dutch them&s;elves, who &s;howed no &s;ign of life, and were very unwilling that we &s;hould meddle with their affairs. They had no anxiety about the navigation of the Scheldt. What they really dreaded was our interpo&s;ition and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. We forced it upon them, we drove them into the war, and we accompli&s;hed their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But it was &s;aid that the real &s;ources of the war lay deeper than in any offences or provocation of this &s;ort; that other cau&s;es of difference might have been accommodated, but that French principles were never to be tolerated or forgiven, much le&s;s to be admitted among&s;t us. While all manner of topics and pretences were taken in aid of the main argu|ment, the avowed predominant purpo&s;e of the war was to re&s;i&s;t the propagation of <HI>principles de&s;tructive of all order and &s;ociety,</HI> and, above all things, to pre|vent then introduction into England. On this ground, the war was uniformly maintained to be what Mini&s;ters called ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;a common technical character, equally and invariably given, by all parties, to all wars of their own making. War is not to be undertaken or defended on general prin|ciples of ju&s;tice, much le&s;s of expediency. One
<PB N="8" REF="10">
nation has no juri&s;diction over another. In making war, nece&s;&s;ity, and nothing el&s;e, con&s;titutes ju&s;tice. The opprobrious language, with which this policy was enforced, is neither po&s;&s;ible to be forgotten, nor very likely to be forgiven, by the French. Even to this hour it is not abandoned. In the &s;peeches of the King's principal Mini&s;ters, and of all their adherents, the French Government, under every change it has experienced, was and is a collection of robbers, traitors, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, incapable of main|taining the relations of peace and amity with their neighbours, and therefore properly the objects of vengeance and extermination, rather than of legiti|mate war. Such language, though it were true, would do no credit to the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e who u&s;e it. A prudent Mini&s;ter, a &s;tate&s;man, with any ex|perience of the uncertainty of human affairs, &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed the po&s;&s;ibility of a rever&s;e, and not have &s;hut the door again&s;t future reconciliation. Neither is it honourable, or even &s;afe, for a great nation, to treat at all with impious robbers, parri|cides, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. But, while Mini&s;ters gave way to this imprudent pa&s;&s;ion, and indulged them&s;elves in &s;uch ra&s;h and u&s;ele&s;s invectives, is it quite clear that they were in earne&s;t? Did they then, do they now, believe that the &s;ame Government, to which they have repeatedly offered a project of <Q>perpetual peace, of &s;incere and con&s;tant friend&s;hip, of reci|procal amity and intercour&s;e,</Q> was nothing but a faithle&s;s band of traitors and murderers? Has there been any change in the principles of the&s;e people? Is it true that they have a&s;ked pardon of God and man for their manifold offences? If not, why are their principles le&s;s dangerous <HI>now,</HI> when they are crowned and confirmed by &s;ucce&s;s, when even we acknowledge that they have at la&s;t produced a Government fit for the King of Great Britain to treat with, than they were in 1793? The parties
<PB N="9" REF="11">
and the principles were the &s;ame. Lord Malme&s;bury was not in&s;tructed to object to the one, or to prote&s;t again&s;t the other. Both the negotiations broke off on que&s;tions of profit and lo&s;s, not on principles. In all the di&s;patches of the two emba&s;&s;ies, there is not a &s;ingle word about morality or religion, nor even of that obnoxious doctrine which was to occa&s;ion re|volt and di&s;order in every country. If the French would have relinqui&s;hed Flanders in 1796, or the Cape and Ceylon in 1797, we &s;hould have he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rd no more of their morals or their crimes. By offering to compound with &s;uch principles, and to unite with &s;uch parties, the Mini&s;ter confe&s;&s;es that their crimes and their principles had little or no concern in the real motives and objects of the war. In fact, it &s;oon appeared, that the purpo&s;e of the alliance was to di&s;|member France, while the Allies talked of nothing but morality and religion.</P>
<P>The la&s;t, and not the lea&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on among the charges again&s;t the French, was, that they declared war fir&s;t. With a willing audience, any non&s;en&s;e is as good as any argument. A declaration of war is not an act of aggre&s;&s;ion. It rather &s;uppo&s;es an antecedent injury received, and &s;atisfaction de|manded, and refu&s;ed. Whether well founded or not, it a&s;&s;umes the character of frankne&s;s and mag|nanimity, by announcing the ho&s;tility it intends, and putting the enemy on his defence. If our ground was good, if the war on our &s;ide was ju&s;t at any time, it was &s;o before February 1793, and our declaration &s;hould have preceded theirs. In the conduct of great affairs, the advantages of cunning are very incon&s;iderable. By provoking a challenge, or driving your opponent to break the peace, you may po&s;&s;ibly have the law on your &s;ide in a private quarrel. Between nations this is not policy, but deceit: and a poor deceit too, that deceives nobody.
<PB N="10" REF="12">
The real aggre&s;&s;or is he who refu&s;es &s;atisfaction, and forces his adver&s;ary to a&s;&s;ault him.</P>
<P>On the&s;e grounds, the King's Mini&s;ters affirmed, and continue to affirm, that the war was ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. They do not contend that the character of the French Government is improved, or that the war was le&s;s ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary in 1796 or 1797, than it was originally. Neverthele&s;s they have offered to negotiate, and, as they &s;ay, with a &s;incere intention to make peace. We are then to con&s;ider what mea|&s;ures they took to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to the negotiation, and for what o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;ons they broke it off. The validity of the &s;econd will throw a light on the &s;incerity of the fir&s;t. The propo&s;ition to be believed is, that the object, which they had mo&s;t at heart in 1796 and 1797, was to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>a &s;incere and con&s;tant friend&s;hip and a reciprocal intercour&s;e</HI> (in the terms of Lord Grenville's project) with an abandoned crew, with <HI>the &s;ame individual junto of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke's Third Letter.</NOTE>, who were and are incapable of maintaining the relations of peace and amity with any body. It would be u&s;e|le&s;s now to look back to the particulars of Lord Malme&s;bury's fir&s;t emba&s;&s;y, except to ob&s;erve that, by yielding Belgium, of which the French were in po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion, and which it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to wre&s;t out of their hands, we might have had a tolerable peace in December 1796, and &s;aved the &s;uperfluous expence and di&s;tre&s;s of two campaigns at lea&s;t, with all their po&s;&s;ible con&s;equences. The language of our Government, on that &s;ubject, is never to be forgotten. On the 17th of December 1796, Lord Malme&s;bury &s;ays to Mon&s;ieur de la Croix, <Q>I &s;hould not deal fairly with you if I he&s;itated to declare, in the <HI>out&s;et</HI> of our negotiation, that, on <HI>this</HI> point, you mu&s;t entertain no expectation that his Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="11" REF="13">
will relax, or <HI>ever</HI> con&s;ent to &s;ee the Nether|lands remain a part of France.</Q> If the Mini&s;ter's di&s;po&s;ition to peace had been &s;incere, he would not have made Belgium an in&s;urmountable objection to it. He knew the re&s;olution of the French by their po&s;itive an&s;wer to Mr. Wickham &s;ome months be|fore. He knew that, without giving up Flanders, it was in vain to negotiate, and that peace was not to be had. He knew al&s;o, or he ought to have known, that Au&s;tria would not &s;upport him in his preten&s;ion to carry this point. In December 1796, Lord Malme&s;|bury was in&s;tructed to make the ce&s;&s;ion of Belgium an indi&s;pen&s;able condition of any treaty with France. In April the preliminaries were &s;igned at Leoben, and Belgium relinqui&s;hed by the Emperor. For this pre|tended object, however, Mr. Pitt continues the war, and then <HI>he</HI> al&s;o gives it up with all po&s;&s;ible indif|ference. How is any principle or profe&s;&s;ion of Go|vernment to be depended on, when, after &s;o &s;olemn a declaration in the King's name, we &s;ee another ne|gotiation &s;olicited in le&s;s than &s;ix months, and not a word &s;aid of this famous <HI>&s;ine qu&acirc; non,</HI> from which his Maje&s;ty would <HI>never</HI> relax? The intervening paci|fication, between France and the Emperor, will not account for &s;o rapid a change in the fundamental &s;y&s;|tem profe&s;&s;ed by our Cabinet. The que&s;tion was, whether Belgium &s;hould remain a part of France, not whether it &s;hould be re&s;tored to the Emperor. By their peace with him the French acquired a great ac|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, as well as liberty of action; and the political objection, on our &s;ide, to leaving Belgium in their hands, was infinitely &s;tronger, after that peace than before it. Nece&s;&s;ity may be pleaded to ju&s;tify any thing; but where was the wi&s;dom or nece&s;&s;ity of committing his Maje&s;ty's honour by &s;uch a peremp|tory declaration? A wi&s;e Mini&s;ter takes his ground deliberately, and then he maintains it firmly.</P>
<P>On the 30th of December 1796, Mr. Pitt in|formed
<PB N="12" REF="14">
the Hou&s;e of Commons that the King's Amba&s;&s;ador had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>with every mark of ignominy and in&s;ult; that a &s;tudied in&s;ult,</HI> refined and matured by the French Directory, had been offered to his Britannic Maje&s;ty; and then he a&s;ked whether, <Q>after the King's Mini&s;ter had been ordered, in the mo&s;t in&s;ulting manner, to leave the terri|tories of France, after our propo&s;itions had been &s;lighted, and our Amba&s;&s;ador in&s;ulted, were we, by &s;ending couriers to Paris, to pro&s;trate our|&s;elves at the feet of a &s;tubborn and &s;upercilious Government, to do what they require, and to &s;ubmit to whatever they may impo&s;e? I hope there is not a hand in his Maje&s;ty's councils which would &s;ign the propo&s;al; that there is not a heart in this Hou&s;e, who would &s;anction the mea&s;ure; and that there is not an individual in the Briti&s;h dominions, who would act as the courier.</Q> Such language, whether true or not, may &s;erve to inflame a popular a&s;&s;embly, but is not prudent or ju&s;tifiable in a Mini&s;ter of State. How can he adhere to it without perpetual war? How can he retract it without everla&s;ting infamy? The French made no apology. They offered no repa|ration. Yet, in le&s;s than &s;ix months, when the Mini&s;ter him&s;elf had &s;o degraded the office that no gentleman ought to have accepted it, the &s;ame hand was found to &s;ign, the &s;ame heart to &s;anction, and the &s;ame courier to carry the me&s;&s;age, exactly to the &s;ame parties. Whether this mi&s;erable &s;tep in|dicated any thing but a &s;udden panic, mu&s;t be de|termined by the circum&s;tances that preceded, and the conduct that followed it. The hearts of men are not &s;o ea&s;ily changed. The French peace with the Empero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, the in&s;olvency of the Bank, and the mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">inies in the Fleet, were enough to frighten Mi|ni&s;ters, as they did the nation. But fear is not the parent of honour and &s;incerity. Without opening
<PB N="13" REF="15">
the negotiation again, Mr. Pitt could not have kept his place. Now a mere offer to put an end to ho&s;|tilities, while all the cau&s;es and all the effects of a rooted hatred remain, can impo&s;e on no man. There mu&s;t be a real di&s;po&s;ition to peace, and this mu&s;t be manife&s;ted by a temperate, if not amicable language, and by all the acts of kindne&s;s and conciliation, which a &s;tate of war will admit of; otherwi&s;e the forms of a negotiation avail nothing. Prudent and temperate proceedings, not ha&s;ty &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, pre|pare the way and di&s;po&s;e the minds of ho&s;tile powers to treat with moderation and good faith. On any other footing, a mere pacification, if it could be ob|tained, would be nothing but a malignant truce, in which the ho&s;tile mind would remain, and the pre|paration for ho&s;tility continue. If, while you offer peace in terms, your actions and di&s;cour&s;es indicate nothing but &s;u&s;picion, hatred, and revenge, you may po&s;&s;ibly purcha&s;e a ce&s;&s;ation of arms by conce&s;&s;ions and &s;acrifices; but you leave the enmity entire, and &s;trengthen it again&s;t you by the price you pay for a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of its effects. To make peace without friend&s;hip, unle&s;s you could dictate the terms in&s;tead of receiving them, is not merely u&s;ele&s;s, but extremely dangerous; e&s;pecially with an enemy, who owe you nothing but hatred, who know that you aim at their utter de&s;truction, and who never can believe that the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try can be in earne&s;t in their pacific profe&s;&s;ions, unle&s;s they are the fal&s;e&s;t and vile&s;t of mankind, or unle&s;s they are reduced to the la&s;t extremity. While the negoti|ation la&s;ted, invectives and abu&s;e again&s;t the French Directory went on as u&s;ual, or with very lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">le in|terruption, in the new&s;papers paid and in&s;tructed by our Government. Every man in London knows that the&s;e papers &s;peak the language of Mini&s;ters, and that they are kept in con&s;tant pay, on purpo&s;e to prepare the public to adopt the &s;entiments and
<PB N="14" REF="16">
views of Government. The French know it as well as we do; and this knowledge governs their opinion of our &s;incerity much more than the formal declarations and diplomatic phra&s;es in u&s;e among Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>The &s;econd appointment of Lord Malme&s;bury, in him&s;elf unexceptionable, was not calculated to in|&s;pire the French with confidence, or to conciliate their good will. With or without a rea&s;on, they &s;u&s;pected and di&s;tru&s;ted him. The Directory &s;aid, that <Q>another choice would have augured more fa|vourably for the &s;peedy conclu&s;ion of a peace.</Q> Lord Grenville &s;aid, <Q>that this remark of the Di|rectory was certainly not of a nature to require any an&s;wer.</Q> The &s;trict right of our Government to choo&s;e their Amba&s;&s;ador is not denied, nor was it di&s;|puted by the French. But, in human dealing, &s;trict right is very often more offen&s;ive than injury, becau&s;e it furni&s;hes no regular cau&s;e of complaint, e&s;pecially if it be of no real or important u&s;e to the party that a&s;&s;erts it; and &s;till more, if it be har&s;hly or &s;uper|ciliou&s;ly maintained.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tify the Mini&s;ter in breaking off the negoti|ation, he is bound to prove, not only that the de|mands of the French were unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable, for &s;uch they might be in articles of no con&s;equence, but that they could not be granted without &s;uch danger, as exceeded the ri&s;k, and outweighed the con&s;equences of continuing the war.</P>
<P N="1">1. The French Plenipotentiaries objected to the title of <HI>King of France</HI> a&s;&s;umed by His Maje&s;ty. They &s;aid it was e&s;&s;ential to the full acknowledge|ment of their <HI>Republic,</HI> that this regal title &s;hould not exi&s;t any where. Lord Malme&s;bury <HI>endeavoured</HI> to make <HI>them feel,</HI> but without &s;ucce&s;s, <HI>that it was cavil|ling for a mere word!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Their &s;econd demand was for a re&s;titution of the &s;hips taken and de&s;troyed at Toulon, or an equi|valent
<PB N="15" REF="17">
for them. No &s;ubject was more talked of in England, or more likely to be introduced, if not in|&s;i&s;ted on by the French. Yet Lord Malme&s;bury &s;aid <HI>it came upon him unexpectedly.</HI> The argument of the French &s;tands thus: <Q>Lord Hood was admitted into Toulon, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hips, &amp;c. on the following condition, viz. that, when peace &s;hall be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in France, the &s;hips and forts, which &s;hall have been put into the hands of the Engli&s;h, &s;hall be re&s;tored to the <HI>French nation,</HI> in the &s;ame &s;tate they were in, when the inventory was delivered. By treating with the Republic, you acknowledge the exi&s;tence of a competent government, to which every re&s;titution, due to the French nation, ought to be made. Yon cannot pretend that you hold the &s;hips taken at Toulon as a depo&s;it in tru&s;t for Louis XVIII. when, by making a perpetual peace with the Republic, you are your&s;elves parties to an act which annihilates the preten&s;ions of that per&s;on. Neither could even <HI>he</HI> have any claim to the re&s;titution, unle&s;s he were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Throne. Ships of war, magazines, &amp;c. are national property, not within the per&s;onal owner&s;hip of princes, much le&s;s removable with their per&s;ons. They are the fixtures of the State, which even the Sovereign in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion cannot alienate from the defence or &s;ervice of the country. We demand the re&s;titu|tion as repre&s;entatives of the French nation, which you acknowledge us to be, and preci&s;ely in the terms of your own engagement.</Q> Lord Malme&s;|bury, without attempting to an&s;wer the argument, rejects the claim. He &s;ays <Q>it was <HI>&s;o perfectly un|looked for,</HI> that it was <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for him to be pro|vided for it in his in&s;tructions, and that they could not have devi&s;ed a &s;tep more likely to de|feat the great end of his mi&s;&s;ion.</Q> Lord Gren|ville &s;ays, that the&s;e demands were received here
<PB N="16" REF="18">
<HI>with great &s;urpri&s;e.</HI> Now does any man believe that they were &s;o entirely unexpected, or is it any an|&s;wer to an argument to &s;ay, that you are extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at it? In His Maje&s;ty's declaration of the 25th of October, the&s;e demands are called <HI>frivolous and offen&s;ive, without any &s;olid advantages to France.</HI> It is nor quite clear that the objection to His Majesty's re|taining the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tle of King of their country, is on <HI>their</HI> part, <HI>a mere cavil about a word,</HI> whatever it may be on ours. But that the recovery of their &s;hips &s;hould not be a &s;olid advantage to them is, to &s;ay the lea&s;t of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n extravagant propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, were not the difficulties that put an end to the negotiation; it was not quire de&s;pe|rate until the French Plenipotentiaries called on Lord Malme&s;bury to declare, <Q>whether he had or had not &s;ufficient powers to treat on the principle of a general re&s;titution of every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion belonging to them and their allies, which remained in His Maje&s;ty's hands.</Q> This demand was accompa|nied with a &s;pecific explanation, which cannot fairly be &s;eparated from it, viz. <Q>That an inquiry into the nature of the di&s;cretionary authority confided in a Mini&s;ter by no means implied an intention of requiring him to act up to it, to its utmo&s;t limits.</Q> The demand and the explanation mu&s;t be taken together, and con&s;idered as one propo&s;i|tion. To any other Amba&s;&s;ador, the French pro|bably would not have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to put &s;uch a que&s;tion. They had not forgotten that, in his former emba&s;&s;y, <HI>at every communication, he was in want of the advice of his Court</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Delacroix, December 19, 1796.</NOTE>. Whether this was their motive or not, it is evident that, if they had meant by this &s;tep to put an end to the nego|tiation, they would have in&s;i&s;ted on the que&s;tion &s;imply, without the explanation. Lord Malme&s;bury
<PB N="17" REF="19">
&s;ays, that <Q>their que&s;tion went not <HI>to the extent of his full powers,</HI> but to require of him to declare the nature of his in&s;tructions.</Q> In the fir&s;t place, he an&s;wers their que&s;tion in a &s;en&s;e materi|ally different from that which they attached to it; he then affirms, that the extent of his powers, and the nature of his in&s;tructions, are one and the &s;ame thing. But for this he a&s;&s;igns no rea&s;on; nor does he at all &s;pecify or intimate what the inconvenience or di&s;advantage would have been, if he had given them a direct an&s;wer in the affirmative, which he might have done in the terms of Lord Grenville's official note of the 17th of June, viz. <Q>That his full powers included <HI>every</HI> ca&s;e, and gave him the <HI>mo&s;t unlimited authority</HI> to conclude <HI>any</HI> articles, trea|ties,</Q> &amp;c., or in the very terms of their own de|mand, under&s;tood according to the explanation with which it was accompanied. They knew as well as he, that, in the exerci&s;e and application of his powers, he mu&s;t be governed by his in&s;tructions, and that he might be as effectually re&s;trained, by his in&s;tructions, from making particular re&s;titutions, as he could be by any limitation in his powers. If he had &s;aid <HI>Yes,</HI> the negotiation mu&s;t have proceeded, and po&s;&s;ibly might have ended with &s;ucce&s;s. What were the avowed objects that &s;tood in the way of it? The Cape and Ceylon. In our declaration of the 25th of October 1797, it is a&s;&s;erted, <Q>that France has in&s;i&s;ted that His Maje&s;ty &s;hould give up, without compen&s;ation, and into the hands of his <HI>enemies,</HI> the nece&s;&s;ary defences of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the future &s;afeguards of his empire.</Q> Now of this Declaration the two fir&s;t articles are palpably untrue. The que&s;tion was, not whether Lord Malme&s;bury &s;hould actually con&s;ent to the re&s;titution of all our conque&s;ts, but whether he had powers to treat to that extent. Such re&s;titution is never made
<PB N="18" REF="20">
until peace is concluded; of cour&s;e it cannot be made to <HI>an enemy.</HI> The&s;e places, viz. the Cape and Ceylon, are qualified as the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary defences of His Maje&s;ty's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the future &s;afeguards of his empire.</HI> Does the Mini&s;ter mean to affirm, in the plain and direct &s;en&s;e of the Declaration, that our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in India could not be defended, that our Indian empire was not &s;afe, without the Cape and the Dutch &s;ettlements in Ceylon? The fact is, that while France and Holland had a marine &s;ufficient to cope with us in the Indian &s;eas, and while the French held a powerful e&s;tabli&s;hment in the Carna|tic, the Briti&s;h empire was not only defencible and &s;afe, but grew and increa&s;ed beyond the limits of true policy and prudence, and that its danger, if any, aro&s;e from its unbounded frontier and unma|nageable extent. How the acqui&s;ition of the Cape and Ceylon could be a &s;ecurity again&s;t that &s;ort of danger, or why our other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hould be de|fencele&s;s without them at any time, and particularly <HI>now,</HI> when the power of France and Holland is an|nihilated in India, are que&s;tions, which the writer of the Declaration has not thought fit to meddle with. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive a rational argument, by which the affirmative on either of them can be made out. But, if the a&s;&s;ertion were in any degree true, and if the&s;e acqui&s;itions were ever &s;o valuable, &s;till you mu&s;t con&s;ider the price you are to pay for them. Are they worth the co&s;t and charge of a &s;ingle campaign? Do they pay the expence of their e&s;tabli&s;hments, or any part of it? Do we really want the&s;e places for defence and &s;ecurity? Are we never to make peace without them? Or is it only a pre|tence &s;et up for the real purpo&s;e of continuing the war? The Mini&s;ter is bound to &s;tate his rea&s;ons for affirming, that the Cape and Ceylon are the nece&s;|&s;ary defences of his Maje&s;ty's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the &s;afe|guard
<PB N="19" REF="21">
of his empire; or to tell us di&s;tinctly, what he means by that declaration. A naked a&s;&s;ertion is &s;uf|ficiently an&s;wered by a contradiction.</P>
<P>If this &s;tate of the facts be true, and if the&s;e con|&s;iderations are valid, the conclu&s;ion from them may be qua&s;hed by power, or denied by prejudice, but cannot be re&s;i&s;ted in argument;&mdash;that the Mini&s;ter has voluntarily plunged the nation into this di&s;a&s;trous war, not only without ju&s;tice or nece&s;&s;ity, but with|out a provocation, and in the face of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions little &s;hort of &s;upplication; that, in offering to treat with impious regicides, robbers, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, he has abandoned what he called the moral principle of the war; that, in offering to renew the intercour&s;e be|tween England and France, con&s;idering how France i&s;t con&s;tituted, he has abandoned what he called the fundamental policy of the war; that the&s;e &s;teps were taken not &s;eriou&s;ly for their pretended object, but to an&s;wer other purpo&s;es; that, if he had been &s;incere in de&s;iring it, he might have had peace long ago on tolerable terms; that the Directory now will never make peace with him, becau&s;e they cannot tru&s;t him; and that, as long as the war is continued, they will ri&s;e in their demands. The Mini&s;ter will &s;ay that he is proud of their enmity, and that the di&s;tru&s;t of &s;uch a foe gives him an additional claim to the confidence of his country, The French object to him not becau&s;e he is ho&s;tile to them, but becau&s;e they think his conduct has been treacherous. <HI>Durante bello,</HI> he ought to be their enemy; but he ought not to offer peace with one hand, while, with the other, he foments plots and con&s;piracies to overturn their government. Admitting however the merit of this ho&s;tile character, and forgetting that, as long as it prevails on his own principles, there can be no peace with France or &s;et|tlement of Ireland, has he, after all&punc; a real claim to it? At fir&s;t he denounces immortal hatred to the French,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
to their principles, to their government, to their exi&s;tence,
<Q>Littora littoribus contraria, fluctibus, undas.</Q>
He then makes them a cordial offer of perpetual peace, &s;incere friend&s;hip, and mutual intercour&s;e. When that fails, he goes back to his enmity. He then makes them a &s;econd tender of his mo&s;t &s;incere amity; and now he reverts to his enmity again. <HI>Bellum, pax rur&s;um.</HI> He reviles and courts the &s;ame parties alternately, and Parliament vibrates with him.</P>
<P>In what condition this ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war, if ever it can be ended, will leave us at la&s;t, may ap|pear doubtful to tho&s;e, who are not &s;truck with the actual re&s;ult of it. They, who thrive by the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, are not likely to be alarmed by future dan|gers. The vermin feed, and the animal dies. In the la&s;t five years, the Mini&s;ter has wa&s;ted above two hundred millions of money borrowed, be&s;ides all the growing income of the country, and an immen&s;e ar|rear of debt anaccounted and unprovided for. He &s;et out with an a&s;&s;ociation of the principal powers of Europe, whom he paid, and of the inferior &s;tates, whom he forced to join in the confederacy; and now we have but one friend left, who, <HI>if not actually nego|tiating with France,</HI> makes no contribution to the war, and mu&s;t &s;ink, if &s;he is not &s;upported by the protection of Great Britain. Is there another power in Europe, that would not gladly promote the down|fall of England? They &s;ee us &s;tand aloof, com|manding the &s;ea, and apparently in &s;afety, encourag|ing, bribing, or bullying other nations to per&s;ecute and de&s;troy one another. On the Continent, the Eng|li&s;h Government, and not the French, with all their enormities, are con&s;idered as the original incendiaries and common enemy of mankind. The French,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
they &s;ay, plunder the hou&s;e, but the Engli&s;h &s;et it on fire.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Ireland, con&s;tituting a third of the empire, in&s;tead of contributing to the common cau&s;e, is proclaimed to be in a &s;tate of open rebel|lion, and with difficulty kept down by a great army, paid by England, which ought to have been em|ployed again&s;t France, but which is now in &s;uch a &s;tate, as <HI>to be formidable to every one, but the enemy.</HI> Specific evidence is unnece&s;&s;ary. The condition of the army is &s;ufficient to prove what the condition of the country mu&s;t be, where &s;oldiers range at large, not only without civil authority, but without di&s;ci|pline. But the groans of Ireland are too di&s;tant to be heard. Her &s;orrows are not &s;een. The dre&s;&s;es of the opera are corrected, and all the duties of Chri&s;|tianity are performed.</P>
<P>In England and Scotland the general di&s;po&s;ition of the people may be fairly judged of by the means, which are &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary to counteract it; an immen&s;e &s;tanding army, barracks in every part of the country, the Bill of Rights &s;u&s;pended, and in effect a military government.</P>
<P>Since the year 1793, the property of the public creditor has lo&s;t about half its marketable value, which the enormous increa&s;e of the ma&s;s makes it im|po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould ever recover. The whole effect of a &s;inking fund of four millions, augmented by the fall of public credit, and acting on a capital &s;o de|preciated, is to keep the 3 per cents. at a fluctuating price between 48 and 50. With that prodigious engine of financial power in his hands, the Mini&s;ter has been fearful of encountering another loan; and now he con|fe&s;&s;es, that, under the mea&s;ures of his admini&s;tration, public credit has been &s;o much impaired, that it has become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to give additional &s;up|port and &s;ecurity &s;o the national funds, by making
<PB N="22" REF="24">
the land-tax perpetual, and putting it up to auction in Change Alley.</P>
<P>A few months before payment was &s;topped at the Bank, any man, who had predicted that event, would have been pitied as a madman, or pro&s;cribed as a traitor. The Bank is identified with Government, and, with their connivance, may i&s;&s;ue its paper to any unknown amount. An act of Parliament is always ready to &s;helter them from the demands of their law|ful creditors. The only effectual &s;ecurity to the public, again&s;t an exorbitant emi&s;&s;ion of Bank paper, is to be obliged to pay in &s;pecie on demand. Take away that re&s;traint, and then what is the Bank, or what may it be, but an in&s;trument of enormous power and fraud in the hands of the Mini&s;ter?</P>
<P>The final fate of the Funds is involved not only in the in&s;tant exigencies of the war, but in the ne|ce&s;&s;ities which the war will entail on the peace. To provide for the e&s;tabli&s;hments, and to pay the intere&s;t of the debt, out of any fund, that does not invade the &s;ources of production, is palpably impo&s;&s;ible. But a nation, that &s;upplies its income out of its capital, lives on the &s;eed, and then the que&s;tion is, not whe|ther a great emergency may not demand and ju&s;tify a great exertion, but how long the ordinary &s;trength can &s;upport the extraordinary effort. The demand, that exceeds the ability, is &s;ure to le&s;&s;en it; that is, the inability increases with the demand.</P>
<P>Again&s;t an inva&s;ion, all hearts and hands mu&s;t be united; but why &s;hould the French run the ri&s;que of an attempt &s;o de&s;perate, if not impracticable, when it is plain that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y can effectually ruin us without it? <HI>Their</HI> purpo&s;e is &s;ufficiently an&s;wered by the menace; while, on this &s;ide, the alarm is encouraged as a &s;pur to contribution.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior &s;kill and courage of our officers and &s;eamen have been attended, as I tru&s;t they ever will be, with &s;ucce&s;&s;es that illu&s;trate and adorn the naval
<PB N="23" REF="25">
character of the nation. But the u&s;e and the lu&s;tre of the&s;e great events are by no means equal. Unle&s;s they are wi&s;ely applied to the purpo&s;es of peace, they may dazzle and mi&s;lead us. What mu&s;t be the re&s;pective condition of France and England, taken together, and comprehending all circum&s;tances, when &s;uch victories make no impre&s;&s;ion on the courage and determination, nor even on the prudence of the enemy, and when even the Engli&s;h are not elated by them? We are ma&s;ters of the ocean, while almo&s;t all the ports of Europe, from the Texel to Venice, are &s;hut again&s;t us. Our fleets may keep the &s;ea un|til the &s;hips are worn out, while the French pre|dominate on &s;hore, and may, if they will, engro&s;s the trade of the Continent.</P>
<P>This country is now at the utmo&s;t &s;train of all its remaining re&s;ources, not for the purpo&s;e of attempt|ing any vigorous operation again&s;t a vulnerable enemy, which, if it &s;ucceeded, might reduce them to rea&s;onable terms, but, if po&s;&s;ible, to defend the two i&s;lands again&s;t an inva&s;ion, which the enemy may continue to hold over us, with very little effort on their part, or much inconvenience to their affairs, until the nerves and &s;inews of England are broken by exertions, unavailing while they la&s;t for any pur|po&s;e of attack, and impo&s;&s;ible to be continued. With all the means of &s;ucce&s;s, and weapons of vic|tory in his hands, Mr. Pitt has made the French Republic what it is. We have it from an authority, which &s;ome men &s;hould re&s;pect, that while <HI>the armies and navies of England have been given him without re|&s;triction, and its trea&s;ures poured out at his feet, his un|pro&s;perous prudence has produced all the effects of the blinde&s;t temerity, and finally left this country nothing, but her own naked force, to oppo&s;e the imminent danger of falling under the dominion of France</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke's Third Letter, p. 19, 26, and 164.</NOTE>.</P>
