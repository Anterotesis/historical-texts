<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE <HI>HENRY BENTINCK,</HI> EARL of <HI>Portland, Vi&s;count</HI> Wood&s;tock, <HI>Baron of</HI> Cirence&s;ter, <HI>Captain of Her Maje&s;ty's Fir&s;t Troop of Guards,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WOmen, and Men like Women, natu|rally fly to the Brave for Protection. This Pretence <HI>Mar-plot</HI> and I have for Ad|dre&s;&s;ing to your LORDSHIP. We know it is the peculiar Di&s;tinction of Noble Minds, that they are ready to receive under their
<PB REF="3">
Care the Di&s;tre&s;s'd, though they have no other Merit, than that they be&s;eech their Patronage.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay this, my LORD, I wou'd not be under&s;tood to conceal, that my <HI>Play</HI> has been very kindly receiv'd; but we Wo|men overlook all Prai&s;e, but from tho&s;e Per&s;ons who&s;e Approbation we mo&s;t e&s;teem. We are apt to be carry'd away from Admi|rers to tho&s;e we Admire: And this <HI>Come|dy</HI> prefers the Honour of being thrown at Your Feet, to the Applau&s;e of an Audience. It is the Misfortune of our Sex, that we are deterr'd from the Advantages of a Learn|ed Education: But as our Expre&s;&s;ions are Artle&s;s, our Sentiments are le&s;s Di&s;guis'd. Had I, my LORD, the Skill of a Writer, I &s;hou'd here record your Noble Father's Zeal for his Royal Ma&s;ter, and celebrate that Care and Fidelity which pre&s;erv'd the Life of Our Deliverer: But, in&s;tead of men|tioning this Obligation, which my late Lord <HI>Portland</HI> laid on every Man in <HI>England,</HI> I confine my &s;elf to what we owe Him for being your Father.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">That Your LORDSHIP may long ble&s;s the World with the &s;ame Virtues which You have &s;hown in the Entrance You have made on the bu&s;ie Stage of it, and long en|joy the Advantages of an Affluent Fortune, Graceful Per&s;on, and Generous Mind, is the ardent Prayer of,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THE Men of Wit do now their Brains fatigue</L>
<L>So much with Politicks and State-Intrigue!</L>
<L>That there's not one Male-Poet of the Age</L>
<L>Will conde&s;cend to labour for the Stage.</L>
<L>Therefore our Author, tho' no <HI>Rules</HI> &s;he knows,</L>
<L>What Nature prompts, with Artle&s;s Hand be&s;tows:</L>
<L>You'll &s;ee the <HI>Subject</HI> for the <HI>Genius</HI> fit,</L>
<L>A <HI>Bu&s;ie-Body,</HI> drawn by Female Wit,</L>
<L>Still on the Hunt to know of others Wooing,</L>
<L>Eternally employ'd, and nothing doing!</L>
<L>Into dear Secrets anxiou&s;ly they pre&s;s,</L>
<L>De&s;troying, even where they wi&s;h Succe&s;s!</L>
<L>The &s;canty Age all better Fare denies,</L>
<L>And no new Characters the Town &s;upplies.</L>
<L>Some Years ago Wit had a larger Field,</L>
<L>And every Room cou'd fre&s;h Stage-Coxcombs yield;</L>
<L>But long has been all Humorous Folly cro&s;t,</L>
<L>All Fool in empty Politician's lo&s;t.</L>
<L>Scowrers, and Rakes, and Debauchees are o'er,</L>
<L>Beaux are extinct, and Bullies are no more.</L>
<L>Therefore in Scarcity of home-bred Tools,</L>
<L>Your Treat to Night's compos'd of Foreign Fools;</L>
<L>And tho' our <HI>Mar-plot</HI> has been &s;hown before,</L>
<L>The Fool may differ, on a different Shore&mdash;</L>
<L>For once, then, break old Cu&s;tom; be not o'er-nice,</L>
<L>But let the <HI>&s;elf-&s;ame</HI> Woman plea&s;e you <HI>Twice.</HI></L>

<P>WHY Brother, you are di&s;tracted; how often have you fill'd my Brain with the&s;e Chyme|ra's? Why &s;hould I murder my Wife with|out a Cau&s;e?</P>

<P>A Cau&s;e! Do's a Cuckold want a Cau&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, Senior, keep that Word Cuckold between your Teeth, till you can prove me &s;uch, or by St. <HI>Anthony</HI> you &s;hall feel what Mettle my Spado is made of. <STAGE>[Laying his Hand to his Sword.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Name your Spado again, and I'll &s;hake thee into Du&s;t, thou feeble Dotard. Your Spado! employ it again&s;t the Man that robs you of your Honour, and not again&s;t him that would pre&s;erve it. I &s;ay, My Si&s;ter, your Wife, is a Strumpet, the Strumpet of a damn'd Heretick: I &s;aw the Looks, nay the Signs, &s;he gave &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers, as &s;he came from Church this Morning.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Per.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, there's the Ble&s;&s;ing of matching into an ho|nourable Family: Now mu&s;t I bear all Affronts patiently, be|cau&s;e I'm but a Merchant, for&s;ooth&mdash;Oh, give me any Cur&s;e but this&mdash;Pray, Senior, give me leave to &s;peak one Word with you: I am convinc'd of my too much Indulgence for this very Cockatrice, and there remains nothing to quicken my Re|venge, but certain Demon&s;tration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certain Demon&s;tration! Mu&s;t you have Ocular Proof? Mu&s;t your Coward Heart be animated with the Sight? A Cur&s;e of your Equivocations&mdash;</P>

<P>No, any other Sen&s;e will &s;erve; let me hear 'em, feel 'em, nay, &s;mell 'em; and &s;ure Cuckoldom is &s;o rank a Scent, that, tho' I liv'd in <HI>England,</HI> where they &s;carce breathe any other Air, I cou'd di&s;tingui&s;h it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Part of the Cau&s;e that brought you, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? art thou in the Army?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Colonel, I leave Honour to you, Intere&s;t brought me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are Twin-Brothers, <HI>Charles</HI>; if Intere&s;t did not drive, Honour wou'd come &s;lowly on: Art thou turn'd Mer|chant then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith, not I; but it pleas'd Heav'n to take my Wife's Father out of the way, who left me Executor, and his Concerns here oblig'd me to take this Voyage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, old Sir, jealous Traffick is dead at la&s;t. How long do you intend to &s;tay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Longer than I expected when I embark'd: I came away in &s;uch a Hurry, the Ship &s;ailing &s;ooner than I thought &s;he
<PB N="3" REF="9">
wou'd, I forgot to put up &s;ome Papers, without which I can't adju&s;t my Accounts with &s;ome Merchants here; I have writ to my Wife to &s;end them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very unlucky; prithee, how do&s;t thou &s;pend thy Time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why very in&s;ipidly: How do you pa&s;s yours? What Company have you here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>All &s;orts; the Women, I'll &s;ay that for 'em, are kind enough, and won't put you to the Expence of Swearing and Lying to gain them; but a Man is as &s;afe in an Engagement, as in their Arms; Fortune is the kind Friend in both the On|&s;ets: But I have got acquainted in a <HI>French</HI> Family, which are not altogether &s;o dangerous one way, but much more &s;o ano|ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! how's that, Colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'm fearful of dwindling into an honourable A|mour there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exert your Gallantry, gain your Point once, and tho&s;e Fears will vani&s;h. The <HI>French</HI> Ladies are ea&s;ie of Acce&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, the <HI>French</HI> Gayety re&s;embles the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Com|plai&s;ance, yet they have always a Re&s;erve to da&s;h your Ex|pectations, and when you think your &s;elf in a manner Ma&s;ter of their Cover'd-way, they &s;pring a Mine of Coquetry, and blow you up at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you &s;o, Colonel? Why then give me the <HI>Lisbon</HI> Dames, that &s;urrender to the Bold and Brave: He de&s;erves not a Woman, that would not run &s;ome Hazard, provided &s;he be kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some are of Opinion, that the jilting Fair gives the &s;ure&s;t Blow, and <HI>Sucklin</HI> &s;ays, <HI>'Tis Expectation makes the Ble&s;&s;ing dear.</HI> This <HI>French</HI> Woman has found the way to unite my jarring Inclinations, and tune 'em to the pitch of Con&s;tancy, and I am very apprehen&s;ive of becoming that tame Mon&s;ter, call'd a Husband. Ah! I find I am caught, for I can name that terrible Word without &s;tarting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! I &s;hall have you in my Cla&s;s: Sure the La|dy that can make &s;uch an entire Conque&s;t over your Heart mu&s;t be a Per&s;on of extraordinary Parts, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, faith, her Lady&s;hip has very extraordinary Parts; &s;he's airy to Affectation, and changeable as the Wind: She has
<PB N="4" REF="10">
Tongue enough for a Lawyer, but as hard to be under&s;tood as an Apothecary: She begins as many Stories as a Romance, and ends them as intricately, or, to &s;peak more properly, &s;eldom ends them at all: She's as whim&s;ical as a Projector, as ob&s;tinate as a Phy&s;ician, and as faithful as the Monarch of her Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admirable Qualities for a Wife; and can you for&s;ake the whole Sex for this Woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph! that I won't &s;wear; but I find I can't for&s;ake her for the whole Sex: To be plain with you, I have try'd the Strength of Variety, and at this time am in pro&s;pect of the Fa|vour from as fine a Woman as any in <HI>Lisbon</HI>; yet this Medly of Womankind triumphs over all, and in the mid&s;t of my Rap|tures I murmur <HI>Joneton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>But may I not &s;ee this wondrous Engineer, who can countermine her whole Sex, and blow up the Magazine of your Affections, Colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall, but you mu&s;t give me your Honour not to rival me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>The De&s;cription you have given, Colonel, &s;ecures you from that Fear; be&s;ides, you know I am marry'd, neither am I de&s;titute of a Mi&s;tre&s;s, tho' in a &s;trange Place. I this Morning was a a&s;&s;ur'd, by a Sign from a Lady's Hankerchief, that my Wants &s;hou'd be &s;upply'd upon Occa&s;ion. I did not rightly under&s;tand her, till the good old <HI>Duena</HI> explain'd her Mean|ing; and this Night I &s;hall be happy in her Arms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a Stranger to the&s;e Affairs <HI>Charles,</HI> take heed, proceed with caution, for the Women here are as warm in their Revenge as in their Inclinations, bare Su&s;picion ju&s;tifies Murder; if you manage your Intreague &s;o clo&s;ely to e&s;cape the Husband and Relations, 'tis odds but your Mi&s;tre&s;s finds &s;ome pretence to employ her Bravoes, Fellows that will di&s;patch a dozen Men for a <HI>Moydre.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I go well arm'd, under&s;tand the Language, and will not ea&s;ily fall a Victime, but re&s;olve to &s;ee the event of this In|treague; the old Matron told me that the Lady was young and beautiful, her Husband a Merchant, rich, covetous, old, and ugly; that &s;he hated him wor&s;e than Penance, and lov'd me bet|ter than her Prayers; &s;hall I be &s;uch a Poultroon to decline a Lady's Summons? No, for the honour of <HI>Britain,</HI> it &s;hall never be &s;aid an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> fled either from the Wars of <HI>Mars,</HI> or
<PB N="5" REF="11">
<HI>Venus</HI>; let her bring me on, if I di&s;charge not my &s;elf with Honour, and make my Retreat &s;ecure, may I forfeit the Embraces of the Sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well &s;aid <HI>Charles,</HI> in my Con&s;cience you married Men encroach too much upon our Prerogative methinks; you who purcha&s;e plea&s;ure by way of Annuity, &s;hould leave us Batchel|lours the liberty of the Freehold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Ground we cour&s;e in, is never the wor&s;e for your U&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, 'tis &s;ometimes the better; there's many a Wife lies Fallow, and many a good E&s;tate wou'd want an Heir, if it were not for us young Fellows, e&s;pecially Soldiers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you ought to make Provi&s;ion for the Recruits you rai&s;e, as much as for your Widows, they are far more Nu|merous.</P>
<STAGE>[A noi&s;e of cla&s;hing of Swords, and Murder cry'd within.</STAGE>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rav.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what? Why you took the only method in the World to have your Guts let out: Ha, ha! watch a Woman in <HI>Lisbon</HI>! Hark you young Gentleman, &s;uppre&s;s that natural Curio&s;ity of diving into other Peoples Affairs, or never hope to &s;ee old <HI>Eng|land</HI> again.</P>
