<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. HARLEY.</STAGE>
<L>LONG has been &s;erv'd from this our motley Stage,</L>
<L>Repa&s;ts for various ta&s;tes&mdash;from youth to age&mdash;</L>
<L>To lively Mi&s;s, e&s;cap'd from S&s;hool and toil,</L>
<L>Our &s;ports have oft be&s;tow'd the infant &s;mile,</L>
<L>While the rude boy, from We&s;tmin&s;ter or Eton,</L>
<L>Who <HI>"&s;pies,"</HI> and <HI>"quizzes"</HI> one, where'er they meet one.</L>
<L>For them, our brilliant Ballets drawn from Greece,</L>
<L>Re&s;tore their Greek&mdash;without a rod a piece.</L>
<L>While tricks and tumbling hone&s;t John employ,</L>
<L>Who drinks his punch aloft, and &s;creams with joy.</L>
<L>The wife is all for mu&s;ic, &s;hakes and thrilling,</L>
<L>Old maids, from &s;oft humanity, love killing:</L>
<L>Each has his ta&s;te: for married life may &s;ay,</L>
<L>Not oft' two per&s;ons think in the &s;ame way.</L>
<L>Our Bard, long known to you, this night makes up,</L>
<L>Of various beverage&mdash;a kind of <HI>cup;</HI></L>
<L>Of Mu&s;ic, Pantomime, and graver &s;cenes,</L>
<L>Perhaps a da&s;h of terror intervenes;</L>
<L>Should not all the&s;e &s;ufficient change &s;upply,</L>
<L>If you condemn&mdash;there will be&mdash;<HI>Tragedy.</HI></L>
<L>But, Britons, while a neighbouring nation's crimes,</L>
<L>Have &s;pread war wide, and made the&s;e&mdash;"Iron Times."</L>
<L>Greet <HI>you,</HI> the moral virtues of <HI>the STAGE,</HI></L>
<L>Which haply may amend an erring age:</L>
<L>That Arts and Sciences may take their place,</L>
<L>That the dome&s;tic ties may have their grace,</L>
<L>The rights of &s;weet humanity be known,</L>
<L>And freedom fixed by law, reign like your own?</L>

<P>&mdash;Holloa! Dam&s;els! Stop a little, and I'll ea&s;e you of your wares, I'll warrant you. Well, thank Heaven, we're arrived in a chearful country at la&s;t. <STAGE>looking about</STAGE> Ble&s;s me! What a charming air! And what a charming appetite it gives one! I have &s;carcely &s;wallowed any thing but du&s;t for the&s;e three weeks, but here ends our tedious journey&mdash;Yonder is the city of Me&s;&s;ina, and hard by re&s;ides the man my ma&s;ter is in &s;earch of&mdash;Why my ma&s;ter has left Savoy, to &s;eek this interview with poor dead Julia's jealous hu&s;band, I am yet to learn&mdash;Oh! Here he comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>CARLOS.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;At length, Valoury, the hurry of travelling is over&mdash;you now will have time to re|cover your fatigue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Signor Carlos, and to lo&s;e my appetite I hope; for the one is as irk&s;ome a com|panion as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would my di&s;tre&s;tes could be as ea&s;ily removed as yours&mdash;The &s;hade of my departed Julia haunts me at every turn, and her injured memory calls aloud for vengeance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Sir, if grief or re&s;entment could re&s;tore her to life, I'd &s;tarve my&s;elf into a pa&s;&s;ion with plea&s;ure; but as that is impo&s;&s;ible, might I advi&s;e you, Signor, I &s;hould recommend a tem|perate meal or two, before we proceed any fur|ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Temperate! Valoury, can angui&s;h in|&s;upportable be temperate! Li&s;ten to the &s;tory of my heart&mdash;That Julia, the haple&s;s wife of the im|perious Count Montoni, whom thou &s;aw'&s;t interr'd at Palermo&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a melancholy &s;ight it was, Sig|nor Carlos&mdash;I remember I was ju&s;t &s;itting down to an excellent barbacue, &s;moking hot, when the proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed the window; but &s;o it is, when|ever a man is upon the point of being happy, &s;ome cur&s;ed thing or other always interferes to chill his pro&s;pects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think, Valoury, of an attachment begun almo&s;t in childhood, and improved with growing years; when love's &s;oft wi&s;hes were &s;anc|tioned by rea&s;on, and dear expectation nouri&s;hed by con&s;enting friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then was the cau&s;e of your lo&s;|ing her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her father's avarice and ambition. This proud, indignant Lord, the Count Montoni, with large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and extended power, was
<PB N="8" REF="9">
captivated with my Julia's blooming charms, and, do I live to repeat it, tore her from me in the mo|ment when &s;he was to have been mine for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came the Lady to con&s;ent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>There thou ha&s;t touched the cord of angui&s;h in my brea&s;t; <HI>that</HI> drove me from my native home, to &s;eek in &s;olitude a calm, which, alas, Valoury, thy ma&s;ter's heart can never more experience; <HI>that</HI> brings me back again on the wings of rage, and vengeance, to demand atone|ment for wrongs too great to be endured.</P>
<STAGE>With great energy.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ble&s;s me, Sir! Has any thing hap|pened lately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; from the amiable Con&s;tantia, the only &s;urviving &s;i&s;ter of my haple&s;s love, I learn by papers found &s;ince her decea&s;e, that the mo&s;t infernal arts were put in practice by the Count and his adherents, to bend the timid fair one to their cruel purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on me! My hair &s;tands on end. They hinted too at Palermo, that the Lady's death was &s;udden and extraordinary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>By ba&s;e&s;t forgery &s;he was induced to believe I had already been wedded to another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>To another indeed! As if Gentlemen of your prudent turn of mind, did not think one wife at a time quite &s;ufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the hour of retribution is at hand; meanwhile bear this letter to Con&s;tantia&mdash;Her father, old Fractio&s;o, is one of the Chief Magi|&s;trates in the city. I would on no account that he &s;hould hear of my return; therefore be careful to deliver it into her own hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tru&s;t it to me, Signor, and Dad &s;hall know no more of the bu&s;ine&s;s, than an Ex-Mini|&s;ter does of the Cabinet, or a fa&s;hionable hu&s;band of his wife's bed-chamber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Carlos.</SPEAKER>
<P>From her you may learn tidings of my friend, Hilario, who&s;e return from Germany I ex|pect about this time; and I know, notwith&s;tand|ing her father's ob&s;tinate prohibition, Con&s;tantia is not in&s;en&s;ible to his de&s;erts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a charming Gentleman he is; would he were here&mdash;his chearfulne&s;s would drive away your honour's melancholy&mdash;&s;orrow with him, is like a bad Signet, it &s;queezes the &s;urface; but leaves no impre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valoury.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the Hotel&mdash;ah! Sir, you need not doubt my expedition; for &s;ure no love &s;ick girl in Europe can be more &s;harp &s;et than is your honor's very hungry, humble &s;ervant.</P>

<P>Your levity, Count Montoni, is con|temptible, and your in&s;inuation ungenerous as unju&s;t&mdash;did I not, &s;oon as I heard the gentle maid had yielded to your &s;olicitation, and, as I then thought, from worldly motives, abandoned the heart &s;he once had deigned to prize; did I not tear my&s;elf from my friends, my family, my home, quit the fond &s;cenes where I had been &s;o ble&s;t, and with a bo&s;om bleeding at every pore, leave you to the uninterrupted enjoyment of your nuptial happine&s;s?</P>
