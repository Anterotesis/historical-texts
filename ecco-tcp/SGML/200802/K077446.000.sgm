<P>THE few following quotations, from ancient authors, are here thrown together, in order to &s;upport and explain &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ages in the Drama, that re&s;pect the manners of the Druids; and which, the general account of their cu&s;toms, to be found in our hi&s;tories of Britain, does not include.</P>

<P>In the minute de&s;cription which Pliny gives us of the ceremony of gathering the mi&s;letoe, he tells us, they &s;acrificed two white bulls.

<L>And with an ax of gold, from that Jove-&s;acred tree</L>
<L>The mi&s;letoe cut down; then with a bended knee</L>

<P>There are remains of this &s;uper&s;tition &s;till, both in the north and we&s;t parts of our i&s;land. For Lhwyd, the author of the Ar|cheologia, writes thus to Rowland; &s;ee Mona Antiqua, p. 338. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Druid doctrine about the <HI>Glain Neidr,</HI> obtains very much thro' all Scotland, as well lowlands as highlands; but there is not a word of it in this kingdom (Ireland); where, as there are no &s;nakes, they could not propagate it. Be&s;ides &s;nake-&s;tones, the highlanders have their &s;nail-&s;tones, paddock-&s;tones, &amp;c. to all which they attribute their &s;everal virtues, and wear them as amu|lets."</Q> And in another letter he writes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Corni&s;h retain variety of charms, and have &s;till, towards the land's-end, the amulet of Maen Magal, and Glain Neidr, which latter they call a Mil|preu, or Melpreu, and have a charm for the &s;nake to make it, when they have found one a&s;leep, and &s;truck a hazel wand in the centre of her &s;pires."</Q></P>

The few and imperfect accounts antiquity gives us of ceremo|nies, &amp;c. which are unque&s;tionably Druidical, makes it nece&s;&s;ary in this, and in other places of the Drama, to have recour&s;e to Tacitus's account of the Germans, among&s;t whom, if there were really no e&s;tabli&s;hed Druids, there was certainly a great corre|&s;pondency, in religious opinions, with the Gauls and Britons. The pa&s;&s;age here alluded to is taken from his 10th chapter. Proprium gentis, equorumque quoque prae&s;agia ac monitus experiri. Pub|lice aluntur ii&s;dem nemoribus ac lucis, candidi &amp; nullo mortali opere contacti, quos pre&s;&s;os &s;acro curru, &s;acerdos ac rex, vel prin|ceps civitatis comitantur, hinnitus &amp; fremitus ob&s;ervant, nec ulli au&s;picio major &s;ides non &s;olum apud plebem, &s;ed apud proceres, apud &s;acerdotes.</P>
