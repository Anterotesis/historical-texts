<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath for a con&s;iderable time been the reproach of Scotland, that her in|habitants have been de&s;titute of public &s;pirit, and have felt them&s;elves merely as a number of individuals, to whom no mea&s;ure of &s;tate was of any con&s;equence, unle&s;s &s;o far as it affected their private intere&s;ts. The reign of his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty has been troubled with a &s;eries of faction, hurtful to government at home, and ruinous to the Briti&s;h power abroad: But all the while Scotland has remained in cold indifference; and each admini&s;tration, of whatever principles, has been &s;ure of our acquie&s;cence at
<PB N="4" REF="4">
lea&s;t, if not of our &s;upport, as a matter of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The flagrant inju&s;tice of the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the ca&s;e of the Middle|&s;ex election, by which a precedent was e&s;tabli&s;hed for violating the valuable pri|vilege of all the electors of Great Britain, was no more regarded in Scotland than any ordinary vote in that Hou&s;e. It has &s;ince been re&s;cinded, not indeed by the &s;ame Parliament, but by almo&s;t the &s;ame members: So that it may be &s;aid with|out offence, that the Hou&s;e of Commons is at no time infallible.</P>
<P>The claim of the Briti&s;h Parliament to tax the American colonies, or, in other words, that his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in Great Britain &s;hould command the pro|perty of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in Ame|rica, was almo&s;t univer&s;ally approved of in Scotland, where due con&s;ideration was had of the advantage of rai&s;ing regi|ments. I was one of the few who, as far as my voice could go, ventured to oppo&s;e it, both as unju&s;t and inexpedient:&mdash;Un|ju&s;t,
<PB N="5" REF="5">
becau&s;e I thought the people of A|merica, as participant of the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution, &s;hould no more be taxed with|out the con&s;ent of their repre&s;entatives, than the people of Ireland, or the people of Great Britain:&mdash;Inexpedient, becau&s;e I did not think it po&s;&s;ible for this coun|try to prevail, unle&s;s one of two propo|&s;itions, utterly improbable, but indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly circulated, were true: The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that a whole people were cowards; the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> that a whole people were willing that their all &s;hould be at the unconditional mercy of another people. My intimacy with the excellent and much honoured General Oglethorpe, who him&s;elf &s;ettled one of the American colonies, and &s;till lives with all his faculties and all his be|nevolence in full vigour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Oglethorpe, now the Father of the Briti&s;h army, being the olde&s;t General, but without emolument, &s;ettled the Colony of Georgia. Pope thus celebrates him.
<Q><L>"Or driven by &s;trong benevolence of &s;oul,</L>
<L>"Will fly like Oglethorpe from pole to pole."</L></Q></NOTE>, confirmed me
<PB N="6" REF="6">
in my opinion; and when pleading at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons, in a que&s;tion concerning taxation, I a|vowed that opinion, declaring that the man in the world for whom I have the highe&s;t re&s;pect<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr John&s;on.</NOTE>, had not been able to convince me that <HI>Taxation</HI> was <HI>no Tyran|ny.</HI> My principles being of a Tory ca&s;t, that is to &s;ay, tho&s;e of a &s;teady Royali&s;t, it grieved me to the heart, that our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign &s;hould be advi&s;ed by evil coun&s;ellors to a&s;&s;ent to &s;evere mea|&s;ures again&s;t an immen&s;e body of his &s;ubjects, who were willing faithfully to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the King as &s;u|preme,&mdash;to the father of all his people;&mdash;but not to his &s;ubjects, their brethren, with whom they were entitled to equal privileges.</P>
<P>It appeared to me, that <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> car|ried on the war again&s;t our colonies, chiefly in the hope that if they &s;hould be &s;ubdued, a multitude of offices might
<PB N="7" REF="7">
be created, the di&s;po&s;al of which would ab&s;olutely &s;ecure a majority in Parlia|ment upon every occa&s;ion; and for that rea&s;on, had there been no other, every friend to rational freedom mu&s;t have abhorred the de&s;ign. The &s;lavery &s;pread over the continent of America, would have reverberated upon Britain. The right of the people to &s;upply or to with|hold money, is the great check upon the executive power; and in <HI>that</HI> con&s;i&s;ts the chief excellence of our free government.</P>
<P>A &s;trong party in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, oppo&s;ed that baleful admini&s;tra|tion which per&s;evered in the Ameri|can war, and oppo&s;ed it with &s;uch vio|lence, as at length to obtain a vote in the Hou&s;e of Commons, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the in|fluence of the Crown has increa&s;ed, is increa&s;ing, and ought to be dimini&s;h|ed;"</Q> the truth of which vote, in this democratical reign, I leave to the con&s;i|deration of every candid man.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="8">
I would wi&s;h, in all que&s;tions of na|tional concern, not to regard men, but mea&s;ures; and therefore, I &s;hall make no remarks upon that extraordinary fluc|tuation of Mini&s;ters whom we have &s;ince &s;een, like the vi&s;ions of Macbeth:
<Q><L>"Come like &s;hadows, &s;o depart."</L></Q></P>
<P>But I earne&s;tly entreat the attention of my countrymen, to the alarming attempt which has been recently made, to de|&s;troy the &s;ecurity of private property, and annihilate the con&s;titutional mo|narchy of the&s;e kingdoms, under the pretext of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"better regulating the affairs of the Ea&s;t-India Company."</Q></P>
<P>Har&s;h and abu&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions can do no good, and are very foreign from the intention of this Letter, which is not to kindle a wild rage, but to rou&s;e a &s;teady &s;pirit. I &s;hall therefore ab&s;tain from u&s;ing tho&s;e epithets which have, with ju&s;tice, been applied to the bill for ve&s;t|ing the affairs of the Ea&s;t-India Com|pany in certain Commi&s;&s;ioners. But I
<PB N="9" REF="9">
will &s;ay, that I look upon this bill as the mo&s;t dangerous mea&s;ure to the country that ever yet was hazarded in Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall con&s;ider it in both the views which I have mentioned, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> As affect|ing property; and, 2<HI>dly,</HI> As affecting the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> As to <HI>Property,</HI> the bill pro|vides, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall immediately enter into, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of all lands, tenements, hou&s;es, ware-hou&s;es, and other build|ings whatever, belonging to the &s;aid Company, and all books, records, char|ters, &amp;c. and all &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els, goods, wares, merchandi&s;es, money, &s;ecurities for money, and all other ef|fects what&s;oever; and the Directors of the &s;aid Company, and all officers and &s;ervants thereof, are hereby injoined, immediately upon the requi&s;ition of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners, to deliver to them, or to &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hall
<PB N="10" REF="10">
appoint, the &s;everal matters aforemen|tioned."</Q></P>
<P>Can a more tremenduous exerci&s;e of arbitrary power be figured than this?&mdash;That a great Company which has &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed for above two centuries, under the &s;anction of charters from the Crown, &s;hould all at once not only be deprived of the territorial power, which it has ac|quired, and which has no doubt been flagitiou&s;ly abu&s;ed by &s;ome of its &s;er|vants; but have all its effects, in all parts of the world, ab&s;tracted from its own care and management, and delivered up to a &s;et of men not of its own appoint|ment. There is &s;omething in this &s;o &s;hocking to the fir&s;t notions of property and ju&s;tice, as mu&s;t make us &s;hudder with con&s;ternation. Were &s;uch a bill to pa&s;s into a law, the expre&s;&s;ion <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What is a charter but a &s;heet of parchment with a bit of wax dangling to it,"</Q> might be uttered without being &s;tigma|tized as gro&s;sly indecent; for there
<PB N="11" REF="11" MS="y">
would then be no force in a charter, the e&s;&s;ence of which is not <HI>matter</HI> but <HI>&s;pirit.</HI> If an Attorney General were hanged, it might be &s;aid with vulgar triumph, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What is an Attorney General, but a carca&s;e dangling the end of a rope?"</Q> But can &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions be u&s;ed with propriety, while a charter contains the faith of Maje&s;ty, and the per&s;on of an Attorney General, is dignified with an important tru&s;t from the King?</P>
<P>It is well known, that many indivi|duals of different nations have their whole property ve&s;ted in the funds of the Ea&s;t-India Company, becau&s;e it hath hi|therto been believed, that in this great and free country, there is no danger of &s;uch confi&s;cations or &s;eizures by an un|expected &s;tretch of power, as have &s;ome|times happened in other countries in Eu|rope; but had this rapacious gra&s;p been &s;ucce&s;sful, Where would have been our boa&s;ted pre-eminence of &s;ecurity? And how wofully mu&s;t our national credit
<PB N="12" REF="12">
have &s;unk? What mu&s;t the moneyed men of Holland have thought of &s;uch <HI>better</HI> regulating of commercial concerns? They mu&s;t have thought of their own <HI>verbeetering buys,</HI> where criminals are &s;ore|ly puni&s;hed to make them <HI>better.</HI> The Hou&s;e of Commons mu&s;t have appeared a Hou&s;e of Correction with a vengeance.</P>
<P>The inju&s;tice of the mea&s;ure would have been the &s;ame to the proprietors of whatever nation, but mu&s;t have been pe|culiarly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e of our own country, who for a long period of time have been habituated to the per&s;ua&s;ion, that a Royal Charter is &s;o &s;acred, that no|thing but the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons, amount|ing almo&s;t to the plea of nece&s;&s;ity, can be permitted to annual or alter it.</P>
<P>We, in this part of the united king|dom, experienced in the late reign an ex|tinction of a number of chartered rights, by the act aboli&s;hing heritable juri&s;dic|tions. A clamour was rai&s;ed at the time, and there are &s;till &s;ome who per&s;i&s;t in
<PB N="13" REF="13">
maintaining that this was an infringe|ment of the Articles of the Union, by which it was &s;tipulated that the juri&s;dic|tion and courts of Scotland &s;hould re|main as before. But upon looking at|tentively at the Articles, it will be found that the heritable juri&s;dictions were to be re&s;erved only <HI>as rights of property:</HI> Con&s;equently, they, like other rights of property, might at any time be taken from the owners by the Legi&s;lature for the greater good of the publick. The hereditary juri&s;dictions were grants from the Sovereign, delegating parcels of his power; and when they were aboli&s;hed in the per&s;ons of private territorial pro|prietors, they were ab&s;orbed in his Ma|je&s;ty, the great fountain from which they originally flowed, and from whence they now i&s;&s;ue in a different manner. Whe|ther the act aboli&s;hing heritable juri&s;|dictions was a beneficial mea&s;ure or not, may be fairly que&s;tioned; for my own part, I &s;hould be better plea&s;ed to live
<PB N="14" REF="14">
under the immediate juri&s;diction of an hereditary Lord, of ancient and generous blood, than under that of a lower man, who by occa&s;ional intere&s;t has been ap|pointed a Sheriff. The former was as much under the controul of higher au|thority as the latter. But I am not go|ing to di&s;cu&s;s the que&s;tion. I mention the mea&s;ure as an act of State coming nearer <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;oms"</Q> of my countrymen; and that I might recal to their remembrance the deliberation and delicacy with which it was conducted, and the compen&s;ation which was made to tho&s;e who were deprived of their rights. Yet what is the gratification of pride by additional power, when compared with the e&s;&s;ential value of property?</P>
<P>How different was the conduct of the Ea&s;t-India bill? Was any kind of compen|&s;ation to the Proprietors of that Company ever propo&s;ed? Was there any tender|ne&s;s &s;hewn to tho&s;e who had their whole property at &s;take? No. The tyranny of
<PB N="15" REF="15">
that audacious bill, (I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be allowed this expre&s;&s;ion) was unfeeling and inflex|ible; thou&s;ands were to behold all that they had upon earth wre&s;ted from them, and committed to &s;trangers, while no|thing was left to them but amazement and grief. Was this bill &s;edately and deliberately con&s;idered by the Hou&s;e of Commons? Was full time given not on|ly to the Proprietors, but to the nation at large, with humble confidence to &s;tate their objections to it? No. It was hur|ried on in a manner which will not &s;oon be forgotten. The rapidity of its cour&s;e, and its ill-looking appearance, indicated its character; and when it came into the Hou&s;e of Lords, the alarm was,&mdash;<HI>Stop thief.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;olemn attention paid to a &s;ubject of &s;uch magnitude, by that mo&s;t Ho|nourable Hou&s;e where the &s;tate of the Ea&s;t-India Company was proved to re|quire no de&s;perate remedy; and the vote by which the bill was rejected, will ever
<PB N="16" REF="16">
be remembered with admiration and gra|titude, not only by the great Company which was immediately concerned, but by every Corporation in the kingdom; and indeed by every man who holds any thing valuable by charter. While that portentous bill was &s;u&s;pended over our heads, every man was a&s;king his neigh|bour, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What will be done next?"</Q> Cities, towns, banks, ho&s;pitals, were in danger, and in&s;ignificance was the only &s;ecurity. The comfort and joy at being relieved from &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, could not but be great and univer&s;al.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, as to the <HI>Con&s;titu|tion,</HI> the bill provides, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a certain number of per&s;ons to be named by this bill, &s;hall be Commi&s;&s;ioners for governing and managing the &s;aid ter|ritorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and commerce."</Q></P>
<P> And, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners, or the majority thereof, &s;hall have full power to remove, &s;u&s;pend, appoint or re&s;tore
<PB N="17" REF="17">
all per&s;ons what&s;oever, from or to any office, civil or military, whether &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hall have been appointed by acts of Parliament, or how&s;oever o|therwi&s;e appointed, except as herein provided."</Q></P>
<P>Here, then, we were to have had the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a dominion civil and military, of va&s;t and various extent, ve&s;ted in per&s;ons independent of his mo&s;t &s;acred Maje&s;ty, the lawful Sove|reign of the realm. The patronage an|nexed to this dominion would have been immen&s;e, and infinitely beyond what is annexed to the crown of Great Britain. The very &s;ame Right Honourable Gen|tleman who in&s;i&s;ted that the influence of the Crown ought to be dimini&s;hed, and actually prevailed in having it rigid|ly curtailed, drove on this bill, by which &s;even men propo&s;ed by him&s;elf were to have an influence far beyond what the Crown ever had. If both the&s;e mea&s;ures were parts of one preconceived plan; if,
<PB N="18" REF="18">
while he was dimini&s;hing the power of the Crown, he entertained the project of aggrandizing his own power, his abili|ties, great as we mu&s;t acknowledge them to be, are yet of mightier extent than we have ever imagined. Had the appoint|ment taken place, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Crown would have been a bawble which no man of &s;pirit would have cho&s;en to wear,"</Q> as was nobly &s;aid by a great and intrepid Ma|&s;ter of our con&s;titution, and mo&s;t power|ful Orator. There would have been in Britain one con&s;titutional King,&mdash;and an uncon&s;titutional heptarchy, not of Kings, but of Emperors, and that heptar|chy nominated by the Right Honourable Gentleman. He might then have bid defiance to any other power in the king|dom. He might have had his commi&s;|&s;ion prolonged during all the days of his life, and &s;at &s;upreme in his circle of the Hou&s;e of Commons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a &s;evenfold &s;hield
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;vulgi &s;tante corona,</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19">
But this a&s;toni&s;hing project has been happily defeated by the Hou&s;e of Lords, the hereditary Coun&s;ellors of the King. The &s;peech of the Earl of <HI>Abingdon,</HI> u|pon that memorable occa&s;ion, will re|main as a di&s;tingui&s;hed example of con|&s;titutional knowledge and legi&s;lative &s;pi|rit. Had there been nothing again&s;t the bill, but its violation of chartered pro|perty, I &s;hould have thought it de&s;erved its fate, and many of the Lords put their negative upon that ground. But when it was equally ho&s;tile to the King, and to the people; and while on one hand, it <HI>directly</HI> da&s;hed in pieces the &s;ecurity of chartered property; it, on the other hand, <HI>indirectly,</HI> overwhelmed the Royal prerogative, there were two forcible rea&s;ons for throwing it out. The la&s;t was the ground taken by the <HI>Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury,</HI> who with the dignified candour which is to be found in every one of the noble family of <HI>Bar|rington,</HI> offered to give his a&s;&s;ent to the
<PB N="20" REF="20">
bill, if the Mini&s;try would a&s;&s;ure him that the King &s;hould have the appoint|ment of the Commi&s;&s;ioners. But that would have been fru&s;trating the enor|mous &s;cheme of mini&s;terial influence, the principal object of the bill.</P>
<P>The ferment which hath &s;ince agita|ted the Hou&s;e of Commons, need nei|ther &s;urpri&s;e nor alarm us; becau&s;e there is no wonder that the great majority, who voted for the bill, &s;hould be angry at their di&s;appointment. That there &s;hould have been &s;uch a majority, for &s;uch a mea&s;ure, is &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. I for|bear to conjecture the cau&s;e; &s;orry I am that to &s;ome of the number may be &s;aid <HI>et tu Brute!</HI> But it is &s;urely not a &s;trange thing, that the Nobles of the land &s;hould &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t a bill which would have been &s;o fatal to the power of the Crown. For as <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> well ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Nobility are the pillars which are reared from among the people, more immediately to &s;upport the Throne,
<PB N="21" REF="21">
and if that falls, they mu&s;t al&s;o be buried under its ruins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book I. Chap. 2.</NOTE>."</Q> The nobility therefore, in this ca&s;e, had a common cau&s;e with the King, Why then &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed? why &s;hould it be <HI>ru|moured,</HI> that the influence of his Maje&s;ty determined them again&s;t a bill which the &s;ecurity of their own Order called upon them to reject?</P>
<P>But were it true, that the Sovereign's di&s;approbation of the bill was conveyed by a re&s;pectable Peer to others of his or|der; that Noble Lord who repre&s;ented his Maje&s;ty in Ireland with &s;o generous a &s;plendour, and &s;o much to the &s;atisfac|tion of that kingdom, might ju&s;tly &s;ay, (I love his phra&s;e,) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will meet the charge with a high head."</Q></P>
<P>He has &s;ince proved to us, that he did not mean the artificial high head of mini&s;terial influence, but the lofty port of con&s;cious rectitude. What Mr Har|ley &s;aid of Sir John Lowther, in the parliament 1693, may be applied to
<PB N="22" REF="22">
him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think <HI>Lowther</HI> has told you the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e; the greatne&s;s of his e&s;tate and mind, makes him too great to be &s;u&s;pected in this matter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grey's Debates, Vol. 10. p. 377.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Can it be &s;eriou&s;ly maintained as con|&s;titutional doctrine, that when the King hath recommended to Parliament, in a &s;peech from the Throne, any particular bu&s;ine&s;s, and a bill is brought in concern|ing that bu&s;ine&s;s, containing clau&s;es to which the King cannot po&s;&s;ibly con&s;ent, his Maje&s;ty &s;hall be re&s;trained from con|&s;ulting with any of his hereditary Coun|&s;ellors, or any per&s;on whatever, and from &s;ignifying his mind either pri|vately or publicly.</P>
<P>It hath been &s;aid, that Mini&s;ters a|lone are re&s;pon&s;ible for public mea&s;ures, and therefore, none but actual Mini&s;ters can be allowed to advi&s;e the Sovereign: But there is here a falacy which it is not difficult to detect. Public mea&s;ures in the <HI>executive</HI> part of admini&s;tration, are tho&s;e for which Mini&s;ters are re&s;pon|&s;ible;
<PB N="23" REF="23">
and therefore, they dare not car|ry into execution what they know to he wrong, or rather what they fear may &s;ubject them to puni&s;hment; but pu|blic mea&s;ures in the <HI>deliberative</HI> part of admini&s;tration, are not within the pro|vince of Mini&s;ters, but belong to Par|liament, until they have pa&s;t both hou&s;es, and come to receive the a&s;&s;ent or negative of the King; and then, and not till then, does the Mini&s;ters re&s;pon|&s;ibility in that branch commence.</P>
<P>While a bill, then, is pending in Par|liament, the Mini&s;ter is perfectly &s;ecure in whatever way the influence of the Crown may be alledged to be u&s;ed; for, Parliament is, or may be, altogether <HI>in|dependent</HI> of that influence; and if being <HI>independent,</HI> they are <HI>&s;wayed</HI> by it, it mu&s;t be the influence of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and therefore an influence of which it would be un|rea&s;onable to complain.</P>
<P>And what is the precedent which has been mentioned for all this jealou&s;y of
<PB N="24" REF="24">
regal influence? It is a precedent taken from that gloomy period of our hi&s;tory, the reign of Charles I. when faction grew more and more virulent, till it became rank rebellion; and by murdering the King, changed our government into anarchy and u&s;urpation. The ca&s;e which has been quoted was in 1641, when the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion in Ireland required &s;peedy and effectual mea&s;ures to be taken, as the affairs of India do at pre&s;ent; and when attention to the former had been recommended from the Throne, as attention to the lat|ter has now been.</P>

<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons ha&s;tily decla|red, that the privileges of Parliament had been broken, and de&s;ired a conference about them with the Lords<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journals of the Hou&s;e of Commons, 17. <HI>Car.</HI> 1. 14th Dec. 1641.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Such is the &s;ub&s;tance of that produc|tion of factious turbulence and effronte|ry, to which a much injured Prince re|turned the following an&s;wer:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"My Lords and Gentlemen,</P><P>"In an&s;wer to your petition concern|ing Our &s;peech to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, the 14th December.</P>
<P>"<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We do declare, that we had no thought or intention of breaking the privileges of Parliament; neither are we &s;atisfied, that our being inform|ed

of any bill tran&s;mitted by the Hou&s;e of Commons to the Hou&s;e of Peers, (e&s;pecially where our learned coun&s;el are admitted by the Peers to &s;peak in our behalf, as they were in this ca&s;e; and therefore our directions nece&s;&s;ary therein), can be judged any breach of the privileges of Parliament.</P>
<P>"And as for our taking notice there|of, and de&s;iring the in&s;erting of a clau&s;e, (of &s;aving all rights), we nei|ther did willingly or knowingly do any thing to the breach of the privi|leges of Parliament; but what we did therein was in the great zeal we had, and ever &s;hall have, to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the rebels in Ireland, the quick di&s;|patch of which bill contributed &s;o much to the effecting thereof; and it could not but have received great de|lay, had it pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es in a way whereunto we could not have gi|ven our royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="29">
"Neither had we any intention to ex|pre&s;s any di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t any par|ticular man, for any opinions or pro|po&s;itions delivered by way of debate in either Hou&s;e; for our intention was, to expre&s;s only a general di&s;like of any que&s;tions that &s;hould be rai&s;ed, e&s;pecially at this time, concerning our prerogative and the liberty of the &s;ub|ject, &s;uch as this is, being but a pre|amble, which might be left out with|out prejudice to the claim, and could not be approved by us without con|cluding our right.</P>
<P>"As for the la&s;t demand, that we &s;hould declare the per&s;ons that gave us information, it is no great wonder that we &s;hould get information of the con|tents of the bill, &s;ince they were pu|bli&s;hed in print before we &s;poke of them; yet though we &s;hould have got|ten notice otherwi&s;e, it is a thing much beneath us, to name any that &s;hould give us information or coun&s;el,

<P>"Our conclu&s;ion is, That we had not the lea&s;t thought of breaking the pri|vileges of Parliament, but &s;hall, by our royal authority, ever protect and up|hold them; and we expect that you will be as careful not to trench upon our ju&s;t prerogative, as we will be not to infringe your ju&s;t privileges and li|berties; and then there will be little di&s;agreement betwixt us hereafter in this point."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journals of the Hou&s;e of Lords, vol. iv. p. 483.</NOTE></P></Q></P>
<P>He to whom this does not appear a &s;ufficient an&s;wer in every re&s;pect, and who can &s;till wi&s;h to copy the petition and remon&s;trance, mu&s;t have a ca&s;t of thinking &s;o different from mine, that it would be in vain for me to argue with him.</P>
<P>Charles I. in&s;tead of talking to his Parliament in the high and imperious tone of Queen Elizabeth, had, with the be&s;t intentions, mildly endeavoured to 
<PB N="31" REF="31">
co-operate with them, in bringing for|ward a matter of great importance, in a manner con&s;i&s;tent with the royal preroga|tive, which it was his Maje&s;ty's bounden duty to maintain. And as di&s;patch was required, his Maje&s;ty fairly notified to his Parliament, that they &s;hould not wa&s;te time in carrying through all the forms, a bill to which he could not a&s;&s;ent, and told them with what limitation he could pa&s;s it. Was not this a wi&s;e and a can|did conduct? And what are we to think of tho&s;e who made an attack upon it? <HI>Pudet hoec opprobria.</HI></P>
<P>And perhaps the ca&s;e of the Ea&s;t-India bill may be ju&s;tly reckoned to fall under the exceptions which Mr <HI>Hat&s;ell,</HI> bred under the patronage of <HI>On&s;low,</HI> the Ga|maliel of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and therefore fully in&s;tructed in its privi|leges, and abundantly zealous for them, admits in his <HI>Precedents,</HI> under the head, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"KING <HI>is not to take notice of bu&s;ine&s;s de|pending.</HI>"</Q> His words are: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There are

of the privileges of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, as it is a proceeding <HI>founded on the fundamental rules of natural ju&s;tice</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hat&s;ell's Precedents of Proceedings in the Hou&s;e of Commons, p. 230-1.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>I de&s;ire to know, if the King was not deeply intere&s;ted in the Ea&s;t-India bill, both as it is transferred to certain Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, great and important chartered rights, which, if forfeited, &s;hould have re|verted to the Crown, and been at his Ma|je&s;ty's di&s;po&s;al; and as it created a new and formidable power, civil and military, independent of his Maje&s;ty? And &s;up|po&s;ing his Maje&s;ty to have, at the time, &s;uch &s;ervants as were more attached to mini&s;terial influence, than to royal pre|rogative, and did not acquaint his Ma|je&s;ty with the purport and tendency of the bill,&mdash;were none of the real friends of the con&s;titution, none of the King's faithful coun&s;ellors, to warn him of the danger; and if warned and convinced,
<PB N="34" REF="34">
was a dead &s;ilence to be kept, and no di&s;approbation to be di&s;covered?</P>
<P>If it be urged, that it would have been more con&s;titutional to have left the mat|ter to the royal negative, I, in the fir&s;t place, deny the propo&s;ition; and, in the next place, I maintain, that acting in that manner might have occa&s;ioned a more violent roar of faction, if we can &s;uppo&s;e the bill to have pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>A notion has been pretty generally en|tertained, that the royal a&s;&s;ent has been refu&s;ed to no bill &s;ince the Revolution. But this is &s;o far from being true, that part of the very Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, which was carried in the Hou&s;e of Commons the other day, is copied from a repre&s;en|tation of that Hou&s;e to William III. in 1693, bearing, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the u&s;age of Par|liament in all times hath been, that what bills have been agreed to by both Hou&s;es, for the redre&s;s of grievances, or other public good, have, when tender|ed

to the Throne, obtained the royal a&s;|&s;ent; and that there are very few in|&s;tances in former reigns, where &s;uch a&s;&s;ent in &s;uch ca&s;es has not been given, and tho&s;e attended with great inconve|niencies to the Crown of England."</Q></P>
<P>And then <HI>reflecting,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that, &s;ince your Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, &s;eve|ral public bills, made by advice of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, have not obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent; and in parti|cular a bill entitled <HI>An Act touching free and impartial Proceedings in Parliament.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>And in conclu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"humbly praying, that, for the future, <HI>you will be graciou&s;|ly plea&s;ed to hearken to the advice of your Parliament, and not to the &s;ecret advice of particular per&s;ons, who may have private intere&s;ts of their own, &s;eparate from the true intere&s;t of your Maje&s;ty and your people</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journals of the Hou&s;e of Commons, January 29. 1693.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Here then we have an in&s;tance of what an outcry may be rai&s;ed, when a
<PB N="36" REF="36">
bill has been permitted to make its way through both Hou&s;es of Parliament, and then is cru&s;hed by the ultimate &s;troke of the royal negative.

<P>What was the an&s;wer made to this re|pre&s;entation, by a Prince who had been but a few years before elected to the throne? Did King William yield to the Hou&s;e of Commons in any degree? Did he &s;toop to promi&s;e a different conduct in compliance with their wi&s;hes? No.&mdash;He gave them a general con&s;titutional decla|ration, which any King might make at any time; and did not &s;ay one word to the particular &s;ubject of the repre&s;enta|tion.</P>

<P>A keen debate on King William's an|&s;wer took place in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, which had, in effect, que&s;tioned his Maje&s;ty's <HI>undoubted prerogative</HI> in refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent.

<P>Addre&s;&s;es, I know, have but too often been pro&s;tituted. That is no rea&s;on why they &s;hould never be pre&s;ented. I do not mean that either <HI>influence</HI> or <HI>&s;olici|tation</HI> &s;hould be u&s;ed: But if my coun|trymen in general are per&s;uaded of the

It was urged by its principal abettor, that there had been no petitions again&s;t it, except from the city of Lon|don, and the borough of Chipping Wy|combe. Let numerous Addre&s;&s;es prove, that time, and not will, was wanting. And as, in con&s;equence of the &s;cheme for e&s;tabli&s;hing a new and formidable power having proved abortive, there is a conflict of parties with re&s;pect to an ad|mini&s;tration, let our mo&s;t gracious Sove|reign, who&s;e exalted worth and benig|nity are far above my panegyric, have the comfort of knowing from his people them&s;elves, how they think and feel: And let Scotland, at the mo&s;t intere&s;t|ing period &s;ince the Re&s;toration, a&s;&s;ume the importance to which &s;he is entitled.</P>

<P>For my own part, I &s;hould claim no credit, did I not flatter my&s;elf, that I practi&s;e what I now pre&s;ume to recom|mend.
