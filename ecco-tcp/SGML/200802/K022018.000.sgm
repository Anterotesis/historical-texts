Mr. FRANCIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. SPEAKER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RISE to move for leave to bring in a Bill to explain and amend an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the Year 1784, for the better regulation of the Ea&s;t-India Company's Affairs. I am deeply &s;en&s;ible, Sir, of the difficulty of the ta&s;k I have undertaken. To move for the e&s;&s;ential alteration of an Act of the Legi&s;lature, again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of a Majority of this Hou&s;e, and to encounter the abilities, which were em|ployed in framing it, and which are likely to be exerted in defending it, is not an attempt, to <HI>me</HI> at lea&s;t, of incon&s;iderable magnitude.
<PB N="6" REF="4">
I can very truly a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that if I were not thoroughly convinced that what I propo&s;e to do is nece&s;&s;ary to be done; if I did not think my&s;elf bound by a &s;pecial duty to make the attempt, and if I were not con&s;cious that my motives for making it were hone&s;t and up|right, I &s;hould neither have the confidence to undertake &s;uch a labour, nor a de|gree of re&s;olution &s;ufficient to go through with it. The con&s;iderations, which have called me to this duty, will, I tru&s;t, &s;upport me in performing it. When I &s;ay that I have the &s;en&s;e of a Majority of the Hou&s;e to en|counter, I mean to pay the greate&s;t tribute to their honour and to their ju&s;tice; &s;ince I pre&s;ume and expect that they will neverthele&s;s hear me with indulgence, that they will li&s;ten to arguments oppo&s;ed to their pre&s;ent impre&s;&s;ions, and be led perhaps by the reflec|tions, which &s;uch arguments may &s;ugge&s;t, to condemn and undo an Act of their own.</P>
<P>There is one preliminary word, including a &s;olicitation, which I &s;hall offer to the Hou&s;e, and particularly to the Right Ho|nourable Gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pitt.</NOTE>, who brought in the
<PB N="7" REF="5">
Bill. It is, that they would &s;eparate and di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ub&s;tance of what I have to &s;ubmit to their con&s;ideration from <HI>my</HI> manner of delivering it.&mdash;That the honour|able Gentleman him&s;elf, if, thro' the di&s;order and embarra&s;&s;ment with which I may &s;peak, he can di&s;cover and collect the force and meaning of what I would expre&s;s, and if that meaning &s;hould appear to him to de|&s;erve con&s;ideration, he will, in the fir&s;t place, allow it due weight in his own mind; and then, if he &s;hould think fit to an&s;wer me, that he will give my arguments the advan|tage of his own expre&s;&s;ion, and encounter them in the armour with which he him&s;elf &s;hall have inve&s;ted them.&mdash;However he may di&s;regard per&s;onal invectives or per&s;onal at|tacks, he ought not to under-value any efforts, that are &s;eriou&s;ly employed in the di&s;charge of a public duty.&mdash;It is the condition, perhaps the burthen of his &s;tation, to li&s;ten to all men with patience and attention, and to collect information wherever it can be found. Between the Honourable Gentleman and me there is no competition; and if
<PB N="8" REF="6">
there were, it ought not to be decided by in|equality of arms. In de&s;iring the honour|able Gentleman's a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t him&s;elf, I certainly invite him to a conduct, that will do him honour. There is but one thing more honourable to the human character; and that, I am not without hopes, may be the re&s;ult of this day's debate. If fortunate|ly, from the reflections, which I mean to &s;ubmit to the Hou&s;e, the honourable Gen|tleman's own mea&s;ure &s;hould &s;tand con|demned or con&s;iderably impeached, in his own mind, I per&s;uade my&s;elf that he will frankly acknowledge his conviction, and act upon it.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon the e&s;&s;ential part of my ta&s;k, there is an explanation to be &s;tated to the Hou&s;e, external to the merits of the motion which I mean to make, yet materially connected with it. This expla|nation regards the time and circum&s;tances, in which I act. It is matter of public no|toriety, though not regularly before the Hou&s;e, that the India Bill was received in India a year ago with great di&s;content, and that pe|titions
<PB N="9" REF="7">
again&s;t it were preparing to be &s;ent over to be laid before Parliament. On one &s;ide then I may be &s;u&s;pected of a ba&s;e inten|tion to avail my&s;elf of the pre&s;ent temper of the di&s;contented parties, for &s;ome mi&s;|chievous purpo&s;e; and, on the other, I may be charged with acting precipitately, and unfairly to the Petitioners them&s;elves, in not waiting for their petition. To the fir&s;t imputation I &s;ay, that my oppo&s;ition to almo&s;t every part of the Bill, but particularly to the Inqui&s;ition and Judicature, was known and declared from the moment when it was introduced, and that I have invariably held the &s;ame language, and expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame &s;entiments concerning it. My objections to the mea&s;ure were no way connected with my opinion of the reception it might meet with in India. Some Gentlemen, who ought to have been better informed, than it appears they were, took upon them to a&s;&s;ure the Hou&s;e, that they had no doubt of its being perfectly well received there; they a&s;&s;ured us it would be received with open arms. I will not deny that, on my own principles,
<PB N="10" REF="8">
perhaps I might have been &s;trictly bound to have moved for an alteration of this law in the cour&s;e of la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. But I had rea&s;ons for not doing &s;o, which I hope will be thought valid. The attention of the Hou&s;e was wholly engaged in the commercial ar|rangement with Ireland. The mo&s;t excep|tionable parts of the India Bill were not to begin to operate till a year or two after|wards; but principally, I wi&s;hed to give time for the &s;en&s;e of the Hou&s;e to cool upon its own Act, and for the general judgment of the nation to be collected on the merits of the mea&s;ure.&mdash;With re&s;pect to any im|pre&s;&s;ion, which the Bill may have made in India, or any mea&s;ures taken there to ob|tain a repeal of it, I beg it may under&s;tood that the bu&s;ine&s;s I am engaged in, and the part I take in it, &s;tands wholly independant and unconnected with any thing &s;aid or done in India; that if the law, in&s;tead of being re|ceived as it has been, had been accepted by the parties immediately concerned in it, as a benefit, I &s;hould not indeed have been &s;o for|ward and officious, as to wi&s;h to protect <HI>them</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="9">
again&s;t an inqui&s;ition and a trial, which they were willing to &s;ubmit to; or to re&s;tore them to rights, which they were willing to relin|qui&s;h; neverthele&s;s I &s;hould have taken the &s;ame cour&s;e I now take. I &s;hould equally have moved for an alteration of this law, that a precedent might not be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, either with or without their con&s;ent, dangerous to the con&s;titution of this i&s;land, and to the rights and &s;ecurity of the com|munity at large.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd objection I an&s;wer, that although I act independently of the Peti|tioners, I am as much in earne&s;t, as they can be, to promote the object of their petition. What I am going to do can|not injure, and may a&s;&s;i&s;t them. In the matter, I take for granted we are agreed. In the manner, I feel my&s;elf bound by con|&s;iderations of duty here, which they are not equally concerned in. Next to the object it&s;elf, it is my wi&s;h, and &s;hall be my en|deavour to accompli&s;h it in a way mo&s;t ho|norable to Parliament, and mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with its dignity; I mean by an appeal to the
<PB N="12" REF="10">
ju&s;tice of Parliament, and to nothing but its ju&s;tice. The object of the Petitioners may be obtained, and the dignity of Parlia|ment may be pre&s;erved together. For this latter purpo&s;e it is material, nay it is e&s;&s;en|tial, that Parliament, in the revi&s;ion of its own Act, &s;hould proceed on its own mo|tion without the influence of any external impul&s;e what&s;oever. On this &s;ubject I need not enlarge. The reflections, that belong to it, are obvious.</P>
<P>There is one plea however, which I mu&s;t beg leave to enter in this place again&s;t all in&s;inuations that have been or may be ha|zarded, again&s;t my integrity in the part I take in the&s;e tran&s;actions; namely, that nothing &s;aid or done now in England, concerning this law, can affect the minds or influence the conduct of our fellow-&s;ubjects in India. The law made its im|pre&s;&s;ion a twelvemonth ago. Whatever the con&s;equences of that impre&s;&s;ion may be, they do not depend on any thing which can be &s;tated now, or foretold con|cerning them, and which cannot reach India
<PB N="13" REF="11">
till many months hence. It is a common artifice for the real author of a misfortune to endeavour to &s;hift the re&s;pon&s;ibility of his own mea&s;ures from him&s;elf to the per|&s;ons, by whom tho&s;e very mea&s;ures were mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ted. By this &s;ort of &s;tratagem, the fore&s;ight of an evil is con|verted into the cau&s;e of it, and the pro|phet is made an&s;werable for the mi&s;chief he foretold. Former predictions on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject have already been fulfilled by events, which are them&s;elves prophetic.</P>
<P>Having thus far cleared the ground and opened the way to my object, the fir&s;t thing I &s;hall attempt, &s;hall be to &s;ub|mit to the Hou&s;e a &s;hort di&s;tinct view of the law as it &s;tands, comprehending the fundamental governing principles, that con|&s;titute its e&s;&s;ence, and the prominent fea|tures that form, if I may u&s;e &s;uch an ex|pre&s;&s;ion, the countenance, the <HI>vultus,</HI> or ge|neral volition of the law. An explanation of this kind is the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e I know in &s;ome in&s;tances, and have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect it may be true in many, that this
<PB N="14" REF="12">
law has not been attentively read nor hither|to very carefully con&s;idered; and I confe&s;s that I am not &s;orry to think &s;o. If I thought the rever&s;e were true, my hopes of &s;ucce&s;s to night would be con&s;iderably abated. As it is, I derive &s;ome encouragement from your neglect. Be&s;ides this, Sir, by begin|ning with a view of the principles, a mi|nute examination into the detail of the Bill will, in a great degree, become unnece&s;&s;ary to my purpo&s;e. If the&s;e leading principles are &s;uch as the Hou&s;e, on a fair review of them, &s;hall think it right to adhere to and confirm, it would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e of mine to &s;hew that there were mi&s;takes or incon&s;i&s;tencies in the detail.&mdash;Defects of that kind belong to all human in&s;titutions, and are ea&s;ily cor|rected. On the other hand, if the principles of the law &s;hould on a fair review of them be reprobated by the Hou&s;e, as fal&s;e, ab|&s;urd and uncon&s;titutional, the great and e&s;&s;ential part of my ta&s;k is accompli&s;hed. I &s;hall have &s;truck a deci&s;ive blow at the root of the tree. The body of it mu&s;t fall and bring the branches to the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13">This law, Sir, obviou&s;ly divides it&s;elf into three great departments, and is therefore to be con&s;idered generally under three points of view: Fir&s;t, The arrangement made for the di&s;tribution and e&s;tabli&s;hment of power at home: Secondly, The arrangement made for the government of the Company's affairs abroad: and finally, The in&s;titution of a &s;pe|cial inqui&s;ition and of a new Judicature in England, for the di&s;covery and trial of of|fences committed in India.&mdash;The fir&s;t, I affirm, &s;tands in direct contradiction to every rational principle of good government; the &s;econd, &s;tands in the &s;ame contradicti|tion, not only to principles but to experi|ence; and the third introduces a capital and dangerous innovation into the crimi|nal juri&s;prudence of this country, for no purpo&s;e of ju&s;tice what&s;oever, that might not have been equally, if not better, ob|tained by the Judicatures that exi&s;t already. I &s;tate my propo&s;itions in terms of great re&s;erve and moderation compared with my opinion, and hope that I &s;hall be able to prove much more than I affirm.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="14">In the fir&s;t place, Sir, I &s;tate it as a mat|ter of fact that, with re&s;pect to the govern|ing power of the India Company in England, the con&s;tant and notorious complaint was, that the power of the Court of Directors was defective and in&s;ufficient to inforce obedience among their Servants abroad, or to puni&s;h their di&s;obedience.&mdash;To remove this cau&s;e of complaint and to &s;upply this defect, recour&s;e has been had at various times to the authority of the Legi&s;lature; and the profe&s;&s;ed object of every Bill, that has been offered to Parliament, for the better regulation of the Company's Affairs, has been to &s;trengthen the executive power of the Company:&mdash;That is, of the Court of Directors, either by giving them ad|ditional powers, or by removing the im|pediments thrown in their way by the inter|po&s;ition of the Court of Proprietors, who did, in reality, dive&s;t the Directors of all their power. Now, Sir, I admit that the general object of creating a power at home, &s;ufficient to inforce and &s;ecure obedience abroad, was proper, wi&s;e, and nece&s;&s;ary. Let
<PB N="17" REF="15">
us &s;ee what cour&s;e the pre&s;ent law has taken to arrive at this ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary object.&mdash;It leaves the o&s;ten&s;ible power of the Com|pany with the Court of Directors. By <HI>them</HI> all orders and in&s;tructions for the govern|ments in India are to be prepared, and by <HI>them</HI> they are to be &s;igned; by <HI>them</HI> al&s;o all appointments to the &s;ervice are apparently to be made:&mdash;Thus far the fact, or the ap|pearance of the fact, is con&s;i&s;tent with the principle.&mdash;I cannot admit a &s;uppo&s;ition that the Legi&s;lature entertained the lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t of the integrity, or even of the wi&s;dom of the Court of Directors. I cannot &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that the Legi&s;lature, profe&s;&s;ing to interpo&s;e its power for the improvement of in&s;titutions, or the correction of abu&s;es, &s;hould have continued the mo&s;t delicate of all tru&s;ts, and the mo&s;t important of all powers, namely, that of the Executive Government, in the very hand, that was believed to have betrayed or abu&s;ed it; or in any hand what|ever that was deemed to be unequal to the performance of the duty.&mdash;The law declares its confidence in the Directors,
<PB N="18" REF="16">
&s;ince it continues, profe&s;&s;edly at lea&s;t, to ve&s;t in the direction an equal power to that they had before. The law clearly &s;up|po&s;es them to have hitherto made a proper u&s;e of &s;uch power as far as they were able to exert it, and therefore profe&s;&s;es to confirm and enlarge it. But the moment you turn over the leaf, you will find that all the&s;e ideas, and provi&s;ions are rever&s;ed:&mdash;That the law a&s;&s;umes a new principle utterly incompatible with that, on which any new power could properly be given to the Directors, or any of their former power could properly be left in their hands.&mdash;It abandons all idea of &s;trength and vigour in the executive power. In&s;tead of uniting that power in &s;ome one board, which could alone make it efficient, the law divides it between two boards, who&s;e operations, from the particular nature of that divi&s;ion, cannot act vigorou&s;ly, even when they act to|gether; and, when they counteract each other, mu&s;t not only be feeble but ridiculous.&mdash;Pow|er, in whatever manner it may be divided between different political per&s;ons, is general|ly impaired by a divi&s;ion; but the &s;pecial
<PB N="19" REF="17">
divi&s;ion of it made by this Bill is more extraordinary than even the idea of dividing it at all. It places all the nominal power of the Company in one &s;et of men, and all the real power in another. The power, that appears to command, is it&s;elf commanded, and obedience is expected to the authority of men, whom the law it&s;elf declares to have no authority at all. If the Company's &s;er|vants were di&s;obedient in former times, when they knew that the orders they received were really the act of the per&s;ons who &s;igned them, what are we to expect at pre&s;ent, when they know, becau&s;e the law it&s;elf tells them &s;o, that the Directors are nothing but formal in&s;truments in the hands of another board, and that they are obliged to put their &s;ignatures, not only to letters and in&s;tructions which they have not drawn up, but to letters and in&s;tructions drawn up in noto|rious contradiction to their declared &s;enti|ments? A more effectual contrivance to excite and irritate a &s;pirit of di&s;obedience, could hardly have been thought of. What language will the &s;ervants hold now to their
<PB N="20" REF="18">
employers, but this in effect.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We were ready to have obeyed you, but we know that the orders we have received are not yours. We know that they are directly oppo&s;ite to your &s;entiments."</Q>
A more plau&s;ible pretence for di&s;obedience, cannot ea&s;ily be imagined. Sir, I am not rea&s;oning upon imaginary ca&s;es. The law has e&s;tabli&s;h|ed two juri&s;dictions over the &s;ame object. We know that they have already cla&s;hed in one very important in&s;tance, and I have rea&s;on to believe that they continue to do &s;o in many others. The very moment the Directors began to act, the Board of Con|troul began to counteract; and the Direct|ors in the end were forced to &s;ign orders, again&s;t which they had previou&s;ly prote&s;ted.</P>
<P>The bad con&s;equences of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem are obvious in theory, and vi&s;ible in fact. What good effects it has produced, and how it can po&s;&s;ibly produce any, mu&s;t be explained by tho&s;e who approve of it.&mdash;The burthen of that explanation makes no part of my under|taking. They, who are of opinion that a dou|ble Government, in which every apparent act
<PB N="21" REF="19">
of power of one hand is the real act of power of the other; in which the power that controuls is it&s;elf controuled; in which the power that commands is it&s;elf com|manded; in which the power, that acts, is known to act again&s;t its own &s;entiments; that &s;uch a Government can be wi&s;e in theory, or efficient in practice, will &s;upport the pre&s;ent law as it &s;tands, for I have &s;tated nothing, which the law it&s;elf does not mo&s;t explicitly enact. They, on the contrary, who may think that a &s;ingle o&s;ten&s;ible Go|vernment is better than a double one; That it provides better for the u&s;es of power, and better fixes and &s;ecures a determinate re|&s;pon&s;ibility to an&s;wer for the abu&s;e of it, will join with me in affirming, that the executive power of the Company ought to be ve&s;ted in one Board, or in one &s;et of men; and whether they prefer a Court of Directors, or any other form of Govern|ment, they mu&s;t equally concur in my con|clu&s;ion, that this part of the pre&s;ent law defeats its purpo&s;e, if that purpo&s;e was to create a government, vigorous on one &s;ide
<PB N="22" REF="20">
and re&s;pon&s;ible on the other; and that, as long as the pre&s;ent law is in force, the Com|pany's affairs are under a government, di|rectly the rever&s;e of what all governments ought to be, and the particular &s;ituation of their affairs mo&s;t urgently demands.</P>
<P>I have &s;tated that the defect, or grievance at home, was want of power over the &s;er|vice abroad. If that propo&s;ition be true, it includes the &s;uppo&s;ition that the &s;ervants abroad abu&s;ed the power, with which they were intru&s;ted, and were di&s;obedient and re|fractory to that, which the law had placed over them.&mdash;There would have been no occa&s;ion to increa&s;e, or &s;trengthen the power at home, if it had not met with a re&s;i&s;tance, which it could not overcome. But I need not have recour&s;e to any implication, how|ever clear, and obvious.&mdash;Every Bill, that has been brought into Parliament on this &s;ubject, takes the affirmative for granted, con&s;iders di&s;obedience as a fact as well as a crime, and denounces various penalties again&s;t it.&mdash;The pre&s;ent law declares, that the wilful di&s;obeying, or the wilfully omitting to
<PB N="23" REF="21">
execute, the orders of the Directors, &s;hall be deemed, or be taken as a mi&s;demeanor at law, and puni&s;hable as &s;uch.&mdash;Now, Sir, I would a&s;k the Right Honourable Gentleman, if &s;uch di&s;obedience has exi&s;ted, who are the per&s;ons mo&s;t likely to have been guilty of it? in what per&s;ons was &s;uch di&s;obedience mo&s;t important in the in&s;tance, and mo&s;t dangerous in the example? Undoubtedly he will an&s;wer me, the Per&s;ons in the highe&s;t tru&s;t and authority in India; they alone could di&s;obey, they alone could execute and inforce the orders of the Directors; they alone are an&s;werable, not only for their own offences, but for every offence, which they promoted by their participation, which they permitted by their negligence, or encouraged by their example. The conclu|&s;ion from this rea&s;oning unavoidably fixes the charge of di&s;obedience upon the highe&s;t power, and the charge of breach of duty upon the highe&s;t tru&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in India. It nece&s;&s;arily fixes both upon the Governor General and Council of Bengal.&mdash;No man, who knows any thing of India, will affirm
<PB N="24" REF="22">
that, if that Council had been determined to do their duty them&s;elves, they could not have compelled all the &s;ubordinate ranks of the &s;ervice to follow their example. Sir, this very law fixes its eye upon the Go|vernor-General and Council, and does, in effect, charge upon them, or the majority of them, all the capital offences, which it reprobates and prohibits.&mdash;What is the pow|er in India that can <HI>pur&s;ue &s;chemes of conque&s;t and exten&s;ion of dominion,</HI> but the Governor General and Council of Bengal? What power can <HI>declare war, or commence ho&s;tili|ties, or enter into any treaty for making war,</HI> but the Governor General and Council? The &s;ubordinate Pre&s;idencies could have adopted no ho&s;tile mea&s;ure of any kind, which the &s;uperior Council might not have in&s;tantly countermanded, if it was propo&s;ed; and ar|re&s;ted, if it was begun.&mdash;There was no po&s;|&s;ibility that Madras or Bombay could carry on war, without the concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Bengal. Be&s;ides that they have no re|&s;ources of their own, any member of each of the&s;e Pre&s;idencies might have been removed
<PB N="25" REF="23">
by the Governor General and Council, if he attempted it. In all the late wars therefore the Governor General and Council mu&s;t be con&s;idered as principals; but it is well known that, in all tho&s;e que&s;tions, the Council was not unanimous.&mdash;The mea&s;ures, which this Act &s;o expre&s;&s;ly condemns, were the Acts of a majority. But even that majority was fictitious, &s;ince it con&s;i&s;ted of the Governor General, and one member of the Council again&s;t the remaining two. In truth, the Governor General's ca&s;ting voice decided every thing; for although the Council ought to have been compo&s;ed of five per&s;ons, the unfortunate death of General Clavering, threw the whole power of government into the hands of two per&s;ons, of whom one by an unre&s;erved concurrence of opinion united his vote and authority in that of the other. Such was the gradual devolution of power in Bengal, until it ended in a point, until it ve&s;ted in the Governor General alone, until it centered in effect in the per&s;on of Mr. Ha&s;tings. His colleague is to an&s;wer for the &s;urrender of the power; but Mr. Ha&s;tings
<PB N="26" REF="24">
is e&s;pecially an&s;werable for the u&s;e that has been made of it. The fact is, that, under the government of a &s;ingle per&s;on, armed with a really undivided power, which the con&s;titution of the Council never meant to give him, all tho&s;e principles, which the pre&s;ent law condemns and prohibits, were brought into action, and produced all tho&s;e effects, which the pre&s;ent law profe&s;&s;es to look back to with indignation, which it threatens hereafter to puni&s;h, or promi&s;es immediately to correct. From the&s;e premi&s;es it might naturally be expected, that the law, when it condemned certain acts, and repro|bated certain principles, would have limited and re&s;trained the power of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who had done &s;uch acts, and avowed &s;uch principles. For what rea&s;on the law &s;hould act on a conclu&s;ion oppo&s;ite to its own premi&s;es, as in fact it has done, has never been accounted for.&mdash;From the ac|knowledged abu&s;e of power, the inference of this law is, that &s;uch power ought to be &s;trengthened and encrea&s;ed. It &s;tates the experience of former abu&s;es, and refu&s;es to
<PB N="27" REF="25">
be guided by it.&mdash;In the fir&s;t place it re|duces the Council from five per&s;ons to four; that is, it profe&s;&s;es to &s;trengthen by contracting it into fewer hands; and then, in order to unite the power of the whole Council in the hand of one per&s;on, it in|tru&s;ts the Governor General with the per|petual exerci&s;e of a ca&s;ting voice as long as the Council con&s;i&s;ts of an even number, and is equally divided; that is, it unites the power and divides the re&s;pon&s;ibility. One would think that they, who had &s;een to what purpo&s;es the power of the ca&s;ting voice had been applied, when it accidentally fell into the hands of a Governor General, would never have propo&s;ed to annex it in perpetuity to that office. But, taking the Bill on it's own principles, and admitting that it might be right to give a con&s;tant predominant power to the Governor General, I affirm that this is the very wor&s;t way of giving it.&mdash;That it does not give it with certainty, and that the framers of the law were afraid or a&s;hamed to look their own principle in the face.&mdash;If a Governor General ought to have &s;uch
<PB N="28" REF="26">
power, it ought to have been avowedly &s;tated, and directly given.&mdash;Otherwi&s;e it may happen, that the power, which you &s;ay is nece&s;&s;ary, may, in fact, never ve&s;t in the Governor General. At all events his tenure of it is precarious. Of cour&s;e the mea&s;ures of the government mu&s;t fluctuate with every accident, that gives or takes away the ope|ration of the ca&s;ting voice.&mdash;By the&s;e ob|&s;ervations, I am far from meaning to admit, that the object is in any degree wi&s;er than the mode. In my mind, the means are ab|&s;urd, and the end is dangerous. I &s;peak from long ob&s;ervation and experience, and with all the deliberation and conviction of which my under&s;tanding is capable, when I affirm, that to unite all the powers of go|vernment in India in one per&s;on, would be a dangerous mea&s;ure in one view of it, and a u&s;ele&s;s mea&s;ure in every other.&mdash;That it may be the cau&s;e of irretrievable mi&s;chief, and can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e, which may not be more effectually accompli&s;hed by another cour&s;e. I well know, Sir, that, at &s;ight of any great di&s;tre&s;s, or mi&s;manage|ment,
<PB N="29" REF="27">
or abu&s;e in public affairs, the fir&s;t idea, that is apt to pre&s;ent it&s;elf to the mind, is that of creating a dictator. When I &s;ay that this is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> idea that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, I mean that it is not the re&s;ult of ex|perience and reflection. I will not argue upon the wi&s;dom of &s;uch an in&s;titution in a political &s;y&s;tem very different from ours.&mdash;An arbitrary monarch, or a republic may perhaps delegate all their power for a li|mited time to one per&s;on, with &s;afety and effect. The dictator had power of life and death; and I will not undertake to deny, though I am far from meaning to admit, that a remedy of &s;uch violence, if it did not kill, might po&s;&s;ibly cure. But remedies of this dangerous vigour are incompatible with our con&s;titution.&mdash;You cannot give the power; and, if you could, it would an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e&mdash;My propo&s;ition is, that, for every good purpo&s;e, attainable under our con&s;titution, a Governor and Council is a much &s;tronger power than any that can be exerci&s;ed by a &s;ingle per&s;on.</P>

A wi&s;e Governor will not only take advice, but he will be glad to have the con&s;tant check and in|&s;pection of a Council over his actions.

Nay, the pre&s;umption is again&s;t him in proportion to the &s;uperiority of his rank and influence.

by factions; if then you find the wi&s;e mea|&s;ures of your Governor General re&s;i&s;ted and defeated, do not condemn the in&s;titution, but blame your&s;elf for the weak or &s;hame|ful choice you have made of the per&s;ons, to who&s;e hands you have committed the exe|cution. On this point I de&s;ire to be un|der&s;tood to &s;peak generally, and not to al|lude to any fact or individual whatever. Now, Sir, let me &s;uppo&s;e, that, under the &s;ame in&s;titution, the choice of per&s;ons were to be directly the rever&s;e of that which I have de&s;cribed:&mdash;That none but men of proper rank, acknowledged ability and un|que&s;tionable integrity; and who&s;e general principles were known to, and approved of by each other, were appointed to this Coun|cil.&mdash;Will any man &s;ay that a Council, &s;o compo&s;ed, is likely to thwart and embarra&s;s a good Governor by a factious oppo&s;ition to his mea&s;ures? No, Sir, they will not weaken his authority by oppo&s;ition, but they will make him powerful indeed by their &s;up|port. A Governor General under&s;tands no|thing of his &s;ituation, if he thinks that any
<PB N="34" REF="32">
power, directly ve&s;ted in his hands, will carry half the &s;way with it, that will al|ways accompany the united Acts of a Go|vernor and Council.&mdash;If he tru&s;ts to his own exclu&s;ive judgement, I tell him, he will find him&s;elf &s;urrounded by &s;ome of the mo&s;t artful men that exi&s;t; on one &s;ide, by natives, who, without our general know|ledge, are infinitely &s;agacious, who ob&s;erve us attentively, and under&s;tand us perfectly; and on the other, by &s;ome Europeans, who, in every thing but their habit and com|plexion, are perfect A&s;iatics. No &s;ingle un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted Engli&s;h judgement is a match for &s;uch men, and for &s;uch peculiar faculties, as will collect about him from the moment of his arrival.&mdash;If again he relies on his exclu&s;ive power, I tell him that, for want of clear and accurate knowledge, he will rarely venture to exert it. Every man, who approaches him, will tell him a diffe|rent &s;tory, or give him a different opinion. He will often doubt, and when he doubts, he will not act at all. No vigorous deter|mination can exi&s;t in a good mind, that is
<PB N="35" REF="33">
not produced by knowledge or conviction. But even his power, when he exerts it, will be feeble and ineffectual again&s;t the univer|&s;al combination and clamour of all ranks and of all intere&s;ts, which will be formed to counteract him in every mea&s;ure, that tends to reduce exorbitant emoluments, or to correct any abu&s;e, from which individuals derive an advantage. In this re&s;pect how|ever, our fellow &s;ubjects in Bengal have full as much morality as we have. In parallel circum&s;tances, the &s;ame thing would happen in England. But, in a great community, the reformer has the voice and approbation of a majority to encourage him. In a very narrow circle he will have no part of the &s;o|ciety, in which he lives, to &s;upport him again&s;t the re&s;t. They will all make common cau&s;e again&s;t him, and &s;ooner or later overcome his re&s;olution, or break his heart. Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that in a plan of general reform, a united Governor and Council may do much;&mdash;a &s;ingle per&s;on can do nothing. For the truth of this pro|po&s;ition, I would readily appeal to Mr. Ha&s;|tings
<PB N="36" REF="34">
him&s;elf; and I would &s;tate the argu|ment to him with an admi&s;&s;ion of all the per|&s;onal preferences and objections, which that gentleman could wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h. Let it be imagined then, that the legi&s;lature, in&s;tead of forcing him to act with men of unequal rank in life, of oppo&s;ite views, of a &s;u&s;|pected or doubtful character, and of an im|practicable temper, &s;uch as General Claver|ing, Colonel Mon&s;on, and my&s;elf, had united him with men of his own ca&s;t and di&s;po&s;ition, with men who&s;e general views and principles determined them to give him the &s;ame cordial and vigorous &s;upport, which he con&s;tantly and uniformly received from Mr. Barwell;&mdash;then would he &s;ay, that a Council, &s;o con&s;tituted, and &s;o acting firmly together, would not have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in it&s;elf, and given the governor a &s;tronger power, than any that could have been ve&s;ted &s;ingly in his per&s;on, or any that he alone could have ventured to exert. I am much mi&s;taken indeed, if, on a ca&s;e &s;o &s;tated, Mr. Ha&s;tings's opinion would differ from mine.&mdash;This at lea&s;t I may affirm
<PB N="37" REF="35">
with certainty, for my late honourable col|leagues as well as for my&s;elf; that if the per&s;onal character, political views, and pub|lic principles of Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Bar|well, had been &s;uch as, concurring with our own, had engaged us to unite cordially with Mr. Ha&s;tings, and to give him a &s;teady and vigorous &s;upport, we &s;hould have thought his government not only more wi&s;ely calculated for all the purpo&s;es of Council and Deliberation, but even &s;tronger in the execution, than any power that could have been ve&s;ted in him alone; and that it would have carried an opinion, a dignity, an au|thority, and a &s;way along with it, which no faction could have re&s;i&s;ted, no combination could have with&s;tood.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e premi&s;es, I come to my conclu&s;ion on the &s;econd general divi&s;ion of the Bill, that the reduction of the Council from five to four was an unwi&s;e mea&s;ure: That every idea of ve&s;ting great exclu&s;ive power in any &s;ingle per&s;on is at once u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous: That, for all good purpo&s;es, a united Council is infinitely more powerful
<PB N="38" REF="36">
than a &s;ingle per&s;on can be; and that even if the principle, on which the pre&s;ent law pro|ceeds, were ever &s;o ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, I mean that of giving &s;pecial powers to a Governor General, this law does not act up to its own principle, or provide for its own object. The power it gives is meanly and indirectly given, and it provides no &s;ecurity for its continuance, for a &s;ingle day, in the Governor General's hands. On the whole therefore, if you di&s;approve of the principle of giving exclu&s;ive power to a &s;ingle per&s;on, you mu&s;t condemn this law for having given too much; but, if you approve of the prin|ciple, you mu&s;t then condemn the law &s;till more &s;trongly for having given too little.</P>
<P>We are now to con&s;ider the third great divi|&s;ion of the Bill; and on this &s;ubject, I confe&s;s I expect not only a general attention, but a general concurrence and &s;upport. However indifferent and unintere&s;ting the good or bad government of the Ea&s;t-India Company's affairs, or the welfare of the people &s;ubject to their power in India, may have been to the nation at large, or to a majority of this
<PB N="39" REF="37">
Hou&s;e, or to any individual member of it, there is not a man in the kingdom, to whom the &s;ubject, that now calls upon you for your attention, ought to be indifferent. At fir&s;t &s;ight, it may perhaps appear to affect only a part of our fellow-&s;ubjects, who are at a di&s;tance from us. If that were true, I &s;till &s;hould think it my duty to appeal to you in their behalf. This law declares that they are not &s;o di&s;tant, as to be out of the reach of its power. To whatever extent we carry that power, let us take care to &s;hew, that our ju&s;tice goes along with it. Let no man in India have rea&s;on to &s;ay, that he is included in the power, and excluded from the ju&s;tice of the legi&s;lature. But, Sir, it is not for <HI>them</HI> alone, that I have undertaken this heavy ta&s;k. The in&s;tant &s;uffering is theirs. The con&s;equence and the danger is yours. <HI>Res agitur ve&s;tra.</HI> A capital innovation is made in the criminal juri&s;prudence of Eng|land. New principles are introduced, not only into the &s;y&s;tem of our laws, but into the manners of the people. A new tri|bunal is erected for the trial of mi&s;de|meanors
<PB N="40" REF="38">
committed in India, and armed or accompanied with powers unheard of in this country. The ancient e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of trial by a jury, and by the country, is renounced as imperfect and inadequate; a new and arbitrary &s;y&s;tem of enquiry and trial is e&s;tabli&s;hed in the room of it; and all this is done for rea&s;ons and pretences equally applicable to any other &s;ort of crime, and any other &s;pecies of offender. This &s;y&s;tem, con&s;idered as a fact, I deem to be unju&s;t and arbitrary.&mdash;Con&s;idering it as a precedent, it holds out a general menace to the whole kingdom; it acts directly upon a few, but it threatens us all.&mdash;If by the immediate acquie&s;cence of the parties, if by their vo|luntary &s;urrender of their rights, the in&s;tant inju&s;tice of the fact could be palliated or removed, the danger of the precedent would be increa&s;ed; for who would regard a di&s;tant menace, if he, who was actually wounded, were to &s;uppre&s;s his re&s;entment, or to ad|mit by his &s;ilence, that he had no rea&s;on to complain.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="39">In agitating this part of my &s;ubject, the principle I &s;et out with, and the main ground I take, is not only &s;upported by the obvious dictates of policy and rea&s;on, but by the highe&s;t authority, by which Par|liament can be in&s;tructed. The autho|rity I &s;peak of is at all times intitled to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect; but, to the re|&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of this Hou&s;e of Com|mons in particular, and of the pre&s;ent ad|mini&s;tration, its claim is &s;pecial, and not to be re&s;i&s;ted.

done all the duty demanded from it, it was &s;till indeed adhered to in terms, and delivered with great and awful &s;olemnity, as an in|&s;truction to this Hou&s;e; but it was at that very moment completely abandoned in fact, and another directly oppo&s;ite to it a&s;&s;umed, and acted upon. In little more than a month after the King had cautioned us from the throne, <HI>never to lo&s;e &s;ight of the effect which any mea&s;ure, to be adopted for the good go|vernment of India, might have on our own con&s;titution, and our deare&s;t intere&s;ts at home,</HI> a Bill was brought into Parliament, which, I affirm, and I have no doubt of being able to prove, attacks the con&s;titution of England in its foundation, and not only threatens but invades the &s;ecurity of every intere&s;t, that ought to be deare&s;t to us at home; which not only &s;hakes the defences of our dome&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, but acts upon principles, which ought not to be admitted under any government or con&s;titution, or in any human &s;ociety what|ever. I de&s;ire it to be under&s;tood, Sir, that in every thing I am going to &s;ay, I keep the King's Speech in view as a beacon, or land|mark,
<PB N="44" REF="42">
by which my cour&s;e &s;hall be directed. In the fir&s;t place, allow me to &s;tate, in a &s;hort general view, what it is that this part of the law enacts. It begins with compelling a &s;et of men, whom the law it&s;elf in &s;ome &s;ort prejudges to be criminal, whom it &s;trongly &s;u&s;pects at lea&s;t if it does not accu&s;e, of having ac|quired fortune by corrupt practices if not by violence and extortion, to deliver an exact inventory of their property on oath, as &s;oon as they arrive in England. Now, Sir, with re&s;pect to men perfectly innocent and un&s;u&s;pected, the be&s;t that can be &s;aid of the law is, that it is harmle&s;s. If that were all, it would then be equally u&s;ele&s;s. From tho&s;e, who are innocent, you can extort no confe&s;&s;ion. But I deny that it is in no ca&s;e a hard&s;hip and inju&s;tice to an hone&s;t man, to oblige him to declare publicly the exact amount of his fortune. Numberle&s;s ca&s;es might be &s;tated, in which it might be, to a very hone&s;t man, a very arbitrary act of oppre&s;&s;ion. It might even happen, that the act might be oppre&s;&s;ive in propor|tion to the innocence of the party; for,
<PB N="45" REF="43">
though his poverty might prove his inno|cence, it may ea&s;ily happen that many a man would wi&s;h to have his innocence prov|ed by any other kind of evidence.&mdash;We do not live in times, in which poverty is re&s;pecta|ble. I fear the contrary is true, and that the law, which compels an hone&s;t man to di&s;cover the narrowne&s;s of his circum&s;tances, whatever it may intend, will in effect only &s;erve or a&s;&s;i&s;t to fling di&s;grace upon ill for|tune, and to make the mo&s;t honourable po|verty ridiculous. Men of this de&s;cription ought certainly to be &s;pared.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, admitting it to be an equitable &s;uppo&s;ition, that guilt and fortune go toge|ther; admitting it to be a &s;ound principle of ju&s;tice, that men &s;hould be tried rather by their wealth than by their actions, let us &s;ee how the law operates on tho&s;e, whom it may have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect; on men, who may really have acquired an im|moderate fortune by very unwarrantable, perhaps very criminal means. See whe|ther the option, which the law holds out out to &s;uch per&s;ons, be likely to produce
<PB N="46" REF="44">
any good effect whatever. It obliges the parties to choo&s;e between a condemnation of them&s;elves by a di&s;covery of their guilt, and a concealment of their guilt by perjury. If this be the option, what is like to be the choice?&mdash;That a man, accu&s;tomed to criminal practices of one kind, will be extremely &s;crupulous about committing another crime to protect the fir&s;t; or that, being already guilty, he will make him&s;elf &s;till more guilty in order to e&s;cape puni&s;hment. In my mind, Sir, all the effect of the law will be, to invite him to add one crime to another; and, if he be already guilty of extortion, of oppre&s;&s;ion, or cruelty, to endeavour to cover it by perjury. In general, it is neither prudent nor equita|ble to place any man between a great danger, or a great temptation on one &s;ide, and a moral or religious obligation on the other. The law &s;hould be tender of creating &s;uch dilemmas. To impo&s;e &s;uch a te&s;t on men, who&s;e integrity you already &s;u&s;pect, is wor&s;e than imprudent. It is an invitation to fal&s;ehood; becau&s;e it annexes the expec|tation of impunity for one offence to the commi&s;&s;ion of another.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="45">The law then, Sir, in the ca&s;e of any complaint made to the Court of Exchequer, of wilful concealment of property, or defect, or eva&s;ion in the di&s;covery, proceeds to &s;ub|ject the party to an&s;wer interrogatories on oath, at the di&s;cretion of the court. In both in&s;tances, it revives a mode of inqui&s;ition and conviction, which the con|&s;titution of this country holds in abhorrence, and which our ance&s;tors vainly imagined they had extirpated for ever, when they aboli&s;hed the Star-chamber. With re&s;pect to the interrogatories, it might be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that they are liable to the &s;ame funda|mental objection, with the method propo&s;ed for extorting a di&s;covery in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; namely, that they place a per&s;on, who by the &s;uppo&s;ition is criminal, between the nece&s;&s;ity of condemning him&s;elf by his vera|city, or acquitting him&s;elf by his fal&s;ehood. But the&s;e interrogatories carry the &s;ame ab|&s;urd and wicked principle a great deal far|ther. They &s;uppo&s;e the party to have been guilty of perjury in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and they call upon him either to convict him&s;elf

<P>The law, having now exerted the ut|mo&s;t of its power to extort a di&s;covery of guilt, by the confe&s;&s;ion of the guilty, pro|ceeds to &s;upply the defects of that mode by another cour&s;e, which indeed &s;eems to pro|mi&s;e a greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s, but in my judgment is &s;till more dete&s;table than the other, becau&s;e it holds out rewards to trea|chery and to ba&s;ene&s;s, and tends to corrupt and de&s;troy all the little morality we have left in private life. This law formally in|troduces into the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of per&s;onal confidence and friend&s;hip, the wor&s;t of all the in&s;truments that ever have been employ|ed by power without right. It acknow|ledges

the office of &s;py and informer to be u&s;eful in the general intercour&s;e of &s;ociety, and rewards him with a &s;hare in the &s;ucce&s;s of his information. Sir, the man, who di&s;covers a crime and brings a criminal to puni&s;hment, performs an honourable duty to the public; but he, who &s;earches into the circum&s;tances of another, who inquires in order to accu&s;e, and who accu&s;es in order to profit by the amount of his di&s;|covery, can be nothing but a traitor in private life; he never can be a u&s;eful &s;ervant to the public. But the temptation held out by this law is not confined to com|mon &s;pies and informers. It goes to per&s;ons much better able to di&s;cover the amount of a concealed fortune, to per&s;ons whom you have particularly tru&s;ted; your agent, your &s;ecretary, your banker, or your friend. Who knows but that the invitation of the law may &s;educe a &s;on to betray his father, a a brother to betray his brother; and, what is wor&s;t of all, perhaps &s;ome per&s;on, whom you have e&s;&s;entially &s;erved, to betray his benefactor. The very money you have lent him, if,

whether wilfully or not, you &s;hould have omitted it in your account, will enable him to accu&s;e you of concealment, and intitle him to &s;hare in the forfeiture that fol|lows.

<P>This appeal to the general &s;en&s;e and judg|ment of the Hou&s;e, I tru&s;t, will not be inef|fectual. But the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e intitles me to look every where for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. There is a particular body of men, powerful in this Hou&s;e, and in this kingdom, who, I think, are bound by many &s;pecial con&s;iderations to take part with me in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. I mean the gentlemen, who have unaccount|ably been mi&s;led to give their con&s;ent to a law, which bears hard upon their former companions, and upon all the connections they have left in India.

Whether they will look back with &s;ympathy and concern to the &s;ituations, in which they were lately placed; or whether, having quitted tho&s;e &s;ituations, they will content them&s;elves with holding to all their de&s;erted friends and companions the ba&s;e exclu&s;ive language of per&s;onal e&s;cape and &s;ecurity&mdash;<HI>Occupet extremum &s;cabies.</HI>&mdash;Sir, I am aware of the turn that may be given to an argument of this nature.

<P>I come now, Sir, to the con&s;ideration of the tribunal and mode of trial, which this Bill creates and &s;ub&s;titutes in the place of the antient trial, which every man in this land is intitled to, even the felon, the mur|derer and the parricide, when he throws him&s;elf upon his country: that is, to be
<PB N="54" REF="52">
tried by twelve indifferent per&s;ons, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible of his own level, and by the law of the land.&mdash;Let us &s;ee what this tri|bunal is, how it is con&s;tituted, and how it is to act. In the fir&s;t place, Sir, it profe&s;&s;es to con&s;i&s;t of thirteen per&s;ons, whom I will &s;uppo&s;e for a moment to be cho&s;en with all the indifference, which the law affects.&mdash;If they be really &s;o cho&s;en, it will not follow that, with re&s;pect to ten of them, namely the four Lords and &s;ix Commoners, any advantage is gained over a jury in point of knowledge, or any other judicial qualification; for I be|lieve it will not be denied, that a &s;pecial jury of Engli&s;h Gentlemen, is ju&s;t as likely to be qualified for this or any other judicial office, as any ten members of the Lords and Com|mons taken at a venture.&mdash;But the po&s;itive di&s;advantages of the new tribunal are many and obvious.&mdash;The Lords and the Judges are not Peers of the criminal. An in&s;titu|tion, that calls on &s;uch per&s;ons for a verdict, renounces every u&s;e and advantage, which the laws of this country annex to the trial of facts by our Peers.&mdash;In favour of what?
<PB N="55" REF="53">
in favour of a tribunal, in which every one of the component parts is placed in a &s;itua|tion in which they were never placed be|fore. This tribunal abandons the wi&s;e and antient &s;eparation of the verdict from the judgment, and unites in the &s;ame per&s;ons the verdict, the explanation of the law, and the &s;entence.&mdash;Lords and Judges are called upon to find the facts, and the Commoners if they will, may determine the law, and pronounce the judgment. The vote of the Commoners on a point of law is ju&s;t as valid as that of the Judge.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the method of chu&s;ing the pannel, I &s;hall avoid &s;aying any thing that may appear invidious, or per&s;onal.&mdash;My cau&s;e is too powerful to want the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of per&s;onal reflections. I &s;tand on public ground, and &s;hall take no other. I &s;tate it therefore only as a matter of fact, not only not denied but defended, that in the very fir&s;t in&s;tance of chu&s;ing the pannel, out of which the new tribunal is to be finally &s;elected, the choice was made by trea&s;ury li&s;ts di&s;tributed among the members of this Hou&s;e, and
<PB N="56" REF="54">
that the per&s;ons named in tho&s;e li&s;ts have been appointed. I &s;tate the fact without ob|&s;ervation, and &s;hall leave it &s;o to the reflec|tions of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The law proceeds to pre&s;cribe a cour&s;e, by which the whole pannel of three Judges, twenty-&s;ix Lords, and forty Com|moners, &s;hall be finally reduced to thirteen per&s;ons, who&s;e names are to be in&s;erted in a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion, in order to form the new tribunal. On this part of the proceed|ing I ob&s;erve, that, admitting the nece&s;&s;ity of changing the form of admini&s;tring cri|minal ju&s;tice, it does not follow that there is any nece&s;&s;ity for renouncing the funda|mental principles, on which that ju&s;tice has been hitherto admini&s;tered in England.&mdash;Your profe&s;t object is to create an impartial tribunal. The formation of a jury is &s;o contrived, that it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould not be impartial. Then why abandon the forms e&s;tabli&s;hed for the choice of a jury?&mdash;The pre&s;ent law does &s;o without rea&s;on or nece&s;&s;ity. It allows the party a right of <HI>peremptory</HI> challenge only again&s;t thirteen of
<PB N="57" REF="55">
the Peers and twenty of the Commoners. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing it proper to admit of none but <HI>peremptory</HI> challenges, why &s;hould the exerci&s;e of that right be &s;topped, as long as a number of Lords and Commoners remain &s;ufficient to form the tribunal. If, on the contrary, it be proper to limit the number of <HI>peremptory</HI> challenges, why &s;hould you re&s;train the party from challenging the re|mainder of the pannel for <HI>cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned?</HI> This, I affirm, is not only an unnece&s;&s;ary departure from the ancient con&s;titution of juries, but a DENIAL of right, compleatly unju&s;t and ab&s;urd.&mdash;It is unju&s;t to force the party to include his challenges for <HI>a cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned</HI> within the number, which you allow him to make <HI>peremptory.</HI> The re&s;ult may be, that you will allow no <HI>peremptory</HI> chal|lenge at all; &s;ince it may very ea&s;ily happen, that all his <HI>peremptory</HI> challenges may lie again&s;t per&s;ons, again&s;t whom he might be ready and de&s;irous to object for &s;pecific rea|&s;on. But can any thing be conceived more ab&s;urd than that the law &s;hould yield per|haps
<PB N="58" REF="56">
to his malignity, perhaps to his caprice, and refu&s;e to li&s;ten to his rea&s;on?</P>
<P>Again&s;t the three Judges, there is to be no challenge allowed, for rea&s;ons I pre&s;ume deduced from the &s;anctity of their charac|ter and the re&s;pect due to their &s;tation. To the former I &s;hall only &s;ay, that Judges may be better men than we are, but they are men; and that ca&s;es occur, in which an exception to a Judge, even in the di&s;|charge of his proper office, would be deem|ed valid, and would force him to retire. To the latter, I &s;ay, that a Judge has no right to carry along with him the re&s;pect, due to his proper &s;tation, when he de&s;cends to any other. I will not challenge him, as long as he maintains the po&s;t, at which the con&s;titution placed him.&mdash;But, if he ac|cepts of another office, if he takes upon him to find the facts, if he conde&s;cends to be a juryman, he mu&s;t accept of that office with all its conditions. He has no claim to the privilege of a Judge, while he does that, which no Judge in this kingdom ever did before.&mdash;But is it impo&s;&s;ible that one of
<PB N="59" REF="57">
the three Judges may be an enemy of the party accu&s;ed? Would you really appoint &s;uch a Judge to try &s;uch a party? and, if the objection were &s;o &s;tated, would you af|firm that it de&s;erved no attention?&mdash;If, even without &s;uppo&s;ing a direct enmity, two men were known to have &s;tood on terms un|friendly to each other, would you appoint one of them to judge the other? Let me appeal to the honour of the learned gentle|man oppo&s;ite to me, who knows what has pa&s;&s;ed in India. If <HI>I</HI> were the per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed, would he choo&s;e Sir Elijah Impey to be my Judge? That gentleman, I pre|&s;ume, would decline the office. But for my&s;elf I can affirm, that if <HI>he</HI> &s;hould be accu&s;ed, I would never &s;it in judgment upon him. I may be pro&s;ecutor,&mdash;I may be evidence again&s;t him;&mdash;but I will never give a judicial vote in any cau&s;e, in which Sir Elijah Impey may be party, unle&s;s I can &s;afely give it for him.</P>
<P>The tribunal, at la&s;t obtained, profe&s;&s;edly con&s;i&s;ts of thirteen per&s;ons. For what rea|&s;on this &s;mall number &s;hould afterwards be
<PB N="60" REF="58">
reduced to &s;even is not explained.&mdash;The whole power of the thirteen is finally com|mitted to a <HI>quorum</HI> of &s;even, provided one of this number be a Judge.&mdash;In &s;o very &s;mall a number it might be thought, that an una|nimous judgment might &s;afely be demanded. In finding the facts at lea&s;t, it might be ex|pected that their verdict &s;hould be unani|mous. But, in this tribunal, a new and dan|gerous principle of deci&s;ion is a&s;&s;umed. The &s;en&s;e of the Court is to be bound and deter|mined by a majority of votes; that is, the facts may be found, the law determined, and the puni&s;hment awarded by four per&s;ons out of &s;even; and the Court may be &s;o compo&s;|ed and divided, that po&s;&s;ibly one Lord, and three Judges may find all the facts again&s;t the finding of three Commoners, or <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;,</HI> that four Commoners may determine the law again&s;t the three Judges. What they <HI>will</HI> do, I know not; but this is what they <HI>may</HI> do under the pre&s;ent in&s;titution.</P>
<P>We are now to con&s;ider the cour&s;e and conduct of the trial. With re&s;pect to the trial of crimes in general, I pre&s;ume it
<PB N="61" REF="59">
will not be denied, that two conditions are e&s;&s;ential to the due admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, at lea&s;t that they have been hitherto thought &s;o in England. The fir&s;t is peculiar to our con&s;titution, that the jury &s;hall not &s;eparate before they have agreed upon their verdict. The law is cautious of expo&s;ing the virtue of jurymen to the temptations, which might be thrown in their way, if they were &s;uffered to go out of Court, and di&s;per&s;e before they had found their verdict. The law will not even confide in their judgment &s;o far, as to &s;uf|fer them to li&s;ten to any extrajudicial evidence whatever. When once they are &s;hut up, all acce&s;s to them is forbidden. Let the Hou&s;e compare the wi&s;dom of the&s;e precautions with the latitude allowed to the pre&s;ent tribunal. The Commi&s;&s;ioners may adjourn from day to day <HI>ad libitum.</HI>&mdash;They may mix in &s;ociety, and li&s;ten to all manner of di&s;|cour&s;es upon the &s;ubject matter of the charge depending before them. If the party accu&s;ed be a very guilty man, he mu&s;t be wealthy in the &s;ame proportion; and if the evidence &s;hould appear to go again&s;t him, what &s;ecu|rity
<PB N="62" REF="60">
have you that he will not attempt to corrupt the integrity of one or other of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, whom he or his agents may meet out of Court and conver&s;e with every day? Since a majority is to decide, it may happen that, by corrupting one out of &s;even, the judgment may be in his favor. In all the&s;e ob&s;ervations, Sir, I earne&s;tly de&s;ire it to be under&s;tood that I &s;peak of in&s;titutions, and not of per&s;ons. The Lords and Com|moners, who compo&s;e the pre&s;ent Pannel, are honourable men. So are we all. But let it be remembered, that laws are made to guard again&s;t what men <HI>may</HI> do, not to tru&s;t to what they <HI>will</HI> do.&mdash;Admitting corruption to be impracticable, there are other &s;orts of influence, again&s;t which the virtue of men &s;hould equally be defended. The lan|guage of per&s;onal enmity, or public odium on one &s;ide, or of intere&s;t, &s;olicitation, or compa&s;&s;ion, on the other, may engage the pa&s;&s;ions, or bias the judgment of the Judge. But, if any of the&s;e Lords and Commoners &s;hould be connected with the admini&s;tration, and if the party accu&s;ed &s;hould be a per&s;on
<PB N="63" REF="61">
whom the Mini&s;ter &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;educe or intimidate; who&s;e fortune, for example, might intitle him to a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons, then look to the con|&s;equence. Who will venture to affirm that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Commi&s;&s;ioner, &s;o con|nected, to &s;ound the inclinations of the mi|ni&s;ter; to appri&s;e him what turn the trial is likely to take, and to receive his in&s;tructions from time to time for his own &s;ub&s;equent conduct.&mdash;Of the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter I am ready to admit, that &s;o ba&s;e a practi&s;e is not to be &s;u&s;pected. Concerning his per&s;onal honour, I am ready to take every thing for granted, that his warme&s;t friends can &s;ay of him. My argument is applied generally to things, not to men, and &s;tands ab&s;tracted from all per&s;onal con&s;iderations what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The &s;econd great condition, which I deem to be e&s;&s;ential to the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and which is admitted to be &s;o not only in this country, but in every other where ju&s;tice is really admini&s;tered, is that the trial &s;hould be <HI>in open Court.</HI> The law of England does not allow that ju&s;tice can be done in &s;ecret; there|fore
<PB N="64" REF="62">
will not &s;uffer the doors of a Court of Ju&s;|tice to be &s;hut. The wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors has deemed the in&s;pection of the public eye upon the proceedings of the Court, to be a powerful guard over the virtue of the Judge; and the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of our Judges have thought it no impeachment of their integri|ty. An open trial obliges the Judge, in every que&s;tion that comes before him, to choo&s;e between his duty, and the lo&s;s of his reputation.&mdash;On the face of the pre&s;ent law, I &s;ee nothing that provides for and &s;ecures a public trial. For any thing that appears to the contrary, the Commi&s;&s;ioners may &s;it, in clo&s;e rece&s;s, in one of the Chambers of the Trea&s;ury. If I am mi&s;taken on this point, I wi&s;h to be corrected, for I &s;hould be &s;orry to load the law with an ill-founded imputation.</P>
<P>Sir, it requires but little ability to &s;hew the dangerous nature and effect of the&s;e in|va&s;ions in the plan and &s;y&s;tem of the laws of England. He, who is able to &s;tate the fact, demon&s;trates the con&s;equence. But we have been told already, and I expect we &s;hall be told
<PB N="65" REF="63">
again, that nece&s;&s;ity &s;uper&s;cedes all principles; that there is no alternative; that offences, committed in India, are of &s;uch a nature that it is impo&s;&s;ible to bring them within the cognizance, and of cour&s;e to &s;ubject them to the verdict of a Jury. It may be &s;o.&mdash;But I own it is a propo&s;ition that pa&s;&s;es my under|&s;tanding. When, by virtue of the powers already ve&s;ted in the Courts below, the ne|ce&s;&s;ary evidence from depo&s;itions taken in writ|ing &s;hall be obtained from India, why the whole of it may not be reduced to di&s;|tinct i&s;&s;ues of fact, on which a Jury may pronounce as well as any other tribunal, is a que&s;tion, to which I am not able to conceive a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. We are not &s;peak|ing of political offences, of crimes again&s;t the &s;tate, which in many ca&s;es perhaps can only be e&s;tabli&s;hed by a minute exa|mination of letters, in&s;tructions and corre&s;|pondence, and by a careful deduction and inference from intricate proceedings to certain motives. The declared and only object of the pre&s;ent law is <HI>to pro&s;ecute and bring to &s;peedy and condign puni&s;hment, per&s;ons guilty of the</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="64">
<HI>crime of extortion and other mi&s;demeanors.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e offences, if committed, are mat|ters of fact, on which, it remains to be proved that a Jury of Engli&s;h Common|ers cannot find a verdict, but on which a Court, con&s;i&s;ting of Judges, Lords and Commoners, can very well find a ver|dict, declare the law, and pronounce a judge|ment. I di&s;tru&s;t my own knowledge too much, and &s;ee too much legal learning op|po&s;ed to me, to undertake to prove a nega|tive to that propo&s;ition. Yet even that ta&s;k would have been undertaken, and I doubt not with &s;ucce&s;s, by a learned Gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. John Lee.</NOTE>, who&s;e heart as well as his learning goes with me on this &s;ubject, if a &s;evere illne&s;s, un|fortunately for me and for the public, had not prevented his attendance this day. I lament his ab&s;ence, though I know I &s;hall not be left without &s;ome powerful legal &s;upport.&mdash;Strictly and properly, the burthen of the proof lies on the affirmative. They, who innovate, are bound to &s;hew a &s;uffici|ent
<PB N="67" REF="65">
po&s;itive rea&s;on for the innovation. They are bound to the direct proof of this clear di&s;tinct propo&s;ition; namely, that a jury <HI>is</HI> ab&s;olutely incapable, and cannot by any means be made capable of trying an act of extortion, or other mi&s;demeanor committed in India. No doctrine, that does not clear|ly and di&s;tinctly go to the full extent and meaning of this propo&s;ition, will &s;upport the pre&s;ent law. The innovation is avow|edly founded on a &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity, and no alternative. But if a Jury either is, or can by any means be made capable of the &s;ervice, you <HI>have</HI> an alternative; the ne|ce&s;&s;ity does not exi&s;t, and you have no pre|tence to innovate. Sir, this will be a &s;e|rious undertaking for men of rank and character in the profe&s;&s;ion. It is not a trial of &s;kill between cunning knowledge and unlearned rea&s;on&mdash;It is not a victory of legal argument over an unlearned individual, contending for his birth-right, which, on &s;uch a que&s;tion, will &s;atisfy the &s;en&s;e and judgment of this nation. The learned per&s;on, who ventures to affirm that the

propo&s;ition is true in the terms, in which I have &s;tated it, &s;hould remember that his character is at &s;take, that he acts under the in&s;pection of the public eye, and that he is going to choo&s;e between his duty and the lo&s;s of his reputation for ever. I will tell him too, that I have good rea&s;on to believe, though I do not directly a&s;&s;ert, that the fir&s;t law authorities in this kingdom are again&s;t him.

<P>Before I conclude this part of my &s;ubject, I flatter my&s;elf the Hou&s;e will allow me to remind them of the little triumph that pre|vailed, when a right honourable friend of of mine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke.</NOTE> declared very lately, that, after long and &s;erious deliberation, he preferred the trial by impeachment to that of pro&s;e|cution in the courts below, for the purpo&s;e of bringing a capital Indian delinquent to ju&s;tice; as if my honourable friend had thereby abandoned the trial by jury, and furni&s;hed the advocates of the pre&s;ent tribu|nal
<PB N="69" REF="67">
with rea&s;on to conclude, that his opinion on this &s;ubject coincided with theirs. I hope to be able to convince the Hou&s;e, that the conclu&s;ion was precipitate, and the triumph premature. I &s;hould indeed have thought my&s;elf unfortunate, if the &s;entiments of my honourable friend had differed from mine on this important que&s;tion. I &s;hould have di&s;tru&s;ted my own mo&s;t deliberate judge|ment, and &s;hould have acted with he&s;itation and reluctance even upon the mo&s;t de|liberate conviction. The relation, in which I &s;tand to my honourable friend gives him every claim over me, that belongs to autho|rity, and ju&s;tifies &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. It is that of a being, that is in&s;tructed, to the being that in|&s;tructs him.&mdash;Sir, I am not here to pronounce my honourable friend's panegyric; nor if I were equal to the ta&s;k, would I now venture to undertake it. It would lead me to reflections, that would utterly di&s;compo&s;e me&mdash;to the recollection of virtues unrewarded, and of veteran &s;ervices growing grey under the ne|glect, if not ingratitude, of his country. If fame be a reward, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it already.
<PB N="70" REF="68">
But I know he looks forward to a higher re|compence. He confides and believes, as I do, that, in &s;ome other exi&s;tence the virtues of men will meet with retribution;&mdash;where they, who have faithfully and gratuitou&s;ly &s;erved mankind,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>&s;hall find the generous labour was not lo&s;t.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>On the point in que&s;tion, there is no dif|ference between us. His opinion comes in aid of mine. Our minds are united, and our principles act together. If it be a con|tradiction to &s;ay that, for the puni&s;hment of crimes of a &s;pecial quality and magnitude, the trial by impeachment is the &s;afe&s;t, the mo&s;t effectual, and the be&s;t; but that, for offences of a lower order, the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed trial by jury &s;hould &s;till be adhered to;&mdash;He, who maintains the affirmative, charges that very contradiction upon the laws, the in&s;titutions, the practi&s;e and the wi&s;dom of England ever &s;ince Parliaments had a being. I am not afraid of erring with &s;uch powerful and venerable authority. The trial by impeachment is founded on a po|pular right coeval with the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.
<PB N="71" REF="69">
&mdash;It is as well known and as well e&s;tabli&s;hed in our con&s;titution, as the trial by jury, though it cannot occur &s;o often. There are ca&s;es of crimes and of criminals, to which no other form of proceeding is adequate, to which no other mode of trial is commen&s;urate. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the trial by impeachment does that, which no other trial can accompli&s;h. It not only forces the crime to an inquiry, it not only demands ju&s;tice again&s;t the criminal, and in&s;ures his puni&s;h|ment, but it provides for another object, which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, is not le&s;s intere&s;t|ing and nece&s;&s;ary, than even ju&s;tice and puni&s;hment. It clears the honour of the nation, in which &s;uch crimes are committed, and to which &s;uch criminals belong. It vin|dicates the character of this country from reproach in the judgment of mankind. The&s;e are the occa&s;ions, in which the pre-eminence of the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of England di&s;|plays it&s;elf over all other nations. Other nations may rival us in our crimes;&mdash;but there the competition ends. In England alone, the dignity of the trial ri&s;es to a level
<PB N="72" REF="70">
with the eminence of the crime. When the Hou&s;e of Commons impeaches, it is a &s;o|lemn appeal to the judgment of the world. When crimes are charged, by which the happine&s;s, if not the exi&s;tence of whole na|tions has been affected, by which &s;tates and princes, and all the highe&s;t orders of men as well as the lowe&s;t have been reduced, by the ba&s;e and iron hand of up&s;tart power, power to mi&s;ery and ruin, the trial by im|peachment makes proclamation to the king|doms and princes of the world, to attend and look on, while the democracy of Eng|land advances in per&s;on to the charge, a&s;|&s;umes the noble office of accu&s;er, and forces the crime to trial before every thing that is great, and noble, and wi&s;e, and learned, and venerable in our country. The crime, the criminal, the pro&s;ecutor, the judges, the au|dience, and the trial, produce and con&s;titute a &s;cene, which no other country can exhibit to the world.&mdash;Let us hope, that the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;o &s;olemn a proceeding will not often exi&s;t hereafter. The con&s;titution has wi&s;ely re&s;erved it for crimes of &s;pecial
<PB N="73" REF="71">
magnitude; and rare, in proportion to their greatne&s;s. The &s;ame con&s;titution has provided, with equal wi&s;dom, for the puni&s;h|ment of offences of an inferior rank, by another cour&s;e equally appropriated to its object. Let my honourable friend pro|ceed therefore to the di&s;charge of that elevated duty, to which his eminent abi|lities call him. There are &s;till other du|ties to be performed by inferior abilities. While <HI>he</HI> travels on in the high road of impeachment, I &s;hall endeavour to attend his cour&s;e, in a narrower track, but in a parallel path. The lines, we act in, nei|ther cro&s;s nor diverge. They are equally directed to the &s;ame general object of ju&s;|tice, and they run together.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, the principal part of my ta&s;k is compleated; for, generally &s;peaking, my pre|&s;ent purpo&s;e is not &s;o much to in&s;titute, as to correct. I mean to take away a great deal, but not to enact much in the place of it. In other circum&s;tances, I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf bound to attempt a great deal more. If I had been united in views and &s;entiments
<PB N="74" REF="72">
with the acting admini&s;tration of the coun|try, and might therefore have hoped for their &s;upport in the plan, and their hearty concur|rence in the execution of a new law on this &s;ubject, I certainly &s;hould have extended my thoughts to a comprehen&s;ive po&s;itive in&s;titu|tion for the better government of India. But, &s;ince I do not &s;tand in that predicament, I mu&s;t adopt another conduct conformable to my &s;ituation. I mu&s;t take care that what|ever I propo&s;e, <HI>rebus &s;ic &s;tantibus,</HI> whether to correct or to enact, the thing I propo&s;e may execute it&s;elf, and not depend for its &s;ucce&s;s on the temper of admini&s;tration. I mu&s;t take care not to aim at any thing but what may really be attainable under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; and finally, that while I am endeavouring to do good, I may be &s;ure of doing no mi&s;chief.&mdash;Acting on the&s;e li|mited principles, I &s;hall proceed to &s;tate to you briefly and generally what I propo&s;e to do; if the motion &s;hould be carried, my purpo&s;e is to extirpate out of this Bill, the principal evil that belongs to it;&mdash;to revert to that, which was good before, or which,
<PB N="75" REF="73">
if not perfect in it&s;elf, has not been im|proved by innovation;&mdash;to &s;trengthen that good if it be feeble, and not to enact much by po&s;itive in&s;titution. I would re|build the Hou&s;e I live in from the founda|tion, if I could; but, &s;ince that is not in my power, I will endeavour to repair it.</P>
<P>Prote&s;ting, as I continue to do, again&s;t the form, in which the executive powers of the India Company in England are actually di&s;|tributed, and declaring as I do that, in my opinion, a more ab&s;urd &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment could not have been imagined, I &s;hall leave it as it &s;tands. I perfectly know that an attempt to alter it would have no chance of &s;ucceeding;&mdash;nor would I tru&s;t the exe|cution of a better &s;y&s;tem in the hands of men, who were adver&s;e to it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the government of Ben|gal, the alteration I &s;hall propo&s;e, is no more than to revert to the former con&s;titution, which this law has very unwi&s;ely altered. I would replace that government in a Gover|nor-General and four Councillors, with nearly the &s;ame powers, with which they
<PB N="76" REF="74">
were inve&s;ted by the Acts of 1773, and 1781. This alteration is ea&s;y and will exe|cute it&s;elf. It has an accidental advantage too, which may recommend it to the favour of tho&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the patronage of the Company. It revives a fifth office of Coun|cillor with ten thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to all that part of the law, which creates an inqui&s;ition, which compells the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain to an&s;wer inter|rogatories on oath, which endeavours to corrupt the virtues of private life by pro|mi&s;ing to make men rich, if they turn trai|tors and informers, and which deprives the &s;ubjects of this kingdom of their great char|tered right, of their common-law right, and of their unalienable birth-right, a trial by their peers,&mdash;my intention is to tear it out of the &s;tatute book. I would era&s;e it, if I could, from the memory of mankind.&mdash;I would replace the criminal law of England, in the &s;tate in which it &s;tood.&mdash;If the powers already given to the Court of King's-Bench, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining evidence from India, be in&s;ufficient, I have no objection to
<PB N="77" REF="75">
enlarging them.&mdash;If the formality of pleading, or the pre&s;ent rules of evidence, or any other formality, &s;tands in the way of ju&s;tice, let the law be altered. But when the evidence is once collected and prepared, let it be &s;ub|mitted to a jury.&mdash;With re&s;pect to written evidence, though I allow it mu&s;t be accepted, &s;ince in &s;ome ca&s;es it may be impo&s;&s;ible to obtain any other, yet I think the pre&s;ent law abu&s;es that conce&s;&s;ion, and carries the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of written evidence to a mo&s;t dan|gerous exce&s;s. It is enacted,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>all</HI> writ|ings, which &s;hall have been tran&s;mitted from the Ea&s;t-Indies to the Court of Di|rectors, by their officers and &s;ervants re&s;i|dent in the Ea&s;t-Indies, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of their corre&s;pondence with the &s;aid Court, and which in any manner relate to the &s;ubject matter of the charge, may be ad|mitted to be offered in evidence."</Q>
The corre&s;pondence, &s;o de&s;cribed, I dare &s;ay amounts to above a hundred large folio volumes every year. It comprehends not only the proceedings of the &s;uperior Councils in India, but tho&s;e of their &s;ubordinate
<PB N="78" REF="76">
Councils, and all the corre&s;pondence of all of them with every individual, with whom they have any tran&s;action or intercour&s;e whatever. The law declares that every thing contained in this enormous heap of writing, may be admitted to be offered in evidence, and then the Court is to &s;ift and examine it. The ta&s;k would be a heavy one, even if a clear certain rule could be e&s;tabli&s;hed for di&s;tingui&s;hing the credible parts of &s;uch evidence from the re&s;t. The effect of this clau&s;e will be to make the Company's cor|re&s;pondence an indirect channel of accu&s;ation between man and man, and to fill it with every thing that intere&s;t, jealou&s;y, or ma|lignity can invent, or that ignorance and folly can believe on any &s;ubject. I will not now attempt to &s;tate any preci&s;e limits, for this dangerous admi&s;&s;ion of written evidence. In general I &s;hall only &s;ay, that authentic copies of the orders of the Court of Directors may be admitted as evidence, when the charge is for di&s;obedience; and that every man's writing, or an undoubted copy of it, may be evidence again&s;t him&s;elf.&mdash;On this point
<PB N="79" REF="77">
I hope to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with legal advice, and to be able to &s;tate my opinion with greater preci&s;ion, if I am permitted to bring in the Bill; and here I &s;hall conclude.&mdash;They, who may differ from me in opinion, cannot rea&s;onably impute the part, I have taken in this bu&s;ine&s;s, to any per&s;onal ap|prehen&s;ion or intere&s;t of my own. As to my&s;elf, I &s;tand as clear of the law, as if I had never been in India; and as to particular friends or connections, I have now but very few in that country. Tho&s;e few, I fear, have not pro&s;pered. If any of them are rich, they have no occa&s;ion to &s;tay there. If any of them are con&s;cious of having u&s;ed improper means to acquire a fortune, they will naturally &s;helter them&s;elves under the pre&s;ent law, by returning to England before January 1787. I attack this law, becau&s;e in fact it holds out protection to the guilty, and tends to corrupt the innocent; becau&s;e it introduces fal&s;e principles into the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; becau&s;e it is unju&s;t in its immediate application, while it e&s;tabli&s;hes a precedent dangerous to this
<PB N="80" REF="78">
kingdom; becau&s;e it takes away the trial by jury, becau&s;e it invades and alters the con|&s;titution, and becau&s;e it &s;hakes the &s;ecurity and threatens the liberty of every &s;ubject of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>I therefore move, That leave be given to bring in a Bill, to explain and amend an Act made in the twenty-fourth year of the reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, intitled
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An Act for the better Regulation and Manage|ment of the Affairs of the Ea&s;t-India Com|pany, and of the Briti&s;h Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in In|dia; and for E&s;tabli&s;hing a Court of Judi|cature for the more &s;peedy and effectual Trial of Per&s;ons, accu&s;ed of Offences com|mitted in the Ea&s;t-Indies.</Q></P>

<P>ON Monday the 13th of March, 1786, Mr. Francis, &s;tated to the Hou&s;e, that, as certain mea&s;ures of very great public im|portance were now in agitation, he thought that &s;uch mea&s;ures ought not to be decided until they had endeavoured to collect, in a con&s;titutional way, the general &s;en&s;e of the nation concerning them; namely, by calling the repre&s;entatives of the people together.&mdash;That the impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings was an object of great public intere&s;t and con|cern.

<P>THE Trial by Jury, or the Country, <HI>per patriam,</HI> is al&s;o that trial by the Peers of every Engli&s;hman, which, as the grand bul|wark of his liberties, is &s;ecured to him by the great charter,
