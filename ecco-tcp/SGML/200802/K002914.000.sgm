<P>SOme Per&s;ons think that laying a Tax upon Printed News, may be of Service; but in my Opinion, it will only give Encouragement to the News Writers to vent their own Opinions thro'|out <HI>England;</HI> be&s;ides the &s;mall Sum that can be rai&s;ed by it is not worth mentioning.</P>

<HEAD>An ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL Men pretend the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Pre&s;s to be a publick Grievance, but it is much ea&s;ier to &s;ay it is &s;o, than to prove it, or pre&s;cribe a proper Remedy; nor is it the ea&s;ie&s;t Grievance to Cure.</P>
<P>To put a general &s;top to publick Printing, would be a check to Learning, a Prohibition of Knowledge, and make In&s;truction Contraband: And as Printing has been own'd to be the mo&s;t u&s;eful Invention ever found out, in order to poli&s;h the Learned World, make men Polite, and encrea&s;e the Knowledge of Letters, and thereby all u&s;eful Arts and Sciences; &s;o the high Perfection of Human Knowledge mu&s;t be at a &s;tand, Improvements &s;top, and the Knowledge of Letters de|cay in the Kingdom, if a general Interruption &s;hould be put to the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P>To Re&s;train the Licentious Extravagance of Au|thors therefore, and bring the Pre&s;s under Regulati|ons, is the Ca&s;e before us, and this is for that Rea&s;on call'd, <HI>An E&s;&s;ay on the Regulation of the Pre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>'Twould be endle&s;s to examine the Liberty taken by the Men of Wit in the World, the loo&s;e they give them&s;elves in Print, at Religion, at Government, at Scandal; the prodigious loo&s;ene&s;s of the Pen, in broaching new Opinions in Religion, as well as in Politicks, are real Scandals to the Nation, and well de|&s;erve a Regulation.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">
No Nation in the Chri&s;tian World, but ours, would have &s;uffered &s;uch Books as <HI>A&s;gill</HI> upon Death; <HI>Coward</HI> again&s;t the Immortality of the Soul; &mdash; on Poli|gamy; &mdash; again&s;t the Trinity; <HI>B&mdash;t</HI>'s Theo|ry; and abundance more tending to Athei&s;m, Here|&s;ie, and Irreligion, without a publick Cen&s;ure, nor &s;hould the Authors have gone without Cen&s;ure and Puni&s;hment, in any place in <HI>Europe,</HI> but here.</P>
<P>On the&s;e accounts, I cannot but agree that a Regu|lation, or due Re&s;traint of the Pre&s;s, is a good work. But the next and mo&s;t material Enquiry is, how &s;hall it be obtain'd?</P>
<P>By a Licen&s;e Office, &s;ays a Me&s;&s;enger of the Pre&s;s, that I may be employ'd to make work in the Town, as has been done in the days of yore.</P>
<P>That this is the hopes of a forward Party upon that head, is very plain to make out, but I &s;hall avoid charging any Body, and only proceed to examine what are the proper Con&s;equences of a Licen&s;e to the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It makes the Pre&s;s a &s;lave to a Party; let it be which Party it will, I meddle not with that; but whatever Party of Men obtain the Reins of Ma|nagement, and have power to name the Per&s;on who &s;hall Licen&s;e the Pre&s;s, that Party of Men have the whole power of keeping the World in Ignorance, in all matters relating to Religion or Policy, &s;ince the Writers of that Party &s;hall have full liberty to impo&s;e their Notions upon the World, and if any Man offers to reply, the Licen&s;er &s;hall refu&s;e the Copy.</P>
<P>This has been accounted Arbitrary, and not the lea&s;t Grievance in former Reigns; for indeed an ab|&s;olute &s;ubmitting the Pre&s;s to the will of a Licen&s;er, is bringing the whole Trade of Books, and the whole Body of Learning, under the Arbitrary Power of Mer|cenary Men.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
The Labours of the mo&s;t capable Scholar, the Ela|borate Works of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Arti&s;t, the mo&s;t Practical Di&s;cour&s;e on the Divine&s;t Subject, Di&s;&s;erta|tions and Tran&s;actions in all Sciences &s;hall fall to the Ground, and the Student lo&s;e his Years of Labour, and the World the Advantage of his Learning and Parts, unle&s;s a &s;um of Mony can be rais'd to bribe a Merce|nary Licen&s;er, and a Hackney Me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>'Twould be endle&s;s to reckon up the many Volumes on all needful Subjects, which were ab&s;olutely rejected in the days of the Pre&s;s's Re&s;triction, when the mo&s;t Orthodox Divinity was &s;uppre&s;s'd, becau&s;e the Man was not approv'd that wrote it, and a Book was Damn'd for the Author, not the Author for the Book.</P>
<P>This was a branch of Arbitrary Power in the Go|vernment; for in Rightful Power in they do not Tyrannize them&s;elves, but if the Officers are allow'd to impo&s;e upon them, Under-Spur-leathers are always the Tyrants; a Government regulated by Laws, and Govern'd according to &s;uch Regulations, never wil|lingly put it into the power of any Inferiour Officer to Tyrannize over his fellow Subjects.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve there are &s;orts of people who are willing to promote a general Licen&s;e, and very &s;tudious to defend it; but 'tis plain they are &s;uch as promote Prin|ciples in Argument, which they can but very &s;orrily defend; and flattering them&s;elves, from what Grounds I believe they them&s;elves hardly know; that they may obtain a Licen&s;er to their Advantage, they &s;up|po&s;e from thence a liberty to obtrude their prepo&s;te|rous Notions upon the World, and by favour of a Law and an Arbitrary Licen&s;er, partial to their own Factions, &s;uppre&s;s the po&s;&s;ibility of a reply.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are in the right to de&s;ire &s;uch a thing, as a Licen&s;er; for fal&s;e and de&s;igning Rea&s;oning, re|quires
<PB N="6" REF="6">
the &s;upport of Power to defend it from the invincible force of Truth and Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>But methinks they &s;hould be able to &s;ee that the pre&s;ent Government is not &s;o &s;uited to tho&s;e Principles, as that they &s;hould expect &s;o Arbitrary and unju&s;tifia|ble an Office &s;hould be erected, after &s;o many Years being laid &s;ide.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>England</HI> do not believe the Parlia|ment will make a Law to abridge them of that Liberty they &s;hould protect, for tho' it were more true than it is, that the Exorbitances of the Pre&s;s ought to be re&s;train'd, yet I cannot &s;ee how the &s;upervi&s;ing, and pa&s;&s;ing all the Works of the Learned part of the World by one or a few Men, and giving them an ab&s;olute Negative on the Pre&s;s, can po&s;&s;ibly be reconcil'd to the liberty of the <HI>Engli&s;h Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Laws are often made again&s;t Facts not in them&s;elves unlawful, but as Convenience and Rea&s;on of State re|quires, and Circum&s;tances may make a thing unfit to be allow'd in a Country, which would otherwi&s;e be no Crime; but in the&s;e Ca&s;es &s;uch Laws are enforc'd by a Penalty, and he that will &s;uffer the Penalty, is always at Liberty to commit the Crime.</P>
<P>But in this ca&s;e a Man is abridg'd of his Liberty; and mu&s;t not do this or that, whether it Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;es the Law or no. For Example, a per&s;on having Writ a Book, brings it to one or other Licen&s;er, the Law is not expre&s;s that &s;uch a Book &s;hall not appear in the World, there is no Crime committed, but the Book &s;hall be Damn'd in its Womb, not becau&s;e any thing in it is offen&s;ive to the Government, Irreligious, Bla&s;phemous, or any other way Criminal, not be|cau&s;e 'tis a Book unfit to appear, but becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Li|cen&s;er</HI> does not plea&s;e to like it.</P>
<P>I know no Nation in the World, who&s;e Govern|ment
<PB N="7" REF="7">
is not perfectly De&s;potick, that ever makes pre|ventive Laws, 'tis enough to make Laws to puni&s;h Crimes when they are committed, and not to put it in the power of any &s;ingle Man, on pretence of pre|venting Offences to commit wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Even the Laws again&s;t Theft and Murther, do not &s;ay they &s;hall not commit the Crime, but if they do, they &s;hall be &s;o and &s;o puni&s;h'd. 'Tis for the Com|mands of God to &s;ay, <HI>Thou &s;halt not do this or that; Kill, Steal, commit Adultery,</HI> and the like; but Man can only &s;ay, if any Man &s;hall wilfully do this, or that, commit this or that Crime, he &s;hall &s;uffer &s;uch or &s;uch Pains, and Penalties; and &s;ome are of opini|on, all men have a Native right, <HI>as to Human Liberty,</HI> to commit any Fact, if they &s;ubmit to the penalty which the Law inflicts; for as to its being a &s;in a|gain&s;t God, the Laws have nothing to &s;ay to that, and as to a &s;in again&s;t Civil Government, there can be no &s;uch thing as a Crime till the Fact is committed, and therefore to anticipate the Man by Laws, before the Crime, is to abridge him of his Liberty without a Crime, and &s;o make a Puni&s;hment without a Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, which is illegal in its own Nature, and Ar|bitrary in the mo&s;t inten&s;e degree.</P>
<P>It might not be improper here to Examine what particular Inconveniences attend &s;uch a Law in our pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and upon what ju&s;t Grounds I except again&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. I object again&s;t it as the fir&s;t &s;tep to re&s;tore Ar|bitrary Power in this Nation, and the wor&s;t way of re&s;toring it, <HI>viz.</HI> by a Law. For to go back again to that which we once complain'd of as Arbitrary, is a tacit acknowledging the former Complaint to be groundle&s;s, and giving us cau&s;e to think that there's more &s;teps of that Nature to be introduc'd.</P>
<P>'Tis ill making Precedents in ca&s;es &s;o dangerous, where
<PB N="8" REF="8">
the Liberty of a Nation is concern'd; and I cannot doubt but our wi&s;e Legi&s;lators will con&s;ider what the Con|&s;equences of yielding in the lea&s;t point of the Subjects Priviledges are, and we have always found them very tender of the lea&s;t punctilio's of that great Fundamen|tal, the Peoples Liberty. 'Tis needle&s;s to quote Ca&s;es, the general practice of the Hou&s;e of Commons, ever &s;ince the liberty of the Subject, was to &s;ecure the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> freedom, and carefully to watch again&s;t all En|croachments of any &s;ort, either from without or from any Parties among them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis a Foundation of Frauds, Briberies, and all the ill practices po&s;&s;ible; the ab&s;olute conduct of &s;o con&s;iderable an Article, being committed to the Brea&s;t of a few Men, every part of their proceedings are Arbitrary and Unrea&s;onable: Nay, even when he pa&s;|&s;es a Book that ought to be pa&s;s'd, yet 'tis Arbitrary in him, becau&s;e he pa&s;&s;es it not becau&s;e it ought &s;o to be pa&s;s'd, but becau&s;e he has receiv'd &s;ome Perqui&s;ite, Gra|tuity, or other Argument to prevail upon him to do it.</P>
<P>Take this Licen&s;er without a Fee, and fancy an Au|thor brings a Copy to him, &s;uppo&s;e of Divinity, and where is the Book again&s;t which he can find no excu&s;e, tho' Penn'd with never &s;o much caution? here it reflects upon the Church, there upon the Government; this &s;eems to look a&s;quint on &s;uch an Article of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that at too much a Ceremony in the Liturgy and Rubrick, and he cannot allow it to be Publi&s;h'd; but &s;end him the next morning two or three <HI>Gunieas,</HI> and you have the <HI>Imprimatur</HI> at fir&s;t word. Suppo&s;e it be a Book of Politicks, then this Sentence is a reflecti|on on this great Man, that on another, this may &s;ig|nifie the Parliament, that the King or Queen, but &s;till the Guineas &s;ets it all to right again, the Gold makes the Book Orthodox and Loyal, and private Con&s;tru|ctive Objections vani&s;h in the Mi&s;t rai&s;ed before his Eyes by the Mony.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">
Then &s;uppo&s;e this or that Licen&s;er, a Party-Man, that is, One put in, and upheld by a Party; &s;uppo&s;e him of any Party, which you plea&s;e, and a Man of the oppo&s;ite Kidney, brings him a Book, he views the Character of the Man, <HI>O,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I know the Author, he is a damn'd</HI> Whig, <HI>or a rank</HI> Jacobite, <HI>I'll Licen&s;e none of his Writings;</HI> here is Bribery on one Hand, partiality to Parties on the other; but get a Man of his own Kidney to own the very &s;ame Book, and as he refus'd it without opening be|fore, he is as ea&s;ie to pa&s;s it now, not for the Good or Ill in the Book, but on both Hands for the Character of the Author.</P>
<P>There is another Engine of Fraud comes in to make up this Complication of Frauds, and ill Practices, and that is the Me&s;&s;enger of the Pre&s;s, and this &s;erves for the Receiver, while the t'other is the Th&mdash;f, and he takes the Fees, and the Licen&s;er does the Work, and &s;o ca&s;ting up together they bring all to an Account of Profit and Lo&s;s. This is the Broker of the Pre&s;s, the Stock-Jobber of the Licen&s;e-Office; he Talks with you, and Treats with any Body to get a Book Licen&s;ed, and Rates his Fees as he finds the Per&s;on more or le&s;s Obnoxious to his Ma|&s;ter, or his Party.</P>
<P>This is a New Mou&s;e-Trap, and he that will come into the Pre&s;s mu&s;t expect to be catch'd in it, and then in a little Time all the force of the Law, &s;o far as de&s;ign'd again&s;t the Exorbitance of the Pen is Evaded and Eluded, all revolves in the Bribery and Villainy of Officers and Li|cen&s;ers, the Law looks like a Phantome of the Brain, made for one Man in an Age to rai&s;e a Fortune by, he mu&s;t turn Round to perform it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
The&s;e Things have often been con&s;ider'd in Parliament, and have been the true Rea&s;ons why our Wi&s;e Repre&s;en|ters, tho' willing enough to Re&s;train any undue Liberty, yet have always avoided this Pernitious Remedy, as a thing of much wor&s;e Con&s;equence to the Con&s;titution and Privileges of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> than the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Pre&s;s can be to the Government.</P>
<P>To Cure the ill U&s;e of Liberty, with a Deprivation of Liberty, is like cutting off the Leg to cure the Gout in the Toe, like expelling Poi&s;on with too Rank a Poi&s;on, where both may &s;truggle which Poi&s;on &s;hall prevail, but which &s;oever prevails, the Patient &s;uffers.</P>
<P>If the Exorbitance of &s;ome few People in Printing Se|ditious and Dangerous Books, mu&s;t Abridge all the Men of Learning in the Nation of their Liberty in Printing, what after exceeding toil and unwearied Pains they are willing to Communicate to Po&s;terity, then who will Stu|dy, who will breed up their Children to Letters, when all the Fruits of their Labours are liable to the Bla&s;t of the Arbitrary Breath of Mercenary Men.</P>
<P>By &s;uch a Law, a Fellow of no Letters, of Knowledge too little to fit him for a Ballad-Singer, &s;hall be Capable of Tyrannizing over the whole World of Learning, and no Book can &s;ee the Light without his leave, when after a Man has wrote enough to have all the World acknowledge him, and &s;uch a Work, which in &s;ome Countries he would have &s;ufficient Gratification for, here he &s;hall not be&s;tow it on the World, without putting him&s;elf to the Charge of Bribing the Licen&s;er, and &s;o cannot give them his Labour, but he mu&s;t give them his Money too.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">
In this very thing the King of <HI>France</HI> out does all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> where &s;uch Encouragement is given to Learning, that all u&s;eful Books in the World now &s;peak <HI>French,</HI> and a Man may be an Univer&s;al Schollar, read <HI>Virgil, Horace, Ovid,</HI> and all the Antient Poets; <HI>Cicero, Plato, Epictetus, Ari&s;totle,</HI> and all the Antient Philo&s;o|phers; St. <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> and all the Primitive Fathers; <HI>Plutarch, Livy,</HI> and all the Antient Hi&s;torians, and yet neither under&s;tand a Word of <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin,</HI> and pray let us Examine if ever the Pre&s;s has been Re|&s;train'd to the Ab&s;olute Power of a Licen&s;er or Revi&s;er, on the contrary all the Liberty and Encouragement ima|ginable has been given to the Pre&s;s, all the Abbies, and publick Libraries in the Kingdom are oblig'd to take One, and when any Author has publi&s;h'd an Extraordinary Piece, the King him&s;elf has thought fit to reward him with a Magnifience, peculiar to the Pride and State of the <HI>French</HI> Court.</P>
<P>But this Liberty has been the Life of Learning, and ever &s;ince Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> Erected the Royal Academy, no Nation in the World ever flouri&s;h'd in Learning like them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation has always carried a figure equal to their Neighbours, as to all &s;orts of Learning, and in &s;ome very much &s;uperior, and tho' without all tho&s;e Encourage|ments, have not yet &s;unk their Character that way. But we cannot &s;ay that Learning is grown to &s;uch a height that it needs a Check, that it wants a Tyrant of the Pre&s;s to govern it: Knowledge is much Improv'd, 'tis confe&s;s'd, but the World is not &s;o over-run with Letters, that it &s;hould be Tax'd as a Vice, and Laws made to Suppre&s;s the little Degrees of it, that are attain'd to.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">
What tho&s;e Gentlemen propo&s;e to them&s;elves who are &s;o forward to procure, or at lea&s;t &s;o eagerly plead for this Padlock to the Pre&s;s, I cannot imagine, unle&s;s it be that they have &s;ome grounds to hope they &s;hall keep the Key.</P>
<P>And what can the de&s;ign of that Power be? If it be that they would have the Advantage to Print what they plea&s;e, and that the adver&s;e Party &s;hould not have the liberty of the Pre&s;s to Reply, is a &s;ign the Cau&s;e they Embark in is not to be Defended, and will not bear an An&s;wer, and if it be that that they would have no Writing at all, but &s;uch points as they are doubtful in, 'tis an Unque&s;tionable Ar|gument that their Cau&s;e won't bear Canva&s;ing, and that the le&s;s 'tis Examined into, the better for them.</P>
<P>Some People have an Arrogance peculiar to them&s;elves, and can venture things into the World upon the Reputati|on of a bold Expre&s;&s;ion, pre&s;uming, no Man will venture Examination after the po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion of their Pen. If the&s;e Gentlemen are &s;o full of A&s;&s;urance, <HI>Anglic&egrave;,</HI> Impu|dence, as to affirm things without Ground, when other Men as well Read as them&s;elves, are at Elbows to Confute them, to Examine their Authorities and reprove them when they Act without Authority; what work would &s;uch Men as the&s;e make in the World with their Cau&s;e, if this Padlock of the Pre&s;s was &s;et on by the Laws, and they were to keep the Key, that is, in &s;hort, if they had a full Licen&s;e to vent their Notions, and the Law &s;hould place a Sentinel of their own at the Door of the Pre&s;s, that no Man but he that had the Word &s;hould come there.</P>
<P>We &s;hould have more <HI>Wi&s;e Nations</HI> quoted upon us for things no Nation ever did, and Precedents brought in by
<PB N="11" REF="13">
Whole&s;ale, without any other Authority than the <HI>Impri|matur</HI> of the Party.</P>
<P>New and Old A&s;&s;ociation Men might then cry out of Rebellion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and make the World believe the <HI>Cameronians</HI> were up in Arms there to re&s;tore <HI>Epi&s;copacy.</HI> Boys may beat Men if their Hands were Ty'd; if the Hands of a Party are ever Ty'd up by a Law of Licen&s;ing, 'tis not then who talks Sen&s;e, or Matter of Fact, nor who has the be&s;t of the Argument, nor who can &s;ay mo&s;t to the purpo&s;e, but who &s;hall be Licen&s;ed to &s;peak what he has to &s;ay, and who not, who &s;hall Talk, and who &s;hall hold his Tongue.</P>
<P>This I take to be the true &s;tate of the Ca&s;e, and if it be &s;o, I leave it to any body to judge, whether a <HI>Licen&s;e of the Pre&s;s</HI> can be con&s;i&s;tent either with the Encouragement due to Learning, the Liberty of this Nation, the Rea&s;on of the thing, or the Reputation of any Party who de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>It remains to Enquire,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Is it then fit the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Pre&s;s &s;hould be Unre&s;train'd? And Secondly, How &s;hall it be done?</P>
<P>To the Fir&s;t I reply. Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of all &s;orts ought to be Re&s;train'd, whether of the Tongue, the Pen, the Pre&s;s, or any thing el&s;e, and it were well if all &s;orts of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s were as ea&s;y to Govern as this; but to Re|gulate this Evil by an Evil ten times more pernicious, is doing us no &s;ervice at all.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
'Tis apparent the Injury done to the whole Nation, by &s;everely Puni&s;hing &s;mall things, and letting more &s;ub|&s;tantial Grievances alone, is what there has been Cau&s;e to Complain of.</P>
<P>There are Parties in all our Ju&s;tice and Crimes have, or have not been Puni&s;h'd, as <HI>Parties</HI> and <HI>Sides</HI> have Go|vern'd. But I am not going to write a Satyr on Govern|ment, &s;everal has paid Dear enough for that; to give me Notice what is to be expected from &s;uch a Liberty; as 'tis in all the World &s;o it has too much been here, where there are <HI>Powers</HI> and <HI>Parties</HI> always &s;truggling, there mu&s;t be a Bya&s;s of Ju&s;tice as this or that <HI>Side</HI> prevails.</P>
<P>But 'tis pitty the Pre&s;s &s;hould come into a Party-&s;trife: This is like two Parties going to War, and one depriving the other of all their Powder and Shot. Ammunition &s;tands always Neuter, or rather, <HI>Jack a both Sides,</HI> every body has it, and then they get the Victory who have mo&s;t Courage to u&s;e it, and Conduct to manage it.</P>
<P>And thus 'tis in the Pre&s;s, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Powers, this I think is a ju&s;t Con&s;equence from Rea&s;on, that &s;ince this Nation is unhappily Divided into Parties, every Side ought to have an equal Advantage in the u&s;e of the Pre&s;s, and this can never be in Ca&s;e of Licen&s;ing; for what&s;oe|ver Party a&s;&s;umes the Power of placing this Paper Magi|&s;trate, will, in effect, have an Exclu&s;ive Power over the Pre&s;s, to give their Friends a full liberty of <HI>Affirming,</HI> and to refu&s;e the other Side the liberty of <HI>Replying.</HI></P>
<P>Now, as our Legi&s;lation cannot be &s;aid to be of any Party, becau&s;e they are Whole; &s;o they cannot make a
<PB N="13" REF="15">
Law which can be equal to the Whole, while it gives the Power to any one Party,</P>
<P>It cannot be prov'd, that any one Party has more Right, <HI>as a Party,</HI> to Publi&s;h any thing than another, and there|fore cannot in Ju&s;tice have more liberty given them to do it: For no Man can ju&s;tly Demand an Exclu&s;ive Power, where he had no precedent Right.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, 'tis a Scandal both to the Merit of a Cau&s;e, and the Wit of the Managers, that any Party &s;hou'd fly to the Law to &s;uppre&s;s his Adver&s;ary's Pen. If two Men fall Out, and one having &s;truck the other, the Per&s;on who receiv'd the Blow in&s;tead of Fighting him goes to Law with him for the A&s;&s;ault. 'Tis a natural Con&s;equence for all Men to believe &s;uch a Man was afraid to Fight; either he was a Coward in his Nature, or he thought him&s;elf over-matcht, and his Enemy would be too hard for him.</P>
<P>So where a Party flies to the Engine of the Law to pre|vent their Opponent's appearing in Print, it looks like a Confe&s;&s;ion that they would have the Advantage, if the <HI>Li|berty</HI> was not Re&s;train'd by the Law.</P>
<P>But then to have a Law which &s;hould be &s;o Circum|&s;tanc'd, as that one Party &s;hall Write and Print, and the o|ther &s;hall not, this has a further Scandal in it, it not only Confe&s;&s;es &s;uperiority in the Enemy Suppre&s;&s;or, but &s;eems to have &s;omething ba&s;e in the Party, like getting two Men to hold a Man while I Beat him.</P>
<P>The Grand Que&s;tion then &s;eems thus,</P>
<P>You own the Liberty of the Pre&s;s ought to be re|&s;train'd, but you are of the Opinion a Licence is Arbitra|ry
<PB N="14" REF="16">
and Unequal. How then would you have the end An|&s;wer'd?</P>
<P>'Tis not for me to direct the Legi&s;lative Authority, nor do the&s;e Sheets pretend to it, but to me the propere&s;t Me|thods &s;eem to be &s;uch as follow.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To make an Act that no Man &s;hall, by Writing or by Printing, Argue, Di&s;pute, Reflect upon, or pretend to Vin|dicate &s;uch and &s;uch Points, Per&s;ons, Bodies, Members, &amp;c. of the State of the Church, or of any other Matter or Thing as the Law &s;hall mention, and they will be &s;uch as the Law-makers &s;ee proper to in&s;ert.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That if any &s;hall pre&s;ume <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> do &s;o, they &s;hall be puni&s;h'd in &s;uch or &s;uch a Manner.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By the fir&s;t, all Men will know when they Trangre&s;s, which at pre&s;ent, they do not; for as the Ca&s;e now &s;tands, 'tis in the Brea&s;t of the Courts of Ju&s;tice to make any Book a Scandalous and Seditious Libel, and nothing is more ridiculous than the Letter of an Indictment in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and the Jury being accounted only Judges of Evi|dence, Judges of Fact, and not of the Nature of it, the Judges are thereby Unlimited.</P>
<P>In the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Delaun,</HI> who was Indicted at the <HI>Old Baily,</HI> for Writing a Book, call'd, <HI>A Plea for the Noncon|formi&s;ts,</HI> &s;ays the Indictment, <HI>and the &s;aid</HI> Delaun <HI>did then, and there by Force and Arms write the afore&s;aid Scandalous and Seditious Book, again&s;t the Peace of our Severeign Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity,</HI> which are the actual Words in mo&s;t Indictments of that nature.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Evils would be Obviated, and Men might know when they Tran&s;gre&s;s, and when they do not.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
Laws in their Original De&s;ign are not made to draw Men into Crimes, but to prevent Crimes; <HI>Laws are Buoys</HI> &s;et upon dangerous Places under Water, to warn Mankind, that &s;uch Sands or Rocks are there, and the Language of them is, <HI>Come here at your Peril.</HI></P>
<P>The Crime of an Author is not known; and I think verily no Book can be wrote &s;o warily, but that if the Author be brought on his Tryal, it &s;hall be ea&s;y for a cunning Lawyer, ay for a Lawyer of no great Cun|ning, to put an <HI>Innuendo</HI> upon his Meaning, and make &s;ome Part of it Criminal. Thus it was in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Baxter's Comment upon the New Te&s;tament; Algernoon Sidney's An&s;wer to Sir</HI> Robert Filmer; <HI>De Laun's Plea for the Nonconformists;</HI> Anderton'<HI>s two Books;</HI> and &s;o it may be with this Book, or the be&s;t in the World.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince there are Dangers thus conceal'd in the Law, and no Man can tell when he offends, 'twould be a whol&s;ome Piece of Ju&s;tice to all the Nation, to place a <HI>Buoy</HI> on the Rock, and whoever &s;plits on it afterwards would de&s;erve no pity.</P>
<P>Such a Law would be a &s;ufficient Re&s;traint to the Exorbitance of the Pre&s;s, for then the Crime would be plain, and Men would be afraid of committing it. Whereas the pre&s;ent uncertainty of the Crime &s;eems to be the greate&s;t Occa&s;ion of the Crime, for Men are apt to be bold in a Thing which they cannot find ex|pre&s;sly Condemn'd by the Letter of the Law.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As the Crime may be &s;tated, &s;o may the Puni&s;hment, and then no Man can be at the Mercy of arbitrary Men; no <HI>Sidneys</HI> will be found to have Sentence revers'd, and Attainders taken off; no <HI>De Launs</HI> die in Pri&s;on under Exorbitant Fines; no <HI>po&s;t Factum's,</HI> no Complaint can be made by the Per&s;on offending, be|cau&s;e they know what they were to tru&s;t to.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
And aboveall, the End of re&s;training the Pre&s;s would be obtain'd by it; for when Men know both the Crime and the Puni&s;hment, they would be much more wary of the one for fear of the other.</P>
<P>I humbly conceive, the uncertainty of both at pre&s;ent, is the real, if not the only Ground of the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Pre&s;s. When I am told the pre&s;ent Liberty of the Pre&s;s is a Grievance, I mu&s;t &s;ay, the rea&s;on is plain, 'tis becau&s;e there is a Liberty, and no Law to a&s;certain the Fact. But let the Law adju&s;t the Crime, and tie it to the Penalty, that Authors may know what to tru&s;t to; there needs no Licen&s;er to pick Men's Pockets, permit Crimes when he is paid for them, and refu&s;e  u&s;eful and valuable Books if he is not fee'd.</P>
<P>But here remains a Que&s;tion unan&s;wer'd, that in o|ther Ca&s;es is not u&s;ual. There are many ways to com|mit this Crime, and lie conceal'd; the Crime may be committed, and the Malefactor hard to be found, and therefore the Licen&s;ing the Pre&s;s was thought nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the Fact, becau&s;e when committed, the Offender is not ea&s;ily brought to Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>This is ea&s;ily an&s;wered, and the Parliament has thought fit, in two Ca&s;es, to make a Precedent that ex|actly reaches the Ca&s;e, and they are, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> in the Ca&s;e of buying &s;tolen Goods; and the other is, in putting off, or exchanging counterfeit Money; both which, tho' Ac|ce&s;&s;aries to the Crime, are now made equally Criminal with the Principal, if knowingly done.</P>
<P>If in the Ca&s;e of the Pre&s;s, a Law be made to make the la&s;t Seller the Author, unle&s;s the Name of Author, Printer, or Book&s;eller, be affix'd to the Book, then no Book can be publi&s;hed, but there will be &s;ome body found to an&s;wer for it. Whoever puts a fal&s;e Name, to forfeit..... <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
Nor can this be thought hard upon the Seller of the Book, becau&s;e as he knows the Con&s;equence, no Book|&s;eller will be &s;o fooli&s;h as to &s;ell any Book that has not the Name of &s;ome Printer, Book&s;eller, or Author affix'd to the Title; and &s;o this Law will an&s;wer two Ends to|gether; be a means to prevent the Crime, and fix the Offender if it be committed.</P>
<P>If the Name of the Author, or of the Printer, or of the Book&s;eller, for whom it is printed, be affix'd, eve|ry Man is &s;afe that &s;ells a Book; but if not, then no Man will &s;ell it, but he that hath &s;ome private Rea&s;on for propagating what the Book treats of, and &s;uch a Man has &s;ome Title to pa&s;s for the Author.</P>
<P>I place the Excellency of a Law very much, as before, in the Power and Efficacy it has to prevent the Crime; and the Ju&s;tice of that Law can never be plainer, than when the Fact is a&s;certain'd, the Penalty &s;ettled, and the Criminal de&s;crib'd: No Man can then be Guilty, but he that is wilfully and knowingly &s;o, and who|ever is &s;o, <HI>let him &s;uffer,</HI> no Man will be concern'd for him.</P>
<P>All the Excu&s;e that ever I could meet with for a Li|cen&s;er, was built upon the Difficulty of di&s;covering the true Author of a Book, and the Difficulty being &s;uch, that no Laws could ea&s;ily be made effectual, to fix the Writer of any thing, they found room for the Strata|gem of a Licen&s;er. I call it an Excu&s;e for it, becau&s;e 'tis plain, the Licen&s;er was not found out as a Remedy for the Evil: But the De&s;ign of a Licen&s;er being fir&s;t re&s;olv'd on, the pretended Difficulty was made a Handle to introduce the new Engine into the World, and place this Monarch of the Pre&s;s, as a Tyrant to exerci&s;e his ab&s;olute Authority over the World of Letters, and &s;o &s;uppre&s;s one Mi&s;chief by another,</P>
<P>But leaving the Pre&s;s in the full Enjoyment of all its ju&s;t Liberties, and an&s;wer all the&s;e Ends, while 'tis yet fenc'd
<PB N="18" REF="20">
about with due Re&s;triction of Laws, every Man may have a full Freedom of promoting the Extent of Learn|ing, exerci&s;ing his Parts, defending his Arguments, and an&s;wering his Adver&s;ary, and yet at the &s;ame time will know how far he may go with &s;afety, and when he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es: If any Man then gives offence, he knows it, and what he mu&s;t expect; if any Man does thus of|fend, the Law knows the Offender, and how to puni&s;h him: All things would run in the open free Cour&s;e of Laws. Criminals and Laws. Offences and Puni&s;hment are due Oppo&s;ites, and ought always to &s;tand in view of one another. If the Puni&s;hment or the Law is conceal'd from the Offender, he is trapann'd into the Crime to his De&s;truction, when he knows nothing of the Matter, and the Law is made a Gin or Snare to hook him into Puni&s;hment, which is contrary to the Nature of Laws, and the Practice of all ju&s;t Governments.</P>
<P>A Law therefore to &s;ettle what an Author may or may not do, to bring the Offences of the Pen to a Regu|lation, and then to annex the Puni&s;hment to the Crime, would bring all this Matter to a Square.</P>
<P>Authors would be known as &s;oon as the Book, becau&s;e this Law would oblige the Printer or Book&s;eller to place the Author's Name in the Title, or him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Nor is it the &s;mall Advantage of this Law, to have the Puni&s;hment of Authors adju&s;ted; for I know no|thing in which our Laws have been executed with a greater Irregularity, no Crime has been puni&s;h'd with &s;uch improper Puni&s;hments, &s;uch arbitrary Latitude, or &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tent Variety. In other Ca&s;es we have Crimes and Puni&s;hments link'd together; if a Man robs a Hou&s;e, counterfeits the Coin, or kills a Man, he knows what he has to tru&s;t to, but Authors have never known their Puni&s;hment: We have had the very &s;ame Crime puni&s;h'd with trifling Fines of Twenty Shillings, and
<PB N="19" REF="21">
exorbitant Fines of a Thou&s;and Marks, and yet the Twenty-Shilling-Man hath the greate&s;t Guilt: writing of a Book has been puni&s;h'd with <HI>Fines, Whippings, Pil|lories, Impri&s;onment for Life, Halters and Axes:</HI> How 'tis po&s;&s;ible the Guilt of the Pen can extend to merit all the&s;e &s;everal Penalties, is a thing I never met with a Lawyer yet that could re&s;olve.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be &s;omething el&s;e than Law in the Ca&s;e; when I &s;hall commit an Offence, and be fin'd 20 Mark, or perhaps le&s;s; another, for the &s;ame Crime, &s;hall not be pro&s;ecuted at all; another hang'd or beheaded.</P>
<P>All the World cannot &s;hew me a Crime puni&s;hed by &s;uch unequal Variety, where the Crime is the &s;ame in Kind, and can only differ in Circum&s;tances; nor is it po&s;&s;ible tho&s;e Circum&s;tances can have &s;o much Variety, &s;uch unu&s;ual Di&s;tance in their Nature, as there has been in the Puni&s;hments; but all this comes from the Law having left the Puni&s;hment un&s;ettled, and plac'd it in the unlimited Judgments of Men.</P>
<P>This Law would al&s;o put a Stop to a certain &s;ort of Thieving which is now in full practice in <HI>England,</HI> and which no Law extends to puni&s;h, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ome Printers and Book&s;ellers printing Copies none of their own.</P>
<P>This is really a mo&s;t injurious piece of Violence, and a Grievance to all Mankind; for it not only robs their Neighbour of their ju&s;t Right, but it robs Men of the due Reward of Indu&s;try, the Prize of Learning, and the Benefit of their Studies; in the next Place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> robs the Reader, by printing Copies of other Men uncorrect and imperfect, making &s;urreptitious and &s;purious Col|lections, and innumerable Errors, by which the De&s;ign of the Author is often inverted, conceal'd, or de&s;troy'd, and the Information the World would reap by a curi|ous and well &s;tudied Di&s;cour&s;e, is dwindled into Con|fu&s;ion and Non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
'Twere endle&s;s to in&s;tance in the Mi&s;chiefs which have been done of this kind. An Author prints a Book, whether on a Civil or Religious Subject, Philo&s;ophy, Hi&s;tory, or any Subject, if it be a large Volume, it &s;hall be immediately <HI>abridg'd</HI> by &s;ome mercenary Book|&s;eller, employing a Hackney-writer, who &s;hall give &s;uch a contrary Turn to the Sen&s;e, &s;uch a fal&s;e Idea of the De&s;ign, and &s;o huddle Matters of the greate&s;t Con|&s;equence together in abrupt Generals, that no greater Wrong can be done to the Subject; thus the &s;ale of a Volume of twenty Shillings is &s;poil'd, by per&s;wading People that the Sub&s;tance of the Book is contain'd in the Summary  of 4<HI>s.</HI> price, the Undertaker is ruin'd, the Reader impos'd upon, and the Author's perhaps 20 Years Labour lo&s;t and undervalued: I refer my Reader, for the Truth of this, to the &s;everal Abridgments of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, <HI>Jo&s;ephus, Baxter</HI>'s Life, and the like.</P>
<P>I think in Ju&s;tice, no Man has a Right to make any Abridgment of a Book, but the Proprietor of the Book; and I am &s;ure no Man can be &s;o well qualified for the doing it, as the Author, if alive, becau&s;e no Man can be capable of knowing the true Sen&s;e of the De&s;ign, or of giving it a due Turn like him that compos'd it.</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t Sort of the Pre&s;s-Piracy, the next is pirating Books in &s;maller Print, and meaner Paper, in order to &s;ell them lower than the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion. Thus as &s;oon as a Book is publi&s;h'd by the Author, a raskally Fellow buys it, and immediately falls to work upon it, and if it was a Book of a Crown, he will contract it &s;o as to &s;ell it for two Shillings, a Book of three Shill|ings for one Shilling, a Pamphlet of a Shilling, for 2<HI>d.</HI> a Six-penny Book in a penny Sheet, and the like.

<P>The Law we are upon, effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;es this mo&s;t villainous Practice, for every Author being o|blig'd to &s;et his Name to the Book he writes, has, by this Law, an undoubted exclu&s;ive Right to the Property of it. The Clau&s;e in the Law is a Patent to the Author, and &s;ettles the Propriety of the Work wholly in him&s;elf, or in &s;uch to whom he &s;hall a&s;&s;ign it; and 'tis rea&s;onable it &s;hould be &s;o: For if an Author has not the right of a Book, after he has made it, and the benefit be not his own, and the Law will not protect him in that Benefit, 'twould be very hard the Law &s;hould pretend to puni&s;h him for it.</P>
<P>'Twould be unaccountably &s;evere, to make a Man an&s;werable for the Mi&s;carriages of a thing which he &s;hall not reap the benefit of if well perform'd; there is no Law &s;o much wanting in the Nation, relating to Trade and Civil Property, as this, nor is there a greater Abu&s;e in any Civil Employment, than the printing of other Mens Copies, every jot as unju&s;t as lying wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">h their Wives, and breaking-up their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>This Grievance a Licen&s;er will never remedy; nay the&s;e People who act them in &s;ecret, and without Principles, are out of the reach of a Licen&s;er, for they value not the Law, are <HI>unaccountable them&s;elves,</HI> and have their Hawkers and Mannagers under them.</P>
<P>But if an Author has a Right of Action given him by Law, not again&s;t him only who &s;hall print his Copy, but again&s;t the Publi&s;her of it al&s;o; and this Law being made full and expre&s;s, the Evil will die, for no body will dare to &s;ell the Book, when the vi|lainous Pirate has fini&s;h'd the Impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
