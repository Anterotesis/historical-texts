<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;eems to be a kind of duty incumbent on tho&s;e who devote them&s;elves to Poetry, to rai&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, the dignity of a declining Art, by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Compo&s;ition, and the character of modern Times will allow: The ages, in|deed, are pa&s;t, in which the &s;ong of the Poet was idoli|zed for its <HI>miraculous effects;</HI> yet a Poem, intended to promote the cultivation of good-humour, may &s;till perhaps be fortunate enough to prove of &s;ome little &s;er|vice to &s;ociety in general; or, if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by &s;ober Rea&s;on, it is at lea&s;t one of tho&s;e plea&s;ing and innocent delu|&s;ions, in which a poetical Enthu&s;ia&s;t may be &s;afely indulged.</P>
<P>The following production owes its exi&s;tence to an in|cident in real life, very &s;imilar to the principal action of
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
the la&s;t Canto; but in forming the general plan of the work, it &s;eemed to me ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN, notwith|&s;tanding the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a &s;ubject &s;o happily executed by the ma&s;terly pencil of Pope. I con&s;idered his Cave of Spleen as a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ca|binet picture; and, to avoid the &s;ervility of imitation, I determined to &s;ketch the man&s;ion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canva&s;s: Happy, indeed, if the judg|ment of the Public may enable me to exclaim, with the hone&s;t vanity of the Painter, who compared his own works to the divine productions of Raphael,
<Q>"E &s;on Pittore anch' Io!"</Q></P>
<P>The celebrated Ale&s;&s;andro Ta&s;&s;oni, who is generally con&s;idered as the inventor of the modern Heroi-comic Poetry, was &s;o proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of compo&s;ition, that he not only &s;poke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters, but even gave a MS. copy of his work to his native city of Modena, with an in&s;cription, in which he &s;tiled it a new &s;pecies of Poetry, invented by him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6">
A few partial friends have a&s;&s;erted, that the pre&s;ent performance has &s;ome degree of &s;imilar merit; but as I apprehend all the novelty it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, may rather require an apology, than entitle its Author to challenge commen|dation, I &s;hall explain how far the conduct of the Po|em differs from the mo&s;t approved models in this mode of writing, and &s;lightly mention the poetical effects, which &s;uch a variation appeared likely to produce.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the favourite Poems, which blend the &s;erious and the comic, repre&s;ent their principal characters in a &s;atirical point of view: It was the in|tention of Ta&s;&s;oni (though prudence made him attempt to conceal it) to &s;atirize a particular Italian Noble|man, who happened to be the object of his re&s;entment. Boileau openly ridicules the French Eccle&s;ia&s;tics in his Lutrin; Garth, our Engli&s;h Phy&s;icians, in his Di&s;|pen&s;ary; and the Rape of the Lock it&s;elf, that mo&s;t ex|cellent and enchanting Poem, which I never contem|plate but with new idolatry, is denominated <HI>the be&s;t Satire extant,</HI> by the learned Dr. Warton, in his very clegant and ingenious, but &s;evere E&s;&s;ay on Pope: A &s;entence which &s;eems to be confirmed by the Poet him&s;elf, in his letter to Mrs. Fermor, where he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the cha|racter
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
of Belinda, as it is now managed, re&s;embles you in nothing but in beauty."</Q> Though I think, that no compo&s;ition can &s;urpa&s;s, or perhaps ever equal this mo&s;t happy effort of Genius, as a &s;portive Satire, I ima|gined it might be po&s;&s;ible to give a new Character to this mixed &s;pecies of Poetry, and to render it by its Object, though not in its Execution, more noble than the mo&s;t beautiful and refined Satire can be. We have &s;een it carried to inimitable perfection, in the mo&s;t delicate raillery on Female Foibles:&mdash;It remained to be tried, if it might not al&s;o a&s;pire to delineate the more engaging features of Female Excellence. The idea appeared to me worth the experiment; for, if it &s;ucceeded, it &s;eemed to promi&s;e a double advantage; fir&s;t, it would give an air of novelty to the Poem; and, &s;econdly, what I thought of much greater importance, it would render it more intere&s;ting to the heart. On the&s;e principles, I have endeavoured to paint <HI>SERENA</HI> as a mo&s;t lovely, en|gaging, and accompli&s;hed character; yet I hope the co|louring is &s;o faithfully copied from <HI>general Nature,</HI> that every man, who reads the Poem, may be happy enough to know many Fair ones, who re&s;emble my Heroine.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="8">
There is another point, in which I have al&s;o at|tempted to give this Poem an air of novelty: I mean, the manner of connecting the real and the vi&s;ionary &s;cenes, which compo&s;e it; by &s;hifting the&s;e in alternate Cantos, I hoped to make familiar Incident and allego|rical Picture afford a &s;trong relief to each other, and keep the attention of the Reader alive, by an appear|ance particularly diver&s;ified. I wi&s;hed, indeed (but I fear mo&s;t ineffectually) for powers to unite &s;ome touches of the &s;portive wildne&s;s of Ario&s;to, and the more &s;eri|ous &s;ublime painting of Dante, with &s;ome portion of the enchanting elegance, the refined imagination, and the moral graces of Pope; and to do this, if po&s;&s;ible, with|out violating tho&s;e rules of propriety, which Mr. Cam|bridge has illu&s;trated, by example as well as precept, in The Scribleriad, and in his &s;en&s;ible Preface to that ele|gant and learned Poem.</P>
<P>I have now very frankly informed my Reader of the <HI>extent,</HI> or rather of the <HI>extravagance</HI> of my de&s;ire; for I will not give it the &s;erious name of <HI>de&s;ign:</HI> They, whom an enlightened ta&s;te has rendered thoroughly &s;en|&s;ible how very difficult it mu&s;t be to accompli&s;h &s;uch an idea, will not only be the fir&s;t to di&s;cern, but the mo&s;t
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
ready to pardon tho&s;e errors, into which &s;o hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me. I had thoughts of introducing this performance to the Public, by a Di&s;&s;ertation of con&s;iderable length on this &s;pecies of Poetry; but I forbear to indulge my&s;elf any farther in &s;uch preliminary remarks, as the anxiety of authors is &s;o apt to produce, from the reflection, that, however ingeniou&s;ly written, they add little or nothing to the &s;ucce&s;s of a good Poem, and are utterly in&s;ufficient to prevent that neglect, or oblivion, which is the inevitable fate of a bad one.</P>
<P>In di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a work to my Fair Readers, which is intended principally for their peru&s;al, I &s;hall only re|commend it to their attention; and bid them farewell, in the words of the plea&s;ant and courteous Ta&s;&s;oni&mdash; <Q><L>"Vaglia il buon voler, s' altro non lice,</L>
<L>"E chi la leggera, viva felice!"</L></Q></P>

And, indeed, when I reflect on the inimitable talents, the public &s;pirit, and the charitable in&s;titutions of Swift, I am almo&s;t ready to addre&s;s his Spirit with this humilia|ting apo&s;trophe:
<Q>"I confe&s;s that I have done thee wrong."&mdash;</Q>
But a &s;uperior attention to the intere&s;t of &s;ociety inclines me to per&s;evere in a very different &s;entiment, and &s;till to think, that no talents, no virtues in a writer, can properly exempt even the mo&s;t brilliant work from &s;e|vere reprehen&s;ion, when, in&s;tead of improving, it has an evident tendency to deba&s;e and vilify human nature&mdash;a tendency, that I con&s;ider as mo&s;t evident in the compo&s;ition to which I have alluded:&mdash;if I am wrong in this idea, I may yet &s;helter my&s;elf under the authority of two mo&s;t honourable names&mdash;a moral Poet of a ge|nerous and exalted &s;pirit, and a learned Critic of in|finite candour and di&s;cernment.&mdash;In Young's E&s;&s;ay on Original Compo&s;ition, and in the po&s;thumous work ju&s;t bequeathed to the public by the lamented Mr. Harris, the mi&s;anthropy of Swift is mo&s;t warmly cen&s;ured. The words of the latter are &s;o &s;triking and appo&s;ite, that I cannot wi&s;h for a &s;tronger ju&s;tification. <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;anthropy is &s;o dangerous a thing, and goes &s;o far in &s;apping the very foundations of Morality and Reli|gion, that I e&s;teem the la&s;t part of Swift's Gulliver (that I mean relative to his Houyhnhnms and Yahoos) to be a wor&s;e book to peru&s;e, than tho&s;e which we for|bid, as the mo&s;t flagitious and ob&s;cene. One ab&s;urdity in this Author (a wretched Philo&s;opher though a great Wit) is well worth remarking&mdash;in order to render the nature of Man odious, and the nature of Bea&s;ts ami|able, he is compelled to give human characters to his Bea&s;ts, and bea&s;tly characters to his Men; &s;o that we are to admire the Bea&s;ts, not for being Bea&s;ts, but amiable Men; and to dete&s;t the Men, not for being Men, but dete&s;table Bea&s;ts."</Q> <BIBL>HARRIS's Philological Enquiries, vol. ii. page 538.</BIBL></NOTE></L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the following Plays were intended only for a pri|vate theatre, I have been tempted by that circum|&s;tance to introduce a kind of novelty into our language, by writing three comedies in rhyme, though the Comic Mu&s;e of our country has been long accu&s;tomed to expre&s;s her&s;elf in pro&s;e, and her cu&s;tom has the &s;anction of &s;et|tled precept, and &s;ucce&s;sful example. The Antiquarian, indeed, may remind me that Gammer Gurton's Needle, one of the earlie&s;t of our old plays, with other comic productions of that rude period, was written in rhyme; and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome fa&s;tidious enemies of that Gothic jin|gle, as they affect to call it, may con&s;ider the pre&s;ent Publication as nothing more than a relap&s;e into the mo&s;t barbarous mode of dramatic compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>For the boldne&s;s of an attempt, which has no modern precedent to plead in its behalf, &s;ome apology may be due to the Public.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I beg it may not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that by writing a comedy in rhyme, I mean to convey an in|direct
<PB N="168" REF="173">
cen&s;ure on the contrary practice. No one can prize more highly than I do the many excellent comedies in pro&s;e, with which our language is enriched. I am very far from entertaining a wi&s;h to overturn the cere|monial which the Comic Mu&s;e of England has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; but I hope to find our country as much a friend to toleration in the forms of literature, as in tho&s;e of re|ligion. The cu&s;tom of other enlightened nations, both ancient and modern, may be pleaded on this occa&s;ion in behalf of ver&s;e. Ari&s;tophanes, in his play of the Clouds, &s;eems to pride him&s;elf on his poetry. Ario&s;to having written two comedies in pro&s;e, converted them both into metre at a maturer period of his life; and Moliere, the unrivalled ma&s;ter of the French comie theatre, who has written admirably both in pro&s;e and rhyme, is, I think, mo&s;t admirable, and mo&s;t truly comic, when he adheres to the latter.</P>
<P>To the author who attempts a comedy in Engli&s;h rhyme, our language &s;eems to offer an advantage, which the French poet did not enjoy. The Comic Mu&s;e of France has chiefly confined her&s;elf to that &s;tructure of ver&s;e, which belongs equally to her Tragic Si&s;ter. In the poetry of our nation, this particular mea&s;ure is ap|propriated to &s;portive &s;ubjects, and though hitherto not u&s;ed in Comedy, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es to an Engli&s;h ear a very co|mic vivacity. That it is highly calculated for poems of wit and humour, we have a &s;triking proof in that
<PB N="169" REF="174">
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite production the Bath Guide. How far it may &s;ucceed through the varied &s;cenes of an Engli&s;h play, experiment only can determine. As &s;ome rea|ders, on the fir&s;t &s;ight of a comedy in rhyme, may ha&s;|tily &s;uppo&s;e that the fa&s;hion and the materials of the work are borrowed from the Theatre of France, I think it proper to declare, in ju&s;tice to the writers of that country, that they are by no means an&s;werable for any defects which may be found in the&s;e dramatic per|formances. I am not con&s;cious of having borrowed a &s;ingle character or &s;ituation from any comic writer what|ever, either foreign or dome&s;tic.&mdash;The fir&s;t of the three comedies, contained in the pre&s;ent Publication, was founded on a real anecdote related to me by an intimate friend, who, concealing the names of the par|ties, mentioned their ludicrous adventure as a new and tempting &s;ubject for the Comic Mu&s;e.&mdash;The plan of the &s;econd aro&s;e in the mind of its author, from his re|marking the various effects of Connoi&s;&s;eur&s;hip in diffe|rent characters. An attachment to the fine arts, which is allowed to refine and &s;trengthen the virtues of a manly and a generous &s;pirit, has perhaps a peculiar ten|dency not only to &s;hew, but to increa&s;e the narrowne&s;s of a vain and feeble mind; and if &s;uch a tendency exi&s;ts, it is the province of a comic writer to counteract and correct it.&mdash;The aim of the third comedy in this col|lection is to laugh at two di&s;tinct &s;pecies of affectation,
<PB N="170" REF="175">
very prevalent in our age and country; the affectation of refined &s;entiment, and the affectation of pompous and pedantic expre&s;&s;ion. I prote&s;t however again&s;t per&s;onal application: and, to guard again&s;t it, let me declare, that this ridicule is levelled, not at the great and re&s;pectable Veteran in the field of literature, who&s;e phra&s;es may &s;ometimes be borrowed by a character in the play; but at the namele&s;s and &s;ervile herd of his awkward imitators.&mdash;Vigor and originality of thought give a &s;anction to the pomp and peculiarity of his lan|guage. If &s;ingularities of &s;tyle are united with genius and moral excellence, they are properly regarded with a partial re&s;pect; but when the&s;e &s;ingularities are pre|po&s;terou&s;ly copied, and &s;eem to prevail as a fa&s;hion, they become, I apprehend, very fair &s;ubjects of &s;portive &s;atire.</P>
<P>When I reflect what long and e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudice a rhyming play mu&s;t encounter&mdash;when I remember that even Dryden him&s;elf, the mo&s;t able advocate, and the greate&s;t ma&s;ter of rhyme in our language, has expre&s;sly condemned the u&s;e of it in comedy&mdash;I am alarmed at the hardine&s;s of my attempt; but when I recollect that time, the mo&s;t infallible te&s;t of literary opinion, has fully &s;hewn the mi&s;take of that immortal Poet, in re|commending the u&s;e of rhyme in Engli&s;h Tragedy, I am inclined to hope that he might be equally mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing it utterly un&s;uited to our Comic Mu&s;e. It may be urged indeed, with great truth, that a comedy
<PB N="171" REF="176">
in rhyme cannot be &s;o clo&s;e a copy of Nature as a co|medy in pro&s;e, the latter adhering to the very language of common life. But from a &s;i&s;ter-art we may borrow, at lea&s;t a plau&s;ible argument in favour of Poetry, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The great ma&s;ter, who has de&s;canted &s;o happily on the principles of Painting, ob&s;erves with great propriety, in one of his di&s;cour&s;es, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we are not always plea&s;ed with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute po&s;&s;ible re|&s;emblance of an imitation to its original object: ca&s;es may exi&s;t, in which &s;uch a re&s;emblance may be even di&s;agreeable. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the effect of figures in wax-work, though certainly a more exact repre&s;entation than can be given by painting or &s;culp|ture, is a &s;ufficient proof that the plea&s;ure we receive from imitation is not increa&s;ed merely in proportion as it approaches to minute and detailed reality: we are plea&s;ed, on the contrary, by &s;eeing ends an&s;wered by &s;eeming inadequate means<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds' Di&s;cour&s;e of December 1782.</NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;On the&s;e prin|ciples, which perhaps are equally ju&s;t in the two kindred arts, a comedy in Rhyme may be &s;till more entertaining than a comedy, of equal merit in other points, which confines it&s;elf to pro&s;e; and a critic who exclaims again&s;t the unnatural effect of a rhyming dialogue, may as ju&s;tly cen&s;ure a portrait on canva&s;s, becau&s;e it is not &s;o exact a copy of life, as an image of coloured wax. In both ca&s;es, the arti&s;t, whether painter or poet, may be
<PB N="172" REF="177">
ju&s;tly called a true and a plea&s;ing copier of Nature, if he pre&s;erves as high a degree of re&s;emblance, as his mode of imitation will admit, and embelli&s;hes his work with the attractive and almo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able graces of ea&s;e, &s;pirit, and freedom.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by Voltaire of theatrical compo&s;ition in general, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tous les genres &s;ont bons hors le genre en|nuyeux."</Q> If the pre&s;ent comedies fall not within the cla&s;s which that lively Writer has &s;o ju&s;tly pro&s;cribed, the Author may be allowed to hope, that his liberal and enlightened readers will look with indulgence on a Pub|lication, which aro&s;e from his wi&s;h to introduce a &s;trik|ing, and he tru&s;ts not a blamable, variety into the amu&s;ements of Engli&s;h literature.</P>

<L>I have long &s;ought in vain for an heir to my mind,</L>
<L>But all my &s;oul wi&s;h'd, in your &s;pirit I find.</L>
<L>You &s;hall <HI>not</HI> rob your friend of a &s;ingle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Indian Coin.</NOTE>Gold Moor,</L>
<L>He can rai&s;e heirs enough to inherit his &s;tore:</L>
<L>To &s;uch men as him&s;elf let him ha&s;te to give birth,</L>
<L>And with twenty young Felix's garni&s;h the earth.</L>
<L>How trifling &s;oever your fortune may be,</L>
<L>From the Colonel's e&s;teem, and the virtues I &s;ee,</L>
<L>I think you as noble a match for my Niece,</L>
<L>As I could, had you brought home a new golden fleece:</L>
<L><PB N="257" REF="262">
I have money enough, if you're rich in affection.&mdash;</L>
<L>As I always have talk'd of an equal connection,</L>
<L>My neighbours, perhaps, may &s;uppo&s;e my &s;ight dim,</L>
<L>Or mock my wi&s;e choice as a generous whim:</L>
<L>Let them &s;tudy with zeal, which I hope may &s;ucceed,</L>
<L>Of their hor&s;es and dogs to improve the be&s;t breed;</L>
<L>A &s;tudy more noble engro&s;&s;es my mind,</L>
<L>To pre&s;erve the fir&s;t points in the breed of mankind:</L>
<L>On the heart and the &s;oul, as the fir&s;t points, I dwell,</L>
<L>In the&s;e, my dear Children, you match mighty well;</L>
<L>And I think human nature in debt to my care,</L>
<L>For uniting two mortals who happily pair.</L>
