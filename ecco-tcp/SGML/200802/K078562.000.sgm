<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO illu&s;trate the following poem, to vin|dicate the &s;ubject from the cen&s;ure of improbability, and to &s;hew by the concurring evidence of the be&s;t hi&s;torians, that &s;uch di&s;intere&s;ted public virtue did once exi&s;t, I have thought, it would not be improper to prefix the &s;ub&s;equent narration.</P>
<P>WHILE Darius, the father of Xerxes, was yet on the throne of Per&s;ia, Cleomenes and Demaratus were kings in Lacedaemon, both de&s;cended from Hercules. Demaratus was un|fortunately expos'd by an uncertain rumour, which render'd his legitimacy &s;u&s;pected, to the
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
malice and treachery of his colleague, who had conceiv'd a per&s;onal re&s;entment again&s;t him; for Cleomenes taking advantage of this report, per&s;uaded the Spartans to examine into the birth of Demaratus, and refer the difficulty to the oracle of Delphi; and was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his perfidious de&s;igns by a near relation of Dema|ratus, nam'd Leotychides, who a&s;pir'd to &s;uc|ceed him in his dignity. Cleomenes found means to corrupt the prie&s;te&s;s of Delphi, who declar'd Demaratus not legitimate. Thus by the ba&s;e practices of his colleague Cleomenes, and his kin&s;man Leotychides, Demaratus was expell'd from his office of king in the commonwealth, after having frequently &s;ignaliz'd his valour in its &s;ervice. He went into voluntary bani&s;h|ment, and retiring to A&s;ia was there protected by Darius; while Leotychides &s;ucceeded to the regal authority in Sparta. Upon the death of Cleomenes Leonidas was made king, who rul'd in conjunction with this Leotychides, when Xerxes, the &s;on of Darius, invaded Greece. The
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
number of land and naval forces, which accom|panied that monarch, together with the &s;ervants, women, and other u&s;ual attendants on the army of an ea&s;tern prince, amounted to upwards of five millions, as reported by Herodotus, who wrote within a few years after the event, and pub|licly recited his hi&s;tory at the Olympic games. In this general a&s;&s;embly not only from Greece it&s;elf, but from every part of the world, where|ever a colony of Grecians was planted, had he greatly exceeded the truth, he mu&s;t certainly have been detected, and cen&s;ur'd by &s;ome a|mong &s;o great a multitude, and &s;uch a vo|luntary fal&s;hood mu&s;t have entirely de&s;troy'd that merit and authority, which have procur'd to Herodotus the veneration of all po&s;terity, with the appellation of the father of hi&s;tory. On the fir&s;t news of this attempt upon their li|berty a convention was immediately held at the I&s;thmus of Corinth, compos'd of deputies from the &s;everal &s;tates of Greece, to con&s;ult on proper mea&s;ures for the public &s;afety. The Spartans
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
al&s;o &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to enquire of the oracle at Delphi into the event of the war, who return'd with an an&s;wer from the prie&s;te&s;s of Apollo, that either a king de&s;cended from Hercules mu&s;t die, or Lacedaemon would be entirely de|&s;troy'd. Leonidas immediately offer'd to &s;a|crifice his life for the &s;afety of Lacedaemon, and marching to Thermopylae po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of that important pa&s;s with three hundred of his countrymen; who with the forces of &s;ome o|ther cities in the Peloponne&s;us, together with the Thebans, The&s;pians, and the troops of tho&s;e &s;tates, which adjoin'd to Thermopylae, compos'd an army of near eight thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>XERXES was now advanc'd as far, as The&s;&s;alia; when hearing, that a &s;mall body of Grecians was a&s;&s;embled at Thermopylae, with &s;ome Lacedaemonians at their head, and among the re&s;t Leonidas, a de&s;cendant of Hercules, he di&s;patch'd a &s;ingle hor&s;eman before to ob|&s;erve
<PB N="v" REF="7">
their numbers, and di&s;cover their de&s;igns. When this hor&s;eman approach'd, he could not take a view of the whole camp, which lay con|ceal'd behind a rampart formerly rais'd by the Phocians at the entrance of Thermopylae; &s;o that his whole attention was employ'd on tho&s;e, who were on guard before the wall, and who at that in&s;tant chanc'd to be the Lacedaemo|nians. Their manner and ge&s;tures greatly a&s;|toni&s;h'd the Per&s;ian; &s;ome were amu&s;ing them|&s;elves in gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es; others were comb|ing their hair; and all di&s;cover'd a total di&s;regard of him, whom they &s;uffer'd to depart without mole&s;tation, and report to Xerxes, what he had &s;een: which appearing to that prince quite ri|diculous, he &s;ent for Demaratus, who was with him in the camp, and requir'd him to ex|plain this &s;trange behaviour of his countrymen. Demaratus inform'd him, that it was a cu&s;tom among the Spartans to comb down and ad|ju&s;t their hair, when they were determin'd to fight till the la&s;t extremity. Xerxes notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
in the confidence of his power &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;adors to the Grecians to demand their arms, to bid them di&s;per&s;e, and become his friends and allies; which propo&s;als being receiv'd with di&s;|dain, he commanded the Medes and Saces to &s;eize on the Grecians, and bring them alive into his pre&s;ence. The&s;e nations immediately at|tack'd the Grecians, and were &s;oon repuls'd with great &s;laughter; fre&s;h troops &s;till &s;ucceed|ed, but with no better fortune than the fir&s;t, being oppos'd to an enemy not only &s;uperiour in valour and re&s;olution, but who had the ad|vantage of di&s;cipline, and were furni&s;h'd with better arms both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH in his Laconic apothegms re|ports, that the Per&s;ian king offer'd to inve&s;t Leonidas with the &s;overeignty of all Greece, provided he would join his arms to tho&s;e of Per|&s;ia. This offer was too con&s;iderable a conde|&s;cen&s;ion to have been made before a tryal of their force, and mu&s;t therefore have been propos'd by
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
Xerxes, after &s;uch a &s;eries of ill &s;ucce&s;s, as might probably have depre&s;s'd the in&s;olence of his temper; and it may be ea&s;ily &s;uppos'd, that the virtue of Leonidas was proof again&s;t any temptations of that nature. Whether this be a fact, or not, thus much is certain, that Xerxes was reduc'd to extreme difficulties by this re&s;o|lute defence of Thermopylae; till he was extri|cated from his di&s;tre&s;s by a Malian nam'd Epi|altes, who conducted twenty thou&s;and of the Per&s;ian army into Greece through a pa&s;s, which lay higher up the country among the mountains of Oeta: whereas the pa&s;&s;age at Thermopylae was &s;ituated on the &s;ea-&s;hore between the end of tho&s;e mountains and the Malian bay. The de|fence of the upper pa&s;s had been committed to a thou&s;and Phocians, who upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of the enemy incon&s;iderately abandon'd their &s;tation, and put them&s;elves in array upon a neighbouring eminence; but the Per&s;ians wi&s;ely avoided an engagement, and with the utmo&s;t expedition march'd to Thermopylae. Leonidas
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
no &s;ooner receiv'd information, that the Barba|rians had pa&s;s'd the mountains, but he command|ed the allies to retreat, re&s;erving the three hundred Spartans, and four hundred Thebans, whom, as they follow'd him with reluctance at fir&s;t, he now compell'd to &s;tay. But the The&s;pians, who&s;e number amounted to &s;even hundred, would not be per&s;uaded by Leonidas to for&s;ake him. Their commander was Demophilus, and the mo&s;t eminent among&s;t them for his va|lour was Dithyrambus. Among the Spartans the mo&s;t con&s;picuous next to Leonidas was Di|eneces, who being told, that the multitude of Per&s;ian arrows would ob&s;cure the &s;un, replied, the battle would then be in the &s;hade. Two bro|thers named Alpheus and Maron are al&s;o record|ed for their valour, and were Lacedaemonians. Megi&s;tias a prie&s;t, by birth an Acarnanian, re|fus'd to de&s;ert Leonidas, though intreated by him to con&s;ult his &s;afety, and retire; but &s;ent away his only &s;on, and remain'd him&s;elf be|hind to die with the Lacedaemonians. Among
<PB N="ix" REF="11">
the three hundred Spartans were two call'd Eurytus and Ari&s;todemus, who being almo&s;t blind were di&s;mi&s;s'd by Leonidas. Of the&s;e Ari&s;todemus return'd home; but Eurytus wait|ed, till the Per&s;ians de&s;cended from the hills, and then commanding his &s;lave to lead him a|mong the combatants was &s;lain with the re&s;t of his countrymen.</P>
<P>HERODOTUS relates, that Leonidas drew up his men in the broade&s;t part of Thermopy|lae; where, being &s;urrounded by the Per&s;ians, they fell with great numbers of their ene|mies: but Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, and o|thers affirm, that the Grecians attack'd the ve|ry camp of Xerxes in the night. The action is thus de&s;crib'd by Diodorus. <Q REND="margQuotes">"The Grecians having now rejected all thoughts of &s;afety, preferring glory to life, unanimou&s;ly call'd on their general to lead them again&s;t the Per|&s;ians, before they could be appris'd, that their friends had pa&s;s'd round the mountains.
<PB N="x" REF="12">
Leonidas embrac'd the occa&s;ion, which the ready zeal of his &s;oldiers afforded, and com|manded them forthwith to dine, as men, who were to &s;up in Ely&s;ium. Him&s;elf in con&s;e|quence of this command took a repa&s;t, as the means to furni&s;h &s;trength for a long continuance, and to give per&s;everance in danger. After a &s;hort refre&s;hment the Gre|cians were now prepar'd, and receiv'd orders to a&s;&s;ail the enemies camp, to put all, they met, to the &s;word, and force a pa&s;&s;age to the royal pavilion; when, form'd into one compact body with Leonidas him&s;elf at their head, they march'd again&s;t the Per&s;ians, and enter'd their camp at the dead of night. The Barbarians wholly unprepar'd, and blindly conjecturing, that their friends were defeat|ed, and them&s;elves attack'd by the united power of Greece, hurry together from their tents with the utmo&s;t di&s;order and con&s;terna|tion. Many were &s;lain by Leonidas and his party, but much greater multitudes by their
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
own troops, to whom in the mid&s;t of this blind confu&s;ion they were not di&s;tingui&s;hable from enemies: for as night took away the power of di&s;cerning truely, and the tumult was &s;pread univer&s;ally over the camp, a pro|digious &s;laughter mu&s;t naturally en&s;ue. The want of command, of a watch-word, and of confidence in them&s;elves reduc'd the Per&s;ians to &s;uch a &s;tate of confu&s;ion, that they de|&s;troy'd each other without di&s;tinction. Had Xerxes continu'd in the royal pavilion, the Grecians without difficulty might have brought the war to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion by his death; but he at the beginning of the tumult betook him&s;elf to flight with the ut|mo&s;t precipitation; when the Grecians ru&s;h|ing into the tent, put to the &s;word mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who were left behind: then, while night la&s;ted, they rang'd through the whole camp in diligent &s;earch of the tyrant. When morning appear'd, the Per&s;ians perceiving the true &s;tate of things, held the incon&s;iderable
<PB N="xii" REF="14">
number of their enemies in contempt; yet were &s;o terrified at their valour, that they avoided a near engagement; but inclo&s;ing the Grecians on every &s;ide &s;hower'd their darts and arrows upon them at a di&s;tance, and in the end de&s;troy'd their whole body. Such was the pe|riod of their lives, who under the conduct of Leonidas defended the pa&s;s of Thermopy|lae. Who can refrain from admiring the virtue of the&s;e men, who with one con&s;ent maintaining the po&s;t allotted by their country chearfully renounc'd their lives for the com|mon &s;afety of Greece, and e&s;teem'd a glori|ous death more eligible than to live with di&s;|honour? Nor is the con&s;ternation of the Per&s;ians incredible. Who among tho&s;e Bar|barians could have conjectur'd &s;uch an event? who could have expected, that five hundred men would have dar'd to attack a million? Wherefore &s;hall not all po&s;terity from that day reflect on the virtue of the&s;e men as the object of imitation, who, though the lo&s;s of
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">
their lives was the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of their undertaking, were yet unconquer'd in their &s;pirit; and among all the great names deliver'd down to remembrance are the only heroes, who obtain'd more glory in their fall than others from the brighte&s;t victories? With ju&s;tice may they be deem'd the pre|&s;ervers of the Grecian liberty, even prefer|ably to tho&s;e, who were conquerors in the battles fought afterwards with Xerxes; for the memory of their valour, who fell at Thermopylae, for ever dejected the Barbarians, while the Greeks were fir'd with emulation to equal &s;uch a pitch of magnanimity. Upon the whole there never were any before the&s;e, who attain'd to immortality through the meer exce&s;s of virtue; whence the prai&s;e of their fortitude has not been recorded by hi|&s;torians only, but has been celebrated by numbers of poets, among others by Simoni|des the lyric."</Q></P>

PAUSANIAS in his Laconics con&s;iders the defence of Thermopylae, as an action &s;uperior to any atchiev'd by their cotemporaries, and to all the exploits of preceding ages. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Never (&s;ays he) had Xerxes beheld Greece, or laid in a&s;hes the city of Athens, had not his forces under Hydarnes been conducted through a path over Oeta, and by that means incom|pa&s;&s;ing the Greeks overcome and &s;lain Leo|nidas."</Q> Nor is it improbable, that Leonidas &s;hould have maintain'd his po&s;t in &s;o narrow a pa&s;s, till the whole army of Xerxes had pe|ri&s;h'd by famine.

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Xerxes king of Per&s;ia having drawn together the whole force of his empire, and pa&s;s'd over the Helle&s;pont into Thrace with a de&s;ign to conquer Greece; the deputies from the &s;everal &s;tates of that country, who had &s;ome time before a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves at the I&s;thmus of Corinth to deliberate on proper mea&s;ures for re&s;i&s;ting the invader, were no &s;ooner appris'd of his march into Thrace, than they determin'd without further delay to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age at the &s;traits of Thermopylae, the mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible part of Greece on the &s;ide of Thrace and The&s;&s;aly. Alpheus, one of the deputies from Sparta, repairs to that city, and communicates this re&s;olution to his countrymen; who chanced that day to be a&s;&s;embled in expectation of receiving an an&s;wer from Apollo, to whom they had &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to con&s;ult about the event of the war. Leotychides, one of their two kings, coun&s;els the people to advance no further, than the I&s;thmus of Corinth, which &s;eparates the Peloponne&s;us, where Lacedaemon was &s;ituated, from the re&s;t of Greece; but Leonidas, the other king, di&s;&s;uades them from it. Agis, the me&s;&s;enger, who had
<PB N="2" REF="20">
been deputed to Delphi, and brother to the queen of Leonidas, returns with the oracle; which denounces ruin to the Lacedaemonians, unle&s;s one of their kings lays down his life for the publick. Leonidas offers him&s;elf for the victim. Three hundred Spartans are cho&s;en to accompany him to Thermopylae, and Alpheus returns to the I&s;thmus. Leonidas, after an interview with his queen, departs from Lacedaemon. At the end of &s;ix days, he encamps near the I&s;thmus, when he is join'd by Alpheus; who de&s;cribes the auxiliaries, that wait at the I&s;thmus, tho&s;e, who are already po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Thermopylae, as al&s;o the pa&s;s it&s;elf; and concludes with a relation of the captivity of his brother Polydorus in Per&s;ia.</P>

<HEAD>LEONIDAS. BOOK II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Leonidas, on his approach to the I&s;thmus, is met by the leaders of the troops &s;ent from other Grecian &s;tates, and by the deputies, who com|pos'd the I&s;thmian council. He harangues them, then proceeds in conjunction with the other forces towards Thermopylae; is join'd by Dithyrambus, and arrives at the &s;traits about noon on the fourth day after his departure from the I&s;thmus. He is receiv'd at Thermopylae by the The&s;pian commander Demophilus, and by Anax|ander the Theban treacherou&s;ly recommending Epialtes a Malian, who &s;eeks by a pompous de&s;cription of the Per&s;ian power to intimidate the Grecian leaders, as they are viewing the enemies camp from the top of mount Oeta. He is an&s;wer'd by Dieneces and Diomedon. Xerxes &s;ends Tigranes and Phraortes to the Grecian camp, who are di&s;mi&s;s'd by Leonidas, and conducted back by Dithyrambus and Diomedon; which la&s;t, incens'd with the in&s;olence of Tigranes, treats him with contempt and menaces. This occa&s;ions a challenge to &s;ingle combat between Diomedon and Tigranes, Dithyrambus and Phraortes. Epialtes, after a conference with Anaxander, declares his intention of returning to Xerxes.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Tigranes and Phraortes repair to Xerxes, whom they find &s;eated on a throne &s;urrounded by his &s;atraps in a magnificent pavilion; while the Magi &s;tand before him, and &s;ing an hymn containing the religion of Zoroa&s;tres. Xerxes, notwith&s;tanding the arguments of his brothers Hyperanthes and Abrocomes, gives no credit to the amba&s;&s;adors, who report, that the Grecians are determin'd to maintain the pa&s;s again&s;t him; but commands Demaratus an exil'd king of Sparta to attend him, and a&s;cends his chariot to take a view of the Grecians him&s;elf. He pa&s;&s;es through the mid&s;t of his army, con&s;i&s;ting of many nations differing in arms, cu&s;toms, and manners. He advances to the entrance of the &s;traits, and &s;urpris'd at the behaviour of the Spar|tans demands the rea&s;on of it from Demaratus; which occa&s;ions a conver&s;ation between them on the mercenary forces of Per&s;ia, and the militia of Greece. Demaratus weeping at the fight of his country|men, is comforted by Hyperanthes. Xerxes &s;till incredulous commands Tigranes and Phraortes to bring the Grecians bound before him the next day, and retires to his pavilion.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Leonidas ri&s;ing by break of day commands a body of Arcadians, with the The&s;pians, and Plataeans to be drawn out for battle in that part of Thermopylae, which lay under the Phocian wall, from whence he harangues them. The enemy approaches. Diomedon kills Tigranes in &s;ingle combat. Both armies join battle. Dithyrambus kills Phraortes. The Per&s;ians, entirely defeated, are pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter by Diomedon and Dithyrambus to the extremity of the pa&s;s. The Grecian commanders, after the pur&s;uit retire for refre&s;hment to a cave in the &s;ide of mount Oeta. Leonidas recals them to the camp, and &s;ends down fre&s;h forces. Diomedon, and Dithyrambus, with the Plataeans are permitted to continue in the field. By the advice of Diomedon the Grecians advance to the broade&s;t part of Thermo|pylae, where they form a line of thirty in depth, con&s;i&s;ting of the Plataeans, Mantin&eacute;ans, Tegaeans, Thebans, Corinthians, Phlia&s;ians, and Mycenaeans. The attack is renew'd with great violence by Hy|peranthes, Abrocomes, and the principal Per&s;ian leaders at the head of &s;ome cho&s;en troops.</P>

<P>Hyperanthes di&s;continuing the fight, while he waits for reinforce|ments, Teribazus, a Per&s;ian remarkable for his merit and learning, and highly belov'd by Hyperanthes, but unhappy in his pa&s;&s;ion for Ariana, a daughter of Darius, advances from the re&s;t of the army to the re&s;cue of a friend in di&s;tre&s;s, who lay wounded on the field of battle. Teribazus, is attack'd by Diophantus, the Mantin&eacute;an, whom he overcomes, then engaging with Dithyrambus, is him&s;elf &s;lain. Hype|ranthes ha&s;tens to his &s;uccour.

Hyperanthes and Abrocomes, partly by their own valour, and partly by the perfidy of the Thebans, who de&s;ert the line, being on the point of forcing the Grecians, are repuls'd by the Lacedaemonians.

<HEAD>LEONIDAS. BOOK VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The argument.</HEAD>
<P>Night coming on, the Grecians retire to their tents. A guard is plac'd on the Phocian wall under the command of Agis. He admits into the camp a lady accompanied by a &s;ingle &s;lave, and conducts them to Leonidas; when &s;he di&s;covers her&s;elf to be Ariana, &s;i&s;ter of Xerxes and Hyperanthes, and &s;ues for the body of Teribazus; which being found among the &s;lain, &s;he kills her&s;elf upon it. The &s;lave, who at|tended her, proves to be Polydorus, brother of Alpheus and Maron, and who had been formerly carried into captivity by a Phoenician pirate. He relates before an a&s;&s;embly of the chiefs a me&s;&s;age from Demaratus to the Spartans, which di&s;clo&s;es the treachery of the The|bans, and of Epialtes, the Malian, who had undertaken to lead part of the Per&s;ian army through a pa&s;s among the mountains of Oeta. This information throws the council into a great tumult, which is pacified by Leonidas, who &s;ends Alpheus to ob&s;erve the motions of the&s;e Per&s;ians, and Dieneces with a party of Lacedaemonians to &s;upport the Phocians, with whom the defence of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the hills had been intru&s;ted. In the mean time Agis &s;ends the bodies of Teribazus and Ariana to the camp of Xerxes.</P>

Arge&s;tes him&s;elf is deputed, who, after revealing his amba&s;&s;y to Leonidas in &s;ecret, is by him led before the whole army, and there receives his an&s;wer. In the mean time Alpheus returns and declares, that the enemies were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the pa&s;&s;ages in the hills, and were ha&s;tening to Thermopylae, upon which Leonidas offers to &s;end away all the army except his three hundred Spartans; but Diomedon, Demo|philus, Dithyrambus, and Megi&s;tias refu&s;e to depart: he then di&s;|mi&s;&s;es Arge&s;tes, informs the Grecians of his de&s;ign to attack the Per&s;ian camp in the night, and making all the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions retires to his pavilion.</P>

<P>Leonidas ri&s;ing about three hours before midnight relates to an a&s;&s;embly of the leaders a dream, which is interpreted by Megi&s;tias; he then arms him&s;elf, and marches in proce&s;&s;ion with his whole troop to an altar newly rais'd on a neighbouring meadow, and there offers a &s;acrifice to the Mu&s;es: he invokes the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e Godde&s;&s;es, he animates his companions, and then placing him&s;elf at their head leads them again&s;t the enemy in the dead of the night.</P>

The Bar|barians are &s;laughter'd in great multitudes, and their camp is &s;et on fire.
