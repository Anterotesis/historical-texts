<HEAD>MARCELLA; A TRAGEDY, OF THREE ACTS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="preface">
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Tragedy may perhaps attract the notice of the curious reader, more by a literary anecdote relating to its &s;ubject, than by any intrin&s;ic merit as a dramatic compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The &s;tory was recommended to <HI>YOUNG</HI> by the Author of Clari&s;&s;a.&mdash;The poet adopted it, and wrote a &s;ingle act; but this &s;hared the fate of his other unfini&s;hed ma|nu&s;cripts, and, according to the direction of his will, was committed to the flames.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars, with a conci&s;e &s;ketch of the &s;tory as related by <HI>RICHARDSON,</HI> were communicated to Mr. <HI>THORNTON</HI> by the poet's very liberal and amiable Son, the neighbour and the much-e&s;teemed relation of my dear departed friend, who wi&s;hed me to build a tragedy upon this foundation.</P>
<P>Some particular circum&s;tances prevented me at that time from executing the de&s;ire of a per&s;on, who, from the integrity of his judgment, and the uncommon warmth
<PB N="4" REF="5">
of his friend&s;hip, had an undi&s;puted title to influence my &s;tudies.&mdash;Other works had engaged me, and this drama|tic &s;tory lay for &s;ome years neglected: but in looking over the letters of my &s;till-valued, though lo&s;t corre&s;pondent, it &s;truck me with new force. As the di&s;tre&s;s, with which it abounds, is of a private nature, it appeared to me &s;in|gularly calculated for my purpo&s;e of forming a drama for a dome&s;tic theatre. I have therefore, with &s;ome con|&s;iderable alterations in the principal incident, rai&s;ed from it a tragedy of three acts; with what &s;ucce&s;s, it is now the privilege of my readers to pronounce.</P>
<P>I will not attempt to influence their deci&s;ion by any arguments in its behalf; but let me be allowed to clo&s;e this &s;hort preface with a little poetical acknowledgment to the two literary illu&s;trious friends, who fir&s;t marked the &s;tory for the tragic Mu&s;e, and from whom it has ac|cidentally de&s;cended to me.</P>

<L>Poor Fanny will blu&s;h, and as often turn pale.</L>
<L>In his ab&s;ence &s;till more and more pen&s;ive &s;he grows,</L>

<HEAD>LORD RUSSEL; A TRAGEDY, OF THREE ACTS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="preface">
<PB REF="163">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE endeavoured to delineate, in the following Drama, an exact portrait of the noble Per&s;onage, who&s;e name it bears; as I believe, that a more enga|ging model of public and private virtue can hardly be &s;elected from the annals of any nation: although the ex|treme mildne&s;s of his temper, the &s;implicity of his man|ners, and, above all, his unaffected piety, are &s;uch qua|lities, as are very rarely admitted in the formation of a Tragic Hero.</P>
<P>To render my performance intere&s;ting to my country, I have adhered as clo&s;ely to our hi&s;tory, as the nature of dramatic compo&s;ition allowed me to do; and in points where I have varied from hi&s;torical truth, &s;uch varia|tions are, I tru&s;t, &s;upported by dramatic probability.</P>
<P>In the &s;pirited and judicious introduction to the lately-publi&s;hed letters of Lady Ru&s;&s;el, the te&s;timony of different Hi&s;torians in collected concerning the &s;enti|ments of Charles the Second and his brother, on the impending fate of Lord Ru&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="164">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the Duke of Monmouth's Journal, it is &s;aid, that the King told him, he inclined to have &s;aved the Lord Ru&s;&s;el, but was forced to con&s;ent to his death, otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t have broke with his bro|ther the Duke of York."</Q><BIBL>&mdash;Kennet.</BIBL></P>
<P>The &s;entence ju&s;t quoted, is, I hope, a &s;ufficient foun|dation for the conduct which I have a&s;&s;igned to Charles; who&s;e character indeed was &s;uch, that fiction can hardly impute to him any in&s;tance of irre&s;olution, duplicity, and fal&s;ehood, which the tenor of his life will not bring within the limits of theatrical credibility.</P>
<P>The candid reader will readily allow the liberty I have taken, in laying the &s;cene in the Tower, after Ru&s;&s;el's condemnation; as it affords many advantages to the conduct of the play.</P>
<P>In compliance with that re&s;pect, which dramatic authors have lately paid to the Clerical character, I have not introduced either Tillot&s;on or Burnet among the per&s;ons of the drama, though the latter was &s;o con|&s;tant an attendant on the captivity of my Hero; an omi&s;&s;ion which I have in &s;ome degree &s;upplied, by the introduction of Mr. Spencer; a character drawn from the printed trial of Lord Ru&s;&s;el, where the name of that gentleman appears in the li&s;t of tho&s;e,
<PB N="165" REF="165">
who gave an honourable evidence in behalf of the noble pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>I have many obligations to the journal written by Burnet, at the reque&s;t of Lady Ru&s;&s;el, which contains all the minute circum&s;tances that occurred, during the impri&s;onment, and at the execution of her Lord. This very intere&s;ting and pathetic narrative is printed in the General Dictionary, under the article Ru&s;&s;el. I have not only taken from it many of the &s;entiments, which I have a&s;&s;igned to him in this Tragedy, but I have &s;ome|times adopted the very words, that were really uttered by Lord Ru&s;&s;el; and this I have done, not only from an affectionate admiration of his character, but from a de&s;pair of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the elegant &s;implicity, and the force of his expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The offer relating to his e&s;cape, &s;o generou&s;ly made, and &s;o nobly refu&s;ed, is a fact univer&s;ally known, and mu&s;t render the names of Cavendi&s;h and Ru&s;&s;el an honour to our country, as long as magnanimity and friend&s;hip retain their ju&s;t value in the e&s;timation of mankind.</P>
