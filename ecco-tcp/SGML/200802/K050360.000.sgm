<PB N="7" REF="8">
Commerce in <HI>Sevil,</HI> made earne&s;t Applica|tion to King <HI>Philip</HI> to put a Stop to it.

<P>But &s;ucceeding Events prevented the further Importunities of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on that Head; and rather favour'd the De&s;igns of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> who made a very politick U&s;e of King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Misfortunes. For the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army

being routed at <HI>Almenara,</HI> and, &s;oon af|ter, totally defeated near <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> up|on the Application the Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> made to the <HI>French</HI> King for im|mediate A&s;&s;i&s;tance, it was required from them, That they &s;hould give their &s;olemn Con&s;ent to the new Treaty of Alliance, then agitating between the Two Crowns, whereby very advantage|ous Conce&s;&s;ions were made to the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI> Which, through the de&s;perate Condition of their Affairs, the Grandees were oblig'd to agree to.

<P>By this Means the <HI>French</HI> have laid a Foundation, not only to keep <HI>Old-Spain</HI> in a perpetual Dependance upon them; by depriving them of that Commerce in which their Riches and Sub&s;i&s;tence mainly con&s;i&s;t; but al&s;o, if not &s;peedily prevented, to &s;upplant all the re&s;t of the World in the Beneficial Trade to <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New-Spain</HI>; and to encrea&s;e the Wealth and Power of <HI>France,</HI> to &s;uch a Degree as (which I hinted before) in

Proce&s;s of Time, to put that ambitious Crown in a Condition to give Laws to <HI>Europe,</HI> and to revive her lately baffled Project of an <HI>Univer&s;al Monarchy.</HI> It is certain, at lea&s;t, that as the Trade to the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI> is the pre&s;ent Support of our Enemies, &s;o, con&s;equent|ly, as long as they pre&s;erve that Trade, there's little Po&s;&s;ibility of bringing this nece&s;&s;ary, but expen&s;ive War, to a &s;afe and honourable Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t be remo|ved from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI></NOTE>We may therefore lay down this Po|litical Axiom, or Maxim, that <HI>The</HI> French <HI>mu&s;t be remov'd from their Settlements in the</HI> Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies, <HI>as the mo&s;t effectual Means, both to procure a la&s;ting Peace, and to &s;ettle the Grand Trade and Wealth of</HI> Europe <HI>on a due Ballance.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This was the main De&s;ign in Eresting the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company.</NOTE>Upon this wi&s;e Con&s;ideration it was, that the Mini&s;try and Parliament thought fit to incorporate the Proprietors of the Army-Debentures, Navy-Bills, Defici|ent-Tallies, and other Publick Debts, to

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir Dudley Digs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'I do profe&s;s, that as my Affection, my Rea&s;on and my Judgment, go &s;trongly with the Scope and Drift of
<PB N="11" REF="12">
this Propo&s;ition; &s;o &s;hall a good Part of my poor Fortune, when it comes to Execution.'</P>
<P>'For to my Under&s;tanding, there was never propounded, in Parliament, a De&s;ign more proper for this Kingdom, nor of more pregnant Advantage to it, whether we con&s;ider the nature of our Scituation, or the Quality of our Ene|my's Forces.'</P>
<P>'As we are an I&s;land, it concerns our very Being to have Store of Ships to defend us, and al&s;o our Well-being by their Trade to enrich us.'</P>
<P>'This A&s;&s;ociation for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> when it &s;hall be regulated and e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Act of Parliament, and thereby &s;e|cured from the Violence and injury of <HI>any intruding hand,</HI> will certainly give many Men Encouragement and Confi|dence, voluntarily to bring in large and liberal Contributions towards &s;o <HI>Noble,</HI> &s;o <HI>Profitable</HI> an <HI>Enterpri&s;e:</HI> So that, in &s;hort time, we &s;hall &s;ee many new Ships built, many brave Men employ'd, and enabled for the Service of their Country. None of this Money &s;hall be carried out of the Kingdom, but laid out for Shipping, which is the Defence of it, and be&s;tow'd upon our own Men, who mu&s;t be fed and maintain'd, tho' they &s;tay at Home. For this
<PB N="12" REF="13">
we &s;hall reap the Fruit of what&s;oever <HI>Benefit, Plantation, Traffick,</HI> or <HI>Purcha&s;e</HI> can procure us, be&s;ides <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Security.</HI>'</P>
<P>'Now, let us a little con&s;ider the Enemy we are to encounter, the King of  <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Whatever was then &s;aid of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> may, in the main, be now appli|ed to the <HI>French</HI> King.</NOTE> <HI>Spain.</HI> They are not his great Territories which make him &s;o power|ful, and &s;o trouble&s;ome to all Chri|&s;tendom. For it is very well known, that <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf is but weak in Men, and barren of natural Commodities. As for his other Territories, they lye divided and a&s;under which is a weak|ne&s;s in it &s;elf. Be&s;ides, they are held by Force, and maintain'd at an extraor|dinary Charge. In&s;omuch, as altho' he be a great King, yet he is like that Gyant, who was &s;aid to have a Hundred Hands, but he had 50 Bellies to feed, &s;o that ratably, he had no more Hands than another Man.'</P>
<P>'No, Sir, they are his MINES in the WEST-INDIES, which Mini&s;ter Fuell to feed his va&s;t <HI>ambitious De&s;ire</HI> of UNIVERSAL MONARCHY: It is the Money he hath from thence, which makes him able to levy, and pay Soldiers in all Places; and to keep an Army continually on foot, ready to in|vade and indanger his Neighbours.'</P>
<P>'So that we have no other way, but
<PB N="13" REF="14">
to endeavour to cut him off at Root, and &s;eek to impeach, or to <HI>Supplant</HI> him in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> By part of which Cour&s;e that Famous Queen, of mo&s;t Glorious Memory, had heretofore almo&s;t brought him on his Knees. And this our Undertaking (if it plea&s;e God to ble&s;s it) mu&s;t needs effect it &s;ooner, and quicker; the whole Body of the Kingdom being United and concurring in a <HI>perpetual Supply</HI> to this Action; &s;o that he will have no free Time given him to re&s;t.'</P>
<P>'Moreover, this will be a Means not only to &s;ave, but to fill his Ma|je&s;ty's Coffers, enabling the People to give him liberally, and often; the King's Ships will have little to do but to guard the Coa&s;ts, for the Sea-War will chiefly be made at the Charge of the Subject. Thus (Sir <HI>Dudley Digs</HI>) I doubt not but that, in a &s;hort Time, both King and People &s;hall be &s;afe at Home, and fear'd Abroad. To con|clude, I &s;hall be very glad to hear any Man make <HI>Objections</HI> again&s;t this <HI>De|&s;ign,</HI> &s;o that he do it with an Intention to retine and perfect the Work; but if any &s;hall &s;peak again&s;t it, with a Mind to hinder and de&s;troy it, I mu&s;t entreat him to pardon me, if I do &s;carce think him to be a GOOD ENGLISH-MAN.'</P>

Tho' the Undertaking be Noble, Great, and Advantageous, yet &s;uch is the Perver&s;ne&s;s of Humane Nature; &s;o prone are the Generality of Men to Cen&s;ure, and find Fault, that 'tis no Wonder this Publick-Spirited De&s;ign has met with Contradiction and Oppo&s;ition; either from a Jealou&s;ie and Unea&s;ine&s;s of Tem|per, almo&s;t in&s;eparable from Money'd-Men, or from the Particular Di&s;gu&s;ts of &s;ome Per&s;ons, who, like Wa&s;pi&s;h and Sullen Patients, reject the mo&s;t Whole|&s;ome Phy&s;ick, becau&s;e they are not pleas'd with the Hand that admini&s;ters it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t Objecti|on.</NOTE>In the fir&s;t Place, it is objected, That, con&s;idering what &s;trong Footing the <HI>French</HI> have got in the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the Attempt to remove them from thence is like to be attended with in&s;u|parable Difficulties; the rather, becau&s;e they are in Conjunction with the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> both at Land and Sea: And &s;up|po&s;ing we could get &s;ome Settlement in the Continent of <HI>South-America,</HI> yet while the War la&s;ts, we could Trade with no more of the Country than we po&s;&s;e&s;s, unle&s;s it be clande&s;tinely; and after the Peace we mu&s;t expect to have le&s;s Trade; whereas the <HI>French</HI> have an open unin|terrupted Commerce with the whole Country.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"><NOTE PLACE="marg">An&s;wer to the Fir&s;t Branch of it.</NOTE>As to the fir&s;t Branch of this Objecti|on, I an&s;wer, That the Nece&s;&s;ity of dri|ving the <HI>French</HI> out of the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies</HI> being once laid down as a Funda|mental Maxim, no Difficulties what&s;o|over ought to deterr us from the Under|taking; whereas, on the contrary, the infinite Advantage and Benefit that will attend the Succe&s;s of the Attempt, ought to be a powerful Incentive to it. We have, in the Cour&s;e of this War, with our Shipping, and a Handful of Land-Men, compa&s;s'd Things of far greater Difficulty; &s;uch as the Taking of <HI>Barce|lona, Gibraltar,</HI> and <HI>Port-Mahon:</HI> And to bring in a fre&s;her In&s;tance, did not Colonel <HI>Nichol&s;on,</HI> with incon&s;iderable Forces, make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Nova Scotia</HI>; which, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, was in a better Po&s;ture of Defence than &s;everal Places in <HI>South-America,</HI> in which the <HI>French</HI> are but newly &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, can any Man of common Sen&s;e entertain &s;o mean an Opinion of tho&s;e who made this Project, and have thereby ju&s;tly merited publick Acknow|ledgments and Rewards, as to think that they did not fore&s;ee, and provide again&s;t all Difficulties that might attend it?

<PB N="28" REF="29">
Informations nece&s;&s;ary to carry on &s;o great an Undertaking with Probability of Succe&s;s: But the <HI>Scheme</HI> they have framed, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal Per&s;ons, who are perfectly well acquain|ted with tho&s;e Countries, is, and ought to remain an ab&s;olute Secret, till all Things be ready for Execution; other|wi&s;e the Enemy might take &s;uch Mea|&s;ures and Precautions as might render the De&s;ign abortive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An&s;wer to the &s;econd Branch of the Fir&s;t Objection.</NOTE>To the Second Part of the Fir&s;t Ob|jection I an&s;wer, That by a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> it is not to be under&s;tood, that we &s;hall take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Ports or Places on the We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>South-America,</HI> which being to be al|low'd as our Acqui&s;itions, pur&s;uant to the Treaty of the Grand-Alliance be|fore-mention'd, We &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame after the Peace is made; and that, from the&s;e Places, we &s;hall carry on a Free Trade with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and Natives of <HI>America,</HI> throughout the re&s;t of their Plantations, as the <HI>French</HI> do now. To be &s;ure, to expect &s;uch a <HI>Free Trade</HI> would be a fond Conceit: For, as du|ring the War, the <HI>French,</HI> in Conjun|ction with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> will certainly endeavour to prevent it; &s;o, after the Peace, <HI>Old-Spain</HI> will not ea&s;ily con&s;ent to it. The &s;ame Rea&s;ons that induc'd
<PB N="29" REF="30">
them, notwith&s;tanding their inbred An|tipathy to the <HI>French,</HI> rather to call the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> to the Throne, than to &s;uffer a Partition of their Monarchy, will, undoubtedly, incline them not to acquie&s;ce in a <HI>Partition of their Direct American</HI> Trade, which, as was hinted before, is the main &s;pring of their Riches, and would, in Effect, be the &s;ame with a <HI>Partition of their Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>But the Trade intended to be carried on by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Corporation to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> will be &s;o far from being Prejudicial to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that as we may, with God's Ble&s;&s;ing, during the War, deliver them from the intruding <HI>French,</HI> of whom (as I hinted before) they wi&s;h them&s;elves to be rid: So, in Time of Peace, our Settlements in the <HI>South-Seas</HI> will rather be an Advantage than a Detriment to <HI>Old-Spain.</HI> This Po&s;ition may, at fir&s;t Blu&s;h, look like a Paradox: But as 'tis mo&s;t certain, That there's room enough on the We&s;tern-Coa&s;t of <HI>South-America</HI> for us to plant and e&s;tabli&s;h a flouri&s;hing Trade in, without invading the Property, or inju|ring the Original Commerce of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>; &s;o, on the other Hand, we may a&s;&s;i&s;t them in carrying on the &s;aid Trade, by &s;upplying them with what they &s;tand mo&s;t in need of, for that Purpo&s;e,
<PB N="30" REF="31">
<HI>viz. Negroes</HI>; which we may ea&s;ily do, with no finall Advantage to our &s;elves; as was before mentioned. By this it appears, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no Rea&s;on to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">'d, but rather to re|joyce at, and favour our Undertaking: Since the Old Treaty of Commerce be|tween <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> of which the exclu&s;ive Article was with Re&s;pect to <HI>New-Spain,</HI> may yet, with Exception only to &s;uch Places as we may po&s;&s;e&s;s our &s;elves of, during the War, remain entire, after the Peace, notwith&s;tanding our <HI>South Sea</HI>-Trade.</P>
<P>And here we may cur&s;orily take No|tice, That be&s;ides the Conce&s;&s;ions made to us by the Treaty of the Grand Al|liance, of &s;uch Places as we &s;hall po&s;|&s;e&s;s in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Title to <HI>California.</HI></NOTE>we have al&s;o a Right to the great I&s;land of <HI>California,</HI> as having been fir&s;t Di&s;cover'd by our Country-Man Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>: A Title of equal Va|lidity with any Preten&s;ions of other <HI>European</HI> Princes, or States, to any Part of the <HI>We&s;t</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> And that I&s;land lying to the North-We&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> may be of great Advantage to us, towards the carrying on, and im|provement of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t Part of it an&s;wer'd.</NOTE>As to the Fir&s;t Part of this Objection, I an&s;wer, That, between Man and Man, to force a free Debtor to take an Intere&s;t for his Debt, and not receive the Princi|pal according to Contract, is certainly ve|ry hard and unju&s;t: But the Ca&s;e is va&s;t|ly different between a Private Man and a Nation; for the fir&s;t may fail, and prove in&s;olvent; the latter never can. It is too vi&s;ible that the Publick Debts, were too Great to be paid off in any Number of Years, while the Burden of an expen&s;ive War lies heavy upon the Nation; and therefore, all that an <HI>Ho|ne&s;t Parliament</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;e Mini&s;try</HI> could do, was to &s;ecure tho&s;e Debts, by a&s;cer|taining them, and putting them into one <HI>Lump,</HI> and by allowing an Intere&s;t of Six <HI>per Cent</HI>; that is, as large an Intere&s;t as was ever allow'd by Parliament, (except upon extraordinary Emergencies) and

One <HI>per Cent.</HI> more than &s;ome of tho&s;e Debts, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Army and Tran&s;port-De|bentures,</HI> had before. So far the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> of the Nation are clear and unblemi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Parliament and Mini&s;try, upon a Contemplation of the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of Removing the <HI>French</HI> out of <HI>South-America,</HI> in Order to attain a Safe, Honourable, and La&s;ting Peace; and of the other great Advan|tages (before-mention'd) that will re&s;ult from a <HI>South-Sea Trade,</HI> re&s;olv'd to erect a Company for that Purpo&s;e; and thereupon <HI>incorporated</HI> the Proprietors of the Publick Debts, who, by rea&s;on of their large Stock, are, certainly, the mo&s;t able to carry on this Undertaking with Probability of Succe&s;s. Now, if ever <HI>Compul&s;ion</HI> can be ju&s;tify'd, (and no Government can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it) it is certainly in a Ca&s;e not only of Nece&s;&s;ity, but Vi&s;ible Benefit.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. Branch of the Fourth Objection an|&s;wer'd.</NOTE>The Second Branch of the Fourth Objection is grounded either upon a Mi&s;take, or a fal&s;e Sugge&s;tion: For the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company is not to make War, and endeavour to di&s;lodge the <HI>French</HI> out of the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> at their own Sole Co&s;t and Expence; but only with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the National-Navy, and Land-Forces, as will be Specified in their Charter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5th Objection.</NOTE>From the Fourth there ari&s;es a Fifth Objection, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Call for the Fi&s;hery being limited to Twenty Shil|lings upon every Hundred Pound, and the Calls for the <HI>South-Sea Trade</HI> left Un|&s;tinted and Di&s;cretionary, the Proprietors of the Publick Debts are ju&s;tly appre|hen&s;ive, that great Sums of Money will be call'd in, for carrying on the &s;aid Undertaking, which has hitherto kept many of the &s;aid Proprietors from Sub&s;cribing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An&s;wer'd.</NOTE>To this I an&s;wer, Fir&s;t, That the Company &s;hall be at no further Charge, than &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary for their own Benefit and Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">Secondly, That their Capital-Stock be|ing near Ten Millions Sterling, a Call of Five Pound upon very Hundred Pound will rai&s;e near 500000<HI>l.</HI> a Sum much greater than the Capital Joint-Stock with which the <HI>French</HI> King, his Grand-Son, and the Subjects of the Two re&s;pective Crowns, undertook and have Settled the Trade to the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and which was only of Six Millions of <HI>French</HI> Livers, that is about 400000<HI>l.</HI> Sterling.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That, according to Her Ma|je&s;ty's Charter, all the &s;everal Calls towards the <HI>South-Sea Trade</HI> are not to exceed Ten Pound upon every Hundred Pound.</P>
<P>Fourthly, And in the la&s;t Place, That the Company being under the Conduct and Management of a Governor and Di|rectors, who &s;hall have the large&s;t Share in the Adventure, and con&s;equently be mo&s;t concern'd in the Pro&s;perity of the Whole; there's no Doubt to be made that, if after &s;uch Tryals as are Nece&s;|&s;ary to be made in all great and difficult Undertakings, they find that the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade will turn to no Account, they will fairly throw it up; and &s;it down contented with an Intere&s;t of Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> for their Capital-Stock, till

the Parliament is in a Condition, and thinks fit to redeem it: For the Compa|ny is only <HI>empower'd,</HI> and <HI>not compell'd</HI> to trade, exclu&s;ive of all others, to the South-Seas; which is &s;o far from being a Hard&s;hip, that it really is, as it was meant, a di&s;tingui&s;hing Favour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fal&s;e Report about the Sub&s;cription.</NOTE>And here we may take Notice of a fal&s;e Report, broach'd either through Mi&s;take, or a Sini&s;ter De&s;ign, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Fourth Part of the Sub&s;cription into this Company was to be made in ready Money; which, being in&s;erted in one of the Publick Foreign Prints of the be&s;t Credit, has undoubtedly hindred ma|ny Foreigners, who are Proprietors of Army-Debentures, or other Publick Debts, from Sub&s;cribing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Notwith&s;tan|ding all Dif|ficulties Four Millions were &s;ub&s;crib'd in Three Weeks</NOTE>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e fal&s;e Re|ports, and Surmizes; notwith&s;tanding the malicious Endeavours, and di&s;cou|raging Sugge&s;tions of &s;ome <HI>di&s;gu&s;ted,</HI> on <HI>ill-de&s;igning Per&s;ons</HI>; notwith&s;tanding all the great Trouble that has, unavoi|dably, attended the Sub&s;cription; &s;uch as the Examining the Title, and ca&s;ting up the broken Sums of every particular Bill, and Debenture, and other Diffi|culties, yet 'tis very remarkable, That in the few Days the Books were open, which did not exceed Three Weeks, near Four Millions were Sub&s;crib'd.
<PB N="37" REF="38">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Millions more ready to be &s;ub&s;crib'd.</NOTE>To this if we add above Two Milli|ons, that are to be Sub&s;crib'd for the U&s;e of the Publick; but which can|not be done till the Accounts of the &s;everal Offices are made up, it may be computed, that above Six Millions are as good as Sub&s;crib'd; and the greate&s;t Part of the Three Millions and a Half remaining would have al&s;o come in, had it not been for the Uncertainty of the Time, when the <HI>Transferr-Books</HI> will be open'd, which cannot be before the <HI>CHARTER</HI> of this Corporation has pa&s;s'd the <HI>Seals</HI>; and the Remote|ne&s;s from <HI>Great Britain</HI> of &s;everal Pro|prietors of the <HI>Publick Debts,</HI> who could not have Time to &s;end Orders to their Corre&s;pondents, while the Sub&s;cription-Books were open'd: <NOTE PLACE="marg">This great Undertaking brought &s;o near Perfecti|on, one of the Wonders of this glorious Reign.</NOTE>So that, the Bringing &s;o great an Un|dertaking &s;o near Perfection, in &s;o &s;hort a Time, may well be reckon'd among the Wonders of Her Maje&s;ty's glorious Reign.</P>
<P>To conclude, Some Doubts that have ari&s;en, about &s;ome Clau&s;es in the Act of Parliament, for the erecting the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Corporation, have fill'd the Minds of &s;ome of the Proprietors of the Publick Debts with ill-grounded jealou&s;ies; which may al&s;o have put &s;ome &s;top to the <HI>Sub&s;cription.</HI> But, as
