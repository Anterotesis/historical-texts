<L>AGAIN that funeral knell?&mdash;'tis Death's deep toll,</L>
<L>And Rutland is no more!&mdash;the general groan,</L>
<L>The gu&s;h of grief from &s;orrow's inmo&s;t &s;oul,</L>
<L>Sound the la&s;t &s;ummons&mdash;He's for ever gone!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="4">
<L>Nor youth, nor titles ranged in proud array,</L>
<L>Nor loftie&s;t lineage, high as kings may go;</L>
<L>Nor a whole people's prayer, have power to &s;tay</L>
<L>The mortal malady's malignant blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such, in this pilgrimage of earthly cares,</L>
<L>For many a &s;hort &s;ojourner the &s;ad &s;igh.</L>
<L>Fate's formidable ordinance declares</L>
<L>The be&s;t are born to &s;uffer and to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But while thro' all her &s;ons Hibernia mourns</L>
<L>The &s;tate&s;man dead, the friend, companion lo&s;t,</L>
<L>In Britain, in his native Britain, burns</L>
<L>No generous brea&s;t to hail his honour'd gho&s;t?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<L>For never from its mournful man&s;ion forth,</L>
<L>Went one more honour'd to the realms above;</L>
<L>And yet not nobler in exalted worth,</L>
<L>Than gracious gifts of courte&s;y and love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah, melancholy thought!&mdash;the general groan</L>
<L>Of heart-felt horror thro' a people &s;pread,</L>
<L>In one &s;ad mourner center'd, all in one,</L>
<L>Soon &s;hall bur&s;t over a lov'd hu&s;band dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dead, ere his hour, by too &s;evere a fate,</L>
<L>In the full prime of life's meridian bloom;</L>
<L>His ardent &s;pirits high with hope elate</L>
<L>Of many a joy, in many a year to come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="6">
<L>Ill-de&s;tin'd youth! nor year, alas, ha&s;t thou,</L>
<L>Nor joy to come, from this devoted day.</L>
<L>Tran&s;ient thy morn of glory, as the bow</L>
<L>That blazons heav'n's blue arch, and fades away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not &s;o the &s;orrows a fond con&s;ort pours!</L>
<L>Sorrows!&mdash;but who may paint what pa&s;&s;eth &s;hew?</L>
<L>With what diviner in&s;piration's powers</L>
<L>An angel's agonies unfold to view?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such, (and the funeral harbinger draws near)</L>
<L>Such, as when fate's irrevocable doom</L>
<L>On her lov'd Lord a&s;&s;ails her fear-full ear,</L>
<L>Pale now and cold in night's eternal gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="7">
<L>What heart, with Shak&s;pear's fire, would firmne&s;s have</L>
<L>To ponder on tho&s;e moments, when De&s;pair</L>
<L>Its gha&s;tly &s;emblance on that face &s;hall grave,</L>
<L>Fairer than Fancy's pencil could make fair?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To hear that voice, that 'witch'd the li&s;t'ning &s;oul</L>
<L>With more than mu&s;ick, all di&s;cordant broke;</L>
<L>In thrilling plaints, di&s;dainful of controll,</L>
<L>Calling on cruel Death, who&s;e ruthle&s;s &s;troke</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Kill'd all her hopes?&mdash;"You &s;unk him to the tomb,</L>
<L>"Remor&s;ele&s;s Death! you &s;ped the dart, (&s;he cries;)</L>
<L>"Ere I to catch the parting breath could come,</L>
<L>"Pre&s;s his pale lips, and clo&s;e his dying eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="8">
<L>"He's gone! the bright &s;tar that illum'd my &s;ky!</L>
<L>"Di&s;colour'd now with dim'd and loath&s;ome light.</L>
<L>"Where e'er I turn, no gleam of comfort nigh;</L>
<L>"'Tis &s;ilence all, and &s;olitude, and night!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Now never more, the lonely hour to cheer,</L>
<L>"Shall he be &s;een; to read the wi&s;tful eye;</L>
<L>"Hear inward angui&s;h &s;igh'd to Pa&s;&s;ion's ear,</L>
<L>"Sooth'd only by re-murm'ring Pa&s;&s;ion's &s;igh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"No, he's for ever gone! friend, hu&s;band, all,</L>
<L>"For which in this wa&s;te world I long'd to live.</L>
<L>"Vainly to me its vain enchantments call;</L>
<L>"Nought have I now to a&s;k, or that to give;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="9">
<L>"Then let what may take all!"&mdash;Ah, Lady, &s;till,</L>
<L>Something remains, &s;ad Lady; &s;till too dear!</L>
<L>When Pa&s;&s;ion's ruffled gale hath blown its fill,</L>
<L>Oh, there's a tender call &s;till claims thy care!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A hu&s;band's la&s;t fond pledges of his love;</L>
<L>His and your love, for ever left behind.</L>
<L>And &s;hall &s;uch pledges ineffectual prove?</L>
<L>Such melting motives on a mother's mind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too haple&s;s Lady! no.&mdash;Each lenient art</L>
<L>To lighten their di&s;tre&s;s, that love will try;</L>
<L>Silence the throbbings of a bleeding heart,</L>
<L>And be to them their parent in the &s;ky.</L>

<L>So, like &s;ome flower, (if with prophetic view</L>
<L>The poet's eye may glance on days to come)</L>
<L>Like &s;ome &s;pring-flower, reviv'd from noxious dew,</L>
<L>Shall that bright form, emerging from the gloom</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of blank Misfortune's frown, with vivid glow</L>
<L>Again bloom forth; with ro&s;eat &s;miles again</L>
<L>Feel Health's gay &s;pirits animated flow,</L>
<L>And once more lead the loves' and graces' train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such the warm hope of all, who&s;e &s;ouls e'er dwelt</L>
<L>On the fair wonder of that heav'nly face;</L>
<L>Felt for &s;uch grief as only can be felt,</L>
<L>Which ev'n the mu&s;e her&s;elf wants pow'r to trace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="11">
<L>Oh, then forgive the meane&s;t of her train;</L>
<L>To Rutland or to Fame how lightly known;</L>
<L>Who touch'd by &s;ympathy, in artle&s;s &s;train,</L>
<L>Pre&s;umes with her laments to mix his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But born alike into a world of woe,</L>
<L>In&s;en&s;ibly we form the feeling brea&s;t;</L>
<L>Humanity heav'n &s;ends to high and low,</L>
<L>The beggar and the king, a common gue&s;t.</L>
