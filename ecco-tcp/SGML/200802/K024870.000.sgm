<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ENGAGED to you by every &s;enti|ment of affection and e&s;teem; united with you in the &s;ame political principles and ideas of the con&s;titution; I need not pro&s;e&s;s my zeal for your inter|e&s;ts and honour. I have always acted with you, and can now look back with plea&s;ure on our pa&s;t conduct. I find it &s;teady and uniform, except in one in|&s;tance, when we were fir&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly en|gaged, and afterwards as in&s;en&s;ibly car|ried too far in &s;upport of the War in Germany. I make this acknowledg|ment, without apprehen&s;ion of offen|ding, as I know your opinions upon that &s;ubject. But a new and extraordinary cri&s;is of affairs is coming forward, which will call upon us to maintain the integ|rity of our political principles and cha|racter.
<PB N="4" REF="3">
I am therefore de&s;irous to lay before you &s;uch Rea&s;ons, as, in my o|pinion, ought to influence our future conduct and engagements, with regard to the &s;trange things that are pa&s;&s;ing here.</P>
<P>An oppo&s;ition is forming again&s;t the mea&s;ures of government. Such is the language of &s;ome people to expre&s;s a per&s;onal di&s;like to mini&s;ters, or a conte&s;t for power, for places and employments. Could I think it perfectly decent, I would rather call the pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition a for|med de&s;ign again&s;t his MAJESTY'S inde|pendance, and liberty in exerci&s;ing the mo&s;t con&s;titutional prerogatives of his crown. The declared and avowed in|tention of the great per&s;ons engaged in it, is to command the pre&s;ent reign, and dictate to their Sovereign; <HI>humbly</HI> to inform him, to whom he &s;hall give, not only the direction of the public affairs, but even his private affection and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Two noble per&s;ons, and a third, &s;till more noble, have declared them&s;elves the patrons and leaders of this oppo&s;iti|on. The two fir&s;t appear in &s;upport of the whig intere&s;t, and the old Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="5" REF="4">
families, formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed by that denomination. They complain, that the tories, by which title they mean to di&s;tingui&s;h the country-gentlemen, to whom I am writing, are received by the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration into offices of tru&s;t and confidence; or what, perhaps, in &s;pight of the &s;pirit of re&s;igning, they more re&s;ent, into places of profit in the &s;tate. Thus have they revived tho&s;e unhappy di&s;tinctions, under which our fathers were enli&s;ted, and engaged in almo&s;t civil war. The noble per&s;ons would renew this war, and, in contra|diction to all con&s;titutional principles, would narrow the bounds of maje&s;ty, and confine its cares, its attention, and its bounty, to a part, which ought to be diffu&s;ed through the whole, of the nation. Thus would they make their &s;ov|ereign, in Hamlet's language, a king of &s;hreds and patches, in&s;tead of the com|mon father and monarch of his people.</P>
<P>Another of their complaints is truly mo&s;t unaccountable, that his MAJESTY, in proof of his fir&s;t declaration to his parliament, is indeed a Briton; true to the intere&s;ts of his native country, and
<PB N="6" REF="5">
uninfluenced by any predilection for Hanover. An attachment to German mea&s;ures was the deepe&s;t &s;tain of the two late reigns. When his pre&s;ent MA|JESTY came to the Throne, he found us involved in a continental war, to which the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of this nation had been &s;acrificed. The dignity and honour of the kingdom were ignominiou&s;ly a|bandoned, by treaty, to the in&s;olence and arrogance of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. May no &s;uch treaty ever appear again, to &s;tain and darken the glory of the Briti&s;h annals! in this &s;ituation, our &s;overeign, gracious and good, would have given up Hanover to the welfare of his native country. He would have put an end to the German war. Impo&s;&s;ible. He would have recalled his Briti&s;h troops. Impracticable. This continental mi&s;|chief hung, like a dead weight, im|moveable, upon all other operations of the war. It lay equally heavy upon the negotiations of peace, and emboldened our enemies to refu&s;e us tho&s;e terms, which we had a right from our &s;ucce&s;&s;es in every part of the world, to demand. But, if the noble per&s;ons have founded
<PB N="7" REF="6">
their oppo&s;ition upon the&s;e complaints again&s;t their &s;overeign, what wonders of political architecture may we not ex|pect, when they rai&s;e the &s;uper&s;tructure of &s;action upon &s;uch a foundation?</P>
<P>But, in truth, what do they propo&s;e? That one of them &s;hould indulge his natural di&s;po&s;ition, and plea&s;e him&s;elf with the hopes of finding his account in tumults and confu&s;ion; in parliamenta|ry di&s;putes, and the riots of elections, is nothing wonderful. They may recall a momentary youth, and bring back to his imagination tho&s;e illu&s;trious &s;cenes, in which he fir&s;t di&s;played his political abilities. Experience then taught him the value of the&s;e active virtues, and habit|ude has confirmed him in his good opi|nion of their merit. Even age, and its unavoidable infirmities, have not convinced him of the breach of cha|racter, in engaging again in the conte&s;ts of ambition with people, who are only entering on this bu&s;y tumultuous &s;cene. I do not mean to blame, and I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to pity him.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>Whoever has not in him&s;elf, and his own under&s;tanding, the re&s;ources of re|tirement and &s;elf-enjoyment, is allowed to go abroad at whatever indecent hour, for amu&s;ement and di&s;&s;ipation. His age, however, might ju&s;tly &s;tartle the mo&s;t &s;anguine &s;pirits, that found their future hopes of ambition upon a life of more than three&s;core and ten. But &s;ome gentlemen, furely influenced, rather by a principle of gratitude, than any rea&s;onable appear|ance of his &s;ucce&s;s in this de&s;perate pro|ject, have re&s;igned their employments, u&s;eful at lea&s;t, if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their oeconomy. What have they to expect from a life of &s;eventy years, ani|mated by the &s;hort and wa&s;ting vigour of the rage of faction, and an unnatural ambition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>The &s;econd noble Per&s;on is of &s;o differ|ent a character, &s;o naturally an enemy to violent and precipitate councils, that it is amazing, by what influences he could be wrought to engage in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of oppo&s;ition. He certainly does not fore&s;ee the unhappy con&s;equences, into which he will unavoidably, and without a po&s;&s;ibility</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>of retreating, be led by the&s;e engagements. He, who loves his country, and reveres the con&s;titution, is expo&s;ing them both to certain confu&s;ion, and at lea&s;t, probable di&s;tre&s;s. There is another circum&s;tance, with regard to this noble Per&s;on, not a little &s;ingular. With all affliction and reverence for his Maje&s;ty, he is entering into league and amity with a party, who are determined to di&s;tre&s;s his mea&s;ures, and in&s;ult his admini&s;tration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is wholly foreign to the de&s;ign of this letter to enquire into the circum&s;tances, either of his re&s;ignation or Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. I hope, however, he does not think it the right of &s;ubjects, only, to re&s;ent, and that princes are to be in&s;en&s;ible to the neglect of duty, and the indecent behaviour of their &s;ervants. But if the noble Per&s;on founds his oppo&s;ition upon the indignity, whether real or &s;uppo&s;ed, with which he has been treated, where &s;hall we fix our ideas of virtue, particularly that fir&s;t of virtues, the love of our country, when a man &s;hall dare to avow his private re&s;entment, as a ju&s;tifiable rea&s;on for his oppo&s;ing publick mea&s;ures? Upon this plea, the late Lord</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Bolingbroke <HI>has ju&s;tified his entering into the &s;ervice of the Pretender, and his leav|ing it. "But an ancient family is di&s;|honoured by &s;uch an indignity." What right has any man to plead the merit and &s;ervices of his ance&s;tors, who has him&s;elf deviated from that line of conduct, which they thought duty to their &s;overeign?</HI></P>
<P><HI>But, as I conceive, we are deeply in|tere&s;ted in the conduct of this noble per|&s;on, we are therefore authori&s;ed to enquire into the motives of it, and I think we may rely upon the following account. He had early in life conceived &s;ome very ex|alted notions of the rights of whiggi&s;m to direct the admini&s;tration, and to go|vern the &s;overeign. He therefore would no longer hold an employment by which he was bliged to the mortification of &s;eeing the Taries,</HI> &s;ight hateful, fight tormen|ting, <HI>received at court, upon equal terms of grace and favour with other &s;ubjects, in proportion to their per&s;onal merit, their birth and fortune. He was &s;ome|times obliged by his office to introduce them to the royal pre&s;ence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
The third noble per&s;on feels it a mat|ter of his indignation, that his &s;overeign will not again enter into his nonage, and &s;ubmit him&s;elf to a &s;econd pupillage. He would gain by force that power, with which neither the wi&s;dom of his royal Father, nor the apprehen&s;ions of the people, would intru&s;t him in the year 1751. But of what injuries does he complain? He has been treated, du|ring the pre&s;ent reign, and more e&s;pe|cially during the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration, with every di&s;tinction due to his rank and relation to the crown. Even in the late&s;t in&s;tance, when a plan was formed by the mini&s;try for the reduction of the Havanna, it was immediately &s;ent to him for his approbation. The com|mander in chief was appointed accord|ing to his nomination. Every thing he a&s;ked in order to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition was in&s;tantly complied with. The vigour of the mini&s;try &s;ee|med to &s;econd his demands. Never were any troops better appointed. Upon what pretence of complaint, therefore, can he enter into an unnatural alliance in
<PB N="12" REF="11">
oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;ts of his own Family? What views of future power can tempt him to join with a man, whom he mo&s;t &s;incerely dete&s;ts, to di&s;tre&s;s the Crown, to which he is &s;o nearly related? Is it <HI>Agrippina</HI>'s impotence of ambition, <HI>eo loedi, quia non regnaret?</HI> Does he con&s;ider him&s;elf a prince of the blood, and is this his proper conduct? Does he acknowledge him&s;elf a &s;ubject, and is this his proof of duty to his &s;overeign? But, in truth, he is as much a &s;ubject to the Crown, and, in all human probabi|lity, as far removed from the throne, as any private gentleman in England; Oli|ver Cromwell indeed ro&s;e to the tyranny of his country, as a private gentleman, and Richard the Third as an uncle.</P>
<P>We have often been reproached with our apprehen&s;ions of military power. Whether tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions were in them&s;elves ju&s;t or not, we certainly were ju&s;tified, in being watchful to repel even a po&s;&s;ible danger, &s;o formidable, indeed &s;o fatal, to the liberty of our country. It is wi&s;dom to fore&s;ee &s;uch danger; it is courage to meet it in its approach; it
<PB N="13" REF="12">
is our duty to die or to repel it. But now what will they who u&s;ed to impute our fears to us as crimes; what will they &s;ay now? when the profe&s;&s;ion of the oppo&s;ition is to govern the King ab&s;olutely, when the leader of that op|po&s;ition is a military leader, who has hardly any other ideas of government, than what he learned in the German di&s;cipline, which our &s;oldiers, unu&s;ed to &s;uch &s;everity, &s;uch cruelty, &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt, and &s;o loudly re&s;ented. If this man comes into power by violence, he mu&s;t maintain it by violence. Yet when he places him&s;elf at the head of Faction, every officer, who has a &s;eat in parlia|ment, and joins under &s;uch a leader, in &s;uch a cau&s;e, mu&s;t give us very &s;erious apprehen&s;ions. We cannot look upon &s;uch a member of parliament as a man merely following his own opinion in ci|vil matters: Whenever he &s;ucceeds, he becomes an in&s;trument to oppre&s;s the liberty of a Free People. But when this commander in chief both of the King and army &s;hall pour abroad his &s;pirit upon the &s;oldiery&mdash;the unhappy Ro|man,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
upon whom Sylla either forgot or neglected to &s;mile, was butchered by his guards.</P>
<P>Shall we then unite with him in de|&s;igns of &s;uch dreadful apprehen&s;ions to the very being of the con&s;titution? we have in reproach, been called the dupes of many oppo&s;itions. Adhering to our common principles, we have de&s;pi&s;ed &s;uch reproach. Yet in honour to our under&s;tanding, let us not be the dupes to tho&s;e, who invite us to join in our own de&s;truction, and the de&s;truction of what ever is mo&s;t dear to us. But how does this noble per&s;on propo&s;e to him&s;elf a po&s;&s;ibility of engaging us to &s;upport his oppo&s;ition? by what methods does he propo&s;e to carry this extraordinary project into execution? By methods as extraordinary as the project it&s;elf. A certain Right Honourable Gentleman is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a mighty influence o|ver us, an influence powerful enough to turn us from our intere&s;t, our duty, and even our gratitude.</P>
<P>We have the highe&s;t opinion of the Right Honourable Gentleman's abilities.
<PB N="15" REF="14">
His influence among&s;t us is acknowled|ged. But what arguments can po&s;&s;ibly convince us, that we ought to engage in this mo&s;t unnatural alliance? what eloquence &s;educe us, from our pre&s;ent Honourable &s;ituation? we are here pla|ced between the per&s;on of our &s;overeign, and the dangerous rage of party; bet|ween the prerogatives of his Crown, appointed by the wi&s;dom of the con&s;ti|tution, and the intrigues of precipitate ambition, joined with the arrogance of Family, and led on by a &s;pirit that de|lighteth in blood. If the Prerogatives, granted to the throne by our ance&s;tors, are either oppre&s;&s;ive or dangerous to li|berty, let them be legally taken away. But let it be well con&s;idered before they are given to another part of the con&s;titu|tion, &s;ome of whom have already &s;hewn their inclination to render them&s;elves formidable to the liberty of their country. In proof of his a&s;&s;ertion, three or four families have formed an oppo&s;ition, that dares to threaten and in&s;ult their &s;ove|reign. They have a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
as mo&s;t honourable, the no longer exi&s;ting title of whigs; they have given to us, country gen|tlemen, as mo&s;t ignominious, the no longer ex|i&s;ting name of tories.</P>
<P>I have not mentioned the folly, with regard to our intere&s;t of uniting with the&s;e noble per|&s;ons. I &s;hould think it almo&s;t an indignity to mention the word intere&s;t to gentlemen, who, I am per&s;uaded, will act upon other motives, tho&s;e of principle and honour; of probity and a love for our country. Such have hitherto been the motives of our conduct, and &s;urely nothing can hereafter be given us in exchange for our in|tegrity; no recompence for the violation of that character, which we have always, and, I tru&s;t, we &s;hall always maintain.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Gentlemen, Your mo&s;t obedient Servant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
