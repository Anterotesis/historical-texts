<L>IN cla&s;&s;ic times, as learned authors &s;ay,</L>
<L>When <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> wits produc'd a play,</L>
<L>The herald <HI>Prologue,</HI> 'ere the &s;ports began,</L>
<L>Fairly &s;tept forward, and announc'd the plan:</L>
<L>In few plain words he ran the fable through,</L>
<L>And, without favour, publi&s;h'd all he knew.</L>
<L>An hone&s;t cu&s;tom: for the plan was clear,</L>
<L>The &s;cene was &s;imple, and the Mu&s;e &s;incere;</L>
<L>No tawdry fa&s;hions warp'd the public ta&s;te,</L>
<L>The times were candid, and the &s;tage was cha&s;te.</L>

<L>Can we expect, in the&s;e enlighten'd days,</L>
<L>A courtly age &s;hould hold &s;uch vulgar ways?</L>
<L>Or that a blabbing prologue &s;hould di&s;clo&s;e</L>
<L>Scenes, which no Mu&s;e of fa&s;hion ever &s;hows.</L>
<L>No, Sirs,<HI>&mdash;Sethona is the lady's name&mdash;</HI></L>
<L><HI>She lives at Memphis&mdash;of un&s;ullied fame:</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Tyrant woo'd her&mdash;but &s;he lik'd another,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And once 'twas fear'd her lover was her brother.</HI></L>
<L>As for the re&s;t, a little patience borrow,</L>
<L>The <HI>Chronicle</HI> will tell you all to-morrow.</L>
<L>Authors are now &s;o over mode&s;t grown,</L>
<L>They publi&s;h all men's writings, but their own.</L>
</LG>

<L>But let no living bard conceive offence,</L>
<L>Nor take the general in a partial &s;en&s;e.</L>
<L>Peace to all &s;uch! the lab'ring bee mu&s;t feed</L>
<L>From flow'r to flow'r; perchance from weed to weed;</L>

<L>An ab&s;ent bard, engag'd in di&s;tant war,</L>
<L>This night appears by proxy at your bar:</L>

<L>From &s;ultry Ormus and the realms of day,</L>
<L>His active mind, &s;uperior to its toil,</L>
<L>Struck out the&s;e &s;cenes upon the burning &s;oil.</L>
<L>No cooling grottoes, no umbrageous groves,</L>
<L>To win the Graces, and allure the Loves;</L>
<L>No Heliconian fount wherein to dip,</L>
<L>And &s;lake the burning fever on his lip;</L>
<L>Before him all is de&s;art, wa&s;te, and dry,</L>
<L>Above him flames the tyrant of the &s;ky;</L>
<L>Around his temples gath'ring whirlwinds fight,</L>
<L>And drifts of &s;corching du&s;t involve the light:</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>COLONEL DOW, when he &s;ailed for India, left the following Tragedy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. GARRICK. The event has &s;hewn, that the reputation of an ab&s;ent author could not have been tru&s;ted in &s;afer hands. He &s;pared no expence as a manager, no pains as a man of ta&s;te. The Scenery is &s;trictly characteri&s;tical, and highly picture&s;que. The Dre&s;&s;es are magnificent and expen&s;ive, the Parts ca&s;t with great judgement; and the whole conducted with that regularity and ea&s;e, which can only be attained by a thorough knowledge of the Drama, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Stage. Mrs. BARRY, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every power to touch, to penetrate, to di&s;|&s;olve the heart, exerted them in a degree that a&s;toni&s;hed while it plea&s;ed the audience. Mr. BARRY was judicious, cha&s;te, and pa|thetic in Seraphis. Mr. REDDISH, &s;pirited, and full of fire, in Menes. In their re&s;pec|tive parts, the two AICKINS de&s;erved and received great applau&s;e. Ample ju&s;tice was done by Mr. PACKER, and others, to the re&s;t of the characters. The public, and the author, are indebted to Mr. CUMBERLAND, for an elegant and cla&s;&s;ical Prologue: And to Mr. GARRICK, for one of the be&s;t Epi|logues that ever was pronounced from the &s;tage.</P>
