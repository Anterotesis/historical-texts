<HEAD>AN EPISTLE FROM Mr. <HI>Theophilus Cibber,</HI> Comedian, TO Mr. <HI>Thomas Sheridan,</HI> Tragedian.</HEAD>

<HI>July</HI> 19, 1743.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE><HI>Mr.</HI> SHERIDAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR injudicious Di&s;appointment of the Company la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> who expected to &s;ee you in the Character of CATO, and your indi&s;creet Attempt to di&s;mi&s;s the Audience, having, as you confe&s;s, become a Town-talk, and given Ri&s;e to many idle Fal&s;hoods, meerly
<PB N="4" REF="3">
calculated to injure the Innocent: You mu&s;t ex|cu&s;e me if I relate the Fact, &s;trictly adhering to Truth. There were many Witne&s;&s;es of what I am about to declare; and I know none, except your&s;elf, who&s;e Memory is weak enough to for|get it, or will be hardy enough to deny it</P>
<P>When it drew near the Time proper to begin the Play, Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> and my&s;elf were alarm'd, in the Dre&s;&s;ing-room with a Report, that you declared you would not play, becau&s;e you had not the &s;ame Robe you wore in that Character before; and that you &s;aid, The Audience mu&s;t be di&s;mi&s;s'd. This Rea&s;on for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing an Audience, (propos'd by you who had no Right to di&s;mi&s;s them) appear'd to me &s;o weak, I could not believe it, till you came into the Room, and &s;wore, Unle&s;s you had that Robe, you would not act. This Declaration I looked upon as a ra&s;h Expre&s;&s;ion, the meer Effect of your then ruffled Temper; but could not yet &s;uppo&s;e you would proceed &s;o idly as you did: You were then compleatly dre&s;s'd from Head to Foot (as well as ever the Character was dre&s;s'd in any Theatre in <HI>Ireland</HI> or <HI>England</HI>) all but the Robe.</P>
<P>Upon Enquiry, it appeared, the Robes wore by <HI>Cato, Juba</HI> and <HI>Sempronius,</HI> the fir&s;t Night, were borrowed by <HI>Philips,</HI> of &s;ome Gentle|woman
<PB N="5" REF="4">
in this Town, who bought them in an Auction at <HI>London,</HI> &s;ome Time &s;ince, but were by no Means the Property of the Managers, or any one belonging to the Theatre, nor were to be got that Night: &s;o all the Heroes were e|qually di&s;appointed of tho&s;e Trappings. Your Impatience increa&s;ed, and, tho' another Robe was brought you (the &s;ame Robe that was made new, this Year, for Mr. <HI>Husband,</HI> in the Cha|racter of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>) you per&s;i&s;ted in having the other uncomeatable Robe, or you po&s;itively would undre&s;s, and was determined not to play. To every body's Surprize, you did un|dre&s;s, and, in &s;pight of the mo&s;t friendly Re|mon&s;trances to the contrary, you made a broken kind of Speech to the Audience; with which they were &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied, they could not help &s;hewing it.</P>
<P>Before you went on, I entreated you (on the meer exchange of a Robe) not to do &s;o unpolitic a Thing, I might add, unpolite, as to think of di&s;appointing the Town of their Diver&s;ion: You reply'd, The Vexation had deprived you of your Voice, and rendered you incapable of per|forming: I de&s;ired you ro con&s;ider, the fir&s;t Act was of &s;uch a con&s;iderable Length, you might have Time enough to recover your Temper, and your Voice would probably return with it; or if the Defect la&s;ted, your attempting to per|form
<PB N="6" REF="5">
would appear &s;o obliging, the Audience would readily make any Allowances, when they knew you had been ruffled, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to think of giving them no Play at all, was what I could not but conceive would offend them.</P>
<P>To repeat all was &s;aid to you on this Occa|&s;ion, would add to the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of this Re|cital: But, as near as I can remember, nothing was omitted, in the mo&s;t friendly Manner, to di&s;&s;uade you from your mi&s;taken Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I am informed you &s;tay'd afterwards, ju&s;t long enough to hear the extraordinary indulgent Reception the Audience were plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on my propo&s;ing, with their Leave, to give them the Play, <HI>in the be&s;t Manner we could, &s;ince it was not in our Power to give it them &s;o well as we would.</HI> You then ran ha&s;tily out of the Hou&s;e, and &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age afterwards to the Theatre, That you would not, by any Means, have your Name delivered out for another Play, for you would po&s;itively act no more.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not, Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> have given you or my&s;elf this Trouble, but for the many Re|ports that fly about, of which, 'tis &s;aid, you are the Author: And &s;ince I have advanced &s;o far, I mu&s;t go a little farther, and make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">w hone&s;t <HI>Queries</HI>; then, giving you a little
<PB N="7" REF="6" MS="y">
Advice, &s;hall &s;ubmit to the Determination of the Publick, whether I (as it has been in&s;inua|ted) ever intended you the lea&s;t Prejudice; or, on the contrary, have not always acted towards you with good Manners and good Nature?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then,&mdash;have I not your Letter by me, &s;ent to me when in <HI>England,</HI> wherein you expre&s;s your&s;elf very de&s;irous of my acting in the &s;ame Theatre with you, and are &s;olicitous for my coming over?&mdash;And do you not know, your particular Application &s;ince my Arrival, was one of my &s;tronge&s;t Motives for playing in <HI>Smock-Alley,</HI> where I am likely to have a Law-&s;uit, for my Right, with the Managers, tho' I was offer'd the &s;ame Terms from <HI>Aungier-Street</HI> Play-hou&s;e, where my Agreement would have been &s;ign'd by a Gentleman of Honour, who&s;e Pay is as good as the Bank.</P>
<P>Have I not, on your Return to the Stage this Sea&s;on, in Compliment to you, play'd &s;ome in|ferior Characters, which, 'tis well known I had a long time re&s;ign'd to younger Actors, in <HI>Eng|land?</HI></P>
<P>Did I omit any Care, or grudge any Pains, to keep the Audience in Temper, when your &s;udden Indi&s;po&s;ition prevented your playing, the fir&s;t intended Night of King <HI>Lear</HI>? Or could
<PB N="8" REF="7">
I, for a Brother, have been more Active, to &s;ilence the Reports then made to your Preju|dice? &mdash; <HI>&s;ed Tu Brute</HI>!</P>
<P>Have not I de&s;ir'd you, tho' our remaining Nights of Playing were few, and we had large Sums at Stake, to fix the Plays to your own Mind?</P>
<P>Have not you been paid a large Part of that fre&s;h Agreement you made, but did not com|pleat, while we are unpaid our Agreements, tho', we have, 'tis notorious, often &s;olicited the Managers to relea&s;e us, if they found the emp|tine&s;s of the Town would not an&s;wer their continuing our Performance?&mdash;But we could get neither our Liberty nor our Money.</P>
<P>Have not you often been an Ear-witne&s;s of the&s;e Propo&s;als, and as often declar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d, we be|hav'd with the greate&s;t Lenity, and &s;tricte&s;t Ho|nour?</P>
<P>Did not your &s;udden breaking off from Play|ing leave us in a di&s;plea&s;ing Dilemma? And was it not rea&s;onable for us, to propo&s;e acting &s;uch Pieces, as might excite the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity in the Town, whereby the Managers might be enabled to pay us, and the re&s;t of the Company?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">Did I not decline ('till your po&s;itive Decla|ration, that you would play no more this Sea|&s;on) appearing in any Character you had per|form'd? And did you not xpre&s;s your&s;elf as oblig'd to me, on making you that Compliment, as you were pleas'd to term it?</P>
<P>How comes it then, Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> reported, that Mr. <HI>Giffard,</HI> and my &s;elf, have intended you any injury? Or from whence is it &s;aid, that we (ridiculous! as fal&s;e!) lock'd up your Cloaths, and did all we could to prevent your Playing? This, Sir, has been &s;o frequently a&s;|&s;erted, as a Fact related by you, that you ought as a Friend to Truth, to have fully an&s;wer'd &s;uch mon&s;trous Fal&s;hoods; or, may we not rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, you did &s;pread &s;uch Reports? If you can be the Author of &s;uch naughty Tales, what Language is fit to paint you?</P>
<P>The Letters I read this Day in the <HI>Dublin Journal,</HI> if not <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> yours, are yet &s;o worded, an impartial Reader cannot but &s;ee they were, at lea&s;t, the Work of &s;ome mi&s;ta|ken Friend, who&s;e good Nature you had im|po&s;ed on, by fal&s;e Relations: From whom, but you, could come the <HI>&s;atisfactory Rea&s;ons, (not one of which are mentioned</HI>) for your not performing? Or the poor low Invectives, and mean Inuendoes therein contained?&mdash;Whom
<PB N="10" REF="9">
do you mean, by <HI>De&s;igning Wretches,</HI> and <HI>Theatrical Politicians?</HI> Or what can you in|tend but to in&s;inuate, you have been artfully drove from the Stage, when you know your Ab&s;ence from thence is ab&s;olutely your own Act and Deed?</P>
<P>Fie! fie! &s;tick to Truth, or be a&s;hamed of &s;uch publick Addre&s;&s;es, or to &s;hew your Face after them.</P>
<P>May not one &s;uppo&s;e, Ma&s;ter <HI>Sheridan,</HI> the kind and civil Intention of the&s;e two Letters, is to create a Di&s;turbance in the future Audi|ences?</P>
<P>But let me inform you, when a Rebuff to an Actor appears premeditated and be&s;poke from Prejudice, &s;uch Treatment may put a poor Player out of Humour; but &s;ure, it ought not to put him out of Countenance.</P>
<P>If you withdraw your&s;elf from the Theatre, for a Time, mu&s;t all Diver&s;ion &s;top till your Return? If a Vintner has not <HI>Ortelans,</HI> or any other extraordinary Dainties, in the Larder, will his Gue&s;ts think it impertinent, if they are intreated to take &s;uch homely Entertainment as the Hou&s;e affords?&mdash; And if the Defects of o|thers, &s;erve as a Foil to the Brilliancy of your
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Performance, why &s;hould you be angry, at what, if you'd keep your Temper, might prove &s;o con&s;olable to you?</P>
<P>Dear <HI>Tommy,</HI> don't prove &s;uch a Dog in a Manger; if you don't chu&s;e Oats, why &s;hould you &s;tarve the re&s;t of the Theatrical Cattle? Have more Compa&s;&s;ion on your fellow Crea|tures, or fellow Comedians.</P>
<P>But, Ma&s;ter <HI>Tommy,</HI> may we not &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect, tho' your Performances have been hi|therto mo&s;tly tragical, you have given your Mind a little Bent towards Comedy, and, in tho&s;e Studies, have taken a Hint from <HI>Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Petulant?</HI> who, to keep up an extraordinary Reputation, was notorious, under a Di&s;gui&s;e, for calling for him&s;elf at a Coffee-hou&s;e; where he would &s;ometimes, in a Mask, &s;end in for him&s;elf, wait for him&s;elf, nay, and not finding him&s;elf, would frequently <HI>leave a Letter for him&s;elf:</HI>&mdash;'Faith, you are highly in Luck in improving a Hint, I find.</P>
<P>But let me ask you a home Que&s;tion&mdash; Has not a great deal of that &s;u&s;s of Mind, you have lately &s;hewn, been more owing to your Di&s;ap|pointment, that the Audience would not depart, when you declar'd your high and mighty Di&s;|plea&s;ure, becau&s;e you had not the &s;elf-&s;ame
<PB N="12" REF="11">
gew-gaw, tin&s;el Train, more than from any Fears you had of having di&s;pleas'd them? Or was it nangry, becau&s;e any one was permitted (under great Di&s;advantages) meerly to attempt, what they had never in their Lives a Thought of per|forming? Why this is the pa&s;&s;ionate Extrava|ganza of our Brother PISTOL, who, &s;corning all Contradiction, or Competition, bounces about in his Boots, kicks his Heels with Fury again&s;t the Stage, and &s;well'd with &s;waggering Rage and Non&s;en&s;e cries,
<Q>Shall Dunghill Curs confront with <HI>Helicon,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Shall Pack-Hor&s;es, and hollow pamper'd Jades of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> that can|not travel thirty Miles a day, compare with <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and with <HI>Cannibals,</HI> and with <HI>Trojan Greeks,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>
But, as our Friend con|cludes, <Q REND="inline">"Shall we fall foul for Toys?&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Tho' I don't think there is any thing per&s;o|nally terrible about you, yet I own you a Gen|tleman of great Formidability, who have the Power if you &s;ay true (and you know you have talk'd at that paw-paw Rate) of calling down the Barracks, on any one you conde&s;cend to be di&s;pleas'd with: Pray, do you mean the Stone Buildings? for I can't &s;uppo&s;e you pre&s;ume to have any Command over the Gentlemen there, as I never heard of any Commi&s;&s;ion the King had yet honour'd you with; and I believe there is hardly any there will think it worth their
<PB N="13" REF="12">
while, to attend the Call of your Whi&s;tle, to a &s;illy Riot: I am rather inclinable to think, the worthy Spirits, there, are more impatient to at|tend the Call of a Trumpet, at this glorious Juncture, and be in Actions worthy of them&mdash; And for the Gentlemen of the College, Sir, no In&s;inuation &s;hall make me dread ill U&s;age from tho&s;e, who&s;e Birth and Education will never &s;uf|fer 'em to hurt the Innocent, nor can I affront 'em with &s;o ungenteel a Thought, that they will be the Tools of your wrong plac'd Re&s;entment.&mdash; Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> your Behaviour has extorted this from me, and as your Con&s;cience mu&s;t tell you, I never meant you the lea&s;t Injury, &s;hould you by any little Art aim thro' Pique or Pa&s;&s;ion, unho&s;pi|tably to hurt a Stranger, it would be an Act that wants a Name, and require &s;uch Language to an|&s;wer, as would but ill become the Mouth of a Gen|tleman, or be fitting for the Ears of the Publick.</P>
<P>As my Stay here will be very &s;hort, I but de|&s;ire (what I will not doubt meeting with) a can|did Reception for the few Nights I have to play, from the good-natur'd Town, who&s;e pa&s;t Favours I am proud of; to confe&s;s them is but an Act of Gratitude: Nor will I therefore think my &s;elf liable to the Imputation of a boa&s;ting Vanity.&mdash;Let me, Mr. <HI>Sheridan,</HI> give you this friendly Caution,&mdash;Do not run into an Er|ror mo&s;t young Men, in our Bu&s;ine&s;s, have been
<PB N="14" REF="13" MS="y">
too guilty of, who think their Merits are but barely paid, when their Reception is mo&s;t fa|vourable; and take that as their Due, which is mo&s;tly the Effect of a generous Di&s;po&s;ition, in the Town, to encourage, and &s;upport, a ri&s;ing Genius whenever it appears.&mdash;Tho' People may be as fond of &s;uch, for a while, as Gallants are of a new Mi&s;tre&s;s, yet, if Vanity and Caprice prevail, in &s;uch Performer, grown wild and wan|ton with Succe&s;s, they know when to withdraw their Favours, nor is it ea&s;y to regain them.&mdash; If I ever &s;ee you in <HI>England,</HI> I'll be mo&s;t un|mercifully reveng'd of you, for your Mi&s;takes towards me; and will ab&s;olutely endeavour, to make your Reception there, as plea&s;ing to you, as you may have wi&s;h'd, mine &s;hould have been here di&s;plea&s;ing to me: But, let us now mind our Bu&s;ine&s;s, and no more trouble the Publick with our Theatrical-Important-Nothings.&mdash; They will but laugh at us for our Pains.</P>
