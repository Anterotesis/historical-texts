<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following work is the &s;ub&s;tance of various &s;peculations, that occa&s;ionally amu&s;ed the author, and enlivened his lei&s;ure-hours. It is not intended for the learned; they are above it: nor for the vulgar; they are below it. It is intended for men, who, equally removed from the corruption of opu|lence, and from the depre&s;&s;ion of bodily la|bour, are bent on u&s;eful knowledge; who, even in the delirium of youth, feel the dawn of patrioti&s;m, and who, in riper years, enjoy its meridian warmth. To &s;uch men this work is dedicated; and that they may pro|fit by it, is the author's ardent wi&s;h, and probably will be while any &s;pirit remains in him to form a wi&s;h.</P>
<P>May not he hope, that this work, child of his grey hairs, will &s;urvive, and bear te&s;ti|mony for him to good men, that even a la|borious calling, which left him not many lei&s;ure-hours, never bani&s;hed from his mind, that he would little de&s;erve to be of the human &s;pecies, were he indifferent about his fellow-creatures:
<Q><L><HI>Homo &s;um: humani nihil a me alienum puto,</HI></L></Q></P>

Mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects handled in the follow|ing &s;heets admit but of probable rea&s;oning; which is not a little &s;lippery, as, with re&s;pect to many rea&s;onings of that kind, it is diffi|cult to pronounce, what degree of conviction they ought to produce. It is ea&s;y to form plau&s;ible arguments; but to form &s;uch as will &s;tand the te&s;t of time, is not always ea&s;y. I could amu&s;e the reader with numerous ex|amples of conjectural arguments, which, fair at a di&s;tant view, vani&s;h like a cloud on a near approach. In the fir&s;t &s;ketch of this book, not to go farther, he will find record|ed more than one example. The dread of being mi&s;led by &s;uch arguments filled the author with anxiety; and, after his utmo&s;t attention, he can but faintly hope, that he has not often wandered far from truth.</P>
<P>Above thirty years ago he began to col|lect materials for a natural hi&s;tory of man; and, in the vigour of youth, did not think the undertaking too bold, even for a &s;ingle hand. He has di&s;covered of late, that his utmo&s;t abilities are &s;carce &s;ufficient for exe|cuting a few imperfect &s;ketches.</P>

<HEAD>DIVERSITY of MEN and of LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER there be different races of men, or whether all men be of one race, without any difference but what proceeds from climate or other accident, is a profound que&s;|tion of natural hi&s;tory, which remains &s;till unde|termined after all that has been &s;aid upon it. As the que&s;tion is of moment in tracing the hi&s;tory of man, I purpo&s;e to contribute my mite; and in or|der to admit all the light po&s;&s;ible, a view of brute animals as divided into different races or kinds, will make a proper introduction.</P>
<P>As many Animals contribute to our well-being, by labouring for us, or by affording us food and rai|ment, and as many are noxious; our terre&s;trial ha|bitation
<PB N="2" REF="14">
would be little comfortable, had we no means but experience for di&s;tingui&s;hing the one &s;ort from the other. Were each individual animal a &s;pecies by it&s;elf, (indulging the expre&s;&s;ion), dif|fering from every other individual, a man would fini&s;h his days without acquiring &s;o much knowledge of animals as is nece&s;&s;ary even for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation: experience would give him no aid with re&s;pect to any individual of which he has no experience. The Deity has left none of his works imperfect. Animals are formed of different kinds, each kind having a figure and a temper peculiar to it&s;elf. Great uniformity is di&s;covered among animals of the &s;ame kind; no le&s;s variety among animals of different kinds: and to prevent confu&s;ion, kinds are di&s;tingui&s;hed externally by figure, air, manner, &s;o clearly as not to e&s;cape even a child<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And out of the ground the Lord God formed every bea&s;t of the field and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to &s;ee what he would call them. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every bea&s;t of the field."</Q> Gen. ii. 19.</NOTE>. To com|plete this curious &s;y&s;tem, we have an innate &s;en&s;e, that each kind is endued with properties peculiar to it&s;elf; and that the&s;e properties belong to every individual of the kind<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Elements of Critici&s;m, edit. 4. vol. 2. p. 490.</NOTE>. Our road to the know|ledge of animals is thus wonderfully abridged: the experience we have of the di&s;po&s;ition and proper|ties of any animal, is applied without he&s;itation to every one of the kind. By that &s;en&s;e, a child, fa|miliar with one dog, is fond of others that re&s;em|ble it: an European, upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of a cow in Africa, &s;trokes it as gentle and innocent; and an African avoids a tiger in Hindo&s;tan as at home.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="15">
If the foregoing theory be well founded, neither experience nor argument is required to prove, that a hor&s;e is not an a&s;s, or that a monkey is not a man<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See M. Buffon's natural hi&s;tory.</NOTE>. Some animals indeed are &s;o &s;imilar, as to render it uncertain whether they be not radically of the &s;ame &s;pecies. But in every &s;uch in&s;tance there is little need to be &s;olicitous; for I venture to af|firm, that both will be found gentle or fierce, whole&s;ome food or unwhole&s;ome. Such que&s;tions may be curious, but they are of no u&s;e.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of brute animals into different kinds, is not more u&s;eful to man than to the animals them|&s;elves. A bea&s;t of prey would be ill fitted for its &s;tation, if nature did not teach it what creatures to attack, and what to avoid. A rabbit is the prey of the ferret. Pre&s;ent a rabbit, even dead, to a young ferret that never had &s;een a rabbit; it throws it&s;elf upon the body, and bites it with fury. A hound has the &s;ame in&s;tinct with re&s;pect to a hare, and mo&s;t dogs have it. Unle&s;s directed by nature, in|nocent animals would not know their enemy till they were in its clutches. A hare flies with pre|cipitation from the fir&s;t dog it ever &s;aw; and a chicken, upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of a kite, cowers un|der its dam. Social animals, without &s;cruple, con|nect with their own kind, and as readily avoid others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The populace about Smyrna have a cruel amu&s;e|ment. They lay the eggs of a hen in a &s;tork's ne&s;t. Upon &s;eeing the chickens, the male in amazement calls his neighbouring &s;torks together; who, to revenge the affront put upon them, de&s;troy the poor innocent fe|male; while he bewails his misfortune in heavy lamen|tation.</NOTE>. Birds are not afraid of quadrupeds; not even of a cat, till they are taught by experience that a cat is their enemy. They appear to be as little afraid
<PB N="4" REF="16">
of a man naturally; and upon that account are far from being &s;hy when left unmole&s;ted. In the un|inhabited i&s;land of Vi&s;ia Grand&eacute;, one of the Phi|lippines, Kempfer &s;ays, that birds may be taken with the hand. Hawks, in &s;ome of the South-&s;ea i&s;lands, are equally tame. At Port Egmont in the Falkland I&s;lands, gee&s;e, far from being &s;hy, may be knocked down with a &s;tick. The birds that in|habit certain rocks hanging over the &s;ea in the i&s;land of Annabon, take food readily out of a man's hand. In Arabia Felix, foxes and apes &s;how no fear of man; the inhabitants of hot countries having no notion of hunting. In the uninhabited i&s;land Be|ring, adjacent to Kam&s;katka, the foxes are &s;o little &s;hy that they &s;carce go out of a man's way. Doth not this ob&s;ervation &s;ugge&s;t a final cau&s;e? A par|tridge, a plover, a phea&s;ant, would be lo&s;t to man for food, were they naturally as much afraid of him as of a hawk or a kite.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of animals into different kinds, &s;erves another purpo&s;e, not le&s;s important than tho&s;e mentioned; which is, to fit them for different cli|mates. We learn from experience, that no ani|mal nor vegetable is fitted for every climate; and from experience we al&s;o learn, that there is no ani|mal or vegetable but what is fitted for &s;ome climate, where it grows to perfection. Even in the torrid zone, plants of a cold country are found upon mountains where plants of a hot country will not grow; and the height of a mountain may be de|termined with tolerable preci&s;ion from the plants it produces. Wheat is not an indigenous plant in Britain; no farmer is ignorant that foreign &s;eed is requi&s;ite to pre&s;erve the plant in vigour. To pre|vent flax from degenerating in Scotland and Ireland, great quantities of foreign &s;eed are annually im|ported. A camel is peculiarly fitted for the burn|ing &s;ands of Arabia; and Lapland would be unin|habitable
<PB N="5" REF="17">
but for rain-deer, an animal &s;o entirely fitted for piercing cold, that it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t even in a temperate climate. Arabian and Barbary hor&s;es degenerate in Britain; and to pre&s;erve the breed in &s;ome degree of perfection, frequent &s;upplies from their original climate are requi&s;ite. Spani&s;h hor&s;es degenerate in Mexico, but improve in Chili; hav|ing more vigour and &s;wiftne&s;s there than even the Andalu&s;ian race, who&s;e offspring they are. Our dunghill-fowl, imported originally from a warm country in A&s;ia, are not hardened, even after many centuries, to bear the cold of this country like birds originally native: the hen lays few or no eggs in winter, unle&s;s in a hou&s;e warmed with fire. The de&s;erts of Zaara and Biledulgerid in Africa, may be properly termed the native country of lions: there they grow to nine feet long and five feet high. Lions in the &s;outh of Africa toward the Cape of Good Hope, grow but to five feet and a half long and to three and a half high. A breed of lions tran&s;planted from the latter to the former, would ri&s;e to the full &s;ize; and &s;ink to the &s;maller &s;ize, if tran&s;planted from the former to the latter.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve the different &s;pecies of animals en|tire, as far as nece&s;&s;ary, Providence is careful to prevent a mixed breed. Few animals of different &s;pecies copulate together. Some may be brought to copulate, but without effect; and &s;ome produce a mongrel, a mule for example, which &s;eldom pro|creates, if at all. In &s;ome few in&s;tances, where a mixture of &s;pecies is harmle&s;s, procreation goes on without limitation. All the different &s;pecies of the dog kind copulate together, and the mongrels produced generate others without end. But dogs are by their nature companions to men; and Providence pro|bably has permitted a mixture, in order that every man may have a dog to his liking.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="18">
M. Buffon in his natural hi&s;tory borrows from Ray<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;dom of God in the works of creation.</NOTE> a very artificial rule for a&s;certaining the different &s;pecies of animals: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Any two animals that can procreate together, and who&s;e i&s;&s;ue can al&s;o procreate, are of the &s;ame &s;pecies<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Octavo edit. vol. 8. p. 104. and in many other parts.</NOTE>."</Q> A hor&s;e and an a&s;s can procreate together; but they are not, &s;ays he, of the &s;ame &s;pecies, becau&s;e their i&s;&s;ue, a mule, cannot procreate. He applies that rule to the human race; holding all men to be of one race or &s;pecies, becau&s;e a man and a woman, however different in &s;ize, in &s;hape, in complexion, can procreate together without end. And by the &s;ame rule he holds all dogs to be of one &s;pecies. With re&s;pect to other animals, the rule &s;hould pa&s;s without oppo&s;ition from me; but as it al&s;o re&s;pects man, the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent enquiry, I propo&s;e to examine it with attention. Providence, it is true, hath prevented confu&s;ion; for in mo&s;t in|&s;tances it hath with-held from animals of different &s;pecies a power of procreating together; but as our author has not attempted to prove that &s;uch re&s;traint is univer&s;al without a &s;ingle exception, his rule is evidently, a petitio principii. Why may not two animals different in &s;pecies produce a mixed breed? Buffon mu&s;t &s;ay, that by a law of nature animals of different &s;pecies never produce a mixed breed. But has he proved this to be a law of na|ture? On the contrary, he more than once men|tions &s;everal exceptions. He admits the &s;heep and the goat to be of a different &s;pecies; and yet we have his authority for affirming, that a he-goat and a ewe produce a mixed breed which generate for ever<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vol. 10. p. 138.</NOTE>. The camel and the dromedary, tho'
<PB N="7" REF="19">
nearly related, are however no le&s;s di&s;tinct than the hor&s;e and the a&s;s. The dromedary is le&s;s than the camel, more &s;lender, and remarkably more &s;wift of foot: it has but one bunch on its back, the ca|mel has two; the race is more numerous than that of the camel, and more widely &s;pread. One would not de&s;ire di&s;tingui&s;hing marks more &s;atisfying; and yet the&s;e two &s;pecies propagate together no le&s;s freely than the different races of men and of dogs. Buffon indeed, with re&s;pect to the camel and dromedary, endeavours to &s;ave his credit, by a di&s;tinction without a difference. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They are,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"one &s;pecies; but their races are diffe|rent, and have been &s;o pa&s;t all memory<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vol. 10. p. 1.</NOTE>."</Q> Does this &s;ay more than that the camel and the dromedary are different &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus? which al&s;o holds true of the different &s;pecies of men and of dogs. If our author will permit me to carry back to the creation the camel and the dro|medary as two di&s;tinct races, I de&s;ire no other conce&s;&s;ion. He admits no fewer than ten kinds of goats, vi&s;ibly di&s;tingui&s;hable, which al&s;o propagate together; but &s;ays that the&s;e are varieties only, tho' permanent and unchangeable. No difficulty is un&s;urmountable if words be allowed to pa&s;s without meaning. Nor does he even pre&s;erve any con&s;i&s;tency in his opinions: tho' in di&s;tingui&s;h|ing a hor&s;e from an a&s;s, he affirms the mule they generate to be barren, yet afterward, entirely for|getting his rule, he admits the direct contrary<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vol. 12. p. 223.</NOTE>. At that rate a hor&s;e and an a&s;s are of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Did it never once enter into the mind of this author, that the human race would be &s;trangely imperfect, if they were unable to di&s;tingui&s;h a man
<PB N="8" REF="20">
from a monkey, or a hare from a hedge-hog, till it were known whether they can procreate to|gether?</P>
<P>But it &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary after all to urge any argument again&s;t the foregoing rule, which M. Buffon him&s;elf inadvertently abandons as to all ani|mals, men and dogs excepted. We are indebted to him for a remark, That not a &s;ingle animal of the torrid zone is common to the old world and to the new. But how does he verify his remark? Does he ever think of trying whether &s;uch animals can procreate together? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They are,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of different kinds, having no &s;uch re&s;emblance as to make us pronounce them to be of the &s;ame kind. Linnaeus and Bri&s;&s;on,"</Q> he adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"have very improperly given the name of the camel to the lama and the pacos of Peru. So apparent is the difference, that other writers cla&s;s the&s;e animals with &s;heep. Wool however is the only circum&s;tance in which a pacos re&s;embles a &s;heep: nor doth the lama re&s;emble a camel ex|cept in length of neck."</Q> He di&s;tingui&s;heth in the &s;ame manner, the true A&s;iatic tiger from &s;everal American animals that bear the &s;ame name.

<PB N="9" REF="21">
certain tribes differ apparently from each other, not le&s;s than the lama and pacos from the camel or from the &s;heep, nor le&s;s than the true tiger from the American animals of that name. Which of his rules are we to follow? Mu&s;t we apply different rules to different animals? and to what animals are we to apply the different rules? For proving that dogs were created of different kinds, what better evidence can be expected than that the kinds continue di&s;tinct to this day? Our author pretends to derive the ma&s;tiff, the bull-dog, the hound, the greyhound, the terrier, the water-dog, &amp;c. all of them from the prickt-ear &s;hepherd's cur. Now, admitting the progeny of the original male and female cur to have &s;uffered every po&s;&s;ible alte|ration from climate, food, dome&s;tication; the re|&s;ult would be endle&s;s varieties, &s;o as that no one individual &s;hould re&s;emble another. Whence then are derived the different &s;pecies of dogs above men|tioned, or the different races or varieties, as M. Buffon is plea&s;ed to name them? Uniformity and permanency mu&s;t be a law in their nature, for they never can be the production of chance. There are mongrels, it is true, among dogs, from want of choice, or from a depraved appetite: but as all animals prefer their own kind, mongrels are few compared with animals of a true breed. There are mongrels al&s;o among men: the &s;everal kinds however continue di&s;tinct; and probably will &s;o continue for ever.</P>
<P>The celebrated Linnaeus, in&s;tead of de&s;cribing every animal according to its kind as Adam our fir&s;t parent did, and Buffon copying from him, has wandered wonderfully far from nature in cla&s;&s;ing animals. He di&s;tributes them into &s;ix cla&s;&s;es, viz. Mammalia, Aves, Amphibia, Pi&s;ces, In&s;ecta, Vermes. The Mammalia are di&s;tributed into &s;even orders, chiefly from their teeth, viz. Pri|mates,
<PB N="10" REF="22">
Bruta, Ferae, Glires, Pecora, Belluae, Cete. And the Primates are Homo, Simia, Le|mur, Ve&s;pertilio. What may have been his pur|po&s;e in cla&s;&s;ing animals &s;o, I cannot gue&s;s, if it be not to enable us, from the nipples and teeth of any particular animal, to know where it lies in his book. It re&s;embles the cla&s;&s;ing books in a library by &s;ize, or by binding, without regard to the con|tents. It may &s;erve as a &s;ort of dictionary; but to no other purpo&s;e &s;o far as I can di&s;cover. How whim&s;ical is it to cla&s;s together animals that nature hath widely &s;eparated, a man for example and a bat? What will a plain man think of a method of cla&s;&s;ing that denies a whale to be a fi&s;h? Be&s;ide, one would wi&s;h to know why in cla&s;&s;ing animals he confines him&s;elf to the nipples and the teeth, when there are many other di&s;tingui&s;hing marks. Animals are not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hable by their tails; long tails, &s;hort tails, no tails: nor le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hable by their hands, &s;ome having four hands, &s;ome two, &s;ome none, &amp;c. &amp;c. At the &s;ame time, if any &s;olid in&s;truction is to be acquired from &s;uch cla&s;&s;ing, I &s;hall li&s;ten, not only with attention, but with &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>And now more particularly of man, after di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing other animals. If the only rule afforded by nature for cla&s;&s;ing animals can be depended on, there are different races of men as well as of dogs: a ma&s;tiff differs not more from a &s;paniel, than a white man from a negro, or a Laplander from a Dane. And if we have any faith in Providence, it ought to be &s;o. Plants were created of different kinds to fit them for different climates, and &s;o were brute animals. Certain it is, that all men are not fitted equally for every climate. There is &s;carce a climate but what is natural to &s;ome men, where they pro&s;per and flouri&s;h; and there is not a cli|mate but where &s;ome men degenerate. Doth not
<PB N="11" REF="23">
then analogy lead us to conclude, that as there are different climates on the face of this globe, &s;o there are different races of men fitted for the&s;e different climates? The inhabitants of the frozen regions of the north, men, birds, bea&s;ts, fi&s;h, are all of them provided with a quantity of fat which guards them again&s;t cold. Even the trees are full of ro&s;in. The E&s;quimaux inhabit a bitter cold country; and their blood and their breath are remarkably warm. The i&s;land St. Thomas, under the line, is ex|tremely foggy; and the natives are fitted for that &s;ort of weather, by the rigidity of their fibres. The fog is di&s;pelled in July and Augu&s;t by dry winds; which give vigour to Europeans, who&s;e fibres are relaxed by the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;|phere, as by a warm bath. The natives, on the contrary, who are not fitted for a dry air, have more di&s;ea&s;es in July and Augu&s;t than during the other ten months. On the other hand, in&s;tances are without number of men degenerating in a cli|mate to which they are not fitted by nature; and I know not of a &s;ingle in&s;tance where in &s;uch a climate people have retained their original vigour. Several European colonies have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the torrid zone of America more than two centuries; and yet even that length of time has not familia|ri&s;ed them to the climate: they cannot bear heat like the original inhabitants, nor like negroes tran&s;|planted from a country equally hot: they are far from equalling in vigour of mind or body the na|tions from which they &s;prung. The Spani&s;h inha|bitants of Carthagena in South America lo&s;e their vigour and colour in a few months. Their motion is languid; and their words are pronounced with a low voice, and with long and frequent intervals. Europeans who are born in Batavia &s;oon degene|rate. Scarce one of them has talents &s;ufficient to bear a part in the admini&s;tration. There is not an
<PB N="12" REF="24">
office of tru&s;t or figure but what is filled with na|tive Europeans. Some Portugue&s;e, who have been for ages &s;ettled on the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Congo, retain &s;carce the appearance of men. South Carolina, e&s;pecially about Charle&s;town, is extremely hot, having no &s;ea-breeze to cool the air. Europeans there die &s;o fa&s;t that they have not time to dege|nerate. Even in Jamaica, tho' more temperate by a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of land and &s;ea-breezes, re|cruits from Britain are nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the numbers. The climate of the northern provinces re&s;embles our own, and population goes on with great rapidity.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that there are different races of men fitted by nature for different climates. Upon a thorough examination another fact will perhaps al&s;o appear, that the natural productions of each climate make the mo&s;t whole&s;ome food for the people who are fitted to live in it. Between the tropics, the natives live chiefly on fruits, &s;eeds, and roots; and it is the opinion of the mo&s;t know|ing naturali&s;ts, that &s;uch food is of all the mo&s;t whole&s;ome for the torrid zone, comprehending the hot plants, which grow there to perfection, and tend greatly to fortify the &s;tomach. In a tempe|rate climate, a mixture of animal and vegetable food is held to be the mo&s;t whole&s;ome; and there both animals and vegetables abound. In a cold climate, animals are in plenty, but &s;carce any vegetables that can &s;erve for food to man. What phy&s;icians pronounce upon that head, I know not; but if we dare venture a conjecture from analogy, animal food will be found the mo&s;t whole&s;ome for &s;uch as are made by nature to live in a cold cli|mate.</P>
<P>M. Buffon, from the rule, That animals which can procreate together, and who&s;e progeny can al&s;o procreate, are of one &s;pecies, concludes, that
<PB N="13" REF="25">
all men are of one race or &s;pecies; and endeavours to &s;upport that favourite opinion by a&s;cribing to the climate, to food, or to other accidental cau&s;es, all the varieties that are found among men. But is he &s;eriou&s;ly of opinion, that any operation of climate, or of other accidental cau&s;e, can account for the copper colour and &s;mooth chin univer&s;al among the Americans, the prominence of the Pudenda univer&s;al among Hottentot women, or the black nipple no le&s;s univer&s;al among female Samoides? The thick fogs of the i&s;land St. Tho|mas may relax the fibres of the natives, but can|not make them more rigid than they are naturally. Whence then the difference with re&s;pect to rigidity of fibres between them and Europeans, but from original nature? It is in vain to a&s;cribe to the cli|mate the low &s;tature of the E&s;quimaux, the &s;mall|ne&s;s of their feet, or the overgrown &s;ize of their head. It is equally in vain to a&s;cribe to climate the low &s;tature of the Laplanders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By late accounts it appears that the Laplanders are only degenerated Tartars; and that they and the Hun|garians originally &s;prung from the &s;ame breed of men, and from the &s;ame country. Pere Hel, the Je&s;uit, an Hungarian, made lately this di&s;covery, when &s;ent to Lapland for making &s;ome a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations.</NOTE>, or their ugly vi&s;age. Lapland is indeed piercingly cold; but &s;o is Finland, and the northern parts of Norway, the inhabitants of which are tall, comely, and well proportioned. The black colour of negroes, thick lips, flat no&s;e, cri&s;ped woolly hair, and rank &s;mell, di&s;tingui&s;h them from every other race of men. The Aby&s;&s;inians on the contrary are tall and well made, their complexion a brown olive, features well proportioned, eyes large and of a &s;parkling black, thin lips, a no&s;e rather high than flat. There is no &s;uch difference of climate between
<PB N="14" REF="26">
Aby&s;&s;inia and Negroland as to produce the&s;e &s;trik|ing differences. At any rate, there mu&s;t be a con|&s;iderable mixture both of &s;oil and climate in the&s;e exten&s;ive regions; and yet not the lea&s;t mixture is perceived in the people.</P>
<P>If the climate have any commanding influence, it mu&s;t be chiefly di&s;played upon the complexion; and in that article accordingly our author exults. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Man,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"white in Europe, black in Africa, yellow in A&s;ia, and red in America, is &s;till the &s;ame animal, tinged only with the colour of the climate. Where the heat is ex|ce&s;&s;ive, as in Guinea and Senegal, the people are perfectly black; where le&s;s exce&s;&s;ive, as in Aby&s;&s;inia, the people are le&s;s black; where it is more temperate, as in Barbary and in Arabia, they are brown; and where mild, as in Europe and Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, they are fair<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Book 5.</NOTE>."</Q> But here he triumphs without a victory: he is forced to acknowledge, that the Samoides, Laplanders, and Greenlanders, are of a &s;allow complexion; for which he has the following &s;alvo, that the extre|mities of heat and of cold produce nearly the &s;ame effects on the &s;kin. But he is totally &s;ilent upon a fact that &s;ingly overturns his whole &s;y&s;tem of co|lour, viz. that all Americans without exception are of a copper colour, tho' in that va&s;t continent there is every variety of climate. Neither doth the black colour of &s;ome Africans, nor the brown colour of others, corre&s;pond to the climate. The people of the de&s;ert of Zaara, commonly termed Lower Ethiopia, tho' expo&s;ed to the vertical rays of the &s;un in a burning &s;and yielding not even to Guinea in heat, are of a tawny colour, far from being jet black like negroes. The natives of Monomotapa are perfectly black, with cri&s;ped
<PB N="15" REF="27">
woolly hair, tho' the &s;outhern parts of that exten|&s;ive kingdom are in a temperate climate, very different from that of Guinea. And the Caffres, even tho&s;e who live near the Cape of Good Hope, are the &s;ame &s;ort of people. The heat of Aby&s;&s;i|nia approacheth nearer to that of Guinea; and yet, as mentioned above, the inhabitants are not black. Nor &s;hall our author's ingenious ob&s;erva|tion concerning the extremities of heat and cold purcha&s;e him impunity with re&s;pect to the &s;allow complexion of the Samoides, Laplanders, and Greenlanders. The Finlanders and northern Norwegians live in a climate not le&s;s cold than that of the people mentioned; and yet are fair beyond other Europeans. I &s;ay more, there are many in&s;tances of races of people pre&s;erving their original colour in climates very different from their own; but not a &s;ingle in&s;tance of the contrary &s;o far as I can learn. There have been four com|plete generations of negroes in Pen&s;ylvania, with|out any vi&s;ible change of colour: they continue jet black as originally. Shaw, in his travels through Barbary, mentions a people inhabiting the moun|tains of Aure&s;s bordering upon Algiers on the &s;outh, who appeared to be of a different race from the Moors. Their complexion, far from &s;warthy, is fair and ruddy; and their hair a deep yellow, in&s;tead of being dark as among the neighbouring Moors. He conjectures them to be a remnant of the Vandals, perhaps the tribe mentioned by Pro|copius in his fir&s;t book of the Vandalic war. If the European complexion be proof again&s;t a hot climate for a thou&s;and years, I pronounce that it will never yield to climate. In the &s;uburbs of Cochin, a town in Malabar, there is a colony of indu&s;trious Jews of the the &s;ame complexion they have in Europe. They pretend that they were e&s;tabli&s;hed there during the captivity of Babylon:
<PB N="16" REF="28">
it is unque&s;tionable that they have been many ages in that country. Tho&s;e who a&s;cribe all to the &s;un, ought to con&s;ider how little probable it is, that the colour it impre&s;&s;es on the parents &s;hould be com|municated to their infant children, who never &s;aw the &s;un: I &s;hould be as &s;oon induced to believe with a German naturali&s;t, who&s;e name has e&s;caped me, that the negro colour is owing to an ancient cu&s;tom in Africa of dying the &s;kin black. Let a European for years expo&s;e him&s;elf to the &s;un in a hot climate, till he be quite brown, his children will neverthele&s;s have the &s;ame complexion with tho&s;e in Europe. The Hottentots are continually at work, and have been for ages, to darken their complexion; but that operation has no effect on their children. From the action of the &s;un is it po&s;&s;ible to explain, why a negro, like a European, is born with a ruddy &s;kin, which turns jet black the eighth or ninth day?</P>
<P>Different tribes are di&s;tingui&s;hable, not le&s;s by internal di&s;po&s;ition than by external figure. Nations are for the mo&s;t part &s;o blended by war, by com|merce, or by other means, that vain would be the attempt to trace out an original character in any cultivated nation. But there are &s;avage tribes, which, &s;o far as can be di&s;covered, continue to this day pure without mixture, who act by in&s;tinct not art, who have not learned to di&s;gui&s;e their pa&s;&s;ions: to &s;uch I confine the inquiry. There is no propen&s;ity in human nature more general than aver&s;ion to &s;trangers, as will be made evident in a following &s;ketch<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Book 2. &s;ketch 1.</NOTE>. And yet &s;ome nations mu&s;t be excepted, not indeed many in number, who are remarkably kind to &s;trangers; by which circum|&s;tance they appear to be of a peculiar race. In order to &s;et the exceptions in a clear light, a few
<PB N="17" REF="29">
in&s;tances &s;hall be premi&s;ed of the general propen|&s;ity. The nations that may be the mo&s;t relied on for an original character, are i&s;landers at a di&s;tance from the continent and from each other. Among &s;uch, great variety of character is found. Some i&s;lands adjacent to New Guinea, are inhabited by negroes, a bold, mi&s;chievous, untractable race; always ready to attack &s;trangers when they ap|proach the &s;hore. The people of New Zealand are of a large &s;ize and of a hoar&s;e voice. They appeared &s;hy according to Ta&s;man's account. Some of them however ventured on board in order to trade; but finding opportunity, they &s;urpri&s;ed &s;even of his men in a &s;hallop, and without the &s;lighte&s;t provocation killed three of them, the re&s;t having e&s;caped by &s;wimming. The i&s;land called Recreation, 16th degree &s;outhern latitude and 148th of longitude we&s;t from London, was di&s;co|vered in Roggewein's voyage. Upon &s;ight of the &s;hips, the natives flocked to the &s;hore with long pikes. The crew made good their landing, having beat back the natives by a continued fire of mu&s;|kets; who, returning after a &s;hort interval, ac|cepted pre&s;ents of beads, &s;mall looking-gla&s;&s;es, and other trinkets, without &s;hewing the lea&s;t fear: they even a&s;&s;i&s;ted the crew in gathering herbs for tho&s;e who were afflicted with the &s;curvy. Some of the crew traver&s;ing the i&s;land in great &s;ecurity, and tru&s;ting to &s;ome of the natives who led the way, were carried into a deep valley &s;urrounded with rocks; where they were in&s;tantly attacked on every &s;ide with large &s;tones; and with difficulty made their e&s;cape, but not without leaving &s;everal dead upon the field. In Commodore Byron's voy|age to the South &s;ea, an i&s;land was di&s;covered named Di&s;appointment. The &s;hore was filled with natives in arms to prevent landing. They were black, and without cloathing, except what covered
<PB N="18" REF="30">
the parts that nature teaches to hide. But a &s;pe|cimen is &s;ufficient here, as the &s;ubject will be fully illu&s;trated in the &s;ketch referred to above.</P>
<P>The kindne&s;s of &s;ome tribes to &s;trangers de&s;erves more attention, being not a little &s;ingular. Gon|neville, commander of a French &s;hip in a voyage to the Ea&s;t Indies in the year 1503, was probably the fir&s;t European who vi&s;ited the Terra Au&s;tralis Incognita; being driven thither by a tempe&s;t. He continued &s;ix months in that country, while his ve&s;&s;el was refitting; and the manners he de&s;cribes were in all appearance original. The natives had not made a greater progre&s;s in the arts of life than the &s;avage Canadians have done; ill clothed; and wor&s;e lodged, having no light in their cabins but what came in through a hole in the roof. They were divided into &s;mall tribes, governed each by a king; who, tho' neither better clothed nor lodged than others, had power of life and death over his &s;ubjects. They were a &s;imple and peaceable people; and in a manner wor&s;hipped the French, providing them with nece&s;&s;aries, and in return thankfully receiving knives, hatchets, &s;mall look|ing-gla&s;&s;es, and other &s;uch baubles. In a part of California the men go naked; and are fond of feathers and &s;hells. They are governed by a king, with great mildne&s;s; and of all &s;avages are the mo&s;t humane, even to &s;trangers. An i&s;land di&s;|covered in the South &s;ea by Ta&s;man, 21&s;t degree of &s;outhern latitude and 177th of longitude we&s;t from London, was called by him Am&s;terdam. The natives, who had no arms offen&s;ive nor de|fen&s;ive, treated the Dutch with great civility, except in being given to pilfering. At no great di&s;tance another i&s;land was di&s;covered, named Annamocha by the natives, and Rotterdam by Ta&s;man; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a people re&s;embling tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned, particularly in having no arms.
<PB N="19" REF="31">
The Dutch, &s;ailing round the i&s;land, &s;aw abun|dance of cocoa-trees planted in rows, with many other fruit-bearing trees, kept in excellent order. Commodore Roggewein, commander of a Dutch fleet, di&s;covered, an. 1721, a new i&s;land in the South &s;ea; inhabited by a people lively, active, and &s;wift of foot; of a &s;weet and mode&s;t deport|ment: but timorous and faint-hearted; for having on their knees pre&s;ented &s;ome refre&s;hments to the Dutch, they retired with precipitation. Numbers of idols cut in &s;tone were &s;et up along the coa&s;t, in the figure of men with large ears, and the head covered with a crown; the whole nicely propor|tioned and highly fini&s;hed. They fled for refuge to the&s;e idols: and they could do no better; for they had no weapons either offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive. Neither was there any appearance of government or &s;ubordination; for they all &s;poke and acted with equal freedom. This i&s;land, &s;ituated 28 degrees 30 minutes &s;outhern latitude, and about 115 de|grees of longitude we&s;t from London, is by the Dutch called Ea&s;ter or Pa&s;ch I&s;land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The women were very loving, enticing the Dutch|men by every female art to the mo&s;t intimate familia|rity.</NOTE>. The Commodore directing his cour&s;e north-we&s;t, di&s;|covered in the &s;outhern latitude of 12 degrees, and in the longitude of 190, a clu&s;ter of other i&s;lands, planted with variety of fruit-trees, and bearing herbs, corn, and roots, in plenty. When the &s;hips approached the &s;hore, the inhabitants came in their canoes with fi&s;h, cocoa-nuts, Indian figs, and other refre&s;hments; for which they received &s;mall looking-gla&s;&s;es, &s;trings of beads, and other toys. The&s;e i&s;lands were well peopled: many thou&s;ands thronged to the &s;hore to &s;ee the &s;hips, the men being armed with bows and arrows, and appearing
<PB N="20" REF="32">
to be governed by a chieftain: they were of the &s;ame complexion with that of Europe, only a little more &s;un-burnt. They were bri&s;k and lively, treating one another with civility; and in their behaviour expre&s;&s;ing nothing wild nor &s;avage. Their bodies were not painted; but hand&s;omely clothed, from the middle downward, with &s;ilk fringes in neat folds. Large hats &s;creened their faces from the &s;un, and collars of odoriferous flowers &s;urrounded their necks. The face of the country is charming, being finely diver&s;ified with hills and vallies. Some of the i&s;lands are ten miles in circumference, &s;ome fifteen, and &s;ome twenty. The hi&s;torian adds, that the&s;e i&s;landers are in all re&s;pects the mo&s;t civilized and the be&s;t tempered people they di&s;covered in the South &s;ea. Far from being afraid, they treated the Dutch with great kindne&s;s; and expre&s;&s;ed much regret at their de|parture. The&s;e i&s;lands got the name of Bowman's i&s;lands, from the captain of the Tienhoven, who di&s;covered them. In Commodore Byron's voyage to the South &s;ea, while they were pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treights of Magellan, &s;ome natives approached in their canoes; and upon invitation came on board, without fear, or even &s;hyne&s;s. They at the &s;ame time appeared gro&s;sly &s;tupid; and parti|cularly could not comprehend the u&s;e of knives, offered to them in a pre&s;ent. In another part of the &s;treights, the natives were highly delighted with the pre&s;ents made them. M. Bougainville, in his voyage round the world, de&s;cribes a people in the &s;treights of Magellan, probably tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned, as of a &s;mall &s;tature, tame and peace|able, having &s;carce any cloathing in a climate bit|terly cold. Commodore Byron di&s;covered another i&s;land in the South &s;ea covered with trees, which was named Byron i&s;land. The inhabitants were neither &s;avage nor &s;hy, trafficking freely with the
<PB N="21" REF="33">
crew, though they &s;eemed addicted to thieving. One of them ventured into the &s;hip. After leav|ing Otaheite, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, &s;ailing we&s;tward, di&s;covered a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, termed by them Society i&s;lands: the natives were ex|tremely civil, and appeared to have no aver&s;ion to &s;trangers. The i&s;land of Oahena, north-we&s;t from that of Otaheite, is a delightful &s;pot; the &s;oil fer|tile, and the &s;hores adorned with fruit-trees of va|rious kinds. The inhabitants are well proportioned, with regular engaging features; the women un|commonly beautiful and delicate. The inhabitants behaved with great ho&s;pitality and probity to the people of the &s;hip in which the&s;e gentlemen made a late voyage round the world.</P>
<P>To find the inhabitants of the&s;e remote i&s;lands differing &s;o widely from the re&s;t of the world as to have no aver&s;ion to &s;trangers, but on the contrary &s;howing great kindne&s;s to the fir&s;t they probably ever &s;aw, is a &s;ingular phenomenon. It is in vain here to talk of climate; becau&s;e in all climates we find an aver&s;ion to &s;trangers. From the in&s;tances given above, let us &s;elect two i&s;lands, or two clu&s;ters of i&s;lands, &s;uppo&s;e for example Bowman's i&s;lands inhabited by Whites, and tho&s;e adjacent to New Guinea inhabited by Blacks. Kindne&s;s to &s;trangers is the national character of the former, and hatred to &s;trangers is the national character of the latter. Virtues and vices as entering into the character of individuals, depend on cau&s;es &s;o va|rious, and &s;o variable, as to give an impre&s;&s;ion of chance more than of de&s;ign. We are not always certain of uniformity in the conduct even of the &s;ame per&s;on; far le&s;s that &s;ons will inherit their father's virtues or vices. In mo&s;t countries, a &s;avage who has no aver&s;ion to &s;trangers, nor to neighbouring clans, would be noted as &s;ingular: to find the &s;ame quality in every one of his chil|dren,
<PB N="22" REF="34">
would be &s;urpri&s;ing: and would be &s;till more &s;o, were it diffu&s;ed widely through a multitude of his de&s;cendents. Yet a family is as nothing com|pared with a whole nation; and when we find kindne&s;s to &s;trangers a national character in certain tribes, we reject with di&s;dain the notion of chance, and perceive intuitively that effects &s;o regular and permanent mu&s;t be owing to a con&s;tant and inva|riable cau&s;e. Such effects cannot be accidental, more than the uniformity of male and female births in all countries and at all times. They cannot be accounted for from education or example, which indeed may contribute to &s;pread a certain fa&s;hion or certain manners, but cannot be their fundamen|tal cau&s;e. Where the greater part of a nation is of one character, education and example may ex|tend it over the whole; but the character of that greater part can have no foundation but nature. What re&s;ource then have we for explaining the oppo&s;ite manners of the i&s;landers above mentioned, but that they are of different races?</P>
<P>The &s;ame doctrine is &s;trongly confirmed upon finding courage or cowardice to be a national cha|racter. Individuals differ widely as to the&s;e; but a national character of courage or cowardice mu&s;t depend on a permanent and invariable cau&s;e. I therefore proceed to in&s;tances of national courage and cowardice, that the reader may judge for him|&s;elf, whether he can di&s;cover any other cau&s;e for &s;uch &s;teady uniformity but diver&s;ity of race.</P>

As in that ob&s;ervation he &s;eems to lay no weight on climate, and as little on original di&s;po&s;ition, it is with regret that my &s;ubject leads me in this public manner to differ from him with re&s;pect to the latter. The charac|ter he gives in general to all &s;avages, is indeed ap|plicable to many &s;avage tribes, our European fore|fathers

in particular; but not to all. It but faintly &s;uits even the North-American &s;avages, whom our author &s;eems to have had in his eye; for in war they carefully avoid open force, relying chiefly on &s;tratagem and &s;urpri&s;e. They value them&s;elves, it is &s;aid, upon &s;aving men; but as that motive was no le&s;s weighty in Europe, and indeed every where, the pronene&s;s of our forefa|thers to open violence vouches for their &s;uperiority in active courage. The following incidents, re|ported by Charlevoix, give no favourable idea of &s;ome North-Americans with regard to that &s;ort of courage. The fort de Vercheres in Canada, be|longing to the French, was in the year 1690 at|tacked by &s;ome Iroquois. They approached &s;ilent|ly, preparing to &s;cale the pali&s;ade, when &s;ome mu&s;ket-&s;hot made them retire. Advancing a &s;e|cond time, they were again repul&s;ed, wondering that they could di&s;cover none but a woman, who was &s;een every where. This was Madame de Vercheres, who appeared as re&s;olute as if &s;upport|ed by a numerous garri&s;on. The hopes of &s;torm|ing a place without men to defend it, occa&s;ion|ed reiterated attacks. After two days &s;iege, they retired, fearing to be intercepted in their retreat. Two years after, a party of the &s;ame nation ap|peared before the fort &s;o unexpectedly, that a girl of fourteen, daughter of the proprietor, had but time to &s;hut the gate. With the young woman there was not a &s;oul but one raw &s;oldier. She &s;hewed her&s;elf with her a&s;&s;i&s;tant, &s;ometimes in one place, &s;ometimes in another; changing her dre&s;s frequently in order to give &s;ome appearance of a garri&s;on, and always fired opportunely. The faint-hearted Iroquois decamped without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But if the Americans abound not with active courage, their pa&s;&s;ive courage is beyond concep|tion. Every writer expatiates upon the torments
<PB N="27" REF="39">
they endure, not only patiently, but with &s;ingu|lar fortitude; deriding their tormentors, and bra|ving their utmo&s;t cruelty. North-American &s;a|vages differ indeed &s;o widely from tho&s;e formerly in Europe, that it is difficult to conceive them to be of the &s;ame race. Pa&s;&s;ive courage they have, even to a wonder; but abound not in active courage: our European &s;ore&s;athers, on the contra|ry, were much more remarkable for active courage than for pa&s;&s;ive. The Kam&s;katkans in every ar|ticle re&s;emble the North-Americans. In war they are full of &s;tratagem, but never attack openly if they can avoid it. When victorious, they murder without mercy, burn their pri&s;oners alive, or tear out their bowels. If they be &s;urrounded, and can|not e&s;cape, they turn de&s;perate, cut the throats of their wives and children, and throw them&s;elves into the mid&s;t of their enemies. And yet the&s;e people are abundantly free. Their want of active cou|rage is the more &s;urpri&s;ing, becau&s;e they make no difficulty of &s;uicide when they &s;all into any di|&s;tre&s;s. But their pa&s;&s;ive courage is equal to that of the Americans: when tortured in order to extort a confe&s;&s;ion, they &s;how the utmo&s;t firm|ne&s;s; and &s;eldom di&s;cover more than what they freely confe&s;s at their fir&s;t examination.</P>
<P>The &s;avages of Guiana are indolent, good-na|tured, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and a little cowardly; tho' they yield not to the North-Americans as to equality and independence. The inhabitants of the Marion or Ladrone i&s;lands live in a &s;tate of perfect equa|lity: every man avenges the injury done to him|&s;elf; and even children are regardle&s;s of their pa|rents. Yet the&s;e people are great cowards; in battle indeed they utter loud &s;houts; but it is more to animate them&s;elves than to terrify the enemy The negroes in the &s;lave-coa&s;t of Guinea are good|natured and obliging; but not remarkable for cou|rage.

<P>The Maca&s;&s;ars, inhabitants of the i&s;land Cele|bes in the torrid zone, differ from all other people. They have active courage above even the fierce&s;t European &s;avages; and they equal the North-Ame|rican &s;avages in pa&s;&s;ive courage. During the reign of Chaw Naraya, King of Siam, a &s;mall party of Maca&s;&s;ars, who were in the king's pay, having revolted, it required a whole army of Siamites to &s;ubdue them. Four Maca&s;&s;ars, taken alive, were cruelly tortured. They were beat to mummy with cudgels, iron pins thru&s;t under their nails, all their fingers broken, the fle&s;h burnt off their arms, and their temples &s;queezed between boards; yet they bore all with unparalleled firmne&s;s. They even refu&s;ed to be converted to Chri&s;tianity, tho' the Je&s;uits upon that occa&s;ion offered to intercede for them. A tiger, let loo&s;e, having fa&s;tened on the foot of one of them, the man never once offered to draw it away. Another, without uttering a word, bore the tiger breaking the bones of his back. A third &s;uffered the animal to lick the blood from his face, without &s;hrinking, or turning away his eyes. During the whole of that horrid &s;pectacle, they never once bewailed them&s;elves, nor were heard to groan.</P>
<P>In concluding from the &s;oregoing facts, that there are different races of men, I reckon upon &s;trenuous oppo&s;ition, not only from men bia&s;&s;ed again&s;t what is new or uncommon, but from num|berle&s;s &s;edate writers, who hold every di&s;tingui&s;h|ing

<P>Among the endle&s;s number of writers who a&s;cribe &s;upreme efficacy to the climate, Vitruvius &s;hall take the lead. The fir&s;t chapter of his &s;ixth book is entirely employed in de&s;cribing the influence of climate on the con&s;titution and temper of the na|tives. The following is the &s;ub&s;tance: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For the &s;un, where he throws out a moderate degree of moi&s;ture, pre&s;erves the body in a temperate &s;tate; but where his rays are more fierce, he drains the body of moi&s;ture. In very cold regions, where the moi&s;ture is not &s;uck'd up by the heat, the body, &s;ucking in the dewy air, ri&s;es to a great &s;ize, and has a deep tone of voice. Nor|thern nations accordingly, from cold and moi|&s;ture, have large bodies, a white &s;kin, red hair, grey eyes, and much blood. Nations, on the contrary, near the equator, are of &s;mall &s;tature, tawny complexion, curled hair, black eyes, &s;len|der legs, and little blood. From want of blood, they are cowardly: but they bear fevers well, their con&s;titution being formed by heat. Nor|thern nations, on the contrary, &s;ink under a fe|ver; but from the abundance of blood, they are bold in war."</Q> In another part of the chapter, he adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"From the thinne&s;s of the air, and en|livening heat, &s;outhern nations are quick in thought, and acute in rea&s;oning. Tho&s;e in the north, on the contrary, which breathe a thick and cold air, are dull and &s;tupid."</Q> And this he illu&s;trates from the ca&s;e of &s;erpents, which in &s;ummer-heat are active and vigorous; but in win|ter, become torpid and immoveable. He then proceeds as follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is then not at all &s;urpri&s;ing,
<PB N="30" REF="42">
that heat &s;hould &s;harpen the under&s;tanding, and cold blunt it. Thus the &s;outhern nations are ready in coun&s;el and acute in thought; but make no figure in war, their courage being exhau&s;ted by the heat of the &s;un. The inhabitants of cold climates, prone to war, ru&s;h on with vehe|mence without the lea&s;t fear; but are &s;low of under&s;tanding."</Q> Then he proceeds to account, upon the &s;ame principle, for the &s;uperiority of the Romans in arms, and for the extent of their em|pire. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For as the planet Jupiter lies between the fervid heat of Mars and the bitter cold of Saturn; &s;o Italy, in the middle of the tem|perate zone, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all that is favourable in either climate.

Courage makes an e&s;&s;ential ingredi|ent in magnanimity and heroi&s;m: are &s;uch elevated vir|tues corporeal merely? is the mind admitted for no &s;hare? This indeed would be a mortifying circum|&s;tance in the human race. But even &s;uppo&s;ing cou|rage to be corporeal merely, it is however far from being proportioned to the quantity of blood: a greater quantity than can be circulated freely and ea&s;ily by the force of the heart and arteries, becomes a di&s;ea&s;e, term|ed a plethora. Bodily courage is chiefly founded on the &s;olids. When by the vigour and ela&s;ticity of the heart and arteries a bri&s;k circulation of blood is produced, a man is in good &s;pirits, lively and bold; a greater quantity of blood, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing courage to a higher pitch, never fails to produce &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, and depre&s;&s;ion of mind.</NOTE>?

<P>The mo&s;t formidable antagoni&s;t remains &s;till on hand, viz. Monte&s;quieu, who is a great champion
<PB N="34" REF="46">
for the climate; ob&s;erving, that in hot climates people are timid like old men, and in cold climates bold like young men. This in effect is to maintain, that the torrid zone is an unfit habitation for men; that they degenerate in it, lo&s;e their natural vi|gour, and even in youth become like old men. That ju&s;tly celebrated author certainly intended not any imputation on Providence; and yet, doth it not look like an imputation, to maintain, that &s;o large a portion of the globe is fit for bea&s;ts only, not for men? He ought to have explained why a certain race of men may not be fitted for a hot climate, as others are for a temperate, or for a cold one. There does not appear any oppo&s;ition between heat and courage, more than between cold and courage: on the contrary, courage &s;eems more connected with heat than with cold. The fierce&s;t and bolde&s;t animals, a lion, for example, a tiger, a panther, thrive no where &s;o much as in the hotte&s;t climates. The great condor of Peru in the torrid zone, is a bird not a little fierce and rapacious. A lion vi&s;ibly degenerates in a temperate climate. The lions of Mount Atlas, which is &s;ometimes crowned with &s;now, have not the boldne&s;s nor the force, nor the ferocity of &s;uch as tread the burning &s;ands of Zaara and Biledulgerid.

The Samoides and Laplanders are living in&s;tances of un|common pu&s;illanimity in the inhabitants of a cold climate; and in&s;tances, not few in number, have been mentioned of warlike people in a hot climate. To the&s;e I add the Hindows, whom our author will not admit to have any degree of courage; tho' he acknowledges, that, prompted by religion, the men voluntarily &s;ubmit to dreadful tortures,
<PB N="35" REF="47">
and that even women are ambitious to burn them|&s;elves alive with their decea&s;ed hu&s;bands. In vain does he endeavour to account for &s;uch extraordina|ry exertions of fortitude, active as well as pa&s;&s;ive, by the force of imagination; as if imagination could operate more forcibly in a woman to burn her&s;elf alive, than on a man to meet his enemy in battle. The Malayans and Scandinavians live in very oppo&s;ite climates, and yet are equally coura|geous. Providence has placed the&s;e nations each of them in its proper climate: cold would benumb a Malayan in Sweden, heat would enervate a Swede in Malacca; and both would be rendered cowards. I &s;top here; for to enter the li&s;ts again&s;t an anta|goni&s;t of &s;o great fame, gives me a &s;eeling as if I were treading on forbidden ground.</P>
<P>The colour of the Negroes, as above ob&s;erved, affords a &s;trong pre&s;umption of their being a diffe|rent race from the Whites; and I once thought, that the pre&s;umption was &s;upported by inferiority in their under&s;tanding. But it appears to me doubt|ful, upon &s;econd thoughts, whether the inferiority of their under&s;tanding may not be occa&s;ioned by their condition. A man never ripens in judgement nor in prudence but by exerci&s;ing the&s;e powers. At home the negroes have little occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e either of them: they live upon fruits and roots, which grow without culture they need little cloath|ing: and they erect hou&s;es without trouble or art. Abroad, they are mi&s;erable &s;laves, having no en|couragement either to think or to act. Who can &s;ay how far they might improve in a &s;tate of free|dom, were they obliged, like Europeans, to pro|cure bread with the &s;weat of their brows? Some kingdoms in Negroland, particularly that of Whi|dah, have made great improvements in govern|ment, in police, and in manners. The negroes, particularly on the gold-coa&s;t, are naturally gay:
<PB N="36" REF="48">
they are indu&s;trious, apprehend readily what is &s;aid to them, have a good judgement, are equi|table in their dealings, and accommodate them&s;elves readily to the manners of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e the &s;urvey with &s;ome in&s;tances that &s;eem to differ widely from the common nature of man. The Giagas, a fierce and wandering nation in the heart of Africa, are in effect land-pirates, at war with all the world. They indulge in poly|gamy; but bury all their children the moment of birth, and chu&s;e in their &s;tead the mo&s;t promi&s;ing children taken in war. There is no principle among animals more prevalent than affection to their offspring: &s;uppo&s;ing the Giagas to be born without hands or without feet, would they be more di&s;tingui&s;hable from the re&s;t of mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have oftener than once doubted, whether the authors de&s;erve credit from whom this account is taken; and, after all, I do not pre&s;s it upon my readers. There is only one con&s;ideration that can bring it within the verge of probability, viz the little affection that male &s;avages have for their new-born children, which ap|pears from the ancient practice of expo&s;ing them. The affection of the mother commences with the birth of the child; and had &s;he a vote, no infant would ever be de&s;troyed. But as the affection of the father begins much later, the practice of de&s;troying new-born infants may be thought not altogether incredible in a wandering nation who live by rapine, and who can provide them|&s;elves with children more ea&s;ily than by the tedious and precarious method of rearing them.</NOTE>? The author of an account of Guiana, mentioning a deadly poi&s;on compo&s;ed by the natives, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I do not find that even in their wars they ever u&s;e poi&s;oned arrows. And yet it may be won|dered, that a people living under no laws, actu|ated with no religious principle, and unre&s;train|ed by the fear of pre&s;ent or future puni&s;hment,

&s;hould not &s;ometimes employ that fatal poi&s;on for gratifying hatred, jealou&s;y, or revenge. But in a &s;tate of nature, tho' there are few re&s;traints, there are al&s;o fewer temptations to vice; and the dif|ferent tribes are doubtle&s;s &s;en&s;ible that poi&s;oned arrows in war would, upon the whole, do more mi&s;chief than good."</Q> This writer it would &s;eem has forgot, that pro&s;pects of future good or evil never have influence upon &s;avages. Is it his opi|nion, that fear of future mi&s;chiefs to them&s;elves, would make the negroes of New Guinea ab&s;tain from employing poi&s;oned arrows again&s;t their ene|mies? We have nothing but original di&s;po&s;ition to account for manners &s;o &s;ingular in the &s;avages of Guiana. The Japane&s;e re&s;ent injuries in a manner which has not a parallel in any other part of the world: it is indeed &s;o &s;ingular as &s;carce to be con&s;i&s;tent with human nature. Others wreak their re&s;entment on the per&s;on who affronts them; but an inhabitant of Japan wreaks it on him&s;elf: he rips up his own belly. Kempfer re|ports the following in&s;tance. A gentleman coming down the great &s;tair of the Emperor's palace, pa&s;|&s;ed another going up, and their &s;words happened to cla&s;h. The per&s;on de&s;cending took offence: the other excu&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;aying that it was acci|dental: adding, that &s;words only were concerned, and that his was as good as the other. I'll &s;how you the difference, &s;ays the per&s;on who began the quarrel: he drew his &s;word, and ripped up his own belly. The other, piqued at being thus prevented in revenge, ha&s;tened up with a plate he had in his hand for the Emperor's table; and returning with equal &s;peed, he in like manner ripped up his belly in &s;ight of his antagoni&s;t, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If I had not been &s;erving my prince, you &s;hould not have got the &s;tart of me; but I &s;hall die &s;atisfied, hav|ing &s;how'd you that my &s;word is as good as

yours."</Q> The &s;ame author gives an in&s;tance of uncommon ferocity in the Japane&s;e, blended with manners highly poli&s;hed. In the mid&s;t of a large company at dinner, a young woman, &s;train|ing to reach a plate, unwarily &s;uffered wind to e&s;cape. A&s;hamed and confounded, &s;he rai&s;ed her brea&s;ts to her mouth, tore them with her teeth, and expired on the &s;pot. The Japane&s;e are equally &s;ingular in &s;ome of their religious opinions. They never &s;upplicate the gods in di&s;tre&s;s; holding, that as the gods enjoy uninterrupted bli&s;s, &s;uch &s;uppli|cations would be offen&s;ive to them. Their holi|days accordingly are dedicated to fea&s;ts, weddings, and all public and private rejoicings. It is delight|ful to the gods, &s;ay they, to &s;ee men happy. They are far from being &s;ingular in thinking that a benevolent deity is plea&s;ed to &s;ee men happy; but nothing can be more incon&s;i&s;tent with the common feelings of men, than to hold, that in di&s;tre&s;s it is wrong to &s;upplicate the author of our nature for relief, and that he will be di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;uch &s;up|plication. In deep affliction, there is certainly no balm equal to that of pouring out the heart to a benevolent deity, and expre&s;&s;ing entire re&s;ignation to his will.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the foregoing doctrine, many particu|lars &s;till more extraordinary might have been quoted from Greek and Roman writers: but truth has no occa&s;ion for artifice; and I would not take advan|tage of celebrated names to vouch facts that appear incredible or uncertain. The Greeks and Romans made an illu&s;trious figure in poetry, rhetoric, and all the fine arts; but they were little better than novices in natural hi&s;tory. More than half of the globe was to them what the Terra Au&s;tralis incog|nita is to us; and imagination operates without control when it is not checked by knowledge: the ignorant at the &s;ame time are delighted with won|ders;
<PB N="39" REF="51">
and the more wonderful a &s;tory is, the more welcome it is made. This may &s;erve as an apolo|gy for ancient writers, even when they relate and believe facts to us incredible. Men at that period were ignorant, in a great mea&s;ure, of nature, and of the limits of her operations. One conce&s;&s;ion will be made to me, that the writers mentioned who report things at &s;econd-hand, are much more excu&s;able than the earlie&s;t of our modern tra|vellers, who pretend to vouch endle&s;s wonders from their own knowledge. Natural hi&s;tory, that of man e&s;pecially, is of late years much ripened: no improbable tale is &s;uffered to pa&s;s without a &s;trict examination; and I have been careful to adopt no facts but what are vouched by late travel|lers and writers of credit. Were it true what Dio|dorus Siculus reports on the authority of Aga|tharchides of Cnidus, concerning the lchthyopha|ges on the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Afric, it would be a more pregnant proof of a di&s;tinct race of men than any I have di&s;covered. They are de&s;cribed to be &s;o &s;tupid, that even when their wives and children are killed in their &s;ight, they &s;tand in&s;en&s;ible, and give no &s;igns either of anger or of compa&s;&s;ion. This I cannot believe upon &s;o &s;light te&s;timony; and the Greeks and Romans were at that time extremely credulous, being le&s;s acquainted with neighbouring nations, than we are with the Anti|podes. The Balearic i&s;lands, Majorca, Minorca, Yvica, are at no great di&s;tance from Sicily; and yet Diodorus the Sicilian reports of the inhabi|tants, that at the &s;olemnization of marriage all the male friends, and even the hou&s;ehold &s;ervants, lay with the bride before the bridegroom was admitted. Credat Judeus appella. It would not be much more difficult to make me believe what is &s;aid by Pliny of the Blemmyans, that they had no head, and that the mouth and eyes were in the
<PB N="40" REF="52">
brea&s;t; or of the Arima&s;pi, who had but one eye, placed in the middle of the forehead; or of the A&s;tomi, who having no mouth, could neither eat nor drink, but lived upon &s;melling; or of a thou|&s;and other ab&s;urdities which Pliny relates, with a grave face, in the 6th book of his natural hi&s;tory, cap. 30. and in the 7th book, cap. 2.</P>
<P>Thus upon an exten&s;ive &s;urvey of the inhabited parts of our globe, many nations are found diffe|ring &s;o widely from each other, not only in com|plexion, in features, in &s;hape, and in other exter|nal circum&s;tances, but in temper and di&s;po&s;ition, particularly in two capital articles, courage and the treatment of &s;trangers, that even the certain|ty of there being different races could not make one expect more &s;triking differences. Doth M. Buffon think it &s;ufficient, barely to &s;ay, that &s;uch differences may po&s;&s;ibly be the effect of climate, or of other accidental cau&s;es? The pre&s;umption is, that the differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at pre&s;ent have always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; which ought to be held as true, till po|&s;itive evidence be brought of the contrary: in&s;tead of which we are put off with bare &s;uppo&s;itions and po&s;&s;ibilities.</P>
<P>But not to re&s;t entirely upon pre&s;umptive evi|dence, to me it appears clear from the very frame of the human body, that there mu&s;t be different races of men fitted for different climates. Few animals are more affected than men generally are, not only with change of &s;ea&s;ons in the &s;ame cli|mate, but with change of weather in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on. Can &s;uch a being be fitted for all cli|mates equally? Impo&s;&s;ible. A man mu&s;t at lea&s;t be hardened by nature again&s;t the &s;lighter changes of &s;ea&s;ons or weather: he ought to be altogether in&s;en&s;ible of &s;uch changes. Yet from Sir John Pringle's ob&s;ervations on the di&s;ea&s;es of the army, to go no further, it appears, that even military
<PB N="41" REF="53">
men, who ought of all to be the hardie&s;t, are greatly affected by them. Hor&s;es and horned cattle &s;leep on the bare ground, wet or dry, without harm; and yet are not made for every climate: can a man be made for every climate, who is &s;o much more delicate, that he cannot &s;leep on wet ground without hazard of &s;ome mortal di&s;ea&s;e?</P>
<P>But the argument I chiefly rely on is, That were all men of one &s;pecies, there never could have exi&s;ted, without a miracle, different kinds, &s;uch as exi&s;t at pre&s;ent. Giving allowance for every &s;up|po&s;eable variation of climate, or of other natural cau&s;es, what can follow, as ob&s;erved about the dog|kind, but endle&s;s varieties among individuals, as among tulips in a garden, &s;o as that no individual &s;hall re&s;emble another. In&s;tead of which we find men of different kinds, the individuals of each kind remarkably uniform, and differing not le&s;s remark|ably from the individuals of every other kind. Uniformity and permanency are the offspring of de&s;ign, never of chance.</P>
<P>There is another argument that appears al&s;o to have weight: Hor&s;es with re&s;pect to &s;ize, &s;hape, and &s;pirit, differ widely in different climates. But let a male and a female, of whatever climate, be carried into a country where hor&s;es are in perfec|tion, their progeny will improve gradually, and will acquire in time the perfection of their kind. Is not this a proof, that all hor&s;es are of one kind? If &s;o, men are not all of one kind; for if a White mix with a Black in whatever climate, or a Hot|tentot with a Samoide, the re&s;ult will not be either an improvement of the kind, or the contrary; but a mongrel breed differing from both parents. It is thus a&s;certained beyond any rational doubt, that there are different races or kinds of men, and that the&s;e races or kinds are naturally fitted for different climates: whence we have rea&s;on to con|clude,
<PB N="42" REF="54">
that originally each kind was placed in its proper climate, whatever change may have hap|pened in later times by war or commerce.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable fact that confirms the foregoing conjectures. As far back as hi&s;tory goes, or tradition kept alive by hi&s;tory, the earth was inhabited by &s;avages divided into many &s;mall tribes, each tribe having a language peculiar to it&s;elf. Is it not natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e original tribes were different races of men, placed in proper cli|mates, and left to form their own language?</P>
<P>Upon &s;umming up the whole particulars men|tioned above, would one he&s;itate a moment to adopt the following opinion, were there no counter|balancing evidence, viz. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That God created many pairs of the human race, differing from each other both externally and internally; that he fitted the&s;e pairs for different climates, and placed each pair in its proper climate; that the peculiarities of the original pairs were pre&s;erved entire in their de&s;cendents; who, having no a&s;&s;i&s;tance but their natural talents, were left to gather knowledge from experience, and in particular were left (each tribe) to form a lan|guage for it&s;elf; that &s;igns were &s;ufficient for the original pairs, without any language but what nature &s;ugge&s;ts; and that a language was formed gradually, as a tribe increa&s;ed in num|bers, and in different occupations, to make &s;peech nece&s;&s;ary?"</Q> But this opinion, however plau&s;ible, we are not permitted to adopt; being taught a different le&s;&s;on by revelation, viz. That God created but a &s;ingle pair of the human &s;pecies. Tho' we cannot doubt of the authority of Mo&s;es, yet his account of the creation of man is not a little puzzling, as it &s;eems to contradict every one of the facts mentioned above. According to that account, different races of men were not formed, nor were
<PB N="43" REF="55">
men formed originally for different climates. All men mu&s;t have &s;poken the &s;ame language, viz. that of our fir&s;t parents. And what of all &s;eems the mo&s;t contradictory to that account, is the &s;avage &s;tate: Adam, as Mo&s;es informs us, was endued by his Maker with an eminent degree of knowledge; and he certainly was an excellent preceptor to his children and their progeny, among whom he lived many generations. Whence then the degeneracy of all men unto the &s;avage &s;tate? To account for that di&s;mal cata&s;trophe, mankind mu&s;t have &s;uffer|ed &s;ome terrible convul&s;ion.</P>
<P>That terrible convul&s;ion is revealed to us in the hi&s;tory of the tower of Babel, contained in the 11th chapter of Gene&s;is, which is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That for many centuries after the deluge, the whole earth was of one language, and of one &s;peech; that they united to build a city on a plain in the land of Shinar, with a tower who&s;e top might reach unto heaven; that the Lord beholding the people to be one, and to have all one lan|guage, and that nothing would be re&s;trained from them which they imagined to do, con|founded their language, that they might not under&s;tand one another; and &s;cattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth."</Q> Here light breaks forth in the mid&s;t of darkne&s;s. By confounding the language of men, and &s;cattering them abroad upon the face of all the earth, they were rendered &s;avages. And to harden them for their new habitations, it was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be divided into different kinds, fitted for different climates. Without an immediate change of con&s;titution, the builders of Babel could not po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the burning region of Guinea, nor in the frozen region of Lapland; hou&s;es not being prepared, nor any other conve|nience to protect them again&s;t a de&s;tructive climate.
<PB N="44" REF="56">
Again&s;t this hi&s;tory it has indeed been urged, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the circum&s;tances mentioned evince it to be purely an allegory; that men never were &s;o frantic as to think of building a tower who&s;e top might reach to heaven; and that it is gro&s;sly ab&s;urd, taking the matter literally, that the Almighty was afraid of men, and reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aving him&s;elf by a miracle."</Q> But that this is a real hi&s;tory, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be admitted, as the confu&s;ion of Babel is the only known fact that can reconcile &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>And this leads us to con&s;ider the diver&s;ity of languages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the &s;ocial &s;tate is e&s;&s;ential to man, and &s;peech to the &s;ocial &s;tate, the wi&s;dom of Providence in &s;itting men for acquiring that nece&s;&s;ary art, de&s;erves more at|tention than is commonly be&s;towed on it. The Orang Outang has the external organs of &s;peech in perfection; and many are puzzled to account why it never &s;peaks. But the external organs of &s;peech make but a &s;mall part of the nece&s;&s;ary apparatus. The faculty of imitating &s;ounds is an e&s;&s;ential part; and wonderful would that faculty appear, were it not rendered familiar by practice: a child of two or three years, is able, by nature alone, without the lea&s;t in&s;truction, to adapt its organs of &s;peech to every articulate &s;ound; and a child of four or five years can pitch its windpipe &s;o as to emit a &s;ound of any elevation, which enables it with an ear to imitate the &s;ongs it hears. But above all the other parts, &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding are e&s;&s;ential to &s;peech. A parrot can pronounce articulate &s;ounds, and it has frequently an inclination to &s;peak; but, for want of under&s;tanding, none of the kind can form a &s;ingle &s;en|tence. Has an Orang Outang under&s;tanding to form a mental propo&s;ition? has he a faculty to expre&s;s that propo&s;ition in &s;ounds? and &s;uppo&s;ing him able to ex|pre&s;s what he &s;ees and hears, what would he make of the connective and disjunctive particles?</NOTE>. If the common language of men had
<PB N="45" REF="57">
not been confounded upon their attempting the tower of Babel, I affirm, that there never could have been but one language. Antiquaries con|&s;tantly &s;uppo&s;e a migrating &s;pirit in the original inhabitants of this earth; not only without evi|dence, but contrary to all probability. Men never de&s;ert their connections nor their country without nece&s;&s;ity: fear of enemies and of wild bea&s;ts, as well as the attraction of &s;ociety, are more than &s;ufficient to re&s;train them from wandering; not to mention that &s;avages are peculiarly fond of their natal &s;oil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>With re&s;pect to the &s;uppo&s;ed migrating &s;pirit, even Bochart mu&s;t yield to Kemp&s;er in boldne&s;s of conjec|ture.

Nay, he traces mo&s;t minutely their road to Japan; and concludes, that they mu&s;t have travelled with great expedition, becau&s;e their language has no tincture of any other. He did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to explain, what temptation they had to wander &s;o far from home; nor why they &s;ettled in an i&s;land, not pre|ferable either in &s;oil or climate to many countries they mu&s;t have traver&s;ed.</P>
<P>An ingenious French writer ob&s;erves, that plau&s;ible rea&s;ons would lead one to conjecture, that men were more early poli&s;hed in i&s;lands than in continents; as people, crowded together, &s;oon find the nece&s;&s;ity of laws to re&s;train them from mi&s;chief. And yet, &s;ays he, the manners of i&s;landers and their laws are commonly the late&s;t formed. A very &s;imple reflection would have unfolded the my&s;tery. Many many centuries did n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters"> exi&s;t without thinking of navigation. That art was not invented till men, &s;traitened in their quarters upon the continent, thought of occupying adjacent i&s;lands.</P></NOTE>. The fir&s;t migrations were probably occa&s;ioned by factions and civil wars; the next by commerce. Greece affords in&s;tances of the former,
<PB N="46" REF="58">
Phoenicia of the latter. Unle&s;s upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, members of a family or of a tribe will never retire farther from their fellows than is nece&s;&s;ary for food; and by retiring gradually, they lo&s;e neither their connections nor their manners, far le&s;s their language, which is in con&s;tant exerci&s;e. As far back as hi&s;tory carries us, tribes without number are di&s;covered, each having a language peculiar to it&s;elf. Strabo<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 2.</NOTE> reports, that the Albanians were divided into &s;everal tribes, differing in external appearance and in language. Cae&s;ar found in Gaul &s;everal &s;uch tribes; and Tacitus records the names of many tribes in Germany. There are a multi|tude of American tribes that to this day continue di&s;tinct from each other, and have each a different language. The mother-tongues at pre&s;ent, tho' numerous, bear no proportion to what formerly exi&s;ted. We find original tribes gradually enlarg|ing; by conque&s;t frequently, and more frequently by the union of weak tribes for mutual defence. Such events promote one language in&s;tead of many. The Celtic tongue, once exten&s;ive, is at pre&s;ent confined to the highlands of Scotland, to Wales, to Britany, and to a part of Ireland. In a few centuries, it will &s;hare the fate of many other original tongues: it will be totally forgotten.</P>
<P>If men had not been &s;cattered every where upon the con&s;u&s;ion of Babel, another particular mu&s;t have occurred, differing not le&s;s from what has really happened than that now mentioned. As paradi&s;e is conjectured to have been &s;ituated in the heart of A&s;ia, the &s;urrounding regions, for the rea&s;on above given, mu&s;t have been fir&s;t peopled; and the civilization and improvements of the mo|ther-country were undoubtedly carried along to every new &s;ettlement. In particular, the colonies
<PB N="47" REF="59">
planted in America, the South-&s;ea i&s;lands, and the Terra Au&s;tralis incognita, mu&s;t have been highly poli&s;hed; becau&s;e, being at the greate&s;t di&s;tance, they probably were the late&s;t. And yet the&s;e and other remote people, the Mexicans and Peruvians excepted, remain to this day in the original &s;avage &s;tate of hunting and fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>Thus, had not men wildly attempted to build a tower who&s;e top might reach to heaven, all men would not only have &s;poken the &s;ame language, but would have made the &s;ame progre&s;s toward maturity of knowledge and civilization. That de|plorable event rever&s;ed all nature: by &s;cattering men over the face of all the earth, it deprived them of &s;ociety, and rendered them &s;avages. From that &s;tate of degeneracy, they have been emerging gradually. Some nations, &s;timulated by their own nature, or by their climate, have made a rapid progre&s;s; &s;ome have proceeded more &s;lowly; and &s;ome continue &s;avages.

<HEAD>Progre&s;s of Men with re&s;pect to FOOD and PO|PULATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN temperate climates, the original food of men was fruits that grow without culture, and the fle&s;h of land-animals. As &s;uch animals become &s;hy when often hunted, there is a contrivance of nature, no le&s;s &s;imple than effectual, which engages men to bear with chearfulne&s;s the fatigues of hunting, and the uncertainty of capture; and that is, an appetite for hunting. Hunger alone is not &s;uffi|cient: &s;avages, who act by &s;en&s;e not by fore&s;ight, move not when the &s;tomach is full; and it would be too late when the &s;tomach is empty, to form a hunting-party. As this appetite belongs to every &s;avage who depends on hunting for procuring food; it is one in&s;tance, among many, of providential wi&s;dom, in adapting the internal con&s;titution of man to his external circum&s;tances. The appetite for hunting, tho' among us little nece&s;&s;ary for food, is, to this day, vi&s;ible in our young men, high and low, rich and poor. Natural propen&s;ities may be rendered faint or ob&s;cure, but never are totally eradicated.</P>
<P>It is probable, that fi&s;h was not early the food of man. Water is not our element; and &s;avages probably did not attempt to draw any food from the &s;ea or from rivers, till land-animals turned &s;carce. Plutarch in his Sympo&s;iacs ob&s;erves, that the Syrians and Greeks of old ab&s;tained from fi&s;h. Menelaus<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 4. of the Ody&s;&s;ey.</NOTE> complains, that his companions had been reduced by hunger to that food; and tho' the
<PB N="49" REF="61">
Grecian camp, at the &s;iege of Troy, was on the &s;ea-&s;hore, there is not in Homer a &s;ingle hint of their &s;eeding on fi&s;h. We learn from Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, that the Caledonians did not eat fi&s;h, tho' they had them in plenty; which is confirmed by Adamannus, a Scotch hi&s;torian, in his life of St. Columba. The ancient Caledonians depended almo&s;t entirely on deer for food, becau&s;e in a cold country the fruits that grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly afford very little nouri&s;h|ment; and dome&s;tic animals, which at pre&s;ent &s;o much abound, were not early known in the north of Britain.</P>
<P>Antiquaries talk of acorns, nuts, and other &s;hell|fruits, as the only vegetable food that men had originally; overlooking wheat, rice, barley, &amp;c. which mu&s;t, from the creation, have grown &s;pon|taneou&s;ly: for &s;urely, when agriculture fir&s;t com|menced, &s;eeds of the&s;e plants were not procured by a miracle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Writers upon natural hi&s;tory have been &s;olicitous to di&s;cover the original climate of the&s;e plants; but without much &s;ucce&s;s. The original climate of plants left to nature, cannot be a &s;ecret: but in countries well peopled, the plants mentioned are not left to nature; the &s;eeds are carefully gathered, and &s;tored up for food. As this practice could not fail to make the&s;e &s;eeds &s;carce, agriculture was early thought of, which, by introducing plants into new &s;oils and new climates, has rendered the original climate ob&s;cure. If we can trace that climate, it mu&s;t be in regions de&s;titute of inhabitants, or but thinly peopled. The Sioux, a very &s;mall tribe in North-America, po&s;&s;e&s;s a va&s;t country, where oats grow &s;pon|taneou&s;ly in meadows and on the &s;ides of rivers, which make part of their food, without nece&s;&s;ity of agriculture. While the French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Port Dauphin in the i&s;land of Madaga&s;car, they rai&s;ed excellent wheat. That &s;ta|tion was de&s;erted many years ago; and to this day grows naturally among the gra&s;s in great vigour. In the country about Mount Tabor in Pale&s;tine, barley and oats grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly. In the kingdom of Siam, there are many &s;pots where rice grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly, year after year, without any culture. Diodorus Siculus is our authority for &s;aying, that in the territory of Leon|tinum, and in other parts of Sicily, wheat grew wild without any culture. And it does &s;o to this day about Mount Etna.</NOTE>. The Laplanders, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a country
<PB N="50" REF="62">
where corn will not grow, make bread of the inner bark of trees; and Linneus reports, that &s;wine there fatten on that food, as well as in Sweden upon corn.</P>
<P>Plenty of food procured by hunting and fi&s;hing, promotes population: but as con&s;umption of food increa&s;es with population, wild animals, &s;orely per|&s;ecuted, become not only more rare but more &s;hy. Men, thus pinched for food, are excited to try other means for &s;upplying their wants. A fawn, a kid, or a lamb, taken alive, and tamed for amu&s;e|ment, &s;ugge&s;ted probably flocks and herds, and in|troduced the &s;hepherd-&s;tate. Changes are not perfected but by &s;low degrees: hunting and fi&s;hing continue for a long time favourite occupations; and the few animals that are dome&s;ticated, &s;erve as a common &s;tock to be di&s;tributed among individuals, according to their wants. But as the idle and indo|lent, tho' the lea&s;t de&s;erving, are thus the greate&s;t con&s;umers of the common &s;tock, an improvement was &s;ugge&s;ted, that every family &s;hould rear a &s;tock for them&s;elves. Men by that politic regulation be|ing taught to rely on their own indu&s;try, di&s;play'd the hoarding-principle, which multiplied flocks and herds exceedingly. And thus the &s;hepherd-&s;tate was perfected, plenty of food being &s;upplied at home, without ranging the woods or the waters. Hunting and fi&s;hing being no longer nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="51" REF="63">
food, became an amu&s;ement merely, and a gratifi|cation of the original appetite for hunting.</P>
<P>The finger of God may be clearly traced in the provi&s;ion made of animal food for man. Grameni|vorous animals, perhaps all, make palatable and whole&s;ome food. I except not the hor&s;e: &s;ome nations feed on it; others do not, becau&s;e it is more profitable by its labour. Carnivorous animals, ge|nerally &s;peaking, make not whole&s;ome food nor palatable. The fir&s;t-mentioned animals are gentle, and ea&s;ily dome&s;ticated: the latter are fierce, not ea&s;ily tamed, and uncertain in temper when tamed. Gra&s;s grows every where in temperate regions; and men be&s;ide can multiply animal food without end, by training dome&s;tic animals to live on turnip, car|rot, potato, and other roots, &amp;c. Herodotus adds the following admirable reflection: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We may ra|tionally conjecture, that Divine Providence has rendered extremely prolific &s;uch creatures as are naturally fearful, and &s;erve for food; le&s;t they &s;hould be de&s;troyed by con&s;tant con&s;umption: whereas the rapacious and cruel are almo&s;t bar|ren. The hare, which is the prey of bea&s;ts, birds, and men, is a great breeder: a lione&s;s, on the contrary, the &s;tronge&s;t and fierce&s;t of bea&s;ts, brings forth but once."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;hepherd-&s;tate is friendly to population. Men by plenty of food multiply apace; and in proce&s;s of time neighbouring tribes, &s;traitened in their pa&s;ture, go to war for exten&s;ion of territory, or migrate to grounds not yet occupied. Nece&s;&s;ity, the mother of invention, &s;ugge&s;ted agriculture. When corn growing &s;pontaneou&s;ly was rendered &s;carce by con|&s;umption, it was an obvious thought to propagate it by art: nature was the guide, which carries on its work of propagation with &s;eeds, that drop from plants in their maturity, and &s;pring up new plants. As the land was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common, the &s;eed of
<PB N="52" REF="64">
cour&s;e was &s;own in common, and &s;tored in a com|mon repo&s;itory to be parcelled out among individu|als in want, as the common &s;tock of animals had been formerly. We have for our authority Diodo|rus Siculus, that the Celtiberians divided their land annually among individuals, to be laboured for the u&s;e of the public, and that the product was &s;tored up, and di&s;tributed from time to time among the nece&s;&s;itous. A la&s;ting divi&s;ion of the land among the members of the &s;tate, &s;ecuring to each man the product of his own &s;kill and labour, was a great &s;pur to indu&s;try, and multiplied food exceedingly. Popu|lation made a rapid progre&s;s, and government be|came an art: for agriculture and commerce cannot flouri&s;h without &s;alutary laws.</P>
<P>Natural fruits ripen to greater perfection in a temperate than in a cold climate, and cultivation is more ea&s;y; which circum&s;tances make it highly probable, that agriculture became fir&s;t an art in temperate climes. The culture of corn was &s;o early known in Greece, as to make a branch of its fabu|lous hi&s;tory: in Egypt it mu&s;t have been coeval with the inhabitants; for while the Nile overflows, they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without corn<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract. 1.</NOTE>. Nor without corn could the ancient monarchies of A&s;&s;yria and Babylon have been &s;o populous and powerful as they are &s;aid to have been. In the northern parts of Europe, wheat, barley, pea&s;e, and perhaps oats, are foreign plants: as the climate is not friendly to corn, agriculture mu&s;t have crept northward by &s;low degrees; and even at pre&s;ent, it requires no &s;mall portion both of &s;kill and indu&s;try to bring corn to maturity in &s;uch a climate. Hence it may be inferred with certainty, that the &s;hepherd-&s;tate continued longer in northern climates than in tho&s;e nearer the &s;un. Cold countries however are friend|ly

to population; and the northern people, multi|plying beyond the food that can be &s;upplied by flocks and herds, were compelled to throw off many &s;warms in &s;earch of new habitations. Their fre|quent migrations were for many years a dreadful &s;courge to neighbouring kingdoms. People, amaz|ed at the multitude of the invaders, judged, that the countries from whence they i&s;&s;ued mu&s;t have been exceedingly populous; and hence the North was termed officina gentium; but &s;carcity of food in the &s;hepherd-&s;tate was the true cau&s;e.

<P>The progre&s;s here delineated has, in all temper|ate climates of the old world, been preci&s;ely uni|form; but it has been different in the extremes of cold and hot climates. In very cold regions, which produce little vegetable food for man, the hunter|&s;tate was originally e&s;&s;ential. In temperate regions, as ob&s;erved above, men &s;ub&s;i&s;ted partly on vegeta|ble food, which is more and more plentiful in pro|portion to the heat of the climate. In the torrid
<PB N="56" REF="68">
zone, natural fruits are produced in &s;uch plenty and perfection, as to be more than &s;ufficient for a mo|derate population: and in ca&s;e of extraordinary po|pulation, the tran&s;ition to hu&s;bandry is ea&s;y. There are found accordingly in every populous country of the torrid zone, crops of rice, maize, roots, and other vegetable food, rai&s;ed by the hand of man. As hunting becomes thus le&s;s and le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in the progre&s;s from cold to hot countries, the appe|tite for hunting keeps pace with that progre&s;s; it is vigorous in very cold countries, where men depend on hunting for food; it is le&s;s vigorous in temperate countries, where they are partly fed with natural fruits; and there is &s;carce any ve&s;tige of it in hot countries, where vegetables are the food of men, and where meat is an article of luxury. The ori|ginal occupation of &s;avages, both in cold and tem|perate climates, is hunting, altogether e&s;&s;ential in the former as the only means of procuring food. The next &s;tep of the progre&s;s in both, is the occu|pation of a &s;hepherd; and there the progre&s;s &s;tops &s;hort in very cold regions, unfit for corn. Lapland in particular produces no vegetable but mo&s;s, which is the food of no animal but of the rain-deer. This circum&s;tance &s;olely is what renders Lapland habita|ble by men. Without rain-deer, the &s;ea-coa&s;ts within the reach of fi&s;h would admit &s;ome inhabit|ants; but the inland parts would be a de&s;ert. As the &s;wiftne&s;s of that animal makes it not an ea&s;y prey, the taming it for food mu&s;t have been early attempted; and its natural docility made the at|tempt &s;ucceed. It yields to no other animal in u&s;e|fulne&s;s: it is equal to a hor&s;e for draught: its fle&s;h is excellent food; and the female gives milk more nouri&s;hing than that of a cow: its fur is fine; and the leather made of its &s;kin, is both &s;oft and durable. In Tartary, tho' a great part of it lies in a temper|atezone, there is little corn. As far back as tradi|tion
<PB N="57" REF="69">
reaches, the Tartars have had flocks and herds; and yet, in a great mea&s;ure, they not only continue hunters, but retain the ferocity of that &s;tate: they are not fond of being &s;hepherds, and have not any knowledge of hu&s;bandry. This in appearance is &s;ingular; but nothing happens without a cau&s;e. Tartary is one continued mountain from we&s;t to ea&s;t, ri&s;ing high above the countries to the &s;outh; and declining gradually to the northern ocean, with|out a &s;ingle hill to intercept the bitter bla&s;ts of the north. A few &s;pots excepted, a tree above the &s;ize of a &s;hrub cannot live in it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May not a &s;imilar &s;ituation in &s;ome parts of North America, be partly the occa&s;ion of the cold that is felt there, beyond what Europe &s;eels in the &s;ame lati|tude?</NOTE>.

Great Tartary abounds with pa&s;ture; but extreme cold renders it very little capable of corn. Thro' all Chine&s;e Tartary, even as low as the 43d degree of latitude, the fro&s;t continues &s;even or eight months every year; and that country, tho' in the latitude of France, is as cold as Iceland; the cau&s;es of which are its nitrous &s;oil, and its height without any &s;helter from the we&s;t wind that has pa&s;&s;ed through an immen&s;e continent extremely cold. A certain place near the &s;ource of the river Kavamhuran, and within 80 leagues of the great wall, was found by Father Verbei&s;t to be 3000 geo|metrical paces above the level of the &s;ea. Thus the Tartars, like the Laplanders, are chained to the &s;hepherd-&s;tate, and can never advance to be hu&s;band|men.
<PB N="58" REF="70">
If population among them ever be &s;o great as to require more food than the &s;hepherd-&s;tate can &s;upply, migration will be their only re&s;ource.</P>
<P>In every &s;tep of the progre&s;s, the torrid zone differs. We have no evidence that either the hunter or &s;hepherd &s;tate were ever known there: the inhabitants at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon vegetable food; and probably did &s;o from the beginning. In Manila, one of the Philippine i&s;lands, the trees bud, blo&s;&s;om, and bear fruit, all the year round. The natives, driven from the &s;ea-coa&s;t to the inland parts, have no particular place of abode, but live under the &s;helter of trees, which afford them food as well as habitation; and when the fruit is con|&s;umed in one &s;pot, they remove to another. The orange, lemon, and other European trees, bear fruit twice a-year: a &s;prig planted bears fruit with|in the year. And this picture of Manila an&s;wers to numberle&s;s places in the torrid zone. The Ma|rian or Ladrone i&s;lands are extremely populous; and yet the inhabitants live entirely on fi&s;h, fruits, and roots. The inhabitants of the new Philippine i&s;lands live on cocoa-nuts, &s;alads, roots, and fi&s;h. The inland negroes make but one meal a-day, which is in the evening. Their diet is plain, con|&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly of rice, fruits, and roots. The i&s;|land of Otaheite is healthy, the people tall and well made; and by temperance, vegetables and fi&s;h being their chief nouri&s;hment, they live to a good old age, with &s;carce any ailment. There is no &s;uch thing known among them as rotten teeth: the very &s;mell of wine or &s;pirits is di&s;agreeable; and they never deal in tobacco nor &s;piceries. In many places Indian corn is the chief nouri&s;hment, which every man plants for him&s;elf. The inhabitants of Biledulgerid and the de&s;ert of Zaara have but two meals a-day, one in the morning, and one in the evening. Being temperate, and &s;trangers to the
<PB N="59" REF="71">
di&s;ea&s;es of luxury and idlene&s;s, they generally live to a great age. Sixty with them is the prime of life, as thirty is in Europe. An inhabitant of Madaga&s;car will travel two or three days without any food but a &s;ugar cane. There is indeed little appetite for animal food in hot climates; tho' beef and fowl have in &s;mall quantities been introduced to the tables of the great, as articles of luxury. In America are ob&s;ervable &s;ome variations from the progre&s;s; but the&s;e are re&s;erved for a &s;eparate &s;ketch<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Book 2. &s;ketch 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to population in particular, that plenty of food is its chief cau&s;e, may be illu&s;trated by the following calculation. The &s;outhern pro|vinces of China produce two crops of rice in a year, &s;ometimes three; and an acre well cultivated gives food to ten mouths. The pea&s;ants go almo&s;t naked; and the better &s;ort wear but a &s;ingle garment made of cotton, of which as much is produced upon an acre as may cloath four or five hundred per&s;ons. Hence the extreme populou&s;ne&s;s of China and other rice countries. The Ca&s;&s;ave root, which &s;erves the Americans for bread, is produced in &s;uch plenty, that an acre of it will feed more per&s;ons than &s;ix acres of wheat. It is not then for want of food that America is ill peopled. That Negroland is well peopled is pa&s;t doubt, con&s;idering the great annual draughts from that country to America, without any apparent diminution of numbers. In&s;tances are not extremely rare of 200 children born to one man by his different wives. Food mu&s;t be ex|tremely plentiful to enable a man to maintain &s;o many children. It would require extraordinary &s;kill and labour to make Europe &s;o populous: an acre and an half of wheat is barely &s;ufficient to maintain a &s;ingle family of pea&s;ants; and their
<PB N="60" REF="72">
cloathing requires many more acres. A country of &s;avages, who live chiefly by hunting, mu&s;t be very thin of inhabitants; as 10,000 or double that number of acres are no more than &s;ufficient for maintaining a &s;ingle family. If the multiplication of animals depended chiefly on fecundity, wolves would be more numerous than &s;heep: a great pro|portion of the latter are deprived of the procreating power, and many more of them are killed than of the former: yet we &s;ee every where large flocks of &s;heep, &s;eldom a wolf; for what rea&s;on, other than that the former have plenty of food, the latter very little? A wolf re&s;embles a &s;avage who lives by hunting, and con&s;umes the game of five or &s;ix hundred acres.</P>
<P>Waving the que&s;tion, Whether the human race be the offspring of one pair, or of many, it appears the intention of Providence, that the earth &s;hould be peopled, and population be kept up by the ordi|nary means of procreation. By the&s;e means a tribe &s;oon becomes too populous for the primitive &s;tate of hunting and fi&s;hing: it may even become too populous for the &s;hepherd-&s;tate; but probably a nation can &s;carce be too populous for hu&s;bandry. In the two former &s;tates, food mu&s;t decrea&s;e in quantity as con&s;umers increa&s;e in number: but agriculture has the &s;ignal property of producing, by indu&s;try, food in proportion to the number of con|&s;umers. In fact the greate&s;t quantities of corn and of cattle are commonly produced in the mo&s;t popu|lous di&s;tricts, where each family has its proportion of land An ancient Roman, &s;ober and indu&s;trious, made a &s;hift to maintain his family on the product of a few acres<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scotland mu&s;t have been very ill peopled in the days of its fifth James, when at one hunting in the high country of Roxburgh&s;hire, that Prince killed three hun|dred and &s;ixty red-deer; and in Athol, at another time, &s;ix hundred, be&s;ides roes, wolves, foxes, and wild cats.</NOTE>.</P>

The bounty given in Britain for exporting corn is friendly to population in two re&s;pects; fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e hu&s;bandry requires many hands; and, next, becau&s;e the bounty lowers the price of corn at home. To give a bounty for exporting cattle would ob|&s;truct population; becau&s;e pa&s;ture requires few hands, and exportation would rai&s;e the price of cattle at home. From the &s;ingle port of Cork, an. 1735, were exported 107, 161 barrels of beef, 7379 barrels of pork, 13, 401 ca&s;ks of butter, and 85, 727 firkins of the &s;ame commodity.

<P>Lapland is but thinly inhabited even for the &s;hepherd-&s;tate, the country being capable of main|taining a greater number of rain-deer, and con&s;e|quently a greater number of the human &s;pecies than are found in it. At the &s;ame time, the Lap|landers are well acquainted with private property: every family has tame rain deer of their own, to the extent &s;ometimes of four or five hundred. They indeed &s;eem to have more rain-deer than there is a demand for. Why then is Lapland &s;o thinly peopled? Either it mu&s;t have been but lately plant|ed, or the inhabitants are not prolific. I incline to the latter, upon the authority of Scheffer. Tar|tary is al&s;o but thinly peopled; and as I find not that the Tartars are le&s;s prolific than their neigh|bours, it is probable that Tartary, being the mo&s;t barren country in A&s;ia, has not been early planted. At the &s;ame time population has been much re|tarded
<PB N="62" REF="74">
by the re&s;tle&s;s and roaming &s;pirit of that people: it is true, they have been forced into the &s;hepherd-&s;tate by want of food; but &s;o aver&s;e are they to the &s;edentary life of a &s;hepherd, that they tru&s;t their cattle to &s;laves, and per&s;evere in their favourite occupation of hunting. This di&s;po&s;ition has been a dreadful pe&s;t to the human &s;pecies, the Tartars having made more exten&s;ive conque&s;ts, and de&s;troy'd more men, than any other nation known in hi&s;tory: more cruel than tigers, they &s;eemed to have no delight but in blood and ma&s;|&s;acre, without any regard either to &s;ex or age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the Tartars under Genhizkan conquered China, it was &s;eriou&s;ly deliberated, whether they &s;hould not kill all the inhabitants, and convert that va&s;t coun|try into pa&s;ture-fields for their cattle.</NOTE>. Luckily for the human &s;pecies, rich &s;poils dazzled their eyes, and rou&s;ed an appetite for wealth. Avarice is &s;ometimes productive of good: it moved the&s;e mon&s;ters to &s;ell the conquered people for &s;laves, which pre&s;erved the lives of millions. Con|que&s;ts, however &s;ucce&s;sful, cannot go on for ever; they are not accompli&s;hed without great lo&s;s of men; and the conque&s;ts of the Tartars depopulated their country.</P>
<P>But as &s;ome centuries have elap&s;ed without any con&s;iderable eruption of that &s;iery people, their numbers mu&s;t at pre&s;ent be con&s;iderable by the ordinary progre&s;s of population. Have we not rea|&s;on to dread new eruptions, like what formerly happened? Our foreknowledge of future events extends not far; but &s;o far as it extends, we have nothing to fear from that quarter. The Tartars &s;ubdued a great part of the world by ferocity and undaunted courage, &s;upported by liberty and inde|pendence. They acknowledged Genhizkan as their leader in war; but were as far from being &s;laves,

as the Franks were when they conquered Gaul. Tamerlane again enjoyed but a &s;ub&s;tituted power, and never had the audacity to a&s;&s;ume the title of Chan or Emperor. But the Tartars have &s;ubmit|ted to the &s;ame yoke of de&s;poti&s;m that their ferocity impo&s;ed upon others; and being now governed by a number of petty tyrants, their courage is broken by &s;lavery, and they are no longer formidable to the re&s;t of mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gallos in bellis florui&s;&s;e accepimus,"</Q> &s;ays Ta|citus in his life of Agricola; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"mox &s;egnities cum otio intravit, ami&s;&s;a virtute pariter ac libertate."</Q>&mdash;[In Engli&s;h thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have heard that the Gauls for|merly made a figure in war; but becoming a prey to indolence, the con&s;equence of peace, they lo&s;t at once their valour and their liberty."]</Q>&mdash;Spain, which defended it&s;elf with great bravery again&s;t the Romans, became an ea&s;y prey to the Vandals in the fifth cen|tury.

<P>Depopulation enters into the pre&s;ent &s;ketch as well as population. The latter follows not with greater certainty from equality of property, than the former from inequality. In every great &s;tate, where the people, by pro&s;perity and opulence, are &s;unk into voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, we hear daily complaints of depopulation. Cookery depopulates like a pe&s;|tilence; becau&s;e when it becomes an art, it brings within the compa&s;s of one &s;tomach what is &s;uffi|cient for ten in days of temperance; and is &s;o far wor&s;e than a pe&s;tilence, that the people never re|cruit again. The inhabitants of France devour at pre&s;ent more food than the &s;ame number did for|merly. The like is ob&s;ervable in Britain, and in every country where luxury abounds. Remedies are propo&s;ed and put in practice, celebacy di&s;graced, marriage encouraged, and rewards given for a nu|merous
<PB N="64" REF="76">
offspring All in vain! The only effectual remedies are to encourage hu&s;bandry, and to re|pre&s;s luxury. Olivares hoped to re-people Spain by encouraging matrimony. Abderam, a Maho|metan king of Cordova, was a better politician. By encouraging indu&s;try, and procuring plenty of food, he re-peopled his kingdom in le&s;s than thirty years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A foundling ho&s;pital is a greater enemy to popu|lation than liberty to expo&s;e infants, which is permit|ted to parents in China, and in &s;ome other countries. Both of them indeed encourage matrimony: but in &s;uch ho&s;pitals, thou&s;ands peri&s;h yearly beyond the ordinary proportion; whereas few infants peri&s;h by the liberty of expo&s;ing them, parental affection generally prevailing over the di&s;tre&s;s of poverty. And, upon the whole, population gains more by that liberty than it lo&s;es.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Luxury is a deadly enemy to population, not only by intercepting food from the indu&s;trious, but by weakening the power of procreation. Indolence accompanies voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, or rather is a branch of it: women of rank &s;eldom move, but in chang|ing place employ others to move them; and a wo|man enervated by indolence and intemperance, is ill qualified for the &s;evere labour of child-bearing. Hence it is, that people of rank, where luxury prevails, are not prolific. This infirmity not only prevents population, but increa&s;es luxury, by ac|cumulating wealth among a few blood-relations. A barren woman among the labouring poor, is a wonder. Could women of rank be per&s;uaded to make a trial, they would find more &s;elf-enjoyment in temperance and exerci&s;e, than in the mo&s;t re|fined luxury; and would have no cau&s;e to envy others the ble&s;&s;ing of a numerous and healthy off|&s;pring.</P>
<P>Luxury is not a greater enemy to population by enervating men and women, than de&s;poti&s;m is by
<PB N="65" REF="77">
reducing them to &s;lavery, and de&s;troying indu&s;try. De&s;poti&s;m is a greater pe&s;t to the human &s;pecies than an Egyptian plague; for by rendering men mi&s;erable, it weakens both the appetite for pro|creation and the power. Free &s;tates, on the con|trary, are always populous: a man who is happy longs for children to make them al&s;o happy; and indu&s;try enables him to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e. This ob&s;ervation is verified from the hi&s;tory of Greece, and of the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia: the inhabitants anciently were free and extremely numerous: the pre&s;ent inhabitants, reduced to &s;lavery, make a very poor figure with re&s;pect to numbers. A pe&s;|tilence de&s;troys tho&s;e only who exi&s;t, and the lo&s;s is &s;oon repaired; but de&s;poti&s;m, as above ob&s;erved, &s;trikes at the very root of population.</P>
<P>An overflowing quantity of money in circulation, is another cau&s;e of depopulation. In a nation that grows rich by commerce, the price of labour in|crea&s;es with the quantity of circulating money, which of cour&s;e rai&s;es the price of manufactures; and manufacturers who cannot find a vent for their high-rated goods in foreign markets, mu&s;t give over bu&s;ine&s;s, and commence beggars, or retire to another country where they may have a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. But luckily, there is a remedy in that ca&s;e to prevent depopulation: land is cultivated to greater perfection by the &s;pade than by the plough; and the more plentiful crops produced by the &s;pade are more than &s;ufficient to defray the additional ex|pence of cultivation. This is a re&s;ource for em|ploying tho&s;e who cannot make bread as manu|facturers; and de&s;erves well the attention of the legi&s;lature. The advantage of the &s;pade is con&s;pi|cuous with re&s;pect to war; it provides a multitude of robu&s;t men for recruiting our armies, the want of whom may be &s;upplied by the plough, till they return in peace to their former occupation.</P>

<HEAD>Progre&s;s of Men with re&s;pect to PROPERTY.</HEAD>
<P>AMong the &s;en&s;es inherent in the nature of man, the &s;en&s;e of property is eminent. By this &s;en&s;e wild animals caught by labour or art, are perceived to belong to the hunter or fi&s;her; they become his property. This &s;en&s;e is the foundation of meum et tuum, a di&s;tinction of which no human being is ignorant. In the &s;hepherd-&s;tate, there is the &s;ame perception of property with re&s;pect to wild animals tamed for u&s;e, and al&s;o with re&s;pect to their progeny. It takes place al&s;o with re&s;pect to a field &s;eparated from the common, and culti|vated by a man for bread to him&s;elf and family<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Principles of Morality and Natural Religion, p. 77. edit. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of property is &s;lower in its growth toward maturity than the external &s;en&s;es, which are perfect even in childhood; but ripens fa&s;ter than the &s;en&s;e of congruity, of &s;ymmetry, of dig|nity, of grace, and other delicate &s;en&s;es, which &s;carce make any figure till we become men. Chil|dren di&s;cover a &s;en&s;e of property in di&s;tingui&s;hing their own chair, and their own &s;poon. In them however it is faint and ob&s;cure, requiring time to bring it to perfection. The gradual progre&s;s of that &s;en&s;e, from its infancy among &s;avages to its maturity among poli&s;hed nations, is one of the mo&s;t entertaining articles that belong to the pre&s;ent un|dertaking. But as that article makes a part of Hi&s;torical law-tracts<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Tract 3.</NOTE>, nothing remains for me but a few gleanings.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="79">
Man is by nature a hoarding animal, having an appetite for &s;toring up things of u&s;e; and the &s;en&s;e of property is be&s;tow'd on men, for &s;ecuring to them what they thus &s;tore up. Hence it appears, that things provided by Providence for our &s;u&s;te|nance and accommodation, were not intended to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common; and probably in the ear|lie&s;t ages every man &s;eparately hunted for him&s;elf and his family. But chance prevails in that occu|pation; and it may frequently happen, that while &s;ome get more than enough, others mu&s;t go &s;up|perle&s;s to bed. Sen&s;ible of that inconvenience, it crept into practice, for hunting and fi&s;hing to be carried on in common<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inequalities of chance, which are great in a few in&s;tances, vani&s;h almo&s;t entirely when the operation is frequently reiterated during a cour&s;e of time. Did every man's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depend on the fruits of his own field, many would die of hunger, while others wallowed in plenty. Barter and commerce among the inhabitants of a di&s;trict, le&s;&s;en the hazard of famine: the commerce of corn through a large kingdom, &s;uch as France or Britain, le&s;&s;ens it &s;till more: extend that commerce through Europe, through the world, and there will remain &s;carce a ve&s;tige of the inequalities of chance: the crop of corn may fail in one province, or in one kingdom; but that it &s;hould fail univer&s;ally is beyond the varieties of chance. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds in every other matter of chance: one's gain or lo&s;s at game for a night, for a week, may be con&s;iderable; but carry on the game for a year, and &s;o little of chance remains, that it is almo&s;t the &s;ame whether one play for a guinea or for twenty. Hence a &s;kilful in&s;urer never ventures much upon one bottom; but multiplies his bargains as much as po&s;&s;ible: the more bargains he is engaged in, the greater is the probability of &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE>. We find accordingly the practice of hunting and fi&s;hing in common, even among gro&s;s &s;avages. Tho&s;e of New Holland, above mentioned, live upon &s;mall fi&s;h dug out of
<PB N="68" REF="80">
the &s;and when the &s;ea retires. Sometimes they get plenty, &s;ometimes very little; but whether &s;uc|ce&s;sful or un&s;ucce&s;sful, all is broiled and ate in common. After eating they go to re&s;t: they re|turn to their fi&s;hing next ebb of the tide, whether it be day or night, foul or fair; for go they mu&s;t, or &s;tarve. In &s;mall tribes, where patrioti&s;m is vigorous, or in a country thinly peopled in propor|tion to its fertility, the living in common is ex|tremely comfortable: but in a large &s;tate where &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s prevails, or in any &s;tate where great po|pulation requires extraordinary culture, the be&s;t method is to allow every man to &s;hift for him&s;elf and his family: men wi&s;h to labour for them&s;elves; and they labour more ardently for them&s;elves than for the public. Private property became more and more &s;acred in the progre&s;s of arts and manufac|tures: to allow an arti&s;t of &s;uperior talents no pro|fit above others, would be a &s;ad di&s;couragement to indu&s;try, and be &s;carce con&s;i&s;tent with common ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of property is not confined to the human &s;pecies. The beavers perceive the timber they &s;tore up for food, to be their property; and the bees &s;eem to have the &s;ame perception with re&s;pect to their winter's provi&s;ion of honey. Sheep know when they are in a tre&s;pa&s;s, and run to their own pa&s;ture on the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of a man. Monkies do the &s;ame when detected in robbing an orchard. Sheep and horned cattle have a &s;en&s;e of property with re&s;pect to their re&s;ting-place in a fold or in|clo&s;ure, which every one guards again&s;t the in|croachments of others. He mu&s;t be a &s;ceptic in|deed who denies that perception to rooks: thieves there are among them as among men; but if a rook purloin a &s;tick from another's ne&s;t, a council is held, much chattering en&s;ues, and the lex ta|lionis is applied, by demoli&s;hing the ne&s;t of the
<PB N="69" REF="81">
criminal. To man are furni&s;hed rude materials only: to convert the&s;e into food and cloathing re|quires indu&s;try; and if he had not a &s;en&s;e that the product of his labour belongs to him&s;elf, his in|du&s;try would be extremely faint. In general, it is plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve, that the &s;en&s;e of property is always given where it is u&s;eful, and never but where it is u&s;eful.</P>
<P>An ingenious writer, de&s;cribing the inhabitants of Guiana, who continue hunters and fi&s;hers, makes an eloquent harangue upon the happine&s;s they en|joy, in having few wants and de&s;ires, and in hav|ing very little notion of private property. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The manners of the&s;e Indians exhibit an amiable pic|ture of primeval innocence and happine&s;s. The ea&s;e with which their few wants are &s;upplied, renders divi&s;ion of land unnece&s;&s;ary; nor does it afford any temptation to fraud or violence. That pronene&s;s to vice, which among civilized nations is e&s;teemed a propen&s;ity of nature, has no ex|i&s;tence in a country where every man enjoys in perfection his native freedom and independence, without hurting or being hurt by others. A perfect equality of rank, bani&s;hing all di&s;tinctions but of age and per&s;onal merit, promotes freedom in conver&s;ation, and firmne&s;s in action; and &s;ugge&s;ts no de&s;ires but what may be gratified with innocence. Envy and di&s;content cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with perfect equality; we &s;carce even hear of a di&s;contented lover, as there is no dif|ference of rank and fortune, the common ob|&s;tacles that prevent fruition. Tho&s;e who have been unhappily accu&s;tomed to the refinements of luxury, will &s;carce be able to conceive, that an Indian, with no covering but what mode&s;ty requires, with no &s;helter that de&s;erves the name of a hou&s;e, and with no food but of the coar&s;e&s;t kind painfully procured by hunting, can feel any

happine&s;s: and yet to judge from external ap|pearance, the happine&s;s of the&s;e people may be envied by the wealthy of the mo&s;t refined na|tions; and ju&s;tly; becau&s;e their ignorance of extravagant de&s;ires, and endle&s;s pur&s;uits that torment the great world, excludes every wi&s;h beyond the pre&s;ent. In a word, the inhabitants of Guiana are an example of what Socrates ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that tho&s;e who want the lea&s;t, approach the neare&s;t to the Gods, who want nothing."</Q> It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the innocence of &s;avages, here painted in fine colours, is in every re&s;pect more amiable than the luxury of opulent cities, where &s;en&s;uality and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s are ruling pa&s;&s;ions. But is our author unacquainted with a middle &s;tate between the two extremes, more &s;uitable than either to the dignity of human nature? The appetite for property is not be&s;tow'd upon us in vain: it has given birth to many u&s;eful arts, and to almo&s;t all the fine arts; it is &s;till more u&s;eful in furni&s;hing opportunity for gratifying the mo&s;t dignified natural affections; for without pri|vate property, what place would there be for bene|volence or charity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>? Without private property, there would be no indu&s;try; and without indu&s;try, men would remain &s;avages for ever.</P>
<P>The appetite for property, in its nature a great ble&s;&s;ing, degenerates, I acknowledge, into a great cur&s;e when it tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the bounds of moderation. Before money was introduced, the appetite &s;eldom was immoderate, becau&s;e plain nece&s;&s;aries were its only objects. But money is a &s;pecies of property, of &s;uch exten&s;ive u&s;e as greatly to inflame the ap|petite. Money prompts men to be indu&s;trious; and the beautiful productions of indu&s;try and art, rou&s;ing the imagination, excite a violent de&s;ire of
<PB N="71" REF="83">
fine hou&s;es, ornamented gardens, and of every thing gay and &s;plendid. Habitual wants multiply: luxury and &s;en&s;uality gain ground: the appetitie for property becomes head&s;trong, and mu&s;t be grati|fied even at the expence of ju&s;tice and honour. Examples are without number of this progre&s;s; and yet the following hi&s;tory de&s;erves to be kept in memory, as a &s;triking and lamentable illu&s;tration. Hi&s;paniola was that part of America which Co|lumbus fir&s;t di&s;covered anno 1497. He landed upon the territory of Guacanaric, one of the prin|cipal Cacics of the i&s;land. That prince, who had nothing barbarous in his manners, received his gue&s;ts with cordiality; and encouraged his people to vie with one another in obliging them. To gratify the Spani&s;h appetite for gold, they parted freely with their riche&s;t ornaments; and in return, were &s;atisfied with gla&s;s beads, and &s;uch baubles. The Admiral's &s;hip having been to&s;&s;ed again&s;t the rocks in a hurricane, Guacanaric was not wanting to his friend on that occa&s;ion: he convened a num|ber of men to a&s;&s;i&s;t in unloading the &s;hip; and attended him&s;elf till the cargo was &s;afely lodged in a magazine. The Admiral having occa&s;ion to return to Spain, left a part of his crew behind; who, forgetting the le&s;&s;ons of moderation he had taught them, turned licentious. The remon&s;tran|ces of Guacanaric were in vain: they &s;eized upon the gold and wives of the Indians; and in general treated them with great cruelty. Such enormities did not long pa&s;s unre&s;ented: the rapacious Spa|niards, after much blood&s;hed, were &s;hut up in their fort, and reduced to extremity. Unhappily a reinforcement arrived from Spain: a long and bloody war en&s;ued, which did not end till the i&s;land|ers were wholly brought under. Of this i&s;land, about 200 leagues in length and between &s;ixty and
<PB N="72" REF="84">
eighty in breadth, a Spani&s;h hi&s;torian bears witne&s;s, that the inhabitants amounted to a million when Columbus landed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As little corn was at that time produced in the i&s;land, and le&s;s of animal food, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;|pect, that the numbers are exaggerated. But whether a million, or half of that number, the moral is the &s;ame.</NOTE>. The Spaniards, relentle&s;s in their cruelty, forc'd the&s;e poor people to abandon the culture of their fields, and to retire to the woods and mountains. Hunted like wild bea&s;ts even in the&s;e retreats, they fled from mountain to moun|tain, till hunger and fatigue, which de&s;troy'd more than the &s;word, forc'd them to deliver them&s;elves up to their implacable conquerors. There remained at that time but 60,000, who were divided among the Spaniards as &s;laves. Exce&s;&s;ive fatigue in the mines, and want of even the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, reduced them in five years to 14,000. Con|&s;idering them merely as bea&s;ts of burden, they would have yielded more profit had they been treated with le&s;s inhumanity. Avarice frequently counteracts its own end: by gra&s;ping too much, it lo&s;es all. The Emperor Charles re&s;olved to apply &s;ome effectual remedy; but being interrupted for &s;ome time by various avocations, he got intelligence that the poor Indians were totally extirpated. And they were &s;o in reality, a handful excepted, who lay hid in the mountains, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted as by a mi|racle in the mid&s;t of their enemies. That handful were di&s;covered many years after by &s;ome hunters; who treated them with humanity, regretting per|haps the barbarity of their forefathers. The poor Indians, docile and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, embraced the Chri&s;|tian religion, and a&s;&s;umed by degrees the manners

and cu&s;toms of their ma&s;ters. They &s;till exi&s;t, and live by hunting and fi&s;hing.</P>

<HEAD>Origin and Progre&s;s of COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE few wants of men in the fir&s;t &s;tage of &s;ociety, are &s;upplied by barter or permutation in its rude&s;t form. In barter, the rational con&s;ide|ration is, what is wanted by the one, and what can be &s;pared by the other. But &s;avages are not always &s;o clear-&s;ighted: a &s;avage who wants a knife will give for it any thing that is le&s;s u&s;eful to him at pre&s;ent; without con&s;idering either the pre&s;ent wants of the per&s;on he is dealing with, or his own future wants. An inhabitant of Guiana will for a fi&s;h-hook give more at one time, than at another he will give for a hatchet, or for a gun. Kempfer reports, that an inhabitant of Puli Timor, an i&s;land adjacent to Malacca, will, for a bit of coar&s;e linen not worth three halfpence, give provi&s;ions worth three or four &s;hillings. But people improve by degrees, attending to what is wanted and to what can be &s;pared on both &s;ides; and in that le&s;&s;on, the American &s;avages in our neighbourhood are not a little expert.</P>
<P>Barter or permutation, in its original form, proved mi&s;erably deficient, when men and their wants multiplied. That &s;ort of commerce cannot be carried on at a di&s;tance; and even among neigh|bours, it does not always happen, that the one can &s;pare what the other wants. Barter is &s;omewhat enlarged by covenants: a bu&s;hel of wheat is deli|vered to me, upon my promi&s;ing an equivalent at
<PB N="75" REF="87">
a future time. But what if I have nothing that my neighbour may have occa&s;ion for? or what if my promi&s;e be not relied on? Thus barter, even with the aid of covenants, proves &s;till in&s;ufficient. The numberle&s;s wants of men cannot readily be &s;upplied without &s;ome commodity in general e&s;ti|mation, that will be gladly accepted in exchange for every other article of commerce. That com|modity ought not to be bulky, nor be expen&s;ive in keeping, nor be con&s;umable by time. Gold and &s;ilver are metals which po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e properties in an eminent degree. They are at the &s;ame time per|fectly homogeneous in whatever country produced: two ma&s;&s;es of pure gold or of pure &s;ilver are always equal in value, provided they be of the &s;ame weight. The&s;e metals are al&s;o divi&s;ible into &s;mall parts, convenient to be given for goods of &s;mall value.</P>
<P>Gold and &s;ilver, when fir&s;t introduced into com|merce, were probably bartered, like other com|modities, by bulk merely. Rock-&s;alt in Ethiopia, white as &s;now and hard as &s;tone, is to this day bartered in that manner with other goods. It is dug out of the mountain Lafta, formed into plates of a foot long, and three inches broad and thick; and a portion is broke off equivalent in value to the thing wanted. But more nicety came to be intro|duced into the commerce of gold and &s;ilver: in&s;tead of being given loo&s;ely by bulk, every portion was weighed in &s;cales: and this method of barter is practi&s;ed in China, in Ethiopia, and in many other countries. Even weight was at length di&s;co|vered to be an imperfect &s;tandard. Ethiopian &s;alt may be proof again&s;t adulteration; but weight is no &s;ecurity again&s;t mixing gold and &s;ilver with ba&s;e metals. To prevent that fraud, pieces of gold and &s;ilver are impre&s;&s;ed with a public &s;tamp, vouching both the purity and quantity; and &s;uch pieces are
<PB N="76" REF="88">
termed coin. This was a notable improvement in commerce; and, like other improvements, was probably at fir&s;t thought the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of human invention. It was not fore&s;een, that the&s;e metals wear by much handling in the cour&s;e of circulation; and con&s;equently, that in time the public &s;tamp is reduced to be a voucher of the pu|rity only, not of the quantity. Hence proceed manifold inconveniences; for which no other re|medy occurs, but to re&s;tore the former method of weighing, tru&s;ting to the &s;tamp for the purity only. This proves an embarra&s;&s;ment in commerce; but it will facilitate paper-money, which is free of that embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>When gold or &s;ilver in bullion is exchanged with other commodities, &s;uch commerce pa&s;&s;es under the common name of barter or permutation: when current coin is exchanged, &s;uch commerce is term|ed buying and &s;elling; and the money exchanged is termed the price of the goods.</P>
<P>As commerce cannot be carried on to any extent without a &s;tandard for comparing goods of different kinds, and as every commercial country is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a &s;tandard, it &s;eems difficult to &s;ay by what means the &s;tandard has been e&s;tabli&s;hed. It is plainly not founded on nature; for the different kinds of goods have naturally no common mea&s;ure by which they can be valued: two quarters of wheat can be compared with twenty; but what rule have we to compare wheat with broad cloth, or either of them with gold, or gold even with &s;ilver or copper? Several ingenious writers have endeavoured to account for the comparative value of commodities, by reducing them all to the labour employ'd in rai&s;ing food: which labour is &s;aid to be a &s;tandard for mea&s;uring the value of all other labour, and con&s;equently of all things produced by labour. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If, for example, a bu&s;hel of wheat and
<PB N="77" REF="89">
an ounce of &s;ilver be produced by the &s;ame quantity of labour, will they not be equal in value?"</Q> This &s;tandard is imperfect in many re&s;pects. I ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, that to give it a rational appearance, there is a nece&s;&s;ity to maintain, con|trary to fact, that all materials on which labour is employ'd are of equal value. It requires as much labour to make a bra&s;s candle&s;tick as one of &s;ilver, tho' far from being of the &s;ame value. A bu&s;hel of wheat may &s;ometimes equal in value an ounce of &s;ilver; but an ounce of gold does not always re|quire more labour than a bu&s;hel of wheat; and yet they differ widely in value. The value of labour, it is true, enters into the value of every thing pro|duced by it; but is far from making the whole value. If an ounce of &s;ilver were of no greater value than the labour of procuring it, that ounce would go for payment of the labour, and nothing be left to the proprietor of the mine: &s;uch a doc|trine will not reli&s;h with the King of Spain; and as little with the Kings of Golconda and Portugal, proprietors of diamond mines. Secondly, The &s;tandard under review &s;uppo&s;es every &s;ort of labour to be of equal value, which however will not be maintained. An u&s;eful art in great reque&s;t may not be generally known: the few who are &s;kilful may ju&s;tly demand more for their labour than the common rate. An expert hu&s;bandman be&s;tows no more labour in rai&s;ing an hundred bu&s;hels of wheat, than his ignorant neighbour in rai&s;ing fifty: if labour be the only &s;tandard, the two crops ought to afford the &s;ame price. Was not Raphael intitled to a higher price for one of his fine tablatures, than a dunce is for a tavern-&s;ign, &s;uppo&s;ing the labour to have been equal? La&s;tly, as this &s;tandard is applicable to things only that require labour, what rule is to be followed with re&s;pect to natural fruits, and other things that require no labour?</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="90">
Laying a&s;ide then this attempt to fix a &s;tandard, it occurs to me, that the value of a commodity depends chiefly, tho' not &s;olely, on the demand. Quantity beyond the demand renders even nece&s;|&s;aries of no value; of which water is an in&s;tance. It may be held accordingly as a general rule, That the value of goods in commerce depends on a de|mand beyond what their quantity can &s;atisfy; and ri&s;es in proportion to the exce&s;s of the demand above the quantity. Even water becomes valuable in countries where the demand exceeds the quantity: in arid regions, &s;prings of water are highly valued; and in old times were frequently the occa&s;ion of broils and blood&s;hed. Comparing next different commodities with re&s;pect to value, that commodity of which the exce&s;s of the demand above the quan|tity is the greater, will be of the greater value. Were utility or intrin&s;ic value only to be con&s;idered, a pound of iron would be worth ten pounds of gold; but as the exce&s;s of the demand for gold above its quantity is much greater than that of iron, the latter is of le&s;s value in the market. A pound of opium or of Je&s;uit's bark is, for its &s;alutary effects, more valuable than gold; and yet, for the rea&s;on given, a pound of gold will purcha&s;e many pounds of the&s;e drugs. Thus, in general, the exce&s;s of the demand above the quantity is the &s;tandard that chiefly fixes the mercantile value of commodities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a voyage to Arabia Foelix, ann. 1708, by a French &s;hip, the King of the territory where the crew landed, gave them an ox weighing a thou&s;and or twelve hundred pounds for a fu&s;ee, and three &s;core pounds weight of rice for twenty-eight ounces of gun-powder. The goods bartered were e&s;timated according to the wants of each party, or, in other words, according to the demand above the quantity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="91">
The cau&s;es that make a demand, &s;eem not &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;certained. One thing is evident, that the demand for nece&s;&s;aries in any country, mu&s;t depend on the number of its inhabitants. This rule holds not &s;o &s;trictly in articles of convenience; becau&s;e &s;ome people are more greedy of conveniencies than others. As to articles of ta&s;te and luxury, the de|mand appears &s;o arbitrary as &s;carce to be reducible to any rule. A ta&s;te for beauty is general; but &s;o different in different per&s;ons, as to make the demand extremely variable: the faint repre&s;entation of any plant in an agate, is valued by &s;ome for its rarity; but the demand is far from being univer&s;al. Sava|ges are de&s;pi&s;ed for being fond of gla&s;s beads; but were &s;uch toys equally rare among us, they would be coveted by many: a copper coin of the Empe|ror Otho is of no intrin&s;ic value; and yet, for its rarity, would draw a great price.</P>
<P>The value of gold and &s;ilver in commerce, like that of other commodities, was at fir&s;t, we may believe, both arbitrary and fluctuating; and, like other commodities, they found in time their value in the market. With re&s;pect to value, however, there is a great difference between money and other commodities. Goods that are expen&s;ive in keeping, &s;uch as cattle, or that are impaired by time, &s;uch as corn, will always be fir&s;t offered in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">change for what is wanted; and when &s;uch goods are offered to &s;ale, the vender mu&s;t be contented with the cur|rent price: in making the bargain the purcha&s;er has the advantage; for he &s;uffers not by re&s;erving his money to a better market. And thus commodities are brought down by money to the lowe&s;t value that can afford any profit. At the &s;ame time, gold and &s;ilver &s;ooner find their value than other commodities. The value of the latter is regulated both by the quantity and by the demand; the value of the for|mer is regulated by the quantity only, the demand
<PB N="80" REF="92">
being unbounded: and even with re&s;pect to quanti|ty, the&s;e precious metals are le&s;s variable than other commodities.</P>
<P>Gold and &s;ilver being thus &s;ooner fixed in their value than other commodities, become a &s;tandard for valuing every other commodity, and con&s;equent|ly for comparative values. A bu&s;hel of wheat, for example, being valued at five &s;hillings, a yard of broad cloth at fifteen, their comparative values are as one to three.</P>
<P>A &s;tandard of values is e&s;&s;ential to commerce; and therefore where gold and &s;ilver are unknown, other &s;tandards are e&s;tabli&s;hed by practice. The only &s;tandard among the &s;avages of North America is the &s;kin of a beaver. Ten of the&s;e are given for a gun, two for a pound of gun-powder, one for four pounds of lead, one for &s;ix knives, one for a hatchet, &s;ix for a coat of woollen cloth, five for a petticoat, and one for a pound of tobacco. Some nations in Africa employ &s;hells, termed couries, for a &s;tand|ard.</P>
<P>As my chief view in this &s;ketch is, to examine how far indu&s;try and commerce are affected by the quantity of circulating coin, I premi&s;e, in that view, the following plain propo&s;itions: Suppo&s;ing, fir&s;t, the quantity of money in circulation, and the quan|tity of goods in the market, to continue the &s;ame, the price will ri&s;e and fall with the demand. For when more goods are demanded than the market affords, tho&s;e who offer the highe&s;t price will be preferred: as, on the other hand, when the goods brought to market exceed the demand, the venders have no re&s;ource but to entice purcha&s;ers by a low price. The price of fi&s;h, fle&s;h, butter, and chee&s;e, is much higher than formerly; for the&s;e being now the daily food even of the lowe&s;t people, the de|mand for them is greatly increa&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="93">
Suppo&s;ing now a fluctuation in the quantity of goods only, the price falls as the quantity increa&s;es, and ri&s;es as the quantity decrea&s;es. The farmer who&s;e quantity of corn is doubled by a favourable &s;ea&s;on, mu&s;t &s;ell at half the u&s;ual price; becau&s;e the purcha&s;er, who &s;ees a &s;uperfluity, will pay no more for it. The contrary happens upon a &s;canty crop: tho&s;e who want corn mu&s;t &s;tarve, or give the market-price, however high. The manufac|tures of wool, flax, and metals, are much cheaper than formerly; for tho' the demand has increa&s;ed, yet by &s;kill and indu&s;try the quantities produced have increa&s;ed in a greater proportion. More pot|herbs are con&s;umed than formerly; and yet by &s;kil|ful culture the quantity is &s;o much greater in pro|portion, as to have lowered the price to le&s;s than one half of what it was eighty years ago.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to combine the quantity and demand, &s;uppo&s;ing a fluctuation in both. Where the quan|tity exceeds the u&s;ual demand, more people will be tempted to purcha&s;e by the low price; and where the demand ri&s;es con&s;iderably above the quantity, the price will ri&s;e in proportion. In mathematical language, the&s;e propo&s;itions may be thus expre&s;&s;ed, that the price is directly as the demand, and in|ver&s;ely as the quantity.</P>
<P>A variation in the quantity of circulating coin is the mo&s;t intricate circum&s;tance; becau&s;e it never happens without making a variation in the demand for goods, and frequently in the quantity. I take the liberty however to &s;uppo&s;e, that there is no va|riation but in the quantity of circulating coin; for tho' that cannot happen in reality, yet the re&s;ult of the &s;uppo&s;ition will throw light upon what really happens: the &s;ubject is involved, and I wi&s;h to make it plain. I put a &s;imple ca&s;e, that the half of our current coin is at once &s;wept away by &s;ome ex|traordinary accident. This at fir&s;t will embarra&s;s
<PB N="82" REF="94">
our internal commerce, as the vender will in&s;i&s;t for the u&s;ual price, which now cannot be afforded. But the error of &s;uch demand will &s;oon be di&s;cover|ed; and the price of commodities, after &s;ome fluc|tuation, will &s;ettle at the one half of what it was formerly. At the &s;ame time, there is here no down|fal in the value of commodities, which cannot hap|pen while the quantity and demand continue unva|ried. The purcha&s;ing for a &s;ixpence what formerly co&s;t a &s;hilling, makes no alteration in the value of the things purcha&s;ed; becau&s;e a &s;ixpence is equal in value to what a &s;hilling was formerly. In a word, when money is &s;carce, it mu&s;t bear a high value: it mu&s;t in particular go far in the purcha&s;e of goods; which we expre&s;s by &s;aying, that goods are cheap.&mdash;Put next the ca&s;e, that by &s;ome accident our &s;pecie is in&s;tantly doubled. Upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the quantity and demand continue unvaried, the re|&s;ult mu&s;t be, not in&s;tantaneous indeed, to double the price of commodities. Upon the former &s;uppo|&s;ition, a &s;ixpence is in effect advanced to be a &s;hil|ling: upon the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, a &s;hilling has in effect &s;unk down to a &s;ixpence. And here again it ought to be ob&s;erved, that tho' the price is augment|ed, there is no real alteration in the value of com|modities. A bullock that, &s;ome years ago, could have been purcha&s;ed for ten pounds, will at pre&s;ent yield fifteen. The vulgar ignorantly think, that the value of horned cattle has ri&s;en in that proporti|on. The advanced price may, in &s;ome degree, be occa&s;ioned by a greater con&s;umption; but it is chief|ly occa&s;ioned by a greater quantity of money in cir|culation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is commonly thought, that the rate of intere&s;t depends on the quantity of circulating coin; that intere&s;t will be high when money is &s;carce, and low when mo|ney abounds. But whatever be the cau&s;e of high or low intere&s;t, I am certain that the quantity of circulating coin can have no influence. Suppo&s;ing, as above, the half of our money to be withdrawn, a hundred pounds lent ought &s;till to afford but five pounds as intere&s;t; be|cau&s;e if the principal be doubled in value, &s;o is al&s;o the intere&s;t. If, on the other hand, the quantity of our money be doubled, the five pounds of intere&s;t will con|tinue to bear the &s;ame proportion to the principal as formerly.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="95">
Combining all the circum&s;tances, the re&s;ult is, that if the quantity of goods and of money continue the &s;ame, the price will be in proportion to the de|mand. If the demand and quantity of goods con|tinue the &s;ame, the price will be in proportion to the quantity of money. And if the demand and quantity of money continue the &s;ame, the price will fall as the quantity increa&s;es, and ri&s;e as the quan|tity dimini&s;hes.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;peculative notions will, I hope, enable us with accuracy to examine, how indu&s;try and commerce are affected by variations in the quantity of circulating coin. It is evident, that arts and ma|nufactures cannot be carried on to any extent, with|out coin. Hands totally employ'd in any art or manufacture require wages daily or weekly, becau&s;e they mu&s;t go to market for every nece&s;&s;ary of life. The clothier, the tailor, the &s;hoe-maker, the gar|dener, the farmer, mu&s;t employ &s;ervants to prepare their goods for the market, to whom, for that rea|&s;on, wages ought to be regularly paid. In a word, commerce among an endle&s;s number of individuals who depend on each other even for nece&s;&s;aries, would be altogether inextricable without a quantity of circulating coin. Money may be ju&s;tly conceiv|ed to be the oil, that lubricates all the &s;prings and wheels of a great machine, and pre&s;erves it in mo|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Money cannot be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be deficient where there is &s;ufficiency to purcha&s;e every commodity, includ|ing labour, that is wanted. Any greater quantity is hurtful to commerce, as will be &s;een afterward. But to be forc'd to contract debt even when one deals pru|dently and profitably, and con&s;equently to be &s;ubjected to legal execution, is a proof, by no means ambiguous, of &s;carcity of money; which till of late was remarkably the ca&s;e in Scotland.</NOTE>. <PB N="84" REF="96">
Suppo&s;ing us now to be provided with no more of that precious oil than is barely &s;ufficient for the ea&s;y motion of our indu&s;try and manufactures, a diminution of the nece&s;&s;ary quantity mu&s;t cramp all of them. Our indu&s;try and manufactures mu&s;t decay; and if we do not confine the expence of living to our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, which &s;eldom happens, the balance of trade with foreign nations will turn again&s;t us, and leave us no re&s;ource for making the balance equal, but to export our gold and &s;ilver. And when we are drained of the&s;e me|tals, farewell to arts and manufactures. We &s;hall be reduced to the condition of &s;avages, which is, that each individual depends entirely on his own labour for procuring every nece&s;&s;ary of life. The con&s;equences of a favourable balance are at fir&s;t di|rectly oppo&s;ite; but at the long-run come out to be the &s;ame: they are &s;weet in the mouth, but bitter in the &s;tomach. A bri&s;k influx of riches by a favourable balance, rou&s;es our activity. Plenty of money elevates our &s;pirits, and in&s;pires an appetite for plea&s;ure: we indulge a ta&s;te for &s;how and em|belli&s;hment; become ho&s;pitable, and refine upon the arts of luxury. Plenty of money is a prevailing motive even with the mo&s;t &s;edate, to exert them|&s;elves in building, in hu&s;bandry, in manufactures, and in other &s;olid improvements. Such articles re|quire both hands and materials, the prices of which are rai&s;ed by the additional demand. The labourer
<PB N="85" REF="97">
again who&s;e wages are thus rai&s;ed, is not now &s;atis|fied with mere nece&s;&s;aries; but in&s;i&s;ts for conveni|encies, the price of which al&s;o is rai&s;ed by the new demand. In &s;hort, increa&s;e of money rai&s;es the price of every commodity; partly from the greater quantity of money, and partly from the additional demand for &s;upplying artificial wants. Hitherto a delightful view of pro&s;perous commerce: but be|hold the remote con&s;equences. High wages will undoubtedly promote at fir&s;t the &s;pirit of indu&s;try, and double the quantity of labour: but the utmo&s;t exertion of labour is limited within certain bounds; and con&s;equently a perpetual influx of gold and &s;ilver will not for ever be attended with a proporti|onal quantity of work: The price of labour will ri&s;e in proportion to the quantity of money; but the produce will not ri&s;e in the &s;ame proportion; and for that rea&s;on our manufactures will be dearer than formerly. Hence a di&s;mal &s;cene. The high price at home of our manufactures will exclude us from foreign markets; for if the merchant cannot draw there for his goods what he paid at home, with &s;ome profit, he mu&s;t abandon foreign commerce altogether. And what is &s;till more di&s;|mal, we &s;hall be deprived even of our own mark|ets; for in &s;pite of the utmo&s;t vigilance, foreign commodities, cheaper than our own, will be pour|ed in upon us. The la&s;t &s;cene is to be deprived of our gold and &s;ilver, and reduced to the &s;ame mi&s;era|ble &s;tate as if the balance had been again&s;t us from the beginning.</P>
<P>However certain it may appear, that an aug|mentation in the quantity of money mu&s;t rai&s;e the price of labour and of manufactures, yet there is a fact that &s;eems to contradict the propo&s;ition, which is, that in no other country are labour and manufactures &s;o cheap as in the two penin&s;ulas on the right and left of the Ganges, tho' in no other
<PB N="86" REF="98">
country is there &s;uch plenty of money. To ac|count for this &s;ingular fact, political writers &s;ay, that money is there ama&s;&s;ed by the nabobs, and withdrawn from circulation. This is not &s;atisfac|tory: the chief exportation from the&s;e penin&s;ulas are their manufactures, the price of which comes fir&s;t to the merchant and manufacturer; and how can that happen without rai&s;ing the price of la|bour? Rice, it is true, is the food of their labour|ing poor; and an acre of rice yields more food than five acres of wheat: but the cheapne&s;s of nece&s;&s;aries, tho' it hath a con&s;iderable influence in keeping down the price of labour, cannot have an effect &s;o extraordinary as to keep it con&s;tantly down, in oppo&s;ition to an overflowing current of money. The populou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e two countries is a cir|cum&s;tance that has been totally overlooked. Every traveller is amazed how &s;uch &s;warms of people can find bread, however fertile the &s;oil may be. Let us examine that circum&s;tance. One thing is evi|dent, that were the people fully employed, there would not be a demand for the tenth part of their manufactures. Here then is a country where hand|labour is a drug for want of employment. The people at the &s;ame time, &s;ober and indu&s;trious, are glad to be employed at any rate; and whatever pittance is gained by labour makes always &s;ome addition. Hence it is, that in the&s;e penin&s;ulas, &s;uperfluity of hands overbalancing both the quan|tity of money and the demand for their manu|factures, &s;erves to keep the price extremely low.</P>
<P>What is now &s;aid di&s;covers an error in the pro|po&s;ition above laid down. It holds undoubtedly in Europe, and in every country where there is work for all the people, that an augmentation in the cir|culating coin rai&s;es the price of labour and of ma|nufactures: but &s;uch augmentation has no &s;en&s;ible effect in a country where there is a &s;uperfluity of
<PB N="87" REF="99">
hands, who are always di&s;po&s;ed to work when they find employment.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;es it will be evident, that un|le&s;s there be a &s;uperfluity of hands, manufactures can never flouri&s;h in a country abounding with mines of gold and &s;ilver. This in effect is the ca&s;e of Spain: a con&s;tant influx of the&s;e metals, rai&s;ing the price of labour and of manufactures, has de|prived the Spaniards of foreign markets, and al&s;o of their own: they are reduced to purcha&s;e from &s;trangers even the nece&s;&s;aries of life. What a di&s;mal condition will they be reduced to when their mines come to be exhau&s;ted!</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this ob&s;ervation, which indeed is of great importance, I enter more minutely into the condition of Spain. The rough materials of &s;ilk, wool, and iron, are produced there more perfect than in any other country; and yet flouri&s;hing ma|nufactures of the&s;e would be ruinous to it in its pre&s;ent &s;tate. Let us only &s;uppo&s;e that Spain it&s;elf could furni&s;h all the commodities that are de|manded in its American territories; what would be the con&s;equence? The gold and &s;ilver pro|duced by that trade would center and circulate in Spain: money would become a drug: labour and manufactures would ri&s;e to a high price; and every nece&s;&s;ary of life, not excepting manufac|tures of &s;ilk, wool, and iron, would be &s;muggled into Spain, the high price there being &s;ufficient to overbalance every ri&s;k: Spain would be left with|out indu&s;try, and without people. Spain was ac|tually in the flouri&s;hing &s;tate here &s;uppo&s;ed when America was di&s;covered: its gold and &s;ilver mines enflamed the di&s;ea&s;e; and con&s;equently was the greate&s;t misfortune that ever befel that once po|tent kingdom. The exportation of our &s;ilver coin to the Ea&s;t Indies, &s;o loudly exclaimed again&s;t by &s;hallow politicians, is to us, on the contrary, a mo&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="100">
&s;ub&s;tantial benefit; it keeps up the value of &s;ilver, and con&s;equently le&s;&s;ens the value of labour and of goods, which enables us to maintain our place in foreign markets. Were there no drain for our &s;il|ver, its quantity in our continent would &s;ink its va|lue &s;o much as to render the American mines unpro|fitable. Notwith&s;tanding the great flow of money to the Ea&s;t Indies, many mines in the We&s;t Indies are given up, becau&s;e they afford not the expence of working; and were the value of &s;ilver in Eu|rope brought much lower, the whole &s;ilver mines in the We&s;t Indies would be nece&s;&s;arily abandoned. Thus our Ea&s;t India commerce, which is thought ruinous by many, becau&s;e it is a drain to much of our &s;ilver, is for that very rea&s;on profitable to all. The Spaniards profit by importing it into Europe; and other nations profit, by receiving it for their manufactures.</P>
<P>How ignorantly do people &s;truggle again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ary connection of cau&s;es and effects! If money do not overflow, a commerce in which the imports exceed in value the exports, will &s;oon drain a nation of its money, and put an end to in|du&s;try. Commercial nations for that rea&s;on &s;truggle hard for a favourable balance of trade; and they fondly imagine that it cannot be too favourable. If advantageous to them, it mu&s;t be di&s;advantageous to tho&s;e they deal with; which proves equally ruinous to both. They fore&s;ee, indeed, but with|out concern, immediate ruin to tho&s;e they deal with; but they have no inclination to &s;ore&s;ee, that ultimately it will prove equally ruinous to them&s;elves. It appears the intention of Providence, that all nations &s;hould benefit by commerce as by &s;un&s;hine; and it is &s;o ordered, that an unequal balance is pre|judicial to the gainers as well as to the lo&s;ers: the latter are immediate &s;ufferers; but not le&s;s &s;o ulti|mately are the former. This is one remarkable in|&s;tance,
<PB N="89" REF="101">
among many, of providential wi&s;dom in conducting human affairs, independent of the will of man, and frequently again&s;t his will. An am|bitious nation, placed advantageou&s;ly for trade, would willingly engro&s;s all to them&s;elves, and re|duce their neighbours to be hewers of wood and drawers of water. But an invincible bar is op|po&s;ed to &s;uch avarice, making an overgrown com|merce the means of its own de&s;truction. The commercial balance held by the hand of Provi|dence, is never permitted to preponderate much to one &s;ide; and every nation partakes, or may par|take, of all the comforts of life. Engro&s;&s;ing is bad policy; and men are prompted, both by in|tere&s;t and duty, to &s;econd the plan of Providence, and to pre&s;erve, as near as po&s;&s;ible, equality in the balance of trade.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e principles, a wi&s;e people, having acquired a &s;tock of money &s;ufficient for an exten|&s;ive commerce, will tremble at a balance too ad|vantageous: they will re&s;t &s;atisfied with an equal balance, which is the golden mean. A di&s;advan|tageous balance may always be prevented by indu&s;try and frugality: but by what means is a ba|lance too favourable to be guarded again&s;t? With re&s;pect to that que&s;tion, it is not the quantity &s;ingly of gold and &s;ilver in a country that rai&s;es the price of labour and of manufactures, but the quantity in circulation; and may not the circulating quan|tity be regulated by the &s;tate, permitting no coin|age but what is beneficial to its manufactures? Let the regi&s;ters of foreign mints be carefully watched, in order that our current coin may not exceed that of our indu&s;trious neighbours. There will always be a demand for the &s;urplus of our bullion, either to be exported as a commodity, or to be purcha&s;ed at home for plate: which can|not be too much encouraged, being ready at every
<PB N="90" REF="102">
cri&s;is to be coined for public &s;ervice. The &s;enate of Genoa has wi&s;ely burdened porcelane with a heavy tax, being a foreign luxury; but it has not le&s;s wi&s;ely left gold and &s;ilver plate free; whil&s;t we mo&s;t unwi&s;ely have loaded it with a duty.</P>
<P>The accumulating of money in a public trea|&s;ury, anciently the practice of every prudent mo|narch, prevents &s;uperfluity. Lies there any good objection again&s;t that practice, in a trading na|tion, where gold and &s;ilver flow in with impetu|o&s;ity? A great &s;um locked up by a frugal king, Henry VII. of England for example, le&s;&s;ens the quantity of money in circulation: profu&s;ion in a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, which was the ca&s;e of Henry VIII. is a &s;pur to indu&s;try, &s;imilar to the influx of gold and &s;ilver from the new world. The canton of Bern, by locking up money in its trea&s;ury, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the miraculous art of reconciling immen&s;e wealth with frugality and cheap labour. A climate not kindly, and a &s;oil not naturally fertile, enured the inhabitants to temperance and to virtue. Pa|trioti&s;m is their ruling pa&s;&s;ion: they con&s;ider them|&s;elves as children of the republic; are fond of &s;er|ving their mother; and hold them&s;elves &s;ufficiently recompen&s;ed by the privilege of &s;erving her; by which means the public revenue greatly exceeds the expence of government. They carefully lock up the &s;urplus for purcha&s;ing land when a proper opportunity offers; which is a &s;hining proof of their di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s as well as of their wi&s;dom. By that politic mea&s;ure, much more than by war, the canton of Bern, from a very &s;lender origin, is now far &s;uperior to any of the other cantons in ex|tent of territory. But in what other part of the globe are there to be found mini&s;ters of &s;tate, mo|derate and di&s;intere&s;ted like the citizens of Bern! In the hands of a rapacious mini&s;try, the greate&s;t trea&s;ure would not be long-lived: under the ma|nagement
<PB N="91" REF="103">
of a Briti&s;h mini&s;try, it would vani&s;h in the twinkling of an eye; and do more mi&s;chief by augmenting our money in circulation above what is &s;alutary, than formerly it did good by con|fining it within moderate bounds. But again&s;t &s;uch a mea&s;ure there lies an objection &s;till more weighty than its being an ineffectual remedy: in the hands of an ambitious prince it would prove dangerous to liberty.</P>
<P>If the foregoing mea&s;ures be not reli&s;hed, I can di&s;cover no other means for pre&s;erving our &s;tation in foreign markets, but a bounty on ex|portation. The &s;um would be great: but the pre|&s;erving our indu&s;try and manufactures, and the preventing an influx of foreign manufactures, are con&s;picuous advantages that cannot be purcha&s;ed too dear. At the &s;ame time, a bounty on ex|portation would not be an in&s;upportable load: on the contrary, &s;uperfluity of wealth, procured by a balance con&s;tantly favourable, would make the load abundantly ea&s;y. A proper bounty would ba|lance the growing price of labour and materials at home, and keep open the foreign market. By neglecting that &s;alutary mea&s;ure, the Dutch have lo&s;t all their manufactures, a neglect that has greatly benefited both England and France. The Dutch indeed act prudently in with-holding that benefit as much as po&s;&s;ible from their powerful neighbours: to prevent purcha&s;ing from them, they con&s;ume the manufactures of India.</P>
<P>The manufactures of Spain, once exten&s;ive, have been extirpated, partly by their mines of gold and &s;ilver. Authors a&s;cribe to the &s;ame cau&s;e the decline of their agriculture; but erroneou&s;ly: on the contrary, &s;uperfluity of gold and &s;ilver is favourable to agriculture, by rai&s;ing the price of its productions. It rai&s;es al&s;o, it is true, the price of labour; but that additional expence is far from
<PB N="92" REF="104">
balancing the profit made by high prices of what|ever is rai&s;ed out of the ground. Too much wealth indeed is apt to make the farmer pre&s;s into a higher rank: but it is the landlord's fault if that evil be not prevented by a proper heightening of the rent, which will always confine the farmer within his own &s;phere.</P>
<P>As gold and &s;ilver are e&s;&s;ential to commerce, foreign and dome&s;tic, &s;everal commercial nations, fond of the&s;e precious metals, have endeavoured mo&s;t ab&s;urdly to bar the exportation by penal laws; forgetting that gold and &s;ilver will never be exported while the balance of trade is in their favour, and that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be export|ed when the balance is again&s;t them. Neither do they con&s;ider, that if a people continue indu&s;trious, they cannot be long afflicted with an unfavourable balance; for the value of money, ri&s;ing in pro|portion to its &s;carcity, will lower the price of their manufactures, and promote exportation: the ba|lance will turn in their favour; and money will flow in, till by plenty its value be reduced to a par with that of neighbouring nations.</P>
<P>It is an important que&s;tion, Whether a bank be upon the whole beneficial or hurtful to commerce. It is undoubtedly a &s;pur to indu&s;try, like a new in|flux of money: but then, like &s;uch influx, it rai&s;es the price of labour and of manufactures. Weighing the&s;e two facts in a ju&s;t balance, the re&s;ult &s;eems to be, that in a country where mo|ney is &s;carce, a bank properly con&s;tituted is a great ble&s;&s;ing, as it in effect multiplies the &s;pecie, and promotes indu&s;try and manufactures; but that in a country which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es money &s;ufficient for an exten&s;ive trade, the only bank that will not hurt foreign commerce, is that which is erected for &s;up|plying the merchant with ready money by di&s;|counting bills. At the &s;ame time, much caution
<PB N="93" REF="105">
and circum&s;pection is nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to banks of both kinds. A bank erected for di&s;count|ing bills, ought to be confined to bills really granted in the cour&s;e of commerce; and ought to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the being impo&s;ed on by fictitious bills drawn merely in order to procure a loan of money. And with re&s;pect to a bank purpo&s;ely erected for lending money, there is great danger of extending credit too far, not only with re&s;pect to the bank it&s;elf and to its numerous debtors, but with re&s;pect to the country in general, by rai&s;ing the price of labour and of manufactures, which is the never-failing re&s;ult of too great plenty of mo|ney, whether coin or paper.</P>
<P>The different effects of plenty and &s;carcity of money, have not e&s;caped that penetrating genius, the &s;overeign of Pru&s;&s;ia. Money is not &s;o plenti|ful in his dominions as to make it nece&s;&s;ary to with|draw a quantity, by heaping up trea&s;ure. He in|deed always retains in his trea&s;ury &s;ix or &s;even mil|lions Sterling for an&s;wering unfore&s;een demands: but being &s;en&s;ible that the withdrawing from circu|lation any larger &s;um, would be prejudicial to com|merce, every farthing &s;aved from the nece&s;&s;ary ex|pence of government, is laid out upon buildings, upon operas, upon any thing, rather than cramp circulation. In that kingdom, a bank e&s;tabli&s;hed for lending money would promote indu&s;try and manufactures.</P>

<HEAD>USEFUL ARTS.</HEAD>
<P>SOME u&s;eful arts mu&s;t be nearly coeval with the human race; for food, cloathing, and ha|bitation, even in their original &s;implicity, require &s;ome art. Many other arts are of &s;uch antiquity as to place the inventors beyond the reach of tra|dition. Several have gradually crept into exi&s;tence, without an inventor. The bu&s;y mind, however, accu&s;tomed to a beginning in things, cannot re&s;t till it finds or imagines a beginning to every art. Bac|chus is &s;aid to have invented wine; and Staphylus, the mixing water with wine. The bow and arrow are a&s;cribed by tradition to Scythos, &s;on of Jupiter, tho' a weapon all the world over. Spinning is &s;o u&s;eful, that it mu&s;t be honoured with &s;ome illu&s;tri|ous inventor: it was a&s;cribed by the Egyptians to their godde&s;s I&s;is; by the Greeks to Minerva; by the Peruvians to Mama Ella, wife to their fir&s;t &s;o|vereign Mango Capac; and by the Chine&s;e to the wife of their Emperor Yao. Mark here by the way, a connection of ideas: &s;pinning is a female occupation, and it mu&s;t have had a female in|ventor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Illinois are indu&s;trious above all their Ameri|can neighbours. Their women are neat-handed: they &s;pin the wool of their horned cattle, which is as fine as that of the Engli&s;h &s;heep. The &s;tuffs made of it are dyed black, yellow, or red, and cut into garments &s;ewed with roe-buck &s;inews. After drying the&s;e &s;inews in the &s;un, and beating them, they draw out threads as white and fine as any that are made of flax, but much tougher.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="107">
In the hunter-&s;tate, men are wholly occupied in procuring food, cloathing, habitation, and other nece&s;&s;aries; and have no time nor zeal for &s;tudying conveniencies. The ea&s;e of the &s;hepherd-&s;tate af|fords both time and inclination for u&s;eful arts; which are greatly promoted by numbers who are relieved by agriculture from bodily labour: the &s;oil, by gradual improvements in hu&s;bandry, affords plenty, with le&s;s labour than at fir&s;t; and the &s;ur|plus hands are employed, fir&s;t, in u&s;eful arts, and, next, in tho&s;e of amu&s;ement. Arts accordingly make the quicke&s;t progre&s;s in a fertile &s;oil, which produces plenty with little labour. Arts flouri&s;h|ed early in Egypt and Chaldea, countries extremely fertile.</P>
<P>When men, who originally lived in caves like &s;ome wild animals, began to think of a more commodious habitation, their fir&s;t hou&s;es were ex|tremely &s;imple; witne&s;s the hou&s;es of the Canadian &s;avages, which continue &s;o to this day. Their hou&s;es, &s;ays Charlevoix, are built with le&s;s art, neatne&s;s, and &s;olidity, than tho&s;e of the beavers; having neither chimnies nor windows: a hole only is left in the roof, for admitting light, and emitting &s;moke. That hole mu&s;t be &s;topped when it rains or &s;nows; and of cour&s;e the fire mu&s;t be put out, that the inhabitants may not be blinded with &s;moke. To have pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many ages in that man|ner, without thinking of any improvement, &s;hows how greatly men are influenced by cu&s;tom. The blacks of Jamaica are &s;till more rude in their build|ings: their huts are erected without even a hole in
<PB N="96" REF="108">
the roof; and accordingly at home they breathe no|thing but &s;moke.</P>
<P>Revenge early produced ho&s;tile weapons. The club and the dart are obvious inventions: not &s;o the bow and arrow; and for that rea&s;on it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay how that weapon came to be univer&s;al. As iron is &s;eldom found in a mine like other metals, it was a late di&s;covery: at the &s;iege of Troy, &s;pears, darts, and arrows, were headed with bra&s;s. Mene&s;theus, who &s;ucceeded The&s;eus in the king|dom of Athens, and led fifty &s;hips to the &s;iege of Troy, was reputed the fir&s;t who mar&s;halled an army in battle-array. In&s;truments of defence are made nece&s;&s;ary by tho&s;e of offence. Trunks of trees, interlaced with branches, and &s;upported with earth, made the fir&s;t fortifications; to which &s;uc|ceeded a wall fini&s;hed with a parapet for &s;hooting arrows at be&s;iegers. As a parapet covers but half of the body, holes were left in the wall from &s;pace to &s;pace, no larger than to give pa&s;&s;age to an ar|row. Be&s;iegers had no remedy but to beat down the wall: a battering-ram was fir&s;t u&s;ed by Pericles the Athenian, and perfected by the Carthaginians at the &s;iege of Gades. To oppo&s;e that formidable machine, the wall was built with advanced pa|rapets for throwing &s;tones and fire upon the ene|my, which kept him at a di&s;tance. A wooden booth upon wheels, and pu&s;hed clo&s;e to the wall, &s;ecured the men who wrought the battering-ram. This invention was rendered ineffectual, by &s;ur|rounding the wall with a deep and broad ditch. Be&s;iegers were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of invent|ing engines for throwing &s;tones and javelins upon tho&s;e who occupied the advanced parapets, in order to give opportunity for filling up the ditch; and ancient hi&s;tories expatiate upon the powerful oper|ation of the catapulta and bali&s;ta. The&s;e engines &s;ugge&s;ted a new invention for defence: in&s;tead of a
<PB N="97" REF="109">
circular wall, it was built with &s;alient angles, like the teeth of a &s;aw, in order that one part might flank another. That form of a wall was after|ward improved, by rai&s;ing round towers upon the &s;alient angles; and the towers were improved by making them &s;quare. The ancients had no occa|&s;ion for any form more complete, being &s;ufficient for defending again&s;t all the mi&s;&s;ile weapons at that time known. The invention of cannon required a variation in military architecture. The fir&s;t can|nons were made of iron bars, forming a concave cylinder, united by rings of copper. The fir&s;t can|non-balls were of &s;tone, which required a very large aperture. A cannon was reduced to a &s;maller &s;ize, by u&s;ing iron for balls in&s;tead of &s;tone; and that de&s;tructive engine was perfected by making it of ca&s;t metal. To re&s;i&s;t its force, ba&s;tions were in|vented, horn-works, crown-works, half-moons, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and military architecture became a &s;y&s;tem, governed by fundamental principles and general rules. But all in vain: it has indeed pro|duced fortifications that have made &s;ieges horridly bloody; but artillery at the &s;ame time has been carried to &s;uch perfection, and the art of attack &s;o improved, that, according to the general opinion, no fortification can be rendered impregnable. The only impregnable defence is, good neigh|bourhood among weak princes, ready to unite whenever one of them is attacked with &s;uperior force. And nothing tends more effectually to pro|mote &s;uch union, than con&s;tant experience that fortifications ought not to be relied on.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to naval architecture, the fir&s;t ve&s;|&s;els were beams joined together, and covered with planks, pu&s;hed along with long poles in &s;hallow water, and drawn by animals in deep water. To the&s;e &s;ucceeded trunks of trees cut hollow, termed by the Greeks MONOXYLES. The next we e
<PB N="98" REF="110">
planks joined together in form of a monoxyle. The thought of imitating a fi&s;h advanced naval archi|tecture. A prow was con&s;tructed in imitation of the head, a &s;tern with a moveable helm, in imi|tation of the tail, and oars in imitation of the fins. Sails were at la&s;t added; which invention was &s;o early, that the contriver is unknown. Before the year 1545, &s;hips of war in England had no port|holes for guns, as at pre&s;ent: they had only a few cannon placed on the upper deck.</P>
<P>When Homer compo&s;ed his poems, at lea&s;t during the Trojan war, the Greeks had not ac|quired the art of gelding cattle; they ate the fle&s;h of bulls and of rams. Kings and princes killed and cooked their victuals: &s;poons, forks, table|cloths, napkins, were unknown. They fed &s;itting, the cu&s;tom of reclining upon beds being afterward copied from A&s;ia; and, like other &s;avages, they were great eaters. At the time mentioned, they had not chimnies, nor candles, nor lamps. Torches are frequently mentioned by Homer, but lamps never: a va&s;e was placed upon a tripod, in which was burnt dry wood for giving light. Locks and keys were not common at that time. Bundles were &s;ecured with ropes intricately combined<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ody&s;&s;ey, b. 8. l. 483. Pope's tran&s;lation.</NOTE>; and hence the famous Gordian knot. Shoes and &s;tock|ings were not early known among them, nor but|tons, nor &s;addles, nor &s;tirrups. Plutarch reports, that Gracchus cau&s;ed &s;tones to be erected along the high-ways leading from Rome, for the convenience of mounting a hor&s;e; for at that time &s;tirrups were unknown, though an obvious invention. Linnen for &s;hirts was not u&s;ed in Rome for many years after the government became de&s;potic. Even &s;o late as the eighth century, it was not common in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="111">
Thales, one of the &s;even wi&s;e men of Greece, about &s;ix hundred years before Chri&s;t, invented the following method for mea&s;uring the height of an Egyptian pyramid. He watched the progre&s;s of the &s;un, till his body and the &s;hadow were of the &s;ame length; and at that in&s;tant mea&s;ured the &s;hadow of the pyramid, which con&s;equently gave its height. Ama&s;is, king of Egypt, pre&s;ent at the operation, thought it a wonderful effort of genius; and the Greeks admired it highly. Geometry mu&s;t have been in its very cradle at that time. Anaximander, &s;ome ages before Chri&s;t, made the fir&s;t map of the earth, &s;o far as then known. About the end of the thirteenth century, &s;pectacles for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the &s;ight were invented by Alexander Spina, a monk of Pi&s;a. So u&s;eful an invention cannot be too much extolled. At a period of life when the judgement is in maturity, and reading is of great benefit, the eyes begin to grow dim. One cannot help pitying the condition of booki&s;h men before that invention; many of whom mu&s;t have had their &s;ight greatly impaired, while their appe|tite for reading was in vigour.</P>
<P>As the origin and progre&s;s of writing make a ca|pital article in the pre&s;ent &s;ketch, they mu&s;t not be overlooked. To write, or, in other words, to ex|hibit thoughts to the eye, was early attempted in Egypt by hieroglyphics. But the&s;e were not con|fined to Egypt: figures, compo&s;ed of painted fea|thers, were u&s;ed in Mexico to expre&s;s ideas; and by &s;uch figures Montezuma received intelli|gence of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion: in Peru, the only arithmetical figures known were knots of various colours, which &s;erved to ca&s;t up accounts. The &s;econd &s;tep naturally in the art of writing, is, to repre&s;ent each word by a mark, termed a letter, which is the Chine&s;e way of writing: they have about 11,000 of then marks or letters in common
<PB N="100" REF="112">
u&s;e; and in matters of &s;cience, they employ to the number of 60,000. Our way is far more ea&s;y and commodious: in&s;tead of marks or letters for words, which are infinite, we repre&s;ent by marks or letters, the articulate &s;ounds that compo&s;e words: the&s;e &s;ounds exceed not thirty in number; and con&s;e|quently the &s;ame number of marks or letters are &s;ufficient for writing. This was at once to &s;tep from hieroglyphics, the mo&s;t imperfect mode of writing, to letters repe&s;enting &s;ounds, the mo&s;t perfect; for there is no probability that the Chine&s;e mode was ever practi&s;ed in this part of the world. With us, the learning to read is &s;o ea&s;y as to be acquired in childhood; and we are ready for the &s;ciences as &s;oon as the mind is ripe for them: the Chine&s;e mode, on the contrary, is an un&s;urmount|able ob&s;truction to knowledge; becau&s;e it being the work of a life-time to read with ea&s;e, no time re|mains for &s;tudying the &s;ciences. Our ca&s;e was in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;ame at the re&s;toration of learn|ing: it required an age to be familiarized with the Greek and Latin tongues; and too little time re|mained for gathering knowledge out of their books. The Chine&s;e &s;tand upon a more equal footing with re&s;pect to arts; for the&s;e may be acquired by imi|tation or oral in&s;truction, without books.</P>
<P>The art of writing with letters repre&s;enting &s;ounds, is, of all inventions, the mo&s;t important, and the lea&s;t obvious. The way of writing in China makes &s;o naturally the &s;econd &s;tep in the progre&s;s of the art, that our good fortune in &s;tumbling upon a way &s;o much more perfect cannot be &s;uffici|ently admired, when to it we are indebted for our &s;uperiority in literature above the Chine&s;e. Their way of writing is a fatal ob&s;truction to &s;cience; for it is &s;o rivetted by inveterate practice, that the difficulty would not be greater to make them change their language, than their letters. Hiero|glyphics
<PB N="101" REF="113">
were a &s;ort of writing, &s;o mi&s;erably im|perfect, as to make every improvement welcome; but as the Chine&s;e make a tolerable &s;hift with their own letters, however cumber&s;ome to tho&s;e who know better, they never dream of any improve|ment. Hence it may be averred, with great cer|tainty, that in China, the &s;ciences, though &s;till in infancy, will for ever continue &s;o.</P>
<P>The art of writing was known in Greece when Homer compo&s;ed his two epics; for he gives &s;ome|where a hint of it. It was at that time probably in its infancy, and u&s;ed only for recording laws, re|ligious precepts, or other &s;hort works. Cyphers, invented in Hindo&s;tan, were brought into France from Arabia, about the end of the tenth century.</P>
<P>Hu&s;bandry made a progre&s;s from Egypt to Greece, and from Afric to Italy. Mago, a Car|thaginian general, compo&s;ed twenty-eight books upon hu&s;bandry, which were tran&s;lated into Latin by order of the Roman &s;enate. From the&s;e fine and fertile countries, it made its way to colder and le&s;s kindly climates. According to that progre&s;s, agriculture mu&s;t have been practi&s;ed more early in France than in Britain; and yet the Engli&s;h at pre&s;ent make a greater figure in that art than the French, inferiority in &s;oil and climate notwith|&s;tanding. Before hu&s;bandry became an art in the northern parts of Europe, the French noble&s;&s;e had de&s;erted the country, fond of &s;ociety in a town-life. Landed gentlemen in England, more rough, and delighting more in hunting and other country amu&s;ements, found lei&s;ure to practi&s;e agriculture. Skill in that art proceeded from them to their tenants, who now pro&s;ecute hu&s;bandry with &s;uc|ce&s;s, though their landlords have generally betaken them&s;elves to a town-life.</P>
<P>When Cae&s;ar invaded Britain, agriculture was unknown in the inner parts: the inhabitants fed
<PB N="102" REF="114">
upon milk and fle&s;h, and were cloathed with &s;kins. Hollin&s;hed, cotemporary with Elizabeth of Eng|land, de&s;cribes the rudene&s;s of the preceding ge|neration in the arts of life: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There were very few chimnies, even in capital towns: the fire was laid to the wall, and the &s;moke i&s;&s;ued out at the roof, or door, or window. The hou&s;es were wattled and plai&s;tered over with clay; and all the furniture and uten&s;ils were of wood. The people &s;lept on &s;traw-pallets, with a log of wood for a pillow."</Q> Henry II. of France, at the marriage of the Duche&s;s of Savoy, wore the fir&s;t &s;ilk &s;tockings that were made in France. Queen Elizabeth, the third year of her reign, received in a pre&s;ent a pair of black &s;ilk knit &s;tockings; and Dr. Howel reports, that &s;he never wore cloth ho&s;e any more. Before the conque&s;t there was a timber bridge upon the Thames between London and Southwark, which was repaired by King Wil|liam Rufus, and was burnt by accident in the reign of Henry II. ann. 1176. At that time a &s;tone bridge in place of it was projected, but it was not fini&s;hed till the year 1212. The bridge Notre-Dame over the Seine in Paris was fir&s;t of Wood. It fell down anno 1499; and as there was not in France a man who would undertake to rebuild it of &s;tone, an Italian cordelier was employed, who&s;e name was Joconde, the &s;ame upon whom Sanazarius made the following pun:
<Q><L>Jocondus geminum impo&s;uit tibi, Sequana, pontem;</L>

The art of making gla&s;s was imported from France into England, ann. 674, for the u&s;e of mona&s;teries. Gla&s;s windows in private hou&s;es were rare, even in the twelfth century, and held to be great luxury. King Edward III. invited three clockmakers of

Del&s;t in Holland to &s;ettle in England. In the former part of the reign of Henry VIII. there did not grow in England cabbage, carrot, turnip, or other edible root; and it has been noted, that even Queen Catharine her&s;elf could not command a &s;al|lad for dinner, till the King brought over a gar|dener from the Netherlands. About the &s;ame time, the artichoke, the apricot, the dama&s;k ro&s;e, made their fir&s;t apearance in England. Turkeys, carps, and hops, were fir&s;t known there in the year 1524. The currant-&s;hrub was brought from the i&s;land of Zant, ann. 1533, and in the year 1540, cher|ry-trees from Flanders were fir&s;t planted in Kent. It was in the year 1563 that knives were fir&s;t made in England. Pocket-watches were brought there from Germany, ann. 1577. About the year 1580, coaches were introduced; before which time Queen Elizabeth, on public occa&s;ions, rode behind her chamberlain. A &s;aw-mill was erected near London, ann. 1633, but afterwards demoli&s;hed, that it might not deprive the labouring poor of em|ployment.

<P>People who are ignorant of weights and mea|&s;ures fall upon odd &s;hifts to &s;upply the defect. Howel Dha Prince of Wales, who died in the year 948, was their capital lawgiver.

The negroes of the kingdom of Ardrah in Gui|nea have made great advances in arts. Their towns, for the mo&s;t part, are fortified, and con|nected by great roads, kept in good repair. Deep canals from river to river are commonly filled with canoes, for plea&s;ure &s;ome, and many for bu&s;ine&s;s. The vallies are plea&s;ant, producing wheat, millet, yams, potatoes, lemons, oranges, cocoa-nuts, and dates. The mar&s;hy grounds near the &s;ea are drain|ed; and &s;alt is made by evaporating the &s;tagnating water.

<P>In all countries where the people are barbarous and illiterate, the progre&s;s of arts is wofully &s;low. It is vouched by an old French poem, that the vir|tues of the load&s;tone were known in France before ann. 1180. The mariner's compa&s;s was exhibited at Venice ann. 1260 by Paulus Venetus, as his own invention. John Goya of Amalphi was the fir&s;t who, many years afterward, u&s;ed it in navigation; and al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed for being the inventor. Tho' it was u&s;ed in China for navigation long before it was known in Europe, yet to this day it is not &s;o perfect as in Europe. In&s;tead of &s;u&s;pending it in order to make it act freely, it is placed upon a bed of &s;and, by which every motion of the &s;hip di&s;turbs its operation. Hand-mills, termed querns, were early u&s;ed for grinding corn; and when corn came to be rai&s;ed in greater quantity, hor&s;e-mills &s;ucceeded.

The ancients had mirror-gla&s;&s;es, and employ'd gla&s;s to imitate cry&s;tal va&s;es and goblets: yet they never thought of u&s;ing it in windows. In the thirteenth century, the Venetians were the only prople who had the art of making cry&s;tal gla&s;s for mirrors. A clock that &s;trikes the hours was un|known in Europe till the end of the twelfth cen|tury. And hence the cu&s;tom of employing men to proclaim the hours during night; which to this day continues in Germany, Flanders, and Eng|land. Galileo was the fir&s;t who conceived an idea that a pendulum might be u&s;eful for mea&s;uring time; and Hughens was the fir&s;t who put the idea in execution, by making a pendulum clock. Hook, in the year 1660, invented a &s;piral &s;pring for a watch, tho' a watch was far from being a new invention. Paper was made no earlier than the fourteenth century; and the invention of printing was a century later. Silk manufactures were long e&s;tabli&s;hed in Greece before &s;ilk-worms were intro|duced there. The manufacturers were provided with raw &s;ilk from Per&s;ia: but that commerce be|ing frequently interrupted by war, two monks, in the reign of Ju&s;tinian, brought eggs of the &s;ilk-worm from Hindo&s;tan, and taught their country|men the method of managing them. The art of reading made a very &s;low progre&s;s. To encourage that art in England, the capital puni&s;hment for murder was remitted if the criminal could but read, which in law-language is termed benefit of clergy.

<P>The exertion of national &s;pirit upon any parti|cular art, promotes activity to pro&s;ecute other arts.

Having, in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, acquired &s;ome degree of ta&s;te and poli&s;h, a talent for writing broke forth.

<P>The progre&s;s of art &s;eldom fails to be rapid, when a people happen to be rou&s;ed out of a torpid &s;tate by &s;ome fortunate change of circum&s;tances: pro&s;|perity contra&s;ted with former aba&s;ement, gives to the mind a &s;pring, which is vigorou&s;ly exerted in every new pur&s;uit. The Athenians made but a mean figure under the tyranny of Pi&s;i&s;tratus; but upon regaining freedom and independence, they were converted into heroes. Miletus, a Greek city of Ionia, being de&s;troy'd by the King of Per&s;ia, and the inhabitants made &s;laves; the Athenians, deeply affected with the mi&s;ery of their brethren, boldly attacked that king in his own dominions, and burnt the city of Sardis. In le&s;s than ten years after, they gained a &s;ignal victory at Marathon; and under Themi&s;tocles, made head again&s;t that prodigious army with which Xerxes threatened utter ruin to Greece. Such pro&s;perity produced its u&s;ual effect: arts flouri&s;hed with arms, and Athens became the chief theatre for &s;ciences as well as for fine arts. The reign of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, which put an end to the rancour of civil war, and re&s;tored peace to Rome with the comforts of &s;ociety, proved an au&s;|picious aera for literature; and produced a cloud of Latin hi&s;torians, poets, and philo&s;ophers, to whom the moderns are indebted for their ta&s;te and talents. One who makes a figure rou&s;es emulation in all: one catches fire from another, and the national &s;pirit is every where triumphant: cla&s;&s;ical works are compo&s;ed, and u&s;eful di&s;coveries made in every art and &s;cience. This fairly accounts for the fol|lowing ob&s;ervation of Velleius Paterculus<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toria Romana, lib. 1. in fine.</NOTE>, that

The philo&s;ophic &s;ages of the Socratic &s;chool appeared all about the time of Plato and Ari&s;totle. And as to rhetoric, few excelled in that art before I&s;ocrates, and as few after the &s;econd defcent of his &s;cholars."</Q> The hi&s;torian applies the &s;ame ob&s;ervation to the Romans, and extends it even to grammarians, painters, &s;tatuaries, and &s;culptors. With regard to Rome, it is true, that the Roman government under Augu&s;tus was in effect de&s;potic: but de&s;poti&s;m, in that &s;ingle in&s;tance, made no ob|&s;truction to literature, it having been the politic of that reign to hide power as much as po&s;&s;ible. A &s;imilar revolution happened in Tu&s;cany about three centuries ago. That country having been divided into a number of &s;mall republics, the people, excited by mutual hatred between &s;mall nations in clo&s;e neighbourhood, became ferocious and bloody, flaming with revenge for the &s;lighte&s;t offence. The&s;e republics being united under the Great Duke of Tu&s;cany, enjoy'd the &s;weets of peace in a mild government. That comfortable revolution, which made the deeper impre&s;&s;ion by a retro&s;pect to recent calamities, rou&s;ed the national &s;pirit, and produced ardent application to arts and literature. The re|&s;toration of the royal family in England, which put an end to a cruel and envenomed civil war, promot|ed improvements of every kind: arts and indu&s;try made a rapid progre&s;s among the people, tho' left to them&s;elves by a weak and fluctuating admini&s;tra|tion.
<PB N="110" REF="122">
Had the nation, upon that favourable turn of fortune, been ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of able and virtuous princes, to what a height might not arts and &s;ciences have been carried! In Scotland, a fa|vourable period for improvements was the reign of the fir&s;t Robert, after &s;haking off the Engli&s;h yoke: but the domineering &s;pirit of the feudal &s;y&s;tem ren|dered abortive every attempt. The re&s;toration of the royal family, mentioned above, animated the legi&s;lature of Scotland to promote manufactures of various kinds: but in vain; for the union of the two crowns had introduced de&s;poti&s;m into Scotland, which &s;unk the genius of the people, and rendered them heartle&s;s and indolent. Liberty, indeed, and many other advantages, were procured to them by the union of the two kingdoms; but the&s;e &s;alutary effects were long &s;u&s;pended by mutual enmity, &s;uch as commonly &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between neighbouring nations. Enmity wore out gradually, and the eyes of the Scots were opened to the advantages of their pre|&s;ent condition: the national &s;pirit was rou&s;ed to emulate and to excel: talents were exerted, hither|to latent; and Scotland at pre&s;ent makes a figure in arts and &s;ciences, above what it ever made while an independent kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Scotland, an innocent bankrupt impri&s;oned for debt, obtains liberty by a proce&s;s termed Ce&s;&s;io bonorum. From the year 1694 to 1744 there were but twenty-four proce&s;&s;es of that kind; which &s;hows how languidly trade was carried on while the people remained &s;till ig|norant of their advantages by the union. From that time to the year 1771 there have been thrice that num|ber every year, taking one year with another; an evi|dent proof of the late rapid progre&s;s of commerce in Scotland. Every one is rou&s;ed to venture his &s;mall &s;tock, tho' every one cannot be &s;ucce&s;sful.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e of activity and animation, is the being engaged in &s;ome important action of doubtful
<PB N="111" REF="123">
event, a &s;truggle for liberty, the re&s;i&s;ting a potent invader, or the like. Greece, divided into &s;mall &s;tates frequently at war with each other, advanced literature and the fine arts to unrivalled per&s;ection. The Cor&s;icans, while engaged in a perilous war for defence of their liberties, exerted a vigorous na|tional &s;pirit: they founded an univer&s;ity for arts and &s;ciences, a public library, and a public bank. After a long &s;tupor during the dark ages of Chri&s;|tianity, arts and literature revived among the tur|bulent &s;tates of Italy. The royal &s;ociety in London, and the academy of &s;ciences in Paris, were both of them in&s;tituted after civil wars that had animated the people, and rou&s;ed their activity.</P>
<P>An u&s;eful art is &s;eldom lo&s;t, becau&s;e it is in con|&s;tant practice. And yet, tho' many u&s;eful arts were in perfection during the reign of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, it is amazing how ignorant and &s;tupid men became, after the Roman empire was &s;hattered by northern barbarians: they degenerated into &s;avages. So ignorant were the Spani&s;h Chri&s;tians during the eighth and ninth centuries, that Alphon&s;us the Great, King of Leon, was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of employing Mahometan preceptors for educating his elde&s;t &s;on. Even Charlemagne could not &s;ign his name: nor was he &s;ingular in that re&s;pect, being kept in countenance by &s;everal neighbouring princes.</P>
<P>As the progre&s;s of arts and &s;ciences toward per|fection is greatly promoted by emulation, nothing is more fatal to an art or &s;cience than to remove that &s;pur, as where &s;ome extraordinary genius ap|pears who &s;oars above rival&s;hip. Mathematics &s;eem to be declining in Britain; the great Newton, having &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the ancients, has not left to the moderns even the fainte&s;t hope of equalling him; and what man will enter the li&s;ts who de&s;pairs of victory?</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="124">
In early times, the inventors of u&s;eful arts were remembered with fervent gratitude. Their hi&s;tory became fabulous by the many incredible exploits that were attributed to them. Diodorus Siculus mentions the Egyptian tradition of O&s;iris, that with a numerous army he traver&s;ed every inhabited part of the globe, in order to teach men the culture of wheat and of the vine. Be&s;ide the impracticability of &s;upporting a numerous army where hu&s;bandry is unknown, no army could enable O&s;iris to introduce wheat or wine among &s;tupid &s;avages who live by hunting and fi&s;hing, which probably was the ca&s;e, in that early period, of all the nations he vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>In a country thinly peopled, where even nece&s;&s;ary arts want hands, it is common to &s;ee one per&s;on exerci&s;ing more arts than one: in &s;everal parts of Scotland, one man &s;erves as a phy&s;ician, &s;urgeon, and apothecary. In a very populous country, even &s;imple arts are &s;plit into parts, and each part has an arti&s;t appropriated to it. In the large towns of ancient Egypt, a phy&s;ician was confined to a &s;ingle di&s;ea&s;e. In mechanic arts that method is excellent. As a hand confined to a &s;ingle operation becomes both expert and expeditious, a mechanic art is per|fected by having its different operations di&s;tributed among the greate&s;t number of hands: many hands are employ'd in making a watch; and a &s;till greater number in manufacturing a web of woollen cloth. Various arts or operations carried on by the &s;ame man, envigorate his mind, becau&s;e they exerci&s;e different faculties; and as he cannot be equally expert in every art or operation, he is frequently reduced to &s;upply want of &s;kill by thought and in|vention. Con&s;tant application, on the contrary, to a &s;ingle operation, confines the mind to a &s;ingle object, and excludes all thought and invention: in &s;uch a train of life, the operator becomes dull and &s;tupid, like a bea&s;t of barden. The difference is
<PB N="113" REF="125">
vi&s;ible in the manners of the people: in a country where, from want of hands, &s;everal occupations mu&s;t be carried on by the &s;ame per&s;on, the people are knowing and conver&s;able: in a populous coun|try where manufactures flouri&s;h, they are ignorant and un&s;ociable. The &s;ame effect is equally vi&s;ible in countries where an art or manufacture is con|fined to a certain cla&s;s of men. It is vi&s;ible in Hindo&s;tan, where the people are divided into ca&s;ts, which never mix even by marriage, and where every man follows his father's trade. The Dutch lint-boors are a &s;imilar in&s;tance: the &s;ame families carry on the trade from generation to generation; and are accordingly ignorant and bruti&s;h even be|yond other Dutch pea&s;ants. The inhabitants of Buckhaven, a &s;eaport in the county of Fife, were originally a colony of foreigners, invited hither to teach our people the art of fi&s;hing. They con|tinue fi&s;hers to this day, marry among them&s;elves, have little intercour&s;e with their neighbours, and are dull and &s;tupid to a proverb.</P>

<P>THE &s;en&s;e by which we perceive right and wrong in actions, is termed the moral &s;en&s;e: the &s;en&s;e by which we perceive beauty and defor|mity in objects, is termed ta&s;te.

<P>The moral &s;en&s;e is born with us; and &s;o is ta&s;te: yet both of them require much cultivation. Among &s;avages, the moral &s;en&s;e is faint and ob&s;cure; and ta&s;te &s;till more &s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some Iroquois, after &s;eeing all the beauties of Paris, admired nothing but the &s;treet De la Houchette, where they found a con&s;tant &s;upply of eatables.</NOTE>. Even in the mo&s;t enlightened ages, it requires in a judge both education and ex|perience to perceive accurately the various modifi|cations of right and wrong: and to acquire delicacy of ta&s;te, a man mu&s;t grow old in examining beauties and deformities. In Rome, abounding with pro|ductions of the fine arts, an illiterate &s;hopkeeper is a more correct judge of &s;tatues, of pictures, and of buildings, than the be&s;t-educated citizen of Lon|don<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. chap. 25.</NOTE>. Thus ta&s;te goes hand in hand with the moral &s;en&s;e in their progre&s;s toward maturity, and they ripen equally by the &s;ame &s;ort of culture. Want, a barren &s;oil, cramps the growth of both:
<PB N="115" REF="127">
&s;en&s;uality, a &s;oil too fat, corrupts both: the middle &s;tate, equally di&s;tant from di&s;piriting poverty and luxurious &s;en&s;uality, is the &s;oil in which both of them flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>As the fine arts are intimately connected with ta&s;te, it is impracticable, in tracing their progre&s;s, to &s;eparate them by accurate limits. I join, there|fore, the progre&s;s of the fine arts to that of ta&s;te, where the former depends entirely on the latter; and I handle &s;eparately the progre&s;s of the fine arts, where that progre&s;s is influenced by other circum|&s;tances be&s;ide ta&s;te.</P>
<P>During the infancy of ta&s;te, imagination is &s;uf|fered to roam, as in &s;leep without control. Wonder is the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;avages and of ru&s;tics; to rai&s;e which, nothing is nece&s;&s;ary but to invent giants and magicians, fairy-land and inchantment. The earlie&s;t exploits recorded of warlike nations, are giants mowing down whole armies, and little men overcoming giants; witne&s;s Joannes Magnus, Tor|feus, and other Scandinavian writers. Hence the ab&s;urd romances that delighted the world for ages; which are now fallen into contempt every where. Madame de la Fayette led the way to novels in the pre&s;ent mode. She was the fir&s;t who introduced &s;entiments in&s;tead of wonderful adventures, and amiable men in&s;tead of bloody heroes. In &s;ub&s;ti|tuting di&s;tre&s;&s;es to prodigies, &s;he made a di&s;covery that per&s;ons of ta&s;te and feeling are more attached by compa&s;&s;ion than by wonder.</P>
<P>When gigantic fictions were bani&s;hed, &s;ome re|maining ta&s;te for the wonderful encouraged gigantic &s;imiles, metaphors, and allegories. The Song of Solomon, and many other A&s;iatic compo&s;itions, afford examples without end of &s;uch figures; which are commonly attributed to force of imagination in a warm climate. But a more exten&s;ive view will &s;how this to be a mi&s;take. In every climate, hot

and cold, the figurative &s;tyle is carried to extrava|gance, during a certain period in the progre&s;s of writing; a &s;tyle that is reli&s;hed by all at fir&s;t, and continues to delight many till it yields to a ta&s;te po|li&s;hed by long experience. Even in the bitter cold country of Iceland, we are at no lo&s;s for examples. A rain-bow is termed Bridge of the Gods: gold, Tears of Frya: the earth is termed Daughter of Night, the ve&s;&s;el that floats upon Ages; and herbs and plants are her hair, or her fleece.

<P>The national progre&s;s of morality is &s;low: the national progre&s;s of ta&s;te is &s;till &s;lower. In propor|tion as a nation poli&s;hes, and improves in the arts of peace, ta&s;te ripens. The Chine&s;e had long en|joy'd a regular &s;y&s;tem of government, while the Europeans were comparatively in a chaos; and accordingly literary compo&s;itions in China were brought to perfection more early than in Europe. In their poetry they indulge no incredible fables, like tho&s;e of Ario&s;to or the Arabian Tales; but commonly &s;elect &s;uch as afford a good moral. Their novels, like tho&s;e of the mo&s;t approved kind among us, treat of misfortunes unfore&s;een, unexpected good luck, and per&s;ons finding out their real pa|rents. The Orphan of China, compo&s;ed in the fourteenth century, &s;urpa&s;&s;es far any European play in that early period. But good writing has made a more rapid progre&s;s with us; not from &s;u|periority of talents, but from the great labour the Chine&s;e mu&s;t undergo, in learning to read and write their own language. The Chine&s;e tragedy is, indeed, languid, and not &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting; which Voltaire a&s;cribes to want of genius. With

better rea&s;on he might have a&s;cribed it to the na|ture of their government, &s;o well contrived for pre&s;erving peace and order, as to afford few exam|ples of &s;urpri&s;ing events, and little opportunity for exerting manly talents.</P>
<P>A nation cannot acquire a ta&s;te for ridicule till it emerge out of the &s;avage &s;tate. Ridicule, however, is too rough for refined manners: Cicero di&s;covers in Plautus a happy talent for ridicule, and peculiar delicacy of wit; but Horace, who figured in the court of Augu&s;tus, eminent for delicacy of ta&s;te, declares again&s;t the low roughne&s;s of that author's raillery<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, chap. 2. part 2.</NOTE>. The high burle&s;que &s;tyle prevails com|monly in the period between barbarity and polite|ne&s;s, in which a ta&s;te &s;omewhat improved di&s;covers the ridicule of former manners. Rabelais in France and Butler in England are illu&s;trious examples. Dr. Swift is our late&s;t burle&s;que writer, and probably will be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Emulation among a multitude of &s;mall &s;tates in Greece, ripened ta&s;te, and promoted the fine arts. Ta&s;te, rou&s;ed by emulation, refines gradually; and is advanced toward perfection by a diligent &s;tudy of beautiful productions. Rome was indebted to Greece for that delicacy of ta&s;te which &s;hone dur|ing the reign of Augu&s;tus, e&s;pecially in literary compo&s;itions. But ta&s;te could not long flouri&s;h in a de&s;potic government: &s;o low had the Roman ta&s;te fallen in the reign of the Emperor Hadrian, that nothing would plea&s;e him but to &s;uppre&s;s Ho|mer, and in his place to in&s;tall a &s;illy Greek poet, named Antimachus.</P>

Mi&s;erably low mu&s;t ta&s;te have been in that period, when a childi&s;h play of words was reli&s;hed as a pro|per decoration for a &s;erious &s;olemnity. The famous golden bull of Germany, dige&s;ted anno 1356 by Bartolus, a celebrated lawyer, and intended for a ma&s;ter-piece of compo&s;ition, is replete with wild conceptions, without the lea&s;t regard to truth, pro|priety, or connection. It begins with an apo&s;tro|phe to Pride, to Satan, to Choler, and to Luxury: it a&s;&s;erts, that there mu&s;t be &s;even electors for op|po&s;ing the &s;even mortal &s;ins: The fall of the angels, terre&s;trial paradi&s;e, Pompey, and Cae&s;ar, are in|troduced; and it is &s;aid, that Germany is founded on the Trinity, and on the three theological virtues. What can be more puerile! A &s;ermon preached by the Bi&s;hop of Bitonto, at the opening of the coun|cil of Trent, excels in that manner of compo&s;ition. He proves, that a council is nece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e &s;everal councils have extirpated here&s;y, and depo&s;ed kings and emperors; becau&s;e the poets a&s;&s;emble councils of the gods; becau&s;e Mo&s;es writes, that at the creation of man and at confounding the lan|guage of the giants, God acted in the manner of a council; becau&s;e religion has three heads, doctrine, &s;acraments, and charity; and that the&s;e three are termed a council. He exhorts the members of the council to &s;trict unity, like the heroes in the Trojan hor&s;e. He a&s;&s;erts, that the gates of paradi&s;e and of the council are the &s;ame; that the holy fathers &s;hould &s;prinkle their dry hearts with the living wa|ter that flowed from it; and that otherwi&s;e the Holy Gho&s;t would open their mouths like tho&s;e of Balaam and Caiphas<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Father Paul's Hi&s;tory of Trent, lib. 1.</NOTE>.

every public fe&s;tival. The reformation of religion, which rou&s;ed a &s;pirit of enquiry, bani&s;hed that amu&s;ement, as not only low but indecent.

The&s;e Moralities have al&s;o been long bani&s;hed, except in Spain, where they &s;till con|tinue in vigour. The devil is commonly the hero: nor do the Spaniards make any difficulty, even in their more regular plays, to introduce &s;upernatural and allegorical beings upon the &s;ame &s;tage with men and women.

Lord Gallway, upon a painful &s;earch, found that bu&s;t &s;erving as a weight to a church-clock.</P>
<P>In the days of our barbarous forefathers, who were governed by pride as well as by hatred, princes and men of rank entertained a changeling, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of fool; who, being the butt of their &s;illy jokes, flattered their vanity. Such amu&s;ement, not le&s;s gro&s;s than inhuman, could not &s;how its face even in the dawn of ta&s;te: it was rendered le&s;s in&s;ipid and le&s;s inhuman, by entertaining one of real wit; who, under di&s;gui&s;e of a fool, was indulged in the mo&s;t &s;atirical truths. Upon a farther purification of ta&s;te, it was di&s;co|vered, that to draw amu&s;ement from folly, real or pretended, is below the dignity of human nature. More refined amu&s;ements were invented, &s;uch as balls, public &s;pectacles, gaming, and &s;ociety with women. Para&s;ites, de&s;cribed by Plautus and Te|rence, were of &s;uch a rank as to be permitted to dine with gentlemen; and yet were &s;o de&s;picable as to be the butt of every man's joke. They were placed at the lower end of the table; and the gue&s;ts diverted them&s;elves with daubing their faces, and

even kicking and cu&s;&s;ing them; all which was patiently borne, for the &s;ake of a plentiful meal. They re&s;embled the fools and clowns of later times, being equally intended to be laughed at: but the para&s;ite pro&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hows gro&s;&s;er manners; it being le&s;s indelicate to make game of fools, who were men of the lowe&s;t rank, than of para&s;ites, who were gentlemen by birth, though not by beha|viour.</P>
<P>Pride, which introduced fools, brought dwarfs al&s;o into fa&s;hion. In Italy, fondne&s;s for dwarfs was carried to extravagance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Being at Rome in the year 1566,"</Q> &s;ays a French writer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was invited by Cardinal Vitelli to a fea&s;t, where we were &s;erved by no fewer than thirty-four dwarfs, mo&s;t of them horridly di&s;torted."</Q> Was not the ta&s;te of that Cardinal horridly di&s;torted? The &s;ame author adds, that Francis I. and Henry II. Kings of France, had many dwarfs: one named Great John was the lea&s;t ever had been &s;een, if it was not a dwarf at Milan, who was carried about in a cage.</P>
<P>In the eighth and ninth centuries, no &s;ort of commerce was known in Europe, but what was carried on in markets and fairs. Artificers and manufacturers were di&s;per&s;ed through the country, and &s;o were mona&s;teries; the towns being inhabit|ed by none but clergymen, and tho&s;e who imme|diately depended on them. The nobility lived on their e&s;tates, unle&s;s when they followed the court. The low people were not at liberty to quit the place of their birth: the villain was annexed to the e&s;tate, and the &s;lave to the per&s;on of his lord. Slavery fo&s;tered rough manners; and there could be no improvement in manners, nor in ta&s;te, where there was no &s;ociety.

<L>" Have &s;till conform'd their genius to their age.</L>
<L>" Thus John&s;on did mechanic humour &s;how,</L>
<L>" When men were dull, and conver&s;ation low.</L>
<L>" Then comedy was faultle&s;s, but 'twas coar&s;e:</L>
<L>" Cobb's Tankard was a je&s;t, and Otter's Hor&s;e.</L>
<L>" Fame then was cheap, and the fir&s;t comer &s;ped:</L>
<L>" And they have kept it &s;ince by being dead.</L>
<L>" But were they now to write, when critics weigh</L>
<L>" Each line and ev'ry word throughout a play,</L>
<L>" None of them, no not John&s;on in his height,</L>

<L>" If love and honour now are higher rais'd,</L>

The high opinion Dryden had of him&s;elf and of his age breaks out in every line. John&s;on pro|bably had the &s;ame opinion of him&s;elf and of his age: the pre&s;ent age is not exempted from that bias; nor will the next age be, though probably maturity in ta&s;te will be &s;till later. We humble our&s;elves before the ancients who are far removed from us; but not to &s;oar above our immediate pre|dece&s;&s;ors, would be a &s;ad mortification. Many &s;cenes in Dryden's plays, if not lower than Cobb's Tankard or Otter's Hor&s;e, are more out of place. In the WILD GALLANT, the hero is a wretch con&s;tantly employed, not only in cheating his cre|ditors, but in cheating his mi&s;tre&s;s, a lady of high rank and fortune. And how ab&s;urd is the &s;cene, where he convinces the father of his mi&s;tre&s;s, that the devil had got him with child! The character of Sir Martin Marall is below contempt. The &s;cenes in the &s;ame play, of a bawd in&s;tructing one of her novices how to behave to her gallants, and of the novice practi&s;ing her le&s;&s;ons, are, per|haps, not lower than Cobb's Tankark or Otter's Hor&s;e, but &s;urely they are le&s;s innocent.</P>
<P>Portugal was ri&s;ing in power and &s;plendor when Camoens wrote the Lu&s;iad; and with re&s;pect to the mu&s;ic of ver&s;e, it has merit. The author, however, is far from &s;hining in point of ta&s;te. He makes a &s;trange jumble of Heathen and Chri&s;tian Deities. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gama,"</Q> ob&s;erves Voltaire, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in a &s;torm, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to Chri&s;t, but it is Ve|nus who comes to his relief."</Q> Voltaire's ob&s;er|vation is but too well founded. In the fir&s;t book, Jove &s;ummons a council of the gods, which is de|&s;cribed at great length, for no earthly purpo&s;e but to &s;how that he favoured the Portugue&s;e. Bacchus, on the other hand, declares again&s;t them upon the following account: That he him&s;elf had gained immortal glory as conqueror of the Indies; which
<PB N="124" REF="136">
would be eclip&s;ed, if the Indies &s;hould be con|quered a &s;econd time by the Portugue&s;e. A Moori&s;h commander having received Gama with &s;miles, but with hatred in his heart, the poet brings down Bacchus from heaven to confirm the Moor in his wicked purpo&s;es; which would have been perpetrated, had not Venus interpo&s;ed in Gama's behalf. In the &s;econd canto, Bacchus feigns him|&s;elf to be a Chri&s;tian, in order to deceive the Por|tugue&s;e; but Venus implores her father Jupiter to protect them. And yet, after all, I am loth to condemn an early writer for introducing Heathen Deities as actors in a real hi&s;tory, when in the age of Lewis XIV. celebrated for refinement of ta&s;te, we find French writers, Boileau in particular, guil|ty &s;ometimes of the &s;ame ab&s;urdity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, chap. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though ta&s;te in France is more correct than in any other nation, it will bear &s;till &s;ome purification. The &s;cene of a cly&s;ter-pipe in Moliere is too low even for a farce; and yet to this day it is acted, with a few &s;oftenings, before the mo&s;t polite au|dience in Europe.</P>
<P>In Elements of Critici&s;m<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chap. 25.</NOTE> &s;everal cau&s;es are mentioned that may retard ta&s;te in its progre&s;s to|ward maturity, and that &s;till more effectually may give it a retrograde motion when it is in maturity. There are many bia&s;&s;es, both natural and acquired, that tend to mi&s;lead per&s;ons, even of the be&s;t ta&s;te. Of the latter, in&s;tances are without number. I &s;elect one or two, to &s;how what influence even the &s;lighte&s;t circum&s;tances have on ta&s;te. The only tree beautiful at all &s;ea&s;ons is the holly: in winter, its deep and &s;hining green intitles it to be the queen of the grove: in &s;ummer, this colour completes the harmonious mixture of &s;hades &s;o plea&s;ing in that &s;ea|&s;on!

Mrs. D&mdash; is lively and &s;ociable. She, in particular, is eminent above mo&s;t of her &s;ex, for a correct ta&s;te, di&s;played not only within doors, but in the garden and in the field. Having become mi&s;tre&s;s of a great hou&s;e by matrimony, the mo&s;t honourable of all titles, a group of tall hollies, which had long been &s;uffered to ob&s;cure a capital room, &s;oon attracted her eye. She took an aver|&s;ion to a holly, and was not at ea&s;e till the group was extirpated. Such a bias is perfectly harmle&s;s. What follows is not altogether &s;o excu&s;able. The Oxonians di&s;liked the great Newton, becau&s;e he was educated at Cambridge; and they &s;avoured every book writ again&s;t him. That bias, I hope, has not come down to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>Refinement of ta&s;te in a nation is always accom|panied with refinement of manners: people ac|cu&s;tomed to behold order and elegance in public buildings and public gardens, acquire urbanity in private. But it is irk&s;ome to trudge long a beaten track, familiar to all the world; and, therefore, leaving what is &s;aid above, like a &s;tatue curtailed of legs and arms, I ha&s;ten to the hi&s;tory of the fine arts.</P>
<P>U&s;eful arts paved the way to fine arts. Men upon whom the former had be&s;towed every conve|nience, turned their thoughts to the latter. Beauty was &s;tudied in objects of &s;ight; and men of ta&s;te attached them&s;elves to the fine arts, which mul|tiplied their enjoyments and improved their be|nevolence. Sculpture and painting made an early figure in Greece; which afforded plenty of beau|tiful originals to be copied in the&s;e imitative arts. Statuary, a more &s;imple imitation than painting, was &s;ooner brought to perfection: the &s;tatue of Jupiter by Phidias, and of Juno by Polycletes, though the admiration of all the world, were exe|cuted long before the art of light and &s;hade was
<PB N="126" REF="138">
known. Apollodorus, and Zeuxis his di&s;ciple who flouri&s;hed in the fifteenth Olympiad, were the fir&s;t who figured in that art. Another cau&s;e con|curred to advance &s;tatuary before painting in Greece, viz. a great demand for &s;tatues of their gods. Architecture, as a fine art, made a &s;lower progre&s;s. Proportions, upon which its elegance chiefly depends, cannot be accurately a&s;certained, but by an infinity of trials in great buildings: a model cannot be relied on; for a large and a &s;mall building, even of the &s;ame form, require different proportions. Gardening, however, made a &s;till &s;lower progre&s;s than architecture: the palace of Alcinoous, in the &s;eventh book of the Ody&s;&s;ey, is grand and highly ornamented; but his gar|den is no better than what we term a kitchen|garden.</P>
<P>The ancient churches in this i&s;land cannot be our own invention, being unfit for a cold climate. The va&s;t &s;pace they occupy, quantity of &s;tone, and gloomine&s;s by excluding the &s;un, afford a re|fre&s;hing coolne&s;s, and fit them for a hot climate only. It is highly probable that they have been copied from the mo&s;ques in the &s;outh of Spain, erected there by the Saracens. Spain, when po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by that people, was the centre of arts and &s;ciences, and led the fa&s;hion in every thing beauti|ful and magnificent.</P>
<P>From the fine arts mentioned, we proceed to literature. It is agreed, among all antiquaries, that the fir&s;t writings were in ver&s;e, and that writing in pro&s;e was of a much later date. The fir&s;t Greek who wrote in pro&s;e was, Pherecides Syrus: the fir&s;t Roman was, Appius Caecus, who compo&s;ed a declamation again&s;t Pyrrhus. The four books of the Chatah Bhade, which is the &s;acred book of Hindo&s;tan, are compo&s;ed in ver&s;e &s;tanzas; and the Arabian compo&s;itions in pro&s;e followed long
<PB N="127" REF="139">
after tho&s;e in ver&s;e. To account for that &s;ingu|lar fact, many learned pens have been employed; but without &s;ucce&s;s. By &s;ome it has been urged, that as memory is the only record of events where writing is unknown, hi&s;tory originally was com|po&s;ed in ver&s;e for the &s;ake of memory. This is not &s;atisfactory. To undertake the painful ta&s;k of compo&s;ing in ver&s;e merely for the &s;ake of memory, would require more fore&s;ight than ever was exerted by a barbarian; not to mention that other means were u&s;ed for pre&s;erving the memory of remark|able events, a heap of &s;tones, a pillar, or other object that catches the eye. The account given by Longinus is more ingenious. In a fragment of his treati&s;e on ver&s;e, the only part that remains, he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that mea&s;ure or ver&s;e belongs to poetry, becau&s;e poetry repre&s;ents the various pa&s;&s;ions with their language; for which rea&s;on the ancients, in their ordinary di&s;cour&s;e, delivered their thoughts in ver&s;e rather than in pro&s;e."</Q> Lon|ginus thought, that anciently men were more ex|po&s;ed to accidents and dangers, than when they were protected by good government and by &s;orti|fied cities. But he &s;eems not to have adverted, that fear and grief, in&s;pired by dangers and mis|fortunes, are better &s;uited to humble pro&s;e than to elevated ver&s;e. I add, that however natural poeti|cal diction may be when one is animated with any vivid pa&s;&s;ion, it is not &s;uppo&s;able that the ancients never wrote nor &s;poke but when excited by pa&s;&s;ion. Their hi&s;tory, their laws, their co|venants, were certainly not compo&s;ed in that tone of mind.</P>
<P>An important article in the progre&s;s of the fine arts, which writers have not &s;ufficiently attended to, will, if I mi&s;take not, explain this my&s;tery. The article is the profe&s;&s;ion of a bard, which &s;prung up in early times, before writing was known, and died
<PB N="128" REF="140">
away gradually, as writing turned more and more common. The curio&s;ity of man is great with re|&s;pect to the tran&s;actions of his own &s;pecies; and when &s;uch tran&s;actions are de&s;cribed in ver&s;e, accompanied with mu&s;ic, the performance is en|chanting. An ear, a voice, &s;kill in in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, and, above all, a poetical genius, are requi&s;ite to excel in that complicated art. As &s;uch talents are rare, the &s;ew that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them were highly e&s;teemed; and hence the profe&s;&s;ion of a bard, which, be&s;ide natural talents, required more culture and exerci&s;e than any other known art. Bards were capital per&s;ons at every fe&s;tival and at every &s;olem|nity. Their &s;ongs, which, by recording the at|chievements of kings and heroes, animated every hearer, mu&s;t have been the entertainment of every warlike nation. We have He&s;iod's authority, that in his time bards were as common as potters or joiners, and as liable to envy. Demodocus is men|tioned by Homer as a celebrated bard<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ody&s;&s;ey, b. 8.</NOTE>; and Phemius, another bard, is introduced by him, de|precating the wrath of Uly&s;&s;es in the following words:<Q><L>" O king! to mercy be thy &s;oul inclin'd,</L>

the world were bards honoured than in Britain and Scandinavia.</P>
<P>Bards were the only hi&s;torians before writing was introduced. Tacitus<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">De Moribus Germanorum, cap. 2.</NOTE> &s;ays, that the &s;ongs of the German bards were their only annals. And Joannes Magnus, Archbi&s;hop of Up&s;al, acknow|ledges, that in compiling his hi&s;tory of the ancient Goths, he had no other records but the &s;ongs of the bards. As the&s;e &s;ongs made an illu&s;trious figure at every fe&s;tival, they were conveyed in every fa|mily by parents to their children; and in that man|ner were kept alive before writing was known.</P>
<P>The invention of writing made a con&s;iderable change in the bard-profe&s;&s;ion It is now an agreed point, that no poetry is fit to be accompanied with mu&s;ic, but what is &s;imple: a complicated thought or de&s;cription requires the utmo&s;t atten|tion, and leaves none for the mu&s;ic; or if it divide the attention, it makes but a faint impre&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 2. Appendix.</NOTE>. The &s;imple operas of Quinault bear away the palm from every thing of the kind compo&s;ed by Boileau or Racine. But when a language, in its progre&s;s to maturity, is enriched with variety of phra&s;es fit to expre&s;s the mo&s;t elevated thoughts, men of ge|nius a&s;pired to the higher &s;trains of poetry, leaving mu&s;ic and &s;ong to the bards: which di&s;tingui&s;hed the profe&s;&s;ion of a poet from that of a bard. Ho|mer, in a lax &s;en&s;e, may be termed a bard; for in that character he &s;trolled from fea&s;t to fea&s;t. But he was not a bard in the original &s;en&s;e: he, indeed, recited his poems to crowded audiences; but his poems are too complex for mu&s;ic, and he probably did not &s;ing them, nor accompany them with the lyre. The Trovadores of Provence were bards in the original &s;en&s;e, and made a capital figure
<PB N="131" REF="143">
in the days of ignorance, when few could read, and fewer write. In later times, the &s;ongs of the bards were taken down in writing, which gave every one acce&s;s to them without a bard; and the profe&s;&s;ion &s;unk by degrees into oblivion. Among the Highlanders of Scotland, reading and writing in their own tongue is not common even at pre&s;ent; and that circum&s;tance &s;upported long the bard-profe&s;&s;ion among them, after being forgot among the neighbouring nations. O&s;&s;ian was the mo&s;t celebrated bard in Caledonia, as Homer was in Greece<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The multitude are &s;truck with what is new and &s;plendid, but &s;eldom continue long in a wrong ta&s;te. Voltaire holds it to be a &s;trong te&s;timony for the Gieru|&s;aleme Liberata, that even the gondoliers in Venice have it mo&s;tly by heart; and that one no &s;ooner pro|nounces a &s;tanza than another carries it on. The works of O&s;&s;ian have the &s;ame te&s;timony for them: there are not many Highlanders, even of the lowe&s;t rank, but can repeat long pa&s;&s;ages out of them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After the foregoing hi&s;torical deduction, the reader will perceive, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, why the fir&s;t writings were in ver&s;e. The &s;ongs of the bards, being univer&s;al favourites, were cer|tainly the fir&s;t compo&s;itions that writing was em|ployed upon: they would be carefully collected by the mo&s;t &s;kilful writers, in order to pre&s;erve them in perpetual remembrance. The following part of the progre&s;s is equally obvious. People acquainted with no written compo&s;itions but what were in ver&s;e, compo&s;ed in ver&s;e their laws, their religious ceremonies, and every memorable tran&s;action that was intended to be pre&s;erved in memory by writing. But when &s;ubjects of writing multiplied, and be|came more and more involved, when people began to rea&s;on, to teach, and to harangue, they were obliged to de&s;cend to humble pro&s;e; for to con|fine
<PB N="132" REF="144">
a writer or &s;peaker to ver&s;e in handling &s;ub|jects of that nature, would be a burden un&s;up|portable.</P>
<P>The pro&s;e compo&s;itions of early hi&s;torians are all of them dramatic. A writer de&s;titute of art is naturally prompted to relate facts as he &s;aw them performed: he introduces his per&s;onages as &s;peak|ing and conferring; and he him&s;elf relates what was acted and not &s;poke. The hi&s;torical books of the Old Te&s;tament are compo&s;ed in that mode; and &s;o addicted to the dramatic are the authors of tho&s;e books, that they frequently introduce God him&s;elf into the dialogue. At the &s;ame time, the &s;implicity of that mode is happily &s;uited to the poverty of every language in its early periods. The dramatic mode has a delicious effect in ex|pre&s;&s;ing &s;entiment, and every thing that is &s;imple and tender<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See Elements of Critici&s;m, chap. 22.</NOTE>. Take the following in&s;tance of a low incident becoming, by that means, not a little intere&s;ting. Naomi having lo&s;t her hu&s;band and her two &s;ons in foreign parts, and purpo&s;ing to return to the land of her forefathers, &s;aid to her two daughters-in law, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Go, return each to her mother's hou&s;e: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. The LORD grant that you may find re&s;t, each of you in the hou&s;e of her hu&s;band. Then &s;he ki&s;&s;ed them: and they lift up their voice and wept. And they &s;aid unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people. And Naomi &s;aid, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more &s;ons in my womb, that they may be your hu&s;|bands? Turn again, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have an hu&s;band: if I &s;hould &s;ay, I have hope, if I &s;hould have an

And they lift up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah ki&s;&s;|ed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her. And &s;he &s;aid, Behold, thy &s;i&s;ter-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: re|turn thou after thy &s;i&s;ter-in-law. And Ruth &s;aid, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goe&s;t, I will go; and where thou lodge&s;t, I will lodge: thy people &s;hall be my people, and thy God my God: where thou die&s;t, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do &s;o to me, and more al&s;o, if aught but death part thee and me. When &s;he &s;aw that &s;he was &s;ted|fa&s;tly minded to go with her, then &s;he left &s;peaking unto her.<P>"So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem.

I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, &s;eeing the LORD hath te&s;tified again&s;t me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabite&s;s her daughter-in law with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley-harve&s;t.</P>
<P>"And Naomi had a kin&s;man of her hu&s;band's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Eli|melech;

<P>"And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and &s;aid unto the reapers, The LORD be with you: and they an&s;wered him, The LORD ble&s;s thee.

And the &s;ervant that was &s;et over the reapers an&s;wer|ed and &s;aid, It is the Moabiti&s;h dam&s;el that came back with Naomi, out of the country of Moab: and &s;he &s;aid, I pray you, let me glean, and gather after the reapers, among&s;t the &s;heaves: &s;o &s;he came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that &s;he tarried a little in the hou&s;e. Then &s;aid Boaz unto Ruth, Heare&s;t thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fa&s;t by my maidens. Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men, that they &s;hall not touch thee? and when thou art a-thir&s;t, go unto the ve&s;&s;els, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. Then &s;he fell on her face, and bowed her&s;elf to the ground, and &s;aid unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou &s;hould&s;t take knowledge of me, &s;eeing I am a &s;tranger? And Boaz an&s;wered and &s;aid unto her, It hath fully been &s;hewed me all that thou ha&s;t done unto thy mother-in-law &s;ince the death of thine hu&s;band; and how thou ha&s;t left thy father and

Then &s;he &s;aid, Let me find &s;avour in thy &s;ight, my lord, for that thou ha&s;t comforted me, and for that thou ha&s;t &s;poken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens. And Boaz &s;aid unto her, At meal-time come thou hi|ther, and eat of the bread, and dip thy mor&s;el in the vinegar. And &s;he &s;at by the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and &s;he did eat, and was &s;ufficed, and left. And when &s;he was ri&s;en up to glean, Boaz com|manded his young men, &s;aying, Let her glean even among the &s;heaves, and reproach her not. And let fall al&s;o &s;ome of the handfuls of purpo&s;e for her, and leave them, that &s;he may glean them, and rebuke her not. So &s;he gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that &s;he had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</P>
<P>"And &s;he took it up, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law &s;aw what &s;he had glean|ed: and &s;he brought forth, and gave to her that &s;he had re&s;erved, after &s;he was &s;ufficed.

And Naomi &s;aid unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field. So &s;he kept fa&s;t by the maidens of Boaz to glean, unto the end of barley-harve&s;t, and of wheat-harve&s;t; and dwelt with her mother-in-law.</P>
<P>"Then Naomi her mother-in-law &s;aid unto her, My daughter, &s;hall I not &s;eek re&s;t for thee, that it may be well with thee? And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with who&s;e maidens thou wa&s;t? Behold he winnoweth barley to-night in the thre&s;hing-floor. Wa&s;h thy&s;elf, therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thy&s;elf known unto the man, until he &s;hall have done eating and drinking. And it &s;hall be, when he lieth down, that thou &s;halt mark the place where he &s;hall lie, and thou &s;halt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down, and he will tell thee what thou &s;halt do.

<P>"And &s;he went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her. And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and &s;he came &s;oftly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</P>
<P>"And it came to pa&s;s at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned him&s;elf: and be|hold, a woman lay at his feet. And he &s;aid, Who art thou? And &s;he an&s;wered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: &s;pread, therefore, thy &s;kirt

And now it is true, that I am thy near kin&s;man: howbeit, there is a kin&s;man nearer than I. Tarry this night, and it &s;hall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kin&s;|man, well, let him do the kin&s;man's part; but if he will not do the part of a kin&s;man to thee, then will I do the part of a kin&s;man to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.</P>

<P>"And the kin&s;man &s;aid, I cannot redeem it for my&s;elf, le&s;t I mar mine own inheritance: re|deem thou my right to thy &s;elf, for I cannot redeem it.

<P>In the example here given are found frequent re|petitions; not however by the &s;ame per&s;on, but by different per&s;ons who have occa&s;ion in the cour&s;e of the &s;tory to &s;ay the &s;ame things; which is natural in the dramatic mode, where things are repre&s;ented preci&s;ely as they were tran&s;acted. In that view, Homer's repetitions are a beauty, not a blemi&s;h; for they are confined to the dramatic part, and ne|ver occur in the narrative.</P>
<P>But the dramatic mode of compo&s;ition, however plea&s;ing, is tedious and intolerable in a long hi&s;tory. In the progre&s;s of &s;ociety new appetites and new pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;e; men come to be involved with each other in various connections; incidents and events multiply, and hi&s;tory becomes intricate by an end|le&s;s variety of circum&s;tances. Dialogue accordingly is more &s;paringly u&s;ed, and in hi&s;tory plain narration is mixed with it. Narration is as it were the ground-work, and dialogue is rai&s;ed upon it, like flowers in embroidery. Homer is admitted by all to be the great ma&s;ter in that mode of compo&s;ition. Nothing can be more perfect in that re&s;pect than the Iliad. The Ody&s;&s;ey is far inferior; and to guard my&s;elf again&s;t the cen&s;ure of the blind admir|ers of Homer, a tribe extremely formidable, I call to my aid a celebrated critic, who&s;e &s;uperior ta&s;te and judgment never has been di&s;puted. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Ody&s;&s;ey,"</Q> &s;ays Longinus, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;hows how natural it is for a writer of a great genius, in his declining age, to &s;ink down to fabulous narration; for that Homer compo&s;ed the Ody&s;&s;ey after the Iliad is evident from many circum&s;tances. As the Iliad was compo&s;ed while his genius was in its greate&s;t vigour, the &s;tructure of that work is dramatic
<PB N="144" REF="156">
and full of action; the Ody&s;&s;ey, on the contrary, is mo&s;tly employ'd in narration, proceeding from the coldne&s;s of old age. In that later compo&s;ition, Homer may be compared to the &s;etting &s;un, which has &s;till the &s;ame greatne&s;s, but not the &s;ame ardor or force. We &s;ee not in the Ody&s;&s;ey that &s;ublime of the Iliad which con&s;tantly pro|ceeds in the &s;ame animated tone, that &s;trong tide of motions and pa&s;&s;ions flowing &s;ucce&s;&s;ively like waves in a &s;torm. But Homer, like the ocean, is great, even when he ebbs, and lo&s;es him&s;elf in narration and incredible fictions; witne&s;s his De|&s;cription of Tempe&s;ts, the Adventures of Uly&s;&s;es with Polyphemus the Cyclops, and many others<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Pilgrim's Progre&s;s and Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, great favourites of the vulgar, are compo&s;ed in a &s;tyle enliv|ened like that of Homer by a proper mixture of the dra|matic and narrative; and upon that account chiefly have been tran&s;lated into &s;everal European languages.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The narrative mode came in time &s;o to prevail, that in a long chain of hi&s;tory, the writer common|ly leaves off dialogue altogether. Early writers of that kind appear to have very little judgement in di&s;tingui&s;hing capital facts from minute circum&s;tan|ces, &s;uch as can be &s;upply'd by the reader without being mentioned. The hi&s;tory of the Trojan war by Dares Phrygius is a curious in&s;tance of that cold and creeping manner of compo&s;ition. Take the following pa&s;&s;age: Hercules having made a de&s;cent upon Troy, &s;lew King Laomedon, and made a pre&s;ent of He&s;ione, the King's daughter, to Tela|mon his companion. Priamus, who &s;ucceeded to the kingdom of Troy upon the death of his father Laomedon, &s;ent Antenor to demand his &s;i&s;ter He&s;i|one. Our author proceeds in the following manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Antenor, as commanded by Priamus, took &s;hip|ping, and &s;ailed to Magne&s;ia, where Peleus re|&s;ided.
<PB N="145" REF="157">
Pelens entertained him ho&s;pitably three days, and the fourth day demanded whence he came. Antenor &s;aid, that he was ordered by Priamus to demand from the Greeks, that they &s;hould re&s;tore He&s;ione. When Peleus heard this he was angry, becau&s;e it concerned his family, Telamon being his brother; and ordered the amba&s;&s;ador to depart. Antenor, without delay, retired to his &s;hip, and &s;ailed to Salamis, where Telamon re&s;ided, and demanded of him, that he &s;hould re&s;tore He&s;ione to her brother Priamus; as it was unju&s;t to detain &s;o long in &s;ervitude a young woman of royal birth. Telamon an&s;wer|ed, that he had done nothing to Priamus; and that he would not re&s;tore what he had received as a reward for his valour; and ordered Antenor to leave the i&s;land. Antenor went to Achaia; and &s;ailing from thence to Ca&s;tor and Pollux, demanded of them to &s;atisfy Priamus, b re&s;tor|ing to him his &s;i&s;ter He&s;ione. Ca&s;tor and Pollux denied that they had done any injury to Priamus, but that Laomedon had fir&s;t injured them; or|dering Antenor to depart. From thence he &s;ailed to Ne&s;tor in Pylus, telling him the cau&s;e of his coming; which when Ne&s;tor heard, he begun to exclaim, how Antenor dur&s;t &s;et his foot in Greece, &s;eeing the Greeks were fir&s;t injured by the Phrygians. When Antenor &s;ound that he had obtained nothing, and that Priamus was contumeliou&s;ly treated, he went on &s;hipboa d, and returned home."</Q> The Roman hi&s;tories be|fore the time of Cicero are chronicles merely. Cato, Fabius, Pictor, and Pi&s;o, confined them&s;elves to naked facts<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cicero De Oratore, lib. 2. No. 5.</NOTE>. In the Augu&s;lae Hi&s;toriae Scriptores we find nothing but a jejune narrative of facts, commonly of very little moment, concerning a de|generate people, without a &s;ingle incident that can rou&s;e the imagination, or exerci&s;e the judgement.

<P>The dry narrative manner being very little inte|re&s;ting or agreeable, a ta&s;te for embelli&s;hment prompted &s;ome writers to be copious and verbo&s;e. Saxo Grammaticus, who in the 12th century com|po&s;ed in Latin a hi&s;tory of Denmark, &s;urpri&s;ingly pure at that early period, is extremely verbo&s;e and full of tautologies.

Take the following example out of an endle&s;s number.

<P>The perfection of hi&s;torical compo&s;ition, which writers at la&s;t attain to after wandering through va|rious imperfect modes, is a relation of intere&s;ting facts connected with their motives and con&s;equences. A hi&s;tory of that kind is truly a chain of cau&s;es and effects. The hi&s;tory of Thucydides, and &s;till more that of Tacitus, are &s;hining in&s;tances of that mode.</P>
<P>A language in its original poverty, being defici|ent in &s;trength and variety, has nothing at com|mand for enforcing a thought but to redouble the expre&s;&s;ion.

<P>Eloquence was of a later date than the art of literary compo&s;ition; for till the latter was improv|ed, there were no models for &s;tudying the former. Cicero's oration for Ro&s;cius is compo&s;ed in a &s;tyle diffu&s;e and highly ornamented; which, &s;ays Plu|tarch, was univer&s;ally approved, becau&s;e at that time the &s;tyle of A&s;ia, introduced into Rome with its luxury, was in high vogue. But Cicero, in a journey to Greece, where he lei&s;urely &s;tudied Greek authors, was taught to prune off &s;uperfluities, and
<PB N="150" REF="162">
to purify his &s;tyle, which he did to a high degree of refinement. He introduced into his native tongue a &s;weetne&s;s, a grace, a maje&s;ty, that &s;urpri&s;ed the world, and even the Romans them&s;elves. Cicero ob&s;erves with great regret, that if ambition for power had not drawn Julius Cae&s;ar from the bar to command legions, he would have become the mo&s;t complete orator in the world. So partial are men to the profe&s;&s;ion in which they excel. Eloquence triumphs in a popular a&s;&s;embly, makes &s;ome figure in a court of law compo&s;ed of many judges; very little where there is but a &s;ingle judge, and none at all in a de&s;potic government. Eloquence flouri&s;hed in the republics of Athens and of Rome; and makes &s;ome figure at pre&s;ent in a Briti&s;h hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>The Greek &s;tage has been ju&s;tly admired among all polite nations. The tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides in particular are by all critics held to be perfect in their kind, excellent models for imitation, but far above rival&s;hip. I the Greek &s;tage was &s;o early brought to maturity, it is a phenomenon not a little &s;ingular in the progre&s;s of arts. The Greek tragedy made a rapid progre&s;s from The&s;pes to Sophocles and Euripides, who&s;e compo&s;itions are, indeed, the mo&s;t complete that ever were exhibited in Greece: but whether they be really &s;uch ma&s;ter|pieces as is generally thought, will admit of &s;ome doubt. The &s;ubject is curious: and I hope the candid reader will give attention to what follows.</P>
<P>No human voice could fill the Greek theatre, which was &s;o &s;pacious as to contain &s;everal thou|&s;ands without crowding. A bra&s;s pipe was invent|ed to &s;trengthen the voice; but that invention &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed the melody of pronunciation, by confining the voice to har&s;h monotony. The pipe was not the only unplea&s;ant circum&s;tance: every actor wore a ma&s;k; for what end or purpo&s;e, is not explained. It may be true, that the expre&s;&s;ions of the coun|tenance
<PB N="151" REF="163">
could not be di&s;tinctly &s;een by tho&s;e who occupied the back rows; and a ma&s;k po&s;&s;ibly was thought nece&s;&s;ary in order to put all the citizens upon a level. But without prying into the cau&s;e, let us only figure an actor with a ma&s;k and a pipe. He may repre&s;ent tolerably a &s;imple incident or plain thought, &s;uch as are the materials of an Ita|lian opera; but the voice, countenance, and ge&s;|tures, are indi&s;pen&s;able in expre&s;&s;ing refined &s;enti|ments, and the more delicate tones of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Where then lies the charm in ancient tragedies that captivated all ranks of men? Greek tragedies are more active than &s;entimental: they contain many &s;en&s;ible reflections on morals, manners, and upon life in general; but no &s;entiments except what are plain and obvious. The &s;ubjects are of the &s;imple&s;t kind, &s;uch as give ri&s;e to the pa&s;&s;ions of hope, fear, love, hatred, envy, and revenge, in their mo&s;t ordinary exertions: no intricate nor de|licate &s;ituation to occa&s;ion any &s;ingular emotion; no gradual &s;welling and &s;ub&s;iding of pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;eldom any conflict between different pa&s;&s;ions. I would not, however, be under&s;tood as meaning to depreciate Greek tragedies. They are, indeed, wonderful productions of genius, con&s;idering that the Greeks at that period were but beginning to emerge from roughne&s;s and barbarity into a ta&s;te for literature. The compo&s;itions of E&s;chylus, So|phocles, and Euripides, mu&s;t have been highly reli&s;hed among a people who had no idea of any thing more perfect. We judge by compari&s;on, and every work is held to be perfect that has no rival. It ought at the &s;ame time to be kept in view, that it was not the dialogue which chiefly enchanted the Athenians, nor variety in the pa&s;|&s;ions repre&s;ented, nor perfection in the actors, but machinery and pompous decoration, joined with exqui&s;ite mu&s;ic. That the&s;e particulars were car|ried
<PB N="152" REF="164">
to the greate&s;t height, we may with certainty conclude from the extravagant &s;ums be&s;tow'd on them: the exhibiting a &s;ingle tragedy was more expen&s;ive to the Athenians than their fleet or their army in any &s;ingle campaign.</P>
<P>One would imagine, however, that the&s;e com|po&s;itions were too &s;imple to enchant for ever; as variety in action, &s;entiment, and pa&s;&s;ion is requi|&s;ite, without which the &s;tage will not continue long a favourite entertainment and yet we find not a &s;ingle improvement attempted after the days of Sophocles and Euripides. This may appear a matter of wonder at fir&s;t view. But the wonder vani&s;hes upon con&s;idering, that the manner of per|formance prevented ab&s;olutely any improvement. A fluctuation of pa&s;&s;ion and refined &s;entiments would have made no figure on the Grecian &s;tage. Imagine the di&s;cording &s;cene between Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius in Julius Cae&s;ar to be there exhibited, or the handkerchief in the Moor of Venice: how &s;light would be their effect, when pronounced in a ma&s;k, and through a pipe? The workings of nature upon the countenance, and the flections of voice expre&s;&s;ive of various feelings, &s;o deeply affecting in modern repre&s;entation, would have been entirely lo&s;t. If a great genius had ari&s;en with talents for compo&s;ing a pathetic tragedy in perfection, he would have made no figure in Greece. An edifice mu&s;t have been erected of a moderate &s;ize: new actors mu&s;t have been trained to act with a bare face, and to pronounce in their own voice. And after all there remained a greater miracle &s;till to be performed, viz. a total reformation of ta&s;te in the people of Athens. In one word, the &s;implicity of the Greek tragedy was &s;uited to the manner of act|ing; and that manner excluded all improvements.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;&s;es an inference may with cer|tainty be drawn, that delicacy of ta&s;te and feeling
<PB N="153" REF="165">
were but faintly known among the Greeks, even when they made the greate&s;t figure. Mu&s;ic, indeed, may be &s;ucce&s;sfully employ'd in a &s;entimental tra|gedy; but pomp and &s;plendor of performance avail nothing. A &s;pectator deeply affected is regardle&s;s of decoration. I appeal to the reproving &s;cene be|tween Hamlet and the Queen his mother: does any man of ta&s;te be&s;tow the &s;lighte&s;t attention on the beauty of the &s;cenery? It would, however, be ra&s;h to involve in the &s;ame cen&s;ure every Athenian. Do not pantomime-&s;how, rope-dancing, and other &s;uch fa&s;hionable &s;pectacles, draw multitudes from the deepe&s;t tragedies? And yet among us there are per&s;ons of ta&s;te not a few, who de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch &s;pec|tacles as fit only for the mob, per&s;ons who never bow'd the knee to Baal. And if there were &s;uch per&s;ons in Athens, of which we have no rea&s;on to doubt, it proves the &s;uperiority of their ta&s;te; they had no example of more refined compo&s;itions than were exhibited on their &s;tage; we have many.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to comedy, it does not appear that the Greek comedy &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the tragedy in its pro|gre&s;s toward perfection. Horace mentions three &s;tages of Greek comedy. The fir&s;t was well &s;uited to the rough and coar&s;e manners of the Greeks, when Eupolis, Cratinus, and Ari&s;tophanes wrote. The&s;e authors were not a&s;hamed to repre&s;ent on the &s;tage real per&s;ons, not even di&s;gui&s;ing their names; of which we have a &s;triking in&s;tance in a comedy of Ari&s;tophanes called The Clouds, where Socrates is introduced, and mo&s;t contemptuou&s;ly treated. This &s;ort of comedy, &s;paring neither gods nor men, was re&s;trained by the magi&s;trates of Athens, &s;o far as to prohibit per&s;ons to be named on the &s;tage. This led writers to do what is done at pre&s;ent: the characters and manners of known per&s;ons were painted &s;o much to the life, that there could be no mi&s;take; and the &s;atire was indeed heightened by
<PB N="154" REF="166">
this regulation; as it was an additional plea&s;ure to find out the names that were meant in the repre|&s;entation. This was termed the middle comedy. But as there &s;till remained too great &s;cope for oblo|quy and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, a law was made prohibiting real events or incidents to be introduced upon the &s;tage. This law happily bani&s;hed &s;atire again&s;t individuals, and confined it to manners and cu&s;toms in general. Obedient to this law are the comedies of Menander, Philemon, and Diphilus, who flou|ri&s;hed about 300 years before the Chri&s;tian aera. And this is termed the third &s;tage of Greek comedy. The comedies of Ari&s;tophanes, which &s;till remain, err not le&s;s again&s;t ta&s;te than again&s;t decency. But we have good ground to believe, that the Greek comedy was con&s;iderably refined by Menander and his cotemporaries; and we mu&s;t rely upon colla|teral evidence, becau&s;e we have very few remains of their works. Their works, however, were far from perfection, if we can draw any conjecture from their imitator Plautus, who wrote about a century later. Plautus was a writer of genius; and it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that his copies did not fall much &s;hort of the originals, at lea&s;t in matters that can be faithfully copied; and he &s;hows very little art, either in his compo&s;itions, or in the conduct of his pieces. With re&s;pect to the former, his plots are wondrous &s;imple, very little varied, and very little intere&s;ting. The &s;ubject of almo&s;t every piece is a young man in love with a mu&s;ic-girl, de&s;iring to purcha&s;e her from the procurer, and employing a favourite &s;lave to cheat his father out of the price; and the different ways of accom|pli&s;hing the cheat is all the variety we find. In &s;ome few of his comedies the &s;tory ri&s;es to a higher tone, the mu&s;ic-girl being di&s;covered to be the daughter of a free man, which removes every ob|&s;truction to a marriage between her and her lover.
<PB N="155" REF="167">
In the conduct of his pieces there is a mi&s;erable defect of art. In&s;tead of unfolding the &s;ubject in the progre&s;s of the action, as is done by Terence, and by every modern writer, Plautus introduces a per&s;on for no other end but to explain the &s;tory to the audience. In one of his comedies, a hou&s;ehold|god is &s;o obliging as not only to unfold the &s;ubject, but to relate before-hand every particular that is to be repre&s;ented, not excepting the cata&s;trophe. Did not Plautus know, that it is plea&s;ant to have our curio&s;ity rai&s;ed about what will happen next? In the cour&s;e of the action, per&s;ons are frequently in|troduced who are heard talking to them&s;elves on the open &s;treet. One would imagine the Greeks to have been great babblers, when they could not refrain &s;oliloquies even in public. Could Plautus have been &s;o artle&s;s in the conduct of his pieces, had a more perfect model been exhibited to him by Menander or the other authors mentioned?</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, in Elements of Critici&s;m<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chap. 13.</NOTE>, that when a language begins to receive &s;ome poli&s;h, and the meaning of words is tolerably a&s;certained, then it is that a play of words comes to be reli&s;hed. At that period of the Roman language Plautus wrote. His wit con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely in a play of words, an eternal jingle, words brought together that have nearly the &s;ame &s;ound, with different meanings, and words of different &s;ounds that have the &s;ame meaning. As the Greek language had arrived to its perfection many years before, &s;uch fal&s;e wit may be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to Plautus him&s;elf, not to the Greeks from whom he copied. What was the period of that ba&s;tard wit in Greece, I know not; but it appears not to have been antiquated in Homer's days, witne&s;s the joke in the Ody&s;&s;ey, where Uly&s;&s;es impo&s;ed upon Polyphemus by calling
<PB N="156" REF="168">
him&s;elf Houtis or No-man. Nor &s;eems it to have been antiquated in the days of Euripides, who in his Cyclops repeats the &s;ame &s;illy joke. The Roman genius &s;oon purged their compo&s;itions of &s;uch infantine beauties; for in Terence, who wrote about fifty years later than Plautus, there is &s;carce a ve&s;tige of them. The dialogue be&s;ide of Terence is more natural and correct, not a word but to the purpo&s;e: Plautus is full of tautologies, and digre&s;|&s;ions very little to the purpo&s;e. In a word, con&s;i|dering the &s;low progre&s;s of arts, the Roman the|atre, from the time of Plautus to that of Terence, made as rapid a progre&s;s as perhaps ever happened in any country. Ari&s;totle defines comedy to be an imitation of light and trivial &s;ubjects provoking laughter. The comedies of Plautus corre&s;pond ac|curately to that definition: tho&s;e of Terence ri&s;e to a higher tone.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the di&s;advantages of the ma&s;k and pipe mentioned above, there are two cau&s;es that tended to keep back the Greek and Roman comedy from the perfection of its kind. The fir&s;t is the &s;low progre&s;s of &s;ociety among the&s;e nations, occa&s;ioned by debarring the female &s;ex from it. Without a mixture of the two &s;exes &s;ociety can never arrive at any degree of refinement, not to talk of perfection. That mixture brings to light every latent talent and every variety of character. To judge from ancient writers, man was a very plain being. Tacitus wrote when &s;ociety between the &s;exes was abun|dantly free; and in no author before him is to be found any thing beyond the outlines of character. In ancient comedies there are mi&s;ers, lovers, para|&s;ites, procurers; but the individuals of each cla&s;s are ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould. In the Rudens of Plautus, it is true, a mi&s;er is painted with much anxiety about his hidden trea&s;ure, every trifling incident being converted by him into a cau&s;e of
<PB N="157" REF="169">
&s;u&s;picion; but he is &s;till the &s;ame mi&s;er that is painted by others, without any &s;hade or &s;ingularity in the character. Homer is the only ancient that de&s;erves to be excepted: his heroes have all cou|rage; but courage in each is clearly of a different kind. Knowledge of an endle&s;s variety of character in the human &s;pecies, acquired from unre&s;trained &s;ociety, has enabled the moderns to enrich the theatre with new characters without end. What el&s;e is it but defect of knowledge in the di&s;po&s;itions of men that has confined Plautus and Terence, like the Italian comedy, to a very few characters?</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident than the &s;uperiority of Terence above Plautus in the art of writing; and con&s;idering that Terence is a later writer, nothing would appear more natural, if they did not copy the &s;ame originals. It may be owing to genius that Terence excell'd in purity of language, and pro|priety of dialogue; but how account for his &s;upe|riority over Plautus in the con&s;truction and conduct of a play? It will not certainly be thought, that Plautus would imitate the wor&s;t-con&s;tructed plays, leaving the be&s;t to tho&s;e who &s;hould come after him. This difficulty has not occurred to any of the commentators, &s;o far as I can recollect. Had the works of Menander and of his cotemporaries been pre&s;erved, they probably would have explain|ed the my&s;tery; which for want of that light will probably remain a my&s;tery for ever.</P>
<P>Homer has for more than two thou&s;and years been held the prince of poets. Such perfection in an author who flouri&s;hed when arts were far &s;hort of maturity, is &s;urpri&s;ing, is miraculous. An au|thor of genius<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on the Life and Writings of Homer.</NOTE> has endeavoured to account for this extraordinary phenomenon; and I willingly acknowledge, that he has exerted much indu&s;try,
<PB N="158" REF="170">
as well as invention; but, in my apprehen&s;ion, without giving much &s;atisfaction. The new light that is thrown above upon the Greek theatre has encouraged me to attempt a critici&s;m on the Iliad, in order to judge whether Homer has &s;o far anticipated the ordinary progre&s;s of nature, as, in a very early period, to have arrived at the per|fection of his art.</P>
<P>To form a good writer, genius and judgment mu&s;t concur. Nature &s;upplies the former; but to the latter in&s;truction and imitation are e&s;&s;en|tial. Shake&s;peare lived in an age that afforded him little opportunity to cultivate or improve his judgment; and though inimitable in every article that depends on genius, there are found many de|fects in the conduct of his plays, and in other par|ticulars that require judgment ripened by experi|ence. Homer lived in a rude age, little advanced in u&s;eful arts, and &s;till le&s;s in civilization and enlarged benevolence. The nations engaged in the Tro|jan war are de&s;cribed by him as in a progre&s;s from the &s;hepherd-&s;tate to that of agriculture. Frequent mention is made in the Iliad of the mo&s;t eminent men being &s;hepherds. Andromach&eacute;, in particular, mentions<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Book 6.</NOTE> &s;even of her brethren who were &s;lain by Achilles as they tended their father's flocks and herds. In that &s;tate, garments of woollen cloth were u&s;ed; but the &s;kins of bea&s;ts, the ori|ginal clothing, were &s;till worn as an upper gar|ment: every chief in the Iliad appears in that dre&s;s. Such, indeed, was the &s;implicity of this early period, that a black ewe was promi&s;ed by each chief to the man who would undertake to be a &s;py. In times of &s;uch &s;implicity, literature could not be far advanced; and it is a great doubt, whe|ther there was at that time a &s;ingle poem of the
<PB N="159" REF="171">
epic kind for Homer to imitate or improve upon. Homer is undoubtedly a wonderful genius, perhaps the greate&s;t that ever exi&s;ted: his fire, and the boldne&s;s of his conceptions, are inimitable. But in that early age, it would fall little &s;hort of a real miracle, to find &s;uch ripene&s;s of judgment, and correctne&s;s of execution, as in modern writers are the fruits of long experience, and progre&s;&s;ive improvements, during the cour&s;e of many centu|ries. Homer is far from being &s;o ripe, or &s;o correct. I &s;hall mention but two or three par|ticulars; for to dwell upon the imperfections of &s;o eminent an author is not plea&s;ant. The fir&s;t is, that he reduces his heroes to be little better than puppets. Not one of them performs an action of eclat, but with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome deity: even Achilles him&s;elf is every where aided by &s;uperior powers. It is Jupiter who in&s;pires Hector with boldne&s;s to perform the illu&s;trious actions that are &s;o finely de&s;cribed in the 15th book; and it is Jupiter, who, changing &s;ides, fills his heart with di&s;may. Glaucus, de&s;perately wound|ed, &s;upplicates Apollo, is miraculou&s;ly healed, and returns to the battle perfectly &s;ound. Hector, &s;truck to the ground with a &s;tone, and at the point of giving up the gho&s;t, is cured by Apollo, and &s;ent back to the battle with redoubled vi|gour. Homer re&s;embles a &s;ect of Chri&s;tians, who hold, that a man can do nothing of him&s;elf, but that God does all. Can Homer's admirers be &s;o blind as not to perceive, that this &s;ort of machinery detracts from the dignity of his heroes, renders them le&s;s intere&s;ting, and le&s;s worthy of admi|ration? Homer, however, is de&s;ervedly &s;uch a favourite, that we are prone to admit any excu&s;e. In days of ignorance, people are much addicted to the marvellous. Homer him&s;elf, it may be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed, was infected with that weakne&s;s; and he
<PB N="160" REF="172">
certainly knew that his hearers would be enchanted with every thing wonderful and out of the com|mon cour&s;e of nature. Another particular is, his digre&s;&s;ions without end, which draw our attention from the principal &s;ubject. I wi&s;h as good an apology could be made for them. Diomedes<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Book 6.</NOTE>, for in|&s;tance, meeting with Glaucus in the field of battle, and doubting, from his maje&s;tic air, whether he might not be an immortal, enquires who he was, declaring that he would not fight with a god. Glaucus lays hold of this very &s;light opportunity, in the very heat of action, to give a long hi&s;tory of his family. In the mean time, the reader's patience is put to a trial, and his ardor cools. Aga|memnon<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Book 14.</NOTE> de&s;iring advice how to re&s;i&s;t the Tro|jans, Diomedes &s;prings forward; but before he offers advice, gives the hi&s;tory of all his proge|nitors, and of their characters, in a long train. And, after all, what was the &s;age advice that required &s;uch a preface? It was, that Agamem|non &s;hould exhort the Greeks to fight bravely. At any rate, was Diomedes &s;o little known, as to make it proper to &s;u&s;pend the action at &s;o cri|tical a juncture for a genealogical hi&s;tory? There is a third particular, which ju&s;tly merits cen&s;ure; and that is, an endle&s;s number of minute circum|&s;tances, e&s;pecially in the de&s;cription of battles, where they are the mo&s;t improper. One capital beauty of an epic poem is, the &s;election of &s;uch in|cidents and circum&s;tances as make a deep impre&s;&s;i|on, keeping out of view every thing low or fami|liar<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 1. p. 232. edit. 5.</NOTE>. An account of a &s;ingle battle employs the whole fifth book of the Iliad, and a great part of the &s;ixth: yet in the whole there is no general
<PB N="161" REF="173">
action; but unknown warriors, whom we never heard of before, killed at a di&s;tance with an arrow or a javelin; and every wound de&s;cribed with ana|tomical accuracy. The whole &s;eventeenth book is employed in the conte&s;t about the dead body of Patroclus, &s;tuffed with minute circum&s;tances, be|low the dignity of an epic poem. In &s;uch &s;cenes the reader is fatigued with endle&s;s particulars; and has nothing to &s;upport him but the melody of Ho|mer's ver&s;ification. Gratitude would prompt one to apologize for an author who affords &s;o much plea&s;ure: the only apology I can think of for the particulars la&s;t-mentioned is, that Homer had no good models to copy after; and that without good models it is in vain to expect maturity of judgment. In a word, Homer was a blazing &s;tar, and the more to be admired, becau&s;e he blazed in an ob|&s;cure age. But that he &s;hould in no degree be tainted with the imperfections of &s;uch an age is a wild thought: it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, but by &s;up|po&s;ing him to be more than man.</P>
<P>Particular cau&s;es that advance the progre&s;s of fine arts, as well as of u&s;eful arts, are mentioned in the fir&s;t part of this Sketch, and to the&s;e I refer.</P>
<P>Having traced the progre&s;s of the fine arts to|ward maturity in a &s;ummary way, the decline of the&s;e arts comes next in order. An art, in its pro|gre&s;s toward maturity, is greatly promoted by emulation; and, after arriving at maturity, its down&s;al is not le&s;s promoted by it. It is difficult to judge of perfection but by compari&s;on; and an ar|ti&s;t, ambitious to out&s;trip his predece&s;&s;ors, cannot &s;ubmit to be an imitator, but mu&s;t &s;trike out &s;omething new, which, in an art advanced to ripene&s;s, &s;eldom &s;ails to be a degeneracy. This cau&s;e of the decline of the fine arts, I &s;hall endea|vour to illu&s;trate by various in&s;tances. The per|fection of vocal mu&s;ic is to accompany pa&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="162" REF="174">
to enforce &s;entiment. In ancient Greece, the pro|vince of mu&s;ic was well under&s;tood; which, being confined within its proper &s;phere, had an enchant|ing influence. Harmony at that time was very little cultivated, becau&s;e it was of very little u&s;e: melody reaches the heart, and it is by it chiefly that a &s;entiment is enforced, or a pa&s;&s;ion &s;oothed: harmony, on the contrary, reaches the ear only: and it is a matter of undoubted experience, that the mo&s;t melodious airs admit but of very &s;imple harmony. Arti&s;ts, in later times, ignorant why harmony was &s;o little regarded by the ancients, applied them&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly to its cultivation; and they had been wonderfully &s;ucce&s;sful. But they have been &s;ucce&s;sful at the expence of melody; which, in modern compo&s;itions, generally &s;peak|ing, is lo&s;t amid the blaze of harmony. The&s;e compo&s;itions tickle the ear by the luxury of com|plicated &s;ounds, but make &s;eldom any impre&s;&s;ion on the heart. The Italian opera, in its form, re|&s;embles the Greek tragedy, from which it is evi|dently copied; but very little in &s;ub&s;tance. In the latter, mu&s;ic being made &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;entiment, the dialogue is nervous and &s;ublime: in the former the whole weight is laid on mu&s;ic, and the dialogue, devoid of &s;entiment, is weak and &s;piritle&s;s. Re&s;tle&s;s man knows no golden mean, but will be attempting innovations without end<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Corelli excells all the other moderns in combining harmony with melody. His melody could not be richer, without impoveri&s;hing the harmony; and his harmony could not be richer, without impoveri&s;hing the melody. And, therefore, if harmony is requi&s;ite in any con&s;ide|rable degree, the productions of that author may be pronounced perfect.</NOTE>. By the &s;ame ambition, ar|chitecture has vi&s;ibly declined from its perfection. The Ionic was the favourite order when architecture was in its height of glory. The Corinthian order
<PB N="163" REF="175">
came next; which, in attempting greater perfec|tion, has deviated from the true &s;implicity of na|ture; and the deviation is &s;till greater in the Com|po&s;ite order<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 1. p. 206. edit. 5.</NOTE>. With re&s;pect to literary produc|tions, the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of the Romans were very im|perfect. We may judge of this from Plautus, who&s;e compo&s;itions are abundantly rude, tho' much admired by his cotemporaries, being the be&s;t that exi&s;ted at that time. The exalted &s;pirit of the Romans hurried them on to the grand and beau|tiful; and literary productions of all kinds were in perfection when Augu&s;tus reigned. In attempting &s;till greater perfection, the Roman compo&s;itions became a &s;trange jumble of incon&s;i&s;tent parts; they were tumid and pompous, and, at the &s;ame time, full of antithe&s;es, conceit, and tin&s;el wit. Every thing new in the fine arts plea&s;es, though le&s;s per|fect than what we are accu&s;tomed to; and, for that rea&s;on, &s;uch compo&s;itions were generally re|li&s;hed. We &s;ee not by what gradual &s;teps writers, after the time of Augu&s;tus, deviated from the pat|terns that were before them; for no book of any moment after that time is pre&s;erved, till we come down to Seneca, in who&s;e works nature and &s;implicity give place to artificial thought and ba&s;tard wit. He was a great corrupter of the Roman ta&s;te; and after him nothing was reli&s;hed but brilliant &s;trokes of fancy, with very little regard to &s;entiment: even Virgil and Cicero made no figure in compa|ri&s;on. Lucan has a forced elevation of thought and &s;tyle, very difficult to be &s;upported; and, ac|cordingly, he &s;inks often into puerile reflections; witne&s;s, his encomium on the river Po, which, &s;ays he, would equal the Danube, had it the &s;ame number of tributary &s;treams. Quintilian, a writer of true and cla&s;&s;ical ta&s;te, who was protected and
<PB N="164" REF="176">
encouraged by Ve&s;pa&s;ian, attempted to &s;tem the tide of fal&s;e writing. His rhetoric is compo&s;ed in an elegant &s;tyle; and his ob&s;ervations contain every delicacy of the critical art. At the &s;ame time flouri&s;hed Tacitus, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a more exten&s;ive knowledge of the nature of man, than any other author, ancient or modern, if Shake&s;peare be not excepted. His &s;tyle is original, conci&s;e, compact, and comprehen&s;ive; and, in what is properly called his hi&s;tory, perfectly correct and beautiful. He has been imitated by &s;everal, but never equalled by any. Brutus is &s;aid to be the la&s;t of the Ro|mans for love of liberty: Quintilian and Tacitus may be &s;aid to be the la&s;t of the Romans for lite|rary genius. Pliny the Younger is no exception: his &s;tyle is affected, turgid, and full of childi&s;h brilliancy. Seneca and Pliny are proper examples of writers who udy &s;how more than &s;ub&s;tance, and who make &s;en&s;e yield to &s;ound. 'The difference between the&s;e authors and tho&s;e of the Augu&s;tan age re&s;embles the difference between Greek and Italian mu&s;ic. Mu&s;ic, among the Greeks limited it&s;elf to the employment to which it is de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tined by nature, viz. to be the handmaid of &s;en&s;e, to enforce, enliven, or &s;weeten a &s;entiment. In the Italian opera, the mi&s;tre&s;s is degraded to be the handmaid; and harmony triumphs, with very little regard to &s;entiment.</P>
<P>Another great cau&s;e that precipitates the downfal of every fine art is de&s;poti&s;m. The rea&s;on is ob|vious; and there is a di&s;mal example of it in Rome, particularly with regard to eloquence. We learn from a dialogue accounting for the corruption of the Roman eloquence, that in the decline of the art it became fa&s;hionable to &s;tuff harangues with impertinent poetical quotations, without any view but ornament merely; and this al&s;o was long fa&s;hionable in France. It happened unluckily for
<PB N="165" REF="177">
the Romans, and for the world, that the fine arts were at their height in Rome, and not much upon the decline in Greece, when de&s;poti&s;m put an end to the republic. Augu&s;tus, it is true, retarded their fall, paticularly that of literature; it being the politic of his reign to hide de&s;poti&s;m, and to give his government an air of freedom. His court was a &s;chool of urbanity, where people of genius acquired that delicacy of ta&s;te, that eleva|tion of &s;entiment, and that purity of expre&s;&s;ion, which characterize the writers of his time. He honoured men of learning, admitted them to his table, and was bountiful to them. It would be painful to follow the decline of the fine arts in Rome to their total extirpation. The tyranny of Tiberius, and of &s;ub&s;equent emperors, broke at la&s;t the elevated and independent &s;pirit of the brave Romans, reduced them to abject &s;lavery, and left not a &s;park of genius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;ingular per&s;ecution was carried on by Pope Gregory, mo&s;t improperly &s;urnamed the Great, again&s;t the works of Cicero, Titus Livius, and Cornelius Ta|citus, which in every corner of Chri&s;tendom were pub|licly burnt; and from that time there has not been &s;een a complete copy of any of the&s;e authors. This happen|ed in the &s;ixth century: &s;o &s;oon had the Romans fallen, from the perfection of ta&s;te and knowledge, to the mo&s;t humbling barbarity. Nor was that the only per&s;ecution of books on the &s;core of religion. Many centuries before, a &s;imilar in&s;tance happened in China, direct|ed by a fooli&s;h emperor. The Alexandrian library was twice con&s;umed by fire, once in the time of Julius Cae|&s;ar, and once in the time of the Calif Omar: what a profu&s;ion of knowledge was lo&s;t pa&s;t redemption! And yet, upon the whole, it &s;eems doubtful, whether the moderns have &s;uffered by the&s;e events. At what cor|ner of a library &s;hall a man begin, where he &s;ees an in|finity of books, choice ones too? Even the mo&s;t re|&s;olute would be deterred from reading at all.</NOTE>. The &s;cience of law is the
<PB N="166" REF="178">
only exception, as it flouri&s;hed even in the wor&s;t of times: the Roman lawyers were a re&s;pectable body, and le&s;s the object of jealou&s;y than men of power and exten&s;ive landed property. Among the Greeks al&s;o, a conquered people, the fine arts decayed; but not &s;o rapidly as at Rome; the Greeks, farther removed from the &s;eat of govern|ment, being le&s;s within the reach of a Roman ty|rant. During their depre&s;&s;ion, they were guilty of the mo&s;t puerile conceits; witne&s;s, ver&s;es com|po&s;ed in the form of an axe, an egg, wings, and &s;uch like. The &s;tyle of Greek authors in the reign of the Emperor Adrian is unequal, ob&s;cure, &s;tiff, and affected. Lucian is the only exception I am acquainted with.</P>
<P>We need &s;carce any other cau&s;e but de&s;poti&s;m to account for the decline of &s;tatuary and painting in Greece. The&s;e arts had arrived at their utmo&s;t perfection about the time of Alexander the Great; and from that time they declined gradually with the vigour of a free people; for Greece was now en&s;lav|ed by the Macedonian power. It may in general be ob&s;erved, that when a nation becomes &s;tationary in that degree of power which it acquires from its con&s;titution and &s;ituation, the national &s;pirit &s;ub&s;ides, and men of talents become rare. It is &s;till wor&s;e with a nation that is &s;unk below its former power and pre-eminence; and wor&s;t of all when it is re|duced to &s;lavery. Other cau&s;es concurred to ac|celerate the downfal of the arts mentioned. Greece, in the days of Alexander, was filled with &s;tatues of excellent workman&s;hip; and there being little de|mand for more, the later &s;tatuaries were reduced to heads and bu&s;ts. At la&s;t the Romans put a total end both to &s;tatuary and painting in Greece, by plundering it of its fine&s;t pieces; and the Greeks, expo&s;ed to the avarice of the conquerors, be&s;tow'd no longer any money on the fine arts.

<P>There is a particular cau&s;e that never fails to un|dermine a fine art in a country where it is brought to perfection, ab&s;tracting from every one of the cau&s;es above mentioned.

of &s;tatuary and painting among the Greeks, even tho' they had continued a free people. The decay of painting in modern Italy is, probably, owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e: Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, &amp;c. are lofty oaks that bear down young plants in their neighbourhood, and intercept from them the &s;un&s;hine of emulation.

<P>The decline of an art or &s;cience proceeding from the foregoing cau&s;e, is the mo&s;t rapid where a &s;trict compari&s;on can be in&s;tituted between the works of different ma&s;ters. The &s;uperiority of Newton above every other mathematician can be a&s;certained with preci&s;ion; and hence the &s;udden decline of that &s;cience in Great Britain. In Italy a talent for paint|ing continued many years in vigour, becau&s;e no painter appeared with &s;uch &s;uperiority of genius as to carry perfection into every branch of the art. As one &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in de&s;igning, one in colouring, one in graceful attitudes, there was &s;till &s;cope for emulation.

<P>Corruption of the Latin tongue makes a proper appendix to the decline of the fine arts in Rome. That the Latin tongue did not long continue in pu|rity after the Emperor Augu&s;tus, is certain; and all writers agree, that the cau&s;e of its early corruption was a continual influx into Rome of men to whom the Latin was a foreign language. The rea&s;on is plau&s;ible; but whether &s;olid may ju&s;tly be doubted. In all countries there are provincial dialects; which, however, tend not to corrupt the language of the capital, becau&s;e they are carefully avoided by all who pretend to &s;peak properly; and accordingly the multitude of provincials who flock to Paris and London have no effect to deba&s;e the language. The &s;ame probably was the ca&s;e in old Rome, e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to &s;trangers, who&s;e native tongue was totally different from that of Rome: their imperfect manner of &s;peaking Latin might be excu&s;ed, but certainly was not imitated. Slaves in Rome had little conver&s;ation with their ma&s;ters, except in re|ceiving orders or reproof; which had no tendency to vitiate the Latin tongue. The corruption of that tongue, and at la&s;t its death and burial, as a living language, were the re&s;ult of two combined cau&s;es; of which the early prevalence of the Greek language in Rome is the fir&s;t. Latin was native to the Romans only, and to the inhabitants of La|tium. The languages of the re&s;t of Italy were numerous: the Me&s;&s;apian was the mother-tongue
<PB N="172" REF="184">
in Aupulia, the Hetru&s;can in Tu&s;cany and Umbria, the Greek in Magna Graecia, the Celtic in Lom|bardy and Liguria, &amp;c. &amp;c. Latin had arrived at its purity not many years before the reign of Au|gu&s;tus; and had not taken deep root in tho&s;e parts of Italy where it was not the mother-tongue, when Greek came to be the fa&s;hionable language among people of rank, as French is in Europe at pre&s;ent. Greek, the &s;torehou&s;e of learning, prevailed in Rome, even in Cicero's time; of which he him&s;elf bears te&s;timony in his oration for the poet Arachias. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Graeca leguntur in omnibus fere gentibus: Lati|na &s;uis finibus, exiguis &s;ane, continentur."</Q> And for that rea&s;on Atticus is warmly &s;olicited by him to write the hi&s;tory of his con&s;ul&s;hip in Greek. Thus Latin, jo&s;tled by Greek out of its place, was left to inferiors; and, probably, would have &s;unk to utter oblivion, even though the republic had continued in vigour. But the chief cau&s;e was the de&s;poti&s;m of the Roman government, which proved the de|&s;truction of the fine arts, and of literature in parti|cular. In a country of &s;o many different languages the Latin tongue could not be pre&s;erved in purity, but by a con&s;tant peru&s;al of Roman cla&s;&s;ics: but the&s;e were left to rot in libraries, a dark cloud of ignorance having over&s;pread the whole empire. Every per&s;on carele&s;sly &s;poke the language acquired in the nur&s;ery; and people of different tongues be|ing mixed under one government, without a com|mon &s;tandard, fell gradually into a &s;ort of mixed language, which every one made a &s;hift to under|&s;tand. The irruption of many barbarous nations into Italy, &s;everal of whom &s;ettled there, added to the jargon. And that jargon, compo&s;ed of many heterogeneous parts was, in proce&s;s of time, purified to the tongue that is now native to all the inhabi|tants of Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="185">
In a hi&s;tory of the Latin tongue, it ought not to be overlooked, that it continued long in purity among the Roman lawyers. The &s;cience of law was in Rome more cultivated than in any other country. The books writ upon that &s;cience in La|tin were numerous; and, being highly regarded, were the con&s;tant &s;tudy of every man who a&s;pired to be an eminent lawyer. Neither could &s;uch men have any bias to the Greek tongue, as law was lit|tle cultivated in Greece. Thus it happened, that the Latin tongue, &s;o far as concerns law, was pre|&s;erved in purity, even to the time of the Emperor Ju&s;tinian.</P>
<P>Greek was pre&s;erved in purity much longer than Latin. The &s;ame Language was &s;poken through all Greece, with &s;ome &s;light varieties in dialect. It was brought to great perfection and firmly rooted during the pro&s;perous days of Greece. Its cla&s;&s;ics were numerous, and the &s;tudy of every per&s;on who pretended to literature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There &s;till remain about three thou&s;and Greek books: of Latin books not above &s;ixty.</NOTE>. Now, tho' the free and manly &s;pirit of the Greeks yielded to Roman de&s;|poti&s;m, yet while any appetite for literature remain|ed, their invaluable ola&s;&s;ics were a &s;tandard, which pre&s;erved the language in purity. But ignorance at length became univer&s;al, and the Greek cla&s;&s;ics cea&s;ed to be a &s;tandard, being buried in libraries, as the Roman cla&s;&s;ics had been for centuries. In that &s;tate, the Greek tongue could not fail to degenerate, among an ignorant and &s;ervile people, who had no longer any ambition to act well, write well, or &s;peak well. And yet, after all, that beautiful tongue, far beyond arival, has &s;uffered le&s;s alteration than any other ever did in &s;imilar circum&s;tances; one cau&s;e of which is, that to this day the Greeks live &s;epa|rate
<PB N="174" REF="186">
from their ma&s;ters the Turks, and have little commerce with them.</P>
<P>From the fate of the Latin tongue, an ob&s;erva|tion is drawn by many writers, that all languages are in a continual flux, changing from age to age without end. And &s;uch as are fond of fame, de|plore it as a heavy misfortune, that the language in which they write will &s;oon become ob&s;olete and unintelligible. But it is a common error in rea&s;on|ing, to found a general conclu&s;ion upon a &s;ingle fact. In its progre&s;s toward perfection, a language is continually improving, and therefore continually changing. But &s;uppo&s;ing a language to have ac|quired its utmo&s;t perfection, I &s;ee nothing that &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion any change: on the contrary, the cla&s;&s;ical books in that language be|come a &s;tandard for writing and &s;peaking, to which every man of ta&s;te and figure conforms him&s;elf. Such was the ca&s;e of the Greek tongue, till that people were brutified by de&s;poti&s;m: the Italian has continued in perfection more than three centuries, and the French more than one. The Engli&s;h lan|guage has not yet acquired all the purity it is &s;u&s;|ceptible of: but when there is no place for further improvements, there &s;eems little doubt of its be|coming &s;tationary, like the languages now menti|oned. I bar always &s;uch a revolution as eradicates knowledge, and reduces a people to a &s;tate of bar|barity. In an event &s;o di&s;mal, the de&s;truction of cla&s;&s;ical books, and of a pure language, will not be the chief calamity: they will be little regretted in the univer&s;al wreck. In the mean time, to a writer of genius in a poli&s;hed nation it cannot but be a charming pro&s;pect, that his works will &s;tand and fall with his country. To make &s;uch a writer ex|ert his talents for purifying his mother-tongue, and for adding to the number and reputation of its cla&s;|&s;ics,

<P>As, before the invention of printing, writers could have nothing in view but reputation and prai&s;e, they endeavoured to give the utmo&s;t perfection to their compo&s;itions. They at the &s;ame time &s;tudied bre|vity, in order that their works might be diffu&s;ed through many hands; for the expence of tran&s;crib|ing great volumes could not be afforded by every reader. The art of printing has made a great change: the opportunity it furni&s;hes to multiply copies has degraded writing to be a lucrative em|ployment. Authors now &s;tudy to &s;well their works, in order to &s;well the price; and being in a hurry for money, they neglect the precept of Horace, Nonum prematur in annum. Take for example the natural hi&s;tory of Aldrovandus, in many folio volumes. After filling his common-place book with pa&s;&s;ages from every author, ancient and modern, to the pur|po&s;e and not to the purpo&s;e, he &s;its down to com|po&s;e, bent to transfu&s;e into his book every article thus painfully collected. For example, when he introduces the ox, the cock, or any other animal; far from confining him&s;elf to its natural hi&s;tory, he omits nothing that has been &s;aid of it in books where it has been occa&s;ionally introduced, not even excepting tales for amu&s;ing children: he mentions all the &s;uper&s;titious notions concerning it, every poetical compari&s;on drawn from it, the u&s;e it has &s;erved in hieroglyphics and in coats-armorial; in a word, all the hi&s;tories and all the fables in which it has been named. Take another in&s;tance from a German or Dutch chronologer, who&s;e name has e&s;caped me, and which I give in a tran&s;lation from the Latin, to prevent the bias that one has for a learned language. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sam&s;on was the &s;ame with the Theban Hercules; which appears from the

actions attributed to each of them, e&s;pecially from the following, That Hercules, unarmed, is &s;aid to have &s;uffocated the Nemean lion with a &s;queeze of his arms: Sam&s;on unarmed did the &s;ame, by tearing a lion to pieces; and Jo&s;ephus &s;ays, that he did not tear the lion, but put out his breath with a &s;queeze; which could be done, and was done by Scutileus the wre&s;tler, as re|ported by Suidas. David al&s;o, unarmed, tore to pieces a lion, 1 Samuel, chap. xvii.; and Benaiah the &s;on of Jehojada al&s;o &s;lew a lion, 2 Samuel, chap. xxiii. ver. 20. Moreover we read, that Sam&s;on, having caught three hundred foxes, tied lighted firebrands to their tails, and drove them into the &s;tanding corn of the Phili&s;|tines, by which both the &s;hocks and &s;tanding corn, with the vineyards and olives, were burnt up. Many think it incredible, that three hundred foxes &s;hould be caught by one man; as the fox, being the mo&s;t cunning of all animals, would not &s;uffer it&s;elf to be ea&s;ily taken. Accordingly Op|pian, a Greek poet, who writes upon hunting, a&s;&s;erts, that no fox will &s;uffer it&s;elf to be taken in a gin or a net; though we are taught the con|trary by Martial, lib. 10. epig. 37. <Q>Hic oldium clamo&s;us ages in retia vulpem.</Q> In India, eagles, hawks, and ravens, are taught to hunt foxes, as we are informed by Olianus, Var. hi&s;t. lib. 9. cap. 26. They are al&s;o caught by traps and &s;nares, and in covered pits, as wolves are, and other large animals. Nor is it wonder|ful that &s;uch a multitude of foxes were caught by Sam&s;on, con&s;idering that Pale&s;tine abounded with foxes. He had hunters without number at com|mand; and he was not confined in time. The fame of that exploit was &s;pread far and near.
<PB N="177" REF="189">
Even among the Romans there were ve&s;tiges of it, as appears from Ovid, Fa&s;t. lib. 9. ver. 681. In one Roman fe&s;tival, armed foxes were let loo&s;e in the Circus; which Ovid, in the place quoted, &s;ays, was done in memory of the Car&s;i|olan fox, which, having de&s;troy'd many hens belonging to a country-woman, was caught by her, and puni&s;hed as follows. She wrapped up the fox in hay, which &s;he fet fire to; and the fox being let go, fled through the &s;tanding corn, and &s;et it on fire. There can be no doubt but that this fe&s;tival was a ve&s;tige of Sam&s;on's foxes, not only from congruity of circum&s;tances, but from the time of celebration, which was the month of April, the time of harve&s;t in Pale&s;tine. [See more about foxes in Burman's works."]</Q> Not to mention the ridiculous arguments of this writer to prove Sam&s;on to be the &s;ame with the Theban Hercules, nor the childi&s;h wanderings from that &s;ubject, every one mu&s;t be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;ible of his having overlooked the chief difficulty. However well fixed the fire-brands might be, it is not ea&s;ily conceivable, that the foxes, who would naturally fly to their lurking-holes, could much injure the corn, or the olive trees. And it is as little conceivable, what &s;hould have moved Sam&s;on to employ foxes, when, by our author's &s;uppo&s;ition, he had men at com|mand, much better qualified than foxes for com|mitting wa&s;te. This author would have &s;aved him|&s;elf much idle labour, had he embraced a very probable opinion, that if the tran&s;lation be not er|roneous, the original text mu&s;t be corrupted.

<HEAD>SKETCH VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Progre&s;s of the FEMALE SEX.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the female &s;ex, a capital branch of the hi&s;tory of man, comprehends great variety of matter, curious and intere&s;ting. But &s;ketches are my province, not complete hi&s;to|ries; and I propo&s;e, in the pre&s;ent &s;ketch, to trace the gradual progre&s;s of women, from their low &s;tate in &s;avage tribes, to their elevated &s;tate in ci|vilized nations.</P>
<P>With regard to the outlines, whether of internal di&s;po&s;ition, or of external figure, men and women are preci&s;ely the &s;ame. Nature, however, intend|ing them for mates, has given them characters dif|ferent, but concordant, &s;o as to produce together delicious harmony. The man, naturally more ro|bu&s;t, is fitted for &s;evere labour and for field-exer|ci&s;es; the woman for &s;edentary occupations; and particularly for nur&s;ing children. To that diffe|rence the mind al&s;o contributes. A boy is always running about; delights in a top or a ball; and rides upon a &s;tick for want of a hor&s;e. A girl has le&s;s inclination to move: her fir&s;t amu&s;ement is a ba|by; which &s;he delights to dre&s;s and undre&s;s. The man, bold and vigorous, is qualified for being a protector: the woman, delicate and timid, requires protection. The man, as a protector, is directed by nature to govern: the woman, con&s;cious of in|feriority, is di&s;po&s;ed to obedience. Their intellec|tual powers corre&s;pond to the de&s;tination of nature:
<PB N="182" REF="194">
men have penetration and &s;olid judgment to fit them for governing: women have &s;ufficient under|&s;tanding to make a decent figure under good go|vernment; a greater proportion would excite dan|gerous rival&s;hip. Add another capital difference of character: the gentle and in&s;inuating manners of the female &s;ex tend to &s;often the roughne&s;s of the other &s;ex; and where-ever women are indulg|ed with any freedom, they poli&s;h &s;ooner than men.</P>
<P>The&s;e are not the only particulars that di&s;tin|gui&s;h the &s;exes. With re&s;pect to matrimony, it is the privilege of the male, as &s;uperior and protec|tor, to make a choice: the female preferred has no privilege, but barely to con&s;ent or to refu&s;e. Nature fits them for their different parts: the male is bold, the female ba&s;hful. Hence, among all nations, it is the practice for men to court, and for women to be courted: which holds al&s;o among many other animals, probably among all that pair.</P>
<P>Another di&s;tinction is equally vi&s;ible: the ma|&s;ter of a family is immediately connected with his country: his wife, his children, his &s;ervants, are immediately connected with him, and with their country, through him only. Women, ac|cordingly, have le&s;s patrioti&s;m than men; and le&s;s bitterne&s;s again&s;t the enemies of their country.</P>
<P>The peculiar mode&s;ty of the female &s;ex is al&s;o a di&s;tingui&s;hing circum&s;tance. Nature hath pro|vided them with it as their chief defence again&s;t the artful &s;olicitations of the other &s;ex before marriage, and al&s;o the chief &s;upport of conjugal fidelity. It is held to be their capital virtue; and a woman who &s;urrenders her cha&s;tity is univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed; though in a man cha&s;tity is &s;carce held to be a virtue, except in the married &s;tate. But of that more fully afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="195">
A fundamental article in the pre&s;ent &s;ketch is, Matrimony; and it has been much controverted, whether it be an appointment of nature, or only of municipal law. Many writers have exerci&s;ed their talents in that controver&s;y, but without giv|ing any &s;atisfaction to a judicious enquirer. If I mi&s;take not, it may be determined upon &s;olid principles; and as it is of importance in the hi&s;tory of man, the reader, I am hopeful, will not be di&s;|gu&s;ted at the length of the argument.</P>
<P>Many writers hold, that women were originally common; and animal love was gratified as among hor&s;es and horned cattle; and that matrimony was not known till nations grew, in &s;ome degree, to be orderly and refined. I &s;elect Cicero as an au|thor of authority: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nam fuit quoddam tempus, cum in agris homines pa&s;&s;im, be&s;tiarum more, vagabantur, et &s;ibi victu ferino vitam propa|gabant: nec ratione animi quicquam &s;ed ple|raque viribus corporis admini&s;trabant. Nondum divinae religionis, non humani officii ratio co|lebatur. Nemo legitimas viderit nuptias, non certos qui&s;quam in&s;pexerat libros<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For there was a time, when men, like the brutes, roamed abroad over the earth, and fed, like wild bea&s;ts, upon other animals. Then rea&s;on bore no &s;way, but all was ruled by &s;uperior &s;trength. The ties of religion, and the obligations of morality, were then unfelt. Lawful marriage was unknown, and no father was certain of his offspring."</Q></NOTE><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De Inventione, lib. 1.</NOTE>."</Q> Pliny, in &s;upport of that doctrine, informs us, that the Garamantes, an African nation, lived promi&s;cuou&s;ly together, without any notion of matrimony. Among the Au&s;es, a people of Libya, as Herodotus &s;ays, matrimony was not known, and men cohabited with women indifferently, like other animals. A boy educated by his mother was, at a certain age,
<PB N="184" REF="196">
admitted to an a&s;&s;embly of the men, and the man he clung to was reputed his father. Ju&s;tin and other authors report, that, before Cecrops, who reigned in Attica about 1600 years before Chri&s;t, marriage was not known in Greece; and that the burden of children lay upon the mother.</P>
<P>Before entering directly into the matter, it is proper to remove, if po&s;&s;ible, the bias of the&s;e great names. The practice of the Garamantes and of the Au&s;es is mentioned by Pliny and Herodotus as &s;ingular; and, were it better vouch|ed than it is, it would avail very little again&s;t the practice of all other nations. Little weight can be laid upon Pliny's evidence in particular, con&s;idering what he reports in the &s;ame chapter of the Blemmayans, that they had no head, and that the mouth and eyes were in the brea&s;t. Pliny, at the &s;ame time, as well as Herodotus, being very deficient in natural knowledge, was gro&s;sly credu|lous; and cannot be relied on, with re&s;pect to any thing &s;trange or uncommon. As to what is re|ported of ancient Greece, Cecrops po&s;&s;ibly prohibi|ted polygamy, or introduced &s;ome other matrimoni|al regulation, which, by writers, might be mi&s;taken for a law appointing matrimony. However that be, one part of the report is undoubtedly fal&s;e; for it will be made evident afterward, that, in the hunter-&s;tate, or, even in that of &s;hepherds, it is impracticable for any woman, by her own in|du&s;try alone, to rear a numerous i&s;&s;ue. If this be at all po&s;&s;ible, it can only be in the torrid zone, where people live on fruits and roots, which are produced in plenty with very little labour. Upon that account Diodorus Siculus is le&s;s blameable for li&s;tening to a report, that the inhabitants of Tapro|bana, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the i&s;land of Ceylon, never marry, but that women are u&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly. But as there is no &s;uch practice known at pre&s;ent
<PB N="185" REF="197">
in the Ea&s;t Indies, there is no ju&s;t ground to believe, that it ever was the practice; and the Ea&s;t Indies were &s;o little known to the ancient Greeks, that their authors cannot be much relied on in the accounts they give of that di&s;tant region. The opinion of Cicero may &s;eem to have more weight at fir&s;t view; and yet a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation will re|duce it to nothing. The notions of that author upon the primitive &s;tate of man mu&s;t confe&s;&s;edly be exceedingly crude, when he denies to &s;avages any &s;en&s;e of religion or of moral duty. Ought we to rely more on him, when he denies, that they have any notion of matrimony? Cae&s;ar's account of the ancient Britons approaches the neare&s;t to a loo&s;e commerce with women, though in the main it is good evidence again&s;t the opinion of Cicero. It was common, he &s;ays, for a number of bro|thers, or other near relations, to u&s;e their wives promi&s;cuou&s;ly. The offspring, however, were not common; for each man maintained the children that were produced by his own wife. Herodotus reports the &s;ame of the Ma&s;&s;agetae.</P>
<P>Laying thus a&s;ide the great names of Cicero, Herodotus, and Pliny, the field lies open to a fair and impartial inve&s;tigation. And as the means provided by nature for continuing the race of other animals may probably throw light upon the oeco|nomy of nature with re&s;pect man, I begin with that article, which has not engaged the attention of naturali&s;ts &s;o much as it ought to do. With re&s;pect to animals who&s;e nouri&s;hment is gra&s;s, pairing would be of no u&s;e: the female feeds her|&s;elf and her young at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and the male has nothing to do. On the other hand, all brute animals, who&s;e young require the nur&s;ing care of both parents, are directed by nature to pair; nor is that connection di&s;&s;olved till the young can provide for them&s;elves. Pairing is indi&s;pen&s;able to
<PB N="186" REF="198">
wild birds that build on trees; becau&s;e the male mu&s;t provide food for his mate while &s;he is hatch|ing the eggs. And as they have commonly a nu|merous i&s;&s;ue, it requires the labour of both to pick up food for them&s;elves and for their young. Upon that account it is &s;o ordered, that the young are &s;ufficiently vigorous to provide for them&s;elves, be|fore a new brood is produced.</P>
<P>What I have now opened &s;ugge&s;ts the following que&s;tion, Whether, according to the animal oeco|nomy above di&s;play'd, are we to pre&s;ume, or not, that man is directed by nature to matrimony? If analogy can be rely'd on, the affirmative mu&s;t be held, as there is no other creature in the known world to which pairing is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary. Man is a long-lived animal, and is proportionally &s;low in growing to maturity: he is a helple&s;s being before the age of fifteen or &s;ixteen, and there may be in a family ten or twelve children of different births before the elde&s;t can &s;hift for it&s;elf. Now in the original &s;tate of hunting and fi&s;hing, which are laborious occupations, and not always &s;ucce&s;sful, a woman &s;uckling her infant is not able to provide food even for her&s;elf, far le&s;s for ten or twelve vo|racious children. Matrimony, therefore, or pairing, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the human race, that it mu&s;t be natural and in&s;tinctive. When &s;uch ample means are provided for continuing every other animal race, is it &s;uppo&s;able that the chief race would be neg|lected? Providential care de&s;cends even to vege|table life: every plant bears a profu&s;ion of &s;eed; and in order to cover the earth with vegetables, &s;ome &s;eeds have wings, &s;ome are &s;cattered by means of a &s;pring, and &s;ome are &s;o light as to be carried about by the wind. Brute animals which do not pair, have gra&s;s and other food in plenty, enabling the female to feed her young without needing any help from the male. But where the
<PB N="187" REF="199">
young require the nur&s;ing care of both parents, pairing is a law of nature. When other races are &s;o amply provided for, can it be &s;eriou&s;ly thought, that Providence is le&s;s attentive to the human race? If men and women were not impelled by nature to matrimony, they would be le&s;s fitted for continuing their &s;pecies than even the humble&s;t plant. Have we not rea&s;on fairly to conclude, that matrimony in the human race is an appointment of nature? Can that conclu&s;ion be re&s;i&s;ted by any one who believes in Providence, and in final cau&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears a wi&s;e appointment of Providence, that women give over child-bearing at fifty, while they are &s;till in vigour of mind and body to take care of their offspring. Did the power of procreation continue in women to old age as in men, children would often be left in the wide world, without a mortal to look after them.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>To confirm this doctrine, let the con&s;equences of a loo&s;e commerce between the &s;exes be examin|ed. The carnal appetite, when confined to one object, &s;eldom tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the bounds of tempe|rance. But were it encouraged to roam like a bee &s;ucking honey from every flower, every new object would inflame the imagination; and &s;atiety with re&s;pect to one would give new vigour with re&s;pect to others: a generic habit would be formed of in|temperance in fruition<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, chap. 14.</NOTE>; and animal love would become the ruling pa&s;&s;ion. Men, like the hart in rutting-time, would all the year round fly with impetuo&s;ity from object to object, giving no quar|ter even to women &s;uckling their infants: and women, abandoning them&s;elves to the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, would become altogether regardle&s;s of their off|&s;pring. In that &s;tate, the continuance of the hu|man race would be a miracle. In the &s;avage &s;tate,
<PB N="188" REF="200">
as mentioned above, it is beyond the power of any woman to provide food for a family of children; and now it appears, that intemperance in animal love would render a woman carele&s;s of her family, however ea&s;y it might be to provide for it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have often been tempted to find fault with Pro|vidence in bringing &s;o early to perfection the carnal ap|petite, while a man, &s;till in early youth, has acquired no degree of prudence nor of &s;elf-command. It rages indeed the mo&s;t when young men &s;hould be employ'd in acquiring knowledge, and in fitting them&s;elves for living comfortably in the world. I have &s;et this thought in various lights; but I now perceive that the cen&s;ure is without foundation. The early ripene&s;s of this appe|tite proves it to be the intention of Providence that peo|ple &s;hould early &s;ettle in matrimony. In that &s;tate the appetite is abundantly moderate, and gives no ob&s;truc|tion to education. It never becomes unruly, till one, forgetting the matrimonial tie, wanders from object to object. It is pride and luxury that dictate late marri|ages: indu&s;try never fails to afford the means of living comfortably, provided men confine them&s;elves to the demands of nature.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I &s;ay more: The promi&s;cuous u&s;e of women would unqualify them in a great mea&s;ure from procreating, or having a family. The carnal ap|petite in man re&s;embles his appetite for food: both of them demand gratification without end, after &s;hort intervals. Where the carnal appetite is felt but a &s;hort &s;pace annually, as among animals who feed on gra&s;s, the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of females is according to the order of nature: but &s;uch a law in man, where the carnal appetite is always awake, would be an effectual bar to population; as it is an undoubted truth, that women who indulge that appetite to exce&s;s, &s;eldom have children; and if all women were common, all women would in effect be common pro&s;titutes.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="201">
If undi&s;gui&s;ed nature &s;hows it&s;elf any where, it is in children. So truly is matrimony an in&s;tinct of nature, as to be under&s;tood even by children. They often hear, it is true, people talking of matrimony; but they al&s;o hear of logical, metaphy&s;ical, and commercial matters, without under&s;tanding a &s;yl|lable. Whence then their notion of marriage but from nature? Marriage at the &s;ame time is a com|pound idea, which no in&s;truction could bring with|in the comprehen&s;ion of a child, did not nature co-operate.</P>
<P>That the arguments urged above again&s;t a pro|mi&s;cuous u&s;e of women do not nece&s;&s;arily conclude again&s;t polygamy, or the union of one man with a plurality of women, will not e&s;cape an attentive reader. St. Augu&s;tin and other fathers admit, that polygamy is not prohibited by the law of nature; and the learned Grotius profe&s;&s;es the &s;ame opi|nion<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">De jure belli ac pacis, lib. 2. cap. 5. &sect; 9.</NOTE>. But great names terrify me not; and I venture to maintain, that pairing in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e is a law of nature among men as among wild birds; and that polygamy is a gro&s;s infringement of this law. My rea&s;ons follow.</P>
<P>I urge, in the fir&s;t place, the equal number of males and females, as a clear indication of the will of God, that every man &s;hould be confined to one wife, and every woman to one hu&s;band. That equality which has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in all countries, and at all times, is a &s;ignal in&s;tance of over-ruling Pro|vidence; for the chances again&s;t it are infinite. All men are by nature equal in rank; and every man con&s;equently is equally privileged to have a wife; which cannot be, if polygamy be permitted. Were ten women born for one man, as is fal&s;ely reported to be the ca&s;e in Bantam, polygamy might be the intention of Providence; but from
<PB N="190" REF="202">
the equality of males and females, it is clearly the voice of nature, as well as of the &s;acred &s;cripture, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a man &s;hall leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and that they &s;hall be one fle&s;h."</Q></P>
<P>Con&s;ider, in the next place, that however plau|&s;ible polygamy may appear in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, where inequality of rank and of fortune have produced luxury and &s;en&s;uality; yet that the laws of nature were not contrived by our Maker for a forc'd &s;tate, where numberle&s;s individuals are de|graded below their natural rank, for the benefit of a few who are elevated above it. To form a ju&s;t notion of polygamy, we mu&s;t look back to the original &s;tate of man, where all are equal. In that &s;tate, every man cannot have two wives; and con|&s;equently no man is intitled to more than one, till every other be upon an equal footing with him. At the &s;ame time, the union of one man with one woman is much better calculated for continuing the race, than the union of one man with many wo|men. Think of a &s;avage who may have fifty or &s;ixty children by different wives, all depending for food upon his indu&s;try. Chance mu&s;t turn out much in his favour, if the half of them peri&s;h not by hunger. How much a better chance for life have infants who are di&s;tributed more equally in different families?</P>
<P>Polygamy is attended with an effect &s;till more pernicious, with re&s;pect to children even of the mo&s;t opulent families. Unle&s;s affection be reci|procal and equal, there can be no proper &s;ociety in the matrimonial &s;tate, no cordiality, nor due care of offspring. But &s;uch affection is incon&s;i&s;tent with polygamy: a woman in that &s;tate, far from being a companion to her hu&s;band, is degraded to the rank of a &s;ervant, a mere in&s;trument of plea&s;ure and propagation. Among many wives there will
<PB N="191" REF="203">
always be a favourite: the re&s;t turn peevi&s;h; and if they re&s;ent not the injury again&s;t their hu&s;band, and again&s;t their children as belonging to him, will at lea&s;t be di&s;heartened, and neglect them altoge|ther. At the &s;ame time, fondne&s;s for the favourite wife and her children makes the hu&s;band indifferent about the re&s;t; and woful is the condition of chil|dren who are neglected by both parents<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">L'e&s;prit des loix, liv. 16. chap. 6.</NOTE>. To produce &s;uch an effect is certainly not the purpo&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>It merits peculiar attention, that Providence has provided for an agreeable union among all creatures who are taught by nature to pair. Animal love, among creatures who pair not, is confined within a narrow &s;pace of time: while the dam is occupied about her young, animal love lies dormant, that &s;he may not be ab&s;tracted from her duty. In pair|ing animals, on the contrary, animal love is always awake: frequent enjoyment endears a pair to each other, and makes con&s;tancy a plea&s;ure. Such is the ca&s;e of the human race; and &s;uch is the ca&s;e of wild birds<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Buffon, liv. 5. p. 359. octavo edition.</NOTE>. Among the wild birds that build on trees, the male, after feeding his mate in the ne&s;t, plants him&s;elf upon the next &s;pray, and chears her with a &s;ong. There is &s;till greater plea&s;ure pro|vided for the human race in the matrimonial &s;tate, and &s;tronger incitements to con&s;tancy. Sweet is the &s;ociety of a pair fitted for each other, in whom are collected the affections of hu&s;band, wife, lover, friend, the tendere&s;t affections of human nature. Public government is in perfection, when the &s;o|vereign commands with humanity, and the &s;ubjects are cordial in their obedience. Private government in conjugal &s;ociety arrives at &s;till greater perfection, where hu&s;band and wife govern and are governed
<PB N="192" REF="204">
reciprocally, with entire &s;atisfaction to both. The man bears rule over his wife's per&s;on and conduct; &s;he bears rule over his inclinations: he governs by law; and &s;he by per&s;ua&s;ion.

The God of nature has enforc'd conjugal &s;ociety, not only by making it agreeable, but by the prin|ciple of cha&s;tity inherent in our nature. To ani|mals that have no in&s;tinct for pairing, cha&s;tity is utterly unknown; and to them it would be u&s;ele&s;s. The mare, the cow, the ewe, the &s;he-goat, receive the male without ceremony, and admit the fir&s;t that comes in the way without di&s;tinction. Neither have tame fowl any notion of cha&s;tity: they pair not; and the female gets no food from the male, even during incubation. But cha&s;tity and mutual fidelity are e&s;&s;ential to all pairing animals; for wan|dering inclinations would render them negligent in nur&s;ing their young. Wild birds pair; and they are by in&s;tinct faithful to each other while their young require nurture. Cha&s;tity and mutual fide|lity in matrimony are equally e&s;&s;ential to the human race, and equally enforc'd by the principle of cha&s;|tity, a branch of the moral &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor is cha&s;tity confined to the matrimonial &s;tate. Matrimony is in&s;tituted by nature for continuing the &s;pecies; and it is the duty of man to ab&s;tain from animal enjoyment except in that &s;tate. The ceremonies of marriage, and the cau&s;es of &s;eparation and divorce, are &s;ubjected to municipal law: but if a man beget children, it is his duty to unite with the mother in taking care of them; and &s;uch union is matrimony according to the law of nature. Hence it is, that the fir&s;t acts of incontinence, where en|joyment only is in view, are always attended with &s;hame, and with a degree of remor&s;e. At the &s;ame time, as cha&s;tity in per&s;ons who are &s;ingle is only a
<PB N="194" REF="206">
&s;elf-duty, it is not &s;o &s;trongly enforc'd by the moral &s;en&s;e as cha&s;tity is in married per&s;ons, who owe to each other mutual fidelity. Deviations accord|ingly from the former make a le&s;s figure than from the latter: we &s;carce ever hear of adultery among &s;avages: tho' among them incontinence before marriage is not uncommon. In Wales, even at pre&s;ent, and in the highlands of Scotland, it is &s;carce a di&s;grace for a young woman to have a ba&s;tard. In the country la&s;t mentioned, the fir&s;t in&s;tance known of a ba&s;tard-child being de&s;troy'd by its mother through &s;hame is a late one. The virtue of cha&s;tity appears to be there gaining ground; as the only temptation a woman can have to de&s;troy her child is, to conceal her frailty. The principle of cha&s;tity, like that of propriety or of decency, is but faint among &s;avages, and has little of that authority which it acquires among poli&s;hed nations before they are corrupted by luxury. We &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ee afterward, that even the great duty of ju&s;tice is but faint among barbarians, and yields too readily to every irregular impul&s;e, till the moral &s;en&s;e acquires full maturity. Bou|gainville reports, that in the i&s;land of Otaheite, or King George's i&s;land, a young woman is free to follow her inclinations; and that her having had many lovers gives her not the le&s;s chance for a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Cha&s;tity is no doubt a re&s;traint upon nature; and therefore, if &s;hame be removed, by making it law|ful to obey the appetite, nature will prevail. In the year 1707, a contagious di&s;temper having car|ried off a large proportion of the inhabitants of Iceland, the King of Denmark fell on a device to re-people the country, which &s;ucceeded to a wi&s;h. A law was made, authori&s;ing young women in that i&s;land to have ba&s;tards, even to the number of &s;ix,

<P>Mode&s;ty is by nature intended to guard cha&s;tity, as cha&s;tity is to guard matrimony. And mode&s;ty, like cha&s;tity, is one of tho&s;e delicate principles that make no great figure among &s;avages. In the land of Je&s;&s;o, young women &s;ometimes go naked in &s;ummer: if, however, they meet a &s;tranger, they hang the head, and turn away through &s;hame.

Regnard reports, upon his own knowledge, that in Lapland, man, woman, and child, take the hot bath promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and are not a&s;hamed to be &s;een in that condition, even by a &s;tranger. As this appeared &s;ingular, I took opportunity to mention it to Dr. Solander, who made more than one vi&s;it to that country. He &s;aid, that Regnard's report might be true, but without any imputation on the mode&s;ty of the Laplanders; for that their place of bathing is always &s;o dark, that nothing can be &s;een. He added, that the females in Lapland, both mar|ried and unmarried, are extremely cha&s;te.

The women of New Zeland are both cha&s;te and mode&s;t. In Lieutenant Cook's Voyage Round the World, it is reported, that he &s;tumbled upon &s;ome of them naked, &s;earch|ing for lob&s;ters in the &s;ea; and that they were in great confu&s;ion for being &s;een in this condition by &s;trangers.</P>
<P>But now, if pairing in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e be a law of nature among men, as among &s;ome other animals, how is polygamy to be accounted for, which formerly was univer&s;al, and to this day ob|tains among many nations? I am reduced to no dilemma here. Polygamy is derived from two &s;ources; fir&s;t, from &s;avage manners, once univer|&s;al; and next, from voluptuou&s;ne&s;s in warm cli|mates, which in&s;tigates men of wealth to tran&s;gre&s;s every rule of temperance. The&s;e two &s;ources I propo&s;e to handle with care, becau&s;e they make a great part of the hi&s;tory of the female &s;ex.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, &s;weetne&s;s of temper, a capital branch of the female character, di&s;plays it&s;elf externally, by mild looks, and gentle manners. But &s;uch graces are &s;carce perceptible in a female &s;avage; and even in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed would not be perceived by a male &s;avage. Among &s;avages, &s;trength and boldne&s;s are the only valued qualities: in the&s;e qualities females are mi&s;erably deficient; and for that rea&s;on are contemned by the males, as beings of an inferior order. The North-Ame|rican tribes glory in idlene&s;s: the drudgery of la|bour degrades a man in their opinion, and is proper for women only. To join young per&s;ons in mar|riage is accordingly the bu&s;ine&s;s of parents; and it would be unpardonable meanne&s;s in the bridegroom to &s;hew any fondne&s;s for the bride. Young men

<PB N="198" REF="210">
that tyrannical treatment of wives is far from being eradicated.</P>
<P>The low condition of the female &s;ex among &s;a|vages and barbarians paved the way to polygamy. Savages, excited by a ta&s;te for variety, and &s;till more by pride, which is gratified by many &s;ervants, delight in a multiplicity of wives. The pairing principle, tho' rooted in human nature, makes little figure among &s;avages, yielding to every irregular appetite; and this fairly accounts why polygamy was once univer&s;al. It might indeed be thought, that animal love, were there nothing el&s;e, &s;hould have rai&s;ed women to &s;ome degree of e&s;timation among the men. But male &s;avages, utter &s;trangers to decency or refinement, gratify animal love with as little ceremony as they do hunger or thir&s;t.</P>
<P>Hence appears the rea&s;on of a cu&s;tom that will &s;urpri&s;e tho&s;e who are unacquainted with ancient cu&s;toms; which is, that women are purcha&s;ed for wives, as other goods are purcha&s;ed. Women by marriage became &s;laves; and no man will give away his daughter to be a &s;lave, but for a valuable con&s;ideration. The practice was univer&s;al. I be|gin with the Jews.

Agamemnon offers his daughter to Achilles for a wife, and &s;ays, that he would not demand for her any price. Pau&s;anias reports of Danaus, that no &s;uitors appearing to demand any of his daughters, he publi&s;hed, that he would give them without dowry. In Homer there is frequent mention of nuptial gifts from a bridegroom to his bride's father. From terming them gifts, it is probable that the former method of purcha&s;e was beginning to wear out. It wore out before the time of Ari&s;totle, who infers, that their fore-fathers mu&s;t have been a very rude people. The ancient Spaniards purcha&s;ed their wives. We have the authority of Herodotus and of Heraclides Ponticus, that the &s;ame was practi&s;ed in Thrace. And the latter adds, that if a wife was ill treated, her relations could demand her back, upon repaying the price they got for her. In the Roman law mention is made of matrimony per aes et libram, which was &s;olemnized by laying down a quantity of bra&s;s, with a balance for weighing it, under&s;tood to be the price paid for the bride. This mu&s;t have been once a reality, tho' it &s;unk down to be a mere ceremony, after it became cu&s;tomary for a Roman bride to bring a dowry with her. The Babylonians and the A&s;&s;yrians, at &s;tated times, collected all the marriageable young women, and di&s;po&s;ed of them by auction. Rubruguis, in his voyage to Tartary, ann. 1253, reports, that there every man bought his wife. They believe, he adds, that their wives &s;erve them in another world as they do in this; for which rea&s;on, a widow has no chance for a &s;econd hu&s;band, whom &s;he cannot &s;erve in the other world. Olaus Magnus remark|ing, that among the ancient Goths no dower was provided on the bride's part, gives a rea&s;on, better &s;uited perhaps to the time he lived in than to what he de&s;cribes. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Apud Gothos, non mulier viro &s;ed vir mulieri dotem a&s;&s;ignat; ne conjux, ob

Giraldus Cambren&s;is, in his de&s;cription of Wales, &s;ays, that formerly they hardly ever married with|out a prior cohabitation, it having been cu&s;tomary for parents to let out their daughters to young men upon trial, for a &s;um of money told down, and under a penalty if the girls were returned. This I believe to be a mi&s;take. It is more probable, that in Wales men purcha&s;ed their wives, as was done all the world over, with liberty to return them if they proved not agreeable. The bride's parents retained the dowry, and her chance for a hu&s;band was as good as ever.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cu&s;tom continues among barbarous nations. It continues among the Tartars, among the Mingrelians, among the Samoides, among the O&s;tiacs, among the people of Pegu, and of the Molucca i&s;lands. In Timor, an Ea&s;t-Indian i&s;land, men even &s;ell their children to purcha&s;e more wives. The Prince of Circa&s;&s;ia demanded from the Prince of Mingrelia, who was in &s;uit of his daughter, a hundred &s;laves loaded with tape&s;try and other hou&s;ehold furniture, a hundred cows, as many oxen, and as many hor&s;es. We have evidence of the &s;ame cu&s;tom in Africa, particularly in Biledul|gerid, among the negroes on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and in Monomotapa. Among the Caribbees there is one in&s;tance where a man gets a wife without paying for her. After a &s;ucce&s;sful war, the victors are
<PB N="201" REF="213">
entertained at a fea&s;t, where the General harangues on the valour of the young men who made the be&s;t figure. Every man who has marriageable daugh|ters, is fond to offer them to &s;uch young men without any price. The purcha&s;ing of wives is univer&s;al among the wild Arabs. When the bar|gain is concluded, the bridegroom is permitted to vi&s;it the bride: if &s;he an&s;wer not his expectations, he may turn her off; but has no claim for the price he paid. The inland negroes are more po|li&s;hed than tho&s;e on the coa&s;t; and there is &s;carce any remains among them of purcha&s;ing wives: the bridegroom makes pre&s;ents to his bride, and her father makes pre&s;ents to him. There are remaining traces in Ru&s;&s;ia of purcha&s;ing wives. Even &s;o late as the time of Peter I. the Ru&s;&s;ians married without &s;eeing each other; and before &s;olemnization the bride received from the bridegroom a pre&s;ent of &s;weetmeats, &s;oap, and other little things.</P>
<P>The purcha&s;ing of wives made it a lawful prac|tice to lend a wife as one does a &s;lave. The Spar|tans lent their wives to their friends; and Cato the elder is &s;aid to have done the &s;ame. The Indians of Calicut frequently exchange wives.</P>
<P>If bruti&s;h manners alone be &s;ufficient to degrade the female &s;ex, they may reckon upon extreme har&s;h treatment when purcha&s;ed to be &s;laves. The Giagas, a fierce and wandering nation in the cen|tral parts of Africa, being &s;upinely idle at home, &s;ubject their wives and their &s;laves to every &s;ort of drudgery, &s;uch as digging, &s;owing, reaping, cut|ting wood, grinding corn, fetching water, &amp;c. The&s;e poor creatures are &s;uffered to toil in the fields and woods, ready to faint with exce&s;&s;ive labour, while the mon&s;ters of men will not give them&s;elves even the trouble of training animals for work, tho' they have the example of the Portugue&s;e before their eyes. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the women among

the wandering Arabs of Africa to card, &s;pin, and weave, and to manage other hou&s;ehold affairs. They milk the cattle, grind, bake, brew, dre&s;s the victuals, and bring home wood and water. They even take care of their hu&s;bands hor&s;es, feed, curry, comb, bridle, and faddle them. They would al&s;o be obliged, like Moori&s;h wives, to dig, &s;ow, and reap their corn; but luckily for them the Arabs live entirely upon plunder. Father Jo&s;eph Gu|milla, in his account of a country in South Ame|rica, bordering upon the great river Oroonoko, de&s;cribes pathetically the mi&s;erable &s;lavery of mar|ried women there, and mentions a practice that would appear incredible to one unacquainted with the manners of that country, which is, that mar|ried women frequently de&s;troy their female infants. A married woman, of a virtuous character and good under&s;tanding, having been guilty of that crime, was reproached by our author in bitter terms. She heard him patiently to an end, with eyes fixed on the ground; and an&s;wered as follows. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I wi&s;h to God, Father, I wi&s;h to God, that my mother had by my death prevented the manifold di&s;tre&s;&s;es I have endured, and have yet to endure as long as I live.

<P>Nations poli&s;h by degrees; and from the lowe&s;t &s;tate to which a human creature can be reduced, women came in time to be re&s;tored to their native dignity. Attention to dre&s;s is the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of that progre&s;s. Male &s;avages, even of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t kind, are fond of dre&s;s. Charlevoix mentions a young American hired as a rower, who adju&s;ted his dre&s;s with great care before he entered the boat; and at intervals in&s;pected his looking-gla&s;s, to &s;ee whether the violence of his motion had not di&s;com|po&s;ed the red upon his cheeks. We read not of vanity &s;or dre&s;s in females of &s;uch &s;avage nations: they are too much di&s;pirited to think of being agree|able. Among nations in any degree humanized we find a different &s;cene. In the i&s;thmus of Darien government has made &s;ome progre&s;s, as a chieftain is elected for life: a glimmering of civility appears among the inhabitants; and as &s;ome regard is paid to women, they rival the men in dre&s;s. Both &s;exes wear rings in their ears and no&s;es; and are adorned with many rows of &s;hells hanging down from the
<PB N="204" REF="216">
neck. A female in a &s;ultry climate &s;ubmits to fry all day long under a load of twenty or thirty pounds of &s;hells; and a male under double that load. Well may they exclaim with Alexander, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh Athe|nians! what do I not endure to gain your ap|probation?"</Q> The female Caribbeans and Bra&s;i|lians are not le&s;s fond of ornament than the males. Hottentot ladies are fond of dre&s;s; and &s;trive to out-do each other in adorning their kro&s;&s;es, and the bag that holds their pipe and tobacco: Euro|pean ladies are not more vain of their &s;ilks and em|broideries. Women in Lapland are much addicted to finery. They wear broad girdles, upon which hang chains and rings without end, commonly made of tin, &s;ometimes of &s;ilver, weighing perhaps twenty pounds. The Greenlanders are na&s;ty and &s;lovenly, eat with their dogs, make food of the vermin that make food of them, &s;eldom or never wa&s;h them&s;elves; and yet the women, who make &s;ome figure among the men, are gaudy in their dre&s;s. Their chief ornaments are pendents at their ears, with gla&s;s beads of various colours; and they draw lines with a needle and black thread between their eyes, cro&s;s the forehead, upon the chin, hands, and legs. The negroes of the kingdom of Ardrah in Guinea have made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in po|lice, and in the art of living. Their women carry dre&s;s and finery to an extravagance. They are cloathed with loads of the fine&s;t &s;atins and chintzes, and are adorned with a profu&s;ion of gold. In a fultry climate they gratify vanity at the expence of ea&s;e. Among the inland negroes, who are more poli&s;hed than tho&s;e on the&s;e a-coa&s;t, be&s;ide dome&s;tic concerns, the women &s;ow, plant, and reap. A man however &s;uffers in the e&s;teem of the world, if he permits his wives to toil like &s;laves while he is in|dulging in ea&s;e. From that au&s;picious commence|ment, the female &s;ex have ri&s;en in a &s;low but &s;teady
<PB N="205" REF="217">
progre&s;s to higher and higher degrees of e&s;timation. Conver&s;ation is their talent, and a di&s;play of delicate &s;entiments: the gentlene&s;s of their manners, and winning behaviour, captivate every &s;en&s;ible heart. Of &s;uch refinements &s;avages have little conception: but when the more delicate &s;en&s;es are unfolded, the peculiar beauties of the female &s;ex, internal as well as external, are brought into full light; and wo|men, formerly con&s;idered as objects of animal love merely, are now valued as faithful friends and agree|able companions. Matrimony a&s;&s;umes a more de|cent form, being the union, not of a ma&s;ter and &s;lave, but of two per&s;ons equal in rank uniting to form a family. And it contributed greatly to this delicious refinement, that in temperate climes ani|mal love is moderate, and women long retain good looks, and power of procreation. Thus mar|riage became honourable among poli&s;hed nations; which of cour&s;e bani&s;hed the barbarous cu&s;tom of purcha&s;ing wives; for a man who wi&s;hes to have his daughter properly matched, will gladly give a dowry with her, in&s;tead of &s;elling her as a &s;lave.</P>
<P>Polygamy is found intimately connected with the purcha&s;ing wives. There is no limitation in pur|cha&s;ing &s;laves: nor has a woman, purcha&s;ed as a wife or a &s;lave, any ju&s;t cau&s;e for complaining, that others are purcha&s;ed as &s;he was: on the contrary, &s;he is in part relieved, by addition of hands for per|forming the &s;ervile offices of the family. Polygamy accordingly has always been permitted, where men pay for their wives. The Jews purcha&s;ed their wives, and were indulged in polygamy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Leviticus, xviii. 18.</NOTE>. Diodo|rus Siculus &s;ays, that polygamy was permitted in Egypt, except to prie&s;ts<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1.</NOTE>. This probably was the ca&s;e originally; but when the Egyptian man|ners
<PB N="206" REF="218">
came to be poli&s;hed, a man gave a dowry with his daughter, in&s;tead of receiving a price for her; witne&s;s Solomon, who got the city of Gazer in dowry with the king of Egypt's daughter. When that cu&s;tom became univer&s;al, we may be certain that it would put an end to polygamy. And ac|cordingly Herodotus affirms, that polygamy was prohibited in Egypt<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. &sect; 92.</NOTE>. Polygamy undoubtedly prevailed in Greece and Rome, while it was cu&s;to|mary to purcha&s;e wives; but improved manners put an end to the latter, and con&s;equently to the former. Polygamy to this day obtains in the cold country of Kam&s;katka; and in the &s;till colder country round Hud&s;on's bay. In the land of Je&s;&s;o, near Japan, a man may have two wives, who perform every &s;ort of dome&s;tic drudgery. The negroes in general pur|cha&s;e their wives, and deal in polygamy. Polyga|my is the law in Monomotapa. Polygamy and the purcha&s;ing wives were cu&s;tomary among the origi|nal inhabitants of the Canary i&s;lands. The men in Chili buy their wives, and deal in polygamy.</P>
<P>The low condition of women among barbarians introduced polygamy, and the purcha&s;ing women to be wives. And the ju&s;t re&s;pect paid to them among civilized nations, re&s;tored the law of nature, and confined a man to one wife. Their equality as to rank and dignity bars the man from taking another wife, as it bars the woman from taking another hu&s;band. We find traces in ancient hi&s;tory of polygamy wearing out gradually. It wore out in Greece, as manners refined; but &s;uch was the influence of long habit, that tho' a man was con|fined to one wife, concubines were indulged with|out limitation. In Germany, when Tacitus wrote, very few traces remained of polygamy. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Severa illic matrimonia, nec ullam morum partem ma|gis laudaveris: nam prope &s;oli barbarorum &s;ingu|lis

In Siam, polygamy is &s;till permitted, though the bride brings a dowry with her: but that ab&s;urdity is corrected by refined manners; it being held improper, and even di&s;|graceful, to have more than one wife. The pur|cha&s;ing wives wore out of fa&s;hion among the anci|ent Tu&s;cans; for it was held infamous, that mar|riage &s;hould be the re&s;ult of any motive but mutual love. This at the &s;ame time put an end to poly|gamy. Polygamy was probably early eradicated among the ancient Per&s;ians; for the bride's dowry was &s;ettled in marriage-articles, as among us. And there is the &s;ame rea&s;on for pre&s;uming, that it was not long permitted in Mexico; marriage there be|ing &s;olemnized by the prie&s;t, and the bride's dower &s;pecified, which was re&s;tored in ca&s;e of a &s;eparation. In the countries where the Chri&s;tian religion was fir&s;t propagated, women were fa&s;t advancing to an equality with the men, and polygamy was wearing out of fa&s;hion. The pure &s;pirit of the go&s;pel ha&s;|tened its downfal; and though not prohibited expre&s;sly, it was, however, held, that Chri&s;tianity is a religion too pure for polygamy.</P>
<P>But, as hinted above, it was by &s;low degrees that the female &s;ex emerged out of &s;lavery, to po&s;|&s;e&s;s the elevated &s;tate they ju&s;tly are intitled to by nature. The practice of expo&s;ing infants among the Greeks, and many other nations, is an invinci|ble proof of their depre&s;&s;ion, even after the cu&s;tom cea&s;ed of purcha&s;ing them. It is wi&s;ely ordered by Providence, that the affection of a woman to her children commences with their birth, becau&s;e, dur|ing infancy, all depends on her care. As, during that period, the father is of little u&s;e to his child, his affection is extremely &s;light till the child begins to prattle and &s;hew &s;ome fondne&s;s for him. The ex|po&s;ing an infant, therefore, &s;hows, that the mother was little regarded: if &s;he had been allowed a vote,
<PB N="209" REF="221">
the practice never would have obtained in any country.

At that rate, had it fallen to his &s;hare to de&s;cribe Julius Cae&s;ar, he would have dre&s;&s;ed him like a modern beau.

Married women in their comedies are &s;ometimes introduced, and treated with very little re&s;pect. A man commonly

<P>One will not be &s;urpri&s;ed, that women in Greece were treated with no great re&s;pect by their hu&s;bands. A woman cannot have much attraction who pa&s;&s;es all her time in &s;olitude: to be admired, &s;he mu&s;t receive the high poli&s;h of &s;ociety. At the &s;ame time, men of fa&s;hion were &s;o much improved in manners as to reli&s;h &s;ociety with agreeable women, where &s;uch could be found. And hence the figure that courtezans made at that period, e&s;pecially in Athens. They &s;tudied the temper and ta&s;te of the men, and endeavoured to gain their affection by every winning art. The daily conver&s;ations they li&s;tened to on philo&s;ophy, politics, poetry, enlight|ened their under&s;tanding and improved their ta&s;te. Their hou&s;es became agreeable &s;chools, where eve|ry one might be in&s;tructed in his own arts. Socrates and Pericles met frequently at the hou&s;e of A&s;pa&s;ia: from her they acquired delicacy of ta&s;te, and in re|turn procured to her public re&s;pect and reputation.
<PB N="211" REF="223">
Greece at that time was governed by orators, over whom &s;ome celebrated courtezans had great influ|ence, and by that means entered deep into the government. It was &s;aid of the famous Demo&s;thenes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The mea&s;ure he hath meditated on for a year, will be overturned in a day by a woman."</Q> It appears accordingly from Plautus and Terence, that Athenian courtezans lived in great &s;plendor. See in particular Theautontimorumenos, act 3. &s;cene 2.</P>
<P>I proceed to the other cau&s;e of polygamy, men|tioned al&s;o above, viz. opulence in a hot climate. Men there have a burning appetite for animal en|joyment; and women become old and lo&s;e the prolific quality, not long after the age of maturity in a temperate climate. The&s;e circum&s;tances di&s;|po&s;e men of opulence to purcha&s;e their wives, that they may not be confined to one; and purcha&s;e they mu&s;t, for no man, without a valuable con&s;ideration, will &s;urrender his daughter to be one of many who are de&s;tined to gratify the carnal appetite of one man. The numerous wives and concubines in A&s;i|atic harems are all of them purcha&s;ed with money. In the hot climate of Hindo&s;tan, polygamy is uni|ver&s;al, and men buy their wives. The &s;ame obtains in China: after the price is adju&s;ted and paid, the bride is conducted to the bride-groom's hou&s;e locked in a &s;edan, and the key delivered to him: if he be not &s;atisfied with his bargain, he &s;ends her back at the expence of lo&s;ing the &s;um he paid for her: if &s;atisfied, he fea&s;ts his male friends in one room, and &s;he her female friends in another. A man who has little &s;ub&s;tance takes a wife for his &s;on from an ho&s;|pital, which &s;aves him a dowry.</P>
<P>It has been pleaded for polygamy in warm cli|mates, that women are fit for being married at or before the age of ten, and pa&s;t child-bearing at twenty-five, while men are yet in the prime of life; and therefore that a &s;econd wife ought to be
<PB N="212" REF="224">
permitted, who can bear children. Is then the in|tere&s;t of the female &s;ex to be totally di&s;regarded in the matrimonial engagement, as if women were intended by nature for bea&s;ts of burden only? But even putting them out of the que&s;tion, it ought to be con&s;idered, that a man, by taking a &s;econd wife, deprives &s;ome other of the privilege all men have to be married. The argument, indeed, would be con|clu&s;ive, were ten females born for one male, as is &s;aid to be the ca&s;e in Bantam: but as an equality of males and females is the de&s;tination of nature, the argument has no force. All men are born equal by nature; and to permit polygamy in any degree, is to authori&s;e &s;ome to u&s;urp the privilege of others.</P>
<P>Thus in hot climates women remain in the &s;ame humble and dependent &s;tate, in which all women were originally, when all men were &s;avages. Wo|men by the law of Hindo&s;tan are not admitted to be witne&s;&s;es, even in a civil cau&s;e; and I blu&s;h to ac|knowledge, that in Scotland the &s;ame law has not been long in di&s;u&s;e.</P>
<P>In contradiction to the climate, Chri&s;tianity has bani&s;hed polygamy from Ethiopia, though the judges are far from being &s;evere upon that crime. The heat of the climate makes them wi&s;h to indulge in a plurality of wives, even at the expence of pur|cha&s;ing each of them. Among the Chri&s;tians of Congo polygamy is in u&s;e, as formerly when they were Pagans. To be confined to one wife during life, is held by the mo&s;t zealous Chri&s;tians there, to be altogether irrational: rather than be &s;o con|fined, they would renounce Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide polygamy, many other cu&s;toms depend on the nature of the matrimonial engagement, and va|ry according to its different kinds. Marriage-cere|monies, for that rea&s;on, vary in different countries, and at different times. Where the practice is to purcha&s;e a wife, whether among &s;avages, or among
<PB N="213" REF="225">
pampered people in hot climates, the payment of the price completes the marriage, without any other ceremony. Other ceremonies, however, are &s;ometimes practi&s;ed. In old Rome, the bride was attended to the bridegroom's hou&s;e with a female &s;lave carrying a di&s;taff and a &s;pindle, importing that &s;he ought to &s;pin for the family. Among the &s;avages of Canada and of the neighbouring countries, a &s;trap, a kettle, and a faggot, are put in the bride's cabin, as &s;ymbols of her duty, viz. to carry bur|dens, to dre&s;s the victuals, and to provide wood. On the other hand, the bride, in token of her &s;la|very, takes her axe, cuts down timber, bundles it up, and lays it before the door of the bridegroom's hut. All the &s;alutation &s;he receives is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is time to go to re&s;t."</Q> The inhabitants of Sierra Leona, a negro country, have in all their towns a boarding|&s;chool, where young ladies are educated for a year under the care of a venerable old gentleman. When their education is completed, they are carried in their be&s;t attire to a public a&s;&s;embly; which may be termed a matrimonial market, becau&s;e there young men convene to make a choice. Tho&s;e who fit them&s;elves to their fancy, pay the dowry, and over and above gratify the old &s;uperintendent for his extraordinary care in educating the bride. In the i&s;land of Java, the bride, in token of &s;ubjecti|on, wa&s;hes the bridegroom's feet; and this is a capital ceremony. In Ru&s;&s;ia, the bride pre&s;ents to the bridegroom a bundle of rods, to be u&s;ed again&s;t her when &s;he de&s;erves to be cha&s;ti&s;ed; and at the &s;ame time &s;he pulls off his boots. The pre&s;ent Em|pre&s;s, prone to reform the rude manners of her &s;ub|jects, has di&s;countenanced that ceremony among people of fa&s;hion. Very different were the man|ners of Peru before the Spani&s;h conque&s;t. The bridegroom carried &s;hoes to the bride, and put them on with his own hands. But there purcha&s;ing of
<PB N="214" REF="226">
wives was unknown. Marriage-ceremonies in Lap|land are directed by the &s;ame principle. It is the cu&s;tom there for a man to make pre&s;ents to his chil|dren of rein-deer, and young women, &s;uch as have a large &s;tock of rein-deer, have lovers in plenty. A young man looks for &s;uch a wife at a fair, or at their meetings for paying taxes. He carries to the hou&s;e of the young woman's parents, &s;ome of his relati|ons; being &s;olicitous in particular to chu&s;e an elo|quent &s;peaker. They are all admitted except the lover, who mu&s;t wait till he be called in After drinking &s;ome &s;pirits, brought along for the pur|po&s;e, the &s;poke&s;man addre&s;&s;es the father in the mo&s;t humble terms, bowing the knee as if he were in|troduced to a prince. He &s;tyles him, the wor&s;hip|ful father, the high and mighty father, the be&s;t and mo&s;t illu&s;trious father, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>In viewing the chain of cau&s;es and effects, in|&s;tances &s;ometimes occur of bizarre facts, &s;tarting from the chain without any cau&s;e that can be di&s;|covered. The marriage-ceremonies among the Hottentots are of that nature. After all matters are adju&s;ted among the old people, the young cou|ple are &s;hut up in a room by them&s;elves, where they pa&s;s the night in &s;truggling for &s;uperiority, which proves a very &s;erious work where the bride is reluctant. If &s;he per&s;evere to the la&s;t without yielding, the young man is di&s;carded; but if he prevail, which commonly happens, the marriage is completed by another ceremony, not le&s;s &s;ingular. The men and women &s;quat on the ground in diffe|rent circles, the bridegroom in the centre of one, and the bride in the centre of another. The Suri, or ma&s;ter of religious ceremonies, pi&s;&s;es on the bride|groom; who receives the &s;tream with eagerne&s;s, and rubs it into the furrows of the fat with which he is covered. He performs the &s;ame ceremony on the bride, who is equally re&s;pectful. Marriage-ceremonies among the Kam&s;katkans are &s;till more
<PB N="215" REF="227">
whim&s;ical. A young man, after making his pro|po&s;als, enters into the &s;ervice of his intended father-in-law. If he prove agreeable, he is admitted to the trial of the touch. The young woman is &s;wad|dled up in leathern thongs; and in that condition is put under the guard of &s;ome old women. He watches every opportunity of a &s;lack guard to unca&s;e her, in order to touch what is always the mo&s;t concealed. The bride mu&s;t re&s;i&s;t, in appearance at lea&s;t; and therefore cries out to &s;ummon her guards; who fall with fury upon the bridegroom, tear his hair, &s;cratch his face, and act in violent oppo&s;ition. The attempts of the lover prove &s;ometimes un&s;ucce&s;sful for months; but the moment the touch is atchiev|ed, the bride te&s;tifies her &s;atisfaction, by pronoun|cing the words Ni, Ni, with a &s;oft and loving voice. The next night they bed together without any op|po&s;ition. One marriage-ceremony among the in|land negroes is &s;ingular. So &s;oon as preliminaries are adju&s;ted, the bridegroom with a number of his companions &s;et out at night, and &s;urround the hou&s;e of the bride, as if intending to carry her off by force. She and her female attendants, pretending to make all po&s;&s;ible re&s;i&s;tance, cry aloud for help, but no per&s;on appears. This re&s;embles &s;trongly a marriage-ceremony that is or was cu&s;tomary in Wales. On the morning of the wedding-day, the bridegroom, accompanied with his friends on hor&s;e|back, demands the bride. Her friends, who are likewi&s;e on hor&s;eback, give a po&s;itive refu&s;al, upon which a mock &s;cufflle en&s;ues. The bride, mounted behind her next kin&s;man, is carried off, and is pur|&s;ued by the bridegroom and his friends with loud &s;houts. It is not uncommon to &s;ee on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion two or three hundred &s;turdy Cambro-Britons riding at full &s;peed, cro&s;&s;ing and jo&s;tling, to the no &s;mall amu&s;ement of the &s;pectators. When they have fatigued them&s;elves and their hor&s;es, the bride|groom
<PB N="216" REF="228">
is &s;uffered to overtake his bride. He leads her away in triumph, and the &s;cene is concluded with fea&s;ting and fe&s;tivity. The &s;ame marriage-ceremony was u&s;ual in Mu&s;covy, Lithuania, and Livonia, as reported by Olaus Magnus<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Lib. 14. cap. 9</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Divorce al&s;o depends on the nature of the ma|trimonial engagement. Where the law is, that a man mu&s;t purcha&s;e his wife as one does a &s;lave; it follows naturally, that he may purcha&s;e as many as he can pay for, and that he may turn them off at his plea&s;ure. This law is univer&s;al, without a &s;ingle exception. The Jews, who purcha&s;ed their wives, were privileged to divorce them, without being obliged to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Deuteronomy, chap. xxiv.</NOTE>. The negroes purcha&s;e their wives, and turn them off when they think proper. The &s;ame law obtains in China, in Monomotapa, in the I&s;thmus of Darien, in Cari|beana, and even in the cold country round Hud|&s;on's Bay. All the &s;avages of South America, who live near the Oroonoko, purcha&s;e as many wives as they can maintain; and divorce them at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Very different is a matrimonial engagement be|tween equals, where a dowry is contracted with the bride. The nature of the engagement implies, that neither of them is privileged to di&s;mi&s;s the other without a ju&s;t cau&s;e. In Mexico, where the bride brought a dowry, there could be no divorce but by mutual con&s;ent. In Lapland, the women who have a &s;tock of rein-deer, as above-mentioned, make a con&s;iderable figure. This lays a foundation for a matrimonial covenant as among us, which bars polygamy, and, con&s;equently, divorce, with|out a ju&s;t cau&s;e. And when the&s;e are barred in &s;e|veral
<PB N="217" REF="229">
in&s;tances, the prohibition in time becomes general.</P>
<P>I proceed to adultery, the criminality of which depends al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure on the nature of the matrimonial engagement. Where wives are pur|cha&s;ed, and polygamy is indulged, adultery can &s;carce be reckoned a crime in the hu&s;band; and where there are a plurality of wives, &s;ound &s;en&s;e makes it but a venial crime in any one of them. But, as men are the lawgivers, the puni&s;hment of female adultery, where polygamy takes place, is generally too &s;evere. It is, however, more or le&s;s &s;evere in different countries, in proportion as the men are more or le&s;s prone to revenge. The Chi|ne&s;e are a mild people, and depend more on locks and bars for preventing adultery, than on &s;everity; the puni&s;hment being only to &s;ell an adultere&s;s for a &s;lave. The &s;ame law obtains in the kingdom of Laos, bordering upon China. An adultere&s;s among the ancient Egyptians was puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of her no&s;e. In ancient Greece, a pecuniary penalty was inflicted on an adulterer<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ody&s;&s;ey, book 8. l. 384.</NOTE>. An adultere&s;s was probably puni&s;hed more &s;everely. Among the ne|groes, who have very little delicacy, adultery is but &s;lightly puni&s;hed; except in the kingdom of Benin. There an adultere&s;s, after a &s;evere whip|ping, is bani&s;hed; and the adulterer forfeits his goods, which are be&s;towed on the injured hu&s;band. Among the ancient Germans, a grave and virtuous people, adultery was extremely rare. An adulte|re&s;s was deprived of her hair, expelled from her hu&s;band's hou&s;e, and whipped through the vil|lage<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Tacitus, De Moribus Germanorum, cap. 19.</NOTE>.

Margaret of Burgundy, Queen to Lewis Hutin, King of France, was hanged for adultery; and her lovers were flead alive. Such were the &s;avage manners of tho&s;e times. There is an old law in Wales, that for defiling the prince's bed, the offender mu&s;t pay a rod of pure gold, of the thickne&s;s of the fin|ger of a ploughman who has plowed nine years, and in length from the ground to the Prince's mouth when &s;itting.</P>
<P>Matrimony between a &s;ingle pair, for mutual comfort, and for procreating children, implies the &s;tricte&s;t mutual fidelity. Adultery, however, is a deeper crime in the wife than in the hu&s;band: in him it may happen occa&s;ionally, with little or no alienation of affection; but the &s;uperior mode&s;ty of the female &s;ex is &s;uch, that a wife does not yield, till unlawful love prevails, not only over mo|de&s;ty, but over duty to her hu&s;band. Adultery, therefore, in the wife, is a breach of the matrimo|nial engagement in a double re&s;pect: it is an alie|nation of affection from the hu&s;band, which un|qualifies her to be his friend and companion; and it tends to bring a &s;purious i&s;&s;ue into the family, betraying the hu&s;band to maintain and educate children who are not his own.</P>
<P>The gradual advance of the female &s;ex to an equality with the male &s;ex, is vi&s;ible in the laws of female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that have been e&s;tabli&s;hed at dif|ferent times, and in different countries. It is not probable, that, in any country, women were early admitted to inherit land: they are too much de|&s;pi&s;ed among &s;avages for &s;o valuable a privilege. The fiercene&s;s and brutality of the ancient Ro|mans,
<PB N="219" REF="231">
in particular, unqualified the women to be their companions: it never entered their thoughts, that women &s;hould inherit land, which they can|not defend by the &s;word. But women came to be regarded, in proportion as the national manners re|fined. The law prohibiting female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in land, e&s;tabli&s;hed in days of ru&s;ticity, was held to be rigorous and unju&s;t, when the Romans were more poli&s;hed. Proprietors of land, &s;uch of them as had no &s;ons, were di&s;po&s;ed to evade the law, by ample provi&s;ions to their daughters, which render|ed the land of little value to the collateral heir|male. To reform that abu&s;e, as termed by the veterans, the Lex Voconia was made, confining &s;uch provi&s;ions within moderate bounds: and this regulation continued in force, till regard for the female &s;ex broke through every legal re&s;traint, and e&s;tabli&s;hed female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in land, as formerly in moveables<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;tinian, or, more properly, the lawyers employ|ed by him on that ab&s;urd compilation, the Pandects, is guilty of a gro&s;s error, in teaching, that, by the Twelve Tables, males and females of the &s;ame degree &s;ucceed|ed equally to land.

By the Salic law among the Franks, women were ex|pre&s;sly prohibited to inherit land; but we learn from the forms of Marculfus, that this propo&s;ition was in time eluded, by the following &s;olemnity: The man who wanted to put his daughter upon a footing with his &s;ons, carried her before the com|mi&s;&s;ary, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear child, an ancient and impious cu&s;tom bars a young women from &s;uc|ceeding to her father: but as all my children equally are given me by God, I ought to love them equally: therefore, my dear child, my will is, that my effects &s;hall divide equally between you and your brethren."</Q> In poli&s;hed &s;tates, women are not excluded from &s;ucceeding even to the crown.

<P>Among the Hurons in North-America, where the regal dignity is hereditary, and great regard paid to the royal family, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is conti|nued through females, in order to pre&s;erve the blood untained. When the chief dies, his &s;on &s;ucceeds not, but his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on; who certainly is of the royal blood, whoever be the father: and when the royal family is at an end, a chief is elect|ed by the noble&s;t matron of the tribe. The &s;ame rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion obtains among the Natches, a people bordering on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; it being an article in their creed, That their royal family are children of the &s;un. On the &s;ame belief was founded a law in Peru, appointing the heir of the crown to marry his &s;i&s;ter; which, equally with the law mentioned, pre&s;erved the blood of the &s;un in the royal family, and did not encroach &s;o much upon the natural order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion depends in &s;ome degree on the nature of the government. In Holland, all the children, male and female, &s;ucceed equally. The Hollanders live by commerce, which women are capable of as well as men. Land at the &s;ame time is &s;o &s;canty in that country, as to render it impracticable to rai&s;e a family by engro&s;&s;ing a great e&s;tate in land; and there is nothing but the ambition of rai&s;ing a family that can move a man to prefer one of his children before the re&s;t. The &s;ame law obtains in Hamburgh, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons. Exten&s;ive e&s;tates in land &s;upport great families in Britain, a circum&s;tance unfavourable to younger children. But probably in London, and

in other great trading towns, mercantile men take care to prevent the law, by making a more equal di&s;tribution of their effects among their children.</P>
<P>After traver&s;ing a great part of the globe with painful indu&s;try, will not one be apt to conclude, that originally females were every where de&s;pi&s;ed, as they are at pre&s;ent among the &s;avages of Ame|rica; that wives, like &s;laves, were procured by barter; that polygamy was univer&s;al; and that di|vorce depended on the whim of the hu&s;band? Such conclu&s;ion, however, would be ra&s;h; for upon a more accurate &s;crutiny, an exten&s;ive country is di&s;covered, where polygamy never was in fa&s;hion, and where women were from the be|ginning courted and honoured as among the mo&s;t po|li&s;hed nations.

Men and women among the Spartans bathed pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly, and wre&s;tled together &s;tark naked. Tacitus reports, that the Germans had not even &s;eparate beds, but lay promi&s;cuou&s;ly upon reeds or heath along the walls of the hou&s;e. The &s;ame cu&s;tom prevails, even at pre&s;ent, among the tem|perate Highlanders of Scotland; and is not quite worn out in New England. A married woman is under no confinement, becau&s;e no man thinks of an act &s;o irregular, as to attempt her cha&s;tity. In the Caribbee I&s;lands, adultery was unknown, till European Chri&s;tians made &s;ettlements there. At the &s;ame time, there &s;carce can be any &s;ewel for jealou&s;y, where men purcha&s;e their wives, put them away at plea&s;ure, and even lend them to a friend. But when, by ripening &s;en&s;ibility, a man puts a value on the affections of his wife, and on her attachment to him, jealou&s;y commences; jea|lou&s;y of a rival in her affections. Jealou&s;y accor|dingly is a &s;ymptom of an encrea&s;ing e&s;teem for the female &s;ex; and that pa&s;&s;ion is vi&s;ibly creeping in among the natives of Virginia. It begins to have a real foundation, when inequality of rank and of riches takes place. Men of opulence &s;tudy plea&s;ure: married women become objects of a cor|rupted ta&s;te; and often fall a &s;acrifice, where mo|rals are imperfect, and the climate favourable to animal love. Greece is a delicious country, the people hand&s;ome; and when the ancient Greeks made the greate&s;t figure, they were extremely de|fective in morals. They became jealous of their honour and of rivals; which prompted them, ac|cording to the rough manners of tho&s;e times, to exclude women from &s;ociety with men. The wo|men, accordingly, were never &s;een in public; and, if my memory &s;erve me, an accidental interview of a man and a woman on the public &s;treet brings on the cata&s;trophe in a Greek tragedy. In Hecu|ba,

By a law of the Vi&s;igoths in Spain, a &s;urgeon was prohibited to take blood from a free woman, except in pre|&s;ence of her hu&s;band or neare&s;t relations. By the Salic law<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Tit. xxii.</NOTE>, he who &s;queezes the hand of a free woman, &s;hall pay a fine of fifteen golden &s;hillings. In the fourteenth century, it was a rule in France, That no married woman ought to admit a man to vi&s;it her in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band. Female cha&s;tity mu&s;t, at that time, have been extremely feeble, when &s;o little tru&s;t was repo&s;ed in the fair &s;ex.</P>
<P>To treat women in that manner, may po&s;&s;ibly be nece&s;&s;ary, where they are in reque&s;t for no end but to gratify animal love. But where they are in|tended for the more elevated purpo&s;es, of being
<PB N="225" REF="237">
friends and companions, as well as affectionate mo|thers, a very different treatment is proper. Locks and &s;pies will never an&s;wer; for the&s;e tend to de|ba&s;e their minds, to corrupt their morals, and to render them contemptible. By gradual openings in the more delicate &s;en&s;es, particularly in all the branches of the moral &s;en&s;e, Cha&s;tity, one of the&s;e branches, acquires a commanding influence over females; and, when they are treated with humani|ty, becomes their ruling principle. In that refined &s;tate, women are tru&s;ted with their own conduct, and may &s;afely be tru&s;ted: they make delicious companions, and uncorruptible friends; and that &s;uch at pre&s;ent is generally their ca&s;e in Britain, I am bold to affirm. Anne of Britany, wife to Charles VIII. and to Lewis XII. Kings of France, introduced the fa&s;hion of ladies appearing pub|licly at court. This fa&s;hion was introduced much later in England: even down to the Revolution, women of rank never appeared in the &s;treets with|out a ma&s;k. In Scotland, the veil, or plaid, con|tinued long in fa&s;hion, with which every woman of rank was covered, when &s;he went abroad. That fa&s;hion has not been laid a&s;ide above forty years. In Italy, women were much longer confined than in France; and in Spain, the indulging them with &s;ome liberty, is but creeping into fa&s;hion at pre|&s;ent. In Aby&s;&s;inia, polygamy is prohibited; and married women of fa&s;hion have by cu&s;tom obtain|ed the privilege of vi&s;iting their friends, though not much with the good-will of many hu&s;bands. It were to be wi&s;hed, that a veil could be drawn over the following part of their hi&s;tory. The growth of luxury and &s;en&s;uality, undermining every moral principle, renders both &s;exes equally di&s;&s;o|lute: wives, in that ca&s;e, de&s;erve to be again lock|ed up: but the time of &s;uch &s;everity is pa&s;t. Then, indeed, it becomes indecent for the two &s;exes to
<PB N="226" REF="238">
bathe promi&s;cuou&s;ly. The men in Rome, copying the Greeks, plunged together into the &s;ame bath, and became &s;uch proficients in a&s;&s;urance, that men and women did the &s;ame<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Plutarch, Life of Cato.</NOTE>. Hadrian prohibited that indecent cu&s;tom. Marcus Antoninus renewed the prohibition; and Alexander Severus, a &s;econd time: but to &s;o little purpo&s;e, that even the pri|mitive Chri&s;tians made no difficulty to follow the cu&s;tom: &s;uch appetite there is for being nudus cum nuda, when ju&s;tified by fa&s;hion. This cu&s;tom with|&s;tood even the thunder of general councils; and was not dropped till people became more decent, in appearance at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>In days of innocence, when mode&s;ty is the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the female &s;ex, we find great frankne&s;s in external behaviour; for women who are above &s;u&s;picion are little &s;olicitous about ap|pearances. At the &s;ame period, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, we find great loo&s;ene&s;s in writing; witne&s;s, the Queen of Navarre's Tales. In the capital of France at pre&s;ent, cha&s;tity, far from being prac|ti&s;ed, is &s;carce admitted to be a female virtue. But people who take much freedom in private, are ex|tremely circum&s;pect in public: no indecent expre&s;|&s;ion nor in&s;inuation is admitted, even into their plays or other writings. In England, the women are le&s;s corrupted than in France; and, for that rea&s;on, are not &s;o &s;crupulous with re&s;pect to decency in writing.</P>
<P>Hitherto of the female &s;ex in temperate climes, where polygamy is prohibited. Very different is their condition in hot climes, which inflame ani|mal love in both &s;exes equally. In the hot regions of A&s;ia, where polygamy is indulged, and wives are purcha&s;ed for gratifying the carnal appetite merely, it is vain to think of re&s;training them other|wi&s;e
<PB N="227" REF="239">
than by locks and bars, after having once ta&s;ted enjoyment. Where polygamy is indulged, the body is the only object of jealou&s;y (not the mind), as there can be no mutual affection between a man and his in&s;truments of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure. And if women be &s;o little virtuous, as not to be &s;afely tru&s;ted with their own conduct, they ought to be locked up; for there is no ju&s;t medium be|tween ab&s;olute confinement and ab&s;olute freedom. The Chine&s;e are &s;o jealous of their wives, as even to lock them up from their relations; and &s;o great is their diffidence of the female &s;ex in ge|neral, that brothers and &s;i&s;ters are not permitted to conver&s;e together. When women are permitted to go abroad, they are &s;hut up in a clo&s;e &s;edan, in|to which no eye can penetrate. The intrigues car|ried on by the wives of the Chine&s;e Emperor, and the jealou&s;y that reigns among them, render them unhappy. But luckily, as women are little re|garded where polygamy is indulged, their ambition and intrigues give le&s;s di&s;turbance to the govern|ment, than in the courts of European princes. The ladies of Hindo&s;tan cover their heads with a gauze veil, even at home, which they lay not a&s;ide ex|cept in pre&s;ence of their neare&s;t relations. A Hin|doo buys his wife; and the fir&s;t time he is permit|ted to &s;ee her without a veil, is, after marriage, in his own hou&s;e. In &s;everal hot countries, women are put under the guard of eunuchs, as an additio|nal &s;ecurity; and black eunuchs are commonly preferred for their ugline&s;s. But as a woman, de|prived of the &s;ociety of a man, is apt to be in|flamed even with the appearance of a man, &s;ome jealous nations, refining upon that circum&s;tance, employ old maids, termed duennas, for guarding their women. In the city of Moka, in Arabia Felix, women of fa&s;hion never appear on the &s;treet in day-light; but it is a proof of manners
<PB N="228" REF="240">
refined above tho&s;e in neighbouring countries, that they are permitted to vi&s;it one another in the evening. If they find men in their way, they draw a&s;ide to let them pa&s;s. A French &s;urgeon being called by one of the King of Yeman's chief officers, to cure a rheumati&s;m which had &s;eized two of his wives, was permitted to handle the parts affected, but he could not get a &s;ight of their faces.</P>
<P>I proceed to examine more minutely the man|ners of women, as re&s;ulting from the degree of re|&s;traint they are under in different countries. In the warm regions of A&s;ia, where polygamy is in|dulged, the education of young women is extremely loo&s;e, being calculated for the &s;ole end of animal plea&s;ure. They are accompli&s;hed in &s;uch graces and allurements as tend to inflame the &s;en&s;ual ap|petite: they are taught vocal and in&s;trumental mu|&s;ic, with various dances that cannot &s;tand the te&s;t of decency: but no culture is be&s;towed on the mind, no moral in&s;truction, no improvement of the rational faculties; becau&s;e &s;uch education, which qualifies them for being virtuous compani|ons to men of &s;en&s;e, would in&s;pire them with ab|horrence at the being made pro&s;titutes. In a word, &s;o corrupted are they by vicious education, as to be unfit objects of any de&s;ire but what is merely &s;en&s;ual. The A&s;iatic ladies are not even tru&s;ted with the management of hou&s;ehold affairs, which would afford opportunities for infidelity. In Per&s;ia, &s;ays Chardin, the ladies are not permitted, more than children, to chu&s;e their own dre&s;s: no lady knows, in the morning, what gown &s;he is to wear that day. The education of young women in Hin|do&s;tan is le&s;s indecent. They are not taught mu&s;ic nor dancing, which are reckoned fit only for ladies of plea&s;ure: they are taught all the graces of ex|ternal behaviour; particularly, to conver&s;e with
<PB N="229" REF="241">
&s;pirit and elegance: they are taught al&s;o to few, to embroider, and to dre&s;s with ta&s;te. Writing is neglected; but they are taught to read, that they may have the con&s;olation of &s;tudying the Alcoran; which they never open, nor would un|der&s;tand if they did. Notwith&s;tanding &s;uch care in educating Hindo&s;tan ladies, their manners, by by being &s;hut up in a &s;eraglio, become extremely loo&s;e: the mo&s;t refined luxury of &s;en&s;e, joined with idlene&s;s, or with reading love-tales, &s;till wor&s;e than idlene&s;s, cannot fail to vitiate the minds of per&s;ons deprived of liberty, and to prepare them for every &s;ort of intemperance. The wives and con|cubines of grandees in Con&s;tantinople are permit|ted &s;ometimes to walk abroad for air and exerci&s;e. A foreigner &s;tumbling accidentally on a knot of them, about forty in number, attended with black eunuchs, was, in the twinkling of an eye, &s;eized by a bri&s;k girl, with the re&s;t at her heels; &s;he ac|co&s;ted him with loo&s;e, amorous expre&s;&s;ions, at|tempting at the &s;ame time to expo&s;e his nakedne&s;s. Neither threats nor intreaties availed him again&s;t &s;uch vigorous a&s;&s;ailants; nor could the vehemence of their curio&s;ity be moderated, by repre&s;enting the &s;hame of a behaviour &s;o gro&s;sly immode&s;t. An old Janizary, &s;tanding at a little di&s;tance, was amazed: his Mahometan ba&s;hfulne&s;s would not &s;uffer him to lay hands upon women; but, with a Stentorian voice, he roared to the black eu|nuchs, that they were guardians of pro&s;titutes, not of mode&s;t women; and urging them to free the man from &s;uch harpies.&mdash;All in vain<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on the Religion, Laws, &amp;c. of the Turks.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Very different are female manners in temperate climes, where polygamy is prohibited, and women
<PB N="230" REF="242">
are treated as rational beings. The&s;e manners, however, depend, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, upon the na|ture of the government. As many hands are at once employed in the different branches of republi|can government, and &s;till a greater number by ro|tation, the males, who have little time to &s;pare from public bu&s;ine&s;s, feel nothing of that languor and wearine&s;s, which, to the idle, make the mo&s;t frivolous amu&s;ements welcome. Married women live retired at home, managing family-affairs, as their hu&s;bands do tho&s;e of the &s;tate: whence it is, that &s;implicity of manners is more the tone of a re|public, than of any other government. Such were the manners of the female &s;ex, during the flouri&s;h|ing periods of the Greek and Roman common|wealths; and &s;uch are their manners in Switzer|land and in Holland. In a monarchy, government employs but a few hands; and tho&s;e who are not occupied with public bu&s;ine&s;s, give reins to gallan|try, and to other de&s;ires that are ea&s;ily gratified. Women of figure, on the other hand, corrupted by opulence and &s;uperficial education, are more ambitious to captivate the eye than the judgment; and are fonder of lovers than of friends. Where a man and a woman, thus di&s;ciplined, meet toge|ther, they &s;oon grow particular: the man is idle, the woman frank; and both equally addicted to plea|&s;ure. Such commerce mu&s;t, in its infancy be di&s;gui&s;ed under the appearance of virtue and religi|on: the mi&s;tre&s;s is exalted into a deity, the lover &s;inks into a humble votary; and this artificial rela|tion produces a bomba&s;t &s;ort of love, with &s;enti|ments that &s;oar high above nature. Duke John de Bourbonnois, ann. 1414, cau&s;ed it to be pro|claimed, that he intended an expedition to Eng|land with &s;ixteen knights, in order to combat the like number of Engli&s;h knights, for glorifying the

<P>Gratitude to my female readers, if I &s;hall be ho|noured with any, prompts me to conclude this &s;ketch with a &s;cene that may afford them in|&s;truction, and cannot fail of being agreeable; which is, the figure a woman is fitted for making in the matrimonial &s;tate, where polygamy is ex|cluded. Matrimony, among &s;avages, having no object but propagation and &s;lavery, is a very hum|bling &s;tate for the female &s;ex: but delicate orga|nization, great &s;en&s;ibility, lively imagination, with &s;weetne&s;s of temper above all, qualify women for a more dignified &s;ociety with men; which is, to be their bo&s;om-friends and companions. In the com|mon cour&s;e of European education, young women are trained to make an agreeable figure, and to behave with decency and propriety: very little culture is be&s;towed on the head; and &s;till le&s;s on the heart, if it be not the art of hiding pa&s;&s;ion.

of the female mind would add greatly to the happine&s;s of the males, and &s;till more to that of the females. Time runs on; and, when youth and beauty vani&s;h, a fine lady, who never enter|tained a thought into which an admirer did not en|ter, finds in her&s;elf a lamentable void, occa&s;ioning di&s;content and peevi&s;hne&s;s. But a woman who has merit, improved by virtuous and refined education, retains, in her decline, an influence over the men, more flattering than even that of beauty: &s;he is the delight of her friends, as formerly of her ad|mirers.</P>
<P>Admirable would be the effects of &s;uch refined education, contributing no le&s;s to public good than to private happine&s;s. A man, who at pre&s;ent mu&s;t degrade him&s;elf into a fop or a coxcomb, in order to plea&s;e the women, would &s;oon di&s;cover, that their favour is not to be gained, but by ex|erting every manly talent in public and in private life; and the two &s;exes, in&s;tead of corrupting each other, would be rivals in the race of virtue. Mutual e&s;teem would be to each a &s;chool of urbanity; and mutual de&s;ire of plea&s;ing would give &s;moothne&s;s to their behaviour, delicacy to their &s;entiments, and tenderne&s;s to their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Concerning Propagation of Animals, and Care of their Offspring.</HEAD>
<P>THE natural hi&s;tory of animals with re&s;pect to pairing, and care of their offspring, is &s;u&s;|ceptible of more elucidation than could regularly be introduced into the &s;ketch it&s;elf, where it makes but a &s;ingle argument. Loth to neglect a &s;ubject that eminently di&s;plays the wi&s;dom and benevolence of Providence, I gladly embrace the pre&s;ent opportu|nity, however &s;light, to add what further occurs upon it. Buffon, in many large volumes, be&s;tows &s;carce a thought on that favourite &s;ubject; and the neglect of our countrymen Ray and Derham is &s;till le&s;s excu&s;able, con&s;idering that to di&s;play the con|duct of Providence was their &s;ole purpo&s;e in writing on natural hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The in&s;tinct of pairing is be&s;towed on every &s;pe|cies of animals to which it is nece&s;&s;ary for rearing their young; and on no other &s;pecies. All wild birds pair: but with a remarkable difference be|tween &s;uch as place their ne&s;ts on trees, and &s;uch as place them on the ground. The young of the for|mer, being hatched blind, and without feathers, re|quire the nur&s;ing care of both parents till they be able to fly. The male feeds his mate on the ne&s;t, and chears her with a &s;ong. As &s;oon as the young are hatched, &s;inging yields to a more nece&s;&s;ary oc|cupation, that of providing food for a numerous i&s;&s;ue, a ta&s;k that requires both parents.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="251">
Eagles and other birds of prey build on trees, or on other inacce&s;&s;ible &s;pots. They not only pair, but continue in pairs all the year round; and the &s;ame pair procreate year after year. This at lea&s;t is the ca&s;e of eagles: the male and female hunt to|gether, unle&s;s during incubation, during which time the female is fed by the male. A greater num|ber than a &s;ingle pair never are &s;een in company.</P>
<P>Gregarious birds pair, in order probably to pre|vent di&s;cord in a &s;ociety confined to a narrow &s;pace. This is the ca&s;e particularly of pigeons and rooks. The male and female &s;it on the eggs alternately, and divide the care of feeding their young.</P>
<P>Partridges, plovers, phea&s;ants, peafowl, grou&s;e, and other kinds that place their ne&s;ts on the ground, have the in&s;tinct of pairing; but differ from &s;uch as build on trees in the following particular, that after the female is impregnated, &s;he completes her ta&s;k without needing any help from the male. Retiring from him, &s;he chu&s;es a &s;afe &s;pot for her ne&s;t, where &s;he can find plenty of worms and gra&s;s-&s;eed at hand. And her young, as &s;oon as hatched, take foot, and &s;eek food for them&s;elves. The only remaining duty incumbent on the dam is, to lead them to proper places for food, and to call them together when danger impends. Some males, provoked at the de&s;ertion of their mates, break the eggs if they &s;tumble on them. Eider ducks pair like other birds that place their ne&s;ts on the ground; and the female fini&s;hes her ne&s;t with down plucked from her own brea&s;t. If the ne&s;t be de&s;troy'd for the down, which is remarkably warm and ela&s;tic, &s;he makes another ne&s;t as before. If &s;he be robbed a &s;econd time, &s;he makes a third ne&s;t; but the male furni&s;hes the down. A lady of &s;pirit ob&s;erved, that the Eider duck may give a le&s;&s;on to many a married wo|man, who is more di&s;po&s;ed to pluck her hu&s;band than her&s;elf. The black game never pair: in &s;pring
<PB N="240" REF="252">
the cock on an eminence crows, and claps his wings; and all the females within hearing in&s;tant|ly re&s;ort to him.</P>
<P>Pairing birds, excepting tho&s;e of prey, flock to|gether in February, in order to chu&s;e their mates. They &s;oon di&s;per&s;e; and are not &s;een afterward but in pairs.</P>
<P>Pairing is unknown to quadrupeds that feed on gra&s;s. To &s;uch it would be u&s;ele&s;s; as the female gives &s;uck to her young while &s;he her&s;elf is feeding. If M. Buffon de&s;erves credit, the roe-deer are an exception. They pair, though they feed on gra&s;s, and have but one litter in a year.</P>
<P>Bea&s;ts of prey, &s;uch as lions, tigers, wolves, pair not. The female is left to &s;hift for her&s;elf and for her young; which is a laborious ta&s;k, and often &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful as to &s;horten the life of many of them. Pairing is e&s;&s;ential to birds of prey, becau&s;e incuba|tion leaves the female no &s;ufficient time to hunt for food. Pairing is not nece&s;&s;ary to bea&s;ts of prey, be|cau&s;e their young can bear a long fa&s;t. Add ano|ther rea&s;on, that they would multiply &s;o fa&s;t by pairing as to prove trouble&s;ome neighbours to the human race.</P>
<P>Among animals that pair not, males fight de&s;pe|rately about a female. Such a battle among horned cattle is finely de&s;cribed by Lucretius. Nor is it unu&s;ual for &s;even or eight lions to wage bloody war for a &s;ingle female.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;on that makes pairing nece&s;&s;ary for gregarious birds, obtains with re&s;pect to gregarious quadrupeds; tho&s;e e&s;pecially who &s;tore up food for winter, and during that &s;ea&s;on live in common. Di&s;cord among &s;uch would be attended with wor&s;e con&s;equences than even among lions and bulls, who are not confined to one place. The beavers, with re&s;pect to pairing, re&s;emble birds that place their ne&s;ts on the ground. As &s;oon as the young are pro|duced,
<PB N="241" REF="253">
the males abandon their &s;tock of food to their mates, and live at large; but return frequent|ly to vi&s;it them while they are &s;uckling their young.</P>
<P>Hedge-hogs pair as well as &s;everal of the mon|key-kind. We are not well acquainted with the natural hi&s;tory of the&s;e animals; but it would ap|pear that the young require the nur&s;ing care of both parents.</P>
<P>Seals have a &s;ingular economy. Polygamy &s;eems to be a law of nature among them, as a male a&s;&s;ociates with &s;everal females. The &s;ea|turtle has no occa&s;ion to pair, as the female con|cludes her ta&s;k by laying her eggs in the &s;and. The young are hatched by the &s;un; and immediately crawl to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>In every other branch of animal economy con|cerning the continuance of the &s;pecies, the hand of Providence is equally con&s;picuous. The young of pairing birds are produced in the &s;pring, when the weather begins to be comfortable; and their early production makes them firm and vigorous before winter, to endure the hard&s;hips of that rigorous &s;ea&s;on. Such early production is in par|ticular favourable to eagles, and other birds of prey; for in the &s;pring they have plenty of food, by the return of birds of pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Though the time of ge&s;tation varies con&s;iderably in the different quadrupeds that feed on gra&s;s, yet the female is regularly delivered early in &s;ummer, when gra&s;s is in plenty. The mare admits the &s;tallion in &s;ummer, carries eleven months, and is delivered the beginning of May. The cow differs little. A &s;heep and a goat take the male in No|vember, carry five months, and produce when gra&s;s begins to &s;pring. The&s;e animals love &s;hort
<PB N="242" REF="254">
gra&s;s, upon which a mare or a cow would &s;tarve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have it upon good authority, that ewes pa&s;tur|ing in a hilly country pitch early on &s;ome &s;nug &s;pot, where they may drop their young with &s;afety. And hence the ri&s;k of removing a flock to a new field im|mediately before delivery: many lambs peri&s;h by being dropped in improper places.</NOTE>. The rutting-&s;ea&s;on of the red deer is the end of September, and beginning of Octo|ber: it continues for three weeks, during which time the male runs from female to female without intermi&s;&s;ion. The female brings forth in May, or beginning of June; and the fe|male of the fallow deer brings forth at the &s;ame time. The &s;he-a&s;s is in &s;ea&s;on begin|ning of &s;ummer; but &s;he bears twelve months, which fixes her delivery to &s;ummer. Wolves and foxes copulate in December: the female carries five months, and brings forth in April, when animal food is as plentiful as at any other &s;ea&s;on; and the &s;he-lion brings forth about the &s;ame time. Of this early birth there is one evident advantage, hinted above: the young have time to grow &s;o firm as ea&s;ily to bear the inclemencies of winter.</P>
<P>Were one to gue&s;s what probably would be the time of rutting, &s;ummer would be named, e&s;pecially in a cold climate. And yet to qua|drupeds who carry but four or five months, that economy would be pernicious, throwing the time of delivery to an improper &s;ea&s;on for warmth, as well as for food. Wi&s;ely is it ordered, that the delivery &s;hould con&s;tantly be at the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for both.</P>
<P>Gregarious quadrupeds that &s;tore up food for winter, differ from all other quadrupeds with
<PB N="243" REF="255">
re&s;pect to the time of delivery. Beavers copu|late the end of autumn, and bring forth in Ja|nuary, when their granary is full. The &s;ame economy probably obtains among all other qua|drupeds of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>One rule takes place among all brute ani|mals, without a &s;ingle exception, That the fe|male never is burdened with two litters at the &s;ame time. The time of ge&s;tation is &s;o un|erringly calculated by nature, that the young brood upon hand can provide for them&s;elves before another brood comes on. Even a hare is not an exception, though many litters are produced in a year. The female carries thirty or thirty-one days; but &s;he &s;uckles her young only twen|ty days, after which they provide for them&s;elves, and leave her free to a new litter.</P>
<P>The care of animals to pre&s;erve their young from harm is a beautiful in&s;tance of Provi|dence. When a hind hears the hounds, &s;he puts her&s;elf in the way of being hunted, and leads them away from her fawn. The lapwing is no le&s;s ingenious: if a per&s;on approach, &s;he flies about, retiring always from her ne&s;t. A partridge is extremely artful: &s;he hops away, hanging a wing as if broken: lingers till the per&s;on approach, and hops again. A hen, timid by nature, is bold as a lion in defence of her young: &s;he darts upon every creature that threat|ens danger. The roe-buck defends its young with re&s;olution and courage. So doth a ram; and &s;o do many other quadrupeds.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by an ingenious writer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE>, that nature &s;ports in the colour of dome&s;tic animals, in
<PB N="244" REF="256">
order that men may the more readily di&s;tingui&s;h their own. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, why colour is more varied in &s;uch animals, than in tho&s;e which remain in the &s;tate of nature: I can only &s;ay, that the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned is not &s;atisfactory. One is &s;el|dom at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h one animal from ano|ther; and Providence never interpo&s;es to vary the ordinary cour&s;e of nature, for an end &s;o little ne|ce&s;&s;ary as to make the di&s;tinction &s;till more obvi|ous. Such interpo&s;ition would be&s;ide have a bad effect, by encouraging inattention and indolence.</P>
<P>The foregoing particulars are offered to the pub|lic as hints merely: may it not be hoped, that they will excite curio&s;ity in tho&s;e who reli&s;h natu|ral hi&s;tory? The field is rich, though little culti|vated; and I know no other branch of natural hi&s;tory that opens finer views into the conduct of Providence.</P>
