<P>AS the PROLOGUE has, in part, apologized for this alteration from BEN JOHNSON, nothing more need be added, but that it was meant to give Mr. WESTON's e&s;tabli&s;hed merit in the character of <HI>Abel Drugger,</HI> more frequent, familiar, and com|pact opportunity of &s;hewing it&s;elf, than the Old Play can po&s;&s;ibly afford; upon compari&s;on, it will be found, that very little of the original is retained, but a general idea, and the part of <HI>Abel Drugger,</HI> to which however, &s;ome additions have been made.</P>

<P>A poor, ignorant, impertinent, ungrateful wretch; who&s;e life, to my di&s;grace be it &s;poken, I have &s;aved&mdash;vile emblem of an empty ca&s;k, much &s;ound, no contents, can&s;t thou forget the mouldy cru&s;ts, Suffolk chee&s;e, and dead &s;mall beer, on which thou wert &s;tarving in common with bare-ribbed rats and limping mice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Face.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mighty well, mighty well, ma&s;ter Subtle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Subtle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I not made thee an occa&s;ional captain, am I not filling thy pockets as well as thy belly; have I not taught thee, dull as thou art, to con|ver&s;e with, and impo&s;e on various degrees of man|kind? have I not from the &s;tupide&s;t &s;lave that ever marred common &s;en&s;e &s;harpened thy wit, &s;moothed thy tongue, poli&s;hed thy manners, regulated thy features, to make thee capable of thriving in life, and this treatment, my hopeful recompence?</P>

<P>Remember St. Giles's Scape-grace where I found thee a compleat emblem of poverty, re&s;embling the fruit of a gibbet &s;even years expo&s;ed to wind and weather, not a coat to thy back, a &s;tocking to thy legs, nor a &s;hoe to thy feet.</P>

<P>Did I not enable thee to carry on the deceptions of alchymy, fortune telling, and algebra; your minerals, your vegetals, and animals, to fleece the credulous vulgar; have not I provided you with conjuror's robes, &s;tills, gla&s;&s;es, furnaces, coals, and all other materials, to carry on thy profitable farce? an&s;wer me knave have I not done all this?</P>
