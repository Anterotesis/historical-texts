<P>To be a Patriot in the&s;e days, is to provide a Task for the Tongues of the Envious, and to give Alms and Relieve tho&s;e that are in want, is immediately &s;et down for an Act of <HI>O&s;tentation</HI>; el&s;e, Sir <HI>Charles Duncomb</HI> had &s;een his Countrymen <HI>Reap</HI> the Fruits of what he <HI>Sow'd,</HI> and the Voice of the People had ble&s;s'd him for giving Ear to the Cry of the Pri&s;oners, and plentifully dealing part of what he was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of to People in Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But I give more Offence to your Pa|tience in remembring you of the <HI>Good</HI> you have done, than the <HI>Poeta&s;ter,</HI> who has occa&s;ion'd the following Re|marks, by putting on the Readers be|lief by the <HI>Ill</HI> you have <HI>not</HI>; and it is equally trouble&s;ome to be accus'd of Faults

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THere being nothing material in the Preface to this &s;currilous Satyr, that has not been repeated over and over again in the Body of it; I cannot but think it very &s;uitable to the Bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, to forbear making any further Remarks on the Poets Indecencies, and apply my &s;elf to make Excu&s;es for my own.</P>
<P>If the Performance I have let loo&s;e in|to the World is Bad, I have nothing to urge in my own defence, but the ha&s;t I was o|blig'd to make in the fini&s;hing it, thro' the de&s;ire of two or three Friends, and the diffi|culty there is in an&s;wering a Pamphlet Para|graph by Paragraph, which has &s;uch a Re|dundancy of Tautologies, as this has.</P>
<P>I &s;hould indeed have made my Reply to it in Ver&s;e, that being counted the fairer way of entring the Li&s;ts with a Poet, but as I never had any great Inclination to <HI>Dactyls</HI> and <HI>Spondees,</HI> &s;o I was afraid I &s;hould &s;hew my &s;elf as great a Bungler at the <HI>Trade</HI> of Rhiming as the Per&s;on has convinc'd the World he is, whom I write in oppo&s;ition to.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">However, &s;ince he ends his Preface in Ver&s;e, I hope I &s;hall &s;tand excus'd, if I make u&s;e of the &s;ame Method, and give the Reader a &s;hort Specimen of my Poetry, after he has tyr'd him with a large one of his. My Intent at fir&s;t, notwith&s;tanding my &s;mall Acquaintance with the Nine <HI>Water drinking</HI> Ladies the Mu&s;es, was to have taken up the Cudgels with him in Ver&s;e, but &s;uch a De&s;ign requiring more Time than I have to be&s;tow upon Poetry, I thought it advi&s;able to lay it a&s;ide, that I might drudge on in the Beaten Way of <HI>good Hone&s;t, Humble</HI> Pro&s;e, and have flung by the following Lines which were written as &s;o many An|&s;wers to his two fir&s;t Paragraphs.<Q><L>Satyr, Ari&s;e, Thy Whips and Stings provide,</L>

<HEAD>THE True Born-Engli&s;hman. A SATYR, An&s;wer'd Paragraph by Pa|ragraph.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is the Duty of every one, that breaths <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Air, to &s;tand up for the Place of his Nativity, and Vindicate the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation from the Reproaches which Malice would fa&s;ten on it; &s;o I cannot but think my &s;elf oblig'd to take notice of a Libel which has &s;toln into the World, under the Name of a Satyr, and di&s;pers'd its Venom in a conceal'd manner, again&s;t a People who&s;e Reputation in the Arts of War and Peace has rendred 'em Famous throughout all Chri&s;tendom. Had the Author of it been <HI>an open Enemy, perhaps, I could have born it,</HI> but he is <HI>our Acquaintance, and our fami|liar Friend,</HI> a Man &s;ubject to the &s;ame Laws as <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are, and Liable to the &s;ame Obliga|tions; entertain'd by 'em, when he was forc'd
<PB N="2" REF="9">
to fly from the <HI>Scourges</HI> of <HI>Ireland</HI>; and Ho&s;pi|tably receiv'd, when he had not where to lay his Head in a Kingdom which owes her Obe|dience to this. The Printer al&s;o is known for what he is, a Sowre, Di&s;contented, Canting Fellow, as ever <HI>Murmur'd</HI> at falling <HI>Manna,</HI> or found fault with the Bounties of the Almighty. He has formerly been made City Surveyor, for a Crime of the &s;ame Nature, and taken a Pro|&s;pect of its Buildings from his Wooden Edifice in the middle of the Street; and one might have thought, unle&s;s he was in love with that Scanda|lous Office, he would have avoided all manner of Occa&s;ion of bring <HI>lifted up above his Neigh|bours</HI> again. But He's arriv'd to &s;uch a heighth of Malignancy, &s;uch an inveteracy of Temper, as to be his Author's Humble Servant, while he was Lampooning his God, and making Sport with the Divine Exi&s;tence of Him that made Him. There|fore 'tis not to be &s;uppos'd he would &s;tick at lend|ing his helping Hand towards Abu&s;es upon the Country where he would have us think him <HI>Born,</HI> after he had been forward in promoting Bla&s;phe|mous Expre&s;&s;ions, again&s;t the Holy One of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> that gave him <HI>Breath.</HI> I &s;hall have Field enough el&s;ewhere to take the Author to task, who ac|knowledg'd he expected it in his Preface, tho' for other &s;ort of Indecencies, than His <HI>mean Style, rough Ver&s;e, and incorrect Language,</HI> and make appear he labours under a greater &s;carcity of Manners, than the Country he &s;hews his Teeth at ever can. We are happy indeed that a Man of his Cha|racter has no great e&s;teem for us, and 'tis a cer|tain &s;ign a People is Good when tho&s;e who are notoriou&s;ly Wicked, &s;peak reproachfully of 'em; &s;ince it mu&s;t be granted, few Men fall out
<PB N="3" REF="10">
with their own likene&s;s, or are at variance with their own Re&s;emblance. But <HI>a Man is known by his Works,</HI> and the way to make him appear in his true Colours, is to &s;earch into 'em, and find out the Blackne&s;s of his <HI>Soul,</HI> by the foul|ne&s;s of his <HI>Thoughts.</HI> It's fitting therefore we fall into the <HI>SATYR,</HI> and examine whether the Poet be as infamous as the Subject, or he has the &s;ame Talent of ingratitude in Ver&s;e, as he is celebrated for in Pro&s;e. Mr. <HI>T&mdash;</HI> has a fit of Mortification coming upon him, or he would have le&s;s value for the Hungry Entertain|ments on Mount <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and is reconciling him&s;elf to his old Je&s;uitical Ab&s;tinence and Days of Fa&s;ting, or he would &s;carce fall in Love with telling his Fingers, and making wry Faces for adequate Epithets, as he now certainly does. While his ver&s;ifying Folly gives us Occa&s;ion to examine his other faults, and make an E&s;timate of the la&s;t from the wretched Ingredients the fir&s;t is compos'd of. But his Poetry carries &s;uch an invitation with it, that it's pity the Reader &s;hould be any longer detain'd from it. I &s;hall be|gin therefore with the Invocation of his Mu&s;e which I find is but a very &s;curvey one by her Name and to avoid Confu&s;ion, make Remarks on this Celebrated Piece, Paragraph after Para|graph.</P>

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Speak, <HI>Satyr;</HI> for there's none can tell like thee,</L>
<L>Whether 'tis Folly, Pride, or Knavery,</L>
<L>That makes the di&s;contented Land appear</L>
<L>Le&s;s happy now in Times of Peace, than War:</L>
<L>Why Civil Feuds di&s;turb the Nation more</L>
<L>Than all our bloody Wars have done before.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Satyr,</HI> is too mild a Name, and the De&s;ign of it too good to be made u&s;e of by &s;uch a Per&s;on as the Poet; had he de&s;ir'd the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a <HI>Biling&s;gate</HI> Amazon, 'twould have been more agreeable to the Matter contain'd in the Poem. For Refor|mation is very far from his Intentions, &s;ince to create Jealou&s;ies and Unea&s;ine&s;s among&s;t us, has been always the bu&s;ine&s;s of Incendiaries like him&s;elf; and if the Land is di&s;contented, he's mi&s;taken in the Cau&s;e of it, which probably is, we have had &s;o much Money &s;pent to &s;upport a <HI>War,</HI> that &s;ome People have very little left to enjoy after a <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Fools out of Favour grudge at Knaves in Place,</L>
<L><HI>And Men are always hone&s;t in Di&s;grace:</HI></L>
<L>The Court-Preferments make Men Knaves in cour&s;e:</L>
<L>But they which wou'd be in them wou'd be wor&s;e.</L>
<L>'Tis not at Foreigners that we repine,</L>
<L>Wou'd Foreigners their Perqui&s;ites re&s;ign:</L>
<L>The Grand Contention's plainly to be &s;een,</L>
<L>To get &s;ome Men put out, and &s;ome put in.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="12">For this our S&mdash;rs make long Harangues,</L>
<L>And florid M&mdash;rs whet their poli&s;h'd Tongues.</L>
<L><HI>State&s;men are always &s;ick of one Di&s;ea&s;e;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And a good Pen&s;ion gives them pre&s;ent Ea&s;e,</HI></L>
<L>That's the Specifick makes them all content</L>
<L>With any King, and any Government.</L>
<L>Good Patriots at Court-Abu&s;es rail,</L>
<L>And all the Nation's Grievances bewail:</L>
<L>But when the <HI>Sov'reign Bal&s;am</HI>'s once appli'd,</L>
<L>The Zealot never fails to change his Side.</L>
<L>And when he mu&s;t the <HI>Golden Key</HI> re&s;ign,</L>
<L>The <HI>Railing Spirit</HI> comes about again.</L></Q>
<P>The Parliament, in general, is much oblig'd to him for &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions in this Paragraph, and Mr. <HI>H&mdash;</HI> in particular, who I am &s;atisfied loves his Country better than any <HI>Golden Key</HI> what&s;oever. Every true Patriot ought to &s;tand up for his own Countrymen; and if Foreigners jump into Po&s;ts, that our Civil Con&s;titutions allow <HI>Natives</HI> only to be in&s;tated in, 'tis their Bu&s;ine&s;s as they are <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Repre&s;entatives, to take care of the Peoples Prerogatives they are entru&s;ted with. And if tho&s;e <HI>florid Members</HI> that &s;tand up for the Liberties of the People, do it for the &s;ake of a <HI>Pen&s;ion,</HI> he pa&s;&s;es a very odd Compliment on His Maje&s;ty, by in&s;inuating as much, as when they are &s;ick of the <HI>Money-Di|&s;temper,</HI> there is a certain <HI>Court Elixir</HI> which has been infallible in the Cure of 'em.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Who &s;hall this Bubbl'd Nation di&s;abu&s;e,</HI></L>
<L>While they their own Felicities refu&s;e?</L>
<L>Who at the Wars have made &s;uch mighty Pother,</L>
<L>And now are falling out with one another:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="13">With needle&s;s Fears the Jealous Nation fill,</L>
<L><HI>And always have been &s;av'd again&s;t their Will:</HI></L>

<P>If the Nation's <HI>Bubbled,</HI> it's well for the Game|&s;ters at t'other end of the Town; but I am a better Subject than to think &s;o. I hear of no Members that <HI>refu&s;e their own Felicities,</HI> but are again&s;t giving away their Birth-right to Stran|gers. And how we come to be <HI>&s;av'd again&s;t our will,</HI> it's impo&s;&s;ible for me to conjecture, when if we had not forwarded our own Salvations, Matters would &s;carce have been as they now &s;tand, and our New Monarch had not had the Gift of our Obedience, had not we eagerly un|done our Old, which is far from being an Act that is involuntary. But our Author is as good at Sen&s;e, as he is at Chirurgery, when he's for making <HI>Inci&s;ions</HI> in&s;tead of giving proper Anti|dotes to repel Poi&s;on.</P>
<Q><L>Whet thy ju&s;t Anger at the Nation's Pride;</L>

<P>The Report this Paragraph is grounded up|on, is as fal&s;e as Hell, and Sir <HI>Charles</HI> was &s;o far from getting &s;uch a large Sum by the Re|volution, that it's well known to &s;ome Per&s;ons who are more Acquainted with him than the Author, he lo&s;t con&s;iderably by &s;everal belong|ing to the Court of St. <HI>Germains.</HI> Yet he Valued the Intere&s;t of the Country he was born in, more than his own, and Rejoyced at his pre|&s;ent Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, purely out of a Principle of Love to the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> not becau&s;e he had out-witted the <HI>King.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<Q><L>THen let us boa&s;t of Ance&s;tors no more,</L>
<L>Or Deeds of Heroes done in days of Yore,</L>
<L>In latent Records of the Ages pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Behind the Rear of Time, in long Oblivion plac'd.</L>
<L>For if our Virtues mu&s;t in Lines de&s;cend,</L>
<L>The Merit with the Families would end:</L>
<L>And Intermixtures would mo&s;t Fatal grow;</L>
<L>For Vice would be Hereditary too;</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="94">The Tainted Blood wou'd of nece&s;&s;ity,</L>
<L>Involuntary Wickedne&s;s convey.</L></Q>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion bears very little proportion to the Premi&s;es, for the Clo&s;e of the Poem is fill'd with a Libel again&s;t Sir <HI>Charles Duncomb</HI> only, who is &s;o far from <HI>boa&s;ting of his Ance&s;tors,</HI> that he is very ready to acknowledge he did not come into the World with that Advantage as &s;ome do. If he did actually value him&s;elf on the Account of his De&s;cent; what Relation does that bear to the Nation in General? Or what Plea has the Au|thor to Ju&s;tifie him&s;elf with, for Taxing above two Millions of People with a Folly which he only charg'd one in particular with.</P>
<Q><L>Vice like Ill Nature, for an Age or two,</L>
<L>May &s;eem a Generation to pur&s;ue;</L>
<L>But Virtue &s;eldom does regard the Breed;</L>
<L>Fools do the Wi&s;e, and Wi&s;e Men Fools &s;ucceed.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Ill Nature</HI> is certainly a Vice, therefore the Con&s;equence of his <HI>Simile</HI> is, that Vice is like Vice, which every one knew before. And if <HI>Ver|tue does not regard the Breed,</HI> I am inclinable to think he de&s;erves no manner of Excu&s;e, for making <HI>Vice</HI> an Attendant of it, and tainting the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Po&s;terity with the Ba&s;ene&s;s of their Fore-Fathers: Since a Love of Virtue without doubt has as much prevalence, and run's in the Blood, as an Inclination towards Actions that are Vitious.&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>What is't to us, what Ance&s;tors we had?</L>
<L>If Good, what better? Or what wor&s;e, if Bad?</L>
<L>Examples are for Imitation &s;et,</L>
<L>Yet all Men follow Virtue with Regret.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="88" REF="95">That que&s;tion is re&s;olv'd without any Difficul|ty, for if our Ance&s;tors were good, than the remembrance of their Brave Actions would ex|cite us to tread in the &s;ame Paths of Honour; if Bad, the Reflections on their di&s;honourable Practices would create in us a Dete&s;tation of Vice, and make us endeavour to degenerate from 'em.</P>
<Q><L>Cou'd but our Ance&s;tors retrieve their Fate,</L>
<L>And &s;ee their Off-&s;pring thus degenerate;</L>
<L>How we contend for Birth and Names unknown,</L>
<L>And build on their pa&s;t Actions, not our own;</L>
<L>They'd cancel Records; and their Tombs deface,</L>
<L>And openly di&s;own the vile degenerate Race:</L>
<L>For Fame of Families is all a Cheat,</L>
<L><HI>'Tis Per&s;onal Virtue only makes us great.</HI></L></Q>
<P>This Paragraph &s;eems to contradict the main De&s;ign of all that went before; for the Intent of the Satyr was to render our Ance&s;tors Infamous, but now he &s;ays we Degenerate from 'em, which in plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is, we do nothing that is not Prai&s;e worthy.
