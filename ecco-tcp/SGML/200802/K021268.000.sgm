<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the following Comedy, my purpo&s;e was, to draw a FEMALE CHARACTER, which with the mo&s;t lively Sen&s;ibility, fine Un|der&s;tanding, and elegant Accompli&s;hments, &s;hould unite that beautiful Re&s;erve and Delicacy which, whil&s;t they veil tho&s;e charms, render them &s;till more intere&s;ting. In delineating &s;uch a Character, my heart naturally dedicated it to YOUR MAJESTY; and nothing remained, but permi&s;&s;ion to lay it at Your feet. Your Maje&s;ty's graciou&s;ly allowing me this high Honour, is the point to which my hopes a&s;pired, and a reward, of which without cen&s;ure I may be proud.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>With the warme&s;t wi&s;hes for the continuance of your Maje&s;ty's felicity, I am YOUR MAJESTY's Mo&s;t devoted and mo&s;t dutiful Servant, <HI>H. Cowley.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<STAGE>Enter <HI>Saville,</HI> followed by a Servant, at the top of the &s;tage, looking round, as if at a lo&s;s.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saville.</SPEAKER>
<P>LINCOLN's-INN!&mdash;Well, but where to find him, now I am in Lincoln's-Inn?&mdash;Where did he &s;ay his Ma&s;ter was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>He only &s;aid in Lincoln's-Inn, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's pretty! And your wi&s;dom never enquired at who&s;e chambers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you &s;poke to the &s;ervant your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I was too impatient to a&s;k que&s;tions, you ought to have taken directions, blockhead!
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Courtall <HI>&s;inging.</HI></STAGE>
Ha, Courtall!&mdash;Bid him keep the hor&s;es in motion, and then enquire at all the chambers round.
<STAGE>Exit &s;ervant.</STAGE>
What the devil brings you to this part of the town?&mdash; Have any of the Long Robes, hand&s;ome wives, &s;i&s;ters or chambermaids?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps they have;&mdash;but I came on a different errand; and, had thy good fortune brought thee here half
<PB N="2" REF="5">
an hour &s;ooner, I'd have given thee &s;uch a treat, ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm &s;orry I mi&s;s'd it: what was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was informed a few days &s;ince, that my cou&s;ins Fallow were come to town, and de&s;ired earne&s;tly to &s;ee me at their lodgings in Warwick-Court, Holborn. Away drove I, painting them all the way as &s;o many Hebes. They came from the farthe&s;t part of Northumber|land, had never been in town, and in cour&s;e were made up of ru&s;ticity, innocence, and beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>After waiting thirty minutes, during which there was a violent bu&s;tle, in bounced five &s;allow dam|&s;els, four of them maypoles;&mdash;the fifth, Nature, by way of variety, had bent in the Ae&s;op &s;tyle.&mdash;But they all opened at once, like hounds on a fre&s;h &s;cent:&mdash;<Q>Oh, cou&s;in Courtall!&mdash;How do you do, cou&s;in Courtall! Lord, cou&s;in, I am glad you are come! We want you to go with us to the Park, and the Plays, and the Opera, and Almack's, and all the fine places!</Q>&mdash; The devil, thought I, my dears, may attend you, for I am &s;ure I won't.&mdash;However, I heroically &s;tayed an hour with them, and di&s;covered, the virgins were all come to town with the hopes of leaving it&mdash;Wives:&mdash;their heads full of Knight-Baronights, Fops, and adventures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, how did you get off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, pleaded a million engagements.&mdash;How|ever, con&s;cience twitched me; &s;o I breakfa&s;ted with them this morning, and afterwards '&s;quired them to the gardens here, as the mo&s;t private place in town; and then took a &s;orrowful leave, complaining of my hard, hard fortune, that obliged me to &s;et off immediately for Dor|&s;et&s;hire, ha! ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I congratulate your e&s;cape!&mdash;Courtall at Al|mack's, with five aukward country cou&s;ins! ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Why, your exi&s;tence, as a Man of Gallantry, could never have &s;urvived it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Death, and fire! had they come to town, like the ru&s;tics of the la&s;t age, to &s;ee Paul's, the Lions, and the Wax-work&mdash;at their &s;ervice;&mdash;but the cou&s;ins of our days come up Ladies&mdash;and, with the knowledge they glean from magazines and pocket-books, Fine Ladies; laugh at the ba&s;hfulne&s;s of their grandmothers, and boldly de|mand their <HI>entr&eacute;es</HI> in the fir&s;t circles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where can this fellow be!&mdash;Come, give me &s;ome news&mdash;I have been at war with woodcocks and par|tridges the&s;e two months, and am a &s;tranger to all that has pa&s;&s;ed out of their region.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! enough for three Gazettes. The Ladies are going to petition for a bill, that, during the war, every man may be allowed Two Wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould &s;ucceed, for the ma|jority of both Hou&s;es know what it is to have one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gallantry was black-ball'd at the <HI>Coterie</HI> la&s;t Thur&s;day, and Prudence and Cha&s;tity voted in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that may hold 'till the Camps break up.&mdash; But have ye no elopements? no divorces?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Divorces are ab&s;olutely out, and the Commons-Doctors &s;tarving; &s;o they are publi&s;hing trials of <HI>Crim. Con.</HI> with all the &s;eparate evidences at large; which they find has always a wonderful effect on their trade, actions tumbling in upon them afterwards, like mackarel at Grave&s;end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>What more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing&mdash;for weddings, deaths, and politics, I never talk of, but whil&s;t my hair is dre&s;&s;ing. But prithee, Saville, how came you in town, whil&s;t all the qualified gentry are playing at pop-gun on Coxheath, and the country over-run with hares and foxes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came to meet my friend Doricourt, who, you know, is lately arrived from Rome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arrived! Yes, faith, and has cut us all out! &mdash;His carriage, his liveries, his dre&s;s, him&s;elf, are the
<PB N="4" REF="7">
rage of the day! His fir&s;t appearance &s;et the whole <HI>Ton</HI> in a ferment, and his valet is be&s;ieged by <HI>lev&eacute;es</HI> of tay|lors, habit-makers, and other Mini&s;ters of Fa&s;hion, to gratify the impatience of their cu&s;tomers for becoming <HI>&agrave; la mode de Doricourt.</HI> Nay, the beautiful Lady Fro|lic, t'other night, with two &s;i&s;ter Counte&s;&s;es, in&s;i&s;ted upon his wai&s;tcoat for muffs; and their &s;nowy arms now bear it in triumph about town, to the heart-rending af|fliction of all our <HI>Beaux Gor&ccedil;ons.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! Well, tho&s;e little gallantries will &s;oon be over; he's on the point of marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marriage! Doricourt on the point of marriage! 'Tis the happie&s;t tidings you could have given, next to his being hanged&mdash;Who is the Bride elect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never &s;aw her; but 'tis Mi&s;s Hardy, the rich heire&s;s&mdash;the match was made by the parents, and the court&s;hip begun on their nur&s;es knees; Ma&s;ter u&s;ed to crow at Mi&s;s, and Mi&s;s u&s;ed to chuckle at Ma&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! then by this time they care no more for each other, than I do for my country cou&s;ins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that; they have never met &s;ince thus high, and &s;o, probably, have &s;ome regard for each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never met! Odd!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>A whim of Mr. Hardy's; he thought his daugh|ter's charms would make a more forcible impre&s;&s;ion, if her lover remained in ignorance of them 'till his return from the Continent.</P>

<P>Judging of the ma&s;ter from the re&s;t of the family. What the devil is the meaning of that flock of foreigners below, with their parchment faces and &s;nuffy whi&s;kers? What! can't an Engli&s;hman &s;tand behind your carriage, buckle your &s;hoe, or bru&s;h your coat?</P>

<P>Stale, my dear Saville, &s;tale! Engli&s;hmen make the be&s;t Soldiers, Citizens, Artizans, and Philo&s;ophers in the world; but the very wor&s;t Footmen. I keep French
<PB N="8" REF="11">
fellows and Germans, as the Romans kept &s;laves; be|cau&s;e their own countrymen had minds too enlarged and haughty to de&s;cend with a grace to the duties of &s;uch a &s;tation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good excu&s;e for a bad practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>On my honour, experience will convince you of its truth. A Frenchman neither hears, &s;ees, nor breathes, but as his ma&s;ter directs; and his whole &s;y&s;tem of conduct is compris'd in one &s;hort word, <HI>Obedience!</HI> An Engli&s;hman rea&s;ons, forms opinions, cogitates, and di&s;putes; he is the mere creature of your will: the other, a being, con&s;cious of equal importance in the univer&s;al &s;cale with your&s;elf, and is therefore your judge, whil&s;t he wears your livery, and decides on your actions with the freedom of a cen&s;or.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this in defence of a cu&s;tom I have heard you execrate, together with all the adventitious manners imported by our Travell'd Gentry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but that was at eighteen; we are always <HI>very</HI> wi&s;e at eighteen. But con&s;ider this point: we go into Italy, where the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of the people is to &s;tudy and improve the powers of Mu&s;ic: we yield to the fa&s;cination, and grow enthu&s;ia&s;ts in the charming &s;cience: we travel over France, and &s;ee the whole kingdom compo&s;ing or|naments, and inventing Fa&s;hions: we conde&s;cend to avail our&s;elves of their indu&s;try, and adopt their modes: we return to England, and find the nation intent on the mo&s;t important objects; Polity, Commerce, War, with all the Liberal Arts, employ her &s;ons; the latent &s;parks glow afre&s;h within our bo&s;oms; the &s;weet follies of the Continent im|perceptibly &s;lide away, whil&s;t Senators, State&s;men, Patri|ots and Heroes, emerge from the <HI>virt&ucirc;</HI> of Italy, and the frippery of France.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>I may as well give it up! You had always the art of placing your faults in the be&s;t light; and I can't
<PB N="9" REF="12">
help loving you, faults and all: &s;o, to &s;tart a &s;ubject which mu&s;t plea&s;e you, When do you expect Mi&s;s Hardy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the hour of expectation is pa&s;t. She is ar|rived, and I this morning had the honour of an interview at Pleadwell's. The writings were ready; and, in obedi|ence to the will of Mr. Hardy, we met to &s;ign and &s;eal.</P>

<P>No! &s;he &s;hould have &s;pirit! fire! <HI>l'air enjou&eacute;!</HI> that &s;omething, that nothing, which every body feels, and which no body can de&s;cribe, in the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s charmers of Italy and France.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanks to the par&s;imony of my father, that kept me from travel! I would not have lo&s;t my reli&s;h for true unaffected Engli&s;h beauty, to have been quarrell'd for by all the Belles of Ver&s;ailles and Florence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doric.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! thou ha&s;t no ta&s;te. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> beauty! 'Tis in&s;ipidity; it wants the ze&s;t, it wants poignancy, Frank! Why, I have known a Frenchwoman, indebted to nature for no one thing but a pair of decent eyes, reckon in her &s;uite as many Counts, Marqui&s;&s;es, and <HI>Petits Ma&icirc;|tres,</HI> as would &s;atisfy three dozen of our fir&s;t-rate toa&s;ts. I have known an Italian <HI>Marquizina</HI> make ten conque&s;ts in &s;tepping from her carriage, and carry her &s;laves from one city to another, who&s;e real intrin&s;ic beauty would have yielded to half the little <HI>Gri&s;ettes</HI> that pace your Mall on a Sunday.</P>

<P>And has Mi&s;s Hardy nothing of this?</P>

<P>If &s;he has, &s;he was plea&s;ed to keep it to her&s;elf. I was in the room half an hour before I could catch the
<PB N="10" REF="13">
colour of her eyes; and every attempt to draw her into conver&s;ation occa&s;ioned &s;o cruel an embarra&s;&s;ment, that I was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of news, French fleets, and Spani&s;h captures, with her father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>So Mi&s;s Hardy, with only beauty, mode&s;ty, and merit, is doom'd to the arms of a hu&s;band who will de&s;pi&s;e her.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sav.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Doricourt, you know very well that when the honour of a hu&s;band is <HI>locum-tenens</HI> for his heart, his wife mu&s;t be as indifferent as him&s;elf, if &s;he is not unhappy.</P>

In her mind, every &s;enti|ment gives place to the Lu&s;t of Conque&s;t, and the va|nity of being particular. The feelings of Wife, and Mother, are lo&s;t in the whirl of di&s;&s;ipation.

In her manner &s;he is free, in her morals nice. Her behaviour is undi&s;tin|gui&s;hingly polite to her Hu&s;band, and all mankind;&mdash;her &s;entiments are for their hours of retirement.

<P>Yes, claims; Lady Frances was born to be the ornament of Courts.

<P>Alive! aye, and merry. Here, wipe off the flour from my face. I was never in better health and &s;pirits in my life.&mdash;I fore&s;aw t'would do&mdash;.Why, my illne&s;s was only a fetch, Man! to make you marry Letty.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was! Ba&s;e and ungenerous! Well, Sir, you &s;hall be gratified. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart was no ob|ject either with You, or your Daughter. My fortune and name was all you de&s;ired, and the&s;e&mdash;I leave ye. My native England I &s;hall quit, nor ever behold you more. But, Lady, that in my exile I may have one con&s;olation, grant me the favour you denied la&s;t night;&mdash;let me behold

all that ma&s;k conceals, that your whole image may be im|pre&s;s'd on my heart, and chear my di&s;tant &s;olitary hours.</P>

<SPEAKER>Let.</SPEAKER>
<P>'This is the mo&s;t awful moment of my life. Oh, Doricourt, the &s;light action of taking off my Ma&s;k, &s;tamps me the mo&s;t ble&s;t or mi&s;erable of Women!</P>

<SPEAKER>Let.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not allow that. This little &s;tratagem aro&s;e from my di&s;appointment, in not having made the impre&s;|&s;ion on you I wi&s;h'd. The timidity of the Engli&s;h cha|racter threw a veil over me, you could not penetrate. You have forced me to emerge in &s;ome mea&s;ure from my natural re&s;erve, and to throw off the veil that hid me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am yet in a &s;tate of intoxication&mdash;I cannot an|&s;wer you.&mdash;Speak on, &s;weet Angel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Let.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;ee I <HI>can</HI> be any thing; chu&s;e then my cha|racter&mdash;your Ta&s;te &s;hall fix it. Shall I be an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wife?&mdash;or, breaking from the bonds of Nature and Edu|cation, &s;tep forth to the world in all the captivating glare of Foreign Manners?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall be nothing but your&s;elf&mdash;nothing can be captivating that you are not. I will not wrong your penetration, by pretending that you won my heart at the fir&s;t interview; but you have now my whole &s;oul&mdash;your per&s;on, your face, your mind, I would not exchange for tho&s;e of any other Woman breathing.</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Dog! how well he makes up for pa&s;t &s;lights! Cou&s;in Racket, I wi&s;h you a good Hu&s;band with all my heart. Mr. Flutter, I'll believe every word you &s;ay this fortnight. Mr. Villers, you and I have manag'd

<P>No, congratulate me, that I have e&s;caped with life, and give me &s;ome &s;ticking pla&s;ter&mdash;this wild cat has torn the &s;kin from my throat.</P>

<P>I expect to be among the fir&s;t who are con|gratulated&mdash;for I have recovered one Angel, while Dori|court has gained another.</P>

<P>Pho! pho! Don't talk of Angels, we &s;hall be happier by half as Mortals. Come into the next room; I have order'd out every drop of my Forty-eight, and I'll invite the whole pari&s;h of St. George's, but what we'll drink it out&mdash;except one dozen, which I &s;hall keep under three double locks, for a certain Chri&s;tening, that I fore|&s;ee will happen within this twelvemonth.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My charming Bride! It was a &s;trange perver|&s;ion of Ta&s;te, that led me to con&s;ider the delicate timidity of your deportment, as the mark of an uninform'd mind, or inelegant manners. I feel now it is to that innate mode&s;ty, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hu&s;bands owe a felicity the Married Men of other nations are &s;trangers to: it is a &s;acred veil to your own charms; it is the &s;ure&s;t bulwark to your Hu&s;band's honour; and cur&s;ed be the hour&mdash;&s;hould it ever arrive&mdash; in which <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ladies &s;hall &s;acrifice to <HI>foreign Graces</HI> the Grace of Mode&s;ty!</P>

<L>Mi&s;take me not&mdash;French red, or blanching creams,</L>
