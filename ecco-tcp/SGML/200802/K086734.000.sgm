<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE public has made &s;o little diffi|culty hitherto, in &s;wallowing nau|&s;eous, or at be&s;t, in&s;ipid ver&s;es, when they have been wrapped up in agreeable mu&s;ic; that to offer a word, either by way of defence, or apology, for the fol|lowing trifle, &s;eems altogether unne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IT will be ea&s;ily believed, that the author did not write it with a view to acquire the reputation of a genius: he mu&s;t be a &s;impleton indeed, who hopes to give people an idea of his wealth by &s;hewing them a handful of farthings. He wrote it merely to comply with the reque&s;t of a theatrical per&s;on, whom he had an inclination to oblige; it was de|&s;igned
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
and fini&s;hed in &s;omewhat le&s;s than a fortnight; and his excu&s;e for now &s;uf|fering it to appear in print (and he really thinks &s;uch an excu&s;e nece&s;&s;ary) mu&s;t be the nature of a mu&s;ical entertainment, which requires, that the words &s;hould be put into the hands of the audience, who would otherwi&s;e find it impo&s;&s;ible to ac|company the performers in what they &s;ing upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>HE is no &s;tranger to the whim&s;ical prejudice, which inclines mo&s;t people to mea&s;ure the worth of dramatic pieces by their length; and becau&s;e a mu&s;ical en|tertainment is unavoidably the &s;horte&s;t of any, makes them, for that rea&s;on, deny its being capable of any degree of merit at all. But though what he here ven|tures into the world, is neither a Tragedy, a Comedy, or even &s;o much as a Comedy of two acts; he flatters him&s;elf, there are &s;ome few, who will not condemn it, merely becau&s;e it is not, what it was not
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
de&s;igned for: he hopes they will con&s;i|der, that when he &s;at down to write it, he &s;at down to write a mu&s;ical entertain|ment; and that a certain poet and critic, who is allowed to have been a tolerable judge in &s;uch matters, has told us, no au|thor can compa&s;s more than he intends.</P>
<P>IF after this, any per&s;ons have an in|clination to find fault with it, they are heartily welcome: nay, he will &s;o far &s;ub&s;cribe to their opinion, as to confe&s;s, there are &s;ome as bad lines in it, as the wor&s;t dablers in &s;ing-&s;ong ever were guilty of; but he thought it needle&s;s to correct them, as every thing of this kind mu&s;t be ca&s;trated, in order to make it perfectly mu&s;ical; and &s;tretched and altered, to fit the &s;hape of the &s;tage. Howe|ver, he would certainly point out the exceptionable lines, to &s;hew he is not ig|norant of them; but that he takes it for granted, there will be people enough ready to &s;ave him that trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6">THUS far by way of Preface; which the author has written, only becau&s;e he is a&s;&s;ured there is nothing &s;o acceptable to the purcha&s;ers of any thing in the form of a book, now a-days, as a rea&s;onable pennyworth in print and paper; and he had a mind to avail him&s;elf of the advan|tages attending an additional half-&s;heet.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on too he might po&s;&s;ibly have attempted a Dedication; but, unfortunately, the only per&s;onages likely to patronize his performance are united in a particular &s;ociety; and he was at a lo&s;s in what manner to order their titles, &s;o as to make a proper blazon at the head of a page. However, in this place he would be under&s;tood to in&s;cribe the following rhimes to tho&s;e vagrant choire&s;ters, who, like the bards of old, &s;ing ver&s;es about the public &s;treets; and if, when they
<PB N="v" REF="7">
have thought proper to advance the fol|lowing ballads to a place in the <HI>Chimney|&s;weeper's Garland,</HI> the <HI>Sweetheart's Delight,</HI> or any other of their ingenious collections; they &s;hould, (thro' their novelty, and the prevailing argument of playhou&s;e tunes) be the means of rendering more rea&s;on|able in their demands, tho&s;e grinders of the mu&s;es, who have the con&s;cience to expect &s;ix and thirty pretty &s;ongs in one book for a halfpenny; he &s;hall think the time, and pains they co&s;t him in compo|&s;ing, very well be&s;towed.</P>
<P>TO conclude. The author thinks there is no doubt, on account of the mu&s;ic, which is admirable; and the performance, which will be excellent; but this little piece mu&s;t come off well upon the &s;tage; but after having been acquitted there, he fore&s;ees, &s;ome bu&s;y people will be for bringing it before the judges in the court of critici&s;m. Now he applies him&s;elf
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
to the &s;aid judges, requiring them to con&s;ider all &s;uch proceedings as arbitrary, at lea&s;t, if not unprecedented: He de&s;ires, that they will &s;uffer the in&s;ignificancy of this piece, to &s;creen it from their cog|nizance; and that they will not attempt to break a butterfly upon a wheel.</P>
