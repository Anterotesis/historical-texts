<P>The Author of the Prologue and Epilogue, would not have publi&s;h'd them had it not been cu&s;tomary to print them with the Play. He is very &s;en&s;ible that they can have little or no Merit in the Reading, their Effect wholly depending upon the Characters which &s;peak them, and the Novelty of introducing them. They were likewi&s;e written at a very &s;hort Warning, for the Author of the Play, had not provided the&s;e u&s;ual, and therefore nece&s;&s;ary, Parts of the Performance, which Mr. GARRICK thought proper to provide at all Events.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"TRAGEDY, as it was anciently compo&s;ed, hath been ever held the grave&s;t, morale&s;t, and mo&s;t profitable of all other Poems. Hence Philo&s;ophers, and other grave&s;t Writers, as, <HI>Cicero, Plutarch,</HI> and others, frequently cite out of Tragic Poets, both to adorn and illu&s;trate their Di&s;cour&s;e The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf, thought it not unworthy to in&s;ert a Ver&s;e of <HI>a Greek Poet</HI> into the Text of Holy Scripture.&mdash;Heretofore, Men in highe&s;t Dignity have laboured, not a little, to be thought able to compo&s;e a Tragedy. Of that Honour <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> the Elder, was no le&s;s ambitious, than be|fore, of his attaining to the Tyranny. <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar</HI> al&s;o had begun his <HI>Ajax,</HI> but unable to plea&s;e his own Judg|ment, left it unfini&s;hed. <HI>Sencca</HI> the Philo&s;opher, is by &s;ome thought the Author of tho&s;e Tragedies, at lea&s;t the be&s;t of them that go under that Name. <HI>Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> a Father of the Church, thought it not unbe&s;eeming the Sanctity of his Per&s;on to write a Tragedy, which is intitled, <HI>Chri&s;t Suffering.</HI> This is mentioned, to <HI>vindicate Tragedy</HI> from the &s;mall E&s;teem, or rather Infamy, which in the Account of many, it undergoes at this Day,"</Q></P>
<P>So &s;ar the great <HI>Milton:</HI> who &s;trengthen'd the&s;e Examples by <HI>his own.</HI> The Author hath nothing more to add, &s;ave only, that he hath aimed to write this Piece, in its <HI>e&s;&s;ential Parts,</HI> according to the Model of ancient Tragedy, &s;o far as modern Ideas and Manners wou'd permit. And he is &s;o gratefully &s;en&s;&s;ble of that favourable Reception it hath met with from the Public, that in every future Attempt, he will a&s;&s;uredly labour to merit their farther Regarcs, by keeping in his Eye the &s;ame great Originals.</P>
