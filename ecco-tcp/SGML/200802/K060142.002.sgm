A TOUR Through the ISLAND of <HI>GREAT BRITAIN.</HI> VOL. II.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I. Containing a <HI>DESCRIPTION</HI> of the North Shores of the Counties of <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Devon,</HI> and &s;ome Parts of <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire, Wilt&s;hire, Dor&s;et&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Berk&s;hire.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I NOW turned about to the Ea&s;t; and as, when I went We&s;t, I kept to the Southern Coa&s;t of this long County of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> al&s;o, &s;o in going Ea&s;t, I &s;hall keep the North Shore. The fir&s;t Place of any Note, we came to, was <HI>St. Ive</HI>'s, a pretty good Town, and grown rich by the Fi&s;hing Trade; it is &s;ituated on the We&s;t-&s;ide of a deep Bay, called <HI>St. Ives-bay,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
from the Town. This Bay is oppo&s;ite, on the Land|&s;ide, to <HI>Mount</HI>'s-<HI>bay,</HI> which I &s;poke of in my la&s;t; but it is filled up with Sands, and here is but very little Trade in any thing el&s;e but <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Slate.</P>
<P>It is a very plea&s;ant View we have at <HI>Madern-hills,</HI> and the Plain by them, in the Way from the <HI>Land's-end</HI> to <HI>St. Ives</HI>; where we have a Pro&s;pect of the Ocean at the <HI>Land's-end,</HI> We&s;t; of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Chanel at <HI>Mount's-bay,</HI> South; and the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Chanel, or <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, North. At <HI>St. Ives</HI> the Land between the Two Bays, being not above Four or Five Miles over, is &s;o &s;ituated, that upon the Hill neither of the Two Seas are above Three Miles off, and very plain to be &s;een; and &s;o likewi&s;e, in a clear Day, are the I&s;lands of <HI>Scilly,</HI> tho' above 30 Miles off.</P>
<P>The Country from hence to <HI>Pad&s;tow</HI> is both fruit|ful and plea&s;ant, and &s;everal Hou&s;es of Gentlemen are &s;een as we pa&s;s; the Sands al&s;o are very agreeable to the Eye, and to travel upon: among the Gentle|mens Hou&s;es is <HI>Lanhidrock,</HI> the Seat of the Earls of <HI>Radnor,</HI> who are Barons of <HI>Truro,</HI> and were &s;o, long before they obtained the Title of <HI>Radnor</HI>; al&s;o a good Hou&s;e belonging to the antient Family of <HI>Trefu&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>The Hills are fruitful of Tin, Copper and Lead, all the Way on our Right-hand; the Product of which is carried all to the other Shore; &s;o that we &s;hall have little to &s;ay of it here. The chief Bu&s;ine&s;s on this Shore is the Herring Fi&s;hing; the Herrings about <HI>October</HI> come driving up the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, and from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in prodigious Shoals, and beat all upon this Coa&s;t as high as <HI>Bidiford</HI> and <HI>Barn|&s;table</HI> in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and are caught in great Quan|tities by the Fi&s;hermen, chiefly on Account of the Merchants of <HI>Falmouth, Foy, Plymouth,</HI> and other Ports on the South.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"><HI>St. Michael's,</HI> or <HI>Modi&s;hole,</HI> a mean Portreeve Borough, is not now remarkable, but was of great Note in the <HI>Saxon</HI> Time, and has &s;till a Market weekly, and a yearly Fair.</P>
<P>We then came to <HI>St. Columb's,</HI> a little Market-town, a Lord&s;hip belonging to the <HI>Arundels</HI> of <HI>Wardour</HI>; &s;o called, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the <HI>Arundels</HI> of <HI>Trerice</HI> in this County; which Family, e&s;pou&s;ing the King's Side in the Civil Wars, &s;uffered much, and was innobled in <HI>Charles</HI> II.'s Time. The <HI>Wardour</HI> Family was likewi&s;e loyal, and &s;uffered in the &s;ame Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Near this Place is a Hill, which has a Rampire on the Summit of it, and a Cau&s;eway leading to it. 'Tis an old <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Camp, and called <HI>Ca&s;tellum Danis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pad&s;tow</HI> is a large Town, and &s;tands on a very good Harbour for &s;uch Shipping as u&s;e the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Trade. The Harbour is the Mouth of the River <HI>Camel,</HI> or <HI>Camal,</HI> which ri&s;ing at <HI>Camelford,</HI> runs down by <HI>Bodmyn</HI> to <HI>Wadbridge,</HI> a little Town, where a large Stone Bridge of about Eight Arches is built by the Contributions of the Country Gentle|men, at the Motion, and under the Direction, of one <HI>Nicolas Lovibond,</HI> Vicar of <HI>Wadbridge,</HI> the Pa&s;&s;age over the River before being very dangerous, and having occa&s;ioned the Lo&s;s of &s;ome Lives, as well as Goods.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;age from this Town of <HI>Pad&s;tow</HI> to <HI>Ire|land</HI> is &s;aid, by Writers, to be no more than Twenty-four Hours; but this, if ever done, hat been &s;o &s;el|dom, that it ought not to be mentioned as generally the Ca&s;e; for I believe not one in Twenty-four Ships makes its Voyage in &s;o few Hours; and that they are oftener Five or Six Days in the Pa&s;&s;age. Here is a very antient Seat, like a Ca&s;tle, of a Family of the Name of <HI>Prideaux,</HI> the Chief of which, in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, built this noble Seat there.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">Higher within the Land lies the Market and Borough Town of <HI>Bodmyn,</HI> formerly one of the Coining Towns of Tin, till it lo&s;t that Privilege to <HI>Le&s;twithyel:</HI> However it &s;till injoys &s;everal Ad|vantages, &s;ome of which are Tokens of its Anti|quity. It is pretty large, and &s;tands between two Hills in a good Air. It had antiently &s;everal Churches, of which now only one remains, which belonged to the Priory, and is at pre&s;ent the Pari&s;h Church. A kind of Carnival is kept here yearly, in <HI>July,</HI> whither great Numbers of People re&s;ort.</P>
<P>The Coinage Towns were, in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, Four; namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Le&s;kard,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Le&s;twithyel,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Truro,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Hel&s;ton.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Since that, in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time, was added <HI>Pen&s;ance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Camelford</HI> is a mean, but antient Borough-town. Here the River <HI>Camel</HI> ri&s;es, which takes its Name from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Cam, i. e.</HI> crooked. It has not either Church or Chapel in it, nor ever had. It is only remarkable for two great Battles which were fought here, one between King <HI>Arthur</HI> and his Nephew <HI>Mordred,</HI> and the other between the <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>The Borough of <HI>Bo&s;&s;iney,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Trevena,</HI> is but a &s;mall Village. It is famous only for the &s;plendid Ruins of an impregnable Ca&s;tle, built on the Rock, which &s;tood partly on the Continent, and partly on an I&s;land, joined together by a Draw|bridge. The Ca&s;tle was the Seat of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Princes, and &s;ince, of the Dukes of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> And, 'tis &s;aid, <HI>Arthur</HI> was born here, and died in one of the above-mentioned Battles near <HI>Camelford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> which is a Corruption of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Lan&s;tuphadon,</HI> i. e. <HI>St. Stephen</HI>'s Church; is a Market and Borough-town, pretty neat, and is
<PB N="5" REF="6">
&s;ituate on a ri&s;ing Ground, at the Extremity of the County, on the Borders of <HI>Devon&s;hire:</HI> great Part of it is very old, ragged and decayed.</P>
<P>When <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall</HI> had the Govern|ment of this County, this was a Frontier Town, well walled about, and fortified, and had al&s;o a noble Ca&s;tle, which, from its Strength, was called <HI>Ca&s;tle Terrible.</HI> The Inhabitants, for the Defence and Repair of it, held formerly the Lands here by <HI>Ca&s;tle-guard.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s good Fortune failed him, and he was forced by <HI>Fairfax</HI> to di&s;band his Army.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is <HI>Henge&s;ton-hill,</HI> which pro|duces a great Plenty of <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Diamonds. The <HI>Corni&s;h Britons</HI> joined the <HI>Danes</HI> here, to drive out the <HI>Saxons</HI> from <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>; but were totally de|feated by <HI>Egbert</HI> in 831, which, 'tis conjectured, gives the Name of <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> to this Hill, in Comme|moration of their fir&s;t Leader.</P>
<P><HI>Newport</HI> is a little Village adjoining, and was formerly Part of <HI>Launce&s;ton</HI>; and yet &s;ends Two Members to Parliament. And indeed there are no le&s;s than Forty-four, and the Number of Electors are &s;o few in many of the Places, that an Admi|ni&s;tration, of which Side &s;oever it be, as to Party, has u&s;ually a great Reliance on the Elections in this County every new Parliament, in order to obtain a Majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons: For Forty-four Members from hence, and Forty-five from an|other Part of the I&s;land, who generally go one way, make no &s;mall Figure in a Que&s;tion: And in this Ca&s;e it may not be improperly ob&s;erved, that the two Extremities of the I&s;land, let the other Parts go as they will, are generally united in the &s;ame way of Thinking, or at lea&s;t of Acting, in all Political Debates, and are likely to be &s;o in all Times to come.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">There is a fine Image or Figure of <HI>Mary Magda|len,</HI> upon the Tower of the Church at <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> to which the Papi&s;ts fail not to pay Reverence, as they pa&s;s by. There is no Tin, Copper or Lead found hereabouts, as I could hear, nor any Manu|facture in the Place. There are a pretty many Attorneys here, who manage Bu&s;ine&s;s for the re&s;t of their Fraternity at the A&s;&s;izes: As to Trade, it has not much to boa&s;t of, and yet there are People enough in it to excu&s;e tho&s;e who call it a populous Place. There is a long Nook of the County runs North from this Place, called the <HI>Hundred of</HI> Strat|ton, in which there is one Market-town, named <HI>Stratton</HI>; but it has nothing in or about it worth remarking, except only <HI>Stow-hou&s;e,</HI> built by the Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and as to its Fini&s;hings within, not inferior to any in <HI>Eng|land.</HI> The Carvings, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Chapel; the grand Alcove, and &s;ome of the be&s;t Rooms, were done by the Hand of <HI>Michael Chuke,</HI> and are not excelled by <HI>Gibbon</HI> him&s;elf. The Land&s;chape, and Sea-pieces, of which there were a great Number, (particularly in the great Stairs, a Pro&s;pect of <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> containing 22 Feet by 12) were the Work of <HI>Vandei&s;t.</HI> The Situation of this &s;tately Palace renders it a di&s;agreeable Habitation; for which Rea|&s;on the Owners have di&s;po&s;ed of the Materials, and it is now (<HI>Nov.</HI> 1739) pulling to Pieces. Near this Town, Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> defeated the Parliament Forces under the Command of Major-General <HI>Chud|leigh,</HI> and took him Pri&s;oner; for which he was made Baron <HI>Stratton.</HI> 'Tis &s;aid, the Place where this Bat|tle was fought, produced a prodigious Crop of Barley of 10 or 12 Ears on a Stalk, the next Year.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Bodmyn,</HI> is to be &s;een the Set of monumental Stones, called <HI>The Hurlers</HI>; which Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> &s;ays, are, out of Doubt, Remains of an antient <HI>Druid</HI> Temple. Probably they are called by
<PB N="7" REF="8">
this Name, from the Game of Hurling, practi&s;ed in the&s;e Parts; the Country People giving them that for want of a better; and indeed, it is &s;aid, that they have a &s;uper&s;titious Notion, that they were once Men, who were transformed into Stones, for playing at this Sport on a <HI>Sunday.</HI> They are oblong, rude, unhewn Stones, pitched on one End upon the Ground. They &s;tand on a Down in Three Circles, the Centres whereof are in a right Line, the middle-mo&s;t Circle the greate&s;t.</P>
<P>Now I have mentioned the <HI>Hurlers,</HI> I mu&s;t take the Opportunity to de&s;cribe the <HI>Hurling Match</HI>; for which the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Men are &s;o particularly famous, and which is one of their principal Recreations, tho' bar|barous enough. A Silver Ball is generally the Prize on the&s;e Occa&s;ions. The Match is made in different Manners: for &s;ometimes the Challenge is by Twenty or Thirty Men on a Side, and no others are to inter|fere; at other times, when a great Number of People are a&s;&s;embled at a <HI>Wake</HI> or <HI>Church-Ale,</HI> the Word is given out, <HI>That</HI> Johns, Wills, <HI>and</HI> Toms, <HI>will oppo&s;e all other Names:</HI> or, at other times, <HI>That</HI> Elde&s;t <HI>or</HI> Seconds <HI>are again&s;t all</HI> Younger Sons. And &s;o the Ball is thrown up, and becomes the Property of that Party which carries it away to the Goal &s;et for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But another kind of <HI>Hurling</HI> is, when an <HI>Out-ball,</HI> as they call it, is thrown up; and the&s;e Matches are generally made by Two or more neighbouring Gentle|men, who, at a Day agreed on, bring each of them the Men of Two, Three, or more Pari&s;hes; and the Goals are then &s;et, perhaps, Four or Five Miles di&s;tant, at &s;ome Gentlemens Hou&s;es, Towns, or the like: and here nothing is &s;aid about Matching in Number, or otherwi&s;e; but the Ball is thrown up, and a bloody Skirmi&s;h generally en&s;ues: no Bu&s;hes, Briers, Bogs, Mud-pools, Rivers, or any other Impediments, hinder their Cour&s;e, nor any
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Friend&s;hip, Relation, or former Obligation, in the lea&s;t, abates their Fury. The Party prevailing ge|nerally pre&s;ent the Ball to the Gentlemen who brought them on, as a Trophy; and he, in Return, &s;ets open his Cellar-doors, where they wa&s;h away the Blood from their No&s;es, and apply a Bal&s;am to their Brui&s;es.</P>
<P>The Wre&s;tling in <HI>Cornwall</HI> is, indeed, a much more manly and generous Exerci&s;e; and that Clo|&s;ure, which they call the <HI>Corni&s;h Hug,</HI> has made them eminent in the Wre&s;tling Rings all over <HI>Eng|land</HI>; as the <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> Men are, for their Dexterity at the Hand and Foot, and throwing up the Heels of their Adver&s;ary, without taking hold of him.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the River <HI>Tamar,</HI> about Two Miles from <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> we enter the great County of <HI>Devon</HI>; and as it is in the mo&s;t wild and barren Part of it, and where formerly Tin Mines were found, tho' now they are either quite exhau&s;ted, or not to be worked without more Charge than Profit; &s;o we mu&s;t expect it a little to re&s;emble its neighbour County.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Tamar</HI> here abounds with fre&s;h Salmon, which are &s;o exceeding fat and good, that they are e&s;teemed in both Counties above the Fi&s;h of the &s;ame Kind found in other Places; and the Quantity is &s;o great, as &s;upplies the Country in abundance. This is occa&s;ioned by the Mouth of the River being &s;o very large, and the Water &s;o deep for Two Leagues be|fore it opens into <HI>Plymouth Sound,</HI> that the Fi&s;h have a &s;ecure Retreat in the &s;alt Water for their Harbour and Shelter, and from thence they &s;hoot up into the fre&s;h Water, in va&s;t Numbers, to ca&s;t their Spawn.</P>
<P>We ride but a few Miles in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> before we find a different Face in &s;everal re&s;pects: As, 1. More People than in <HI>Cornwall:</HI> 2. Larger Towns: 3. The People all bu&s;y, and in full Imploy upon their Manufactures.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">At the uppermo&s;t and extreme Part of the County North-we&s;t, runs a large Promontory into the Sea beyond all the Land on either Side, whether of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> or of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> This they would fain have called <HI>Hercules</HI>'s <HI>Promontory</HI>; but the hone&s;t Sailors, and, after them, the plain Country People, call it <HI>Hartland Point,</HI> or <HI>Hearty Point,</HI> from the Town of <HI>Hartland,</HI> which &s;tands ju&s;t within the Shore, and is &s;ituated on the utmo&s;t Edge of the County of <HI>Devon:</HI> It is a Market-town of good Re&s;ort, the People coming con&s;tantly to it out of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the Fi&s;her-boats of <HI>Barn&s;table, Bidiford,</HI> and the other Towns on the Coa&s;ts, lying often un|der the <HI>Lee,</HI> as they call it, of the&s;e Rocks, for Shelter from the South-we&s;t, or South-ea&s;t Winds; at which time the Seamen go on Shore here, and &s;upply them&s;elves with Provi&s;ions: nor is the Town unconcerned in that gainful Fi&s;hing-trade, which is carried on for the Herrings on this Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>From this Point or Promontory, the Land falling away for &s;ome Miles, makes a Gulph or Bay, which reaching to the Head-land, or Point of <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> Haven, is called from thence <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> Bay. Into this Bay, or at the We&s;t-end of it, the Rivers <HI>Taw</HI> and <HI>Towridge</HI> empty them&s;elves at one Mouth; and it is very particular, that as Two Rivers join in One Chanel, &s;o here are Two great trading Towns in One Port, a thing, which, as it is not u&s;ual, &s;o I cannot &s;ay is an Advantage to any of them; for it naturally follows, that they rival one another, and le&s;&s;en both; whereas, had they been joined together in one Town, or were it po&s;&s;ible to join them, they would make the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Town, or City rather, in all this Part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Towns of <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> and <HI>Bidiford,</HI> the fir&s;t, the mo&s;t antient; the la&s;t, the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing; the Harbour or River is, in its En|trance, the &s;ame to both; and when they part,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the <HI>Towridge</HI> turns to the Right, or South-we&s;t, and the <HI>Taw</HI> to the South-ea&s;t; yet they &s;eem to be both &s;o &s;afe, &s;o ea&s;y in the Chanel, &s;o equally good with re&s;pect to Shipping, and &s;o equidi&s;tant from the Sea, that neither Town complains of the Bounty of the Sea to them, or their Situation by Land; and yet of late Years the Town of <HI>Bidiford</HI> has flouri&s;hed, and the Town of <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> rather declined.</P>
<P><HI>Bidiford</HI> is a clean, well-built Town; the more antient Street, which lies next the River, is very plea&s;ant, where is the Bridge, a very noble Quay, and the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; it is al&s;o very well built and populous, and fronts the River for above three Quarters of a Mile: But be&s;ides this, there is a new &s;pacious Street, which runs North and South, or rather North-we&s;t, and South-ea&s;t, a great Length, broad as the <HI>High-Street</HI> of <HI>Exeter,</HI> well-built, and inhabited with con&s;iderable and wealthy Merchants, who traffick to mo&s;t Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Here, as is to be &s;een in almo&s;t all the Market-towns of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> is a very large and well-fini&s;hed Meeting-hou&s;e, and, by the Multitude of People which I &s;aw come out of it, I thought all the Town had gone thither, and began to inquire for the Church: but I found that al&s;o large, &s;pacious, and filled with People of the be&s;t Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The Trade of this Town, as well as of all the Towns on this Coa&s;t, being very much in Fi&s;h, I ob&s;erved that &s;everal Ships were imployed to go to <HI>Liverpool,</HI> and up the River <HI>Mer&s;ey</HI> to <HI>Warrington,</HI> to fetch the Rock Salt, which is found in that County, (and of which I &s;hall &s;ay more in my Remarks on tho&s;e Parts) to <HI>Bidiford</HI> and <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> and there di&s;&s;olve it into Brine in the Sea-water, joining the Strength of two Bodies in one, and then boil it up again into a new Salt, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> do by that of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> This is ju&s;tly called <HI>Salt upon Salt,</HI> and with this they cure their Herrings.
<PB N="11" REF="12">
As this is a Trade which can be but of few Years &s;tanding, becau&s;e the Rock Salt it&s;elf has not been di&s;covered in <HI>England</HI> many Years; &s;o the Difference in curing the Fi&s;h has been &s;uch, that the Demand for them has con&s;iderably increa&s;ed in foreign Markets.</P>
<P>Here is a very fine Stone Bridge over the River, built in the 14th Century, on 24 <HI>Gothick</HI> Arches, all uniform and regular, and very good Workman&s;hip of the kind. The&s;e Arches are indeed beautiful and &s;tately; but what a late Author &s;ays, that one of them is &s;o big, that a Ship of 60 Tons may &s;ail under it, is a Mi&s;take, no &s;uch thing being practicable, either at <HI>London</HI> Bridge, <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> Bridge, or even at <HI>York,</HI> where the large&s;t Arch in <HI>England</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>As <HI>Bidiford</HI> has a fine Bridge over the <HI>Towridge,</HI> &s;o <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> has a very noble one over the <HI>Taw,</HI> and tho' not longer, is counted larger and &s;tronger than the other. The&s;e two rival Towns are really very con&s;iderable; both of them have a large Share in the Trade to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in the Herring-fi&s;hery, and in a Trade to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America</HI>; if <HI>Bidiford</HI> cures more Fi&s;h, <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> imports more Wine, and other Merchandizes; they are both e&s;tabli&s;hed Ports for landing Wool from <HI>Ireland</HI>; of which by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If <HI>Bidiford</HI> has a greater Number of Merchants, <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> has a greater Commerce within Land, by its great Market for <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wool and Yarn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the Serge-markets of <HI>Tiverton</HI> and <HI>Exeter,</HI> who come up hither to buy. So that, in a word, <HI>Barn|&s;table,</HI> tho' it has lo&s;t Ground to <HI>Bidiford,</HI> yet, take it in all its Trade completely, is full as con&s;iderable as <HI>Bidiford</HI>; only, that perhaps it was formerly far &s;upe|rior to it, and the other has ri&s;en up to be its Match.</P>
<P><HI>Barn&s;table</HI> is a large, well-built Town, &s;eated among the Hills. It is more populous than <HI>Bidi|ford,</HI> but not better built, and &s;tands lower; in&s;o|much, that at High-water in Spring-tides it is, in a manner, &s;urrounded with Water. The Bridge was
<PB N="12" REF="13">
built by the generous Benefaction of one <HI>Stamford,</HI> a Citizen and Merchant of <HI>London,</HI> who, it &s;eems, was not a Native of the Place; but by trading here to his Gain, had Kindne&s;s enough for the Town, to confer that valuable Benefit upon them. It was formerly walled in, and had a Ca&s;tle and a Priory. 'Tis governed by a Mayor and Twenty-four Bur|ge&s;&s;es, whereof Two are Aldermen. It has al&s;o an High-Steward, and Recorder.</P>
<P>The Bridge at <HI>Bidiford,</HI> as above, was likewi&s;e a Gift; but was, as they &s;ay, done by Collections among the Clergy, by Grant of Indulgences, and the like Church Management: However, both the Towns are infinitely obliged to the Benefactors; and we wi&s;h no wor&s;e U&s;e had ever been made of Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>Behind <HI>Bidiford,</HI> as we come from <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> are &s;everal good Towns, tho' I ob&s;erved, that the Country was wild and barren; as <HI>Tavi&s;tock, Torrington,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Tavi&s;tock</HI> is &s;ituate on the <HI>Tavy,</HI> among Springs, and is a large Town pretty well built. The Abbot of this Place &s;at in Parliament, built a Church of 126 Yards long, &s;pacious Cloi&s;ters, and a Chapter-hou&s;e, with 36 Stalls, which are all now de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Torrington</HI> is &s;ituated on the &s;ame River that <HI>Bidiford</HI> &s;tands upon. It has a large &s;pacious Church, with a Library in it; and was for &s;ome time the Re&s;idence of <HI>Margaret,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Henry</HI> VII.</P>
<P>Another Town in this Part of the Country is <HI>Okehampton,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Okington,</HI> a good Market and Borough-town, governed by Eight principal Burge&s;&s;es, and as many A&s;&s;i&s;tants: it is a manufacturing Town, as all the Towns this way now are, and pretty rich; but in the Records of Antiquity it appears to have been much more con&s;iderable than it is now, having 92 Knights Fees belonging to it.</P>
<P>A little above <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> N. E. upon the Coa&s;t, &s;tands a noted Market and Port-town, called <HI>Ilford|comb,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="14">
a Place of good Trade, populous and rich; which is owing to its having a very good Harbour and Road for Ships, which affords a &s;afe Shelter for Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Ireland,</HI> when in bad Weather they can|not, without the extreme&s;t Hazard, run into the Mouth of the <HI>Taw,</HI> which they call <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> Wa|ter; and this is one Rea&s;on, that the Merchants at <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> do much of their Bu&s;ine&s;s at this Port of <HI>Ilfordcomb.</HI></P>
<P>The Harbour of this Town was maintain'd former|ly at the private Expence of the Ance&s;tors of Sir <HI>Bourchier Wrey,</HI> Bart. Lord of the Manor; and the Quay or Pier of it contains in Length upwards of 850 Feet, and in Height upwards of Forty; and the Warp-hou&s;e, Light-hou&s;e, Pilot-boats, and Taw-boats belonging to the Port, were at fir&s;t founded and built, and con&s;tantly repaired and maintained, by that worthy Family, without any A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but &s;ome &s;mall Acknowledgments paid to them as Lords of the Manor. But by Length of Time, and Vio|lence of the Sea, the Quay was very much &s;unk and impair'd, the Warp and Warp-hou&s;e, by long U&s;age, was gone to Decay, and the Boats for Piloting and Towing were much out of Repair, and the &s;mall Duties and Acknowlegements to Sir <HI>Bour|chier</HI> &s;inking, and being frequently unpaid; to remedy all the&s;e Evils, an Act pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Anno</HI> 1731, <HI>George</HI> II. for repairing, and keeping in Repair, and inlarging the Piers and Harbour, and for the Support of the Light and Light-hou&s;e, the Warp and Warp-hou&s;e, and the Pilot, and Towing-boats, as above-men|tioned: &s;o that by this means the Harbour of <HI>Il|fordcomb</HI> is likely to continue the u&s;eful and conve|nient Port it has been for &s;o many Years pa&s;t, to the End of Time.</P>
<P>Antiquity tells us long Stories of the <HI>Danes</HI> land|ing on this Coa&s;t; of <HI>Hubba</HI> the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> King being &s;lain at <HI>Kennith</HI> Ca&s;tle, between this Place and the
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Mouth of the <HI>Taw</HI> and <HI>Towridge</HI>; and that the Place was called <HI>Hubbe&s;tow</HI> from his being buried there: but I could not hear either of this Ca&s;tle, or Burial-place, or &s;o much as the Ruins of them.</P>
<P>The Sea-coa&s;t in this Country runs a little farther Ea&s;t by North; but nothing of Moment is to be &s;een there, except Fi&s;hing-towns, and little Creeks, on which are Two Market-towns, <HI>viz. Combemer|ton</HI> and <HI>Porlock,</HI> till we came to <HI>Minehead.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving the Coa&s;t in our Journey Southward, we came to the great River <HI>Ex</HI> or <HI>I&s;ca,</HI> which ri&s;es in the Hills on the North Side of the County, and, like the <HI>Tamar,</HI> begins within Four or Five Miles of the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea. The Country it ri&s;es in is called <HI>Exmore: Camden</HI> &s;ays it is a filthy, barren Ground; and indeed &s;o it is: but as &s;oon as the <HI>Ex</HI> comes off from the Moors and hilly Country, and de&s;cends into the lower Grounds, we found an Alteration; for then we &s;aw <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> in its other Countenance, culti|vated, populous and fruitful, and continuing &s;o till we came to <HI>Tiverton.</HI></P>
<P>Next to <HI>Exeter,</HI> this is the greate&s;t manufacture|ing Town in the County, and, of all the inland Towns, is likewi&s;e next to it in Wealth, and Num|ber of People; it &s;tands on the River <HI>Ex,</HI> and has over it an old Stone Bridge, with another over the little River <HI>Loman,</HI> which immediately after falls into the <HI>Ex</HI> ju&s;t below the Town. Antiquity &s;ays, be|fore tho&s;e Bridges were built, there were two Fords here, one thro' each River; and that the Town was from thence called <HI>Twyfordton,</HI> that is, the Town upon the two Fords; and &s;o, by abbreviating the Sounds, <HI>Twy-for-ton,</HI> then <HI>Tiverton.</HI></P>
<P>This Town has been a remarkable Sufferer by Fire; for in the Year 1598. <HI>April</HI> 3. it was con&s;um'd on a &s;udden; <HI>Aug.</HI> 5. 1612, it was again burnt down; and <HI>July</HI> 5. 1731, another dreadful Fire de&s;troyed there 200 of the be&s;t Hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">An Act pa&s;&s;ed on this &s;ad Occa&s;ion, <HI>Anno</HI> 1732, for the more ea&s;y rebuilding of the Town, and determining Differences on that Account; and it injoins, that the new-built Hou&s;es &s;hall be cover'd with Lead, Slate, or Tile, and not Thatch; that perilous Trades &s;hall not be exerci&s;ed in publick Streets; that no Stacks of Hay, Straw, Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall be erected at or near the publick Parts of the Town; that Fire-Engines may be bought by the Guardians of the Poor; that Hou&s;es may be demoli&s;hed to &s;top any future Fire: that the Streets and Pa&s;&s;ages of the Town may be in|larged, and particular Hou&s;es pulled down for that Purpo&s;e, with other u&s;eful Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>An Act al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Anno</HI> 1733, for making a Chapel, built by the Sub&s;cription of the Inhabitants of <HI>Tiver|ton,</HI> a perpetual Cure; and for providing a Main|tenance for the Mini&s;ters who &s;hall officiate in it; for, as the Preamble to the Act ob&s;erves, the Pari&s;h Church was not near capacious enough to receive the Inhabitants of the Pari&s;h. The late Sir <HI>William Wyndham</HI> was a great Encourager and Promoter of this new Chapel at its fir&s;t Erection.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of <HI>Tiverton</HI> is the Free-School, at the Ea&s;t Entrance into the Town, a noble Building, but a much nobler Foundation; it was erected by one <HI>Peter Blundel,</HI> a Clothier, and a Lover of Learn|ing, who u&s;ed the Saying of <HI>William of Wickham</HI> to the King, when he founded the Royal School at <HI>Winche&s;ter, viz.</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if he was not him&s;elf a Scholar, he would be the Occa&s;ion of making more Scholars than any Scholar in <HI>England</HI>;"</Q> to which End he founded this School.
He has endow'd it &s;o liberally, that, I was told, the Schoolma&s;ter has at lea&s;t Sixty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> be&s;ides a very good Hou&s;e to live in, and the Advantage of Scholars not on the Foundation; and that the U&s;her has in Pro|portion. To this the generous Founder added Two Fellow&s;hips, and Two Scholar&s;hips, which he gave
<PB N="16" REF="17">
the Maintenance for to <HI>Sydney</HI> College in <HI>Cambridge</HI>; and One Fellow&s;hip, and Two Scholar&s;hips, to <HI>Baliol</HI> College in <HI>Oxford</HI>; all which are appointed for the Scholars bred up in this School.</P>
<P>As this is the chief Nur&s;ery of almo&s;t all the young Gentry of the&s;e We&s;tern Parts, the Profit ari&s;ing to the Ma&s;ter from Boarders, and the liberal Benefactions of the Parents, added to the Salary before-mention'd, render it a Preferment &s;uitable to a Man of the be&s;t Parts and Learning; and as the Tru&s;tees are Gentlemen of great Honour, it is generally di&s;po&s;ed of to the mo&s;t worthy Candidate. Mr. <HI>Rayner</HI> pre&s;ided in it for many Years, with very great Applau&s;e, and dy'd about <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written <HI>Anno</HI> 1740.</NOTE> Twelve Years ago. To him &s;ucceeded Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>; after him Mr. <HI>Jones</HI>; next Mr. <HI>We&s;ley,</HI> once U&s;her of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> School, as noted for his poetical Performances, as his Brothers <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> are for their being at the Head of the new Sectari&s;ts, who are called <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI>; and he dying <HI>Nov.</HI> 1739, is &s;ucceeded by Mr. <HI>Daddo.</HI> Thus hath it, in Twelve Years time, undergone Five different Regimens; and if it be con&s;ider'd, that every Change introduces &s;ome Difference in the Method of Teaching and Di&s;ci|pline, it will be no Surprize, that the School is &s;ome|thing &s;unk in its former Reputation. The pre&s;ent Ma&s;ter is Fellow of <HI>Baliol</HI> College, <HI>Oxford,</HI> had his Education here, and from his great Abilities, and good Oeconomy, (in which la&s;t re&s;pect a great Com|plaint lay again&s;t his Predece&s;&s;or) the School is like to retrieve its former flouri&s;hing Condition.</P>
<P>The great Number of Gentlemens Sons &s;ent hi|ther for their Education, as I have hinted, is no &s;mall Advantage to the Town likewi&s;e; and this, join'd with the bri&s;k Trade carried on here, renders it &s;o flouri&s;hing, that notwith&s;tanding the dreadful Calamity it underwent by the Fire in 1731, which
<PB N="17" REF="18">
almo&s;t totally con&s;umed it, it is already very elegantly rebuilt; and carries very few other Marks of this Deva&s;tation, than the Magnificence and Beauty of the new Structures.</P>
<P>As this is a manufacturing Country, we found the People here all fully imploy'd, and very few, if any, out of Work.</P>
<P>From this Town there is little belonging to <HI>Devon|&s;hire</HI> but what has been &s;poken of, except what lies in the Road to <HI>Taunton,</HI> which we took next, where we meet with the River <HI>Columb,</HI> which ri&s;es al&s;o in the utmo&s;t Limits of the County towards <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> and gives Name to &s;o many Towns on its Banks, that it leaves no room to doubt of its own Name being right; &s;uch are <HI>Columb-David</HI>'s, <HI>Ufco|lumb, Columb&s;tock,</HI> and <HI>Columbton</HI>; the la&s;t is a Mar|ket-town, and they are all full of Manufacturers depending much on the Ma&s;ter-manufacturers of <HI>Tiverton.</HI></P>
<P>Before we leave <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> it will not be ami&s;s to take Notice of <HI>Lundy</HI> I&s;land, which, tho' 50 Miles from <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> North-we&s;tward, is much mote remote from any other Continent. 'Tis but Five Miles long, and Two broad; but &s;o &s;urround|ed with inacce&s;&s;ible Rocks, that there is but one &s;mall Entrance into it, where Two Men can &s;carce go abrea&s;t. Tho' this I&s;land lies &s;o far in the Sea, it has the Advantage of &s;everal Springs of fre&s;h Water.</P>
<P>With the Town of <HI>Tiverton</HI> we leave the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> and entering <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> have really a View of a different Country from <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>; for at <HI>Wellington,</HI> the fir&s;t Town we came to in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> tho' partly imployed in Manufacture|ing too, we were immediately &s;urrounded with Beg|gars, to &s;uch a Degree, that we had &s;ome Difficulty to keep them from under our Hor&s;es Heels. I was
<PB N="18" REF="19">
a&s;toni&s;h'd at &s;uch a Sight, in a Country where the People were &s;o generally full of Work; for in <HI>Corn|wall,</HI> where there are hardly any Manufacturers, and abundance of Poor, we never found any like this.</P>
<P><HI>Wellington</HI> is a low dirty Place, and is only re|markable for having been the Place of Re&s;idence of the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Popham,</HI> in the Reigns of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> I. who was buried here. They talk much of one <HI>Salkeld,</HI> who was converted from Popery by King <HI>James</HI> I. and made Mini&s;ter of this Place. He called him&s;elf, in Compliment to the King, <HI>The Royal Convert</HI>; who, in return, complimented him with the Title of the <HI>Learned Salkeld,</HI> which, by-the-bye, reflected no bad Com|pliment on him&s;elf, for having converted a learned Man.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> joins to the North-ea&s;t Part of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and takes its Name from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Gladyr Haf,</HI> which &s;ignifies Summer-Country, and &s;o the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> call it in their Language to this Day. I touch'd only upon one Point of the County in my la&s;t, as I went We&s;tward. The whole County is worth a more particular Account, than can be given within the Space of a Letter.</P>
<P>From <HI>Wellington</HI> we came to <HI>Taunton,</HI> leaving <HI>Blackdown Hills</HI> on our Right, and <HI>Ilmin&s;ter</HI> behind them Southward, a Market-town, fam'd for its very good Church, and a &s;tately Monument erected in it to <HI>Nicolas Wadham,</HI> and <HI>Dorothy,</HI> his Wife, Founders of <HI>Wadham</HI> College, <HI>Oxon.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Taunton</HI> lies that rich Track of Ground, vulgarly called <HI>Taunton-dean.</HI> This large, wealthy, and very populous Town takes its Name from the River <HI>Tone,</HI> whereon it is &s;ituated. One of the chief Manufacturers here told us, That there was at that time &s;o good a Trade in the Town, that they had eleven hundred Looms going for the Weaving of Sagathies, Duroys, and &s;uch kind of Stuffs; and
<PB N="19" REF="20">
that not one of tho&s;e Looms wanted Work: he added, That there was not a Child in the Town, or in the Villages round it, of above Five Years old, but, if it was not neglected by its Parents, and un|taught, could earn its own Bread. This was what I never met with in any Place in <HI>England,</HI> except at <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>The Election of Members here, is by tho&s;e whom they call Pot-Walloners, that is to &s;ay, Every In|habitant, whether Hou&s;e-keeper or Lodger, who dre&s;&s;es his own Victuals: to make out which, &s;eve|ral Inmates or Lodgers will, &s;ome little time before the Election, bring out their Pots, and make Fires in the Street, and boil their Victuals in the Sight of their Neighbours, that their Votes may not be called in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>There are Two large Pari&s;h Churches in this Town, and Two or Three Meeting-hou&s;es, one of which is &s;aid to be the large&s;t in the County. The Inhabitants have been noted for Di&s;&s;enters principal|ly; for <HI>Taunton</HI> was always counted a Seminary for &s;uch. They &s;uffer'd much in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Rebellion, but paid King <HI>James</HI> home for the Cruel|ty exerci&s;ed by <HI>Jefferies</HI> among them; for when the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> arriv'd, the whole Town ran in to him, with &s;o univer&s;al a Joy, that it was thought, if he had wanted it, he might have rai&s;ed a little Army there, and in the adjacent Part of the Country.</P>
<P>There is a kind of College, or Academy, for the Di&s;&s;enters in this Town; and it is by far the greate&s;t Town in all this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>From <HI>Taunton</HI> we went North to take a View of the Coa&s;t. <HI>Exmore,</HI> of which mention was made above, where the River <HI>Ex</HI> ri&s;es, lies in the Way, Part of it in this County, and extending to the Sea Side: it gives, indeed, but a melancholy View, be|ing a va&s;t Track of barren and de&s;olate Lands; yet on the Coa&s;t there are &s;ome very good Sea-ports.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21"><HI>Porlock,</HI> mentioned before, on the utmo&s;t Extent of the County, has but a &s;mall Harbour, nor has it any thing of Trade.</P>
<P>But <HI>Minehead,</HI> the &s;afe&s;t Harbour on this Side, is a fine Port: no Ship is &s;o big, but it may come in; and no Weather &s;o bad, but the Ships are &s;afe when they are in; and they told me, that in the great Storm, <HI>Anno</HI> 1703, when the Ships were blown on Shore, wreck'd, and lo&s;t, in every Harbour of the County, they &s;uffer'd little or no Damage in this.</P>
<P>The Trade of this Town lies chiefly with <HI>Ireland,</HI> and this was for many Years the chief Port in the&s;e Parts, where Wool from <HI>Ireland</HI> was allowed to be imported; but that Liberty is &s;ince inlarged to &s;eve|ral other Ports by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>The Town is well built, is full of rich Merchants, and has &s;ome Trade al&s;o to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> They corre&s;pond much with the Merchants of <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> in their foreign Trade. What has greatly contributed to the Improvement of <HI>Minehead,</HI> was an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the 12th and 13th Year of the late King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign, which was continued by an Act of the Tenth of the late Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> For Recovering, Securing, and keeping in Repair, the Harbour of <HI>Minehead.</HI> And now &s;o lately as in the Se&s;&s;ion 1737-8, another Act pa&s;&s;ed for further continuing the Terms and Powers of the Two former Acts, for the bringing to Effect the &s;ame laudable Purpo&s;es, in pur&s;uance of which a new Head has been built, the Beach clear'd, and a great Pro|gre&s;s made in the Piers and de&s;ign'd Works.</P>
<P>From hence the Coa&s;t bears back We&s;t to <HI>Watchet,</HI> a &s;mall Port of late Years, tho' formerly much more con&s;iderable; for it had given Place to <HI>Mine|head,</HI> tho' now it is in a much better Condition than it u&s;ed to be in; and this it owes to Two Acts of Parliament, one pa&s;&s;ed in the Sixth Year of the late Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> for repairing of its Quay and Har|bour,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
and the other in the Tenth. But when the Works de&s;igned were near completed, it was found, that the Quay was built much too low, and not ex|tended to a &s;ufficient Length to pre&s;erve the Town, and the Ships and Ve&s;&s;els riding in the Harbour, from the Violence of the Sea: whereupon another Act pa&s;&s;ed in the Seventh of King <HI>George</HI> I. for continuing the Duties laid by the former Acts, and remedying the Inconveniencies before-mentioned.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me, that the Town of <HI>Minehead</HI> ro&s;e out of the Decay of the Towns of <HI>Porlock</HI> and <HI>Watchet.</HI></P>
<P>On this Coa&s;t are va&s;t Quantities of Rock, or rather Pebbles, which the Sea, at low Water, leaves uncovered, from whence the neighbouring Inhabit|ants fetch them on Shore to a higher Ground, and burn them into Lime for dre&s;&s;ing their Land; but it is more e&s;pecially u&s;eful in Building; for that no Cement what&s;oever is more la&s;ting for <HI>Jets d' Eau</HI> Heads, Piers, and other Ma&s;onry that is to lie un|der Water; in which Po&s;ition it runs up to a Stone as hard as Marble, and is &s;carce to be beaten abroad. The Cliffs are &s;tored with Alaba&s;ter, which, by the Wa&s;h of the Sea, falls down, and is convey'd from hence to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and other Places on this Shore, in great Quantity. Neither &s;hould it be omitted, that the Inhabitants burn great Quantities of Sea|weed to &s;upply the Gla&s;s-makers at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>Walking on the Beach near <HI>Watchet,</HI> I di&s;cover'd among the large Gravel great Numbers of Stones, fluted in Imitation of the Shells of Fi&s;hes of all kinds: many of the flat kind are double, and curi|ou&s;ly tallied one in another, which may, by a vio|lent Stroke, be &s;eparated. How to account for the va&s;t Variety to be found here of this Sport of Na|ture, I know not: &s;ome I have &s;een as broad as a Pewter-di&s;h, and again others no bigger than a Pep|per-corn; but in all of them the Flutings are regu|lar;
<PB N="22" REF="23">
&s;ome like the E&s;callop, in Rays from a Centre, others like the Perriwinkle, in &s;piral Lines: in the&s;e and all other Forms, they lie here in great Plenty.</P>
<P><HI>Quantock</HI> is a high Down in the Neighbourhood; from whence, be&s;ides the two little I&s;lands, called the <HI>Steep-Holmes,</HI> and the <HI>Flat-Holmes,</HI> and an ex|ten&s;ive View of the Chanel, I had a fair and di&s;tinct Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t for many Leagues in Length.</P>
<P>From hence the winding Shore brings us to <HI>Bridg|water.</HI> This is an antient and very con&s;iderable Town and Port; it &s;tands at the Mouth of the Ri|ver <HI>Parrat,</HI> or <HI>Perrot,</HI> which comes from the South, after having received the River <HI>Tone</HI> from the We&s;t, which is made navigable up to within a few Miles of <HI>Taunton,</HI> by a very fine new Chanel, cut at the Expence of the People of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and which, by the Navigation of it, is infinitely advantageous to that Town, and well worth all their Expence, fir&s;t by bringing up Coals, which are brought from <HI>Swanzy</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> by Sea to <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and thence by Barges up this River to <HI>Taunton</HI>; next for bring|ing all heavy Goods and Merchandizes from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> &s;uch as Iron, Lead, Oil, Wine, Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, Grocery, Dye-&s;tuffs, and the like.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Bridgwater</HI> is a populous, trade|ing Town, well-built, and as well inhabited, hav|ing many Families of good Fa&s;hion dwelling in it, be&s;ides Merchants. The famous Admiral <HI>Blake,</HI> who under the Commonwealth &s;o much exalted the Glory of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> maritime Force, was a Native of this Town.</P>
<P>This Town was regularly fortified in the late Civil Wars, and &s;u&s;tained more than one Siege. The Situation of it renders it ea&s;y to be fortified, the River and Haven taking one chief Part of the Circumference. Over the River, they have a very good Bridge of Stone; and the Tide ri&s;es here, at
<PB N="23" REF="24">
High-water, near Six Fathoms, and &s;ometimes flows in with &s;uch Impetuo&s;ity, that it comes Two Fa|thoms deep at a time; and when it does &s;o, un|awares, it often occa&s;ions great Damage to Ships, driving them foul of one another, and frequently over&s;ets them. This &s;udden Rage of the Tide is called the <HI>Boar,</HI> and is frequent in all the Rivers of this Chanel, e&s;pecially in the <HI>Severn</HI>; 'tis al&s;o known in the North, particularly in the <HI>Trent,</HI> and the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> at their Entrance into the <HI>Humber,</HI> at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and in &s;everal other Places.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> be&s;ides a very large Church, a fine Meeting-hou&s;e, built &s;ince the To|leration, in which 'tis remarkable, that they have an advanced Seat for the Mayor and Aldermen, when any of the Magi&s;trates &s;hall be of their Com|munion, as &s;ometimes has happened. Here al&s;o is a College, or private Academy, for the Di&s;&s;enters to breed up their preaching Youth.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bridgwater</HI> is a Road to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which they call the <HI>Lower-way</HI>; the <HI>Upper-way,</HI> which is the more frequented Road, being over <HI>Mendip Hills.</HI> This Lower-way is not always pa&s;&s;able, being &s;ub|ject to Floods, and dangerous Inundations. All this Part of the Country, <HI>viz.</HI> between <HI>Bridgwater</HI> and the Sea, and on Northward upon the Coa&s;t, lies low, and is wholly imployed in feeding of Black Cat|tle, which they bring out of the We&s;t Part of <HI>De|von,</HI> and the neighbouring Borders of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> where the fine&s;t are bred; for as to tho&s;e few bred in the&s;e low Lands, they are very heavy, &s;luggi&s;h, and un|&s;hapely, and the Beef &s;oft and &s;pongy, &s;uch as they &s;eldom or never drive to <HI>London</HI> Markets. Indeed, they breed a great many Colts; but then they too mu&s;t be tran&s;planted very young, into a dry, healthy Soil; for 'tis very difficult to find a Hor&s;e of their own Breed fit for any thing but a Drudge. The Moors, or Mar&s;h-grounds, which are al&s;o imploy'd
<PB N="24" REF="25">
in the &s;ame way, extend them&s;elves up the Rivers <HI>Perrot</HI> and <HI>Ivil,</HI> into the Heart of the Country; of which in its Place.</P>
<P>This low Part, between <HI>Bridgwater</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> &s;uffered exceedingly in that terrible Inundation of the Sea, which was occa&s;ioned by the great Storm, <HI>Anno</HI> 1703; and the Country-people have &s;et up Marks upon their Hou&s;es and Trees, with this Note upon them, <HI>Thus high the Waters came in the great Storm: Thus far the great Tide flowed up in the la&s;t violent Tempe&s;t</HI>; and the like.</P>
<P>In one Place they &s;hewed us where a Ship was driven up upon the Shore, &s;everal hundred Yards from the ordinary High-water Mark, and left upon dry Land.</P>
<P>As the low Part is thus imployed in grazing and feeding Cattle, &s;o all the re&s;t of this large extended Country is imployed in the Woollen Manufacture, and in the be&s;t and mo&s;t profitable Part of it, <HI>viz.</HI>

<P><PB N="25" REF="26">The&s;e fine <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Medley Cloths are the mix'd colour'd Cloths, which all the Per&s;ons of Fa&s;hion in <HI>England</HI> wear.

But I &s;hall add a little more con|cerning this County; and upon my entering into the North-we&s;t and We&s;t Parts of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> where the Centre of this Prodigy of a Trade is, I &s;hall &s;um it all up together, and &s;hew you the Extent of Land which it &s;preads it&s;elf upon, and &s;o give you &s;ome Idea, as well of the va&s;t Numbers of People who are &s;u&s;tained, as of tho&s;e who are inriched by it.</P>

<P><HI>Ivelche&s;ter</HI> is a Borough Town, and, as its Ruins &s;hew, was formerly very large, and incompa&s;s'd with a double Wall, and had Four Churches.

<P><HI>Somerton</HI> is a good Market-town, whence, &s;ome &s;ay, the Country takes its Name.

<P><HI>Milbourn</HI> lies on the Edge of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and is very antient; but has neither Market, nor Fair.</P>
<P><HI>Camalet</HI> is a noted Place, &s;ituated on the highe&s;t Ground in this County, on the Edge of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire:</HI> its vulgar Name is <HI>Cadbury-ca&s;tle,</HI> from the Village of <HI>North-Cadbury,</HI> wherein it &s;tands. Hereabouts ri&s;e the Rivers of <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> which run into the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea We&s;tward, and that in <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> which goes Ea&s;tward, thro' <HI>Sturmin&s;ter,</HI> into the Southern Ocean. It is a noble Fortification of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The Pro&s;pect is woody, and very plea&s;ant; here-and-there lofty and &s;teep Hillocks. <HI>Roman</HI> Coins,
<PB N="27" REF="28">
in great Plenty, have been found here, and in all the Country round. The Entrance is guarded with Six or Seven Ditches. On the North-&s;ide, in the fourth Ditch, is a never failing Spring, called <HI>King</HI> Arthur<HI>'s Well.</HI> Over it they have dug up &s;quare Stones, Door-jambs with Hinges, and &s;ay there are &s;ubterraneous Vaults thereabout. The Church and Tower of <HI>Cadbury</HI> is &s;mall, but neatly built of Stone.</P>
<P>At <HI>Wincaunton,</HI> an Urn was lately found full of <HI>Roman</HI> Money. Half a Peck of the &s;ame Coin was di&s;covered in inclo&s;ing Ground, toward <HI>Beacon-a&s;h,</HI> a little above <HI>Sutton</HI>; as al&s;o <HI>Patera's,</HI> a Knife, and other Antiquities, now in Lord <HI>Winchel&s;ca</HI>'s Cu&s;tody: in particular, at <HI>Long-leat,</HI> in Lord <HI>Weymouth</HI>'s Library, a Piece of Lead weighing 50 Pounds, One Foot Nine Inches long, Two Inches thick, Three and an half broad, found in Lord <HI>Fitzharding</HI>'s Grounds near <HI>Bruton</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> was di&s;covered by digging a Hole to &s;et a Gate-po&s;t in, with a legible In&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Road from hence to <HI>Gla&s;tenbury,</HI> is over Rocks and Heads of Rivers. But that is alleviated by the many natural Curio&s;ities &s;uch Places afford.</P>
<P><HI>Kyneton</HI> Village, for half a Mile together, is na|turally paved with one &s;mooth broad Rock, the whole Length of the Road; &s;o that it looks like Ice.</P>
<P>Cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e</HI> Road at <HI>Lyteford,</HI> you enter a flat moori&s;h Country, full of artificial Cuts and Drains. The A&s;cent to the <HI>Torr,</HI> which overhangs the Town of <HI>Gla&s;tenbury,</HI> is very difficult. Upon a narrow Cre&s;t of the <HI>Torr,</HI> which is much the highe&s;t; the Abbot built a Church to St. <HI>Michael,</HI> of good &s;quare Stone. The Tower is left, tho' ruinous, and is an excellent Sea-mark. It probably co&s;t more to rai&s;e the Stone to this Height, than to erect the Building. Half way up is a Spring: it is
<PB N="28" REF="29">
certainly higher than any Ground within Ten Miles of the Place. In the Times of Super&s;tition this great Mona&s;tery held the fir&s;t Place for Reputa|tion of Sanctity.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants will have it, that King <HI>Arthur</HI> was buried here, and, as a Proof thereof, that his Coffin had been found in this Place; and al&s;o, that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> had been here, and that when he had fixed his Staff in the Ground, which was on <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day,</HI> it immediately took Root, budded, put forth White-thorn Leaves, and the next Day was in full Blo&s;&s;om, white as a Sheet; and that the Plant is pre&s;erved, and blows every <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day,</HI> as at fir&s;t, to this very Time.</P>
<P>I believe the Miracle amounts to no more than this; <HI>viz.</HI> That a kind of White-thorn grows here|about, which, in a mild Winter, puts forth &s;ome Blo&s;&s;om about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI>; and I doubt not, but &s;ome of the &s;ame Kind may be found at other Places, if any Ob&s;ervations were made of it. But this Place is remarkable for many other marvellous Stories, recorded by the Monks, who formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>As to the Burial of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> makes no doubt of it, and gives us from <HI>Giraldus Cambren&s;is</HI> an Account how King <HI>Henry</HI> II. cau&s;ed Search to be made for his Tomb, and before the Workmen had dug Seven Feet deep, they came to a great Stone, having a Cro&s;s of Lead on the In&s;ide of it, and the &s;ub&s;equent Letters or In&s;cription upon it, and in the following rude Character; which the &s;aid <HI>Giraldus Cambren&s;is,</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays, was an Eye-witne&s;s of, as well as of a Coffin of hollow'd Oak, which they found by digging Nine Feet deeper than the In&s;cription, wherein were depo&s;ited the Bones of that great Prince. The In&s;cription is as follows:

<P>But to leave the&s;e more di&s;putable Points for Mat|ters of greater Certainty: it is not doubted but King <HI>Ina</HI> built the Church of <HI>Gla&s;tenbury,</HI> as one of the mo&s;t antient, &s;o the mo&s;t wealthy and magni|ficent, loaded with Revenues by the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and per|haps the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarchs. The Abbot lived in little le&s;s State than the Royal Donors, his Revenue
<PB N="30" REF="31">
amounting to 40,000<HI>l.</HI> annually. He could from the <HI>Torr</HI> &s;ee a va&s;t Track of this rich Land in his own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and Seven Parks well &s;tored with Deer belonging to the Mona&s;tery. 'Tis walled round, and imbattled like a Town, a Mile in Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>When I was la&s;t at <HI>Gla&s;tenbury,</HI> there were mag|nificent Ruins; but, within a few Years, a Pre&s;by|terian Tenant had made more barbarous Havock there, than had been &s;ince the Di&s;&s;olution; for every Week a Pillar, a Buttre&s;s, a Window-jamb, or an Angle of fine hewn Stone, was &s;old to the be&s;t Bidder. And they were actually &s;tripping <HI>St. Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Chapel for that Purpo&s;e, and the &s;quared Stones were laid up by Lots in the Abbot's Kitchen. The re&s;t goes to paving Yards and Stalls for Cattle, or to the Highway. So much Dread indeed have the People here of Founders Cur&s;es, that they are afraid to make u&s;e of the Materials for Dwelling-hou&s;es; and are full of Stories of &s;ad Accidents and Judgments, that have fallen upon &s;uch as have; but venture it for the Highways, for a Town-hou&s;e, and even for Barns and Stables; &s;o that, as one ob&s;erves, where few are &s;o hardy as to apply them to their par|ticular or per&s;onal U&s;e, a publick Building &s;hall be erected, where all come in for their Snack.</P>
<P>The Abbot's Lodging was a fine Stone Building, but could not content the ju&s;t-mentioned Tenant, who pulled it down, and out of it built a new Hou&s;e, ab&s;urdly &s;etting up the Arms and Cognizances of the great <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings and Princes, who were Founders, and of the Abbots, over his own Doors and Windows. Nothing is left intire, but the Kitchen, a judicious Piece of Architecture. But Tradition &s;ays, that this is but a modern Building; for the Story goes, That <HI>Whiting,</HI> the la&s;t Abbot, being dealt with by <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and his Cormorants, for a Surrender, and bravely refu&s;ing to join in the Sacri|lege,
<PB N="31" REF="32">
that Prince proceeded to Menaces, and told him, he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"would burn his Kitchen about his Ears."</Q>
To which he returned An&s;wer,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he would build &s;uch an one as all the Timber in the Fore&s;t &s;hould not burn."</Q>
And accordingly, as 'tis &s;aid, built this in Defiance, which is all of firm Stone, Walls and Roof, having nothing combu&s;tible in it. But what neither Flattery nor Menaces could effect, Tyranny and Murder brought about. For the Abbot was hanged on <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s Tower, ju&s;t now mentioned, on the Top of the high Hill, called <HI>The Torr,</HI> thereby accompli&s;hing a Prophecy, (as the Town&s;men call it; but rather occa&s;ioning a Saying &s;ince &s;pread abroad) <HI>That a</HI> Whiting <HI>&s;hould &s;wim over</HI> Gla&s;tenbury Torr.</P>
<P>The Church was large and magnificent; the Walls of the Choir are &s;tanding, 25 Fathom long, and 12 broad. There is one Jamb at the Ea&s;t-end of the High Altar left.</P>
<P>Hereabout were buried King <HI>Edgar,</HI> and many of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Monarchs, who&s;e noble A&s;hes ought to have protected the Whole.</P>
<P>Two Pillars of the great Middle Tower are left, next the Choir. On the North-&s;ide is <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s Chapel, as they told me; the Roof beat down by Violence, and a mean wooden one in its Place, thatched with Stubble, to make it &s;erve as a Stable. The Manger lies upon the Altar and Nich, where they put the Holy-Water. <HI>St. Edgar</HI>'s Chapel is oppo&s;ite to it; but there is not much left of it be|&s;ide the Foundations. The pre&s;ent Work is 44 Paces long, 36 wide without. The Roof is chiefly wanting. Two little Turrets are at the Corners of the We&s;t-end, and Two more at the Interval of Four Windows from thence, which &s;eem to indicate the Space of Ground the fir&s;t Chapel was built on: the re&s;t between it and the Church was a kind of Antechapel. Underneath was a Vault, now full of
<PB N="32" REF="33">
Water, the Floor of the Chapel being beaten down into it: it was wrought with great Stones.</P>
<P>Here was a capacious Receptacle of the Dead. They have taken up many leaden Coffins, and melted them into Ci&s;terns.</P>
<P>The Roof of the Chapel was finely arched with Ribwork of Stone. The Sides of the Walls are full of &s;mall Pillars of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> Marble, as likewi&s;e the whole Church, which was a mean way of Orna|menting in tho&s;e Times: they are mo&s;tly beaten down. Between them the Walls are painted with Pictures of Saints, as &s;till ea&s;ily &s;een. All the Walls are overgrown with Ivy, which is the only thing here in a flouri&s;hing Condition; every thing el&s;e pre&s;enting a mo&s;t melancholy, tho' venerable A&s;pect. On the South-&s;ide the Cloi&s;ters was the great Hall.</P>
<P>The Town&s;men bought the Stones of the Vaults underneath to build a &s;orry Market-hou&s;e, not di&s;|cerning the Benefit accruing to the Town from the great Concour&s;e of Strangers purpo&s;ely to &s;ee this Abbey, which is now its greate&s;t Trade, as formerly its only Support: for 'tis in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable decaying Condition, as wholly cut off from the large Re|venues &s;pent among them.</P>
<P>There are many other Foundations of the Build|ings left in the great Area; but in the pre&s;ent Hands will &s;oon be rooted up, and the very Foot&s;teps of them effaced, which &s;o many Ages had been erecting.</P>
<P>The Abbot's Hall, I have been told, was curiou&s;ly wain&s;cotted with Oak, and painted with Coats of Arms in every Panel. The Morter of the&s;e Build|ings is very good, and great Rocks of the Roof of the Church lie upon the Ground, chiefly con&s;i&s;ting of Rubble-&s;tone untouched by the fanatical De|&s;troyers, who chiefly work on the hewn Stone of the Out&s;ide, till a whole Wall falls, when under|mined a little.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34">Throughout the Town are the tattered Remains of Doors, Windows, Ba&s;es, Capitals of Pillars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> brought from the Abbey, and put into every poor Cottage.</P>
<P>In the Town are Two Churches; the upper a hand&s;ome Fabrick with a fine Tower of good De|&s;ign, adorned with Figures in Niches. The <HI>George</HI> Inn is an old Stone Building, called <HI>the Abbot's Inn,</HI> where chiefly the Pilgrims were lodged, who came &s;trolling hither, and idling their Time away for Sanctity. A Coat of Arms of the Kings of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;upported by a Lion and a Bull, is over the Gate, with many Cro&s;&s;es. There was a Bed of large Timber, with imbo&s;&s;ed gilt Panels, which &s;eemed to have been the Abbot's.</P>
<P>Four Miles from <HI>Gla&s;tenbury,</HI> lies the little City of <HI>Wells,</HI> where is one of the neate&s;t Cathedrals in <HI>England</HI>; particularly the We&s;t Front of it, which is a complete Draught of Imagery, as well as very antient.</P>
<P>The Clo&s;e, or Part of the City where the Bi&s;hop's Palace is, is very properly called &s;o; for it is walled in, and locked up like a little Fortification, and has a Ditch round it. The dignified Clergy live in the In&s;ide of it, and the Prebendaries and Canons have very agreeable Dwellings. Here are no le&s;s than 27 Prebendaries, and 19 Canons, be&s;ides a Dean, a Chancellor, a Precentor, and Three Archdeacons; a Number which very few Cathedrals in <HI>England</HI> have be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The County is the Dioce&s;e, and contains 388 Pari&s;hes, and the Archdeaconries are of <HI>Wells, Bath,</HI> and <HI>Taunton.</HI></P>
<P>The City lies ju&s;t at the Foot of the Mountains called <HI>Mendip-hills,</HI> and is built on a &s;tony Foun|dation. Its Manufacture is chiefly of Stockens, as has been &s;aid; 'tis well-built, and populous.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">Near this City, and ju&s;t under the Hills, is the famous <HI>Wokey Hole,</HI> the chief Curio&s;ity of which is frequently found in all &s;uch &s;ubterraneous Caverns; that the Water, dropping from the Roof of the Vault, petrifies and hangs in long Pieces like Icicles, as if it would, in Time, turn into a Column to &s;upport the Arch.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is <HI>Sedgmore,</HI> a watry &s;pla&s;hy Place, and infamous for the Defeat of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI></P>
<P>In the low Country, on the other Side <HI>Mendip</HI> Hills, lies <HI>Chedder,</HI> a Village plea&s;antly &s;ituated under the very Ridge of the Mountains: before the Village is a large Green, or Common, on which all the Cows belonging to the Town feed: the Ground is exceeding rich, and as the Inhabitants are Cow-keepers, they take care to maintain the Goodne&s;s of the Soil, by agreeing to lay on large Quantities of Dung for manuring and inriching the Land.</P>
<P>Several Per&s;ons frequently, here mix their Milk together, which often weighs a hundred Weight, &s;ometimes more; and is &s;o excellent, that it is often &s;old from Six-pence to Eight-pence <HI>per</HI> Pound, when the <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;e is &s;old but from Two-pence to Two-pence Half-penny.</P>
<P>Here is a deep frightful Cha&s;m in the Mountain, in the Hollow of which the Road goes toward <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; and out of the &s;ame Hollow &s;prings a little Stream, which is &s;o rapid, that it is &s;aid to drive 12 Mills within a Quarter of a Mile of the Spring; but it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to fetch &s;ome winding Reaches in the Way; otherwi&s;e there would not be room for 12 Mills to &s;tand, and have a &s;ufficient Head of Water to each, within &s;o &s;mall a Space of Ground. The Water of this Spring grows quickly into a River, and runs down into the Mar&s;hes, and joins another little River called <HI>Axe,</HI> about <HI>Axbridge,</HI> and thence into the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Chanel, or <HI>Severn</HI> Sea.</P>

<P>This low flat Country contains Part of the Three Counties, of <HI>Somer&s;et, Wilts,</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>; and that the Extent of it may be the ea&s;ier under&s;tood by tho&s;e who know any thing of the Situation of the Country, it reaches from <HI>Cirence&s;ter</HI> in the North, to <HI>Sherburn</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> South, and from the <HI>Devizes</HI> Ea&s;t, to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> We&s;t, which may take in about 50 Miles in Length where longe&s;t, and 20 in Breadth where narrowe&s;t.</P>
<P>In this Extent of Country, we have the following Market-towns, which are principally imployed in
<PB N="36" REF="37">
the Clothing Trade, that is to &s;ay, in that Part of it, which I am now &s;peaking of, namely, fine Medley, or mixed Cloths, &s;uch as are u&s;ually worn in <HI>England</HI> by the better Sort of People; and al&s;o, exported in great Quantities to <HI>Holland, Hamburgh, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy,</HI> &amp;c. The prin|cipal Clothing Towns in this Part of the Country, are the&s;e,

</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e Towns, as they &s;tand thin, and at con&s;i|derable Di&s;tance from one another, (for, except the Two Towns of <HI>Bradford</HI> and <HI>Trubridge,</HI> the others &s;tand at an unu&s;ual Di&s;tance) are inter&s;per&s;ed with a very great Number of Villages, Hamlets, and &s;cat|tered Hou&s;es, in which, generally &s;peaking, the &s;pinning Work of all this Manufacture is performed by the poor People; the Ma&s;ter Clothiers, who generally live in the greater Towns, &s;ending out the Wool weekly to their Hou&s;es, by their Servants and Hor&s;es, and at the &s;ame time bringing back the Yarn that they have &s;pun and fini&s;hed, which then is fitted for the Loom.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ing and flouri&s;hing Circum&s;tances of this Trade are happily vi&s;ible by the great Concour&s;e of People to, and Increa&s;e of Buildings and Inhabit|ants
<PB N="37" REF="38">
in, the&s;e principal Clothing Towns, where this Trade is carried on, and in the Wealth of the Clo|thiers. The Town of <HI>Frome,</HI> or, as it is written in our Maps, <HI>Frome-Sellwood,</HI> is a Specimen of this, which is &s;o prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed within the&s;e la&s;t 30 or 40 Years, that they have built a new Church, and &s;o many new Streets of Hou&s;es, and the&s;e Hou&s;es are &s;o full of Inhabitants, that <HI>Frome</HI> is now reckoned to have more Inhabitants in it, than the City of <HI>Bath</HI>; and &s;ome &s;ay, than <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI>; and if their Trade continues to increa&s;e in like manner for a few Years more, it is very likely to become one of the greate&s;t and wealthie&s;t inland Towns in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Its Trade is wholly Clothing, and the Cloths they make are, generally &s;peaking, all convey'd to <HI>London:</HI> where <HI>Blackwell-hall</HI> is their Market; and, if we may believe common Fame, there are above 10,000 People in <HI>Frome</HI> now, more than lived in it 30 Years ago; and yet it was a con&s;iderable Town then.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o &s;everal large Meeting-hou&s;es, as well as Churches, as there are, generally, in all the ma|nufacturing trading Towns in <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially in the We&s;tern Counties.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devizes</HI> is, next to <HI>Frome,</HI> a large and im|portant Town, and full of wealthy Clothiers; but it has lately run pretty much into the Drugget-making Trade; a Bu&s;ine&s;s, which has made &s;ome Inva&s;ion upon that of the Broad-cloth, great Quan|tities of Druggets being worn in, as well as exported from <HI>England,</HI> in&s;tead of Broad-cloth; but this is much the &s;ame as to the Trade &s;till; for &s;ince it is all a Woolen Manufacture, and the Druggets may properly be called Cloth, tho' narrow, and of a different Make, &s;o the Makers are all called Clothiers.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Avon,</HI> a noble and large fre&s;h River, branching it&s;elf into many Parts, and receiving almo&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="39">
all the Rivers on that Side of the Hills, waters this whole fruitful Vale; and the Water of this River &s;eems particularly qualified for dying the be&s;t Colours, and for Fulling and Dre&s;&s;ing the Cloth, &s;o that the Clothiers generally plant them&s;elves upon this River, but e&s;pecially the Dyers, as at <HI>Trubridge</HI> and <HI>Brad|ford,</HI> which are the Two mo&s;t eminent Clothing Towns in that Part of the Vale, for the Making fine <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cloths, and for the nice&s;t Mixtures.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Towns, South to <HI>We&s;tbury</HI> and <HI>War|min&s;ter,</HI> the &s;ame Trade continues, and the fine&s;t Medley <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cloths in the whole World are made in this Part. They told me at <HI>Bradford,</HI> that it was no extraordinary thing to have Clothiers thereabout worth from 10,000 to 40,000<HI>l.</HI> a Man; and many of the Gentry in tho&s;e Counties have been originally rai&s;ed from this truly noble Manufacture.</P>
<P>If I may &s;peak here from the Authority of the an|tient Inhabitants of the Place, who have been curious Ob&s;ervers upon this Subject, the Country which I have now de&s;cribed, as principally imployed in, and maintained by this Prodigy of a Trade, contains 2,330,000 Acres of Land, and has in it 788 Pari&s;hes, and 374,000 People. It is true, that this is all Gue&s;s|work; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s my&s;elf very willing to be|lieve, that the Reckoning is far &s;hort of the Account; for this Part is exceeding large and populous.</P>
<P>It may be worth Inquiry, how the Manufacturers in &s;o va&s;t a Con&s;umption of the Wool, as &s;uch a Trade mu&s;t take up, can be &s;upplied with Wool for their Trade; and indeed it would be &s;omething &s;trange, if the An&s;wer were not at hand.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may rea&s;onably conclude, that this Manu|facture was at fir&s;t &s;eated in this County, or, as we may &s;ay, originally planted it&s;elf here, becau&s;e of the infinite Numbers of Sheep, which were always up|on the Downs and Plains of <HI>Dor&s;et, Wilts,</HI> and <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> all adjoining. This, no doubt, induced
<PB N="39" REF="40">
the fir&s;t Planters of the Clothing Manufacture to make Choice of this delightful Vale in the Neigh|bourhood of tho&s;e Plains, which afforded &s;uch im|men&s;e Funds of Wool for the carrying on their Works. Thus the Manufacture of white Cloth was planted in <HI>Stroud-water</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> for the &s;ake of the excellent Water there for the Dying Scarlets, and all Colours that are dyed in Grain, which are better done there, than in any other Place of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome Towns near <HI>London</HI> excepted. Hence therefore we fir&s;t ob&s;erve, they are &s;upplied yearly with the Fleeces of Two or Three Millions of Sheep.</P>
<P N="2">2. But as the Number of Sheep fed on the&s;e Downs is le&s;&s;ened, rather than increa&s;ed, becau&s;e of &s;o many thou&s;and Acres of the Carpet Ground being of late Years converted into Tillage, and &s;owed with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Alteration has made <HI>Warmin&s;ter,</HI> a Market-town on the Edge of <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> the greate&s;t Market for Wheat in <HI>England,</HI> where none of it is bought to &s;end to <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> Wheat; and at the &s;ame time the Manufacture pro|digiou&s;ly increa&s;ing; the Manufacturers applied to other Parts for a Supply, and hence began the Influx of North Country Wool from the Counties of <HI>Northampton, Leice&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> the Centre and Markets of which Trade are about <HI>Tetbury</HI> and <HI>Cirence&s;ter,</HI> where &s;everal hundred Packs are &s;old every Week, to &s;upply this prodigious Con&s;umption.</P>
<P N="3">3. From <HI>London</HI> they have great Quantities of Wool, which is generally called <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Wool, in the Fleece, which is brought up from thence by the Farmers, &s;ince the late &s;evere Acts again&s;t their Selling it within a certain Number of Miles of the Sea; al&s;o Fell-wool for the Combers, bought of the Wool-&s;taplers in <HI>Barnaby-&s;treet,</HI> and &s;ent back by the Carriers which bring up the Cloths to Market.</P>
<P N="4">4. They have al&s;o, &s;ometimes, large Quantities of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wool by the way of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> or of <HI>Minehead</HI> in
<PB N="40" REF="41">
<HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI>; but this is uncertain, and only on extraordinary Occa&s;ions. I omit the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool, as being an Article by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus, as tho&s;e who &s;ee the almo&s;t countle&s;s Num|bers of Sheep on the Downs and Plains, and the great Quantities of Wool brought to the Markets of <HI>Tetbury,</HI> and other Towns, as well as what are &s;ent down from <HI>London</HI> into this &s;ingle Vale, would wonder how it was po&s;&s;ible &s;o much Wool could be con&s;umed, manufactured, and wrought up; &s;o, on the other hand, tho&s;e that &s;ee what Numbers of People are imployed, and what va&s;t Quantities of Goods are made, in this Part of <HI>England,</HI> would wonder how the Nation &s;hould be able to &s;upply them with Wool.</P>
<P>And yet, notwith&s;tanding the whole Country is thus bu&s;y'd in the Broad-cloth Manufacture, I mu&s;t not omit to mention, that here is a very great Application to another Branch or two of Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> The &s;upplying the City of <HI>London</HI> with Provi&s;ions: Tho' it is true, that the general Imployment of the People in all this County, is in the Woollen Manu|facture; yet, as the Spinning is generally the Work of the Women and Children, and the Land is here exceeding rich and fertile, &s;o it cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed, but that here are Farmers in great Numbers, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to cultivate the Land, and &s;up|ply the re&s;t of the Inhabitants with Provi&s;ions; and this they do &s;o well, that notwith&s;tanding the County is exceeding populous, yet Provi&s;ions of all Sorts are cheap, the Quantity very great, and a con&s;iderable Overplus &s;ent every Day to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>All the lower Part of this County, and al&s;o of <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> adjoining, is full of large feeding Farms, which we call Dairies; and the Chee&s;e they make is excellent, and is eaten newer than that from <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> Of this a va&s;t Quantity is every Week &s;ent up to <HI>London,</HI> where, tho' it is called <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="42">
Chee&s;e, yet the greate&s;t Part of it comes from <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI>; the <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;e being more generally carried to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Bath,</HI> where a very great Quantity is con&s;umed, as well by the Inhabit|ants of the&s;e two populous Cities, as in Exportation to our <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Colonies, and other Places; whereas this <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;e is carried to the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> which runs thro' Part of the County, by Land-carriage, and &s;o by Barges to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Again, in the Spring of the Year, they make a va&s;t Quantity of that we call Green or New Chee&s;e, which is a thin and very &s;oft Chee&s;e, re&s;embling Cream Chee&s;es, but &s;omewhat thicker. The&s;e are &s;o univer&s;ally liked in <HI>London,</HI> that all the low rich Lands of this County are hardly enough to &s;upply the Market; but then this holds for little more than the Two fir&s;t Summer Months of the Year.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the Farmers in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and the Part of <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> adjoining, &s;end a very great Quan|tity of Bacon up to <HI>London,</HI> which is e&s;teemed the be&s;t Bacon in <HI>England, Hamp&s;hire</HI> only excepted. This Bacon is rai&s;ed here, by their great Dairies, as the Hogs are fed with the va&s;t Quantities of Whey, and &s;kimmed Milk, which the Farmers mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have thrown away.</P>
<P>But this is not all; for as the North Part of <HI>Wilt|&s;hire,</HI> as well the Downs as the Vales, border upon the River <HI>Thames,</HI> and in &s;ome Places come up even to the Banks of it, &s;o mo&s;t of that Part of the County being arable Land, they &s;ow a very great Quantity of Barley, which is carried to the Markets at <HI>Abingdon,</HI> at <HI>Faringdon,</HI> and &s;uch Places, where it is made into Malt, and carried to <HI>London.</HI> This imploys all the Hill-country from above <HI>Malm&s;bury</HI> to <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and on the Side of the Vale of <HI>White-hor&s;e,</HI> as 'tis called, which is in <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> and the Hills adjoining; a Track of fertile Ground, which furni&s;hes a prodigious Quantity of Barley.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="43">Thus <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> helps to &s;upply <HI>London</HI> with Chee&s;e, Bacon, and Malt, Three very con&s;iderable Articles, be&s;ides that va&s;t Manufacture of fine <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cloths, of which I have &s;aid &s;o much; and I may without Partiality &s;ay, that it is thereby rendered one of the mo&s;t important Counties in <HI>England</HI> to the publick Wealth of the Kingdom. The bare Product is in it&s;elf prodigiou&s;ly great; the Downs are an inex|hau&s;ted Store-hou&s;e of Wool, and of Corn; and the Valley, or low Part of it, is the like for Chee&s;e and Bacon.</P>
<P>One Thing here is worth while to mention, for the Ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e Counties in <HI>England,</HI> where they are not yet arrived to that Perfection in Hu&s;|bandry, as in this County; and I have purpo&s;ely re&s;erved it to this Place; and that is, The Downs or Plains, which tho' generally called <HI>Sali&s;bury Plain,</HI> yet extend them&s;elves into the Counties of <HI>South|ampton, Wilts,</HI> and <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> were formerly wholly taken up with Sheep, as being thought incapable of producing Grain, but now are made to yield mo&s;t plentiful Crops, by folding their Sheep upon the plough'd Lands, removing the Fold every Night to a fre&s;h Place, till the whole Fallow has been folded on. This alone has made the&s;e Lands, which in them|&s;elves are poor, and, in &s;ome Places, &s;o &s;hallow as that the Earth is not &s;ix Inches deep over the &s;olid Chalk, able to bear as good Wheat, as any of the richer Lands in the Vales, tho' not altogether in &s;uch great Quantities: And were it not for this Improve|ment, the Product would hardly compen&s;ate the Ploughman's Labour; for many of the&s;e Lands lie up &s;uch high Hills, &s;o remote from the Farmers Hou&s;es, which are always in the Valleys, that it would be very difficult to carry up their Dung to manure them.</P>
<P>If this way of folding Sheep upon the Fallows and ploughed Lands were practi&s;ed in &s;ome other Parts
<PB N="43" REF="44">
of <HI>Britain,</HI> and e&s;pecially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> it would effectually improve the wa&s;te Lands, which now are u&s;ele&s;s and uncultivated, and turn both Sheep and Lands to a better Account than was ever yet known among them. In <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> it appears to be &s;o, very &s;ignificantly; for if a Farmer has a Thou&s;and Sheep, and no Fallows to fold them on, his Neighbours will give him Ten Shillings a Night for every Thou&s;and.</P>
<P>But as I have not mentioned the&s;e Clothing Towns other than as they contribute to that Trade, I &s;hall now proceed to &s;ay &s;omething of the Towns them|&s;elves, except tho&s;e in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI>; of which I &s;hall &s;peak in my next Letter, as I fall down We&s;tward.</P>
<P><HI>Shipton-Mallet, Ca&s;tle Carey, Wincaunton,</HI> and <HI>Bruton,</HI> lie to the Southward of <HI>Wells,</HI> and have nothing remarkable in them except the la&s;t, which lies on the River <HI>Brews.</HI> It has a fair Church, a good Free-&s;chool, and a &s;tately Alms-hou&s;e, the Ruins of a Priory, and be&s;ide the Clothing-trade, is famous for Stockens.</P>
<P><HI>Frome,</HI> and <HI>Philips Norton,</HI> lie Ea&s;t of <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> upon the Borders of <HI>Wilts.</HI> The fir&s;t is near the Fore&s;t of <HI>Selwood,</HI> and I have already mentioned its prodigious Increa&s;e of late Years. The la&s;t is a very good Market-town, and has Two annual Fairs, one reputed, for a One-day Fair, as great as any in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bensford</HI> is a &s;mall Market-town, and lies North-we&s;t toward <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Malm&s;bury</HI> is a very antient Town, and, 'tis &s;aid, was built by a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Prince, called <HI>Caer Bladdon.</HI> It was formerly defended by Walls, and a large &s;trong Ca&s;tle, which was razed afterward, to inlarge the Abbey, which was very famous, and the greate&s;t in <HI>Wilt&s;hire:</HI> the Abbot &s;at in Parliament. King <HI>Athel&s;tane</HI> was buried here, and they &s;till &s;hew
<PB N="44" REF="45">
his Tomb here. Va&s;t Piles of Buildings were pulled down at the Di&s;&s;olution, but the Church of the Abbey was &s;aved, a great Part of which &s;till remains, and is u&s;ed as the Pari&s;h Church. It is a Corporation governed by a <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> who is an annual Magi&s;trate, and called <HI>The Alderman.</HI> It has a good Market weekly. The Town is neat, and lies on the River <HI>Avon.</HI> It is al&s;o famous for the Birth-place of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malm&s;bury,</HI> the Hi&s;torian; and of that great Scholar, Philo&s;opher, and Mathematician, <HI>Hobbes</HI>; and of divers other very great and re|markable Men.</P>
<P>Near this Town, Southward, on the &s;ame River, lies the Village of <HI>Dant&s;ey,</HI> which, tho' but an ob|&s;cure Place, has given Title of Honour to many eminent Per&s;ons, and among the re&s;t, to <HI>Henry Danvers,</HI> created Baron of this Place by King <HI>James</HI> I. tho' afterwards made Earl of <HI>Danby.</HI> He had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wars, was as good as great, and died with Glory; but his Brother and Heir, having &s;at, ungratefully, a Judge on that very King who made his Brother Earl, was, at the Re&s;toration, attainted of High Trea&s;on; and this his Manor of <HI>Dant&s;ey</HI> given to <HI>James</HI> then Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who &s;ettled it in Dowry on his &s;econd Con&s;ort. On his Abdication, it became a &s;econd time forfeited, and King <HI>William</HI> conferred it on <HI>Charles</HI> Lord <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> late Earl of <HI>Peter|borough</HI> and <HI>Monmouth,</HI> in who&s;e Family it &s;till remains. But as there are &s;ome other Things more than ordinarily particular, relating to this Manor, I &s;hall inlarge a little upon it.</P>
<P>The whole Pari&s;h of <HI>Dant&s;ey</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of this Manor only, and not a Foot of Ground in it be|longs to any other Per&s;on: it is altogether Pa&s;ture, and indeed very rich. The Inhabitants, who are all Tenants of the Manor, make mo&s;t excellent Chee&s;e, not at all inferior to that of <HI>Chedder,</HI> which is the
<PB N="45" REF="46">
only Commodity in the Place; for the late Lord would not permit the Grounds to be ploughed up; and, I believe, there is not an Acre in the Pari&s;h of arable Land, tho' the Tenants have offered a con&s;iderable Advance of Rent, for Liberty to break up the Ground, which indeed &s;eems to want it, and would be much better'd by the Plough; nor would his Lord&s;hip, for &s;ome Years before his Death, renew a Life upon it, either by Lea&s;e or Copyhold, except as many of the la&s;t, as would keep up the Homage, and the Rights of the Manor: and the Rea&s;on of this was, not only to get a clear Rack-rent E&s;tate in it, but to prevent the Cheats and Impo&s;itions which the Copyhold Tenants of the Manor put upon their Lord; for as every Widow has her Life in her Hu&s;band's Copyhold after his Death, if &s;he continues &s;ole and continent, 'tis a very common thing there for an old Man, on his Death-bed, to marry a young Woman, who privately contracts to give Part of the Profits of the Copyhold, or &s;ome Con&s;ideration for it, to the Hu&s;band's Relations, and not &s;eldom &s;elects, for a Bedfellow for her&s;elf, one of her favourite Men-&s;ervants.</P>
<P>The Abu&s;e which accrued from granting Lea&s;es on Lives is this, That whereas a Per&s;on takes a Lea&s;e for Three Lives, <HI>viz.</HI> his own, his Wife's, and his Son <HI>John</HI>'s; to defraud the Lord of the Manor, he names all his Sons <HI>John</HI>; &s;o that, as long as any of the Sons live, <HI>John</HI> in the Lea&s;e never dies.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Frauds, the Earl, who was none of the be&s;t Oeconomi&s;ts, and lived remote from this Place, &s;uffered con&s;iderably, tho' he could not find out how; but frequently complained, That his Le&s;&s;ees, and his Copyhold-Widows, were very long lived; and, in an humorous way, u&s;ed to recommend his Manor of <HI>Dant&s;ey</HI> to all &s;uch as were apprehen&s;ive of dying.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">As all in the Pari&s;h were his Tenants, and had an Intere&s;t in the Fraud, they combined again&s;t him, &s;o that he could get no Intelligence of it: and tho' his Lord&s;hip enjoyed the Manor ever &s;ince the Revo|lution, yet, by rea&s;on of its being then full e&s;tated, that is, all let out upon Lives then actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and continued by the above-mentioned Frauds, his Lord&s;hip received no great Benefit out of it till &s;ome few Years before his Death; when he came to a Re&s;olution not to renew, tho', when all the Lives drop in, this Manor will, at a Rack-rent, amount to at lea&s;t 3000<HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>There is a large old Man&s;ion-hou&s;e here, lying ju&s;t on the River, with Gardens formed after the Manner of tho&s;e at <HI>Par&s;ons-green</HI>; but it is not a kindly Place for ripening Fruit, and the Grounds lie very low and &s;pla&s;hy, being all of a &s;tiff Clay, and yet very good Pa&s;ture. Here is al&s;o a fine Park well timber'd, but without Deer.

<P>Tho' this Place is often overflowed with Water, yet there is none good, either for Brewing or Wa&s;h|ing, or any Spring of &s;weet Water.

<P>The <HI>Devizes</HI> is excellently &s;ituated, about Two Miles from the Bottom of the Hills, which keep off the Ea&s;tern Winds, and in a rich Soil. Under the Hill, at <HI>Runway,</HI> is an excellent Spring, which the Inhabitants have not yet found Means to convey thither, tho' it runs but a little way off the Town, where they want Water. It is a very large old Town, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of Two long parallel Streets, the Hou&s;es mo&s;tly of Tim|ber, but of a very good Model. The Inhabitants value them&s;elves for being Tenants to the King, and for one of the be&s;t weekly Markets in <HI>England.</HI> The Ca&s;tle was originally <HI>Roman,</HI> judiciou&s;ly &s;eated upon a natural Fortification; but in After-times, made in a manner impregnable by <HI>Roger,</HI> a Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> tho' now it &s;uffers daily by Peoples taking away the Materials. Here are Two Churches. The Choir of <HI>St. Mary's</HI> is of a very old Model, as are the Steeple, Choir, and both Wings of <HI>St. John's,</HI> to which Additions have been made; and new wide Windows with pointed

<P>Ju&s;t out of Town is a pretty Plain called <HI>the Green,</HI> with another hand&s;ome Church and Steeple, Suburbs to the old Town.

<P><HI>Calne</HI> is a little Town, &s;ituate on a &s;tony Hill, and very antient, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been one of the Seats of the <HI>We&s;t-Saxon</HI> Kings. It has a neat Church, and a good weekly Market. After a great Rain, in <HI>November</HI> 1725, the Waters ro&s;e &s;o very high here, on a &s;udden, that they overflow'd the Town, damaged a great Quantity of Goods, drowned Two Men in the Street, and carried off a Ca&s;k of Oil of 100 Gallons, which could not be found for &s;everal Days after.

<P>I am now come into the Road to <HI>Marlborough:</HI> On the Downs, about Two or Three Miles from the Town, are abundance of loo&s;e Stones, lying &s;cattered about the Plain, &s;ome whereof are very large, and appear to be of the &s;ame Kind with tho&s;e of <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> and &s;ome larger: they are called by the Country People, the <HI>Grey Weathers</HI>; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that they look not unlike Sheep &s;traggling upon the

Downs, on a tran&s;ient and di&s;tant View, as Travellers pa&s;s. The&s;e <HI>Grey Weathers,</HI> on a more curious In&s;pection, are found to be a Sort of white Marble, and lie upon the Surface of the Ground in infinite Numbers, and of all Dimen&s;ions. They are loo&s;e, detached from any Rock, and, as Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> thinks, lay there ever &s;ince the Creation, being &s;olid Parts thrown out to the Surface of the fluid Globe, when its Rotation was fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Marlborough,</HI> &s;o called from its Hills of Chalk, which antiently was called <HI>Marle.</HI> It is the <HI>Cunetia</HI> (from <HI>Kenet</HI>) of the <HI>Romans</HI>; but from the coming of the <HI>Saxons</HI> to the Conque&s;t, there is no Mention of it. It is governed by a Mayor, Aldermen, and Burge&s;&s;es, and is well-built. It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of One broad and &s;trait Street. To the South are &s;ome Relicks of a Priory; the Gate-hou&s;e is &s;till remain|ing. On the North, the Chapel of another Reli|gious Hou&s;e remains, now turned into a Dwelling-hou&s;e. The Seat of my Lord <HI>Hertford</HI> was the Scite of the <HI>Roman Co&s;trum</HI>; for there they find Foundations, and <HI>Roman</HI> Coins; and towards the River, without the Garden-walls, one Angle of it very manife&s;tly remains; and the Rampart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d Ditch intire. The Road going over the Bridge cuts it off from the pre&s;ent Ca&s;tle. The Ditch is &s;till 20 Feet wide in &s;ome Parts. The Mount, &s;o much noted, was the Keep of the Ca&s;tle; it is now converted into a pretty &s;piral Walk, on the Top of which is an octagonal Summer-hou&s;e, from whence you have a plea&s;ant View over the Town and County. The Town has at pre&s;ent a pretty good Shop-keeping Trade, but not much of the manufacturing Part. The River <HI>Kennet,</HI> &s;ome Years ago made navi|gable by Act of Parliament, ri&s;es ju&s;t by this Town; from whence running to <HI>Hungerford</HI> and <HI>Newbury,</HI> it becomes a large Stream; and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Reading,</HI> runs into the <HI>Thames</HI> near that Town.

<P>At <HI>Abury,</HI> near <HI>Marlborough</HI> Downs, in the Way to <HI>Bath,</HI> are to be &s;een the &s;tupendous Remains of a <HI>Druids</HI> Temple, being a Collection of mon&s;trous Stones of the like Nature with tho&s;e of <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> and brought together from the Downs for the &s;ame re|ligious Purpo&s;es, as Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> makes no Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>On the Hills on this Side the <HI>Devizes</HI> is <HI>Round|way Down,</HI> where the King's Forces, under Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> but owing chiefly to the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> beat and intirely routed the famous Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> in the Civil Wars; from whence the Place is called by &s;ome, <HI>Run-away Down,</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>A little nearer towards <HI>Marlborough</HI> is <HI>St. Ann's Hill,</HI> where, notwith&s;tanding &s;everal high Hills be|tween, and the Di&s;tance of Twenty-two Miles, or more, is a fair View of <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> Steeple, or Spire, which is deem'd the highe&s;t in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Badmington</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> have been found <HI>Nine Caves</HI> all in a Row, but of different Dimen&s;ions, the lea&s;t of them Four Feet wide, &s;ome Nine or Ten Feet long, Two long Stones being &s;et upon the Sides, and the Top cover'd with broad Stones. Spurs, Pieces of Armour, and the like, have been found in the&s;e <HI>Caves</HI>; which gives Ground to believe, that they were Tombs of &s;ome antient Warriors, <HI>Romans, Saxons,</HI> or <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>In our Way from <HI>Marlborough</HI> to <HI>Newbury,</HI> we mounted a chalky Hill, (of which Sort is much of the Soil of <HI>Wilts</HI>) on the Top of which we enter'd into <HI>Savernack</HI> Fore&s;t, belonging to the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ght Hon. the Lord <HI>Bruce,</HI> and is almo&s;t the only privileged Ground of Hunting, of that Denomination, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a Subject.

<PB N="52" REF="53">
and render'd very plea&s;ant and delightful by the many Walks and Vi&s;tas lately cut and levell'd through the &s;everal Coppices and Woods with which it abounds. Eight of the&s;e Vi&s;tas meet like &s;o many Rays of a Star, in a Point near the Middle of the Fore&s;t, where his Lord&s;hip has prepared and cleared the Ground for erecting an Octagon Tower, who&s;e Sides will be corre&s;pondent to the Vi&s;tas, thro' one of which you will have a View of his Lord&s;hip's Seat at about Two Miles Di&s;tance, called <HI>Tottenham,</HI> from a Park of that Name, in which it is &s;ituate, con|tiguous to the Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>It is a &s;tately Edifice, newly erected on the &s;ame Spot of Ground where &s;tood an antient Palace, de|&s;troyed by Fire, of the Marquis of <HI>Hereford,</HI> &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated for his &s;teady Adherence, and power|ful A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to the Royal Cau&s;e, during the whole Cour&s;e of the Civil Wars, from whom his Lord&s;hip is de&s;cended, by his Mother the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Si&s;ter and Niece to the Two la&s;t Dukes of <HI>Somer|&s;et,</HI> of the elder Line.</P>
<P>To give you &s;ome Idea of the Grandeur and Magnificence of the Structure, it will be &s;uffi|cient to ob&s;erve, that it was begun, carried on and fini&s;h'd, after the Model, and under the Direction, of our modern <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> who, to the Strength and Convenience of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Architecture, has added the Elegance and Politene&s;s of the <HI>Italian</HI> Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e has Four Towers, and Four Fronts, each of them diver&s;ly beautified and adorned; to which are now added Four Wings, wherein are Rooms of State, a noble and capacious Room for a Library, containing a judicious and large Collection of &s;everal Thou&s;and Books in all Languages, but e&s;pecially the modern.</P>
<P>The Beauty and Delightfulne&s;s of the Buildings are much augmented by the large Canals, the &s;pa|cious

<P>About the &s;ame Di&s;tance from hence, on the op|po&s;ite Side, are to be &s;een the Remains of a large Hou&s;e, the Seat of Sir <HI>John Seymour,</HI> Father of the unfortunate Protector, call'd <HI>Wolf-Hall,</HI> of which no more is &s;tanding than &s;uffices for a Farm-hou&s;e. Here King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. as, Tradition goes, cele|brated his Nuptials with the Lady <HI>Jane Seymour,</HI> and kept his Wedding-dinner, in a very large Barn, hung with Tape&s;try on the Occa&s;ion; for Confirm|ation of which they &s;hew you, in the Walls thereof, &s;ome Tenter-hooks, with &s;mall Pieces of Tape&s;try fa&s;ten'd to them; and between this Place and <HI>Totten|ham</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">re is a Walk, with old Trees on each Side, &s;till known by the Name of King <HI>Harry</HI>'s Walk.</P>
<P>From hence, continuing our Cour&s;e Ea&s;terly, we came to a Borough-town, called <HI>Great Bedwin,</HI> which Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> takes to be the <HI>Leucomagus</HI> of <HI>Ravennas.</HI> It is an old Corporation, and gave Birth to the fa|mous Dr. <HI>T.

<P>Moving hence towards the North-ea&s;t a little, we cro&s;s'd the much fam'd <HI>Wan&s;dyke,</HI> a Work of prodigious Labour and Expence, and concluded by mo&s;t Writers to be a Boundary of one of the King|doms of the <HI>Heptarchy,</HI> probably that of the <HI>We&s;t Saxons,</HI> before its Inlargement by incroaching on other Kingdoms.

<P>Soon after we mounted a &s;mall Hill, of ea&s;y A&s;cent, on the Summit of which was erected, as Hi&s;torians inform us, a fortified Place, the Re&s;idence of <HI>Ci&s;&s;a,</HI> a Viceroy of one of the <HI>South-Saxon</HI> Kings, from whom it derives its Denomination of <HI>Chi&s;bury,</HI> or <HI>Ci&s;bury,</HI> who al&s;o built <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> for the Re&s;ort of his People, as he did this for the Repo&s;e of him|&s;elf. It &s;eems to have been &s;trongly fortified, being &s;urrounded with a double Ditch or Mote, of con|&s;iderable Depth and Breadth, and full of Water: &s;ince which time there has been a Religious Hou&s;e here, the Chapel of which is &s;till remaining, but converted into a Barn.</P>

<P><PB N="58" REF="59">We pur&s;ued the great Road, and arrived at <HI>New|bury,</HI> &s;ituate in a mo&s;t fruitful Plain, and water'd by the River <HI>Kennet,</HI> which is made navigable up to the Town, which carries on a very great Trade in Malt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with <HI>London.</HI> It is governed by a Mayor, High Steward, Aldermen and Burge&s;&s;es. The Streets are &s;pacious, and the Market-place large, where there is great Store of Corn &s;old; and a Hall for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Corporation &s;tands in it.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a good Charity-&s;chool, very well en|dow'd, and this Place is noted for good Trout and Crayfi&s;h.</P>
<P>Near this Town was a double Scene of Blood; for here were Two ob&s;tinate Battles fought at different Times, between the King's Army and the Parlia|ment's, King <HI>Charles</HI> being pre&s;ent at them both, and both were fought almo&s;t upon the &s;ame Spot of Ground. In the&s;e Two Battles it was ob&s;erved by an experienced Soldier, who &s;erved in the King's Army, that the Generals on both Sides &s;hewed the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Skill in the managing, po&s;ting, bringing up, and drawing off their Troops; and the Men fought with equal Bravery. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e Battles the Succe&s;s was doubtful, and both Sides claim'd the Advantage: in the la&s;t, the King's Army had apparently the wor&s;t of it, and yet the King in a very few Days, with a great Body of Hor&s;e, brought off his Cannon, which he had, in the Clo&s;e of the Battle, thrown into <HI>Dunington</HI> Ca&s;tle, and carried them away to <HI>Oxford,</HI> the Head Quarter of his Army; and this he did in the Sight of the victorious Army, facing them at the &s;ame time with a Body of Six thou&s;and Hor&s;e; they, on the other hand, not thinking fit to draw out to at|tack him. That Retreat, in point of Honour, was equal to a Victory, and gave new Courage, as well as Reputation, to the King's Troops.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">Part of <HI>Newbury</HI> is al&s;o known by the Name of <HI>Spinham-lands.</HI> For it aro&s;e out of the Ruins of an old Town, called <HI>Spine,</HI> the Remains of which now join to <HI>Newbury,</HI> in re&s;pect to which it was called <HI>New Borough,</HI> and for Shortne&s;s <HI>Newbury.</HI> It is noted, among other Things, for Two or Three good Inns, where Travellers are well accommodated.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Newbury</HI> was an antient Clothing Town, tho' now little of that Bu&s;ine&s;s remains to it; but it retains &s;till a manufacturing Genius, and the People are generally imployed in making Shalloon, which, tho' it be u&s;ed only for the Lining and In&s;ides of Mens Cloaths, yet it becomes &s;o generally worn both at home and abroad, that it is increa&s;ed to a Manufacture by it&s;elf, and is more con&s;iderable than any &s;ingle Manufacture of Stuffs in the Nation. This imploys the Town of <HI>Newbury,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Ando|ver,</HI> a Town I have already de&s;cribed, and many others in different Counties of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Here lived the famous <HI>Jack of Newbury,</HI> the greate&s;t Clothier that ever was in <HI>England,</HI> having 100 Looms at work in his own Hou&s;e.

He rebuilt Part of <HI>New|bury</HI> Church, and the whole Tower of it. This is One of the Two Legatee Towns (as they were called) in the Will of the famous Mr. <HI>Kenrick,</HI> who being the Son of a Clothier of <HI>Newbury,</HI> and after|wards a Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> left 4000<HI>l.</HI> to <HI>New|bury,</HI> and 7500<HI>l.</HI> to <HI>Reading,</HI> to encourage the Cloth|ing Trade, and to &s;et the Poor at Work, be&s;ides other Gifts of extraordinary Value to the Poor.</P>

<P><PB N="60" REF="61">What Improvement the Towns of <HI>Newbury</HI> and <HI>Reading</HI> have made of the&s;e great Sums, I did not inquire into.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Newbury</HI> the late Earl of <HI>Craven</HI> built a very &s;tately Pile of Buildings for his own Dwelling, called <HI>Spine</HI>; but as it was never quite fini&s;hed, &s;o I do not under&s;tand, that his Lord&s;hip ever came to live in it, and &s;ome Years ago it was by a &s;udden Fire burnt down to the Ground. It was reported, that that Lord built this magnificent Palace, (for &s;uch it really was) at a Time when he had Hopes of marrying Madame Royale, as &s;he was then called, <HI>viz.</HI> the Queen of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> Si&s;ter to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. who, then a Widow, lived under the Shadow of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coutt; but being fru&s;trated in that View, the Earl went no farther in his Building. But his pre&s;ent Lord&s;hip has lately rebuilt this Hou&s;e, and tho' not in &s;o grand a manner as the former, it is very commodious.</P>
<P>We&s;tward, a little out of our Way, we vi&s;ited the Ruins of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Donnington,</HI> ju&s;t mention'd, which was &s;eated on the Brow of a high Hill, wa&s;hed by the little River <HI>Lambourn,</HI> and had been the Seat of Sir <HI>Geoffrey Chaucer,</HI> Father of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poetry. They &s;hew us a Place here, where, in his Days, as well as many Years &s;ince, even down to the Memo|ry of &s;ome of the Inhabitants now living, flouri&s;hed a great Oak, call'd <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s <HI>Oak,</HI> where they very gravely tell you he u&s;ed to &s;it and compo&s;e his Poems.</P>
<P>We went forward to the Town of <HI>Lambourn,</HI> &s;o called from the River which runs down and falls into the <HI>Kennet,</HI> near <HI>Thatcham.</HI> It is &s;ituate on the South-&s;ide of <HI>White-Hor&s;e-Hill,</HI> and has a Market.

<P>At <HI>Newbury</HI> we quitted the high Road, and being de&s;irous to &s;ee &s;omething of the North of <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> we &s;truck up to <HI>I&s;lip,</HI> which tho' but an incon&s;ider|able little Town, yet has a good weekly Market for Sheep.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed North-ea&s;tward to <HI>Wantage,</HI> a Town of &s;ome Antiquity, pretty good and neat. It is noted for the Birth-place of the renowned King <HI>Alfred,</HI> and is watered by the <HI>Och.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Wantage</HI> we advanced into the fine and fertile Vale of <HI>White-Hor&s;e,</HI> which extends almo&s;t from <HI>Farringdon</HI> to <HI>Abington,</HI> tho' not in a direct Line. Looking South from the Vale, we &s;ee a
<PB N="62" REF="63">
Trench cut on the Side of a high green Hill, in the Shape of a Hor&s;e, and not ill done. The Trench is about a Yard deep, and fill'd almo&s;t up with Chalk; &s;o that at a Di&s;tance you &s;ee the exact Shape of a <HI>White-Hor&s;e,</HI> &s;o large as takes up near an Acre of Ground. From this Figure the Hill is called <HI>White-Hor&s;e-Hill,</HI> and the Vale below takes al&s;o its Name. 'Tis &s;aid to be done in order to commemorate a &s;ignal Victory; and &s;ome give it to the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who&s;e Device was, and &s;till is, a white Hor&s;e. We&s;t|ward of this Vale, lies <HI>A&s;hbury,</HI> betwixt which and <HI>Wantage</HI> is a very large Camp on the Brow of a Hill: 'tis &s;ingle work'd, and of a quadrangular Form, which &s;hews it a <HI>Roman</HI> Work.</P>
<P>The neighbouring Pari&s;h to this <HI>White-Hor&s;e</HI> have a Cu&s;tom annually at <HI>Mid&s;ummer,</HI> to go and weed it, in order to keep it in Shape and Colour; and when they have done their Work, they end the Day in Fea&s;ting and Meriment.</P>
<P>We arrived at <HI>Farringdon,</HI> noted for its plea&s;ant Situation on a Hill. It has a very good Market weekly, and is very neat and clean. In this Place may be &s;een the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle, built by <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> in King <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Reign. Here was al&s;o a Priory of <HI>Ci&s;tertian</HI> Monks. The Church is large and hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>From hence we went partly by the Fore&s;t to <HI>Abingdon,</HI> a hand&s;ome well-built Town, where the A&s;&s;izes and Se&s;&s;ions, and other publick Meet|ings of the County, are generally held. Here is a &s;tately Market-hou&s;e, built on high Pillars, over which is a large Hall for the A&s;&s;izes. The Town con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal well-paved Streets, which centre in an open and &s;pacious Place, where the Corn-market is kept. They make great Quantities of Malt here, and &s;end it up by Barges to <HI>London.</HI> Here is a good Free-School, and al&s;o a Charity-School.
<PB N="63" REF="64">
The Corporation is governed by a Mayor, Two Bailiffs, and Nine Aldermen.</P>
<P>It is an antient Town, and was famed for Reli|gious Hou&s;es in the Time of the antient <HI>Britons.</HI> It was al&s;o famous for having &s;everal Synods held there, and for one of the noble&s;t Abbeys in the King|dom, founded, as it is &s;aid, by <HI>Heane,</HI> Nephew to <HI>Ci&s;&s;a,</HI> Father to King <HI>Ina. Henry</HI> I. was educated in this Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>We next came to <HI>Wallingford,</HI> called by the antient <HI>Britons Gwal Hen,</HI> i. e. <HI>Old Fort,</HI> a Place of great Figure, as well in their Days and of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as of the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> the la&s;t of whom de&s;troyed it in 1006; but it was &s;oon rebuilt, and e&s;teemed a Borough, in the <HI>Confe&s;&s;or</HI>'s Time. It has been defended by a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, which has been long &s;ince demoli&s;h'd. It is &s;till a large well-built Town, has a good Market-place and Town-hall, where the A&s;&s;izes have been &s;ometimes held, and a Quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ion for the Borough always. It has &s;till Two Churches &s;tanding; but one was very much damaged in the Civil Wars, when Two others here were altogether de&s;troyed. It has Two weekly Markets, and is govern'd by a Mayor, Burge&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here we cro&s;s'd the <HI>Thames</HI> into <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> and leaving <HI>Wathington,</HI> a little incon&s;iderable Market-town on the Left, we fell down thro' <HI>Netlebed</HI> (like|wi&s;e a Town of little Note) to <HI>Henley upon Thames,</HI> a very antient Town, the Name being deriv'd from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Hen-lley,</HI> i. e. <HI>Old Place.</HI> It was formerly part of the E&s;tate of the Barons of <HI>Hunger|ford,</HI> mentioned before. It is now a Corporation of great Account, govern'd by a Warden, Burge&s;&s;es, and other Officers. It has a con&s;iderable Corn and Malt-market. The Inhabitants are mo&s;tly Malt&s;ters, Mealmen and Bargemen, who by carrying Corn and Timber to <HI>London,</HI> get a gainful Living, and inrich
<PB N="64" REF="65">
the Neighbourhood. It has a good Free Grammar School, and al&s;o a Charity School, liberally endow'd for teaching, cloathing, and apprenticing &s;everal poor Children. Here is al&s;o an Alms-hou&s;e, but meanly endowed; for tho' there are not above Six or Seven Per&s;ons in it, they have but Six-pence a-piece weekly for their Allowance.</P>
<P>We return'd over a wooden Bridge, into <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI>; and as <HI>Thatcham, Woolhampton</HI> and <HI>Theal,</HI> which lie between <HI>Newbury</HI> and <HI>Reading,</HI> are at pre&s;ent noted only for being great Thoroughfare Towns, and full of Inns, we went no further back than <HI>Reading.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reading</HI> is &s;o called from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Rhedin,</HI> i. e. <HI>Fern,</HI> which formerly grew in great Quantity there. It is a very large and wealthy Town, hand|&s;omly built, the Inhabitants rich, and driving a very great Trade. The Town is &s;ituated on the River <HI>Kennet,</HI> but &s;o near the <HI>Thames,</HI> that the large&s;t Barges which they u&s;e, may come up to the Town Bridge, where they have Wharfs to load and unload them. Their chief Trade is by this Water-naviga|tion to and from <HI>London,</HI> tho' they have nece&s;&s;arily a great Trade into the Country, for the Con&s;umption of the Goods which they bring by their Barges from <HI>London,</HI> and particularly Coals, Salt, Grocery Wares, Tobacco, Oils, and all heavy Goods.</P>
<P>They &s;end from hence to <HI>London</HI> by the&s;e Barges, very great Quantities of Malt and Meal, and the&s;e are the Two principal Articles of their Loadings. Some of tho&s;e Barges are &s;o large, that I was told, they bring a Thou&s;and, or Twelve hundred Quar|ters of Malt at a time, which, according to the ordinary Computation of Tonnage in the Freight of other Ve&s;&s;els, is from a Hundred to an Hundred and Twenty Ton, dead Weight.</P>
<P>They al&s;o &s;end very great Quantities of Timber from <HI>Reading</HI>; for <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI> being a well-wooded
<PB N="65" REF="66">
County, and the River <HI>Thames</HI> a convenient Con|veyance for the Timber, they tran&s;port the large&s;t and faire&s;t of the Timber to <HI>London,</HI> which is generally bought by the Shipwrights in the River for the build|ing Merchant-Ships. The like Trade of Timber is carried on at <HI>Henley</HI> above-mentioned, and at <HI>Maiden-head</HI>; of which in its Place.</P>
<P>A large Manufacture of Sail-Cloth was &s;et up in <HI>Reading</HI> by the late Sir <HI>Owen Buckingham,</HI> Lord-Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and many of the poor People were profitably imployed in it; but Sir <HI>Owen</HI> dying, and his Son being unhappily kill'd in a Duel a little while after, that Manufacture died al&s;o.</P>
<P>Here is however &s;till a Remnant of the Woollen Manufacture, which was once carried on in it to a very con&s;iderable Degree; and this Town, as well as <HI>Newbury,</HI> has injoy'd the above-mentioned Legacies of Mr. <HI>Kenrick,</HI> to &s;et the Poor at Work, and incourage the Clothing Trade; <HI>viz.</HI> 7500<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>'s Continuator &s;ays, there were once 140 Ma&s;ter-Clothiers in this one Town; but now they are almo&s;t all gone. During the Civil Wars in <HI>England</HI> this Town was &s;trongly fortified, and the Remains of the Ba&s;tions and other Works are &s;till to be &s;een.</P>
<P>There are Three Churches built of Flint and &s;quare Stones in the quincunx Fa&s;hion, with tall Tow|ers of the &s;ame. Here are al&s;o Two large Meeting-hou&s;es, be&s;ides that of the Quakers. <HI>Camden</HI> calls it a little City: it is &s;aid to contain about 8000 People, including a little Hamlet at the Bridge over the <HI>Thames.</HI> Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> was born in this Town.</P>
<P>It was formerly noted for a very famous Abbey, and other Religious Foundations. The Abbey &s;tood in a charming Situation, and large Ruins of it are &s;till vi&s;ible, built of Flint: the Walls which remain are about Eight Feet thick, tho' the Stone that
<PB N="66" REF="67">
faced them is gone. What is left is &s;o hard cemented, that the Labour in &s;eparating them would not be an&s;wer'd by their U&s;e. There are many Remnants of arch'd Vaults, a good Height above Ground, whereon &s;tood, as may be pre&s;um'd, the Hall, Lodg|ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Abbey Gate-hou&s;e is yet pretty in|tire.</P>
<P>This was built by King <HI>Henry</HI> I. on an old Abbey, formerly erected by a <HI>Saxon</HI> Lady. That Prince was buried in it, with his Queen; but their Monuments are lo&s;t in the Ruins of the Place, and no-where to be found.</P>
<P>There was a famous old Ca&s;tle, long &s;ince de|moli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Empre&s;s <HI>Maud,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> I. was al&s;o buried here; but her Monument is lo&s;t, as well as the others. It bore this In&s;cription, as we are a&s;&s;ur'd:
<Q><L><HI>Magna ortu, majorque viro, &s;ed maxima partu,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hic jacet</HI> Henrici <HI>filia, &s;pon&s;a, parens.</HI></L></Q> <HI>Thus tran&s;lated:</HI>
<Q><L>Illu&s;trious in De&s;cent, in Marriage more,</L>
<L>But noble&s;t in her Offspring's Royal Pow'r,</L>

<P>The deceas'd Earl <HI>Cadogan,</HI> who was created Baron of <HI>Reading,</HI> by his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>George</HI> I. in 1716, built a fine large Hou&s;e at <HI>Caver&s;ham</HI> near <HI>Reading</HI>; which his Succe&s;&s;or the pre&s;ent Lord <HI>Ca|dogan</HI> thought fit to reduce to a &s;maller and more convenient Size, as le&s;s regarding the outward Glare of Magnificence, than U&s;e and Convenience.</P>
<P>At <HI>Reading,</HI> in the Year 1688, began the univer|&s;al Alarm that &s;pread over the whole Kingdom (al|mo&s;t at the &s;ame time) of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> being coming to cut every body's Throats; which was carried from
<PB N="67" REF="68">
Town to Town by Peoples Fears and Terrors, aggra|vated by the Menaces of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Detachment of Soldiers, who were beat out of <HI>Reading</HI> by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and prevented taking the Quarters they in|tended at <HI>Maidenhead, Colebrook, Stanes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Con&s;ternation of the People all over <HI>England</HI> on this Occa&s;ion; for the terrible Story &s;pread (like the Undulations of the Wa|ter in a Pond, when a flat Stone is ca&s;t upon the Surface) all over the Kingdom, as I have &s;aid, in one Day; for Fear gave Wings to the News: no Po&s;t could carry it as it flew from Town to Town; and &s;till every Me&s;&s;enger had Two Articles with him: 1. Not that &s;uch and &s;uch Towns <HI>were to be</HI> burnt and plundered by them; but that they <HI>were already</HI> burnt: And, 2. that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were at their Heels to do the like there. And the Service this Report did to the Cau&s;e of the Revolution, is hardly to be imagined.</P>
<P><HI>Twyford</HI> is about Five Miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Reading,</HI> and is only noted, like <HI>Theale,</HI> and the other Towns beyond <HI>Reading,</HI> for its Number of Inns, for the Accommodations of Carriers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t beyond <HI>Theale,</HI> is <HI>Inglefield,</HI> where King <HI>Ethet|wolf</HI> routed the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Reading</HI> I went to <HI>Great Marlow</HI> in <HI>Buck|ingham&s;hire,</HI> which, though not in the direct Road, yet lying on the Banks of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> is pro|per enough to be &s;poken of, and is particularly worth Notice for &s;everal Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a Town of very great Imbarkation on the <HI>Thames,</HI> not &s;o much for Manufactures wrought here, (for the Trade of the Town is chiefly in <HI>Bone|lace</HI>) but for Goods brought from the neighbouring Towns; a very great Quantity of Malt and Meal particularly being brought hither from <HI>High Wick|ham,</HI> which is one of the greate&s;t Corn-markets on
<PB N="68" REF="69">
this Side of <HI>England,</HI> and lies on the Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Between <HI>High Wickham</HI> and <HI>Marlow</HI> is a little River called the <HI>Loddon,</HI> on which are a great many Corn-mills, and &s;ome Paper-mills: the fir&s;t of the&s;e grind and dre&s;s the Wheat, and then the Meal is &s;ent to <HI>Marlow,</HI> and put on board the Barges for <HI>London</HI>; and the &s;econd make great Quantities of ordinary Printing-paper.</P>
<P N="3">3. On the <HI>Thames,</HI> ju&s;t by the Side of this Town, tho' on the other Bank, are Three very remarkable Mills, called the <HI>Temple-Mills,</HI> or the <HI>Bra&s;s-Mills,</HI> for making <HI>Bi&s;ham</HI> Abbey <HI>Battery Work,</HI> as they call it, <HI>viz.</HI> Bra&s;s Kettles and Pans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all Sorts. And the&s;e Works were attended with no &s;mall Suc|ce&s;s, 'till in the Year 1720. they made a Bubble of it, and then it ran the Fate of all the Bubbles at that time.</P>
<P N="4">4. Next to the&s;e are Two Mills which are both of an extraordinary Kind, one for making of Thim|bles, a Work which performs to Admiration; and another for pre&s;&s;ing of Oyl from Rape and Flax|&s;eed, both which turn to very good Account to the Proprietors.</P>
<P>Hither is al&s;o brought down a va&s;t Quantity of Beech Wood, which grows in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> more plen|tifully than in any other Part of <HI>England</HI>; and from whence the County it&s;elf derives its Name.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bi&s;ham,</HI> over-again&s;t this Town, was formerly an Abbey, and the Remains of it are &s;till to be &s;een. The E&s;tate belong'd once to the <HI>Knights Templars,</HI> and &s;ince came to the antient Family of <HI>Hobby,</HI> whereof Sir <HI>William Hobby,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Hobby,</HI> are noted in our Hi&s;tories, the latter as having been imploy'd by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in the mo&s;t important foreign Negotiations, as a learned Man, and great Antiquary.

<P>From hence we fell with the <HI>Thames</HI> into <HI>Maiden|head,</HI> and &s;o came into the <HI>London</HI> Road again. It is an antient Corporation under the Government of a High Steward, a Mayor, a Steward, and Ten Aldermen, out of which they annually elect Two Bridgma&s;ters to look after the large Timber-bridge which here cro&s;&s;es the <HI>Thames,</HI> for the Repair of which the Town has Three Trees annually allow'd them out of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Fore&s;t. The Mayor, for the Time being, is Clerk of the Market and Coroner, and he and the Mayor for the preceding Year, and the Steward, are Ju&s;tices of the Peace: they chu&s;e yearly Two Mace-bearers. The Town is a large Thoroughfare, with many good Inns in it, and has a good Market weekly. It lies in Two Pari&s;hes, one Part of it is in <HI>Bray,</HI> famous of old for its con|forming Vicar to all Times, Changes, and Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as you are out of <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> you &s;ee <HI>Cliefden</HI> on your Left, where <HI>George</HI> Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham</HI> began a magnificent and delightful Palace, which the late Earl of <HI>Orkney</HI> afterwards purcha&s;ed of the Family, and fini&s;h'd; and now has the Honour to be the Summer Retreat of his Royal Highne&s;s <HI>Frederick</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">We came to <HI>Slough,</HI> a Village Five Miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t intirely of Inns. They &s;eem to vie with one another, and 'tis wonder|ful how they all &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and e&s;pecially as they are oppo&s;ed by the Two famous new ones of the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Windmill,</HI> a little Way out of <HI>Slough,</HI> which are much more delightfully &s;ituated, and have better Accommodations.</P>
<P>Here we left the Road, and turn'd to the Right, and &s;oon arriv'd at <HI>Eton,</HI> where there is the fine&s;t School for Grammar Learning, that is in <HI>Britain,</HI> or per|haps in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Buildings, except the great School-room, are antient; the Chapel <HI>Gothick</HI>; but all has been re|paired, at a very great Expence, out of the College Stock, within the&s;e few Years, and a noble Library built for the Reception of Books.</P>
<P>In the great Court a fine Statue is erected to the Honour of the Founder, by Dr. <HI>Godolphin,</HI> late Dean of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, and Provo&s;t of this College; and the Library has receiv'd &s;everal con&s;iderable Benefactions, particularly very lately, the fine Col|lection of <HI>Richard Topham,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> formerly Keeper of the Records in the <HI>Tower,</HI> which was pre&s;ented to it, by the late excellent Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Reeves.</HI> And before that a Collection of Books, valu'd at 2000<HI>l.</HI> was left to it by Dr. <HI>Waddington,</HI> late Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Chiche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The Gardens, which extend from the College down almo&s;t to the Bank of the <HI>Thames,</HI> are well planted and kept.</P>
<P>This College was founded by King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. a Prince munificent in his Gifts for the Incourage|ment of Learning. Witne&s;s, be&s;ides this noble Foun|dation, that of <HI>King</HI>'s College in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to which the Scholars of <HI>Eton</HI> are annually removed; and which, had it been perfected as he de&s;igned it, would have been the noble&s;t Building of the Kind in the

World. But his Succe&s;&s;or and Depo&s;er, K. <HI>Ed.</HI> IV. took &s;everal Manors from <HI>Eton</HI> College, and be&s;tow'd them on their Neighbours at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>; and had in|tended to have taken from them &s;till more, had not the celebrated <HI>Jane Shore</HI> &s;olicited in their Behalf.</P>
<P>This College has a &s;ettled Revenue of about 5000<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> and maintains a Provo&s;t, a Vice-provo&s;t, who is al&s;o a Fellow; Six other Fellows, and 70 Scholars on the Foundation, be&s;ides a full Choir for the Chapel, with nece&s;&s;ary Officers and Servants. The School is divided into the upper and lower, and each into Three Cla&s;&s;es; each School has One Ma&s;ter, and each Ma&s;ter Four A&s;&s;i&s;tants or U&s;hers. None are received into the upper School, till they can make <HI>Latin</HI> Ver&s;es, and have a tolerable Knowledge of the <HI>Greek.</HI> In the lower School the Children are re|ceived very young, and are initiated into all School-learning. Be&s;ides the Seventy Scholars upon the Foundation, there are always abundance of Chil|dren, generally &s;peaking, of the be&s;t Families, and of Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, who are boarded in the Hou&s;es of the Town&s;men, and within the College.</P>
<P>The Number of Scholars in&s;tructed here u&s;ed to be from 400 to 500; but has not been, for Seven Years pa&s;t, more than 320.</P>
<P>The Election of Scholars for the Univer&s;ity, out of this School, is made annually on the Fir&s;t <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> in <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> In order to it, Three Per&s;ons are deputed from <HI>King</HI>'s College in <HI>Cambridge, viz.</HI> the Provo&s;t of that College, and One Senior, and One Junior Po&s;er, Fellows of the &s;ame; who being join'd by the Provo&s;t, the Vice-provo&s;t, and the Head Ma&s;ter of <HI>Eton</HI> College, call before them the Scholars of the upper Cla&s;s, and examining them in the &s;everal Parts of their Learning, chu&s;e out Twelve &s;uch as they think be&s;t qualified, and enter them in a Roll or Li&s;t for the Univer&s;ity. The&s;e Youths are not imme|diately removed from the School, but mu&s;t wait till
<PB N="72" REF="73">
Vacancies fall in <HI>King</HI>'s College; and as &s;uch happen, are then taken as they &s;tand in Seniority in the Roll of Election.</P>
<P>When a Scholar from <HI>Eton</HI> comes to <HI>King</HI>'s Col|lege, he is received upon the Foundation, and pur|&s;ues his Studies there for Three Years; after which he claims a Fellow&s;hip, unle&s;s forfeited by Marriage, accepting of Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Preferments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> accord|ing to the Terms of the Statutes.</P>
<P>The Provo&s;t has a noble Hou&s;e and Garden, be&s;ides the U&s;e of the College Gardens at his Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Will you, Sir, excu&s;e me here a few Lines to the Memory of the late excellent Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Reeves,</HI> before-mentioned? This worthy and emi|nent Lawyer had a Seat in this Town, to which he con&s;tantly retired at the Clo&s;e of every Term, while he was at the Bar; for he would never go the Cir|cuit, or attend the Court of Chancery; and actually declined accepting of the high Office of a Judge, while his Lady liv'd, chu&s;ing rather to &s;pend his Vacations in Retirement with his Family, than either Honour or Profit; yet he was pur&s;ued even here with Ca&s;es for his Opinion, as being the greate&s;t Lawyer of his Time; and the&s;e were conveyed to him by his Clerk from his Chambers in the <HI>Temple</HI>; and after he had an&s;wer'd them, he would return them thither again, without &s;eeing the Practi&s;ers who left them.</P>
<P>This Gentleman lay a long time undi&s;tingui&s;h'd in his Profe&s;&s;ion, under an invincible Mode&s;ty; in|&s;omuch that he thought once of quitting the Bar: but a lucky Occa&s;ion happening, whereby he had an Opportunity to &s;hew his great Parts and Learning, he was &s;oon taken Notice of, and retain'd in every Cau&s;e of Moment; but however confined him&s;elf intirely to the Courts of Law, and chiefly to that of the King's Bench. After the Death of his Wife he was prevailed with to a&s;cend the Bench as a
<PB N="73" REF="74">
Judge, in the la&s;t Court, which he accepted, proba|bly to alleviate and divert the Concern he was in for her Death. He was afterwards made Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common-pleas, in which Office he lived but Two Years. His Death was a publick Lo&s;s, and much lamented.</P>
<P>I am now come to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> where I mu&s;t for a while quit the Subject of Trade and Navigation, in order to de&s;cribe the mo&s;t beautiful and mo&s;t plea|&s;antly &s;ituated Ca&s;tle, and Royal Palace, in the whole I&s;le of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William the Conqueror</HI> was the fir&s;t of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchs, who di&s;tingui&s;h'd <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> That Prince, who delighted much in Hunting, finding it a Situa|tion highly proper for that Purpo&s;e, and, as he &s;aid of it, a &s;uitable Place for the Entertainment of Kings, agreed with the Abbot of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> for an Exchange, and &s;o took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He built a Ca&s;tle here, and had &s;everal little Lodges or Hunt|ing-hou&s;es in the Fore&s;t adjoining; and frequently lodg'd, for the Conveniency of his Sport, in a Hou&s;e which the Monks before enjoyed near or in the Town of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>; for the Town is much more ancient than the pre&s;ent Ca&s;tle, and was an emi|nent Pa&s;s upon the <HI>Thames</HI> in the Reign of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings.</P>
<P>After him King <HI>Edward</HI> III. taking an extreme Liking to that Place, re&s;olved to fix his Summer Re&s;idence here; and accordingly laid out him&s;elf the Plan of that magnificent Palace, which, as to outward Form and Building, we now &s;ee there; for whatever has been done as to beautifying, altering, or amending the In&s;ide and Apartments, nothing has been added to the Building it&s;elf, except that noble Terrace, which runs under the North Front, and leads to the Green on the Park, at the Ea&s;t Side or End of it, along which the fine Lodgings, and Royal Apartments, were at fir&s;t built; all the North-part
<PB N="74" REF="75">
being then taken up in Rooms of State, and Halls for publick Balls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Hou&s;e it&s;elf was indeed a Palace, and with|out any Appearance of a Fortification; but when the Building was brought on to the Slope of the Hill on the Town Side, the King added Ditches, Ram|parts, the Round Tower, and &s;everal other Places of Strength; and thence it was called a Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Such a Pride did this great King take in being the Founder of this &s;umptuous Building, that when it was &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that <HI>William of Wickham</HI> had a&s;&s;umed the Honour of it to him&s;elf, it had like to have co&s;t <HI>William</HI> all his Intere&s;t in the King's Favour, which at that time was very great; but the Prelate cleared him&s;elf by di&s;avowing the Charge, urging that all he protended to, was to acknowlege, That the Money and the Reputation he had gained by building that Ca&s;tle for the King, had been the making of him. For it &s;eems he had cau&s;ed the&s;e Words,
<Q>THIS MADE WICKHAM,</Q>
to be cut in Stone in the inner Wall of the little Tower, which from him is, to this Day, call'd <HI>Win|che&s;ter Tower.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William of Wickham,</HI> whom I have before-men|tioned in my Account of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> was, at that time, the Architect of the Court; and &s;o well per|form'd his Part, that in all the Decorations and Or|naments which have been made &s;ince by &s;ucceeding Princes, they have found no Occa&s;ion to add to or dimini&s;h any thing, except it be to alter &s;ome &s;mall Matter at the Entrance to the great Stair-ca&s;e, the Kitchen, and Offices below Stairs, and &s;uch-like; but the great North and Ea&s;t Fronts, the Square of the inner Court, the great Gates at the entering from the Town, with the Round Tower, and the
<PB N="75" REF="76">
Walls annex'd, are all &s;tanding in the very Form in which King <HI>Edward</HI> III. left them.</P>
<P>The only Addition in the In&s;ide, is a fine Eque|&s;trian Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. which &s;tands over the great Well, &s;unk, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, in the fir&s;t Building, for the Supply of the Ca&s;tle with Water, and in which was an Engine for rai&s;ing it, notwith&s;tanding the great Depth, by very little Labour; the Contrivance and Performance of Sir <HI>Samuel Morland,</HI> an excellent Mechanick and Ma|thematician.</P>
<P>On the Out&s;ide, as I have &s;aid, was added the Terrace Walk, by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> where &s;he u&s;ually walked for an Hour every Day before her Dinner, if not hindered by windy Weather, to which &s;he had a peculiar Aver&s;ion; for &s;he loved to walk in a mild, calm Rain, with an Umbrella over her Head.</P>
<P>This is really a magnificent Work; for as it is rai&s;ed on a &s;teep Declivity of the Hill, it was nece&s;|&s;arily cut down a very great Depth, to bring the Foundation to a Flat equal to the Breadth, which was to be formed above. From the Foundation it was rai&s;ed by &s;olid Stone Work of a va&s;t Thickne&s;s, with cro&s;s Walls of Stone, for banding the Front, and preventing any Thru&s;t from the Weight of Earth within.</P>
<P>This noble Walk is covered with fine Gravel, and has Cavities, with Drains, to carry off the Water; &s;o that not a Drop of Rain will re&s;t on the Terrace, but it is dry, hard, and fit to walk on immediately after the greate&s;t Showers. The Breadth of this Walk is very &s;pacious on the North Side; on the Ea&s;t Side it is narrower. Neither <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> nor any of the Royal Palaces in <HI>France, Naples,</HI> or <HI>Rome,</HI> can &s;hew any thing like this. The Grand Seignior's Terrace, in the outer Court of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> next the Sea, is what I think comes the neare&s;t, and yet is
<PB N="76" REF="77">
not equal to it, if I may believe the Account of tho&s;e who have &s;een it.</P>
<P>At the North-ea&s;t Corner of this Terrace, where it turns South, to run on by the Ea&s;t Side of the Ca&s;tle, are Steps, by which you go off upon the Plain of the Park, which is kept &s;mooth as a Carpet, and on the Edge of which the Pro&s;pect of the Ter|race is doubled by a Vi&s;ta, South over the Park, and quite up to the great Park, and towards the Fore&s;t. Here al&s;o is a &s;mall Seat, that will not contain above One, or Two at mo&s;t, with an high Back and Cover for the Head, which being fixed on a Pin of Iron or Bra&s;s, the Per&s;ons who &s;it in it may ea&s;ily turn it from the Wind, however it may blow; and enjoy a complete Calm. This is &s;aid al&s;o to be Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI>'s Invention, to avoid being ruffled with the Wind; and it affords no le&s;s Shelter from the Sun.</P>
<P>From this lofty Terrace the People within have an Egre&s;s to the Park, and to a mo&s;t beautiful Walk, which neither King <HI>Edward</HI> III. nor his Succe&s;&s;ors, for &s;ome Hundreds of Years, knew any thing of, all their Pro&s;pect being from the Windows of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>On that Side of the Building which looks out upon the Terrace, are all the Royal Apartments; tho&s;e of King <HI>Edward</HI> III. which were on the Ea&s;t Side, being now allotted to great Officers of State.</P>
<P>You mount into the Royal Apartments by &s;everal back Stairs; but the publick Way is up a &s;mall A&s;cent to a Flat or Half-pace, where there are two Entries of State by two large Stair-ca&s;es, one on the Left-hand to the Royal Apartments, and the other on the Right, to <HI>St. George's-hall</HI> and the Royal Chapel.</P>
<P>Before the Entrance to the&s;e on either Side, you pa&s;s thro' the Guard-chambers, where you &s;ee the Walls furni&s;hed with Arms, and the King's Yeomen of the Guard keep their Station. The&s;e Rooms
<PB N="77" REF="78">
lead as well to the fine Lodgings, as to <HI>St. George's-hall.</HI></P>
<P>In the Royal Lodgings there have been &s;o many Alterations of Furniture, that there can be no enter|ing upon a particular De&s;cription. In the Chimney-piece of one of the&s;e Apartments, is a Piece of Needle-work exqui&s;itely fine, performed, as they &s;ay, by the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> during the Time of her Con|finement in <HI>Fotheringay-ca&s;tle.</HI> There are &s;everal Family Pictures in the Chimney-pieces, and other Parts of tho&s;e Lodgings, which are very valuable.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rooms look all out North towards the Terrace, and over Part of the fine&s;t and riche&s;t Vale in the World; which along the Cour&s;e of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> with very little Interruption, reaches to, and includes the City of <HI>London</HI> Ea&s;t, and the City of <HI>Oxford</HI> We&s;t; the River, with a beautiful winding Stream gliding gently thro' the Middle of it, and in|riching by its Navigation both the Land and the People on every Side.</P>
<P>It may be proper to &s;ay &s;omething of the Beauties and Ornaments of <HI>St. George's-hall,</HI> tho' nothing can be &s;aid equal to what the Eye may be Witne&s;s to. 'Tis &s;urpri&s;ing, at the fir&s;t Entrance, to &s;ee at the Upper-end the Picture of King <HI>William</HI> on Hor&s;e|back; under him an A&s;cent with Marble Steps, a Balu&s;trade, and a half Pace, which formerly was actually there, with room for a Throne, or Chair of State, for the Sovereign to &s;it on, when on publick Days he thought fit to appear in Ceremony.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t End of the Hall is the Chapel Royal, the neate&s;t and fine&s;t of the Kind in <HI>England:</HI> the carved Work is beyond any that can be &s;een in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>After we had &s;pent &s;ome Hours in viewing all that was curious on this Side, we came down to the Dungeon, or <HI>Round Tower,</HI> which goes up a long, but ea&s;y A&s;cent of Steps, and is very high. Here we
<PB N="78" REF="79">
were obliged to deliver up our Swords, but no-where el&s;e: tho' here is nothing curious. The Governor or Con&s;table's Lodgings are neatly furni&s;hed, but nowi&s;e extraordinary.</P>
<P>From this Tower you &s;ee <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Cathedral at <HI>London</HI> very plainly.</P>
<P>Coming down from hence we entered into the other Court, where is the great Chapel of the Garter, and the Hou&s;e or College for the poor Knights, as they are called.</P>
<P>I might go back here to the Hi&s;tory of the Order of the Garter, the In&s;titution of which by King <HI>Edward</HI> III. had its Original here: but this is done &s;o fully in other Authors, that I &s;hall only mention, That this Order was not founded on the Counte&s;s of <HI>Salisbury</HI>'s Garter, as <HI>Polydere Virgil,</HI> the mo&s;t con|ceited and mo&s;t erroneous Author that ever wrote of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Affairs, ridiculou&s;ly a&s;&s;erts; but on that martial King's own Garter, which he gave as the Signal at the glorious Battle of <HI>Cre&s;&s;i,</HI> as <HI>St. George</HI> was given for the Word of the Day. To comme|morate which, in Honour of his brave and war|like Son, and of tho&s;e Nobles and Gentlemen who &s;hared with him in the Glory of that ever memorable Day, he in&s;tituted this Order. And here I can't forbear ob&s;erving, (tho' intirely out of my way) how fond we have ever been in following Foreigners in mo&s;t Things, even from the Coxcomb in Dre&s;s, up to the Hi&s;torian; as is evident not only from this idle Story of the above-mentioned Author prevailing among u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in particular, and of his Hi&s;tory in general, but likewi&s;e of the Performance of a late Foreign Author, of the Affairs and Tran&s;actions of this Country; whereby the Tran&s;lator, and Under|take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, to u&s;her it out in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> got at lea&s;t 10,000<HI>l.</HI> when it had nothing more, but rather much le&s;s&punc; to recommend it, than any of our own <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tories.</P>

<P>The&s;e, tho' not all Noblemen, were however Men of great Characters and Stations, either in the Army, or in the Civil Admini&s;tration, and &s;uch as the Sovereign did not think it below him to make his Companions.</P>
<P>The lower Court of the Ca&s;tle, although not &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by Lodgings and Rooms of State, is neverthele&s;s particularly glorious for the fine Chapel of the Order, a mo&s;t beautiful and magnificent Work, and which &s;hews the Greatne&s;s not only of the Court in tho&s;e Days, but the Spirit and Genius of the magnanimous Founder. The Chapel is not only fine within, but the Workman&s;hip without is extra|ordinary; nothing &s;o antient is to be &s;een &s;o beauti|ful. <HI>King's-College</HI> Chapel at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> built by <HI>Henry</HI> VI. and <HI>Henry</HI> VII.'s Chapel in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> are fine Buildings; but they are modern, compared to this, which was begun, as by the in&s;cribed Dates upon the Walls appears, in the Year 1337.</P>

<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable, that King <HI>Edward</HI> owns this Chapel was begun by his Ance&s;tors, and &s;ome think it was by King <HI>Edward</HI> I. and that he him&s;elf was baptized in it, and there was a Ca&s;tle built by <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> al&s;o: As to the Chapel, which was then called a Church, or a Convent, King <HI>Edward</HI> III. did not pull down the old Building in|tirely; but he added all the Choir to the fir&s;t Model, and &s;everal other proper Parts for the Purpo&s;es in|tended, as Hou&s;es and hand&s;ome Apartments for the Canons, Dignitaries, and other Per&s;ons belonging to the Church, which are generally &s;ituated on the North Side of the Square, out of Sight, or rather &s;kreened from the common View by the Church it&s;elf; which Dwellings are notwith&s;tanding very good, and well accommodated for the Per&s;ons who are Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them; then the King fini&s;hed it in the Manner we now &s;ee it: As for the old Ca&s;tle, the Building of <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> the King pulled it down to the Foundation, forming a new Building according to the pre&s;ent Plan, and which &s;tood, as above, to the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. without any Alteration.</P>
<P>The E&s;tabli&s;hment for this Chapel was very con|&s;iderable, by the Donation of divers Subjects, before it was &s;et apart to be the Chapel of the Order: the Duke of <HI>Suffolk</HI> in particular, as appears in <HI>Dug|dale</HI>'s <HI>Mona&s;ticon,</HI> gave near 3000 Acres of Land, 19 Manors, 170 Me&s;&s;uages and Tofts, and &s;everal Ad|vow&s;ons of Churches, to it; which, with other Gifts afterwards, made the Revenue above 1000<HI>l.</HI> a Year in tho&s;e Days, which was a prodigious Sum, as Money went at that Time.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. CONTAINING A De&s;cription of the City of <HI>LONDON,</HI> as taking in the City of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> Borough of <HI>Southwark,</HI> and the Build|ings circumjacent.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Am now to de&s;cribe the City of LONDON, and Parts adjacent: a Work infinitely difficult to be perform'd in the narrow Compa&s;s of a Letter, &s;ince we &s;ee it &s;o fully takes up Two large Volumes in <HI>Folio,</HI> which yet, if I may venture to give an Opinion of it, is very imperfectly executed, and has imploy'd &s;ince another very large one in <HI>Folio,</HI> written by Mr. <HI>W. Maitland,</HI> F. R. S. which has much more Merit than the Two Volumes, and contains many Things needful to be known by the Curious, which are in|compatible with the Brevity to which our narrow Limits confine us.</P>
<P>LONDON, as a City only, and as its Walls and Liberties line it out, might indeed be viewed in a &s;maller Compa&s;s, than what we propo&s;e to con&s;ider it in; for when I &s;peak of <HI>London,</HI> in the modern
<PB N="85" REF="86">
Acceptation, I take in all that va&s;t Ma&s;s of Buildings reaching from <HI>Blackwall</HI> in the Ea&s;t, to <HI>Tothill-fields</HI> in the We&s;t; and extended in an unequal Breadth from the Bridge or River in the South, to <HI>I&s;lington</HI> North; and from <HI>Peterborough-hou&s;e</HI> on the <HI>Bank|&s;ide</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> to <HI>Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare</HI>; and all the new Buildings by and beyond <HI>Gro&s;venor</HI> and <HI>Hanover Squares</HI> to the <HI>Brentford</HI> Road one way, to the <HI>Acton</HI> Road another; a Prodigy of Buildings, that nothing in the World does, or ever did, &s;urpa&s;s, except old <HI>Rome</HI> in <HI>Trajan</HI>'s Time, when the Walls of that City were 50 Miles in Compa&s;s, and the Number of Inhabitants 6,800,000 Souls.</P>
<P><HI>London,</HI> as to its Figure, mu&s;t be owned to be very irregular, as it is &s;tretch'd out in Buildings ju&s;t at the Plea&s;ure of every Undertaker of them, and as the Convenience of the People directs, whether for Trade, or otherwi&s;e. This has given it a very confu&s;ed Face, and made it uncompact and unequal, being properly neither long or broad, round or &s;quare; whereas the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> was, in a man|ner, round, with very few Irregularities in its Shape.</P>
<P>One &s;ees <HI>London,</HI> including the Buildings on both Sides the Water, in &s;ome Places Three Miles broad, as from <HI>St. George</HI>'s in <HI>Southwark,</HI> to <HI>Shoreditch</HI> in <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI>; or Two Miles, as from <HI>Peterborough-hou&s;e</HI> to <HI>Montague-hou&s;e</HI>; and in &s;ome Places not half a Mile, as in <HI>Wapping</HI>; and le&s;s in <HI>Rotherhith.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee &s;everal Villages, formerly &s;tanding, as it were, in the Country, and at a great Di&s;tance, now joined to the Streets by continued Buildings, and more making ha&s;te to meet in the like manner; for Example,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Deptford:</HI> This Town was formerly reckoned at lea&s;t Two Miles from <HI>Rotherhith,</HI> and that over the Mar&s;hes too, a Place unlikely ever to be inha|bited; and yet now, by the Increa&s;e of Buildings in that Town it&s;elf, and the many Streets erected at
<PB N="86" REF="87">
<HI>Rotherhith,</HI> and by the Docks and Building-yards on the River-&s;ide, which &s;tand between both, the Town of <HI>Deptford,</HI> and the Streets of <HI>Rotherhith,</HI> are in a manner joined, and the Buildings daily increa&s;ing; &s;o that <HI>Deptford</HI> may be reckoned a Part of the great Ma&s;s, and infinitely full of People al&s;o; and were the Town of <HI>Deptford</HI> now &s;eparated, and rated by it&s;elf, I believe it contains more People, and &s;tands upon more Ground than the City of <HI>Wells.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Town of <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> on the North-&s;ide of the City, is in like manner joined to the Streets of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> excepting one &s;mall Field, and which is in it&s;elf &s;o &s;mall, that there is no Doubt but in a very few Years they will be intirely joined. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid,</P>
<P N="3">3. Of <HI>Mile-end,</HI> on the Ea&s;t End of the Town.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Newington-butts,</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> reaches out her Hand North, and is &s;o joining to <HI>Southwark,</HI> that it cannot now be properly called a Town by it&s;elf, but a kind of Suburb to the Borough; and if, as once was talk'd of, <HI>St. George's-fields</HI> &s;hould be built into Squares and Streets, <HI>Newington, Lambeth,</HI> and the <HI>Borough,</HI> would make but one <HI>Southwark.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> is in a fair way to &s;hake Hands with <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> as <HI>St. Gyles</HI>'s is with <HI>Marybone</HI>; and <HI>Great Ru&s;&s;el-&s;treet</HI> by <HI>Montague-hou&s;e,</HI> with <HI>Totten|ham-court,</HI> is very evident; and yet all the&s;e put together, may &s;till be called <HI>London:</HI> Whither will this City then extend, and where mu&s;t a Circum|vallation Line of it be placed?</P>
<P>I have, as near as I could, cau&s;ed a Mea&s;ure to be taken of this mighty Body; and for the Sati&s;|faction of your Curio&s;ity, I have here given as accurate a De&s;cription of it, as I can do in &s;o narrow a Com|pa&s;s, or without drawing a Plan of the Places.</P>
<P>As I am forced, in many Places, to take in &s;ome unbuilt Ground, &s;o I have, on the other hand, been obliged to leave a great many whole Streets of Build|ings
<PB N="87" REF="88">
out of my Line: &s;o that I have really not &s;tretched my Calculations, to make it &s;eem bigger than it is; nor is there any Occa&s;ion for it.</P>

<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible to reduce all the&s;e Buildings to a compact Situation, 'tis generally thought, that the whole Body &s;o put together, allowing the nece&s;&s;ary Ground, which they now imploy for the &s;everal Trades in the Out-parts, &s;uch as the Building-yards by the River for Shipwrights, Tanners Yards, Dyers, Whit&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would take up 28 Miles in Circum|ference, very compactly built.</P>
<P>The Gue&s;&s;es that are made at the Number of Inhabitants, have been variou&s;ly formed; Mr. <HI>Mait|land</HI> above-mentioned (<HI>Anno</HI> 1739) computes, that within the Walls, and the Bars, as I may &s;ay, it contains 725, 903; but Sir <HI>William Petty,</HI> famous for his Political Arithmetick, &s;uppo&s;ed the City, at his la&s;t Calculation, to contain a Million of People, and this he judges from the Number of Births and Burials; but he mu&s;t take in a greater Compa&s;s than Mr. <HI>Maitland,</HI> to make up this Number; and according to this Rule, as well by what is well known of the
<PB N="94" REF="95">
Increa&s;e of the &s;aid Births and Burials, as of the prodigious Increa&s;e of Buildings, it may be very rea&s;onable to conclude the pre&s;ent Number of In|habitants <HI>within the Circumference I have mentioned in my Line,</HI> to amount to about 1,500,000 Souls.</P>
<P>The Government of this great Ma&s;s of Building, and of &s;uch a va&s;t collected Body of People, tho' it con&s;i&s;ts of various Parts, is perhaps the be&s;t regulated that any City can pretend to; and of late Years it boa&s;ts of &s;everal new Regulations, as to Beggars, Lights, Pavements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which turn out greatly to its Advantage.</P>
<P>The Government of the City of <HI>London</HI> in par|ticular, and ab&s;tractedly con&s;idered, is by the Lord-Mayor, Twenty-four Aldermen, Two Sheriffs, the Recorder, and Common Council; but the Juri&s;|diction of the&s;e is confined to that Part only which they call the City and its Liberties, which are mark'd out, except the <HI>Borough,</HI> by the Walls and the Bars, as they are called.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> have a Right Pre&s;idial in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and hold frequent Courts at <HI>St. Mary-hill</HI> in the <HI>Borough:</HI> they are al&s;o Con&s;ervators of the Bridge, and the Bridge it&s;elf is their particular Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Lord Mayor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is Con&s;ervator of the River <HI>Thames,</HI> from <HI>Stanes</HI> Bridge in <HI>Surrey</HI> and <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> to the River <HI>Medway</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and, as &s;ome in&s;i&s;t, up the <HI>Medway</HI> to <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> Bridge.</P>
<P>The Government of the Out-parts is by Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and by the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> who are likewi&s;e Sheriffs of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI>; and the Govern|ment of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> is by a High-bailiff, con&s;tituted by the Dean and Chapter, to whom the Civil Ad|mini&s;tration is committed, and who pre&s;ides in Elections of Parliament for the City of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and returns the Candidates who are cho&s;en.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="account">
<HEAD>I. <HI>I.</HI> A brief Account of what the City was before the Fire, and how improved when rebuilt, and within a few Years after it.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE the City, and its adjacent Buildings, to &s;tand as de&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Stow,</HI> or by any other Au|thor, who wrote before the Fire of <HI>London</HI>; and the Difference between what it was then, and what it is now, may be ob&s;erved thus:</P>
<P>Before the Fire of <HI>London, Anno</HI> 1666, the Build|ings look'd as if they had been formed to make one general Bonfire, whenever any wicked Incendiaries &s;hould think fit to attempt it; for the Streets were not only narrow, and the Hou&s;es all built with Tim|ber, Lath, and Pla&s;ter; but the Manner of the Building in tho&s;e Days, one Story projecting out beyond another, was &s;uch, that in &s;ome narrow Streets the Hou&s;es almo&s;t touch'd one another at the Top; in&s;omuch that it often happened, that if a Hou&s;e was on Fire, the oppo&s;ite Hou&s;e was in more Danger, according as the Wind &s;tood, than the Hou&s;es adjoin|ing on either Side.</P>
<P>And tho' by the new Buildings after the Fire much Ground was given up to inlarge the Streets, yet it is to be ob&s;erved, that the old Hou&s;es &s;tood generally upon more Ground, were much larger upon the Flat,
<PB N="97" REF="98">
and in many Places Gardens and large Yards about them, &s;o that there are many more Hou&s;es built than &s;tood before on the &s;ame Ground. For Example:</P>
<P><HI>Swithen</HI>'s <HI>Alleys</HI> by the <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> were all, before the Fire, taken up with one &s;ingle Merchant's Hou&s;e, Mr. <HI>Swithen</HI> by Name; whereas, upon the &s;ame Ground where the Hou&s;e &s;tood, &s;tand now about 22 or 24 Hou&s;es, which belong to his Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><HI>Copt-hall Court</HI> in <HI>Throgmorton-&s;treet</HI> was al&s;o, before the Fire, a &s;ingle Hou&s;e, inhabited by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant: likewi&s;e Three more Courts in the &s;ame Streets were &s;ingle Hou&s;es, Two on the &s;ame Side of the Way, and one on the other.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Alleys behind <HI>St. Chri&s;topher</HI>'s Church, now vulgarly called <HI>St. Chri&s;topher's Church-yard,</HI> were likewi&s;e, before the Fire, one great Hou&s;e, with Ware-hou&s;es, in which Mr. <HI>Kendrick</HI> lived; whom I have mentioned in my Account of <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Newbury,</HI> and took up almo&s;t all the Ground, on which now a Street of Hou&s;es is erected, called <HI>Prince's-&s;treet,</HI> going thro' into <HI>Loth|bury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>King's-Arms Yard</HI> in <HI>Coleman-&s;treet,</HI> now built into fine large Hou&s;es, and inhabited by eminent Merchants, was, before the Fire, a Stable-yard for Hor&s;es, and an Inn, which gave the Sign of the <HI>King's Arms.</HI></P>
<P>I might give many more In&s;tances; but the&s;e will account for what &s;ome a&s;&s;ert; <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;o many great Hou&s;es were converted into Streets, Courts, Alleys and Buildings, that near 4000 Hou&s;es &s;tand on the Ground which the Fire left de&s;olate, more than &s;tood on the &s;ame Ground before.</P>
<P>Another Increa&s;e of Buildings in the City, is to be taken from the Inhabitants in the unburnt Parts following the &s;ame Example, of pulling down great old Buildings, which took up large Tracks of Ground in &s;ome of the well inhabited Places, and building
<PB N="98" REF="99">
on the &s;ame Ground not only &s;everal Hou&s;es, but even whole Streets of Hou&s;es, which are &s;ince fully inhabited: For Example,</P>
<P><HI>Crosby-&s;quare,</HI> within <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate,</HI> formerly the Hou&s;e of Sir <HI>James Langham,</HI> Merchant.</P>
<P><HI>Devon&s;hire-Square</HI> and <HI>Street,</HI> with &s;everal back Streets, and Pa&s;&s;ages into <HI>Petticoat-lane</HI> one Way, and <HI>Hound&s;ditch</HI> another, all built on the Ground where the old Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> had an Hou&s;e and Garden.</P>
<P><HI>Bridgwater-&s;quare,</HI> and &s;everal Streets adjoining, built on the Ground where the Earl of <HI>Bridgwater</HI> had a large Hou&s;e and Garden in <HI>Barbican.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Billeter-&s;quare,</HI> and &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages adjoining, built upon the Grounds of one great Hou&s;e, in which one Merchant only lived.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e Palaces of the Nobility, formerly make|ing a mo&s;t beautiful Range of Buildings fronting the <HI>Strand,</HI> with their Gardens reaching to the <HI>Thames,</HI> where they had their particular Water-gates and Stairs, have had the &s;ame Fate, &s;uch as <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Arun|del, Norfolk, Sali&s;bury, Worce&s;ter, Exeter, Hunger|ford,</HI> and <HI>York</HI> Hou&s;es; the Lord <HI>Brook</HI>'s Hou&s;e in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> in the Place of which are now &s;o many noble Streets and Hou&s;es erected, as are in them&s;elves equal to a large City; all which extend from the <HI>Temple</HI> to <HI>Northumberland-hou&s;e, Somer&s;et-hou&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Savoy</HI> only intervening; and the latter of the&s;e may be &s;aid to be, not an Hou&s;e, but a little Town, being &s;epa|rated into innumerable Tenements and Apartments.</P>
<P>The&s;e are prodigious Inlargements to the City, even upon that which I call inhabited Ground, and where infinite Numbers of People now live, more than lived upon the &s;ame Spot of Ground before.</P>
<P>Suoh was the State of <HI>London</HI> before the Fire in 1666, and &s;o prodigious were the Improvements made in it, within the Cour&s;e of a few Years after that Di&s;a&s;ter. But what are the&s;e, compared to what has been done &s;ince within our own Memory? And this brings me to my &s;econd Article,</P>

<PB N="99" REF="100">
<HEAD>II. Of the prodigious Increa&s;e of Buildings within our own Memory, down to the Year 1740.</HEAD>
<P>NOT to enter on a particular De&s;cription of the Buildings, I &s;hall only take notice of the Places where &s;uch Inlargements are made: As,</P>
<P N="1">1. All tho&s;e numberle&s;s Ranges of Building, called <HI>Spital-fields,</HI> reaching from <HI>Spital-yard</HI> at <HI>Northern Fallgate,</HI> and from <HI>Artillery-lane</HI> in <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet,</HI> with all the new Streets, beginning at <HI>Hoxton</HI> and the Back of <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Church North, and reaching to <HI>Brick-lane,</HI> and to the End of <HI>Hare-&s;treet,</HI> on the Way to <HI>Bethnal-green</HI> Ea&s;t; then &s;loping away quite to <HI>Whitechapel</HI> Road South-ea&s;t, containing, as &s;ome People &s;ay, above 320 Acres of Ground, which are now clo&s;e built, and inhabited with an infinite Number of People.</P>
<P>The Lanes were deep, dirty and unfrequented; that Part now called <HI>Spitalfields-market</HI> was a Field of Gra&s;s, with Cows feeding on it, &s;ince the Year 1670. The <HI>Old Artillery-ground</HI> (where the Parliament li&s;ted their fir&s;t Soldiers again&s;t the King) took up all tho&s;e long Streets leading out of <HI>Artillery-lane</HI> to <HI>Spital-yard Back gate,</HI> and &s;o on to the End of <HI>Wheeler-&s;treet. Brick-lane,</HI> which is now a long well-paved Street, was a deep dirty Road, frequented chiefly by Carts fetching Bricks that way into <HI>Whitechapel</HI> from Brick-kilns in tho&s;e Fields, whence it had its Name.</P>
<P N="2">2. On the more Ea&s;tern Part the &s;ame Increa&s;e goes on in Proportion; namely, all <HI>Goodman's-fields,</HI> and the many Streets between <HI>Whitechapel</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;e|mary-lane,</HI> all built &s;ince the Year 1678. <HI>Well-clo&s;e,</HI> now called <HI>Marine &s;quare,</HI> all the hither or We&s;t End of <HI>Ratcliff-highway,</HI> from the Corner of <HI>Gravel-lane</HI> to the Ea&s;t End of <HI>Ea&s;t Smithfield,</HI> was a Road over the Fields; likewi&s;e tho&s;e Buildings now called
<PB N="100" REF="101">
<HI>Virginia-&s;treet,</HI> and all the Streets on the Side of <HI>Ratcliff-highway</HI> to <HI>Gravel-lane</HI> above-named, which of late Years extends &s;o far, that the End of <HI>Lime-hou&s;e</HI> &s;tands a Chance to be &s;oon joined to the Be|ginning of <HI>Poplar.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To come to the North Side of the Town, and beginning at <HI>Shoreditch</HI> We&s;t, and <HI>Hoxton &s;quare,</HI> and <HI>Charles-&s;quare</HI> adjoining, tho&s;e were all open Fields, from <HI>Agnes St. Clare,</HI> to <HI>Hoxton</HI> Town, till the Year 1689, or thereabout. <HI>Pitfield-&s;treet</HI> was a Bank, parting two Pa&s;ture-grounds, and <HI>Ask</HI>'s Ho&s;pital was another open Field. Farther We&s;t the like Addition of Buildings begins at the Foot-way by the <HI>Pe&s;t-hou&s;e,</HI> and includes the <HI>French</HI> Ho&s;pital, <HI>Old-&s;treet</HI> Two Squares, and &s;everal Streets, extend|ing from <HI>Brick-lane</HI> to <HI>Mount-mill</HI> and the Road to <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> and from that Road, &s;till We&s;t, to <HI>Wood's-clo&s;e,</HI> and to <HI>St. John's</HI> and <HI>Clerkenwell,</HI> all which Streets and Squares are built &s;ince the Years 1688 and 1689, and were before that, and &s;ome for a long Time after, open Fields or Gardens, and never built on till after that Time; and moreover, within the&s;e few Years, all tho&s;e open Grounds, called <HI>Bunhill-fields,</HI> adjoining to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> Burying-ground, are now built upon, and are complete Streets of Hou&s;es to the very Road, and generally well inhabited.</P>
<P>From hence we go on &s;till We&s;t, and beginning at <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> and going on to tho&s;e formerly called <HI>Red-lion</HI> Fields, and <HI>Lamb's-conduit</HI> Fields, we &s;ee there prodigious Piles of Buildings; they begin at <HI>Gray's-Inn-Wall</HI> towards <HI>Red-lion-&s;treet,</HI> from whence, in a &s;trait Line, they go quite to <HI>Lamb's-conduit</HI> Fields North, including a great Range of Buildings reaching to <HI>Bedford-row</HI> and the <HI>Cockpit</HI> Ea&s;t, and including <HI>Red-lion-&s;quare, Ormond-&s;treet, Great</HI> and <HI>Little Marlborough-&s;treets, Queen's-&s;quare,</HI> and all the Streets between the Square and <HI>King's-gate</HI> in <HI>Holbourn.</HI> The&s;e Piles are very great, and the
<PB N="101" REF="102">

<P>Farther We&s;t in the &s;ame Line is <HI>Southampton</HI> great Square, called <HI>Bloomsbury,</HI> with <HI>King&s;treet</HI> on the Ea&s;t Side of it, and all the numberle&s;s Streets We&s;t of the Square to the Market-place, and thro' Great <HI>Ru&s;&s;el-&s;treet</HI> by <HI>Montagu-hou&s;e</HI> quite into the <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> Road; all which Buildings, except <HI>Southampton-hou&s;e,</HI> and &s;ome of the Square, have been formed from the open Fields &s;ince the Time above-mentioned, and contain &s;everal Thou&s;ands of Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Increa&s;e of the Buildings in <HI>St. Gyles's</HI> and <HI>St. Martin's in the Fields,</HI> is really a kind of Prodigy; compri&s;ing all the Buildings North of <HI>Long-acre,</HI> up to the <HI>Seven Dials</HI>; all the Streets from <HI>Leice&s;ter|fields</HI> and <HI>St. Martin's-lane,</HI> both North and We&s;t, to the <HI>Hay-market</HI> and <HI>Scho,</HI> and from the <HI>Hay-market</HI> to <HI>St. James's-&s;treet</HI> inclu&s;ive, and to the Park-wall; then all the Buildings on the North Side of the Street, called <HI>Picadilly,</HI> and the Road to <HI>Knights-bridge,</HI> and between that and the South Side of <HI>Tyburn</HI> Road, including <HI>Soho-&s;quare, Golden-&s;quare, Hanover-&s;quare</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Two <HI>Bond-&s;treets, George's-&s;treet,</HI> and that new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> out to <HI>Tyburn</HI> Road, called <HI>Gro&s;|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;quare,</HI> and <HI>Cavendi&s;h-&s;quare,</HI> and all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> them.

<P>This la&s;t Addition is by Calculation more in Bulk than the Cities of <HI>Bri&s;tol, Exeter</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> if they were all put together; all which Places were, a few Years ago, mere Fields of Gra&s;s, and imployed only to feed Cattle.</P>
<P>In <HI>Spring-gardens,</HI> near <HI>Charing-cro&s;s,</HI> are lately erected &s;everal very hand&s;ome new Buildings, and a neat Chapel.</P>
<P>The new Buildings in the End of <HI>Broad-&s;treet,</HI> near <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate,</HI> formerly called <HI>Petty-France,</HI> de|&s;erve

to be mentioned here.

<HEAD>III. Of the Publick Offices, and City Corporations.</HEAD>
<P>THE EXCISE-OFFICE is kept in the <HI>Old Jewry,</HI> in a very large Hou&s;e, formerly the Dwelling of Sir <HI>John Frederick,</HI> and afterwards of Sir <HI>John Hern,</HI> very con&s;iderable Merchants. In this one Office is managed an immen&s;e Weight of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and they have in Pay &s;everal Thou&s;ands of Officers. The whole Kingdom is divided by them into pro|per Di&s;tricts, and to every Di&s;trict a Collector, a Supervi&s;or, and a certain Number of Gaugers, called, by the Vulgar, <HI>Exci&s;e-men.</HI></P>
<P>Under the Management of this Office are now brought not only the Exci&s;e upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, as formerly, but al&s;o the Duties on Malt and Candles, Hops, Soap, and Leather, Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate; all which we managed in &s;eve|ral Cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Act lately pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t retailing &s;pirituous Liquors in le&s;s Quantities than Two Gallons, which had become &s;o pernicious a Trade, that the lower Cla&s;s of People was almo&s;t wholly debauched and
<PB N="103" REF="104">
enervated by it, has very much increa&s;ed the Con|&s;equence, as well as the Bu&s;ine&s;s, of this Office; for the Commi&s;&s;ioners for what relates to this Matter, are a kind of ab&s;olute Judges in the Ca&s;es brought before them.</P>
<P>The POST-OFFICE is kept in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet</HI> in a large Hou&s;e, formerly Sir <HI>Robert Viner</HI>'s, and is under an admirable Management. The <HI>Peny-po&s;t</HI> is a Branch of it, and a mo&s;t u&s;eful Addition to Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s; for by it Letters are delivered at the remote&s;t Corners of the Town, almo&s;t as &s;oon as they could be fent by a Me&s;&s;enger, and that from Four, Five, Six, to Eight times a Day, according as the Di&s;tance of the Place makes it practicable; in&s;omuch that you may &s;end a Letter from <HI>Limehou&s;e</HI> in the Ea&s;t, to the farthe&s;t Part of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> for a Peny, &s;everal times in the &s;ame Day; and to the neighbouring Villages, as <HI>Ken&s;ington, Hamer&s;mith, Chi&s;wick,</HI> &amp;c. We&s;tward; <HI>Newington, I&s;lington, Kenti&s;h-town, Hamp&s;tead, Holloway, High|gate,</HI> &amp;c. Northward; to <HI>Newington-butts, Camber|well,</HI> &amp;c. Southward; and <HI>Stepney, Poplar, Bow, Strat|ford, Deptford, Greenwich,</HI> &amp;c. Ea&s;tward, once a Day.</P>
<P>Nor are you tied up to a &s;ingle Piece of Paper, as in the <HI>General Po&s;t-office</HI>; but any Packet under a Pound-weight goes at the &s;ame Price.</P>
<P>The CUSTOM-HOUSE comes next to be men|tioned. The <HI>Long Room</HI> is like an <HI>Exchange</HI> every Morning, and the Croud of People who appear there, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s they do, is not to be explained by Words. The whole Building is very convenient, but not like what it might or ought to have been; and moreover, the Quays thereabouts are &s;o throng'd and crouded, that they are much too little for the Bu&s;ine&s;s continually carrying on there.</P>
<P>Between the Hor&s;e-guards at <HI>Whitehall</HI> and <HI>Cha|ring-cro&s;s,</HI> at an huge Expence, but with very little Ta&s;te, is &s;een the new-erected ADMIRALTY-OFFICE. This Office is, perhaps, of the mo&s;t Importance of
<PB N="104" REF="105">
any of the publick Parts of the Admini&s;tration; the Royal Navy being the Sinews of our Strength.</P>
<P>The NAVY-OFFICE, a neat and convenient Building in <HI>Cruched-fryars,</HI> and the VICTUALLING-OFFICE on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> near <HI>Ea&s;t Smithfield,</HI> both which, had we room, de&s;erve a particular De&s;cription, are but Branches of this Admini&s;tration, and receive their Orders from hence; as do likewi&s;e the Docks and Yards theirs from the <HI>Navy-office:</HI> the Whole being carried on with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Order and Di&s;patch. The <HI>Admiralty</HI> has been in Commi&s;&s;ion ever &s;ince the Death of Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark.</HI> The Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;o often change by Deaths or Removals, that it will be of very little U&s;e to in&s;ert them in a Work like this.</P>
<P>Tho' his MAJESTY re&s;ides all the Winter at <HI>St. James</HI>'s, yet the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Government is chiefly carried on at the <HI>Cockpit, Whitehall.</HI> Near which is lately fini&s;hed a magnificent Building, with a very grand Front looking to the Parade in <HI>St. James</HI>'s-<HI>park,</HI> for the TREASURY-OFFICE; and, it being a lofty Structure, over that is the OFFICE of the SECRETARIES OF STATE.</P>
<P>The OFFICE for the BOARD OF TRADE is held ju&s;t by the Upper-end of the <HI>Privy-garden,</HI> adjoining to an old Gate at the Entrance of <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> which is now demoli&s;h'd. It is a large Hou&s;e, and convenient for the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>At the Hor&s;e-guards is a Building commodious enough, built as a Barrack for a large Detachment of the Hor&s;e-guards, who keep Po&s;t here; over it are Offices belonging to the Judge-advocate for holding Councils of War for Trial of De&s;erters and others, according to the Articles of War.</P>
<P>A new Office and Hou&s;e is very lately erected, adjoining to the Hor&s;e-guards, for the Payma&s;ter-general of the Army.</P>

It is a noble Structure; but I have not room for a particular De&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>The EAST INDIA HOUSE, &s;ituated where for|merly was that of Sir <HI>William Craven,</HI> was rebuilt in the Year 1726. It is very convenient within; but without makes not the Appearance that is worthy of the Company's Trade and Figure in the World, its Front being not extended enough. In the back Part towards <HI>Lime-&s;treet,</HI> they have al&s;o Warehou&s;es, which were rebuilt in a very hand&s;ome manner, <HI>Anno</HI> 1725.</P>
<P>The AFRICAN COMPANY'S HOUSE is in the &s;ame Street; a convenient Hou&s;e, which &s;erves for all the Offices their Bu&s;ine&s;s requires.</P>
<P>The SOUTH-SEA HOUSE is &s;ituate in a large Spot of Ground between <HI>Broad-&s;treet</HI> and <HI>Threadneedle-&s;treet.</HI> At fir&s;t two large Hou&s;es were taken in to form the whole Office; but, as they were &s;treighten'd for Room, and were obliged to &s;ummon their General Courts at <HI>Merchant Taylors-hall,</HI> hard by; &s;o they have lately erected a new Building for the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s, which my Limits will not permit me par|ticularly to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The YORK-BUILDINGS COMPANY has been &s;truggling for &s;ome Years pa&s;t with the great Diffi|culties into which it has been plunged by the Fatality attending &s;ome late Tran&s;actions, and I &s;hall &s;ay no more of it here.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o &s;everal great Offices for Societies of INSURERS, where almo&s;t all Hazards may be in&s;ured. The Four principal are called, 1. <HI>The Royal Exchange In&s;urance,</HI> kept in a Part of the <HI>Royal Exchange.</HI> 2. <HI>The Royal In&s;urance,</HI> kept in <HI>Cornhill.</HI> 3. <HI>The</HI>

<P>In the Two fir&s;t, all Hazards by Sea of Ships and Goods, not Lives, are in&s;ured; as al&s;o Hou&s;es and Goods are in&s;ured from Fire.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Two, only Hou&s;es and Goods.</P>
<P>In all which Offices the <HI>Premio</HI> is &s;o &s;mall, and the Recovery, in ca&s;e of Lo&s;s, &s;o ea&s;y and certain, that nothing can be &s;hewn like it in the World.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o Offices of INSURANCE ON LIVES, the <HI>Union Fire-office</HI> in <HI>Gutter-lane,</HI> the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Fire-office,</HI> and others, which manage a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s in the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>The CHARITABLE CORPORATION OFFICE is in <HI>Spring-garden.</HI> A Society that &s;et out with laud|able Preten&s;ions; but many Hundreds of People have found to their Co&s;t, that the be&s;t Pretences are often made a Cloak for the wor&s;t Practices. <HI>Fair and Softly</HI> is now the Word with them: and 'tis fit a profound Stilne&s;s &s;hould &s;ucceed the boi&s;terous Storm they occa&s;ioned, in which the Fortunes of Multitudes of innocent Subjects &s;uffered a Wreck, which they will never recover.</P>

<P N="1">1.

It is 202 Feet high, and exceeds all the Obeli&s;ks and Pillars of the Antients. There is a Stair-ca&s;e in the Middle,
<PB N="107" REF="108">
to a&s;cend to the Balcony, which is about 30 Feet &s;hort of the Top, and whence there are other Steps made even to look out at the Top of all, which is fa&s;hioned like an Urn, with a Flame i&s;&s;uing from it.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayors of this famous Metropolis have been hitherto forced to content them&s;elves with re|&s;iding in &s;ome one or other of the &s;tately Halls of the City Companies, hired for that Purpo&s;e; an In|convenience which was equally unworthy of the Grandeur of the great Officer, and of the City over which he pre&s;ided, and which now will be &s;oon remedied; for on the 25th Day of <HI>October</HI> 1739, the chief Corner-&s;tone of the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e was laid by the Right Honourable <HI>Micajah Perry,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> then Lord Mayor, and by the Committee ap|pointed for that Purpo&s;e, in the Place where <HI>Stocks-market</HI> u&s;ed to be kept, with an In&s;cription on it &s;ignifying as much, and giving the Names of the Gentlemen of the &s;aid Committee, the Sheriffs, and the Architect; but perhaps it may be as much to the latter Gentleman's Credit, not to name him, as to name him; for Connoi&s;&s;eurs find &s;o many Faults with the De&s;ign, that if what they &s;ay is true, tho' it may be a co&s;tly Building, yet will it not do any great Honour to this famous Metropolis, among good Judges.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal Exchange</HI> is the greate&s;t Bur&s;e in the World. It is &s;o well known, and has been &s;o often de&s;cribed, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to enter upon it here. 'Tis &s;aid, that it co&s;t above 80,000<HI>l.</HI> in building; and yet the Intere&s;t of the Money was a great while an&s;wered by the Rent made of the Shops and Vaults: but now the Trade that u&s;ed to be carried on there, is &s;o di&s;per&s;ed in other Places, that it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to do &s;o. According to Archi|tectural Critici&s;m, the Building has numerous Faults: the Turret is egregiou&s;ly bad, tho' a very expen&s;ive Part of the Structure.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109">The Ho&s;pital of <HI>Bethlehem</HI> is a noble Pile; but we &s;hall take notice of it under the Head of HOSPITALS.</P>

<P>The <HI>College of Phy&s;icians</HI> in <HI>Warwick-lane</HI> is a beautiful and magnificent Structure, built of Brick and Stone, and is one of the fine&s;t Ornaments of the City, tho' built in a Place where all its Beauties are in a manner buried.

<P>On the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Theatre is another, of Sir <HI>John Cutler</HI>; and in <HI>June</HI> 1739, a very fine Bu&s;to, carved out of a Block of White Marble, was erected in the great Hall of this College, to the Honour of the famous Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> with the follow|ing In&s;cription on its Marble Pediment.

<P>In the Hall of this Theatre is a capital Picture of <HI>Hans Holbein,</HI> in which is the Portrait of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. &s;itting in his Chair, delivering the Charter which he granted to the College of Phy|&s;icians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is &s;aid, the Company have been offered 800<HI>l.</HI> for this Piece; for it is highly valuable as it is the only remaining Picture of the fir&s;t Painter of Note in this Kingdom (his celebrated Piece, called <HI>The Dance of Death,</HI> being de&s;troy'd by Fire); and not only pre&s;ents the King taken from the Life, but al&s;o the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians of that Time, when the Incorporation was granted; and excepting the famous Family-piece, by <HI>Titian,</HI> in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and another of the <HI>Pem|broke</HI> Family, at <HI>Wilton,</HI> painted by <HI>Vandyke,</HI> it is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t valuable <HI>Portrait-picture</HI> in the Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Thanet-hou&s;e,</HI> in <HI>Alder&s;gate-&s;treet,</HI> built by <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> is intirely worthy of him; but it is now let out to a Tavern, and other Trades, as unworthy of its Founder, as of its Architect.</P>
<P>The Palace of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> is over-again&s;t it. It is an old Building, and no otherwi&s;e remark|able, than that it is let out to Trade&s;men chiefly, and has not been for a great while the Re&s;idence of its Bi&s;hop, who has a Country Palace at <HI>Fulham</HI>; and the Air of the <HI>Court</HI> being judged better than that of the <HI>City, Whitehall</HI> has been preferred to it for a Town-re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Several Acts of Parliament have pa&s;&s;ed within the&s;e few Years, for building a new Bridge over the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and Three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Lotteries have been given for that End. It was at fir&s;t re|&s;olved to be built at the <HI>Hor&s;e-ferry</HI> over to <HI>Lam|beth</HI>; but tho&s;e who had mo&s;t Influence changing their Minds, the De&s;ign was altered, and it is now
<PB N="110" REF="111">
begun at the <HI>Wool&s;taple,</HI> near <HI>Palace-yard,</HI> and is to be carry'd to <HI>Stangate</HI> on the oppo&s;ite Side. Great Powers are given by this Act to Commi&s;&s;ioners to agree with Per&s;ons who own Hou&s;es and Lands on either Shore: and they intend to pull down whole Streets about <HI>Palace-yard,</HI> and <HI>Channing-row,</HI> be&s;ides what they are to do on the <HI>Surry</HI> Side, for the more commodious Pa&s;&s;age to it. In &s;hort, if the Plan be pur&s;ued that is propo&s;ed, it will be a very con&s;iderable Work: but yet, we mu&s;t &s;ay, that the greate&s;t Part of the Expence would have been &s;aved, had it been built where fir&s;t propo&s;ed; and as the Money is rai&s;ed by Lotteries, which are always of pernicious Con|&s;equence to Trade, it had been perhaps as well, in the pre&s;ent Juncture of the publick Affairs, that the neare&s;t way had been followed: and I may pre&s;ume to intimate, that tho' the Hor&s;e-ferry were to be rejected, yet <HI>Scotland-yard,</HI> which is a great Body of ruinous or decaying Buildings, and joins to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and to which the main Streets point, leading down from <HI>Pall-mall, Picadilly,</HI> &amp;c. by <HI>Charing-cro&s;s,</HI> would have been, in my humble Opinion, a preferable Situation. 'Tis certain it might have been effected there, not only with more Conveniency, but at an ea&s;y Expence to what now mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e; and there had been no need to have pulled down the Hou&s;es of Trade&s;men, and others, which brought in tolerable Rents, by their Vicinity to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,</HI> and the Two Hou&s;es of Parliament. Several Stone Piers are already erected in the <HI>Thames,</HI> and they are proceeding with one of the noble&s;t Streets of Hou&s;es, that are any where to be &s;een, fronting <HI>Palace-yard.</HI> And here we &s;hall leave it for this time, chu&s;ing rather to de&s;cribe <HI>what is,</HI> than what is <HI>de&s;igned to be</HI>; &s;ince the Time this Work will take up &s;till, may &s;ubject it to &s;everal Alterations, now not ea&s;y to be fore&s;een.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Bridewell</HI> is as well an Hou&s;e of Correction as an Ho&s;pital. It was formerly the King's City Palace, but given to the City by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. for the reclaiming of idle Per&s;ons, Vagrants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for bringing up Lads to Handicraft Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es.</P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>St. Bartholomew</HI>'s Ho&s;pital adjoins to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Ho&s;pital.

<P>This Ho&s;pital relieves about 600 Patients daily with Lodging, Diet, Phy&s;ick, and Chirurgery.</P>

<P>We &s;hall only further ob&s;erve in general, That tho&s;e noble Foundations, added to the innumerable Alms-hou&s;es which are to be &s;een in almo&s;t every Part of <HI>London,</HI> make it certain, that there is no City in the World can &s;hew the like Number of Charities from private Hands, there being not le&s;s than Twenty thou&s;and People maintain'd of Cha|rity, be&s;ides the Charities of Schooling for Chil|dren, and be&s;ides the Collections at the annual Fea&s;ts of &s;everal Kinds, where Money is given for putting out Children Apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a great Number of which owe their Ri&s;e to the Period of Time included in 40 Years pa&s;t; &s;o that the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> have no Rea&s;on to boa&s;t, that there were greater Benefactions and Acts of Charity to the Poor given in their Days, than in our Prote&s;tant Times. And this is, indeed, one of the principal Rea&s;ons for my making mention of it in this Place; for let any par|ticular Age be &s;ingled out, and let the Charities of this Age, for about 40 Years pa&s;t, and the Sums of Money be&s;towed by Prote&s;tants in this Nation on mere Acts of Charity to the Poor, not reckon|ing Gifts to the Church, be ca&s;t up, it will appear they are greater by far, than can be found in <HI>Eng|land</HI> in any the like Number of Years, take the Time when we will.</P>

<HEAD>VI. Of the Churches of <HI>London, We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Southwark.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE are within the Walls of <HI>London,</HI> 97 Pari&s;hes; without the Walls, 17; in the Out-Pari&s;hes in <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> in the Bills of Mortality, 21; and in the City and Liberty of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> 10; in all, 145. We &s;hall as briefly as po&s;&s;ible touch upon the mo&s;t remarkable Churches.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t Place, That the Churches in <HI>London</HI> are rather convenient than fine, not adorn'd with Pomp and Pageantry, as in <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Countries; but, like the true Prote&s;tant Plainne&s;s, have very little Ornament either within or with|out.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t famous of all the Churches in the City, and of all the Prote&s;tant Churches in the World, is the Cathedral of <HI>St. Paul</HI>; an Edifice exceeding|ly beautiful and magnificent, with fewer Faults than are to be found in any Building of the like Nature and Extent; tho' &s;ome, who would be thought to have Skill in Architecture, are plea&s;ed to &s;ay there are many, and particularly cen&s;ure it for its Heavi|ne&s;s, tho' perhaps it would be found, that the Fault is in their not con&s;idering &s;eparately the Beauty and Proportion of every Part, in order to enter into the Nature and De&s;ign of the whole Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121">The va&s;t Extent of the horizontal Arch of the Cupola, which &s;upports a Stone Lantern near 70 Feet high, may well account for the Strength of the Piers and Butments below: Eight of which &s;up|port the Whole of that prodigious Weight. And tho' common Ob&s;ervers a&s;&s;ert, that tho&s;e Piers, as al&s;o the Piers of all the Arches within-&s;ide, are too thick and heavy, yet, whoever knows any thing of the Rules of Architecture, mu&s;t allow them to be as &s;lender as the Strictne&s;s of tho&s;e Rules would admit of; for the Thickne&s;s of each Pier is not one Third Part of the Void of each Arch. And as to the Piers which &s;upport the Dome, they, when com|par'd with tho&s;e that &s;upport the Cupola of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> come out to be but one Third Part of the Bigne&s;s of the latter, the one mea&s;uring 240 Feet in Circumference, the other not quite 80; yet there is not a great deal of Difference in the Dimen&s;ions and Weight of the Two Cupola's. For that of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s is con&s;iderably larger and higher in Propor|tion to the Piers that &s;upport it, and to the Body of the Church, than that of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s. Wherefore I may venture, upon the whole, to a&s;&s;ert, that were we to compare every Part of the Two Buildings together, we &s;hall find <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s to be much le&s;s liable to the Objection of being a heavy Pile, than <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The chief Rea&s;on, as I imagine, why this Church is cen&s;ur'd for Heavine&s;s, is, not that it is really &s;o in it&s;elf, but appears &s;o, compar'd with the <HI>Gothick</HI> Architecture, which is more familiar to &s;ome Per|&s;ons than the other, and admits of an extravagant Airine&s;s and Lightne&s;s In that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of Building the De&s;igner is bound down to no Rules of Proportion but what his own F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ncy &s;ug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> whereas in the other, the Dimen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ns of every individual Member are a&s;certained, which cannot be deviated from with|out occa&s;ioning a Fault. The Height of every

Arch hath a fix'd Proportion to its Breadth; the Doors, Windows and their Ornaments are the &s;ame; the Intercolumniations and their Intablatures are all confin'd to certain Admea&s;urement. But who ever found that Exactne&s;s ob&s;erv'd in any <HI>Gothick</HI> Stru|cture? It mu&s;t be allowed there are Pieces of that Sort of Architecture, that, in the Whole, look very augu&s;t and venerable. Yet let any one view the va&s;t Stone Buttre&s;&s;es round the Out&s;ide of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Abbey, and &s;ee what Confu&s;ion of Lines, and Breaks they occa&s;ion in the Per&s;pective, and they will then ea&s;ily account for the Lightne&s;s of the In&s;ide of that Building; for they are tho&s;e Buttre&s;&s;es, which by extending &s;o far out, &s;upport the whole Structure, more than its Walls or Pillars. This I mention for the &s;ake of common Ob&s;ervers only; for to the Judicious it is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren</HI> had the Satisfaction to find the injudicious Reprovers of his Work confuted by the Approbation of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters in <HI>Europe,</HI> who allow'd, That the Church of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> which is the mo&s;t &s;tupendous Structure in the World, only exceeds <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s with re&s;pect to the Large|ne&s;s of its Dimen&s;ions, its rich <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Work, the beautiful Marble, of which both its Out&s;ide and In|&s;ide intirely con&s;i&s;t, the latter in different Colours, its Statues, Paintings, Gildings, Altars, and Ora|tories; Ornaments not allowed of in Prote&s;tant Churches.</P>
<P>Had the In&s;ide of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s been adorned in as profu&s;e and pompous a Manner as <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s, it would have attracted the Admiration of &s;uperficial Criticks, &s;o that they would never have been able to di&s;cover the Faults they now pretend to find; Faults which can only be attributed to the Plainne&s;s of its Materials. But to &s;uch as are real Judges, the Harmony, Proportion and Beauty of Buildings are equally admirable, whether they be executed in plain
<PB N="122" REF="123">
Free-&s;tone, or the mo&s;t beautiful Marble; whether the Carvings or Mouldings be gilt or not; the Re|ce&s;&s;es or Panels in the Walls be curiou&s;ly painted, or only plai&s;ter'd.</P>
<P>In the Year 1707, the Hou&s;e of Commons had it under Con&s;ideration, whether the Cupola &s;hould be cover'd with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an authentick Account of the Matter.</NOTE> Copper or Lead; and upon Inquiry into which was mo&s;t expedient and lea&s;t expen&s;ive, it appear'd, that the Covering of Lead would amount to about 170 Tons, and the Expence thereof, in|cluding Workman&s;hip, was e&s;timated at 2500<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>The Copper Covering was computed at Eleven Tons, Three hundred, Three Quarters and odd Pounds, and the Expence was e&s;timated at 3050<HI>l.</HI> Upon which the Hou&s;e fixed upon a Copper Cover|ing.</P>
<P>But when the Bill which had a Clau&s;e in it for that Purpo&s;e, went up to the Lords, their Lord&s;hips left out the Clau&s;e; upon which the Commons de|&s;ired a Conference, alleging, that Copper was pre|ferable to any other Covering, as well in re&s;pect of Duration as Lightne&s;s; for that Lead being &s;ub|ject to frequent Repairs, the nece&s;&s;ary Scaffolding for that Purpo&s;e at any one time, would exceed the Difference of Charge between that and Copper: be&s;ides, that frequent Scaffolding would very much prejudice the Building. But the Se&s;&s;ions clo&s;ing the &s;ame Day, put an End to the Affair, and there were no Conferences; tho' the preceding Rea&s;ons were what the Commons intended to offer, if there had been one.</P>
<P>It very probably was upon this Occa&s;ion, that Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> is &s;aid to have declared his Opinion in the Hou&s;e of Commons, when &s;ome Gentlemen doubted whether the Cupola would bear the Leaden Covering, that it was able to bear 7000 Tons more than what is now upon it, and that he would under|take
<PB N="123" REF="124">
to rai&s;e a Spire of Stone upon the whole 100 Feet higher than the Cro&s;s now &s;tands.</P>
<P>The Expence of this magnificent Structure, as it was laid before the Parliament <HI>Anno</HI> 1711, including the Building of the Chapter-hou&s;e near it, a neat and elegant Fabrick, purcha&s;ing of Property, together with the E&s;timate of what was nece&s;&s;ary to com|plete the whole, in which was concluded a Ring of Twelve Bells, not yet put up, nor ca&s;t, as al&s;o the Furniture for the Choir, amounted to 810,380<HI>l.</HI> 4<HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things, that were not &s;o ea&s;y for every one to know, we have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to inlarge upon. Our Bounds will not permit us to &s;ay all that the Subject requires, and we would not dwell upon Points which every one knows, or may ea&s;ily inform him&s;elf of by his own Ob&s;ervation, or from other Writers, in relation to this famous Structure.</P>
<P>But one thing it will be requi&s;ite to ob&s;erve further, which every one does not know, and which there|fore I &s;hall mention.</P>
<P>This able Architect, Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren,</HI> at the fir&s;t &s;etting about the Church, would have had its Situation removed a little to the North, to &s;tand ju&s;t on the Spot of Ground which is taken up by <HI>Pater-no&s;ter Row,</HI> and the Buildings on either Side; &s;o that the North-&s;ide of the Church &s;hould have &s;tood open to <HI>Newgate-&s;treet,</HI> and the South-&s;ide to the Ground on which the Church now &s;tands.</P>
<P>By this Situation, the Ea&s;t-end of the Church, would have looked directly down the main Street of the City, <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI>; and for the We&s;t-end, <HI>Lud|gate</HI> having been removed a little North, the main Street called <HI>Ludgate-&s;treet,</HI> and <HI>Ludgate-hill,</HI> would only have &s;loped a little W. S. W. as they do now irregularly Two Ways, one within, and the other without the Gate, and all the Street beyond <HI>Fleet-Bridge</HI> would have received no Alteration at all.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125">By this Situation, the common Thorough-fare of the City would have been removed at a little far|ther Di&s;tance from the Work, and we &s;hould not then have been obliged to walk ju&s;t under the very Wall, as we do now, which makes the Work appear out of all Per&s;pective, and is the chief Rea&s;on of the Objections I have mention'd, as to the out&s;ide Appearance; whereas, had it been viewed at a little Di&s;tance, the Building would have been &s;een infi|nitely to more Advantage.</P>
<P>Had Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> been allowed this Situation, he would then, al&s;o, have had more room for the Ornament of the We&s;t-end, which, tho' a mo&s;t beautiful Work, would have been much more &s;o then, and he would have added a circular Piazza to it, after the Model of that of <HI>Rome,</HI> but much more magnificent, and an Obeli&s;k of Marble in the Centre of the Circle, exceeding any thing that the World can &s;hew of its Kind, of modern Work.</P>
<P>But the Circum&s;tance of Things hindered this noble De&s;ign, and the City being almo&s;t rebuilt before he obtain'd an Order and Provi&s;ion for laying the Foundation, he was pre&s;cribed to the narrow Spot where it now &s;tands, in which the Building, however magnificent in it&s;elf, &s;tands with great Di&s;|advantage as to the Pro&s;pect of it. The Inconve|niencies of this were &s;o apparent when the Church was fini&s;h'd, that Leave was at length, tho' not without Difficulty, obtain'd, to pull down one whole Row of Hou&s;es on the North-&s;ide of the Body of the Church, to make Way for the noble Balu&s;trade of ca&s;t Iron, rai&s;ed upon an hand&s;ome Stone Wall of above a Yard high, that &s;urrounds the Church-yard; and, indeed, to admit Light into the Church, as well as to pre&s;erve it from the Danger of Fire.</P>
<P>That admirable Architect met with no better Suc|ce&s;s in a Plan which was one of the mo&s;t beautiful
<PB N="125" REF="126">
that could enter the Mind of Man, and would have made this City the noble&s;t on Earth: this I &s;hall relate in the Words of a certain Author, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Fire of <HI>London</HI> furni&s;h'd the mo&s;t perfect Occa&s;ion that can ever happen in any City, to rebuild it with Pomp and Regularity. This Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren</HI> fore&s;aw, and, 'tis &s;aid, offer'd a Scheme which would have made it the Wonder of the World. He propo&s;ed to have laid out one large Street from <HI>Aldgate</HI> to <HI>Temple-Bar</HI>; in the middle of which was to have been a large Square capable of containing the new Church of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, with a proper Di&s;tance for the View all round; whereby that huge Building would not have been cooped up, as 'tis at pre&s;ent, in &s;uch a manner, as no-where to be &s;een to Advantage at all; but would have had a long and ample Vi&s;ta at each End, to have reconcil'd it to a proper Point of View, and give it one great Benefit, which in all Probability, it mu&s;t now want for ever. He far|ther propo&s;ed to rebuild all the Pari&s;h-churches in &s;uch a Manner, as to be &s;een at the End of every Vi&s;ta of Hou&s;es, and di&s;per&s;ed in &s;uch Di&s;tances from each other, as to appear neither too thick, nor thin in Pro&s;pect, and give a proper Heighten|ing to the whole Bulk of the City, as it filled the Land&s;chape. La&s;tly, he propo&s;ed to build all the Hou&s;es uniform, and &s;upported on a Piazza, like that of <HI>Covent-Garden:</HI> and by the Water-&s;ide from the Bridge to the <HI>Temple,</HI> he had planned a long and broad Wharf, or Quay, where he de|&s;igned to have ranged all the Halls that belong to the &s;everal Companies of the City, with proper Ware-hou&s;es for Merchants between, to vary the Edifices, and make it at once one of the mo&s;t beautiful and mo&s;t u&s;eful Ranges of Structure in the World. But the Hurry of Rebuilding, and
<PB N="126" REF="127">
the Di&s;putes of Property, prevented this glorious Scheme from taking Place."</Q></P>
<P>When this great Man found he could not carry this Point, he propo&s;ed what we have already men|tion'd; but, as we have ob&s;erv'd, with as little Suc|ce&s;s as the above grand Scheme; private Property, on this Occa&s;ion, as it does on mo&s;t others, get|ting the better both of publick Utility and publick Spirit.</P>
<P>The new Churches at <HI>Lime-hou&s;e, Ratcliffe-highway, Spital-fields, Old-&s;treet,</HI> the <HI>Strand, Or|mond-&s;treet, Hanover-&s;quare,</HI> the <HI>Hor&s;e-ferry, Blooms|bury,</HI> I can but ju&s;t mention, tho' they de&s;erve to be taken notice of by Travellers. But the latter, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, was the fir&s;t Building, wherein was in|troduced a Portico after the Manner of the antient Temples. The Body of the Church is a ma&s;terly Performance; but the placing, for a Weather-cock, the Statue of a Prince famous for good Sen&s;e and Steadine&s;s, is an Ab&s;urdity peculiar to the Church of <HI>Bloom&s;bury.</HI></P>
<P>The new-built Steeples or Towers of <HI>St. Marga|ret</HI>'s <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter, St. Michael</HI>'s <HI>Cornhill, St. Mary Aldermary, St. Sepulchre</HI>'s, <HI>St. Chri&s;topher</HI>'s, <HI>St. Dun&s;tan</HI>'s in the Ea&s;t, <HI>St. Clement</HI>'s-<HI>Danes,</HI> and the new-built Churches of <HI>St. Mary Woolnoth, Bi&s;hops-gate, St. Leonard Shoreditch, St. Catharine Cole|man, St. Martin</HI>'s in the Fields, <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s, I can only mention.</P>
<P>Among the Beauties of <HI>London,</HI> mu&s;t be num|bered the admirable Church of <HI>St. Stephen Wal|brooke,</HI> the <HI>Temple-Church, Bow-Church, St. Cle|ment</HI>'s-<HI>Danes, St. Paul Covent-Garden</HI>; and that incomparable Piece called <HI>The Banqueting-hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> now made u&s;e of as a Chapel. This was the De&s;ign of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> as one Pavilion for that admirable Model he gave for a Palace. And if this Specimen has ju&s;tly commanded the Admiration of
<PB N="127" REF="128">
Mankind, what mu&s;t the fini&s;h'd Piece have done! It is to be hoped <HI>Britain</HI> will one Day have the Glory to accompli&s;h it, according to this Plan, and then it will far exceed all the Palaces of the Univer&s;e. Here is Strength with Politene&s;s, Ornament with Simplicity, and Beauty with Maje&s;ty. It is without Di&s;pute one of the noble&s;t Structures in the World. The Ceiling is an admirable fine Piece of Painting by <HI>Rubens.</HI></P>
<P>The Abbey or Collegiate Church of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> is a venerable old Pile of Building; but begins to appears with a new Face; for a Tower is actually fini&s;h'd at the We&s;t-end, and another is about. The Beginning of a fine and co&s;tly Spire was al&s;o laid &s;ome time ago, near the Middle of the Edifice, which however is yet uncertain whether it will be proceeded on or not. The We&s;t Window fronting the&s;e Towers is one of the mo&s;t beautiful in Gla&s;s Painting that has been done of late Years; and the Window al&s;o fronting <HI>King-&s;treet,</HI> fini&s;h'd in the Deanry of the late Bi&s;hop <HI>Atterbury,</HI> is one of the fine&s;t modern Performances of its kind.</P>
<P>We are al&s;o a&s;&s;ur'd, that the Hou&s;es adjoining to this venerable Building will be all pull'd down, and the Building left clear: an Action that will be as laudable when done, as it was &s;candalous when begun; the Effect of private Avarice, whereby that vene|rable Pile is &s;ubjected to the Hazards of Fire, and other Accidents, whenever an idle Servant &s;hall get in a &s;otti&s;h, a carele&s;s, or &s;leepy Fit.</P>
<P>But after all, this Building, tho' very expen&s;ive, is far le&s;s elegant than &s;everal other <HI>Gothick</HI> Stru|ctures. Its Out&s;ide can never be made beautiful; and within, it is extravagantly out of Proportion, with regard to the Height and Breadth of the middle Nef and Side-Ayles. The high Altar within&s;ide is a noble Piece, and had a wonderful fine Effect from the
<PB N="128" REF="129">
We&s;t Door, before the Organ lately erected inter|cepted its View.</P>
<P>The Towers at the We&s;t-end, which I have ju&s;t mention'd, as they &s;tand &s;o clo&s;e together, are not &s;ufficiently contracted in the carrying them up. The Four Pinacles have a very wretched Effect, when viewed in a diagonal Line. The Style of the Build|ing, &s;o far as is intire new Work, is a &s;ort of Med|ley, neither <HI>Gothick,</HI> nor any thing el&s;e. As &s;o many beautiful Structures of this Kind are to be &s;een, it is amazing, that any Architect &s;hould be above imitating them, when 'tis plain he cannot equal, much le&s;s excel them.</P>
<P>This Abbey is the Repo&s;itory of the deceas'd <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Kings and Nobility, and very fine Monuments are &s;een over the Graves of our antient Sovereigns: the Particulars are too long to enter into here.</P>
<P>The Monarchs of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are likewi&s;e al|ways crown'd here.</P>

<HEAD>VII. Of <HI>St. James</HI>'s <HI>Palace,</HI> the <HI>Parliament-Hou&s;e, We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Palace of <HI>St. James</HI>'s, tho' the Winter Receptacle of all the Pomp and Glory of this Kingdom, is really mean, in Compari&s;on of the glorious Court of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The Splendor of the Nobility, the Wealth and Greatne&s;s of the At|tendants, the Oeconomy of the Hou&s;e, and the real Grandeur of the whole Royal Family, out-does all the Courts of <HI>Europe</HI>; and yet this Palace comes beneath tho&s;e of the mo&s;t petty Princes in it; altho' there cannot be in the World a nobler Situation for a Royal Palace than <HI>Whitehall.</HI> And it is with &s;ome Concern, that we &s;ee &s;o fine a Spot become a Sacri|fice to private Spirit, &s;o much of it being given away to particular Families, as makes more remote than we might otherwi&s;e expect it to be, the Hope we might ju&s;tly have entertained, of &s;eeing a Palace built there, worthy of the Glory of our Monarchs.</P>
<P>Many Plans have been drawn for the rebuilding of this Palace; but the mo&s;t celebrated Draughts are tho&s;e of <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> and may be &s;een in Mr. <HI>Camp|bell</HI>'s <HI>Vitruvius Britannicus,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kent</HI>'s Edition of <HI>Jones</HI>'s Works. The la&s;t of the&s;e, if executed, would, for Magnificence and Beauty, tran&s;cend even the Temple of <HI>Solomon,</HI> if we are to form a Judg|ment from the Plans given of that famous Edifice. But 'tis a Que&s;tion whether the Expence would not exceed that of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> which co&s;t Forty Millions of <HI>Roman</HI> Crowns.</P>
<P>As the Court is now &s;tated, all the Offices and Places for Bu&s;ine&s;s are &s;catter'd about, here and there.</P>
<P>The Parliament meets as they u&s;ed to do, while the Court was at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> in the King's Old Palace; nor can it be &s;aid but the Place is made
<PB N="130" REF="131">
tolerably convenient for them, and is &s;till more &s;o of late Years than it u&s;ed to be; for the <HI>Court of Re|que&s;ts</HI> is intirely new-built, and made a noble Room; and other Conveniencies are added. The Hou&s;e of Commons meet in the Chapel of the Palace at <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> dedicated to St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and fitted for this Purpo&s;e by that admirable Architect Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren.</HI></P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Lords is a venerable old Place, tho' it mu&s;t be &s;aid to be much &s;treightened in the &s;everal Avenues to it, and Rooms above it; and particular|ly the matted Gallery, the Lobby, the back Ways the King goes to it, are very &s;hort of the requi&s;ite Dignity or Convenience of the Place, and of the Glory of a King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who there meets the Peers and Commons of his Realm, who toge|ther con&s;titute the mo&s;t augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly in the World.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> a very noble <HI>Gothick</HI> Building, in which are held the Courts of Ju&s;tice, is &s;aid to be the large&s;t Room in the World: its Roof, which is the fine&s;t of its Kind that can be &s;een, is 100 Feet wide. And here is held the Coronation-Fea&s;t of the Kings and Queens of <HI>England</HI>; al&s;o the Courts of Chancery, King's Bench and Common Pleas; and above Stairs, that of the Exchequer. But it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that it makes no very advantageous Appearance without, re&s;embling at a Di&s;tance a great Barn, of 300 Feet long; within, it is filled with Book&s;ellers Shops, and tho&s;e of other Trades; tho' the Alteration lately made in the Chancery and King's Bench Courts, at the upper End of the Hall, and tho&s;e for the Common Pleas on the Right-hand of it, give it a much better Appearance than it had before.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the Hall are kept the numerous Of|fices belonging to the Exchequer of <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome of them very dark and inconvenient; and &s;uch as to

<HEAD>IX. Of the Gates of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Gates of the City of <HI>London</HI> are &s;even, be&s;ides Po&s;terns. Two of them were demo|li&s;h'd at the Fire, but beautifully rebuilt. The&s;e are <HI>Ludgate</HI> and <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ludgate</HI> is a Pri&s;on for Debt, for Freemen of the City only.</P>
<P><HI>Newgate</HI> is a Pri&s;on for Criminals, both in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> and for Debtors al&s;o for <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> being the County Gaol.</P>
<P><HI>Moregate</HI> is al&s;o rebuilt, and is a very beautiful Gateway, the Arch being near Twenty Feet high, which was done to give room for the City Train'd-bands to go through to the Artillery Ground, where they mu&s;ter, and that they might march with their Pikes advanced; for then they had Pikemen in every Regiment, as well in the Army as in the Militia, which &s;ince that, is quite left off. This makes the Gate look a little out of Proportion, to tho&s;e who know not the Occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><HI>Cripplegate</HI> is very old, and makes but a mean Figure.</P>
<P><HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI> is newly rebuilt, but not with the Elegance that might have been wi&s;h'd.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137"><HI>Alder&s;gate</HI> and <HI>Aldgate</HI> both make a very hand|&s;ome Appearance.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Gates are given by the City to the chief Officers to live in, and are very convenient Dwellings.</P>
<P><HI>Temple-Bar</HI> is the only Gate which is erected at the Extent of the City Liberties, and this was occa|&s;ion'd by &s;ome needful Ceremonies, as at the Proclaim|ing any King or Queen of <HI>England,</HI> at which Time the Gates are &s;hut. The Herald at Arms knocks hard at the Door, the Sheriffs of the City call back, a&s;k|ing, Who is there? Then the Herald an&s;wers, <HI>I come to proclaim,</HI> &amp;c. according to the Name of the Prince who is to &s;ucceed to the Crown, and repeat|ing the Titles of <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI> &amp;c. at which the Sheriffs open, and bid them welcome; and &s;o they go on to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> where they make the la&s;t Proclamation.</P>
<P>There was formerly another Gate belonging to the City of <HI>London,</HI> called the <HI>Po&s;tern-Gate</HI> at <HI>Tower-hill</HI>; but it being partly demoli&s;h'd by Time, it is now turned into private Buildings.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> had no le&s;s than Five Gates, and all &s;tanding within a &s;mall Compa&s;s of Ground; as, fir&s;t, The noble <HI>Gothick</HI> Gate at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> which is left &s;tanding for the Beauty of its Workman&s;hip. Se|condly, A Gate a little farther, where <HI>King-&s;treet</HI> begins, which was a good old Structure, and pull'd down a few Years ago to inlarge the Pa&s;&s;age. Thirdly, A Gate where now <HI>Union-&s;treet</HI> is, com|municating <HI>King-&s;treet</HI> with the <HI>New Palace-yard</HI>; and this has been &s;everal Years demoli&s;h'd, and the &s;aid little Street built where it &s;tood. Fourthly, A Gate leading from <HI>New Palace-yard</HI> to <HI>St. Mar|garet's-lane,</HI> which has been lately demoli&s;h'd, to inlarge that Pa&s;&s;age, by which the King goes to the Hou&s;e of Lords. Fifthly, The <HI>Gate-hou&s;e,</HI> near the We&s;t-end of the Abbey, which is an old Building,
<PB N="137" REF="138">
u&s;ed for the publick Gaol of the City of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e we may al&s;o add, the <HI>Water-gate</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> in <HI>New Palace-yard,</HI> near which is begun to be erected the new Bridge.</P>

<P>The la&s;t Three are, without Doubt, the greate&s;t in the World of tho&s;e Kinds.&mdash;There are more|over Multitudes of Coal-merchants, who have Coal|wharfs, from the <HI>Hermitage</HI> one Way, to the <HI>Hor&s;e|ferry</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> another, which may be deemed &s;o many Markets, tho' not publick ones.</P>
<P>The&s;e Markets are &s;o con&s;iderable in them&s;elves, that they merit a larger and more particular De&s;crip|tion, than I have room for. I &s;hall, however, briefly ob&s;erve of them, That of the fifteen Fle&s;h|markets for Provi&s;ions, Seven of them are of antient Standing; but the others are erected &s;ince the Increa&s;e of the City. The old ones are, <HI>Leaden-hall, White|chapel, Newgate-market, Southwark, Clare, St. James</HI>'s, and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>; to which &s;ome add <HI>Honey|lane,</HI> and the&s;e are &s;o con&s;iderable, have &s;uch Numbers of Buyers, and &s;uch an infinite Quantity of Provi&s;ions of all Sorts, Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, and Fowl, that e&s;pecially, with regard to <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> no City in the World can equal them.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="141">The great Market called <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> (of which a certain <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador &s;aid, There was as much Meat &s;old in it in one Month, as would &s;uffice all <HI>Spain</HI> for a Year) contains Three large Squares, every Square having &s;everal Outlets into divers Streets, and all into one another. The fir&s;t, and chief, is called the <HI>Beef-market,</HI> which has two large Gates, one into <HI>Leaden-hall-&s;treet,</HI> one into <HI>Grace-church-&s;treet</HI>; and two &s;maller, <HI>viz.</HI> one by a long paved Pa&s;&s;age leading into <HI>Lime-&s;treet,</HI> and one under a Gateway from the &s;econd Square. In this Square, every <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> is kept a Market for raw Hides, tann'd Leather, and Shoemakers Tools; and in the Ware-hou&s;es, up Stairs, on the Ea&s;t and South-&s;ides of the Square, is the great Market for <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> Bays.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Square is divided into two Oblongs: in the fir&s;t is the Fi&s;h-market, and in the other, a Market for Country Higglers, who bring &s;mall Things, as Pork, Butter, Eggs, Pigs, Rabbets, Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the North Part of the Fi&s;h-market, the Place being too large for the Fi&s;hmongers U&s;e, are the Stalls of the Town Butchers for Mutton and Veal, the be&s;t and large&s;t of which, that <HI>England</HI> can pro|duce, are to be bought there; and the Ea&s;t Part is a Fle&s;h-market for Country Butchers.</P>
<P>The third and la&s;t Square, which is al&s;o very large, is divided into Three Parts: round the Circumference, is the Butter-market, with all the Sorts of Higglery Goods, as before: the South Part is the Poultry-market, and the Bacon-market; and the Centre is an Herb-market. And there have been, lately, &s;till more Conveniences and Additions made to this prodigious Market, which we have not room to particularize.</P>
<P>All the other Markets follow the &s;ame Method in proportion to the Room they have for it.</P>
<P>There are Two Corn-markets; <HI>viz. Bear-quay</HI> and <HI>Queenhith.</HI> To the fir&s;t comes all the va&s;t Quantity
<PB N="141" REF="142">
of Corn that is brought into the City by Sea, from the Counties which lie commodious for that Carriage; and here Corn may be &s;aid not to be &s;old by Cart-loads, or Hor&s;e-loads, but by Ship-loads; and except the Corn-chambers and Magazines in <HI>Holland,</HI> when the Fleets come in from <HI>Dantzick</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> the whole World cannot equal the Quantity bought and &s;old here; for no Quantity can be wanted either for Home Con&s;umption, or for Foreign Exportation, but the Corn-factors, who are the Managers of this Market, are ready to &s;upply it.</P>
<P><HI>Queenhith</HI> is chiefly for Malt; the Barley of which takes up the Ground of &s;o many Hundred thou&s;and Acres of Land in the Counties of <HI>Surrey, Bucks, Berks, Oxford, Southampton,</HI> and <HI>Wilts,</HI> and is called We&s;t Country Malt.</P>
<P>It is true, there is a very great Quantity of Malt, and of other Corn too, brought to &s;ome other Places on the River, and &s;old there; <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>Milford-lane,</HI> above the Bridge, and the <HI>Hermitage,</HI> below the Bridge; but this is but, in general, a Branch of the Trade of the other Places.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted, that <HI>Queenhith</HI> is al&s;o a very great Market for Meal, as well as Malt, and, perhaps, the greate&s;t in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;els which bring this Malt and Meal to <HI>Queenhith,</HI> are worthy Ob&s;ervation. They are remarkable for the Length of the Ve&s;&s;el, and the Burden they carry, and yet the little Water they draw; for &s;ome of tho&s;e Barges carry above a Thou|&s;and Quarters of Malt at a time, and yet do not draw Two Feet of Water; and a Thou&s;and Quarters of Malt mu&s;t be granted to be, at lea&s;t, a Hundred Tons Burden; and &s;ome of the&s;e large Barges come as far as from <HI>Abington,</HI> which is about One hundred and Fifty Miles from <HI>London,</HI> if we mea&s;ure by the River.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="143">The next Market, which is more than ordinary remarkable, is the Coal-market at <HI>Billin&s;gate.</HI> This is kept every Morning on the broad Place ju&s;t at the Head of <HI>Billin&s;gate-dock,</HI> and the Place is called <HI>Room-land:</HI> from what old forgotten Original it has that Name, Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent. I need not, except for the &s;ake of Strangers, take Notice, that the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Parts adjacent, as al&s;o all the South of <HI>England,</HI> is &s;upplied with Coals, called therefore <HI>Sea-coal,</HI> from <HI>Newca&s;tle upon Tine,</HI> and from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Durham,</HI> and <HI>Northumberland.</HI> This Trade is &s;o con&s;iderable, that it is e&s;teemed the great Nur&s;ery of our Seamen. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay more of it in my Account of the Northern Parts of <HI>England.</HI> The Quantity of Coals, which, one Year with an|other, are burnt and con&s;umed in and about this City, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about 500,000 Chalders, every Chalder containing 36 Bu&s;hels, and generally weigh|ing 3000 Weight.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Coals are bought and &s;old on this little Spot of <HI>Room-land</HI>; and tho' &s;ometimes, e&s;pe|cially in ca&s;e of a War, or of contrary Winds, a Fleet of 500 to 700 Sail of Ships, comes up the River at a time, yet they never want a Market. The Brokers of the&s;e Coals, are called <HI>Crimps</HI>; the Ve&s;&s;els they load their Ships with at <HI>Newca&s;tle, Keels</HI>; and the Ships that bring them, <HI>Cats,</HI> and <HI>Hags,</HI> or <HI>Hag-boats, Fly-boats,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>The Increa&s;e of this Con&s;umption of Coals is another Evidence of the great Increa&s;e of the City of <HI>London</HI>; for, within a few Years pa&s;t, the Import of Coals was not, in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> &s;o great by very near half.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that as the City of <HI>London</HI> occa&s;ions the Con&s;umption of &s;o great a Quantity of Corn and Coals, &s;o the Mea&s;urement of them is under the In&s;pection of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen; and for the Direction of it, there is
<PB N="143" REF="144">
allowed a certain Number of Corn-meters, and Coal-meters, who&s;e Places are for Life, and bring them in a very con&s;iderable Income.</P>
<P>They have abundance of poor Men imploy'd under them, who are al&s;o called Meters, and are or ought to be Freemen of the City.</P>
<P>This is, indeed, a kind of Tax, as well upon the Coals as Corn; but the Buyer is abundantly recom|pen&s;ed, by being a&s;certained in his Mea&s;ure; for the &s;worn Meters are &s;o placed between the Buyer and the Seller, and have &s;o many Eyes upon them, (being be&s;ides Men of Character) that there is hardly ever any room for Complaint on this Head.</P>

<HEAD>XII. Of the Publick Schools and Libraries.</HEAD>
<P>WE mu&s;t be very brief in this Article; nor have we room to &s;ay anything of the private Schools, which are hardly to be number'd.</P>
<P>Near the Abbey at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> is the Royal <HI>Free-&s;chool,</HI> founded by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; it is not out|done even by tho&s;e of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Eton,</HI> for the excellent Scholars it has produced, and is in a very flouri&s;hing Condition. Several good Hou&s;es, and even Streets, are lately built in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><HI>St. Paul's</HI> School, founded by Dr. <HI>Colet,</HI> Dean of <HI>St. Paul's,</HI> is a fair Foundation for 153 Boys, to be taught <HI>gratis.</HI></P>

<P>As to the LIBRARIES, I can only mention 'em likewi&s;e in a cur&s;ory manner.

In <HI>Red|cro&s;s-&s;treet,</HI> near <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> an hand&s;ome Building was erected, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1727, by the late Dr. <HI>Daniel Williams,</HI> a Di&s;&s;enting Divine, for a publick Library for the U&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The valuable Collections, called the <HI>Cotton Library,</HI> is &s;o well known, that we &s;hall only mention the great Di&s;a&s;ter that befel it in the Year 1730, when a Fire happened, not thro' Over-care, we may be &s;ure, which burnt and defaced a great Number of valuable Manu&s;cripts. But mo&s;t happily it was di&s;|covered and extingui&s;hed, before it made &s;o great a De&s;truction as was at fir&s;t apprehended. The learned Keeper of this ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure, Dr. <HI>Bentley,</HI> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Trinity-college, Cambridge,</HI> who&s;e Labours have done &s;o much Honour to the Commonwealth of Learning, was the fir&s;t, we are told, to expre&s;s to &s;ome of his Friends, who came to condole with him the <HI>publick</HI> Lo&s;s, the great Joy he conceived that all his <HI>own Works</HI> had e&s;caped the Ravages of that furious Element, which had been &s;o little com|plai&s;ant to many curious Pieces of Antiquity. I would &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid all ill-natur'd In&s;inuations; but wi&s;h, that with all the Excellencies which adorn this learned Man's Character, the Age in which he lives might be able to hand down his Fame to &s;uc|ceeding Times, free from that private Spirit and Narrowne&s;s of Mind, of which his Enemies accu&s;e him. If he de&s;erves not the Ill-will of &s;uch, he

<P>I will not &s;ay, but that there may be more Ve&s;&s;els built at <HI>Schedam,</HI> and the Parts adjacent, than in the River <HI>Thames</HI>; but then it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> build for them&s;elves princi|pally, the <HI>Dutch</HI> for all the World,</P>
<P N="2">2. That almo&s;t all the Ships the <HI>Dutch</HI> have, are built there, whereas not one fifth Part of our Ship|ping is built in the <HI>Thames</HI>; but abundance of Ships are built at the Sea-ports in <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch as, at <HI>Newca&s;tle, Sunderland, Stockton, Whitby, Hull, Gainsborough, Grimsby, Lynn, Liverpole, Yarmouth, Alborough, Walder&s;wick, Ip&s;wich</HI> and <HI>Harwich,</HI> upon the Ea&s;t Coa&s;t; and at <HI>Shoreham, Arundel, Bright|helm&s;ton, Port&s;mouth, Southampton, Pool, Weymouth, Dartmouth, Plymouth,</HI> be&s;ides other Places, on the South Coa&s;t.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="146" REF="147">3. That we &s;ee more Ve&s;&s;els in le&s;s Room at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>; but &s;etting a&s;ide their Hoys, Bilanders, and Schouts, which are in great Numbers always there, being Ve&s;&s;els peculiar to their Inland and Coa&s;ting Navigation, you do not &s;ee more Ships, nor near &s;o many Ships of Force at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> as at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>That Part of the River <HI>Thames</HI> which is properly the Harbour, and where the Ships u&s;ually deliver or unload their Cargoes, is called the <HI>Pool,</HI> and begins at the Turning of the River out of <HI>Limehou&s;e Reach,</HI> and extends to the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e</HI> Quays: In this Compa&s;s I have had the Curio&s;ity to count the Ships as well as I could, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> and have found about 2000 Sail of all Sorts, not reckoning Barges, Lighters or Plea&s;ure-boats, and Yachts; but of Ve&s;&s;els that really go to Sea.</P>
<P>It is true, the River or <HI>Pool</HI> &s;eemed at that time to be pretty full of Ships; as al&s;o that I included the Ships which lay in <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Blackwall</HI> Reaches, and in the Wet Docks; but then I did not include the Men of War at the King's-yard, and in the Wet Dock at <HI>Deptford,</HI> which were not a few.</P>
<P>In the River there are, from <HI>Battle-bridge,</HI> on the <HI>Southwark</HI> Side; and the <HI>Hermitage-bridge,</HI> on the City Side; reckoning to <HI>Blackwall,</HI> inclu&s;ive,

<HEAD>XIV. Of the Manner by which the City is &s;upply'd with Water.</HEAD>
<P>NO City in the World is &s;o well furni&s;hed with Water as <HI>London,</HI> for their nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ions there, as well as for the extingui&s;hing of Fires, when they happen.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the great Convenience of Water, which be|ing every-where laid in the Streets in large Timber Pipes, as well from the <HI>Thames</HI> as the <HI>New River,</HI> tho&s;e Pipes are furni&s;hed with a Fire Plug, of which the Pari&s;h Officers have the Key; and when opened, let out not a Pipe, but, as one may &s;ay, a River of Water into the Streets; &s;o that making but a Dam in the Chanel, the whole Street is im|mediately under Water to &s;upply the Engines.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the great Number of admirable Engines, of which almo&s;t every Pari&s;h has one, and &s;ome Halls al&s;o, and &s;everal private Citizens, have them of their own; &s;o that no &s;ooner does a Fire break out, but the Hou&s;e is &s;urrounded with Engines, and a Flood of Water poured upon it, till it is extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;everal In&s;urance Offices, of which I have &s;poken in Article III. have each of them a certain Set of Men, whom they keep in con&s;tant Pay, and furni&s;h with Tools proper for their Work, and to whom they give Jack Caps of Leather, able to keep them from Hurt, if Brick or Timber, or any thing not of too great a Bulk, &s;hould fall upon them. The&s;e Men, whom they call <HI>Firemen,</HI> make it their
<PB N="148" REF="149">
Bu&s;ine&s;s to be ready at Call, all Hours, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in ca&s;e of Fire; and it mu&s;t be acknowledged, they are very dexterous, bold, diligent and &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>There are two great Engines for the rai&s;ing the <HI>Thames</HI> Water, one at the Bridge, and the other near <HI>Broken-wharf</HI>; and the&s;e rai&s;e &s;o great a Quan|tity of Water, that 'tis &s;aid, they are able to &s;upply every Hou&s;e throughout the whole City, with a running Pipe of Water up to the uppermo&s;t Story.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>New River,</HI> which is brought by an artificial Stream from <HI>Ware,</HI> continues to &s;upply the greater Part of the City; and that with more Ea&s;e than the <HI>Thames</HI> Engines. Of this River I &s;hall take farther Notice in my De&s;cription of <HI>Hertford|&s;hire,</HI> where it takes its Ri&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chel&s;ea Water-works,</HI> as they are called, are al&s;o of no &s;mall U&s;e for the new Buildings at that End of the Town; and a noble Cut, being a large, tho' not long River of it&s;elf, from the <HI>Thames</HI> to near <HI>Buckingham</HI> Garden-wall, and a great Re&s;ervoir of Water, in <HI>Hyde-park,</HI> produced by the &s;ame Undertaking, are no &s;mall Additions to the great Convenience we are &s;peaking of, for the Parts which they re&s;pectively &s;erve.</P>
<P>Formerly there were &s;everal beautiful Conduits in <HI>London,</HI> the Water of which was very &s;weet and good, and brought to them at a va&s;t Expence from &s;everal di&s;tant Springs in large Leaden Pipes: &s;ome of the&s;e were rebuilt &s;ince the Fire; but now the City is &s;o well &s;upplied with Water, that they are either quite demoli&s;h'd, or intirely out of U&s;e. That in <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> was pull'd down but very lately, and a Statue propo&s;ed to be built in its Place, in Honour to the great King <HI>William</HI> III. and it mu&s;t be own'd, that it is one of the mo&s;t commodious Places for &s;uch a Purpo&s;e in the whole City. But it being &s;et on Foot, as &s;ome thought, by Party on one Side,
<PB N="149" REF="150">
was rejected, from far le&s;s laudable Motives, by Party on the other.</P>
<P>It is a well known Fact, that the bringing the <HI>New River</HI> to <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> for the Benefit of the City, was the Ruin of the fir&s;t Attempter Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton.</HI></P>
<P>The Society of the <HI>Temple</HI> neglected to lay in Water till the Year 1737, when a terrible Fire hap|pening in it, which burnt down &s;everal Hou&s;es, and the <HI>Middle Temple</HI> Kitchen among the re&s;t, that Society agreed with the <HI>New River Water</HI> Company, and there are nowfine Conveniencies built for that Purpo&s;e in every Court and open Place, which are only to be uncovered on occa&s;ion of &s;uch Accidents. This Fire happened <HI>Jan.</HI> 3. 1736-7, and in it was con&s;umed one of the mo&s;t valuable Collections of Antiquity in <HI>England,</HI> belonging to <HI>James We&s;t,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> except the <HI>Cotton</HI> and <HI>Harleian</HI> Library.</P>

<P><HI>Hackney</HI> and <HI>Bromley</HI> are the fir&s;t Villages which begin the County of <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> Ea&s;t: for <HI>Bow,</HI> as reckon'd to <HI>Stepney,</HI> is a Part of the great Ma&s;s. This Town of <HI>Hackney</HI> is of great Extent, containing no le&s;s than Twelve Hamlets or &s;eparate Villages, tho' &s;ome of them now join, <HI>viz.</HI>

<P>All the&s;e, though &s;ome of them are very large Villages, make up but one Pari&s;h, and are within a few Years &s;o increa&s;ed in Buildings, and &s;o well in|habited, that there is no Compari&s;on to be made
<PB N="155" REF="156">
between their pre&s;ent and former State; every &s;epa|rate Hamlet being increa&s;ed, and &s;ome of them more than trebly bigger than formerly they were.</P>
<P><HI>Hackney</HI> is &s;o remarkable for the Retreat of wealthy Citizens, that there are at this time near an Hundred Coaches kept in it.</P>
<P><HI>Newington, Tottenham, Edmonton,</HI> and <HI>Enfield,</HI> &s;tand all in a Line North from the City. The Increa&s;e of Buildings is &s;o great in them all, that they &s;eem to a Traveller to be one continu'd Street; e&s;pecially <HI>Tottenham</HI> and <HI>Edmonton</HI>; and in them all, the new Buildings &s;o far exceed the old, e&s;pecially in their Value, and the Figure of the Inhabitants, that the Fa&s;hion of the Town is quite altered.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tottenham</HI> we &s;ee the Remains of an antient Building call'd the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> from which the Town takes the Name of <HI>High-Cro&s;s.</HI> Here is a &s;mall, but plea&s;ant Seat of the Earl of <HI>Colerain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Highgate</HI> and <HI>Ham&s;tead</HI> are next on the North-&s;ide. At the fir&s;t is a very beautiful Hou&s;e built by the late Sir <HI>William A&s;hur&s;t,</HI> on the very Summit of the Hill, and with a View from the very lowe&s;t Windows over the whole Vale, to the City: and that &s;o eminently, that they &s;ee the Ships pa&s;&s;ing up and down the River, for Twelve or Fifteen Miles below <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>As the County does not extend far this way, I take no notice of &s;maller Towns; nor is there any thing of Note but Citizens Hou&s;es for &s;everal Miles; except the Chace, at <HI>Enfield,</HI> which was a very beau|tiful Place, when King <HI>James</HI> I. re&s;ided at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> for the Plea&s;ure of his Hunting; and was then very full of Deer, and all &s;orts of Game; but it has &s;uf|fered &s;everal Depredations &s;ince that, and particu|larly in the Times of U&s;urpation, when it was &s;tript both of Game and Timber, and let out in Farms to Tenants for the U&s;e of the Publick.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157">After the Re&s;toration it was laid open again; Woods and Groves were every-where planted, and the whole Chace &s;tored with Deer: but it is not, nor perhaps ever will be, what it was.</P>
<P><HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> is ri&s;en from a little Village, almo&s;t to a City; nor could the uneven Surface, inconvenient for Building, check the Humour of the Builders; for even on the very Steep of the Hill, where there's no walking Twenty Yards together, without tug|ing up, or &s;traddling down a Hill, the Buildings are increa&s;ed to that Degree, that the Town almo&s;t &s;preads the whole Side of the Hill.</P>
<P>The Heath extends about a Mile every way, and affords a mo&s;t beautiful Pro&s;pect; for we &s;ee here <HI>Han&s;lop Steeple</HI> one way, which is within Eight Miles of <HI>Northampton,</HI> N. W. to <HI>Landown-hill</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> another way Ea&s;t, at lea&s;t Sixty-&s;ix Miles from one another. The Pro&s;pect to <HI>London,</HI> and beyond it to <HI>Ban&s;tead-downs,</HI> South; <HI>Shooters-hill,</HI> South-ea&s;t; <HI>Red-hill,</HI> South-we&s;t, and <HI>Wind&s;or-Ca&s;tle,</HI> We&s;t, is al&s;o uninterrupted. Indeed, due North, we &s;ee no farther than to <HI>Barnet,</HI> which is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ove Six Miles from it.</P>
<P>At the Foot of this Hill is an old Seat of the Earls of <HI>Che&s;terfield,</HI> called <HI>Bel-&s;ize</HI>; which for many Years had been neglected: but being tenanted by a certain <HI>Projector,</HI> who knew by what Handle to take the gay Part of the World, he made it a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure and Entertainment: this brought a wonder|ful Concour&s;e of People to the Place; and they were effectually gratified in all Sorts of Diver&s;ion; but there being too great a Licence u&s;ed, it alarm'd the Magi&s;trates, and now the Hou&s;e is ha&s;tening apace to Ruin.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Long Room at <HI>Hamp&s;tead,</HI> in which the Company meet publickly on a <HI>Monday</HI> Evening to play at Cards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mr. <HI>Vipand,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of that, built in the Year 1735, a fine A&s;&s;embly-room,
<PB N="157" REF="158">
Sixty Feet long, and Thirty wide, elegantly deco|rated; every one who does not &s;ub&s;cribe, pays half a Crown for Admittance. Every Gentleman who &s;ub&s;cribes a Guinea for the Sea&s;on, has a Ticket for him&s;elf, and for Two Ladies. Gentlemen and La|dies, who lodge in the Town, are entertain'd every <HI>Sunday</HI> for 6<HI>d.</HI> each, with Tea and Coffee; but no other Amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>I could not be at <HI>Ham&s;tead</HI> without making an Excur&s;ion to <HI>Edgworth,</HI> a little Market-town, on the Road to <HI>St. Albans</HI>; for 'tis certain, that this was formerly the main Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s, being the famous high Road, call'd <HI>Wat|ling-&s;treet,</HI> which reached from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Shrews|bury,</HI> and on towards <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Near this Town, the Duke of <HI>Chandos</HI> has built one of the mo&s;t magnificent Palaces in <HI>England,</HI> with a Profu&s;ion of Expence, and &s;o well furni&s;h'd within, that it has hardly its Equal in <HI>England.</HI> The Plai&s;tering and Gilding are done by the famous <HI>Pargotti,</HI> an <HI>Italian.</HI> The great <HI>Salon</HI> or <HI>Hall</HI> is painted by <HI>Paolucci.</HI> The Pillars &s;upporting the Building are all of Marble: the great Stair-ca&s;e is extremely fine; and the Steps are all of Marble, every Step being of one whole Piece, about Twenty-two Feet in Length.</P>
<P>The Avenue is &s;pacious and maje&s;tick, and as it gives you the View of Two Fronts, join'd, as it were, in one, the Di&s;tance not admitting you to &s;ee the Angle, which is in the Centre; &s;o you are agreeably drawn in, to think the Front of the Hou&s;e almo&s;t twice as large as it is.</P>
<P>And yet, when you come nearer, you are again &s;urpri&s;ed, by &s;eeing the winding Pa&s;&s;age opening, as it were, a new Front to the Eye, of near 120 Feet wide, which you had not &s;een before; &s;o that you are lo&s;t a while in looking near hand for what you &s;o evidently &s;aw a great way off.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">The Gardens are well de&s;igned, and have a va&s;t Variety, and the Canals are very large and noble.</P>
<P>The Chapel is a Singularity, both in its Building, and the Beauty of its Workman&s;hip; and the Duke u&s;ed to maintain there a full Choir, and had the Wor&s;hip perform'd with the be&s;t Mu&s;ick, after the manner of the Chapel Royal.</P>
<P>Two Miles from hence, we go up a &s;maller A&s;cent by the great Road; when leaving the Street Way on the Right, we enter a &s;pacious Common called <HI>Bu&s;hy-heath,</HI> where again we have a very agreeable Pro&s;pect. On the Right-hand, we have in View the Town of <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s; and all the Spaces between, and further beyond it, look like a Garden. The inclo&s;ed Corn-fields make one grand Parterre: the thick-planted Hedge-rows &s;eem like a Wilderne&s;s or Labyrinth; the Villages inter&s;pers'd, look like &s;o many &s;everal noble Seats of Gentlemen at a Di|&s;tance. In a Word, it is all Nature, and yet looks like Art. On the Left-hand we &s;ee the We&s;t-end of <HI>London, We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey,</HI> and the Parliament-Hou&s;e; but the Body of the City is cut off by the Hill, at which <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> intercepted the Sight on that Side. More to the South we have <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and S. W. <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and between both, tho&s;e beautiful Parts of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> on the Bank of the <HI>Thames,</HI> which are the mo&s;t agreeable in the World. But I mu&s;t travel no farther this Way, till I have taken a Journey We&s;t from <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and &s;een what the Country affords that Way.</P>
<P>The next Towns adjacent to <HI>London,</HI> are <HI>Ken|&s;ington, Chel&s;ea, Hamer&s;mith, Fulham, Brentford, Twickenham,</HI> &amp;c. all of them near, or adjoining to the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and which, by the Beauty of their Buildings, make good the North Shore of the River, an&s;werable to what I have already de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160">But here I ought not to omit mentioning the new Bridge from <HI>Fulham</HI> to <HI>Putney,</HI> cro&s;s the <HI>Thames,</HI> which is a hand&s;ome wooden Fabrick, and as con|venient, by its many angular Indentings, for Foot-pa&s;&s;engers, as for Hor&s;es and Coaches. A Toll is paid for every one that pa&s;&s;es it, let it be ever &s;o often in a Day; and the Rate pretty much the &s;ame as the Ferry u&s;ed to be. And as the Proprietors are &s;aid to divide 10 or 12<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> from the Profits of it, 'tis pity, methinks, that Foot-pa&s;&s;engers, who cannot wear the Bridge, &s;hould pay at all.</P>
<P><HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> cannot be nam'd without mentioning the King's Palace there: it was originally an old Hou&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI>'s, of whom the late King <HI>William</HI> bought it, and then inlarg'd it as we &s;ee; &s;ome of the old Building &s;till remaining in the Centre of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e it&s;elf fronts to the Garden Three Ways, the Gardens being now made exceeding fine, and inlarged to &s;uch a Degree, as to reach quite from the great Road in <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> Town, to the <HI>Action</HI> Road North, more than a Mile, be&s;ides a great Track of Ground out of <HI>Hyde-Park.</HI> An artificial Mount is al&s;o erected, which affords a fine View, is planted with Ever-greens, and has a Seat upon it, which turns round with great Ea&s;e at Plea&s;ure. The noble River that is lately dug in <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> affords a fine View from the&s;e beautiful Gardens. The fir&s;t laying out of the&s;e Gardens was the De&s;ign of the late Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who finding the Air agreed with the King, re&s;olved to make it agreeable to her&s;elf too, and gave the fir&s;t Orders for inlarging them.</P>
<P>The late Queen <HI>Anne</HI> improv'd what Queen <HI>Mary</HI> began, and delighted very much in the Place; and often was plea&s;ed to make the Green-hou&s;e, which is very beautiful, her Summer Supper-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Caroline</HI> completed the Whole, by the Additions ju&s;t now mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">King <HI>William,</HI> Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> dy'd here.</P>
<P>As this Palace opens to the We&s;t, there are Two great Wings built, for receiving &s;uch as nece&s;&s;ari|ly attend the Court, and a large Port-cocher at the Entrance, with a Po&s;tern, and a Stone Gallery, on the South-&s;ide of the Court, which leads to the great Stair-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It is no Wonder, the Court being &s;o much at <HI>Ken|&s;ington,</HI> that the Town has increa&s;ed in Buildings; and indeed it abounds with hand&s;ome Hou&s;es, and has a very pretty Square.</P>
<P>South of this Town &s;tands <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> at which Place is the noble&s;t Building, and one of the be&s;t Foundations of its kind in the World, for maimed and old Soldiers, built by Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren.</HI></P>
<P>Here al&s;o are the Phy&s;ick-gardens belonging to the Company of <HI>Apothecaries</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> In it is lately built a &s;tately and convenient Edifice, which &s;erves at the &s;ame time for a Green-hou&s;e, and Apart|ments over it for meeting of the Company of <HI>Apo|thecaries,</HI> &amp;c. and over them are very convenient Apartments, which may be u&s;ed for drying Seeds of Plants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As this Ground was made a Pre&s;ent by Sir <HI>Hans Sloane,</HI> they have erected in the new Building, a Statue of that Gentleman; and intend to make, in due Time, an Opening down to the River, which will have a beautiful Effect upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> and receive no le&s;s Grace from it. On the Pede&s;tal of this Statue is an In&s;cription expre&s;&s;ing the Company's Gratitude to Sir <HI>Hans.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Royal Ho&s;pital was, till very lately, a neat and beautiful Hou&s;e and Gardens built by the late Earl of <HI>Ranelagh</HI>; but they are now quite de|&s;troyed, being &s;old out in Parcels to Builders, and other Purcha&s;ers.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Walpole</HI> has a fine Hou&s;e here, and good Gardens, adjoining to the Ho&s;pital, adorn'd with noble Pictures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">In &s;hort there is an incredible Number of fine Hou&s;es built in all the&s;e Towns within the&s;e few Years, which in other Places would pa&s;s, in a man|ner, for Palaces; and mo&s;t of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors whereof keep Coaches.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e are the late Lord <HI>Peterborough</HI>'s at <HI>Par&s;ons-Green</HI>; Lord <HI>Halifax</HI>'s at <HI>Bu&s;hy-Park</HI>; Earl of <HI>Bradford</HI>'s, Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>'s, Earl of <HI>Shrew&s;bury</HI>'s, Earl of <HI>Burlington</HI>'s, <HI>Sutton-Court Chi&s;wick,</HI> Mr. <HI>Barker</HI>'s, Lord <HI>Wilmington</HI>'s, Gene|ral <HI>Whetham</HI>'s, <HI>Holland-Hou&s;e,</HI> near <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> &s;ituated on a fine Eminence, and which now is taken by the Lord <HI>Bruce,</HI> who is making it once more a delightful Habitation; the late Secretary <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s, at <HI>Twickenham,</HI> and Multitudes of others.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over &s;o &s;lightly the noble Seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of <HI>Burlington,</HI> at <HI>Chi&s;|wick</HI>; and yet I can only mention cur&s;orily &s;ome of its Beauties: as the River his Lord&s;hip has dug in his Gardens, a very fine one indeed; from the Earth of which he has formed a noble Mount next the Road, or rather a Terrace, from which the whole Country may be viewed, and which &s;erves at the &s;ame time, for a Defence to his Gardens on that Side, and is planted to the Road with all manner of &s;weet Shrubs, Ro&s;es, Honey&s;uckles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that yield in the Sea&s;on a delightful Fragrance, as well to the Pa&s;&s;engers as to tho&s;e on the Terrace; the magnificent Buildings in Imitation of antient Temples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> inter&s;per&s;ed in the Gardens; the beautiful Bridge over the River in it; the fine Walks; the unbounded Pro&s;pects; &s;eve|ral curious Statues, a noble Obeli&s;k, delicate Vi&s;tas, and the &s;umptuous Buildings adjoining to the old Hou&s;e, commanding a fine View to the River; which, with the Pictures and valuable Curio&s;ities within&s;ide, altogether exceed De&s;cription.</P>
<P>In the Village of <HI>Hamer&s;mith,</HI> which was former|ly a long &s;cattering Place, full of Gardeners Grounds,
<PB N="162" REF="163">
with here and there an old Hou&s;e of &s;ome Bulk, we &s;ee now great Numbers of fine Hou&s;es, and a continued Range of a great Length, which makes the main Street.</P>
<P>I have now travers'd the be&s;t Part of <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> a County made rich, plea&s;ant and populous, by the Neighbourhood of <HI>London.</HI> The Borders of the County have Three Market-towns, <HI>Stanes, Colbrook</HI> and <HI>Uxbridge:</HI> this la&s;t is a plea&s;ant large Town, full of good Inns, as the others are, and famous, in particular, for having abundance of fine Seats of Gentlemen, and Per&s;ons of Quality, in the Neigh|bourhood; and al&s;o for a vain Attempt made in the great Civil War, to &s;ettle the Peace of the&s;e Na|tions by a Treaty here. I &s;hould never have done, were I to pretend to de&s;cribe, tho' ever &s;o &s;lightly, the large Towns on both Sides the River; as

where a new Church is ju&s;t fini&s;h'd; and others all crouded and &s;urrounded with fine Hou&s;es, or rather Palaces, of the Nobility, Quality and Gentry of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There are but Three more Market-towns in the County, <HI>viz. Brentford,</HI> the County-town, <HI>Edg|worth,</HI> and <HI>Enfield.</HI></P>
<P>And now I enter the County of <HI>Hertford,</HI> a fruitful Soil, as it is managed; for 'tis certain, it is more indebted, for its Fertility, to the Sagacity and Indu&s;try of the Hu&s;bandman, than to Nature. Rich Meadows are &s;eldom found here; for it affords not any large Rivers: the Arable hath generally too much Gravel, or too much Clay; but the&s;e la&s;t cold
<PB N="163" REF="164">
and wet Lands have been within the&s;e Forty Years greatly improv'd by draining off the Rain-water, which &s;tagnated on the clayey Surface, as in a Cup, and chilled the Roots of the Corn; an Invention, called <HI>Bu&s;h-draining.</HI></P>
<P>The County is well-water'd for the Conveniency of the Inhabitants; tho' the <HI>Lea</HI> is the only navigable Stream in it, which has its Ri&s;e in <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI>; of which more anon. But this County a&s;&s;umes the Honour of giving Ri&s;e unto &s;everal Rivers, <HI>viz.</HI> the Pari&s;h of <HI>Tring</HI> to the <HI>Thames,</HI> which leaving the County at <HI>Putenham,</HI> goes by <HI>Ayle&s;hury</HI> to <HI>Thame,</HI> and thence by <HI>Wheatley-bridge</HI> to <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> and falls into the <HI>I&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>The County may be divided into Three Parts pretty equal, by Two great Roads, one Part lying between the North Road, which goes thro' <HI>Hert|ford</HI> to <HI>Nottingham,</HI> &amp;c. and the Borders of <HI>Cam|bridge&s;hire</HI> North, and tho&s;e of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Ea&s;t. Another Part lying between that Road and the other, which leads thro' <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s to <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>; and the third lying between this la&s;t Road, and the Bor|ders of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> South, and tho&s;e of <HI>Bucks</HI> We&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the la&s;t at <HI>Ea&s;t-Barnet,</HI> a Thoroughfare-town of Note, and well &s;upplied with Inns: it lies high and plea&s;ant, and was formerly frequented for its medicinal Waters, and now for its Swine-market. It has in its Neighbourhood &s;everal very hand&s;ome Hou&s;es of the <HI>Londoners,</HI> and which are the more plea&s;ant by being &s;o near the Chace.</P>
<P><HI>Totteridge</HI> is near it al&s;o, and is a very plea&s;ant Village. It is &s;ituated on a fine Eminence looking to the North, over the <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s Road into the Fore&s;t; and on the South over the <HI>Edgware</HI> Road, to <HI>Har|row,</HI> &amp;c. It is very clean, and has &s;everal very good Hou&s;es in it. The Road from <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> here is extremely plea&s;ant, and &s;o well repaired, that in the wor&s;t Sea&s;on there is &s;carce any Water or Dirt
<PB N="164" REF="165">
remaining in it; and as it lies not on any great Road, there are no heavy Carriages pa&s;&s;ing that Way; therefore a &s;mall Expence annually, well laid out, will always keep this Road in excellent Repair.</P>
<P><HI>Cheaping-Barnet</HI> lies a little North, in the <HI>St. Al|ban</HI>'s Road, and is remarkable for the deci&s;ive Battle fought there on <HI>Ea&s;ter-day</HI> 1468, between the Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> in which the great Earl of <HI>War|wick,</HI> &s;tyled <HI>Make-king,</HI> was killed, with many of the prime Nobility, and 10,000 Men. The Place &s;up|po&s;ed to be the Field of Battle, is a green Spot near <HI>Kicks-End,</HI> between <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s and <HI>Hatfield</HI> Roads, a little before they meet. The Manor is in the Property of the Duke of <HI>Chandois.</HI> A hand&s;ome Row of Six Alms-hou&s;es, for &s;o many Widows, founded by <HI>James Raven&s;croft,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in 1672, with a little Furniture to each, is in the Street. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> built a Free School-hou&s;e of Brick in the &s;ame Street, where Nine Children are taught <HI>gratis,</HI> and all other Boys at Five Shillings the Quarter.</P>
<P>About Two Miles N. W. from hence, on the Left-hand, lies <HI>Durhams,</HI> formerly the Seat of the <HI>Au&s;tins,</HI> but is now the Property of the Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> who purcha&s;ed it of Sir <HI>John Au&s;tin,</HI> and has &s;ince greatly beautified the Seat, by laying mo&s;t of the neighbouring Fields belonging to the E&s;tate, into a Park, and turning and repairing of the Roads. The Hou&s;e &s;tands on an Eminence, &s;ituated in a &s;mall Valley, &s;urrounded with pretty high Hills at a little Di&s;tance, &s;o that in the Summer Months it is an agreeable Retirement: but the Soil all round it being a &s;trong Clay, all the Rain which falls in Win|ter being detained on the Surface, renders the Situa|tion very cold and moi&s;t. Add to this the Want of good Water, and Timber near the Hou&s;e, (except the young Trees which have been planted by his Lord&s;hip) and upon the Whole it cannot be e&s;teemed a good Seat.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166"><HI>Idle&s;trey</HI> or <HI>El&s;tre</HI> is a Village on the <HI>Roman Wat|ling-&s;treet,</HI> on the very Edge of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI>; but it is chiefly noted for its Situation, near <HI>Brockly-Hill,</HI> by <HI>Stanmore,</HI> which affords a lovely View cro&s;s <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> over the <HI>Thames,</HI> into <HI>Surrey.</HI> Near this is <HI>Kendale</HI> Wood, where formerly was found an old Flint Wall, &s;o hard as not to yield to the Strokes of the Pick-ax; as likewi&s;e an Oven.

<P><HI>Pennywel</HI> is a Parcel of Clo&s;es acro&s;s the Valley beyond <HI>Brockley-Hill,</HI> where Foundations are di&s;|cernible, and where, they &s;ay, has been a City.</P>
<P>About Two Miles further We&s;t lies <HI>Watford,</HI> a Market-town, Seventeen Miles from <HI>London,</HI> upon the <HI>Colne,</HI> where it hath Two Streams, which run &s;eparately to <HI>Rickmer&s;worth.</HI> Several Alms-hou&s;es belong to this Town, and an hand&s;ome Free-&s;chool, built in 1704, and fini&s;h'd 1709, by <HI>Elizabeth Fuller,</HI> Widow; and in the Church are &s;everal hand&s;ome Monuments. The Town is very long, having but one Street, which is the publick, and &s;o is extreme|ly dirty in Winter; and the Waters of the River, at the Entrance of the Town, are often &s;o much &s;welled by Floods, as to be unpa&s;&s;able; and the Bridge de&s;igned as the Road at &s;uch times, is &s;o much out of Repair, that it is very dangerous for any Carriages of Burthen to pa&s;s over it; which is a very great Di&s;advantage to the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;&s;ioberry,</HI> the Seat of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> is the next thing that occurs worth notice, and is elegant. The Situation is the be&s;t in the County, upon a dry Spot, within a Park of a large Extent: the
<PB N="166" REF="167">
Hou&s;e is built in Form of an H: the Middle and the Ea&s;t Wing is modern, and in good Repair; but the We&s;t Wing is very old, and by no means cor|re&s;ponding with the other Parts of the Hou&s;e. The Front faces the South-ea&s;t, and looks directly on the Hou&s;e in <HI>Moore-Park,</HI> on which the late Mr. <HI>Stiles</HI> expended &s;uch great Sums of Money, and which has a noble Look from <HI>Ca&s;&s;ioberry</HI> Hou&s;e. In the Front of the Hou&s;e is a fine dry Lawn of Gra&s;s, which immediately after the heavie&s;t Winter Rains may be rode or walked on, as on the drie&s;t Downs; and a little below the Hou&s;e is a River, which winds through the Park, and in the drie&s;t Sea&s;ons con&s;tantly runs with a fine Stream, affording great Plenty of Trout, Cray-fi&s;h, and indeed mo&s;t other kinds of fre&s;h-water Fi&s;h. On the North and Ea&s;t Sides of the Hou&s;e are large Wood-walks, which were planted by the famous <HI>Le Notre,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. The Woods have many large Beech and Oak-trees in them; but the principal Walks are planted with Lime-trees, and the&s;e are mo&s;t of them too narrow for their Length, and too regular for the modern Ta&s;te. On the other Side of the River, the Ground ri&s;es to a con&s;iderable Height, which affords an agreeable Variety; part of which being covered with &s;tately Woods, appearing at a proper Di&s;tance from the Front of the Hou&s;e, have a fine Effect to the Eye. In &s;hort, the whole Spot (if a &s;mall Expence was be&s;tow'd to improve and put it more in the modern Ta&s;te) would be one of the fine&s;t Places near <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Near <HI>Ca&s;&s;ioberry</HI> is a plea&s;ant Seat, purcha&s;ed by the late Lord <HI>Raymond,</HI> called <HI>Langleybury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rickmer&s;worth</HI> is a Market-town, within Three or Four Miles We&s;t of <HI>Watford.</HI> It gave Birth to Sir <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Merchant-Taylor of <HI>London,</HI> who founded <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> Hall, and <HI>St. John</HI>'s Col|lege

<P><HI>Abbots-Langley,</HI> Twenty-two Miles from <HI>London,</HI> &s;ituated about Three Miles North of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ioberry,</HI> in a good Air and Soil, is remarkable for the Birth of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pope, <HI>Nicolas Brake&s;pear,</HI> by the Title of <HI>Adrian</HI> IV. The Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> held his Stirrup, while he di&s;mounted. He was choaked, as &s;ome &s;ay, by a Fi&s;h, and, as others, by a Quin&s;y: but it is an indelible Stain on his Memory, that, when &s;overeign Pontiff, he &s;uffer'd his Mother to be main|tain'd by the Alms of the Church of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>We proceeded to <HI>Kings-Langley,</HI> &s;o called, be|cau&s;e <HI>Henry</HI> III. built him&s;elf a Royal Hou&s;e here, of which the Ruins &s;till exi&s;t: and here was born and buried <HI>Edmund de Langley,</HI> Duke of <HI>York,</HI> Fifth Son of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and his Wife <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> younge&s;t Daughter of Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> King of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> was al&s;o buried here, and the Tomb is in the Church of this Place.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">We next went to <HI>Hemp&s;ted,</HI> a little further North, and about Twenty-three Miles from <HI>London,</HI> a Baili|wick Corporate Town.

Eleven Pair of Mills &s;tand within Four Miles of the Place, which bring a great Trade to it: but the Road is by this means &s;o continually torn, that it is one of the wor&s;t Turnpikes round about <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>A little North of <HI>Hemp&s;ted</HI> we turn'd We&s;t, and came to <HI>Great Barkham&s;ted,</HI> about Twenty-four computed Miles from <HI>London.</HI> It is a very antient Town, which for many Hundred of Years has been one of the Crown Manors, which granted to it many very ample Privileges. It is now annexed to the Dukedom of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and as &s;uch appro|priated to the Princes of <HI>Wales.</HI> The Ca&s;tle and Manor are at pre&s;ent held by Lea&s;e from the Prince, by <HI>Edward Carey,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which was obtained by his Ance&s;tors of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Barkham&s;ted</HI> has evidently been a <HI>Roman</HI> Town, by the Name of <HI>Durobrivae</HI>; and probably the Ca&s;tle &s;tands upon a <HI>Roman</HI> Foundation. <HI>Roman</HI> Coins are frequently dug up there. It is mo&s;t plea|&s;antly inviron'd with high and hard Ground, full of Hedge-rows, Pa&s;tures, and Arable, tho' &s;ituated upon a South-&s;ide of a Mar&s;h. It extends it&s;elf far in hand&s;ome Buildings, and a broad Street In the Time of the Heptarchy it was the Re&s;idence of the Kings of <HI>Mercia</HI>; and here <HI>Wightred</HI> King of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Mercia,</HI> in the Year 69, held a Parliament: here al&s;o King <HI>Ina</HI>'s Laws were publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle was judiciou&s;ly &s;et on the North-&s;ide of the Town, on dry Ground, among&s;t Springs, and made exceedingly &s;trong by the <HI>Saxons.</HI> It was rebuilt by <HI>Moreton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> Brother to <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> and razed for Rebellion in his

Son's Time, and &s;o with the Manor fell to the Crown. <HI>Henry</HI> II. kept his Court here, and granted great Privileges to the Place.

<P>When the Ca&s;tle was demoli&s;h'd, a large Hou&s;e was built out of its Ruins, which is beautifully &s;ituated. What now remains of it is but the third Part, and the Back of the great Hou&s;e; for the other two Thirds were de&s;troyed by Fire in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. It was in King <HI>James</HI>'s Time a Nur&s;ery for that Prince's Children; and Prince <HI>Henry</HI> and Prince <HI>Charles</HI> were bred up there; and in the Time of the late Troubles, Colonel <HI>Axtel,</HI> a Parliament Officer, held it. It is now in the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Roper</HI> Family.</P>
<P>The Corporation &s;unk in the War between the King and Parliament. In King <HI>Charles</HI> II.'s Time an Attempt was made to revive the Charter; but it was dropt. This Body Politick is now reduced to a Skeleton, like the Ca&s;tle, which is only to be known by its Moats and Walls.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle contains within its fir&s;t Moat, Four or Five Acres. There is again a Divi&s;ion by another Moat. The South Part, con&s;i&s;ting of about Two Acres, is upon a Level with mo&s;t of the outward Walls and Chimneys remaining. Towards the North, acro&s;s a Moat, is a high Hill or Keep, capable of defending it&s;elf again&s;t the former, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an Enemy. The Traces of the Bridge of Com|munication, and the Moat dividing the&s;e Two Places of Strength, are continued to the grand one, that takes in the whole Scite of the Fortification. The Remains of the Bridge for Entrance from the Town,

are vi&s;ible, an&s;wering exactly to the other, as the North of the fir&s;t Area, which led to the Hills.</P>
<P>In this Town was the famous Interview between <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, in his March towards <HI>London,</HI> after his Victory over <HI>Harold.</HI> He pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Wallingford,</HI> and was going forward to <HI>St. Albans,</HI> when the &s;tout Abbot <HI>Frederick</HI> &s;topp'd his March by Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till he could get the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility together, and then he made him &s;wear to keep inviolably the good and antient Laws of the Kingdom; yet he took away all their Lands, and divided them among his hungry <HI>Normans.</HI></P>
<P>This Town gives Name to the Deanry. The Church is hand&s;ome, dedicated to St. <HI>Peter</HI>; it has had many Chapels and Oratories. On the Pillars of the Church are the Eleven Apo&s;tles, with each of them a Sentence of the Creed, and St. <HI>George</HI> killing a Dragon, on the Twelfth. The&s;e were whited over by the Zeal of the late Times, and are but lately come to Light.</P>
<P>The Chapel of <HI>St. John</HI> is u&s;ed only by the Ma|&s;ter, U&s;hers and Scholars of the Free-School. <HI>St. Leonard</HI>'s Ho&s;pital was at the South-ea&s;t End of the High-&s;treet, and <HI>St. James</HI>'s Ho&s;pital at the other End. The Free Grammar-School was built by Dean <HI>Incent,</HI> of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s. It is a hand&s;ome Brick Structure, with an Apartment at one End for the Ma&s;ter, at the other for the U&s;her and Chantry-Clerk. It was Twenty Years in Building.</P>

Both Church and Chancel are paved with Free-Stone; the Pillars are painted; the Pulpit and &s;ounding Board are of fine Inlaid-work; and a hand&s;ome Ve&s;try is under the Belfry.</P>
<P>Among other Monuments is a magnificent one for Sir <HI>William Gore</HI> and his Lady; with In&s;cri|ptions to their Honour, but too long for a Place here.</P>
<P>From <HI>Tring</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed next Ea&s;tward, and came to <HI>Gade&s;den-Little</HI>; where I had heard was a fine Pro&s;pect; and I wanted not Curio&s;ity to &s;ee it.

The Pro&s;pect I mean is from one Part of this Pari&s;h, to which a Common of fine Turf leads under the Duke of <HI>Bridgwater</HI>'s &s;hady Park; and a noble one it is of Three Counties, worthy of the Pencil of the greate&s;t Arti&s;t in Land&s;chape.</P>
<P>The Variety of Woods, Cliffs, Arable and Pa|&s;ture, are charming; but they mu&s;t be tempted to half a Mile's plea&s;ant Exerci&s;e to get to the beautiful Scene.</P>
<P><HI>Cawley-Wood</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> is a &s;mall Covert, a Mile from hence, at the Top of a Hill, in <HI>Bucks,</HI> one of the greate&s;t Land-marks in the South of <HI>England,</HI> which overlooks Eleven Counties.

<P>The Manor of <HI>Aldbury</HI> lies North-ea&s;t of <HI>Tring,</HI> and in the Way to <HI>Gade&s;den.</HI> It belongs to the Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> who&s;e Father married the Heire&s;s of the Family of <HI>Hyde</HI>; and &s;o does <HI>Muniborough-Hill</HI> lie in the Way from <HI>Aldbury</HI> to <HI>Little-Gade&s;den,</HI> and affords a hand&s;ome Pro&s;pect.</P>

<P><HI>Gade&s;den</HI> is famous for the Birth of <HI>John de Ga|de&s;den,</HI> who flouri&s;hed in the Beginning of the Fourteenth Century; the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> who was a Court Phy&s;ician, and of who&s;e Skill <HI>Chaucer</HI> makes honourable mention, in his <HI>Doctor of Phy&s;ick,</HI> pre|fix'd to his <HI>Canterbury Tales</HI>; though Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> from <HI>John</HI>'s own Books, will not allow him to de|&s;erve it.

<P>I cro&s;s'd over a Slip (as I may call it) of <HI>Bucks,</HI> which runs into <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> between <HI>Aldbury</HI> and <HI>Ken&s;worth-Green,</HI> which lies a little South of the Road which leads from <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s to <HI>Dun&s;table,</HI> and is a Situation &s;urpri&s;ingly fine, about half a Mile in Length, a good Turf, and level with <HI>Whip&s;nape-Woods</HI> on the Back of it, and Rows of high Trees on the other Side. Nothing but Sky is to be &s;een from it one Way, and the other we have only a View of the Top of a Grove, at <HI>Market-Cell.</HI> It &s;eems to claim a Preference of every Place in the County for a Cell, yet never had one on it: it comes very little &s;hort of the famous <HI>Guy</HI>'s Cliff, near <HI>Warwick.</HI> There the &s;hady Grove, and rol|ling Stream below it, make a beautiful Scene for So|litude: here the Woods and Trees afford Shade enough, and the pure circumambient Ether, with nothing in View but the Tops of Trees, would make a Hermit think him&s;elf in another World.</P>
<P>Here I came into the Road, and &s;o turned South-ea&s;t for <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s, thro' <HI>Flam&s;tead</HI> Pari&s;h, where is a well-built and delightful Seat of Sir <HI>Thomas-Saunders Sebright,</HI> Bart. on a ri&s;ing Ground in the middle of a Park. It is called <HI>Beechwood</HI> Manor, from the great Number of fine Beech-trees which were formerly growing here, &s;ome of which are yet remaining on the Sides of the Park. The Soil of this Park is, for the mo&s;t part, dry, the Surface being &s;hallow, on a &s;trong or chalky Bot|tom, which renders the Turf very fine and &s;hort, and very plea&s;ant for the Exerci&s;e of either riding or walking. It was formerly a Nunnery for a Priore&s;s and Ten Nuns, independent of any other Convent, and then called <HI>St. Gyles in the Wood.</HI> A very &s;erious In&s;cription in <HI>Flam&s;tead</HI> Church, on a Monument of one of the <HI>Saunders</HI> Family, may

<P>Pur&s;uing &s;till the &s;ame Cour&s;e along the great Road, we came next to <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s, the capital Town of <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> famous for deriving its Name from the Proto-martyr of <HI>England,</HI> who &s;uf|fered &s;o early in the fourth Century. 'Tis governed by a Mayor, 10 Burge&s;&s;es, a Steward and a Cham|berlain, and is a peculiar Liberty both for Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal and Civil Government.</P>
<P>The Town ro&s;e out of the Ruins of old <HI>Verulam</HI>; of which &s;o much has been &s;aid by Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> and others, that we refer to them for Particulars. In that great Man's Time, the Ruins afforded much more for the Ob&s;ervation of the Curious than now; for they are &s;ince dug away, for mending the High|ways. The fir&s;t <HI>Verulam</HI> was &s;tormed and taken by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> And here <HI>Ca&s;&s;ibelan,</HI> a famous <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King, then kept his Court. The fir&s;t De&s;truction of the Place is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been by <HI>Boadicea,</HI> the famous <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Queen, who cut off 70000 <HI>Romans</HI> in one Battle; and the &s;econd, (which was erected on the Ruins of the other) in the Wars between the <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI>; and al|mo&s;t
<PB N="175" REF="176">
infinite are the Numbers of Antiquities here dug up.</P>
<P>The Origin of <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s was owing to the Mona&s;tery built by <HI>Offa,</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> to the Memory of St. <HI>Alban,</HI> in Expiation of his bar|barous Murder of <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> King of <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles,</HI> whom he had treacherou&s;ly inveigled to his Court, on Pretence of marrying his Daughter; and the &s;ame <HI>Offa</HI> it was that built <HI>Hertford</HI> Cathedral, and dedicated it to <HI>St. Ethelbert,</HI> and made a Journey to <HI>Rome</HI> as further Penance, where he was ab&s;olved, tho' he kept the murder'd Prince's Dominions, and joined them to his own.</P>
<P>Of all the Mona&s;teries in <HI>England,</HI> none could out&s;hine this. Its Revenue was great, and its Pri|vileges &s;till greater. In the Royalties it had from its Founder, and the Epi&s;copal Powers from the Pope, none came up to it. The mitred Abbot had Precedency of all in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ubject to no Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power but the Pope immediately; and he had Epi&s;copal Juri&s;diction over both Clergy and Laity in all the Lands belonging to his Mona&s;tery. From fir&s;t to la&s;t they were Forty-one in Number, and many of them Per&s;ons of great Ac|compli&s;hments, and high Birth: the 39th of which, tho' not high-born, was Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey.</HI> The la&s;t Abbot was <HI>Richard Boreman,</HI> who at the Di&s;&s;olu|tion quietly &s;urrendred on the Royal Command, and accepted of a Pen&s;ion for Life, of 266<HI>l.</HI> 13<HI>s.</HI> and 4<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Two bloody Battles were fought near this Place, between the Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI>; the fir&s;t upon the 23d of <HI>May</HI> 1455, in which the <HI>Yorki&s;ts</HI> got the Day; the &s;econd on <HI>Shrove-Tue&s;day,</HI> in the 39th of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. when the martial Queen <HI>Margaret</HI> overcame the <HI>Yorki&s;ts,</HI> who had then the King in their Power, and fought under the Sanction of his Name.</P>

<P>We come now to <HI>Hertford,</HI> the County Town, 20 computed Miles from <HI>London</HI>; a Corporation, governed by a Mayor and Burge&s;&s;es. It is plea&s;antly &s;ituated in a whol&s;ome Air, and a dry Vale, having a good weekly Market well &s;tored with Corn, and all &s;ort of Provi&s;ions.

Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Powell</HI> got a Reprieve for the poor Creature, after the Jury had found her guilty, contrary to his Directions. She lived &s;everal Years afterwards on an Allowance from the Pari&s;h. The poor Wretch had been frighted into a Confe&s;&s;ion, that &s;he was a Witch; and thereupon was committed by Sir <HI>Harry Chauncy,</HI> of <HI>Yardlybury,</HI> who would fain have had her retract, and pacify her Accu&s;ers.

The Church &s;tands in the Middle of the Town; it is a hand&s;ome high-built Edifice, with a Ring of Six good Bells. It has Three Chancels, but the Two outward are rather Chapels. The <HI>Ikening-&s;treet,</HI> about <HI>Baldock</HI> now appears but like a Field-way. Between <HI>Baldock</HI> and <HI>Icleford</HI> it goes thro' an In|trenchment, con&s;i&s;ting of the Remains of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Town, now called <HI>Wilbury-hill. Icleford</HI> retains the Name of the Street, which at this Place pa&s;&s;es a Rivulet with a &s;trong Ford, wanting Reparation.</P>
<P>This Street, quite to the <HI>Thames</HI> in <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> goes at the Bottom of a continued Ridge of Hills, called the <HI>Chiltern,</HI> being Chalk, and the natural and civil Boundary between the Counties of <HI>Hertford</HI> and <HI>Bedford,</HI> very &s;teep Northward.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Ikening-&s;treet</HI> and the <HI>Fo&s;s</HI> traver&s;ed the Kingdom from South-we&s;t to North-ea&s;t, parallel to each other, and <HI>Watling-&s;treet</HI> cro&s;&s;ed the&s;e quite the contrary Way with an equal Obliquity, the <HI>Herman-&s;treet</HI> pa&s;&s;ed directly North and South. This Word is <HI>Saxon,</HI> and &s;ignifies a Soldier or Warrior, which Name it obtained from being a Military Way.</P>
<P>It begins at <HI>Newhaven,</HI> at the Mouth of the River <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and pa&s;&s;es on the We&s;t Side of that River, thro' <HI>Radmil,</HI> then thro' <HI>Lewis</HI> by <HI>Isfield</HI>; after which it &s;eems to pa&s;s over the River at <HI>Sharn|bridge,</HI> and &s;o proceeds to <HI>Ea&s;t Grin&s;tead</HI>; but is lo&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing thro' the great Woods. Then thro' <HI>Surry</HI> it goes by <HI>Stane-&s;treet, Croydon, Stretham,</HI> and by its pointing we may conclude was originally de&s;igned to pa&s;s the <HI>Thames</HI> at the Ferry called <HI>Stan|gate</HI> by <HI>Lambeth,</HI> where it coincides with the <HI>Watling-&s;treet.</HI> There the Road went, before <HI>London</HI> became con&s;iderable: but &s;ince that Period the Traces of the Roads near that Capital have grown very ob&s;cure. The original Road perhaps pa&s;&s;es thro' unfrequented Ways near <HI>Enfield,</HI> and <HI>Harman-&s;treet,</HI> which &s;eems from thence to have borrowed its Name.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="190">On the Ea&s;tern Side of <HI>Enfield</HI> Chace by <HI>Bu&s;h-hill,</HI> is a circular <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Camp upon an Eminence, de|clining South-we&s;t. But the antient Road appears upon a Common on this Side <HI>Hertford</HI> by <HI>Ball's-park,</HI> and pa&s;&s;es the River below <HI>Hertford</HI>; then, goes thro' <HI>Ware-park,</HI> and falls into the pre&s;ent Road on this Side <HI>Buntingford,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Roy&s;ton,</HI> where it cro&s;&s;es the <HI>Ikening-&s;treet,</HI> coming from <HI>Tring</HI> thro' <HI>Dun&s;table,</HI> going into <HI>Suffolk.</HI> The&s;e are the principal Places upon the Two Roads, which we thought fit to mention together.</P>
<P>At <HI>Baldock</HI> I cro&s;&s;ed the North Road, and got into the Third Divi&s;ion I propo&s;ed, next <HI>Cambridge&s;hire</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; and when I have pa&s;&s;ed thro' it, I will return back again South, and take a View of &s;uch Towns as lie on the Ea&s;t Side of the middle Divi&s;ion as I have not been at already.</P>
<P>In the Year 1724, between <HI>Caldecot</HI> and <HI>Henx|worth,</HI> &s;everal <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities were dug up. Workmen, digging Gravel for the Repair of the great Northern Road, &s;truck upon &s;ome earthen Ve&s;&s;els or large Urns, full of A&s;hes and burnt Bones, but rotten; near them a human Skeleton, with the Head towards the South-ea&s;t, the Feet North-we&s;t. Several Bodies were found in the &s;ame Po&s;ition, not above a Foot under the Surface of the Earth, and with Urns, great or &s;mall, near them, and Patera's of fine red Earth, &s;ome with the Impre&s;&s;ion of the Maker at the Bottom; al&s;o Gla&s;s Lacrymatories, Ampulla's, a Bra&s;s Tribulus, Six &s;mall Gla&s;&s;es, Two large Beads of a Green Colour, and other Frag|ments.</P>
<P>I went thro' the Village of <HI>A&s;hwell,</HI> which &s;tands not far from <HI>Caldecot,</HI> on the Source of the <HI>Rhee,</HI> by the Borders of <HI>Cambridge&s;hire,</HI> which breaks out of a Rock here from many Springs, with &s;uch Force as to form a Stream remarkably clear, but &s;o cold, that it gripes Hor&s;es not u&s;ed to drink it.
<PB N="190" REF="191">
The Water here bubbles out at as many Places, and as abundantly, and in ju&s;t &s;uch a Bottom under a Hill, as doth the <HI>I&s;is</HI> or <HI>Thames</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire.</HI> In <HI>Dome&s;day Book</HI> this Village is called a Borough, having Fourteen Burge&s;&s;es, and a Market; antiently al&s;o it had Four Fairs. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> thinks the Village <HI>Roman</HI>; and at half a Mile Di&s;tance, South of this Source of the <HI>Rhee,</HI> is a Spot of Ground taken in by a Vallum, and generally thought to be one of the <HI>Ca&s;tra Exploratorum</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI>; it is called <HI>Arbury Banks,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ts of about 12 Acres, and <HI>Roman</HI> Coins have been found here; but &s;till it wants &s;everal Requi&s;ites, that go to a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, which I have not room to particularize. <HI>A&s;hwell-field</HI> affords a Stone Quarry, out of which the Stones of mo&s;t of the Churches of this Side, and the neighbouring Part of <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> have been dug. The Church has a hand&s;ome Chancel, Three large Ayles, a lofty Tower at the We&s;t End, with a Ring of Six Bells, and a Chapel on the North Side the Chancel.</P>
<P>I now come to <HI>Roy&s;ton,</HI> &s;ituated upon the utmo&s;t Northern Border of <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> in&s;omuch that Part of it is in <HI>Cambridge&s;hire,</HI> 33 computed Miles from <HI>London.</HI> The Fields about this Towns have upon almo&s;t every Eminence a Barrow, and they lie very thick by the <HI>Ikening-&s;treet,</HI> Ea&s;t of this Town. Here was a Mona&s;tery founded in Honour of St. <HI>Thomas &agrave; Becket,</HI> as al&s;o an Ho&s;pital, both &s;wallowed up in the Di&s;&s;olution of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. but the Priory-church was purcha&s;ed by the Inhabitants, and made a Pari&s;h-church of. It con&s;i&s;ts of a Nave, and an Ayle on each Side, and a &s;quare Tower with a Ring of Five Bells in it.</P>
<P>The Town became populous, on erecting the pre&s;ent Po&s;t-road through it, which before ran along the <HI>Ermine-&s;treet,</HI> thro' <HI>Barkw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">iggle&s;wade.</HI> It is now a good Town, and well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and has

a very great Corn-market on <HI>Wedne&s;days,</HI> and is full of good Inns. In the Year 1716, a School-hou&s;e was erected here by Contribution of the Town and Country.</P>
<P>Two Miles both Ways of <HI>Roy&s;ton</HI> is chalky Soil; about <HI>Puckeridge</HI> it is gravelly: in other Places adjoining are Camps, and <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities. At <HI>Had&s;tock</HI> is the Skin of a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> King nailed upon the Church Doors, as reported.</P>
<P><HI>Roy&s;ton</HI> was a <HI>Roman</HI> Town before <HI>Roi&s;ia</HI> built her religious Hou&s;e here; for <HI>Roman</HI> Coins have been dug up near the Spot. There &s;eems to be the Stamp of <HI>Roi&s;ia</HI>'s Cro&s;s &s;till remaining at the Corner of the Inn, ju&s;t where the Two Roads meet. The Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> digging Canals at <HI>Wimple,</HI> when he had that Seat, found many Bodies, and ru&s;ty Pieces of Iron, the Remains of &s;ome Battle.</P>
<P>And now I bend my Cour&s;e Southward, towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Therfield,</HI> which lies among the Hills, a little South of <HI>Roy&s;ton,</HI> is obliged to <HI>Francis</HI> Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely,</HI> once Rector of it, who paved the Chancel with Free-&s;tone, the Area of the Altar with Marble; wain&s;coted the Walls, made it into the Form of a Choir, and ceiled it with Fret-work. 'Tis a Rectory of great Value, and is rated in the Fir&s;t-fruits Office, at 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year. Till lately was at <HI>Therfield</HI> Furniture of all Sorts for the U&s;e of poor Peoples Weddings, &s;uch as was at <HI>Braughing</HI>; but they are now lo&s;t, or converted to other U&s;es, even literally to Plough&s;hares and Pea&s;e-hooks.</P>
<P><HI>Barkway</HI> is a Market-town. The Church &s;tands in the mid&s;t of the Town, with an Ayle on each Side, and a Tower with Five Bells, and a Turret-clock. The Creation of the World is painted on one of the Windows. In one Pane at Top is a bodily Repre|&s;entation of the Deity, as a Man in a loo&s;e R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">be, down to his Feet, with the Globe before him,

<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Road, called <HI>Ermine-&s;treet,</HI> pa&s;&s;es thro' the Pari&s;h of <HI>Am&s;ty</HI>; and all the Way upon it we find Remains of Camps and Stations, ex|actly according to the Itinerary. The Ca&s;tle for|merly here, was &s;aid to be built by <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> Earl of <HI>Bologne,</HI> at the Conqueror's Command; and it is not improbable, that there were Fortifi|cations before. It con&s;i&s;ted of a Keep, or round artificial Hill, yet remaining, with a large and deep Fo&s;&s;e about it; the Mount, probably, made from the Ditch. The Barons, in King <HI>John</HI>'s Time, made another Retrenchment South of it, which would contain a Gari&s;on as numerous as the Ca&s;tle would hold. <HI>Henry</HI> III. obliged <HI>Nicolas de Ave&s;tic</HI> to demoli&s;h the additional Fortification, and keep up only the old one.</P>
<P>The Church was built in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. as is &s;aid, out of the Stones of the demoli&s;hed Forti|fications made additional to the Ca&s;tle. It is cer|tainly very old, and built with a low Tower in the Middle, and Two Ayles. The Chancel, perhaps, was rebuilt with the Materials of the Keep, being of later Date. It is large and lofty, and hath Stalls, as if for a Choir.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194"><HI>Buntingford</HI> is the next Town, and lies in the <HI>Cambridge</HI> Road, noted for a great Thorough-fare, 28 computed Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and owes its Being as a Town to the pre&s;ent Po&s;t-road through it to the North. The fir&s;t Mention of it is in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. who gave a Market and a Fair to it. It is &s;ituated in <HI>Lay&s;ton</HI> Pari&s;h; but has a Chapel of Brick, built by Contribution for the Inhabitants here. Dr. <HI>Seth Ward</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who died <HI>Jan.</HI> 6. 1688, built a neat Brick-hou&s;e near the Chapel, for Four poor Men, and Four poor Women, who had lived hand&s;omely, and came to Decay thro' Misfortunes; each of which has Two Rooms below, and Two above. <HI>Buntingford</HI> Free-&s;chool owes much al&s;o to the &s;ame worthy Prelate, who had his Edu|cation in it. He built, 1683, an Ho&s;pital at <HI>Sali&s;|bury,</HI> for Ten poor Widows of Clergymen, was a Benefactor to <HI>Lay&s;ton,</HI> gave a good Sum of Money to make <HI>Salisbury</HI> River navigable; 600<HI>l.</HI> to be laid out in Land, for putting out Three poor Children Apprentices, Two out of <HI>Al&s;eden,</HI> and One out of <HI>Lay&s;ton,</HI> alternately. In &s;hort, the good Bi&s;hop &s;eems to have thought, that the Reve|nues he reaped from the Church, ought to have &s;ome other more publick De&s;ignation, than to lift out of Ob&s;curity a private Family.</P>
<P><HI>Braughing</HI> lies a little on the Ea&s;t of the Road, was antiently, next to <HI>Verulam,</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Place in the County, and is thought to have been the <HI>Roman Cae&s;aromagum,</HI> &s;ituated 28 Miles from <HI>London,</HI> as by <HI>Antoninus</HI>'s <HI>Itinerary.</HI> It &s;till has &s;ome Ruins of its antient Eminence, giving Name to the Deanry and the Hundred. On the We&s;t Side the <HI>Ermin-&s;treet,</HI> now the Road to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> we find the Ruins of a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp.

<P><PB N="194" REF="195">Near the Church-yard is an old Hou&s;e, at pre&s;ent inhabited by poor Families, which was given with all Sorts of Furniture for Weddings.

The Town, in the &s;ame Reign, was incorporated, and returned Members to Seven &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Parlia|ments. The Bi&s;hop was re&s;tored by the &s;ame Prince, and Satisfaction made him for demoli&s;hing the Ca&s;tle. The Hill or Keep of the Ca&s;tle is artificial, made of Earth carried thither, with a Brea&s;t-work at Top of Stones and Morter. A Bank of Earth leads from it thro' the moory Ground, on which it was &s;ituated, to the North-ea&s;t. There is a large Wall from the Top of the Hill yet remaining. The Bi&s;hop's Pri&s;on was in being in Bi&s;hop <HI>Bonner</HI>'s Time; tho' all the old Buildings are &s;ince demoli&s;hed.

<P>At the We&s;t End is another Gallery, built a few Years ago, upon which is an Organ; and it is ob|&s;ervable, that there was an Organ in this Church &s;o long ago as in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII.

<P>In the North Part of the Town was &s;ituated the Priory, now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Family of <HI>Had&s;ley.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="200">An eminent Trade&s;man of <HI>Ware,</HI> having lo&s;t by Death a favourite Mare, which he had had many Years; in Con&s;ideration of her good Services, made, in <HI>March</HI> 1739, a grand Burying for her, and in|vited near 300 People to it. He and his Wife going next the Carca&s;e, as chief Mourners, were followed by the re&s;t of the Company in Couples; and about Four o'Clock &s;he was interred in <HI>Hare-lane-field,</HI> near the Town, with great Pomp: After which the Company returned, and were treated with Plum Cake and Strong Beer, at the Mourner's Hou&s;e, who expre&s;&s;ed great Concern for the Lo&s;s of the valuable Creature.</P>
<P>At <HI>Blake</HI>'s-<HI>ware,</HI> the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Part of the Pari&s;h, is a Seat of <HI>William Plummer,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with a Stream called the <HI>A&s;h,</HI> on the Ea&s;t Front, which feeds a Canal and a Garden by the River-&s;ide. The chief Gardens are &s;een from the we&s;tern Front, which being upon a Declivity, afford an hand&s;ome Pro&s;pect that Way.</P>
<P>A little South of <HI>Ware</HI> lies <HI>Amwell,</HI> a Village, famous for giving Ri&s;e to the <HI>New River,</HI> which pro|ceeding in a direct Cour&s;e by the Church, receives a Spring which flows with great abundance. It is 20 Miles from <HI>London</HI>; but the Cour&s;e of the River is computed at 36. It was begun by Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton</HI>; but he being ruined by the Project, the City of <HI>London</HI> undertook it, and by Aid of an Act of Parliament, brought it to Perfection. The yearly Profit of the River has, &s;ome Years ago, been computed at 30000<HI>l.</HI> and the Expence in &s;upporting and keeping it up, is &s;aid to amount to half the Profit. 'Twas divided originally into 72 Shares, one Moiety whereof belonged to private Per&s;ons, and the other to the Crown: For King <HI>James</HI> I. for the &s;ake of his Palace at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> was a great Pro|moter of it. The Crown's Moiety is &s;ince come into private Hands; who however have no Part in the

Management; for the Corporation con&s;i&s;ts of 29 of the Proprietors of the fir&s;t 36 Shares.</P>
<P>This River, in Fact, draws mo&s;t of its Water from the <HI>Lee</HI>; which being the Property of the City of <HI>London,</HI> that Corporation oppo&s;ed a Bill brought into Parliament, for giving further Powers to the <HI>New River</HI> Company, to benefit it&s;elf by the <HI>Lee</HI> River: But the Oppo&s;ition availed not, and in the Se&s;&s;ion 1738-9 the Bill pa&s;&s;ed into a Law.</P>
<P>The Governors of the <HI>New River</HI> Company agreed with the Proprietors of the Lands on the River <HI>Lee,</HI> for a Cut of Two cubick Feet of Water from the &s;aid River, at a certain Rate; and after the Agreement, they told them they would double the Price for a Four-foot Cut; which the Proprietors agreed to, not con&s;idering the great Di&s;proportion of the Two Cuts. And this Cut of the River <HI>Lee</HI> &s;upplies the large&s;t Share of the <HI>New River</HI> Water.</P>
<P>We kept along the great Road, thro' <HI>Hodde&s;don,</HI> (which is a con&s;iderable Market-town, and noted al&s;o as a Thoroughfare) till we came to <HI>Broxbourn,</HI> which lies near it on the <HI>New River</HI>; a &s;mall, but plea&s;ant Village, &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing Ground, having plea|&s;ant Meadows down to the River <HI>Lee.</HI> On the Left|hand of the Village is <HI>Broxbournbury,</HI> the Seat of the Lord <HI>Mon&s;on.</HI> The Hou&s;e is large, and in the old <HI>Gothick</HI> Style, and &s;ituated in the Middle of the Park (which has been planted and beautified of late). There are al&s;o new Offices erected at a little Di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e, in a Quadrangle, on the &s;ame Plan with the King's <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> at <HI>Charing-cro&s;s.</HI> They are placed behind a large Plantation of Trees, &s;o that they do not appear until you are near upon them, yet are at a convenient Di&s;tance from the Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, which I was informed his Lord&s;hip al&s;o propo&s;es to rebuild.</P>

Trea&s;urer <HI>Burleigh,</HI> who gave it his younger Son Sir <HI>Robert Cecil,</HI> and he exchanged it for that of <HI>Hat|field,</HI> at the De&s;ire of King <HI>James</HI> I. who made it his Sporting Seat; and here ended his Life.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I NOW proceed to give you an Account of my next Journey thro' Part of <HI>Bucks,</HI> into <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> and &s;hall touch upon &s;ome Parts of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> of which I have not-yet taken notice.</P>
<P>On the Right-hand, as we ride from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Uxbridge</HI> or to <HI>Colebrook,</HI> we &s;ee <HI>Harrow</HI>; the Church of which &s;tanding on the Summit of an Hill, and having a very high Spire, they tell us, King <HI>Charles</HI> II. ridiculing the warm Di&s;putes among &s;ome critical Scripturali&s;ts of tho&s;e Times, concerning the <HI>Vi&s;ible</HI> Church of Chri&s;t upon Earth; u&s;ed to &s;ay, This was it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Uxbridge</HI> we proceeded on the Road towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> and came to <HI>Beaconsfield,</HI> a &s;mall Town on the Road to <HI>Oxford,</HI> full of good Inns, and &s;ituated on a dry Hill, famous for the Re&s;idence of Mr. <HI>Edmund Waller,</HI> eminent for his poetical Talent.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">Then we went on to <HI>Wickham,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>High</HI> or <HI>Chipping Wycoomb,</HI> from <HI>Coomb,</HI> a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word for Valley. This is a large Town, con&s;i&s;ting of one great principal Street, branching out into divers &s;mall ones. It is full of good Hou&s;es and Inns, being a great Thorough-fare from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Wickham</HI> lies <HI>Amer&s;ham</HI> or <HI>Agmon|de&s;ham,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town, very antient; and a little beyond it you go thro' <HI>Che&s;ham,</HI> a little in|con&s;iderable Market-town; and likewi&s;e <HI>Wendover,</HI> a mean, dirty corporate Town. From hence we proceeded to <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> which is the large&s;t and be&s;t Town in the County.&mdash;It &s;tands on a Hill, but the Country round it is low and dirty. It con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal large Streets, and has a hand&s;ome built Market-hou&s;e, which &s;tands in a kind of Quadrangle. It has al&s;o a Town-hou&s;e, where the A&s;&s;izes and Se&s;&s;ions, and other publick Meetings of the County, are held. Provi&s;ions are here cheap and plentiful, which is owing to the rich Vale adjoining. It was a &s;trong Town in the Beginning of the <HI>Saxons</HI> Time, and a Manor Royal in that of the <HI>Conqueror</HI>'s, who parcell'd it out under this odd Tenure, That the Tenants &s;hould find <HI>Litter or Straw for the King's Bed-chambers</HI> Three times a Year, if he came that Way &s;o often, and provide him Three Eels in Winter, and Three Green Gee&s;e in Summer; which would be but a mean Entertainment at Bed and Board for a King in the&s;e Days.</P>
<P>All round this Town is a large Track of the riche&s;t Land in <HI>England,</HI> extended for many Miles almo&s;t from <HI>Tame,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> to <HI>Leighton</HI> in <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> and is called from this very Town, <HI>The Vale of Aylesbury.</HI> It is famous for fat|tening Cattle and Sheep, and 'tis frequent that they &s;ell a Ram here for Breeding for Ten Pounds. Here it was, that conver&s;ing with &s;ome Gentlemen who under&s;tood Country Affairs, (for all Gentlemen here|abouts
<PB N="204" REF="205">
are Graziers, tho' all the Graziers are not Gentlemen) they &s;hewed me one remarkable in|clo&s;ed Field of Pa&s;ture-ground, which was lett for 1400<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to a Grazier; and I knew the Tenant very well, who&s;e Name was <HI>Houghton,</HI> who confirmed the Truth of it.</P>
<P>The late Duke of <HI>Wharton</HI> had a very fine Seat at <HI>Winchenden,</HI> and another much finer nearer <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> called <HI>Ubourn.</HI> But the Cata&s;trophe that has befallen this once flouri&s;hing and truly noble Family, is too melancholy, and too well known, to be animadverted upon here.</P>
<P>Near this Place lies <HI>Chilton,</HI> famous for giving Birth to that &s;teddy Patriot the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Crook,</HI> who &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the arbitrary Mea|&s;ures of levying Ship-money without the Authority of Parliament.</P>
<P>South-we&s;t of <HI>Aylesbury</HI> lies the Market-town of <HI>Tame,</HI> &s;ituated on the Side of a Meadow, and almo&s;t incompa&s;&s;ed with Rivulets. It con&s;i&s;ts of one long broad Street. The Church is large and fine, in Form of a Cro&s;s; near which are the Ruins of a Priory. A Pot of <HI>Roman</HI> Coin was found here about 15 Years &s;ince.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thame</HI> joins the other Branch, named al&s;o the <HI>Thames,</HI> at <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> in <HI>Oxford&s;hire.</HI> In this Vale of <HI>Aylesbury</HI> flouri&s;hed the great and antient Family of <HI>Hampden,</HI> for many Ages, in the Enjoy|ment of very large E&s;tates, which, like that of <HI>Wharton,</HI> are now di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>At the Confluence of the <HI>Thame</HI> and <HI>I&s;is,</HI> &s;tands <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> a Town of Note among the antient <HI>Romans,</HI> and in the Year 634 was made a Bi&s;hop's See, till <HI>Remigius,</HI> in 1094, removed it to <HI>Lincoln.</HI> It has a very large Church, and a fine large Stone Bridge, of great Length and Antiquity.</P>
<P>Ea&s;t of <HI>Aylesbury</HI> lies <HI>Ivingo,</HI> a plea&s;ant Market-town &s;ituate among Woods, in a Nook, or kind of
<PB N="205" REF="206">
Penin&s;ula, which runs in between <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Hertford&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed forward North-we&s;t thro' <HI>Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">low,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town, to <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the County-Town, &s;ituated in a low, fruitful Ground, &s;urrounded by the <HI>Ouze</HI> on all Sides but the North. 'Tis govern'd by a Bailiff and Capital Burge&s;&s;es. The Ca&s;tle is now old and ruinous, and the Buildings of the Town are al&s;o old. It has Three Stone Bridges over the River, and a well-built Church, and a Chapel built by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Becket,</HI> which is now u&s;ed for a Free-&s;chool. Several Paper-mills are erected on the <HI>Ouze,</HI> and the Town is divided into two Parts; one where the Church &s;tands, and the other where the Town|hall is. The County Gaol, and Court, are kept here, and &s;ometimes the A&s;&s;izes.</P>
<P>Going &s;till farther Northward, we come to the following Towns:</P>
<P><HI>Stony Stratford</HI> is remarkable for &s;tanding on the <HI>Roman</HI> Cau&s;eway, called <HI>Watling-&s;treet.</HI> It is an antient and well-known Thoroughfare Town in the <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> Road from <HI>London.</HI> It is large, and well-built of Stone, has Two Churches in it, and a Cro&s;s erected by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to the Honour of his Queen <HI>Eleanor,</HI> and has a good Stone Bridge over the River. The principal Manufacture, as well in the Neigh|bourhood as in the Town, is Bone-lace.</P>
<P><HI>Newport-pagnell</HI> is a large well-built, populous Town, &s;eated on the River <HI>Ouze,</HI> over which it has Two large Stone Bridges. It carries on a great Trade in Bone-lace, and the &s;ame Manufacture imploys al&s;o the neighbouring Villages.</P>
<P><HI>Oulney</HI> is a pretty good Town, where al&s;o is carried on a con&s;iderable Manufacture of Bone-lace. It lies on the Extremity of the County.</P>
<P>We then fell down, back again, to <HI>Buckingham</HI>; and following the great Road North-we&s;t, we came to <HI>Brackley,</HI> in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> &s;ituate on the River
<PB N="206" REF="207">
<HI>Ouze,</HI> an antient large corporate Town, in which are Two Pari&s;h Churches. It had formerly a College, but it is now u&s;ed for a Free-&s;chool. It is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen; and the Market u&s;ed to be the Staple for Wool, in that County; but it is now removed.</P>
<P>We next came to <HI>Banbury</HI> in <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> on the River <HI>Charwell.</HI> It is a large Market-town under the Government of a Mayor and Aldermen. It has a con&s;iderable Trade, e&s;pecially in Chee&s;e, as all the Country round it is a rich feeding Meadow-ground. Here the famous <HI>Make-king,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and his Brother, of the Party of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. and beheaded them.</P>
<P>On the Borders of this County We&s;tward from this Town in <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> was the famous Battle of <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> fought between the Forces of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and tho&s;e of the Parliament; where, tho' the Victory was dubious, yet the Advantage, in the Event, inclined to the King's Side; for he thereupon took Lord <HI>Say</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Broughton,</HI> and <HI>Banbury</HI> Ca&s;tle, in which were 800 Foot, and a Troop of Hor&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Edge-hill</HI> lies at the We&s;t End of the Vale of <HI>Red|hor&s;e,</HI> and gives a mo&s;t exten&s;ive Pro&s;pect. It is &s;teep to the North, and on the Top of it, at <HI>Warmlington,</HI> is a &s;trong large Entrenchment, &s;aid to be <HI>Dani&s;h,</HI> but looks more like <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI> On the De&s;cent of the Hill, between <HI>Radway</HI> and <HI>Keynton,</HI> was fought the aforementioned Battle; here al&s;o they &s;hew where the Slain were bury'd, and have a Tra|dition, that King <HI>John</HI> had a Palace, and re&s;ided at <HI>Keyntor.</HI></P>
<P>There was likewi&s;e, at <HI>Cropredy</HI> Bridge, an En|counter between the <HI>Royali&s;ts</HI> and the <HI>Parliament|arians</HI> under <HI>Waller</HI>'s Command.</P>
<P>We&s;t of <HI>Edge-hill</HI> &s;tands <HI>Shipton,</HI> a little Town, which has a very large Market.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208"><HI>Banbury</HI> gave Title of Earl to the noble Family of <HI>Knolles,</HI> which it &s;eems became extinct in 1632, when the la&s;t Earl died; but his Wife, marrying <HI>Nicolas</HI> Lord <HI>Vaux,</HI> had a Son by him, who took the Name of <HI>Knolles,</HI> and the Title of Earl; but was never &s;ummoned to Parliament, nor his Son after him, who is now living, and commonly called Lord <HI>Banbury.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we rode Southward to <HI>Deddington,</HI> a large Town, but a very &s;mall Market. It is govern'd by a Bailiff, and did formerly return Members to Parliament.</P>
<P>We turned a little Ea&s;t, and came to <HI>Bice&s;ter,</HI> a &s;traggling indifferent Town; but remarkable for having had once a famous City in its Neighbourhood, called <HI>Aldche&s;ter,</HI> long &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed over by the Plough; and where many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, Stones, and other Antiquities are found; which was undoubtedly the <HI>Maima</HI> of <HI>Ravennas. Bice&s;ter</HI> is famous for excellent Malt Liquor, and has had formerly a Re|ligious Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;lip</HI> lying directly in our Way to <HI>Oxford,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed thro' it. It is remarkable for the Birth of <HI>Edward the Confe&s;&s;or,</HI> and that Dr. <HI>South,</HI> as well as other eminent Divines, were Mini&s;ters here. There are &s;ome Remains of an antient Palace &s;till left.</P>
<P>From hence I came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> famous for &s;everal Things, but chiefly for its being the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and con&s;iderable Univer&s;ity in the World.</P>
<P>There has been a long Conte&s;t between the Two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Univer&s;ities, about the Priority of their Foundations, which perhaps will never be decided, and &s;o I pa&s;s it over.</P>
<P>It is out of Que&s;tion, that in the Largene&s;s of the Place, the Beauty of Situation, the Number of Inhabitants, and of Scholars, <HI>Oxford</HI> has the Advan|tage. In &s;hort, <HI>Oxford</HI> has &s;everal Things as an
<PB N="208" REF="209">
Univer&s;ity, which <HI>Cambridge</HI> has not; and <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> has &s;everal Things in it, which cannot be found in <HI>Oxford.</HI> For Example,</P>
<P>The Theatre, the Mu&s;eum or Chamber of Ra|rities, the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library, the Number of Colleges, and the Magnificence of their Buildings, are on the Side of <HI>Oxford</HI>; yet <HI>King's</HI> College Chapel, and Col|lege, is in favour of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> being one of the fine&s;t Structures of its kind that can be &s;een; and the new Buildings erected lately there, make that whole Univer&s;ity &s;till more con&s;iderable in this way.</P>
<P><HI>Oxford</HI> is a noble flouri&s;hing City, &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all that can contribute to make the Re&s;idence of the Scholars ea&s;y and comfortable, that no Spot of Ground in <HI>England</HI> goes beyond it. It is &s;ituated in a delight|ful Plain, on the Bank of a fine navigable River, in a plentiful Country, and at an ea&s;y Di&s;tance from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The City it&s;elf is large, populous and rich: and as it is adorn'd by the mo&s;t beautiful Buildings of Colleges and Halls, it makes the mo&s;t noble Figure of any City of its Bigne&s;s in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall pre&s;ent our Readers with a Li&s;t of the Colleges and Halls in this famous City, with a brief Hi&s;tory of them; but mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that as it would exceed our Limits to give an Account of the particular Benefactions by which their Revenues and Buildings are &s;o &s;plendidly augmented, we &s;hall only mention &s;uch of tho&s;e Benefactions as have been conferred within &s;o few Years back, that they are not likely to be found in other Authors.</P>

<P>You will refer, Sir, to the Accounts I have already given of the Colleges, and to the above Ab&s;tracts of Dr. <HI>Radcliff</HI>'s, and Dr. <HI>Clarke</HI>'s Wills, and you will have a View of the State of the&s;e Colleges, even when the Works are fini&s;hed as directed by tho&s;e Gentle|men, and which will hold for Years to come without material Alteration, except in ca&s;e of new Bene|factions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now give a Summary of what a Traveller may ob&s;erve further in <HI>Oxford, en pa&s;&s;ant</HI>; and re|fer the more curious Inquirer to the Hi&s;tories of the Place, for a more ample and particular Account, than I have room to give.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Colleges and Halls, there are &s;ome publick Buildings, which make a mo&s;t glorious Ap|pearance: The fir&s;t and greate&s;t of all is the <HI>Theatre,</HI> a Building not to be equall'd by any thing of its Kind and Bigne&s;s in the World. Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren</HI> was the Director of the Work. Archbi&s;hop <HI>Sheldon</HI> paid for it, and gave it to the Univer&s;ity: there is a world of Decoration in the Front of it, and more beautiful Additions, by way of Ornament; and the in&s;ide Roof, finely painted and decorated, is never enough to be admired.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library is an Ornament in it&s;elf worthy of this famous Univer&s;ity. I have not Room for its Hi&s;tory at large, but &s;hall briefly ob&s;erve, that the fir&s;t publick Library in <HI>Oxford</HI> was erected in <HI>Durham</HI> College, now <HI>Trinity,</HI> by <HI>Richard</HI> Bi&s;hop of
<PB N="228" REF="229">
<HI>Durham,</HI> Lord Trea&s;urer to <HI>Edward</HI> III. it was afterward joined to another, founded by <HI>Cobham</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and both inlarged by the Bounty of <HI>Humphry</HI> Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> Founder of the Divinity Schools. But the&s;e Libraries being lo&s;t, and the Books embezzled, and the Place where they were depo&s;ited, quite ruinous, Sir <HI>Thomas Bodley,</HI> a wealthy and learned Knight, having, at a va&s;t Expence, collected Books and Manu&s;cripts from all Parts of the World, placed them in the old Library-room, built by the good Duke <HI>Humphry.</HI></P>
<P>This great Work was brought to an Head the 8th of <HI>Nov.</HI> 1602, and has continued increa&s;ing by the Benefactions of great and learned Men to this Day; &s;uch as Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Pembroke, Oliver Cromwell, Selden, Digby,</HI> and other great Names.</P>
<P>Over it is a &s;pacious Gallery, adorned with Pictures of Founders, Benefactors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with the antique Marbles, which were the learned Part of the inex|hau&s;tible Collection of the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> which have been illu&s;trated with the accurate Comments of <HI>Selden</HI> and <HI>Prideaux.</HI> Here are &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable <HI>Greek</HI> Monuments now in the World. Over the Porch, upon an hand&s;ome Pede&s;tal of black Mar|ble, &s;tands the Bra&s;s Effigies of the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> their noble and generous Chancellor, given by the late Earl, moulded by <HI>Rubens.</HI> Al&s;o a very large Collection of <HI>Greek, Roman, Briti&s;h, Saxon, Eng|li&s;h,</HI> and other Coins, pre&s;ented by Sir <HI>T. Roe,</HI> and other Hands. And that indefatigable and learned Collector of Books, and valuable Manu&s;cripts, Dr. <HI>Tanner,</HI> Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> who died <HI>December</HI> 12. 1735, bequeathed the mo&s;t curious Part of his fine Collection to this noble Library.</P>
<P>In the Year 1740, by the Death of Mrs. <HI>Crew,</HI> Relict of <HI>George Crew,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> an E&s;tate of 80<HI>l. per Annum</HI> is fallen to the Head Librarian's Po&s;t, which
<PB N="229" REF="230">
before was very incon&s;iderable, tho' it required a con&s;tant Re&s;idence. This was a Legacy of the late Right Reverend and Right Honourable <HI>Nathanael Crew,</HI> Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> who was &s;uch a good Benefactor to <HI>Lincoln</HI> College as we have mentioned.</P>
<P>Other curious Things in <HI>Oxford</HI> are, the Schools, (which are now beautifully repaired, and the Names and Arms of old Benefactors renewed and repainted) the Mu&s;eum, the Chamber of Rarities, the Collec|tion of Coins, Medals, Pictures, and antient In&s;crip|tions, the Printing-hou&s;e, the Phy&s;ick-garden, the Univer&s;ity and other Churches, the Convocation-hou&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all worthy of a particular De&s;cription, had I room to give it.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;ity is govern'd by a Chancellor, cho&s;en by Scrutiny or Collection of Votes; he is generally one of the fir&s;t Noblemen of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>By a High-&s;teward, cho&s;en by the Chancellor.</P>
<P>By a Vice-chancellor, who mu&s;t be one of the Heads of a College, recommended to the Univer&s;ity by the Chancellor.</P>
<P>By Two Proctors, cho&s;en annually by Turn out of the Colleges.</P>
<P>The other Officers are the publick Orator, and the Keeper of the Archives, Beadles, Virger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' I have &s;aid &s;o much of the Univer&s;ity, I mu&s;t not quite forget the City. Let me then ob|&s;erve, That before <HI>Baliol</HI> College they &s;hew the Stone in the Street, which marks the Place of the Martyrdom of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer</HI> and Bi&s;hop <HI>Ridley,</HI> then upon the Banks of the Ditch, without the City Walls, which went along where the Theatre now &s;tands.</P>
<P>Beyond the River, &s;tood <HI>O&s;eny</HI> Abbey, founded 1129. Upon the Bridge is a Tower, call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>Frier</HI> Bacon<HI>'s Study,</HI> from that famous and learned Monk.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="231">Over another Bridge, on the <HI>I&s;is,</HI> we went to &s;ee <HI>Ruleigh</HI> Abbey, where &s;ome Ruins &s;till remain, turn'd to a common Brewhou&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the Ca&s;tle remains a &s;quare high Tower, by the River-&s;ide, and a lofty Mount, or Keep, walled at Top, with a Stair-ca&s;e going downward.</P>
<P>The <HI>White-friers</HI> was a Royal Palace, and near a Green called <HI>Beaumonds,</HI> they &s;hew'd us the Bottom of a Tower upon the Spot where the valiant <HI>Richard</HI> I. was born.</P>
<P>Without the Town, on all Hands, are to be &s;een the Fortifications erected in the late Civil Wars.</P>
<P>As to the City, tho' the Colleges make up Two-thirds of it, and are &s;till elbowing for more Room, yet 'tis large and regular, the Streets are &s;pacious, clean, and &s;trait; the Place plea&s;ant and healthful, the Inhabitants genteel and courteous; the Churches many and elegant, e&s;pecially <HI>Allhallows</HI>; and taking it altogether, and including the Grandeur and En|dowment of the Colleges, their Chapels, Halls, Li|braries, Quadrangles, Piazza's, Gardens, Walks, Groves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd as the fir&s;t Uni|ver&s;ity in the World, as I have before mention'd.</P>
<P>On the Left-hand, on the other Side the River, the la&s;t Remains of <HI>God&s;tow</HI> Nunnery are &s;ituated among the &s;weet Meadows. Here fair <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI> had a remarkably fine Tomb; but before the Di&s;&s;o|lution, &s;carce could her A&s;hes re&s;t, <HI>who&s;e Beauty was thought guilty,</HI> as one &s;ays, <HI>even after Death.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot leave <HI>Oxford</HI> without making one Ob|&s;ervation, with regard to tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t, that it was to the Piety of the Popi&s;h Times which we owe the fir&s;t In&s;titution of the Univer&s;ity it&s;elf, the Foundation and Endowment of the particular Col|leges, and the Encouragement ari&s;ing to Learning from thence: all which I readily grant; but would have them remember too, that tho' tho&s;e Foundations &s;tood, as they tell us, 800 Years, and that the Re|formation,
<PB N="231" REF="232">
as they &s;ay, is not above 200 Years &s;tanding, yet Learning has more increa&s;ed, and the Univer&s;ities flouri&s;h'd more; more great Scholars been produced, greater Libraries been rai&s;ed, and more fine Buildings been erected, in the&s;e 200 Years, than in the 800 Years of Popery; and I might add, as many great Benefactions have been given, not|with&s;tanding this very momentous Difference, that the Prote&s;tants Gifts are merely Acts of Charity to the World, and Acts of Bounty, in Reverence to Learning, and learned Men, without the grand In|citement of the State of their own Souls, and tho&s;e of their Fathers, which were to be pray'd out of Purgatory, and get a ready Admi&s;&s;ion into Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Oxford</HI> was for many Years advantaged by the Neighbourhood of the Royal Court, while &s;everal Kings of <HI>England,</HI> being taken with the fine Situation of <HI>Wood&s;tock,</HI> made their Palace there the Place of their Summer Retreat.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Plott</HI> allows it to have been a Royal Hou&s;e ever &s;ince King <HI>Alfred</HI>; and a Manu&s;cript in the <HI>Cotton</HI> Library confirms it; and that King <HI>Henry</HI> I. was not the Founder of it, but only rebuilt it. And as for <HI>Henry</HI> II. who kept his fair <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI> in it, he made only &s;ome Additions to it, for the Entertain|ment and Security of his beautiful Mi&s;tre&s;s. Not|with&s;tanding which, the Queen, having got Acce&s;s to her in the King's Ab&s;ence, as Tradition informs us, di&s;patch'd her by Poi&s;on.</P>
<P>When I was fir&s;t at <HI>Wood&s;tock</HI> &s;ome Years ago, I &s;aw part of the old Palace, and the famous Labyrinth of fair <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI>; but now the&s;e are de&s;troy'd. Her <HI>Bathing-place</HI> or <HI>Well,</HI> as it is called, is left; a quadrangular Receptacle of pure Water, immediately flowing from a little Spring under the Hill, over|&s;hadow'd with Trees; near which are &s;ome Ruins of Walls and Arches. King <HI>Ethelred</HI> called a Parlia|ment here. It has been a Royal Seat, as I have &s;aid,
<PB N="232" REF="233">
from mo&s;t antient Times. <HI>Henry</HI> I. inclo&s;ed the Park. Acro&s;s this Valley was a remarkably fine Echo, that would repeat a whole Hexameter, but impair'd by the Removal of the&s;e Buildings. A &s;tately Bridge, or Rialto rather, now leads along the grand Approach to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;tle: one Arch is above 190 Feet Diameter; a Ca&s;cade of Water falls from a Lake down &s;ome &s;tone Steps into the Canal that runs under it.</P>
<P>The new Palace of <HI>Blenheim</HI> is a va&s;t and magni|ficent Pile of Building; a Royal Gift to the high Merit of the invincible Duke of <HI>Marlborough.</HI> The lofty Hall is painted by Sir <HI>James Thornhill,</HI> the Ceiling by <HI>la Guerre.</HI> The Rooms are finely inrich'd with Marble Chimney-pieces and Furniture, but more by the incomparable Paintings and Hangings, which latter repre&s;ent the principal Glories of the Duke's Life. Among the Pictures are many of <HI>Rubens</HI>'s be&s;t and large&s;t Pieces; that celebrated one of him&s;elf, his Wife and Child, among others: <HI>Van|dyke</HI>'s King <HI>Charles</HI> I. upon a Dun Hor&s;e, of great Value: and the famous Loves of the Gods, by <HI>Titian</HI>; a Pre&s;ent from the King of <HI>Sardinia.</HI> The Gallery is worthy Admiration, lined with Marble Pila&s;ters, and whole Pillars of one Piece, &s;upporting a mo&s;t co&s;tly and curious Entablature, excellent for Matter and Workman&s;hip, the Window-frames of the &s;ame, and a Ba&s;ement of black Marble quite round. Before it, is &s;tretched out a mo&s;t agreeable Pro&s;pect of the fine Woods beyond the great Valleys. What is of the mo&s;t elegant Ta&s;te in the whole Hou&s;e, is of the Duche&s;s's own De&s;igning. The Chapel is equal to the re&s;t. The Garden is a very large Plot of Ground taken out of the Park, and may &s;till be &s;aid to be a Part of it, well-contriv'd by &s;inking the outer Wall into a Fo&s;s, to give a View quite round, and take off the odious Appearance of Con|finement and Limitation to the Eye. It is within

well adorn'd with Walks, Greens, E&s;paliers, and Vi&s;ta's, to divers remarkable Objects, that offer them|&s;elves in the circumjacent Country. Over the Pedi|ment of this Front of the Hou&s;e is a curious Marble Bu&s;to of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. bigger than the Life, taken from the Gate of the Citadel of <HI>Tournay.</HI> The Orangery is a pretty Room. Near the Gate of the Palace is the Hou&s;e where our famous <HI>Chaucer</HI> was born. At the Entrance into the Ca&s;tle from the Town, her Grace has erected a noble triumphal Arch, to the Memory of the Duke; and has &s;et up a va&s;t Obeli&s;k in the principal Avenue of the Park, whereon is in&s;cribed the be&s;t Account of the Duke's Actions and Character, that ever was penn'd in the &s;ame Compa&s;s; and if done by the ma&s;terly Hand of that extraordinary Genius, to whom I have heard it attributed, mu&s;t be a double Triumph to the Memory of the Duke, &s;ince his Merits extorted &s;o noble a Te&s;timony from a Per&s;on who was once engaged in Mea&s;ures quite oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e, which derived upon his Grace &s;o exalted a Reputation, and who was thought to be at that Time one of his principal Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>The In&s;cription does &s;o much Honour to the Me|mory of the Duke, and at the &s;ame time to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, that I cannot deny to my&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of in&s;erting it here, as follows:

At the End of a Life &s;pent in defending the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> he &s;aw them in their greate&s;t Danger. He provided for their Security in the mo&s;t effectual Manner. He took the Duke of MARLBOROUGH into his Service.</P>
<P>Emba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary<LB>To the <HI>States General</HI> of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI></P>
<P>The Duke contracted &s;everal Alliance before the Death of King WILLIAM. He confirmed and improved the&s;e. He contracted others, after the Acce&s;&s;ion of Queen ANNE; and reunited the Confederacy, which had been di&s;&s;olved at the End of a former War, in a &s;tricter and firmer League.</P>
<P>Captain-General and Commander in Chief<LB>Of the Forces of GREAT BRITAIN,</P>
<P>The Duke led to the Field the Army of the Allies. He took with &s;urpri&s;ing Rapidity <HI>Venlo, Ruremonde, Ste|ven&s;waert</HI> and <HI>Liege.</HI> He extended and &s;ecured the Fron|tiers
<PB N="235" REF="236">
of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The Enemies, whom he found in&s;ulting at the Gates of <HI>Nimeghen,</HI> were driven to &s;eek for Shelter behind their Lines. He forced <HI>Bonne, Huy, Limburgh,</HI> in another Campaign. He opened the Com|munication of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as well as the <HI>Maes.</HI> He added all the Country between the&s;e Rivers to his former Conque&s;ts. The Army of <HI>France,</HI> favoured by the Defection of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> had penetrated into the Heart of the <HI>Empire.</HI> This mighty Body lay expo&s;ed to immediate Ruin. In that memorable Cri&s;is, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH led his Troops with un|exampled Celerity, Secrecy, Order, from the <HI>Ocean</HI> to the <HI>Danube.</HI> He &s;aw: He attacked: Nor &s;topped, but to conquer the Enemy. He forced the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> &s;u&s;tained by the <HI>French,</HI> in their &s;trong Intrenchments at <HI>Schellenberg.</HI> He pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Danube.</HI> A &s;econd Royal Army, compo&s;ed of the be&s;t Troops of <HI>France,</HI> was &s;ent to reinforce the fir&s;t. That of the Confederates was divided. With one Part of it the Siege of <HI>Ingol|&s;tadt</HI> was carried on. With the other the Duke gave Battle to the united Strength of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Bavaria.</HI> On the 2d Day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1704, he gained a more glorious Victory than the Hi&s;tories of any Age can boa&s;t. The Heaps of Slain were dreadful Proofs of his Valour. A Mar&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> whole Legions of <HI>French,</HI> his Pri&s;oners, proclaimed his Mercy. <HI>Bavaria</HI> was &s;ubdued, <HI>Ratisbon, Augsbourg, Ulm, Meminghen,</HI> all the U&s;urpa|tions of the Enemy, were recovered. The Liberty of the <HI>Diet,</HI> the Peace of the <HI>Empire,</HI> were re&s;tored. From the <HI>Danube,</HI> the Duke turned his victorious Arms towards the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the <HI>Mo&s;elle. Landau, Treves, Traerbach,</HI> were taken. In the Cour&s;e of one Campaign the very Nature of the War was changed. The Invaders of other States were reduced to defend their own. The Frontier of <HI>France</HI> was expo&s;ed in its weake&s;t Part to the Efforts of the Allies.</P>
<P>That he might improve this Advantage, that he might pu&s;h the Sum of Things to a &s;peedy Deci&s;ion, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH led his Troops early in the following Year once more to the <HI>Mo&s;elle.</HI> They, whom he had &s;aved a few Months before, neglected to &s;econd

him now. They, who might have been his Compa|nions in Conque&s;t, refu&s;ed to join him. When he &s;aw the generous De&s;igns he had formed, fru&s;trated by private Intere&s;t, by Pique, by Jealou&s;y, he returned with Speed to the <HI>Maes.</HI> He returned; and Fortune and Victory returned with him. <HI>Liege</HI> was relieved; <HI>Huy</HI> retaken. The <HI>French,</HI> who had pre&s;&s;ed the Army of the <HI>States-General</HI> with &s;uperior Numbers, retired behind In|trenchments, which they deemed impregnable. The Duke forced the&s;e Intrenchments, with incon&s;iderable Lo&s;s, on the 7th Day of <HI>July</HI> 1705, He defeated a great Part of the Army which defended them. The re&s;t e&s;caped by a precipitate Retreat. If Advantages proportionable to this Succe&s;s were not immediately obtained, let the Failure be a&s;cribed to that Misfortune which attends mo&s;t Confederacies; a Divi&s;ion of Opi|nions, where one alone &s;hould judge; a Divi&s;ion of Power, where one alone &s;hould command. The Di&s;|appointment it&s;elf did Honour to the Duke. It became the Wonder of Mankind how he could do &s;o much under tho&s;e Re&s;traints, which had hindred him from doing more.</P>
<P>Powers more ab&s;olute were given him afterwards. The Increa&s;e of his Powers multiplied his Victories. At the opening of the next Campaign, when all his Army was not yet a&s;&s;embled; when it was hardly known, that he had taken the Field; the Noi&s;e of his Triumphs was heard over <HI>Europe.</HI> On the 12th of <HI>May</HI> 1706, he attacked the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Ramillies.</HI> In the Space of Two Hours the whole Army was put to Flight. The Vigour and Conduct, with which he improved this Succe&s;s, were equal to tho&s;e, wherewith he gained it. <HI>Louvain, Bru&s;&s;els, Malines, Liere, Ghent, Oudenard, Antwerp, Damme, Bruges, Courtray,</HI> &s;urrendered. <HI>O&s;|tend, Menin, Dendermond</HI> and <HI>Aeth,</HI> were taken. <HI>Bra|bant</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> were recovered. Places which had re&s;i&s;ted the greate&s;t Generals for Months, for Years; Provinces di&s;puted for Ages; were the Conque&s;ts of a Summer. Nor was the Duke content to triumph alone. Solicitous for the general Intere&s;t, his Care
<PB N="237" REF="238">
extended to the remote&s;t Scenes of the War. He cho&s;e to le&s;&s;en his own Army, that he might enable the Leaders of other Armies to conquer. To this it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed that <HI>Turin</HI> was relieved; the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> rein&s;tated; the <HI>French</HI> driven with Confu&s;ion out of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Victories gave the Confederates an Opportunity of carrying on the War on every Side into the Dominions of <HI>France.</HI> But &s;he continu'd to enjoy a kind of peaceful Neutrality in <HI>Germany.</HI> From <HI>Italy</HI> &s;he was once alarm'd, and had no more to fear. The intire Reduction of his Power, who&s;e Ambition had cau&s;ed, who&s;e Strength &s;upported the War, &s;eemed re&s;erved for him alone, who had &s;o triumphantly begun the glori|ous Work.</P>
<P>The Barrier of <HI>France,</HI> on the Side of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> had been forming for more than half a Century. What Art, Power, Expence could do, had been done to ren|der it impenetrable. Yet here &s;he was mo&s;t expo&s;ed; for here the Duke of MARLBOROUGH threatened to attack her.</P>
<P>To cover what they had gained by Surprize, or had been yielded to them by Treachery, the <HI>French</HI> marched to the Banks of the <HI>Schelde.</HI> At their Head were the Princes of the Blood, and their mo&s;t fortunate General the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me.</HI> Thus commanded, thus po&s;t|ed, they hoped to check the Victor in his Cour&s;e. Vain were their Hopes. The Duke of MARLBOROUGH pa&s;&s;ed the River in their Sight. He defeated their whole Army. The Approach of Night concealed, the Proximity of <HI>Ghent</HI> favoured their Flight. They neglected nothing to repair their Lo&s;s, to defend their Frontier. New Generals, new Armies appeared in the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> All contributed to inhance the Glory, none were able to retard the Progre&s;s, of the confederate Army.</P>
<P><HI>Li&s;le,</HI> the Bulwark of this Barrier, was be&s;ieged. A nu|merous Gari&s;on, and a Mar&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> defended the Place. Prince EUGENE of <HI>Savoy</HI> commanded, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH covered and &s;u&s;tained the Siege. The Rivers were &s;eized, and the Communication with
<PB N="238" REF="239">
<HI>Holland</HI> interrupted. The Duke opened new Commu|nications with great Labour, and much greater Art. Through Countries over-run by the Enemy, the nece&s;|&s;ary Convoys arriv'd in Safety. One alone was attacked. The Troops which attacked it were beat. The Defence of <HI>Li&s;le</HI> was animated by A&s;&s;urances of Relief.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> a&s;&s;embled all their Force. They marched towards the Town. The Duke of MARLBOROUGH offered them Battle, without &s;u&s;pending the Siege. They abandoned the Enterprize. They came to &s;ave the Town. They were Spectators of its Fall.</P>
<P>From this Conque&s;t the Duke ha&s;tened to others. The Po&s;ts taken by the Enemy on the <HI>Schelde</HI> were &s;urpri&s;ed. That River was pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd time, and notwith|&s;tanding the great Preparations made to prevent it, without Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> be&s;ieged by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> was relieved. <HI>Ghent</HI> &s;urrendered to the Duke in the Middle of a Win|ter remarkably &s;evere. An Army, little inferior to his own, marched out of the Place.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Sea&s;on of the Year permitted him to open another Campaign, the Duke be&s;ieged and took <HI>Tour|nay.</HI> He inve&s;ted <HI>Mons.</HI> Near this City, the <HI>French</HI> Army, covered by thick Woods, defended by noble Intrenchments, waited to mole&s;t, nor pre&s;umed to offer Battle. Even this was not attempted by them with Impunity. On the la&s;t Day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1709, the Duke attacked them in their Camp. All was employed; nothing availed again&s;t the Re&s;olution of &s;uch a General, again&s;t the Fury of &s;uch Troops. The Battle was bloody. The Event deci&s;ive. The Woods were pierced. The Fortifications trampled down. The Enemy fled. The Town was taken. <HI>Doway, Bethune, Aire, St. Venant, Bouchain,</HI> underwent the &s;ame Fate in Two &s;ucceeding Years. Their vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance could not &s;ave them. The Army of <HI>France</HI> dur&s;t not attempt to relieve them. It &s;eemed pre&s;erved to defend the Capital of the Monarchy.</P>
<P>The Pro&s;pect of this extreme Di&s;tre&s;s was neither di&s;tant nor dubious. The <HI>French</HI> acknowleged their Con|queror, and &s;ued for Peace.</P><PB N="239" REF="240">The&s;e are the Actions of the late Duke of MARLBOROUGH,<LB>Performed in the Compa&s;s of a few Years,<LB>Sufficient to adorn the Annals of Ages.<LB>The Admiration of other Nations<LB>Will be conveyed to late&s;t Po&s;terity,<LB>In the Hi&s;tories even of the Enemies of BRITAIN.<LB>The Sen&s;e which the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation had<LB>Of his tran&s;cendent Merit,<LB>Was expre&s;&s;ed<LB>In the mo&s;t &s;olemn, mo&s;t effectual, mo&s;t durable manner.<LB>The Acts of Parliament <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several Recitals of Clau&s;es in Acts of Parliament made to do Honour to this immortal Commander, are engraven on the &s;ame &s;uperb Pillar.</NOTE> in&s;cribed on this Pillar<LB>Shall &s;tand<LB>As long as the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Name and Language la&s;t,<LB>Illu&s;trious Monuments<LB>Of MARLBOROUGH's Glory,<LB>And<LB>Of BRITAIN's Gratitude.</Q></P>

At this Place was convened a Synod in 685, again&s;t the Error of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Churches in the Ob&s;ervance of <HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Battle-edge,</HI> near this Town, <HI>Cuthred,</HI> King of the <HI>We&s;t Saxons,</HI> beat <HI>Ethelbald,</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> in a pitch'd Battle, and threw off his Yoke. The Inhabitants celebrate yearly, on <HI>Mid|&s;ummer-eve,</HI> a kind of Fe&s;tival, which, they &s;ay, commenced in Honour of this Battle. It was here the learned Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> (de&s;cended originally from an antient Family in <HI>Wales</HI>) was born; and the famous Speaker <HI>Lenthal</HI> had a Seat, and died here.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="244">Being &s;o near <HI>Witney,</HI> we could not forbear taking a Ride to &s;ee a Town &s;o famous for the Manufactures of Blanketing and Rugs, which thrive here in a mo&s;t extraordinary manner. Here are at work 150 Looms continually, for which above 3000 People, from Eight Years old and upward, are daily imploy'd in Carding, Spinning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and con&s;ume above 100 Packs of Wool weekly. The Blankets are u&s;ually 10 or 12 Quarters wide, and very white, which &s;ome attribute to the ab&s;ter&s;ive nitrous Waters of the River <HI>Windru&s;h,</HI> wherewith they are &s;coured; but others believe it is owing to a peculiar way of loo&s;e Spinning they u&s;e here; and others again are of Opinion, that it proceeds from both. But however that be, this Town has engro&s;&s;ed the whole Trade in that Commodity, and increa&s;es daily in its Repu|tation. They likewi&s;e make here the <HI>Duffield</HI> Stuffs, a Yard and three Quarters wide, which are carried to <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> and now much worn even here in Winter. Here are likewi&s;e a great many Fellmongers, who having dre&s;&s;ed and &s;tained their Sheep-&s;kins, make them into Jackets and Breeches, and &s;ell them at <HI>Bampton</HI>; from whence they are di&s;per&s;ed all over the neighbouring Counties. Here is a good Free-&s;chool, and a fine Library be|longing to it.</P>
<P><HI>Witney</HI> is an antient Town, and of good Repute before the Conque&s;t; but it is a long, &s;traggling, un|couth Place, tho' full of Inhabitants. 'Twas one of the Manors which <HI>Alwinus,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> gave to the Church of <HI>St. Swithin</HI>'s there, on Queen <HI>Emma</HI>'s happily pa&s;&s;ing over the <HI>Fire Ordeal.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>A&s;tal,</HI> a Village in the Road between <HI>Burford</HI> and <HI>Witney,</HI> is a Barrow which &s;tands very high, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Sepulchre of &s;ome Per&s;on of great Note.</P>
<P>Southward lies <HI>Bampton,</HI> on the Borders of the County next <HI>Berk&s;hire.</HI> It is an antient Market-town,
<PB N="244" REF="245">
likewi&s;e in Repute before the Conque&s;t: it is noted for the greate&s;t Market for Fellmonger-wares in <HI>England,</HI> which come from <HI>Witney,</HI> and for nothing el&s;e that I know of, &s;aving that the People talk'd much of a Family of the <HI>Woods</HI> (that dwelt here and at <HI>Bri&s;enorton</HI>) who hear always a great Knocking before any of them die.</P>
<P>Turning here We&s;t, we enter'd <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> again, and came to <HI>Lechlade,</HI> which lies on the great Road to <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI> It is probable, that it was antiently a <HI>Roman</HI> Town upon the <HI>Thames</HI>; for a very plain <HI>Roman</HI> Road runs from hence to <HI>Cirence&s;ter.</HI> Some &s;ay, that it was once a famous Univer&s;ity for teaching <HI>Latin,</HI> as <HI>Creeklade</HI> was for <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>The antient Building lately di&s;covered by digging in a Meadow near <HI>Lechlade,</HI> de&s;erves a particular Mention: it is 50 Feet long, 40 broad, and Four high; &s;upported with 100 Brick Pillars, curiou&s;ly inlaid with Stones of divers Colours, of Te&s;&s;eraick Work; and &s;uppo&s;ed to be a <HI>Roman</HI> Bath.</P>
<P>Not far from it are the Two Towns called <HI>Sarney</HI>; &s;o named, in <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> from the <HI>Roman</HI> Cau&s;ways; for <HI>Sarn,</HI> in that antient Language, and at pre&s;ent, imports a paved Way. The River <HI>Lech</HI> runs thro' it, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the <HI>Thames.</HI> A great Num|ber of Barges go from hence to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Lechlade</HI> we proceeded We&s;t to <HI>Fairford,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town, thro' which runs the River <HI>Coln,</HI> which has Two large Bridges over it. A great many Medals and Urns have been often dug up here, and there are &s;everal Barrows in the adjoining Fields, (which &s;eem to have been a Scene of warlike Actions) the Monuments of the Slain interred here.</P>
<P>A great many Charities are &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in this Town; but what it is mo&s;t noted for is its Church, and the admirable Painting in its Windows: of which take the following De&s;cription and Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="246"><HI>John Tame,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>London,</HI> purcha&s;ed this Manor of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. (to whom it de&s;cended from the <HI>Beauchamps,</HI> Earls of <HI>Warwick</HI>) and have|ing taken a Prize-&s;hip bound for <HI>Rome,</HI> wherein he found a great Quantity of painted Gla&s;s, he brought both the Gla&s;s and the Workmen into <HI>England.</HI> The Gla&s;s was &s;uch a Curio&s;ity, that Mr. <HI>Tame</HI> built this Church at <HI>Fairford</HI> (dedicating it to the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>); which is in Length 125 Feet, and 55 in Breadth; and has Three Chancels, a good Ve&s;try, and a noble Tower, ari&s;ing from the Mid&s;t of it, adorned with Pinacles; and the Windows of the Church, 28 in Number, he cau&s;ed to be glazed with this invaluable Prize, which remains intire to this Day, the Admiration of all that &s;ee it.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Farmer</HI> (a Daughter of the Lord <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI>) gave 200<HI>l.</HI> to be laid out in mending and wiring the Windows: this has pre&s;erved them from Acci|dents. And in the grand Rebellion, the Impropriator Mr. <HI>Oldworth,</HI> and others, (to their great Prai&s;e be it remembred) took down the Gla&s;s, and &s;ecured it in &s;ome &s;ecret Place, thereby pre&s;erving it from Fa|natick Rage. The Painting was the De&s;ign of <HI>Albert Durer,</HI> a famous <HI>Italian</HI> Ma&s;ter; and the Colouring in the Drapery, and &s;ome of the Figures, is &s;o well perform'd, that <HI>Vandyke</HI> affirmed, the Pencil could not exceed it.</P>
<P>The Subject is all Scripture Hi&s;tory, <HI>viz.</HI> The Ser|pent tempting <HI>Eve</HI>; God appearing in the burning Bu&s;h to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when a Shepherd; the Angel con|ducting <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to War; <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Fleece; the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI>'s Vi&s;it to <HI>Solomon</HI>; King <HI>David</HI> judging the <HI>Amalekite</HI> Regicide; <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> &s;laying the <HI>Phi|li&s;tines,</HI> killing the Lion, and his being betray'd by <HI>Dalilah</HI>; <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Judgment between the Two Harlots; and the Figures of the Twelve Major Prophets.</P>

<P>I have been as brief as po&s;&s;ible in this De&s;cription, being &s;o much confined in my Limits; but a curious Traveller will be highly delighted with this noble Work. And I &s;hall only add, That <HI>John Tame,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the pious and worthy Founder, who died in the Year 1500, lies buried on the North Side of the Church, under a rai&s;ed Marble Monument.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Churn,</HI> one of the Rivers I have ju&s;t named, &s;tands <HI>Cirence&s;ter,</HI> (or <HI>Cice&s;ter,</HI> for Brevity) the antient <HI>Corinium</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and &s;aid to be rebuilt by <HI>Ci&s;&s;a,</HI> a Viceroy under one of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, a great and populous City; then inclo&s;ed with Walls and a Ditch of va&s;t Compa&s;s, which may be traced quite round. The Foundation of the Wall is al&s;o very vi&s;ible in mo&s;t Places. A good Part of this Circuit is now Pa&s;ture, Corn Fields, and Gardens, be&s;ides the Scite of the pre&s;ent Town. Antiquities are dug up here every Day; old Foundations, Hou&s;es and Streets, and many <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Pavements with Rings, Intaglia's, and Coins innumerable, e&s;pecially in one great Garden called <HI>Lewis Grounds,</HI> which might have been the <HI>Praetorium</HI> or General's Quarters; for <HI>Llys,</HI> in <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> &s;ignifies a Palace. Large Quantities of carved Stones are carried off yearly in Carts, to mend the Highways, be&s;ides what have been u&s;ed in Building. A fine <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Pavement was dug up here <HI>Anno</HI> 1723, with many Coins. One Mr. <HI>Richard Bi&s;hop</HI> lately dug up in his Garden a Vault 16 Feet long, and 12 broad, &s;upported with &s;quare Pillars of <HI>Roman</HI> Brick, three Feet and an half high, on which was a &s;trong Floor of Terrace.
<PB N="248" REF="249">
Near it are now &s;everal other Vaults, on which Cherry-trees grow. The&s;e might have been the Foundations of a Temple; for in the &s;ame Place they found &s;everal Stones of the Shafts of Pillars Six Feet long, and large Stone Ba&s;es, with Cornices very hand&s;omely moulded, and carved with Modilions and other Ornaments, which are now converted into Swine-troughs, and Pavements before the Door. Capitals of the&s;e Pillars were likewi&s;e found. A <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Pavement near it, and intire, is now the Floor of his Privy.</P>
<P>Half a Mile We&s;t of the Town, on the North Side of the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e</HI> Road, at a Place called <HI>Quern,</HI> other Antiquities are to be &s;een worth an Antiquary's Attention; but I mu&s;t not take up too much Room in de&s;cribing them.</P>
<P>Little of the Abbey is now le&s;t, be&s;ides Two old and indifferent Gate-hou&s;es. The Church is a very hand&s;ome Building; the Windows are full of painted Gla&s;s; and it has a fine lofty Tower. Ea&s;t of the Town, about a Quarter of a Mile, is <HI>Starbury Mount,</HI> a Barrow, where <HI>Roman</HI> Coins have been dug up. We&s;t, behind Lord <HI>Bathur&s;t</HI>'s Garden, is <HI>Gri&s;mund</HI>'s <HI>Mount,</HI> of which &s;everal Fables are told.</P>
<P><HI>Cirence&s;ter</HI> is &s;till a very good Town, populous and rich, full of Clothiers, and driving a great Trade in Wool, which is brought from the Inland Counties of <HI>Leice&s;ter, Northampton,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> where the large&s;t Sheep in <HI>England</HI> feed, and where are but few Manufactures. The va&s;t Quantities &s;old here are almo&s;t incredible. The Wool is bought up here, chiefly by the Clothiers of <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire,</HI> for the Supply of that great Cloathing-trade, which I have mentioned already: they talk of 5000 Packs in a Year.</P>
<P>The Town is governed by Two High Con&s;tables. It has Two weekly Markets; one on <HI>Monday,</HI> for Corn, Cattle, and Provi&s;ions; and on <HI>Friday,</HI> for
<PB N="249" REF="250">
Wool chiefly. It has al&s;o Five Fairs, Three for all Sorts of Commodities, and Two for Cloth only. Here is a fine large beautiful Church with Two Ayles, &s;upported by &s;trong Pillars. The Chancel is hand&s;omely decorated. It has Five Chapels adjoin|ing to it, and has a Tower very neat and lofty, with an excellent Ring of Bells in it. The Windows &s;hew &s;ome beautiful Remains of exqui&s;ite painted Gla&s;s. There is a Free-&s;chool, and divers Ho&s;pitals and Alms-hou&s;es in this Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>The <HI>Churn</HI> runs from hence down Southward to <HI>Creeklade</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> which is &s;aid to have been antiently a very noted Place, containing 1300 Hou&s;es, and that an Univer&s;ity was here founded by the antient <HI>Britons,</HI> for teaching <HI>Greek,</HI> as I have &s;aid, as <HI>Lech|lade</HI> was for <HI>Latin</HI>; which Univer&s;ity was removed, as they pretend, by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> to <HI>Oxon:</HI> but, I doubt, the&s;e are Monki&s;h Accounts; for <HI>Creeklade,</HI> which they would have to &s;ignify a <HI>Greek</HI> Town, is a Corruption of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Word <HI>Kerigg gwlade,</HI> i. e. a &s;tony Country. The <HI>Churn</HI> and the <HI>Rey</HI> fall, here, into the <HI>Thames.</HI> Here is a good Free-&s;chool.</P>
<P>North-we&s;t of <HI>Cirence&s;ter,</HI> upon a Hill, &s;tands <HI>Stroud,</HI> a little Market-town, noted for Clothing, and particularly for dying excellent Scarlet. The Church is 90 Feet long, and 40 broad. The Chancel is 33 Feet long, and 16 wide. At the We&s;t End of the Church ri&s;es a high Spire Steeple, and a Tower in the Middle.</P>
<P>North of it &s;tands <HI>Payn&s;wick,</HI> a Market-town, &s;ituate in the whol&s;ome&s;t Air in the County, on the River <HI>Stroud,</HI> where the Cloathing-trade is al&s;o car|ried on. The Church is a Vicarage, and very hand&s;ome, with Two Chancels, a North Ayle, and a neat Spire.</P>
<P>Lower to the South-we&s;t of <HI>Cirence&s;ter</HI> &s;tands <HI>Minching Hampton</HI>; &s;o called, becau&s;e it belonged to the <HI>Minching</HI> Nuns at <HI>Caen</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> Here
<PB N="250" REF="251">
is a good Rectory Church worth 200<HI>l.</HI> a Year, large, in the Form of a Cro&s;s with Ayles on each Side, and a Tower with Battlements ri&s;ing in the Middle. In the North Ayle are a great many In&s;criptions of Be|nefactions. And in the South Ayle is a Statue lying cro&s;s-legg'd, with a Sword and Shield by him, and his Wife lying at his Feet.</P>
<P>Then we came to <HI>Tetbury,</HI> one of the Cloathing Towns I mentioned; a con&s;iderable Market-town, &s;ituate on a ri&s;ing Ground, in a healthy Air, but &s;carce of Water in Summer. 'Tis well-built, has a large Market-hou&s;e well frequented for Yarn; and there is a le&s;&s;er Market-hou&s;e, for Chee&s;e, Bacon, and other Commodities. 'Tis govern'd by a Bailiff, and at the End of the Town is a long Bridge, whereof one half is in <HI>Wilt&s;hire.</HI> The Church is a Vicarage, worth 120<HI>l.</HI> a Year: 'tis a good Build|ing, large and hand&s;ome, in which are divers Monu|ments. Here is a Free-&s;chool and an Alms-hou&s;e. It had formerly a Ca&s;tle built by <HI>Dunwallo Malmu|fius,</HI> a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Prince. The Town &s;eems to be well furni&s;hed with every thing but Water, which is &s;o &s;carce, that the Inhabitants are obliged to buy it at the Rate &s;ometimes of 18<HI>d.</HI> for a Hog&s;head. In this Pari&s;h ri&s;es the River <HI>Avon,</HI> which runs thro' <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and afterwards falls into the <HI>Severn.</HI></P>
<P>A little to the North of this Town is a Meadow called <HI>Maudlin</HI> Meadow, becau&s;e, as I was told, it belongs to <HI>Magdalen</HI> College in <HI>Oxford.</HI> Here the Inhabitants &s;hewed me the Head of a Spring, which flowing from thence runs along a Hedge-trough, and &s;ome Tops of the Wood, that grows in the Hedge, rotting, and falling into this Rill of Water, are, by it, turned into Stone. I took up a great many of them, which are generally in the Shape of the Pipes (as they are commonly called) which the Peruke-makers curl their Hair upon, and of a whiti&s;h &s;tony Sub&s;tance. I broke divers of them, and in the
<PB N="251" REF="252">
middle found generally a Stick of Wood, &s;ome as big as a Goo&s;e-quill, others larger; &s;ome had but a thin &s;tony Cru&s;t about them, in others the Stick was no biggar than a large Needle: again, &s;ome had no Stick in them, but only a Hole thro' them, like that of a Tobacco Pipe; and in &s;ome others, I could per|ceive no woody Sub&s;tance, nor Hole at all, but the Whole was a &s;oft Kind of Stone.&mdash;Hence I gue&s;s, that the Sand which the Water brings down with it, gathers and cru&s;ts about tho&s;e Sticks; and that, in time, the Stick con&s;umes, and the &s;tony or &s;andy Sub&s;tance fills up and &s;upplies its Place. And I would hence recommend it as an Inquiry, Whether tho&s;e other Tran&s;mutations of this Kind, that we meet with in the Natural Hi&s;tory of this and other Nations, be not brought about in the like manner.</P>
<P>And now I am dipp'd into this Work of Nature, let me digre&s;s a little, and take notice of the <HI>A&s;troites,</HI> or Star-&s;tones, found at <HI>La&s;&s;ington</HI> in this County, which have that peculiar Quality of Motion when put into Vinegar.&mdash;In the Fields, near <HI>Badminton,</HI> are found cylindrical and &s;pherical Stones, almo&s;t as big as Cannon Balls. And on the Hills about <HI>Aldely,</HI> are found Stones of the &s;ame Kind with tho&s;e I found about <HI>Watchet</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> re&s;embling all Kinds of Shell-fi&s;h: the&s;e, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, are, of the two, more a&s;toni&s;hing, becau&s;e they are found on the Hills; for if they were, as <HI>Fraca&s;torius</HI> conjectures, Animals ingendered in the Sea, no good Account of their being here found can be given, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e them brought hither by the general Deluge.&mdash;The Water of the River <HI>Stroud,</HI> in this County, is e&s;teemed the be&s;t for Dying Scarlets, which draws many Clothiers to &s;ettle in that Neigh|bourhood. And le&s;t I &s;hould be thought too tedious, let me but ju&s;t mention the Diamonds (<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Stones rather) found near the Banks of the River <HI>Avon.</HI> That &s;oft, ea&s;y-to-be-wrought Stone at <HI>Great Ban|ington,</HI>

<P><HI>Wickwar,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town, but a very an|tient Corporation, governed by a Mayor, is the next. The Church is a large Edifice, with Two Chancels. The Tower is at the We&s;t End, and is high, adorn'd with Pinacles. Here is a Free-&s;chool.</P>
<P><HI>Chipping Sodbury</HI> lies a little farther in the Road, an antient Borough-town, under a Mayor, Aldermen and Burge&s;&s;es. As it is a great Thorough-fare to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> it is full of good Inns. It has &s;everal Streets be&s;ides Lanes, and a good Market; and a large &s;pa|cious Church, which, however, is but a Chapel of Ea&s;e to <HI>Old Sodbury.</HI> Here is the greate&s;t Chee&s;e-market in <HI>England,</HI> except <HI>Ather&s;tone</HI> in <HI>War|wick&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>Here we dropp'd the Road, and fell down South|ward, directly to <HI>Mar&s;hfield,</HI> another of the Cloath|ing Towns I &s;poke of. It con&s;i&s;ts of one Street of old Buildings near a Mile long. It has a Market, and drives al&s;o a great Trade in Malt, and is noted for good Cakes. 'Tis governed by a Bailiff. Here is a good Vicarage Church, with &s;everal Monuments and In&s;criptions in the Ayles, and the Chancel. Here is an Alms-hou&s;e well endow'd, and a Chapel to it.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed the great Road from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> here, as at <HI>Cirence&s;ter</HI> we did that from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>; and keeping &s;till the Fo&s;&s;eway, arrived at <HI>Bath.</HI> But here I &s;hall conclude this Letter, and am, Sir,</P>

<P><HI>Bath</HI> is a Spot of Ground, which our Countrymen ought to e&s;teem as a particular Favour of Heaven. It lies in a great Valley, &s;urrounded with an Amphi|theatrical View of Hills; and its Situation on the We&s;t Side of the I&s;land is a con&s;iderable Addition to its Delights, as being the le&s;s liable to the rude Shocks of
<PB N="254" REF="255">
Tempe&s;ts. But the <HI>Romans</HI> were induced prudently to make a Station here by the admirable hot Springs. The Walls are almo&s;t intire, and perhaps the Work of the <HI>Romans,</HI> except the upper Part, which &s;eems repaired with the Ruins of <HI>Roman</HI> Buildings; for the Lewis-holes are &s;till left in many of the Stones, and, to the Shame of the Repairers, many <HI>Roman</HI> In|&s;criptions, &s;ome &s;awn acro&s;s, to fit the Size of the Place. The Level of the City is ri&s;en to the Top of the fir&s;t Walls, thro' the Negligence of the Magi&s;tracy, who, in this, and all other great Towns, connive at the Servants throwing Dirt and A&s;hes into the Streets. The&s;e Walls inclo&s;e but a &s;mall Com|pa&s;s, of a pentagonal Form. There are four Gates on four Sides, and a Po&s;tern on the other. From the South-we&s;t Angle have been an additional Wall and Ditch carried out to the River; by which &s;hort Work the Approach of an Enemy on two Sides is intercepted, unle&s;s they pa&s;s the River. The &s;mall Compa&s;s of the City has made the Inhabitants croud up the Streets to an un&s;eemly and inconvenient Narrowne&s;s. It is, however, hand&s;omely built, mo&s;tly of new Stone, which is very white and good. The great Additions made, and &s;till making, to the Buildings here, I &s;hall mention by-and-by.</P>
<P>It was of old a Re&s;ort for Cripples, and di&s;|ea&s;ed Per&s;ons; and we &s;ee the Crutches hang up at the &s;everal Baths, as the Thank-offerings of tho&s;e who came hither lame, and went away cured. But now we may &s;ay it is a Re&s;ort of the Sound, as well as the Sick, and a Place that helps the Indolent and the Gay to commit that wor&s;t of Murders, that is to &s;ay, to kill <HI>Time.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;uch it is indeed a con&s;tant Round of Diver|&s;ion. In the Morning the young Lady is brought in a clo&s;e Chair, dre&s;&s;ed in her Bathing-cloaths, to the <HI>Cro&s;s-bath.</HI> There the Mu&s;ick plays her into the Bath, and the Women who tend her, pre&s;ent her
<PB N="255" REF="256">
with a little floating Wooden Di&s;h, like a Ba&s;on; in which the Lady puts a Handkerchief, and a No&s;egay, and of late the Snuff-box is added. She then traver&s;es the Bath, if a Novice, with a Guide; if otherwi&s;e, by her&s;elf; and having amus'd her&s;elf near an Hour, calls for her Chair, and re|turns to her Lodgings.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Diver&s;ion is at Mrs. <HI>Hayes</HI>'s, for|merly <HI>Harri&s;on</HI>'s, a &s;tately Room, and Mrs. <HI>Wilt|&s;hire</HI>'s, who has now the Apartments that were the late Mrs. <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI>'s, where not long &s;ince was the Bowling-green. And perhaps Mr. <HI>Leake,</HI> who keeps one of the fine&s;t Book&s;ellers Shops in <HI>Europe,</HI> has more than a Chance for half an Hour of each Per|&s;on's Company now-and-then, and to be &s;ure a Sub&s;cription, which is but five Shillings the Sea&s;on, for taking home what Book you plea&s;e; but Per&s;ons of Quality generally &s;ub&s;cribe Gold, and I think it is the very be&s;t Money laid out in the Place, for tho&s;e who go for Plea&s;ure or Amu&s;ement only. In the Afternoon there is frequently a Play, tho' the Decorations are mean, and indeed the Performances too. In the Evening, People a&s;&s;emble at the great Rooms, and there are Balls twice a Week. 'Tis al&s;o the Fa&s;hion of the Place, for the Company to go every Day pretty con&s;tantly to hear Divine Service at the great Church, and at <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s Chapel in <HI>Queen's-&s;quare,</HI> where are Prayers twice a Day.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable that for many Hundreds of Years, the Medicinal Virtues of the&s;e Waters have been u&s;eful to the di&s;ea&s;ed People by Batheing only; whereas of late Years they are found to be no le&s;s healthful in many Ca&s;es taken inwardly; in&s;omuch, that more come to drink than to bathe; nor are the Cures they perform this way, le&s;s valuable than the outward Application.</P>
<P>Gaming u&s;ed to obtain here, as at all publick Places, to a &s;candalous Degree; but the Act pro|hibiting
<PB N="256" REF="257">
that pernicious Practice; has a good deal checked its Progre&s;s. This Act pa&s;&s;ed in the 12th of King <HI>George</HI> II. and &s;uppre&s;&s;es, on the Penalty of 200<HI>l.</HI> and 50<HI>l.</HI> the Adventures, the following Games by Name; <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Ace of Hearts, Pharaoh, Ba&s;|&s;et, Hazard</HI>; al&s;o all <HI>Sales, Raffles, Lotteries, Mathematical Machines,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Sales by Lotteries</HI> are declared void, and what is put up by them for|feited; nor are Convictions to be vacated for want of Form.</P>
<P>But this Act being eluded by new Games &s;et up, a Clau&s;e was in&s;erted in the <HI>Hor&s;e-racing</HI> Act, <HI>Anno</HI> 13 <HI>Geo.</HI> II. prohibiting <HI>Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> and all other Games with Dice, except what are play'd on the <HI>Back|gamon</HI> Tables.</P>
<P>As to the more particular Nature and Virtues of the Waters, I have been favoured, by a very eminent Phy&s;ician, with the following curious Account of tham, and their Original.<Q><HI>Of</HI> Bath <HI>Waters.</HI>
<P>The <HI>Bath</HI> Waters certainly owe their Heat to a Mixture and Fermentation of two different Sources, di&s;tilling from the Tops of two different Mountains (<HI>Clarton</HI> and <HI>Land&s;down</HI>) meeting in the Valley where the Town &s;tands; for all Hills are Ne&s;ts of Metals or Minerals, and their Bellies are cavernous and hollow. It is not therefore improbable, that on <HI>Clarton Down</HI> there &s;hould lie the &s;ulphurous Matter which mu&s;t ri&s;e by Impregnation from that excellent Stone Quarry, which hardens in the Air, and grows ca&s;ed with a nitrous Coat by Time, and cold Wea|ther, and is &s;o readily cut out and carved into any the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Shapes. This the Di&s;covery and Property of the worthy, charitable, and pious <HI>Ralph Allen,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> For all Mineral Waters owe their Virtue to an Impregnation of Rain Water, generated from the Clouds, which are compre&s;&s;ed in their Cour&s;e by
<PB N="257" REF="258">
Mountains or Eminences, and fall on the re|&s;pective included Mineral. And every one knows, that a due Mixture of Sulphur, and Filings of Iron, moi&s;tened with Water, will produce any Degree of Heat. This Quarry therefore mu&s;t have a large Quantity of &s;ulphurous or bituminous Matter in its Compo&s;ition, as will be evident to a Natural Philo|&s;opher, from the&s;e mentioned Qualities of the Stone. Neither is it improbable, that the ferruginous or iron-tinctured Water takes its Ri&s;e from <HI>Lan&s;down</HI> Quarry, the Stone on it being hard, and on the Top flinty, black, and acrimonious, as Iron Ore is known to be. The&s;e Two Mountains, thus tinged by Rain Water falling from the proper Heights, meet in &s;ome Caverns in the Valley; and, there fermenting produce that hot, milky, &s;oft, &s;alutiferous Beverage, called <HI>Bath Water,</HI> far beyond any hot mineral Waters for its Delicacy, and &s;upportable, tho' comfortable Heat, to any other &s;uch Water hitherto di&s;covered on the habitable Globe, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that Milkine&s;s, Deter|gency, and middling Heat &s;o friendly adapted to weaken'd animal Con&s;titutions, which all other hot Waters want in the due Degree; either being too hot, or too cold, to do any great Good in Ca&s;es where they are proper. The&s;e Waters are beneficial in al|mo&s;t all chronical Di&s;tempers, and can hurt in none, except in Hemorrhages, Inflammations, or bad Lungs, unle&s;s they be over-do&s;ed in Quantity, or too high and too hot a Regimen be joined with them; for they always procure a great Appetite, and good Spirits, if cautiou&s;ly managed; but if high Meats, and &s;trong Liquors, be indulged, they will create inflam|matory Di&s;orders. However, in weak Stomachs, decayed Appetites, Colicks, low Spirits, in the Intervals of the Fits of the Gout and Stone; in Rheumati&s;ms, Pal&s;ies, nervous Di&s;orders; and, in a Word, all tho&s;e called the Cold Di&s;ea&s;es; but mo&s;t eminently, in all the Di&s;orders of the chyliferous Tube,
<PB N="258" REF="259">
or the Stomach and Belly not inflamed, they are more kindly and beneficial than any Medicine known in Nature; and introduce a natural Warmth, and a new internal Heat, into decayed, worn-out, &s;uper|annuated Con&s;titutions; and if a light Regimen, due Exerci&s;e, and good Hours, be joined with them, they would truly work Wonders: but by the Neglect of the&s;e, their Efficacy is often lo&s;t, and their Credit brought into Que&s;tion.</P></Q></P>
<P>Great Additions have been made to the Buildings here within the&s;e few Years; particularly by the Duke of <HI>Chandos.</HI></P>
<P>Without the Walls, a &s;tately new Square is erected, with a fine Chapel, and the Middle is in|clo&s;ed by Rails, and hand&s;omely laid out within.</P>
<P>In the Centre is a lofty Obeli&s;k 70 Feet high from the Foundation, and terminated in a Point. Level with one's Eye is the inclo&s;ed In&s;cription:
<Q>IN MEMORY<LB>OF HONOUR BESTOW'D,<LB>AND IN GRATITUDE<LB>FOR BENEFITS CONFERR'D<LB>IN THIS CITY,<LB>BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS<LB><HI>FREDERICK</HI><LB><HI>PRINCE</HI> OF <HI>WALES,</HI><LB>AND HIS ROYAL <HI>CONSORT,</HI><LB>IN THE YEAR M.DCC.XXXVIII.<LB>THIS OBELISK IS ERECTED,<LB>BY <HI>RICHARD NASH,</HI> <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Bath-&s;tone,</HI> which I have mention'd before, affords a fine Opportunity to imbelli&s;h and give a noble Look to the Buildings here, and at a very cheap Rate; for the Front of the Hou&s;es on the North Side of the Square co&s;t no more than 500<HI>l.</HI> tho' it is above 200 Feet in Extent, and inriched with Co|lumns
<PB N="259" REF="260">
and Pila&s;ters in the <HI>Corinthian Order.</HI> All the Danger is, that they will over-build them&s;elves now they are got into the Humour, and make it le&s;s worth while to tho&s;e who let Lodgings, the prin|cipal Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Place; but then People of Fortune, &s;ettling there, will make amends for it; &s;ince no le&s;s than 70 or 80 Families are already be|come con&s;tant Inhabitants, and others are daily taking Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Grove too, near the Abbey-church, now cal|led <HI>Orange-&s;quare,</HI> in Compliment to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> when there, has &s;everal hand&s;ome new-built Hou&s;es; and a monumental Stone is erected, with an In&s;cription in Honour to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Place; his Highne&s;s having been obliged to vi&s;it <HI>Bath</HI> for his Health, ju&s;t before he married the Prince&s;s Royal of <HI>England,</HI> and received great Benefit by the Waters. This likewi&s;e was erected by the famous Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> to who&s;e good Management and Behaviour <HI>Bath</HI> is greatly indebted; every one &s;ubmitting with Delight to the Regulations he impo&s;es, with regard to Decorum, and the Oeconomy of the Place.</P>
<P>The In&s;cription on the Stone above, is as follows:<Q><HI>In Memoriam</HI><LB><HI>Sanitatis</HI><LB><HI>Principi Auriaco</HI><LB><HI>Aquarum Thermalium Potu,</HI><LB><HI>Favente DEO,</HI><LB><HI>Ovante</HI> BRITANNIA,<LB><HI>Feliciter Re&s;titutae.</HI><LB>M.DCC.XXXV.</Q> <HI>Thus tran&s;lated:</HI><Q>In Memory of the happy Re&s;to|ration of the Health of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> by the drink|ing of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, thro' the Favour of GOD, and to the extreme Joy of <HI>Britain,</HI> 1735.</Q></P>
<P>General <HI>Wade,</HI> one of the Repre&s;entatives in Par|liament for this City, has given a fine Altar-piece to the great Church there: He has al&s;o been at the Charge of having the Picture drawn of every one of his Electors, (the Members of the Corporation) and &s;et up round the Town-hall; and his own too he has
<PB N="260" REF="261">
&s;uffer'd to be put up over the Entrance, as if he would make good that Pa&s;s, and keep them all to <HI>Duty.</HI> At the Upper-end of the Hall are lately &s;et up the Pictures of the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Wales,</HI> a Pre&s;ent made by their Royal Highne&s;&s;es to the Cor|poration, who likewi&s;e before pre&s;ented it with a fine large wrought Silver Cup and Waiter, gilt.</P>
<P>There is a very great Narrowne&s;s of Spirit in mo&s;t of the Inhabitants at <HI>Bath:</HI> but, indeed, it is the &s;ame in all publick Places of Re&s;ort. They have but their <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI>; and they are &s;o hungry by that time they come about, that they look upon a new Comer, as a Per&s;on to be <HI>&s;hared</HI> and <HI>divided</HI> among them: for this Rea&s;on you'll always find them with <HI>both</HI> Hands open to <HI>receive</HI>; and not <HI>one</HI> to <HI>com|municate,</HI> or do a <HI>generous</HI> Office, without a Benefit in <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>Rever&s;ion.</HI> And when they receive a Favour at your Hands, 'tis with &s;uch an Air, as if it were their <HI>Due,</HI> and they quitted Scores with you by their Acceptance of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abbey-church</HI> is a venerable Pile, and has many Monuments in it. But the principal Front is almo&s;t bla&s;phemou&s;ly decorated, if it may be call'd decorated, with the Figures of God the Father, and Saints and Angels, the Work of Super&s;tition. This Cathedral, tho' beautiful, is but &s;mall; and on the Spot probably &s;tood the <HI>Roman</HI> Temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> Patrone&s;s of the Baths. Before it, was an hand|&s;ome &s;quare Area, but of late Years deformed with Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>On the South Side are the ju&s;tly renowned hot Springs collected into a &s;quare Area, called <HI>the King's Bath.</HI> The Corporation erected within the&s;e few Years that pretty neat Building before it, call'd <HI>the Pump-room,</HI> for the Company to meet in, who drink the Water, convey'd hither by a Marble Pump from the Bottom of the Springs, where it is near boiling-hot.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262">This Water is admirably grateful to the Stomach, &s;triking the Roof of the Mouth with a fine &s;ulphur|ous and &s;teely Ta&s;te, like that of the <HI>German Spaw</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont.</HI> Tho' you drink off a large Pint-gla&s;s, it is &s;o far from creating a Heavine&s;s or Nau&s;ea, that you immediately perceive your&s;elf more alert. At fir&s;t it operates by Stool, and e&s;pecially Urine. It is of &s;overeign Efficacy to &s;trengthen the Bowels, re|&s;tore their lo&s;t Tone, and renew the vital Heat. But I have already mention'd its excellent Qualities.</P>
<P><HI>The King's Bath</HI> is an oblong Square, the Walls full of Niches, perhaps the <HI>Romans</HI> Work. There are Twelve on the North Side; Eight on the Ea&s;t and We&s;t; about Four larger Arches on the South. At every Corner are the Steps to de&s;cend into it, and a Parapet or Balu&s;trade with a Walk round it.</P>
<P>The Springs were doubtle&s;s &s;eparated from com|mon Springs by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and fenced in with a durable Wall. There goes a probable Tradition of &s;ubterranean Canals of their making, to carry off the other Waters, le&s;t they &s;hould mix with the&s;e, and de&s;troy the Heat.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that at the clean&s;ing of the Springs, when they &s;et down a new Pump, they con&s;tantly find great Quantities of Hazel-nuts, as in many other Places among &s;ubterraneous Timber. The&s;e, Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> doubts not, are the Remainder of the univer|&s;al Deluge, which the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Hi&s;torian tell us was in Autumn, Providence by that means &s;ecuring the Revival of the Vegetable World.</P>
<P>In the Bath People &s;tand up to the Chin, Men and Women, and &s;tew, mo&s;tly in the way of Gallantry.</P>
<P>Many are the Di&s;ea&s;es which here find a Remedy, when judiciou&s;ly applied, as I ob&s;erv'd above. The Confleunce hither is greater in Summer, than in Winter, tho' the latter, of the two, &s;eems the more preferable Sea&s;on for medicinal Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">Behind the Southern Wall of <HI>the King's Bath,</HI> is a le&s;s Square, named <HI>the Queen's Bath,</HI> with a Ta|bernacle of Four Pillars in the mid&s;t. This is of more temperate Warmth, as borrowing its Water from the other. There are likewi&s;e Pumps and Pumping-rooms, for pouring hot Streams on any Part of the Body; which in many Ca&s;es is very &s;alutary.</P>
<P>In the South-we&s;t Part of the Town are two other Baths, not to be di&s;regarded.</P>
<P><HI>The Hot-bath</HI> is not much inferior in Heat to <HI>the King's Bath</HI>; it is a &s;mall Parallelogram, with a Stone Tabernacle of Four Pillars in the mid&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>The Cro&s;s-bath</HI> near it is triangular, and had a Cro&s;s in the middle. Hard by is an Ho&s;pital built and endow'd by a Prelate of this See. The Water in the&s;e two Places ri&s;es near the Level of the Streets.</P>
<P>On the South Side of the Cathedral are &s;ome Parts of the Abbey left, and the Gate-hou&s;e belonging to it.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e few Years, by a Contribution, a cold Bath for the Benefit of the Infirm was made at a Spring beyond the Bridge.</P>
<P>Two <HI>Roman</HI> In&s;criptions have been &s;et in the Ea&s;tern Wall of the Cathedral, fronting the Walks; which, be&s;ides the Injuries of the Weather, are expo&s;ed to the mi&s;chievous Sport of Boys, who throw Stones at them.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Baths are very indifferently kept, as their U&s;e &s;o much increa&s;es. But a fine De&s;ign is now on foot to make convenient Slips, with Dre&s;&s;ing-rooms, and Apartments for Pumping on People, without going into the Bath, and for inlarging the Pump-room &s;o as to hold four or five Pumps.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Decency is ob&s;erved here by both Sexes; and while Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> lives, it mu&s;t be always &s;o. There is a very good Conveniency of Chairs, of which there are great Plenty, and very genteel ones,
<PB N="263" REF="264">
to go to any Part within the Walls, and even to the adjoining Buildings without, for 6<HI>d.</HI> provided the Di&s;tance does not exceed 500 Yards; but if it does, the Fare is 1<HI>s.</HI> and for this the Chairmen are obliged to go a Mile. In &s;hort, it is a delightful Place enough, when you are in it, but a dreadful one to come at, down high Hills, in &s;ome Places like Precipices: but Health or Plea&s;ure obliges People to di&s;pen&s;e with this Difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Bath</HI> being invironed with Hills, there are few plea&s;ant Walks out of the Town, or even Rides, without clambering much to <HI>Land&s;down-hill,</HI> or that called <HI>Clarton-down.</HI></P>
<P>It is for this Rea&s;on, that very few People care to keep Coaches here. And the Hill up to <HI>Lan&s;down,</HI> particularly, is &s;o &s;teep, that the late Queen <HI>Anne</HI> was extremely frighted in going up: her Coachman &s;topping to give the Hor&s;es Breath, and the Coach wanting a Drag&s;taff, it ran back in &s;pite of all the Coachman's Skill; the Hor&s;es not being brought to &s;train the Harne&s;s again, or pull together for a good while, and the Coach putting the Guards behind in great Confu&s;ion: at la&s;t &s;ome of the Servants, &s;etting their Heads and Shoulders to the Wheels, &s;topt them by mere Force.</P>
<P>The General Ho&s;pital now near fini&s;hed in this City, for the Reception of the &s;ick Poor all over the Kingdom, is a very noble De&s;ign. The fir&s;t Stone of it was laid the 6th of <HI>July</HI> 1738. It is built where the old Play-hou&s;e &s;tood, and is a noble Pile of Building, 100 Feet in Front, and 90 Feet deep. It is capable of receiving 150 poor Cripples. Its chief Benefactor is Mr. <HI>Allen,</HI> of whom we &s;hall &s;ay more anon, who gave all the Wall-&s;tone, Free-&s;tone ready wrought, Paving-&s;tone, and Lime u&s;ed in it. The Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Wales</HI> have like|wi&s;e been great Promoters of the Work.</P>

<P><PB N="264" REF="271">A very great De&s;ign is now al&s;o begun in this City, of which the following is a brief Account.</P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>March</HI> 1739-40, the fir&s;t Stone of a new Square was laid, in the Gardens adjoining to the publick Walks. The principal Side of this Square is to have the Appearance of one Hou&s;e, 520 Feet in Front, and 260 Feet in Depth, but is to be divided into 40 Hou&s;es: each Front is to have 63 Windows, and each End 31. Two of the other Sides are to &s;erve as Wings to the principal Side: each Wing is to contain 24 Hou&s;es upon a perfect Square of 210 Feet, and the Front of the&s;e Wings are every one to have 25 Windows; &s;o that when the whole Building is viewed in Front, it will &s;hew 113 Windows, extend 1040 Feet, and from the di&s;tant Hills look like one grand Palace. The three Piles of Building will be adorned with above 300 Columns and Pila&s;ters in the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order:&mdash;Upon the Corner of every Pile there will be a Tower, and in every Front will be a Centre-hou&s;e and a Pediment.</P>
<P>A noble Hou&s;e for publick A&s;&s;emblies is to be erected by Sub&s;cription in this Square; the Ball|room will be like an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Hall, and contain in Length 90 Feet, and Breadth 52 Feet. The A&s;|&s;embly-room will be 90 Feet long. There will be a Garden for the Ladies to walk in; a Bowling-green for the Gentlemen; a grand Parade of 200 Yards long, a Terrace 500 Yards in Circumference, a Portico of the &s;ame Dimen&s;ions, with divers other Walks in common for all People, and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that Gentlemen and Ladies may walk at any Sea&s;on of the Year, at any Hour of the Day, and in any Weather. So that by the&s;e great Improvements <HI>Bath</HI> will be rendered one of the mo&s;t agreeable Places in the World; for, facing this Square, a Bridge with an Arch of 102 Feet opening will be built over the River, by which People of Di&s;tinction may go to
<PB N="265" REF="272">
the <HI>Downs,</HI> as into their own Gardens, for the Air and Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Avon</HI> runs by the Back of the Town; and on the Banks of it, Mr. <HI>Allen,</HI> who is the Genius of the Place, and who&s;e Works and In|ventions there, next to the Waters, are better worth the Attention of the Curious, than any thing in <HI>Bath,</HI> has a fine Wharf, and other convenient Places, to &s;hape, to work, to imbark the Stones of many Tons Weight, which he digs from the Quarry, on the adjacent Hill. This he does by an admirable Machine, which runs down the Hill by Grooves placed in the Ground, without Hor&s;es or any other Help, than one Man to guide it, who al&s;o by a particular Spring can &s;top it in the &s;teepe&s;t Part of the Hill, and in the &s;wifte&s;t Part of its Motion. The&s;e Stones he can carry by the <HI>Avon</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> whence they may be tran&s;ported to any other Part of <HI>England</HI>; and the new Works of <HI>St. Bartholomew's</HI> Ho&s;pital, <HI>London,</HI> are built with them. He is build|ing for him&s;elf a very magnificent Hou&s;e of this Stone, with a fine Chapel, and noble Stables and Offices; and has delightful Gardens laid out with a Profu&s;ion of Fancy, yet with great Oeconomy, as to the Expence: for, in &s;hort, Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> is con|tented with the Situation of his Hou&s;e and Gardens, (and indeed well he may, for it is a very fine one) and, in&s;tead of forcing Nature by a great Expence to bend to Art, he pur&s;ues only what the natural Scite points out to him, and, by &s;o doing, will make it one of the cheape&s;t, and at the &s;ame time one of the mo&s;t beautiful Seats in <HI>England.</HI> He levels no Hills, but enjoys the Beauty of the Pro&s;pects they afford; he cuts down no Woods, but &s;trikes thro' them fine Walks, and next-to-natural Mazes; and has, by that means, a delightful Grove always filled with Birds, which afford the rural Ear a Mu&s;ick tran&s;cending all others. Nor does he want for fine Conveniencies

of Water; and as he is a Gentleman who is not enter'd into the pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable Schemes of ridi|culing Religion and Scripture, he has a Figure of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;triking the Rock, and the Water gu&s;hing out of it, which forms a &s;ort of natural Ca&s;cade, whence his Ba&s;on is &s;upplied; and is a pretty Allu&s;ion to his producing all his Works from the Stone Quarry in his Neighbourhood.

An old Elm-Tree, &s;tanding near <HI>Stanton-Drew,</HI> in a Road leading three Ways, afforded a &s;ad Te&s;timony of the Event of the Duke's Enterprize; for it was all over&s;pread with the Heads and Limbs of the unfortunate Per&s;ons engag'd in his Cau&s;e, who &s;uffer'd by the Sentence of the mercile&s;s <HI>Jefferies.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>Twyfordton,</HI> not far from <HI>Bath,</HI> is a fallow Field, call'd <HI>Mar&s;bury-Field,</HI> with but little Quan|tity of Earth upon the Rock. This was very full of fo&s;&s;ile Shells, which had pre&s;erv'd their natural Colour of Blue and White as perfectly as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>In <HI>Chu</HI> Pari&s;h is <HI>Bowditch,</HI> &s;o call'd from its cir|cular Form; it was a large Camp on a Hill trebly fortified, whence you may behold the I&s;les of <HI>Flat|holm</HI> and <HI>Steepholm</HI> in the Sea. Here is a petrifying Spring. This Country abounds with Coal-pits. The Slates which lie upon it, and have not re|ceiv'd their due Quantity of Sulphur, &s;o as to make perfect Coal, are mo&s;t curiou&s;ly mark'd with Im|pre&s;&s;ions of Plants, particularly tho&s;e of Fern. This is indeed a Rock, full of Springs, a very bad Road for Travelling, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;hort and &s;teep Valleys, narrow Lanes, intricate, dark, and hard. The Ground is very rich, and bears much Wood. The Neatne&s;s of the Hou&s;es even of the poorer Sort of People is remarkable, being generally whited over, and imbel|li&s;h'd with little Gardens. We come in Ten Miles from <HI>Bath</HI> to the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the greate&s;t, the riche&s;t, and the be&s;t Port of Trade in <HI>Great-Britain, London</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P><HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> has been formerly a Place of Strength, and had a Ca&s;tle, in which King <HI>Stephen</HI> was kept Pri|&s;oner &s;ome time by <HI>Maud</HI> the Empre&s;s.

who demoli&s;h'd it. It is a County-Town, and one of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.'s new Bi&s;hopricks.</P>
<P>The Merchants of this City have not only the greate&s;t Trade, but they trade with a more intire In|dependency upon <HI>London,</HI> than any other Town in <HI>Britain.</HI> And 'tis evident in this Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> That what&s;oever Exportations they make to any Part of the World, they are able to bring the full Returns back to their own Port, and can di&s;po&s;e of them there; which is not the Ca&s;e in any other Port in <HI>England</HI>; where they are often oblig'd either to &s;hip part of the Effects in the Ports abroad, on the Ships bound to <HI>London</HI>; or to con&s;ign their own Ve&s;&s;els to <HI>London,</HI> in order both to get Freight, and di&s;po&s;e of their own Cargoes.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Merchants, as they have a very great Trade abroad, &s;o they have always Buyers at home for their Returns, and that &s;uch Buyers, that no Cargo is too big for them. To this Purpo&s;e, the Shopkeepers in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> who in general are Whole|&s;ale-men, have &s;o great an Inland Trade among all the We&s;tern Counties, that they maintain Carriers, ju&s;t as the <HI>London</HI> Trade&s;men do, to all the princi|pal Countries and Towns from <HI>Southampton</HI> in the South, even to the Banks of the <HI>Trent,</HI> North; al|though they have no navigable River that Way.</P>
<P>Add to this, That, as well by Sea, as by the Na|vigation of two great Rivers, the <HI>Wye,</HI> and the <HI>Se|vern,</HI> they have the whole Trade of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> as it were, to them&s;elves, and the greate&s;t Part of that of <HI>North-Wales</HI>; and as to their Trade to <HI>Ire|land,</HI> it is prodigiou&s;ly increas'd &s;ince the Revolu|tion, notwith&s;tanding the great Trade which of late the Merchants of <HI>Liverpool</HI> al&s;o drive with that Kingdom.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Inconveniencies of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> are its Si|tuation, its narrow Streets, and the Narrowne&s;s of its River; and we might mention al&s;o another

<HI>Narrow</HI>; that is, the <HI>Minds</HI> of the Generality of its People; for, let me tell you, the Merchants of <HI>Bri|&s;tol,</HI> tho' very rich, are not like the Merchants of <HI>London:</HI> the latter may be &s;aid (as of old of the Merchants of <HI>Tyre</HI>) to vie with the Princes of the Earth; whereas the former, being rais'd by good For|tune, and Prizes taken in the Wars, from Ma&s;ters of Ships, and blunt Tars, have imbib'd the Manners of the&s;e rough Gentlemen &s;o &s;trongly, that they tran&s;|mit it to their De&s;cendants, only with a little more of the Sordid, than is generally to be found among the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sailors; and I would advi&s;e the rich ones among them, if they would be a little more polite and generous, than they u&s;ually are, to <HI>travel,</HI> but not out of <HI>England</HI> neither; I mean only to <HI>Lon|don</HI> (that is, from the &s;econd great Trading Town to the fir&s;t); and they will &s;ee Examples worth their Imitation, as well for princely Spirit, as upright and generous Dealings.</P>
<P>The Corporation being very tenacious in not admit|ting Per&s;ons to trade in their Liberty, who are not Freemen, there are not &s;o many new Buildings, and Improvements of Streets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> as would otherwi&s;e be. As for the City it&s;elf, there is hardly Room to &s;et another Hou&s;e in it. The great Square, called <HI>Queen</HI>'s, formerly the <HI>Mead,</HI> where the Ground was &s;ubject to the Hazard of Inundations, is now &s;o rais'd, that it is free from that Inconvenience: It is very hand&s;omely built and inhabited, and a fine Eque|&s;trian Statue of King <HI>William</HI> III. erected in the middle of it, done by the famous <HI>Ry&s;brack.</HI></P>
<P>The Quay along the River is very noble, and well filled with all Sorts of Merchandize, and a hand&s;ome Row of Hou&s;es fronts it. And I was inform'd, when I was there la&s;t, that in order to make the Back of this City more commodious than ever, the Cor|poration have purcha&s;ed &s;everal Hou&s;es adjoining to the Back-Gate, in order to pull them down, and
<PB N="271" REF="280">
make all flu&s;h from the Conduit on the Back, clear round to the Quay; which when fini&s;h'd, will be one of the complete&s;t Harbours in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Quay is reckoned the longe&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> It has a Crane on it, the Workman&s;hip of the late ingenious Mr. <HI>Padmore,</HI> which is not to be equalled in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Merchants are greatly benefited by it, in the extraordinary Di&s;patch it gives to the di&s;charging of their Ships.</P>
<P><HI>College-Green</HI> is deemed the healthie&s;t Situation in the City.</P>
<P>There is erected within the&s;e few Years an A&s;&s;em|bly Room, for Entertainment and Amu&s;ement of the Gay, as at other con&s;iderable Places; for Luxury mu&s;t always follow Riches. It is a very hand&s;ome Building, and &s;tands in the Way from the City to the <HI>Hot-well.</HI></P>
<P>The old Theatre at <HI>Stokes-Croft</HI> is al&s;o alter'd into a commodious Room for an A&s;&s;embly, which is held every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> during the Winter.</P>
<P>There were, when I was there, no le&s;s than fif|teen Gla&s;s-Hou&s;es in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which is more than are in the City of <HI>London:</HI> they u&s;e indeed, them|&s;elves, a very great Number of Gla&s;s Bottles, which they &s;end fill'd with Beer, Cyder, and Wine, to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> much more than goes from <HI>London</HI>; al&s;o va&s;t Numbers of Bottles are now u&s;ed for &s;end|ing the Water of St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock, not only all over <HI>England,</HI> but, we may &s;ay, all over the World.</P>
<P>This <HI>Hot-well,</HI> or Water of St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock, is without the City, at the Confluence of the two little Rivers, and on the North-&s;ide of the Stream. Not many Years &s;ince, this Spring lay open at the Foot of the Rock, and was covered by the &s;alt Water at every Tide; and yet it pre&s;erved both its Warmth and Virtue intire.</P>
<P>The Rock, tho' hard to Admiration, has &s;ince that been work'd down, partly by Labour, and partly
<PB N="272" REF="281">
blown in Pieces by Gunpowder; and an hand&s;ome large Hou&s;e is built upon it, where they have good Apartments for entertaining di&s;temper'd Per&s;ons. The Well is &s;ecur'd, and a good Pump is fix'd in it, &s;o that they have the Water pure and unmix'd from the Spring it&s;elf, and they export va&s;t Quantities; for this Water keeps its Virtue better than that of <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>The following curious Account of the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Wa|ters, I am indebted for to the &s;ame eminent Phy&s;i|cian, who favoured me with the learned Account of the Nature, and Efficacy of the <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Tun|bridge</HI> Waters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Waters, he &s;ays, &s;eem only a natural Lime-water, or pure Element impregnated with a natural unburnt Lime&s;tone. All the Hills and Moun|tains round that Water are nothing but a Quarry of natural unburnt Lime&s;tone, which is daily dug up there for Building, and manife&s;ts it&s;elf to the Sen&s;es. This makes the&s;e <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Waters, one of the pure&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;alutary, mere aqueous Elements on the Globe, to cool all over-heated Bowels, and to le&s;&s;en all preternatural Di&s;charges. But the &s;mall <HI>Milk-warmth</HI> in them, when immediately pump'd up, upon the Well's being drain'd of the Influx of the Tide, &s;hews there is &s;ome other Principle in them be&s;ides natural Lime&s;tone: and that in Nature can be no other than &s;ome weak Impregnation of Sulphur with Nitre or Sea Salt, or perhaps a &s;light Touch of Iron. The Stones are &s;ome reddi&s;h, &s;ome blacki&s;h, that are digg'd out of the Mountains circumjacent, but all of them natural Lime&s;tone. The&s;e reddi&s;h and blacki&s;h Colours in the Stones nece&s;&s;arily imply Sulphur and Iron; and the&s;e Three Principles, by chymical Proce&s;&s;es and Mixtures, are di&s;covered in &s;ome &s;mall Proportion in the Waters. They are excellent in all &s;corbutick and nervous Atrophies, in Hecticks, weak Lungs, all Inflammations in what|ever
<PB N="273" REF="282">
Part, all preternatural Evacuations; in &s;hort, in all acrid Juices and vi&s;cid Blood, being a natural Simple <HI>Alcali</HI>; and in the fir&s;t Stages of a <HI>Phthi&s;is Pulmonum</HI>; and if early had recour&s;e to, and long continued under a low, cooling, nutritive Regimen, they would probably &s;top the Growth and Cau&s;es of mo&s;t chronical Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>There are 17 Pari&s;hes in the City, but 19 Churches, including the Cathedral and the Church of <HI>St. Mark.</HI> There are be&s;ides tho&s;e Churches, &s;everal Meeting-hou&s;es, for the different Sectaries, <HI>viz.</HI> Independents, Quakers, and Bapti&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is far from extraordinary.</P>
<P>Several of the Churches are very neat, and beau|tifully decorated, and worthy a Traveller's Attention. That of <HI>St. Mary Radcliffe,</HI> or <HI>Redcliff,</HI> is a noble and &s;tately Edifice. It is very large and &s;pacious, and has a fine Steeple or Tower.</P>
<P>In it is a very antient Monument for Mr. <HI>William Cannings,</HI> Burge&s;s and Merchant of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the Foun|der of the Church, and a great Benefactor otherwi&s;e to the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>On one Part of the Monument is a <HI>Latin</HI> In&s;crip|tion, full of Abbreviations; and, on the other Side, in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> an In&s;cription to his Prai&s;e, which I have not room to in&s;ert.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o an In&s;cription on the Monument of Sir <HI>William Penn,</HI> Knt. Vice-Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> the Fa|ther of the great <HI>William Penn,</HI> one of the Heads of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who was a Native of the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>A great Face of Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Religion appears at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and the Magi&s;trates are laudably &s;trict in exacting the Ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath, con&s;ider|ing the general Di&s;&s;olutene&s;s that has broken in almo&s;t every-where el&s;e.</P>
<P>One thing they de&s;erve high Commendation for; and that is the Neatne&s;s ob&s;erv'd in keeping their Churches, and the Care they take in pre&s;erving the
<PB N="274" REF="283">
Monuments and In&s;criptions of tho&s;e bury'd in 'em. A Practice &s;candalou&s;ly neglected almo&s;t every-where el&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> and even at Places we might men|tion, where Money (another &s;candalous Practice) is exacted for &s;eeing them. This Care of the Monu|ments of the Dead brings many Vi&s;itors to their Churches of travelling Strangers, who are always pleas'd with it, and make Compari&s;ons in its Favour, tho' very little to the Credit of &s;ome others, who are more negligent. 'Tis indeed &s;trange, That the Heirs and Families of the Decea&s;ed &s;hould not think them|&s;elves more concern'd, than they generally are, to keep up the Monuments of their Ance&s;tors. With great Piety, and at a great Expence, the next Heir, or the mo&s;t oblig'd, rears a Monument to the Deceas'd, and it is dedicated, too, profe&s;&s;edly, to Po&s;terity. In a very little while, the Monument is cover'd with Du&s;t and Cobwebs, and the In&s;cription often effaced. Com|mon Decency does not &s;ucceed to this Piety, and it becomes a Monument of the Ingratitude or Neglect of the Survivors, rather than an Honour to the De|ceas'd.</P>
<P>Methinks Vanity alone, the common Inducement to the&s;e Erections, &s;hould in&s;pire another Manner of Acting. I cannot account for it any other way, but that from the Prince to the Pea&s;ant, as a Family generally lies together in one Vault or Tomb, very few are willing to &s;ee or think of their Coffins; and hence it is, That &s;ome Men often look upon their very Heirs as <HI>Memento Mori's.</HI> Unhappy Narrow|ne&s;s of Mind, equally to be lamented and de&s;pis'd!</P>
<P><HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have an hundred thou&s;and Inhabitants in the City, and within three Miles of its Circumference; and they &s;ay, above Three Thou|&s;and Sail of Ships belong to that Port.</P>
<P>'Tis very remarkable, That this City is &s;o well &s;upply'd with Coals, that tho' they are all brought by Land Carriage, yet they are generally laid down
<PB N="275" REF="284">
at the Doors of the Inhabitants, at &s;even, eight, or nine Shillings <HI>per</HI> Chaldron.</P>
<P>The Situation of the City is low, but on the Side of a ri&s;ing Hill. The Ground Plat of it is &s;aid very much to re&s;emble that of old <HI>Rome,</HI> being circular, with a &s;omething greater Diameter one way than an|other, but enough to make it oval; and the River cutting off one &s;mall Part, as it were, a Sixth, or le&s;s, from the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Bridge over the <HI>Avon</HI> is exceeding &s;trong, the Arches very high, becau&s;e of the Depth of Wa|ter, and the Buildings &s;o clo&s;e upon it, that in pa&s;|&s;ing the Bridge, you &s;ee nothing but an intire full-built Street. The Tide of Flood ri&s;es here near &s;ix Fathom, and runs very &s;trong.</P>
<P>They draw all their heavy Goods here on <HI>Sleds,</HI> or <HI>Sledges,</HI> which they call <HI>Gee-hoes,</HI> without Wheels. This kills a Multitude of Hor&s;es; and the Pavement is worn &s;o &s;mooth by them, that in wet Weather the Streets are very &s;lippery, and in fro&s;ty Weather 'tis dangerous walking.</P>
<P>The noble Charities of Mr. <HI>Edward Col&s;ton,</HI> a worthy Merchant of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and his Foundations, are an Honour to the Place, and to the Memory of that excellent Man: and I am &s;orry, that my narrow Limits will not permit me to give a particular Account of them.</P>
<P>But I ought not to omit, that one of his Cha|rities only, co&s;t him 25000<HI>l.</HI> and that is the noble Ho&s;pital or Alms-hou&s;e erected by him, in the Year 1691, upon his own Ground, on <HI>St. Mi|chael's-Hill.</HI> The Front and two Sides are fac'd with Free&s;tone: it contains a Chapel neatly adorn'd, 24 Apartments, and other Conveniencies, for 12 Men, and 12 Women. The elder Brother receives 6<HI>s.</HI> and each of the others 3<HI>s.</HI> weekly, be&s;ides an Allowance for Coal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To a Clergyman is paid the Sum of 10<HI>l.</HI> yearly, for reading the <HI>Common</HI>
<PB N="276" REF="285">
<HI>Prayer</HI> twice every Day, except when Prayers are read in <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s Church, at which every Mem|ber of this Alms-hou&s;e is to attend.</P>
<P>In the Year 1696, he al&s;o purchas'd a Piece of Ground in <HI>Temple-&s;treet,</HI> and built at his own Charge a School and Dwelling-hou&s;e, for a Ma&s;ter to in&s;truct 40 Boys, in Writing, Arithmetick, and the Church Catechi&s;m. The Boys are likewi&s;e to be cloathed.</P>
<P>And his other Charities and Benefactions were without Number.</P>
<P>On <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s Day, <HI>June</HI> 29. 1738, was open'd at the Mint, an Infirmary for this City, for the Re|ception of the &s;ick, lame, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Poor, after the Example of tho&s;e in <HI>London, Winche&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c. It is denominated <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s Ho&s;pital, and very liberal Contributions have been made to it; and par|ticularly, we are told, that <HI>John Elbridge,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Comptroller of the Cu&s;toms in this City, who dy'd <HI>February</HI> 1738-9, be&s;ides many other charitable Do|nations, bequeathed 5000<HI>l.</HI> to this Infirmary, be&s;ides endowing a Charity School on <HI>St. Michael</HI>'s Hill, which he built &s;everal Years before his Death, for edu|cating and cloathing a certain Number of poor Girls.</P>
<P>Large Pieces of Ground are clear'd for building a Market, and a magnificent Exchange; the former in <HI>High-&s;treet,</HI> and the latter in <HI>Corn-&s;treet.</HI> The old Buildings which have been de&s;troy'd for that Pur|po&s;e, have co&s;t the Chamber of this City upwards of Twenty thou&s;and Pounds. And on the 10th of <HI>March</HI> 1740-1, the fir&s;t Stone of the Exchange was laid by the Mayor, with great Ceremony, with &s;everal Pieces of Gold and Silver Coin under it, and this In&s;cription, on the Stone:
<Q><HI>Regnante GEORGIO</HI> II. <HI>Pio, Felici, Augu&s;to, Libertatis &amp; Rei Mercatoriae Domi Fori&s;que Vindice, primarium Lapidem huju&s;ce Aedificii, Suffragio Civium, &amp; Aere publico extructi, po&s;uit</HI> HENRICUS COMBE, <HI>Praetor, A.

<Q><HI>In the Reign of</HI> GEORGE II. <HI>Pious, Pro&s;perous, Augu&s;t, Vindicator, at Home and Abroad, of Li|berty and Trade,</HI> HENRY COMBE, <HI>Mayor, placed the Fir&s;t Stone of this Structure erected by the Votes of the Citizens, and at the publick Ex|pence,</HI> A. D. 1740.</Q></P>
<P>This Edifice when fini&s;h'd, will be one of the com|plete&s;t of its Kind in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The old Library in <HI>King-&s;treet</HI> is rebuilding in a very hand&s;ome Manner, as is al&s;o <HI>Merchant-Taylors-Hall</HI> in <HI>Broad-&s;treet,</HI> a Free&s;tone Building near 70 Feet long, and Breadth proportionable.</P>
<P>From this City I had Thoughts of coa&s;ting the Mar&s;hes or Border of <HI>Wales,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>South-Wales,</HI> by tracing the Rivers <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Lug,</HI> in <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Hereford&s;hire:</HI> but chang'd my Mind on Occa|&s;ion of the Danger of the Ferries over the <HI>Severn.</HI> In the mean time, I re&s;olv'd to follow the Cour&s;e of this famous River, by which I &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily &s;ee the riche&s;t, mo&s;t fertile, and mo&s;t agreeable Part of <HI>England</HI>; the Banks of the <HI>Thames</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> We&s;t, you enter the County of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and keeping the <HI>Avon</HI> in View, you &s;ee <HI>King-Road,</HI> where the Ships generally take their De|parture, as ours at <HI>London</HI> do from <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and <HI>Hung-Road</HI>; and where they notify their Arrival, as ours for <HI>London</HI> do in the <HI>Downs.</HI> The one lies within the <HI>Avon,</HI> the other in the <HI>Severn Sea.</HI> In|deed great Part of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> is in the Bounds of <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> though it be a County of it&s;elf. From hence going away a little North-we&s;t, we come to the <HI>Pill,</HI> a convenient Road for Shipping, and where therefore they generally run back for <HI>Ireland,</HI> or for <HI>Wales.</HI> There is al&s;o, a little farther, an ugly, dan|gerous, and very inconvenient Ferry over the <HI>Severn,</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Wye</HI>; namely, at <HI>Au&s;t</HI>; which I &s;hall mention again pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="287">As we turn <HI>North</HI> towards <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> we lo&s;e the Sight of the <HI>Avon,</HI> and, in about two Miles, exchange it for an open View of the <HI>Severn Sea,</HI> which you &s;ee on the We&s;t Side, and which &s;eems as broad as the Ocean there; except that you &s;ee two &s;mall I&s;lands in it, and that looking N. W. you di&s;cern plainly the Coa&s;t of <HI>South-Wales</HI>; and particularly, a little nearer hand, the Shore of <HI>Monmouth&s;hire.</HI> Then, as you go on, the Shores begin to draw towards one another, and the Coa&s;ts to lie parallel; &s;o that the <HI>Severn</HI> appears to be a plain River, or an <HI>Ae&s;tu|arium,</HI> &s;omewhat like the <HI>Humber,</HI> or as the <HI>Thames</HI> is at the <HI>Nore,</HI> being 4 to 5 and 6 Miles over; and is indeed a mo&s;t raging and furious kind of Sea. This is occa&s;ion'd by tho&s;e violent Tides call'd the <HI>Bore,</HI> which flow here &s;ometimes 6 or 7 Feet at once, rol|ling forward like a mighty Wave: &s;o that the Stern of a Ve&s;&s;el &s;hall on a &s;udden be lifted up 6 or 7 Feet upon the Water, when the Head of it is fa&s;t a-ground.</P>
<P>After Coa&s;ting the Shore about 4 Miles farther, the Road being by the low Salt Mar&s;hes kept at a Di&s;tance from the River; we came to <HI>Au&s;t</HI> Ferry, from a little dirty Village call'd <HI>Au&s;t</HI>; near which you come to take Boat.</P>
<P>This Ferry lands you at <HI>Beachly</HI> in <HI>Monmouth|&s;hire,</HI> &s;o that on the Out&s;ide it is call'd <HI>Au&s;t Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> and on the other Side <HI>Beachly Pa&s;&s;age.</HI> From whence you go by Land two little Miles to <HI>Chep|&s;tow,</HI> a large Port Town on the River <HI>Wye.</HI> But of that Part I &s;hall &s;ay more in its Place.</P>
<P>Here is a good neat Chapel, with an high Tower at the We&s;t-end, adorned with Pinacles.</P>
<P>This Place is memorable from a Circum&s;tance in the Reign of King <HI>Edw.</HI> I. who being here, invited <HI>Lewellin</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who was on the other Side, to come over and confer with him, and &s;ettle &s;ome Matters in Di&s;pute between them; but the
<PB N="279" REF="288">
Prince refu&s;ed, and the King thereupon cro&s;s'd over to him, who, in a Rapture of Genero&s;ity, leap'd into the Water, to receive the King in his Boat, telling him, His Humility had conquer'd his Pride, and his Wi&s;dom triumphed over his Folly.</P>
<P>When we came to <HI>Au&s;t,</HI> the hither Side of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> the Sea was &s;o broad, the Fame of the <HI>Bore</HI> of the Tide &s;o formidable, the Wind al&s;o made the Water &s;o rough, and, which was wor&s;e, the Boats to carry over both Man and Hor&s;e appear'd &s;o very mean, that, in &s;hort, none of us car'd to venture: &s;o we came back, and re&s;olv'd to keep on the Road to <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thornbury</HI> is a Market Town, and hath a Cu&s;to|mary Mayor and 12 Aldermen, and was given in the Conqueror's Time to the famous <HI>Fitz-Hammon.</HI> Here are the Foundations of a large Ca&s;tle, de&s;ign'd but never fini&s;h'd, by the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.'s Time. Here is a &s;pacious Church built Cathedral-wi&s;e, it has fine wide Ayles, and 3 Chancels, with a high and beautiful Tower. Here is a Free-School and 4 &s;mall Alms-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>On the right lies <HI>Wotton,</HI> a pretty Market-town, governed by a Mayor elected annually at the Court-Leet. 'Tis famous for its Cloathing Trade. The Church, which is a Vicarage, is large, and hath Two wide Ayles, and an high hand&s;ome Tower, adorned with Battlements and Pinacles. There are in it di|vers Tombs, Monuments, and In&s;criptions, chiefly for the Family of <HI>Berkley.</HI> Here is a Free-&s;chool and &s;ome Charity-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Directly North of this Town lies <HI>Dur&s;ley,</HI> a good Cloathing and Market Town, governed by a Bailiff and 4 Con&s;tables, and has been formerly noted for &s;harp, over-reaching People, from whence aro&s;e a Proverbial Saying of a &s;harp Man, <HI>He is a Man of</HI> Dur&s;ley. The Church is good, hath 2 Ayles, and an hand&s;ome Spire.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="289">Turning North-we&s;t, we came to <HI>Berkley,</HI> a noted Town, &s;o called from <HI>Berk,</HI> a Beech, and <HI>Leas,</HI> Pa&s;|ture. It is the large&s;t Pari&s;h in the County, and con&s;i&s;ts of rich Meadow-grounds, and above 30 Pari&s;hes depend on this Manor, for which a Fee|farm Rent was paid, in King <HI>Henry</HI> II.'s Time, of 500<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> which &s;hews the va&s;t Extent and Value of this E&s;tate. It belongs to the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Berkley,</HI> who is al&s;o Baron of <HI>Dur&s;ley.</HI> Adjoin|ing to this Town is the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Berkley,</HI> a magnificent, tho' antique Building, and the antient Seat of this noble Family, from whence it derives its Name as well as Title, ever &s;ince the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> II. who gave it to <HI>Robert Fitzharding,</HI> who a&s;&s;umed the Name of <HI>Berkley,</HI> and from whom the pre&s;ent Earl is lineally de&s;cended. King <HI>Edw.</HI> II. of <HI>England,</HI> as all our learned Writers agree, was murder'd in this Ca&s;tle; as King <HI>Richard</HI> II. was in that of <HI>Pontefract,</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire</HI>; but I refer to our Hi&s;tories for the&s;e horrid Facts. They &s;hew the Apartments, where they &s;ay that King was kept a Pri&s;oner: but they do not admit that he was kill'd there. The Place is rather antient, than plea&s;ant or healthful, lying low, and near the Water. Here is a large &s;pacious Church, with an Ayle on each Side, and a Chapel adjoining, which is the Burial-place of the Family, a neat Ve&s;try, and a &s;trong high Tower.</P>
<P>On the Right of the Road is <HI>Stanley,</HI> a little Mar|ket-town, where was formerly a Priory, the Ruins whereof appear &s;till. The Church is built in the Form of a Cro&s;s, with a Tower in the middle.</P>
<P>A great Improvement has been lately made in the&s;e Parts; for the Earl of <HI>Berkley</HI> has ju&s;t fini&s;hed (1740) a great Bulwark at <HI>Frampton</HI> upon <HI>Severn,</HI> near this Place, called <HI>Hock-Crib,</HI> the De&s;ign of which is to inforce the River <HI>Severn,</HI> by <HI>Art's-Point,</HI> into its former Chanel. It is &s;aid his Lord&s;hip intends to
<PB N="281" REF="290">
build another, four Miles below the former, by which he will undoubtedly gain a large Tract of Land, contiguous to what is call'd the <HI>New Grounds,</HI> infe|rior to none in <HI>England</HI> for the Richne&s;s of its Soil.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;aw, acro&s;s the River, the antient Fore&s;t of <HI>Dean,</HI> which once contained 30000 Acres of Land, being Twenty Miles long, and &s;o full of Wood, that it was very dangerous to travel through it. Its Oak was famous for Shipping, the Glory of our own, and &s;o much the Envy of other Nations, that the famous <HI>Spani&s;h Armada</HI> had it in &s;pecial Charge to burn it. The great Number of Iron Forges near it has greatly le&s;&s;ened, tho' not con|&s;um'd the Wood, which is &s;till pre&s;erved with great Care. It is &s;ubject to Fore&s;t-Laws, and the Iron-Miners have here a Court al&s;o.</P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> we &s;ee nothing con&s;i|derable, but a mo&s;t fertile, rich Country, and a fine River, but narrower, as you go Northward, till, a little before we come to <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> it cea&s;es to be navigable by Ships of Burden, but continues to be &s;o, by large Barges, above an hundred Miles farther, not reckoning the Turnings and Windings of the River: be&s;ides that it receives &s;everal large and na|vigable Rivers into it.</P>
<P><HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> (call'd by the <HI>Britons, Caer-glow,</HI> i. e. <HI>Fine City,</HI> and in Imitation of it <HI>Glevum</HI> by the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>) abounds much with Cro&s;&s;es and Statues of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and has an hand&s;ome Pro&s;pect of Steeples, &s;ome without a Church; for in the late Civil Wars, when it held out vigorou&s;ly again&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and was then very &s;trong, it &s;uffer'd much; for its Eleven Churches were then reduced to Five, and all its Walls and Works were demoli&s;hed. The City is &s;till tolerably built; and here is a large Stone Bridge over the <HI>Severn,</HI> the fir&s;t next the Sea. Here are &s;everal Market-hou&s;es &s;upported with Pillars, one a very old one of Stone, in <HI>Gothick</HI> Architecture,
<PB N="282" REF="291">
antient and uncommon, now turn'd into a Ci&s;tern for Water.</P>
<P>The old Proverb, <HI>As &s;ure as God's at</HI> Glouce&s;ter, certainly alluded to the va&s;t Number of Churches and religious Foundations here; for you can &s;carce walk pa&s;t 10 Doors, but &s;omewhat of that &s;ort occurs.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is an old venerable Pile. The We&s;tern Part is old and mean; but from the Tower, which is very hand&s;ome, you have a mo&s;t glorious Pro&s;pect Ea&s;tward, thro' the Choir finely vaulted at top; and the Ladies Chapel to the Ea&s;t Window, which is very magnificent. On the North-&s;ide lies that unfortunate King <HI>Edw.</HI> II. in an Alaba&s;ter Tomb, and, out of the Abundance of pious Offerings to his Remains, the Religious built this Choir; and the Votaries to his Shrine, for &s;ome time after his Death, could hardly find Room in the Town. So changeable are the Tempers of Men! and &s;o little a Space is requir'd to di&s;po&s;e the Minds of the fluctu|ating Many, to <HI>Ho&s;annah</HI> or <HI>Crucify!</HI></P>
<P>Before the High Altar in the Middle of the Church, lies the equally unfortunate Prince <HI>Robert,</HI> elde&s;t Son of the Conqueror, after a mi&s;erable Life for many Years before his Death. But his Monument re|mains, and his Bones are at Re&s;t; which is more than can be &s;aid of the Monument of his younger Brother, King <HI>Henry</HI> I. who, as the &s;econd Brother <HI>William Rufus</HI> had done, robbed him of his Right, and no Traces of his Monument are left at <HI>Reading-Abbey,</HI> where he was bury'd with his Queen. He lies in a wooden Tomb, with his Coat of Arms painted, and upon it his Effigies in <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Oak, cro&s;s|legg'd like a <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Knight. The famous <HI>Strong|bow,</HI> who &s;ubdued <HI>Ireland,</HI> lies buried in the Chapter-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Cloy&s;ters in this Cathedral are exqui&s;itely beautiful, in the Style of the Chapel of <HI>King's-College, Cambridge.</HI> There are large Remains in the City
<PB N="283" REF="292">
of Abbeys of Black and White Friers. A Mile or two di&s;tant is <HI>Robin Hood</HI>'s Hill, as it is called, which affords now a plea&s;ant Walk for the Citizens, and from which they are attempting to &s;upply the City with Water, which it much wants. By this City, the <HI>Rickning</HI> Way runs from the <HI>Severn</HI>'s Mouth into <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants boa&s;t much of the Antiquity of their fir&s;t Cathedral, which they pretend had Bi&s;hops and Preachers here <HI>Anno</HI> 189: The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Cathedral, we &s;ay; for, it has been, as reported, thrice de&s;troy'd by Fire.</P>
<P><HI>William the Conqueror</HI> gave this City and Ca&s;tle to the famous <HI>Robert Fitz-Hammon,</HI> afterwards Lord of <HI>Glamorgan. Edol,</HI> one of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nobles, who at|tended King <HI>Vortigern</HI> to the Congre&s;s appointed by <HI>Hengi&s;t,</HI> was Earl of this Place. He was a Man of great per&s;onal Strength, and &s;eeing the <HI>Saxons</HI> draw|ing forth their conceal'd Weapons, he di&s;arm'd one of them, and fought valiantly; but being overpower'd by Numbers, he e&s;cap'd to this City, after having kill'd 70 <HI>Saxons</HI> with his own Hands. Afterwards, in a Battle fought again&s;t the <HI>Saxons</HI> near the River <HI>Don,</HI> he fix'd his Eye upon <HI>Hengi&s;t,</HI> and never quitted him, till he took him Pri&s;oner, and &s;truck off his Head.</P>
<P>In the little I&s;le of <HI>Alney,</HI> near this Town, the famous &s;ingle Combat was fought between <HI>Edmund Iron&s;ide</HI> and <HI>Canute</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> for the whole King|dom, in Sight of both their Armies.</P>
<P>The City is governed by a Mayor, 12 Aldermen, and 24 Common-council-men. It has al&s;o an High-Steward, (who is u&s;ually a Nobleman) and a Re|corder. They are allow'd the highe&s;t Marks of magi&s;tratical Honour, Scarlet Gowns, the Sword, and Cap of Maintenance, and 4 Sergeants at Mace. Here are 12 Companies, the Ma&s;ters whereof attend the Mayor on all publick Occa&s;ions in their Gowns,
<PB N="284" REF="293">
and with Streamers. It has a large Quay and Wharf on the River for Trade, and a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. Here is al&s;o a Town-hall for the A&s;&s;izes and publick Bu|&s;ine&s;s, which they call the <HI>Booth-hall,</HI> and great Part of the Ca&s;tle is &s;till &s;tanding.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hop of this Church was that truly Reverend and Religious Divine, Dr. <HI>John Hooper,</HI> who was burnt to Death in the Cemetery of his own Cathedral, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>The Whi&s;pering-place in this Cathedral formerly pa&s;s'd for a kind of Wonder among the Vulgar; but &s;ince, Experience has taught the ea&s;ily-compre|hended Rea&s;on of the Thing; and there is now the like in the Church of <HI>St. Paul, London.</HI></P>
<P>Here is great Provi&s;ion for the Poor by Ho&s;pitals; particularly <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s Ho&s;pital maintains 54 Men and Women, to whom belong a Mini&s;ter, Phy|&s;ician and Surgeon. And Sir <HI>Thomas Rich,</HI> Bart. a Native of this Place, gave 6000<HI>l.</HI> by Will, for a <HI>Blue-Coat</HI> Ho&s;pital, wherein are educated 20 poor Boys; and 10 poor Men and 10 Women are main|tain'd, and cloath'd annually. Be&s;ides the&s;e and three more, there are many Benefactions to encou|rage young Trade&s;men, and place out Boys Appren|tices. And they have lately erected an Infirmary here, after the laudable Example of that of <HI>Win|che&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>At <HI>La&s;&s;ington,</HI> near <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> are found certain Stones about the Breadth of a Silver Peny, and Thick|ne&s;s of a Half-crown, called <HI>A&s;troites</HI> or Star-&s;tones, being fine-pointed like a Star, and flat. They are of a greyi&s;h Colour, and the flat Sides are naturally finely engraven, as it were. But I have taken No|tice of the&s;e before.</P>
<P>From <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> we kept Ea&s;tward, and &s;oon came to <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> a Market-town, where is &s;till a pretty good Trade carried on in Malt, but not &s;o con&s;iderable as formerly. Here is a good Church in
<PB N="285" REF="294">
the Form of a Cro&s;s, with Ayles on each Side, and a Spire ri&s;ing in the Middle, noted for a good Ring of Bells. But what is more remarkable is, that the Mini&s;ter is to be nominated by, and mu&s;t be a Fellow of, <HI>Je&s;us-College, Oxon,</HI> (tho' the Vicarage is but 40<HI>l.</HI> a Year) but approv'd of by the Earl of <HI>Gain&s;|borough</HI>; and he can't hold it more than &s;ix Years. Here is a Free-&s;chool, an Ho&s;pital, and &s;ome other Charities.</P>
<P>The Mineral Waters lately di&s;covered at <HI>Chelten|ham,</HI> which are of the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Kind, are what will make this Place &s;till more and more remarkable, and frequented. An eminent Phy&s;ician has obliged me with the following Account of their Nature, and Qualities.</P>
<P>The&s;e Waters, he ob&s;erves, were fir&s;t found out by the Flocks of all the neighbouring Pigeons going con&s;tantly thither to provoke their Appetites, as well as to quench the uncommon Thir&s;t of the&s;e &s;alacious hot Birds. I have been informed, &s;ays he, by a Phy|&s;ician of Credit and Experience, who had made all the common Trials on them, and ob&s;erved their Effects on many Per&s;ons of various Con&s;titutions, and in different Di&s;tempers, who had drank them, That, on Evaporation, they were found to contain, in a Gallon, eight Drachms of a nitrous Salt, with two Drachms of an alcalious Earth: That they were compounded of a large Quantity of Nitre, to which they owed their purgative Virtue; a light Sulphur, which the fetid Dejections manife&s;ted; and a vola|tile Steel, di&s;coverable by a tran&s;parent blue Colour, when mix'd with an Infu&s;ion of Nut-galls. Alca|lious Spirits have no Effect on them; but they fer|ment with Acids. He further adds, That there might be found &s;ome other Materials in their Com|po&s;ition, perhaps, if more minutely examined and tortured: but that the&s;e mentioned Principles were evident and inconte&s;table, and were &s;ufficient to ac|count
<PB N="286" REF="295">
for all their Effects and Operation; the others (if there be any) being of little Efficacy. In the Operation they empty the Bowels according to their Do&s;e, but gently, mildly, and ea&s;ily, without Sick|ne&s;s, Nau&s;ea, Gripes, or cau&s;ing great Lowne&s;s, far beyond any artificial Purges what&s;oever. They give a good Appetite, an ea&s;y Dige&s;tion, and quiet Nights, in all Nephritick and Gouty Ca&s;es, when not under the Fit; in all Rheumatick, Scrophulous, Scorbutic, or Leprous Ca&s;es; but e&s;pecially in Spermatic, Uri|nary, or Haemorrhoidal Ca&s;es, he thinks them &s;o|vereign, and not to be match'd. In a Word, in all Inflammatory Ca&s;es of whatever Kind, and what|ever Part, he thinks them one of the mo&s;t &s;alutary Means which can be u&s;ed. Tho&s;e of pretty &s;trong Nerves, and firm Con&s;titutions, bear them with high Spirits, great Plea&s;ure, and Profit; but they do not at all &s;uit with tho&s;e of weak Nerves, Paralytick, Hypo|chondriack, or Hy&s;terick Di&s;orders, or tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to any kind of Fits, Cramps, or Convul&s;ions: they ruffle &s;uch too much, as generally all Purga|tives do. He thinks they have a great Affinity to the <HI>Scarborough</HI> Waters, and might do great Cures in mo&s;t Chronical Di&s;tempers, if Exerci&s;e, and a proper Regimen, were directed with them.</P>
<P>Following the Road towards <HI>Warwick</HI> directly, we arriv'd at <HI>Winchcomb,</HI> a &s;mall Market-town, &s;ituate in a Bottom, in the mid&s;t of good Pa&s;ture and Arable Lands, but of no great Account. The Church is a good Building, hath two Ayles, a large Chancel, and a lofty Tower adorn'd with Battlements and Pina|cles. It is remarkable, that it is a Curacy worth no more than 10<HI>l.</HI> a Year, tho' the Impropriation is worth 300<HI>l.</HI> annually. Here was formerly a very rich Abbey, whereof the Abbot was Mitred, founded by <HI>Offa</HI> King of <HI>Mercia.</HI></P>
<P>Here we turned from the Road, and &s;truck N.W. to <HI>Tewk&s;bury,</HI> encompa&s;&s;ed with 4 Rivers; the <HI>Avon</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="296">
and <HI>Carran</HI> on the N. the <HI>Severn</HI> on the W. and the <HI>Swyliate</HI> on the S. 'Tis govern'd by 2 Bailiffs, and 24 Burge&s;&s;es; and its Neighbourhood to <HI>Cot&s;wold-Downs</HI> makes the Cloathing Trade flouri&s;h here. It is a large and very populous Town, &s;ituate upon the <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> River <HI>Avon,</HI> &s;o call'd to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the <HI>Bri&s;tol Avon,</HI> and others. The Town was long famous for its Mu&s;tard-balls, as al&s;o for a great Manufacture of Stockens; as are al&s;o <HI>Camp|den</HI> in this County, and <HI>Per&s;hore</HI> in <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The great old Church at <HI>Tewk&s;bury</HI> may be called one of the large&s;t Churches in <HI>England,</HI> that is not Collegiate or Cathedral. It is very high, has two &s;pacious Ayles, a &s;tately Tower, and a large Chancel. The Communion-Table is one intire Marble Stone near 14 Feet long, and 3 and &frac12; broad.</P>
<P>The Town is famous for the deci&s;ive Battle fought between the Hou&s;es of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> IV. of the latter Hou&s;e, who was Conqueror.</P>
<P>As <HI>Tewk&s;bury</HI> lies on the Borders of <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> we &s;oon entered that County, and came to <HI>Upton,</HI> an antient Market-Town of &s;ome Note upon the <HI>Severn,</HI> over which it has a good Bridge. <HI>Roman</HI> Coins are frequently dug up here.</P>
<P>On the Left, We&s;tward of this Town, and which parts this County from that of <HI>Hereford,</HI> are <HI>Mal|vern</HI> Hills, which con&s;i&s;t of large Mountains, prodi|giou&s;ly high and lofty, gradually ri&s;ing one above another for about 7 Miles together. On the&s;e Hills are two Villages, call'd <HI>Great Malvern</HI> and <HI>Little Malvern,</HI> at the Di&s;tance of about Two Miles from each other, each having had formerly an Abbey of <HI>Benedictines,</HI> the la&s;t lying in a di&s;mal Cavity be|tween the Hills. On the very Top of the&s;e Hills may be &s;een the Ruins of a prodigious Ditch, which <HI>Gilbert</HI> Earl of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> dug, to &s;eparate his Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="288" REF="297">
from tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>Hereford.</HI> On the&s;e Hills are 2 Medicinal Springs, called <HI>Holy Wells:</HI> one is good for the Eyes, and putrid fetid Livers; and the other for Cancers.</P>
<P>From <HI>Upton</HI> we travelled North-ea&s;t, and came to <HI>Per&s;hore,</HI> which lies on the lower <HI>London</HI> Road to <HI>Worce&s;ter:</HI> it is &s;aid to be &s;o called from the great Number of Pear-trees, which thrive plentifully here. It is a plea&s;ant Market-Town lying on the <HI>Avon,</HI> and famous for the Stocken Trade, as I have men|tioned before.</P>
<P>Ea&s;tward of this Town &s;tands <HI>Eve&s;ham,</HI> &s;ituate on a gentle A&s;cent from the &s;ame River, over which it hath a Bridge of 7 &s;tately Arches. It is an antient Mayor-town, and has the Privilege to try Felons. It is memorable for the deci&s;ive Battle, wherein <HI>Simon Montfort</HI> and the Barons were defeated by Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> afterwards King <HI>Edward</HI> I. who thereby relea&s;ed his Father out of Captivity. Here are 2 Churches, with &s;mall Spire Steeples; but nei|ther of them has any Bells, which have been re|moved to a famous Tower built by Abbot <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and &s;tands near the&s;e Churches.</P>
<P>All around this Town lies that fruitful and plen|tiful Country, call'd from this Place, <HI>The Vale of Eve&s;ham,</HI> which runs all along the Banks of the <HI>Avon,</HI> from <HI>Tewk&s;bury</HI> to <HI>Per&s;hore,</HI> and to <HI>Stratford</HI> upon <HI>Avon,</HI> in the South Part of <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI>; which River is &s;o far navigable.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;h Church of <HI>Stratford</HI> is very old. In it we &s;aw the Monument of the inimitable <HI>Shake|&s;peare,</HI> who&s;e Dramatick Performances &s;et him at the Head of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Theatre, and will make him renown'd to the End of Time. His Bu&s;to is in the Wall on the North-&s;ide of the Church, and a flat Grave-&s;tone covers the Body, in the Ayle ju&s;t un|der him; on which Grave-&s;tone the&s;e Lines are written:
<Q><PB N="289" REF="298">
<L><HI>Good Friend, for Je&s;us' &s;ake, forbear</HI></L>
<L><HI>To move the Du&s;t that re&s;teth here.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ble&s;t be the Man that &s;pares the&s;e Stones;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And cur&s;t be he, that moves my Bones!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Over the <HI>Avon</HI> at <HI>Stratford</HI> is built a fair Stone Bridge of 14 Arches, with a long Cau&s;eway at the We&s;t End of it, wall'd on both Sides.</P>
<P>The Navigation of this River <HI>Avon</HI> is an exceeding Advantage to all this Part of the Country, and al&s;o to the Commerce of the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> For by this River they drive a very great Trade for Sugar, Oil, Wine, Tobacco, Iron, Lead, and, in a Word, all heavy, Goods which are u&s;ually carried by Water almo&s;t as far as <HI>Warwick</HI>; and in Return, the Corn, and e&s;pecially Chee&s;e, are carried back from <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; for <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter</HI> Chee&s;e is excellent of the kind, and this County drives a great Trade in it.</P>
<P>This Vale extending it&s;elf in <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> and under the Ridge of little Mountains call'd <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> is there call'd the Vale of <HI>Red-hor&s;e.</HI> All the Grounds, put together, make a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Corn Country, e&s;pecially remarkable for the Goodne&s;s of the Air, and Fertility of the Soil.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Stretford,</HI> on the Borders of this County of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> is <HI>Alce&s;ter,</HI> a Market-town, much frequented by Dealers in Corn: it is of great Antiquity; as appears by old Foundations of Build|ings made of <HI>Roman</HI> Brick, and Gold, Silver and Bra&s;s Coins found here. The old <HI>Roman</HI> Way, called <HI>Ikenild-&s;treet,</HI> pa&s;&s;es thro' the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over, without &s;ome Account of another plea&s;ant and fruitful Vale, which cro&s;&s;es part of the Country, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, on that Side of the <HI>Cot&s;wold,</HI> and which is called <HI>Stroud-water</HI>; famous not only for the fine&s;t Cloths, but for dying tho&s;e Cloths of the beautifule&s;t
<PB N="290" REF="299">
Scarlets, and other grand Colours, that are any|where in <HI>England,</HI> perhaps in any Part of the World. Here I &s;aw Two Pieces of Broad-cloth made, one Scarlet, the other Crim&s;on in Grain, which were &s;ent as Pre&s;ents, the one to the late King <HI>George,</HI> whil&s;t Elector, and the other to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, which were very graciou&s;ly accepted. The Cloth was valued at 45<HI>s. per</HI> Yard, and was well worth it; for nothing &s;o rich of that kind had been ever made in <HI>England</HI> before, as I was informed.</P>
<P>The Clothiers lie all along the Banks of this River, for near 20 Miles, and in the Town of <HI>Stroud,</HI> which lies in the middle of it, as al&s;o at <HI>Payn&s;wick,</HI> which I have mentioned before. The River makes its Way to the <HI>Severn,</HI> about Five Miles below <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Tewk&s;bury,</HI> North, it is 12 Miles to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> along the Banks of the <HI>Severn,</HI> where I was wonderfully delighted with the <HI>Hedge-rows,</HI> lin'd all the Way with Apple and Pear-trees, full of Fruit, and tho&s;e &s;o common, that any Pa&s;&s;engers, as they travel the Road, may gather and eat what they plea&s;e. Here al&s;o, as well as in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> you meet with Cyder in the Publick-hou&s;es, &s;old as Beer and Ale is in other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and as cheap.</P>
<P>We &s;aw at a Di&s;tance, in a mo&s;t agreeable Situa|tion, the Seat of Sir <HI>Herbert Perrot Pakington,</HI> a Baronet of a very antient Family.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the <HI>Severn,</HI> at <HI>Whitley-court,</HI> five Miles from <HI>Bewdly,</HI> and &s;even from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> the Lord <HI>Foley</HI> has a Seat, &s;ituate in a large Park.</P>
<P><HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Branonium</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> &s;eems to have been built by them to curb the <HI>Silures</HI> on the other Side of the <HI>Severn,</HI> and in Imitation of the <HI>Roman</HI> Name the <HI>Britons</HI> called it <HI>Caer Wran|gon.</HI> It is &s;ituate in a Valley on the <HI>Severn,</HI> which tho' generally rapid el&s;ewhere, glides on here very gently. It is a large, populous, antient, well-built
<PB N="291" REF="300">
City, and the be&s;t paved in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Foregate-&s;treet</HI> is the mo&s;t regular and beautiful that can be &s;een out of <HI>London.</HI> The <HI>Guild-hall</HI> is a very fine Building; but the Statues on the Out&s;ide di&s;grace it.</P>
<P>There is a good old Stone Bridge over the <HI>Severn,</HI> which &s;tands exceeding high from the Surface of the Water, and has a Tower upon it, &s;aid to be built by the <HI>Romans.</HI> But as the Stream of the <HI>Severn</HI> is contracted here by the Buildings on either Side, there is evident Occa&s;ion &s;ometimes for the Height of the Bridge, the Waters ri&s;ing to an incredible Degree in the Winter-time.</P>
<P>The Commandery here formerly belonging to <HI>St. John's of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Wylde,</HI> and is a fine old Hou&s;e of Timber, in the Form of a Court. The Hall, roof'd with <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Oak, makes one Side of it, built for the Reception of Pilgrims. The Windows are adorn'd with Imagery, and Coats Armorial of &s;tained Gla&s;s. It &s;tands ju&s;t without the South Gate of the City in the <HI>London</HI> Road, where the Heat of the famous Battle happen'd between King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>; and they frequently find Bones of the Slain, on digging in the Garden. Above in the Park is to be &s;een a great Work of Four Ba&s;tions, called <HI>the Royal Mount,</HI> whence a <HI>Vallum</HI> and Ditch run both ways to incompa&s;s this Side of the City. Here, 'tis probable, the Storm began, when the Royali&s;ts were driven back into the City with great Slaughter, and the King e&s;caped being made a Pri&s;oner in the narrow Street at this Gate, by a loaded Cart of Hay pur|po&s;ely overthrown, which gave him time to retire at the oppo&s;ite Gate to <HI>Bo&s;cobel,</HI> or <HI>White Lady's.</HI></P>
<P>A Mile and half above the South Gate, on the Top of the Hall, is the celebrated <HI>Perrywood,</HI> where <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Army lay, and which affords a fine Pro|&s;pect over the County.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="301">The Cathedral is an antient Building. The Body of the Church makes no extraordinary Appearance on the Out&s;ide. The Tower is low, without any Spire, only four very &s;mall Pinacles on the Corners; and yet it has &s;ome little Beauty in it, more than the Church it&s;elf. The upper Part has &s;ome Images in it, but decay'd by Time. In it is bury'd the re&s;tle&s;s King <HI>John</HI>; not where now his Monument &s;tands, which is in the Choir, before the high Altar; but under a little Stone before the Altar of the Ea&s;termo&s;t Wall of the Church. On each Side of him, on the Ground, lie the Effigies of the two Bi&s;hops, his chief Saints, <HI>Wol&s;ton</HI> and <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> from who&s;e Neigh|bourhood he hoped to be &s;afe. The Image of the King probably lay here al&s;o upon the Ground, now elevated upon a Tomb in the &s;aid Choir.</P>
<P>On the South Side of the High Altar is a large and hand&s;ome Stone Chapel over the Monument of Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> elde&s;t Son of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. who died at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> as his Tomb-&s;tone &s;pecifies, <HI>Anno</HI> 1502; and who&s;e Relict <HI>Catharine</HI> Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> his Brother <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. marrying, after 20 Years Wedlock, was divorced from, to make way for <HI>Anna Bolen.</HI> The Choir of this Chapel is exqui&s;ite Workman&s;hip; but &s;uffered much in the late Civil Wars.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o, among other noted Monuments, one for that famous Counte&s;s of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who dancing before <HI>Edward</HI> III. in his great Hall at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> dropt her Garter, which the King taking up, honoured it &s;o much (as the idle Story goes) as to make it the denominating En&s;ign of <HI>The mo&s;t Noble Order of the Garter</HI>; but this I have refuted under my Account of <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> Tho', that the Counte&s;s did drop her Garter, is Fact; and the King might gallantly, to &s;ilence the Je&s;ts and Railleries of the Court, wear it during the Entertainment, in&s;tead of his Garter of the Order. But the Motto was given
<PB N="293" REF="302">
in Allu&s;ion to the Order of Knighthood, and not of the Garter.</P>
<P>The Monument is very fine, and there is this re|markable in it; that there are &s;everal Angels cut in Stone about it, &s;trewing Garters over the Tomb.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other antient Monuments in this Church, which I have not Room to mention.</P>
<P>The Cloi&s;ters are very perfect, and the Chapter-hou&s;e is large, &s;upported, as to its arched Roof, by one umbilical Pillar. 'Tis now become a Library, is well furni&s;h'd, and has many good antient MSS.</P>
<P>There is a large old Gatehou&s;e &s;tanding, and near it the Ca&s;tle with a very high artificial Mount or Keep, nigh the River.</P>
<P>The Bridge I have mention'd has &s;ix Arches, and the Banks of the <HI>Severn</HI> look very beautiful on each Side, being inriched with plea&s;ant Meadows.</P>
<P>This City is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen. It has Two Chamberlains, a Recorder, a Town-clerk, Two Coroners, a Sword-bearer, Four Ser|geants at Mace, and a Sheriff; being, like <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter,</HI> a County of it&s;elf, divided into Seven Wards, in which are Twelve Pari&s;h Churches.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are generally e&s;teem'd rich, being full of Bu&s;ine&s;s, occa&s;ion'd chiefly by the Cloathing-trade, of which the City and the Country round carries on a great Share, as well for the <HI>Turkey</HI> as the Home Trade. The Number of Hands, which it imploys in this Town and adjoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng Villages, in Spinning, Carding, Rowing, Fulling, Weaving, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is almo&s;t incredible. One Part of the Town is wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> People, who &s;peak their own Language, and are imploy'd in this Manufacture. So that this City, which was formerly &s;o great a Griev|ance to the great ones of that Principality, now admini&s;ters Sub&s;i&s;tence to a va&s;t Number of the meaner ones.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="303">It is adorn'd by a capacious and beautiful Structure, called <HI>the Publick Workhou&s;e</HI>; in which Children of both Sexes are trained up to the Knowlege of Trade, and the Practice of Religion and Virtue; by who&s;e Labour al&s;o the Aged and Decrepid are &s;upported. This laudable In&s;titution continued &s;everal Years to the great Benefit of the City, till at la&s;t the Guardians of it having contracted a Debt of upwards of 300<HI>l.</HI> they returned the Poor back to their re&s;pective Pari&s;hes; and the whole Charity being fru&s;trated, and put an End to, the Corporation let out the Building for a Hop-market, Warehou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to pay the incurr'd Debt, either Principal or Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Hereupon their worthy Repre&s;entative <HI>Samuel Sandys,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and other Gentlemen, procured an Act of Parliament for re&s;toring it to its fir&s;t laudable End; which Act took place from <HI>June</HI> 1730, and will be a la&s;ting Monument to the Honour of the di&s;intere&s;ted and publick-&s;pirited Gentleman, to who&s;e unwearied Application, and inflexible Re&s;olution, it was owing: for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that alienated Charities are &s;ome of the harde&s;t things in the World to be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to this Workhou&s;e, <HI>Robert Berkley,</HI> of <HI>Spetchley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> erected a fine Ho&s;pital for Twelve poor Men, and gave 2000<HI>l.</HI> to build it, and 4000<HI>l.</HI> to endow it.</P>
<P>Here are be&s;ides Three Grammar-&s;chools, and Seven Alms-hou&s;es, all liberally indow'd. <HI>St. Nicolas</HI> Church, in this City, has been lately re|built, and is a neat and commodious Edifice.</P>
<P>And the Church of <HI>All-&s;aints</HI> in this Town be|ing in &s;o ruinous a Condition, that Part of it actually fell down; and the re&s;t being ready to fall, an Act pa&s;&s;ed, Se&s;&s;. 1737-8, for taking down and rebuilding the &s;ame.</P>
<P>From <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> I made &s;ome Excur&s;ions, to vi&s;it the Towns and Country Northward; and fir&s;t came
<PB N="295" REF="304">
to <HI>Droitwych,</HI> a corporate Bailiwick-town, which has Four Churches, and is pretty wealthy.

The Salt Springs are very good, and productive of Plenty of Brine; and the Town lies on the River <HI>Salwarp.</HI></P>
<P>Proceeding directly on, in the Road, we arrived at <HI>Broom&s;grove,</HI> a large Bailiwick-town, likewi&s;e on the River <HI>Salwarp,</HI> where the Clothing-trade is pretty bri&s;kly carried on.

<P>Between <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Spetchley</HI> was <HI>St. O&s;wald</HI>'s Ho&s;pital, demoli&s;hed in the Reign of Queen <HI>Eliza|beth.</HI> But Dr. <HI>Fell,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford,</HI> after the Re&s;toration, recover'd much of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and erected a fair and large Ho&s;pital, which comfortably maintains Twelve poor Men.</P>
<P><HI>Kiddermin&s;ter</HI> is a Town in this County of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> very con&s;iderable for its Woollen Trade, particularly the Weaving of what they call Lind&s;ey-wool&s;ey, in which the Inhabitants are almo&s;t wholly imploy'd. It is a large, but yet compact and popu|lous Town, &s;ituated on the <HI>Stour,</HI> and govern'd by a Bailiff, Twelve Capital Burge&s;&s;es, Twenty-five Common-council-men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In its Church is a cro&s;s-legg'd Monument of Sir <HI>Thomas Acton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stourbridge</HI> is al&s;o &s;ituate upon the River <HI>Stour,</HI> over which it has a very good Bridge, whence its Name. This Town deals greatly in Gla&s;s Manu|facture of all Sorts, and al&s;o in Iron Works of all Sorts; and is va&s;tly improved of late Years, both in Hou&s;es and Inhabitants.

<P><HI>Birmingham</HI> is a very populous Town, and full of Iron Manufactories, e&s;pecially of the &s;maller Sorts; in which the Inhabitants &s;o greatly excel, that their Works are carried to all Parts of the World in great Quantities. The Town is, of late Years, greatly improved and inlarged by many new Buildings both publick and private; particularly a new Church built by virtue of an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the 7th of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> which is dedicated to St. <HI>Philip.</HI> This Town is in <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> on the Borders of this County, &s;ituated on the Side of a Hill, and has a mo&s;t plentiful Market.</P>
<P>A little below <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> We&s;tward, the <HI>Severn</HI> receives a River of a long deep Cour&s;e, which comes from <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> called the <HI>Teme,</HI> on which &s;tands a &s;mall Market-town called <HI>Tenbury,</HI> but of little Note.

called <HI>Monmouth Caps,</HI> and noted for the Palace which King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. built here for his Son Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> called <HI>Tickenhall.</HI> It had a very fine Park about it, which, with the Hou&s;e, was de&s;troy'd by the furious Enthu&s;ia&s;ts in the Civil War.</P>
<P>A Mile off is <HI>Ribsford,</HI> the Seat of Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> of <HI>Cherbury,</HI> plea&s;antly &s;urrounded with Woods. Here is a good Picture of <HI>William</HI> the Fir&s;t Earl of <HI>Pembroke.</HI></P>
<P>The Ends of the Hills towards the River are ge|nerally Rocks: and <HI>Black&s;ton-hill</HI> has an Hermitage cut out of it, with a Chapel, and &s;everal Apartments. Near it is a pretty Rock upon the Edge of the Water, covered with Oaks, and many curious Plants.</P>

The Situation is plea|&s;ant, the Air healthy, the Pro&s;pect delightful and com|modious for Trade. It hath been fortified with Walls and a Ca&s;tle, which are now in Ruins; and the Area in the la&s;t is converted to a fine Bowling-green. The Streets are many, and well paved. It is go|verned by a Bailiff, Twenty-four Aldermen, and other

inferior Officers. It is noted for good Gun-makers and its Stocken Manufacture. It has a well-repleni&s;hed Market, and Five Fairs annually, Two whereof hold Three Days, which are much re&s;orted to, and abound with Hor&s;es, Black Cattle, Sheep, Butter, Chee&s;e, Bacon, Linen Cloth, and Hops, in great Plenty. Here are Two Churches, and tho' the Pari&s;hes are large, and the Town very populous, are very indifferently indowed, and &s;o is the Free-&s;chool. There is a hollow Way cut thro' the Rock, leading from the high Town to the Bridge, of the Depth of 20 Feet, in &s;ome Parts of it, and likewi&s;e many Vaults and Dwellings are hewn out of the Rock.</P>
<P>From hence we advanced in the direct Road to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and came to <HI>Great Wenlock,</HI> an antient incorporated Town, governed by a Bailiff and Bur|ge&s;&s;es; but noted for nothing extraordinary.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> for my Ob&s;ervation at my Re|turn from <HI>Wales</HI> thro' <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> we turn'd &s;hort here, and fell down Southward to <HI>Ludlow,</HI> famed more for its Beauty than Antiquity; for it &s;eems, the Ca&s;tle, which was &s;o truly magnificent, was built by <HI>Roger de Montgomery</HI> in the <HI>Conqueror</HI>'s Time.</P>
<P>But before I &s;peak more of this Ca&s;tle, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that on the Extremity of this County, in a kind of Promontory, which runs in between <HI>Montgo|mery&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Radnor&s;hire,</HI> upon the <HI>Clun,</HI> lies.</P>
<P><HI>Bi&s;hops Ca&s;tle,</HI> a &s;mall Market Bailiwick Town; and not very far from it, ju&s;t at the Entrance into <HI>Montgomery&s;hire,</HI> is a noted Place called <HI>Bi&s;hops|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ott</HI>; where is an Acre of Ground &s;urrounded with an Intrenchment. The <HI>Clun</HI> meets the <HI>Teme</HI> at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> and both, united, run to <HI>Clebury,</HI> a &s;mall Town on the Borders of <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> where it falls, as I mentioned before, into the <HI>Severn.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ludlow</HI> &s;hews plainly in its Decay, what it was in its flouri&s;hing E&s;tate: it is the Palace of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> in Right of his Principality.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="308">Its Situation is indeed mo&s;t beautiful; there is a mo&s;t &s;pacious Plain or Lawn in its Front, which formerly continued near Two Miles; but much of it is now inclo&s;ed. The Country round it is exceeding plea&s;ant, fertile, populous, and the Soil rich; nothing can be added by Nature, to make it a Place fit for a Royal Palace. It is built in the North-we&s;t Angle of the Town upon a Rock, commanding a delightful Pro&s;pect Northward; and on the We&s;t is &s;haded by a lofty Hill, and wa&s;hed by the River. The Battle|ments are of great Height and Thickne&s;s, with Towers at convenient Di&s;tances. That Half which is within the Walls of the Town, is &s;ecured with a deep Ditch; the other is founded on a &s;olid Rock. A Chapel here has abundance of Coats of Arms upon the Panels, as has the Hall, together with Lances, Spears, Firelocks, and old Armour.</P>
<P>It will be no Wonder, that this noble Ca&s;tle is in the very Perfection of Decay, when we acquaint our Readers, that the pre&s;ent Inhabitants live upon the Sale of the antient Materials. All the fine Courts, the Royal Apartments, Halls, and Rooms of State, lie open, abandon'd, and &s;ome of them falling down; for &s;ince the Courts of the Pre&s;ident and Marches are taken away, here is nothing that requires the Attendance of any publick People; &s;o that Time, the great Devourer of the Works of Men, begins to eat into the very Stone Walls, and to &s;pread the Face of Ruin upon the whole Fabrick. Over &s;everal of the Stable-doors are the Arms of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Ludlow</HI> is likewi&s;e fortify'd with Walls, thro' which are Seven Gates. It is well-built, and a Place of good Trade; but, to be &s;ure, it is not the better for the ruinous State of the Ca&s;tle, and the aboli&s;hing of the Court held there for the Marches. It &s;tands on the Edge of the two Coun|ties,
<PB N="300" REF="309">
<HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> but is it&s;elf in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>On the South-&s;ide of the Town runs the <HI>Teme,</HI> over which is a good Bridge. The River has &s;everal Dams acro&s;s it, in the Nature of Cataracts, whereby abundance of Mills are turn'd; and great is the Roar of the &s;uperfluous Waters.</P>
<P><HI>Ludlow</HI> has a very good Church with an hand&s;ome Tower, and a plea&s;ant Ring of Six Bells. The Windows are full of painted Gla&s;s pretty intire.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome old Monuments of the Lords Pre&s;idents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and an In&s;cription upon the North Wall of the Choir, relating to Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> elder Brother to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who died here, and in this Spot his Bowels were depo&s;ited. It is &s;aid, That his Heart was taken up &s;ome time ago in a leaden Box.</P>
<P>In the Ea&s;tern Angle of the Choir is a Clo&s;et, antiently called <HI>The Godhou&s;e,</HI> where the Prie&s;ts &s;e|cured their con&s;ecrated Uten&s;ils. The Window is &s;trongly barred on the Out&s;ide. The Church is de|dicated to St. <HI>Laurence</HI>: and in the Market-place is a Ci&s;tern or Conduit, on the Top of which is a long Stone Cro&s;s, bearing a Niche, in which is the Image of that Saint.</P>
<P>We&s;t of the Church was a College, now con|verted to a private Hou&s;e. There was a rich Priory out of the Town, on the North Side of which are but few Ruins to be &s;een, except a &s;mall Church, which formerly belonged to it. The <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> call this Town <HI>Lye Twy&s;oy,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Prince's Court.</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls the River <HI>Teme</HI> the <HI>Tem'd,</HI> and another River which joins it ju&s;t at this Town, the <HI>Corve,</HI> whence the rich flat Country below the Town is call'd <HI>Corve&s;dale.</HI> It is governed by Two Bailiffs, Twelve Aldermen, a Recorder, Twenty-five Common-council-men, and other inferior Officers; and has the particular Privilege of trying and executing
<PB N="301" REF="310">
Criminals. It has an Alms-hou&s;e for 30 poor People.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. e&s;tabli&s;h'd here the Court of the Pre&s;ident and Council of the Marches, before-men|tioned, and all Cau&s;es of <HI>Ni&s;i prius,</HI> or of Civil Right, were try'd here, before the Lord Pre&s;ident and Coun|cil; but this Court, being grown a great Grievance to the Publick, was intirely taken away by Act of Parlia|ment, in the fir&s;t Year of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Ludlow,</HI> we took our Cour&s;e &s;till due South to <HI>Lem&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>Leomin&s;ter,</HI> a large Market-town on the River <HI>Lug,</HI> over which it hath &s;everal Bridges. 'Tis governed by a Bailiff. The Church, which is very large, has been in a manner rebuilt, and is now very beautiful. This Town is noted for its fine Wool, and the be&s;t Wheat, and con&s;equently the fine&s;t Bread; and al&s;o for the be&s;t Barley, whence <HI>Lem&s;ter Bread,</HI> and <HI>Weobly Ale,</HI> are become a pro|verbial Saying.</P>
<P>It is a Town of bri&s;k Trade in Wool, Hat-making, Leather, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and lies in a Valley exceedingly luxu|riant. Three Rivers of a very &s;wift Current go thro' the Town, be&s;ides others very near. The Inhabitants make great u&s;e of the&s;e by Mills, and other Machinery in the various Branches of their Trade. On the North-&s;ide of the Church was a con&s;iderable Priory, Two Ayles of which belong now to the Church, and Two others of more light&s;ome Work have been added. The Mayor has a long black Rod to walk with, tipt with Silver. There are &s;ome poor Remains of the Priory, chiefly a little Chapel, which probably be|long'd to the Prior's Family. Underneath it runs a pretty Rivulet, which us'd to grind his Corn, now converted to a Fulling-mill. Near it are very large Ponds for Fi&s;h, which u&s;ed to furni&s;h the Monks on fa&s;ting Days. There was a fine Gate-hou&s;e, pull'd
<PB N="302" REF="311">
down not long ago, near the <HI>Ambry</HI> or <HI>Almery</HI> Clo&s;e, where they gave their Scraps away to the Poor.</P>
<P><HI>Pembridge, Weobly,</HI> and <HI>Kyneton</HI> lie South-we&s;t of <HI>Lem&s;ter,</HI> and form in their Situation a kind of Triangle. They are all Market-Towns, and the fir&s;t is pretty con&s;iderable for the Cloathing Trade; the &s;econd for Ale; but the third for nothing that I know of.</P>
<P>The County on our right, as we came from <HI>Lud|low,</HI> is very fruitful and plea&s;ant, and is called the Hundred of <HI>Wigmore,</HI> from which the Earl of <HI>Ox|ford</HI> takes the Title of Baron. Here we &s;aw the two antient Ca&s;tles of <HI>Brampton Brian,</HI> and <HI>Wigmore,</HI> both belonging to the late Earl's Grandfather, Sir <HI>Ed|ward Harley. Brampton</HI> is a &s;tately Pile, but not kept in full Repair. The Parks are fine, and full of large Timber.</P>
<P>We were now on the Borders of <HI>Wales,</HI> properly &s;o called; for from the Windows of <HI>Brampton-Ca&s;tle,</HI> you have a fair Pro&s;pect into the County of <HI>Radnor,</HI> which is, as it were, under its Walls; nay, even this whole County of <HI>Hereford</HI> was a Part of <HI>Wales,</HI> and &s;o deem'd for many Ages. The People of this County too boa&s;t, that they were a Part of the an|tient <HI>Silures,</HI> who for &s;o many Ages with&s;tood the <HI>Roman</HI> Arms, and could never be intirely conquer'd. They are a diligent and laborious People, chiefly ad|dicted to Hu&s;bandry; and they boa&s;t, that they have the fine&s;t Wool, the be&s;t Hops, and the riche&s;t Cyder in all <HI>Britain</HI>; and po&s;&s;ibly with &s;ome Rea&s;on; for the Wool about <HI>Leomin&s;ter,</HI> and in the Hundred of <HI>Wigmore,</HI> and the <HI>Golden Vale,</HI> as it is call'd for its Richne&s;s, on the Banks of the River <HI>Dove,</HI> (all in this County) is as fine as any in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>South-down</HI> Wool not excepted. As for <HI>Hops,</HI> they plant abundance all over this County, and they are very good. And for <HI>Cyder,</HI> it is the common Drink of the County, and is &s;o very good, and &s;o cheap, that
<PB N="303" REF="312">
we never found fault, though we could get no other Drink for Twenty Miles together. Great Quanti|ties of this Cyder are &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> even by Land-Carriage, though &s;o very remote, which is an Evi|dence in its Favour beyond Contradiction.</P>
<P>One would hardly expect &s;o plea&s;ant and fruitful a Country as this, &s;o near the barren Mountains of <HI>Wales</HI>; but 'tis certain, that not any of our Southern Counties, the Neighbourhood of <HI>London</HI> excepted, come up to the Fertility of this County.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI> it is Ten Miles to <HI>Hereford,</HI> the chief City, not of this County only, but of all the Counties We&s;t of the <HI>Severn.</HI> In the time of the late Civil Wars it was very &s;trong, and being well fortify'd, and as well defended, &s;upported a tedious and very &s;evere Siege; for be&s;ides the Parliament's Forces, who could never reduce it, the <HI>Scots</HI> Army was call'd to the Work, who lay before it, till they laid above 4000 of their Bones there, and at la&s;t it was rather &s;urrendered by the fatal I&s;&s;ue of the War, than by the Attack of the Be&s;iegers.</P>
<P>It had before this Six Pari&s;h-churches; but Two of them were demoli&s;h'd at that time. It has an Ho&s;pital liberally endow'd for 12 poor People.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Hereford</HI> probably &s;prung from the Ruins of the <HI>Roman Ariconium,</HI> now <HI>Kenche&s;ter,</HI> three Miles off, higher up the River <HI>Wye,</HI> but not very near it, which may be a Rea&s;on for its Decay.</P>
<P><HI>Kenche&s;ter</HI> &s;tands upon a little Brook, call'd the <HI>Ine,</HI> which thence encompa&s;&s;ing the Walls of <HI>Here|ford,</HI> falls into the <HI>Wye.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Archenfield</HI> &s;eems to retain the Name of <HI>Ariconium.</HI> Nothing remains of its Splendor, but a Piece of a Temple, probably, with a Nich which is Five Feet high, and Three broad within, built of Brick, Stone, and indi&s;&s;oluble Mortar. There are many large Foundations near it. A very fine <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Floor, a few Years ago, was found intire, which was &s;oon
<PB N="304" REF="313">
torn to Pieces by the ignorant Country-people. A Bath was here found by Sir <HI>John Ho&s;kyns</HI> about Seven Feet &s;quare, the Pipes of Lead intire: tho&s;e of Brick were a Foot long, Three Inches &s;quare, let ar|tificially into one another; over the&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, was a Pavement.</P>
<P>This, as Dr. <HI>Stukeley</HI> ob&s;erves, is an excellent Invention for heating a Room, and might well be introduced among us in Winter-time.</P>
<P>In another Place is a Hollow, where burnt Wheat has been taken up. All around the City you may ea&s;ily trace the Walls, &s;ome Stones being left every|where, tho' over-grown by Hedges and Timber|trees. The Situation of the Place is a gentle Emi|nence of a &s;quari&s;h Form; the Earth black and rich, overgrown with Brambles, Oak-trees, full of Stones, Foundations, and Cavities, where they have been digging, and found many Coins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Colonel <HI>Dant|&s;ey</HI> has pav'd a Cellar with &s;quare Bricks dug up here. The Earl of <HI>Coning&s;by</HI> has adorn'd the Floor of his Evidence-room with them.</P>
<P>This City is overlook'd and &s;helter'd towards the North with a prodigious Mountain of &s;teep A&s;cent; on the Top &s;tands a va&s;t Camp, with Works altoge|ter inacce&s;&s;ible, which is call'd <HI>Credon-hill.</HI> At the Summit, you are pre&s;ented with the mo&s;t glorious and exten&s;ive Pro&s;pect, as far as <HI>St. Michael's Mount,</HI> in <HI>Monmouth&s;hire</HI>; crown'd with Two Tops, and of con&s;iderable Re&s;ort among Zealots of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Per&s;ua&s;ion, who believe this holy Hill was &s;ent hither by St. <HI>Patrick</HI> out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that it works Won|ders in &s;everal Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, is the va&s;t Black Mountain, which &s;eparates <HI>Brecknock&s;hire</HI> from this County. The Town underneath appears like a little Cop&s;e. <HI>Dinder-hill,</HI> whereon is a <HI>Roman</HI> Camp, &s;tands on the contrary Bank of the <HI>Wye.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="314">And upon the <HI>Lug</HI> are <HI>Sutton-walls,</HI> another va&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> Camp upon a Hill overlooking a beautiful Vale, which was the regal Re&s;idence of the power|ful King <HI>Offa</HI>; but chiefly remarkable for the Mur|der of young King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> whom he allur'd thither under Pretext of courting his Daughter, and who was buried in the neighbouring Church of <HI>Marden,</HI> &s;ituate in a Mar&s;h by the River-&s;ide. Hence his Body was afterwards convey'd to <HI>Hereford,</HI> and en&s;hrin'd; but the particular Place cannot be found.</P>
<P>In the North Wing of the Cathedral of <HI>Hereford,</HI> is the Shrine, where the Body of <HI>Cantilupe,</HI> the great Miracle-monger in the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> was depo|&s;ited; which Wing was built by him&s;elf, and on the Wall his Picture is painted. All round are the Marks of Hooks, where the Banners, Lamps, Re|liques, and the like Pre&s;ents were hung up. And the Riches of this Place were doubtle&s;s very con&s;i|derable; for it is well guarded again&s;t the A&s;&s;aults of Thieves. The Shrine is of Stone, carv'd round with Knights in Armour.</P>
<P>The Church is very old and &s;tately. The Spire is not high, but hand&s;ome, and there is a fine Tower at the We&s;t End. The Roof, Ayles, and Chapel, have been added to the more antient Part by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Bi&s;hops, as al&s;o the Towers, Cloi&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Choir, tho' plain, is hand&s;ome, and there is a very good Organ.</P>
<P>The Chapter-hou&s;e, which was very beautiful, was de&s;troy'd in the Civil Wars. About Four Win|dows are left &s;tanding; and the Springing of the Stone Arches between, are of fine Ribwork, which compos'd the Roof, of that Sort of Architecture, wherewith <HI>King's-college-chapel</HI> was built. Two Windows were pull'd down by Bi&s;hop <HI>Bi&s;&s;e,</HI> which he us'd in new fitting up the Epi&s;copal Palace. Under the Windows, in every Compartiment, was painted a King, Bi&s;hop, Saint, Virgin, or the like; &s;ome
<PB N="306" REF="315">
of which were di&s;tinct enough, tho' &s;o long expos'd to the Weather.</P>
<P>Here are a great Number of Monuments of Bi&s;hops, and many valuable Bra&s;&s;es and Tombs.</P>
<P>Between the Cathedral and Palace, is a mo&s;t vene|rable Pile, built and roof'd with Stone, con&s;i&s;ting of Two Chapels, one above the other; the upper dedi|cated to St. <HI>Magdalen</HI>; the lower, which is &s;ome Steps under-ground, to St. <HI>Catharine.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle was a noble Work, built by one of the <HI>Edwards</HI> before the Conque&s;t, &s;trongly wall'd and ditch'd. There is a very lofty artificial Keep, having a Well fac'd with good Stone: and by the Side of the Ditch a Spring con&s;ecrated to St. <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> with an old Stone Arch.</P>
<P>Without the Walls are the Ruins of <HI>Black-Friers</HI> Mona&s;tery, and a pretty Stone Cro&s;s intire; round which the Cloi&s;ters were originally built, as now the Cloi&s;ters of the Cathedral inclo&s;e another &s;uch. The&s;e Cro&s;&s;es were in the nature of a Pulpit, whence a Monk preach'd to the People in the open Air, as now practis'd in the Cloi&s;ters of &s;ome Colleges in the Univer&s;ities once a Year.</P>
<P>The neighbouring Hill, call'd <HI>Dynmaur,</HI> or <HI>The great Hill,</HI> makes amends for the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of climbing it, by the Plea&s;ure we receive from its woody Cre&s;t, and exten&s;ive Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>At the City of <HI>Hereford,</HI> we could not but in|quire into the Truth of the Story &s;o famous, that the Right Reverend Bi&s;hop <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> has mention'd it in his Continuation of <HI>Camden,</HI> of the removing the Two great Stones near <HI>Sutton</HI>; which the People confirm'd to us. The Story is thus:</P>
<P>Between <HI>Sutton</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI> in a common Mea|dow call'd the <HI>Wergins,</HI> were plac'd Two large Stones for a Water-mark; one erected upright, and the other laid athwart. In the late Civil Wars, about the Year 1652, they remov'd to about twelve&s;core
<PB N="307" REF="316">
Paces Di&s;tance, and nobody knew how; which gave occa&s;ion to a vulgar Notion, That they were carried thither by the Devil. When they were &s;et in their Places again, one of them requir'd nine Yoke of Oxen to draw it.</P>
<P><HI>Lidbury</HI> lies Ea&s;tward of <HI>Hereford,</HI> near the South End of the <HI>Malvern</HI> Hills. It is a fine, well-built Market-town, &s;ituate in rich clayey Grounds, and much inhabited by Clothiers. Here is an Ho&s;pital for the Poor, well indowed.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Lidbury,</HI> is <HI>Colwal</HI>; near which, upon the Wa&s;te, as a Countryman was digging a Ditch about his Cottage, he found a Crown or a Coronet of Gold, with Gems &s;et deep in it. It was of a Size large enough to be drawn over the Arm with the Sleeve. The Stones of it are &s;aid to have been &s;o valuable, as to be &s;old by a Jeweller for One thou|&s;and Five hundred Pounds.</P>
<P><HI>Hereford,</HI> tho' a large and populous City, may yet be &s;aid to be old, mean-built, and very dirty, lying low, and on the Bank of the <HI>Wye,</HI> which &s;ome|times incommodes them very much, by the violent Fre&s;hes that come down from the Mountains of <HI>Wales</HI>; for all the Rivers of this County, except the <HI>Diffrin-Doe,</HI> come out of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>One thing remarkable, which we mu&s;t not omit, is, that the College &s;till retains its Foundation Laws, and the Re&s;identiaries are oblig'd to Celibacy; but otherwi&s;e, they live a very happy, ea&s;y, and plentiful Life; being furni&s;h'd upon the Foot of the Founda|tion, be&s;ides their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Stipends.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Year 1738, they began to pull down the old <HI>Gothick</HI> Chapel belonging to the Bi&s;hop's Palace at <HI>Hereford,</HI> in order to erect a Pile in a politer Ta&s;te, for the publick Service. The demoli&s;h'd Chapel was &s;aid to be as old as the Con|que&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="317">Between <HI>Leomin&s;ter</HI> and this City, is another <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> the Seat of the late Earl of <HI>Coning&s;by.</HI> That Lord was, from an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Peer, made an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> one, by his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>George</HI> I.

<P>The Windows of the Chapel are well painted: there are &s;ome Statues of the <HI>Coning&s;bies.</HI></P>
<P>Here are two new Stone Stair-ca&s;es, after a Geo|metrical Method. The Record-room is at-top of a Tower arch'd with Stone, pav'd with <HI>Roman</HI> Brick, and has an Iron Door.

<P>The Park is very fine, Eight Miles in Circum|ference, and contains about 1200 Head of Deer.

<P>From hence we came at about Eight Miles more into <HI>Monmouth&s;hire,</HI> formerly a <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> but now an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> County, and to the Town of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> It is a Place of great Antiquity, and is fair, large, and well-built, &s;ituate at the Conflux of the <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Munnow,</HI> whence the Town has its Name; it &s;tands in the Angle where the Rivers join, and has a Bridge over each River, and a third over the River <HI>Trothy,</HI> which comes in ju&s;t below the other.</P>
<P>This Town &s;hews Marks of great Antiquity, and, by the Remains of Walls, Lines, Curtains, and Ba&s;|tions, that it has been very &s;trong, and, by its Situa|tion, that it may be made &s;o again. It is a Borough-town, govern'd by Two Bailiffs, Common-council|men, and Town-clerk. It has a very con&s;iderable Corn-market. It was famed for the Strength of the
<PB N="310" REF="319">
Ca&s;tle in the Time of <HI>William</HI> I.; and is the Birth-place of our renown'd King <HI>Henry</HI> V. Conqueror of <HI>France</HI>; and likewi&s;e of one of our antient Hi&s;to|rians, <HI>Jeoffry</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> a fabulous Writer. At pre&s;ent 'tis not very flouri&s;hing; yet it drives a con|&s;iderable Trade with the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> by the Na|vigation of the <HI>Wye.</HI></P>
<P>This River having receiv'd Two large Streams, the <HI>Munnow,</HI> and the <HI>Trother,</HI> becomes a very noble River; and with a deep Chanel, and a full Current, hurries away towards the Sea, carrying al&s;o Ve&s;&s;els of a con&s;iderable Burden hereabouts.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Beaufort</HI> has a fine Seat, call'd <HI>Troy-hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Lower down, upon the <HI>Wye</HI> in this Shire, &s;tands <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> the Sea-port for all the Towns &s;eated on this River and the <HI>Lug,</HI> and where their Commerce &s;eems to centre. Hither Ships of good Burden may come up, and the Tide runs with the &s;ame impe|tuous Current as at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; the Flood ri&s;ing ordi|narily from Six Fathom, to Six and a half at <HI>Chep&s;tow</HI> Bridge, which is a noble one indeed, built of Tim|ber, and no le&s;s than 70 Feet high from the Surface of the Water, when the Tide is out. And that this was not a needle&s;s Height, was evident in <HI>Ja|nuary</HI> 1738, when the Water ro&s;e at the Bridge up|wards of 70 Feet, and very much damag'd it: one Man lo&s;t above 130 Head of Cattle, which, with other Damages it did there, and in the adjacent Places, were computed at 7 or 8000<HI>l. Chep&s;tow</HI> has a well frequented Market, e&s;pecially for Corn. The Bridge, as half of it is in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> is maintained at the Expence of both Counties.</P>
<P>Two Miles from this Town is the famous Pa&s;&s;age over the <HI>Severn,</HI> on this Side call'd <HI>Bleachly,</HI> and on the other <HI>Au&s;t,</HI> as I have mention'd before. Here <HI>Offa's Dyke</HI> begins, and pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Radnor|&s;hire,</HI>
<PB N="311" REF="320">
extends it&s;elf up to <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> and &s;o to the River <HI>Dee,</HI> which parts <HI>Wales</HI> from <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>We turn'd Northwards, and arrived at <HI>Aberga|venny,</HI> which is a large well-built and well-inhabited Market-town, &s;ituate at the Mouth of the <HI>Gavenny</HI> running into the <HI>U&s;k.</HI> It carries on a con&s;iderable Trade in Flanels, which the Country People manu|facture at home, and bring hither to &s;ell. It is a great Thorough-fare from the We&s;tern Parts of <HI>Wales</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Bath</HI> by <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> and to <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> by <HI>Monmouth</HI>; and &s;o cro&s;&s;ing the River thro' <HI>Col|ford</HI> and the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dean.</HI></P>
<P>The Fuel in this County is Pit-coal, and is very cheap, in&s;omuch that they &s;ell a Hor&s;e-load for Two-pence, at the Pit-mouth; and 'tis common, in the meane&s;t Cot to &s;ee a good Fire.</P>
<P>Great Quantities of Corn are exported out of this County; and 'tis frequent, that the <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Mer|chants &s;end their Ships hither to load for <HI>Portugal,</HI> and other foreign Countries. And indeed it is noted for producing as good Wheat and other Grain, as any County in the Kingdom; and yet it is very &s;urpri&s;e|ing, that Lands here never &s;ell for more than 20 or 21 Years Purchace. The current Language of the County is <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> among the Vulgar, but the Gen|tlemen &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> generally.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. CONTAINING A De&s;cription of the greate&s;t Part of the Principality of <HI>Wales.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Thought I &s;hould not pay the Princi|pality the Re&s;pect it &s;o well de&s;erves, if I did not begin a Letter with the De&s;cription of it; it being the Country of that brave People, who had an ori|ginal Right to the whole I&s;land, and made &s;o noble a Stand in Defence of their Liberties and Independ|ency; and at la&s;t, rather than &s;ubmit to a foreign Yoke, cho&s;e to be free in this remote and inacce&s;&s;ible Part of it.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t Counties which border We&s;t upon <HI>Monmouth&s;hire,</HI> are <HI>Brecknock</HI> and <HI>Glamorgan,</HI> and are very mountainous on the Ea&s;t Side, which gives a Traveller a terrible Apprehen&s;ion of the Country he is this way entering into, and an Expectation of meeting with nothing that is agreeable; but he is not long before he is undeceived, and finds the Re|ward of his Trouble. In that Part of <HI>Monmouth&s;hire</HI> which joins the Two Counties, begins the ri&s;ing of
<PB N="313" REF="322">
the Hills. <HI>Kyrton-Beacon, Tumberlow, Blorench, Penvail,</HI> and <HI>Skirridan,</HI> are &s;ome of the Names of the&s;e horrid Mountains, and are all in this Shire; and I could not but fan&s;y my&s;elf in View of <HI>Mount Brennus, Little-Barnard,</HI> and <HI>Great-Barnard,</HI> among the <HI>Alps.</HI></P>
<P>We now entered <HI>South Wales</HI>; which contains the Shires of <HI>Glamorgan, Brecknock, Radnor, Caermar|then, Pembroke,</HI> and <HI>Cardigan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brecknock&s;hire</HI> is a mere inland County, as <HI>Radnor</HI> is; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> je&s;tingly (and I think not very impro|perly) call it <HI>Break-neck-&s;hire:</HI> 'tis mountainous to an Extremity, except on the Side of <HI>Radnor,</HI> where it is &s;omething more low and level. It is well wa|tered by the <HI>Wye,</HI> and the <HI>U&s;ke,</HI> two Rivers men|tion'd before. Upon the latter &s;tands the Town of <HI>Brecknock,</HI> the Capital of the County, well-built, and the A&s;&s;izes are kept at it. It is very antient, and indeed, to mention it here once for all, there are more Tokens of Antiquity to be &s;een every-where in <HI>Wales,</HI> than in any particular Part of <HI>England,</HI> ex|cept the Counties of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland.</HI> Here we &s;aw <HI>Brecknock-mere,</HI> a large or long Lake of Water, Two or Three Miles over; of which they have a great many Fables, not worth relating: the be&s;t of them is, that a certain River, call'd the <HI>Lhe|weni,</HI> runs thro' it, and keeps its Colour in Mid|chanel, di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Water of the Lake, and, as they &s;ay, never mingles with it. They take abundance of good Fi&s;h in this Lake, &s;o that, like the River <HI>Thei&s;&s;e,</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> they &s;ay it is Two-thirds Water, and One-third Fi&s;h. The Country People affirm, that once a City &s;tood here, but, that by the Judgment of Heaven, for the Sins of its Inhabitants, it &s;unk into the Earth, and the Wa|ter ro&s;e up in the Place of it. I ob&s;erve the &s;ame Story is mention'd by Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> with &s;ome Dif|ference in the Particulars: I believe my Share of it,
<PB N="314" REF="323">
but 'tis remarkable, that Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> having lo&s;t the old City <HI>Loventium,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> to be hereabouts, is willing to account for it by this odd Story.</P>
<P>It was among the Mountains of this County that the famous <HI>Glendower</HI> &s;helter'd him&s;elf, and taking Arms on the depo&s;ing <HI>Richard</HI> II. proclaimed him|&s;elf Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>; they &s;hew us &s;everal little Re|fuges of his in the Mountains, whither he retreated; and from whence, again, he made &s;uch bold Excur|&s;ions into <HI>England,</HI> as to have put <HI>Henry</HI> IV. to very great Difficulties.</P>
<P>Tho' this County be &s;o mountainous, Provi&s;ions are exceeding plentiful, and al&s;o very good all over the Country; nor are the&s;e Mountains u&s;ele&s;s, even to the City of <HI>London,</HI> as I have noted of other Counties; for from hence they &s;end yearly great Herds of Black Cattle to <HI>England,</HI> and which are known to fill our Fairs and Markets, even that of <HI>Smithfield</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The yellow Mountains of <HI>Radnor&s;hire</HI> are the &s;ame, and their Product of Cattle is the &s;ame; nor did I meet with any thing worth noticing, except Mo|numents of Antiquity. The Stories of <HI>Vortigern,</HI> and <HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Mortimer,</HI> are in every old Woman's Mouth here. There is here a great Cataract or Water-fall of the River <HI>Wye,</HI> at a Place call'd <HI>Rha|jadr Gwy</HI> in <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Cataract or Water-fall of the <HI>Wye</HI>; but we did not go to &s;ee it, by rea&s;on there was a great Flood out at that time, which made the Way dangerous. There &s;eemed to us a kind of De&s;art too, on that Side, which is &s;carce pa&s;&s;able by Strangers; &s;o we made it our North Boundary for this Part of our Journey.</P>
<P>We &s;hall only add; That <HI>Radnor</HI> is the Shire Town, and hath a Ca&s;tle; that <HI>Pre&s;teigne</HI> in <HI>Radnor|&s;hire</HI> is a well-built Town, and the A&s;&s;izes are held there.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="324">Entering <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire,</HI> from <HI>Radnor</HI> and <HI>Breck|nock,</HI> we beheld <HI>Monuchdenny-hill</HI> on our Left, and the <HI>Black Mountains</HI> on the Right, and all a Ridge of horrid Rocks and Precipices between, over which, if we had not had good Guides, we &s;hould never have found our Way; and indeed, we began to repent our Curio&s;ity, in going out of the common Road, as not having met with any thing worth the Trouble; and the Country looking &s;o full of Horror, we thought to have given over the Enterprize, and have left <HI>Wales</HI> out of our Circuit: But after a Day and a Night engaging thus with Rocks and Mountains, our Guide brought us down into a mo&s;t agreeable Vale, opening to the South, and a plea&s;ant River running through it, call'd the <HI>Taaffe</HI>; and following its Cour&s;e, we came in the Evening to the antient City of <HI>Landaff,</HI> and Town of <HI>Caerdiff,</HI> &s;tanding almo&s;t together.</P>
<P><HI>Landaff</HI> in <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire,</HI> is the Seat of the Epi|&s;copal See, and a City; but &s;o &s;mall, that it has not a Market; but <HI>Caerdiff,</HI> which is lower on the River, is the Port and Town of Trade; and has a very good Harbour opening into the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, about four Miles below the Town.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is a neat Building, and very an|tient; they boa&s;t that this Church was a Hou&s;e of Religious Wor&s;hip many Years before any other was founded in the I&s;land, and that the Chri&s;tian Religion flouri&s;h'd in its primitive Purity, from the Year 186, till the <HI>Pelagian</HI> Here&s;y over&s;pread this Country; which being afterwards rooted out, they plac'd St. <HI>Dobricius,</HI> as the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop, in this Town of <HI>Lan|daff,</HI> then call'd <HI>Launt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n:</HI> The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff</HI> had formerly the Title of Archbi&s;hop; the three fir&s;t Bi&s;hops were afterwards &s;ainted for their eminent Holine&s;s of Life, and the Miracles they are &s;aid to have wrought. 'Tis ob&s;ervable the Cathedral was antiently but 20 Foot long, and 10 broad, and had neither Steeple nor Bells, nor had they any other
<PB N="316" REF="325">
Cathedral from the Year 386, to the Year 1107, when Bi&s;hop <HI>Urban</HI> built the pre&s;ent Church, with &s;ome Hou&s;es for the Clergy adjoining, in the Nature of a Cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>Tho' the Church is antient, yet the Building is good, and the Choir neat, and pretty well kept.</P>
<P>The South Part of <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire</HI> is plea&s;ant, agreeable, and very populous, in&s;omuch that it is called <HI>The Garden of Wales.</HI> Its Soil is fertile and rich, and the low Grounds are &s;o well cover'd with Gra&s;s, and &s;tock'd with Cattle, that they &s;upply the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> with Butter in very great Quantities &s;alted and barrel'd up, ju&s;t as <HI>Suffolk</HI> does the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caerphyli-Ca&s;tle</HI> in <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire,</HI> is one of the noble&s;t Pieces of Ruins in the whole I&s;land. It was larger than any Ca&s;tle in <HI>England,</HI> that of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> excepted; and from what remains of it, was as beautiful in its Architecture, as it is remarkable in its Ruins.</P>
<P><HI>Neath</HI> is a Port where the Coal-Trade is pretty con&s;iderable, tho' it &s;tands up within Land.</P>
<P><HI>Swanzy</HI> is al&s;o a Sea-port, and a very con&s;iderable Town for Trade, with a very good Harbour: Here is al&s;o a very great Trade for Coals, and Culm, which they export to all the Ports of <HI>Somer&s;et, Devon,</HI> and <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and even to <HI>Ireland</HI>; &s;o that &s;ome|times may be &s;een a hundred Sail of Ships at a time loading Coals here; which greatly enriches the Coun|try, and particularly this Town; it &s;tands on the River <HI>Twye,</HI> or <HI>Taw:</HI> 'Tis very remarkable, that mo&s;t of the Rivers in this County chime upon the Letters <HI>T</HI> and <HI>Y,</HI> as <HI>Taaf, Tawy, Tuy, Towy, Tyevy.</HI></P>
<P>There are lately Mineral Waters found out at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> which are reported to be of great Efficacy in Fluxes and Haemorrhages of all Sorts. Con&s;umptions, if not too far gone, Diabetes, Pal&s;ies, Rheumati&s;ms,
<PB N="317" REF="326">
Drop&s;ies, and other Di&s;tempers, are &s;aid to fall before the&s;e Styptick and Re&s;torative Waters. They may certainly have very good Effects in many difficult Ca&s;es; but it is doing an Injury to the Reputation of any Medicine in the World, to make it a <HI>Catholicon,</HI> and good for every thing.</P>
<P><HI>Kynfig-Ca&s;tle,</HI> is now the Seat and E&s;tate of the Lord <HI>Man&s;el,</HI> who has here al&s;o a very noble Income from the Collieries; which formerly denominated Sir <HI>Edward Man&s;el,</HI> one of the riche&s;t Commoners in <HI>Wales.</HI> The Family was innobled by her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>In this Neighbourhood, near <HI>Margan Mynydd,</HI> we &s;aw the famous Monument mention'd by Mr. <HI>Cam|den,</HI> on a Hill, with the In&s;cription, which the Vul|gar are &s;o terrify'd at, that nobody cares to read it; for they have a Tradition from Father to Son, that whoever ventures to read it, will die within a Month. We did not &s;cruple the Adventure, but when we came to try, the Letters were &s;o defac'd by Time, that we were effectually &s;ecur'd from the Danger; the In&s;cription not being any thing near &s;o legible, as it &s;eems it was in Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>'s time.</P>
<P>The Stone Pillar is about 4 or 5 Feet high, and one Foot thick, &s;tanding on the Top of this Hill; there are &s;everal other &s;uch Monuments in <HI>Radnor|&s;hire,</HI> and other Counties in <HI>Wales,</HI> as likewi&s;e in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus touch'd on what is mo&s;t curious on this Coa&s;t, we pa&s;s'd thro' the Land of <HI>Gowre</HI>; and going &s;till <HI>We&s;t,</HI> we came to <HI>Caermarthen,</HI> or <HI>Kaer-Vyrdhin,</HI> as the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> call it, the Capital of the County of <HI>Kaermardhin&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>This is an antient and a very hand&s;ome Town, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the River <HI>Towy,</HI> which is navi|gable up to the Town, for Ve&s;&s;els of a moderate Burden, and over which is a large Bridge. The Town is well-built, and populous; it is lately much
<PB N="318" REF="327">
increas'd, and is &s;till increa&s;ing; and the County round it is the mo&s;t fruitful of any Part of <HI>Wales,</HI> and con|tinues to be &s;o thro' all the Middle of the County, and a great Way into the next; nor is this County &s;o mountainous and wild, as the re&s;t of this Part of <HI>Wales:</HI> But it abounds in Corn, and in fine flouri&s;h|ing Meadows, as good as mo&s;t are in <HI>Britain,</HI> and in which are fed a very great Number of good Cattle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chancery,</HI> and <HI>Exchequer,</HI> for the South Part of the Principality, were u&s;ually kept at this Town, till the Juri&s;diction of the Court and Marches of <HI>Wales</HI> was taken away. This Town was al&s;o fa|mous for the Birth of the old <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Prophet, <HI>Mer|lin,</HI> of whom &s;o many things are fabled, and who flouri&s;h'd in the Year 480: And here al&s;o the old <HI>Britons</HI> often kept their Parliaments, or A&s;&s;emblies of their wi&s;e Men, and made their Laws. The Town was fortify'd in former times, but the Walls are not to be &s;een now, and &s;carcely the Ruins of them. The People in this Town and Country are reckon'd the wealthie&s;t and polite&s;t in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Here we &s;aw near <HI>Kily-Maen Llwyd,</HI> on a great Mountain, a Circle of mighty Stones, very much like <HI>Stone-henge</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> or rather like the <HI>Roll-rich</HI> Stones in <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI>; and tho' the People call it <HI>Bruarth Arthur,</HI> or King <HI>Arthur's Throne,</HI> we &s;ee no rea&s;on to believe, that it had any relation to him.</P>
<P>The next County We&s;t, is <HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> the mo&s;t extreme Part of <HI>Wales</HI> on this Side. It is a rich, fertile, and plentiful Country, lying on the Sea-coa&s;t, where it has the Benefit of <HI>Milford-Haven,</HI> one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t Ports in <HI>Britain.</HI> Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays, it contains 16 Creeks, 5 great Bays, and 13 good Roads for Shipping, all di&s;tingui&s;h'd as &s;uch by their Names; and &s;ome &s;ay, a thou&s;and Sail of Ships may ride in it.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="328">Part of <HI>Pembroke&s;hire</HI> is inhabited by the De&s;cen|dants of the <HI>Flemings,</HI> placed there by King <HI>Henry</HI> I. and that County is called, <HI>Little England beyond Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Before we quitted the Coa&s;t, we &s;aw <HI>Tenbigk,</HI> the mo&s;t agreeable Town on all the Sea-coa&s;t of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> except <HI>Pembroke,</HI> being a very good Road for Shipping, and well frequented. Here is a great Fi&s;hery for Herring in its Sea&s;on, a great Colliery, or rather Export of Coals, and they al&s;o drive a very con&s;iderable Trade to <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, the Land, bearing far into the Sea, makes a Promontory, call'd St. <HI>Goven's-Head,</HI> or <HI>Point.</HI> But as we found nothing of Moment there, we cro&s;s'd over the I&s;thmus to <HI>Pembroke,</HI> which &s;tands on the Ea&s;t Shore of the great Haven of <HI>Milford.</HI></P>
<P>This is the large&s;t and riche&s;t, and at this Time the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Town of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> except <HI>Carmarthen.</HI> Here are a great many Gentlemen and Merchants, and &s;ome of the latter are Men of good Bu&s;ine&s;s; and they told us, there were near 200 Sail of Ships belong'd to the Town, &s;mall and great; in a Word, all this Part of <HI>Wales</HI> is a rich and flouri&s;hing Country, very plea&s;ant, fertile, and well cultivated.</P>
<P>This is the Place al&s;o made particularly famous for the Landing of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. then Earl of <HI>Richmond.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, being re&s;olv'd to &s;ee the utmo&s;t Ex|tent of the County, We&s;t, we ferry'd over the Haven, and went to <HI>Haverford,</HI> by &s;ome call'd <HI>Haverford-We&s;t,</HI> a County in it&s;elf; and from thence to St. <HI>David</HI>'s. <HI>Haverford</HI> is a good Town, &s;trong, well-built, clean, and populous.</P>
<P>From hence to St. <HI>David</HI>'s, the Country begins to look dry, barren, and mountainous.</P>
<P>St. <HI>David</HI>'s is now a Bi&s;hop's See only, but was formerly an Archbi&s;hop's, which was transferr'd to <HI>Dole</HI> in <HI>Britany,</HI> where it &s;till remains.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="329">The venerable A&s;pect of this Cathedral Church &s;hews, that it has been a beautiful Building. The We&s;t-end or Body of the Church is tolerable; the Choir is kept neat; the South I&s;le without the Choir, and the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>'s Chapel, which makes the Ea&s;t|end of the Church, are in a manner demoli&s;h'd, and the Roofs of both fallen in.</P>
<P>There have been a great many eminent Per&s;ons bury'd here, be&s;ides &s;uch who&s;e Monuments are de|fac'd by Time. Here is St. <HI>David</HI>'s Monument, to whom the Church is dedicated, the Monument of the Earl of <HI>Richmond,</HI> as al&s;o of the famous <HI>Owen Tudor</HI>; Here are al&s;o four antient Monuments of Knights-Templars, known by their Figures lying cro&s;s-legg'd; but their Names are not known, and there are &s;ix &s;everal Monuments of Bi&s;hops, who pre&s;ided over this Church, be&s;ides St. <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>This Saint, they tell us, was Uncle to King <HI>Ar|thur,</HI> that he lived to 146 Years of Age, that he was Bi&s;hop of this Church &s;ixty-five Years, being born in the Year 496, and died <HI>Anno</HI> 642; that he built twelve Mona&s;teries, and perform'd abundance of Mi|racles.</P>
<P>There was a very hand&s;ome Hou&s;e for the Bi&s;hop, with a College, all built in a Clo&s;e by them&s;elves; but they are now in Ruins.</P>
<P>Here, the Weather being very clear, we had a full View of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though at a very great Di&s;tance. The Land here is call'd St. <HI>David's-Head.</HI> They reckon up 114 Bi&s;hops of this See, &s;ince it began, to the Year 1740.</P>
<P>A late Bi&s;hop of this See was Dr. <HI>Thomas Wat|&s;on,</HI> of whom the World has heard &s;o much, being depriv'd, after a long Debate, on a Charge of <HI>Simony.</HI> I &s;hall not inquire into the Merits of the Ca&s;e; but he be&s;tow'd great Sums on charitable De&s;igns.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd North, keeping the Sea in our We&s;t Pro&s;pect, and a rugged mountainous Coun|try

on the Ea&s;t, where the Hills even darken'd the Air with their Height. As we went on, we pa&s;t by <HI>Newport,</HI> on the River <HI>Nevern,</HI> a Town having a good Harbour, and con&s;equently a good Trade with <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Here we left <HI>Pembroke&s;hire,</HI> and after about 22 Miles came to <HI>Cardigan,</HI> a well-inhabited Town, on the River <HI>Tyvy,</HI> over which it has a fair Stone Bridge: 'Tis a very noble River indeed, and famous for its Plenty of the be&s;t and large&s;t Salmon in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Country People told us, that they had for|merly Beavers here, which bred in the Lakes among the Mountains, and coming down the Stream of <HI>Tyvy,</HI> de&s;troy'd the young Frye of Salmon, and therefore the Country People de&s;troy'd 'em. We thought they only meant the Otter, till I found afterwards, that Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> mentions al&s;o, that there had been Bea|vers &s;een here formerly.</P>
<P>This Town of <HI>Cardigan</HI> was once po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the great <HI>Robert Fitz-Stephen,</HI> who was the fir&s;t <HI>Briton</HI> that ever attempted the Conque&s;t of <HI>Ireland</HI>; and had &s;uch Succe&s;s with a Handful of Men, as after|wards gave the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> a Footing there, which they never quitted afterwards, till they quite reduc'd the Country, and made it, as it were, a Province to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Town is large and populous, has a fair Church, and is walled about, and fortified with a Ca&s;tle, but that Part is now not much minded. It has a good Trade with <HI>Ireland,</HI> and is enrich'd very much, as is all this Part of the Country, by the famous Lead Mines, formerly di&s;cover'd by Sir <HI>Carbery Price,</HI> which are the greate&s;t, and perhaps the riche&s;t in <HI>England</HI>; and particularly as they require &s;o little Labour and Charge to come at the Ore, which in many Places lies within a Fathom or two of the Surface, and in &s;ome, even bare to the very Top. There are al&s;o Silver Mines in this County.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="331">Going North from the <HI>Tyvy</HI> about 25 Miles, we came to <HI>Abery&s;twith,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Town at the Mouth of the River <HI>Y&s;twith.</HI> It is a populous, but a dark, &s;moaky Place; and we fan&s;y'd the Peo|ple look'd as if they had liv'd continually in Coal or Lead Mines. However, they are rich.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Cardigan</HI> is in no wi&s;e comparable to either of tho&s;e <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Counties which we have already pa&s;s'd through, there being a great deal of bar|ren Lands in it. However, it is &s;o full of Cattle, that 'tis &s;aid to be the Nur&s;ery, or Breeding-Place for the whole Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> South by <HI>Trent</HI>; but this is not a Proof of its Fertility; for tho' the feeding of Cattle indeed requires a rich Soil, the breeding them does not, the Mountains and Moors being as proper for that Purpo&s;e as richer Land.</P>
<P>Now we enter'd <HI>North-Wales</HI>; only I &s;hould add, that as we pa&s;s'd, we had a Sight of the famous <HI>Plymlymon-Hill,</HI> out of the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of which, ri&s;e the <HI>Severn,</HI> and the <HI>Wye</HI>; and out of the We&s;t-&s;ide of it, ri&s;e the <HI>Rydall</HI> and the <HI>Y&s;twyth.</HI> This Moun|tain is exceeding high, and though it is hard to &s;ay which is the highe&s;t Hill in <HI>Wales,</HI> yet I think this bids fair for it; nor is the County, for 20 Miles round it, any thing but a continued Ridge of Mountains: So that for a few Days we &s;eem'd to be conver&s;ing in the upper Regions; for we were often above the Clouds a great way, and the Names of &s;ome of the&s;e Hills &s;eem'd as barbarous to us, who &s;poke no <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> as the Hills them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e Mountains North, we enter'd North <HI>Wales,</HI> which contains the Counties of <HI>Montgomery, Merioneth, Caernarvon, Denbeigh,</HI> and <HI>Flint</HI> Shires, and the I&s;le of <HI>Angle&s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing <HI>Montgomery&s;hire,</HI> we were &s;o tired with Hills and Mountains, that we wi&s;h'd heartily we had kept clo&s;e to the Sea Shore; but we had not much mended the matter, if we had, as I under&s;tood
<PB N="323" REF="332">
afterwards. The River <HI>Severn</HI> is the principal Beauty of this County, which ri&s;ing out of the <HI>Plymlymon</HI> Mountain, as I have &s;aid, receives in a &s;hort Cour&s;e &s;o many other Rivers into its Bo&s;om, that it becomes navigable before it gets out of the County, at <HI>Wel&s;h-Pool,</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Shrop&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Montgomery</HI> is a fa&s;hionable Place, and has many fair Dwellings in it, and &s;ome very good Families.</P>
<P>The Vales and Meadows upon the Banks of the <HI>Severn</HI> are exceedingly ornamental and profitable, and 'tis &s;aid, that the Water of the <HI>Severn,</HI> like that of <HI>Nile,</HI> when it overflows, impregnates the Valleys by the Slime it leaves behind it; all the Country is very fruitful, where-ever this River runs. The Town of <HI>Montgomery</HI> lies not far from this River, on the outer Edge of the County, next to <HI>Hereford&s;hire.</HI> This was, it &s;eems, a great Frontier Town in the Wars between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> and was beautify'd and fortify'd by King <HI>Henry</HI> III. but it is not now &s;o very con&s;iderable, though a good Town &s;till, plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and has a Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This County has been long noted for an excellent Breed of <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Hor&s;es, which, though not very large, are exceeding valuable, and much e&s;teem'd all over <HI>England.</HI> All the North and We&s;t Part of the County is mountainous and &s;tony. We &s;aw a great many old Monuments in this Country, and <HI>Roman</HI> Camps, where-ever we came; and e&s;pecially, if we met any Per&s;ons curious in &s;uch things, we found they had many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins.</P>
<P><HI>Merioneth&s;hire,</HI> or <HI>Merionyd&s;hire,</HI> lies We&s;t from <HI>Montgomery&s;hire,</HI> on the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea, or rather the Ocean; for St. <HI>George's Chanel</HI> does not begin till further North; and it is extended on the Coa&s;t, for near 35 Miles in Length, all &s;till mountainous and craggy. The principal River is the <HI>Tovy,</HI> which ri&s;es among the unpa&s;&s;able Mountains, which range
<PB N="324" REF="333">
along the Centre of this Part of <HI>Wales,</HI> and which we look at with A&s;toni&s;hment, for their prodigious Height. Some of the Hills have particular Names, but otherwi&s;e we called them all, <HI>The Black Moun|tains,</HI> and they well de&s;erve the Name. Some think 'tis from the unpa&s;&s;able Mountains of this County, that we have an old Saying, That the Devil lives in the <HI>Middle of Wales,</HI> tho' I know there is another Meaning given to it; in a word, Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls the&s;e Parts the <HI>Alps of Wales.</HI></P>
<P>There are but few large Towns in all this Part, nor is it very populous; much of it being &s;carce habitable, but 'tis &s;aid, there are more Sheep in it, than in all the re&s;t of <HI>Wales.</HI> On the Sea Shore however, we &s;aw <HI>Harleigh,</HI> or <HI>Harlech-Ca&s;tle,</HI> which is &s;till a Gari&s;on, and kept for the Guard of the Coa&s;t; but 'tis of no other Strength, than what its Situation gives it.</P>
<P>In the middle of the&s;e va&s;t Mountains (and form|ing a very large Lake, <HI>viz.</HI> near its fir&s;t Sources) ri&s;es the River <HI>Dee,</HI> of which I &s;hall &s;peak again in its proper Place.</P>
<P>Here, among almo&s;t innumerable Summits, and ri&s;ing Peaks of namele&s;s Hills, we &s;aw the famous <HI>Kader-Idricks,</HI> which, &s;ome are of Opinion, is the highe&s;t Mountain in <HI>Britain,</HI> another call'd <HI>Rarau|vaur,</HI> another call'd <HI>Mowywynda</HI>; and &s;till every Hill we &s;aw, we thought higher than all that ever we &s;aw before.</P>
<P>We inquired here after that &s;trange Phaenomenon, which was not only &s;een, but fatally experienc'd, by the Country round this Place, namely of a livid Fire, coming off from the Sea, and &s;etting on Fire Hou&s;es, Barns, Stacks of Hay and Corn, and poi&s;oning the Herbage in the Field; of which there is a full Account given in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;|actions: And as we had it confirm'd by the general Voice of the People, I &s;hall take notice, That the
<PB N="325" REF="334">
Tran&s;actions particularly ob&s;erve, that the Eclip&s;es of the Sun in <HI>Aries</HI> have been very fatal to this Place; and that the Years 1542, and 1567, when the Sun was eclip&s;ed in that Sign, it &s;uffer'd very much by Fire; and after the latter Eclip&s;e of the two, the Fire &s;pread &s;o far, that about 200 Hou&s;es in the Town and Suburbs of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> were con|&s;um'd.</P>
<P>This mountainous Country runs away North thro' <HI>Merioneth&s;hire,</HI> and almo&s;t thro' <HI>Caernarvon&s;hire,</HI> where <HI>Snowden-hill,</HI> of a mon&s;trous Height, accord|ing to its Name, had Snow on the Top in the Be|ginning of <HI>June</HI>; but it does not continue the Year round, as &s;ome have a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>The&s;e unpa&s;&s;able Heights were doubtle&s;s the Re|fuges of the <HI>Britons,</HI> when, in their continual Wars with the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> they were over|power'd.</P>
<P>That Side of the County of <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> which borders on the Sea, is not &s;o mountainous, and is both more fertile, and more populous. The prin|cipal Place in this Part is <HI>Caernarvon,</HI> a good Town, with a Ca&s;tle built by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to curb and re|duce the wild People of the Mountains, and &s;ecure the Pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Angle&s;ea.</HI> That Prince al&s;o kept his Court often here; and here his elde&s;t Son and Succe&s;&s;or, <HI>Edward</HI> II. was born, who was there|fore call'd <HI>Edward of Caernarvon.</HI> This <HI>Edward</HI> was the fir&s;t of the Sons of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> ve&s;ted with the Title of Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> And here were kept the <HI>Chancery</HI> and <HI>Exchequer</HI> of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> for the North Part of the Prin|cipality, as it was at <HI>Caermarthen</HI> for the South Part. It is a &s;mall, but &s;trong Town, clean, and well-built; and, con&s;idering the Place, the People are very cour|teous and obliging to Strangers. It is &s;eated on the Firth or Inlet call'd <HI>Meneu,</HI> parting the I&s;le of <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> or <HI>Mona,</HI> from the main Land; and here

<P>Whoever travels critically over the&s;e Mountains of <HI>South-Wales</HI> and <HI>Merioneth&s;hire,</HI> will think <HI>Stone|henge</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Roll-rich</HI> Stones in <HI>Oxfora|&s;hire,</HI> no more Wonders, &s;eeing there are &s;o many &s;uch in the&s;e Provinces, that they are not thought &s;trange of at all, nor is it doubted, but they were generally Monuments of the Dead; as al&s;o are the &s;ingle Stones of immen&s;e Bulk, of which we &s;aw &s;o many, that we gave over remarking 'em. Some mea&s;ur'd from 7, 8, to 10, and one 16 Feet high, being a whole Stone, but &s;o great, that the mo&s;t of the Wonder is, where they were found, and how dragg'd to the Place; &s;ince, be&s;ides the &s;teep A&s;cents to &s;ome of the Hills, on which they &s;tand, it would be hardly po&s;&s;ible to move &s;ome of them, now, with 50 Yoke of Oxen. And yet a great many of the&s;e Stones are found confu&s;edly lying one upon another on the utmo&s;t Summit or Top of the <HI>Gly|der,</HI> and other Hills in <HI>Merioneth,</HI> or <HI>Caernarvon|&s;hire</HI>; to which it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, that all the Power of Art, and Strength of Man and Bea&s;t, could carry them, and the Vulgar make no Difficulty of &s;aying, The Devil &s;et them up there.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e monumental Stones is to be &s;een a little way from <HI>Harleigh-Ca&s;tle:</HI> It is a large Stone lying flat, &s;upported by three other Stones at three of the four Angles, tho' the Stone is rather oval than &s;quare; it is almo&s;t 11 Feet long, the Breadth un|equal; but in &s;ome Places it is from 7 to 8 Feet broad, and it may be &s;uppo&s;ed has been both longer and broader; 'tis in &s;ome Places about two Feet thick, but in others, 'tis worn almo&s;t to an Edge by Time. The three Stones that &s;upport it, are about
<PB N="327" REF="340">
20 Inches &s;quare; 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed there have been four, two of which, that &s;upport the thicke&s;t End, are near 8 Feet high, the other not above three Feet, being &s;uppos'd to be &s;ettled in the Ground, &s;o that the Stone lies &s;loping, like the Roof of a Barn. There is another of the&s;e to be &s;een in the I&s;le of <HI>Angle&s;ea</HI>; the flat Stone is much larger and thicker than this; but we did not go to &s;ee it. There are al&s;o two Circles of Stones in that I&s;land, &s;uch as <HI>Stone-henge,</HI> but larger.</P>
<P>This is a particular kind of Monument, and there|fore I took Notice of it; but the others are generally &s;ingle Stones of va&s;t Magnitude, &s;et up on one End, Column-wi&s;e, which being &s;o very large, are likely to remain till the End of Time: but are generally without any In&s;cription, or regular Shape, or any Mark, to intimate for whom, or for what, they were &s;o placed.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mountains are indeed &s;o like the <HI>Alps,</HI> that except the Language of the People, one could hardly avoid thinking he is pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Grenoble</HI> to <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> or rather thro' the Country of the <HI>Gri&s;ons.</HI> The Lakes al&s;o, which are &s;o numerous here, make the Similitude the greater: nor are the Fables which the Country People tell of the&s;e Lakes, much unlike the Stories which we meet with among the <HI>Switz|ers,</HI> of the famous Lakes in their Country. Mr. <HI>Camden</HI>'s Continuator tells us of 50 or 60 Lakes in <HI>Caernarvon&s;hire</HI> only. We did not count 'em, but I believe, if we had, we &s;hould have found them to be more, rather than le&s;s.</P>
<P>Here we met with the Char Fi&s;h, the &s;ame kind which we &s;aw in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and al&s;o in the Lakes of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and no-where el&s;e, that I have heard of, in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> call it the <HI>Torg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ch.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing of Note to be &s;een in the I&s;le of <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> but the Town and the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Beau|maris,</HI> which was al&s;o built by King <HI>Edward</HI> I.
<PB N="328" REF="341">
and call'd <HI>Beau-mar&s;h,</HI> or the <HI>Fine Plain</HI>; for here the Country is very level and plain, and the Land is fruitful and plea&s;ant. The Ca&s;tle was very large, as may be &s;een by its Remains; and that it was &s;trong, the Situation will tell al&s;o; but 'tis now of no U&s;e.</P>
<P>As we went to <HI>Holyhead,</HI> by the South Part of the I&s;land from <HI>Newborough,</HI> and came back thro' the Middle to <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> we &s;aw the whole Extent of it; and indeed, it is a much plea&s;anter Country than any Part of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> that we had yet &s;een; and particularly is very fruitful in Corn and Cattle.</P>
<P>Here we cro&s;s'd the <HI>Streight</HI> of <HI>Meneu</HI> again, and came to <HI>Bangor,</HI> at the Place where King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> I. intended to have built a great Stone-bridge: It would indeed have been a Work fit for &s;o great a King: But the Bottom being doubtful, and the Sea in that Place &s;ometimes very raging and &s;trong, the Workmen thought it impracticable; and though the King was very po&s;itive in his De&s;ign for a great while, yet he was prevail'd with at la&s;t to decline it.</P>
<P><HI>Bangor</HI> is a Town noted for its Antiquity. It is a Bi&s;hop's See, but has an old, mean-looking, and almo&s;t de&s;picable Cathedral Church.</P>
<P>This Church boa&s;ts of being one of the mo&s;t antient in <HI>Britain,</HI> the People &s;ay, the mo&s;t antient; and that St. <HI>Daniel</HI> (to whom it was dedicated) was fir&s;t Bi&s;hop here, in the Year 512. They allow that the Pagans, perhaps of <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> ruin'd the Church, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Bi&s;hoprick after it was built, for above one hundred Years; nor is there any Ac|count of it from the Year 512 to 1009: After this, the Bi&s;hoprick was ruin'd again by one of its own Bi&s;hops, who&s;e Name was <HI>Bulkeley,</HI> who, as the <HI>Mona&s;ticon</HI> &s;ays, not only &s;old the Revenues, but even the very Bells; for which Sacrilege it is &s;aid he was &s;truck blind.</P>
<P>It is certainly at pre&s;ent no rich Bi&s;hoprick; yet the Bi&s;hops are generally allow'd to hold &s;ome other
<PB N="329" REF="342">
good Benefice <HI>in Commendam,</HI> and the Preferment &s;eems to be a grateful Introduction to the Clergy, as the Bi&s;hops are generally tran&s;lated from hence to a more profitable one; and very few Gentlemen of the Function have dy'd Bi&s;hops of <HI>Bangor</HI>; &s;o that, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, a Bi&s;hop of this See may be &s;aid to be immortal.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bangor</HI> we went North, (keeping the Sea on our Left-hand) to <HI>Conway.</HI> This is the poore&s;t, but plea&s;ante&s;t Town in all this County for the Big|ne&s;s of it; it is &s;eated on the Bank of a fine River, which is not only plea&s;ant and beautiful, but is a noble Harbour for Ships, had they any Occa&s;ion for them there; the Stream is deep and &s;afe, and the River broad, as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Deptford:</HI> It only wants a Trade &s;uitable to &s;o good a Port; for it in|finitely outdoes <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Liverpool</HI> too.</P>
<P>In this Pa&s;&s;age, we went over the famous Preci|pice call'd <HI>Penmaen-maur,</HI> which I think Fame has made abundance more frightful than it is; for tho' the Rock is indeed very high, and, if any one &s;hould fall from it, he would be da&s;h'd in Pieces, yet, on the other hand, there is no Danger of it, a Wall being built all the Way, on the Edge of the Preci|pice, to &s;ecure Pa&s;&s;engers: Tho&s;e who have been at the Hill or Pa&s;s of <HI>Enterkin</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> know very well, the Danger there is much greater than here; and the frequent Lo&s;s of Lives, both of Man and Hor&s;e, will te&s;tify the &s;ame.</P>
<P>We have but little remarkable in the Road from <HI>Conway</HI> to <HI>Holywell,</HI> but Craggs and Rocks all along the North Shore of <HI>Denbeigh,</HI> till we came to <HI>Den|beigh</HI> the County Town, which has a Ca&s;tle of great Strength; it is a large, populous Place, and has a good Trade carry'd on by Tanners and Glovers. This Town carries &s;omething in its Countenance of its Neighbourhood to <HI>England</HI>; but that which was mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, after &s;uch a tire&s;ome and fatiguing

Journey, over the inho&s;pitable Mountains of <HI>Me|rioneth</HI> and <HI>Caernarvon&s;hire,</HI> was, that de&s;cending now from the Hills, we came into a mo&s;t plea|&s;ant, fruitful, populous, and delicious Vale, full o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Villages and Towns, the Fields &s;hining with Corn&punc; ju&s;t ready for the Reapers, the Meadows green and flowery, and a fine River, of a mild and gentle Stream, running thro' it: Nor is it a &s;mall or ca&s;ua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Intermi&s;&s;ion, but we had a Pro&s;pect of the Country open before us for above 20 Miles in Length, and from 5 to 7 Miles in Breadth, all &s;miling with the &s;ame kind of Complexion; which made us think our|&s;elves in <HI>England</HI> again, all on a &s;udden.</P>
<P>In this plea&s;ant Vale, turning North from <HI>Den|beigh,</HI> and following the Stream of the River, we came to <HI>St. A&s;aph,</HI> in <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> a &s;mall City, with a Cathedral, being a Bi&s;hoprick of tolerable good Value, though the Church is old: It is but a poor Place, and ill-built, although the Country is &s;o plea|&s;ant and rich all round it. There are &s;ome old Mo|numents in this Church, but none of any Note, nor could we read the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> In&s;criptions.</P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>Holywell:</HI> The Story of it is, that the pious Virgin, St. <HI>Winifred,</HI> being ravi&s;h'd and murder'd, this healing Water &s;prung out of her Body when buried. The <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> be|lieve it, as 'tis evident, from their thronging hither to receive Benefit from the healing Virtue of the Water, which they do not hope for as medicinal, but as miraculous, and think it heals them by vir|tue of the Interce&s;&s;ion and Influence of this famous Virgin, St. <HI>Winifrid.</HI></P>
<P>The Chapel dedicated to this Holy Virgin, is cut out of a &s;olid Rock, and Numbers of Pilgrims re|&s;ort to it, with great Devotion. Under this Chapel, the Water gu&s;hes out into a great Stream, and the Place where it breaks out, is form'd like a Ba&s;in or Ci&s;tern, in which they bathe: The Water is inten&s;ly

<P>There is a little Town near the Well, which may, indeed, be &s;aid to have ri&s;en from the Con|fluence of People thither; for almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es are either Publick Hou&s;es, or let into Lodgings; and the Prie&s;ts who attend here, and are very numerous, appear in Di&s;gui&s;e: Sometimes they are Phy&s;icians, &s;ometimes Surgeons, &s;ometimes Gentlemen, and &s;ometimes Patients, or any thing, as Occa&s;ion pre|&s;ents. Nobody takes notice of them, as to their Religion, though they are well known, no not the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> them&s;elves; but in private they have their proper Oratories in certain Places, whi|ther the Votaries re&s;ort; and good Manners has pre|vail'd &s;o far, that no Prote&s;tant, let him know what he will, takes Notice of it, or inquires where one goes, or has been gone.</P>
<P>The principal Towns in <HI>Flint&s;hire,</HI> are, 1. <HI>Flint,</HI> the Shire Town, but &s;o &s;mall, that it has not a Market. 2. <HI>St. A&s;aph,</HI> before-mention'd. 3. <HI>Caer|wys,</HI> the chief Market-Town of the County.</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;s'd by <HI>Flint-Ca&s;tle,</HI> a known Place, but of no Con&s;equence now; and directly to <HI>Wrexham,</HI> deemed the large&s;t Town in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> having heard much of a fine Church there, but we were greatly di&s;appointed: There is indeed a very large Tower or Steeple, as &s;ome call it, adorn'd with Imagery; but far from fine: The Work is mean, the Statues without any Fancy or Spirit; and as the Stone is of a reddi&s;h crumbling Kind, like the Cathe|dral at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> Time has made it look gro&s;s and rough.</P>
<P>There are a great many antient Monuments in this Church, and in the Church-yard al&s;o; but none of
<PB N="332" REF="345">
Note, and almo&s;t all the In&s;criptions are in <HI>Wel&s;h.</HI> The Church is large; but they mu&s;t be much mi&s;|taken, who tell us 'tis one of the fine&s;t in <HI>England</HI>; for it falls &s;hort in that re&s;pect, of even tho&s;e Churches which are as old as it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This Town is large, well-built and populous; and be&s;ides the Church, there are two large Meeting-Hou&s;es, in one of which, we were told they preach in <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> one Part of the Day, and in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the other. Here is a great Market for Flannel, which the Factors buy up of the poor <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> People, who manufacture it; and thence it is &s;ent to <HI>London</HI>; and is a con&s;iderable Manufacture thro' all this Part of the Country, by which the Poor are very pro|fitably imploy'd.</P>
<P>We could not omit &s;eeing the once famous <HI>Ban|chor,</HI> which <HI>Malmsbury</HI> confounds with the Epi&s;copal <HI>Bangor</HI>; and were pleas'd to &s;ee there a fine Stone Bridge over the <HI>Dee.</HI> This was once a City, and the Mona&s;tery was &s;o famous, that in the Time of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings it was &s;aid to contain 2400 Monks, who in their Turns (<HI>viz.</HI> 100 each Hour of the 24) reading Prayers and &s;inging P&s;alms continually, Divine Service was perform'd Day and Night without In|termi&s;&s;ion. But now not &s;o much as the Ruins are to be &s;een, and as all the People in the little Vil|lage, that takes place of it, &s;poke <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> we could find no body that could give us any Intelligence. So effectually had Time eras'd the very Foundations of the Place.</P>
<P>This is &s;aid to be the Birth-place of that Arch-here|tick <HI>Pelagius,</HI> who from hence began to broach his heretical Opinions, which afterwards &s;o terribly over|&s;pread the Church. <HI>Camden</HI> ob&s;erves, that this <HI>Ban|gor</HI> is &s;ituated in the County of <HI>Flint.</HI></P>
<P>But before I have intirely done with the Princi|pality, give me leave to ob&s;erve briefly a few things with relation to this Journey, and the Gentlemen of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="346">Tho' this Journey, and e&s;pecially over &s;uch mon|&s;trous Hills and Precipices, as tho&s;e in <HI>Merioneth</HI> and &s;ome other Shires, was a little heavy to us, yet were we well &s;upported through it, for we generally found their Provi&s;ions very good and cheap, and pretty good Accommodations in the Inns.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Gentlemen are very ho&s;pitable; and the People in general very obliging and conver&s;able, e&s;pecially to Strangers. When we let them know, we travell'd merely in Curio&s;ity to view the Country, their Civility was heightened to &s;uch a Degree, that nothing could be more friendly, and they were will|ing to tell us every thing that belong'd to their Coun|try, and to &s;hew us all that we de&s;ir'd to &s;ee.</P>
<P>They value them&s;elves much upon their antient Heroes, as <HI>Caractacus, Owen ap Tudor,</HI> Prince <HI>Lewellin</HI>; and particularly upon the Antiquity of their Families, and laugh at a Pedigree, that can't be trac'd higher than the Conque&s;t. It mu&s;t be own'd, that the Gentlemen, ju&s;tly claim a very antient De&s;cent, and have pre&s;erv'd their Families intire, for many Ages: They receive you well into their Hou&s;es, treat you very hand&s;omely, are very gene|rous; and indeed, nothing is wanting within Doors; and, what is more, they have generally very good E&s;tates to &s;upport their Ho&s;pitality; but they are very jealous of Affronts, and &s;oon provok'd to An|ger, which is &s;eldom allay'd without Satisfaction; and then become as &s;oon reconcil'd again.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. CONTAINING A De&s;cription of Part of <HI>Che&s;hire, North|ampton&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Continued at <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> for &s;ome time, except that I made two or three Ex|cur&s;ions into the neighbouring Country, and particularly into that Part of <HI>Shrop|&s;hire</HI> which I had not view'd as I went; as al&s;o into the North, and North-we&s;t Parts of <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> But I &s;hould fir&s;t acquaint you, that <HI>Malpas,</HI> through which I came from <HI>Wales,</HI> is &s;ituate on a high Hill, and was formerly &s;trengthened by a Ca&s;tle, which is now in Ruins. The Church is a &s;tately Building, and &s;tands on the mo&s;t eminent Part of the Town: It has 2 Rectors, who do Duty alternately. The Town con&s;i&s;ts of 3 Streets, and is well pav'd; has a good Market, a Grammar-School, and an Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Trip I made, was into the <HI>Ce&s;tria Cher|&s;one&s;us,</HI> as I think we may properly call it: It is bounded by the two great Firths, or Arms of the Sea,
<PB N="335" REF="348">
the one call'd the Mouth of the <HI>Dee,</HI> and the other of the two Rivers <HI>Mer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Weaver,</HI> which form it into a Penin&s;ula. It is about 16 Miles long, 6 or 7 over, and has not one Market Town in it, tho' it is exceeding rich and fertile; occa&s;ion'd po&s;&s;ibly by the Neighbourhood of two &s;uch great Towns, as <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Liverpool.</HI></P>
<P>Going down from <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> by the <HI>Rhoodee,</HI> as they call it, that is, the Mar&s;hes of the River <HI>Dee,</HI> and coa&s;ting the River after it is grown broader than the Mar&s;hes, the fir&s;t Place of any Note which we come to, is <HI>Ne&s;&s;on,</HI> where, in the late <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> War, mo&s;t of the Troops embark'd for that grand Ex|pedition: From hence the Ve&s;&s;els go away to <HI>High-lake,</HI> where they ride &s;afe in their Way, as the Ships from <HI>London</HI> lie in the <HI>Downs,</HI> till the Wind pre|&s;ents for their re&s;pective Voyages.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> It is a fine old City and Colony of the <HI>Romans</HI>; and many Antiquities have been found in it. It has four Churches be&s;ide the Cathedral, which is a Pile venerable for Antiquity, but in no extraordinary Condition. There are Sha|dows of many Pictures on the Wall, but defac'd. At the We&s;t End, in Niches are &s;ome Images of the Earls Palatine of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> The adjoining Abbey is quite ruin'd. The Walls round the City are kept in very good Repair, at the Charge of the Corpo|ration, and afford a plea&s;ant, airy Walk. The Ex|change is a neat Building, &s;upported by Columns 13 Feet high, of one Stone each. Over it is the City-hall, a well-contrived Court of Judicature. The Ca&s;tle was formerly the Palace, where the Earls a&s;&s;embled their Parliaments, and enacted Laws inde|pendent of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> determining all Cau&s;es them&s;elves. It has always a Garri&s;on kept in it. The Piazza's or Rows, as they call them, do not in my Opinion, add any thing to the Beauty of the City; but, on the contrary, &s;erve to make it look
<PB N="336" REF="349">
both old and indifferent. The&s;e <HI>Rows</HI> are certain long Galleries, up one Pair of Stairs, which run along the Side of the Streets, before all the Hou&s;es, tho' joined to them, and, as is pretended, they are to keep the People dry in walking along. This they do indeed effectually, but then they take away all the View of the Hou&s;es from the Street, nor can a Stranger, that was to ride thro' <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> &s;ee any Shops in the City; be&s;ides, they make the Shops them&s;elves dark, and the Way in them is dark, dirty, and un|even.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Ornament of the City is, that the Streets are very broad and fair, and run thro' the whole City in &s;trait Lines, cro&s;&s;ing in the middle of it as at <HI>Chiche&s;ter:</HI> The Walls afford a very plea&s;ant Walk, as I have &s;aid, round the City, and within the Battlements, from whence you may &s;ee the cir|cumjacent Country, and particularly on the Side of the <HI>Rhoodee,</HI> which is a fine large low Green, on the Bank of the <HI>Dee,</HI> which in Winter is often under Water by the Inundations of the River. Be|yond the <HI>Rhoodee,</HI> may be &s;een from the Walls of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> the County of <HI>Flint,</HI> and the Mountains of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle is a good firm Building, and &s;trong, tho' not fortify'd with many Outworks: There is always a good Garri&s;on kept in it. 'Tis &s;aid this Ca&s;tle was built, or at lea&s;t repair'd, by <HI>Hugh Lupus,</HI> the famous Earl of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> Nephew to <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, as was al&s;o the Church; the Body of whom was lately (<HI>Anno</HI> 1723) di&s;cover'd, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, in an old ruinous Building called, The Chapter-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It was fir&s;t wrapp'd in Leather, and then inclos'd in a Stone Coffin. The Skull and all the Bones were very fre&s;h, and in their proper Po&s;ition; and, what is more remarkable, the String which ty'd the Ankles together, was whole and intire, altho' it was then upwards of 650 Years &s;ince the Interrment.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="350"><HI>Che&s;ter</HI> is but a modern Bi&s;hoprick, being &s;o made in the Year 1541. when King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. di|vided it from <HI>Lichfield.</HI> They tell us, that King <HI>Edgar,</HI> who conquer'd all this Part of <HI>Britain,</HI> and was rowed up the <HI>Dee</HI> in his Royal Barge by Seven, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, Eight Kings, him&s;elf &s;teering the Helm, founded the great Church, which <HI>Lupus</HI> fini&s;h'd and endow'd.</P>
<P>Here is a noble Stone Bridge over the <HI>Dee,</HI> very high and &s;trong built, and 'tis needful it &s;hould be &s;o; for the <HI>Dee</HI> is a mo&s;t furious Stream at &s;ome Sea&s;ons, and brings a va&s;t Weight of Water with it from the Mountains of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Che&s;ter</HI> has long given Title of Earl to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> elde&s;t Son of the King.</P>
<P><HI>Che&s;ter</HI> was formerly an Harbour for Shipping; but the Sea had long ago withdrawn it&s;elf; and the River <HI>Dee</HI> was &s;o choaked up, that Ve&s;&s;els of Bur|den could not come within &s;ome Miles of it; &s;o that an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the Year 1732, for rendering it navigable. And in Pur&s;uance thereof, the Undertakers, rai&s;ed a Sum of 47,830<HI>l.</HI> which they have expended in cutting and perfecting a new Chanel for the River <HI>Dee,</HI> of near Ten Miles in Length, and in making proper Dams and Sluices, into which they have turned the &s;aid River; &s;o that it is actually navigable at this Time for Ships and Ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable Burdens to the Quay, or Key, of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> where they load and unload Goods and Merchandize. This Succe&s;s encourag'd the Un|dertakers to apply to Parliament (1740-1), for further Powers to complete the &s;ame, and for uniting the &s;aid Undertakers into a Company for that laud|able Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This County, though &s;o remote from <HI>London,</HI> is one of tho&s;e which contributes much to its Support, as well as to that of &s;everal other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> by its excellent Chee&s;e, which they make here in
<PB N="338" REF="351">
&s;uch Quantities, that, as I am told from very good Authority, the City of <HI>London</HI> only takes off 14000 Tons every Year; be&s;ides va&s;t Quantities which they &s;end to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> and al&s;o to <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; &s;o that the Quantity of Chee&s;e made here, mu&s;t be prodigiou&s;ly great. Indeed, the whole County is imploy'd in it, and Part of its Neigh|bourhood too; for though it goes by the Name of <HI>Che&s;hire Chee&s;e,</HI> yet great Quantities of it are made in &s;uch Parts of <HI>Shrop&s;hire, Stafford&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Lan|ca&s;hire,</HI> as border upon <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The Soil is extraordinarily good, and the Gra&s;s has a peculiar Richne&s;s in it, which di&s;po&s;es the Kine to give a great Quantity of Milk, which is very &s;weet and good; and this Chee&s;e Manufacture increa&s;es every Day, rai&s;es the Value of the Lands, and en|courages the Farmers to keep va&s;t Stocks of Cows; which of them&s;elves contribute to improve and en|rich the Land.</P>
<P>While we were &s;tation'd, as I may &s;ay, at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> I made a Trip to &s;everal Places round about it. And particularly to the fine old Seat of the Lord <HI>Dela|mere,</HI> and the &s;pacious Fore&s;t which gives Title to that noble Family. They &s;ay here was formerly an old City, now called the <HI>Chamber on the Fore&s;t,</HI> pro|bably &s;ome Fort or Camp to &s;ecure the Road. From hence is &s;o fine a Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Mountains, that I never before beheld &s;uch a noble Scene of Nature. <HI>Bee&s;ton-Ca&s;tle</HI> is on our left, built upon a Precipice. This Fore&s;t is noted for great Plenty of Red and Fallow Deer, and is a great Relief for Fi&s;h, Fowl, and Turf, to the neighbouring Towns, whereof there are a great many &s;mall ones about this Fore&s;t, and thro' the upper Part of it the <HI>Weaver</HI> takes its Cour&s;e. The chief Town hereabout is <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">de&s;ham,</HI> famous formerly for a Ca&s;tle, and the Seat of the Family of the <HI>Savages,</HI> which however is but a mean Market-town. Near this Place is al&s;o
<PB N="339" REF="352">
the famous Seat of <HI>Rock-Savage,</HI> built on the A&s;cent of an Hill belonging to the &s;ame Family, whereof the la&s;t was the late Earl <HI>Rivers.</HI></P>
<P>On the South Side of the Park &s;tands <HI>Bee&s;ton</HI>-Ca&s;tle, upon an Hill environ'd with Mountains, and yet overlooks almo&s;t the whole County. It is very &s;trong, covers a great Extent of Ground, and is adorn'd with many Towers. It gives Name to an antient Family in this County.</P>
<P>From <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> we kept directly on Ea&s;t to <HI>Middle|wich,</HI> a large Market-town, with a &s;pacious Church, but chiefly noted for making Salt; where are Two excellent Brine-&s;eeths.</P>
<P>We followed the <HI>Weaver</HI> directly North to <HI>North|wich</HI> al&s;o famous for Brine-&s;prings, and for making great Quantities of the fine&s;t Salt by boiling the Water in large iron Pans of &s;mall Depth. As fa&s;t as the Salt cry&s;tallizes, they rake it out, and dry it in wicker Ba&s;kets of a conick Form. The Duty it brings in is very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e Fifty Years, on the South-&s;ide of the Town, they di&s;cover'd a great many Mines of Rock-&s;alt, which they continually dig up, and &s;end in great Lumps to the maritime Ports, where it is di&s;&s;olv'd, and made into eating Salt. We were let down by a Bucket 150 Feet deep to the Bottom of the Salt Quarry, a mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;ubterraneous Pro|&s;pect, looking like a Cathedral &s;upported by Rows of Pillars, and Roof of Cry&s;tal, all of the &s;ame Rock, tran&s;parent and glittering from the numerous Candles of the Workmen, labouring with their Steel Pick-axes in digging it away. This Rock-work extends to &s;everal Acres.</P>
<P>There is a good Church at <HI>Northwich,</HI> with a fine Roof, and &s;emicircular Choir.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lawton-yates</HI> they bore 60 Yards deep for the Salt Spring; at <HI>Ha&s;&s;al</HI> 47; at <HI>Wheelock</HI> 18; about <HI>Middlewich</HI> le&s;s; at <HI>Northwich</HI> it ri&s;es to open Day;
<PB N="340" REF="353">
which &s;eems to intimate, that the &s;alt Spring runs be|tween Layers of the Earth in an horizontal Line. Upon Boring, it ri&s;es with great Impetuo&s;ity, &s;o that the Workmen have &s;carce Time to get out of the Wells. This is all along the Side of a Brook that comes from a remarkable Hill called <HI>Mawcop,</HI> upon the Edge of <HI>Stafford&s;hire</HI>; &s;o that the Ground ri&s;es above the true Level in the mentioned Proportion.</P>
<P>From <HI>Northwich</HI> we travell'd North-ea&s;t, and came to <HI>Knutsford,</HI> a good Town, and finely &s;ituated. A Brook runs thro' it, and divides it into two. It has a Market and Town-hou&s;e, and a pretty good Pa|rochial Church.</P>
<P><HI>Altringham</HI> and <HI>Stockport,</HI> Two &s;mall Market-towns, lie higher up Northward, the fir&s;t near, and the other upon the Borders of <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI>; and hear|ing of nothing remarkable in them, we turned South-ea&s;t from <HI>Knutsford</HI> to <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> which they call in this County <HI>Maxfield.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Macclesfield</HI> is &s;ituate in the Fore&s;t of the &s;ame Name, a Town of great Antiquity, and very fair and &s;pacious. 'Tis under the Government of a Mayor, and enjoys many particular Privileges by virtue of the Court and Liberties of the Fore&s;t. It has a good Church with a high Spire Steeple, and a College adjoining to it, in which are buried a great many of the <HI>Savages:</HI> and here is al&s;o a good Free-&s;chool, and a thriving Manufacture of Buttons.</P>
<P>From hence we veer'd about, and came South-we&s;t to <HI>Congleton,</HI> near the Borders of <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> a fair Mayor-town and well-water'd on all Sides. It has Two Churches, and is noted for a good Trade in Gloves.</P>
<P>We then came to the Market-town of <HI>Sandbach,</HI> which is delightfully &s;ituated on a Branch of the <HI>Weaver.</HI> It has a fair Church, and in the Market-place &s;tand Two Cro&s;&s;es of Stone, with the Hi&s;tory
<PB N="341" REF="354">
of Chri&s;t's Pa&s;&s;ion ingraven on them. The Ale here is de&s;ervedly famed.</P>
<P>From <HI>Sandbach</HI> we went on Southward, and came to the great <HI>London</HI> Road at <HI>Namptwich,</HI> which &s;tands upon it. This Town is well-built, and the Streets look fair, having a great many Gentlemens Hou&s;es in them. The Church is a noble Edifice in the Form of a Cro&s;s, with the Steeple ri&s;ing from the Middle; but the Maintenance of the Mini&s;ter is mean and pitiful. The Inhabitants are rich, and carry on a good Trade in mo&s;t &s;ort of Commodities, but principally in making Salt and Chee&s;e, the latter exceeding all that is made in the County, as the Soil this Way is e&s;teemed the be&s;t, and, as 'tis &s;aid, was called by King <HI>Edward</HI> I. the <HI>Vale Royal.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having made my Circuit round the County, I &s;hall go from hence South to <HI>Whitchurch</HI> in <HI>Shrop|&s;hire.</HI> But I mu&s;t fir&s;t note two things of <HI>Che&s;hire:</HI> 1. That there is no Part of <HI>England,</HI> where there are equal Numbers of Gentry, of &s;uch antient and noble Extraction: Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> is very particular in their Names and De&s;cents, to whom therefore I mu&s;t refer. 2. That it is a County <HI>Palatine,</HI> and has been &s;o for many Ages, and its Government is di&s;tinct from any other, and very particular; it is admini&s;tred by a <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> a <HI>Judge Special,</HI> who is call'd <HI>Chief Ju&s;tice</HI> of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> two <HI>Barons</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> three <HI>Sergeants at Law,</HI> a <HI>Sheriff,</HI> an <HI>At|torney,</HI> an <HI>E&s;cheator,</HI> and all proper and u&s;ual &s;ub|ordinate Officers; and the Juri&s;diction of all the&s;e Offices is kept up, and pre&s;erv'd very &s;trictly; only we are to note, that the <HI>Judge Special,</HI> as he is call'd, tries only civil Cau&s;es, not criminal, which are left to the ordinary Judges of <HI>England,</HI> who go the Cir|cuits here, as in other Places.</P>
<P><HI>Whitchurch</HI> is a plea&s;ant, large, and populous Town, and has a very good Church, in which is the famous Monument of the great <HI>Talbot,</HI> fir&s;t E. of <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI>
<PB N="342" REF="355">
who was call'd in his Time the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ACHILLES, and who was &s;o renown'd in the Wars of <HI>France,</HI> that no Man in that Kingdom dared to encounter him &s;ingle-handed. He had ingraven on one Side of his Sword, <HI>Sum Talboti,</HI> and on the Rever&s;e, <HI>Pro vincere inimicos meos.</HI> His Epitaph is as follows, in capital Letters:
<Q>ORATE PRO ANIMA PRAENOBILIS DO|MINI, DOMINI IOHANNIS TALBOTT, QUONDAM COMITIS SALOPIAE, DOMINI TALBOTT, DOMINI FURNIVALL, DO|MINI VERDON, DOMINI STRANGE DE BLACKMERE, ET MARESCHALLI FRAN|CIAE, QUI OBIIT IN BELLO APVD BVR|DEWS VII. IVLII MCCCCLIII.</Q></P>
<P>This Town has a good Market, and a great many Gentry near it, whereof &s;ome are <HI>Roman-catho|licks.</HI> They tell us, that this Town, when King <HI>Charles</HI> I. remov'd his Standard from <HI>Nottingham</HI> to <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> rai&s;ed a whole Regiment for his Service.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd South, and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Wem,</HI> the Title given by King <HI>James</HI> II. to his Lord Chan|cellor <HI>Jefferies,</HI> thence we came to <HI>El&s;mere,</HI> which gives Title of Baron to the Duke of <HI>Bridg|water,</HI> and is famous for a great Lake or Mere, which gives the Town its Name, and which the People pretend has in &s;ome Places no Bottom. This Place is remarkable for good Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>And further on We&s;t, on the Confines of <HI>Den|bigh&s;hire,</HI> &s;tands <HI>O&s;we&s;try,</HI> a Bailiwick Market-town, famous formerly for the Sale of <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Cottons and Flanels, but now only for the la&s;t. It is inclo&s;ed with a Wall, and a Ditch, and fortified with a Ca&s;tle, and has a good Church without the Gate covered with
<PB N="343" REF="356">
Lead. From hence we came the &s;ame Night to <HI>Shrew&s;bury.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shrew&s;bury</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built out of the Ruins of the antient <HI>Uriconium.</HI> In the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, <HI>Roger</HI> Earl of <HI>Montgo|mery</HI> built a Ca&s;tle here, on the North Side, and a &s;tately Abbey, &s;ome Ruins of which are &s;till to be &s;een. It is a beautiful, large, plea&s;ant, populous, and rich Town; full of Gentry, and yet full of Trade too; for here likewi&s;e is a great Manufacture, as well of Flanel, as al&s;o of white Broad-cloth, which inriches all the Country round it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Severn</HI> in part &s;urrounds this Town, ju&s;t as the <HI>Thames</HI> does the <HI>I&s;le of Dogs</HI>; &s;o that it makes the Form of an Hor&s;e-&s;hoe. Over it are two fine Stone Bridges, upon one of which is built a very noble Gate, and, over the Arch of the Gate, the Statue of the great <HI>Llewellin,</HI> the Idol of the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> and their la&s;t Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>This is really a Town of Mirth and Gallantry, &s;omething like <HI>Bury</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> or <HI>Durham</HI> in the North, but much bigger than either of them, or in|deed than both together.</P>
<P>Over the Market-hou&s;e is kept a kind of Hall for the Manufactures, which are &s;old here weekly in very great Quantities; they &s;peak all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the Town, but on a Market-day you would think you were in <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the greate&s;t Market, the greate&s;t Plenty of good Provi&s;ions, and the cheape&s;t that is to be met with in all the We&s;tern Part of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Severn</HI> &s;upplies them here with excellent Salmon, but 'tis al&s;o brought in great Plenty from the <HI>Dee,</HI> which is not far off, and abounds with a very good Kind, and is generally larger than in the <HI>Severn.</HI> As an Ex|ample of the Cheapne&s;s of Provi&s;ions, we paid here, in a publick Inn, but a Groat a Night for Hay, and Sixpence a Peck for Oats, for our Hor&s;es, which is
<PB N="344" REF="357">
cheaper than we found it in the cheape&s;t Part of the North of <HI>England</HI>; all our other Provi&s;ions were in Proportion; and there is no doubt but the Cheap|ne&s;s of Provi&s;ions, joined to the Plea&s;antne&s;s and Healthine&s;s of the Place, draws a great many Fami|lies hither, who love to live within the Compa&s;s of their E&s;tates.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> calls it a City: and 'tis indeed equal to &s;everal good Cities in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;uperior to &s;ome. Near this Place was fought the bloody Battle between <HI>Henry Hot&s;pur,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> IV. King of <HI>England,</HI> in which the former was kill'd, and all his Army overthrown, and the Place is called <HI>Battle|field</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>Here are Five Churches, Two of them with lofty Spires. St. <HI>Chad</HI>'s, and St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, are &s;aid to be antiently collegiate. There are abundance of antient Monuments in them all, which I have not room to mention.</P>
<P>This Town will for ever be famous for the Re|ception it gave to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. who, after &s;etting up his Standard at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and finding no En|couragement there, remov'd to <HI>Shrew&s;bury,</HI> being in|vited by the Gentry of the Town and Country round, where he was receiv'd with &s;uch a general Affection, and hearty Zeal, that his Maje&s;ty recover'd him|&s;elf from the Di&s;couragement of his fir&s;t Step at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and rai&s;ed and compleated a &s;trong Army in le&s;s Time than could be imagin'd; in&s;omuch that, to the Surprize of the Parliament, and indeed of all the World, he was in the Field before them, and advanced upon them &s;o fa&s;t, that he met them Two-thirds onward of his Way to <HI>London,</HI> and gave them Battle at <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> near <HI>Banbury.</HI></P>
<P>But the Fate of the War turning afterwards again&s;t the King, the Weight of it fell heavy upon this Town, and almo&s;t ruin'd it.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="358">But they are now fully recover'd, and it is one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Towns in <HI>England.</HI> The Walls and Gates are yet &s;tanding, but u&s;ele&s;s; and the old Ca&s;tle is gone to Ruin, as is the Ca&s;e of almo&s;t all the old Ca&s;tles in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;hould not be forgotten, that notwith&s;tanding the Healthine&s;s of the Place, here broke out fir&s;t that unaccountable Plague, call'd, <HI>The Sweating Sickne&s;s, Anno</HI> 1551; which &s;pread it&s;elf thro' the whole King|dom, and afterwards into &s;everal foreign Nations.</P>
<P>Here is a good Free-&s;chool, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in this Part of <HI>England</HI>; built and endow'd by Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> with a very &s;ufficient Maintenance for a Chief or Head-Ma&s;ter, and Three Under-Ma&s;ters or U&s;hers. The Buildings are very &s;pacious, and particularly the Library, which has a great many Books in it. The School-ma&s;ters have al&s;o very hand&s;ome Hou&s;es to dwell in; &s;o that the whole has the Face of a College.</P>
<P>There was a fine School here before, erected by the Town's-people, and maintain'd &s;everal Years by their Contribution. But the Queen took the Matter into her own Hands, and built the whole Fabrick new from the Ground, endowing it liberally out of her own Royal Bounty.</P>
<P>Here I was &s;hew'd a very vi&s;ible and remarkable Appearance of the great antient Road or Way call'd <HI>Watling-&s;treet,</HI> which comes from <HI>London</HI> to this Town, and goes on from hence to the utmo&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>Wales.</HI> Remains of a Stone Bridge are to be &s;een in the Bottom of the River, when the Water is low. This Road is rai&s;ed a good Height above the Soil, and &s;o &s;trait, that upon an Eminence you may &s;ee it Ten or Fifteen Miles before you, and as much be|hind, over many Hill-tops an&s;wering one the other as a Vi&s;ta of Trees.</P>
<P>We lodg'd at an Inn called <HI>Ive&s;ey-bank,</HI> on the Borders between <HI>Stafford&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Shrop&s;hire.</HI> About

a Mile off in a large Wood &s;tands <HI>Bo&s;cobel-hou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>White-Ladies,</HI> as &s;ome call it, where the <HI>Pendrils</HI> lived, who pre&s;erved King <HI>Charles</HI> II. after <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> Battle, and famous for the Royal Oak. The Grand|daughter of that <HI>William Pendril</HI> &s;till liv'd in the Hou&s;e, when I was there. The Floor of the Gar|ret, which is a Popi&s;h Chapel, (formerly a Nunnery in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Family of <HI>Cook&s;ey</HI>) being matted, prevents any Su&s;picion of a little Cavity with a Trap|door over the Stair-ca&s;e where the King was hid. His Bed was artfully plac'd behind &s;ome Wain&s;cot, that &s;hut up very clo&s;e.

<P>A Bow-&s;hot from the Hou&s;e, ju&s;t by a Hor&s;e|track pa&s;&s;ing thro' the Wood, &s;tood the Royal Oak, into which the King and Col. <HI>Carlos</HI> climbed, by means of the Hen-roo&s;t Ladder, when they thought it no longer &s;afe to &s;tay in the Hou&s;e, the Family reaching them Victuals with the Nut-hook. It hap|pened, as the People related it to us, that whil&s;t the King and Colonel were in the Tree, a Party of the Enemy's Hor&s;e, &s;ent to &s;earch the Hou&s;e, came whi|&s;tling and talking along this Road; and when they were ju&s;t under the Tree, an Owl flew out of a neighbouring Tree, and hover'd along the Ground, as if her Wings were broken, which the Soldiers merrily pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>The Tree is now inclos'd within a Brick Wall, the In&s;ide whereof is cover'd with Laurel, of which we may &s;ay, as <HI>Ovid</HI> did of that of the <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> Pa|lace,&mdash;<HI>Mediamque tuebere quercum.</HI> For the Oak is in the Middle, almo&s;t cut away by Travellers, who&s;e Curio&s;ity leads them to &s;ee it.

<P><PB N="347" REF="360">After the Re&s;toration, the King, reviewing the Place, no doubt, with very different Emotions to what he had when he was in it, gather'd &s;ome of the Acorns, and &s;et them in <HI>St. James's Park</HI> or Gar|den, and us'd to water them him&s;elf.

<P>At <HI>Rugely,</HI> which is an hand&s;ome well-built Town, finely &s;ituated near the <HI>Trent,</HI> we came into the great <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> Road, or the North-we&s;t Road from <HI>London,</HI> which pa&s;&s;ing through this City from <HI>Warrington-bridge</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> falls into the <HI>Watling-&s;treet,</HI> mention'd before, about Three Miles South-ea&s;t from the Town, and cro&s;&s;es another an|tient Cau&s;eway or Road, call'd <HI>Icknild-&s;treet,</HI> about a Mile out of the City; &s;o that <HI>Litchfield</HI> lies, as it were, at the joining of all tho&s;e great Roads.

This Water parts the City into Two: one Part is call'd the Town, and the other the Clo&s;e; in the fir&s;t is the Market-place, a fine School, and a very hand&s;ome Ho&s;pital well endow'd. This Part is much the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous: but the other is the faire&s;t, has the be&s;t Buildings in it, and, among the re&s;t, the Cathedral Church, one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There are Two fine Cau&s;eways, which join the City and the Clo&s;e, with Sluices to let the Water pa&s;s; but tho&s;e were cut thro' in the Time of the late inte&s;tine Wars in <HI>England</HI>; and the Clo&s;e, which is wall'd about, and was then fortify'd for the King, was very &s;trong, and &s;tood out &s;everal Attacks again&s;t <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Men, and was not at la&s;t taken without great Lo&s;s of Blood on both Sides, being gallantly defended, and at la&s;t taken by Storm.</P>
<P>There are in the Clo&s;e, be&s;ides the Hou&s;es of the Clergy Re&s;identiaries, a great many very well-built, and well-inhabited Hou&s;es, which made <HI>Litchfield</HI> a Place of good Company, above all the Towns in this or the neighbouring Counties of <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> or <HI>Derby&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The See is very antient, and was once Archiepi|&s;copal, made &s;o by King <HI>Offa</HI>; and <HI>Eadulph</HI> the Archbi&s;hop was Metropolitan of all the Kingdom of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles</HI>; but it did not hold

it; then it &s;uffer'd another Diminution, by having the See of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> taken away, which was once Part of this.</P>
<P>They told us here a long Story of St. <HI>Chad,</HI> for|merly Bi&s;hop of this Church, and how he liv'd an Eremitical Life here, by the Spring near <HI>Stow</HI> Church, in a little Hovel or Cell.

<P>They have another Legendary Story al&s;o at <HI>Litch|field</HI>; namely, that a thou&s;and poor People, being in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Faith by the Care of <HI>Offa</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> were all martyr'd here in one Field by the <HI>Pagans</HI>; and that in the Field where they were &s;o murder'd, King <HI>O&s;wy</HI> of <HI>Northumber|land</HI> cau&s;ed a great Church to be built; and from thence the City bears for its Device an open Field, with mangled Carca&s;&s;es lying di&s;pers'd about in it, as if murder'd, and left unburied.</P>
<P>The Church, for the Elegancy and Regularity of the Building, may be e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t com|plete in <HI>England.</HI> The We&s;t-end is richly decorated with the Statues of all the Kings who reigned in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> from <HI>David</HI> to the Captivity. But it is too flat, and wants Projection, or, as Architects call it, <HI>Relief,</HI> to give it Boldne&s;s. The Two Towers are much too low for their Breadth, and look very heavy for want of Windows, e&s;pecially where the Bells hang. The circular Stair-ca&s;es projecting octa|gonally at one Angle only of each, without any of the other Three Angles an&s;wering, is a great Irre|gularity. But the Spires above them are carried up in an exceeding beautiful Ta&s;te, much beyond any other <HI>Gothick</HI> Spires that I have &s;een. The middle Tower and Spire of this Church are much higher than tho&s;e at the We&s;t-end, and are equally beau|tiful.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="368">The Spire de&s;igned for the Middle of <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> is an Imitation of the middle Spire of this Church.</P>
<P>The great Window over the middle Door is very large, and its Pediment finely adorn'd, a large Cro&s;s fini&s;hing the Top of it.</P>
<P>The Imagery and carv'd Work on the Front, as above, &s;uffer'd much in the late unhappy Times; and they told us, the Cro&s;s over the We&s;t Window was frequently &s;hot at by the rude Soldiers; but that they could not &s;hoot it down.</P>
<P>The Saints of tho&s;e Days al&s;o intirely ruin'd all the Ornaments of the In&s;ide, with the Bra&s;s In&s;crip|tions, Tombs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is built in the mid&s;t of a Bog for Security, and held out &s;ome fierce Attacks for King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and what the Out&s;ide &s;uffer'd, has been very well repair'd &s;ince the Re&s;toration, as well by the famous Bi&s;hop <HI>Hacket,</HI> as by the Bounty of &s;everal noble and generous Benefactors.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mona&s;ticon</HI> makes Mention of a Shrine given here for the Holy St. <HI>Chad,</HI> or St. <HI>Cedda,</HI> which co&s;t 200,000<HI>l.</HI> but I conceive that to &s;mell as much of the Legend, as the Miracles of St. <HI>Chad</HI> him&s;elf; &s;ince &s;uch a Gift at that Time mu&s;t be equal to Two Millions of our Money.</P>
<P>Antient Camps are found in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Litchfield.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Litchfield</HI> we came to <HI>Tamworth,</HI> a fine plea|&s;ant trading Town, eminent for good Ale, and good Company, of the middling Sort; and al&s;o for a fine Charity of the famous Book&s;eller, Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> who built and endow'd the noble Ho&s;pital in <HI>Southwark,</HI> called by his Name. The Town &s;tands on the River <HI>Tame,</HI> which runs through it, and divides it into Two Parts, one Part whereof is in this County, and the other in <HI>Warwick&s;hire.</HI> It is a Bailiwick Town, and a Place of good Account, tho' it has been much more con&s;iderable. Here was antiently a Palace of
<PB N="356" REF="369">
the <HI>Mercian</HI> Kings, and there is &s;till remaining a &s;quare Trench, call'd the King's Dyke. This Town was given by the Conqueror to the <HI>Marmyons,</HI> who built the Ca&s;tle here, and were hereditary Cham|pions of <HI>England,</HI> from whom that Office de&s;cended to the <HI>Dymokes</HI> of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Tamworth</HI> we came to <HI>Sutton-Colefield,</HI> a little Town &s;ituated in an excellent Air, and among plea&s;ant Woods, tho' but in a barren Soil; and then we came into the great Road again at <HI>Cole&s;hill</HI> in <HI>War|wick&s;hire,</HI> a &s;mall, but very hand&s;ome Market-town; from whence we came to <HI>Coventry,</HI> the Si&s;ter City to <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and join'd in the Title of See, which was for &s;ome little Time &s;eated here, but afterwards return'd to <HI>Litchfield.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coventry</HI> is a City of large Extent and populous, and drives a very great Trade: the Manufacture of Tammies is their chief Imploy, and next to that, weaving of Ribbons of the meane&s;t kind, chiefly black. The Buildings are very old, and in &s;ome Places very much decayed; the Timber-built Hou&s;es project forwards into the Street towards one another, in&s;omuch that in the narrow Streets they almo&s;t touch at the Top; a Method of Building formerly much practi&s;ed in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Tale of the Lady <HI>Godiva,</HI> who rode naked thro' the High-Street of this City, to purcha&s;e its Exemption from oppre&s;&s;ive Taxes, is held for &s;o cer|tain a Truth, that they will not have it que&s;tion'd upon any Account what&s;oever; and in Memory of it, the Inhabitants make a Proce&s;&s;ion yearly with a naked Figure of a Woman riding on Hor&s;e-back thro' the City; and the Picture of the poor Fellow who peep'd out of the Window to &s;ee her, is &s;till kept up, looking out of a Garret in the High-Street of the City: but Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> &s;ays po&s;itively, nobody look'd at her at all. Two Parliaments have been held in this City, both remarkably denominated; one
<PB N="357" REF="370">
in the 6th of King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. called <HI>Parliamentum Indoctorum</HI>; the other in the 38th of King <HI>Henry</HI> VI. called <HI>Parliamentum Diabolicum,</HI> becau&s;e of the At|tainder pa&s;s'd in it again&s;t the Hou&s;e of <HI>York</HI> and its Parti&s;ans.</P>
<P>At the Re&s;toration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. the Walls and Towers of the City were demoli&s;h'd, by that Prince's Command, and only the Gates of it left &s;tanding; by which the Beauty and Strength of the re&s;t may be gue&s;s'd at.</P>
<P>This City is a County incorporate of it&s;elf, and has a great many Towns within its Liberties, holds Pleas, and is govern'd by a Mayor, 10 Aldermen, and Sub-officers; but it had only Two Pari&s;h Churches, that of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> and the Church of <HI>St. Michael,</HI> which were unable to hold half the Inhabitants, till the Year 1734, when an Act pa&s;&s;ed for making the Church of <HI>Bablack</HI> in <HI>Coventry</HI> a Pari&s;h Church, and for appointing a Di&s;trict or Pari&s;h thereto, and for enabling the Ma&s;ter and U&s;her of the Free Grammar-&s;chool within the &s;aid City, to be the Rector and Lecturer of the &s;aid Pari&s;h Church, for all time to come. This is called in the Act the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> in the City of <HI>Coventry.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e Three Churches and Pari&s;hes, it has Four Steeples; and the Cro&s;s is notedly one of its greate&s;t Ornaments. The Roads are kept well pav'd to it for a Mile round. Here is a good Free-&s;chool, founded by <HI>John Hales,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> by the Name of the School of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. the Ma&s;ter of which is to be, for the future, the Mini&s;ter of the new Pari&s;h Church, as I have mentioned. It has a good Library; and there is al&s;o an Ho&s;pital for the Poor. But here is no Cathedral, as &s;ome have fal&s;ly &s;aid; neither is the great Church, &s;o called, either Collegiate or Conventual; but only a Mona&s;tery or Priory.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="371">Yet this City contended a great while for thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Honour, but could not carry it. In King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.'s Time, the Priory being di&s;&s;olv'd, the Church, which they would have call'd a Cathedral, was re|duc'd to a private Pari&s;h Church, and continues &s;o to this Day: 'tis al&s;o an Archdeaconry, and the Bi&s;hop is &s;tyled Bi&s;hop of <HI>Litchfield</HI> and <HI>Coventry.</HI></P>
<P>The Spire of the great Church is however very beautiful, and 100 Yards high. There is another good Church in the &s;ame Yard; the Cro&s;s, a fine <HI>Gothick</HI> Work, 66 Feet high; and in Niches are the Statues of &s;everal of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Kings. At the South-end of the Town &s;tands a tall Spire by it&s;elf, being what is left of the <HI>Grey Friers</HI> Conventual Church. The Town-hou&s;e is worth &s;eeing; the Windows of it are painted Gla&s;s, repre&s;enting &s;ome of the old Kings, Earls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who have been Benefactors to the Town.</P>
<P>And a Copy of <HI>Latin</HI> Ver&s;es are there to be read, in Prai&s;e of their Royal Benefactors, in which are named the <HI>Edwards,</HI> the <HI>Henries,</HI> the Black Prince, Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and the great Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Coventry</HI> we could by no means pa&s;s the Town of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Di&s;tance too being but about Six Miles, and a very plea&s;ant Way on the Banks of the River <HI>Avon:</HI> 'Tis famous for being the Re&s;idence of the great <HI>Guy,</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> of whom Tra|dition has deliver'd down to us &s;o many hyperbolical Accounts, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h his real Actions from what are fabulous. He flouri&s;hed in the Reign of <HI>Athel&s;tane,</HI> and decided the Fate of the Kingdom by Compact, in &s;ingle Combat with <HI>Colbrond</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> a Man of gigantick Stature, whom he &s;lew, and afterwards led a Hermit's Life, till his Death. They &s;hew us here his Ca&s;tle, his Helmet, his Sword, and tell abundance of things of
<PB N="359" REF="372">
him, which have &s;ome Appearance of Hi&s;tory, tho' not much Authority to &s;upport them. So I leave that Part to the curious Searchers into Antiquity, who may con&s;ult Mr. <HI>Camden, Rous, Dugdale,</HI> and other Antiquaries on that Subject, who tell us the Ca&s;tle was built before our Saviour's Time, and has been a Place of great Con&s;ideration ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Warwick,</HI> it is really a fine Town, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the Bank of the <HI>Avon,</HI> over which is a large and &s;tately Bridge, the <HI>Avon</HI> being now grown a pretty large River. <HI>Warwick</HI> has &s;uffer'd much from all Quarters. It was once de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI>; after which the famous <HI>Caractacus</HI> (who at the Head of the <HI>Silures</HI> oppos'd the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;o long) rebuilt it, erecting there al&s;o a Palace for him&s;elf. Then the <HI>Romans</HI> under <HI>O&s;torius,</HI> and after them the <HI>Saxons,</HI> greatly damaged it; and la&s;tly, the ravaging <HI>Danes</HI> ruined it.</P>
<P>Tho' it was a Corporation by Pre&s;cription, yet it took a Charter from <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and &s;ince from <HI>James</HI> I. and is now governed by a Bailiff, and 12 Burge&s;&s;es. It has a hand&s;ome Stone-built Market-hou&s;e upheld by Pillars; and here is a good Free-&s;chool, and a well-endow'd Ho&s;pital for decayed Gentlemen. Tho' it has been always accounted a hand&s;ome well-built Town, yet the Face of it is now quite alter'd and improv'd; for having been almo&s;t wholly reduc'd to a Heap of Rubbi&s;h, by a terrible Fire, which hap|pen'd the Fifth Day of <HI>September</HI> 1694, by the mere Accident of a Spark being blown from a Stick, as it was carried cro&s;s a Lane, to the Damage of 96,000<HI>l.</HI> it was rebuilt by Act of Parliament, and that in &s;o noble and beautiful a manner, that few Towns in <HI>England</HI> make &s;o fine an Appearance.</P>
<P>The Church and lofty Tower is new-built, except the Ea&s;t-end, which is old, and very good Work. There are many fine Bra&s;s Monuments of the Earls of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and others; al&s;o one of the Earl of
<PB N="360" REF="373">
<HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s unhappy Favourite; and many Chapels and Confe&s;&s;ionaries. In the Chapter-hou&s;e on the North-&s;ide is a Tomb of the Lord <HI>Brook.</HI> The Ca&s;tle &s;tands upon the River <HI>Avon</HI> on a &s;olid Rock, from who&s;e Bowels that and the whole Town may be &s;aid to have been dug. The Terrace of the Ca&s;tle, like that of <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> overlooks a beautiful Country, and &s;ees the <HI>Avon</HI> running at the Foot of the Precipice, from above 50 Feet per|pendicular Height; for the &s;olid Rock, from the Ri|ver on which it &s;tands, it 40 Feet high, but on the North-&s;ide it is even with the Town. The Build|ing is old, but has been often repair'd and beautify'd; and 'tis now a very agreeable Structure both within and without. The Apartments are very nicely con|trived, and the Communication of the remote&s;t Parts of the Building, one with another, is &s;o well pre|&s;erv'd by Galleries, and by the great Hall, which is very magnificent, that one finds no Irregularity in the whole Building, notwith&s;tanding its antient Plan, as it was a Ca&s;tle, built for Strength rather than a Palace to dwell in for Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A Stone Bridge with a Dozen Arches is at the Ca&s;tle; acro&s;s is a Stone-work Dam, where the Water falls over it as a Ca&s;cade under the Ca&s;tle Wall. It is fenc'd with a deep Mound, and &s;trong embattled double Walls and lofty Towers. On one Side the Area is a very high Mount. There are good Apartments and Lodgings next the River, the Re&s;idence of the Lord <HI>Brook.</HI> The Priory, on the North-ea&s;t of the Town overlooks a plea&s;ant woody Vale. There are a great many curious original Pictures in the Ca&s;tle, by <HI>Vandyke</HI> and other good Hands, of Kings, Queens, and other noble Per&s;on|ages, both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and Foreign.</P>
<P>A Mile out of Town, on the Side of a Hill, is a pretty retired Cell, called <HI>Guy-cliff.</HI> In an old Chapel is <HI>Guy</HI>'s Statue, Eight Feet high. The
<PB N="361" REF="374">
Fence of the Court is intire Rock, in which are cut Stables and Out-hou&s;es. They &s;hew'd us the rough Cave, where they &s;ay the famous <HI>Guy</HI> dy'd an Hermit.</P>
<P>While I was &s;tation'd, as I may &s;ay, at <HI>Warwick,</HI> I took a Turn about the Country, to view &s;uch Places of Note, as lay &s;omething out of my intended Rout. And fir&s;t, pa&s;&s;ing a Rivulet, I came to the antient <HI>Tripontium,</HI> plac'd in a plea&s;ant little Valley, the Sides of which are pretty &s;teep. The Road on the oppo&s;ite Hill looks perfectly like a Per&s;pective-&s;cene at the Theatre. This is a <HI>Roman</HI> Station, rightly plac'd at <HI>Dovebridge</HI> upon the <HI>Avon,</HI> running by <HI>Rugby</HI> to <HI>Warwick.</HI> The Stream here divides into two, with a Bridge over each. Upon one is a &s;hort In&s;cription in Stone, &s;hewing the three Counties which repair it.</P>
<P>Near this Place, at <HI>Legers-A&s;hby</HI> in <HI>Northampton|&s;hire,</HI> has been an old Town, as they &s;ay, de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Danes. Catesby,</HI> who hatch'd the Powder-plot, own'd the Town.</P>
<P>We went on to <HI>Daventry,</HI> a con&s;iderable Market-town, govern'd by a Mayor, Aldermen, Steward, and 12 Freemen. It lies on the great Road to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and is con&s;equently a great Thorough-fare, and well furni&s;h'd with good Inns; for it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly by the great Concour&s;e of Travellers that pa&s;s that way. It lies al&s;o on the old <HI>Watling-&s;treet</HI> Way. The Road was turn'd to pa&s;s through the Town, and runs on to <HI>Dun&s;more-heath,</HI> where it cro&s;&s;es the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e,</HI> and one Branch goes on to <HI>Coventry,</HI> and the other joins the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e,</HI> and goes on to a Place call'd <HI>High-cro&s;s,</HI> of which further anon, where it falls into the old <HI>Wat|ling-&s;treet,</HI> and both meet again near <HI>Litchfield.</HI></P>
<P>It is a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve the Cour&s;e of the&s;e old famous Highways, the <HI>Ikenild</HI> Way, the <HI>Watling-&s;treet,</HI> and the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e</HI>; in which one &s;ees &s;o lively a Repre&s;entatation of the antient <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI>

<P>From <HI>Daventry</HI> we went a little out of the Road, to &s;ee a great Camp, call'd <HI>Burrow-hill,</HI> upon the North End of an Eminence, cover'd over with Fern and and Go&s;s.

<P>At <HI>Weedon</HI> is &s;hewn the Scite of King <HI>Wolfhere</HI>'s Palace; the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings of this Province re&s;iding here. The Pa&s;tures call'd, <HI>The A&s;hes</HI> are the <HI>Roman</HI> Camp. St. <HI>Werberg,</HI> Daughter of King <HI>Wolfhere,</HI> and Abbe&s;s to the Nunnery in this Place, had here a Chapel. Abundance of very fine Stone, and many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins, have been dug up. <HI>Weedon</HI> now contains two Pari&s;hes, and has been a Market-town.</P>

<P>I now come to <HI>Northampton,</HI> the hand&s;ome&s;t Town in all this Part of <HI>England</HI>; but here, as at <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Beauty of it is owing to its Di&s;a&s;ter; for it was &s;o effectually burnt down, that very few Hou&s;es were left &s;tanding; and, altho' the Fire began in the Day-time, the Flame &s;pread it&s;elf with &s;uch Fury, and Speed, that they tell us, a Town&s;|man being two Miles off, upon a Hill, on the South-&s;ide of the Town, &s;aw the Fire at one End of it, ju&s;t as it began; and before he could reach the Town, with all the Speed he could, the other End was in Flames al&s;o. 'Tis now finely rebuilt with Brick and Stone, and the Streets made &s;pacious and wide. It has four Churches, two Ho&s;pitals, and a Charity-&s;chool well endow'd. The Market-place is &s;quare and &s;pacious; the A&s;&s;ize-hou&s;e is built after the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order. <HI>Allhallows</HI> Church is a pretty Edifice, with a Cupola, and a noble Portico, before it, of 8 lofty <HI>Ionick</HI> Columns.

<P>It was a large, well-built, and well-inhabited Town, with a fine Church, and Free-&s;chool. A dreadful Fire which happen'd here in <HI>July</HI> 1738, has made the Town &s;till more beautiful, tho' the Occa&s;ion was too melancholy to be wi&s;h'd for. It began at a Dyer's Hou&s;e in the Town, about two in the After|noon, and in the Space of Six Hours con&s;umed near 220 Hou&s;es, be&s;ides Out-hou&s;es, Barns, Stables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> amounting in the Whole to upwards of 800, mo&s;tly in the South and Ea&s;t Parts of the Town. The Wind being high, and but little Water to be had,
<PB N="369" REF="382">
the Fire was &s;o fierce and violent, that it &s;eem'd to break out at twenty Places at once, and the Inha|bitants were in &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that but few of them had Time to &s;ave any Goods, and many only the Cloaths on their Backs. As it happen'd chiefly among the Trading Men and Farmers, the Lo&s;s upon them was very heavy. But it was a good deal alle|viated by the &s;ignal Charity of the neighbouring Gentlemen and others, which &s;aved many of the poor Sufferers from peri&s;hing for Want.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>March,</HI> following this dreadful Fire, another happen'd at <HI>Findon,</HI> two Miles from <HI>Wellingborough,</HI> which con&s;umed 16 Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>From <HI>Boughton</HI> we went on to <HI>Harborough,</HI> a good Market-town, and great Thorough-fare, in|tending to go forward to <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI>; but Curio&s;ity turn'd us We&s;t a little, to &s;ee an old Town call'd <HI>Lutterworth,</HI> famous for being the Birth-place of <HI>John Wickliff,</HI> the fir&s;t Preacher of the Reformation in <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Di&s;ciples were afterwards called <HI>Lollards.</HI></P>
<P>The Church was lately beautify'd, and pav'd with a co&s;tly Pavement of chequer'd Stone; and the Pews are new, and every thing in it both in Church and Chancel, except the Pulpit, of thick Oak-Planks, &s;ix-&s;quare, which is pre&s;erv'd on account of its being <HI>Wickliff</HI>'s Pulpit.</P>
<P>Being thus got a little out of our Way, we turn'd We&s;t into the <HI>Watling-&s;treet</HI> Way, at <HI>High-cro&s;s,</HI> where the Fo&s;s cro&s;&s;es it, and which, I &s;uppo&s;e, occa&s;ion'd the Name, leaving <HI>Rugby</HI> in <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> a &s;mall Town, noted only for a great Number of Butchers, on the South-we&s;t of us. At this Cro&s;s we &s;eem'd to be in the Centre, and highe&s;t Ground of <HI>England</HI>; for from hence Rivers run every way.

<P>From hence we turn'd North-we&s;t, and came to <HI>Nun-Eaton,</HI> an ordinary manufacturing Town, on the River <HI>Anker,</HI> and then Northward to <HI>Ather&s;ton</HI>; and &s;o made a kind of &s;erpentizing Tour of it along the Borders of the two Counties of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> &s;ometimes in one and &s;ometimes in the other.</P>
<P><HI>Ather&s;ton</HI> is a Market-town famous for a great Chee&s;e-Fair, on the 8th of <HI>September,</HI> from whence the Chee&s;e-Factors carry the va&s;t Quantities of Chee&s;e they buy to <HI>Sturbridge</HI> Fair, which begins about the &s;ame Time, but holds much longer; and here 'tis &s;old again for the Supply of the Counties of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>

<P>Within three Miles of this Place is an antient Market-town, of the &s;ame Name, lying on a Hill, in a very healthy and plea&s;ant Air. The Soil all round it is fruitful, both for Tillage and Pa&s;ture.</P>

<P>The Sheep bred in this County and <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> which joins to it, are, without Compari&s;on, the lar|ge&s;t, and bear not only the greate&s;t Weight of Fle&s;h on their Bones, but al&s;o the greate&s;t Fleeces of Wool on their Backs, of any Sheep in <HI>England:</HI> and hence it is, that the&s;e Counties becomes va&s;t Magazines of Wool for the re&s;t of the Nation.

There are &s;everal Gate-ways to enter this Palace; and that which faces the Ea&s;t, has an Arch that is deemed a curious Piece of Architecture; over which in the Tower is kept the Magazine for the Militia of the County.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="389">Beneath this Ca&s;tle was a very fair Collegiate Ho|&s;pital, in the Church whereof, <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Lan|ca&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> his Son the fir&s;t Duke of it, were bury'd; the Ho&s;pital was built by the Duke in his old Age, and appropriated for the Maintenance of 100 poor People, in which al&s;o he placed a Dean and twelve Canons, Prebendaries, with as many Vicars and other Mini&s;ters, and ten able Women to &s;erve and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Poor and Weak. This, with Divine Service therein, doth in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t by certain Stipends paid out of the Duchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> Another Ho&s;pital built by Sir <HI>William Wig&s;ton,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. is in a very flouri&s;h|ing Condition there.</P>
<P><HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> is the <HI>Ratae Coritanorum</HI> of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The Trace of the <HI>Roman</HI> Wall is di&s;coverable with|out Difficulty, e&s;pecially in the Gardens about <HI>Senvy|gate,</HI> with a Ditch, which is very vi&s;ible. This was repair'd by <HI>Edelfleda,</HI> a noble <HI>Saxon</HI> Lady, in the Year 914. The old Work call'd <HI>Jewry-wall</HI> is compo&s;ed of Rag-&s;tone, and <HI>Roman</HI> Brick.</P>
<P>Not far off is a Place call'd <HI>Holy-bones,</HI> where abundance of Bones of Oxen have been dug up, which were the Remains of the <HI>Roman</HI> Sacrifices.</P>
<P>At <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins are found; a Pot full of them was dug up at the Entrance into <HI>White|friers.</HI> There are al&s;o many great Foundations. At St. <HI>Mary de Pree</HI>'s Abbey a Body was dug up, &s;up|po&s;ed to be Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Since its Di&s;&s;olution it has been made a Dwelling-hou&s;e, which has nothing left but the naked Walls, and the Spot of the Abbey is turned into a Garden. The only thing worth &s;eeing in it, is a plea&s;ant Ter|race-walk, &s;upported by an embattled Wall, with Lunets hanging over the River, and &s;haded with Trees.</P>
<P>In the Time of the <HI>Saxons, St. Margaret</HI>'s Church was an epi&s;copal See, and was very fine. Here, &s;ay &s;ome, King <HI>Richard</HI> III. was buried.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="390">Half a Mile Southward from <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> upon the Edge of the Meadows, is a long Ditch, call'd <HI>Raw|dikes</HI>; on the Banks of which, according to Tradi|tion, King <HI>Charles</HI> I. &s;tood to behold the Storm of the Town. That Prince lay at the Vicarage-hou&s;e at <HI>El&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>South-ea&s;t of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> lies <HI>Bille&s;den,</HI> a Market-town of no Note: and further South &s;till, is <HI>Hallaton,</HI> another Town noted for its Poverty, in the mid&s;t of a rich Soil.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fo&s;&s;e-way</HI> leads from hence through the North-we&s;t Part of this County; but entering <HI>Nottingham|&s;hire,</HI> it inclines North-ea&s;t, through the Vale of <HI>Belvoir,</HI> or, as it is commonly call'd, of <HI>Bever,</HI> to <HI>Newark.</HI> In all this long Tract, we pa&s;s through a rich and fertile Country, having in our Coa&s;t North-ea&s;tward the noble River <HI>Trent,</HI> for twenty Miles to|gether, often in our View.</P>
<P>But &s;ome Miles North of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> the River <HI>Wrek,</HI> which comes from the North-ea&s;t, and the <HI>Stour,</HI> which runs North-we&s;t, form a kind of Y; the <HI>Stour</HI> from <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> Southward making the Tail. In the Cour&s;e la&s;t-mentioned we pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Mont&s;orrel</HI> and <HI>Loughborough,</HI> both Market-towns, lying on the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e,</HI> which runs nearly parallel with the <HI>Stour,</HI> and makes one Side of the Y. The fir&s;t is &s;ituate under a great Eminence, and has a good Stone Bridge over the <HI>Stour</HI>; and the other is &s;eated among rich Meadow-ground, and is a fine agreeable Town. And on the <HI>Wrek,</HI> which makes the other Side of the Y, &s;tand <HI>Melton Mowbray,</HI> a large well-built con&s;ider|able Market-town, &s;ituate in a fertile Soil, almo&s;t &s;ur|rounded with a little River, call'd the <HI>Eye,</HI> over which it has two fine Bridges; and al&s;o <HI>Waltham on the Would,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> on the Downs) which is but a mean Market-town.</P>
<P><HI>Belvoir-ca&s;tle,</HI> &s;tanding within <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> but on the Edge of <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> is a truly noble Situa|tion,
<PB N="378" REF="391">
tho' on a very high Precipice; 'tis the antient Seat of the Dukes of <HI>Rutland,</HI> a Family ri&s;en by ju&s;t Degrees to an immen&s;e Height both of Honour and Wealth. I &s;hall mention the Hou&s;e again in my Return out of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bingham</HI> in <HI>Nottingham&s;hire</HI> lying in our Way to <HI>Newark,</HI> we pa&s;s'd through it. It is but a &s;mall Market-town, but is noted for a Par&s;onage of great Value.</P>
<P>At <HI>Newark</HI> one can hardly &s;ee, without Regret, the Ruins of that famous Ca&s;tle, which through all the civil War in <HI>England,</HI> kept a &s;trong Gari&s;on for the King to the la&s;t, and &s;o cut off the greate&s;t Pa&s;s into the North that is in the whole Kingdom; nor was it ever taken, 'till the King, pre&s;s'd by the Calamity of his Affairs, put him&s;elf into the Hands of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, which lay before it, and then commanded the Governor to deliver it up; after which it was demoli&s;h'd, that the great Road might lie open and free; and it remains in Rubbi&s;h to this Day.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle was built here by <HI>Alexander</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Stephen</HI>; and the Town took its Name from that New Work.</P>
<P>This Town was certainly rais'd from the neigh|bouring <HI>Roman</HI> Cities, and has been wall'd about with their Remains. The Northern Gate is compo&s;ed of Stones &s;eemingly of a <HI>Roman</HI> Cut: and perhaps they had a Town here; for many Antiquities are found about it. Here are two fine Stone Cro&s;&s;es. A Gentleman, digging to plant &s;ome Tree by the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e</HI> Road Side, di&s;cover'd four Urns in a &s;trait Line, and at equal Di&s;tances, in one of which was a bra&s;s <HI>Lar,</HI> or Hou&s;hold-God, an Inch and half long, but much con&s;um'd by Ru&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Newark</HI> is a very hand&s;ome well-built Town, &s;ituate on the <HI>Trent,</HI> under the Government of a Mayor and 12 Aldermen. The Market-place is a
<PB N="379" REF="392">
noble Square, and the Church is large and &s;pacious, with a curious Spire, which, were not <HI>Grantham</HI> &s;o near, might pa&s;s for the fine&s;t and highe&s;t in all this Part of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Trent</HI> divides it&s;elf here, and makes an I&s;land, and the Bridges lead ju&s;t to the Foot of the Ca&s;tle Wall; &s;o that, while this Place was in the Hands of any Party, as I have before hinted, there was no Travelling but by their Leave; but all the Travelling into the North at that Time was by <HI>Nottingham</HI> Bridge.</P>
