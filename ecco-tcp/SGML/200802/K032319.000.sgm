<P>_THIS Dedication, which I always in|tended to Addre&s;s to your <HI>HIGHNESS,</HI> and which
<PB REF="4">
I was in hopes might have Congratulated you upon your being in <HI>England,</HI> mu&s;t now wait for your Arri|val. I am &s;ure I &s;peak the Sen&s;e of every hone&s;t <HI>Briton,</HI> when I &s;ay that we expect it with the ut|mo&s;t Impatience.</P>
<P>Your Highne&s;s, who has been hitherto a Stranger a|mong us, cannot ea&s;ily con|ceive the Confidence we re|po&s;e in you; and it will, perhaps, hardly be believ'd in future Ages, that the fir&s;t Report of the Duke
<PB REF="5">
of <HI>Cambridge</HI>'s De&s;ign to Vi&s;it us, &s;hould rai&s;e the <HI>PUBLICK CREDIT</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h Nation.</HI></P>
<P>We are fill'd with Plea|&s;ure, to think that the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd of <HI>Princes</HI> will perfect him&s;elf in the Arts of Government under the Eye, and Direction of the Greate&s;t of <HI>Queens.</HI></P>
<P>If it is po&s;&s;ible there &s;hou'd be a Sett of Men among us who can wi&s;h to &s;ee their Country become a Province of <HI>France,</HI> it is, I think, pretty evident that
<PB REF="6">
your Re&s;idence in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will &s;oon put an End to &s;uch Impious Ex|pectations.</P>
<P>The Law of Nature makes it not improbable that you will one Day reign over us, and what may not our Po&s;terity expect from a Prince who in his early Years di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf in the Cau&s;e of Liberty, and led their Ance&s;tors on to Victory? The Balance of <HI>Europe</HI> will doubtle&s;s be kept &s;teady by that Hand which has already perform'd
<PB REF="7">
&s;uch Wonders in order to maintain it; our Religion, our Laws, and Civil Rites can be in no Danger under a Prince, who from his Con|ver&s;ation with our Nobility, and his Pre&s;ence at their mo&s;t important Debates, will have a perfect In&s;ight into all the Parts of our Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P><HI>Britain</HI> &s;hall from hence-forward claim your <HI>HIGH|NESS</HI> intirely as her own, and endeavour by the mo&s;t con|vincing Proofs of her Love and Re&s;pect, to make you
<PB REF="8">
forget the Court of your Il|lu&s;trious Father.</P>
<P>The Pains you have al|ready taken to acquire our Tongue, cannot fail to endear you to every <HI>Engli&s;hman;</HI> yet as the Idioms of a Lan|guage are the la&s;t Things we arrive at, I am in hopes an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Comedy will not be thought the mo&s;t improper Pre&s;ent that could be offer'd to your <HI>HIGHNESS.</HI></P>
<P>There is no doubt but you will &s;oon be made the Sub|ject of more Correct Pens, and receive a ju&s;t Tribute
<PB REF="9">
from the greate&s;t Authors of our Nation: In the mean Time, tho' I am, perhaps, the mo&s;t unworthy, I have at lea&s;t one Advantage, that I am the fir&s;t who have &s;hewn my Re&s;pect in this Manner, and &s;ued for your Protection.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Don't pretend to write a Preface, either to point out the Beauties, or to excu&s;e the Er|rors, a judicious Reader may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover in the following Scenes, but to give tho&s;e ex|cellent Comedians their Due, to whom, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure the be&s;t Dramatick Writers are ob|lig'd. The Poet and the Player are like Soul and Body, indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to one ano|ther; the correct Author makes the Player &s;hine, whil&s;t the judicious Player makes the Po|et's Fame immortal. I freely acknowledge my &s;elf oblig'd to the Actors in general, and to Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> in particular; and I owe them this Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, That their inimitable Action cou'd only &s;upport a Play at &s;uch a Sea&s;on, and among &s;o many Benefits. Let this encourage our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bards to Write, furni&s;h but the artful Player with Materials, and his Skill will lay the Foundation for your Fame.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t again repeat that which I meet with every where, I mean the ju&s;t Admiration of the Performance of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Old|field,</HI> and own that they much out-did in Action the &s;tronge&s;t of my Conceptions; for tho' Nature was my Aim in the la&s;t Act of this Comedy, yet Nature her&s;elf were &s;he to paint a Love Quarrel, wou'd only Copy them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><STAGE>Spoken by <HI>Mr.</HI> MILLS.</STAGE></HEAD>
<L>OUR <HI>Author</HI> fears the Criticks of the Stage,</L>
<L>Who like Barbarians, &s;pare nor Sex, nor Age;</L>
<L>She trembles at tho&s;e Cen&s;ors in the Pit,</L>
<L>Who think good Nature &s;hows a want of Wit:</L>
<L>Such Malice, Oh, what Mu&s;e can undergo it?</L>
<L>To &s;ave them&s;elves, they always Damn the Poet.</L>
<L>Our Author flies from &s;uch a Partial Jury,</L>
<L>As wary Lovers from the Nymphs of <HI>Drury:</HI></L>
<L>To the few Candid Judges for a Smile,</L>
<L>She humbly &s;ues to Recompence her Toil.</L>
<L>To the bright Circle of the Fair, &s;he next,</L>
<L>Commits her Cau&s;e, with Anxious Doubts perplext.</L>
<L>Where can &s;he with &s;uch hopes of Favour kneel,</L>
<L>As to tho&s;e Judges, who her Frailties feel?</L>
<L>A few Mi&s;takes, her Sex may well excu&s;e,</L>
<L>And &s;uch a Plea, No <HI>Woman</HI> &s;hou'd refu&s;e:</L>
<L>If &s;he &s;ucceeds, a <HI>Woman</HI> gains Applau&s;e,</L>
<L>What <HI>Female</HI> but mu&s;t favour &s;uch a Cau&s;e.</L>
<L>Her Faults,&mdash;If &s;uch there be:&mdash;Then,&mdash;pa&s;s 'em by,</L>
<L>And only on her Beauties fix your Eye.</L>
<L>In Plays, like Ve&s;&s;els floating on the Sea,</L>
<L>There's none &s;o Wi&s;e to know their De&s;tiny.</L>
<L>In this, howe'er the Pilot's Skill appears,</L>
<L>While by the Stars his con&s;tant Cour&s;e he &s;teers;</L>
<L>In this our <HI>Author</HI> does her Judgment &s;hew,</L>
<L>That for her Safety &s;he relies on You.</L>
<L>Your Approbation Fair ones, can't but move,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e &s;tubborn Hearts, which fir&s;t you taught to Love:</L>
<L>The Men mu&s;t all Applaud this Play of ours,</L>
<L>For who dares See with other Eyes, than Yours?</L>

<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you <HI>Frederick?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>At your Lord&s;hip's Service, I am glad to &s;ee you look &s;o well my Lord, I hope <HI>Antonio</HI> is out of dan|ger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite contrary, his Feaver increa&s;es they tell me, and the Surgeons are of Opinion his wound is mortal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Son <HI>Don Felix</HI> is &s;afe I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope &s;o too, but they offer large Rewards to apprehend him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>When heard your Lord&s;hip from him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not &s;ince he went, I forbad him writing till the publick News gave him an Account of <HI>Anto|nio</HI>'s Health, Letters might be intercepted, and the place of his Abode di&s;covered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Caution was good my Lord; tho' I am impatient to hear from <HI>Felix,</HI> yet his Safety is my chief Concern. Fortune has maliciou&s;ly &s;truck a Bar be|tween us in the Affairs of Life, but &s;he has done me the Honour to unite our Souls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not ignorant of the friend&s;hip between my Son and You, I have heard him commend your Morals and lament your want of noble Birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's Nature's fault my Lord, 'tis &s;ome comfort not to owe ones Misfortunes to ones Self, yet 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible not to regret the want of noble Birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis pity indeed &s;uch excellent Parts as you are Ma&s;ter of, &s;hould be eclip&s;ed by mean Extraction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such Commendation wou'd make me vain my Lord, did you not ca&s;t in the allay of my Extraction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no Condition of Life without its Cares, and it is the Perfection of a Man to wear 'em as ea&s;ie as he can; this unfortunate Duel of my Son's does not pa&s;s without Impre&s;&s;ion. But &s;ince 'tis pa&s;t Preven|tion, all my Concern is now, how he may e&s;cape the Puni&s;hment; if <HI>Antonio</HI> dies, <HI>Felix</HI> &s;hall for <HI>England.</HI> You have been there, what &s;ort of People are the <HI>Eng|li&s;h?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are by Nature, what the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> were by Di&s;cipline, couragious, bold, hardy, and in love with Liberty. Liberty is the Idol of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> under who&s;e Banner all the Nation Li&s;ts, give but the Word for Liberty, and &s;traight more armed Legions wou'd appear, than <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> keep in con&s;tant Pay.</P>

<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like their Principles; who does not wi&s;h for Freedom in all Degrees of Life? Tho' common Prudence &s;ometimes makes us act again&s;t it, as I am now obliged to do, for I intend to marry my Daugh|ter to <HI>Don Guzman,</HI> whom I expect from <HI>Holland</HI> eve|ry Day, whither he went to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large E&s;tate left him by his Uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will not &s;ure Sacrifice the lovely <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to Age, Avarice, and a Fool, pardon the Expre&s;&s;ion my Lord, but my Concern for your beauteous Daughter tran&s;ports me beyond that good Manners which I ought to pay your Lord&s;hip's pre&s;ence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't deny the ju&s;tne&s;s of the Character <HI>Frederick</HI>; but you are not in&s;en&s;ible what I have &s;uffer|ed by the&s;e Wars, and he has two things which render him very agreeable to me for a Son-in-Law, he is Rich and well Born; as for his being a Fool, I don't con|ceive how that can be any Blot in a Husband, who is al|ready po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a good E&s;tate.&mdash;A Poor Fool indeed is a very Scandalous thing, and &s;o are your Poor Wits, in my Opinion, who have nothing to be vain of, but the in&s;ide of their Sculls; now for <HI>Don Guzman</HI> I know I can rule him, as I think fit; this is acting the Politick part, <HI>Frederick,</HI> without which, it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep up the Port of this Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have you no Con&s;ideration for your Daughter's welfare my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Lop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is a Husband of twenty thou&s;and Crowns a Year, no Con&s;ideration? Now I think it a very good Con&s;ideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>One way, my Lord. But what will the World &s;ay of &s;uch a Match?</P>

<P>I cannot think your Daughter can have any Inclination for &s;uch a Husband.</P>

to enquire into, nor I believe ever &s;hall&mdash;Inclina|tion quotha! Parents would have a fine time on't, if they con&s;ulted their Childrens Inclinations!

No, no, Sir, it is not a Father's bu&s;ine&s;s to follow his Childrens Inclinations till he makes him&s;elf a Beggar.</P>

<L>CU&s;tom with all our Modern Laws combin'd,</L>
<L>Has given &s;uch Power de&s;potick to Mankind,</L>
<L>That We have only &s;o much Vertue now,</L>
<L>As they are pleas'd in favour to allow.</L>
<L>Thus like Mechanick Work we're us'd with Scorn,</L>
<L>And wound up only, for a pre&s;ent Turn;</L>
<L>Some are for having our whole Sex en&s;lav'd,</L>
<L>Affirming we've no Souls, and can't be &s;av'd;</L>
<L>But were the Women all of my Opinion,</L>
<L>We'd &s;oon &s;hake off this fal&s;e u&s;urp'd Dominion;</L>
<L>We'd make the Tyrants own, that we cou'd prove,</L>
<L>As fit for other Bu&s;ine&s;s as for Love.</L>
